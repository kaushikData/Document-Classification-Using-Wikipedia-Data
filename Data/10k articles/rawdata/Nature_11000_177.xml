'''Shayaa Bin Abraham-Joseph''' (born October 22, 1992), better known by his stage name '''21 Savage''', is an American [[rapper]], record producer, and songwriter from [[Atlanta, Georgia]]. Abraham-Joseph grew up around criminality and eventually dropped out of school, beginning to rap in 2013 after the death of a friend. He gained attention in the [[Atlanta]] underground for the 2015 mixtape ''[[The Slaughter Tape]]'' before attaining nationwide attention following the [[Metro Boomin]] collaborative album ''[[Savage Mode]]'' (2016), its lead single "[[X (21 Savage and Metro Boomin song)|X]]", and his collaboration with Drake, "[[Sneakin']]".&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.interviewmagazine.com/music/21-savage-seth-rogen-interview|title=21 Savage chops it up with Seth Rogen|date=2018-04-26|work=Interview Magazine|access-date=2018-07-10|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life==
Shayaa Bin Abraham-Joseph was born on October 22, 1992, in Atlanta, Georgia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.allmusic.com/artist/21-savage-mn0003515232/biography|title=Biography &amp; History|last=Jeffries|first=David|website=[[AllMusic]]|accessdate=February 22, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Birthplace2"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://schedule.sxsw.com/2016/events/event_MS37401|title=21 Savage|author=&lt;!--Not stated--&gt;|website=[[South by Southwest]]|access-date=May 2, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was raised by his mother Heather, who is of [[People of Dominica|Dominican]] origin, and his four brothers and six sisters, though one is now deceased due to a shooting after a [[Illegal drug trade|drug deal]] gone haywire.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://djbooth.net/features/2016-11-22-brutal-story-behind-21-savage-dagger-face-tattoo|title=The Brutal Story Behind 21 Savage's Dagger Face Tattoo|last=James|first=Andy|date=November 22, 2018|website=[[DJBooth]]|access-date=May 2, 2018|quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the seventh grade, Abraham-Joseph was banned permanently from every single school in the [[DeKalb County School District]] due to gun possession.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite AV media|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v1CmVcwIyKo|title=21 Savage Interview With The Breakfast Club (8-4-16)|date=August 4, 2016|people=[[Charlamagne tha God]], [[DJ Envy]]|publisher=[[The Breakfast Club (radio show)]]|location=[[New York City]]|access-date=May 6, 2018|medium=Video}}&lt;/ref&gt; This led him to begin attending schools around the [[Atlanta metropolitan area]] before being sent to a youth detention center.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.hotnewhiphop.com/everything-you-need-to-know-about-21-savage-news.22853.html|title=Everything You Need To Know About 21 Savage|work=HotNewHipHop|access-date=2017-08-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; After being released from the youth detention center, he completed eighth grade through an alternative program before finishing a semester of high school, dropping out in his freshman year following multiple exclusions which Abraham-Joseph said he was "exhausted" by.&lt;ref name=":02"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.thefader.com/2016/08/04/21-savage-the-breakfast-club-interview|title=21 Savage Talks Being An "A" Student, Losing His Best Friends On The Breakfast Club|work=The FADER|access-date=2018-07-10|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After dropping out, Abraham-Joseph joined a street gang affiliated with the wider [[Bloods]] street gang&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; and became a full-time drug dealer, mainly selling cannabis.&lt;ref name=":02" /&gt; He also took parts in other criminal activities including robbery and grand theft auto regularly, though only being arrested once after contraband was found in a car he was driving.&lt;ref name=":12"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.gq.com/story/21-savage-profile-2018|title=21 Savage: From Robbin’ Season to Role Model|last=Wood|first=Samuel Hine, Geordie|date=2018-06-27|work=GQ|access-date=2018-07-10|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2011, when Abraham-Joseph was 19, he lost his "right hand" man, Larry in a shootout.&lt;ref name=":02" /&gt; In 2013, on his 21st birthday, Abraham-Joseph was shot six times by rival gang members and his brother Johnny "Tay-Man" Abraham-Joseph was killed during an attempted robbery.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.thefader.com/2015/10/01/feature-21-savage|title=Meet 21 Savage, Atlanta’s Most Respected New Rapper|website=[[The Fader]]|access-date=August 24, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career==
===2014–15: Early releases===
Following the death of his friend in a shootout on his 21st birthday, Abraham-Joseph began rapping, naming himself after the event&lt;ref name=":12" /&gt; though Savage came from Instagram predictions.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.capitalxtra.com/features/facts/21-savage/|title=19 Facts You Need To Know About 'Rockstar' Rapper 21 Savage|work=Capital XTRA|access-date=2018-07-10|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; His music career was originally subsidized by the uncle of his deceased friend, giving him money for studio time in 2013.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; On November 12, 2014, 21 Savage's debut single, "Picky", produced by DJ Plugg, was released. It was later included on his debut mixtape, ''[[The Slaughter Tape]]'', which was released on May 25, 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.livemixtapes.com/mixtapes/34127/21-savage-the-slaughter-tape.html|title=21 Savage - The Slaughter Tape|work=LiveMixtapes|accessdate=April 27, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The release made him what [[Interview (magazine)|Interview]] called an "underground hero in Atlanta."&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

On July 2, 2015, 21 released a collaborative EP, ''Free Guwop'', with [[Sonny Digital]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.livemixtapes.com/mixtapes/35036/21-savage-free-guwop-ep.html|title=21 Savage - Free Guwop EP|work=LiveMixtapes|accessdate=27 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is a tribute EP to fellow rapper and influence [[Gucci Mane]].

In 2017, his debut studio album, ''[[Issa Album]]'', reached at number two on the US ''Billboard'' 200 chart.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.billboard.com/articles/columns/chart-beat/7866158/21-savage-haim-billboard-200-albums-chart-top-10|title=21 Savage &amp; Haim Debut in Top 10 on Billboard 200 Albums Chart|last=Caulfield|first=Keith|date=July 16, 2017|work=[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]|accessdate=July 17, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Its lead single, "[[Bank Account (song)|Bank Account]]", charted in the top 20 on the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://headlineplanet.com/home/2017/08/08/hot-100-niall-horans-slow-hands-enters-top-15-21-savages-bank-account-top-20/|title=Hot 100: Niall Horan’s "Slow Hands" Enters Top 15, 21 Savage’s "Bank Account" Top 20|date=August 7, 2017|work=Headline Planet|access-date=August 9, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Later that year, he was featured on [[Post Malone]]'s single "[[Rockstar (Post Malone song)|Rockstar]]", which peaked at number one on the ''Billboard'' Hot 100, and broke several records.&lt;ref name="XXL Magazine2" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.xxlmag.com/news/2018/01/post-malone-rockstar-breaks-spotify-global-record/|title=Post Malone Breaks Spotify Global Record With ''Rockstar'' - XXL|website=XXL Magazine|publisher=Townsquare Media|access-date=2018-02-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.billboard.com/articles/columns/hip-hop/8031270/post-malone-rockstar-platinum-21-savage|title=Post Malone &amp; 21 Savage's 'Rockstar' Is Now Certified Platinum|work=Billboard|access-date=2018-02-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In April 2018, Abraham-Joseph had a guest appearance on [[Young Thug]]'s extended play ''[[Hear No Evil (Young Thug EP)|Hear No Evil]]'' along with fellow rappers [[Nicki Minaj]] and [[Lil Uzi Vert]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thefader.com/2018/04/13/young-thug-hear-no-evil-nicki-minaj-21-savage|title=Young Thug drops Hear No Evil EP|last=Maicki|first=Salvatore|date=April 13, 2018|website=The Fader|access-date=May 6, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Later that month he also appeared on the single "Outstanding" by [[SahBabii]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.xxlmag.com/rap-music/new-music/2018/04/sahbabii-21-savage-new-song-outstanding/|title=Listen to SahBabii and 21 Savage's New Song "Outstanding"|last=India|first=Lindsey|date=April 20, 2018|website=XXL Magazine|publisher=Townsquare Media|access-date=May 2, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; In March 21 he was featured on the single "Rover 2.0", which is part of [[BlocBoy JB]]'s [[Simi (mixtape)|Simi]] mixtape.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.stereogum.com/1988300/blocboy-jb-rover-2-0-feat-21-savage/music/|title=BlocBoy JB – "Rover 2.0" (Feat. 21 Savage)|last=Breihan|first=Tom|date=March 23, 2018|website=[[Stereogum]]|publisher=[[Eldridge Industries]]|access-date=May 1, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.xxlmag.com/rap-music/new-music/2018/05/blocboy-jb-simi-mixtape/|title=BlocBoy JB Drops 'Simi' Mixtape Featuring Drake, Lil Pump and More|last=Coleman II|first=C. Vernon|date=May 4, 2018|website=XXL Magazine|publisher=Townsquare Media|access-date=May 9, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the following month, he was featured on [[Ty Dolla Sign]]'s "Clout", which is part of the upcoming deluxe edition of last years's ''[[Beach House 3]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine|last=Darville|first=Jordan|date=May 9, 2018|title=Ty Dolla $ign recruits 21 Savage for "Clout"|url=http://www.thefader.com/2018/05/09/ty-dolla-sign-21-savage-clout|magazine=The Fader|location=New York City|access-date=May 11, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On October 31, 2018, [[Halloween]], Abraham-Joseph posted on his Instagram a picture of a man in silhouette jumping in the air in the direction away from a large blaze. In the bottom right corner of the picture there is a "Parental Advisory" notice, as there oftentimes is on the cover of rap releases. Abraham-Joseph also tagged Metro Boomin in the post. For these reasons, some speculated it to be a sequel to 2017's ''Without Warning'' record. However, it turned out to be the cover for Metro’s debut solo album, ''[[Not All Heroes Wear Capes]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.instagram.com/p/BpnfcqeBtAT/?hl=en&amp;taken-by=21savage|title=Saint Laurent Don on Instagram: "y’all know what season it is @metroboomin 4L"|website=Instagram|language=en|access-date=2018-11-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Musical style ==
Called "one of the last street niggas left making music" by frequent collaborator Metro Boomin,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.thefader.com/2015/10/01/feature-21-savage|title=Meet 21 Savage, Atlanta’s Most Respected New Rapper|work=The FADER|access-date=2018-07-10|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Abraham-Joseph's music is heavily autobiographic with emphasis on violent and criminal aspects of his past including murder and drug dealing.&lt;ref name=":12" /&gt;

==Controversies==
In 2018, 21 Savage reportedly started a movement called "Guns Down, Paintballs Up" which was intended to reduce gun violence.&lt;ref name="CBS2"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.cbsnews.com/news/paintball-wars-initially-intended-to-curb-gun-violence-linked-to-2-deaths/|title="Paintball wars," initially intended to curb gun violence, linked to 2 deaths|last=Diaz|first=Adriana|date=May 1, 2018|website=[[CBS News]]|access-date=May 2, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The head of the [[Detroit Police Department]], [[James Craig (police chief)|James Craig]], described the movement as "well-intentioned, however, misguided".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.cbsnews.com/news/paint-up-guns-down-detroit-paintball-arrests-2018-04-27/|title=Detroit police cracks down on citywide "paintball wars"|author=&lt;!--Not stated--&gt;|date=April 21, 2018|website=CBS News|access-date=May 2, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation-now/2018/04/27/detroit-police-crack-down-citywide-paintball-wars/560019002/|title=Detroit police to crack down on citywide 'paintball wars'|last1=Patterson|first1=Brandon|last2=Zaniewski|first2=Ann|date=April 27, 2018|website=[[USA Today]]|publisher=[[Gannett Company]]|access-date=May 2, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The movement has been linked to several cases of property crime and homicide.&lt;ref name="CBS2" /&gt;&lt;ref name="USA Today2"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation-now/2018/05/01/paintball-wars-spate-shootings/569407002/|title=Paintball shootings splatter cities after rapper calls for swapping handguns for paintball weapons|last1=Mensch|first1=Jessica|last2=Luthern|first2=Ashley|date=May 1, 2018|website=USA Today|publisher=Gannett Company|access-date=May 2, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; 21 Savage has not commented on the matter, although he paid for the funeral of a 3-year old who was killed in a related incident.&lt;ref name="CBS2" /&gt;&lt;ref name="USA Today2" /&gt;

Controversy arose after Abraham-Joseph pulled out a firearm during a pool party on June 11, 2018.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.billboard.com/articles/columns/hip-hop/8460380/21-savage-gun-atlanta-brawl|title=21 Savage Draws Gun During Atlanta Pool Party Brawl|work=Billboard|access-date=2018-07-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; Abraham-Joseph was given the firearm by a friend after seeing an opposing crew member also pull out a pistol.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.vibe.com/2018/06/21-savage-pull-out-a-gun/|title=21 Savage Pulls Out A Gun During A Brawl: Watch|date=2018-06-10|work=Vibe|access-date=2018-07-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2587">The '''6N2P''', (Russian: '''6Н2П'''), also sometimes spelled in English '''"6H2Pi"''', is a miniature 9-pin dual [[triode]] [[vacuum tube]] manufactured in [[USSR]], [[Russia]] and [[China]] with characteristics similar to the [[RCA]] [[12AX7]].  The most significant difference between the two is that 6N2P has its two filament elements connected in parallel, unlike the series filament connection of the 12AX7, and it is thus only possible to operate it from a 6.3 volt, 340 mA filament supply (whereas a [[12AX7]] may be operated from either 6.3 or 12.6 volts, at 300 mA or 150 mA, respectively.)  The 6N2P also has slightly lower gain than a [[12AX7]]. The 6N2P's slightly lower gain and higher filament draw is similar to the 5751 tube (introduced in the mid-'50s) and was sold in quantity to the US military. The 5751 tube may be operated from 6.3 volts at 350 mA (the higher current draw is for increased reliability) for use in avionics.

[[File:Four_6n2p_vacuum_triodes.jpg|thumb|right|220px|Different 6N2P versions]]

In the 1970s an improved and more rugged version of the 6N2' was introduced, designated 6N2P-EV (Russian: 6Н2П-ЕВ). The 5751WA tube is a rugged military version of the 5751, and is the closest equivalent to the 6N2P-EV. Currently, a [[12AX7]] variant derived from the 6N2P-EV is being produced by [[Sovtek]], under the designation 12AX7WA. 

A [[China|Chinese]] version of 6N2P exists, labeled in Latin lettering (instead of [[Cyrillic]]) 6N2.

In the 1990s a (now extinct) line of "Red Bear" [[guitar amplifiers]] was being produced in [[Russia]] by Novik Ltd. and distributed in the [[United States]] by [[Gibson Guitar Corporation]].  These amplifiers used 6N2P tubes instead of the much more common [[12AX7]], prompting user modifications of the amplifier to [[12AX7]], because the original Russian 6N2P was scarcely available outside of Russia.

If you can clear this up, please do, and use as an actual caption for the photo. Thanks!)  In the photo, from left to right - 6N2P produced in [[USSR]] in 1967, 1974, 6N2 produced in [[China]] and [[Soviet Union]] 6N2P-EV (left), produced in 1980.--&gt;

[[File:Modern floating surface algae scrubber filter, floating on top of aquarium.jpg|thumb|Modern algae scrubber designs use upflowing air bubbles to generate turbulence; when illumination is added, [[algae]] grows inside the unit and consumes nutrients.]]
[[File:Layout of an algae scrubber.jpg|thumb|Commercial floating surface algae scrubber uses red [[LED lights]] and up-flowing air bubbles to cause algae to grow in the growth compartment.

[[File:Harvesting (cleaning) algae that has grown in an algae scrubber.jpg|thumb|Periodic removal of the algae that has grown inside of an algae scrubber removes nutrients ([[ammonia]], [[nitrate]], [[phosphate]]) from the aquarium water, thus providing the needed filtration.]]
An '''algae scrubber''' is a water [[Filter (aquarium)|filtering]] device (not to be confused with a [[Sponge (material)|scrubber pad]] used to clean glass) which uses light to grow [[algae]]; in this process, undesirable chemicals are removed from the water.&lt;ref name=nutrientcycling&gt;[http://www.reefbase.org/resource_center/publication/main.aspx?refid=10859 Nutrient Cycling In The Great Barrier Reef Aquarium. Proceedings of the 6th International Coral Reef Symposium, Australia, 1988, Vol. 2]&lt;/ref&gt; Algae scrubbers allow [[marine aquarium|saltwater]], [[freshwater aquarium|freshwater]] and pond [[fishkeeping|hobbyists]] to operate their tanks using natural filtration in the form of [[primary production]], much like oceans and lakes.

== Concepts ==
An algae scrubber filters water by moving water rapidly over a rough, highly illuminated surface, which causes algae to start growing in large amounts. As the algae grow, they consume nutrients such as [[nitrate]], [[phosphate]], [[nitrite]], [[ammonia]], [[ammonium]] and even metals such as copper from the water.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www3.interscience.wiley.com/journal/120083425/abstract Algal Response To Nutrient Enrichment In Forested Oligotrophic Stream. Journal of Phycology, June 2008]&lt;/ref&gt; These nutrients are normally a problem in aquariums and ponds because they cause nuisance algae to grow, and also because they cause sickness and/or other problems in aquarium fish, invertebrates and corals.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=76o5N8Jq6IAC&amp;printsec=frontcover Fish Disease: Diagnosis and Treatment, Second Edition, 2010]&lt;/ref&gt; An algae scrubber allows algae to grow, but the algae grow inside the filter instead of in the aquarium or pond. This removes excess nutrients (scrubs the water), diminishing nuisance algae in the aquarium or pond . Nuisance algae in the aquarium or pond are not to be confused with the desired algae in the algae scrubber filter itself. The algae that grow in the algae scrubber can then be removed, or fed back to the livestock.

Both [[iron fertilization]] and [[ocean nourishment]] are techniques that boost the primary production of algae in the ocean, which consumes massive amounts of nutrients and [[carbon dioxide|CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;]]. It is this same consumption of nutrients that algae perform in an aquarium or pond.

Algae scrubbers are used in both saltwater and freshwater, and remove nuisance algae of multiple types: [[cyanobacteria|cyano or slime]], [[Valonia (alga)|bubble]], [[Bryopsis|hair]], ''[[Chaetomorpha]]'', ''[[Caulerpa]]'', and [[Yellow-green algae|film]] algae, as well as [[dinoflagellate]]s and ''[[Aiptasia]]''.

== History ==

[[File:WalterAdey.jpg|left|border|thumb|Dr. Walter Adey]]

The algae scrubber was invented by [[Walter H. Adey|Dr. Walter Adey]], who beginning in the late 1970s, was Director of the Marine Systems Laboratory at the Museum of Natural History, Smithsonian Institution (Washington DC, USA).&lt;ref&gt;[http://botany.si.edu/staff/staffPage.cfm?thisName=66 Smithsonian Institution, Dept. of Botany]&lt;/ref&gt; His research of various types of algae, especially in their ecological role on coral reefs, gave him insight into how the ocean (in particular a reef) "recycles" nutrients. He designed and built various exhibits ranging in size up to 3000 gallons, and modeled different aquatic ecological systems including a tropical coral reef/lagoon which "after 8 years of closure [to the environment], had its chemical parameters controlled solely by an algal turf scrubber. This system, studied by a multidisciplinary team of biologists, demonstrated calcification [coral growth] rates equal to the best 4 percent of wild reefs, and at 543 identified species, and an estimated 800 species, ranked per unit area as the most biodiverse reef ever measured."&lt;ref&gt;[http://walteradey.com/ecosystems.php WalterAdey.com]&lt;/ref&gt;

In three editions of his book, Dynamic Aquaria, Dr Adey described his work in detail and discussed in scientific principles the physical, chemical, and biological considerations for building a functioning ecological system within an enclosure, from aquarium size, to microcosm (up to 5000 gallons), or mesocosm size (&gt;5000 gallons). In describing the algal turf scrubber he designed, he explained that removing excess nutrients was not its only function. By operating the scrubber at night when the main tank had shifted to a different respiratory phase (plants were now absorbing oxygen rather than producing it) the scrubber maintained oxygen levels and helped buffer pH by preventing high levels of carbon dioxide from building up.

[[File:Upflowing scrubber.jpg|thumb|Upflowing scrubber]]
"Recycling" means how the nutrients go from plants to animals, and back to plants again. On land, you see recycling by following the oxygen flow: Green plants use carbon dioxide and release oxygen; animals use this oxygen and release carbon dioxide. In oceans and lakes, the nutrients go from algae to animals, and back to the algae again.

[[File:Nutrient-cycle hg.png|right|border|thumb|Aquatic nutrient cycle]]

Dr. Adey built several versions of algae scrubbers for aquariums at the Smithsonian. He called them "Algal Turf Scrubbers", because at the time it was believed that "turf" algae was the best type of algae to grow in a scrubber. He also was granted the first U.S. patent for a dumping-bucket algae scrubber,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.google.com/patents/about?id=NogyAAAAEBAJ&amp;dq=U.S.+Patent+4333263 U.S. Patent 4333263, Issue Date June 8, 1982]&lt;/ref&gt; which described a complex dumping device that poured water onto a horizontal surface, thus simulating waves in a reef environment. After several years of development, he participated in a test of a large algae scrubber on the Great Barrier Reef Aquarium: "The Reef Tank represents the first application of algal scrubber technology to large volume aquarium systems. Aquaria using conventional water purification methods (e.g. bacterial filters) generally have nutrient levels in parts per million, while algal scrubbers have maintained parts per billion concentrations [much lower], despite heavy biological loading in the Reef Tank. The success of the algal scrubbers in maintaining suitable water quality for a coral reef was demonstrated in the observed spawning of scleractinian corals and many other tank inhabitants."&lt;ref name=nutrientcycling/&gt;

Unfortunately, it was not known at the time (1988) that calcium and alkalinity needed to be added to an enclosed reef tank, in order to replace that which is utilized by the growing calcifying organisms. Even five years after that, the Pittsburgh Zoo was just starting to test a "mesocosm" scrubber reef tank to see if calcium levels would drop: "It was hypothesized that Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; and the substitutive elements Sr&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; and Mg&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; might have reduced concentrations in a coral reef microcosm due to continuous reuse of the same seawater as a consequence of the recycling process inherent in the coral reef mesocosm." [...] "The scleractinians (Montastrea, Madracis, Porites, Diploria, and Acropora) and calcareous alga (Halimeda and others) present in the coral reef mesocosm are the most likely organisms responsible for the significant reduction in concentration of the Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; and Sr&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; cations." [...] "Ca is not normally a biolimiting element, and strontium is never a biolimiting element; HCO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; [alkalinity] can be. It appears that, because of a minor limitation in the design parameters of the mesocosm, these elements and compounds may have become limiting factors. [...] It is surprising that the organisms could deplete the thousands of gallons of seawater (three to six thousand) of these elements even within two or more years."&lt;ref&gt;An Introduction to the Biogeochemical Cycling of Calcium and Substitutive Strontium in Living Coral Reef Mesocosms http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/zoo.1430120505/abstract&lt;/ref&gt; After other researchers added calcium and/or connected their tanks to the ocean (which also supplies calcium and alkalinity), corals began growing again. Nevertheless, "problem" nutrients (ammonia, ammonium, nitrate, nitrite, phosphate, CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, metals) were always kept at very low numbers.

Dr. Adey licensed his patent to very few individuals, who for a short number of years sold a limited number of aquarium scrubbers to hobbyists. The complexity of the design, however, and the cost of the license, caused the scrubber units to be very expensive. This, combined with the fact that the units were noisy, splashy, and unreliable (the dumping mechanism would get stuck) caused the sales to be slow. The scrubbers were just starting to make headway into the aquarium hobby in the 1990s when Adey decided to withdraw his license and no longer allow anybody to make or sell them. He turned his attention instead to commercial and industrial applications, and entered private business making large scale scrubber installations for lakes and rivers.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hydromentia.com/Products-Services/Algal-Turf-Scrubber/Product-Documentation/Assets/ATS-Technical-Brochure.pdf Hydromentia Water Treatment Technologies]&lt;/ref&gt;

As the internet developed in the 1990s, aquarium and pond hobbyists began discussing nuisance algae problems, and started noticing a trend: Aquariums and ponds with very high amounts of nuisance algae had no detectable nutrients in the water. This at first seemed odd, since the amount of nuisance algae should increase as the nutrients in the water increased. How could there be a very large amount of nuisance algae, but no measurable nutrients in the water to support this? Biologists then began pointing out that when the amount of nuisance algae became large enough, the algae actually consumed all the available nutrients from the water faster than new nutrients were added. Dr. Adey's principles were at work again.

Interest in using algae for nutrient control once again increased, this time in the form of keeping the algae in a "sump" or other small aquarium which was connected to the main aquarium via plumbing. With added lighting and flow, algae would grow in this area, and the algae would consume nutrients from the water just as Dr. Adey's algae scrubber units did. Sumps or other small aquariums used for this purpose became known as "refugiums".&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=broXAQAAIAAJ&amp;q=inauthor:%22Anthony+Calfo%22&amp;dq=inauthor:%22Anthony+Calfo%22&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=DHSBTaCSLYbCsAO0_sjrAQ&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=1&amp;ved=0CCgQ6AEwAA Reef Invertebrates, 2003, page 46]&lt;/ref&gt; The name "refugium" was used because the growing algae provided a safe place for small and microscopic animals to breed and grow, and thus was a "refuge" from the large fish and invertebrates in the main aquarium that would otherwise consume them. However while the refugiums did indeed consume nutrients from the water, they did not consume them fast enough in all situations; this caused many hobbyists to continue to have nuisance algae problems in their main aquariums.

== Modern forms ==
[[File:OriginalVerticalScrubberDesign.jpg|left|border|thumb|Original vertical scrubber design]]
More recent variations are built with a simple "waterfall" driven by [[gravity]], using a simple PVC plumbing pipe to flow water down a piece of plastic [[knitting]] screen (also known as "plastic canvas"), which is roughed up to allow algae to attach. In almost every case, these homemade algae scrubbers reduced the nutrients to very low levels, and this reduced or eliminated all nuisance algae problems.

{{Double image|right|BrownTurf.jpg|150|GreenHairAlgae.jpg|150|Undesirable brown (''left''), and desirable green (''right'') algae}}

In addition, "turf" algae, which was the focus of Dr. Adey's dumping-bucket design, is replaced by "green hair algae".&lt;ref name=algaescrubbernet&gt;[http://algaescrubber.net AlgaeScrubber.Net]&lt;/ref&gt; This is because turf algae tends to be dark brown and thick (like [[artificial turf]] on sports fields), and it blocks the light and water from reaching the screen. This slows the growth (and filtering) of the algae because the bottom layers of algae that are attached to the screen start to die and detach. Green algae, however (especially light-green hair algae), allows light and water to penetrate all the way down to the screen if the growth is kept less than 20&amp;nbsp;mm thick,&lt;ref&gt;Production within dense mats of the filamentous macroalga Chaetomorpha linum in relation to light and nutrient [http://www.int-res.com/articles/meps/134/m134p207.pdf availability], figure 5.  http://www.int-res.com/articles/meps/134/m134p207.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; which allows the algae to grow faster and absorb more nutrients without dying and losing attachment to the screen. This is fortunate because green hair algae is the exact type of algae that grows automatically in a properly constructed algae scrubber.

Some models also use up-flowing air bubbles. This version, which is basically the exact opposite of the waterfall, allows the algae scrubber to be placed underwater in the aquarium, sump or pond, instead of above it. This greatly simplifies construction, since the device does not need to be waterproof, and it allows placement of the scrubber into tight areas where there is no room above the water line. The design also keeps the algae from drying out in the event of a power failure, because all the algae is under water, and the design also removes almost all splashing. The up-flowing bubble design falls into three categories: those that attach to and shine through the aquarium (or sump) glass; those that float on top of the aquarium, sump or pond water surface; and those that go completely underwater like a submarine.

===Cleaning and harvesting===

Generally, and except for specific continuous-filtering or continuous-cultivating versions, algae scrubbers require the algae to be removed ("harvested") periodically from the scrubber. This removal of algae has the effect of removing undesired nutrients from the water because the algae used the nutrients in order to grow. The algae is generally removed either:

*Every 7 to 21 days, or 
*When it is black, or 
*When it fills up the scrubber, or 
*When it starts letting go, or
*When nutrients start to rise in the water.

For waterfall versions, the screen is removed from the pipe and cleaned in a sink with running water. The pipe is removed also, and the slot is cleaned with a toothbrush, to remove any algae that have grown up into it. After the algae are removed, the screen and pipe are put back in the scrubber. For upflow versions, the cleaning method depends on the type:

Glass-attached version: The magnet portion outside the glass is removed, and the inside portion is lifted out of the water. If the growth is thick green hair algae, then it is just removed by hand. If the growth is thin green hair (as occurs in freshwater) or dark slime, then the inside unit is taken to the sink and cleaned with a toothbrush. After cleaning, the inside and outside parts are put back into place on the glass.

Floating-surface version: If the growth is thick green hair algae then it is just removed by hand by lifting the LED lid up and pulling the growth out. If the growth is thin green hair or dark slime, then the floating portion is taken to the sink and cleaned with a toothbrush.

Drop-in version: The entire unit is lifted out of the water, and the lid is removed. If the growth is thick green hair algae then it is just removed by hand. If the growth is thin green hair or dark slime, then the whole unit is taken to the sink and cleaned with a toothbrush.

If the screen is not cleaned like this periodically, the algae will get too thick and block light and flow from reaching the "roots" of the algae, and these areas will die and let go, putting nutrients back into the water.&lt;ref name="algaescrubbernet" /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5008">The '''Antarctic Cold Reversal''' ('''ACR''') was an important episode of cooling in the [[climate]] history of the Earth during the [[deglaciation]] at the close of the last [[ice age]]. It illustrates the complexity of the climate changes at the transition from the [[Pleistocene]] to the [[Holocene]] Epochs.

The [[Last Glacial Maximum]] and sea-level minimum occurred c. 21,000 years before present ([[Before Present|BP]]). Antarctic ice cores show gradual warming beginning 3000 years later. At about 14,700 BP, there was a large pulse of meltwater, identified as [[Meltwater pulse 1A]],&lt;ref&gt;The output of Meltwater pulse 1A has been calculated at 1,000,000 L/s.&lt;/ref&gt; probably from either the [[Antarctic ice sheet]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | author = Weber | author2 = Clark | author3 = Kuhn | author4 = Timmermann | title = Millennial-scale variability in Antarctic ice-sheet discharge during the last deglaciation | journal = Nature | volume = 510 | issue = 7503 | pages = 134–138 | publisher = Nature Publishing Group | date = 5 June 2014 | url = http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v510/n7503/full/nature13397.html | doi = 10.1038/nature13397 |bibcode = 2014Natur.510..134W | pmid=24870232}}&lt;/ref&gt; or the [[Laurentide ice sheet]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last = Gregoire | first = Lauren | title = Deglacial rapid sea level rises caused by ice-sheet saddle collapses | journal = Nature | volume = 487 | issue = 7406 | pages = 219–222 | publisher = Nature Publishing Group | date = 11 July 2012 | url = http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v487/n7406/full/nature11257.html | doi = 10.1038/nature11257 | bibcode = 2012Natur.487..219G | pmid=22785319}}&lt;/ref&gt; Meltwater pulse 1A produced a [[sea-level rise|marine transgression]] that raised global sea level about 20 meters in two to five centuries and is thought to have influenced the start of the [[Bølling Oscillation|Bølling]]/[[Allerød Oscillation|Allerød interstadial]], the major break with glacial cold in the Northern Hemisphere. Meltwater pulse 1A was followed in [[Antarctica]] and the [[Southern Hemisphere]] by a renewed cooling, the Antarctic Cold Reversal, in c. 14,500 BP,&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Oldfield|2005|pp=97; see also pp. 98–107}}.&lt;/ref&gt; which lasted for two millennia &amp;mdash; an instance of warming causing cooling.&lt;ref&gt;For a similar warming/cooling instance, see [[8.2 kiloyear event]].&lt;/ref&gt; The ACR brought an average cooling of perhaps 3&amp;nbsp;°C. The [[Younger Dryas]] cooling, in the Northern Hemisphere, began while the Antarctic Cold Reversal was still ongoing, and the ACR ended in the midst of the Younger Dryas.&lt;ref&gt;Blunier, Thomas; ''et al.'', "Phase Lag of Antarctic and Greenland Temperature in the last Glacial...," in {{Harvnb|Abrantes|Mix|1999|pp=121–138}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

This pattern of climate decoupling between the Northern and Southern Hemispheres and of "southern lead, northern lag" would manifest in subsequent climate events. The cause or causes of this hemispheric decoupling, of the "lead/lag" pattern and of the specific mechanisms of the warming and cooling trends are still subjects of study and dispute among climate researchers. The specific dating and intensity of the Antarctic Cold Reversal are also under debate.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Cronin|2005|pp=209–210, 458–459}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

The onset of the Antarctic Cold Reversal was followed, after about 800 years, by an Oceanic Cold Reversal in the [[Southern Ocean]].

{{italic title}}'''''Arts &amp; Architecture''''' (1929–1967) was an [[United States|American]] [[design]], [[architecture]], [[landscape]], and [[arts]] [[magazine]]. It was published and edited by [[John Entenza]] from 1938–1962&lt;ref name="Votolato54"&gt;{{Citation|last=Votolato |first=Gregory|title=American Design in the Twentieth Century: Personality and Performance |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=EwOcmmnxKbwC&amp;pg=PA54&amp;lpg=PA54&amp;dq=%22Arts+%26+Architecture%22+magazine&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=bLLL6r-zu_&amp;sig=_Tr3oaSBfIldO7xPFZpgWOtA-XI&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=yzIMVJSJNcvSaNmVgng&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q=%22Arts%20%26%20Architecture%22%20magazine&amp;f=false |place= |publisher=[[Manchester University Press]] |pages=54 |year=1998|isbn=0-7190-4530-4 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and David Travers 1962–1967. ''Arts &amp; Architecture'' played a significant role both in [[Los Angeles]]'s cultural history and in the development of [[West Coast of the United States|West Coast modernism]] in general.&lt;ref name="Votolato54" /&gt; The magazine's significant cultural contributions include its sponsorship of the [[Case Study Houses]] design-build-publication program.

==History==
''Arts &amp; Architecture'' (1940–1967), an American architecture magazine, began as ''California Arts &amp; Architecture'' in 1929. It was redesigned under the leadership of Mark Daniels in 1936, and in 1940, John Entenza became publisher and editor; his views and leadership "put California on the cultural map",&lt;ref name="Votolato54"/&gt; creating a lasting impact on the cultural history of [[Los Angeles]], [[Southern California]], the [[West Coast of the United States|West Coast]], and the [[United States]] in the development of [[American modernism]]. According to ''American Design in the Twentieth Century'', ''Arts &amp; Architecture'' "treated taste as a subject of critical debate and maintained a high-minded concern for the elevation of standards".&lt;ref name="Votolato54" /&gt; When looking for examples of overseas art and design, the magazine looked to [[Mexico]] rather than Europe.&lt;ref name="Votolato54" /&gt; In 1962 Entenza resigned to direct the Graham Foundation, and the magazine was edited by David Travers until its closing in 1967.  It was revived 1981-1985 under the editorship of Barbara Goldstein.

==Designers published==
''Arts &amp; Architecture'' was the first American magazine to popularize the work of [[Hans Hofmann]], [[Craig Ellwood]], [[Raphael Soriano]], Margaret DePatta, [[George Nakashima]], [[Bernard Rosenthal]], [[Charles Eames]], [[Ray Eames]], [[Thomas Dolliver Church|Thomas Church]], [[Garrett Eckbo]], [[Lloyd Wright]], [[Konrad Wachsmann]], [[Robert Royston]], [[Hans Hollein]], [[Frank Gehry]] and many others. It also embodied the highest standard of [[graphic design]] attained by an American art magazine of its time, employing the talents of such designers as [[Alvin Lustig]], [[Herbert Matter]], John Follis, and photographer [[Julius Shulman]]. The magazine featured articles by writers such as architectural historian [[Esther McCoy]], [[Edgar Kaufmann, Jr.]], [[Walter Gropius]], [[Lewis Mumford]] and many more that were deeply involved in the modern movement.

==Reprints==
Book publisher [[Taschen]][http://www.taschen.com/pages/en/catalogue/architecture/all/03888/facts.arts_architecture_1945_54_the_complete_reprint.htm Taschen A&amp;A] has published a facsimile of all issues of the monthly magazine from 1945 to 1954 with an introduction by David Travers. Publication of issues 1955 to 1967 is planned.

'''Auxiliary power''' is [[electric power]] that is provided by an alternate source and that serves as backup for the [[primary power]] source at the station main [[Busbar|bus]] or prescribed sub-bus.

An offline unit provides electrical isolation between the primary power source and the [[critical technical load]] whereas an online unit does not.

A Class A power source is a primary power source, i.e., a source that assures an essentially continuous supply of power.

Types of auxiliary power services include Class B, a standby power [[power station|plant]] to cover extended outages of the order of days; Class C, a 10-to-60-second quick-start unit to cover short-term outages of the order of hours; and Class D, an uninterruptible non-break unit using stored energy to provide continuous power within specified voltage and [[frequency]] tolerances.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10632">'''Baptism of desire''' ({{lang-la|Baptismus flaminis}}) is a teaching of the [[Anglican Communion]], [[Lutheran Church]] and [[Roman Catholic Church]] explaining that those who desire [[baptism]], but are not baptized with water through the [[Christian]] Sacrament because of death, nevertheless receive the fruits of Baptism at the moment of death if their grace of conversion included "divine and catholic faith", an internal act of perfect charity, and [[perfect contrition]] by which their soul was cleansed of all sin. Hence, the [[Catechism of the Catholic Church]] observes, "For [[catechumen]]s [those instructed in the Catholic faith who are preparing to be baptized into the Catholic Church] who die before their Baptism, their explicit desire to receive it, together with repentance for their sins, and charity, assures them the salvation that they were not able to receive through the sacrament" (CCC 1259).

The ''Baptism of Blood'' is a similar idea, for unbaptized martyrs.

==Denominational positions==
{{further|Fate of the unlearned|Anonymous Christian|Virtuous pagan}}
===Roman Catholicism===
The Catholic Church teaches that "baptism is necessary for [[salvation]]." (''[[Catechism of the Catholic Church]]'', ss. 1257).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.vatican.va/archive/catechism_lt/p2s2c1a1_lt.htm#ARTICULUS%201%A0%20SACRAMENTUM%20BAPTISMI |title= Sacramentum Baptismi |language= Latin |work=Catechismus Catholicae Ecclesiae |publisher=Vatican: the Holy See |accessdate=9 April 2011| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20110510023309/http://www.vatican.va/archive/catechism_lt/p2s2c1a1_lt.htm| archivedate= 10 May 2011 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;   It moreover teaches that baptism confers the forgiveness of [[sin]]s by virtue of the enactment of the [[sacrament]] itself: "(b)y Baptism all sins are forgiven, [[original sin]] and all personal sins, as well as all punishment for sin." (ss. 1263).  For Catholics, baptism is a unique, unrepeatable act; no one who has been baptized validly can receive the full pardon conferred by the sacrament a second time. (ss. 1272)  Given these doctrines, it is a matter of serious concern for the Catholic Church if a believing Christian does not receive a valid baptism.

The doctrine of baptism of desire seeks to address some of the implications of these teachings.  It holds that those who, as adults, come to faith in Christ and become catechumens but who die before receiving baptism nevertheless are admitted to Justification even though the Church teaches that baptism is necessary for salvation.

[[Doctor of the Church]], the Venerable [[Bede]]'s 731 [[Ecclesiastical History of the English People]] states of [[Saint Alban]], who substituted himself and was martyred as a new convert, that though he was not washed with the water of baptism, he was cleansed by the washing with his blood.

The Catholic 1582 Rheims New Testament, the first published tome of the [[Douay-Rheims Bible]], specifically notes in its annotations to John 3:5 both the necessity of Baptism and the availability of Baptism of Desire and Baptism of Blood.  The Catholic Church had been expelled from England at the time of the production of the Bible and many annotations were designed to assist lay Catholics to keep to their faith in the absence of clergy.

===Eastern Orthodoxy===
Among [[Eastern Orthodox]] Christians, the basic doctrine of baptism of desire is accepted, although it is not so rigorously defined.{{citation-needed|date=July 2017}}

===Protestantism===
Both the [[Augsburg Confession]] of [[Lutheranism]] and the [[Book of Common Prayer]] of [[Anglicanism]] affirm that "Baptism is normally necessary for salvation" in accordance with Sacred Scripture: {{Bibleverse|Matthew|28:19|KJV}}, {{Bibleverse|Mark|16:16|KJV}}, {{Bibleverse|John|3:5|KJV}}, and {{Bibleverse|Acts|2:38|KJV}}.&lt;ref name="Larson-MillerKnowles2013"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Larson-Miller|first1=Lizette|last2=Knowles|first2=Walter|title=Drenched in Grace: Essays in Baptismal Ecclesiology Inspired by the Work and Ministry of Louis Weil|date=26 June 2013|publisher=Wipf and Stock Publishers|language=English |isbn=9781621897538|page=55}}&lt;/ref&gt; Citing the teaching of the [[early Church Fathers]], Lutherans and Anglicans acknowledge a baptism of desire "where opportunity does not present itself" and a baptism of blood ([[Christian martyr|martyrdom]]) in "the circumstances of [[Persecution of Christians|persecution]]".&lt;ref name="Larson-MillerKnowles2013"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.anglicancatholic.org/sacraments-convey-grace?class=greenlink|title=The Sacraments Convey Grace|publisher=[[Anglican Catholic Church]]|language=English|accessdate=28 January 2017|quote=The Church from very early days, for instance, enrolled among the martyrs those catechumens (people preparing for baptism) who were killed during persecutions.  While the Fathers certainly view baptism as "generally necessary," the circumstances of persecution create an anamolous situation where the general rule cannot apply. The Fathers speak of such martyred catechumens as receiving the "baptism of blood," which certainly is adequate to wash away their sins.  The necessity for baptism presupposes opportunity.  Where opportunity does not present itself the Church accepts the "baptism of desire," the desire to be baptized, for the fact of baptism.  Our Lord suggests as much:  "He that believeth and is baptized shall be saved; but he that believeth not shall be damned.' (Mk 16:16, again.)  Note that Christ does not say, `He that is not baptized shall be damned.' Nevertheless, it is never safe to suppose that a mental, subjective state of faith in Christ can replace the objectively effective sacrament established and commanded (Mt 28:19) by him.  A positive refusal to seek baptism at the first opportunity argues that what seems to be faith is no such thing.  Faith properly leads, not to a minimal, grudging participation in the sacramental life of the Church, but to the fullness of such participation, with all of its sacraments, acts of piety and worship, and opportunities for service and growth in faith, hope, and love.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The question of baptism of desire often does not arise among Baptists, because their underlying [[theology]] of baptism is different. For them, baptism is an [[Ordinance (Christian)|ordinance]] undertaken in obedience to the teaching of [[Jesus]] and to follow the example he set.  The rite of baptism, however, in their view does not confer forgiveness of sins by its performance, nor is it thought to be necessary to salvation, which comes from [[sola fide|faith alone]] and is not contingent upon any ritual or form of words.  They point to passages such as [[Acts of the Apostles|Acts]] {{bibleverse-nb||Acts|10:44-48|KJV}}, in which various Gentiles who heard [[Saint Peter|Peter]] preaching were converted and received the [[Holy Spirit]] prior to baptism; if baptism were necessary for salvation, these people would not have believed and received the Holy Spirit, it is argued. Lutherans, Orthodox and Roman Catholics would respond that in verses 47-48, baptism was in fact necessary, even though they had received the Holy Spirit, as Peter said, "'Can any man forbid water, that these would not be baptized, which have received the Holy Ghost as well as we?'  And he commanded them to be baptized in the name of the Lord."

==Related theological views==
[[Karl Rahner]] taught a very inclusive view called [[anonymous Christian]], which holds that there may be an unlimited number of people who secretly long for Christ in spite of their non-Christian background. This view, which has influenced the official Church doctrine, is theologically close to [[Trinitarian universalism|Christian universalism]], the teaching that all may be saved by divine grace.

On the other hand, [[Leonard Feeney]] was a U.S. Jesuit priest who defended the strict interpretation of the Roman Catholic doctrine, [[extra Ecclesiam nulla salus]] ("outside The Church there is no salvation"), arguing that baptism of blood and baptism of desire are unavailing and that therefore no non-Catholics will be saved.  Feeney held to a strict reading of John 3:5, that being "born again" of water baptism is necessary for salvation.  Also, Feeney's position was that the love and providence of God would not permit a soul to die in such a state.  He held with Catholic tradition that the Apostles literally followed Christ's commands to preach to all nations, and he pointed to archaeological evidence that he said suggests the presence of Christians in the Americas in the first millennium, a view not supported by the archeological profession.  He argued, and gave examples from his own ministry to support it, that any non believer who was sincerely interested in Catholicism would be provided with a priest when the moment of death came.

Father Feeney was excommunicated "on account of grave disobedience to Church Authority, being unmoved by repeated warnings", however this excommunication was annulled in 1972 without significant recantation.&lt;ref&gt;[[Feeneyism]]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Christian martyrdom==
[[File:Jean-Léon Gérôme - The Christian Martyrs' Last Prayer - Walters 37113.jpg|thumb|right|''The Christian Martyrs' Last Prayer'', by [[Jean-Léon Gérôme]] (1883)]]
Similarly, those who die as [[Christian martyr]]s in a [[persecution of Christians]] are also judged by Anabaptists,&lt;ref name="Hill2015"&gt;{{cite book|last=Hill|first=Kat|title=Baptism, Brotherhood, and Belief in Reformation Germany: Anabaptism and Lutheranism, 1525-1585|year=2015|publisher=Oxford University Press|language=English|isbn=9780198733546|page=134}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lutherans,&lt;ref name="Hill2015"/&gt; Roman Catholic and Anglicans to have acquired the benefits of baptism without actually undergoing the ritual; this is the "baptism of blood" (''baptismum sanguinis'') (ss. 1258).  Because the Anglican Communion, Catholic Church and Lutheran Church practice [[infant baptism]], these issues seldom arise except for adult converts to the Church who were not baptized as children.  The Catholic Church officially professes uncertainty about the fate in the afterlife of infants who die before baptism, observing that "the Church can only entrust them to the mercy of God" (ss. 1261). One theory is that these infant souls exist in a natural state of supreme happiness, called [[Limbo]], although deprived eternally of the [[beatific vision|vision of God]].

'''Challenging Minisatellite Payload''' (CHAMP) was a [[Germany|German]] [[satellite]] launched July 15, 2000 from [[Plesetsk Cosmodrome|Plesetsk]], Russia and was used for [[Earth's atmosphere|atmospheric]] and [[ionospheric]] research, as well as other [[geoscience|geoscientific]] applications, such as [[GPS radio occultation]].

CHAMP was managed by [[:de:Deutsches GeoForschungsZentrum|GeoForschungsZentrum (GFZ)]] [[Potsdam]] (GFZ).

The spacecraft is the first application of Astrium's "Flexbus" platform; [[Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment|GRACE]] was the second.  A heavily modified version flew as the [[GOCE]] mission.

CHAMP completed its mission and re-entered the Earth's atmosphere on 19 September 2010 after 10 years (design life: five years).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://reentrynews.aero.org/2000039b.html |title=Upcoming and Recent Reentries &amp;#124; The Aerospace Corporation |publisher=Reentrynews.aero.org |date= |accessdate=2013-08-01 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120513035841/http://reentrynews.aero.org/2000039b.html |archive-date=2012-05-13 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The mission was judged as being successful by the involved scientists.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gfz-potsdam.de/portal/gfz/Public+Relations/Pressemitteilungen/aktuell/100920_PM_CHAMP-End?template=gfz] {{dead link|date=August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2968">'''Color–flavor locking (CFL)''' is a phenomenon that is expected to occur in ultra-high-density [[strange matter]], a form of [[quark matter]]. The quarks form [[Cooper pair]]s, whose [[color charge|color]] properties are correlated with their [[flavour (particle physics)|flavor]] properties in a [[one-to-one correspondence]] between three color pairs and three flavor pairs. According to the [[Standard Model]] of particle physics, the color-flavor-locked phase is the highest-density phase of three-flavor colored matter.&lt;ref&gt;

==Color-flavor-locked Cooper pairing==

If each quark is represented as &lt;math&gt;\psi^\alpha_i&lt;/math&gt;, with color index &lt;math&gt;\alpha&lt;/math&gt; taking values 1, 2, 3 corresponding to red, green, and blue, and flavor index &lt;math&gt;i&lt;/math&gt; taking values 1, 2, 3 corresponding to [[up quark|up]], [[down quark|down]], and [[strange quark|strange]], then the color-flavor-locked pattern of Cooper pairing is &lt;ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\langle \psi^\alpha_i C \gamma_5 \psi^\beta_j \rangle
\propto \delta^\alpha_i\delta^\beta_j - \delta^\alpha_j\delta^\beta_i 
= \epsilon^{\alpha\beta A}\epsilon_{ij A} 
&lt;/math&gt;

This means that a Cooper pair of an up quark and a down quark must have colors red and green, and so on. This pairing pattern is special because it leaves a large unbroken{{clarify|date=November 2012|there is no such thing as u–d–c SU(3) symmetry: these flavors have different *physical* properties (namely, mass, electric charge and weak interaction)}} symmetry group.

==Physical properties==

The CFL phase has several remarkable properties.
* It breaks [[chiral symmetry]].
* It is a [[superfluid]].
* It is an electromagnetic [[Insulator (electrical)|insulator]], in which there is a "rotated" [[photon]], containing a small [[quantum superposition|admixture]] of one of the [[gluon]]s.
* It has the same symmetries as sufficiently dense [[hyperon]]ic matter.

There are several variants of the CFL phase, representing distortions of the pairing structure in response to external stresses such as a difference between the mass of the strange quark and the mass of the up and down quarks.

'''Cultural sustainability''' as it relates to [[sustainable development]] (to [[sustainability]]), has to do with the maintaining of cultural beliefs, [[cultural practice]]s, [[Historic preservation|heritage conservation]], culture as its own entity, and attempts to answer the question of whether or not any given cultures will exist in the context of the future.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Soini|first=Katriina|last2=Birkland|first2=Inger|year=2014|title=Exploring the scientific discourse on cultural sustainability|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com.subzero.lib.uoguelph.ca/science/article/pii/S0016718513002558|journal=Geoforum|volume=51|pages=213–223|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Culture is defined as a set of beliefs, morals, methods, and a collection of human knowledge that is dependent on the transmission of these characteristics to younger generations.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/culture|title=Definition of CULTURE|website=www.merriam-webster.com|language=en|access-date=2017-03-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sustainability is defined as the ability to sustain or continue.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/sustainable|title=Definition of SUSTAINABLE|website=www.merriam-webster.com|language=en|access-date=2017-03-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; The two concepts have been intertwined within social and political domains, and as such, have become one of the more important concepts of [[sustainability]].

First mentioned in 1995, cultural sustainability also presents viable options within the realm of social policy, providing solutions to sustainable development issues.

Cultural Sustainability can be regarded as a fundamental issue, even a precondition to be met on the path towards sustainable development. However, the theoretical and conceptual understanding of cultural sustainability within the general frames of Sustainable Development remains vague and consequently, the role of culture is poorly implemented in the environmental, as well as political and social policy. Determining the impact of Cultural Sustainability is found by investigating the concept of culture in the context of Sustainable development, through multidisciplinary approaches and analyses. This means examining the best practices for bringing culture into political and social policy as well as practical domains, and developing means and indicators for assessing the impacts of culture on Sustainable Development.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

Cultural sustainability has always been categorized under the social pillar of the three pillars of sustainability, but with recent developments within this field considerations are being made in order to make Cultural Sustainability its own pillar, due to its growing importance within social, political, environmental, and economic spheres.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The importance of cultural sustainability lies within its influential power over the people, as decisions that are made within the context of society are heavily weighed by the beliefs of that society.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Bender|first=Oliver|last2=Haller|first2=Andreas|year=2017|title=The cultural embeddedness of population mobility in the Alps: Consequences for sustainable development|url=https://doi.org/10.1080/00291951.2017.1317661|journal=Norsk Geografisk Tidsskrift - Norwegian Journal of Geography|volume=71|pages=132–145|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Socio-political landscapes ==
Culture has an overwhelming effect on social, economic and political planning, but as of yet, has failed to be incorporated into social and political policy on a grand scale,&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Axelsson|first=Robert|last2=Angelstam|first2=Per|last3=Degerman|first3=Erik|last4=Teitelbaum|first4=Sara|last5=Andersson|first5=Kjell|last6=Elbakidze|first6=Marine|last7=Drotz|first7=Marcus K.|date=2013-03-01|title=Social and Cultural Sustainability: Criteria, Indicators, Verifier Variables for Measurement and Maps for Visualization to Support Planning|url=https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s13280-012-0376-0|journal=AMBIO|language=en|volume=42|issue=2|pages=215–228|doi=10.1007/s13280-012-0376-0|issn=0044-7447|pmc=3593035|pmid=23475657}}&lt;/ref&gt; however, certain policies regarding both policy and politics have managed to be implemented into some conventions that are implemented on a global scale.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; Culture is found everywhere within a society, from the relics of previous generations, to the accumulated values of a society.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; Culture within society can be divided into two, equally important subtopics that aid in the description of cultural specific characterizations. These categories, as defined by the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization ([[UNESCO]]) are "Material" and "Immaterial".&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; Material objects such as shrines, paintings, buildings, landscapes and other humanistic formations act as a physical representation of the culture in that area.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; Although they have little social and political utility, they serve as physical landmarks and culturally dependant objects whose meaning is created and maintained within the context of that society.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The accumulation of these cultural characteristics are what measures a society's cultural integrity, and these characteristics are inherently capable of transforming landscapes of political, social, &amp; environment nature via the influence that these values and historical remains have on the population.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; Little success has come with the implementations of cultural policy within the context of politics due to a lack of empirical information regarding the topic of cultural sustainability.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; The Immaterial category contains more socially and politically applicable characteristics such as practices, traditions, aesthetics, knowledge, expressions etc.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Chiu|first=Rebecca|year=2004|title=Socio-Cultural Sustainability of Housing: a Conceptual Exploration|url=http://journals2.scholarsportal.info.subzero.lib.uoguelph.ca/pdf/14036096/v21i0002/65_ssohace.xml|journal=Housing, Theory and Society|volume=21|pages=65–76|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; These characteristics embody social and political utility through education of people, housing, [[social justice]], [[Human rights|Human Rights]], employment and more.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; These values contribute to the wellbeing of a society through the use of collective thinking and ideals i.e. culture. Culture also presents more room for expansion on its effects on a society. Specifically, creativity, respect, empathy, and other practices are being used to create social integration and also to create a sense of "self" in the world.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

=== Convention implementation ===
[[File:UNESCO logo.svg|left|295x295px]]
Implementation of policy on a global scale has had little success, but enough to show an increasing interest in the topic of Cultural Sustainability. The conventions that have been implemented, have done so on a large scale, involving multiple countries, across most continents. UNESCO has been responsible for the vast majority of these conventions, maintaining that cultural sustainability and cultural heritage are a strong cornerstone of society.&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.unesco.org/culture/ich/en/convention|title=Text of the Convention for the Safeguarding of the Intangible Cultural Heritage - intangible heritage - Culture Sector - UNESCO|website=www.unesco.org|language=en|access-date=2017-03-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; One of the more relevant conventions created in 2003 is the "Convention for the Safeguarding of the Intangible Cultural Heritage" which proclaims that culture must be protected against all adversarial combatants.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; This safeguard was implemented as an understanding that culture guarantees sustainability. Implementing policy based on cultural history is in the process of becoming a widely talked about subject and holds that cultures will be able to thrive in the context of both present and future. Conventions made by UNESCO regarding cultural preservation and sustainability are surrounding the promotion of [[cultural diversity]], which means multiple cultures and ideals within one grand culture.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== Cultural heritage ==
Cultural memorabilia and artifacts from a cultures history maintain an important role in modern society as they are kept as relics and shrines in order to remember the stories, knowledge, skills and methods of ancestors and learn invaluable lessons from the past. Today, cultures use libraries, art exhibits and museums as a placeholder for these important objects and other culturally significant artifacts.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Loach|first=Kirsten|last2=Rowley|first2=Jennifer|last3=Griffiths|first3=Jillian|date=2017-03-04|title=Cultural sustainability as a strategy for the survival of museums and libraries|url=https://dx.doi.org/10.1080/10286632.2016.1184657|journal=International Journal of Cultural Policy|volume=23|issue=2|pages=186–198|doi=10.1080/10286632.2016.1184657|issn=1028-6632}}&lt;/ref&gt; Not only are these objects revered, but the buildings themselves are oftentimes a symbol of cultural integrity to the community which it belongs. Linking with the other pillars of sustainability, the biggest barrier to cultural sustainability is funding. Economic sustainability relies on a number of systems with goals to ensure economic prosperity by eliminating spending where it is not needed.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.international.gc.ca/development-developpement/priorities-priorites/segs-sced.aspx?lang=eng|title=Development Sustainable Economic Growth Strategy|last=Government of Canada|first=Foreign Affairs Trade and Development Canada|website=GAC|access-date=2017-03-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cultural buildings such as museums oftentimes fail to receive the funding it needs to continue the preservation of culturally significant artifacts.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

== Sustainable tourism ==
[[Tourism]] is a travelling method for which people can venture to different areas of the globe and experience new ways of living, and explore landscapes not native to their country of origin. Tourism is constantly being criticized for its impact on the social, political and environmental landscapes due to its high volume of mass consumers. Within the realm of tourism exists more sustainable practices and ideals that are aligned with the idea of cultural sustainability.

=== Geotourism ===
[[File:Forest view stairs in Thenmala 1.jpg|left|thumb]]
[[Geotourism]] is a form of tourism which relies heavily upon the sustainability, or even the improvement of a selected geological location.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Farsani|first=Neda Torabi|last2=Coelho|first2=Celeste|last3=Costa|first3=Carlos|year=2012|title=Geotourism and Geoparks as Gateways to Socio-cultural Sustainability in Qeshm Rural Areas, Iran|url=http://www.tandfonline.com.subzero.lib.uoguelph.ca/doi/abs/10.1080/10941665.2011.610145#aHR0cDovL3d3dy50YW5kZm9ubGluZS5jb20uc3ViemVyby5saWIudW9ndWVscGguY2EvZG9pL3BkZi8xMC4xMDgwLzEwOTQxNjY1LjIwMTEuNjEwMTQ1P25lZWRBY2Nlc3M9dHJ1ZUBAQDA=|journal=Asia Pacific Journal of Tourism Research|volume=17|pages=30–48|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Serving as an alternative to [[Mass tourism|Mass Tourism]], Geotourism was created with the purpose of aiding in the sustainable development movement. Geotourism is a method which focuses on Sustainable culture, ecological preservation and restoration, welfare of local populous, and the wildlife in the immediate area.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; The link between Geotourism and Cultural sustainability lies within their role in maintaining the natural state of the environment, including the social and cultural environment. Preservation of the local culture has been a key element of Geotourism from its inception, and due to this form of tourism, travellers are able to experience true local culture, lifestyles, and practices experienced by the people native to that region.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; This form of tourism provides education regarding destinations they have travelled to via ethnographic methods, and also calls upon the traveller to become aware of the footprint they leave on the environment, as well as social changes that may be harmful to the indigenous peoples.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Jamal|first=Tazim|last2=Camargo|first2=Blanca|last3=Sandlin|first3=Jennifer|last4=Segrado|first4=Romano|date=2010-01-01|title=Tourism and Cultural Sustainability: Towards an Eco-cultural Justice for Place and People|url=https://dx.doi.org/10.1080/02508281.2010.11081643|journal=Tourism Recreation Research|volume=35|issue=3|pages=269–279|doi=10.1080/02508281.2010.11081643|issn=0250-8281}}&lt;/ref&gt; Responsibility plays an important role in Geotourism by informing travellers of their duties to respect, and preserve the local culture.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Many countries have adapted this method of tourism, going as far as to implement geotourism sites equipped with guides that discuss matters of importance in that area such as environmental or cultural concerns.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Such countries include:&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; 
* Many states within the U.S.A. including California &amp; Arizona 
* Romania 
* Norway 
* Honduras 
Geotourism in Honduras includes The Bay Islands,  a Caribbean archipelago made up of three main islands, Utila, Roatan, and Guanaja and a few lesser islands and cays located off the north coast of Honduras. These islands have been blessed with stunning natural scenery, highlighted by idyllic beaches, tropical hillsides, and mangrove forests. &lt;ref&gt;https://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2004/10/1025_041025_travelwatch.html 
&lt;/ref&gt;
* Mexico 
Geotourism in Mexico includes Puerto Penasco. This region includes the protected Sea of Cortez, the Pinacate Crator which offers barren desesrts, sacred tribal and Indian lands, fishing zones, estuaries, oyster beds,  and vibrant farmland and wine country.&lt;ref&gt;http://geo-mexico.com/?p=12768 &lt;/ref&gt;
* Canada 
Geotourism in Canada includes Nova Scotia. It was visited by explorers and geologists from around the world for centuries, Nova Scotia′s geological sites are now recognized for their beauty as much as for their rich history. Nova Scotia’s sites include the iconic lighthouses, which is built on rocky precipices that reach out into the sea. &lt;ref&gt;http://press.nationalgeographic.com/2013/04/24/canadian-parks-wilderness-newfoundland-labrador-geotourism-mapguide/ &lt;/ref&gt;
* Portugal 
Geotourism in Portugal includes the Geopark of Arouca, which, in 2010, was officially recognised and joined the Global network of Geoparks, under the auspices of UNESCO. The park is known for it’s natural, gastronomical, and cultural heritage. This mountainous area, with rivers, natural parks, steep slopes and lush vegetation covers the entire municipality of Arouca.

As the practice of sustainability in all forms (environmental, social, and economy) becomes a more revered topic and gains traction within political spheres, sociologists suggest refining the practices of tourism to fit a mold that is more conducive to the sustainability models.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Tazim et al. suggests the key to sustainable tourism lies within the responsible practice of travellers, but also within the direct participation of the locals in tourism practices.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Although Geotourism shows to be a viable alternative for mass tourism, reducing the footprint of travellers on different parts of the world, there have been criticisms made regarding its fairness to the local population. Issues of fair pay, and the rights of the local people are the basis of the ethical dilemmas this kind of tourism faces. Tourism has a direct effect on the culture of the local populous, and as such, the focus of sociologists has been how to maintain the local environment (physically, socio-culturally, and economically) while at the same time, introduce people to a new culture.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2820">'''Electrical energy''' is energy derived from [[electric potential energy]] or [[kinetic energy]]. When loosely used to describe energy absorbed or maybe  delivered by an [[electrical circuit]] (for example, one provided by an [[electric power]] utility) "electrical energy" talks about energy which has been converted ''from'' electric potential energy. This energy is supplied by the combination of [[electric current]] and [[electric potential]] that is delivered by the circuit. At the point that this electric potential energy has been converted to another type of energy, it ceases to be electric potential energy. 
Thus, all electrical energy is potential energy before it is delivered to the end-use. Once converted from potential energy, electrical energy can always be called another type of energy (heat, light, motion, etc.).

== Electricity generation ==

{{Main|Electricity generation}}

'''Electricity generation''' is the process of generating electrical energy from other [[forms of energy]].

The fundamental principle of electricity generation was discovered during the 1820s and early 1830s by the British scientist [[Michael Faraday]].  His basic method is still used today: electricity is generated by the movement of a loop of wire, or [[Homopolar generator|disc of copper]] between the poles of a [[magnet]].&lt;ref name=Faraday_House&gt;{{cit
e web|title=Michael Faraday House|url=http://www.theiet.org/about/libarc/archives/biographies/faraday.cfm|website=The Institution of Engineering &amp; Technology|accessdate=8 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For electrical utilities, it is the first step in the delivery of electricity to consumers. The other processes, electricity [[Electric power transmission|transmission]], [[Electric power distribution|distribution]], and electrical power storage and recovery using [[Pumped-storage hydroelectricity|pumped-storage]] methods are normally carried out by the [[electric power industry]].&lt;ref name=IEC&gt;{{cite web|title=Keep the Power On|url=http://www.iec.ch/about/brochures/pdf/technology/IEC_https://en.wikipedia.org/w/Electrical%20Energy_Keep_the_power_on.pdf|website=IEC Electrical Energy|accessdate=8 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Electricity is most often generated at a [[power station]] by electromechanical [[electrical generator|generators]], primarily driven by [[heat engine]]s fueled by chemical [[combustion]] or [[nuclear fission]] but also by other means such as the [[kinetic energy]] of flowing water and wind. There are many other technologies that can be and are used to generate electricity such as solar [[photovoltaics]] and [[geothermal power]].

'''Energy in Europe''' includes [[World energy resources and consumption|energy]] and [[Electricity generation|electricity]] production, consumption and import in [[Europe]].

== Primary energy consumption by fuel ==

In the [[European Union]], the total primary energy consumption reached a peak in 2006 and decreased by 12 % since then&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.eea.europa.eu/data-and-maps/indicators/primary-energy-consumption-by-fuel-6/assessment-1 Primary energy consumption by fuel], [[European Environment Agency]], data from [[Eurostat]] (page visited on 11 November 2018).&lt;/ref&gt;:

===Renewable energy===
The twelve newer EU Member States in Central and Eastern Europe plan to increase wind power capacity from the 6.4 gigawatts installed at the end of 2012 to 16 gigawatts by 2020.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ewea.org/press-releases/detail/?tx_ttnews%5Btt_news%5D=2022&amp;cHash=8038d5b6fd3f880c51b099ae3f4e5f54 Wind power for 9 million households in Eastern Europe by 2020] 5 Feb 2013&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ewea.org/fileadmin/files/library/publications/reports/Eastern_Winds_emerging_markets.pdf Eastern winds, Emerging European wind power markets] February 2013&lt;/ref&gt;


If renewable electricity production in the EU continued to grow at the same rate as it did from 2005 to 2010, it would account for 36.4% of electricity in 2020 and 51.6% in 2030, following:&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ewea.org/index.php?id=60&amp;no_cache=1&amp;tx_ttnews%5Btt_news%5D=1928&amp;tx_ttnews%5BbackPid%5D=259&amp;cHash=5b6ef5175da4b4475793f542a20f3a80 EU met its 2010 Renewable electricity target - ambitious 2030 target needed] EWEA 12 January 2012&lt;/ref&gt;

He was also a Minister of the [[Methodist Church]].

==Biography==

Evens' mother was [[Romani people|Romani]], born in a ''[[Vardo (Romani wagon)|vardo]]'' (gypsy wagon). His father was [[Salvation Army]] Lieutenant George Evens, a native of [[Plymouth]]. He was born at 3 Argyll Street, Anlaby Road, Hull, England and educated at Epworth College, [[Rhyl]], as boarder, then at Queens College, [[Taunton]]. He married Eunice, the daughter of The Reverend Owen Thomas on 1 August 1911.&lt;ref name="RS-Notes" /&gt;

He is most famous for his ''Out with the Romany'' radio programmes (later ''Out with Romany''), which commenced in 1933 on the [[BBC]]'s [[Children's Hour]], describing travels in his own ''vardo'' (purchased in 1921, at Brough Hill Fair, for £75), with Comma the horse, his [[English Cocker Spaniel]], Raq, and his young friends Muriel and Doris.&lt;ref name="RS-Notes" /&gt; Although the programmes were all pre-scripted and performed entirely in the studio, the impression given was of Romany and his friends going for a walk in the countryside and spontaneously discussing the plants and animals they came across. [[Raphael Samuel]] saw the programme as instrumental in making the countryside desirable for a generation of listeners.&lt;ref&gt;R Samuel, ''Theatres of Memory Vol I'' (London 1994) p. 235&lt;/ref&gt; [[Simon Barnes]] has paid tribute to how his father (radio) and himself (books) were drawn to natural history by Romany: "I longed to walk through the country with the all-knowing, all-seeing Romany".&lt;ref&gt;S Barnes, ''How to be a Bad Birdwatcher'' (London 2004) p. 45&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:George Bramwell Evens - Romany - plaque at Carlisle.jpg|thumb|Plaque in Carlisle]]

As a Methodist minister, Evens' ministries included [[Goole]]; the Methodist Central Hall, [[Carlisle, Cumbria|Carlisle]] (1914–26); [[Huddersfield]] (1926–29); and the King Cross Methodist Chapel, [[Halifax, West Yorkshire|Halifax]] (1929–39), after which ill health forced him to give up the ministry. He retired to [[Wilmslow]], where he died, leaving his wife, son Glyn and daughter, Romany June.

His ashes were scattered, at his request, at Old Parks Farm, [[Glassonby]], Cumbria, which he had enjoyed visiting over a 22-year period: in 2001, a memorial to him was erected to him there by The Romany Society.&lt;ref&gt;Plaque at Old Parks Farm, see [https://www.flickr.com/photos/hollytree38/3476476204/ image on Flickr]&lt;/ref&gt; 

[[File:Romany's Vardo - geograph.org.uk - 130676.jpg|thumb|The vardo in Wilmslow in 2006]]

The vardo was donated, unconditionally, by his widow, to the forerunners of [[Cheshire East Council|Cheshire East Borough Council]] (CEBC). For many years it was displayed by CEBC, outdoors, in [[Wilmslow]]. In late 2012, having deteriorated badly, it was restored and moved to [[Bradford Industrial Museum]], to be displayed indoors.&lt;ref name="RM-2012"&gt;{{cite journal|year=2012|title=The Vardo|journal=Romany Magazine|publisher=The Romany Society|volume=17|page=22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''Romany Society'', originally formed in 1943, disbanded in 1965, and re-founded in 1996, celebrates his life and work, with regular newsletters and an annual magazine. Its patron is [[Terry Waite]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.romanysociety.org.uk/romanyhtml/romanyindex.html|title=Welcome to the Romany Society website|publisher=The Romany Society|accessdate=12 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The BBC radio programmes were all broadcast live, and only one recording survives – dated October 1943, just a month before his death. It was released on CD in 2006.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.valleystream.co.uk/romany-bbc.htm|work=Valley Stream Productions website|title=Romany of the BBC|accessdate=4 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4174">In [[Norse mythology]], '''Hvergelmir''' ([[Old Norse]] "bubbling boiling spring"&lt;ref name="ORCHARD-93"&gt;Orchard (1997:93)&lt;/ref&gt;) is a major spring. Hvergelmir is attested in the ''[[Poetic Edda]]'', compiled in the 13th century from earlier traditional sources, and the ''[[Prose Edda]]'', written in the 13th century by [[Snorri Sturluson]]. In the ''Poetic Edda'', Hvergelmir is mentioned in a single stanza, which details that it is the location where liquid from the antlers of the stag [[Eikþyrnir]] flow, and that the spring, "whence all waters rise", is the source of numerous rivers.&lt;ref name="THORPE-23"&gt;Thorpe (1866:23).&lt;/ref&gt; The ''Prose Edda'' repeats this information and adds that the spring is located in [[Niflheim]], that it is one of the three major springs at the primary roots of the cosmic tree [[Yggdrasil]] (the other two are [[Urðarbrunnr]] and [[Mímisbrunnr]]), and that within the spring are a vast amount of snakes and the dragon [[Níðhöggr]].

==Attestations==
Hvergelmir is attested in the following works:

===''Poetic Edda''===
Hvergelmir receives a single mention in the ''Poetic Edda'', found in the poem ''Grímnismál'':
{|
|
:Eikthyrnir the hart is called,
:that stands o'er Odin's hall,
:and bites from Lærad's branches;
:from his horns fall drops into Hvergelmir,
:whence all waters rise:&lt;ref name="THORPE-23"/&gt;
|
|}
This stanza is followed by three stanzas consisting mainly of the names of 42 rivers. Some of these rivers lead to the dwelling of the gods (such as [[Gömul]] and [[Geirvimul]]), while at least two ([[Gjöll]] and [[Leipt]]), reach to [[Hel (location)|Hel]].&lt;ref name="THORPE-23"/&gt;

===''Prose Edda''===
Hvergelmir is mentioned several times in the ''Prose Edda''. In ''[[Gylfaginning]]'', [[High, Just-As-High, and Third|Just-as-High]] explains that the spring Hvergelmir is located in the foggy realm of [[Niflheim]]: "It was many ages before the earth was created that Niflheim was made, and in its midst lies a spring called Hvergelmir, and from it flows the rivers called Svol, Gunnthra, Fiorm, Fimbulthul, Slidr and Hrid, Sylg and Ylg, Vid, Leiptr; Gioll is next to Hell-gates."&lt;ref name="FAULKES- 9-10"&gt;Faulkes (1995:9-10).&lt;/ref&gt;

Later in ''Gylfaginning'', Just-as-High describes the central tree Yggdrasil. Just-as-High says that three roots of the tree support it and "extend very, very far" and that the third of these three roots extends over Niflheim. Beneath this root, says Just-as-High, is the spring Hvergelmir, and that the base of the root is gnawed on by the dragon [[Níðhöggr]].&lt;ref name="FAULKES-17"&gt;Faulkes (1995:17).&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, High says that Hvergelmir contains not only Níðhöggr but also so many snakes that "no tongue can enumerate them".&lt;ref name="FAULKES-19"&gt;Faulkes (1995:19).&lt;/ref&gt;

The spring is mentioned a third time in  ''Gylfaginning'' where High recounts its source: the stag [[Eikþyrnir]] stands on top of the afterlife hall [[Valhalla]] feeding branches of [[Yggdrasil]], and from the stag's antlers drips great amounts of liquid down into Hvergelmir. High tallies 26 rivers here.&lt;ref name="FAULKES-33"&gt;Faulkes (1995:33).&lt;/ref&gt;

Hvergelmir is mentioned a final time in the ''Prose Edda'' where Third discusses the unpleasantries of [[Náströnd]]. Third notes that Hvergelmir yet worse than the venom-filled Náströnd because—by way of quoting a portion of a stanza from the ''Poetic Edda'' poem ''[[Völuspá]]''—"There Nidhogg torments the bodies of the dead".&lt;ref name="FAULKES-56"&gt;Faulkes (1995:56).&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Iapetus Ocean'''&lt;ref&gt;{{IPAc-en|aɪ|ˈ|æ|p|ɪ|t|ə|s}} {{cite web|url=http://phonetic-blog.blogspot.com/2010/04/iapetus-and-tonotopy.html|title=Iapetus and tonotopy|last=Wells|first=John|authorlink=John C. Wells|date=14 April 2010|accessdate=21 April 2010|work=John Wells's phonetic blog}}&lt;/ref&gt; was an [[ocean]] that existed in the late [[Neoproterozoic]] and early [[Paleozoic]] [[era]]s of the [[geologic timescale]] (between 600 and 400 million years ago). The Iapetus Ocean was situated in the [[southern hemisphere]], between the paleocontinents of [[Laurentia]], [[Baltica]] and [[Avalonia]]. The ocean disappeared with the [[Acadian orogeny|Acadian]], [[Caledonian orogeny|Caledonian]] and [[Taconic orogeny|Taconic]] [[orogeny|orogenies]], when these three continents joined to form one big landmass called [[Euramerica]]. The "southern" Iapetus Ocean has been proposed to have closed with the [[Famatinian orogeny|Famatinian]] and Taconic orogenies, meaning a collision between [[Gondwana|Western Gondwana]] and Laurentia.

Because the Iapetus Ocean was positioned between continental masses that would at a much later time roughly form the opposite shores of the [[Atlantic Ocean]], it can be seen as a sort of precursor of the Atlantic. The Iapetus Ocean was therefore named for the [[Titan (mythology)|titan]] [[Iapetus (mythology)|Iapetus]], who in [[Greek mythology]] was the father of [[Atlas (mythology)|Atlas]], after whom the Atlantic Ocean was named.{{efn-ua|The name Iapetus was first used by Harland &amp; Gayer (1972), before that the ocean was referred to as the ''Proto-Atlantic''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Banham |first1=P.H. |last2=Gibbs |first2=A.D.|last3=Hopper |first3=F.W.M. |date=1979 |title=Geological evidence in favour of a Jotunheimen Caledonian suture |url=http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v277/n5694/abs/277289a0.html?foxtrotcallback=true |journal=Nature |volume=277 |issue= |pages=289–291 |doi=10.1038/277289a0 |access-date= }}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

==Research history==
[[File:Geological fault at Niarbyl - geograph.org.uk - 107854.jpg|thumb|upright=1.35|Geological fault at [[Niarbyl]]. The narrow white diagonal line near centre of picture is the only known remaining  visible indication of the Iapetus Ocean]]
At the start of the 20th century, American paleontologist [[Charles Doolittle Walcott|Charles Walcott]] noticed differences in early Paleozoic [[benthic zone|benthic]] [[trilobite]]s of [[Laurentia]] (such as [[Olenellidae]], the so-called "Pacific fauna"), as found in [[Scotland]] and western [[Newfoundland and Labrador|Newfoundland]] and those of Baltica (such as [[Paradoxididae]], often called the "Atlantic fauna"), as found in the southern parts of the [[British Isles]] and eastern Newfoundland. Geologists of the early 20th century presumed that a large trough, a so-called [[geosyncline]], had existed between Scotland and England in the early Paleozoic, keeping both sides separated.&lt;ref name="Dalziel-1997"&gt;{{Harvnb|Dalziel|1997|loc=Review: "Archetypal" and "Alternative" Paleogeographic Scenarios, pp. 18–19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

With the development of [[plate tectonics]] in the 1960s, geologists such as [[Arthur Holmes]] and [[John Tuzo Wilson]] concluded that the Atlantic Ocean must have had a precursor before the time of [[Pangaea]]. Wilson also noticed that the Atlantic had opened at roughly the same place where its precursor ocean had closed. This led him to his [[Wilson cycle]] hypothesis.&lt;ref name="Dalziel-1997" /&gt;

==Geodynamic history==

===Neoproterozoic origin===
In many spots in Scandinavia [[basalt]]ic [[dike (geology)|dikes]] are found with ages between 670 and 650 million years. These are interpreted as evidence that by that time, [[rift]]ing had started that would form the Iapetus Ocean.&lt;ref name="Torsvik-etal-1996"&gt;{{Harvnb|Torsvik|Smethurst|Meert|Van der Voo|1996}}&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Newfoundland and Labrador]], the [[Long Range dikes]] are also thought to have formed during the formation of the Iapetus Ocean.&lt;ref&gt;[http://geology.geoscienceworld.org/cgi/content/abstract/17/7/602 Birthdate for the lapetus Ocean? A precise U-Pb zircon and baddeleyite age for the Long Range dikes, southeast Labrador]&lt;/ref&gt; It has been proposed that both the [[Fen Complex]] in Norway and the [[Alnö Complex]] in Sweden formed as consequence to mild [[extensional tectonics]] in the ancient continent of [[Baltica]] that followed the opening of the Iapetus Ocean.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Meert |first=Joseph G. |last2=Torsvik |first2=Trond H. |last3=Eide |first3=Elizabeth A. |last4=Dahlgren |first4=Sven |date=1998 |title=Tectonic Significance of the Fen Province, S.

The southern Iapetus Ocean opened between Laurentia and southwestern [[Gondwana]] (now South America) about 550 Ma in the [[Ediacaran]]–[[Cambrian]] transition. At the time it did so the [[Adamastor Ocean]] further east [[suture (geology)|closed]].&lt;ref name=Gaucheretal2010&gt;{{cite book |last=Gaucher |first=Claudio |last2=Frimmel |first2=Hartwig E. |last3=Germs |first3=J.B. |date=2010 |title=Neoproterozoic-cambrian tectonics, global change and evolution: a focus on south western Gondwana |editor-last=Gaucher |editor-first=Claudio |editor-last2=Sial |editor-first2=Alcides|editor-last3=Haverson |editor-first3=Galen |chapter=Tectonic Events and Palaeogeographic Evolution of Southwestern Gondwana in the Neoproterozoic and Cambrian|url= |location= |publisher=Elsevier |page=295–316 |isbn=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The opening of the Iapetus Ocean probably postdates the opening of the [[Puncoviscana Formation|Puncoviscana Ocean]] with the Iapetus Ocean being separated from the Puncoviscana Ocean by the ribbon-shaped [[Arequipa-Antofalla]] [[terrane]]. However, the formation of both oceans seems unrelated.&lt;ref name=escayolartal&gt;{{cite journal |last=Escayola P. |first=Mónica |last2=van Staal |first2=Cees R. |last3=Davis |first3=William J. |date=2011 |title=The age and tectonic setting of the Puncoviscana Formation in northwestern Argentina: An accretionary complex related to Early Cambrian closure of the Puncoviscana Ocean and accretion of the Arequipa-Antofalla block |url= |journal=[[Journal of South American Earth Sciences]] |publisher= |volume=32 |issue= |pages=438–459 |doi= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Paleozoic===

[[File:Iapetus fossil evidence EN.svg|thumb|right|upright=1.35|Position of the continents after the [[Caledonian orogeny]] ([[Devonian]] to [[Permian]] times). Differences in fossil faunas on both sides of the red line (the [[Iapetus Suture]]) are evidence for the existence of an ocean between the two sides in the time before the continents were joined in the [[supercontinent]] [[Pangaea]].
&lt;ref&gt;Figure based on Windley (1996) and Ziegler (1990)&lt;/ref&gt;]]

Southwest of the Iapetus, a volcanic [[island arc]] evolved from the early [[Cambrian]] (540&amp;nbsp;million years ago) onward. This volcanic arc was formed above a [[subduction zone]] where the [[oceanic lithosphere]] of the Iapetus Ocean subducted southward under other oceanic lithosphere. From Cambrian times (about 550 million years ago) the western Iapetus Ocean began to grow progressively narrower due to this subduction. The same happened further north and east, where Avalonia and Baltica began to move towards Laurentia from the [[Ordovician]] (488-444&amp;nbsp;million years ago) onward.&lt;ref name="Torsvik-etal-1996" /&gt;

[[Trilobite]] [[fauna]]s of the [[continental shelf|continental shelves]] of Baltica and Laurentia are still very different in the Ordovician, but [[Silurian]] faunas show progressive mixing of species from both sides, because the continents moved closer together.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Cocks|Fortey|1990}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the west, the Iapetus Ocean closed with the [[Taconic orogeny]] (480-430&amp;nbsp;million years ago), when the volcanic island arc [[continental collision|collided]] with Laurentia. Some authors consider the oceanic basin south of the island arc also a part of the Iapetus, this branch closed during the later [[Acadian orogeny]], when Avalonia collided with Laurentia.{{citation needed|date=September 2015}}

It has been suggested that the southern Iapetus Ocean closed during a [[continental collision]] between [[Laurentia]] and [[Gondwana|Western Gondwana]] (South America). If factual the [[Taconic orogeny|Taconic orogen]] would be the northward continuation of the [[Famatinian orogeny|Famatinian orogen]] exposed in Argentina.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Dalla Salda |first=Luis H.|last2=Dalziel |first2=Ian W.D.|last3=Cingolani |first3=Carlos A.|last4=Varela |first4=Ricardo |date=1992 |title=Did the Taconic Appalachians continue into southern South America? |url= |journal=[[Geology (journal)|Geology]] |publisher= |volume=20 |issue= |pages=1059–1062 |doi= 10.1130/0091-7613(1992)020&lt;1059:dttaci&gt;2.3.co;2}}&lt;!--|access-date=18 September 2015--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;{{efn-ua|In other words, what is at present the northern end of the Famatinian orogen would have been connected with what is currently the southern end of the Taconic orogen.}}

Meanwhile, the eastern parts had closed too: the [[Tornquist Sea]] between Avalonia and Baltica already during the late Ordovician,&lt;ref&gt;See Torsvik &amp; Rehnström (2003)&lt;/ref&gt; the main branch between Baltica-Avalonia and Laurentia during the [[Grampian phase|Grampian]] and [[Scandian phase]]s of the Caledonian orogeny (440-420&amp;nbsp;million years ago).{{citation needed|date=September 2015}}

At the end of the Silurian period (c. 420 million years ago) the Iapetus Ocean had completely disappeared and the combined mass of the three continents formed the "new" continent of [[Laurasia]],&lt;ref&gt;See for paleogeographic reconstructions of the collisions for example Stanley (1999), p. 386; Ziegler (1990), pp. 17-19&lt;/ref&gt; which would itself be the northern component of the singular supercontinent of [[Pangaea]].{{citation needed|date=September 2015}}

'''Jincang Lake''' (金仓湖，pinyin: JīnCāngHú)&amp;nbsp;is not a simple lake but an artificial [[wetland]] park completed in 2008 and located in [[Taicang]], in [[Suzhou]], China. It was a public project, and the government's total investment was up to 353&amp;nbsp;million. Thanks to the successful construction of Jincang Lake, people living in the city have a chance to get close to nature.

==Background to the project==
Suzhou is largely connected with water and peace. Within the Suzhou region, many districts have their own leisure entertainments. For example, [[Wuzhong District]], Wujiang city and [[Suzhou New District]] are sitting beside magnificent Taihu. As for the industrial district of Suzhou, it possesses an old pheasant lake. Then for [[Changshu]], the Shang Lake is equally splendid. Taicang has been a typical water city since ancient times, and with regard to economic development or modernization it is no less good than any other region in Suzhou. However, disappointingly, Taicang had no special public recreation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.forestry.gov.cn/portal/main/s/102/content-247999.html |title=江苏省太仓市金仓湖生态公园即将落成 |publisher=Forestry.gov.cn |date= |accessdate=2011-12-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2003, the government invested in constructing a new highway connecting Suzhou, [[Kunshan]] and Taicang. The soil was mainly taken from Donglin village in Taicang, so after the engineering work, a relatively large space was left, which eventually became the main lake in Jincang Lake.

With a long-standing wish to own a unique public recreation and an appropriate opportunity, the government approved the proposal of project. In November 2007, the huge project was officially started. After about ten months of hard work, in early October 2008, the first phase was finished and a picturesque ecological park was displayed to the residents. Since then Taicang people have had their own recreational area to play, walk, camp and relax.

==Environmental function==
Wetlands are known as 'lungs of the urban city'. Jincang Lake is a typical wetland park. Wetlands have a unique function like a sponge, which can take in certain harmful substances. Due to wetlands' great contributions, the quality of water, environmental protection and the variety of ecological diversity can be significantly improved. The construction of Jincang Lake also insisted that principle centered in nature. Jincanghu covers an area of 6&amp;nbsp;square kilometers. In the middle of the park, a central lake covers 600,000&amp;nbsp;square meters. Surrounding the center, many different sizes of man-made streams cross. Jincang Lake has been approved to enter the provincial list. Until then, Suzhou's provincial wetland parks had increased to six and the total extent exceeded 56000&amp;nbsp;acres.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.myvacation.cn/zijia/jingdian/jd_128.html |title=太仓金仓湖_江苏太仓市自驾游景点_旅游情报网 |publisher=Myvacation.cn |date= |accessdate=2011-12-29 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120509111543/http://www.myvacation.cn/zijia/jingdian/jd_128.html |archivedate=2012-05-09 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Events==

Because the area of Jincang Lake is large enough and the inner environment is beautiful, many big events have chosen it as their location. The table below shows some significant events in recent years.

==Attractions==

Inside Jincang Lake, some tourist spots are set up for visitors to enjoy and play. Each spot has both natural and delicate features. They can give us a new and different experience which differs from fast urban life.

===Barefoot Forest Park===
One feature is the Barefoot Forest Park (赤足森林, Pinyin:ChìZúSēnLín).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://bbs.etaicang.com/read-htm-tid-57138-page-e.html |title=太仓金仓湖(图片、地址附景点介绍)&amp;#124;聚焦太仓 - 太仓论坛 |publisher=Bbs.etaicang.com |date= |accessdate=2011-12-29 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160303221745/http://bbs.etaicang.com/read-htm-tid-57138-page-e.html |archivedate=2016-03-03 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.xinhuanet.com/chinanews/2008-10/31/content_14792453.htm |title=:: 新华网 :: - 地方联播 |publisher=Xinhuanet.com |date=2008-10-31 |accessdate=2011-12-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; The concept originates in Germany. The original meaning was to get closer to nature and walk [[barefoot]] to feel nature's existence.  In Taicang, there are many German-invested companies and a lot of Germans live in the city. In order to provide a leisure place for foreign and local people, the government decided to build this barefoot forest park. Now, with the popularity of the park, government takes full advantage and tourism in the city is obviously enhanced.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="17281">'''João da Gama''' (c. 1540 – after 1591) was a [[Portuguese people|Portuguese]] [[explorer]] and colonial administrator in the [[Far East]] in the last quarter of the 16th century. He was the grandson of [[Vasco da Gama]]. João da Gama sailed from [[Macau]] to northeast and rounded [[Japan]] by north. He crossed the [[Pacific Ocean]] at the northernmost latitudes taken until then by Europeans. Forced by the circumstances of his voyage, he became also a [[circumnavigation|circumnavigator]] (one of the first to do it eastwards). The lands northeast of Japan which João da Gama discovered were the target of legend and speculation in the centuries that followed, inspiring its search by European powers.

== Early years and voyages to the East ==

Not much is known of his childhood and youth, though is believed that he was born around 1540. His parents were Guiomar de Vilhena, Countess of Vidigueira and Francisco da Gama, 2nd [[Count of Vidigueira]], son of the explorer [[Vasco da Gama]], the discoverer of the sea route to the [[Eastern world|East]]. He was married with Joana de Menezes and had one son, Vasco da Gama, who later became captain in [[Chaul]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.geni.com/people/Jo%C3%A3o-da-Gama-capit%C3%A3o-de-Malaca/6000000016411827232]&lt;/ref&gt; João da Gama became the captain of [[Portuguese Malacca|Malacca]] between 1578 and 1582. He received cordially the Portuguese representative who brought the news of the coronation of [[Philip II of Spain]] as king of Portugal, but only recognized the new order later, after indication of the Viceroy of [[Portuguese India|India]]. He had numerous political conflicts within his mandate, caused by alleged personal irregularities that had brought him into political confrontation with the administrative bodies of the city, which led to a Judicial process.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.catedra-alberto-benveniste.org/_fich/15/RC31I100_artigo_lucio_e_angelo.pdf] ''A Diáspora Sefardita na Ásia e no Brasil e a interligação das redes comerciais na modernidade'', Lucio Manuel Rocha de Sousa e Angelo Adriano Faria de Assis, page 111, Revista de Cultura - 31 - 2009 / 2009 - 31 - Review of Culture&lt;/ref&gt; He was accused of harming the interests of Malacca and called to [[Lisbon]] to answer for his actions and expose his defense.

He returned to the East with the aim of fulfilling the [[nanban trade]] (the "voyage of Japan"), between Macau ([[China]]) and [[Nagasaki]] (Japan), a trade route monopolized by Portugal. Gama was married to the daughter of D. João de Meneses Baroche, Captain of Cochin. He left his wife at his residence in [[Cochin]] and headed to Macau in 1588, accompanied by his brother Miguel da Gama. In that year the annual voyage had not yet been carried due to the sudden death of the captain of Macau, Jerónimo de Sousa. Following the trade agreement between the Portuguese-Jew [[New Christian]] Bartolomeu Landeiro and the city of Macau, Jerónimo de Sousa was also preparing to send a ship to the [[Philippines]]. In parallel to this, was then issued the anti-Christian edict in Japan. João da Gama, hoping to get a higher profit and new possibilities, and against all prohibitions, decided for an expedition to [[New Spain]] at his own expense and at his own risk.&lt;ref&gt;''A Diáspora Sefardita na Ásia e no Brasil e a interligação das redes comerciais na modernidade'', Lucio Manuel Rocha de Sousa e Angelo Adriano Faria de Assis, page 111&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://repositorio.ucp.pt/bitstream/10400.14/13527/1/Enemy_at_the_Gates.pdf] ''ENEMY AT THE GATES, Macao, Manila and the “Pinhal Episode” (end of the 16th Century)'', Paulo Jorge de Sousa Pinto, Catholic University of Portugal&lt;/ref&gt;

Da Gama was well regarded in Macau, as can be seen from the letter that the Macau City Council wrote to the king on 30 June
1588, in which praises da Gama, then captain of Macau and Japan. They also asked the king that he be granted for life with this captaincy. The ''Câmara'' of Macau also mentions the subject of a recent Spanish (''Castilian'') travel to Macau, and the reasons why should be prohibited, among other subjects. Gama and the Council of Macau also argued that the profits of the voyage could sustain churches, a [[Santa Casa da Misericórdia|Misericordia]], and two hospitals, being a leper one of them. Da Gama took possession of a carrack of 600 tons that instead of going from Macau to India, went to Mexico, where they could accomplish much more lucrative deals, which were coveted by residents of Macau. Years later, members of the Macau City Council would publicly condemn and criticize da Gama and his voyage.

== The crossing of the Pacific ==

[[File:Oceano pacifico e Estreito de Anian.jpg|thumb|right|300px|Atlas of [[João Teixeira Albernaz I]], 1643, showing the North Pacific Ocean and the area reached by João da Gama, including ''islands João da Gama found'' (possibly the Kuril islands, hypothesis clearly shown by maps as of Joseph Nicolas Delisle. Other maps also made reference to a mythical more largest land, also northeast of Japan). The mythical or "recognized" [[Strait of Anián]], separating Asia and the Americas, is also shown. Part of the known North American coast is possibly widely shifted to the northwest]]
The decision of D. João da Gama, a risk taker, was taken with the knowledge that it was an illegal enterprise, since it was well known the prohibition of trade between the world areas of Portugal and [[Crown of Castile|Castile]] (later ''Spain'') by the Treaties of [[Treaty of Tordesillas|Tordesillas]] and [[Treaty of Zaragoza|Zaragoza]], ban reinforced by the letters personally written by Philip II to the Viceroys of New Spain and India, and also directly to the administrative bodies of Macau and the Philippines in 1589 and 1590s, leading to the expulsion of the Spanish from Macau in 1592.

The unusual and exceptional decision to make the journey was due to the expectation that the initiative might be regarded with tolerance, as happened to some Spanish precedents to Macau, but on the other hand, seems it had been taken in desperate position because da Gama was possibly aware that if he returned to [[Goa]], he would possily be arrested due to charges of having committed serious irregularities. This reality is reflected in the letter that the king Phillip II (I of Portugal) sent to the Viceroy on February 6, 1589, which ordered him "that the noble (João da Gama) that came from China, should be arrest in irons and taken to the Kingdom aboard this Armada", as was also appointed before, in 1587, by the Crown.

João da Gama, however, seemed unaware of this reality in 1588, since he sent from Macau, on November 20 of the same year, a letter to the king informing him of his intention to go to Spain via Mexico, with an alleged justification of give in person to the king part of his mission to China, and show how easy it seemed to be undertaken its conquest (in fact the Portuguese in Macau were against such project). Two days earlier, on November 18, Domingos Segurado, in Macau, also wrote to the king to inform the wreck of a Spanish ship from New Spain in Macau, and the shipment of its crew on da Gama's ship, owner of the voyage to Japan, which, once in Macau, accepted the order of the [[Viceroy of India]] to transport that crew to Mexico, being himself in the office of Captain of Macau during Gama's absence, even suggesting his own appointment to that office, or as a reward for his services, the provision of two voyages from China to New Spain.

Legend repeated in his other map of 1720, more extended to the northwest and already with both the Californias connected to mainland, in a northwest coast, possibly corresponding to the present day United States north coast and Canada]]

After starting the voyage in Macau and due to a damage caused by a typhon, da Gama was forced to seek refuge at the island of [[Amakusa]] on the Japanese coast. After repairs, he continued on his voyage in October 1589. He reached Mexico after having traversed the Pacific at a much higher latitude (around 45° N and possibly further north) than the course ordinarily taken by the Spanish [[Manila galleons]] (usually near or around 40° N) travelling between Manila and Mexico. Da Gama touched at a place which has since been called Ezo (Yezo) - the island of [[Hokkaido]], followed by unveiling a 'Land of Gama", which may correspond to one or some of the [[Kuril Islands]]. Arriving at Acapulco in March 1590, The navigator may well have gone north along the Japanese main coasts and the Kuril Islands, to near the [[Aleutians]] and then down to the American coast. His name was attached, originally on Portuguese maps, to a vague land he sighted northeast of Japan.&lt;ref&gt;[http://asj.upd.edu.ph/mediabox/archive/ASJ-04-01-1966/texeira-moric-benyovsky-04-01-66.pdf] ''COUNT MORIC BENYOVSZKY: A HUNGARIAN CRUSOE IN ASIA'' - FR.

The hypothesis that João da Gama explored or reached [[North America]] as far north as [[João Rodrigues Cabrilho|Juan Rodriguez Cabrillo (''João Rodrigues Cabrilho'')]], [[Bartolomé Ferrer]], [[Francis Drake]], and Francisco de Gali (or de Gaulle), who in 1584 had sailed from Macau and possibly sighted islands with metals ''500 leagues'' to the east or east-northeast of southeast Japan (around 29° N or further north),&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=FgP-VCgXa7oC&amp;dq=Feancisco+de+Gali+macao&amp;hl=pt-PT&amp;source=gbs_navlinks_s] A Chronological History of the Discoveries in the South Sea Or Pacific Ocean, Volume 2 from A Chronological History of the Discoveries in the South Sea or Pacific Ocean - 5 Volume Set, Cambridge Library Collection - Maritime Exploration, James Burney, Cambridge University Press, 2010, pages 59, 60, 61&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=cxLRAgAAQBAJ&amp;dq=Feancisco+de+Gali+macao&amp;hl=pt-PT&amp;source=gbs_navlinks_s] Early Mapping of the Pacific: The Epic Story of Seafarers, Adventurers, and Cartographers Who Mapped the Earth's Greatest Ocean, Thomas Suarez, Tuttle Publishing, 2013&lt;/ref&gt; or as later, [[Sebastião Rodrigues Soromenho]]; - or landed further north, taking into account his route from the East, lacks direct evidence, due to the loss of much of the documentation on the nearby North American route he took and on his other possible landings in North America, except on the news of his successful arrival in [[Acapulco]], in March 1590{{citation needed|date=April 2017}}. Nevertheless, several maps later point to João da Gama's exploration and discovery of a large portion of the west and northwest of the then unknown and known coasts of North America. In the 1630s, documents came into possession of the Portuguese cartographer [[João Teixeira Albernaz I|João Teixeira Albernaz]] when he was in Sevile. The pappers eventually included a sketch of a long north Pacific coast which João da Gama skimmed en route.&lt;ref&gt;Early Mapping of the Pacific: The Epic Story of Seafarers, Adventurers, and Cartographers Who Mapped the Earth's Greatest Ocean, Thomas Suarez&lt;/ref&gt;

Arriving in Acapulco, before being arrested, he managed to sell the goods, through two [[Sephardic]] New Christians, and getting in the negotiations 22,000 pesos, of which two thousand would be used to pay debts and the remaining twenty thousand would be sent to [[Brazil]] inland through his representatives (four traders, two of which would possibly be New Christians). It seems they were successful in the mission.

Da Gama's voyage was directly contrary to the Iberian crown legislation, prohibiting commercial transactions between the [[Spanish empire|Spanish]] and the [[Portuguese empire|Portuguese]] empires. Accordingly, he was arrested and his ship and remainned cargo impounded by the local authorities.
However, in spite of the fact that Portugal and Spain were then "united", da Gama's remained goods and his charts and logs of navigation were confiscated. His remained goods were evaluated at 140,000 pesos. The process of João da Gama went to [[Casa de la Contratación]] in [[Seville]], where it came to drag. Indeed, the enterprise of João da Gama was no more welcome to Spain that had been that of Vasco, his grandfather, a century before. The Portuguese crew and merchants who had participated in the trip returned to Macau via Philippines, after a stay in Mexico, where they brought silver, and he himself was sent to Seville to be tried by the audiencia of the Casa de la Contratación.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.jstor.org/journal/hispamerhistrevi] The Spanish Lake, William Lytle Schurz.

Before seeing solved the process to which he was subjected, João da Gama have possibly died in Spain or Portugal after 1591 or 1592.

== The search for "Joao-da-Gama-Land" or "Gamaland" ==

In the 18th century, the [[Russian Empire|Russians]], after crossing [[Siberia]] and reaching the [[Bering Strait]] between Siberia and [[Alaska]], took the initiative in exploring the northern edges of the Pacific. One of the goals of the Russian [[Great Northern Expedition]], led by the [[Danish people|Danish]] explorer [[Vitus Bering]], was to proceed from [[Okhotsk]] on [[Kamchatka]] and reconnoiter from there for the legendary "Joao-da-Gama-Land". From "Joao-da-Gama-Land", Bering's group was to set out farther east to the coast of North America.

The mythical Gamaland was believed either to have existed between Kamchatka and the American continent. During the next 150 years contradictory maps depicted a jumble of real or imagined islands between Hokkaido and Kamchatka, confusing the existing Kuril Islands with the Company Land, State Island (named after the exploration in 1643 of the main southern Kuril Islands and [[Sakhalin]] by the Dutch explorer [[Maarten Gerritsz Vries]]), Terra Esonis, and Gamaland. Sometime around 1731, the Russian Admiralty College requested the Academy of Sciences to prepare a map of the North Pacific. [[Joseph Nicolas Delisle]] prepared the map and an accompanying ''mémoire'' based on work done by his elder brother [[Guillaume Delisle|Guillaume]]. This showed the three islands mentioned above and the "Land seen by Dom Juan de Gama", which trails off in the direction of America. When the route of the second voyage of Vitus Bering was determined in [[Petropavlovsk-Kamchatsky|Petropavlovsk]] in May 1741, this map or another based on it clearly influenced the choice.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=0eslAAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PR4&amp;lpg=PR4&amp;dq=Historical+Dictionary+of+the+Discovery+and+Exploration+of+the+Northwest+Coast+of+America&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=8E7Ek_9jNd&amp;sig=64CKM9mVpZIGxOid8QEv4d4CXig&amp;hl=pt-PT&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0CDoQ6AEwA2oVChMI3IiDm_P5xgIVpXHbCh07Zwl8#v=onepage&amp;q=Da%20gama&amp;f=false] Historical Dictionary of the Discovery and Exploration of the Northwest Coast of America - Historical Dictionaries of Discovery and Exploration, Author: Robin Inglis.

'''Lacus Oblivionis''' ([[Latin]] for "Lake of Forgetfulness") is a small [[lunar mare]] on the surface of the [[Moon]]. It is located at 21.0° S, 168.0° W and is 50&amp;nbsp;km in diameter.  The name was adopted by the IAU in 1976.&lt;ref&gt;[http://planetarynames.wr.usgs.gov/Feature/3213 Lacus Oblivionis], Feature 3213, Gazetteer of Planetary Nomenclature, International Astronomical Union (IAU) Working Group for Planetary System Nomenclature (WGPSN)&lt;/ref&gt;

The crater Mohorovičić R (satellite of [[Mohorovičić (crater)|Mohorovičić]]) lies to the northeast, and the crater Sniadecki Y (satellite of [[Sniadecki (crater)|Sniadecki]]) lies to the southwest.

''Clematis'' is a [[genus]] of woody based [[perennial plant|perennial]]s, mostly [[vine|climbers]] with a twining habit, though some are grown as groundcover or as [[herbaceous plants]]. They can be [[evergreen]] or [[deciduous]]. They bear flowers in all shades except black, pure blue, pure red and orange. The flowers are often large and showy. They can be single or double, fragrant or unscented, compact or vigorous, in a wide range of shapes and sizes. The flowering period varies from early spring to late summer. Many spring-flowering cultivars produce a second flush of blooms after the main display has finished, and many have attractive silky seed-heads prolonging the period of interest. Clematis can be grown against walls, fences, over [[pergolas]] and [[obelisk]]s, or through other shrubs and trees.&lt;ref name=RHSAZ&gt;{{cite book|title=RHS A-Z encyclopedia of garden plants|year=2008|publisher=Dorling Kindersley|location=United Kingdom|isbn=1405332964|pages=1136}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="73528">[[File:Bell Heather.JPG|thumb|300px|Bell heather, ''[[Erica cinerea]]'', is the type species of the family.]]
This is a list of genera in the plant family [[Ericaceae]], which includes the '''heaths''', '''heathers''', '''epacrids''', and '''blueberries'''.  As currently circumscribed, the family contains about 4000 species into more than 120 genera classified into 9 subfamilies.&lt;ref name=Stevens2008/&gt;

==Current understanding==
The list shown here follows the phylogenetic classification of Kron ''et al.'' (2002),&lt;ref name=Kron2002/&gt; with modifications as per Stevens ''et al.'' (2004),&lt;ref name=Stevens2004/&gt; Quinn ''et al.'' (2005),&lt;ref name=Quinn2005/&gt; Albrecht ''et al.'' (2010),&lt;ref name=Albrecht2010/&gt; Gillespie &amp; Kron (2010),&lt;ref name=Gillespie2010/&gt; and Craven (2011).&lt;ref name=Craven2011/&gt;

Nonetheless, much of the taxonomy within the [[Vaccinioideae]] is in flux. Multiple studies of the [[Gaultherieae]] have now shown ''[[Pernettya]]'', ''[[Diplycosia]]'' (already including ''Pernettyopsis''), and ''[[Tepuia]]'' to be nested within ''[[Gaultheria]]'',&lt;ref name=Powell2001/&gt;&lt;ref name=Bush2009/&gt; although publication formalizing the transfers are yet to be published. Similarly, most of [[Vaccinieae]] has not been investigated using molecular techniques, and many genera are likely [[paraphyletic]] or [[polyphyletic]]. Neotropical and Old World Vaccinioideae are particularly poorly known.&lt;ref name=Kron2002-blueberry/&gt; Within the Epacrideae preliminary evidence supports the lumping of ''Budawangia'' and ''Rupicola'' with ''[[Epacris]]'',&lt;ref name=Kron2002/&gt; but these genera still stand for the time being.

Relevant recent synonymy include  ''[[Bruckenthalia]]'' with ''[[Erica]]'',&lt;ref name=Oliver1996/&gt; ''Leiophyllum'' and ''Loiseleuria''  with ''[[Kalmia]]'',&lt;ref name="Kron1996"/&gt; and ''Diplarche'' and ''[[Menziesia]]'' with ''[[Rhododendron]]''.&lt;ref name=Craven2011/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4343">This is a '''list of Superfund sites in North Dakota''' designated under the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act (CERCLA) environmental law.  The CERCLA federal law of 1980 authorized the [[United States Environmental Protection Agency]] (EPA) to create a list of [[Pollution|polluted]] locations requiring a long-term response to clean up hazardous material contaminations.&lt;ref&gt;P.L. 96-510, {{USC|42|9601|9675}}, December 11, 1980.&lt;/ref&gt;   These locations are known as [[Superfund]] sites, and are placed on the [[National Priorities List]] (NPL).  The NPL guides the EPA in "determining which sites warrant further investigation" for [[environmental remediation]].&lt;ref name="NPL"/&gt;  As of May 5, 2010, [[North Dakota]] is the only state with no Superfund sites on the National Priorities List.&lt;ref name="NPL"&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.epa.gov/superfund/sites/npl/ |title=National Priorities List |publisher=United States Enivironmental Protection Agency |accessdate=April 25, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; No sites are currently proposed for entry on the list, but two have been cleaned up and removed from the NPL.&lt;ref name="NPL"/&gt;

A '''minor-planet group''' is a population of [[minor planet]]s that share broadly similar orbits. Members are generally unrelated to each other, unlike in an [[asteroid family]], which often results from the break-up of a single asteroid. It is customary to name a group of asteroids after the first member of that group to be discovered, which is often the largest.

== Groups out to the orbit of Earth ==

There are relatively few asteroids that orbit close to the Sun. Several of these groups are hypothetical at this point in time, with no members having yet been discovered; as such, the names they have been given are provisional.
* [[Vulcanoid asteroid]]s are hypothetical asteroids that orbit entirely within the orbit of [[Mercury (planet)|Mercury]] (have an [[aphelion]] of less than 0.3874&amp;nbsp;AU). A few searches for vulcanoids have been conducted but none have been discovered so far.
* [[Atira asteroid]]s (Apohele; Interior-Earth Objects) are a small group of known asteroids whose aphelion is less than 0.983&amp;nbsp;AU, meaning they orbit entirely within Earth's orbit. The group is named after its first confirmed member, [[163693&amp;nbsp;Atira]]. {{As of|2017}}, the group consists of 18 members, 6 of which are numbered.&lt;ref name="jpl-search-by-smallest-aphelion" /&gt;
* [[List of Mercury-crossing minor planets|Mercury-crosser asteroid]]s having a [[perihelion]] smaller than Mercury's 0.3075&amp;nbsp;AU.
* [[List of Venus-crossing minor planets|Venus-crosser asteroid]]s having a perihelion smaller than [[Venus]]'s 0.7184&amp;nbsp;AU. This group includes the above Mercury-crossers (if their aphelion is greater than Venus's perihelion. All known Mercury crossers satisfy this condition).
* [[List of Earth-crossing minor planets|Earth-crosser asteroid]]s having a perihelion smaller than [[Earth]]'s 0.9833&amp;nbsp;AU. This group includes the above Mercury- and Venus-crossers, apart from the Apoheles. They are also divided into the
** [[Aten asteroid]]s having a [[semi-major axis]] less than 1&amp;nbsp;AU, named after [[2062&amp;nbsp;Aten]].
** [[Apollo asteroid]]s having a [[semi-major axis]] greater than 1&amp;nbsp;AU, named after [[1862&amp;nbsp;Apollo]].
* [[Arjuna asteroid]]s are somewhat vaguely defined as having orbits similar to Earth's; i.e. with an average orbital radius of around 1&amp;nbsp;AU and with low eccentricity and inclination.&lt;ref name=geo /&gt; Due to the vagueness of this definition some asteroids belonging to the [[Atira asteroid|Atira]], [[Amor asteroid|Amor]], [[Apollo asteroid|Apollo]] or [[Aten asteroid|Aten]] groups can also be classified as Arjunas. The term was introduced by [[Spacewatch]] and does not refer to an existing asteroid; examples of Arjunas include [[1991&amp;nbsp;VG]].
* [[Earth trojan]]s are asteroids located in the Earth–Sun [[Lagrangian point]]s {{L4}} and {{L5}}. Their location in the sky as observed from Earth's surface would be fixed at about 60 degrees east and west of the Sun, and as people tend to search for asteroids at much greater elongations few searches have been done in these locations. The only known Earth trojan is {{mpl|2010 TK|7}}.
* [[Near-Earth asteroid]]s is a catch-all term for asteroids whose orbit closely approaches that of Earth. It includes almost all of the above groups, as well as the [[Amor asteroid]]s.

== Groups out to the orbit of Mars ==
* The [[Amor asteroid|Amor]] asteroids, named after [[1221 Amor]], are [[near-Earth asteroid]]s that are not [[List of Earth-crossing minor planets|Earth-crossers]], having a perihelion just outside the Earth's orbit.
* [[List of Mars-crossing minor planets|Mars-crosser asteroid]]s have orbits that cross that of Mars, but do not necessarily closely approach the Earth's.
* [[Mars trojan]]s follow or lead Mars on its orbit, at either of the two [[Lagrangian point]]s 60° ahead ({{L4}}) or behind ({{L5}}). As of March 2008, four are known. The largest appears to be [[5261&amp;nbsp;Eureka]].
* Many of the Earth-, Venus-, and Mercury-crosser asteroids have aphelia greater than 1&amp;nbsp;AU.

==The asteroid belt==
{{main|Asteroid belt}}
[[File:Kirkwood Gaps.svg|thumb|[[Histogram]] showing the four most prominent [[Kirkwood gap]]s and a possible division into inner, middle and outer [[main-belt]] asteroids:&lt;br /&gt;{{legend2|#005aff|border=1px solid #333|inner main-belt ([[Semi-major axis|a]] &amp;lt; 2.5 [[Astronomical unit|AU]])}}&lt;br /&gt;{{legend2|#ffa500|border=1px solid #222|middle main-belt (2.5 AU &amp;lt; a &amp;gt; 2.82 AU)}}&lt;br /&gt;{{legend2|#55d400|border=1px solid #333|outer main-belt (a &amp;gt; 2.82 AU}}]]
[[File:Main belt i vs a.png|thumb|Asteroid groups out to the orbit of Jupiter. The asteroid belt is shown in red]]

The overwhelming majority of known asteroids have orbits lying between the orbits of [[Mars]] and [[Jupiter]], roughly between 2 and 4&amp;nbsp;[[astronomical unit|AU]]. These could not form a planet due to the gravitational influence of Jupiter. Jupiter's gravitational influence, through [[orbital resonance]], clears [[Kirkwood gap]]s in the asteroid belt, first recognised by [[Daniel Kirkwood]] in 1874.

The region with the densest concentration (lying between the Kirkwood gaps at 2.06 and 3.27&amp;nbsp;AU, with [[eccentricity (orbit)|eccentricities]] below about 0.3, and inclinations smaller than 30°) is called the [[asteroid belt]]. It can be further subdivided by the Kirkwood Gaps into the:
* '''Inner asteroid belt''', inside of the strong Kirkwood gap at 2.50&amp;nbsp;AU due to the 3:1 Jupiter [[orbital resonance]]. The largest member is [[4&amp;nbsp;Vesta]].
** It apparently also includes a group called the main-belt I asteroids which have a semi-major axis between 2.3&amp;nbsp;AU and 2.5&amp;nbsp;AU and an inclination of less than 18°.
* '''Middle''' (or intermediate) '''asteroid belt''', between the 3:1 and 5:2 Jupiter orbital resonances, the latter at 2.82&amp;nbsp;AU. The largest member is [[Ceres (dwarf planet)|Ceres]]. This group is apparently split into the:
** Main-belt IIa asteroids which have a semi-major axis between 2.5&amp;nbsp;AU and 2.706&amp;nbsp;AU and an inclination less than 33°.
** Main-belt IIb asteroids which have a semi-major axis between 2.706&amp;nbsp;AU and 2.82&amp;nbsp;AU and an inclination less than 33°.
* '''Outer asteroid belt''' between the 5:2 and 2:1 Jupiter orbital resonances. The largest member is [[10&amp;nbsp;Hygiea]]. This group is apparently split into the:
** Main-belt IIIa asteroids which have a semi-major axis between 2.82&amp;nbsp;AU and 3.03&amp;nbsp;AU, an eccentricity less than .35, and an inclination less than 30°.
** Main-belt IIIb asteroids which have a semi-major axis between 3.03&amp;nbsp;AU and 3.27&amp;nbsp;AU, an eccentricity less than .35, and an inclination less than 30°.

===Other groups out to the orbit of Jupiter===

There are a number of more or less distinct asteroid groups outside the asteroid belt, distinguished either by mean distance from the Sun, or particular combinations of several orbital elements:
* [[Hungaria family|Hungaria asteroid]]s, with a mean orbital radius between 1.78&amp;nbsp;AU and 2&amp;nbsp;AU, an eccentricity less than 0.18, and inclination between 16° and 34°. Named after [[434&amp;nbsp;Hungaria]], these are just outside Mars's orbit, and are possibly attracted by the 9:2 Jupiter resonance or the 3:2 Mars resonance.
* [[Phocaea family|Phocaea asteroid]]s, with a mean orbital radius between 2.25&amp;nbsp;AU and 2.5&amp;nbsp;AU, an eccentricity greater than 0.1, and inclination between 18° and 32°. Some sources group the Phocaeas asteroids with the Hungarias, but the division between the two groups is real and caused by the 4:1 resonance with Jupiter. Named after [[25&amp;nbsp;Phocaea]].
* [[Alinda asteroid]]s have a mean orbital radius of 2.5&amp;nbsp;AU and an eccentricity between 0.4 and 0.65 (approximately). These objects are held by the 3:1 resonance with Jupiter and a 4:1 resonance with [[Earth]]. Many Alinda asteroids have perihelia very close to Earth's orbit and can be difficult to observe for this reason. Alinda asteroids are ''not'' in stable orbits and eventually will collide either with Jupiter or terrestrial planets. Named after [[887&amp;nbsp;Alinda]].
* [[Pallas family]] asteroids have a mean orbital radius between 2.7 and 2.8&amp;nbsp;AU and an inclination between 30° and 38°. Named after [[2&amp;nbsp;Pallas]].
* [[Griqua group|Griqua asteroid]]s have an orbital radius between 3.1&amp;nbsp;AU and 3.27&amp;nbsp;AU and an eccentricity greater than 0.35. These asteroids are in stable 2:1 [[libration]] with Jupiter, in high-inclination orbits. There are about 5 to 10 of these known so far, with [[1362&amp;nbsp;Griqua]] and [[8373&amp;nbsp;Stephengould]] the most prominent.
* [[Cybele asteroid]]s have a mean orbital radius between 3.27&amp;nbsp;AU and 3.7&amp;nbsp;AU, an eccentricity less than 0.3, and an inclination less than 25°. This group appears to cluster around the 7:4 resonance with Jupiter. Named after [[65&amp;nbsp;Cybele]].&lt;ref name=tanton /&gt;
* [[Hilda group|Hilda asteroid]]s have a mean orbital radius between 3.7&amp;nbsp;AU and 4.2&amp;nbsp;AU, an eccentricity greater than 0.07, and an inclination less than 20°. These asteroids are in a 3:2 resonance with Jupiter. Named after [[153&amp;nbsp;Hilda]].
* [[Thule asteroid]]s are in a 4:3 resonance with Jupiter and the group is known to consist of [[279&amp;nbsp;Thule]], {{mp|(186024) 2001 QG|207}}, and {{mp|(185290) 2006 UB|219}}.&lt;ref name="Broz-2008" /&gt;
* [[Jupiter trojan]]s have a mean orbital radius between 5.05&amp;nbsp;AU and 5.4&amp;nbsp;AU, and lie in elongated, curved regions around the two [[Lagrangian point]]s 60° ahead and behind of Jupiter. The leading point, {{L4}}, is called the [[Greek camp]] and the trailing {{L5}} point is called the [[Trojan camp]], after the two opposing camps of the legendary [[Trojan War]]; with one exception apiece, objects in each node are named for members of that side of the conflict. [[617&amp;nbsp;Patroclus]] in the Trojan camp and [[624&amp;nbsp;Hektor]] in the Greek camp are "misplaced" in the enemy camps.

There is a forbidden zone between the Hildas and the Trojans (roughly 4.05&amp;nbsp;AU to 5.0&amp;nbsp;AU). Aside from [[279&amp;nbsp;Thule]] and five objects in unstable-looking orbits, Jupiter's gravity has swept everything out of this region.

== Groups beyond the orbit of Jupiter ==

Most of the minor planets beyond the orbit of Jupiter are believed to be composed of [[ice]]s and other [[volatiles]]. Many are similar to [[comet]]s, differing only in that the [[perihelion|perihelia]] of their orbits are too distant from the Sun to produce a significant tail.
* [[Damocloid asteroid]]s, also known as the "Oort cloud group," are named after [[5335&amp;nbsp;Damocles]]. They are defined to be objects that have "fallen in" from the [[Oort cloud]], so their aphelia are generally still out past [[Uranus]], but their perihelia are in the inner solar system. They have high eccentricities and sometimes high inclinations, including [[retrograde orbit]]s. The definition of this group is somewhat fuzzy, and may overlap significantly with comets.
* [[Centaur (minor planet)|Centaurs]] have a mean orbital radius roughly between 5.4&amp;nbsp;AU and 30&amp;nbsp;AU. They are currently believed to be [[trans-Neptunian object]]s that "fell in" after encounters with gas giants. The first of these to be identified was [[2060&amp;nbsp;Chiron]] ([[944&amp;nbsp;Hidalgo]] was discovered before, but not identified as a distinct orbital class).

== Groups at or beyond the orbit of Neptune ==
* The [[Neptune trojan]]s currently consist of thirteen objects. The first one to be discovered was {{mpl|2001 QR|322}}.
* [[Trans-Neptunian object]]s (TNOs) are anything with a mean orbital radius greater than 30&amp;nbsp;AU. This classification includes the Kuiper-belt objects (KBOs), the scattered disc, and the Oort cloud.
** [[Kuiper belt|Kuiper-belt]] objects extend from roughly 30&amp;nbsp;AU to 50&amp;nbsp;AU and are broken into the following subcategories:
*** [[Resonant trans-Neptunian object|Resonant objects]] occupy orbital resonances with Neptune, excluding the 1:1 resonance of the Neptune trojans. 
****[[Plutino]]s are by far the most common resonant KBOs and are in a 2:3 resonance with Neptune, just like [[Pluto]]. The perihelion of such an object tends to be close to Neptune's orbit (much as happens with Pluto), but when the object comes to perihelion, Neptune alternates between being 90 degrees ahead of and 90 degrees behind of the object, so there's no chance of a collision. The MPC defines any object with a mean orbital radius between 39&amp;nbsp;AU and 40.5&amp;nbsp;AU to be a plutino. [[90482&amp;nbsp;Orcus]] and [[28978&amp;nbsp;Ixion]] are among the brightest known.
**** Other resonances. There are several known objects in the 1:2 resonance, dubbed ''twotinos'', with a mean orbital radius of 47.7&amp;nbsp;AU and an eccentricity of 0.37. There are several objects in the 2:5 (mean orbital radius of 55&amp;nbsp;AU), 4:7, 4:5, 3:10, 3:5, and 3:4 resonances, among others. The largest in the 2:5 resonance is {{mpl|(84522) 2002 TC|302}}, and the largest in the 3:10 resonance is {{mpl|(225088) 2007 OR|10}}.
*** [[Classical Kuiper belt object|Classical Kuiper-belt objects]], also known as cubewanos (after [[15760 Albion]], which had the provisional designation {{mpl|(15760) 1992 QB|1}} from its 1992 discovery to its 2018 naming), have a mean orbital radius between approximately 40.5&amp;nbsp;AU and 47&amp;nbsp;AU. Cubewanos are objects in the Kuiper belt that didn't get scattered and didn't get locked into a resonance with Neptune. The largest is {{dp|Makemake}}.
** [[Scattered disc]] objects (SDOs) typically have, unlike cubewanos and resonant objects, high-inclination, high-eccentricity orbits with perihelia that are still not too far from Neptune's orbit. They are assumed to be objects that encountered Neptune and were "scattered" out of their originally more circular orbits close to the ecliptic. The most massive known dwarf planet, [[Eris (dwarf planet)|Eris]], belongs to this category.
*** [[Detached object]]s (extended scattered disk) with generally highly elliptical, very large orbits of up to a few hundred AU and a perihelion too far from [[Neptune]]'s orbit for any significant interaction to occur. A more typical member of the extended disk is {{mpl|(148209) 2000 CR|105}}.
****[[Sednoid]]s have perihelia very far removed from the orbit of Neptune. This group is named after the best-known member, [[90377&amp;nbsp;Sedna]].
**The [[Oort cloud]] is a hypothetical cloud of comets with a mean orbital radius between approximately 50,000&amp;nbsp;AU and 100,000&amp;nbsp;AU. No Oort-cloud objects have been detected; the existence of this classification is only inferred from indirect evidence. Some astronomers have tentatively associated 90377&amp;nbsp;Sedna with the inner Oort cloud.

A '''lithophysa''' (plural '''lithophysae''', from Greek ''lithos'' "stone" + ''physan'' "to blow") is a [[felsic]] [[volcanic]] [[Rock (geology)|rock]] with a small spherulitic cavity and concentric chambers. Its shape is spherical or lenticular.

These cavities  are believed to be caused by expanding gases in [[tuff]]s and [[rhyolitic]] lavas before solidification. If it has become lined with [[crystal]]s it may be referred to as a [[geode]] or a [[thunderegg]]. The term [[vug]] is also used for similar cavities although the meaning of vug is usually restricted to cavities in rocks formed by the removal of material such as soluble minerals. These cavities usually contain layers of various colors (red, pink, gray, etc.) composed by crystals of quartz, chalcedony, hematite, fluorite and various colored oxides or other minerals.

Lithophysae are one of the many forms of [[silica]] (SiO2), as quartz, agate, opal, chalcedony, etc.  They can have an average diameter {{convert|5|-|20|cm}}, with a maximum of {{convert|60|–|80|cm}}. ''Lithophysae'' are also related to the [[spherulite]]s found in obsidians at Lipari, in Yellowstone Park, and other places.

'''Mallee Woodlands and Shrublands''' ('''MVG 14''')  is a [[List of Major Vegetation Groups in Australia|Major Vegetation Group]]  which occurs in semi-arid areas of southern [[Australia]].&lt;ref name=MVG14&gt;{{cite web|title = MVG 14-Mallee Woodlands and Shrublands| work=Australian Natural Resources Atlas|publisher=Australian Government|url=http://www.environment.gov.au/system/files/resources/17345e0a-40dc-4cae-97d3-e972c52c4ea7/files/vegfsheet-mvg14.pdf |accessdate=2011-03-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; The vegetation is dominated by [[mallee (habit)|mallee eucalypts]] which are rarely over 6 metres high. Other dominant plant genera are ''[[Melaleuca]]'', ''[[Acacia]]'' and ''[[Hakea]]''.&lt;ref name=MVG14/&gt;

The composition of the [[understorey]] depends on factors such as rainfall, soil composition as well as fire frequency and intensity. In subhumid areas, a variety of grasses and shrubs predominate, while in semi-arid areas hummock grasses (''[[Triodia (plant genus)|Triodia]]'' species) predominate.&lt;ref name=MVG14/&gt;

In 2001, the area covered by this vegetation group was estimated to be  65% of its pre [[1788 in Australia|1788]] coverage.&lt;ref name=Lindenmayer&gt;{{cite book|author=Lindenmayer, David|author2=Mark Burgman|title=Practical Conservation Biology|year=2005|publisher=CSIRO|url=http://www.publish.csiro.au/onborrowedtime/docs/PCB_Ch09.pdf|accessdate=2009-04-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The most extensive extant area of this group in Australia today is found in the [[Great Victoria Desert]]. Prior to 1788, the largest area occurred in the [[Murray-Darling basin]].&lt;ref name=MVG14/&gt;

The Major Vegetation Subgroups for this group are:
*Mallee with hummock grass
*Mallee with a dense shrubby understorey
*Mallee with an open shrubby understorey
*Mallee with a tussock grass understorey.&lt;ref name=MVG14/&gt;

'''McWorld''' is a term referring to the spreading of [[McDonald's]] restaurants throughout the world as the result of [[globalization]], and more generally to the effects of international '[[McDonaldization]]' of services and [[commercialization]] of goods as an element of globalization as a whole. The name also refers to a 1990s advertising campaign for McDonald's, and to a children's website launched by the firm in 2008.

== Globalization-related term ==
Critics claim that [[fast food]] chain restaurants such as McDonald's are destructive towards many aspects of the indigenous cultures in countries where they have been introduced.

In March 1992, an article first published in ''[[The Atlantic Monthly]]'' by [[Rutgers]] [[political science]] professor [[Benjamin Barber]] entitled "[[Jihad vs. McWorld]]", described international commercialization as one of two great clashing forces of the 21st century, the other being tribalistic [[fundamentalism]]. According to his writing, there are four imperatives which constitute the McWorld: a market imperative, a resource imperative, an [[information technology]] imperative, and an ecological imperative. The four imperatives are transnational, transideological, [[transculturation|transcultural]] and [[ecology|ecological]]. The contracting idea of McWorld, the Jihad, unlike those four imperatives, stress identity of each community.&lt;ref&gt;Benjamin R. Barber. (1992, March). "Jihad vs. McWorld," ''The Atlantic'' 269(3): 53-65.&lt;/ref&gt;

The clashing forces results from what Barber explains as the two core doctrines of our age: globalism and retribalization. It was expanded and published in 1995, and became a bestselling book.&lt;ref name="barber"&gt;[[Benjamin Barber|Barber, Benjamin R.]] ''[[Jihad vs. McWorld]]: How Globalism and Tribalism Are Reshaping the World.'' Hardcover: Crown, 1995, {{ISBN|0-8129-2350-2}}; Paperback: Ballantine Books, 1996, {{ISBN|0-345-38304-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
McWorld does not necessarily relate to democracy. It cares about the elements of democracy, but only to the degree that it promotes economic production and consumption.
In the book, Barber explains that liberalization of nation state oriented markets to a globalized market does not seem democratic. [[Democracy]] and [[liberal capitalism]] are terms commonly used as a correlation; how democracy leads to capitalist economy and vice versa. However Barber argues that [[multinational corporation]]s pursuing profits outside their home country due to competition has less correlation with [[open society]].

A 1999 book entitled ''Mustard Seed Versus McWorld'' by [[evangelicalism|evangelical]] [[minister of religion|minister]] Tom Sine implores [[Christians]] to reject the diminution of religious values that he contends results from excessive commercialization.&lt;ref name="sine"&gt;Sine, Tom. ''Mustard Seed Versus McWorld.'' 1999. {{ISBN|0-8010-9088-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== 1990s advertising campaign ==
The name McWorld was originally the name of a TV campaign for the restaurant by [[Leo Burnett]] that ran many of its ads during [[Saturday morning cartoons]] and on other television channels and programming blocks targeted toward children in the United States in the mid 1990s. The adverts featured the exciting McDonald's-related happenings that would purportedly occur if children ran the world.&lt;ref name="hood"&gt;Hood, Duncan. [http://www.kidscreen.com/articles/magazine/19990301/24619.html?print=yes "Revenge of the tweens"]. ''KidScreen Magazine'', March 1, 1999.&lt;/ref&gt; These included fantasies such as having gym class every period in school and eating McDonald's at every meal.  In addition to planet Earth, McWorld ads featured children ruling school, space, and other arenas typically dominated by an adult [[hegemony]]; adults were portrayed as inferior and ineffective.  Memorably, each spot concluded with the phrase, "McWORLD! Hey, it could happen!", as a guitar chord played in the background.  One such spot won a [[Golden Marble Award]] in 1998.&lt;ref name="selling"&gt;[http://www.findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m0FVE/is_19_3/ai_53015132 "'Raccoon' takes home awards for Hostess, Mithun Esty".] bill 'Selling to Kids', September 16, 1998.&lt;/ref&gt;

== 2008 website ==
McWorld was also the name of an interactive "virtual world" website launched by [[McDonald's]] in 2008 on [http://happymeal.com happymeal.com], and aimed at children. Visitors to the website could play games, go on quests, earn points and buy accessories for their treehouses and avatars (called "mPals"). The website shut down on February 7, 2014 and was replaced by McPlay.

While the McWorld website bore some similarities to the ideas in the original McWorld campaign, such as children being in charge, it is an essentially distinct concept, created independently for a younger age group. McWorld was named by a vote of kids on happymeal.com.&lt;ref name="mcworldvw"&gt;[http://vw.happymeal.com/en_US/ McWorld: It's a kid's world where kids rule.] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090212230549/http://vw.happymeal.com/en_US/ |date=2009-02-12 }} McDonald's Corporation, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

{{italic title}}
'''''No Place to Hide: Edward Snowden, the NSA, and the U.S. Surveillance State''''' is a 2014 non-fiction book by American investigative journalist [[Glenn Greenwald]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Snowden’s Story, Behind the Scenes|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2014/05/13/books/no-place-to-hide-by-glenn-greenwald.html?_r=0|work=The New York Times|accessdate=13 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was first published on May 13, 2014 through [[Metropolitan Books]] and details Greenwald's role in the [[Global surveillance disclosures (2013–present)|global surveillance disclosures]] as revealed by the former [[National Security Agency]] contractor [[Edward Snowden]].&lt;ref name='GuardMay1214'&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/may/12/glenn-greenwald-uk-arrest-me-edward-snowden-nsa|title=Glenn Greenwald: 'I don't trust the UK not to arrest me. Their behaviour has been extreme'|work=[[The Guardian]]|date=12 May 2014|accessdate=12 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The documents from the Snowden archive cited in the book are [http://www.glenngreenwald.net/#BookDocuments freely available online].

==Synopsis==
The book consists of five chapters; Contact, Ten Days in Hong Kong, Collect It All, The Harm of Surveillance, and the Fourth Estate, plus an introduction and an epilogue.
In the introduction Greenwald explains how his background as a blogger on surveillance practices of the American government attracted Edward Snowden's attention, and he summarizes the nature, legality, and evolution of such practices. Greenwald concludes by discussing how a global surveillance network has been created with the assistance of technology companies and the unique role of the internet in human history as a facilitator of such surveillance.

In the body of the book, Greenwald discusses how he became involved with the 2013 global surveillance disclosures. He began by traveling to [[Hong Kong]] to meet Edward Snowden, who had contacted Greenwald as an anonymous source purporting to have evidence of government surveillance. As Greenwald continued to investigate he uncovered more information that he later published, to much controversy. In the book Greenwald also discusses establishment media, which he states will traditionally avoid publishing anything that would put them at odds with the government and as such, are less helpful when it comes to the interests of the general public.

==Reception==
In his review for ''[[The Washington Post]]'', law professor [[David D. Cole|David Cole]] called ''No Place to Hide'' an important and illuminating book but wrote, "It would have been more important and illuminating were Greenwald able to acknowledge that the choices we face about regulating surveillance in the modern age are difficult and that there are no simple answers."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Cole|first=David|title=‘No Place to Hide’ by Glenn Greenwald, on the NSA’s sweeping efforts to 'Know it All'|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/no-place-to-hide-by-glenn-greenwald-on-the-nsas-sweeping-efforts-to-know-it-all/2014/05/12/dfa45dee-d628-11e3-8a78-8fe50322a72c_story.html|work=The Washington Post|accessdate=13 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Slate (magazine)|Slate]]'' gave a mostly positive review, stating that while the book "doesn’t offer an in-depth portrait of the leaker" it does serve as a good "primer" on "what was at stake when he downloaded the government’s most precious secrets onto a thumb drive".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Bazelon|first=Emily|title=Why Are You So Fearful, O Ye of Little Faith?|url=http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/books/2014/05/glenn_greenwald_s_book_no_place_to_hide_reviewed.html|work=[[Slate.com]]|accessdate=13 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The book was positively reviewed by [[Henry Porter (journalist)|Henry Porter]] in ''[[The Guardian]]''.&lt;ref name=GuardMay14&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/books/2014/may/19/no-place-to-hide-review-glenn-greenwald-nsa-gchq-surveillance-edward-snowden-spying|title=No Place to Hide review|author=Henry Porter|publisher=[[The Guardian]]|date=19 May 2014|accessdate=19 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Porter said that he found "reacquainting myself with the details of surveillance and intrusion by America's NSA and Britain's GCHQ was simply shocking. As the stories rolled out last year, there was almost too much to absorb...Greenwald's book is a tough read if you find these things disturbing."&lt;ref name=GuardMay14/&gt; Porter said that reading ''No Place to Hide'' he had wondered "...how we let the spies probe our lives with such inadequate controls, and how on earth we fell for the propaganda that this massive apparatus was there to protect, not control, us."&lt;ref name=GuardMay14/&gt; Critically Porter felt that the book lacked "...a chart or timeline of the major revelations as well as a proper index. And I did feel the argument lost momentum in the middle..." concluding that "...on the whole this is a vigorously executed and important book."&lt;ref name=GuardMay14/&gt; Porter reserved criticism for what he felt was a lack of appreciation by Greenwald of the importance of the efforts of [[Ewen MacAskill]] and his fellow ''Guardian'' writers in bringing the disclosures to publication.&lt;ref name=GuardMay14/&gt;

Glenn Greenwald received the 2014 [[Geschwister-Scholl-Preis]], an annual German literary award, for the German edition of ''No Place to Hide''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.geschwister-scholl-preis.de/preistraeger_2010-2019/2014/index.php |title=Preisträger 2014: Glenn Greenwald |trans-title=Award recipient 2014: Glenn Greenwald |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |date=n.d. |website=geschwister-scholl-preis.de |publisher=Börsenverein des Deutschen Buchhandels – Landesverband Bayern e.V.

[[File:Logo PSA World Rankings.jpg|225px|thumb|[[Dunlop Sport|Dunlop]] [[Professional Squash Association|PSA]] World Ranking]]
The '''Official Men's Squash World Ranking''' is the official world ranking for men's [[Squash (sport)|squash]]. The ranking is to rate the performance level of male professional squash player. It is also a merit-based method used for determining entry and seeding in men's squash tournaments. The rankings are produced monthly.&lt;ref name="rank&amp;divisor"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://psaworldtour.com/squash/guides/20161005113420_PSATourRuleBook20162017.pdf |title=PSA Tour Rule Book |publisher=PSA |page=41 |accessdate=2017-04-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; The current world number one is [[Mohamed El Shorbagy]] of Egypt.

==PSA ranking policy==
Players competing in PSA tournaments earn ranking points according to how far they get in the draw. The points available depend on the prize money and the draw size. The monthly rankings (issued on the 1st of the month) are used in selecting entries to tournaments and in determining the seeds.

The total number of points a player earns in the previous twelve months is divided by the number of tournaments played (a minimum divisor of ten is used) to give a ranking average. Where a player has played more than 10 tournaments the best scores may be selected (i.e. the lowest are not included) according to the Averaging Formula. (See table below.)

For example, a player who has competed in 14 events will have his best 11 scores used.  These will be accumulated and divided by 11.

Players competing in PSA World Tour Events earn ranking points according to the prize money, classification of the event, and the final position in the draw the player reaches.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5669">[[File:Hippocrenesource.jpg|right|thumb|The spring [[Hippocrene]], haunt of mythological Pegasides.]]

'''Pegasides''' ({{lang-el|Πηγασίδες}}) were [[nymph#Classification|nymphs]] of [[Greek mythology]] connected with wells and springs,&lt;ref name="Gardner"&gt;Gardner, James (1858-60);  p 639.&lt;/ref&gt; specifically those that the mythical horse [[Pegasus]] created by striking the ground with his hooves.&lt;ref name="Lempriere"&gt;Lemprière, John; Anthon, C. (1825);  p 530.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:HelikonZagarasMt.jpg|left|thumb|Mount [[mount Helicon|Helicon]] where [[Pegasus]] created the spring Hippocrene.]]
==The background==
According to Greek mythological tradition the winged horse Pegasus was the son of [[Poseidon]], sea and river god of the Greeks,&lt;ref name="Walford"&gt;Walford, Edward (1897);  p 77, vol 33.&lt;/ref&gt; equivalent to the Roman [[Neptune (mythology)|Neptune]].&lt;ref name="Anthon"&gt;Anthon, Charles (1857);  p 989.&lt;/ref&gt; The hero [[Bellerophon]] needed the untamed Pegasus to help him defeat the monster [[chimera (mythology)|Chimera]]. Hence, while Pegasus was drinking at the spring [[Pirene (fountain)|Pirene]] in [[Corinth]], Bellerophon caught him. Pegasus, startled, struck a rock with his hoof, creating the spring [[Hippocrene]] on [[Mount Helicon]].&lt;ref name="Adam"&gt;Adam, Alexander (1816);  p 394.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Le Poète voyageur.jpg|right|upright|thumb|Pegasus and Bellerophon by [[Gustave Moreau]], 19th century.]]
==The Pegasides==
The name Pegasides (plural form of the Greek feminine adjective ''Pegasis'') literally means "originating from or linked with Pegasus".&lt;ref name="Smith"&gt;Smith, William (1849);  p 165.&lt;/ref&gt; Hence, in poetry, the waters of Hippocrene and other springs that arose from the hoofprints of Pegasus are called Pegasides.&lt;ref&gt;[[Ovid]], ''[[Tristia]]'' [https://archive.org/stream/ovidtristiaexpon011949mbp#page/n173/mode/2up 3.7.15]: "the stream of Pegasus" in the English translation; [[Martial]], ''Epigrams'' [https://archive.org/stream/martialepigrams02martiala#page/114/mode/2up 9.58.6]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Walford"/&gt; The [[Muses]] are likewise called Pegasides&lt;ref&gt;[[Ovid]], ''[[Heroides]]'' [https://archive.org/stream/heroidesamores00ovid#page/182/mode/2up 15.27]: "the daughters of Pegasus" in the English translation; [[Propertius]], ''Poems'' [https://archive.org/stream/propertiuswithen00propuoft#page/176/mode/2up 3.1.19]: "Pegasid Muses" in the English translation&lt;/ref&gt; because the spring Hippocrene was sacred to them.&lt;ref name="Smith"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Walford"/&gt; Nymphs in general, if associated with springs and brooks, may be called Pegasides:&lt;ref name="Smith2"&gt;Smith, William (1858);  p 534.&lt;/ref&gt; thus Pegasis, the singular form, is applied by the Roman poet [[Ovid]] as a by-name or adjective to the nymph [[Oenone]], daughter of the river-god [[Cebrenus]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Ovid]], ''[[Heroides]]'' [https://archive.org/stream/L041OvidIHeroidesAmores/L041-Ovid%20I%20Heroides%20Amores#page/n69/mode/2up 5.3]: "the fountain-nymph Oenone" in the English translation; ''Pegasis Oenone'' in the Latin text&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Lempriere"/&gt;

Pegasis is used by the Greek author [[Quintus Smyrnaeus]] as the name of a nymph who had sex with the Trojan prince [[Emathion#Trojan|Emathion]] and gave birth beside the river [[Granicus]] to [[Atymnius]]. The latter was eventually killed by [[Odysseus]] in the [[Trojan War]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Quintus Smyrnaeus]], ''The Fall of Troy'' [https://archive.org/stream/falloftroywithen00quinuoft#page/136/mode/2up 3.300–302]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Parada"&gt;Parada, Carlos (1997) s.v.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6907">[[Image:Nitrate-ion-elpot.png|thumb|right|200px|An [[electric potential|electrostatic potential]] map of the [[nitrate ion]] ([[nitrogen|N]][[oxygen|O]]&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&amp;minus;&lt;/sup&gt;). Areas coloured translucent red, around the outside of the red oxygen atoms themselves, signify the regions of most negative electrostatic potential]]

A '''polyatomic ion''', also known as a '''molecular ion''', is a charged [[chemical species]] ([[ion]]) composed of two or more atoms [[Covalent bond|covalently bonded]] or of a [[complex (chemistry)|metal complex]] that can be considered to be acting as a single unit. The prefix ''poly-'' means "many," in Greek, but even ions of two atoms are commonly referred to as polyatomic. In older literature, a polyatomic ion is also referred to as a '''[[radical (chemistry)|radical]]''', and less commonly, as a '''radical group'''. In contemporary usage, the term radical refers to [[free radical]]s that are (not necessarily charged) species with an unpaired electron. 

An example of a polyatomic ion is the [[hydroxide]] ion; consisting of one oxygen atom and one hydrogen atom, hydroxide has a charge of [[elementary charge|−1]]. Its chemical formula is {{oxygen}}{{hydrogen}}&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt;. An [[ammonium]] ion is made up of one nitrogen atom and four hydrogen atoms: it has a charge of +1, and its chemical formula is {{chem|[[nitrogen|N]][[hydrogen|H]]|4|+}}.

Polyatomic ions are often useful in the context of [[Acid–base reaction|acid-base chemistry]] or in the formation of [[salt (chemistry)|salts]]. A polyatomic ion can often be considered as the [[conjugate acid|conjugate acid/base]] of a neutral molecule. For example, the conjugate base of [[sulfuric acid]] (H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;SO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;) is the polyatomic [[hydrogen sulfate]] anion ({{chem|HSO|4|−}}). The removal of another [[hydron (chemistry)|hydrogen ion]] yields the [[sulfate]] anion ({{chem|SO|4|2−}}).

== Nomenclature of polyatomic anions==

There are two "rules" that can be used for learning the nomenclature of polyatomic anions. First, when the prefix ''bi'' is added to a name, a hydrogen is added to the ion's formula and its charge is increased by 1, the latter being a consequence of the hydrogen ion's +1 charge. An alternative to the ''bi-'' prefix is to use the word hydrogen in its place: the anion derived from {{chem|H|+}} + {{chem|link=carbonate|C|O|3|2-}}, {{chem|link=bicarbonate|H|C|O|3|-}}, can be called either bicarbonate or hydrogen carbonate.

Note that many of the common polyatomic anions are conjugate bases of acids derived from the [[oxide]]s of [[nonmetal|non-metallic]] elements. For example, the [[sulfate]] anion, {{sulfur}}{{oxygen|4}}&lt;sup&gt;2−&lt;/sup&gt;, is derived from {{chem|link=sulfuric acid|H|2|S|O|4}}, which can be regarded as {{chem|link=sulfur trioxide|S|O|3}} + {{chem|link=water|H|2|O}}.

The second rule looks at the number of oxygens in an ion. Consider the [[chlorine]] [[oxyanion|oxoanion]] family:

First, think of the ''-ate'' ion as being the "base" name, in which case the addition of a ''per-'' prefix adds an oxygen. Changing the ''-ate'' suffix to ''-ite'' will reduce the oxygens by one, and keeping the suffix ''-ite'' and adding the prefix ''hypo-'' reduces the number of oxygens by one more. In all situations, the charge is not affected. The naming pattern follows within many different oxyanion series based on a standard root for that particular series. The ''-ite'' has one less oxygen than the ''-ate'', but different ''-ate'' anions might have different numbers of oxygen atoms.

These rules will not work with all polyatomic anions, but they do work with the most common ones (sulfate, phosphate, nitrate, chlorate).

== Examples of common polyatomic ions ==

The following tables give examples of commonly encountered polyatomic ions. Only a few representatives are given, as the number of polyatomic ions encountered in practice is very large. A more complete list may be viewed at List of all polyatomic ions.

'''Pressure retarded osmosis''' ('''PRO''') is a technique to separate a solvent (for example, [[fresh water]]) from a solution that is more concentrated (e.g. [[sea water]]) and also pressurized. A [[semipermeable membrane]] allows the solvent to pass to the concentrated solution side by [[osmosis]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url = http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S037673881300865X | doi=10.1016/j.memsci.2013.10.053 | volume=453 | title=Osmotic power with Pressure Retarded Osmosis: Theory, performance and trends – A review | year=2014 | journal=Journal of Membrane Science | pages=337–358 | author=Helfer Fernanda, Lemckert Charles, Anissimov Yuri G}}&lt;/ref&gt; The technique can be used to generate power from the [[salinity gradient]] energy resulting from the difference in the salt concentration between sea and river water.
In PRO, the [[water potential]] between [[fresh water]] and sea water corresponds to a pressure of 26 [[Bar (unit)|bar]]s. This pressure is equivalent to a column of water ([[hydraulic head]]) 270 meters high.
&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.statkraft.com/energy-sources/osmotic-power/default.aspx How does it work?] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091128105625/http://www.statkraft.com/energy-sources/osmotic-power/default.aspx |date=2009-11-28 }} - [[Statkraft]]&lt;/ref&gt;
However, the optimal working pressure is  only half of this, 11 to 15 bar.
&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tekniikkatalous.fi/doc.te?f_id=993960&amp;plain=true Osmoosivoimalan toiminta]{{dead link|date=March 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }} - ''[[Tekniikka &amp; Talous]]'' {{Fi icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==

This method of generating power was invented by [[Sidney Loeb|Prof. Sidney Loeb]] in 1973 at the [[Ben-Gurion University of the Negev]], [[Beersheba]], Israel.&lt;ref&gt;Israel Patent Application 42658. (July 3, 1973) [http://www.google.com/patents/US3906250 United States patent 3906250]. (Erroneously shows Israel priority as 1974 instead of 1973).
&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2014 researchers verified that 95% of a PRO system's theoretical power output can be produced with a membrane that is half (or less) the size needed for achieving 100%. Output is proportional to the salinity. Desalination yields very salty brine, while treated municipal wastewater has relatively little salt. Combining those streams could produce energy to power both facilities. However, powering an existing wastewater treatment plant by mixing treated wastewater with seawater could require a membrane area of 2.5 million square meters.&lt;ref&gt;[https://online.wsj.com/articles/a-new-kind-of-power-from-salt-water-1409337076]&lt;/ref&gt;

To deal with these membrane requirements, scientists are working on rolled membranes &lt;ref&gt;"A New Kind of Power from Salt Water" Wall St. Journal, August 29–31, 2014 [https://www.wsj.com/articles/a-new-kind-of-power-from-salt-water-1409337076]&lt;/ref&gt; that will take up much less space.

== Testing ==

The world's first osmotic plant with capacity of 10&amp;nbsp;kW was opened by [[Statkraft]] on 24 November 2009 in [[Tofte, Norway|Tofte]], Norway.&lt;ref name=reuters241109&gt;

It is estimated that each year 1600 TWh could be generated worldwide, and 12 TWh in [[Norway]], sufficient to meet 10% of Norway's total demand for electricity.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.statkraft.com/pro/press/Press_releases/2007/Statkraft_to_build_world_s_first_osmotic_power_plant.asp Statkraft to build world's first osmotic power plant] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080915090615/http://www.statkraft.com/pro/press/Press_releases/2007/Statkraft_to_build_world_s_first_osmotic_power_plant.asp |date=2008-09-15 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Elemental abundances.svg|thumb|400px|Relative abundance of the chemical elements in the Earth's upper continental [[Crust (geology)|crust]], on a per-atom basis]]

In [[geochemistry]], [[geophysics]] and [[nuclear physics|geonuclear physics]], '''primordial nuclides''', also known as '''primordial isotopes''', are [[nuclide]]s found on [[Earth]] that have existed in their current form since before [[Formation of the Earth|Earth was formed]]. Primordial nuclides were present in the interstellar medium from which the solar system was formed, and were formed in the [[Big Bang]], by [[nucleosynthesis]] in stars and supernovae followed by mass ejection, by [[cosmic ray spallation]], and potentially from other processes. They are the stable nuclides plus the long-lived fraction of radionuclides surviving in the primordial solar nebula through planet [[accretion (astrophysics)|accretion]] until the present. Only 286 such nuclides are known.

All of the known 253 [[stable nuclide]]s occur as primordial nuclides, plus another 33 nuclides that have [[half-life|half-lives]] long enough to have survived from the formation of the Earth. These 33 primordial radionuclides represent [[isotope]]s&lt;!-- please, do not change to “nuclides”: these are isotopes, not nuclides, what a chemical element has --&gt; of 28 separate [[chemical element|elements]].
[[Cadmium]], [[tellurium]], [[neodymium]], [[samarium]] and [[uranium]] each have two primordial radioisotopes ({{SimpleNuclide|link|Cadmium|113}}, {{SimpleNuclide|link|Cadmium|116}}; {{SimpleNuclide|link|Tellurium|128}}, {{SimpleNuclide|link|Tellurium|130}}; {{SimpleNuclide|link|Neodymium|144}}, {{SimpleNuclide|link|Neodymium|150}}; {{SimpleNuclide|link|Samarium|147}}, {{SimpleNuclide|link|Samarium|148}}; and {{SimpleNuclide|link|Uranium|235}}, {{SimpleNuclide|link|Uranium|238}}).

Because the [[age of the Earth]] is {{val|4.58|e=9|u=years}} (4.6 billion years), this means that the [[half-life]] of the given nuclides must be greater than about {{val|1|e=8|u=years}} (100 million years) for practical considerations. For example, for a nuclide with half-life {{val|6|e=7|u=years}} (60 million years), this means 77&amp;nbsp;half-lives have elapsed, meaning that for each [[Mole (unit)|mole]] ({{val|6.02|e=23|u=atoms}}) of that nuclide being present at the formation of Earth, only 4 atoms remain today.

The four shortest-lived primordial nuclides (i.e. nuclides with shortest half-lives) are {{SimpleNuclide|link|Thorium|232}}, {{SimpleNuclide|link|Uranium|238}}, {{SimpleNuclide|link|Potassium|40}}, and {{SimpleNuclide|link|Uranium|235}}.
These are the 4 nuclides with half-lives comparable to, or less than, the estimated [[age of the universe]]. (In the case of &lt;sup&gt;232&lt;/sup&gt;Th, it has a half life of more than 14 billion years, slightly longer than the age of the universe.)  For a complete list of the 33 known primordial [[radionuclide]]s, including the next 29 with half-lives much ''longer'' than the age of the universe, see the complete list in the section below. For practical purposes, nuclides with half-lives much longer than the age of the universe may be treated as if they really were stable. &lt;sup&gt;232&lt;/sup&gt;Th and &lt;sup&gt;238&lt;/sup&gt;U have half-lives long enough that their decay is limited over geological time scales; &lt;sup&gt;40&lt;/sup&gt;K and &lt;sup&gt;235&lt;/sup&gt;U have shorter half-lives and are hence severely depleted, but are still long-lived enough to persist significantly in nature.

The next longest-living nuclide after the end of the list given in the table is {{SimpleNuclide|link|Plutonium|244}}, with a half-life of {{val|8.08|e=7|u=years}}. It has been reported to exist in nature as a primordial nuclide, although later studies could not detect it.&lt;ref name="PU244"&gt;

Considering the likely initial abundances of these nuclides, possibly measurable quantities of &lt;sup&gt;244&lt;/sup&gt;Pu and &lt;sup&gt;146&lt;/sup&gt;Sm should persist today, while they should not for &lt;sup&gt;92&lt;/sup&gt;Nb and all shorter-lived nuclides. Nuclides such as &lt;sup&gt;92&lt;/sup&gt;Nb that were present in the primordial solar nebula but have long since decayed away completely are termed [[extinct radionuclide]]s if they have no other means of being regenerated.&lt;ref&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although it is estimated that about 33 primordial nuclides are [[Radioactive decay|radioactive]] (list below), it becomes very difficult to determine the exact total number of radioactive primordials, because the total number of stable nuclides is uncertain. There exist many extremely long-lived nuclides whose half-lives are still unknown. For example, it is predicted theoretically that all [[isotopes of tungsten]], including those indicated by even the most modern empirical methods to be stable, must be radioactive and can decay by [[alpha emission]], but {{as of|2013|lc=on}} this could only be measured experimentally for {{SimpleNuclide|link|Tungsten|180}}.&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite web
 |title=Interactive Chart of Nuclides (Nudat2.5)
 |url=http://www.nndc.bnl.gov/nudat2/
 |publisher=[[National Nuclear Data Center]]
 |accessdate=2009-06-22
}}&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, all four primordial [[isotopes of lead]] are expected to decay to [[mercury (element)|mercury]], but the predicted half-lives are so long (some exceeding 10&lt;sup&gt;100&lt;/sup&gt; years) that this can hardly be observed in the near future. Nevertheless, the number of nuclides with half-lives so long that they cannot be measured with present instruments—and are considered from this viewpoint to be [[stable nuclide]]s—is limited. Even when a "stable" nuclide is found to be radioactive, the fact merely moves it from the ''stable'' to the ''unstable'' list of primordial nuclides, and the total number of primordial nuclides remains unchanged.

Because '''primordial chemical elements''' often consist of more than one primordial isotope&lt;!-- please, do not change to "nuclide": these are isotopes, not nuclides, what a chemical element has --&gt;, there are only 83 distinct primordial [[chemical element]]s. Of these, 80 have at least one [[observationally stable]] isotope and three additional primordial elements have only radioactive isotopes ([[bismuth]], [[thorium]], and uranium).

==Naturally occurring nuclides that are not primordial==
Some unstable isotopes which occur naturally (such as {{SimpleNuclide|link|Carbon|14}}, {{SimpleNuclide|link|Hydrogen|3}}, and {{SimpleNuclide|link|Plutonium|239}}) are not primordial, as they must be constantly regenerated. This occurs by [[cosmic radiation]] (in the case of [[cosmogenic nuclide]]s such as {{SimpleNuclide|Carbon|14}} and {{SimpleNuclide|Hydrogen|3}}), or (rarely) by such processes as geonuclear transmutation ([[neutron capture]] of uranium in the case of {{SimpleNuclide|Neptunium|237}} and {{SimpleNuclide|Plutonium|239}}). Other examples of common naturally occurring but non-primordial nuclides are isotopes of [[radon]], [[polonium]], and [[radium]], which are all [[radiogenic nuclide]] daughters of uranium decay and are found in uranium ores. A similar radiogenic series is derived from the long-lived radioactive primordial nuclide [[thorium-232|&lt;sup&gt;232&lt;/sup&gt;Th]]. All of such nuclides have shorter half-lives than their parent radioactive primordial nuclides. Some other [[:wikt:geogenic|geogenic]] nuclides do not occur in the [[decay chain]]s of &lt;sup&gt;232&lt;/sup&gt;Th, &lt;sup&gt;235&lt;/sup&gt;U, or &lt;sup&gt;238&lt;/sup&gt;U but can still fleetingly occur naturally as products of the [[spontaneous fission]] of one of these three long-lived nuclides, such as [[tin-126|&lt;sup&gt;126&lt;/sup&gt;Sn]], which makes up about 10&lt;sup&gt;−14&lt;/sup&gt; of all natural [[tin]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://accelconf.web.cern.ch/accelconf/HIAT2009/papers/g-07.pdf |title=Research on measurement of &lt;sup&gt;126&lt;/sup&gt;Sn by AMS |author=H.-T. Shen et al.|website= accelconf.web.cern.ch}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Primordial elements ==
There are 253 stable primordial nuclides and 33 radioactive primordial nuclides, but only 80 primordial stable ''elements'' (1 through 82, i.e. hydrogen through lead, exclusive of 43 and 61, [[technetium]] and [[promethium]] respectively) and three radioactive primordial ''elements'' (bismuth, thorium, and uranium). Bismuth's half-life is so long that it is often classed with the 80 primordial stable elements instead, since its radioactivity is not a cause for serious concern. The number of elements is fewer than the number of nuclides, because many of the primordial elements are represented by multiple [[isotopes]]. See [[chemical element]] for more information.

== Naturally occurring stable nuclides ==

As noted, these number about 253. For a list, see the article [[list of elements by stability of isotopes]]. For a complete list noting which of the "stable" 253 nuclides may be in some respect unstable, see [[list of nuclides]] and [[stable nuclide]]. These questions do not impact the question of whether a nuclide is primordial, since all "nearly stable" nuclides, with half-lives longer than the age of the universe, are primordial also.

==List of 33 radioactive primordial nuclides and measured half-lives==

These 33 primordial nuclides represent radioisotopes of 28 distinct chemical elements (cadmium, neodymium, samarium, tellurium, and uranium each have two primordial radioisotopes). The radionuclides are listed in order of stability, with the longest half-life beginning the list. These radionuclides in many cases are so nearly stable that they compete for abundance with stable isotopes of their respective elements. 
For three chemical elements, a very long lived radioactive primordial nuclide is found to be the most abundant nuclide for an element that also has a stable nuclide. These unusual elements are [[tellurium]], [[indium]], and [[rhenium]].
&lt;!---In one case a radionuclide ([[Isotopes of tellurium|Te-123]]) has been added and then removed from the table, as its natural decay has been reported, then re-reported as unconfirmed. In any case, Te-123's half life is longer than {{val|5|e=19|u=years}}, and probably much longer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Alessandrello |first1=A. |last2=Arnaboldi |first2=C. |last3=Brofferio |first3=C. |last4=Capelli |first4=S. |last5=Cremonesi |first5=O. |last6=Fiorini |first6=E. |last7=Nucciotti |first7=A. |last8=Pavan |first8=M. |last9=Pessina |first9=G. |last10=Pirro |first10=S. |last11=Previtali |first11=E. |last12=Sisti |first12=M. |last13=Vanzini |first13=M. |last14=Zanotti |first14=L. |last15=Giuliani |first15=A. |last16=Pedretti |first16=M. |last17=Bucci |first17=C. |last18=Pobes |first18=C. |year=2003 |title=New limits on naturally occurring electron capture of &lt;sup&gt;123&lt;/sup&gt;Te |journal=Physical Review C |volume=67 |issue=1 |pages=014323 |arxiv=hep-ex/0211015 |doi=10.1103/PhysRevC.67.014323}}&lt;/ref&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt; ---&gt;

The longest has a half-life of {{val|2.2|e=24|u=years}}, which is 160 trillion times the [[age of the Universe]]. Only four of these 33 nuclides have half-lives shorter than, or equal to, the age of the universe. Most of the remaining 29 have half-lives much longer. The shortest-lived primordial isotope, &lt;sup&gt;235&lt;/sup&gt;U, has a half-life of 704 million years, about one sixth of the age of the Earth and [[age of the Solar System|Solar System]].

'''''Pterocarpus santalinus''''', with the common names '''red sanders''', '''red sandalwood''', and '''saunderswood''', is a species of ''[[Pterocarpus]]'' [[endemism|endemic]] to the southern [[Eastern Ghats]] mountain range of [[South India]].&lt;ref name=iucn&gt;[http://www.iucnredlist.org/details/full/32104/0 IUCN Report: ''Pterocarpus santalinus'' (Almug, Red Sandalwood, Saunderswood)]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=ildis&gt;International Legume Database &amp; Information Service: [http://www.ildis.org/LegumeWeb?version~10.01&amp;LegumeWeb&amp;genus~Pterocarpus&amp;species~santalinus ''Pterocarpus santalinus'']&lt;/ref&gt; This tree is valued for the rich red color of its wood. The wood is not aromatic. The tree is not to be confused with the aromatic [[Sandalwood|''Santalum'' sandalwood]] trees that grow natively in South India.

[[File:Pterocarpus santalinus 04.JPG|thumb|right|Pterocarpus santalinus leaf]]

''Pterocarpus santalinus'' is a light-demanding small [[tree]], growing to {{convert|8|m|ft}} tall with a trunk 50–150&amp;nbsp;cm diameter. It is fast-growing when young, reaching {{convert|5|m|ft}} tall in three years, even on degraded soils. It is not frost tolerant, being killed by temperatures of &amp;minus;1&amp;nbsp;°C.

The [[leaf|leaves]] are alternate, 3–9&amp;nbsp;cm long, trifoliate with three leaflets.

The [[flower]]s are produced in short [[raceme]]s. The [[fruit]] is a [[legume|pod]] 6–9&amp;nbsp;cm long containing one or two [[seed]]s.&lt;ref&gt;FAO Ecocrop: [http://ecocrop.fao.org/gppis.exe$EC_Show?Host=9049 ''Pterocarpus santalinus'']{{dead link|date=April 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Auroville: [http://tcdc.undp.org/sie/experiences/vol3/Wasteland%20reclamation.pdf Wasteland reclamation through rehabilitation of eroded soil (pdf file)] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070623115710/http://tcdc.undp.org/sie/experiences/vol3/Wasteland%20reclamation.pdf |date=2007-06-23 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Uses==

===Timber===
The [[wood]] has historically been valued in [[China]], particularly during the [[Qing Dynasty]] periods, and is referred to in Chinese as ''zitan'' ([[wikt:紫檀|紫檀]]) and spelt tzu-t'an by earlier western authors such as [[Gustav Ecke]], who introduced classical Chinese hardwood furniture to the west.&lt;ref name=ref1&gt;http://www.chinese-furniture.com/cgi-bin/ccf.cgi?stt=stp&amp;pgn=newsletter_archive/newsletter_2.html&amp;id= Chinese Furniture.com newsletter; Volume 1, Number 2; Accessed 2007-04-05&lt;/ref&gt; An exquisite chair made of red sandalwood can be seen today in China's [[Forbidden City]] in [[Beijing]], inside the ''[[Hall of Supreme Harmony]]'', and once used by the emperors of the Qing Dynasty.

Due to its slow growth and rarity, [[furniture]] made from zitan is difficult to find and can be expensive.&lt;ref name=ref2&gt;http://www.wctg.net/zitan.html; Accessed 2007-04-06&lt;/ref&gt; It has been one of the most prized woods for millennia.

In India sandalwood is one main and lucrative market for smugglers, as a high price is paid for this wood in China. Since the exporting of sandalwood is illegal in India, the underground market is growing and there are a number of arrests every year of those trying to smuggle this wood to China.

The other form of ''zitan'' is from the species ''[[Dalbergia luovelii]]'', ''[[Dalbergia maritima]]'', and ''[[Dalbergia normandi]]'', all similar species named in trade as bois de rose or violet rosewood which when cut are bright crimson purple changing to dark purple again. It has a fragrant scent when worked.&lt;ref name=ref1/&gt;

===Shamisen===

Red sandalwood has been used for making the bridge and also the neck of the Japanese musical instrument [[Shamisen]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=sxjQAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA56-IA8&amp;lpg=PA56-IA8#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false], Japanese Music and Musical Instruments&lt;/ref&gt;

===Medicinal values===
''Pterocarpus santalinus'' is used in traditional herbal medicine as an antipyretic, anti-inflammatory, anthelmintic, tonic, hemorrhage, dysentery, aphrodisiac, anti-hyperglycaemic and diaphoretic.&lt;ref&gt;http://shodhganga.inflibnet.ac.in:8080/jspui/bitstream/10603/37317/9/09_chapter%203.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | url = https://link.springer.com/article/10.3839%2Fjksabc.2011.076 | doi=10.3839/jksabc.2011.076|journal=Journal of the Korean Society for Applied Biological Chemistry|date=August 2011|volume=54| issue= 4| pages= 495–500| title = ''Pterocarpus santalinus'' Linn. f. (Rath handun): A review of its botany, uses, phytochemistry and pharmacology}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Grading of red sandalwood===
[[File:SandalwoodChessPieces.jpg|right|thumb|[[Chess piece]]s in red sandalwood]]
Red sandalwood grown on the [[shale]] subsoils, at altitudes around {{convert|750|m|ft}}, and in semi-arid climatic conditions gives a distinctive wavy grain margin. Lumber pieces with the wavy grain margin are graded as "A" grade. Red sandalwood with wavy grain margins sells at higher prices than the standard wood.

==Conservation status==
''Pterocarpus santalinus'' was listed as an Endangered species by the [[IUCN]], because of [[overexploitation]] for its timber in [[South India]]; however, it was later reclassified to [[Near-threatened species|Near Threatened]] in 2018, as the scale of this loss is not properly known.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation
|url=http://www.iucnredlist.org/apps/redlist/details/32104/0 
|publisher=IUCN 
|title=Red List of Threatened Species: ''Pterocarpus santalinus''
}}&lt;/ref&gt;
It is also listed in the appendix II of the [[CITES]], which means that a certificate is required in order to export it, that should only be granted if the trade is not detrimental to the survival of the species.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation

The '''Sacred Rock of Hunza ''' is carved rock as well as a cultural heritage site in [[Gilgit-Baltistan]], [[Pakistan]]. The carvings on the rock dates back to the 1st Millennium AD. The rock is on a top of a hill which lies in east to the [[Hunza River]]. The site is on the main Karakoram Highway (KKH) in between Ganish village and Attabad Lake.  The rock is divided into two parts, once there used to be some Buddhist shelter caves which fell over time. The rock is one of the major tourist attractions in Gilgit-Baltistan.&lt;ref name="Sacred Rock"/&gt;

The sacred rock is located in place called '''Haldeikish''' near to the small town of Karimabad in [[Hunza Valley]]. The site is on top of a Hill which is at the left bank of the river Hunza.&lt;ref name="Sacred Rock"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://unesdoc.unesco.org/images/0004/000420/042046eb.pdf |title= UNESDoc (UNESCO)|publisher=unesdoc.unesco.org |date= |accessdate=2014-07-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; The rock is 30 feet high and 200 yards long. It is easily accessible from the [[Karakoram Highway]] which connects Pakistan with [[China]]. It is an isolated rock which is further divided into two portions.

==Specifications==

The Sacred Rock is divided into two portions, an upper portion and a lower one. Both the portions carry carvings on them which are basically inscriptions and images from Pre-Historic era. There used to be many Buddhist shelter caves in ancient times which later collapsed or fell over the time.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.lonelyplanet.com/pakistan/karakoram-highway/ganish/sights/historic/sacred-rocks-hunza&lt;/ref&gt;

===Upper Portion===

The upper portion of the rock consist of inscriptions which are carved in Sogdian, Kharosthi, Brahmi, Sarada and Proto Sarada languages. The  names of the Emperors of the '''Kushana Empire''' appear in these inscriptions as well as the names of other Emperors from the Empires of '''Kanishka''' and '''Huvishka'''. The name of the Trukha King '''Ramadusa''' is also mentioned in inscriptions which are carved in Brahmi language.&lt;ref name="Sacred Rock"/&gt;

===Lower Portion===

The lower portion is engraved by the images of [[Ibex]]es. These ibexes are shown in different situations, including being hunted. The carvings also contain Horned-Human deities playing with the ibexes. The carvings of the Ibexes are a proof of the ibex being an animal which holds cultural importance to [[Buddhists]] as well as to the region in ancient times. One of the carvings also shows the image of an ancient Chinese King. Some carvings show a Tibetan styled Stupa.&lt;ref name="Sacred Rock"/&gt;

==Preservation==

The Sacred Rock of Hunza is a Cultural Heritage Site of Pakistan and is currently well preserved but still some the carvings carrying inscriptions are effected due to aging. There were many Buddhist shelter caves which fell over time and no more exist. Commissioner of Northern Areas of Pakistan and Director of Archaeology are responsible for the preservation of the site, both acting under the [[Government of Pakistan]]. Due to recent flooding in [[Hunza River]] the site faces extreme danger in future.&lt;ref name="Sacred Rock"/&gt;

{{memory types}}

The '''Selectron''' was an early form of digital [[computer memory]] developed by [[Jan A. Rajchman]] and his group at the [[RCA|Radio Corporation of America]] (RCA) under the direction of [[Vladimir K. Zworykin]].  It was a [[vacuum tube]] that stored digital data as electrostatic charges using technology similar to the [[Williams tube]] storage device.  The team was never able to produce a commercially viable form of Selectron before [[magnetic-core memory]] became almost universal, and it remains practically unknown today.

== Development ==
Development of Selectron started in 1946 at the behest of [[John von Neumann]] of the [[Institute for Advanced Study]],&lt;ref&gt;Metropolis N, Rajchman, JA (1980) Early Research on Computers at RCA ''A History of Computing in the Twentieth Century'' pp 465-469, {{ISBN|0-12-491650-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; who was in the midst of designing the [[IAS machine]] and was looking for a new form of high-speed memory.



Their original design concept had a capacity of 4096 bits, with a planned production of 200 by the end of 1946. They found the device to be much more difficult to build than expected, and they were still not available by the middle of 1948. As development dragged on, the IAS machine was forced to switch to Williams tubes for storage, and the primary customer for Selectron disappeared.

RCA continued work on the concept, re-designing it for a smaller 256-bit capacity. The 256-bit Selectron was projected to cost about $500 each when in full production. While they were more reliable and faster than the Williams tube, the cost and the lack of availability meant they were used only in one computer: the RAND Corporation's [[JOHNNIAC]].&lt;ref&gt;Greuenberger JF (1968) [http://www.rand.org/pubs/research_memoranda/RM5654/ ''The History of the JOHNNIAC''] pp 25-27&lt;/ref&gt;

Both the Selectron and the Williams tube were superseded in the market by the compact and cost-effective magnetic-core memory, in the early 1950s.

==Principle of operation==

===Electrostatic storage===
The Williams tube was an example of a general class of [[cathode ray tube]] (CRT) devices known as [[storage tube]]s.

The primary function of a conventional CRT is to display an image by lighting [[phosphor]] using a beam of [[electron]]s fired at it from an [[electron gun]] at the back of the tube. The target point of the beam is steered around the front of the tube though the use of deflection magnets or electrostatic plates.

Storage tubes were based on CRTs, sometimes unmodified. They relied on two normally undesirable principles of phosphor used in the tubes. One was that when electrons from the CRT's electron gun struck the phosphor to light it, some of the electrons "stuck" to the tube and caused a localized [[Static electricity|static electric]] charge to build up. The second was that the phosphor, like many materials, also released new electrons when struck by an electron beam, a process known as [[secondary emission]].{{sfn|Knoll &amp; Kazan|1952|p=1}}

Secondary emission had the useful feature that the rate of electron release was significantly non-linear. When a voltage was applied that crossed a certain threshold, the rate of emission increased dramatically. This caused the lit spot to rapidly decay, which also caused any stuck electrons to be released as well. Visual systems used this process to erase the display, causing any stored pattern to rapidly fade. For computer uses it was the rapid release of the stuck charge that allowed it to be used for storage.

In the Williams tube, the electron gun at the back of an otherwise typical CRT is used to deposit a series of small patterns representing a 1 or 0 on the phosphor in a grid representing memory locations. To read the display, the beam scanned the tube again, this time set to a voltage very close to that of the secondary emission threshold. The patterns were selected to bias the tube very slightly positive or negative. When the stored static electricity was added to the voltage of the beam, the total voltage either crossed the secondary emission threshold or didn't. If it crossed the threshold, a burst of electrons was released as the dot decayed. This burst was read capacitively on a metal plate placed just in front of the display side of the tube.{{sfn|Eckert|1998|pp=19-20}}

There were four general classes of storage tubes; the "surface redistribution type" represented by the Williams tube, the "barrier grid" system, which was unsuccessfully commercialized by RCA as the [[Radechon tube]], the "sticking potential" type which was not used commercially, and the "holding beam" concept, of which the Selectron is a specific example.{{sfn|Eckert|1998|p=18}}

===Holding beam concept===
In the most basic implementation, the holding beam tube uses three electron guns; one for writing, one for reading, and a third "holding gun" that maintains the pattern. The general operation is very similar to the Williams tube in concept. The main difference was the holding gun, which fired continually and unfocussed so it covered the entire storage area on the phosphor. This caused the phosphor to be continually charged to a selected voltage, somewhat below that of the secondary emission threshold.{{sfn|Eckert|1998|p=21}}

Writing was accomplished by firing the writing gun at low voltage in a fashion similar to the Williams tube, adding a further voltage to the phosphor. Thus the storage pattern was the slight difference between two voltages stored on the tube, typically only a few tens of volts different.{{sfn|Eckert|1998|p=21}} In comparison, the Williams tube used much higher voltages, producing a pattern that could only be stored for a short period before it decayed below readability.

Reading was accomplished by scanning the reading gun across the storage area. This gun was set to a voltage that would cross the secondary emission threshold for the entire display. If the scanned area held the holding gun potential a certain number of electrons would be released, if it held the writing gun potential the number would be higher. The electrons were read on a grid of fine wires placed behind the display, making the system entirely self-contained - the Williams tube's read plate was in front of the tube, and required continual mechanical adjustment to work properly.{{sfn|Eckert|1998|p=21}} The grid also had the advantage of breaking the display into spots without requiring the tight focus of the Williams system.

General operation was the same as the Williams system, but the holding concept had two major advantages. One was that it operated at much lower voltage differences and was thus able to safely store data for a longer period of time. The other was that the same deflection magnet drivers could be sent to several electron guns to produce a single larger device with no increase in complexity of the electronics.

== Design ==
The Selectron further modified the basic holding gun concept through the use of individual metal eyelets that were used to store additional charge in a more predictable and long-lasting fashion.

Unlike a CRT where the electron gun is a single point source consisting of a filament and single charged accelerator, in the Selectron the "gun" is a plate and the accelerator is a grid of wires (thus borrowing some design notes from the barrier-grid tube). Switching circuits allow voltages to be applied to the wires to turn them on or off. When the gun fires through the eyelets, it is slightly defocussed. Some of the electrons strike the eyelet and deposit a charge on it.

The original 4096-bit Selectron&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Rajchman | first1 = JA | year = 1947 | title = The Selectron - A Tube for Selective Electrostatic Storage | url = http://www.rcaselectron.com/MTAC1947Raj.pdf | format = PDF | journal = Mathematical Tables and Other Aids to Computation | volume = 2 | issue = 20| pages = 359–361 | doi=10.2307/2002239}}&lt;/ref&gt; was a {{convert|10|in|mm|adj=mid|-long}} by {{convert|3|in|mm|adj=mid|-diameter}} vacuum tube configured as 1024 by 4 bits.  It had an indirectly heated [[cathode]] running up the middle, surrounded by two separate sets of wires&amp;nbsp;— one radial, one axial&amp;nbsp;— forming a cylindrical grid array, and finally a dielectric storage material coating on the inside of four segments of an enclosing metal cylinder, called the ''signal plates''.  The bits were stored as discrete regions of charge on the smooth surfaces of the signal plates.

The two sets of orthogonal grid wires were normally "biased" slightly positive, so that the electrons from the cathode could flow through the grid and reach the dielectric. The continuous flow of electrons allowed the stored charge to be continuously regenerated by the [[secondary emission]] of electrons. To select a bit to be read from or written to, all but two adjacent wires on each of the two grids were biased negative, allowing current to flow to the dielectric at one location only.

[[Image:Selectron256Xsection.jpg|thumb|left|300px|Selectron cross section]]

Writing was accomplished by selecting a bit, as above, and then sending a pulse of potential, either positive or negative, to the signal plate. With a bit selected, electrons would be pulled onto (with a positive potential) or pushed from (negative potential) the dielectric. When the bias on the grid was dropped, the electrons were trapped on the dielectric as a spot of static electricity.

To read from the device, a bit location was selected and a pulse sent from the cathode. If the dielectric for that bit contained a charge, the electrons would be pushed off the dielectric and read as a brief pulse of current in the signal plate. No such pulse meant that the dielectric must not have held a charge.

The smaller capacity 256-bit (128 by 2 bits) "production" device&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Rajchman | first1 = JA | year = 1951 | title = The Selective Electrostatic Storage Tube | url = | journal = RCA Review | volume = 12 | issue = 1| pages = 53–97 }}&lt;/ref&gt; was in a similar vacuum-tube envelope. It was built with two storage arrays of discrete "eyelets" on a rectangular plate, separated by a row of eight cathodes. The pin count was reduced from 44 for the 4096-bit device down to 31 pins and two coaxial signal output connectors.  This version included visible green phosphors in each eyelet{{citation needed|date=October 2017}} so that the bit status could also be read by eye.

==World War I==
[[Image:FT-17-argonne-1918.gif|thumb|left|US Army operating Renault FT tanks]]

As the American army did not have tanks of its own, the French two-man [[Renault FT]] Light Tank was used by US in the later stages of [[World War I]]. It was cheap and well-suited for mass production, and in addition to its traversable turret another innovative feature of the FT was its engine located at the rear. This pattern, with the gun located in a mounted turret and rear engine, became the standard for most succeeding tanks across the world even to this day.

The '''M1917''' was a US tank accepted by the army in October 1918 and is primarily based on the plans of the French [[Renault FT]]. The crew, a driver and gunner, were separated from the engine by a bulkhead. Steel idler wheels replaced the wooden idlers fitted to French examples. Approximately 64 of the M1917 were built before the end of World War I and 10 were sent to Europe, but too late to be used in combat. After the war Van Dorn Iron Works, the Maxwell Motor Company, and the C.L. Best Tractor Company created 950 more. 374 had cannons and 526 had machine guns and 50 were signal (radio) tanks. A later modification, the M1917A1, was a lengthened, rebuilt, updated version compared to the French one, having a 100&amp;nbsp;hp Franklin engine and an electric self-starter rather than a crank starter.&lt;ref&gt;The Renault FT Light Tank; S. Zaloga&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Treat 'Em Rough! Capt. Dale E. Wilson&lt;/ref&gt;

U.S. troops also used the British Heavy Tanks Mk V and Mk V* (pronounced "Mark Five" and "Mark Five Star"). A battalion trained in England and saw action in France in the last six weeks of the War. On a small number of occasions, U.S. troops were supported by tank units of the French Army operating [[Schneider CA1|Schneider]] and [[Saint-Chamond (tank)|Saint-Chamond]] machines.

====World War II====
[[Marmon-Herrington CTLS|Marmon-Herrington tanks]] that could not be delivered because of the fall of the Dutch East Indies were taken over by the US. The CTLS-4TAC and -4TAY tanks were redesignated Light Tank T14 and T16 respectively. They were used for training, some were used in Alaska and by the US Marines. The CTLS-4TAC has the turret offset to the left, the CTLS-4TAY to the right.

===M3/5 Stuart===
====World War II====
[[File:M3-Stuart-Fort-Knox-3.jpg|thumb|right|M3 Stuart at Fort Knox, Kentucky, used for training.]]
The [[M3 Stuart|Stuart]] was an upgrade of the [[M2 Light Tank]].

The initial upgrade was designated the M3 Stuart and had thicker [[vehicle armour|armor]], modified suspension and a 37mm&amp;nbsp;mm gun. Production of the M3 and later the M5 Stuart started in March 1941 and continued until October 1943 with a total of 25,000 produced.

An upgrade of the M3, which was initially called M4 but later redesignated the M5, was developed with improved engines and produced through 1942. The M5 featured a redesigned hull and driver's hatches moved to the top. The M5 gradually replaced the M3 in production from 1942 and was in turn succeeded by the [[M24 Chaffee|Light Tank M24]] in 1944.

The [[British Army]] was the first to use the M3 in combat. In November 1941, some 170 Stuarts took part in [[Operation Crusader]], with poor results.

Although the high losses suffered by Stuart-equipped units during the operation had more to do with better tactics and training of the enemy than superiority of enemy tanks in the [[North African campaign]], the operation revealed that the M3 had several technical faults. Mentioned in the British complaints were the 37&amp;nbsp;mm gun, a limited range and poor internal layout. The two-man turret crew was a significant weakness, and some British units tried to fight with three-man turret crews. Crews liked its high speed and mechanical reliability.

From the summer of 1942, when enough US medium tanks had been received, the British usually kept Stuarts out of tank-to-tank combat. M3s, M3A3s, and M5s continued in British service until the end of the war, but British armor units had a smaller proportion of these light tanks than US units.

The other major [[Lend-Lease]] recipient of the M3, the [[Soviet Union]], was even less happy with the tank, considering it undergunned, underarmored, likely to catch fire, and too sensitive to fuel quality. The narrow tracks were highly unsuited to operation in winter conditions, as they resulted in high ground pressures that sunk the tank. However, the Stuart was superior to early-war Soviet light tanks such as the [[T-60]], which were often underpowered and possessed even lighter armament than the Stuart. In 1943, the [[Red Army]] tried out the M5 and decided that the upgraded design wasn't much better than the M3. Being less desperate than in 1941, the Soviets turned down an American offer to supply the M5. M3s continued in Red Army service at least until 1944.

In [[United States Army|US Army]] service, the M3 first saw combat in the Philippines. Two battalions, comprising the Provisional Tank Group fought in the Bataan peninsula campaign. When the American army joined the [[North African Campaign]] in late 1942, Stuart units still formed a large part of its armor strength.

After the disastrous [[Battle of the Kasserine Pass]] the US quickly disbanding most of their light tank [[battalion]]s and subordinating the Stuarts to medium tank battalions performing the traditional cavalry missions of scouting and screening. For the rest of the war, most US tank battalions had three [[company (military unit)|companies]] of [[M4 Sherman]]s and one company of M3s or M5/M5A1s.

In the European theater, Allied light tanks had to be given cavalry and infantry fire support roles since their main cannon armament could not compete with heavier enemy AFVs. However, the Stuart was still effective in combat in the [[Asiatic-Pacific Theater|Pacific Theater]], as [[List of Japanese armoured fighting vehicles of World War II|Japanese tanks]] were both relatively rare and were generally much weaker than even Allied light tanks. [[Imperial Japanese Army#The Second World War|Japanese infantrymen]] were poorly equipped with [[anti-tank]] weapons and tended to attack tanks using close-assault tactics. In this environment, the Stuart was only moderately more vulnerable than medium tanks. In addition, the poor terrain and roads common to the theatre were unsuitable for the much heavier M4 medium tanks, and so initially, only light armor could be deployed. Heavier M4s were eventually brought to overcome heavily entrenched positions, though the Stuart continued to serve in a combat capacity until the end of the war.

The US liquidated its Stuarts when it got sufficient numbers of [[M24 Chaffee]]s but the tank remained in service until the end of the war and well after. In addition to the United States, United Kingdom and Soviet Union, who were the primary users, it was also used by [[France]] and [[China]].

===M24 Chaffee===
====World War II====
[[File:M-24 Chaffee Light Tank 01.jpg|thumb|right|M24 Chaffee on display]]
In April 1943 the government started work on the M24 Chaffee, designated '''Light Tank T24''' as a replacement for the [[Stuart tank|M3/M5 Stuart]] after the original replacement, the M7, was rejected in March. Every effort was made to keep the weight of the vehicle under 20 tons. The [[vehicle armour|armor]] was kept light, and a lightweight 75&amp;nbsp;mm gun was developed. The design also featured wider tracks and [[torsion bar]] suspension. It had relatively low silhouette and a three-man turret. In mid-October the first pilot vehicle was delivered and production began in 1944 under the designation '''Light Tank M24'''. 4,730 were produced by the time production was stopped in August 1945.

The first thirty-four M24s reached Europe in November 1944 and were issued to the U.S. 2nd Cavalry Group (Mechanized) in France. These were then issued to F Company, 2nd Cavalry Reconnaissance Battalion and F Company, 42nd Cavalry Reconnaissance Battalion which each received seventeen M24s. During the [[Battle of the Bulge]] in December 1944, these units and their new tanks were rushed to the southern sector; two of the M24s were detached to serve with the 740th Tank [[Battalion]] of the [[First United States Army|U.S. First Army]].

The M24 started to enter widespread issue in December 1944 but they were slow in reaching the front-line combat units. By the end of the war many armored divisions were still mainly equipped with the M5. Some armored divisions did not receive their first M24s until the war was over.

Reports were generally positive. Crews liked the improved off-road performance and reliability, but were most appreciative of the 75&amp;nbsp;mm main gun, as a vast improvement over the 37&amp;nbsp;mm. The M24 was still not up to the challenge of fighting tanks, however, the bigger gun at least gave it a chance to defend itself. Its light armor made it vulnerable in tank vs. tank actions.

The M24s contribution to winning the war was insignificant, as too few arrived too late to replace the M5s of the armored divisions.

==Medium tanks==
===M4 Sherman===
[[File:Armoured Ramp Carrier.jpg|thumb|right|Sherman tank using a Churchill 'Ark' armored ramp carrier]]

====World War II====
The U.S. Army designed the M4 as a replacement for the [[M3 Lee|M3 Medium]]. The designated goals were to produce a fast, dependable medium tank able to support infantry, provide breakthrough striking capacity, and defeat any tank currently in use by the [[Axis powers of World War II|Axis nations]]. In April 1941 the U.S. Armored Force Board chose the simplest of five designs. Known as the T6, the design was a modified M3 hull and chassis, carrying a newly designed turret mounting the Lee's main gun. This became the Sherman.&lt;ref&gt;[http://afvdb.50megs.com/usa/index.html AFV database]&lt;/ref&gt;

The prototype M4 was completed in September 1941. The T6 became standardized as the M4, and production after modifications began in October 1941.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wizards.com/default.asp?x=ah/article/ah20050729b Opening Salvo: M4A1 Sherman Tank by Michael J. Canavan]&lt;/ref&gt;

The U.S. Army had seven main sub-designations for M4 variants during the production period: M4, M4A1, M4A2, M4A3, M4A4, M4A5, and M4A6. These designations were manufactured concurrently at different locations.

While most Shermans ran on gasoline, the M4A2 and M4A6 had diesel engines: the M4A2 with a pair of [[General Motors|GMC]] 6-71 straight six engines,&lt;ref&gt;Berndt, Thomas. ''Standard Catalog of U.S. Military Vehicles'' (Krause Publications, 1993), pp.192-3.&lt;/ref&gt; the M4A6 a [[Caterpillar Inc.|Caterpillar]] RD1820 [[Radial engine#Diesel radials|radial]].&lt;ref&gt;Berndt, pp.192-3.&lt;/ref&gt; These, plus the M4A4 which used the [[Chrysler A57 multibank]] engine, were mostly supplied to Allied countries under Lend-Lease.&lt;ref&gt;Berndt, pp.190 &amp; 192-3.&lt;/ref&gt; "M4" can refer specifically to the initial sub-type with its Continental radial engine, or generically, to the entire family of seven Sherman sub-types, depending on context. Many details of production, shape, strength, and performance improved throughout production without a change to the tank's basic model number; more durable suspension units, safer "wet" (W) ammunition stowage, and stronger armor arrangements, such as the M4 Composite, which had a cast front hull section mated to a welded rear hull. British nomenclature differed from that employed by the U.S.

Early Shermans mounted a [[75 mm Gun (US)|75&amp;nbsp;mm medium-velocity general-purpose gun]]. Although Ordnance began work on the [[T20 Medium Tank|Medium Tank T20]] as a Sherman replacement, ultimately the Army decided to minimize production disruption by incorporating elements of other tank designs into Sherman production. Later M4A1, M4A2, and M4A3 models received the larger T23 turret, with a high-velocity [[76 mm gun M1]], which reduced the number of HE and smoke rounds carried and increased the number of anti-tank rounds. Later, the M4 and M4A3 were factory-produced with a 105&amp;nbsp;mm howitzer and a new distinctive [[mantlet]] in the original turret. The first standard-production 76&amp;nbsp;mm gun Sherman was an M4A1, accepted in January 1944, and the first standard-production 105&amp;nbsp;mm howitzer Sherman was an M4 accepted in February 1944.

In June–July 1944, the Army accepted a limited run of 254 M4A3E2 ''Jumbo'' Shermans, which had very thick armor, and the 75&amp;nbsp;mm gun in a new, heavier T23-style turret, in order to assault fortifications. The M4A3 was the first to be factory-produced with the HVSS (horizontal volute spring suspension) suspension with wider tracks to distribute weight, and the smooth ride of the HVSS with its experimental E8 designation led to the nickname ''Easy Eight'' for Shermans so equipped. Both the Americans and the British developed a wide array of special attachments for the Sherman; few saw combat, and most remained experimental. Those which saw action included the bulldozer blade for Sherman [[Combat engineering vehicle|dozer tanks]], [[Duplex Drive]] for "swimming" Sherman tanks, R3 flame thrower for ''Zippo'' [[flame tank]]s, and the [[T34 Calliope|T34 60-tube ''Calliope'' 4.5" rocket launcher]] for the Sherman turret. The British variants (DD's and mine flails) were among "[[Hobart's Funnies]]," named after their commander, [[Percy Hobart]] of the [[79th Armoured Division]]. [[Image:Ronson flame tank Iwo Jima.jpg|thumb|right|A M4A3R3 used by the [[United States Marine Corps|USMC]] during the [[Battle of Iwo Jima]].]]

The M4 Sherman's basic chassis was used for all the sundry roles of a modern mechanized force: roughly 50,000 Sherman tanks, plus thousands more derivative vehicles under different model numbers. These included M32 and M74 "tow truck"-style [[armoured recovery vehicle|recovery tanks]] with winches, booms, and an 81&amp;nbsp;mm mortar for smoke screens; M34 (from M32B1) and M35 (from M10A1) [[artillery tractor|artillery prime movers]]; [[M7 Priest|M7B1]], [[M12 Gun Motor Carriage|M12]], [[M40 GMC|M40, and M43]] self-propelled artillery; and the [[M10 Wolverine|M10]] and [[M36 Jackson|M36]] tank destroyers.

The M4 Sherman served with the [[United States Army|U.S. Army]] and [[United States Marine Corps|Marine Corps]] during World War II. The U.S. also supplied large numbers to the various [[Allies of World War II|Allied]] countries. Shermans were used during the war by British and Commonwealth armies, the [[Soviet Union]]'s [[Red Army]], [[Free France|Free French]] forces, the [[Poland|Polish]] [[Polish Armed Forces in the West#Army|army in exile]], [[China]]'s [[National Revolutionary Army]], and [[Brazil]]'s  [[Brazilian Expeditionary Force (FEB)|Expeditionary Force]].

The U.S. Marine Corps used the diesel M4A2 and gasoline-powered M4A3 in the Pacific. However, the Chief of the Army's Armored Force, Lt. Gen. [[Jacob L. Devers]], ordered that no diesel-engined Sherman tanks be used by the Army outside the Zone of Interior (the continental U.S.). The U.S. Army used all types for either training or testing within the United States, but intended the M4A2 and M4A4 to be the primary [[Lend-Lease]] exports.

The M4A1 Sherman first saw combat at the [[Second Battle of El Alamein]] in October 1942 with the [[Eighth Army (United Kingdom)|British 8th Army]]. The first U.S. Shermans in battle were M4A1s in [[Operation Torch|Operation ''Torch'']] the next month. At this time, Shermans successfully engaged German Panzer IIIs with long barreled 50mm L60 guns, and Panzer IVs with short barreled 75&amp;nbsp;mm L24 guns. Additional M4 and M4A1s replaced M3 Lees in U.S. tank battalions over the course of the North African campaigns. However, by June 1944, most German tanks were up-gunned and 75&amp;nbsp;mm Shermans were outgunned. The M4 and M4A1 were the main types in U.S. units until late 1944, when the Army began replacing them with the preferred M4A3 with its more powerful {{Convert|500|hp|kW|-1|abbr=on}} engine. Some M4s and M4A1s continued in U.S. service for the rest of the war.

The first Sherman to enter combat with the 76&amp;nbsp;mm gun (July 1944) was the M4A1, closely followed by the M4A3. By the end of the war, half the U.S. Army Shermans in Europe had the 76&amp;nbsp;mm gun. The first HVSS Sherman to see combat was the M4A3E8(76)W in December 1944. The M4A3E8 (76)W was arguably the best of the US Sherman tanks.

'''Thickness''' in [[geology]] and [[mining]] refers to the distance across a packet of [[rock (geology)|rock]], whether it be a [[facies]], [[stratum]], [[bed (geology)|bed]], [[seam (geology)|seam]], [[lode]] etc. 

Thickness is measured at right angles to the surface of the seam or bed and thus independently of its spatial orientation. The concept of thickness came originally from mining language, where it was used mainly to indicate the [[workability]] of seams. It has since become an established term in [[earth science]], for example in geology, for the depth of [[sedimentary rock]]s, in [[hydrogeology]] for the vertical extent of [[groundwater]] – i.e. the distance from the base of the groundwater layer to its surface – or in [[soil science]] for the vertical extent of [[soil horizon]]s.

'''Tissø''' is the 4th largest [[freshwater]] lake in [[Denmark]], at 12.3&amp;nbsp;km&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;. It is located on the western part of [[Zealand]], in the municipality of [[Kalundborg municipality|Kalundborg]].

There are several small towns and villages near the lake, of which Sæby is the biggest at 343 citizens (2013).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dst.dk/en.aspx Statistics Denmark] Satistikbanken Tabel BEF44.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the town of [[Kalundborg]], some of Lake Tissø's outflow is used as cooling water for the [[Kalundborg Eco-industrial Park]].

==Etymology==
Tissø means 'The God's Lake', but the etymology and meaning is not obvious. Basically the name can be broken into ''Tis-sø'', where ''sø'' means 'lake' in a literal and simple translation from Danish to English. ''Tis'' is the more interesting part and refers to the old god [[Týr|Tir]], who have given name to many places in Denmark such as Tisvilde, Tirslund or Thisted, for example, and Tissø was originally known as 'Tir's Lake'. However, the word ''Ti'' is also an [[Old Danish]] word meaning 'God', without being specific. For unknown reasons, it appears that at some point during the [[Nordic Iron Age|Iron Age]], the new god [[Thor|Tor]] took over Tir's role as a god of war.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Nordiske Guder og Helte|trans-title=Nordic Gods and Heroes|language=Danish|author=Anders Bæksted|publisher=Politikens Forlag|page=103|date=1994}}&lt;/ref&gt; In relation to Lake Tissø, this religious change would imply that the name means 'The God's Lake', relying on the meaning of the word ''ti'', without being specific about which god, or gods for that matter.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.kalmus.dk/Sidehistorier%20og%20program08/Tyr%20fra%20Tiss%C3%B8.pdf Tyr fra Tissø – et offerfund fra jernalderen] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131215015312/http://www.kalmus.dk/Sidehistorier%20og%20program08/Tyr%20fra%20Tiss%C3%B8.pdf |date=2013-12-15 }} Kalundborg Museum {{da icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=DSR&gt;[http://navn.ku.dk/maanedens_navn/tissoe/ Tissø] Department of Scandinavian Research, University of Copenhagen {{da icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In recent years, a slightly different understanding of the origins of the name Tissø have emerged. It is possible that the name originally was ''Tis-ø'' and that the extra ''s'' was added later on, when name-recording was needed. The pronunciation of ''Tissø'' and ''Tis-ø'' is almost the same, but the later translates as 'Tir's Island', possibly referring to the area around Fugledegård on the western shore of the lake. Fugledegård was once a settlement and a magnates residence in the [[Viking Age]] and situated on a relatively high lying area, that used to be an [[islet]]. Remains of a [[cult]]-house have been excavated and there are numerous remains of animal sacrifices and religious practises at Fugledegård. There is no doubt that the area was an important religious site in former ages and it is possible that it gave name to the entire lake.&lt;ref name=DSR/&gt;&lt;ref name=Sacrifice&gt;{{cite web|url=http://en.natmus.dk/historical-knowledge/denmark/prehistoric-period-until-1050-ad/the-viking-age/the-magnate-dynasty-at-tissoe/sacrifices-to-the-norse-god-tyr|title=Sacrifices to the Norse God Tyr?|publisher=National Museum of Denmark|accessdate=10 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are many myths and legends about the origin of lake Tissø.&lt;ref name=DSR/&gt;

==History==
The lake of Tissø was created after the ice receded, at the end of the [[Last glacial period#Weichselian glaciaton|last ice age]]. Parts of the ice cover were left behind and landlocked in valleys of the virgin lands. Such ice pockets are known as [[dead-ice]] and as the climate steadily warmed up, they melted and turned into freshwater lakes also known as [[Kettle (landform)|kettle holes]].

Tissø have always had a great importance for the people living here. In the earliest of times, humans hunted around the lake in the summer months and there are numerous traces of their activities in the area and the wetlands now surrounding the lake. [[Maglemosen]] southwest of the lake and [[Åmosen]] to the east, are of special mention here, since they have revealed defining archaeological finds of the socalled [[Maglemosian culture]] and [[Kongemose culture]], in the years 1900 and 1952 respectively.

Later on, when the climate warmed up and people begun to build permanent settlements, the lake also became important as a place of [[sacrifice|sacrifition]] and [[votive offering]]s. There have been many finds from the [[Nordic Iron Age|Iron Age]] and [[Viking Age]] and the cult practices continued on after the [[Christianization of Scandinavia|Christianization of Denmark]] even.&lt;ref name=Sacrifice/&gt;

===Kalmargården===
There are several excavations of Iron Age settlements around Tissø and in 1976 a large golden ornamental ring manufactured in the 10th century, was unearthed during a regular field-plowing. The Tissø Ring is a neck-ring with a diameter of 30&amp;nbsp;cm and at 1.83&amp;nbsp;kg (originally 2&amp;nbsp;kg), it is one of the largest gold finds in Denmark.&lt;ref name=Who&gt;{{cite web|url=http://en.natmus.dk/historical-knowledge/denmark/prehistoric-period-until-1050-ad/the-viking-age/the-magnate-dynasty-at-tissoe/who-was-the-magnate-at-the-tissoe-residence/|title=Who was the magnate at the Tissø residence?|publisher=National Museum of Denmark|accessdate=10 October 2015}} Picture of the Tissø Ring.&lt;/ref&gt; This led to professional investigations and remains of a Viking estate was discovered at the site now known as 'Kalmargården', near Fugledegård on the western lakebrink.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://en.natmus.dk/historical-knowledge/denmark/prehistoric-period-until-1050-ad/the-viking-age/the-magnate-dynasty-at-tissoe/|title=The magnate dynasty at Tissø|publisher=National Museum of Denmark|accessdate=10 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1995-2003 large scale excavations revealed, that the total settlement covered c. 500,000 m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; (50 ha), centered around a 12 x 48 m hall and with several buildings and structures believed to have ritualistic purposes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://en.natmus.dk/historical-knowledge/denmark/prehistoric-period-until-1050-ad/the-viking-age/the-magnate-dynasty-at-tissoe/the-magnates-courtyard-at-tissoe/|title=The magnate’s courtyard at Tissø|publisher=National Museum of Denmark|accessdate=10 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2012 remains of another large hall measuring 8 x 35 m was discovered.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://natmus.dk/presse-og-nyheder/nyhedsarkiv/2012/ny-hal-fundet-ved-tissoe/|title=

It has been suggested that Kalmargården served as a seasonal residence for the royal family based in Old Lejre.&lt;ref name=Who/&gt;

Some of the historic evidence is on exhibit at Kalundborg Museum in [[Kalundborg]] and others are on exhibit at the [[National Museum of Denmark]] in [[Copenhagen]]. There is a visitor center near the Viking magnate's former residence; Fugledegård visitor centre.

Even though Tissø is steadily polluted by excessive nutrients from the surrounding farmlands and inflows, the environmental standard of the lake is usually considered good, because of the high rate of water exchange and an effective [[Water aeration#Natural aeration|natural oxygenation]] of surface waters. Therefore, the lake supports a rich fish and plant life, with around 20 species of fish living here. Most of the fish are spending their entire life in the lake, but a few, like the [[ide (fish)|ide]] and the [[brown trout]], migrates from the sea through the stream of Nedre Halleby Å. Surprisingly, the lake also houses [[European flounder]]. The flounder can live in the fresh waters of the lake, but they cannot spawn here.&lt;ref name=Folder1&gt;[http://www.naturstyrelsen.dk/NR/rdonlyres/FBC988EC-07E6-4A4D-934D-336253A8E7B5/12054/Tissoe_folder.pdf Fugledegård at Tissø] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140219071333/http://www.naturstyrelsen.dk/NR/rdonlyres/FBC988EC-07E6-4A4D-934D-336253A8E7B5/12054/Tissoe_folder.pdf |date=2014-02-19 }} Danish Nature Agency 2004 {{da icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; Tissø formerly supported professional fishing, but is now exclusively fished by [[angling|anglers]] only.&lt;ref&gt;[http://issuu.com/naturparkaamosen/docs/naturparkplan_for_naturpark___mosen/52 Naturparkplan] Naturpark Åmosen, 2013, p.50 {{da icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; Fishing is strongly regulated nowadays, requiring a fishing licence&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.fisketegn.dk/fisketegn/common/setLocale.do?language=en Welcome to the Fishing Licence System] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140203042256/https://www.fisketegn.dk/fisketegn/common/setLocale.do?language=en |date=2014-02-03 }} The Danish AgriFish Agency&lt;/ref&gt; and restricted to the daylight hours more than 100 m from the shores. Two larger areas of the western part of the lake, is also to be protected from both fishing and sailing, and rules apply to what size and kind of fish can be caught. According to the angling association 'Lystfiskeriforeningen Anno 1886', the lake is dominated by [[European perch]], but a good sized population of [[northern pike]] is here as well. Other common fish includes [[tench]], various [[carp]]s and [[European eel]]. There is a small and fragile population of [[zander]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://lystfiskeriforeningen.dk/fiskevande/tissoe Tissø] Lystfiskeriforeningen Anno 1886 (The Angling Association) {{da icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Birds===
Tissø is home to a rich and varied birdlife and occasionally hunting [[white-tailed eagle]]s or [[osprey]]s can be seen – a rare sight in Denmark.&lt;ref name=birdhide&gt;[http://www.naturstyrelsen.dk/Nyheder/2013/fugleskjul_tissoe.htm Be close to white-tailed eagles] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140219062751/http://www.naturstyrelsen.dk/Nyheder/2013/fugleskjul_tissoe.htm |date=2014-02-19 }} Danish Nature Agency {{da icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; On the lake itself [[great crested grebe]], [[common merganser]], various [[dabbling duck|dabbling]] and [[diving duck]]s, [[greylag goose]], [[bean goose]], [[Canada goose]], [[mute swan]], [[whooper swan]], [[tundra swan]] and [[Eurasian coot]] are usual residents. The [[beach meadow]]s and [[reed bed]]s house many foraging and breeding birds like [[pied avocet]], [[little tern]], [[common reed bunting]], [[Eurasian reed warbler]] and [[western marsh harrier]] in addition to [[Eurasian bittern]], [[bearded reedling]], [[Eurasian penduline tit]] and [[common grasshopper warbler]]. Almost all of the lakeside is on private hands, but there is a publicly accessible birdwatching tower near Fugledegård.&lt;ref name=birdhide/&gt; Both the lake and the associated reed beds are of international importance to migratory birds, so hunting and ordinary traffic is strongly regulated in the eastern section.&lt;ref name="Tissø DNA"&gt;[http://www.naturstyrelsen.dk/Udgivelser/Foldere/Reservater/tissoe.htm Tissø] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140219025615/http://www.naturstyrelsen.dk/Udgivelser/Foldere/Reservater/tissoe.htm |date=2014-02-19 }} Danish Nature Agency {{da icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Plants ===
On the southeastern shores near the village of Sæby is a protected strip of land consisting of dry [[commons]] on steep slopes, where human traffic is prohibited from 1 April to 15 July. The protection safeguards a special plant life here, breeding birds and the general view of the lake. North of this strip is a small [[deciduous forest]] known as Klinteskoven, with public access to the lake shores.&lt;ref name="Tissø DNA"/&gt;

The steep slopes at Tissø's northern end is also to be protected. Here sunloving plants like [[Pulsatilla pratensis|small pasque flower]], [[sunrose]] and [[Helichrysum arenarium|dwarf everlast]] are found, with the rare and threatened [[Scabiosa|fragrant scabious]] in between. The [[meadow]]s below the cliffs are also of botanical interest, supporting plants like [[Pedicularis|marsh lousewort]], [[bog-star]] and various [[Carex|true sedges]] like [[Carex flacca|blue sedge]] along with orchids like [[early marsh orchid]], [[western marsh orchid]] and [[Epipactis palustris|marsh helleborine]], in a [[biotope]] of calcium-rich springs.&lt;ref name=Folder1/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://issuu.com/naturparkaamosen/docs/plejeplan_for_tiss__-_2009 Naturpark Åmosen: Administrationplan for the protected areas at Tissø] Orbicon, 2009 (p.9-10) {{da icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===The nature park===
The lake of Tissø is part of [[Naturpark Åmosen]]; a c. 8,000 ha [[nature park]] consisting primarily of [[Natura 2000]] designations.

During the construction work on the railway line [[Athens]]-[[Thessaloniki]], the remains of an ancient farmhouse were discovered at '''Tria Platania''' ([[Greek language|Greek]] Τρία Πλατάνια, Three plane trees). Rescue excavations allowed a small part of the existing antiquities to be located and examined. The largest part of the excavation site is today under the route of the railway line.&lt;ref&gt;ΕΦΟΡΕΙΑ ΠΡΟΪΣΤΟΡΙΚΩΝ ΚΑΙ ΚΛΑΣΙΚΩΝ ΑΡΧΑΙΟΤΗΤΩΝ,ΠΙΕΡΙΑ,Τρία Πλατάνια, page 209 (in Greek language)&lt;/ref&gt; A study (published in 2008) examined the remains of olives to determine how the olive oil was produced in the period from the fourth to the second century BC.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.academia.edu/people/search?utf8=✓&amp;q=tria+platania|title=Olive oil production in Hellenistic Greece: The interpretation of charred olive remains from the site of Tria Platania,Macedonia, Greece, pp 394-401 &lt;nowiki&gt;(&lt;/nowiki&gt;fourth–second century BC.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Efi Poulaki-Pantermali: ''Oikos – Oikia – Oikonomia, Polis – Politiki – Politismos'', Greek Ministry for culture and sport, Thessaloniki 2014, page 70&lt;/ref&gt;

== Location ==
The place is located on the ancient road that connects the [[Thessalia]]n province of Perraivia with the [[Macedonia (Greece)|Macedonia]]n province of [[Pieria (regional unit)|Pieria]], in the vicinity of the railway tunnel and the motorway exit [[Platamonas]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.academia.edu/people/search?utf8=✓&amp;q=tria+platania|title=Olive oil production in Hellenistic Greece: The interpretation of charred olive remains from the site of Tria Platania,Macedonia, Greece, page 1 &lt;nowiki&gt;(&lt;/nowiki&gt;fourth–second century BC.}}&lt;/ref&gt;


== The ancient site ==
[[File:Tria Platania - Tongefäße.jpg|thumb|Tria Platania - clay store vessels (Neoi Poroi, railway station)]]
The excavations were carried out in two phases. The first works began in May 1999 and lasted until March 2000. The second phase of excavation began in February 2007 and was completed in November of the same year.&lt;ref&gt;ΕΦΟΡΕΙΑ ΠΡΟΪΣΤΟΡΙΚΩΝ ΚΑΙ ΚΛΑΣΙΚΩΝ ΑΡΧΑΙΟΤΗΤΩΝ,ΠΙΕΡΙΑ,Τρία Πλατάνια, page 209 (in Greek language)&lt;/ref&gt; Most of the remains of the Tria Platania settlement were destroyed during the construction of the railway tunnel. A farmhouse from the Hellenistic period was discovered; Coins and pottery helped dating the find to the end of the 4th century BC. It is one of the largest ancient farmhouses ever found in Greece. The building had a floor area of approximately 55 m by 42.50 m and extended from east to west. This design was preferred for climatic reasons, as this is the main wind direction.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.academia.edu/people/search?utf8=✓&amp;q=tria+platania|title=Olive oil production in Hellenistic Greece: The interpretation of charred olive remains from the site of Tria Platania,Macedonia, Greece, page 2 &lt;nowiki&gt;(&lt;/nowiki&gt;fourth–second century BC.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Grapes were cultivated and wine produced. In the northwestern part of the house was an extensive deposit with large clay vessels, the other rooms of the building were smaller.

In the middle of the courtyard, the foundations of a tower were uncovered. Nearby was a well that had been drilled at least ten meters deep. In the northeast of the complex began a wall with a length of 32 meters and a width of 1.20 meters.

The building initially stood only until the beginning of the third century BC. It was destroyed by fire along with its vineyard, as well as the neighboring farmhouse Kompoloi. The cause is assumed to be an attack of the Aitolians. As coin finds from the time of Antigonos Gonatas show, the complex was rebuilt immediately, the north side was replaced and reinforced. The wine production now gave way to the production of olive oil. Coin finds from the time of Philip II indicate that the estate was abandoned at the beginning of the 2nd century BC.&lt;ref&gt;ΕΦΟΡΕΙΑ ΠΡΟΪΣΤΟΡΙΚΩΝ ΚΑΙ ΚΛΑΣΙΚΩΝ ΑΡΧΑΙΟΤΗΤΩΝ,ΠΙΕΡΙΑ,Τρία Πλατάνια (in Greek language)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.academia.edu/people/search?utf8=✓&amp;q=tria+platania|title=Olive oil production in Hellenistic Greece: The interpretation of charred olive remains from the site of Tria Platania,Macedonia, Greece &lt;nowiki&gt;(&lt;/nowiki&gt;fourth–second century BC.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Memorial ==
At the train station of the village Neoi Poroi (Νέοι Πόροι) a small memorial was built. Protected by a roof construction, the remains of the storage vessels can be seen there as they were found in the farmhouse.

== The finds ==
In addition to coins and pottery,  a variety of smaller items were excavated.

The oldest of the coins date from the time of the founding of the winery, at the end of the 4th century BC. Obviously, they were hidden during the construction phase because they were under the floor of the building. The most recent coins were found in the rubble of the roof tiles.

As pottery, household vessels of all kinds, remains of amphorae, oil lamps and clay weights for the weaving were found. The clay vessels were often decorated. The clay head of a female figure is the only find of a terracotta statue.

Furthermore, the archaeologists discovered perfume bottles, lead weights, needles, spatulas, bronze and iron nails, an iron key, iron fittings and iron rings. On weapons, daggers and knives were excavated.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.academia.edu/people/search?utf8=✓&amp;q=tria+platania|title=Olive oil production in Hellenistic Greece: The interpretation of charred olive remains from the site of Tria Platania,Macedonia, Greece, page 2 &lt;nowiki&gt;(&lt;/nowiki&gt;fourth–second century BC.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Efi Poulaki-Pantermali: ''Oikos – Oikia – Oikonomia, Polis – Politiki – Politismos'', Greek Ministry for culture and sport, Thessaloniki 2014, page 70&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Wind''' is the flow of [[gas]]es on a large scale. On the surface of the Earth, wind consists of the bulk movement of air. In [[outer space]], [[solar wind]] is the movement of gases or charged particles from the Sun through space, while [[planetary wind]] is the [[outgassing]] of light [[chemical element]]s from a planet's atmosphere into space. Winds are commonly classified by their [[scale (spatial)|spatial scale]], their [[speed]], the types of forces that cause them, the regions in which they occur, and their effect. The strongest observed winds on a planet in the [[Solar System]] occur on [[Neptune]] and [[Saturn]]. Winds have various aspects, an important one being its [[velocity]] ([[wind speed]]); another the density of the gas involved; another its energy content or [[wind energy]]. Wind is also a great source of transportation for seeds and small birds; with time things can travel thousands of miles in the wind.

In [[meteorology]], winds are often referred to according to their strength, and the direction from which the wind is blowing. Short bursts of high-speed wind are termed gusts. Strong winds of intermediate duration (around one minute) are termed [[squall]]s. Long-duration winds have various names associated with their average strength, such as [[wikt:breeze|breeze]], [[gale]], [[Storm#Classification|storm]], and [[hurricane]]. Wind occurs on a range of scales, from thunderstorm flows lasting tens of minutes, to local breezes generated by heating of land surfaces and lasting a few hours, to global winds resulting from the difference in absorption of [[solar energy]] between the [[climate zone]]s on Earth. The two main causes of large-scale [[atmospheric circulation]] are the differential heating between the equator and the poles, and the rotation of the planet ([[Coriolis effect]]). Within the tropics, [[thermal low]] circulations over terrain and high plateaus can drive [[monsoon]] circulations. In coastal areas the [[sea breeze]]/land breeze cycle can define local winds; in areas that have variable terrain, mountain and valley breezes can dominate local winds.

In human civilization, the concept of wind has been explored in [[mythology]], influenced the events of history, expanded the range of transport and warfare, and provided a [[wind power|power source]] for mechanical work, electricity and recreation. Wind powers the voyages of [[sailing ship]]s across Earth's oceans. [[Hot air balloon]]s use the wind to take short trips, and powered flight uses it to increase lift and reduce fuel consumption. Areas of [[wind shear]] caused by various weather phenomena can lead to dangerous situations for aircraft. When winds become strong, trees and human-made structures are damaged or destroyed.

Winds can shape landforms, via a variety of [[aeolian processes]] such as the formation of fertile soils, such as [[loess]], and by [[erosion]]. Dust from large deserts can be moved great distances from its source region by the [[prevailing winds]]; winds that are accelerated by rough topography and associated with dust outbreaks have been assigned regional names in various parts of the world because of their significant effects on those regions. Wind also affects the spread of [[wildfire]]s. Winds can disperse seeds from various plants, enabling the survival and dispersal of those plant species, as well as flying insect populations. When combined with cold temperatures, wind has a negative impact on livestock. Wind affects animals' food stores, as well as their hunting and defensive strategies.

Wind is caused by differences in the [[atmospheric pressure]]. When a [[pressure gradient force|difference in atmospheric pressure]] exists, air moves from the higher to the lower pressure area, resulting in winds of various speeds. On a rotating planet, air will also be deflected by the [[Coriolis effect]], except exactly on the equator. Globally, the two major driving factors of large-scale wind patterns (the [[atmospheric circulation]]) are the differential heating between the equator and the poles (difference in absorption of [[solar energy]] leading to [[buoyancy force]]s) and the [[Coriolis effect|rotation of the planet]]. Outside the tropics and aloft from frictional effects of the surface, the large-scale winds tend to approach [[geostrophic balance]]. Near the Earth's surface, [[friction]] causes the wind to be slower than it would be otherwise. Surface friction also causes winds to blow more inward into low-pressure areas.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author = JetStream|title = Origin of Wind|publisher = [[National Weather Service]] Southern Region Headquarters|year= 2008|accessdate=2009-02-16 |url = http://www.srh.noaa.gov/jetstream//synoptic/wind.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Makarieva|first=Anastassia|author2=V.

Winds defined by an equilibrium of physical forces are used in the decomposition and analysis of wind profiles. They are useful for simplifying the atmospheric [[equations of motion]] and for making qualitative arguments about the horizontal and vertical distribution of winds. The [[geostrophic wind]] component is the result of the balance between Coriolis force and pressure gradient force. It flows parallel to [[isobar (meteorology)|isobars]] and approximates the flow above the [[atmospheric boundary layer]] in the midlatitudes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Glossary of Meteorology|title=Geostrophic wind|publisher=[[American Meteorological Society]]|year=2009|accessdate=2009-03-18|url=http://amsglossary.allenpress.com/glossary/search?id=geostrophic-wind1|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071016223621/http://amsglossary.allenpress.com/glossary/search?id=geostrophic-wind1|archivedate=2007-10-16|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[thermal wind]] is the ''difference'' in the geostrophic wind between two levels in the atmosphere.

== Wind force scale ==
{{See also|Tropical cyclone scales|Surface weather analysis}}
Historically, the [[Beaufort scale|Beaufort wind force scale]] (created by [[Francis Beaufort|Beaufort]]) provides an empirical description of wind speed based on observed sea conditions. Originally it was a 13-level scale, but during the 1940s, the scale was expanded to 17&amp;nbsp;levels.&lt;ref name="Beaufort"&gt;{{cite book|author=Walter J. Saucier|year=2003|url=https://books.google.com/?id=CM99-uKpR00C&amp;pg=PA407|title=Principles of Meteorological Analysis|publisher=[[Courier Dover Publications]]|isbn=978-0-486-49541-5|accessdate=2009-01-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are general terms that differentiate winds of different average speeds such as a breeze, a gale, a storm, tornado, or a hurricane. Within the Beaufort scale, gale-force winds lie between {{convert|sp=us|28|kn|km/h}} and {{convert|sp=us|55|kn|km/h}} with preceding adjectives such as moderate, fresh, strong, and whole used to differentiate the wind's strength within the gale category.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Glossary of Meteorology|year=2009|url=http://amsglossary.allenpress.com/glossary/browse?s=G&amp;p=1|title=G|publisher=American Meteorological Society|accessdate=2009-03-18|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/68bsMJ6Wm?url=http://amsglossary.allenpress.com/glossary/browse?s=G&amp;p=1|archivedate=2012-06-22|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; A storm has winds of {{convert|sp=us|56|kn|km/h}} to {{convert|sp=us|63|kn|km/h}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Glossary of Meteorology|year=2009|url=http://amsglossary.allenpress.com/glossary/search?id=storm1|title=Storm|publisher=American Meteorological Society|accessdate=2009-03-18|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071015220345/http://amsglossary.allenpress.com/glossary/search?id=storm1|archivedate=2007-10-15|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The terminology for tropical cyclones differs from one region to another globally.

=== Station model ===
[[File:Wind barbs.gif|thumb|right|Wind plotting within a station model]]

The [[station model]] plotted on surface [[weather map]]s uses a wind barb to show both wind direction and speed. The wind barb shows the speed using "flags" on the end.
* Each half of a flag depicts {{convert|sp=us|5|kn|km/h}} of wind.
* Each full flag depicts {{convert|sp=us|10|kn|km/h}} of wind.
* Each [[pennant (commissioning)|pennant]] (filled triangle) depicts {{convert|sp=us|50|kn|km/h}} of wind.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|work=[[Hydrometeorological Prediction Center]]|year=2009|url=http://www.wpc.ncep.noaa.gov/html/stationplot.shtml|title=Decoding the station model|publisher=[[National Centers for Environmental Prediction]]|accessdate=2007-05-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Winds are depicted as blowing from the direction the barb is facing. Therefore, a northeast wind will be depicted with a line extending from the cloud circle to the northeast, with flags indicating wind speed on the northeast end of this line.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.srh.weather.gov/srh/jetstream/synoptic/wxmaps.htm|title=How to read weather maps|year=2008|work=JetStream|publisher=National Weather Service|accessdate=2009-06-27|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/68bsDeVx8?url=http://www.srh.weather.gov/srh/jetstream/synoptic/wxmaps.htm|archivedate=2012-06-22|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Once plotted on a map, an analysis of [[isotach]]s (lines of equal wind speeds) can be accomplished. Isotachs are particularly useful in diagnosing the location of the [[jet stream]] on upper level constant pressure charts, and are usually located at or above the 300&amp;nbsp;hPa level.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Terry T. Lankford|year=2000|url=https://books.google.com/?id=kSSn7vPgmUQC&amp;pg=PT187|title=Aviation Weather Handbook|publisher=[[McGraw-Hill Professional]]|isbn=978-0-07-136103-3|accessdate=2008-01-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Wind power ==
{{Main|Wind power}}
Wind energy is the [[kinetic energy]] of the air in motion. The kinetic energy of a packet of air of mass ''m'' with velocity ''v'' is given by ''½ m v&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;''. To find the mass of the packet passing through an area ''A'' perpendicular its velocity (which could be the rotor area of a turbine), we multiply its volume after time ''t'' has passed with the [[air density]] ''ρ'', which gives us ''m'' = ''A'' ''v'' ''t'' ''ρ''. So, we find that the total wind energy is:

:&lt;math&gt;E = \frac{1}{2} \rho A v^3 t&lt;/math&gt;

[[Derivative|Differentiating]] with respect to time to find the rate of increase of energy, we find that the total wind [[Power (physics)|power]] is:

:&lt;math&gt;P = dE/dt = \frac{1}{2} \rho A v^3&lt;/math&gt;

Wind power is thus proportional to the third power of the wind velocity.

=== Theoretical power captured by a wind turbine ===

Total wind power could be captured only if the wind velocity is reduced to zero. In a realistic wind turbine this is impossible, as the captured air must also leave the turbine. A relation between the input and output wind velocity must be considered. Using the concept of [[stream tube]], the maximal achievable extraction of wind power by a wind turbine is {{sfrac|16|27}} ≈ 59% of the total theoretical wind power&lt;ref&gt;[http://apps.carleton.edu/campus/library/digitalcommons/assets/pacp_7.pdf The Physics of Wind Turbines]. Kira Grogg Carleton College (2005) p. 8. (PDF). Retrieved 2011-11-03.&lt;/ref&gt; (see: [[Betz' law]]).

=== Practical wind turbine power ===
Further insufficiencies, such as rotor blade [[friction]] and [[drag (physics)|drag]], gearbox losses, generator and converter losses, reduce the power delivered by a wind turbine. The basic relation that the turbine power is (approximately) proportional to the third power of velocity remains.

== Global climatology ==
{{Main|Prevailing winds}}
[[File:Map prevailing winds on earth.png|right|thumb|The westerlies and trade winds]]
[[File:Earth Global Circulation.jpg|right|thumb|Winds are part of Earth's atmospheric circulation]]
Easterly winds, on average, dominate the flow pattern across the poles, westerly winds blow across the [[mid-latitudes]] of the earth, polewards of the [[subtropical ridge]], while easterlies again dominate the [[tropics]].

Directly under the subtropical ridge are the doldrums, or horse latitudes, where winds are lighter. Many of the Earth's deserts lie near the average latitude of the subtropical ridge, where descent reduces the [[relative humidity]] of the air mass.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=g3CbqZtaF4oC&amp;pg=PA121|title=Encyclopedia of Deserts|author=Michael A.

=== Westerlies and their impact ===
[[File:Franklingulfstream.jpg|thumb|right|[[Benjamin Franklin]]'s map of the [[Gulf Stream]]]]
{{Main|Westerlies}}
The Westerlies or the Prevailing Westerlies are the [[prevailing winds]] in the [[middle latitudes]] between 35 and 65&amp;nbsp;degrees [[latitude]]. These prevailing winds blow from the west to the east,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Glossary of Meteorology|year=2009|url=http://amsglossary.allenpress.com/glossary/search?id=westerlies1|title=Westerlies|publisher=American Meteorological Society|accessdate=2009-04-15|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100622073904/http://amsglossary.allenpress.com/glossary/search?id=westerlies1|archivedate=2010-06-22|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.icbemp.gov/science/ferguson_42.pdf |title=Climatology of the Interior Columbia River Basin |author=Sue Ferguson |date=2001-09-07 |publisher=Interior Columbia Basin Ecosystem Management Project |accessdate=2009-09-12 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090515003307/http://www.icbemp.gov/science/ferguson_42.pdf |archivedate=2009-05-15 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; and steer extratropical cyclones in this general manner. The winds are predominantly from the southwest in the Northern Hemisphere and from the northwest in the Southern Hemisphere.&lt;ref name="Ralph" /&gt; They are strongest in the winter when the pressure is lower over the poles, and weakest during the summer and when pressures are higher over the poles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Halldór Björnsson |year=2005 |url=http://andvari.vedur.is/~halldor/HB/Met210old/GlobCirc.html |title=Global circulation |publisher=Veðurstofu Íslands |accessdate=2008-06-15 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110807132251/http://andvari.vedur.is/~halldor/HB/Met210old/GlobCirc.html |archivedate=2011-08-07 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Together with the [[trade wind]]s, the westerlies enabled a round-trip trade route for sailing ships crossing the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans, as the westerlies lead to the development of strong ocean currents on the western sides of oceans in both hemispheres through the process of [[western intensification]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=[[National Environmental Satellite, Data, and Information Service]]|year=2009|url=http://www.science-house.org/nesdis/gulf/background.html|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100503013457/http://www.science-house.org/nesdis/gulf/background.html|archivedate=2010-05-03|title=Investigating the Gulf Stream|publisher=[[North Carolina State University]]|accessdate=2009-05-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; These western ocean currents transport warm, sub tropical water polewards toward the [[polar region]]s. The westerlies can be particularly strong, especially in the southern hemisphere, where there is less land in the middle latitudes to cause the flow pattern to amplify, which slows the winds down. The strongest westerly winds in the middle latitudes are within a band known as the [[Roaring Forties]], between [[40th parallel south|40]] and [[50th parallel south|50&amp;nbsp;degrees latitude south]] of the equator.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Stuart Walker|title=The sailor's wind|publisher=[[W.

=== Polar easterlies ===
{{Main|Polar easterlies}}
The polar easterlies, also known as Polar Hadley cells, are dry, cold prevailing winds that blow from the high-pressure areas of the [[polar high]]s at the [[north pole|north]] and [[south pole]]s towards the low-pressure areas within the Westerlies at high latitudes. Unlike the Westerlies, these prevailing winds blow from the east to the west, and are often weak and irregular.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Glossary of Meteorology|year=2009|url=http://amsglossary.allenpress.com/glossary/search?p=1&amp;query=polar+easterlies&amp;submit=Search|title=Polar easterlies|publisher=American Meteorological Society|accessdate=2009-04-15|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/68bs8N1wF?url=http://amsglossary.allenpress.com/glossary/search?p=1&amp;query=polar+easterlies&amp;submit=Search|archivedate=2012-06-22|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Because of the low sun angle, cold air builds up and [[Subsidence (atmosphere)|subsides]] at the pole creating surface high-pressure areas, forcing an equatorward outflow of air;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Michael E.

== Local considerations ==
[[File:Map local winds.png|thumb|right|Local winds around the world. These winds are formed through the heating of land (from mountains or flat terrain)]]

=== Sea and land breezes ===
{{Main|Sea breeze}}
[[File:Diagrama de formacion de la brisa-breeze.svg|thumb|A: Sea breeze (occurs at daytime), B: Land breeze (occurs at night)]]
In coastal regions, sea breezes and land breezes can be important factors in a location's prevailing winds. The sea is warmed by the sun more slowly because of water's greater [[specific heat]] compared to land.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author= Steve Ackerman|year=1995|url=http://cimss.ssec.wisc.edu/wxwise/seabrz.html|title=Sea and Land Breezes|publisher=University of Wisconsin|accessdate=2006-10-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; As the temperature of the surface of the land rises, the land heats the air above it by conduction. The warm air is less dense than the surrounding environment and so it rises. This causes a pressure gradient of about 2&amp;nbsp;millibars from the ocean to the land. The cooler air above the sea, now with higher [[sea level pressure]], flows inland into the lower pressure, creating a cooler breeze near the coast. When large-scale winds are calm, the strength of the sea breeze is directly proportional to the temperature difference between the land mass and the sea. If an offshore wind of {{convert|sp=us|8|kn|km/h}} exists, the sea breeze is not likely to develop.

At night, the land cools off more quickly than the ocean because of differences in their [[specific heat]] values. This temperature change causes the daytime sea breeze to dissipate. When the temperature onshore cools below the temperature offshore, the pressure over the water will be lower than that of the land, establishing a land breeze, as long as an onshore wind is not strong enough to oppose it.&lt;ref name="Jet"&gt;{{cite web|author=JetStream: An Online School For Weather |year=2008 |url=http://www.srh.weather.gov/srh/jetstream/ocean/seabreezes.htm |title=The Sea Breeze |publisher=National Weather Service |accessdate=2006-10-24 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060923233344/http://www.srh.weather.gov/srh/jetstream/ocean/seabreezes.htm |archivedate=2006-09-23 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Near mountains ===
[[File:Vol d'onde.svg|right|thumb|Mountain wave schematic. The wind flows towards a mountain and produces a first oscillation (A). A second wave occurs further away and higher. The lenticular clouds form at the peak of the waves (B).]]
Over elevated surfaces, heating of the ground exceeds the heating of the surrounding air at the same altitude above [[sea level]], creating an associated thermal low over the terrain and enhancing any thermal lows that would have otherwise existed,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=National Weather Service Forecast Office in [[Tucson, Arizona]]|year=2008|url=http://www.wrh.noaa.gov/twc/monsoon/monsoon_whatis.php|title=What is a monsoon?|publisher=National Weather Service Western Region Headquarters|accessdate=2009-03-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Douglas G.

In areas where there is rugged [[topography]] that significantly interrupts the environmental wind flow, the wind circulation between mountains and valleys is the most important contributor to the prevailing winds. Hills and valleys substantially distort the airflow by increasing friction between the atmosphere and landmass by acting as a physical block to the flow, deflecting the wind parallel to the range just upstream of the topography, which is known as a [[barrier jet]]. This barrier jet can increase the low level wind by 45%.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=J. D.

If there is a [[mountain pass|pass]] in the mountain range, winds will rush through the pass with considerable speed because of the [[Bernoulli principle]] that describes an inverse relationship between speed and pressure. The airflow can remain turbulent and erratic for some distance downwind into the flatter countryside. These conditions are dangerous to ascending and descending [[airplane]]s.&lt;ref name="Trex"&gt;{{cite web|author=National Center for Atmospheric Research |year=2006 |url=http://www.ucar.edu/communications/quarterly/spring06/trex.jsp |title=T-REX: Catching the Sierra's waves and rotors |publisher=University Corporation for Atmospheric Research |accessdate=2006-10-21 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061121051137/http://www.ucar.edu/communications/quarterly/spring06/trex.jsp |archivedate=2006-11-21 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Cool winds accelerating through mountain gaps have been given regional names. In Central America, examples include the [[Papagayo wind]], the [[Panama]] wind, and the [[Tehuano wind]]. In Europe, similar winds are known as the [[Bora (wind)|Bora]], [[Tramontane]], and [[Mistral (wind)|Mistral]]. When these winds blow over open waters, they increase mixing of the upper layers of the ocean that elevates cool, nutrient rich waters to the surface, which leads to increased marine life.&lt;ref name="Papa"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://daac.gsfc.nasa.gov/oceancolor/scifocus/oceanColor/papagayo.shtml|title=The Papaguayo Wind|author=Anthony Drake|date=2008-02-08|publisher=[[NASA]] Goddard Earth Sciences Data and Information Services Center|accessdate=2009-06-16|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090614113851/http://daac.gsfc.nasa.gov/oceancolor/scifocus/oceanColor/papagayo.shtml|archivedate=2009-06-14|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In mountainous areas, local distortion of the airflow becomes severe. Jagged terrain combines to produce unpredictable flow patterns and turbulence, such as [[lee waves|rotors]], which can be topped by [[lenticular cloud]]s. Strong [[updraft]]s, downdrafts and [[eddies]] develop as the air flows over hills and down valleys. Orographic [[precipitation (meteorology)|precipitation]] occurs on the [[windward]] side of mountains and is caused by the rising air motion of a large-scale flow of moist air across the mountain ridge, also known as upslope flow, resulting in [[adiabatic lapse rate|adiabatic]] cooling and condensation. In mountainous parts of the world subjected to relatively consistent winds (for example, the trade winds), a more moist climate usually prevails on the windward side of a mountain than on the [[leeward]] or downwind side. Moisture is removed by orographic lift, leaving drier air on the descending and generally warming, leeward side where a [[rain shadow]] is observed.&lt;ref name="MT"&gt;{{cite web|author=Michael Pidwirny |year=2008 |url=http://www.physicalgeography.net/fundamentals/8e.html |title=CHAPTER 8: Introduction to the Hydrosphere (e).

== Average wind speeds ==
{{Main|Wind atlas}}
As described earlier, prevailing and local winds are not spread evenly across the earth, which means that wind speeds also differ by region. In addition, the wind speed also increases with the altitude.

=== Wind power density ===
Nowadays, a yardstick used to determine the best locations for wind energy development is referred to as wind power density (WPD). It is a calculation relating to the effective force of the wind at a particular location, frequently expressed in terms of the elevation above ground level over a period of time. It takes into account wind velocity and mass. Color coded maps are prepared for a particular area are described as, for example, "mean annual power density at 50&amp;nbsp;meters". The results of the above calculation are included in an index developed by the National Renewable Energy Lab and referred to as "NREL CLASS". The larger the WPD calculation, the higher it is rated by class.&lt;ref&gt;Kansas Wind Energy Project, Affiliated Atlantic &amp; Western Group Inc, 5250 W 94th Terrace, Prairie Village, Kansas 66207&lt;/ref&gt; At the end of 2008, worldwide [[nameplate capacity]] of wind-powered generators was 120.8&amp;nbsp;[[gigawatt]]s.&lt;ref name="wwea"&gt;{{cite web|author=[[World Wind Energy Association]]|title=120 Gigawatt of wind turbines globally contribute to secure electricity generation|work=Press release|date=2009-02-06|url=http://www.wwindea.org/home/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=223&amp;Itemid=40|accessdate=2009-02-06|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090207190247/http://www.wwindea.org/home/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=223&amp;Itemid=40|archive-date=2009-02-07|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although wind produced only about 1.5% of worldwide electricity use in 2009,&lt;ref name="wwea" /&gt; it is growing rapidly, having doubled in the three years between 2005 and 2008.

=== Recreation ===
[[File:Lilienthal in flight.jpg|thumb|right|[[Otto Lilienthal]] in flight]]
Wind figures prominently in several popular sports, including recreational [[hang gliding]], [[hot air ballooning]], [[kite]] flying, [[snowkiting]], [[kite landboarding]], [[kite surfing]], [[paragliding]], [[sailing]], and [[windsurfing]]. In gliding, wind gradients just above the surface affect the takeoff and landing phases of flight of a [[Glider aircraft|glider]]. Wind gradient can have a noticeable effect on [[ground launch]]es, also known as winch launches or wire launches. If the wind gradient is significant or sudden, or both, and the pilot maintains the same pitch attitude, the indicated airspeed will increase, possibly exceeding the maximum ground launch tow speed. The pilot must adjust the airspeed to deal with the effect of the gradient.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Glider Flying Handbook|year=2003|publisher=U.S. Federal Aviation Administration|location=U.S. Government Printing Office, Washington, D.C.|id=FAA-8083-13_GFH|pages=7–16|url=http://www.faa.gov/library/manuals/aircraft/glider_handbook/|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20051218083721/http://www.faa.gov/library/manuals/aircraft/glider_handbook/|dead-url=yes|archive-date=2005-12-18|accessdate=2009-06-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; When landing, wind shear is also a hazard, particularly when the winds are strong. As the glider descends through the wind gradient on final approach to landing, airspeed decreases while sink rate increases, and there is insufficient time to accelerate prior to ground contact. The pilot must anticipate the wind gradient and use a higher approach speed to compensate for it.&lt;ref name=Piggott&gt;{{cite book|author=Derek Piggott|title=Gliding: a Handbook on Soaring Flight|publisher=Knauff &amp; Grove|year=1997|isbn=978-0-9605676-4-5|pages=85–86, 130–132}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Westerly winds in the mid-latitudes of the planet drive the movement of ocean currents from west to east across the world's oceans. Wind has a very important role in aiding plants and other immobile organisms in dispersal of seeds, spores, pollen, etc. Although wind is not the primary form of seed dispersal in plants, it provides dispersal for a large percentage of the biomass of land plants.

=== Erosion ===
[[File:Im Salar de Uyuni.jpg|thumb|right|A rock formation in the [[Altiplano]], [[Bolivia]], sculpted by wind erosion]]
{{See also|Aeolian processes}}
Erosion can be the result of material movement by the wind. There are two main effects. First, wind causes small particles to be lifted and therefore moved to another region. This is called deflation. Second, these suspended particles may impact on solid objects causing erosion by abrasion (ecological succession). Wind erosion generally occurs in areas with little or no vegetation, often in areas where there is insufficient rainfall to support vegetation. An example is the formation of sand [[dunes]], on a beach or in a desert.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=[[United States Geological Survey]]|year=2004|url=http://geomaps.wr.usgs.gov/parks/coast/dunes/index.html|title=Dunes&amp;nbsp;– Getting Started|accessdate=2009-03-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; Loess is a homogeneous, typically nonstratified, porous, [[friable]], slightly coherent, often calcareous, fine-grained, [[silt]]y, pale yellow or buff, windblown (Aeolian) [[sediment]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=F. von Richthofen|year=1882|title=On the mode of origin of the loess|journal=Geological Magazine (Decade II)|doi=10.1017/S001675680017164X |volume= 9|issue=7|pages=293–305|bibcode=1882GeoM....9..293R}}&lt;/ref&gt; It generally occurs as a widespread blanket deposit that covers areas of hundreds of square kilometers and tens of meters thick.

Fellmann|title=Introduction to Geography, Seventh Edition|year=2000|publisher=[[McGraw-Hill]]|isbn=0-697-38506-X|page=99}}&lt;/ref&gt; Loess deposits are geologically unstable by nature, and will erode very readily. Therefore, windbreaks (such as big trees and bushes) are often planted by farmers to reduce the wind erosion of loess.&lt;ref name="Erosion" /&gt;

=== Desert dust migration ===
During mid-summer (July in the northern hemisphere), the westward-moving trade winds south of the northward-moving subtropical ridge expand northwestward from the Caribbean into southeastern North America. When dust from the [[Sahara]] moving around the southern periphery of the ridge within the belt of trade winds moves over land, rainfall is suppressed and the sky changes from a blue to a white appearance, which leads to an increase in red sunsets. Its presence negatively impacts [[air quality]] by adding to the count of airborne particulates.&lt;ref name=autogenerated2&gt;{{cite web|author=Science Daily|date=1999-07-14|url=https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/1999/07/990714073433.htm|title=African Dust Called A Major Factor Affecting Southeast U.S. Air Quality|accessdate=2007-06-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; Over 50% of the African dust that reaches the United States affects Florida.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Science Daily|date=2001-06-15|url=https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2001/06/010615071508.htm|title=Microbes And The Dust They Ride In On Pose Potential Health Risks|accessdate=2007-06-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since 1970, dust outbreaks have worsened because of periods of drought in Africa.

{{See also|Seed dispersal}}
Wind dispersal of seeds, or [[anemochory]], is one of the more primitive means of dispersal. Wind dispersal can take on one of two primary forms: seeds can float on the breeze or alternatively, they can flutter to the ground.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=J. Gurevitch |author2=S. M. Scheiner |author3=G. A. Fox  |last-author-amp=yes |year=2006|title=Plant Ecology, 2nd ed|publisher=Sinauer Associates, Inc., Massachusetts}}&lt;/ref&gt; The classic examples of these dispersal mechanisms include [[dandelion]]s (''[[Taraxacum]]'' spp., [[Asteraceae]]), which have a feathery [[pappus (flower structure)|pappus]] attached to their seeds and can be dispersed long distances, and [[maple]]s (''[[Acer (genus)]]'' spp., [[Sapindaceae]]), which have winged seeds and flutter to the ground. An important constraint on wind dispersal is the need for abundant seed production to maximize the likelihood of a seed landing in a site suitable for [[germination]]. There are also strong evolutionary constraints on this dispersal mechanism. For instance, species in the Asteraceae on islands tended to have reduced dispersal capabilities (i.e., larger seed mass and smaller pappus) relative to the same species on the mainland.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|authors=M. L. Cody and J. M. Overton|year=1996|title=Short-term evolution of reduced dispersal in island plant populations|jstor=2261699|doi=10.2307/2261699|journal=Journal of Ecology|volume= 84|pages=53–61}}&lt;/ref&gt; Reliance upon wind dispersal is common among many [[weed]]y or [[ruderal]] species. Unusual mechanisms of wind dispersal include [[tumbleweed]]s. A related process to anemochory is [[anemophily]], which is the process where pollen is distributed by wind. Large families of plants are pollinated in this manner, which is favored when individuals of the dominant plant species are spaced closely together.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=isLXD8tZ5GMC&amp;pg=PA88|title=Plant Breeding Systems|author=A.

Wind also limits tree growth. On coasts and isolated mountains, the tree line is often much lower than in corresponding altitudes inland and in larger, more complex mountain systems, because strong winds reduce tree growth. High winds scour away thin [[soil]]s through erosion,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://pubs.aina.ucalgary.ca/arctic/Arctic58-3-286.pdf|title=Wind-Conditioned 20th Century Decline of Birch Treeline Vegetation in the Swedish Scandes|journal=Arctic |volume= 58|issue= 3|year= 2005|pages=286–294|accessdate=2009-06-20|author=Leif Kullman|doi = 10.14430/arctic430}}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as damage limbs and twigs. When high winds knock down or uproot trees, the process is known as [[windthrow]]. This is most likely on [[windward]] slopes of mountains, with severe cases generally occurring to [[tree stand]]s that are 75&amp;nbsp;years or older.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1139/X08-174|title=Stand-replacing windthrow in the boreal forests of eastern Quebec|author1=Mathieu Bouchard |author2=David Pothier |author3=Jean-Claude Ruel  |last-author-amp=yes |journal=Canadian Journal of Forest Research|volume=39|issue= 2|year=2009|pages=481–487}}&lt;/ref&gt; Plant varieties near the coast, such as the [[Sitka spruce]] and [[Coccoloba uvifera|sea grape]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://aggie-horticulture.tamu.edu/syllabi/308/Lists/Fourth%20Edition/Coccolobauvifera.pdf|author=Michael A.

Wind can also cause plants damage through [[sand abrasion]]. Strong winds will pick up loose sand and [[topsoil]] and hurl it through the air at speeds ranging from {{convert|25|mph|kph}} to {{convert|40|mph|kph}}. Such windblown sand causes extensive damage to plant seedlings because it ruptures plant cells, making them vulnerable to evaporation and drought. Using a mechanical sandblaster in a laboratory setting, scientists affiliated with the [[Agricultural Research Service]] studied the effects of windblown sand abrasion on cotton seedlings. The study showed that the seedlings responded to the damage created by the windblown sand abrasion by shifting energy from stem and root growth to the growth and repair of the damaged stems.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ars.usda.gov/is/pr/2010/100126.htm ARS Studies Effect of Wind Sandblasting on Cotton Plants / January 26, 2010 / News from the USDA Agricultural Research Service].

=== Sound generation ===
Wind causes the generation of sound. The movement of air causes movements of parts of natural objects, such as leaves or grass. These objects will produce sound if they touch each other. Even a soft wind will cause a low level of [[environmental noise]]. If the wind is blowing harder, it may produce howling sounds of varying frequencies. This may be caused by the wind blowing over cavities, or by vortices created in the air downstream of an object.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.physicsforums.com/threads/how-does-wind-produce-sounds.118880/|title=How does wind produce sounds?|author=|date=|website=physicsforums.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; Especially on high buildings, many structural parts may be a cause of annoying noise at certain wind conditions. Examples of these parts are balconies, ventilation openings, roof openings or cables.

== In outer space ==
The solar wind is quite different from a terrestrial wind, in that its origin is the sun, and it is composed of charged particles that have escaped the sun's atmosphere. Similar to the solar wind, the [[planetary wind]] is composed of light gases that escape planetary atmospheres. Over long periods of time, the planetary wind can radically change the composition of planetary atmospheres.

The fastest wind ever recorded is coming from the [[accretion disc]] of the [[IGR J17091-3624]] black hole. Its speed is {{convert|20,000,000|mph|kph}}, which is 3% of the [[speed of light]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://chandra.harvard.edu/press/12_releases/press_022112.html|title=Chandra Finds Fastest Winds from Stellar Black Hole|publisher=''NASA''|author=Ashley King|display-authors=etal|accessdate=September 27, 2012|date=February 21, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;
