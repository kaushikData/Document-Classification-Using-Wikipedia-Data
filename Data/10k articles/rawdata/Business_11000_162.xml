'''Alfred Stieglitz''' (January 1, 1864 – July 13, 1946) was an American photographer and modern art promoter who was instrumental over his fifty-year career in making photography an accepted art form. In addition to his photography, Stieglitz was known for the New York art galleries that he ran in the early part of the 20th century, where he introduced many [[avant-garde]] European artists to the U.S. He was married to painter [[Georgia O'Keeffe]].

== Early life and education ==
Stieglitz was born in [[Hoboken, New Jersey]], the first son of [[History of the Jews in Germany|German Jewish]] immigrants Edward Stieglitz (1833–1909) and Hedwig Ann Werner (1845–1922).&lt;ref name="ASAB"&gt;{{cite book|author=Richard Whelan|title=Alfred Stieglitz: A Biography|publisher=NY: Little, Brown|year=1995|pages=11–22, 214, 281, 382, 400}}&lt;/ref&gt; His father was a lieutenant in the [[Union Army]].  He had five siblings, Flora (1865–1890), twins [[Julius Stieglitz|Julius]] (1867–1937) and Leopold (1867–1956), Agnes (1869–1952) and Selma (1871–1957). Alfred Stieglitz, seeing the close relationship of the twins, wished he had a soul mate of his own during his childhood.&lt;ref name="ASAB"/&gt;

Stieglitz attended Charlier Institute, a Christian school and the best private school in New York, in 1871. The following year, his family began spending the summers at [[Lake George (New York)|Lake George]] in the [[Adirondack Mountains]], a tradition that continued into Stieglitz's adulthood.&lt;ref name="ALGO" /&gt;

So that he would qualify for admission to the [[City College of New York]], Stieglitz was enrolled in a public school for his senior year of high school, but found the education inadequate. In 1881, Edward Stieglitz sold his company for US$400,000 and moved his family to Europe for the next several years so that his children would receive a better education. Alfred Stieglitz enrolled in the Real gymnasium in [[Karlsruhe]].&lt;ref name="ALGO"&gt;{{cite book|author=Hunter Drohojowska-Philp|title=Full Bloom: The Art and Life of Georgia O'Keeffe|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=SQzD7mwpPgQC&amp;pg=PA54|year=2004|publisher=W.W. Norton|isbn=978-0-393-05853-6|pages=54–57}}&lt;/ref&gt; The next year, Stieglitz studied mechanical engineering at the [[Technical University of Berlin|Technische Hochschule]] in Berlin. He enrolled in a chemistry class taught by [[Hermann Wilhelm Vogel]], a scientist and researcher, who worked on the chemical processes for developing photographs. In Vogel, Stieglitz found both the academic challenge he needed and an outlet for his growing artistic and cultural interests. He received an allowance of $1,200 ({{inflation|US|1200|1882|fmt=eq}}) a month.&lt;ref name="ALGO" /&gt;&lt;ref name="SBL"&gt;{{cite book|author=Katherine Hoffman|title=Stieglitz: A Beginning Light|publisher=New Haven: Yale University Press Studio|year=2004|pages=55–65, 122–140, 213–222}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Early interest in photography ==
German artists [[Adolf von Menzel]] and [[Wilhelm Hasemann]] were his friends. He bought his first camera and traveled through the European countryside, taking photographs of landscapes and peasants in Germany, Italy and the Netherlands. Photography, he later wrote, "fascinated me, first as a toy, then as a passion, then as an obsession."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=291 — The Little Gallery that Caught the Light|url= https://www.theattic.space/home-page-blogs/2017/11/17/291-the-little-gallery-that-caught-the-light |accessdate=July 27, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Alfred Stieglitz self-portrait, freienwald, 1886.jpg|thumb|left|upright|1886 Self-portrait]]
In 1884, his parents returned to America, but 20-year-old Stieglitz remained in Germany and collected books on photography and photographers in Europe and the U.S.&lt;ref name="Naef"&gt;{{cite book|author= Weston Naef|title=The Collection of Alfred Stieglitz: Fifty Pioneers of Modern Photography|publisher=NY: Metropolitan Museum of Art|year=1978|pages=16–48}}&lt;/ref&gt; Through his self-study, he saw photography as an art form. In 1887, he wrote his very first article, "A Word or Two about Amateur Photography in Germany", for the new magazine ''The Amateur Photographer''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Alfred Stieglitz|journal=The Amateur Photographer|title=A or Two about Amateur Photography in Germany|issue=5|date=February 1887|pages=96–97}}&lt;/ref&gt; He then wrote articles on the technical and aesthetic aspects of photography for magazines in England and Germany.

[[File:Alfred_Stieglitz_-_The_Last_Joke_Bellagio,_1887.jpg|thumb|Alfred Stieglitz, ''The Last Joke, Bellagio'', 1887]]
He won first place for his photography, ''The Last Joke, Bellagio'', in 1887 from ''Amateur Photographer''. The next year he won both first and second prizes in the same competition, and his reputation began to spread as several German and British photographic magazines published his work.&lt;ref name="ASAM"&gt;{{cite book|author=Sue Davidson Lowe|title=Stieglitz: A Memoir/Biography|publisher=NY: Farrar Straus Giroux|year=1983|pages=19, 22–35, 181–200, 348–366}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1890, his sister Flora died while giving birth, and Stieglitz returned to New York.&lt;ref name="ALGO"/&gt;

== Career ==

===New York and the Camera Club (1891–1901)===
[[File:Stieglitz, Terminal, 1892.jpg|thumb|right|upright=1.3|''The Terminal'' (1893) by Alfred Stieglitz]]

Stieglitz considered himself an artist, but he refused to sell his photographs. His father purchased a small photography business for him so that he could earn a living in his chosen profession. Because he demanded high quality images and paid his employee high wages, the Photochrome Engraving Company rarely made a profit.&lt;ref name="ASAM" /&gt; He regularly wrote for ''The American Amateur Photographer'' magazine. He won awards for his photographs at exhibitions, including the joint exhibition of the [[Boston Camera Club]], Photographic Society of Philadelphia and the Society of Amateur Photographers of New York.

In late 1892, Stieglitz bought his first hand-held camera, a Folmer and Schwing 4×5 plate film camera,&lt;ref name="ASAM" /&gt; which he used to take two of his best known images, ''Winter, Fifth Avenue'' and ''The Terminal''. Prior to that he used a 8×10 plate film camera that required a tripod.

Stieglitz gained a reputation for his photography and his magazine articles about how photography is a form of art. In the spring of 1893, he became co-editor of ''The American Amateur Photographer''. In order to avoid the appearance of bias in his opinions and because Photochrome was now printing the [[photogravure]]s for the magazine, Stieglitz refused to draw a salary.&lt;ref name="ASAB" /&gt; He wrote most of the articles and reviews in the magazine, and was known for both his technical and his critical content.

[[File:Stieglitz-Winter.jpg|thumb|left|''Winter – Fifth Avenue'' (1893) by Alfred Stieglitz]]
On November 16, 1893, the 29 year-old Stieglitz married 20 year-old Emmeline Obermeyer, the sister of his close friend and business associate Joe Obermeyer and granddaughter of brewer [[Samuel Liebmann]]. They were married in New York City. Stieglitz later wrote that he did not love Emmy, as she was commonly known, when they were married and that their marriage was not consummated for at least a year.&lt;ref name="SBL" /&gt; Daughter of a wealthy brewery owner, she had inherited money from her father, a wealthy brewery owner and his father lost a great deal of money in the stock market.&lt;ref name="ASAB" /&gt; He came to regret his decision to marry Emmy, as she did not share his artistic and cultural interests. Stieglitz biographer Richard Whelan summed up their relationship by saying Stieglitz "resented her bitterly for not becoming his twin." Throughout his life Stieglitz maintained a fetish for younger women.&lt;ref name="ASAM" /&gt;

[[File:Stieglitz-Venetian Canal.jpg|thumb|right|''Venetian Canal'' (1894) by Alfred Stieglitz]]
In early 1894, Stieglitz and his wife took a delayed honeymoon to France, Italy and Switzerland. Stieglitz photographed extensively on the trip, producing some of his early famous images such as ''A Venetian Canal'', ''The Net Mender'' and ''A Wet Day on the Boulevard, Paris''. While in Paris, Stieglitz met French photographer [[Robert Demachy]], who became a lifelong correspondent and colleague. In London, Stieglitz met [[The Linked Ring]] founders [[George Davison (photographer)|George Davison]] and [[Alfred Horsley Hinton]], both of whom remained his friends and colleagues throughout much of his life.

Later in the year, after his return, Stieglitz was unanimously elected as one of the first two American members of The Linked Ring. Stieglitz saw this recognition as the impetus he needed to step up his cause of promoting artistic photography in the United States.&lt;ref name="SBL" /&gt; At the time there were two photographic clubs in New York, the Society of Amateur Photographers and the New York Camera Club. Stieglitz resigned from his position at the Photochrome Company and as editor of ''American Amateur Photographer'' and spent most of 1895 negotiating a merger of the two clubs.

In May 1896, the two organizations joined to form [[The Camera Club of New York]]. Although offered the organization's presidency, he became vice-president. He developed programs for the club and was involved in all aspects of the organization. He told journalist [[Theodore Dreiser]] he wanted to "make the club so large, its labors so distinguished and its authority so final that [it] may satisfactorily use its great prestige to compel recognition for the individual artists without and within its walls."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Theodore Dreiser|journal=Ainslee's|title=The Camera Club of New York|date=October 1899}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Stieglitz turned the Camera Club's current newsletter into a magazine, ''[[Camera Notes]]'', and was given full control over the new publication. Its first issue was published in July 1897. It was soon considered the finest photographic magazine in the world.&lt;ref name="ASCN"&gt;{{cite book|author=Christian A. Peterson|title=Alfred Stieglitz's Camera Notes|publisher=NY: Norton|year=1993|pages=9–60}}&lt;/ref&gt; Over the next four years Stieglitz used ''Camera Notes'' to champion his belief in photography as an art form by including articles on art and aesthetics next to prints by some of the leading American and European photographers. Critic [[Sadakichi Hartmann]] wrote "it seemed to me that artistic photography, the Camera Club and Alfred Stieglitz were only three names for one and the same thing."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Sadakichi Hartmann|journal=Photographic Times|title=The New York Camera Club|date=February 1900|pages=59}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He also continued to take his own photographs. Late in 1897, he hand-pulled the photogravures for a first portfolio of his own work, ''Picturesque Bits of New York and Other Studies''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Alfred Stieglitz|title=Picturesque Bits of New York and Other Studies|publisher=NY: R. H. Russell|year=1897}}&lt;/ref&gt; He continued to exhibit in shows in Europe and the U.S., and by 1898 his gained a solid reputation as a photographer. He was paid $75 ({{inflation|US|75|1898|fmt=eq}}) for his favorite print, ''Winter – Fifth Avenue''.&lt;ref name="Naef" /&gt; Ten of Stieglitz's prints were selected that year for the first Philadelphia Photographic Salon, where he met and then became friends of [[Gertrude Käsebier]] and [[Clarence Hudson White|Clarence H. White]].

On September 27, 1898, Stieglitz's daughter, [[Katherine Stieglitz|Katherine "Kitty"]], was born. Using Emmy's inheritance, the couple hired a governess, cook and a chambermaid. Stieglitz worked at the same pace as before the birth of his daughter, and as a result, the couple predominantly lived separate lives under the same roof.&lt;ref name="SBL" /&gt;

In November 1898, a group of photographers in Munich, Germany, mounted an exhibit of their work in conjunction with a show of graphic prints from artists that included [[Edvard Munch]] and [[Henri de Toulouse-Lautrec]]. They called themselves the "Secessionists", a term that Stieglitz latched onto for both its artistic and its social meanings. Four years later, he used this same name for a newly formed group of pictorial photographers that he organized in New York.

In May 1899, Stieglitz was given a one-man exhibition, consisting of eighty-seven prints, at the Camera Club. The strain of preparing for this show, coupled with the continuing efforts to produce ''Camera Notes'', took a toll on Stieglitz's health. To lessen his burden he brought in his friends [[Joseph Keiley]] and Dallet Fugeut, neither of whom were members of the Camera Club, as associate editors of ''Camera Notes''. Upset by this intrusion from outsiders, not to mention their own diminishing presence in the Club's publication, many of the older members of the Club began to actively campaign against Stieglitz's editorial authority. Stieglitz spent most of 1900 finding ways to outmaneuver these efforts, embroiling him in protracted administrative battles.&lt;ref name="ASAM" /&gt;

One of the few highlights of that year was Stieglitz's introduction to a new photographer, [[Edward Steichen]], at the First Chicago Photographic Salon. Steichen, originally a painter, he brought many of his artistic instincts to photography. The two became good friends and colleagues.

Due to the continued strain of managing the Camera Club, by the following year he collapsed in the first of several mental breakdowns.&lt;ref name="ASAM" /&gt; He spent much of the summer at the family's Lake George home, Oaklawn, recuperating. When he returned to New York, he announced his resignation as editor of ''Camera Notes''.&lt;ref name="ASAB" /&gt;

===The Photo-Secession and ''Camera Work'' (1902–1907)===

Photographer [[Eva Watson-Schütze]] urged him to establish an exhibition that would be judged solely by photographers&lt;ref name="WIH"&gt;{{cite book|author=William Innes Homer|title=Stieglitz and the Photo-Secession 1902|publisher=NY:Viking Studio|year=2002|pages=22, 24–25}}&lt;/ref&gt; who, unlike painters and other artists, knew about photography and its technical characteristics. In December 1901, he was invited by [[Charles DeKay]] of the [[National Arts Club]] to put together an exhibition in which Stieglitz would have "full power to follow his own inclinations."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Alfred Stieglitz|journal=Camera Notes|title=Exhibitions|date=April 1902|pages=5}}&lt;/ref&gt; Within two months Stieglitz had assembled a collection of prints from a close circle of his friends, which, in homage to the Munich photographers, he called the [[Photo-Secession]]. 

&lt;blockquote&gt;We are searching for the ultimate truth... We believe that if only people are taught to appreciate the beautiful side of their daily existence, to be aware of all the beauty which constantly surrounds them, they must gradually approach this ideal. For beauty is the ultimate truth, and truth means freedom."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=291 — The Little Gallery that Caught the Light|url= https://www.theattic.space/home-page-blogs/2017/11/17/291-the-little-gallery-that-caught-the-light |accessdate=27 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Stieglitz was not only declaring a secession from the general artistic restrictions of the era, but specifically from the official oversight of the Camera Club.&lt;ref name="PS"&gt;{{cite book|author=Robert Doty|title=Photo-Secession: Photography as Fine Art|publisher=Rochester, NY; George Eastman House|year=1960|pages=43}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The show opened at the Arts Club in early March 1902, and it was an immediate success.

He began formulating a plan to publish a completely independent magazine of pictorial photography to carry forth the artistic standards of the Photo-Secessionist. By July, he had fully resigned as editor of ''Camera Notes'', and one month later he published a prospectus for a new journal he called ''[[Camera Work]]''. He was determined it would be "the best and most sumptuous of photographic publications".&lt;ref name="ASAB"/&gt; The first issue was printed four months later, in December 1902, and like all of the subsequent issues it contained beautiful hand-pulled photogravures, critical writings on photography, aesthetics and art, and reviews and commentaries on photographers and exhibitions. ''Camera Work'' was "the first photographic journal to be visual in focus."&lt;ref name="Taschen"&gt;{{cite book|title=Camera Work: The Complete Photographs 1903-1917|publisher=Taschen|year=2008|pages=7, 16–18, 31–32}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Stieglitz was a perfectionist, and it showed in every aspect of ''Camera Work''. He advanced the art of [[photogravure]] printing by demanding unprecedentedly high standards for the prints in ''Camera Work''. The visual quality of the gravures was so high that when a set of prints failed to arrive for a Photo-Secession exhibition in Brussels, a selection of gravures from the magazine was hung instead. Most viewers assumed they were looking at the original photographs.&lt;ref name="ASAB"/&gt;

Throughout 1903, Stieglitz published ''Camera Work'' and worked to exhibit his own work and that of the Photo-Secessionists&lt;ref name="ASAM"/&gt; while dealing with the stresses of his home life.  [[Luxembourgish American]] photographer, [[Edward Steichen]], who later would curate the landmark exhibit [[The Family of Man]]; was the most frequently featured photographer in the magazine. Fuguet, Keiley, and Strauss, were associated editors although he brought on the same three associate editors he had at ''Camera Notes'', also worked at ''Camera Work'', but was involved in the details of the publication(?). Later he said that he alone individually wrapped and mailed some 35,000 copies of ''Camera Work'' over the course of its publication.&lt;ref name="ASAM"/&gt;

By 1904, Stieglitz was again mentally and physically exhausted and decided to take his family to Europe in May. He planned a grueling schedule of exhibitions, meetings and excursions and collapsed almost upon arrival in Berlin, where he spent more than a month recuperating. He spent much of the rest of 1904 photographing Germany while his family visited their relations there. On his way back to the U. S. Stieglitz stopped in London and met with leaders of the Linked Ring but was unable to convince them to set up a chapter of their organization in America (with Stieglitz as the director).

[[Image:Stieglitz-GoingtotheStart.jpg|thumb|right|''Going to the Start'' (1905) by Stieglitz]]
On November 25, 1905, the [[291 (art gallery)|Little Galleries of the Photo-Secession]]" opened on Fifth Avenue with one hundred prints by thirty-nine photographers. [[Edward Steichen]] had recommended and encourage Stieglitz, on his return from Europe, to lease out three rooms across from Steichen's apartment that the pair felt would be perfect to exhibit photography. The gallery became an instant success, with almost fifteen thousand visitors during its first season and, more importantly, print sales that totaled nearly $2,800.&lt;ref name="MAAA"&gt;{{cite book|author=Sarah Greenough|title=Modern Art and America: Alfred Stieglitz and His New York Galleries|publisher=Washington: National Gallery of Art|year=2000|pages=26–53}}&lt;/ref&gt; Work by his friend Steichen, who had an apartment in the same building, accounted for more than half of those sales.&lt;ref name="ASAB"/&gt;

Stieglitz continued to focus his efforts on photography, at the expense of his family. Emmy, who hoped she would one day earn Stieglitz's love, continued giving him an allowance from her inheritance.&lt;ref name="ASAM"/&gt;

In the October 1906 issue of ''Camera Work'', his friend Joseph Keiley said: "Today in America the real battle for which the Photo-Secession was established has been accomplished – the serious recognition of photography as an additional medium of pictorial expression."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Joseph Keiley|journal=Camera Work|title=The Photo-Secession Exhibit at the Pennsylvania Academy of Fine Arts|date=October 1906|pages=15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Two months later the 42 year-old Stieglitz met 28 year-old artist [[Pamela Colman Smith]], who wished to have her drawings and watercolors shown at his gallery. He decided to show her work because he thought it would be "highly instructive to compare drawings and photographs in order to judge photography's possibilities and limitations".&lt;ref name="MAAA"/&gt; Her show opened in January 1907, with far more visitors to the gallery than any of the previous photography shows, and soon all of her exhibited works were sold. Stieglitz, hoping to capitalize on the popularity of the show, took photographs of her art work and issued a separate portfolio of his platinum prints of her work.&lt;ref name="ASAB"/&gt;

[[File:Alfred Stieglitz (American - The Steerage - Google Art Project.jpg|thumb|right|Stieglitz's ''[[The Steerage]]'']]
In the late spring of 1907, Stieglitz collaborated on a series of photographic experiments with his friend [[Clarence Hudson White|Clarence H. White]]. They took several dozen photographs of two clothed and nude models and printed a selection using unusual techniques, including toning, waxing and drawing on platinum prints. According to Stieglitz, it overcame "the impossibility of the camera to do certain things."&lt;ref name="ASAB"/&gt;

He made less than $400 for the year due to declining ''Camera Work'' subscriptions and the gallery's low profit margin.&lt;ref name="ASAM"/&gt; For years, Emmy had maintained an extravagant lifestyle that included a full-time governess for Kitty and expensive European vacations. In spite of her father's concerns about his growing financial problems, the Stieglitz family and their governess once again sailed across the Atlantic.
[[File:Katherine Stieglitz autochrome.jpg|thumb|left|[[Katherine Stieglitz]], autochrome, ca. 1910]]

While on his way to Europe, Stieglitz took what is recognized not only as his signature image but also as one of the most important photographs of the 20th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Weber|first=Eva|title=Alfred Stieglitz|year=1994|publisher=Brompton Books Corporation|location=Greenwich, CT|isbn=0-517-10332-X|pages=6 (introduction)}}&lt;/ref&gt; Aiming his camera at the lower class passengers in the bow of the ship, he captured a scene he titled ''[[The Steerage]]''. He did not publish or exhibit it for four years.

While in Europe, Stieglitz saw the first commercial demonstration of the [[Autochrome Lumière]] color photography process, and soon he was experimenting with it in Paris with Steichen, [[Frank Eugene]] and [[Alvin Langdon Coburn]]. He took three of Steichen's Autochromes with him to Munich in order to have four-color reproductions made for insertion into a future issue of ''Camera Work''.

He was asked to resign from the Camera Club, but due to protests by other members he was reinstated as a life member. Just after he presented a groundbreaking show of [[Auguste Rodin]]'s drawings, his financial problems forced him to close the Little Galleries for a brief period, until February 1908, when it was reopened under the new name "[[291 (art gallery)|291]]".

Stieglitz deliberately interspersed exhibitions of what he knew would be controversial art, such as Rodin's sexually explicit drawings, with what Steichen called "understandable art", and with photographs. The intention was to "set up a dialogue that would enable 291 visitors to see, discuss and ponder the differences and similarities between artists of all ranks and types: between painters, draftsmen, sculptors and photographers; between European and American artists; between older or more established figures and younger, newer practitioners."&lt;ref name="ASKS"&gt;{{cite book|author=Sarah Greenough|title=Alfred Stieglitz: The Key Set|publisher=NY: Abrams|year=2002|pages=xi-xlix, 31, 558}}&lt;/ref&gt; During this same period the National Arts Club mounted a "Special Exhibition of Contemporary Art" that included photographs by Stieglitz, Steichen, Käsebier and White along with paintings by [[Mary Cassatt]], [[William Glackens]], [[Robert Henri]], [[James McNeill Whistler]] and others. This is thought to have been the first major show in the U.S. in which photographers were given equal ranking with painters.&lt;ref name="ASKS"/&gt;

For most of 1908 and 1909, Stieglitz spent his time creating shows at 291 and publishing ''Camera Work''. There were no photographs taken during this period that appear in the definitive catalog of his work, ''Alfred Stieglitz: The Key Set''.&lt;ref name="ASKS"/&gt;

In May 1909, Stieglitz's father Edward died, and in his will he left his son the then significant sum of $10,000 ({{inflation|US|10000|1909|fmt=eq}}). Stieglitz used this new infusion of cash to keep his gallery and ''Camera Work'' in business for the next several years.

During this period, Stieglitz met [[Marius de Zayas]], an energetic and charismatic artist from Mexico, who became one of his closest colleagues, assisting both with shows at the gallery and with introducing Stieglitz to new artists in Europe. As Stieglitz's reputation as a promoter of European modern art increased, he soon was approached by several new American artists hoping to have their works shown. Stieglitz was intrigued by their modern vision, within months [[Alfred Maurer]], [[John Marin]] and [[Marsden Hartley]] all had their works hanging on the walls of 291.

In 1910, Stieglitz was invited by the director of the [[Albright-Knox Art Gallery|Albright Art Gallery]] to organize a major show of the best of contemporary photography. Although an announcement of an open competition for the show was printed in ''Camera Work'', the fact that Stieglitz would be in charge of it generated a new round of attacks against him. An editorial in ''American Photography'' magazine claimed that Stieglitz could no longer "perceive the value of photographic work of artistic merit which does not conform to a particular style which is so characteristic of all exhibitions under his auspices. Half a generation ago this school [the Photo-Secession] was progressive, and far in advance of its time. Today it is not progressing, but is a reactionary force of the most dangerous type."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Frank Fraprie|journal=American Photography|title=untitled editorial|date=August 1910|page=476}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Stieglitz wrote to fellow photographer George Seeley "The reputation, not only of the Photo-Secession, but of photography is at stake, and I intend to muster all the forces available to win out for us."&lt;ref name="ASAB"/&gt; The exhibition opened in October with more than 600 photographs. Critics generally praised the beautiful aesthetic and technical qualities of the works. However, his critics found that the vast majority of the prints in the show were from the same photographers Stieglitz had known for years and whose works he had exhibited at 291. More than five hundred of the prints came from only thirty-seven photographers, including Steichen, Coburn, Seeley, White, [[F. Holland Day]], and Stieglitz himself.

In the January 1911 edition of ''Camera Work'', Stieglitz reprinted a review of the Buffalo show with disparaging words about White and Käsebier's photos. White never forgave Stieglitz. He started his own school of photography, and Käsebier and White co-founded the "Pictorial Photographers of America".

Throughout 1911 and early 1912, Stieglitz organized ground-breaking modern art exhibits at 291 and promoted new art along with photography in the pages of ''Camera Work''. By the summer of 1912, he was so enthralled with non-photographic art that he published an issue of ''Camera Work'' (August 1912) devoted solely to Matisse and Picasso.&lt;ref name="Taschen"/&gt;

Meyer|Agnes Meyer]], Alfred Stieglitz, [[John Barrett Kerfoot (photographer)|John Barrett Kerfoot]], [[John Marin]]]]
In late 1912, painters [[Walter Pach]], [[Arthur B. Davies]] and [[Walt Kuhn]] organized a modern art show, and Stieglitz lent a few modern art pieces from 291 to the show. He also agreed to be listed as an honorary vice-president of the exhibition along with [[Claude Monet]], [[Odilon Redon]], [[Mabel Dodge]] and [[Isabella Stewart Gardner]]. In February 1913, the watershed [[Armory Show]] opened in New York, and soon modern art was a major topic of discussion throughout the city. He saw the popularity of the show as a vindication of the work that he had been sponsoring at 291 for the past five years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ake.ege.edu.tr/en/jast/Number22/TedEversole.pdf|title=Alfred Stieglitz's ''Camera Work'' and the Early Cultivation of American Modernism|accessdate=2008-12-08|author=Ted Eversole|page=13}}&lt;/ref&gt; He mounted an exhibition of his own photographs at 291 to run at the same time as the Armory Show. He later wrote that allowing people to see both photographs and modern paintings at the same time "afforded the best opportunity to the student and public for a clearer understanding of the place and purpose of the two media."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Alfred Stieglitz|journal=Camera Work|title=Notes on '291'|date=June 1913|page=3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In January 1914, his closest friend and coworker Joseph Keiley died, which left him distraught for many weeks. He was also troubled by the outbreak of [[World War I]] for several reasons. He was concerned about the safety of family and friends in Germany. He needed to find a new printer for the photogravures for ''Camera Work'', which had been printed in Germany for many years. The war caused a significant downturn in the American economy and art became a luxury for many people. By the end of the year, Stieglitz was struggling to keep both 291 and ''Camera Work'' alive. He published the April issue of ''Camera Work'' in October, but it would be more than a year before he had the time and resources to publish the next issue.

[[File:Alfred and Emmeline O. Stieglitz-restored.jpg|thumb|left|[[Autochrome]] portrait of Stieglitz and his wife Emily, ca. 1915. While attributed to Stieglitz, image may well be the work of [[Edward Steichen]] or [[Frank Eugene]].]]

In the meantime Stieglitz's friends de Zayas, Paul de Haviland, and [[Agnes E. Meyer|Agnes Meyer]] convinced him that the solution to his problems was to take on a totally new project, something that would re-engage him in his interests. He published a new journal, called ''[[291 (journal)|291]]'' after his gallery, that intended to be the epitome of avant-garde culture. While it was an aesthetic triumph, it was a financial disaster and ceased publication after twelve issues.

During this period, Stieglitz became increasingly intrigued with a more modern visual aesthetics for photography. He became aware of what was going on in avant-garde painting and sculpture and found that pictorialism no longer represented the future – it was the past. He was influenced in part by painter [[Charles Sheeler]] and by photographer [[Paul Strand]]. In 1915, Strand, who had been coming to see shows at 291 for many years, introduced Stieglitz to a new photographic vision that was embodied by the bold lines of everyday forms. Stieglitz was one of the first to see the beauty and grace of Strand's style, and he gave Strand a major exhibit at 291. He also devoted almost the entire last issue of ''Camera Work'' to his photographs.

In January 1916, Stieglitz was shown a portfolio of [[Charcoal drawings by Georgia O'Keeffe from 1915|charcoal drawings]] by a young artist named [[Georgia O'Keeffe]]. Stieglitz was so taken by her art that without meeting O'Keeffe or even getting her permission to show her works he made plans to exhibit her work at 291. The first that O'Keeffe heard about any of this was from another friend who saw her drawings in the gallery in late May of that year. She finally met Stieglitz after going to 291 and chastising him for showing her work without her permission.&lt;ref name="ASAB"/&gt;

Soon thereafter O'Keeffe met Paul Strand, and for several months she and Strand exchanged increasingly romantic letters. When Strand told his friend Stieglitz about his new yearning, Stieglitz responded by telling Strand about his own infatuation with O'Keeffe. Gradually Strand's interest waned, and Stieglitz's escalated. By the summer of 1917 he and O'Keeffe were writing each other "their most private and complicated thoughts",&lt;ref name="GOAL"&gt;{{cite book|author=Roaxnna Robinson|title=Georgia O'Keeffe: A Life|publisher=NY: Harper|year=1989|pages=195–96, 278–279}}&lt;/ref&gt; and it was clear that something very intense was developing.

The year 1917 marked the end of an era in Stieglitz's life and the beginning of another. In part because of changing aesthetics, the changing times brought on by the war and because of his growing relationship with O'Keeffe, he no longer had the interest or the resources to continue what he had been doing for the past decade. Within the period of a few months, he disbanded what was left of the Photo-Secession, ceased publishing ''Camera Work'' and closed the doors of 291. It was also clear to him that his marriage to Emmy was over. He had finally found "his twin", and nothing would stand in his way of the relationship he had wanted all of his life.

===O'Keeffe and modern art (1918–1924)===
[[Image:Stieglitz, Georgia O'Keeffe, 1918.jpg|thumb|A Stieglitz portrait of [[Georgia O'Keeffe]]]]
In early June 1918, O'Keeffe moved to New York from Texas after Stieglitz promised he would provide her with a quiet studio where she could paint. Within a month he took the first of many nude photographs of her at his family's apartment while his wife Emmy was away, but she returned while their session was still in progress. She had suspected something was going on between the two for a while, and told him to stop seeing her or get out.&lt;ref name="ASAM"/&gt; Stieglitz left and immediately found a place in the city where he and O'Keeffe could live together. They slept separately for more than two weeks. By the end of July they were in the same bed together, and by mid-August when they visited Oaklawn "they were like two teenagers in love. Several times a day they would run up the stairs to their bedroom, so eager to make love that they would start taking their clothes off as they ran."&lt;ref name="ASAB"/&gt;

Once he was out of their apartment Emmy had a change of heart. Due to the legal delays caused by Emmy and her brothers, it would be six more years before the divorce was finalized. During this period Stieglitz and O'Keeffe continued to live together, although she would go off on her own from time to time to create art.  Stieglitz used their times apart to concentrate on his photography and promotion of modern art.

O'Keeffe was the muse Stieglitz had always wanted. He photographed O'Keeffe obsessively between 1918 and 1925 in what was the most prolific period in his entire life. During this period he produced more than 350 mounted prints of O'Keeffe that portrayed a wide range of her character, moods and beauty. He shot many close-up studies of parts of her body, especially her hands either isolated by themselves or near her face or hair. O'Keeffe biographer Roxanna Robinson states that her "personality was crucial to these photographs; it was this, as much as her body, that Stieglitz was recording."&lt;ref name="GOAL"/&gt;

In 1920, Stieglitz was invited by Mitchell Kennerly of the Anderson Galleries in New York to put together a major exhibition of his photographs. In early 1921, he hung the first one-man exhibit of his photographs since 1913. Of the 146 prints he put on view, only 17 had been seen before. Forty-six were of O'Keeffe, including many nudes, but she was not identified as the model on any of the prints.&lt;ref name="ASAB"/&gt; It was in the catalog for this show that Stieglitz made his famous declaration: "I was born in Hoboken. I am an American. Photography is my passion. The search for Truth my obsession." What is less known is that he conditioned this statement by following it with these words:

&lt;blockquote&gt;PLEASE NOTE: In the above STATEMENT the following, fast becoming "obsolete", terms do not appear: ART, SCIENCE, BEAUTY, RELIGION, every ISM, ABSTRACTION, FORM, PLASTICITY, OBJECTIVITY, SUBJECTIVITY, OLD MASTERS, MODERN ART, PSYCHOANALYSIS, AESTHETICS, PICTORIAL PHOTOGRAPHY, DEMOCRACY, CEZANNE, "291", PROHIBITION. The term TRUTH did creep in but it may be kicked out by any one.&lt;ref name="DN"&gt;{{cite book|author=Dorothy Norman|title=Alfred Stieglitz: An American Seer|publisher=NY: Random House|year=1973|pages=142, 225}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In 1922, Stieglitz organized a large show of [[John Marin]]'s paintings and etching at the Anderson Galleries, followed by a huge auction of nearly two hundred paintings by more than forty American artists, including O'Keeffe. Energized by this activity, he began one of his most creative and unusual undertakings – photographing a series of cloud studies simply for their form and beauty. He said:

&lt;blockquote&gt;I wanted to photograph clouds to find out what I had learned in forty years about photography. Through clouds to put down my philosophy of life – to show that (the success of) my photographs (was) not due to subject matter – not to special trees or faces, or interiors, to special privileges – clouds were there for everyone…&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Alfred Stieglitz|journal=Amateur Photographer and Photography|title=How I came to Photograph Clouds|page=255|date=19 September 1923}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

By late summer he had created a series he called "Music – A Sequence of Ten Cloud Photographs". Over the next twelve years he would take hundreds of photographs of clouds without any reference points of location or direction. These are generally recognized as the first intentionally abstract photographs, and they remain some of his most powerful photographs. He would come refer to these photographs as ''[[Equivalents]]''.

Stieglitz's mother Hedwig died in November 1922, and as he did with his father he buried his grief in his work. He spent time with Paul Strand and his new wife [[Rebecca Salsbury James|Rebecca (Beck)]], reviewed the work of another newcomer named [[Edward Weston]] and began organizing a new show of O'Keeffe's work. Her show opened in early 1923, and Stieglitz spent much of the spring marketing her work. Eventually twenty of her paintings sold for more than $3,000. In the summer, O'Keeffe once again took off for the seclusion of the Southwest, and for a while Stieglitz was alone with Beck Strand at Lake George. He took a series of nude photos of her, and soon he became infatuated with her. They had a brief physical affair before O'Keeffe returned in the fall. O'Keeffe could tell what had happened, but since she did not see Stieglitz's new lover as a serious threat to their relationship she let things pass. Six years later she would have her own affair with Beck Strand in New Mexico.&lt;ref name="OSAR"&gt;{{cite book |first=Benita|last=Eisler|title=O'Keeffe and Stieglitz: An American Romance |publisher=NY: Doubleday|year=1991|pages=380–392, 428–429, 478, 493}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1924, Stieglitz's divorce was finally approved by a judge, and within four months he and O'Keeffe married in a small, private ceremony at Marin's house. They went home without a reception or honeymoon. O'Keeffe said later that they married in order to help soothe the troubles of Stieglitz's daughter Kitty, who at that time was being treated in a sanatorium for depression and hallucinations.&lt;ref name="GOAL"/&gt; For the rest of their lives together, their relationship was, as biographer Benita Eisler characterized it, "a collusion ... a system of deals and trade-offs, tacitly agreed to and carried out, for the most part, without the exchange of a word. Preferring avoidance to confrontation on most issues, O'Keeffe was the principal agent of collusion in their union."&lt;ref name="OSAR"/&gt;

In the coming years O'Keeffe would spend much of her time painting in New Mexico, while Stieglitz rarely left New York except for summers at Lake George. O'Keeffe later said "Stieglitz was a [[hypochondriac]] and couldn't be more than 50 miles from a doctor."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|journal=Art News|title=Bringing Modernism to Cyberspace|volume=108|issue=1|date=January 2009|page=38}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At the end of 1924, Stieglitz donated 27 photographs to the [[Boston Museum of Fine Arts]]. It was the first time a major museum included photographs in its permanent collection. In the same year he was awarded the [[Royal Photographic Society]]'s Progress Medal for advancing photography and received an Honorary Fellowship of the Society&lt;ref&gt;Progress Medal of the Royal Photographic Society http://www.rps.org/about/awards/history-and-recipients/progress-medal Accessed May 15, 2018&lt;/ref&gt;

===The Intimate Gallery and An American Place (1925–1937)===
In 1925, Stieglitz was invited by the Anderson Galleries to put together one of the largest exhibitions of American art, entitled ''Alfred Stieglitz Presents Seven Americans: 159 Paintings, Photographs, and Things, Recent and Never Before Publicly Shown by Arthur G. Dove, Marsden Hartley, John Marin, Charles Demuth, Paul Strand, Georgia O'Keeffe and Alfred Stieglitz.'' Only one small painting by O'Keeffe was sold during the three-week exhibit.&lt;ref name="MAAA"/&gt;

Soon after, Stieglitz was offered the continued use of one of the rooms at the Anderson Galleries, which he used for a series of exhibitions by some of the same artists in the Seven Americans show. In December 1925, he opened his new gallery, publicly called "The Intimate Gallery" but referred to by Stieglitz as "The Room" because of its small size. Over the next four years he put together sixteen shows of works by Marin, Dove, Hartley, O'Keeffe and Strand, along with individual exhibits by [[Gaston Lachaise]], [[Oscar Bluemner]] and [[Francis Picabia]]. During this time Stieglitz cultivated a relationship with influential new art collector [[Duncan Phillips (art collector)|Duncan Phillips]], who purchased several works through The Intimate Gallery.

In 1927, Stieglitz became infatuated with the 22 year-old [[Dorothy Norman]], who then volunteered at the gallery and they fell in love. Norman was married and had a child, but she came to the gallery almost every day.

O'Keeffe accepted an offer by [[Mabel Dodge]] to come to New Mexico for the summer. Stieglitz took advantage of her time away to begin photographing Norman, and he began teaching her the technical aspects of printing as well. When Norman had a second child she missed only about two months before returning to the gallery on a regular basis.&lt;ref name="ASAM"/&gt; Within a short time they became lovers, but even after their physical affair diminished a few years later, they continued to work together whenever O'Keeffe was not around until Stieglitz died in 1946.

In early 1929, Stieglitz was told that the building that housed the Room would be torn down later in the year. After a last show of Demuth's work in May, he retreated to Lake George for the summer, exhausted and depressed. The Strands raised nearly sixteen thousand dollars for a new gallery for Stieglitz, who reacted harshly, saying it was time for "young ones" to do some of the work he had been shouldering for so many years.&lt;ref name="MAAA"/&gt; Although Stieglitz eventually apologized and accepted their generosity, the incident marked the beginning of the end of their long and close relationship.

In the late fall, Stieglitz returned to New York. On December 15, two weeks after his sixty-fifth birthday,  he opened, "An American Place", the largest gallery he had ever managed. It had the first darkroom he had in the city. Previously he had borrowed other darkrooms or worked only when he was at Lake George.  He continued showing group or individual shows of his friends Marin, Demuth, Hartley, Dove and Strand for the next sixteen years. O'Keeffe received at least one major exhibition each year. He fiercely controlled access to her works and incessantly promoted her even when critics gave her less than favorable reviews. Often during this time they would only see each other during the summer, when it was too hot in her New Mexico home, but they wrote to each other almost weekly with the fervor of soul mates.&lt;ref name="OSAR"/&gt;

In 1932, Stieglitz mounted a forty-year retrospective of 127 of his works at The Place. He included all of his most famous photographs, but he also purposely chose to include recent photos of O'Keeffe, who, because of her years in the Southwest sun, looked older than her forty-five years, next to portraits of his young lover Norman. It was one of the few times he acted spitefully to O'Keeffe in public, and it might have been as a result of their increasingly intense arguments in private about his control over her art.&lt;ref name="OSAR"/&gt;

Later that year he mounted a show of O'Keeffe's works next to some amateurish paintings on glass by Becky Strand. He did not publish a catalog of the show, which the Strands took as an insult. Paul Strand never forgave Stieglitz. He said "The day I walked into the Photo-Secession 291 [sic] in 1907 was a great moment in my life… but the day I walked out of An American Place in 1932 was not less good. It was fresh air and personal liberation from something that had become, for me at least, second-rate, corrupt and meaningless."&lt;ref name="OSAR"/&gt;

In 1936, Stieglitz returned briefly to his photographic roots by mounting one of the first exhibitions of photos by [[Ansel Adams]] in New York City.  The show was successful and [[David McAlpin]] bought eight Adams photos.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book  | last = Gray | first = Andrea | title = Ansel Adams: An American Place, 1936  | publisher = [[Center for Creative Photography]] | year = 1982 | location = [[Tucson]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;  He also put on one of the first shows of [[Eliot Porter]]'s work two years later. Stieglitz, considered the "godfather of modern photography", encouraged [[Todd Webb]] to develop his own style and immerse himself in the medium.&lt;ref name=twsOctBEnjh&gt;{{cite web |author= Staff writer |title= Todd Webb (1905-2000) |publisher= ''Luxury Bazaar'' |quote= Webb soon developed his own unique style of photographing and was further encouraged by Alfred Stieglitz, the often considered "Godfather of modern photography," to immerse himself in the medium. |year= 2010 |url= http://www.luxurybazaar.com/subcategories/subid_1019_Webb__Todd.html |accessdate= 2010-10-12 |deadurl= yes |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20101231114543/http://www.luxurybazaar.com/subcategories/subid_1019_Webb__Todd.html |archivedate= 2010-12-31 |df=  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The next year the [[Cleveland Museum of Art]] mounted the first major exhibition of Stieglitz's work outside of his own galleries, but he worked himself into exhaustion making sure that each print was perfect. O'Keeffe spent most of the year in New Mexico.

===Last years (1938–1946)===
In early 1938, Stieglitz suffered a serious heart attack, one of six coronary or angina attacks that would strike him over the next eight years, each of which left him increasingly weakened. During his absences, Dorothy Norman managed the gallery.  O'Keeffe remained in her Southwest home from spring to fall of this period.

In the summer of 1946, Stieglitz suffered a fatal stroke and went into a coma. O'Keeffe returned to New York and found Dorothy Norman was in his hospital room. She left and O'Keeffe was with him when he died.&lt;ref name="OSAR"/&gt; According to his wishes, a simple funeral was attended by twenty of his closest friends and family members. Stieglitz was cremated, and, with his niece Elizabeth Davidson, O'Keeffe took his ashes to Lake George and "put him where he could hear the water."&lt;ref name="OSAR"/&gt; The day after the funeral, O'Keeffe took control of An American Place.&lt;ref name="ASAB"/&gt;

==Key set==
Stieglitz produced more than 2,500 mounted photographs over his career. After his death, O'Keeffe assembled a set of what she considered the best of his photographs that he had personally mounted. In some cases she included slightly different versions of the same image, and these series are invaluable for their insights about Stieglitz's aesthetic composition. In 1949, she donated the first part of what she called the "key set" of 1,317 Stieglitz photographs to the [[National Gallery of Art]] in Washington, DC. In 1980, she added to the set another 325 photographs taken by Stieglitz of her, including many nudes. Now numbering 1,642 photographs, it is the largest, most complete collection of Stieglitz's work anywhere in the world. In 2002 the National Gallery published a two-volume, 1,012-page catalog that reproduced the complete key set along with detailed annotations about each photograph.&lt;ref name="ASKS" /&gt;

==Legacy==
*"Alfred Stieglitz (1864–1946) is perhaps the most important figure in the history of visual arts in America. That is certainly ''not'' to say that he was the greatest artist America has ever produced. Rather, through his many roles – as a photographer, as a discoverer and promoter of photographers and of artists in other media, and as a publisher, patron, and collector – he had a greater impact on American art than any other person has had."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=Richard|last=Whelan|title=Stieglitz on Photography: His Selected Essays and Notes|publisher=NY: Aperture|year=2000|page=ix}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*"Alfred Stieglitz had the multifold abilities of a Renaissance man. A visionary of enormously wide perspective, his accomplishments were remarkable, his dedication awe-inspiring. A photographer of genius, a publisher of inspiration, a writer of great ability, a gallery owner and exhibition organizer of both photographic and modern art exhibitions, a catalyst and a charismatic leader in the photographic and art worlds for over thirty years, he was, necessarily, a passionate, complex, driven and highly contradictory character, both prophet and martyr. The ultimate maverick, he inspired great love and great hatred in equal measure."&lt;ref name="Taschen"/&gt;
*Eight of the nine highest prices ever paid at auction for Stieglitz photographs (as of 2008) are images of Georgia O'Keeffe. The highest-priced photograph, a 1919 palladium print of ''Georgia O'Keeffe (Hands)'',  realized US$1.47 million at auction in February 2006. At the same sale, ''Georgia O'Keeffe Nude'', another 1919 print by Stieglitz, sold for $1.36 million.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.edwardcartergalleries.com/archives/000101.php Photograph sale breaks world record] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090226045111/http://www.edwardcartergalleries.com/archives/000101.php |date=February 26, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
*A large number of his works are held at the [[Minneapolis Institute of Art]]. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://collections.artsmia.org/search/artist:%22Alfred%20Stieglitz%22|title=artist:"Alfred Stieglitz" {{!}} Minneapolis Institute of Art|access-date=2018-02-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Quotes==
*"Photography is a fad well-nigh on its last legs, thanks principally to the bicycle craze."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=none|author=Alfred Stieglitz|journal=American Annual of Photography|year=1897|pages=56}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*"I have always been a great believer in ''today''. Most people live either in the past or in the future, so that they really never live at all. So many people are busy worrying about the future of art or society, they have no time to preserve what ''is''. Utopia is in the moment. Not in some future time, some other place, but in the here and now, or else it is nowhere."&lt;ref name="DN"/&gt;
*"Nearly right is child's play."&lt;ref name="MAAA"/&gt;
*"Photography is not an art. Neither is painting, nor sculpture, literature or music. They are only different media for the individual to express his aesthetic feelings… You do not have to be a painter or a sculptor to be an artist. You may be a shoemaker. You may be creative as such. And, if so, you are a greater artist than the majority of the painters whose work is shown in the art galleries of today."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Alfred Stieglitz|journal=New York Sun|title=Is Photography a Failure?|date=March 14, 1922|pages=5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''American Mushroom Institute''' is the [[industry trade group]] for the [[United States|U.S.]] [[mushroom]] industry.

In 2007 the Institute commissioned Chester County, Pa., author [[Bruce Mowday]] to compile a photographic history of the local industry. ''Chester County Mushroom Farming'' (Arcadia) was published in 2008.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2614">'''Ante Šupuk''' (21 August 1838 – 11 May 1904&lt;ref name="HE"&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|url=http://www.enciklopedija.hr/natuknica.aspx?id=60039|title=Šupuk, Ante|work=[[Croatian Encyclopedia]]|publisher=[[Miroslav Krleža Institute of Lexicography]]|language=hr|accessdate=22 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;) was a [[Croatian people|Croatian]] politician and entrepreneur who served as a mayor of [[Šibenik]]. In 1895 he built the [[Jaruga Hydroelectric Power Plant]] as one of the world's first [[hydroelectric power plant]]s, and connected it to a lighting system using [[alternating current]]. It was the first of its kind in [[Dalmatia]] and [[Croatia]].

Ante Šupuk was a generally influential mayor of Šibenik, the first Croat mayor to be elected under universal suffrage in 1872. He held the office in three periods: 1873–1882, 1886–1892, and 1896–1903.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sibenskileksikon.com/cms_view.asp?articleID=170 |title=Šibenski leksikon - Devetorica najčuvenijih poteštata |work=Šibenska početnica u deset lekcija |author=Ivo Jakovljević |year=2008 |language=Croatian |accessdate=2010-04-03 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110716064532/http://www.sibenskileksikon.com/cms_view.asp?articleID=170 |archivedate=2011-07-16 }}&lt;/ref&gt; During his tenure, the city built a number of features: a railroad connection (1877), waterworks (1879), a sewer system, and a new harbor, a new hospital building (1883).&lt;ref name="HE"/&gt;

In 1893, Šupuk and one Vjekoslav Meichsner started a business and obtained a license to use the waters of river [[Krka (Croatia)|Krka]], and in 1894 they obtained permission to set up electrical power lines on municipal property in order to start lighting the streets with electric power. The construction of the [[Jaruga Hydroelectric Power Plant]] started in 1894 and lasted for 16 months. It had a two-phase generator that produced 0.6&amp;nbsp;MW of electric power. It was connected to the city with an {{convert|11|km|mi|abbr=on}} long 3&amp;nbsp;kV power line, where it was transformed to 110&amp;nbsp;V. On August 28, 1895 the first electric [[street light]]s lit up in Šibenik. This achievement made Šibenik the third city in the world with [[alternating current]]-powered street lights. In 1904, Šupuk's company built a new power plant, Jaruga II, still operational today.&lt;ref name="HE"/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3021">'''BS 25999''' was [[BSI Group|BSI's]] standard in the field of [[Business continuity planning|Business Continuity Management]] (BCM). It was withdrawn in 2012 (part 2) and 2013 (part 1) following the publication of the international standards [[ISO 22301]] -  ″Societal Security — Business continuity management systems — Requirements″ and [[ISO 22313]] - ″Societal Security — Business continuity management systems — Guidance″

Upon its publication in 2007 BS 25999 replaced PAS 56, a [[Publicly Available Specification]], published in 2003 on the same subject.

==Structure==
BS 25999 was a Business Continuity Management (BCM) standard published by the British Standards Institution (BSI).

It had two parts;

* Part 1, "BS 25999-1:2006 Business Continuity Management. Code of Practice", took the form of general guidance on the processes, principles and terminology recommended for BCM.
* Part 2, "BS 25999-2:2007 Specification for Business Continuity Management", specified a set of requirements for implementing, operating and improving a BCM System (BCMS).

==Timelines==
The first part of BS 25999 (BS 25999-1:2006) was published by the [[BSI Group|British Standards Institution]] in December 2006. The second part of BS 25999 (BS 25999-2:2007) was published in November 2007.

BS 25999-2 was withdrawn in November 2012 having been replaced by the International Standard, ISO 22301. BS 25999-1 was withdrawn in early 2013 having been replaced by ISO 22313.

==Development==
Both parts of the standard contributed significantly to the international standards that succeeded then and to the development of other national and international standards (such as ASIS/BSI BCM.01:2010).

==Other related standards==
There are a number of similar worldwide standards:

North America - Published by the National Fire Protection Association
NFPA 1600: Standard on Disaster/Emergency Management and Business Continuity Programs.

ASIS/BSI BCM.01:2010 Business Continuity Management Systems: Requirements with Guidance for Use. Published in December 2010 and developed jointly between ASIS and BSI for North America

Australia - Published by [[Standards Australia]]

The company was founded in 2005 by Mark Bisnow, a [[Washington, D.C.|DC]] lawyer, business executive, and radio talk show host, who had become known for irreverent "Bisnow on Business" radio spots on the local all-news station and active involvement in local business organizations and philanthropies.&lt;ref name=wash06&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.washingtonian.com/articles/work-education/the-unsinkable-mark-bisnow/| title=The Unsinkable Mark Bisnow| date=August 1, 2006| author=Leslie Milk| publisher=Washingtonian| accessdate=February 20, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=wpost10&gt;{{cite web| url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2010/01/03/AR2010010301686.html| title=Bisnow brings other young entrepreneurs together in Summit Series| date=January 4, 2010| author=Annie Gowen| publisher=The Washington Post| accessdate=February 20, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bisnow wanted to take advantage of the new economics and reading habits of the [[Internet age]] to provide timelier, lighter, and more personality-focused news fare than traditionally available, and deliver it to niche business audiences.&lt;ref name=wash06/&gt;

Elliot Bisnow, Mark Bisnow's son, helped the company redesign the format of its newsletters and as a result he later became a member of the board.{{citation needed|date=February 2016}} Mark Bisnow was named Chairman when he turned over the [[Chief executive officer|CEO]] position to Ryan Begelman, previously the [[Chief operating officer|COO]] of Bisnow&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.washingtoncitypaper.com/blogs/citydesk/2013/04/08/mark-bisnow-of-bisnow-fame-steps-down-as-ceo/| title=Mark Bisnow, of Bisnow Fame, Steps Down as CEO| date=April 8, 2013| author=Will Sommer| publisher=Washington City Paper| accessdate=February 20, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; and also co-founder of [[Summit Series (conference)|Summit Series]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.wired.co.uk/magazine/archive/2013/10/start/a-startup-with-high-ambitions Startup Summit Group buys a mountain].

[[File:Persen.JPG|thumb|Hydraulic press - 400T]]

A '''brake''' is a metalworking [[machine]] that allows the [[Bending (metalworking)|bending]] of [[sheet metal]]. A cornice brake only allows for simple bends and creases, while a box-and-pan brake also allows one to form box and pan shapes. It is also known as a '''bending machine''' or '''bending brake''' or in Britain as a '''sheet metal folder''' or just a '''folder'''.

==Description==
The brake consists of a flat surface onto which the material is placed, and a [[Clamp (tool)|clamping bar]] which will come down and hold the material firmly during the bend. This clamping action may be manual, automatic or operated using a foot pedal. The front, gate-like, plate of the machine is hinged and may be lifted, forcing the material extended over a straight edge to bend to follow the plate. 

The bends can be to any [[angle]] up to a practical limit of about 120 [[degree (angle)|degree]]s, somewhat more in the case of a bar folder. If the area to be bent is narrow enough, a sharper bend (e.g., for a hem) can be made by inserting the bend under the clamping bar and lowering it.

===Box-and-pan brake===
In a box-and-pan brake (also known as a finger brake&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Aviation Structural Mechanic (H&amp;S) 3&amp;2 - How airplanes are built and how to maintain them|url=http://navyaviation.tpub.com/14018/css/Box-And-Pan-Brake-536.htm|page=516}}&lt;/ref&gt;), the clamping bar includes several removable blocks, which may be removed and rearranged to permit bending of restricted areas of a piece of sheet metal or of already partially formed pieces.

After bending, a box or pan form is then completed by [[screw]], [[solder]], [[welding|weld]], [[rivet]], or other metal fixing process.

===Bar folder===
This is a simplified brake, usually much smaller than cornice or box-and-pan brakes. Typically, a single handle both clamps the workpiece and makes the bend, in a single motion, but the depth is usually much less than what a cornice or box-and-pan brake can handle.

===Press brake===
{{Main|Press brake}}

This is a more complex tool that forms predetermined bends by clamping the workpiece between a matching punch and die.

==Sizes==
Brakes come in sizes suitable for light [[aluminum]] or [[brass]] for small boxes and operated by hand, up to industrial sized and counterweighted hand operated or [[Hydraulic machinery|hydraulic machines]] suitable for large sheets of [[steel]].

'''Carlos Humberto Cascos''' (born September 18, 1952) is an American [[Certified Public Accountant]] and [[politician]] who was the 110th [[Secretary of State of Texas]].  He was appointed by his fellow [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]], [[governor of Texas|Governor]] [[Greg Abbott]], and was confirmed by the [[Texas State Senate]] on February 18, 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |date=February 18, 2015 |title=Carlos Cascos confirmed as Texas Secretary of State |url=http://www.sos.state.tx.us/about/newsreleases/2015/021815.shtml |newspaper=Texas Secretary of State |location=[[Austin, Texas]] |access-date=May 23, 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==

Cascos was born in the city of [[Matamoros, Tamaulipas|Matamoros]] in the Mexican state of [[Tamaulipas]]. He emigrated to the United States as a child and became a permanent resident and citizen during adolescence.&lt;ref name=austinas&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.statesman.com/news/news/state-regional-govt-politics/gov-elect-abbott-names-mexican-born-county-judge-s/nh5Sj/|title=Greg Abbott names Mexican-born county judge secretary of state|author=Jonathan Tilove|date=November 11, 2014|publisher=''[[Austin American-Statesman]]''|accessdate=December 4, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cascos studied at the [[University of Texas at Austin]]. He and his wife, Aurora Candida G. Cascos (born 1953), have two daughters, Andrea and Cassandra.&lt;ref name=intelius&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.intelius.com/results.php?ReportType=1&amp;formname=name&amp;qf=Carlos&amp;qmi=&amp;qn=Cascos&amp;qcs=Brownsville%2C+TX&amp;focusfirst=1|title=Carlos Humberto Cascos|publisher=intelius.com|accessdate=December 4, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He is also currently the CPA at the Brownsville law firms of Pattillo, Brown &amp; Hill and John T. Floyd.&lt;ref name=intelius/&gt;

==Political life==

Cascos was elected [[county judge]] of [[Cameron County, Texas|Cameron County]] in far [[South Texas]]  in November 2006, when he unseated the 12-year incumbent, [[Gilberto Hinojosa]], who in 2012 became the current Texas [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic]] state party chairman. In tapping Cascos for Secretary of State, Abbott said that Cascos has "proven leadership experience. [He is] someone who understands how government works, someone who can cultivate strong bonds along the border as well as someone who can advance Texas' interests both at home and abroad."&lt;ref name=cascosselection&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.texastribune.org/2014/11/11/abbott-says-he-will-name-cascos-secretary-state/|title=Abbott Says He Will Name Cascos as Secretary of State|author=John Reynolds and Reeve Hamilton|date=November 11, 2014|publisher=''[[The Texas Tribune]]''|accessdate=December 4, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Abbott added, "He is a person I have known for years and whose judgment I trust.".&lt;ref name=austinas/&gt;

Abbott announced Cascos's selection on November 11, 2014, one week after Abbott's own victory over [[Wendy Davis (politician)|Wendy R. Davis]] for governor and Cascos's companion triumph for a third term as the [[county judge]] of [[Cameron County, Texas|Cameron County]] in far [[South Texas]]. Abbott polled 42 percent of the vote in traditionally Democratic Cameron County. Cascos defeated the Democrat Joe Rivera, the outgoing Cameron County clerk. Cascos will succeed [[Nandita Berry]], the eighth person to hold the position of secretary of state since 2000 under the outgoing administration of Governor [[Rick Perry]]. Berry will step down after a full year in office to return to private life in [[Houston, Texas|Houston]].&lt;ref name=cascosselection/&gt;

Cascos said that as secretary of state he would develop a comprehensive water plan and represent Texas in consultations with [[Mexico]] regarding [[Treaty|treaties]] impacting the use of the [[Rio Grande]]. He also plans to seek a role for American companies in the development of an ongoing energy boom in northern Mexico.&lt;ref name=cascosselection/&gt;

In 2004, Governor Perry appointed Cascos to the Texas Public Safety Commission. After he became county judge, Perry named Cascos as the presiding officer of the Texas Border Security Council.&lt;ref name=cascosselection/&gt;

When they were in office both Solchaga and his predecessor Miguel Boyer implemented economic policies based the orthodox liberal ideas, and the social outcomes of these policies were largely neglected.&lt;ref name=gil1992&gt;{{cite journal|last=Gillespie|first=Richard|title=Factionalism in the Spanish Socialist Party|journal=Working Papers Barcelona|year=1992|issue=59|url=http://ddd.uab.cat/pub/worpap/1992/hdl_2072_1423/ICPS59.pdf|accessdate=7 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Solchaga continued Boyer's moderation and [[Orthodox economics|orthodox economy approach]].&lt;ref name=wson1994&gt;{{cite book|author=John Williamson|title=The Political Economy of Policy Reform|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=cm-3mnvjEl8C&amp;pg=PA198|accessdate=8 July 2013|date=January 1994|publisher=Peterson Institute|isbn=978-0-88132-195-1|page=198}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was partly because they did not fit into the socialist mould the government projected.&lt;ref name=gil1994&gt;{{cite book|author=Richard Gillespie|title=Mediterranean Politics|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=UpC4QJP66HUC&amp;pg=PA173|accessdate=8 July 2013|year=1994|publisher=Fairleigh Dickinson Univ Press|isbn=978-0-8386-3609-1|page=173}}&lt;/ref&gt; Their priority was to reduce inflation using steps to control the money supply, which reinforced the high levels of interest and a strong currency.&lt;ref name=gil1994/&gt; In addition, like Boyer he objected the approach and views of [[Alfonso Guerra]], then deputy prime minister.&lt;ref name=holman2012&gt;{{cite book|author=Otto Holman|title=Integrating Southern Europe: EC Expansion and the Transnationalization of Spain|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=F8KUPvmJvVMC&amp;pg=PA1994-IA35|accessdate=18 July 2013|date=6 December 2012|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-1-134-80356-9|page=1994}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Brown is well known for his time with the [[World Wrestling Entertainment|World Wrestling Federation]] between 1997 and 2003 and also in 2008. There, he held the [[WWE Intercontinental Championship|WWF Intercontinental Championship]] [[List of WWF Intercontinental Champions|once]] and the [[WWE European Championship|WWF European Championship]] [[List of WWE European Champions|four times]].&lt;ref name=WWEbio&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wwe.com/superstars/raw/dlobrown/bio/|accessdate=2008-08-23|title=D'Lo Brown's WWE Profile|publisher=[[World Wrestling Entertainment]] |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20080822035147/http://www.wwe.com/superstars/raw/dlobrown/bio/ |archivedate = 2008-08-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; He is also known for his appearances in [[Total Nonstop Action Wrestling]], where he held the [[NWA World Tag Team Championship]], [[Ring of Honor]] and in [[Japan]] with the promotions [[All Japan Pro Wrestling]] and [[Pro Wrestling Noah]].&lt;ref name="PowerSlam109"/&gt; He also was the longest active member of the [[Nation of Domination]].

==Professional wrestling career==

===Early career (1994–1997)===
The name "D'Lo Brown" came as a reference to Connor's high school friend Darren Lewis ("D. Lewis Lo", Connor called him), who died of cancer. Connor asked Lewis' mother if he could use the name as a tribute to her son.&lt;ref name="dloname"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pyroandballyhoo.com/the-swerve-podcast-d-lo-brown/|title=The Swerve (Ep. 9) Featuring Dlo Brown - 41 minute mark - Sept 17 2014|publisher=pyroandballyhoo.com|accessdate=2014-09-16|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140917162056/http://www.pyroandballyhoo.com/the-swerve-podcast-d-lo-brown/|archivedate=2014-09-17|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Connor began his wrestling career in [[New Jersey]] as "Ace the Animal". He then wrestled [[John Tenta|Earthquake]] in the [[World Wrestling Federation|WWF]] in 1994 under his given name as a [[Job (professional wrestling)#Jobbers|jobber]]. This led to his first widely known accomplishment in [[Smoky Mountain Wrestling]], as he became the head of security for [[The Gangstas]]. When the Gangstas left SMW in 1995, he signed a deal with the WWF and was sent to the [[Heartland Wrestling Association]] for more training while also continuing to make more appearances as a jobber on WWF television. D'Lo also spent most of 1996 wrestling in [[Puerto Rico]] for the [[World Wrestling Council]] .

===World Wrestling Federation/Entertainment (1997–2003)===
====Nation of Domination (1997&amp;ndash;1998)====
{{main|Nation of Domination}}
Connor made his official [[WWE|WWF]] debut in 1997 as a member of [[Ron Simmons|Faarooq]]'s [[Nation of Domination]] [[Heel (professional wrestling)|heel]] [[Glossary of professional wrestling terms#Stable|stable]], debuting as one of several non-descript people in suits that accompanied the group to the ring.  During this time, his most notable moment was when [[Ahmed Johnson]] slammed him onto the roof of a car during [[Shotgun Saturday Night]]. His first televised match as a member of the Nation was on the April 26, 1997 episode of [[Shotgun Saturday Night]], as he, [[Brian Adams (wrestler)|Crush]], and [[Savio Vega]] defeated [[Justin Credible|Aldo Montoya]], [[Steve Corino]], and [[Tracy Smothers|Freddie Joe Floyd]].  On May 26, 1997 he had his first match on [[Monday Night Raw]] (which was called Raw Is War at the time), defeating [[Hardcore Holly|Bob "The Spark Plugg" Holly]]. After the [[King of the Ring 1997]], Faarooq fired the rest of the Nation's members, except for D-Lo, who was later joined by [[Ahmed Johnson]] (later replaced by [[Dwayne Johnson|Rocky Maivia]]), [[Charles Wright (wrestler)|Kama Mustafa]], and [[Mark Henry]]. In early 1998, the group [[Glossary of professional wrestling terms#Turn|turned]] on Faarooq, allowing Maivia, now going by the name "The Rock", to assume leadership. During this period Kama also changed his name to "The Godfather" and began portraying a pimp character. D'Lo and Henry eventually turned on both Rock and Godfather separately, moving into a feud with the Rock before finally branching out as a moderately successful [[tag team]], later turning [[Face (professional wrestling)|face]] along the way. Prior to the face turn, Brown had started wrestling with a chest protector, supposedly for a torn [[pectoralis major muscle|pectoral muscle]] sustained in a match against [[Dan Severn|Dan "The Beast" Severn]]. Instead, he used the chest protector to his advantage, making his finishing move, the ''[[Professional wrestling aerial techniques#Frog splash|Lo Down]]'', more effective.&lt;ref&gt;http://prowrestling.net/article.php?D-Lo-Brown-on-his-relationship-with-Droz-why-he-wore-a-chest-protector-failed-gimmicks-and-the-end-of-his-WWE-run-42054&lt;/ref&gt;

====Title pursuit (1998&amp;ndash;1999)====
In 1998, he feuded with [[X-Pac]] over the [[WWF European Championship]]. His career peaked when he held the [[WWE European Championship|European]] and [[WWE Intercontinental Championship|Intercontinental]] Championships simultaneously during a feud with [[Jeff Jarrett]] and Mark Henry. This feat has only been duplicated by [[Jeff Jarrett]], [[Kurt Angle]], and [[Rob Van Dam]], all of whom became [[Professional wrestling championship#World championships|world champions]] in some form, later in their careers.

[[File:D'Lo Brown in Birmingham.jpg|thumb|left|Brown in the late 1990s.]]
Brown was involved in inadvertently ending the career of [[Darren Drozdov|Droz]] on October 5, 1999 when a [[Powerbomb#Sitout powerbomb|running powerbomb]] was [[Botch (professional wrestling)|botched]] due to Droz' baggy shirt. The match was filmed for the October 7 edition of ''[[WWE Friday Night SmackDown|SmackDown!]]'', but was never aired. Droz suffered a severe neck injury, rendering him a [[Quadriplegia|quadriplegic]].&lt;ref name="PowerSlam109"&gt;{{cite news|title=Life after WWE|pages=32–35|work=Power Slam Magazine|id=109|date=August 2003|publisher=SW Publishing LTD|location=[[Lancaster, Lancashire]], [[England]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;  During an interview with Title Match Wrestling, D'Lo Brown dispelled a popular rumor that a fan had thrown an object into the ring which caused him to slip and badly injure Darren Drozdov. D'Lo took responsibility for botching the move, stating that the accident could have happened to "any" wrestler he had been in the ring with that night.  He also said the accident caused him to "wrestle differently" and to second guess every move he performed in the ring from that day forward.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KtJoY8wle8Q&lt;/ref&gt; Drozdov has maintained that he does not blame Brown for his injuries and he believes that the incident was an accident.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Ross|first1=Jim|title=WWE's Darren Drozdov thrives 15 years after being paralyzed during match|url=http://www.foxsports.com/buzzer/story/wwe-s-darren-drozdov-thrives-15-years-after-being-paralyzed-during-match-121614|website=Fox Sports|accessdate=5 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the rest of the year and into some of the next, Brown became an ally of former fellow Nation member The Godfather, emulating his dress and walking motions. The teaming ended when Brown turned heel on the Godfather.&lt;ref name="PowerSlam109"/&gt;

====Lo Down (2000&amp;ndash;2001)====
Brown then formed a tag team in July 2000 with [[Mosh (wrestler)|Chaz]] named ''Lo Down''. The team mostly wrestled on ''[[WWE Heat|Sunday Night Heat]]'' and ''[[WWE Jakked / Metal]]''. Shortly after the team formed, [[Tiger Ali Singh]] joined the team to become their [[Manager (professional wrestling)|manager]]. The tag team then came dressed towards the ring in [[Sikh]] attire and took on a [[Glossary of professional wrestling terms#Gimmick|gimmick]] very similar to Tiger's.&lt;ref name="PowerSlam109"/&gt; The team was removed from WWF [[television|TV]] in January 2001 after Singh was injured.&lt;ref name="swervepodcast"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pyroandballyhoo.com/vip-video-shoot-interview-wdlo-brown-091614/|title=VIP Video Shoot Interview w/ Dlo Brown (1 hour mark)|publisher=pyroandballyhoo.com|accessdate=2014-09-17|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140918032911/http://www.pyroandballyhoo.com/vip-video-shoot-interview-wdlo-brown-091614/|archivedate=2014-09-18|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Brown, it was the lowest point in his career. Chaz and Singh were later released by WWE while Brown stayed in WWE's [[Professional wrestling#Farm team|developmental territory]], OVW. Notably, Brown wrestled future World champion [[Dave Batista|Batista]] in a losing effort. Brown also spent six months in Puerto Rico wrestling for the [[International Wrestling Association (Puerto Rico)|International Wrestling Association]] teaming with Glamour Boy Shane holding the IWA tag team titles.&lt;ref name="swervepodcast"/&gt;

====Alliance with Theodore Long (2002&amp;ndash;2003)====
Brown returned to TV on the April 28, 2002 episode of ''Heat'', losing to [[Eddie Guerrero]]. For the rest of the year, Brown mostly wrestled on ''Heat'', did a little bit of commentary on the show, and even started a brief feud with [[Raven (wrestler)|Raven]]. In late 2002, [[Theodore Long]] retired as a WWE [[Referee (professional wrestling)|referee]] and managed D'Lo, who had complained about acts of [[racism]] during his matches. D'Lo started Long's group Thuggin' and Buggin' Enterprises which eventually turned into a group of African Americans who worked an angle in which they felt they were victims of racism and were being held down by the "white man." With Long's managerial services, D'Lo Brown went undefeated for several weeks.&lt;ref name="PowerSlam109"/&gt;

Brown faced [[Booker Huffman|Booker T]] in a losing effort on the February 10, 2003 episode of ''[[WWE Raw|Raw]]''. His involvement with Thuggin' and Buggin' Enterprises was brought to a close when footage was shown on the February 16 episode of ''Heat'' of Theodore Long kicking D'Lo Brown to the curb and introducing his replacement [[Rodney Begnaud|Rodney Mack]].&lt;ref name="PowerSlam109"/&gt; He was then released from his WWE contract on February 14, 2003.&lt;ref name="PowerSlam109"/&gt;

===Total Nonstop Action Wrestling (2003–2004)===
Connor, still under the D'Lo Brown name, Joined [[Total Nonstop Action Wrestling]] in March 2003. During his time in [[TNA Wrestling|NWA TNA]] he teamed with [[AJ Styles]] on many occasions together even challenging for the NWA World Tag Team Championships but were unsuccessful. After the team split up Brown challenged Styles for the [[NWA World Heavyweight Championship]] but came up short on every occasion doing a best of 3 series.

On the March 19, 2003 edition of NWA-TNA, Brown teamed with [[Dusty Rhodes (wrestler)|Dusty Rhodes]] and [[Jeff Jarrett]] defeating [[Erik Watts]], [[Brian Lawler]] and [[David Flair]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cagematch.net/?id=1&amp;nr=1410|title=NWA TNA #37 results}}&lt;/ref&gt; On April 2, 2003, edition of NWA-TNA weekly pay-per view D'Lo Brown unsuccessfully challenged Jeff Jarrett for the [[NWA World Heavyweight Championship]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.onlineworldofwrestling.com/results/tna/030402.html|title=April 2, 2003 - NWA TNA results}}&lt;/ref&gt; On April 14, 2004, Brown and [[Gran Apolo]] won the [[NWA World Tag Team Championship]]s defeating [[Kid Kash]] and [[Lance Archer|Dallas]], They lost the titles just seven days after winning them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.onlineworldofwrestling.com/results/tna/040414.html|title=April 14, 2004 - NWA TNA results}}&lt;/ref&gt; D'Lo later left TNA in the summer of 2004.

On a September 2014 interview, Brown said there was a time in TNA during this time where the creative team wanted to radically change his character; on top of not feeling like he was a good fit with TNA, Brown felt that by wrestling in Japan, he could still wrestle there while being D'Lo Brown.&lt;ref name="swervepodcast"/&gt;

===All Japan Pro Wrestling and overseas (2005–2007)===
Brown Joined [[All Japan Pro Wrestling]], competing in regular tours with the Japanese company as a member of [[Roughly Obsess and Destroy]] (RO&amp;D).&lt;ref name="PowerSlam109"/&gt; During one of these tours on September 17, 2006, Brown betrayed RO&amp;D to join the rival [[Voodoo Murders]] faction. Brown left All Japan in 2007 and rejoined [[Roughly Obsess and Destroy|RO&amp;D]] in [[Pro Wrestling Noah]].

When not in Japan, Brown was regularly found touring the [[United Kingdom]], as well as working for [[Irish Whip Wrestling]] in [[Ireland]]. In April 2005, Brown became one of the lead trainers of the ill-fated ''[[Celebrity Wrestling]]'' on [[ITV (TV network)|ITV]].

After a few weeks the programme was to be cancelled, but was instead moved to Sunday mornings to finish its final episodes. During his time wrestling in [[England]], he would face off in a series of matches against his ''Celebrity Wrestling'' opposition's trainer, [[Joe Hitchen|Joe Legend]].

==Gameplay==
''Donald Trump's Real Estate Tycoon'' is a single-player video game. The player's goal is to beat [[Donald Trump]] by becoming the most influential [[business magnate]].&lt;ref name=AG/&gt; In the Windows version, the player must choose the best real estate location in one of five cities: [[Los Angeles]], [[New York City]], [[Atlantic City]], [[London]] and [[Paris]].&lt;ref name=AG/&gt; The mobile version consists of only one city.&lt;ref name=GS/&gt; Each city is viewed from an [[Isometric graphics in video games and pixel art|isometric]] perspective.&lt;ref name=IGNAug&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ign.com/articles/2004/08/28/donald-trumps-real-estate-tycoon|title=Donald Trump's Real Estate Tycoon|date=August 27, 2004|work=IGN|access-date=June 28, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Each of the five cities contain an office, which opens at 6:00 AM and closes at 10:00 PM. Because of this, the player will sometimes have to focus on other cities or wait.

The game features four different types of real estate: commercial, hotel, office, and residential.&lt;ref name=Sep7/&gt; Each type of real estate comes in three different building sizes: small, medium, and large.&lt;ref name=Sep7&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gamespot.com/articles/donald-trumps-real-estate-tycoon-hands-on/1100-6106361/|title=Donald Trump's Real Estate Tycoon Hands-On|last=Palley|first=Stephen|date=September 7, 2004|work=GameSpot|access-date=June 28, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Trump checks on the player's progress every six months in the game. If Trump is impressed with the player's progress, he will promote the player up an additional floor in his headquarters.&lt;ref name=Sep7/&gt; The player's goal is to reach Trump on the top floor.&lt;ref name=Sep7/&gt; Trump also offers advice and hints to the player throughout the game.&lt;ref name=IGNAug/&gt;

A player may choose and purchase a piece of real estate. The price varies on its size or how long the game progresses. After the land is purchased, a building can be constructed on it.

Before construction, the style, quality, number of floors (up to 12) and building duration are to be selected. The better the quality of the building and the slower the construction time, the higher the cost. Each floor of the building can be made into three types of rooms: shops, offices or condos.&lt;ref name=Nov7/&gt; Shops are the most expensive to build but can be marketed at a higher price. Offices generate rather small profits but are cheaper to construct.

Once a building is complete, the player can market the rooms in one of two ways: selling or leasing. Through selling, a complete payment is achieved instantly. In leasing, payments are received on a monthly basis.

When short on budget, the player can borrow money from any of four banks. Loans are paid back automatically after an assigned number of months (the money the player has in hand will have some deduction for this matter). Therefore, sufficient amounts of profit have to be earned after borrowing.

A building's quality deteriorates over time.&lt;ref name=Sep7/&gt; When reusing them for commercial purpose, it is best to have them renovated. Through renovation, certain rooms can be changed into others. A change in the building's style and number of floors can only be achieved through demolition and reconstruction.

===Challenging Trump===
If the five city levels are passed, the player then faces a business competition with Trump.&lt;ref name=AG/&gt; The object of the challenge is to go into business against Trump for a fixed number of years and then come out with higher profit, with the ultimate goal of driving him into bankruptcy. Unlike the previous missions, natural disasters and criminal activity occur which cause damage to property.{{citation needed|date=April 2016}} The mobile version also allows the player to overtake Trump in the business industry.&lt;ref name=Donaldgame/&gt;

==Reception==
Avery Score of [[GameSpot]] gave the N-Gage QD version a 7.2 out of 10. Score called the game's auction sequences "incredibly boring," and wrote that despite the game's "unique branding, it is – at heart – a typical tycoon game that doesn't depart in any way from the conventions of the genre. While the game could have benefited from more-varied gameplay and smarter rival artificial intelligence, ''Real Estate Tycoon''{{'}}s strong presentation makes it an offering worthy of notice by fans of business simulations." Score praised the game's graphics, and wrote that while the game does not feature "much of an audio component, what's there is decent. No background music accompanies the gameplay, sadly, but your biannual reviews by Mr. Trump feature a vocal clip from the man himself." Score concluded that while the game "doesn't have any major flaws, it does fail to provide a varied experience. [...] After you're promoted 99 times, the game is over, but it's likely most gamers will tire of the game before they reach this level, as there's only one city in the game, and only so much you can do there. Doing nothing but buying low and selling high can hold one's interest for only so long."&lt;ref name=GS/&gt;

==History==
Every year since 1979, ''Entrepreneur'' has published a list of its top 500 [[franchising|franchise]] companies based on a submission and review process.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|publisher=''Entrepreneur''|year=2013|title=About the Franchise 500®|url=http://www.entrepreneur.com/franchises/franchise500/about.html|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130410123902/http://www.entrepreneur.com/franchises/franchise500/about.html|archivedate=2013-04-10|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The magazine also published many other lists and awards.

In 1987, the magazine launched its website, Entrepreneur.com, which expanded to include features, contests and other publications and [[Spin-off product|spin-offs]].&lt;ref name="mediakit"&gt;{{cite web|title=Entrepreneur Media Kit. About us|year=2013|url=http://www.entrepreneur.com/mediakit/about|publisher=''Entrepreneur''|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130502124107/http://www.entrepreneur.com/mediakit/about|archivedate=2013-05-02|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; As of 2013, the website received more than 6 million unique visitors each month.&lt;ref name="future"&gt;{{cite press release|title=PRNewsire (2013, March 25) "Mimvi and Entrepreneur Media Join Forces to Launch App Developer Crowdfunding and Discovery Program, TrepLabs™|website=cnbc.com|url=https://www.cnbc.com/id/100587633}}{{dead link|date=May 2018 |bot=SheriffIsInTown |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Spin-offs==
''Entrepreneur'' publishes the ''Entrepreneur StartUps'' magazine, available through subscription and on newsstands.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.entrepreneur.com/magazine/startups|title=Entrepreneur Startups Magazine|author=|first=|date=|website=Entrepreneur|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150615191001/http://www.entrepreneur.com/magazine/startups/index.html|archivedate=15 June 2015|deadurl=no|accessdate=23 March 2018|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The magazine publishes a blog managed by a dedicated online staff.&lt;ref&gt;http://blog.entrepreneur.com {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100722094524/http://blog.entrepreneur.com/ |date=2010-07-22 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It is also published in digital editions through its [[mobile app]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.entrepreneur.com/page/217251 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2013-04-02 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130410084251/http://www.entrepreneur.com/page/217251 |archivedate=2013-04-10 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1999, the website YoungEntrepreneur.com was created as a spin-off of Entrepreneur.com. It is an online forum for young entrepreneurs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.youngentrepreneur.com/about-us/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2013-04-02 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130420113245/http://www.youngentrepreneur.com/about-us/ |archivedate=2013-04-20 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2010, ''Entrepreneur'' launched the website SecondAct.com, which is targeted towards an older audience. When launched, the site used advertising as its sole source of revenue.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Fell|first=Jason|date=January 1, 2010|title=Entrepreneur Magazine To Take on AARP with New Web Site|url=http://www.foliomag.com/2010/entrepreneur-magazine-take-aarp-new-web-site|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121120145455/http://www.foliomag.com/2010/entrepreneur-magazine-take-aarp-new-web-site|archivedate=November 20, 2012|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Entrepreneur'' also publishes books through its Entrepreneur Press division. The company has a backlist of over 200 titles on business and entrepreneurship.&lt;ref name="press"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.entrepreneur.com/entrepreneurpress/|title=Entrepreneur Press - Start, Run &amp; Grow Your Business|author=|date=|website=entrepreneur.com|accessdate=23 March 2018|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160316113811/http://www.entrepreneur.com/entrepreneurpress|archivedate=16 March 2016|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On April 2017, Reid Hoffman announced the launch of a new podcast called "[[Masters of Scale]]", hosted by Entrepreneur magazine. In each episode, Reid acts as the host, introducing a counterintuitive business theory and proving it out through the episode through a series of conversations with successful entrepreneurs. ''Masters of Scale'' is committed to a 50-50 gender balance. The official podcast launched on 5 May 2017 on the [[Entrepreneur Magazine]] website but is now hosted at mastersofscale.com. Episodes so far feature guests such as [[Mark Zuckerberg]], [[Brian Chesky]], [[Sheryl Sandberg]], [[Stewart Butterfield]], [[Diane Greene]], [[John Elkann]] and [[Nancy Lublin]].

==Controversies==
In 2006, unusual [[web traffic]] measurements led to allegations that Entrepreneur.com used [[Pop-up ad|pop-ups]] to artificially boost its number of readers.&lt;ref&gt;Edmonston, Peter. (December 11, 2006). "[https://www.nytimes.com/2006/12/11/technology/11push.html In Web Traffic Tallies, Intruders Can Say You Visited Them] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161228084054/http://www.nytimes.com/2006/12/11/technology/11push.html |date=2016-12-28 }}." ''The New York Times.''&lt;/ref&gt;

The company has been involved in many lawsuits regarding its [[trademark]] on the word 'entrepreneur', suing a wide variety of entities for using the word.&lt;ref&gt;Bryan Wassel (October 30, 2007). "[http://www.minonline.com/news/5484.html Entrepreneur Media Tangles again with Scott Smith--Another Chapter in a Long Relationship] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131207153942/http://www.minonline.com/news/5484.html |date=2013-12-07 }}". MIN online.&lt;/ref&gt; The trademark has generally attracted criticism for being on a commonly used word for which there is no substitute, and the aggressiveness with which it is applied has been noted as somewhat ironic; ''[[Business Week]]'' asked "why would the publisher of Entrepreneur magazine be bullying entrepreneurs?"&lt;ref&gt;Barrett, P. M. (2011, May 19). "[http://www.businessweek.com/magazine/content/11_22/b4230078121476.htm Entrepreneur, the magazine that sues entrepreneurs] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130331010614/http://www.businessweek.com/magazine/content/11_22/b4230078121476.htm |date=2013-03-31 }}."

In the [[United States]], an '''executive order''' is a [[presidential directive|directive]] issued by the [[President of the United States]] that manages operations of the [[Federal government of the United States|federal government]] and has the force of law.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine| title=What is an Executive Order?| volume=17| issue=1| date=Fall 2016| url=https://www.americanbar.org/publications/insights_on_law_andsociety/17/fall-2016/what-is-an-executive-order.html| magazine=Insights on Law and Society| publisher=American Bar Association| issn=1531–2461| accessdate=January 1, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The legal or constitutional basis for executive orders has multiple sources. [[Article Two of the United States Constitution]] gives the president broad executive and enforcement authority to use their discretion to determine how to enforce the law or to otherwise manage the resources and staff of the executive branch. The ability to make such orders is also based on express or implied [[Act of Congress|Acts of Congress]] that delegate to the President some degree of discretionary power ([[delegated legislation]]).&lt;ref name="1957print"&gt;John Contrubis, ''[[s:Executive Orders and Proclamations#1|Executive Orders and Proclamations]]'', CRS Report for Congress #95-722A, March 9, 1999, Pp. 1-2&lt;/ref&gt;

Like both legislative statutes and regulations promulgated by government agencies, executive orders are subject to [[judicial review]] and may be overturned if the orders lack support by statute or the Constitution.&lt;ref name="FAANFAAN2014"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Rebecca M.

As the head of state and head of government of the United States, as well as Commander-in-Chief of the United States Armed Forces, only the [[President of the United States]] can issue an executive order.

== Basis in the United States Constitution ==

The [[United States Constitution]] does not have a provision that explicitly permits the use of executive orders. The term ''executive power'' in [[Article Two of the United States Constitution|Article&amp;nbsp;II]], Section&amp;nbsp;1, [[Article Two of the United States Constitution#Clause 1: Executive Power|Clause&amp;nbsp;1]] of the Constitution is not entirely clear. The term is mentioned as direction to "take Care that the Laws be faithfully executed" and is part of Article&amp;nbsp;II, Section&amp;nbsp;3. The consequence of failing to comply could possibly be removal from office.&lt;ref name="CIPP/G2008"&gt;{{cite book|author=Richard D.

[[File:President Nixon signing Executive Order 11491, with labor leaders - NARA - 194659.tif|thumb|President Nixon signing an executive order, 1969]]

With the exception of [[William Henry Harrison]], all presidents, beginning with George Washington in 1789, have issued orders that in general terms can be described as executive orders. Initially, they took no set form. Consequently, such orders varied as to form and substance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book  |last=93rd Cong., 2nd sess. |title=Executive Orders in Times of War and National Emergency: Report of the Special Committee on National Emergencies and Delegated Emergency Powers, United States Senate |year=1974 |publisher=U.S. Govt. Print. Off |page=23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first executive order was issued by George Washington on June 8, 1789, addressed to the heads of the federal departments, instructing them "to impress me with a full, precise, and distinct general idea of the affairs of the United States" in their fields.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2014/aug/14/dibacco-the-first-president-had-a-pen-but-no-phone/|title=DiBACCO: George Washington had a pen, but no phone, for executive orders|last=DiBacco|first=Thomas V.|date=2014-08-14|work=|newspaper=The Washington Times|language=en-US|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160514023700/http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2014/aug/14/dibacco-the-first-president-had-a-pen-but-no-phone|archive-date=2016-05-14|dead-url=|access-date=2017-02-04|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the political scientist Brian R. Dirck, the most famous executive order was by President Abraham Lincoln when he issued the [[Emancipation Proclamation]] on January 1, 1863. Dirck states:

{{quote|The Emancipation Proclamation was an executive order, itself a rather unusual thing in those days. Executive orders are simply presidential directives issued to agents of the executive department by its boss.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Brian R. Dirck|title=The Executive Branch of Federal Government: People, Process, and Politics|url={{google books |plainurl=y |id=wjSieiqLHzoC|page=102}}|year=2007|publisher=ABC-CLIO|page=102}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Until the early 1900s, executive orders went mostly unannounced and undocumented and seen only by the agencies to which they were directed. That changed when the [[United States Department of State|Department of State]] instituted a [[numbering scheme]] in 1907, starting retroactively with United States Executive Order 1 issued on October 20, 1862, by President [[Abraham Lincoln]].&lt;ref name=PEO&gt;Lord, Clifford et al.  ''[https://archive.org/stream/PresidentialExecutiveOrdersV1#page/n17/mode/1up Presidential Executive Orders]'', p. 1 (Archives Publishing Company, 1944).&lt;/ref&gt; The documents that later came to be known as "executive orders" apparently gained their name from this order issued by Lincoln, which was captioned "Executive Order Establishing a Provisional Court in Louisiana".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://fas.org/sgp/crs/misc/98-611.pdf#page=4|first=Harold C.|last=Relyea|work=[[Congressional Research Service]]|date=26 November 2008|id=Order Code 98-611 GOV|title=Presidential Directives: Background and Overview|page=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This court functioned during the military occupation of [[Louisiana]] during the [[American Civil War]], and Lincoln also used Executive Order 1 to appoint Charles A. Peabody as judge, and to designate the salaries of the court's officers.&lt;ref name=PEO /&gt;

President Truman's Executive Order 10340  in ''[[Youngstown Sheet &amp; Tube Co. v. Sawyer]]'', 343 US 579 (1952) placed all [[steel mill]]s in the country under federal control. This was found invalid because it attempted to make law, rather than clarify or act to further a law put forth by the Congress or the Constitution. Presidents since this decision have generally been careful to cite which specific laws they are acting under when issuing new executive orders. Likewise, when presidents believe their authority for issuing an executive order stems from within the powers outlined in the Constitution, the order will simply proclaim "under the authority vested in me by the Constitution" instead.

Wars have been fought upon executive order, including the 1999 [[Kosovo War]] during [[Bill Clinton]]'s second term in office. However, all such wars have had authorizing resolutions from Congress. The extent to which the president may exercise military power independently of Congress and the scope of the [[War Powers Resolution]] remain unresolved constitutional issues, although all presidents since its passage have complied with the terms of the resolution while maintaining that they are not constitutionally required to do so.

President Truman issued 907 executive orders, with 1,081 orders by Theodore Roosevelt, 1,203 orders by Calvin Coolidge, and 1,803 orders by Woodrow Wilson. Franklin D. Roosevelt has the distinction of making a record 3,522 executive orders.

=== Franklin Roosevelt ===
Prior to 1932, uncontested executive orders had determined such issues as national mourning on the death of a president, and the lowering of flags to half-staff. President [[Franklin Roosevelt]] issued the first of his 3,522 executive orders on March 6, 1933, declaring a [[bank holiday]], forbidding banks to release [[gold coin]] or [[bullion]]. [[Executive Order 6102]] forbade the hoarding of gold coin, bullion and [[gold certificate]]s. A further executive order required all newly mined domestic gold be delivered to the Treasury.&lt;ref name=peters/&gt;

By Executive Order 6581, the president created the [[Export-Import Bank of the United States]]. On March 7, 1934, he established the National Recovery Review Board (Executive Order 6632). On June 29, the president issued Executive Order 6763 "under the authority vested in me by the Constitution", thereby creating the [[National Labor Relations Board]].

In 1934, while [[Charles Evans Hughes]] was [[Chief Justice of the United States]] (in the time period known as the [[Hughes Court]]), the Court found that the [[National Industrial Recovery Act]] (NIRA) was unconstitutional. The president then issued Executive Order 7073 "by virtue of the authority vested in me under the said [[Emergency Relief Appropriation Act of 1935]]", reestablishing the [[National Emergency Council]] to administer the functions of the NIRA in carrying out the provisions of the Emergency Relief Appropriations Act. On June 15, he issued Executive Order 7075, which terminated NIRA and replaced it with the Office of Administration of the [[National Recovery Administration]].&lt;ref&gt;American Presidency Project, [http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/index.php?pid=15081 Executive Order 7075] (5/29/2009).&lt;/ref&gt;

In the years that followed, President Roosevelt replaced the outgoing judges with those more in line with his views, ultimately appointing [[Hugo Black]], [[Stanley Forman Reed|Stanley Reed]], [[Felix Frankfurter]], [[William O. Douglas]], [[Frank Murphy]], [[Robert H. Jackson]]  and [[James F. Byrnes]] to the Court. Historically, only [[George Washington]] had equal or greater influence over Supreme Court appointments, choosing all of its original members. Justices Frankfurter, Douglas, Black, and Jackson dramatically checked presidential power by invalidating the executive order at issue in [[Youngstown Sheet &amp; Tube Co. v. Sawyer|''The Steel Seizure Case'']] (i.e., [[s:Executive Order 10340|Executive Order 10340]]). In that case Roosevelt's successor, [[President Truman]], had ordered private steel production facilities seized in support of the Korean War effort, but the Court held the executive order was not within the power granted to the President by the Constitution.

== Reaction ==

Large policy changes with wide-ranging effects have been implemented through executive order, including the [[racial integration]] of the [[Military of the United States|armed forces]] under [[Harry S. Truman|Harry Truman]] and the [[desegregation]] of public schools under [[Dwight D. Eisenhower]].{{Citation needed|reason=these sound a bit dubious to me - and I cannot cross check it with e.g. [[School integration in the United States]]|date=February 2017}}

Two extreme examples of an executive order are Franklin Roosevelt's [[Executive Order 6102]] "forbidding the hoarding of gold coin, gold bullion, and gold certificates within the continental United States" and [[Executive Order 9066]], which delegated military authority to remove any or all people in a military zone (used to target [[Japanese American|Japanese-American]]s and [[German American|German-American]]s in certain regions). The order was then delegated to [[General (United States)|General]] [[John L. DeWitt]], and subsequently paved the way for all Japanese-Americans on the [[West Coast of the United States|West Coast]] to be sent to [[Internment|internment camps]] for the duration of [[World War II|World War&amp;nbsp;II]].

President [[George W. Bush]] issued [[Executive Order 13233]] in 2001, which restricted public access to the papers of former presidents. The order was criticized by the [[Society of American Archivists]] and other groups, who stated that it "violates both the spirit and letter of existing U.S. law on access to presidential papers as clearly laid down in 44 [[United States Code|USC]] 2201–07", and adding that the order "potentially threatens to undermine one of the very foundations of our nation". President [[Barack Obama]] revoked Executive Order 13233 in January 2009.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.whitehouse.gov/the_press_office/ExecutiveOrderPresidentialRecords/|title=Executive Order 13489 of January 21, 2009 — Presidential Records|accessdate=2009-01-22}}, ''[[Federal Register]]'' publication page and date: {{USFR|74|4669}}, January 26, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[The Heritage Foundation]] has accused presidents of abusing executive orders by using them to make laws without Congressional approval and moving existing laws away from their original mandates.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

=== Legal conflicts ===

In 1935, the Supreme Court overturned five of President Franklin Roosevelt's executive orders (6199, 6204, 6256, 6284, 6855). [[s:Executive Order 12954|Executive Order 12954]], issued by President [[Bill Clinton]] in 1995, attempted to prevent the federal government from contracting with organizations that had [[Strikebreaker|strike-breakers]] on the payroll; a federal appeals court subsequently ruled that the order conflicted with the [[National Labor Relations Act]], and invalidated the order.&lt;ref&gt;Catherine Edwards, "Emergency Rule, Abuse of Power?" ''Insight on the News'', August 23, 1999, Pg. 18&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=''Chamber of Commerce of the United States'', et al, v. Reich, 74 F.3d 1322 (D.C. Cir. 1996)|url=https://law.resource.org/pub/us/case/reporter/F3/074/74.F3d.1322.95-5242.html|publisher=Public.Resource.org|accessdate=7 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Congress has the power to overturn an executive order by passing legislation that invalidates it. Congress can also refuse to provide funding necessary to carry out certain policy measures contained with the order or to legitimize policy mechanisms. In the case of the former, the president retains the power to veto such a decision; however, the Congress may override a veto with a two-thirds majority to end an executive order. It has been argued that a congressional override of an executive order is a nearly impossible event, due to the [[supermajority]] vote required and the fact that such a vote leaves individual lawmakers vulnerable to political criticism.&lt;ref&gt;[[Harold Hongju Koh]], ''The National Security Constitution: Sharing Power after the Iran-Contra Affair'', 1990, pg. 118–19&lt;/ref&gt;

On July 30, 2014, the Republican-led House of Representatives approved a resolution authorizing [[Speaker of the United States House of Representatives|Speaker of the House]] [[John Boehner]] to sue President [[Barack Obama]] over claims that he exceeded his executive authority in changing a key provision of the [[Affordable Care Act]] ("Obamacare") on his own&lt;ref&gt;Deirdre Walsh, [http://www.cnn.com/2014/07/30/politics/gop-obama-lawsuit/index.html?hpt=hp_t2 "GOP-led House authorizes lawsuit against Obama"]. ''CNN.com'', July 30, 2014&lt;/ref&gt; and over what Republicans claimed had been "inadequate enforcement of the health care law", which Republican lawmakers opposed. In particular, Republicans "objected that the [[Presidency of Barack Obama|Obama administration]] delayed some parts of the law, particularly the mandate on employers who do not provide health care coverage".&lt;ref&gt;Michael McAuliff and Sam Levine, [http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2014/07/30/boehner-obama-lawsuit_n_5635416.html "House Authorizes Lawsuit Against President Obama"] ''Huff Post: Politics'', July 30, 2014,&lt;/ref&gt; The suit was filed in the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia on November 21, 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2014/11/22/us/politics/obamacare-lawsuit-filed-by-republicans.html|title=House G.O.P.

== State governor executive orders ==

Executive orders issued by state [[governor (United States)|governors]] are not the same as statutes passed by state legislatures, but do have the force of law in a similar way to the federal system. State executive orders are usually based on existing constitutional or statutory powers of the governor and do not require any action by the state legislature to take effect&lt;ref name= https://www.colorado.gov/governor/executive-orders&gt;{{citation | title= About Executive Orders of the State of Colorado | url= https://www.colorado.gov/governor/executive-orders}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name= https://gov.georgia.gov/executive-orders&gt;{{citation | title= About Executive Orders of the State of Georgia | url= https://gov.georgia.gov/executive-orders}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name= https://www.governor.wa.gov/office-governor/official-actions/executive-orders&gt;{{citation | title= About Executive Orders of the State of Washington | url= https://www.governor.wa.gov/office-governor/official-actions/executive-orders}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name= https://www.flgov.com/all-executive-orders&gt;{{citation | title= About Executive Orders of the State of Florida | url= https://www.flgov.com/all-executive-orders}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name= https://rules.utah.gov/executive-documents&gt;{{citation | title= About Executive Orders of the State of Utah | url= https://rules.utah.gov/executive-documents}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Executive orders may, for example, demand budget cuts from [[state governments of the United States|state government]] when the [[state legislature (United States)|state legislature]] is not in session, and economic conditions take a [[recession|downturn]], thereby decreasing tax revenue below what was forecast when the budget was approved.  Depending on the [[State constitution (United States)|state constitution]], a governor may specify what percentage each [[government agency]] must reduce by, and may exempt those that are already particularly underfunded, or cannot put long-term expenses (such as [[capital expenditure]]s) off until a later [[fiscal year]]. The governor may also call the legislature into [[special session]].

There are also other uses for gubernatorial executive orders. In 2007, for example, [[Sonny Perdue|George "Sonny" Perdue]], governor of Georgia, issued an executive order for all of [[Government of Georgia (U.S. state)|its state agencies]] to reduce water use during a major [[drought]]. This was also demanded of [[list of counties in Georgia|its counties]]' water systems, but it is unclear whether the order would have the force of law.

== Presidential proclamation ==
{{Main article|Presidential proclamation}}

According to political expert Phillip J. Cooper, a presidential proclamation "states a condition, declares a law and requires obedience, recognizes an event or triggers the implementation of a law (by recognizing that the circumstances in law have been realized)."&lt;ref&gt;Phillip J. Cooper. 2002. ''By Order of The President''. University of Kansas Press. Page 116.&lt;/ref&gt; Presidents define situations or conditions on situations that become legal or economic truth. These orders carry the same force of law as executive orders—the difference between the two is that executive orders are aimed at those inside government while proclamations are aimed at those outside government.

The administrative weight of these proclamations is upheld because they are often specifically authorized by congressional statute, making them "delegated unilateral powers." Presidential proclamations are often dismissed as a practical presidential tool for policy making because of the perception of proclamations as largely ceremonial or symbolic in nature. However, the legal weight of presidential proclamations suggests their importance to presidential governance.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20160225055023/http://www.polsci.uh.edu:80/database/aboutproc.asp Presidential Proclamations Project], University of Houston, Political Science Dept.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Finance Watch''' is a European non-governmental organization that conducts research and advocacy on [[financial regulation]].  Based in [[Brussels]], the organization focuses on financial regulation in the [[European Union]] and its member states.

Finance Watch was founded in 2011 by members of the [[European Parliament]] as a counterbalance to the financial lobby.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.presseurop.eu/en/content/article/1542771-finance-watch-lobby-break-lobbies "Finance Watch – a lobby to break the lobbies"]. [[Der Tagesspiegel]] (English translation). 23 February 2012. Retrieved 1 March 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; Its mission is "to strengthen the voice of society in the reform of financial regulation by conducting advocacy and presenting public interest arguments to lawmakers and the public as a counterweight to the private interest lobbying of the financial industry".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.world-governance.org/spip.php?site124/ "Finance Watch"]. Listing on FnWG. Retrieved 1 March 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==

Finance Watch was founded on 30 June 2011 as a consequence of a petition initiated in June 2010 by 22 &lt;ref&gt;[http://finance-watch.org/press/press-releases/344-signatories/ "Signatories"]. Finance Watch website. Retrieved 7 March 2013&lt;/ref&gt; members of the European Parliament, including members of all major political groups ([[Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe (European Parliament group)|ALDE]], [[European People's Party (European Parliament group)|EPP]], [[Greens-EFA]], [[GUE/NGL]], and [[S&amp;D]]). This call for action was signed by another 140 elected officials from across Europe, and led to an exploratory project funded by the initiators, which in turn resulted in the founding General Assembly on 30 June 2011. [[Ieke van den Burg]], a former [[Member of the European Parliament|MEP]], was appointed Chair of the Board of Directors and Thierry Philipponnat, a former banker and [[Amnesty International]] executive in France, became the Secretary General. In January 2017, Benoît Lallemand became Secretary General.

==Activities==
The organization's research team analyses financial regulation and formulates policy recommendations. Its views are then communicated to policymakers by its advocacy team, who also cooperate with member organizations who share the same views, and to the wider public by its communication team. 
Examples of dossiers that Finance Watch deals with are capital requirements for banks (the [[Basel III]] agreement), banking structure (the [[Liikanen report|Liikanen Consultation]]), [[high-frequency trading]], food and resource speculation, and protection of retail investors. Finance Watch also organizes conferences about financial regulation issues, where different stakeholders of the financial sector interact in public.

==Structure and financing==
Finance Watch is an international association under Belgian law&lt;ref&gt;[http://finance-watch.org/about-us/ "About us"]. Finance Watch website. Retrieved 7 March 2013&lt;/ref&gt; ([[AISBL]]), and has two types of members: individuals and civil society organizations. The latter include [[Consumer protection|consumer groups]], [[trade unions]], [[housing associations]], [[Environmentalism|environmental NGOs]], [[International development|development NGOs]] and others. Each member has an equal vote at the organization’s general assembly.  To become a member, both individuals and civil society organizations need to prove to the organization’s Committee of Transparency and Independence that they are independent from the financial industry. Individual members also need to qualify for membership by showing they have relevant experience and expertise. The members convene at least once a year for a General Assembly. During the year, the General Assembly is represented by the Board of Directors. The Board comprises eight Directors including six elected by and from the General Assembly (four Member organisations and two individual Members) and two independent Directors (“external personalities”).

Members of the Finance Watch board of directors as of June 2017:&lt;ref&gt;[http://finance-watch.org/about-us/governance-and-funding "Governance and Funding"]. Finance Watch website. Retrieved 14 March 2018&lt;/ref&gt;
* Chair: Prof. Dr. Rainer Lenz (Professor for International Finance, [[:de:Fachhochschule Bielefeld|Fachhochschule Bielefeld]])
* Vice-chair: Morten Clausen, [[UNI Europa]]
* Fran Boait, [[Positive Money]]
* Grégoire Niaudet, [[Secours Catholique]]
* Rainer Geiger, Attorney-at-law
* Andrea Baranes, Fondazione Banca Etica

Board Directors from outside the Membership (“external personalities”):
* Marc Roche (author, financial journalist)
* Professor Eric De Keuleneer (professor of economic regulation and banking at the Solvay School of the Université Libre de Bruxelles)

The organization’s budget has as its main sources project funding from the [[European Union]] and grants from several charitable foundations: Adessium Foundation, Fondation pour le progrès de l’homme, [[:de:Friedrich-Ebert-Stiftung|Friedrich-Ebert-Stiftung]], Better Markets, Open Society Initiative for Europe, as well as individual donations and members’ fees and contributions.

==Principles==
The declared mission of Finance Watch is “to strengthen the voice of society in the reform of financial regulation by conducting advocacy and presenting public interest arguments to lawmakers and the public as a counterweight to the private interest lobbying of the financial industry”.

The organization states it follows six principles&lt;ref&gt;[http://finance-watch.org/about-us/ "About us"]. Finance Watch website. Retrieved 7 March 2013&lt;/ref&gt; in the pursuit of this mission:

# The role of the financial industry (allocating capital, managing risk and providing financial services) has strong public interest implications. 
# The primary role of finance is to allocate capital to productive use. 
# Finance must serve the real economy, not the inverse.
# Banks are legitimate in pursuing profits to ensure their sustainability, but profits should not harm public interest.
# Credit risk should not be transferred to society at large.
# The real economy needs to have access to capital and financial services, in a sustainable, equitable and transparent manner.

'''Genetically modified foods''' ('''GM foods'''), also known as '''genetically engineered foods''' ('''GE foods'''), or '''bioengineered foods''' are foods produced from [[organism]]s that have had changes introduced into their [[DNA]] using the methods of [[genetic engineering]]. Genetic engineering techniques allow for the introduction of new traits as well as greater control over traits when compared to previous methods, such as [[selective breeding]] and [[mutation breeding]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bis.gov.uk/files/file15655.pdf GM Science Review First Report] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131016100707/http://www.bis.gov.uk/files/file15655.pdf |date=October 16, 2013}}, Prepared by the UK GM Science Review panel (July 2003).

The most widely planted GMOs are designed to tolerate herbicides. By 2006 some weed populations had evolved to tolerate some of the same herbicides. [[Palmer amaranth]] is a weed that competes with cotton. A native of the southwestern US, it traveled east and was first found resistant to glyphosate in 2006, less than 10 years after GM cotton was introduced.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Culpepper, Stanley A |title=Glyphosate-resistant Palmer amaranth (Amaranthus palmeri) confirmed in Georgia. |volume=54 |issue=4 |pages=620–26 |year=2006 |journal=Weed Science |doi=10.1614/ws-06-001r.1 |display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Gallant, Andre |title=Pigweed in the Cotton: A superweed invades Georgia |journal=Modern Farmer}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Webster, TM |last2=Grey, TL |title=Glyphosate-Resistant Palmer Amaranth (Amaranthus palmeri) Morphology, Growth, and Seed Production in Georgia. |volume=63 |issue=1 |pages=264–72 |year=2015 |journal=Weed Science |doi=10.1614/ws-d-14-00051.1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Process==
{{Main|Genetic engineering}}
Genetically engineered organisms are generated and tested in the laboratory for desired qualities. The most common modification is to add one or more [[gene]]s to an organism's [[genome]]. Less commonly, genes are removed or their expression is increased or [[Gene silencing|silenced]] or the number of copies of a gene is increased or decreased.

Once satisfactory strains are produced, the producer applies for [[Regulation of the release of genetic modified organisms|regulatory approval to field-test]] them, called a "field release". Field-testing involves cultivating the plants on farm fields or growing animals in a controlled environment. If these field tests are successful, the producer applies for regulatory approval to grow and market the crop. Once approved, specimens (seeds, cuttings, breeding pairs, etc.) are cultivated and sold to farmers. The farmers cultivate and market the new strain. In some cases, the approval covers marketing but not cultivation.

According to the [[USDA]], the number of field releases for genetically engineered organisms has grown from four in 1985 to an average of about 800 per year. Cumulatively, more than 17,000 releases had been approved through September 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Fernandez-Cornejo J, Wechsler S, Livingston M, Mitchell L | title=Genetically engineered crops in the United States | journal=Economic Research Service | date=February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2013, the USDA approved the import of a GM pineapple that is pink in color and that "overexpresses" a gene derived from [[tangerine]]s and suppress other genes, increasing production of [[lycopene]]. The plant's flowering cycle was changed to provide for more uniform growth and quality. The fruit "does not have the ability to propagate and persist in the environment once they have been harvested", according to USDA APHIS. According to Del Monte's submission, the pineapples are commercially grown in a "monoculture" that prevents seed production, as the plant's flowers aren't exposed to compatible [[pollen]] sources. Importation into Hawaii is banned for "plant sanitation" reasons.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url= |title=Del Monte Gets Approval to Import GMO Pineapple |last=Perkowski |first=Mateisz |date=April 16, 2013 |publisher=Food Democracy Now}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Corn starch and starch sugars, including syrups===

[[Starch]] or amylum is a [[polysaccharide]] produced by all green plants as an energy store. Pure starch is a white, tasteless and odourless powder. It consists of two types of molecules: the linear and helical [[amylose]] and the branched [[amylopectin]]. Depending on the plant, starch generally contains 20 to 25% amylose and 75 to 80% amylopectin by weight.&lt;ref name=Jaffe /&gt;

Starch can be further modified to create [[modified starch]] for specific purposes,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.starch.dk/isi/starch/tm18www-corn.htm |title=International Starch: Production of corn starch |publisher=Starch.dk |accessdate=2011-06-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; including creation of many of the sugars in processed foods. They include:
* [[Maltodextrin]], a lightly hydrolyzed starch product used as a bland-tasting filler and thickener.
* Various [[glucose syrup]]s, also called [[corn syrup]]s in the US, viscous solutions used as sweeteners and thickeners in many kinds of processed foods.
* [[Dextrose]], commercial glucose, prepared by the complete hydrolysis of starch.
* [[High fructose syrup]], made by treating dextrose solutions with the enzyme [[glucose isomerase]], until a substantial fraction of the glucose has been converted to fructose.
* [[Sugar alcohol]]s, such as [[maltitol]], [[erythritol]], [[sorbitol]], [[mannitol]] and [[hydrogenated starch hydrolysate]], are sweeteners made by reducing sugars.

===Lecithin===
[[Lecithin]] is a naturally occurring [[lipid]]. It can be found in egg yolks and oil-producing plants. it is an emulsifier and thus is used in many foods.

===Sugar===
The US imports 10% of its sugar, while the remaining 90% is extracted from [[sugar beet]] and [[sugarcane]]. After deregulation in 2005, [[Genetically modified sugar beet|glyphosate-resistant sugar beet]] was extensively adopted in the United States. 95% of beet acres in the US were planted with glyphosate-resistant seed in 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.isaaa.org/resources/publications/briefs/43/executivesummary/default.asp |title=ISAAA Brief 43-2011.

The length of a fatty acid influences its fat absorption during the digestive process. Fatty acids in the middle position on the glycerol molecules appear to be absorbed more easily and influence metabolism more than fatty acids on the end positions. Unlike ordinary fats, MCTs are metabolized like carbohydrates. They have exceptional oxidative stability, and prevent foods from turning rancid readily.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite magazine |last=Beatrice |first=Trum Hunter |year=1999 |title=Modified Vegetable Oils |url= |magazine=Consumers' Research Magazine |volume=3 |pages=8–9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Other uses==
===Animal feed===
Livestock and poultry are raised on [[Compound feed|animal feed]], much of which is composed of the leftovers from processing crops, including GM crops. For example, approximately 43% of a canola seed is oil. What remains after oil extraction is a meal that becomes an ingredient in animal feed and contains canola protein.&lt;ref name="What Is Canola Oil?"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.canolainfo.org/canola/index.php |title=What is Canola Oil? |publisher=CanolaInfo |accessdate=2012-12-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; Likewise, the bulk of the soybean crop is grown for oil and meal. The high-protein defatted and toasted soy meal becomes livestock feed and [[dog food]]. 98% of the US soybean crop goes for livestock feed.&lt;ref&gt;David Bennett for Southeast Farm Press, February 5, 2003 [http://southeastfarmpress.com/mag/farming_world_soybean_consumption/index.html World soybean consumption quickens] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060605232122/http://southeastfarmpress.com/mag/farming_world_soybean_consumption/index.html |date=2006-06-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=britannica&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/557184/soybean |title=Soybean |publisher=Encyclopædia Britannica Online |accessdate=February 18, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2011, 49% of the US maize harvest was used for livestock feed (including the percentage of waste from [[distillers grains]]).&lt;ref name=NCGA&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ncga.com/uploads/useruploads/woc_2012.pdf |title=2012 World of Corn, National Corn Growers Association |format=PDF |accessdate=2012-12-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; "Despite methods that are becoming more and more sensitive, tests have not yet been able to establish a difference in the meat, milk, or eggs of animals depending on the type of feed they are fed. It is impossible to tell if an animal was fed GM soy just by looking at the resulting meat, dairy, or egg products. The only way to verify the presence of GMOs in animal feed is to analyze the origin of the feed itself."&lt;ref&gt;Staff, GMO Compass. December 7, 2006.

A 2012 literature review of studies evaluating the effect of GM feed on the health of animals did not find evidence that animals were adversely affected, although small biological differences were occasionally found. The studies included in the review ranged from 90 days to two years, with several of the longer studies considering reproductive and intergenerational effects.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Snell C |last2=Bernheim A |last3=Berge JB |last4=Kuntz M |last5=Pascal G |last6=paris A |last7=Ricroch AE |title=Assessment of the health impact of GM plant diets in long-term and multigenerational animal feeding trials: A literature review |volume=50 |issue=3–4 |pages=1134–48 |year=2012 |journal=Food and Chemical Toxicology |doi=10.1016/j.fct.2011.11.048 |pmid=22155268}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Enzyme]]s produced by genetically modified microorganisms are also integrated into animal feed to enhance availability of nutrients and overall digestion. These enzymes may also provide benefit to the gut [[microbiome]] of an animal, as well as [[Hydrolysis|hydrolyse]] [[Antinutrient|antinutritional factors]] present in the feed.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |title=Food Processing Technology: Principles and Practice |last=Fellows |first=P.J. |publisher=Woodhead Publishing Limited |year=2009 |isbn=978-1845692162 |location= |page=236}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Proteins===
[[Rennet]] is a mixture of enzymes used to coagulate milk into cheese. Originally it was available only from the fourth stomach of calves, and was scarce and expensive, or was available from microbial sources, which often produced unpleasant tastes. Genetic engineering made it possible to extract rennet-producing genes from animal stomachs and insert them into [[bacteria]], [[fungi]] or [[yeasts]] to make them produce [[chymosin]], the key enzyme.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |pmid=6304731 |year=1983 |last1=Emtage |first1=JS |last2=Angal |first2=S |last3=Doel |first3=MT |last4=Harris |first4=TJ |last5=Jenkins |first5=B |last6=Lilley |first6=G |last7=Lowe |first7=PA |title=Synthesis of calf prochymosin (prorennin) in ''Escherichia coli'' |volume=80 |issue=12 |pages=3671–75 |pmc=394112 |journal=Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America |doi=10.1073/pnas.80.12.3671|bibcode=1983PNAS...80.3671E}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Harris TJ, Lowe PA, Lyons A, Thomas PG, Eaton MA, Millican TA, Patel TP, Bose CC, Carey NH, Doel MT | title=Molecular cloning and nucleotide sequence of cDNA coding for calf preprochymosin | journal=Nucleic Acids Research | volume=10 | issue=7 | pages=2177–87 |date=April 1982 | pmid=6283469 | pmc=320601 | doi=10.1093/nar/10.7.2177}}&lt;/ref&gt; The modified microorganism is killed after fermentation.

In some countries, recombinant (GM) [[bovine somatotropin]] (also called rBST, or bovine growth hormone or BGH) is approved for administration to increase milk production. rBST may be present in milk from rBST treated cows, but it is destroyed in the digestive system and even if directly injected into the human bloodstream, has no observable effect on humans.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=Dale E. |last=Baumana |first2=Robert J |last2=Collier |date=September 15, 2010 |url=http://www.agribiotech.info/details/2010%20rBST%20article%20for%20NABC_Bauman%2009-15%20Final%2004.pdf |title=Use of Bovine Somatotropin in Dairy Production}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Staff |publisher=American Cancer Society |work=Last Medical Review |date=2011-02-18}}{{full citation needed|date=October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cancer.org/cancer/cancercauses/othercarcinogens/athome/recombinant-bovine-growth-hormone |title=Recombinant Bovine Growth Hormone}}&lt;/ref&gt; The FDA, [[World Health Organization]], [[American Medical Association]], [[Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics|American Dietetic Association]] and the [[National Institute of Health|National Institutes of Health]] have independently stated that dairy products and meat from rBST-treated cows are safe for human consumption.&lt;ref name="Brennand"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://extension.usu.edu/files/publications/factsheet/FN-250_6.pdf |title=Bovine Somatotropin in Milk |first=Charlotte P. |last=Brennand |accessdate=2011-03-06 }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, on 30 September 2010, the [[United States Court of Appeals, Sixth Circuit]], analyzing submitted evidence, found a "compositional difference" between milk from rBGH-treated cows and milk from untreated cows.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first=Greg |last=Cima |publisher=JAVMA News |date=November 18, 2010 |url=https://www.avma.org/News/JAVMANews/Pages/101201m.aspx |title=Appellate court gives mixed ruling on Ohio rBST labeling rules}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Ohio decision"&gt;{{cite web|author=leafcom |url=http://www.leagle.com/xmlResult.aspx?xmldoc=in%20fco%2020100930180.xml&amp;docbase=cslwar3-2007-curr |title=International Dairy Foods Ass'n v.

===Livestock===
{{Main|Genetically modified livestock}}

Genetically modified livestock are organisms from the group of cattle, sheep, pigs, goats, birds, horses and fish kept for human consumption, whose genetic material ([[DNA]]) has been altered using [[genetic engineering]] techniques. In some cases, the aim is to introduce a new [[trait (biology)|trait]] to the animals which does not occur naturally in the species, i.e. [[transgenesis]].

A 2003 review published on behalf of [[Food Standards Australia New Zealand]] examined transgenic experimentation on terrestrial livestock species as well as aquatic species such as fish and shellfish. The review examined the molecular techniques used for experimentation as well as techniques for tracing the [[transgenes]] in animals and products as well as issues regarding transgene stability.&lt;ref name="Harper2003"&gt;{{cite web |title=Global progress toward transgenic food animals: A survey of publicly available information. |url=http://www.foodstandards.gov.au/publications/documents/Transgenic%20Livestock%20Review%20CSIRO%20FINAL%2012Dec20031.pdf |year=2003 |author=Harper, G.S., Brownlee, A., Hall, T.E., Seymour, R., Lyons, R. and Ledwith, P. |publisher=Food Standards Australia and New Zealand |accessdate=August 27, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some mammals typically used for food production have been modified to produce non-food products, a practice sometimes called [[Pharming (genetics)|Pharming]].

=== Testing ===
The legal and regulatory status of GM foods varies by country, with some nations banning or restricting them, and others permitting them with widely differing degrees of regulation.&lt;ref name="loc.gov"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Bashshur"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Sifferlin"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Council on Foreign Relations"/&gt; Countries such as the United States, Canada, Lebanon and Egypt use ''[[substantial equivalence]]'' to determine if further testing is required, while many countries such as those in the European Union, Brazil and China only authorize GMO cultivation on a case-by-case basis. In the U.S. the FDA determined that GMO's are "[[Generally Recognized as Safe]]" (GRAS) and therefore do not require additional testing if the GMO product is substantially equivalent to the non-modified product.&lt;ref name=Marden&gt;Emily Marden, [http://lawdigitalcommons.bc.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=2236&amp;context=bclr Risk and Regulation: U.S. Regulatory Policy on Genetically Modified Food and Agriculture] 44 B.C.L. Rev. 733 (2003).&lt;/ref&gt; If new substances are found, further testing may be required to satisfy concerns over potential toxicity, allergenicity, possible gene transfer to humans or genetic outcrossing to other organisms.&lt;ref name="who-gmfaq" /&gt;

==Regulation==
{{See also|Regulation of genetic engineering}}
[[File:Genetically Engineered (GE) Food labeling laws map 2.png|thumb|Green: Mandatory labeling required; Red: Ban on import and cultivation of genetically engineered food.]]
Government regulation of GMO development and release varies widely between countries. Marked differences separate [[Genetic engineering in the United States#Regulation|GMO regulation in the U.S.]] and [[Regulation of genetically modified organisms in the European Union|GMO regulation in the European Union]].&lt;ref name="Council on Foreign Relations" /&gt; Regulation also varies depending on the intended product's use. For example, a crop not intended for food use is generally not reviewed by authorities responsible for food safety.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.potatopro.com/newsletters/20100310.htm |title=The History and Future of GM Potatoes |publisher=PotatoPro.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===United States regulations===
{{Main|Genetic engineering in the United States#Regulation}}
In the U.S., three government organizations regulate GMOs. The [[FDA]] checks the chemical composition of organisms for potential [[allergens]]. The [[United States Department of Agriculture]] (USDA) supervises field testing and monitors the distribution of GM seeds. The [[United States Environmental Protection Agency]] (EPA) is responsible for monitoring pesticide usage, including plants modified to contain proteins [[insecticide|toxic to insects]]. Like USDA, EPA also oversees field testing and the distribution of crops that have had contact with pesticides to ensure environmental safety.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.monsanto.com/newsviews/pages/food-safety.aspx#q3 |title=Commonly Asked Questions about the Food Safety of GMOs |author=APPDMZ\ccvivr |work=monsanto.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Better source|reason=needs more independent, neutral source|date=August 2015}} In 2015 the Obama administration announced that it would update the way the government regulated GM crops.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Andrew |last=Pollack |title=White House Orders Review of Rules for Genetically Modified Crops |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2015/07/03/business/white-house-orders-review-of-biotechnology-regulations.html |newspaper=The New York Times |date=2015-07-02 |accessdate=2015-07-03 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1992 FDA published "Statement of Policy: Foods derived from New Plant Varieties". This statement is a clarification of FDA's interpretation of the Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act with respect to foods produced from new plant varieties developed using [[Molecular cloning|recombinant deoxyribonucleic acid (rDNA) technology]]. FDA encouraged developers to consult with the FDA regarding any bioengineered foods in development. The FDA says developers routinely do reach out for consultations. In 1996 FDA updated consultation procedures.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.fda.gov/Food/FoodScienceResearch/GEPlants/default.htm |title=Food from Genetically Engineered Plants |publisher=FDA |accessdate=18 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.fda.gov/Food/GuidanceRegulation/GuidanceDocumentsRegulatoryInformation/Biotechnology/ucm096095.htm |title=Statement of Policy – Foods Derived from New Plant Varieties |accessdate=18 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The StarLink corn recalls occurred in the autumn of 2000, when over 300 food products were found to contain a [[genetically modified maize|genetically modified corn]] that had not been approved for human consumption.&lt;ref&gt;Andrew Pollack for ''The New York Times''. September 23, 2000 [https://www.nytimes.com/2000/09/23/business/kraft-recalls-taco-shells-with-bioengineered-corn.html "Kraft Recalls Taco Shells With Bioengineered Corn"]&lt;/ref&gt; It was the first-ever recall of a genetically modified food.

===Labeling===
As of 2015, 64 countries require labeling of GMO products in the marketplace.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |publisher=Center for Food Safety |url=http://www.centerforfoodsafety.org/issues/976/ge-food-labeling/international-labeling-laws |title=International Labeling Laws}}&lt;/ref&gt;

US and Canadian national policy is to require a label only given significant composition differences or documented health impacts, although some individual US states (Vermont, Connecticut and Maine) enacted laws requiring them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Chokshi |first1=Niraj |title=Vermont just passed the nation's first GMO food labeling law.

In some jurisdictions, the labeling requirement depends on the relative quantity of GMO in the product. A study that investigated voluntary labeling in South Africa found that 31% of products labeled as GMO-free had a GM content above 1.0%.&lt;ref name="Botha"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/j.foodchem.2008.06.050 |title=South Africa: A case study for voluntary GM labelling |year=2009 |last1=Botha |first1=Gerda M. |last2=Viljoen |first2=Christopher D. |journal=Food Chemistry |volume=112 |issue=4 |pages=1060–64}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the European Union all food (including [[processed food]]) or [[Compound feed|feed]] that contains greater than 0.9% GMOs must be labelled.&lt;ref name="Davison2010"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/j.plantsci.2009.12.005 |title=GM plants: Science, politics and EC regulations |year=2010 |last1=Davison |first1=John |journal=Plant Science |volume=178 |issue=2 |pages=94–98}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Detection===
{{Main|Detection of genetically modified organisms}}
Testing on GMOs in food and feed is routinely done using molecular techniques such as [[PCR]] and [[bioinformatics]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |publisher=European Commission Join Research Centre |url=https://ec.europa.eu/jrc/en/research-topic/gmos |title=EU GMO testing homepage |accessdate=May 31, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a January 2010 paper, the extraction and detection of DNA along a complete industrial soybean oil processing chain was described to monitor the presence of [[Roundup Ready]] (RR) soybean: "The amplification of soybean lectin gene by end-point polymerase chain reaction (PCR) was successfully achieved in all the steps of extraction and refining processes, until the fully refined soybean oil. The amplification of RR soybean by PCR assays using event-specific primers was also achieved for all the extraction and refining steps, except for the intermediate steps of refining (neutralisation, washing and bleaching) possibly due to sample instability. The real-time PCR assays using specific probes confirmed all the results and proved that it is possible to detect and quantify genetically modified organisms in the fully refined soybean oil. To our knowledge, this has never been reported before and represents an important accomplishment regarding the traceability of genetically modified organisms in refined oils."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Costa |first1=Joana |last2=Mafra |first2=Isabel |last3=Amaral |first3=Joana S. |last4=Oliveira |first4=M.B.P.P. |title=Monitoring genetically modified soybean along the industrial soybean oil extraction and refining processes by polymerase chain reaction techniques |journal=Food Research International |volume=43 |pages=301–06 |year=2010 |doi=10.1016/j.foodres.2009.10.003}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Thomas Redick, detection and prevention of cross-pollination is possible through the suggestions offered by the [[Farm Service Agency]] (FSA) and [[Natural Resources Conservation Service]] (NRCS). Suggestions include educating farmers on the importance of coexistence, providing farmers with tools and incentives to promote coexistence, conduct research to understand and monitor gene flow, provide assurance of quality and diversity in crops, provide compensation for actual economic losses for farmers.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.heinonline.org/HOL/Page?handle=hein.journals/dragl19&amp;div=6&amp;start_page=39&amp;collection=journals&amp;set_as_cursor=0&amp;men_tab=srchresults&lt;/ref&gt;

==Controversies==
{{Main|Genetically modified food controversies}}

The genetically modified foods controversy consists of a set of disputes over the use of food made from genetically modified crops. The disputes involve consumers, farmers, biotechnology companies, governmental regulators, non-governmental organizations, environmental and political activists and scientists. The major disagreements include whether GM foods can be safely consumed, harm the environment and/or are adequately tested and regulated.&lt;ref name="IDEA" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[American Medical Association]] (2012). [http://www.ama-assn.org/resources/doc/csaph/a12-csaph2-bioengineeredfoods.pdf Report 2 of the Council on Science and Public Health: Labeling of Bioengineered Foods.] "To better detect potential harms of bioengineered foods, the Council believes that pre-market safety assessment should shift from a voluntary notification process to a mandatory requirement." p. 7&lt;/ref&gt; The objectivity of scientific research and publications has been challenged.&lt;ref name="CAPE" /&gt; Farming-related disputes include the use and impact of pesticides, seed production and use, side effects on non-GMO crops/farms,&lt;ref name="CIEH"&gt;[[Chartered Institute of Environmental Health]] (2006) [http://www.cieh.org/uploadedFiles/Core/Policy/CIEH_consultation_responses/Response_GM_final.pdf Proposals for managing the coexistence of GM, conventional and organic crops Response to the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs consultation paper.] October 2006&lt;/ref&gt; and potential control of the GM food supply by seed companies.&lt;ref name="CAPE" /&gt;

The conflicts have continued since GM foods were invented. They have occupied the media, the courts,&lt;ref&gt;Paull, John (2013) [http://www.academia.edu/13681599/The_threat_of_genetically_modified_organisms_GMOs_to_organic_agriculture_A_case_study_update "The threat of genetically modified organisms (GMOs) to organic agriculture: A case study update"].

'''George Barbu Știrbei''' or '''Știrbeiŭ''', also known as '''Gheorghe''', '''Georgie''', or '''Iorgu Știrbei''' ([[Francization|Francized]] ''Georges Stirbey''; April 1, 1828 – August 15, 1925), was a [[Wallachia]]n-born [[Romania]]n aristocrat and politician who served as the [[Ministry of Foreign Affairs (Romania)|Minister of Foreign Affairs]] from July 15, 1866 until February 21, 1867. He was the eldest son of [[Barbu Dimitrie Știrbei]], [[List of rulers of Wallachia|Prince of Wallachia]], and the nephew of his rival, [[Gheorghe Bibescu]]; his younger siblings included the landowner and industrialist [[Alexandru B. Știrbei]]. Educated in France, he returned to Wallachia during his father's princely mandate, as a ''[[Begzada|Beizadea]]'' and aspiring politician. Fleeing his country during the [[Crimean War]], he served the [[Second French Empire|French Empire]] before returning home to become Wallachian Minister of War and ''[[Spatharios]]''. He is remembered for reforming the [[Wallachian military forces|Wallachian militia]] during the remainder of Prince Barbu's term.

Știrbei remained a legislator of Wallachia and then of the [[United Principalities]]. He was however strongly opposed to the Principalities' first ''[[Domnitor]]'', [[Alexandru Ioan Cuza]], reemerging by 1860 as a charismatic leader of the conservative opposition. His involvement in political scandals and electoral intrigues led to his brief arrest that same year, but Cuza was ultimately toppled in 1866. Following this, Știrbei abandoned his own bid for the throne to serve ''Domnitor'' [[Carol I of Romania|Carol of Hohenzollern]]. As Foreign Minister, he helped secure recognition for the United Principalities, and made diplomatic overtures toward [[Austria-Hungary]]. Failing in his attempt to become [[Prime Minister of Romania]], he was disappointed with the ''Domnitor'', leaving politics altogether.

Știrbei divided the second half of his life between homes in Paris and [[Bécon-les-Bruyères]], and was [[French nationality law|naturalized French]]. In this period, he was a collector and patron of the arts, noted as [[Jean-Baptiste Carpeaux]]'s last-ever sponsor. He was also married to the actress and sculptor [[Gustave Haller|Valérie Simonin]], adopting her daughters [[Consuelo Fould|Consuelo]] and [[Georges Achille Fould]]—whom he educated artistically. His parallel work was as a cultural journalist, and, late in his life, as the posthumous editor of [[Jean-Jacques Weiss]] and as a memoirist. His controversial dealings with Carpeaux, the status of his inheritance, and his paternity disputes remained at the center of public attention long after his death.

==Biography==
===Origins and early life===
Știrbei was born in [[Bucharest]], the Wallachian capital, on April 1, 1828, a date he himself gave against records which have 1834;&lt;ref&gt;Badea-Păun, p. 108&lt;/ref&gt; other sources claim 1832.&lt;ref name="la&amp;al500"&gt;Lucreția Angheluță, Salomeea Rotaru, Liana Miclescu, Marilena Apostolescu, Marina Vazaca, ''Bibliografia românească modernă (1831–1918). Vol. IV: R–Z'', p. 500. Bucharest: [[Editura științifică și enciclopedică]], 1996.  {{ISBN|973-27-0501-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Lăcusteanu &amp; Crutzescu, p. 240&lt;/ref&gt; His paternal origins were in the Bibescu family, which had its roots in the petty [[Boyars of Wallachia and Moldavia|boyar nobility]] of [[Oltenia]]: a yeoman Bibul, living before 1700, was the family patriarch.&lt;ref&gt;Iorga (1910), pp. 9–10&lt;/ref&gt; The clan went through a rapid social climb after the fall of the [[Phanariote]]s and the foundation of a ''[[Regulamentul Organic]]'' regime. As a protege of Prince [[Grigore IV Ghica]] in the 1820s, George's grandfather Dumitrachi married Ecaterina, a member of the [[Văcărescu family]], and made friends with her tutor, ''[[Vornic]]'' Barbu C. Știrbei. He was a godfather to Dumitrachi's first-born, Barbu Bibescu, whom he adopted, before dying in 1813; Barbu was therefore the only one known as Știrbei among the three Bibescu brothers.&lt;ref&gt;Iorga (1910), pp. 9–13. See also Hêrjeu, p. 162; Lăcusteanu &amp; Crutzescu, pp. 137–138, 258; Papazoglu &amp; Speteanu, pp. 182, 313&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="așboieri7"&gt;{{ro icon}} Alexandra Șerban, [https://web.archive.org/web/20170405140639/http://adevarul.ro/cultura/istorie/serial-boieri-mari-episodul-7-renascutneamul-Stirbey-propria-cenusa-barbu-Stirbey-mai-abil-om-umbra-regeluiferdinand-1_58b135e05ab6550cb8cb96a3/index.html "Serial.

When his son was born, Barbu Bibescu-Știrbei was merely a ''[[Clucer]]'', trailing behind his more ambitious brother Gheorghe;&lt;ref&gt;Iorga (1910), pp. 15–17&lt;/ref&gt; his climb was moreover interrupted by the [[Russian Empire]], with its [[Russo-Turkish War (1828–1829)|invasion of Wallachia]]. It resumed when he was imposed by Consul Peter I. Rikman into the cabinet of Prince [[Alexandru II Ghica]].&lt;ref&gt;Hêrjeu, p. 88&lt;/ref&gt; The liberal-minded and [[Westernization|Westernizing]] [[Pavel Kiselyov]] become governor of the two [[Danubian Principalities]], also forcing Știrbei's appointment to government offices.&lt;ref&gt;Iorga (1910), pp. 15–32&lt;/ref&gt; This service prompted the establishment to regard the Bibescu–Știrbeis as intolerable upstarts—or "Oltenian horse-breeders", in the reported sayings of [[Alecu Filipescu-Vulpea]].&lt;ref&gt;Lăcusteanu &amp; Crutzescu, pp. 137–138, 258&lt;/ref&gt; Other critics jokingly referred to the brothers as the "equine dynasty".&lt;ref&gt;Chirică, p. 357&lt;/ref&gt;

During those years, Barbu fathered six more children by Elisabeta: sons [[Alexandru B. Știrbei|Alexandru]] and Dimitrie, daughters Fenereta, Alina, Elisabeta, and Elena.&lt;ref&gt;Mucenic, p. 74&lt;/ref&gt; When George turned 12 in 1840, his father dispatched him to the [[July Monarchy|Kingdom of France]], where he enlisted at the Bollin school, then at [[Lycée Louis-le-Grand]]. During his time at Louis-le-Grand, young Știrbei met and befriended the future writer-politician [[Jean-Jacques Weiss]], becoming his admirer and, later, his biographer and editor.&lt;ref&gt;Badea-Păun, pp. 107–108&lt;/ref&gt; Taking his ''[[Baccalauréat]]'' in August 1847, he studied in parallel at the Administrative School, [[Collège de France]], and the [[Paris Law Faculty]]. His graduation from the latter came in August 1850, when he published with [[Firmin Didot]] his thesis ''De Condictione indebite ou Des obligations qui se forment sans contrat''.&lt;ref&gt;Badea-Păun, p. 108&lt;/ref&gt; He witnessed the [[French Revolution of 1848]], and in later years emphasized its positive qualities in disputes with the more conservative politicians.&lt;ref&gt;Catargiu, pp. 268–269&lt;/ref&gt; This period of Știrbei's life also overlapped with a [[Wallachian Revolution of 1848|Wallachian Revolution]], which toppled his uncle Bibescu from the throne. Having conceded the [[Wallachian princely election, 1842|1842 election]] to his brother,&lt;ref&gt;Hêrjeu, pp. 99–100; Iorga, ''Istoria'', pp. 38–39, 67; Lăcusteanu &amp; Crutzescu, p. 141; Papazoglu &amp; Speteanu, pp. 169–170&lt;/ref&gt; Barbu Știrbei accepted government office, but maintained his independence. He had been sidelined by the time of the revolt, keeping silent during its outbreak.&lt;ref&gt;Iorga (1910), pp. 31–32, 50; Papazoglu &amp; Speteanu, p. 178&lt;/ref&gt; However, as noted by his son, he privately resented it as an experiment in socialism.&lt;ref&gt;Chiper, pp. 199, 205–206&lt;/ref&gt;

Following interventions by Russia and the [[Ottoman Empire]], Barbu Știrbei was made Prince and George became the ''[[Begzada|Beizadea]]''. Returning to Bucharest, he was incorporated as a Major into the [[Wallachian military forces]] and joined the Prince on official duties, including on his 1851 visit to [[Telega, Prahova|Telega]]; he was dispatched on official trips to [[Saint Petersburg]], [[Sibiu|Hermannstadt]], and [[Istanbul]].&lt;ref&gt;Iorga (1910), pp. 95–96, 133–134, 149–150, 164, 175, 191. See also Filitti, p. 70&lt;/ref&gt; Noted as a "great lover of theater and invaluable supporter of the actors", "especially fond" of the comedian [[Costache Caragiale]], he was present with his father for the inauguration of Caragiale's [[National Theatre Bucharest|Bucharest Theater]] (late 1852).&lt;ref&gt;N. Săvulescu, "Costache Caragiale", in ''[[Revista Fundațiilor Regale]]'', Nr. 2/1939, p. 378&lt;/ref&gt; In 1853 he joined his father's government as ''[[Logothete]]'' of the Justice Ministry.&lt;ref&gt;Badea-Păun, p. 108&lt;/ref&gt; The cabinet also included [[Alexandru Plagino]], who was brothers-in-law with the ''Beizadea''; later, his brothers-in-law included [[Ion Emanuel Florescu]].&lt;ref&gt;Lăcusteanu &amp; Crutzescu, pp. 74, 215, 241, 282; Maciu, p. 62; Iorga (1910), pp. 36, 49–50, 53, 82, 158, 166–167; Mucenic, p. 74&lt;/ref&gt; Of his sisters, Elena, married count Leo Larisch von Mönnich from [[Cieszyn Silesia]];&lt;ref&gt;Filitti, pp. 70, 72–74; Iorga (1910), p. 158; Mucenic, p. 74&lt;/ref&gt; in 1855, she gave birth to his son [[Count Georg Larisch of Moennich, Baron of Ellgoth and Karwin|Georg]], later husband of [[Countess Marie Larisch von Moennich|the Baroness Wallersee]].&lt;ref&gt;Veronika Matroszová, ''Rod Larisch-Mönnichů na Karvinsku'', pp. 10–11.

===War Minister===
A new Russian intervention came in summer 1853, during the escalation ahead of the [[Crimean War]]. At the time, ''Beizadea'' George was a Colonel attached to the General Staff.&lt;ref&gt;Luminița Gavra, "Restituiri. Statul major princiar al oștirii (1830–1865)", in ''Document. Buletinul Arhivelor Militare'', Nr. 1/2010, pp. 27–28&lt;/ref&gt; Alongside his father, he paid homage to [[Mikhail Dmitrievich Gorchakov]], an effective surrender.&lt;ref&gt;Iorga (1910), p. 152&lt;/ref&gt; He was eventually chased out of the country by the unfolding events (as were his younger brothers),&lt;ref&gt;"On lit dans le ''Wanderer'', de Vienne", in ''[[La Presse (French newspaper)|La Presse]]'', December 3, 1853, p. 2&lt;/ref&gt; and returned to Paris, where he applied for service in the [[French Army]]. Attached as a foreigner,&lt;ref name="necrLT"&gt;"Nécrologie" in ''[[Le Temps (Paris)|Le Temps]]'', August 15, 1925, p. 4&lt;/ref&gt; he was stationed with the [[Versailles]] cavalry, and became [[Pierre Chrétien Korte]]'s ''[[aide de camp]]''. He spent the war negotiating with the [[Second French Empire]] and the Ottomans on behalf of his father, carefully balancing the interests of both powers.&lt;ref&gt;Badea-Păun, pp. 108–109&lt;/ref&gt; 

Russia's defeat restored his father to the throne, allowing Știrbei to be decommissioned and to return home; Wallachia and Moldavia had by then been placed under international supervision, ending ''Regulamentul Organic''. The new tutelage of the country involved not only the Ottomans and the Russians, but also France, the [[Austrian Empire]], [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland|Great Britain]], the [[Kingdom of Prussia]], and [[Kingdom of Sardinia|Piedmont-Sardinia]]. From Bucharest, George Știrbei left on new diplomatic tours, visiting Moldavia and approaching its [[List of rulers of Moldavia|Prince]], [[Grigore Alexandru Ghica]]; he also had contacts with Austria through [[Johann Baptist Coronini-Cronberg|Count Coronini]]. He presented the latter with a paper, ''Resumé de la situation administrative de Valachie'', which became useful for the Western powers in evaluating the course of Wallachian affairs.&lt;ref&gt;Badea-Păun, p. 109&lt;/ref&gt; 

''Beizadea'' Știrbei was eventually sent to France with orders to complete his military education there.&lt;ref&gt;Badea-Păun, p. 109; Iorga (1910), p. 179&lt;/ref&gt; He is known to have taken courses at both the [[Prussian Military Academy]] and the [[École spéciale militaire de Saint-Cyr|Military School of Saint-Cyr]], following which he became a Wallachian general and Minister of War (''[[Spatharios]]'').&lt;ref&gt;Lăcusteanu &amp; Crutzescu, p. 240&lt;/ref&gt; This position allowed him influence over the political and social life. His art collection probably dates back to this period, when painter [[Theodor Aman]], whom the Știrbeis elevated to the rank of ''[[Pitar (rank)|Pitar]]'', sent him one of his canvasses as thanks.&lt;ref&gt;Badea-Păun, p. 112&lt;/ref&gt; Possibly pressed on by the Moldavian precedent, from December 1855 the ''Beizadea'' and fellow minister Plagino also recommended to Prince Barbu that he liberate Wallachia's [[Slavery in Romania|Romani slaves]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Gheorghe Sion]], ''Suvenire contimporane'', p. 53.

As noted by his subordinate [[Dimitrie Papazoglu]], his reformist stance "won him affection from the entire army."&lt;ref&gt;Lăcusteanu &amp; Crutzescu, p. 240; Papazoglu &amp; Speteanu, pp. 178–179&lt;/ref&gt; His work also included teaching history to cadets enlisted at Wallachia's Military School.&lt;ref&gt;Lăcusteanu &amp; Crutzescu, pp. 73–75&lt;/ref&gt; In 1855, he traveled to [[Czernowitz]], where he paid homage to [[Emperor of Austria|Emperor]] [[Franz Joseph I of Austria|Franz Joseph]].&lt;ref&gt;Filitti, p. 70&lt;/ref&gt; At the time, the ''Beizadea'' approached France's [[Ministry of Foreign Affairs and International Development (France)|Minister of Foreign Affairs]], [[Édouard Drouyn de Lhuys]], asking him to provide training for Wallachian militias in the event of war with the Ottomans;&lt;ref&gt;Badea-Păun, p. 109&lt;/ref&gt; he also obtained the recall of a hostile consul, Eugène Poujade.&lt;ref&gt;Iorga (1910), p. 183&lt;/ref&gt; 

Through his son, Prince Barbu also communicated his plans for establishing the "[[United Principalities]]" of Wallachia, Moldavia, and the [[Budjak]], with perpetual neutrality and full independence, to guard the [[mouths of the Danube]] against Russian encroachment. These plans also provided for the election to the unified throne of a foreign prince, unconnected to the boyardom.&lt;ref&gt;Iorga (1910), pp. 179–181&lt;/ref&gt; Attending the [[Congress of Paris (1856)|Paris Peace Conference]], the ''Beizadea'' resigned himself to the discovery that his father's mandate would not be renewed, and from that point on demanded that a foreign dynasty be placed on Wallachia's throne.&lt;ref&gt;Badea-Păun, p. 109&lt;/ref&gt; The Știrbeis also began lobbying for the construction of a railway from [[Brașov|Kronstadt]] to [[Oltenița]]. If built, it would have been Wallachia's first.&lt;ref&gt;Filitti, p. 79&lt;/ref&gt; 

Appointed ''[[Kaymakam|Caimacam]]'' in July 1856, [[Alexandru II Ghica]] immediately ordered State Secretary Plagino and ''Spatharios'' Știrbei to be stripped of their offices, and announced a formal investigation of the deposed regime, which caused an uproar among the Știrbeists.&lt;ref&gt;Maciu, p. 62&lt;/ref&gt; Unpopular with the boyars, and faced with their passive resistance, Ghica sought to reconcile with the moderate wing of the [[National Party (Romania)|National Party]], a loose group which advocated union.&lt;ref&gt;Maciu, p. 64&lt;/ref&gt; After this period of uncertainty, his father won a seat as deputy to the [[ad-hoc Divan]] in the [[Wallachian legislative election, 1857|September 1857 race]]. Both father and son took a reserved stance on the unionist issue, favoring good relations with the Ottoman Empire, which did not approve of the National Party.&lt;ref&gt;Iorga (1910), pp. 90–92&lt;/ref&gt; Following Ghica's demotion and the reshuffle of 1858, the Știrbeis controlled one of the three new ''Caimacami'', [[Ioan Manu]].&lt;ref&gt;Chirică, pp. 352–353, 357&lt;/ref&gt;

===Conservative leadership=== 
The Știrbeist project was damaged by the [[Wallachian Elective Assembly, 1859|election of January 1859]], in which both Bibescu brothers stood as candidates in [[Dolj County]].&lt;ref&gt;Gherghe, pp. 128–130, 161, 173–174; Hêrjeu, pp. 199–200; Lăcusteanu &amp; Crutzescu, pp. 239–240&lt;/ref&gt; The ''Beizadea'' also ran at Dolj's landowners college, in what was reported as a dirty race, complete with "machinations and base intrigues."&lt;ref&gt;Gherghe, pp. 173–174&lt;/ref&gt; As reported by ''[[Steaua Dunării|Steoa Dunărei]]'', he also took a seat in [[Romanați County]].&lt;ref&gt;Chirică, p. 356&lt;/ref&gt; A set of circumstances, utilized to its advantage by the National Party, resulted in the election to the throne of a Moldavian, [[Alexandru Ioan Cuza]], as ''[[Domnitor]]'' of both countries—now officially the "United Principalities". His father's ambition of reaching the same result from a more conservative basis was frustrated on January 23, when his own candidacy for the throne was rejected by the deputies.&lt;ref&gt;Chirică, pp. 357–359; Iorga, ''Istoria'', pp. 339–342&lt;/ref&gt;

After his confirmation to the newly-formed Legislative Assembly, ''Beizadea'' Știrbei stood on the its hard right: he and Florescu proposed an illiberal press law, drawing protests from their fellow deputy, the journalist [[Cezar Bolliac]].&lt;ref&gt;Vasile Novac, "Activitatea politică a argeşenilor și mușcelenilor reflectată în paginile ziarului ''Românul'' în perioada august 1857 – iunie 1859", in ''Argessis. Studii și Comunicări, Seria Istorie'', Vol. X, 2001, p. 247&lt;/ref&gt; A wider conflict soon erupted between the Cuzas and the Știrbeis. Already in July 1859, while seemingly vacationing at [[Le Mont-Dore (France)|Mont-Dore-les-Bains]], ''Beizadea'' Știrbei attacked Cuza in a protest paper addressed to the foreign powers, alleging that the new regime equated anarchy.&lt;ref&gt;Badea-Păun, p. 109. See also Iorga (1910), p. 192&lt;/ref&gt; The consolidated opposition, headed by [[Barbu Catargiu]] and [[Constantin N. Brăiloiu]], wanted him to lead their Conservative Committee, but Știrbei dropped out and Plagino was considered instead.&lt;ref&gt;Vlad, pp. 4–5&lt;/ref&gt; During that legislature, he and Catargiu, who served as the [[Ministry of Public Finance (Romania)|Minister of Finance]], had extensive disagreements over budgetary matters and economic policies.&lt;ref&gt;Catargiu, pp. 93–95, 109–110, 155&lt;/ref&gt; However, according to a note in the ''[[Gazzetta Ufficiale]]'', he was the "natural leader" of a "conservative party, comprising for the most supporters of the former princes Stirbey and Bibesco {{sic}}".&lt;ref&gt;"Parte non ufficiale. Principati Riuniti", in ''[[Gazzetta Ufficiale]]'', No. 68/1860, p. 3&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, historian [[Nicolae Iorga]] describes the conservative faction as a "party of the pretenders", uniting George Barbu with Bibescu's heirs.&lt;ref&gt;Iorga, ''Istoria'', p. 371&lt;/ref&gt;

Eventually, Știrbei joined the Assembly in the [[Wallachian legislative election, 1860|1860 election]], taking the majority vote at [[Craiova]]. This race was also mired in controversy, after the authorities alleged that he had bribed the electorate.&lt;ref&gt;Catargiu, pp. 183–186&lt;/ref&gt; In March, he joined the committee which was to present Cuza with the Assembly's stances, but he resigned over disagreements with his colleagues.&lt;ref&gt;Catargiu, pp. 171–172&lt;/ref&gt; During the ramified scandal, his alleged direct threats against Cuza resulted in his arrest.&lt;ref name="LDisCorE"&gt;"Correo estanjero", in ''La Discusión. Diário Democrático'', April 4, 1860, p. 3&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Badea-Păun, p. 109; Catargiu, pp. 183–186; Iorga (1910), p. 192&lt;/ref&gt; He was charged with high treason and, reportedly, "Romanians [felt] passionate about the prisoner, asking that he stand trial."&lt;ref name="LDisCorE"/&gt; The breach of his [[parliamentary immunity]] degenerated into a national embarrassment, prompting the collective resignation of [[Ion Ghica]]'s Wallachian cabinet.&lt;ref&gt;Iorga (1910), p. 192&lt;/ref&gt; He retook his seat in the [[Wallachian legislative election, 1861|1861 race]]. This came shortly after violent riots in Craiova, which, Știrbei argued, called for a parliamentary inquiry.&lt;ref&gt;Catargiu, pp. 212–215&lt;/ref&gt; Carried by an anti-Cuza majority opposed in particular to [[Land reform in Romania|land reform]], this legislature elected him Vice President, seconding Catargiu.&lt;ref&gt;Catargiu, pp. 213, 237; Hêrjeu, p. 205&lt;/ref&gt; According to various sources, he was also the President of that body.&lt;ref name="la&amp;al500"/&gt;&lt;ref name="necrLT"/&gt;

An Ottoman diplomat, [[Gregory Aristarchis|Aristarchi Bey]], recounted in June 1861 that "the prince Stirbey" and other "leading boyars" were fostering "agitation in favor of a foreign prince"; this move, he suspected, had Russian backing.&lt;ref&gt;[[Barbara Jelavich]], "The Ottoman Empire, the Great Powers and the Legislative and Administrative Union of the Principalities", in [[Keith Hitchins]] (ed.), ''Romanian Studies. Vol. 2, 1971—1972'', p. 69. Leiden: [[Brill Publishers]], 1973.  {{ISBN|90-04-03639-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; Together, Știrbei, Alexandru C. Moruzi and [[Manolache Costache Epureanu]] pushed the Assembly into a deadlock, filibustering over Cuza's attempt to introduce a [[copyhold]] (''embatic''), set aside for landless peasants and supplied from the [[Secularization of monastic estates in Romania|monastery land reserve]].&lt;ref&gt;L. Botezan, "Problema agrara în dezbaterile parlamentare din Romînia în anul 1862", in ''Studia Universitatis Babeș-Bolyai. Historia'', Vol. IV, Issue 1, 1961, pp. 133–134&lt;/ref&gt; During those moths, he drew close to the conservative club formed by [[Apostol Arsache]], maintaining only loose contacts with the Catargiu faction—they differed on foreign policy issues, with Știrbei favoring an anti-Ottoman stance that Catargiu thought excessive.&lt;ref&gt;Vlad, pp. 7–8, 13&lt;/ref&gt; In July, Știrbei and Catargiu, who was by then the [[Prime Minister of Romania]], reviewed with alarm a meeting of the [[Liberalism and radicalism in Romania|left-wing liberals]] on Filaret Hill, which had demanded increased political representation.&lt;ref&gt;Catargiu, pp. 266–271; Chiper, p. 202&lt;/ref&gt; Știrbei was described as a covert reactionary by the liberal doyen, [[C. A. Rosetti]], but he protested against the label; a polemic ensued.&lt;ref&gt;[[C. A. Rosetti]], "Domnuluĭ Georgie Știrbeĭ. Arhon Spătar", in ''[[Românul|Românulŭ]]'', October 8, 1861, pp. 891–892&lt;/ref&gt;

Nevertheless, over the following months, Știrbei sponsored Rosetti's daily newspaper ''[[Românul]]'', which began advocating for Bibescu to replace Cuza.&lt;ref&gt;V. Mihordea, "Recenzii. Vasile Netea, ''C. A. Rosetti''", in ''Studii. Revistă de Istorie'', Nr. 5/1971, p. 1064&lt;/ref&gt; In June 1862, jointly with Rosetti and [[Ion Brătianu]], he stepped down from the Assembly to protest Cuza's policies.&lt;ref&gt;"Donaufürstenthümer", in ''[[Laibacher Zeitung]]'', No. 140/1862, p. 559&lt;/ref&gt; Over the autumn months, he toured European capitals to obtain support for the conservative projects.&lt;ref&gt;Iorga, ''Istoria'', p. 375&lt;/ref&gt; In January of the following year, with conservatives recovering ground after Catargiu's assassination and other setbacks,&lt;ref&gt;Hêrjeu, pp. 210–221; Ungureanu, pp. 501–502&lt;/ref&gt; Știrbei signed his name to a letter of protest against Cuza's authoritarianism.&lt;ref&gt;Badea-Păun, p. 110&lt;/ref&gt; In April, he publicized his [[tax resistance]] and litigation with the authorities of [[Piața Amzei|Amzei suburb]], Bucharest.&lt;ref&gt;"Revista politica. Domnuluĭ împlinitoriŭ alŭ comuniĭ (suburbiea) Amd̦a", in ''[[Românul|Românulŭ]]'', April 14, 1863, p. 1&lt;/ref&gt; 

Știrbei was subsequently a noted player in the "monstrous coalition", grouping left-liberals and "White" conservatives against Cuza and his centrist government.&lt;ref&gt;Tanoviceanu, pp. 14–15; Ungureanu, p. 501&lt;/ref&gt; In September, he and D. Ghica were star defenders at Rosetti's own trial for sedition. Appearing alongside Brătianu and [[Anastasie Panu]], Știrbei now spoke about press freedom as being vital for civic education.&lt;ref&gt;"Curți și tribunalurĭ. Curtea Apelativă Criminale. Audința de la 10 Septemvrie", in ''[[Românul|Romănulŭ]]'', September 14, 1863, pp. 1–4&lt;/ref&gt; With Cuza taking more radical positions on land reform, Știrbei also revised his stance. Alongside a bipartisan committee (comprising Rosetti, Brătianu, Panu, Ion Ghica, [[Anton I. Arion]], [[Grigore Arghiropol]] and [[Nicolae Golescu]]), he now supported the sale of state land to the landless.&lt;ref&gt;"Liberalii și țĕranii", in ''[[Voința Națională]]'', March 22 (April 3), 1892, p. 1&lt;/ref&gt;

===Under Carol===
In January 1863, Știrbei signed his name to a letter of protest which openly defied Cuza's agenda.&lt;ref&gt;Tanoviceanu, p. 14&lt;/ref&gt; Cuza's response to the resistance was an effective coup in May 1864. Eventually, he was himself toppled by the "monstrous coalition" in early 1866—a secretive palace coup in which Știrbei allegedly had a prominent role.&lt;ref name="lică"&gt;Lică, "Diplomația d. ministru de esterne", in ''[[Ghimpele]]'', Nr. 9/1866, pp. 34–35&lt;/ref&gt; Following the [[Romanian general election, April 1866|election of April 1866]], Știrbei was sent to the unified [[Chamber of Deputies of Romania|Assembly of Deputies]], which was debating the [[1866 Constitution of Romania|new Constitution]]. In that context, he adopted a [[Classical liberalism|classical liberal]] stance, explaining that both his party and the liberals could agree on the restoration of "true freedom".&lt;ref&gt;[[Nicolae Filipescu]], "Conservatism și liberalism", in ''[[Epoca (Romania)|Epoca]]'', March 15 (27), 1886, p. 1&lt;/ref&gt; 

Despite reintroducing such pluralism, the regime change had left uncertain the continuation of Moldo–Wallachian federalism. In that context, Știrbei became one of the Romanian diplomats tasked with obtaining an international settlement recognizing continued union under a foreign ''Domnitor''. However, as reported by his supervisor [[Ion Bălăceanu]], Știrbei also tried to promote his own bid for the throne, which was received with ridicule.&lt;ref&gt;{{ro icon}} Mihai Sorin Rădulescu, [https://web.archive.org/web/20120804110334/http://www.romlit.ro/ghislain_de_diesbach_despre_anul_1866 "Ghislain de Diesbach despre anul 1866"], in ''[[România Literară]]'', Nr. 45/2006&lt;/ref&gt; His father also entertained the notion that either George or one of his brothers would be selected.&lt;ref&gt;Iorga (1910), p. 193&lt;/ref&gt; Eventually, Știrbei recognized the results of the [[Romanian prince referendum, 1866|April plebiscite]] and communicated to the Prussian prince [[Carol I of Romania|Carol of Hohenzollern]], that Romanians wanted him as their ''Domnitor''. In September, his father, who was living his final years in [[Nice]], made a show of his loyalty by visiting Carol in Bucharest, pledging his and his sons' "industrious and faithful" support.&lt;ref&gt;Badea-Păun, p. 110. See also Iorga (1910), pp. 193–194&lt;/ref&gt;

From July 15, Știrbei had joined Ghica's national cabinet as [[Ministry of Foreign Affairs (Romania)|Minister of Foreign Affairs]], endeavoring to ensure Ottoman recognition for a continued union under Carol. He and the ''Domnitor'' went to Istanbul for the ''[[firman]]'', which was granted to them by [[Abdülaziz]]. Carol signaled his refusal of direct vassalage by making Știrbei read the document, which signaled to Abdülaziz that he considered himself an equal.&lt;ref&gt;Badea-Păun, pp. 110–111. See also Iorga, ''Correspondance'', p. viii&lt;/ref&gt; Știrbei also took some of the first steps in bringing Romania closer to [[Austria-Hungary]], which remained a staple of the conservative approach to foreign politics. He began talks with the [[Friedrich Ferdinand von Beust|Count von Beust]] regarding the exchange of consuls, [[extradition]] procedures, and connecting [[Rail transport in Romania|Romania's railway grid]] with the [[Imperial Royal Privileged Austrian State Railway Company|StEG]].&lt;ref&gt;Iorga, ''Correspondance'', pp. ix–x; Lucia Tafta, "Relațiile economice româno-franceze: aranjamentul comercial din noiembrie 1876", in ''Muzeul Național'', Vol. XII, 2000, p. 124&lt;/ref&gt; The ''Beizadea'' joined the 60-man conservative caucus in the Assembly, and, after the [[Romanian general election, November 1866|election of November 1866]], was recognized as a factional leader, alongside a fellow ''Beizadea'', [[Dimitrie Ghica]].&lt;ref&gt;Dan Moroianu, "Dezbateri parlamentare și patimi politice între 1866–1867", in ''Buridava'', Vol. VI, 2008, p. 135&lt;/ref&gt; The political realignment made him an adversary of the liberal camp. Its magazine, ''[[Ghimpele]]'', claimed that Știrbei was a comical man, "stuffed on princely might and pride", whose activity as minister amounted to "continuously advising the empires" on how to handle Romania.&lt;ref name="lică"/&gt;

Știrbei was reconfirmed as deputy for Dolj and Craiova in the [[Romanian general election, 1867|December 1867 election]], this time without controversy.&lt;ref&gt;"Romania", in ''Albina'', Nr. 7/1868, p. 2&lt;/ref&gt; The ''Domnitor'', who found him to be a competent diplomat, also considered him for his Prime Minister. The latter proposal, endorsed by the French, was vetoed by [[Karl Anton, Prince of Hohenzollern|Karl Anton of Hohenzollern]], who feared that Știrbei had not renounced his bid for the throne.&lt;ref&gt;Badea-Păun, p. 111&lt;/ref&gt; Reportedly, this greatly disappointed the candidate, contributing to his decision to quit politics and the country altogether&lt;ref&gt;Badea-Păun, p. 111&lt;/ref&gt;—although, according to other accounts, he cited reasons of health.&lt;ref&gt;P. Boutet, "Nouvelles diplomatiques et internationales", in ''Le Mémorial Diplomatique'', No. 18/1870, p. 205&lt;/ref&gt; As noted in 1880 by a friend, the art historian [[Ernest Chesneau]], Știrbei sensed a need for "independence".&lt;ref&gt;Chesneau, p. 212&lt;/ref&gt; 

Știrbei was residing in Nice by February 1868, when he attended a gala for the [[European Squadron]], alongside [[Alfred Le Roux]], [[Ludwig II of Bavaria]], and [[Robert I, Duke of Parma|the Duke of Parma]].&lt;ref&gt;"Epitome of News. Banquet", in ''[[County Observer and Monmouthshire Central Advertiser]]'', February 8, 1868, p. 6&lt;/ref&gt; He still resented the liberals' approach to foreign policy, and, late in 1868, traveled to [[Pest, Hungary|Pest]], [[Lands of the Crown of Saint Stephen|Hungary]], where he was received by the [[Prime Minister of Hungary|Minister-President]], [[Gyula Andrássy]]. Știrbei claimed that the liberals would allow Romania to be invaded by Russia, with Andrássy assuring him that Austria-Hungary would respond militarily, without herself annexing the former Principalities.&lt;ref&gt;André Lorant, ''Le compromis austro-hongrois et l'opinion publique française en 1867'', pp. 183–184.

===Bécon withdrawal===
From 1869, ''Beizadea'' George based himself in Paris, purchasing an apartment on [[Boulevard Haussmann]],&lt;ref&gt;Badea-Păun, pp. 111&lt;/ref&gt; and, in 1871, also an [[Empire style|Empire-style]] ''[[château]]'' in [[Bécon-les-Bruyères]]. The latter had been a temporary home by [[Adolphe Thiers]], and then an [[Orsini family|Orsini]] residence; heavily damaged by the [[Paris Commune]], it was restored and enlarged by its new owner.&lt;ref name="smméta"&gt;{{fr icon}} Mylène Sultan, [http://www.lexpress.fr/informations/les-metamorphoses-de-deux-jumelles_725831.html "Les métamorphoses de deux jumelles"], in ''[[L'Express]]'', December 4, 2008&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Badea-Păun, pp. 111–112. See also Chesneau, p. 213&lt;/ref&gt; Settling in France for good, he forfeited his inheritance of the Știrbei Palace on [[Calea Victoriei]], which went to his brothers, alongside the [[Buftea]] estates.&lt;ref&gt;Mucenic, pp. 74–75&lt;/ref&gt; Instead, he took his parents' residence in Nice and most of Barbu's French assets. The issue, contested between him and his siblings, was settled at the [[Court of Cassation (France)|Court of Cassation]] in 1873. This landmark case imposed on him to share the villa with the other inheritors, with special criteria for calculating the [[inheritance tax]].&lt;ref&gt;"Art 19,304. Étranger.—Partage.—Biens français et étrangers.—Attribution des biens français à l'un des copartageants.—Droit de soulte.—Partage testamentaire antérieur, non suivi d'effet", in ''Journal de l'Enregistrement et des Domaines'', No. 2703, December 11, 1873, pp. 551–556&lt;/ref&gt; At the time, Știrbei was suing the [[administration of Paris]] for damages to his ''château'', taking [[Jules Favre]] as his lawyer.&lt;ref&gt;"Informations", in ''Journal de Loiret'', August 13, 1873, p. 2&lt;/ref&gt; In 1882, as Paris auctioned off the ruins of [[Tuileries Palace]], also destroyed by the Commune, Știrbei purchased the fence, which became part of Bécon complex.&lt;ref&gt;[[G. Lenotre]], ''Paris révolutionnaire'', p. 101. Paris: [[Firmin Didot]], 1895.  {{OCLC|919952493}}; Bertrand Tillier, ''La Commune de Paris, révolution sans images?

By 1878, Știrbei was a trustee of Le Temps, a [[life insurance]] provider founded by the Alfred Blanche of the [[Conseil d'État (France)|Conseil d'État]].&lt;ref&gt;"Assurances", in ''Annuaire-almanach du Commerce, de l'Industrie, de la Magistrature et de l'Administration'', Vol. 82, 1879, p. 685&lt;/ref&gt; His other sources of income included journalism, with opinion pieces that he signed with the pen name "James Caterly",&lt;ref&gt;Lăcusteanu &amp; Crutzescu, p. 240; Mucenic, p. 74&lt;/ref&gt; and with articles in ''[[Journal des Débats]]''.&lt;ref name="necrLT"/&gt; As such, he was immersing himself in French cultural life. According to [[Georges Duval (journalist)|Georges Duval]], the "excellent prince" Știrbei "discreetly rescued the unfortunate, just as he was providing for the talented ones."&lt;ref name="gdmem287"&gt;[[Georges Duval (journalist)|Georges Duval]], ''Mémoires d'un parisien. Première période"'', p. 287. Paris: [[Groupe Flammarion|Flammarion]], [ca. 1913].  {{OCLC|697992494}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the cultural purge that followed the proclamation of a [[Third French Republic]], Știrbei protected and sponsored sculptor [[Jean-Baptiste Carpeaux]], the aging [[Bonapartist]],&lt;ref&gt;Badea-Păun, pp. 112–113&lt;/ref&gt; purchasing his various works. In 1875, when the Prince took Carpeaux with him to Nice, painter [[Bruno Chérier]] noted a change for the better: "A fairy and her magic wand could not have pulled it off better in transforming our poor Carpeaux." The two, he recalled, lived in "princely luxury".&lt;ref&gt;Guillot, p. 32&lt;/ref&gt; Chesneau calls Știrbei a "grand lord by birth and character", who welcomed Carpeaux with "charming familiarity",&lt;ref&gt;Chesneau, pp. 211–212&lt;/ref&gt; while [[Dugald Sutherland MacColl|D. S. MacColl]] credits him with having "rescued [Carpeaux] from a [[Inferno (Dante)|Dantesque]] misery of disease and squalor."&lt;ref&gt;[[Dugald Sutherland MacColl|D. S. MacColl]], "The Centenary of Carpeaux", in ''[[The Burlington Magazine]]'', Vol. 49, No. 282, September 1926, p. 146&lt;/ref&gt;

In August 1875, when Carpeaux was made Grand Officer of the Legion of Honor, Știrbei was the first to bring him the news, at the church in [[Courbevoie]].&lt;ref name="ldcarp"&gt;[[Loÿs Delteil]], "Carpeaux", in ''Le Peintre Graveur Illustré (XIXe et XXe Siècles)'', Vol. 6 (Rude—Barye—Carpeaux—Rodin), 1910, [n. p.]&lt;/ref&gt; The artist died a few weeks later at Bécon, "consoled by the touching care of his princely host."&lt;ref name="gdmem287"/&gt; Controversially, Știrbei had purchased Carpeaux's drawings (including his study after the cadaver of Victor Liet)&lt;ref&gt;Guillot, pp. 21, 43&lt;/ref&gt; and his seal of authenticity, which technically allowed him to pass [[plaster cast]] as the originals; for several years, he battled in court with the Carpeaux estate over ownership of these items, ultimately relinquishing the seal.&lt;ref&gt;Badea-Păun, pp. 112–113&lt;/ref&gt; Before donating the drawings, Știrbei released them as an album, published using [[photoengraving]].&lt;ref&gt;Chesneau, p. 189&lt;/ref&gt; Carpeaux's tomb was another issue of contention: the Prince had ordered the body to be buried in Courbevoie, giving it a lavish funeral.&lt;ref name="ldcarp"/&gt; The widow, who was kept absent from the ceremony, sued and won, taking the remains to [[Valenciennes]].&lt;ref&gt;Guillot, p. 42&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Pavillon des Indes - éclairage nocturne.jpg|thumb|340px|[[Caspar Purdon Clarke]]'s Indian pavilion, set up by Știrbei in [[Bécon-les-Bruyères]] ([[Courbevoie]])]]
Știrbei was also the patron of [[Rosa Bonheur]]&lt;ref&gt;[[Theodore Stanton]], "The Religion of Rosa Bonheur", in ''[[The Open Court (journal)|The Open Court]]'', Issue 12/1910, pp. 747–748&lt;/ref&gt; and, from 1888, an organizer of the [[Auguste Feyen-Perrin]] collectors' committee.&lt;ref&gt;"Exposition des œuvres de Feyen-Perrin", in ''La Lorraine Artiste'', No. 48/1888, p. 191&lt;/ref&gt; He built up the rest of his art collection with samples from other artists, notably [[Pierre Puvis de Chavannes]], [[Giulio Bergonzoli]], [[Emilio Zocchi]], and [[Gustave Haller|Valérie Simonin]].&lt;ref&gt;Badea-Păun, pp. 112, 114&lt;/ref&gt; The latter, originally an actress, was married to the playwright [[Gustave-Eugène Fould]] (and was as such the daughter-in-law of Bonapartist [[Achille Fould]]). Știrbei had been a confidant of her husband, who gave his daughter [[Georges Achille Fould|Georges Achille]] a male name in honor of Știrbei.&lt;ref name="zmdawn"&gt;Zafar Masud, [https://www.dawn.com/news/1339721 "Art History: The Art of Architecture"], in ''[[Dawn (newspaper)|Dawn]]'', June 18, 2017&lt;/ref&gt; Following Gustave's death in 1884, Valérie remained the Prince's close friend, so much so that in 1888 Știrbei adopted both Georges Achille and her other daughter, [[Consuelo Fould]].&lt;ref&gt;Badea-Păun, p. 114&lt;/ref&gt;

From 1885, Știrbei applied for [[French nationality law|naturalization as a French citizen]],&lt;ref&gt;Badea-Păun, p. 108&lt;/ref&gt; which he obtained in 1888.&lt;ref&gt;Lăcusteanu &amp; Crutzescu, p. 240&lt;/ref&gt; In 1895, he married Simonin. He took personal care of his adoptive daughters' training in art, allowing them to study with [[Léon Comerre]] and [[Ferdinand Roybet]].&lt;ref&gt;Badea-Păun, pp. 114–115&lt;/ref&gt; He also bought [[British Raj|India]] and [[Union between Sweden and Norway|Sweden–Norway]]'s pavilions from the [[Exposition Universelle (1878)|1878 World's Fair]] (respectively designed by [[Caspar Purdon Clarke]] and [[Henrik Thrap-Meyer]]), which became their respective studios.&lt;ref name="smméta"/&gt;&lt;ref name="zmdawn"/&gt;&lt;ref name="LPindes"&gt;{{fr icon}} [http://www.leparisien.fr/espace-premium/hauts-de-seine-92/la-nouvelle-vie-du-pavillon-des-indes-05-05-2015-4745527.php "Hauts-de-Seine. La nouvelle vie du Pavillon des Indes"], in ''[[Le Parisien]]'', May 5, 2015&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Badea-Păun, pp. 114–115&lt;/ref&gt;

===Final decades===
In March 1887, rumors spread that Știrbei intended to replace [[Alexander of Battenberg]] on the [[Principality of Bulgaria|Bulgarian throne]]. According to the ''[[Moskovskiye Vedomosti]]'', he was supported in this by Britain.&lt;ref&gt;"Edición de la Noche. Últimos telegramas", in ''La Iberia. Diario Liberal'', April 11, 1887, p. 2&lt;/ref&gt; Știrbei dismissed such stories, insisting that he had "no intention of reentering the political scene".&lt;ref&gt;"Ultime informațiuni", in ''[[Epoca (Romania)|Epoca]]'', March 26 (April 7), 1887, p. 3&lt;/ref&gt; During that period of his life, although isolated, Știrbei still entertained Romanian guests, including, in 1888, the journalist [[Alexandru Ciurcu]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Alexandru Ciurcu]], "În cestiunea Expozițiunei din 1889", in ''Gazeta Săténului'', Nr. 12/1888, p. 187&lt;/ref&gt;

Following his brother Alexandru's illness and death in early 1895,&lt;ref&gt;Mucenic, pp. 75–76&lt;/ref&gt; George also continued to have links with his Romanian family. In 1901, he and his cousin [[Alexandru Bibescu]] helped organize the Paris wedding between Dimitrie Știrbei's daughter, Martha, and Hans von Blome.&lt;ref&gt;Félix, "Le Monde et la Ville. Salons", in ''[[Le Figaro]]'', November 18, 1901, p. 2&lt;/ref&gt; By then, his large family included numerous figures of importance in politics and literature. Alexandru's children included [[Barbu Știrbey]], the "White Prince", and his brother George, who expanded their father's estate. The "White Prince" in particular reclaimed the family's political role, briefly serving as Prime Minister in 1927. He was famous as the lover of [[List of Romanian consorts|Queen]] [[Marie of Romania]], and alleged father of [[Princess Ileana of Romania|Princess Ileana]].&lt;ref name="așboieri7"/&gt; Barbu's sister [[Eliza Brătianu|Eliza]] was the wife of two other Prime Ministers, [[Alexandru Marghiloman]] and [[Ion I. C. Brătianu]].&lt;ref name="așboieri7"/&gt; Their sisters, who died young, married into the elite: one was the mother of [[George Cretzianu]], and the other the wife of [[Radu R. Rosetti]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Radu R. Rosetti]], ''Mărturisiri, I'', pp. 92, 126–127, 191, 194–195. Bucharest: [[Convorbiri Literare]], 1933&lt;/ref&gt; The Prince also had pilot [[Marina Știrbei]] for a niece, and, on the Bibescu side, nephews [[George Valentin Bibescu]], the aviation pioneer,&lt;ref name="așboieri7"/&gt;&lt;ref name="ccanna"&gt;{{ro icon}} Constantin Ciopraga, [https://web.archive.org/web/20170902224036/http://convorbiri-literare.dntis.ro/CIOPaug8.html "Anna principesă Brâncoveanu contesă de Noailles"], in ''[[Convorbiri Literare]]'', August 2008&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Antoine Bibesco]], who also lived in France and was famous for his friendship with novelist [[Marcel Proust]].&lt;ref&gt;{{ro icon}} Simona Lazăr, [https://web.archive.org/web/20170702142046/http://jurnalul.ro/special-jurnalul/reportaje/printul-alexandru-bibescu-un-sonetist-francez-572252.html "Prințul Alexandru Bibescu, un sonetist francez"], in ''[[Jurnalul Național]]'', March 18, 2011&lt;/ref&gt; A French grandniece, [[Anna de Noailles]], was celebrated for her literary contributions, especially after 1902.&lt;ref name="ccanna"/&gt;

From 1891 to 1902, Știrbei edited a posthumous edition of Weiss' complete works at [[Calmann-Lévy]], followed in 1910 by his monograph ''J.-J. Weiss, conférencier, chroniqueur de théâtre, journaliste''.&lt;ref name="la&amp;al500"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Badea-Păun, p. 108&lt;/ref&gt; His own one-act comedy, ''La légende de Saint Déodat'', came out at [[Firmin Didot]] in 1905, with illustrations by [[Maurice Leloir]].&lt;ref name="la&amp;al500"/&gt; In 1906, Prince George welcomed to Paris the Romanian student [[Eugen Lovinescu]], directing his own research on J.-J. Weiss.&lt;ref&gt;Badea-Păun, pp. 107–108&lt;/ref&gt; At the time, as "James Caterly", he published the monograph ''Les Roumains'' (1908), which Lovinescu would translate and publish in Romania in 1909 or 1910.&lt;ref name="la&amp;al500"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Badea-Păun, p. 108; Filitti, p. 70; Iorga (1910), p. 78&lt;/ref&gt; Știrbei's new protege was reserved in his overall opinion of the prince, writing that his Paris home resembled an old "boyar mansion", replete with ''[[objets d'art]]'' from the Orient. These, Lovinescu believed, were there to show that Știrbei missed his Wallachia.&lt;ref&gt;Badea-Păun, pp. 107–108&lt;/ref&gt; According to Știrbei's own words, he lived "surrounded by memories, by his books, in quiet isolation".&lt;ref&gt;Badea-Păun, pp. 111–112&lt;/ref&gt; From the 1880s onward, he had slowly divided his art objects were between the [[Louvre]], the [[École des Beaux-Arts]], and the [[Musée des Beaux-Arts d'Angers|Angers]] and [[Musée des Beaux-Arts de Valenciennes|Valenciennes Museums]]; others preserved at their original location in Bécon.&lt;ref&gt;Badea-Păun, pp. 112–115; Chesneau, p. 189; Guillot, pp. 21, 43&lt;/ref&gt; He made the news again in August 1910, when one of his most trusted servants stole his wife's jewelry, worth 18,000 [[French franc]]s, from her apartment on Boulevard de Courcelles.&lt;ref&gt;"A travers Paris. La perle des valets de chambre", in ''[[Le Matin (France)|Le Matin]]'', August 5, 1910, p. 5&lt;/ref&gt; 

In 1916, at the height of World War I, Știrbei printed his complete works, including memoirs, as ''Feuilles d'automne et feuilles d'hiver''.&lt;ref name="la&amp;al500"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Badea-Păun, p. 111; Chiper, p. 206; Iorga, ''Correspondance'', p. viii&lt;/ref&gt; He was a widower from July 1919, when the aged Princess Valérie died at [[Pontaillac]].&lt;ref&gt;"Nécrologie" in ''[[Le Gaulois]]'', July 3, 1919, p. 2; "Nouvelles diverses", in ''[[Le Petit Journal (newspaper)|Le Petit Journal]]'', July 3, 1919, p. 3&lt;/ref&gt; Știrbei himself died a nonagenarian on the morning of August 15, 1925.&lt;ref name="necrLT"/&gt; His funeral service was held with military honors at the Catholic church of Saint-Charles-de-Monceau, and his burial took place at [[Père Lachaise Cemetery]].&lt;ref&gt;Serigny, "Le Monde &amp; la Ville. Deuil", in ''[[Le Figaro]]'', August 18, 1925, p. 2; Valfleury, "Nécrologie" in ''[[Le Gaulois]]'', August 18, 1925, p. 2&lt;/ref&gt; In 1926–1928, his daughters were taken to court by the elderly Austrian tenor Georg Schütte Harmsen, who claimed to have been Știrbei's son by a chambermaid. Schütte, who showed records of his Orthodox baptism,&lt;ref&gt;"Tribunaux. Autour de la succession du prince Stirbey", in ''L'Homme Libre'', January 12, 1927, p. 3&lt;/ref&gt; received a positive verdict in primary court, but died "of joy" upon receiving the news.&lt;ref name="alegr6"&gt;{{pt icon}} [http://memoria.bn.br/pdf/025909/per025909_1928_00045.pdf "Alegria que mata"], in ''[[Revista da Semana]]'', Nr. 45/1928, p. 6&lt;/ref&gt; The Carpeaux controversy was prolonged into the 1930s and beyond by the sculptor's daughter Louise Clémentel, who repeated allegations made about Știrbei in her ''La verité sur l'oeuvre et la vie de Jean-Baptiste Carpeaux''.&lt;ref&gt;Badea-Păun, p. 113&lt;/ref&gt; 

In 1928, the Știrbei estate was reportedly worth more than 100 million [[Shilling (British coin)|shilling]].&lt;ref name="alegr6"/&gt; From this total, Consuelo assigned a special fund to the ''[[Institut de France]]'', which grants an annual Știrbei award.&lt;ref&gt;Badea-Păun, p. 113&lt;/ref&gt; She and Georges Achille inherited most of the assets, including the pavilions. The sisters had conflicting visions: Consuelo, who died in 1927, bequeathed her pavilion to host a memorial museum for Roybet; twenty years later, the municipality of Courbevoie confiscated the land for its own city museum.&lt;ref&gt;Badea-Păun, p. 115&lt;/ref&gt; The core buildings of the ''château'' were razed in conjunction with the extension of [[La Défense]], although in the end nothing was built to replace them.&lt;ref name="smméta"/&gt; The former Swedish pavilion is home to a Roybet museum, which also has art by the Fould–Știrbei sisters.&lt;ref name="zmdawn"/&gt; In 2013, the Indian pavilion was restored and, since 2015, has been a studio for [[Artist-in-residence|sculptors-in-residence]].&lt;ref name="zmdawn"/&gt;&lt;ref name="LPindes"/&gt;

== Early life ==
Guy Ullens was born in [[San Francisco]], [[California]] as the third child to Baron Jean Marie Joseph Anne Mathilde Alphonse Ullens de Schooten Whettnall (1897–1950), a Belgian [[diplomat]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Western Machinery and Steel World ... |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=QcEiAQAAMAAJ |volume=37 |year=1946 |pages=118– |quote=...

His mother was ethnographic photographer, writer, and [[Royal Geographical Society]] fellow, Baroness Marie Thérèse Pauline Francis Ullens de Schooten Whettnall ''née'' Wittouck (1905–89), of the Belgium noble family {{Interlanguage link multi|Wittouck|nl}}, a daughter of distilling and sugar magnate {{Interlanguage link multi|Félix Wittouck|fr}}, who together with his brothers {{Interlanguage link multi|Frantz Wittouck|fr|lt=Franz}} and [[Paul Wittouck]] owned the [[Sugar refinery of Tienen]].&lt;ref name="archnet"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://archnet.org/authorities/1910 |title=Marie-Thérèse Ullens de Schooten - Archnet |publisher= |accessdate=21 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://oasis.lib.harvard.edu/oasis/deliver/~mus00019 |title=The Marie-Thérèse, Baroness Ullens de Schooten Collections at Harvard University: original ethnographic sound recordings, radio transmissions, and film soundtracks, ca. 1951-1972 |publisher=Harvard University |accessdate=21 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The family moved to [[Oslo]], Norway shortly after Guy was born, where Jean Ullens took up the diplomatic position of acting [[Envoy (title)|Minister]] for Belgium.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Weekly Commercial News |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=OPMKAQAAIAAJ |volume=89-90 |year=1935 |pages=163– |quote=Jean Ullens de Schooten, consul general for Belgium at San Francisco during the past three years, will leave for home next Saturday preparatory to assuming the position of acting [[Envoy (title)|Minister]] for Belgium at Oslo, Norway.

'''Hendrikus "Hendrik" Colijn '''(22 June 1869 – 18 September 1944) was a Dutch military officer, businessman and politician who served as [[Prime Minister of the Netherlands]] from 1925 to 1926 and again from 1933 to 1939.

==Early life==
He was born on 22 June 1869 in the [[Haarlemmermeer]] to Antonie Colijn and Anna Verkuijl, who had migrated to the newly created Haarlemmermeer polder from the [[Land of Heusden and Altena]] for religious reasons. He was the first of six children, all born in [[Haarlemmermeer]]. Colijn grew up in the [[Land of Altena]].

==Military service==
[[File:Colijn,-Hendrikus.jpg|thumb|right|Colijn in 1905]]
[[File:COLLECTIE TROPENMUSEUM Het huis van Hendrik Colijn te Seulimeum Atjeh TMnr 60038948.jpg|thumb|right|Hendrik Colijn's house in Aceh (1890&amp;ndash;1920)]]
At the age of 16, he went to a military academy in [[Kampen, Overijssel|Kampen]] for officer training, where he graduated as a 2nd lieutenant in 1892. On 18 September 1893, he married Helena Groenenberg (23 September 1867 – 14 February 1947).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.genealogieonline.nl/stamboom-de-kanter/I3715.php|title=Helena Groenenberg (1867-1947) » Stamboom De Kanter » Genealogie Online|first=C.N.|last=Cardinaal|website=Genealogie Online}}&lt;/ref&gt; and was sent to the [[Dutch East Indies]]. During his 16 years in the Dutch East Indies, he spent ten years in the [[KNIL|Colonial Army]], serving in the [[Aceh War]] as the lieutenant of [[J. B. van Heutsz]], and six further years in the Colonial administration, having the same role towards van Heutsz when the latter became Governor General in 1904.

Colijn's letters to his wife from his period on Lombok reveal his participation in acts of brutality which by modern standards would be considered severe [[war crimes]]:

&lt;blockquote&gt;I have seen a mother carrying a child of about 6 months old on her left arm, with a long lance in her right hand, who was running in our direction. One of our bullets killed the mother as well as the child. From now on we couldn't give any mercy, it was over. I did give orders to gather a group of 9 women and 3 children who asked for mercy and they were shot all together. It was not a pleasant job, but something else was impossible. Our soldiers tacked them with pleasure with their bayonets. It was horrible. I will stop reporting now.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://home.iae.nl/users/arcengel/NedIndie/introengels.htm|title=Introduction to the History of the Dutch East Indies  Aad 'Arcengel' Engelfriet|first=Aad|last=Engelfriet|website=home.iae.nl}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Political life==
After his return to the Netherlands in 1909, he was elected as an [[Anti-Revolutionary Party]] Member of Parliament for the district Sneek (Before 1918, the Dutch voting system was the same as the British).

In 1911, he was appointed Minister of War&lt;ref name="age"&gt;{{cite news|title=Defense in two spheres - Holland's New Cabinet|url=https://www.newspapers.com/clip/10973002/colijn_1939_intro/|newspaper= The Age|date=May 25, 1939|page=8|via = [[Newspapers.com]]|accessdate = May 13, 2017 }} {{free access}}&lt;/ref&gt; and revised the Dutch [[Selective Service]] System. In May 1918 he acted as an intermediary between the British and [[Kaiser Wilhelm II]] of Germany to arrange an armistice, resulting in the Kaiser getting refuge in The Netherlands.

==Business life==
In 1910 the Holland Dakota Landbouw Compagnie is established&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://krantenbankzeeland.nl/issue/mco/1910-06-06/edition/0/page/7?query=Compagnie+van+Bet&amp;sort=relevanceKrantenbank|title=Middelburgsche Courant - 6 juni 1910 - pagina 7|website=Krantenbank Zeeland}}&lt;/ref&gt; with Hendrikus Colijn and his brother [[:nl:Arie Colijn]] as the primary share holders.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=https://www.academia.edu/6630263/_Anthonie_Colijn_1870-1932_._Boer_boerenvoorman_burgemeester_in_P.E._Werkman_en_R.E._van_der_Woude_red._Wie_in_de_politiek_gaat_is_weg_Protestantse_politici_en_de_christelijk-sociale_beweging_Hilversum_Verloren_2009_pp._151-176|title=‘Anthonie Colijn (1870-1932).

Protestantse politici en de christelijk-sociale beweging (Hilversum: Verloren 2009), pp. 151-176.|first=Mari|last=Smits|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

From 1914 to 1922 he served as CEO for the [[Bataafse Petroleum Maatschappij]] (BPM). In 1925, he also became CEO of [[Royal Dutch Shell]].

==Prime minister==
In 1922 he accepted the political leadership of the Anti-Revolutionary Party (Calvinist) from Dr. [[Abraham Kuyper]]. Already one year later he succeeded resigning minister [[Dirk Jan de Geer]] as [[Ministry of Finance (Netherlands)|Minister of Finance]].&lt;ref name="age" /&gt; In 1925 Colijn also became prime minister,&lt;ref name="age" /&gt; but a year later Colijn had to step down when the [[House of Representatives (Netherlands)|House of Representatives]] accepted a resolution by [[Gerrit Hendrik Kersten]] of the Protestant [[Reformed Political Party]] which called for diplomatic ties with the Vatican to be broken. This was unacceptable to the [[Roman Catholic State Party]] then in government.&lt;ref&gt;{{nl icon}} [https://www.trouw.nl/home/vaticaan-moet-plaats-kennen~a203384d/ Vaticaan moet plaats kennen]; by [[Lousewies van der Laan]], [[Elly Plooij-van Gorsel]] and {{ill|Joke Swiebel|nl}}, ''[[Trouw]]'', 18 November 2000&lt;/ref&gt; Colijn then returned to the [[Senate (Netherlands)|Senate]], and from 1927 to 1929, he served as head of the Dutch delegation to the [[League of Nations]] in Geneva. At the [[Dutch general election, 1929|elections of 1929]] he was elected for the House of Representatives, and immediately became [[Parliamentary leader]] of his party. This proved to be a success: at the [[Dutch general election, 1933|elections of 1933]] the ARP gained two seats, and Colijn became Prime Minister again.&lt;ref name="age" /&gt; From 1933&amp;ndash;1939 he served four more times as prime minister. During the 1930s his government faced the effects of the [[Great Depression in the Netherlands|Great Depression]], which took a heavy toll on the Netherlands. Colijn's government responded to the economic crisis with a very strict fiscal policy, which may have further weakened the Dutch economy. Colijn's decision to adhere to the [[Gold Standard]] until 1937, long after most of the trading partners of the Netherlands had dropped it, also played a role in lengthening the economic crisis. In 1939, his latest cabinet, with Protestant and liberal ministers but without Catholic ministers, lasted only three days before a government crisis.

==World War II and death==
After the Dutch defeat in the [[Battle of the Netherlands]] in 1940, he published an essay entitled "On the Border of Two Worlds",&lt;ref&gt;[http://resources21.kb.nl/gvn/EVDO02/pdf/EVDO02_NIOD05_0817.pdf DE GRENS V A N TWEE WERELDEN]{{dead link|date=December 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; in which he called for accepting German leadership in Europe, immediately after the Royal House had fled to England, leaving him behind. His view was influenced by the tremendous show of force the German blitzkrieg had shown and the relative weakness of the Allied forces. Soon thereafter, he tried to organize political resistance but was arrested in June 1941 and taken to [[Berlin]] for interrogation. The Germans tried to have him confess that he had conspired with the British to invade the Netherlands to serve as an excuse for the German invasion.

Late in the war after the tide had turned against the Germans, according to a grandson, Himmler wanted to keep Colijn available as a possible intermediary with the British, as he had done earlier for [[Wilhelm II]]. The very fact that the [[Gestapo]] allowed the visit suggests that Himmler was already making contingency plans in case of a German loss. In March 1943 Colijn was put under house arrest in a remote mountain hotel in Ilmenau, where he died on 18 September 1944.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.parlement.com/id/vg09lkz7m8z5/h_hendrik_colijn%7CParliamentary|title=Dr. H.

'''Henry Algernon du Pont''' (July 30, 1838 &amp;ndash; December 31, 1926) was an [[United States|American]] [[officer (armed forces)|military officer]], businessman, and [[politician]] from [[Delaware]]. A member of the famed [[Du Pont family]], he graduated first in his class from [[United States Military Academy|West Point]] shortly after the beginning of the [[American Civil War]] and served in the [[Union Army|U.S. Army]], earning the [[Medal of Honor]] for his actions during the [[Battle of Cedar Creek]] in October 1864.

After retiring from the Army in 1875, he was president of the [[Wilmington and Northern Railroad]] Company for 20 years, until 1899.  An active member of the [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican Party]], he was elected by the state legislature as a [[United States Senate|U.S. Senator]] from [[Delaware]], serving most of two terms (June 13, 1906 to March 4, 1917).

==Early life and education==
Du Pont was born July 30, 1838, at [[Eleutherian Mills]], near [[Greenville, Delaware|Greenville]], Delaware, son of [[Henry du Pont|Henry]] and Louisa Gerhard du Pont and grandson of [[Eleuthère Irénée du Pont]], the founder of [[DuPont|E. I. du Pont de Nemours and Company]] and the family in the United States.

He attended the [[University of Pennsylvania]] in Philadelphia, and graduated first in his class from the [[United States Military Academy]] at [[West Point, New York]] in 1861, after the beginning of the [[American Civil War]].

==Civil war and military career==
Du Pont was commissioned a 2nd Lieutenant of Engineers upon his graduation from West Point on May 6, 1861. Soon after he was promoted to 1st Lieutenant in the 5th Regiment, U.S. Artillery with date of rank of May 14, 1861.  He served as a light artillery officer in the Union Army during the war, initially assigned to the defenses of Washington and New York Harbor.  From July 6, 1861 to March 24, 1864, he served as regimental adjutant (administrative officer) until he was promoted to captain. He subsequently became chief of artillery in the [[Army of West Virginia]].

Du Pont was part of General [[Philip Sheridan]]'s army in the [[Shenandoah Valley]] of northern Virginia. He received the [[Medal of Honor]] for his handling of a retreat at the [[Battle of Cedar Creek]], allowing Sheridan to win a victory in the battle.  During the war, du Pont received two brevets (honorary promotions).  The first was to the rank of major, dated September 19, 1864, for gallant service in the battles of [[Third Battle of Winchester|Opequon]] and [[Battle of Fisher's Hill|Fisher's Hill]]. The second brevet was to the rank of lieutenant colonel, dated October 19, 1864, for distinguished service at the Battle of Cedar Creek, Virginia.

After the war, du Pont continued as a career officer until resigning on March 1, 1875. In the postwar years, he became a companion of the [[Military Order of the Loyal Legion of the United States]] (MOLLUS), an organization for former officers of the Union Army and their descendants. Assigned to the U.S. capital, du Pont was a member of the District of Columbia Commandery, assigned MOLLUS insignia number 10418.

==Marriage and family==
At the age of 36, du Pont married Mary Pauline Foster in 1874.  They had two children, [[Henry Francis du Pont]] and [[Louise E. du Pont Crowninshield|Louise Evelina du Pont]]. They lived on his estate, [[Winterthur Museum and Grounds|Winterthur]], near Greenville, Delaware. The family were members of Christ Episcopal Church in [[Christiana Hundred]].

==Business career==
In 1875 du Pont returned full-time to Delaware.  Within a few years, he became president and general manager of the Wilmington &amp; Northern Railroad Company, serving from 1879 until 1899. During that time, and for the remainder of his life, he also operated an experimental farm on his estate.  Since 1951, when his son established it as a museum, the estate has been operated as the [[Winterthur Museum and Country Estate]] near Greenville, Delaware.

==Political career==
Du Pont was elected to the U.S. Senate on June 13, 1906, to fill the vacancy in the term beginning March 4, 1905. During this term, he served with the Republican majority in the 59th, 60th, and 61st U.S. Congress. In the 61st Congress, he was Chairman of the [[United States Senate Committee on Armed Services|Committee on Expenditures in the Military Affairs Department]].

He was again elected to the U.S. Senate in 1911. During this term, he served with the Republican majority in the 62nd Congress, but was in the minority in the 63rd, and 64th U.S. Congress. In the 62nd Congress he was again Chairman of the Committee on Expenditures in the War Department, in the 63rd Congress he was a member of the Committee on Military Affairs, and in the 64th Congress he was a member of the Committee on Transportation and Sale of Meat Products.

In the first popular election of a U.S. Senator in Delaware, du Pont lost his bid for a third full term in 1916 to Democrat Josiah O. Wolcott, the Delaware Attorney General. In all, he served most of two terms from June 13, 1906 to March 4, 1917, during the administrations of U.S. Presidents [[Theodore Roosevelt]], [[William H. Taft]] and [[Woodrow Wilson]].

==Death and legacy==
Henry A. du Pont died at his home, ''Winterthur,'' and is buried in the [[Du Pont de Nemours Cemetery]] at [[Greenville, Delaware]]. His son, Henry Francis du Pont, developed his home into the well-known [[Winterthur Museum and Grounds|Winterthur Museum]]. Archival materials relating to him are part of the archives owned by the museum at Greenville, near Wilmington.

:By his distinguished gallantry, and voluntary exposure to the enemy's fire at a critical moment, when the Union line had been broken, encouraged his men to stand to their guns, checked the advance of the enemy, and brought off most of his pieces.

==In popular culture==
DuPont was portrayed by [[David Arquette]] in the 2014 film ''[[Field of Lost Shoes]]'', which depicted the Battle of New Market in May 1864.

'''Henry Morgenthau''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|m|ɔːr|ɡ|ən|t|aʊ}}; April 26, 1856 – November 25, 1946) was an American lawyer, businessman and [[Ambassadors of the United States|United States ambassador]], most famous as the [[United States Ambassador to Turkey|American ambassador to the Ottoman Empire]] during the [[First World War]]. As ambassador to the Ottoman Empire, Morgenthau has come to be identified as the most prominent American to speak  about the [[Armenian Genocide]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last= Balakian |first= Peter  |authorlink =Peter Balakian |title= The Burning Tigris: The Armenian Genocide and America's Response |publisher= HarperCollins |location= New York |year= 2003 |pages=219–221  |isbn=0-06-055870-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Morgenthau was the father of the politician [[Henry Morgenthau Jr.]]  His grandchildren included [[Robert M. Morgenthau]], [[District Attorney]] of [[Manhattan]] for 35 years, and [[Pulitzer Prize]] winning historian [[Barbara W. Tuchman]].

==Life==
Morgenthau was born, the ninth of 11 living children, in [[Mannheim]], [[Grand Duchy of Baden]], in 1856 into an [[Ashkenazi Jewish]] family. He was the son of Lazarus and Babette (Guggenheim) Morgenthau.&lt;ref&gt;http://findingaids.cjh.org/?pID=480672&lt;/ref&gt; His father was a successful cigar manufacturer who had cigar factories at [[Mannheim]], [[Lorsch]] and [[Heppenheim]], employing as many as 1,000 people (Mannheim had a population of 21,000 during this period). Having suffered a severe financial setback during the [[American Civil War]], due to an 1862 tobacco tariff on imports, which closed German tobacco exports to the US forever, the family emigrated to New York in 1866. There, despite a considerable "nest egg" of cash, his father was unsuccessful in re-establishing himself in business, as his development and marketing of various inventions and his investments in other enterprises failed. Lazarus Morgenthau was able to stave off failure and stabilize his income by becoming a fundraiser for Jewish houses of worship. Henry attended [[City College of New York]], where he received a [[Bachelor of Arts|BA]], and later graduated from [[Columbia Law School]].

He began his career as a lawyer, but he made a substantial fortune in real estate investments.&lt;ref&gt;Balakian. ''The Burning Tigris'', p. 219.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1898, he acquired 41 lots on New York's Lower East Side from William Waldorf Astor for $850,000. &lt;ref&gt;"Col. Astor Sells a Block," [https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1900/12/06/108282308.pdf The New York Times, Dec. 6, 1900].&lt;/ref&gt; A few years later, he led a syndicate that bought a swath of undeveloped land in Washington Heights around 181st Street, anticipating the construction of the first subway through the area. &lt;ref&gt;Clifton Hood, "The Impact of the IRT on New York City," in Historical American Engineering Record, Survey Number HAER NY-122, pp. 145-206, available at https://www.nycsubway.org/wiki/The_Impact_of_the_IRT_on_New_York_City_(Hood).&lt;/ref&gt;

He married Josephine Sykes in 1882 and had four children: [[Helen Morgenthau Fox|Helen]], Alma, [[Henry Morgenthau Jr.|Henry Jr.]] and Ruth.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20111008222614/http://www.henrymorgenthaupreserve.com/index.php?page=henry-morgenthau About Henry Morgenthau]. henrymorgenthaupreserve.com&lt;/ref&gt; His daughter Alma was married to financier [[Maurice Wertheim]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|last=  |first=  |authorlink=   |title= Mrs. Wertheim to Marry Paul L.

Morgenthau's career enabled him to contribute handsomely to President [[Woodrow Wilson]]'s election campaign in 1912. He had first met Wilson in 1911 at a dinner celebrating the fourth anniversary of the founding of the [[Stephen Wise Free Synagogue|Free Synagogue society]] and the two "seem to have bonded", marking the "turning point in Morgenthau's political career".&lt;ref&gt;Balakian. ''The Burning Tigris'', p. 220.&lt;/ref&gt; His role in American politics grew more pronounced in later months and though his desire to be designated the financial chairman of the campaign finance committee went unfulfilled, Wilson offered him the position of ambassador to the [[Ottoman Empire]]. He had hoped for a cabinet post as well, but was not successful in gaining one.

[[Image:AmbassadorMorgenthautelegram.jpg|thumb|left|210px|A telegram written by Morgenthau to the [[State Department]] in 1915 described the massacres of Armenians in the Ottoman Empire as a "campaign of race extermination".]]

As an early Wilson supporter, Morgenthau assumed that Wilson would appoint him to a cabinet-level position, but the new President had other plans for him; like other prominent Jewish Americans, [[Oscar Straus (politician)|Oscar Straus]] and [[Solomon Hirsch]] before him, Morgenthau would be posted as the ambassador to the [[Ottoman Empire]]. Wilson's assumption that Jews somehow represented a bridge between Muslim Turks and Christian Armenians rankled Morgenthau; in reply Wilson assured him that the [[Ottoman Porte|Porte]] in Istanbul "was the point at which the interest of American Jews in the welfare of the Jews of [[Ottoman Syria | Palestine]] is focused, and it is almost indispensable that I have a Jew in that post".  Though no Zionist himself, Morgenthau cared "fervidly" about the plight of his coreligionists.&lt;ref&gt;Oren. ''Power, Faith, and Fantasy'', p. 333.&lt;/ref&gt; He initially rejected the position, but following a trip to Europe, and with the encouragement of his [[Streams of Zionism|pro-Zionist]] friend Rabbi [[Stephen Wise]], he reconsidered his decision and accepted Wilson's offer.&lt;ref&gt;Balakian. ''The Burning Tigris'', p. 222.&lt;/ref&gt; Appointed as [[United States Ambassador to Turkey|U.S. Ambassador to the Ottoman Empire]] in 1913, he served in this position until 1916.

Although the safety of American citizens in the Ottoman Empire, mostly Christian missionaries and Jews, loomed large early in his ambassadorship, Morgenthau stated that the one issue that most preoccupied him was the [[Armenian Question]].&lt;ref&gt;Balakian. ''The Burning Tigris'', p. 223.&lt;/ref&gt; After the [[World War I|outbreak of war]] in 1914, the U.S. remained neutral, so the American Embassy – and by extension Morgenthau – additionally represented many of the Allies' interests in [[Constantinople]], since they had withdrawn their diplomatic missions due to the hostilities. As Ottoman authorities began the [[Armenian Genocide]] in 1914–1915, the American consuls residing in different parts of the Empire flooded Morgenthau's desk with reports nearly every hour,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1= Oren |first1= Michael B. |author-link1= Michael Oren |chapter= Spectators of Catastrophe |title= Power, Faith, and Fantasy: America in the Middle East, 1776 to the Present | url= https://books.google.com/books?id=3DkX6Uo0gwIC | series= Armenian Research Center collection| publisher= W.

The American government however, not wanting to get dragged into disputes, remained a neutral power in the conflict at the time and voiced little official reaction. Morgenthau held high-level meetings with the leaders of the Ottoman Empire to help alleviate the position of the Armenians, but the Turks waived and ignored his protestations. He famously admonished the Ottoman Interior Minister [[Talaat Pasha]], stating: "Our people will never forget these massacres."&lt;ref&gt;Oren. ''Power, Faith, and Fantasy'', p. 335.&lt;/ref&gt; As the massacres continued unabated, Morgenthau and several other Americans decided to form a public fund-raising committee that would assist the Armenians – the Committee on Armenian Atrocities (later renamed the [[American Committee for Relief in the Near East|Near East Relief]]) – raising over $100 million in aid, the equivalent of $1 billion today. Through his friendship with [[Adolph Ochs]], publisher of the ''[[New York Times]]'', Morgenthau also ensured that the massacres continued to receive prominent coverage, with 145 articles in 1915 alone.&lt;ref&gt;Oren. ''Power, Faith, and Fantasy'', p. 336.&lt;/ref&gt; 

Exasperated with his relationship with the Ottoman government, he resigned from the ambassadorship in 1916. Looking back on that decision in his ''The Murder of a Nation'', he wrote he had come to see Turkey as "a place of horror. I had reached the end of my resources. I found intolerable my further daily association with men, however gracious and accommodating…who were still reeking with the blood of nearly a million human beings."&lt;ref&gt;Oren. ''Power, Faith, and Fantasy'', p. 337.&lt;/ref&gt; He published his conversations with Ottoman leaders and his account of the Armenian genocide in 1918 under the title ''Ambassador Morgenthau's Story''.&lt;ref&gt;Morgenthau, Henry (1918). ''Ambassador Morgenthau's Story''. Garden City, N.Y.: Doubleday.&lt;/ref&gt;

In June 1917 [[Felix Frankfurter]] accompanied Morgenthau, as a representative of the War Department, on a secret mission to persuade Turkey to abandon the [[Central Powers]] in the war effort. The mission had as its stated purpose to "ameliorate the condition of the Jewish communities in Palestine".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last= Hirsch  | first = H. N. |title= The Enigma of Felix Frankfurter |publisher=Basic Books |location= New York |year= 1981 |page=53  |isbn=0-465-01979-X}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1918 Morgenthau gave public speeches in the United States warning that the Greeks and Assyrians were being subjected to the "same methods" of deportation and "wholesale massacre" as the Armenians, and that two million Armenians, Greeks, and Assyrians had already perished.&lt;ref name="Genocide Studies and Prevention"&gt;Travis, Hannibal.

== Interwar period ==
Following the war, there was much interest and preparation within the Jewish community for the forthcoming [[Paris Peace Conference, 1919|Paris Peace Conference]], by groups both supportive and opposed to the concept of a Jewish homeland in Palestine.  In March 1919, as President Woodrow Wilson was leaving for the Conference, Morgenthau was among 31 prominent Jewish Americans to sign an anti-Zionist petition presented by U.S. Congressman [[Julius Kahn (congressman)|Julius Kahn]];&lt;ref&gt;[[Alfred M. Lilienthal]], ''The Zionist Connection II: What Price Peace?'' (New Brunswick, New Jersey: North American, 1982),  pp. 768–769. Cited in  Edward C.

Morgenthau served as an advisor regarding Eastern Europe and the Middle East, and later worked with war-related charitable bodies, including the Relief Committee for the Middle East, the Greek Refugee Settlement Commission and the [[American Red Cross]]. In 1919 he headed the United States government fact-finding mission to Poland resulting in the [[Morgenthau Report]]. In 1933, he was the American representative at the [[Geneva Conference (1932)|Geneva Conference]]

'''William Jackson "Jack" Pitney''' (January 5, 1963 &amp;ndash; August 26, 2010) was an American marketing executive with [[BMW]] as vice president of marketing, where he played a major role in convincing company leadership to go ahead with distribution of the [[Mini (marque)|MINI]] in the United States, despite concerns that car buyers there would not buy cars that small given the popularity of [[sport utility vehicle]]s.

Pitney was born in 1963 in [[Stamford, Connecticut]] and earned his undergraduate degree from [[Occidental College]], where he majored in political science. He worked in the public relations and advertising field, and was hired in 1988 by the [[Grey Global Group|GCI Group]], where he worked on a 1990 advertising campaign for [[Infiniti]]. At [[Hill &amp; Knowlton]] he worked on the [[Mazda North American Operations|Mazda Motor of America]] account and later was hired by Mazda as its manager of corporate communications.&lt;ref name=NYTObit&gt;Grimes, William. [https://www.nytimes.com/2010/08/28/business/media/28pitney.html "Jack Pitney, Who Made Much of the MINI, Dies at 47"], ''[[The New York Times]]'', August 27, 2010. Accessed September 2, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

Pitney was hired by BMW of North America in 1995 as head of corporate communications, where he developed advertising campaigns for its high-performance vehicles.&lt;ref&gt;Staff. [http://www.detnews.com/article/20100827/AUTO01/8270423/1361/BMW-mourns-loss-of-Jack-Pitney "BMW mourns loss of Jack Pitney"], ''[[The Detroit News]]'', August 27, 2010. Accessed September 2, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; BMW developed the Mini in 2001 as a successor to the original [[Mini]], which enjoyed a cult following in the 1960s. BMW executives were reluctant to market the car in the United States, presuming that car buyers in that country would be unlikely to purchase a car so small given the widespread prevalence of SUVs.&lt;ref name=NYTObit/&gt; In 2001, Pitney was named as general manager for the Mini line.&lt;ref&gt;Staff. [https://www.nytimes.com/2001/01/17/business/executive-changes-470759.html "EXECUTIVE CHANGES"], ''[[The New York Times]]'', January 17, 2001. Accessed September 2, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; The company agreed to market the car in the U.S. with very low expectations, but Pitney developed a marketing campaign together with [[Crispin Porter + Bogusky]] that used [[viral marketing]] on the web and featured billboards promoting the car under the catchphrases "The SUV Backlash Officially Starts Now" and "0% Body Fat". By the March 2002 American launch date for the Mini, 53% of people were aware of the brand and 50,000 people had expressed potential interest on the company's website in buying the car.&lt;ref name=NYTObit/&gt;

The Mini was positioned at a higher price than many comparably sized vehicles, but was promoted as a car that could be accessorized by its owners.&lt;ref name=SLObit&gt;Perone, Joseph R. [http://www.nj.com/business/index.ssf/2010/08/bmws_jack_pitney_dies_in_tragi.html "BMW's 'Creative powerhouse' Jack Pitney, dead at 47 in farm accident"], ''[[The Star-Ledger]]'', August 27, 2010. Accessed September 2, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; Recognized as one of the few car division heads to come from the advertising side of the business ''[[Automotive News]]'' selected Pitney as one of its two Marketers of the Year in January 2003.&lt;ref&gt;Staff. [http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-96556480.html "MINI marketing chief proves them wrong; A marketer of the year helps car surpass sales expectations"], ''[[Automotive News]]'', January 13, 2003. Accessed September 2, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; Annual sales reached 30,000, exceeding initial projections by 50%.&lt;ref name=NYTObit/&gt; The success of the MINI earned Pitney a promotion to Vice President of Marketing, where he was responsible for multiple launches including the new [[BMW 1 Series]], the [[BMW X6]], the [[BMW 7 Series]], the [[BMW Z4]], [[BMW diesel engines]], and the [[BMW 5 Series]].

As of September 1, 2010, he was supposed to assume the post of Vice President of BMW's Eastern region, where he would have overseen the 93 dealerships on the [[East Coast of the United States]], including the many centered in the [[New York metropolitan area]].&lt;ref name=NYTObit/&gt;

==Death==
A resident of [[Ridgewood, New Jersey]], Pitney died at age 47 on August 26, 2010, when the tractor he was riding while on vacation at his farm in [[Durham, New York]] overturned on him while pulling out a tree stump.&lt;ref name=NYTObit/&gt; He was found by officers of the [[Greene County, New York]] Sheriff's Department trapped underneath the tractor and was pronounced dead at the scene.&lt;ref name=SLObit/&gt; He was survived by his wife and five children.&lt;ref name=NYTObit/&gt;

[[Amsterdam]]-based side Ajax put the Dutch on the map by reaching the final of the European Cup in 1969, but it was their Rotterdam-based rivals Feyenoord that ushered in a new European order the following year by taking home the trophy. &lt;br/&gt; The stage was then set for Ajax to galvanise the game. Masterminded by the dazzling attacking skills of local boy Johan Cruyff, Ajax swept all before them with their swashbuckling 'total football', in which defenders and attackers exchanged positions, leaving opponents bewildered and beaten. &lt;br/&gt; Ajax lifted the Champion Clubs' Cup in 1971, 1972 and 1973, as well as winning the hearts of football enthusiasts. "Dutch football was very much emerging at that time", said Cruyff. "It was a really different development for football itself… and it had an enormous impact on the whole world, which eventually led to a lot of respect for Dutch football." |date=27 August 2014 |accessdate=28 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.espnfc.com/blog/espn-fc-united-blog/68/post/2836000/johan-cruyff-refined-total-football-as-games-trailblazer |author=[[Gabriele Marcotti|Marcotti, Gabriele]] |title=Johan Cruyff was one of football's greatest trailblazers on and off pitch |publisher=ESPN FC |quote=There was also no rational reason why Dutch football should produce someone like Cruyff at the time that he began kicking around a ball in the East Amsterdam planned neighbourhood of Betondorp... Until he pulled on the Oranje jersey, the Dutch national team had failed to qualify for a major tournament since before World War II. No Dutch side had won European silverware.

After a second appearance in 1938, they did not appear in another World Cup until 1974. As [[Simon Kuper]] (in "Holland, a Country of Clubs") noted, "The mere fact that almost everyone in Holland plays football cannot itself explain the country's success. Until the 1970s Dutch football was mediocre. Holland would occasionally lose to Luxembourg, and considered their main rivals to be Belgium."&lt;/ref&gt; Cruyff led the [[Netherlands national football team|Netherlands]] to the final of the [[1974 FIFA World Cup]] and received the [[Golden Ball (FIFA)|Golden Ball]] as player of the tournament.&lt;ref name="FIFA Profile"&gt;[https://www.fifa.com/fifa-tournaments/players-coaches/people=1043/profile.html "The Netherlands' Grand Master"].

After retiring from playing in 1984, Cruyff became highly successful as [[Manager (association football)|manager]] of Ajax and later Barcelona; he remained an influential advisor to both clubs. His son [[Jordi Cruyff|Jordi]] also played football professionally.

In 1999, Cruyff was voted European Player of the Century in an election held by the [[International Federation of Football History &amp; Statistics]], and came second behind [[Pelé]] in their [[FIFA Player of the Century#Vote specialists (IFFHS)|World Player of the Century]] poll.&lt;ref name="RSSSF"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rsssf.com/miscellaneous/iffhs-century.html |title=IFFHS' Century Elections |work = rsssf.com |accessdate= 22 March 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; He came third in a vote organised by the French magazine ''[[France Football]]'' consulting their former Ballon d'Or winners to elect their Football Player of the Century.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rsssf.com/miscellaneous/best-x-players-of-y.html#ff-poc |title=The Best x Players of the Century/All-Time |publisher=[[RSSSF]] |accessdate=18 March 2007 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151231035356/http://www.rsssf.com/miscellaneous/best-x-players-of-y.html |archivedate=31 December 2015 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; He was chosen on the [[World Team of the 20th Century]] in 1998, the [[FIFA World Cup Dream Team]] in 2002, and in 2004 was named in the [[FIFA 100]] list of the world's greatest living players.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/football/3533891.stm |title=Pele's list of the greatest |publisher=BBC Sport |date=4 March 2004 |accessdate=16 November 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life==
{{Quote box|width=32%|align=right|quote=I was born shortly after the war, though, and was taught not to just accept anything.|source=—Cruyff said in a documentary on TV3 channel (2015).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.goal.com/en-gb/news/2892/transfer-zone/2015/01/21/8158842/cruyff-i-nearly-joined-real-madrid |author=Coerts, Stefan |title=''Cruyff: I nearly joined Real Madrid'' |publisher=Goal.com |date=21 January 2015 |accessdate=20 October 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Hendrik Johannes "Johan" Cruijff was born on 25 April 1947 in [[Amsterdam]], on a street five minutes away from [[AFC Ajax|Ajax]]'s stadium, his first football club. Johan was the second son of Hermanus Cornelis Cruijff and Petronella Bernarda Draaijer, from a humble, working-class background in east Amsterdam. Cruyff, encouraged by his influential football-loving father and his close proximity in Akkerstraat to the De Meer Stadium, played football with his schoolmates and older brother, Henny, whenever he could, and idolised the prolific Dutch dribbler, [[Faas Wilkes]].

In 1959, Cruyff's father died from a heart attack. His father's death had a major impact on his mentality. As Cruyff recalled, in celebration of his 50th birthday, "My father died when I was just 12 and he was 45.

===Club career===

====Ajax and the golden era of Total Football====
[[File:Feyenoord tegen Ajax 1-0. Nummer 26 Israel in duel met Cruyff.jpg|thumb|right|Cruyff was instrumental in Ajax's dominance of [[European football]] in the early 1970s. He played for Ajax from 1957 to 1973 and 1981 to 1983 (seen here in 1967 against Feyenoord).]]
Cruyff joined the Ajax youth system on his tenth birthday. Cruyff and his friends would frequent a "playground" in their neighbourhood and Ajax youth coach Jany van der Veen, who lived close by, noticed Cruyff's talent and decided to offer him a place at Ajax without a formal trial.&lt;ref name="Early life"/&gt; He showed talent both on the [[pitcher's mound]] and behind the plate, as a [[catcher (baseball)|catcher]], before having to leave [[Ajax HVA|the club's baseball section]] at age 15 to focus on football.&lt;ref&gt;[http://afootballreport.com/post/11609198668/when-the-beautiful-game-met-americas-national-pastime "When The Beautiful Game Met America's National Pastime"]. Football Report. Retrieved 12 May 2014&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www1.skysports.com/other-sports/news/13873/6312071/i-love-football-cruyff "I love football... Cruyff"]. Sky Sports. Retrieved 12 May 2014&lt;/ref&gt; He made his first team debut on 15 November 1964 in the [[Eredivisie]], against [[FC Groningen|GVAV]], scoring the only goal for Ajax in a 3–1 defeat. That year, Ajax finished in their lowest position since the establishment of professional football, in 13th.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.eredivisie.nl/history/1964–1965.html |title=Historie eredivisie competitie 1964–1965 |access-date=14 September 2016}}{{dead link|date=September 2016|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}. eredivisie.nl&lt;/ref&gt; Cruyff really started to make an impression in the 1965–66 season and established himself as a regular first team player after scoring two goals against [[AFC DWS|DWS]] in the Olympic stadium on 24 October 1965 in a 2–0 victory. In the seven games that winter, he scored eight times and in March 1966 scored the first three goals in a league game against Telstar in a 6–2 win. Four days later, in a cup game against [[BV Veendam|Veendam]] in a 7–0 win, he scored four goals. In total that season, Cruyff scored 25 goals in 23 games, and Ajax won the league championship.&lt;ref name="FIFA Profile"/&gt;
[[File:Ajax tegen Liverpool 5-1, Johan Cruyff in duel.jpg|thumb|left|Cruyff playing for Ajax taking on [[Liverpool F.C.|Liverpool]] defender [[Tommy Smith (footballer, born 1945)|Tommy Smith]] in a European Cup game in December 1966]]
In the [[1966–67 Eredivisie|1966–67 season]], Ajax again won the league championship, and also won the [[KNVB Cup]], for Cruyff's first "double".&lt;ref name="FIFA Profile"/&gt; Cruyff ended the season as the leading goalscorer in the Eredivisie with 33. Cruyff won the league for the third successive year in the [[1967–68 Eredivisie|1967–68 season]]. He was also named Dutch footballer of the year for the second successive time, a feat he repeated in 1969.&lt;ref name="FIFA Profile"/&gt; On 28 May 1969, Cruyff played in his first [[UEFA Champions League|European Cup]] final against [[A.C. Milan|Milan]], but the Italians won 4–1.

In the [[1969–70 Eredivisie|1969–70 season]], Cruyff won his second league and cup "double"; at the beginning of the [[1970–71 Eredivisie|1970–71 season]], he suffered a groin injury. He made his comeback on 30 October 1970 against [[PSV Eindhoven|PSV]], and rather than wear his usual number 9, which was in use by [[Gerrie Mühren]], he instead used number 14.&lt;ref name="FIFA Profile"/&gt; Ajax won 1–0. Although it was very uncommon in those days for the starters of a game not to play with numbers 1 to 11, from that moment onwards, Cruyff wore number 14, even with the [[Netherlands national football team|Dutch national team]]. There was a documentary on Cruyff, ''Nummer 14 Johan Cruyff''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://imdb.com/title/tt0070462|title=Nummer 14 Johan Cruyff|work=IMDb.com|accessdate= 18 March 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; and in the Netherlands there is a magazine by [[Voetbal International]], ''Nummer 14''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nummer14.nl|title=Nummer 14|work=Nummer14.com|accessdate=18 March 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Quote box|width=32%|align=right|quote=Johan Cruyff's miracles in Amsterdam were many. He and his coach [[Rinus Michels]] (a sort of John the Baptist figure) raised Ajax from obscurity. More important, they invented a new way of playing. Cruyff became the greatest exponent and teacher of 'totaalvoetbal' [Total Football]. His vision of perfect movement and harmony on the field was rooted in the same sublime ordering of space that one sees in the pictures of [[Vermeer]] or church painter [[Pieter Jansz Saenredam]]. It was the music of the spheres on grass.|source=—[[David Winner (author)|David Winner]], the author of ''[[Brilliant Orange: The Neurotic Genius of Dutch Football]]''&lt;ref name="The Guardian"&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2012/apr/29/barcelona-gospel-of-guardiola ""Barcelona and the gospel of Guardiola (29 April 2012)""]. The Guardian; retrieved 12 June 2014&lt;/ref&gt;}}

In a league game against [[AZ Alkmaar|AZ '67]] on 29 November 1970, Cruyff scored six goals in an 8–1 victory. After winning a replayed KNVB Cup final against [[Sparta Rotterdam]] by a score of 2–1, Ajax won in Europe for the first time. On 2 June 1971, in London, Ajax won the European Cup by defeating [[Panathinaikos F.C.|Panathinaikos]] 2–0.&lt;ref name="FIFA Profile"/&gt; He signed a seven-year contract at Ajax. At the end of the season, he was named the Dutch and [[European Footballer of the Year]] for 1971.&lt;ref name="FIFA Profile"/&gt;

In 1972, Ajax won a second European Cup, beating [[Inter Milan]] 2–0 in the final, with Cruyff scoring both goals.&lt;ref name="FIFA Profile"/&gt; This victory prompted Dutch newspapers to announce the demise of the Italian style of defensive football in the face of [[Total Football]]. ''Soccer: The Ultimate Encyclopaedia'' says, "Single-handed, Cruyff not only pulled Internazionale of Italy apart in the 1972 European Cup Final, but scored both goals in Ajax's 2–0 win."&lt;ref name="ifhof"&gt;[http://www.ifhof.com/hof/cruyff.asp "Johan Cruyff – Hall of Fame"]. International Football Hall of Fame. Retrieved 16 May 2014&lt;/ref&gt; Cruyff also scored in the 3–2 victory over [[ADO Den Haag]] in the KNVB Cup final. In the league, Cruyff was the top scorer with 25 goals as Ajax became champions. Ajax won the [[Intercontinental Cup (football)|Intercontinental Cup]], beating Argentina's [[Club Atlético Independiente|Independiente]] 1–1 in the first game followed by 3–0, and then in January 1973, they won the [[European Super Cup]] by beating [[Rangers F.C.|Rangers]] 3–1 away and 3–2 in Amsterdam. Cruyff's only own goal came on 20 August 1972 against [[FC Amsterdam]]. A week later, against [[Go Ahead Eagles]] in a 6–0 win, Cruyff scored four times for Ajax. The [[1972–73 Eredivisie|1972–73 season]] was concluded with another league championship victory and a third successive European Cup with a 1–0 win over [[Juventus F.C.|Juventus]] in the final, with the ''Encyclopedia'' stating Cruyff "inspired one of the greatest 20-minute spells of football ever seen".&lt;ref name="ifhof"/&gt;

[[File:Cruijff met de beker van de derde prijs, Bestanddeelnr 928-0928.jpg|thumb|upright|Cruyff played for [[FC Barcelona|Barcelona]] from 1973–1978]]
In mid-1973, Cruyff was sold to [[FC Barcelona|Barcelona]] for 6 million [[Dutch gulden|guilders]] (approx. US$2&amp;nbsp;million, c. 1973) in a [[World football transfer record|world record transfer fee]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/23903470 "The history of the world transfer record"]. BBC News. Retrieved 1 May 2014&lt;/ref&gt; On 19 August 1973, he played his last match for Ajax where they defeated FC Amsterdam 6–1, the second match of the 1973–74 season.

Cruyff endeared himself to the Barcelona fans when he chose a Catalan name, Jordi, for his son. He helped the club win [[La Liga]] for the first time since 1960, defeating their [[El Clásico|deadliest rivals]] [[Real Madrid C.F.|Real Madrid]] 5–0 at their home of the [[Santiago Bernabéu Stadium|Santiago Bernabéu]]. Thousands of Barcelona fans who watched the match on television poured out of their homes to join in street celebrations.&lt;ref name="Burns"&gt;Jimmy Burns (2011). "Barça: A People's Passion". Bloomsbury Publishing,&lt;/ref&gt; A ''[[New York Times]]'' journalist wrote that Cruyff had done more for the spirit of the [[Catalonia|Catalan]] people in 90 minutes than many politicians in years of struggle.&lt;ref name="Burns"/&gt; Football historian Jimmy Burns stated, "with Cruyff, the team felt they couldn’t lose".&lt;ref name="Burns"/&gt; He gave them speed, flexibility and a sense of themselves.&lt;ref name="Burns"/&gt; In 1974 Cruyff was crowned European Footballer of the Year.&lt;ref name="FIFA Profile"/&gt;

During his time at Barcelona, Cruyff scored one of his most famous goals, "The 'Phantom' Goal".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2mme7xdbTeE |title=Cruyff: A Legend |publisher=YouTube |accessdate= 20 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a game against [[Atlético Madrid]], Cruyff leapt into the air, twisted his body so he was facing away from the goal, and kicked the ball past [[Miguel Reina]] in the Atlético goal with his right heel (the ball was at about neck height and had already travelled wide of the far post). The goal was featured in the documentary ''{{lang|es|En un momento dado}}'', in which fans of Cruyff attempted to recreate that moment. The goal has been dubbed ''{{lang|es|Le but impossible de Cruyff}}'' (Cruyff's impossible goal).&lt;ref&gt;Heinz Duthel. "FC Barcelona-Barça: Futbol Club Barcelona.

He had only agreed because he was a fan of designer [[Daniel Hechter]], who was then president of PSG.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sport-vintage.com/Library/team%20french/PSG/Johan%20Cruyff%20au%20PSG%20%2C%20avec%20Jean%20Pierre%20Dogliani%20et%20Just%20Fontaine%201975.JPG |title=JPG image |accessdate=23 April 2017 |deadurl=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110716121127/http://www.sport-vintage.com/Library/team%20french/PSG/Johan%20Cruyff%20au%20PSG%20%2C%20avec%20Jean%20Pierre%20Dogliani%20et%20Just%20Fontaine%201975.JPG |archivedate=16 July 2011 |df= }}. sport-vintage.com&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://24.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_m68w4idXk21ru2ag8o1_400.jpg JPG image]. tumblr.com; accessed 24 October 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Brief retirement and spells in the United States====
Cruyff nearly retired in 1978. But after losing most of his money in a series of ill-advised investments — including, to the merriment of the Dutch press, a pig farm — that were counseled by a scam artist who had possibly seduced his wife, Cruyff and his family came to the United States.&lt;ref name="SimonKuperFFT"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://sports.vice.com/en_uk/article/johan-cruyff39s-complicated-legacy-uk-translation |author=Schaerlaeckens, Leander |title=Johan Cruyff's Complicated Legacy |publisher=VICE Sports |date=25 March 2016 |accessdate=25 September 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt; As he recalled, "I had lost millions in pig-farming and that was the reason I decided to become a footballer again."&lt;ref name="HeraldScotland"/&gt; Cruyff insisted that his decision to resume his playing career in the United States was pivotal in his career. "It was wrong, a mistake, to quit playing at 31 with the unique talent I possessed", and adding that "Starting from zero in America, many miles away from my past, was one of the best decisions I made. There I learned how to develop my uncontrolled ambitions, to think as a coach and about sponsorship."&lt;ref name="HeraldScotland"/&gt;

At the age of 32, Cruyff signed a lucrative deal with the [[Los Angeles Aztecs]] of the [[North American Soccer League (1968–84)|North American Soccer League]] (NASL).&lt;ref name="FIFA Profile"/&gt; He had previously been rumoured to be joining the [[New York Cosmos (1971–85)|New York Cosmos]] but the deal did not materialize; he played a few exhibition games for the Cosmos. He stayed at the Aztecs for only one season, and was voted [[NASL Most Valuable Player Award|NASL Player of the Year]]. The following season, he moved to play for the [[Washington Diplomats]]. He played the whole 1980 campaign for the Diplomats, even as the team was facing dire financial trouble. In May 1981, Cruyff played as a guest player for Milan in a tournament, but was injured. As a result, he missed the beginning of the 1981 NASL soccer season, which ultimately led to Cruyff choosing to leave the team. Cruyff also loathed playing on artificial surfaces, which were common in the NASL at the time.

====Return to Spain with Levante====
In January 1981, Cruyff played three friendly matches for [[FC Dordrecht]]. Also in January 1981, manager [[Jock Wallace, Jr.|Jock Wallace]] of English club [[Leicester City F.C.|Leicester City]] made an attempt to sign Cruyff, and despite negotiations lasting three weeks, in which Cruyff expressed his desire to play for the club, a deal could not be reached. Cruyff instead chose to sign with Spanish [[Segunda División]] side [[Levante UD|Levante]].&lt;ref name="Just how close were Leicester City to signing Dutch master Johan Cruyff?"&gt;{{cite news|title=Just how close were Leicester City to signing Dutch master Johan Cruyff?|url=http://www.leicestermercury.co.uk/Just-close-Leicester-City-signing-Dutch-master-Johan-Cruyff/story-12048983-detail/story.html|publisher=www.leicestermercury.co.uk|date=23 October 2009|accessdate=27 October 2013|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131029201321/http://www.leicestermercury.co.uk/Just-close-Leicester-City-signing-Dutch-master-Johan-Cruyff/story-12048983-detail/story.html|archivedate=29 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In March 1981, Cruyff took the field for the first time for Levante. Injuries and disagreements with the administration of the club, however, blighted his spell in the Segunda División, and he only made ten appearances, scoring two goals. Having failed to secure promotion to the first division, a contract with Levante fell through.&lt;ref name="Murray"/&gt;

====Second spell at Ajax====
[[File:Johan Cruijff met Japanse fans.jpg|thumb|Johan Cruyff with Japanese fans in 1982]]
After his spell in the U.S. and a short-lived stay in Spain, Cruyff returned to play in his homeland, rejoining Ajax on 30 November 1980 as "technical advisor" to trainer [[Leo Beenhakker]], Ajax being eighth in the league table at the time after 13 games played. After 34 games, however, Ajax finished the [[1980–81 Eredivisie|1980–81 season]] in second. In December 1981, Cruyff signed a contract extension with Ajax.&lt;ref name="Murray"&gt;Scott Murray, Rowan Walker (2008). "Day of the Match: A History of Football in 365 Days". p. 271. Pan Macmillan, 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[1981–82 Eredivisie|1981–82]] and [[1982–83 Eredivisie|1982–83]] seasons, Ajax, along with Cruyff, became league champions. In 1982–83, Ajax won the Dutch Cup (KNVB-Beker). In 1982, he scored a famous goal against [[Helmond Sport]]. While playing for Ajax, Cruyff scored a penalty the same way [[Rik Coppens]] had done it 25 years earlier.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/2005/oct/26/theknowledge.sport|title=Who took the first two-man penalty?|date=26 October 2005|work=The Guardian|accessdate=26 March 2010|location=London, UK|first=James|last=Dart}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sportscene.excite.co.uk/brazilians-recreate-cruyff-penalty-to-show-pires-and-henry-how-its-done-N2328.html|title=Brazilians recreate Cruyff penalty to show Pires and Henry how it's done|publisher=Excite|date=30 March 2008|accessdate=28 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; He put the ball down as for a routine penalty kick, but instead of shooting at goal, Cruyff nudged the ball sideways to teammate [[Jesper Olsen]], who in return passed it back to Cruyff to tap the ball into the empty net, as Otto Versfeld, the Helmond goalkeeper, looked on.&lt;ref name="FIFA Profile"/&gt;

====Final season at Feyenoord and retirement====
At the end of the 1982–83 season, Ajax decided not to offer Cruyff a new contract. This angered Cruyff, who responded by signing for Ajax's archrivals [[Feyenoord]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://cruyff.com/asp/eng/werkenleven.asp?page=speler-fey|title=Playing for Feyenoord|work=Cruyff.com|accessdate=28 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cruyff's season at Feyenoord was a successful one in which the club won the Eredivisie for the first time in a decade, part of a [[1983–84 Eredivisie|league]] and [[1983–84 KNVB Cup|KNVB Cup]] double. The team's success was due to the performances of Cruyff along with [[Ruud Gullit]] and [[Peter Houtman]].&lt;ref name="Dutch title"&gt;Mik Schots (2013). "Feyenoord-Ajax: gezworen vijanden". Singel Uitgeverijen&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite his relatively advanced age, Cruyff played all league matches that season except for one. Because of his performance on the field, he was voted as Dutch Footballer of the Year for the fifth time. At the end of the season, the veteran announced his final retirement. He ended his Eredivisie playing career on 13 May 1984 with a goal against [[PEC Zwolle]]. Cruyff played his last game in Saudi Arabia against [[Al-Ahli SC (Jeddah)|Al-Ahli]], bringing Feyenoord back into the game with a goal and an assist.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://fm.manutd.nl/de-echte-afscheidswedstrijd-van-cruijff|title=De echte afscheidswedstrijd van Cruijff|publisher=Football United|date=20 July 2009|language=Dutch}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{clear}}

===International career===
[[File:Oefeninterland Nederland tegen Argentinië 4-1; nr. 6, 7 Cruyff, kop.jpg|thumb|right|upright|Cruyff as captain of the Netherlands prior to a game at the 1974 World Cup]]
As a Dutch international, Cruyff played 48 [[Cap (sport)|matches]], scoring 33 goals.&lt;ref name="FIFA Profile"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=The total footballer|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sportacademy/hi/sa/football/features/newsid_3301000/3301407.stm|publisher=BBC|accessdate=19 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The national team never lost a match in which Cruyff scored. On 7 September 1966, he made his official debut for the Netherlands in the [[UEFA Euro 1968]] [[UEFA Euro 1968 qualifying|qualifier]] against [[Hungary national football team|Hungary]], scoring in the 2–2 draw. In his second match, a friendly against [[Czechoslovakia national football team|Czechoslovakia]], Cruyff was the first Dutch international to receive a [[Misconduct (football)|red card]]. The [[Royal Dutch Football Association]] (KNVB) banned him from Ajax games but not internationals.&lt;ref&gt;David Winner (2012). "Brilliant Orange: The Neurotic Genius of Dutch Football". A&amp;C Black&lt;/ref&gt;

Accusations of Cruyff's "aloofness" were not rebuffed by his habit of wearing a shirt with only two black stripes along the sleeves, as opposed to [[Adidas]]' usual design feature of three, worn by all the other Dutch players. Cruyff had a separate sponsorship deal with [[Puma SE|Puma]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/2001/may/30/theknowledge.sport | location=London | work=The Guardian | first1=Scott | last1=Murray | first2=Sean | last2=Ingle | title=A tale of strips, stripes and strops | date=30 May 2001}}&lt;/ref&gt; From 1970 onwards, he wore the number 14 jersey for the Netherlands, setting a trend for wearing shirt numbers outside the usual starting line-up numbers of 1 to 11.&lt;ref name="FIFA Profile"/&gt;

====1974 FIFA World Cup====
Cruyff led the Netherlands to a runners-up medal in the [[1974 FIFA World Cup|1974 World Cup]] and was named [[Golden Ball (FIFA)|player of the tournament]].&lt;ref name="FIFA Profile"/&gt; Thanks to his team's mastery of Total Football, they coasted all the way to the final, knocking out [[Argentina national football team|Argentina]] (4–0), [[East Germany national football team|East Germany]] (2–0) and [[Brazil national football team|Brazil]] (2–0) along the way.&lt;ref name="FIFA Profile"/&gt; Cruyff scored twice against Argentina in one of his team's most dominating performances, then he scored the second goal against Brazil to knock out the defending champions.&lt;ref name="FIFA Profile"/&gt;

The Netherlands faced hosts [[Germany national football team|West Germany]] in the final. Cruyff kicked off and the ball was passed around the ''Oranje'' team 15 times before returning to Cruyff, who then went on a run past [[Berti Vogts]] and ended when he was fouled by [[Uli Hoeneß]] inside the box. Teammate [[Johan Neeskens]] scored from the spot kick to give the Netherlands a 1–0 lead and the Germans had not yet touched the ball.&lt;ref name="FIFA Profile"/&gt; During the latter half of the final, his influence was stifled by the effective marking of Vogts, while [[Franz Beckenbauer]], Uli Hoeneß and [[Wolfgang Overath]] dominated the midfield as West Germany came back to win 2–1.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://fifaworldcup.yahoo.com/06/en/p/pwc/1974.html|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070320083442/http://fifaworldcup.yahoo.com/06/en/p/pwc/1974.html|archivedate=20 March 2007|title=Germany 1974|publisher=FIFAWorldCup.yahoo.com|accessdate=28 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In an interview published in the 50th anniversary issue of ''[[World Soccer (magazine)|World Soccer]]'' magazine, the captain of the Brazilian team that won the [[1970 FIFA World Cup|1970 World Cup]], [[Carlos Alberto Torres|Carlos Alberto]], went on to say, "The only team I've seen that did things differently was Holland at the 1974 World Cup in Germany. Since then everything looks more or less the same to me....

With regards to role models, Brazilian football manager and former player [[Telê Santana]] has mentioned in one interview that he had no idols, though, "My greatest satisfaction would be to manage a team such as 1974 Holland. It was a team where you could pick [Johan] Cruyff and place him on the right wing. If I had to put him in the left-wing, he would still play [the same]. I could choose Neeskens, who played both to the right and to the left of the midfield. Thus, everyone played in any position."&lt;ref name="fapesp"&gt;{{cite web|title=Memória Roda Viva (video clip and full written interview to TV Cultura)|url=http://www.rodaviva.fapesp.br/materia/160/entrevistados/tele_santana_1992.htm|accessdate=21 June 2010|date=22 June 1992|publisher=Fapesp|language=Portuguese}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====After 1974====
Cruyff retired from international football in October 1977, having helped the national team qualify for the upcoming World Cup.&lt;ref name="FIFA Profile"/&gt; Without him, the Netherlands finished runners-up in the World Cup again. Initially, the reason given for missing the [[1978 FIFA World Cup|1978 World Cup]] were political reasons given [[National Reorganization Process|a military dictatorship was in power]] in Argentina at that time. In 2008, Cruyff stated to the journalist Antoni Bassas in [[Catalunya Ràdio]] that he and his family were subject to a kidnap attempt in Barcelona a year before the tournament, and that this had caused his retirement. "To play a World Cup you have to be 200% okay, there are moments when there are other values in life."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://football.guardian.co.uk/News_Story/0,,2273925,00.html|work=The Guardian|title=Kidnappers made Cruyff miss World Cup|date=16 April 2008|accessdate=26 March 2010|location=London, UK|first=Paul|last=Doyle}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Coaching career==

===Entry into management with Ajax===
[[File:Training Ajax, Cruijff (r) en algemeen directeur Arie van Eijden tijdens perscon, Bestanddeelnr 934-1215.jpg|thumb|left|Cruyff as manager of Ajax in 1987]]
After retiring from playing, Cruyff followed in the footsteps of his mentor [[Rinus Michels]], coaching a young Ajax side to victory in the [[UEFA Cup Winners' Cup|European Cup Winners' Cup]] in [[1987 European Cup Winners' Cup Final|1987]] (1–0). In May and June 1985, Cruyff returned to Ajax again. In the [[1985–86 Eredivisie|1985–86 season]], the league title was lost to [[Jan Reker]]'s PSV, despite Ajax having a goal difference of +85 (120 goals for, 35 goals against). In the 1985–86 and [[1986–87 Eredivisie|1986–87]] seasons, Ajax won the KNVB Cup.
{{Quote box|width=32%|align=right|quote=If you look at the greatest players in history, most of them couldn’t coach.

FIFA.com; retrieved 10 June 2016&lt;/ref&gt;}}

It was during this period as manager that Cruyff was able to implement his favoured team formation—three mobile [[Defender (association football)|defenders]]; plus one more covering space – becoming, in effect, a [[Midfielder|defensive midfielder]] (from [[Frank Rijkaard|Rijkaard]], [[Danny Blind|Blind]], [[Sonny Silooy|Silooy]], [[Frank Verlaat|Verlaat]], [[Peter Larsson (footballer, born 1961)|Larsson]], [[Ronald Spelbos|Spelbos]]), two "controlling" midfielders (from Rijkaard, [[Arnold Scholten|Scholten]], [[Aron Winter|Winter]], [[Jan Wouters|Wouters]], [[Arnold Mühren|Mühren]], [[Rob Witschge|Witschge]]) with responsibilities to feed the attack-minded players, one [[Forward (association football)|second striker]] ([[John Bosman|Bosman]], Scholten), two touchline-hugging [[Winger (football)|wingers]] (from [[Dennis Bergkamp|Bergkamp]], [[John van't Schip|van't Schip]], [[Rob de Wit (footballer)|De Wit]], [[Richard Witschge|Witschge]]) and one versatile centre forward (from [[Marco van Basten|Van Basten]], [[Henny Meijer|Meijer]], Bosman). So successful was this system that Ajax won the [[1995 UEFA Champions League Final|Champions League in 1995]] playing Cruyff's system – a tribute to Cruyff's legacy as Ajax coach.&lt;ref name="Club legacy"/&gt;

===Return to Barcelona as manager===
[[File:La Masia (Can Planas) (Barcelona) - 1.jpg|thumb|left|Main façade of old [[La Masia]], the name of FC Barcelona's football training facilities and often used to generically describe the Barcelona [[youth academy]]. La Masia academy was the brainchild of Cruyff.]]
After having appeared for the club as a player, Cruyff returned to Barcelona for the [[1988–89 FC Barcelona season|1988–89 season]], this time to take up his new role as coach of the first team. Before returning to Barcelona, however, Cruyff had already built up plenty of experience as a coach/manager. In the Netherlands, he was strongly praised for the attacking flair he imposed on his sides and also for his commendable work as talent spotter, discovering, for example Marco van Basten and Dennis Bergkamp. With Barça, Cruyff started work with a completely remodelled side after the previous season's scandal, known as the "Hesperia Mutiny". His second in command was [[Carles Rexach]], who had already been at the club for a year. Cruyff immediately had his Barça charges playing his attractive brand of football and the results did not take long in coming. But, this did not just happen with the first team, the youth teams also displayed that same attacking style, something that made it easier for reserve players to make the switch to first team football.&lt;ref name="FCB_Cruyff88-96"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.fcbarcelona.com/club/history/card/johan-cruyff-1988-96 |title=FC Barcelona: Johan Cruyff (1988–96) |publisher=FCBarcelona.com |accessdate=9 September 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt; As [[Sid Lowe]] noted, when Cruyff took over as manager, Barcelona of the late 1980s "were a club in debt and in crisis. Results were bad, performances were worse, the atmosphere terrible and attendances down, while even the relationship between the [[President of FC Barcelona|president of the club]] [[Josep Lluís Núñez]] and the [[President of the Generalitat de Catalunya|president of the Spanish autonomous community]] they represented, [[Jordi Pujol]], had deteriorated. It did not work immediately but he [Cruyff] recovered the identity he had embodied as a player. He took risks, and rewards followed."&lt;ref name="SidLowe"/&gt;

At Barça, Cruyff brought in players such as [[Pep Guardiola]], [[José Mari Bakero]], [[Txiki Begiristain]], [[Ion Andoni Goikoetxea|Andoni Goikoetxea]], [[Ronald Koeman]], [[Michael Laudrup]], [[Romário]], [[Gheorghe Hagi]] and [[Hristo Stoichkov]]. With Cruyff, Barça experienced a glorious era. In the space of five years (1989–1994), he led the club to four European finals (two [[European Cup Winners' Cup]] finals and two European Cup/UEFA Champions League finals). Cruyff's track record includes one European Cup, four Liga championships, one Cup Winners' Cup, one Copa del Rey and four Supercopa de España.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.fcbarcelona.com/club/history/card/1988-the-return-of-johan-cruyff |title=FC Barcelona: 1988. The Return of Johan Cruyff, A New Management Model |publisher=FCBarcelona.com |accessdate=9 September 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Under Cruyff, Barça's "[[FC Barcelona#Dream Team|Dream Team]]" won four La Liga titles in a row (1991–1994), and beat [[U.C. Sampdoria|Sampdoria]] in both the [[1989 European Cup Winners' Cup Final|1989 European Cup Winners' Cup final]] and the [[1992 European Cup Final|1992 European Cup final]] at [[Wembley Stadium (1923)|Wembley Stadium]].&lt;ref name="Dream"/&gt;
On 10 May 1989, goals from Salinas and López Rekarte led Barcelona to a 2–0 victory against Sampdoria. Over 25,000 supporters travelled to Switzerland to support the team. Cruyff's new Barça took home the club's third Cup Winners' Cup.
The European Cup dream became a reality on 20 May 1992 at Wembley in London, when Barça beat Sampdoria. Cruyff's last instruction to his players before they stepped onto the pitch was "''Salid y disfrutad''" (Spanish for "Go out and enjoy it" or "Go out there and enjoy yourselves").&lt;ref name="FCB_DreamTeam"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.fcbarcelona.com/club/history/card/1988-1996-the-era-of-the-dream-team |title=FC Barcelona: 1988–1996.

In the 111th minute, Ronald Koeman's brilliant free kick clinched Barça's first European Cup victory. Twenty-five thousand supporters accompanied the team to Wembley, while one million turned out on the streets of Barcelona to welcome the European champions home.&lt;ref name="FCB_DreamTeam"/&gt; Victories under Cruyff include a 5–0 La Liga win over Real Madrid in ''El Clásico'' at the Camp Nou, as well as a 4–0 win against [[Manchester United F.C.|Manchester United]] in the Champions League.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/football/9004492/Strikers-trademark-goals-the-Thierry-Henry-control-and-place-the-Romario-toe-poke-and-more.html "Strikers' trademark goals: the Thierry Henry control-and-place, the Romario toe-poke and more"].

The legacy that Cruyff gave Barcelona, however, was about more than just [[List of FC Barcelona records and statistics|trophies and records]], as he gave Barça a winning mentality and footballing identity/ideology that runs through the club till this day. As Barcelona manager, he laid systemic foundations for a prominent school of football: "Barçajax school" or "Barça-Ajax school", as it has been termed by many. The predominant style of play, now known as ''[[tiki-taka]]'' or ''[[tiqui-taca]]'', had been transferred and improved from Ajax to Barça. It was that which has sustained Barcelona since the days of [[Vic Buckingham]], Rinus Michels and Cruyff (as player) in the early 1970s: they were the ideas of Ajax; Total Football, a predominant belief in [[Ball possession|possession-oriented]] football with an attack-minded [[Formation (association football)#3.E2.80.934.E2.80.933|3–4–3]]/[[formation (association football)#4–3–3|4–3–3]] [[formation (association football)|team formation]], rooted in a high offside line, pressing and the interchange of players on the field. When Cruyff became Barcelona's manager in 1988, he reinforced this footballing philosophy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/2015/dec/22/devil-and-jose-mourinho |author=[[Jonathan Wilson (writer)|Wilson, Jonathan]] |title=The devil and José Mourinho |work=The Guardian |date=22 December 2015 |accessdate=22 July 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt; He was also responsible for introducing "rondos" (a circle of players pass the ball to each other, while one in the centre tries to catch it) into the team's training sessions. About Cruyff's lasting influence on Barça's [[youth academy]] ''[[La Masia]]'', [[Guillem Balagué]] noted, "Cruyff demanded changes at the academy and La Masía began regularly producing the players he wanted as well as providing the kids with a sound education, dual ambitions of the Dutch coach and the club. "The player who has come through La Masía has something different from the rest, it's a plus that only comes from having competed in a Barcelona shirt from the time you were a child", says Guardiola. He is talking not only about the understanding of the game and their ability, but about human qualities. The players who go through La Masía are taught to behave with civility and humility. The theory being that, not only is it pleasant to be unassuming, but also if you are humble, you are capable of learning – and the capacity to learn is the capacity to improve. If you aren't capable of learning you won't improve. Since his arrival, Johan had tried and succeeded in convincing the club to train all the junior teams in the same way as the first eleven – and to favour talent over physique."&lt;ref name="Balagué 2013"&gt;[[Guillem Balagué|Balagué, Guillem]] (2013). ''Pep Guardiola: Another Way of Winning. The Biography'' (Orion Publishing Group, {{ISBN|978-1409129462}})&lt;/ref&gt;

Cruyff used to smoke 20 [[cigarette]]s a day prior to undergoing double heart bypass surgery in 1991 while he was the coach of Barcelona, after which he gave up smoking. He also led the anti-smoking campaign developed by the Health Department of the Catalan autonomous government. Cruyff juggled a cigarette pack 16 times in an anti-tobacco video sponsored by the Catalan Department of Health.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Global Art of Soccer|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=H2T0ZD5S86QC|date=2006|publisher=CusiBoy Publishing|isbn=978-0-9776688-0-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

With 11 trophies, Cruyff was Barcelona's most successful manager, but has since been surpassed by his former player Pep Guardiola, who achieved 15. Cruyff was also the club's longest-serving manager. In his final two seasons, however, he failed to win any trophies, falling-out with chairman Josep Lluís Núñez, who ultimately sacked him as Barcelona coach.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fourfourtwo.com/features/how-johan-cruyff-reinvented-modern-football-barcelona#CPGeYMEFgHwelzsP.99 "How Johan Cruyff reinvented modern football at Barcelona"], ''FourFourTwo.com''; retrieved 24 October 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;

While still at Barcelona, Cruyff was in negotiations with the KNVB to manage the national team for the [[1994 FIFA World Cup|1994 World Cup]] finals, but talks broke off at the last minute.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://fifaworldcup.yahoo.com/06/en/p/cp/ned/cruyff.html |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070314235850/http://fifaworldcup.yahoo.com/06/en/p/cp/ned/cruyff.html |archivedate=14 March 2007 |title=Profile on FIFAWorldCup.yahoo.com |accessdate=28 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Catalonia national team===
[[File:Cruyff Catalunya 2013.jpg|thumb|Cruyff with the [[Catalonia national football team|Catalonia national team]] in January 2013]]

As well as representing Catalonia on the pitch in 1976, Cruyff also managed the [[Catalonia national football team|Catalonia national team]] from 2009 to 2013, leading the team to a victory over [[Argentina national football team|Argentina]] in his debut match.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.punditarena.com/football/european-football/ehallissey/catalonia-greatest-team-youve-never-seen/ |author=Hallissey, Eoin |title=Catalonia – The Greatest Team You've Never Seen |publisher=Pundit Arena |date=29 July 2014 |accessdate=29 July 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 2 November 2009, Cruyff was named as manager of the Catalonia national team. It was his first managing job for 13 years.&lt;ref name="BBC_2009-11-02"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/football/8338289.stm|title=Cruyff will coach Catalonia team|publisher=BBC Sport|date=2 November 2009|accessdate=28 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 22 December 2009, they played a friendly game against Argentina, which ended in a Catalonia win, 4–2 at Camp Nou.

==Other football-related activities==

===As a technical advisor===

====Unofficial advisor to Barcelona president Joan Laporta====
{{quote|I chose Frank Rijkaard, [[Txiki Begiristain]] and Pep Guardiola because Johan told me to.|Joan Laporta, in an interview (March 2017)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://en.as.com/en/2017/03/16/football/1489668098_953494.html |title=Laporta: Next Barcelona coach must follow Cruyff's philosophy |publisher=[[Diario AS|AS.com]] |date=16 March 2017 |accessdate=26 May 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Later in his reign as Barcelona manager, Cruyff suffered a heart attack and was advised to quit coaching by his doctors. He left in 1996, and never took another top job, but his influence did not end there. Though he vowed never to coach again, he remained a vocal football critic and analyst. Cruyff's open support helped candidate [[Joan Laporta]] to victory in Barcelona's presidential elections. He continued to be an adviser for him, although he held no official post at Barcelona.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.goal.com/en/news/1717/editorial/2011/11/26/2774421/jose-mourinho-at-barcelona-how-the-real-madrid-coach-almost |publisher=Goal.com |author=Hayward, Ben |title=Jose Mourinho at Barcelona – how the Real Madrid coach almost ended up back at Camp Nou |date=26 November 2011 |accessdate=26 July 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thesundaytimes.co.uk/sto/sport/football/article1682001.ece |author=Hawkey, Ian |title=Cruyff: Visionary who showed us Spain's got talent |publisher=The Sunday Times (thesundaytimes.co.uk) |quote=As Joan Laporta, the president of Barcelona who appointed Rijkaard and Guardiola, recalled: "It was Johan who recommended Frank as coach and who told me that Pep was ready to manage the first team." Cruyff did not need to be on Barcelona's payroll to shape the fortunes of the club. |date=27 March 2016 |accessdate=27 July 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Back in an advisory capacity alongside Joan Laporta, he recommended the appointment of Frank Rijkaard in 2003. Again Barca was successful, winning back-to-back league titles and another Champions League crown in 2006.

After two relatively disappointing campaigns, Laporta survived a censure motion and an overhaul was needed. In summer 2008, Rijkaard left the club and even though [[José Mourinho]] was pushing for the job at Camp Nou, Cruyff chose Pep Guardiola. Many were quick to point to Guardiola's lack of coaching experience, but Cruyff said, "The biggest test for a coach at a team like Barça is the strength to make decisions and the ability to talk to the press, because they don't help and you have to manage that. After that, it's easy for those who know football. But there aren't many who know."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.goal.com/en-us/news/1956/europe/2016/03/24/21659412/how-cruyff-changed-the-modern-game |author=Hayward, Ben |title=How Cruyff changed the modern game |publisher=Goal.com |date=24 March 2016 |accessdate=24 July 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 26 March 2010, Cruyff was named honorary president of Barcelona in recognition of his contributions to the club as both a player and manager.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fcbarcelona.com/web/english/noticies/club/temporada09-10/03/26/n100326110082.html|archive-url=https://archive.is/20120730165648/http://www.fcbarcelona.com/web/english/noticies/club/temporada09-10/03/26/n100326110082.html|dead-url=yes|archive-date=30 July 2012|title=Johan Cruyff named Honorary President|publisher=FC Barcelona|accessdate=26 March 2007|date=26 March 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; In July 2010, however, he was stripped of this title by new president [[Sandro Rosell]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://soccernet.espn.go.com/news/story?id=807580&amp;sec=europe&amp;cc=5739|title=Cruyff unimpressed by Barça 'circus'|publisher=[[ESPN]]|date=10 July 2010|accessdate=11 July 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/2010/jul/02/johan-cruyff-barcelona-president|title=Johan Cruyff stripped of Barcelona honorary president title|work=[[The Guardian]]|date=10 July 2010|accessdate=11 July 2010|location=London, UK}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Return to Ajax as technical director====
On 20 February 2008, in the wake of a major research on the ten-year-mismanagement, it was announced that Cruyff would be the new [[Director of football|technical director]] at his boyhood club Ajax, his fourth stint with the Amsterdam club.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url = http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/sport/football/european_football/article3406177.ece|title=Johan Cruyff answers distress call from the club where legend was created|accessdate=29 February 2008|date=21 February 2008|work=The Times|first=Kaveh|last=Solhekol|location=London, UK}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cruyff announced in March that he was pulling out of his planned return to Ajax because of "professional difference of opinion" between him and Ajax's new manager, Marco van Basten.

==Style of play and views on the game==

===''The total footballer''===
[[File:Johan Cruijff (Ajax) scoort.jpg|thumb|left|Cruyff playing with Ajax in 1971. In modern football, Cruyff was one of the brilliant pioneers of the "[[false 9]]" position.&lt;ref name="ASRoma.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.asroma.com/en/news/2016/3/cruyff-liedholm-s-roma-and-total-football |author=Riccardi, Tiziano |title=Cruyff, Liedholm's Roma and total football |publisher=AS Roma Official Website (www.asroma.com) |quote=[[Luciano Spalletti]]: "Nowadays, we like to play around with the idea of the false nine.

Throughout his career, Cruyff became synonymous with the playing style of "Total Football".&lt;ref name="hall of fame"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ifhof.com/hof/cruyff.asp|title=Johan Cruyff -International Hall of Fame|work=ifhof.com|accessdate=9 April 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sportacademy/hi/sa/football/features/newsid_3301000/3301407.stm|title=Johan Cruyff: The Total Footballer|work=Sport Academy|publisher=British Broadcasting Corporation|accessdate=13 June 2008|date=10 December 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Wilson"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2013/may/22/great-european-cup-teams-ajax|title=''The great European Cup teams: Ajax 1971–73''|work=The Guardian|last=Wilson|first=Jonathan|date=22 May 2013|accessdate=12 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is a system where a player who moves out of his position is replaced by another from his team, thus allowing the team to retain their intended organizational structure. In this fluid system, no footballer is fixed in their intended outfield role. The style was honed by Ajax coach Rinus Michels, with Cruyff serving as the on-field "conductor".&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/football/2000/dec/15/sport.comment "Cruyff the conductor edges the successful solo artists"], ''The Guardian'; retrieved 3 December 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://articles.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/2009-11-21/top-stories/28111935_1_pele-world-cup-caps "They had the world at their feet"], timesofindia.indiatimes.com, 21 November 2009; retrieved 3 December 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; Space and the creation of it were central to the concept of Total Football. Ajax defender [[Barry Hulshoff]], who played with Cruyff, explained how the team that won the European Cup in 1971, 1972 and 1973 worked it to their advantage: "We discussed space the whole time. Cruyff always talked about where people should run, where they should stand, where they should not be moving. It was all about making space and coming into space. It is a kind of architecture on the field. We always talked about speed of ball, space and time. Where is the most space? Where is the player who has the most time? That is where we have to play the ball. Every player had to understand the whole geometry of the whole pitch and the system as a whole."&lt;ref name="DWinner_BrilliantOrange"&gt;[[David Winner (author)|Winner, David]] (2001). ''[[Brilliant Orange: The Neurotic Genius of Dutch Football]]''. (Bloomsbury Publishing, {{ISBN|978-0747553106}})&lt;/ref&gt;

The team orchestrator, Cruyff was a creative [[playmaker]] with a gift for timing passes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.fifa.com/classicfootball/players/player=1043/index.html |title=Johan Cruyff |work=Fifa.com |accessdate=29 September 2001}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nominally, he played centre-forward in this system and was a prolific goalscorer, but dropped deep to confuse his markers or moved to the wing to great effect.&lt;ref name="Turn"/&gt; In the [[1974 FIFA World Cup Final|1974 World Cup final]] between West Germany and the Netherlands, from the kick-off, the Dutch monopolised [[ball possession]]. At the start of the move that led to the opening goal, Cruyff picked up the ball in his own half. The Dutch captain, who was nominally a centre-forward, was the deepest Dutch outfield player, and after a series of passes, he set off on a run from the centre circle into the West German box. Unable to stop Cruyff by fair means, [[Uli Hoeness]] brought Cruyff down, conceding a penalty scored by [[Johan Neeskens]]. The first German to thus touch the ball was goalkeeper [[Sepp Maier]] picking the ball out of his own net.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= https://uk.sports.yahoo.com/news/johan-cruyff-s-total-football-origins-can-be-traced-back-to-grimsby--burnley-and-west-brom-145722112.html |author=Powley, Adam |title=Johan Cruyff's Total Football origins can be traced back to Grimsby, Burnley and West Brom |publisher=Yahoo Sport |date=25 March 2016 |accessdate=25 July 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Due to the way Cruyff played the game, he is still referred to as "the total footballer".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sportacademy/hi/sa/football/features/newsid_3301000/3301407.stm|title=The total footballer|publisher=BBC Sport|accessdate=23 March 2007|date=10 December 2003|location=London, UK}}&lt;/ref&gt; Former French player [[Eric Cantona]] states, "I loved the Dutch in the '70s, they excited me and Cruyff was the best. He was at the heart of a revolution with his football. Ajax changed football and he was the leader of it all. If he wanted he could be the best player in any position on the pitch."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fourfourtwo.com/features/eric-cantonas-perfect-xi-who-broke-kings-heart" Eric Cantona: Perfect XI (1 April 2006)""].

Cruyff was known for his technical ability, speed, acceleration, [[Dribbling#Association football|dribbling]] and vision, possessing an awareness of his teammates' positions as an attack unfolded. Despite his relatively unimpressive stature and strength, Cruyff's tactical brain and reading of the game were exceptional. "Football consists of different elements: technique, tactics and stamina", he told the journalists Henk van Dorp and Frits Barend, in one of the interviews collected in their book ''Ajax, Barcelona, Cruyff''. "There are some people who might have better technique than me, and some may be fitter than me, but the main thing is tactics. With most players, tactics are missing. You can divide tactics into insight, trust and daring. In the tactical area, I think I just have more than most other players." On the concept of technique in football, Cruyff once said: "Technique is not being able to juggle a ball 1,000 times. Anyone can do that by practising. Then you can work in the circus. Technique is passing the ball with one touch, with the right speed, at the right foot of your team mate."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eurosport.co.uk/football/johan-cruyff-s-best-quotes-the-game-changing-wisdom-of-a-true-football-legend_sto5366190/story.shtml |author=Keel, Toby |title=Johan Cruyff's best quotes: The game-changing wisdom of a true football legend |publisher=Eurosport.co.uk |date=24 March 2016 |accessdate=24 August 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt; As [[Van Basten]] noted, "Johan is so technically perfect that even as a boy he stopped being interested in that aspect of the game. He could do everything when he was 20. That's why he's been very interested in tactics since he was very young. He sees football situations so clearly that he was always the one to decide how the game should be played."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.arsenalnewsreview.co.uk/the-massive-oranje-i/ |author=Palmer, Myles |title=The massive Oranje influence of Johan Cruyff |publisher=Arsenal News Review (arsenalnewsreview.co.uk) |date=11 July 2010 |accessdate=31 August 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1997, Dutch journalist Hubert Smeets wrote, "Cruyff was the first player who understood that he was an artist, and the first who was able and willing to collectivise the art of sports."&lt;ref name="Wilson"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Wilson, Jonathan (2010). ''Inverting The Pyramid: The History Of Football Tactics''&lt;/ref&gt; Sports writer David Miller believed that Cruyff was superior to any previous player in his ability to extract the most from others. He dubbed him "[[Pythagoras]] in boots" for the complexity and precision of his passes and wrote, "Few have been able to exact, both physically and mentally, such mesmeric control on a match from one penalty area to another."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.footballingworld.com/1/flashback/index.php?subaction=showfull&amp;id=1089748748&amp;archive=&amp;start_from=&amp;ucat=96&amp;|title=The Ever-Controversial Revolutionary|work=FootballingWorld.com|accessdate=24 March 2007|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070919012943/http://www.footballingworld.com/1/flashback/index.php?subaction=showfull&amp;id=1089748748&amp;archive=&amp;start_from=&amp;ucat=96&amp;|archivedate=19 September 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to [[England national football team|England]]'s [[1966 FIFA World Cup|1966 World Cup]]-winning striker [[Bobby Charlton]], "He [Cruyff] was pretty intelligent, too! A real football brain. He had superb control, he was inventive and he could perform magic with a ball to get himself out of trouble instinctively. He got a lot of goals, and although he was so skilful, he didn't show off – he played to the strengths of the players around him. This side would really keep hold of the ball."&lt;ref name="FourFourTwo"&gt;[http://www.fourfourtwo.com/features/bobby-charlton-perfect-xi "Bobby Charlton: Perfect XI (1 March 2007)"].

===Importance of style and identity as cultural values in football===
{{quote|Winning is an important thing, but to have your own style, to have people copy you, to admire you, that is the greatest gift.|Johan Cruyff&lt;ref name="JonathanWilson"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eurosport.co.uk/football/johan-cruyff-s-legacy-the-whole-of-modern-football_sto5368491/story.shtml |author=[[Jonathan Wilson (writer)|Wilson, Jonathan]] |title=Johan Cruyff's legacy?

Cruyff always considered aesthetic and moral aspects of the game; it is not just about winning, but about winning with "right" style/way. He also always spoke highly of entertaining value of the game. The [[beautiful game]], for him, is about as much the entertainment and joy as the results. In thinking of Cruyff, the victory is truly meaningful when it can fully capture the minds and hearts of competitors and spectators. As he once noted, "Quality without results is pointless. Results without quality is boring,".&lt;ref name="MessionTwitter"/&gt; For Cruyff and the ''Cruyffistas'' (Cruyff's devout followers), to choose a "right" style of play to win is even more important than winning itself.&lt;ref&gt;In Cruyff's words, quoted in [[David Winner (author)|David Winner]]'s book ''[[Brilliant Orange: The Neurotic Genius of Dutch Football|Brilliant Orange]]'': "There is no medal better than being acclaimed for your style. As a coach, my teams might have won more games if we’d played in a less adventurous way. Maybe I’d have earned a little more and the bonuses would have been bigger, but if people say that Barcelona were playing the nicest football in the world with me as coach, what more can I ask for? If you’re appearing in the World Cup final it may be the biggest occasion of your life, so why be sad and fearful? Be happy, express yourself and play. Make it special for you and for everyone watching. For the good of football, we need a team of invention, attacking ideas and style to emerge. Even if it doesn't win, it will inspire footballers of all ages everywhere. That is the greatest reward."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Cruyff'sChurch"/&gt; Cruyff always believed in [[simplicity]]. He sees simplicity and [[beauty]] as inseparable. "Simple football is the most beautiful. But playing simple football is the hardest thing", as Cruyff once summed up his fundamental philosophy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.irishtimes.com/sport/soccer/ken-early-johan-cruyff-the-great-idealist-who-proved-beauty-is-best-1.2586280 |author=Early, Ken |title=Johan Cruyff the great idealist who proved beauty is best |publisher=The Irish Times |date=24 March 2016 |accessdate=24 July 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt; "How often do you see a pass of forty meters when twenty meters is enough?... To play well, you need good players, but a good player almost always has the problem of a lack of efficiency. He always wants to do things prettier than strictly necessary."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.football365.com/news/portrait-of-an-icon-johan-cruyff |author=Storey, Daniel |title=Portrait of an icon: Johan Cruyff |publisher=Football365.com |date=17 February 2016 |accessdate=27 July 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Cruyff also perfected a [[Dummy (football)#Association football|feint]] now known as the "[[Cruyff Turn]]".&lt;ref name="Turn"&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2014/jun/11/world-cup-stunning-moments-johan-cruyff-turn-1974 "World Cup: 25 stunning moments … No25: the Cruyff Turn is born in 1974"]. ''The Guardian''. Retrieved 11 June 2014&lt;/ref&gt; The feint is an example of the simplicity in Cruyff's football philosophy. It was neither carried out to embarrass the opponent nor to excite the watching crowd, but because Cruyff estimated that it was the simplest method (in terms of effort and risk versus expected result) to beat his opponent. Cruyff looked to pass or cross the ball, then, instead of kicking it, he dragged the ball behind his planted foot with the inside of his other foot, turned through 180 degrees, and accelerated away.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tntmagazine.com/sports/archive/2010/06/04/top-world-cup-moments-no8-the-cruyff-turn-makes-it-debut-1974.aspx Top World Cup moments No8 – The Cruyff turn makes its debut (1974)], tntmagazine.com; accessed 24 October 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; As Swedish defender [[Jan Olsson (footballer, born 1942)|Jan Olsson]] (a "victim" of the Cruyff Turn at the 1974 World Cup) recalled, "I played 18 years in top football and seventeen times for Sweden but that moment against Cruyff was the proudest moment of my career.

Like Dutch football in general until the mid-1960s, Cruyff's early playing career was considerably influenced by coaching philosophy of British/English coaches such as [[Vic Buckingham]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thesefootballtimes.co/2016/01/28/rinus-michels-and-the-total-football-rebellion/ |author=Townsend, Jon |title=Rinus Michels and the Total Football rebellion |work=These Football Times |date=28 January 2016 |accessdate=28 July 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.outside90.com/johan-cruyff-ajax-and-the-english-connection-the-reciprocal-relationship-between-dutch-and-english-football322/ |author=Votoupal, David |title=Johan Cruyff, Ajax and the English football connection |publisher=Outside90.com |date=30 March 2016 |accessdate=30 July 2016 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161022214414/http://outside90.com/johan-cruyff-ajax-and-the-english-connection-the-reciprocal-relationship-between-dutch-and-english-football322/ |archivedate=22 October 2016  }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, his footballing philosophy shares more similar aspects to free-flowing style of [[Creole football|South American football]] ([[Brazilian football]] in particular)&lt;ref&gt;Cruyff, Johan (October 2016). ''My Turn: The Autobiography'' (Pan Macmillan, {{ISBN|9781509813902}}). Johan Cruyff: "I've always admired the Brazilian coach [[Telê Santana]] for his vision, because it always displayed a genuine love of football."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Like Cruyff, former Brazil international captain [[Sócrates]], a strong proponent of the school of entertaining football, said in his book ''Football Philosophy'': "Beauty comes first. Victory is secondary. What matters is joy.".&lt;/ref&gt; than traditional British/Anglo-Saxon school of football (with distinctively direct, aggressive, heavily athletic, muscular, physical elements in coaching and playing style).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Pratt, Jennifer C. |title=The Role of Non-Professional Soccer Clubs and Leagues on Latin American Immigrants in the United States |version= |publisher=Florida State University |quote=One of the most apparent differences between British and local players [South Americans] were their playing styles.

The effect of this encounter with Total Football on Argentinian and Brazilian football was significant: in Argentina, [[César Luis Menotti]], who became coach of the national team after the 1974 World Cup exit, sought to combine the traditional Argentine passing game with a faster tempo of play, emphasising relatively small but hard-working players like [[Osvaldo Ardiles]] in leading the national team to victory on home soil in the 1978 World Cup. Whilst Brazil attempted to implement a Total Football philosophy without success in 1978 under coach [[Cláudio Coutinho]] before reverting to their traditional style in 1982, Brazilian coaches eventually came to believe that they needed to catch up to the Europeans in terms of their physical development, with the gap in physical size being closed by the turn of the millennium: the nature of Brazil's passing game also changed, coming to emphasise quick counter-attacks down the flanks rather than long passing sequences.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/blogs/timvickery/2010/07/netherlands_v_brazil_1974.html |title=When the Dutch led the way |last=Vickery |first=Tim|author-link=Tim Vickery |date=1 July 2010|website=[[bbc.co.uk]]|access-date=2 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The mind-body duality always plays an important role in his footballing philosophy. In Cruyff's words, quoted in [[Dennis Bergkamp]]'s autobiography ''Stillness and Speed: My Story'', "...Because you play football with your head, and your legs are there to help you. If you don't use your head, using your feet won't be sufficient. Why does a player have to chase the ball? Because he started running too late. You have to pay attention, use your brain and find the right position. If you get to the ball late, it means you chose the wrong position. Bergkamp was never late."&lt;ref&gt;Bergkamp, Dennis; Winner, David (2013). ''Stillness and Speed: My Story''. (Simon &amp; Schuster UK Ltd, {{ISBN|978-1471129537}}&lt;/ref&gt; For Cruyff, football (the so-called [[beautiful game]]) is much an artistic-oriented mind-body game instead of an athletic-oriented physical competition. As he put it, "Every trainer talks about movement, about running a lot. I say don't run so much. Football is a game you play with your brain. You have to be in the right place at the right moment, not too early, not too late."&lt;ref name="DWinner_BrilliantOrange"/&gt; The creativity is always the key element in his footballing philosophy, both as a player and as a manager. Cruyff once compared his more intuitive and individualistic approach with Louis van Gaal's more mechanized and rigid coaching style, "Van Gaal has a good vision on football. But it's not mine. He wants to gel winning teams and has a militaristic way of working with his tactics. I don't. I want individuals to think for themselves and take the decision on the pitch that is best for the situation... I don't have anything against computers, but you judge football players intuitively and with your heart. On the basis of the criteria which are now in use at Ajax [recommended by Van Gaal] I would have failed the test. When I was 15, I could barely kick the ball 15 metres with my left and with the right maybe 20 metres. I would not have been able to take a corner. Besides, I was physically weak and relatively slow. My two qualities were great technique and insight, which happen to be two things you can’t measure with a computer."&lt;ref&gt;Meijer, Maarten (2014). ''Louis van Gaal: The Biography''. (Ebury Press, {{ISBN|9780091960155}}), p. 264-265&lt;/ref&gt;

===Cruyff's favourite world XI===
In his posthumously released autobiography ''My Turn: The Autobiography'',&lt;ref name="CruyffAutobio"/&gt; Cruyff reveals his dream all-time XI in his favourite 3-4-3/4–3–3 formation. Cruyff's side (in the 3–4–3 diamond formation) reads as follows: [[Lev Yashin]] (goalkeeper); [[Ruud Krol]] ([[Full back (association football)|full back]]/[[wing-back (association football)|wing-back]]), Franz Beckenbauer ([[central defender]]/[[libero (football)|libero]]), [[Carlos Alberto Torres|Carlos Alberto]] (full-back/wing-back); Pep Guardiola ([[holding midfielder]]/midfield anchor), [[Bobby Charlton]], [[Alfredo Di Stéfano]], [[Diego Maradona]] ([[playmaker]]/[[attacking midfielder]]/[[second striker]]); [[Piet Keizer]] ([[Winger (association football)|winger]]), [[Garrincha]] (winger), and Pelé ([[centre-forward]]/striker). For humility, Cruyff didn't put himself in there, but there is a spot for his pupil, Pep Guardiola and his former teammates, Ruud Krol and Piet Keizer. It's a typically attacking line-up but Cruyff explains the selection in detail. "For the ideal squad, I also try and find a formula in which talent is used to the maximum in every case", notes Cruyff. "The qualities of one player have to complement the qualities of another."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sport-english.com/en/news/barca/johan-cruyffs-all-time-revealed-his-autobiography-5455333 |author=Blasco, Esther |title=Johan Cruyff's all-time XI is revealed in his autobiography |publisher=SPORT.es |date=5 October 2016 |accessdate=7 October 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.skysports.com/football/news/11096/10607132/johan-cruyff-picks-all-time-world-xi-pep-guardiola-makes-the-team |author1=Bate, Adam |author2=Yearwood, Leon |title=Johan Cruyff picks all-time world XI: Pep Guardiola makes the team |publisher=SkySports.com |date=6 October 2016 |accessdate=8 October 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===The 14 rules of Johan Cruyff===
In his autobiography, Cruyff explained why he made a set of 14 basic rules, which are displayed at every Cruyff Court in the world, "I read an article once about the building of the [[pyramids]] in Egypt. It turns out that some of the numbers coincide completely with natural laws – the position of the moon at certain times and so on. And it makes you think: how is it possible that those ancient people built something so scientifically complex? They must have had something that we don't, even though we always think that we're a lot more advanced than they were. Take [[Rembrandt]] and [[van Gogh]]: who can match them today? When I think that way, I'm increasingly convinced that everything is actually possible. If they managed to do the impossible nearly five thousand years ago, why can't we do it today? That applies equally to football, but also to something like the Cruyff Courts and school sports grounds. My fourteen rules are set out for every court and every school sports ground to follow. They are there to teach young people that sports and games can also be translated into everyday life."&lt;ref name="CruyffAutobio"/&gt;

And he listed his 14 basic rules that include:
# Team player – 'To accomplish things, you have to do them together.';
# Responsibility – 'Take care of things as if they were your own.';
# Respect – 'Respect one another.';
# Integration – 'Involve others in your activities.';
# Initiative – 'Dare to try something new.';
# Coaching – 'Always help each other within a team.';
# Personality – 'Be yourself.';
# Social involvement – 'Interaction is crucial, both in sport and in life.';
# Technique – 'Know the basics.';
# Tactics – 'Know what to do.';
# Development – 'Sport strengthens body and soul.';
# Learning – 'Try to learn something new every day.';
# Play together – 'An essential part of any game.';
# Creativity – 'Bring beauty to the sport.'&lt;ref name="CruyffAutobio"/&gt;

As a player with Ajax, Barcelona and the Netherlands, he put himself in the pantheon along with greats such as Pelé, Diego Maradona, [[Ferenc Puskás]], [[Lionel Messi]] and [[Zinedine Zidane]]. As coach at Ajax and Barcelona, he built thrilling sides, nurtured a remarkable number of genius players and influenced many of the most important teams in the world. The all-conquering Spain and Barcelona of [[Xavi]] and [[Andrés Iniesta]], brilliant [[FC Bayern Munich|Bayern Munich]] and Germany of today, AC Milan of the late 1980s and many other memorable champions would have been unthinkable without Cruyff. Once radical and revolutionary, Cruyffian principles have become standard throughout the modern game. His blueprint for developing young players has been copied all over the world."&lt;ref name="DWinner_Cruyff'sChurch"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://thelab.bleacherreport.com/the-church-of-cruyff/ |author=[[David Winner (author)|Winner, David]] |title=The Church of Cruyff: Forever Spreading the Football Gospel |publisher=Bleacher Report Media Lab |date=8 March 2016 |accessdate=18 June 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Gabriele Marcotti]] summed up Cruyff's footballing greatness: "There may have been better players in the history of the game, though I doubt you can count them on more than one hand. And there may have been better managers, too, if only because his coaching career only lasted 10 and a half years (during which he won 14 trophies, not a bad return). But it's tough to argue that any man has exerted a greater influence – on the pitch and on the bench – on the game as we know it today."&lt;ref name="Gabriele Marcotti"/&gt;

Cruyff was the most famous exponent of the school of football known as ''[[Total Football]]'' (''Totaalvoetbal'' in Dutch) explored by Rinus Michels. Being known as "the total footballer", he was also one of the brilliant pioneers of the "[[false nine]]" position/role in modern football.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.worldsoccer.com/blogs/in-search-of-johan-cruijff-338140|author=Rainbow, Jamie |title=In Search Of Johan Cruijff… |publisher=WorldSoccer|date=25 November 2012 |accessdate=25 September 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sportskeeda.com/football/johan-cruyff-making-generations-football-ajax-barcelona-netherlands |author=Sindhu, Anand |title=Johan Cruyff: The making of generations in football |publisher=Sportskeeda.com |date=22 February 2014 |accessdate=22 September 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.onefootball.com/magazine/false-nine-explained/ |author=Nobles, Kevin |title=The False Nine Explained |work=The Onefootball Magazine |date=2 March 2016 |accessdate=22 September 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ASRoma.com"/&gt; In Total Football's heyday (in the early 1970s), Cruyff was truly an ‘on-field tactician’, an ‘on-field manager’,&lt;ref name="SimonKuperFFT"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fourfourtwo.com/features/johan-cruyff-icon |author=[[Simon Kuper|Kuper, Simon]] |title=Johan Cruyff: The player, the coach, the legacy.

As Argentinian World Cup winner [[Jorge Valdano]] said of Cruyff, in an interview with Thomas Goubin of ''SoFoot.com'',

{{quote|Never in my life have I seen a player like Cruyff rule matches. He was the owner of the show. Much more than his team, the referee or the fans.

Chris McMullan (of ''FootballFanCast.com'') writes that "he [Cruyff] was an anomaly. A man who played football like no one else. He didn't physically play football after all, he played it with his mind. An esoteric pursuit that completely changed the game. A visionary, a departure, a flight of fancy – Cruyff is the ultimate because his contribution to the game wasn't simply personal. He didn't break records, he didn't win golden boots, and only occasionally dazzled with skills. The reason he is a great is because he understood the game like no one else ever did and probably ever will. (...) His vision, his ability to see the game in a way that no one else could have was his gift. It showcases his talent, the way he formulated the game in his head and then was able to execute it perfectly with his legs." And he concludes, "There is no one goal, no one clip of football that can encapsulate Johan Cruyff's contribution to football. No one piece of video could ever do that. That's not surprising. Cruyff wasn't a Pele or a Maradona whose careers can be summed up with a series of vines and clips, mountains of goals and skills after another. With Cruyff, you have to think in order to be able to understand it. It doesn't simply happen before your eyes, but it's something altogether more thoughtful, and ultimately more rewarding."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.footballfancast.com/football-blogs/golden-goal-football-will-never-be-the-same-without-johan-cruyff |author=McMullan, Chris |title=Golden Goal – football will never be the same without Johan Cruyff |publisher=FootballFanCast.com |date=24 March 2016 |accessdate=24 September 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

One of very few players who actually have a dribbling move named after them, Cruyff also perfected and popularized a feint now known as the ''Cruyff Turn'' (or ''Cruijff Turn''). With its simplicity, effectiveness and unpredictability, the Cruyff Turn remains one of the most commonly used dribbling moves in modern football.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/football/article-3511889/Harry-Kane-Cruyff-turn-against-Germany-great-feeling-one-won-t-forget.html |author=Prescott, Daniel |title=Harry Kane: 'Cruyff turn against Germany was a great feeling and one I won’t forget' |publisher=Dailymail.co.uk |date=27 March 2016 |accessdate=27 July 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.standard.co.uk/sport/football/euro2016/euro-2016-wales-striker-hal-robsonkanu-on-that-cruyff-turn-and-the-years-he-spent-perfecting-a3289326.html |author=Majendie, Matt |title=Euro 2016: Wales striker Hal Robson-Kanu on that Cruyff turn and the years he spent perfecting technique |publisher=Standard.co.uk |date=6 July 2016 |accessdate=6 August 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt; He was the first player to win the Ballon d'Or three times, in 1971, 1973 and 1974. His world record move from Ajax to Barcelona in 1973 made him the first player to cost more than two million US dollars.

In 1999, Cruyff was voted European Player of the Century in an election held by the [[International Federation of Football History &amp; Statistics]] ([[IFFHS]]), and came second behind Pelé in their [[FIFA Player of the Century#Vote specialists (IFFHS)|World Player of the Century]] poll. He came third in a vote organised by the French magazine ''[[France Football]]'' consulting their former Ballon d'Or winners to elect their Football Player of the Century. He was elected the third-best footballer of the 20th century in a poll by the ''[[World Soccer magazine|World Soccer]]'' magazine. Cruyff was also chosen on the [[World Team of the 20th Century]] in 1998, the [[FIFA World Cup Dream Team]] in 2002, and in 2004 was named in the [[FIFA 100]] list of the world's greatest living players.

In an interview in 2011, when Argentina's 1978 World Cup-winning coach [[César Luis Menotti]] was discussing Lionel Messi's place in the pantheon of footballing greatness, he mentioned Cruyff in the same breath as Pelé and Maradona: "There have been four kings of football – [[Alfredo Di Stéfano|Di Stéfano]], Pelé, Cruyff and Maradona – and the fifth has not yet appeared.

Cruyff the coach, Cruyff the manager, was able to retain that sense of the joy of the game, the importance of beauty and, what's harder, to convey that sense to his players. There has never been such a great player who was also such a great manager.

As the manager of AFC Ajax, Cruyff was able to implement his favoured team formation (3–4–3): with three mobile defenders; plus one more covering space – becoming, in effect, a defensive midfielder, two "controlling" midfielders with responsibilities to feed the attack-minded players, one second striker, two touchline-hugging wingers and one versatile centre forward. So successful was this system that Ajax won the Champions League in 1995 playing Cruyff's system. The starting point of his system was always the [[Total Football]] doctrine of dominating the game with ball possession. When [[Manchester United]] lost against Barcelona in the European Cup in 1994 with 4-0, [[Sir Alex Ferguson]] remarked about the system Cruyff was using:

As [[Jonathan Wilson (writer)|Jonathan Wilson]] writes, "He [Cruyff] was a beautiful, brilliant and inspirational player and that alone would have placed him firmly in the pantheon, but what he did as a coach is unparalleled. When he took over Barcelona in 1988, they had won two league titles in 28 years. Crisis had followed crisis. In the 27 years since, they have won 13 [[List of Spanish football champions|league titles]] and five Champions Leagues... All with the football of Cruyff."&lt;ref name="JonathanWilson"/&gt; At Barcelona, he assembled the so-called ''[[FC Barcelona#Dream Team|Dream Team]]'' with brilliant graduates from La Masia as well as world-class foreign players. He used a mix of Spanish players like Pep Guardiola, [[José Mari Bakero]] and [[Txiki Begiristain]] while signing international players such as [[Ronald Koeman]], [[Michael Laudrup]], [[Romário]] and [[Hristo Stoichkov]]. Under Cruyff's guidance, Barcelona won four consecutive La Liga titles from 1991 to 1994 and the club's first European Cup in particular. They beat [[U.C. Sampdoria|Sampdoria]] in both the 1989 UEFA Cup Winners' Cup final and the 1992 European Cup final at [[Wembley]], with a free kick goal from Dutch international Ronald Koeman. They also won a Copa del Rey in 1990, the European Super Cup in 1992 and three Supercopa de España trophies. With 11 trophies, Cruyff became the club's most successful manager at that point. He also became the club's longest consecutive serving manager, serving eight years.

Cruyff is officially considered as the founding father of now famous Barça-Ajax school of football (also known as 'Barçajax school'), with a distinctive footballing philosophy and [[tiki-taka|predominant style of play]], that was born in Barcelona but has roots in the 1970s Dutch (Amsterdam) school of [[Total Football]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2015/apr/23/jose-mourinho-the-anti-barcelona-chelsea-pep-guardiola |author=Wilson, Jonathan |title=José Mourinho, the anti-Barcelona, stands alone in modern football |work=The Guardian |date=23 April 2015 |accessdate=23 July 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/may/12/future-football-tactics-evolution-invoke-the-past |author=Wilson, Jonathan |title=Back to the future: how football's tactical evolution has begun to invoke the past |work=The Guardian |date=12 May 2016 |accessdate=12 August 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[La Masia]], Barça's youth academy and talent factory, was among Cruyff's lasting legacy. It was the brainchild of Cruyff. In 1979, he wanted to establish a copy of the [[Ajax Youth Academy]] in Barcelona. His proposal was accepted by president Josep Núñez. It was ten years after the inception of the youth program, La Masia, when the young players began to graduate and play for their first team. One of the first graduates, who would later earn international acclaim, was previous Barcelona coach Pep Guardiola. On 11 July 2010, Spain won the [[2010 FIFA World Cup Final|World Cup final]] with eight players from Barcelona; seven were from La Masia, and six of them were in the starting line-up: [[Gerard Piqué]], [[Carles Puyol]], Andrés Iniesta, Xavi, [[Sergio Busquets]], and [[Pedro (footballer, born July 1987)|Pedro]]. This set a record for the most players to be provided by a club side for a team in a World Cup final. On 10 January 2011, La Masia achieved a record breaking honour becoming the first [[youth academy]] to have trained all three finalists for the [[Ballon d'Or]] in a single year, with Andrés Iniesta, Lionel Messi and Xavi. On 25 November 2012, for the first time in the club's history, away at [[Levante UD|Levante]]'s [[Estadi Ciutat de València]], Barcelona played with eleven players formed at La Masia. In an English biography of Pep Guardiola, [[Guillem Balagué]] writes, "Cruyff introduced some passing drills into Barça's 'arterial' system. And since then, the ''rondos'' have been not just a method but a symbol of the club's playing style: of dominating and never losing the ball. Cruyff blended several ideas and concepts and converted them into a philosophy – the seeds of which were planted throughout a club in urgent need of a footballing identity. Until then, the first team of Barcelona had been comfortably living in a world of excuses and enemies, content with their role as victims when faced with Real Madrid, an institution seen from Catalonia as the club of the Establishment", and adding, "Xavi Hernández describes the style in its purest form: 'I pass the ball and move, or I pass the ball and stay where I am. I make myself available to help you; I look at you. I stop, I keep my head up and look, and, above all, I open up the pitch. Whoever has the ball is running play. That comes from the school of Johan Cuyff and Pep Guardiola. This is Barça.'"&lt;ref name="Balagué 2013"/&gt; On the legacy of Cruyff's football philosophy and the passing style of play he introduced to the club, former Barcelona manager Guardiola stated, "Cruyff built the cathedral, our job is to maintain and renovate it."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=The inventor of modern football|url=http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/9eb4d622-0a31-11e5-a6a8-00144feabdc0.html|work=Financial Times|date=25 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; One of the most famous La Masia graduates, Xavi, said, "He [Cruyff] changed the idiosyncrasy of the club. He introduced the philosophy to keep the ball, to play in triangles, to attack. That philosophy remains true to this day. We're all students of Cruyff and his school of thought."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thenational.ae/sport/football/barcas-xavi-were-playing-a-great-team-in-manchester-united |author=Mitten, Andy |title=Barca's Xavi: 'We're playing a great team in Manchester United' |publisher=TheNational.ae |date=26 May 2011 |accessdate=26 August 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

All of those players were either recruited to Barcelona as stripling kids or bought as professional talents based on the football bible that Cruyff wrote. Talent over height. Brains over brawn.

Writing in his weekly blog for ''[http://www.kicca.com/ Kicca.com]'', Spanish international midfielder [[Juan Mata]], a graduate of [[La Fábrica|Real Madrid's youth academy]], hails Cruyff's overall footballing vision, "I consider him [Cruyff] the ideological father of the football; the one I try to play like and the one I look to learn from as a spectator whenever I watch a game.

Such financial muscle explains Barca's place among the super clubs, but not their dominance of them. &lt;br/&gt; This is not about the power of money. It is about the power of ideas – and one grand idea in particular. It has almost become modern Barcelona's creation myth: how Johan Cruyff descended from the heavens to create a club in his own image and instill a belief system which even to this day creates religious fervour. [[Luis Enrique (footballer)|Enrique]] may have tinkered with aspects of Barcelona's approach but the fundamentals remain in place. &lt;br/&gt; It is the idea of [[La Masia]] and the idea of football played in line with Cruyffian ethics – an ideological position on the mode of production and the style of play. First aroused by the Dream Team in 1992 it was reignited by a new generation: Lionel Messi, Xavi and Andres Iniesta, who have won the Champions League in 2006, 2009, 2011 and 2015. |date=7 June 2015 |accessdate=10 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Club legacy"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.espnfc.com/blog/espn-fc-united-blog/68/post/2836000/johan-cruyff-refined-total-football-as-games-trailblazer |author=[[Gabriele Marcotti|Marcotti, Gabriele]] |title=Johan Cruyff was one of football's greatest trailblazers on and off pitch |publisher=ESPN FC |quote=You can separate [[History of FC Barcelona|Barça's history]] into BCE (Before Cruyff Era) and CE (Cruyff Era). And, yes, Barça are still, nearly 20 years after he coached his final game for the club, still very much in the Cruyff Era. &lt;br/&gt; It is difficult to overstate the impact he had. His own natural vision for the game, the concepts of Rinus Michels' Total Football, and the experiences gleaned in a 20-year playing career formed the blueprint, but his great merit was to synthesize and tweak it to suit Catalan football. The building blocks were possession, pressing and proactivity, the idea that the opposition would adjust to you, not the other way around. &lt;br/&gt; The concept was that football was something to be done right, or not done at all. A quote often attributed to him – possibly apocryphal, but nevertheless truer than so much of what managers say – was that he'd rather play well and lose than play poorly and win. &lt;br/&gt; For Cruyff, playing well suggested adhering to certain fundamental canons of style and execution. That Cruyff "idea of football" has come to mean many things to many people. It's almost easier to define it by what it is not: It's not a philosophy based on waiting for your opponent to make a mistake, unless it's a mistake that you cause them to make through your own excellence. |date=24 March 2016 |accessdate=2 July 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt; La Masia, Barça's youth academy, was the brainchild of Cruyff. As a prominent graduate from the famed [[Ajax Youth Academy]], he always believed using regularly young home-grown players in first-team squad. He established a unique model at La Masia where the youth players could grow up and have a better chance to be part of the senior team, as they would already be accustomed to the style of play. As former La Masia technical director Pep Segura said of Cruyff: "It is about creating one philosophy, one mentality, from the bottom of the club to the top. Cruyff is the one who started it all. He has been the club's most influential figure. We all have the ability to do certain things, but I would not have been able to build something from scratch like Cruyff did. I learned a lot of things from him. I cannot imagine the current Barcelona without Cruyff's work."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.skysports.com/football/news/11833/8925645/football-philosopher |author=Bate, Adam |title=Football philosopher |publisher=Sky Sports |date=17 September 2013 |accessdate=27 August 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The style of play Cruyff introduced at Barcelona came to be known as ''[[tiki-taka]]''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://en.as.com/en/2016/03/24/football/1458826060_560947.html |title=Legacy of a legend: Johan Cruyff |publisher=AS.com |author=Browne, Kenneth |quote=When he [Cruyff] walked into the dressing room and drew 3–4–3 on the tactics board for the first time, this is how the players reacted: "We looked at each other and said: ‘What the hell is this?!’ This was the era of [[4-4-2 formation|4–4–2]] or 3–5–2", explained [[Eusebio Sacristán|Eusebio]], who had come to Barcelona to play under Cruyff, "He single-handedly introduced a new way of playing football in Spain. It was a revolution". &lt;br/&gt; "I much prefer to win 5–4 than 1–0" said the erstwhile manager, and set about finding the players that fit his ideology. This was 1988 when players were chosen for their physique, or more accurately, not chosen because of it. Even Barcelona had 'a prueba de la muneca' – the wrist test – that discounted anyone at 15 who didn’t look like growing to be at least 5’11. &lt;br/&gt; Cruyff changed that, focussing instead on ability and technique, cultivating players who treated the ball with care, were quick and pressed the opposition. One benefactor of this new policy was a skinny 15 year-old named [[Pep Guardiola]], who would play an integral part in the club's first European Cup success as a player in 1992, then manage the team in their most successful period ever. "Johan Cruyff painted the chapel, and Barcelona coaches since merely restore or improve it", was how Pep put it. The Dutch master was the Godfather of La Masia, Barça's talent factory that has since become a production line of footballing prodigies.

The way we played under Cruyff was revolutionary. In my eyes it was sometimes too attacking but that was Johan Cruyff for you... Our game was full of risk. I was not even a real defender and had to move into midfield with the ball whenever possible. We also pushed right up in every game. It created fantastic games to watch but we were also punished. We left big spaces behind our defence, but Cruyff said we would win the majority of our games and he was right... Cruyff was deliberately looking for players who could play in the attacking style he had been used to in the total Dutch football of the seventies. He brought in [[Michael Laudrup]], he bought me and [[Hristo Stoichkov]]... When Cruyff brought Pep [Guardiola] into the squad, he said to me, ‘You are going to look after this boy. You are going to be his tutor, help him develop and make sure he learns the Dutch style of play.’ From the very beginning he [Guardiola] was asking me everything about the [[Ajax Academy|Ajax youth academy]].

When Cruyff became Barcelona's manager in 1988, he reinforced this philosophy and, although he saw the version of the game practised by his successor as manager, [[Louis van Gaal]], as overly mechanised, the starting point was the same. This was perhaps the greatest coaching seminar in history, and the philosophy it taught was that which had been flowing from Ajax to Barcelona, which believed the same things but had more money, for three decades: what we might perhaps term the Barçajax school." |date=22 December 2015 |accessdate=12 July 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Germany national football team|Germany national team]] that won the [[2014 FIFA World Cup|2014 World Cup]] had deep Cruyffian (via Pep Guardiola) influences.

In old football, a goalkeeper's job was to stay on his line and stop shots. But in the run-up to the 1974 World Cup, Cruyff persuaded [[Rinus Michels|Michels]] to pick [[Jan Jongbloed]], a goalkeeper who liked to roam far from his line and was unusually good with his feet. His style, now routinely copied by goalkeepers around the world, allowed the Netherlands to press even higher up the field."&lt;/ref&gt; It had always bothered Cruyff that goalkeepers just stopped shots. He thought it was a waste of a player. As Cruyff once said, "In my teams, the goalie (goalkeeper) is the first [[Forward (association football)|attacker]] and the [[Forward (association football)|striker]] the first [[Defender (association football)|defender]]."&lt;ref name="RamonCalderon_RealMadrid"/&gt; He wanted a goalkeeper who could also get involved in the [[passing (association football)|passing]].

It marks him out from the vast majority of other coaches who, to a greater or lesser degree, think winning is more important. Being pragmatic is often a euphemism for winning ugly, and Cruyff has never signed up for that cynicism. In the 1960s, the win-at-all-costs mentality was epitomized by the Italian teams who played ''[[catenaccio]]'', the Italian system focused on defending. Cruyff and his fellow Dutchmen became the heroes of those who wanted football to be more uplifting... He sees winning and beauty as inseparable. He was once asked whether he'd be willing to play with a mainly defensive system to win the league. He said no because it would be too boring. &lt;br/&gt; ...Cruyff's admirers don't just like the way he and his teams played. They believe the world could be a better place if his vision of football prevailed. Cruyffian football, they feel, is more beautiful, more fun and more spiritual than other approaches... Until relatively recently, English football was synonymous with long balls, bad ball control and big, clumsy centre-forwards charging into lumbering centre-halves. Now, most of the top coaches at the Premier League's biggest clubs are either Dutch or heavily influenced by the Dutch.

===In popular culture===
In 2018, Cruyff was added as an icon to the Ultimate Team in [[EA Sports]]’ [[FIFA (video game series)|''FIFA'']] video game ''[[FIFA 19]]'', receiving a 94 rating.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=FIFA 19 Ultimate Team: What Icons are in the new game and how do you get them? |url=http://www.goal.com/en-ie/news/fifa-19-ultimate-team-what-icons-are-in-the-new-game-and-how/1qrv1f9kllmhd12ffdqdmfy91j |accessdate=12 September 2018 |publisher=''Goal''}}&lt;/ref&gt; British sportswriter David Winner's 2000 book on Dutch football, ''Brilliant Orange'', mentions Cruyff frequently. In the book, Dutch football's ideas (in particular Cruyff's) effectively related to the use of space in [[Dutch art|Dutch painting]] and [[Dutch architecture]].

In 1976, the Italian-language [[documentary film]] ''Il profeta del gol'' was directed by Sandro Ciotti. The documentary narrates the successes of Johan Cruyff's football career in the 1970s. In 2004, the documentary film ''Johan Cruijff – En un momento dado'' ("''Johan Cruijff – At Any Given Moment''") was made by Ramon Gieling and charts the years Cruyff spent at Barcelona, the club where he had the most profound effect in both a footballing and cultural sense. In 2014, the Catalan-language documentary film ''L'últim partit: 40 anys de Johan Cruyff a Catalunya'' was directed by Jordi Marcos, celebrating 40 years since Johan Cruyff signed for Barcelona in August 1973.

British rock band [[The Hours (band)|The Hours]] recorded a song called "Love You More" in 2007. In it lead singer [[Antony Genn]] described his partner as "Better than [[Elvis Presley|Elvis]] in his '68 comeback, Better than Cruyff in '74..", In an interview with German daily ''[[Sueddeutsche Zeitung]]'' in 2008, when [[German Chancellor]] [[Angela Merkel]] was discussing the upcoming Euro 2008, she praised Cruyff's performance at the 1974 World Cup: "Cruyff really impressed me. I think I wasn't the only one in Europe."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sueddeutsche.de/sport/interview-mit-angela-merkel-ballack-saechselt-wenigstens-noch-1.200643-2 |title= Interview mit Angela Merkel – "Ballack sächselt wenigstens noch" |publisher=[[Süddeutsche Zeitung]] (sueddeutsche.de) |quote=[[Angela Merkel]]: "Cruyff hat mich beeindruckt.

In February 2014, President of Israel [[Shimon Peres]], at his residence in [[Jerusalem]], welcomed Cruyff and praising [[Johan Cruyff Foundation|his foundation]]'s dedication to peace, "People remember very well that not only were you an outstanding football player but that you gave football a social content, you made it an educational process. You are a role model. Football is one of the great ways to make peace among people. When a player like you arrives in our country the eyes of the children light up—Jewish, Arab or Muslim."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.i24news.tv/en/news/israel/society/140223-peres-cheers-football-legend-s-peacemaking-assist |title=Peres cheers football legend's peacemaking assist |publisher=[[i24news|i24news.tv]] |date=23 February 2014 |accessdate=2 July 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160815121018/http://www.i24news.tv/en/news/israel/society/140223-peres-cheers-football-legend-s-peacemaking-assist# |archive-date=15 August 2016 |dead-url=yes |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the Netherlands, and to some extent Spain, Cruyff is famous for his one-liners that usually hover between brilliant insight and the blatantly obvious. They are famous for their Amsterdam dialect and incorrect grammar, and often feature [[tautology (rhetoric)|tautologies]] and [[paradoxes]].&lt;ref name=onzetaal&gt;Guus Middag and Kees van der Zwan, [http://www.cruyff.com/asp/ned/werkenleven.asp?page=fenomeen-cruyffanders-taalgebruik "Utopieën wie nooit gebeuren". De taal van Johan Cruijff] ("Utopias who never happen". The language of Johan Cruijff), Genootschap Onze Taal&lt;/ref&gt; In Spain, his most famous statement is ''"En un momento dado"'' ("In any given moment"). The quote has been used for the title of a 2004 documentary about Cruyff's life: ''Johan Cruijff – En un momento dado''. In the Netherlands, his most famous one-liner is ''"Ieder nadeel heb z'n voordeel''" ("Every disadvantage has its advantage") and his way of expressing himself has been dubbed "[[Cruijffiaans]]". Cruyff rarely limited himself to a single line though, and in a comparison with the equally oracular but reserved football manager Rinus Michels, [[Kees Fens]] equated Cruyff's monologues to experimental prose, "without a subject, only an attempt to drop words in a sea of uncertainty (...) there is no full stop".&lt;ref name=onzetaal/&gt;

He had a small hit (number 21 in the charts) in the Netherlands with "[[Oei Oei Oei (Dat Was Me Weer Een Loei)]]". Upon arriving in Barcelona, the Spanish branch of [[Polydor]] decided to release the single in Spain as well, where it was rather popular.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/2007/aug/22/theknowledge.sport|title=Does Shay Given really carry holy water with him at every match?|work=The Guardian|date=22 August 2007|accessdate=26 March 2010|location=London, UK|first=James|last=Dart}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Cruyff suffered a [[heart attack]] (like his father who died of a heart attack when he was 12) in his early forties. He used to smoke 20 [[cigarettes]] a day prior to undergoing double heart bypass surgery in 1991 while he was the coach of Barcelona. Cruyff was forced to immediately give up [[smoking]], and he made an [[anti-smoking]] advertisement for the Catalan Department of Health. In the [[TV spot]], Cruyff is dressed like a manager in a long trench coat combined with collared shirt and [[necktie|tie]]. He juggled a [[cigarette pack]] 16 times – using feet, thighs, chest, shoulder, and head like holding up a [[ball (association football)|ball]] – before [[volley (football)|volleying]] it away. Throughout the commercial he speaks in Catalan about the dangers of smoking.&lt;ref&gt;Witzig, Richard (2006). ''The Global Art of Soccer''. (CusiBoy Publishing, {{ISBN|9780977668809}}), p. 123&lt;/ref&gt;

In November 2003, Cruyff invoked legal proceedings against the publisher Tirion Uitgevers, over its photo book ''Johan Cruyff de Ajacied'' ("''Johan Cruijff the Ajax player''"), which used photographs by Guus de Jong. Cruyff was working on another book, also using De Jong's photographs, and claimed unsuccessfully that Tirion's book violated his [[trademark]] and [[portrait]] rights.

In 2004, a public poll in the Netherlands to determine the greatest [[Dutch people|Dutchman]] ("''[[De Grootste Nederlander]]''") named Cruyff the 6th-greatest Dutchman of all time, with Cruyff finishing above [[Rembrandt]] (9th) and [[Vincent van Gogh]] (10th).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.geschiedenis24.nl/speler.program.7055644.html "De Grootste Nederlander Deel 6: Johan Cruijff"]; retrieved 9 September 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; In 2010, the [[asteroid]] ([[minor planet]]) ''[[:de:(14282) Cruijff|14282 Cruijff (2097 P-L)]]'' was named after him. The [[International Astronomical Union]] (IAU) officially ratified the naming of Cruijff on 23 September 2010. After [[Josef Bican]] and Ferenc Puskás, Cruyff is the third football player to have an asteroid named after him.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.xs4all.nl/~carlkop/ecruijff.html JOHAN CRUIJFF CONTINUES TO PLAY FOOTBALL IN OUTER SPACE; Minor planet 14282 now named "Cruijff"], Xs4all.nl; retrieved 18 January 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.goal.com/en-india/news/628/other-top-stories/2010/09/23/2133073/asteroid-named-after-netherlands-barcelona-legend-johan Asteroid Named After Netherlands &amp; Barcelona Legend Johan Cruyff].

==Nicknames==
There were many [[nicknames]] Cruyff had in the Netherlands and Spain, including "Jopie", "Nummer 14",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.rnw.org/archive/johan-cruijffs-14-lives |title= Johan Cruijff's 14 lives |publisher=RNW Media (Radio Netherlands Worldwide) |quote=Cruijff began his career at Ajax with the number 9.

==Outside football==

===Hobbies===
Outside football, Cruyff's favourite sport (and hobby) was [[golf]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.thecourier.co.uk/news/111749/johan-cruyffs-goal-is-clear-at-dunhill-links-championship/ |title=Johan Cruyff's goal is clear at Dunhill Links Championship |publisher=The Courier (thecourier.co.uk) |date=4 September 2012 |accessdate=24 September 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thescottishsun.co.uk/scotsol/homepage/sport/scotlandinternational/7028823/Gordon-Strachans-superhero-tribute-to-legend-Johan-Cruyff.html |title=Gordon Strachan's 'superhero' tribute to legend Johan Cruyff |publisher= The Scottish Sun (thescottishsun.co.uk) |date=25 March 2016 |accessdate=25 September 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.scotsman.com/sport/football/teams/st-mirren/when-johan-cruyff-came-to-paisley-1-4083277 |author=Halliday, Stephen |title= When Johan Cruyff came to Paisley |work=The Scotsman |date=27 March 2016 |accessdate=27 September 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In the 1970s, Cruyff loved to collect cars. In the Sandro Ciotti's documentary film ''Il Profeta del gol'' (1976), Cruyff said, "I like to drive for the 20 km that separate the training camp from my house, it relaxes me. I love the cars."&lt;ref name="NSSMag.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nssmag.com/en/pills/8440/stile-johan-cruyff |title= Johan Cruyff's Style, New Sport Side |publisher=NssMagazine (NSSMag.com) |author=Abazia, Francesco |date=25 March 2016 |accessdate=10 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Business ventures===
In 1979, Cruyff was reaching the twilight of his career in Barcelona. He began to imagine creating a range of [[footwear]] himself to challenge the technical and luxury qualities of those on the market beforehand. After a few years of trying and failing to encourage big [[sportswear (fashion)|sportswear]] brands to take his idea seriously, after all this was quite an unusual ambition of a professional sportsman at the time. Eventually he combined with his close friend, Italian designer Emilio Lazzarini, and using his knowledge he set out to create a technical shoe which managed to balance functionality with elegance. Initially the range was filled with "luxury" indoor football shoes, but they quickly became used as a fashion shoe due to their attractive appearance. And so Cruyff Classics brand was born.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.cruyffclassics.com/en/historia |title=Cruyff Classics: history of the brand |publisher=Cruyff Classics official website |accessdate=2 July 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.worldofjohancruyff.com/cruyff-classics/ |title= Cruyff Classics |publisher= Johan Cruyff Management (worldofjohancruyff.com) |accessdate=2 July 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Writing===
Cruyff is the author/co-author of several books (in Dutch and Spanish) about his football career, in particular his principles and view about the football world. He also wrote his weekly columns for ''[[El Periódico de Catalunya|El Periódico]]'' (Barcelona-based newspaper) and ''[[De Telegraaf]]'' (Amsterdam-based newspaper).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nltimes.nl/2016/03/25/dutch-newspapers-pay-tribute-to-football-legend-johan-cruijff/ |author=Pieters, Janene |title=Dutch newspapers pay tribute to football legend Johan Cruijff |publisher=NL Times (nltimes.nl) |date=25 March 2016 |accessdate=25 September 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Cruyff was a [[multilingual]], as British football writer [[Brian Glanville]] described, "his intelligence off the field as well as on it was quite remarkable. How well I remember seeing Cruyff surrounded by journalists from all over the world in 1978 to whose questions he replied almost casually in a multiplicity of languages. Not only Dutch, but English, French, Spanish and German."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sportstarlive.com/columns/kickingaround-brian-glanville/goodbye-mr-total-football/article8409301.ece |author=[[Brian Glanville|Glanville, Brian]] |title=Goodbye Mr. Total Football |publisher=Sportstarlive.com |date=15 June 2016 |accessdate=25 August 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Johan Cruyff Foundation]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cruyff-foundation.org Johan Cruyff Foundation], cruyff-foundation.org; accessed 25 October 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; has provided over 200 Cruyff courts in 22 countries, including Israel, Malaysia, Japan, United States and Mexico, for children of all backgrounds to play street football together. [[UEFA]] praised the foundation for its positive effect on young people, and Cruyff received the UEFA Grassroots Award on the opening of the 100th court in late 2009.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.uefa.com/memberassociations/association=ned/news/newsid=1789173.html "Johan Cruyff celebrates his 65th birthday"], FIFA.com; retrieved 21 March 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1999, he founded the [[Johan Cruyff Institute]] with a program for 35 athletes as part of the Johan Cruyff University of Amsterdam and has since become a global network.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Johan Cruyff Institute: About us|url=http://cruyffinstitute.org/en/about-us/|publisher=Cruyffinstitute.org|accessdate=25 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Born in the heavily damaged [[Netherlands in World War II|post–World War II Netherlands]], Cruyff came from a humble background and lost his father as a child. This had a great influence on his future career and character. He was renowned for his strong [[personality]]. His character, both in and beyond the footballing world, was much described as the complicated combination of an idealist,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.telegraaf.nl/telesport/voetbal/20044900/__Johan_Cruijff__Rebel_en_idealist__.html |author=de Groot, Jaap |title= Johan Cruijff: Rebel en idealist |publisher=Telegraaf.nl |date=25 April 2012 |accessdate=25 August 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt; individualist, libertarian, collectivist, romantic, purist, pragmatist, rebel,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.newstalk.com/elko-born-on-cruyff-legacy |author=Born, Elko |title=How Cruyff became more of an "ultimate hero" to the Dutch than any artist, king or queen |publisher=Newstalk.com |date=25 March 2016 |accessdate=25 August 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and even despot.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iris-france.org/78968-johan-cruyff-genie-pop-et-despote-3-questions-a-cherif-ghemmour/ |author=Boniface, Pascal |title=Johan Cruyff – génie pop et despote » – 3 questions à Chérif Ghemmour |publisher=Iris-France.org (Institut de Relations Internationales et Stratégiques) |date=29 August 2016 |accessdate=19 September 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Dutch sportswriter [[Johan Derksen]], a close friend of Cruyff, once said of him, "Johan [Cruijff] is absolutely religious, though he never goes to church."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cip.nl/nieuws/maart-2016/55508-johan-cruijf-van-god-heb-ik-een-hoop-kwaliteiten-gehad |title= Cruijf: Van God heb ik een hoop kwaliteiten gehad |publisher=CIP.nl (Christelijke Informatie Platform) |date=25 March 2016 |accessdate=25 September 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In August 1973, Ajax players voted for [[Piet Keizer]] to be the team's captain in a secret ballot, ahead of Cruyff. And Cruyff decided his time in Amsterdam had come to an end. He joined Barcelona just weeks later, two years before the Spanish dictator [[Francisco Franco]] died, maintaining to the European press corps en route that he chose Barcelona over rivals Real Madrid because he could never join a club "[[Francoist Spain|associated with Franco]]".&lt;ref&gt;Fitzpatrick, Richard (2012). ''El Clásico: Barcelona v Real Madrid: Football's Greatest Rivalry''. (Bloomsbury Publishing)&lt;/ref&gt; As he recalled in a documentary on TV3 channel, "I remember my move to Spain was quite controversial. (...) The president of Ajax wanted to sell me to Real Madrid, (...) Barcelona weren't at the same level as Madrid football wise, but it was a challenge to play for a Catalan club. Barcelona was more than a club."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.football-oranje.com/cruyff-almost-joined-real-madrid/ |author=Dhingra, Himanshu |title=''Cruyff: I almost joined Real Madrid'' |publisher=Football Oranje |date=21 January 2015 |accessdate=20 October 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt; At the end of the 1982–83 season, Ajax decided not to offer Cruyff a new contract. This angered Cruyff and he responded by signing for [[De Klassieker|Ajax's archrivals]] Feyenoord. Cruyff's season at Feyenoord was a successful one in which the club won the Eredivisie for the first time in a decade, part of a league and KNVB Cup double.&lt;ref name="Dutch title"/&gt;

Cruyff's strong personality played a historical role in the eternal struggle between [[Puma SE|Puma]] and [[Adidas]], the two rival brands that were born from the political divisions between the two Dassler brothers.&lt;ref name="NSSMag.com"/&gt; Cruyff was a big fan of [[Puma SE|Puma]]'s ''King'' boots and by 1974 had signed a sponsorship deal with German sportswear and equipment supplier. At the 1974 World Cup, Johan Cruyff was under contract with Puma in a deal that prohibited him from promoting other sports brands. As the tournament approached, Cruyff flatly refused to wear [[Adidas]]'s trademark three black stripes on his No. 14 jersey. The Netherlands national football association had little choice but to honor the wishes of their best player, and Dutch officials eventually persuaded Adidas to design a separate jersey just for Cruyff, with just two stripes running along the sleeves.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.puma-catchup.com/johan-cruyff-dont-want-to-wear-adidas/ |title=Johan Cruyff – don't want to wear ADIDAS |publisher=PUMA CATch up (puma-catchup.com) |date=4 November 2015 |accessdate=12 July 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/sport/football/news-and-comment/johan-cruyff-dead-why-cruyff-refused-to-wear-the-trademark-three-stripes-of-adidas-at-the-1974-world-a6950181.html |author=Orr, James |title=Why Cruyff refused to wear the trademark three stripes of Adidas at the 1974 World Cup |work=The Independent |date=24 March 2016 |accessdate=12 July 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Jersey number 14===
[[File:Finale wereldkampioenschap voetbal 1974 in Munchen, West Duitsland tegen Nederland 2-1; Cruyff verlaat het veld.jpg|thumb|right|Cruyff wearing number 14, the number most identified with him.&lt;ref name="Number 14"/&gt;]]
Until the 1990s, players did not have fixed numbering — except in some short competitions like the World Cup or European Championship where players were given a designated number. The starting players usually wore jerseys from 1 to 11 and the substitutes, from 12 to 16. Cruyff's usual number was 9.&lt;ref name="Number 14"/&gt;

On 30 October 1970, Cruyff was coming back from a long-time injury to play Ajax's bitter rivals PSV. However, in the locker room before the match, teammate [[Gerrie Muhren]] couldn't find his jersey number 7. Cruyff offered his shirt to Muhren and went to the basket to pick another one at random. It happened to be the number 14.&lt;ref name="Number 14"/&gt; Ajax won 1–0 and Cruyff suggested they keep the same numbers to the following game — according to Muhren, on an interview to ''Voetbal International'', it was a form to challenge the Dutch Football Association.&lt;ref name="Number 14"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/sport/football/news-and-comment/why-did-johan-cruyff-wear-number-14-a6950206.html |author=Sheen, Tom |title=Johan Cruyff: Why the Dutch master wore the famous number 14 shirt |publisher=Independent.co.uk |date=24 March 2016 |accessdate=2 February 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt; From then on, Cruyff kept using the number 14 for Ajax and Netherlands national team when he was allowed to.&lt;ref name="FIFA Profile"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Number 14"/&gt;

In the [[1974 FIFA World Cup]], Netherlands' head coach Rinus Michels wanted his squad to wear numbers alphabetically. As Cruyff was the first player on roster, he would be number 1, but he refused and insisted to wear his lucky number 14.&lt;ref name="Number 14"/&gt; Forward Ruud Geels ended up with the No 1 shirt while goalkeeper [[Jan Jongbloed]] played as the number 8.

Although the number 14 had become a trademark for Cruyff, he could be seen wearing his old number 9 on other occasions, like on most of his career for [[FC Barcelona]], because the league demanded starting players were numbered 1 to 11,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sport-english.com/en/news/barca/why-did-the-late-great-johan-cruyff-wear-the-shirt-5004795 |author=Giraldo, Javier |title=Why did the late, great Johan Cruyff wear the No 14 shirt? |publisher=sport-english.com |date=25 March 2016 |accessdate=2 February 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt; or for Netherlands in the [[UEFA Euro 1976|1976 European Championship]]. In 2007, Ajax retired Cruyff’s number 14.&lt;ref name="Number 14"/&gt;

===Relations with others===
Cruyff had remained a highly controversial figure throughout his life. Cruyff's relationships with Ajax, Barça, and [[KNVB]] ([[Royal Dutch Football Association]]) were turbulent for some time, especially in his later years. Also, in his native Netherlands, there has been always a [[love-hate relationship]] between Cruyff and his fellow countrymen.&lt;ref name="SimonKuperFFT2009"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fourfourtwo.com/features/johan-cruyff-icon |author=[[Simon Kuper|Kuper, Simon]] |title=Johan Cruyff: The player, the coach, the legacy.

When Cruyff returned to Ajax in 1981, the Dutch were sceptical. The Calvinist Holland of the time distrusted anyone who thought he was special.

He only cares about the result and doesn't care much for good football." As [[David Winner (author)|David Winner]] notes, "Cruyff has had many enemies and critics over the years."&lt;ref name="DWinner_Cruyff'sChurch"/&gt; He has been accused of being arrogant, greedy,&lt;ref name="SimonKuperFFT2009"/&gt; intolerant, despotic, "too idealistic, too stubborn, insufficiently interested in defending and simply too difficult a personality. He loves an argument, and his conflict-model method of working can be bruising."&lt;ref name="DWinner_Cruyff'sChurch"/&gt; And Winner concludes that, "With his belief in the "conflict model" – the idea that you got the best out of people by provoking fights and thereby raising levels of excitement and adrenaline – Cruyff made enemies almost as easily as he generated delight. Battles with club presidents and teammates led to ruptures, especially at Ajax and Barcelona, the two clubs that defined his career."&lt;ref name="Winner"/&gt;

===Criticism===
Cruyff was also well known for his vocal [[criticism]] and uncompromising attitude. A [[perfectionism (psychology)|perfectionist]], he always had a strong opinion about things and was even loyal to his principles more than any thing else in the football world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.newstalk.com/Johan-Cruyffs-views-on-the-2010-World-Cup-final-shows-how-much-he-valued-Total-Football |author=Kelly, Daniel |title=Johan Cruyff's views on the 2010 World Cup final shows how much he valued Total Football |publisher=Newstalk.com |date=26 March 2016 |accessdate=26 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; As an outspoken and critical visionary, he strongly criticized the Netherlands' style of play at the [[2010 FIFA World Cup|2010 World Cup]]. "Who am I supporting? I am Dutch but I support the football that Spain is playing. [[Tiki-taka|Spain's style is the style of Barcelona]]... Spain, a replica of Barça, is the best publicity for football", Cruyff wrote in his weekly column for the Barcelona-based newspaper ''[[El Periódico de Catalunya|El Periodico]]'', prior to the [[2010 FIFA World Cup Final|final match]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.goal.com/en-gb/news/2890/world-cup-2010/2010/07/08/2016282/world-cup-2010-dutch-legend-johan-cruyff-views-spain-as |author=Malek, Cyrus C. |title=''World Cup 2010: Dutch legend Johan Cruyff views Spain as final favourites'' |publisher=Goal.com |date=8 July 2010 |accessdate=20 October 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Until the early 2010s, Barcelona had mounting debts, built up over the past few seasons, a situation that forced the club to push through an emergency bailout loan of €150 million. The [[Qatar Foundation]], run by [[Sheikha Mozah Bint Nasser Al Missned|Sheikha Mozah]], became the first shirt sponsor in Barcelona's 111-year history. The club had previously used [[UNICEF]]'s logo on the front of its shirts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.goal.com/en/news/12/spanish-football/2011/04/22/2452965/qatar-foundation-deal-may-have-kept-messi-at-barcelona-but |author=McLean, Andrew |title=Qatar Foundation deal may have kept Messi at Barcelona but Cruyff believes club has become vulgar |publisher=Goal.com |date=22 April 2011 |accessdate=22 July 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2011, incoming Barcelona president [[Sandro Rosell]] agreed the deal for a period of five seasons, with the club receiving €30 million each year, starting on 1 July 2011 and running until 30 June 2016, plus bonuses for trophies won that could total €5m.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.goal.com/en/news/1717/editorial/2011/09/05/2651299/more-than-just-a-logo-barcelona-fans-need-to-back-qatar |author=Hayward, Ben |title=More than just a logo – Barcelona fans need to back Qatar Foundation in order to stay ahead of Real Madrid |publisher= Goal.com |date=5 September 2011 |accessdate=5 August 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Writing in his ''[[El Periódico de Catalunya|El Periodico]]'' column, Cruyff slammed the deal, "We are a unique club in the world, no one has kept their jersey intact throughout their history, yet have remained as competitive as they come... We have sold this uniqueness for about six percent of our budget. I understand that we are currently losing more than we are earning. However, by selling the shirt it shows me that we are not being creative, and that we have become vulgar."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.goal.com/en/news/12/spanish-football/2010/12/13/2259034/barcelona-legend-johan-cruyff-criticises-clubs-shirt-sponsorship-|author=Macdonald, Paul |title= Barcelona Legend Johan Cruyff Criticises Club's Shirt Sponsorship Deal With Qatar Foundation |publisher=Goal.com |date=13 December 2010 |accessdate=13 July 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In an interview with ''[[The Guardian]]''{{'}}s Donald McRae in 2014, Cruyff said about football's lost values and how money had eroded the game's purity, "Football is now all about money. There are problems with the values within the game. This is sad because football is the most beautiful game. We can play it in the street. We can play it everywhere. Everyone can play it whether you’re tall or small, fat or thin. But those values are being lost. We have to bring them back."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/mar/26/johan-cruyff-1974-world-cup-donald-mcrae |author=McRae, Donald |title=Johan Cruyff: ‘Maybe we were the real winners in 1974.

==Personal life==
[[File:Johan Cruijff and Danny Coster 1968.jpg|thumb|left|Cruyff and Danny Coster getting married on 2 December 1968]]
At the wedding of Ajax teammate [[Piet Keizer]], on 13 June 1967, Cruyff met his future wife, Diana Margaretha "Danny" Coster (b. 1949). They started dating, and on 2 December 1968, at the age of 21, he married Danny. Her father was Dutch businessman Cor Coster who also happened to be Cruyff's agent. He was also credited with engineering Cruyff's move to [[FC Barcelona]] in 1973. The marriage is said to have been [[Golden wedding|happy for almost 50 years]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.espnfc.com/story/528411/hard-to-explain |title=Hard to explain |publisher=ESPN FC |last=Bouwes |first=Ernst |quote=Cruyff is a family man (...), one of the few professional players who married young and kept his marriage alive over all these years. He also managed to keep himself, his wife and children away from the wrong kind of tabloid headlines. His son [[Jordi Cruyff|Jordi]] has praised Johan as a very considerate and playful father and that his childhood was a very happy one, although his father was away quite often. So, for Johan Cruyff his family may have been even more important than his football career...|date=23 April 2008 |accessdate=20 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Contrary to his well-known strong personality and superstar status, Cruyff led a relatively quiet private life beyond the world of football.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/sport/football/news-and-comment/johan-cruyff-the-balletic-genius-who-changed-football-a6951636.html |author=Herbert, Ian |title=Johan Cruyff: The balletic genius who changed football all over the world |publisher=Independent.co.uk |date=25 March 2016 |accessdate=25 August 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt; A highly principled, strong-minded and devoted family man, Cruyff's football career, both as a player and as a manager, was considerably influenced by his family, in particular his wife Danny.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.espnfc.com/story/528411/hard-to-explain |title=Hard to explain |publisher=ESPN FC |last=Bouwes |first=Ernst |quote=Then [[Carles Rexach]] published his book and also claimed that she [Danny] always had a big influence over his career. (...) She can also be blamed for [[Netherlands national football team|Holland]] missing out on the World Cup in 1970, and then probably winning it, why not, when Johan had to go on a trip to Milan with Danny to buy shoes for her shop in Amsterdam. He returned too late for the Dutch training camp before their decisive qualifier against Bulgaria and was subsequently dropped. A draw ended all hopes of a trip to Mexico. |date=23 April 2008 |accessdate=20 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.espnfc.com/story/905938/ernst-bouwes-cruyff-rift-tearing-ajax-apart |title=Cruyff rift tearing Ajax apart |publisher=ESPN FC |last=Bouwes |first=Ernst |quote=Following his heart operation in 1991, Danny became stricter in controlling her man. He withdrew as [Netherlands] national coach for the 1994 World Cup in a cloud of arguments after an initial agreement. She probably forbade him to go as it was too dangerous for his health. Several times since, Cruyff has promised to commit to some responsibility, only to resign later with some half-hearted excuse. It's as if she told him to stop being foolish, but he did not dare to say so in public. Danny appears to be very well capable of handling Cruyff. |date=12 April 2011 |accessdate=20 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; He and Danny had three children together: Chantal (16 November 1970), Susila (27 January 1972), and [[Jordi Cruyff|Jordi]] (9 February 1974). The family has lived in [[Barcelona]] since 1973, with a six-year interruption from December 1981 to January 1988 when they lived in [[Vinkeveen]], The Netherlands.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title='Grote Johan Cruijff-hype is in aantocht'|url=http://www.vi.nl/nieuws/grote-johan-cruijffhype-is-in-aantocht.htm|publisher=Voetbal International|date=25 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1977, Cruyff announced his decision to retire from international football at the age of 30, despite still being lean and wiry, after helping the country qualify for the [[1978 World Cup]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://thesefootballtimes.co/2015/12/01/in-celebration-of-hollands-underappreciated-1978-masters/ |author=Bland, Gareth |title=In celebration of Holland’s underappreciated 1978 masters |publisher=These Football Times (thesefootballtimes.co) |date=1 December 2015 |accessdate=31 August 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This move, shrouded in mystery and met with disbelief back in late 1977, was only finally stripped of its mystique in 2008, when Cruyff explained his decision in an interview with ''[[Catalunya Ràdio|Catalunya Radio]]''. It was while still living in Barcelona as a player in late 1977, Cruyff and his family became the victims of an armed attacker who forced his way into his flat in Barcelona.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dutchnews.nl/features/2016/04/johan-cruyff-x-14/ |title=14 things you may or may not know about Johan Cruijff |publisher=DutchNews.nl |quote=According to newspaper [http://www.ad.nl AD], the man, a labourer from Rotterdam, drove to Barcelona buying a sawn-off shot gun on the way. He forced Cruijff and his wife Danny to lie on the floor, bound Cruijff– who asked with admirable and typical sang-froid for the rope not to be tied too tightly because he’d just had an operation (which wasn’t true) – and held a gun to the footballer's head. Danny made a dash for the door and when her screams alerted neighbours the attacker fled, dropping his gun. After some fisticuffs with other residents he was handed over to the police and spent a couple of years in prison. Later Cruijff said the attempted kidnap was the reason he decided not to go to the World Cup in Argentina in 1978. |date=11 April 2016 |accessdate=20 July 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt; And the man who was then the ultimate football superstar was confronted with the choice between family values and a highly promising World Cup glory at the end of his international career. But for Cruyff, family comes first. In the interview with ''Catalunya Radio'', he said that the attempted kidnap was the reason he decided not to go to the World Cup in Argentina in 1978. As he recalled, "You should know that I had problems at the end of my career as a player here and I don't know if you know that someone [put] a rifle at my head and tied me up and tied up my wife in front of the children at our flat in Barcelona. The children were going to school accompanied by the police. The police slept in our house for three or four months. I was going to matches with a bodyguard. All these things change your point of view towards many things. There are moments in life in which there are other values. We wanted to stop this and be a little more sensible. It was the moment to leave football and I couldn't play in the World Cup after this."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/2008/apr/17/newsstory.sport |author=Keeley, Graham |title=After 30 years, the truth behind Cruyff's World Cup absence |work= The Guardian |date=17 April 2008 |accessdate=27 July 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Cruyff named his third child after the patron saint of [[Catalonia]], St Jordi, commonly known in English as [[Saint George]] of Lydda. This was seen as a provocative gesture towards the then Spanish dictator General Franco, who had made all symbols of Catalan nationalism illegal. Cruyff had to fly his son back to the Netherlands to register his birth as the name "Jordi" had been banned by the Spanish authorities. Cruyff's decision to go to such great lengths to support Catalan nationalism is part of the reason he is a hero to Barcelona supporters and Catalan nationalists.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Burns |first=Danny |title=Barca |year=2009 |publisher=Bloomsbury Publishing|location=London|isbn=978-1408805787}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Jordi Cruyff has played for teams such as Barcelona (while father Johan was manager), Manchester United, [[Deportivo Alavés|Alavés]] and [[RCD Espanyol|Espanyol]]. His grandson, [[Jesjua Angoy-Cruyff|Jesjua Angoy]], plays at [[Dayton Dutch Lions]]. The younger Cruyff wears "Jordi" on his shirt to distinguish himself from his famous father, which also reflects the common Spanish practice of referring to players by given names alone or by nicknames. It is also related to the commercial claim of "name and fame" of his father to the name Cruyff/Cruijff. Pep Guardiola, Ronald Koeman, and Joan Laporta were among Cruyff's closest friends.&lt;ref name="JLaporta"/&gt; Estelle Cruijff, a niece of Cruyff, was married to [[Ruud Gullit]] for 12 years (2000–2012).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.goal.com/en-india/news/2292/editorials/2012/08/02/3270714/the-good-life-ruud-gullit |author=Ghai, Rishabh |title=The Good Life: Ruud Gullit |publisher=Goal.com |date=2 August 2012 |accessdate=22 September 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.moroccoworldnews.com/2016/01/177961/badr-haris-partner-estelle-cruyff-converts-to-islam/ |title=Badr Hari's Ex-Partner Estelle Cruyff Allegedly Converts to Islam |work=MoroccoWorldNews |date=23 January 2016 |accessdate=23 September 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Political and religious views==
Cruyff once described himself as "not religious" and criticized the practices of devoutly Catholic Spanish players: "In Spain all 22 players make the [[sign of the cross]] before a game; if it worked, every game would be a tie."&lt;ref name=cruijff1&gt;{{cite web|title=Johan Cruijff Quotes|quote="I'm not religious, in Spain all 22 players cross themselves, if it works the game is always going to be a tie."|publisher=famousquotes.com|url=http://www.famousquotes.com/author/johan-cruijff|accessdate=9 July 2013|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131112085648/http://www.famousquotes.com/author/johan-cruijff/|archivedate=12 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; That widely quoted statement earned him a place on lists of the world's top [[atheist]] athletes. But in the 1990s, Cruyff told the Dutch Catholic radio station RKK/KRO that as a child he attended Sunday school, where he was taught about the Bible, and that while he didn’t go to church as an adult, he believed "there's something there."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.trouw.nl/tr/nl/5009/Archief/article/detail/2692345/1999/11/25/Verlosser-Cruijff-gelooft-niet-maar-denkt-wel-dat-er-iets-is.dhtml 'Verlosser' Cruijff gelooft niet, maar denkt wel dat er iets is (Trouw.nl, 25/11/99)]&lt;/ref&gt; The Dutch evangelical broadcaster EO posted an interview conducted before Cruyff's death with his friend [[Johan Derksen]], the editor-in-chief of ''[[Voetbal International]]'' magazine. "People don't know the real Johan Cruyff", Derksen said. "I have on occasion had beautiful conversations with him about faith, because we both went to the same kind of schools and learned about the Bible. And it stays with you."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eo.nl/geloven/nieuws/item/video-johan-cruijff-was-absoluut-gelovig/ |title=‘Johan Cruijff was absoluut gelovig’, Johan Derksen over voetballegende Cruijff |publisher= EO.nl |quote=[[Johan Derksen]]: "Johan [Cruijff] is absoluut gelovig, al gaat hij nooit naar de kerk".

Cruyff is also  said to have had an attachment to Jewish culture, having grown up in the Amsterdam municipal [[Betondorp]] populated by a sizeable Jewish community, and more prevalently because of his lifelong connections with [[AFC Ajax|Ajax Amsterdam]] – a football club with such strong Dutch Jewish influences that some have even dubbed it a "Jewish club".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thejc.com/arts/arts-features/102287/radio-review-ajax-jewish-club |author=Round, Simon |title=Radio review: Ajax – the Jewish club |publisher=The Jewish Chronicle |date=7 February 2013 |accessdate=20 July 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.rnw.org/archive/ajax-jewish-club-spite-itself |title=Ajax: a Jewish club in spite of itself |publisher=RNW Media ([[Radio Netherlands Worldwide]]) |accessdate=20 July 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/blogs/5live/entries/6ed72010-f201-3e7f-b2d2-c6f2a8dbb30a |author=Legard, Jonathan |title=BBC Blogs – The 5 live blog – Ajax – The Jewish club |publisher=BBC.co.uk |date=4 February 2013 |accessdate=20 July 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Writing in his weekly ''[[De Telegraaf]]'' column, Cruyff admitted, "Often the media are an additional tax, but the last week that has been different. The way in which a reply is posted via a variety of media in my situation, was emotional and heartwarming. I am extremely proud of the appreciation shown by all responses." On his condition, Cruyff added, "Meanwhile, we have to wait. It's really annoying that it has been leaked so quickly, because the only thing I know now is that I have lung cancer. No more.

He used to say that football should be played with the brain... I met him a few times after he left football, always playing golf, a sport he loved.

A friendly match between the Netherlands and France was held on the day after Cruyff's death. The play (at the [[Amsterdam Arena]]) was stopped in the 14th minute as players, staff, and supporters gave a minute's applause for Cruyff, who wore the number 14 shirt for his country. [[Mascots]] from both teams took to the pitch wearing Netherlands national team shirts adorned with Cruyff's number 14 on the front, while there were numerous banners in the spectators' stands bearing the simple message, "''Johan Bedankt''" ("Thank you Johan").&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/mar/25/johan-cruyff-tribute-holland-france-halted|title=Johan Cruyff tribute: Holland v France halted in 14th minute to honour legend|date=25 March 2016|work=The Guardian}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ahead of the [[El Clásico]] against Real Madrid (2 April 2016), Barcelona announced plans for five special tributes to the late club legend:
*1.) A [[mosaic]] formed by the 90,000 fans inside Camp Nou carrying the words 'Gràcies Johan' ([[Catalan language|Catalan]] for 'Thank you, Johan')
*2.) The words 'Gràcies Johan' would replace the World Club champions badge on the front of the Barcelona players' shirts
*3.) Children wearing T-shirts with the words 'Gràcies Johan' would accompany Barça's and Madrid's players on to the pitch at the beginning of the game. The logo of the [[Johan Cruyff Foundation]] would feature on the back of the T-shirts
*4.) The presence of all eight living (past and present) [[List of FC Barcelona presidents|Barcelona presidents]]: [[Agustí Montal Galobart]], [[Raimon Carrasco]], [[Josep Lluís Núñez]], [[Joan Gaspart]], [[Enric Reyna]], Joan Laporta, [[Sandro Rosell]] and [[Josep Maria Bartomeu]]

With him, both as a player and coach, we established our own style on the field, what is traditionally known as 'total football,' the Barça style everyone admires. The arrival of Cruyff altered the history of Barça. He contributed decisively to a change of mentality. He got us to keep our heads up and to see that no opponent was invincible, that we could attain what we were aiming for. Cruyff was an icon who explained, better than anyone, that Barça is more than a club. (...) Without Cruyff's unabashed and non-conformist spirit, we quite possibly wouldn't have become the greatest club in the world."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.fcbarcelona.com/club/news/2015-2016/letter-from-the-presidents-of-fc-barcelona-to-johan-cruyff |title=Letter from the presidents of FC Barcelona to Johan Cruyff |publisher=WWW.FCBARCELONA.COM |date=24 March 2016 |accessdate=24 September 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.espnfc.com/spanish-primera-division/story/2836579/barcelona-and-xavi-thank-johan-cruyff-for-altering-history |author=Garcia, Adriana |title=Barcelona and Xavi thank Johan Cruyff for 'altering history' |publisher=ESPN FC |date=25 March 2016 |accessdate=25 September 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Former Israeli president and prime minister [[Shimon Peres]] paid tribute to Cruyff as a cultural figure and writing on ''[[Facebook]]'': "Johan was more than just a great soccer player. He was a role model who promoted world peace. He brought the values of education into the game of football and proved that on the field, everyone is equal – Jews, Muslims, and Christians – that running fast and playing well will lead to victory in spite of discrimination and racism. Your work promoting sport and peace gave hope to children and youth around the world."&lt;ref name="ShimonPeres"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.haaretz.com/israel-news/1.710786 |title=Shimon Peres Pays Tribute to Late Dutch Soccer Legend Johan Cruyff |work=Haaretz |date=24 March 2016 |accessdate=18 June 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Kimpton Hotel &amp; Restaurant Group Inc.''' is a [[San Francisco]], [[California]], based hotel and restaurant brand owned by the [[Intercontinental Hotels Group]] (IHG). Founded in 1981 by William (Bill) Kimpton and led by Chief Executive Officer Mike DeFrino, the group was the largest chain of [[boutique hotel]]s in the United States in 2011. It currently operates 65 hotels, all but the Kimpton Seafire Resort + Spa in [[Grand Cayman]], [[Cayman Islands]] and the Kimpton De Witt in [[Amsterdam]] are in the United States. New hotels have been announced for [[Toronto]], [[Indianapolis]], [[Los Angeles]],&lt;ref&gt;http://www.latimes.com/designla/la-design-la-peer-hotel-weho-20180327-story.html&lt;/ref&gt; [[Paris]], [[Grenada]], [[Bali]], [[Shanghai]], [[Sanya]], and [[Taipei]].{{when|date=May 2018}}

While most Kimpton properties are marketed under their own names as boutique hotels, the company launched two sub-brands in 2005, Hotel Palomar and Hotel Monaco. Each property has a restaurant or bar that is marketed as upscale or trendy. ''[[Fortune (magazine)|Fortune]]'' listed it as the #11 best company to work for in 2015.&lt;ref name="fortune2013"/&gt; The company also manages and operates hotels owned by other entitie under contract.

On December 16, 2014, IHG announced that it would acquire Kimpton for $430 million in cash.  IHG has retained the Kimpton brand name within the U.S. and may expand it globally.&lt;ref name=IHG&gt;{{cite press release| title=IHG agrees to acquire Kimpton Hotels &amp; Restaurants to create the world's largest boutique hotel business| url=http://www.ihgplc.com/index.asp?pageid=57&amp;newsid=3362| date=16 December 2014| accessdate=2014-12-15| publisher=Intercontinental Hotels Group| deadurl=yes| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141216112439/http://www.ihgplc.com/index.asp?pageid=57&amp;newsid=3362| archivedate=16 December 2014| df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Downey&gt;{{cite journal| title=IHG Acquires Kimpton for $430 Million| url=http://www.lodgingmagazine.com/ihg-acquires-kimpton-for-430-million/| first=Sean| last=Downey| date=15 December 2014| accessdate=2014-12-15| work=Lodging}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a result of the acquisition, seven of Kimpton's nine hotels in San Francisco left the brand in July 2015.

A '''legal person''' (in legal contexts often simply '''person''', less ambiguously '''legal entity''')&lt;ref&gt;[http://thelawdictionary.org/legal-entity/]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.law.cornell.edu/wex/entity]&lt;/ref&gt; is any human or non-human entity, in other words, any human being, firm, or government agency that is recognized as having privileges and obligations, such as having the ability to enter into contracts, to sue, and to be sued.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Contracts between Legal Persons|url=http://www.nber.org/papers/w16049|publisher=National Bureau of Economic Research|accessdate=7 June 2013|author=Lewis A.

The term "legal person" is however ambiguous because it is also used in contradistinction to "natural person", i.e. as a synonym of terms used to refer only to non-human legal entities.&lt;ref&gt;[http://thelawdictionary.org/juridical-person/]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.law.cornell.edu/wex/legal_person]&lt;/ref&gt;

So there are of two kinds of legal entities, human and non-human: [[natural person]]s (also called ''physical persons'') and [[juridical person]]s (also called ''juridic'', ''juristic'', ''artificial'', ''legal'', or ''fictitious persons'', {{lang-la|persona ficta}}), which are other entities (such as corporations) that are treated in law as if they were persons.&lt;ref name="oxdic" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Deiser|first=George F.|title=The Juristic Person.

While human beings acquire legal [[personhood]]  [[birth certificate|when they are born]] (or even before in [[Personhood#Beginning_of_personhood|some]] jurisdictions), juridical persons do so when they are [[Incorporation (business)|incorporated]] in accordance with law.

Legal personhood is a prerequisite to [[legal capacity]], the ability of any legal person to amend (enter into, transfer, etc.) rights and [[Law of obligations|obligations]].

In [[international law]], consequently, legal personality is a prerequisite for an [[international organization]] to be able to sign [[international treaties]] in its own [[Legal name|name]].

== Juridical persons ==
{{Main article|Juridical person}}

'''Artificial personality''', '''juridical personality''', or '''juristic personality''' is the characteristic of a non-living [[entity]] regarded by law to have the status of [[personhood]].

A '''juridical''' or '''artificial''' person ({{lang-la|'''persona ficta'''}}; also juristic person) has a [[Legal name (business)|legal name]] and has certain rights, protections, privileges, responsibilities, and [[legal liability|liabilities]] in law, similar to those of a [[natural person]]. The concept of a juridical person is a fundamental [[legal fiction]]. It is pertinent to the [[philosophy of law]], as it is essential to laws affecting a corporation ([[Corporate law|corporations law]]).

Juridical personhood allows one or more natural persons (''universitas personarum'') to act as a single entity (body corporate) for legal purposes. In many [[jurisdiction]]s, artificial personality allows that entity to be considered under law separately from its individual members (for example in a company limited by shares, its [[shareholder]]s). They may [[Lawsuit|sue and be sued]], enter contracts, incur [[debt]], and own [[property]]. Entities with legal personality may also be subjected to certain legal obligations, such as the payment of taxes. An entity with legal personality may [[Limited liability|shield its members]] from [[legal liability|personal liability]].

In some [[common law jurisdictions]] a distinction is drawn between ''corporation aggregate'' (such as a company, which has a number of members) and a ''[[corporation sole]]'' (which is where a person's public office is deemed to have a separate personality from them as an individual). Both have separate legal personality.  Historically most corporations sole were ecclesiastical in nature (for example, the [[Archbishop of Canterbury]] is a corporation sole), but a [[Corporation sole#Corporations sole in the United Kingdom|number of other public offices]] are now formed as corporations sole.

The concept of juridical personality is not absolute. "[[Piercing the corporate veil]]" refers to looking at the individual natural persons acting as [[Law of agency|agents]] involved in a [[corporate action|company action]] or decision; this may result in a legal decision in which the rights or duties of a corporation or [[public limited company]] are treated as the rights or liabilities of that corporation's members or [[Board of directors#Directors|director]]s.

The concept of a juridical person is now central to [[Western law]] in both [[common law|common-law]] and [[Civil law (legal system)|civil-law]] countries, but it is also found in virtually every legal system.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.jstor.org/pss/3313312 The Juristic Person. I], George F. Deiser, University of Pennsylvania Law Review and American Law Register, Vol. 57, No. 3, Volume 48 New Series. (Dec., 1908), pp. 131-142.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Examples ===
Some examples of juridical persons include:

*[[Cooperative]]s (co-ops), business organization owned and [[Democracy|democratically]] operated by a group of individuals for their mutual benefit
*[[Corporation]]s are bodies corporate created by statute or charter. A [[corporation sole]] is a corporation constituted by a single member, in a particular capacity, and that person's successors in the same capacity, in order to give them some [[legal benefit]] or advantage, particularly that of perpetuity, which a natural person could not have had. Examples are a religious officiant in that capacity, or [[The Crown]] in the [[Commonwealth realm]]s. A corporation aggregate is a corporation constituted by more than one member.
**[[Municipality|Municipal corporations]] (municipalities) are "creatures of [[statute]]". Other organizations may be created by statute as legal persons, including [[European economic interest grouping]]s (EEIGs).
*[[Voluntary association|Unincorporated associations]], that is aggregates of two or more persons, are treated as juridical persons in some jurisdictions but not others.
*[[Partnership]]s, an aggregate of two or more persons to carry on a business in common for profit and created by agreement. Traditionally, partnerships did not have continuing legal personality, but many jurisdictions now treat them as having an independent legal personality.
*[[Company|Companies]], a form of [[Companies law|business association]] that carries on an industrial enterprise, are often corporations, although companies may take other forms, such as [[trade union]]s, [[Unlimited company|unlimited companies]], [[Investment trust|trusts]], and [[Mutual fund|funds]]. [[Limited liability company|Limited liability companies]]—be they a [[private company limited by guarantee]], [[private company limited by shares]], or [[public limited company]]—are entities having certain characteristics of both a corporation and a partnership. Different types have a complex variety of advantages and disadvantages.&lt;ref name=Complexity&gt;Frisch D. (2011). [http://www.georgemasonlawreview.org/doc/Frisch_18-2_2011.pdf Commercial Law's Complexity] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140203195016/http://www.georgemasonlawreview.org/doc/Frisch_18-2_2011.pdf |date=February 3, 2014 }}. ''George Mason Law Review''.&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[Sovereign state]]s are legal persons.
*In the [[international legal system]], various organizations possess legal personality. These include [[intergovernmental organizations]] (the United Nations, the [[Council of Europe]]) and some other [[international organization]]s (including the [[Sovereign Military Order of Malta]], a [[religious order]]).
*The [[European Union]] (EU) has legal personality since the [[Lisbon Treaty]] entered into force on 1 December 2009. That the EU has legal personality is a prerequisite for [[Relationship between the European Court of Justice and European Court of Human Rights#EU accession to ECHR|the EU to join the European Convention on Human Rights (ECHR)]]. However, in 2014, the EU decided not to be bound by the rulings of the [[European Court of Human Rights]].&lt;ref&gt;Opinion 2/13 [2014], nyr [http://curia.europa.eu/juris/document/document.jsf?doclang=EN&amp;text=&amp;pageIndex=0&amp;part=1&amp;mode=DOC&amp;docid=160882&amp;occ=first&amp;dir=&amp;cid=240894]&lt;/ref&gt;
*Temples, in some legal systems, have separate legal personality.&lt;ref&gt;''Williams v The Shipping Corporation of India'' (US District Court, Eastern District Virginia), 10 March 1980, 63 ILR 363&lt;/ref&gt;
* The [[Whanganui River]] was granted legal personality in March 2017 under [[New Zealand]] law because the Whanganui [[Māori people|Māori]] tribe regard the river as their ancestor.&lt;ref name="roy-2017"&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;
* Also, in March 2017, the [[Uttarakhand High Court|High Court of Uttarakhand]] declared the [[Ganges|Ganges River]] a  legal "person" in a move that according to one newspaper, "could help in efforts to clean the pollution-choked rivers". As of 6 April 2017, the ruling has been commented on in [[India]]n newspapers to be hard to enforce, with assertions that experts{{who|date=July 2017}} do not anticipate immediate benefits, that the ruling is "hardly game changing", that experts{{who|date=July 2017}} believe "any follow-up action is unlikely", and that the "judgment is deficient to the extent it acted without hearing others (in states outside [[Uttarakhand]]) who have stakes in the matter".{{citation needed|date=July 2017}}

Not all organizations have legal personality. For example, the board of directors of a corporation, legislature, or governmental agency typically are not legal persons in that they have no ability to exercise legal rights independent of the corporation or political body which they are a part of.

== History ==
The concept of legal personhood for organizations of people is at least as old as [[Ancient Rome]]: a variety of  [[Collegium (ancient Rome)|collegial institutions]] enjoyed the benefit under [[Roman law]].

The doctrine has been attributed to [[Pope Innocent IV]], who seems at least to have helped spread the idea of ''persona ficta'' as it is called in Latin. In [[canon law (Catholic Church)|canon law]], the doctrine of ''persona ficta'' allowed monasteries to have a legal existence that was apart from the monks, simplifying the difficulty in balancing the need for such groups to have infrastructure though the monks took vows of personal poverty.  Another effect of this was that as a fictional person, a monastery could not be held guilty of [[delict]] due to not having a soul, helping to protect the organization from non-contractual obligations to surrounding communities.  This effectively moved such liability to individuals acting within the organization while protecting the structure itself, since individuals were considered to have a soul and therefore capable of being guilty of negligence and excommunicated.&lt;ref&gt;John Dewey, “The Historic Background of Corporate Legal Personality,” Yale Law Journal, Vol. XXXV, April 1926, pages 655-673&lt;/ref&gt;

In the common law tradition, only a person could sue or be sued. This was not a problem in the era before the [[Industrial Revolution]], when the typical business venture was either a [[sole proprietorship]] or [[partnership]]—the owners were simply liable for the debts of the business. A feature of the corporation, however, is that the owners/shareholders enjoyed [[limited liability]]—the owners were ''not'' liable for the debts of the company. Thus, when a corporation breached a contract or broke a law, there was no remedy, because limited liability protected the owners and the corporation wasn't a legal person subject to the law. There was no accountability for corporate wrongdoing.

To resolve the issue, the legal personality of a corporation was established to include five legal rights—the right to a common treasury or chest (including the right to own property), the right to a corporate seal (i.e., the right to make and sign contracts), the right to sue and be sued (to enforce contracts), the right to hire agents (employees) and the right to make by-laws (self-governance).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/892043129|title=Textbook on legal methods, legal systems and research|last=Kanti.|first=Saha, Tushar|isbn=9788175348936|oclc=892043129}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since the 19th century, legal personhood has been further construed to make it a citizen, resident, or domiciliary of a state (usually for purposes of [[personal jurisdiction]]). In ''Louisville, C. &amp; C.R. Co. v. Letson'', 2 How. 497, 558, 11 L.Ed. 353 (1844), the U.S. Supreme Court held that for the purposes of the case at hand, a corporation is "capable of being treated as a citizen of [the State which created it], as much as a natural person." Ten years later, they reaffirmed the result of Letson, though on the somewhat different theory that "those who use the corporate name, and exercise the faculties conferred by it," should be presumed conclusively to be citizens of the corporation's State of incorporation. Marshall v. Baltimore &amp; Ohio R. Co., 16 How. 314, 329, 14 L.Ed. 953 (1854). These concepts have been codified by statute, as U.S. jurisdictional statutes specifically address the domicile of corporations.

== Sample cases using the doctrine ==
* In ''U.S. v. The Cooper Corp.'', (1941) the court held that the United States government, as a juristic person, could sue under the [[Sherman Act]]. Section 7 of the act granted the right to sue only to persons. The corporate defendant, which was accused of illegally conspiring and colluding to raise prices on [[tire]]s, argued that the U.S. government didn't have power to enforce the act because the government wasn't a person. The court held that the term "person" includes the U.S. Government, and allowed the action against the collusive corporations to continue.
* In ''Cook County v. U.S. ex rel Chandler'', (2003) the County was accused of violating a law which forbids "any person" from falsely obtaining research funds from the government. The county received a $5 million grant, but used it to conduct inappropriate tests on human subjects. The county argued that it could not be held liable because it was not a person. The court held that the county could be sued under the law as a legal person.
* In ''Rowland v. California Men's Colony, Unit II Men's Advisory Council'', (1993) the court declined to extend certain rights to legal persons. The association of prisoners sought to proceed ''[[in forma pauperis]].'' The court held that the right to sue ''in forma pauperis'' existed only for natural persons, not legal persons.

== Extension of basic rights to legal persons ==

=== Brazil ===
The term juridical person ("pessoa jurídica" in [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]]) is used in [[legal science]] for designating an entity with rights and liabilities which also has legal personality. Its regulations are largely based on Brazil's Civil Code, where it is distinctly recognized and defined, among other normative documents.

[[Brazilian law]] recognizes any association or abstract entity as a juridical person, but a registry is required through a Constitutional Document, with specifications depending on the category of Juridical Person and local law of state and city.

=== Germany ===
Article 19(3) of the [[Basic Law for the Federal Republic of Germany|German Constitution]] sets forth: "Fundamental rights shall also apply to domestic artificial persons insofar as the nature of such rights shall permit."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iuscomp.org/gla/statutes/GG.htm#19|title=Basic Law. Art. 19 Abs. 3 GG|publisher=|accessdate=15 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Italy ===
In Italy [[trade unions]] have legal personality, as stated in Article 39, Paragraph 4 of the [[Italian Constitution|Constitution]]:

{{quote|Registered trade unions are legal persons. They may, through a unified representation that is proportional to their membership, enter into collective labour agreements that have a mandatory effect for all persons belonging to the categories referred to in the agreement. |source=The Italian Constitution&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Italian Constitution |url=http://www.quirinale.it/page/costituzione|publisher=The official website of the Presidency of the Italian Republic |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161127152449/http://www.quirinale.it/qrnw/costituzione/pdf/costituzione_inglese.pdf |archivedate=2016-11-27 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

=== New Zealand ===
Section 28 of the [[New Zealand Bill of Rights Act 1990]] provides: "... the provisions of this Bill of Rights apply, so far as practicable, for the benefit of all legal persons as well as for the benefit of all natural persons."

=== People's Republic of China ===
For a typical example of the concept of legal person in a civil law jurisdiction, under the [[General Principles of the Civil Law of the People's Republic of China|General Principles of Civil Law of the People's Republic of China]], Chapter III, Article 36., "A legal person shall be an organization that has capacity for civil rights and capacity for civil conduct and independently enjoys civil rights and assumes civil obligations in accordance with the law."&lt;ref&gt;Gary J. Dernelle. "DIRECT FOREIGN INVESTMENT AND CONTRACTUAL RELATIONS IN THE PEOPLE'S
REPUBLIC OF CHINA." DePaul Business Law Journal, Spring/Summer 1994. (6 DePaul Bus. L.J. 331)&lt;/ref&gt; Note however that the term [[civil right]] means something altogether different in civil law jurisdictions than in common law jurisdictions.

=== United States ===
In part based on the principle that legal persons are simply organizations of natural persons, and in part based on the history of statutory interpretation of the word "person", the US Supreme Court has repeatedly held that certain constitutional rights protect legal persons ([[Corporate personhood|such as corporations]] and other organizations). ''[[Santa Clara County v. Southern Pacific Railroad]]'' is sometimes cited for this finding because the court reporter's comments included a statement the Chief Justice made before oral arguments began, telling the attorneys during pre-trial that "the court does not wish to hear argument on the question whether the provision in the [[Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Fourteenth Amendment to the Constitution]], which forbids a State to deny any person within its jurisdiction the [[equal protection]] of the laws, applies to these corporations. We are all of the opinion that it does."

Later opinions interpreted these pre-argument comments as part of the legal decision.&lt;ref&gt;See, for example, [http://caselaw.lp.findlaw.com/scripts/getcase.pl?court=US&amp;vol=147&amp;invol=165 Noble v. Union River Logging]&lt;/ref&gt; As a result, because of the [[First Amendment to the United States Constitution|First Amendment]], Congress may not make a law restricting the free speech of a corporation or a political action group or dictating the coverage of a local newspaper,&lt;ref&gt;First Nat. Bank of Boston v. Bellotti&lt;/ref&gt; and because of the [[Due Process Clause]], a state government may not take the property of a corporation without using due process of law and providing just compensation. These protections apply to all legal entities, not just corporations.

A prominent component of relevant case law is the [[Supreme Court of the United States|Supreme Court]] decision ''[[Citizens United v. Federal Election Commission]]'', which ruled unconstitutional certain restrictions on corporate campaign spending during elections.&lt;ref&gt;http://origin.www.supremecourt.gov/docket/08-205.htm {{Dead link|date=May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Popular culture ==

In Act II, Scene 1 of [[Gilbert and Sullivan]]'s ''[[The Gondoliers]]'', Giuseppe Palmieri (who serves, jointly with his brother Marco, as King of Barataria) requests that he and his brother be also recognized individually so that they might each receive individual portions of food as they have "two independent appetites". He is, however, turned down by the Court (made up of fellow Gondolieri) because the joint rule "... is a legal person, and legal person are solemn things."

'''Lilienthal Gliding Medal''' – the highest soaring award in the world, established by [[Fédération Aéronautique Internationale]] (FAI) in 1938 in honor of [[Otto Lilienthal]], a [[Germany|German]] pioneer of human [[aviation]]. It aims "to reward a particularly remarkable performance in [[gliding]], or eminent services to the sport of gliding over a long period of time". The award is made at the annual FAI General Conference.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.ssa.org/myhome.asp?mbr=7262842059&amp;show=blog&amp;id=812#Lilienthal|title= SSA Awards and SSA Recognized Awards - International Awards|publisher= Soaring Society of America |accessdate= 2011-02-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Medal was designed by [[Austria]]n artist Josef Humplik.

The first winner of the Lilienthal Gliding Medal in the world was [[Tadeusz Góra]] for his record-breaking 577.8-kilometer flight on May 18, 1938, glider PWS-101 from [[Bezmiechowa Górna|Bezmiechowa]] to [[Šalčininkai|Soleczniki]] (near [[Vilnius]]).

The Medal is awarded by a vote of the Delegates to the [[FAI Gliding Commission|International Gliding Commission]] at the annual Plenary in March. In 2012 it was decided to end the practice of awarding the Medal for accomplishments of the previous calendar year, and to associate the Medal with the year in which the recipient is determined.  Consequently, the year 2013 does not appear in the table below.

'''Maurice Nathan Saatchi, Baron Saatchi''' ({{lang-ar|موريس ساعتجي}} ; born 21 June 1946) is a British businessman, and with his brother, [[Charles Saatchi|Charles]], co-founder of the [[advertising]] agencies [[Saatchi and Saatchi]] and [[M&amp;C Saatchi]].

== Biography ==

=== Early life ===
Maurice Saatchi is the third of four sons born to [[Nathan Saatchi]] and Daisy Ezer, a wealthy [[Iraqi Jewish]] family in [[Baghdad]], [[Iraq]].  Maurice's brothers are David (born 1937), [[Charles Saatchi|Charles Nathan]] (born 1943) and Philip (born 1953).{{sfn|Goldman|1997}} Nathan was a successful textile merchant and in 1947, he pre-empted a flight that tens of thousands of Iraqi Jews would soon make to avoid persecution and relocated his family to [[Finchley]]&lt;ref name="times2009"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://entertainment.timesonline.co.uk/tol/arts_and_entertainment/visual_arts/article5817312.ece|title=The Saturday interview: Charles Saatchi|last=Thomson|first=Alice |author2=[[Rachel Sylvester]]  |date=28 February 2009|publisher=Times Online|accessdate=24 November 2009 | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[London]].&lt;ref name="bbc2002"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/in_depth/uk/2000/newsmakers/2124645.stm|title=Charles Saatchi: Artful adman|last=Jones|first=Chris |date=12 July 2002|publisher=BBC News|accessdate=24 November 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nathan purchased two textile mills in north London and after a time re-built a thriving business.  Eventually the family would settle into a house with eight bedrooms on Hampstead Lane in [[Highgate]].{{sfn|Goldman|1997}}

Saatchi attended [[Tollington School|Tollington Grammar]] and graduated from the [[London School of Economics]] with a [[First class honours degree]] in Sociology in 1967.{{sfn|Goldman|1997}} His first job was at [[Haymarket Group|Haymarket Publications]] where Maurice would form valuable relationships with [[Michael Heseltine]], the Group Managing Director and with staff at the Haymarket's leading trade weekly for the ad industry ''Campaign''.  He spent three years at Haymarket as Creative Director before leaving to join his brother Charles' fledgling ad agency.

=== Advertising career ===
In 1970, Saatchi, with his brother, formed the advertising agency Saatchi and Saatchi.  They are credited with a number of successful advertising campaigns, most notably the "[[Labour Party (UK)|Labour]] isn't working" posters on behalf of the [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative Party]] for the [[United Kingdom general election, 1979|1979 British general election]] and advertisements for the [[cigarette]] brand [[Silk Cut]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.alastairmcintosh.com/images/silkcut.htm Silk Cut Cigarette Advertisements].&lt;/ref&gt; Maurice Saatchi served as chairman of the firm which became the world's largest advertising agency.&lt;ref name="BBC profile"&gt;{{cite news

| accessdate = 1 August 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, a shareholder revolt in 1994 ended the brothers' role in the company, and they founded a new company, [[M&amp;C Saatchi]], the following year. The new company has also been described as a success.&lt;ref name="BBC profile"/&gt;

=== Political career ===
Maurice Saatchi was created a [[life peer]] as '''Baron Saatchi''', of [[Staplefield]] in the [[West Sussex|County of West Sussex]] on 4 October 1996.&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette |issue=54547 |date=9 October 1996 |page=13389}}&lt;/ref&gt; He sits in the [[House of Lords]] as a [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative]]. Under the leadership of [[Iain Duncan Smith]], Saatchi served as shadow Treasury spokesman in the Lords, forming a close relationship with [[Michael Howard]], who was [[Shadow Chancellor of the Exchequer]]. Saatchi argued for the simplification of the tax system and that the poorest eight million people in the United Kingdom should not pay [[income tax]].&lt;ref name="BBC profile"/&gt; In June 2014, he suggested that small businesses should pay no corporate tax and that investors in said small businesses should pay no capital gains tax in order to "challenge cartel capitalism."&lt;ref&gt;Peter Dominiczak, [https://www.telegraph.co.uk/finance/personalfinance/consumertips/tax/10904385/Lord-Saatchi-Cut-corporation-tax-for-small-businesses.html Lord Saatchi: Cut corporation tax for small businesses], ''[[The Daily Telegraph]]'', June 16, 2014&lt;/ref&gt;

After Howard became leader of the Conservatives in November 2003, Saatchi was appointed joint chairman of the party with [[Liam Fox]]. He had responsibility for running the party campaign for the [[United Kingdom general election, 2005|2005 general election]], after which he stepped down.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

Among his failings listed in the document, Saatchi highlighted the following:

:* ''I DID NOT convince the Party that if you don't stand for something, you'll fall for anything.''
:* ''I DID NOT dispel the illusion of research, which said that, as immigration was the number one issue in deciding how people vote, it should be the number one topic.''
:* ''I DID NOT prevent economics, the Conservatives' former ace of trumps, becoming a 'second order issue.'''
:* ''I DID NOT avoid the underestimation of public intelligence, as in the policy description 'Lower Taxes' when in fact taxes would be higher.''

He recommended that future Conservative leaders establish a "moral purpose" as an ideology and future direction for the Party.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

| accessdate = 1 August 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Following the death of his wife [[Josephine Hart]] to [[ovarian cancer]], Maurice Saatchi has campaigned for a change to the UK law which, he believes, holds doctors back from using innovative treatments because they fear litigation. His [[Medical Innovation Bill]] was formally introduced in 2013 and was co-adopted by the government in its passage through parliament.&lt;ref name=appeal&gt;{{cite news |newspaper=Daily Telegraph |title=Lord Saatchi's personal appeal |author= |authorlink= |date=26 January 2014 |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/health/news/10595475/Lord-Saatchis-personal-appeal.html |accessdate=7 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The bill has enjoyed some popular support and favourable press coverage, but has drawn a critical response from some medical and legal bodies, patient groups and charities.&lt;ref name=ross&gt;{{cite news |newspaper=Daily Telegraph |title=The 'Saatchi Bill': can a PR guru cure cancer? |author=Ross N |authorlink=Nick Ross |date=2 June 2014 |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/health/saatchi-bill/10870505/The-Saatchi-Bill-can-a-PR-guru-cure-cancer.html |accessdate=7 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=flap&gt;{{cite news |newspaper=The Guardian |url=https://www.theguardian.com/science/brain-flapping/2014/nov/19/saatchi-bill-medical-innovation |title=Attacking critics is no way to fix the Saatchi bill |date=19 November 2014 |accessdate=7 February 2015 |author=Hills D}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Other roles ==
He is also chairman of the [[Finsbury Food Group plc]], and is a Governor of the [[London School of Economics]]. Saatchi is a trustee of the [[Museum of Garden History]], and also a director of the [[Centre for Policy Studies]].  He was also a trustee of the [[Victoria and Albert Museum]] from 1988 to 1996.

He is a previous recipient of St. George’s Society of New York's Medal of Honour, an award established in 1996 which recognizes those who have rendered exemplary service to British interests and/or the international community at large.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.stgeorgessociety.org/honorees/ St. George Society of New York Honorees&lt;/ref&gt;

==Philanthropy==
He and his brother founded the [[Saatchi Shul]], an independent [[Orthodox Jewish]] synagogue in [[Maida Vale]], London, England, in 1998.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=xdkOA9Ed7H4C&amp;pg=PA60 |title=Fiddler on the Move: Exploring the Klezmer World Book &amp; CD |author=Mark Slobin |publisher=Oxford University Press |date=2003 |accessdate=17 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=4dFCmia8VnIC&amp;pg=PA115 |title=The Jewish People Policy Planning Institute Planning Assessment, 2004–2005: The Jewish People Between Thriving and Decline |publisher=Gefen Publishing House Ltd |date= 2005|accessdate=17 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Personal life ==
Saatchi's first wife was Gillian Osband, a children's book editor and writer whom he had known since childhood and whom he married in 1972. They divorced in 1984 and that same year he married the novelist [[Josephine Hart]] (1942–2011), whom he first met when they worked together at [[Haymarket Group|Haymarket Publications]] in 1967.&lt;ref name="BBC profile"/&gt; She died on 2 June 2011.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/obituaries/culture-obituaries/film-obituaries/8555567/Josephine-Hart.html Obituaries: Josephine Hart], ''[[The Daily Telegraph|The Telegraph]]'', 3 June 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

His country property is a mock Tudor castle called Old Hall in [[Staplefield]], [[West Sussex]], built in 1842. There are sixty acres of parkland and ten acres of flowers, trees and lakes. Maurice Saatchi has a fondness for gardening, laid out the garden on the estate and built a conservatory to house semi-tropical plants. The property was the subject of a display article in ''Architectural Digest'' in January 1995.{{sfn|Goldman|1997}}

Maurice Saatchi and his brother Charles were listed at number 366 in the [[Sunday Times Rich List 2008]], with an estimated wealth of £220m in advertising and art.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thesundaytimes.co.uk/sto/business/BusinessRichList/article85450.ece Rich List: Maurice, Lord Saatchi and Charles Saatchi], ''[[The Sunday Times]]'', 27 April 2008&lt;/ref&gt; In the [[Sunday Times Rich List 2009]] they were listed at number 438.&lt;ref&gt;[http://business.timesonline.co.uk/tol/business/specials/rich_list/rich_list_2009/article6164162.ece Rich List: Lord Saatchi and Charles Saatchi], ''[[The Sunday Times]]'', 29 April 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Michael Clifford "Mike" Fitzpatrick''' (born 28 January 1953) is an Australian businessman, sporting administrator and former professional [[Australian rules football]] player. He was chairman of the [[AFL Commission]] (football's governing body) from 2007 to 2017.

Fitzpatrick was raised in [[Perth]] and began his football career with {{WAFL Sub}} in the [[West Australian Football League]] (WAFL). A [[Ruckman (Australian rules football)|ruckman]], he played 97 games for the club between 1970 and 1974, playing in a premiership team [[1973 WANFL season|in 1973]] and winning the club's [[best and fairest]] award in his last two seasons. Fitzpatrick transferred to the [[Victorian Football League]] (VFL) for the [[1975 VFL season|1975 season]] and represented {{AFL Car}} until his retirement at the end of the [[1983 VFL season|1983 season]]. He played in premierships in 1979, 1981, and 1982, and captained the club from 1980 to 1983. Fitzpatrick also represented both [[Western Australia Australian rules football team|Western Australia]] and [[Victoria Australian rules football team|Victoria]] in [[Interstate matches in Australian rules football|interstate matches]].

A graduate of the [[University of Western Australia]], Fitzpatrick interrupted his football career to study at [[St. John's College, Oxford]], on a [[Rhodes Scholarship]]. After retiring from football he worked for the [[Department of Treasury and Finance (Victoria)|Victorian Treasury Department]], and later worked in investment banking and funds management. Outside his commercial interests, Fitzpatrick served on the board of the Carlton Football Club from 1989 to 1995, and as chairman of the [[Australian Sports Commission]] from 1994 to 1997. He was appointed to the AFL Commission in 2003, and in 2007 replaced [[Ron Evans]] as its chairman. He retired from the position of chairman in April 2017 and was replaced by [[Richard Goyder]].

The club lost consecutive finals in 1980, but subsequently won two premierships in two years, something they had not done since 1914/1915. Fitzpatrick was runner-up to [[Bruce Doull]] in the 1981 [[Norm Smith Medal]] and kicked two goals in the [[1982 VFL Grand Final|1982 Grand Final]]. He missed several matches due to injury [[1983 VFL season|in 1983]], and announced his retirement at the end of the season in order to concentrate on his business career.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.blueseum.org/tiki-index.php?page=Mike+Fitzpatrick Mike Fitzpatrick], Blueseum.

He played his first full matches the following season, against Victoria at [[VFL Park]] and against South Australia at [[Subiaco Oval]]. He also played two state games in 1974, one of which was a narrow seven-point loss to Victoria in which he kicked two goals. After moving to the VFL in 1975, Fitzpatrick's appearances for Western Australia became less frequent. He returned to the state team for the [[1979 Perth State of Origin Carnival]] (after five years' absence), and made an additional five appearances over the next three years.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wafooty.com.au/download/d/_8Jl6zdxtlIXj_S5PS4HYFOcVVXH_UFDJSLWItOpo-E State Games 1951 - 2011], West Australian Football Commission.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3567">'''Mitumba''' is a [[Swahili language|Swahili]] term, literally meaning "bundles", used to refer to plastic-wrapped packages of used clothing donated by people in wealthy countries. The term is also applied to the clothing that arrives in these bundles.

One major receiving port for Mitumba is in the [[Tanzanian]] city of [[Dar es Salaam]]. From there the clothing is widely dispersed into the interior of Africa. The transportation and sale of Mitumba is responsible for many jobs both in wealthy donor companies and in the African countries where Mitumba is bought and sold. Critics of the Mitumba trade note that the influx of cheap clothing is responsible for the decline of local [[textile]] industries.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.economist.com/news/middle-east-and-africa/21695819-governments-take-aim-well-meaning-foreigners-east-africas-used-clothes-trade|title=East Africa’s used-clothes trade comes under fire|website=The Economist|access-date=2017-07-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; Proponents of Mitumba point out that the clothing is beneficial in that it stimulates economic activity and allows people with limited means to afford fashionable clothing.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.spiegel.de/spiegel/print/d-45280028.html|title=GLOBALISIERUNG: Das Hemd des toten Weißen - DER SPIEGEL 2/2006|last=Germany|first=SPIEGEL ONLINE, Hamburg,|website=www.spiegel.de|language=de|access-date=2017-07-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Mitumba is usually packaged in plastic bundles prior to transport to [[Africa]]. Most of the Mitumba originates in developed countries such as the United States. Companies like Mid-West Textile Company of [[Texas]] purchase clothes that were donated to non-profit organizations such as [[Goodwill Industries]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.alternet.org/world/do-african-nations-want-your-second-hand-clothes-yes-and-no|title=Do African Nations Want Your Second-Hand Clothes? Yes and No|last=gloriasb|date=2017-07-05|work=AlterNet|access-date=2017-07-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; These clothes are then put into a conveyor belt and workers sort through them before making the bales or packages to be shipped to [[Africa]]. The practice of purchasing and the subsequent sale of clothes that were originally acquired as donations has received heavy criticism. However, defendants of the practice argue that not-for-profits organizations receive such large quantities of donations that they must indeed sell them in order to fund the several social projects they are involved with. The defendants go even further as to argue that if non-profit organizations were not able to sell most of their donations, they would not be able to survive nor fulfill their mission statements of helping the disadvantaged. The industry is one of the topics covered by professor [[Pietra Rivoli]] in her best-selling book, ''The Travels of a T-Shirt in the Global Economy''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=0bdUHkbEZqQC&amp;lpg=PA227&amp;dq=mitumba&amp;pg=PA224#v=onepage&amp;q=mitumba&amp;f=false|title=The Travels of a T-Shirt in the Global Economy: An Economist Examines the Markets, Power, and Politics of World Trade|last=Rivoli|first=Pietra|date=2009-04-01|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons|isbn=9780470456422|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the show, he became the center of a controversy when he said he was a victim of "racist remarks" (he has black skin) of [[Marielle Goitschel]], who in turn claimed  to have treated him as "just a shrimp" (''minus'' in French).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lefigaro.fr/actualite/2006/05/02/01001-20060502ARTWWW90384-richard_virenque_gagne_je_suis_une_celebrite_sortez_moi_de_la.php Richard Virenque wins "I am a disaster, get me out of here"] , ''[[Le Figaro]],'' 15 October 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; The French media became interested in him, so he participated in several shows like ''Capital'', which highlighted his personality, and ''Zone interdite'' on M6. He participated in the talk shows of Marc-Olivier Fogiel, [[Jean-Marc Morandini]], and [[Laurent Ruquier]].

He organized the [[Miss Europe]] competition with [[Endemol]], initially presented on [[TF1]], but the channel decided to sell it.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.toutelatele.com/article.php3?id_article=6454 Miss France / Europe Miss: No more!] , ''TouteLaTélé,''  7 February 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

In October 2006, he released a book, ''Mystères, scandales et... fortune'' (Mysteries, Scandals and... Fortune). The same year, he released his autobiography with a deliberately provocative title ''Omar Harfouch: Confessions of a millionaire'', in which he sets things straight with the French "celebrity scene" and the so-called "presse people".

The '''Paddington Waterside''' Partnership is the body coordinating regeneration of the Paddington Special Policy Area around [[Paddington Station]] in [[London]]. The project covers an area almost the size of [[Soho]], creating about {{convert|10000000|sqft|m2}} of space between 1998 and 2018.

It consists of 13 individual projects in the triangle of land between [[Praed Street]], Westbourne Terrace and the A40 [[Westway (London)|Westway]], most notably PaddingtonCentral&lt;!-- no space --&gt; and [[Paddington Basin]]. In 2000, the ''Independent'' described it as "the largest central London redevelopment scheme since the Second World War".&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | title=Paddington project given green light | first=Saeed | last=Shah | date=18 October 2000 | url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/business/news/paddington-project-given-green-light-635682.html | location=London | work=The Independent}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
[[File:One-three-kingdom-street.jpg|thumb|One and Three Kingdom Street from the south.]]
The Paddington Arm of the [[Grand Junction Canal]] opened on 10 July 1801,&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | title=The Union magazine, and imperial register, Volume 2 | publisher =J. Walker | year=1801 | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=JWcAAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA67 | page=67}}&lt;/ref&gt; linking Paddington to the Bull's Bridge junction near the future site of [[Heathrow Airport]]. The Grand Junction (now part of the [[Grand Union Canal]]) was the final link in a chain of canals that reduced the distance from London to Birmingham from {{convert|269.5|mi|km|0}} in 1789 to {{convert|138.5|mi|km|0}} in 1805;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | title=Transport in the industrial revolution | first1=Derek Howard  | last1= Aldcroft | first2=Michael J. | last2=Freeman | publisher = Manchester University Press | year=1983 | isbn=978-0-7190-0839-9 | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=tX27AAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA108 | page=108}}&lt;/ref&gt; terminating the canal at Paddington gave easy access to main roads into London and the level route meant no [[lock (water transport)|locks]] were needed on its {{convert|13.5|mi|km|0|adj=on}} length. In contrast the [[Regent's Canal]] needed 12 locks for the {{convert|86|ft|m|adj=on}} descent from Paddington to the Thames at Limehouse.

The canal was an instant success, with warehouses and housing springing up around it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title=The Victoria history of the county of Middlesex | year=1911 | first=William | last=Page | volume=2 | publisher=Constable | location=London | url=https://archive.org/details/middlesexhistory02univuoft | page=122}}&lt;/ref&gt; Canal traffic increased further when the Regent's Canal linked Paddington to the [[Port of London]] in 1820, but Paddington Basin was "practically killed" as a port&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title=London's Coats of Arms and the Stories They Tell | first=Richard | last=Crosley | year=1928 | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=-zqSQ9K1gN4C&amp;pg=PA164 | page=164}}&lt;/ref&gt; as business was lost to wharves such as [[City Road Basin]] that were closer to the docks and the [[City of London]]. Paddington regained importance as a transport interchange with the arrival of the railway in 1838.

Canal traffic transferred to the railways during the nineteenth century and fell away completely after World War II; the closure of the [[Regent's Canal Dock]] in 1969 marked the [[coup de grâce]]. A similar switch from rail to road [[History of rail transport in Great Britain 1948–1994|in the second half of the twentieth century]] left the Paddington goods yards redundant by the early 1980s. The land became derelict, with no public access to the canal land until 1987.&lt;ref name=McGhie&gt;{{cite news | title=The new arrivals at Paddington | first=Caroline | last=McGhie | url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/property/4814516/The-new-arrivals-at-Paddington.html | work=[[The Daily Telegraph]] |date=13 May 2001 | accessdate=29 October 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Paddington Special Policy Area was designated in 1988.&lt;ref name=factsheet&gt;{{cite web | title=Paddington Special Policy Area Factsheet | url=http://www3.westminster.gov.uk/docstores/publications_store/Paddington_Area_Factsheet_May_2009.pdf | publisher=Planning &amp; City Development Department, City of Westminster | date=May 2009 | accessdate=29 October 2010 | format=pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Paddington Regeneration Partnership, later the Paddington Waterside Partnership, was formed in 1998 to coordinate the regeneration of the area,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=Paddington Waterside Partnership | url=http://www.paddingtonwaterside.co.uk/ | publisher=Paddington Waterside Partnership | year=2008 | accessdate=29 October 2010}} (Official website)&lt;/ref&gt; now designated as the Paddington Special Policy Area.

[[File:Paddington-central.jpg|thumb|upright|Two Kingdom Street from the north]]
Bishop's Bridge station, the original London passenger terminus of the [[Great Western Railway]] was on this site west of [[Bishop's Bridge]] Road. After Paddington was built, it was used for the railway's [[goods shed]]s until the 1980s. It is now a [[mixed-use development]], with offices, flats and retail units. Phase I is Sheldon Square which is named after Sir Joseph Sheldon, a Lord Mayor of London who in 1678 rebuilt what became the church of [[List of churches in the Diocese of London#Deanery of Westminster Paddington|St Mary's]] on Paddington Green.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | editor=C R Elrington |first1=T F T | last1=Baker | first2=Diane K | last2=Bolton | first3=Patricia E C |last3=Croot | year=1989 | pages=252–259 | title=Paddington: Churches | series=A History of the County of Middlesex, Hampstead, Paddington | volume=9 | accessdate=18 October 2010 | url=http://www.british-history.ac.uk/report.aspx?compid=22674}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sheldon Square has {{convert|630000|sqft|m2|abbr=on}} of built space&lt;ref name=PaddingtonCentral&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.paddingtonwaterside.co.uk/the-developments/paddingtoncentral/default.aspx | title=PaddingtonCentral | publisher=Paddington Waterside Partnership | accessdate=18 October 2010 | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110719022905/http://www.paddingtonwaterside.co.uk/the-developments/paddingtoncentral/default.aspx | archivedate=19 July 2011 | df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; built around a grass [[amphitheatre]] which features live music in summer.

The second phase of development lies to the west, along Kingdom Street. One Kingdom Street is  a {{convert|260000|sqft|m2|abbr=on}} office building completed in February 2008 and occupied by [[Misys]], [[Statoil]], [[MWB Group Holdings|MWB]] and [[Vodafone]].&lt;ref name=PaddingtonCentral /&gt; It was designed by [[Sheppard Robson]] and developed by Development Securities, Aviva Investors and [[Union Investment]].&lt;ref name=PaddingtonCentral /&gt; Two Kingdom Street was due for completion in spring 2010 with [[AstraZeneca]] as the first tenant and has {{convert|235000|sqft|m2|abbr=on}} of office space with {{convert|25000|sqft|m2|abbr=on}} of residential accommodation.&lt;ref name=PaddingtonCentral /&gt; It was designed by [[Kohn Pedersen Fox]] and developed by Development Securities, Aviva Investors and Quinlan Private.&lt;ref name=PaddingtonCentral /&gt; The Novotel London Paddington is a distinctive 206 bedroom hotel at Three Kingdom Street.&lt;ref name=PaddingtonCentral /&gt; The hotel was designed by Dexter Moren Associates and Kohn Pedersen Fox and opened in September 2008.&lt;ref name=PaddingtonCentral /&gt; It is a joint venture between Development Securities and Aviva Investors.&lt;ref name=PaddingtonCentral /&gt;

=== Paddington Basin and Merchant Square ===
[[File:PaddBasin.jpg|thumb|Paddington Basin]]
{{main|Paddington Basin}}
Most of the land north of the canal basin is being developed under the banner of Merchant Square by European Land and Property as part of a joint venture between Simon and David Reuben (the [[Reuben brothers]]) and the Jarvis family. In all, the development around Paddington Basin will create {{convert|2000000|sqft|m2|abbr=on}} of offices, homes, shops and leisure facilities,&lt;ref name=Basin&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.paddingtonwaterside.co.uk/the-developments/paddington-basin/default.aspx | title=Paddington Basin / Merchant Square | publisher=Paddington Waterside Partnership | accessdate=29 October 2010 | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110719023011/http://www.paddingtonwaterside.co.uk/the-developments/paddington-basin/default.aspx | archivedate=19 July 2011 | df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; with the western end being developed first.

In April 2012 [[Westminster City Council]] sold the site to Amwaj Property Limited, of [[Bahrain]], which commissioned London-based [[Assael Architecture]] to design a residentially-oriented [[mixed-use]] development, the first phase of which was scheduled for completion in 2015 at an estimated cost of £71 million.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.assael.co.uk/content/north-wharf-gardens-paddington New neighbourhood in Paddington Basin] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131105073235/http://www.assael.co.uk/content/north-wharf-gardens-paddington |date=5 November 2013 }} Assael official website.

{{main|St Mary's Hospital, London}}
St Mary's is a major teaching hospital with a long tradition of biomedical research, from the first synthesis of [[heroin]] to the discovery of [[penicillin]]. It is housed in buildings dating back to 1845 between Praed Street and Paddington Basin. In October 2000, the London Regional Office of the NHS approved a plan for a Paddington Health Campus that would replace three run-down hospitals - St Marys, the [[Royal Brompton Hospital|Royal Brompton]] and [[Harefield Hospital|Harefield]].&lt;ref name=nao&gt;{{cite web | title=Department of Health - The Paddington Health Campus scheme | url=http://www.nao.org.uk/publications/0506/department_of_health_-_the_pad.aspx | publisher=National Audit Office | date= 19 May 2006 | accessdate=29 October 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The initial cost was estimated at £411m at 2005 prices with completion in 2006,&lt;ref name=nao /&gt; to be financed by [[private finance initiative|PFI]],&lt;ref name=bbc&gt;{{cite news | url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/london/4994254.stm | title='Super-hospital' failure slammed | publisher=BBC News | date=19 May 2006 | accessdate=29 October 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; but it became apparent that the scheme was too big for the original St Mary's site.&lt;ref name=nao /&gt; Various locations north of the canal basin were investigated but the scheme was finally abandoned in May 2005 after costs had spiralled to £894m and the completion date put back to 2013.&lt;ref name=nao /&gt; £15m was spent on the project, leading [[Richard Bacon (politician)|a member]] of the Commons [[Public Accounts Committee (United Kingdom)|Public Accounts Committee]] to describe it as "an object lesson in how not to build hospitals....a shambles of the first order",&lt;ref name=bbc /&gt; and [[Steve Webb|a colleague]] called it "incompetence on a massive scale".&lt;ref name=bbc /&gt;

The land north of the canal that had been earmarked for the Health Campus became the Merchant Square development in Paddington Basin (see above).&lt;ref name=merchant/&gt;  The planning application was formally withdrawn in May 2008&lt;ref name=factsheet /&gt; but St Mary's remains part of the Paddington Waterside Partnership.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.paddingtonwaterside.co.uk/the-developments/st-marys-hospital/default.aspx | title=St Mary's Hospital/Imperial College | publisher=Paddington Waterside Partnership | accessdate=29 October 2010 | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110719023223/http://www.paddingtonwaterside.co.uk/the-developments/st-marys-hospital/default.aspx | archivedate=19 July 2011 | df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; The only recent development work has been a £15m upgrade of the QEQM Wing.&lt;ref name=factsheet /&gt;

Locatelli began teaching at Santa Clara University as a professor of [[accounting]] in 1974, the same year in which he was ordained a Jesuit priest.&lt;ref name=latimes/&gt; Within a few years, he was voted outstanding teacher of the year. He rose from Dean of the School of Business, to Academic Vice-President.

Locatelli was named the 27th President of [[Santa Clara University]] in 1988 after 14 years at the university.&lt;ref name=santaclarapr1&gt;{{cite news |first=|last=|title=Paul Locatelli, S.J. 1938-2010|url=http://www.scu.edu/news/?b=208&amp;c=7447|work=[[Santa Clara University]] press release |publisher=|date=2010-07-12 |accessdate=2010-07-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; During Locatelli's tenure as president, academics, admissions standards and endowment funding increased substantially.

Under Locatelli's presidency, Santa Clara University fully renovated or constructed nineteen new campus buildings, as well as a sports center.&lt;ref name=sjmn/&gt; This is the equivalent of two-thirds of all campus facilities. A prolific fundraiser, Locatelli raised millions for the construction spree which included new academic buildings, a [[business school]] building, [[residence halls]], a swim center, a tennis center, and the School of Arts and Science.&lt;ref name=sjmn/&gt; He also raised funds for [[scholarships]] at Santa Clara.&lt;ref name=sjmn/&gt; Locatelli phased out Santa Clara's [[fraternity]] and [[sorority]] houses, which lessened the influence of the Greek system on student life.&lt;ref name=sjmn/&gt; Controversially, Locatelli eliminated the school's Division II [[American football|football]] program in 1993.&lt;ref name=sjmn/&gt;

Locatelli spearheaded the effort to reroute [[California State Route 82|The Alameda (California State Route 82)]], which had previously run through the center of Santa Clara University's campus.&lt;ref name=sjmn/&gt; Locatelli also had a new entrance road, lined with [[palm trees]], built which leads to the [[Mission Santa Clara de Asís]], a 1777 [[Spain|Spanish]] mission which is now the centerpiece of Santa Clara's campus.&lt;ref name=sjmn/&gt;

Locatelli and Santa Clara University became involved with the [[Salvadoran Civil War]] during the late 1980s and early 1990s.&lt;ref name=sjmn/&gt; He offered Santa Clara as a refuge to the lone surviving Jesuit of the 1989 massacre at the [[Universidad Centroamericana]], in which six Jesuits, their housekeeper and her daughter were killed by the [[Salvadoran Army]]. (The surviving Jesuit priest had been out of El Salvador at the time of the killings).&lt;ref name=sjmn/&gt; Father Locatelli also implemented a program where Santa Clara students volunteered and worked at a women's center and urban schools in [[El Salvador]].&lt;ref name=sjmn/&gt;

Under President Locatelli's guidance, Santa Clara's [[Financial endowment|endowment]] at Santa Clara grew from $77 million in 1988 to approximately $700 million in 2008.&lt;ref name=sjmn/&gt;

Through the [[Ignatian Center for Jesuit Education]], the University has expanded its ability to connect students to communities in [[Silicon Valley]] and throughout the world. Locatelli was known affectionately by the students at SCU through a variety of nicknames; such as; "Papa Lōc", "Big Poppa P", "P. Loc", and the "Big P".&lt;ref name=sjmn/&gt;

On March 1, 2008, Locatelli announced his intention to resign during the 2008–09 academic year, after 20 years as university president, due to his additional responsibilities as Secretary of Higher Education of the [[Society of Jesus]] in [[Rome]], a post he had held since January 2007, coordinating the [[Jesuits]] 150 universities worldwide, to promote cooperation among Jesuit higher education institutions.&lt;ref name=tsc&gt;{{cite news |first=Liz|last=O'Brien|title=University president resigns to take on expanded role in Rome |url=http://media.www.thesantaclara.com/media/storage/paper946/news/2008/04/03/News/University.President.Resigns.To.Take.On.Expanded.Role.In.Rome-3300634.shtml|work=[[The Santa Clara]] |publisher=|date=2008-04-03 |accessdate=2010-07-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was subsequently promoted to chancellor of the university in November 2008 by new [[Santa Clara University]] President Michael Engh, S.J.&lt;ref name=scu&gt;{{cite news |first=Charles|last=McChesney|title=Chancellor's Office press release |url=http://www.scu.edu/chancellor/|work=[[Santa Clara University]] |publisher=|date=|accessdate=2010-07-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Recognitions===
On January 16, 2002 he was awarded the [[Pro Ecclesia et Pontifice]] from [[Roman Catholic Diocese of San Jose in California|San Jose]] Bishop [[Patrick Joseph McGrath]].&lt;ref name=scupr&gt;{{cite news |first=|last=|title=SCU president honored with 'Pro Ecclesia et Pontifice' Award|url=http://www.scu.edu/news/releases/release.cfm?c=4575|work=[[Santa Clara University]] |publisher=|date=2002-01-16 |accessdate=2010-07-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Father Locatelli was awarded the Spirit of [[Silicon Valley]] Lifetime Achievement Award from the [[Silicon Valley]] Leadership Group.&lt;ref name=sjmn/&gt; He was also a recipient of the David Packard Award in 2009.&lt;ref name=sjmn/&gt;

===Death===
Locatelli was diagnosed with [[pancreatic cancer]] in May 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.scu.edu/news/?b=208&amp;c=7447 |title=University Press Release |publisher=Santa Clara University |accessdate=2010-07-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the time Father Locatelli took ill, he was preparing for the fiftieth anniversary celebration and reunion of his classmates in the class of 1960 at [[Santa Clara University]], and had already sent out invitations, including one to [[Leon Panetta]]. He was moved to the hospice at Regis Jesuit Infirmary in [[Los Gatos]] on July 8, 2010. He died from [[pancreatic cancer]] on July 12, 2010, at the age of 71.&lt;ref name=sjmn/&gt;
&lt;ref name=latimes/&gt;

Locatelli was survived by his brothers, Albert and Harry.&lt;ref name=sjmn/&gt; [[CIA]] Director, former Congressman and [[White House Chief of Staff]] [[Leon Panetta]], a 1960 Santa Clara classmate of Locatelli's, stated after Father Locatelli's death that, "What Paul told you was always the truth. He didn't play games. You knew that what he said was what he believed. I don't think there is any question that he (Father Locatelli) will go down as one of the greatest presidents in [[Santa Clara, California|Santa Clara]] history."&lt;ref name=sjmn/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6769">'''Reyn (Rhein) Altin Johannes Lumenta''' (February 26, 1933 in [[Surabaya]] – September 28, 2003 in [[Jakarta]]) (or R.A.J. Lumenta) was the [[President (corporate title)|President]] and [[CEO]] of [[Garuda Indonesia]], the Indonesian National Airline, in the period of 1984-1988, replacing [[Wiweko Soepono]]. Born in [[Surabaya]], [[East Java]], from a [[Manado]] ethnic family of [[Sulawesi]], Lumenta grew up in Indonesia before continuing his education in the [[Netherlands]]. He graduated in “Vliegtuigbouw” from [[Hogere Technische School]] “Technicum” in [[Rotterdam]] in 1956. Having strong relation with Wagey and Saroinsong family clans.

==Career==
[[File:Reyn Altin Johannes Lumenta signing official papers.jpg|thumb|Reyn Altin Johannes Lumenta signing official papers]]
Lumenta started his career in Garuda Indonesia as an [[Airframe]] and [[System Engineer]] (1957-1958). A year later he was promoted to be Head of Maintenance for Garuda’s [[aircraft]] and held various [[management|Director]] Positions afterwards until 1975 when he became [[Company Secretary]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.kompas.com/kompas-cetak/0309/30/metro/591360.htm Kompas newspaper (2003), September 30, “Lumenta Meninggalkan Citra Baru Garuda” (Lumenta Left Garuda It’s New Image)] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050128051909/http://www.kompas.com/kompas-cetak/0309/30/metro/591360.htm |date=2005-01-28 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Lumenta was CEO of [[Merpati Nusantara Airlines]], a subsidiary of Garuda Indonesia, in the period of 1979-1983. He managed to convince the government to finance a major modernisation of Merpati, saving the company from debts and possible bankruptcy.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.angkasa-online.com/12/05/utama/utama2.htm Yusuf, D.N. (2002), Kisah Merpati yang Tersisih, Angkasa, no. 5, February 2002] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070819235734/http://www.angkasa-online.com/12/05/utama/utama2.htm |date=2007-08-19 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Lumenta then returned to Garuda to become President and CEO in November 1984.

==President of Garuda Indonesia==

As President of the airline, Lumenta led a number of bold reforms in the organisation. On his arrival Garuda was in debts of around US$914 million. Under his leadership the company experienced increased popularity and profits.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pdat.co.id/ “Reyn Altin Johannes Lumenta”, Apa dan Siapa (What and Who), Pusat Data dan Analisa (Centre of Data and Analysis), Tempo Indonesia] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130115153622/http://www.pdat.co.id/ |date=2013-01-15 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1985 he created a controversy by hiring foreign brand consultants [[Landor Associates]] to create a new logo and colour scheme for Garuda Indonesia, a project that cost the company millions of US dollars. This move was later on applauded as vital for the reputation and [[corporate identity]] of Garuda Indonesia as the national airline.

Lumenta also increased flights frequency and destinations, reduced ticket prices and collaborated with Merpati, introducing flexible tickets valid for both Indonesian airlines.

Lumenta was also known for his solidarity and generosity to committed employees; he increased staff basic salaries by almost ten folds and improved staff reward and welfare systems.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pdat.co.id/ “Reyn Altin Johannes Lumenta”, Apa dan Siapa (What and Who), Pusat Data dan Analisa (Centre of Data and Analysis), Tempo Indonesia] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130115153622/http://www.pdat.co.id/ |date=2013-01-15 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Other achievements==
Lumenta received “Bunga Seroja” award (1976) (see [[Indonesian invasion of East Timor]]) from HANKAM, the Indonesian Ministry of Security and Defense&lt;ref&gt;http://www.globalsecurity.org/military/world/indonesia/hankam.htm&lt;/ref&gt; for his contribution in the mass transportation of aids and volunteers to [[East Timor]].

Lumenta was a [[BMW]] motorcycle enthusiast, having toured [[Europe]], [[South East Asia]] and [[Indonesia]] with his blue BMW [[touring motorcycle]]. Lumenta established Ikatan Motor Besar Indonesia (IMBI), an Association of Big Motorcycles in Indonesia in 1976.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cci.co.id/ceremony/imbi.php Card CONNECTION Indonesia&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071016083847/http://cci.co.id/ceremony/imbi.php |date=2007-10-16 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Together with 15 other individuals, in July 1968 Lumenta participated in the establishment of Organisation of Amateur Radio Indonesia (ORARI),&lt;ref&gt;http://www.orari.net&lt;/ref&gt; a local member of the [[International Amateur Radio Union]] (IARU). His code name was YB0BY.&lt;ref&gt;[http://buletin.orari.net “From the Editor: Rhein Altin Johannes Lumenta, YBOBY”, Yusuf, A., Farianto, D., Electronic Bulletin ORARI, October 2003, 5th Edition, issue III]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Lumenta, R.A.J. (1986), Building a New Image, Flight International, vol. 130, no. 4022, pp. 29-31, Reed Business Information ltd&lt;/ref&gt;

==Personal==
His other hobbies included black-and-white [[photography]], [[painting]] and writing, both in English and [[Indonesian language]]. Several of his books and journal articles&lt;ref&gt;Lumenta, R.A.J. (1986), Building a New Image, Flight International, vol. 130, no. 4022, pp. 29-31, Reed Business Information ltd&lt;/ref&gt; were published, including Aerodinamika ([[Aerodynamics]]) (1985), Mixtures (1982-1984); an 11-series mini book on Radio Amateur, Bermotor (Motorcycling) (1988); about his motorcycle journey across [[Sumatra]], [[Malaysia]] and [[Thailand]]. His final book [[Medan]] – [[Padang, Indonesia|Padang]] 1.450 (1992) was about his motorcycle trips around [[North Sumatra]] and [[West Sumatra]] in the same year.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.kompas.com/kompas-cetak/0309/30/metro/591360.htm Kompas newspaper (2003), September 30, “Lumenta Meninggalkan Citra Baru Garuda” (Lumenta Left Garuda It’s New Image)] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050128051909/http://www.kompas.com/kompas-cetak/0309/30/metro/591360.htm |date=2005-01-28 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Lumenta was a charismatic individual. As an executive, he was rarely suited, and was widely remembered wearing a navy blue jacket, almost always with a test pen in his pocket.

He died on 28 September 2003 and was buried on October 1 2003 in [[Joglo]] cemetery, [[West Jakarta]].  Lumenta married a few times and left his last wife and several children; Altin, Johan, Ronald, Alice, Joan, Rita, Lucy, and Lucky.

'''Rosario Messina''', ([[Aci Castello]], December 1942 – [[Meda (Italy)|Meda]], March 9, 2011), was an Italian entrepreneur, who in 1978 founded the Italian company [[Flou (Company)|Flou]], an avant-garde furniture manufacturer.

== Biography ==

'''Rosario Messina''' was born in 1942 in the [[Sicily|Sicilian]] city of [[Aci Castello]] in 1942. His father – a farmer – died when he was a young man, leaving him the responsibility of the family. He was the eldest of five children and in 1958, he began working for the [[La Rinascente]] department store in [[Catania]], first as an apprentice, then as a salesperson and finally as head of department.

Simultaneously, he attended evening courses in book-keeping and qualified in record time, managing to complete five academic years in one.

Following his experience with La Rinascente, he worked in the local branch of [[Zanussi]]-Rex, the most important Italian manufacturer of electrical appliances at that time.

In the early [[Seventies]], he was asked to work in the furniture-design sector: he joined the company C&amp;B (now B&amp;B Italia) as an account officer for [[Sicily]] and [[Calabria]]. He then moved to the north of the country as the company's sales manager. In 1976, he started working with Cinova, another leading sofa manufacturing company. He was appointed as the sales manager, responsible for general management.

His professional turning point appeared when the soft furnishings company, [[Bassetti]], assigned him a difficult task: he was asked to launch 'the [[duvet]]', a product to replace the traditional [[blanket]] for beds.

It was a difficult undertaking, and made more complex by the opposition from the furniture dealers – the elective distribution channel – who opposed commercializing a low cost product distributed through other channels. Messina had a [[Eureka (word)|Eureka]] moment and intuitively felt that 'bed with the duvet' as opposed to duvet alone would be an overwhelming success.

This ingenious idea led to the foundation of the company [[Flou (Company)|Flou]] in 1978 and the presentation of the bed  'Nathalie' designed by [[Vico Magistretti]], an article that unquestionably was the prototype of a new design direction: the modern textile bed.

Flou was a true pioneer in the 'culture of sleep' and rapidly became a leader in the world of furnishings, making an important contribution to enhancing the image of [[Italian design]] in the world.&lt;ref name="flou"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.flou.it/#/azienda/fondatore|title=Flou|publisher=flou.it|accessdate=March 12, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Official appointments ===

Between 1994 and 1998, Rosario Messina was President of the Gruppo Mobili Assarredo. From 1998, he was President of Assarredo, the trade association of Federlegno-Arredo that groups together the Italian furniture and furnishing industries. He was a member of the steering committee of the Council of Federlegno-Arredo, and was appointed to the same role with the industrial confederation [[Confindustria]] [[Monza e Brianza]].

In 1999 he was appointed to the most prestigious position as President of Cosmit, the organizing body for [[Milan Furniture Fair]].&lt;ref name="ilsole24ore"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.casa24.ilsole24ore.com/art/arredamento-casa/2011-03-10/addio-rosario-messina-padre-140909.php?uuid=AaoSz0ED|title=Addio a Rosario Messina, il padre del Salone del mobile|publisher=casa24.ilsole24ore.com|accessdate=March 12, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;
This is the world's most important furniture exhibition and under his Presidency, the [[Milan Furniture Fair]] (and the collateral exhibitions of Euroluce (Lighting), Eurocucina (Kitchens), Salone del Bagno [Bathrooms], Salone del Complemento d'Arredo (Furnishing Accessories), Salone dell'Ufficio (Office), Salone Satellite (Collateral events) progressed from being a simple trade show to a spectacular event, with the promotion of important cultural events that consolidated Milan as the unchallengeable 'Design capital'. The Salon was transformed into a meeting place for questions and answers as well as being a platform for 360° proposals in all areas of design culture and innovation.

The last edition under his management took place in 2011: a total of 321,320 people visited the event (up 7% on 2010 and 2% on 2009) and the 'Satellite Salon' that was actively promoted by Messina; this spin-off initiative started quietly and today is the most prestigious stage for showcasing up-and-coming designers and architects from the specialist educational aspects around the world.

In June 2008, during the annual general meeting, Rosario Messina was elected President of Federlegno-Arredo, the organization of [[Confindustria]] that represents 2,300 companies in 12 associations (Assarredo [Furnishings], Assobagno [Bathrooms], Assoimballaggi [Packaging], Assolegno [Wood and Timber], Assoluce [Lighting], Assopannelli [Panels], Assufficio [Office], Edilegno [Timber houses], Fedecomlegno [The Italian National Timber Association], Asal Assoallestimenti [Stands and Layouts], Aippl [Wooden flooring and laying], Apil [Lighting]); these represent the entire section of timber-furnishings: from the raw materials to the finished product.

He was a councillor on the steering committee of the foundation 'Center for the development of Italo-Russian trade relations".

On October 30, 2008, the then president of Confundustria, [[Emma Marcegaglia]], appointed him as a delegate of  the industrial confederation  Confindustria and according to the constitution, he automatically held the position of Vice President of CFI (The Italian industrial confederation).

'''Samuel Cabot Jr.''' (1784-1863) was an American businessman in the [[Old China Trade|early-nineteenth-century China Trade]], a member of the wealthy and prominent [[Cabot family]].

==Life==
Samuel Cabot Jr. was born in [[Boston, Massachusetts]] in 1784, the son of Samuel Cabot and Sally Barrett. In 1806, after a couple of years familiarizing himself with the East Indies trade, he set up business in [[Philadelphia]], in partnership with Samuel Hazard. In 1808 he returned to Boston and married Eliza Perkins, a daughter of [[Thomas Handasyd Perkins]]. Together, they had seven sons, including [[Edward Clarke Cabot]] (b. 1818), later an architect and artist; [[James Elliot Cabot]] (b. 1821), who became a philosopher and author; and [[Samuel Cabot III]], a surgeon and ornithologist.

After marrying Eliza, Samuel then went into business with his brother Joseph and with John W. Perit, taking charge of the Philadelphia-based partnership's Boston office.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Cabot, Samuel |work= Merchant Biographies|accessdate=6 March 2015 |url=http://www.cap.amdigital.co.uk/FurtherResources/MerchantBiographies/Cabot| publisher = [[Adam Matthew Digital]] |subscription=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He entered the China Trade in 1817, in yet another family partnership, with his Perkins in-laws. He retired from business in 1838, one of the richest merchants in New England.

:''Leedo redirects here. For the similar-sounding word, see [[Lido (disambiguation)]]''
'''Vjatšeslav Leedo''' (born 1952) is the [[stockholder]]{{clarify|date=May 2017|reason="The stockholder" is extremely vague. Is he the sole shareholder? Or at least the majority shareholder?
