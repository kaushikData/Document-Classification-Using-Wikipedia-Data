'''1871 in sports''' describes the year's events in world sport.

==[[American football]]==
'''College championship'''
* [[NCAA Division I FBS National Football Championship|College football national championship]] – none
'''Events'''
* The [[1871 college football season]] is the only one since the first season in [[1869 college football season|1869]] until the present day that no games are played in the entire season.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.collegefootballblog.org/2006/03/national_champions_18691879.html "National Champions: 1869–1879"]. Jimmy Atkinson. ''Retrospective National Championship Project''. College Football Blog. 20 March 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.the-game.org/history-waltercamp.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2013-04-05 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130405055140/http://www.the-game.org/history-waltercamp.htm |archivedate=2013-04-05 |df= }}. history-waltercamp.htm (''the-game.org''). &lt;!-- archive fileserver is down; URL seems to be http://web.archive.org/web/20130405055140/http://www.the-game.org/history-waltercamp.htm --&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;  Thus 1871 is the only year since play began in which no [[NCAA Division I FBS National Football Championship|college football national champion]] can be named, retrospectively or otherwise.

==[[Association football]]==
'''England'''
* Inaugural [[FA Cup]] competition begins with four matches played on 11 November.  The 15 clubs entering the competition are all amateur and mainly from the London area: [[Barnes R.F.C.|Barnes]], Civil Service, [[Clapham Rovers F.C.|Clapham Rovers]], [[Crystal Palace F.C. (1861)|Crystal Palace (1861)]], Donnington School, Hampstead Heathens, Harrow Chequers, Hitchin, Maidenhead, Marlow, Reigate, Priory, [[Royal Engineers A.F.C.|Royal Engineers]], [[Upton Park F.C.|Upton Park]], [[Wanderers F.C.|The Wanderers]] and [[Queen's Park FC|Queen's Park]] (Glasgow).
: The Wanderers win the Cup on 16 March 1872.

==[[Baseball]]==
'''National championship'''
* [[National Association of Professional Base Ball Players]] champion – [[Philadelphia Athletics (National League)|Philadelphia Athletics]]
'''Events'''
* March — ten [[NABBP]] clubs found the [[National Association of Professional Base Ball Players]], the first [[professional sports league organization|professional sports league]]. (Today it is commonly considered the first [[Major League Baseball|major league]] and usually called simply the "National Association" or "NA".) Thirty-three clubs establish a parallel amateur NAABBP that withers away.
* There are nine NA teams in the field and [[Philadelphia Athletics (National Association)|Athletic]] of Philadelphia wins the championship in the final game, 30 October.

==[[Boxing]]==
'''Events'''
* With the main American Championship title claimant [[Mike McCoole]] inactive this year, attention focuses on two fights between [[Jem Mace]] and [[Joe Coburn]].  Both fights are drawn and Mace continues to state his claim to the American Championship.  However, having suffered a hand injury in his second fight with Coburn, Mace relinquishes all his title claims and returns to exhibition boxing.&lt;ref name="JM"&gt;[http://www.cyberboxingzone.com/boxing/mace-j.htm Cyber Boxing Zone – Jem Mace].  Retrieved on 8 November 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;
* McCoole is now generally regarded as the champion by default, his main challenger being [[Tom Allen (boxer)|Tom Allen]] who was defeated by McCoole in 1869.&lt;ref name="MM"&gt;[http://www.cyberboxingzone.com/boxing/mccoole.htm Cyber Boxing Zone – Mike McCoole].  Retrieved on 8 November 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

==[[Cricket]]==
'''Events'''
* [[Derbyshire County Cricket Club|Derbyshire]] plays its inaugural [[first-class cricket|first-class]] match v. [[Lancashire County Cricket Club|Lancashire]] at [[Old Trafford Cricket Ground|Old Trafford]] on 26 &amp; 27 May.
'''England'''
* Most runs – [[W. G. Grace]] 2,739 @ 78.25 (HS 268), a staggering feat on the pitches of the time. [[Richard Daft]] has the next highest average among batsmen playing 10 innings or more, with 37.66, less than half of Grace's figure. [[Harry Jupp]] has the next highest runs aggregate, with 1,068. Grace makes ten centuries in the season, while no other player can manage more than one.
* Most wickets – [[James Southerton]] 151 @ 15.72 (BB 8–63)

==[[Gaelic football]]==
* During the 1860s and 1870s, rugby and association football have started to become popular in Ireland.  According to Gaelic football historian [[Jack Mahon (Gaelic footballer)|Jack Mahon]], [[caid (sport)|caid]] has begun to give way to a "rough-and-tumble game" which even allows tripping.
* [[County Limerick]] is the stronghold of the native game around this time and the Commercials Club, founded by employees of Cannock's Drapery Store, is one of the first to impose a set of rules that is later adopted by other clubs in the county.

==[[Golf]]==
'''Major tournaments'''
* [[The Open Championship|British Open]] – no competition.
* The Open has been administered since 1860 by [[Prestwick Golf Club]] but controversy prevents the tournament being held in 1871, the only exception outside the two World Wars. Finally it is agreed that Prestwick will henceforth organise the tournament jointly with [[The Royal &amp; Ancient Golf Club of St Andrews]] and [[The Honourable Company of Edinburgh Golfers]].

==[[Horse racing]]==
'''England'''
* [[1871 Grand National|Grand National]] – The Lamb (second win, having also won in 1868)
* [[1,000 Guineas Stakes]] – [[Hannah (horse)|Hannah]]
* [[2,000 Guineas Stakes]] – Bothwell
* [[Epsom Derby|The Derby]] – [[Favonius (horse)|Favonius]]
* [[Epsom Oaks|The Oaks]] – Hannah
* [[St. Leger Stakes]] – Hannah
'''Australia'''
* [[Melbourne Cup]] – The Pearl
'''Canada'''
* [[Queen's Plate]] – Floss
'''Ireland'''
* [[Irish Grand National]] – The Doe
* [[Irish Derby Stakes]] – Maid of Athens 
'''USA'''
* [[Belmont Stakes]] – [[Harry Bassett (horse)|Harry Bassett]]

==[[Rowing (sport)|Rowing]]==
'''The Boat Race'''
* 1 April — [[Cambridge University Boat Club|Cambridge]] wins the 28th [[The Boat Race 1871|Oxford and Cambridge Boat Race]]
'''Other'''
* There is no [[Harvard–Yale Regatta]]. From the third Race in 1859, the only exceptions outside major wars are 1871 and 1896.

==[[Rugby football]]==
'''Events'''
* 26 January — the [[Rugby Football Union]] (RFU) is founded at the Pall Mall Restaurant, which is situated near [[Trafalgar Square]] at 1 Cockspur Street, London.  The formation of the RFU establishes the "handling game" as a different sport to the "[[association football|dribbling game]]" that is increasingly being played under the auspices of [[the Football Association]].
* 21 clubs are represented at the meeting: Blackheath, Richmond, Ravenscourt Park, West Kent, Marlborough Nomads, Wimbledon Hornets, Gipsies, Civil Service, Law Club, Wellington College, Guy's Hospital, Flamingoes, Clapham Rovers, Harlequins, King's College, St Paul's School, Queen's House, Lausanne, Addison, Mohicans, [[Belsize Park Rugby Football Club|Belsize Park]].  Algernon Rutter of Richmond is elected the first president.  A committee is selected to produce a definitive national set of Rugby Football laws.
* 27 March — the [[1871 England versus Scotland rugby union match|first ever official international fixture]] in any kind of football takes place with a rugby football game between Scotland and England.  Scotland (i.e., Scottish members of the RFU) defeats England (i.e., English members of the RFU) by 1 goal &amp; 1 try to 1 try at Raeburn Place in Edinburgh.  The match is played by teams of 20–a–side and the game lasts for 50 minutes each way.
* Foundation of [[Worcester RFC]]

==[[Yacht racing]]==
'''America's Cup'''
* The [[New York Yacht Club]] retains the [[America's Cup]] as ''[[Columbia (1871 yacht)|Columbia]]'' and its substitute ''[[Sappho (yacht)|Sappho]]'' defeat British challenger ''Livonia'' of the Royal Harwich Yacht Club.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="24462">The '''Challenge 1934''' was the fourth and last [[Fédération Aéronautique Internationale|FAI]] International Tourist Plane Contest ({{lang-fr|Challenge International de Tourisme}}), that took place between August 28 and September 16, 1934, in [[Warsaw]], [[Poland]]. The four Challenges, from 1929 to 1934, were major aviation events in pre-war Europe. The 1934 Challenge was won by the Polish pilots, who had also won [[Challenge 1932|the previous year]].

[[Image:Challenge1934.jpg|thumb|350px|The opening ceremony, from the left: Polish team, three-aircraft Czechoslovak team, German team. The Italian team had not arrived yet.]]

==Overview==
Poland and the [[Polish Aero Club]] organized the contest because a Polish pilot [[Franciszek Żwirko]] had won the [[Challenge 1932|previous Challenge]] in [[1932 in aviation|1932]].  The contest rules were announced in June 1933: like the previous contest, it consisted of three parts: technical trials, a [[rallying|rally]] over [[Europe]] and a maximum speed trial, but there were changes in details. Since one of the aims of the Challenges was to stimulate the development of tourist aircraft, a stress  was placed upon aircraft performance and quality, although pilots' skills remained crucial.

The opening ceremony was held at noon on August 28, 1934, at [[Pole Mokotowskie|Mokotowskie field]] in Warsaw (the Italian team was late by two hours due to weather and arrived during the ceremony). During an air show, a Polish fighter [[PZL P.7]]a performing aerobatics crashed, but the pilot survived with injuries.

The number of crews and aircraft that eventually took part in the 1934 Challenge was smaller - 34 compared to 43 in the 1932 Challenge, because the contest was more difficult. The aircraft flew with  a two-man crew (pilot and mechanic). Only four countries entered teams for the Challenge in 1934: [[Poland]] (12 crews), [[Germany]] (13 crews), [[Italy]] (6 crews) and [[Czechoslovakia]] (3 crews). The British aviator Walter MacPherson entered the contest in the Polish team. The French team of eight crews resigned from the contest, because a development of a new aircraft, the [[Caudron Simoun|Caudron C.500]] had not finished in time and its weight was too great. The first prize in the Challenge was 100,000 [[French franc]]s, the second  40,000 FF, the third 20,000 FF and the fourth 10,000 FF; 15 other crews would get 6,000 FF.

==Aircraft==
The Challenge was to be a contest of tourist aircraft, so competing aircraft had to be able to take at least two persons aboard, take off and land on a short field and cover a distance with a good cruise speed. For this Challenge, all countries designed new aircraft especially to meet the contest demands, the only exception was a single  [[de Havilland Puss Moth]] flown by MacPherson, although this had been was modified for the competition. All these aircraft were [[monoplane]]s with 3 or 4 seats in an enclosed cabin, advanced wing design with ([[flap (aircraft)|flaps]] and [[Leading edge slats|slats]] and some other devices) and mixed or metal construction.

[[Image:Pzl26.jpg|thumb|250px|The Polish PZL.26 of Ignacy Giedgowd in the Challenge markings]]
Most aircraft were fast [[cantilever]] low-wing monoplanes: the German [[Messerschmitt Bf 108]] (4), [[Fieseler Fi 97]] (5) and [[Klemm Kl 36]] (4), the Polish [[PZL.26]] (5) and the Italian [[Pallavicino PS-1]] (2) or braced low-wing monoplanes: the Czechoslovak [[Aero A.200]] (2) and the Italian [[Breda Ba.39]] (2) and [[Breda Ba.42|Ba.42]] (2). An exception were the basic aircraft of the Polish team - high-wing braced monoplanes [[RWD-9]] (7), one of which was also flown by the Czechoslovak crew, and the Puss Moth. Of those, the Bf 108 and PS-1 had a retractable [[landing gear]].

The German aircraft had starting numbers from a range 12-26, the Italian 41-46, the Czechoslovak 51-54 and the Polish 61-81: the numbers were placed on the fuselage in a black square frame.

==Technical trials==
On August 29 the technical evaluation of the competing aircraft's construction started. Since it was a tourist aircraft contest, features such as a comfortable cabin with a good view, the presence of the third and fourth seats, seats placed side-by-side, a comprehensive set of controls, ease and time of engine starting, ease of wings' folding, safety devices and modern construction with the use of metal were awarded points. The view was evaluated by placing a lamp in the cabin while the aircraft was in a dark hangar and examining light area. All the German aircraft, two Italian and the Puss Moth exceeded theempty weight limit of {{convert|560.56| kg|lb|abbr=on}} and had to have some unnecessary parts removed. The first technical trial to be completed was a quick engine starting, carried on 31 August-1 September. Most aircraft scored  the maximum 24 points in it.

Technical evaluation lasted until September 4, and the most points were given to the [[Messerschmitt Bf 108|Bf 108]]s (450-452 pts),followed by the [[Pallavicino PS-1]] (438 pts), the [[Fieseler Fi 97|Fi 97]]s (428-431 pts), the [[Aero A.200]] (429 pts) and the [[RWD-9]] (427 pts). The other scores were: [[Klemm Kl 36]] - 394-407 pts, [[PZL.26]] - 383 pts, [[de Havilland Puss Moth|Puss Moth]] - 373 pts and Bredas - 323-346 pts.

On September 3–4 there was a short take off trial, which required the crews to fly over an {{convert|8|m|ft|abbr=on}} high barrier. The best performer was the Czechoslovak Vojtěch Žáček, taking off from the closest distance of {{convert|74.5| m|ft|abbr=on}} (Aero A.200), then Jerzy Bajan (RWD-9) and [[Ján Ambruš]] with the second A.200. The Polish RWD-9s and PZL.26s and the German Fi 97s  also performed well, while the Italians and most other German aircraft appeared inferior, with results above {{convert|100| m|ft|sigfig=3|abbr=on}}. For comparison, the best result from the previous Challenge was {{convert|91.6| m|ft||abbr=on}}.

After the technical evaluation and the short take-off trial, on September 4 the leaders were the Germans flying Bf 108s: [[Theo Osterkamp]] (597 points), [[Werner Junck]] (596 points) and Otto Brindlinger (594 points), then Vojtěch Žáček (A.200, 594 points), Jerzy Bajan (RWD-9, 591 points) and [[Ján Ambruš]] (A.200, 591 points), then German Fi 97s and Polish RWD-9s.

Next, on September 4–5, followed a short landing trial, behind an 8-m high barrier. The best result, {{convert|75 |m|ft|abbr=on}} (210 points) was achieved by [[Hans Seidemann]] (Fi 97). In the first ten scores there were other Fieselers, the Polish RWD-9s and PZL.26s and MacPherson's Puss Moth. The Czechoslovak A.200s had the worst results, above {{convert|117| m|ft|abbr=on}}, along with Bredas and Bf 108s. The best result from the previous Challenge was {{convert|92.4| m|ft}}.

A fuel consumption trial on a {{convert|594|km|mi|abbr=on}} closed circuit was held on September 5. The best were three [[Messerschmitt Bf 108|Bf 108]]s, scoring 86-95 pts, then five Poles with 73-79 points. Quite good results were scored by the Italians, while the German Fi 97s and Kl 36s and the Czechoslovaks were worst in this trial.

After further trials had been completed, on September 5 the leaders of a general classification changed and remained similar until the end of this part. Leaders were: Jerzy Bajan (RWD-9S, 875 pts), Tadeusz Karpiński (RWD-9S, 856 pts), [[Hans Seidemann]] (Fi 97, 850 pts), Gerhard Hubrich (Fi 97, 848 pts), Stanisław Płonczyński (RWD-9, 844 pts), then Karl Francke (Bf 108), Jan Buczyński (RWD-9), [[Wolf Hirth]] (Fi 97), Szczepan Grzeszczyk (PZL.26).

A minimal speed trial started on August 31, but it had to be continued on September 2 due to weather and some crews completed it only on September 6. The Pole [[Jerzy Bajan]] flying the [[RWD-9]] was the slowest with a speed of {{convert|54.14|kph|mph|abbr=on}}. Good results below 60&amp;nbsp;km/h were obtained by the other RWD-9s, the Czechoslovaks and the German Kl 36s and Fi 97s; the worst were Italian Bredas - above 75&amp;nbsp;km/h, what was not scored (a new device - slots in wings fitted in Bredas, proved useless in practice).

On September 1 there was a trial of quick folding of wings, which was a feature to save space in hangars. Also the aircraft dimensions and the way of folding were awarded points. The trial was completed only on September 6, and first 7 results were of RWD-9s with 36 points, followed by four Italians.

One German and one Italian crews damaged their aircraft during technical trials (Bf 108 and PS-1) and had to retire. It was however the best ratio of crews to complete the technical trials of all Challenges. Generally, top places were taken by RWD-9s and Fi 97s, while Bf 108s, Kl 36s and PZL.26s proved average, and Italian machines closed a list with 559-801 points.

==Rally over Europe==
The second part of the Challenge was a 9537.4&amp;nbsp;km rally over Europe and northern Africa, on a path: [[Warsaw]] - [[Königsberg]] - [[Berlin]] - [[Köln]] - [[Brussels]] - [[Paris]] - [[Bordeaux]] - [[Pau, Pyrénées-Atlantiques|Pau]] - [[Madrid]] - [[Seville]] - [[Casablanca]] - [[Meknes]] - [[Sidi Bel Abbes]] - [[Algiers]] (stage waypoint) - [[Biskra]] - [[Tunis]] - [[Palermo]] - [[Naples]] - [[Rome]] - [[Rimini]] - [[Zagreb]] - [[Vienna]] - [[Brno]] - [[Prague]] - [[Katowice]] - [[Lwów]] - [[Wilno]] - Warsaw. There were also 8 checkpoints, among others, in [[Tanger]], [[Messina]] and [[Castelfranco Veneto]]. The route was far longer and more difficult, than in previous contests. Awarded were, first of all, a cruise speed on a whole track, then a regularity of flight. Three nights apart from appointed airfields or a cruise speed below 130&amp;nbsp;km/h caused disqualification.

The rally started on September 7, in rain, between 5 and 5.30 am. The Bf 108s could take advantage of their speed and were first to reach [[Berlin]]. That day 24 fastest crews reached [[Paris]], flying 1752.4&amp;nbsp;km (10 Poles, 8 Germans, 3 Czechoslovaks and 3 Italians). The German Wolfgang Stein (Kl 36) and the Italian team's captain [[Ambrogio Colombo]] (Ba-42) had to land and quit due to engine faults. Several crews had similar problems, but managed to repair them.

On the next day, many crews, who started early, especially flying Bf 108s, had problems with locating an airfield in [[Bordeaux]] due to heavy fog and had forced landings, lowering their cruise speed (on that occasion, [[Theo Osterkamp]] and Gerhard Hubrich had problems with the local police). One Klemm Kl 36 was damaged during a forced landing and had to withdraw (Ernst Krüger). Most - 14 crews reached [[Seville]] that day, 9 stayed in [[Madrid]], while last two crews remained in [[Bordeaux]], including Stanisław Płonczyński (RWD-9). Two Poles (Andrzej Włodarkiewicz and Szczepan Grzeszczyk on PZL.26s) reached as far, as [[Casablanca]] (3715.2&amp;nbsp;km).

On September 9 all crews, that remained in the rally, reached Africa, with Andrzej Włodarkiewicz and three Bf 108s being in the lead. 18 crews reached [[Algiers]] that day (9 Poles, 6 Germans and 3 Czechs), flying 4774&amp;nbsp;km in total. Last two crews reached [[Meknes]], including Stanisław Płonczyński. Several crews withdrew that day: [[Fritz Morzik]] (the winner of 1929 and 1930 Challenges, flying Kl 36) had three forced landings before Algiers due to a fuel pump fault, also Szczepan Grzeszczyk's PZL.26's engine failed and he had a forced landing before [[Sidi Bel Abbes]]. Other German Kraft Eberhard (Kl 36) withdrew in Spain due to wing damage, the Pole Tadeusz Karpiński (RWD-9) quit in Seville because of low cruise speed, and one Italian quit because of illness (Pierro de Angeli). On September 10 the rest reached Algiers, and thus 24 crews completed the first part of the rally. The Pole Stefan Florjanowicz (RWD-9) had to withdraw there due to engine fault.

The contestants left Algiers on September 11, after a rest, and 23 crews reached [[Tunis]] that day. On September 12, the crews left for [[Palermo]], over the [[Mediterranean Sea]]. The flight was secured by the Italian Navy and the French floatplanes. 22 crews reached [[Rome]] that day, one Italian pilot withdrew due to engine damage.

On September 13 the weather was bad, but all but two crews reached [[Prague]] (7924&amp;nbsp;km). The fastest that day was [[Theo Osterkamp]] (Bf 108), but other two Bf 108 pilots had forced landings near [[Trieste]] due to weather and spent night at [[Zagreb]], what lowered their cruise speed.

On September 14, sixteen crews finished in Warsaw, greeted by crowds, the first was the Pole Ignacy Giedgowd (PZL-26). Among them were five Poles, six Germans, three Czechoslovaks and two Italians. That day, the fastest Polish pilot Andrzej Włodarkiewicz (PZL-26) had to land near [[Tarnów]] before [[Lwów]] and withdrew due to engine fault, also Walter MacPherson (Puss Moth) dropped out for the same reason before Lwów.

On September 15 last three crews reached Warsaw ([[Werner Junck]] and Karl Francke flying Bf 108s and Piotr Dudziński flying PZL.26). The last to drop out was Jan Balcer (PZL.26) due to a compressor damage, before [[Wilno]]. Fritz Morzik (Kl 36), Tadeusz Karpiński (RWD-9) and Andrzej Włodarkiewicz (PZL.26) finished that day in Warsaw, after repairing their aircraft, flying off the contest.

Only 19 crews out of 32 completed the rally. The only team to finish complete was the Czechoslovak one; apart from their A.200s, only all Fieseler Fi 97s completed the contest. In spite of highest maximum cruise speeds, the results of fastest Bf 108s was hampered by low cruise speeds in other stages of the rally. Best results were obtained by pilots who managed to maintain a good cruise speed during the whole rally. All participants who completed the rally, scored maximal amount of 160 points for regularity, spending nights on appointed airfields only.

After the technical trials and the race, Jerzy Bajan held first place in the general classification with 1855 points, with Stanisław Płonczyński in second with 1821 pts, Hans Seidemann in third with 1813 pts, followed by two Czechoslovaks, Slovak [[Ján Ambruš]] (1795 pts) and Czech Jan Anderle (1770 pts). Bf 108 pilots were 12th ([[Werner Junck]] - 1733 pts), 13th ([[Theo Osterkamp]] - 1729 pts) and 15th (Karl Francke - 1715 pts).

==Maximum speed trial==
The last part of the Challenge was a maximum speed trial, on a 297&amp;nbsp;km triangular course. The trial was carried out on Sunday, September 16, from 4 pm, at the Mokotowskie airfield in Warsaw.

Due to a [[handicapping]] system, contestants took off in order of general classification, with proper intervals, and an amount of points given in the speed trial meant, that the first on the finishing line would be the winner of the contest. Each km/h above 210&amp;nbsp;km/h was awarded with one point.

The fastest were three German Bf 108s, with Theo Osterkamp at the lead (291&amp;nbsp;km/h). Next three places were taken by the Polish RWD-9s: Stanisław Płonczyński, Jan Buczyński, Jerzy Bajan and Henryk Skrzypiński, the later ex eaquo with Hans Seidemann (Fi 97). The Pole Ignacy Giedgowd (PZL.26) and the Italian Ernesto Sanzin (Ba-39S) had to land due to engine faults and scored 0 points.

A closing ceremony was held soon after the maximum speed test on September 16. The winners were the Polish crew of pilot [[Jerzy Bajan]] and mechanic Gustaw Pokrzywka. Their success was not only a result of their aviation skills, but also of the technical features of their Polish-designed [[RWD-9]]. Due to their victory, Poland had a right to organize the next Challenge in 1936, but it decided not to, because of financial reasons. The FAI proposed that other countries organize the contest, but Germany, Italy and France declined. The 1934 Challenge remained the last Challenge and the [[Polish Aero Club]] was given a right to retain a transitory cup.

'''DNB Arena''' is an indoor [[ice hockey rink]] in [[Stavanger]], [[Norway]], and home to the [[GET-ligaen]] side [[Stavanger Oilers]]. Opened ahead of the [[2012–13 GET-ligaen season|2012–13 season]], the [[arena]] has a capacity for 4,500 spectators during [[ice hockey]] matches and 6,000 during concerts, including 36 [[executive boxes]]. The rink is unusual for Norway in that it has the [[National Hockey League]] rink size. The {{convert|16500|m2|sp=us}} building is designed by Arkitektkontoret Jobb and is named for [[DNB ASA|DNB]], a Norwegian banking group.

Plans for a new venue to replace the aging [[Stavanger Ishall]] were first articulated by club-owner Tore Christiansen in 2006. Construction started in May 2011, with Kruse Smith as the main contractor. Construction cost 210 million [[Norwegian krone]] (NOK). The venue is owned by the Oilers' investment company, which receives a combined 9&amp;nbsp;million per year from DNB and the municipality. The arena hosted group stages of [[2012–13 IIHF Continental Cup]] and [[2013 IIHF Women's World Championship Division I]].

==Construction==
Plans for a new arena for the Stavanger Oilers was first articulated by club-owner and chairman Tore Christiansen in 2006.&lt;ref name=idea&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.rogalandsavis.no/sport/oilers/article2418546.ece |title=– Oilershall i 2009 |work=[[Rogalands Avis]] |last=Svendsen |first=Torbjørn |date=17 November 2006 |language=Norwegian |accessdate=7 October 2012 |archivedate=7 October 2012 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6BF6YwAmY?url=http://www.rogalandsavis.no/sport/oilers/article2418546.ece |deadurl=no |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; By 2007 the Oilers had the highest attendance of any team in the GET-Ligaen, when they reached an average 2,000. The club stated that additional increase would be difficult, especially because seats were all sold to season ticket holders and that terrace spaces were only being sold to top matches.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.rogalandsavis.no/sport/oilers/article2540969.ece |title=Oilers har flest tilskuere |work=[[Rogalands Avis]] |last=Iversen |first=Espen |date=24 January 2007 |language=Norwegian |accessdate=7 October 2012 |archivedate=7 October 2012 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6BF6suZ8G?url=http://www.rogalandsavis.no/sport/oilers/article2540969.ece |deadurl=no |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Estadio Nacional Julio Martínez Prádanos''' (originally known as '''Estadio Nacional de Chile''') is the [[national stadium]] of [[Chile]], and is located in the [[Ñuñoa]] district of [[Santiago, Chile|Santiago]]. It is the largest stadium in Chile with an official capacity of 48,665. It is part of a 62 [[hectare]] sporting complex which also features [[tennis court]]s, an aquatics center, a modern [[gym]]nasium, a velodrome, a BMX circuit, and an assistant ground/warmup athletics track.

Construction began in February 1937 and the stadium was inaugurated on December 3, 1938. The [[architecture]] was based on the [[Olympic Stadium (Berlin)|Olympiastadion]] in [[Berlin]], [[Germany]]. The stadium was one of the venues for the [[1962 FIFA World Cup|FIFA World Cup in 1962]], and hosted [[1962 FIFA World Cup Final|the final]] where [[Brazil national football team|Brazil]] defeated [[Czechoslovakia national football team|Czechoslovakia]] 3-1. In 1948, the stadium hosted the matches of the [[South American Championship of Champions]], the competition that inspired the creation of the [[UEFA Champions League]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://globotv.globo.com/globocom/liga-dos-campeoes-da-uefa/v/especial-liga-dos-campeoes-completa-60-anos-e-neymar-ajuda-a-contar-essa-historia/4168641/ ''Globo Esporte'' TV Programme, Brazil, May 10, 2015: ''Especial: Liga dos Campeões completa 60 anos, e Neymar ajuda a contar essa história''. Accessed on December 6th 2015. In this interview to the Brazilian sports TV programme Globo Esporte, Jacques Ferran (the creator of the European Champions Cup) states that the South American Championship of Champions was his inspiration for the creation of the European continental competition. Ferran's speech goes from 5:02 to 6:51 in the video.] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304052701/http://globotv.globo.com/globocom/liga-dos-campeoes-da-uefa/v/especial-liga-dos-campeoes-completa-60-anos-e-neymar-ajuda-a-contar-essa-historia/4168641/ |date=2016-03-04 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and of the [[Copa Libertadores]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.conmebol.com/es/historia-copa-libertadores|title=Copa Libertadores. Historia |publisher= CONMEBOL|website=www.conmebol.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; The stadium was notoriously used as a [[internment|prison camp]] and torture facility by the military regime following the [[Chilean coup d'état]].

In 2009, a complete modernization plan was unveiled for the stadium and surrounding facilities. President [[Michelle Bachelet]] said it would become the most modern stadium in South America.&lt;ref name="latercera"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://papeldigital.info/lt/|title=Estadio Nacional costará US$ 42 millones y la "Roja" se va al Monumental|work=[[La Tercera]]|date=2009-06-16|accessdate=2009-06-16|language=Spanish|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090611190808/http://papeldigital.info/lt/|archivedate=2009-06-11|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The stadium will be the Opening and Closing ceremonies, athletics and football venue for the [[2023 Pan American Games]].
[[File:180° Panorama Estadio Nacional Santiago Chile.jpg|right|300px]]

==History==
The stadium was built on former farmland, donated in 1918 by farmer Jose Domingo Cañas.  The first sporting event in the new stadium took place on 3 December 1938, with a friendly game between the Chilean club [[Colo-Colo]] and Brazilian club [[São Cristóvão]].  Colo-Colo won 6–3.

It has hosted all matches of the [[1941 South American Championship|1941]], [[1945 South American Championship|1945]] and [[1955 South American Championship|1955]] South American Football Championships, and several matches of the [[1991 Copa América|1991]] and [[2015 Copa América|2015]] [[Copa América]].

The stadium hosted the final stages of the [[1959 FIBA World Championship|1959 World Basketball Championship]].  It was held outdoors because the intended venue, the [[Movistar Arena|Metropolitan Indoor Stadium]], was not ready in time.

In the early 1960s, under the government of [[Jorge Alessandri]], the stadium was expanded to host the [[1962 FIFA World Cup]]. The main change was that the velodrome that surrounded the stadium was replaced by galleries, thereby increasing its original capacity to around 95,000.

The stadium hosted group stage games between [[Italy]], [[West Germany]], [[Switzerland]] and Chile, including a notoriously ill-tempered and violent clash between Italy and Chile which became known as the [[Battle of Santiago (1962 FIFA World Cup)|Battle of Santiago]].  Also held at the ground were a quarter-final, a semi-final, the third place play-off, and the final, in which Brazil was crowned world champions for the second time.  In the third-place play-off, Chile defeated Yugoslavia 1–0, marking the team's greatest success in international football.

Today, the ground serves as the home field for both the national team and the first-division club [[Universidad de Chile (football club)|Universidad de Chile]]. It also hosts non-sporting events, such as political celebrations, charity events and concerts.

The stadium has been used since 1995 as the final leg of the [[Teletón (Chile)|Telethon]], a 28-hour telecast. The stadium holds up to 100,000 people for this annual event with the Jumbotron showing the required amount to reach the goal and its current total.

On July 5, 2008, the stadium was officially renamed ''Estadio Nacional [[Julio Martínez Prádanos]]'', in honor of a recently deceased sports journalist.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bcn.cl/actualidad_legislativa/estadio-julio-martinez-pradanos |title=Publicada Ley que denomina Julio Martínez al Estadio Nacional de Santiago – Biblioteca del Congreso Nacional de Chile |language=es |publisher=Bcn.cl |date= |accessdate=2011-06-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Use as a detention center===
[[File:Chile- el pueblo vencera cropped.jpg|thumb|300px|Estadio Nacional de Chile after the [[1973 Chilean coup d'état]].]]

After the [[1973 Chilean coup d'état|coup d'état]] of September 11, 1973 that ousted President Salvador Allende, the stadium began to be used as a detention facility. An article in the ''Harvard Review of Latin America'' reported that "there were over eighty detention centers in Santiago alone" and gave details of the National Stadium and others.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.drclas.harvard.edu/revista/articles/view/704 |title=Harvard Review of Latin America: Chile's National Stadium, with details on several detention centers |publisher=Drclas.harvard.edu |date= |accessdate=2011-06-03 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110811054833/http://www.drclas.harvard.edu/revista/articles/view/704 |archivedate=August 11, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Over 40,000 people spent time in the compound during the ''junta'' regime. Twelve thousand detainees were interned between September 11 and November 7.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.consejodelacultura.cl/chileaudiovisual1/pag/pc-documentales.html |title= Chile Audio Visual |publisher=Consejodelacultura.cl |date= |accessdate=2011-06-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; The field and gallery were used to hold men, while women were held in the [[swimming pool]] changing rooms and associated buildings. Locker rooms and corridors were all used as prison facilities while interrogations were carried out in the [[velodrome]].&lt;ref&gt;Carmen Luz Parot, 2002, ''Estadio Nacional. Documental'' (''National Stadium Documentary''). Produced by ''Sello Alerce'', Chile, 2002.&lt;/ref&gt; The Red Cross estimated that 7,000 prisoners occupied the stadium at one point, of whom about 300 were foreigners. According to the testimonies of survivors collected by the humanitarian group, detainees were tortured and threatened with death by shooting. Some were shot on the premises and then taken to unknown locations for execution.

[[FIFA]] President [[Stanley Rous|Sir Stanley Rous]] insisted the [[USSR national football team|USSR team]] to play [[1974 FIFA World Cup qualification (UEFA–CONMEBOL play-off)|a World Cup qualifier]] at the time. They however refused to do so and [[Chile national football team|Chile]] qualified automatically for the [[1974 FIFA World Cup|1974 World Cup]], where they failed to advance from a group containing both [[German national football team|West]] and [[East Germany national football team|East Germany]] and [[Australia national football team|Australia]].

The use of the stadium during the coup d'état is depicted in the 2002 [[documentary film]] ''Estadio Nacional'', directed and produced by [[Carmen Luz Parot]], and in the 2007 Swedish film ''[[The Black Pimpernel]]'', which is based on the story of Swedish ambassador in Chile [[Harald Edelstam]] and his heroic actions to protect the lives of over 1,200 people during and after the military coup. ''The Black Pimpernel'' was shot on location in Santiago. The 1982 film ''[[Missing (1982 film)|Missing]]'' by Greek filmmaker [[Costa-Gavras]] depicts the September 11, 1973 coup d'état and execution of American journalists [[Charles Horman]] and [[Frank Teruggi]] at the Estadio Nacional.

In 2011, Chile set aside a section of the stadium, a section of old wooden bleachers called [[:es:Escotilla n.º 8|"Escotilla 8"]], to honor the prisoners who were detained there.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://medium.com/off-the-field/the-soccer-match-that-should-have-never-been-played-8679e8d91191 |title= The Soccer Match That Should Have Never Been Played  |publisher=medium.com |date= |accessdate=2017-11-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===2009–2010 renovation===
[[File:Adios Matador.jpg|thumb|[[Marcelo Salas]] farewell match, June 2, 2009]]
On June 15, 2009, President [[Michelle Bachelet]] announced several infrastructure improvements in order to modernize the stadium and its immediate facilities. Out of the total 24 billion [[Chilean peso|pesos]] (US$42.3 million) contemplated in the plan, 20 billion pesos (US$35.3 million) are destined to bring the stadium up to modern standards. The changes include, a roof covering all the seats, which will also provide illumination; installation of seats around the entire stadium, lowering the current capacity to 47,000; a new state-of-the-art [[scoreboard]]; a 2.5 m deep 2 m wide pit will separate the track and the spectators to replace the fence; and several other changes. Because the stadium is a [[National Monuments of Chile|national monument]] the façade will remain the same, with the roof structure placed on top, without modifying the exterior. The stadium was closed on August 15, 2009. The stadium was scheduled to be reinaugurated in March 2010 to stage a double friendly match between Chile and [[North Korea]] and [[Panama]], but the works were not finished on time. The construction of the roof has since been postponed by the government of President [[Sebastián Piñera]] due to financial constraints brought about by the [[2010 Chile earthquake|February 27, 2010 earthquake]]. Although the stadium suffered minor damage from the earthquake, it partially opened to host the match between [[Universidad de Chile (football club)|C.F. Universidad de Chile]] and [[C.D. Guadalajara]] for [[2010 Copa Libertadores|Copa Libertadores 2010]]. It was officially re-inaugurated on September 12, 2010, during Chile's bicentennial festivities.

===2014 South American Games renovation===
On September 12, 2010, during the Chilean bicentennial festivities, President [[Sebastián Piñera]] announced that the capacity of the stadium will be increased so as to reach 70,000 seats for the [[2014 South American Games]] that will take place in Santiago.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://diario.latercera.com/2010/09/13/01/contenido/deportes/4-38522-9-el-nacional-sera-para-70-mil-personas.shtml |title=La Tercera Edición Impresa |publisher=Diario.latercera.com |date= |accessdate=2011-06-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; The works are expected to begin in 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://diario.latercera.com/2010/09/19/01/contenido/deportes/4-39062-9-el-actual-nacional-no-es-negocio-para-la-seleccion.shtml |title=La Tercera Edición Impresa |publisher=Diario.latercera.com |date= |accessdate=2011-06-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On June 3, 2011 further renovation plans were announced by the government. The complete area surrounding the stadium will be turned into a park to be called "Citizenry Park" (''Parque de la Ciudadanía''). Over 70% of the new 64-hectare park will consist of green areas, and the rest will include new infrastructure such as a lagoon or restaurants. The new park is expected to be ready for the 2014 games. New sporting venues will be built for the 2014 games, such as two modern gymnasiums, a new heated pool for [[synchronized swimming]], a renovated velodrome and an expanded CAR, which will also serve as residence of the future Ministry of Sports. The only venues that will remain are the stadium, the main tennis court, the velodrome, the CAR, the athletics track, the skating track, the hockey field and the ''caracolas''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://diario.latercera.com/2011/06/03/01/contenido/santiago/32-71340-9-parque-del-estadio-nacional-tendra-una-laguna-restaurantes-y-cafes.shtml |title=Parque del Estadio Nacional tendrá una laguna, restaurantes y cafés &amp;#124; Santiago &amp;#124; La Tercera Edición Impresa |publisher=Diario.latercera.com |date=1990-01-01 |accessdate=2011-06-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Attendances==

The highest attendance for a match at Estadio Nacional to date is 85,268, for a [[Liga Chilena de Fútbol: Primera División|Primera Division]] match played on December 29, 1962; [[Universidad de Chile (football club)|Universidad de Chile]] defeated [[Club Deportivo Universidad Católica|Universidad Catolica]] 4–1.{{Citation needed|date=June 2009}} In the 2016–17 season, [[Universidad de Chile]] drew an average home league attendance of 30,041 for the Apertura and 33,466 for the Clausura.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.worldfootball.net/attendance/chi-primera-division-2016-2017-clausura/1/|title=Primera División 2016/2017 Clausura – Attendance|website=worldfootball.net}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Concerts==
The stadium hosts many international, and two national ([[Los Prisioneros]]), concerts during the year. [[Rod Stewart]] was the first international artist to perform at the stadium. The concert brought more than 200,000 fans to the venue and was broadcast throughout the country. After that, the city started being included in many tours from international artists.

The Following is a list of concerts, showing date, artist or band, tour, opening acts and attendance.

== Capacity ==
The stadium was built with an original capacity of 48,000 spectators in 1937. At the time, some considered it a "[[white elephant]]" because it was thought that it could never be filled. The term also alluded to the charges of corruption against the administration of Arturo Alessandri, which oversaw the stadium's costly construction.&lt;ref&gt;Brenda Elsey, Citizens and Sportsmen: Futbol and Politics in Twentieth Century Chile (Austin: University of Texas Press, 2011)&lt;/ref&gt;

For the [[1962 FIFA World Cup]], seating capacity was increased to 74,000 with overflow areas allowing for a total of more than 80,000 people, by eliminating the cycling track that was moved to another location. Over the years, seating capacity was reduced to keep escape routes clear and prevent accidents.

For the [[2000 World Junior Championships in Athletics]], the installation of individual seats was required, which reduced capacity to 66,000 spectators. This requirement ensured that the stadium could not exceed capacity, as seen with the visit of [[Pope John Paul II]] in 1987 (believed to be attended by more than 90,000 people, though no accurate measurement could be taken as attendance was free, with no control), or the closing of the Telethon. The official capacity of the stadium as of 2014 is 48,665.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.stadiumguide.com/nacionaldechile/|title=Estadio Nacional de Chile|work=The Stadium Guide|accessdate=31 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''EuroLeague MVP''', or '''EuroLeague Full Season MVP''', is the [[EuroLeague awards|award]] bestowed to the player that is deemed to be the "[[MVP|Most Valuable Player]]" during the full season of the [[EuroLeague]]. The EuroLeague is the [[European professional club basketball system|top-tier level European-wide]] men's professional club [[basketball]] league in Europe. The award has existed and been awarded by the EuroLeague since the [[Euroleague 2004-05|2004–05 season]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.euroleague.net/news/i/5ycw47oqktncu4e3/2014-15-bwin-mvp-nemanja-bjelica-fenerbahce-ulker-istanbul 2014-15 bwin MVP: Nemanja Bjelica, Fenerbahce Ulker Istanbul.]&lt;/ref&gt; It was originally awarded for play that included the league's regular season, top 16 stage, and playoffs, and currently is awarded for play that includes the regular season and playoffs, as the top 16 stage was eliminated.

So far, [[Anthony Parker]] is the only player who has won the award twice. Other than Parker, all the other winners of the award have been Europeans, with [[Luka Dončić]] being the most recent (and youngest) winner of the award for 2018.

==Selection criteria==
The EuroLeague MVP award is the first and only full season MVP award that is voted on and given by the EuroLeague. Previous awards like the [[EuroLeague Regular Season and Top 16 MVP]] awards were only for individual phases of the season, with the original regular season MVP award being based on the [[Performance Index Rating|PIR]] stat, rather than on an actual voting process. When the EuroLeague Full Season MVP award was created, those previous awards were phased out altogether, and were replaced by the [[EuroLeague MVP of the Month]] award.

The EuroLeague MVP award is based on a voting process. Currently, online fan voting represents 25% of the vote total for the MVP award, while media voting accounts for the remaining 75%. Team success is unofficially paramount during the selection process. Since established, the award has never gone to a player whose team did not reach the [[EuroLeague Final Four]]. It is nevertheless theoretically possible for that to occur in the future, as no rule stands against it. For example, players whose teams only made it to the top 16 stage of the competition (when it existed in the past), were nominated into the online fan voting every year, and some were selected to the [[All-EuroLeague Team|All-EuroLeague First Team]].

==History==
Starting with the [[2004–05 Euroleague|2004–05 season]], the [[EuroLeague]] officially began giving out its Full Season MVP award for the first time.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.euroleague.net/news/i/5ycw47oqktncu4e3/2014-15-bwin-mvp-nemanja-bjelica-fenerbahce-ulker-istanbul 2014-15 bwin MVP: Nemanja Bjelica, Fenerbahce Ulker Istanbul.]&lt;/ref&gt; Unlike the previous [[EuroLeague Regular Season and Top 16 MVP]] awards, this award encompasses the full season of EuroLeague, up until the [[EuroLeague Final Four]] stage. Also, rather than being based on the [[Performance Index Ranking|PIR]] statistical formula, like the earlier EuroLeague Regular Season MVP award, the Full Season MVP award is based on a combination of online voting by fans and the media. The online fan vote comprises 25% of the vote total, while the media vote encompasses 75% of the vote total.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1255">'''Fiji Football Referees Association''' (FFRA) is a professional organisation representing soccer referees in [[Fiji]]. It is affiliated to the [[Fiji Football Association]].

FFRA was formed in 1954, with Shiu Nath Sharma as the founding President, Ram Sundar Bansraj as the vice-president and Mohammed Ishaque as the secretary. Prior to 1954, referees were chosen from a pool referees who had shown ability in refereeing games. In 1961, referees wore the black uniform for the first time. In 1969, the first exams were conducted for referees. In the mid 1970s, FFRA aligned itself with international standards and a number of local referees were listed as [[FIFA]] referees. FIFA conducted a development program in [[Suva]] in 1977. In 1978 a Board of Examiners was appointed who conducted regular examinations for referees. In recent times, requirements to be appointed a referee in Fiji has been made more stringent and many FFRa referees have been appointed to the [[Oceania Football Confederation]].

'''''Gasketball''''' is an [[action game|action]] [[sports video game]] for the [[iPad]] by [[Mikengreg]], an independent development team of Michael Boxleiter and [[Greg Wohlwend]]. Players flick basketballs through 2D physics puzzles into the hoop in single-player, local multiplayer, and asynchronous [[Variations of basketball#H-O-R-S-E|HORSE]]-style online multiplayer modes. The game is free-to-play with in-app purchases. Development began in mid 2011 following Mikengreg's successful ''[[Solipskier]]''. They were able to live from the earnings for ''Gasketball''{{'s}} two year development at their previous salary, which afforded them the stability to try new avenues and reject prototypes, though they worked 100-hour weeks. Towards the end of their development, they ran out of money and lived on the couches of friends. It was released on August 9, 2012, and the game did not reach their desired conversion rate at the time of launch.

The game received "generally favorable" reviews, according to video game review score aggregator [[Metacritic]].&lt;ref name=Metacritic/&gt; ''[[Pocket Gamer]]'' gave the game their silver award, and [[Tim Rogers (journalist)|Tim Rogers]] of ''[[Kotaku]]'' named ''Gasketball'' his 2012 game of the year, calling it "the beginning of the hardcore social game genre".&lt;ref name="Kotaku: Rogers"/&gt;

== Gameplay ==

''Gasketball'' is a part-basketball, part-puzzler shot-matching [[sports video game]] where players flick basketballs through 2D physics puzzles (with flippers, portals, circular saw blades,&lt;ref name="Edge review"/&gt; and gravity switches&lt;ref name="Pocket Gamer review"/&gt;) into a basketball hoop. Some puzzles include banking the basketball shot off multiple surfaces before making the basket. In the [[Variations of basketball#H-O-R-S-E|HORSE]]-style games, the player must match the exact setup of the opponent's shot, such as hitting the floor before entering the hoop.&lt;ref name="TouchArcade review"/&gt; In the campaign, players get more points for making the shot without retrying,&lt;ref name="TouchArcade review"/&gt; and have five attempts to make the hoop before moving to the next level shamefully.&lt;ref name="Pocket Gamer review"/&gt; Players are awarded medals for the quality of their performance at the end of each chapter. Gold medals unlock new modes of play in the chapter. Every chapter has a unique theme, such as a construction site or outer space.&lt;ref name="TouchArcade review"/&gt;

The game has local two-player multiplayer with a divided [[iPad]] screen, and asynchronous online multiplayer where players construct levels for their opponents to complete.&lt;ref name="Edge review"/&gt; Players spin a wheel at the beginning of their turn to determine how many hazards they get to place via [[drag and drop]].&lt;ref name="TouchArcade review"/&gt; A few of the items are unlocked at first, and more are available with progress through the game or in-app purchases.&lt;ref name="Pocket Gamer review"/&gt; ''Gasketball'' uses a colorful palette and features a cranky robot,&lt;ref name="Edge review"/&gt; who provides a tutorial and resets the ball.&lt;ref name="Pocket Gamer review"/&gt; It was released as free-to-play with the tutorial unlocked, and four to five chapters available as additional paid downloads.&lt;ref name="TouchArcade review"/&gt;

''Gasketball'' was developed and produced by [[Mikengreg]],&lt;ref name="Pocket Gamer review"/&gt; an Iowa-based two-man team: Michael Boxleiter and [[Greg Wohlwend]].&lt;ref name="PA: Going Broke"/&gt; After releasing their first game,&lt;ref name="PA: Going Broke"/&gt; the sport-inspired ''[[Solipskier]]'' for [[iPhone]] and iPad,&lt;ref name="TouchArcade review"/&gt; Boxleiter and Wohlwend lived off the profits for two years while working on ''Gasketball'',&lt;ref name="PA: Going Broke"/&gt; paying themselves their same salaries from their [[Adobe Flash]] development days but having the security to try new ideas.&lt;ref name="TouchArcade: On Success"/&gt; Wohlwend made somewhat more income due to other collaborations, such as ''[[Puzzlejuice]]'' with [[Asher Vollmer]], but shared his income with Boxleiter.&lt;ref name="PA: Going Broke"/&gt; Development began in mid 2011.&lt;ref name="MG: announce"/&gt; Even though ''Solipskier'' was successful, the duo did not have a following comparable to indie developers like [[Team Meat]] and thus did not feel pressured to meet high expectations. Instead, their pressure was internal.&lt;ref name="TouchArcade: On Success"/&gt; Wohlwend said he worked 100-hour weeks with no weekends or vacations while living on the ''Solipskier'' funds. When they ran out of money, Boxleiter borrowed money from his parents, and eventually they both went homeless, living on the couches of friends.&lt;ref name="PA: Going Broke"/&gt;

{{quote box|quote=It can get very nerve-wracking to think that you only have one shot at releasing each game, and every time you fail to reach your goals you get one step closer to having to quit trying.|source= —Boxleiter to ''TouchArcade'', March 2012&lt;ref name="TouchArcade: On Success"/&gt; |width=30em |quoted=1 |align=left }}

In making ''Gasketball'', Boxleiter and Wohlwend felt that their game quality had been improving over time, though designing for a million-person audience was "daunting" and Wohlwend questioned whether he could even recreate ''Solipskier''{{'s}} success.&lt;ref name="TouchArcade: On Success"/&gt; The former game was designed in fits of creativity while the latter had no such moments, and took longer to produce. They discarded "everything" multiple times during their prototyping process with the understanding that anything less than what they wanted would lead to a subpar end result.&lt;ref name="TouchArcade: On Success"/&gt;{{efn|Wohlwend estimated about six "fairly polished prototypes" discarded.&lt;ref name="TouchArcade: On Success"/&gt;}} Boxleiter had difficulty accepting praise towards the end of development, considering the weight of having to leave the industry if the many 100-hour weeks did not pan out in an accepted product.&lt;ref name="TouchArcade: On Success"/&gt;

Mikengreg first announced the game on March 1, 2012,&lt;ref name="MG: announce"/&gt; and it was later released for iPad&lt;ref name="Edge review"/&gt; on August 9, 2012.&lt;ref name=Metacritic/&gt; Mikengreg decided to release the game as free-to-play for the base game with in-app purchases for the extended content. Wohlwend saw that a quarter of the top grossing games on iOS used in-app purchases (albeit with predatory practices) and felt that they could follow the model with a more ethical strategy: free to play, but pay once to unlock forever. Wohlwend later remarked that, "So far, humanity is proving to us that we can't have it both ways."&lt;ref name="PA: Going Broke"/&gt; They were told by friends that the purchase function was too hidden, which they later fixed.&lt;ref name="PA: Going Broke"/&gt; Journalists had noted the difficulty in purchasing the full version as well.&lt;ref name="TouchArcade: IAP"/&gt; ''Gasketball'' had been downloaded 200,000 times in its August 2012 launch week and was briefly ranked near the top of an iTunes top downloads ranking, though it did not break the top 200 grossing chart. The game's conversion rate from its free-to-play base package to the paid version was 0.67%—lower than their goal of at least 2% of an estimated five million downloads.&lt;ref name="PA: Going Broke"/&gt; The paid addition includes 100 additional levels and 10 new objects.&lt;ref name="TouchArcade: IAP"/&gt;

The game received "generally favorable" reviews, according to video game review score aggregator [[Metacritic]].&lt;ref name=Metacritic/&gt; Reviewers noted the game's character&lt;ref name="TouchArcade review"/&gt; and creative vision.&lt;ref name="TouchArcade review"/&gt; ''[[Pocket Gamer]]'' gave the game their silver award.&lt;ref name="Pocket Gamer review"/&gt; ''Gasketball'' was [[Tim Rogers (journalist)|Tim Rogers]] of ''[[Kotaku]]''{{'s}} 2012 game of the year.&lt;ref name="Kotaku: Rogers"/&gt;

''Edge'' noted Mikengreg's deft ability with simple sound effects, citing their previous work with ''Solipskier''. They praised the "sweet and personable" art design and the mix of "freewheeling creativity with arcade precision". ''Edge'' also praised the addition of the "decent" single-player campaign alongside the multiplayer.&lt;ref name="Edge review"/&gt; ''Pocket Gamer''{{'s}} Harry Slater called the single-player "entertaining" but felt the asynchronous multiplayer was the highlight.&lt;ref name="Pocket Gamer review"/&gt; ''TouchArcade''{{'s}} Brad Nicholson called the game a cross between ''[[Amazing Alex]]'' and ''[[NBA Jam (2010 video game)|NBA Jam]]''. While he found some puzzle designs imbalanced, Nicholson also felt that the interactions between the flipper and portal hazards were "surprisingly solid" and noted the game's lighthearted "welcome playground sort of feel" even as the easy learning curve reached [[Rube Goldberg]]-like complexity.&lt;ref name="TouchArcade review"/&gt; Tim Rogers of ''Kotaku'' called ''Gasketball'' the "inverse Rube Goldberg" and "the beginning of the hardcore social game genre, of asynchronous gameplay as meaningful as [[first-person shooter|FPS]] [[deathmatches]]".&lt;ref name="Kotaku: Rogers"/&gt;{{efn|[[Bennett Foddy]] of ''[[QWOP]]'' originally recommended ''Gasketball'' to Rogers after hearing about ''[[TNNS]]'' and Rogers's future game development plans.&lt;ref name="Gamasutra: touching"/&gt;}}

'''[[Indonesia]]''' competed at the '''[[1976 Summer Olympics]]''' in [[Montreal|Montreal, Quebec]], Canada.

==Results by event==

===[[Archery at the 1976 Summer Olympics|Archery]]===
In Indonesia's second Olympic archery competition, one man and one woman competed.  Only one point separated the scores of the two athletes, though the 2352 points that [[Leane Suniar]] received placed her far higher in the women's ranking than the 2353 points that counterpart [[Donald Pandiangan]] received placed him.

'''Women's Individual Competition''':

'''Kickers''' is a youth brand created in 1970 in [[France]] that produces a wide range of [[footwear]] and clothing. Kickers was bought in 2007 by the Royer group.

== History ==
&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[Image:Kickersshoes2.JPG|200px|thumb|Kickers shoes 1980]] --&gt;

On the French scene in 1970, Daniel Raufast came across a poster advertising the musical ''[[Hair (musical)|Hair]]''. Interested by all the barefooted youngsters wearing jeans, he developed a new shoe concept which he believed to be more compatible with the blue-jean generation. The designer Jacques Chevallereau then created the first 'jean boot'. This new shoe was very different: the use of [[nubuck]]; shapes that looked more like short boots than regular shoes; tough crepe soles made with [[natural rubber]], [[grommet|eyelets]], contrast stitching, panels and appliqués all obviously referencing [[denim]]. The success was such that, within one season, Kickers production capacity grew from 300 to 12,000 pairs per month. Immediately successful in France, then Germany, by 1974, Kickers were selling in over 70 countries.

=== United Kingdom ===
&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[Image:Kickersshowtags.JPG|200px|thumb|Kickers shoes tags]] --&gt;

During the 1980s Kickers shoes become very successful in Britain. So much so in some case, children were queuing up until 10 o'clock at night waiting upon deliveries, and when the delivery did arrive the stock would be gone in a flash. Many children also collected the ''flower shape'' tag and did not believe the shoes were real Kickers unless this tag was included.&lt;ref&gt;BBC: ''I love 1980'' TV programmes&lt;/ref&gt;

== Kick Hi ==
The Kick Hi boot was released in 1975.

== Music industry popularity ==
It was in the late 1980s and early 1990s that Kickers really gained popularity when Kick His were heralded by icons on the [[Manchester]] music scene. The Kick Hi then became popular in the [[rave]] scene, first with [[acid house]] and then later with [[trance music]]. Many fans of the shoe came from diverse and contemporary musical backgrounds including [[UK garage]], [[Rhythm and blues|RnB]], [[Pop music|pop]] and [[Hip hop music|hip hop]].

== Popular culture ==
Over the years, Kickers has been associated with the music industry, including [[Ms Dynamite]], [[So Solid Crew]], [[Jarvis Cocker]], [[Noel Gallagher]], [[The Streets|Mike Skinner]], [[Arctic Monkeys]], [[Craig David]] and [[Rodney P]]. 

[[Ian Brown]] famously kicked off the trend by wearing a pair of Kick His to [[The Haçienda]] as a cheeky retort to the strict 'no trainer policy'. [[The Stone Roses]] wore them in their video for '[[Fools Gold/What The World Is Waiting For|Fools Gold]]'. A sheep sported a pair of Kick His on the cover of the '[[Stepping Stone (The Farm song)|Stepping Stone]]' 12-inch single by ''[[The Farm (British band)|The Farm]]''.

Kickers sponsored the [[Urban Music Awards]] (UMA) 2007 and had an advertorial with [[NME]] which ended in September 2007.

'''Lesser Hampden''' is a football stadium in [[Glasgow]], Scotland, which is located immediately beside the western end of [[Hampden Park]] stadium.

In 1923, [[Queen's Park F.C.|Queen's Park]] were looking for an alternative venue for their reserves and youth teams.&lt;ref name = "shadow"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://spfl.co.uk/news/article/by-stephen-halliday/ |title=Lesser Hampden - Living in the Shadow |first=Stephen |last=Halliday |work=www.spfl.co.uk |publisher=Scottish Professional Football League |date=23 December 2005 |accessdate=3 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The club purchased a [[farm]] on the west side of [[Hampden Park]] and built a pitch and stands.&lt;ref name = "shadow"/&gt; When it opened in 1924, Lesser Hampden had a capacity of 12,000.&lt;ref name = "shadow"/&gt; To reduce costs, the original farmhouse building was retained and was converted into a [[pavilion]] and [[dressing room]].&lt;ref name = "shadow"/&gt; This farmhouse, which dates back to the 19th century, is believed by football historians to be the oldest existing football stadium building in the world.&lt;ref name = "shadow"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.scottishfootballleague.com/news/article/queens-park-to-build-solid-new-foundations/ | title = Queen's Park to build solid new foundations | accessdate = 2013-04-19 | date = 4 May 2012 | publisher = [[Scottish Football League]] | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20120519201149/http://www.scottishfootballleague.com/news/article/queens-park-to-build-solid-new-foundations/ | archivedate = 19 May 2012 | df = dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = "closed"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://spfl.co.uk/news/article/queens-park-lose-unique-world-record/ |title=Queen's Park lose unique record |work=www.spfl.co.uk |publisher=Scottish Professional Football League |date=3 October 2013 |accessdate=3 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The changing rooms were closed in 2013 for safety reasons.&lt;ref name = "closed"/&gt;

During [[World War II]], Lesser Hampden was commandeered by the [[British Government]] to serve as a base for the [[British Home Guard|Home Guard]].&lt;ref name = "shadow"/&gt; There were proposals to convert the site back to agriculture if there were food shortages, but the ground was returned to the football club at the end of the war in 1945.&lt;ref name = "shadow"/&gt;

During the 1970s, several Queen's Park first team games were played at the stadium. During the redevelopment of the main Hampden Park stadium in the 1990s, the club played [[Scottish Football League]] matches at this ground.&lt;ref name = "shadow"/&gt; In 2002, it was discovered that Lesser Hampden was tainted with toxic [[chromium]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/scotland/1874911.stm |title=Toxic waste found near Hampden |work=BBC News |publisher=BBC |date=15 March 2002 |accessdate=3 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; a byproduct from an old [[Shawfield|chemicals plant]] located in nearby [[Rutherglen]]. This was cleaned up at a cost of around £40,000.&lt;ref name = "shadow"/&gt; The ground served as a staging area for pre-game [[tailgate party|tailgate parties]] hosted by the [[Scottish Claymores]] [[American football]] team when they played at Hampden Park.

Lesser Hampden is now tightly hemmed in by surrounding housing and commercial developments. It has some areas of terracing, floodlights and a small covered grandstand adjacent to the original farmhouse building. The natural grass pitch was replaced with a 3rd generation astro-grass pitch, and was used as a warm-up area for athletes competing in the [[2014 Commonwealth Games]], as the track and field events were held at Hampden Park.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/19834277 |title=Hampden will be closed to football for Glasgow 2014 preparations |first=John |last=Barnes |work=BBC Sport |publisher=BBC |date=4 October 2012 |accessdate=3 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In September 2018 it was announced that Queen's Park would return to Lesser Hampden to play first team matches on a permanent basis after agreeing to sell Hampden Park itself to the [[Scottish FA]], who had been leasing the larger ground as the base for the national team.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Hampden v Murrayfield: Scottish FA opt to keep games in Glasgow |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/45344645 |accessdate=11 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''mohawk''' is a turn in [[figure skating]] that involves a change of foot but not a change of edge.  It can be done on either inside or outside edges.  

The most common mohawk turn is the forward inside open mohawk.  In this turn, the skater faces into the circle and the free foot is brought to the instep of the skating foot at an angle of 90° or more, before being placed on the ice on a backward inside edge during the transfer of weight.  This leaves the former skating foot (and new free foot) in front of the new skating foot after the turn.  Along with the [[3 turn]], this is the most common way for skaters to change direction while skating, and is one of the first turns learned by beginning skaters.

In a closed mohawk, the transfer of weight happens with the free foot being placed behind the skating foot rather than at the instep, so that after the turn the new free foot is carried behind rather than in front.  

Outside mohawks are similar, except that the skater faces outside of the circle.  Again, there are both open and closed variants.  

Mohawk turns are essentially executed with crossed feet, and this is reflected in the tracings.  In a good mohawk turn, the weight transfer is executed smoothly, without jerking of the hips or upper body.  It is somewhat easier to accomplish this if the skater has open hip joints and can turn out the free foot at a greater angle before placing it on the ice, but lack of flexibility can be compensated for with careful timing.

The corresponding turns from backward to forward do not involve crossed feet and are usually considered simple steps rather than mohawks.

Gabre Gabric's daughter, Lyana Calvesi (born 1944), is a former athlete who afterward assumed the role of manager of several [[Masters athletics]] teams and before founding the athletic master club, ''Atletica Calvesi''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fidal.it/calendario/IX-MEETING-SANDRO-CALVESI-/COD3348|title=IX MEETING "SANDRO CALVESI"|publisher=fidal.it|language=Italian|date=1 July 2012|accessdate=25 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; She married [[Eddy Ottoz]] (born 1944), a former Italian [[hurdling|hurdler]] (bronze medal in [[1968 Summer Olympics]] and 5 times [[European Athletics Championships|European champion]]) before becoming the manager of the [[Italian National Olympic Committee]] from 2001.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sportvda.it/politica-premi-e-corsi/386-eddy-ottoz-confermato-nella-giunta-del-qconiq-per-la-terza-volta-insieme-a-gianni-petrucci-ancora-presidente|title=Eddy Ottoz confermato nella Giunta del "Coni" per la terza volta insieme a Gianni Petrucci, ancora presidente|publisher=sportvda.it|language=italian|accessdate=22 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;  He represented Italy at the [[Athletics at the 1964 Summer Olympics|1964 Summer Olympics]] held in [[Tokyo]], [[Japan]], and the [[Athletics at the 1968 Summer Olympics|1968 Summer Olympics]] held in [[Mexico City]], [[Mexico]], where he won the bronze medal in the 110-metre hurdles event.

The couple had three children. [[Laurent Ottoz]] (born 1970) is a former Italian hurdler and member of [[Federazione Italiana di Atletica Leggera|FIDAL]] committee. In 1994 26 years after his father, Laurent Ottoz, broke the national record by completing the [[110 metres hurdles]] in 13:42&amp;nbsp;seconds in [[Berlin]]. After this he changed event to the [[400 metres hurdles]].

The '''Prix Jean Prat''' is a [[Conditions races|Group 1]] [[Flat racing|flat]] [[Horse racing|horse race]] in [[France]] open to three-year-old [[thoroughbred]] [[Colt (horse)|colts]] and [[Filly|fillies]]. It is run at [[Chantilly Racecourse|Chantilly]] over a distance of 1,600 metres (about 1 mile), and it is scheduled to take place each year in early July.

==History==
The event was established in 1858. It was originally the opening leg of a two-part series called the Prix Biennal. The second leg, for horses aged four or older, was first run in 1859. Both races were staged at [[Longchamp Racecourse|Longchamp]].

The three-year-olds' division of the Prix Biennal was run over 2,000 metres. For a period it was held in April, and it served as a trial for the [[Prix du Jockey Club]].

Both Prix Biennal races were renamed the Prix Jean Prat in 1940. This was in memory of Jean Prat (1847–1940), a successful racehorse owner and breeder.

The version for three-year-olds was switched to late May or early June in 1961. It was shortened to 1,850 metres in 1962. It was transferred to Chantilly and cut to 1,800 metres in 1967. The present system of race grading was introduced in 1971, and for several years the event held Group 2 status.

The race was promoted to Group 1 level in 1985. From this point the version for older horses was known as the [[Prix Vicomtesse Vigier]]. The Prix Jean Prat returned to Longchamp in 1986.

The event started its current period at Chantilly in 1995. It was cut to 1,600 metres and moved to early July in 2005.

U.S. national anthem protests (2016–present)}}[[Image:DetroitLionsvsGreenBayPackers-2007-FavreKneel.jpg|thumb|right|The Green Bay Packers (right) in the [[kneel]] formation in a game against the Detroit Lions in 2007|330px]]
In [[American football]], a '''quarterback kneel''', also called '''taking a knee''', '''genuflect offense''',{{Cn|date=August 2018}} or '''victory formation''' occurs when the [[quarterback]] immediately [[kneels]] to the ground, [[American football rules#Downed player|ending the play on contact]], after receiving the [[snap (football)|snap]]. It is primarily used to [[running out the clock|run the clock down]], either at the end of the first half or the game itself, in order to preserve a lead or a win. Although it generally results in a loss of a yard and uses up a [[Down (gridiron football)|down]], it minimizes the risk of a [[fumble]], which would give the other team a chance at recovering the ball.

Especially when the outcome of the game has been well decided, defenses will often give little resistance to the play as a matter of sportsmanship as well as to reduce the risk of injuries, penalties and possible supplemental discipline (the latter considerations being increasingly important as referees and leagues more strictly enforce penalties against perceived unnecessary roughness on quarterbacks and against headshots in general) on what is a relatively simple play. The quarterback is generally not touched and the act of intentionally taking the knee results in the play being over in all variations of the sport.

The formation offers maximum protection against a fumble; should the center-quarterback exchange result in a fumble, a running back is lined up on either side of the quarterback, both to recover any fumble and protect the vulnerable kneeling player from being injured by defensive players who get through the line. Also, a player is lined up directly behind the quarterback, often much farther than a typical tailback would line up. This player's responsibility is to tackle any defensive player who may recover a fumble and attempt to advance it. Because of this essentially "defensive" responsibility, the tailback in this formation may actually be a free safety or other defensive player who is adept at making tackles in the open field.

Even though the play itself takes very little time, the rules of [[American football]] dictate that it does not stop the game clock (as with any play where the ball carrier is tackled in bounds). With the 40-second play clock in the NFL and NCAA, along with the [[two-minute warning]] in the NFL, a team can run off over two minutes with three straight kneel-downs if the defensive team has no more timeouts. The winning team can storm the field if up to 40 seconds remains in the game (30 in [[Alliance of American Football]]), to let coaches shake hands with each other. (In the AAF, as many as three straight "victory formations" from 90 seconds left in regulation can be done.)

The play is often known as a "victory formation", as it is most often run by a winning team late in the game in order to preserve a victory. In the case of a close game, the winning team would be trying to avoid a turnover which might be the result of a more complex play. In the case of a more lopsided contest where the winning team's overall [[point differential]] has no prospect of affecting their playoff qualification prospects, the play can be run as a matter of sportsmanship (since the winning team foregoes the opportunity to [[running up the score|run up the score]]) and to avoid further injuries and/or penalties. In terms of statistics, a kneel by the quarterback is typically recorded as a rushing attempt for &amp;minus;1 or &amp;minus;2 yards.

Other sports also use the term "victory formation" for a play designed only to run down the clock with little chance of injury, such as a Jammer in [[roller derby]] skating behind or only lightly challenging the pack while the final seconds of the bout tick down.

==Strategy==
The quarterback kneel is mainly used when the team in the lead has possession of the ball with less than two minutes on the game clock. With the 40-second play clock in the NFL and NCAA, two minutes (120 seconds) is in theory the maximum amount of time that can be run off on three consecutive quarterback kneels; this assumes it is first down and the defense has no timeouts remaining. A team cannot run more than three consecutive quarterback kneels as doing so on fourth down turns the ball over to the opponent and guarantees them at least one opportunity to score. The decision to run the quarterback kneel depends on the amount of time remaining in the game, the down, and the number of timeouts the defense has remaining. For example, if there is one minute remaining on the game clock on first down, and the defense has one timeout left, the offense may use two successive quarterback kneels to completely run out the clock, and if the defense uses its timeout the offense can simply run a third kneel to run out the clock. However, if there is one minute remaining on the game clock on ''third'' down, then regardless of how many timeouts the defense has, quarterback kneels will not completely run out the clock and the offense must try to make a first down. AAF allows this to happen if up to 90 seconds remain; there's a 30-second play clock.

The quarterback kneel is also often used at the end of the first half by a team which feels they have little chance of scoring before halftime due to poor field position. It is also sometimes run at the end of the second half of a tie game by a team content with sending the game into overtime. Less commonly, the play is sometimes run at the end of the game by a losing team which is hopelessly behind and wishes to avoid injury, but is unwilling to cut the game short by [[forfeit (sport)|forfeiting]]. 

A team that is in field-goal range and either tied on the score or trailing by 1 or 2 points can also use one or more kneeldowns in order to run time off the clock before attempting a field goal. A quarterback in this situation may also run several yards to his left or right before kneeling down in order to get a more favorable spot for the field goal attempt, in order to try and get the ball closer to the goal line and/or to get the ball to a particular set of hash marks if the team's kicker prefers to kick from a specific side of the field. Ideally, the clock would run out during the field goal attempt, thereby preventing the opposing team from getting an opportunity to score again.

In several instances (including twice by the [[2017 Philadelphia Eagles season|Philadelphia Eagles]] in the [[2017 NFL season]]), a quarterback kneel has been purposefully initiated on a [[Conversion (gridiron football)|point after touchdown]] try at the end of the game after a game-winning or defensive touchdown was scored at the end of regulation; NFL rules used to require the try to be executed between the offense and defense, even if the offense intends to decline the unnecessary points to avoid further insulting or annoying their opponent. This occurred prominently in the 2018 "[[Minneapolis Miracle]]", where eight [[2017 New Orleans Saints season|New Orleans Saints]] players on offense and defense had to return to the field from the locker room to 'oppose' the try against the victorious [[2017 Minnesota Vikings season|Minnesota Vikings]] after referee imploration to complete the try. Quarterback [[Case Keenum]] merely knelt the ball down before tossing it in the air and celebrating the Viking victory, with the Saints giving no effort to strip the ball (as a defensive runback for a two-point conversion would not have assured a tie or victory).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/news/watch-case-keenum-leads-skol-chant-after-throwing-game-winning-td-in-playoffs/|title=Case Keenum leads Skol chant after throwing game-winning TD in playoffs|last=Blackburn|first=Pete|date=14 January 2018|publisher=[[CBS Sports]]|accessdate=15 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The rule was changed for 2018 onward, to omit the try if it would have no impact on the outcome of the game. 

In rare instances, a team will use the quarterback kneel to avoid [[running up the score]] in a lopsided contest, even though there may be significant time remaining on the clock. This occurred in the 2011 edition of the [[Magnolia Bowl]] between the [[2011 LSU Tigers football team|LSU Tigers]] and [[2011 Ole Miss Rebels football team|Ole Miss Rebels]]. With five minutes remaining and LSU leading 52–3, Tigers' head coach [[Les Miles]] ordered third-string quarterback [[Zach Mettenberger]] to kneel on first and goal from the Ole Miss one-yard line, and to kneel on the next three plays. Miles felt another touchdown would further embarrass Ole Miss coach [[Houston Nutt]], who announced his resignation, effective at the end of the season, 12 days before the Rebels hosted first-ranked LSU. The Tigers had already secured the largest margin of victory in series history.

In [[Canadian football]], which use slightly different rules, kneeling with time left is not necessarily a viable strategy. Unlike in American football, in Canadian football every quarter must end with a play even in situations where the game clock expires after the end of the previous play. However, a quarterback kneel is by far the most common play for winning teams to run with ''"zeros on the clock"'' at the end of a game, barring exceptional (but not unheard-of) situations where the head-to-head point differential in the opposing teams' season series (a key factor in tiebreakers) remains in doubt.

==History==
Prior to the mid-1970s, teams leading in the final moments of games generally ran quarterback sneaks (which brought the risk of injuries on low-yardage plays) or dive plays to the fullbacks or other running backs to run time off the clock, as some coaches considered kneeling cowardly or even unsportsmanlike. However, the [[Miracle at the Meadowlands]], on November 19, {{nfly|1978}}, in which defensive back [[Herman Edwards]] of the visiting [[1978 Philadelphia Eagles season|Philadelphia Eagles]] recovered a botched handoff between quarterback [[Joe Pisarcik]] and running back [[Larry Csonka]] of the [[1978 New York Giants season|New York Giants]], provided a nationally-televised spur for change.  

With 31 seconds remaining, the Giants led 17–12 and the Eagles were out of timeouts.&lt;ref name=sivrup&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.si.com/vault/1978/11/27/106773446/a-roundup-of-the-week-nov-1319 |magazine=Sports Illustrated |last=Chen |first=Albert |title=A roundup of the week Nov 13-19: pro football |date=November 27, 1978 |page=116}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=sivfum&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.si.com/vault/2001/07/02/306829/the-fumble-it-was-one-of-the-great-blunders-in-nfl-history-all-the-giants-had-to-do-was-run-out-the-clock-instead-they-unleashed-a-disaster-that-altered-the-course-of-several-careers |magazine=Sports Illustrated |last=Chen |first=Albert |title=The fumble |date=July 2, 2001 |page=116}}&lt;/ref&gt; As Pisarcik attempted to hand it to [[Larry Csonka]], it was awkwardly fumbled; Edwards scooped it up and ran it 26 yards for the Eagles' improbable {{nowrap|19–17 victory.&lt;ref name=fplnmr&gt;{{cite news |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=fvQhAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=naAFAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=6100%2C8133172 |work=Reading Eagle |location=(Pennsylvania) |agency=Associated Press |title=Final play nightmare |date=November 20, 1978 |page=29}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=alnyny&gt;{{cite news |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=m0UuAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=MlkEAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=4969%2C2761929 |work=Pittsburgh Press |agency=UPI |title=Alas, New York, New York |date=November 20, 1978 |page=B=6 }}&lt;/ref&gt;}} The play generated tremendous controversy, ridicule, and criticism toward the Giants nationwide and specifically offensive coordinator [[Bob Gibson (American football)|Bob Gibson]] for failing to use the supposedly foolproof quarterback-kneeldown play.

In the week following the game, both the Eagles and Giants developed specific formations designed to protect the quarterback behind three players as he fell on the ball. Previously, quarterbacks executing a similar "kill the clock" play simply ran a quarterback sneak from a tightly packed conventional offensive formation.  The Eagles made the [[1978–79 NFL playoffs|playoffs]] and the Giants finished at {{nowrap|6–10.}}

The "victory formation" spread rapidly throughout football at nearly all levels, as coaches sought to adopt a procedure for downing the ball in the final seconds which would reduce the risk of turnovers to the absolute minimum possible. Within a season or so, it had become nearly universal. In 1987 the NFL rule allowing quarterbacks to simply kneel and not have to fall down and risk a hit from the defense took effect.

==Defense==

Although in most instances a losing team will concede defeat when the other team is in the victory formation and taking the quarterback kneel, there are instances where the trailing team will try to make a defensive play in an attempt to regain possession of the ball, particularly when the losing team is behind by a touchdown or less and there is enough time to make more than one play.

[[Image:Post-Pisarcik QB kneel formation.svg|thumb|200px|right|Formation adopted for the quarterback kneel play after the Miracle at the Meadowlands]]
This had happened on the play preceding [[The Miracle at the Meadowlands]]. Due to the low percentage of turnovers caused, defenses generally do not attempt to disrupt the kneeldown as the Eagles did in 1978; a "gentlemen's agreement" emerged in which defenders did not rush the offensive team with high intensity, as long as the offense made no attempt to advance the ball.

One prominent exception occurred to another Giants quarterback in 2012. In Week 2, an interception of a [[Tampa Bay Buccaneers]] pass with six seconds left had apparently secured a 25-point fourth-quarter comeback and 41–34 Giant victory. However, in the ensuing "victory formation" play, instead of the usual nominal contact between the lineman, the Buccaneers stacked the line of scrimmage and forcefully pushed the Giants' line back in an attempt to cause Giants' QB [[Eli Manning]] to fumble.  Manning was knocked back by his own center as he took the snap and fell down. Giants coach [[Tom Coughlin]] angrily confronted his Tampa Bay counterpart, [[Greg Schiano]], at midfield once the game was over.&lt;ref&gt;Garafalo, Mike, "Coughlin to Schiano: 'You don't do that in this league'", ''[[USA Today]]'', September 17, 2012. Accessed September 17, 2012. [http://content.usatoday.com/communities/gameon/post/2012/09/16/coughlin-schiano-yelling/70000471/1#.UFdGmq5li6U]&lt;/ref&gt; Undaunted, Schiano employed a similar strategy the next week at the end of the Buccaneers' game against the [[Dallas Cowboys]].  In the [[2013 NFL season|next season]], with the Philadelphia Eagles leading the Buccaneers, [[Chip Kelly]] had [[quarterback]] [[Nick Foles]] attempt a [[shotgun formation]] kneeldown to avert Schiano's aggressive technique, which succeeded.

Aside from trying to attempt a defensive play, teams that are losing but behind by a touchdown or less in the final two minutes will sometimes use their time-outs if the team does a quarterback kneel. As teams are allowed three time-outs per half—the clock stops on a time out and restarts on the snap—they will try to preserve them for situations such as this, thereby forcing the winning team to run a play and gain a first down or, in the very least, take time off the clock. 

If there is still enough time left on the clock and the winning team attempts another quarterback kneel, the defensive team's strategy may repeat itself until it either runs out of time-outs, time runs out, or (most desirably) the team forces a punt or turnover, though in 2016, the [[Baltimore Ravens]], leading in a game against the [[Cincinnati Bengals]] after three plays, ran off the remaining twelve seconds of clock off in a punt formation with [[Sam Koch]] purposefully holding the ball in the end zone while multiple [[Holding (American football)|holding]] calls were made against the Ravens offense. The play ended with Koch touching his toe to the back end zone line after time expired and taking an intentional [[Safety (gridiron football score)|safety]] (offensive fouls at the end of the game do not result in a replay of a down, unlike their defensive equivalents). The intentional holding aspect of the play was made illegal after the 2016 NFL season.

A '''roll''' is the most basic and fundamental skill in gymnastics. There are many variations in the skill. Rolls are similar to [[Flip (acrobatic)|flips]] in the fact that they are a complete rotation of the body, but the rotation of the roll is usually made on the ground while a flip is made in the air with the hips passing over the head and without any hands touching the ground. Rolls also help recover from a fall safely.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Sands, Caine, Borms|first=Bill, Dennis John, Jan|title=Scientific Aspects of Women's Gymnastics:Volume 45 of Medicine and sport science, 0254-5020|year=2003|publisher=Karger Publishers|isbn=3805574762|page=27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The forward roll (colloquially called a roly poly) is one of the most basic elements in gymnastics and one of the first learnt.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sportacademy/hi/sa/special_events/gymnastics/newsid_3855000/3855893.stm|title=Take to the floor with Tweddle!|publisher=BBC Sport|date= 2004-07-13|accessdate=2010-11-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Sands, Caine, Borms|first=Bill, Dennis John, Jan|title=Scientific Aspects of Women's Gymnastics:Volume 45 of Medicine and sport science, 0254-5020|year=2003|publisher=Karger Publishers|isbn=3805574762|page=27}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The forward roll is started from a standing position and then the gymnast crouches down, places their hands shoulder wide apart and hands facing forward. They tuck their chin to their chest and place the back of their head onto the floor.&lt;ref name="Gymnastics - floor exercises"&gt;{{cite video| people=BBC Sports Academy| accessdate=2010-11-15| url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/learningzone/clips/6272.bb.wmv| title=Gymnastics - floor exercises| medium=Television production| location=UK| publisher=BBC Sports Academy}}{{dead link|date=April 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; They then push off of the floor with their legs and rotate over their head onto their back.

==Backward roll==
The backward roll is similar to the forward roll, but in reverse. The gymnast starts in a standing position and bends to a [[Squatting position|squat/sitting position]] with their arms in front. They then lower and lean back slightly until their bottom reaches the floor. They then continue this momentum and roll over their back onto their shoulders. They should then place their hands next to their shoulders and tuck their head into their chin. The hands then push the floor strongly and straighten their arms and continue to rotate their body over their head. The feet are then placed on the floor and the gymnast stands.&lt;ref name="Gymnastics - floor exercises"/&gt;

Variations:
*'''Backward roll to [[handstand]]''' - This is essentially the same as a backward roll, however when the hands make contact with the ground, they straighten fully and the body continues to straighten upwards into a handstand position.
*'''Backward roll on [[Rings (gymnastics)|rings]]''' - This is the same movement as a backward roll but it is performed on rings. It can also be used in a combination such as backwards roll to Maltese.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.intlgymnast.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=2127:mitchell-dominates-dtb-cup-with-three-golds&amp;catid=5:competition-reports&amp;Itemid=164|title=Mitchell Dominates DTB Cup with Three Golds|publisher=International Gymnast Magazine |date= |accessdate=2010-11-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*'''Shoulder roll''' – This is similar to a backward roll but the roll is performed over one shoulder rather than pushing with the arms and rolling over the head. This is more commonly performed in [[Rhythmic Gymnastics]], as it is faster and it also protects the hair.

==Sideways roll==
A sideways roll is also known as a log roll, barrel roll, or pencil roll. This can be started by lying down on the back or front with the body outstretched. The gymnast then rolls onto their side and does a complete rotation of the body, remaining parallel to the performing surface.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Human Kinetics|title=The Sports Rules Book|year=2009|publisher=Human Kinetics 1|isbn=1450408109|page=64}}&lt;/ref&gt; The log roll is a sideways roll with the hands next to the waist and the pencil roll is with the hands stretched above the head. A sideways roll can also be performed when a gymnast over-rotates or loses their balance in a vertical, forward or sideways direction.&lt;ref name=laban1&gt;Debby Mitchell, Barbara Davis, Raim Lopez (2009) "Teaching fundamental gymnastics skills", {{ISBN|0-7360-0124-7}}, Chapter 1: "Gymnastics Basics: Teaching Safely, Teaching Well", section "Side Rolls"&lt;/ref&gt;

==Tucked sideways roll==
A Tucked Sideways roll begins with the gymnast starting in a kneeling position, with the gymnast sitting back onto their heels with their head and arms in an outstretched position like the [[Balasana|child pose]] in yoga. From here, the gymnast rolls onto their side with their legs maintaining the tucked position and onto their knees again.&lt;ref name=laban2&gt;British Gymnastics (2009) "Gymnastics", {{ISBN|978-0-7136-8952-5}}, Chapter 8: "The Family of Rolls", section "Tucked Sideways Roll"&lt;/ref&gt;

==Tin soldier roll/Teddy bear roll==
This roll starts by sitting on the floor in a straddle position. The legs are held below the knees and the body leans over towards the shoulder on one side. The gymnast then folds more tightly until they roll over their back and return to a sitting straddle position.&lt;ref name=laban3&gt;British Gymnastics (2009) "Gymnastics", {{ISBN|978-0-7136-8952-5}}, Chapter 8: "The Family of Rolls", section "Tin Soldier Roll"&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://schools.norfolk.gov.uk/myportal/custom/files_uploaded/uploaded_resources/2303/gymaction_card1.doc|title=Gymnastic Resource Card 1S|publisher=|date=|accessdate=2010-11-21|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=http://webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk/20111011103737/http%3A//schools.norfolk.gov.uk/myportal/custom/files_uploaded/uploaded_resources/2303/gymaction_card1.doc|archivedate=2011-10-11|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Dive roll==

[[File:Dive Roll over Table.gif|thumb|right|Dive Roll Over Table]]
A [[dive roll]] is an acrobatic stunt that begins with a horizontal forward [[Diving (sport)|diving]] motion and results in a forward roll. Alternate forms such as a Jigaree are also notable. It is considered an advanced forward roll, demonstrating flight and a smooth landing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=LeBoeuf &amp; Butler|first=Maureen &amp; Lawrence|title=Fit and Active: The West Point Physical Development Program|year=2008|publisher=Human Kinetics 1, 2008|isbn=073606074X|page=36}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It is also used in other sports such as wrestling to reinforce the motion of landing correctly.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Cejudo &amp; Roth|first=Henry &amp; Jillian|title=Wrestling For Dummies|year=2012|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons|isbn=1118117972|pages=384}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Corporal]] '''Rosmini bin Haji Abdul Kahar''' (born 1 September 1979) is a [[Brunei]]an [[Association football|footballer]] who plays for [[Royal Brunei Police Sports Council|MS PDB]] as a [[Midfielder (association football)|midfielder]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Football - Brunei soccer teams unveiled|url=http://www.e-borneo.com/cgi-bin/np/viewnews.cgi?category=2&amp;id=986357099|date=4 April 2001|publisher=[[Borneo Bulletin]]|accessdate=5 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; He also played in the [[Malaysian football league system|Malaysian leagues]] for the [[Brunei (Malaysia Premier League team)|Brunei M-League representative team]] and later [[Brunei DPMM FC]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Perak FC Juara Grup di Depan 200 Penonton|url=http://www.suaramerdeka.com/harian/0307/16/ora4.htm|date=16 July 2003|publisher=[[Suara Merdeka]]|accessdate=5 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Club career==
Rosmini, a career policeman, played as a left-sided midfielder for the football team of the [[Royal Brunei Police Force]]. His performances in the international scene caught the eye of [[Mick Jones (footballer, born 1947)|Mick Jones]] who drafted him into the [[Brunei (Malaysia Premier League team)|Brunei M-League squad]] in 2001.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=M-League - Norsillmy, Rosmini to bolster Brunei|url=http://www.e-borneo.com/cgi-bin/np/viewnews.cgi?category=2&amp;id=991371837|date=1 June 2001|publisher=Borneo Bulletin|accessdate=5 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; He scarcely played for the Wasps due to work commitments and his preference to play at domestic club level for [[Brunei DPMM FC]] who signed him in 2003.&lt;ref name="eteamz"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eteamz.com/dpmmfc/news/|publisher=eteamz.com|title=DPMM FC: My Site News|accessdate=5 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; He won the [[Brunei Premier League]] in [[2004 Brunei Premier League|2004]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.brudirect.com/DailyInfo/News/Archive/Oct04/141004/nite19.htm|title=Undefeated DPMM FC Takes Home Crown|publisher=Borneo Bulletin|date=14 October 2004|deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20050107001810/http://www.brudirect.com/DailyInfo/News/Archive/Oct04/141004/nite19.htm|archivedate=7 January 2005|accessdate=5 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; His solitary goal for Brunei came in a 1–1 draw against [[Kedah FA|Kedah]] on 20 March 2005.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Malaysia 2005|url=http://www.rsssf.com/tablesm/malay05.html|date=1 July 2006|publisher=Rec.Sport.Soccer Statistics Foundation|accessdate=8 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A year later, Rosmini's club moved to the [[Malaysia Premier League]] for the [[2005–06 Malaysia Premier League|2005–06 season]] to replace Brunei.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.brudirect.com/DailyInfo/News/Archive/Dec05/031205/nite21.htm|title=Brunei DPMM FC Players Sign Contract |publisher=Borneo Bulletin|date=5 December 2005|deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20051205004846/http://www.brudirect.com/DailyInfo/News/Archive/Dec05/031205/nite21.htm|archivedate=5 December 2005|accessdate=5 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; DPMM immediately won promotion, and in [[2006–07 Malaysia Super League|the following season]], finished third in Malaysia's top tier. Unfortunately, he was axed along with [[Affendy Akup]] and [[Zulkefly Duraman]] to make way for four Malaysian players in the [[2007–08 Malaysia Super League]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bt.com.bn/local_sport/2007/10/17/dpmm_fc_players_return_to_serious_training_for_msl|title=DPMM FC players return to serious training for MSL|publisher=[[The Brunei Times]]|date=17 October 2007|deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150415185547/http://www.bt.com.bn/local_sport/2007/10/17/dpmm_fc_players_return_to_serious_training_for_msl|archivedate=15 April 2015|accessdate=5 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Rosmini joined newly formed [[AM Gunners]] in the 2008 Brunei Premier Two and became league champions, gaining promotion to the top flight.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bt.com.bn/local_sport/2008/04/21/gunners_ranger_through|title=Gunners, Ranger through|publisher=The Brunei Times|date=21 April 2008|deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160307210605/http://www.bt.com.bn/local_sport/2008/04/21/gunners_ranger_through|archivedate=7 March 2016|accessdate=5 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; AM Gunners left the Bruneian football league system in 2011 after two seasons. Rosmini next moved to and captained a reformed [[Majlis Sukan Polis Diraja Brunei|MS PDB]], returning to his first club in some ways.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Fitness key to MS ABDB's victory against MS PDB |url=http://msabdbft.blogspot.com/2012/12/fitness-key-to-ms-abdbs-victory-against.html|date=15 December 2012|publisher=The Brunei Times|accessdate=5 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; After a two-season hiatus, he re-appeared for the Policemen in the [[2017 Brunei Super League|2017 season]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Kasuka FC sekadar seri dengan MS PDB |url=http://www.pelitabrunei.gov.bn/Lists/Berita/NewDisplayForm.aspx?ID=11336&amp;ContentTypeId=0x0100BC31BF6D2ED1E4459ACCF88DA3E23BA8|date=8 July 2017|publisher=Pelita Brunei|accessdate=7 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==International career==
Rosmini made his international debut for [[Brunei national football team|Brunei]] at the [[2002 FIFA World Cup qualification (AFC)|2002 World Cup qualifying round for Asia]] in a 0-5 loss against [[Yemen national football team|Yemen]], coming on to replace fellow policeman [[Jasriman Johari]] on 7 April 2001.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.fifa.com/worldcup/archive/edition=4395/preliminaries/preliminary=3847/matches/match=20922/report.html|title=2002 FIFA World Cup Korea/Japan ™ Preliminaries Brunei Darussalam - Yemen |publisher=FIFA.com|date=|deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130224041617/http://www.fifa.com/worldcup/archive/edition=4395/preliminaries/preliminary=3847/matches/match=20922/report.html|archivedate=24 February 2013|accessdate=5 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; He started the rest of the qualifying matches as Brunei completed six games without scoring a goal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Brunei's World Cup campaign ends in five-goal rout in India|url=http://www.e-borneo.com/cgi-bin/np/viewnews.cgi?category=2&amp;id=990419321|date=21 May 2001|publisher=Borneo Bulletin|accessdate=5 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Brunei subsequently refused to take part in World Cup qualifying until the [[2018 FIFA World Cup|2018]] tournament.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Brunei to compete in World Cup qualifiers|url=http://www.nfabd.org/news/2015020301.htm|date=3 February 2015|publisher=The Brunei Times|accessdate=5 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Stan Calvert Cup''', formally known as the '''Stan Calvert Memorial Cup''', was an annual varsity contest that takes place in [[Newcastle upon Tyne]] between the universities of [[Newcastle University|Newcastle]] and [[Northumbria University|Northumbria]] formerly in December and February, before moving to March. The annual cup ran from 1994 to 2018, before being officially cancelled at the start of the 2018 academic year when Newcastle made the decision to withdraw from the competition&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://northumbriasport.com/news/an-update-on-the-stan-calvert-memorial-cup|title=Northumbria Sport : News : An update on the Stan Calvert memorial cup|website=northumbriasport.com|language=en-GB|access-date=2018-10-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; .&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Parsons |first1=Harry |title=Breaking news: Stan Calvert cancelled |url=http://thecourieronline.co.uk/stan-calvert-cancelled/ |website=The Courier |publisher=The Courier |accessdate=10 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== The competition ==
It is named for Stan Calvert, a man from nearby [[Alnwick]], who became involved with sport at the University of Newcastle in the early 1960s and was the university's first Director of Sport&lt;ref&gt;https://www.ncl.ac.uk/nclsport/events/calvert/&lt;/ref&gt; from 1981.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.ncl.ac.uk/nclsport/events/dates/item/stan-calvert-cup-gets-underway&lt;/ref&gt;

The competition does not take place in a single sporting event but rather over 1200 competitors in more than 70 teams compete against each other in 26 different sports, the winning university is determined by whose team won the most events. The competition has taken place every year since its formation in 1994. The current rules that determine the nature of the competition were signed by both universities in 2009.

== Previous winners ==
Since 1994, Newcastle University has won the cup 13 times and Northumbria has won 10 times. There have also been 2 draws. In 2013 Team Newcastle ensured the Stan Calvert Memorial Trophy was retained for an unprecedented 6th consecutive year. For the first time in seven years, Northumbria University reclaimed the trophy from Newcastle University and are the current holders of the cup after a heroic effort to retain the cup for the first time in their history, winning by their biggest margin ever in the process,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://thecourieronline.co.uk/newcastles-stan-calvert-supremacy-smashed/ |title=Newcastle’s Stan Calvert supremacy smashed |publisher=The Courier |date=20 March 2014 |accessdate=4 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; before winning the competition again in 2016, 2017 and 2018.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://nusportcentral.com/team-northumbria/stan-calvert-memorial-cup-games#so-what-is-stan-calvert|title=Stan Calvert {{!}} Team Northumbria {{!}} NU Sport Central|website=nusportcentral.com|access-date=2016-05-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://nusportcentral.com/news/hat-trick-of-stan-calvert-wins-tastes-sweet|title=Hat-trick Of Stan Calvert Wins Tastes Sweet {{!}} News {{!}} NU Sport Central|website=nusportcentral.com|access-date=2016-05-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Suffolk Meadows''' was a [[American Quarter Horse|quarter horse]] racing facility on [[Long Island]] that operated during 1977 and 1986. The racetrack was situated on a {{convert|65|acres|km2|sing=on}} parcel located in [[Yaphank, New York|Yaphank]] northwest of the [[County Route 46 (Suffolk County, New York)|William Floyd Parkway]] interchange on the [[Interstate 495 (New York)|Long Island Expressway]].

The racetrack first opened in 1977 as '''Parr Meadows''' and closed following a 113-day meet after the bank defaulted on loans. Although the track was not built by developer Ron Parr, the Parr Organization assumed ownership after the original builder ran out of funds.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=1949: Parr Brothers Join in Building Suburbia |url=http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_qn4189/is_20040109/ai_n16160361/ |newspaper=Long Island Business News |date=January 9, 2004 |accessdate=2010-02-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="libiznews-2009-05-15"&gt;{{cite news |title=I Came Upon a Child of God, He Was Walking the LIE |first=John |last=Kominicki |url=http://libn.com/blog/2009/05/15/kominicki-i-came-upon-a-child-of-god-he-was-walking-the-lie/ |newspaper=Long Island Business News |date=May 15, 2009 |accessdate=2010-02-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="newsday-2009-08-06"&gt;{{cite news |title=Remembering the 1979 Yaphank concert at Parr Meadows |first=Bill |last=Bleyer |url=http://www.exploreli.com/going-out/music/remembering-the-1979-yaphank-concert-at-parr-meadows-1.1350964 |newspaper=Newsday |date=August 6, 2009 |accessdate=2010-02-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; In May 1986, horse racing briefly returned to Suffolk Meadows for an 86-day stint. The racetrack ceased operations on October 18, 1986.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.racing.ny.gov/AnnualReports/annualreport1986.pdf |title=N.Y.

On September 7, 1979, 18,000 attendees gathered at Parr Meadows for a ten-hour concert featuring a number of the original performers from the [[Woodstock Festival]]. Musical artists attending the tenth year reunion concert included [[Blondie Chaplin]], [[Canned Heat]], [[Country Joe McDonald]], [[John Sebastian]], [[Leslie West]], [[Jorma Kaukonen]], [[Johnny Winter]], [[Paul Butterfield]], [[Rick Danko]] and [[Stephen Stills]]. Many of the concertgoers arrived the day before, parking along William Floyd Parkway and camping out in the woods.&lt;ref name="libiznews-2009-05-15"/&gt;&lt;ref name="newsday-2009-08-06"/&gt;

Suffolk Meadows has also been the site of competitions for the International Professional Rodeo Association and the Suffolk County Fair.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=The Guide |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1988/08/28/nyregion/the-guide-187488.html |newspaper=The New York Times |date=August 28, 1988 |accessdate=2010-02-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Long Island Guide |first=Barbara |last=Delatiner |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1998/05/10/nyregion/long-island-guide.html |newspaper=The New York Times |date=May 10, 1998 |accessdate=2010-02-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; The former racetrack site has also been discussed as a potential location of a casino for the [[Shinnecock Indian Nation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Shinnecock Resurgence |first=Dan |last=Rattiner |authorlink=Dan Rattiner |url=http://www.danshamptons.com/content/danspapers/issue06_2009/05.html |newspaper=Dan's Papers |date=May 1, 2009-05 |accessdate=2010-02-12 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101121010144/http://danshamptons.com/content/danspapers/issue06_2009/05.html |archivedate=November 21, 2010 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1997, developer [[Wilbur Breslin]] planned to develop the adjacent property into a regional shopping mall called Brookhaven Town Center.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Plans for Yaphank Mall Put Builder Under Fire |first=John |last=Rather |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1997/07/27/nyregion/plans-for-yaphank-mall-put-builder-under-fire.html |newspaper=The New York Times |date=July 27, 1997 |accessdate=2010-02-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Sumo Suit Athletics''' is an international sport which started in the United Kingdom in the year 2008. It is a sport where participants wear sumo fat suits while doing regular athletic events.&lt;ref name="ITNNEWS2009"&gt;ITN NEWS [http://www.itnsource.com/jp/shotlist//HUTC/2009/07/25/X25070901/ "QUIRKY: Sumo Suit Athletics World Championships"] ,Retrieved 2010-06-30&lt;/ref&gt;
The suits used weigh around 11&amp;nbsp;kg. The suits restrict leg movement, and participants are not allowed to use their hands to lift the suits up. This results in participants raising their arms and shoulders while running producing a comedic effect.

==World championships==
There have now been three World Championship events held since 2008 with the next event set to take place some time in 2012.

The five main events at the World Championships include:
100m sprint, Long jump, High jump, Shot put and the 400m endurance race. &lt;ref name="ITNNEWS2009" /&gt;

The 2009 men's event, held at the Battersea athletics track in London, was dominated by three South Africans, Willem Muller, Jeremy Gallop and brother Michael Gallop,  who won in all 5 events.&lt;ref name="2009 Weekend Post News Article"&gt;Butler, Lee-Ann [http://www.weekendpost.co.za/article.aspx?id=457426 "Ex-PE man calls shots at oddball sports"] ,''[[The Weekend Post]]'', Port Elizabeth, South Africa, 14 August 2009. Retrieved 2010-06-30&lt;/ref&gt;  Four world records were broken with only the 100m record standing from the previous year. In the women's event Charlotte Willis from Great Britton won 3 events, and four new world records were set in part due to the introduction of 'child's' suits for the women instead of adult suits. The women's High Jump record from 2008 was not beaten.

The 2010 event was again held at the Battersea athletics track in London. In the men's event all but the Shot Put world record was broken. Ed Moyse set a new 100m record with 14.43secs and also a Long Jump record of 4.25m. Jeremy Gallop bettered his own record from 2009 in the High Jump by jumping 1.31m. Sam Hyatt-Twynam ran a blistering pace in the 400m to set a new world record of 1.26secs.
In the women's event Jo Higgins dominated by setting four new world records in the 100m, Long Jump, Shot Put and 400m. Gabrielle Morales from Hungary set a new women's high jump record with a height of 1.05m.

'''Umbro''' is an [[England|English]] [[Sportswear (activewear)|sportswear]] and [[association football|football]] equipment supplier based in [[Cheadle, Greater Manchester|Cheadle]], next to [[Manchester]], [[England]]. Umbro designs, sources, and markets football-related apparel, footwear, and equipment. Its products are sold in over 90 countries worldwide. Since 2012, the company has been a subsidiary of American company [[Iconix Brand Group]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.iconixbrand.com/umbro_history.html Umbro at Iconix Brand website] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130210041507/http://www.iconixbrand.com/umbro_history.html |date=10 February 2013 }}, retrieved 11 February 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
===Beginning and expansion===
The company was founded by Harold Humphreys, along with his brother Wallace in a small workshop in [[Wilmslow]], [[Cheshire]], inspired by the growing interest in [[association football|football]] witnessed nationwide. The name "Umbro" is a quasi-[[portmanteau]] inspired by Humphreys Brothers Clothing. Umbro's kit debut was in the 1934 [[FA Cup]] final, when both teams [[Manchester City]] and [[Portsmouth F.C.|Portsmouth]] wore kits designed and manufactured by the company. Other teams supplied by Umbro during the 1930s and 1940s were [[Sheffield United F.C.|Sheffield United]], [[Preston North End W.F.C.|Preston North End]], [[Manchester United F.C.|Manchester United]] and [[Blackpool F.C.|Blackpool]].

Umbro was the official sports manufacturer of the English [[FA Cup]] and official sponsor of [[The Football Association|The FA]], being the exclusive supplier of [[football (ball)|balls]] to the body's leagues.

In 1952, the British team at the [[Summer Olympics]] wore Umbro kits, tailored for the needs of their individual sports. Umbro would supply kits for the British Olympics team for the next 20 years.

In 1957, Umbro entered the [[tennis]] market, producing sports clothing in collaboration with player [[Ted Tinling]]. This collaboration extended for three decades. Another sportsman who collaborated with Umbro was [[Manchester United]] manager [[Matt Busby]], in 1959. That same year the company started to sell its junior boys' kits, a set of shirt, shorts and socks that would allow young players to wear the same look as their footballing idols.

[[Brazil national football team|Brazil]] became the first [[FIFA World Cup]] champion to wear kits by Umbro in [[1958 World Cup|1958]]. Two years later, Manchester United [[Scotland|Scottish]] player [[Denis Law]] signed an exclusive agreement with the brand, becoming the first footballer to be sponsored by Umbro. The [[England national football team|England national team]] won its only title in [[1966 World Cup|1966]] wearing kits by Umbro (the deal had been signed in 1954). Of the 16 teams that competed, 15 wore kit manufactured by Umbro,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.umbro.com/en-gb/about-umbro/ Umbro history website], retrieved 27 March 2013&lt;/ref&gt; the only exception being the [[Soviet Union national football team|USSR]]. At the same time, 85% of British football teams wore kits by the company, including [[Glasgow Celtic|Celtic]], the first British team to win a [[European Cup]] in 1967.  Liverpool FC won the first four of their five European Cups while wearing Umbro kits, in 1977, 1978, 1981 and 1984.

In 1974, Umbro's founder, Harold Humphreys, died. His sons John and Stuart took over the running of the company. The [[England national football team|England national team]] wore Umbro shirts by choice until 1974, when [[The Football Association]], encouraged by the England manager [[Don Revie]], sold the jersey manufacturing rights to [[Admiral Sportswear]].

After more than a decade wearing Admiral kits, the England national team signed with Umbro again in 1984. In 1986, Umbro began to manufacture its own [[football boot]]s. The company added footballers [[Alan Shearer]] and [[Michael Owen]] (who was only 14 years old) to its list of sponsored athletes. In 1994, Brazil won its fourth FIFA World Cup title in the [[1994 FIFA World Cup|United States]] and club teams [[AFC Ajax]] (in 1995), and Manchester United (in 1999) obtained the [[UEFA Champions League]] and the [[Intercontinental Cup (football)|Intercontinental Cup]], in [[National Stadium Tokyo|Tokyo]], all of them wearing Umbro kits.

In the United States, Umbro was the majority owner (94%) of [[United Soccer Leagues]], the parent organization for North America's lower division men's soccer (tiers two through four in the American Soccer Pyramid), and the second tier women's league (W-League) and youth league (Super Y-League).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.uslsoccer.com/home/124750.html |title= Umbro increases share of USL ownership |publisher=USL Soccer |date=16 March 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the 2009 USL First Division season, the [[Carolina RailHawks]], [[Charleston Battery]], [[Vancouver Whitecaps (1986–2010)|Vancouver Whitecaps]], [[Rochester Rhinos]], [[Austin Aztex]], and [[Puerto Rico Islanders]] all wore Umbro kits. During the 2012 USLPro season, the [[Dayton Dutch Lions]] wore Umbro.

In October 2007, [[JJB Sports]] bought a 10.1% stake in Umbro in a move to protect its stake in the market for England football shirts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/business/7053403.stm |title= JJB Sports acquires 10% in Umbro |publisher=BBC News |date=19 October 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Nike agreement===
On 23 October 2007, it was announced Umbro had agreed to be bought by [[Nike, Inc.|Nike]] in a deal worth {{GBP|285 million}}, the equivalent of 193p per share. The Umbro board recommended to its shareholders they vote in favour of the approach, as it offered a very competitive price for the business. Umbro's share price at the time of the offer was close to 130p.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/business/7057577.stm | work=BBC News | title=Nike to buy Umbro in £285m deal | date=23 October 2007 | accessdate=26 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The deal was approved by regulators in December 2007 and concluded in February 2008.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bizjournals.com/portland/stories/2007/10/22/daily13.html "Nike to buy Umbro" at Portland Business Journal], 23 October 2007&lt;/ref&gt; With the objective of revitalising the brand, Umbro launched the "Tailored by England" lines. As of 4 June 2009, Umbro signed a deal with [[Manchester City F.C.|Manchester City]] to supply kits for the team. Wearing Umbro kits, Manchester City won its first championship in 34 years.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.umbro.com/en-gb/about-umbro/ "About us" - Umbro website]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2010, Umbro became sponsor of reformed American team [[New York Cosmos (2010)|New York Cosmos]] to be its exclusive kit supplier.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sportspromedia.com/news/umbro_sign_deal_with_new_york_cosmos/ "Umbro sign deal with New York Cosmos", SportsPro], 1 October 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

In May 2012, Nike reported that they would be selling Umbro (along with [[Cole Haan]]) in order to focus on their sports brands, including Nike, [[Converse (shoe company)|Converse]], [[Hurley International|Hurley]] and [[Air Jordan]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.highsnobiety.com/news/2012/05/31/nike-sells-cole-haan-and-umbro/ "Nike selles Cole Haan and Umbro"], HighSnobiety website, 2012-05-31&lt;/ref&gt; In September 2012, The FA announced that future England kits would be manufactured by Nike.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/football/2012/sep/03/england-nike-kit-umbro |title=England to wear Nike kits for first time after ending Umbro link |publisher=The Guardian |date=3 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/football/article-2194408/Nike-replace-Umbro-England-kits.html "England to be kitted in Nike as American giants agree deal to replace Umbro", MailOnline], 27 August 2012&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.goal.com/en-gb/news/3270/england-national-team/2012/09/03/3350836/england-announce-five-year-kit-deal-with-nike "England announce five-year kit deal with Nike", Goal.com], 3 September 2012&lt;/ref&gt;

===Iconix Brand Group===
On October 2012, Nike announced that it had agreed with [[Iconix Brand Group]] to sell Umbro for [[United States dollar|US$]]225 million.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.bloomberg.com/news/2012-10-24/iconix-brand-buys-nike-s-umbro-soccer-unit-for-225-million-1-.html "Iconix Brand Buys Nike’s Umbro Soccer Unit for $225 Million" at Bloomberg.com], 24 October 2012&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Forbes12&gt;{{cite web

In February 2014, it was announced that Umbro would supply [[Everton F.C.|Everton]] from the start of the 2014–15 football season.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.evertonfc.com/news/archive/2014/02/04/boss-unveils-new-umbro-partnership/ "Boss Unveils New Umbro Partnership", Everton FC], 4 February 2014&lt;/ref&gt; This was the first new club announcement since [[Iconix Brand Group]] bought Umbro, and was followed by the announcement of similar deals with [[Hull City A.F.C.|Hull City]] and French clubs [[RC Lens|Lens]] and [[FC Nantes|Nantes]]. On 9 June 2014, [[Derby County F.C.|Derby County]] announced that their kits for the 2014–15 season would be made by Umbro.

Later in 2014, Umbro announced deals to supply a number of teams, including the [[Serbian national football team]], the [[Malawi national football team]], [[CR Vasco da Gama|Vasco da Gama]] and [[Grêmio Foot-Ball Porto Alegrense|Grêmio]].

In February 2015, Dutch [[Eredivisie]] champions [[PSV Eindhoven|PSV]] announced a new kit deal with Umbro, replacing PSV's previous deal with Nike, which had been in existence since 1994. The deal coincided with PSV's return to the [[UEFA Champions League]] after a six-year absence.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.footyheadlines.com/2015/02/psv-eindhoven-announce-five-year-umbro-kit-deal.html PSV Eindhoven Announce Five-Year Umbro Kit Deal], 17 February 2015&lt;/ref&gt;

In late April 2015, [[West Ham United F.C.|West Ham United]] announced a new five-year agreement with Umbro as the club's official technical partner. This agreement included creating a commemorative kit for the Hammers' final year in the historic [[Boleyn Ground]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.whufc.com/News/Articles/2015/April/30-April/West-Ham-re-united-with-Umbro/ "West Ham re-united with Umbro", West Ham United FC], 30 April 2015&lt;/ref&gt;

In early December 2015, German club [[1. FC Nürnberg]] announced a long-term kit deal with Umbro as the club's official kit supplier, replacing [[Adidas]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.footyheadlines.com/2015/12/umbro-and-1-fc-nurnberg-sign-long-term-kit-deal.html Umbro and 1. FC Nürnberg Sign Long-Term Kit Deal], 3 December 2015&lt;/ref&gt;

In May 2016, it was announced that Umbro had become the technical sponsor of [[Blackburn Rovers F.C.|Blackburn Rovers]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Rovers return to Umbro|url=http://www.rovers.co.uk/news/article/blackburn-rovers-umbro-3108853.aspx|website=Blackburn Rovers official website|accessdate=2 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; in a five-year deal. And would also return to making [[A.F.C. Bournemouth]] kit after two separate occasions in the 70’s and 80’s for the 2017-18 season.

In June 2017, seven-times German Champion FC Schalke 04 announced a five-year deal with Umbro replacing Adidas after 55 years.

Umbro currently focuses on [[Association football|football]] equipment, such as [[Kit (association football)|kit uniforms (jerseys, shorts and socks)]], [[Kit (association football)#Other equipment|goalkeeper gloves]], [[Ball (association football)|balls]] and [[Football boots|boots]], apart of manufacturing other [[clothing|apparel]] such as [[t-shirt]]s and jackets.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.umbro.com/en-gb/shop/ Umbro products] on Umbro official website, retrieved 12 Feb 2017&lt;/ref&gt;

Until the mid-1980s, the company manufactured only sports clothing, in particular football jerseys, shorts and socks, but had no footwear range. Eventually, in 1985, Umbro decided to introduce its first football boot into the Brazilian market. This design, cheaper than the products of existing boot brands such as [[Adidas]], proved popular and went into mass production internationally two years later.

Umbro also manufactured a popular style of [[shorts]] that reached its peak in the United States in the late 1980s and early 1990s. They were made of [[nylon]], had a drawstring waistband, and often came in bright colours. With the growth of youth soccer leagues in the U.S. in the 1980s, many youths, teens and young adults began wearing them as everyday clothing. At the height of the "Umbro fashion," other brands of soccer shorts, such as Adidas, [[Diadora]], [[Hummel International|Hummel]], [[Lotto Sport Italia|Lotto]] and [[Mitre Sports International|Mitre]], also became popular. Its major competitors in this market include Reebok, Nike, Adidas, [[Puma AG|Puma]] and fellow italian manufacturer  [[Lotto Sport Italia|Lotto]].

Other releases by Umbro include the Stealth boot,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Umbro Stealth Booth|url=http://www.soccercleats101.com/2010/04/12/umbro-stealth-pro-review/|publisher=SoccerCleats101.com|accessdate=12 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; released in 2010 and worn by players such as [[Gaël Clichy]] and [[Phil Jagielka]]. The same year, the company released the GT, worn by then-[[Fulham F.C.|Fulham]] striker [[Darren Bent]]. The company announced it as "its lightest ever boot." This was succeeded by the GT II model.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.soccerbible.com/news/football-boots/archive/2012/09/27/umbro-gt-ii-pro-football-boots-green-carbon-white.aspx Umbro GT II at FootballBible.com]&lt;/ref&gt; June 2011 saw the release of the Umbro Geometra Pro.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Umbro Geometra|url=http://www.footy-boots.com/umbro-geometra-pro/|publisher=Footy-Boots.com|accessdate=17 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2013, Umbro introduced to a new wave of releases that included the Speciali IV and the Geometra II.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Umbro Geometra II|url=http://www.soccercleats101.com/2013/04/29/umbro-geometra-pro-ii-review/|publisher=SoccerCleats101.com|accessdate=4 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Following the purchase of the brand by [[Iconix Brand Group]] in 2013, the first major product release from Umbro was the UX-1,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Umbro UX-1 II|url=http://www.soccerbible.com/performance/football-boots/2014/11/umbro-launch-ux-1-concept/|publisher=Soccerbible.com|accessdate=7 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; a technologically advanced football boot which was voted as one of the best new releases of the year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Umbro UX-1 II|url=http://www.soccerpro.com/theinstep/umbro-ux-1-review/|publisher=Soccerpro.com|accessdate=7 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Vicente Calderón Stadium''' ({{lang-es|Estadio Vicente Calderón}} {{IPA-es|esˈtaðjo βiˈθente kaldeˈɾon|}}) was the home stadium of [[Atlético Madrid]] since its completion in 1966 to 2017, with a current seating capacity of 54,907 and located on the banks of the [[Manzanares River|Manzanares]], in the [[Arganzuela]] district of [[Madrid]], Spain. The stadium was originally called the ''Estadio Manzanares'', but this was later changed to the Vicente Calderón Stadium, in honour of their long-term President [[Vicente Calderón]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://en.clubatleticodemadrid.com/atm/instalations|title=Vicente Calderón Stadium|publisher=AtléticodeMadrid|accessdate=30 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
[[File:Vicente-Calderon-030612-1.jpg|thumb|right|North external view of the stadium.]]
[[File:Estadio Vicente Calderón, 2014.JPG|thumb|right|South external view of the stadium.]]
[[File:Vicente-Calderon-1-070910.jpg|thumb|right|Northwest internal view of the stadium.]]
[[File:Estadio Vicente Calderón - 02.jpg|thumb|right|South end stand view of the stadium.]]

To finance the new stadium, Atlético Madrid had to make a debt issue in 1958 in the form of mortgage bonds that were underwritten mostly by club shareholders and members. {{citation needed|date=March 2015}} On 17 March 1961, Javier Barroso bought land for the construction of a new stadium, to replace the [[Estadio Metropolitano de Madrid]]. In the same year, work began on the new stadium. {{citation needed|date=March 2015}} The ground opened in 1966, and was named the Estadio del Manzanares until 1972.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://int.soccerway.com/teams/spain/club-atletico-de-madrid/2020/venue/|title=Estadio Vicente Calderón|work=Soccerway|publisher=Perform|accessdate=30 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A notable and rather spectacular feature of the Vicente Calderón is that the [[Autopista de Circunvalación M-30|M-30]] dual carriageway, running from the South Node Toledo Bridge, passes below one of the main stands.

===Departure of Atlético ===
On 30 July 2007, Atlético Madrid, [[Mahou-San Miguel Group|Mahou]] brewery and Ayuntamiento de Madrid signed an agreement to reclassify the land that is currently occupied by the Vicente Calderón stadium and the Mahou brewery, agreeing that Atlético would move within three years to the Estadio Olímpico de Madrid, better known as [[Wanda Metropolitano|Estadio La Peineta]] (officially  [[Wanda Metropolitano]]), which was to be renovated in preparation for Atlético's tenancy. After reconstruction, La Peineta holds 67,000 spectators and features fully covered stands. The Vicente Calderón Stadium is soon to be demolished, and a park will be built in its place, which is to be named the 'Park Atlético Madrid'. Atlético then moved to La Peineta in the [[2017-18 La Liga|2017-18 season]].

The decision to demolish the stadium was not well received by some of the Atlético fans who were against the relocation of the club, as they considered it to be a bad move if money was not being used to improve the club itself. The protests were led by the Save the Calderon Group and the Atlético Supporters Club: Asociación Señales de Humo.{{citation needed|date=April 2015}}

==Access==
The Estadio Vicente Calderón is located on the banks of the [[Manzanares (river)|Manzanares]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.timeout.com/madrid/sport-and-fitness/estadio-vicente-calderon|title=Estadio Vicente Calderón|date=10 April 2014|publisher=Time Out|accessdate=21 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition, the stadium can be accessed via the [[Madrid Metro]]. The closest stations are: Pirámides Station and Marqués de Vadillo Station, both of which are on Line 5 of the [[Madrid Metro]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.terra.es/deportes/articulo/html/dpo67455.htm terra.es&lt;/ref&gt;

==Copa del Rey finals==
The stadium hosted the final of the [[Copa del Rey]] (also previously known as the ''Copa del Generalísimo'') on 14 occasions:&lt;br&gt;
[[1973 Copa del Generalísimo Final|1973]] * [[1974 Copa del Generalísimo Final|1974]] * [[1975 Copa del Generalísimo Final|1975]] * [[1977 Copa del Rey Final|1977]] * [[1979 Copa del Rey Final|1979]] * [[1981 Copa del Rey Final|1981]] * [[1986 Copa del Rey Final|1986]] * [[1989 Copa del Rey Final|1989]] * [[1994 Copa del Rey Final|1994]] * [[2005 Copa del Rey Final|2005]] * [[2008 Copa del Rey Final|2008]] * [[2012 Copa del Rey Final|2012]] * [[2016 Copa del Rey Final|2016]] * [[2017 Copa del Rey Final|2017]].
