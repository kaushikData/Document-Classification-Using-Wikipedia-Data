'''Askals''' or '''aspins''' are [[mongrel]] dogs in the [[Philippines]].

==Names==
The name "''askal''" is a [[Tagalog language|Tagalog]]-derived [[portmanteau]] of ''asong kalye'' or "[[street dog]]" as these dogs are commonly seen wandering the streets. The [[Philippine Animal Welfare Society]] (PAWS) has suggested the alternative term ''aspin'', short for ''asong Pinoy'' ([[Pinoy]] dog) probably to avoid the stigma associated with the term "''askal''".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Alya |last=Honasan |title=‘Hey, pare, let’s save the whales’  |url=http://services.inquirer.net/print/print.php?article_id=78027 |publisher=[[Philippine Daily Inquirer]] |date=2007-07-22 |accessdate=2007-10-25 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20090215173312/http://services.inquirer.net/print/print.php?article_id=78027 |archivedate = February 15, 2009|deadurl=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;   In [[Cebuano language|Cebuano]], mongrel dogs are called '''irong Bisaya''', which literally means "[[Visaya]]n dog" or "native dog" (note that the word "Bisaya" doesn't explicitly mean "Visayan" but it is a term pertaining people and animals native to a specific locale. For example, "''manok bisaya''" simply means a breed of chicken native to a locality), implying that these are not thought of as a mixed-breed dog so much as unbred mongrels with no purebred ancestors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gmanews.tv/story/47835/Irong-bisaya-magamit-sa-bomb-sniffing|title=Irong ‘bisaya’ magamit sa bomb sniffing|publisher=[[GMA Network|GMA News.TV]]|accessdate=2007-10-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This is only from a Bisayan point of view since Irong Bisaya don't differ in character or physical appearance from the other Askals found in the entire Philippine archipelago. Physically, the dogs have "all shapes, configurations and sizes."&lt;ref name="ABH"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://lifestyle.inquirer.net/48067/in-praise-of-the-%E2%80%98asong-pinoy%E2%80%99|title=In praise of the ‘asong Pinoy’|last=Alya B. Honasan|date=May 15, 2012|work=[[Philippine Daily Inquirer]]|accessdate=10 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Appearance==
Females' height usually ranges from 12-16 inches while Males can be between 14-19 inches. The coat can be short haired or rough. Coat colors ranges from Black, Brown, Brindle, Gray, Cream and White. Spots are commonly found at the base of the tail and at the back in semi circular fashion. The snout sometimes appears black if the coat color is brown. The tail is usually held high and the ears can be floppy, semi-floppy or fully pointing upwards. The bone structure of a native Askal is on the medium range, never heavy like in Rottweilers.

In an opinion piece for the Inquirer, Michael Tan writes that Askals are often more resilient and street-smart than purebreds.&lt;ref name="tan"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://opinion.inquirer.net/inquireropinion/columns/view_article.php?article_id=62750 |title=Askal |first=Michael |last=Tan |publisher=[[Philippine Daily Inquirer]] |accessdate=2007-04-27 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090215173540/http://opinion.inquirer.net/inquireropinion/columns/view_article.php?article_id=62750 |archivedate=February 15, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{unreliable source?|date=June 2015}}PAWS reports that at one point, 98% of the calls it received about cruelty and abuse involved askals.&lt;ref name="ABH"/&gt;

==Interactions with humans==
Askals have been raised traditionally as guard dogs of the home and farm. They are naturally suspicious of strangers, independent and protective of family members. They are also good to very young children as companions due to their devotion to family members. They are usually trusted by their Filipino owners to roam around town markets or the neighborhood to socialize with other dogs which is why these dogs are seen by the Western people as stray dogs when, in fact, they are not. They are, however, expected to be home before dusk especially the males who would always be looking for females in heat. Female dogs usually stay home and are excellent watch dogs. Aspins were allowed to compete in the First Philippine Dog Agility Championships in 2013.&lt;ref name="JSB"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://newsinfo.inquirer.net/415039/aspin-to-compete-in-national-dog-show |title=Aspin to compete in national dog show |last=Jose Santino S.

'''''Bigelow v. RKO Radio Pictures, Inc.''''', 327 U.S. 251 (1946), was a decision by the [[United States Supreme Court]] allowing an action to recover [[Compensatory damages#Compensatory damages|compensatory damages]] under the antitrust statutes.  The jury had returned a verdict for $120,000 in petitioner's favor, covering a five-year period where plaintiff suffered due to respondents' antitrust conspiracy.  The trial court, sitting in the [[United States District Court for the Northern District of Illinois|Northern District of Illinois]], gave judgment for treble damages, as prescribed by § 4 of the [[Clayton Antitrust Act|Clayton Act]].  The [[United States Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit|7th Circuit]] reversed on the sole ground that the evidence of damage was not sufficient for submission to the jury, and directed the entry of judgment for respondents ''non obstante veredicto'' (notwithstanding the verdict).&lt;ref&gt;150 F.2d 877 (7th Cir. 1945)&lt;/ref&gt;  The Supreme Court granted [[certiorari]] to determine whether the evidence of damage was sufficient to support the verdict.  Respondents argued that any measure of damages would be too speculative and uncertain to afford an accurate measure of the amount of the damage.&lt;ref&gt;327 U.S. 251, 263&lt;/ref&gt;  The Supreme Court disagreed, not wanting to let the respondent defeat a remedy because its antitrust violation was so effective and complete.  The Court held that the jury could return a verdict for the plaintiffs, even though damages could not be measured with the exactness which would otherwise have been possible, so long as the jury made a "just and reasonable estimate of the damage based on relevant data".&lt;ref&gt;''Id''. at 264&lt;/ref&gt;  The judgment of the district court was affirmed and the judgment of the court of appeals was reversed.

==Facts==
Petitioners, owners of the Jackson Park motion picture theatre in Chicago, alleged that respondents, some of whom, like [[RKO Pictures]], were distributors of films, and some of whom owned or controlled theatres in [[Chicago]], entered into a [[Sherman Antitrust Act#Inference of conspiracy|conspiracy]] which continued from some time before November 1936 to the date the suit was brought, July 28, 1942.  During the conspiracy, films were distributed among cinemas in Chicago in such a manner that theatres owned by some of the conspirators were able to show movies before independent theater operators.  Independent exhibitors were not able to show new movies until the conspirators had finished with a "[[First run films|first run]]".

The first question was whether there was an unlawful conspiracy, and the second question was how to measure the damages for any loss, given the difficulty of knowing how many people might have attended different films.

==Judgment==
The Supreme Court found that it was "indisputable that the jury could have found that ... a first run theater possessed competitive advantages over later run theaters" and that this discriminatory release was "damaging to petitioners".&lt;ref&gt;''Id''. at 260&lt;/ref&gt; The problem, however, was the uncertainty in determining to what amount those damages should total. The petitioners submitted two methodologies for calculating damages.  The first was the '''yardstick method''', which compared the earnings from petitioner's theater, Jackson Park, during the conspiracy to the earnings of its competitor, the Maryland Theater.  The two theaters were comparable in size, although the Jackson Park theater was "superior in location, equipment, and attractiveness to patrons."&lt;ref&gt;''Id''. at 258&lt;/ref&gt;  The Maryland Theater, however, was owned by [[Paramount Pictures]], and benefited from the conspiracy.  The evidence showed that during the five-year period, Maryland's profit exceeded petitioner's like profit by $115,982.34.

The second measure was the '''before &amp; after method'''.  Here, the Court looked to the years 1933-1937, where the petitioner had successfully showed at least some first run movies, to the five-year period where the conspiracy was established to have happened, and petitioner was completely shut out of first run movies despite its best efforts.  This comparison showed a falling off of petitioners' profits during the five-year period aggregating $125,659.00.

The 7th Circuit concluded that the jury had adopted the before &amp; after method, but that this proof did not furnish a proper measure of damage for the reason that it could not be proved what petitioner's earnings would have been in the absence of the illegal distribution of films.  The Supreme Court reversed, holding that a damage award does not need to be mathematically precise, but it must be a just and reasonable estimate based on the evidence presented, and not based on speculation.  Petitioners are able to submit yardstick or before &amp; after estimates, but they must be careful to use comparable data.

'''Cantonese slang''' is a type of [[slang]] used in areas where [[Cantonese|Cantonese language]] is spoken.

==History==
{{expand section|date=January 2013}}
As ties with Hong Kong and [[Mainland China]] increased, usage of Cantonese slang and adaptations of Cantonese slang into other Chinese dialects increased within the Mainland.&lt;ref&gt;Hsing, p. [https://books.google.com/books?id=py6kE5SeoL8C&amp;pg=PA33&amp;dq=Hong+Kong+Cantonese+Slang&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=wPXlUNDBEYyu8AS2xYDACA&amp;ved=0CEAQ6AEwAg#v=onepage&amp;q=Hong%20Kong%20Cantonese%20Slang&amp;f=false 33].&lt;/ref&gt;

==Usage==
[[Linda Lai Chiu-han|Linda Chiu-han Lai]], author of "Film and Enigmatization," said that it is not possible to translate Cantonese slang, like how slang in other languages cannot be translated.&lt;ref name=Lai242&gt;Lai, p. [https://books.google.com/books?id=Bmihe5fRwV4C&amp;pg=PA242&amp;dq=Hong+Kong+Cantonese+Slang&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=wPXlUNDBEYyu8AS2xYDACA&amp;ved=0CDoQ6AEwAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=Hong%20Kong%20Cantonese%20Slang&amp;f=false 242].&lt;/ref&gt;

Wong Man Tat Parco wrote a thesis on the usage of Cantonese slang by young people in [[Hong Kong]]. He said "[i]n terms of the frequency of slang use, the present research findings suggest that females are by no means passive slang users nowadays. Therefore the traditional belief that males are slang dominators and females slang eschewers... does not hold true at present time any longer."&lt;ref&gt;Adams, p. [https://books.google.com/books?id=UrrCoCUiW3gC&amp;pg=PA85&amp;dq=Hong+Kong+Cantonese+Slang&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=wPXlUNDBEYyu8AS2xYDACA&amp;ved=0CFgQ6AEwBg#v=onepage&amp;q=Hong%20Kong%20Cantonese%20Slang&amp;f=false 85].&lt;/ref&gt;

==Types of slang==
{{expand section|date=January 2013}}
{{see also|Cantonese profanity}}
"[[Triad (organized crime)|Triad]] language" is a type of Cantonese slang. It is censored out of television and films, and triad language. Kingsley Bolton and Christopher Hutton, the authors of "Bad Boys and Bad Language: Chòu háu and the Sociolinguistics of Swear Words in Cantonese," said that regardless of official discouragement of the use of triad language, "[T]riad language or triad-associated language is an important source of innovation in Hong Kong Cantonese."&lt;ref name=BoltonHutton300&gt;Bolton and Hutton, p. [https://books.google.com/books?id=AGivRsg7ZjAC&amp;pg=PA300&amp;dq=Hong+Kong+Cantonese+Slang&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=wPXlUNDBEYyu8AS2xYDACA&amp;ved=0CE0Q6AEwBA#v=onepage&amp;q=Hong%20Kong%20Cantonese%20Slang&amp;f=false 300].&lt;/ref&gt;

''Chòu háu'' (粗口, Jyutping: cou1 hau2, Mandarin Pinyin: ''Cūkǒu'', Lit: Coarse Mouth) refers to sexually explicit taboo words. In Hong Kong print media, feature fils, and television, such words are censored. Bolton and Hutton said "[t]he use of ''chòu háu'' is often seen as a marker of criminality of triad-membership, and official agencies tend to view the spread of ''chòu háu'' into the mainstream of Hong Kong society and its media as indicating a general crisis, as being symptomatic of a rising tide of social disorder and alienation."&lt;ref name=BoltonHutton300/&gt;

Two way of talking in Cantonese slang is "[[Moh lei tau]]." [[Chow Sing Chi]], a comedy actor, started the slang in the 1990s. "Moh lei tau" became popular with younger people and secondary school students, and the groups began to use it. The slang made Chow well-known and financially prosperous. Some prominent members of Hong Kong society believed that the slang was lowering the quality of the language and asked youth to stop using it. Sue Wright, author of ''One Country, Two Systems, Three Languages: A Survey of Changing Language Use in Hong Kong'', said in 1997 that "The rage is over now; the role of television in starting it remains indisputable."&lt;ref&gt;Wright, p. [https://books.google.com/books?id=uys1QNq4t-AC&amp;pg=PA14&amp;dq=Hong+Kong+Cantonese+Slang&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=wPXlUNDBEYyu8AS2xYDACA&amp;ved=0CGoQ6AEwCQ#v=onepage&amp;q=Hong%20Kong%20Cantonese%20Slang&amp;f=false 14].&lt;/ref&gt;

==Attitudes towards slang==
{{expand section|date=January 2013}}
The authorities in [[Hong Kong]] monitor film and television for slang, removing what is considered to be inappropriate. Kingsley Bolton and Christopher Hutton, the authors of "Bad Boys and Bad Language: Chòu háu and the Sociolinguistics of Swear Words in Cantonese," said that Hong Kong authorities have far less tolerance of vulgar words than in western societies such as the [[United Kingdom]] and that aspect is "seems to distinguish the situation" in Hong Kong.&lt;ref name=BoltonHutton300/&gt;

There are a lot of slang terms in Hong Kong, for example there are terms for members of minority groups include "鬼佬[[gweilo]]," (ghost man) refers to [[White people]] (mainly US and UK) because of the eye, hair and skin color differences, "ga tau", "ga jai", and "蘿白頭 lo baat tau" ([[radish]] head) meaning [[Japanese people]], "bak gwei" (white ghost) meaning Caucasians, "黑鬼 hak gwei" (black ghost) refers to [[Black people]] while the "ghost" part is inherited from "鬼佬[[gweilo]]" (ghost man) in a sense meaning foreigners, "bun mui/jai" meaning [[Philippine people|Filipina/Filipino]] domestic employees, and "阿差ah cha" or "阿星 ah sing" meaning [[Indian people]] and [[Pakistani people]].&lt;ref&gt;Lo, p. [https://books.google.com/books?id=I0kvN9LDHP0C&amp;pg=PA69&amp;dq=Hong+Kong+Cantonese+Slang&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=wPXlUNDBEYyu8AS2xYDACA&amp;ved=0CFIQ6AEwBQ#v=onepage&amp;q=Hong%20Kong%20Cantonese%20Slang&amp;f=false 69].&lt;/ref&gt;

==Significance of slang==
[[Linda Chiu-han Lai]], author of "Film and Enigmatization," said that "The power of Cantonese slang is instantaneously differentiating at the moment of utterance: it distinguishes not only Cantonese from [[Standard Chinese|Mandarin]] speakers, but also Cantonese speakers in Hong Kong from those who live in places like [[Singapore]], [[Malaysia]], [[Guangzhou|Canton]], [[Canada]], and so on—part of the [[Cantonese diaspora]]."&lt;ref name=Lai242/&gt;

A '''cat café''' is a theme [[Coffeehouse|café]] whose attraction is [[cat]]s that can be watched and played with.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://dictionary.cambridge.org/dictionary/english/cat-cafe|title=cat café Meaning in the Cambridge English Dictionary|website=dictionary.cambridge.org|language=en|access-date=2018-06-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Etymology ==
''Cat café'' has been officially recognized in the online edition of the [[Oxford Dictionary of English]] since August 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=New words in oxforddictionaries|url=https://www.theguardian.com/science/2015/aug/27/hangry-bants-fatberg-new-words-in-oxforddictionaries|accessdate=28 August 2015}}&lt;br/&gt;{{Cite news|url = https://www.reuters.com/article/2015/08/27/us-life-manspread-idUSKCN0QW1Y620150827|title = Manspreading, hangry, Grexit join Oxford online dictionary|date = 27 August 2015|work = |access-date = |publisher = Reuters}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The world's first cat café, "Cat Flower Garden" (貓花園&lt;ref name="NBP"&gt;[[Nihon Keizai Shimbun|Nikkei BP]] : [http://trendy.nikkeibp.co.jp/article/column/20080422/1009762/ Article on 2 May 2008] {{jp icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;), opened its doors in [[Taipei]], Taiwan, in 1998.&lt;ref name="bbc_20120402"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.com/travel/story/20120402-worldwide-weird-feline-fun-in-japans-cat-cafes|title=BBC - Travel - Feline fun in Japan's cat cafes|first=Lindsey | last=Galloway|publisher=|accessdate=7 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Taiwanese cat café eventually became a tourist destination, attracting tourists from Japan as well as all over the globe.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://mentalfloss.com/article/56592/brief-history-cat-cafe|title=A Brief History of the Cat Café|work=Mental Floss|accessdate=7 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although the origin of cat café is in Taiwan, the concept blossomed in Japan,&lt;ref name="bbc_20120402"/&gt; where the first one named "Neko no Jikan" (lit. "Cat's Time") was opened in [[Osaka]] in 2004.&lt;ref name="NBP"/&gt; Due to the Japan's land size and population, many residents live in small apartments or condominiums which do not allow pets, making a cat café a very popular destination for young workers looking for the companionship and comfort offered. Tokyo's first cat café, named "Neko no mise" (Shop of Cats), opened in 2005. After this, the popularity of cat cafés boomed in Japan. From 2005 to 2010, seventy-nine cat cafés opened across the country.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.vice.com/read/meow-meow-meow-329-v17n2|title=Meow Meow Meow|first=Tomo | last=Kosuga|work=VICE|accessdate=7 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Controversy==
In the United Kingdom animal charities disagree on whether cat cafés are a suitable environment for cats with the [[Royal Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals|RSPCA]], [[Cats Protection]] and the [[Celia Hammond#Celia Hammond Animal Trust|Celia Hammond Animal Trust]] criticizing them for keeping large numbers of cats in a confined space with a revolving population of people. International Cat Care takes a more positive view saying "It is a difficult environment to get right but it's not impossible by any means". However, all the charities agree that cat cafés need to be properly regulated.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Are cat cafes good for cats?|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/magazine-37199653|accessdate=14 September 2016|work=BBC News|date=13 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Cat cafés are quite popular in Japan, with [[Tokyo]] being home to 58 cat cafés {{as of|2015|lc=y}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.yahoo.com/news/tokyo-cat-cafe-shut-down-animal-neglect-063457497.html?ref=gs|title=Tokyo cat cafe shut down for animal neglect|publisher=|accessdate=16 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first was {{nihongo|''Cat's Store''|猫の店|Neko no Mise}}, by Norimasa Hanada, which opened in 2005. The popularity of cat cafés in Japan is attributed to many apartments forbidding pets, and to cats providing relaxing companionship in what may otherwise be a stressful and lonesome urban life. Other forms of [[pet rental]], such as rabbit cafés, are also common in Japan.&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.japantimes.co.jp/text/nn20120216f2.html?fb_ref=article_japantimes Tokyo's rabbit cafes hopping with customers]."

There are various types of cat cafés in Japan. Some feature specific categories of cat such as [[black cat]]s, fat cats, rare [[cat breed|breed]] cats or ex-[[feral cat|stray cat]]s. Every cat café in Japan is required to obtain a license and comply with the strict requirements and regulations of the nation's Animal Treatment and Protection Law.&lt;ref&gt;Iwata, Mamiko, [[About.com|All About]] : [http://allabout.co.jp/pet/cat/closeup/CU20100051A/ Article on 7 March 2010] {{jp icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Japanese cat cafés feature strict rules to ensure cleanliness and animal welfare, in particular seeking to ensure that the cats are not disturbed by excessive and unwanted attention, such as by young children or when sleeping. Many cat cafés also seek to raise awareness of cat welfare issues, such as abandoned and stray cats and many often have cats from local animal shelters to help them lose any fear of humans and advertise them for possible adoption. From 2012 the cats could be displayed until 8&amp;nbsp;pm, but in 2016 the guidelines of the [[Ministry of the Environment (Japan)|environment ministry]] state that they may visit  and play with customers until 10&amp;nbsp;pm.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.news.com.au/lifestyle/real-life/wtf/cats-at-japans-cat-cafes-now-allowed-to-stay-up-till-10pm/news-story/ab6955ba24d2af012438cd4c6b999c4a Cats at Japan's ‘cat cafes’ now allowed to stay up till 10pm 28 April 2016] ''News.com.au'' Retrieved 3 May 2016&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Austria ===

According to local legend, the world's first cat café opened in Vienna in the summer of 1912 and ceased operation approximately two years later. It is said that Vladimir Lenin was a regular for a period in 1913, finding the feline companionship a comfort during his time of exile. The cat café is known to have ceased operation shortly after the beginning of the First World War, although the much repeated story that the closure was due to its patriotic owner's donating all the cats to a factory making fur-lined boots for the war effort may be apocryphal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.pressreader.com/uk/the-oldie/20151209/282218009716840|title=PressReader.com - Connecting People Through News|website=www.pressreader.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2012 cat café Neko was opened in Vienna.

In the United States, most health departments require special steps to separate the cafe area from area where the cats are housed. In some cases, this even extends to areas that cats pass through only briefly (e.g. an adopted cat must leave through a separate door without passing an area that prepares food).&lt;ref name="webcat"&gt;{{cite web|title=What's a Cat Cafe?|url=http://www.catcafesd.com/us/whats-a-cat-cafe/|accessdate=14 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In contrast to Japanese cat cafés, US cafes typically focus on adoptions.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1410">'''''Chuanyue''''' (穿越) is a Chinese genre of fiction where the protagonist travels back in time to historical periods.

The first modern work of the genre is said to be ''[[A Step into the Past]]'' by [[Hong Kong]] writer [[Huang Yi (author)|Huang Yi]]. Famous works that can be categorized as ''chuanyue'' includes many of the works published by Qidian Chinese Network, such as ''[[Illumine Lingao]]''.

A popular sub-genre is "Qingchuan" (清穿), where the often female protagonist travels back to the [[Qing dynasty]] and engages in romance with the sons of [[List of emperors of the Qing Dynasty|Qing Emperors]]. The three novels ''[[Bubu Jingxin]]'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://vip.book.sina.com.cn/book/index_80155.html |title=步步惊心_桐华_言情小说_文化读书频道_新浪网 |publisher=Vip.book.sina.com.cn |date=2011-09-13 |accessdate=2011-09-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Meng Hui Da Qing'', and ''Yao Hua'' are the first three Qingchuan novels. They are also called ''the three hills of Qingchuan novel''. Qingchuan novels are of great popularity among [[Chinese people]], especially the young women. Some of the novels like ''Bu Bu Jingxin'' are so popular that they have already been changed to TV series.  These TV series has won great audience ratings since broadcast.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4339">'''Clandestine literature''', also called "underground literature", refers to a type of editorial and publishing process that involves self-publishing works, often in contradiction with the legal standards of a location. Clandestine literature is often an attempt to circumvent censorship, prosecution, or other suppression. In academic study, such literature may be referred to as heterodox publications (as opposed to officially sanctioned, orthodox publishing).

Examples of clandestine literature include the [[Samizdat]] literature of Soviet dissidents; the [[Aljamiado]] literature of [[Al-Andalus]] Spain;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Baralt|first=Luce López|title=Islam in Spanish Literature: From the Middle Ages to the Present|year=1992|publisher=BRILL|isbn=9789004094604|pages=171–3}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[nushu]] writing of some upper-class women in [[Hunan]], China, from around the 10th century to the 19th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Xing Lu |author2=Wenshan Jia |author3=D. Ray Heisey |title=Chinese Communication Studies: Contexts and Comparisons|year=2002|publisher=Greenwood Publishing Group|isbn=9781567506563|pages=105}}&lt;/ref&gt; Clandestine publications were plentiful during the [[French Enlightenment|Enlightenment]] era in 18th-century France, circulating as pamphlets or manuscripts,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Clandestine E-Texts from the Eighteenth Century|url=http://www.vc.unipmn.it/~mori/e-texts/|publisher=University of Turin-Vercelli|accessdate=October 20, 2012|author=Gianluca Mori}}&lt;/ref&gt; usually containing texts that would have been considered highly blasphemous by the [[Ancien Régime]], or even straight out atheist. These clandestine manuscripts particularly flourished in the 1720s, and contained such controversial works as ''[[Treatise of the Three Impostors]]'' and the reverend [[Jean Meslier]]s ''Atheistic Testament''.&lt;ref&gt;Jonathan I. Israel, Enlightenment Contested'', Oxford University Press, 2006, pp. 722ff.&lt;/ref&gt; Both texts were later published in edited versions by [[Voltaire]], but handwritten manuscript copies have been found in private libraries all over Europe. The clandestine literature of 18th century France also consisted of printed works produced in neighbouring Switzerland or the Netherlands and smuggled into France. These books were usually termed "philosophical works", but varied greatly in content from pornography, utopian novels, political slander and actual philosophical works by radical enlightenment philosophers like [[Baron d'Holbach]], [[Julien Offray de La Mettrie]] and [[Jean-Jacques Rousseau]].&lt;ref&gt;Robert Darnton, The Forbidden Best-Sellers of Pre-Revolutionary France, W.W. Norton &amp; Company, New York, 1996.&lt;/ref&gt;

The willingness to break the law may be due to ideological reasons, when works are contrary to government positions or pose a threat to the institutions in power, but also for reasons at a formal level, when publications do not comply with legal regulations imposed for the circulation of printed works. Underground literature is a type of clandestine literature that does not necessarily have the evasion of the censorship of the time as its purpose; the goal of its writers may only be to lower publishing costs, often being funded by the authors themselves.

Works that are originally published by clandestine means may eventually become established as canonical literature, such as ''[[Das Kapital]]'' and ''[[El Buscón]]''.

A legitimate publisher in one jurisdiction may assist writers from elsewhere to circumvent their own laws by enabling them to publish abroad. The [[Olympia Press]] in Paris published several 20th-century English-language writers, including [[Henry Miller]], who were facing censorship and possible prosecution in their own country at the time.

'''Claremont Graduate University''' ('''CGU''') is a private, all-graduate [[research university]] located in [[Claremont, California]], a city {{convert|35|mi}} east of downtown [[Los Angeles]]. Founded in 1925, CGU is a member of the [[Claremont Colleges]] which includes five undergraduate ([[Pomona College]], [[Claremont McKenna College]], [[Harvey Mudd College]], [[Scripps College]], [[Pitzer College]]) and two graduate (CGU and [[Keck Graduate Institute|Keck Graduate Institute of Applied Life Sciences]]) institutions of higher education. Adjoining and within walking distance of one another,&lt;ref&gt;&lt;span id="map1"&gt;[http://www.cuc.claremont.edu/maps/tccmap.pdf Claremont map (PDF)]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; design was based on that of [[Oxford University]] and [[Cambridge University]].

CGU is the oldest all-graduate institution in the United States, with many notable alumni in different fields all over the world. The university is organized into five separate schools: the School of Arts &amp; Humanities; School of Community &amp; Global Health; Drucker School of Management; School of Educational Studies; and the School of Social Science, Policy, &amp; Evaluation.

== History ==
Founded in 1925, CGU was the second of the Claremont Colleges to form, following [[Pomona College]] and preceding [[Scripps College]]. Claremont Graduate University is the oldest remaining all-graduate university in the United States. The school has undergone several name changes since its inception. After being called Claremont University College for thirty-seven years, in 1962 the school officially became known as Claremont Graduate School and University Center. Five years later, in 1967, the name was again changed to Claremont University Center, and in 1998 it acquired the name Claremont Graduate University.

The Claremont Colleges were designed to incorporate the [[University of Oxford|Oxford]] Model of higher education. Instead of one large university composed of several separate schools, the Claremont Colleges are made up of different institutions designed around differing theories of pedagogy. CGU was founded upon the principle that [[Postgraduate education|graduate education]] is separate and distinct from undergraduate education. Students discover and cultivate their disciplines during undergraduate course work; at CGU students continue cultivation of their own disciplines, but are also expected to augment this with research that incorporates other disciplines as well. This is called "[[Transdisciplinarity]]", and is an essential component of Claremont Graduate University’s functioning theory of [[pedagogy]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.cgu.edu/why-cgu/transdisciplinary-studies/|title=Transdisciplinary Studies|publisher=|accessdate=14 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The school is home to about 2,200 masters and PhD students, as well as approximately 200 full and part-time faculty members. The [[Carnegie Foundation for the Advancement of Teaching]] has classified Claremont Graduate University as a CompDoc/NMedVet: Comprehensive doctoral (no medical/veterinary) with high research activity.&lt;ref&gt;[https://wayback.archive-it.org/all/20140511101546/http://classifications.carnegiefoundation.org//lookup_listings//institution.php Institution Profile] The Carnegie Classification of Institutions of Higher Education&lt;/ref&gt; Its five academic schools and one independent department award master's or/and doctoral degrees in 31 disciplines. Enrollment is limited and classes are small.

==== Drucker School of Management ====
The Peter F. Drucker and Masatoshi Ito School of Management follows the [[Peter Drucker|Drucker]] philosophy based on people (management as a human enterprise, as a liberal art) and looks beyond traditional perceptions of economics, instead espousing management as a liberal art, focusing on social theory, history, and sustainability.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3247">The '''Costa Rican Tourism Board''' ({{lang-es|'''Instituto Costarricense de Turismo'''}}) is the government agency responsible for promoting sustainable [[tourism in Costa Rica]]. Originally the agency was created by decree in 1931 as the National Tourism Board, and by a law approved on August 9 of 1955 the agency became the Instituto Costarricense de Turismo (ICT).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.visitcostarica.com/ict/paginas/TourismBoard.asp|title=History and Legal Framework|publisher=Instituto Costarricense de Turismo|accessdate=2011-10-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Tourism Board is responsible for granting the fiscal incentives available in the country since 1985 for tourism development. These incentives consist mainly of tax exemptions for companies providing hotel services, [[air transport]], [[car rental]], [[gastronomy]] services, [[travel agencies]], and other tourism related services.&lt;ref name=Law6090&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.visitcostarica.com/ict/paginas/leyes/pdf_2011/Estudio_de_Plazo_al_07-06-10.pdf|title=Estudio Plazo de Consolidación de las Empresas Turísticas| author=Dirección de Gestión y Asesoría Jurídica, ICT |publisher=ICT|date=June 2010|accessdate=2011-10-30|language=Spanish}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://wvw.nacion.com/ln_ee/2005/febrero/03/pais13.html|title=Contraloría ampara exoneraciones a empresas turísticas|author=José Enrique Rojas|work=[[La Nacion (Costa Rica)|La Nación]] |date=2005-02-03|accessdate=2011-10-29|language=Spanish}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The agency introduced in 1997 a voluntary [[Certification for Sustainable Tourism Program]] (known as CST) was introduced in order to turn "''the concept of sustainability into something real"'' by ''"improving the way in which the natural and social resources are utilized, to motivate the active participation of the local communities, and to support the competitiveness of the business sector.''&lt;ref name=INCAE&gt;{{cite web | url=http://sd-cite.iisd.org/cgi-bin/koha/opac-detail.pl?biblionumber=46305|format=PDF|title=Impacts on Developing Countries of Changing Production and Consumption Patterns in Developed Countries: The Case of Ecotourism in Costa Rica|publisher=INCAE, available at''International Institute for Sustainable Development'' website|author=Crist Inman|year=1997|accessdate=2008-06-10|language=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The program was aimed for all types of businesses in the tourism industry, but it began only with lodging providers.

The '''Council of International Students Australia''', or CISA, is the peak representative body for [[international students]] in [[Australia]]. CISA was founded on 7 July 2010 in Hobart, Tasmania and provides [[Student unionism in Australia|member associations]] with representation to the [[Government of Australia|Federal government]], and peak bodies such as the [[Australian Research Council]], [[English Australia]], [[ACPET]], [[TAFE Directors Australia]] and [[Universities Australia]], on issues affecting international students in Australia.

Recognising the overlap between undergraduate, postgraduate, domestic and international students, CISA works in collaboration with the [[National Union of Students of Australia|National Union of Students]] and [[Council of Australian Postgraduate Associations]] where matters impact on all students (such as [[voluntary student unionism]] and [[travel concessions]]).

==Purpose==

* Advocate for the interests and needs of international students;
* Advocate for high quality education for international students;
* Facilitate network building among stakeholders with an interest in supporting international students;
* Host an annual national forum for international students;
* Provide a means of consulting and engaging with international students;
* Host future international student roundtable events in partnership with various government entities;
* Promote cross-cultural awareness and interactions in Australia;
* Advocate for non-racist, non-discriminatory law reform concerning international students.

==History==

Following the collapse of the [[National Liaison Committee for International Students in Australia]] in 2008,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Overseas student group at centre of bullying claims |author=Heath Gilmore |date=9 May 2009 |url=http://www.smh.com.au/national/overseas-student-group-at-centre-of-bullying-claims-20090508-axzz.html | journal=The Sydney Morning Herald}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Victorian names dispute for international student bodies |author=Andrew Trounson |date=17 June 2009 |journal=The Australian |url=http://nlc.edu.au/news2009_sub.php?newsID=164 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110301174609/http://nlc.edu.au/news2009_sub.php?newsID=164 |archivedate=1 March 2011 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; international students lacked a legitimate and credible national representative body to advocate on their behalf. In July 2010, 52 student, ethnic and community organisations gathered in Hobart, Tasmania to formally constitute a new peak representative organisation, CISA, at an Inaugural General Meeting (IGM).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=International Students in Australia Announce United Voice |date=12 July 2010 |url=http://www.cisa.edu.au/uploads/CISA_MR_IGM_12_July_2010.pdf |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110301234313/http://www.cisa.edu.au/uploads/CISA_MR_IGM_12_July_2010.pdf |archivedate=1 March 2011 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The IGM was the culmination of two years of discussion among representative bodies and international students.  The process was supported by a working group of international student representatives from across Australia, convened at an international students’ forum hosted in Melbourne in 2009. The 2010 Forum was hosted at the University of Tasmania and coincided with the Education Conference of the National Union of Students.  Around 80 international student representatives attended, from all states and all levels of post-secondary education.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=International Students in Australia Announce United Voice |date=12 July 2010 |url=http://www.cisa.edu.au/uploads/CISA_MR_IGM_12_July_2010.pdf |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110301234313/http://www.cisa.edu.au/uploads/CISA_MR_IGM_12_July_2010.pdf |archivedate=1 March 2011 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Censorshiplolcat.jpg|thumb|right|[[Lolcat]] images are often shared through the same networks used by online activists.|alt=A picture of a striped cat in an apparent seated position with its legs spread, looking at the camera. In the upper left corner is the text "Why U Wanna Censor Me?" in white capital letters]]

The '''cute cat theory of digital activism''' is a [[theory]] concerning [[Internet activism]], [[Web censorship]], and "cute cats" (a term used for any low-value, but popular online activity) developed by [[Ethan Zuckerman]] in 2008.&lt;ref name=fa/&gt;&lt;ref name="nyt"/&gt; It posits that most people are not interested in activism; instead, they want to use the web for mundane activities, including surfing for [[pornography]] and [[lolcat]]s ("cute cats").&lt;ref name=wch/&gt; The tools that they develop for that (such as [[Facebook]], [[Flickr]], [[Blogger (service)|Blogger]], [[Twitter]], and similar platforms) are very useful to [[social movement]] activists, who may lack resources to develop dedicated tools themselves.&lt;ref name=wch/&gt; This, in turn, makes the activists more immune to reprisals by governments than if they were using a dedicated activism platform, because shutting down a popular public platform provokes a larger public outcry than shutting down an obscure one.&lt;ref name=wch/&gt;

==The Internet and censorship==
Zuckerman states that "[[Web 1.0]] was invented to allow physicists to share research papers. [[Web 2.0]] was created to allow people to share pictures of cute cats."&lt;ref name=wch/&gt; Zuckerman says that if a tool passes "cute cat" purposes, and is widely used for low-value purposes, it can be and likely is used for online activism, too.&lt;ref name=wch/&gt;

If the government chooses to shut down such generic tools, it will hurt people's ability to "look at cute cats online", spreading dissent and encouraging the activists' cause.&lt;ref name=nyt/&gt;&lt;ref name="wch"/&gt;

==Chinese model==
According to Zuckerman, [[internet censorship in the People's Republic of China]], which relies on its own, self-censored, Web 2.0 sites, is able to circumvent the cute-cat problem because [[Government of China|the government]] is able to provide people with access to cute-cat content on domestic, [[Self-censorship|self-censored]] sites while blocking access to Western sites, which are less popular in China than in many other places worldwide.&lt;ref name=wch/&gt;&lt;ref name="Cute Cat Theory: The China Corollary"/&gt;

"Sufficiently usable read/write platforms will attract porn and activists. If there's no porn, the tool doesn't work. If there are no activists, it doesn't work well," Zuckerman has stated.&lt;ref name=wch/&gt;

'''Saint Devota''' ({{lang-fr|Sainte Dévote}}; died ca. 303 AD) is the [[patron saint]] of [[Corsica]] and [[Monaco]].  She was killed during the persecutions of [[Diocletian]] and [[Maximian]]. She is sometimes identified with another Corsican saint named [[Julia of Corsica|Julia]], who was described in [[Latin]] as ''Deo devota'' ("devoted to God").  The description was misinterpreted as a [[proper name]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.saintpatrickdc.org/ss/0127.shtml#devo Saint of the Day, January 27] Retrieved 2012-03-02.&lt;/ref&gt;  The legend connected with her is similar to those told of other saints of the region, such as [[Saint Reparata]]&lt;ref&gt;Anna Jameson, ''Sacred and Legendary Art'' (Longman, Brown, Green, 1857), 648.&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Torpes of Pisa|Saint Torpes]].

==Legend==
Tradition holds that she was a [[Corsican people|Corsican]] woman born around 283 AD at [[Mariana, Corsica|Mariana]].  A young virgin, she had decided to devote herself fully to the service of God. Devota was part the household of senator Eutychius. During the Diocletian persecution, the prefect Barbarus arrived in Corsica with a fleet and when he learned that the senator was harboring a Christian in his  house, demanded that she be given up and compelled to perform the requisite sacrifice to the imperial cult. Eutychius refused, and not wishing to confront him directly, Barbarus arranged to have him poisoned. Devota was imprisoned and tortured for her faith.  Her mouth was crushed, and her body was dragged through rocks and [[brambles]].  She was martyred at Mariana by being [[Rack (torture)|racked]] or [[stoning|stoned]] to death.&lt;ref name=autogenerated2&gt;[https://translate.google.com/translate?u=http://santiebeati.it/Detailed/92244.html&amp;langpair=it%7Cen&amp;hl=it&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;oe=UTF-8&amp;prev=%2Flanguage_tools Arduino, Fabio. "Santa Devota", Santa e Beati]&lt;/ref&gt;

After her death, the governor of the province ordered for her body to be burnt to prevent its veneration.  However, it was saved from the flames by Christians.  Her body was placed on a boat bound for [[Africa (Roman province)|Africa]].  Gratianus (Graziano), the boat's [[Harbour pilot|pilot]]; Benedict (Benenato), a priest; and Apollinaris, his deacon; believed it would receive proper Christian burial there.  However, a storm overtook the boat. A dove appeared and guided the boat to present-day Les Gaumates, today part of the Principality of Monaco, where a chapel dedicated to [[Saint George]] stood.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=PBgYAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA229&amp;dq=Saint+Devota&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=oDkfVcTyMMKwggTh0IG4CQ&amp;ved=0CC0Q6AEwAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=Saint%20Devota&amp;f=false Dunbar, Agnes Baillie Cunninghame. "St. Devota", ''A Dictionary of Saintly Women'', Bell, 1904]&lt;/ref&gt;

In her honor a chapel was built, which stands in Monaco still.  Traditionally, flowers are said to bloom before their season on January 27, the saint's feast day.

==Sainte-Dévote Chapel==
{{further|Sainte-Dévote Chapel}}
The Sainte-Dévote Chapel is first mentioned about 1070, belonging to the abbey of [[Pontius of Cimiez|Saint Pons]]. The chapel was rebuilt and expanded several times.  It became a priory in the 13th century and in 1536 was acquired by [[Honoré I, Lord of Monaco]]. The chapel became the parish church in 1887.{{sfn|Monaco,|Sainte Devote Church}}

==Veneration in Monaco==
The “Legend of Saint Devota” is one of the Principality of Monaco’s oldest traditions – it has influenced national culture in fields as diverse as religion, folklore and popular beliefs, history, literature, the arts, painting, music, coins and stamps. This legend, passed on through a medieval document, holds a special place in the heart of Monaco's people and over the centuries has been awarded a permanent place in the city's history.&lt;ref name=Prince&gt;[http://www.palais.mc/en/news/h-s-h-prince-albert-ii/event/2013/january/saint-devota-s-feast-2958.html "Saint Devota's Feast", Palais Princier de Monaco, January 27, 2013]&lt;/ref&gt;
Reports of miracles soon sprung in connection with the tomb.  During incursions by [[Moors]], Devota's relics were translated to safety at the monastery of [[Cimiez]].  They were returned to Monaco, to a church restored much later by [[Antonio I of Monaco|Antonio I]], prince of Monaco.

In 1070, Antinope, the captain of a [[Florence|Florentine]] ship, attempted to steal the reliquary containing Devota's relics.  The legend states that a violent wind impeded him from escaping with the relics.  Arrested, Ugo Grimaldi ordered his ears and nose to be cut off.  Antinope's boat was then burnt on the beach of Monaco.&lt;ref name=autogenerated2 /&gt;

In the 16th century, Devota was invoked for protection against the [[Genoa|Genoese]] and the [[Pisa]]ns.  Their ultimate failure to take away the independence of Monaco was attributed to the divine protection of Devota.  An end to the outbreak of the [[Bubonic plague|plague]] in 1631 was attributed to Devota, as well as the expulsion of the [[Spain|Spanish]] on the night of 17 November 1641 -a [[galley]] taken from the Spanish was rebaptized "Devota."  Monégasque [[coin]]s bearing the effigy of Devota were issued in the 16th century, beginning in the reign of [[Honoré II, Prince of Monaco]]. During his reign, Devota became the patroness of Monaco.&lt;ref name=Prince/&gt;

A series of postage stamps bearing Devota's likeness were issued in 1944 as well as 1992.

However, one source has commented that "Saint Devota's name is unfortunately heard on the radio waves solely for the [[Monaco Grand Prix|Monaco's Grand Prix Formula 1]] for the famous bend of Saint Devota."&lt;ref&gt;http://www.saintedevote.com/m3.html  {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070325003024/http://www.saintedevote.com/m3.html |date=March 25, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Joseph Méry]] put the legend of Saint Devota into verse.  The first book written in [[Monegasque language]] by the Monegasque poet, [[Louis Notari]], is entitled ''A legenda de Santa Devota'' (The Legend of Saint Devota). It was composed in 1927 and is important because until then the [[Monégasque language]], had been utilized for speech.&lt;ref&gt;[http://saintedevotemonaco.com/en/saint-devote-patron-saint-of-monaco Saint Devote, patron saint of Monaco]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Feast Day===
Her cult became important to Monaco and the Grimaldis.  Since 1874 it has been the custom that on the evening before her feast day a symbolic fishing boat is brought in procession into Port-Hercule and set alight outside the Église Sainte Dévote. This is followed by a fireworks display that lights up Port-Hercule.&lt;ref name=Prince/&gt;

On January 27, Mass is celebrated in the Cathedral of Our Lady of the Immaculate Conception attended by HSH Prince Albert II and HSH Princess Charlene. It is followed by a Solemn Procession of the Relics, to request protection for the Royal Family and the Principality. Receptions in the [[Monte Carlo Opera House]] also take place.  [[Albert II, Prince of Monaco]] participates in this ceremony.&lt;ref&gt;http://worldroots.com/brigitte/royal/gifs/albertmonaco40.jpg  {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20051130053443/http://worldroots.com/brigitte/royal/gifs/albertmonaco40.jpg |date=November 30, 2005 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2014 the Monegasque Rugby Federation, in association with the Princess Charlene of Monaco Foundation, organized the Saint Devota Rugby Challenge. Including teams from Spain and Italy, the free program includes educational workshops and circuits for disabled children, to introduce them to the game.

==Diffusion of cult in Corsica==
In the 1687, some of Devota's relics were transported from Monaco to the [[Jesuit]] church of Sant'Ignazio on the island. Between 1727 and 1751, attempts were made to receive from the [[Holy See|Vatican]] official recognition of Devota as special patroness of Corsica. These were refused because there was scant evidence of her existence. However, the diffusion of her cult continued and [[Pasquale Paoli]] created a short-lived "Order of Saint Devota" in 1757 during the movement for Corsican independence.

In 1820, the first bishop of the diocese of Corsica proclaimed both Saint Devota and Saint Julia to be the principal patron saints of Corsica.  In 1893, a church was dedicated to Saint Devota on the island.  Her cult was officially approved in 1984 by the [[bishop of Ajaccio]].  The new ''[[Martyrology|Roman Martyrology]]'' commemorates her on January 27, with the description, "At Mariana, on the island of Corsica, in memory of Saint Devota, virgin and martyr."&lt;ref name=autogenerated2 /&gt;

[[File:2004 Monaco 5 euro Saint Devote back.jpg|thumb|[[Euro gold and silver commemorative coins (Monaco)#2004 Coinage|1700th anniversary of Saint Devota's death commemorative coin]]]]

==Legacy==
Saint Devota was recently selected as the main motif of a high value collector's coin; the €5 silver [[Euro gold and silver commemorative coins (Monaco)#2004 Coinage|1700th anniversary of Saint Devota's death commemorative coin]], minted in 2004. On the reverse of the coin, a statue of the saint can be seen. Next to it, a representation of the dove guiding the boat to the coast of Monaco, as recorded in the legend, can be observed.

The '''Dhaka Club''' (formerly spelled as Dacca Club) is the oldest recreation organisation and the largest of elite clubs in [[Dhaka]]. Originally it was an all-white association and it now is the premier elite association in [[Bangladesh]].

==Description==
Dhaka club has been described as "an oasis of calm in a frantic city, a colonial relic with several acres of lawns, tennis courts, reading rooms."&lt;ref&gt;Malcolm Miles, Iain Borden and Tim Hall, ''The City Cultures Reader'', page 77, Psychology Press, 2000, {{ISBN|9780415207348}}&lt;/ref&gt; It has been noted that "the real old-school Dhaka wealth and political power calls this recreation club home."&lt;ref name=leung/&gt; According to journalist [[M. J. Akbar]], "In times of ferment the city is ruled by Dhaka University; in times of peace the city is controlled by Dhaka Club."&lt;ref name=akbar/&gt;

The club is located near Shahbag Intersection. It is surrounded by [[Dhaka University]], [[Bangladesh National Museum]], Hotel Sheraton, [[Bangladesh Institute of Research and Rehabilitation for Diabetes, Endocrine and Metabolic Disorders|BIRDEM Hospital]], [[Ramna Park]] and the [[Suhrawardy Udyan]].&lt;ref name=siraj&gt;{{cite book |last=Islam |first=Sirajul |year=2012 |chapter=Dhaka Club |chapter-url=http://en.banglapedia.org/index.php?title=Dhaka_Club |editor1-last=Islam |editor1-first=Sirajul |editor1-link=Sirajul Islam |editor2-last=Jamal |editor2-first=Ahmed A. |title=Banglapedia: National Encyclopedia of Bangladesh |edition=Second |publisher=[[Asiatic Society of Bangladesh]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The club has facilities for meetings and seminars, as well as hall rooms, guest-rooms, kitchens and dining rooms, playing courts and rooms for table tennis, billiards, cards, squash, and lawn tennis, and a swimming pool.&lt;ref name=siraj/&gt; The wood-paneled club house is one of the few surviving British Raj era buildings in Dhaka.&lt;ref name=mamun/&gt; The Dhaka Club has three clay tennis courts and two squash courts.&lt;ref&gt;''Bangladesh, post report'', page 12, U.S. Dept. of State, 1985&lt;/ref&gt; In former times, indoor and outdoor games were dominant features of the club. At present, it gives considerable attention to cultural activities.&lt;ref name=siraj/&gt;

==History==
[[Image:Ramna Racecourse.jpg|left|thumb|Pavilion of Ramna Racecourse in early 20th century, owned and managed together with Gymkhana Club]]
[[File:Dhaka Club 1890.jpg|thumb|The old club house in 1890]]

The origins of the club date back to 1825 when European residents in [[Old Dhaka]] established a [[Gentleman's club]] in Victoria Park (now known as [[Bahadur Shah Park]]) by that name.&lt;ref name=mamun&gt;Muntasir Mamun, "ঢাকা: স্মৃতি বিস্মৃতির নগরী" (''Dhaka, Smriti Bismritir Nogori''), 3rd Edition, 4th Printing, January 2004, Ananya Publishers, Dhaka, Page 104, {{ISBN|9844121043}}।&lt;/ref&gt; It was established in place of an older club known as the Armenian Club or the ''Antagar'' (a [[Corruption (linguistics)|corruption]] of ''Addagar'' or Gossip House). The last name rendered its name to the park which came to be known as ''Antagar Maidan'' (Antaghor Field).&lt;ref name=mamun/&gt;&lt;ref name=siraj2&gt;Sirajul Islam, ''Journal of the Asiatic Society of Bangladesh: Humanities'' (Vol. 45, Issue 1), page 39, Asiatic Society of Bangladesh, 2000&lt;/ref&gt; After the club shifted elsewhere [[East India Company]] bought the land in 1862.&lt;ref name=siraj2/&gt; In 1851 the club premise shifted to [[Ramna]] with help from local aristocrats along with Europeans. The land of Dhaka Club was leased out from the [[Dhaka Nawab Family]] from his Shahbag garden estate.&lt;ref name=siraj/&gt;&lt;ref name=mamun/&gt;&lt;ref name=siraj2/&gt;&lt;ref name=siraj2/&gt;

After the partition of Bengal in 1905, dhaka was made the capital of the new province of Eastern Bengal and Assam. The British civilians, who came to govern the new province, felt the need of a social club.&lt;ref name=siraj/&gt; The club was fashioned after the model of the [[Bengal Club]] of Kolkata. It was registered on 19 August 1911 and was granted legal status on 14 September 1911 under the Indian Companies Act of 1882.&lt;ref name=mamun/&gt; The founding members were Lt. Col. EA Hall (Civil Surgeon, Dhaka), CR Bryan, HG Bally (Commandant, Military Police Battalion, Dhaka), JO Rennie (PWD, Dhaka), and JS Wilson and AT Halliday of Indian Police, Dhaka.&lt;ref name=siraj/&gt;

According to journalist [[M. J. Akbar]], "The British reunited Bengal in 1911 and compensated Dhaka with the [[Dhaka University]] and the Dhaka Club."&lt;ref name=akbar&gt;M. J. Akbar, ''[https://books.google.com.bd/books?id=LhNvjm3M7VgC&amp;pg=PA111&amp;dq=%22dhaka+club%22&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=dC4rVei7NJLbuQTD3YHgCw&amp;ved=0CDIQ6AEwAw#v=onepage&amp;q=%22dhaka%20club%22&amp;f=false Byline]'', page 111, Chronicle Books, 2003, {{ISBN|9788180280030}}&lt;/ref&gt; The membership of the club grew quickly in the 1920s and '30s as many Europeans came to Dhaka in connection with the [[jute trade]], [[Peninsular and Oriental Steam Navigation Company|steam navigation]], the [[Assam Bengal Railway|railway]], and [[Zamindar|estate management]]. Many of the members were high-ranking British officers from [[Minto Road, Dhaka|Minto Road]]. Natives, including aristocrats of [[Dhaka Nawab Family]], were banned, while [[Anglo-Indian]]s had full access.&lt;ref&gt;Nehal Adil, "[http://www.thefinancialexpress-bd.com/old/index.php?ref=MjBfMDJfMTZfMTNfMV85OV8xNjAzNDI= Anglo-Indians in Dhaka]", ''Financial Express'', 02-16-2013&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1941, the [[Governor of Bengal]] leased out a tract of land comprising 524 bighas (173 acres) to the Dhaka Club. The club used the land to develop a racecourse (known as ramna racecourse, now converted into Ramna Garden), a golf course, the club buildings and playgrounds.&lt;ref name=siraj/&gt; The golf course is one of the oldest golf courses in South Asia, and was owned and managed by Dhaka Club and nearby Gymkhana Club together.&lt;ref&gt;Correspondent, "[http://www.thefinancialexpress-bd.com/old/2007/11/12/17006.html Dhaka Club denies charge of grabbing]", ''Financial Express'', 11-12-2007&lt;/ref&gt; Gymkhana Club, located at the opposing side of Shahbag gardens, also patronized the Racecourse together with Dhaka Club.&lt;ref&gt;SD Khan, "[http://archive.thedailystar.net/magazine/2005/11/01/retrospect.htm The Race Course Maidan That Once Was]", ''Daily Star'', 11, 11-11-2005&lt;/ref&gt; During Bangladesh Liberation War the club was closed accept for a few staff. On 26 March 1971 Pakistani army tried to enter the club but Madhuraj, the [[Nepalis|Nepali]] security guard, refused entry. He along with few other staff were executed by [[Pakistan Army|Pakistan army]] after they forcefully entered the club. After the [[Independence of Bangladesh]], the club adapted more Bengali characteristics. In 1973 it changed the Letter head of the club to Bangla. In 1978 [[Geetiara Safya Chowdhury]] became the first female member of the club.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://archive.thedailystar.net/magazine/2008/08/05/anniversary.htm|title=Aging Remarkably Well|last=Amin|first=Aasha Mehreen|date=|website=archive.thedailystar.net|publisher=The Daily Star|access-date=2016-11-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; Into the 21st century the club arrived with only about 5 acres (20,000 m2) of land left in its control, as the rest has been overtaken by the government of Bangladesh by acquisition.&lt;ref name=siraj/&gt;&lt;ref name=mamun/&gt;

==Rules==

The club is run by an executive committee comprising a president and 10 members who are elected for a one-year term in a general meeting.&lt;ref name=siraj/&gt; The right to vote is limited to 1,500 permanent and life members as well as general members. who form a highly privileged company. That total figure of 1,500 is strictly protected, though any member can resign and nominate his successor. A past president was forced to resign because he “accidentally” allowed this limit to be exceeded that number.&lt;ref name=akbar/&gt; Foreigners can become members for an annual fee.&lt;ref name=leung&gt;Mikey Leung and Belinda Meggitt (ed.), ''[https://books.google.com.bd/books?id=cdkILWIONLQC&amp;pg=PA145&amp;dq=%22dhaka+club%22&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=dC4rVei7NJLbuQTD3YHgCw&amp;ved=0CCgQ6AEwAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=%22dhaka%20club%22&amp;f=false Bangladesh]'', page 147, Bradt Travel Guides, 2012, {{ISBN|9781841624099}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, members are of different categories such as life members, general members, honorary members, special members, and officers of the defense forces. The total number of members of the club in 2016 was 3,120, a figure that is considered as the highest membership limit.&lt;ref name=siraj/&gt;

The rules and regulations of the remain the same from the times of the [[British Raj|Raj]]. No locals are permitted in the lounge, the bar, the dining room or the card room.&lt;ref name=akbar/&gt; The only concession that the Dhaka Club has made is to permit the loose kurta inside its premises.&lt;ref name=akbar/&gt; For men the dress rule is collared shirt and covered shoes.&lt;ref name=leung/&gt;

{{Unreferenced|date=December 2009}}
'''Digor''' is a traditional sport in [[Bhutan]], resembling the sport of [[shot put]].

[[Image:Playing Degor.JPG|thumb|250px|left| Playing degor]]

‘Degor’ is a traditional [[Bhutan]]ese [[game]] which is often mistakenly referred in literatures as a kind of shot put by foreign [[authors]]. It differs from shot put in many ways. It is played with a pair of spherical flat [[stones]] that are hurled at two targets (pegs) fixed in the ground at a distance of about 20 meters apart. The game is played all over [[Bhutan]], but is normally played more in [[rural areas]]. Although there are no restrictions, the game is normally played in [[Bhutan]] by [[men]].

The only required [[Sports equipment|equipment]] for playing the [[game]] is a pair of flat spherical stones for each player. The [[Dimension|size]] and [[weight]] of the [[stones]] differ from player to [[player (game)|player]] depending on his [[choice]] and [[Physical strength|strength]]. A player can have as many [[stones]] of any size as he wants, but can play only two at a time.

Degor can be played as a [[team game]] or individual game. If there are three [[person]]s, the game is played as on individual gaming basis. If there are four or more persons, it is preferred to be played in two teams that compete against each other. There is no fixed numbers of players on the teams, but too many players make the game slower and [[cumbersome]]. So, normally seven players on each team is the maximum number for an ideal game.

Unlike shot put, each player hurls a pair of spherical [[stones]] to the targets from one end to the other by swinging the arm below the shoulders. The target pegs are nailed into the ground with their tips at ground level. As in [[horseshoes]], the players try to make their stone land and remain closest to the target peg. A point is scored if the distance between stone and the peg is less than the distance between the thumb and middle finger of an outstretched palm. If two or more stones of opponent teams fall in same range, the closest stone will score the point. If all stones in the range belong to one team, then the team will score as many points as the number of stones. There is no fixed point score at which the game ends, but it is normally fixed at odd numbers up to 21, depending on the number of the players and the time the [[team]]s have.

Unlike in archery, in Degor the best players play first to occupy the area near the target. The players playing later are allowed to hit the stones of opponent players that have been played before with their own stones to displace them from the target and replace them with their stones. But it is more difficult if the stones played beforehand are heavy and solid. So, players prefer heavier stones so that these cannot be easily displaced or can be used as a better force to displace other players' stones.

Betting on the game differs from region to region and the occasion of the game being played. If the game is being played between villages, there may or may not be a bet. At times it is just played for the fame of victory. However, the game is mostly played to celebrate some occasions such as [[New Year]] and other major holidays. On such occasions, the betting is normally fixed on a grand feast and party where the loser will have to stand for the party solely or major chunk while the winner could share a little part. This kind of betting usually occurs for merrymaking and socializing within the [[community|communities]] or among the [[friend]]s.

==History==
[[Image:Ojibweherbalistmedicine.png|thumb|Plants have been widely used by [[indigenous peoples of the Americas|Native American]] healers, such as this [[Ojibwa]] man.]]
The idea of ethnobotany was first proposed by the early 20th century botanist [[John William Harshberger]].&lt;ref name=auto&gt;{{cite book|last1=White|first1=James T.|title=The National cyclopædia of American biography ... v.21.|date=1931|publisher=University of Michigan}}&lt;/ref&gt; While Harshberger did perform ethnobotanical research extensively, including in areas such as North Africa, Mexico, Scandinavia, and Pennsylvania,&lt;ref name=auto/&gt; it was not until [[Richard Evans Schultes]] began his trips into the Amazon that ethnobotany become a more well known science.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Ponman, Bussmann|first1=Bruce E, Rainer W.|title=Medicinal Plants and the Legacy of Richard E. Schultes|year=2012|publisher=Missouri Botanical Garden|isbn=0984841520|url=http://www.nybg.org/files/scientists/mbalick/Balick_preprint.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the practice of ethnobotany is thought to have much earlier origins in the first century AD when a Greek physician by the name of [[Pedanius Dioscorides]] wrote an extensive botanical text detailing the medical and culinary properties of "over 600 mediterranean plants" named [[De Materia Medica]].&lt;ref name=eplantscience/&gt; Historians note that Dioscorides wrote about traveling often throughout the Roman empire, including regions such as "Greece, Crete, Egypt, and Petra",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Mazal, Otto|title=Dioscorides: De Materia Medica|url=http://penelope.uchicago.edu/~grout/encyclopaedia_romana/aconite/materiamedica.html|website=Uchicago.edu|publisher=[[University of Chicago]]|accessdate=2 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; and in doing so obtained substantial knowledge about the local plants and their useful properties. European botanical knowledge drastically expanded once the New World was discovered due to ethnobotany. This expansion in knowledge can be primarily attributed to the substantial influx of new plants from the Americas, including crops such as potatoes, peanuts, avocados, and tomatoes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://nationalhumanitiescenter.org/tserve/nattrans/ntecoindian/essays/columbianb.htm|title=The Columbian Exchange, Native Americans and the Land, Nature Transformed, TeacherServe, National Humanities Center|website=nationalhumanitiescenter.org|publisher=[[National Humanities Center]]|accessdate=2 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; One French explorer in the 16th century, [[Jacques Cartier]],  learned a cure for scurvy (a tea made from boiling the bark of the Sitka Spruce) from a local [[Iroquois]] tribe.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.for.gov.bc.ca/hfd/library/documents/treebook/sitkaspruce.htm|title=Sitka spruce|website=www.for.gov.bc.ca|place=[[British Columbia]]|accessdate=2 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Medieval and Renaissance==
During the medieval period, ethnobotanical studies were commonly found connected with [[Christian monasticism#Contributions|monasticism]]. Notable at this time was [[Hildegard of Bingen|Hildegard von Bingen]]. However, most botanical knowledge was kept in gardens such as [[physic garden]]s attached to hospitals and religious buildings. It was thought of in practical use terms for culinary and medical purposes and the ethnographic element was not studied as a modern [[anthropologist]] might approach ethnobotany today.{{cn|date=May 2018}}

==Age of Reason==
Carl Linnaeus carried out in 1732 a [[Expedition to Lapland|research expedition]] in Scandinavia asking the [[Sami people]] about their [[Ethnology|ethnological]] usage of plants.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Before Boas: The Genesis of Ethnography and Ethnology in the German Enlightenment Critical Studies in the History of Anthropology Series|author=Han F. Vermeulen|publisher=[[University of Nebraska Press]]|year=2015|isbn=9780803277380}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[age of enlightenment]] saw a rise in economic [[botanical]] exploration. [[Alexander von Humboldt]] collected data from the New World, and [[James Cook]]'s voyages brought back collections and information on plants from the South Pacific. At this time major botanical gardens were started, for instance the [[Royal Botanic Gardens, Kew]] in 1759. The directors of the gardens sent out [[List of gardener-botanist explorers of the Enlightenment|gardener-botanist explorers]] to care for and collect plants to add to their collections.

As the 18th century became the 19th, ethnobotany saw expeditions undertaken with more colonial aims rather than trade economics such as that of [[Lewis and Clark Expedition|Lewis and Clarke]] which recorded both plants and the peoples encountered use of them. [[Edward Palmer (botanist)|Edward Palmer]] collected [[material culture]] artifacts and botanical specimens from people in the North American West ([[Great Basin]]) and Mexico from the 1860s to the 1890s. Through all of this research, the field of "aboriginal botany" was established—the study of all forms of the vegetable world which [[indigenous peoples|aboriginal peoples]] use for food, medicine, [[textile]]s, ornaments and more.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title= Economic Botany: Principles and Practices|author=G.E. Wickens|edition=illustrated|publisher=Springer Science &amp; Business Media|year=2012|isbn=9789401009690|page=8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Development and application in modern science==
The first individual to study the [[emic]] perspective of the plant world was a German physician working in Sarajevo at the end of the 19th century: Leopold Glück. His published work on traditional medical uses of plants done by rural people in Bosnia (1896) has to be considered the first modern ethnobotanical work.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Ethnobotany and Biocultural Diversities in the Balkans: Perspectives on Sustainable Rural Development and Reconciliation|editor=Andrea Pieroni, Cassandra L. Quave|edition=illustrated|publisher=Springer|year=2014|isbn=9781493914920|page=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;
 
Other scholars analyzed uses of plants under an indigenous/local perspective in the 20th century: [[Matilda Coxe Stevenson]], Zuni plants (1915); [[Frank Hamilton Cushing|Frank Cushing]], Zuni foods (1920); [[Keewaydinoquay Peschel]], Anishinaabe fungi (1998), and the team approach of Wilfred Robbins, [[John Peabody Harrington]], and [[Barbara Freire-Marreco]], Tewa pueblo plants (1916).

In the beginning, ethonobotanical specimens and studies were not very reliable and sometimes not helpful. This is because the botanists and the anthropologists did not always collaborate in their work. The botanists focused on identifying species and how the plants were used instead of concentrating upon how plants fit into people's lives. On the other hand, anthropologists were interested in the cultural role of plants and treated other scientific aspects superficially. In the early 20th century, botanists and anthropologists better collaborated and the collection of reliable, detailed cross-disciplinary data began.

Beginning in the 20th century, the field of ethnobotany experienced a shift from the raw compilation of data to a greater methodological and conceptual reorientation. This is also the beginning of academic ethnobotany. The so-called "father" of this discipline is [[Richard Evans Schultes]], even though he did not actually coin the term "ethnobotany". Today the field of ethnobotany requires a variety of skills: botanical training for the identification and preservation of plant specimens; anthropological training to understand the cultural concepts around the perception of plants; linguistic training, at least enough to transcribe local terms and understand native morphology, syntax, and semantics.

[[Mark Plotkin]], who studied at [[Harvard University]], the [[Yale School of Forestry]] and [[Tufts University]], has contributed a number of books on ethnobotany. He completed a handbook for the [[Tirio people]] of [[Suriname]] detailing their medicinal plants; ''Tales of a Shaman's Apprentice'' (1994); ''The Shaman's Apprentice,'' a children's book with Lynne Cherry (1998); and  ''Medicine Quest: In Search of Nature's Healing Secrets'' (2000).

Plotkin was interviewed in 1998 by ''[[South American Explorers|South American Explorer]]'' magazine, just after the release of ''Tales of a Shaman's Apprentice'' and the [[IMAX]] movie Amazonia. In the book, he stated that he saw wisdom in both traditional and Western forms of medicine:
&lt;blockquote&gt;No medical system has all the answers—no shaman that I've worked with has the equivalent of a polio vaccine and no dermatologist that I've been to could cure a fungal infection as effectively (and inexpensively) as some of my Amazonian mentors. It shouldn't be the doctor versus the witch doctor. It should be the best aspects of all medical systems ([[Ayurveda|ayurvedic]], [[herbalism]], [[Homeopathy|homeopathic]], and so on) combined in a way which makes health care more effective and more affordable for all.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Shaman's Apprentice|accessdate=May 2, 2018}} ''South American Explorer'', Autumn 1988&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

A great deal of information about the traditional uses of plants is still intact with tribal peoples.&lt;ref&gt;Sood, S.K., Nath, R. and Kalia, D.C. 2001. ''Ethnobotany of Cold Desert Tribes of Lahoul-Spiti'' (''N.W. Himalaya''). Deep Publications, New Delhi.&lt;/ref&gt; But the native healers are often reluctant to accurately share their knowledge to outsiders. Schultes actually apprenticed himself to an Amazonian shaman, which involves a long-term commitment and genuine relationship. In ''Wind in the Blood: Mayan Healing &amp; Chinese Medicine'' by Garcia et al. the visiting acupuncturists were able to access levels of Mayan medicine that anthropologists could not because they had something to share in exchange. Cherokee medicine priest [[David Winston]] describes how his uncle would invent nonsense to satisfy visiting anthropologists.&lt;ref&gt;''Wind in the Blood: Mayan Healing and Chinese Medicine'', by Hernan Garcia, Antonio Sierra, Hilberto Balam, and Jeff Connant&lt;/ref&gt;

Another scholar, James W. Herrick, who studied under ethnologist [[William N. Fenton]], in his work ''Iroquois Medical Ethnobotany'' (1995) with Dean R. Snow (editor), professor of Anthropology at Penn State, explains that understanding herbal medicines in traditional Iroquois cultures is rooted in a strong and ancient [[cosmological]] belief system.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=American Indian Culture and Research Journal|volume=20|issue=2|publisher=American Indian Culture and Research Center, University of California|year=1996|page=213}}&lt;/ref&gt; Their work provides perceptions and conceptions of illness and imbalances which can manifest in physical forms from benign maladies to serious diseases. It also includes a large compilation of Herrick’s field work from numerous Iroquois authorities of over 450 names, uses, and preparations of plants for various ailments. Traditional Iroquois practitioners had (and have) a sophisticated perspective on the plant world that contrast strikingly with that of modern medical science.&lt;ref&gt;Herrick, J. W. (1995). ''Iroquois Medical Botany''. Syracuse, NY: [[Syracuse University Press]].&lt;/ref&gt;

Researcher Cassandra Quave at Emory University has used ethnobotany to address the problems that arise from antibiotic resistance. Quave notes that the advantage of medical ethnobotany over Western medicine rests in the difference in mechanism. For example, elmleaf blackberry extract focuses instead on the prevention of bacterial collaboration as opposed to directly exterminating them. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2016/09/18/magazine/could-ancient-remedies-hold-the-answer-to-the-looming-antibiotics-crisis.html|title=Could Ancient Remedies Hold the Answer to the Looming Antibiotics Crisis?|access-date=2018-10-26|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Issues==
{{clarify section|reason=it should explain what kind of gender biases exist, and how they came to be|date=September 2017}}
Many instances of [[gender bias]] have occurred in ethnobotany, creating the risk of drawing erroneous conclusions. Anthropologists would often consult with primarily men. In Las Pavas, a small farming community in Panama, anthropologists drew conclusions about the entire community's use of plant from their conversations and lessons with mostly men. They consulted with 40 families, but the women only participated rarely in interviews and never joined them in the field. Due to the division of labor, the knowledge of wild plants for food, medicine, and fibers, among others, was left out of the picture, resulting in a distorted view of which plants were actually important to them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=https://www.academia.edu/163864/Gender_Bias_in_Ethnobotany_Propositions_and_Evidence_of_a_Distorted_Science_and_Promises_of_a_Brighter_Future|title=Gender Bias in Ethnobotany: Propositions and Evidence of a Distorted Science and Promises of a Brighter Future.|author=Howard, Patricia|website=academia.edu}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7K0s__h3ipY|title=Gender bias in ethnobotany -- a legacy and process|publisher=TeachEthnobotany|date=2 July 2013|via=[[YouTube]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Ethnobotanists have also assumed that ownership of a resource means familiarity with that resource. In some societies women are excluded from owning land, while being the ones who work it. Inaccurate data can come from interviewing only the owners.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Jeanine M. Pfeiffer|author2=Ramona J. Butz|year=2005|title=Assessing Cultural And Ecological Variation In Ethnobiological Research: The Importance Of Gender|url=http://scholarworks.sjsu.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1002&amp;context=envs_pub|journal=Journal of Ethnobiology|publisher=[[San Jose State University]]|volume=25|issue=2|pages=240–278|doi=10.2993/0278-0771(2005)25[240:ACAEVI]2.0.CO;2}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Other issues include ethical concerns regarding interactions with [[indigenous populations]], and the International Society of Ethnobiology has created a code of ethics to guide researchers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ethnobiology.net/what-we-do/core-programs/ise-ethics-program/code-of-ethics/|title=The ISE Code of Ethics - International Society of Ethnobiology|website=ethnobiology.net|accessdate=2 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{mergeto|Shared universe|date=May 2018}}
The term '''expanded universe''', sometimes called an '''extended universe''', is generally used to denote the "extension" of a [[media franchise]] (like a television program or a series of feature films) with other media, generally comics and original novels. This typically involves new stories for existing characters already developed within the franchise, but in some cases entirely new characters and complex mythology are developed. This is not necessarily the same as an adaptation, which is a retelling of the same story that may or may not adhere to accepted [[canon (fiction)|canon]]. Nearly every media franchise with a committed fan base has some form of expanded universe.

==Examples==
Two prominent examples of media franchises with an expanded universe are ''[[Star Wars]]''&lt;ref name="Knight2010"&gt;{{cite book|author=Gladys L. Knight|title=Female Action Heroes: A Guide to Women in Comics, Video Games, Film, and Television|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=0PKSFHwhTGYC&amp;pg=PA240|year=2010|publisher=ABC-CLIO|isbn=978-0-313-37612-2|pages=240–241}}&lt;/ref&gt; and ''[[Star Trek]]'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Expanded Universe: ''Star Trek''|publisher=Empire|accessdate=23 November 2013|url=http://www.empireonline.com/features/star-trek-expanded-universe}}&lt;/ref&gt; which both have a wide range of original novels, comics, video games, and other media that add to the mythology of their fictional universe in different ways. In both cases, entirely new characters and situations have been developed that exist only within the expanded universe media.&lt;ref name="SW Legends"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.starwars.com/news/the-legendary-star-wars-expanded-universe-turns-a-new-page |title=The Legendary ''Star Wars Expanded Universe'' Turns a New Page |publisher=StarWars.com |date=April 25, 2014 |accessdate=May 26, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="THR Legends"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/heat-vision/lucasfilm-unveils-new-plans-star-698973 |last=McMilian |first=Graeme |title=Lucasfilm Unveils New Plans for ''Star Wars Expanded Universe'' |work=[[The Hollywood Reporter]] |date=April 25, 2014 |accessdate=May 26, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Canonicity==
Although there are some exceptions, expanded universe works are generally accepted as [[Canon (fiction)|canon]], or part of the "official" storyline continuity. Otherwise, they are considered [[Apocrypha (fiction)|apocrypha]]. In some cases, characters created for an expanded universe are later featured in the primary works associated with that franchise, as in the cases of [[Aayla Secura]] and [[Grand Admiral Thrawn]] in the ''Star Wars'' franchise.&lt;ref name="Filoni CB"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://comicbook.com/starwars/2017/02/20/star-wars-lucasfilm-legends-expanded-universe-george-lucas/|title=''Star Wars'': Dave Filoni Explains George Lucas and Lucasfilm's Relationship with ''Legends''|publisher=Comicbook.com|first=Lucas|last=Siegel|date=February 20, 2017|accessdate=February 24, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="UT Rebels"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/life/tv/2016/07/16/thrawn-star-wars-rebels-celebration/87180842/ |title=Thrawn to make grand appearance in ''Star Wars Rebels'' |work=[[USA Today]] |first=Brian |last=Truitt |date=July 16, 2016 |accessdate=July 16, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; When all expanded universe works (films, novels, comic books, video games, role-playing games, etc.) are considered canonical, then the expanded universe is an "imaginary entertainment environment."&lt;ref&gt;Mackay, Daniel.

In Latin literature, ''focale'' is a general word for a scarf or wrapping for the throat.&lt;ref&gt;[[:fr:Antoine Mongez|Antoine Mongez]], "Recherches sur les habillemens des anciens," ''Histoire et mémoires de l'Institute Royal de France'' 4 (1818), pp. 295–295.&lt;/ref&gt; A ''focale'' was one of the gifts that might be given for the December festival of [[Saturnalia]], according to [[Martial]].&lt;ref&gt;Martial 14.137 (142).&lt;/ref&gt; In one of his [[Satires (Horace)|satires]], [[Horace]] lists ''focalia'' among the "badges of illness" ''(insignia morbi)''.&lt;ref&gt;Horace, ''Satires'' 2.8.255; article on "Dress," ''A Concise Dictionary of Greek and Roman Antiquities'', edited by F. Warre Cornish (London, 1898), p. 259.&lt;/ref&gt; In describing the correct attire for public speaking, [[Quintilian]] advises against wearing a ''focale'', unless required by poor health.&lt;ref&gt;Quintilian [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Quintilian/Institutio_Oratoria/11C*.html#3.144 11.3.144.] [[Legwarmers]] ''(fascias quibus crura vestiuntur)'' and [[earmuffs]] ''(aurium ligamenta)'' are likewise to be avoided.&lt;/ref&gt;

Although a ''sudarium'' often is used as a [[handkerchief]], it can be worn like the ''focale'' as a [[neckerchief]].&lt;ref&gt;Mongez, "Recherches sur les habillemens des anciens," p. 295.&lt;/ref&gt; When [[Suetonius]] describes the overly casual attire of [[Nero]], the emperor is barefoot, unbelted, and dressed in [[formal wear|evening wear]] ''([[Synthesis (clothing)|synthesis]])'', with a ''sudarium'' around his neck.&lt;ref&gt;Suetonius, ''Nero'' 51; Mongez, "Recherches sur les habillemens des anciens," p. 295.&lt;/ref&gt; In late antiquity, ''orarium'' (Greek ''[[orarion]]'') might be synonymous with ''focale'', as in the description of military attire in the ''[[Vision of Dorotheus]]'', and in a [[papyri|papyrus]] (dated 350–450 AD) listing military clothes.&lt;ref&gt;''SB'' VI.9570.5; [[Jan Bremmer]], "An Imperial Palace Guard in Heaven: The Date of the Vision of Dorotheus," ''Zeitschrift für Papyrologie und Epigraphik'' 75 (1988), p. 86.&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''focale'' is sometimes seen as one of the precursors of the [[necktie]].&lt;ref&gt;Daniel K. Hall, ''How to Tie a Tie: Choosing, Coordinating, and Knotting Your Neckwear'' (Sterling, 2008), p. 8.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Cesare Vecellio]] (1530–1606) mentions the ''focale'', calling it a ''cravata'' ([[cravat]]), as worn by Roman soldiers in his book on the history of fashion.&lt;ref&gt;Oscar Lenius, ''The Well-Dressed Gentleman'' (LIT Verlag Münster, 2010), p. 93.&lt;/ref&gt; It has been compared to the ''[[amice]]'' ''(amictus)'' worn by Roman Catholic priests, which is depicted from the 6th century onward, as in the [[Ravenna mosaics]].&lt;ref&gt;Charles Panati, ''Sacred Origins of Profound Things'' (Arkana, 1996), [https://books.google.com/books?id=8xKkiDz4qCwC&amp;pg=PT146&amp;dq=focale+roman+soldier&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=1XgVUunPIqeh2AXx-YGADA&amp;ved=0CFoQ6AEwBw#v=onepage&amp;q=focale%20roman%20soldier&amp;f=false n.p.]; Mongez, "Recherches sur les habillemens des anciens," p. 296.&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''form''' is an [[educational stage]], [[Class (education)|class]], or grouping of pupils in a [[school]]. The term is used predominantly in the [[United Kingdom]], although some schools, mostly [[Private school|private]], in other countries also use the title. Pupils are usually grouped in forms according to age and will remain with the same group for a number of years, or sometimes their entire school career.  In North America, the 1st Form (or sometimes 'Form I') is equivalent to 7th Grade.

==History==
During the [[Victorian era]] a "form" was the bench upon which pupils sat to receive lessons. In some smaller schools the entire school would be educated in a single room, with different age groups sitting on different benches.

==Modern use==
Forms are normally identified by a number such as "first form" or "[[sixth form]]". A form number may be used for two year groups and differentiated by the terms upper and lower. The [[sixth form]] is the senior form of a school.  In England, the 6th Form  ([[Key Stage 5]]) is usually divided into two year groups: the lower sixth and upper sixth, owing to the 3-year English college/university system. In Scotland or North America, the 6th form is usually a single year, owing to the 4-year college/university system.  If there is more than one form for each year group they will normally be differentiated by letters, e.g., "upper four B", "lower two Y". Schools do not follow a consistent pattern in naming forms.

Another common identification for form, and one of the most common in [[New Zealand]], is the number of the year they are in, followed by the initials of the teacher who takes the form class. E.g., a Year 7 form whose teacher is John Smith would be 7JS (or 7SJ or 7SM if there is already another teacher in the school with the initials JS). Alternatively, some schools use "vertical" form classes where pupils across several year groups from the same [[house system|school house]] are grouped together. In this case, the numeral is replaced with the first letter of the house name (e.g. RJS for a Red House form class whose teacher is John Smith).

'''Forum Copenhagen''' ({{lang-da|'''Forum København'''|italic=no}}) is a large multi-purpose, rentable [[indoor arena]] located in [[Frederiksberg]], [[Copenhagen]], [[Denmark]]. It hosts a large variety of [[concerts]], markets, [[exhibitions]] and other events. The venue can hold up to 10,000 people depending on the event. The Forum operates as a [[convention center]], [[concert hall]] and indoor arena.

It was opened in February 1926 to host a car exhibition and was last renovated in 1996–97. Over two storeys there is a combined exhibition floor area of 5,000 m² and a separate restaurant for up to 250 seated guests. The [[Copenhagen Metro|Metro]] station [[Forum station|Forum]] is adjacent to the building.

==History==
[[File:Forum-Copenhagen.jpg|thumb|left|250px|Forum Copenhagen (2005)]]
On 11 August 1925, the construction committee signed the contract to build the venue. On 25 September 1925, Prime Minister [[Thorvald Stauning]] laid the [[foundation stone]] for the construction. Forum opened for the first time on 20 February 1926 for this year's major automotive exhibition. Forum Copenhagen was designed by Oscar Gundlach-Pedersen, and the lighting was from [[Poul Henningsen]]'s brand new [[PH-lamp]].

In 1929 it held an architecture exhibition, which was one of the first presentations of functionalism in Denmark, namely the Housing and Building Exhibition in Forum. It was at this exhibition that [[Arne Jacobsen]] and [[Flemming Lassen]] exhibited their subscription to the cylindrical "House of the Future".

During [[World War II]], the Danish resistance movement group [[Holger Danske (resistance group)|Holger Danske]] destroyed the original hall in an act of sabotage in August 1943.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.din-bog.dk/1940-1945/Region_6/Sabotage/Forum/ Sprængningen af Forum 1943] (baseret på oplysninger i Peter Birkelund: ''Holger Danske Sabotage og likvidering 1943-45'')&lt;/ref&gt; The hall was first rebuilt and extended in 1947. An annual six-day [[bicycle racing|bicycle race]] was originally held here and was later moved to [[Ballerup Super Arena]]. In 1997, the Forum concluded an extensive renovation of the roof costing 70 million [[Danish krone|DKK]], resulting in better acoustic sound and more concerts.

==Concerts and events==
The venue has hosted numerous music acts since its opening.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3642">The '''Gender Parity Index''' ('''GPI''') is a [[socioeconomic]] index usually designed to measure the relative access to [[education]] of males and females. This index is released by UNESCO. In its simplest form, it is calculated as the quotient of the number of females by the number of males enrolled in a given stage of education ([[primary education|primary]], [[secondary education|secondary]], etc.). It is used by international organizations, particularly in measuring the progress of developing countries. The Institute for Statistics of [[UNESCO]] also uses a more general definition of GPI: for any development indicator one can define the GPI ''relative'' to this indicator by dividing its value for females by its value for males.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.unescobkk.org/fileadmin/user_upload/aims/Pattaya_SCB_Jun05/Gender_Parity_Index_-_Michael_Koronkiewicz.pdf |title=Gender Parity Index|last=Koronkiewicz|first=Michael |publisher=UNESCO Bangkok|accessdate=2008-11-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, some UNESCO documents consider gender parity in [[literacy]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://unesdoc.unesco.org/images/0014/001472/147259M.pdf|title=Education for All (EFA) in least developed countries|date=2006|publisher=UNESCO|accessdate=2008-11-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

UNESCO describes attempts to eliminate gender disparities in primary and secondary education and emphasizes the plight of girls in unequal access in third world countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.unescobkk.org/fileadmin/user_upload/aims/Pattaya_SCB_Jun05/Gender_Parity_Index_-_Michael_Koronkiewicz.pdf |title=Gender Parity Index|last=Koronkiewicz|first=Michael |publisher=UNESCO Bangkok|accessdate=2008-11-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the GPI ignores the gender disparity that benefits first-world women in [[tertiary education]] as in Iceland, for example, where 65% of students enrolling in tertiary education are female.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="35984">'''Global commons''' is a term typically used to describe international, supranational, and global [[natural resources|resource]] domains in which [[common-pool resource]]s are found. Global [[commons]] include the earth's shared natural resources, such as the high [[World ocean|oceans]], the [[Earth's atmosphere|atmosphere]] and [[outer space]] and the [[Antarctic]] in particular.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.unep.org/delc/GlobalCommons/tabid/54404/&lt;/ref&gt; [[Cyberspace]] may also meet the definition of a global commons.

==Definition and usage==
"Global commons" is a term typically used to describe [[international]], [[supranational]], and global resource domains in which common-pool resources are found. In [[economics]], [[Common good (economics)|common goods]] are [[Rivalry (economics)|rivalrous]] and [[Excludability|non-excludable]], constituting one of the four main types of [[Good (economics)|goods]].&lt;ref&gt;For current definitions of public goods see any mainstream microeconomics textbook, e.g.: Hal R. Varian, ''Microeconomic Analysis'' {{ISBN|0-393-95735-7}}; [[Andreu Mas-Colell|Mas-Colell]], Whinston &amp; Green,  ''Microeconomic Theory'' {{ISBN|0-19-507340-1}}; or Gravelle &amp; Rees, ''Microeconomics'' {{ISBN|0-582-40487-8}}.&lt;/ref&gt; A [[common-pool resource]], also called a common property resource, is a special case of a common good (or [[public good]]) whose size or characteristics makes it costly, but not impossible, to exclude potential users.  Examples include both natural or human-made resource domains (e.g., a "fishing hole" or an irrigation system). Unlike [[global public good]]s, global common-pool resources face problems of congestion, overuse, or degradation because they are subtractable (which makes them [[rivalrous]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Ostrom |first=Elinor |title=Governing the Commons: The Evolution of Institutions for Collective Action |year=1990 |publisher=Cambridge University Press |location=Cambridge, UK |isbn=0 521 40599 8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The term "commons" originates from the term [[common land]] in the British Isles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |ref=neeson |first=Jeanette M. |last=Neeson |title=Commoners: Common Right, Enclosure and Social Change in England, 1700–1820 |publisher=Cambridge University Press |location=Cambridge, UK |year=1996 |ISBN=978-0521567749}}&lt;/ref&gt; "Commoners rights" referred to traditional rights held by commoners, such as [[mowing]] [[meadow]]s for [[hay]] or [[grazing]] [[livestock]] on common land held in the [[open field system]] of old [[English common law]].  [[Enclosure]] was the process that ended those traditional rights, converting open fields to [[private property]].  Today, many commons still exist in [[England]], [[Wales]], [[Scotland]], and the [[United States]], although their extent is much reduced from the millions of acres that existed until the 17th century.&lt;ref&gt;*{{citation |last=Callander |first=Robin Fraser |year=1987 |title=A pattern of Landownership in Scotland: With Particular Reference to Aberdeenshire |place=Finzean |publisher=Haughend |oclc=60041593}}.&lt;/ref&gt; There are still over 7,000 registered commons in England alone.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/218756/common-land.xls DEFRA Database of registered common land in England] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141129020728/https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/218756/common-land.xls |date=2014-11-29 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The term "global commons" is typically used to indicate the earth's shared natural resources, such as the deep [[World ocean|oceans]], the [[Earth's atmosphere|atmosphere]], [[outer space]] and the Northern and Southern [[polar region]]s, the [[Antarctic]] in particular.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Handbook of Global Environmental Politics (2nd edition) |publisher=Edward Elgar Publishing |location=Cheltenham, UK |author=Dauvergne, Peter (ed.) |year=2012 |isbn=978-1849809405}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the ''World Conservation Strategy'', a report on conservation published by the [[International Union for Conservation of Nature and Natural Resources]] (IUCN) in collaboration with [[UNESCO]] and with the support of the [[United Nations Environment Programme]] (UNEP) and the [[World Wildlife Fund]] (WWF):
{{quote|"A commons is  a tract of land or water owned or used jointly by the members of a community. The global commons includes those parts of the Earth's surface beyond [[Jurisdiction#National|national jurisdictions]]&amp;nbsp;— notably the open ocean and the living resources found there&amp;nbsp;— or held in common&amp;nbsp;— notably the atmosphere. The only landmass that may be regarded as part of the global commons is Antarctica ..."&lt;ref name="WCS"&gt;[http://data.iucn.org/dbtw-wpd/edocs/WCS-004.pdf " Chapter 18, The global commons." ''World Conservation Strategy'', International Union for Conservation of Nature and Natural Resources, accessed 22 May 2009.]&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Today, the [[Internet]], [[World Wide Web]] and resulting [[cyberspace]] are often referred to as global commons.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cigionline.org/publications/2012/10/internet-global-commons Raymond, Mark (2012). "The Internet as a Global Commons?" ''Governing the Internet: Chaos, Control or Consensus?'' The Centre for International Governance Innovation (CIGI).]&lt;/ref&gt;  Other usages sometimes include references to open access information of all kinds, including arts and culture, language and science, though these are more formally referred to as the [[common heritage of mankind]].&lt;ref&gt;Baslar, Kemal (1998). ''The Concept of the Common Heritage of Mankind in International Law''. Martinus Nijhoff Pubs. {{ISBN|978-90-411-0505-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Management of the global commons==
The key challenge of the global commons is the design of governance structures and management systems capable of addressing the complexity of multiple public and private interests, subject to often unpredictable changes, ranging from the local to the global level.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Global Environmental Commons: Analytical and Political Challenges in Building Governance Mechanisms |publisher=Oxford University Press |author=Brousseau, Eric |year=2012 |location=Cambridge, UK |isbn=978-0199656202 |display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt; As with global public goods, management of the global commons requires pluralistic legal entities, usually international and supranational, public and private, structured to match the diversity of interests and the type of resource to be managed, and stringent enough with adequate incentives to ensure compliance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=International Law and Global Public Goods in a Legal Pluralist World |author=Shaffer, Gregory |journal=European Journal of International Law |date=August 2012 |volume=23 |issue=3 |pages=669–693 |doi=10.1093/ejil/chs036}}&lt;/ref&gt; Such management systems are necessary to avoid, at the global level, the classic [[tragedy of the commons]], in which common resources become [[overexploited]].&lt;ref name=hardin68&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1126/science.162.3859.1243 |title=The Tragedy of the Commons |year=1968 |journal=Science |volume=162 |issue=3859 |pages=1243–1248 |pmid=5699198 |bibcode=1968Sci...162.1243H}} Also available here [http://www.sciencemag.org/cgi/reprint/162/3859/1243.pdf] and [http://www.garretthardinsociety.org/articles/art_tragedy_of_the_commons.html here.]&lt;/ref&gt;

There are several key differences in management of resources in the global commons from those of the commons, in general.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://www.thecommonsjournal.org/index.php/ijc/article/view/305/229 |title=Design principles for global commons: natural resources and emerging technologies |author=Stern, Paul C |journal=International Journal of the Commons |volume=5 |issue=2}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are obvious differences in scale of both the resources and the number of users at the local versus the global level.  Also, there are differences in the shared culture and expectations of resource users; more localized commons users tend to be more homogeneous and global users more heterogeneous. This contributes to differences in the possibility and time it takes for new learning about resource usage to occur at the different levels. Moreover, global resource pools are less likely to be relatively stable and the dynamics are less easily understood. Many of the global commons are non-renewable on human time scales. Thus, resource degradation is more likely to be the result of [[unintended consequences]] that are unforeseen, not immediately observable, or not easily understood. For example, the [[carbon dioxide emissions]] that drive [[climate change]] continue to do so for at least a millennium after they enter the atmosphere&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Irreversible Climate Change Due to Carbon Dioxide Emissions. |author=Solomon, S. |journal=[[Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences]] |year=2009 |volume=106 |issue=6 |pages=1704–1709 |bibcode=2009PNAS..106.1704S |doi=10.1073/pnas.0812721106 |pmid=19179281 |pmc=2632717 |display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt; and species extinctions last forever.  Importantly, because there are significant differences in the benefits, costs, and interests at the global level, there are significant differences in [[externalities]] between more local resource uses and uses of global-level resources.

Several [[environmental protocol]]s have been established (see [[List of international environmental agreements]]) as a type of [[international law]], "an intergovernmental document intended as legally binding with a primary stated purpose of preventing or managing human impacts on natural resources."&lt;ref&gt;Kanie, Norichike (2007). "Governance with Multi-lateral Environmental Agreements: A healthy or ill-equipped fragmentation?" ''Global Environmental Governance: Perspectives on the Current Debate'', Walter Hoffmann and Lydia Swart (eds.): 67-86. New York: Center for UN Reform Education.&lt;/ref&gt; International environmental protocols came to feature in [[environmental governance]] after trans-boundary [[pollution|environmental problems]] became widely perceived in the 1960s.&lt;ref name="Haas"&gt;Haas, Keohane and Levy (1993). ''Institutions for the Earth: Sources of effective international environmental protection.'' Massachusetts Institute of Technology.&lt;/ref&gt;  Following the [[United Nations Conference on the Human Environment|Stockholm Intergovernmental Conference]] in 1972, creation of international environmental agreements proliferated.&lt;ref name="zurn"&gt;Zürn, Michael (1998). "The Rise of International Environmental Politics: A Review of Current Research."  ''World Politics'', 50(4):617-649.&lt;/ref&gt; Due to the barriers already discussed, environmental protocols are not a panacea for global commons issues.  Often, they are slow to produce the desired effects, tend to the [[lowest common denominator]], and lack monitoring and enforcement. They also take an incremental approach to solutions where [[sustainable development]] principles suggest that environmental concerns should be mainstream political issues.

===The global ocean===
{{Main article|World ocean|Water cycle}}

The global or [[world ocean]], as the interconnected system of the [[Earth]]'s [[ocean]]ic (or [[Marine (ocean)|marine]]) [[water]]s that comprise the bulk of the [[hydrosphere]], is a classic global commons.  It is divided into a number of principal oceanic areas that are delimited by the [[continent]]s and various oceanographic features.  In turn, oceanic waters are interspersed by many smaller seas, gulfs, and bays.  Further, most freshwater bodies ultimately empty into the ocean and are derived through the Earth's [[water cycle]] from ocean waters.  The [[United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea|Law of the Sea]] is a body of [[public international law]] governing relationships between nations in respect to navigational rights, [[mineral rights]], and jurisdiction over coastal waters.  Maritime law, also called [[Admiralty law]], is a body of both domestic law governing maritime activities and [[Conflict of laws|private international law]] governing the relationships between private entities which operate vessels on the oceans. It deals with matters including marine commerce, [[marine navigation]], [[shipping]], [[sailor]]s, and the transportation of passengers and goods by sea. However, these bodies of law do little to nothing to protect deep oceans from human threats.

In addition to providing significant means of transportation, a large proportion of all [[life]] on Earth exists in its ocean, which contains about 300 times the habitable volume of terrestrial habitats.  Specific marine habitats include [[coral reef]]s, [[kelp forest]]s, [[seagrass meadow]]s, [[tidepool]]s, muddy, sandy and rocky bottoms, and the open ocean ([[pelagic]]) zone, where solid objects are rare and the surface of the water is the only visible boundary. The organisms studied range from microscopic [[phytoplankton]] and [[zooplankton]] to huge [[cetaceans]] (whales) 30 [[meters]] (98 [[foot (length)|feet]]) in length.

At a fundamental level, marine life helps determine the very nature of our planet. Marine life resources provide food (especially [[fishery|food fish]]), medicines, and raw materials. It is also becoming understood that the well-being of marine organisms and other organisms are linked in very fundamental ways. The human body of knowledge regarding the relationship between life in the sea and important cycles is rapidly growing, with new discoveries being made nearly every day. These cycles include those of matter (such as the [[carbon cycle]]) and of air (such as [[Global climate model|Earth's respiration]], and movement of energy through [[ecosystem]]s including the ocean). Marine organisms contribute significantly to the [[oxygen cycle]], and are involved in the regulation of the Earth's [[climate]].&lt;ref name="DMS"&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://www.springerlink.com/content/hm3h1q666x206h46 |title=Planktonic dimethylsulfide and cloud albedo: An estimate of the feedback response |author=Foley, Jonathan A., Karl E.

The United Nations Environment Programme ([[UNEP]]) has identified several areas of need in managing the global ocean: strengthen national capacities for action, especially in developing countries; improve fisheries management;     reinforce cooperation in semi-enclosed and regional seas; strengthen controls over ocean disposal of hazardous and nuclear wastes; and advance the Law of the Sea. Specific problems identified as in need of attention include [[Current sea level rise|rising sea levels]]; [[Marine pollution|contamination]] by hazardours chemicals (including oil spills); microbiological contamination; ocean acidification; [[Algal bloom#Harmful algal blooms|harmful algal blooms]]; and [[over-fishing]] and other [[overexploitation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=http://www.unep.org/geo/geo4/report/10_Placing_Environment_at_the_Core.pdf |title=Global environment outlook: environment for development (GEO4) |publisher=World Commission on Environment and Development, The United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP). |authorlink=Section F,  Chapter 10: From the Periphery to the Core of Decision Making – Options for Action |year=2007 |isbn=978-9280728361}}&lt;/ref&gt; Further, the [[Pew Charitable Trusts]] Environmental Initiative program has identified a need for a worldwide system of very large, highly protected marine reserves where fishing and other extractive activities are prohibited.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.pewenvironment.org/campaigns/global-ocean-legacy/id/8589941025 |title=Global Ocean Legacy |publisher=Environmental Initiative, Pew Charitable Trusts |accessdate=1 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Atmosphere===
{{Main article|Air pollution|Climate change|Global warming}}

The atmosphere is a complex dynamic natural gaseous system that is essential to support life on planet Earth. A primary concern for management of the global atmosphere is [[air pollution]], the introduction into the [[Earth's atmosphere|atmosphere]] of [[chemical]]s, [[particulates]], or [[biomolecule|biological materials]] that cause discomfort, disease, or death to humans, damage other living organisms such as food crops, or damage the [[natural environment]] or [[built environment]]. [[Stratosphere|Stratospheric]] [[ozone depletion]] due to air pollution has long been recognized as a threat to human health as well as to the Earth's [[ecosystems]].

Pollution of breathable [[Air pollution|air]] is a central problem in the management of the global commons. Pollutants can be in the form of solid particles, liquid droplets, or gases and may be natural or man-made.  Although controversial and limited in scope by methods of enforcement, in several parts of the world the [[polluter pays principle]], which makes the [[Party (law)|party]] responsible for producing [[pollution]] responsible for paying for the damage done to the [[natural environment]], is accepted. It has strong support in most [[Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development]] (OECD) and [[European Community]] (EC) countries. It is also known as extended producer responsibility (EPR). EPR seeks to shift the responsibility dealing with waste from [[government]]s (and thus, [[taxpayer]]s and society at large) to the entities producing it. In effect, it attempts to internalise the cost of waste disposal into the cost of the product, theoretically resulting in producers improving the [[Waste management|waste profile]] of their products, decreasing waste and increasing possibilities for [[reuse]] and [[recycling]].

The 1979 [[Convention on Long-Range Transboundary Air Pollution]], or CLRTAP, is an early international effort to protect and gradually reduce and prevent air pollution. It is implemented by the European Monitoring and Evaluation Programme (EMEP), directed by the [[United Nations Economic Commission for Europe]] (UNECE).  The [[Montreal Protocol on Substances that Deplete the Ozone Layer]], or Montreal Protocol (a protocol to the [[Vienna Convention for the Protection of the Ozone Layer]]), is an international [[treaty]] designed to protect the [[ozone layer]] by phasing out the production of numerous substances believed to be responsible for [[ozone depletion]]. The treaty was opened for signature on 16 September 1987, and entered into force on 1 January 1989.

[[Global dimming]] is the gradual reduction in the amount of global direct [[irradiance]] at the [[Earth]]'s surface, which has been observed for several decades after the start of systematic measurements in the 1950s. Global dimming is thought to have been caused by an increase in [[Atmospheric particulate matter|particulates]] such as [[sulfate aerosol]]s in the atmosphere due to human action.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ipcc.ch/pdf/assessment-report/ar4/wg1/ar4-wg1-chapter7.pdf |title=Couplings between changes in Climate System and the Biogeochemistry, 7.5.3 |author1=Keneth L. Denman |author2=Guy Brasseur |publisher=IPCC |year=2007 |accessdate=2008-04-09 |format=PDF |display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt; It has interfered with the  [[hydrological cycle]] by reducing evaporation and may have reduced rainfall in some areas. Global dimming also creates a [[global cooling|cooling]] effect that may have partially masked the effect of [[greenhouse gas]]es on [[global warming]].

Along with global warming, generalized [[climate change]] is an ongoing global commons concern.  Although global warming is now a generally accepted scientific observation, the precise causes of global warming are still a matter of research and debate. The [[Kyoto Protocol]] to the [[United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change]] (UNFCCC) is an international environmental treaty that sets binding obligations on industrialised countries to reduce emissions of greenhouse gases and prevent potentially harmful anthropogenic (i.e., human-induced) interference in the climate system.&lt;ref name="unfccc2005"&gt;{{cite web |title=Article 2 |work=The United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change. |quote=Such a level should be achieved within a time-frame sufficient to allow ecosystems to adapt naturally to climate change, to ensure that food production is not threatened and to enable economic development to proceed in a sustainable manner |url=http://unfccc.int/essential_background/convention/background/items/1353.php |accessdate=15 November 2005 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20051028023600/http://unfccc.int/essential_background/convention/background/items/1353.php |archivedate=28 October 2005 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; There are 192 parties to the convention, including 191 states and the [[European Union]], but not all have ratified and implemented the protocol.&lt;ref name=UNamend&gt;{{cite web |accessdate=21 January 2013 |work=United Nations |url=http://treaties.un.org/pages/ViewDetails.aspx?src=TREATY&amp;mtdsg_no=XXVII-7-c&amp;chapter=27&amp;lang=en |title=7.c Doha Amendment to the Kyoto Protocol |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131114190559/http://treaties.un.org/pages/ViewDetails.aspx?src=TREATY&amp;mtdsg_no=XXVII-7-c&amp;chapter=27&amp;lang=en |archivedate=14 November 2013 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Polar regions===
{{Main article|Polar regions|Climate change in the Arctic|Antarctic cooling controversy}}

The eight Arctic nations  [[Canada]],  [[Denmark]] ( [[Greenland]] and the [[Faroe Islands]]),  [[Norway]], the [[United States]] ([[Alaska]]), [[Sweden]], [[Finland]],  [[Iceland]], and [[Russia]], are all members of the treaty organization, the [[Arctic Council]], as are organizations representing six [[Indigenous peoples|indigenous populations]]. The Council operates on consensus basis, mostly dealing with environmental treaties and not addressing boundary or resource disputes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.un.org/Depts/los/reference_files/chronological_lists_of_ratifications.htm |date=April 22, 2009 |accessdate=April 30, 2009 |title=Chronological lists of ratifications of, accessions and successions to the Convention and the related Agreements |publisher=United Nations Division for Ocean Affairs and the Law of the Sea |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090414043900/http://www.un.org/depts/los/reference_files/chronological_lists_of_ratifications.htm |archivedate=14 April 2009 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt; |deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Currently, the [[Antarctic Treaty]] and related agreements, collectively called the Antarctic Treaty System or ATS, regulate [[international relations]] with respect to [[Antarctica]], Earth's only continent without a native human population. The treaty, entering into force in 1961 and currently having 50 signatory nations, sets aside Antarctica as a scientific preserve, establishes freedom of scientific investigation and bans [[Military activity in the Antarctic|military activity on that continent]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://polarconservation.org/education/plonearticle.2005-12-28.3597747204 |title=Information about the Antarctic Treaty and how Antarctica is governed. |accessdate=February 6, 2011 |date=December 28, 2005 |publisher=Polar Conservation Organisation |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110308064504/http://www.polarconservation.org/education/plonearticle.2005-12-28.3597747204 |archivedate=March 8, 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Changes in ocean circulation appear responsible for the first exchanges of zooplankton between the North Pacific and North Atlantic regions in perhaps 800,000 years. These changes can allow the transmission of diseases from subarctic animals to Arctic ones, and vice versa, posing an additional threat to species already stressed by habitat loss and other impacts. Where these changes lead is not yet clear, but are likely to have far-reaching impacts on Arctic marine ecosystems.

===Outer space===
{{Main article|Outer space|Space law}}

Management of [[outer space]] global commons has been contentious since the successful launch of the [[Sputnik]] satellite by the former [[Soviet Union]] on 4 October 1957.  There is no clear boundary between [[Earth's atmosphere]] and space, although there are several standard boundary designations: one that deals with [[Orbital speed|orbital velocity]] (the [[Kármán line]]), one that depends on the velocity of charged particles in space, and some that are determined by human factors such as the height at which human blood begins to boil without a pressurized environment (the [[Armstrong line]]).

[[Space policy]] regarding a country's [[List of space agencies|civilian space program]], as well as its policy on both [[Militarisation of space|military use]] and [[Commercialization of space|commercial use]] of outer space, intersects with [[science policy]], since national space programs often perform or [[Funding of science|fund research]] in [[space science]], and also with [[defense policy]], for applications such as [[spy satellite]]s and [[anti-satellite weapon]]s.  It also encompasses government regulation of third-party activities such as commercial [[communications satellite]]s and [[private spaceflight]]&lt;ref name=Goldman&gt;{{cite book |last=Goldman |first=Nathan C. |title=Space Policy:An Introduction |year=1992 |publisher=Iowa State University Press |location=Ames, IA |isbn=0-8138-1024-8 |page=vii}}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as the creation and application of [[space law]] and [[space advocacy]] organizations that exist to support the cause of space exploration.

The [[Outer Space Treaty]] provides a basic framework for international space law. It covers the legal use of outer space by nation states. The treaty states that outer space is free for all nation states to explore and is not subject to claims of national [[sovereignty]]. It also prohibits the deployment of [[nuclear weapon]]s in outer space. The treaty was passed by the [[United Nations General Assembly]] in 1963 and signed in 1967 by the USSR, the United States of America and the United Kingdom. As of mid-year, 2013 the treaty has been ratified by 102 states and signed by an additional 27 states.

Beginning in 1958, outer space has been the subject of multiple resolutions by the United Nations General Assembly. Of these, more than 50 have concerned the international co-operation in the peaceful uses of outer space and preventing an arms race in space. Four additional [[space law]] treaties have been negotiated and drafted by the UN's [[United Nations Committee on the Peaceful Uses of Outer Space|Committee on the Peaceful Uses of Outer Space]]. Still, there remain no legal prohibitions against deploying conventional weapons in space and [[anti-satellite weapon]]s have been successfully tested by the US, USSR and China. The 1979 [[Moon Treaty]] turned the jurisdiction of all heavenly bodies (including the orbits around such bodies) over to the international community. However, this treaty has not been ratified by any nation that currently practices manned spaceflight.

In 1976 eight equatorial states ([[Ecuador]], [[Colombia]], [[Brazil]], [[Republic of Congo|Congo]], [[Democratic Republic of Congo|Zaire]], [[Uganda]], [[Kenya]], and [[Indonesia]]) met in [[Bogotá]], Colombia to make the "Declaration of the First Meeting of Equatorial Countries," also known as "the Bogotá Declaration", a claim to control the segment of the geosynchronous orbital path corresponding to each country. These claims are not internationally accepted.

The [[International Space Station program]]me is a joint project among five participating space agencies: [[NASA]], the [[Russian Federal Space Agency]] (RSA), [[Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency]] (JAXA), [[European Space Agency]] (ESA), and [[Canadian Space Agency]] (CSA). National budget constraints led to the merger of three space station projects into the [[International Space Station]]. In 1993 the partially built components for a Soviet/Russian space station [[Mir-2]], the proposed American [[Space Station Freedom|Freedom]], and the proposed European [[Columbus (ISS module)|Columbus]] merged into this multinational programme.&lt;ref name="ISSBook"&gt;{{cite book |isbn=978-0387781440 |date=17 June 2008 |publisher=Springer-Praxis |author=John E. Catchpole |title=The International Space Station: Building for the Future}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ownership and use of the space station is established by intergovernmental treaties and agreements.

According to the original Memorandum of Understanding between NASA and the RSA, the International Space Station was intended to be a laboratory, observatory and factory in space. It was also planned to provide transportation, maintenance, and act as a staging base for possible future missions to the Moon, Mars and asteroids. In the 2010 United States National Space Policy, it was given additional roles of serving commercial, diplomatic&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Payette |first=Julie |title=Research and Diplomacy 350 Kilometers above the Earth: Lessons from the International Space Station |journal=Science &amp; Diplomacy |date=10 December 2012 |volume=1 |issue=4 |url=http://www.sciencediplomacy.org/article/2012/research-and-diplomacy-350-kilometers-above-earth}}&lt;/ref&gt;  and educational purposes.&lt;ref name=USNSP&gt;{{cite web |title=National Space Policy of the United States of America |url=http://www.whitehouse.gov/sites/default/files/national_space_policy_6-28-10.pdf |publisher=White House; USA Federal government |accessdate=20 July 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110711205103/http://www.whitehouse.gov/sites/default/files/national_space_policy_6-28-10.pdf |archivedate=11 July 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Internet===
{{Main article|Digital commons (economics)}}

As a global system of [[computer]]s interconnected by [[telecommunication]] technologies consisting of millions of private, public, academic, business, and government resources, it is difficult to argue that the [[Internet]] is a global commons.  These computing resources are largely privately owned and subject to [[private property]] law, although many are government owned and subject to [[public law]]. The [[World Wide Web]], as a system of interlinked [[hypertext]] documents, either [[public domain]] (like Wikipedia itself) or subject to [[copyright law]], is, at best, a mixed [[good (economics)|good]].

The resultant [[Virtuality|virtual]] space or [[cyberspace]], however, is often viewed as an electronic global commons that allows for as much or more [[freedom of expression]] as any [[public space]]. Access to those [[Digital commons (economics)|digital commons]] and the actual freedom of expression allowed does vary widely by geographical area.  Management of the electronic global commons presents as many issues as do other commons.  In addition to issues related to [[digital divide|inequity in access]], issues such as [[net neutrality]], [[Internet censorship]], [[Internet privacy]], and electronic [[surveillance]] arise.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The Governance of Cyberspace: Politics, Technology and Global Restructuring |publisher=Routledge |author=Loader, Brian D |year=2004 |isbn=978-0415147248}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Félix Nadar 1820-1910 portraits Edmond et Jules Goncourt.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Edmond (left) with his brother Jules. Photographed by [[Félix Nadar]]]]

The '''Goncourt brothers''' ({{IPA-fr|ɡɔ̃kuːʁ|lang}}) were [[Edmond de Goncourt]] ({{IPA-fr|ɛdmɔ̃|}}, 1822–96) and [[Jules de Goncourt]] ({{IPA-fr|ʒyl|}}, 1830–70), both [[France|French]] [[Naturalism (literature)|naturalism]] writers who, as collaborative sibling authors, were inseparable in life.

==Partnership==
They formed a partnership that "is possibly unique in literary history. Not only did they write all their books together, they did not spend more than a day apart in their adult lives, until they were finally parted by Jules's death in 1870."&lt;ref&gt;Kirsch (2006)&lt;/ref&gt; They are known for their literary work and for their diaries, which offer an intimate view into the French literary society of the later 19th century.

==Career==
Their career as writers began with an account of a sketching holiday together. They then published books on aspects of 18th-century French and Japanese art and society. Their histories (''Portraits intimes du XVIIIe siècle'' (1857), ''La Femme au XVIIIe siècle'' (1862), ''La du Barry'' (1878), and others) are made entirely out of documents, autograph letters, scraps of costume, engravings, songs, the unconscious self-revelations of the time.&lt;ref name="EB1911"&gt;{{EB1911|inline=1|wstitle=Goncourt, De|volume=7|page=231}}&lt;/ref&gt; In their volumes (e.g., ''Portraits intimes du XVIII siecle''), they dismissed the vulgarity of the [[Second French Empire|Second Empire]] in favour of a more refined age. They wrote the long ''[[Goncourt Journal|Journal des Goncourt]]'' from 1851, which gives a view of the literary and social life of their time.

When they came to write novels, it was with a similar attempt to give the inner, undiscovered, minute truths of contemporary existence.&lt;ref name="EB1911"/&gt; They published six novels, of which ''[[Germinie Lacerteux]]'', 1865, was the fourth. It is based on the true case of their own maidservant, Rose Malingre, whose [[double life]] they had never suspected. After the death of Jules, Edmond continued to write novels in the same style.

According to the [[Encyclopædia Britannica Eleventh Edition]]:
{{quote|[T]hey invented a new kind of novel, and their novels are the result of a new vision of the world, in which the very element of sight is decomposed, as in a picture of Monet. Seen through the nerves, in this conscious abandonment to the tricks of the eyesight, the world becomes a thing of broken patterns and conflicting colours, and uneasy movement. A novel of the Goncourts is made up of an infinite number of details, set side by side, every detail equally prominent. While a novel of Flaubert, for all its detail, gives above all things an impression of unity, a novel of the Goncourts deliberately dispenses with unity in order to give the sense of the passing of life, the heat and form of its moments as they pass. It is written in little chapters, sometimes no longer than a page, and each chapter is a separate notation of some significant event, some emotion or sensation which seems to throw sudden light on the picture of a soul. To the Goncourts humanity is as pictorial a thing as the world it moves in; they do not search further than "the physical basis of life," and they find everything that can be known of that unknown force written visibly upon the sudden faces of little incidents, little expressive moments. The soul, to them, is a series of moods, which succeed one another, certainly without any of the too arbitrary logic of the novelist who has conceived of character as a solid or consistent thing. Their novels are hardly stories at all, but picture-galleries, hung with pictures of the momentary aspects of the world.}}

They are buried together (in the same grave) in [[Montmartre Cemetery]].

==Legacy==
Edmond de Goncourt bequeathed his entire estate for the foundation and maintenance of the [[Académie Goncourt]]. Since 1903, the académie has awarded the [[Prix Goncourt]], probably the most important literary prize in [[French literature]].

The first English translation of ''Manette Salomon'', translated by [[Tina Kover]], was published in November 2017 by [[Snuggly Books]].

[[File:LandnamabokManuscriptPage.jpg|thumb|upright=0.9|right|A page from the [[Landnámabók]]]]
The '''history of the Icelandic language''' began in the 9th century when the [[settlement of Iceland]], mostly by [[Norway|Norwegians]], brought a dialect of [[Old Norse]] to the island.

The oldest preserved texts in Icelandic were written around 1100, the oldest single text being Islendingabok followed by Landnamabok. Some of the poetry, such as the Eddas, that were written down a little later nevertheless contain older language because poetic language was kept in memory unchanged over sometimes a remarkably long time. The most famous of these, written in Iceland from the 12th century onward, are without doubt the [[Icelandic Sagas]], the historical writings of [[Snorri Sturluson]]; and [[eddaic poems]].

The language of the era of the [[saga]]s is called Old Icelandic, a dialect of (Western) [[Old Norse]], the common Scandinavian language of the [[Viking era]]. The [[History of Iceland|Danish rule of Iceland]] from 1380 to 1918 had little effect on the evolution of Icelandic, which remained in daily use among the general population: Danish was not used for official communications. The same applied to English during the [[United Kingdom|British]] (and later [[United States|American]]) [[Invasion of Iceland|occupation]] of Iceland during [[World War II]].

Though Icelandic is considered more [[Conservative (language)|archaic]] than other living Germanic languages, especially in its [[Morphology (linguistics)|morphology]] and other grammatical aspects, as well as in its [[lexicon]], the language has nevertheless been subject to some important changes. The pronunciation, for instance, changed considerably between the 12th and 16th centuries, especially that of vowels.

Nevertheless, written Icelandic has changed relatively little since the 13th century. As a result of this, and of the similarity between the modern and ancient grammar, modern speakers can still understand, more or less, the original [[Icelandic sagas|sagas]] and [[Edda]]s that were written some 800 years ago. This ability is sometimes mildly overstated by Icelanders themselves, most of whom actually read the Sagas with updated modern spelling and footnotes—though otherwise intact.

==The language of the Norwegian settlers==
Most of the [[Settlement of Iceland|original settlers]] of [[Iceland]] came from [[Western Norway]], bringing with them the western [[dialect]] of Old Norse. Due to its geographic isolation and consequent lack of influence from other [[Stratum (linguistics)|stratum]] languages, the development of the language was entirely independent. However, it would be wrong to suggest that the language that was brought to Iceland was completely homogeneous; even though most of the settlers were from western Norway, there were a number from other parts of the country and also from other [[Scandinavian countries]]. Therefore the language that grew up in Iceland was influenced by all of the [[Norwegian language|Norwegian]] dialects of the time. The close intermingling of the people of the island, especially at the ''[[Alþingi]]'' (the general meeting that took place at the beginning of each summer at ''[[Þingvellir]]'') contributed to even out the differences between the various dialects: traits common to all dialects were reinforced, while the most marked differences gradually disappeared. Although it is not known exactly how the language developed, modern Icelandic has evolved less than other [[Scandinavian languages]]. The unique development of Icelandic, which eventually resulted in its complete separation from Norwegian and the other Scandinavian languages, began with the ''landnám'' or first settlement. Icelandic has lost all trace of the tonal nature of early Scandinavian languages, traces of which are noticeable in modern Norwegian and especially [[Swedish language|Swedish]]. Research has been carried out to identify certain traits of the language, for example the so-called ''preaspiration'', but the results were inconclusive. Icelandic shares such characteristics with two other languages: [[Faroese language|Faroese]] and the [[Finland Swedish|Swedish]] spoken in [[Finland]].

==The Scandinavian period (550–1050)==
The period from 550 to 1050 is called the Scandinavian or 'Common Nordic' period. During this time, a notably unified common language was spoken throughout Scandinavia. The key position of [[Denmark]] as the focal point of the whole area meant that the language was often simply called 'Danish' (''dǫnsk tunga'').&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Anderson|first=Carl Edlund|title=The Danish Tongue and Scandinavian Identity|url=https://www.academia.edu/1659454/The_Danish_Tongue_and_Scandinavian_Identity|accessdate=4 November 2013|page=1|format=PDF|quote=Icelandic writers (who provide the bulk of our surviving documentation)commonly employed the term dǫnsk tunga (literally "Danish tongue") to identify the language not just of those who were ruled by the Dana konungr, but of all Germanic-speaking Scandinavians.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Even though the first hints of individual future developments were already identifiable in different parts of the vast region, there were no problems with [[mutual intelligibility]].

With regard to the ''dǫnsk tunga'' spoken in Iceland, there are no written documents from this period. Ancient Scandinavian [[runes]] were certainly widely known but were never used to write on [[papyrus]] (except [[Codex Runicus]]). They were designed as a sacred [[alphabet]] to be engraved into stone, metal or wood. In Iceland few runic inscriptions have been found and nearly all are dated after 1200.

==Ancient Scandinavian or Norse (1050–1350)==
{{See also|Old Norse}}
The period from 1050 to 1350 is known as ''Old Scandinavian'', ''Old Nordic'' or ''Norse''. There are numerous [[manuscript]]s and documents dating from this period, which allows researchers to characterize Icelandic from this period accurately. 

All of the documents use the Latin alphabet, which was introduced to Iceland in the 12th century. Laws were transcribed onto [[vellum]] for the first time in 1117–1118. The first manuscripts among those still in our possession date back to the second half of the 12th century. Sometime on the later half of the 12. century the [[First Grammatical Treatise]] (''Fyrsta Málfrœðiritgerðin'') was composed, a highly original description of the language unique in Europe at the time. The treatise was concerned with the sounds of the language; it described the internal workings of the [[Icelandic phonology|phonological system]] in much the same way as modern [[Linguistics|linguistic]] methodology. The manuscript, today kept in [[Reykjavík]] at the ''Handritastofnun Íslands'' ('Manuscript Institute of Iceland') is a later copy of the original text. Three other grammatical treaties were composed in the following decades.

Although the oldest manuscripts date back to around 1150, they show structures that were in use from around 900. This is particularly true of the ancient [[epic poetry]], which, due to its metric structure and oral tradition, conserved notably archaic forms. Between 1050 and 1350 Icelandic began to develop independently from other [[Scandinavian languages|Scandinavian]] and [[Germanic languages]]; it is particularly conservative in its [[inflectional morphology]] and notably homogeneous across the country. From the manuscripts it has not been possible to determine whether [[dialect]]s ever existed in Iceland; all indications suggest that from the outset the language has maintained an extraordinary level of homogeneity.

Around 1300, the Danish language saw a very rapid evolution in both its [[phonology]] and its [[Morphology (linguistics)|morphology]]. Given that changes to a spoken language are often only recorded later in the written language, it is probable that in spoken Danish these changes occurred around 1250 and perhaps even earlier. The rapid evolution of Danish (a simplification comparable to that seen between [[Old English]] and [[Middle English]]) gave rise to a marked difference between the north and south of [[Scandinavia]]. In 1350 Danish assumed characteristics that are still seen in the language today.

[[Norwegian language|Norwegian]] and [[Swedish language|Swedish]] developed more slowly, but show equally notable differences from Icelandic, which is always more conservative and has maintained even to this day many common Scandinavian features.

In Norwegian a kind of vocalic harmony developed, in which a syllable after a stressed syllable with a [[high vowel]] ({{IPA|[i], [u]}}) exhibited only a high vowel (''systir'' 'sister', cf. Icelandic ''systir''), while a syllable after a stressed syllable with a [[mid vowel]] ({{IPA|[e], [o]}}) showed only a [[mid vowel]] (''broþer'' "brother", cf. Icelandic ''bróðir''). Such innovation was only accepted in eastern Norwegian and in Swedish (Mod. Norwegian, Swedish ''bro[de]r''), while in Icelandic there is no trace of it.

With regard to [[consonant]]s, Continental Scandinavian languages and most other Germanic languages lost the series of [[fricative]]s {{IPA|/θ, ð/}}, which were retained only in Icelandic and English (which shows here a notably archaic phonological trait). They were replaced with the corresponding [[Dental consonant|dentals]] {{IPA|/t, d/}} ( Norwegian, Swedish ''tung'' "heavy" ''smed'' "smith", cf Icelandic ''þungr'', ''smiðr'' (modern Icelandic ''þungur'', ''smiður'').

Icelandic is the only Germanic language to have conserved the word-initial consonant sequences {{angbr|hl, hr, hn}}, at least from a graphic point of view (their pronunciation is in part modified by the desonoration of the second consonantal element): Icelandic ''hljóð'', ''hrafn'', ''hneta'', cf English ''loud'', ''raven'', ''nut'', Swedish ''ljud'', ''ramn'' ([[Toponymy|toponymic]] only), ''nöt'', [[German language|German]] ''Laut'', ''Rabe'', ''Nuss''.

Again along with English, Icelandic is unusual among Germanic languages to have conserved, if only at a local level, the pronunciation {{IPA|[xw]}} of the word-initial consonantal cluster {{angbr|hv}}: Icelandic ''hvað'', ''hvalur'' {{IPA|[ˈxwaːð, ˈxwaːlʏr]}}, more commonly {{IPA|[ˈkʰvað, ˈkʰvaːlʏr]}}. In English ''what'', ''whale'', the {{angbr|h}} is only pronounced in certain dialects. The other Germanic languages have [[consonant]]ized the cluster: German ''was'', ''Wal-fisch'' {{IPA|[v-]}}, [[Dutch language|Dutch]] ''wat'', ''wal-vis'', Swedish ''vad'', ''val[fisk]''. Until the early years of the 20th century Swedish maintained the orthography in words such as ''hvad, hvalfisk'', which is purely historical. In Danish one writes but does not pronounce {{IPA|[hv-]}}: ''hvad'', ''hval-fisk'' {{IPA|[ˈvæːð, ˈvælfisɡ̊]}}, while in [[Norwegian language|Nynorsk]], in some cases, one writes and pronounces {{IPA|[kv-]}} (''kva''), exactly as is usual in modern Icelandic (southern dialect and literary). There are also indications that {{angbr|h}} was originally pronounced {{IPA|[x]}}.

An important vocalic development, also from a morphological standpoint, was the disappearance of word-final ''-r'' with the addition of [[epenthesis|epenthetic]] {{IPA|/ʏ/}}, written as {{angbr|u}}: Old Icelandic ''akr, gestr, merkr, þú gefr'' became Modern Icelandic ''ak'''u'''r, gest'''u'''r, merk'''u'''r, þú gef'''u'''r''.

In the old language the verbs forming past tense with the dental suffix (corresponding to -d in english) were apart in 1. &amp; 3. person, ending with -a in 1. person but -i in 3. person. The 1. person took the form of the 3. person and are now identical. This is the only alteration in person inflection from the old language, here in stark contrast to the other scandinavian languages where they vanished completely and halfed in Faroese.

==Middle Icelandic (1350–1550)==
The current spelling of the language is unchanged from about 1300. In discussing the development of the language it is usually most convenient to divide it into two sections where the changes prior to the current spelling are outlined in the former and later changes in another. In the period from 1350 to 1550, coinciding with the total loss of independence and Danish rule, the difference between Norwegian and Icelandic grew even larger. Norway also fell to the Danish Crown, and Danish became its [[official language]], which led to the formation of a hybrid Dano-Norwegian language, the basis of the modern [[Bokmål]] (successfully "re-Norwegianized" only in the 20th century). Only in western [[Norway]] (whence came the original settlers of Iceland) were the [[dialect]]s kept relatively pure and free from Danish influence, so much so that in the second half of the 19th century the linguist [[Ivar Aasen]] created an authentic Norwegian idiom on the basis of them, first called ''[[landsmål]]'' "national language" and later ''[[nynorsk]]'' or "neo-Norwegian", which obtained immediate recognition as an [[official language]] of the state and is now particularly used in Western Norway. All the continental Scandinavian languages evolved in this period from more [[synthetic language|synthetic]] to more [[analytic language|analytic]] languages, and with the [[Protestant Reformation|Reformation]] begin to assume a modern character. However Icelandic in this period shows a [[dichotomy]]. On the one hand it retained, practically unaltered, its rich inflectional morphology; on the other it underwent a phonological reorganization comparable in its scope to the development from [[Middle English]] to [[Modern English]]. To cite only the most important changes:

* In the vowel system the long vowels {{IPA|/aː, eː, ɛː, oː/}} became diphthongs, and the [[vowel#Articulation|quality]] of {{IPA|/iː, uː/}} changed. In the 14- &amp; 1500's the vowels {{IPA|/y, yː/}} lost their [[Vowel#Roundedness|rounding]] and merged with {{IPA|/i, iː/}}. New [[diphthong]]s were formed, often under the influence of preceding or following consonants and, in general, the pronunciation of [[short vowel]]s became less tense: they are now very lax.{{clarify|reason=Laxness often involves place of articulation: does this mean that the short vowels became opener or closer?|date=July 2017}} Orthography changed: the letters {{angbr|ǿ}} and {{angbr|ǫ}} were replaced by {{angbr|æ}} and {{angbr|ö}}: Old Icelandic ''bøkr, lǫndom'' became Modern Icelandic ''bækur, löndum''. The vowel letter {{angbr|o}} in many morphemes (probably already pronounced {{IPA|[ʏ]}} in the early period) changed to {{angbr|u}}: ''londom, vér gefom, þeir ero'' &gt; ''löndum, við gefum, þeir eru''. However the pronunciation of unaccented vowels remained very clear, compared to what happened in the other Scandinavian and Germanic languages, a factor that played an important role in the conservation of some forms.
The digraph -''au'' which in the old language signified the same thing it does in Spanish &amp; German (as ow in how) changed to -öí similar tu germau -eu (oi) but -ö in stead of -o.
* The consonant system underwent even more profound transformations. Phenomena such as [[Palatalization (sound change)|palatalization]] appeared through contact, forming consonant phonemes that were probably previously absent. The most obvious change was the formation of unvoiced consonants: [[unvoiced]] consonants became [[Aspiration (phonetics)|aspirated]], while voiced consonants lost their vibration while retaining their articulation. Another very notable phenomenon is ''preaspiration'', in which certain consonant clusters are preceded by a complete closure of the [[vocal cords]] followed a light aspiration. Other consonant clusters developed an unvoiced dental element ([[Pre-stopped consonant|prestopping]]). Neither phenomenon is written, which reflects the fact that they are (still) merely phonetic (i. e., are not used to distinguish meanings) and have not (yet) become phonological (but this is a common phenomenon in many languages of cultures like English, [[French language|French]] and Danish). Morphophonetic phenomena have also developed, some of them denoted by the graphemes (''gef þú'' &gt; ''gefðu'' etc.)

Despite this phonetic 'earthquake', some very ancient and fundamental characteristics were retained, like the conservation of word-final unaccented vowels {{IPA|[i, u, a]}}, elsewhere reduced to an indistinct schwa {{IPA|[ə]}}; as stated, this is probably the principal cause of the morphological conservation.

==Modern Icelandic==
{{See also|Icelandic language}}
Around 1550, with the [[Lutheran Reformation]], the introduction of printing and the consequent translation of [[the Bible]], modern Icelandic was definitively formed. Compared to other Scandinavian and Germanic languages (with the partial exception of [[Faroese language|Faroese]] and [[German language|German]]), Icelandic certainly remained at an earlier evolutionary stage in terms of its morphology, but this should not imply that the language did not change; the phonological developments of the language from the ancient to the modern language are enormous. A conservative writing system, rich [[inflectional morphology]] and a [[lexicon]] that is resistant to [[loanword]]s (instead preferring [[neologism]]s formed from native material) obscures the true nature of modern Icelandic, which is a modern language like any other; [[Russian language|Russian]], [[Polish language|Polish]] and [[Hungarian language|Hungarian]], as examples, have a morphological system at least as complex as that of Icelandic, and Hungarian, moreover, behaves exactly like Icelandic in terms of its acceptance of most loanwords. As is often said of [[Icelanders|Icelandic people]], they have no difficulty in reading works of medieval literature, but to speak to their ancestors they would probably need an interpreter. The most consistent changes have been that to the vowel system, which followed the segmental phonological quantity in the 16th century or perhaps as early as the 14th century, and the consequent development of [[diphthong]]s. In the consonant system there have also been notable changes, for example the desonorization of [[plosives]], the rise of a correlative [[sonorant]] for [[Nasal stop|nasals]] and [[Liquid consonant|liquids]] ([[Pre-stopped consonant|pre-stopping]]) and [[preaspiration]].

The modern [[Icelandic orthography|Icelandic alphabet]] has developed from a standard established in the 19th century primarily by the Danish linguist [[Rasmus Rask]]. It is ultimately based heavily on an orthographic standard created in the early 12th century in a mysterious document known as The ''[[First Grammatical Treatise]]'' by an anonymous author who has later been referred to as the 'First Grammarian'. The later Rasmus Rask standard was basically a re-enactment of the old treatise, with some changes to fit concurrent [[Germanic languages|Germanic]] conventions, such as the exclusive use of ''k'' rather than ''c''. Various old features, like ''ð'', had actually not seen much use in the later centuries, so Rask’s standard constituted a major change in practice. Later 20th century changes include most notably the adoption of ''é'', which had previously been written as ''je'' (reflecting the modern pronunciation), and the abolition of ''z'' in 1973.

===Linguistic purism===
{{Main| Linguistic purism in Icelandic}}
During the 18th century, the Icelandic authorities implemented a stringent policy of [[linguistic purism]]. Under this policy, some writers and terminologists were put in charge of the creation of new vocabulary to adapt the Icelandic language to the evolution of new concepts, without resorting to borrowed [[neologism]]s as in many other languages. A few old words that had fallen into disuse were updated to fit in with the modern language, and neologisms were created from Old Norse roots. For example, the word ''rafmagn'' ("electricity") literally means "amber power" – a [[calque]] of the Greek ''elektron'' ("[[amber]]"); similarly the word ''sími'' ("telephone") originally meant "wire", and ''tölva'' ("computer") combines ''tala'' ("digit"; "number") and ''völva'' ("female fortuneteller").

==Foreign influences on Icelandic==

===Toponyms===
{{See also|Street names in Iceland|Icelandic exonyms}}
Even though the vast majority of Icelandic [[toponym]]s are native and clearly interpretable (for example ''[[Ísafjörður|Ísa-fjörður]]'' "ice fjord", ''[[Flatey (disambiguation)|Flat-ey]]'' "flat island", ''[[Gullfoss|Gull-foss]]'' "golden waterfall", ''[[Vatnajökull|Vatna-jökull]]'' "water glacier", ''[[Reykjavík|Reykja-vík]]'' "bay of smoke", ''[[Blanda]]'' "the mixed (river)" (which is formed by the confluence of different rivers), ''[[Varmá|Varm-á]]'' "hot river") there are some that up to now have resisted any plausible interpretation, even in the light of the Celtic languages. For example, ''[[Esja]]'' (a mountain on Kjalarnes), ''Ferstikla'' (a farm near [[Hvalfjörður]]), ''Vigur'' (an island in [[Ísafjarðardjúp]]), ''Ölfus'' (an area of [[Árnessýsla]], traversed by the river [[Hvíta-Ölfusá]]), ''Tintron'' (a volcanic crater in [[Lyngdalsheiði]]), ''Kjós'' (the area that gives its name to [[Kjósarsýsla]]), ''Bóla'' (a farm in [[Skagarfjörður]]) and ''[[Hekla]]'' (the most famous Icelandic volcano). Such toponyms pose numerous problems, but the main one can be stated in a very simple question: if they are neither Icelandic nor Celtic, which language do they come from? Perhaps they have been taken from a language (or languages) of unknown ethnicity, or perhaps (and this is a fascinating though highly improbably hypothesis) these names are a sign that Iceland was already inhabited not only before the ''landnám'', but even preceding the arrival of the first Irish hermits. But who were these people? Some scholars, such as [[Árni Óla]], have concerned themselves with the question, attempting to demonstrate this hypothesis, which would force a complete rewrite of Icelandic history. Others have asserted that since Icelandic is an imported language, such names could in reality be traced back to some unknown substrate of Norwegian (comparisons have consequently been made with [[Northern Sami]] and other [[Uralic languages]]), and have therefore been transplanted to the island by colonists who originated from parts of Norway where such substrate languages would have still been present. Naturally, there have been numerous attempts to explain the names in terms of Icelandic: ''Kjós'', for example, could come from the root of the verb ''kjósa'', and therefore mean "the chosen land"; moreover, there is also the common Norwegian surname ''Kjus''. ''Bóla'' could be simply ''ból'' "dwelling, habitation", from the root of the verb ''búa'' "inhabit", present in many names of farms such as ''Aðal-ból'' "main farm".

===Danish influence===
The efforts of the government in [[Copenhagen]] to make Danish the official language of [[Iceland]] have left in their wake many Danish terms in official documents, but they have little lasting success. The rural population remained faithful to their own ancestral language, while Danish borrowings were used only by a restricted class of ageing educated people who were heavily influenced by Danish culture and lived only in [[Reykjavík]]. So when the battle for the purification of Icelandic from all Danicisms began in the 19th century, the groundwork had already been laid. The purification campaign was such a success that Danish borrowings were almost completely eliminated. Only a few terms by now stable in the spoken and administrative language survive, like ''ske'' "happen" (cf. Danish ''ske'', corresponding to German ''ge-schehen''), ''fordæma'' "pass sentence", (cf. Danish ''fordømme''), the adverbs ''kannske'' (more commonly ''kannski'') and ''máske'' "perhaps, maybe" (cf. Danish ''kanske, måske'', lit. "can happen") and some nouns like ''blýantur'' "pencil, crayon", ''fangelsi'' "prison" and ''frímerki'' "postage stamp" (cf. Danish ''blyant, fængsel, frimærke'').

===Keltic &amp; Gaellic influences===
These influences are very slight and most notable in simple names that have been comoner in Iceland than elsewhere in Scandinavia over the centuries, Njall - Niel, Brjann, Brian, Kaðlín - Kathleen, Patrekur - Patrik, Konall (as in O'Connel), Trostan - Tristan, Kormákur - Cormack.

===Influences of other languages===
Influences of other languages are relatively insignificant. Certainly, many terms of [[Latin language|Latin]] origin are present in Icelandic, but these date back to the common Germanic period and are present in all the other Germanic languages. For example ''[[wikt:kaupa|kaupa]]'' "to buy" &lt; Latin ''[[wikt:caupo|caupō]]'', ''pappír'' "paper" (German ''Papier'', English ''paper'' &lt; Latin ''papyrus'') and ''keisari'' "emperor" (German ''Kaiser'', Swedish ''kejsare'' &lt; Latin ''Cæsar'').

Latin borrowings dating back to the introduction of [[Christianity]] include ''kredda'' "creed, dogma" (&lt; Latin ''credo'') and ''predika'' "prophesy, preach" (&lt; Latin ''prædicare''; cf. German ''predigen''); more recently the very common ''náttúra'' "nature", ''persóna'' "person" (originally [[Etruscan language|Etruscan]], one of the few remaining words in use of that language) and ''partur'' "part". With regard to modern languages, Icelandic has been influenced (in recent times quite heavily) only by English, particularly in the technical lexis and by the younger generation. In languages such as Italian, English words are simply borrowed just as they are; in contrast, in Icelandic they are adapted to the local phonetic and morphological system. For example, ''pönkarar'' and ''rokkarar'' ("[[punk rock]]ers" and just plain "[[Rock music|rock]]ers") who play ''á parketi diskótekanna'' "on the parquet of the discothèques".

The {{lang|fr|'''Institut de France'''|italic=no}} ({{IPA-fr|ɛ̃stity də fʁɑ̃s}}, Institute of France) is a [[France|French]] [[learned society]], grouping five {{lang|fr|académies}}, the most{{Citation needed|date=September 2018}} famous of which is the [[Académie française]].

The Institute, located in [[Paris]], manages approximately 1,000 foundations, as well as [[museum]]s and [[château]]x open for visit. It also awards prizes and subsidies, which amounted to a total of over [[euro|€]]5&amp;nbsp;million for 2002.{{citation needed|date=April 2013}} Most of these prizes are awarded by the Institute on the recommendation of the {{lang|fr|académies}}.

==History==

[[Image:Coupole del'Institut de France.jpg|right|thumb|Cupola of the Institut de France]]
[[File:Institut de France 1898.jpg|right|thumb|Esplanade in front of the Institut, 1898]]

The building was originally constructed as the [[Collège des Quatre-Nations]] by [[Cardinal Mazarin]], as a school for students from new provinces attached to France under Louis XIV. 

The Institut de France was established on 25 October 1795, by the French government.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.lonelyplanet.com/france/paris/attractions/institut-de-france/a/poi-sig/372633/359279|title=Institut de France in Paris, France|last=Planet|first=Lonely|work=Lonely Planet|access-date=2017-12-18|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2017, Xavier Darcos was named the Institut de France's chancellor.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.lefigaro.fr/culture/2017/12/12/03004-20171212ARTFIG00230-xavier-darcos-devient-chancelier-de-l-institut-de-france.php|title=Xavier Darcos devient chancelier de l'Institut de France|date=2017-12-12|work=FIGARO|access-date=2017-12-18|language=fr-FR}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Académies==
[[Image:TourDeNesleInstitut.jpg|right|thumb|A plaque on the northern wall of the Institut de France shows the ancient location of the [[Tour de Nesle]]]]
* [[Académie française]] (French Academy, concerning the French language) – initiated 1635, suppressed 1793, restored 1803 as a division of the institute.
* [[Académie des inscriptions et belles-lettres]] (Academy of Humanities) – initiated 1663.
* [[Académie des sciences]] (Academy of Sciences) – initiated 1666.
* [[Académie des beaux-arts]] (Academy of Fine Arts) – created 1816 as the merger of the 
** [[Académie de peinture et de sculpture]] (Academy of Painting and Sculpture, initiated 1648)
** [[Académie de musique]] (Academy of Music, initiated 1669) and
** [[Académie royale d'architecture|Académie d'architecture]] (Academy of Architecture, initiated 1671)
* [[Académie des sciences morales et politiques]] (Academy of Moral and Political Sciences) – initiated 1795, suppressed 1803, reestablished 1832.

==Influence==
The [[Royal Society of Canada]], initiated 1882, was modeled after the Institut de France and the [[Royal Society]] of London.

The [[Lebanese Academy of Sciences]], known officially by its French name "Académie des Sciences du Liban" (ASL), is broadly fashioned after the French Academy of Sciences, with which it continues to develop joint programs.

'''''Kushari''''', also '''''koshari''''' ({{lang-arz|كشرى}}, {{IPA-arz|ˈkoʃæɾi|}}), is an [[Egyptian cuisine|Egyptian dish]] originally made in the 19th century, made of [[rice]], [[macaroni]], and [[lentil]]s mixed together, topped with a spiced tomato sauce and garlic vinegar, and garnished with [[chickpea]]s and crispy [[fried onion]]s. Sprinklings of [[garlic]] juice, garlic vinegar, and hot sauce are optional.

==History==
''Kushari'' originated in the mid-19th century, during a time when Egypt was a multicultural country in the middle of an [[economic boom]]. It was invented as a [[vegetarian|vegetarian food]], and it consists of Egyptian fried onions, lentils, rice, and macaroni. It is very similar to the [[Indian dish]] made from rice and lentils, ''[[khichdi]]''. Some believe it was transferred to Egypt through soldiers of the British army during the colonization of both countries. Over time, the dish has evolved through Egyptian soldiers, then Egyptian citizens.&lt;ref&gt;[https://maktoob.sports.yahoo.com/video/%D8%A7%D9%84%D9%83%D8%B4%D8%B1%D9%8A-%D8%AA%D8%A7%D8%B1%D9%8A%D8%AE-%D9%88%D8%B5%D9%86%D8%A7%D8%B9%D8%A9-164831776.html yahoo- maktoob CNBC]&lt;/ref&gt; ''Kushari ''used to be sold on [[food cart]]s in its early years, and was introduced to restaurants later.&lt;ref name=Parvi&gt;{{cite news |last1=Parvi |first1=Shahrokh |title=Cheap, healthy and oh so tasty: the best kushari in Cairo |url=https://www.theguardian.com/travel/2016/mar/06/kushari-cairo-rice-lentils-pasta-spicy-cheap |work=[[The Guardian]] |date=6 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This dish is widely popular among workers and laborers. It may be prepared at home, and is also served at roadside stalls and restaurants all over Egypt; some restaurants specialize in ''kushari'' to the exclusion of other dishes, while others feature it as one item among many.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.whats4eats.com/pastas/kushari-recipe |title=Kushari recipe |publisher=Whats4eats.com |date= |accessdate=2013-02-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; As traditionally prepared ''kushari'' does not contain any animal products, it can be considered [[vegan]], so long as all frying uses vegetable oil.

A '''language survey''' is conducted around the world for a variety of reasons.

*measuring people's ability to speak and understand another language (usually community based, not school based) ([[multilingualism]])
*studying people's attitudes about different languages (Rensch 1993)
*evaluating the differences and similarities in speech of communities that speak related speech forms, noting comprehension or collecting details of linguistic form ([[dialectology]]) (Labov 1982, Backstrom 1992,  Egland 1978)
*assessing the vitality of languages that may be disappearing ([[language death]]) (Statistic Canada 1993, Ferreira and Holbrook 2002)
*doing initial descriptions of languages in areas that are linguistically undescribed (King and King 1984)

== Methods ==
Methods used in language surveys depend on the questions that the survey is trying to answer.  Methods used include collecting word lists (Bender 1971), playing recorded texts to assess comprehension (Casad 1974), sentence repetition tests (Radloff 1991), questionnaires (Hochstetler and Tillinghast 1996), group and individual interviews, retelling of stories (McKinnies and Priestly 2004), direct observation (Cooper and Carpenter 1976),  and even internet surveys (tafesilafai.org).

As with any form of [[research]], the methods used depend on the questions that the researchers are trying to answer.  Also, the reliability of the results varies according to the method and the rigor with which it is applied, proper sampling technique, etc.

== Applications ==
The results of language surveys are use for a variety of purposes.  One of the most common is in making decisions for implementing educational programs.  The results have also been used for making decision for language development work (Holbrook, 2001).  And of course, academics are always interested in the results of any language survey.

== Agencies ==
Surveys have also been conducted by ethnic associations (Saskatchewan 1991), government agencies (Statistics Canada 1993),  NGO's (Toba, et al. 2002), foundations ([[Pew Hispanic Center]] 2004), etc.  Often such groups work together (Clifton 2002).  Some large and notable surveys include the Language Survey of India which was begun by [[George Abraham Grierson]]  late in the 19th century ([[Sociolinguistics research in India]]) and the Survey of Language Use and Language Teaching in East Africa, sponsored by the [[Ford Foundation]] from the 1960s.  Both resulted in a number of volumes describing locations of languages, patterns of multilingualism, language classification, and also included descriptions of languages, such as ''Language in Ethiopia'' ([[Lionel Bender (linguist)|Bender]], Bowen, Cooper, and [[Charles A. Ferguson|Ferguson]] 1976). The single agency conducting the most language surveys around the world is [[SIL International]] (Summer Institute of Linguistics).  The results of many of their surveys are posted on the web: http://www.sil.org/silesr.

== Sign languages ==
Surveys have usually been conducted among spoken languages.  However, surveys have also been done among users of [[sign language]]s (Vasishta, Woodward, and Wilson 1978,  Woodward 1991, 1993, 1996, Parkhurst &amp; Parkhurst 1998, Al-Fityani &amp; Padden 2008). As with surveys among spoken languages, surveys among sign languages have studied multilingualism, attitudes about various languages both spoken and signed (Ciupek-Reed 2012), differences and similarities between signed varieties (Aldersson and McEntee-Atalianis 2007, Bickford 1991, 2005, Parks 2011), and assessing the vitality of signed languages, and initial descriptions of undocumented sign languages.

[[music of Suriname|Surinamese music]], especially [[kaseko]], is also very popular in [[French Guiana]].

==Aléké==

[[Aléké]] is a style of drum-based music that arose in the 1950s.{{Citation needed|date = April 2014}} It is similar to salsa music and merengue. The first major group was Salka, followed by major bands like [[Bigi Ting]] and [[Fondering]]. Modern performers include [[Bigi Monie]] (Saint-Laurent), [[Bigi Libi]] and [[Young Clémencia]] (Grand Santi), [[Wan Ton Melody]] and [[Big Control]] ([[Papaïchton]]), [[Slave (musician)|Slave]] and [[Bigi Laï]] ([[Maripasoula]]). Historical groups include [[Pokina and Lagadisssa]] (from Paramaribo), [[Clémencia and Alkowa]] (from Grand Santi), [[Rasta (musician)|Rasta]] (from Papaïchton), [[Tranga Oousel]] (from [[Maripasoula]]), [[Mabouya]] (from Apatou), [[Switi Lobi]] (from Albina), [[Sapatia]], [[Lespeki]] and [[Africa (band)|Africa]] (from Saint-Laurent du Maroni).

==Bigi Pokoe==

The [[bigi pokoe]] is a style of [[dance music]] in the west of French Guiana and Suriname.  It is traditionally played with drums and maracas, although today guitars, keyboards and percussion instruments are used.

[[Intermix (French Guiana band)|Intermix]], [[Tchoutcha]], [[Inter Spoity]] ([[Apatou]]), [[Multi System]] and [[Compress 220v]] (Saint Laurent), who toured in Europe in 1999, are the main representatives of this style.

==Bushee Negro music==

[[Awassa]], [[Mato music|mato]] and [[soussa music|soussa]] are important kinds of [[Bushee Negro]] music.  Other rhythms and styles include [[kawina]].

'''Old Irish''' ({{lang-sga|Goídelc}}; {{lang-ga|Sean-Ghaeilge}}; {{lang-gd|Seann Ghàidhlig}}; {{lang-gv|Shenn Yernish}}; sometimes called '''Old Gaelic''')&lt;ref name="koch"&gt;{{cite book |title=Celtic culture: a historical encyclopedia |last=Koch |first=John Thomas |year=2006 |publisher=ABC-CLIO |page=831 |chapter= |quote=The Old Irish of the period c.&amp;nbsp;600–c.&amp;nbsp;900&amp;nbsp;AD is as yet virtually devoid of dialect differences, and may be treated as the common ancestor of the Irish, Scottish Gaelic, and Manx of the Middle Ages and modern period; Old Irish is thus sometimes called 'Old Gaelic' to avoid confusion.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The Edinburgh History of the Scots Language |last=Ó Baoill |first=Colm |year=1997 |publisher=Edinburgh University Press |page=551 |chapter=13: The Scots-Gaelic Interface |quote=The oldest form of the standard that we have is the language of the period c.&amp;nbsp;AD&amp;nbsp;600–900, usually called 'Old Irish' – but this use of the word 'Irish' is a misapplication (popular among English-speakers in both Ireland and Scotland), for that period of the language would be more accurately called 'Old Gaelic'.}}&lt;/ref&gt; is the name given to the oldest form of the [[Goidelic languages]] for which extensive written texts are extant. It was used from {{circa}}600 to {{circa}}900. The primary contemporary texts are dated {{circa}}700–850; by 900 the language had already transitioned into early [[Middle Irish]]. Some Old Irish texts date from the 10th century, although these are presumably copies of texts composed at an earlier time period. Old Irish is thus forebear to [[Irish language|Modern Irish]], [[Manx language|Manx]], and [[Scottish Gaelic]].&lt;ref name="koch" /&gt;

Old Irish is known for having a particularly complex system of [[morphology (linguistics)|morphology]] and especially of [[allomorphy]] (more or less unpredictable variations in stems and suffixes in differing circumstances) as well as a complex [[phonology|sound system]] involving grammatically significant [[Irish initial mutations|consonant mutations]] to the initial consonant of a word. Apparently,&lt;ref group=*&gt;It is difficult to know for sure, given how little [[Primitive Irish]] is attested and the limitations of the [[Ogham]] alphabet used to write it.&lt;/ref&gt; neither characteristic was present in the preceding [[Primitive Irish]] period, though initial mutations likely existed in a non-grammaticalized form in the prehistoric era{{sfn|Jaskuła|2006}}. Much of the complex allomorphy was subsequently lost, but the sound system has been maintained with little change in the modern languages.

Contemporary Old Irish scholarship is still greatly influenced by the works of a small number of scholars active in the late 19th and early 20th centuries such as [[Rudolf Thurneysen]] (1857–1940) and [[Osborn Bergin]] (1873–1950).

==Notable characteristics==
Notable characteristics of Old Irish compared with other old [[Indo-European languages]], are:
* Initial mutations, including lenition, nasalisation and aspiration/gemination.
* A complex system of verbal allomorphy&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://mvtabilitie.blogspot.com/2008/09/also-known-as-most-demanding.html|title=THE CANTOS OF MVTABILITIE: The Old Irish Verbal System|last=Bo|date=2008-09-27|website=THE CANTOS OF MVTABILITIE|access-date=2018-10-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;.
* A system of ''conjugated prepositions'' that is unusual in Indo-European languages (although they are found in many [[Semitic languages]] such as [[Arabic language|Arabic]]): ''dím'' "from me", ''dít'' "from you", ''de'' "from him", ''di'' "from her", ''diib'' "from them" (basic preposition ''di'' "from"). There is a great deal of allomorphy here, as well.
* Infixed object prepositions, which are inserted between the verb stem and its prefix(es). If a verb lacks any prefixes, a dummy prefix is normally added.
* Special verbal conjugations are used to signal the beginning of a [[relative clause]]

Old Irish also preserves most aspects of the complicated [[Proto-Indo-European language|Proto-Indo-European]] (PIE) system of morphology. Nouns and adjectives are [[declension|declined]] in three genders (masculine, feminine, neuter); three numbers (singular, dual, plural); and five cases (nominative, vocative, accusative, dative and genitive). Most [[Proto-Indo-European nouns|PIE noun stem classes]] are maintained (''o''-, ''yo''-, ''ā''-, ''yā''-, ''i''-, ''u''-, ''r''-, ''n''-, ''s''-, and consonant stems). Most of the complexities of [[Proto-Indo-European verbs|PIE verbal conjugation]] are also maintained, and there are new complexities introduced by various [[sound change]]s (see [[#Verbal allomorphy|below]]).

==Classification==
Old Irish was the only member of the [[Goidelic languages|Goidelic/Gaelic]] branch of the [[Celtic languages]], which is, in turn, a subfamily of the wider [[Indo-European language]] family that also includes the [[Slavonic languages|Slavonic]], [[Italic languages|Italic]]/[[Romance languages|Romance]], [[Indo-Aryan languages|Indo-Aryan]] and [[Germanic languages|Germanic]] subfamilies, along with several others. Old Irish is the ancestor of all modern Goidelic languages: [[Irish language|Modern Irish]], [[Scottish Gaelic]] and [[Manx language|Manx]].

A still older form of Irish is known as [[Primitive Irish]]. Fragments of Primitive Irish, mainly personal names, are known from inscriptions on stone written in the [[Ogham]] alphabet. The inscriptions date from about the 4th to the 6th centuries. Primitive Irish appears to have been very close to [[Proto-Celtic language|Common Celtic]], the ancestor of all [[Celtic languages]], and it had a lot of the characteristics of other archaic Indo-European languages.

==Sources==
Relatively little survives in the way of strictly contemporary sources. They are represented mainly by shorter or longer [[Gloss (margin text)|gloss]]es on the margins or [[interlinear gloss|between the lines]] of religious [[Latin]] [[manuscripts]], most of them preserved in monasteries in Germany, Italy, Switzerland, France and Austria, having been taken there by [[Hiberno-Scottish mission|early Irish missionaries]]. Whereas in Ireland, many of the older manuscripts appear to have been worn out through extended and heavy use, their counterparts on the Continent were much less prone to the same risk because once they ceased to be understood, they were rarely consulted.{{sfn|Thurneysen|1946|p=4}}

The earliest Old Irish passages may be the transcripts found in the [[Cambrai Homily]], which is thought to belong to the early 8th century. The [[Book of Armagh]] contains texts from the early 9th century. Important Continental collections of glosses from the 8th and 9th century include the [[Würzburg]] Glosses (mainly) on the [[Pauline Epistles]], the [[Milan]] Glosses on a commentary to the [[Psalms]] and the [[St Gallen|St Gall]] Glosses on [[Priscian]]'s Grammar.

Further examples are found at [[Karlsruhe]] (Germany), Paris (France), Milan, [[Florence]] and [[Turin]] (Italy). A late 9th-century manuscript from the abbey at [[Reichenau Island|Reichenau]], now in [[St. Paul in Carinthia]] (Austria), contains a spell and four Old Irish poems. The ''[[Liber Hymnorum]]'' and the ''[[Stowe Missal]]'' date from about 900 to 1050.

In addition to contemporary witnesses, the vast majority of Old Irish texts are attested in manuscripts of a variety of later dates. Manuscripts of the later Middle Irish period, such as the [[Lebor na hUidre]] and the [[Book of Leinster]], contain texts, which are thought to derive from written exemplars in Old Irish now lost and retain enough of their original form to merit classification as Old Irish.

The preservation of certain linguistic forms current in the Old Irish period may provide reason to assume that an Old Irish original directly or indirectly underlies the transmitted text or texts.

==Phonology==

===Consonants===
The [[consonant]] inventory of Old Irish is shown in the chart below. The complexity of Old Irish phonology is from a four-way split of phonemes inherited from Primitive Irish, with both a [[fortis and lenis|fortis–lenis]] and a "broad–slender" ([[velarization|velarised]] vs. [[Palatalization (phonetics)|palatalised]]) distinction arising from historical changes. The sounds {{IPA|/f v θ ð x ɣ h ṽ n l r/}} are the broad lenis equivalents of broad fortis {{IPA|/p b t d k ɡ s m N L R/}}; likewise for the slender (palatalised) equivalents. (However, most {{IPA|/f fʲ/}} sounds actually derive historically from {{IPA|/w/}}.)

Some details of Old Irish [[phonetics]] are not known. {{IPA|/sʲ/}} may have been pronounced {{IPA|[ɕ]}} or {{IPA|[ʃ]}}, as in Modern Irish. {{IPA|/hʲ/}} may have been the same sound as {{IPA|/h/}} or {{IPA|/xʲ/}}. The precise articulation of the fortis [[sonorant]]s {{IPA|/N/, /Nʲ/, /L/, /Lʲ/, /R/, /Rʲ/}} is unknown, but they were probably longer, [[tenseness|tenser]] and generally more strongly articulated than their lenis counterparts {{IPA|/n/, /nʲ/, /l/, /lʲ/, /r/, /rʲ/}}, as in the Modern Irish and Scottish dialects that still possess a four-way distinction in the [[coronal consonant|coronal]] [[nasal consonant|nasals]] and [[lateral consonant|laterals]]. {{IPA|/Nʲ/}} and {{IPA|/Lʲ/}} may have been pronounced {{IPA|[ɲ]}} and {{IPA|[ʎ]}} respectively. The difference between {{IPA|/R(ʲ)/}} and {{IPA|/r(ʲ)/}} may have been that the former were [[trill consonant|trills]] while the latter were [[flap consonant|flaps]]. {{IPA|/m(ʲ)/}} and {{IPA|/ṽ(ʲ)/}} were derived from an original fortis–lenis pair.

===Vowels===
Old Irish had distinctive [[vowel length]] in both [[monophthong]]s and [[diphthong]]s. Short diphthongs were [[mora (linguistics)|monomoraic]], taking up the same amount of time as short vowels, while long diphthongs were bimoraic, the same as long vowels. (This is much like the situation in [[Old English]] but different from [[Ancient Greek]] whose shorter and longer diphthongs were bimoraic and trimoraic, respectively: {{IPA|/ai/}} vs. {{IPA|/aːi/}}.) The inventory of Old Irish long vowels changed significantly over the Old Irish period, but the short vowels changed much less.

The following short vowels existed:

:{| class="wikitable" style="text-align: center;"
!
! colspan="2" | Monophthongs

|-
![[Close vowel|Close]]

|-

|-
![[Open vowel|Open]]
| colspan="2" align="center" | {{IPA|a}}
| colspan="2" align="center" | {{IPA|ău}}
|}

&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;The short diphthong {{IPA|ŏu}} may have existed very early in the Old Irish period/but not later on.

Archaic Old Irish (before about 750) had the following inventory of long vowels:

:{|class="wikitable"
!
! colspan="2" | Monophthongs
! colspan="2" | Diphthongs
|-
! [[Close vowel|Close]]
| {{IPA|iː}}
| {{IPA|uː}}
| {{IPA|iu}}
| {{IPA|ui}}
|-
! [[Mid vowel|Mid]]
| {{IPA|e₁ː, e₂ː}}&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;
| {{IPA|o₁ː}}, ({{IPA|o₂ː}}?)&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;
| {{IPA|eu}}
| {{IPA|oi}}, ({{IPA|ou}})&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;
|-
! [[Open vowel|Open]]
| colspan="2" | {{IPA|aː}}
| colspan="2" | {{IPA|ai, au}}&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;
|}

&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;Both {{IPA|/e₁ː/}} and {{IPA|/e₂ː/}} were normally written ''é'' but must have been pronounced differently because they have different origins and distinct outcomes in later Old Irish. {{IPA|/e₁ː/}} stems from Proto-Celtic *ē (&lt; PIE *ei), or from ''ē'' in words borrowed from Latin. {{IPA|e₂ː}} generally stems from [[compensatory lengthening]] of short *e because of loss of the following consonant (in certain clusters) or a directly following vowel in [[hiatus (linguistics)|hiatus]]. It is generally thought that {{IPA|/e₁ː/}} was higher than {{IPA|/e₂ː/}}.{{sfn|Kortlandt|2007|p=8}} Perhaps {{IPA|/e₁ː/}} was {{IPA|[eː]}} while {{IPA|/e₂ː/}} was {{IPA|[ɛː]}}. They are clearly distinguished in later Old Irish, in which {{IPA|/e₁ː/}} becomes ''ía'' (but ''é'' before a palatal consonant). {{IPA|/e₂ː/}} becomes ''é'' in all circumstances. Furthermore, {{IPA|/e₂ː/}} is subject to ''u''-affection, becoming ''éu'' or ''íu'', while {{IPA|/e₁ː/}} is not.

&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;A similar distinction may have existed between {{IPA|/o₁ː/}} and {{IPA|/o₂ː/}}, both written ''ó'', and stemming respectively from former diphthongs (*eu, *au, *ou) and from compensatory lengthening. However, in later Old Irish both sounds appear usually as ''úa'', sometimes as ''ó'', and it is unclear whether {{IPA|/o₂ː/}} existed as a separate sound any time in the Old Irish period.

&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;{{IPA|/ou/}} existed only in early archaic Old Irish ({{circa}}700 or earlier); afterwards it merged into {{IPA|/au/}}. Neither sound occurred before another consonant, and both sounds became ''ó'' in later Old Irish (often ''ú'' or ''u'' before another vowel). The late ''ó'' does not develop into ''úa'', suggesting that ''áu'' &gt; ''ó'' postdated ''ó'' &gt; ''úa''.

Later Old Irish had the following inventory of long vowels:

:{| class="wikitable" style="text-align: center;"
!
! colspan="2" | Monophthongs
! colspan="2" | Diphthongs
|-
! [[Close vowel|Close]]
| {{IPA|iː}}

| {{IPA|iu, ia}}
| {{IPA|ui, ua}}
|-
! [[Mid vowel|Mid]]
| {{IPA|eː}}
| {{IPA|oː}}
| {{IPA|eu}}
| {{IPA|oi?}}&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;
|-
! [[Open vowel|Open]]
| colspan="2" | {{IPA|aː}}
| colspan="2" |
|}

&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;Early Old Irish {{IPA|/ai/}} and {{IPA|/oi/}} merged in later Old Irish. It is unclear what the resulting sound was, as scribes continued to use both ''aí'' and ''oí'' to indicate the merged sound. The choice of {{IPA|/oi/}} in the table above is somewhat arbitrary.

The distribution of short [[vowel]]s in [[stress (linguistics)|unstressed]] [[syllable]]s is a little complicated. All short vowels may appear in absolutely final position (at the very end of a word) after both broad and slender consonants. The front vowels {{IPA|/e/}} and {{IPA|/i/}} are often spelled ''ae'' and ''ai'' after broad consonants, which might indicate a retracted pronunciation here, perhaps something like {{IPA|[ɘ]}} and {{IPA|[ɨ]}}. All ten possibilities are shown in the following examples:

|}

The distribution of short vowels in unstressed syllables, other than when absolutely final, was quite restricted. It is usually thought that there were only two allowed phonemes: {{IPA|/ə/}} (written ''a'', ''ai'', ''e'' or ''i'' depending on the quality of surrounding consonants) and {{IPA|/u/}} (written ''u'' or ''o''). The phoneme {{IPA|/u/}} tended to occur when the following syllable contained an *ū in [[Proto-Celtic language|Proto-Celtic]] (for example, {{lang|sga|dligud}}  {{IPA|/ˈdʲlʲiɣ'''u'''ð/}} "law" (dat.) &lt; PC *''dligedū''), or after a broad [[labial consonant|labial]] (for example, {{lang|sga|lebor}} {{IPA|/ˈLʲev'''o'''r/}} "book"; ''domun'' {{IPA|/ˈdoṽ'''u'''n/}} "world"). The phoneme {{IPA|/ə/}} occurred in other circumstances. The occurrence of the two phonemes was generally unrelated to the nature of the corresponding Proto-Celtic vowel, which could be any monophthong: long or short.

Long vowels also occur in unstressed syllables. However, they rarely reflect Proto-Celtic long vowels, which were shortened prior to the deletion (syncope) of inner syllables. Rather, they originate in one of the following ways:
*from the late resolution of a [[hiatus (linguistics)|hiatus]] of two adjacent vowels (usually as a result of loss of *s between vowels);
*from [[compensatory lengthening]] in response to loss of a consonant (''cenél'' "kindred, gender" &lt; *''cenethl''; ''du·air-chér'' "I have purchased" &lt; *''-chechr'', preterite of ''crenaid'' "buys"{{sfn|Thurneysen|1946|p=79}});
*from assimilation of an unstressed vowel to a corresponding long stressed vowel;
*from late compounding;
*from lengthening of short vowels before unlenited {{IPA|/m, N, L, R/}}, still in progress in Old Irish (compare ''erríndem'' "highest" vs. ''rind'' "peak"{{sfn|Thurneysen|1946|p=32}}).

===Stress===
Stress is generally on the first syllable of a word. However, in verbs it occurs on the second syllable when the first syllable is a [[clitic]] (the verbal prefix ''as-'' in ''as·beir'' {{IPA|/asˈberʲ/}} "he says"). In such cases, the unstressed prefix is indicated in grammatical works with a following centre dot (·).

==Orthography==
As with most medieval languages, the [[orthography]] of Old Irish is not fixed, so the following statements are to be taken as generalisations only. Individual [[manuscript]]s may vary greatly from these guidelines.

The Old Irish [[alphabet]] consists of the following eighteen [[Letter (alphabet)|letters]] of the [[Latin alphabet]]:
:''a'', ''b'', ''c'', ''d'', ''e'', ''f'', ''g'', ''h'', ''i'', ''l'', ''m'', ''n'', ''o'', ''p'', ''r'', ''s'', ''t'', ''u''

In addition, the [[acute accent]] and the [[dot (diacritic)|superdot]] are used as [[diacritic]]s with certain letters:
*The acute accent indicates a long [[vowel]]. The following are long vowels: ''á'', ''é'', ''í'', ''ó'', ''ú''.
*The superdot indicates the [[lenition]] of ''f'' and ''s'': ''ḟ'' is silent, ''ṡ'' is pronounced {{IPA|/h/}}
*The superdot is also sometimes used on ''m'' and ''n'', with no change in pronunciation, when these letters are used to mark the nasal mutation: ''ṁ'', ''ṅ''.

Some [[digraph (orthography)|digraph]]s are also used:
:The letter ''i'' is placed after a vowel letter to indicate that the following consonant was palatalised: ''ai'', ''ei'', ''oi'', ''ui''; ''ái'', ''éi'', ''ói'', ''úi''
:The letter ''h'' is placed after ''c'', ''t'', ''p'' to indicate a [[fricative]]: ''ch'', ''th'', ''ph''
:The diphthongs are also indicated by digraphs: ''áe''/''aí'', ''ía'', ''uí'', ''áu'', ''óe''/''oí'', ''úa'', ''éu'', ''óu'', ''iu'', ''au'', ''eu''

The following table indicates the broad pronunciation of various consonant letters in various environments:

Notes:
*A dash (—) in an entry indicates that the respective consonant sound is spelled differently under the respective mutation (lenition or nasalisation) and so the indicated consonant letter does not occur then (the spelling ''c'' does not occur in a leniting environment; instead, ''ch'' /x/ does). See the next two entries.
*Lenited ''c, p, t'' are spelled ''ch'' {{IPA|/x/}}, ''ph'' {{IPA|/f/}}, ''th'' {{IPA|/θ/}} respectively.
*Nasalized ''b, d, g'' are spelled ''m-b'' {{IPA|/mb/}}, ''n-d'' {{IPA|/nd/}}, ''n-g'' {{IPA|/nɡ/}} {{IPA|[ŋɡ]}} respectively.
*In some cases, lenited ''f'' and ''s'' are spelled with a superdot.
*When initial ''s'' stemmed from Primitive Irish ''*sw-'', its lenited version is ''f'' (written and pronounced).

The slender ([[Palatalization (phonetics)|palatalised]]) variants of the above consonants occur in the following environments:
*before a written ''e'', ''é'', ''i'', ''í'';
*after a written ''i'', when not followed by a vowel letter (but not after the diphthongs ''aí'', ''oí'', ''uí'').

Although Old Irish has both a sound {{IPA|/h/}} and a letter ''h'', there is no consistent relationship between the two. Vowel-initial words are sometimes written with an unpronounced ''h'', especially if they are very short (the [[preposition]] {{lang|sga|i}} "in" was sometimes written {{lang|sga|hi}}) or if they need to be emphasised (the name of Ireland, {{lang|sga|Ériu}}, was sometimes written {{lang|sga|Hériu}}). On the other hand, words that begin with the sound {{IPA|/h/}} are usually written without it: {{lang|sga|a ór}} {{IPA|/a hoːr/}} "her gold". If the sound and the spelling [[co-occurrence|co-occur]], it is by coincidence, as {{lang|sga|ní hed}} {{IPA|/Nʲiː heð/}} "it is not".

After a vowel or ''l'', ''n'', or ''r'' the letters ''c, p, t'' can stand for either voiced or voiceless stops; they can also be written double with either value:

Geminate consonants appear to have existed at the beginning of the Old Irish period but were simplified by the end, as is generally reflected by the spelling generally although double ''ll'', ''mm'', ''nn'', ''rr'' were eventually repurposed to indicate nonlenited variants of those sounds in certain positions.

After a vowel the letters ''b'', ''d'', ''g'' stand for the fricatives {{IPA|/v, ð, ɣ/}} or their slender equivalents:

After vowels ''m'' is usually a fricative, but sometimes a (nasal) stop, in which case it is also often written double:

The digraphs ''ch'', ''ph'', ''th'' do not occur in word-initial position except under lenition, but wherever they occur, they are pronounced {{IPA|/x/, /f/, /θ/}}.

The letters ''l'', ''n'', and ''r'' are generally written double when they indicate the tense sonorants, single when they indicate the lax sonorants. Originally, it reflected an actual difference between single and geminate consonants, as tense sonorants in many positions (such as between vowels or word-finally) developed from geminates. As the gemination was lost, the use of written double consonants was repurposed to indicate tense sonorants. Doubly written consonants of this sort do not occur in positions where tense sonorants developed from non-geminated Proto-Celtic sonorants (such as word-initially or before a consonant).

Written vowels ''a'', ''ai'', ''e'', ''i'' in poststressed syllables (except absolutely word-finally) all seem to represent phonemic {{IPA|/ə/}}. The particular vowel that appears is determined by the quality (broad vs. slender) of the surrounding consonants and has no relation to the etymological vowel quality:

== History ==
Old Irish was affected by a series of [[phonological change]]s that radically altered its appearance compared with [[Proto-Celtic language|Proto-Celtic]] and older Celtic languages (such as [[Gaulish language|Gaulish]], which still had the appearance of typical early Indo-European languages such as [[Latin]] or [[Ancient Greek]]). The changes were such that Irish was not recognized as Indo-European at all for much of the 19th century. The changes must have happened quite rapidly, perhaps in only one or two hundred years around 500–600, because almost none of the changes are visible in [[Primitive Irish]] (4th to 6th centuries), and all of them are already complete in archaic Old Irish (8th century). A capsule summary of the most important changes is (in approximate order):{{sfn|Kortlandt|2007}}{{sfn|Greene|1973}}

# Syllable-final {{lang|cel-x-proto|n}} (from PIE {{lang|cel-x-proto|m}}, {{lang|cel-x-proto|n}}) assimilated to the following phoneme, even across word boundaries in the case of syntactically connected words.
#* Voiceless stops became voiced: {{lang|cel-x-proto|mp}} {{lang|cel-x-proto|nt}} {{lang|cel-x-proto|nk}} &gt; {{IPA|/b d ɡ/}}.
#* Voiced stops became prenasalised {{IPA|/ᵐb, ⁿd, ᵑɡ/}}. They were reduced to simple nasals during the Old Irish period.
#* Before a vowel, {{IPA|/n-/}} was attached to the beginning of the syllable.
# [[Lenition]] of all single consonants between vowels. That applied across word boundaries in the case of syntactically connected words.
#* Stops became fricatives.
#* {{lang|cel-x-proto|s}} became {{IPA|/h/}} (later lost unless the following syllable was stressed).
#* {{lang|cel-x-proto|w}} was eventually lost (much later).
#* {{lang|cel-x-proto|m}} became a nasalised [[continuant]] ({{IPA|/w̃/}}; perhaps {{IPA|[w̃]}} or {{IPA|[β̃]}}).
#* {{lang|cel-x-proto|l}} {{lang|cel-x-proto|n}} {{lang|cel-x-proto|r}} remained, but the non-lenited variants were strengthened to {{IPA|/L N R/}} (see [[#Phonology|phonology section above]]).
# Extensive [[Affection (linguistics)|umlaut]] ("affection") of short vowels, which were raised or lowered to agree with the height of following Proto-Celtic vowels. Similarly, rounding of {{lang|cel-x-proto|a}} to {{IPA|/o/}} or {{IPA|/u/}} often occurred adjacent to [[labial consonant]]s.
# [[Palatalization (phonetics)|Palatalization]] of all consonants before front vowels.
# Loss of part or all of final syllables.
# Loss of most interior vowels ([[syncope (phonetics)|syncope]]).

They led to the following effects:
* Both the palatalised ("slender") and lenited variants of consonants were [[phoneme|phonemicised]], multiplying the consonant inventory by four (broad, broad lenited, slender, slender lenited). Variations between broad and slender became an important part of the grammar:
** in masc. {{lang|sga|o}}-stems: {{lang|sga|macc}} "son" (nom. acc.) vs. {{lang|sga|maicc}} (gen.), {{lang|sga|cúl}} "back" (nom. acc.) vs. {{lang|sga|cúil}} (gen.), cf. Latin {{lang|la|-us}} (nom.), {{lang|sga|-um}} (acc.) vs. {{lang|sga|-ī}} (gen.);
** in fem. {{lang|sga|ā}}-stems: {{lang|sga|túath}} "tribe, people" (nom.) vs. {{lang|sga|túaith}} (acc. dat.), {{lang|sga|mucc}} "pig" (nom.) vs. {{lang|sga|muicc}} (acc. dat.);
** in {{lang|sga|r}}-stems: {{lang|sga|athar}} "father" (gen.) vs. {{lang|sga|ath(a)ir}} (nom. acc. dat.).
* Lenition and nasal assimilation across word boundaries in syntactically connected words produced extensive [[sandhi]] effects ([[Irish initial mutations]]). The variations became an important part of the grammar.
* Both umlaut (vowel affection) and especially syncope radically increased the amount of allomorphy found across declensions and conjugations. The most dramatic deviations are due to syncope: compare {{lang|sga|as·'''ber'''at}} "they say" vs. {{lang|sga|ní-'''e'''pret}} "they do not say" or {{lang|sga|do·'''ró'''sc(a)i}} "he surpasses" vs. {{lang|sga|ní-'''der'''scaigi}} "he does not surpass" (where the stressed syllable is boldfaced).

|}

=== Allomorphy ===
These various changes, especially syncope, produced quite complex [[allomorphy]], because the addition of prefixes or various pre-verbal particles ([[proclitic]]s) in Proto-Celtic changed the syllable containing the stress: According to the Celtic variant of [[Clitic#Word_order|Wackernagel's law]], the stress fell on the second syllable of the verbal complex, including any prefixes and clitics. By the Old Irish period, most of this allomorphy still remained, although it was rapidly eliminated beginning in the Middle Irish period.

Among the most striking changes are in prefixed verbs with or without pre-verbal particles. With a single prefix and without a proclitic, stress falls on the verbal root, which assumes the ''deuterotonic'' ("second-stressed") form. With a prefix and also with a proclitic, stress falls on the prefix, and the verb assumes the ''prototonic'' ("first-stressed") form. Rather extreme allomorphic differences can result:

The most extreme allomorphy of all came from the third person singular of the {{lang|sga|s}}-subjunctive because an athematic person marker {{lang|sga|-t}} was used, added directly onto the verbal stem (formed by adding {{lang|sga|-s}} directly onto the root). That led to a complex word-final cluster, which was deleted entirely. In the prototonic form (after two proclitics), the root was unstressed and thus the root vowel was also deleted, leaving only the first consonant:

=== Syncope in detail ===
In more detail, syncope of final and intervocalic syllables involved the following steps (in approximate order):
* Shortening of absolutely final long vowels.
* Loss of most final consonants, including {{lang|cel-x-proto|m}}, {{lang|cel-x-proto|n}}, {{lang|cel-x-proto|d}}, {{lang|cel-x-proto|t}}, {{lang|cel-x-proto|k}}, and all clusters involving {{lang|cel-x-proto|s}} (except {{lang|cel-x-proto|rs}}, {{lang|cel-x-proto|ls}}, where only the {{lang|cel-x-proto|s}} is lost).
* Loss of absolutely final short vowels (including those that became final as a result of loss of a final consonant and original long final vowels).
* Shortening of long vowels in unstressed syllables.
* Collapsing of vowels in hiatus (producing new unstressed long vowels).
* [[Syncope (phonetics)|Syncope]] (deletion) of vowels in every other interior unstressed syllable following the stress. If there are two remaining syllables after the stress, the first one loses its vowel; if there are four remaining syllables after the stress, the first and third lose their vowel.
* Resolution of impossible clusters resulting from syncope and final-vowel deletion:
** Adjacent homorganic [[obstruent]]s where either sound was a fricative became a geminate stop, voiceless if either sound was voiceless (e.g. {{lang|cel-x-proto|ðð}} {{lang|cel-x-proto|dð}} {{lang|cel-x-proto|ðd}} &gt; {{IPA|/dd/}}; {{lang|cel-x-proto|θð}} {{lang|cel-x-proto|ðθ}} {{lang|cel-x-proto|θd}} {{lang|cel-x-proto|tθ}} etc. &gt; {{IPA|/tt/}}).
** Otherwise, adjacent obstruents assumed the voicing of the second consonant (e.g. {{lang|cel-x-proto|dt}} &gt; {{IPA|/tt/}}; {{lang|cel-x-proto|kd}} &gt; {{IPA|/gd/}}; {{lang|cel-x-proto|ɣt}} &gt; {{IPA|/xt/}}).
** {{lang|cel-x-proto|l}} {{lang|cel-x-proto|r}} {{lang|cel-x-proto|n}} not adjacent to a vowel became syllabic and then had a vowel inserted before them (e.g. {{lang|sga|domun}} "world" &lt; {{lang|cel-x-proto|domn}} &lt; {{lang|cel-x-proto|domnos}} &lt; {{lang|cel-x-proto|dumnos}}; {{lang|sga|immormus}} "sin" &lt; {{lang|cel-x-proto|imm-ro-mess}}). However, in the case of {{lang|cel-x-proto|n}}, that occurred only when the nasal had not previously been joined to a following voiced stop as a result of nasal assimilation: compare {{lang|sga|frecnd(a)irc}} "present" (disyllabic).
** Remaining impossible clusters were generally simplified by deletion of consonants not adjacent to vowels (such as between other consonants). However, Old Irish tolerated geminates adjacent to other consonants as well other quite complex clusters: {{lang|sga|ainm}} {{IPA|/aNʲm/}} "name" (one syllable), {{lang|sga|fedb}} {{IPA|/fʲeðβ/}} "widow", {{lang|sga|do-aidbdetar}} {{IPA|/do-ˈaðʲβʲðʲədər/}} "they are shown".{{sfn|Thurneysen|1946|pp=70,100}}

=== Proto-Celtic short vowels, vowel affection ===
All five Proto-Celtic short vowels ({{lang|cel-x-proto|a}}, {{lang|cel-x-proto|e}}, {{lang|cel-x-proto|i}}, {{lang|cel-x-proto|o}}, {{lang|cel-x-proto|u}}) survived into Primitive Irish more or less unchanged in stressed syllables.

However, during the runup to Old Irish, several mutations ([[umlaut (linguistics)|umlauts]]) take place. Former vowels are modified in various ways depending on the following vowels (or sometimes surrounding consonants). The mutations are known in Celtic literature as ''affections'' or ''infections'' such as these, the most important ones:{{sfn|Thurneysen|1946|pp=46–50,57}}
# {{lang|sga|i}}-affection: Short {{lang|cel-x-proto|e}} and {{lang|cel-x-proto|o}} are raised to {{lang|sga|i}} and {{lang|sga|u}} when the following syllable contains a high vowel ({{lang|cel-x-proto|i}}, {{lang|cel-x-proto|ī}}, {{lang|cel-x-proto|u}}, {{lang|cel-x-proto|ū}}). It does not happen when the vowels are separated by certain consonant groups.
# {{lang|sga|a}}-affection: Short {{lang|cel-x-proto|i}} and {{lang|cel-x-proto|u}} are lowered to {{lang|sga|e}} and {{lang|sga|o}} when the following syllable contains a non-high back vowel ({{lang|cel-x-proto|a}}, {{lang|cel-x-proto|ā}}, {{lang|cel-x-proto|o}}, {{lang|cel-x-proto|ō}}{{clarify|Proto-Celtic had no {{lang|pgl|*ō}}, where did this come from?|date=September 2014}}).
# {{lang|sga|u}}-affection: Short {{lang|cel-x-proto|a}}, {{lang|cel-x-proto|e}}, {{lang|cel-x-proto|i}} are broken to short diphthongs {{lang|sga|au}}, {{lang|sga|eu}}, {{lang|sga|iu}} when the following syllable contains a {{lang|cel-x-proto|u}} or {{lang|pgl|*ū}} that was later lost. It is assumed that at the point the change operated, {{lang|sga|u}}-vowels that were later lost were short {{lang|cel-x-proto|u}} while those that remain were long {{lang|cel-x-proto|ū}}. The change operates after {{lang|sga|i}}-affection so original {{lang|cel-x-proto|e}} may end up as {{lang|sga|iu}}.

The result of {{lang|sga|i}}-affection and {{lang|sga|a}}-affection is that it is often impossible to distinguish whether the root vowel was originally {{lang|cel-x-proto|e}} or {{lang|cel-x-proto|i}} ({{lang|sga|sen}} &lt; {{lang|cel-x-proto|senos}} and {{lang|sga|fer}} &lt; {{lang|cel-x-proto|wiros}} have identical declensions). However, note the cases of {{lang|sga|nert}} vs. {{lang|sga|fiurt}} above for which {{lang|sga|i}}-affection, but not {{lang|sga|a}}-affection, was blocked by an intervening {{lang|sga|rt}}.

The Old Irish diphthongs {{lang|sga|úi}}, {{lang|sga|éu}}, {{lang|sga|íu}} stem from earlier sequences of short vowels separated by *{{lang|sga|w}}, e.g. {{lang|sga|drúid-}} "druid" &lt; {{lang|cel-x-proto|dru-wid-}} "tree-knower".

Most instances of {{lang|sga|é}} and {{lang|sga|ó}} in nonarchaic Old Irish are due to compensatory lengthening of short vowels before lost consonants or to the merging of two short vowels in [[hiatus (linguistics)|hiatus]]: {{lang|sga|cét}} {{IPA|/kʲeːd/}} ‘hundred’ &lt; Proto-Celtic {{lang|sga|kantom}} (cf. [[Welsh language|Welsh]] {{lang|cy|cant}}) &lt; PIE {{lang|cel-x-proto|kṃtóm}}.

=== PIE consonants ===

==== Overview ====
See [[Proto-Celtic]] for various changes that occurred in all the Celtic languages, but these are the most important:
* PIE {{lang|cel-x-proto|gʷ}} &gt; Proto-Celtic {{lang|cel-x-proto|b}} (but PIE {{lang|cel-x-proto|gʷʰ}} &gt; {{lang|cel-x-proto|gʷ}}).
* Loss of aspiration in {{lang|cel-x-proto|bʰ}} {{lang|cel-x-proto|dʰ}} {{lang|cel-x-proto|gʰ}} {{lang|cel-x-proto|gʷʰ}}.
* Loss of {{lang|cel-x-proto|p}}.&amp;nbsp;Initially and intervocalically it was simply deleted; elsewhere, it variously became {{lang|cel-x-proto|w}}, {{lang|cel-x-proto|b}}, {{lang|cel-x-proto|x}} etc.

From Proto-Celtic to Old Irish, the most important changes are these:
* Lenition and palatalisation, multiplying the entire set of consonants by 4. See [[#History]] for more details.
* Loss of most final consonants. See [[#Syncope in detail]].
* Proto-Celtic {{lang|cel-x-proto|s}} is lenited to {{IPA|/h/}}, which then disappears between vowels. In general, Old Irish {{lang|sga|s}} when not word-initial stems from earlier geminate {{lang|sga|ss}} (often still written as such, especially in archaic sources).
* Proto-Celtic {{lang|cel-x-proto|kʷ}} {{lang|cel-x-proto|gʷ}} remain in Ogam Irish ({{lang|pgl|{{sm|maqqi}}}} "son" (gen. sg.)) but become simple {{lang|sga|c g}} in Old Irish. Occasionally, they leave their mark by rounding the following vowel.
* Proto-Celtic {{lang|cel-x-proto|w}} is lost early on between vowels, followed by early hiatus resolution. In some cases, {{lang|cel-x-proto|w}} combines with a preceding vowel to form a diphthong: {{lang|sga|béu béo}} "living, alive" &lt; {{lang|cel-x-proto|bewas}} &lt; {{lang|cel-x-proto|biwos}} &lt; {{lang|cel-x-proto|gʷih₃uós}}.{{sfn|Thurneysen|1946|p=125}} Other instances of {{lang|cel-x-proto|w}} become {{IPA|[β]}}, which still remains in Ogam Irish. By Old Irish times, this becomes {{lang|sga|f-}} initially (e.g. {{lang|sga|fer}} "man" &lt; {{lang|cel-x-proto|wiros}}, {{lang|sga|flaith}} "lordship" &lt; {{lang|cel-x-proto|wlātis}}), lenited {{lang|sga|b}} after lenited voiced sounds (e.g. {{lang|sga|tarb}} "bull" &lt; {{lang|cel-x-proto|tarwos}}, {{lang|sga|fedb}} "widow" &lt; {{lang|cel-x-proto|widwā}}), {{lang|sga|f}} after lenited {{lang|cel-x-proto|s}} (lenited {{lang|sga|fïur}} "sister" &lt; {{lang|cel-x-proto|swesōr}}), and is lost otherwise (e.g. {{lang|sga|dáu}} "two" &lt; {{lang|cel-x-proto|dwōu}}, unlenited {{lang|sga|sïur}} "sister" &lt; {{lang|cel-x-proto|swesōr}}).
* Proto-Celtic {{lang|cel-x-proto|y}} becomes {{lang|cel-x-proto|iy}} after a consonant, much as in Latin. The vowel {{lang|cel-x-proto|i}} often survives before a lost final vowel, partly indicating the nature of the final vowel as a result of vowel affection: {{lang|sga|cride cridi cridiu}} "heart" (nom. gen. dat.) &lt; {{lang|cel-x-proto|kridion}} {{lang|cel-x-proto|kridiī}} {{lang|cel-x-proto|kridiū}} &lt; {{lang|cel-x-proto|kridiyom}} {{lang|cel-x-proto|kridiyī}} {{lang|cel-x-proto|kridiyū}} &lt; PIE {{lang|cel-x-proto|ḱr̥d-}} (e.g. gen. {{lang|cel-x-proto|ḱr̥d-és}}). After this, {{lang|cel-x-proto|y}} is lost everywhere (after palatalising a preceding consonant).

==== Initial clusters ====
Old Irish preserves, intact, most initial clusters unlike many other Indo-European languages.

Preserved initial clusters:{{sfn|Thurneysen|1946|pp=128–140}}
* {{lang|sga|sn- smr- sr- sl- sc- scr- scl-}}, e.g. {{lang|sga|snám}} "swimming", {{lang|sga|smiur}} "marrow", {{lang|sga|sruth}} "stream", {{lang|sga|scáth}} "shadow, reflection", {{lang|sga|scrissid}} "he scratches (out)", {{lang|sga|scléo}} "misery (?)".
* {{lang|sga|cr- cl- cn-}}, e.g. {{lang|sga|crú}} "blood", {{lang|sga|cloth}} "fame", {{lang|sga|cnú}} "nut".
* {{lang|sga|gr- gl- gn-}}, e.g. {{lang|sga|grían}} "sun", {{lang|sga|glé}} "clear", {{lang|sga|gnáth}} "customary".
* {{lang|sga|tr- tl- tn-}}, e.g. {{lang|sga|tromm}} "heavy', {{lang|sga|tlacht}} "garment", {{lang|sga|tnúth}} "jealousy, passion".
* {{lang|sga|dr- dl-}}, e.g. {{lang|sga|dringid}} "he climbs", {{lang|sga|dlong(a)id}} "he cleaves".
* {{lang|sga|mr- ml-}}, e.g. {{lang|sga|mruig}} "land", {{lang|sga|mliuchtae}} "milch".
* {{lang|sga|br- bl-}}, e.g. {{lang|sga|brú}} "belly", {{lang|sga|bláth}} "flower".

Modified initial clusters:{{sfn|Thurneysen|1946|pp=123–139}}
* {{lang|cel-x-proto|wl-}} {{lang|cel-x-proto|wr-}} &gt; {{lang|sga|fl- fr-}}, e.g. {{lang|sga|flaith}} "lordship" &lt; {{lang|cel-x-proto|wlātis}}, {{lang|sga|froích}} "heather" &lt; {{lang|cel-x-proto|wroikos}}.
* {{lang|cel-x-proto|sp-}}/{{lang|cel-x-proto|sw-}} &gt; {{lang|sga|s-}} (lenited {{lang|sga|f-}}), e.g. {{lang|sga|sïur}} "sister" (lenited {{lang|sga|fïur}}) &lt; {{lang|cel-x-proto|suior}} &lt; PIE {{lang|cel-x-proto|swesōr}}.
* {{lang|cel-x-proto|st-}} &gt; {{lang|sga|t-}}, e.g. {{lang|sga|tíagu}} "I go" &lt; {{lang|cel-x-proto|stēgū-s}} &lt; post-IE {{lang|cel-x-proto|steigʰō}}.
* {{lang|cel-x-proto|pl-}} {{lang|cel-x-proto|pr-}} lose the {{lang|cel-x-proto|p}}.
* PIE {{lang|cel-x-proto|gʷn-}} &gt; Proto-Celtic {{lang|cel-x-proto|bn-}} &gt; {{lang|sga|mn-}}, e.g. {{lang|sga|mná}} "woman" (gen. sg.) &lt; {{lang|cel-x-proto|bnās}} &lt; PIE {{lang|cel-x-proto|gʷneh₂s}}, an extremely archaic noun form.&lt;ref group=*&gt;Originally a neuter [[Proto-Indo-European nominals#Early PIE|proterokinetic]] noun of the form {{lang|cel-x-proto|gʷenh₂}} (nom. sg.), {{lang|cel-x-proto|gʷneh₂s}} (gen. sg.). The original PIE nominative is still preserved in poetic or legal Old Irish {{lang|sga|bé&lt;sup&gt;N&lt;/sup&gt;}} "woman" (still neuter!) &lt; Proto-Celtic {{lang|cel-x-proto|ben}} &lt; PIE {{lang|cel-x-proto|gʷenh₂}}. The normal Old Irish nominative is {{lang|sga|ben&lt;sup&gt;L&lt;/sup&gt;}} (feminine) &lt; Proto-Celtic {{lang|cel-x-proto|benā}} &lt; {{lang|cel-x-proto|ben}} + normal feminine *-ā. No other IE language preserves the original neuter gender.&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Intervocalic clusters ====
Many intervocalic clusters are reduced, becoming either a geminate consonant or a simple consonant with [[compensatory lengthening]] of the previous vowel. During the Old Irish period, geminates are reduced to simple consonants, occurring earliest when adjacent to a consonant. By the end of the Old Irish period, written {{lang|sga|ll mm nn rr}} are repurposed to indicate the non-lenited sounds {{IPA|/L m N R/}} when occurring after a vowel and not before a consonant.

Cluster reduction involving {{lang|cel-x-proto|n}}:
* {{lang|cel-x-proto|nt}} {{lang|cel-x-proto|nk}} &gt; unlenited {{IPA|/d g/}} (normally written {{lang|sga|t c}}). Note that PCelt {{lang|cel-x-proto|ant}},{{lang|cel-x-proto|ent}} &gt; {{lang|cel-x-proto|ent}} &gt; {{IPA|/eːd/}} but {{lang|cel-x-proto|int}} {{lang|cel-x-proto|ont}} {{lang|cel-x-proto|unt}} &gt; {{IPA|/idd odd udd/}} like  {{lang|cel-x-proto|nk}}: {{lang|sga|cét}} {{IPA|/kʲeːd/}} "hundred" &lt; PCelt {{lang|cel-x-proto|kantom}} (cf. [[Welsh language|Welsh]] {{lang|cy|cant}}) &lt; PIE {{lang|cel-x-proto|kṃtóm}}; {{lang|sga|sét}} {{IPA|/sʲeːd/}} "way" &lt; {{lang|cel-x-proto|sentu-}} (vs. [[Breton language|Breton]] {{lang|br|hent}}); {{lang|sga|ro·icc}}, {{lang|sga|ric(c)}} {{IPA|/r(o)-iɡɡ/}} "he reaches" &lt; {{lang|cel-x-proto|ro-ink-}} (vs. Bret {{lang|br|rankout}} "must, owe"); {{lang|sga|tocad}} {{IPA|/toɡað/}} "luck" (vs. Bret {{lang|br|tonkad}} "fate").{{sfn|Thurneysen|1946|pp=126–127}}
* {{lang|cel-x-proto|ns}} &gt; unlenited {{lang|sga|s}} with [[compensatory lengthening]] of a preceding vowel; {{lang|cel-x-proto|ans}} &gt; {{lang|cel-x-proto|ens}} &gt; {{lang|sga|és}} similarly to {{lang|cel-x-proto|ant}} {{lang|cel-x-proto|ank}}: {{lang|sga|géis}} "swan" &lt; PCelt {{lang|cel-x-proto|gansi-}} &lt; PIE {{lang|pgl|*ǵʰh₂ens-}} (vs. Dutch {{lang|nl|gans}} "goose").

Cluster reduction involving {{lang|cel-x-proto|s}} {{lang|cel-x-proto|z}}:
* Medial {{lang|cel-x-proto|sm}} {{lang|cel-x-proto|sn}} {{lang|cel-x-proto|sl}} &gt; {{lang|sga|mm nn ll}}: {{lang|sga|am(m)}} "I am" &lt; PIE {{lang|cel-x-proto|esmi}}.
* Medially, {{lang|cel-x-proto|st}} &gt; {{lang|sga|ss}} (but {{lang|cel-x-proto|str}} &gt; {{lang|sga|str}}, {{lang|cel-x-proto|rst}} &gt; {{lang|sga|rt}}).
* {{lang|cel-x-proto|zb}} &gt; {{lang|sga|db}} {{IPA|/ðv/}}, {{lang|cel-x-proto|zg}} &gt; {{lang|sga|dg}} {{IPA|/ðɣ/}} (but {{lang|sga|rg}} after an unstressed syllable), {{lang|cel-x-proto|zd}} &gt; {{IPA|/dd/}}: {{lang|sga|net}} {{IPA|/nedd/}} "nest" &lt; PIE {{lang|cel-x-proto|nisdos}} {{IPA|/nizdos/}}.

Lenited stops {{lang|cel-x-proto|x}} {{lang|pgl|*ɣ}} {{lang|pgl|*θ}} {{lang|pgl|*ð}} generally disappear before [[sonorant]]s {{lang|cel-x-proto|r}} {{lang|cel-x-proto|l}} {{lang|cel-x-proto|n}} {{lang|cel-x-proto|m}}, with [[compensatory lengthening]] of the preceding vowel. Many examples occur in reduplicated preterites or words with consonant-final prefixes (such as {{lang|sga|ad-}}):{{sfn|Thurneysen|1946|p=79}}
* {{lang|sga|du·air-chér}} "I have purchased" &lt; *-xexr &lt; PCelt *-kikra;
* {{lang|sga|·cúal(a)e}} "he heard" &lt; {{lang|cel-x-proto|koxlowe}} &lt; PCelt {{lang|cel-x-proto|kuklowe}};
* {{lang|sga|áram}} "number" &lt; {{lang|cel-x-proto|að-rīm}};
* {{lang|sga|ám thám}} "a moving to and fro" &lt; {{lang|cel-x-proto|aɣm}} θ-aɣm (verbal nouns of {{lang|sga|agid}} "he drives" and compound {{lang|sga|do·aig}});
* {{lang|sga|dál}} "assembly" &lt; {{lang|cel-x-proto|daθl}} (cf. Old Welsh {{lang|owl|datl}}).

However, {{lang|pgl|*θr}}, {{lang|pgl|*βr}}, {{lang|pgl|*βl}} survive: {{lang|sga|críathraid}} "he perforates" &lt; PCelt {{lang|cel-x-proto|krētrāti-s}}; {{lang|sga|gabur}} "goat" &lt; PCelt {{lang|cel-x-proto|gabros}} (cf. Welsh {{lang|cy|gafr}}); {{lang|sga|mebul}} "shame" (cf. Welsh {{lang|cy|mefl}}).

==Grammar==
{{main article|Old Irish grammar}}

Old Irish is a [[fusional language|fusional]], [[nominative-accusative language|nominative-accusative]], and [[verb-subject-object|VSO]] language.

Nouns [[declension|decline]] for 5 [[grammatical case|cases]]: [[nominative]], [[accusative]], [[genitive]], [[prepositional case|prepositional]], [[vocative]]; 3 [[grammatical gender|genders]]: masculine, feminine, neuter; 3 [[grammatical number|numbers]]: [[Grammatical number#Singular versus plural|singular]], [[Dual (grammatical number)|dual]], [[plural]]. [[Adjective]]s [[agreement (linguistics)|agree]] with nouns in [[grammatical case|case]], [[grammatical gender|gender]], and [[grammatical number|number]]. The [[prepositional case]] is called the [[dative]] by convention.

Verbs [[Grammatical conjugation|conjugate]] for 3 [[grammatical tense|tenses]]: [[past tense|past]], [[present tense|present]], [[future tense|future]]; 3 [[grammatical aspect|aspects]]: [[Uses of English verb forms#Simple|simple]], [[perfective aspect|perfective]], [[imperfective aspect|imperfective]]; 4 [[grammatical mood|moods]]: [[Grammatical mood#Indicative|indicative]], [[subjunctive mood|subjunctive]], [[conditional mood|conditional]], [[imperative mood|imperative]]; 2 [[grammatical voice|voices]]: [[active voice|active]], and [[passive voice|passive]]; [[Dependent and independent verb forms|independent]], and [[Dependent and independent verb forms|dependent]] forms; and [[Old Irish grammar#Independent and dependent forms|simple]], and [[Old Irish grammar#Independent and dependent forms|complex]] forms. Verbs display [[grammatical tense|tense]], [[grammatical aspect|aspect]], [[grammatical mood|mood]], [[grammatical voice|voice]], and sometimes [[portmanteau]] forms through [[suffix]]es, or [[word stem|stem]] vowel changes for the former four. [[Clitic#Proclitic|Proclitics]] form a verbal complex with the core verb, and the verbal complex is often preceded by preverbal [[Grammatical particle|particles]] such as {{lang|sga|ní}} (negative marker), {{lang|sga|in}} (interrogative marker), {{lang|sga|ro}} (perfective marker). [[Object (grammar)#Types of objects|Direct object]] [[personal pronoun]]s are [[infix]]ed between the [[preverb]] and the verbal [[word stem|stem]]. Verbs [[Agreement (linguistics)|agree]] with their [[Subject (grammar)|subject]] in [[grammatical number|person]] and [[grammatical number|number]]. A single verb can stand as an entire sentence. Emphatic particles such as -sa and -se are affixed to the end of the verb.

[[Preposition and postposition|Prepositions]] [[inflection|inflect]] for [[grammatical person|person]] and [[grammatical number|number]], and different prepositions [[Government (linguistics)|govern]] different [[grammatical cases|cases]], sometimes depending on the [[semantics]] intended.

'''''P.T.''''' (acronym for "playable teaser") is a [[First-person (video games)|first-person]] [[psychological horror]] [[video game]] developed by [[Kojima Productions]], under the pseudonym "7780s Studio", and published by [[Konami]]. The game was directed and designed by [[Hideo Kojima]], in collaboration with film director [[Guillermo Del Toro]].

Released for the [[PlayStation 4]] on 12 August 2014 as a free download on the [[PlayStation Network]], ''P.T.'' served primarily as an interactive [[Teaser campaign|teaser]] for the game ''[[Silent Hills]]'', a cancelled installment in the ''[[Silent Hill]]'' series. After the cancellation, Konami removed ''P.T.'' from the [[PlayStation Store]] and eliminated re-installing the game, a decision that later spawned criticism and fan efforts to allow ''P.T.'' to be re-downloaded.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Frank|first1=Allegra|title=You can re-download P.T., and here's how|url=http://www.polygon.com/2015/12/16/10296546/pt-hideo-kojima-silent-hills-re-download-ps4|website=Polygon|publisher=[[Vox Media Inc]]|accessdate=24 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''P.T.'' received critical acclaim for its direction, visuals, story complexity, and its supernatural horror tension build, but was both criticized and acclaimed for the puzzles and solutions.

Unlike the [[Virtual camera system#Third-person view|third-person perspective]] in ''Silent Hill'' games, ''P.T.'' uses a [[First-person (video games)|first-person perspective]],&lt;ref name="year"/&gt; which centers on an unknown protagonist, whom the player controls, who awakens in a haunted [[suburban]] house&lt;ref name="month"/&gt; and experiences supernatural occurrences.&lt;ref name="eurogamer"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2014-08-12-hideo-kojima-and-guillermo-del-toro-are-making-silent-hills|title=Hideo Kojima and Guillermo del Toro are making Silent Hills|date=13 August 2014|last=Matulef|first=Jeffrey|website=[[Eurogamer]]|publisher=Gamer Network Ltd.|accessdate=29 December 2014|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140814004128/http://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2014-08-12-hideo-kojima-and-guillermo-del-toro-are-making-silent-hills|archivedate=14 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Available areas to explore in the home consist of an L-shaped corridor with two rooms adjacent to it: a bathroom, and a staircase which leads to the room in which the player starts a loop, or a continuous reincarnation of the corridor.&lt;ref name="Lisa"/&gt;&lt;ref name="month"/&gt; The only actions the player can use are walking and zooming.&lt;ref name="year"/&gt; To progress, the player must investigate frightening events and solve cryptic puzzles.&lt;ref name="month"/&gt;&lt;ref name="GamesRadar"/&gt; Each time a loop is successfully completed, changes appear in the corridor.&lt;ref name="Lisa"/&gt; Additionally, the player encounters a hostile ghost named Lisa.&lt;ref name="Lisa"/&gt; If she catches the protagonist, the player has a random chance of triggering a startling [[jump scare]] when turning the camera horizontally and is sent back to the beginning of the current loop.&lt;ref name="Lisa"/&gt;

After the player solves the final puzzle, a cryptic and unrevealed puzzle that allows the player to escape, a trailer reveals that ''P.T.'' is a "playable teaser" for a new game in the ''Silent Hill'' series, called ''[[Silent Hills]]'', directed by [[Hideo Kojima]] and [[Guillermo del Toro]], with the protagonist portrayed by [[Norman Reedus]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ign.com/articles/2014/08/13/hideo-kojima-and-guillermo-del-toro-are-teaming-up-for-a-new-silent-hill|title=Hideo Kojima and Guillermo del Toro Are Teaming Up for a New Silent Hill|last=O'Brien|first=Lucy|website=[[IGN]]|publisher=[[j2 Global]]|accessdate=29 December 2014|date=12 August 2014|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140813091918/http://www.ign.com/articles/2014/08/13/hideo-kojima-and-guillermo-del-toro-are-teaming-up-for-a-new-silent-hill|archivedate=13 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Plot==
''P.T.'' centers on an unnamed protagonist who awakens in a concrete-lined room and opens a door to a haunted corridor,{{efn|The concept of being trapped in a home had been seen earlier in [[Silent Hill 4: The Room|the fourth installment of the ''Silent Hill'' series]]; its premise is that the protagonist Henry Townshend finds himself imprisoned in his apartment and unable to contact the outside world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gamesradar.com/loss-silent-hills-would-be-biggest-tragedy-kojimakonami-fallout-2/|title=The loss of Silent Hills would be the biggest tragedy of the Kojima/Konami fallout|date=27 April 2015|last=Laverde|first=Jake|website=[[GamesRadar]]|publisher=[[Future plc]]|accessdate=30 May 2015|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150531102524/http://www.gamesradar.com/loss-silent-hills-would-be-biggest-tragedy-kojimakonami-fallout-2/|archivedate=31 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Like ''P.T.'', it featured a first-person perspective when exploring Townshend's apartment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gameinformer.com/b/features/archive/2015/04/29/7440210.aspx?PostPageIndex=2|title=Ranking The Entire Silent Hill Series|page=2|last=Turi|first=Tim|date=28 April 2015|website=[[Game Informer]]|publisher=[[GameStop]]|accessdate=30 May 2015|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150702195500/http://www.gameinformer.com/b/features/archive/2015/04/29/7440210.aspx?PostPageIndex=2|archivedate=2 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;}} in which he can only walk through a hallway which continuously loops and redecorates itself. The first time he passes, a radio reports on a [[familicide]], which was committed by the father and later mentions two other cases exactly like it.&lt;ref name=Debate/&gt;&lt;!-- &lt;ref&gt;{{cite video game |title=P.T.

Later on, the protagonist encounters a hostile and unstable female apparition, presumably named Lisa. Upon entering the bathroom and being locked inside, he obtains a flashlight and finds a creature resembling an underdeveloped fetus crying in the sink.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Wilson|first1=Iain|title=P.T./Silent Hills demo walkthrough (Page 2)|url=http://www.gamesradar.com/pt-silent-hills-demo-walkthrough-guide/?page=2|website=[[GamesRadar]]|publisher=[[Future plc]]|accessdate=30 May 2015|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141229035731/http://www.gamesradar.com/pt-silent-hills-demo-walkthrough-guide/?page=2|archivedate=29 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Wilson|first1=Iain|title=P.T./Silent Hills demo walkthrough (Page 3)|url=http://www.gamesradar.com/pt-silent-hills-demo-walkthrough-guide/?page=3|website=[[GamesRadar]]|publisher=[[Future plc]] |accessdate=30 May 2015|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150101192022/http://www.gamesradar.com/pt-silent-hills-demo-walkthrough-guide/?page=3|archivedate=1 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; He soon gets out but finds out that the apparition is watching him. While it is possible to avoid the ghost completely, if the protagonist is attacked by the ghost he reawakens in the first room of the game, beginning the loop again. In this room there is a bloody moving [[paper bag]] that speaks to him, telling him of a disturbing experience and stating the same quote seen at the start of the game: "Watch out. The gap in the door... it's a separate reality. The only me is me. Are you sure the only you is you?"

The next few loops feature a refrigerator hanging from the ceiling, leaking blood. The muffled sound of a hysterically crying baby can be heard from the refrigerator, which violently shakes and moves. This happens several times, each time being more severe than the last. As it{{Clarify|reason=What is "it"? What transitions?|date=September 2018}} transitions, the radio issues a Swedish message referencing the 1938 radio drama ''[[The War of the Worlds (radio drama)|The War of the Worlds]]''. In the next loop, the lamps turn completely red, the player's vision blurs, the character moves abnormally quickly, and there is a set of disturbing illusions. Eventually, the protagonist listens to a murder being committed in the bathroom through the bathroom peephole. After the audio{{Clarify|reason=Which audio? Has the Swedish audio been playing through these loops as well?|date=September 2018}} ends, the bathroom door opens by itself and the player enters upon the fetus-like creature telling the protagonist that ten months earlier, he lost his job and turned to [[alcoholism]]. His wife then worked as a part-time cashier job to financially support the family, but the manager was sexually attracted to her, implying a motive for the familicide.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite video game |title=P.T. (Silent Hills Playable Teaser) |developer=7780s Studio |publisher=[[Konami]] |date=12 August 2014 |platform=[[PlayStation 4]] |scene= |level=The bathroom |quote='''Fetus''': You got fired, so you drowned your sorrows in booze. She had to get a part-time job working a grocery store cash register. Only reason she could earn a wage at all, is the manager liked how she looked in a skirt. You remember, right? Exactly ten months back.}}&lt;/ref&gt; The corridor then corrects itself and the protagonist eventually hears a voice uttering "204863" repeatedly. The player's perspective distorts, and the game displays a false [[Crash (computing)|crash message]].

When the game is restarted, the protagonist awakens in the beginning room and continues the loop with only the flashlight as a light source. He discovers the torn pieces of a photograph scattered throughout the hall and reassembles it in its frame. After the picture is completed and a set of tasks are done, a telephone rings and the radio's voice says "You've been chosen." The protagonist sees a door unlock and leaves the building.

In the subsequent [[cutscene]], the radio's voice remarks about having lived a life of regularity until his father killed him and his family without any creativity; he then voices his intention to return with his "new toys".&lt;ref name=Debate/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Wilson|first1=Iain|title=P.T./Silent Hills demo walkthrough (Page 5)|url=http://www.gamesradar.com/pt-silent-hills-demo-walkthrough-guide/?page=5|website=[[GamesRadar]]|publisher=[[Future plc]]|accessdate=30 May 2015|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150530224805/http://www.gamesradar.com/pt-silent-hills-demo-walkthrough-guide/?page=5|archivedate=30 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite video game |title=P.T.

I ''will'' be coming back, and I'm bringing my new toys with me.}}&lt;/ref&gt; The protagonist steps out into the streets of a deserted city and is revealed to be portrayed by [[Norman Reedus]]. The credits then reveal the nature of the Playable Teaser.

==Development==
[[File:Hideo Kojima 20100702 Japan Expo 1.jpg|thumb|right|[[Hideo Kojima]], the designer of ''P.T.'']]
[[Kojima Productions]] used their [[game engine]], the [[Fox Engine]], to develop ''P.T.''.&lt;ref name="Kojima Productions"/&gt;&lt;ref name=unknown/&gt; Hideo Kojima's intention when creating ''P.T.'' was to scare people in a unique way, as well as to deliver an interactive teaser experience instead of releasing trailers and [[screenshot]]s of ''Silent Hills''.&lt;ref name=unknown/&gt;

===Game design===
''P.T.'' was designed to take players at least a week to complete, and Kojima intended the puzzles to be very enigmatic and difficult.&lt;ref name="eurogamer"/&gt; Despite this, a few gamers reportedly finished the game within hours after the release, surprising him.&lt;ref name="eurogamer"/&gt;&lt;ref name=Verge2&gt;{{cite web|last1=Grant|first1=Christopher|title=Why 'P.T.' is more exciting than 'Silent Hills,' and the future of the video game demo 'P.T.' |url=https://www.theverge.com/2014/8/21/6039889/why-pt-is-more-exciting-than-silent-hills-and-the-future-of-the-video-game-demo|website=[[The Verge]]|publisher=[[Vox Media]]|accessdate=22 May 2015|date=21 August 2014|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140822100227/http://www.theverge.com/2014/8/21/6039889/why-pt-is-more-exciting-than-silent-hills-and-the-future-of-the-video-game-demo|archivedate=21 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Kojima also intended for ''P.T.'' to be a mystery in order to make it a more frightening experience. There is little, if not cryptic, information given in the game on events that take place, and there are few clues as to how to solve the puzzles.&lt;ref name=unknown&gt;{{cite web|last1=Coskrey|first1=Jason|title=Kojima's terrifying world of the unknown|url=http://www.japantimes.co.jp/life/2014/09/26/digital/kojimas-terrifying-world-unknown/#.VVuhd_lVikr|website=[[The Japan Times]]|publisher=The Japan Times, Ltd|accessdate=19 May 2015|date= 26 September 2014|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150322074611/http://www.japantimes.co.jp/life/2014/09/26/digital/kojimas-terrifying-world-unknown/#.VZWcQvlVikr|archivedate=22 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; He chose the corridor as the setting as opposed to "a ruin" because he wanted the teaser to emotionally affect the player regardless of "cultural background".&lt;ref name="Horror"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://kotaku.com/hideo-kojima-and-shinji-mikami-talk-horror-games-1641562015 | title=Hideo Kojima and Shinji Mikami Talk Horror Games | website=[[Kotaku]] |publisher=[[Gawker Media]] |accessdate=29 April 2015 | last=Nakamura | first=Toshi|date=2 October 2014|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150507182010/http://kotaku.com/hideo-kojima-and-shinji-mikami-talk-horror-games-1641562015|archivedate=7 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Kojima elaborated that ''P.T.'' and ''Silent Hills'' have no canonical and direct relation, and that ''Silent Hills'' would have been enhanced by elements that were never in ''P.T.''&lt;ref name=unknown/&gt; He based his concept of ''P.T.'' on [[horror film]]s and other media that he found frightening.&lt;ref name=unknown/&gt; When creating the game, Kojima refrained from using [[graphic violence]] to build up suspense, as he felt that too many [[Horror fiction|horror]] games rely on the trope. He wanted to elicit a more "genuine, thoughtful and permeating" type of fear.&lt;ref name=unknown/&gt;

Erik Kain of ''[[Forbes]]'' enjoyed the game for its anxiety-inducing horror, and wrote that it succeeded as marketing for the upcoming ''Silent Hills''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Kain|first1=Erik|title=Hideo Kojima's 'P.T.

''P.T.'' was also placed on some "best-of" lists in 2014.

==Themes and analysis==
[[File:P.T. Baby.jpg|thumb|left|Danielle Riendeau from ''[[Polygon (website)|Polygon]]'' compared ''P.T.''{{'}}s fetus in the sink (pictured) to the deformed baby in [[David Lynch]]'s film ''[[Eraserhead]]'' (1977).&lt;ref name=Eraserhead/&gt;]]

Reviewers have identified several themes in ''P.T.'' According to ''[[Eurogamer]]''{{'}}s Jeffrey Matulef, the game's main theme is "cyclical mental anguish", supported by the obscure and confusing nature of the puzzles.&lt;ref name="Eurogamer"/&gt; Danielle Riendeau of ''[[Polygon (website)|Polygon]]'' wrote that ''P.T.'' uses two primary themes from the ''Silent Hill'' series, "a sense of family trauma and domestic violence and the duality of the 'real world' and the nightmare world."&lt;ref name=Eraserhead/&gt; She suggested that ''P.T.'' and ''[[Eraserhead]]'' shared thematic content, writing that both included a crying, deformed infant and that the film's protagonist journeyed from reality into a terrifying world.&lt;ref name=Eraserhead&gt;{{cite web|last1=Riendeau|first1=Danielle|title=Silent Hills 'pants soiling' scares won't measure up to P.T.|url=http://www.polygon.com/2014/8/18/6033001/silent-hills-pt-horror-films|website=[[Polygon (website)|Polygon]]|publisher=[[Vox Media]] |accessdate=20 May 2015|date=18 August 2014|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150528220622/http://www.polygon.com/2014/8/18/6033001/silent-hills-pt-horror-films|archivedate=28 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''P.T.''{{'}}s ceaselessly looping hallway has been a source of critical discussion. Rob Crossley of GameSpot wrote that it induced "mild [[claustrophobia]]" and "a familiarity with your surroundings". He remarked that while the length of the first part of the corridor worked to create tension, the design of the second part intentionally prevented the player from being able to keep everything in view, causing the player to feel vulnerable.&lt;ref name="Kojima Productions"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.gamespot.com/articles/in-memory-of-the-unbearable-enigma-p-t/1100-6426967/ | title=In Memory of the Unbearable Enigma, P.T. | website=[[GameSpot]] |publisher=[[CBS Interactive]] |accessdate=18 May 2015 | last=Crossley | first=Rob}}&lt;/ref&gt; David Houghton of GamesRadar described the looping corridor as "the conduit for everything that it builds", along with saying that "it fills that structure with an unbroken feedback loop of 'horror' ... every time you leave is a monumental relief, and every simultaneous instance of returning is a moment of primal foreboding at how things might, and almost certainly will, escalate, compounded by the knowledge of the seemingly countless iterations before." Houghton felt that the game understood how to evoke horror by working "within the realm of [[psychology]]".&lt;ref name="GamesRadar"/&gt; ''Polygon'' quoted a game player who said that "''P.T.''{{'}}s greatest asset is its looping hallway", elaborating that it not only invokes fear, but also "curiosity, or a desire to know what will happen next".&lt;ref name=YouTube&gt;{{cite web|last1=Riendeau|first1=Danielle|title=Why we can't stop talking about P.T.|url=http://www.polygon.com/2014/10/3/6904453/p-t-silent-hills-kojima|website=[[Polygon (website)|Polygon]]|publisher=[[Vox Media]]|accessdate=21 May 2015|date=3 October 2014|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150612214808/http://www.polygon.com/2014/10/3/6904453/p-t-silent-hills-kojima|archivedate=12 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Matulef said that the claustrophobic and repetitive environment displayed in the game can hypnotize the player into a sense of vulnerability.&lt;ref name=Eurogamer/&gt;

The majority of what is said and depicted in the game is open to interpretation, leading fans to develop and discuss theories about the nature of the events that occur in the game.&lt;ref name=theory&gt;{{cite web|last1=Hernandez|first1=Patricia|title=The Next Silent Hill Already Has Bonkers Fan Theories|url=http://kotaku.com/the-next-silent-hill-already-has-bonkers-fan-theories-1621737836|website=[[Kotaku]]|publisher=[[Gawker Media]] |accessdate=3 June 2015|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150603150006/http://kotaku.com/the-next-silent-hill-already-has-bonkers-fan-theories-1621737836|archivedate=3 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Hernandez|first1=Patricia|title=Wow, People Are Still Coming Up With Wild Silent Hills Theories|url=http://kotaku.com/wow-people-are-still-coming-up-with-wild-silent-hills-1637043267|website=[[Kotaku]]|publisher=[[Gawker Media]]|accessdate=2 July 2015|date=19 September 2014|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150603150002/http://kotaku.com/wow-people-are-still-coming-up-with-wild-silent-hills-1637043267|archivedate=3 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Let's Play (video gaming)|Let's Players]] Voidburger and Bob from the video-game related podcast ''The Grate Debate'' opined that the open-ended nature of the game is one of its greatest aspects.&lt;ref name=YouTube/&gt; They also said that there may be something in the game that has not been discovered yet. They noted the colored lights as something they still had not figured out,&lt;ref name=YouTube/&gt; and they felt that the game hinted that the radio may be the main culprit behind the father's killing.&lt;ref name=Debate/&gt; The game also contained a Swedish line in the radio describing a radio drama from 1938 being true, which gamers suggested may be a nod to [[Orson Welles]]'s radio adaptation of ''[[The War of the Worlds (radio drama)|The War of the Worlds]]''.&lt;ref name=Debate/&gt;&lt;ref name=WOFW&gt;{{cite web|last1=McWhertor|first1=Michael|title=P.T.'s secret radio transmissions may point to a returning Silent Hill tradition|url=http://www.polygon.com/2014/8/20/6049367/pt-radio-transmissions-translation-silent-hills|website=[[Polygon (website)|Polygon]]|publisher=[[Vox Media]] |accessdate=2 June 2015|date=20 August 2014|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150522174054/http://www.polygon.com/2014/8/20/6049367/pt-radio-transmissions-translation-silent-hills|archivedate=22 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; This possible reference to alien invasions was noted as a continuation of a ''Silent Hill'' tradition of having secret endings that included aliens.&lt;ref name=WOFW/&gt; Another theory commonly discussed is deciphering the identity of the player character.&lt;ref name=theory/&gt; The fetus talking to the player character about his remembering moments "ten months back" seems to imply that he is the father who killed Lisa and the kids, although Voidburger and Bob believe that the player character may be the protagonist that was to be in ''Silent Hills'', as shown in the trailer following the ending of ''P.T.''&lt;ref name=Debate/&gt;

Journalists have expressed confusion about whether the game should be described as a teaser, video game, or demo.&lt;ref name="Giant Bomb"/&gt;&lt;ref name=Grant/&gt; Despite ongoing debate, the game won awards for best trailer while also winning game of the month and best horror game of the year awards.&lt;ref name="trailer"/&gt;&lt;ref name="year"/&gt;&lt;ref name="month"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Kojima Productions"/&gt; While naming ''P.T.'' as an honorable mention for best trailer, Marty Sliva from [[IGN]] felt that ''P.T.'' was more of an "interactive experimental film/[[puzzle game]]".&lt;ref name="trailer"/&gt; "[[Technology demonstration|Demo]]" has been one of the more common descriptions,&lt;ref name=Eraserhead/&gt;&lt;ref name=YouTube/&gt; though [[GameSpot]] was reluctant to categorize it as such.&lt;ref name="month"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Kojima Productions"/&gt; Despite it being commonly called a demo of ''Silent Hills'', there is no evidence that it was going to be a part of ''Silent Hills'' aside from the reveal of the trailer and title after the end of the game.&lt;ref name="Kojima Productions"/&gt; Hideo Kojima himself explained that it was not a demo of ''Silent Hills'' and described it as a "teaser" in a [[Twitter|tweet]].&lt;ref name=unknown/&gt;&lt;ref name=Verge2/&gt;

Patrick Klepek from ''[[Kotaku]]'' stated  "It's fine that Konami doesn't want to make ''Silent Hills''" but that the deletion of ''P.T.'' was wrong since the demo had become part of gaming culture.&lt;ref name="Konami"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://kotaku.com/konami-sucks-1702695162 | title=Konami Sucks | website=[[Kotaku]] | publisher= [[Gawker Media]] | accessdate=18 May 2015 | last=Klepek | first=Patrick|date=6 May 2015|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150518121636/http://kotaku.com/konami-sucks-1702695162|archivedate=18 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nick Robinson of ''[[Polygon (website)|Polygon]]'' described Konami's removal as the "most irresponsible, cowardly decision possible", but that the subsequent unavailability had also made the demo "one of the coolest, most fascinating games in the history of our medium".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.polygon.com/2015/5/7/8564283/opinion-konami-pt-removal-just-made-p-t-one-of-the-greatest-games-of-all-time | title=Konami accidentally just made P.T. the coolest game of all time | website=[[Polygon (website)|Polygon]] | publisher=[[Vox Media]] | accessdate=18 May 2015 | last=Robinson | first=Nick|date=7 May 2015|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150519054646/http://www.polygon.com/2015/5/7/8564283/opinion-konami-pt-removal-just-made-p-t-one-of-the-greatest-games-of-all-time|archivedate=19 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; After the cancellation, [[PlayStation 4]] consoles with P.T. installed were listed on [[eBay]] for over $1000;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.vg247.com/2015/04/29/ps4-with-silent-hills-demo-p-t-installed-listed-for-1000-on-ebay/ | title=PS4 with Silent Hills demo P.T. installed listed for £1000 on eBay | website=[[VG247]] | accessdate=18 May 2015 | last=Saed | first=Sherif|date=29 April 2015|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150519145916/http://www.vg247.com/2015/04/29/ps4-with-silent-hills-demo-p-t-installed-listed-for-1000-on-ebay/|archivedate=19 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; eBay later pulled the auctions down.&lt;ref name="eBay"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://kotaku.com/ebay-taking-down-auctions-selling-ps4s-with-p-t-1702917689 | title=eBay Taking Down Auctions Selling PS4's with ''P.T.'' | website=[[Kotaku]] | publisher=[[Gawker Media]] | accessdate=18 May 2015 | last=Klepek | first=Patrick|date=7 May 1015|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150518125023/http://kotaku.com/ebay-taking-down-auctions-selling-ps4s-with-p-t-1702917689|archivedate=18 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.digitaltrends.com/gaming/playstation-4-pt-silent-hills-ebay/ | title=eBay sellers charging over $1,000 for PlayStation 4 with Silent Hills PT demo installed | website=[[Digital Trends]] | accessdate=18 May 2015 | last=Wouk | first=Kristofer|date=9 May 2015|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150522015701/http://www.digitaltrends.com/gaming/playstation-4-pt-silent-hills-ebay/|archivedate=22 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The incident has been compared to the mass selling of [[iPhone]]s containing ''[[Flappy Bird]]'' after that game's removal from the [[App Store (iOS)|iOS App Store]].&lt;ref name="eBay"/&gt; [[Guillermo del Toro]], the intended future director of ''Silent Hills'', commented on ''P.T.''{{'}}s popularity, speculating that there were people who still have a passion for the ''Silent Hill'' series.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/05/15/guillermo-del-toro-laments-what-silent-hills-couldve-been | title=Guillermo Del Toro Laments What Silent Hills Could've Been | website=[[IGN]] | publisher=[[j2 Global]] | accessdate=19 May 2015 | last=Krupa |first=Daniel|date=15 May 2015|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150529141818/http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/05/15/guillermo-del-toro-laments-what-silent-hills-couldve-been|archivedate=29 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''P.T.'' has also been alluded to in other video games. The antagonist, Lisa, made a [[Cameo appearance|cameo]] in another video game directed by Kojima, ''[[Metal Gear Solid V: The Phantom Pain]]'' (2015).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Fahey|first1=Mike|title=P.T.'s Unfriendly Ghost Pops Up In Metal Gear Solid V|url=http://kotaku.com/p-t-s-unfriendly-ghost-pops-up-in-metal-gear-solid-v-1637422072|website=[[Kotaku]]| publisher=[[Gawker Media]] |accessdate=21 May 2015|date=21 September 2014|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150702181958/http://kotaku.com/p-t-s-unfriendly-ghost-pops-up-in-metal-gear-solid-v-1637422072|archivedate=2 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The radio monologue from the beginning of P.T. can also be found playing on a radio as an easter egg. Additionally, the first-person survival-horror video game ''[[Allison Road (video game)|Allison Road]]'' was heavily inspired by ''P.T.''
''Allison Road'' is to take place in a haunted [[townhouse]] in the United Kingdom and feature a male protagonist who attempts to unravel the mystery behind his missing family over five nights.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.polygon.com/2015/7/1/8876559/allison-road-pt-horror|title=P.T.-like horror game Allison Road is creepy, creepy, creepy and we love it|author=Farokhmanesh, Megan|date=1 July 2015|work=[[Polygon (website)|Polygon]]|publisher=[[Vox Media]]|accessdate=3 July 2015|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150702151015/http://www.polygon.com/2015/7/1/8876559/allison-road-pt-horror|archivedate=2 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the demo, some wall graffiti directly alludes to ''P.T.'' by repeating a statement made in the game.&lt;ref name="Allison Road Kotaku"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Hernandez|first1=Patricia|title=Fans Are Making A Spiritual Successor To P.T., And It Looks Terrifying|url=http://kotaku.com/fans-are-making-a-spiritual-successor-to-p-t-and-it-l-1715045419|website=[[Kotaku]]|publisher=[[Gawker Media]] |accessdate=2 July 2015|date=30 June 2015|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150701112714/http://kotaku.com/fans-are-making-a-spiritual-successor-to-p-t-and-it-l-1715045419|archivedate=1 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[The Park (video game)|The Park]]'', a spin-off game from ''[[The Secret World]]'', has a sequence inspired by ''P.T.'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Whitehead|first1=Dan|title=The Park review|url=http://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2015-10-29-the-park-review|website=[[Eurogamer]]|publisher=Gamer Network|accessdate=31 October 2015|date=29 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Cork|first1=Jeff|title=The Park Review|url=http://www.gameinformer.com/games/the_park/b/pc/archive/2015/10/28/the-park-review-a-short-and-unnerving-ride.aspx|website=[[Game Informer]]|publisher=[[GameStop]]|accessdate=31 October 2015|date=28 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the horror games ''[[Layers of Fear]]'' and ''[[Visage (video game)|Visage]]'' were heavily inspired by ''P.T.'' as well.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Layers of Fear: Dev laments Konami's Silent Hills PT cancellation|first=Anthony|last=Chapman|website=''[[Sunday Express]]''|url=http://www.express.co.uk/entertainment/gaming/639998/Layers-Of-Fear-PS4-Silent-Hills-PT-Konami-Cancelltion|accessdate=13 March 2016|date=1 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Guarino |first=Mike |url=http://attackofthefanboy.com/news/new-horror-game-kickstarter-visage-inspired-p-t-silent-hill/ |title=New Horror Game Kickstarter Visage Inspired By P.T.

In February 2016, the YouTube channel known collectively as "Oddest of the Odd", released a [[short film]] titled "Silent Hills P.T. in real life". The film draws heavily from its source material, as an unseen protagonist explores a two-story hallway loop in the first person camera perspective. The short film was featured by IGN describing it as "incredible" while GameRant's Alexander Pan described the video as being "complete with the demo's much-touted disturbing content and eerie atmosphere."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Silent Hills’ P.T.

''[[Resident Evil 7: Biohazard]]'' was also compared with ''P.T.'' during its announcement at [[E3 2016]] thanks in part to the Beginning Hour Demo, its first-person perspective, and its photo-realistic graphics. Jordan Amaro, the level designer of ''Silent Hills'' was responsible for the creation of ''Resident Evil 7''{{'}}s design and setting&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gamespot.com/articles/resident-evil-7-goes-back-to-horror-roots-will-be-/1100-6439896/|title=Resident Evil 7 Goes Back to Horror Roots, Will Be Announced at E3 - Analyst|date=17 May 2016|accessdate=30 April 2017|website=gamespot.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;, although he has denied that his work on ''Resident Evil 7'' was influenced by ''P.T.'', claiming that he "wasn’t part of the core team of ''P.T.''" and that "''Silent Hills'' would have been quite different from ''Resident Evil 7'' anyway"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/glixel/features/splatoon-2-hideo-kojima-nintendo-japanese-games-w501322/|title=Nintendo Dev On Working With Kojima,'Splatoon 2,' Rise of Japanese Games - Rolling Stone|date=6 September 2017|accessdate=13 November 2017|website=rollingstone.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 4 July 2018, Qimsar, a 17-year-old developer and fan of P.T., remade the playable teaser for the PC and released it for free.&lt;ref&gt;Frank, Allegra.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7210">'''Philosophy of sport''' is an area of [[philosophy]] that seeks to conceptually analyze issues of sport as human activity. These issues cover many areas, but fall primarily into five philosophical categories: metaphysics, ethics and moral philosophy, philosophy of law, political philosophy, and aesthetics. The philosophical perspective on sport originated in Ancient Greece, having experienced a revival in the latter part of the 20th century&lt;ref name= "Reid"&gt;{{cite book

A philosophical perspective on sports incorporates its metaphysical relationships with art and play, ethical issues of virtue and fairness and more broadly sociopolitical.&lt;ref name="Reid" /&gt;

==Sport and philosophy in ancient Greece==

Ancient Greece is considered the birthplace of both [[ancient philosophy]] and [[Olympic sport]]. Hellenistic philosophies hung great significance on athletic performance. A leader's athletic prowess, according to the view of the times, reflected their ability to lead.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=http://www.cambridgescholars.com/download/sample/59965 |title=Philosophy of Sport|editor1 = Hardman, Alun |editor2=Jones, Carwyn |isbn=1-4438-2516-6|year=2010|publisher=Cambridge Scholars Publishing}}&lt;/ref&gt; (Games of the [[Phaeacians]] in [[Homer]]'s ''[[Odyssey]]'') Sport was seen as an [[epistemic]] inquiry, a methodological process by which we learn the objective truth of a person's athletic potential by actualizing it in athletic competition. Athletics as a measure of individual worth was seen as a cure to social inequality. Sport was even seen as moral education, with Plato advocating the participation of women in sport for their moral enrichment. Aristotle emphasized physical activity as an ethical responsibility. Mentions of sport were also found in the work of [[Plato]].&lt;ref name="Reid" /&gt;

==Contemporary philosophy of sport==

The resurgence of interest in philosophy of sport was marked by Yale philosopher [[Paul Weiss (philosopher)|Paul Weiss]]' book publication ''Sport: A Philosophical Inquiry (1969)'', considered the first book-length text in philosophy of sport. In it, Weiss explains the dearth of work in philosophy of sport as a reflection of academic elitism. Sport was always considered vulgar or common, according to Weiss.&lt;ref&gt;Shouler, Kenneth (2003) [http://philosophynow.org/issues/41/If_Life_is_Finite_Why_am_I_Watching_this_Damn_Game If Life is Finite, Why am I Watching this Damn Game?] ''Philosophy Now''&lt;/ref&gt;

Long before this, however, philosophical considerations of sport and physical and activity were discussed as a subset of educational reform in the late 19th century as the link between physical education and health and well-being gained appreciation among scholars. To many of the time, the health and educational benefits of physical activity were a component of public life. Inadvertently, many non-philosopher proponents of physical education took on philosophical positions on teleology, mind-body dualism and metaphysics as part of their model of human agency and personhood. In a broader context, political philosophy entered the picture as thinkers of the time, in response to pressing social and political issues of the day associated civic duty, responsible citizenship and other political features to sport.&lt;ref name="Kretchmar" /&gt; While much of the focus has been on the work done in the West, philosophers of sport acknowledge the importance of work done in the East, particularly Japan.&lt;ref name="heacademy.ac.uk"&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20090206052502/http://www.heacademy.ac.uk/assets/hlst/documents/resources/philosophy_ethics_sport.pdf Resource Guide to the Philosophy of Sport and Ethics of Sport]. Hospitality, Leisure, Sport and Tourism Network, October 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

Important questions in philosophy of sport are concerned with the social virtues of sport, the aesthetics of sporting performances and display, the epistemology of individual and team strategy and techniques, sporting ethics, the logic of rules in sport, metaphysics of sport as a component of human nature or instinct, etc.&lt;ref name="heacademy.ac.uk"/&gt; However, some writers have composed a philosophy of sport in terms of the body, art and its intersections with generation X sports, such as bouldering, surfing, skateboarding.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Sanzaro, Francis |title=The Boulder: A Philosophy for Bouldering|isbn=0954877993}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other areas of intersection with contemporary areas of philosophy include [[philosophy of education]], [[philosophy of law]], [[philosophy of mind]], philosophy of rules, [[philosophy of science]], [[social philosophy]] and [[political philosophy]].

==Issues in philosophy of sport==

===Ethics===
Ethical issues in philosophy of sport predominantly center on athlete behavior in relation to rules of the game, other athletes, spectators, external factors such as socioeconomic issues among supporters and communities, and issues of doping.

Issues of [[doping in sport]] focus on the ethics of medical intervention on athletic performance: what is acceptable versus what is not, and how boundaries can be drawn. Particular attention is given to the question of what factors ought to be taken into consideration when banning certain medical interventions.

These and other issues are usually compared and contrasted through the lenses of three significant moral theories: [[consequentialism]], [[deontology]] and [[virtue ethics]].&lt;ref&gt;McNamee, Mike.

{{Infobox animanga/Footer}}

{{nihongo|'''''Psycho-Pass'''''|サイコパス|Saiko Pasu|lead=yes}} is a Japanese [[cyberpunk]] [[anime]] television series produced by [[Production I.G]]. It was co-directed by Naoyoshi Shiotani and [[Katsuyuki Motohiro]] and written by [[Gen Urobuchi]], with character designs by [[Akira Amano]] featuring music by [[Yugo Kanno]]. The original Japanese cast includes [[Kana Hanazawa]] as [[Akane Tsunemori]], [[Tomokazu Seki]] as [[Shinya Kogami]], and [[Takahiro Sakurai]] as [[Shogo Makishima]]. The series was aired on [[Fuji TV]]'s [[Noitamina]] programming block between October 2012 and March 2013. A second season began airing in October 2014, with an [[Psycho-Pass: The Movie|animated film]] released in January 2015. In 2018, it received a new anime, along with a compilation film trilogy from January to March 2019. The story takes place in an authoritarian future [[dystopia]], where omnipresent public sensors continuously scan the mental states of every passing citizen. 

''Psycho-Pass'' originated from Production I.G.'s interest in making a successor to [[Mamoru Oshii]]'s achievements. The series was inspired by several live-action films. Chief director Katsuyuki Motohiro aimed to explore psychological themes in society's youth using dystopian storylines. Multiple books and movies influenced ''Psycho-Pass'' with the most notable being the 1982 American [[science fiction film]] ''[[Blade Runner]]''. The series was licensed by [[Funimation]] in North America.  A [[manga]] adaptation has been in serialization in [[Shueisha]]'s ''[[Jump Square]]'' magazine and several novels, including an adaptation and prequels to the original story, have been published. An episodic video game adaptation called ''Chimi Chara Psycho-Pass'' was developed by [[Nitroplus]] Staffers in collaboration with Production I.G. New novels and another manga were serialized in 2014.

The first anime, ''Psycho-Pass'', has garnered critical acclaim in both Japan and the west with critics praising the characters' roles and interactions set in the dystopia. The animation has also been praised despite issues in latter episodes which required fixing in the DVD volumes of the series. On the other hand, the second series, ''Psycho-Pass 2'', received mixed critical response stemming from its heavy use of gore as well as the new villain.

==Plot==

===Setting===
''Psycho-Pass'' is set in a futuristic era in Japan where the {{nihongo|Sibyl System|シビュラシステム|Shibyura Shisutemu}}, a powerful network of psychometric scanners, actively measures the minds and mentalities of civilised populations using a "cymatic scan" of the brain. The resulting assessment is called a {{nihongo|Psycho-Pass|サイコパス|Saikopasu}}. When the calculated likelihood of an individual committing a crime, measured by the {{nihongo|Crime Coefficient|犯罪係数|Hanzaikeisū}} index, exceeds an accepted threshold, he or she is pursued, apprehended, and killed if necessary by police forces. Elite officers labelled "Enforcers" are equipped with large handguns called "Dominators"{{mdash}}special weapons that only activate when aimed at suspects with higher-than-acceptable Crime Coefficients. Enforcers are themselves selected for innately high Crime Coefficients, marking them as "latent criminals"; they are overseen by police Inspectors, who have the jurisdiction to shoot them with their Dominators should they pose a danger to the public.

===Story===
{{main article|List of Psycho-Pass characters}}
The series starts with [[Shinya Kogami]], an Enforcer under Akane's watch during her first mission. [[Akane Tsunemori]] is a new police Inspector at Unit One of the Public Safety Bureau's Criminal Investigation Division. Akane is ashamed of shooting Kogami under her watch during her first mission when she judges him a threat to an apprehended criminal's life. Kogami thanks her for intervening in what could've been a murder, which influences Akane to stay. She is accompanied by veteran Inspector Nobuchika Ginoza, a strict man who looks down on Enforcers; Tomomi Masaoka, a middle-aged Enforcer who used to be a detective; Shusei Kagari, a carefree young man who was marked as a latent criminal in childhood; and Yayoi Kunizuka, a former musician turned into a latent criminal stemming from a relationship with a terrorist. Over the course of Akane's early investigations, the group uncovers the works of Shogo Makishima, a prolific criminal mastermind. Makishima is a {{nihongo|Criminally Asymptomatic|免罪体質|Menzai Taishitsu}} – he is persistently assessed as having a low crime coefficient by the Sybil System in spite of his actions and plans, thus protecting him from Dominator shots.

The Enforcers and Inspectors start hunting Makishima, who aims to destroy the society created by the Sybil System. To do this he causes riots in the city to draw the police away from the Health and Welfare Ministry's Nona Tower facility, where Sibyl is located. Akane and Kogami stop Makishima's forces while Enforcer Shūsei Kagari follows one of Makishima's allies to the tower where Bureau Chief Joshu Kasei kills Makishima's ally and Kagari to keep the true form of Sibyl a secret. Kasei tells Makishima that Sibyl is a hivemind of similarly asymptomatic individuals and wishes him to join the system but Makishima escapes. Realizing the truth behind Makishima's escape, Kogami leaves the group to kill him. Akane is later directly contacted by the Sibyl system, which orders her to capture Makishima alive. She agrees to do this on the condition that they withdraw the execution order for Kogami. Learning that Makishima plans to commit [[bioterrorism]] to weaken Japan's economy and bring the system down, the Criminal Investigation Division searches for both Makishima and Kogami. There, Makishima tries killing Ginoza but Masaoka sacrifices his life to save him. Despite Akane's efforts, Kogami kills Makishima and the former's erstwhile comrades never see him again.

In season two, Akane, now leader of a restored Unit One including rookie inspector Mika Shimotsuki, Ginoza, who is demoted to an enforcer, Yayoi and two new enforcers, Sakuya Togane and Sho Hinakawa, face a new threat in the form of Kirito Kamui, another criminal mastermind who, just like Shogo, intends to bring down the Sybil System by exploiting its flaws instead of just wreaking havoc. Skilled in avoiding all forms of detection and capable of helping his supporters to keep their Crime Coefficients low, only a very few believe that he actually exists, including Akane.

==Production==
The series was directed by Naoyoshi Shiotani, written by Gen Urobuchi and features character designs by [[Reborn!]] manga artist [[Akira Amano]]. It stars [[Tomokazu Seki]] as Shinya Kogami, [[Kana Hanazawa]] as Akane Tsunemori, and [[Takahiro Sakurai]] as Shogo Makishima.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/news/2012-03-30/psycho-pass-anime-series-coming-to-noitamina-in-october|title=Psycho-pass Anime Series Coming to Noitamina in October|date=March 30, 2012|accessdate=April 1, 2012|publisher=Anime News Network|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120331063730/http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/news/2012-03-30/psycho-pass-anime-series-coming-to-noitamina-in-october|archivedate=March 31, 2012|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Psycho-Pass'' originated from Production I.G.'s interest in making a successor to [[Mamoru Oshii]]'s ''[[Ghost in the Shell]]'' and ''[[Patlabor]]''; the company hired Katsuyuki Motohiro{{mdash}}who became the series' chief director{{mdash}}and veteran I.G. animator Naoyoshi Shiotani to supervise direction.&lt;ref name="psychopassreviewinter"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/review/psycho-pass-season-one/blu-ray-complete-collection-premium-edition|title=Psycho-Pass Season One Blu-Ray - Complete Collection Premium Edition|date=April 29, 2014|accessdate=April 29, 2014|publisher=Anime News Network|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140429202849/http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/review/psycho-pass-season-one/blu-ray-complete-collection-premium-edition|archivedate=April 29, 2014|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Motohiro wanted to return to making anime after a long hiatus but he needed a charismatic script writer. Motohiro and his staff were surprised with [[Gen Urobuchi]]'s contribution to the highly acclaimed anime series, ''[[Puella Magi Madoka Magica]]''. Motohiro was fascinated by ''Madoka Magica''; he read other works from Urobuchi, which persuaded him to talk to Urobuchi. In early 2011, Motohiro proposed to Urobuchi that the pair should work together.&lt;ref name="interviewmothiro"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/interest/2012-10-11/psycho-pass-chief-director/word-moe-is-banned-among-staff|title=Psycho-Pass Chief Director: Word 'Moe' Is Banned Among Staff|date=October 11, 2012|accessdate=February 23, 2013|publisher=Anime News Network|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130308100027/http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/interest/2012-10-11/psycho-pass-chief-director/word-moe-is-banned-among-staff|archivedate=March 8, 2013|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Early in the making of the series, Motohiro told Naoyoshi Shiotani not to make anything that could not be adapted into a live-action film.&lt;ref name="jentonline"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://j-entonline.com/interviews-and-articles/media-qa-psycho-pass/|title=Media Q&amp;A with Executive Director Katsuyuki Motohiro, Director Naoyoshi Shiotani and Producer Joji Wada (of "PSYCHO-PASS") by Dennis A.

Before work on ''Psycho-Pass'' started, Shiotani was busy working on the film ''[[Blood-C: The Last Dark]]''. As soon as his work with the film ended, Shiotani focused on the series' quality. After episode 16, which proved to be the most challenging and popular of the series, the team found themselves "out of stamina". The next two episodes were made by an outside team, which is reflected in several problems with the animation.&lt;ref name="jentonline"/&gt; In response to this, the producer of the episode said that while he expected problems, he worked to make it the best he could. Shiotani also apologized for the episode's quality.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.crunchyroll.com/anime-news/2013/02/21/urobuchi-supports-psycho-pass-director-on-twitter-spoiler-alert|title=Urobuchi Supports "PSYCHO-PASS" Director On Twitter SPOILER ALERT|publisher=Crunchyroll|accessdate=February 21, 2013|date=October 5, 2012|author=Green, Scott|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130225075049/http://www.crunchyroll.com/anime-news/2013/02/21/urobuchi-supports-psycho-pass-director-on-twitter-spoiler-alert|archivedate=February 25, 2013|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The original team continued working from episode 19 on until the finale; they decided to remake episodes 17 and 18 for their retail release.&lt;ref name="jentonline"/&gt;

The series was first announced in late March 2012 by Fuji TV at its Noitamina press conference.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/news/2012-03-30/psycho-pass-anime-series-coming-to-noitamina-in-october|title=Psycho-pass Anime Series Coming to Noitamina in October|publisher=Anime News Network|date=March 30, 2012|accessdate=August 22, 2014|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140921072121/http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/news/2012-03-30/psycho-pass-anime-series-coming-to-noitamina-in-october|archivedate=September 21, 2014|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In March 2013, Shiotani stated there could be a second season if the show received enough support.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/news/2013-03-30/funimation-confirms-psycho-pass-home-video-release|title=Funimation Confirms Psycho Pass home video release|publisher=Anime News Network|date=March 30, 2013|accessdate=January 7, 2014|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140101222601/https://www.animenewsnetwork.com/news/2013-03-30/funimation-confirms-psycho-pass-home-video-release|archivedate=January 1, 2014|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Once development of the second season started, Shiotani said the new episodes are more difficult to make than those in the first season. He said, "it's more about the show's inflexibility" because the staff have to maintain consistency.&lt;ref name="secondseasonmusic"/&gt; For the second season [[Tow Ubukata]] replaced Urobuchi as main writer.&lt;ref name="ubukata"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/news/2014-06-23/psycho-pass-2-scripts-overseen-by-fafner-tow-ubukata/.75843|title=Psycho-Pass 2's Scripts Overseen by Fafner's Tow Ubukata|publisher=Anime News Network|accessdate=June 23, 2014|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140624144257/http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/news/2014-06-23/psycho-pass-2-scripts-overseen-by-fafner-tow-ubukata/.75843|archivedate=June 24, 2014|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ubukata mentions he was given the idea of expanding the setting in the form of a sequel. As a result of being given the scenario of the TV series and the film, Ubukata had to write the characters' personalities. Although time of the production was short, he had the time to discuss with the first series' staff. Shiotani aided the team for the final episode which Ubukata was satisfied with.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/interview/2015-05-20/tow-ubukata/.87808|title=Interview: Tow Ubukata|author1=Chapman, Hope|author2=Nelkin Sarah|date=May 20, 2015|publisher=Anime News Network|accessdate=April 21, 2015|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150521013206/http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/interview/2015-05-20/tow-ubukata/.87808|archivedate=May 21, 2015|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Design===
[[File:PsychoPassKogamisketch.jpg|thumb|right|Sketches of Shinya Kogami by Akira Amano. The staff avoided using colors that would stand out.]]
When hearing the comments from [[Atsuko Ishizuka]], director of  ''[[The Pet Girl of Sakurasou]]'', about the way the characters were designed first, Shiotani realized it was the opposite for his team, who had to create the setting first and then the characters because they "are almost being played by the world". As a result, the characters were designed by [[manga artist]] [[Akira Amano]] to balance them with the dark atmosphere by having them "palatable and very relate-able". The staff avoided using bright colors that would stand out.&lt;ref name="panel"/&gt; Akane Tsunemori was created as the most relatable character, who would question the setting from the audience's point of view and as the heroine who would come between the main character, Shinya Kogami, and his main rival, and enemy, Shogo Makishima. Akane's progression from an innocent newcomer to a mature and haunted person was one of the staff's main objectives.&lt;ref name="jentonline"/&gt;

Motohiro allowed his team to use very graphic elements, even though they could reduce female viewership. He acknowledges that the series may be too violent for a younger demographic and said that he would not want his son to watch it because of its psychological brutality.&lt;ref name="interviewmothiro"/&gt; He added that the team did not want to make a violent series but an "artistic series that just happened to have some violence included in it".&lt;ref name="jentonline"/&gt; About the amount of violence, Shiotani told Urobuchi, "just let us deal with it".&lt;ref name="jentonline"/&gt; Some of these violent scenes occur off-camera, but whenever a protagonist was involved the moment was developed to be memorable. The team twice had to remake scenes because the television station complained that they went "overboard."&lt;ref name="jentonline"/&gt;

Motohiro wanted the series to counter concurrent anime trends. The use of ''[[Moe (slang)|moe]]'' (slang) was banned at staff meetings because they appreciated dramas like ''[[Mobile Suit Gundam]]'' and ''Patlabor'' that focus on conflicts between male characters. As the series was "anti-moe", the team decided to avoid having the female lead character Akane remove her clothes and instead had Kogami do it. Nevertheless, the show attracted a female viewership because the conflict between the male characters appeared to attract the ''[[shonen ai]]'' genre fans.&lt;ref name="panel"/&gt; Although Shiotani also wanted the series to avoid romance between male characters, he believed the fight scenes between male characters unintentionally attracted female fans.&lt;ref name="panel"/&gt; The staff decided to focus on friendships rather than romantic relationships.&lt;ref name="jentonline"/&gt;

===Influences===
The series was inspired by several Western films, most notably ''[[L.A. Confidential (film)|L.A. Confidential]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/interview/2013-07-23/interview-george-wada-producer-of-attack-on-titan|title=Interview: George Wada, Producer of Attack on Titan|date=July 23, 2013|accessdate=July 23, 2013|publisher=Anime News Network|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130725042102/http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/interview/2013-07-23/interview-george-wada-producer-of-attack-on-titan|archivedate=July 25, 2013|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Director Naoyoshi Shiotani cited several other influences, including ''[[Minority Report (film)|Minority Report]]'', ''[[Gattaca]]'', ''[[Brazil (1985 film)|Brazil]]'' and ''[[Blade Runner]]''; the latter of which he compared very closely to ''Psycho-Pass''.&lt;ref name="panel"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/convention/2013/sakura-con/5|title=Directors's Panel with Katsuyuki Motohiro, Naoyoshi Shiotani, and Atsuko Ishizuka|date=March 30, 2013|accessdate=December 30, 2013|publisher=[[Anime News Network]]|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131231145932/http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/convention/2013/sakura-con/5|archivedate=December 31, 2013|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Before the making of the series, Urobuchi insisted on using a [[Philip K. Dick]]-inspired, dystopian narrative.&lt;ref name="psychopassreviewinter"/&gt; The psychological themes were based on the time Shiotani watched ''[[Lupin III]]'' during his childhood because he thought about adding "today's youth trauma" to the series.&lt;ref name="interviewmothiro"/&gt; The rivalry between the main characters was based on the several dramas the staff liked.&lt;ref name="panel"/&gt; Other voice actors have been credited in the making of the series because of the ways they added traits to the characters.&lt;ref name="interviewmothiro"/&gt;

===Music===
The staff had problems composing an opening theme for the series until someone provided some music by [[Ling Tosite Sigure]], who was engaged to compose the opening theme. [[Egoist (band)|Egoist]], who composed the ending theme, had debuted on Noitamina with ''[[Guilty Crown]]''. Shiotani said they asked Egoist to record three versions of the ending theme so they could alternate them to match the episode's ending.&lt;ref name="secondseasonmusic"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://otakuusamagazine.com/Anime/News1/Noitamina-Interviews-PsychoPass-Director-5650.aspx |title=Noitamina Interviews Psycho-Pass Director |publisher=Otaku USA |date=May 8, 2014 |accessdate=May 9, 2014 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6PRvypoid?url=http://otakuusamagazine.com/Anime/News1/Noitamina-Interviews-PsychoPass-Director-5650.aspx |archivedate=May  9, 2014 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Across the series, time limits resulted in the ending songs being removed or replaced with instrumental versions to avoid cutting scenes from the episode. When there were concerns from the producers of the songs, Tomohiro and Shiotani discussed this with them.&lt;ref name="jentonline"/&gt;

Two ''Psycho-Pass'' CDs were included in the second and fifth Japanese home media release of the series.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://psycho-pass.com/bd-dvd/#v2|title=Blu-ray &amp; DVD Series Volume 2|work=Psycho Pass|language=Japanese|accessdate=January 8, 2013|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130115074642/http://psycho-pass.com/bd-dvd/#v2|archivedate=January 15, 2013|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://psycho-pass.com/bd-dvd/#v5|title=Blu-ray &amp; DVD Series Volume 5|work=Psycho Pass|language=Japanese|accessdate=January 8, 2013|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130115074642/http://psycho-pass.com/bd-dvd/#v5|archivedate=January 15, 2013|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ''Psycho Pass'' original soundtrack was released by Sony Music Entertainment on May 29, 2013.

As some critics have noted, ''Psycho-Pass'' explores societal and psychological themes, such as the price of living without stress, and without fear of crime. Indeed, the Sibyl System targets individuals who are considering performing actions that might cause stress to others. But this raises the question of whether it is morally and socially acceptable to charge individuals with crimes they have not yet committed. For example, in the first episode, a woman is kidnapped, and the resultant trauma causes her Psycho-Pass to become clouded. According to Sibyl's instructions, the police are therefore prepared to kill her. But Akane steps in, refusing to accept Sibyl's verdict, and manages to bring the woman's Psycho-Pass level back to the acceptable range by speaking gently to her. Consequently, this challenges the notion that the potential to commit a crime necessarily correlates with actually committing the crime. According to Anime News Network, "We are all capable of doing bad things at times{{mdash}}should we be punished because we thought of hurting someone before we act on it? Or because we were victims? It really all comes back to that first episode and Akane's reaction to the victim who presented as a violent criminal".&lt;ref name="psychostream"&gt;{{cite web|publisher=Anime News Network|url=http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/review/psycho-pass/episodes-1|title=Review: Psycho-Pass Episodes 1 - 11 Streaming|date=|accessdate=April 3, 2013|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130328220114/http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/review/psycho-pass/episodes-1|archivedate=March 28, 2013|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Psycho-Pass'' further suggests that the price of living without stress includes overriding the individual's needs in favor of general social value. It is morally and socially acceptable to kill individuals who may potentially commit crimes, so long as we accept that the harm that a criminal causes to society outweighs the harm we cause to an individual who is falsely charged. In other words, the Sibyl System operates on the principles of opportunity cost and acceptable risk. But relying on the Sibyl System paradoxically creates a society which fears no crime as a whole, but individuals who personally fear the consequences of the Sibyl System's verdicts. As such, Urobuchi himself has said that one of the series' central thematic ideas is "fear" as seen through Shogo Makishima's feeling of being out of place - because the Sibyl System cannot recognize him for what he actually is, he feels displaced and deviant within the structure of society itself.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|publisher=Anime News Network|url=http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/interview/2014-09-17/gen-urobuchi/.78542|title=Interview: Gen Urobuchi|date=September 17, 2014|accessdate=September 17, 2014|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140917164359/http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/interview/2014-09-17/gen-urobuchi/.78542|archivedate=September 17, 2014|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Emotional repression is also explored in ''Psycho-Pass''. The identification of latent criminals is partially based around the avoidance of emotions that society judges to be negative, such as sadness or anger. To avoid being identified as a latent criminal, one must not feel these emotions heavily outside, where their Psycho-Pass can be scanned. Kotaku states, "because of these scans, Psycho-Pass shows an interesting future where 'mental beauty' is as sought after as physical beauty. It is also a future where the police's job is little more than to watch the latent criminals they control—because if they did any real detective work, they might start to think like the criminals they are trying to catch and thus become latent criminals themselves."&lt;ref name="kotaku"/&gt; Many of the main characters feel nostalgia throughout the series. The many references to older literature, philosophy, music and theatre create a "nostalgic world building for a time before psycho-passes".&lt;ref name="psychostream"/&gt;

==Reception==
[[Fuji TV]] producer Akitoshi Mori said ''Psycho-Pass'' was the first work under his control. Early screenings of the series at the Noitamina Shop &amp; Café attracted few viewers, which bothered Mori. However, as the series continued, the quantity of viewers increased. By the final episode, over 1,000 people had queued to watch the finale even though the venue could only accommodate seventy people. This made Mori happy because he realized how many fans were following and supporting the show; he wanted  to see a bigger audience at future screenings.&lt;ref name="secondseasonannounced"/&gt; DVDs and Blu-ray discs of the series achieved good sales.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/news/2013-06-25/japan-animation-dvd-ranking-june-17-23 |publisher=Anime News Network |date=June 25, 2013 |accessdate=April 29, 2014 |title=Japan's Animation DVD Ranking, June 17–23 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140815104503/http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/news/2013-06-25/japan-animation-dvd-ranking-june-17-23 |archivedate=August 15, 2014 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/news/2013-06-25/japan-animation-blu-ray-disc-ranking-june-17-23 |publisher=Anime News Network |date=June 25, 2013 |accessdate=April 29, 2014 |title=Japan's Animation Blu-ray Disc Ranking, June 17–23 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140406102929/http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/news/2013-06-25/japan-animation-blu-ray-disc-ranking-june-17-23 |archivedate=April 6, 2014 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; In April 2014, the series was nominated for the [[Seiun Award]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.crunchyroll.com/anime-news/2014/04/28-1/gargantia-psycho-pass-and-girls-und-panzer-nominated-for-seiun-sci-fi-award|publisher=Crunchyroll|date=April 28, 2014|accessdate=April 28, 2014|title="Gargantia," "Psycho-Pass" and "Girls und Panzer" Nominated for Seiun Sci-Fi Award|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140429044641/http://www.crunchyroll.com/anime-news/2014/04/28-1/gargantia-psycho-pass-and-girls-und-panzer-nominated-for-seiun-sci-fi-award|archivedate=April 29, 2014|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the ''[[Newtype]]'' anime awards from 2013, it was voted as fourth best title of the year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/news/2013-10-13/attack-on-titan-wins-top-prizes-in-newtype-anime-awards|title=Attack on Titan Wins Top Prizes in Newtype Anime Awards|publisher=Anime News Network|accessdate=June 12, 2014|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151121103813/http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/news/2013-10-13/attack-on-titan-wins-top-prizes-in-newtype-anime-awards|archivedate=November 21, 2015|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Episode 11 of the series was awarded "Best Episode" in the Noitamina 10th anniversary fan vote.

During the streaming of the series, Silverman criticized the animation because of the low lighting levels that might make it hard to understand.&lt;ref name="psychostream"/&gt;&lt;ref name="annsecondreview"/&gt; Hiroko Yamamura from Japanator noted the series' high budget and praised the animation style and the focus on details and technology. She was attracted by its premise and expected the quality to remain consistent across the entire series.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.japanator.com/first-impressions-psycho-pass-27060.phtml|title=First Impressions: Psycho-Pass|publisher=Japanator|accessdate=March 21, 2013|date=October 16, 2012|author=Yamamura, Hiroko|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121228172646/http://www.japanator.com/first-impressions-psycho-pass-27060.phtml|archivedate=December 28, 2012|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, Jacob Hope Chapman from ANN praised the animation for its high quality.&lt;ref name="psychopassreviewinter"/&gt; Episode 18, which is known for its flawed animation, was improved for the home media release of the series.&lt;ref name="halImetyourmother"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/shelf-life/2014-04-14#pp|title=Hal I Met Your Mother|publisher=Anime News Network|accessdate=April 14, 2014|date=April 14, 2014|author=Dong, Bamboo|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140414232335/http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/shelf-life/2014-04-14#pp|archivedate=April 14, 2014|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Feedback to ''Psycho-Pass 2'' has ranged from mixed to negative. Dan Rhodes from UK Anime Network noted that ''Psycho-Pass 2'', while entertaining, lacked the twists of the first season and appeal of Gen Urobuchi's writing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.uk-anime.net/anime/Psycho-Pass_2_Collector's_Edition.html|title=ANIME REVIEW: Psycho-Pass 2 Collector's Edition|publisher=UK Anime Network|author=Rhodes, Dan|accessdate=October 1, 2016|date=May 20, 2016|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180407170731/http://www.uk-anime.net/anime/Psycho-Pass_2_Collector's_Edition.html|archivedate=April 7, 2018|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Richard Eisenbeis from Kotaku praised the origins of the Sybil System which was unexplained in the first season. While also praising the differences between Akane and the new Inspector, Mika Shimotsuki, Eisenbeis criticized the new antagonist and how much gorier the series was in contrast to the first one.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://kotaku.com/psycho-pass-2-is-a-deliciously-dark-and-disturbing-cybe-1674300062|title=Psycho-Pass 2 is a deliciously dark and disturbing cybernetic tale|publisher=Kotaku|author=Eisenbeis, Richard|accessdate=October 16, 2016|date=December 23, 2014|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161018205551/http://kotaku.com/psycho-pass-2-is-a-deliciously-dark-and-disturbing-cybe-1674300062|archivedate=October 18, 2016|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nick Creamer from Anime News Network was more negative during his review as he felt the new writer, [[Tow Ubukata]], did not make the anime appealing despite his previous enjoyable works. He went on to say "overall, Psycho-Pass 2 stands as one of the most disappointing works I've ever watched to completion," citing it a failure as both a sequel and an independent series.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/review/psycho-pass-2/bd-dvd-season-2/.100969|title=Psycho-Pass 2 BD+DVD - Season 2|publisher=Anime News Network|author=Rhodes, Dan|accessdate=October 1, 2016|date=April 12, 2016|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161010130017/http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/review/psycho-pass-2/bd-dvd-season-2/.100969|archivedate=October 10, 2016|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Pulaka''', ''[[Cyrtosperma merkusii]]'', or '''swamp taro''', is a [[crop]] grown in [[Tuvalu]] and an important source of [[carbohydrate]]s for the area's inhabitants.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Koch|first=Gerd|title=The material culture of Tuvalu|publisher=Institute of Pacific Studies, [[University of the South Pacific]]|origyear=1983|year=1990|page=46|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=w7aeiuIXVigC&amp;pg=PA46|accessdate=12 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is a "[[swamp]] crop" similar to [[taro]],&lt;ref name="root crop"&gt;{{Cite news

The same plant is known as [[Babai (Swamp Taro)|babai]] in Kiribati, ''puraka'' in Cook Islands, ''pula’a'' in Samoa, ''via kan'' in Fiji, Pulaka in Tokelau, ''simiden'' in Chuuk, ''swam taro'' in Papua New Guinea, and ''navia'' in Vanuatu.&lt;ref name=fao&gt;{{cite web|title=Pacific Food Security Tookit Module 4 - Pacific Root Crops|url=http://www.fao.org/docrep/013/am014e/am014e04.pdf|publisher=[[FAO]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Pulaka roots need to be cooked for hours to reduce toxicity in the [[corm]]s, but are rich in nutrients, especially [[calcium]].&lt;ref name="un"/&gt; Pulaka is an  important part of Tuvalu cultural and culinary tradition, now under threat from rising [[sea level]] and displacement from the growing use of imported food products.

==Cultivation==
The crop is grown in pits dug into the [[limestone]] [[atoll]]&lt;ref name="knox"/&gt; and is fertilized by adding leaves from different plants.&lt;ref name="inside"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://inside.org.au/tuvalunacy-or-the-real-thing/|title=Tuvalunacy, or the real thing?|last=Corlett|first=David|date=27 November 2008|work=Inside|accessdate=12 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The plants derive water from the [[Lens (hydrology)|freshwater lens]] found a few meters below the atoll.&lt;ref name="plight"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Laban|first=Winnie|date=October 1991|title=The Plight of the Pacific|journal=[[Multinational Monitor]]|volume=12|issue=10|url=http://multinationalmonitor.org/hyper/issues/1991/10/laban.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; For this reason the cultivation of pulaka is threatened by rising sea levels caused by [[global warming]]: the plant does not thrive in the salt water which seeps into the pits:&lt;ref name="knox"/&gt; it rots the roots, turns the leaves yellow, and stunts the plant's growth.&lt;ref name="un"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.un.org/webcast/pdfs/unia1234.pdf|title=Tuvalu Food Security|last=Gorišek|first=Saša|date=April 2010|publisher=[[United Nations]]|accessdate=12 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; These saltwater intrusions occur more often now that the high tides have become higher, and more frequently flood the islands.&lt;ref name="inside"/&gt; To alleviate the problem of saltwater pollution, some islanders have begun to line the pits, side and bottom, with cement.&lt;ref name="knox"&gt;{{Cite news

  | accessdate = 10 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Preparation and preservation==
Pulaka makes up the bulk of the islanders' traditional diet; it is usually supplemented by fish.&lt;ref name="koch"&gt;{{cite book|last=Koch|first=Gerd|title=The material culture of Tuvalu|publisher=Institute of Pacific Studies, [[University of the South Pacific]]|origyear=1983|year=1990|pages=73–85|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=w7aeiuIXVigC&amp;pg=PA73|accessdate=12 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since the unprocessed [[corm]]s are toxic, they must always be cooked, usually in an earth oven. Many of the recipes call for the addition of [[coconut cream]] or toddy, or both. On [[Niutao]], coconut cream (''lolo'') is poured over beaten pulp of pulaka, to make a dish called ''tulolo''. A similar dish on [[Nukufetau]], with halved corms, is called ''tulolo pulaka''; with beaten corms the dish is called ''fakapapa''. ''Fekei'' is made on all the islands, and consists of pulaka which is grated (typically this is done by the women) with the aid of limestone with holes drilled in it. The resulting pulp is wrapped in pulaka leaves and steamed, and mixed with coconut cream.&lt;ref name="koch"/&gt;

Preserving any food on the islands is difficult because of the hot climate. Pulaka is usually preserved by burying it in the ground, and it will keep up to three months. Cooks take baked pulaka corms and slice them to dry them in the sun; after six days of drying, the slices (''pulaka valuvalu'') are packed in coconut containers and hung from roof beams, and will keep up to seven years. The dried substance can be cooked in coconut cream and water to create a dish called ''likoliko''. On Nukufetao, ''puatolo'' is a dish made from grated pulaka and toddy, baked in the oven; when dried in the sun it will keep for three months.&lt;ref name="koch"/&gt;

==Cultural significance==
The pits are dug and maintained by individual families over generations and have great cultural and personal significance: "The ownership and cultivation of the pulaka pits is an important part of family identity, cultural pride and survival. Encroachment of the salt water into the pulaka pit threatens the future of the people of Tuvalu."&lt;ref name="plight"/&gt; In addition, the secrets of producing the crop are often transferred from father to son, and when a father teaches his son how to plant pulaka, he is "practicing how to live like a man."&lt;ref name="un"/&gt;

Besides rising saltwater levels, "changing lifestyles and eating habits" also threaten the cultivation of the crop,&lt;ref name="root crop"/&gt; a process that began during and after [[World War II]], when American occupying troops supplied the islands with imported foods and many pits were no longer maintained.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web

Merriam-Webster's ''Dictionary of Synonyms'' suggests the word "'''trip'''" as particularly appropriate with reference to relatively short journeys, especially connotating business or pleasure.&lt;ref&gt;

'''Sharing economy''' is an umbrella term with a range of meanings, often used to describe [[economic activity]] involving online transactions.&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Taeihagh|first1=Araz|title=Crowdsourcing, Sharing Economies, and Development|journal=Journal of Developing Societies|date=19 June 2017|pages=0169796X1771007|doi=10.1177/0169796X17710072}}&lt;/ref&gt; Originally growing out of the [[Open-source movement|open-source]] community to refer to [[Social peer-to-peer processes|peer-to-peer]] based sharing of access to goods and services,&lt;ref name="thedefinition"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Hamari |first=Juho |last2=Sjöklint |first2=Mimmi |last3=Ukkonen |first3=Antti |date=2016 |title=The Sharing Economy: Why People Participate in Collaborative Consumption |volume=67 |issue=9 |pages=2047–2059|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/255698095_The_Sharing_Economy_Why_People_Participate_in_Collaborative_Consumption |journal=Journal of the Association for Information Science and Technology |doi=10.1002/asi.23552}}&lt;/ref&gt; the term is now sometimes used in a broader sense to describe any sales transactions that are done via [[Two-sided market|online market places]], even ones that are business to business ([[B2C|B2B]]), rather than peer-to-peer. For this reason, the term ''sharing economy'' has been criticized as misleading, some arguing that even services that enable peer-to-peer exchange can be primarily profit-driven.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://time.com/money/2933937/sharing-economy-airbnb-uber-monkeyparking/|title=Can We Stop Pretending the Sharing Economy Is All About Sharing?|last=Tuttle|first=Brad|website=MONEY.com|access-date=2016-08-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, many commentators assert that the term is still valid as a mean of describing a generally more democratized marketplace, even when it's applied to a broader spectrum of services. Alternatively, collaborative consumption or the sharing economy refers rather to resource circulation systems which allow a consumer two-sided role, in which consumers may act as both providers of resources or obtainers of resources.&lt;ref name="two-sided role"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Ertz|first=Myriam|last2=Durif|first2=Fabien|last3=Arcand|first3=Manon|date=2016 |title=Collaborative consumption: Conceptual snapshot at a buzzword|volume=19|issue=9|pages=1–23|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/311611603_Collaborative_Consumption_Conceptual_Snapshot_at_a_Buzzword|journal=Journal of Entrepreneurship Education}}&lt;/ref&gt; The exchange may be performed directly on a peer-to-peer basis, or indirectly through a mediator (ex. store, website, app); online or offline; for free or for other compensation (ex. money, points, services, etc.).&lt;ref name="exchange"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Ertz|first=Myriam|last2=Durif|first2=Fabien|last3=Arcand|first3=Manon|date=2018 |title=A conceptual perspective on collaborative consumption|journal=Academy of Marketing Science Review|doi=10.1007/s13162-018-0121-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; This vision allows for a broader understanding of the sharing economy on the overarching criteria of consumer changing role capacity.&lt;ref name="two-sided role"/&gt;&lt;ref name="exchange"/&gt;

The sharing economy may take a variety of forms, including using [[information technology]] to provide individuals with information that enables the optimization of resources through the mutualization of excess capacity in goods and services.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Business Models Shaping New Mobility|url=https://www.wsp.com/en-GL/insights/business-models-shaping-new-mobility|work=January, 2018|publisher=WSP Global|accessdate=9 Jan 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Collaborative consumption as a phenomenon is a class of economic arrangements in which participants mutualize access to products or services, in addition to finding original ways to individual ownership.&lt;ref name="thedefinition" /&gt;&lt;ref name="exchange" /&gt; The phenomenon stems from an increasing consumer desire to be in control of their consumption instead of "passive 'victims' of hyperconsumption".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Botsman|first1=Rachel|last2=Rogers|first2=Roo|title=What's mine is yours : how collaborative consumption is changing the way we live|date=2011|publisher=Collins|location=London|isbn=978-0-00-739591-0|page=51|edition=Rev. and updated}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The collaborative consumption model is used in online marketplaces such as [[eBay]] as well as emerging sectors such as social lending, peer-to-peer accommodation, peer-to-peer travel experiences,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = From homes to meals to cars, 'sharing' has changed the face of travel|url = http://www.chicagotribune.com/lifestyles/travel/sc-trav-1229-sharing-economy-20151216-story.html|website = chicagotribune.com|accessdate = 2015-12-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; peer-to-peer task assignments or travel advising, [[carsharing]] or [[commuting|commute]]-bus sharing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hbscny.org/article.html?aid=587 |title=Harvard Business School Club of New York – What's Mine Is Yours: The Rise of Collaborative Consumption |publisher=Hbscny.org |date=2011-06-16 |accessdate=2015-03-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''[[Harvard Business Review]]'', the ''[[Financial Times]]'' and many others have argued that "sharing economy" is a misnomer. Harvard Business Review suggested the correct word for the sharing economy in the broad sense of the term is "[[access economy]]". The authors say, "When "sharing" is market-mediated—when a company is an intermediary between consumers who don't know each other—it is no longer sharing at all. Rather, consumers are paying to access someone else's goods or services.".&lt;ref name="Harvard Business Review"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://hbr.org/2015/01/the-sharing-economy-isnt-about-sharing-at-all |title= The Sharing Economy Isn't About Sharing at All |publisher=Harvard Business Review |date=2015-01-28 |accessdate=2015-07-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Scope ==
According to sharing economy expert [[Alex Stephany]], it is a mystery as to who first used the term ''sharing economy'', which has left the term "without a guardian and vulnerable to loose definitions".&lt;ref name = "Stephany"&gt;

A variety of definitions exist. "The people who share" is one of the broadest definitions, which encompasses the [[Access economy|on-demand economy]], the [[gig economy]], [[social media]], and a great deal else.&lt;ref&gt;

|accessdate=2016-08-01}}
&lt;/ref&gt; Academic definitions tend to be narrower, limiting the sharing economy to only peer-to-peer transactions, and sometimes further limiting the definition to only peer-to-peer transactions that relate to the temporary exchange of physical goods.&lt;ref name = "cost of Non-Europe"/&gt; Another set of narrow definitions used by free culture activists, members of the co-operative movement and similar, excludes for-profit companies from the sharing economy, even if they facilitate just peer-to-peer transactions.  Sometimes called the "real" or "true" sharing economy, organisations that operate within such definitions are mostly small and localist, run by volunteers on a cooperative basis, though sometimes also by governments and municipal authorities. They can include some organisations that operate without online transactions, such as [[Bicycle cooperative|bike kitchens]]. The "true" sharing economy does include some large internationally available web sites however, such as [[The Freecycle Network|Freecycle]].&lt;ref name = "cost of Non-Europe"&gt;

The term ''sharing economy'' has been widely used since about 2010, yet according to a [[Pew Research Center|Pew]] survey taken in winter 2015, only 27% of Americans had heard of the term.&lt;ref name ="Pew"&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;

Survey respondents who had heard of the term had divergent views on what it meant, with many thinking it concerned "sharing" in the traditional sense of the term.&lt;ref name ="Pew"/&gt; In 2010 and 2011, many people involved with the sharing economy did indeed consider it to be about sharing in the traditional sense. A commonly used example at the time was the idea of sharing a power drill—a tool that many consumers might use for only a few minutes in their lifetime. Advocates said it made sense for regular consumers not to buy their own power drill, but to borrow from others instead, and that this borrowing could be facilitated by online platforms. Several startups companies were launched to help people share drills and similar goods along these lines. Yet looking back from 2015, it was clear that consumers had generally not been interested in such temporary exchanges, leading to the failure of many startups which aimed to facilitate traditional sharing.&lt;ref&gt;Economic Explanation: From Sharecropping to the Sharing Economy http://econpapers.repec.org/article/bpjmaneco/v_3a3_3ay_3a2016_3ai_3a1_3ap_3a77-96_3an_3a4.htm&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;What makes Uber and Airbnb flourish while others fail in ‘sharing economy’?

The scope of the sharing economy has been a subject of academic debate. Depending on the criteria used, some platforms would be included within the sharing economy, but not others. For example, going by whether companies self-describe as being part of the sharing economy, [[TaskRabbit]]  would be included, but not [[Amazon Mechanical Turk|mechanical Turk]].&lt;ref&gt;

Commercial implementations{{r|friedman}} encompass a wide range of structures including mostly for-profit, and, to a lesser extent, co-operative structures.{{r|rosenberg}} The sharing economy provides expanded access to products, services and talent beyond one-to-one or singular ownership, which is sometimes referred to as "disownership".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Wang|first=Ray|title=Monday's Musings: Four Elements for A #SharingEconomy Biz Model In #MatrixCommerce|url=http://blog.softwareinsider.org/2013/05/26/mondays-musings-how-the-sharing-economy-impacts-matrix-commerce/|work=May 26, 2013|publisher=Software Insider|accessdate=13 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; individuals actively participate as users, providers, lenders or borrowers in varied and evolving [[peer-to-peer]] exchange schemes which are often [[world Wide Web|web]]-mediated.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Collaborative Economy|url=http://www.slideshare.net/Altimeter/the-collaborative-economy|work=June 4, 2013|publisher=Altimeter Group|accessdate=13 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
Several key macro developments led to the (re-)emergence of mutualization in consumption. The "sharing economy" results from several deep-seated technological, economic, political, and societal changes:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Ertz|first=Myriam|last2=Durif|first2=Fabien|last3=Arcand|first3=Manon|title=An analysis of the origins of collaborative consumption and its implications for marketing|journal=Academy of Marketing Studies Journal|year=2016|ssrn=2799862|accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Technological: the Web transformed consumers' relationship to objects.
* Economic: austerity and crises, decline of stable and full-time employment as well as of purchasing power.
* Political: withering of the State and its increased adjustment to the market ethos.
* Social: society views consumption as a central project in their lives.

The term "sharing economy" began to appear in the early 2000s, as new business structures emerged due to the Great Recession, enabling social technologies, and an increasing sense of urgency around global population growth and resource depletion. Professor [[Lawrence Lessig]] was possibly first to use the term in 2008, though others claim the origin of the term is unknown.&lt;ref name = "Stephany"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;

The phenomena of the sharing economy certainly emerged much earlier than 2008 however, even in the sense of exchange co-ordinated by online platforms. One inspiration was the [[tragedy of the commons]], which refers to the idea that when we all act solely in our self-interest, we deplete the shared resources we need for our own quality of life. The Harvard law professor [[Yochai Benkler]],  one of the earliest proponents of open source software, posited that network technology could mitigate this issue through what he called '[[commons-based peer production]]', a concept first articulated in 2002.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Benkler|first=Yochai|title=Coase's Penguin, or, Linux and The Nature of the Firm|journal=The Yale Law Journal|year=2002|volume=112|url=http://www.yale.edu/yalelj/112/BenklerWEB.pdf|accessdate=13 June 2013|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101010152105/http://www.yale.edu/yalelj/112/BenklerWEB.pdf|archivedate=10 October 2010|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Benkler then extended that analysis to "shareable goods" in ''Sharing Nicely: On Shareable goods and the emergence of sharing as a modality of economic production''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Benkler|first=Yochai|title=Sharing Nicely: On Shareable goods and the emergence of sharing as a modality of economic production|journal=The Yale Law Journal|year=2004|volume=114|url=http://digitalcommons.law.yale.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=4058&amp;context=fss_papers|accessdate=9 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The term "collaborative consumption" was coined by Marcus Felson and Joe L. Spaeth in their paper "Community Structure and Collaborative Consumption: A routine activity approach" published in 1978 in the ''American Behavioral Scientist''.&lt;ref&gt;Felson, Marcus and Joe L. Spaeth (1978), "Community Structure and Collaborative Consumption: A routine activity approach," American Behavioral Scientist, 21 (March–April), 614–24.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2011, collaborative consumption was named one of ''[[TIME]]'' magazine's 10 ideas that will change the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.time.com/time/specials/packages/article/0,28804,2059521_2059717_2059710,00.html | work=Time | title=10 Ideas That Will Change The World | date=March 17, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A recent study,&lt;ref name="bibliometrics"/&gt; using bibliometrics and network analysis, analyzed the evolution of scholarly research on collaborative consumption, and identified that this expression started in 2010 with Botsman and Rogers' (2010) book "What's mine is yours: The rise of collaborative consumption". The number of studies published on the subject then increased exponentially in 2014. Furthermore, there are four clusters of research: 1) exploration and conceptualization of collaborative consumption; 2) consumer behavior and marketing empiricism; 3) mutualization and sharing systems; 4) sustainability in the collaborative economy. The analysis suggests that this last cluster was under-researched in contrast to the three others, but has started to increase in importance since 2017.

=== Developments since 2014 ===
The UK Government in its 2015 [[Budget#United Kingdom|Budget]] set out objectives to improve economic growth including to make Britain the "...best place in the world to start, invest in, and grow a business, including through a package of measures to help unlock the potential of the sharing economy..."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/416330/47881_Budget_2015_Web_Accessible.pdf|title=Support for the sharing economy|last=|first=|date=|work=H. M. Treasury, Budget 2015, section 1.193|format=PDF|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|4}}

Also in 2015, ''The Business of Sharing by Alex Stephany'', CEO of [[JustPark]], was published by Palgrave Macmillan.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.thememo.com/2015/05/05/review-the-business-of-sharing | title= Review: The Business Of Sharing | date=May 5, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The book features interviews with high-profile entrepreneurs such as [[Martin Varsavsky]] and venture capitalists such as [[Fred Wilson (financier)|Fred Wilson]].

===Size and growth===
The rapid growth of the sharing economy has been frequently remarked on.&lt;ref name="Harvard Business Review"/&gt; Yet according to a report by the [[United States Department of Commerce|United States Department of Commerce in June 2016]], quantitative research on size and growth remains sparse. Such growth estimates as there are can be challenging to evaluate due to different and sometimes unspecified definitions about what sort of activity counts as sharing economy transactions.&lt;ref name = "Digital Matching"/&gt;

The June 2016 report summarised currently available research. This included a 2014 study by [[PricewaterhouseCoopers]], which looked at five components of the sharing economy:  travel, car sharing, finance, staffing and streaming. It found that global spending in these sectors totalled about $15 billion in 2014, which was only about 5% of the total spending in those areas.  The report also forecasts a possible increase of "sharing economy" spending in these areas to $335 billion by 2025, which would be about 50% of the total spending in said five areas.&lt;ref name = "Digital Matching"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;

== Types of collaborative consumption ==
[[File:One day living with commons-based peer production communities (CBPP).svg|thumb|Examples of [[Commons-based peer production]] (CBPP) communities, aka P2P communities]]

{{Main|Collaborative consumption}}

Originally, Botsman and Rogers (2010) identified three resource circulation systems within collaborative consumption, i.e. the sharing economy: product service systems, redistribution markets and collaborative lifestyles.

=== Product-service systems ===
{{Main|Product-service system}}
Product-service systems refer to commercial peer-to-peer mutualization systems (CPMS), allowing consumers to engage in monetized exchanges through [[Social peer-to-peer processes|peer-to-peer]]-based for temporary access to goods. Goods that are privately owned can be shared or rented out via peer-to-peer marketplaces.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1&gt;{{cite web|author1=Rachel Botsman|author2=Roo Rogers |url=http://hbr.org/2010/10/beyond-zipcar-collaborative-consumption/ar/1 |title=Beyond Zipcar: Collaborative Consumption |publisher=Hbr.org |date=1922-01-01 |accessdate=2015-03-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, BMW's "[[DriveNow]]" is a car rental service that offers an alternative to owning a car. Users can access a car when and where they need them and pay for their usage by the minute.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.bmwblog.com/2011/03/21/bmw-and-sixt-establish-drivenow-joint-venture-for-premium-car-sharing/|title = DriveNow: BMW and Sixt Joint Venture for premium car sharing|date = |accessdate = |website = |publisher = |last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Redistribution markets ===
A system of collaborative consumption is based on used or pre-owned goods being passed on from someone who does not want them to someone who does want them. This is another alternative to the more common 'reduce, reuse, recycle, repair' methods of dealing with waste. In some markets, the goods may be free, as on [[The Freecycle Network|Freecycle]], [[Zwaggle]] and [[Kashless.org|Kashless]]. In others, the goods are swapped (as on [[Swap.com]]) or sold for cash (as on eBay, craigslist, and uSell).

=== Collaborative lifestyles ===
Collaborative lifestyles refer to community-based platforms, allowing consumers to engage in monetized exchanges through [[Social peer-to-peer processes|peer-to-peer]]-based for services or access to resources such as money or skills.&lt;ref name="morally"/&gt; These systems are based on people with similar needs or interests banding together to mutualize and exchange less-tangible assets such as time, space, skills, and money. The growth of mobile technology provides a platform to enable location-based GPS technology and to also provide real-time sharing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Owyang|first=Jeremiah|title=The mobile technology stack for the Collaborative Economy|url=https://venturebeat.com/2015/02/17/the-mobile-technology-stack-for-the-collaborative-economy/|accessdate=24 February 2015|publisher=VentureBeat|date=24 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Resource circulation systems==

=== Crowdfunding platforms ===
{{Main|Crowdfunding}}
According to some authors, sector-specific models may stand out as specific components of the sharing economy. These models also use a two-sided marketplace to enable individuals to contribute funds to entrepreneurs, artists, civic programs and projects.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Karim R. Lakhani |url=http://hbr.org/2013/04/using-the-crowd-as-an-innovation-partner/ |title=Using the Crowd as an Innovation Partner |publisher=Hbr.org |date=1922-01-01 |accessdate=2015-03-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Expert networks ===
{{Main|Expert network}}
These models also use a two-sided marketplace to enable experts to provide on-demand information to consumers.

=== Transparent and open data ===
Many state, local and federal governments&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Mazmanian|first=Adam|title=Can open data change the culture of government?|url=http://fcw.com/articles/2013/05/23/digital-government-anniversary.aspx|newspaper=Federal Computer Week|date=May 22, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  are engaged in [[Open data|Open Data]] initiatives and projects such as data.gov&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.data.gov/ |title=Data.gov |publisher=Data.gov |date= |accessdate=2015-03-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the London Data Store.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://data.london.gov.uk/ |title=London Datastore |publisher=Data.london.gov.uk |date= |accessdate=2015-03-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; The theory of open or "transparent" access to information enables greater innovation,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Hammell|first=Richard|title=Open Data:  Driving Growth, Ingenuity and Innovation|url=http://www.deloitte.com/assets/dcom-unitedkingdom/local%20assets/documents/market%20insights/deloitte%20analytics/uk-insights-deloitte-analytics-open-data-june-2012.pdf|publisher=Deloitte Consulting|accessdate=13 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  and makes for more efficient use of products and services, and thus supporting resilient communities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Brindley|first=William|title=How Open Data can Save Lives|url=http://forumblog.org/2013/01/how-open-data-can-save-lives/|publisher=World Economic Forum|accessdate=13 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Trust ===
The Sharing Economy relies on the will of the users to share, but in order to make an exchange, users have to be trustworthy and trust each other. Sharing economy organizations say they are committed to building and validating trusted relationships between members of their community, including producers, suppliers, customers or participants.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Charles|first=Green|title=Trusted and Being Trusted in the Sharing Economy|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/trustedadvisor/2012/05/02/trusting-and-being-trusted-in-the-sharing-economy/2/|accessdate=13 June 2013|newspaper=Forbes|date=May 2, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Beyond trusting others (i.e., the peers), the users of a Sharing Economy platform also have to trust the platform itself as well as the product at hand.&lt;ref name="trustppp"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Hawlitschek|first=Florian|last2=Teubner|first2=Timm|last3=Weinhardt|first3=Christof|date=2016 |title=Trust in the Sharing Economy|journal=Swiss Journal of Business Research and Practice|volume= 70|issue=1 |pages= 26–44 |doi=10.5771/0042-059X-2016-1-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Unused value is wasted value ===
Unused value refers to the time over which products, services and talents lay idle. This idle time is wasted value that business models and organizations that are based on sharing can potentially utilize.  The classic example is that the average car is unused 92% of the time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://energyseminar.stanford.edu/node/425 |title=Car Sharing and Pooling: Reducing Car Over-Population and Collaborative Consumption &amp;#124; Energy Seminar |publisher=Energyseminar.stanford.edu |date=2012-04-09 |accessdate=2015-03-13 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141123161330/http://energyseminar.stanford.edu/node/425 |archivedate=2014-11-23 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  This wasted value can be a significant resource, and hence an opportunity, for sharing economy car solutions. There is also significant unused value in "wasted time", as articulated by [[Clay Shirky]] in his analysis of power of "crowds" connected by information technology.  Many people have unused capacity in the course of their day.  With social media and information technology, such people can donate small slivers of time to take care of simple tasks that others need doing.  Examples of these [[Crowdsourcing|crowd sourced]] solutions&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Boudreau|first=Kevin|title=Using the Crowd as an Innovation Partner|url=http://hbr.org/2013/04/using-the-crowd-as-an-innovation-partner/|work=April 2013|publisher=Harvard Business Review|author2=Karim R. Lakhani }}&lt;/ref&gt;  include the for-profit [[Amazon Mechanical Turk]] and the non-profit [[Ushahidi]].

=== Waste as food ===
Waste is commonly considered as something that is no longer wanted and needs to be discarded. The challenge with this point of view is that much of what we define as waste still has value that, with proper design and distribution, can safely serve as "nutrients" for follow-on processes, unlocking new levels of value in increasingly scarce and expensive resources. One example is "[[Machine quilting#Heirloom machine quilting|heirloom design]]"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Bloyd-Peshkin|first=Sharon|title=Built to Trash|url=http://inthesetimes.com/article/5023/|accessdate=13 June 2013|newspaper=In These Times|date=October 21, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;  as articulated by physicist and inventor [[Saul Griffith]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Griffith|first=Saul|title=Everyday Inventions|url=http://www.ted.com/talks/saul_griffith_on_everyday_inventions.html|publisher=TED|accessdate=13 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Driving forces ==
The driving forces behind the rise of sharing economy organizations and businesses include:

* '''Information technology and social media:'''  A host of enabling technologies has reached the mainstream, making it easy for networks of people and organizations to transact directly and to scale the business.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Frey|first=Alexander|last2=Trenz|first2=Manuel|last3=Veit|first3=Daniel|date=2017|title=The Role of Technology for Service Innovation in Sharing Economy Organizations – a Service-Dominant Logic Perspective|url=http://aisel.aisnet.org/ecis2017_rp/121|journal=Proceedings of the 25th European Conference on Information Systems (ECIS)|language=en|volume=|pages=1885–1901|via=AISeL}}&lt;/ref&gt;  These include; open data,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Open Data Handbook|url=http://opendatahandbook.org/en/what-is-open-data/|work=2011, 2012|publisher=Open Knowledge Foundation|accessdate=13 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  the ubiquity and low-cost of mobile phones,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=ICT Facts and Figures, 2013|url=http://www.itu.int/en/ITU-D/Statistics/Documents/facts/ICTFactsFigures2013.pdf|work=2013|publisher=International Telecommunications Union|accessdate=13 June 2013|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130512042553/http://www.itu.int/en/ITU-D/Statistics/Documents/facts/ICTFactsFigures2013.pdf|archivedate=12 May 2013|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and social media.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Parr|first=Ben|title=What the F**k is Social Media?|url=http://mashable.com/2009/08/03/what-is-social-media/|accessdate=13 June 2013|newspaper=Mashable|date=August 3, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; These technologies dramatically reduce the friction of share-based business and organizational models.
* '''[[Social commerce]]:''' The notion that commerce is facilitated by social networking. It has contributed to the emergence of the sharing economy. People are more likely to buy products because of the "social influence exerted by peers on purchasing decisions".&lt;ref&gt;Hamari, Juho, Mimmi Sjöklint, and Antti Ukkonen. "The sharing economy: Why people participate in collaborative consumption." Journal of the Association for Information Science and Technology (2015).&lt;/ref&gt; The involvement of social media encourages and promotes the sharing economy and social commerce because it not only encourages people buy similar products and try similar things, but it also encourages people to look for group deals on these similar products as well. Group deals are proliferated by companies like [[Groupon]]. "Social commerce is moving beyond individual enjoyment and centering on economic concern. For instance, a pertinent form of social commerce is the consumer self-coordination of group deals for pursuit of economic gains."&lt;ref&gt;Wang, C., &amp; Zhang, P. (2012). The evolution of social commerce: The people, management, technology, and information dimensions. Communications of the Association for Information Systems, 31(1), 105–127.&lt;/ref&gt; "The results show that participation in sharing economy is motivated by many factors such as its sustainability, enjoyment of the activity as well as economic gains."&lt;ref&gt;Hamari, Juho, Mimmi Sjöklint, and Antti Ukkonen. "The Sharing Economy: Why People Participate in Collaborative Consumption." Journal of the Association for Information Science and Technology, 02 June 2015. Web. 02 Mar. 2017.&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''Urban lifestyle:''' The congested urban setting creates a new series of problems that can be addressed by the sharing economy. "Unlike earlier generations of information or technology-based enterprises, sharing enterprises rely on a critical mass of providers and consumers who are sufficiently close to each other or to other amenities to make their platforms work, often finding value in the very fact of the beneficial spillovers from proximity."&lt;ref&gt;Davidson, Nestor M. and John J. Infranca. "The Sharing Economy as an Urban Phenomenon." Yale Law &amp; Policy Review, vol. 34, no. 2, Spring2016, pp. 215-279. EBSCOhost, http://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&amp;db=a9h&amp;AN=118436221&amp;site=eds-live.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Uber (company)|Uber]], for example, takes people who live in one common area and transports them to another area. However, to make the initial pick up the Uber driver must be relatively close to the passenger. Urban settings inherently force people to live and work in close proximity. This means that the number of people going to and from similar destinations is going to increase. Uber realized this and created a business format to take advantage of this new urban setting. [[Airbnb]] is another example of a company that solves a problem created by the centralized urban setting. In urban settings where there is limited space for housing, people are always hard pressed to find cheaper housing and rental options when moving from city to city. AirBNB realized this and was able to take advantage of people who had space they aren’t using and rent it out at cheaper costs to the people who need a place to stay for shorter amounts of time.
* '''Increasing volatility in cost of natural resources:'''  Rising prosperity across the developing world coupled with population growth is putting greater strain on natural resources and has caused a spike in costs and market volatility.  This has been increasing pressure on traditional manufacturers to seek design, production and distribution alternatives that will stabilize costs and smooth projected expenditures.  In this context, the [[circular economy]] approach has been gaining interest among many global corporate actors.  While a handful of pioneering companies are leading the way, wider adoption will rely on mesh economy skills such as the collection and sharing of data, the spread of best practices, and increased collaboration.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Sharing brings major benefits to new mobility|url=https://www.wsp.com/en-GL/insights/sharing-brings-major-benefits-to-new-mobility|work=January, 2018|publisher=WSP Global|accessdate=9 Jan 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; An example of this could be taken from an interview by Arun Sundararajan with Ola CEO Bhavish Aggarwal suggesting that India’s rising middle class might ‘leap-frog’ car ownership all together and shift to ride-sharing given car ownerships large inefficiencies in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Sharing Economy: The End of Employment and the Rise of Crowd-Based Capitalism|last=Sundararajan|first=Arun|publisher=The MIT Press|year=2016|isbn=|location=Cambridge, MA|pages=116}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*'''Rising Costs:''' Once the increased costs of natural resources has been passed onto consumers they also begin to look for solutions within the sharing economy. Communities and companies like Visitours&lt;ref name=":7"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.visitours.io|title=Visitours|website=www.visitours.io|access-date=2018-10-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; look to reduce the costs of acquiring resources through sharing those resources with other whilst they're in use. Akin to reducing transaction costs as detailed [[Michael Munger]] in Tomorrow 3.0,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://doi.org/10.1017/9781108602341|title=Tomorrow 3.0|last=Munger|first=Michael C.|date=2018-03-07|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=9781108602341|language=en|doi=10.1017/9781108602341}}&lt;/ref&gt; Visitours&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt; allows travellers to use the same resources but splits the fixed costs of doing so by sharing them. Unlike Uber or Airbnb, this type of collaborative consumption reduces the amount of excess capacity in the economy without commoditising the assets that it relies on.

''Forbes'' estimates the revenue flowing through the shared economy would surpass $3.5 billion in 2013, with growth exceeding 25%.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Geron|first=Tobio|title=Airbnb and the Unstoppable Rise of the Share Economy|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/tomiogeron/2013/01/23/airbnb-and-the-unstoppable-rise-of-the-share-economy/|accessdate=13 June 2013|newspaper=Forbes|date=January 23, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Encompassing many of the listed benefits of the sharing economy is the idea of the freelance worker. Through monetizing unused assets, such as renting out a spare guest room on Airbnb, or providing personal services to others, such as becoming a driver with Uber, people are in effect becoming freelance workers. Freelance work entails better opportunity for employment, as well as more flexibility for workers, as people have the ability to pick and choose the time and place of their work. As freelance workers, people can plan around their existing schedules and maintain multiple jobs if needed. Evidence of the appeal to this type of work can be seen from a survey conducted by the Freelancers Union, which shows that around 34% of the U.S. population is involved in freelance work.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://fortune.com/2015/07/20/uber-and-the-sharing-economy/|title=3 reasons to cheer Uber and the sharing economy|last=Kumar|first=S.|date=July 20, 2015|website=Fortune|access-date=2017-05-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to an article by Margarita Hakobyan, freelance work can also be beneficial for small businesses. During their early developmental stages, many small companies can’t afford or aren’t in need of full-time departments, but rather require specialized work for a certain project or for a short period of time. With freelance workers offering their services in the sharing economy, firms are able to save money on long-term labor costs, and increase marginal revenue from their operations.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.business.com/articles/how-to-use-the-sharing-economy-to-benefit-your-business/|title=The Sharing Economy Benefits Business|last=Hakobyan|first=Margarita|date=February 22, 2017|work=Business.com|access-date=2017-05-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Researcher Christopher Koopman, an author of a{{which|date=May 2016}} study by [[George Mason University]] economists, said the sharing economy "allows people to take idle capital and turn them into revenue sources." He has stated, "People are taking spare bedroom[s], cars, tools they are not using and becoming their own entrepreneurs."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Afp |url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/wires/afp/article-2939000/Sharing-economy-reshapes-markets-complaints-rise.html |title='Sharing economy' reshapes markets, as complaints rise &amp;#124; Daily Mail Online |publisher=Dailymail.co.uk |date=2015-02-03 |accessdate=2015-03-13 |location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Arun Sundararajan]], a New York University economist who studies the sharing economy, told a congressional hearing that "this transition will have a positive impact on economic growth and welfare, by stimulating new consumption, by raising productivity, and by catalyzing individual innovation and entrepreneurship".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.stern.nyu.edu/experience-stern/news-events/prof-arun-sundararajan-s-congressional-testimony-sharing-economy-cited |title=Uber Said to Seek $1.5 Billion in Funds at $50 Billion Valuation |publisher=Bloomberb Business |date=2015-05-19 |accessdate=2015-07-09}}{{unreliable source?|date=May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{unreliable source?|date=May 2016}}

A study in Intereconomics / The Review of European Economic Policy noted that the sharing economy has the potential to bring many benefits for the economy, while noting that this presupposes that the success of sharing economy services reflects their business models rather than 'regulatory arbitrage' from avoiding the regulation that affects traditional businesses.&lt;ref&gt;Munkoe, M. (2017) Regulating the European Sharing Economy: State of Play and Challenges. Intereconomics / The Review of European Economic Policy. Volume 52, January/February 2017, Number 1 | pp. 38-44&lt;/ref&gt;

One benefit of sharing economy is that it can help us in some specific scenes. For example, when your phone has less 20% battery, you may need a sharing charger. The power bank-sharing concept works as follows: Through an app, users locate a shared-charger station, scan a QR code, pay a deposit, and borrow a power bank. The battery packs can be returned to any charging station. In the case of LeDian, the company allowed customers to use the power banks free of charge for the first 24 hours after paying a 50-yuan ($7.60) deposit. After the first day, users were charged 2 yuan per day for the service.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.sixthtone.com/news/1000996/shared-charger-startup-pulls-plug|title=Shared-Charger Startup Pulls Plug|last=Tone|first=Sixth|date=12 October 2017|work=Sixth Tone|access-date=2018-11-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An independent data study conducted by [[Busbud]] compared the average price of hotel rooms with the average price of Airbnb listings in thirteen major cities in the United States. The research concluded that in nine of the thirteen cities, Airbnb rates were lower than hotel rates by an average price of $34.56.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.busbud.com/blog/airbnb-vs-hotel-rates/|title=Comparing Airbnb and Hotel Rates Around the Globe {{!}} Busbud blog|date=2016-02-18|newspaper=Busbud blog|language=en-US|access-date=2016-12-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; A further study conducted by Busbud compared the average hotel rate with the average Airbnb rate in eight major European cities.

== Transport ==
{{further|Uber (company)|Lyft}}
Using a personal car to transport passengers or deliveries requires payment, or sufferance, of [[cost]]s for fees deducted by the dispatching company, fuel, wear and tear, depreciation, interest, taxes, as well as adequate insurance. The driver is typically not paid for driving to an area where fares might be found in the volume necessary for high earnings, or driving to the location of a pickup or returning from a drop-off point.&lt;ref name=Philly5715&gt;{{cite news|author1=Emily Guendelsberger|title=I was an undercover Uber driver|url=http://citypaper.net/uberdriver/|accessdate=May 10, 2015|work=Philadelphia Citypaper|date=May 7, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Mobile app]]s have been written that help a driver be aware of and manage such costs has been introduced.&lt;ref name=NYT5915&gt;{{cite news|author1=Natasha Singer and Mike Isaac|title=An App That Helps Drivers Earn the Most From Their Trips|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2015/05/10/technology/a-dashboard-management-consultant.html|accessdate=May 10, 2015|work=The New York Times|date=May 9, 2015|quote=At first I thought I was earning money}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Uber, Airbnb, and other companies have had drastic effects on infrastructures such as road congestion and housing. Major cities such as San Francisco and New York City have become even more congested due to ride sharing. According to transportation analyst Charles Komanoff, "Uber-caused congestion has reduced traffic speeds in downtown Manhattan by around 8 percent".&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

''[[The New York Times]]'' wrote that there was a recent corporate decision by Uber which aimed at lowering its fare rates by 15% in over 100 cities in the United States.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite news

}}&lt;/ref&gt; This decision caused many Uber employee drivers to assemble and express their disagreement with the recent pay cut. Uber made a statement claiming that when it cut prices previously, "the amount of time drivers spent waiting for fares fell, meaning drivers did more business and ultimately earned more money".&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

A number of academics recently demonstrated that in 2015, Uber generated $6.8 billion of consumer welfare in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/view/articles/2016-09-08/computing-the-social-value-of-uber-it-s-high|title=Computing the Social Value of Uber.

===Local delivery===
The sharing economy model of Uber has been replicated in other similar areas. Ride sharing economy gave birth to food and grocery delivery systems. Uber launched a food-ordering app called UberEATS which not only allows users to order food, but also enables users to register to be UberEATS drivers. Similar to Uber drivers, UberEATS drivers get paid for delivering food.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ridesharingdriver.com/driving-for-ubereats-what-its-like-delivering-food-for-uber/|title=Driving for UberEats: What it’s like delivering food for Uber|date=29 March 2016|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; An example of grocery delivery in sharing economy is Instakart. It has the same business model as that of sharing economy based companies like Uber, Airbnb, or CanYa.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2014/05/22/technology/personaltech/online-grocery-start-up-takes-page-from-sharing-services.html|title=Grocery Deliveries in Sharing Economy|first=Farhad|last=Manjoo|date=21 May 2014|publisher=|via=NYTimes.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; Instacart uses resources that are readily available, and the shoppers shop at existing grocery shops. The contract workers use their personal vehicles to deliver groceries to customers. Instacart manages to keep its cost low as it does not require any infrastructure to store goods. In addition to having contract workers, Instacart allows signing up to be a "personal shopper" for Instacart through its official web page.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://money.cnn.com/2015/06/22/technology/instacart-employee-option/index.html|title=The Uber effect: Instacart shifts away from contract workers|last=O'Brien|first=Sara Ashley|date=2015-06-22|website=CNNMoney|access-date=2017-04-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2015/04/30/technology/personaltech/instacarts-bet-on-online-grocery-shopping.html|title=Instacart’s Bet on Online Grocery Shopping|last=Manjoo|first=Farhad|date=2015-04-29|work=The New York Times|access-date=2017-04-02|issn=0362-4331}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Criticism and controversies ==
The ''Harvard Business Review'' argues that "sharing economy" is a misnomer, and that the correct word for this activity is [[access economy]]. The authors say, "When "sharing" is market-mediated—when a company is an intermediary between consumers who don't know each other—it is no longer sharing at all. Rather, consumers are paying to access someone else's goods or services."&lt;ref name="Harvard Business Review" /&gt; The article goes on to show that companies (such as Uber) who understand this, and whose marketing highlights the financial benefits to participants, are successful, while companies (such as Lyft) whose marketing highlights the social benefits of the service are less successful.

The notion of "sharing economy" has often been considered as an oxymoron, and a misnomer for actual commercial exchanges.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = What's yours is mine|last = Slee|first = Tom|publisher = OR Books|year = 2015|isbn = 1-68219-022-6|location = New York|pages = 216}}&lt;/ref&gt; Arnould and Rose&lt;ref name="Mutuality: Critique and substitute for Belk's sharing"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Arnould|first=Eric.

A distinction can therefore be made between free mutualization such as genuine sharing and for-profit mutualization in the likes of Uber, Airbnb, or Taskrabbit.&lt;ref name="two-sided role"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Ertz|first=Myriam |last2=Durif|first2=Fabien|last3=Arcand|first3=Manon|date=2016 |title=Collaborative consumption or the rise of the two-sided consumer|ssrn=2799886 |journal=International Journal of Business and Management|volume=6|number=6}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Laurell|first=Christofer|last2=Sandström|first2=Christian|date=June 2016|title=Analysing Uber in social media – disruptive technology or institutional disruption?|url=http://www.worldscientific.com/doi/pdf/10.1142/S1363919616400132|journal=International Journal of Innovation Management|volume=20|issue=5|pages=1640013|doi=10.1142/S1363919616400132|pmid=|access-date=28 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;
To Ritzer,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Ritzer|first=George|title=Prosumption: Evolution, revolution, or eternal return of the same?|journal=Journal of Consumer Culture|year=2014|volume=14|number=1|url=http://joc.sagepub.com/content/14/1/3|accessdate=24 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; this current trend towards increased consumer input in commercial exchanges refers to the notion of [[prosumption]], which, as such, is not new. The mutualization of resources is for example well known in [[business-to-business]] (B2B) like heavy machinery in [[agriculture]] and [[forestry]] as well as in business-to-consumer (B2C) like [[Self-service laundry|self-service laundries]]. But three major drivers enable consumer-to-consumer (C2C) mutualization of resources for a broad variety of new goods and services as well as new industries. First, customer behaviour for many goods and services changes from ownership to sharing. Second, online social networks and electronic markets more easily link consumers. And third, mobile devices and electronic services make the use of shared goods and services more convenient (e.g. smartphone app instead of physical key).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Du Web 2.0 a la seconde vie des objets: Le role de la technologie internet|last = Ertz|first = Myriam|publisher = GRIN Verlag|year = 2015|isbn = 3-668-04210-1|location = Munich|pages = 52}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Salon'' writes that "the sharing economy ... [is] not the Internet '[[gift economy]]' as originally conceived, a utopia in which we all benefit from our voluntary contributions. It's something quite different—the relentless co-optation of the gift economy by market capitalism. The sharing economy, as practiced by Silicon Valley, is a betrayal of the gift economy. The [[potlatch]] has been paved over, and replaced with a digital shopping mall."&lt;ref&gt;[[Andrew Leonard]], [http://www.salon.com/2014/03/14/sharing_economy_shams_deception_at_the_core_of_the_internets_hottest_businesses/ "Sharing economy" shams: Deception at the core of the Internet's hottest businesses], ''[[Salon.com]]'', 2014.03.14&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Andrew Leonard]], [http://www.salon.com/2014/02/17/youre_not_fooling_us_uber_8_reasons_why_the_sharing_economy_is_all_about_corporate_greed/ You're not fooling us, Uber! 8 reasons why the "sharing economy" is all about corporate greed], ''[[Salon.com]]'', 2014.02.17&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Tom Slee, [http://www.salon.com/2014/01/28/the_big_business_behind_the_sharing_economy_partner/ The secret libertarianism of Uber &amp; Airbnb], ''[[Salon.com]]'', 2014.01.28&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Anya Kamenetz]], [http://www.salon.com/2013/09/30/airbnb_wins_new_york_court_victory_newscred/ AirBnb wins New York court victory, but the city still present challenges for the popular room-finding site], ''[[Fast Company (magazine)|Fast Company]]'' and ''[[Salon (website)|Salon]]'', 2013.09.30&lt;/ref&gt;

Oxford Internet Institute, Economic Geographer, Graham has argued that key parts of the sharing economy impose a new balance of power onto workers.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://newint.org/blog/2016/05/25/digital-work-marketplaces-impose-a-new-balance-of-power/|title=Digital work marketplaces impose a new balance of power|last=Graham|first=Mark|website=New Internationalist|access-date=2016-11-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; By bringing together workers in low- and high-income countries, gig economy platforms that are not geographically-confined can bring about a 'race to the bottom' for workers.

=== Relationship to job loss ===
''[[New York (magazine)|New York Magazine]]'' wrote that the sharing economy has succeeded in large part because the real economy has been struggling. Specifically, in the magazine's view, the sharing economy succeeds because of a depressed labor market, in which "lots of people are trying to fill holes in their income by monetizing their stuff and their labor in creative ways", and in many cases, people join the sharing economy because they've recently lost a full-time job, including a few cases where the pricing structure of the sharing economy may have made their old jobs less profitable (e.g. full-time taxi drivers who may have switched to [[Lyft]] or [[Uber (company)|Uber]]). The magazine writes that "In almost every case, what compels people to open up their homes and cars to complete strangers is money, not trust. ... Tools that help people trust in the kindness of strangers might be pushing hesitant sharing-economy participants over the threshold to adoption. But what's getting them to the threshold in the first place is a damaged economy, and harmful public policy that has forced millions of people to look to odd jobs for sustenance."&lt;ref&gt;Kevin Roose, [http://nymag.com/daily/intelligencer/2014/04/sharing-economy-is-about-desperation.html The Sharing Economy Isn't About Trust, It's About Desperation] (2014-04-24), ''[[New York (magazine)|New York Magazine]]''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Kevin Roose, [http://nymag.com/daily/intelligencer/2014/09/silicon-valleys-contract-worker-problem.html Does Silicon Valley Have a Contract-Worker Problem?] (2014-09-18), ''[[New York (magazine)|New York Magazine]]''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bloombergview.com/articles/2014-10-02/a-secret-of-uber-s-success-struggling-workers A Secret of Uber's Success: Struggling Workers] (2014-10-02), ''[[Bloomberg.com]]''&lt;/ref&gt;

According to [[CBS News]] there is also Uber's "audacious plan to replace human drivers"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cbsnews.com/news/ubers-audacious-plan-to-replace-human-drivers/|title=Uber's audacious plan to replace human drivers|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Once companies like Uber replace human drivers with driverless cars, further job loss will occur as even freelance driving will be replaced by automation.

However, [[Carl Benedikt Frey]] found that while the introduction of Uber had not led to jobs being lost, but had caused a reduction in the incomes of incumbent taxi drivers of almost 10 percent.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.oxfordmartin.ox.ac.uk/publications/view/2387 ''Drivers of Disruption? Estimating the Uber Effect'']&lt;/ref&gt;

''[[HuffPost]]'' wrote that some people believe the [[Great Recession|recent recession]] led to the expansion of the sharing economy because people could easily employ themselves through the services that these companies offer. However, this concept is only hiding the fact that such employment is only a new face for contractual work and temporary employment that doesn't provide the necessary safeguards for modern living. When companies use contract based employment, the "advantage for a business of using such non-regular workers is obvious: It can lower labor costs dramatically, often by 30 percent, since it is not responsible for health benefits, social security, unemployment or injured workers' compensation, paid sick or vacation leave and more. Contract workers, who are barred from forming unions and have no grievance procedure, can be dismissed without notice".&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web

=== Circumventing labor protection law ===
[[Xconomy]] wrote about the debate over the status of the workers within the sharing economy, whether they should be treated as [[Independent contractor|contract workers]] or [[Employment|employees]] of the companies. This issue seems to be most relevant among sharing economy companies such as Uber. The reason this has become such a big issue is that the two types of workers are treated very differently. Contract workers are not guaranteed any benefits and pay can be below average. However, if they are employees, they are granted access to benefits and pay is generally higher. The State of California is trying to go after Uber and make them pay a fine to compensate workers fairly. The [[California Public Utilities Commission]] was working on a case that "addresses the same underlying issue seen in the contract worker controversy—whether the new ways of operating in the sharing economy model should be subject to the same regulations governing traditional businesses".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Like Uber, Instakart too had to face similar lawsuits. In 2015, a lawsuit was filed against Instakart alleging the company misclassified a person who buys and delivers groceries as independent contractor.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.latimes.com/business/technology/la-fi-himi-apoorva-mehta-20170105-story.html|title=Apoorva Mehta had 20 failed start-ups before Instacart|date=2017-01-27|work=Los Angeles Times|access-date=2017-04-02|language=en-US|issn=0458-3035}}&lt;/ref&gt; Instakart had to eventually make all such people as part-time employees and had to accord benefits such as health insurance to those qualifying. This led to Instakart having thousands of employees overnight from zero.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

On the other hand, a 2015 article by economists at George Mason University argued that many of the regulations circumvented by sharing economy businesses are exclusive privileges lobbied for by interest groups.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Koopman|first=Christopher|last2=Mitchell|first2=Matthew D.|last3=Thierer|first3=Adam D.|date=2015-05-15|title=The Sharing Economy and Consumer Protection Regulation: The Case for Policy Change|ssrn=2535345|journal=The Journal of Business, Entrepreneurship &amp; the Law|volume=8|pages=530–545|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Workers and entrepreneurs not connected to the interest groups engaging in this rent-seeking behavior are thus restricted from entry into the market. For example, taxi unions lobbying a city government to restrict the number of cabs allowed on the road prevents larger numbers of drivers from entering in the marketplace.

The same research finds that while sharing economy workers do lack the protections that exist in the traditional economy,&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; many of them cannot actually find work in the traditional economy.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; In this sense, they are taking advantage of opportunities which the traditional regulatory framework has not been able to provide for them. As the sharing economy grows, governments at all levels are reevaluating how to adjust their regulatory schemes to accommodate these workers.

Research by [[Carl Benedikt Frey]] found that the "sharing economy" has had substantial negative impacts on workers wages.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.oxfordmartin.ox.ac.uk/downloads/academic/Uber_Drivers_of_Disruption.pdf|title=Drivers of Disruption|last=Frey|first=Carl Benedikt|date=|website=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Similarly, In the context of online freelancing marketplaces, there have been worries that the sharing economy could result in a 'race to the bottom' in terms or wages and benefits: as millions of new workers from low-income countries come online.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://newint.org/blog/2016/05/25/digital-work-marketplaces-impose-a-new-balance-of-power/|title=Digital work marketplaces impose a new balance of power|last=Graham|first=Mark|date=2016|work=New Internationalist|access-date=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://usilive.org/opinions/organising-in-the-digital-wild-west-can-strategic-bottlenecks-help-prevent-a-race-to-the-bottom-for-online-workers/|title=Organising in the "digital wild west": can strategic bottlenecks help prevent a race to the bottom for online workers?|last=Graham|first=Mark|date=2016|work=Union Solidarity International|access-date=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Susie Cagle]] wrote that the benefits big sharing economy players might be making for themselves are "not exactly" trickling down, and that the sharing economy "doesn't build trust" because where it builds new connections, it often "replicates old patterns of privileged access for some, and denial for others".&lt;ref&gt;[https://medium.com/the-nib/the-case-against-sharing-9ea5ba3d216d The Case Against Sharing: On access, scarcity, and trust] (2014-05-28), [[Susie Cagle]], ''[[Medium (service)|Medium.com]]''&lt;/ref&gt;  William Alden wrote that "The so-called sharing economy is supposed to offer a new kind of capitalism, one where regular folks, enabled by efficient online platforms, can turn their fallow assets into cash machines ... But the reality is that these markets also tend to attract a class of well-heeled professional operators, who outperform the amateurs—just like the rest of the economy".&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2014/11/30/magazine/the-business-tycoons-of-airbnb.html?action=click&amp;pgtype=Homepage&amp;module=c-column-middle-span-region&amp;region=c-column-middle-span-region&amp;WT.nav=c-column-middle-span-region The Business Tycoons of Airbnb], ''[[The New York Times]]''&lt;/ref&gt;

The local economic benefit of the sharing economy is offset by its current form, which is that huge tech companies reap a great deal of the profit in many cases. For example, Uber, which is estimated to be worth $50B as of mid-2015,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Afp |url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2015-05-09/uber-said-to-seek-1-5-billion-in-funds-at-50-billion-valuation |title='Sharing economy' reshapes markets, as complaints rise &amp;#124; Daily Mail Online |publisher=Dailymail.co.uk |date=2015-02-03 |accessdate=2015-03-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; takes up to 30% commission from the gross revenue of its drivers,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url= https://www.forbes.com/sites/ellenhuet/2015/05/18/uber-new-uberx-tiered-commission-30-percent/ |title= Uber Tests Taking Even More From Its Drivers With 30% Commission |publisher=Forbes |date=2015-05-18 |accessdate=2015-07-09 |first=Ellen |last=Huet}}&lt;/ref&gt; leaving many drivers making less than minimum wage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.msn.com/en-us/news/us/a-philadelphia-journalist-went-undercover-as-an-uber-driver-%E2%80%94-heres-how-much-she-made/ar-BBjuRkA|title= A Philadelphia journalist went undercover as an Uber driver — here's how much she made|publisher=MSN |date=2015-05-09 |accessdate=2015-07-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is reminiscent of a peak [[Rentier state]] "which derives all or a substantial portion of its national revenues from the rent of indigenous resources to external clients".

=== Other issues ===
''[[Business Insider]]'' wrote that companies such as Airbnb and [[Uber (company)|Uber]] do not share their reputation data with the very users who it belongs to. This is an issue since no matter how well people behave on any one platform, their reputation doesn't travel with them. This fragmentation has some negative consequences, such as the Airbnb squatters who had previously deceived Kickstarter users to the tune of $40,000.&lt;ref&gt;Kevin Montgomery, [http://valleywag.gawker.com/airbnb-squatters-are-also-kickstarter-swindlers-1612099912 Airbnb Squatters Also Swindled $40,000 From Kickstarter], 2014-07-28&lt;/ref&gt; Sharing data between these platforms could have prevented the repeat incident. Business Insider's view is that since the sharing economy is in its infancy, this has been accepted. However, as the industry matures, this will need to change.&lt;ref&gt;Patrick J. Stewart, [http://www.businessinsider.com/reputation-and-the-sharing-economy-2014-10 Reputation And The Sharing Economy] (2014-10-23), "[[Business Insider]]&lt;/ref&gt;

Giana Eckhardt and Fleura Bardhi say that the sharing economy promotes and prioritizes cheap fares and low costs rather than personal relationships, which is tied to similar issues in crowdsourcing. For example, Zipcar is advertised as a ride-sharing service, but it's been brought into consideration that the consumers reap similar benefits from Zipcar as they would from, say, a hotel. In this example, there is minimal social interaction going on and the primary concern is the low cost. Other examples many include myriad other sharing economies such as AirBnB or Uber. Because of this, the "sharing economy" may not be about sharing but rather about access. Giana Eckhardt and Fleura Bardhi say the "sharing" economy has taught people to prioritize cheap and easy access over interpersonal communication, and the value of going the extra mile for those interactions has diminished.&lt;ref&gt;Giana Eckhardt and Fleura Bardhi, [https://hbr.org/2015/01/the-sharing-economy-isnt-about-sharing-at-all The Sharing Economy isn't About Sharing at All] (2015-02-09), ''[[Harvard Business Review]]''&lt;/ref&gt; In light of the discussion on sharing economy versus access economy, the business models of the sharing economy platforms are also under examination. The escrow-like model practiced by several of the largest sharing economy platforms, in which they facilitate and handle contracting and payments on behalf of their subscribers, further underlines an emphasis on access and transaction rather than on sharing.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.perfectklik.com/en/blog/post/1|title=The PerfectKLIK Way - Blog - PerfectKLIK|last=PerfectKLIK|website=www.perfectklik.com|language=en|access-date=2017-08-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The sharing economy has also caused many issues as it often becomes ambiguous as to what the workers' roles are inside of these gig companies. For example, Uber has had many issues over the debate about if their drivers are considered registered taxi drivers or independent contractors.&lt;ref name="Malhotra 24–27"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Malhotra|first=Arvind|date=November 2014|title=The Dark Side of the Sharing Economy...and How to Lighten It.|url=|journal=Communications of the ACM|volume=57|pages=24–27|via=EBSCOhost}}&lt;/ref&gt; This debate has caused Uber to have to remove their presence in several locations such as Alaska. Uber stirred up a large controversy in Alaska because if Uber drivers were considered registered taxi drivers, that would mean they would be entitled to receiving workers' compensation insurance. However, if they were considered independent contractors they would not receive these same benefits. Due to all of the disputes, Uber decided to pull their services from the Alaskan market.&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/travel/news-and-advice/uber-ban-countries-where-world-taxi-app-europe-taxi-us-states-china-asia-legal-a7707436.html|title=These are all the places in the world that have banned Uber|last=Rhodes|first=Anna|date=2017-04-28|work=The Independent|access-date=2017-05-30|language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, ride-share drivers’ status continues to be ambiguous when it comes to legal matters. On New Year’s Eve in 2013, an off-duty driver for Uber killed a pedestrian while looking for a rider. Since the driver was considered a contractor, Uber would not compensate the victim’s family. The contract states that the service is a matching platform and “the company does not provide transportation services, and … has no liability for services... provided by third parties.”&lt;ref name="Malhotra 24–27"/&gt;

It has been discovered that sharing firms have used their power over consumers and labor for unethical business practices. In March 2017, it was shown that Uber used its platform to target regulatory officials. By using software named 'Greyball', Uber was able to make it difficult for officials to get rides on the application. Other schemes implemented by Uber include using its application to show 'phantom' cars nearby to consumers on the app, implying shorter pick-up times than could actually be expected. Uber also changes its contracts and commission clauses so much that it confuses drivers as to their terms of employment.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Calo, R. &amp; Rosenblat, A.|first=|date=October 2017|title=The Taking Economy: Uber, Information, and Power|jstor=44392959|journal=Columbia Law Review|volume=117 |issue=6|pages=1629–1631}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The sharing economy has also caused issues because many companies have skyrocketed in this new economy and have almost completely replaced the traditional companies that came before them, that offered the same services. Regulations that cover traditional taxi companies but not ride sharing services can put taxis at a competitive disadvantage.&lt;ref name="Malhotra 24–27"/&gt; Returning to the Uber example, Uber has faced many problems worldwide due to the fact that it has taken a large chunk of customers away from traditional taxi companies. Uber has also been banned from several countries or districts including China, Taiwan, Italy, and many others. This is mainly due to the fact that countries saw the company as an unfair competition to taxi services and created laws and regulations against Uber to help benefit taxi companies.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;

====Theft====
A sharing service, named ''Sharing E Umbrella''  was started in 11 cities across China in 2017 lost almost all of the 300,000 [[umbrellas]] placed out for sharing purposes during the first few weeks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=He |first=Huifeng |url=http://www.scmp.com/news/china/society/article/2101722/chinese-umbrella-sharing-firm-remains-upbeat-despite-losing-most |title=Chinese umbrella-sharing firm remains upbeat despite losing most of its 300,000 brollies |work=[[South China Morning Post]] |date=2017-07-07 |accessdate=2017-07-11 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Justifications===
The disintermediation and informal nature of community-based platforms such as Uber and Airbnb (from the collaborative economy), may exacerbate old problems and spawn new challenges. Such platforms may indeed be ethically and morally questionable and thus constitute controversial consumption schemes. Henceforth, a study&lt;ref name="morally"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Ertz|first=Myriam |last2=Lecompte|first2=Agnes|last3=Durif|first3=Fabien|date=2016 |title=It's not my fault, I am in the right: Exploration of neutralization in the justification of the support and use of a controversial technological collaborative consumption service|volume=134|pages=254–264|url=https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Myriam_Ertz/publication/326046153_It%27s_not_my_fault_I_am_in_the_right_Exploration_of_neutralization_in_the_justification_of_the_support_and_use_of_a_controversial_technological_collaborative_consumption_service/links/5b6453cd0f7e9b00b2a33445/Its-not-my-fault-I-am-in-the-right-Exploration-of-neutralization-in-the-justification-of-the-support-and-use-of-a-controversial-technological-collaborative-consumption-service.pdf|journal=Technological Forecasting &amp; Social Change|doi=10.1016/j.techfore.2018.06.032}}&lt;/ref&gt; used Sykes and Matza's (1957) classic neutralization theory, from the field of criminology to identify how supporters and users of community-based platforms justify the existence of controversial consumption systems such as community-based platforms.&lt;ref name="morally"/&gt; Interestingly, to justify these platforms, suppors and users both tend to depend heaily on neutralization techniques such as appealing to higher loyalty (e.g., the good for society, the free and fair competition), condemnation of condemners (e.g. Taxi drivers in the case of Uber, hotel chains in the case of Airbnb), denial of victims (i.e., taxi drivers and hotel employees are not victims), denial of responsibility (i.e., Uber and Airbnb are not to blame, the State is), and invokation of normalcy (i.e., these platforms are going to become the norm anyway, or it is the norm in other cities or countries). Also, these techniques are used in conjunction with non-neutralization techniques to defend controversial collaborative services such as Uber.&lt;ref name="morally"/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6551">"'''Some Words with a Mummy'''" is a satirical [[short story]] by [[Edgar Allan Poe]]. It was first published in ''[[American Review: A Whig Journal]]'' in April 1845. 

==Plot==
Doctor Ponnonner invites the narrator to his home to take part in a mummy unwrapping. They cut into the first sarcophagus, remove it and discover the mummy's name, Allamistakeo. The second and third sarcophagi are removed to reveal the body, placed in a papyrus sheath, covered in plaster and decorated with painting and gold gilt. After removing this, they examine the body. They find it to be in exceptionally good condition, although it does not seem to have been embalmed in the normal way as the skin is red and there are no incisions.

The doctor lays out instruments for the dissection, but the men suggest using electricity on the mummy and they begin preparations for this at once. The amount of electricity causes the mummy to awaken and condemn the men for their abuse. The men make their apologies to Allamistakeo, explain to him why they dissect mummies and the scientific importance of it. Satisfied with the explanation and their apologies Allamistakeo shakes hands with the men, who then proceed to patch up the damage caused by their incisions. They gather up proper clothes for Allamistakeo and sit down for cigars and wine.

Allamistakeo explains how he came to be a mummy - ancient Egyptians had a significantly longer life span than modern men - about one thousand years - they were also able to be embalmed - this process arrested the bodily functions allowing them to sleep through hundreds of years only to rise and go on with their lives centuries later. Allamistakeo again chastises the men for their ignorance of Egyptian history. He then explains that throughout time man has always been monotheistic, the pagan gods were symbols of the various aspects of the one true god. The men ask him, as he is over five thousand years old, if he knows anything about how the universe was created ten thousand years ago. Allamistakeo responds that no one during his time entertained the fantasy that the universe was ever created, but that it always existed, although, some believed that humans were created by spontaneous generation. To this Allamistakeo has to accept defeat and, in triumph, the men disperse.

==Publication history==
In January 1845, ''Columbian Magazine'' listed "Some Words with a Mummy" as scheduled for publication; Poe likely pulled the article when he was offered more money for it elsewhere.&lt;ref&gt;Thomas, Dwight &amp; David K. Jackson. ''The Poe Log: A Documentary Life of Edgar Allan Poe, 1809–1849''. Boston: G. K. Hall &amp; Co., 1987: 484. {{ISBN|0-7838-1401-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was ultimately published in the April 1845 edition of the ''American Review'',&lt;ref name=Sova224&gt;Sova, Dawn B. ''Edgar Allan Poe: A to Z''. New York: Checkmark Books, 2001: 224. {{ISBN|0-8160-4161-X}}&lt;/ref&gt; which also included Poe's revised poems "The Valley of Unrest" and "[[The City in the Sea]]".&lt;ref&gt;Thomas, Dwight &amp; David K. Jackson. ''The Poe Log: A Documentary Life of Edgar Allan Poe, 1809–1849''. Boston: G. K. Hall &amp; Co., 1987: 522. {{ISBN|0-7838-1401-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; The story was republished without changes shortly after in the November 1, 1845, issue of the ''[[Broadway Journal]]''.&lt;ref name=Sova224/&gt;

==Analysis ==
{{Section OR|date=November 2010}}
This story is a [[satire]] of two things. First the popular interest in [[Egyptology]] and mummies during the time that this story was written. Secondly the prevailing thought that in the West  humanity had reached the height of civilization and knowledge due to the scientific and industrial revolutions.

=== Satire of Egyptmania ===
Poe is clearly poking fun at Egyptmania in this story. In the story a group of men gather together in the middle of the night to examine a mummy for the sake of "scientific discovery". During their examination they act like a group of children that just got a new toy. They poke and prod the mummy just to see what happens, this is evident when they decide to use electricity. The fact that this is going on at the Doctor's private residence and is attended by his friends only, even though they do not have any kind of medical expertise denotes this fact. Although it seems, in modern times, counterproductive to conduct a serious scientific examination in a party like atmosphere, this was commonly done at the time, a fact that Poe is ridiculing here. The mummy is also a method of ridicule here, right down to its name, Allamistakeo. Unlike serious mummy horror stories, the mummy is not scary, and the characters do not react to it as such. It is another device that Poe uses to censure the reader. Upon its resurrection, the mummy chastises the men for their abuse of himself and mummies in general.

===Satire of science and knowledge ===
In their discussion with Allamistakeo, the men attempt to exalt their time as one of unprecedented knowledge and technology. Again and again, Allamistakeo is able to prove that the technology in his time was not inferior, and often superior, to the modern equivalents. The narrator, who at first is presented as an intelligent, educated man, is later revealed to be completely ignorant. He asks Allamistakeo a series of questions intended to prove that modern technology is superior and each time he asks questions that, ultimately, support Allamistakeo's argument. Even when one of the men tries to stop him and suggests that he consult historical texts before asking his questions, he continues. When the man mentions Ptolemy, the narrator's response is "whoever Ptolemy is".  In the end, the only reason the men can consider themselves the victors of the debate comes down to cough drops.

==Adaptations==
The story was adapted as a one-act opera, ''Allamistakeo'', by [[Giulio Viozzi]] in 1954.

'''StyleNite''' is a cultural event organized by Berlin's designer [[Michael Michalsky]]. It has evolved from Michalsky's fashion shows and takes place twice a year during [[Berlin Fashion Week]]. Since January 2010 the event is officially titled ''StyleNite''.
&lt;br /&gt;
The event is breaking with the traditions of a conventional [[fashion show]], by combining performances of different art disciplines. Each StyleNite is themed according to the inspirational topic of the latest collection of the designer Michalsky.

== Event concept ==
Michalsky is considered a „seismograph of society"&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/berlin-became-coolest-city-planet-97748 How Berlin Became the Coolest City], www.hollywoodreporter.com, accessed on 8 September 2011&lt;/ref&gt; and his collections are regularly influenced by current developments in society. These topics are picked up as central theme of the StyleNite with the aim to support a free and tolerant exchange between artists and art disciplines. In this respect, the StyleNite is considered a platform for exchange, discussion and contacts. Inherent part of the StyleNite are Michalsky's fashion shows. Alternating locations and elaborate stage-designs are setting the scene for further performances during the event. Part of the program are always live music acts of famous or newcomer bands, show performances, film premieres and fashion shows of other labels.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bunte.de/lifestyle/fashion/fashion-week-promireigen-bei-michalsky-und-co-_aid_14583.html Celebrity parade at Michalsky] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120323020455/http://www.bunte.de/lifestyle/fashion/fashion-week-promireigen-bei-michalsky-und-co-_aid_14583.html |date=23 March 2012 }}, www.bunte.de, accessed on 8 September 2011&lt;/ref&gt; The evening ends with an excessive after show party.

In March 2011 Michalsky announced that the following four StyleNites are going to take place at the [[Tempodrom]] in Berlin.

&lt;/gallery&gt;

=== Models ===
Besides famous models there are always new faces to be spotted at StyleNite.

Michalsky has always ignored the „traditional" requirements for models regarding age, origin and perfection. He would line up handicapped models as well as aged models on the runway at StyleNite. The engagement of the handicapped model Mario Galla at the StyleNite in July 2010 was considered almost scandalous among the fashion scene and caused enormous media response.&lt;ref&gt;''Ich mag meinen Körper.'' Interview with Mario Galla. In: ''Der Stern.'' ([http://www.stern.de/lifestyle/mode/model-mario-galla-ich-mag-meinen-koerper-1586341.html/ online] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110917101015/http://www.stern.de/lifestyle/mode/model-mario-galla-ich-mag-meinen-koerper-1586341.html |date=17 September 2011 }}, accessed on 26 July 2010&lt;/ref&gt; In January 2011, the models Eveline Hall and [[Pat Cleveland]] walked the runway; both women are over 60 years old. The internationally renowned German model [[Toni Garrn]] has been a regular among the models at StyleNite for several years. In January 2013 [[Jimi Blue Ochsenknecht]] was proud to present his first run on catwalk for [[Michael Michalsky]].

== Tickets ==
There is no official ticket sale for the event. The invitations are sent exclusively to a limited number of guests. The audience at StyleNite changes each time, consisting of people from fashion, media, politics, art and celebrities.

The organizer provides selected media - mainly fashion magazines, blogs and design journals - with a limited number of tickets that are available for raffles.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.grazia-magazin.de/fashion/mode-gewinnspiele/Gewinnen-Sie-zwei-Tickets-zur-Michalsky-StyleNite-inkl-Anreise-und-Uebernachtung Grazia raffles tickets] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110125022822/http://www.grazia-magazin.de/fashion/mode-gewinnspiele/Gewinnen-Sie-zwei-Tickets-zur-Michalsky-StyleNite-inkl-Anreise-und-Uebernachtung |date=25 January 2011 }}, www.grazia-magazin.de, accessed on 8 September 2011&lt;/ref&gt; In single cases tickets are given to the students of Berlin's fashion design academies.

There is a strict door policy at the night of the StyleNite.

== Media coverage ==
The StyleNite is extensively covered in German and international media. In July 2011 the StyleNite was covered extensively by Chinese media for the first time. Vogue TV China broadcast a report&lt;ref&gt;[http://video.vogue.com.cn/voguevideo_show_v1.php?vid=680 Vogue TV China], www.video.vogue.com.cn, accessed on 5 September 2011&lt;/ref&gt; and the ''Cosmopolitan China'' dedicated an entire page to the event.

{{Tribes of Israel}}

The '''ten lost tribes''' were the ten of the [[Twelve Tribes of Israel]] that were said to have been deported from the [[Kingdom of Israel (Samaria)|Kingdom of Israel]] after its conquest by the [[Neo-Assyrian Empire]] circa 722 BCE.&lt;ref&gt;Josephus, ''The Antiquities of the Jews'', Book 11 chapter 1 and II Esdras 13:39–45&lt;/ref&gt; These are the tribes of [[Tribe of Reuben|Reuben]], [[Tribe of Simeon|Simeon]], [[Tribe of Dan|Dan]], [[Tribe of Naphtali|Naphtali]], [[Tribe of Gad|Gad]], [[Tribe of Asher|Asher]], [[Tribe of Issachar|Issachar]], [[Tribe of Zebulun|Zebulun]], [[Tribe of Manasseh|Manasseh]] and [[Tribe of Ephraim|Ephraim]]. Claims of descent from the "lost" tribes have been proposed in relation to many groups,&lt;ref name=WeilEJFT-ten&gt;{{cite book |last1=Weil|first1=Shalva|editor1-last=Patai |editor1-first=Raphael |editor2-last=Bar -Itzhak |editor2-first=Haya |title=Encyclopedia of Jewish Folklore and Traditions |date=2015 |publisher=Routledge |isbn=9781317471714 |chapter=Tribes, Ten Lost|volume=2|pages=542–543}}&lt;/ref&gt; and some religions espouse a [[Messianism|messianic]] view that the tribes will return.

In the 7th and 8th centuries CE, the return of the lost tribes was associated with the concept of the coming of the [[Messiah in Judaism|messiah]].&lt;ref name=Benite&gt;{{cite book |last1=Benite |first1=Zvi Ben-Dor |title=The Ten Lost Tribes: A World History |date=2009 |publisher=Oxford University Press, USA |isbn=9780195307337 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ujU-1tDZUPgC |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|58–62}}

The Jewish historian [[Josephus]] (37–100 CE) wrote that "the ten tribes are beyond the Euphrates till now, and are an immense multitude and not to be estimated in numbers".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Josephus|first1=Flavius|title=Antiquites|page=11:133}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Historian [[Tudor Parfitt]] has declared that "the Lost Tribes are indeed nothing but a myth", and he writes that "this myth is a vital feature of colonial discourse throughout the long period of European overseas empires, from the beginning of the fifteenth century, until the later half of the twentieth".&lt;ref name=Parfitt2003/&gt;{{rp|1, 225}}

==The twelve tribes==
{{See also|Assyrian captivity}}

The scriptural basis for the idea of "10 Lost Tribes" is 2 Kings 17:6: "In the ninth year of Hoshea, the king of [[Assyria]] captured Samaria and deported the Israelites to Assyria. He settled them in Halah, in Gozan on the Habor River and in the towns of the Medes." According to the [[Tanakh|Hebrew Bible]], [[Jacob]] (who was later named Israel; Genesis 35:10) had 12 sons and at least one daughter ([[Dinah]]) by two wives and two concubines. The twelve sons fathered the twelve [[Tribes of Israel]].
* When the land of Israel was apportioned among the tribes in the days of [[Joshua]], the [[Levite|Tribe of Levi]], being chosen as priests, did not receive land ({{bibleverse||Joshua|13:33|HE}}, {{bibleverse-nb||Joshua|14:3|HE}}). However, the tribe of Levi were given cities. Six cities were to be refuge cities for all men of Israel, which were to be controlled by the Levites. Three of these cities were located on each side of the Jordan River. In addition, 42 other cities (and their respective open spaces), totaling 48 cities, were given to the Tribe of Levi. ({{bibleverse||Numbers|35|HE}})
* Jacob elevated the descendants of [[Ephraim]] and [[Manasseh (tribal patriarch)|Manasseh]] (the two sons of Joseph by his Egyptian wife [[Asenath]]) ({{bibleverse||Genesis|41:50|HE}}) to the status of full tribes in their own right, replacing the [[Tribe of Joseph]] (Genesis 48:5). Each tribe received its own land and had its own encampment during the 40 years of wandering in the desert.

Thus, the two divisions of the tribes are:

According to the Bible, the [[Kingdom of Israel (Samaria)|Kingdom of Israel]] (or Northern Kingdom) was one of the successor states to the older [[United Monarchy]] (also called the Kingdom of Israel), which came into existence in about the 930s BCE after the northern [[Tribes of Israel]] rejected Solomon's son [[Rehoboam]] as their king. Nine landed tribes formed the Northern Kingdom: the tribes of [[Tribe of Reuben|Reuben]], [[Tribe of Issachar|Issachar]], [[Tribe of Zebulun|Zebulun]], [[Tribe of Dan|Dan]], [[Tribe of Naphtali|Naphtali]], [[Tribe of Gad|Gad]], [[Tribe of Asher|Asher]], [[Tribe of Ephraim|Ephraim]], and [[Tribe of Manasseh|Manasseh]]. In addition, some members of the Tribe of Levi, who had no land allocation, were found in the Northern Kingdom. The [[Tribe of Judah|Tribes of Judah]] and [[Tribe of Benjamin|Benjamin]] remained loyal to Rehoboam, and formed the [[Kingdom of Judah]] (or the Southern Kingdom). Members of Levi and the remnant of [[Tribe of Simeon|Simeon]] were also found in the Southern Kingdom.

According to {{bibleverse|2|Chronicles|15:9|HE}}, members of the tribes of [[Tribe of Ephraim|Ephraim]], [[Tribe of Manasseh|Manasseh]], and [[Tribe of Simeon|Simeon]] "fled" to Judah during the reign of [[Asa of Judah]] (c. 911–870 BCE). Whether these groups were absorbed into the population or remained distinct groups or returned to their tribal lands is not indicated.

In c. 732 BCE, the [[Assyrian people|Assyrian]] king [[Tiglath-Pileser III]] sacked [[Damascus]] and Israel, annexing [[Aramea]]&lt;ref name=Grabbe&gt;Lester L. Grabbe, ''Ancient Israel: What Do We Know and How Do We Know It?'' (New York: T&amp;T Clark, 2007): 134&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Transjordan (Bible)|territory]] of the tribes of [[Tribe of Reuben|Reuben]], [[Tribe of Gad|Gad]] and [[Tribe of Manasseh|Manasseh]] in [[Gilead]] including the desert outposts of [[Jetur]], [[Naphish]], and [[Nodab]]. People from these tribes, including the Reubenite leader, were taken captive and resettled in the region of the [[Khabur (Euphrates)|Khabur River]] system in Assyria/Mesopotamia. Tiglath-Pilesar also captured the territory of [[Tribe of Naphtali|Naphtali]] and the city of [[Janoah]] in [[Tribe of Ephraim|Ephraim]], and an Assyrian governor was placed over the region of [[Naphtali]]. According to {{Bibleverse|2|Kings|16:9|HE}} and {{Bibleverse-nb|2|Kings|15:29|HE}}, the population of Aram and the annexed part of Israel was deported to Assyria.

Israel continued to exist within the reduced territory as an independent kingdom subject to Assyria until around [[725 BCE|725]]–[[720 BCE]], when it was again invaded by Assyria and the rest of the population deported. The Bible relates that the population of Israel was exiled, leaving only the [[Tribe of Judah]], the [[Tribe of Simeon]] (that was "absorbed" into Judah), the [[Tribe of Benjamin]], and the people of the [[Tribe of Levi]] who lived among them of the original Israelite tribes in the southern Kingdom of Judah. However, [[Israel Finkelstein]] estimated that only a fifth of the population (about 40,000) were actually resettled out of the area during the two deportation periods under [[Tiglath-Pileser III]], [[Shalmaneser V]], and [[Sargon II]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Finkelstein |first1=Israel |last2=Silberman |first2=Neil Asher |title=The Bible unearthed : archaeology's new vision of ancient Israel and the origin of its sacred texts |date=2001 |publisher=Free Press |isbn=9780684869124}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{page needed|date=October 2018}} Many also fled south to Jerusalem, which appears to have expanded in size fivefold during this period, requiring a new wall to be built, and a new source of water ([[Siloam]]) to be provided by King [[Hezekiah]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Broshi |first=Maguen |title=Bread, Wine, Walls and Scrolls |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=etTUEorS1zMC&amp;pg=PA174&amp;dq=the+main+reasons+behind+this+expansion+was+the+immigration+of+Israelites+who+came+to+Judah+from+the+Northern+Kingdom+after+the+fall+of+Samaria+in+721+BCE&amp;hl=es-419&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=DCiQVbrTJsbv-AGv4oiICw&amp;ved=0CBkQ6AEwAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=the%20main%20reasons%20behind%20this%20expansion%20was%20the%20immigration%20of%20Israelites%20who%20came%20to%20Judah%20from%20the%20Northern%20Kingdom%20after%20the%20fall%20of%20Samaria%20in%20721%20BCE&amp;f=false |publisher=Bloomsbury Publishing |year=2001 |page=174 |isbn=1841272019}}&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, {{Bibleverse|2|Chronicles|30:1-11|HE}} explicitly mentions northern Israelites who had been spared by the Assyrians—in particular, members of Dan, Ephraim, Manasseh, Asher, and Zebulun—and how members of the latter three returned to worship at the Temple in Jerusalem at that time.

{{bibleref2|2 Kings|17:34}} says, "To this day they persist in their former practices. They neither worship Yahweh nor adhere to the decrees and regulations, the laws and commands that Yahweh gave the descendants of Jacob, whom he named Israel." The medieval rabbi and biblical commentator [[David Kimhi]] explains that this is in reference to the tribes that were exiled, and that they remained in their ways, neither accepting a monotheistic God nor in adhering to any of the laws and regulations that were common to all Jews.&lt;ref&gt;David Kimhi. Commentary on 2 Kings 17:34&lt;/ref&gt;

The Hebrew Bible does not use the phrase "ten lost tribes", leading some to question the number of tribes involved. {{bibleref2|1 Kings|11:31|HE}} states that the kingdom would be taken from [[Solomon]] and ten tribes given to [[Jeroboam]]:
{{quote|And he said to Jeroboam, Take thee ten pieces: for thus saith the LORD, the God of Israel, Behold, I will rend the kingdom out of the hand of Solomon, and will give ten tribes to thee.

...

But I will take the kingdom out of his son's hand, and will give it unto thee, even ten tribes.|{{bibleverse|1|Kings|11:31,35|HE}}}}

===Biblical apocrypha===
According to Zvi Ben-Dor Benite:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Centuries after their disappearance, the ten lost tribes sent an indirect but vital sign ... In [[2 Esdras]], we read about the ten tribes and "their long journey through that region, which is called Arzareth" ... The book of the "Vision of Ezra", or Esdras, was written in [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]] or [[Aramaic language|Aramaic]] by a Palestinian Jew sometime before the end of the first century CE, shortly after the destruction of the temple by the Romans. It is one of a group of texts later designated as the so-called [[Apocrypha]]—pseudoepigraphal books attached to but not included in the Hebrew biblical canon.&lt;ref name=Benite/&gt;{{rp|57}}&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===New Testament===
Some evidence exists of a continuing identification in later centuries of individual Israelites to the Lost Tribes. For example, in {{bible verse||Luke|2:36|NIV}} of the New Testament, an individual is identified with the [[tribe of Asher]].

==Religious beliefs==

===Judaism===
There are discussions in the [[Talmud]] as to whether the ten lost tribes will eventually be reunited with the [[Tribe of Judah]]; that is, with the Jewish people.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Neubauer |first1=A. |title=Where Are the Ten Tribes?: I. Bible, Talmud, and Midrashic Literature |journal=The Jewish Quarterly Review |date=1888 |volume=1 |issue=1 |pages=14–28 |doi=10.2307/1449853 |jstor=1449853}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the Talmud, the Sanhedrin equate the exile of the lost tribes with being morally and spiritually lost. In [[Sanhedrin (tractate)|Tractate Sanhedrin]] 110B, Rabbi Eliezer states:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Just like a day is followed by darkness, and the light later returns, so too, although it will become 'dark'. for the ten tribes, G‑d will ultimately take them out of their darkness.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
In the Jerusalem Talmud,&lt;ref&gt;[[Sanhedrin (tractate)|Sanhedrin]] 10:5&lt;/ref&gt; Rabbi Shimon ben Yehudah, of the town of Acco, states in the name of Rabbi Shimon:

&lt;blockquote&gt;If their deeds are as this day's, they will not return; otherwise they shall.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Christianity===
The increased currency of tales relating to lost tribes that occurred in the 17th century was due to the confluence of several factors. According to Parfitt:&lt;blockquote&gt;As Michael Pollack shows, Menasseh's argument was based on "three separate and seemingly unrelated sources: a verse from the book of Isaiah, Matteo Ricci's discovery of an old Jewish community in the heart of China and Antonio Montezinos' reported encounter with members of the Lost Tribes in the wilds of South America".&lt;ref name=Parfitt2003/&gt;{{rp|69}}&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In 1649 Menasseh published his book, ''The Hope of Israel'', in Spanish and in Latin in Amsterdam; it included Montezinos' account of the Lost Tribes in the New World.&lt;ref name="henry"/&gt;&lt;ref name="wilensky"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Wilensky |first1=M. |title=The Royalist Position concerning the Readmission of Jews to England |journal=The Jewish Quarterly Review |date=1951 |volume=41 |issue=4 |pages=397–409 |doi=10.2307/1453207 |jstor=1453207}}&lt;/ref&gt; An English translation was published in London in 1650. In it Menasseh argued, and for the first time tried to give learned support in European thought and printing, to the theory that the [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|native inhabitants of America]] at the time of the European discovery were actually descendants of the [lost] Ten Tribes of Israel.&lt;ref name="henry"&gt;Méchoulan, Henry, and Nahon, Gérard (eds.), ''Menasseh Ben Israel. The Hope of Israel'', Oxford University Press, Oxford, 1987, {{ISBN|0-19-710054-6}}, p. 101 and ''passim''.&lt;/ref&gt; Menasseh noted how important Montezinos' account was, 
{{quote|for the Scriptures do not tell what people first inhabited those Countries; neither was there mention of them by any, til ''[[Christopher Columbus|Christop. Columbus]], [[Amerigo Vespucci|Americus, Vespacius]] [sic], [[Hernán Cortés|Ferdinandus, Cortez]] [sic], the [[Marquisate of the Valley of Oaxaca|Marquesse Del Valle]] [sic]'', and ''[[Francisco Pizarro|Franciscus Pizarrus]] [sic]'' went thither&amp;nbsp;...&lt;ref name="hope"&gt;Menasseh ben Israel, ''[http://olivercowdery.com/texts/1650hope.htm#pg10a The Hope of Israel]'' (London, 1650, English translation), scanned text online at Oliver's Bookshelf, accessed 10 May 2013&lt;/ref&gt;}}

He wrote on 23 December 1649: "I think that the Ten Tribes live not only there ... but also in other lands scattered everywhere; these never did come back to the [[Second Temple]] and they keep till this day still the Jewish Religion&amp;nbsp;..."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Ausubel |first1=Nathan |title=Pictorial history of the Jewish people ; from Bible times to our own day throughout the world |date=1953 |publisher=Crown |isbn=9780517552834 |edition=1st rev.|url=https://archive.org/details/pictorialhistory00ausu}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|118}}

In 1655, Menasseh ben Israel petitioned [[Oliver Cromwell]] to allow the [[History of the Jews in England|Jews to return to England]] in furtherance of the Messianic goal. (Since the [[Edict of Expulsion]] in 1290, Jews had been prohibited by law from living in [[England]].) With the approach of 1666, considered a significant date, Cromwell was allegedly interested in the return of the Jews to England because of the many theories circulating related to millennial thinking about the [[End Time|end of the world]]. Many of these ideas were fixed upon the year 1666 and the [[Fifth Monarchy Men]] who were looking for the return of [[Jesus]] as the [[Messiah]]; he was expected to establish a final kingdom to rule the physical world for a thousand years. Messianic believers supported Cromwell's Republic in the expectation that it was a preparation for the ''[[fifth monarchy]]''—that is, the monarchy that should succeed the [[Babylonia]]n, [[Persian Empire|Persian]], [[Ancient Greece|Greek]], and [[Ancient Rome|Roman]] world empires.{{Citation needed|date=May 2011}}

Apocryphal accounts concerning the Lost Tribes, based to varying degrees on biblical accounts, have been produced by both [[Jew]]s and [[Christianity|Christians]] since at least the 17th century.&lt;ref name=Benite/&gt;{{rp|59}} An [[Ashkenazi]] Jewish tradition speaks of these tribes as ''Die Roite Yiddelech'', "the little [[red Jews]]", cut off from the rest of Jewry by the legendary river [[Sambation]], "whose foaming waters raise high up into the sky a wall of fire and smoke that is impossible to pass through".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Rosen |first1=Moses |editor1-last=Riff |editor1-first=Michael |title=The face of survival : Jewish life in Eastern Europe past and present |date=1992 |publisher=Valentine Mitchell |location=London |isbn=9780853032298 |url=https://archive.org/details/faceofsurvival00mich |chapter=Epilogue: The Recipe|oclc=28236867|page=215}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Historians generally concluded that the groups referred to as the Lost Tribes merged with the local population. For instance, the ''New Standard Jewish Encyclopedia'' states: "In historic fact, some members of the Ten Tribes remained in Palestine, where apart from the Samaritans some of their descendants long preserved their identity among the Jewish population, others were assimilated, while others were presumably absorbed by the last Judean exiles who in 597–586 BC were deported to Assyria&amp;nbsp;... Unlike the Judeans of the southern Kingdom, who survived a similar fate 135 years later, they soon assimilated&amp;nbsp;..."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Lyman |first1=Stanford M. |title=The Lost Tribes of Israel as a Problem in History and Sociology |journal=International Journal of Politics, Culture, and Society |date=1998 |volume=12 |issue=1 |pages=7–42 |jstor=20019954}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Latter Day Saint movement====
{{Main|House of Joseph (LDS Church)}}
The [[Book of Mormon]] is based on the premise that two families of Israelites escaped from Israel shortly before the sacking of Jerusalem by Nebuchadnezzar and that they constructed a boat, crossed the Atlantic Ocean, and arrived in the New World as founders of Native American tribes and eventually the Polynesians.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Johnson |first1=Lane |title=Who and Where Are the Lamanites?|url=https://www.lds.org/ensign/1975/12/who-and-where-are-the-lamanites?lang=eng |publisher=Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints |accessdate=18 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Adherents believe the two founding tribes were called [[Nephites]] and [[Lamanites]], that the Nephites were white and practiced Christianity, and that the Lamanites were rebellious and received dark skin from God as a mark to separate the two tribes. Eventually the Lamanites wiped out the [[Nephites]] around 400 AD, leaving only dark skinned Native Americans. The descent of Native Americans from Israel is a key part of Mormonism's foundational beliefs. For example, Native American followers are almost always declared to be of the house of Manasseh when receiving Patriarchal Blessings, which purport to reveal ethnic lineage.&lt;ref&gt;"[https://bycommonconsent.com/2015/07/29/patriarchal-blessing-lineages/ Patriarchal Blessing Lineages]". ''By Common Consent''&lt;/ref&gt;

[[The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints]] (LDS Church) believes in the [[Second Coming (LDS Church)#Gathering of Judah|literal gathering of Israel]], and the LDS Church actively preaches the gathering of people from the twelve tribes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Nelson|first=Russell M.|title=The Gathering of Scattered Israel|journal=[[Liahona (magazine)|Liahona]]|date=November 2006|url=http://www.lds.org/liahona/2006/11/the-gathering-of-scattered-israel|accessdate=23 April 2013|authorlink=Russell M. Nelson|publisher=[[The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; "Today Israelites are found in all countries of the world. Many of these people do not know that they are descended from the ancient house of Israel," the church teaches in its basic ''[[Gospel Principles]]'' manual. "The Lord promised that His covenant people would someday be gathered .... God gathers His children through missionary work. As people come to a knowledge of Jesus Christ, receiving the ordinances of salvation and keeping the associated covenants, they become 'the children of the covenant' ([[Third Nephi|3 Nephi]] 20:26)."

The church also teaches that "The power and authority to direct the work of gathering the house of Israel was given to [[Joseph Smith]] by the prophet Moses, who appeared in 1836 in the Kirtland Temple.... The Israelites are to be gathered spiritually first and then physically. They are gathered spiritually as they join The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints and make and keep sacred covenants.... The physical gathering of Israel means that the covenant people will be “gathered home to the lands of their inheritance, and shall be established in all their lands of promise” (2 Nephi 9:2). The tribes of Ephraim and Manasseh will be gathered in the Americas. The tribe of Judah will return to the city of Jerusalem and the area surrounding it. The ten lost tribes will receive from the tribe of Ephraim their promised blessings (see D&amp;C 133:26–34). . . The physical gathering of Israel will not be complete until the Second Coming of the Savior and on into the Millennium (see Joseph Smith—Matthew 1:37)."&lt;ref&gt;''[[Gospel Principles]]'', chapter 42, [http://www.lds.org/manual/gospel-principles/chapter-42-the-gathering-of-the-house-of-israel "The Gathering of the House of Israel"].&lt;/ref&gt;

One of their main [[Articles of Faith (Latter Day Saints)|Articles of Faith]], written by Joseph Smith, is as follows:  "We believe in the literal gathering of Israel and in the restoration of the Ten Tribes; that Zion (the New Jerusalem) will be built upon the American continent; that Christ will reign personally upon the earth; and, that the earth will be renewed and receive its paradisiacal glory."  (LDS Articles of Faith #10)

Regarding the Ezekiel 37 prophecy, the church teaches that the ''[[Book of Mormon]]'' is the stick of Ephraim (or Joseph) mentioned and that the [[Bible]] is the stick of Judah, thus comprising two witnesses for Jesus Christ. The church believes the ''Book of Mormon'' to be a collection of records by prophets of the ancient Americas, written on plates of gold and translated by Joseph Smith c. 1830. The church considers the ''Book of Mormon'' one of the main tools for the spiritual gathering of Israel.

==Ethnology and anthropology==
Expanded exploration and study of groups throughout the world through archeology and the new field of anthropology in the late 19th century led to a revival or reworking of accounts of the Lost Tribes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Weil |first1=Shalva |editor1-last=Baskin |editor1-first=Judith R. |title=The Cambridge dictionary of Judaism and Jewish culture |date=2013 |publisher=Cambridge University Press |isbn=9780511982491 |page=616 |chapter=Ten Lost Tribes}}&lt;/ref&gt; For instance, because archeological finds of the Mississippian culture's complex earthwork mounds seemed beyond the skills of the Native American cultures known to European Americans at the time of their discovery, it was theorized that the ancient civilizations involved in the mounds' construction were linked to the Lost Tribes. They tried to fit new information into a biblical construct.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Conn |first1=Steven |title=History's shadow : Native Americans and historical consciousness in the nineteenth century |date=2004 |publisher=University of Chicago Press |isbn=978-0226114941 |page=123}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the earthworks across North America have been conclusively linked to various Native groups, and most archaeologists now consider the theory of non-Native origin to be pseudo-science.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Neusius |first1=Sarah W. |last2=Gross |first2=G.

The [[Igbo Jews]] of [[Nigeria]] claim descent variously from the tribes of [[Tribe of Ephraim|Ephraim]], [[Tribe of Naphtali|Naphtali]], [[Tribe of Menasseh|Menasseh]], [[Tribe of Levi|Levi]], [[Tribe of Zebulun|Zebulun]] and [[Tribe of Gad|Gad]]. 
The theory, however, does not hold up to historical scrutiny. Historians have examined the historical literature on [[West Africa]] from the colonial era and they have elucidated diverse functions that such theories served for the writers who proposed them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Sanders |first=Edith |year= 1963 |title= The Hamitic Hypothesis: Its Origin and Functions in Time Perspective |journal= Journal of African History |volume= 10 |issue= 4 |pages= 521–532 |jstor=179896}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Zachernuk |first=Philip |year=1994 |title= Of Origins and Colonial Order: Southern Nigerians and the 'Hamitic Hypothesis' c. 1870-1970 |journal= Journal of African History |volume= 35 |issue= 3 |pages= 427–55 |jstor=182643 |doi=10.1017/s0021853700026785}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Pakhtun/Pashtun of Afghanistan and Pakistan===
{{Main|Theory of Pashtun descent from Israelites}}
The [[Pashtuns]] are a predominantly [[Muslim]] [[Iranian peoples|Iranic]] people, native to Afghanistan and Pakistan, who adhere to a pre-Islamic indigenous religious code of honor and culture, [[Pashtunwali]]. The myth about Pashtuns being from the lost tribes of Israel has never been substantiated through concrete historical evidence.&lt;ref name="LoC"&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://lcweb2.loc.gov/cgi-bin/query/r?frd/cstdy:@field(DOCID+af0037) |title=Afhganistan Ethnic Groups |work=|publisher=[[Library of Congress Country Studies]]|year=1997|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130726012707/http://lcweb2.loc.gov/cgi-bin/query/r?frd/cstdy:@field(DOCID+af0037)|archivedate=July 26, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="CAL-Pashtuns"&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.cal.org/co/afghan/apeop.html |title=The People - The Pashtuns|work=|publisher=[[Center for Applied Linguistics]] (CAL)|date=June 30, 2002|accessdate=2010-10-29|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070105112924/http://www.cal.org/co/afghan/apeop.html|archivedate=2007-01-05 |deadurl=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many members of the [[Taliban]] hail from the Pashtun tribes and they do not necessarily disclaim their alleged "Israelite" descent.&lt;ref name=WeillEJD-pathans/&gt;&lt;ref name=Weiltaliban&gt;{{cite news |last1=Weil |first1=Shalva |title=The Israelite Connections of the Taliban |url=http://www.css.ethz.ch/en/services/digital-library/articles/article.html/132724/pdf |work=ETH Zurich Center for Security Studies |date=September 7, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The tribal name '[[Yusufzai|Yusef Zai]]' in Pashto translates as the "sons of Joseph"&lt;ref name=Weiltaliban/&gt;

A number of genetic studies refute the possibility of a connection, whereas others maintain a link.&lt;ref name=Entine/&gt;{{rp|117}}

In 2010, ''[[The Guardian]]'' reported that the Israeli government was planning to fund a genetic study in order to test the veracity of a genetic link between the Pashtuns and the lost tribes of Israel. The article stated "Historical and anecdotal evidence strongly suggests a connection, but definitive scientific proof has never been found. Some leading Israeli anthropologists believe that, of all the many groups in the world who claim a connection to the 10 lost tribes, the Pashtuns, or Pathans, have the most compelling case."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=McCarthy |first1=Rory |title=Pashtun clue to lost tribes of Israel |url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2010/jan/17/israel-lost-tribes-pashtun |work=the Guardian |date=17 January 2010 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Sefwi Tribe in Ghana===
The Sefwi tribe in Ghana had a history of some Judaic practices, including observing the [[Shabbat|Sabbath]], circumcision at eight days ([[brit milah]]), a rite of manhood at 13 years, observing laws of family purity ([[Niddah|taharat mishpacha or niddah]]). In 1977 a member of the tribe, Aaron Ahotre Toakyirafa had a vision that he was Jewish and part of a lost tribe of Israel. Some scholars believe the Jewish customs likely represent Jews who were part of the expulsion from Spain in 1492 who migrated south from Morocco. The community became known as the "[[House of Israel (Ghana)|House of Israel]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Lidman |first1=Melanie |title=Ghana’s deep spirituality points some, joyfully, back to Judaism |url=https://www.timesofisrael.com/ghanas-deep-spirituality-points-some-joyfully-back-to-judaism/ |work=Times of Isreal |date=April 14, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Jehu-Obelisk-cropped.jpg|thumb|300px|A depiction of either [[Jehu|King Jehu]], or Jehu's ambassador, kneeling at the feet of [[Shalmaneser III]] on the [[Black Obelisk]].]]
Adherents of [[British Israelism]] and their heirs, the [[Christian Identity]] movement, believe that the lost tribes migrated northward, over the Caucuses, and became  the [[Scythians]], [[Cimmerians]] and [[Goths]], and progenitors of the later invaders of Britain.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Chryssides|first=George D.|title=Historical Dictionary of New Religious Movements|publisher=The Scarecros Press, Inc.|location=Lanham|year=2012|page=65|isbn=9780810861947}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Quarles&gt;{{cite book | last = Quarles | first = Chester L | title = Christian Identity: The Aryan American Bloodline Religion | publisher = McFarland &amp; co | year = 2004 | url = https://books.google.com/?id=r5BzY2eeyngC | isbn = 978-0-78641892-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|26–27}}

The theory arose in England, whence it spread to the United States.&lt;ref name=Parfitt2003&gt;{{cite book |last1=Parfitt |first1=Tudor |title=The lost tribes of Israel : the history of a myth |date=2003 |publisher=Weidenfeld &amp; Nicolson |isbn=978-0297819349}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|52–65}} During the 20th century, British Israelism was promoted by [[Herbert W. Armstrong]], founder of the [[Grace Communion International|Worldwide Church of God]].&lt;ref name=Parfitt2003/&gt;{{rp|57}}

[[Tudor Parfitt]], author of ''The Lost Tribes: The History of a Myth'', states that the proof cited by adherents of British Israelism is "of a feeble composition even by the low standards of the genre",&lt;ref name=Parfitt2003/&gt;{{rp|61}} and these notions are widely rejected by historians.&lt;ref name=Spittler&gt;{{cite book|last=Spittler|first=Russell P.|title=Cults and isms: twenty alternatives to evangelical Christianity|publisher=Baker Book House Company|location=Grand Rapids, MI|year=1963|page=101}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Native Americans===
{{see also|Northern Cherokee Nation of the Old Louisiana Territory#The "Lost Tribe"}}
In 1650, a British minister named Thomas Thorowgood, who was a preacher in Norfolk, published a book entitled ''Jewes in America or Probabilities that the Americans are of that Race'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Thorowgood |first1=Thomas |title=Ievves in America, or, Probabilities that the Americans are of that race.

Parfitt writes of this work: "The society was active in trying to convert the Indians but suspected that they might be Jews and realized they better be prepared for an arduous task. Thorowgood's tract argued that the native population of North America were descendants of the Ten Lost Tribes."&lt;ref name=Parfitt2003/&gt;{{rp|66}}&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In 1652 [[Hamon L'Estrange|Sir Hamon L'Estrange]], an English author writing on topics such as history and theology published an exegetical tract called ''Americans no Jews, or improbabilities that the Americans are of that Race'' in response to the tract by Thorowgood. In response to L'Estrange, Thorowgood published a second edition of his book in 1660 with a revised title and included a foreword written by [[John Eliot (missionary)|John Eliot]], a [[Puritan]] missionary to the Indians who had translated the Bible into an Indian language.&lt;ref name=Parfitt2003/&gt;{{rp|66, 76}}

===Japanese===
{{Main|Japanese-Jewish common ancestry theory}}
Some writers have speculated that the [[Japanese people]]  may be the direct descendants of some of the Ten Lost Tribes. Parfitt writes that "the spread of the fantasy of Israelite origin ... forms a consistent feature of the Western colonial enterprise....It is in fact in Japan that we can trace the most remarkable evolution in the Pacific of an imagined Judaic past. As elsewhere in the world, the theory that aspects of the country were to be explained via an Israelite model was introduced by Western agents.&lt;ref name=Parfitt2003/&gt;{{rp|158}}

In 1878, Scottish immigrant to Japan [[Nicholas McLeod]] self-published ''Epitome of the Ancient History of Japan''.&lt;ref name=Mcleod&gt;{{cite book |last=McLeod |first=N. |title=Epitome of the Ancient History of Japan |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=U2c_AAAAYAAJ |series=Western books on Asia., Unit 12 |year=1878 |publisher=auther {{sic}} at the Rising Sun Office |location=Nagasaki |oclc=35725085}}&lt;/ref&gt;

McLeod drew correlations between his observations of Japan and the fulfillment of biblical prophecy: The civilized race of the [[Ainu people|Aa. Inus]],&lt;sup&gt;&amp;#91;[[sic]]: read ''Ainus'']&lt;/sup&gt; the [[Tokugawa shogunate|Tokugawa]] and the Machi No Hito of the large towns, by dwelling in the tent or tabernacle shaped houses first erected by [[Emperor Jimmu|Jin Mu Tenno]], have fulfilled [[Noah]]'s prophecy regarding [[Japheth|Japhet]], "He shall dwell in the tents of [[Shem]]."&lt;ref name=Mcleod/&gt;{{rp|7}}

[[Jon Entine]] emphasizes that DNA evidence shows that there are no genetic links between Japanese and Israelite people.&lt;ref name=Entine/&gt;{{rp|117}}

===Lemba===
{{Main|Lemba people}}
The [[Lemba people]] (Vhalemba) from [[Southern Africa]] claim to be the descendants of several Jewish men who traveled from what is now [[Yemen]] to [[Africa]] in search of gold, where they took wives and established new communities.&lt;ref&gt;[http://transcripts.cnn.com/TRANSCRIPTS/0409/11/i_if.00.html Transcript, INSIDE AFRICA: Current Events on the African Continent], CNN, 11 September 2004.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Lost Tribes of Israel: The Lemba |url=https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/nova/israel/familylemba.html |publisher=PBS NOVA |date=November 2000}}&lt;/ref&gt;  They have specific religious practices similar to those in Judaism and a tradition of being a migrant people, with clues pointing to an origin in [[West Asia]] or [[North Africa]]. According to the oral history of the Lemba, their ancestors were Jews who came from a place called [[Sena, Yemen|Sena]] several hundred years ago and settled in [[East Africa]]. Sena is an abandoned ancient town in Yemen, located in the eastern Hadramaut valley, which history indicates Jews inhabited in past centuries. Some research suggests that "Sena" may refer to [[Wadi Masilah]] (near [[Sayhut]]) in Yemen, often called Sena, or alternatively to the city of [[Sana'a]], also located in Yemen.&lt;ref name=ParfittNOVA&gt;{{cite web |title=Lost Tribes of Israel: Tudor Parfitt's Remarkable Journey |url=https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/nova/israel/parfitt2.html |publisher=PBS NOVA |date=November 2000}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Parfitt2003/&gt;{{rp|61}}

Moreover, Taiwan was experiencing significant effects from the [[1973 oil crisis]]. Therefore, to upgrade the industry and the development of the country, the government planned to take on ten massive building projects. They were proposed by the [[Premier of the Republic of China|Premier]] [[Chiang Ching-kuo]], beginning in 1974, with a planned completion by 1979. There were six transportation projects, three industrial projects, and one power-plant construction project, which ultimately cost over [[New Taiwan dollar|NT$]]300 billion in total.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.moeasmea.gov.tw/ct.asp?xItem=72&amp;CtNode=263&amp;mp=2&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Fountain in Cleethorpes.JPG|right|thumb|Statue in [[Cleethorpes]], England]]
'''''The Boy with the Leaking Boot''''' is a statue showing a young boy, with a bare right foot, holding up his right boot and looking at it.  The statue is about {{convert|4|ft}} tall, and in many cases forms a fountain, with water emerging from the toe of the boot. There are at least 24,&lt;ref name=roadside&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.roadsideamerica.com/set/boot.html|title=The boy and the Boot|work=RoadsideAmerica.com|accessdate=9 July 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; and reportedly "hundreds"&lt;ref name="shawangunk"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gunkguide.com/09Nov/09034-boot.html|title=That Mysterious Boy with the Boot|last=Rubin|first=Brian|date=November 2009|work=Shawangunk Mountain Guide|accessdate=6 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; of examples.  The origins of the statue are obscure.  The boy is reported to be a young Italian newspaper seller who drowned, or an American army drummer-boy who carried water in his leaking boot to help fallen comrades,&lt;ref name=piebirds&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.piebirds.co.uk/Leaking%20Boot.htm|title=Leaking Boot|accessdate=9 July 2009|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080512065919/http://www.piebirds.co.uk/Leaking%20Boot.htm|archivedate=12 May 2008|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; or a young fire-fighter either using his boot in a [[Bucket brigade|bucket chain]] or emptying his boot after an incident,&lt;ref name=shawangunk /&gt; or possibly none of these.   The statue has also been called '''''The Boy with the Leaky Boot''''',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Carney|first1=Jim|title=Boy with the Leaky Boot to return to Wadsworth for city’s bicentennial|url=http://www.ohio.com/news/local/boy-with-the-leaky-boot-to-return-to-wadsworth-for-city-s-bicentennial-1.467088|publisher=ohio.com|accessdate=13 August 2015|date=16 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; '''''Boy Immigrant''''' and '''''Unfortunate Boot'''''.&lt;ref name=ellenville /&gt;

==Origins==
[[File:Grabado del Niño de la bota.jpg|thumb|Original historic print on the J. L. Mott Iron Works 1925's fountain's Catalog used by Santa Clara council (Cuba) when they selected the fountain for the city's main square.]]

The exact origin of the "Boy with the Boot" statue/fountains has been uncertain.  It appears the first statues appeared in the U.S. c.1895 and were thought to have been purchased in Europe by wealthy travelers on the "Grand European Tour".  Many stories relate the statues came from Germany, but that has not been confirmed.{{citation needed|date=May 2015}}

However, a connection between the statue and Germany may have more validity. Patrick Patterson of Clovis, California purchased what was purported to be the "original" bronze molds for the Boy with the Boot statue in 1998 from an antique dealer (Lamoine Abbott) of San Angelo, Texas.  These molds of the Boy with the Boot statue were sold to the Texas dealer by "Midwest Exchange, Inc." of Shawnee, Wisconsin in 1981.  Midwest Exchange Inc. related the molds came from a Mr. Henry Braun, of Cincinnati, Ohio.  Mr. Braun was believed to have emigrated from Germany in the 1920s and may have brought these molds with him.  It was stated Henry Braun was an "uncle" of Eva Braun.{{citation needed|date=May 2015}}

The bronze molds are probably the "original" molds because the "original" statues were cast in "white metal" (zinc) by a process of "slurry casting"...a process quite different from lost wax casting methods.{{citation needed|date=May 2015}}

== Statues in the United States==

Among the earliest statues is that in [[Sandusky, Ohio]], where it stood in front of the Porter House hotel on the shore of [[Lake Erie]]. The original zinc statue was brought from Germany in 1876 by a prominent local couple, Mr and Mrs Voltaire Scott.  After cyclone damage and several incidences of vandalism, the statue was moved to the lobby of the local City Hall, and a replacement bronze was installed in a fountain in Washington Park.&lt;ref name="roadside"/&gt;

In [[Helena, Montana]], a statue stood in front of the "Natatorium", built in 1889 and housing the then-largest indoor plunge pool in the world, as part of the Broadwater Hotel complex. The statue is now in the former First National Bank Building on Last Chance Gulch in the town.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lifelikecharm.com/Broadwater_today.htm|title=The Broadwater today|work=The Hotel Broadwater and natatorium|accessdate=15 July 2009}} – includes images c.1890 and recent&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lifelikecharm.com/Broadwater_natatorium.htm|title=The Natatorium|work=The Broadwater Hotel and natatorium|accessdate=15 July 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One of the statues was erected in Courthouse Park in [[Fresno, California]] in 1895. It was a drinking fountain, funded by public subscription organised by Sergeant Nichols of the [[Salvation Army]].  Tin cups hung from the statue, and the pipes were cooled by blocks of ice. The statue was purchased from the [[J. L. Mott Iron Works]] of New York. The statue was moved, vandalised and repaired on various occasions, recast in bronze in 1947, and again recast in 1995. It is currently in the Fresno County Plaza on Tulare Street.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Rehart|first=Catherine Morison|title=The Valley's Legends &amp; Legacies|publisher=Quill Driver Books|year=1996|pages=28|chapter=The Boy with the Leaking Boot|isbn=978-1-884995-12-5|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=cCpk_P3d-h0C&amp;dq=boy+with+leaking+boot&amp;source=gbs_navlinks_s}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The statue erected in 1895 in [[Stevens Point, Wisconsin]], had a similarly chequered existence, being damaged by a [[horse-drawn vehicle]] in 1910 and thereafter cared for by the local fire department, outside whose station he stood with various incidents of damage and restoration including being decapitated in 1998 (the head was handed in to the police three days later).  A concrete casting of the statue was made and erected in 2009. The original statue, restored, was in 2010 still in the possession of the fire department and it was reported that "An idea which seems to be gathering support is to install him in a glass case inside Fire Station #1."&lt;ref name="stevens"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ci.stevens-point.wi.us/fire/boy_w_boot.html|title=Fire Department Boy with the Boot Statue|work=City of Stevens Point:, Wisconsin|accessdate=26 August 2010 | date=15 March 2010 | last=Menzel | first=Dan}}&lt;/ref&gt;
A statue of the boy highlights a fountain on Main Street and School Street in [[Wallingford, Vermont]], United States, and has been a centerpiece in the town since 1898.&lt;ref name="roadside"/&gt;

There have been five statues in five different locations in [[New Orleans]] since 1898 when the first was erected at the Milliken Children's Hospital of Charity. The boot, all that remained after this statue was vandalised in 1961, is reported to grace the present [[day hospital]] administrator's desk.  The latest statue stands in a pool at the Children's Hospital.&lt;ref name="stall"&gt;{{cite book|last=Stall|first=Buddy|title=Buddy Stall's New Orleans|year=1990|publisher=Pelican Publishing|pages=145–147|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=b0_gRpiHCXQC&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;vq=145&amp;dq=boy%20boot%20statue&amp;pg=PA145#v=onepage&amp;q=unfortunate%20boot&amp;f=false|chapter=Statuary: Unfortunate Boot |first2=Gaspar |last2=Stall|accessdate=24 August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The village of [[Ellenville, New York|Ellenville]] claims to have three of these statues: a 1997 model in the village's Liberty Square, a statue purchased in 1925 now in the Public Library, and one presumed to date from before 1908 and currently awaiting restoration.  This last statue was made by [[J. L. Mott Iron Works]] and was erected on the lawn of the house then occupied by Henry Brodhead, who was paymaster for the Mott Iron Works until the company moved from New York to [[Trenton, New Jersey]] in 1908.  It was used by sculptor Matt Pozorski when creating the 1997 version.&lt;ref name=ellenville&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wawarsing.net/01/COPDF/18-19-Boyboot.pdf|title=The Boy with the Boot|last=Dumond|first=Marion M.|date=December 2002|work=Wawarsing.net|pages=18–19|accessdate=15 July 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; The statue is described as "an important icon of Ellenville".&lt;ref name=shawangunk /&gt;

A statue was erected at High Point Mansion, [[Hershey, Pennsylvania]], then the home of [[Milton S.

It is now in the [[Hershey Gardens]]. As Mrs Hershey died in 1915 this statue must be from that year or earlier.&lt;ref name="highpoint"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hersheyarchives.org/essay/details.aspx?EssayId=19&amp;Rurl=%2fresources%2fsearch-results.aspx%3fType%3dBrowseEssay|title=Highpoint Mansion|work=Hershey Community Archive|accessdate=9 July 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Penrose, Colorado]], a bronze statue was erected in 1915, presented to the town by Spencer and Julie Penrose.  After the common tale of kidnappings and damage, it was presented to Penrose School in 2005 and is kept there in a display case. It is the property of the Senior Citizens of Penrose.&lt;ref name="Penrose"&gt;{{cite web|title=The Boy With the Boot|url=http://www.penrosechamber.com/LocalInformation/History/TheBoywiththeBoot.aspx|work=Penrose Chamber of Commerce|accessdate=24 August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A well maintained statue with eight working drinking fountains can be seen in [[Houlton, Maine]], in Pierce Park.  It was purchased in 1916 after Mrs Clara P. Frisbie left the city $1000 to beautify the park.&lt;ref name="Houlton"&gt;{{cite web|last=Clark|first=Michael|title=Houlton's "Boy and the Boot" statue|url=http://www.geocaching.com/seek/cache_details.aspx?guid=8ab58e81-5fa6-4f09-940d-0d89860688f4|work=Geocaching: Boy and the Boot (Rotary 1)}} (Substantial history of the statue provided as background on geocaching site)&lt;/ref&gt;  The statue is featured in the flash introduction of the city website home page.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.houlton-maine.com/|title=home page|work=Houlton Maine|accessdate=23 August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A statue stood in City Hall Park in [[El Paso, Texas]] for 50 years before being moved to [[San Jacinto Plaza]], in the 1950s.  There it was protected by a moat containing alligators.  In 1995 it was in El Paso City Hall.&lt;ref name="elpaso"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Gavilanes|first=Elizabeth|title=San Jacinto Plaza Remains Heart of Downtown El Paso|journal=Borderlands|year=1995|volume=13|url=http://dnn.epcc.edu/nwlibrary/borderlands/13_San_Jacinto_Plaza.htm|accessdate=26 August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A statue was acquired by Baker County, Oregon about 1908 when the county courthouse was built. The "boy" was the center of the fountain in front of the courthouse where he stood with his leaking boot as four lion heads spewed water toward him from the four corners of the fountain. After several repairs due to vandalism he was brought inside the courthouse and finally encased 9 June 1975.

Further statues have been reported to exist in the United States at [[Salida, Colorado]] (at the [[Heart of the Rockies Regional Medical Center]]), and [[Council Bluffs, Iowa]]

==Statues in Canada==
A statue in [[Assiniboine Park]], Winnipeg, [[Manitoba]], was originally donated to the city by the Young Peoples' Christian Endeavour Society and the Trades and Labour Council in honour of [[Queen Victoria]]'s golden jubilee in 1897.   It formed part of a fountain outside the old city hall, and was moved to the park in 1953 with funding from [[Rotary International|Order of Rotary International Fellowship]].&lt;ref name=piebirds /&gt;&lt;ref name="wylie"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Wylie|first1=Betty Jane|title=The Boy with the Boot|journal=Manitoba Pageant|date=January 1959|volume=4|issue=2|url=http://www.mhs.mb.ca/docs/pageant/04/boywithboot.shtml|accessdate=17 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Toy Story''''' is a [[Computer-generated imagery|computer animated]] [[film series]] and [[Disney]] [[media franchise]] that began with the [[Toy Story|1995 film of the same name]], produced by [[Pixar|Pixar Animation Studios]] and released by [[Walt Disney Pictures]]. The franchise is based on the [[anthropomorphic]] concept that all toys, unknown to humans, are secretly alive, and the films focus on a diverse group of toys that feature a classic cowboy named [[Sheriff Woody]] and a modern spaceman named [[Buzz Lightyear]]. The group unexpectedly embark on adventures that challenge and change them.

The first two films of the franchise were directed by [[John Lasseter]], and the third by [[Lee Unkrich]], who acted as the co-director of the second film (together with Lasseter and [[Ash Brannon]]). [[Josh Cooley]] is directing the upcoming [[Toy Story 4|fourth film]],&lt;ref name="Graser"&gt;{{Cite web | url = https://variety.com/2014/biz/news/john-lasseter-to-direct-toy-story-4-out-in-2017-1201349848/ | title = John Lasseter to Direct ‘Toy Story 4,’ Out in 2017 | work = [[Variety (magazine)|Variety]] | first = Marc | last = Graser | date = November 6, 2014 | access-date = November 6, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; set for release in June 2019.

All three films, produced on a total budget of $320 million, have grossed more than $1.9 billion worldwide. Each film set [[box office]] records, with the third included in the top 15 all time worldwide films. [[Film criticism|Critics]] have given all three films positive reviews.&lt;ref name="toystoryrt" /&gt;&lt;ref name="toystory2rt" /&gt;&lt;ref name="toystory3rt" /&gt; Special [[Blu-ray]] and [[DVD]] editions of ''[[Toy Story]]'' and ''[[Toy Story 2]]'' were released on March 23, 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://geekadelphia.com/2010/03/23/review-toy-story-1-and-2-on-blu-ray/|author=Dan|title=Toy Story 1 and 2 on Blu-Ray: Out Today! (Review) |publisher=geekadelphia.com|access-date=August 20, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; They were also re-released in theaters as a [[Disney Digital 3-D]] "double feature" for at least two weeks in October 2009.&lt;ref name="Empire3D" /&gt;

The series is the [[List of highest-grossing films#Highest-grossing franchises and film series|24th highest-grossing franchise]] worldwide, [[List of highest-grossing animated films#Highest-grossing animated franchises and film series|the fifth highest-grossing animated franchise]] (behind ''[[Despicable Me (franchise)|Despicable Me]]'', ''[[Shrek (franchise)|Shrek]]'', ''[[Ice Age (franchise)|Ice Age]]'', and ''[[Madagascar (franchise)|Madagascar]]''),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Movie Franchises|url=http://www.the-numbers.com/movies/franchises/sort/World|publisher=The Numbers|access-date=December 6, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; and is among the most critically acclaimed trilogies of all time. On November 1, 2011, all three ''Toy Story'' films were released in Disney Blu-ray 3D as a trilogy pack and as individual films.

==Films==
The ''Toy Story'' series consists of three [[CGI animated]] films: ''[[Toy Story]]'' (1995), ''[[Toy Story 2]]'' (1999), and ''[[Toy Story 3]]'' (2010). A fourth film, ''[[Toy Story 4]]'', is in production and set for release on June 21, 2019. ''Toy Story'' was the first feature-length film to be made entirely using computer-generated imagery. The films were produced by [[Pixar|Pixar Animation Studios]] and distributed by [[Walt Disney Pictures]].

The first and second films got a perfect 100%, and the third a 98% rating, on [[Rotten Tomatoes]]. The third film in the series is the [[List of highest-grossing animated films|third highest-grossing animated film]] and the [[List of highest-grossing films|18th highest-grossing film]] of all time. It also became the third animated film in history to be nominated for the [[Academy Award for Best Picture]], following ''[[Beauty and the Beast (1991 film)|Beauty and the Beast]]'' and ''[[Up (2009 film)|Up]]''.

===''Toy Story'' (1995)===
{{main|Toy Story}}
''Toy Story'', the first film in the franchise, was released on November 22, 1995. It was the first feature-length film created entirely by [[Computer-generated imagery|CGI]] and was directed by [[John Lasseter]]. The plot involves Andy, an imaginative young boy, getting a new Buzz Lightyear action figure for his birthday, causing Sheriff Woody, a vintage cowboy doll, to think that he has been replaced as Andy's favorite toy. In competing for Andy's attention, Woody accidentally knocks Buzz out a window, leading the other toys to believe he tried to murder Buzz. Determined to set things right, Woody attempts to save Buzz, and both must escape from the house of the next-door neighbor Sid Phillips, who likes to torture and destroy toys. The film was critically and financially successful, grossing over $361 million worldwide.&lt;ref name="toystoryrt" /&gt;&lt;ref name="toystoryboxmoj" /&gt; The film was later re-released in [[Disney Digital 3-D]] as part of a double feature, along with ''Toy Story 2'', for a 2-week run,&lt;ref name="Empire3D"&gt;{{cite news|last=Richards|first=Olly|url=http://www.empireonline.com/news/story.asp?NID=21856|title=Toy Story Movies Going 3D|work=[[Empire (magazine)|Empire]]|date=January 24, 2008|access-date=March 11, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; which was later extended due to its financial success.&lt;ref name=oct12update2&gt;{{cite news|last=Chen|first=David|title=Lee Unkrich Announces Kristen Schaal and Blake Clark Cast in Toy Story 3; Toy Story 3D Double Feature To Stay in Theaters|url=http://www.slashfilm.com/lee-unkrich-announces-kristen-schaal-and-blake-clark-cast-in-toy-story-3-toy-story-3d-double-feature-to-stay-in-theaters/|access-date=August 31, 2012|newspaper=SlashFilm|date=October 12, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===''Toy Story 2'' (1999)===
{{main|Toy Story 2}}
''Toy Story 2'', the second film in the franchise, was released on November 24, 1999. John Lasseter reprised his role as director. The plot involves Woody getting stolen by a greedy toy collector named Al McWhiggin. Buzz and several of Andy's toys set off to attempt to free Woody, who meanwhile has discovered his origins as a historic television star. ''Toy Story 2'' was not originally intended for release in theaters, but as a direct-to-video sequel to the original ''Toy Story'', with a 60-minute running time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Cohen|first=Karl|title=Toy Story 2 Is Not Your Typical Hollywood Sequel|url=http://www.awn.com/articles/reviews/toy-story-2-not-your-typical-hollywood-sequel|access-date=August 31, 2012|newspaper=Animation World Network|date=December 1, 1999}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, Disney's executives were impressed by the high quality of the in-work imagery for the sequel, and were also pressured by the main characters' voice actors [[Tom Hanks]] and [[Tim Allen]], so they decided to convert ''Toy Story 2'' into a theatrical film.&lt;ref name=WrapTimAllenSigned&gt;{{cite news|last=Sneider|first=Jeff|title=Exclusive: Tim Allen Signed On for 'Toy Story 4'|url=http://www.thewrap.com/movies/column-post/exclusive-tim-allen-return-toy-story-4-19245|access-date=August 31, 2012|newspaper=The Wrap|date=July 14, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; It turned out to be an even greater success than the original ''Toy Story'', grossing over $497 million worldwide.&lt;ref name=toystory2boxmoj /&gt; The film was re-released in [[Disney Digital 3-D]] as part of a double feature, along with ''Toy Story'', on October 2, 2009.&lt;ref name="Empire3D" /&gt;

===''Toy Story 3'' (2010)===
{{main|Toy Story 3}}
''Toy Story 3'', the third film in the franchise, was released on June 18, 2010, nearly 11 years after ''Toy Story 2'' was. It was the first ''Toy Story'' film not to be directed by John Lasseter (although he remained involved in the film as executive producer), but by [[Lee Unkrich]], who edited the first two films and co-directed the second.

The special follows the toys on their road trip when a flat tire leads Bonnie and her mother to spend the night in a roadside motel. After one of the toys goes missing, the others begin to search for it, but they too are picked off one by one. The toys discover that they are being targeted by the hotel manager's pet [[iguana]], Mr. Jones, who has been trained to steal the toys of his guests so that they can be sold via the Internet. The manager nearly succeeds in selling Woody and Jessie, but Jessie manages to escape—overcoming her old fear of [[Claustrophobia|being packed away]] in the process—and draw Bonnie's attention to the cabinet where the toys are being kept. As a result, Bonnie recovers her toys, and her mom calls in the police, who then presumably arrests the manager for theft.

==Impact==
''Toy Story'''s innovative computer animation had a large impact on the film industry. After the film's debut, various industries were interested in the technology used for the film. Graphics chip makers desired to compute imagery similar to the film's animation for personal computers; game developers wanted to learn how to replicate the animation for video games; and robotics researchers were interested in building [[artificial intelligence]] into their machines that compared to the lifelike characters in the film.&lt;ref name="ImpactPossible"&gt;{{cite news|last=Porter|first=Tom|author2=Galyn Susman |authorlink=Thomas Porter (Pixar)|title=Creating Lifelike Characters in Pixar Movies|url=https://cacm.acm.org/magazines/2000/1/7745-on-site-creating-lifelike-characters-in-pixar-movies/abstract|publisher=[[Communications of the ACM]]|date=January 1, 2000|access-date=March 13, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Various authors have also compared the film to an interpretation of ''[[Don Quixote]]'' as well as [[humanism]].&lt;ref name="TSQuixote"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Burningham|first=Bruce|year=2000|title=Walt Disney's Toy Story as Postmodern Don Quixote|journal=Cervantes|publisher=Cervantes Society of America|volume=20|issue=1|pages=157–174|url=http://www.h-net.org/~cervantes/csa/artics00/burningh.pdf|format=PDF|access-date=March 13, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="InfinityHeaven"&gt;{{cite news|first=Lucia K.B.|last=Hall|title=Toy Stories for Humanists?|url=http://www.accessmylibrary.com/coms2/summary_0286-27546351_ITM|publisher=The Humanist|date=March 1, 2000|access-date=March 13, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''World Series of Darts''' is a series of darts tournaments organised by the [[Professional Darts Corporation]].

Beginning in 2013, the World Series has comprised between two and seven tournaments across the world, where a mixture of the top-ranked PDC players take on local qualifiers in a knockout format. Since 2015, there has been a [[World Series of Darts Finals|finals tournament]] held annually in November at the [[Braehead Arena]] in [[Glasgow]], [[Scotland]], although in 2018, it moved to the Multiversum Schwechat in [[Vienna]], [[Austria]].

==History==
The World Series of Darts commenced in 2013 with the [[2013 Dubai Duty Free Darts Masters|Dubai Duty Free Darts Masters]]. The goal of these series of tournaments is to make darts more popular across the globe.

Later that year, the [[2013 Sydney Darts Masters|Sydney Darts Masters]] took place, which as well as including 8 top-ranked PDC players, also featured 8 players from [[Australia]] and [[New Zealand]] to take part in the tournament. In 2014, tournaments in [[2014 Singapore Darts Masters|Singapore]] and [[2014 Perth Darts Masters|Perth]] were added to the series, although this would be the only year that [[Singapore]] was used for an event.

In 2015, but the [[2015 Japan Darts Masters|Japan tournament]] (later renamed as [[Tokyo]] for the [[2016 Tokyo Darts Masters|2016 tournament]]) and [[2015 Auckland Darts Masters|Auckland]] were added. Also in 2015, ended the series with the '''[[World Series of Darts Finals]]'''. In 2016, the PDC expanded into [[China]] with the addition of the [[2016 Shanghai Darts Masters|Shanghai Darts Masters]], and in 2017, both [[North America]] and [[Europe]] had their own tournaments with the [[2017 US Darts Masters|US Darts Masters]] in [[Las Vegas]], and the [[2017 German Darts Masters (World Series of Darts)|German Darts Masters]] in [[Düsseldorf]], along with [[2017 Melbourne Darts Masters|Melbourne]] over from Sydney in the Australian leg of the tour.

In 2018, [[Brisbane]] will join the fray and replace Perth, whilst Dubai, which will have a one-year hiatus.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.pdc.tv/news/2017/11/05/brisbane-host-world-series-2018&lt;/ref&gt; It was also confirmed that [[Vienna]], [[Austria]] will replace [[Glasgow]] as the host of the World Series Finals in 2018.

==Venues==
Since the first tournament began in 2013, the World Series has visited ten countries including the Finals.
