'''Asian Highway 6''' ('''AH6''') is a route in the [[Asian Highway Network]] in [[Asia]] and [[Europe]]. It runs from [[Busan]], South Korea (on {{AHN-AH|1|ROK}}) to the border between [[Russia]] and [[Belarus]]. Altogether it is {{convert|10,533|km|mi}} long.

For much of its Russian stretch, AH6 coincides with the unofficial [[Trans-Siberian Highway]] and, west of the [[Ural Mountains]], with [[European route E30]] of the [[International E-road network]].

'''Algeria–Canada relations''' refer to [[Interstate relations]] between [[Algeria]] and [[Canada]]. Canada recognized Algeria following its independence from France in 1962, and formal diplomatic relations were established two years later in 1964.

== Bilateral Visits ==
[[File:Algeria, Ottawa.JPG|thumb|right|Embassy of Algeria in Ottawa]]
In 2006, Governor General [[Michaëlle Jean]] visited Algeria as part of a tour of Africa, during which she promoted the partnership between Canada and Algeria in assisting in African development.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.acdi-cida.gc.ca/acdi-cida/acdi-cida.nsf/eng/RAC-111616820-SSR Governor General Michaëlle Jean represents Canada on state visit to sub-Saharan and North Africa - Canadian International Development Agency (CIDA)&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; In 2010, Algerian President [[Abdelaziz Bouteflika]] visited Canada to take part in the [[36th G8 summit|G8 summit]] in [[Muskoka]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.g8.utoronto.ca/summit/2010muskoka/delegations.html Muskoka Participants&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Lawrence Cannon]], then the Minister of Foreign Affairs, visited Algeria in January 2011 and met with his Algerian counterpart, Minister of Foreign Affairs Mourad Medelci.

== Economic Activity ==

Algeria is Canada's top trading partner in Africa. There is a large [[trade imbalance]] between Algeria and Canada in favour of the Algerians. Canadian exports to Algeria totalled $352 million in 2010, mostly in agricultural products such as [[Durum wheat]], while Canadian imports from Algeria totalled $3.8 billion, 99% of which was crude oil.

== Migration ==

The Algerian community in Canada numbers approximately 50,000 people, most of whom reside in and around [[Montreal]]. [[Air Algérie]] operates one daily flight from Montreal to Algiers to serve this market.

Algeria claimed that two Canadians were among the Jihadi militants responsible for a hostage taking at an isolated natural gas plant in the [[Sahara desert]] in January 2013.  Canada launched its own investigation. In March, the [[Royal Canadian Mounted Police|RCMP]] confirmed that one Canadian's body was identified to be related to the attack.  The investigation was slowed by the fact that Canada and Algeria do not share intelligence information.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cbc.ca/news/world/story/2013/03/18/canadian-killed-in-algeria.html Canadian died during Algerian gas plant attack, RCMP say]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Cake''' is a form of sweet dessert that is typically [[baking|baked]]. In their oldest forms, cakes were modifications of [[bread]]s, but cakes now cover a wide range of preparations that can be simple or elaborate, and that share features with other desserts such as [[pastry|pastries]], [[meringue]]s, [[custard]]s, and [[pie]]s.

Typical cake ingredients are flour, sugar, [[egg (food)|eggs]], butter or [[Vegetable oil|oil]] or [[margarine]], a liquid, and leavening agents, such as [[baking soda]] or [[baking powder]]. Common additional ingredients and flavourings include [[Dried fruit|dried]], [[candied fruit|candied]], or fresh fruit, [[nut (fruit)|nuts]], [[cocoa powder|cocoa]], and [[extract]]s such as vanilla, with numerous substitutions for the primary ingredients. Cakes can also be filled with [[fruit preserves]], nuts or dessert sauces (like [[custard|pastry cream]]), iced with [[buttercream]] or other [[Icing (food)|icings]], and decorated with [[marzipan]], piped borders, or candied fruit.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAGxK7i2E4g&amp;t=01m22s Cake finishes]. YouTube. Retrieved 23 December 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

Cake is often served as a celebratory dish on ceremonial occasions, such as weddings, [[Anniversary|anniversaries]], and birthdays. There are countless cake recipes; some are bread-like, some are rich and elaborate, and many are centuries old. Cake making is no longer a complicated procedure; while at one time considerable labor went into cake making (particularly the [[whisk]]ing of egg foams), baking equipment and directions have been simplified so that even the most amateur cook may bake a cake.

==History==
[[File:Blood Orange Chiffon Cake with Mango Curd (Unsplash).jpg|thumb|Blood Orange Chiffon Cake with mango curd]]

The term "cake" has a long history. The word itself is of [[Viking]] origin, from the [[Old Norse]] word "kaka".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.devlaming.co.za/the-history-of-cakes The history of cakes]. Devlaming.co.za. Retrieved 23 December 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

The ancient Greeks called cake πλακοῦς (''plakous''), which was derived from the word for "flat", πλακόεις (''plakoeis''). It was baked using flour mixed with eggs, milk, nuts and honey. They also had a cake called "satura", which was a flat heavy cake. During the Roman period, the name for cake became "placenta" which was derived from the Greek term. A placenta was baked on a pastry base or inside a pastry case.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=whatscookingamerica.net |url=https://whatscookingamerica.net/History/CakeHistory.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Greeks invented beer as a [[leavening agent|leavener]], [[frying]] [[fritter]]s in [[olive oil]], and [[cheesecake]]s using [[goat's milk]].&lt;ref&gt;Castella, Krystina (2010). ''A World of Cake: 150 Recipes for Sweet Traditions From Cultures Around the World'', pp. 3–4. {{ISBN|978-1-60342-576-6}}.&lt;/ref&gt; In [[ancient Rome]], basic bread dough was sometimes enriched with butter, eggs, and honey, which produced a sweet and cake-like baked good.&lt;ref name="isbn0-19-280352-2"&gt;{{cite book |title=An A–Z of food and drink |publisher=Oxford University Press |year=2002 |isbn=0-19-280352-2 |location=Oxford [Oxfordshire] |author=Ayto, John}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Latin]] poet [[Ovid]] refers his and his brother's birthday party and cake in his first book of exile, ''[[Tristia]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Ov. ''Tris''. IV. X:12.&lt;/ref&gt;

Early cakes in England were also essentially bread: the most obvious differences between a "cake" and "bread" were the round, flat shape of the cakes, and the cooking method, which turned cakes over once while cooking, while bread was left upright throughout the baking process.&lt;ref name="isbn0-19-280352-2" /&gt;

[[Sponge cake]]s, leavened with beaten eggs, originated during [[the Renaissance]], possibly in [[Spain]].&lt;ref&gt;Castella, Krystina (2010). ''A World of Cake: 150 Recipes for Sweet Traditions From Cultures Around the World'', pp. 6–7. {{ISBN|978-1-60342-576-6}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Cake mixes===
{{main article|Baking mix}}
[[File:Cake mix in plastic packet photo.JPG|thumb|[[Baking mix|Cake mix]] in plastic packets]]
During the [[Great Depression]], there was a surplus of [[molasses]] and the need to provide easily made food to millions of economically depressed people in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bonappetit.com/entertaining-style/pop-culture/article/cake-mix-history |title=A History of the Cake Mix, the Invention That Redefined 'Baking' |last=Park |first=Michael |website=bonappetit.com |publisher=Bon Appétit |date=2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; One company patented a cake-bread mix in order to deal with this economic situation, and thereby established the first line of cake in a box. In so doing, cake as it is known today became a [[mass production|mass-produced]] good rather than a home- or bakery-made specialty.

Later, during the [[post-war boom]], other American companies (notably [[General Mills]]) developed this idea further, marketing cake mix on the principle of convenience, especially to housewives. When sales dropped heavily in the 1950s, marketers discovered that baking cakes, once a task at which housewives could exercise skill and creativity, had become dispiriting. This was a period in American ideological history when women, retired from the war-time labor force, were confined to the [[Separate spheres|domestic sphere]], while still exposed to the blossoming consumerism in the US.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Catalano |first=Christina |year=2002 |title=Shaping the American Woman: Feminism and Advertising in the 1950s |url=http://digitalcommons.iwu.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1054&amp;context=constructing |journal=Constructing the Past |volume=3 |issue=1 |page=45 |accessdate=25 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; This inspired [[psychologist]] [[Ernest Dichter]] to find a solution to the cake mix problem in [[icing (food)|frosting]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.snopes.com/business/genius/cakemix.asp |title=Something Eggstra |publisher=Snopes.com |accessdate=25 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since making the cake was so simple, housewives and other in-home cake makers could expend their creative energy on [[cake decorating]] inspired by, among other things, photographs in magazines of elaborately decorated cakes.

Ever since, cake in a box has become a staple of supermarkets, and is complemented with frosting in a can.

[[File:Chocolate cake - be Ehud Kenan.jpg|thumb|A [[fudge cake]] is a type of [[chocolate cake]]]]

Cakes are broadly divided into several categories, based primarily on ingredients and mixing techniques. 

Although clear examples of the difference between cake and bread are easy to find, the precise classification has always been elusive.&lt;ref name="isbn0-19-280352-2" /&gt; For example, [[banana bread]] may be properly considered either a [[quick bread]] or a cake.
* [[Butter cake]]s are made from creamed butter, sugar, eggs, and flour. They rely on the combination of butter and sugar beaten for an extended time to incorporate air into the batter.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Robbins |first1=Mary Jane |title=Creaming butter and sugar |url=http://www.kingarthurflour.com/blog/2015/04/27/creaming-butter-sugar/ |website=King Arthur Flour |accessdate=6 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; A classic [[pound cake]] is made with a pound each of butter, sugar, eggs, and flour. [[Baking powder]] is in many butter cakes, such as [[Sponge cake#Victoria sponge|Victoria sponge]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Cloake |first1=Felicity |title=How to make the perfect Victoria sponge cake |url=https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/wordofmouth/2013/may/16/how-bake-perfect-victoria-sponge-cake |accessdate=6 December 2015 |work=Guardian |date=16 May 2013 |quote="[Victoria sponge] is a misnomer, because a true sponge, of the kind used in Swiss rolls, is made from a whisked mixture of eggs, sugar and flour."}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ingredients are sometimes mixed without creaming the butter, using recipes for simple and quick cakes.
* [[Sponge cake]]s (or foam cakes) are made from whipped eggs, sugar, and flour. They rely primarily on trapped air in a protein matrix (generally of beaten eggs) to provide [[leavening]], sometimes with a bit of [[baking powder]] or other chemical leaven added as insurance. Sponge cakes are thought to be the oldest cakes made without yeast. An [[angel food cake]] is a white sponge cake that uses only the whites of the eggs and is traditionally baked in a tube pan. The French [[Génoise cake|Génoise]] is a sponge cake that includes [[clarified butter]]. Highly decorated sponge cakes with lavish toppings are sometimes called ''gateau'', the French word for cake.
* [[Chiffon cake]]s are sponge cakes with vegetable oil, which adds moistness.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Medrich |first1=Alice |title=Joy of Cooking |date=1997 |publisher=Scribner |location=New York |isbn=0-684-81870-1 |page=949}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Chocolate cake]]s are butter cakes, sponge cakes, or other cakes flavored with melted chocolate or [[Cocoa solids|cocoa powder]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Berry |first1=Mary |title=Chocolate sponge cake |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/food/recipes/chocolate_cake_48307 |accessdate=6 December 2015 |work=Food: Recipes |publisher=BBC}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[German chocolate cake]] is a variety of chocolate cake. [[Fudge cake]]s are [[chocolate cake]]s that contains [[fudge]].
* [[Coffee cake]] is generally thought of as a cake to serve with coffee or tea at breakfast or at a [[coffee break]]. Some types use yeast as a leavening agent while others use baking soda or baking powder. These cakes often have a crumb topping called [[streusel]] or a light glaze drizzle.
* Baked flourless cakes include baked [[cheesecake]]s and [[flourless chocolate cake]]s.  Cheesecakes, despite their name, aren't really cakes at all. Cheesecakes are in fact custard [[pie]]s, with a filling made mostly of some form of cheese (often [[cream cheese]], [[mascarpone]], [[ricotta]], or the like), and have very little flour added, although a flour-based or [[graham cracker crust]] may be used. Cheesecakes are also very old, with evidence of honey-sweetened cakes dating back to ancient Greece.
* Butter or oil [[layer cake]]s include most of the traditional cakes used as birthday cakes, etc., and those sold as packaged cakes. Baking powder or bicarbonate of soda are used to provide both lift and a moist texture. Many flavorings and ingredients may be added; examples include [[devil's food cake]], [[carrot cake]], and [[banana bread]].
* [[Yeast]] cakes are the oldest and are very similar to yeast breads. Such cakes are often very traditional in form, and include such pastries as [[babka (food)|babka]] and [[stollen]].[[File:Birthday cake (14373861251).jpg|200px|thumb|Birthday cake ]]

Some varieties of cake are widely available in the form of cake mixes, wherein some of the ingredients (usually flour, sugar, flavoring, baking powder, and sometimes some form of fat) are premixed, and the cook needs add only a few extra ingredients, usually eggs, water, and sometimes vegetable oil or butter. While the diversity of represented styles is limited, cake mixes do provide an easy and readily available homemade option for cooks who are not accomplished bakers.

==Special-purpose cakes==
[[File:Special occasion cakes.jpg|thumb|Cake made for a [[baby shower]] with edible decorations, an example of [[edible art]]]]
Cakes may be classified according to the occasion for which they are intended. For example, [[wedding cake]]s, [[birthday cake]]s, cakes for [[first communion]], Christmas cakes, [[Halloween]] cakes, and Passover plava (a type of sponge cake sometimes made with [[matzo]] meal) are all identified primarily according to the celebration they are intended to accompany. The cutting of a wedding cake constitutes a social ceremony in some cultures. The Ancient Roman marriage ritual of ''[[confarreatio]]'' originated in the sharing of a cake.

Particular types of cake may be associated with particular festivals, such as [[stollen]] or [[Bûche de Noël|chocolate log]] (at Christmas), [[babka (food)|babka]] and [[simnel cake]] (at Easter), or [[mooncake]]. There has been a long tradition of decorating an iced cake at Christmas time; other cakes associated with Christmas include chocolate log and [[mince pies]].

A Lancashire Courting Cake is a fruit-filled cake baked by a fiancée for her betrothed. The cake has been described as "somewhere between a firm sponge – with a greater proportion of flour to fat and eggs than a Victoria sponge cake – and a shortbread base and was proof of the bride-to-be's baking skills".  Traditionally it is a two-layer cake filled and topped with strawberries or raspberries and whipped cream.&lt;ref name="Lancashire Life"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.lancashirelife.co.uk/food-drink/the_history_of_the_courting_cake_a_lancashire_tradition_1_1645135 |title=The history of the Courting Cake, a Lancashire tradition |publisher=Lancashire Life |accessdate=9 October 2015 |author=1 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Shapes==

Cakes are frequently described according to their physical form. Cakes may be small and intended for individual consumption. Larger cakes may be made with the intention of being sliced and served as part of a meal or social function. Common shapes include:
* [[Bundt cake]]s
* [[Cake balls]]
* [[Cone (geometry)|Conical]], such as the [[Kransekake]]
* [[Cupcake]]s and [[Madeleine (cake)|madeleines]], which are both sized for a single person
* [[Layer cake]]s, frequently baked in a [[springform pan]] and decorated
* [[Sheet cake]]s, simple, flat, rectangular cakes baked in [[sheet pan]]s
* [[Swiss roll]]s

==Cake flour==
{{Main article|Flour}}
Special '''cake flour''' with a high starch-to-gluten ratio is made from fine-textured, soft, low-protein wheat. It is strongly bleached, and compared to all-purpose flour, cake flour tends to result in cakes with a lighter, less dense texture.&lt;ref&gt;[http://whatscookingamerica.net/Bread/FlourTypes.htm Types of Flour]. Whatscookingamerica.net. Retrieved 23 December 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, it is frequently specified or preferred in cakes meant to be soft, light, and/or bright white, such as [[angel food cake]]. However, if cake flour is called for, a substitute can be made by replacing a small percentage of all-purpose flour with cornstarch or removing two tablespoons from each cup of all-purpose flour.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gourmetsleuth.com/equivalents_substitutions.asp?index=C&amp;tid=591 Cake flour properties and substitutions].

==Cake decorating==
{{main article|Cake decorating}}
[[File:Piping buttercream onto cake.JPG|thumb|[[Cake decorating|Cake decoration]] – [[buttercream]] swirls being piped onto the sides of this cake with a [[pastry bag]]]]
A finished cake is often enhanced by covering it with [[Icing (food)|icing]], or frosting, and toppings such as [[sprinkles]], which are also known as "jimmies" in certain parts of the United States and "hundreds and thousands" in the United Kingdom. Frosting is usually made from powdered (icing) sugar, sometimes a fat of some sort, milk or cream, and often flavorings such as [[Vanilla|vanilla extract]] or [[Chocolate|cocoa powder]]. Some decorators use a rolled [[Fondant icing|fondant]] icing. Commercial bakeries tend to use [[lard]] for the fat, and often whip the lard to introduce air bubbles. This makes the icing light and spreadable. Home bakers either use lard, butter, [[margarine]], or some combination thereof. Sprinkles are small firm pieces of sugar and oils that are colored with [[food coloring]]. In the late 20th century, new cake decorating products became available to the public. These include several specialized sprinkles and even methods to print pictures and transfer the image onto a cake.

Special tools are needed for more complex [[cake decorating]], such as [[pastry bag|piping bags]] and various piping tips, syringes and [[embossing mat]]s. To use a piping bag or syringe, a piping tip is attached to the bag or syringe using a coupler. The bag or syringe is partially filled with icing which is sometimes colored. Using different piping tips and various techniques, a cake decorator can make many different designs. Basic decorating tips include open star, closed star, basketweave, round, drop flower, leaf, multi, petal, and specialty tips. An embossing mat is used to create embossed effects. A [[cake turntable]] that cakes are spun upon may be used in cake decoration.

[[Royal icing]], [[marzipan]] (or a less sweet version, known as almond paste), fondant icing
(also known as sugarpaste), and buttercream are used as covering icings and to create decorations. Floral [[sugarcraft]] or wired sugar flowers are an important part of cake decoration. Cakes for special occasions, such as wedding cakes, are traditionally rich fruit cakes or occasionally [[Madeira cake]]s, that are covered with marzipan and iced using royal icing or sugar-paste. They are finished with piped borders (made with royal icing) and adorned with a piped message, wired sugar flowers, hand-formed fondant flowers, marzipan fruit, piped flowers, or crystallized fruits or flowers such as [[grapes]] or [[Viola (plant)|violets]].

The 12 '''[[canton (subnational entity)|cantons]]''' ({{lang-fr|cantons}}, {{lang-de|Kantone}}, {{lang-lb|Kantounen}}) of the [[Luxembourg|Grand Duchy of Luxembourg]] are areas of local government at the first level of [[Local administrative unit]] (LAU-1) in the [[European Union]]'s [[Nomenclature of Territorial Units for Statistics]] for [[Eurostat]] purposes. They were subdivisions of the three [[Districts of Luxembourg]] until 2015, when the district level of government was abolished. The cantons are in turn subdivided into 102 [[Communes of Luxembourg|communes]] (i.e. municipalities).

'''Catalan myths and legends''' are the traditional [[mythology|myth]]s and [[legend]]s of the [[Catalan language|Catalan]]-speaking world, especially [[Catalonia]] itself, passed down for generations as part of that region's [[popular culture]].

==Mythological figures==
Among the figures of Catalan mythology are:
*[[Aloja (mythology)|Aloja]] - In Catalan mythology an Aloja, also known as Dona d'aigua, Goja or Paitida, is a feminine being that lives in places with fresh water. This "water-woman" can turn into water blackbirds.
*[[Banyoles monster]]
*[[Bubota]]
*[[Catalan mythology about witches]] - Catalan tradition distinguished between bruixeria ("witchcraft") based on an explicit compact with the Devil, and fetilleria (deriving from a word related to "fetish", and Old Portuguese feitiço), magic worked through charms and fetishes. The former was considered inherently evil, while the latter might include the working of magical cures. In Catalan popular culture, there are a large number of legends about witches. In the popular imagination, a witch is a woman who, by means of a pact with the Devil, has acquired supernatural power, which she uses for her own benefit and for evil purposes.
*[[Carnestoltes]]
*[[Cocollona]]
*[[Comte Arnau]]
*[[Comte Estruch]]
*[[Cucafera]]
*[[Dip (Catalan myth)|Dip]] - In Catalan myth, Dip is an evil, black, hairy dog, an emissary of the Devil, who sucks people's blood.
*[[Dona d'aigua]] - (See Aloja)
*[[Donyet]]
*[[European dragon|Dragons]]
**Drac (a dragon, generally male)
**[[Víbria]] (specifically female)
*[[Encantaria]]
*[[Follet]]
*[[Gambutzí]]
*[[Goja]] - (See Aloja)
*[[Fairy|Fada]] - Hada&lt;ref&gt;Típicas también de zonas orientales del pirineo aragonés&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[Home del sac]] (man of the sack)
*[[Home dels nassos]] (man of the noses)
*[[Marraco]]
*[[Martinet]]
*[[Minairó]]
*El Moro Musa
*[[Muladona]]
*[[Negret]]
*[[Nitus]]
*[[Paitida]] - (See Aloja)
*[[Papu]]
*[[Peix Nicolau]] - Peje Nicolao
*[[Pellofa]]
*[[Pesanta]]
*[[Peix Nicolau]]
*[[Puigmal (mythology)|Puigmal]]
*[[Tió de Nadal]]
*The [[Three Wise Men]] or Tres Reis Mags d'Orient
**[[Page Gregory]]
**[[Page Fumera]]
*[[Tombatossals]]
*[[Vella Quaresma]]
*[[Víbria]]

==Generic figures==
In [[Catalonia]] those characters that are invoked to induce fear in children for practical purposes, for example to avoid speaking to strangers or leaving home alone are called Espantamainades (Espantachiquillos). At the anthropological level, sometimes they are manifestations of the fears of the unknown and inexplicable in nature. Some are local representations related to those figures also existing in other cultures, such as witches, Goblin and the bogeyman. Others are purely local variations, such as [[Marraco]] the peasant and the dips.

Luís Pires returned to Portugal just after reaching Cape Verde. Vasco de Ataíde, Bartolomeu Dias, Simão de Pina and Aires Gomes' ships were lost near the Cape of Good Hope. The ship commanded by Diogo Dias separated and discovered Madagascar. He was then the first to reach the Red Sea by boat. Nuno Leitão da Cunha, Nicolau Coelho, Sancho de Tovar, Simão de Miranda, Pero de Ataíde did the entire trip to India.

In 1520, he discovers what is now known as the [[Strait of Magellan]]. In 1521 he reaches the [[Marianas]] and then the [[Homonhon Island|island of Homonhon]] in the Philippines. Some time after, Magellan is killed in what is known as the [[Battle of Mactan]]. The rest of the crew sails to [[Palawan]] (Philippines), and then to [[Brunei]] and [[Borneo]]. They then reach [[Tidore]] in the Maluku Islands avoiding the Portuguese. Only one ship, commanded by [[Juan Sebastián Elcano]], returns to Spain in 1522 with 18 men remaining.
* 1524: Third trip of [[Vasco da Gama]] to India.

The captain of the ship is named Avan aka "The Pirate".
* 1556: The Dominican [[Gaspar da Cruz]] is the first modern missionary to go in China. He traveled to [[Guangzhou]] in 1556 and wrote the first complete book on China and the [[Ming Dynasty]] that was published in Europe;  it included information on its geography, provinces, royalty, official class, bureaucracy, shipping, architecture, farming, craftsmanship, merchant affairs, clothing, religious and social customs, music and instruments, writing, education, and justice.

* 1582: The Italian [[Jesuit]] priest and missionary [[Matteo Ricci]] reaches the Portuguese settlement of [[Macau]] in Ming China and in 1601 becomes the first European to be invited into the Ming imperial palace of the [[Forbidden City]] in [[Beijing]], at the behest of the [[Wanli Emperor]] who sought his services at court, particularly for his expertise in [[History of astronomy|astronomy]]. In 1602 Ricci and his Chinese translator [[Li Zhizao]] would co-publish the first [[world map]] in [[Chinese language|Chinese]], the ''[[Kunyu Wanguo Quantu]]'' which greatly expanded both Chinese and Japanese [[Chinese cartography|knowledge of global geography]].
* 1595: The Dutchman [[Jan Huyghen van Linschoten]] published his ''Reys-gheschrift vande navigatien der Portugaloysers in Orienten'' (Travel Accounts of Portuguese Navigation in the Orient) which was translated into English and German in 1598. It gave access to secret Portuguese information, including the nautical maps which had been well guarded for over a century. The book thus broke the Portuguese monopoly on the sea trade with Asia.

The '''Caernarfonshire flag''' ({{lang-cy|Baner Sir Gaernarfon}}) is the flag of the historic [[Wales|Welsh]] [[Caernarfonshire|county of Caernarfon]]. The origins of the emblem of the three eagles arranged in fess on a green field revolve around the ancient [[Kingdom of Gwynedd|King of Gwynedd]], [[Owain Gwynedd]], to whom the symbol was attributed as his [[coat of arms]]. It was registered with the [[Flag Institute]] in March 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://abcounties.co.uk/news/137-caernarfonshire-flag-registered|title=Caernarfonshire Flag Registered|publisher=[[Association of British Counties]]|accessdate=28 March 2012|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120414205604/http://www.abcounties.co.uk/news/137-caernarfonshire-flag-registered|archivedate=14 April 2012|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

__TOC__
==History==
Owain Gwynedd was born around 1100 and became King of Gwynedd in 1137. In 1415, the [[Battle of Agincourt]] was fought in which the Caernarfonshire units were reputed to have fought under a banner of three golden eagles on green in honour of Owain Gwynedd. [[Michael Drayton]] records this in his work ''The Battaile of Agincourt'' in 1627.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=[[Michael Drayton]]|title=The Battaile of Agincourt|publisher=Charles Whittingham|date=1893, first published 1627|page=33}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In his 1920 work on county identities ''Story of the Shire'', Frederick Hackwood calls the three golden eagles of Caernarfonshire as an "authentic" and "significant" badge of the county, as well as reciting their association to the Romans of antiquity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Frederick Hackwood|title=The Story of the Shire: Being the Lore, History and Evolution of English County Institutions|date=1920|page=262}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''globally integrated enterprise''' is a term coined in 2006 by [[Sam Palmisano]], the then CEO of [[IBM]] Corp, used to denote "a company that fashions its strategy, its management, and its operations in pursuit of a new goal: the integration of [[Manufacturing|production]] and [[Value chain|value delivery]] worldwide."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.ibm.com/ibm/governmentalprograms/samforeignaffairs.pdf | title = The Globally Integrated Enterprise | first = Sam | last = Palmisano | date = 15 March 2006 | accessdate = 10 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==The Argument==
Palmisano argues that in the [[international]] model of the 20th century, most operations were centred in their home country, with only elements of sales and distribution happening overseas.
The multinational model of the 21st century&amp;mdash;in which companies created small versions of themselves in each country&amp;mdash;was a response to the [[trade barriers]] that arose after the [[World Wars]].  For IBM&amp;mdash;Palmisano's employer&amp;mdash;this was a successful model because it enabled the company to grow in those markets, understand local customer requirements and cultivate local talent.  But it also created [[wikt:redundancy|redundancy]] or [[wikt:duplication|duplication]] as each country had its own [[Back office|back-office]] functions, such as&amp;mdash; [[Supply chain|supply]], [[procurement]], [[finance]] and [[human resources]].

Now the globally integrated enterprise can locate functions anywhere in the world, based on the right cost, skills and environment, argues Palmisano.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Barker|first=Colin|title=IBM boss spells out a better future|url=http://news.cnet.com/IBM-boss-spells-out-a-better-future/2100-1014_3-6082779.html|accessdate=26 September 2012|date=12 June 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, IBM now has one supply chain; and this new [[Organizational structure|organizational]] [[Macrostructure (sociology)|macrostructure]] has [[emergence|emerged]] because [[Complex adaptive system#General properties|everything is connected]], and work can move to the place where it is performed cheapest. This approach is made possible due to the rise of [[globalization]], and coming down of many of the barriers that haltered [[cross-border]] [[commerce]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Globalisation's offspring|url=http://www.economist.com/node/8960441?story_id=8960441|accessdate=26 September 2012|newspaper=Economist|date=4 April 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Palmisano mentions the ''Law of Global Integration'', driven by three forces&amp;mdash;economics, expertise and openness&amp;mdash;without explicitly stating what it is or how it can be verified.

==Criticisms==
[[Brad Setser]] of [[RGE Monitor|Roubini Global Economics (RGE) Monitor]] wrote:
:'In my view, this underscores a key element of tension in America’s current backlash against globalization that was not evident in the late 1980s. Today, the pressures are being borne disproportionately by labor, whereas 20 years ago, capital and labor were in the struggle together. In the late 1980s, many of the once proud icons of Corporate America were fighting for competitive survival at the same time that US workers were feeling the heat of global competition. The pain was, in effect, balanced. Today, US companies, as seen through the lens of corporate profitability, are thriving as never before while the American [[workforce]] is increasingly isolated in its competitive squeeze. In essence, [[Capital (economics)|capital]] and [[Labour (economics)|labor]] are working very much at cross purposes in the current climate, whereas back in the late 1980s they were both in the same boat.'&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.relooney.info/0_New_2372.pdf |title= Global Protectionist Threats: Then and Now |date= 26 January 2007 |accessdate= 10 June 2012 }}{{dead link|date=January 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Golden-Agri Resources'''  (GAR) is a Singaporean [[palm oil]] company. It is listed on the [[Singapore Stock Exchange]] since 1999.
&lt;ref&gt;Helena Varkkey, ''The Haze Problem in Southeast Asia'' (Abingdon: Routledge, 2015), p. 101&lt;/ref&gt;
In May 2015, its market capitalization was $4.1&amp;nbsp;billion.&lt;ref name="forbes"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.forbes.com/companies/golden-agri-resources/|title=Company: Golden Agri-Resources|publisher=forbes.com|accessdate=30 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Sheikh Roshini Begum is its CEO. [[Alnoor ]] is a subsidiary of GAR.
[[Lew Syn Pau]] used to serve as a member of the Singaporean Parliament for 13 years and is a member of the board of directors of the firm.
&lt;ref name="goldenagri"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.goldenagri.com.sg/about_boarddirectors.php |title=Golden Agri-Resources: About Us |publisher=goldenagri.com.sg |accessdate=30 May 2016 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160630071633/http://www.goldenagri.com.sg/about_boarddirectors.php |archivedate=30 June 2016 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;ref&gt;Helena Varkkey, ''The Haze Problem in Southeast Asia'' (Abingdon: Routledge, 2015), p. 90&lt;/ref&gt;
According to [[Greenpeace]], GAR has six concessions on peatlands in [[Riau]], with an estimated total area of 20,000 hectares.&lt;ref&gt;Helena Varkkey, ''The Haze Problem in Southeast Asia'' (Abingdon: Routledge, 2015), p. 131&lt;/ref&gt;
GAR was reported to have 1,880 hectares of peat in [[Central Kalimantan]] and 1,330 hectares in [[West Kalimantan]], while claiming a zero-deforestation footprint.&lt;ref&gt;Helena Varkkey, ''The Haze Problem in Southeast Asia'' (Abingdon: Routledge, 2015), p. 132&lt;/ref&gt;
Greenpeace also discovered 322 hotspots on five to GAR's concessions in Central Kalimantan.
&lt;ref&gt;Helena Varkkey, ''The Haze Problem in Southeast Asia'' (Abingdon: Routledge, 2015), p. 143&lt;/ref&gt;
GAR denied these accusations and said to have a zero-burning policy since 1997.&lt;ref&gt;Helena Varkkey, ''The Haze Problem in Southeast Asia'' (Abingdon: Routledge, 2015), p. 143&lt;/ref&gt;
Interviews with senior officers revealed evidence to the contrary.&lt;ref&gt;Helena Varkkey, ''The Haze Problem in Southeast Asia'' (Abingdon: Routledge, 2015), p. 143&lt;/ref&gt;
In about 2010, companies such as Burger King, Unilever and Nestlé cancelled their supplier contracts with Singapore-listed GAR subsidiaries due to unsustainable farming practices.

'''Halušky''' ({{IPA-cs|ɦaluʃkɪ|IPA}} in [[Czech language|Czech]] and [[Slovak language|Slovak]], singular: ''haluška''; {{lang-hu|galuska}}, ''haluska'' or ''nokedli''; {{lang-ro|gălușcă}}; {{lang-sr|galuška}};  {{lang-uk|галушка}}; {{lang-lt|virtinukai}}) are a traditional variety of thick, soft [[noodle]]s or [[dumpling]]s cooked in the Central and Eastern European cuisines ([[Slovakia]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://travel.spectator.sk/articles/327/ |title=Halušky: Humble King of the Slovak Kitchen |first=Rachel |last=Salaman |accessdate=2008-09-11 |work=Spectacular Slovakia |year=2003}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.spectator.sk/articles/view/11624/9/ |title=Halušky: Like gnocchi only smaller and tastier |first=Rachel |last=Salaman |accessdate=2008-09-11 |work=[[The Slovak Spectator]] |date=2003-01-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.spectator.sk/articles/view/4209/9/ |title=Three liters of bryndzové halušky small work for hefty men in national eating competition |first=Matt |last=Reynolds |accessdate=2008-09-11 |work=[[The Slovak Spectator]] |date=1999-06-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Czech Republic]], [[Poland]], [[Serbia]], [[Ukraine]], [[Lithuania]], [[Romania]] and [[Hungary]]). Halušky can refer to the dumplings themselves, or to the complete dish.

==Preparation==
The dumplings can be made from dough spread in a thin layer on a wooden cutting board, then cut and scraped off in small pieces which are dropped into boiling water. They can also be made with a special perforated halušky strainer forming small (1/2   &amp;times; 2–3&amp;nbsp;cm) irregularly-shaped lumps which drop directly into boiling water as a thinner batter-like dough is pressed through the openings of the strainer.

Although recipes vary from region to region, in general [[flour]] is mixed with water to form a [[Batter (cooking)|batter]]. Finely grated [[potato]]es can be added to the batter. Eggs may be added, but Slovak [[bryndzové halušky]] do not contain them. Flour and mashed potatoes are enough to form a batter. After cooking, they are mixed with various ingredients, such as cheese, meat, [[butter]], cabbage, onions, or combinations of these.

==Variations==
[[Bryndzové halušky]] is a traditional [[Slovak cuisine|Slovak]] dish also found in [[Moravia]] in the eastern part of the [[Czech cuisine|Czech Republic]]. [[Strapačky]] is a similar Slovak dish, where stewed sauerkraut is used instead of bryndza. In Hungary, galuska are often eaten with meat stews, such as [[goulash]] or [[pörkölt]].

In the [[United States]], most adapted halusky recipes call for egg noodles rather than potato dumplings.  Some American cooks include loose, cut, and fried green cabbage (a convergence with [[strapačky]], compelled by simplicity, difficulty in finding [[bryndza]] or acceptable substitutes, and access to affordable cabbage in areas with prominent existing Slavic and Germanic immigration).

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1409">'''International Child Care Fund Holland''' is a small [[non-governmental organization]] that supports a project in [[Kibaale]], a small town in the south of [[Uganda]].  The project aims at helping [[AIDS]] victims.  In this poor area of Africa, many adults are infected with [[HIV]].  When they die, the children are left behind.  At the project they receive the support they need.  Education is provided at the school (nursery, primary, secondary, vocational).  A clinic provides the only affordable medical help in the area.

[[Stichting]] ICCF Holland is registered in [[Venlo]], the Netherlands.  All the work is done by volunteers, which makes it possible to send 99% of the donated money to the project.  It is possible to sponsor a child, so that he or she gets continued support, or make a one-time donation.

[[Bram Moolenaar]], author of the text editor [[Vim (text editor)|Vim]], is the founder and treasurer of ICCF Holland. While Vim is [[free software]], Moolenaar encourages users to contribute to ICCF and help children in Uganda. A message to this effect appears every time Vim is started without a command or filename.

===Early history===
The oldest traces of human existence in what is now Liechtenstein date back to the [[Middle Paleolithic]] era.&lt;ref name = Early&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20100419174957/http://www.swissworld.org/en/history/prehistory_to_romans/prehistoric_times/ History]. swissworld.org. Retrieved 27 June 2009&lt;/ref&gt; [[Neolithic]] farming settlements were initially founded in the valleys around 5300 BCE.

The [[Hallstatt culture|Hallstatt]] and [[La Tène culture]]s flourished during the late [[Iron Age]], from around 450 BCE—possibly under some influence of both the [[Ancient Greek|Greek]] and [[Etruscan civilization|Etruscan]] civilisations. One of the most important tribal groups in the Alpine region were the [[Helvetii]]. In 58 BCE, at the [[Battle of Bibracte]], [[Julius Caesar]] defeated the Alpine tribes, therefore bringing the region under close control of the [[Roman Republic]]. By 15 BCE, [[Tiberius]]—destined to be the second Roman emperor—with his brother, [[Nero Claudius Drusus|Drusus]], conquered the entirety of the Alpine area. Liechtenstein was then integrated into the [[Roman province]] of [[Raetia]]. The area was maintained by the Roman military, who also maintained large legionary camps at [[Bregenz|Brigantium]] (Austria), near [[Lake Constance]], and at [[Maienfeld|Magia]] (Swiss). A [[Roman road]] which ran through the territory was also created and maintained by these groups. In 259/60 Brigantium was destroyed by the [[Alemanni]], a [[Germanic people]] who settled in the area in around 450 CE.

In the [[Early Middle Ages]], the Alemanni settled the eastern [[Swiss plateau]] by the 5th century and the [[valleys of the Alps]] by the end of the 8th century, with Liechtenstein located at the eastern edge of Alemannia. In the 6th century, the entire region became part of the [[Frankish Empire]] following [[Clovis I]]'s victory over the Alemanni at [[Tolbiac]] in 504.&lt;ref name = Nationsencyclopedia&gt;[http://www.nationsencyclopedia.com/Europe/Switzerland-HISTORY.html Switzerland history] Nationsencyclopedia.com. Retrieved 27 November 2009&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = Nationsonline&gt;[http://www.nationsonline.org/oneworld/History/Switzerland-history.htm History of Switzerland] Nationsonline.org. Retrieved 27 November 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

The area that later became Liechtenstein remained under Frankish hegemony ([[Merovingians|Merovingian]] and [[Carolingian Empire|Carolingian]] dynasties), until the empire was divided by the [[Treaty of Verdun]] in 843&amp;nbsp;CE, following the death of [[Charlemagne]].&lt;ref name = Early/&gt; The territory of present-day Liechtenstein was under the possession of [[East Francia]]. It would later be reunified with [[Middle Francia]] under the [[Holy Roman Empire]], around 1000 CE.&lt;ref name = Early/&gt; Until about 1100, the predominant language of the area was [[Romansh language|Romansch]], but thereafter [[German language|German]] began to gain ground in the territory. In 1300, an Alemannic population—the Walsers, who originated in [[Valais]]—entered the region and settled. The mountain village of [[Triesenberg]] still preserves features of [[Walser German|Walser dialect]] into the present century.&lt;ref&gt;P. Christiaan Klieger, ''The Microstates of Europe: Designer Nations in a Post-Modern World'' (2014), p. 41&lt;/ref&gt;

===Foundation of a dynasty===
By 1200, dominions across the Alpine plateau were controlled by the Houses of [[House of Savoy|Savoy]], [[Zähringer]], [[Habsburg]], and [[House of Kyburg|Kyburg]]. Other regions were accorded the [[Imperial immediacy]] that granted the empire direct control over the mountain passes. When the Kyburg dynasty fell in 1264, the Habsburgs under [[Rudolph I of Habsburg|King Rudolph I]] (Holy Roman Emperor in 1273) extended their territory to the eastern Alpine plateau that included the territory of Liechtenstein.&lt;ref name = Nationsencyclopedia/&gt; This region was [[Feoffment|enfeoffed]] to the [[Hohenems|Counts of Hohenems]] until the sale to the [[Liechtenstein dynasty]] in 1699.

In 1396 Vaduz (the southern region of Liechtenstein) was raised to the status of "imperial immediacy" and as such made subject to the Holy Roman Emperor alone.&lt;ref name="Eccardt 2005 176"&gt;{{cite book|last=Eccardt|first=Thomas|date=2005|title=Secrets of the Seven Smallest States of Europe|isbn=978-0-7818-1032-6|publisher=Hippocrene Books|pages=176}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The family, from which the principality takes its name, originally came from [[Liechtenstein Castle]] in Lower Austria which they had possessed from at least 1140 until the 13th century (and again from 1807 onwards). The Liechtensteins acquired land, predominantly in [[Moravia]], [[Lower Austria]], [[Silesia]], and [[Duchy of Styria|Styria]]. As these territories were all held in [[Fee (feudal tenure)|feudal tenure]] from more senior feudal lords, particularly various branches of the [[House of Habsburg|Habsburgs]], the Liechtenstein dynasty was unable to meet a primary requirement to qualify for a seat in the Imperial diet ([[parliament]]), the [[Imperial Diet (Holy Roman Empire)|''Reichstag'']]. Even though several Liechtenstein princes served several Habsburg rulers as close advisers, without any territory held directly from the Imperial throne, they held little power in the Holy Roman Empire.

For this reason, the family sought to acquire lands that would be classed as ''unmittelbar'' (immediate) or held without any intermediate feudal tenure, directly from the [[Holy Roman Emperor]]. During the early 17th century [[Karl I, Prince of Liechtenstein|Karl I of Liechtenstein]] was made a ''Fürst'' (prince) by the Holy Roman Emperor [[Matthias, Holy Roman Emperor|Matthias]] after siding with him in a political battle. [[Hans-Adam I, Prince of Liechtenstein|Hans-Adam I]] was allowed to purchase the minuscule ''Herrschaft'' ("Lordship") of [[Schellenberg]] and county of [[Vaduz]] (in 1699 and 1712 respectively) from the Hohenems. Tiny Schellenberg and Vaduz had exactly the political status required: no feudal lord other than their [[count|comital]] sovereign and the [[Suzerainty|suzerain]] Emperor.

===Principality===
{{more references|date=January 2017}}
On 23 January 1719&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.liechtenstein.li/en/country-and-people/300-years-principality-of-liechtenstein//|website=liechtenstein.li|publisher=Liechtenstein Marketing|accessdate=1 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;, after the lands had been purchased, [[Charles VI, Holy Roman Emperor]], decreed that Vaduz and Schellenberg were united and elevated the newly formed territory to the dignity of ''Fürstentum'' (''[[principality]]'') with the name "Liechtenstein" in honour of "[his] true servant, [[Anton Florian, Prince of Liechtenstein|Anton Florian of Liechtenstein]]". It was on this date that Liechtenstein became a sovereign member state of the [[Holy Roman Empire]]. It is a testament to the pure political expediency of the purchase that the Princes of Liechtenstein never visited their new principality for almost 100 years.

By the early 19th century, as a result of the [[Napoleonic Wars]] in Europe, the Holy Roman Empire came under the effective control of France, following the crushing defeat at [[Battle of Austerlitz|Austerlitz]] by [[Napoleon]] in 1805. Emperor [[Francis II, Holy Roman Emperor|Francis II]] abdicated, ending more than 960 years of feudal government. Napoleon reorganized much of the Empire into the [[Confederation of the Rhine]]. This political restructuring had broad consequences for Liechtenstein: the historical imperial, legal, and political institutions had been dissolved. The state ceased to owe an obligation to any feudal lord beyond its borders.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=History, creation of Liechtenstein|url=https://www.liechtenstein.li/en/country-and-people/history/creation-of-liechtenstein/|website=liechtenstein.li|publisher=Liechtenstein Marketing|accessdate=1 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Modern publications generally attribute Liechtenstein's sovereignty to these events. Its prince ceased to owe an obligation to any [[Suzerainty|suzerain]]. From 25 July 1806, when the [[Confederation of the Rhine]] was founded, the Prince of Liechtenstein was a member, in fact, a vassal, of its hegemon, styled ''protector'', the French Emperor Napoleon I, until the dissolution of the confederation on 19 October 1813.

Soon afterward, Liechtenstein joined the [[German Confederation]] (20 June 1815{{spaced ndash}}24 August 1866), which was presided over by the [[Emperor of Austria]].

In 1818, [[Johann I Joseph, Prince of Liechtenstein|Prince Johann I]] granted the territory a limited constitution. In that same year [[Aloys II, Prince of Liechtenstein|Prince Aloys]] became the first member of the House of Liechtenstein to set foot in the principality that bore their name. The next visit would not occur until 1842.

Developments during the 19th century included:
* 1836, the first factory, for making ceramics, was opened.
* 1861, the Savings and Loans Bank was founded along with the first cotton-weaving mill.
* 1868, the Liechtenstein Army was disbanded for financial reasons.
* 1872, a railway line between Switzerland and the Austro-Hungarian Empire was constructed through Liechtenstein.
* 1886, two bridges over the Rhine to Switzerland were built.

===20th century===
Until the end of [[World War I]], Liechtenstein was closely tied first to the [[Austrian Empire]] and later to [[Austria-Hungary]]; the ruling princes continued to derive much of their wealth from estates in the Habsburg territories, and they spent much of their time at their two palaces in Vienna. The economic devastation caused by this war forced the country to conclude a [[customs union|customs]] and [[monetary union]] with its other neighbour, Switzerland.

At the time of the dissolution of the Austro-Hungarian Empire, it was argued that Liechtenstein, as a fief of the Holy Roman Empire, was no longer bound to the emerging independent state of [[First Austrian Republic|Austria]], since the latter did not consider itself as the legal successor to the empire. This is partly contradicted{{Original research inline|date=June 2016}} by the Liechtenstein perception that the dethroned Austro-Hungarian Emperor still maintained an abstract heritage of the Holy Roman Empire.

[[File:Franz I von Liechtenstein.jpg|thumb|[[Franz I, Prince of Liechtenstein]] from 1929 to 1938]]

In 1929, 75-year-old [[Franz I, Prince of Liechtenstein|Prince Franz I]] succeeded to the throne. Franz had just married [[Elisabeth von Gutmann]], a wealthy woman from Vienna whose father was a Jewish businessman from Moravia. Although Liechtenstein had no official Nazi party, a Nazi sympathy movement arose within its National Union party.
Local Liechtenstein Nazis identified Elisabeth as their Jewish "problem".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title= Liechtenstein: Nazi Pressure? |date=11 April 1938 |url= http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,759431,00.html |work=Time |location= New York |accessdate=26 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In March 1938, just after the [[Anschluss|annexation of Austria by Nazi Germany]], Prince Franz named as regent his 31-year-old grandnephew and heir-presumptive, [[Franz Joseph II, Prince of Liechtenstein|Prince Franz Joseph]]. Franz died in July that year, and Franz Joseph succeeded to the throne. Franz Joseph II first moved to Liechtenstein in 1938, a few days after Austria's annexation.&lt;ref name="Eccardt 2005 176"/&gt;

During [[World War II]], Liechtenstein remained officially neutral, looking to neighbouring Switzerland for assistance and guidance, while family treasures from dynastic lands and possessions in [[Bohemia]], [[Moravia]], and [[Silesia]] were taken to Liechtenstein for safekeeping. At the close of the conflict, [[Czechoslovakia]] and [[Poland]], acting to seize what they considered to be German possessions, expropriated the entirety of the Liechtenstein dynasty's properties in those three regions. The expropriations (subject to [[Foreign relations of Liechtenstein#International dispute with the Czech Republic and Slovakia|modern legal dispute]] at the [[International Court of Justice]]) included over {{convert|1600|km2|sqmi|0|abbr=on}} of agricultural and forest land (most notably the UNESCO listed [[Lednice–Valtice Cultural Landscape]]), and several family castles and palaces.

In 2005 it was revealed that Jewish labourers from the [[Strasshof an der Nordbahn|Strasshof]] [[concentration camp]], provided by the ''[[Schutzstaffel|SS]]'', had worked on estates in [[Austria]] owned by Liechtenstein's Princely House.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url= http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/4443809.stm |title=Nazi crimes taint Liechtenstein |work=BBC News |date=14 April 2005 |accessdate=3 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Citizens of Liechtenstein were forbidden to enter Czechoslovakia during the [[Cold War]]. More recently the diplomatic conflict revolving around the controversial post-war [[Beneš decrees]] resulted in Liechtenstein not sharing international relations with the [[Czech Republic]] or [[Slovakia]]. Diplomatic relations were established between Liechtenstein and the Czech Republic on 13 July 2009,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=Liechtenstein and the Czech Republic establish diplomatic relations |url=http://88.82.102.51/fileadmin/_pm.liechtenstein.li/en/090713_PM_Beziehungen_CzFl_en.pdf |format=PDF |publisher=Government Spokesperson’s Office, the Principality of Liechtenstein |date=13 July 2009 |accessdate=6 August 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110511222932/http://88.82.102.51/fileadmin/_pm.liechtenstein.li/en/090713_PM_Beziehungen_CzFl_en.pdf |archivedate=11 May 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=Navázání diplomatických styků České republiky s Knížectvím Lichtenštejnsko|url=http://www.mzv.cz/jnp/cz/udalosti_a_media/prohlaseni_a_stanoviska/archiv_prohlaseni_a_stanovisek/archiv_2009/x2009_07_13_lilchtejnstejnsko_navazani_diplomatickych_vztahu.html|publisher=Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Czech Republic|language=Czech|trans-title=Establishment of diplomatic relations with the Czech Republic and the Principality of Liechtenstein|date=13 July 2009|accessdate=28 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://macedoniaonline.eu/content/view/7526/1/ |title=MINA Breaking News – Decades later, Liechtenstein and Czechs establish diplomatic ties |publisher=Macedoniaonline.eu |date=15 July 2009 |accessdate=6 June 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; and with Slovakia on 9 December 2009.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=Liechtenstein and the Slovak Republic establish diplomatic relations |url=http://88.82.102.51/fileadmin/_pm.liechtenstein.li/en/091209_Beziehungen_SKFL_en.pdf |format=PDF |publisher=Government Spokesperson’s Office, the Principality of Liechtenstein |date=9 December 2009 |accessdate=22 December 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110511222920/http://88.82.102.51/fileadmin/_pm.liechtenstein.li/en/091209_Beziehungen_SKFL_en.pdf |archivedate=11 May 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Financial centre===
Liechtenstein was in dire financial straits following the end of the war in Europe. The Liechtenstein dynasty often resorted to selling family artistic treasures, including the portrait ''[[Ginevra de' Benci]]'' by [[Leonardo da Vinci]], which was purchased by the [[National Gallery of Art]] of the [[United States]] in 1967 for {{US$|link=yes}}5 million (${{Inflation|US|5|1967}} million in {{Inflation-year|US}} dollars), then a record price for a painting.

However, by the late 1970s, it used its low [[corporate tax]] rates to draw many companies to the country, becoming one of the wealthiest countries in the world.

{{As of|2008|September}} the [[Prince of Liechtenstein]] is the world's eighth [[List of the richest royals|wealthiest monarch]] with an estimated wealth of {{US$}}3.5 billion.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |author=D.

Liechtenstein has a constitutional monarch as Head of State, and an elected parliament which enacts the law. It is also a [[direct democracy]], where voters can propose and enact constitutional amendments and legislation independent of the legislature. The [[Constitution of Liechtenstein]] was [[Liechtenstein constitutional referendum, 2003|adopted in March 2003]], replacing the previous 1921 constitution which had established Liechtenstein as a constitutional monarchy headed by the reigning prince of the Princely House of Liechtenstein. A parliamentary system had been established, although the reigning Prince retained substantial political authority.

The reigning Prince is the head of state and represents Liechtenstein in its international relations (although Switzerland has taken responsibility for much of Liechtenstein's diplomatic relations). The Prince may veto laws adopted by parliament. The Prince can call [[referendum|referenda]], propose new legislation, and dissolve parliament, although dissolution of parliament may be subject to a referendum.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/country_profiles/1066002.stm#leaders "Country profile: Liechtenstein – Leaders"]. BBC News. 6 December 2006. Retrieved 29 December 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

Executive authority is vested in a collegiate government comprising the head of government (prime minister) and four government councilors (ministers). The head of government and the other ministers are appointed by the Prince upon the proposal and concurrence of parliament, thus reflecting the partisan balance of parliament. The constitution stipulates that at least two members of the government be chosen from each of the two regions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.liechtenstein.li/en/eliechtenstein_main_sites/portal_fuerstentum_liechtenstein/fl-staat-staat/fl-staat-regierung.htm |title=Principality of Liechtenstein – Government |accessdate=11 January 2010 |deadurl=unfit |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20070807124607/http://www.liechtenstein.li/en/eliechtenstein_main_sites/portal_fuerstentum_liechtenstein/fl-staat-staat/fl-staat-regierung.htm |archivedate=7 August 2007 }}. Retrieved 11 January 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; The members of the government are collectively and individually responsible to parliament; parliament may ask the Prince to remove an individual minister or the entire government.

Legislative authority is vested in the unicameral [[Landtag of Liechtenstein|Landtag]] made up of 25 members elected for maximum four-year terms according to a proportional representation formula.

Parliament proposes and approves a government, which is formally appointed by the Prince. Parliament may also pass votes of no confidence in the entire government or individual members.

Parliament elects from among its members a "Landesausschuss" (National Committee) made up of the president of the parliament and four additional members. The National Committee is charged with performing parliamentary oversight functions. Parliament can call for referenda on proposed legislation. Parliament shares the authority to propose new legislation with the Prince and with the number of citizens required for an initiative referendum.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.liechtenstein.li/en/eliechtenstein_main_sites/portal_fuerstentum_liechtenstein/fl-staat-staat/fl-staat-landtag/fl-staat-organisation.htm |title=Principality of Liechtenstein website – Parliamentary Organization |accessdate=11 January 2010 |deadurl=unfit |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20041011183440/http://www.liechtenstein.li/en/eliechtenstein_main_sites/portal_fuerstentum_liechtenstein/fl-staat-staat/fl-staat-landtag/fl-staat-organisation.htm |archivedate=11 October 2004 }}.

===New constitution===
In a [[Liechtenstein constitutional referendum, 2003|national referendum]] in March 2003, nearly two-thirds of the electorate voted in support of Hans-Adam II's proposed new constitution to replace the 1921 version. The proposed constitution was criticised by many, including the [[Council of Europe]], as expanding the powers of the monarchy (continuing the power to veto any law, and allowing the Prince to dismiss the government or any minister). The Prince threatened that if the constitution failed, he would, among other things, convert some of the royal property for commercial use and move to Austria.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/2853991.stm "Liechtenstein Prince wins powers"].

==Geography==
{{Main article|Geography of Liechtenstein}}
[[File:Rhein bei Balzers - Blick auf Gonzen.JPG|thumb|The [[Rhine]]: border between Liechtenstein and Switzerland (view towards the [[Swiss Alps]])]]

Liechtenstein is situated in the Upper [[Rhine]] valley of the European [[Alps]] and is bordered to the east by Austria, and to the south and west by Switzerland. The entire western border of Liechtenstein is formed by the Rhine. Measured south to north the country is about {{convert|24|km|0|abbr=on}} long. Its highest point, the [[Grauspitz]], is {{convert|2599|m|0|abbr=on}}. Despite its Alpine location, prevailing southerly winds make the climate of Liechtenstein comparatively mild. In winter, the mountain slopes are well suited to [[winter sport]]s.

New [[surveying|surveys]] using more accurate measurements of the country's borders in 2006 have set its area at {{convert|160|km2|3|abbr=on}}, with borders of {{convert|77.9|km|1|abbr=on}}.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/16381664/ "Tiny Liechtenstein gets a little bigger"], 29 December 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, it was discovered in 2006 that Liechtenstein's borders are {{convert|1.9|km|1|abbr=on}} longer than previously thought.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/6215825.stm "Liechtenstein redraws Europe map"]. ''BBC News''. 28 December 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

Liechtenstein is one of only two [[doubly landlocked country|doubly landlocked countries]] in the world&lt;ref name="LiechCIA"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/ls.html|title=Liechtenstein |website=The World Factbook |publisher=Central Intelligence Agency |access-date=3 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;—being a landlocked country wholly surrounded by other landlocked countries (the other is [[Uzbekistan]]). Liechtenstein is the [[List of countries and dependencies by area|sixth-smallest]] independent nation in the world by land area.

The principality of Liechtenstein is [[Municipalities of Liechtenstein|divided into 11 communes]] called ''Gemeinden'' (singular ''Gemeinde''). The ''Gemeinden'' mostly consist of only a single town or village. Five of them ([[Eschen]], [[Gamprin]], [[Mauren]], [[Ruggell]], and [[Schellenberg]]) fall within the electoral district ''Unterland'' (the lower county), and the remainder ([[Balzers]], [[Planken]], [[Schaan]], [[Triesen]], [[Triesenberg]], and [[Vaduz]]) within ''Oberland'' (the upper county).

==Economy==
{{Main article|Economy of Liechtenstein}}
[[File:Vaduz Zentrum.jpg|thumb|Looking southward at Vaduz city centre]]

Despite its limited natural resources, Liechtenstein is one of the few countries in the world with more registered companies than citizens; it has developed a prosperous, highly industrialized free-enterprise economy and boasts a financial service sector as well as a living standard that compares favourably with those of the urban areas of Liechtenstein's much larger European neighbours.

Liechtenstein participates in a [[customs union]] with Switzerland and employs the [[Swiss franc]] as the national currency. The country imports about 85% of its energy. Liechtenstein has been a member of the [[European Economic Area]] (an organization serving as a bridge between the [[European Free Trade Association]] (EFTA) and the [[European Union]]) since May 1995. The government is working to harmonize its economic policies with those of an integrated Europe. In 2008, the unemployment rate stood at 1.5%. Currently, there is only one hospital in Liechtenstein, the Liechtensteinisches Landesspital in Vaduz. As of 2014 the [[CIA World Factbook]] estimated the [[gross domestic product]] (GDP) on a [[purchasing power parity]] basis to be $4.978 billion. As of 2009 the estimate per capita was $139,100, which is the highest listed for the world.&lt;ref name="LiechCIA"/&gt;

Industries include electronics, textiles, precision instruments, metal manufacturing, power tools, anchor bolts, calculators, pharmaceuticals, and food products. Its most recognizable international company and largest employer is [[Hilti]], a manufacturer of [[Nail gun|direct fastening systems]] and other high-end [[power tool]]s. Many cultivated fields and small farms are found both in the south (Oberland, ''upper land'') and north (Unterland, ''lower land''). Liechtenstein produces [[wheat]], [[barley]], [[corn]], [[potato]]es, dairy products, livestock, and [[Liechtenstein wine|wine]]. Tourism accounts for a large portion of the country's economy.

===Taxation===
[[File:Grenze Liechtenstein, Balzers.jpg|thumb|left|Since 1923, there has been no [[border control]] between Liechtenstein and [[Switzerland]].]]

The government of Liechtenstein taxes personal, business income, and principal (wealth). The basic rate of [[Income tax#Personal|personal income tax]] is 1.2%. When combined with the additional income tax imposed by the communes, the combined income tax rate is 17.82%.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nationsencyclopedia.com/Europe/Liechtenstein-TAXATION.html Encyclopedia of the Nations]. Nationsencyclopedia.com. Retrieved 24 December 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; An additional income tax of 4.3% is levied on all employees under the country's [[social security]] programme. This rate is higher for the self-employed, up to a maximum of 11%, making the maximum income tax rate about 29% in total. The basic [[wealth tax|tax rate on wealth]] is 0.06% per annum, and the combined total rate is 0.89%. The tax rate on corporate profits is 12.5%.&lt;ref name=LiechCIA/&gt;

Liechtenstein's [[gift tax|gift]] and [[Inheritance tax|estate taxes]] vary depending on the relationship the recipient has to the giver and the amount of the inheritance. The tax ranges between 0.5% and 0.75% for spouses and children and 18% to 27% for non-related recipients. The estate tax is progressive.

Liechtenstein has previously received significant revenues from ''Stiftungen'' ("foundations"), which are financial entities created to hide the true owner of nonresident foreigners' financial holdings. The foundation is registered in the name of a Liechtensteiner, often a lawyer. This set of laws used to make Liechtenstein a popular [[tax haven]] for extremely wealthy individuals and businesses attempting to avoid or [[tax evasion|evade taxes]] in their home countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2013-05-02/billionaire-tax-haven-liechtenstein-loses-on-bank-reforms|title=Billionaire Tax Haven Liechtenstein Loses on Bank Reforms|website=Bloomberg.com|accessdate=3 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; In recent years, Liechtenstein has displayed a stronger determination to prosecute international money-launderers and has worked to promote the country's image as a legitimate finance center. In February 2008, the country's [[LGT Group|LGT Bank]] was implicated in a [[2008 Liechtenstein tax affair|tax-fraud scandal in Germany]], which strained the ruling family's relationship with the German government. Crown Prince Alois has accused the German government of trafficking in stolen goods, referring to its $7.3 million purchase of private banking information offered by a former employee of LGT Group.&lt;ref&gt;Wiesmann, Gerrit (23 February 2008).

The [[2008 Liechtenstein tax affair]] is a series of tax investigations in numerous countries whose governments suspect that some of their citizens have evaded tax obligations by using banks and trusts in Liechtenstein; the affair broke open with the biggest complex of investigations ever initiated for [[tax evasion]] in the [[Germany|Federal Republic of Germany]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |title=Skandal gigantischen Ausmaßes |url= //www.sueddeutsche.de/wirtschaft/steuerhinterziehung-skandal-gigantischen-ausmasses-1.272873 |work=Süddeutsche Zeitung |location= Munich |language=German |date=17 May 2010 |accessdate=17 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was also seen as an attempt to put pressure on Liechtenstein, then one of the remaining [[FATF blacklist|uncooperative tax havens]]—along with [[Andorra]] and [[Monaco]]—as identified by the Paris-based [[Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development]] in 2007.&lt;ref name="wsj0219"&gt;{{Cite news |last=Esterl |first=Mike |author2=Simpson, Glenn R. |authorlink2=Glenn R.

In August 2009, the British government department [[HM Revenue &amp; Customs]] agreed with Liechtenstein to start exchanging information.

In October 2015, the European Union and Liechtenstein signed a tax agreement to ensure the automatic exchange of financial information in case of tax disputes. The collection of data started in 2016, and is another step to bring the principality in line with other European countries with regard to its taxation of private individuals and corporate assets.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release |url= http://www.consilium.europa.eu/en/press/press-releases/2015/10/28-eu-liechtenstein-deal-exchange-tax-data/ |title=EU and Liechtenstein sign deal on automatic exchange of tax data |publisher=European Council |accessdate=15 August 2017 |date=28 October 2015 |location= Brussels}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Demographics==
{{Main article|Demographics of Liechtenstein|Religion in Liechtenstein}}
Population-wise, Liechtenstein is the fourth smallest country of Europe; only [[Vatican City]], [[San Marino]], and [[Monaco]] have fewer residents. Its population is primarily [[Alemannic German|Alemannic]]-speaking, although one third is foreign-born, primarily [[German language|German]] speakers from [[Germany]], [[Austria]], and [[Switzerland]], along with other Swiss, [[Italians]], and [[Turkish people|Turks]]. Foreign-born people make up two-thirds of the country's workforce.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.wto.org/english/tratop_e/tpr_e/s280_sum_e.pdf|title= WT/TPR/S/280 • Switzerland and Liechtenstein|publisher=WTO|accessdate=26 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Liechtensteiners have an average life expectancy at birth of 80.31 years, subdividing as male: 76.86 years, female: 83.77 years (2011 est.). The infant mortality rate is 4.64 deaths per 1,000 live births, according to recent estimates.

=== Languages ===
The official language is German; most speak an [[Alemannic German|Alemannic]] [[dialect]] of German that is highly divergent from [[Standard German]] but closely related to those dialects spoken in neighbouring regions such as Switzerland and [[Vorarlberg]], Austria. In [[Triesenberg]], a [[Walser German]] dialect promoted by the municipality is spoken. However, [[Swiss Standard German]] is understood and spoken by most people within the country.

{{Culture of Liechtenstein}}
[[File:Kunstmuseum Liechtenstein (Walti).jpg|thumb|City-centre with Kunstmuseum ([[Kunstmuseum Liechtenstein|Liechtenstein Art Museum]])]]
[[File:Liechtensteinisches Landes Museum 1.jpg|thumb|[[Liechtenstein National Museum]]]]

As a result of its small size, Liechtenstein has been strongly affected by external cultural influences, most notably those originating in the southern German-speaking areas of Europe, including Austria, Baden-Wurttemberg, Bavaria, Switzerland, and specifically [[German Tyrol|Tirol]] and [[Vorarlberg]]. The "Historical Society of the Principality of Liechtenstein" plays a role in preserving the culture and history of the country.

The largest museum is the [[Kunstmuseum Liechtenstein]], an international museum of modern and contemporary art with an important international art collection. The building by the Swiss architects Morger, Degelo, and Kerez is a landmark in Vaduz. It was completed in November 2000 and forms a "black box" of tinted concrete and black basalt stone. The museum collection is also the national art collection of Liechtenstein.

The other important museum is the [[Liechtenstein National Museum]] (''Liechtensteinisches Landesmuseum'') showing permanent exhibition on the cultural and natural history of Liechtenstein as well as special exhibitions. There is also a stamp museum, ski museum, and a 500-year-old Rural Lifestyle Museum.

The [[Liechtenstein State Library]] is the library that has [[legal deposit]] for all books published in the country.

The most famous historical sites are [[Vaduz Castle]], [[Gutenberg Castle]], the Red House and the ruins of Schellenberg.

The Private Art Collection of the Prince of Liechtenstein, one of the world's leading private art collections, is shown at the [[Liechtenstein Museum]] in [[Vienna]].

On the country's national holiday all subjects are invited to the castle of the head of state. A significant portion of the population attends the national celebration at the castle where speeches are made and complimentary beer is served.&lt;ref name=Letzing&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/liechtenstein-gets-even-smaller-1397700444 |title=Liechtenstein Gets Even Smaller
 |last=Letzing |first=John |date=16 April 2014 |website=The Wall Street Journal |access-date=21 June 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Music and theatre are an important part of the culture. There are numerous music organizations such as the Liechtenstein Musical Company, the annual Guitar Days, and the International Josef Gabriel Rheinberger Society, which play in two main theatres.

==Media==
The primary [[internet service provider]] and [[mobile network operator]] of Liechtenstein is Telecom Liechtenstein, located in Schaan. There is only one television channel in the country, the private channel [[1FLTV]] created in 2008. At the moment, 1FLTV is not a member of the [[European Broadcasting Union]]. L-Radio, which was established in 2004, serves as Liechtenstein's radio station and is based in Triesen. L-Radio has a listener base of 50,000 and began as "air Radio Liechtenstein" on 15 October 1938. Liechtenstein also has two major [[newspaper]]s; ''[[Liechtensteiner Volksblatt]]'' and ''[[Liechtensteiner Vaterland]]''. The primary [[multimedia]] company in Liechtenstein is [[ManaMedia]], located in Vaduz.

[[Amateur radio]] is a hobby of some nationals and visitors. However, unlike virtually every other sovereign nation, Liechtenstein does not have its own [[ITU prefix]]. It uses Switzerland's callsign prefixes (typically "HB") followed by a zero.

==Sports==
{{See also|Rugby union in Liechtenstein}}
[[File:Marco Büchel.jpg|thumb|left|upright|[[Marco Büchel]], the first Liechtensteiner alpine skier to compete at six [[Winter Olympic Games|Winter Olympics]]]]
Liechtenstein [[Association football|football]] teams play in the Swiss football leagues. The [[Liechtenstein Football Cup]] allows access for one Liechtenstein team each year to the [[UEFA Europa League]]; [[FC Vaduz]], a team playing in the [[Swiss Challenge League]], the second division in Swiss football, is the most successful team in the Cup, and scored their greatest success in the [[1996–97 UEFA Cup Winners' Cup|European Cup Winners' Cup in 1996]] when they drew with and defeated the [[Latvia]]n team [[FK Jelgava|FC Universitate Riga]] by 1–1 and 4–2, to go on to a lucrative fixture against [[Paris Saint-Germain F.C.]], which they lost 0–3 and 0–4.

The [[Liechtenstein national football team]] is regarded as an easy target for any team drawn against them; this was the basis for a book about Liechtenstein's unsuccessful qualifying campaign for the [[2002 FIFA World Cup|2002 World Cup]] by British author, [[Charlie Connelly]]. In one surprising week during autumn 2004, however, the team managed a 2–2 draw with [[Portugal national football team|Portugal]], who only a few months earlier had been the losing finalists in the [[UEFA Euro 2004|European Championships]]. Four days later, the Liechtenstein team traveled to Luxembourg, where they defeated [[Luxembourg national football team|the home team]] 4–0 in a [[2006 FIFA World Cup|2006 World Cup]] qualifying match. In the qualification stage of the European Championship 2008, Liechtenstein beat Latvia 1–0, a result which prompted the resignation of the Latvian coach. They went on to beat Iceland 3–0 on 17 October 2007, which is considered one of the most dramatic losses of the Icelandic national football team. On 7 September 2010, they came within seconds of a 1–1 draw against [[Scotland national football team|Scotland]] in Glasgow, having led 1–0 earlier in the second half, but Liechtenstein lost 2–1 thanks to a goal by [[Stephen McManus]] in the 97th minute. On 3 June 2011, Liechtenstein defeated [[Lithuania national football team|Lithuania]] 2–0. On 15 November 2014, Liechtenstein defeated [[Moldova national football team|Moldova]] 0–1 with [[Franz Burgmeier]]'s late free kick goal in [[Chișinău]].

As an [[Alps|alpine]] country, the main sporting opportunity for Liechtensteiners to excel is in winter sports such as [[Downhill (ski competition)|downhill skiing]]: the country's single ski area is [[Malbun]]. [[Hanni Wenzel]] won two gold medals and one silver medal in the 1980 [[Winter Olympic Games|Winter Olympics]] (she won bronze in 1976), her brother [[Andreas Wenzel|Andreas]] won one silver medal in 1980 and one bronze medal in 1984 in the [[Giant slalom skiing|giant slalom]] event, and her daughter [[Tina Weirather]] won a bronze medal in 2018 in the [[Super-G]]. With ten medals overall (all in alpine skiing), Liechtenstein has won more Olympic medals per capita than any other nation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=Per Capita Olympic Medal Table|url=http://users.skynet.be/hermandw/olymp/reloly.html|accessdate=24 January 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is the smallest nation to win a medal in any Olympics, Winter or Summer, and the only nation to win a medal in the Winter Games but not in the Summer Games. Other notable skiers from Liechtenstein are [[Marco Büchel]], [[Willi Frommelt]], [[Paul Frommelt]] and [[Ursula Konzett]]. Liechtenstein is also the home country of [[Stephanie Vogt]], a professional women's [[tennis]] player.

===Youth===
[[Liechtenstein national football team|Liechtenstein]] competes in the Switzerland U16 Cup Tournament, which offers young players an opportunity to play against top football clubs.

==Security and defence==
The [[Law enforcement in Liechtenstein|Liechtenstein National Police]] is responsible for keeping order within the country. It consists of 87 field officers and 38 civilian staff, totaling 125 employees. All officers are equipped with [[small arms]]. The country has one of the world's lowest [[Crime statistics|crime rate]]s. Liechtenstein's prison holds few, if any, inmates, and those with sentences over two years are transferred to Austrian jurisdiction. The Liechtenstein National Police maintains a trilateral treaty with Austria and Switzerland that enables close cross-border cooperation among the police forces of the three countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.liechtenstein.li/en/pdf-fl-staat-aussenpolitik-finanzplatz-facts_and_figures_engl.pdf |title=''Liechtenstein – facts and figures'' |accessdate=2 May 2010 |deadurl=unfit |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060107214519/http://www.liechtenstein.li/en/pdf-fl-staat-aussenpolitik-finanzplatz-facts_and_figures_engl.pdf |archivedate=7 January 2006 }}. Office for Foreign Affairs of Liechtenstein&lt;/ref&gt;

Liechtenstein follows a policy of [[Neutrality (international relations)|neutrality]] and is one of the few [[List of countries without armed forces|countries in the world that maintain no military]]. The army was abolished soon after the [[Austro-Prussian War of 1866]], in which Liechtenstein fielded an army of 80 men, although they were not involved in any fighting. The demise of the [[German Confederation]] in that war freed Liechtenstein from its international obligation to maintain an army, and parliament seized this opportunity and refused to provide funding for one. The Prince objected, as such a move would leave the country defenceless, but relented on 12 February 1868 and disbanded the force. The last soldier to serve under the colors of Liechtenstein died in 1939 at age 95.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Beattie|first=David|title=Liechtenstein: A Modern History|location=London|publisher=[[I.B. Tauris]]|year=2004|page=30|isbn=978-1-85043-459-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;!-- Switzerland is NOT responsible for Liechtenstein's defence and no such bilateral agreement exists. Please read the relevant e-mails by the Embassies of Switzerland and Liechtenstein in Washington D.C. for further information. These are available on the article's talk page: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Liechtenstein/Defence_Responsibility_Emails

During the 1980s the Swiss army fired off shells during an exercise and mistakenly burned a patch of forest inside Liechtenstein. The incident was said to have been resolved "over a case of white wine".&lt;ref name=Letzing/&gt;

In March 2007, a 170-person Swiss infantry unit got lost during a training exercise and inadvertently crossed {{convert|1.5|km|1|abbr=in}} into Liechtenstein. The accidental invasion ended when the unit realized their mistake and turned back.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|last=CBC News|title=Not-so-precise Swiss army unit mistakenly invades Liechtenstein|url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/world/story/2007/03/02/swissinvade.html|accessdate=18 September 2011|newspaper=CBC News|date=2 March 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Swiss army later informed Liechtenstein of the incursion and offered official apologies,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|last=Hamilton|first=Lindsay|title=Whoops!

This page lists diplomatic missions accredited to [[Liechtenstein]]. The Principality of Liechtenstein is, along with the Vatican City, one of only two sovereign states in the world without a resident embassy or consulate located within its territory. Eighty-six countries have ambassadors accredited to Liechtenstein, with most being resident in [[Bern]], [[Vienna]] or [[Berlin]].

Abram grew up in [[Wangi Wangi, New South Wales]], Australia. She completed her secondary education at Toronto High School.

Abram completed a Bachelor of Science (Advanced) degree at the University of Sydney in 2000. This degree included an honours project studying the [[Holocene]] climate history of the [[Ryukyu Islands]], Japan. She graduated from her undergraduate studies with the [[University Medal]].

Abram then commenced her PhD through the Research School of Earth Sciences at the [[Australian National University]] in 2004. During this time she was the recipient of the John Conrad Jaeger Scholarship.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Jaeger Scholarship|url=http://cmbe-cpms.anu.edu.au/study/scholarships-prizes/scholarships/john-conrad-jaeger-earth-sciences-scholarship/|accessdate=2014-08-18|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140617064907/http://cmbe-cpms.anu.edu.au/study/scholarships-prizes/scholarships/john-conrad-jaeger-earth-sciences-scholarship|archivedate=2014-06-17|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Her postgraduate studies earned her the Mervyn and Kaitalin Paterson Fellowship&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Paterson Fellowship|url=http://students.anu.edu.au/scholarships/gr/off/int/paterson-fellowship.php|accessdate=2014-08-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the Robert Hill Memorial Prize for excellence in scientific research, communication and outreach.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Robert Hill Memorial Prize|url=http://students.anu.edu.au/graduation/prizes/cpms/robert-hill-memorial-prize.php|accessdate=2014-08-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Research==
Abram’s research expertise spans Antarctic and tropical climate systems. She uses [[Porites]] corals, [[Speleothem]] samples from caves and [[Ice core]] samples to reconstruct climate changes in the past to provide a crucial long-term perspective on recent and projected future climate changes. Abram's publication record includes first-author papers across the scientific journals of [[Science (journal)|''Science'']], [[Nature (journal)|''Nature'']], ''[[Nature Geoscience]]'', and ''[[Nature Climate Change]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Nerilie Abram|url=https://scholar.google.com.au/citations?user=yWwLiyYAAAAJ&amp;hl=en |website=Google Scholar|accessdate=2014-08-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Between 2004 and 2011 Abram was an ice core scientist with the [[British Antarctic Survey]]. Here, she was part of the team that drilled the [[James Ross Island]] ice core in 2008. Dr Abram’s discoveries from this project included that the [[Antarctic Peninsula]] is warming very rapidly,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=15000 years of Antarctic Peninsula climate history|url = http://www.sciencepoles.org/interview/15000-years-of-antarctic-peninsula-climate-history|accessdate = 18 August 2014|website =Science Poles}}&lt;/ref&gt; resulting in a 10-fold increase summer ice melt in that area of Antarctica.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=What is happening to Antarctica's ice?|url = http://theconversation.com/explainer-what-is-happening-to-antarcticas-ice-13684|accessdate = 18 August 2014|website = the Conversation}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Abram was part of the chemical analysis team of the NEEM ice core project in Northern [[Greenland]] in 2010 which sought to retrieve ice from the [[Eemian]] inter-glacial period to discover what Earth would be like under the effects of global warming.&lt;ref name="NEEM"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://neem.dk/about_neem/ |title=About NEEM |accessdate=14 August 2014 |publisher=[[University of Copenhagen]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In the summer of 2013/14 Abram was also a member of the international team that drilled the Aurora Basin ice core in East Antarctica.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.antarctica.gov.au/science/climate-processes-and-change/antarctic-palaeoclimate/aurora-basin/people-in-the-field/nerilie-abram-driller-and-ice-core-chemist|title = Australian Antarctic Division "People in the field" Profile.|date =28 October 2013 |accessdate = 14 August 2014|website =Australian Government Department of the Environment |publisher =Australian Government |last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2014 Abram demonstrated that the southward shift in westerly winds caused by greenhouse gas emissions has moved these winds to their most southward position in at least the last 1,000 years causing a marked reduction in rainfall in southern Australia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Research shows Antarctica may be the reason for SA dry climate|url=http://www.abc.net.au/am/content/2014/s4002380.htm|accessdate=15 August 2014|publisher=[[ABC News (Australia)|ABC News]]|date=14 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Science communication==

Abram is a dedicated science communicator, and her work has been covered by international print, online, radio and television media outlets. She has also been interviewed for documentaries including the BBC ''[[Men of Rock]]''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Studying Ice Cores, The Big Freeze|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/p011smzs|accessdate=18 August 2014|publisher=BBC2}}&lt;/ref&gt; series hosted by [[Iain Stewart (geologist)|Iain Stewart]], and for the [[Natural History Museum, London|Natural History Museum]] exhibition of [[Robert Falcon Scott|Robert Scott]]’s final expedition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Studying Ice Cores in Antarctica|url= https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VjTsj-fi-p0&amp;feature=youtu.be|accessdate=18 August 2014|publisher=Natural History Museum}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2013, Abram wrote an invited essay on Antarctic ice melt and sea level rise for ''The Curious Country'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Curious Country|url=http://press.anu.edu.au/titles/the-curious-country/|accessdate=18 August 2014|publisher=[[ANU Press]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; a book about the importance of Australian science published for the [[Office of the Chief Scientist (Australia)]]. This work was later selected for republication in the anthology of Best Australian Science Writing 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Best Australian Science Writing 2014|url=https://www.newsouthbooks.com.au/books/best-australian-science-writing-2014/|accessdate=30 June 2016|publisher=New South}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Abram is a mother of three children and has a strong interest in encouraging other women in scientific careers.

'''Proxeny''' or '''proxenia''' ({{lang-el|προξενία}}) in [[ancient Greece]] was an arrangement whereby a citizen (chosen by the city) hosted foreign ambassadors at his own expense, in return for honorary titles from the state. The citizen was called '''proxenos''' (πρόξενος; plural: ''proxenoi'' or ''proxeni'', "instead of a foreigner") or proxeinos (πρόξεινος). The proxeny [[decree]]s, which amount to letters of patent and resolutions of appreciation were issued by one state to a citizen of another for service as proxenos, a kind of [[honorary consul]] looking after the interests of the other state's citizens. A cliché phrase is ''euergetes (benefactor) and proxenos'' (πρόξεινος τε ειη και ευεργέτης).

A proxenos would use whatever influence he had in his own city to promote policies of friendship or alliance with the city he voluntarily represented. For example, [[Cimon]] was [[Sparta]]'s proxenos at [[Athens]] and during his period of prominence in Athenian politics, previous to the outbreak of the [[First Peloponnesian War]], he strongly advocated a policy of cooperation between the two states. Cimon was known to be so fond of Sparta that he named one of his sons [[Lacedaimonius|Lacedaemonius]].&lt;ref&gt;''The History of the Peloponnesian War'' by [[Thucydides]], Donald Lateiner, [[Richard Crawley]], page 33. {{ISBN|0-486-43762-0}} &lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Who's who in the Greek world'' by John Hazel, page 56. {{ISBN|0-415-12497-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;
 
Being another city's proxenos did not preclude taking part in war against that city, should it break out – since the proxenos' ultimate loyalty was to his own city. However, a proxenos would naturally try his best to prevent such a war from breaking out and to compose whatever differences were threatening to cause it. And once peace negotiations were on the way, a proxenos' contacts and goodwill in the enemy city could be profitably used by his city.

The position of proxenos for a particular city was often hereditary in a particular family.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4171">'''Robert P. Descharnes''' (January 1, 1926—February 15, 2014) was a French photographer, filmmaker, and author. He served as [[Salvador Dali]]'s secretary and, after the painter's death, administrator of his copyright. He is the author of several books on Dali.

==Biography==
Descharnes was born in [[Nevers]] on January 1, 1926. In 1950, he met Dali on a ship while he was the photographer. The two formed a close bond, and collaborated on the experimental film ''L'Aventure prodigieuse de la dentellière et du rhinocéros'', which was never released. He became Dali's personal secretary in 1981, and rescued him from a fire at his apartment in 1984.&lt;ref name=lefigaro/&gt; Descharnes collected over 60,000 negatives of Dali's daily life, a fraction of which Descharnes infrequenty exhibited in art museums.&lt;ref name=artdaily&gt;{{cite news|first=Christina|last=Ayala|url=http://artdaily.com/news/68335/French-artist--Salvador-Dali-s-secretary-and-biographer-Robert-Descharnes--dies-at-age-88#.UxpUjD9dWAg|title=French artist, Salvador Dali's secretary and biographer Robert Descharnes, dies at age 88|newspaper=ArtDaily|date=February 21, 2014|accessdate=March 7, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For over 40 years, he fought to protect's Dali's legacy from forgeries and fakes. He wrote several reference books on the man's life and work. Descharnes was named a Chevalier of the [[Ordre des Arts et des Lettres]] in 2011. He died at the age of 88 at his home in [[Indre-et-Loire]] on February 18, 2014.&lt;ref name=lefigaro&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.lefigaro.fr/culture/2014/02/18/03004-20140218ARTFIG00206-deces-de-robert-descharnes-l-homme-qui-avait-sauve-salvador-dal.php|title=Décès de Robert Descharnes, l'homme qui avait sauvé Salvador Dalí|newspaper=[[Le Figaro]]|date=February 18, 2014|accessdate=March 7, 2014|language=French}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Descharnes is regarded by some Dali experts as a controversial figure. His claims regarding the authenticity of some of Dali's late works have been questioned, as Ian Gibson notes in his definitive biography of the painter,''[[The Shameful Life of Salvador Dali]].'' Of far greater concern was Descharnes's role in persuading the elderly, infirm painter to transfer his copyright, in 1986, for a period of 20 years to a company managed by Descharnes. Gibson writes, "The contract was prepared by [the Madrid lawyer] Miguel Domenech, who has said that at the time Dali, he and [Dali's friend, Antoni] Pitxot were under 'tremendous pressure' from a now power-hungry Descharnes. ... Even when he was well, Dali had never shown any interest in contracts, or any understanding of their small print. ... It is difficult to believe, therefore, that...he could have grasped its exact nature or its potential consequences. The painter, moreover, was in very poor physical condition at this time."&lt;ref&gt;Gibson, Ian (1998) ''The Shameful Life of Salvador Dali,'' pps. 669-670.&lt;/ref&gt; Gibson, who calls Descharnes "a very controversial figure in Spain," notes in a 1997 episode of the TV show "Omnibus," about Dali and his work, that "many of Dali's associates are still unhappy about this situation," by which he means the circumstances surrounding the signing of the contract in which Dali assigned his copyright to Descharnes's company.&lt;ref&gt;''Omnibus,'' https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2mMz9JXbCOs.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''STV Group plc''', previously known as '''Scottish Television plc''' and '''Scottish Media Group plc''', is a Scottish media company. It is a constituent of the [[FTSE Fledgling Index]]. Originally formed as [[Scottish Television]], the [[ITV (TV network)|ITV]] licence holder for central Scotland, the company changed its name to Scottish Media Group in 1996 and acquired the licence holder for Northern Scotland, [[Grampian Television]], in 1997. The Scottish and Grampian channels were rebranded as [[STV (TV channel)|STV]] in 2006.

==History==
[[File:SMG PLC New.PNG|thumb|Right|SMG's last logo before rebrand]]
[[Scottish Television]] began broadcasting in August 1957. The company changed its name to Scottish Media Group in 1996 when it acquired Caledonian Publishing, owners of Glasgow-based newspapers ''[[The Herald (Glasgow)|The Herald]]'' and ''[[Evening Times]]'' (both of which have since been sold). It went on to acquire the [[ITV (TV network)|ITV]] licence holder for Northern Scotland, [[Grampian Television]] in June 1997.&lt;ref&gt;Scottish Media seeks to loosen ties with ITV. Eric Reguly.

By September an agreement had been reached to acquire Guardian Media Group's 15% stake in [[GMTV]] for £20 million, but both [[Carlton Television|Carlton]] and Granada objected to the deal.&lt;ref name="broadcastnow.co.uk"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.broadcastnow.co.uk/smg-bid-for-gmtv-stake-could-be-blocked/1219881.article |title=SMG bid for GMTV stake could be blocked |publisher=Broadcast |date=1999-09-10 |accessdate=2013-06-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Guardian Media Group eventually sold its stake for £18m in January 2000, but STV Group only acquired 5% with the remaining 10% going to Carlton and Granada, resulting in each of STV Group, Carlton, Granada and Disney holding 25% of GMTV.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/media/2000/sep/05/16 |title=GMTV |work=The Guardian |date=5 September 2000 |accessdate=10 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.broadcastnow.co.uk/trio-share-gmtv-stake/1187804.article |title=Trio share GMTV stake |publisher=Broadcast |date=2000-01-07 |accessdate=2013-06-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In September 1999, the company acquired a 37.4% stake in [[Heart of Midlothian F.C.]] for £8 million. A few days later the company unveiled its interim results with its pre-tax profits up 2 per cent to £24 million on a turnover of £111.2 million.&lt;ref name="broadcastnow.co.uk"/&gt;

[[Living TV Group|Flextech]] owner Telewest sold its 16.9% stake in STV Group to an investment bank for £45 million as part of their plan to raise funds to help clear off debt.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thisismoney.co.uk/money/news/article-1532419/Telewest-sells-SMG-stake-for-16345m.html |title=Telewest sells SMG stake for £45m |publisher=This is Money |date=2002-11-06 |accessdate=2013-06-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Milmo |first=Dan |url=https://www.theguardian.com/media/2002/nov/06/smg.citynews |title=Telewest offloads SMG stake |work=The Guardian |date=6 November 2002 |accessdate=10 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Throughout 2003/2004 rumours appeared about the company being broken up, with its ITV interests being sold off in an attempt to wipe out its £380m debt and boost its balance sheet. However, the group instead sold the Herald newspapers and its stake in Scottish Radio Holdings. In late 2003 Northern Ireland's [[UTV Media|UTV]], in partnership with venture capital group [[3i]] and Scottish Radio Holdings, sought to acquire SMG for £400 million, but they withdrew the offer as they felt the share price was too high.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P2-24724574.html |title=UTV on the acquisition trail after SMG failure |publisher=HighBeam Research |date=2004-03-16 |accessdate=2013-06-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.brandrepublic.com/news/204970/Ulster-TV-plots-400m-bid-buy-Scottish-Media-Group/ |title=Ulster TV plots £400m bid to buy Scottish Media Group |publisher=Brand Republic |date=2004-03-15 |accessdate=2013-06-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Andrew Flanagan unexpectedly resigned as chief executive in July 2006. Although he helped create the company since 1998, his spell in charge will be remembered by many in the television industry as a period which saw a dramatic decline in the amount of programmes made by the company for transmission within Scotland alone.&lt;ref name="BBC 18Jul2006" /&gt;

Rob Woodward became the new chief executive in 2007, and started a major reconstruction of the group by instigating a sell-off of poorly performing assets,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Hobson |first=Ben |url=http://www.stockopedia.co.uk/content/rob-woodward-of-scottish-media-group-stv-talks-to-stockopedia-47078/ |title=Rob Woodward Of Scottish Media Group STV Talks To Stockopedia |publisher=Stockopedia |date=2010-09-01 |accessdate=2013-06-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; starting with Primesight being sold for £62m to a private equity firm.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

Further major changes occurred when STV Group sold Virgin Radio to a group led by [[The Times of India]] on 31 May 2008.&lt;ref name="Virgin Radio sold to Indian group"&gt;{{cite news
  | title =  Virgin Radio sold to Indian group

In June 2008, SMG plc announced plans to change its name to ''STV Group plc''. The company said the proposed name change was to highlight its renewed focus on television, encompassing the [[Scottish Television|STV Central]] and [[Grampian Television|STV North]] franchises, as well as the company's TV production business.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news
  | title = SMG reborn as STV Group

| last=Fitzsimmons}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This name change was approved at an [[extraordinary general meeting]] in September 2008, along with a new deal resulting in Pearl &amp; Dean handling advertising for [[Showcase Cinemas]], which meant that the Pearl &amp; Dean titles would appear in just under half of UK cinema sites.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/scotland/7631338.stm |title=Scottish media group changes name |publisher=BBC News |date=23 September 2008 |accessdate=2013-06-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; The new ''STV Group'' branding was introduced on 1 October 2008.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

By 2010 the group had sold off all non-television assets, including selling cinema advertising company Pearl &amp; Dean for £1 to Image Ltd, a newly formed company backed by [[Empire Cinemas]] director Thomas Anderson, with STV still recouping £9.1m from the business due to a 2010 payment from [[Vue Cinemas]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/scotland/8634158.stm |title=STV to sell Pearl &amp; Dean for £1 |publisher=BBC News |date=21 April 2010 |accessdate=2013-06-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; This action helped reduce the group's debt and allowed it to concentrate on its core television businesses. As a result of this, STV Group largely reverted to its Scottish Television plc days, but with the addition of the former Grampian Television and Ginger Productions businesses (the latter retained from the Ginger Media acquisition).

===Merger proposals===
In September 2006, STV Group (then SMG) officially rejected a merger offer from Northern Irish ITV franchise holder [[UTV Media|UTV]]. The merger approach would have given SMG shareholders a 52% stake in the combined company. The Scottish group said its board had examined a revised merger proposal from UTV, but did not believe it reflected the value of the company.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

In 2006 [[ITV plc]] considered making an offer for STV Group, according to ''[[The Mail on Sunday]]''. The newspaper quoted an ITV source as saying John Cresswell, acting chief executive at the broadcaster, was most interested in the group's television franchises, but that any deal would have been for the whole group. SMG warned that its 2006 profit would be materially behind expectations, sending its shares down more than a quarter in value to a 15-year low.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

On 10 January 2007, SMG and UTV agreed details of a merger, including a revised share split between the two. UTV would own 54% of the group, with SMG owning the remaining 46%.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

This merger was finally rejected at the end of February 2007, and a new board and management team were introduced at SMG shortly afterwards.

===Relationship with ITV plc===
STV Group plc has had a turbulent relationship with [[ITV plc]] and both [[Carlton Television|Carlton]] and [[ITV Granada|Granada]], the predecessor companies that merged to create it. ITV plc owns the ITV franchises in [[England]], [[Northern Ireland]], [[Wales]], Southern Scotland ([[Dumfries and Galloway]] and the [[Scottish Borders]]), the [[Isle of Man]] and the [[Channel Islands]]. ITV plc also operates a number of digital channels and websites under the ITV brand. The company threatened to take legal action over the use of the name 'ITV' because it is the name of the Independent Television network, which [[Scottish Television|STV Central]] and [[Grampian Television|STV North]] are both part of. One of the problems facing the group is that ITV is the senior partner when it comes to its two TV stations, since London-based ITV effectively controls most of the scheduling and is also responsible for selling STV's advertising airtime.{{citation needed|date=December 2014}}

In September 2009, ITV plc announced it was to launch legal proceedings against STV for a claimed unpaid debt of £38 million from network programming contributions, following STV's practice of dropping a number of network programmes on the STV franchise. At the same time, STV claimed it was also following procedures against ITV plc, for up to £40 million owed to STV under its advertising sales agreements.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

==Television==

===STV===
{{main|STV (TV channel)}}
STV Group plc owns two Scottish ITV licences: [[Scottish Television]], which covers Central Scotland, and [[Grampian Television]], covering Northern Scotland.  On 2 March 2006, it was announced that Scottish Television would revert to using its former brand name of "STV", which it previously used from the start of colour broadcasting in 1969 until 30 August 1985, and which the station was still informally known as in parts of Scotland. Scottish Television became known as ''STV Central''. At the same time, Grampian Television would also become known as ''STV North'', with the one main identity of ''STV'' serving the two licences. The rebrand took place on 30 May 2006.

====Other channels====
The former SMG plc ran its own digital channel, [[S2 (TV channel)|S2]], throughout the Scottish and Grampian ITV regions. S2, which aired on the Digital Terrestrial platform, was launched on 30 April 1999 and was replaced by [[ITV2]] just over two years later – as part of a deal with [[ITV Digital]] – on 27 July 2001.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

[[Sky Scottish]] was a satellite television channel operating on the analogue Sky TV service between 1 November 1996 and 31 May 1998. The service was a joint venture between [[BSkyB|British Sky Broadcasting]] and SMG. It initially broadcast between 6.00pm and 8.00pm. The channel was closed due to poor ratings.{{citation needed|date=December 2014}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="41632">{{Time zones of Europe}}
'''European Summer Time''' is the variation of standard clock time that is applied in most [[Europe]]an countries (not including [[Iceland]], [[Georgia (country)|Georgia]], [[Azerbaijan]], [[Belarus]], [[Turkey]] and [[Russia]]) in the period between spring and autumn, during which clocks are advanced by one hour from the time observed in the rest of the year, in order to make the most efficient use of seasonal daylight. It corresponds to the notion and practice of [[daylight saving time]] to be found in many other parts of the world.

European Summer Time begins at 01:00 [[UTC]]/[[Western European Time|WET]] (02:00 [[Central European Time|CET]], 03:00 [[Eastern European Time|EET]]) on the last Sunday in March and ends at 01:00 UTC (02:00 [[Western European Summer Time|WEST]], 03:00 [[Central European Summer Time|CEST]], 04:00 [[Eastern European Summer Time|EEST]]) on the last Sunday in October each year; i.e. the change is made at the same absolute time across all time zones. [[European Union]] Directive 2000/84/EC makes summer time mandatory for EU member states (except overseas territories), though a proposal to repeal this directive and require member states to observe (their own choice of) an unchanging time year-round, is currently going through the legislative process.

Summer Time lasts, depending upon the calendar year, for either 30 or 31 weeks of the year.

==History==
Summer Time was first introduced during the [[First World War]]. However, most countries discontinued the practice after the war. It was then restarted in various countries during the [[Second World War]] and its immediate aftermath. Again it was widely cancelled by the 1950s, but reintroduced in isolated cases until the late 1960s, when the energy crisis began to prompt policymakers to reintroduce Summer Time across the continent. It has remained in place in most European countries since then.

Historically the countries of Europe had different practices for observing Summer Time, but this hindered coordination of transport, communications and movements. Starting in 1981 the [[European Commission]] began issuing [[European Union directive|directives]] requiring member states to legislate harmonised start and end dates for Summer Time.&lt;ref name=Report&gt;{{cite web|title=Communication from the commission to the Council, the European Parliament and the European economic and social committee under Article 5 of Directive 2000/84/EC on summer time arrangements|url=http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=COM:2007:0739:FIN:EN:NOT|publisher=European Commission|accessdate=8 March 2015|date=23 November 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since 1981 each directive has specified a transition time of 01:00 UTC and a start date of the last Sunday in March, but the end dates have differed. Successive Directives laid down two dates for the end: one on the last Sunday in September applied by the continental Member States, and the other on the fourth Sunday in October for the United Kingdom and Ireland.&lt;ref name=Report/&gt; In 1996 the end date was changed to the fourth Sunday in October for all countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=European Commission - Mobility and Transport: Summertime|url=http://ec.europa.eu/transport/summertime_en.htm|date=24 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1998 the end date was changed to the last Sunday in October; this happened to be the same as the previous rule for 1996 and 1997.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=History of legal time in Britain|author=Joseph Myers|url=http://www.srcf.ucam.org/~jsm28/british-time/|date=21 January 2007|accessdate=24 March 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ninth directive, Directive 2000/84/EC, currently (2018) in force, specifies this rule.&lt;ref name=EC&gt;{{cite web|url=http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=CELEX:32000L0084:EN:NOT|title=Directive 2000/84/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 19 January 2001 on summer time arrangement}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Future==
There were proposals in 2015 and 2016 from members of the [[European Parliament]] to abolish summer time observance, but the [[European Commission]] did not at that time put forward proposals to be considered, saying it had not found conclusive evidence in favour of a change, and [[Member State of the European Union|member states]] were divided. It did however note that a cost would be incurred if harmonisation between member states' summer time rules was lost.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://epthinktank.eu/2016/03/24/summertime-changing-the-clocks/|title=Summertime: changing the clocks|author=|date=24 March 2016|website=epthinktank.eu}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.timeanddate.com/news/time/eu-dst-discussions.html|title=EU Politicians Speak Up to Remove DST|author=|date=|website=www.timeanddate.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2017 the Finnish and Lithuanian parliaments both voted in favour of proposals calling on the EU to reconsider daylight saving, with similar criticism from Poland and Sweden. The European Commission at the time was reviewing the practice.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.euractiv.com/section/health-consumers/news/finland-wants-eu-to-give-up-daylight-saving-time/ Finland wants EU to give up daylight saving time], Euractiv 27/10/17&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.euractiv.com/section/health-consumers/news/lithuania-hopes-to-kill-daylight-savings-time/ Lithuania hopes to kill daylight savings time], Euractiv 22/11/17&lt;/ref&gt;

On 8 February 2018, the European Parliament voted to ask the European Commission to re-evaluate DST in Europe.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.timeanddate.com/news/time/eu-parliament-abolish-dst.html|title=EU Parliament Votes to Re-Evaluate DST in Europe|author=|date=|website=www.timeanddate.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; After a web survey showing high support for not switching clocks twice annually,&lt;ref&gt;[http://europa.eu/rapid/press-release_IP-18-5302_en.htm Summertime Consultation: 84% want Europe to stop changing the clock]&lt;/ref&gt; on 12 September 2018 the European Commission decided to propose that an end be put to seasonal clock changes (repealing Directive 2000/84/EC).&lt;ref&gt;[http://europa.eu/rapid/press-release_MEMO-18-5641_en.htm State of the Union 2018: Q&amp;A on the Commission's proposal to put an end to seasonal clock changes] European Commission − Press Release (Strasbourg, 12 September 2018)&lt;/ref&gt; In order for this to be valid, the [[European Union legislative procedure]] must be followed, mainly that the [[Council of the European Union]] and the European Parliament must both approve the proposal.

Under the proposal, member countries are expected to decide by 31 March 2019 whether they wish to retain their current winter time year round{{snd}} in which case they would change clocks for the last time in October 2019, or their current summer time{{snd}} in which case the last change would be in March 2019. This is however considered a fairly tight timescale by many.&lt;ref name=resistjuncker/&gt;&lt;ref name=bbc-Clock-ticking/&gt; The [[Internet Assigned Numbers Authority]], which coordinates changes to the [[tz database|time zone database]] used by most computers and smartphones, notes that "With less than a year's notice there is a good chance that some computer-based clocks will operate incorrectly after the change, due to delays in propagating updates to software and data."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Sources for time zone and daylight saving time data |url=https://data.iana.org/time-zones/tz-link.html#changes |website=data.iana.org |publisher=IANA |accessdate=24 October 2018 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; The airline industry points out the complexity of revising all airline schedules, particularly in terms of ensuring slot availability on flights outside the EU, and recommends keeping the status quo or deferring the change until at least 2021.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Joint industry position on Summertime Arrangements |url=https://www.iata.org/policy/slots/Documents/Position%20papers/Airlines-Position-on-European-Summertime%20Arrangements.pdf |website=www.iata.org |publisher=IATA |accessdate=28 October 2018 |language=en-us}}&lt;/ref&gt; An informal meeting of EU transport ministers on 29 October 2018 suggested that many member states would not support the "unrealistic" timetable and that implementation could be pushed back to 2021.&lt;ref name=bbc-Clock-ticking&gt;{{cite news |title=Clock is ticking on EU daylight saving |url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-46017347 |accessdate=30 October 2018 |work=BBC News |date=29 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Discussions have shown support for year-round "winter time" in e.g. Denmark, the Netherlands (UTC+1) and Finland (UTC+2) while permanent summer time was supported in Portugal (UTC+1), Poland (UTC+2) and Cyprus (UTC+3).&lt;ref name=resistjuncker&gt;[https://www.politico.eu/article/countries-resist-jean-claude-juncker-daylight-saving-clock-change-plan/ Countries resist Juncker’s clock change plan]&lt;/ref&gt; Spanish opinion is split on the matter; the mainland largely favours shifting to UTC, while the [[Balearic islands]] would prefer to remain on UTC+1 and the [[Canary islands]] on UTC-1.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Why Spain should turn back the clock for the last time |url=https://www.thelocal.es/20181024/why-spain-should-turn-back-the-clock-for-the-last-time |accessdate=29 October 2018 |work=The Local |date=24 October 2018 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; The United Kingdom is due to [[Brexit|leave the EU]] before the reform becomes effective; any new EU directive would apply during the transition period (if any) but thereafter the UK could choose to make its own arrangements.&lt;ref name="bbc-20181002" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=House of Lords - Subsidiarity Assessment:discontinuing seasonal changes of time - European Union Committee |url=https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld201719/ldselect/ldeucom/200/20003.htm |website=publications.parliament.uk |accessdate=5 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; If the UK were thus to continue observing summer/winter time, [[Northern Ireland]] would have a one-hour time difference for half the year either with the rest of [[Ireland]] or with the rest of the UK, adding a further complication to the [[Irish border question]].&lt;ref name=norniron&gt;[https://www.politico.eu/article/eu-daylight-saving-switch-could-leave-n-ireland-out-of-step-with-rest-of-uk/ EU daylight saving switch could leave Northern Ireland out of step with rest of UK]&lt;/ref&gt; The Irish government is to hold a public consultation on the EU proposal;&lt;ref name="bbc-20181002"&gt;{{cite news |last1=Campbell |first1=John |title=Dublin and Belfast in separate time zones? |url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-45725516 |accessdate=30 October 2018 |work=BBC News |date=2 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;
{{As of|September 2018|lc=yes}}, the UK Government "has no plans" to end daylight saving.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.belfasttelegraph.co.uk/news/northern-ireland/northern-ireland-wont-change-time-zone-to-suit-the-eu-say-unionists-37271919.html Northern Ireland won't change time zone to suit the EU, say unionists] {{snd}} [[Belfast Telegraph]], 1 September 2018&lt;/ref&gt;

A formula which can be used to calculate the '''beginning''' of European Summer Time is:

'''Sunday (31 − ((((5 × ''y'') ÷ 4) + 4) mod 7)) March at 01:00 UTC'''

The corresponding formula for the '''end''' of European Summer Time is:

'''Sunday (31 − ((((5 × ''y'') ÷ 4) + 1) mod 7)) October at 01:00 UTC'''

where ''y'' is the year, and ''a'' [[Modulo operation|mod]] ''b'' is ''b'' times the fractional part of ''a''/''b''. These formulae are valid until 2099.&lt;ref&gt;Attributed to Robert H. van Gent. [http://webexhibits.org/daylightsaving/i.html "Daylight Saving Time: About this exhibit"]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Double Summer Time==
"Double Summer Time" (two hours ahead of local winter time) has been observed on some occasions, notably in 1921, 1941-45 and 1947. See:
* [[British Double Summer Time]] ([[UTC+02:00]])
* [[Central European Midsummer Time]] ([[UTC+03:00]])
* [[Moscow Midsummer Time]] ([[UTC+05:00]])

==Countries not switching to and from summer time==
There are four countries that do not use summer time, but keep the same time all year.

Some may be thought of as using "permanent" summer time, since they use time zones allocated to regions further east than themselves. Belarus explicitly decided to stay permanently on (what it formerly called) summer time after 2011.

Spain, France, Belgium, and the Netherlands may also be thought of as observing "summer time" throughout the winter, and "double-summer time" during summer, because of their position to the west of the central European time zone.

*{{flag|Belarus}} switched to summer time in Spring 2011 and did not switch back, and is now observing [[UTC+03:00|UTC+3]] all year round. The midpoint of Belarus has longitude 28°E (corresponds to UTC+1.8).
*{{flag|Iceland}} observes UTC all year round despite being at longitudes (13°W-24°W) which would indicate [[UTC-01:00|UTC-1]]. Iceland's high latitude (the Reykjavík region, home to nearly two-thirds of the country's people, is at [[64th parallel north|64°N]]) means that sunset and sunrise times change by many hours over the year, and the effect of changing the clock by one hour would, in comparison, be small.
*{{flag|Russia}} used "permanent summer time" from 2011 to 2014. In October 2014 Russia changed permanently back to standard time ([[UTC+03:00]] in the country's west, including Moscow), setting the clocks back one hour at the same time as other European countries did.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Russia set to turn back the clocks with daylight-saving time shift|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/jul/01/russia-state-duma-daylight-saving-time-summer|accessdate=25 October 2014|publisher=The Guardian|date=1 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*{{flag|Turkey}} decided to stop daylight saving time in September 2016, but to stay in on [[UTC+03:00|UTC+3]] throughout the year rather than switching back to its original time [[UTC+02:00|UTC+2]].

==Local observations==
In most of Europe, the word ''Summer'' is added to the name of each European [[time zone]] during this period: thus, in the [[UTC+01:00]] time zone, [[Central European Time]] becomes [[Central European Summer Time]] ([[UTC+02:00]]).

==={{flagu|Austria}}===
[[Austria]] used summer time in 1916–1918, 1920, 1940–1948 (as part of [[Nazi Germany]] between 1940–1945) and since 1980. 

===={{flagu|Austria-Hungary}}====
[[Austria-Hungary]] used summer time during World War I in 1916, 1917 and 1918, in line with the [[German Empire]].

==={{flagu|Bulgaria}}===
Summer time was introduced in Bulgaria in 1979 by a regulation of the Bulgarian Council of Ministers. Bulgaria observes the European Union rules for summer time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.novinite.com/view_news.php?id=113965|title=Bulgaria Turns Clocks to Daylight Saving Time March 28 - Novinite.com - Sofia News Agency|date=|website=novinite.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==={{flagu|Czech Republic}}===
In the [[Kingdom of Bohemia]] summer time was used for three seasons during World War I, from 1916 to 1918, while part of the [[Austria-Hungary|Austro-Hungarian Empire]]. 

During World War II, when the [[Protectorate of Bohemia and Moravia]] became a [[de facto]] part of [[Nazi Germany]], summer time was used from 1940. In 1940/1941 and 1941/1942, the summer time was kept continuously even during the winter. 

[[Czech Republic]] continued to use summer time after the [[dissolution of Czechoslovakia]] in 1993.

===={{flagu|Czechoslovakia}}====
[[Czechoslovakia]] used summer time from 1945 to 1949 and from 1979 to 1992. In winter 1946/1947 (from 1 December to 23 February), [[winter time (Czechoslovakia)|winter time]] (CET−01:00) was used.

==={{flagu|Denmark}}===
Summer time has been observed in [[Denmark]] since 1980. A national association against summer time (Landsforeningen mod Sommertid) exists,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://ikkesommertid.info/|title=Landsforeningen mod Sommertid|accessdate=2007-10-27|language=Danish}}&lt;/ref&gt; which celebrated the EU commission preliminary decision in August 2018.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bt.dk/samfund/formand-jubler-over-eu-udmelding-sa-skal-champagnen-flyde-i-stride-stromme |title=Formand jubler over EU-udmelding: 'Så skal champagnen flyde i stride strømme'] (translation: The chairman is delighted with EU announcement: "The champagne will flow in steady flow") |date=31 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==={{flagu|Estonia}}===
In [[Estonia]] summer time was not used in 1989–1996 and 2000–2001. It was used under Soviet rule in 1981–1988.

==={{flagu|Faroe Islands}}===
The Faroe Islands observes summer time since 1981.&lt;ref&gt;[[tz database]]&lt;/ref&gt; The islands has never been part of the EU, so the decision to observe summer time was its own.

==={{flagu|Finland}}===
In Finland, summer time has been used on a regular basis since 1981.

[[Initiative#Finland|A citizens' initiative]] to abolish daylight saving time was signed by 70,000 Finnish citizens. It was presented to the Finnish parliament in June 2017.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://yle.fi/uutiset/osasto/news/citizens_initiative_to_dump_daylight_saving_time_heads_to_finnish_lawmakers/9657273|title=Citizens' initiative to dump Daylight Saving Time heads to Finnish lawmakers|author=|date=|website=yle.fi}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-finland-eu-daylightsaving/finland-wants-eu-to-give-up-daylight-saving-time-idUSKBN1CV2OE|title=Finland wants EU to give up daylight saving time|first=Reuters|last=Editorial|date=|website=reuters.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==={{flagu|France}} and {{flagu|Monaco}}===
From 1923 until the Second World War, France and Monaco observed summer time from the last Saturday in March until the first Saturday in October. During the Second World War France also observed summer time. However, after the war the practice was abandoned (since the country changed time zones instituting ''de facto'' permanent summer time). In 1975, summer time was reimplemented because of the [[1973 oil crisis|oil crisis]].&lt;ref name=Poulle&gt;{{cite journal|last=Poulle|first=Yvonne|title=La France à l'heure allemande|journal=Bibliothèque de l'école des chartes|year=1999|volume=157|issue=2|pages=493–502|language=French|url=http://www.persee.fr/articleAsPDF/bec_0373-6237_1999_num_157_2_450989/article_bec_0373-6237_1999_num_157_2_450989.pdf|accessdate=11 January 2012|doi=10.3406/bec.1999.450989}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since GMT (now UTC) is France's "natural" time zone, its use of UTC+1 in winter can be seen as a form of [[daylight saving time]], while its use of Central European Summer Time (UTC+2) in summer can be seen as a form of "double summer time".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Thorsen|first=Steffen|title=France and Spain kicks into "Double Summer Time"|url=http://www.timeanddate.com/news/time/france-spain-summer-time.html|publisher=Time and Date.com|accessdate=11 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

France and Monaco follow EU rules regarding the start and end times and dates for summer time.

==={{flagu|Germany}}===
Summer time was first introduced during [[World War I]] by the [[German Empire]] from 1916 to 1918. After the end of the war and the proclamation of the [[Weimar Republic]] in November 1918, summer time ceased to be observed. Summer time was reintroduced in 1940, during [[World War II]], to try to save energy for the [[war economy]]. After the defeat of Germany, summer time was retained by the occupation powers. In 1945, [[Berlin]] and the Soviet Occupation Zone even observed [[Central European Midsummer Time]] (''Mitteleuropäische Hochsommerzeit'', ''MEHSZ''; [[UTC+03:00]]): in 1947, all of Germany switched to midsummer time from 11 May to 29 June. After the [[Federal Republic of Germany|Federal Republic]] (West Germany) and the [[German Democratic Republic]] (East Germany) were established in 1949, summer time again ceased to be observed in 1950.

In 1978, [[West Germany]] decided to reintroduce summer time, following the example set by several neighbouring states in the aftermath of the [[1973 oil crisis]]. However, it only came into effect in 1980, after West and [[East Germany]] reached an agreement to observe summer time simultaneously from the last Sunday in March (02:00 CET) to the last Sunday in September (03:00 CEST). Thus both German states observed the same time until the [[German reunification]] in 1990, after which the reunified Germany retained the laws and thus also the Time Act (''Zeitgesetz'') of West Germany.

After 1980, West and East Germany; since 1991 reunified Germany: [[Central European Summer Time]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ptb.de/cms/en/fachabteilungen/abt4/fb-44/ag-441/realisation-of-legal-time-in-germany/dst-and-midsummer-dst-in-germany-until-1979.html DST and midsummer DST in Germany until 1979], Physikalisch-Technische Bundesanstalt. (2010)&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Büsingen am Hochrhein]], a small exclave, entirely surrounded by Swiss territory, did not implement summer time in 1980 but observed the same time as Switzerland; thus there was a one hour time difference between this village and the rest of [[Germany]]. The zone [[Europe/Busingen]]{{clarify|date=August 2018}} was created in the 2013a release of the [[tz database]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://mm.icann.org/pipermail/tz-announce/2013-March/000009.html |title=tzcode2013a and tzdata2013a available |first=Paul |last=Eggert |publisher=[http://mm.icann.org/pipermail/tz-announce/ tz-announce] |date=2013-03-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; because since the [[Unix time]] epoch in 1970, Büsingen am Hochrhein has shared clocks with [[Zurich]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://article.gmane.org/gmane.comp.time.tz/4765 |title=New zone for DE, split from Europe/Berlin |first=Arthur David |last=Olson |publisher=gmane.comp.time.tz |date=2012-03-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Germany follows the [[European Union|EU]] rules regarding the start and end times and dates for summer time.

==={{flagu|Greenland}}===
{{see also|Daylight saving time in the Americas#Greenland}}
[[Greenland]] observes Summer Time simultaneously with Europe. Summer Time thus begins at 00:00 [[Time in Denmark|East Greenland Time]] on Sunday, and 22:00 West Greenland Time on Saturday, and ends at 01:00 EGST on Sunday and 23:00 WGST on Saturday. It was introduced in 1980 when Greenland was legally a part of Denmark without local rule. The most other EU [[Overseas countries and territories]] do not observe summer time. Exceptions, based on company decisions, are the northeastern coast around [[Danmarkshavn]] (UTC year-round) for [[Thule Air Base]] (which follows [[Atlantic time zone|Atlantic Time]] and observes [[Daylight saving time in Canada|in accordance with US and Canadian rules]])

==={{flagu|Hungary}}===
Summer time was first introduced in Hungary in 1916, and it was observed until 1919. After that, summer time was in use between 1941–1949 and 1954–1957. Summer time has been in use again since 1980 and follows EU rules.

==={{flagu|Iceland}}===
[[Iceland]] uses UTC but has not used summer time since April 1968. From 1908 to 1968 Iceland used UTC−1. Summer time was used in 1917-1919, 1921 and 1939-1967.

==={{flagu|Ireland}}===
{{Further information|Time in Ireland}}

In [[Republic of Ireland|Ireland]], Summer Time, known as Irish Standard Time (IST) is observed during Summer (March to October). IST is sometimes mistaken for "Irish Summer Time", though this is incorrect.

==={{flagu|Italy}}, {{flagu|San Marino}}, and {{flagu|Vatican City}}===
Summer time is known as "ora legale" (literally "legal hour", referencing the fact that it's mandated by law) in [[Italy]], and it has been adopted and abolished several times: it was observed from 1916 to 1920 and between 1944 and 1948. A law was approved in 1965 that took effect the following year, and made the application of summer time mandatory in the whole country. Since 1996, it has been coordinated with the [[European Union]]. [[San Marino]] and [[Vatican City State]] share land borders solely with Italy and observe the same time as in Italy.

==={{flagu|Norway}}===
In Norway, summer time was observed in 1916, 1940–45, and 1959-65. The arrangement was controversial, and in 1965 the Norwegian parliament ([[Stortinget]]) voted to discontinue the practice. Their neighbour, Sweden, did not use it.

However, in 1980 summer time was reintroduced (together with Sweden and Denmark), and since at least 2002 Norway has followed the European Union in this matter.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.forskning.no/Artikler/2002/oktober/1035454427.68|title=Hva er sommertid?|work=Forskning.no|accessdate=2007-10-27|language=Norwegian}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==={{flagu|Poland}}===
In Poland, "the summer time" was observed in the following years:
* 1918
* 1946 - 1949
* 1957 - 1964
* 1977 - (still)
In the years 1979 - 1995 the last day of summer time was the last Saturday of September. In 1996 it was changed to the last Saturday of October, to synchronise with other countries of the EU.

==={{flagu|Portugal}}===
In Portugal, summer time (locally known by "Hora de Verão") was introduced in 1916. In the years 1922, 1923, 1925, 1930, 1933 and from 1967 to 1975 summer time was not applied.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.oal.ul.pt/download/dadosoutros/HoraLegaldesde1911.pdf|title=Hora Legal desde 1911 (Legal Time since 1911)|language=Portuguese|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120316015149/http://www.oal.ul.pt/download/dadosoutros/HoraLegaldesde1911.pdf|archivedate=2012-03-16|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
For many years the official time in the [[Madeira Islands]] was one hour earlier than that in [[Lisbon]], and the [[Azores Islands]] were two hours behind.
Today, in the Madeira Islands the official time is the same as that of Lisbon, and in the Azores Islands it is one hour behind Lisbon. The start and end dates for summer time in Portugal follow the pattern in the rest of the EU: the last Sunday in March to the last Sunday in October.

==={{flagu|Romania}}===
Summer time in Romania (locally known by "Ora de Vară") was originally introduced in 1932 (between 22 May and 2 October). Between 1933 and 1940 summer time started on the first Sunday in April and ended on the first Sunday in October. Summer time was abandoned in 1941 and reintroduced in 1979. Until 1996, with few exceptions, summer time started at the end of March and ended at the end of September. Since 1997, it has started in the last Sunday in March and ended on the last Sunday in October, in accordance with European Union rules.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.astro-urseanu.ro/ora_vara.html|title=Observatorul Astronomic - Ora de vara|accessdate=2008-11-15|language=Romanian}} Contains tables with all historical summer time start and end dates since 1932.&lt;/ref&gt;

==={{flagu|Russia}}===
{{Further information|Time in Russia}}
A decree of the [[Russian Provisional Government]] introduced summer time ({{lang-ru|летнее время}}) in [[Russia]] on 30 June 1917, and clocks moved one hour forward. A [[Soviet Decrees|decree]] of the [[Sovnarkom|Soviet government]] led to the abandonment of this system five months later: clocks moved one hour back again on 28 December.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.timeanddate.com/time/zone/russia/moscow?year=1916|title=Time Zone &amp; Clock Changes 1900-1924 in Moscow, Russia|author=|date=|website=www.timeanddate.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

From 1930, [[Decree time]] had the effect of imposing year-round time-zone advances in the Soviet Union.

A decision of the [[Council of Ministers (Soviet Union)|Council of Ministers of the USSR]] reintroduced summer time in the [[USSR]] ([[Moscow Summer Time]], for example) on 1 April 1981, and its practice continued into post-Soviet times until 2011. The changeover dates in [[Russia]] were the same as for other European countries, but clocks were moved forward or back at 02:00 local time in all zones. Thus in Moscow (local time = UTC+3 in winter, UTC+4 in summer), summer time commenced at 02:00 UTC on the day before the last Sunday in March, and ended at 03:00 UTC on the day before the last Sunday in October. (Note that "day before the last Sunday" is not the same as "the last Saturday" in a month where the last day is a Saturday.)

[[File:December 23, 2013 in Brateyevo (Moscow) at 9.06.jpg|thumbnail|right|Night black sky at 9:06 am (UTC+4) on 23 December 2013 in Moscow]]
On 8 February 2011, Russian President [[Dmitry Medvedev]] announced cancellation of biannual clock changes in Russia in favor of a permanent switch to summer time. An hour was added in March 2011 for the last time, and clocks did not move back again. At the same time some of Russia's time zones were consolidated.&lt;ref name=Gessen/&gt; After this reform many Russian cities had a "standard time" two hours more than would be suggested by their "astronomical time" (because the original standard time was already ahead of astronomical time in many areas).&lt;ref name=Gessen/&gt;

During his [[Russian presidential election, 2012 | 2012 election campaign]], [[Vladimir Putin]] proposed re-introducing summer time, as some workers had complained about not seeing any daylight during the winter, since the sun had not risen when they went to work.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.timeanddate.com/news/time/russia-daylight-saving-promise.html|title= Russian prime minister promises daylight saving time|publisher= Time and Date.com|date= 8 February 2012|accessdate= 4 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to a report in the ''International Herald Tribune'', Russian citizens remembered the winter of 2011-12 as the "darkest winter on record" as a result of the time change.&lt;ref name=Gessen/&gt; However, Putin later said it would be up to then Prime Minister Medvedev's cabinet to decide how to proceed with a seasonal time shift, and it decided to stay with the 2011 policy.&lt;ref name=Gessen&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 26 October 2014 Russia permanently returned to "winter" time.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/blogs-news-from-elsewhere-28423647 BBC Russia: Putin abolishes "daylight savings" time change]

&lt;/ref&gt;

==={{flagu|Slovakia}}===
[[Slovakia]] used summer time (locally known as "Letný čas") in 1916, 1917 and 1918, as part of the Austro-Hungarian Empire, then in the early 1940s, as part of Nazi Germany and annually since 1979, as part of Czechoslovakia. 

After several years, Slovakia established the rule that summer time begins in the last weekend of March (during the night from Saturday to Sunday) and ends in the last weekend of September. {{Citation needed|date=October 2018}}

After [[dissolution of Czechoslovakia]] in 1993, Slovakia continued to use summer time. Since 1996, summer time has been prolonged about one month so it lasts until the last weekend in October, in accordance with European Union rules.

==={{flagu|Slovenia}}===
Summer time in Slovenia (locally known as "Poletni čas") was introduced on 16 November 1982 when it was one of the Yugoslavia republics. Same law was valid until 1996 when the end of summer time was changed from first Sunday in October to last Sunday in October. In 2006, the European Union standard was adopted and is still used today.

==={{flagu|Sweden}}===
In [[Sweden]] summer time was originally introduced on 15 May 1916. It proved unpopular, and on 30 September in the same year, Sweden returned to year-round standard time. This continued for more than half a century.

On 6 April 1980, Sweden again introduced summer time, and since then summer time has been observed every summer in Sweden. Except for the introduction year 1980, summer time has always started on the last Sunday in March. It ended on the last Sunday in September during the years 1980-1995, and has ended on the last Sunday in October since 1996, following a unification of start/end dates of summer time within the [[European Union|EU]] as well as in several European countries then outside the EU.

The transit authority [[Västtrafik]] changes its clocks at 04:00, so that the last tram that leaves around 3:30 actually goes 2:30 on the last weekend of October for those who have changed their clocks at the legal time.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.facebook.com/Vasttrafik/posts/388878481135963 Natten mellan lördag och söndag går vi över till sommartid] (Swedish)&lt;/ref&gt; The public transport company [[Storstockholms Lokaltrafik|SL]] changes their clocks at the legal time, and runs extra departures during the October transition hour.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.svd.se/nyheter/stockholm/sommartid-blir-vintertid-aven-i-sl-trafiken_535945.svd Sommartid blir vintertid - även i SL-trafiken] (Swedish)&lt;/ref&gt;

==={{flagu|Switzerland}} and {{flagu|Liechtenstein}}===
The last country in Europe to adopt summer time, in 1981, was [[Switzerland]], even though summer time had been rejected by 52.1% of voters in a federal referendum in 1978.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.admin.ch/ch/f/pore/va/19780528/det283.html|title=Votation No|first=Chancellerie fédérale|last=ChF|date=|website=www.admin.ch}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Since 1996 Swiss summer time follows EU regulations. It had been in use in 1941 and 1942.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.suedostschweiz.ch/politik/seit-30-jahren-sommerzeit-der-schweiz|title=Seit 30 Jahren Sommerzeit in der Schweiz|author=|date=|website=www.suedostschweiz.ch}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Liechtenstein]] observes the same time as Switzerland. The German village of [[Büsingen am Hochrhein]], a small exclave, entirely surrounded by Swiss territory, also observes the same time as in Switzerland; it did not implement summer time in 1980, and observed the same time as Switzerland, so that there was a one hour time difference between this village and the rest of [[Germany]].

==={{flagu|Turkey}}===
Summer time was introduced in [[Turkey]] in 1947, but suspended from 1965 to 1972. Since 1974, Turkey follows European Summer Time.

In 2008, the Turkish Ministry of Energy proposed that Turkey should abolish summer time while at the same time switching to GMT +2.5, originally from 2009 onwards, but when this appeared infeasible, to start in 2011,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.worldtimezone.com/dst_news/dst_news_turkey02.html |title=Turkey to abandon daylight saving time in 2011|newspaper=[[Turkish Daily News]] |publisher=Worldtimezone.com |date=19 August 2008 |accessdate=2010-06-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; the plan has not been heard of since.

For the year 2011, Turkey switched to European Summer Time at 3:00 am (03:00) on Monday 28 March, one day later than the rest of Europe, to avoid disrupting the national university entrance examinations held on 27 March.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Turkey switches to summer time one day later |url=http://www.worldbulletin.net/?aType=haber&amp;ArticleID=70872 |publisher=World Bulletin |date=10 March 2011 |accessdate=2011-03-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Once again, for the year 2014, Turkey switched to European Summer Time at 3:00 am (03:00) on Monday 31 March, one day later than the rest of Europe, to avoid disrupting the [[Turkish local elections, 2014|local elections]] held on 30 March.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Turkey's election delays summertime |url=http://www.worldbulletin.net/turkey/131791/turkeys-election-delays-summertime |publisher=World Bulletin |date=23 March 2014 |accessdate=2014-03-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2015, Turkey delayed the switch from European Summer Time by 2 weeks, to 4:00 am (04:00) on Sunday 8 November, two weeks later than the rest of Europe, due to the calling of a [[Turkish general election, November 2015|snap general election]] on Sunday, 1 November.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=End of Daylight Saving Time delayed in Turkey |url=http://www.hurriyetdailynews.com/end-of-daylight-saving-time-delayed-in-turkey.aspx?pageID=238&amp;nID=89163&amp;NewsCatID=341 |publisher=Hürriyet |date=30 September 2015 |accessdate=2015-10-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2016, Turkey scrapped winter time, by switching to New Turkey Time. This means permanent UTC+3, which was used during summer time in Turkey. The switch was on 12:00 am (00:00) on Thursday 8 September, in reality stopping switches between summer and winter time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Scraps Winter Time delayed In Turkey

==={{flagu|Ukraine}}===
Summer time was introduced in [[Ukraine]] in the early 1980s; from 1981 till 1989 this was [[Moscow Summer Time]]; since 1992 [[Eastern European Summer Time]] has been used.&lt;ref name="Kyivwintertimeisgone"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Kyivwintertimeisback"/&gt;

On 20 September 2011 the [[Verkhovna Rada]] (Ukrainian parliament) voted not to return from Eastern European Summer Time to [[Eastern European Time]].&lt;ref name="Kyivwintertimeisgone"&gt;[http://www.kyivpost.com/news/nation/detail/113166/ Ukraine cancels use of daylight saving time], ''[[Kyiv Post]]'' (20 September 2011)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.worldtimezone.com/dst_news/dst_news_ukraine04.html Deputies cancelled the winter time], WorldTimeZone.com (20 September 2011)&lt;/ref&gt; This change would have had the effect of moving Ukraine into the [[Further-eastern European Time]] zone [[UTC+03:00]] along with Belarus and western Russia (which do not observe summer time). However, on 18 October 2011 the Parliament canceled these plans and the country returned to [[Eastern European Time]] as scheduled.&lt;ref name="Kyivwintertimeisback"&gt;[http://www.kyivpost.com/news/nation/detail/115146/ Ukraine to return to standard time on 30 Oct (updated)], ''[[Kyiv Post]]'' (18 October 2011)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.kyivpost.com/news/nation/detail/115182/ Ukraine cancels plan to drop winter time change], ''[[Kyiv Post]]'' (18 October 2011)&lt;/ref&gt; 295 MPs voted in favour out of 349 registered MPs.&lt;ref name="Kyivwintertimeisback"/&gt;

Crimea and regions of eastern Ukraine under the control of separatist militants observe [[Further-eastern European Time]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://tass.ru/en/world/756540|title=DPR and LPR switch over to Moscow time|publisher=[[ITAR TASS]]|date=26 October 2014|accessdate=15 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==={{flagu|United Kingdom}}===
{{main article|British Summer Time}}

In the [[United Kingdom]] local time during this period is known as [[British Summer Time]] (BST) ([[UTC+01:00]]) while local time during the rest of the year is normally referred to as [[Greenwich Mean Time|Greenwich Mean Time (GMT)]]. More generally British Summer Time is part of [[Western European Summer Time]].

Legislation: Summer Time Act 1916; Summer Time Act 1922;  Time (Ireland) Act, 1916; Summer Time Act, 1925;  Emergency Powers (Defence) Act, 1939; The Summer Time Order 1964; The Summer Time Order 1967; Summer Time Act 1972;  The Summer Time Order 1997; The Summer Time Order 2002.&lt;ref name=DSTUK&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.webexhibits.org/daylightsaving/uk.html|title=Full text - Daylight Saving Time - United Kingdom Law - The Summer Time Order 1997|author=|date=|website=www.webexhibits.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since 1996 all clocks in the European Union, of which the UK is a member state, have changed on same dates and at the same time, 01:00 GMT.&lt;ref name="wwp"&gt;[http://wwp.greenwichmeantime.com/time-zone/europe/uk/time/british-summer-time/ British Summer Time], wwp.greenwichmeantime.com&lt;/ref&gt;

*British Summer Time clocks change at 01:00 (1.00 am) Greenwich Mean Time (GMT).

The [[Channel Islands]] and [[Isle of Man]] observe the same time as the UK mainland.

The [[India|Republic of India]] uses one time zone, which is [[Indian Standard Time]] (IST).  This is [[UTC+05:30]] — that is, five and a half hours ahead of [[Coordinated Universal Time]].  India does not observe [[daylight saving time]] (DST or summer time).

The official time signal is given by the [[Time and Frequency Standards Laboratory]]. The [[IANA time zone database]] contains only one zone, namely [[Kolkata]]. The [[date and time notation in India]] shows some specialties.

== Recorded history ==
Some older time zones were:
* [[Bombay Time]] ([[UTC+04:51]]), 
* [[Madras Time]] (UTC+05:21)
* [[Calcutta Time]] (UTC+05:54), 
* [[Port Blair mean time]]

During the Sino–Indian War of 1962 and the Indo–Pakistani Wars of 1965 and 1971, daylight saving was briefly used to reduce civilian energy consumption.

===Ancient India===
One of the earliest known descriptions of ''standard time'' in India appeared in the 4th century CE [[Hindu astronomy|astronomical]] treatise [[Surya Siddhanta]]. Postulating a [[Spherical Earth|spherical earth]], the book described the thousands years old customs of the [[Prime Meridian|prime meridian]], or zero longitude, as passing through ''[[Avanti (India)|Avanti]]'', the ancient name for the historic city of [[Ujjain]], and ''Rohitaka'', the ancient name for [[Rohtak]] ({{Coord|28|54|N|76|38|E|type:city|name=Rohitaka (Rohtak)}}), a city near the [[Kurukshetra]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| jstor=330729| title=The Computation of the Length of Daylight in Hindu Astronomy| last=Schmidt| first=Olaf H.|year=1944| work= Isis, '''35'''(3):205–211| publisher=The University of Chicago Press}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The day used by ancient Indian astronomers began at sunrise at the prime meridian of Ujjain,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Swerdlow|first1=N.|title=A Lost Monument of Indian Astronomy:Das heliozentrische System in der griechischen, persischen und indischen Astronomie B. L. van der Waerden|journal=Isis|date=January 1973|volume=64|issue=2|pages=239–243|doi=10.1086/351088}}&lt;/ref&gt; and was divided into smaller time units in the following manner:&lt;ref name=das&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Das|first1=Sukumar Ranjan|title=The Equation of Time in Hindu Astronomy|journal=The American Mathematical Monthly|date=December 1928|volume=35|issue=10|pages=540–543|doi=10.2307/2298168|jstor=2298168}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt; Time that is measurable is that which is in common use, beginning with the ''prāṇa'' (or, the time span of one breath).  The ''pala'' contains six ''prāṇas''.  The ''ghalikā'' is 60 ''palas'', and the ''nakṣatra ahórātra'', or astronomical day, contains 60 ''ghalikās''.  A ''nakṣatra māsa'', or [[sidereal month|astronomical month]], consists of 30 days.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Taking a day to be 24 hours, the smallest time unit, ''prāṇa'', or one respiratory cycle, equals 4 seconds, a value consistent with the ''normal breathing frequency'' of 15 breaths/min used in modern medical research.&lt;ref&gt;Piepoli, M.  1997.  [http://circ.ahajournals.org/cgi/content/full/95/7/1813 "Origin of Respiratory Sinus Arrhythmia in Conscious Humans."]  ''Circulation''.  '''95''':1813–1821.  Retrieved 1 December 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; The Surya Siddhanta also described a method of converting local time to the standard time of Ujjain.&lt;ref name=burgess&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Burgess|first1=Ebenezer|title=Translation of the Surya-Siddhanta, A Text-Book of Hindu Astronomy; With Notes, and an Appendix|journal=Journal of the American Oriental Society|date=1858|volume=6|pages=183–186|doi=10.2307/592174|jstor=592174}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite these early advances, standard time was not widely used outside astronomy. For most of [[History of India|India's history]], ruling kingdoms kept their own local time, typically using the [[Hindu calendar]] in both [[sidereal time|lunar]] and [[solar time|solar]] units.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.es.flinders.edu.au/~mattom/science+society/lecture7.html| title=Lecture 7: Living with the seasons&amp;mdash;the calendar problem|accessdate=2006-12-01| last=Tomczak| first=Matthias|date=2004-07-15 |publisher=Lectures on Science, civilization and society, Flinders University, Australia}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, the [[Jantar Mantar (Jaipur)|Jantar Mantar]] observatory built by [[Jai Singh II of Amber|Maharaja Sawai Jai Singh]] in [[Jaipur]] in 1733 contains large [[sundial]]s, up to 90&amp;nbsp;ft (27&amp;nbsp;m) high, which were used to accurately determine the local time.

===Time under British rule in India===
In 1802 [[Madras time]] was set up by [[John Goldingham]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|editor=William Nicholson|title=Eclipses of the Satellites of Jupiter, observed by John Goldingham and under his Superintendence, at Madras, in the East Indies|journal=A Journal of Natural Philosophy, Chemistry, and the Arts|publisher=Stratford, Crown Court and Temple Bar|location=London|date=1809|volume=22|pages=153–156|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=xJAOjlQ6TNMC&amp;pg=PA153&amp;dq=madras+time++goldingham+1802&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=eEy_UbrcHI689QTziYGwCQ&amp;ved=0CEgQ6AEwBQ#v=onepage&amp;q=madras%20time%20%20goldingham%201802&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; and this was later used widely by the railways in India.&lt;ref name="Princely states"/&gt; Local time zones were also set up in the important cities of [[Bombay time (time zone)|Bombay]] and [[Calcutta time|Calcutta]] and as Madras time was intermediate to these, it was one of the early contenders for an Indian standard time zone.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title=On Time in India|journal=Proceedings of the Asiatic Society of Bengal|publisher=Asiatic Society of Bengal|location=Calcutta|date=April 1899|pages=49–55|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=kIIbAQAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA51&amp;dq=%22madras+time%22&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=Z9O8UZeqEYaH0QGruYH4BA&amp;ved=0CC0Q6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=%22madras%20time%22&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title=On the Introduction of a Standard Time for India|journal=Proceedings of the Asiatic Society of Bengal|publisher=Asiatic Society of Bengal|location=Calcutta|date=June 1899|pages=62–66|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=kIIbAQAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA63&amp;dq=%22Calcutta+time%22+%22madras+time%22&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=Z9O8UZeqEYaH0QGruYH4BA&amp;ved=0CC0Q6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=%22Calcutta%20time%22%20%22madras%20time%22&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; Though [[British Raj|British India]] did not officially adopt the standard time zones until 1905, when the meridian passing east of Allahabad at 82.5° E longitude was picked as the central meridian for India, corresponding to a single time zone for the country ([[UTC+5:30]]). [[Indian Standard Time]] came into force on 1 January 1906, and also applied to [[Sri Lanka]] (then [[Ceylon]]). However, Calcutta time was officially maintained as a separate time zone until 1948 and Bombay time until 1955.&lt;ref name="Princely states"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.irfca.org/faq/faq-misc.html |title=Odds and Ends |accessdate=2006-11-25 |work= Indian Railways Fan Club}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1925, time synchronisation began to be relayed through omnibus telephone systems and control circuits to organisations that needed to know the precise time. This continued until the 1940s, when time signals began to be broadcast using the radio by the government.&lt;ref name="Princely states"/&gt; Briefly during World War II, clocks under Indian Standard Time were advanced by one hour, referred to as War Time. This provision lasted from September 1, 1942 to October 15, 1945.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.timeanddate.com/worldclock/timezone.html?n=54&amp;syear=1925&lt;/ref&gt;

===After independence===
After [[Indian independence movement|independence in 1947]], the [[Government of India|Indian government]] established [[Indian Standard Time|IST]] as the official time for the whole country, although Mumbai and Kolkata retained their own local time for a few more years.&lt;ref name="Princely states"/&gt; In 2014 [[Assam]]ese politicians proposed following a daylight-saving schedule that would be ahead of IST by an hour, but as of January 2014 this had not been approved by the central government.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ndtv.com/article/india/india-gets-its-second-time-zone-as-assam-turns-its-clock-ahead-by-an-hour-466326 India may get its second time zone if Assam turns its clock ahead by an hour]&lt;/ref&gt;

As of October 2014, Tricolor TV provided satellite services to over fifteen million subscribers (approximately 40 000 000 viewers).&lt;ref name="now1234"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://spb.tricolor.tv/presscenter/pressreleases/114 |title="Триколор ТВ" подключил 15-миллионного абонента и увеличил ARPU|work=Пресс-центр "Триколор ТВ"|date=10 August 2014 |accessdate = 27 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the research of J'son and Partners Consulting, Tricolor TV leads [[HDTV]] broadcasting in Russia (39,6%).&lt;ref name=json&gt;{{cite web|author=J'son and Partners|date=8 October 2014|url=http://json.tv/ict_telecom_analytics_view/issledovanie-auditorii-lineynogo-hd-veschaniya-v-rossii-po-itogam-1-polugodiya-2014-goda|title=Исследование аудитории линейного HD-вещания в России по итогам 1 полугодия 2014 года|publisher=[[J'son and Partners Consulting]]|accessdate = 27 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Tricolor TV is the Russian pioneer of [[UHDTV]] broadcasting also.&lt;ref name=ultra&gt;{{cite web|author=Игорь Королев|date=23 October 2014|url=http://www.cnews.ru/top/2014/10/23/v_rossii_poyavilsya_pervyy_telekanal_ultra_hd_588982|title=В России появился первый телеканал Ultra HD|publisher=[[CNews]]|accessdate = 27 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Broadcasting under the trademarks of Tricolor TV and Tricolor TV Siberia is carried out by the National Satellite Company, CJSC (NSC, {{lang-ru|Национальная спутниковая компания}}).

==Company history==

=== Founding and early growth (2005 — 2011) ===
{{cquote|Project idea is based on the fact that there is a significant disparity in terms of access to TV channels. In large cities with population over 500,000 at least 15 channels broadcast from the TV transmitter can be received almost everywhere. However, if you drive 20 km away from the transmitter, the picture is getting worse, within 30 km there are serious problems with reception and within 50 km range you can just forget about regular terrestrial TV. These are the numbers that frightened me. Over 50 million people in Russia have an opportunity to receive 5 or less TV channels, generally, with weak signal. Over 20 million people watch 1 channel, the second one's reception quality is too low.|20px|20px|Dmitry Volobuev, first executive director of NSC.&lt;ref name="now1234 2"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.telesputnik.ru/archive/121/article/26.html |title=Не будет абонентской платы!|work=ТелеСпутник|date=2005-11-11 |accessdate = 2010-09-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

National Satellite Company, CJSC was founded at 2005 and registered the trademark. It began test broadcast via [[Eutelsat W4]] on the night of 1 October 2005.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.kommersant.ru/doc-y.aspx?DocsID=632399|title=Телеканалам предлагают оплатить зрителей|author=Валерий Кодачигов.|date=5 December 2005|publisher=''[[Коммерсантъ]]''| accessdate=6 August 2011 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/68DsN0AZQ|archivedate=6 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; First of all, company solved the problem of broadcasting Russian TV channels, therefore new provider was named Tricolor TV (in association with [[Flag of Russia|Russian three-color flag]]). On 12 November Tricolor TV started full-time broadcasting. Subscribers gained access to five channels: Russia (it was rebranded as [[Russia-1]] later), [[REN TV]], Kultura (Russian ''culture'', rebranded as [[Russia-K]]), DTV (this channel was rebranded as [[Peretz]], Russian ''pepper'') and [[TV-3 (Russia)|TV-3]] (broadcasts TV series in mystery, science fiction and fantasy genres).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.telesputnik.ru/ts/news/1578#.T32QsfDcQ7s|title="Триколор ТВ" дарит телевидение будущего|publisher=''Broadcasting.Телевидение и радиовещание''|date=November 2005| accessdate=28 February 2011 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/68DsPdfUs|archivedate=6 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Broadcasting was free of charge and it made the provider popular and growing.

For half a year, at May 2006 Tricolor TV was subscribed by 150 000 Russian householders.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.kommersant.ru/doc-y.aspx?DocsID=678601|title="Триколор" набирает абонентов на вырост|author=Валерий Кодачигов.|date=1 June 2006|publisher=''[[Коммерсантъ]]''|accessdate=6 August 2011|archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/66Bis0oQx|archivedate=15 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Free-of-charge package was increased to 14 channels, including Tricolor TV’s infochannel.

At February 2007, the number of subscribers was 500 thousand households.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cnews.ru/news/line/index.shtml?2007/02/07/234594|title="Триколор ТВ" смотрят полмиллиона российских семей|date=7 February 2007|publisher=''[[CNews (журнал)|CNews]]''|accessdate=6 August 2011|archiveurl=http://www.peeep.us/8c22625c|archivedate=15 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; 1 April 2007 Tricolor TV started broadcasting [[Channel One Russia]] and its sister channels: Telenyanya (now children's channel [[Carousel (TV channel)|Carousel]]) and [[Dom Kino]] (Russian ''the house of cinema'').

At May 2007 Tricolor TV introduced commercial pack of channels.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.finmarket.ru/z/nws/news.asp?id=597957|title=Телекомпания "Триколор ТВ" начала передавать через спутник Eutelsat&amp;nbsp;W4 пакет из десяти платных каналов|date=11 May 2007|publisher=''Финмаркет''|accessdate=6 August 2011|archiveurl=http://www.peeep.us/829983ba|archivedate=15 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; To this end, the satellite Eutelsat W4 was rented another transponder. The package includes 10 channels (later package Optimum). 10 December 2007 the company began broadcasting in Siberia from satellite Bonum-1.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.telesputnik.ru/ts/news/1190#.T32WlPDcQ7s|publisher=''ТелеСпутник''|title=Спутниковый оператор "Триколор ТВ" приходит в Сибирь|date=November 2007| accessdate=28 February 2011 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/68DsQWXRc|archivedate=6 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; 1 March 2008 Tricolor TV began commercial broadcasting. Technology partners of Tricolor TV Siberia became [[Russian Satellite Communications Company]] and [[Harmonic Inc.]]

At 2010, Tricolor TV started broadcasting new packages of channels: Super Optimum (a lot of channeles in MPEG-4 format), Night Package (a package of erotic TV channels) and channel of [[Russian Football Premier League]].
From February 2010 to 24 March 2012 Tricolor TV provided services of [[satellite internet access]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.gazeta.ru/business/2012/02/14/kz_4001009.shtml|title = "Триколор" отключил интернет|last = Матвеева|first = Анастасия.|date = 15 February 2012|publisher = [[Газета.Ru]]|quote = Бизнес — 20 строк|accessdate = 14 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Cancelled merger of Tricolor TV and NTV Plus (2009 — 2010) ===

15 September 2009, it became known that [[Gazprom Media]] group signed with NSC memorandum, according to which part of the service and channel [[NTV Plus]] is available to subscribers of Tricolor TV. Interested in this transaction, the [[Federal Antimonopoly Service]], as after the proposed transaction Gazprom Media would control 97% of satellite TV in Russia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rian.ru/society/20090918/185501698.html|title=Покупка "Газпром-Медиа" компании "Триколор ТВ" вызвала вопросы у ФАС|date=18 September 2009|publisher=''[[РИА Новости]]''|accessdate=6 August 2011|archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/66BjOU5js|archivedate=15 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Deal has not progressed.

'''Underdevelopment''', relating to [[international development]], reflects a broad condition or phenomena defined and critiqued by theorists in fields such as [[economics]], [[development studies]], and [[postcolonial studies]]. Used primarily to distinguish states along benchmarks concerning human development—such as [[Economic growth|macro-economic growth]], health, education, and [[Standard of living|standards of living]]—an "underdeveloped" state is framed as the antithesis of a "[[Developed country|developed]]", modern, or industrialized state. Popularized, dominant images of underdeveloped states include those that have less stable economies, less [[Democracy|democratic]] political regimes, greater [[poverty]], [[malnutrition]], and poorer [[public health]] and education systems. 

Underdevelopment per [[Walter Rodney]] is primarily made of two components, a comparative aspect as well the relationship of exploitation: namely, the exploitation of one country by another.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|title=How Europe Underdeveloped Africa|date=2018-09-26|url=https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=How_Europe_Underdeveloped_Africa&amp;oldid=861237572|work=Wikipedia|language=en|access-date=2018-09-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Unreliable source?|reason=Wikipedia cannot source itself - this needs to be cited to a specific page in Rodney's book itself.|certain=y|date=September 2018}} 

==History==

In critical development and postcolonial studies, the concepts of "development", "developed", and "underdevelopment" are often thought of to have origins in two periods: first, the [[Colonialism|colonial]] era, where colonial powers extracted labor and natural resources, and second (most often) in referring development as the postwar project of intervention on the so-called [[Third World]]. Mexican activist [[Gustavo Esteva]] asserted that underdevelopment began when American president [[Harry S. Truman|Harry Truman]] delivered his inaugural address in 1949 since, after the [[World War II|second world war]], poverty on a mass scale was suddenly "discovered" in these underdeveloped regions of the world. Esteva stated: "On that day two billion people became underdeveloped." More than half of the world's nations were categorized by what they lacked.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Encountering Development: The Making and Unmaking of the Third World.|last=Escobar|first=Arturo|publisher=Princeton University Press|year=1995|isbn=|location=Princeton|pages=21–46|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Eurocentrism|Euro-centric]] development discourse and its aura of expertise often conflated development with economic growth. When the world began to categorize nations based on their economic status, it narrowed the issue of underdevelopment to an economics problem. As a result, the solutions brought forth by development experts and practitioners were squarely economic—failing to address the profound political and social contexts such as colonial legacies and [[Cold War]] geopolitics.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Development and Social Change: A Global Perspective|last=McMichael|first=Philip|publisher=Sage|year=2012|isbn=|location=Thousand Oaks|pages=26–54|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== The Green Revolution ===
The [[Green Revolution]] is a paradigm of a concerted effort of intervention in the name of global development. During this time, developed countries, in an attempt to modernize the global agricultural sector, sought to export the industrial agricultural model of production.  At the start of the Green Revolution, the U.S., Canada, and other advanced European countries were giving their surplus crops to poorer countries in the form of food aid in order to mitigate widespread hunger that parts of the postcolonial world was then witnessing. Crops that weren’t previously prevalent across the globe, such as wheat, were being transferred and from the global north to south in massive quantities. This occurred until developing countries, such as India,  became  heavily dependent on the food aid—much of which were crops that could not be grown locally. In order for dependent countries to keep receiving foreign assistance, the U.S. made it conditional for recipients of food-aid to adopt the whole industrial model of agriculture.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Food|last=Clapp|first=Jennifer|publisher=Cambridge: Polity Press|year=2012|isbn=|location=|pages=24–56|quote=|via=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The revolution was titled  “Green” not just because of its connections to agriculture but also was used as a tool to fight the “Red”, or communist revolution.  The West  believed that hunger had the power to drive people to peasant revolutions, so food aid was used explicitly to fight the spread communism.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; While efforts were made to increase food security in poor nations by helping them move to being self-sufficient, the industrial model of agriculture that was exported to recipient countries had a complex system of necessary inputs. In order for yields to actually increase, farmers needed fertilizers, pesticides, and new irrigation systems, a costly chain of requirements that cut profits for the farmers even when their yields rose. The countries that were dependent on food aid now became dependent on the transnational corporations that provided agricultural inputs that the industrial model required. The Green Revolution was able to increase crop yields (at least in the short term, before land was degraded by the increased need for fertilizers and pesticides), but in the process it exacerbated vulnerable populations' poverty in countries that are now considered underdeveloped.

==Theories==

Two theories in particular have shaped assumptions of development, in terms of their translation into large-scale influence in scholarship, public opinion, and political policies: modernization and dependency theories.

===Modernization theory===
One of the first major theories to surface as a solution to this new issue of “underdevelopment” was the [[modernization theory]]. This highlights the positive role played by Western countries in [[Modernization|modernizing]] and facilitating development in the non-West. It is often contrasted with [[dependency theory]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.123exp-business.com/t/04254366384/ Modernization theory - Economics Dictionary and Research Guide&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

The theory of modernization consists of three parts:
* A hierarchical identification of nations or societies, and explanation of how those designated as "modernized" or relatively modernized differ from others
* Specification of how societies become modernized, comparing factors that are more or less conducive to transformation
* Generalizations about how the parts of a modernized society fit together, involving stages of modernization and ideal types of successfully modernized countries&lt;ref&gt;[http://science.jrank.org/pages/10273/Modernization-Theory-Defining-Modernization-Theory.html Modernization Theory - Defining Modernization Theory&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;
In the mid-20th century, the world leaders that had emerged from the Second World War saw the former colonies as areas that needed increasing amounts of intervention because their populations were the subjects of much suffering. It became a moral imperative for developed nations, primarily the U.S., to offer assistance so that these countries could industrialize the way the countries of the first world had. The modernization theory, growing out of U.S. scholarship, equated modernization with industrialization, development, and progress.

One of the most notable contributors to the theory was [[Walt Whitman Rostow]] who developed an economic model which outlined five stages of growth for nations to follow in his essay, “The Stages of Economic Growth: A Non-Communist Manifesto”.

Rostow’s Five Stages:
# The Traditional Society
# The Preconditions for take-off
# The Take-off
# The Drive to Maturity
# The Age of High Mass Consumption

These stages present a linear trajectory of development in a which the traditional society, exhibiting feudal and “backward” characteristics, can transform into a modern society with advanced industries and urban societies.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Stages of Economic Growth: A Non-Communist Manifesto|last=W. Rostow|first=Walt|publisher=|year=1960|isbn=|location=|pages=|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; By placing national growth on a linear path to modernization and hails industrialization as the key to development, Rostow's model simplifies complex inequality between nations by claiming that (since various nations began the process of development at different time periods) different societies are simply at different stages of growth. Rostow’s model makes the assumption that  the inequality between states will eventually disappear once each progresses on the timeline of modernity—sped up, he argued, through contact with modernized cultures and their modern economic and political models.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title="The Five Stages of Growth" In Development and Underdevelopment: The Political Economy of Global Inequality|last=Seligson|first=Mitchell|publisher=Boulder and London: Lynne Rienner Publishers|year=1990|isbn=|location=|pages=9–16|quote=|via=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Dependency theory===
[[Dependency theory]] reflects the body of mid-20th century theories by various intellectuals, both from the [[Third World]] and the [[First World]], that suggest that the wealthy nations of the world need a subjugated peripheral group of poorer states in order to remain wealthy. Dependency theory states that the poverty of the countries in the periphery is not because they are ''not'' integrated into the world system, but because of ''how'' they are integrated into the system.

These poor nations provide natural resources, cheap labor, and consumer markets for the wealthy nations, without which, according to dependency theorists, they could not have the standard of living they enjoy. First world nations actively, but not necessarily consciously, perpetuate a state of dependency through various policies and initiatives. This state of dependency is multifaceted, involving [[economics]], [[Media influence|media control]], [[politics]], [[banking]] and [[finance]], [[education]], [[sport]] and all aspects of [[human resource development]]. Any attempt by the dependent nations to resist the influences of dependency could result in economic sanctions and/or military invasion and control. This is rare, however, and dependency is enforced far more by the wealthy nations setting the rules of international trade and commerce.

Dependency theory first emerged in the 1950s, advocated by [[Raul Prebisch]] whose research found that the wealth of poor nations tended to decrease when the wealth of rich nations increased. The theory quickly divided into diverse schools. Some, most notably [[Andre Gunder Frank]] and [[Walter Rodney]] adapted it to [[Marxism]]. "Standard" dependency theory differs sharply from Marxism, however, arguing against internationalism and any hope of progress in less developed nations towards industrialization and a liberating revolution. Former Brazilian President [[Fernando Henrique Cardoso]] wrote extensively on dependency theory while in political exile. The American sociologist [[Immanuel Wallerstein]] refined the Marxist aspect of the theory, and called it the "[[World-system theory|world system]]."&lt;ref&gt;[http://abcworld.net/Dependency_theory.html Dependency theory] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130408001205/http://abcworld.net/Dependency_theory.html |date=April 8, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; World system theory adds another layer to what dependency theorists describe as the structure of the world: the semi-periphery. The semi-periphery is composed of countries such as Brazil and South Africa that can't simply be categorized as part of the core or the periphery (i.e. they have developed urban areas but also large areas of rural poverty). World systems  theory also states that the dynamic of surplus extraction that occurs between nations also occurs within them, between their elite and poor classes. According to this structure, which includes a core, a periphery, and a semi-periphery, not every nation can develop simultaneously (which directly challenges the linear model  of modernization which suggests that all countries are on the trajectory of development).  WST instead argues that development and underdevelopment are created simultaneously.

According to Brazilian social scientist, Theotonio Dos Santos, dependence means a situation in which certain countries economies' are conditioned by the development and expansion of another to which the former is subject. He goes on to further clarify that the interdependence of two or more economies, and consequently world trade, assumes the form of dependence when dominant countries can create dependency only as a reflection of that expansion, which can have a negative effect on the subordinate’s immediate economy.

Guyanese Marxist historian and political activist and one of the leading theorists on underdevelopment [[Walter Rodney]] contends in reference to Africa's underdevelopment, "The decisiveness of the short period of colonialism and its negative consequences for Africa spring mainly from the fact that Africa lost power. Power is the ultimate determinant in human society, being basic to the relations within any group and between groups. It implies the ability to defend one's interests and if necessary to impose one's will by any means available. In relations between peoples, the question of power determines maneuverability in bargaining, the extent to which a people survive as a physical and cultural entity. When one society finds itself forced to relinquish power entirely to another society, that in itself is a form of underdevelopment".&lt;ref name="Irogbe"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Irogbe|first=Kema|date=Spring 2005|title=Globalization and the Development of Underdevelopment of the Third World|journal=Journal of Third World Studies|publisher=[[EBSCO Information Services]]|volume=22|issue=1|pages=41–68|url=http://connection.ebscohost.com/c/articles/17240316/globalization-development-underdevelopment-third-world|accessdate=June 2014}}{{subscription needed}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Rodney also elaborates on his broader theory of underdevelopment and the issues of using the term especially in reference to comparing economies, saying "Actually, if 'underdevelopment' were related to anything other than comparing economies, then the most underdeveloped country in the world would be the U.S.A, which practices external oppression on a massive scale, while internally there is a blend of exploitation, brutality, and psychiatric disorder." &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://www.worldcat.org/title/how-europe-underdeveloped-africa/oclc/7552523|title=How Europe underdeveloped Africa|last=Rodney|first=Walter|last2=Babu|first2=A.

'''''Urechis unicinctus''''' ({{CJKV|s=海肠|t=海腸|p=hǎicháng|cy=hóichèuhng|j=螠虫|r=yumushi|k=개불|rr=gaebul}}) is a species of the [[Echiura|marine spoon worm]].

On the surface of the body there are many small papillae. There is a flat snout that can be clipped to the front of the mouth and can be seen as a head of another animal with a brain in the snout.

U-shaped burrows are formed when breeding. Males and females produce eggs and sperm, respectively.  

In Korea, they are eaten for food.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://terms.naver.com/entry.nhn?docId=1057766&amp;cid=40942&amp;categoryId=32473|title=개불|access-date=2018-03-17|language=ko}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is used as bait for fish such as flounder and sea bream. They are distributed in Korea, Japan, and the Pacific coast.

==Habitat==
''U. unicinctus'', like other species of ''Urechis'', lives and burrows in sand and mud. It gets the name "fat innkeeper worm" because the tunnels often contain other animals.

==Economic use==
This spoon worm is commonly eaten [[wikt:raw|raw]] with [[salt]] and [[sesame oil]] or [[gochujang]] in [[Korea]].

In [[Chinese cuisine]] the worm is [[stir-fried]] with vegetables, or dried and powdered to be used as an [[umami]] enhancer.

It is also used for [[fishing bait]].

'''Yamal-402''' is a [[Russia]]n [[geostationary]] [[communications satellite]]. It was launched on 8 December 2012, 13:13:43 [[UTC]] from [[Baikonur Cosmodrome Site 200|Site 200/39]] at the [[Baikonur Cosmodrome]] in [[Kazakhstan]].&lt;ref name=sp101&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.spaceflight101.com/launch-calendar-december-2012.html|title=December 2012 Launch Calendar|publisher=Spaceflight101}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It was built by [[Thales Alenia Space]], and is based on the [[Spacebus]] 4000C3 [[satellite bus]]. It is equipped with 46 [[J band (NATO)|J band]] (IEEE [[Ku band|K&lt;sub&gt;u&lt;/sub&gt; band]]) [[transponder]]s.&lt;ref name="SB"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.satbeams.com/satellites?norad=39022|title=Yamal-402 at SatBeams|publisher=SatBeams}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It has a design life of 15 years, but reducing to 11 years expected after launch partial failure.&lt;ref name="GSP"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://space.skyrocket.de/doc_sdat/yamal-402.htm|title=Yamal-402 at Gunter's Space Page|publisher=Gunter's Space Page}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Launch problem==
In February 2009, Gazprom Space Systems announced a contract with [[Thales Alenia Space]] for two satellites: [[Yamal-401]] and '''Yamal-402'''.&lt;ref name=gsp-yamal401 /&gt; This was the first time a foreign supplier would build a satellite for internal Russian market. After much lobby from local industry, the contract for the bus and integration of Yamal-401 is cancelled and awarded to ISS Reshetnev, but Thales is allowed to keep the payload supply.&lt;ref name=gsp-yamal4012 /&gt;&lt;ref name=kosmonavtika-yamalhistorie6 /&gt;&lt;ref name=thales-yamal402pr20100528 /&gt;

On November 6, 2012, the satellite arrives at the launch site of [[Baikonur Cosmodrome|Baikonur]]. &lt;ref name=thales-yamal402pr20121106 /&gt; On December 8, 2012 13:13:43&amp;nbsp;UTC a Proton-M/Briz-M launches Yamal-402 to a [[geostationary transfer orbit]]. &lt;ref name=kosmonavtika-yamal402launch /&gt; The same day, [[Khrunichev Center]] and [[International Launch Services]] reported an anomaly during the launch in which the Briz-M stage failed 4 minutes before scheduled shut down on its fourth burn.&lt;ref name=ils-pr20121208la /&gt;&lt;ref name=nsf-20121208iply4s /&gt;

On December 10, specialists from Thales Alenia Space carried out maneuvers to bring the satellite into its designated orbit after a premature separation from Briz-M. &lt;ref name=ria-russia20121211178063835 /&gt;&lt;ref name=thales-yamal402pr20121210 /&gt; On 15 December 15, Yamal-402 was taken to its planned geostationary orbit at the [[altitude]] of 36,000&amp;nbsp;km following a series of four adjustment operations.&lt;ref name=ria-science20121215178170837 /&gt; The satellite lost 4 years of fuel to compensate for lower than expected orbit injection.&lt;ref name=gsp-yamal402 /&gt;
