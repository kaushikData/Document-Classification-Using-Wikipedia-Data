The '''2010 Itawamba County School District prom controversy''' took place in [[Itawamba County, Mississippi]], and began when lesbian student Constance McMillen was refused permission to take her girlfriend to the Itawamba County Agricultural High School [[prom]].  As a result of a lawsuit brought against the school, the school canceled the prom. Parents were encouraged to organize a private prom, but they canceled it.  A second private prom was organized and represented to be the official prom.  Meanwhile, parents organized a secret prom to which McMillen was not invited and which most of the student body attended.  The school district settled the lawsuit by agreeing to a payment to McMillen and adoption of a sexual orientation non-discrimination policy.&lt;ref name="cnn20100720"&gt;{{cite news

==Incident==
In March 2010, the [[Itawamba County School District]] board made international news after it decided to cancel the [[prom]] for Itawamba Agricultural High School because 18-year-old lesbian student Constance McMillen had requested permission to take a same-sex date to the event, and to wear a [[tuxedo]].&lt;ref name="usatodayprom"&gt;{{cite news|title=Miss. prom canceled after lesbian's date request |first=Chris |last=Joyner |url=https://www.usatoday.com/news/nation/2010-03-10-noprom_N.htm |newspaper=[[USA Today]] |publisher=[[Gannett Company]] |location=[[McLean, Virginia]], US |issn=0734-7456 |date=March 11, 2010 |accessdate=May 31, 2010 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5okMbDs7o?url=http://www.usatoday.com/news/nation/2010-03-10-noprom_N.htm |archivedate=April 4, 2010 |deadurl=no |df=mdy }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="AP-yahoonews"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://news.yahoo.com/s/ap/20100311/ap_on_re_us/us_lesbian_prom_date |title=Lesbian teen back at Miss. school after prom flap |author=Sheila Byrd ([[Associated Press]]) |work=[[Yahoo!

On March 10, 2010, the ACLU filed a free speech lawsuit on McMillen's behalf, seeking an [[injunction]] which would reinstate the prom.

On a March 12, 2010 appearance on the national [[The Early Show|CBS Early Show]], McMillen said that she had first asked the school principal about bringing a same-sex date to the prom in December 2009, and that he said it was not allowed, due to a concern that pairs of same-sex friends who were not in a relationship would buy less expensive couples tickets instead of individual tickets.&lt;ref name="cbsearly1"&gt;{{cite news | url= http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2010/03/12/earlyshow/main6292120.shtml | title= Lesbian Teen Speaks Out on Cancelled Prom |work=[[The Early Show]] | date= March 12, 2010 | accessdate=March 12, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;  McMillen said she told him "you can't pretend like there's not gay people at our school, and if you tell people they can't bring a same-sex date, that is discrimination to them."  Although the school board did not explicitly say the prom was cancelled due to McMillen's request, the cancellation came only one week after the ACLU sent a letter to the board pleading her case.&lt;ref name="cbsearly1"/&gt;

Subsequent to international press coverage of the prom's cancellation, many groups offered to sponsor a non-discriminatory prom and enough money was reportedly raised to host one.&lt;ref name="clarion-2ndprom"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.clarionledger.com/article/20100316/NEWS/3160350/1001/NEWS |title=Itawamba prom hearing could be held by Monday |author=Chris Joyner |work=[[The Clarion-Ledger]] |date=March 15, 2010 |accessdate=March 17, 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5okLEQDxG?url=http://www.clarionledger.com/article/20100316/NEWS/3160350/1001/NEWS |archivedate=April 4, 2010 |df=mdy }} Archived at&lt;/ref&gt;  However, it was reported that adults posted signs in protest on the high school, including ones stating "What happened to the Bible Belt?", and "Gomorrah".&lt;ref name="clarion-2ndprom"/&gt;

==Court ruling==
On March 23, 2010, U.S. District Court Judge [[Glen H. Davidson]] issued a ruling partly in favor of McMillen and partly favorable to the Itawamba County School District.&lt;ref name="judgeruling"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.clarionledger.com/article/20100324/NEWS/3240360 |title=Both sides claim win in lesbian's prom lawsuit |author=Chris Joyner |work=[[The Clarion-Ledger]] |date=March 24, 2010 |accessdate=March 24, 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5oSo2Krxa?url=http://www.clarionledger.com/article/20100324/NEWS/3240360 |archivedate=March 24, 2010 |df=mdy }} Archived at&lt;/ref&gt; Judge Davidson ruled that Itawamba County School District did violate McMillen's [[First Amendment to the United States Constitution|First Amendment]] rights by not allowing her to attend the prom with her girlfriend, not allowing her to wear a tuxedo and cancelling the prom.&lt;ref name="judgeruling"/&gt; Judge Davidson wrote, "The court finds this expression and communication of her viewpoint is the type of speech that falls squarely within the purview of the First Amendment."&lt;ref name="judgeruling"/&gt; However, in favor of the Itawamba County School District, Judge Davidson ruled that he would not force the school district to hold the prom since a private prom had already been planned.&lt;ref name="judgeruling"/&gt; At the preliminary hearing, school board members testified that all junior and senior students would be allowed to attend the private prom but did not make it clear as to whether or not same-sex couples would be allowed to attend.&lt;ref name="judgeruling"/&gt; McMillen received no official information on, or an invitation to, the private prom.&lt;ref name="cnnjudgeruling"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.cnn.com/2010/LIVING/03/23/mississippi.lesbians.prom/index.html |title=Judge: School violated lesbian's rights, but prom cancellation valid |author=CNN Wire Staff |publisher=CNN |date=March 23, 2010 |accessdate=March 24, 2010 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100325032525/http://www.cnn.com/2010/LIVING/03/23/mississippi.lesbians.prom/index.html |archivedate=March 25, 2010 |deadurl=bot: unknown |df=mdy }} Archived at&lt;/ref&gt;

During the hearing, the school board testified that they cancelled the prom because the "media attention generated distracted the school from its educational mission, and that the board cancelled the prom in an attempt to restore order".&lt;ref name="judgeruling"/&gt; Judge Davidson said he was not swayed by that testimony because the high school's own principal had testified to the opposite, saying that "e-mail and phone calls generated by the controversy had no impact on classroom instruction".&lt;ref name="judgeruling"/&gt;

On July 20, 2010, the school district settled the case out of court by paying McMillen $35,000, paying her attorneys' fees, and agreeing to create a non-discrimination policy that includes sexual orientation.&lt;ref name=ut0720 /&gt;

==Private prom==
On March 30, 2010, ''[[The Clarion-Ledger]]'' newspaper reported that the original private prom scheduled to be held at the Tupelo Furniture Market had been cancelled after McMillen attempted to purchase a ticket.&lt;ref name="privatecancelled"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.hattiesburgamerican.com/article/20100330/NEWS01/100330015/Parent-sponsored+prom+in+Itawamba+canceled+ |title=Parent-sponsored prom in Itawamba canceled |author=Chris Joyner |work=[[The Clarion-Ledger]] |date=March 30, 2010 |accessdate=April 1, 2010 }} Archived at [https://www.webcitation.org/5okKwkstm?url=http://www.hattiesburgamerican.com/article/20100330/NEWS01/100330015/Parent-sponsored%20prom%20in%20Itawamba%20canceled WebCite]&lt;/ref&gt; Lori Byrd, who served on the parent organizing committee of the private prom, told the newspaper that there were many parents involved who did not want to be sued for not allowing same-sex dates at the private prom, so they cancelled it.&lt;ref name="privatecancelled"/&gt; However, the ''[[Northeast Mississippi Daily Journal]]'' reported the following day that a new private prom had been organized, to be held at the Fulton Country Club, and that McMillen would be allowed to attend with her girlfriend.&lt;ref name="nemsprom"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://nems360.com/view/full_story/6891294/article-Itawamba-prom-off--then-on-again |title=Itawamba prom off, then on again |author=Chris Kieffer and Alisha Wilson |work=[[Northeast Mississippi Daily Journal]] |date=March 31, 2010 |accessdate=April 1, 2010 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5okL1sJFR?url=http://nems360.com/view/full_story/6891294/article-Itawamba-prom-off--then-on-again |archivedate=April 4, 2010 |deadurl=yes |df=mdy-all }} Archived at&lt;/ref&gt;

McMillen said she took that answer as a "no" in regards to her question on whether or not she was invited and details about the secret private prom were kept from her.&lt;ref name="nems360"/&gt;

Students who attended the "Evergreen" prom posted photos of the event on their Facebook pages, but many of the photos were deleted after they became public. Some students said the event was not a prom but was instead a birthday party, while others said it was just a private party. However, while claiming the event was not a prom publicly, students uploaded photos from the event to their Facebook pages labeled as "Prom 2010" and posted status updates which referred to the gathering as "prom".&lt;ref name="inquisitr"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.inquisitr.com/69069/constance-mcmillen-fake-prom-confirmed/ |title=Followup: Constance McMillen’s classmates confirm prom ruse, the fact that they’re bigoted |author=Kim LaCapria |publisher=The Inquisitr |accessdate=April 7, 2010 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt; |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100411042852/http://www.inquisitr.com/69069/constance-mcmillen-fake-prom-confirmed/ |archivedate=April 11, 2010 |deadurl=no |df=mdy }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="sun"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.torontosun.com/news/world/2010/04/07/13501391.html|title=Students send lesbian to decoy prom|author=QMI Agency|work=Toronto Sun | date= April 7, 2010 | accessdate=April 12, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="theweek"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://theweek.com/article/index/201598/Mississippi_outrage_Fake_proms_for_lesbians|title=Mississippi outrage: 'Fake proms' for lesbians|author=Editorial board |publisher=The Week Magazine | date= April 7, 2010 | accessdate=April 12, 2010| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20100412014744/http://theweek.com/article/index/201598/Mississippi_Outrage_Fake_proms_for_lesbians| archivedate= April 12, 2010 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="cbscrimesider"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cbsnews.com/8301-504083_162-20001910-504083.html|title=Constance McMillen faces Facebook Backlash as her Classmates Ridicule her Online|author=Carlin DeGuerin Miller |publisher=CBS News | date= April 7, 2010 | accessdate=April 12, 2010| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20100411200643/http://www.cbsnews.com/8301-504083_162-20001910-504083.html| archivedate= April 11, 2010 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Arabic [[Shiite]] reform journal '''''al-ʿIrfān''''' ([[Arabic language|Arabic]]: العرفان; [[Deutsche Morgenländische Gesellschaft|DMG]]: al-ʿIrfān; [[English language|English]]: "Knowledge") was founded in Beirut by Aḥmad ʿĀrif az-Zain (1884-1960) in 1909. From 1910 the publication was transferred to a special printing house in [[Saida, Lebanon|Saida]], South Lebanon. Az-Zain, who had worked before for different magazines, among others Ṯamarāt al-funūn (1875-1908), was in charge until 1960. Together with [[Ahmad Rida|Aḥmad Riḍā]] (1872-1953) and Sulaimān Ẓāhir (1873-1960) he initiated a new stage of [[Nahda|Nahḍa]] with this encyclopedic educational journal in South Lebanon.&lt;ref&gt;Dagmar Glaß: Der al-Muqtaṭaf und seine Öffentlichkeit. Aufklärung, Räsonnement und Meinungsstreit in der frühen arabischen Zeitschriftenkommunikation, Band I, Würzburg 2004, p. 140ff.&lt;/ref&gt;

The subtitle ("maǧalla ʿilmīya, adabīya, aḫlāqīya, iǧtimāʿīya") explains clearly that al-ʿIrfān was a journal for science, literature, morals and social issues.&lt;ref&gt;al-ʿIrfān, 1st Volume, 1st Issue, 1909.&lt;/ref&gt; Moreover, in the preface of the first edition it was formulated that no political or controverse religious articles should be published.&lt;ref&gt;al-ʿIrfān, 1st Volume, 1st Issue, 1909, p. 1-3.&lt;/ref&gt; Its stated objectives were to create a suitable educational institution for a broader audience that should guarantee the well-being of the public and serve the progress. As South Lebanon was not included in this process yet, the editor wanted to take this initiative by founding al-ʿIrfān.&lt;ref&gt;al-ʿIrfān, 1st Volume, 1st Issue, 1909, p. 1-3.&lt;/ref&gt;

From 1910/1911 the range of content was extended. Articles on technical progress and new inventions, on Shiite history as well as on women’s topics such as upbringing and emancipation were now included. Numerous illustrations should give the journal a modern look and maybe to address those who could not read.&lt;ref&gt;Silvia Naef: Aufklärung in einem schiitischen Umfeld: Die libanesische Zeitschrift al-ʿIrfān. In: Die Welt des Islams (1996), Vol. 36,3, p. 365-378.&lt;/ref&gt; From 1922/1923 on an additional page with jokes and anecdotes was published to address a wider audience. Topics such as rights, freedom and democracy were gradually taken up.

Al-ʿIrfān wanted to be, in contrast to other model-journals like ''[[Al-Muqtataf (magazine)|al-Muqtataf]]'' and ''[[Al-Hilal (magazine)|al-Hilal]]'', a mouthpiece for the religious groups of Arabic Shiites.&lt;ref&gt;Dagmar Glaß: Der al-Muqtaṭaf und seine Öffentlichkeit. Aufklärung, Räsonnement und Meinungsstreit in der frühen arabischen Zeitschriftenkommunikation, Band I, Würzburg 2004, p. 140ff.&lt;/ref&gt; This was explicitly shown, i. e. in the cover of the 5th year, with the addition šuʿūn aš-šīʿa („concerns of the [[Shia]]“).&lt;ref&gt;al-ʿIrfān, 5th Volume, 1913/14.&lt;/ref&gt; 90% of the subscribers were Shiites from [[Lebanon]], [[Iraq]], [[Bahrain]], [[Kuwait]] and other countries.&lt;ref&gt;Silvia Naef: La presse en tant que moteur du renouveau culturel et littéraire: La revue chiite libanaise Al-ʿIrfān, in: Asiatische Studien/Études Asiatiques L (1996), 2, (Literatur und Wirklichkeit – Littérature et Réalités), p. 385-397.&lt;/ref&gt; Az-Zain considered himself a reformer, who understands the Islamic world as a cultural and not only as a religious unit.&lt;ref&gt;Silvia Naef: Aufklärung in einem schiitischen Umfeld: Die libanesische Zeitschrift al-ʿIrfān. In: Die Welt des Islams (1996), Vol. 36,3, p. 375.&lt;/ref&gt;

Objectives and content of the journal changed over time. Instead of spreading progress and enlightenment, other current and political topics became predominant.

After the independence of Lebanon in 1943 the thematic focus was more and more on the rights of Shiites in Lebanon. Az-Zain's son Nizar took over the management of the journal after his father’s death in 1960, which now published mainly literature topics. After Nizar's death in 1981 the publication was handed over to his nephew Fuʿād az-Zain.

A disaster management training workshop was conducted for the Nandurbar police force on the invitation of the Superintendent of Police – [[Nandurbar]], Maharashtra.

==Vermiculture Project ==

AADM considers soil [[Fertility (soil)|fertility]] and environmental protection as the two key aspects of disaster management (prevention section). AADM achieves these by adopting to vermiculture which is an eco-friendly waste management technology.

It is the technology of rearing or cultivating [[earthworms]] and using them as natural bio reactors in [[waste management]]. It is a simple procedure of maintaining and culturing earthworms that feed on the [[biodegradable waste]], defaces and multiply on wastes.

It can handle all types of [[biodegradation|bio-degradable]] waste like food waste, floral and vegetable waste, garden waste, cow dung and paper waste. The non vegetarian food items can also be used. However they take longer time to [[decompose]] which could produce poor smell. The dry waste like glass, thermocol, plastic, rubber or likewise which does not decompose cannot be used in the process.

It also helps to protect the earthworm species which plays an important role in soil fertility and environment protection.

It can be practiced in cities and villages or farms. In cities, the citizens should show active participation to overcome the alarming state of the environment. It can be carried out near cow sheds, backyards, basements or any suitable place which can be well protected. Unlike cities, villages have a wider scope for adopting Vermiculture&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Indian Express |url=https://aniruddhafoundation.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/AniruddhaFoundation-Indian-Express_18May_AADM.jpg |website=aniruddhafoundation.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; with all the necessary resources easily available and in abundance.

[[File:Large pit option.jpg|thumb| left | Large pit option for Vermiculture]]
[[File:Large pit option1.jpg|thumb Large pit option for Vermiculture |thumbnail|center|Large pit option for Vermiculture]]

===Large scale===
'''Salient features:'''

•	Large quantities of waste can be converted to [[Vermicompost]] which would otherwise be burned (garden waste) or piled into dumping grounds or other natural bodies

•	The process is practically free from foul odor &amp; generates little heat which can be easily controlled.

•	Construction of pits &amp; shade can be made according to the geographic location and climatic conditions of the area. Hence Capital for the project can be tailored to suit the budget bracket.

•	Ideally a dedicated manpower of four can handle an entire project.

•	Requires 1-1½ hour of field work in the morning &amp; evening in the initial stage. later on when the pits are fully dumped with waste, it requires less time to monitor parameters such as pH &amp; temperature.

•	The first output of rich Vermicompost takes 2-2½ months but the second cycle is completed within 45 days. As number of worms increase the quality &amp; quantity of manure increases.

'''Key process requirements:'''

•	Availability of space - may vary depending on the quantity of waste but 500 sq. ft. is typically sufficient

•	Availability of water &amp; electricity nearby

'''Raw material requirements:'''

•	Easily available bedding material like paddy straw, [[coconut palms]], coconut choirs and sugarcane bagasse.

•	Supply of [[cow dung]] (either dry decomposed or at least 15 days old) as a primary source of food for earthworms. Wet cow dung if available abundantly can be stored or stacked.

===Small scale (house level)===

The individuals can practice this technology at the household level. The salient features are

•	It can be done in a small plastic bucket, tray or earthen pots.

•	It is economical and the procedure too is very simple.

•	One can devote time according to one’s suitability.

•	It can be practiced by people of all ages.

The derived [[Vermicompost]] and vermiwash can be used to create small balcony plants, terrace gardens&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Lokprabha|url=https://aniruddhafoundation.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/AniruddhaFoundation-Lokprabha-Artical-Vermiculture-25-7-2005.jpg |website=aniruddhafoundation.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;, tree saplings etc.
'''Key success factors:'''

•	Bedding - Selection of proper bedding material like paddy straw, sugarcane baggasse or coconut coirs is a key.

•	Food source - The bio-degradable waste (kitchen waste, floral waste, agro waste, cow dung and paper)

•	Adequate moisture – The bedding used should be able to hold sufficient moisture. The earthworms breathe through their skin and so moisture content is very crucial for their existence.

•	Adequate aeration - Worms are oxygen breathers and cannot survive anaerobic conditions. They operate best when ventilation is good and the material they are living is porous and well aerated.

•	Protection from extreme temperature - The temperature control is essential for the process and requires near about room temperature of 25 to 28 degrees ideally.

The other important parameters are [[pH]], salt content and proper shelter.

'''Benefits'''

•	As the biodegradable garbage is disposed off through the [[vermiculture]] process, there is less pollution of natural resources through garbage

•	Open lands and play grounds being turned into dumping grounds can be avoided.

•	Outbreak of diseases can be minimized.

•	Soil fertility deterioration can be reduced by using natural fertilizers instead of [[chemical fertilizer]]s/ [[pesticide]]s.

•	Destruction of the significant soil Eco-system can be reduced.

•	The biggest disaster for the farmers viz. decline in farm productivity can be minimized.

•	Pollution through food chain can be minimized which is highly destructive for plants animals and humankind.

•	The water holding capacity of [[Vermicompost]] is many times more as compared to chemical fertilizers. This increases the water retention capacity of the soil preventing soil erosion.

•	The production of plants and crops is of a very god quality in terms of color, size, taste and quality.

AADM formed a core team of 50 volunteers for a full-fledged training in the pilot project. The core team started the project at household level with an initial seed provided by the Academy to get the practical knowledge of the project and develop as a trainer’s team. “Train the trainer” approach was used.

[[File:Vermiculture.jpg|thumb | Pilot Project at VJTI]]

'''Pilot project at [[VJTI]] campus (Mumbai):'''

•	The first pilot project was set up at VJTI campus (Mumbai) using their cafeteria and garden waste.
 
•	The project was implemented and looked after by the Academy’s core team of volunteers.

•	A large pit was built using the service of the volunteers.

'''Consultancy projects:'''

AADM also offers consultancy to various housing societies, corporate, schools and colleges.  Under consultancy, a team of volunteers from the Academy visit the site for survey, and submit a survey report thereafter to cater the requirements for the project execution.  The people handling the projects are trained by the Academy’s team by personal visits till the first crop of Vermicompost is harvested Thereafter it is the sole responsibility of the society or institution to continue the project in the long run.
	
Consultancy for vermiculture was provided to the various Educational Institutes, Govt. organizations like

•	Pearl Society - Vile Parle      
                     
•	[[NABARD]]

'''Project awareness:'''

Upon request from schools and colleges, introduction and demonstrations have been given to students. 
The demonstrations have been conducted through power point presentations, display charts and practicals. The students are encouraged to maintain a small scale vermiculture bin which can be rated by the teachers as a part of the school project.

'''Key awareness projects'''

Awareness through lecture and demonstrations in 24 wards of [[MCGM]]-Education Dept. for school children, parents, staff teachers, gardeners and CDO (Community Development Officers) covering around 200 schools. for such programs were conducted half-yearly during Feb.’05 to Dec.’06.

'''Future for vermiculture in India'''

Till date 87 tons of Vermicompost has been produced from the academy’s own projects in Mumbai and Maharashtra region and has been utilized for tree plantation. That amounts to approx. 340 tons of waste conversion into Vermicompost.

''Vermiculture is an '''eco-friendly waste management technology'''. It is definitely cost effective and can be implemented in urban and rural areas. It is easy to practice and helps us curb air, water and land pollutions. ‘Trees’ are considered as living immovable souls. By supplying them with good fertilizers and water, we are not only nurturing them but also trying to repay the obligation of our Mother Earth in a small and righteous way.
''

BMF was among the first organizations in China to commission new works by Chinese composers as well as foreign composers, which has laid a strong base for international cultural exchange.

==Commissions==
In commemoration of its 10th anniversary, BMF commissioned a second version of [[Krzysztof Penderecki]]'s Symphony No. 8. The new version included an anonymous 15th-century Chinese poem and is 30 minutes longer than the original work. The commissioned version premiered on October 24, 2007 by the [[China Philharmonic Orchestra]] under the baton of its composer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=10th Beijing Music Festival|url=http://www.bmf.org.cn/en/history_10_5.html|website=Beijing Music Festival|accessdate=23 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Based on the Chinese [[legend of the White Snake]], the work was premiered in [[Boston]] by [[Opera Boston]] on February 26, 2010 and then in China on October 27, 2010 during the 13th Beijing Music Festival.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Tsioulcas|first1=Anastasia|title=Madame White Snake|url=http://www.wqxr.org/#!/story/13971-madame-white-snake/|website=WQXR|accessdate=23 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The BMF Arts Foundation commissioned [[Howard Shore]]'s ''Ruin and Memory'', a concerto for piano and orchestra written for and premiered by [[Lang Lang]] with the [[China Philharmonic]] conducted by [[Long Yu]] on October 11, 2010. The three-movement work was written in celebration of [[Frederic Chopin]]'s 200th anniversary. Shore commented "The piece is really my musical reflection of Chopin's time and the life he lived. The title captures a bit of Chopin's life, about where he came from and the world he lived in, and what became of him when that world no longer existed." &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Howard Shore’s Ruin and Memory Premiered by Lang Lang at the Beijing Music Festival|url=http://www.schott-music.com/news/archive/show,4865.html|archive-url=https://archive.is/20150310003809/http://www.schott-music.com/news/archive/show,4865.html|dead-url=yes|archive-date=10 March 2015|website=Schott Music|accessdate=31 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

BMF commissioned the opera, ''Song of Farewell'' by [[Ye Xiaogang]], and gave the world premiere during the closing concerts of the 13th festival, October 30 and 31, 2010. The work fuses [[Peking Opera]] and Western Opera with its traditional Chinese staging and [[Puccini]]-like score. The work is based on the Chinese film ''[[Farewell My Concubine (film)|Farewell My Concubine]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Fabius|first1=Charles|title=Beijing Music Festival 2010: China’s Future in Performing Arts|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/charles-fabius/beijing-music-festival-20_1_b_780120.html|website=Huffington Post}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''blue star tattoo legend''' states that a temporary lick-and-stick tattoo soaked in [[Lysergic acid diethylamide|LSD]] and made in the form of a blue star, or of popular children's cartoon characters, is being distributed to children in the area in order to get them 'addicted to LSD'.

==Propagation==
It commonly surfaces in [[United States|American]] [[elementary school|elementary]] and [[middle school]]s in the form of a [[Flyer (pamphlet)|flyer]] which is distributed to parents by concerned school officials. In the past it was often in the form of poor quality photocopy, clearly many generations old, but it has now also become popular on Internet mailing lists and websites. 

The legend states that a temporary lick-and-stick tattoo soaked in [[Lysergic acid diethylamide|LSD]] and made in the form of a blue star (the logo of the [[Dallas Cowboys]] is often mentioned), or of popular children's cartoon characters, such as [[Mickey Mouse]] and [[Bart Simpson]], is being distributed to children in the area in order to get them 'addicted to LSD'; even though LSD is rarely addictive&lt;ref &gt;{{Cite news|url=http://hallucinogens.com/lsd-acid/is-lsd-addictive/|title=Is LSD Addictive?|work=Hallucinogens.com|access-date=2017-09-01|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;. 

Generally some attribution is given, (typically to a well-regarded hospital or a vaguely specified "advisor to the president"),&lt;ref name=snopes/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Arax |first1=Mark |title=Flyer Says Drug Is in Rub-On Tattoos : LSD Warning Spreads Panic |url=http://articles.latimes.com/1987-12-09/local/me-18262_1_drug-tattoos |accessdate=9 October 2018 |work=Los Angeles Times |date=9 December 1987}}&lt;/ref&gt; and instructions are given that parents should contact police if they come across the blue star tattoos.

==Origin==
The legend possibly originated from the fact that an LSD solution is sometimes [[LSD#Forms|sold on blotter paper]] with various designs, including cartoons.&lt;ref name=harold&gt;{{cite news |last1=Brunvand |first1=Harold |title=Hoax of the LSD Tattoos Has a Long History |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1988/12/24/opinion/l-hoax-of-the-lsd-tattoos-has-a-long-history-197588.html |accessdate=9 October 2018 |work=The New York Times |date=24 December 1988}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

No actual cases of LSD distribution to children in this manner have been documented. Furthermore, LSD does not penetrate through skin in sufficient quantities so as to induce a psychedelic experience.

==Other countries==
The legend has surfaced in many other places, including:
* Brazil
* Italy
* Peru&lt;ref name=harold/&gt;
* Mexico
* Portugal
* UK&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Drugs scare over kids' fake tattoos |url=https://www.louthleader.co.uk/news/drugs-scare-over-kids-fake-tattoos-1-1012137 |accessdate=9 October 2018 |date=16 November 2001}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Carabram''' is an annual multi-cultural festival in [[Brampton, Ontario]], founded in 1982.

The festival was founded after volunteers from different ethnic communities wanted to organize a festival celebrating diversity and cross-cultural friendship.  With a name based on a similar Toronto event, the [[Caravan Festival of Cultures]], Carabram's first event included Italian, Scottish, Ukrainian, and West Indian pavilions.  By 2003, forty-five-thousand visitors visited 18 pavilions. Canada itself had an anchor pavilion in the late-1980s and early-1990s, but ceased when it failed to get sponsorship.

[[Brampton Transit]] runs a free service connecting the pavilions, for people presenting a ticket to the festival.

== Pavilions ==
Countries, continents, states and geographic or cultural regions that have been represented at Carabram through the years include [[Africa]], [[Arab world|Arab]] (dubbed "Arabian"), [[Canada]], [[Caribbean]]*, [[China]], [[Croatia]], [[Chile]], [[England]], [[Germany]]*, [[Greece]], [[Hawaii]]*, [[Hispanic]], the [[Netherlands]], [[India]]*, [[Ireland]]*, [[Israel]], [[Italy]]*, [[Republic of Macedonia|Macedonia]]*, [[Mexico]], [[Myanmar]]*, [[Pakistan]]*, [[Philippines]]*, [[Poland]]*, [[Portugal]], [[Romania]], and [[Ukraine]]*. Those pavilions marked with asterisks were part of the 2006 festivities.

The '''cult of the offensive''' refers to a strategic military dilemma, where leaders believe that [[First strike|offensive advantages are so great]] that a defending force would have no hope of repelling the attack; consequently, all states choose to attack. It is most often used in the context of explaining the [[causes of World War I]] and the subsequent heavy losses that occurred year after year, on all sides, during the fighting on the [[Western Front (World War I)|Western Front]].

The term has also been applied to those considering air power doctrine immediately prior to the opening of [[World War II]], where it was believed "[[the bomber will always get through]]" and the only way to end a bombing campaign was to bomb the enemy into submission. It is also often used to explain Israeli strategy during the 1960s and 1970s,{{by whom|date=May 2014}} as demonstrated in the [[Six-Day War]] in which Israeli forces attacked and routed much larger enemy forces in a lightning attack.

==Military theory==
Under the cult of offensive, military leaders believe that the attacker will be victorious (or at least cause more casualties than they receive) regardless of circumstance and so defense as a concept is almost completely discredited. This results in all strategies focusing on attacking, and the only valid defensive strategy being to counter-attack.

==International politics==
In [[international relations]], the cult of offensive is related to the [[security dilemma]] and [[offensive realism]] theories. It stresses that conquest is easy and security difficult to obtain from a defensive posture. Liberal institutionalists argue that it is a commitment problem&lt;ref&gt;Powell, Robert. 2006. "War as a Commitment Problem." {{cite web |url=http://polisci.ucsd.edu/~bslantch/courses/pdf/powell-io2005.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2008-07-27 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060907082924/http://polisci.ucsd.edu/~bslantch/courses/pdf/powell-io2005.pdf |archivedate=2006-09-07 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; and that a [[preemptive war]] that results from the security dilemma is fairly rare.&lt;ref&gt;Reiter, Dan. 1995. "Exploding the Powder Keg Myth: Preemptive Wars Almost Never Happen." {{JSTOR|2539227}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==World War I==
The cult of the offensive was the dominant theory among many military and political leaders before [[World War I]].&lt;ref&gt;Snyder, Jack L., ''The Ideology of the Offensive: Military Decision Making and the Disasters of 1914'', Ithaca: Cornell University Press, 1984&lt;/ref&gt; Those leaders argued in favor of declaring war and launching an offensive, believing they could cripple their opponents, and fearing that if they waited, they in turn would be defeated. The dominance of this line of thought significantly contributed to the escalation of hostilities, and is seen as one of the [[causes of World War I]].

Military theorists of the time generally held that seizing the offensive was of crucial importance, hence belligerents were encouraged to strike first in order to gain the advantage.&lt;ref&gt;Azar Gat, ''The Development of Military Thought: The Nineteenth Century'', Oxford: Clarendon Press, 1992&lt;/ref&gt; Most planners wanted to begin [[mobilization]] as quickly as possible to avoid being caught on the defensive. This was complicated as mobilizations were expensive, and their schedules were so rigid that they could not be canceled without massive disruption of the country and military disorganization. Thus, the window for [[diplomacy]] was shortened by this attitude, and once the mobilizations had begun diplomacy had the added difficulty of having to justify cancelling the mobilizations. This phenomenon was also referred to as "war by timetable".&lt;ref&gt;Taylor, A. J. P., ''War by Time-Table: How the First World War Began'', London: Macdonald &amp; Co., 1969&lt;/ref&gt;

The German [[Schlieffen Plan]] is a notable example of the cult of the offensive. Supported by offensively-minded officers such as [[Alfred von Schlieffen]] and [[Helmuth von Moltke the Younger]], it was executed in the first month of the war (with some historians maintaining it was nearly victorious,&lt;ref&gt;Dupuy, Trevor N, ''A Genius for War: the German Army and General Staff, 1807-1945'', Englewood Cliffs, NJ: Prentice-Hall, 1977&lt;/ref&gt; though others claim the Plan never had any chance of success.{{sfn|Ritter|1958|pp=1–194}}) A French counter-attack on the outskirts of Paris, the [[First Battle of the Marne|Battle of the Marne]] and unexpectedly speedy Russian mobilisation and attacks, ended the German offensive and resulted in years of [[trench warfare]]. It was not only Germany who followed the cult of the offensive; the French army, among others, was also driven very strongly by this doctrine, where its supporters included [[Ferdinand Foch]], [[Joseph Joffre]] and [[Loyzeaux de Grandmaison]]. Officers of that period were indoctrinated that "The French Army, returning unto its traditions, no longer knows any law other than the offensive." This is thought{{by whom|date=May 2014}} to be the military reason behind the French Conscription Law in July 1913, following the passing of a similar bill in Germany six months earlier: the offensive "guerre à outrance" swiftly to seize [[Alsace-Lorraine]] was felt by military planners to require an additional 200,000 conscripts with respect to the defensive war for which the army was prepared.{{citation needed|date=May 2014}}

World War I was dominated by defensive firepower but the onus on the Entente was to conduct an offensive strategy, that caused mass casualties and mutual exhaustion. German armies prepared elaborate defensive positions on the western front with [[Trench warfare|trenches]], barbed wire and concrete strong-points backed by [[artillery]], [[rifle]]s and [[machine gun]]s which until 1917, were sufficient to inflict mass losses on attacking [[infantry]] and restrict the Franco-British armies to minor gains in ground. [[Tactical development on the Western Front in 1917]] began to return mobility to the battlefield and a form of semi-open warfare developed. Much inter-war military thinking was influenced by the cost of offensives fought for strategic reasons, in circumstances of defensive operational and tactical dominance. In World War II, the [[Allies of World War II|Western Allies]] from 1939–1940 avoided an offensive, intending to wait until Franco-British rearmament had matured and the blockade of Germany had undermined its war economy, then in 1941 or 1942, resume the firepower warfare of 1918.

'''''Forced Entry''''' is a 2002 [[pornographic film]] written and directed by [[Lizzy Borden (actress)|Lizzy Borden]], produced by [[Rob Zicari]], and released by [[Extreme Associates]]. The film is loosely based on the crimes of [[California]] serial killer [[Richard Ramirez]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.rogreviews.com/27099/interview-lizzy-borden/|title = Lizzy Borden Interview|last = Pipe|first = Roger|publisher = Rog Reviews|date = 1 March 2001|website = rogreviews.com|accessdate = 7 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;
== Plot ==
A man knocks on a teenage girl's door, claiming to be in need of directions. When the girl leaves to answer the phone, the man sneaks in and grabs her when she returns. Physically and verbally assaulting the girl, the man drags her into a bedroom by the neck and rapes her. Tracking the killer is obnoxious Channel 5 Action News reporter Roberto Negro, who has been receiving taunting letters from the murderer. The killer and two accomplices (one of them initially reluctant) attack a pregnant housewife, filming themselves pummeling and raping her at gunpoint. When the trio finishes, they shoot the woman and her dog. Roberto reports on the housewife's death, and while the authorities refuse to confirm there is a serial killer on the loose, Roberto is convinced there is.

Spotting a woman having car trouble, the killer and his partners pull up in their van, force her into the vehicle and take her to their hideout. The woman is filmed being abused, raped and stabbed. An envelope containing a knife, a gun and another note is sent to Roberto and the police acquire clues from these items. Another package, this one containing a VHS tape, is dropped off at Roberto's office. The tape is a tribute to the killer, showing two of his fans brutalizing and sexually assaulting a woman. Roberto recognizes one of the [[Copycat crime|copycats]] as a gas station attendant, whom the police arrests. Elsewhere, two men recognize the serial killer when he walks by them on the street and chase him, being joined by several others. The killer is cornered in an alleyway, and beat and stabbed to death. Roberto finds the man's body and kicks it twice before walking away.

== Reception ==
{{Main article|United States v. Extreme Associates}}
The crew of the television series ''[[Frontline (U.S. TV series)|Frontline]]'' stormed off in disgust while visiting the set of the film for their documentary ''American Porn''. The incident led to the ''[[United States v. Extreme Associates]]'' obscenity trial.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.salon.com/2002/06/20/lizzy_borden/|title = Porn provocateur|last = Brown|first = Janelle|publisher = Salon|date = 20 June 2002|website = salon.com|accessdate = 25 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Paul Fishbein, president of [[AVN (magazine)|AVN]], referred to ''Forced Entry'' and the rest of the Extreme Associates library as "horrible, unwatchable, disgusting, aberrant movies".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://abcnews.go.com/Nightline/Business/Story?id=433956|title = Court Deals Blow to U.S. Anti-Porn Campaign|last = Tapper|first = Jake|publisher = ABC Nightline|date = 25 January 2005|website = abcnews.go.com|accessdate = 27 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''[[The Village Voice]]'' stated the film is "The most violent porno I've seen. It's both shocking and completely banal" while Adult FYI wrote "It's brutal. More than that, it's terribly evil.

It is a shame that these very talented people would waste their time on this. Can you imagine the good stuff they could be doing?" &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.cavr.com/xxx10108.htm|title = ''Forced Entry''|last = Aarle|first = Peter|publisher = Cyberspace Adult Video Reviews|date = 20 April 2002|website = cavr.com|accessdate = 27 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Forced Entry'' was described as "a disturbing piece of hardcore, made by and for some very disturbed people" by Recarts Movies Erotica, which said that while the acting was good and it succeeded in creating physical and sexual tension, it suffered from cheesy effects and editing, inconsistent camerawork, and poor production values.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.rame.net/reviews/misc/4302.html|title = Extreme Associates' ''Forced Entry''|last = D|first = Jimmy|publisher = Recarts Movies Erotica|date = 22 March 2002|website = rame.net|accessdate = 27 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Adult Industry News decried ''Forced Entry'' as a borderline [[snuff film]], writing "promoting violence and/or making (or trying to make) rape look sexy is very disturbing" and "movies like this are more than controversial, they are bad for the adult film business".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://ainews.com/Archives/Story4518.phtml|title = ''Forced Entry'' - Reviewer Rated...|last = Whett, Cohen|first = Nina, Scott|publisher = Adult Industry News|date = 26 May 2002|website = ainews.com|accessdate = 18 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Academic Eugenie Brinkema has written extensively on the film, its content and its reception in an article called 'Rough Sex'.&lt;ref&gt;Brinkema, Eugenie. 2014. ‘Rough Sex’.

'''Fuck for the Heir Puppy Bear!''' ({{lang-rus|Ебись за наследника Медвежонка|r=Yebis' za naslednika Medvezhonka}}) was political-artistic performance staged by Russian performance group [[Voina]] at the Timiryazev State Biological Museum in [[Moscow]] in February 2008.

==Performance==
On February 23, as a prelude to the event, members of Voina showed up at a meeting of the [[Young Guard of United Russia]] and displayed a white banner with the slogan "Fuck for the Heir Puppy Bear".&lt;ref name="Young Guard video"&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JAdLmqOcA70 Video of Voina showing the banner "Fuck for the heir Puppy Bear" at the meeting of Young Guards of United Russia]&lt;/ref&gt;

On February 28, almost twenty people assembled in the Moscow Biological Museum. Five couples undressed in the museum hall "Metabolism and Energy of Organisms", and engaged in sexual intercourse&lt;ref&gt;http://www.henrikaeshna.com/apps/blog/sex-orgy-in-a-museum-what-does&lt;/ref&gt; next to a glass [[taxidermy]] display case which contained a stuffed bear.&lt;ref name="Performance video" /&gt; Participants included Vera Kondakova (from Ukraine), Alexandre Karpenko (from Ukraine), as well as other well known Voina members.

The performance was a protest of the election of [[Dmitry Medvedev]] in the 2008 [[Russian presidential election, 2008|Russian presidential election]]. It took place in front of a black flag with a slogan reading: "Fuck for the heir Puppy Bear!".&lt;ref name="Performance video"&gt;[http://www.liveleak.com/view?i=a4d_1204458756 Performance video.]&lt;/ref&gt; The title "Puppy Bear" is a play on words referring to Medvedev, whose last name derives from the Russian word ''medved'', "[[bear]]".

The Voina's performance was photographed and videotaped by several spectators invited by the group. It was also described and photographically illustrated online, by Russian [[lexicographer]] and [[blog]]ger Alexei Plutser-Sarno, who himself participated in the action.&lt;ref name="Plucer blog"&gt;[http://plucer.livejournal.com/55710.html Original account of the performance in Plucer-Sarno blog.]&lt;/ref&gt; Photos of the performance were also published by blogger adolfych.&lt;ref name="adolfych photos"&gt;[http://adolfych.livejournal.com/1154454.html Performance photos published by blogger adolfych] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090531013828/http://adolfych.livejournal.com/1154454.html |date=2009-05-31 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Following these blog reports, the action was covered by the media and met with mostly conservative responses in Russian society.

On March 3, Voina reappeared with the same slogan and marched with the banner "I fuck the heir Puppy Bear" at the [[Dissenters March]] in [[St. Petersburg]].&lt;ref name="Dissenters March video"&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xUbRqswNRSA Video showing the banner "I fuck the puppy bear" at the Dissenters March]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Performance goals==
The performance was announced as a ritual for the bear [[totem]]. Plucer-Sarno explained the reason for the action was "We do not have a goal to necessarily be radical instigators. We have a goal to be honest artists and tell what we think. We think that the government fucks the people, and the people like this. This is why the action 'Fuck for the heir Puppy Bear' was born".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.day.kiev.ua/290619?idsource=277850&amp;mainlang=rus Dmitry Desyaterik. Moscow art-group Voina as protest art in pure form.] Den, Kiev, 31 July 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; He also said in the same interview that "This is a portrait of pre-election Russia: everybody fucks each other, and the puppy bear looks at that with an unconcealed scorn".

Plucer-Sarno published in his blog a commentary by artist Maria Perchikhina that described the performance as an "act of [[subversive affirmation]]".&lt;ref name="Perchikhina"&gt;[http://plucer.livejournal.com/60121.html Act of subversive affirmation: Artist Maria Perchikhina on the action "Fuck for the heir Puppy Bear"]&lt;/ref&gt; According to this opinion, the stuffed bear symbolizes the Russian political system, termed "imitation democracy" by Dmitry Furman, and turns into the figure of the "chosen chief bear". The goal of the action then, following the analogy of archaic fertility rituals, is birth assistance for the new political system. The ideas of fertility and reproduction along with the national idea form the core of the new political system. The single transgressive feature in the performance was the publicity of sexual activity. Perchikhina interpreted that transgressive feature as [[subversive affirmation]], in other words, a resistance to the system by outperforming it (similar to "trying to be a better catholic than the Pope"). She also quoted an article by Inke Arns and Sylvia Sasse where the principle of subversive affirmation was explained.&lt;ref name="Arns and Sasse, 2006"&gt;[http://www.projects.v2.nl/~arns/Texts/Media/Arns-Sasse-EAM-final.pdf Inke Arns and Sylvia Sasse. Subversive Affirmation. On Mimesis as Strategy of Resistance. In: Irwin: East Art Map, London / Ljubljana 2005]&lt;/ref&gt;

Political science expert Ilya Prokudin commented that the action was clearly political: "The action in the Zoological museum had a political character. It was dedicated to the newly baked (we should not call him newly elected, who elected him?) puppy president, Medvedev, and mocked one of the '[[National Priority Projects|national projects]]' curated by him, namely 'on the increase in birth rate'. For the least apprehensive, even a pregnant woman ('[[Nadezhda Tolokonnikova]]')&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hipsterrunoff.com/altreport/2012/08/nsfw-nude-orgy-pregnancy-photos-hot-girl-pussy-riot.html Pictures from the "Act"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121010021138/http://www.hipsterrunoff.com/altreport/2012/08/nsfw-nude-orgy-pregnancy-photos-hot-girl-pussy-riot.html |date=2012-10-10 }} Hipster Runoff, 20 Aug 2012&lt;/ref&gt; was part of the scene.

==Response to performance==
=== Faculty of Philosophy ===

One of the performers in phone interview with internet news agency Lenta.ru said that a student was expelled from the Faculty of Philosophy of [[Moscow State University|MSU]] for participating in the action. However, the Dean of the Faculty, V.V. Mironov, stated that two or three students had been expelled long before the performance for poor grades.&lt;ref&gt;[http://lenta.ru/news/2008/03/04/noexpel/ MSU students were not recognized among the participants of group sex.] lenta.ru March 4, 2008&lt;/ref&gt; Mironov condemned such performances and claimed that the majority of MSU students share his negative opinion.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rian.ru/society/20080306/100855433.html Scientific council will determine the fate of MSU students who participated in the museum orgy.] .rian.ru March 6, 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

An unnamed organization gathered a collection of signatures under a document that condemned the performance. However, an alternative group collected signatures in favor of the performance.{{Citation needed|date=March 2010}}

===Media response===
====Press and internet====
Generally negative opinions of "Fuck for the heir Puppy Bear!" were published by the media. A number of publications focused on the amoral behavior of the performers. Newspaper [[Komsomolskaya Pravda]] commented: "They are not unrecognized geniuses. They are losers and poseurs acting on the principle: 'come, trash the place, go away'. For the PR, they would dance on a grave, and even take off their panties in public. And they do not care that after such actions innocent people suffer - metro employees, museum keepers. These actions of urban psychos stink very badly."&lt;ref name="Mayantseva"&gt;[https://archive.is/20130417031653/http://www.kp.ru/print/article/24059/302844/ Alexandra Mayantseva. Group sex undertaken in Biological museum.] [[Komsomolskaya Pravda]] March 5, 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

Mikhail Zhukhov, a lawyer from the attorney's collegium "Justice" commented that the performers' actions contained elements of crime described in Article 213, "Hooliganism", of [[Criminal Code of Russia|Russian Criminal Code]]: "The action of the participants severely violated social order. Taking into account the place and the fact that people with photo-cameras and video-cameras were invited, a conclusion can be made about the existence or premeditation. All of this was done by a group of people by a prior arrangement. The participants might face harsh consequences - part 2 of article 213 of Russian Criminal Code makes a provision for a prison sentence for up to seven years. Museum staff should write a report to the Internal Affairs Department".&lt;ref name="Mayantseva" /&gt;

A representative of the foundation for effective politics, Pavel Danilin, called the performers pornographers and jerks and claimed that they had put shame on the Faculty and the University.{{Citation needed|date=March 2010}}

====Radio and television====
{{Unreferenced section|date=March 2010}}
Russian poet Dmitry Volchek, who participated along with Alexei Plucer-Sarno in the [[Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty|Radio Liberty]] program devoted to the performance, claimed that the action had not been radical enough. He had also commented that the essence of conceptual art is in targeting the most vulnerable spot in the subconsciousness. In Volchek's opinion, that spot was accidentally hit by the action, making the stroke so painful.

Television covered the performance in several programs that described Voina's activities.

Videos of the action and of its media coverage can be found on the Internet.

'''''Fun Home''''' is a [[Musical theatre|musical]] adapted by [[Lisa Kron]] and [[Jeanine Tesori]] from [[Alison Bechdel]]'s [[Fun Home|2006 graphic memoir of the same name]]. The story concerns Bechdel's discovery of her own sexuality, her relationship with her gay father, and her attempts to unlock the mysteries surrounding his life. It is the first Broadway musical with a lesbian protagonist.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2015/03/31/fun-home-broadway-_n_6955634.html |title='Fun Home' Brings Lesbian Protagonist To Broadway For The First Time |work=The Huffington Post |date=2015-03-31 |accessdate=2015-05-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is told in a series of non-linear vignettes connected by narration provided by the adult Alison character.

The musical was developed through several readings and performances, including at the [[Ojai Playwrights Conference]] in 2009 and at the [[Sundance Institute#Sundance Theatre Program|Sundance Theatre Lab]] and [[The Public Theater]]'s Public Lab in 2012. It opened [[Off-Broadway]] at the Public Theater in September 2013 to positive reviews. Its run was extended several times, until January 2014. The Public Theater production of ''Fun Home'' was nominated for nine [[Lucille Lortel Awards]] (winning three, including Outstanding Musical), two [[Obie Award]]s and eight [[Drama Desk Award]]s, among others.

The original [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]] production began previews at the [[Circle in the Square Theatre]] in March 2015 and opened in April 2015.&lt;ref name="earlier"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Hetrick|first1=Adam|title=Fun Home Will Arrive on Broadway Earlier Than Expected|url=http://www.playbill.com/news/article/fun-home-will-arrive-on-broadway-earlier-than-expected-336365|website=Playbill|date=December 1, 2014|accessdate=December 8, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was nominated for twelve [[Tony Awards]], winning five, including [[Tony Award for Best Musical|Best Musical]], and its cast album received a nomination for the 2016 [[Grammy Award for Best Musical Theater Album]]. The production closed on September 10, 2016. A US national tour and foreign productions followed.

==Background and development==
Writer/artist [[Alison Bechdel]]'s book ''[[Fun Home]]'', a memoir in comics format, was published in 2006 to [[Fun Home#Reviews and awards|critical acclaim]]. Its subject is Alison Bechdel's [[coming of age]], with particular emphasis on her relationship to her father, Bruce. Bechdel's [[coming out]] as a [[lesbian]] is complicated by the revelation that Bruce was a closeted homosexual whose extra-marital affairs included underage males. Four months after Bechdel comes out to her parents, Bruce is killed by an oncoming truck; although the evidence is equivocal, Bechdel concludes that he committed suicide.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first = George Gene |last = Gustines |authorlink=George Gustines |url = https://www.nytimes.com/2006/06/26/books/26gust.html?ex=1155009600&amp;en=88647dc021a0b412&amp;ei=5070 |format=free registration required  |title = 'Fun Home': A Bittersweet Tale of Father and Daughter |newspaper = [[The New York Times]] |date = June 26, 2006 |accessdate = October 5, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Bechdel's book was adapted into a musical with book and lyrics by [[Lisa Kron]] and music by [[Jeanine Tesori]]. Writing in ''[[Slate (magazine)|Slate]]'', June Thomas called it "the first mainstream musical about a young lesbian".&lt;ref name="thomas_slate"&gt;{{cite web |last=Thomas |first=June |title=Fun Home: Is America Ready for a Musical About a Butch Lesbian? |url=http://www.slate.com/blogs/outward/2013/10/08/fun_home_is_america_ready_for_a_musical_about_a_butch_lesbian.html |work=[[Slate (magazine)|Slate]] |accessdate=18 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The adaptation was developed over the course of five years.&lt;ref name="nyt-bringing"&gt;{{cite news |last=Pogrebin |first=Robin |date=November 20, 2013 |title=Memoir to Musical: Bringing 'Fun Home' to the Stage |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2013/11/21/theater/bringing-fun-home-to-the-stage.html?_r=5&amp;adxnnl=1&amp;smid=tw-share&amp;adxnnlx=1385010756-dO82dZksXI310Erdtr2cwQ&amp; |newspaper=[[New York Times]] |accessdate=December 2, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It was first workshopped at the [[Ojai Playwrights Conference]] in August 2009.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Hetrick |first=Adam |date=August 4, 2009 |title=Ojai Playwrights Conference Begins in CA; Kron and Tesori Pen New Musical |url=http://www.playbill.com/news/article/131641-Ojai-Playwrights-Conference-Begins-in-CA-Kron-and-Tesori-Pen-New-Musical |archive-url=https://archive.is/20131104104324/http://www.playbill.com/news/article/131641-Ojai-Playwrights-Conference-Begins-in-CA-Kron-and-Tesori-Pen-New-Musical |dead-url=yes |archive-date=November 4, 2013 |newspaper=[[Playbill]] |accessdate=November 3, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; A staged reading was performed at [[The Public Theater]] in 2011.&lt;ref name="nyt-bringing" /&gt; (Of the cast of that staged reading, only [[Judy Kuhn]] and [[Beth Malone]] continued in their roles to the full Off-Broadway production.)&lt;ref name="malone_diva"&gt;{{cite news |last=Gans |first=Andrew |date=October 3, 2014 |title=Diva Talk: Beth Malone On Creating a ''Fun Home'' and Becoming an ''Unsinkable Molly Brown'' |url=http://www.playbill.com/news/article/diva-talk-beth-malone-on-creating-a-fun-home-and-becoming-an-unsinkable-molly-brown-331954/P2 |newspaper=[[Playbill]] |accessdate=October 3, 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141205162108/http://www.playbill.com/news/article/diva-talk-beth-malone-on-creating-a-fun-home-and-becoming-an-unsinkable-molly-brown-331954/P2 |archivedate=December 5, 2014 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The musical had another workshop as part of the Sundance Institute's Theater Lab in July 2012, featuring [[Raul Esparza]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Boehm |first=Mike |date=July 10, 2012 |title=Cherry Jones, Raul Esparza give Sundance Theatre Lab star power |url=http://articles.latimes.com/2012/jul/10/entertainment/la-et-cm-cherry-jones-raul-esparza-give-sundance-theatre-lab-star-power-20120709 |newspaper=[[Los Angeles Times]] |accessdate=November 3, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Following that it ran for three weeks as part of the Public Theater's Public Lab series in October and November 2012.&lt;ref&gt;Hetrick, Adam.

The musical's development process entailed extensive changes and rewrites. Beth Malone said that the original workshop script "doesn't resemble this current play at all".&lt;ref name="malone_diva" /&gt; In early versions, the production was structured around Bechdel's drawings, but the creators later removed most of this element, save for one image of Bruce and young Alison which is used at the musical's conclusion.&lt;ref name="nyt-bringing"/&gt; Revisions continued through the preview period of the Off-Broadway production, requiring the actors to perform new material every night.&lt;ref name="nyt-bringing"/&gt;

==Plot summary==
As she works on her memoir in the present day, successful middle-aged cartoonist Alison Bechdel (Alison) recalls two time periods in her life. The first is her childhood, around age 10 (Small Alison), when she struggles against her father Bruce's obsessive demands and begins to identify her inchoate sexuality. The second is her first year in college (Medium Alison), when she begins her first relationship and comes out of the closet as a lesbian. 

Alison remembers herself, as a child, demanding that her father Bruce play "airplane" with her, while he sorts through a box of junk and valuables he has salvaged from a barn ("It All Comes Back"). Bruce tells the family that a visitor from the local historical society is coming to see their ornate Victorian home that he has restored, and his wife Helen prepares the house to Bruce's demanding aesthetic standard ("Welcome to Our House on Maple Avenue"). In a phone call with her father and a journal entry, Medium Alison expresses her anxiety about starting college ("Not Too Bad"). At the Bechdel Funeral Home, Small Alison and her brothers John and Christian perform an imaginary advertisement for the funeral home ("Come to the Fun Home"). Medium Alison hesitates outside the door of the college's Gay Union, and is flummoxed when she meets Joan, a confident young lesbian. Bruce invites into the house Roy, a young man whom he has hired to do yard work. Bruce begins to seduce Roy in the library while Helen is playing the piano upstairs, trying her best to ignore it ("Helen's Etude").

Medium Alison writes a letter to her parents about college life but does not mention Joan or her recent realization that she is a lesbian. Bruce orders Small Alison to put on a dress, but she would rather wear jeans. Bruce tells her that the other children would laugh at her; she reluctantly obeys him ("Party Dress"). Medium Alison proudly tells Joan that she has written a letter to her parents telling them that she is a lesbian, but begins to second-guess herself until Joan kisses her. That night, she is delirious with joy after having had sex with Joan and finally discovering her sexuality ("Changing My Major").

Alison considers the connection between her coming out and her father's death. Small Alison has a homework assignment to draw a map of places her family has lived, but Bruce aggressively takes over, drawing it the way he thinks it should look. Alison realizes that despite having traveled widely, her father's place of birth, life, work and death can all be placed in a small circle in [[Beech Creek, Pennsylvania]] ("Maps"). Bruce offers a ride and a beer to an underage boy, and it is later implied that they had a sexual encounter. Medium Alison writes to her parents, asking for a response to her coming-out letter. Small Alison watches ''[[The Partridge Family]]'', but Bruce angrily switches it off. Small Alison talks to him, and finds out that he is going to see a psychiatrist, but he is ambiguous about the reason. Alison expresses annoyance that he lied to her; the reason he was going was because he was arrested for what he did to the underage boy. Helen attempts to reassure Small Alison that the psychiatrist will help her father, but she too refuses to elaborate. Bruce starts a vicious argument with Helen and breaks several of her possessions along with some library books. Small Alison fantasizes about her family as the happy family singing together on television ("Raincoat of Love").

Alison remembers a time when Bruce took her and her brothers on a trip to New York City. After a long day, Small Alison, Christian and John settle into sleeping bags. Small Alison wakes up and catches Bruce sneaking out. Bruce sings her a lullaby ("Pony Girl"). He reassures his daughter that he's just going out for a paper, but Alison realizes he was probably going cruising. Medium Alison is angered by a noncommittal letter from Bruce responding to her coming out. At a luncheonette with her father, Small Alison notices a butch delivery woman and feels an inexplicable kinship with her ("Ring of Keys").

Medium Alison calls home to demand a better response from her parents and is astonished when her mother reveals that her father has had sexual relationships with men and boys. Alison explores the tensions her family was under at this time and watches a heated argument between her parents. Medium Alison returns home for vacation with Joan. Helen confesses to Medium Alison her troubled and turbulent life with Bruce ("Days and Days"). Medium Alison, Joan and Bruce have an unexpectedly pleasant evening around the piano. Bruce asks Alison if she'd like to go for a drive, and (adult) Alison realizes that Medium Alison is gone; she joins her father in the car, breaking the boundaries of time. On the drive, she and Bruce struggle to express themselves to each other ("Telephone Wire").

Bruce, manically engaged in a new restoration project, tries and fails to find a way to hold his life together. He steps in front of a truck and is killed ("Edges of the World"). Alison, newly reconciled to her past, remembers and draws a moment of perfect balance: playing "airplane" with her father, while reminiscing about the past with the other Alisons ("Flying Away").&lt;ref name="soundtrack_liner_notes" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Fun Home overview|url=https://www.nytimes.com/theater/show/76434/Fun-Home/overview|accessdate=October 18, 2013|newspaper=The New York Times}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It also includes more dialogue to help the listener follow the story. The song "Party Dress" was added for Small Alison in place of "Al for Short", as the latter has been removed from the Broadway show. A dialogue scene, "Clueless in New York", replaced "I need more coffee". Bruce's short ''a capella'' bedtime song, "Pony Girl" was added, as was the scene "A flair for the dramatic...".

==Critical reception==
The Off-Broadway production opened on October 22, 2013, to positive reviews. [[Ben Brantley]] of ''[[The New York Times]]'' spoke of the musical's emotional impact, artistry and universality, calling it a "beautiful heartbreaker of a musical".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Brantley|first1=Ben| author-link1=Ben Brantley|title=Family as a Hall of Mirrors|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2013/10/23/theater/reviews/fun-home-a-new-musical-at-the-public-theater.html|accessdate=23 October 2013|newspaper=The New York Times|date=23 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; "''Fun Home'' isn’t just a coming out story or a coming-of-age story. Its universality comes from its awareness of how we never fully know even those closest to us, and of the undercurrent of grown-up secrets, intuited by children, that exists to some degree in every family. ''Fun Home'' finds a shining clarity that lights up the night." Brantley praised both writer Kron and composer Tesori for their work. Of Kron he says: "her book and resonantly precise lyrics give this show its essential spine", and of Tesori's score "her best and most varied score to date... [which] captures [the story's] haunting ambiguity." Brantley later listed ''Fun Home'' as one of his top 15 shows of 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Brantley |first1=Ben | author-link1=Ben Brantley |date=12 December 2013 |title=A Magic Blazing From Stage to Stage: Ben Brantley’s Theater Favorites for 2013 |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2013/12/15/theater/ben-brantleys-theater-favorites-for-2013.html |newspaper=The New York Times |accessdate=15 December 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Joe Dziemianowicz of the New York ''[[Daily News (New York)|Daily News]]'' called the musical "achingly beautiful" and said that it "speaks to one family and all families torn by secrets and lies".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Dziemianowicz|first=Joe|title="Fun Home," theater review.

Bechdel's ironically self-aware and inwardly searching sensibility is honored by a musical that isn't afraid to reveal its awkward side." Though less positive than Brantley, Dziemianowicz or McNulty, Miriam Krule of ''[[Slate (magazine)|Slate]]'' still said "there are also moments of pure joy, and the musical shines during these".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Krule |first=Miriam |title=Fun Home the Musical is Fun, but Very Messy |url=http://www.slate.com/blogs/outward/2013/10/22/fun_home_at_the_public_theater_reviewed.html |publisher=[[Slate (magazine)|Slate]] |accessdate=23 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Krule felt, however, that "it's not clear that a musical is the best second format for the material". Adam Hetrick, editor-in-chief of [[Playbill|Playbill.com]], described ''Fun Home'' as "the best musical of the year", calling it "an emotionally-packed piece of theatre, full of joy, heart, sorrow and uncomfortable reality".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Hetrick |first=Adam |date=21 December 2013 |title=The Year's Best: Playbill Contributors Choose Unforgettable Experiences of 2013 |url=http://www.playbill.com/features/article/185778-The-Years-Best-Playbill-Contributors-Choose-Unforgettable-Experiences-of-2013/pg6 |archive-url=https://archive.is/20131225050400/http://www.playbill.com/features/article/185778-The-Years-Best-Playbill-Contributors-Choose-Unforgettable-Experiences-of-2013/pg6 |dead-url=yes |archive-date=25 December 2013 |newspaper=[[Playbill]] |accessdate=24 December 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; 

''New York Times'' music critic [[Anthony Tommasini]] praised Tesori's score as a "masterpiece", noting that the "vibrant pastiche songs" and "varied kinds of music... a jazzy number for the young Alison in the middle of a rescue fantasy; Sondheim-influenced songs that unfold over insistent rhythmic figures and shifting, rich harmonies" come together to create "an impressively integrated entity". Tommasini also praised the show's ensemble numbers, calling them "complex yet texturally transparent, engrossingly dramatic".&lt;ref name="thommasini"&gt;{{cite news |last=Tommasini |first=Anthony |authorlink=Anthony Tommasini |date=May 22, 2014 |title=Pastiche, Parody, Homage and Theft: This Season’s Stage Scores Show a Variety of Influences |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2014/05/25/theater/eclectic-scores-in-the-seasons-broadway-crop.html |newspaper=[[The New York Times]] |accessdate=June 6, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Reviewing the cast album for ''[[Playbill]]'', Steven Suskin praised Kron's "marvelous set" of lyrics, called Tesori "a master of musical styles... [who] matches Kron's tone with a mix of sensitivity and humor." Suskin singled out "Days and Days" for especial praise, calling it "a staggering piece of musical theatre writing". He also lauded the performances of Judy Kuhn ("stunning"), Michael Cerveris ("one of his finest performances ever") and the three Alisons, Beth Malone, Alexandra Socha and Sydney Lucas (calling the last "one of the most assured child actors we've seen"). Suskin called ''Fun Home'' "the best musical on the New York stage of 2013 — far outclassing the competition — and ... thus far the best musical of the 2013-14 season."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Suskin |first=Steven |date=February 23, 2014 |title=ON THE RECORD: Jeanine Tesori and Lisa Kron's Fun Home |url=http://www.playbill.com/news/article/187857-ON-THE-RECORD-Jeanine-Tesori-and-Lisa-Krons-Fun-Home- |newspaper=[[Playbill]] |accessdate=February 26, 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140302172659/http://www.playbill.com/news/article/187857-ON-THE-RECORD-Jeanine-Tesori-and-Lisa-Krons-Fun-Home- |archivedate=March 2, 2014 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Anticipating the play's move to Broadway, David Levesley of online magazine ''Mic'' heralded ''Fun Home''{{'}}s focus on the individual experience of a lesbian, calling it "the most daring, relentless analysis of homosexual identity on the New York stage right now".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Levesley |first=David |date=August 15, 2014 |title=Broadway Is About to Welcome Its Most Important LGBT Show Yet |url=http://mic.com/articles/96164/broadway-is-about-to-welcome-its-most-important-lgbt-show-yet |newspaper=Mic |location=New York |accessdate=September 9, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Kalle Oskari Mattila, in ''[[The Atlantic]]'', however, argued that although the musical presents the novel's themes clearly, its Broadway marketing campaign "obfuscates rather than clarifies" the queer narrative of the original novel.&lt;ref&gt;Mattila, Kalle Oskari.

The '''Games, Learning &amp; Society''' [[academic conference]], or GLS conference, was an annual gathering of academic researchers, [[video game developer]]s, and government and industry leaders in [[Madison, Wisconsin]], to discuss the social significance of [[computer and video game culture|gaming culture]]. Specifically, they examined how games can be used to transform how people learn and what implications that knowledge has for society. According to the official website, the conference's stated mission was to foster substantive discussion and collaboration among academics, designers, and educators interested in how videogames - commercial games and others—can enhance learning, culture, and education.  The founder and chair was [[Constance Steinkuehler]].  The first conference was held in 2005, and took place at the [[Monona Terrace]], a conference center inspired by the design of Wisconsin architect [[Frank Lloyd Wright]].  The final conference was held in 2016, where Constance Steinkuehler announced she was leaving the [[University of Wisconsin–Madison]], and that the GLS conference would not continue in her absence.

'''''Ghost in the Machine''''', originally titled '''''A Good House Is Hard to Find'',''' is a 1981 [[performance art|performance]] created by American artist [[Linda Nishio]]. The work combines written and spoken text, [[slide projection]] and [[film]], sound, [[sculpture]], and the use of an assistant. She originally performed it at [[Franklin Furnace Archive|Franklin Furnace]] in [[New York City]] and performed other iterations through 1983, including at the [[Woman's Building]] in [[Los Angeles]].&lt;ref name=Wolv&gt;Wolverton, Terry, "At Home at the Woman's Building: Ghost in the Machine," [[High Performance Magazine|High Performance]], issue 24, 1983, illus.&lt;/ref&gt; Her second performance for the New York nonprofit space&lt;ref name=Apple2005&gt;Jacki Apple, [https://www.jstor.org/stable/4488618 "A Different World: A Personal History of Franklin Furnace"], 49(1), Spring 2005 (pp. 36–54), pp. 52–53.&lt;/ref&gt;  was reviewed by [[Lucy Lippard]] for the ''[[Village Voice]]'',&lt;ref&gt;''Village Voice,'' vol. 26, no.13, March 18–24, 1981.&lt;/ref&gt; and included in Lippard's 1984 book, ''Get the Message: A Decade of Art for Social Change.''&lt;ref name=book&gt;Lippard, Lucy, ''Get the Message: A Decade of Art for Social Change'' (New York: E.P. Dutton, 1984)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Description==
The piece begins with images of a tormented woman, projected with a recording of voices asking "Hey, why are you so tormented?"  With Nishio on stage, wearing a house covering her face and head, a dialectic is created between emotions and thinking, then a recording of Nishio's voice outlines an effort to stay in control while participating in daily life:

&lt;blockquote&gt;[W]hile the telephone rings and the dog shuffles by someone knocks at the door. Why don't you just sit down and think, think, think, think.&lt;ref name=Wolv/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

A diagram of the artist's head is flashed with the word ''think'' repeated and pointing to various parts of the brain. There is a film of Nishio inside the house that she wears. She performs a [[monologue]] about the thinking process after which she takes off the house and throws across the stage. A [[meditation]] tape is played, and the artist lies down performing the soothing exercises instructed. The final instruction is 

&lt;blockquote&gt;[I]nside the brain, imagine a huge switchboard. Walk over to it and pull out all the plugs but one. Your only thought is your whole body, feeling quiet, comfortable, relaxed.&lt;ref name=Wolv/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The piece also makes use of Nishio's shadow, and her assistant comes in throughout the performance to put up then take down cutouts of women.&lt;ref name=book/&gt; In the earlier Franklin Furnace performance, the house covered Nishio's midsection.&lt;ref name=book/&gt;

==Critical reception==

Of the 1983 performance at the Woman's Building, [[Terry Wolverton]] described it as: 

&lt;blockquote&gt;a fast-paced multi-media tour of the activities of the brain, and of the person who tries to live inside the brain, disassociated from flesh, spirit, emotion ... Nishio plugs her audience into the rhythms of the over-taxed, over-stimulated nervous system.&lt;ref name=Wolv/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Wolverton complains about the size of the L.A. performance space lauding the work itself writing, "there's scarcely a superfluous movement, image, or word." She further writes of Nishio's performance, "It is rare to witness a performer undergo an internal process while performing, and this willingness to be vulnerable gives the work a great sense of depth and strength."&lt;ref name=Wolv/&gt;

Lippard in her book called the work "bitterly beautiful," its meanings "layered," its images "striking." The critic interpreted the performance's themes as [[racism]], [[real estate]], and dislocation, and the use of "'interior decoration' as a metaphor for cultural differences."&lt;ref name=book/&gt;

'''IMG''', originally known as the '''International Management Group''', is a global sports, other events and talent management company headquartered in [[New York City]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.img.com/about-us.aspx img.com] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150228161940/http://www.img.com/about-us.aspx |date=2015-02-28 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It has been  owned by [[William Morris Endeavor]] and [[Silver Lake Partners]] since 2013. Trans World International (TWI) is the event company of IMG.

==History==
IMG was founded in 1960 in [[Cleveland]], [[Ohio]] by [[Mark McCormack]], an [[Americans|American]] lawyer who spotted the potential for athletes to make large incomes from endorsement in the television age; he signed professional golfers Arnold Palmer, Gary Player and Jack Nicklaus as his first clients. McCormack died in 2003. In 2004 [[Forstmann Little]], led by [[Theodore J. Forstmann]], acquired the company; Forstmann served as chairman and CEO until his death in late&amp;nbsp;2011.

In 2006, IMG&amp;nbsp;Media acquired nunet&amp;nbsp;AG,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nu-net.com/|title=可愛い赤ちゃんが生まれたら出産祝い！出産祝い・内祝いって何？|author=|date=|website=www.nu-net.com|accessdate=14 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; a provider of [[Mobile television|mobile&amp;nbsp;TV]]&amp;nbsp;services to [[mobile network operator]]s around the world. Clients of nunet's mobile&amp;nbsp;TV CMS currently include: [[Vodafone]], [[Proximus]], [[Vodacom]], [[mobilkom Austria|Mobilkom&amp;nbsp;A1]]. Content distributed currently includes [[MTV]], [[Fashion&amp;nbsp;TV]], [[Eurosport]], and [[Discovery Networks]].

In November 2007, IMG acquired [[Kentucky]]-based Host Communications, which had multiple business units with services ranging from sports marketing and broadcasting to the management of associations and non-profit organizations. The sports-related businesses were combined with the Collegiate Licensing Company (CLC) to form [[IMG&amp;nbsp;College]], while the association management division was renamed IMG&amp;nbsp;Associations.

IMG was originally headquartered in [[downtown Cleveland]] in a complex built in 1965 diagonally across the street from [[Erieview Tower]]. When the IMG&amp;nbsp;Center was built, it originally housed the Cuyahoga Saving Bank, which was acquired by [[Charter One Bank]] in 1998. In 1997, IMG renovated the Cuyahoga Savings Bank Building and renamed it [[IMG Center]]. At street level they have a projection screen showing their businesses, events and clients, with images ranging from [[Formula&amp;nbsp;One]] racing to professional golfers. Following the acquisition of IMG by [[Forstmann Little]], the headquarters remained in [[Cleveland]], Ohio, for several years until officially relocating to its new parent company's existing offices in New York, in 2010, though the [[IMG Center]] is still located on East Ninth Street in Cleveland.

On October 15, 2010, IMG acquired ISP, the multimedia rights holder for more than 50&amp;nbsp;universities based in [[Winston-Salem]], North Carolina. As a result of the acquisition, IMG&amp;nbsp;College retained ISP's former headquarters in Winston-Salem.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bizjournals.com/triad/stories/2010/10/11/daily54.html bizjournals.com]&lt;/ref&gt;

===International Classroom===
[[Image:Costa Rica ICF.jpg|left|thumb| Students posing after a [[Costa Rica]] presentation]] The International Children’s Festival is a part of Meridian’s educational [[outreach]] initiatives — the [[flagship]] of which is the International Classroom, currently in its 19th year of bringing the world into District of Columbia Public School classrooms.  The [http://www.meridian.org/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=92&amp;Itemid=90/ International Classroom] trains volunteers from the international community to present interactive lessons on their home country to students in grades 2-12.  Presentations are organized by Meridian in response to a high demand from DC public school teachers, and Meridian staff works closely with volunteers to ensure that presentations are tailored to each audience based on grade level.  In the 2007-2008 school year, International Classroom worked with over 100 volunteers from 50 countries and reached over 2,500 students.  [[Image:Morocco Culture Box at ICF 2009 DSCF3010.JPG|right|thumb| [[Morocco]] Culture Box]]

===International Resource Library===
International Classroom also offers teachers other [[resources]] to help them include more international education in their [[curricula]].  Meridian’s 50+ Culture Boxes contain items from a specific country or region that teachers can use as hands-on learning tools to help students make a tangible connection to other parts of the world.

===Teacher Workshops===
International Classroom also offers a professional development [[workshop]],  ''Passports to the World'', for DC teachers each Fall on how to internationalize their curricula while meeting current [[Standards of Learning]]. These workshops help teachers discover new methods of incorporating international education across the curricula. Over the course of six afternoons, teachers will travel to five different continents, exploring themes, ideas, and techniques to use in the classroom.  Working in cooperation with Peace Corps: World Wise Schools and the National Geographic Society Education Foundation, teachers also earn credits toward recertification.

The '''Jersey Eisteddfod''' is a cultural festival and competition in [[Jersey]].

It was founded in 1908 by a former [[Dean of Jersey]] who saw its competitive classes as a means by which the speech, presentation, and musical standards of his fellow islanders might be improved. With the exception of the years of the two [[World War]]s, it has taken place annually ever since. It was based on the [[eisteddfod]] tradition of Wales.

After its inception the festival expanded rapidly to encompass other disciplines and crafts, with dance, art, needlework, photography being early additions, which still thrive. Sections have been discarded when no longer applicable (including laundry and shorthand) but others are adopted and integrated, including youth creative arts, crafts and flower arranging. The advent of television in the 1960s had a depressing effect on entries, but this trend was reversed by the middle of the 1980s. From that time there has been a steady increase in interest.

There are currently two festivals held annually:
*the Festival of Creative Arts, held in March (the "Spring Festival")
*the Festival of Performing Arts held in November (the "Autumn Festival").

Each attracts nearly 3,000 entries, and, via teachers, relations and supporters, it is estimated that the Jersey Eisteddfod reaches a minimum of 10 percent of the population at any one time. With its continuing growth, it has been necessary to move to larger premises for the Spring Festival, and to operate simultaneously at two venues in the Autumn. There are currently 14 autonomous sections: Arts and crafts as adult, primary school, secondary school and youth creative arts; photography, flower arranging, video, handwriting and needlework; dance, music, English speech and drama, [[Jèrriais]] and [[French language|French]]. Each section sets its own syllabus, engages one or more adjudicators and supervises the entries and the management of the competitions; and is responsible for communications with the competitors. The management of the Jersey Eisteddfod is accomplished by volunteers who either hold office or are enrolled to assist [as in stewarding] on an occasional basis. There are currently more than 100 persons recorded as having official status.

In [[journalism]], '''local news''' refers to coverage of events, by the [[news]], in a local context that would not be an interest of another locality, or otherwise be of national or international scope. Local news, in contrast to national or international news, caters to the news of their regional and local communities; they focus on more localized issues and events.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Local Journalism and Local Media : Making the Local News|last=Franklin|first=Bob|publisher=Taylor and Francis|year=1998|isbn=|location=https://ebookcentral.proquest.com/lib/aul/detail.action?docID=240326|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some key features of local newsrooms includes regional politics, business, and human interest stories.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Meyer|first=Kelly M.|last2=Tang|first2=Tang|date=2015-10-02|title=#SocialJournalism: Local News Media on Twitter|url=https://dx.doi.org/10.1080/14241277.2015.1107569|journal=International Journal on Media Management|volume=17|issue=4|pages=241–257|doi=10.1080/14241277.2015.1107569|issn=1424-1277}}&lt;/ref&gt; Local news readership has been declining in recent years, according to a recent study.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Wadbring|first=Ingela|last2=Bergström|first2=Annika|date=2017-02-01|title=A Print Crisis or a Local Crisis?|url=https://dx.doi.org/10.1080/1461670X.2015.1042988|journal=Journalism Studies|volume=18|issue=2|pages=175–190|doi=10.1080/1461670X.2015.1042988|issn=1461-670X}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Television ==
Opt-outs of local [[television news]] are frequent before, during, or after national evening news [[television program]]ming.  Often times, television networks can also commission or make provisions for their local stations to produce a longer standalone local news programmes.  In some cases, local television markets/viewing areas within a country may even have a dedicated 24-hour local news channel. Local news stations have also started covering less and less local politics in favor of stories that they believe will garner more clicks or attention.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; A study has also shown that there has also been less investigative journalism within local news stations in recent years.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

=== Differences ===
Local news largely covers the following:
* local sports
* local crime and justice
* local weather
* local business and economy
* local events
* local education
* local politics
* local traffic updates (especially during morning newscasts)

National and international news, however, tend to cover a wider range of content, including news concerning specialized institutions of wide-ranging international power or influence, such as:
* (inter)national political and intergovernmental events
* stock markets
* (inter)national sports competitions
* regional environmental events
* media/entertainment events
* science/technology events
* air traffic/aviatory transport events
* defense/security events

=== Practices in each country ===
In the [[United States]], local news is provided on local [[commercial broadcasting]] channels (some of which are [[television network]] [[Network affiliate|affiliate]]s).  They can either be standalone newscasts that run for at least a half-hour or short segments that air attached to national morning newscasts approximately 25 and 55 minutes past the hour.  As not all stations are owned and operated by a television network, the graphics, branding, and studio designs of a station's newscasts often differ from the network they are affiliated with although in recent years, affiliates have made some form of on-air reference to their corresponding networks in the branding of their newscasts.  In addition, the local news departments of stations also superimpose their on-screen digital clocks, thermometers, and (occasionally) local news tickers on graphics provided by networks during morning network newscasts.  Some cable channels are dedicated to local news coverage.  Examples of this include [[NY1]] in New York and [[NewsChannel 8 (cable channel)|NewsChannel 8]] in the Washington DC market.

In the [[United Kingdom]], most local news is provided on a local network station with similar branding and studio design to that of the national network news. Examples of this include the nationally networked [[BBC News]] and its regional news services such as [[BBC North West Tonight]] (on [[BBC North West]]) and [[BBC Newsline]] (on [[BBC Northern Ireland]]); the nationally networked [[ITV News]] and its regional stations including [[ITV Granada]] and [[UTV (TV channel)|UTV]].  The long version of BBC and ITV's local news shows often air during the 18:00 hour on weekday evenings.  STV, which simulcasts most of the ITV network's programmes in Scotland, is not owned and operated by ITV but has its own branded newscast that broadcasts Scottish-centred news at the same time as ITV's regional news services.

In France, most local news is aired on France Televisions' [[France 3]].  Additionally BFM TV also has a local news channel for the Ile-de-France region called BFM Paris.

Norway's public broadcaster, [[NRK1]], airs a local news programme called NRK Distriktsnyheter (name of viewing area) every weekday evening at 18:45 Central European Time, just before the main national newscast Dagsrevyen.  A replay of all local newscasts across the country is shown on NRK2 the following morning (Tuesday to Saturday).

In Sweden, SVT's regional news is simply called SVT Nyheter (name of viewing area) which shares the same branding as the network's main newscast, Rapport.  Unlike SVT's counterparts in the US and UK, during morning programmes, the local news opt-out airs in the middle of each half-hour.  Since June 2007, the morning regional cut-ins no longer feature an in-studio presenters but instead show compiled short reports from various correspondents across the region.  When SVT World was still airing, the simulcast of the morning programme featured a different regional opt-out during each half-hour.  A 13-minute standalone local newscast airs at 18:30 Central European Time each weekday evening after Sportnytt (SVT's sport news) on SVT1.  Additionally, a short local news segment is incorporated into SVT's other evening newscast Aktuellt which airs on SVT2.  In that case, this local news segment shares the same branding and graphics as Aktuellt.  There are no local SVT newscasts on Saturdays.

==Newspapers==
A lot of newspapers specialise in covering the cities they are based in.  Although paper copies of local newspapers are usually sold and circulated exclusively in the local areas they operate (with entities such as libraries or relatives wanting a copy of the paper where a family member is mentioned being mailed copies of outside of circulation areas), companies may make digital copies of their newspapers available to interested readers directly on their website or through services such as PressReader often with a paid subscription.

In the United States, although newspapers such as ''[[The New York Times]]'' and ''[[The Washington Post]]'' have a 'national' focus on their front pages, they still have dedicated sections for news in the areas they are based in.  Weather sections also highlight conditions in the local area and the sport sections feature local teams alongside national sport stories.  Their local editions also feature local classified ads.

==Local News in the Digital Age==
In the age of digital media, local news readership has started to fall.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; This can be attributed to the younger generation's disinterest in traditional news sources and the inability of news stations to fully integrate their business models and practices into the age of digital journalism.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; While national and international news industries began using Twitter as a way to break news and interact with their audiences, local news mediums have fallen behind, trending towards using Twitter as a secondary source for spreading information rather than a primary tool for audience engagement.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

Since Internet sites reach a larger audience, more local news agencies have started their own websites to compete in the digital age.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Websites are a great way for local news stations to produce more interactive content, which engages the audiences and increases readership.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

Aside from the Internet, Twitter specifically has become a great way to engage the younger generation in news, gain more readership, and spread information.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; National news sources have started using Twitter to quickly notify the public of breaking news and to interact with their readers, but local news have failed to integrate Twitter and other forms of social media into their journalism practices as successfully.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; While local TV news stations have actually been a bit more effective with using social media, local newspapers have overall fallen behind.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; By engaging the audience and spreading important information, social media has been considered a solid method for strengthening the core standards of journalism.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; As a result, social media like Twitter has become a vital tool for news agencies to incorporate into their everyday practices.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

As a result of the transition to digital content, local news agencies have had to change their business models. Although they previously gained revenue from subscriptions, more agencies have started making money from online advertising, but this only accounts for a small portion of revenue.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; This loss in revenue has been linked to a decline in local journalistic integrity, because with less profit, the need to make money through clickbait articles has become a necessity.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

'''''Majrowski v Guy's and St Thomas' NHS Trust''''' [2006] [http://www.bailii.org/uk/cases/UKHL/2006/34.html UKHL 34] is a [[UK labour law]] case holding that an employer will be [[vicariously liable]] for the [[harassment]] of an employee by another.

==Facts==
Mr William Majrowski was a gay man, and worked as a clinical auditor co-ordinator. He claimed that his manager, Sandra Freeman [[bullied]] and [[Harassment|harassed]] him, in breach of section 1 of the [[Protection from Harassment Act 1997]]. He said this made the employer vicariously liable. The judge held there was no cause of action because section 3 created no statutory tort for which an employer could be vicariously liable.

==Judgment==
The House of Lords held that there was a new statutory tort for harassment in the [[Protection from Harassment Act 1997]], and it made employers vicariously liable. It was not solely about stalking. This was supported by section 10(1) concerning Scotland. Lord Nicholls emphasised the overlap with European Directives’ common definition of harassment, meaning unwanted conduct violating the dignity of a person. He said the following.

{{Cquote|9. Whatever its historical origin, this common law principle of strict liability for another person's wrongs finds its rationale today in a combination of policy factors. They are summarised in Professor Fleming's Law of Torts, 9th ed, (1998) pages 409-410. Stated shortly, these factors are that all forms of economic activity carry a risk of harm to others, and fairness requires that those responsible for such activities should be liable to persons suffering loss from wrongs committed in the conduct of the enterprise. This is 'fair', because it means injured persons can look for recompense to a source better placed financially than individual wrongdoing employees. It means also that the financial loss arising from the wrongs can be spread more widely, by liability insurance and higher prices. In addition, and importantly, imposing strict liability on employers encourages them to maintain standards of 'good practice' by their employees. For these reasons employers are to be held liable for wrongs committed by their employees in the course of their employment.

10. With these policy considerations in mind, it is difficult to see a coherent basis for confining the common law principle of vicarious liability to common law wrongs. The rationale underlying the principle holds good for equitable wrongs. The rationale also holds good for a wrong comprising a breach of a statutory duty or prohibition which gives rise to civil liability, provided always the statute does not expressly or impliedly indicate otherwise. A precondition of vicarious liability is that the wrong must be committed by an employee in the course of his employment. A wrong is committed in the course of employment only if the conduct is so closely connected with acts the employee is authorised to do that, for the purposes of the liability of the employer to third parties, the wrongful conduct may fairly and properly be regarded as done by the employee while acting in the course of his employment: see ''[[Lister v Hesley Hall Ltd]]'' [2002] 1 AC 215, 245, para 69, per Lord Millett, and ''[[Dubai Aluminium Co Ltd v Salaam]]'' [2002] UKHL 48, [2003] 2 AC 366, 377, para 23. If this prerequisite is satisfied the policy reasons underlying the common law principle are as much applicable to equitable wrongs and breaches of statutory obligations as they are to common law torts. 

[...]

24. [...] Neither the terms nor the practical effect of this legislation indicate that Parliament intended to exclude the ordinary principle of vicarious liability.

25. As to the terms of the legislation, by section 3 Parliament created a new cause of action, a new civil wrong. Damages are one of the remedies for this wrong, although they are not the primary remedy. Parliament has spelled out some particular features of this new wrong: anxiety is a head of damage, the limitation period is six years, and so on. These features do not in themselves indicate an intention to exclude vicarious liability. Vicarious liability arises only if the new wrong is committed by an employee in the course of his employment, as already described. The acts of the employee must meet the 'close connection' test. If an employee's acts of harassment meet this test, I am at a loss to see why these particular features of this newly created wrong should be thought to place this wrong in a special category in which an employer is exempt from vicarious liability. It is true that this new wrong usually comprises conduct of an intensely personal character between two individuals. But this feature may also be present with other wrongs which attract vicarious liability, such as assault.

26. Nor does imposition of criminal liability only on the perpetrator of the wrong, and on a person who aids, abets, counsels or procures the harassing conduct, point to a different conclusion. Conversion, assault and battery may attract criminal liability as well as civil liability, but this does not exclude vicarious liability.

27. I turn to the practical effect of the legislation. Vicarious liability for an employee's harassment of another person, whether a fellow employee or not, will to some extent increase employers' burdens. That is clear. But, here again, this does not suffice to show Parliament intended to exclude the ordinary common law principle of vicarious liability. Parliament added harassment to the list of civil wrongs. Parliament did so because it considered the existing law provided insufficient protection for victims of harassment. The inevitable consequence of Parliament creating this new wrong of universal application is that at times an employee will commit this wrong in the course of his employment. This prompts the question: why should an employer have a special dispensation in respect of the newly-created wrong and not be liable if an employee commits this wrong in the course of his employment? The contemporary rationale of employers' vicarious liability is as applicable to this new wrong as it is to common law torts.

28. Take a case where an employee, in the course of his employment, harasses a non-employee, such as a customer of the employer. In such a case the employer would be liable if his employee had assaulted the customer. Why should this not equally be so in respect of harassment? In principle, harassment arising from a dispute between two employees stands on the same footing. If, acting in the course of his employment, one employee assaults another, the employer is liable. Why should harassment be treated differently?

29. As I see it, the matter of most concern to employers is the prospect of abuse in cases of alleged workplace harassment. Employers fear the prospect of a multiplicity of unfounded, speculative claims if they are vicariously liable for employees' harassment. Disgruntled employees or ex-employees, perhaps suffering from stress at work unrelated to harassment, perhaps bitter at being dismissed, will all too readily advance unmeritorious claims for compensation for harassment. Internal grievance procedures will not always satisfy an employee who is nursing a grievance. Although awards of damages for anxiety under the 1997 Act will normally be modest, a claimant may well pursue his present or erstwhile employer, not the alleged wrongdoer himself. The claim may be put forward for the first time years after the alleged harassment is said to have occurred. The alleged perpetrator may no longer be with the employer and may not be traceable.

30. This is a real and understandable concern. But these difficulties, and the prospect of abuse, are not sufficient reasons for excluding vicarious liability. To exclude liability on these grounds would be, to use the hackneyed phrase, to throw the baby out with the bathwater. It would mean that where serious harassment by an employee in the course of his employment has occurred, the victim - who may not be a fellow employee - would not have the right normally provided by the law to persons who suffer a wrong in that circumstance, namely, the right to have recourse to the wrongdoer's employer. The possibility of abuse is not a good reason for denying that right. Courts are well able to separate the wheat from the chaff at an early stage of the proceedings. They should be astute to do so. In most cases courts should have little difficulty in applying the 'close connection' test. Where the claim meets that requirement, and the quality of the conduct said to constitute harassment is being examined, courts will have in mind that irritations, annoyances, even a measure of upset, arise at times in everybody's day-to-day dealings with other people. Courts are well able to recognise the boundary between conduct which is unattractive, even unreasonable, and conduct which is oppressive and unacceptable. To cross the boundary from the regrettable to the unacceptable the gravity of the misconduct must be of an order which would sustain criminal liability under section 2. 

''The overlap with the EC discrimination legislation''

31. I turn next to a difficult part of the case. The Trust placed reliance on the overlap which exists between the harassment provisions in the 1997 Act and the harassment provisions in the series of non-discrimination regulations introduced to give effect to Directives 2000/43/EC, 2000/78/EC and 2002/73/EC.... The directives established a common framework for tackling discrimination on six specific grounds: sex, race, disability, sexual orientation, religion or belief, and age. 

32. One example of the overlap will suffice. On the relevant point the several regulations are substantially to the same effect. The Race Relations Act 1976 (Amendment)) Regulations 2003 (SI 2003/1626) inserted into the Race Relations Act 1976 new provisions regarding harassment. The effect of section 4(2A), read with section 3A, is that it is unlawful for an employer to subject an employee to harassment on the grounds of race or ethnic or national origins. Harassment means, in short, engaging in unwanted conduct which has the purpose or effect of violating another person's dignity or creating an intimidating, hostile, degrading, humiliating or offensive environment for another person. Section 32, which was part of the statute as originally enacted in 1976, provides that anything done by a person in the course of his employment shall be treated as done by his employer as well as by him, subject to the 'employer's defence', as it is known colloquially. The employer's defence is that in proceedings brought against an employer in respect of an act alleged to have been done by an employee the employer has a defence where he can prove he took such steps as were reasonably practicable steps to prevent the employee from doing that act or acts of that description: section 32(3). The Trust contrasted the availability of this defence in proceedings brought under the Race Relations Act 1976 with the position under the 1997 Act if an employer is strictly liable under the 1997 Act for harassment committed by his employees in the course of their employment. The contrast means that if an employer's liability under the 1997 Act is strict, victims of racial harassment can in some circumstances bypass the defence intended to be available to employers under the amendments made to the Race Relations Act 1976. Victims can do so by taking the simple step of bringing their harassment claims under the 1997 Act. By this means victims can also bypass the strict time limits applicable to discrimination claims.

33. Had the amending regulations of 2003 been made before the 1997 Act was enacted this would have been a telling point. But they were not. In short the historical explanation of how it comes about that the employer's defence is available in harassment claims brought under the [[Race Relations Act 1976]] is as follows. 

[...]

37. The legislative history regarding harassment on grounds of sex or disability is essentially similar. Amendments were made by regulations to the existing discrimination legislation: the Sex Discrimination Act 1975 and the Disability Discrimination Act 1995. Both those statutes already included provision for the employer's defence in respect of discrimination claims. There was no discrimination legislation already in existence regarding sexual orientation, religion or belief, or age. In these cases corresponding provision was made by regulations which have to stand on their own feet.

38. Given this history, the existence of the employer's defence in the discrimination legislation, embracing harassment as it now does pursuant to the requirements of the directives, and the absence of such a defence from the (earlier) 1997 Act, does not assist materially in the interpretation of the 1997 Act. The discrimination legislation, as it existed in 1997, is too removed from harassment for the inclusion of the employer's defence in that legislation to throw any light on the interpretation of the 1997 Act. The accretion of harassment to the discrimination legislation derives from the directives and came later.

39. Although these later amendments to the discrimination legislation do not assist in the interpretation of the 1997 Act, it must be acknowledged that in the fields they cover they have produced a discordant and unsatisfactory overlap with the 1997 Act.}}

Lord Hope, Lady Hale, Lord Carswell and Lord Brown gave concurring opinions.

[[File:St Patricks Day Parade logo.png|thumb|The Shamrock Club Saint Patrick Parade logo]]

'''Milwaukee Saint Patrick's Day Parade''' takes place each year in downtown Milwaukee the Saturday prior to [[Saint Patrick's Day]]. It is sponsored by the [[Shamrock Club of Wisconsin]]. In 2018, the Shamrock Club will be producing its 52nd Annual parade.

The parade is part of a week-long series of events co-sponsored by the Shamrock Club and its partner, Westown Association.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://westown.org|title = website|date = |accessdate = |website = Westown Association|publisher = Westown|last = Westown|first = Association}}&lt;/ref&gt; These include Irish events at the Shops of Grand Avenue&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.grandavenueshops.com/|title = Shops of Grand Avenue|date = |accessdate = |website = |publisher = |last = Shops of|first = Grand Avenue}}&lt;/ref&gt; in downtown Milwaukee, Westown's '''SHAM-Rock''' the Avenue at the Miller Time Pub in the [[Hilton Milwaukee City Center]] on Friday evening, the Shamrock Club's annual Mass in Honor of Saint Patrick at Saint Patrick's Church in Milwaukee, and the Shamrock Club's Post Parade Party at the Irish Cultural and Heritage Center on Saturday, the largest parade day family event, with four stages, four dance schools, seven bands, and a Children's Area.

The parade runs from 6th and Wisconsin, with official step off at 3rd and Wisconsin, running to Plankinton Avenue, to Old World Third Street, east on Juneau to Water, and ending on Highland. The route is approximately one and one half miles, and takes about 90 minutes.

==History==
The first parade, on March 17, 1843, was organized partly by Milwaukee officials and members of the Catholic Church in Milwaukee. The Milwaukee officials were trying to garner more influence for the area, as it was smaller than Green Bay. Catholic leaders in Milwaukee were trying to have the American Catholic Church, based in Baltimore, place the Archdiocese in Milwaukee. At the time, the United States Church was becoming dominated by Irish cardinals. The Milwaukee Irish and German religious, (there were many Irish born and Gaelic speaking priests in the Wisconsin territory), worked on the bias towards the Irish by the American bishops.

A Swiss German priest, Father Martin Kundig, pushed the idea of the parade. According to Father Leo Johnson, in his 1942 book, ''Stuffed Saddlebags - The Life Of Father Martin Kundig, Priest - 1805-1879'', "His was a life filled with character."
&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Stuffed Saddlebags - The Life of Father Martin Kundig, Priest |last=John |first=Peter Leo |publisher=Kessinger Publishing, LLC |year=2007 |isbn=1-4325-1672-8 |location=Milwaukee, WI |pages=110-110}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The original parade started at what is today East Wells Street and Van Buren, went north on Van Buren, west on what is today State Street, then south on Jackson Street and back to Wells Street. They circled the church of St. Peter, on Jackson and State, the main downtown church at that time. The Parade Marshal was Milwaukee founder &lt;nowiki&gt;''&lt;/nowiki&gt;[[Solomon Juneau]]

By 1844, Milwaukee became the Archdiocese of Wisconsin, beating out the French strongholds of [[Green Bay, Wisconsin]] and [[Prairie du Chien, Wisconsin]] in the western part of the State. The newly consecrated Bishop, John Henni, purchased land near the original parade staging area for the [[Cathedral of St. John the Evangelist (Milwaukee)]].

===Reemergence of the Parade in 1967===
In 1967, the parade marshaled at the top of the Lincoln Memorial Bridge, at the Milwaukee Art Museum, and marched west along Wisconsin Avenue. The parade terminated at the Milwaukee Public Library, on 10th and Wisconsin. This lasted for one year, as it was discovered, as said Danny O'Donoghue, "The wind blows from west to east, and we had a hard time with the banners and the flags. We decided to reroute the parade."&lt;ref&gt;Fifty Years of The Shamrock Club - Conversations With The Shamrock Club - Published program for the Shamrock Club's 50th Anniversary - 2000.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1968, the parade route was reversed. The parade was marshaled at the [[Milwaukee Public Library]], then headed east along Wisconsin Avenue, and terminated at the [[Milwaukee County War Memorial]], on Lincoln Memorial Drive and Mason Street. A review stand was positioned at Water and Wisconsin, on the [[Marine National Bank]] Plaza front court.

===Mitchell Street===

Parade organizers were invited to move to [[Mitchell Street District, Milwaukee|Mitchell Street]]  on the South Side of Milwaukee. The street was named for Milwaukee pioneer and Scots immigrant [[Alexander Mitchell (Wisconsin politician)|Alexander Mitchell]]  It was a business district, filled with department stores and smaller stores. The Mitchell Street Business Association hoped that the appearance of the parade along Milwaukee second oldest business strip would give it a spark at renewal. The parade was marshaled on First Street and Orchard, near the [[Allen-Bradley]], (now &lt;nowiki&gt;''&lt;/nowiki&gt;[[Rockwell International]]) headquarters. It marched down First to Mitchell Street, and up Mitchell to 13th Street. The parade attracted large crowds in what was then a Polish and Mexican neighborhood.

In 1977, Danny O'Donoghue stepped down as Parade Chair. The parade was then headed up by Jeanne McCue. She was the Shamrock Club's first Wild Irish Rose in 1973. McCue was later honored for her work during the Bosnian War, where she utilized her training as a nurse.

In 1978, Ms. McCue was succeeded by Catherine "Cate" Harris, a longtime Shamrock Club member. She would later help lead volunteers at the International Institute of Wisconsin's [[Holiday Folk Fair]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wauwatosanow.com/userstoriessubmitted/350742901.html]&lt;/ref&gt; There was still a strong Irish presence in the area, due to the families who settled at Saint Patrick Parish, located at 723 West Washington, a few blocks north of the staging area for the parade.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.archmil.org/Parishes/St.PatrickMilwaukeeF20.htm]&lt;/ref&gt; St. Patrick is the site of the yearly Mass in Honor of St. Patrick on Parade day.

Cate Harris was succeeded by Chuck Ward, one of the leading forces in the Nash's Irish Castle Kazoo Band. He was also a member of the Milwaukee-based Irish music band Blarney. He was later one of the main coordinators of the [[Milwaukee Irish Fest]].

===North Avenue===
In 1985, parade moved to North Avenue, where it ran from 53 Street in Milwaukee, to 74 Street in [[Wauwatosa, Wisconsin|Wauwatosa]]. The parade marshaled on the Steuben Middle School playground on 52 and North. The mayors of Milwaukee and Wauwatosa were a part of the parade each year. Maricolette Walsh, the Wauwatosa mayor, was also a Shamrock Club member. She helped to keep fees lower on the Wauwatosa side of 60th Street.

While on North Avenue, the Parade committee sponsored a window decorating contest for business along the parade route. The parade route businesses had leprechauns, floral displays, window paint, and shamrocks looking out at the crowds. At the terminus of the parade route, a post parade party was held at Pius XI Grade School, on 76 and Wright. When the parish decided to use their rink only for roller skating the party was moved to the Wauwatosa Civic Center on 76 and North. Both of the Milwaukee area Irish dance schools, Trinity Academy of Irish Dance and Cashel Dennehy Irish Dancers, performed alternating years.

A number of business owners on North Avenue complained of lost revenue for the parade day, as it was a Saturday, streets were closed from 9 AM until 2 pm, and many of the parade goers would just leave after the event, and not spend any money. An alternative was sought.

===Bluemound Road===
The parade was on Bluemound Road in 2001. It still crossed both the cities of Milwaukee and Wauwatosa. Pub owner and [[County Cork]] native Derry Hegarty, a former Shamrock Club president, helped facilitate the move. He was the owner of Derry Hegarty's Irish Pub on 54 and Bluemound, one of the many Irish pubs along Bluemound who were excited to host the event in this section of Milwaukee.

The parade started at 70 Street and ended at 51 Street. It was marshaled between 75 and 74 Streets. Financial problems arose with the co-sponsor, the Bluemound Business Advancement Association, so the Shamrock Club looked for another venue. According to the account in the February 2002 ''Emerald Reflections'', a four-year contract was rejected by the Bluemound Business Advancement Association, and they wanted to put in place a 3-year, $7000 annual contribution instead of the previously agreed-to $10,000 per year.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.angelfire.com/wi/shamrockclubwisc/Reflections/page139.html#lead]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Return to Downtown Milwaukee===
The Westown Business Development organization in downtown Milwaukee had been holding a parade on March 17 each year. The attendance was sparse, and the organization was looking for ways to increase attendance. They made a proposal initially in 2000, and after negotiations broke down with the Shamrock Club and the Bluemound Business group, another proposal was put in place. The two organizations agreed to move the 2002 parade downtown.

The parade took place in downtown Milwaukee in 2002. The original parade route was from 6th and Wisconsin, east to Water Street, north on Water Street, and west on Juneau Avenue to Old World Third Street to Wells and Plankinton. In 2004, the route was changed to go north on Plankinton Avenue to Old World Third Street, then to Juneau, east to Water Street, and terminating at Highland Boulevard. The change was done at the request of the [[Marcus Center]] for the Performing Arts, as the parade was blocking access to the center for Saturday matinees. The parade steps off at the [[Shops of Grand Avenue]] on 3rd and Wisconsin.

[[File:2017-Parade-Map-bigger.jpg|alt=Downtown Milwaukee St Patrick Parade Route|thumb|Milwaukee St Patrick Parade Route Map]]

Mike Boyle returned in 2009, assisted by daughters Erin Boyle and Meghan Boyle. In 2012 and 2013, the parade was directed by Mike Boyle and Denis Donohoe. Killian's Irish Red, a [[MillerCoors]] brand, was the lead sponsor starting in 2013, and continuing in 2016. In 2014, Josh Walton took over the parade. The parade was again led by Michael Boyle in 2015, and continues under his leadership.

===2018 parade===
 The 2018 Parade will be the 52nd Annual Parade. It will be held on Saturday, March 10, 2018. It steps off at 3rd and Wisconsin at noon. The parade will run from 3rd and Wisconsin to Plankinton, north to Old World Third Street, then to Juneau Avenue, and down to Water Street, and from there to Highland Avenue, just north of the Marcus Center for the Arts. 

As it is both the 175th anniversary of the first St. Patrick Parade in Milwaukee, and the founding of the Milwaukee Archdiocese, Archbishop Jerome Listecki will be both the Grand Marshal and the celebrant at the 33rd Annual Mass in Honor of St. Patrick at St. Patrick's Church.

'''Nockherberg''' is the name of a small [[terrace (geology)|terrace]] on the slope of the eastern bank of the Isar in [[Munich]], situated in the urban district of [[Au (Munich)|Au]]. An annual [[beer festival]] rich in tradition takes place there in the [[Paulaner Brewery]] - the ''Salvator-Ausschank auf dem Nockherberg'' The name of the raised terrace is often used [[synonym]]ously for this festival or its opening event, the tapping of the first barrel of a strong, seasonal beer (''Starkbieranstich'').

== Origin and location ==
The name of the Nockherberg and two nearby streets can be traced back to the banking family Nockher. The family had settled in Munich in the 18th century and built a summer house on the eastern Isar heights in 1789, the so-called ‘Nockher palace’.&lt;ref name="Dollinger"&gt;[[Hans Dollinger]]: ''Die Münchner Straßennamen''. 4.&amp;nbsp;Auflage. Südwest, München 1999, {{ISBN|3-517-06115-8}}&lt;br /&gt;Zitiert nach: Heinz-Peter Meyer u.&amp;nbsp;a.:{{cite web |url=http://www.spd-muenchen-au.de/servlet/PB/menue/bezirksteil/au_strassen.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=January 29, 2017 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://archive.today/20080120144426/http://www.spd-muenchen-au.de/servlet/PB/menue/bezirksteil/au_strassen.htm |archivedate=January 20, 2008 |df= }}, 3.&amp;nbsp;Juni 2006&lt;br /&gt;Sowie nach: Bettina Messinger u.&amp;nbsp;a.: ''[http://www.auer-muehlbach.de/strassen/ Auer Mühlbach online]'', 29.&amp;nbsp;Mai 2006 (dort die 1.&amp;nbsp;Auflage)&lt;/ref&gt; It was located on the street known today as 'Am Nockherberg'.

The Nockherberg terrace is situated in the district of [[Au-Haidhausen]]. From the Nockherberg, (approx 535 m [[above sea level]]), the terrain descends north-west towards the [[Isar]] for approximately 20 metres. Below the hill, the street ‘Am Neudeck’ with the former [[:de:Justizvollzugsanstalt Neudeck|Neudeck]] correctional facility is located. To the north is the [[Mariahilfplatz]] and in a south-westerly direction the old Paulaner breweries.

[[File:Kronepark München.jpg|thumbnail|left|'Kronepark']]

From Neudeck, the road ‘Am Nockherberg’, formerly named Ohlmüller Street, snakes up the mountainside and merges into [[Bonifatius|Sankt Bonifatius]] Street at the top. The new brewery buildings between Reger Street in the east and Hoch Street in the west form the north-eastern part of the Nockherberg, with a rail connection to [[München Ost station]]. Hoch Street forks off Nockerberg street near the top and joins it again via the small ‘Zacherlweg’.

Across the street ‘Am Nockherberg’ from the new brewery area there is an urban park named 'Kronepark', which is situated on the south-western part of the hill and includes a playground. 'Kronepark' was built in 1958 on land owned by the former circus director [[:de:Carl Krone|Carl Krone]] and his widow [[Ida Krone]], who died in 1957.&lt;ref&gt;Peter Klimesch: ''Drunt in der grünen Au: Die Nockherstraße im Wandel der zeit''.

A social science research centre, the [[:de:Deutsches Jugendinstitut|German Youth Institute]] stands here. Columbus Square is situated at the south-western end of Nocker Street.

== The strong beer festival ==
[[File:Nockherberg München Starkbierfest 2007.jpg|thumbnail|''Salvator-Ausschank'', 2007]]

The strong beer festival takes place annually during [[Lent]] in the Paulaner main hall at Hoch Street 77. It starts around [[St Joseph's Day]] (19 March) and lasts for 17 days, the period being called the strong beer time or Munich's [[:de:Fünfte Jahreszeit|fifth season of the year]]. The festival is associated with the traditional ‘Holy Father Feast’ on April 2, commemorating [[Francis of Paola]], founder of the Paulaner [[religious order]].

With its [[:de:Biergarnitur|ale-benches]], light music and huge crowd of visitors, today's ''Salvator-Ausschank'' resembles the [[pole marquee]]s at the Munich [[Oktoberfest]]. On the Nockherberg, [[beer]] is not served in usual beer glasses, but in [[:de:Keferloher|Keferloher]], tankards made of robust earthenware. The sturdy tankards keep the beer cool longer and also make ‘undemonstrative’ refilling possible.&lt;ref&gt;[[Verein gegen betrügerisches Einschenken]] e.&amp;nbsp;V.: [http://openpr.de/news/81955 ''Nockherberg derbleckt Starkbier-Besucher. Kontrollergebnis: 100 % schlecht eingeschenkt''], 3.&amp;nbsp;Juni 2006 (Pressemitteilung vom 30.&amp;nbsp;März 2006)&lt;/ref&gt;

=== History ===

[[File:Franziskus von Paola.jpg|thumbnail|left|Francis of Paola]]

Serving strong beer at Lent can be traced back to a regulation from the religious order of the [[:de:Klöster in München#Paulanerkloster|Paulaner]] monastery in Neudeck ob der Au. The Paulaner [[Monasticism|monks]] have brewed beer in the monastery for their own consumption at least since 1634.  Their nutrition was, on principle, very modest, even more so during Lent, and therefore they were permitted to brew a stronger version of their ‘liquid bread’ during this time of fasting.  This strong beer, that has been brewed every year in spring since 1651, was named the ‘Holy Father Beer’ in honour of the founder of the order; later it was given the name ''[[Paulaner Brewery|Salvator]]'' beer.&lt;ref name="Weigl Au" /&gt; The monks later sold Salvator beer also to the public – mainly to supply the poor rural population with a nourishing drink during Lent, but also to supplement the monastery's income.

In the 18th century the [[electorate of Bavaria|Bavarian elector]] was habitually invited to the annual tapping of the first [[keg]] of strong beer on April 2 and he was served the first mug of beer. In a mandate dated 31 March 1751, elector [[Maximilian III Joseph, Elector of Bavaria|Maximilian III. Joseph]] explicitly permitted the public serving of beer on the feast day of Francis of Paola. On 26 February 1780, [[Charles Theodore, Elector of Bavaria|Karl Theodor]], elector of Bavaria since 1777, permitted the Paulaner monks to serve beer to the public year-round. The ‘Holy Father Feast’ of 1799, at which the whole court of elector [[Maximilian I Joseph of Bavaria|Maximilian IV. Joseph]] participated, was the city's largest [[Volksfest]] up to that date. However, that same year the monastery of Neudeck was disbanded. The brewery located opposite the monastery was expropriated in the course of [[secularisation]] and initially sold to the [[Sovereign Military Order of Malta]] in 1803.&lt;ref name="Weigl Au" /&gt;

&lt;!-- [[File:Nockherberg München Salvator-Ausschank 1890.jpg|thumbnail|''Salvator-Ausschank'' 1890]] --&gt;

In 1806, [[brewery#Head brewer/brewmaster|master brewer]] [[:de:Franz Xaver Zacherl|Franz Xaver Zacherl]] (1772–1849) took a lease on the Paulaner brewery and eventually purchased it in 1813, whereby the [[brewery]] became an ordinary commercial undertaking. 'Zacherlweg' at the Nockherberg is a street named after him.&lt;ref name="Dollinger" /&gt; Zacherl continued the tradition of annual strong-beer tapping on 2 April and the festive sale of beer (''Ausschank'') in the following [[Octave]] (eight days). Towards the middle of the 19th century, the first tapping shifted to March and the strong beer time was extended. In 1861, the ''Salvator-Ausschank'' started the Sunday before St. Joseph's Day and lasted for 12 days.&lt;ref name="Weigl Au" /&gt; Starting in 1858, the brewery arranged for performances by [[Gstanzl]] singers and [[:de:Volksschauspieler|popular folk actors]] to increase business. During the tapping in 1891, the first  "Salvator speech" was held. After an interruption from 1939 to 1950 due to [[World War II]], the strong beer festival reappeared in its present form, during which individual politicians were made fun of in clever speeches; the German term for being subjected to this kind of friendly insult is ''derbleckt''.

==== The 'Salvator Battle' of 1888 ====
The only violent event in the history of the town festival occurred on 23 May 1888, when a trivial quarrel turned into a mass brawl between [[soldier]]s and civilians. When an [[artillery|artillerist]] drew his sabre, a fight broke out in which walking-sticks and beer mugs were also put to good use, causing a relatively large number of injuries. The fight spread throughout the hall and into the garden. Neither the [[gendarmerie|gendarmes]] nor the jail guard from Neudeck could control the mob, so a 50-man unit of [[1st Royal Bavarian Heavy Cavalry (Prince Charles of Bavaria's)|Heavy Cavalry]] was called, who rode into the hall swinging their sabres. When the conflict broke out there had been only one gendarmerie sergeant on duty at the Nockherberg. In a later investigation this was considered the reason for the inability to control the [[Conflict escalation|escalation]]. It was also claimed that irritation caused by an increase in the price of Salvator beer was the underlying reason for the wrath of the festival guests. The 'scandal year' 1888 remained a topic of conversation in Munich for many years.&lt;ref&gt;Hannes Burger 1984, S.&amp;nbsp;60; ders. 1998, S.&amp;nbsp;17&amp;nbsp;f.;&lt;br /&gt;Herbert Burger: ''Der Skandal am Nockherberg.

The ''Salvator-Ausschank'' did not originally take place on the Nockherberg but in the old brewery at Neudeck, on the corner of Falken Street and Ohlmüller Street. In 1822, the ''Zacherlgarten'' inn was constructed on the grounds of the Paulaner garden to facilitate year-round drinking of Lent beer; it existed until 2008. From 1846 until 1860, beer was tapped in the so-called ''Neudecker Garden''&lt;ref name="Messinger"&gt;Bettina Messinger u.&amp;nbsp;a.: [http://www.auer-muehlbach.de/ ''Auer Mühlbach online''], 29. Mai 2006 (mit weiteren Hintergrundinformationen zu Landschaft und Brauerei)&lt;/ref&gt; on a field nearby. In 1858, banker Georg Nockher sold his summer residence on the Nockherberg to the Paulaner brewery (called "Zacherlbräu" at that time), and it was turned into a [[beer garden]].&lt;ref name="Dollinger" /&gt; Starting in spring 1861, beer was served only here in the new ''Zacherl-Keller'', renamed the ''Salvator-Keller'' in 1928.&lt;ref name="Weigl Au" /&gt; The inn ''Zum Nockhergarten'', the former Nockher palace (''Nockherschlösschen''), was razed in 1903/1904.&lt;ref name="Dollinger" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Richard Bauer]], Eva Graf: ''Nachbarschaften. Altmünchner Herbergsviertel und ihre Bewohner.'' 2. Auflage. Hugendubel, München 1985, {{ISBN|3-88034-246-6}}, S. 142.&lt;/ref&gt;

During [[World War II]] the brewery gallery with its massive arches was used as the command post of Munich's air-raid defence headquarters.&lt;ref&gt;Landeshauptstadt München: [http://www.muenchen.de/Stadtleben/Specials/Kulturgeschichtspfade/au_haidhausen/162419/06_auer_muehlbach.html ''Auer Mühlbach''], 29. Mai 2006&lt;/ref&gt; Part of the building was also made available to the public as a shelter. The cellar was completely destroyed during a [[strategic bombing|bombing raid]] on 24 April 1944. The new ''Salvator-Keller'', designed by professor [[Franz Zell]], reopened on 11 March 1950.

[[File:Nockherberg München Paulaner Haupteingang.jpg|thumbnail|left|links|''Paulaner am Nockherberg'', 2006]]

On 28 August 1965, the extreme right-wing [[National Democratic Party of Germany|NPD]] held its first federal party conference in the ''Salvator-Keller''.&lt;ref&gt;Axel Schildt: Rebellion und Reform. Die Bundesrepublik der Sechzigerjahre, Bonn 2005, S.&amp;nbsp;130&lt;/ref&gt; In the night of 27 to 28 November 1999, the cellar, now called ''Paulaner-Keller'', was almost entirely destroyed by arson. Firefighting operations with 89 fire engines lasted for two days. The resulting damage amounted to approximately 15 million euros. In spite of intensive efforts, the offender has so far not been identified amongst 650 suspects. In March 2004, 39-year-old Karl R., known as the "step-brother" of Nockherberg publican Peter Pongratz and relative of the [[Oktoberfest tents#Fischer-Vroni|Fischer-Vroni]] family, was remanded in custody as a suspect in the crime.&lt;ref name="SZ310304"&gt;[[Süddeutsche Zeitung]]: ''[http://www.sueddeutsche.de/muenchen/nockherberg-brand-feuer-wegen-privater-fehde-1.930556 Nockherberg-Brand – Feuer wegen privater Fehde].'' 31. März 2004.&lt;/ref&gt; However, he was released after a few months for lack of evidence.

In the years 2000 to 2002, the ''Salvator-Ausschank'' took place in a specially-built tent on the [[Mariahilfplatz]] below the Nockherberg. The ''Paulaner-Keller'' was torn down in 2001 and in 2003 replaced by a newly constructed above-ground Paulaner festive hall, which offers room for up to 2500 customers. The reconstruction cost around 25 million euros.&lt;ref name="SZ310304" /&gt; One of the rooms in the vaulted cellar of the new inn ''Paulaner am Nockherberg'' is now once again called the ''Salvatorkeller''. The fountain, famous from television advertising, is located in the beer garden, which has again been accessible since 2003.

=== Political kick-off: sampling the strong beer ===
The kick-off event of the annual ''Salvator-Ausschank'' is the tasting of the first strong beer of the "fifth season", attended by many regional and federal Bavarian politicians. Due to [[:de:BR Fernsehen|Bavarian Television broadcasts]] since 1982, the tapping of the strong beer keg on the Nockherberg and the subsequent program can be viewed by a wide audience. The television broadcast in 2004 had approximately 2.8 million viewers.&lt;ref&gt;[[Bayerischer Rundfunk]]: ''Geschäftsbericht 2004''. München 2005, S.&amp;nbsp;38 ({{cite web |url=http://www.br-online.de/br-intern/geschaeftsbericht/pdf/br-geschaeftsbericht-2004.pdf |title=PDF; 916&amp;nbsp;KB |accessdate=2006-05-30 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060627101309/http://www.br-online.de/br-intern/geschaeftsbericht/pdf/br-geschaeftsbericht-2004.pdf |archivedate=June 27, 2006 |df= }})&lt;/ref&gt; In 2015, the live-broadcast was followed by 2.8 million viewers Germany-wide, of which 2.05 million were Bavarian viewers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Starkbierprobe begeistert Publikum|trans-title=|periodical=|publisher=www.br.de|url=http://www.br.de/presse/inhalt/pressemitteilungen/nockherberg2015-quote-br-100.html|accessdate=2015-02-27|last=Detlev Klusak|date=2015-02-26|year=|month=|day=|language=German|pages=|quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:J Puschkin Starkbierprobe.jpg|thumbnail|Historic beer tasting]]

The event begins with an actual [[Beer sommelier#Beer tasting|beer tasting]]. The first [[Maß]], which was originally presented to the prince-elector, has been handed to the Bavarian [[minister-president]] since 1965. The head of the brewery passes him the mug with the traditional words: ''Salve [[pater patriae]]! Bibas, princeps optime!'' ([[Latin|lat.]] "Be welcome, father of the fatherland! Drink, best prince!"). However, the present "father of the nation" is not expected to carry out the traditional Salvator test, which would not function anyway because the recipe has been modified; originally, Lenten beer was considered to be strong enough only if a bench drenched with the beer would adhere to a person's [[Lederhose]]n when he attempted to stand up.

The highlight of the event is the ''[[:de:Derblecken|Derblecken]]'' of politicians, a political cabaret in front of invited guests, consisting of a speech followed by a [[Singspiel]]. In both contributions current Munich issues as well as sharp commentaries on regional and federal politics are presented in cleverly worded ironic statements and more or less heavy sideswipes aimed at politicians of all parties. For a Bavarian politician, not being "derbleckt", meaning not being taken for a ride in the festive contributions, can almost be interpreted as a sign of one's irrelevance or lack of a distinctive personality.

{{Quote|It's true, Mr. Rothemund, that you know 70 percent of the electorate, that's why it was the other 30 percent who voted for you. (Hannes Burger ''derbleckt'' the Bavarian chairman of the SPD, Helmut Rothemund in the 1983 Nockerberg Lent "sermon")}}

In 1991, the Nockerberg beer festival was cancelled due to the [[Gulf War]], and in 2003 due to the [[Iraq War]]. In 2009 the event was scheduled for 12 March but postponed to the end of the ''Salvator-Ausschank'' period on 2 April because of the [[Winnenden school shooting]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Bayerischer Rundfunk]]: ''{{cite web |url=http://www.br-online.de/bayern/feste-und-feiern/nockherberg-DID1188597559/nockherberg-2009-verschiebung-ID1237884484491.xml |title=Archived copy |accessdate=June 7, 2016 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://archive.today/20090327100526/http://www.br-online.de/bayern/feste-und-feiern/nockherberg-DID1188597559/nockherberg-2009-verschiebung-ID1237884484491.xml |archivedate=March 27, 2009 |df= }} 24.

==== Tradition of ''Derblecken'' ====

''[[:de:Derblecken|Derblecken]]'' ([[Bavarian language|Bavarian]] for 'making fun of someone') can be traced back to the tradition of an innkeeper greeting his guests. In former times he was apt to know all the villagers by name and was quite familiar with the all the local stories and [[Rumor|rumours]]. Regular guests were frequently teased with those stories by humorous and self-confident innkeepers. For events where the guests were to be welcomed in a similar way, [[rhetoric]]ally less talented innkeepers or hosts ordered professional [[:de:Hochzeitsbitter|Hochzeitslader]] or [[Gstanzl]] singers who informed themselves about the guests' peculiarities and sensitivities beforehand. The victims of mockery were expected to take it with good grace, since any offense taken would give rise to even greater public amusement.&lt;ref name="Hannes Burger Derblecken"&gt;Hannes Burger 1998, S.&amp;nbsp;63,&amp;nbsp;15&lt;/ref&gt;

This tradition is still cultivated today. Since the 'victims' are invited guests, overly rude or insulting criticism, which would reflect on the host (or the brewery itself) is prohibited. Consequently, the authors of the festive contributions strive to put forth particularly critical 'attacks' indirectly, with clever wording, or with a wink.&lt;ref name="Hannes Burger Derblecken" /&gt;

==== Commemorative speech ====
[[File:Bruno Jonas.jpg|thumbnail|Bruno Jonas, speaker&amp;nbsp;2004–2006]]

The first Salvator speaker was humourist [[Jakob Geist]] in 1891. In 1922 he was followed by actor [[Weiß Ferdl]], master of ceremonies [[Adolf Gondrell]], Gstanzl singer [[Roider Jackl]] and radio host [[Emil Vierlinger]], who organised the [[radio broadcasting]] of the ''Derblecken'' on the Nockherberg after World War II. After his serious illness in the 1970s, [[Michl Lang]], [[Klaus Havenstein]], [[Franz Schönhuber]], [[Ernst Maria Lang]], and finally the actor and Paulaner spokesperson [[Walter Sedlmayr]] (1982–1990) took over.

From 1992 to 2010 the speakers (with the exception of 2007) performed the role of the monk Bruder Barnabas, who holds a Lenten "sermon" for the guests. The role can be traced back to the Paulaner monk [[Friar]] Barnabas (1750–1795), whose original name was Valentin Stephan Still. He became a master brewer in Munich in 1774 and is said to have invented the basic recipe for the modern Salvator strong beer.

The first Salvator speaker who performed in the historical role of Brother Barnabas was Max Grießer (1992–1996), followed by [[Erich Hallhuber]] (1997–1998). Hallhuber insisted on being permitted to change the text of speechwriter Hannes Burger, while Burger himself insisted on a verbatim performance of his text. Due to this argument Hallhuber cancelled his performance at short notice in 1999. His successor Gerd Fischer (1999–2003) presented his sermons in a tone that benevolently pitied those he ''derbleckt''. With the cabaret artist [[Bruno Jonas]] (2004–2006) the Lenten sermons again became more sharp-tongued.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.welt.de/print/welt_kompakt/vermischtes/article13907626/Im-Nebensatz-ein-kleines-feines-Watscherl.html |title=Im Nebensatz ein kleines, feines Watscherl |publisher=Die Welt |date=2012-03-07 |accessdate=2013-11-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2007, the Lower Bavarian cabaret artist [[Django Asül]] gave the Salvator speech without a cowl.&lt;ref&gt;[[Süddeutsche Zeitung]]: ''[http://www.sueddeutsche.de/muenchen/nockherberg-django-asuel-wird-neuer-fastenprediger-1.756631 Nockherberg – Django Asül wird neuer Fastenprediger].'' 22. Januar 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; From 2008 to 2010, the former [[Edmund Stoiber]]-double [[Michael Lerchenberg]] gave the Lenten sermon again in the role of Brother Barnabas.&lt;ref&gt;[[Spiegel Online]]: ''[http://www.spiegel.de/politik/deutschland/nockherberg-derblecken-stoiber-double-wird-fastenprediger-a-505310.html Nockherberg-Derblecken: Stoiber-Double wird Fastenprediger].'' 12. September 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

The author Hannes Burger wrote the "commemorative" ''Derblecken'' speeches for 22 years, from 1982 until 2003.&lt;ref&gt;PNP-Online:{{cite web |url=http://www.pnp.de/news/boulevard/regional/03/nockherberg/main.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=January 29, 2017 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20040117040559/http://www.pnp.de/news/boulevard/regional/03/nockherberg/main.htm |archivedate=January 17, 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since 2004 the speakers have written their own texts. In the years 2008 to 2010, cabaret artist [[Christian Springer]] was co-author of the Lenten sermons. He resigned as ''Derblecker'', as did speaker Michael Lechrenberg, after some public figures, including [[Guido Westerwelle]], [[Christine Haderthauer]], and [[Charlotte Knobloch]] were offended by the content of their sermons.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.dradio.de/dlf/vorschau/ Deutschlandfunk, Sendung Querköpfe, 18.

März 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

Since 2011 [[Luise Kinseher]] has given the Salvator speech (status: 2016). She is the first female to do so.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.augsburger-allgemeine.de/bayern/Die-erste-Frau-auf-dem-Nockherberg-id8904886.html Die erste Frau auf dem Nockherberg], Augsburger Allgemeine, retrieved, 15 November 2010&lt;/ref&gt; She performs in the role of [[Bavaria statue|Mama Bavaria]], whom she personified during the ''Singspiel'' in 2010.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sueddeutsche.de/muenchen/starkbieranstich-auf-dem-nockherberg-hinterfotzige-streicheleinheiten-1.1076411 Wolfgang Görl: ''Hinterfotzige Streicheleinheiten''], Süddeutsche Zeitung, 23. März 2011; retrieved, 24 Märch 2011)&lt;/ref&gt;

==== ''Singspiel'' ====
The commemorative speech is followed by the ''Salvatorspiel'' in which numerous politicians are parodied. Until 1985 the singspiel was stage-managed by [[Olf Fischer]], then, until 1988, by the leading [[Bayerischer Rundfunk|BR]] entertainment head Helmut Kirchhammer, who also guided the team of authors. Until 2009, under the direction of Eva Demmelhuber, the singing cabaret was gradually expanded into a real stage performance with a new theme and stage setting every year. In the year 2010 [[Alfons Biedermann]] took over the direction. For the first time newly composed songs were provided by [[Matin Lingnau]] (music) and [[Heiko Wohlgemuth]] (texts).

One of the main authors of the Salvatorspiel was [[Holger Paetz]] from 1999 to 2009, who also portrayed FDP politician [[Guido Westerwelle]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Süddeutsche Zeitung]]: ''[http://www.sueddeutsche.de/muenchen/abschied-vom-nockherberg-das-wars-dann-1.402011 Abschied vom Nockherberg – „Das war’s dann“].'' 6. April 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; Particularly well known actors were also [[Walter Fitz]] as [[Franz Josef Strauß]], [[Michael Lerchenberg]] as [[Edmund Stoiber]], co-author [[Ulli Bauer]] as Munich's mayor [[Christian Ude]], [[Corinna Duhr]] as [[Angela Merkel]], as well as [[Veronika Fitz]], [[Georg Blädel]], André Hartmann, [[Max Grießer]], and [[Klaus Havenstein]]. After the singspiel the attendant politicians were photographed by the cameras of the journalists and television stations together with the actors who parodied them. The singspiel has been show-managed by [[Marcus H. Rosenmüller]] since 2013.

=== Artistic appreciation ===
[[File:Eduard Ille Kredenz-Szene.jpg|thumbnail|Frater Barnabas offers Salvator beer to Elector Karl Theodor, painting by [[Eduard Ille]]]]

The traditional Salvator festival inspired numerous artists in Munich. Poems and drawings with the strong beer and the serving of this on the Nockherberg as a motif abounded, many of which can be found in the brewery's guestbook, or were published in Munich magazines, including input from well-known authors such as [[Karl Valentin]] and [[Paul Heyse]]. The [[operetta]] ''Salvator'' (music by Theo Rupprecht, text by Max Ferner, Philipp Wichand and {{Interlanguage link multi|Michail Alexandrowitsch Weikone|de}}) premiered in Munich in 1911 featuring Father Barnabas as a central character, and served as the model for the 1952 film ''[[Monks, Girls and Hungarian Soldiers]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{IMDb title|tt0044945|Mönche, Mädchen und Panduren}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Hannes Burger 1984, S.&amp;nbsp;67–74&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Eduard Ille]] (1823–1900), painter, illustrator, caricaturist, and author from Munich become a Salvator poet. In many contributions to the humorous magazine [[Fliegende Blätter]] he glamourized Salvator beer and its 'founder' Father Barnabas. In the following poem he describes the electoral beer tasting, which took place in March. It can almost be considered a hymn to Lenten beer.&lt;ref&gt;Hannes Burger 1984, S.&amp;nbsp;45,&amp;nbsp;69; ders. 1998, S.&amp;nbsp;14,&amp;nbsp;18&amp;nbsp;f.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Translated from the original ("Judica" was Passion Sunday,the 5th Sunday of Lent):

&lt;poem style="margin-left:2em; font-style:italic;"&gt;
War im März gen [[Judica]] / wiederum der Frühling nah,
kam – zu ehren alte Sitten – / der Herr Kurfürst selbst geritten
auf die Neudeck ob der Au / zum Paulaner-Klosterbau.
Dort empfing den Landesvater / Barnabas, der Bräuhausfrater,
ihm beglückt und freudeglänzend / einen Humpen Bier kredenzend
mit dem Gruß, der bis zur Stunde / sich erhielt im Volkesmunde:
„[[Salve (Gruß)|Salve]], [[pater patriae]]! / Bibas, princeps optime!“
&lt;/poem&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;poem style="margin-left:2em; font-style:italic;"&gt;
When in March nigh Passion Sunday / springtime once again was near,
rode – to honour an old custom – / he himself, our Lord Elector 
up to Neudeck ob der Au, / Paulaner brewery was his goal.
There our sovereign Lord was greeted / by Barnabas, the brewery monk,
who with delight and full of joy / offered him a mug of beer 
with a greeting that evermore / a common saying did remain:
"Salve, pater patriae! / Bibas, princeps optime!"
&lt;/poem&gt;

== Other aspects of the site ==

The high terrain at the Nockherberg, which was formed almost 10,000 years ago, provided not only a safe location and storage place for the population of Au but also a supply of water and energy which they used in creative ways, not only for breweries.

=== Formation and geology ===

In the [[Tertiary]], a sea periodically extended from the foot of the [[Alps]] to the highlands of the [[Bavarian Forest]]. This sea was filled increasingly with weathering material from the Alps. The finest and youngest deposition layer of the Tertiary ([[molasse|upper fresh water molasse]] of the [[Miocene]]), the [[:de:Flinz#Flinz der Oberen Süßwassermolasse|Flinz]], now forms a water runoff, known as a [[soil horizon]], which retains groundwater. For this reason springs emerge from the hillsides in the Isartal at several places in Munich, as can be observed at Spring Street, beneath the northern Hoch Street.&lt;ref name="Messinger" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Weigl Kyesinga"&gt;Johann Peter Weigl: ''Kyesinga – Das Dorf Giesing''.

Aumeier, München 1979, S.&amp;nbsp;30–50 (S.&amp;nbsp;33,&amp;nbsp;35)&lt;/ref&gt; These springs played an important role in the drinking water supply of the local population at least until the beginning of the 20th century.&lt;ref&gt;Richard Bauer, Eva Graf: ''Nachbarschaften. Altmünchner Herbergsviertel und ihre Bewohner''. 2.&amp;nbsp;Auflage. Hugendubel, München 1985, S.&amp;nbsp;108, {{ISBN|3-88034-246-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Nockherberg München Aufstieg.jpg|thumbnail|From Kolumbusplatz via 'Am Bergsteig' to the Nockherberg]]

During the [[ice age]]s of the [[Quaternary]], [[glacier]]s and meltwater covered the Flinz with rough erosion- and weathering material from the Alps, which formed the [[:de:Münchener Schotterebene|Munich gravel plain]]. Since further erosion occurred, only the last two gravel layers remained in the Giesinger region. The Giesinger gravel area formed terraces, along with the neighbouring [[Untergiesing-Harlaching|Harlachinger]] gravel area four to ten metres higher. Towards the end of the last ice age, approximately 10,000 years ago, the Isar dug its present valley, known as the Au, out of these terraces. Thus, beside the sloping edge along Nockherberg and Hoch street, further uplands in this area, for example the Drum mountain with the ramp of Candid Street, 'Am Bergsteig' and the Giesinger mountain, emerged as well. Since the steep street gradients of over 12% constructed there proved to be a significant traffic obstruction, several elaborate slope modifications were undertaken between 1890 and 1935. At the Nockherberg, the re-design took place in the years 1904/1905, whereby the former Nocker palace was demolished.&lt;ref name="Weigl Kyesinga" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Folker Dohr:{{cite web |url=http://www.muenchen.de/Rathaus/rgu/vorsorge_schutz/grundwasser/gw_situation/isohypsen_1984/88672/index.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=January 29, 2017 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://archive.today/20050820142900/http://www.muenchen.de/Rathaus/rgu/vorsorge_schutz/grundwasser/gw_situation/isohypsen_1984/88672/index.html |archivedate=August 20, 2005 |df= }}, 18.

Between approximately 1150 and 1301, the lords of Giesing were said to have had a [[manor]]house at the Nockherberg near today's Ruhe Street. Ownership of the estate at the Nockherberg can be traced from the 15th century up to the time of its sale to the Nockher family on 13 July 1789.&lt;ref name="Weigl Au" /&gt;

Today, water for brewing is provided by wells which have a depth of 210–240 m.

The [[Auer Mühlbach]], a tributary of the Isar, runs between Nockherberg and Neudeuck and has appeared above ground at this location only since 2002. The formerly wild stream has played a significant role in providing energy since the Middle Ages,.&lt;ref name="Weigl Au" /&gt; In 1816 it drove a total of 60 [[water wheel]]s in the Au. From 1881, this urban stream was used to power the [[chiller]] invented by [[Carl von Linde]]. This ice machine made it possible for the Paulander brewery to brew beer year-round, and it can still be viewed today.&lt;ref name="Messinger" /&gt;

'''The North Melbourne Grand Final Breakfast''' is a breakfast function organised by the [[North Melbourne Football Club]] on the morning of the [[AFL Grand Final]]. The breakfast marks the traditional beginning to Grand Final day and is one of the biggest social highlights on the Australian sporting calendar. Watching the event is a ritual for many footy fans and the function plays a huge role in the pre match build up for the Grand Final.

==History==
The first Grand Final Breakfast was held in 1967 at the Southern Cross hotel, as a valuable fundraising event. The inaugural guest speaker was the VFL's Administrative director [[Eric McCutchan]]. The event rose to prominence in the 1970s when the breakfast began to be televised across [[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria]], and was officially endorsed by the VFL as the official pre-match Grand Final function. Since then the event has grown into a significant money raiser for North Melbourne, and the guest list has grown to include Prime Ministers, State Premiers and other celebrities.&lt;ref&gt;The Clubs – The Complete History of Every Club in the VFL/AFL {{ISBN|0-670-87858-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Event==

Although many clubs hold their own [[Grand Final Breakfast]]s, the North Melbourne Breakfast was the first breakfast and is currently the only breakfast to be officially endorsed by the [[Australian Football League|AFL]]. This ensures a guest list that reads as a 'who's who' of Australian business, sport, entertainment and politics. The breakfast includes a Grand Auction, with all proceeds being donated to the Starlight Children's Foundation.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.starlight.org.au/WhatsOn/Pages/AFLGrandFinalBreakfast.aspx&lt;/ref&gt;

==Quotes==

Former Prime Minister Bob Hawke described the event as
“one of this nation’s great traditions”.

Paul Keating referred to the function as
“a tradition in itself”

Prime Minister John Howard described it as
“a tremendous institution …. and the most eclectic gathering of people you could possibly imagine”. &lt;ref&gt;https://web.archive.org/web/20020808135032/http://www.thegrandfinalbreakfast.com.au/index.cfm?link=moreinfo&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Ozora Festival''', stylised as '''O.Z.O.R.A.''', is an annual [[psychedelic trance]] and [[arts festival]] in the [[Hungary|Hungarian]] village of [[Ozora]].

== History and growth ==
The festival has been held on an estate in Ozora near the small village of [[Dádpuszta]] every year since 2004.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://ozorafestival.eu |title=O.Z.O.R.A. Festival}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first modern music festival held in Ozora was called ''Solipse'' and took place during the [[Solar eclipse of August 11, 1999]]. ''Solipse'' did not get a sequel until the first Ozora Festival was held in 2004.

The Ozora Festival is one of the two sizeable psytrance festivals in Hungary (the other being Solar United Natives festival), and is one of the largest [[psychedelic trance]] festivals in the world. As of 2016, it annually attracts close to 60,000 people,&lt;ref name="RTL"&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://www.rtl.be/info/magazine/culture/bienvenue-au-festival-ozora-le-tomorrowland-hongrois-a-l-esprit-tres-hippie-photos--851185.aspx |title=Bienvenue au festival Ozora, un "Tomorrowland" hongrois à l'esprit très hippie |work=[[RTL Group|RTL.be]] |date=15 September 2016 |accessdate=25 August 2018 |language=fr}}&lt;/ref&gt; similar to [[Boom Festival]] in Portugal and [[Antaris Project]] in Germany who also reach more than 40,000 visitors every year.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/music/2017/dec/06/from-bush-doof-to-clowncore-your-favourite-underground-music-scenes |title=From bush doof to clowncore: your favourite underground music scenes |author=Jimmy Bricks |work=[[The Guardian]] |date=6 December 2017 |accessdate=24 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Kaarlo Pentti Linkola''' (born 7 December 1932) is a radical [[Finland|Finnish]] [[Deep ecology|deep ecologist]],&lt;ref&gt;Mika LaVaque-Manty, [https://books.google.com/books?id=eOGHPaT9FWIC&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;pg=PA159#v=onepage&amp;q=&amp;f=false "Arguments and fists: political agency and justification in liberal theory"], Routledge, 2002, p. 159&lt;/ref&gt; [[Ornithology|ornithologist]],&lt;ref name ="Harris"/&gt; polemicist, naturalist, writer and fisherman. He has written widely about his ideas and in Finland is a prominent, and highly controversial, thinker.&lt;ref name="Schoolfield"&gt;George C. Schoolfield, "A history of Finland's literature", U of Nebraska Press, 1998, p. 271&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Henry Minde, Svein Jentoft, Harald Gaski, [https://books.google.com/books?id=aVJyN5ZAHeUC&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;pg=PA100#v=onepage&amp;q=&amp;f=false "Indigenous peoples: self-determination, knowledge, indigeneity"], Eburon Uitgeverij B.V., 2008, p. 100&lt;/ref&gt; Linkola was a year-round fisherman from 1959 to 1995. He has fished on [[Keitele]], [[Päijänne]] and [[Gulf of Finland]], and since 1978 he fishes on [[Vanajavesi]].

Linkola blames humans for the continuous [[degradation of the environment]]. He promotes rapid population decline in order to combat the problems commonly attributed to [[Human overpopulation|overpopulation]].&lt;ref name="Schoolfield"/&gt;

==Life==
Linkola grew up in Helsinki, spending his summers in the countryside at the farm of his grandfather [[Hugo Suolahti]]. His father [[Kaarlo Linkola]] was a botanist and [[phytogeography|phytogeographer]] and the [[Rector (academia)|Rector]] of [[Helsinki University]], and his grandfather had worked as the [[chancellor]] of that same university. Pentti Linkola chose not to continue his [[zoology|zoological]] and [[botany|botanical]] studies after his first year. 

Linkola is considered one of Finland's most famous [[Ornithology|ornithologists]], but gave up his research career to live an austere life as a fisherman.&lt;ref name ="Harris"/&gt;

==Ideas==
Linkola believes that democracy is a mistake and only radical change can prevent [[ecological collapse]].&lt;ref name ="Harris"&gt;{{cite book |last= Harris|first=Paul G.|date=2009 |title=Environmental Change and Foreign Policy: Theory and Practice|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=HQl5AgAAQBAJ&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;pg=PA125#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|publisher=[[Routledge]]|page=125 |isbn=9781134014811}}&lt;/ref&gt; He contends that the human populations of the world, regardless if they are developed or underdeveloped, do not deserve to survive at the expense of the [[biosphere]] as a whole.&lt;ref&gt;''Humanflood'' by Pentti Linkola. Translated by Harri Heinonen and [[Michael Jenkins Moynihan|Michael Moynihan]]. Originally published in ''Apocalypse Culture II'', ed. [[Adam Parfrey]] ([[Feral House]], 2000). pp. 436–451. {{ISBN|0922915571}}&lt;/ref&gt; In May 1994, Linkola was featured on the front page of ''[[The Wall Street Journal Europe]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The best of The Public square: selections from Richard John Neuhaus' celebrated column in First things |last=Neuhaus |first=Richard John |authorlink=Richard John Neuhaus |page=61 |publisher=Institute on Religion and Public Life |year=1997 |isbn=0-9659507-0-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; He said he was for a radical reduction in the world population and was quoted as saying about a future world war, "If there were a button I could press, I would sacrifice myself without hesitating, if it meant millions of people would die."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=A Strange Finnish Thinker Posits War, Famine as Ultimate 'Goods'|first=Dana |last=Milbank|work=The Wall Street Journal Asia |date=24 May 1994|page=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Linkola's writings describe in emotional detail the [[environmental degradation]] he has witnessed. He dedicated his 1979 ''Toisinajattelijan päiväkirjasta'' (''From the Diary of a Dissident'') to [[Andreas Baader]] and [[Ulrike Meinhof]], stating that "they are the signposts, not Jesus of Nazareth or Albert Schweitzer."&lt;ref name ="Harris"/&gt;

Paul G. Harris, Chair Professor of Global and Environmental Studies at the Education University of Hong Kong, contends that while most environmentalists in Finland have distanced themselves from Linkola, those concerned about the environment avidly read his writings. Harris asserts that Linkola represents "a very Finnish and dark version of 'an inconvenient truth'."&lt;ref name ="Harris"/&gt;

In 1995, Linkola founded the [[Finnish Nature Heritage Foundation]] (''Luonnonperintösäätiö''). It concentrates on preserving the few [[ancient forest]]s still left in southern Finland and other [[nature conservation]]. The forests are donated to the foundation.

"'''Photograph'''" is a song recorded by [[Canada|Canadian]] [[Rock music|rock]] band [[Nickelback]]. It was released in September 2005 as the first single from their fifth studio album, ''[[All the Right Reasons]]''. The song made multiple US and UK top 10 charts, peaking at #1 in several of them.

==Music video==
The [[music video]] begins with [[Chad Kroeger]], the video's protagonist, walking along a lonely, sparsely populated street, holding up a photograph of himself and Nickelback's producer, [[Joey Moi]] (who is referred to in the line "And what the hell is on Joey's head?"). As the song progresses to the line "And this is where I grew up," he walks to a rusty mailbox, addressed as number 29025. As he speaks of sneaking out, the camera does not show the house itself but does show a view from the inside looking out at him, possibly suggesting someone else lives there now. He continues walking and comes to an older building marked as "Hanna High School" on the front (it's now the Community Services Building: 210 6 Avenue East, Hanna, Alberta, Canada) announcing, "And this is where I went to school." He and his three other band members enter the gym with their gear and put on a seemingly impromptu concert alone. During the chorus, two band members go to an old junkyard and reminisce about a field where the rest of the band and their girlfriends are partying. Another experiences a similar event near an abandoned train yard, seeing his old girlfriend (most likely Kim, who was "the first girl I kissed") run near the tracks and kiss his younger self. The [[Hanna roundhouse|Hanna Roundhouse]] is shown. The camera then switches to flashbacks of various people ("I miss that town, I miss the faces") As the video ends, the flashback people get in their cars to go home as the band finishes the song.

The video was directed by [[Nigel Dick]] and was filmed in [[Hanna, Alberta]], [[Canada]], hometown to the majority of the band.

== Chart performance ==
The single became the band's third top ten hit in the [[United States]], peaking at number 2 on the ''[[Billboard magazine|Billboard]]'' [[Billboard Hot 100|Hot 100]] chart. (Held from the top spot by [[Kanye West]]'s "[[Gold Digger (Kanye West song)|Gold Digger]]") "Photograph" has sold over 1.4 million digital downloads in the U.S., according to Nielsen SoundScan, though it is certified Gold by the [[RIAA]].{{Citation needed|date=February 2011}}  "Photograph", was the first of three top ten hits from ''[[All the Right Reasons]]'' in [[New Zealand]], peaking at number 4.

The song also topped the Billboard [[Mainstream Rock Tracks]] and [[Pop 100]] charts.
The single was also a huge success on the Canadian charts, peaking at number-one and staying there for seven weeks.

In 2008, the single was once again showing on future single release lists in the UK. The single was re-released on 23 June 2008&lt;ref&gt;[http://hmv.com/hmvweb/displayProductDetails.do?ctx=280;-1;-1;-1&amp;sku=819413 "Photograph" UK re-release date]&lt;/ref&gt; to capitalise on the success of "[[Rockstar (Nickelback song)|Rockstar]]". "Photograph" was added to the C-list at [[BBC Radio 1]] on 21 May 2008, climbing to the B-list the following week, and then to the A-List. It was also added to the BBC Radio 2 C-list. "Photograph" originally peaked at number 29 upon its first release, three years earlier. The song re-entered the [[UK Singles Chart]] at number 52 on 10 June 2008, climbed to number 29 a week later and reached a peak of number 18, two weeks after the physical release, outpeaking the original release of the song.

'''Provisional Irish Republican Army arms importation''' into the [[Republic of Ireland]] for use in [[Northern Ireland]] began in the early 1970s. With these weapons it conducted an [[Provisional IRA campaign 1969-1997|armed campaign against the British state in Northern Ireland]].&lt;ref&gt;''War in the Shadows: The Guerrilla in History Volume 2'' by Robert B. Asprey ({{ISBN|978-0595225941}}), page 1125&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Global Geopolitics: A Critical Introduction'' by Klaus Dodds ({{ISBN|978-0273686095}}), page 205&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''British Civilization'' by John Oakland ({{ISBN|978-0415261500}}), page 108&lt;/ref&gt;

==American arms==

In the early stages of the [[Troubles]], during the period 1969–1972, the [[Provisional IRA]] was poorly armed. They had access to weapons remaining from the IRA's failed [[Border Campaign (IRA)|Border Campaign]] between 1956 and 1962, but these weapons were outdated and unsuitable for a modern campaign.&lt;ref name="mult"&gt;{{cite book | last = Taylor | first = Peter | authorlink = Peter Taylor (Journalist) | title = Provos The IRA &amp; Sinn Féin | publisher = [[Bloomsbury Publishing]] | year = 1997 | doi =  | isbn = 0-7475-3818-2 | page = 52 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

After 1969, and the split with the [[Official IRA]], the Provisional IRA gained control of a majority of the stockpiled weaponry still held from previous IRA campaigns. They found that the stockpiles consisted mostly of [[World War II]] small arms ranging from [[Lee–Enfield]] and [[M1 Garand rifle|M1 Garand]] and [[M1 carbine]] rifles, to [[MP40]] and [[Thompson submachine gun]]s (SMG), plus [[Bren]] [[light machine guns]] (LMG) and [[Webley Revolver|Webley]] revolvers.&lt;ref&gt;Taylor, p. 62.&lt;/ref&gt; The Garands were used in IRA operations as late as the summer of 1976, when a [[British army]] patrol in [[County Armagh|South Armagh]] was fired on by one of these rifles loaded with armour-piercing ammunition.&lt;ref&gt;Bramley, Vincent (2012). ''Two Sides of Hell''. John Blake, p. 57. {{ISBN|184454821X}}&lt;/ref&gt;

To continue and escalate their armed campaign, the IRA needed to be better equipped, which meant securing modern small arms. In previous campaigns weapons had been secured before hostilities commenced via raids on British Army and even [[Irish Army]] weapons depots.{{citation needed|date=July 2018}} In the 1969–1971 period this was no longer feasible.&lt;ref&gt;Previous raids included the 1940 [[Christmas Raid]], the 1953 [[Felstead Raid]], and the 1955 [[Hazebrouck Raid]].&lt;/ref&gt; By 1972, the IRA had large quantities of modern small arms, particularly [[Armalite]] rifles, manufactured and purchased in the United States. The [[AR-18]] rifle in particular was found to be very well suited for [[guerrilla warfare]] as its small size and folding stock meant that it was easy to conceal. Moreover, it was capable of rapid fire and fired a high velocity round which provided great "[[stopping power]]".&lt;ref name="tp108"&gt;Taylor, pp. 108–109.&lt;/ref&gt;

The IRA's main gun runner in the United States was [[George Harrison (Irish Republican)|George Harrison]], an IRA veteran, resident in [[New York City|New York]] since 1938. Harrison bought guns for the IRA from a [[Corsica]]n arms dealer named [[George de Meo]], who had connections in organised crime. [[Joe Cahill]] acted as the contact between [[NORAID]] and Harrison. In 1971, the [[Royal Ulster Constabulary]] (RUC) had already seized 700 modern weapons from the IRA, including 2 tonnes of high explosive and 157,000 rounds of ammunition, most of which were of American manufacture.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = English | first = Richard | authorlink = | title = Armed Struggle: The History of the IRA | publisher = [[Pan Books]] | year = 2003 | pages = 114–115 | doi =  | isbn = 0-330-49388-4 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:AR-18.jpg|thumb|left|300px|The Armalite [[AR-18]] – obtained by the IRA from the United States in the early 1970s and an emotive symbol of its armed campaign]]

Harrison spent an estimated US$1 million in the 1970s purchasing over 2,500 guns for the IRA.&lt;ref name="mp16"&gt;{{cite book | last = Moloney | first = Ed | authorlink = Ed Moloney | title = A Secret History of the IRA | publisher = [[Penguin Books]] | year = 2002 | doi =  | isbn = 0-14-101041-X | page = 16}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to [[Brendan Hughes]], an IRA member who later became [[Officer Commanding]] of the IRA inside [[Long Kesh]] prison, the IRA smuggled small arms from the United States by sea on ''[[RMS Queen Elizabeth 2|''Queen Elizabeth 2'']]'' from New York via [[Southampton]],&lt;ref name="tp108"/&gt; through Irish members of her crew, until the network was cracked down on by the [[Federal Bureau of Investigation]] (FBI) in the 1980s.&lt;ref&gt;[[Tony Geraghty|Geraghty, Tony]] (2000). ''The Irish War''. Johns Hopkins University Press, p. 172. {{ISBN|0-00-255617-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; These ''Queen Elizabeth 2'' shipments included [[M16 rifle|M16]], [[CAR-15]], [[AR-18]] and [[AR-15]] [[Armalite]] rifles, accompanied by [[Browning Arms Company|Browning]] pistols and [[Smith &amp; Wesson]] pistols and revolvers and were driven from Southampton to [[Belfast]] in small consignments.{{citation needed|date=April 2011}}

In the late 1970s, another IRA member, [[Gabriel Megahey]], was sent to the United States to acquire more arms and he was able to procure more AR-15 Armalites, plus a number of [[Heckler &amp; Koch]] rifles and other weapons. Again, the purchase of these weapons was funded by [[Irish American]] republicans.&lt;ref name="tp15"&gt;Taylor, pp. 1–5.&lt;/ref&gt; A batch of [[M60 machine guns]] was imported in 1977.&lt;ref&gt;P400 Martin Dillon, ''The Dirty War: Covert Strategies and Tactics Used in Political Conflicts'' Taylor &amp; Francis, 1999 {{ISBN|0-415-92281-X}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Harrison was arrested by the FBI in 1981, but acquitted at his trial.&lt;ref name="mp16"/&gt; Megahey was arrested by the FBI in 1982 after a successful [[sting operation]], where he was trying to purchase [[surface-to-air missile]]s (SAMs) for the IRA, and sentenced to seven years in prison.&lt;ref name="tp15"/&gt;

In 1984, the FBI warned the Republic of Ireland that a major IRA arms shipment was underway from the United States, and that the weaponry would be transferred to an Irish fishing trawler in the Atlantic. Subsequently, Irish authorities discovered that arms ship was a vessel named ''Marita Ann'', allegedly after a tip off from [[Sean O'Callaghan]], a [[Garda Síochána]] intelligence agent within the IRA.&lt;ref name="mp16"/&gt; Three [[Irish Naval Service]] ships confronted the vessel off the coast of [[County Kerry]], and prevented its escape by firing warning shots. A team of naval personnel and Garda officers boarded the ship, arresting the crew of five and confiscating seven tons of military equipment, as well as medications, training manuals, and communications equipment.&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.rte.ie/tv/scannal/scannalbostonenglish.html Scannal: Boston]" [[RTÉ Television]]&lt;/ref&gt; The weapons had been donated by the South Boston [[Winter Hill gang|Winter Hill]] [[Irish Mob]].

==Libyan arms==&lt;!-- This section is linked from [[Bombing of Libya (April 1986)]] --&gt;
The other source of IRA arms in the 1970s was the leader of the [[History of Libya under Muammar Gaddafi|Libyan Arab Republic]], [[Muammar Gaddafi]], who was engaging in a strategy at this time of opposing the United States' hegemony over the Arab world by sponsoring paramilitary activity against it and its allies in Western Europe.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Bowyer Bell | first = J. | authorlink = J. Bowyer Bell | title = The Secret Army: The IRA | publisher = Transaction Publishers | year = 1997 | pages = 556–571 | doi =  | isbn = 1-56000-901-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first Libyan arms shipment to the IRA took place in 1972–1973, following visits by [[Joe Cahill]] to Libya. In early 1973, the Government of the Republic of Ireland received intelligence that the vessel ''Claudia'' was carrying a consignment of weapons, and placed the ship under surveillance on 27 March. On 28 March, three Irish Navy patrol vessels intercepted the ''Claudia'' in Irish territorial waters near Helvick Head, [[County Waterford]], seizing five tonnes of Libyan small arms and ammunition found on board. The weaponry seized included 250 Soviet-made small arms, 240 rifles, anti-tank mines and other explosives. Cahill himself was also found and arrested on board the vessel.&lt;ref&gt;[[RTÉ]] Documentary: The Navy&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Bowyer Bell, p. 398.&lt;/ref&gt;  It is estimated that three other shipments of weaponry of a similar size and nature succeeded in getting through to the IRA in the same time period.&lt;ref&gt;Taylor, p. 156&lt;/ref&gt; Journalist [[Ed Moloney]] reports that the early Libyan arms shipments provided the IRA with its first [[RPG-7]] rocket-propelled grenade launchers, and that Gaddafi also gave three to five million U.S. dollars at this time to the organisation to finance its activities.&lt;ref&gt;Moloney, p. 10.&lt;/ref&gt; However contact with the [[Libyan]] government was broken off in 1976.

Contact with Libya was opened again in the aftermath of the [[1981 Irish Hunger Strike]], which was said to have impressed Gadaffi. In the 1980s, the IRA received further larger quantities of weaponry and explosives from the Libyan Government, reportedly enough to equip least two professional infantry battalions.&lt;ref&gt;A court action is currently (May 2006) underway against Libya by victims of IRA violence. See [http://observer.guardian.co.uk/politics/story/0,,1759494,00.html here].&lt;/ref&gt; Four shipments of guns, ammunition and explosives were made between 1985 and 1986, providing large quantities of modern weaponry to the IRA, including heavy machine guns, over 1,000 rifles, several hundred handguns, [[rocket-propelled grenade]]s, [[flamethrowers]], [[surface-to-air missile]]s, and [[Semtex]] explosive.&lt;ref&gt;Harnden, Toby (1999). Bandit Country – The IRA and South Armagh. Hodder &amp; Stoughton. pp. 239–245&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Tony Geraghty, The Irish War. {{ISBN|0-8018-6456-9}}, p. 182&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Brendan O'Brien, The Long War – The IRA and Sinn Féin. {{ISBN|0-8156-0319-3}}, p. 137&lt;/ref&gt; – an odourless explosive, invisible to X-ray, and many times more powerful than fertiliser.&lt;ref name=Harnden/&gt; From late 1986 to 2011, virtually every bomb constructed by the Provisional IRA, and splinter groups such as the [[Real IRA]], contained Semtex from a Libyan shipment unloaded at an Irish pier in 1986.&lt;ref name=Harnden&gt;{{cite news|last=Toby|first=Harnden|title=Libyan arms helped the IRA to wage war|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/northernireland/8425593/Libyan-arms-helped-the-IRA-to-wage-war.html|accessdate=19 August 2013|newspaper=Telegraph (London)|date=4 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

These shipments were in retaliation for the British Government's support for the [[USAF|US Air Force's]] (USAF) [[Operation El Dorado Canyon|bombing attacks on Tripoli and Benghazi in 1986]], which in turn were in retaliation for the [[1986 Berlin discotheque bombing|1986 bombing]] of the LaBelle discotheque in Berlin. The USAF planes involved in the bombings had taken off from British bases on 14 April 1986, and Libya reportedly suffered 60 casualties in the attack. This second major Libyan contribution to the IRA came in 1986–1987.

There were four shipments which were not intercepted, in a huge intelligence failure of both Irish and British agencies described as 'calamitous' by journalist [[Brendan O'Brien (journalist)|Brendan O'Brien]].&lt;ref name=Malta&gt;O'Brien, p. 137&lt;/ref&gt; The arm supplies from Libya developed as follows:
* The trawler ''Casamara'' took on ten tonnes of weapons in September 1985 off the Maltese island of [[Gozo]]. These weapons were landed off the Clogga Strand near [[Arklow]] by [[inflatable boats]] some weeks later. The shipment contained five hundred crates of AK-47s, pistols, hand grenades, ammunition and seven RPG-7s.
* ''Casamara'' (renamed ''Kula'' at this time), left Maltese waters on 6 October 1985 carrying a cache of [[DShK]] heavy machine guns.
* In July 1986, there was a shipment of 14 tonnes, including, according to the authorities, two SAM-7s.
* In October 1986, another shipment of 80 tonnes which included one tonne of Semtex, reportedly ten SAM-7 missiles, more RPG-7s, AK-47s and hundreds of thousands of rounds of ammunition arrived aboard the oil-rig replenishment ''Villa''.&lt;ref&gt;Bowyer Bell, p. 570.&lt;/ref&gt;

In total, the arms shipments included: [[File:AK47.jpg|275px|thumb|right|An AK-47 assault rifle (over 1000 of which were donated by 
Gaddafi to the IRA in the 1980s)]]
[[File:Rpg-7.jpg|thumb|right|275px|RPG-7]]
* 9mm Browning, [[Taurus (manufacturer)|Taurus]], [[Glock]] and [[Beretta]] handguns
* [[AK-47|AK-47 Kalashnikov]] and [[AKM]] assault rifles
* [[Heckler &amp; Koch MP5|MP5]] submachine guns
* [[RPG-7]] anti-tank rocket launcher
* Soviet made [[DShK]] [[heavy machine guns]]
* [[FN MAG]] machine guns
* Military [[flamethrowers]]
* [[Semtex]] plastic explosive
* [[Strela 2]] man portable SAMs

It is also estimated that the Libyan government gave the IRA the equivalent of £2 million along with the 1980s shipments.&lt;ref name="op143"/&gt;

However, on 1 November 1987, during transit to Ireland, one-third of the total Libyan arms consignment being carried aboard the MV ''Eksund'' was intercepted by the [[French Navy]] while the ship was in the [[Bay of Biscay]],&lt;ref&gt;p.441, The dirty war: covert strategies and tactics used in political conflicts. Dillon, Martin&lt;/ref&gt; along with five crew members, among them [[Gabriel Cleary]]. The vessel was found to contain 120 tonnes of weapons, including HMGs, 36 RPGs, 1000 detonators, 20 SAMs, Semtex and 1,000,000 rounds of ammunition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = O'Brien | first = Brendan | authorlink = Brendan O'Brien (Irish journalist) | title = The Long War: The IRA and Sinn Féin | publisher = O'Brien Press | year = 1999 | doi = | isbn = 0-86278-606-1 | page = 142}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ed Moloney claimed that the ''Eksund'' shipment also contained military mortars and a 106-millimetre [[cannon]], an assertion never confirmed by the Irish authorities.&lt;ref&gt;Moloney, p. 22.&lt;/ref&gt; Despite the ''Eksund'' fiasco, the IRA was by then equipped with a quantity and quality of weaponry and explosives never available to them at any other phase of their history.&lt;ref name=Malta/&gt; Furthermore, according to Brendan O'Brien there was actually an 'over-supply', especially regarding the 600 AK-47s still in the hands of the IRA by 1992.&lt;ref&gt;O'Brien, p. 239&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Garda Síochána]] (the Police Service of the Republic of Ireland) uncovered numerous arms destined for the IRA in 1988. These included several hundred AK-47s, Russian DSHK HMGs, FN MAG machine guns and Semtex.&lt;ref name="op143"&gt;O'Brien, p. 143.&lt;/ref&gt;

By 1996, ''[[Jane's Intelligence Review]]'' reported that "it is believed that the bulk of the material presently in IRA arsenals was shipped from Libya in the mid-1980s with the aid of a skipper, Adrian Hopkins, hired for the purpose by the IRA."&lt;ref name=boyne&gt;{{cite web|last=Boyne|first=Sean|title=uncovering the Irish Republican Army|url=https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/pages/frontline/shows/ira/inside/weapons.html|work=1996 August 1|publisher=Frontline PBS.org, reprinted from Jane's Intelligence Review|accessdate=19 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Compensation claims===

On 31 October 2009, a cross-party delegation of Northern Irish politicians travelled to the Libyan capital Tripoli for the first face to face meeting with Libyan government ministers to discuss compensation claims for victims of IRA violence.&lt;ref name=AFP31Oct09Talks&gt;{{cite web

[[File:Sa 58-JH01.jpg|thumb|right|275px|Vz. 58]]
As well as these major sources of arms, the IRA also bought weapons on a smaller scale from various arms dealers in continental Europe. In the 1970s, some guns were purchased by [[Dáithí Ó Conaill]] in [[Czechoslovakia]] and in the 1980s, Belgian [[FN FNC]] rifles were obtained, probably smuggled through the [[Netherlands]]. 
There was contact between the IRA and the [[Palestine Liberation Organization]] (PLO) and specifically the [[Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine]]  (PFLP), starting from the mid-1970s which included the training of IRA volunteers.&lt;ref&gt;The IRA – 6th Edition – [[Tim Pat Coogan]] – p. 436&lt;/ref&gt; At one stage, the PLO offered weapons and training to the IRA, but they declined on the grounds that it was impossible to smuggle arms out of the [[Levant|Levant region]] and [[Palestine (region)|Palestine]] in specific without alerting Israeli intelligence. [[Tim Pat Coogan]] wrote that assistance from the PLO largely dried up in the mid-1980s after the PLO had forged stronger links with the government of the [[Republic of Ireland]].&lt;ref&gt;The IRA – 6th Edition – [[Tim Pat Coogan]] – p. 489&lt;/ref&gt; [[AG-3]] rifles from [[Norway]] were also secretly obtained.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Uncovering the Irish Republican Army | author = Sean Boyne | url = https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/pages/frontline/shows/ira/inside/weapons.html | publisher = ''Jane's Intelligence Review'' | date = 1 August 1996 | accessdate = 26 March 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Last arms deals==
In the 1990s, the [[Provisional IRA South Armagh Brigade]] smuggled in a number of [[M82 Barrett rifle|Barrett M82]] and [[Barrett M90]] [[.50 BMG]] rifles from the United States.&lt;ref&gt;O'Brien, pp. 354–355.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Harnden | first = Toby | authorlink = Toby Harnden | title = Bandit Country | publisher = [[Hodder &amp; Stoughton]] | year = 1999 | month = | isbn = 0-340-71736-X | page = 372}}&lt;/ref&gt; These weapons were used by two South Armagh sniper teams to conduct a [[South Armagh Sniper (1990-1997)|sniping campaign]] against British Army patrols operating in the area.  The last British soldier killed in Northern Ireland during [[The Troubles]], Stephen Restorick, was shot dead with a Barrett rifle in 1997.  Soon after, the leader of one of the Armagh sniper squads, Michael Caraher, was arrested and a Barrett rifle recovered.

Despite their ceasefires of 1994 and 1997 the IRA continued to buy arms.  They needed a new source of weapons, since the [[Libyan]] pipeline had been closed.  In May 1996, the [[Federal Security Service]] (FSB), Russia's internal security service, publicly accused Estonia of arms smuggling, and claimed that the IRA had contacted representatives of Estonia's volunteer defence force, [[Kaitseliit]], and some non-government groups to buy weapons.  However he did not say when the contacts had taken place.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Russia Reform Monitor No. 137 |author=J.

==Decommissioning of arms==
Following the announcement of their cessation of violence and commitment to exclusively peaceful means, the Provisional IRA decommissioned its arms in July–September 2005.  Among the weaponry estimated, (by [[Jane's Information Group]]), to have been destroyed as part of this process were:
* 1,000 rifles
* 2 tonnes of Semtex
* 20–30 heavy machine guns
* 7 surface-to-air missiles
* 7 flame throwers
* 1,200 detonators
* 11 rocket-propelled grenade launchers
* 90 hand guns
* 100+ grenades&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = IRA guns: The list of weapons | author = | url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/northern_ireland/4284048.stm | publisher = ''BBC'' | date = 26 September 2005 | accessdate = 26 March 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The panel overseeing the decommissioning of IRA weaponry and weapons stockpiles, the [[Independent International Commission on Decommissioning]] (IICD) headed by [[John de Chastelain|General de Chastelain]] oversaw the decommissioning process.  The decommissioning process has taken place using estimates of IRA weaponry submitted by the British and Irish Governments.&lt;ref&gt;Colonel Gaddafi is known to have given the British Government a detailed inventory of weapons he gave to the IRA in the 1970s and 1980s, this list was handed to British intelligence in 1995. See Bowyer Bell Page 578&lt;/ref&gt; General de Chastelain said he had seen rifles, particularly AK-47s, machine guns, ground-to-air missiles, explosives, explosive material, mortars, flame throwers, hand guns, timer units and ballistic caps, and some weaponry that was "very old", including a [[Bren light machine gun|Bren machine gun]].

The IICD's final report was issued on 26 September 2005 and the panel stated to the press:&lt;ref&gt;The IICD PDF report is available [http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/shared/bsp/hi/pdfs/26_09_05_decommissioning.pdf here].&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;We have observed and verified events to put beyond use very large quantities of arms which we believe include all the arms in the IRA's possession… Our new inventory is consistent with these estimates. We are satisfied that the arms decommissioning represents the totality of the IRA's arsenal.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

and while they could not report on the quantity or types of weapons destroyed they said:

&lt;blockquote&gt;The experience of seeing this with our own eyes, on a minute-to-minute basis, provided us with evidence so clear and of its nature so incontrovertible that at the end of the process [IRA weapon decommissioning] it demonstrated to us – and would have demonstrated to anyone who might have been with us – that beyond any shadow of doubt, the arms of the IRA have now been decommissioned.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Irish [[Taoiseach]] (Prime Minister) [[Bertie Ahern]] also stated at the time:

&lt;blockquote&gt;The weapons of the IRA are gone, and are gone in a manner which has been verified and witnessed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = IRA 'has destroyed all its arms' | author = | url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/northern_ireland/4283444.stm | publisher = ''BBC'' | date = 26 September 2005 | accessdate = 26 March 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

However, despite the conclusion of the IICD agreeing with the figures provided by the British security forces, unnamed sources in [[MI5]] and the [[Police Service of Northern Ireland|PSNI]] have reported to the press that not all IRA arms were destroyed during the process, a claim which so far remains unsubstantiated.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = House of Commons Hansard Debates for 8 Feb 2006 (pt 26) | author = | url = https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/cm060208/debtext/60208-26.htm | publisher = House of Commons | date = 8 February 2006 | accessdate = 18 March 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; These reports have since been scotched by the group overseeing the activities of paramilitaries in Northern Ireland – the [[Independent Monitoring Commission]] (IMC). In its latest report, dated April 2006, the IMC points out that it has no reason to disbelieve the IRA or information to suspect that the group has not fully decommissioned. Rather, it indicated that any weaponry that had not been handed in had been retained by individuals outside the IRA's control. Excerpt from the IMC's 10th report:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Indeed, our present assessment is that such of the arms as were reported to us as having been retained, would have been withheld under local control despite the instructions of the leadership. We note that, as reported by the Independent International Commission on Decommissioning (IICD), the leadership claimed only to have decommissioned all the arms "under its control".  The relevant points are that the amount of un-surrendered material was not significant in comparison to what was decommissioned and that these reports do not cast doubt on the declared intention of the IRA leadership to eschew terrorism and to follow the political path. We will continue to monitor the position.&lt;ref&gt;10th Report of the IMC Page 15 April 2006, available [http://www.independentmonitoringcommission.org/documents/uploads/ACFEF3.pdf here] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110726174400/http://www.independentmonitoringcommission.org/documents/uploads/ACFEF3.pdf |date=26 July 2011 }}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In 1964 Robb Engineering was acquired by the [[Dominion Bridge Company]].  Its assets were merged into Dominion's [[Canada Car and Foundry]] subsidiary.These corporate changes saw the workforce at Dominion Bridge Company's operations in Amherst undergo major changes following the dissolution of Robb Engineering.

Robb Engineering gained notoriety during the 1990s after being blamed as the maker of faulty [[open web steel joist]]s. Poor welds weakened the joists. In some cases the roof joists have experienced catastrophic failure, resulting in at least 1 roof collapse.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title = Roof cave-ins blamed on joists, Atlantic Canada | url= http://www.cbc.ca/news/story/2000/12/15/mall_collapse001215.html | accessdate = 2008-04-04 | work=CBC News | date=2000-12-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; With the collapse of 3 joists in 3 separate buildings confirmed, an inspection of all governmental structures was conducted in [[eastern Canada]] surveying how many of Robb Engineering's joists were being used.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = News Release from Government of Newfoundland and Labrador | url= http://www.releases.gov.nl.ca/releases/1997/wst/0310n02.htm | accessdate = 2008-04-04 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Inspections costing into the millions of dollars, found that several thousand government buildings, in several provinces across eastern Canada, were involved.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = News Release from Government of Newfoundland and Labrador| url= http://www.releases.gov.nl.ca/releases/1997/wst/0219n03.htm | accessdate = 2008-04-04 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Province to Conduct Remediation Program Over Christmas | url= http://www.gov.ns.ca/news/details.asp?id=20001221005 | accessdate = 2008-04-04 }}&lt;/ref&gt; An unknown number of private buildings could also be involved, however no statistical information was recorded reflecting this data.

'''Rolf Pingel''' (1 October 1913 – 4 April 2000) was a [[Luftwaffe]] [[fighter ace|ace]] and recipient of the [[Knight's Cross of the Iron Cross]] during [[World War II]].  The Knight's Cross of the Iron Cross was awarded to recognise extreme battlefield bravery or successful military leadership.

==Career==

Pingel was born 1 October 1913  in [[Kiel]], at the time in the [[Province of Schleswig-Holstein]], a [[Provinces of Prussia|province]] of the [[Kingdom of Prussia]]. Following completion of his flying training in 1937, Leutnant Pingel was posted to I./[[JG 134]]. He then served with the [[Condor Legion]] in the Spanish Civil War as a fighter pilot with 2./[[Jagdgruppe 88]]. He claimed six victories, in some 200 operations, and was awarded the [[Spanish Cross]] in Gold. Lt. Pingel was then transferred in as ''[[Staffelkapitän]]'', 2./JG 334 in October 1937. 2./JG 334 became 2./[[JG 53]] in March 1939.

[[File:Captured Me 109F-2 at Duxford 1941.jpg|thumb|left|Pingel's captured Bf 109F-2 (RAF serial ES906) at the [[Air Fighting Development Unit]], RAF Duxford, October 1941.]]
When the war broke out ''Oberleutnant'' Pingel claimed a French Air Force Mureaux 113 of GAO 1/506 near Saarlautern on 10 September 1939. On 30 September, he claimed a RAF [[Fairey Battle]] of No. 150 Squadron over the Saarbrücken-Merzig area, one of five claimed shot down by JG 53. On 11 June Pingel shot down two  Morane MS 406 fighters. In August 1940, during the [[Battle of Britain]] ''Hauptmann'' Pingel was posted as ''[[Gruppenkommandeur]]'' of I./[[JG 26]]. He was awarded the [[Knight's Cross of the Iron Cross]] on 14 September.

On 28 September, Pingel shot down a No. 249 Squadron [[Hawker Hurricane]] near Maidstone but his own aircraft was badly damaged, forcing Pingel to ditch off the English coast and be rescued by German air-sea rescue.

After 9 claims during the latter half of 1940, Pingel claimed his 20th air victory on 22 June 1941, a Spitfire near Dunkirk.

On 10 July 1941 Rolf Pingel was forced to land in England after being hit by return fire from a British [[Short Stirling]] bomber that he was pursuing. He descended to low altitude but was harried by several Spitfires, and he crashed landed near [[St Margaret's at Cliffe|St. Margarets Bay]] and was taken prisoner by a detachment of [[Home Guard (United Kingdom)|Home Guard]]. He was released in 1947.

Pingel's aircraft, [[Messerschmitt Bf 109|Bf 109 F–2]], Werk Nr. 12764, was returned to flying condition by the RAF and allocated the serial number ES906. It was briefly flown for evaluation testing until it crashed near [[Fowlmere]] on 20 October 1941, killing its Polish pilot F/O J. Skalski.

During his career Pingel was credited with 28 aerial victories, 6 in the Spanish Civil War and another 22 in World War II, in some 550 combat flights.

In [[epistemology]] (theory of knowledge), a '''self-evident proposition''' is a proposition that is known to be true by understanding its meaning without [[Logical argument|proof]],{{Citation needed|reason=Reliable source needed for the whole sentence|date=August 2014}} and/or by ordinary [[human reason]].

Some epistemologists deny that any proposition can be self-evident. For most others, one's belief that oneself is [[consciousness|conscious]] is offered as an example of self-evidence. However, one's belief that someone else is conscious is not epistemically self-evident.

The following proposition is often said to be self-evident:
* ''A finite whole is greater than, or equal to, any of its parts

Also self evident is the statement that two plus two is equal to four.

A [[logical argument]] for a self-evident conclusion would demonstrate only an ignorance of the purpose of persuasively arguing for the conclusion based on one or more premises that differ from it (see ''[[ignoratio elenchi]]'' and [[begging the question]]).

==Analytic propositions==
It is sometimes said that a self-evident proposition is one whose denial is self-contradictory. It is also sometimes said that an [[analytic–synthetic distinction|analytic proposition]] is one whose denial is self-contradictory. But the concepts mean different things.{{elucidate|date=October 2015}}

Provided that one understands and believes a self-evident proposition, self-evident propositions are not in need of proof. Likewise, that their denial is self-contradictory does not have to be proven. It is in this sense that the self-contradictions at work in self-evident and analytic propositions are different.

Not all analytic propositions are self-evident, and it is sometimes claimed that not all self-evident propositions are analytic: e.g. my knowledge that I am conscious.

==Other uses==
Claims of ''self-evidence'' also exist outside of epistemology.

===Informal speech===
In informal speech, ''self-evident'' often merely means ''obvious'', but the epistemological definition is more strict.

===Moral propositions===
Moral propositions may also be regarded as self-evident. For example, [[Alexander Hamilton]] cited the following moral propositions as self-evident in the [[Federalist No. 37]]:
* ''The means ought to be proportioned to the end.''
* ''Every power ought to be commensurate with its object.''
* ''There ought to be no limitation of a power destined to effect a purpose which is itself incapable of limitation.''

A famous claim of the self-evidence of a moral truth is in the [[United States Declaration of Independence]], which states, "We hold these Truths to be ''self-evident'', that all men are created equal, that they are endowed by their [[Creator deity|Creator]] with certain [[Inalienable rights|unalienable Rights]], that among these are [[Life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness|Life, Liberty and the pursuit of Happiness]]."; philosophically, these propositions' self-evidence is debatable.

Another classic example in epistemology are the claims by the Vedas (Vedanta) to be self-evident.

The '''Shaftesbury Theatre''' was a [[theatre]] in [[central London]], [[England]], between 1888 and 1941. It was built by John Lancaster for his wife, Ellen Wallis, a well-known [[Shakespeare]]an actress. The theatre was designed by [[Charles J. Phipps|C. J. Phipps]] and built by Messrs. Patman and Fotheringham at a cost of £20,000 and opened with a production of ''[[As You Like It]]'' on 20 October 1888.

The theatre had a stage of 28' 6" square. The capacity was 1,196.&lt;ref&gt;But see {{citation | url=http://www.british-history.ac.uk/report.aspx?compid=41110#s11 | title=Shaftesbury Avenue and Charing Cross Road | journal=Survey of London: volumes 33 and 34 | publisher=St Anne Soho | year=1966 | pages=296–312 |accessdate=2 August 2010}} which asserts that it was much larger.&lt;/ref&gt; It was located on the south side of [[Shaftesbury Avenue]], just east of Gerrard Place.

==History==
The theatre's first big hit was ''[[The Belle of New York (musical)|The Belle of New York]]'' produced by the prominent Broadway producer, George W. Lederer, which opened on 12 April 1898 and ran for an extremely successful 697 performances. In 1908–09 [[H. B. Irving]] became the lessee and manager of the theatre and presented a successful season of plays. [[Robert Courtneidge]] was lessee for most of the early years of the 20th century and produced mostly [[comic opera]]s and [[Edwardian musical comedies]], including ''[[Tom Jones (Edward German)|Tom Jones]]'' (1907), the record-setting hit ''[[The Arcadians (musical)|The Arcadians]]'' (1909), ''Oh! Oh! Delphine!'' (1913), ''The Pearl Girl'' and many others. In 1914 [[Basil Rathbone]] appeared at the Shaftesbury as the Dauphin in Shakespeare's ''[[Henry V (play)|Henry V]]''.

Courtneidge's successors, from 1917 to 1921 were [[George Grossmith, Jr.]] and [[Edward Laurillard]]. The produced a number of shows, including ''Arlette'' by Claude M. Ronald and L. Bouvet (1917); ''Baby Bunting'' by [[Fred Thompson]] and Worton David (1919); ''The Great Lover'', by Leo Ditrichstein, Frederic Hatton and Fanny Hatton (1920); and ''Out to Win'', by Roland Pertwee and Dion Clayton Calthrop (1921).&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | url=http://www.british-history.ac.uk/report.aspx?compid=41110#s11 | title=Shaftesbury Avenue and Charing Cross Road | journal=Survey of London: volumes 33 and 34 | publisher=St Anne Soho | year=1966 | pages=296–312 |accessdate=2 August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1941 the theatre was so severely damaged by [[strategic bombing|aerial bombardment]] that the lease was vacated, and in 1956 the site was appropriated by the [[London County Council]] for use as a fire station. It is at present used as a car park and for advertising purposes.

[[File:St Georges Langham Place.jpg|thumb|right|250px|From ''[[Illustrated London News]]'', 29 June 1867]]
'''St. George's Hall''' was a theatre located in [[Langham Place, London|Langham Place]], off [[Regent Street]] in the [[West End of London]]. It was built in 1867 and closed in 1966.  The hall could accommodate between 800 and 900 persons,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | author = Dickens, Charles, Jr. | year =1879| title = Public Halls, St. George's Hall | work = [[Dickens's Dictionary of London]]| url = http://www.victorianlondon.org/dickens/dickens-que.htm| accessdate = 2007-08-22| authorlink = Charles Dickens, Jr.}}&lt;/ref&gt; or up to 1,500 persons including the galleries. The architect was John Taylor of Whitehall.&lt;ref name=Lloyd&gt;[http://www.arthurlloyd.co.uk/StGeorgesHallLanghamPlaceLondon.htm History of the Hall from the Arthur Lloyd website]&lt;/ref&gt;

The hall was known for three decades for its presentation of the [[German Reed Entertainments]] alongside other musical works and lectures.  After 1895, it was used for [[vaudeville]], drama, magic shows, as the headquarters of the [[London Academy of Music and Dramatic Art|London Academy of Music]], and even as a skating rink.  In 1933, it became a [[British Broadcasting Corporation|BBC]] broadcasting studio but was shut down after extensive damage [[London Blitz|from bombing in March 1943]].  The theatre was demolished in 1966, and the St Georges Hotel and [[Henry Wood]] House now stand on the site.

==German Reed Entertainments and lectures==
The hall was built as a concert hall for the New Philharmonic Society and opened on 24 April 1867. The Hall could be used as a theatre, however, and the first production at "St. George's Theatre" was ''A Woman's Whim'' by Walter Stephens on 3 December 1867.&lt;ref name=Lloyd/&gt;

[[File:EyesandNo.jpg|left|frame|[[W. S. Gilbert]]'s last [[German Reed Entertainment]], 1875.]]Soon afterwards, the theatre was leased by [[Thomas German Reed]], who initially produced and conducted ''[[The Contrabandista]]'' (a [[comic opera]] by [[Arthur Sullivan]] and [[F. C. Burnand]]), ''[[The Beggar's Opera]]'' and other English operas in small-scale productions. In 1874, Reed's wife, [[Priscilla Horton|Priscilla German Reed]], moved the [[German Reed Entertainment]]s to St. George's Hall.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite DNB|wstitle=Reed, Thomas German Reed|volume=47|page=395}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Like their earlier theatre, the [[Gallery of Illustration]], St. George's had a small stage, and musical works were presented with only piano and harmonium.  Thomas retired in 1871, and his son Alfred continued to run the theatre with his mother until her retirement in 1879 and, beginning in 1877, in partnership with [[Richard Corney Grain]], until both their deaths in 1895.

The pieces premiered there included [[W. S. Gilbert]]'s farce, ''A Medical Man'' (1872) and his one-act [[comic opera]], ''[[Eyes and No Eyes]]'' (1875). [[John Baldwin Buckstone]] wrote ''Married Life'', and [[John Maddison Morton]] wrote ''Slasher and Crasher'' for the hall, both in 1872.&lt;ref&gt;[http://library.kent.ac.uk/library/special/icons/playbills/londonstgeorgeshall.htm Comtempory playbill (13 May 1872)] accessed 16 Apr 2007&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to performances, there were regular lectures in the hall, the [[Chartism|Chartist]] [[Gerald Massey]] gave a series of lectures in 1872, on ''Christianity and Spiritualism''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://domain1041943.sites.fasthosts.com/massey/cnr_langham_place_index.htm The Langham Place lectures 1872 – Gerald Massey] accessed 16 Apr 2007&lt;/ref&gt; The theist [[Charles Voysey (theist)|Charles Voysey]] gave regular Sunday sermons from 1875, after his ejection from the established church. [[H. G. Wells]] described a visit to one tedious Sunday lecture in ''Incidental Thoughts on a Bald Head''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.online-literature.com/wellshg/certain-personal-matters/22/ Incidental Thoughts on a Bald Head] accessed 16 Apr 2007&lt;/ref&gt;  When they were not presenting a piece at the hall, it was rented it out to amateurs or other entertainments.&lt;ref name=Lloyd/&gt;

[[File:William Poel's Hamlet court scene 1881.jpg|thumb|right|300px|The court scene from [[William Poel]]'s production of ''[[Hamlet]]'' in 1881]][[File:Corney Grain and Alfred Reed.png|[[Richard Corney Grain]] and Alfred Reed, from the 1896 Entr'acte Annual|thumb|220px]]
At the hall [[Gilbert Arthur à Beckett]] presented ''Two Foster Brothers'', composed by [[Alfred Cellier]] (1877), and ''Once in a Century'', with music by Vivian Bligh.  [[Henry Pottinger Stephens]] wrote his first [[Victorian burlesque|burlesque]], ''Back from India'' for the hall in 1879, as well as ''Hobbies'' in 1885, with [[William Yardley (cricketer)|William Yardley]] and music by George Gear.  ''Cherry Tree Farm'' and ''All at Sea'' played in 1881.&lt;ref name=Lloyd/&gt;  The same year, [[William Poel]] produced his ''[[Hamlet]]''.  In the early 1880s, [[Eric Lewis (actor)|Eric Lewis]] sometimes substituted at the Hall for Corney Grain.&lt;ref name=Timesobit&gt;"Death Of Mr. Eric Lewis", ''The Times'', 2 April 1935, p. 12&lt;/ref&gt;  Herbert Gardiner wrote ''A Night in Wales'' (1885) for the hall with music by Corney Grain.  [[Alfred J. Caldicott]] wrote a number of pieces for the hall, including ''A Treasure Trove'', ''A Moss Rose Rent'' (1883), ''Old Knockles'' (1884), ''In Cupid's Court'' (1885), ''The Friar'' (1886), ''Tally Ho'' (1887), ''Wanted, An Heir and The Boson's Mate'' (1888), ''John Smith'' (1889), ''The Old Bureau'' (1891), and ''An Old Pair'' (1893).&lt;ref&gt;Scowcroft, Phil. [http://www.musicweb-international.com/garlands/46.htm A Forty-sixth Garland of British Light Music Composers"], MusicWeb-International.com, accessed 7 February 2016&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Fanny Holland]] starred in many of the entertainments, along with Mr. and Mrs. German Reed, their son Alfred, Holland's husband [[Arthur Law (playwright)|Arthur Law]], Corney Grain, [[Arthur Cecil]] (all of whom also wrote for the hall) Carlotta Carrington and [[Leonora Braham]], who made her professional stage debut in 1870 at the hall in a revival of [[W. S. Gilbert|Gilbert]] and [[Frederic Clay|Clay]]'s ''[[Ages Ago]]'', which was revived again there in 1874.&lt;ref name=Lloyd/&gt;  Except for a brief stint at the [[Criterion Theatre]] in 1874 and at the [[Savoy Theatre]] in 1879-80, Holland starred at St. George's until 1895 in entertainments too numerous to name.  Many of the entertainments were written by Law, including ''A Night Surprise'' (1877), ''Nobody's Fault'', composed by Hamilton Clarke (1882), and ''A Happy Bungalow'', with music by [[Charles King Hall]].  Other pieces from the 1870s starring Holland included ''Number 204'' by [[F. C. Burnand]], with music by Thomas German Reed; and ''Our New Doll’s House'' by W. Wye, with music by Cotsford Dick.

==Later uses of the hall==
After the [[German Reed Entertainments]] closed in 1895, the building changed its name to the Matinee Theatre, on 17 April 1897, presenting "high class [[vaudeville]]," but it was not very successful.  A series of German plays were then produced, but in 1904 the hall closed.

In 1905, magician [[John Nevil Maskelyne]] renovated, expanded and reopened the 'St George's Hall, England's New Home of Mystery,' on 24 January 1905 with ''The Coming Race'' by [[David Christie Murray]] and Maskelyne.  Maskelyne's entertainments were called ''Maskelyne's Theatre of Mystery.''&lt;ref name=Lloyd/&gt;  The theatre also hosted meetings of [[The Magic Circle (organisation)|The Magic Circle]], an association of amateur and professional magicians, and its members [[David Devant]] and Maskelyne continued to give magic shows for many years.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.findmeaconference.com/520127.htm Information about The Magic Circle club's connection to the theatre] accessed 14 April 2007&lt;/ref&gt;  One was called ''Maskelyne and Devant's Mysteries'', which was presented in August 1910.&lt;ref name=Lloyd/&gt;

The hall was also used as a ''Bioscope Picture Palace'', although with a reduced capacity of 500.&lt;ref&gt;[http://londonfilm.bbk.ac.uk/view/venue/?id=821 Bioscope Annual Report 1910-11 p.87] accessed 16 April 2007&lt;/ref&gt;  The building also was used as the headquarters of the [[London Academy of Music and Dramatic Art|London Academy of Music]].  The hall was later converted to use as a skating rink.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.british-history.ac.uk/report.asp?compid=45207 Notes that the hall was later converted into a skating rink] accessed 14 April 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

St. George's was finally acquired by [[Eric Maschwitz]] for the [[British Broadcasting Corporation|BBC]] in 1933 for broadcasts of vaudeville, comedy and revue shows, and opened as a studio on 25 November 1933. The BBC installed the original ''BBC Theatre Organ'' in 1936, a ''Compton Melotone and Electrostatic Organ'', this enabled a wide range of sounds to be produced during performances.&lt;ref&gt;[http://uk.msnusers.com/ComptonMelotonesandElectrostaticOrgans/bbctheatreorgan.msnw BBC Theatre Organ, St George's Hall]&lt;/ref&gt; Reginald Foort was appointed resident organist. The hall sustained extensive damage from bombing in March 1943, during [[World War II]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://wiki.ibs.org.uk/audiocompendium/index.php?title=St._George's_Hall Institute of Broadcast Sound] accessed 16 April 2007&lt;/ref&gt; and the studios moved to the [[Aeolian Hall (London)|Aeolian Hall]], in New Bond Street.

The building was demolished in 1966, and together with the site of the adjacent [[Queens Hall]] – original home of the [[Henry Wood (conductor)|Henry Wood]] [[The Proms|promenade concert]]s – the location was used for the construction of the St Georges Hotel and Henry Wood House.

==Background==
{{see also|Breakup of Yugoslavia|Contributions to the Slovenian National Program|JBTZ trial|Slovenian Territorial Defence}}

Following the death of [[List of leaders of communist Yugoslavia|Yugoslav president]] [[Josip Broz Tito]] in 1980, underlying political, ethnic, religious, and economic tensions within Yugoslavia surfaced. In 1989 [[Slobodan Milošević]], Chairman of the Central Committee of the [[League of Communists of Serbia]] since 1986, became president of [[Socialist Republic of Serbia|Serbia]], the largest and most populous of the six Yugoslav republics. As Milošević moved to consolidate power by centralizing the state, the governments of the other republics sought to loosen the central grip on power by devolving as much constitutional power as possible to each of the republics and autonomous provinces. A series of disagreements among delegates persisted until four of the six republics each made the decision to secede from Yugoslavia. Supported by Germany and the Vatican,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.pl/books?id=lgc-XDvNWzoC&amp;pg=PA127&amp;lpg=PA127&amp;dq=us+germany+support+slovenian+independence&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=I-DVkC4CBj&amp;sig=bAKbr08N3rGfXX9AgR-bOG43uRw&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0CDQQ6AEwBjgKahUKEwiT5Z_c7MPHAhXFWRQKHYMsBdU#v=onepage&amp;q=us%20germany%20support%20slovenian%20independence&amp;f=false |title=Bosnia and Beyond: The "quiet" Revolution that Wouldn't Go Quietly - Jeanne M. Haskin - Google Books |publisher=Books.google.pl |date= |accessdate=2016-04-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; Slovenia was among those republics aiming for independence.

The first action in defence of Slovenian independence, that united both the opposition and democratized communist establishment in Slovenia was, however, carried out by the Slovene police forces, in an action named [[Action North]] in 1989. In April 1990, Slovenia held its first democratic multi-party elections, won by the [[DEMOS coalition]].

===Preparations for war===
On 23 December 1990, Slovenia held a [[Slovenian independence referendum, 1990|referendum]], which passed with 88.5% of overall electorate supporting independence (94.8% of votes cast), with a turnout of 93.3%.&lt;ref name="Juberias"&gt;{{cite book |url=http://crnvo.me/docs/biblio_eng/p10.pdf |title=Legal Aspects for Referendum in Montenegro in the Context of International Law and Practice |date=November 2005 |chapter=Some legal (and political) considerations about the legal framework for referendum in Montenegro, in the light of European experiences and standards |last=Flores Juberías |first=Carlos |page=74 |publisher=Foundation Open Society Institute, Representative Office Montenegro |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120426081759/http://crnvo.me/docs/biblio_eng/p10.pdf |archivedate=26 April 2012 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="STAT11"&gt;{{cite book | chapterurl=http://www.stat.si/letopis/2011/05_11/05-11-11.htm |title=Statistični letopis 2011 |trans-title=Statistical Yearbook 2011 |chapter=Volitve |trans-chapter=Elections |page=108 |publisher=Statistical Office of the Republic of Slovenia |work=Statistical Yearbook 2011 |year=2011 |volume=15 |ISSN=1318-5403}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Slovenian government was well aware that the federal government in [[Belgrade]] might seek to use military force to quash Slovenia's move towards independence. Immediately after the Slovenian elections, the [[Yugoslav People's Army]] (JNA) announced a new defence doctrine that would apply across the country. The Tito-era doctrine of "General People's Defence", in which each republic maintained a [[Territorial Defence Forces (Yugoslavia)|Territorial Defence Force]] (''Teritorialna obramba'', or TO), was to be replaced by a centrally directed system of defence. The republics would lose their role in defence matters, and their TOs would be disarmed and subordinated to JNA headquarters in Belgrade.

The Slovenian government resisted these moves and successfully ensured that the majority of [[Slovenian Territorial Defence]] (TO) equipment was kept out of the hands of the JNA. It also declared in a constitutional amendment passed on 28 September 1990 that its TO would be under the sole command of the Slovenian government. At the same time, the Slovenian government set up a secret alternative command structure, known as the Manoeuvre Structures of National Protection (''Manevrska struktura narodne zaščite'', or MSNZ). This was an existing but antiquated institution, unique to Slovenia, which was intended to enable the republic to form an ''ad hoc'' defence structure, akin to a [[militia|Home Guard]]. It was of negligible importance prior to 1990, with antiquated weapons and few members. However, the DEMOS-led government realised that the MSNZ could be adapted to provide a parallel organisation to the TO that would be entirely in the hands of the Slovenian government.[[File:Vaja slovenske teritorialne obrambe Premik 91.jpg|alt=photo of a Slovenian territorial defence member aiming his rifle, with military vehicles in the background|left|thumb|228x228px|Slovenian Territorial defence military drills held in March 1991]]When the JNA tried to take control of the Slovenian Territorial Defence, the TO's command structure was simply replaced by that of the parallel MSNZ. Between May and October 1990, some 21,000 Slovenian Territorial Defence and police personnel were secretly mobilised into the MSNZ command structure, of which the federal government was wholly unaware.{{Citation needed|date=June 2011}} The Slovenian government also undertook detailed planning of a military campaign against the JNA, which resulted in the production of an operational and tactical plan by November 1990 — over seven months before the conflict actually began.&lt;ref&gt;Gow, James &amp; Carmichael, Cathie. ''Slovenia and the Slovenes'', pp. 174–178. C. Hurst, London, 1999.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Slovenes were aware that they would not be able to deter the JNA forces for an extended period of time. Under Defence Minister [[Janez Janša]], they adopted a strategy based on an [[asymmetric warfare]] approach. TO units would carry out a [[guerrilla warfare|guerrilla]] campaign, using [[anti-tank weapons]] and [[anti-aircraft missiles]] to ambush JNA units. Tank columns could be trapped by destroying the lead and rear vehicles in favourable terrain — for instance, on a narrow mountain road where room for manoeuvre was limited &amp;ndash; enabling the rest to be tackled more easily. In preparation for this, the Slovenian government covertly bought lightweight missile systems from foreign suppliers, notably the [[SA-7 Grail]] (Strela) anti-aircraft missile and the German-designed [[Armbrust]] anti-tank system.{{citation needed|date=December 2017}} Hit-and-run and delaying tactics were to be preferred and frontal clashes were to be avoided since in such situations the JNA's superior firepower would have been very difficult to overcome.

==Conflict==
Slovenia and [[Croatia]] passed the acts about their independence on 25 June 1991. This "advance" on the date of independence was a critical element of the Slovenian plan to gain an early advantage in the expected conflict. The Slovenian government fully expected the Yugoslav military to respond with force on the day of the declaration of independence or shortly afterwards. By secretly advancing the date by 24 hours, the Slovenians wrongfooted the Yugoslav government, which had set 26 June as the date for its move.&lt;ref&gt;''Balkan Battlegrounds'', p. 58 (Central Intelligence Agency, 2002&lt;/ref&gt;

Although the Yugoslav army was adamantly opposed to Slovenian independence, it was divided about what to do. The YPA Chief of Staff, Colonel-General [[Blagoje Adžić]], advocated a large-scale military operation to remove the Slovenian government and bring "healthy forces" to power in the republic. His political superior, the Yugoslav Defence Minister General of the Army [[Veljko Kadijević]], insisted on a more cautious approach &amp;ndash; essentially a show of force that would convince the Slovenian government to back down on its declaration of independence. After some debate, Kadijević got his way.&lt;ref&gt;Allcock, John B. ''et al.'' ''Conflict in the Former Yugoslavia'', p. 274. ABC-CLIO, Denver, 1998&lt;/ref&gt;

It is unclear how much the civilian members of the Yugoslav government were involved in the decision to resort to force in Slovenia. [[Ante Marković]], the President of the Federal Executive Council (equivalent to Prime Minister) is reported to have said that the federal government had not been informed of the Army's actions.&lt;ref&gt;Mesić, Stjepan. "The Road to War", in ''The War in Croatia and Bosnia-Herzegovina, 1991–1995'', ed. Branka Magaš and Ivo Žanić. Frank Cass, London, 2001&lt;/ref&gt;

===26 June 1991===
On the morning of 26 June, units of the Yugoslav People's Army's 13th Corps left their barracks in [[Rijeka]], [[Croatia]], to move towards Slovenia's borders with [[Italy]]. The move immediately led to a strong reaction from local Slovenians, who organized spontaneous barricades and demonstrations against the JNA's actions. There had been no fighting yet, and both sides appeared to have an unofficial policy of not being the first to open fire.

By this time, the Slovenian government had already put into action its plan to seize control of the republic's border posts and the [[Ljubljana Airport|international airport at Brnik]]. The personnel manning the border posts were, in most cases, already Slovenians, so the Slovenian take-over mostly simply amounted to changing of uniforms and insignia, without any fighting. This was undertaken, in the words of Janez Janša, to "establish our sovereignty in the key triangle, border-customs-air control."&lt;ref&gt;Quoted in ''Balkan Battlegrounds'', ibid.&lt;/ref&gt; It also had important practical effects. The border crossings were a major source of revenue. In addition, by taking control of the borders, the Slovenians were able to establish defensive positions against an expected JNA attack. This meant that the YPA would have to fire the first shot. It was fired on 27 June at 14:30 in [[Divača]] by an officer of YPA.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.rtvslo.si/zabava/na-danasnji-dan/zgodilo-se-je-27-junija/167901 |title=Zgodilo se je ... 27. junija |language=Slovenian |trans-title=It Happened On ... 27 June |publisher=MMC RTV Slovenia |date=27 June 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===27 June 1991===
Further YPA troop movements took place in the early hours of 27 June. A unit of the YPA's 306th Anti-Aircraft Regiment, based in [[Karlovac]], Croatia, crossed the Slovenian border at [[Metlika]]. A few hours later, a column of tanks and armoured personnel carriers of the YPA 1st Armoured Brigade left their barracks at [[Vrhnika]] near the Slovenian capital [[Ljubljana]], heading for the [[Brnik Airport|airport at Brnik]]. They arrived a few hours later and took control of the facilities. As the YPA was the federal army, its forces were customarily deployed in various places within the federal republics including Slovenia. To the east, YPA units left [[Maribor]] heading for the nearby border crossing at [[Šentilj]] and the border town of [[Dravograd]] further west. The Yugoslav Air Force [[airborne leaflet propaganda|aircraft dropped leaflets]] over various parts of Slovenia bearing the messages "We invite you to peace and cooperation!" and "All resistance will be crushed."&lt;ref&gt;Quoted in ''Balkan Battlegrounds'', p. 59&lt;/ref&gt;

In the early hours of 27 June the Slovenian leadership was told of the movements of the YPA. The military leadership of the Fifth Military District, which included Slovenia, was in telephone contact with Slovenian president [[Milan Kučan]], telling him that the troops' mission was limited to taking over the border crossings and airport. A meeting of the Slovene presidency was hastily convened at which Kučan and the rest of the members decided on armed resistance.&lt;ref&gt;Silber, Laura &amp; Little, Allan. ''The Death of Yugoslavia''. Penguin, London, 1995&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Memorial to Toni Mrlak - Ljubljana Slovenia.JPG|thumb|upright|left|130px|Memorial to Slovenian helicopter pilot Toni Mrlak in Ljubljana]]
The Slovenian government had received warnings that the YPA would use helicopters to ferry [[special forces]] troops to strategic locations. It issued a warning to the YPA's 5th Military Command District in [[Zagreb]] that if helicopters continued to be used they would be shot down. The warning was disregarded by the YPA leadership, which still believed that the Slovenians would back down rather than fight. This was, however, a disastrous miscalculation. In the afternoon of 27 June, the Slovenian TO (Slovenian Territorial Defence) shot down two YPA helicopters&lt;ref&gt;Ramet, Sabrina (2005).

The [[Slovenian Territorial Defence]] also took up positions around YPA barracks in various locations, effectively besieging them, and launched a series of attacks on YPA forces across Slovenia. At Brnik, a Slovenian TO unit attacked the YPA troops holding the airport, and at [[Trzin]] a firefight developed in which four YPA soldiers and one Slovenian TO soldier ([[Edvard Peperko]]) were killed and the remainder of the YPA unit was forced to surrender. Attacks were also launched by Slovenian TO units on YPA tank columns at [[Pesnica pri Mariboru|Pesnica]], [[Ormož]] and [[Koseze, Ilirska Bistrica|Koseze near Ilirska Bistrica]]. A tank column from the YPA's 32nd Mechanised Brigade, advancing from [[Varaždin]] in Croatia, was blocked at Ormož near the Slovenian border and found itself unable to break through a Slovenian barricade.

Despite the confusion and fighting, the YPA nonetheless successfully accomplished much of its military mission. By midnight on 27 June it had captured all of the crossings along the Italian border, all but three crossings on the Austrian border and several of the new crossing points established along Slovenia's border with Croatia. However, many of its units were still stuck in vulnerable positions across Slovenia.

===28 June 1991===
During the night of 27–28 June, Slovenian TO units were ordered to undertake a general offensive against the YPA. The Slovenian defence ministry ordered:

&lt;blockquote&gt;At all locations where RS (Republic of Slovenia) armed forces ([[Slovenian Territorial Defence]]) have the tactical advantage, offensive actions against enemy units and facilities will be carried out. The enemy will be summoned to surrender, the shortest deadline possible for surrender given and action taken using all available weapons. While in action, any necessary arrangements will be made to evacuate and protect the civilians.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
Additional fighting took place throughout the day. The YPA tank column that had been attacked at Pesnica the previous day was blocked by impromptu barricades of Slovenian trucks at [[Štrihovec]], a few miles short of the border with [[Austria]], where it again came under attack by Slovenian TO personnel and Slovenian police. The [[SFR Yugoslav Air Force]] mounted two airstrikes in support of the YPA forces at Strihovec, killing four truck drivers. At [[Medvedjek, Trebnje|Medvedjek]] in central Slovenia, another YPA tank column came under attack at a truck barricade, where air raids killed six truck drivers. Heavy fighting broke out at [[Nova Gorica]] on the border with Italy, where the Slovenian Special Forces destroyed three YPA [[T-55]] tanks and captured an additional three. Four YPA soldiers were killed, among them the commander of the armored column, and nearly 100 more surrendered. Some sources claim that this was the decisive battle of the war.&lt;ref&gt;Schindler, John R. (2001). ''Isonzo: the forgotten sacrifice of the Great War''.

The border crossing at [[Holmec]] was captured by Slovenian TO forces. Two Slovenian and three YPA soldiers were killed, and 91 YPA soldiers captured. The YPA barracks at [[Bukovje Mansion]] in [[Bukovje, Dravograd|Bukovje near Dravograd]] were attacked by Slovenian TO units and a YPA weapons depot at [[Borovnica, Slovenia|Borovnica]] fell to the Slovenian TO, significantly improving the Slovenians' supply of weapons. The Yugoslav Air Force carried out attacks at a number of locations across the country, most notably at [[Brnik Airport]], where two journalists from Austria and Germany ([[Nikolas Vogel]] and Norbert Werner) were killed and four [[Adria Airways]] airliners were seriously damaged. The Yugoslav Air Force also attacked the Slovenian TO military headquarters at [[Kočevska Reka]] and flew sorties against radio and television transmitters at [[Krim (mountain)|Krim]], [[Kum (mountain)|Kum]], [[Sveta Gera|Trdina Peak]] and [[Nanos (plateau)|Nanos]] in an attempt to silence the Slovenian government broadcasts.

By the end of the day, the YPA still held many of its positions but was rapidly losing ground. YPA was beginning to experience problems with desertions — many Slovenian members of the YPA quit their units or simply changed sides - and both the troops on the ground and the leadership in Belgrade appeared to have little idea of what to do next.

===29 June 1991===
The outbreak of the war galvanised diplomatic efforts by the [[European Community]] to find an end to the crisis. Three EC foreign ministers met with Slovenian and Yugoslav government representatives in Zagreb during the night of 28–29 June and agreed on a ceasefire plan, but this was not put into practice. In the morning, the Slovenians achieved several significant military successes. The YPA troops at Ljubljana Airport near Brnik surrendered to Slovenian TO forces, who had surrounded the facility overnight. In the north, several YPA tanks were captured near Strihovec and later reorganised into a TO tank company. YPA special forces attempted a maritime landing at [[Hrvatini]] but were ambushed and repulsed by the Slovenians. The YPA-held border crossings at [[Šempeter-Vrtojba|Vrtojba]] and [[Šentilj]] also fell to the Slovenian TO, who seized the federal troops' weapons and tanks, providing a much-needed boost to their arsenal.

The YPA issued an ultimatum to Slovenia, demanding an immediate cessation of hostilities by 09:00 on 30 June. In response, the Slovenian Assembly adopted a resolution calling for a peaceful solution to the crisis that did not jeopardise Slovenian independence, and rejected the YPA ultimatum.

===30 June 1991===
Skirmishing continued in several places during the day. Slovenian forces seized the strategic [[Karawanken Tunnel (motorway)|Karawanken Tunnel]] under the [[Alps]] on the border with Austria and captured nine YPA tanks near [[Nova Gorica]]. The entire YPA garrison at Dravograd – 16 officers and 400 men, plus equipment – surrendered, and the garrisons at [[Tolmin]] and [[Bovec]] also fell to the Slovenians. The weapons captured from the garrisons were quickly re-issued to the Slovenian forces.

===1 July 1991===
More skirmishes took place, with Slovenian TO forces taking over a YPA facility at [[Nova Vas, Maribor|Nova vas]], south of Ljubljana. The YPA's ammunition dump at [[Črni Vrh, Idrija|Črni Vrh]] caught fire and was destroyed in a massive explosion, damaging much of the town. However, the Slovenians successfully captured depots at [[Pečovnik]], [[Bukovžlak]], and [[Zaloška Gorica]], taking possession of some 70 truckloads of ammunition and explosives.

The YPA 306th Light Air Defence Artillery Regiment's column retreated from its exposed position at Medvedjek and headed into the Krakovo Forest (''Krakovski gozd'') near the Croatian border. It ran into a blockade near the town of [[Krško]] and was surrounded by Slovenian forces, but refused to surrender, probably hoping for help from a relief column.{{Citation needed|date=October 2009}}

In the meantime, the YPA's leadership sought permission to change the tempo of its operations. Defence Minister [[Veljko Kadijević]] informed the Yugoslav cabinet that the YPA's first plan – a limited operation to secure Slovenia's border crossings – had failed, and that it was time to put into operation the backup plan of a full-scale invasion and imposition of military rule in Slovenia. However, the [[Presidency of Yugoslavia|collective presidency]] – headed at the time by Serbia's [[Borisav Jović]] – refused to authorise such an operation. The YPA Chief of Staff, General Blagoje Adzić, was furious and publicly denounced "the federal organs [which] continually hampered us, demanding negotiations while they [the Slovenians] were attacking us with all means."&lt;ref&gt;Quoted in ''Balkan Battlegrounds'', p. 64&lt;/ref&gt;

===2 July 1991===
The heaviest fighting of the war to date took place during 2 July. The [[Domžale radio transmitter]] was attacked at 10:37 UTC (11:37 local time) and heavily damaged by two YPA [[Mig-21]] planes. During the rest of the day there were a number of major set-backs for the YPA. The YPA convoy in the Krakovo Forest came under sustained attack from TO units, forcing it to surrender. Units from the YPA's Fourth Armoured Brigade attempted to move up from [[Jastrebarsko]] in Croatia but were beaten back near the border town of [[Bregana]]. The Slovenian TO mounted successful attacks on border crossings at [[Šentilj]], [[Gornja Radgona]], [[Fernetiči]] and [[Gorjansko]], overrunning them and taking a number of YPA troops prisoner. A protracted engagement between YPA and Slovenian TO forces took place during the afternoon and evening at Dravograd, and a number of YPA facilities around the country fell to Slovenian forces.

At 21:00, the Slovenian Presidency announced a unilateral ceasefire. However, this was rejected by the YPA leadership, which vowed to "take control" and crush Slovenian resistance.

===3 July 1991===
A large YPA armoured convoy set off from Belgrade on the morning of 3 July, ostensibly to go to Slovenia. It never arrived; according to the official account, this was due to mechanical breakdowns.

Fighting continued in Slovenia, with a YPA relief force heading for the [[Gornja Radgona]] border crossing being halted near [[Radenci]]. YPA forces at the [[Kog]] border crossing were also attacked by TO units. In the evening, the YPA agreed to a ceasefire and a withdrawal to barracks. In a separate incident not far from Radenci, in the village of [[Hrastje-Mota]], a Yugoslav [[Mil Mi-8|Mi-8]] helicopter developed mechanical problems and was forced to land. The helicopter was seized by the Slovene military, but was deemed not suitable for the newly born air force and handed back to Belgrade on 13 August.&lt;ref&gt;Insignia magazine, Volume 1, issue 2, March 1996&lt;/ref&gt;

===4–6 July 1991===
With a ceasefire now in force, the two sides disengaged. Slovenian forces took control of all of the country's border crossings, and YPA units were allowed to withdraw peacefully to barracks and to cross the border to Croatia.

===7 July 1991 and afterwards===
[[File:Umik JLA iz Slovenije (1).jpg|left|thumb|Slovene military member (front left) supervising YPA personnel before departure]]
The Ten-Day War was formally ended with the [[Brioni Accord]], signed on the Croatian [[Brijuni Islands]]. Slovenian and Croatian independence were agreed to. The terms were distinctly favourable to Slovenia; it was agreed that Slovenia and Croatia would postpone their independence for three months—which in practical terms had little real impact—and the Slovenian police and armed forces ([[Slovenian Territorial Defence]]) were recognised as sovereign on their territory.[[File:Odhod zadnjih vojakov JLA iz Kopra.jpg|alt=JNA personnel on ship|thumb|231x231px|Last JNA troops leaving Slovenian soil by sea]]It was agreed that all Yugoslav military units would leave Slovenia, with the Yugoslav government setting a deadline of the end of October to complete the process. The Slovenian government insisted that the withdrawal should proceed on its terms; the JNA was not allowed to take much of its heavy weaponry and equipment, which was later either deployed locally or sold to other Yugoslav republics. The withdrawal began about ten days later and was completed by 26 October.

==Casualties==
Due to the short duration and low intensity of the war, casualties were not high. According to Slovenian estimates, the YPA suffered 44 fatalities and 146 wounded, while the Slovenians had 18 killed and 182 wounded. Twelve foreign nationals were killed in the conflict, principally journalists and [[Bulgaria]]n truck drivers who had strayed into the line of fire. 4,692 YPA soldiers and 252 federal police officers were captured by the Slovenian side. According to post-war assessments made by the YPA, its material losses amounted to 31 tanks, 22 armoured personnel carriers, 6 helicopters, 6,787 infantry weapons, 87 artillery pieces and 124 air defence weapons damaged, destroyed or confiscated. Property damage was not heavy, due to the scattered and short-term nature of the fighting.{{Citation needed|date=December 2009}}

==Holmec incident==
The border station at Holmec was the location of an alleged war crime perpetrated by Slovenian TO forces, filmed by the Austrian public broadcasting station [[ORF (broadcaster)|ORF]]. Video footage shows a small group of YPA soldiers standing or walking slowly with raised hands, holding up a white sheet in an apparent attempt to surrender. Moments later, gunfire is heard and the soldiers fall or jump to the ground. Neither the origin of the gunfire nor its exact effect are clearly visible on the video segment. Slovene officials maintain that the YPA soldiers jumped for cover and were not hit, and that the matter was thoroughly investigated years ago. However, the incident sparked renewed public debate after the footage was shown on Serbian TV station [[B92]] in 2006, with many claiming that the soldiers were shot and killed by Slovenian TO troops and that Slovenia is trying to cover up the affair.&lt;ref&gt;[Serb Official Accuses Slovenia Troops Of War Crimes, 2006-04-08 Associated Press Report]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20070312052513/http://www.csees.net/?page=news&amp;news_id=51354 "Slovenia denies Serbian claims of independence war crimes", 2006-04-06 Slovenian News Agency STA Report]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;

The fate of the YPA soldiers identified on the footage is disputed. One report claims that the soldiers are still alive, 15 years after the conflict.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sta.si/vest.php?s=a&amp;id=1047273 "Belgrade Says Holmec Footage Victims Alive", 2006-04-26] Slovenian News Agency STA Report&lt;/ref&gt; Other reports identify three young soldiers as victims (Zoran Ješić, Goran Maletić and Antonio Šimunović) and claim that they were killed in the Holmec incident.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nacional.hr/en/clanak/24459/croat-victim-in-slovenian-war-crime "Croat victim in Slovenian war crime", 2006-04-10] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130617203913/http://www.nacional.hr/en/clanak/24459/croat-victim-in-slovenian-war-crime |date=17 June 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Strategic aspects of the war==
The actions of Slovenia's forces were largely dictated by the military strategy devised some months before and were tightly integrated with an equally detailed media management plan. An international media centre was established prior to the outbreak of conflict with [[Jelko Kacin]] designated to act as information minister and Slovenia's public face to the world. The Slovenian government and media successfully presented the conflict to Western European audiences as a case of a "David versus Goliath" struggle between an emerging democracy and an authoritarian communist state, and the columns of Yugoslav tanks brought to mind the events of the [[Tiananmen Square protests of 1989]] two years earlier. This won considerable international sympathy and favourable media coverage for the cause of independent Slovenia.

The Slovenians had the advantage of superior morale, compared to their adversaries in the Yugoslav army.{{Citation needed|date=December 2011}} Many of the Yugoslav soldiers did not realise they were taking part in a real military operation, rather than an exercise, until they came under attack.{{Citation needed|date=December 2011}} The officer corps was dominated by [[Serbia|Serbs]] and [[Montenegro|Montenegrins]] and in many cases ideologically committed to Yugoslav unity. The rank and file troops however were conscripts, many of whom had no strong motivation in fighting against Slovenes. Of the soldiers of the 5th Military District, which was in action in Slovenia, in 1990 30% were [[Albanians]], 20% [[Croats]], 15 to 20% [[Serbs]] and [[Montenegrins (ethnic group)|Montenegrins]], 10% [[Bosniaks]], and 8% [[Slovenes]].&lt;ref&gt;Meier, Viktor. ''Yugoslavia — A History of its Demise''. Routledge, London, 1999&lt;/ref&gt;

The Slovenians were also well aware that the Serbian government of Slobodan Milošević was not particularly concerned about Slovenia's independence,{{Citation needed|date=January 2012}} given the lack of any significant Serbian minority in the country. On 30 June, Defence Minister General Kadijević suggested to the Yugoslav federal presidency a massive attack on Slovenia to break down the unexpectedly heavy resistance. But the Serb representative, [[Borisav Jović]], shocked the military establishment by declaring that Serbia did not support further military action against Slovenia.&lt;ref&gt;Vasić, Miloš. "The Yugoslav Army and the Post-Yugoslav Armies", in ''Yugoslavia and After — A Study in Fragmentation, Despair and Rebirth'', ed. David A. Dyker &amp; Ivan Vejvoda. Longman, London, 1996&lt;/ref&gt; Serbia was at this point more concerned with the situation in Croatia; even before the war had ended, YPA troops were already repositioning themselves for the imminent [[Croatian War of Independence|war in Croatia]].{{Citation needed|date=January 2012}}

==Consequences of the war==
For Slovenia, the war marked the decisive defence of its independence in regard to Yugoslavia. It was officially recognised by all European Community member states on 15 January 1992 and joined the [[United Nations]] on 22 May.

With Croatia as a buffer between Slovenia and Serbia, Slovenia was able to maintain its independence and position as the most stable and prosperous of the former Yugoslav republics and joined the [[European Union]] on 1 May 2004.

The war led to a series of major shifts on the Yugoslav side. The YPA eventually lost nearly all of its Slovenian and Croat personnel, becoming an almost entirely Serbian and Montenegrin force. Its poor performance in Slovenia and later in Croatia discredited its leadership — Kadijević resigned as defence minister in January 1992, and Adžić was forced into medical retirement shortly afterwards.

The Slovenian and Croatian governments were urged by the [[European Commission]] to [[Brioni Agreement|freeze their declaration of independence]] for a period of three months, hoping to ease tension, to which Slovenia and Croatia agreed. Slovenia used the period to consolidate its institutions, deliver some of the most urgent economic reforms and prepare for international recognition of the country.

'''Dr. Thomas Neill Cream''' (27 May 1850 – 15 November 1892), also known as the '''Lambeth Poisoner''', was a [[Scottish people|Scottish]]-[[Canadians|Canadian]] [[serial killer]], who claimed his first proven victims in the United States and the rest in England, and possibly others in Canada and Scotland&lt;!-- as mentioned in Early Life below --&gt;. Cream, who poisoned his victims, was [[death penalty|executed]] after his attempts to frame others for his crimes brought him to the attention of London police.

Unsubstantiated rumours suggested his last words as he was being [[hanging|hanged]] were a confession that he was [[Jack the Ripper]]—even though he was supposed to be in prison at the time of the Ripper murders.

==Early life==
Born in [[Glasgow]], Cream was raised outside [[Quebec City]], after his family moved there in 1854. He attended [[McGill University]] in [[Montreal]] and graduated with an [[Doctor of Medicine#United States and Canada|MDCM degree]] in 1876 (his thesis topic was chloroform). He then went for post-graduate training at [[St Thomas's Hospital Medical School]] in London, and in 1878 obtained additional qualifications as a physician and surgeon in [[Edinburgh]]. He then returned to Canada to practise in [[London, Ontario]].

In 1876, Cream married Flora Brooks, whom he had impregnated and almost killed while [[abortion|aborting]] the baby.&lt;ref&gt;Shore (1955) p.15&lt;/ref&gt; Flora died, apparently of [[Tuberculosis|consumption]], in 1877, a death for which Cream would later be blamed.

In August 1879, Kate Gardener, a woman with whom he was alleged to have had an affair, was found dead in an alleyway behind Cream's office, pregnant and poisoned by [[chloroform]]. Cream claimed that she had been made pregnant by a prominent local businessman, but after being accused of both murder and blackmail, Cream fled to the United States.&lt;ref&gt;Shore (1955) p.16&lt;/ref&gt;

==Chicago==
Cream established a medical practice not far from the [[red-light district]] in Chicago, offering illegal [[abortion]]s to [[prostitutes]]. He was investigated in August 1880 after the death of Mary Anne Faulkner, a woman on whom he had allegedly operated, but he escaped prosecution due to lack of [[evidence]].&lt;ref&gt;McLaren (1995) pp.38–39 and note on p.156&lt;/ref&gt;

In December 1880 another patient, Miss Stack, died after treatment by Cream, and he subsequently attempted to [[blackmailing|blackmail]] a pharmacist who had filled the actual prescription.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.murderbygaslight.com/2010/08/lambeth-poisoner.html ''murderbygaslight.com'']&lt;/ref&gt;

In April 1881, a woman named Alice Montgomery died of [[strychnine]] poisoning following an abortion in a rooming house barely a block from Cream's office. The case was ruled a murder but never solved. The location, time period, and method make Cream a likely suspect.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|date=September 2015|title=did-dr-thomas-neill-cream-kill-alice|website=Mysterious Chicago Blog|url=http://www.mysteriouschicagoblog.com/2015/09/did-dr-thomas-neill-cream-kill-alice.html|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150919033519/http://www.mysteriouschicagoblog.com/2015/09/did-dr-thomas-neill-cream-kill-alice.html|archivedate=19 September 2015|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 14 July 1881, Daniel Stott died of strychnine poisoning at his home in [[Boone County, Illinois]], after Cream supplied him with an alleged remedy for [[epilepsy]]. The death was attributed to natural causes, but Cream wrote to the coroner blaming the pharmacist for the death after again attempting blackmail. Cream was arrested, along with Mrs. Julia A. (Abbey) Stott, who had become Cream's mistress and procured poison from Cream to do away with her husband. She turned [[state's evidence]] to avoid jail, laying the blame on Cream, which left him to face a [[murder]] conviction on his own. He was sentenced to [[life imprisonment]] in [[Joliet Prison]].&lt;ref&gt;Shore (1955) pp.17–18&lt;/ref&gt;

One night unknown persons erected a tombstone at Mr. Stott's grave which read, &lt;blockquote&gt;
Daniel Stott Died June 12, 1881 Aged 61 Years, poisoned by his wife and Dr. Cream.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/18266219 |title=D. Stott |website= Find a grave}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Cream was released in July 1891. Governor [[Joseph W. Fifer]] had commuted his sentence after Cream's brother pleaded for leniency and allegedly [[bribery|bribed]] the authorities.&lt;ref&gt;''Chilling Historical Crimes: Volume 1, Volume 1'' {{ISBN|0-425-21782-5}} Ch. 5&lt;/ref&gt;

==London==
Using money inherited from his father, who had died in 1887, Cream sailed for England, arriving in [[Liverpool]] on 1 October 1891. He returned to London and took lodgings at 103 [[Lambeth Palace Road]]. At the time, [[Lambeth]] was ridden with [[poverty]], petty crime, and [[prostitution]].

On 13 October 1891, Ellen "Nellie" Donworth, a 19-year-old prostitute, accepted a drink from Cream. She was severely ill the next day and died on 16 October from [[strychnine]] poisoning. During her inquest Cream wrote to the coroner offering to name the murderer in return for a £300,000 reward. He also wrote to [[Frederick Smith, 2nd Viscount Hambleden|W. F. D. Smith]], owner of the [[W H Smith]] bookstalls, accusing him of the murder and demanding money for his silence.&lt;ref&gt;Shore (1955) p.22&lt;/ref&gt;

On 20 October, Cream met with a 27-year-old prostitute named Matilda Clover. She became ill and died the next morning; her death was at first attributed to her [[alcoholism]]. Cream wrote a note to the prominent physician Dr. [[William Broadbent]] accusing him of poisoning Matilda Clover and demanding cash. Broadbent sent his letter to [[Scotland Yard]].&lt;ref name=wallace&gt;{{cite book|last=Edwards|first=Wallace|title=I am Jack The…|year=2013|publisher=Absolute Crime}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 2 April 1892, after a vacation in Canada, Cream was back in London where he attempted to poison Lou Harvey (née Louise Harris) who, being suspicious of him, pretended to swallow the pills he had given her.  She secretly disposed of them by throwing them off a bridge into the [[River Thames]].

On 11 April, Cream met two prostitutes, Alice Marsh, 21, and Emma Shrivell, 18, and talked his way into their flat where he offered them bottles of [[Guinness]]. Cream left before the strychnine he had added to the drinks took effect. Both women died in agony.

==Capture==
Through his accusatory letters, Cream succeeded in drawing significant attention to himself. Not only did the police quickly determine the innocence of those accused, but they realised there was something significant within the accusations made by the anonymous letter-writer: he had referred to the ''murder'' of Matilda Clover. In fact, Clover's death had been registered under natural causes, related to her drinking. The police quickly realised that the false accuser who had written the letter was the serial killer now referred to in the newspapers as the 'Lambeth Poisoner'.

Not long afterward, Cream met a policeman from [[New York City]] who was visiting London. The policeman had heard of the Lambeth Poisoner, and Cream gave him a brief tour of where the various victims had lived. The American happened to mention it to a British policeman who found Cream's detailed knowledge of the case suspicious.

The police at Scotland Yard put Cream under [[surveillance]] and soon discovered his habit of visiting prostitutes. They also contacted police in the United States and learned of their suspect's conviction for a murder by poison in 1881.

At the inquest held by [[Athelstan Braxton Hicks]] in July 1892 he read out a letter purporting to be from Jack the Ripper declaring Dr Neill innocent, which produced laughter including from Neill. The jury returned the verdict that Matilda Clover died from strychnine poisoning administered by Thomas Neill.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://find.galegroup.com/ttda/infomark.do?&amp;source=gale&amp;prodId=TTDA&amp;userGroupName=rtl_ttda&amp;tabID=T003&amp;docPage=article&amp;searchType=AdvancedSearchForm&amp;docId=CS202036974&amp;type=multipage&amp;contentSet=LTO&amp;version=1.0|title=The Lambeth Poisoning Case|last=|first=|date=14 July 1892|work=Times [London, England]|access-date=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|publisher=The Times Digital Archive|page=12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 3 June 1892, Cream was arrested for the murder of Matilda Clover, and on 13 July he was formally charged with the murders of Clover, Donworth, Marsh, and Shrivell, the attempted murder of Harvey, and extortion.&lt;ref name=wallace/&gt; From the start he insisted he was only Dr. Thomas Neill, not Dr. Thomas Neill Cream, and the newspapers usually referred to him as Dr. Neill in their coverage of the proceedings.

==Trial and execution==
His trial lasted from 17 to 21 October that year. After a deliberation lasting only 12 minutes, the jury found him guilty of all counts, and Justice [[Henry Hawkins, 1st Baron Brampton|Henry Hawkins]] sentenced him to death.&lt;ref name=wallace/&gt;

Less than a month after his conviction, on 15 November, Cream was [[hanged]] on the gallows at [[Newgate Prison]] by [[James Billington (executioner)|James Billington]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=A history of capital punishment: with special reference to capital punishment in Great Britain | first=John | last=Laurence | publisher=S. Low, Marston &amp; Co. | year=1932 | page=125 }}&lt;/ref&gt; As was customary with all executed criminals, his body was buried the same day in an [[unmarked grave]] within the prison walls.

==Aftermath==
His name does not appear in later McGill graduate directories.{{citation needed|date=August 2017}}

=="I am Jack The..."==
{{Further|Jack the Ripper suspects}}
Billington claimed that Cream's last words on the scaffold were "I am Jack The..."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| title=Ripper Notes: Suspects &amp; Witnesses | volume=23 | series=Ripper notes | first1=Dan | last1=Norder | first2=Wolf | last2=Vanderlinden | first3=Stewart P. | last3=Evans | publisher=Inklings Press | year=2005 | isbn=978-0-9759129-4-2 | page=58 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Billington promoted this alleged incident as proof that he was responsible for executing the notorious Victorian serial killer [[Jack the Ripper]].

These claims remain unsubstantiated, as police officials and others who attended the execution made no mention of any such event. Moreover, records show Cream was in prison at the time of the Ripper murders in 1888, so it would have been impossible for him to be the culprit. However, Donald Bell suggested that Cream could have bribed officials and left the prison before his official release,&lt;ref&gt;Bell, Donald (1974), "Jack the Ripper – The Final Solution?", ''The Criminologist'' vol. 9, no. 33, quoted in Evans and Skinner, ''Jack the Ripper: Letters from Hell'', p. 212 and Rumbelow, pp. 206–207&lt;/ref&gt; and Sir [[Edward Marshall-Hall]] suspected that his prison term may have been served by a look-alike in his place.&lt;ref&gt;[[Edward Marjoribanks (Conservative politician)|Marjoribanks, Edward]], ''The Life of Sir Edward Marshall Hall'', quoted in Rumbelow, p. 208&lt;/ref&gt; Such notions are unlikely and contradict evidence given by the Illinois authorities, newspapers of the time, Cream's solicitors, Cream's family, and Cream himself.&lt;ref&gt;Rumbelow, pp. 206–208&lt;/ref&gt;

One of Cream's biographers suggested that Cream, on the scaffold and about to be hanged, was so frightened that he lost control of his bodily functions and stammered "I am ejaculating", which could have been mistaken for "I am Jack".&lt;ref&gt;Jonathan Goodman with Bill Waddell (Curator):, The Black Museum: Scotland Yard's Chamber of Crime (London: Harrap, Ltd, 1987)&lt;/ref&gt;

English-Canadian writer [[Chris Scott (writer)|Chris Scott]] won an [[Arthur Ellis Awards|Arthur Ellis Award]] for Best Crime Novel in 1989 for ''Jack'', a novel based on the premise that Cream actually was Jack the Ripper.&lt;ref name=farmer&gt;{{cite news | title=Farmer in spring, award-winning writer in winter | newspaper=[[Ottawa Citizen]] | date=15 June 1989}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Analysis==
The motivation for the series of poisonings has never been settled. It has generally been assumed that Cream was a [[Sadistic personality disorder|sadist]] who enjoyed the thought of the agonies of his victims (even if he was not physically present to witness these). However, Cream was also interested in money, as evidenced by his attempts at extortion in almost all of his crimes, so it remains a possibility that he committed the murders under the pretense of ill-planned attempts to profit from them. From the start of the series of crimes Cream wrote [[blackmail]] notes to prominent people; and the poisoning of his one known male victim, Daniel Stott, was committed with the hope that Stott's wealthy widow would share the deceased's estate with Cream.

In addition to the five poisonings Cream was convicted for, he is suspected in the murder of his wife Flora Brooks in 1877, and at least four other women who died in his care while undergoing abortions.&lt;ref&gt;''Medical Murder: Disturbing Cases of Doctors Who Kill'' {{ISBN|978-0-857-65415-1}} p. 83&lt;/ref&gt;

==Representations in popular culture==
In the 2015 [[BBC One]] television series ''[[River (TV series)|River]]'', Cream appears frequently to and converses with D.I. John River as a "manifest".

In the first episode (in 2000) of "Murder Rooms: Mysteries of the Real Sherlock Holmes," the young Conan Doyle and Dr Bell pursue a murder case that involves a Thomas Neill, played by the actor Alec Newman. At the end, a postscript further identifies him as Dr. Thomas Neill Cream, who attended medical school alongside the real Arthur Conan Doyle.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1934">The '''Tipografia e Libreria Elvetica''' of [[Capolago]] was a nineteenth-century [[publishing house]] in [[Canton Ticino]], [[Switzerland]].  

==History==
It operated from 1830 to 1853 , and acquired a particular importance as a clandestine press of the patriots of the Italian [[Risorgimento]].

The Tipografia Elvetica was founded in 1830 by the Genoese exile Alessandro Repetti and directed by Gino Daelli. Thanks to its location on Swiss territory, close to the border with the Austrian-controlled [[Kingdom of Lombardy-Venetia]], it rapidly became an important point of reference for the publication of patriotic works circulated clandestinely in Italy.

===Collaborators and authors===
The press enjoyed the collaboration of the [[Giuseppe Mazzini|Giuseppe Mazzinian]] [[Luigi Dottesio]], who gave a notable impulse to the printing of books, periodicals and proclamations of Risorgimental patriots and exiles. 

The main authors published included [[Vincenzo Gioberti]], [[Francesco Domenico Guerrazzi]], [[Giuseppe La Farina]], [[Niccolò Tommaseo]], [[Jean Charles Leonard Simonde de Sismondi]], [[Pietro Colletta]], [[Cesare Balbo]] and [[Massimo d'Azeglio]].

In 1851 Luigi Dottesio was arrested and executed by the Austrians. The growing attentions of the Swiss authorities, under Austrian pressure, forced Repetti to close down the Tipografia Elvetica in 1853.

The '''Water Festival''' is the New Year's celebrations that take place in East Asian countries such as China and Taiwan, and Southeast Asian nations such as [[Cambodia]], [[Laos]], [[Myanmar]], and [[Thailand]]. It is called the &lt;nowiki&gt;'Water Festival'&lt;/nowiki&gt; by Westerners because they notice people splashing or pouring water at one another as part of the cleansing ritual to welcome the New Year. Traditionally people gently sprinkled water on one another as a sign of respect, but as the new year falls during the hottest month in South East Asia, many people end up dousing strangers and passersby in vehicles in boisterous celebration. The act of pouring water is also a show of blessings and good wishes. It is believed that on this Water Festival, everything old must be thrown away, or it will bring the owner bad luck.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Hsin-chun Tasaw Lu|title=Negotiating Ethnicity: Burmese Chinese Migrants in Taiwan|journal=Journal of Burma Studies|date=2008|volume=12|pages=29- 62| doi=10.1353/jbs.2008.0001| url=https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Tasaw_Lu/publication/236746812_Festivalizing_Thingyan_Negotiating_Ethnicity_Burmese_Chinese_Migrants_in_Taiwan/links/54b6c2e20cf2e68eb27f0528.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The annual Water Splashing Festival of the Dai ethnic minority falls during the New Year celebrations of the Dai Calendar. It is the most important festival observed by the Dai ethnic people of Xishuangbanna Prefecture, and, similar to its direct neighbor Laos' [[Lao New Year|Songkran]] festival, it involves three days of celebrations that include sincere, yet light-hearted religious rituals that invariably end in merrymaking, where everyone ends up getting splashed, sprayed or doused with water.

The festival lasts for three days. The first two days's activities are concentrated on the banks of the Lancang ([[Mekong]]) River. On the first day, a grand celebration marks the beginning of the festival.  An out-door market is set up, where locals go for new year shopping.  It is also a great place to purchase local souvenirs. Local food and snacks are other highlights traveler may not want to miss. Artists create sand carvings on open space close to the market.  A dragon boat race is held on the Lancang River to ring out the old year in the afternoon.  At night, the banks of the river are colorfully lit, and locals float river lanterns on the river. Floating river lanterns is an old tradition in China, which is still preserved in many cities today. The practice is thought to drive bad luck away and bring good luck.

The third day, the climax of the festival, is reserved for water splashing. On that day, the Dai put on their newest and best clothes, then assemble at the local Buddhist temple, where the monks chant Buddhist scriptures. Afterward, a symbolic water splashing ritual is enacted whereby a Buddhist statue, with pomp and ceremony, is first coaxed out of the temple to the courtyard, then is splashed with water. This important ritual is called 'Bathing the Buddha'.

The completion of the 'Bathing the Buddha' ritual serves as the signal that encourages ordinary mortals to themselves engage in mutual water splashing. Accordingly, people flock to the streets with pots, pans, bottles, or whatever, where they uninhibitedly splash, spray and douse each other with water, with the same gusto with which Westerners engage in a good snowball free-for-all.

The Water Splashing ceremony, however, is more than just good-natured fun; it also contains a religious element: water is regarded by the Dai as a symbol, firstly, of religious purity, but also of goodwill among people. Therefore, splashing a fellow human being with water during the Water Splashing Festival, whether a close neighbor or a fellow villager, or even a stranger, is an expression of the desire for good luck and prosperity to that person.

In [[Yunnan]] ([[China]]), the Water Splashing Festival is celebrated by the [[Dai people|Dai]] ethnic group which is one of the 55 ethnic minorities in [[China]]. The whole celebration usually starts on the 13th of April and takes 3–7 days. On the first day of the festival Dai people race [[dragon boats]] and light fireworks (made of bamboo) for good luck in the coming years. The second day, Dai people get together to dance, and pour water on others because they believe that pouring water on others can help remove bad luck and bring out happiness. Finally, on the last day of the festival, young generations will get together to exchange gifts and date their mates. The Water Splashing Festival is one of the most influential ethnic festivals in [[Yunnan]] area. It attracts thousands of tourists every year from all over China. The huge tourist industry contributes greatly to the development of the area.

The festival has many different names specific to each country, such as Songkran in Laos and Thailand, Chaul Chnam Khmer or Songkran in Cambodia, and Thingyan in Myanmar. The New Year is celebrated in other South Asian countries, based on the astrological event of the sun beginning its northward journey. Traditional dance, singing and cultural shows are performed together during the festival. Religious activities in the tradition of [[Theravada Buddhism]] are also carried out at both [[pagoda]] and [[monastery]]. Young people visit elders to pay respect during this period.

The Myanmar New Year ''[[Thingyan]]'' is announced by the [[traditional calendar of Myanmar]] Team and normally falls around 13 April. Cambodia celebrates the [[Cambodian New Year]] from 13 to 15 April (ចូលឆ្នាំខ្មែរ or សង្ក្រាន្ត). The [[Lao New Year]], called [[Lao New Year|Songkran]] (ສົງກຣານ) in the Lao language, is celebrated every year from 13 to 15 April. The Thai New Year (สงกรานต์ = [[Songkran (Thailand)|Songkran]] in Thai language) is fixed every year from 13 to 15 April.

"Water Festival" is often a confusing term for foreigners in Cambodia because the Khmer New Year in April is not normally referred to as "the Water Festival", unlike equivalent new year celebrations in neighboring countries. Rather, the "Water Festival" in Cambodia usually refers to the festival [[Bon Om Thook]] (Khmer:ពិធីបុណ្យអុំទូក) focused on traditional boat racing, which usually takes place in November each year.
