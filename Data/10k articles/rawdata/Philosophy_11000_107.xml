'''Adam Tanner''' (in [[Latin]], '''Tannerus''') (April 14, 1572 &amp;ndash; May 25, 1632) was an [[Austria]]n [[Jesuit]] theologian.

He was born in [[Innsbruck]], [[Austria]]. In 1589 he joined the [[Society of Jesus]] and became a teacher. By 1603 he was invited to join the [[Jesuit College of Ingolstadt]] and take the chair of [[theology]] at the [[University of Ingolstadt]]. Fifteen years later he was given a position at the [[University of Vienna]] by the [[Emperor Matthias]].

He was noted for his defense of the [[Catholic]] church and their practices against [[Lutheran]] reformers as well as the [[Utraquists]]. His greatest work was the ''Universa theologia scholastica'', published in 1626–1627.

He died at the village of [[Unken]] near [[Salzburg]], and rests in an unmarked grave. Apparently the parishioners refused to give him a [[Christian]] [[burial]] because a "hairy little [[imp]]" was found on a glass plate among his possessions.

The crater [[Tannerus (crater)|Tannerus]] on the [[Moon]] is named after him.

'''Advesha''' (Sanskrit; Pali: ''adosa''; Tibetan Wylie: ''zhes sdang med pa'') is a [[Buddhism|Buddhist]] term translated as "non-aggression"  or "non-hatred". It is defined as the absence of an aggressive attitude towards someone or something that causes pain.&lt;ref name=g1&gt;Guenther (1975), Kindle Locations 538-539.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=eric1&gt;Kunsang (2004), p. 25.&lt;/ref&gt;  It is one of the [[Mental factors (Buddhism)|mental factors]] within the [[Abhidharma]] teachings. 

The [[Abhidharma-samuccaya]] states: 

:What is advesha? It is the absence of the intention to harm sentient beings, to quarrel with frustrating situations, and to inflict suffering on those who are the cause of frustration. It functions as a basis for not getting involved with unwholesome behavior.&lt;ref name="g1"/&gt;

'''Albert Hofstadter''' (March 28, 1910&amp;nbsp;– January 26, 1989) was an [[American philosopher]].

==Life and career==
Hofstadter taught at [[Columbia University]] (1950–67), the [[University of California at Santa Cruz]] (1968–75) and the [[New School for Social Research]] (1976–78).&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/1989/01/28/obituaries/albert-hofstadter-philosopher-78.html?pagewanted=1 "Albert Hofstadter, Philosopher, 78", ''New York Times'', Jan. 28., 1989]&lt;/ref&gt; He was the elder brother of physicist and Nobel laureate [[Robert Hofstadter]] and the uncle of Robert's son, [[Douglas Hofstadter]].

==Thoughts on the later Heidegger==
As a [[Martin Heidegger|Heidegger]] scholar, Hofstadter contends that Heidegger is able to shape and use language in keeping with his basic insight that language is the house of Being, i.e., where humans dwell. "It is by staying with the thinking the language itself does that Heidegger is able to rethink, and thus think anew, the oldest, the perennial and perennially forgotten thoughts."&lt;ref&gt;Heidegger, Martin and Albert Hofstadter. "Introduction," ''Poetry, Language, Thought.''. New York: Harper Collins, 1971, pg. xvi.&lt;/ref&gt; One of these is the Being of beings in the sense of [[aletheia]]. Hofstadter praises Heidegger's project to free human beings from alienated ways of relating to [[Object (philosophy)|thing]]s, "letting us find in it a real dwelling place instead of the cold, sterile hostelry in which we presently find ourselves."&lt;ref&gt;Hofstadter, 1971, pg. xvii.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Alexander García Düttmann''' (born 1961 in Barcelona) studied Philosophy in Frankfurt as a student of [[Alfred Schmidt (philosopher)|Alfred Schmidt]] and in Paris as a student of [[Jacques Derrida]].

== Career ==
After obtaining his PhD from Frankfurt, he spent two years at [[Stanford University]] as a Mellon Fellow. His first academic position in the UK was a lecturership in Philosophy at [[Essex University]]. Currently he is professor of Aesthetics and Art Theory at the [[Berlin University of the Arts]].
He has taught in Melbourne, at Middlesex University, where he was professor of Philosophy for seven years, at New York University, where he was a visiting professor in the autumn term of 1999, and at the [[Goldsmiths, University of London]], where he taught Philosophy and Visual Culture.

== Work ==
Düttmann has published a number of authored books, many of which have been translated into several languages (English, Italian, Croatian, Japanese). His research in the past few years has been focused on the philosophical problem of [[deconstruction]], the concept of exaggeration in philosophy, [[Theodor Adorno]]’s moral philosophy and the work of Italian filmmaker [[Luchino Visconti]]. Yet Visconti turns out to be Düttmann's pretext rather than subject, according to [[Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung]] reviewer Bert Rebhandl: "This is the book's real flaw: We never learn why García Düttmann talks about Visconti at all."&lt;ref&gt;Bert Rebhandl, ''Im Wahn des Mädchens Natalia.'' In: ''[[Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung]]'', 25 January 2008: "Das eigentliche Manko dieses Buchs ist, dass nie deutlich wird, warum García Düttmann über Visconti schreibt."&lt;/ref&gt; 

Currently, Düttmann deals with the question of participation in art and politics; he next will investigate the question of the contemporary in art, the relationship between photography and philosophy and the question of [[immortality]] in contemporary philosophy.

On more than one occasion, he has collaborated with artists. In 2004 the chamber opera Liebeslied / My Suicides, for which he wrote the libretto, and which featured music by Paul Clark and photographs by [[Rut Blees Luxemburg]], opened at the Institute of Contemporary Arts (ICA) in London.

Born in [[Wilmington, Delaware]], he grew up there and in [[West Mystic, Connecticut]]. He was educated at [[Brown University]] and [[Princeton University]].

After short stints teaching at Brown and Princeton, serving in the [[Chemical Warfare Service]] during World War I, and researching at the [[Carnegie Institution for Science]], Buddington settled at Princeton, where he taught for nearly 40 years. He chaired the Department of Geology from 1936 to 1950. He also had a long career with the [[U.S. Geological Survey]] (USGS), doing field work for that agency in [[Alaska]], [[Oregon]], and the [[northeastern United States]].

Buddington was elected to the [[American Philosophical Society]], the [[National Academy of Sciences]], and the [[American Academy of Arts and Sciences]]. His years of work for the USGS earned him the Distinguished Service award of the [[U.S. Department of the Interior]].

==Early life and education==

Buddington was born November 29, 1890, in [[Wilmington, Delaware]], to Mary Salina Buddington (''née'' Wheeler) and Osmer G. Buddington. His parents' families had been in [[Connecticut]] since the 1600s, and he was descended from men who fought for the United States in the [[American Revolution]]. His father was a [[Baptist]] minister who supplemented his income by farming crops and raising chickens.&lt;ref name=gsa-obit/&gt; In 1895 his mother died; his father later married Ella Turner.&lt;ref name=am-obit/&gt; In 1904 the family relocated to [[West Mystic, Connecticut]], where the father became the minister at a church in nearby [[Poquonock Bridge, Connecticut]].&lt;ref name=gsa-obit/&gt;&lt;ref name=brown-catalogue-196&gt;[[Brown University]]. ''The Catalogue of Brown University, 1912–1913'', p. 196.&lt;/ref&gt;

Arthur Buddington was educated in public schools of Wilmington, Mystic, and [[Westerly, Rhode Island]]. In 1908 he graduated from [[Westerly High School]]. He then matriculated at [[Brown University]]. After an unpleasant year in the [[liberal arts]] program, he switched to the sciences. He graduated second in his class in 1912&lt;ref name=gsa-obit/&gt; with a bachelor's degree in [[geology]], [[chemistry]], and [[physics]].&lt;ref name=brown-catalogue-196/&gt; He was also elected to [[Sigma Xi]] in 1912.&lt;ref&gt;Brown ''Catalogue'', p. 251.&lt;/ref&gt;

After graduating Buddington remained at Brown to earn a [[master of science]] degree in 1913, writing a [[master's thesis]] on [[fossiliferous]] [[Carboniferous]] [[shales]] that had recently been discovered on [[College Hill, Providence, Rhode Island|College Hill]],&lt;ref name=gsa-obit/&gt; on which Brown is situated.&lt;ref&gt;[[Brown University]].

Accessed Feb. 11, 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; That same year he enrolled in graduate school at [[Princeton University]] to study under [[Charles Henry Smyth, Jr.]], who was doing some of the first work in chemical petrology (using [[chemistry]] to study ordinary rocks rather than minerals) in the United States. Buddington earned his [[Ph.D.]] from Princeton in 1916.&lt;ref name=am-obit/&gt;

==Career==

Accessed Feb. 12, 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; where Buddington was a Ph.D. student, a professor, and department chair.]]

After earning his Ph.D. Buddington had a series of brief appointments. He was first a postdoctoral fellow at Princeton, but in 1917 he took a position teaching at Brown. In early 1918, with [[World War I]] raging, he returned to Princeton to teach military aerial observation in its aviation ground school.&lt;ref name=gsa-obit/&gt; Specifically he taught map-reading, range-finding, and [[telegraphy]].&lt;ref&gt;Oscar M. Voorhees, ed. ''The [[Phi Beta Kappa]] Key'', Oct. 1918, p. 396.&lt;/ref&gt; In April he enlisted as a [[Private (rank)|private]] in the [[U.S. Army]]'s [[Signal Corps (United States Army)|Signal Corps]].&lt;ref name=gsa-obit/&gt; He trained briefly as an aerial observer and photo interpreter before being reassigned to the [[Chemical Warfare Service]], where he did research under [[Richard C. Tolman]].&lt;ref name=am-obit/&gt; He was discharged at war's end in 1919 as a [[sergeant first class]]&lt;ref&gt;[[Brown University]] War Records Committee. ''Brown University in the War'', 1919, p. 52.&lt;/ref&gt; and then returned to Brown once again to teach. Later that year he joined the Geophysical Laboratory of the [[Carnegie Institution for Science]] in [[Washington, D.C.]]&lt;ref name=gsa-obit/&gt;

In 1920 Buddington was appointed assistant professor at Princeton, where he remained until retiring in 1959. He put a great emphasis on teaching. Each year he gave a senior-level undergraduate course in [[petrology]] and one graduate course in petrology or [[chemical geology]]. As chair of the Department of Geology from 1936 to 1950, he built Princeton's reputation in petrology and studies of ore in addition to its traditional strength in [[paleontology]].&lt;ref name=gsa-obit/&gt; [[Harry Hammond Hess]] and [[John Tuzo Wilson]] were among his students.&lt;ref&gt;Harold L. James. [http://www.encyclopedia.com/doc/1G2-2830905040.html Buddington, Arthur Francis]. ''[[Complete Dictionary of Scientific Biography]]'', 2008. Accessed Feb. 13, 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;

Buddington also had a long association with the [[U.S. Geological Survey]] (USGS). He spent the summers from 1921 to 1925 producing [[geologic map]]s of southeastern [[Alaska]]. The summer of 1930 was devoted to mapping [[Oregon]] portions of the [[Cascade Range]]. In 1943 the USGS appointed him head of what would become a 17-year field project on the [[iron ores]] of the [[northeastern United States]]. This large collaboration produced some important scientific results and identified several economically compelling ore deposits.&lt;ref name=gsa-obit/&gt;

==Later life and legacy==

Despite formally retiring in 1959, Buddington remained active. That same year he was named Elmer Bair Professor of Geology,&lt;ref&gt;[[UAA/APU Consortium Library]].

Accessed Feb. 11, 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; and he published 23 papers in the following years. He died December 25, 1980,&lt;ref name=gsa-obit/&gt; in [[Quincy, Massachusetts]], and was buried in Princeton.&lt;ref name=am-obit/&gt;

[[Buddingtonite]] is named in his honor.&lt;ref name=gsa-obit/&gt;

==Personal life==

During his time at the Geophysical Laboratory, Buddington met Jene Elizabeth Muntz, originally of [[David City, Nebraska]]. They married in 1924 and remained married until her death in 1975. She played an important role in his field work: he had never learned to drive a car, so she drove him through the Adirondacks. They had one child, a daughter.&lt;ref name=gsa-obit/&gt;

      <comment>/* Works on religion and deism */ We can't, as Wikipedia editors, normally read people's minds to say whether or not they are "sincere", so we shouldn't make those judgments without citing a source. But the point here is that the insincerity is not discerned by reading his mind - it is patent on the face of what he wrote.</comment>

'''Charles Blount''' (27 April 1654 – August 1693) was an [[England|English]] [[deism|deist]] and [[philosopher]] who published several anonymous essays critical of the existing English order.

==Life==
Blount was born in [[Upper Holloway]],&lt;ref name=EB1911&gt;{{cite EB1911|wstitle=Blount, Charles}}&lt;/ref&gt; Islington, Middlesex, the fourth son of Sir [[Henry Blount]].  His father educated him at home and exposed him to freethinking philosophy.  In 1672 Charles inherited lands in Islington and the estate of Blount's Hall in [[Staffordshire]].  He married Eleanor Tyrrell in [[Westminster Abbey]] at the end of 1672; they had three sons and a daughter.  Throughout his life he remained at Blount's Hall as a leisured gentleman, although he also travelled to [[London]] to participate in courtly life.

Blount's publications were consistently anonymous or written under a pseudonym, and with a radical or [[British Whig Party|Whig]] slant. In 1673 he wrote ''Mr Dreyden Vindicated'', defending [[John Dryden]]'s ''[[The Conquest of Granada]]'' from [[Richard Leigh (poet)|Richard Leigh]]'s attacks.  In 1673 he also penned the anonymous ''The Friendly Vindication.''

In 1678 Blount became a member of the [[Green Ribbon Club]], a group of radical Whig advocates and activists. In 1679 he published ''An Appeal from the Country to the City'' under the name of [[Junius Brutus]].  It was a strongly Whig piece that suggested that the [[Popish Plot]] was entirely real.  It painted a lurid picture of what life in London would be like under [[James II of England|James II]] and [[Roman Catholicism]].  In this case, the printer was seized and fined, and the pamphlet was burned by the common hangman (i.e. a symbolic execution of the book for treason).  The same year, he assumed the name of Philopatris ("lover of his country") to write ''A Just Vindication of Learning,'' which was an argument against the [[Licensing Act 1662|act licensing printers]].  He mimicked [[John Milton]]'s previous ''[[Areopagitica]].''  After the death of [[Thomas Hobbes]] Blount produced an anonymous broadsheet of "sayings" from Hobbes' book ''[[Leviathan (Hobbes book)|Leviathan]].'' &lt;ref&gt;''The last sayings, or, Dying legacy of Mr. Thomas Hobbs of Malmesbury who departed this life on Thursday, Decemb. 4, 1679'', London, 1680.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1693 Blount used his ironic approach to argue for the validity of [[William III of England|William and Mary]].  His ''King William and Queen Mary Conquerors'' argued that they were, in fact, conquerors of England, since they landed with force; therefore the people should support them as able protectors, as Hobbes had argued that the people should obey anyone who represented such force.  This pamphlet was licensed by the [[Tory]] licensor, [[Edmund Bohun]].  In 1695 [[Parliament of England|Parliament]] debated the fate of the work and had it, too, burned by the common hangman; and Bohun lost his position.&lt;ref&gt;Dorothy Auchter, ''Dictionary of Literary and Dramatic Censorship in Tudor and Stuart England'' (2001), pp. 179-183&lt;/ref&gt; The Act for the licensing of the press was allowed to expire, as well.&lt;ref&gt;The 1662 Licensing Act was not renewed when it expired in May 1695.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1689 Blount's wife had died, and he wanted to marry her sister, but such marriages were illegal at that time in England. He wrote to the [[Archbishop of Canterbury]] in 1693 and requested permission, but was denied. In August 1693 he committed suicide.&lt;ref name=EB1911/&gt; Alexander Pope wrote in a footnote to his 'Epilogue to the Satires: Dialogue I' that Blount, 'being in love with a near kinswoman of his, and rejected, gave himself a stab in the arm, as pretending to kill himself, of the consequence of which he really died'.&lt;ref&gt;Footnote to line 123; Alexander Pope, 'Epilogue to the Satires Dialogue I', ''Alexander Pope: The Major Works'', ed. Pat Rogers (2008), p.398.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Works on religion and deism==
In 1679 Blount published, anonymously, ''Anima Mundi'', an essay that appeared to review pagan theories of the [[Soul (spirit)|soul]] and [[afterlife]].  Throughout, Blount says that it is perfectly clear that the soul is immortal and that there is an afterlife, but his statements are made in a way that makes them absurd, and lengthy descriptions of other views are then juxtaposed with patently insincere claims that the [[Christian Church|Church]] must be correct. [[Henry Compton (bishop)|Henry Compton]], then [[bishop of London]], argued that the book should be suppressed, but while Compton was out of the city, enthusiastic opponents of the work had it publicly burned. The same year, Blount sent a copy of the work to [[Thomas Hobbes]], whose philosophy Blount admired, with a letter in praise of [[Arianism]], which was then published.

Blount's deist publications came in 1680, with ''Great Diana of the Ephesians'' and ''The Two First Books of Philostratus concerning the Life of Apollonius Tyaneus''. The two works appear to be translations and history. However, the notes in the work attacked [[Christianity]] directly. First, Blount suggested that rational religion was destroyed by the Church. Second, his decrying of pagan sacrifices was a coded attack on [[eucharist]]ic doctrine and Church practice. He attached extensive notes which mocked "priestcraft" and corrupt priests.

He followed this with a smaller work, ''Miracles, No Violations of the Laws of Nature'' (1683), which contained only quotations from [[Thomas Burnet]], Hobbes, and [[Baruch Spinoza]], combined to say that accounts of miracles are without any empirical basis.

He also wrote his own ''Religio laici'' (1683) to answer [[John Dryden]]'s ''Religio Laici'' (1682) and its attacks on deism.

In 1693 he wrote, anonymously, ''The Oracles of Reason.'' It was a miscellany of essays, some by [[Charles Gildon]] (whose presence in the volume may or may not have been intended by Blount).  The essays expressed doubts about the [[Book of Genesis]], denied the possibility of [[revelation]], denied miracles, and suggested that there might be many worlds with life on them.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1476">{{Immanuel Kant}}

Attributed to [[Immanuel Kant]], the '''critical philosophy''' ({{lang-de|kritische Philosophie}}) movement sees the primary task of [[philosophy]] as [[criticism]] rather than justification of knowledge; criticism, for Kant, meant judging as to the possibilities of knowledge before advancing to knowledge itself (from the Greek ''kritike (techne)'', or "art of judgment"). The basic task of philosophers, according to this view, is not to establish and demonstrate theories about reality, but rather to subject all theories—including those about philosophy itself—to critical review, and measure their validity by how well they withstand criticism.

"Critical philosophy" is also used as another name for Kant's philosophy itself. Kant said that philosophy's proper enquiry is not about what is out there in reality, but rather about the character and foundations of experience itself. We must first judge how human reason works, and within what limits, so that we can afterwards correctly apply it to [[empirical evidence|sense experience]] and determine whether it can be applied at all to metaphysical objects.

{{nihongo|'''Daisen-in'''|大仙院}} is a sub-temple of [[Daitoku-ji]], a temple of the [[Rinzai]] school of [[Zen]] in  [[Buddhism]], one of the five most important Zen temples of [[Kyoto]]. The name means "The Academy of the Great Immortals."  Daisen-in was founded by the Zen priest {{nihongo|Kogaku Sōkō|古岳宗亘}} (1464–1548), and was built between 1509 and 1513.&lt;ref&gt;Danielle Elisseeff, Jardins japonais, pg. 62–63.&lt;/ref&gt;    Daisen-in is noted for its screen paintings and for its [[kare-sansui]], or dry landscape garden.

The [[fusuma|screen paintings]] inside the temple and the garden are attributed to [[Sōami]]  (died in 1525), a zen monk, ink painter and follower of the sect of the [[Amida Buddha]]. He was particularly known for his use of diluted ink to create delicate and nuanced, misty and ethereal landscapes. His work was influenced by the ink landscape paintings of the [[Song Dynasty]] in China. According to art historian Miyeko Murase, the work of Soami represents "the very essence of the serenity of nature, the sacred ideal of all the zen monks and ink painters of the [[Muromachi period]]".&lt;ref&gt;Miyeko Murase, ''L'Art du Japon'', pg. 201.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Rock garden==
In spite of all the interpretations that were attached to this garden in later centuries, its creation was not primarily related to religious Zen: it is a good example of a Chinese style landscape, done as painting in three dimensions, as was demonstrated by Wybe Kuitert.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last = Kuitert | first = Wybe | title =  Composition of Scenery in Japanese Pre-Modern Gardens and the Three Distances of Guo Xi| journal = Studies in the History of Gardens &amp; Designed Landscapes | volume = 33 | issue = 1 | pages = 1–15 | publisher = Taylor and Francis |date=March 2013 | doi = 10.1080/02666286.2012.753189 }}&lt;!--| accessdate = 2013-03-25--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; This author also give a most detailed account of the history of the garden. Though the garden is attributed to monk-painter Soami, there is no written evidence that he was also a gardener. Kuitert suggests that the name "Soami" may have been used as a euphemism for garden makers who were of the untouchable ''kawaramono'' class and not versed in Buddhism.&lt;ref&gt;Kuitert, Wybe, (2002). ''Themes in the History of Japanese Garden Art'' Hawaii University Press, pg. 95-98.&lt;/ref&gt;
The main garden, is in an L shape, to the northeast of and facing the shoin, the study of the ''hojo'', the residence of the head of the monastery. This part of the garden is a narrow strip just 3.7 meters wide, It contains a miniature landscape similar to a Song Dynasty landscape painting, composed of rocks suggesting mountains and a waterfall, clipped shrubs and trees representing a forest, and raked white gravel representing a river. The "river" splits into branches, one of which flows into a "Middle Sea" of raked white gravel and a few rocks; the other flows through a gate to a larger "Ocean" of white gravel. In the river are several symbolic stones; one resembles a boat moving with the current, and the other resembles the back of a turtle trying to swim upstream. The "Ocean" has two cone-shaped hills of gravel, suggesting mountains. The "Middle Sea" and The "Ocean" Sea are connected by another passage of white gravel west of the building.   The "Ocean" and the "Middle Sea" are both believed to be later additions to the original garden.&lt;ref&gt;Young and Young, ''The Art of the Japanese Garden'', pg. 110.&lt;/ref&gt;

American garden historians David and Michigo Young suggest that the garden may represent a metaphorical journey through life: the waterfall/river/sea may represent youth, maturity, and old age, or the search for wisdom. The rocks in the "rivers" may suggest obstacles. The "Ocean" at the end of the voyage may be the return to the eternal at the end of life.&lt;ref&gt;Young and Young, ''The Art of the Japanese Garden'', pg. 110.&lt;/ref&gt;

French author Danielle Elisseeff sees the garden as divided into four spaces representing four themes; the first is the waterfall, or the impetuous beginning life; the second is the gate, symbolizing the passages of life. This theme features the stone "turtle" struggling upstream against the current, and the  "treasure boat" moving downstream with the current: the third is the Middle Sea; and the fourth is the Ocean, the final destination of calm and serenity.&lt;ref&gt;Daniele Elisseeff, ''Jardins japonais'', pg. 62&lt;/ref&gt;

German author Gunter Nitschke gives a similar explanation. He writes that the garden is "the life of man in symbolic form." The mountain at the beginning of the garden is Mount Horai, the traditional meeting place of the [[Eight Immortals]] in [[Daoist]] legends, symbolized by a [[camellia]]. He observes that, in the corner of the "ocean" at the end of the voyage is a single "tree of bodhi,"  the traditional Buddhist symbol of the fig tree under which the Buddha sat when he attained enlightenment. Nitschke writes that the "treasure boat" stone represents the accumulation of experience during an adult life, and the "turtle" stone represents futile efforts to return to youth.&lt;ref&gt;Nitschke, Le jardin japonais, pg. 92-93,&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Lucretius, De rerum natura.jpg|thumb|Opening of the 1483 manuscript copy of ''De rerum natura'' by Girolamo di Matteo de Tauris, which had been copied for [[Pope Sixtus IV]].]]
'''''De rerum natura''''' ({{IPA-la|deːˈreːrũn&lt;!-- FOR INFO ON WHY THIS IS AN "N" INSTEAD OF AN "M", SEE: https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk%3ABrutal_Russian&amp;type=revision&amp;diff=825617811&amp;oldid=825527381 --&gt;.naːˈtuːraː|lang}}; '''''On the Nature of Things''''') is a first-century BC [[Didacticism|didactic]] poem by the [[Roman Republic|Roman]] [[poet]] and [[Philosophy|philosopher]] [[Lucretius]] (c. 99 BC – c. 55 BC) with the goal of explaining [[Epicureanism|Epicurean philosophy]] to a Roman audience. The poem, written in some 7,400 [[dactylic hexameter]]s, is divided into six untitled books, and explores Epicurean physics through poetic language and metaphors.&lt;ref name=TNY&gt;[[#Greenblatt1|Greenblatt (2011)]].&lt;/ref&gt; Namely, Lucretius explores the principles of [[atomism]]; the nature of the [[mind]] and [[soul]]; explanations of [[Sense|sensation]] and [[thought]]; the development of the [[world]] and its phenomena; and explains a variety of [[Celestial sphere|celestial]] and [[Earth|terrestrial]] phenomena. The [[universe]] described in the poem operates according to these physical principles, guided by ''fortuna'' ("chance"),&lt;ref&gt;In particular, ''De rerum natura'' 5.107 (''fortuna gubernans'', "guiding chance" or "fortune at the helm"). See: [[#Gale19941996|Gale (1996) [1994]]], pp. 213, 223{{en dash}}24.&lt;/ref&gt; and not the divine intervention of the [[Religion in ancient Rome|traditional Roman deities]].

==Background==

[[File:Lucretius1.png|thumb|right|''De rerum natura'' was written by the Roman poet [[Lucretius]].]]

To the Greek philosopher [[Epicurus]], the unhappiness and degradation of [[human]]s arose largely from the dread which they entertained of the power of the [[Greek gods|deities]], from terror of their wrath. This wrath was supposed to be displayed by the misfortunes inflicted in this life and by the everlasting tortures that were the lot of the guilty in a future state (or, where these feelings were not strongly developed, from a vague dread of gloom and misery after death). Epicurus thus made it his mission to remove these fears, and thus to establish tranquility in the minds of his readers. To do this, Epicurus invoked the [[atomism]] of [[Democritus]] to demonstrate that the material universe was formed not by a [[Supreme Being]], but by the mixing of elemental particles that had existed from all eternity governed by certain simple laws. He argued that the deities (whose existence he did not deny) lived forevermore in the enjoyment of absolute peace{{em dash}}strangers to all the passions, desires, and fears, which affect humans{{em dash}} and totally indifferent to the world and its inhabitants, unmoved alike by their virtues and their crimes. This meant that humans had nothing to fear from them.

Lucretius's task was to clearly state and fully develop these views in an attractive form; his work was an attempt to show through poetry that everything in nature can be explained by natural laws, without the need for the intervention of divine beings.&lt;ref name="ramsay"&gt;[[#Ramsay|Ramsay (1867)]], pp. 829{{en dash}}30.&lt;/ref&gt; Lucretius identifies the [[supernatural]] with the notion that the deities created our world or interfere with its operations in some way. He argues against fear of such deities by demonstrating, through observations and arguments, that the operations of the world can be accounted for in terms of natural phenomena. These phenomena are the result of regular, but purposeless motions and interactions of tiny [[atom]]s in empty space.

==Contents==

===Synopsis===

The poem consists of six untitled books, in [[dactylic hexameter]]. The first three books provide a fundamental account of being and nothingness, matter and space, the atoms and their movement, the infinity of the universe both as regards time and space, the regularity of reproduction (no prodigies, everything in its proper habitat), the nature of mind (''animus'', directing thought) and spirit (''anima'', sentience) as material bodily entities, and their mortality, since, according to Lucretius, they and their functions (consciousness, pain) end with the bodies that contain them and with which they are interwoven. The last three books give an atomic and materialist explanation of phenomena preoccupying human reflection, such as vision and the senses, [[Sexuality in ancient Rome#Epicurean sexuality|sex and reproduction]], natural forces and agriculture, the heavens, and disease.

[[File:Ares e Afrodite.JPG|thumb|300px|right|Lucretius opens his poem by addressing [[Venus (goddess)|Venus]] (''center''), urging her to pacify her lover, Mars (''right''). Given Lucretius's relatively secular philosophy and his eschewing of superstition, his invocation of Venus has caused much debate.]]

Lucretius opens his poem by addressing [[Venus (goddess)|Venus]] not only as the mother of Rome (''Aeneadum genetrix'') but also as the veritable [[Mother Nature|mother of nature]] (''Alma Venus''), urging her to pacify her lover [[Mars (god)|Mars]] and spare Rome from strife.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Leonard|Leonard (1916)]].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=lucretius_stanford/&gt; By recalling the opening to poems by [[Homer]], [[Ennius]], and [[Hesiod]] (all of which begin with an invocation to [[the Muses]]), the proem to ''De rerum natura'' conforms to epic convention. The entire proem is also written in the format of a hymn, recalling other early literary works, texts, and hymns and in particular the Homeric Hymn to Aphrodite.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Keith|Keith (2012)]], p. 39.&lt;/ref&gt; The choice to address Venus may have been due to [[Empedocles]]'s belief that Aphrodite represents "the great creative force in the cosmos".&lt;ref name=lucretius_stanford&gt;[[#Sedley|Sedley (2013) [2004]]].&lt;/ref&gt; Given that Lucretius goes on to argue that the gods are removed from human life, many have thus seen this opening to be contradictory: how can Lucretius pray to Venus and then deny that the gods listen to or care about human affairs?&lt;ref name=lucretius_stanford/&gt; In response, many scholars argue that the poet uses Venus poetically as a [[metonym]]. For instance, Diskin Clay sees Venus as a poetic substitute for sex, and Bonnie Catto sees the invocation of the name as a metonym for the "creative process of ''natura''".&lt;ref&gt;[[#Catto|Catto (1988)]], p. 98.&lt;/ref&gt;

After the opening, the poem commences with an enunciation of the proposition on the nature and being of the deities, which leads to an invective against the evils of [[superstition]]. Lucretius then dedicates time to exploring the [[axiom]] that [[nothing]] can be produced from nothing, and that nothing can be reduced to nothing (''Nil fieri ex nihilo, in nihilum nil posse reverti''). Following this, the poet argues that the universe comprises an [[Infinity|infinite]] number of [[Atomism|Atoms]], which are scattered about in an infinite and vast void (''Inane''). The shape of these atoms, their properties, their movements, the laws under which they enter into combination and assume forms and qualities appreciable by the senses, with other preliminary matters on their nature and affections, together with a refutation of objections and opposing [[Hypothesis|hypotheses]], occupy the first two books.&lt;ref name=ramsay /&gt;

In the third book, the general concepts proposed thus far are applied to demonstrate that the vital and intellectual principles, the ''Anima'' and ''Animus'', are as much a part of us as are our limbs and members, but like those limbs and members have no distinct and independent existence, and that hence soul and [[Human body|body]] live and perish together; the book concludes by arguing that the fear of death is a folly, as death merely extinguishes all feeling{{em dash}}both the good and the bad.&lt;ref name=ramsay /&gt;

The fourth book is devoted to the theory of the senses, [[Visual perception|sight]], [[Hearing (sense)|hearing]], [[taste]], [[Olfaction|smell]], of [[sleep]] and of [[dream]]s, ending with a disquisition upon [[Sexuality in ancient Rome#Epicurean sexuality|love and sex]].&lt;ref name=ramsay /&gt;

The fifth book is described by Ramsay as the most finished and impressive,&lt;ref name=ramsay /&gt; while Stahl argues that its "puerile conceptions" is proof that Lucretius should be judged as a poet, not as a scientist.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Stahl|Stahl (1962)]], pp. 82{{en dash}}83.&lt;/ref&gt;  This book addresses the origin of the [[world]] and of all things therein, the movements of the heavenly bodies, the changing of the [[season]]s, [[day]] and [[night]], the rise and progress of humankind, [[society]],  political institutions, and the invention of the various [[The arts|arts]] and [[science]]s which embellish and ennoble life.&lt;ref name=ramsay /&gt;

The sixth book contains an explanation of some of the most striking natural appearances, especially [[thunder]], [[lightning]], [[hail]], [[rain]], [[snow]], [[ice]], [[cold]], [[heat]], [[wind]], [[earthquake]]s, [[volcano]]es, [[Spring (hydrosphere)|springs]] and localities noxious to [[animal]] life, which leads to a discourse upon [[disease]]s. This introduces a detailed description of the [[Plague of Athens|great pestilence]] that devastated [[Classical Athens|Athens]] during the [[Peloponnesian War]]. With this episode, the book closes; this abrupt ending suggests that Lucretius might have died before he was able to finalize and fully edit his poem.&lt;ref name=ramsay /&gt;

===Purpose===

Lucretius wrote this epic poem to "Memmius", who may be [[Gaius Memmius (poet)|Gaius Memmius]], who in 58 BC was a [[praetor]], a judicial official deciding controversies between citizens and the government.&lt;ref name="Englert2003"&gt;[[#Englert|Englert (2003)]], p. xii.&lt;/ref&gt; There are over a dozen references to "Memmius" scattered throughout the long poem in a variety of contexts in translation, such as "Memmius mine", "my Memmius", and "illustrious Memmius". According to Lucretius's frequent statements in his poem, the main purpose of the work was to free Gaius Memmius's mind of the [[supernatural]] and the [[fear]] of [[death]]—and to induct him into a state of ''[[ataraxia]]'' by expounding the philosophical system of [[Epicurus]], whom Lucretius glorifies as the hero of his epic poem.

However, the purpose of the poem is subject to ongoing scholarly debate. Lucretius refers to Memmius by name four times in the first book, three times in the second, five in the fifth, and not at all in the third, fourth, or sixth books. In relation to this discrepancy in the frequency of Lucretius's reference to the apparent subject of his poem, Kannengiesse advances the theory that Lucretius wrote the first version of ''De rerum natura'' for the reader at large, and subsequently revised in order to write it for Memmius. However, Memmius' name is central to several critical verses in the poem, and this theory has therefore been largely discredited.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Stearns|Stearns (1931)]], p. 67.&lt;/ref&gt; The German classicists [[Ivo Bruns]] and Samuel Brandt set forth an alternative theory that Lucretius did at first write the poem with Memmius in mind, but that his enthusiasm for his patron cooled.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Bruns|Bruns (1884)]].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[#Brandt|Brandt (1885)]].&lt;/ref&gt; Stearns suggests that this is because Memmius reneged on a promise to pay for a new school to be built on the site of the old Epicurean school.&lt;ref name=stearns68/&gt; Memmius was also a tribune in 66, praetor in 58, governor of Bithynia in 57, and was a candidate for the consulship in 54 but was disqualified for bribery, and Stearns suggests that the warm relationship between patron and client may have cooled (''sed tua me virtus tamen et sperata voluptas'' / ''suavis amicitiae quemvis efferre laborem'', "But still your merit, and as I hope, the joy / Of our sweet friendship, urge me to any toil").&lt;ref name=stearns68&gt;[[#Stearns|Stearns (1931)]], p. 68.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Lucretius]], ''De rerum natura'' 1.140.&lt;/ref&gt;

There is a certain irony to the poem, namely that while Lucretius extols the virtue of the Epicurean school of thought, Epicurus himself had advised his acolytes from penning poetry because he believed it to make that which was simple overly complicated.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Lucretius-De-May|Lucretius &amp; de May (2009)]], v.&lt;/ref&gt; Near the end of his first book, Lucretius defends his fusion of Epicureanism and poetry with a [[simile]], arguing that the philosophy he espouses is like a medicine: life-saving but often unpleasant. Poetry, on the other hand, is like honey, in that it is a "a sweetener that sugarcoats the bitter medicine of Epicurean philosophy and entices the audience to swallow it."&lt;ref&gt;[[Lucretius]], ''De rerum natura'' 1.936{{en dash}}50.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[#Keith|Keith (2013)]], p. 46.&lt;/ref&gt; (Of note, Lucretius repeats these 25 lines, almost verbatim, in the introduction to the fourth book.)&lt;ref&gt;[[Lucretius]], ''De rerum natura'' 4.1{{en dash}}25.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Completeness===

The state of the poem as it currently exists suggests that it was released in an unfinished state.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Butterfield|Butterfield (2013)]], p. 2.&lt;/ref&gt; For instance, the poem concludes rather abruptly, there are dual passages throughout, and at 5.155 Lucretius mentions that he will spend a great deal of time discussing the nature of the gods, which never comes to pass.&lt;ref name=ramsay /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[#Butterfield|Butterfield (2013)]], p. 2, note 7.&lt;/ref&gt; Some have suggested that Lucretius died before being able to edit, finalize, and publish his work.&lt;ref&gt;[[#West|West (2007)]], p. 13.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Main ideas==

===Metaphysics===

====Lack of divine intervention====

After the poem was rediscovered and made its rounds across Europe and beyond, numerous thinkers began to see Lucretius's Epicureanism as a "threat synonymous with atheism."&lt;ref name=sheppard31/&gt; Some Christian apologists viewed ''De rerum natura'' as an [[atheist]] manifesto and a dangerous foil to be thwarted.&lt;ref name=sheppard31&gt;[[#Sheppard|Sheppard (2015)]], p. 31.&lt;/ref&gt; However, at that time the label was extremely broad and did not necessarily mean a denial of divine entities (for example, some large Christian sects labelled dissenting groups as atheists).&lt;ref&gt;[[#Sheppard|Sheppard (2015)]], pp. 21–23.&lt;/ref&gt; What is more, Lucretius does not deny the existence of deities;&lt;ref name=palmer26&gt;[[#Palmer|Palmer (2014)]], p. 26. "Lucretius was a theist."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[#Bullivant|Bullivant &amp; Ruse 2013]]. "To be sure, Lucretius and Epicurus are not professed atheists [but] the resulting theism is one that denies providence and rejects transcendentalism."&lt;/ref&gt; he simply argues that they did not create the universe, that they do not care about human affairs, and that they do not intervene in the world.&lt;ref name="sheppard31"/&gt; Regardless, due to the ideas espoused in the poem, much of Lucretius's work was seen by many as direct a challenge to theistic, Christian belief.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Sheppard|Sheppard (2015)]], p. 29.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Ada Palmer]] has labelled six ideas in Lucretius's thought (viz. his assertion that the world was created from chaos, and his denials of Providence, divine participation, miracles, the efficacy of prayer, and an afterlife) as "proto-atheistic".&lt;ref&gt;[[#Palmer|Palmer (2014)]], p. 25.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=palmer26again&gt;[[#Palmer|Palmer (2014)]], p. 26.&lt;/ref&gt; She qualifies her use of this term, cautioning that it is not to be used to say that Lucretius was himself an atheist in the modern sense of the word, nor that atheism is a [[teleology|teleological]] necessity, but rather that many of his ideas were taken up by 19th, 20th, and 21st century atheists.&lt;ref name=palmer26again/&gt;

====Repudiation of immortality====

''De rerum natura'' does not argue that the soul does not exist; rather, the poem claims that the soul, like all things in existence, is made up of atoms, and because these atoms will one day drift apart, the human soul is not immortal. Lucretius thus argues that death is simply annihilation, and that there is no [[afterlife]]. He likens the physical body to a vessel that holds both the mind (''mens'') and spirit (''anima''). To prove that neither the mind nor spirit can survive independent of the body, Lucretius uses a simple analogy: when a vessel shatters, its contents spill everywhere; likewise, when the body dies, the mind and spirit dissipate. And as a simple ceasing-to-be, death can be neither good nor bad for this being, since a dead person{{em dash}}being completely devoid of sensation and thought{{em dash}}cannot miss being alive.&lt;ref name=lucretius_stanford/&gt; To further alleviate the fear of non-existence, Lucretius makes use of the [[symmetry argument]]: he argues that the [[eternal oblivion]] awaiting all humans after death is exactly the same as the infinite nothingness that preceded our birth. Since that nothingness (which in fact, was like a deep, peaceful sleep) caused us no pain or discomfort, we should not fear the same nothingness that will follow our own demise:&lt;ref name=lucretius_stanford/&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
:Look back again{{em dash}}how the endless ages of time comes to pass
:Before our birth are nothing to us. This is a looking glass
:Nature holds up for us in which we see the time to come
:After we finally die. What is there that looks so fearsome?
:What's so tragic? Isn't it more peaceful than any sleep?&lt;ref&gt;[[Lucretius]], ''De rerum natura'' 3.972{{en dash}}76.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

According to the ''[[Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy]]'', Lucretius sees those who fear death as embracing the fallacious assumption that they will be present in some sense "to regret and bewail [their] own non-existence."&lt;ref name=lucretius_stanford/&gt;

===Physics===

Lucretius maintained that he could free humankind from fear of the deities by demonstrating that all things occur by natural causes without any intervention by the deities. Historians of science, however, have been critical of the limitations of his Epicurean approach to science, especially as it pertained to [[astronomy|astronomical]] topics, which he relegated to the class of "unclear" objects.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Lloyd|Lloyd (1973)]], p. 26.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[#Stahl|Stahl (1962)]], pp. 81{{en dash}}83.&lt;/ref&gt;

Thus, he began his discussion by claiming that he would
&lt;blockquote&gt;explain by what forces nature steers the courses of the Sun and the journeyings of the Moon, so that we shall not suppose that they run their yearly races between heaven and earth of their own free will [i.e., are gods themselves] or that they are rolled round in furtherance of some divine plan....&lt;ref&gt;[[Lucretius]], ''De rerum natura'' 5.76{{en dash}}81.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

However, when he set out to put this plan into practice, he limited himself to showing how one, or several different, naturalistic accounts could explain certain natural phenomena. He was unable to tell his readers how to determine which of these alternatives might be the true one.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Alioto|Alioto (1987)]], p. 97.&lt;/ref&gt; For instance, when considering the reason for stellar movements, Lucretius provides two possible explanations: that the sky itself rotates, or that the sky as a whole is stationary while constellations move.  If the latter is true, Lucretius, notes, this is because: "either swift currents of ether whirl round and round and roll their fires at large across the nocturnal regions of the sky"; "an external current of air from some other quarter may whirl them along in their course"; or "they may swim of their own accord, each responsive to the call of its own food, and feed their fiery bodies in the broad pastures of the sky". Lucretius concludes that "one of these causes must certainly operate in our world... But to lay down which of them it is lies beyond the range of our stumbling progress."&lt;ref&gt;[[Lucretius]], ''De rerum natura'' 5.510{{en dash}}533.&lt;/ref&gt;

Drawing on these, and other passages, William Stahl considered that "The anomalous and derivative character of the scientific portions of Lucretius' poem makes it reasonable to conclude that his significance should be judged as a poet, not as a scientist."&lt;ref&gt;[[#Stahl|Stahl (1962)]], p. 83.&lt;/ref&gt;

====The swerve====

{{Main|Clinamen}}

[[Determinism]] appears to conflict with the concept of [[free will]]. Lucretius attempts to allow for free will in his [[physicalism|physicalistic]] universe by postulating an [[indeterminism|indeterministic]] tendency for atoms to veer randomly ({{lang-la|[[clinamen]]}}, literally "the turning aside of a thing", but often translated as "the swerve").&lt;ref name=TNY/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[#Lewis-&amp;-Short|Lewis &amp; Short (1879)]].&lt;/ref&gt; According to Lucretius, this unpredictable swerve occurs at no fixed place or time:

&lt;blockquote&gt;When atoms move straight down through the void by their own weight, they deflect a bit in space at a quite uncertain time and in uncertain places, just enough that you could say that their motion has changed. But if they were not in the habit of swerving, they would all fall straight down through the depths of the void, like drops of rain, and no collision would occur, nor would any blow be produced among the atoms. In that case, nature would never have produced anything.&lt;ref&gt;[[Lucretius]], ''De rerum natura'' 2.216{{en dash}}224.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[#Lucretius-Inwood|Lucretius, Inwood, &amp; Gerson (1994)]], pp. 65{{en dash}}66.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

This swerving provides the indeterminacy that Lucretius argues allows for the "free will which living things throughout the world have" (''libera per terras'' ... ''haec animantibus exstat'' ... ''voluntas'').&lt;ref&gt;[[Lucretius]], ''De rerum natura'' 2.256{{en dash}}57.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Textual history==

===Classical antiquity to the Middle Ages===

[[File:MatthiasStom-SaintJerome-Nantes.jpg|thumb|right|[[St. Jerome]] contended in his ''[[Chronicon (Jerome)|Chronicon]]'' that Cicero amended and edited ''De rerum natura''. This assertion has been hotly debated, with most scholars thinking it was a mistake on Jerome's part.]]

[[Martin Ferguson Smith]] notes that [[Cicero]]'s close friend, [[Titus Pomponius Atticus]], was an Epicurean publisher, and it is possible his slaves made the very first copies of ''De rerum natura''.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Smith&amp;Rouse|Smith (1992) [1924]]], pp. xiii{{en dash}}xiv.&lt;/ref&gt; If this were the case, then it might explain how Cicero came to be familiar with Lucretius's work.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Smith&amp;Rouse|Smith (1992) [1924]]], p. xiii.&lt;/ref&gt; In c. AD 380, [[St. Jerome]] would contend in his ''[[Chronicon (Jerome)|Chronicon]]'' that Cicero amended and edited ''De rerum natura'',&lt;ref&gt;[[Jerome]], ''[[Chronicon (Jerome)|Chronicon]]''.&lt;/ref&gt; although most scholars argue that this is an erroneous claim;&lt;ref name=butterfield1n4/&gt; the classicist David Butterfield argues that this mistake was likely made by Jerome (or his sources) because the earliest reference to Lucretius is in the aforementioned letter from Cicero.&lt;ref name=butterfield1n4&gt;[[#Butterfield|Butterfield (2013)]], p. 1, note 4.&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless, a small minority of scholars argue that Jerome's assertion may be credible.&lt;ref name=lucretius_stanford/&gt;

The oldest purported fragments of ''De rerum natura'' were published by K. Kleve in 1989 and consist of sixteen fragments. These remnants were discovered among the Epicurean library in the [[Villa of the Papyri]], [[Herculaneum]]. Because, as W. H. D. Rouse notes, "the fragments are so minute and bear so few certainly identifiable letters", at this point in time "some scepticism about their proposed authorship seems pardonable and prudent."&lt;ref name=earlymanu/&gt; However, Kleve contends that four of the six books are represented in the fragments, which he argues is reason to assume that the entire poem was at one time kept in the library. If Lucretius's poem were to be definitely placed at the Villa of the Papyri, it would suggest that it was studied by the Neapolitan Epicurean school.&lt;ref name=earlymanu&gt;[[#Rouse|Rouse (1992) [1924]]], pp. liv{{en dash}}lv.&lt;/ref&gt;

Copies of the poem were preserved in a number of medieval libraries, with the earliest extant manuscripts dating from the ninth-century.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Butterfield|Butterfield (2013)]], pp. 6{{en dash}}13.&lt;/ref&gt; The oldest{{em dash}}and, according to David Butterfield, most famous{{em dash}}of these is the Codex Oblongus, often called O. This copy has been dated to the early ninth century and was produced by a [[Carolingian]] [[scriptorium]] (likely a monastery connected to the court of [[Charlemagne]]).&lt;ref name="o_68"&gt;[[#Butterfield|Butterfield (2013)]], pp. 6{{en dash}}8.&lt;/ref&gt; O is currently housed at [[Leiden University]].&lt;ref&gt;[[#Butterfield|Butterfield (2013)]], p. 8.&lt;/ref&gt; The second of these ninth-century manuscripts is the Codex Quadratus, often called Q. This manuscript was likely copied after O, sometime in the mid-ninth century.&lt;ref name="q_89"&gt;[[#Butterfield|Butterfield (2013)]], pp. 8{{en dash}}9.&lt;/ref&gt; Today, Q is also housed at Leiden University.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Butterfield|Butterfield (2013)]], p. 312.&lt;/ref&gt; The third and final ninth-century manuscript{{em dash}}which comprises the ''Schedae Gottorpienses'' fragment (commonly called G and located in the Kongelige Bibliotek of [[Copenhagen]]) and the ''Schedae Vindobonenses'' fragments (commonly called V and U and located in the [[Austrian National Library]] in [[Vienna]]){{em dash}}was christened by Butterfield as S and has been dated to the latter part of the ninth century.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Butterfield|Butterfield (2013)]], pp. 10{{en dash}}11.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[#Butterfield|Butterfield (2013)]], pp. 313{{en dash}}14.&lt;/ref&gt; Scholars consider manuscripts O, Q, and S to all be descendants of the original [[Archetype (textual criticism)|archetype]], which they dub Ω.&lt;ref name=b17&gt;[[#Butterfield|Butterfield (2013)]], p. 17.&lt;/ref&gt; However, while O is a direct descendant of the archetype,&lt;ref name=b17/&gt; Q and S are believed to have both been derived from a manuscript (Ψ) that in turn had been derived from a damaged and modified version of the archetype (Ω&lt;sup&gt;I&lt;/sup&gt;).&lt;ref&gt;[[#Butterfield|Butterfield (2013)]], pp. 15{{en dash}}16.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[#Butterfield|Butterfield (2013)]], pp. 18{{en dash}}19.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Rediscovery to the present===

[[File:Gianfrancesco Poggio Bracciolini - Imagines philologorum.jpg|thumb|right|alt=Engraving of Poggio Bracciolini in middle age|''De rerum natura'' was rediscovered by [[Poggio Bracciolini]] c.{{nbsp}}1416{{en dash}}1417.]]

While there exist a handful of references to Lucretius in Romance and Germanic sources dating between the ninth-and fifteenth centuries (references that, according to Ada Palmer, "indicate a tenacious, if spotty knowledge of the poet and some knowledge of [his] poem"), no manuscripts of ''De rerum natura'' currently survive from this span of time.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Palmer|Palmer (2014)]], p. 100.&lt;/ref&gt; Rather, all the remaining Lucertian manuscripts that are currently extant date from or after the fifteenth century.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Smith&amp;Rouse|Smith (1992) [1924]]], p. lvi.&lt;/ref&gt; This is because ''De rerum natura'' was rediscovered in January 1417 by [[Gian Francesco Poggio Bracciolini|Poggio Bracciolini]], who probably found the poem in the Benedictine library at [[Fulda]]. The manuscript that Poggio discovered did not survive, but a copy (the "Codex Laurentianus 35.30") of it by Poggio's friend, [[Niccolò de' Niccoli]], did, and today it is kept at the [[Laurentian Library]] in Florence.&lt;ref name=TNY /&gt;

[[Niccolò Machiavelli|Machiavelli]] made a copy early in his life. [[Molière]] produced a verse translation which does not survive; [[John Evelyn]] translated the first book.&lt;ref name=TNY /&gt;

The Italian scholar Guido Billanovich demonstrated that Lucretius's poem was well known in its entirety by [[Lovato Lovati]] (1241–1309) and some other Paduan pre-humanists during the thirteenth century.&lt;ref name="edu.lascuola.it" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[#Bil1958|Billanovich (1958)]].&lt;/ref&gt; This proves that the work was known in select circles long before the official rediscovery by Poggio.  It has been suggested that [[Dante]] (1265–1321) might have read Lucretius's poem, as a few verses of his ''[[Divine Comedy]]'' exhibit a great affinity with ''De rerum natura'', but there is no conclusive evidence that Dante ever read Lucretius.&lt;ref name="edu.lascuola.it"&gt;{{cite web|author=Piazzi, Francesco|year=2010|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151010172026/http://www.edu.lascuola.it/edizioni-digitali/Cappelli/HortusApertus/vol_1/Lucrezio/26_LAFORTUNA.pdf|archivedate=October 10, 2015|publisher=Editrice La Scuola |title=Hortus Apertus {{en dash}} La fortuna {{en dash}} Dante e Lucrezio | url=http://www.edu.lascuola.it/edizioni-digitali/Cappelli/HortusApertus/vol_1/Lucrezio/26_LAFORTUNA.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first printed edition of ''De rerum natura'' was produced in [[Brescia]], [[Lombardy]], in 1473. Other printed editions followed soon after. Additionally, although only published in 1996, [[Lucy Hutchinson|Lucy Hutchinson's]] translation of ''De rerum natura'' was in all likelihood the first in English and was most likely completed some time in the late 1640s or 1650s.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Goldberg|Goldberg (2006)]], p. 275.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reception==

===Classical antiquity===

{{multiple image| total_width = 400|image1=Cicero - Musei Capitolini.JPG|alt1=Bust of Cicero|image2=Publius_Vergilius_Maro1.jpg|alt2=Presumed marble bust of Virgil|footer=Many scholars believe that Lucretius and his poem were referenced or alluded to by [[Cicero]] (''left'') and [[Virgil]] (''right'').}}

The earliest recorded critique of Lucretius's work is in a letter written by the Roman statesman [[Cicero]] to his brother [[Quintus Tullius Cicero|Quintus]], in which the former claims that Lucretius's poetry is "full of inspired brilliance, but also of great artistry" (''Lucreti poemata, ut scribis, ita sunt, multis luminibus ingeni, multae tamen artis'').&lt;ref&gt;[[#Lucretius-Lee|Lucretius &amp; Lee (1893)]], p. xiii.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Cicero, ''[[Epistulae ad Quintum Fratrem]]'' 2.10.3.&lt;/ref&gt;

It is also believed that the Roman poet [[Virgil]] referenced Lucretius and his work in the second book of his ''[[Georgics]]'' when he wrote: "Happy is he who has discovered the causes of things and has cast beneath his feet all fears, unavoidable fate, and the din of the devouring Underworld" (''felix qui potuit rerum cognoscere causas''/''atque metus omnis et inexorabile fatum''/''subiecit pedibus strepitumque Acherontis avari'').&lt;ref name=lucretius_stanford/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Virgil, ''[[Georgics]]'' 2.490-492.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[#Smith&amp;Rouse|Smith (1992) [1924]]], p. xx.&lt;/ref&gt; According to David Sedley of the ''[[Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy]]'', "With these admiring words, Virgil neatly encapsulates four dominant themes of the poem{{em dash}}universal causal explanation, leading to elimination of the threats the world seems to pose, a vindication of free will, and disproof of the soul's survival after death."&lt;ref name=lucretius_stanford/&gt;

Lucretius was almost certainly read by the imperial poet [[Marcus Manilius]] (fl. 1st century AD), whose didactic poem ''[[Astronomica (Manilius)|Astronomica]]'' (written c. AD 10{{en dash}}20), alludes to ''De rerum natura'' in a number of places.&lt;ref name=volk192&gt;[[#Volk|Volk (2009)]], p. 192.&lt;/ref&gt; However, Manilius's poem, espouses a [[Stoicism|Stoic]], [[Determinism|deterministic]] understanding of the universe,&lt;ref&gt;[[#Volk|Volk (2009)]] (2009), p. 1.&lt;/ref&gt; and by its very nature attacks the very philosophical underpinnings of Lucretius's worldview.&lt;ref name=volk192/&gt; This has led scholars like Katharina Volk to argue that "Manilius is a veritable anti-Lucretius".&lt;ref name=volk192/&gt; What is more, Manilius also seems to suggest throughout this poem that his work is superior to that of Lucretius's.&lt;ref name=volk193&gt;[[#Volk|Volk (2009)]], p. 193.&lt;/ref&gt; (Coincidentally, ''De rerum natura'' and the ''Astronomica'' were both rediscovered by Poggio Bracciolini in the early 15th century.)&lt;ref&gt;[[#Britannica|"Gian Francesco Poggio Bracciolini" (2013)]].&lt;/ref&gt;

Additionally, Lucretius's work is discussed by the Augustan poet [[Ovid]], who in his ''Amores'' writes "the verses of the sublime Lucretius will perish only when a day will bring the end of the world" (''Carmina sublimis tunc sunt peritura Lucreti / exitio terras cum dabit una dies''),&lt;ref&gt;[[Ovid]], ''[[Amores (Ovid)|Amores]]'' 1.15.23{{en dash}}24.&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[Classical Latin#Authors of the Silver Age|Silver Age]] poet [[Statius]], who in his ''[[Silvae]]'' praises Lucretius as being highly "learned".&lt;ref name=bp50/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Statius, ''[[Silvae]]'' 2.7.76.&lt;/ref&gt; David Butterfield also writes that "clear echoes and/or responses" to ''De rerum natura'' can be detected in the works of the Roman [[Elegy|elegiac]] poets [[Catullus]], [[Propertius]], and [[Tibullus]], as well as the [[lyric poetry|lyric poet]] [[Horace]].&lt;ref&gt;[[#Butterfield|Butterfield (2013)]], pp. 47{{en dash}}48.&lt;/ref&gt;

In regards to prose writers, a number either quote from Lucretius's poem or express great admiration for ''De rerum natura'', including: [[Vitruvius]] (in ''De Architectura''),&lt;ref&gt;[[Vitruvius]], ''De Architectura'' 9.pr.17{{en dash}}18.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=butterfield49&gt;[[#Butterfield|Butterfield (2013)]], p. 49.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Marcus Velleius Paterculus]] (in the ''Historiae Romanae''),&lt;ref name=butterfield49/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Marcus Velleius Paterculus]], ''Historiae Romanae'' 2.36.2.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Quintilian]] (in the ''[[Institutio Oratoria]]''),&lt;ref name=bp50&gt;[[#Butterfield|Butterfield (2013)]], pp. 50{{en dash}}51.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Quintilian]], ''[[Institutio Oratoria]]'' 1.4.4; 3.1.4; 10.1.87; 12.11.27.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Tacitus]] (in the ''[[Dialogus de oratoribus]]''),&lt;ref name=bp50/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Tacitus]], ''[[Dialogus de oratoribus]]'' 23.1.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Marcus Cornelius Fronto]] (in ''De eloquentia''),&lt;ref&gt;[[#Butterfield|Butterfield (2013)]], pp. 52{{en dash}}53.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Marcus Cornelius Fronto]], ''De eloquentia'' 3.2.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Cornelius Nepos]] (in the ''Life Of Atticus''),&lt;ref name=butterfield49/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Cornelius Nepos]], ''Vitae'', "Atticus" 12.4.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Apuleius]] (in ''De Deo Socratis''),&lt;ref&gt;[[#Butterfield|Butterfield (2013)]], pp. 53{{en dash}}54.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Apuleius]], ''De Deo Socratis'' 1.7; 10.7.&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Gaius Julius Hyginus]] (in the ''Fabulae'').&lt;ref&gt;[[Gaius Julius Hyginus]], ''Fabulae'' 57, 151.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[#Butterfield|Butterfield (2013)]], p. 54.&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, [[Pliny the Elder]] lists Lucretius (presumably referring to his ''De rerum natura'') as a source at the beginning of his ''[[Natural History (Pliny)|Naturalis Historia]]'', and [[Seneca the Younger]] quoted six passages from ''De rerum natura'' across several of his works.&lt;ref&gt;[[Pliny the Elder]], ''[[Natural History (Pliny)|Naturalis Historia]]'' 1.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[#Butterfield|Butterfield (2013)]], pp. 49{{en dash}}50.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Late antiquity and the Middle Ages===

{{multiple image| total_width = 500|image1=Lactantius.jpg|alt1=A fresco of Lactantius|image2=Isidor von Sevilla.jpeg|alt2=A painting of Isidore sitting consulting a book|footer=Lucretius was quoted by several early Christian writers, including [[Lactantius]] (''left'') and [[Isidore of Seville]] (''right'').}}

Because Lucretius was critical of religion and the claim of an immortal soul, his poem was disparaged by most early [[Church Fathers]].&lt;ref name="Butterfield 2013 p. 56"&gt;[[#Butterfield|Butterfield (2013)]], p. 56.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Early Christian]] [[apologetics|apologist]] Lactantius, in particular, heavily cites and critiques Lucretius in his ''[[The Divine Institutes]]'' and its ''Epitome'', as well as his ''De ira Dei''.&lt;ref name="Butterfield 2013 p. 56"/&gt; While he argued that Lucretius's criticism of Roman religion were "sound attacks on paganism and superstition", Lactantius claimed that they were futile against the "True Faith" of Christianity.&lt;ref name=palmer125/&gt; Lactantius also disparages the science of ''De rerum natura'' (as well as of Epicureanism in general), calls Lucretius "the most worthless of the poets" (''poeta inanissimus''), notes that he is unable to read more than a few lines of ''De rerum natura'' without laughing, and sarcastically asks, "Who would think that [Lucretius] had a brain when he said these things?"&lt;ref name=palmer125&gt;[[#Palmer|Palmer (2014)]], p. 125.&lt;/ref&gt;

After Lactantius's time, Lucretius was almost exclusively referenced or alluded to in a negative manner by the [[Church Fathers]]. The one major exception to this was [[Isidore of Seville]], who at the start of the 7th century produced a work on astronomy and natural history dedicated to the Visigothic king [[Sisebut]] that was entitled ''De natura rerum''. In both this work, and as well as his more well-known ''[[Etymologiae]]'' (c. AD 600{{en dash}}625), Isidore liberally quotes from Lucretius a total of twelve times, drawing verses from all of Lucretius's books except his third.&lt;ref name=dronke&gt;[[#Dronke|Dronke (1984)]], p. 459.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[#Butterfield|Butterfield (2013)]], p. 89.&lt;/ref&gt; (Of note, about a century later, the British historian and Doctor of the Church [[Bede]] produced a work also called ''De natura rerum'', partly based on Isidore's work but apparently ignorant of Lucretius's poem.)&lt;ref&gt;[[#Kendall|Kendall &amp; Wallis (2010)]], p. 191.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Renaissance to the present===

[[Michel de Montaigne|Montaigne]] owned a Latin edition published in Paris, in 1563, by [[Denis Lambin]] which he heavily annotated.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Titi Lucretii Cari ''De rerum natura'' Libri Sex (Montaigne.1.4.4)|url=http://cudl.lib.cam.ac.uk/view/PR-MONTAIGNE-00001-00004-00004/1|publisher=[[Cambridge University]]|via=[[Cambridge Digital Library|The Cambridge Digital Library]]|accessdate=July 9, 2015|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160829134742/http://cudl.lib.cam.ac.uk/view/PR-MONTAIGNE-00001-00004-00004/1|archivedate=August 29, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; His ''[[Essays (Montaigne)|Essays]]'' contain almost a hundred quotes from ''De rerum natura''.&lt;ref name=TNY /&gt; Additionally, in his [[Essays (Montaigne)|essay]] "Of Books", he lists Lucretius along with Virgil, [[Horace]], and [[Catullus]] as his four top poets.&lt;ref&gt;[[Michel de Montaigne|Montaigne]], ''[[Essays (Montaigne)|Essays]]'', "Of Books".&lt;/ref&gt;

Notable figures who owned copies include [[Ben Jonson]] whose copy is held at the [[Houghton Library]], Harvard; and [[Thomas Jefferson]], who owned at least five Latin editions and English, Italian and French translations.&lt;ref name=TNY /&gt;

Lucretius has also had a marked influence upon modern philosophy, as perhaps the most complete expositor of Epicurean thought.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Gillespie|Gillespie &amp; MacKenzie (2007)]], p. 322.&lt;/ref&gt; His influence is especially notable in the work of the [[Spanish-American]] philosopher [[George Santayana]], who praised Lucretius{{em dash}}along with [[Dante]] and [[Goethe]]{{em dash}}in his book ''Three Philosophical Poets''.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Santayana|Santayana (1922) [1910]]], pp. 19–72.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2011, the historian and literary scholar [[Stephen Greenblatt]] wrote a [[popular history]] book about the poem, entitled ''[[The Swerve: How the World Became Modern]]''. In the work, Greenblatt argues that Poggio Bracciolini's discovery of ''De rerum natura'' reintroduced important ideas that sparked the [[Modernity|modern age]].&lt;ref name=TS&gt;{{Citation |url=https://www.pbs.org/newshour/bb/entertainment/jan-june12/swerve_05-25.html |title='The Swerve': When an Ancient Text Reaches Out and Touches Us |archivedate=May 26, 2012 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120526065810/https://www.pbs.org/newshour/bb/entertainment/jan-june12/swerve_05-25.html |date=May 25, 2012 |publisher=[[PBS]]|author=Brown, Jeffrey}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=AUTTCT&gt;[[#Garner|Garner (2011)]].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Br&gt;[[#Owchar|Owchar (2011)]].&lt;/ref&gt; The book was well-received, and later earned the 2012 [[Pulitzer Prize for General Non-Fiction]] and the 2011 [[National Book Award for Nonfiction]].&lt;ref name=T2PPWGN&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pulitzer.org/citation/2012-General-Nonfiction |title=The 2012 Pulitzer Prize Winners: General Nonfiction |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120509024435/http://www.pulitzer.org/citation/2012-General-Nonfiction|archivedate=May 9, 2012 |publisher=Columbia University}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nationalbook.org/nba2011_nf_greenblatt.html |title=2011 National Book Award Winner, Nonfiction |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120505020231/http://www.nationalbook.org/nba2011_nf_greenblatt.html|archivedate=May 5, 2012 |publisher=[[National Book Foundation]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Deep ecology''' is an [[ecology|ecological]] and [[environmental philosophy]] promoting the inherent worth of living beings regardless of their instrumental utility to human needs, plus a radical restructuring of modern human societies in accordance with such ideas. 

Deep ecology argues that the natural world is a subtle balance of complex inter-relationships in which the existence of organisms is dependent on the existence of others within [[ecosystem]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Ecosystems are also considered to be dependent on other ecosystems within the [[biosphere]].&lt;/ref&gt; Human interference with or destruction of the natural world poses a threat therefore not only to humans but to all organisms constituting the natural order.

Deep ecology's core principle is the belief that the living environment as a whole should be respected and regarded as having certain inalienable legal [[rights]] to live and flourish, independent of its instrumental benefits for human use. Deep ecology is often framed in terms of the idea of a much broader sociality; it recognizes diverse communities of life on Earth that are composed not only through biotic factors but also, where applicable, through ethical relations, that is, the valuing of other beings as more than just resources. It describes itself as "deep" because it regards itself as looking more deeply into the actual reality of humanity's relationship with the natural world arriving at philosophically more profound conclusions than that of the prevailing view of ecology as a branch of biology.&lt;ref name="Smith2014"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Smith |first=Mick |date=2014 |title=Deep Ecology: What is Said and (to be) Done? |url=http://trumpeter.athabascau.ca/index.php/trumpet/article/viewFile/1378/1660 |journal=The Trumpeter |volume=30 |issue=2 |pages=141–156 |issn=0832-6193 |access-date=12 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The movement does not subscribe to [[anthropocentrism|anthropocentric]] environmentalism (which is concerned with conservation of the environment only for exploitation by and for human purposes) since deep ecology is grounded in a quite different set of philosophical assumptions. Deep ecology takes a more [[holistic view]] of the world human beings live in and seeks to apply to life the understanding that the separate parts of the ecosystem (including humans) function as a whole. This philosophy provides a foundation for the [[environmental movement|environmental]], [[ecology movement|ecology]], and [[green movement]]s and has fostered a new system of [[environmental ethics]] advocating [[wilderness]] preservation, [[human population control]], and [[simple living]].&lt;ref name=barry&gt;{{cite book |title=International Encyclopedia of Environmental Politics|author=John Barry|author2=E. Gene Frankland|publisher=Routledge|year=2002|page=161|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=YTB4OMgsxIEC&amp;pg=PA161|isbn=9780415202855}}&lt;/ref&gt;
== Origins ==
In his original 1972/73 deep ecology paper, [[Arne Næss]] claims the deep ecology movement arose from scientists – ecologists – who were out in the field studying the biodiversity and wild ecosystems throughout the world. They were also doing the work of philosophers, laying the foundations for the Age of Ecology and a new ecological worldview to replace the anthropocentric, mastery of Nature, and modernist worldview arising in the 17th and 18th centuries. Three of the most influential ecological spokespersons of the 1960s were [[Rachel Carson]], [[David Brower]], and [[Paul R. Ehrlich]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Sessions |first=George |date=2014 |title=Deep Ecology, New Conservation, and the Anthropocene Worldview |url=http://trumpeter.athabascau.ca/index.php/trumpet/article/viewFile/1404/1658 |journal=The Trumpeter |volume=30 |issue=2 |pages=106–114 |issn=0832-6193 |access-date=12 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some consider the publication of Rachel Carson's book ''[[Silent Spring]]'' (1962) as the beginning of the contemporary, long-range deep ecology movement. When her book appeared there was a long-standing movement for conservation of land and resources, as well as support for creating parks and other areas devoted to preserving wilderness and spectacular nature. Carson's writings were especially influential because they clearly showed how human well-being depends on the condition of whole biotic communities. She explained in practical terms how living beings are interrelated within ecosystems. She explained how pesticides used to control mosquitoes and other insects led to declines in some bird populations. ''Silent Spring'' helped show how complex food webs and networks of biotic relationships function. Since humans are at the top of many food chains, exposure to chemicals becomes more concentrated as these move up the chains. The chemicals also can be stored in human tissues and gradually accumulate over time, adversely affecting health. Carson showed the need for deep changes in human practices and ways of living.

The 1960s was a decade of vigorous social [[activism]] in the United States, Canada, Western Europe, and Australia. Some activism focused on war and peace and the issue of nuclear weapons. A well-known early environmental organization started with a focus on nuclear tests and their environmental hazards. Some people in British Columbia, Canada, were opposed to the test of a nuclear weapon by the US government on Amchitka Island. They hired a fishing vessel and sailed towards the nuclear test site in protest. This action led to the founding of [[Greenpeace]], which became more identified with environmental issues as time went by. These great movements were further catalyzed by the now iconic images of the whole Earth floating in space taken during the return of the Apollo space missions from their journey to the moon. Among the astronauts that witnessed seeing the whole Earth firsthand was [[Edgar D. Mitchell]], who in 1971, during the return mission of Apollo 14, had an epiphany that what is needed to solve the eco-crisis "is a transformation of consciousness".&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite journal |first1=Alan |last1=Drengson |first2=Bill |last2=Devall |first3=Mark A. |last3=Schroll |date=2011 |title=The Deep Ecology Movement: Origins, Development, and Future Prospects (Toward a Transpersonal Ecosophy) |journal=International Journal of Transpersonal Studies |volume=30 |issue=1–2 |pages=101–117 |doi=10.24972/ijts.2011.30.1-2.101 |doi-access=free}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Principles ==

Proponents of deep ecology believe that the world does not exist as a [[natural resource|resource]] to be freely [[Exploitation of natural resources|exploited]] by humans. If material goods do not guarantee happiness beyond a very moderate level, and over-consumption is endangering the biosphere, defining a new non-consumptive paradigm of well-being seems primordial, such a paradigm would be non-acquisitive/non-consumerist and non-hierarchical in relation to our place on Earth.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Anderson|first1=Tom|last2=Guyas|first2=Anniina Suominen|title=Earth Education, Interbeing, and Deep Ecology|journal=Studies in Art Education|volume=53|issue=3|year=2015|pages=223–245|issn=0039-3541|doi=10.1080/00393541.2012.11518865}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ethics of deep ecology hold that the survival of any part is dependent upon the well-being of the whole. Proponents of deep ecology offer an eight-tier platform to elucidate their claims:

{{quotation|
*The well-being and flourishing of human and nonhuman life on Earth have value in themselves. These values are independent of the usefulness of the nonhuman world for human purposes.
*Richness and [[diversity of life]] forms contribute to the realization of these values and are also values in themselves
*Humans have no right to reduce this richness and diversity except to satisfy vital human needs
*The flourishing of human life and cultures is compatible with a substantial decrease of the [[human population]]. The flourishing of nonhuman life requires such a decrease.
*Present human interference with the nonhuman world is excessive, and the situation is rapidly worsening
*Policies must therefore be changed. These policies affect basic economic, technological, and ideological structures. The resulting state of affairs will be deeply different from the present.
*The ideological change is mainly that of appreciating [[life quality]] (dwelling in situations of inherent value) rather than adhering to an increasingly higher standard of living. There will be a profound awareness of the difference between ''big'' and ''great''.
*Those who subscribe to the foregoing points have an obligation directly or indirectly to try to implement the necessary changes.

==Development==
The phrase "deep ecology" was coined by the Norwegian philosopher [[Arne Næss]] in 1973.&lt;ref name="Naess1973"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Næss|first1=Arne|title=The shallow and the deep, long‐range ecology movement. A summary|journal=Inquiry|volume=16|issue=1–4|year=1973|pages=95–100|issn=0020-174X|doi=10.1080/00201747308601682|url=http://wildsreprisal.com/PDF's/Cascadia%20Rising/The%20shallow%20and%20the%20deep,%20long-range%20ecology%20movement.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Næss rejected the idea that beings can be ranked according to their relative value. For example, judgments on whether an animal has an eternal [[soul]], whether it uses [[reason]] or whether it has [[consciousness]] (or indeed [[higher consciousness]]) have all been used to justify the ranking of the [[human|human animal]] as superior to other animals. Næss states that from an ecological point of view "the right of all forms [of life] to live is a universal right which cannot be quantified. No single species of living being has more of this particular right to live and unfold than any other species."{{fact|date=November 2018}}

This [[metaphysics|metaphysical]] idea is elucidated in [[Warwick Fox]]'s claim that humanity and all other beings are "aspects of a single unfolding reality".&lt;ref&gt;Fox, Warwick, (1990) ''Towards a Transpersonal Ecology'' (Shambhala Books)&lt;/ref&gt;  As such deep ecology would support the view of [[Aldo Leopold]] in his book  ''[[A Sand County Almanac]]'' that humans are "plain members of the biotic community". They also would support [[Land ethic#Aldo Leopold's land ethic|Leopold's land ethic]]: "a thing is right when it tends to preserve the integrity, stability and beauty of the [[biocoenosis|biotic community]]. It is wrong when it tends otherwise."  Daniel Quinn, in his novel ''[[Ishmael (novel)|Ishmael]]'', showed that an anthropocentric myth underlies our current view of the world.&lt;ref&gt;Quinn, Daniel (1995), "Ishmael: An Adventure of the Mind and Spirit" (Bantam)&lt;/ref&gt;

The ecological problems faced by the world today are partly due to the loss of traditional knowledge, values, and ethics of behavior that celebrate the intrinsic value and sacredness of the natural world and that give the preservation of Nature prime importance. Correspondingly, the assumption of human superiority to other life forms, as if we were granted royalty status over Nature - the idea that Nature is mainly here to serve human will and purpose - receives a radical critique in deep ecology.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Deep ecology developed a response to the anthropocentric view and several different actors played an important historical role in its development. Prominent among them was [[Joseph W. Meeker]], who in 1973 told [[George Sessions]] about Arne Næss, whom Meeker knew personally.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Jacob|first=Merle|title=Sustainable development and deep ecology: An analysis of competing traditions|journal=Environmental Management|language=en|volume=18|issue=4|pages=477–488|doi=10.1007/BF02400853|issn=0364-152X|year=1994}}&lt;/ref&gt; As Warwick Fox related, "One of the things that initially interested Sessions about Næss was Næss's strong interest in, and innovative approach to, the work of Spinoza. Sessions says that he had himself 'arrived at Spinoza as the answer to the process of teaching history of philosophy by about 1972 and independently of being in contact with Næss.'"{{citation needed|date=November 2016}} Sessions therefore wrote to Næss at this time, beginning a lifelong association. Meeker's (1972, 1997) book ''The Comedy of Survival: Studies in Literary Ecology'' emerged through the work of scholars seeking an environmental ethic. That book represents Meeker's founding work in literary ecology and [[ecocriticism]], which demonstrates the relationship between the literary arts and scientific ecology, especially humankind's consideration of comedy and tragedy. It reminds readers that adaptive behaviors (comedy) promote survival, whereas tragedy estranges from other life forms. This thesis rests on Meeker's study of comparative literature, his work with biologist [[Konrad Lorenz]], and his work as a field ecologist in the National Park service in Alaska, Oregon, and California.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Deep ecology offers a philosophical basis for environmental advocacy which may, in turn, guide human activity against perceived self-destruction. Deep ecology and [[environmentalism]] hold that the science of ecology [[History of ecology|shows]] that [[ecosystem]]s can absorb only limited change by humans or other dissonant influences. Further, both hold that the actions of modern civilization threaten global ecological well-being. Ecologists have described change and stability in ecological systems in various ways, including [[homeostasis]], [[dynamic equilibrium]], and "flux of nature".&lt;ref&gt;Botkin, Daniel B. (1990). ''Discordant Harmonies: A New Ecology for the Twenty-First Century.'' Oxford Univ. Press, NY, NY. {{ISBN|0-19-507469-6}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Regardless of which model is most accurate, [[environmentalism|environmentalists]] {{Citation needed|date=October 2007}} contend that massive human economic activity has pushed the [[biosphere]] far from its "natural" state through reduction of [[biodiversity#Ecological role of biodiversity|biodiversity]], [[climate change]], and other influences. As a consequence, civilization is causing [[Extinction event|mass extinction]] at a rate between 100 species a day and possibly 140,000 species a year, which is 10,000 times the background rate of extinction. Deep ecologists hope to influence social and political change through their philosophy. Næss has proposed, as [[Nicholas Goodrick-Clarke]] writes, "that the earth’s human population should be reduced to about 100 million."&lt;ref name="Goodrick-Clarke1998"/&gt;

== Environmental education ==
Ecology in the narrow sense refers to the biological science of [[ecology]]. However, ecological paradigms and principles are being developed and applied in almost all disciplines, and these paradigms have to do with the way we approach understanding the relationships and inter-connections within and between living beings which give to each its special place and identity. Human ecology, e.g., must certainly take account of the role of our subjective lives and spiritual needs, as well as our biological ones, in terms of their ecological effects. Ecology in this sense is not a reductionist undertaking, but a movement toward a more whole (or holistic) vision and understanding of world processes.&lt;ref name="Smith2014" /&gt; Deep ecology seeks to look into all levels of existence and might be viewed as radical by some; for them a more anthropocentric view is appropriate because it put humans at the center. Learning how to live in harmony with our surroundings is beneficial because stopping the global extinction crisis and achieving true ecological sustainability will require rethinking our values as a society. In that way education seems to be the best way to start. Sustainability education aims to help learners understand their interconnectedness with all life, to become creative problem solvers and active citizens, and to engage personally and intellectually in shaping our common future. Experiential learning and critical pedagogy are central to providing opportunities for learners to engage in transformative sustainability learning. The “Environment” broadly defined, remains somewhat neglected within development studies, despite a substantial increase in contributions to the field over the fifteen years since 2000. Undergraduate and postgraduate courses (with some notable exceptions) often “add on” environmental issues as special lectures or modules, and there remains a tendency for those who are grounded in the material and discursive struggles that define the discipline to consider the environment as an exotic special interest, a problem that manifests itself in societies that have the leisure to care about the natural world. Development of a modern education model promoting patriotism and civic responsibility, active social position and healthy lifestyle is closely linked to the development of environmental responsibility in the younger generation. Development of environmentally responsible personality in individual is of particular importance for graduates of educational institutions. Environmental education could be integrated in different curriculum in most fields: education for sustainable development in the context of ecopedagogy.

Ecopedagogy calls for the remaking of capitalist practices and seeks to re-engage democracy to include multispecies interests in the face of our current global ecological crisis. It does so by using different ideas that challenge the way we see education.  In Critical Pedagogy, Ecoliteracy and Planetary Crisis: The Ecopedagogy Movement, Richard Kahn (2010) reformulates Herbert Marcuse’s critical theories of society, and supports the kind of education that seizes the power of radical environmental activists and supports the earth democracy in which multispecies interests are represented. The destruction of habitats and threats to biodiversity resulting from expansion of human population and consumption is rarely addressed in a way that confronts students with the necessity to consider moral implications of such destruction.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Kopnina|first=Helen|date=2015-03-01|title=If a Tree Falls and Everybody Hears the Sound: Teaching Deep Ecology to Business Students|url=http://jsd.sagepub.com/content/9/1/101|journal=Journal of Education for Sustainable Development|language=en|volume=9|issue=1|pages=101–116|doi=10.1177/0973408215569119|issn=0973-4082}}&lt;/ref&gt; Pedagogically, a return to education associated with significant life experiences, such as hiking in wilderness areas as a youth; as well as strategically significant education, action competence, social learning, and variations and combinations of those and many other pedagogical approaches developed in the past 40 years. Some of these pedagogical approaches have been disputed—for example, the belief that experiencing environment first hand is an essential component of engaging people in conservation has been disputed by arguments that these education efforts have been informed by behaviorist socio-psychology models that assumed a linear causality between education experience and pro-environmental behavior.&lt;ref name="Misiaszek2015"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Misiaszek|first1=Greg William|title=Ecopedagogy and Citizenship in the Age of Globalisation: connections between environmental and global citizenship education to save the planet|journal=European Journal of Education|volume=50|issue=3|year=2015|pages=280–292|issn=01418211|doi=10.1111/ejed.12138}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Rather, the critics have argued that people’s environmental behaviors are too complex and contextually dependent to be captured by a simple casual model. The process of environmental education of schoolchildren has the following methodological characteristics:

* Goal-setting as the projected results reflects a model of environmentally responsible personality, taking into account trends in the development of key elements of education system; all natural sciences are involved in the development of basic ecological concepts.

* The introduction of interactive training methods takes place at the high school level in teaching self-reflection, hypothesizing, predicting; school natural science education is rebuilt on the basis of system approach in accordance with the planned ecologization results. Implementation of relevant methodology will promote successful development of environmentally responsible personality in high school graduates.&lt;ref name="Misiaszek2015" /&gt;

In higher education, the analysis of students’ individual writing assignments after viewing films/documentaries presents an interesting case of using radical ‘messages’ within the aims of environmental education in order to trigger both student’s engagement and critical thinking. The case study “If a Tree Falls and Everybody Hears the Sound” provides an example of how environmental advocacy and the objective of pluralistic education can be combined as mutually supportive means of achieving both democratic learning in which students’ individual opinions are seen as extremely valuable, and simultaneously provide an example of the type of ecopedagogy that supports learning for environmental sustainability. The role of environmental advocacy can be crucially important if the interests of all planetary citizens—and not just one species—are to be taken seriously.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

In her book ''Wild Children — Domesticated Dreams: Civilization and the Birth of Education'', [[Layla AbdelRahim]] argues that the current institutions responsible for the construction and transmission of civilized epistemology are driven by the destructive premises at the foundation of civilization and human predatory culture.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Wild children--domesticated dreams : civilization and the birth of education|last=Layla.|first=AbdelRahim|date=2013|publisher=Fernwood Pub|isbn=9781552665480|location=Winnipeg|oclc=829422058}}&lt;/ref&gt; In order to return to a viable socio-environmental culture, AbdelRahim calls for the rewilding of our anthropology (i.e. our place among other species) and of pedagogical culture, which in civilization is based on the same domestication methods of other animals.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Children's literature, domestication, and social foundation : narratives of civilization and wilderness|last=1964-|first=AbdelRahim, Layla|isbn=9780415661102|location=New York|oclc=897810261}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Næss and Fox do not claim to use [[logic]] or [[Inductive reasoning|induction]] to derive the philosophy directly from scientific ecology&lt;ref name="Naess1973" /&gt; but rather hold that scientific ecology directly implies the metaphysics of deep ecology, including its ideas about the self and further, that deep ecology finds scientific underpinnings in the fields of [[ecology]] and [[system dynamics]].

In their 1985 book ''Deep Ecology'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bill Devall and George Sessions describe a series of sources of deep ecology.  They include the science of ecology itself, and cite its major contribution as the rediscovery in a modern context that "everything is connected to everything else."  They point out that some ecologists and natural historians, in addition to their scientific viewpoint, have developed a deep ecological consciousness—for some a [[political consciousness]] and at times a [[spiritual consciousness]].  This is a perspective beyond the strictly human viewpoint, beyond [[anthropocentrism]].  Among the scientists they mention specifically are [[Rachel Carson]], [[Aldo Leopold]], [[John Livingston (naturalist)|John Livingston]], [[Paul R. Ehrlich]] and [[Barry Commoner]], together with [[Frank Fraser Darling]], [[Charles Sutherland Elton]], [[Eugene Odum]] and [[Paul Sears]].

A further scientific source for deep ecology adduced by Devall and Sessions is the "new physics", which they describe as shattering [[René Descartes|Descartes]]'s and [[Isaac Newton|Newton]]'s vision of the universe as a machine explainable in terms of simple [[linear]] cause and effect. They propose that Nature is in a state of constant flux and reject the idea of observers as existing independent of their environment.  They refer to [[Fritjof Capra]]'s ''[[The Tao of Physics]]'' and ''[[The Turning Point (book)|The Turning Point]]'' for their characterisation of how the new physics leads to metaphysical and ecological views of interrelatedness, which, according to Capra, should make deep ecology a framework for future human societies. Devall and Sessions also credit the American poet and social critic [[Gary Snyder]]—with his devotion to [[Buddhism]], [[Native Americans in the United States|Native American]] studies, the outdoors, and alternative social movements—as a major voice of wisdom in the evolution of their ideas.

The [[Gaia hypothesis]] was also an influence on the deep ecology movement.&lt;ref&gt;David Landis Barnhill, Roger S. Gottlieb (eds.), ''Deep Ecology and World Religions: New Essays on Sacred Ground'', SUNY Press, 2010, p. 32.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Spiritual===
The central spiritual tenet of deep ecology is that the human species is a part of the Earth, not separate from it, and as such human existence is dependent on the diverse organisms within the natural world each playing a role in the natural economy of the biosphere. Coming to an awareness of this reality involves a transformation of an outlook that presupposes humanity's superiority over the natural world. This self-realisation or "re-earthing"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Deep Ecology &amp; re-earthing ~ Q&amp;A|url=http://www.users.on.net/~arachne/deepeco.html|work=users.on.net/~arachne/index.html|accessdate=9 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; is used for an individual to intuitively gain an ecocentric perspective. The notion is based on the idea that the more we ''expand the self'' to identify with "others" (people, animals, ecosystems), the more we realize ourselves.  [[Transpersonal psychology]] has been used by [[Warwick Fox]] to support this idea.  Deep ecology has influenced the development of contemporary [[ecospirituality]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Aburrow|first=Yvonne|title=Eco-spirituality and theology|url=http://www.patheos.com/blogs/sermonsfromthemound/2013/01/eco-spirituality-and-theology/|work=Sermons from the Mound|publisher=Patheos|accessdate=7 January 2014|date=2013-01-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A number of spiritual and philosophical traditions including [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Native American]], Buddhist and [[Jainism|Jain]] are drawn upon in a continuing critique of the philosophical assumptions of the modern European mind which has enabled and led to what is seen as an increasingly unsustainable level of disregard towards the rights and needs of the natural world and its ability to continue to support human life. In relation to the [[Judeo-Christian]] tradition, Næss offers the following criticism: "The arrogance of stewardship [as found in the [[Bible]]] consists in the idea of superiority which underlies the thought that we exist to watch over nature like a highly respected middleman between the [[God|Creator]] and Creation."&lt;ref&gt;Næss, Arne. (1989). ''Ecology, Community and Lifestyle: Outline of an Ecosophy''. p. 187. {{ISBN|0-521-34873-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This theme had been expounded in [[Lynn Townsend White, Jr.]]'s 1967 article "The Historical Roots of Our Ecological Crisis",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

Næss' further criticizes the reformation's view of creation as property to be put into maximum productive use: a view used frequently in the past to exploit and dispossess native populations.  Many Protestant sects today regard the Bible's call for man to have stewardship of the earth as a call for the care for creation, rather than for exploitation.

The original Christian teachings on property support the Franciscan/stewardship interpretation of the Bible. Against this view, Martin Luther condemned church ownership of lands because "they did not want to use that property in an economically productive fashion. At best they used it to produce prayers. Luther, and other Reformation leaders insisted that it should be used, not to relieve men from the necessity of working, but as a tool for making more goods. The attitude of the Reformation was practically, "not prayers, but production." And production, not for consumption, but for more production." This justification was offered to support secular takings of church endowments and properties.&lt;ref&gt;Schlatter, Richard (1951). Private Property: the History of an Idea. (Rutgers Press)&lt;/ref&gt;

Anthropologist [[Layla AbdelRahim]] sees the root of the anthropogenic degradation of the biosphere in the anthropology that constructs the human animal as the supreme predator. The ontological explanation offered for Human Supremacy by both science and religion, she says, alienate the human being from the community of life and allow for an immoral control and destruction of the wilderness, which, according to her contains the spirit and intelligence of life.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;

=== Philosophical roots ===

==== Spinoza ====
[[Arne Næss]], who first wrote about the idea of deep ecology, from the early days of developing this outlook conceived [[Baruch Spinoza]] as a philosophical source.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Naess | first1 = A. | doi = 10.1007/BF02379991 | title = Spinoza and ecology | journal = Philosophia | volume = 7 | pages = 45–54 | year = 1977 | pmid =  | pmc = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Others have followed Næss' inquiry, including Eccy de Jonge, in ''Spinoza and Deep Ecology: Challenging Traditional Approaches to Environmentalism'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=de Jonge |first=Eccy |date=April 28, 2004 |title=Spinoza and Deep Ecology: Challenging Traditional Approaches to Environmentalism (Ashgate New Critical Thinking in Philosophy)  |url= |location= |publisher=Routledge |page= |isbn=978-0754633273}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Brenden MacDonald, in ''Spinoza, Deep Ecology, and Human Diversity—Realization of Eco-Literacies''&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=MacDonald|first=Brenden James|date=2012-05-14|title=Spinoza, Deep Ecology, and Human Diversity -- Schizophrenics and Others Who Could Heal the Earth If Society Realized Eco-Literacy|url=http://trumpeter.athabascau.ca/index.php/trumpet/article/view/1229|journal=Trumpeter|language=en|volume=28|issue=1|pages=89–101|issn=1705-9429}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{citation needed|date=April 2015}}&lt;!--http://www.environment-ecology.com/deep-ecology/63-deep-ecology.html mentions it --&gt;.

One of the topical centres of inquiry connecting Spinoza to Deep Ecology is "self-realization."  See Arne Næss in ''The Shallow and the Deep, Long-Range Ecology movement'' and ''Spinoza and the Deep Ecology Movement'' for discussion on the role of Spinoza's conception of self-realization and its link to deep ecology.

==Criticism, debate, and response==

===Knowledge of non-human interests===
Animal rights activists state that for an entity to require rights and protection [[intrinsic and extrinsic properties|intrinsically]], it must have interests.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Deep ecology is criticised for assuming that living things such as plants, for example, have their own interests as they are manifested by the plant's behavior—for instance, self-preservation being considered an expression of a will to live. Deep ecologists claim to ''identify'' with non-human nature, and in doing so, deny those who claim that non-human (or non-sentient) lifeforms' needs or interests are nonexistent or unknowable. The criticism is that the interests that a deep ecologist attributes to non-human organisms such as survival, reproduction, growth, and prosperity are really human interests. This is sometimes construed as a [[pathetic fallacy]] or [[anthropomorphism]], in which "the earth is endowed with 'wisdom', wilderness equates with 'freedom', and life forms are said to emit 'moral' qualities."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

==="Deepness"===
Deep ecology is criticised for its claim to being ''deeper'' than alternative theories, which by implication are ''shallow''. When [[Arne Næss]] coined the term ''deep ecology'', he compared it favourably with ''shallow environmentalism'' which he criticized for its [[utilitarian]] and [[anthropocentric]] attitude to nature and for its [[economic materialism|materialist]] and [[consumerism|consumer-oriented]] outlook.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web
| author=Great River Earth Institute
| url=http://www.greatriv.org/de.htm
| title=Deep Ecology: Environmentalism as if all beings mattered
| accessdate=2006-04-25
}}&lt;/ref&gt; Against this is [[Arne Næss]]'s own view that the "depth" of deep ecology resides in the persistence of its penetrative questioning, particularly in asking "Why?" when faced with initial answers.

Writer William D. Grey believes that developing a non-anthropocentric set of values is "a hopeless quest". He seeks an improved "shallow" view, writing, "What's wrong with shallow views is not their concern about the well-being of humans, but that they do not really consider enough in what that well-being consists. We need to develop an enriched, fortified anthropocentric notion of human interest to replace the dominant short-term, sectional and self-regarding conception."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.uq.edu.au/~pdwgrey/pubs/anthropocentrism.html Anthropocentrism and Deep Ecology by William Grey]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Bookchin's criticisms===
Some critics, particularly [[Social ecology (theory)|social ecologist]] [[Murray Bookchin]], have interpreted deep ecology as being [[misanthropic|hateful toward humanity]], due in part to the characterization of humanity by some deep ecologists, such as [[David Foreman]] of [[Earth First!]], as a pathological infestation on the Earth.&lt;ref name="Goodrick-Clarke1998"&gt;[[Nicholas Goodrick-Clarke]] (1998). ''[[Hitler's Priestess]]: Savitri Devi, the Hindu-Aryan Myth, and Neo-Nazism''. NY: New York University Press, {{ISBN|0-8147-3110-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bookchin&lt;ref name="Bookchin 1987"&gt;{{cite web

therefore asserts that "deep ecology, formulated largely by privileged male white academics, has managed to bring sincere naturalists like Paul Shepard into the same company as patently antihumanist and macho mountain men like David Foreman who preach a gospel that humanity is some kind of cancer in the world of life."&lt;ref name="Bookchin 1987"/&gt; Bookchin mentions that some, like Foreman, defend seemingly anti-human measures, such as severe population control and the claim regarding the Third World that "the best thing would be to just let nature seek its own balance, to let the people there just starve".&lt;ref name="Bookchin 1987"/&gt; However, Bookchin himself later admitted that "statements made by Earth First! activists are not to be confused with those made by deep ecology theorists".&lt;ref name="Zimmerman 1993"&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ecophilosopher [[Warwick Fox]] similarly "warns critics not to commit the fallacy of 'misplaced misanthropy.' That is, just because deep ecology criticizes an arrogant anthropocentrism does ''not'' mean that deep ecology is misanthropic."&lt;ref name="Zimmerman 1993"/&gt; Likewise, ''The Deep Ecology Movement: An Introductory Anthology'' attempts to clarify that "deep ecologists have been the strongest critics of [[anthropocentrism]], so much so that they have often been accused of a mean-spirited misanthropy"; however, "deep ecology is actually vitally concerned with humans realizing their best potential" and "is explicit in offering a vision of an alternative way of living that is joyous and enlivening."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Deep Ecology Movement|publisher=North Atlantic Books|location=Berkeley, CA|year=1995|editor=Alan Drengson and Yuichi Inoue|page=262|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=5M4SwWkKLZ4C&amp;printsec=onepage&amp;q=262|isbn=9781556431982}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Bookchin's second major criticism is that deep ecology fails to link environmental crises with [[authoritarianism]] and [[hierarchy]]. Social ecologists like him believe that environmental problems are firmly rooted in the manner of human social interaction, and suggest that deep ecologists fail to recognise the potential for human beings to solve environmental issues through a change of cultural attitudes. According to Bookchin, it is a social reconstruction alone that "can spare the biosphere from virtual destruction."&lt;ref name="Bookchin 1987"/&gt; Though some deep ecologists may reject the argument that ecological behavior is rooted in the social paradigm (which, according to their view, would be an anthropocentric fallacy), others in fact embrace this argument, such as the adherents to the deep ecologist movement [[Deep Green Resistance]].

}}&lt;/ref&gt; has likened deep ecology to its antithesis, the [[wise use]] movement, when he says that they both "misunderstand scientific information and then arrive at conclusions based on their misunderstanding, which are in turn used as justification for their ideologies. Both begin with an ideology and are political and social in focus." Elsewhere, though, he asserts that deep ecology must be taken seriously in the debate about the relationship between humans and nature because it challenges the fundamental assumptions of [[Western philosophy]]. Botkin has also criticized Næss's restatement and reliance upon the balance of nature idea and the perceived contradiction between his argument that all species are morally equal and his disparaging description of [[pioneering species]].

=== Response ===
Some writers have misunderstood Næss, taking his ecosophy T, with its self-realization norm, as something meant to characterize the whole deep ecology movement as part of a single philosophy called "deep ecology". Næss was not doing either of these. He emphasized that movements cannot be precisely defined, but only roughly characterized by very general statements. They are often united internationally by means of such principles as found in the United Nations (UN) Earth Charter (1980), and in UN documents about basic human rights. Næss was doing something more subtle than many thought. He was not putting forth a single worldview and philosophy of life that everyone should adhere to in support of the international ecology movement. Instead, he was making an empirical claim based on overwhelming evidence that global social movements, from the grass roots up, consist of people with very diverse religious, philosophical, cultural, and personal orientations. Nonetheless, they can agree on certain courses of action and certain broad principles, especially at the international level. As supporters of a given movement, they can treat one another with mutual respect. Because of these misunderstandings Næss introduced an apron diagram to clearly illustrate his subtle distinctions.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The apron diagram is meant to illustrate logical, as distinct from genetic, relations between views and their connection with social movements, policies and practical actions. By "logical relations" this means verbally articulated relations between the premises and conclusions.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; There is collective cooperation on global concerns, and yet a great variety of ultimate premises from which each person or group acts locally. Within global movements there is diversity at the local level because each place and community is different and must adapt to its unique setting. Thus, Næss stressed that his ecosophy T is not meant to hold for everyone, since it is tailored to his very modest lifestyle suitable to a place such as Tvergastein. The ultimate premises for his whole view might be conceptually incompatible with those in someone else's whole views. But even if this is true, they could both support the platform principles of the deep ecology movement and other social-political global movements, such as for peace and social justice. In recognizing the principle that all living beings have intrinsic worth, there is an acknowledgement that they are good for their own sake. This does not mean committing to biocentric equality or egalitarianism between species. Within the vast diversity of living beings, there are complex relationships the range of which is predation, competition, cooperation, and symbiosis. Many think that symbiosis and complementarity are important values to embrace as they are consistent with global cooperation, community life, and support for the deep ecology movement platform.

==Ecofeminist response==
Ecofeminism and deep ecology have been in dialogue for some time now, and while the debate between them has been very fruitful over the years, the exploration of their relationship remains important. As valuable as our individually reconnecting with the natural world may be, and as much as such experiences should be encouraged, [[weasel words|some]] have questioned whether this approach is sufficient, given the magnitude of the threat that human encroachment poses to the nonhuman world. With this in mind, the call has been made for a broader challenge to the dominant culture than deep ecological experience may offer. This call has come most forcefully from another school of environmental ethics: ecofeminism. While sharing with deep ecologists a general concern for biocentrism and an appreciation for personal interaction with nonhuman reality, ecofeminists have also offered some harsh criticism of Leopold, Callicott, and advocates of the deep ecological approach, as well as extensionists like Singer and Regan.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Diehm |first=Christian |date=2003 |title=The Self of Stars and Stone: Ecofeminism, Deep Ecology, and the Ecological Self |url=http://trumpeter.athabascau.ca/index.php/trumpet/article/viewFile/79/79 |journal=The Trumpeter |volume=16 |issue=3 |pages=31–45 |access-date=12 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Like deep ecology, ecofeminism is not a singular theory, and covers a broad range of thought; in rough terms, its criticism of other forms of nature ethics is grounded in an attempt to synthesize the insights of environmental ethics and animal advocacy with a feminist analysis of Western ethics and culture.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Booth |first=Annie |date=2000 |title=Ways of Knowing: Acceptable Understandings Within Bioregionalism, Deep Ecology, Ecofeminism, and Native American Cultures |url=http://trumpeter.athabascau.ca/index.php/trumpet/article/viewFile/145/170 |journal=The Trumpeter |volume=16 |issue=1 |access-date=12 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The resulting attempt to rethink our relationship to the animal and nature casts speciesism and anthropocentrism as symptoms of a deeper patriarchy in the Western tradition that needs to be deconstructed before a successful animal ethic can be produced. As Josephine Donovan details, there is evidence to suggest a strong emotional and philosophical affinity among Anglo-American antivivisectionists and suffragettes, who viewed their causes as common responses to Enlightenment rationalism and scientism, and jointly sought a “feminizing” of culture that would liberate human and animal alike.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; Ecological feminism began as a critique and rejection of the western cultural worldview with its overemphasis on rationality, and linearity.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Fellenz|first=Marc R.|title=The Moral Menagerie|url=http://muse.jhu.edu/chapter/611905|language=English|isbn=9780252091186|publisher=University of Illinois Press|year=2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; It argued against a Cartesian science which elevated the material and objective above the spiritual and the subjective as appropriate ways of knowing the world. Like deep ecology, ecological feminism stresses the importance of experience, and personal experience at that. However, the ecofeminists seem to be talking about experience in a sense more related to bioregionalism than deep ecology.

Both [[ecofeminism]] and deep ecology put forward a new conceptualization of the self. Some ecofeminists, such as [[Marti Kheel]],&lt;ref&gt;Kheel, Marti. (1990): ''Ecofeminism and Deep Ecology; reflections on identity and difference'' from: Diamond, Irene. Orenstein. Gloria (editors), ''Reweaving the World; The emergence of ecofeminism''. Sierra Club Books. San Francisco. pp 128-137. {{ISBN|0-87156-623-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; argue that self-realization and identification with all nature places too much emphasis on the whole, at the expense of the independent being. Similarly, some ecofeminists place more emphasis on the problem of [[androcentrism]] rather than [[anthropocentrism]]. To others, like [[Karen J. Warren]], the domination of women is tethered conceptually and historically to the domination of nature. Ecofeminism denies abstract [[individualism]] and embraces the interconnectedness of the living world; relationships, including our relationship with non-human nature, are not extrinsic to our identity and are essential in defining what it means to be human. Warren argues that hierarchical classifications in general, such as [[racism]] or [[speciesism]], are all forms of [[discrimination]] and are no different from [[sexism]]. Thus, [[anthropocentrism]] is simply another form of discrimination as a result of our flawed [[value system|value structure]] and should be abolished.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Warren|first=Karen J.|authorlink=Karen J. Warren|chapter=The Power and the Promise of Ecological Feminism|edition=5th|editor1-last=Pojman|editor1-first=Louis P.|editor1-link=Louis Pojman|editor2-last=Pojman|editor2-first=Paul|title=Environmental Ethics: Readings in Theory and Application|year=2008|publisher=Thomson Wadsworth|location=Belmont, CA|pages=33–48|isbn=978-0-495-09503-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Experiential deep ecologist [[Joanna Macy]] has attempted to avoid these conflicts and criticisms through her [[Work that Reconnects]].  By focussing deep ecology on the experience of the consciousness of personal depth within the participant, she speaks of "the greening of the self", which is part of the epochal journey of our times from an [[Id, ego and super-ego#Ego|ego]]ic or [[egotistical]] self to an ecological self.

==Links with other philosophies==
Parallels have been drawn between deep ecology and other philosophies, in particular those of the [[animal rights]] movement, [[Earth First!]], [[Deep Green Resistance]], and [[anarcho-primitivism]].

[[Peter Singer]]'s 1975 book ''[[Animal Liberation (book)|Animal Liberation]]'' critiqued anthropocentrism and put the case for animals to be given moral consideration. This can be seen as a part of a process of expanding the prevailing system of ethics to wider groupings. However, Singer has disagreed with deep ecology's belief in the intrinsic value of nature separate from questions of suffering, taking a more utilitarian stance.&lt;ref&gt;Kendall, Gillian (May 2011 ). [http://www.thesunmagazine.org/issues/425/the_greater_good The Greater Good: Peter Singer On How To Live An Ethical Life]. ''Sun Magazine'', The Sun Interview, Issue 425. Retrieved on: 2011-12-02&lt;/ref&gt; The [[feminism|feminist]] and [[civil rights movement]]s also brought about expansion of the ethical system for their particular domains. Likewise deep ecology brought the whole of nature under moral consideration.&lt;ref name="Zimmermann"&gt;{{cite journal

Many in the radical environmental direct-action movement [[Earth First!]] claim to follow deep ecology, as indicated by one of their slogans ''No compromise in defence of mother earth''. In particular, [[David Foreman]], the co-founder of the movement, has also been a strong advocate for deep ecology, and engaged in a public debate with [[Murray Bookchin]] on the subject.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Judi Bari]] was another prominent Earth Firster who espoused deep ecology. Many Earth First! actions have a distinct deep ecological theme; often these actions will be to save an area of [[old growth forest]], the habitat of a snail or an owl, even individual trees. Actions are often symbolic or have other political aims. At one point Arne Næss also engaged in environmental direct action, though not under the Earth First! banner, when he chained himself to rocks in front of [[Mardalsfossen]], a waterfall in a Norwegian [[fjord]], in a successful protest against the building of a dam.&lt;ref&gt;J.

There are also [[anarchism|anarchist]] currents in the movement, especially in the United Kingdom. For example, [[Robert Hart (horticulturist)|Robert Hart]], pioneer of [[forest gardening]] in temperate climates, wrote the essay "Can Life Survive?" in ''Deep Ecology &amp; Anarchism''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Deep Ecology &amp; Anarchism|publisher=Freedom Press|year=1993|url=http://theanarchistlibrary.org/HTML/Various_Authors__Deep_Ecology___Anarchism.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''theory of belief functions''', also referred to as '''evidence theory''' or '''Dempster–Shafer theory''' ('''DST'''), is a general framework for reasoning with uncertainty, with understood connections to other frameworks such as probability, possibility and imprecise probability theories. First introduced by [[Arthur P. Dempster]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1214/aoms/1177698950|title=Upper and lower probabilities induced by a multivalued mapping|journal=The Annals of Mathematical Statistics|year=1967|first=A. P.|last=Dempster|volume=38|issue=2|pages=325–339|id= |url= |format=|accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt; in the context of statistical inference, the theory was later developed by [[Glenn Shafer]] into a general framework for modeling epistemic uncertainty—a mathematical theory of [[evidence]].&lt;ref name="SH76"&gt;Shafer, Glenn; ''A Mathematical Theory of Evidence'', Princeton University Press, 1976, {{ISBN|0-608-02508-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Fine, Terrence L.|title=Review: Glenn Shafer, ''A mathematical theory of evidence''|journal=Bull. Amer. Math. Soc.|year=1977|volume=83|issue=4|pages=667–672|url=http://projecteuclid.org/euclid.bams/1183538896|doi=10.1090/s0002-9904-1977-14338-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; The theory allows one to combine evidence from different sources and arrive at a degree of belief (represented by a mathematical object called ''belief function'') that takes into account all the available evidence.

In a narrow sense, the term Dempster–Shafer theory refers to the original conception of the theory by Dempster and Shafer. However, it is more common to use the term in the wider sense of the same general approach, as adapted to specific kinds of situations. In particular, many authors have proposed different rules for combining evidence, often with a view to handling conflicts in evidence better.&lt;ref name=Sentz-Ferson&gt;Kari Sentz and Scott Ferson (2002); [http://www.sandia.gov/epistemic/Reports/SAND2002-0835.pdf ''Combination of Evidence in Dempster–Shafer Theory''], Sandia National Laboratories SAND 2002-0835&lt;/ref&gt; The early contributions have also been the starting points of many important developments, including the [[transferable belief model]] and the theory of hints.&lt;ref name="KM95" /&gt;

==Overview==
Dempster–Shafer theory is a generalization of the [[Bayesian probability|Bayesian theory of subjective probability]]. Belief functions base degrees of belief (or confidence, or trust) for one question on the probabilities for a related question. The degrees of belief themselves may or may not have the mathematical properties of probabilities; how much they differ depends on how closely the two questions are related.&lt;ref name="SH02"&gt;Shafer, Glenn; [http://www.glennshafer.com/assets/downloads/articles/article48.pdf ''Dempster–Shafer theory''], 2002&lt;/ref&gt; Put another way, it is a way of representing [[epistemology|epistemic]] plausibilities but it can yield answers that contradict those arrived at using [[probability theory]].

Often used as a method of [[sensor fusion]], Dempster–Shafer theory is based on two ideas: obtaining degrees of belief for one question from subjective probabilities for a related question, and Dempster's rule&lt;ref name="DE68"&gt;Dempster, Arthur P.; ''A generalization of Bayesian inference'', Journal of the Royal Statistical Society, Series B, Vol. 30, pp. 205–247, 1968&lt;/ref&gt; for combining such degrees of belief when they are based on independent items of evidence. In essence, the degree of belief in a proposition depends primarily upon the number of answers (to the related questions) containing the proposition, and the subjective probability of each answer. Also contributing are the rules of combination that reflect general assumptions about the data.

In this formalism a '''degree of belief''' (also referred to as a '''mass''') is represented as a '''belief function''' rather than a [[Bayesianism|Bayesian]] [[probability distribution]]. Probability values are assigned to ''sets'' of possibilities rather than single events: their appeal rests on the fact they naturally encode evidence in favor of propositions.

Dempster–Shafer theory assigns its masses to all of the subsets of the propositions that compose a system—in [[Set Theory|set-theoretic]] terms, the [[power set]] of the propositions. For instance, assume a situation where there are two related questions, or propositions, in a system. In this system, any belief function assigns mass to the first proposition, the second, both or neither.

===Belief and plausibility===
Shafer's formalism starts from a set of ''possibilities'' under consideration, for instance numerical values of a variable, or pairs of linguistic variables like "date and place of origin of a relic" (asking whether it is antique or a recent fake). A hypothesis is represented by a subset of this ''frame of discernment'', like "(Ming dynasty, China)", or "(19th century, Germany)".&lt;ref name="SH76"/&gt;{{rp|p.35f.}}

Shafer's framework allows for belief about such propositions to be represented as intervals, bounded by two values, ''belief'' (or ''support'') and ''plausibility'':

:''belief'' ≤ ''plausibility''.

In a first step, subjective probabilities (''masses'') are assigned to all subsets of the frame; usually, only a restricted number of sets will have non-zero mass (''focal elements'').&lt;ref name="SH76"/&gt;{{rp|39f.}} ''Belief'' in a hypothesis is constituted by the sum of the masses of all subsets of the hypothesis-set. It is the amount of belief that directly supports either the given hypothesis or a more specific one, thus forming a lower bound on its probability.  Belief (usually denoted ''Bel'') measures the strength of the evidence in favor of a proposition ''p''.  It ranges from 0 (indicating no evidence) to 1 (denoting certainty).  ''Plausibility'' is 1 minus the sum of the masses of all sets whose intersection with the hypothesis is empty. Or, it can be obtained as the sum of the masses of all sets whose intersection with the hypothesis is not empty. It is an upper bound on the possibility that the hypothesis could be true, ''i.e.'' it “could possibly be the true state of the system” up to that value, because there is only so much evidence that contradicts that hypothesis.  Plausibility (denoted by Pl) is defined to be Pl(''p'')&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;1&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus;&amp;nbsp;Bel(~''p'').  It also ranges from 0 to 1 and measures the extent to which evidence in favor of ~''p'' leaves room for belief in ''p''.

For example, suppose we have a belief of 0.5 and a plausibility of 0.8 for a proposition, say “the cat in the box is dead.” This means that we have evidence that allows us to state strongly that the proposition is true with a confidence of 0.5. However, the evidence contrary to that hypothesis (i.e. “the cat is alive”) only has a confidence of 0.2. The remaining mass of 0.3 (the gap between the 0.5 supporting evidence on the one hand, and the 0.2 contrary evidence on the other) is “indeterminate,” meaning that the cat could either be dead or alive.  This interval represents the level of uncertainty based on the evidence in your system.

{| class="wikitable"
! Hypothesis !! Mass !! Belief!! Plausibility
|-
| Null (neither alive nor dead) || 0 || 0 || 0
|-
| Alive || 0.2 || 0.2 || 0.5
|-
| Dead || 0.5 || 0.5 || 0.8
|-
| Either (alive or dead) || 0.3 || 1.0 || 1.0
|}

The null hypothesis is set to zero by definition (it corresponds to “no solution”). The orthogonal hypotheses “Alive” and “Dead” have probabilities of 0.2 and 0.5, respectively. This could correspond to “Live/Dead Cat Detector” signals, which have respective reliabilities of 0.2 and 0.5. Finally, the all-encompassing “Either” hypothesis (which simply acknowledges there is a cat in the box) picks up the slack so that the sum of the masses is 1. The belief for the “Alive” and “Dead” hypotheses matches their corresponding masses because they have no subsets; belief for “Either” consists of the sum of all three masses (Either, Alive, and Dead) because “Alive” and “Dead” are each subsets of “Either”. The “Alive” plausibility is 1&amp;nbsp;−&amp;nbsp;''m'' (Dead) and the “Dead” plausibility is 1&amp;nbsp;−&amp;nbsp;''m'' (Alive).  In other way, the “Alive” plausibility is ''m''(Alive) + ''m'' (Either) and the “Dead” plausibility is ''m''(Dead) + ''m''(Either). Finally, the “Either” plausibility sums ''m''(Alive)&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;''m''(Dead)&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;''m''(Either). The universal hypothesis (“Either”) will always have 100% belief and plausibility—it acts as a [[checksum]] of sorts.

Here is a somewhat more elaborate example where the behavior of belief and plausibility begins to emerge. We're looking through a variety of detector systems at a single faraway signal light, which can only be coloured in one of three colours (red, yellow, or green):

{| class="wikitable"
! Hypothesis !! Mass !! Belief !! Plausibility
|-
| Null || 0 || 0 || 0
|-
| Red || 0.35 || 0.35 || 0.56
|-
| Yellow || 0.25 || 0.25 || 0.45
|-
| Green || 0.15 || 0.15 || 0.34
|-
| Red or Yellow || 0.06 || 0.66 || 0.85
|-
| Red or Green || 0.05 || 0.55 || 0.75
|-
| Yellow or Green || 0.04 || 0.44 || 0.65
|-
| Any || 0.1 || 1.0 || 1.0
|}

Events of this kind would not be modeled as disjoint sets in probability space as they are here in mass assignment space. Rather the event "Red or Yellow" would be considered as the union of the events "Red" and "Yellow", and (see [[probability axioms]]) ''P''(Red or Yellow) ≥ ''P''(Yellow), and ''P''(Any)&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;1, where ''Any'' refers to ''Red'' or ''Yellow'' or ''Green''. In DST the mass assigned to ''Any'' refers to the proportion of evidence that can't be assigned to any of the other states, which here means evidence that says there is a light but doesn't say anything about what color it is. In this example, the proportion of evidence that shows the light is either ''Red'' or ''Green'' is given a mass of 0.05. Such evidence might, for example, be obtained from a R/G color blind person. DST lets us extract the value of this sensor's evidence. Also, in DST the Null set is considered to have zero mass, meaning here that the signal light system exists and we are examining its possible states, not speculating as to whether it exists at all.

===Combining beliefs===
Beliefs from different sources can be combined with various fusion operators to model specific situations of belief fusion, e.g. with [[#Dempster's rule of combination|Dempster's rule of combination]], which combines belief constraints&lt;ref name="Jos12"&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Jøsang, A. |author2=Simon, P.|title=Dempster's Rule as Seen by Little Colored Balls|journal=Computational Intelligence|year=2012|volume=28|issue=4|pages=453–474|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1467-8640.2012.00421.x/pdf|doi=10.1111/j.1467-8640.2012.00421.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; that are dictated by independent belief sources, such as in the case of combining hints&lt;ref name="KM95"&gt;Kohlas, J., and Monney, P.A., 1995. ''A Mathematical Theory of Hints. An Approach to the Dempster–Shafer Theory of Evidence''. Vol. 425 in Lecture Notes in Economics and Mathematical Systems. Springer Verlag.&lt;/ref&gt; or combining preferences.&lt;ref name="JH12"&gt;Jøsang, A., and Hankin, R., 2012. ''Interpretation and Fusion of Hyper Opinions in Subjective Logic''. 15th International Conference on Information Fusion (FUSION)  2012. E-{{ISBN|978-0-9824438-4-2}}, IEEE.|url=http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&amp;arnumber=6289948&lt;/ref&gt; Note that the probability masses from propositions that contradict each other can be used to obtain a measure of conflict between the independent belief sources. Other situations can be modeled with different fusion operators, such as cumulative fusion of beliefs from independent sources which can be modeled with the cumulative fusion operator.&lt;ref name="JDR10"&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Jøsang, A. |author2=Diaz, J. |author3=Rifqi, M. |last-author-amp=yes |title=Cumulative and averaging fusion of beliefs|journal=Information Fusion|year=2010|volume=11|issue=2|pages=192–200|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S156625350900044X|doi=10.1016/j.inffus.2009.05.005}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Dempster's rule of combination is sometimes interpreted as an approximate generalisation of [[Bayes' rule]]. In this interpretation the priors and conditionals need not be specified, unlike traditional Bayesian methods, which often use a symmetry (minimax error) argument to assign prior probabilities to random variables (''e.g.'' assigning 0.5 to binary values for which no information is available about which is more likely). However, any information contained in the missing priors and conditionals is not used in Dempster's rule of combination unless it can be obtained indirectly—and arguably is then available for calculation using Bayes equations.

Dempster–Shafer theory allows one to specify a degree of ignorance in this situation instead of being forced to supply prior probabilities that add to unity. This sort of situation, and whether there is a real distinction between ''[[risk]]'' and ''[[ignorance]]'', has been extensively discussed by statisticians and economists. See, for example, the contrasting views of [[Ellsberg's paradox|Daniel Ellsberg]], [[Howard Raiffa]], [[Arrovian uncertainty|Kenneth Arrow]] and [[Knightian uncertainty|Frank Knight]].{{Citation needed|reason=The contrast between these views, or some summary of the discussion, should be referenced in the citation.

==Formal definition==
Let ''X'' be the ''[[Universe (mathematics)|universe]]'': the set representing all possible states of a system under consideration. The [[power set]]

:&lt;math&gt;2^X \,\!&lt;/math&gt;

is the set of all subsets of ''X'', including the [[empty set]]&amp;nbsp;&lt;math&gt;\emptyset&lt;/math&gt;. For example, if:

:&lt;math&gt;X = \left \{ a, b \right \} \,\!&lt;/math&gt;

then

:&lt;math&gt;2^X = \left \{ \emptyset, \left \{ a \right \}, \left \{ b \right \}, X \right \}. \,&lt;/math&gt;

The elements of the power set can be taken to represent propositions concerning the actual state of the system, by containing all and only the states in which the proposition is true.

The theory of evidence assigns a belief mass to each element of the power set. Formally, a function

:&lt;math&gt;m: 2^X \rightarrow [0,1] \,\!&lt;/math&gt;

is called a ''basic belief assignment'' (BBA), when it has two properties. First, the mass of the empty set is zero:

:&lt;math&gt;m(\emptyset) = 0. \,\!&lt;/math&gt;

Second, the masses of the remaining members of the power set add up to a total of 1:

:&lt;math&gt;\sum_{A \in 2^X} m(A) = 1 \,\!&lt;/math&gt;

The mass ''m''(''A'') of ''A'', a given member of the power set, expresses the proportion of all relevant and available evidence that supports the claim that the actual state belongs to ''A'' but to no particular subset of ''A''. The value of ''m''(''A'') pertains ''only'' to the set ''A'' and makes no additional claims about any subsets of ''A'', each of which have, by definition, their own mass.

From the mass assignments, the upper and lower bounds of a probability interval can be defined. This interval contains the precise probability of a set of interest (in the classical sense), and is bounded by two non-additive continuous measures called '''belief''' (or '''support''') and '''plausibility''':

:&lt;math&gt;\operatorname{bel}(A) \le P(A) \le \operatorname{pl}(A).&lt;/math&gt;

The belief bel(''A'') for a set ''A'' is defined as the sum of all the masses of subsets of the set of interest:

:&lt;math&gt;\operatorname{bel}(A) = \sum_{B \mid B \subseteq A} m(B). \, &lt;/math&gt;

The plausibility pl(''A'') is the sum of all the masses of the sets ''B'' that intersect the set of interest ''A'':

:&lt;math&gt;\operatorname{pl}(A) = \sum_{B \mid B \cap A \ne \emptyset} m(B). \, &lt;/math&gt;

The two measures are related to each other as follows:

:&lt;math&gt;\operatorname{pl}(A) = 1 - \operatorname{bel}(\overline{A}).\,&lt;/math&gt;

And conversely, for finite ''A'', given the belief measure bel(''B'') for all subsets ''B'' of ''A'', we can find the masses m(''A'') with the following inverse function:

:&lt;math&gt;m(A) = \sum_{B \mid B \subseteq A} (-1)^{|A-B|}\operatorname{bel}(B) \, &lt;/math&gt;

where |''A''&amp;nbsp;−&amp;nbsp;''B''| is the difference of the cardinalities of the two sets.&lt;ref name=Sentz-Ferson/&gt;

It [[Logical consequence|follows from]] the last two equations that, for a finite set ''X'', you need know only one of the three (mass, belief, or plausibility) to deduce the other two; though you may need to know the values for many sets in order to calculate one of the other values for a particular set. In the case of an infinite ''X'', there can be well-defined belief and plausibility functions but no well-defined mass function.&lt;ref&gt;J.Y. Halpern (2003) ''Reasoning about Uncertainty'' MIT Press&lt;/ref&gt;

==Dempster's rule of combination==
The problem we now face is how to combine two independent sets of probability mass assignments in specific situations. In case different sources express their beliefs over the frame in terms of belief constraints  such as in case of giving hints or in case of expressing preferences, then Dempster's rule of combination is the appropriate fusion operator. This rule derives common shared belief between multiple sources and ignores ''all'' the conflicting (non-shared) belief through a normalization factor. Use of that rule in other situations than that of combining belief constraints has come under serious criticism, such as  in case of fusing separate beliefs estimates from multiple sources that are to be integrated in a cumulative manner, and not as constraints. Cumulative fusion means that all probability masses from the different sources are reflected in the derived belief, so no probability mass is ignored.

Specifically, the combination (called the '''joint mass''') is calculated from the two sets of masses ''m''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; and ''m''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; in the following manner:

:&lt;math&gt;m_{1,2}(\emptyset) = 0 \, &lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;m_{1,2}(A) = (m_1 \oplus m_2) (A) = \frac 1 {1 - K} \sum_{B \cap C = A \ne \emptyset} m_1(B) m_2(C) \,\!&lt;/math&gt;

where

:&lt;math&gt;K = \sum_{B \cap C = \emptyset} m_1(B) m_2(C). \, &lt;/math&gt;

''K'' is a measure of the amount of conflict between the two mass sets.

===Effects of conflict===
The normalization factor above, 1&amp;nbsp;−&amp;nbsp;''K'', has the effect of completely ignoring conflict and attributing ''any'' mass associated with conflict to the null set. This combination rule for evidence can therefore produce counterintuitive results, as we show next.

====Example producing correct results in case of high conflict====
The following example shows how Dempster's rule produces intuitive results when applied in a preference fusion situation, even when there is high conflict.

:Suppose that two friends, Alice and Bob, want to see a film at the cinema one evening, and that there are only three films showing: X, Y and Z. Alice expresses her preference for film X with probability 0.99, and her preference for film Y with a probability of only 0.01. Bob expresses his preference for film Z with probability 0.99, and his preference for film Y with a probability of only 0.01. When combining the preferences with Dempster's rule of combination it turns out that their combined preference results in probability 1.0 for film Y, because it is the only film that they both agree to see.

:Dempster's rule of combination produces intuitive results even in case of totally conflicting beliefs when interpreted in this way. Assume that Alice prefers film X with probability 1.0, and that Bob prefers film Z with probability 1.0. When trying to combine their preferences with Dempster's rule it turns out that it is undefined in this case, which means that there is no solution. This would mean that they can not agree on seeing any film together, so they don't go to the cinema together that evening. However, the semantics of interpreting preference as a probability is vague: if it is referring to the probability of seeing film X tonight, then we face the [[False dilemma|Fallacy of the excluded middle]]: the event that actually occurs, seeing none of the films tonight, has a probability mass of 0.

====Example producing counter-intuitive results in case of high conflict====
An example with exactly the same numerical values was introduced by Zadeh in 1979,&lt;ref name="Zadeh79"&gt;L. Zadeh, On the validity of Dempster's rule of combination, Memo M79/24, Univ. of California, Berkeley, USA, 1979&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Zadeh84"&gt;L. Zadeh, Book review: A mathematical theory of evidence, The Al Magazine, Vol. 5, No. 3, pp. 81–83, 1984&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Zadeh86"&gt;L. Zadeh, A simple view of the Dempster–Shafer Theory of Evidence and its implication for the rule of combination, The Al Magazine, Vol. 7, No. 2, pp. 85–90, Summer 1986.&lt;/ref&gt;
to point out counter-intuitive results generated by Dempster's rule when there is a high degree of conflict. The example goes as follows:

:Suppose that one has two equi-reliable doctors and one doctor believes a patient has either a brain tumor, with a probability (i.e. a basic belief assignment—bba's, or mass of belief) of 0.99; or meningitis, with a probability of only 0.01. A second doctor believes the patient has a concussion, with a probability of 0.99, and believes the patient suffers from meningitis, with a probability of only 0.01. Applying  Dempster’s rule to combine these two sets of masses of belief, one gets finally ''m(meningitis)=1'' (the meningitis is diagnosed with 100 percent of confidence).

Such result goes against the common sense since both doctors agree that there is a little chance that the patient has a meningitis. This example has been the starting point of many research works for trying to find a solid justification for Dempster's rule and for foundations of Dempster–Shafer Theory&lt;ref name="Ruspini88"&gt;E. Ruspini, "The logical foundations of evidential reasoning", ''SRI Technical Note'' '''408''', December 20, 1986 (revised April 27, 1987)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Wilson93"&gt;N. Wilson, "The assumptions behind Dempster's rule", in ''Proceedings of the 9th Conference on Uncertainty in Artificial Intelligence'', pages 527–534, Morgan Kaufmann Publishers, San Mateo, CA, USA, 1993&lt;/ref&gt; or to show the inconsistencies of this theory.&lt;ref name="Voorbraak88"&gt;F. Voorbraak, "On the justification of Dempster's rule of combination", ''Artificial Intelligence'', Vol. '''48''', pp. 171–197, 1991&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Wang1994"&gt;Pei Wang, "A Defect in Dempster–Shafer Theory", in ''Proceedings of the 10th Conference on Uncertainty in Artificial Intelligence'', pages 560–566, Morgan Kaufmann Publishers, San Mateo, CA, USA, 1994&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Walley91"&gt;P. Walley, "Statistical Reasoning with Imprecise Probabilities", Chapman and Hall, London, pp. 278–281, 1991&lt;/ref&gt;

====Example producing counter-intuitive results in case of low conflict====
The following example shows where Dempster's rule produces a counter-intuitive result, even when there is low conflict.

:Suppose that one doctor believes a patient has either a brain tumor, with a probability of 0.99, or meningitis, with a probability of only 0.01. A second doctor also believes the patient has a brain tumor, with a probability of 0.99, and believes the patient suffers from concussion, with a probability of only 0.01. If we calculate m (brain tumor) with Dempster’s rule, we obtain

::&lt;math&gt;m(\text{brain tumor}) = \operatorname{Bel}(\text{brain tumor}) = 1. \, &lt;/math&gt;

This result implies ''complete support'' for the diagnosis of a brain tumor, which both doctors believed ''very likely''. The agreement arises from the low degree of conflict between the two sets of evidence comprised by the two doctors' opinions.

In either case, it would be reasonable to expect that:

:&lt;math&gt;m(\text{brain tumor}) &lt; 1\text{ and } \operatorname{Bel}(\text{brain tumor}) &lt; 1,\,&lt;/math&gt;

since the existence of non-zero belief probabilities for other diagnoses implies ''less than complete support'' for the brain tumour diagnosis.

== Dempster–Shafer as a generalisation of Bayesian theory  ==
As in Dempster–Shafer theory, a Bayesian belief function  &lt;math&gt;\operatorname{bel}: 2^X \rightarrow [0,1] \,\!&lt;/math&gt; has the properties &lt;math&gt;\operatorname{bel}(\emptyset) = 0&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\operatorname{bel}(X) = 1&lt;/math&gt;. The third condition, however, is subsumed by, but relaxed in DS theory:&lt;ref name="SH76"/&gt;{{rp|p. 19}}
:&lt;math&gt;\text{If } A \cap B = \emptyset, \text{ then} \operatorname{bel}(A \cup B) = \operatorname{bel}(A) + \operatorname{bel} (B).&lt;/math&gt;

For example, a Bayesian would model the color of a car as a probability distribution over (red, green, blue), assigning one number to each color.   Dempster–Shafer would assign numbers to each of (red, green, blue, (red or green), (red or blue), (green or blue), (red or green or blue)) which do not have to cohere, for example Bel(red)+Bel(green) != Bel(red or green).    This may be computationally more efficient if a witness reports "I saw that the car was either blue or green" in which case the belief can be assigned in a single step rather than breaking down into values for two separate colors.  However this can lead to irrational conclusions.

Equivalently, each of the following conditions defines the Bayesian special case of the DS theory:&lt;ref name="SH76"/&gt;{{rp|p. 37,45}}
* &lt;math&gt;\operatorname{bel}(A) + \operatorname{bel}(\bar{A}) = 1 \text{ for all } A \subseteq X.&lt;/math&gt;
* For finite ''X'', all focal elements of the belief function are singletons.

Bayes' conditional probability is a special case of Dempster's rule of combination.&lt;ref name="SH76"/&gt;{{rp|p. 19f.}}

It has been argued{{Citation needed|date=January 2018}} that DS theory provides a clearer distinction between epistemic uncertainty and physical uncertainty than Bayesian theory.   For example, the height of an unobserved person from a population may have a Gaussian belief distribution with a high variance, but Bayesian theory obtains the same distribution in the case where all people are the same height but little data is available about what that height is, as in the case where there is a wide range of physically different heights in the population.   Standard Bayesian theory may lead to suboptimal decisions{{citation needed|date=March 2016}} if this difference is not accounted for using [[second-order probability]] and machinery to estimate utilities of information-gathering actions.

It has also been argued&lt;ref&gt;Dezert J., Tchamova A., Han D., Tacnet J.-M., Why Dempster’s fusion rule is not a generalization of Bayes fusion rule, Proc. Of Fusion 2013 Int. Conference on Information Fusion, Istanbul, Turkey, July 9–12, 2013&lt;/ref&gt; that DS theory is /not/ a generalisation of Bayesian theory.

functions represent the probability that a given proposition is ''provable'' from a set of other propositions, to which probabilities are assigned. Confusing probabilities of ''truth'' with probabilities of ''provability'' may lead to counterintuitive results in reasoning tasks such as (1) representing incomplete knowledge, (2) belief-updating and (3) evidence pooling. He further demonstrated that, if partial knowledge is encoded and updated by belief function methods, the resulting beliefs cannot serve as a basis for rational decisions.

Proc. 1st International Conference RSCTC'98'', Warsaw, June 22–26, 1998, ''Lecture Notes in Artificial Intelligence 1424'', Springer-Verlag, pp. 346–353.&lt;/ref&gt; proposed to interpret the Dempster–Shafer theory in terms of statistics of decision tables (of the [[rough set theory]]), whereby the operator of combining evidence should be seen as relational joining of decision tables.

&lt;/ref&gt; propose to view this theory as describing destructive material processing (under loss of properties), ''e.g.'' like in some semiconductor production processes. Under both interpretations reasoning in DST gives correct results, contrary to the earlier probabilistic interpretations, criticized by Pearl in the cited papers and by other researchers.

Jøsang proved that Dempster's rule of combination actually is a method for fusing belief constraints.&lt;ref name="Jos12"/&gt; It only represents an approximate fusion operator in other situations, such as cumulative fusion of beliefs, but generally produces incorrect results in such situations. The confusion around the validity of Dempster's rule therefore originates in the failure of correctly interpreting the nature of situations to be modeled. Dempster's rule of combination always produces correct and intuitive results in situation of fusing belief constraints from different sources.

The '''''Enchiridion''''' or '''''[[Handbook]] of Epictetus''''' ({{lang-grc|Ἐγχειρίδιον Ἐπικτήτου}}, ''Enkheirídion Epiktḗtou'') is a short manual of [[Stoicism|Stoic]] ethical advice compiled by [[Arrian]], a 2nd-century disciple of the Greek philosopher [[Epictetus]]. Although the content is mostly derived from the ''[[Discourses of Epictetus]]'', it is not a summary of the ''Discourses'' but rather a compilation of practical precepts. Eschewing [[metaphysics]], Arrian focuses his attention on Epictetus's work applying philosophy to daily life. The book is thus a manual to show the way to achieve mental freedom and happiness in all circumstances.

The ''Enchiridion'' was well-known in the ancient world, and in the medieval period it was specially adapted for use in Greek-speaking monasteries. In the 15th-century it was translated into [[Latin]], and then, with the advent of printing, into multiple European languages. It reached the height of popularity in the 17th century, in parallel with the [[Neostoicism]] movement.

==Title==
The word "encheiridion" ({{lang-grc|ἐγχειρίδιον}}) is an adjective meaning "in the hand" or "ready to hand".&lt;ref name="matty263"&gt;{{Harvnb|Matheson|1916|p=263}}&lt;/ref&gt; The word sometimes meant a handy sword, or dagger, but coupled with the word "book" (''biblion'', {{lang-el|βιβλίον}}) it means a handy book or hand-book.&lt;ref name="matty263"/&gt; Epictetus in the ''Discourses'' often speaks of principles which his pupils should have "ready to hand" ({{lang-el|πρόχειρα}}).&lt;ref name="matty263"/&gt; Common English translations of the title are '''Manual''' or '''Handbook'''.&lt;ref name="oldfart_xii"&gt;{{Harvnb|Oldfather|1925|p=xii}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Writing==
The work consists of fifty-three short chapters typically consisting of a paragraph or two. It was compiled some time in the early 2nd-century. The 6th-century philosopher [[Simplicius of Cilicia|Simplicius]], in his ''Commentary'' on the work, refers to a letter written by Arrian which prefaced the text.&lt;ref name="boat_xiii"&gt;{{Harvnb|Boter|1999|p=xiii}}&lt;/ref&gt; In this letter Arrian stated that the ''Enchiridion'' was selected from the ''[[Discourses of Epictetus]]'' according to what he considered to be most useful, most necessary, and most adapted to move people's minds.&lt;ref name="longxiii"&gt;{{Harvnb|Long|1877|p=xiii}}&lt;/ref&gt; Around half of the material in the ''Enchiridion'' has been shown to have been derived from the surviving four books of ''Discourses'' but variously modified.&lt;ref name="oldfart2_479"&gt;{{Harvnb|Oldfather|1928|p=479}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other parts are presumed to be derived from the lost ''Discourses''.&lt;ref name="hard346"&gt;{{Harvnb|Hard|2014|p=346}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some chapters appear to be reformulations of ideas which appear throughout the ''Discourses''.&lt;ref name="hard346"/&gt;

There are some puzzles concerning the inclusion of two chapters. Chapter 29 is practically word for word identical with ''Discourse'' iii.&amp;nbsp;15.&lt;ref name="oldfart2_506"&gt;{{Harvnb|Oldfather|1928|p=506}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since it was omitted in one of the early Christian editions (''Par''), and not commented on by Simplicius, it may not have been in the original edition.&lt;ref name="oldfart2_506"/&gt;&lt;ref name="boat_127"&gt;{{Harvnb|Boter|1999|p=127}}&lt;/ref&gt; Chapter 33 consists of a list of moral instructions, which are "not obviously related to Epictetus' normal Stoic framework."&lt;ref name="hard346"/&gt;

The current division of the work into fifty-three chapters was first adopted by [[Johann Schweighäuser]] in his 1798 edition; earlier editions tended to divide the text into more chapters (especially splitting chapter 33).&lt;ref name="boat_146-7"&gt;{{Harvnb|Boter|1999|p=146-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; Gerard Boter in his 1999 [[critical edition]] keeps Schweighäuser's fifty-three chapters but splits chapters 5, 14, 19, and 48 into two parts.&lt;ref name="boat_146-7"/&gt;

==Contents==
The ''Enchiridion'' appears to be a loosely-structured selection of maxims.&lt;ref name="brittybrenny_6"&gt;{{Harvnb|Brittain|Brennan|2002|p=6}}&lt;/ref&gt; In his 6th-century ''Commentary'', Simplicius divided the text into four distinct sections suggesting a graded approach to philosophy:&lt;ref name="brittybrenny_6"/&gt;

Chapter 29, which was probably absent from the text used by Simplicius, is a one-page ''Discourse'' which compares the training needed to become a Stoic with the rigorous approach needed to become an Olympic victor.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Hard|2014|p=331}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Themes==
The ''Enchiridion'' begins with the statement that "Of things, some depend upon ourselves, others do not depend upon ourselves."&lt;ref name="rolypoly_xvii"&gt;{{Harvnb|Rolleston|1881|p=xvii}}&lt;/ref&gt; So it starts with announcing that the business and concern of the real self is with matters subject to its own control, uninfluenced by external chance or change.&lt;ref name="rolypoly_xviii"&gt;{{Harvnb|Rolleston|1881|p=xviii}}&lt;/ref&gt; Epictetus makes a sharp distinction between our own internal world of mental benefits and harms, and the external world beyond our control.&lt;ref name="aalong_xxxvi"&gt;{{Harvnb|Long|2018|p=xxxvi}}&lt;/ref&gt; Freedom is to wish for nothing which is not up to ourselves.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Long|2018|p=xlv}}&lt;/ref&gt; When we are tried by misfortune we should never let our suffering overwhelm our sense of inward mastery and freedom.&lt;ref name="rolypoly_xviii"/&gt; 

A constant vigilance is required, and one should never relax attention to one's reason, for it is judgements, not things, which disturb people.&lt;ref name="along93"&gt;{{Harvnb|Long|2003|p=93}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

{{quote|What upsets people is not things themselves but their judgments about the things.  For example, "death is nothing dreadful (or else it would have appeared dreadful to [[Socrates]])&amp;nbsp;.&amp;nbsp;.&amp;nbsp;."|Chapter Five&lt;ref name="handbook"&gt;''Handbook of Epictetus'', trans. Nicholas P. White, Hackett Publishing Company, 1983.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Reason is the decisive principle in everything.&lt;ref name="aalong_xxxvi"/&gt; Thus we must exercise our power of assent over impressions, and wish for nothing nor avoid anything that is up to other people.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Long|2018|p=xliv}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

To a large extent the ''Enchiridion'' suppresses many of the more amiable aspects of Epictetus which can be found in the ''Discourses'', but this reflects the nature of the compilation.&lt;ref name="oldfart_xix"&gt;{{Harvnb|Oldfather|1925|p=xix}}&lt;/ref&gt; Unlike the ''Discourses'' which seeks to encourage the student through argument and logic, the ''Enchiridion'' largely consists of a set of rules to follow.&lt;ref name="wrighty_333"&gt;{{Harvnb|Wright|2007|p=333}}&lt;/ref&gt; The work is built on the conception that the wise person, by the aid of philosophy, may reap benefit from every experience in life.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Rolleston|1881|pp=xxvi-xxvii}}&lt;/ref&gt; With proper training the student can flourish in adverse situations as well as favourable ones.&lt;ref name="aalong_xxxv"&gt;{{Harvnb|Long|2018|p=xxxv}}&lt;/ref&gt; The human spirit has capacities as yet undeveloped, but which it is for our good to develop.&lt;ref name="rolypoly_xx"&gt;{{Harvnb|Rolleston|1881|p=xx}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thus the book is a manual on how to make progress towards what is necessary and sufficient for happiness.&lt;ref name="aalong_xxxv"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Long|2018|p=xxxvii}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Epictetus makes a vivid use of imagery, and analogies include life depicted as: a ship's voyage (Ch. 7), an inn (Ch. 11), a banquet (Chs. 15, 36), and acting in a play (Ch. 17, 37).&lt;ref name="brittybrenny_7"&gt;{{Harvnb|Brittain|Brennan|2002|p=7}}&lt;/ref&gt; He takes many examples from everyday life, including: a broken jug (Ch. 3), a trip to the baths (Chs. 4, 43), his own lameness (Ch. 9), the loss of a child (Ch. 11), and the price of lettuce (Ch. 25).&lt;ref name="brittybrenny_7"/&gt;

==Subsequent history==
[[File:Epicteti Enchiridion, Angelo Politiano interprete (Basel 1554) page 1.jpg|thumb|right|Latin translation by Angelo Poliziano (Basel 1554)]]
For many centuries, the ''Enchiridion'' maintained its authority both with [[Paganism|Pagans]] and [[Christian]]s.&lt;ref name="smithy351"&gt;{{Harvnb|Schmitz|1870|p=351}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Simplicius of Cilicia]] wrote a commentary upon it in the 6th century, and in the [[Byzantine era]] Christian writers wrote paraphrases of it.&lt;ref name="smithy351"/&gt; Over one hundred manuscripts of the ''Enchiridion'' survive.{{Ref label|A|a|none}} The oldest extant manuscripts of the authentic ''Enchiridion'' date from the 14th century, but the oldest Christianised ones date from the 10th and 11th centuries, perhaps indicating the Byzantine world's preference for the Christian versions.&lt;ref name="boat_xv"&gt;{{Harvnb|Boter|1999|p=xv}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ''Enchiridion'' was first translated into [[Latin]] by [[Niccolò Perotti]] in 1450, and then by [[Angelo Poliziano]] in 1479.&lt;ref name="boat_xv"/&gt;

The first printed edition (''[[editio princeps]]'') was Poliziano's Latin translation published in 1497.&lt;ref name="boat_xv"/&gt; The original Greek was first published (somewhat abbreviated) with Simplicius's ''Commentary'' in 1528.&lt;ref name="boat_xv"/&gt; The edition published by [[Johann Schweighäuser]] in 1798 was the major edition for the next two-hundred years.&lt;ref name="boat_xv"/&gt;&lt;ref name="oldfart_xxii"&gt;{{Harvnb|Oldfather|1925|p=xxii}}&lt;/ref&gt; A critical edition was produced by Gerard Boter in 1999.&lt;ref name="boat_xvi"&gt;{{Harvnb|Boter|1999|p=xvi}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The separate editions and translations of the ''Enchiridion'' are very many.&lt;ref name="oldfart_xxx"&gt;{{Harvnb|Oldfather|1925|p=xxx}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ''Enchiridion'' reached its height of popularity in the period 1550–1750.&lt;ref name="along261"&gt;{{Harvnb|Long|2003|p=261}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was translated into most European languages, and there were multiple translations in English, French, and German.&lt;ref name="along261"/&gt; The first English translation was by [[James Sandford (translator)|James Sandford]]  in 1567 (a translation of a French version) and this was followed by a translation (from the Greek) by [[John Healey (translator)|John Healey]] in 1610.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Wright|2007|pp=325-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ''Enchiridion'' was even partly translated into Chinese by the [[Jesuit]] missionary [[Matteo Ricci]].&lt;ref name="along261"/&gt; The popularity of the work was assisted by the [[Neostoicism]] movement initiated by [[Justus Lipsius]] in the 16th century.&lt;ref name="along262"&gt;{{Harvnb|Long|2003|p=262}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another Neostoic, [[Guillaume du Vair]], translated the book into French in 1586 and popularised it in his ''La Philosophie morale des Stoiques''.&lt;ref name="along263"&gt;{{Harvnb|Long|2003|p=263}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the English-speaking world it was particularly well-known in the 17th-century: at that time it was the ''Enchiridion'' rather than the ''Discourses'' which was usually read.&lt;ref name="wrighty_325"&gt;{{Harvnb|Wright|2007|p=325}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was among the books [[John Harvard (clergyman)|John Harvard]] bequeathed to the newly-founded [[Harvard College]] in 1638.&lt;ref name="along268"&gt;{{Harvnb|Long|2003|p=268}}&lt;/ref&gt; The work, being written in a clear distinct style, made it accessible to readers with no formal training in philosophy, and there was a wide readership among women in England.&lt;ref name="wrighty_326"&gt;{{Harvnb|Wright|2007|p=326}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ''Enchiridion'' was a common school text in Scotland during the [[Scottish Enlightenment]]—[[Adam Smith]] had a 1670 edition in his library, acquired as a schoolboy.&lt;ref name="phillipson"&gt;{{cite book | title=Adam Smith: An Enlightened Life | publisher=Yale University Press | author=Phillipson, Nicholas | year=2010 | pages=19 | url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=P830m6yCmYUC&amp;pg=PA1730&amp;vq=enchiridion}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the end of the 18th-century the ''Enchiridion'' is attested in the personal libraries of [[Benjamin Franklin]] and [[Thomas Jefferson]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|author1-last=Wolf|author1-first=Edwin|author2-last=Hayes|author2-first=Kevin J.|title=The Library of Benjamin Franklin|year=2006|page=278|publisher=American Philosophical Society|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=ibgiSlbMDPUC&amp;pg=PA278}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|author1-last=Gilreath|author1-first=James|author2-last=Wilson|author2-first=Douglas L.|title=Thomas Jefferson's Library: A Catalog with the Entries in His Own Order|year=2008|page=52|publisher=The Lawbook Exchange Ltd|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=PS7e0wujFRMC&amp;pg=PA52}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==The ''Commentary'' of Simplicius==
In the 6th-century the Neoplatonist philosopher Simplicius wrote a huge commentary on the ''Enchiridion'', which is more than ten times the bulk of the original text.&lt;ref name="oldfart2_480"&gt;{{Harvnb|Oldfather|1928|p=480}}&lt;/ref&gt; Chapter after chapter of the ''Enchiridion'' is dissected, discussed, and its lessons drawn out with a certain laboriousness.&lt;ref name="rolypoly_xiif"&gt;{{Harvnb|Rolleston|1881|pp=xii-xiii}}&lt;/ref&gt; Simplicius' commentary offers a distinctly [[Platonism|Platonist]] vision of the world,&lt;ref name="brittybrenny_vii"&gt;{{Harvnb|Brittain|Brennan|2002|p=vii}}&lt;/ref&gt; one which is often at odds with the Stoic content of the ''Enchiridion''.&lt;ref name="brittybrenny_4"&gt;{{Harvnb|Brittain|Brennan|2002|p=4}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sometimes Simplicius exceeds the scope of a commentary; thus his commentary on ''Enchiridion'' 27 (Simplicius ch. 35) becomes a refutation of [[Manichaeism]].&lt;ref name="boat_xiv"&gt;{{Harvnb|Boter|1999|p=xiv}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''Commentary'' enjoyed its own period of popularity in the 17th and 18th centuries. An English translation by [[George Stanhope]] in 1694 ran through four editions in the early 1700s.&lt;ref name="wrighty_326"/&gt; [[Edward Gibbon]] remarked in his ''[[Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire]]'' that Simplicius' ''Commentary'' on Epictetus "is preserved in the library of nations, as a classic book" unlike the commentaries on [[Aristotle]] "which have passed away with the fashion of the times."&lt;ref name="brittybrenny_vii"/&gt;

==Christian adaptations==
The ''Enchiridion'' was adapted three different times by Greek Christian writers. The oldest manuscript, ''Paraphrasis Christiana'' (''Par''), dates to the 10th century.&lt;ref name="boat_xiv"/&gt; Another manuscript, falsely ascribed to [[Nilus of Sinai|Nilus]] (''Nil''), dates to the 11th century.&lt;ref name="boat_xiv"/&gt; A third manuscript, Vaticanus gr. 2231 (''Vat''), dates to the 14th century.&lt;ref name="boat_xiv"/&gt; It is not known when the original versions of these manuscripts were first made.&lt;ref name="boat_xiv"/&gt;

These guides served as a rule and guide for monastic life.&lt;ref name="oldfart_xxvii"&gt;{{Harvnb|Oldfather|1925|p=xxvii}}&lt;/ref&gt; The most obvious changes are in the use of proper names: thus the name Socrates is sometimes changed to Paul.&lt;ref name="rolypoly_xiif"/&gt;&lt;ref name="oldfart_xxvii"/&gt; All three texts follow the ''Enchiridion'' quite closely, although the ''Par'' manuscript is more heavily modified: adding or omitting words, abridging or expanding passages, and occasionally inventing new passages.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Boter|1999|p=206}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 17th century the German monk Matthias Mittner did something similar, compiling a guide on mental tranquillity for the [[Carthusians|Carthusian Order]] by taking the first thirty-five of his fifty precepts from the ''Enchiridion''.&lt;ref name="oldfart_xxviii"&gt;{{Harvnb|Oldfather|1925|p=xxviii}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Notes==
{{Refbegin}}
'''a.''' {{Note label|A|a|none}} Gerard Boter in his 1999 critical edition catalogues 59 extant manuscripts of the ''Encheiridion'' proper, and another 27 manuscripts of Simplicius' ''Commentary'' which contain the ''Encheiridion'' as ''lemmata'' (headings). He also lists 37 Christianised manuscripts, (24 ''Par'', 12 ''Nil'', 1 ''Vat''). Cf. {{Harvnb|Boter|1999|pp=3ff}}

Goethals was born in [[Brooklyn, New York]] to [[Flemish people|Flemish]] immigrants from [[Stekene]], [[Belgium]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://people.zeelandnet.nl/vanput/genam.htm Genealogie van Egidius Goethals – HTML uitvoer van HAZA-DATA 7.2] (in [[Dutch language|Dutch]])&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://people.zeelandnet.nl/vanput/belgoet.htm Belangrijke Goethals'en] (in [[Dutch language|Dutch]])&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=CMH&gt;{{cite book| url=http://www.history.army.mil/html/books/panama/panamacanal/| title=The Panama Canal:An Army's Enterprise| publisher=[[United States Army Center of Military History]]| year=2009| id=CMH Pub 70-115-1| pages=13–15}}&lt;/ref&gt; Johannes Baptista (John Louis) Goethals, a carpenter, and wife Marie Le Barron. Aged 14, he entered the [[City College of New York|College of the City of New York]]. In April 1876, after three years of college, he won an appointment to the [[United States Military Academy]] at [[West Point, New York|West Point]]. He graduated second in his class in 1880,&lt;ref name=CMH /&gt; and was commissioned as second lieutenant in the [[United States Army Corps of Engineers|Army Corps of Engineers]].

==Military career==
Goethals remained at the military academy during the summer and fall of 1880 as an assistant instructor in practical [[astronomy]]. In 1881, he attended the Engineer School of Application at [[Fort Totten (New York)|Willets Point, New York]]. His first field assignment came in 1882 with his appointment as engineer officer of the Department of Columbia in [[Vancouver, Washington]].&lt;ref name=CMH /&gt; His routine duties included reconnaissance, surveys, and astronomical work, while his most consequential project was the replacement of a 120-foot bridge across the [[Spokane River]].

From 1885 to 1889, he taught civil and military engineering at West Point. He returned to the field in 1889 to assist Colonel John W. Barlow with navigational improvements on the [[Cumberland River]] and [[Tennessee River]].

While an instructor at West Point, Goethals agreed to tutor [[Charles Young (United States Army)|Charles Young]], the third African-American graduate of West Point; Young had failed an engineering class but – after being tutored by Goethals – passed and graduated in 1889.&lt;ref&gt;Shellum, Brian G., and Brooks, Vincent (2006). ''Black Cadet in a White Bastion'' (Lincoln, Nebraska: University of Nebraska Press), pp. 2, 123, 127-33.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1891, Goethals was promoted to captain. He soon was placed in charge of the completion of the [[Muscle Shoals Canal]] along the Tennessee River near [[Florence, Alabama]].&lt;ref name=CMH /&gt; This was his first independent command, and his responsibilities included the design and construction of the [[Riverton Lock]] at Colbert Shoals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Bishop|first1=Chip|title=Lion and the Journalist: The Unlikely Friendship of Theodore Roosevelt and Joseph Bucklin Bishop|date=November 8, 2011|publisher=Rowman &amp; Littlefield|isbn=978-0-7627-7754-9|page=203}}&lt;!--|accessdate=14 December 2015--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; His recommendation of a single lock with an unprecedented lift of twenty-six feet was initially opposed by his superiors in Washington, and he was forced to persuade the conservative army engineers of the merits of his design. The lock's successful construction set a world record for lock height.&lt;ref name=CMH /&gt; The success of the Riverton Lock inspired the eventual adoption of [[Lock (water navigation)|high-lift locks]] elsewhere, including those for the Panama Canal.

During the [[Spanish–American War]], he was [[Lieutenant colonel (United States)|lieutenant colonel]] and [[chief of engineers]] of [[United States Volunteers]].&lt;ref name=Ency&gt;{{cite book|last1=Tucker|first1=Spencer|title=The Encyclopedia of the Spanish-American and Philippine-American Wars: A Political, Social, and Military History|date=2009|publisher=ABC-CLIO|isbn=9781851099511|page=245|edition=Volume 1}}&lt;!--|accessdate=15 December 2015--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; In 1903, Goethals became a member of the first Army General Staff in Washington, D.C. and served as coastal defence expert.

[[File:PanamaCanal1913a.jpg|thumb|1000px|center|Construction of locks on the Panama Canal, 1913]]
[[Theodore Roosevelt]] believed that a US-controlled canal across Central America was a vital strategic interest of the country. Roosevelt encouraged the acquisition of the French Panama Canal effort. The purchase of the French-held land for $40&amp;nbsp;million was authorized by the June 28, 1902 [[Spooner Act]]. Since Panama was then part of [[Colombia]], Roosevelt began negotiating with that country to obtain the necessary rights. In early 1903 the [[Hay–Herrán Treaty]] was signed by both nations, but the [[Senate of Colombia]] failed to ratify the treaty.

Roosevelt implied to Panamanian rebels that if they revolted, the US Navy would assist their fight for independence. Panama declared its independence on November 3, 1903, and the [[USS Nashville (PG-7)|USS ''Nashville'']] impeded Colombian interference. The victorious Panamanians gave the United States control of the [[Panama Canal Zone]] on February 23, 1904, for $10&amp;nbsp;million in accordance with the November 18, 1903 [[Hay–Bunau-Varilla Treaty]].&lt;ref&gt;Parker, Matthew. (2008).Panama Fever: The Epic Story of One of the Greatest Human Achievements of All Time--The Building of the Panama Canal. Doubleday. {{ISBN|978-0385515344}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===United States takeover===

The United States took control of the French property—after the bankruptcy of the French ''Compagnie Universelle du Canal Interocéanique de Panama'' that started constructions on The Panama Canal under [[Ferdinand de Lesseps]]— on May 4, 1904. The new Panama Canal Zone Control was overseen by the [[Isthmian Canal Commission]] (ICC) during construction.

The US inherited a small workforce and an assortment of buildings, infrastructure and equipment, much of which had been neglected for fifteen years in the humid jungle environment. There were no facilities in place for a large workforce, and the infrastructure was crumbling.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=M6JAAQAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA2598&amp;lpg=PA2598&amp;dq=2148+buildings+panama+canal&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=dFkpYoqYC_&amp;sig=_KnYM4ss4TsR3guH8eH1wZHerY8&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=1DQtVcS_C8WtyATiwoHACQ&amp;ved=0CCYQ6AEwAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=2148%20buildings%20panama%20canal&amp;f=false] Annual Report of the Chief of Engineers, United States Army, Part 2.&lt;/ref&gt;

Although chief engineer [[John Findley Wallace]] was pressured to resume construction, [[red tape]] from Washington stifled his efforts to obtain heavy equipment and caused friction between Wallace and the ICC. He and chief sanitary officer [[William C. Gorgas]] were frustrated by delay, and Wallace resigned in 1905. He was replaced by [[John Frank Stevens]], who arrived on July 26, 1905. Stevens' approach was to press ahead first and obtain approval later. He improved drilling and dirt-removal equipment at the Culebra Cut for greater efficiency, revising the inadequate provisions in place for soil disposal. In November 1906 Roosevelt visited Panama to inspect the canal's progress, the first trip outside the United States by a sitting president.

===Chief engineer of the Panama Canal===
[[File:Panama Canal under construction, 1907.jpg|200px|thumb|right|Panama Canal under construction, 1907]]
Whether contract employees or government workers would build the canal was controversial. Bids for the canal's construction were opened in January 1907, and [[Knoxville, Tennessee]]-based contractor [[William J. Oliver (industrialist)|William J. Oliver]] was the low bidder.  Stevens disliked Oliver, and vehemently opposed his choice. Although Roosevelt initially favoured the use of a contractor, he eventually decided that army engineers should carry out the work{{ref|DuVal}}. According to the book ''The Panama Canal: An Army's Enterprise'', Goethals made such an impression on [[William Howard Taft]], then [[Secretary of War]], that Taft recommended him as an engineer for the Panama Canal.&lt;ref name=CMH /&gt; Stevens, frustrated by government inaction and the army involvement, resigned from his position.{{ref|Mellander}}

In February 1907 [[President of the United States|US President]] [[Theodore Roosevelt]] appointed Colonel George Washington Goethals chief engineer of the [[Panama Canal]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/americanexperience/features/general-article/panama-engineers/|title=WGBH American Experience .

"The Panama Canal: Writings of the U. S. Army Corps of Engineers Officers Who Conceived and Built It." p.1.&lt;/ref&gt;

Colonel Goethals received unstinted praise from visiting engineers and from the technical press of the world. In 1913 the degree of [[Legum Doctor|LL.D.]] was conferred on him by the [[University of Pennsylvania]], and in the spring of 1914 he was awarded medals by the [[National Geographic Society]], the Civic Forum (New York), and the National Institute of Social Sciences. In 1914, Goethals and [[William Crawford Gorgas]] were awarded the inaugural [[Public Welfare Medal]] from the [[United States National Academy of Sciences|National Academy of Sciences]].&lt;ref name=PublicWelfare&gt;{{cite web|title=Public Welfare Award |url=http://www.nasonline.org/site/PageServer?pagename=AWARDS_pwm |publisher=National Academy of Sciences |accessdate=14 February 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110604024100/http://www.nasonline.org/site/PageServer?pagename=AWARDS_pwm |archivedate=4 June 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Also, Congress awarded Goethals their thanks and a promotion to Major General. [[Woodrow Wilson|President Wilson]] appointed Goethals as the first [[List of Governors of Panama Canal Zone|Civil Governor of the Panama Canal Zone]].&lt;ref name=CMH /&gt;

==World War I==
General Goethals resigned from the post of Governor of the Canal Zone in 1916.&lt;ref name=CMH /&gt; Soon he was made chairman of the board of inquiry in regard to the [[Adamson Act|Adamson eight-hour law]].&lt;ref&gt;George W. Goethals papers. Library of congress. http://findingaids.loc.gov/db/search/xq/searchMfer02.xq?_id=loc.mss.eadmss.ms013029&amp;_faSection=overview&amp;_faSubsection=scopecontent&amp;_dmdid=d7475e20&lt;/ref&gt; His positions thereafter were: State engineer of New Jersey in 1917 and manager of the [[United States Shipping Board Merchant Fleet Corporation|Emergency Fleet Corporation]] (briefly). George Washington Goethals was appointed as [[Quartermaster general|acting Quartermaster General of the United States Army]] during the most crucial period of [[World War I]] (19 December 1917 to 9 May 1918) and was a member of the [[War Industries Board]] (1918).

In April 1917 George W. Goethals was serving at President [[Woodrow Wilson]]'s request, as General Manager and Director of the [[United States Shipping Board Merchant Fleet Corporation|Emergency Fleet Corporation]]— charged with creating improvised ships, to carry the American army and its supplies to France, in the shortest possible time.&lt;ref name="Anne Cipriano Venzon 2013 p. 294"&gt;Anne Cipriano Venzon (2013).

[[File:C01357-military rail transport Frizeville 1917.jpg|thumb|right|Transfer of ammunition from standard-gauge railway to trench railway during the [[Battle of Passchendaele]].]]

The United States as late as 1917 maintained only a small army, smaller than thirteen of the nations and empires already active in the war. After the passage of the [[Selective Service Act of 1917|Selective Service Act]] of May 1917, the U.S. drafted 4 million men into military service, the logistics demands were unprecedented.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sss.gov/induct.htm |title=Selective Service System: History and Records |publisher=Sss.gov |date= |accessdate=July 27, 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090507211238/http://www.sss.gov/induct.htm |archivedate=May 7, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; By the summer of 1918, about 2 million US soldiers had arrived in France and approximately 10,000 fresh soldiers were arriving in Europe each day.&lt;ref name="historyplace.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.historyplace.com/worldhistory/firstworldwar/index-1918.html |title=World War I Timeline - 1918 - A Fateful Ending |publisher=The History Place |date= |accessdate=2016-11-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Mainly as a result of [[Logistics in World War I|supply blunders]] during the bitter winter of 1917, a Congressional investigation was under way, when General Goethals was recalled to active service, and  was asked on 19 December 1917 to accept appointment as Acting Quartermaster General. Goethals did so only after [[Secretary of War]] [[Newton D. Baker]] had assured him full authority and that he would not be interfered with, nine days later he was appointed Director of the Storage &amp; Traffic Service. Reaction to his appointment at home and overseas is illustrated by a message he is said to have received from former President Theodore Roosevelt: "I congratulate you, and thrice over I congratulate the country."&lt;ref name="MAJOR ROY A. SHAW 1951"&gt;MAJOR ROY A. SHAW (1951) Two Acting Quartermasters General and their Assistant. The Quartermaster Review September–October 1951. Fort Lee, Virginia.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Army's [[Military supply chain management|supply chain]] suffered from 3 main problems; a shortage of specialized personnel, decentralized organization and diverse uncoordinated functions. When the United States entered the war, the [[Quartermaster Corps (United States Army)|Quartermaster Corps]] had suffered a loss of personnel —most officers were sent to the front—, this was the first problem demanding attention. Believing the Army's business could be best organized along civilian lines, he hired military men who could get along with industrialists and built with and around a number of highly trained executives and businessmen (among the new recruits were [[Hugh S. Johnson]] and [[Robert J. Thorne]]). Some of these men were commissioned and some were [[One-dollar salary|dollar-a-year-men]], most of whom never collected the dollar.&lt;ref name="Anne Cipriano Venzon 2013 p. 294"/&gt; From General Goethals down, practically everyone was on the job from early morning to late at night, seven days a week.&lt;ref name="Anne Cipriano Venzon 2013 p. 294"/&gt;

Goethals reorganized the corps along [[Line function|functional lines]] and by January 26, purchasing had been taken away from outside agencies, and placed under his control. The functions of each division and branch were specifically set forth and the personnel in charge was officially designated.&lt;ref&gt;Risch, Erna (1989). Quartermaster support of the Army : a history of the Corps, 1775-1939. Washington, DC. Center of Military History, United States Army. p.631.&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Departmental Reorganization Act|Overman Act]], a result of the Congressional investigations started in December 1917, authorized what became known as the "interbureau procurement system," and was to make the Quartermaster Corps the most important War Department purchasing agency. Goethals established a system of standardization of bureau record keeping and supply chain planning. He also worked on installing uniform procurement policies, with the goal of presenting consolidated estimates to congress.&lt;ref&gt;Risch, Erna (1989). Quartermaster support of the Army : a history of the Corps, 1775-1939. Washington, DC. Center of Military History, United States Army. p.640.&lt;/ref&gt;

In April 1918 a further reorganization of the General Staff led to the creation of the Purchase, Storage, &amp; Traffic Division, with General Goethals as Director and [[Vice Chief of Staff of the United States Army|Assistant Chief of Staff of the Army]]. Its creation was the result of protests by General Goethals, to the effect that, though coordination in the handling of [[Military logistics|Army logistics problems]] had been a major objective when the General Staff was created in 1903, coordination was practically non-existent.&lt;ref&gt;Anne Cipriano Venzon (2013). The United States in the First World War: An Encyclopedia. Routledge. p. 295.&lt;/ref&gt; In the months to come, his division took control of purchasing and storage by the Army as a whole —now one person coordinated all supply bureau's, which had previously competed for the nations resources, a system that had inevitably slowed down input of war supplies— and of transportation, over land and water.

At a meeting of Quartermaster personnel in Washington, on August 8, 1918, Secretary of War Baker said:&lt;ref name="MAJOR ROY A. SHAW 1951"/&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;"How fortunate this great army is to have so good and able a provider. Indeed, when the history of this war comes to be written, there will be chapters which have, up to now, almost escaped .... Today, I had a letter from General [[John J. Pershing]] in which he was commenting upon the perfection of supplies on the other side...."&lt;/blockquote&gt;

France and England were not the only overseas destinations for Quartermaster supplies. Among others were Italy, Hawaii, the Philippines, Puerto Rico, China, Russia, and Siberia. In a talk [[Leonard Wood|General Wood]] made at this meeting he mentioned that:

&lt;blockquote&gt;"... to handle this task, there are now in the Quartermaster Corps over eight thousand officers, one hundred and fifty-five thousand enlisted men, and sixty-five thousand civilian employees, and that number is being increased all the time to keep pace with the wants of our constantly increasing Army."&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In 1919, Goethals requested his release from active service.

===Honours and awards===
For his World War I service General Goethals, who retired March 1, 1919—and whom [[Peyton C. March|General March]] called "a great engineer, a great soldier, and the greatest Chief of Supply produced by any nation in the World War "—was awarded the [[U.S. Army Distinguished Service Medal|Distinguished Service Medal]]; was named Commander of the [[Legion of Honour|Legion of Honor]] by France and [[Order of the British Empire|Honorary Knight Commander]], by Great Britain; and was awarded the British [[Order of St Michael and St George|Order of St. Michael &amp; St. George]] and the Grand Cordon of the Order of Wen Hu by China. Previously he had been awarded many medals by scientific and geographic societies and some fifteen honorary degrees by universities and colleges.&lt;ref name="MAJOR ROY A. SHAW 1951"/&gt;

==Civilian life==
Later on, he headed an engineering and construction firm. He became the first consulting engineer of the Port of New York Authority (now the [[Port Authority of New York and New Jersey]]),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Davis, Jr.|first=Henry Blaine|title=Generals in Khaki|publisher=Pentland Press, Inc.|year= 1998

==Personal life and death==
In 1884, he married Effie Rodman; they had two sons.&lt;ref name=CMH /&gt; Goethals died at his apartment at 12 East [[86th Street (Manhattan)|86th Street]] in [[Manhattan, New York City]] on January 21, 1928.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Davis, Jr.|first=Henry Blaine|title=Generals in Khaki|publisher=Pentland Press, Inc.|year= 1998|ISBN= 1571970886|oclc=40298151|pages=149–150 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=obit&gt;{{cite news |author= |title=Gen.

'''Graham Harman''' (born May 9, 1968) is Distinguished Professor of Philosophy at [[SCI-Arc]] in Los Angeles.&lt;ref&gt;https://sciarc.edu/news/2016/philosopher-graham-harman-to-join-sci-arc/&lt;/ref&gt; His work on the [[metaphysics]] of objects led to the development of [[object-oriented ontology]]. He is a central figure in the [[speculative realism]] trend in contemporary philosophy.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.urbanomic.com/Publications/Collapse-3/PDFs/C3_Spec_Real.pdf Brassier, Ray, Iain Hamilton Grant, Graham Harman, and Quentin Meillassoux. 2007.

==Biography==
Harman was born in [[Iowa City]] and raised in [[Mount Vernon, Iowa]]. He received a B.A. from [[St. John's College (Annapolis/Santa Fe)|St. John's College]] in [[Annapolis, Maryland]] in 1990 and went on to graduate school at [[Penn State University]] to earn a master's degree, studying under philosopher [[Alphonso Lingis]], in 1991. While pursuing a Ph.D. at [[DePaul University]], Harman worked as an online sports reporter, an experience which he credits for developing his writing style and productivity. After finishing his degree in 1999 he joined the Department of Philosophy at the American University in Cairo, where he taught from 2000-2016 and is currently Distinguished University Professor on leave.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Paul J.

==Philosophical work==
Harman starts the development of his work with [[Martin Heidegger]]'s concept of "tool-analysis" from ''[[Being and Time]]''. To Harman, tool-analysis was a key discovery which establishes the groundwork for taking seriously the autonomous existence of objects and, in doing so, highlights deficiencies in [[phenomenology (philosophy)|phenomenology]] due to its subordination of objects to their use by or relationship with humans.

Harman is considered part of the [[speculative realism]] trend, a nebulous grouping of philosophers united by two perspectives: a rejection of [[anthropocentrism|anthropocentric]] "philosophies of access" which privilege the perspective of humans in relation to objects, and a support of [[metaphysical realism]] via rejection of "correlationism", an assumption in [[Post-Kantian philosophy]] that fellow speculative realist [[Quentin Meillassoux]] defines as "the idea according to which we only ever have access to the correlation between thinking and being, and never to either term considered apart from the other."&lt;ref&gt;Quentin Meillassoux, ''After Finitude'', 5.&lt;/ref&gt; Harman's object-oriented approach considers the life of objects to be fertile ground for a metaphysics that works to overcome anthropocentrism and correlationism.

According to Harman, everything is an object, whether it be a mailbox, a [[shadow]], [[spacetime]], a fictional character, or the [[Commonwealth of Nations]]. However, drawing on [[Phenomenology (philosophy)|phenomenology]], he does distinguish between two categories of objects: real objects and sensual objects (or [[intentional object]]s), which sets his philosophy apart from the flat ontology of [[Bruno Latour]].&lt;ref&gt;Harman, G. (2009) [http://www.re-press.org/book-files/OA_Version_780980544060_Prince_of_Networks.pdf Prince of Networks: Bruno Latour and Metaphysics. Melbourne: re.press.]&lt;/ref&gt;

Harman defines real objects as inaccessible and infinitely withdrawn from all relations and then puzzles over how such objects can be accessed or enter into relations: "by definition, there is no direct access to real objects. Real objects are incommensurable with our knowledge, untranslatable into any relational access of any sort, cognitive or otherwise. Objects can only be known indirectly. And this is not just the fate of humans — it’s the fate of everything. Fire burns cotton stupidly ..."&lt;ref name="skepoet"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://skepoet.wordpress.com/2012/06/01/marginalia-on-radical-thinking-an-interview-with-graham-harman/|title=Marginalia on Radical Thinking: An Interview with Graham Harman|date=1 June 2012|author=El Mono Liso|work=The (Dis)Loyal Opposition to Modernity}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Central to Harman's philosophy is the idea that real objects are inexhaustible: "A police officer eating a banana reduces this fruit to a present-at-hand profile of its elusive depth, as do a monkey eating the same banana, a parasite infecting it, or a gust of wind blowing it from a tree. Banana-being is a genuine reality in the world, a reality never exhausted by any relation to it by humans or other entities." (Harman 2005: 74). Because of this inexhaustibility, claims Harman, there is a metaphysical problem regarding how two objects can ever interact. His solution is to introduce the notion of "vicarious causation", according to which objects can only ever interact on the inside of an "intention" (which is also an object).&lt;ref&gt;http://faculty.virginia.edu/theorygroup/docs/harman=vicarious-causation.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

Cutting across the phenomenological tradition, and especially its [[linguistic turn]], Harman deploys a brand of metaphysical realism that attempts to extricate objects from their human captivity and metaphorically allude to a strange subterranean world of "vacuum-sealed" objects-in-themselves: "The comet itself, the monkey itself, Coca-Cola itself, resonate in cellars of being where no relation reaches."&lt;ref&gt;https://www.scribd.com/doc/27861685/Harm-an-Graham&lt;/ref&gt;

Strongly sympathetic to [[panpsychism]], Harman proposes a new philosophical discipline called "speculative psychology" dedicated to investigating the "cosmic layers of psyche" and "ferreting out the specific psychic reality of earthworms, dust, armies, chalk, and stone."&lt;ref&gt;Graham Harman, ''Prince of Networks'', 213.&lt;/ref&gt; Harman does not, however, unreservedly endorse an all-encompassing panpsychism and instead proposes a sort of 'polypsychism' that nonetheless must "balloon beyond all previous limits, but without quite extending to all entities".&lt;ref name="quadruple"&gt;Graham Harman 2011, ''The Quadruple Object''&lt;/ref&gt; He continues by stating that "perceiving" and "non-perceiving" are not different kinds of objects, but can be found in the same entity at different times:  "The important point is that objects do not perceive insofar as they exist, as panpsychism proclaims. Instead they perceive insofar as they relate."&lt;ref name="quadruple"/&gt;

Harman rejects [[scientism]] on account of its [[anthropocentrism]]: "For them, raindrops know nothing and lizards know very little, and some humans are more knowledgeable than others."&lt;ref&gt;http://ecologywithoutnature.blogspot.com/2011/10/harman-on-anthropocentrism.html&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6368">'''Gregory of Rimini''' (c. 1300 – November 1358), also called '''Gregorius de Arimino''' or '''Ariminensis''', was one of the great [[Scholasticism|scholastic philosophers]] and theologians of the [[Middle Ages]].  He was the first scholastic writer to unite the Oxonian and Parisian traditions in 14th-century philosophy, and his work had a lasting influence in the [[Late Middle Ages]] and [[Protestant Reformation|Reformation]].  His [[scholastic nickname]]s were ''Doctor acutus'' and ''Doctor authenticus''.

==Life==
Gregory was born in [[Rimini]] around 1300.  He joined the [[Hermits of Saint Augustine|Order of the Hermits of Saint Augustine]] before studying [[theology]] in the 1320s at the [[University of Paris]], where he encountered the ideas of the late [[Franciscan]] [[Peter Auriol]].  In the 1330s he taught at Augustinian schools in [[Bologna]], [[Padua]] and [[Perugia]], where he became familiar with the recent work of Oxford thinkers such as [[Adam Wodeham]], [[William Ockham]], and [[Walter Chatton]].  He returned to Paris in 1342 to prepare his lectures on [[Peter Lombard|Peter Lombard's]] [[Sentences]], which he delivered in 1342–1344.  Because of his familiarity with English philosophy during this time, he effectively transmitted contemporary Oxford ideas—with an Augustinian tinge—to Paris.  He became a Master of Theology in 1345 and subsequently taught at schools in [[Padua]] and [[Rimini]].  Gregory died in [[Vienna]] in 1358 shortly after being named General of his Order.

==Philosophy==
In his lifetime, Gregory composed a number of philosophical works including analytical tables to accompany his own lectures, tables on Saint Augustine's works, and a few governmental letters.  Yet, his most important works are the lectures on Books I and II of Peter Lombard's ''Sentences''.  (This should have been on the four books, but books III and IV seem to have been lost, or were never written).

Many later scholastics copied long passages from his works. Those who borrowed from him or were influenced by him include the [[Cistercian]] [[James of Eltville]], [[Pierre d'Ailly]], and [[Henry of Langenstein]].

===Augustinianism===
The most important influence in Gregory's thought was [[St Augustine]].  Gregory read Augustine more carefully and extensively than his predecessors, and so was able to attack [[Peter Auriol|Auriol]] for his faulty citations and quotations of Augustine, as well as for his [[Semipelagianism]].  Gregory adhered to Augustine's [[predestination]] and famously condemned unbaptised infants to [[Hell]], for which he gained the nickname ''Infantium Tortor'' (torturer, or tormentor, of infants).

===Theory of sentences===
Initially, with the intention of defining theology and natural sciences, Rimini developed a theory of sentences to describe scientific knowledge.  He believed sentences neither to be extra-mental nor [[propositional]]; in this theory, sentences signify something exclusively by the make-up of their terms, but are neither reducible to individual terms nor are "mental sentences" identifiable.  Defenders of this view claim that beliefs about the world are too complicated to correspond to specific language structures and thus, cannot serve as objects of scientific knowledge.

===Nominalism===
Gregory Rimini had a unique take on traditional [[nominalist]] views.  He thought that to contrive understanding in physical reality by incorporating abstract objects was nonsensical, due to his belief that [[mental objects]] are used strictly for convenient social conventions and nothing else.  With this divide between complex thought and physical reality, Rimini also believed statements describing infinitely many points, infinitely many lines, infinitely many planes, etc. are all false.  Since these are all mental, abstract objects, they only exist in the minds of people who think about them.  Thus, the notion of physical infinity is not applicable.  Furthermore, God was always in close relation to these abstract objects, too.  Rimini's nominalist view claims that God has the ability to distinguish abstract objects but has no need to manipulate them.  To Rimini, God has no need to manipulate mathematical propositions because he exists outside of time and thus, has no need to think deductively about the individual abstract objects anyway.

'''Henri Lambert'''  (1862–1934) was a [[Belgian people|Belgian]] [[engineer]] and [[glass works]] owner at [[Charleroi]] near [[Brussels]]. His glass works was the largest in the world in that time. He was one of the first occupied with [[social economy]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://minedhistoires-histoiredemines.posterous.com/charleroi1911-2011-colloque-interuniversitair |accessdate=March 5, 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140222040419/http://minedhistoires-histoiredemines.posterous.com/charleroi1911-2011-colloque-interuniversitair |archivedate=February 22, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; He spoke [[Walloon language|Walloon]] with his blue collar workers, which was exceptional in that time.  He was a prolific writer (in French) of articles for newspaper and political journals, brochures, and books on [[political philosophy]], and had several of his works translated into German and English. He favoured [[individualism]], [[free trade]], and [[international peace]]. He also wrote works about [[corporation]]s, [[trade union]]s, [[government]], [[democracy]], and representation, voicing bold and well-intentioned ideas (which may not be altogether consistent).  But his criticism of the principle of [[limited liability]] in connection with corporations is an original point which seems to have attracted attention at the turn of the century, as well as his ideas about the organisation of trade unions. He was called upon to address lawyers' and economists' associations and other bodies.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3216">An '''honest broker''' is an entity that keeps sets of private information but distributes parts of those sets to other entities who should not have access to the entire set. Honest brokers often work in [[clinical research]] with [[biological specimens]]; in that case, donors of specimens allow researchers to do research on those specimens, but typically want their specimen [[de-identification|de-identified]] by having [[protected health information]] separated from it. The honest broker would keep both the specimen and associated protected health information, but only allow researchers to have access to the specimen without the protected health information.

==Characteristics ==
Honest brokers are typically appointed to a research project by an [[institutional review board]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Auray-Blais | first1 = C. | last2 = Patenaude | first2 = J. | journal = BMC Medical Ethics | volume = 7 | pages = 4 | year = 2006 | doi = 10.1186/1472-6939-7-4 | pmid =  16600040|title=A biobank management model applicable to biomedical research| pmc = 1475589}}&lt;/ref&gt; They provide data from clinical and research sources for research use only and in accordance with policies that prohibit re-identification.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Dhir | first1 = R. | last2 = Patel | first2 = A.

Organizations conducting [[breast cancer]] research have identified access to biological specimens as a top priority, and therefore honest broker systems are key to research because they increase access to specimens.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Taube | first1 = S.

==Diplomacy==
In Diplomacy, an "honest broker" is an entity (individual or organisation) that is accepted by all sides in a negotiation as impartial. Neutrality does not equal an absence of interest; rather, the interest of the honest broker lies in a solution, without preference for either party involved in the conflict.

German Chancellor [[Otto von Bismarck]] was the first to use the term (applied to himself) in connection with the 1878 [[Congress of Berlin]].&lt;ref name="washingtoninstitute.org"&gt;The Washington Institute for Near East Policy: [http://www.washingtoninstitute.org/policy-analysis/view/the-united-states-as-an-honest-broker The United States as an Honest Broker - The Washington Institute for Near East Policy], accessdate: May 30, 2018&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="49638">The '''Hopi time controversy''' is the academic debate about how the [[Hopi language]] grammaticalizes the concept of time, and about whether the differences between the ways the English and Hopi languages describe time are an example of [[linguistic relativity]] or not. In popular discourse the debate is often framed as a question about whether the [[Hopi people|Hopi]] "had a concept of time", despite it now being well established that they do.

The debate originated in the 1940s when American linguist [[Benjamin Lee Whorf]] argued that the Hopi conceptualized time differently from the [[Standard Average European]] speaker, and that this difference correlated with grammatical differences between the languages.{{sfn|Carroll|1956}} Whorf argued that Hopi has "no words, grammatical forms, construction or expressions that refer directly to what we call 'time'", and concluded that the Hopi had "no general notion or intuition of time as a smooth flowing continuum in which everything in the universe proceeds at equal rate, out of a future, through the present, into a past".{{sfn|Whorf|1956b|p=57}} Whorf used the Hopi concept of time as a primary example of his concept of linguistic relativity, which posits that the way in which individual languages encode information about the world, influences and correlates with the cultural [[world view]] of the speakers.  Whorf's relativist views fell out of favor in [[linguistics]] and [[anthropology]] in the 1960s, but Whorf's statement lived on in the popular literature often in the form of an [[urban myth]] that "the Hopi have no concept of time". In 1983 linguist [[Ekkehart Malotki]] published a 600-page study of the [[grammatical tense|grammar of time]] in the Hopi language, concluding that he had finally refuted Whorf's claims about the language.{{sfn|Malotki|1983}} Malotki's treatise gave hundreds of examples of Hopi words and grammatical forms referring to temporal relations. Malotki's central claim was that the Hopi do indeed conceptualize time as structured in terms of an ego-centered spatial progression from past, through present into the future. He also demonstrated that the Hopi language grammaticalizes tense using a distinction between future and non-future tenses, as opposed to the English tense system, which is usually analyzed as being based on a past/non-past distinction. Many took Malotki's work as a definitive refutation of the linguistic relativity hypothesis.{{sfn|Dinwoodie|2006}} Linguist and specialist in the linguistic typology of tense [[Bernard Comrie]] concluded that "Malotki's presentation and argumentation are devastating".{{sfn|Comrie|1984|p=132}} Psychologist [[Steven Pinker]], a well-known critic of Whorf and the concept of linguistic relativity, accepted Malotki's claims as having demonstrated Whorf's complete ineptitude as a linguist.{{sfn|Pinker|1994|p=63}}

Subsequently the study of linguistic relativity was revived using new approaches in the 1990s,{{sfn|Leavitt|2011}}{{sfn|Reines|Prinze|2009}} and Malotki's study came under criticism from relativist linguists and anthropologists, who did not consider that the study invalidated Whorf's claims.{{sfn|Dinwoodie|2006}}{{sfn|Lee|1996}}{{sfn|Lee|1991}}{{sfn|Leavitt|2011|p=180-88}} The main issue of contention is the interpretation of Whorf's original claims about Hopi, and what exactly it was that he was claiming made Hopi different from what Whorf called "[[Standard Average European]]" languages.{{sfn|Leavitt|2011}} Some consider that the Hopi language may be best described as a [[tenseless language]], and that the distinction between non-future and future posited by Malotki may be better understood as a distinction between ''realis'' and ''irrealis'' [[grammatical mood|moods]].{{sfn|Comrie|1984}} Regardless of exactly how the Hopi concept of time is best analyzed, most specialists agree with Malotki that all humans conceptualize time by an analogy with space, although some recent studies have also questioned this.{{sfn|Evans|2004}}{{sfn|Sinha|Sinha|Zinken|Sampaio|2011}}

==The Hopi language==
The [[Hopi language]] is a [[Indigenous languages of the Americas|Native American language]] of the [[Uto-Aztecan languages|Uto-Aztecan language family]], which is spoken by some 5,000 [[Hopi people]] in the [[Hopi Reservation]] in Northeastern [[Arizona]], US.

In the large ''[[Hopi Dictionary: Hopìikwa Lavàytutuveni|Hopi dictionary]]'' there is no word exactly corresponding to the English noun "time". Hopi employs different words to refer to "a duration of time" (''pàasa''' "for that long"), to a point in time (''pàasat'' "at that time"), and time as measured by a clock (''pahàntawa''), as an occasion to do something (''hisat'' or ''qeni''), a turn or the appropriate time for doing something (''qeniptsi'' (noun)), and to have time for something (''aw nánaptsiwta'' (verb)).{{sfn|Hopi Dictionary Project|1998|p=854}}

Time reference can be marked on verbs using the suffix ''-ni''
:''Momoyam piktota'' "The women are/were making ''[[piki]]''"
: Women piki-make
:''Momoyam piktota-ni''''' "The women will be making ''piki''"{{sfn|Hopi Dictionary Project|1998|p=878}}
:Women piki-make-NI

The -ni suffix is also used in the word ''naato'''ni'''qa'' which means "that which will happen yet" in reference to the future. This word is formed from the adverb ''naato'' "yet", the ''-ni'' suffix and the clitic -qa that forms a [[relative clause]] with the meaning "that which...".{{sfn|Hopi Dictionary Project|1998|p=281}}

The -''ni'' suffix is also obligatory on the main verb in [[Conditional mood|conditional]] clauses:{{sfn|Kalectaca|1978|p=155}}

:''Kur nu' pam tuwa nu' wuuvata-ni''''' "if I see him I'll run away"{{sfn|Kalectaca|1978|p=155}}
:If I him see I run-NI

The suffix is also used in conditional{{sfn|Kalectaca|1978|p=157}} clauses referring to a past context then often combined with the particle ''as'' that carries past tense or [[Counterfactual thinking|counterfactual]] meaning, or describes unachieved intent:{{sfn|Kalectaca|1978|p=143}}
:''Pam nuy tuwáq nu' so'on as wayaa'''ni''''' "If he had seen me I wouldn't have run"{{sfn|Kalectaca|1978|p=157}}
:he me see I Neg Past/Counterfact. run-NI

:''Nu' sayti'''ni''''' "I will smile"{{sfn|Kalectaca|1978|p=143}}
:I smile-NI

:''Nu' as sayti'''ni''''' "I tried to smile/I should smile/I wanted to smile/I was going to smile"{{sfn|Kalectaca|1978|p=143}}
:I Past/Counterfact. smile

The suffix ''-ngwu'' describes actions taking place habitually or as a general rule.
:''Tömö' taawa tatkyaqw yáma'''ngwu''''' "In the winter the sun rises in the southeast"{{sfn|Hopi Dictionary Project|1998|p=878}}

==Benjamin Lee Whorf==
Benjamin Lee Whorf (1897–1941), a fire prevention engineer by profession, studied Native American linguistics from an early age. He corresponded with many of the greatest scholars of his time, such as [[Alfred Tozzer]] at Harvard and Herbert Spinden of the American Museum of Natural History. They were impressed with his work on the linguistics of the [[Nahuatl language]] and encouraged him to participate professionally and to undertake field research in Mexico. In 1931 [[Edward Sapir]], the foremost expert on Native American languages, started teaching at [[Yale University|Yale]], close to where Whorf lived, and Whorf signed up for graduate-level classes with Sapir, becoming one of his most respected students.{{sfn|Carroll|1956|p=''passim''}} Whorf took a special interest in the [[Hopi language]] and started working with Ernest Naquayouma, a speaker of Hopi from Toreva village on the [[Second Mesa]] of the [[Hopi Reservation]] in [[Arizona]], who was living in the [[Manhattan]] borough of New York City. At this time it was common for linguists to base their descriptions of a language on data from a single speaker. Whorf credited Naquayouma as the source of most of his information on the Hopi language, although in 1938 he took a short field trip to the village of Mishongnovi on the [[Second Mesa]], collecting some additional data.&lt;ref name="Dinwoodie"&gt;{{harvcoltxt|Dinwoodie|2006|p=346}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Whorf published several articles on Hopi grammar, focusing particularly on the ways in which the grammatical categories of Hopi encoded information about events and processes, and how this correlated with aspects of Hopi culture and behavior. After his death his full sketch of Hopi grammar was published by his friend the linguist [[Harry Hoijer]], and some essays on Native American linguistics, many of which had been previously published in academic journals, were published in 1956 in the anthology ''Language, Thought, and Reality'' by his friend psychologist [[John Bissell Carroll]].{{sfn|Carroll|1956}}

===Whorf on Hopi time===
Whorf's most frequently cited statement regarding Hopi time is the strongly worded introduction of his 1936 paper "An American Indian model of the Universe", which was first published posthumously in Carroll's edited volume. Here he writes that

{{quote|I find it gratuitous to assume that a Hopi who knows only the Hopi language and the cultural ideas of his own society has the same notions, often supposed to be intuitions, of time and space as we have, and that are generally assumed to be universal. In particular he has no notion or intuition of {{Smallcaps|time}} as a smooth flowing continuum in which everything in the universe proceeds at an equal rate, out of a future into a present and into a past&amp;nbsp;.... After a long and careful analysis the Hopi language is seen to contain no words, grammatical forms, construction or expressions that refer directly to what we call 'time', or to past, present or future ...|{{harvcoltxt|Whorf|1956b|p=57}}}}

Whorf argues that in Hopi units of time are not represented by nouns, but by adverbs or verbs. Whorf argues that all Hopi nouns include the notion of a boundary or outline, and that consequently the Hopi language does not refer to abstract concepts with nouns. This, Whorf argues, is encoded in Hopi grammar, which does not allow durations of time to be counted in the same way objects are. So instead of saying, for example, "three days", Hopi would say the equivalent of "on the third day", using ordinal numbers. Whorf argues that the Hopi do not consider the process of time passing to produce another new day, but merely as bringing back the daylight aspect of the world.{{sfn|Whorf|1956e|pp=148-52}}

====Hopi as a tenseless language====
Whorf gives slightly different analyses of the grammatical encoding of time in Hopi in his different writings. His first published writing on Hopi grammar was the paper "The punctual and segmentative aspects of verbs in Hopi", published in 1936 in ''[[Language (journal)|Language]]'', the journal of the [[Linguistic Society of America]].{{sfn|Whorf|1956a}} Here Whorf analyzed Hopi as having a tense system with a distinction between three tenses: one used for past or present events (which Whorf calls the ''Factual'' tense or ''present-past''); one for future events; and one for events that are generally or universally true (here called ''usitative''). This analysis was repeated in a 1937 letter to J. B. Carroll, who later published it as part of his selected writings under the title "Discussion of Hopi Linguistics".{{sfn|Whorf|1956c|p=103|quote="There are three tenses: past (i.e. past up to and including the present), future and generalized (that which is generally, universally or timelessly true), all of which are mutually exclusive"}}

In the 1938 paper "Some verbal categories of Hopi", also published in ''Language'', Whorf abandoned the word "tense" in the description of Hopi and described the distinction previously called "tense" with the label "assertions". Whorf described assertions as a system of categories that describe the speaker's claim of [[epistemic]] validity of his own statement. The three "assertions" of Hopi described by Whorf are the ''Reportive'', ''Expective'' and ''Nomic'' forms of the Hopi verb. Whorf acknowledges that these "translate more or less [as] the English tenses", but maintains that these forms do not refer to time or duration, but rather to the speaker's claim of the validity of the statement.{{sfn|Whorf|1938|p=276|quote="What we call present tense (not counting our present form which corresponds to the nomic) is from the Hopi standpoint simply a report to others concerning a situation shared with them, this report being either redundant information, or used to call attention to, or tell about some fragment of the situation not fully shared. Thus to the Hopi 'he is running'
need not be different from 'he was running', for if both the speaker and listener can see the runner then the 'is' of the former sentence means merely that the listener can see for himself what he is being told; he is being given redundant information, and this is the only difference from the latter sentence."}} The reportive form is unmarked, whereas the expective form is marked with the verbal suffix ''-ni'', and the nomic form with the suffix ''-ŋʷi''. In Whorf's analysis, by using the reportive form the speaker claims that the event has in fact occurred or is still occurring, whereas by using the expective form the speaker describes an expectation of a future event. Whorf says that the expective can be used to describe events in the past, giving the meaning of "was going to" or "would".{{sfn|Whorf|1938|pp=276-278}}

In the 1940 article "Science and Linguistics", Whorf gave the same three-way classification based on the speaker's assertion of the validity of his statement: "The timeless Hopi verb does not distinguish between the present, past and future of the event itself but must always indicate what type of validity the {{smallcaps|speaker}} intends the statement to have: a. report of an event .. b. expectation of an event ..; generalization or law about events."{{sfn|Whorf|1956f|p=217}}

In his full sketch of Hopi grammar published posthumously in 1946, Whorf also described how adverbial particles contributed to the linguistic description of time in Hopi.{{sfn|Whorf|1946}} He posited two subclasses of adverbs called ''temporals'' and ''tensors'', which were used in sentences to locate events in time. A central claim in Whorf's work on linguistic relativity was that for the Hopi units of time were not considered objects that can be counted like most of the comparable English words that are described by [[noun]]s (''a day'', ''an hour'' etc.). He argued that only the Hopi word for "year" was a noun, the words for days and nights were ambivalent between noun and verbs, but that all other cyclic events and periods were described by adverbial particles used as modifiers for the sentence {{sfn|Whorf|1946|p=165|quote="Names of cyclic events and time periods, like summer, morning, full moon are in the class of temporals, a kind of adverbs. They mean e.g. "when it is summer" and are used to qualify predicates. They are not used as subjects, objects or at all as nouns."}}
&lt;!--(temporals and tensors are a subclass of the analytic word class (adverbial particles))
aspect (Add to this that these aspects may compound together, and that all but the durative and continuative handle ideas that are utterly strange, to English or indeed Indo-European...{{sfn|Whorf|1946|p=175}}): ingressive punctual or punctualizing (moment of completion, passage from latency into manifestation), and tensive or tensivizing, durative, segmentative (repeating), --&gt;

===Whorf's inspiration from Einsteinian physics===
In his interpretation of Hopi time Whorf was influenced by [[Einstein]]'s theory of relativity, which was developed in the first decades of the century and impacted the general Zeitgeist.&lt;ref&gt;Frank Heynick 1983 "From Einstein to Whorf: space, time, matter and reference frames in physical and linguistic relativity." Semiotica, 45 (1-2).&lt;/ref&gt;  Whorf, an engineer by profession, in fact made occasional reference to physical relativity, and he adopted the term "linguistic relativity," reflecting the general concept of the different but equally valid interpretations of some aspects of physical reality by different observers due to differences in their (for Einstein) physical circumstances or (for Whorf) their psychological-linguistic circumstances.

The most salient points involve the concepts of ''simultaneity'' and ''spacetime''. In his [[Annus Mirabilis Papers#Special relativity|1905 Special Relativity]] paper, Einstein maintained that two given events can legitimately be called simultaneous if and only if they take place at the same point in time '''and''' in the same point in space. No two events which take place at a spatial distance from one another can legitimately be declared to be simultaneous in any absolute sense, for the judgement of simultaneity or non-simultaneity will depend on the physical circumstances (to be exact: the relative motion) of the observers. This difference is no artifact; each of the observers is correct (and is wrong only to the extent he or she insists that another observer is incorrect).

[[Hermann Minkowski]], in his seminal 1908 address to the Congress of German Physicists, translated Einstein's 1905 mathematical equations into geometric terms. Minkowski famously declared:

&lt;blockquote&gt;"Henceforth space by itself, and time by itself, are doomed to fade away into mere shadows, and only a kind of union of the two will preserve an independent reality."&lt;ref&gt;Quoted in Heynick 1983, p.43.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Spatial distance and temporal distance between any two events was now replaced by a single absolute distance in spacetime.

Heynick points to several passages in Whorf's writings on the Hopis which parallel Einsteinian concepts such as:

&lt;blockquote&gt;"time varies with each observer and does not permit of simultaneity" (1940)&lt;ref&gt;Quoted in Heynick 1983, p.42.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;"The Hopi metaphysics does not raise the question whether the things at a distant village exist at the same moment as those in one's own village, for it ... says that any 'events' in the distant village can be compared to any events in one's own village only by an interval of magnitude that has both time and space forms in it." (c.1936) &lt;ref&gt;Quoted in Heynick 1983, p.42. Heynick is careful to point out that he has selectively cited such passages and that in the broader context of Whorf's writing it would be inaccurate to assume that Whorf simply presents the Hopis as pre-Einstein Einsteins in their conception of time.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The concept of a "simultaneous now" throughout the cosmos was formulated by [[Aristotle]], [[Isaac Newton|Newton]], and most succinctly in [[John Locke]]'s ''Essay Concerning Human Understanding'' (1690):

&lt;blockquote&gt;"For this moment is common to all things that are now in being ... they all exist in the same moment of time."&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Whorf saw this notion as derived from the Standard Average European languages in which these thinkers thought: "Newtonian space, time, and matter are no intuitions. They are recepts from culture and language. That is where Newton got them."&lt;ref&gt;Quoted in Heynick 1983, p.46.&lt;/ref&gt;

Heynick, who claimed no personal knowledge of the Hopi language, posits alternative weaker and stronger interpretations of the influence of Einsteinian relativity on Whorf's analysis of the Hopi language and the Hopi concept of time. In the weaker version, the (then) new questioning of the nature of time and space brought about by the Einsteinian revolution in physics enabled Whorf to approach the Hopis and their language unburdened by traditional Western concepts and presumptions. The stronger version is that Whorf under the influence of Einstein tended inadvertently to "read into" his linguistic and cultural data relativistic concepts where they perhaps were not.&lt;ref&gt;Heynick also analyzes Whorf's concepts of "eventing" and the nature of matter in the language of the Hopis (and the Nooktas), and their parallels in modern physics. These relate only peripherally to the Hopi time controversy.&lt;/ref&gt;

==The myth of the timeless Hopi==
Whorf died in 1941, but his ideas took on their own life in academia and in the popular discourse on Native Americans. In 1958 [[Stuart Chase]]—an economist and engineer at MIT who had followed Whorf's ideas with great interest, but whom Whorf himself considered utterly incompetent and incapable of understanding the nuances of his ideas{{sfn|Lee|1996|p=16}}—published "Some things worth knowing: a generalist's guide to useful knowledge". Here he repeated Whorf's claim about Hopi time, but arguing that because of the Hopi view of time as a process, they were better able to understand the concept of time as a [[Four-dimensional space|fourth dimension]].{{sfn|Deutscher|2010|p=141-43}} Similarly, even scientists were intrigued by the thought that the idea of spatio-temporal unity that had taken [[Albert Einstein]] seven years to ponder, was readily available to the Hopi, simply because of the grammar of their language.{{sfn|Livingston|1963|p=16}}

In 1964 [[John Greenway (folklorist)|John Greenway]] published a humorous portrait of American culture, ''The Inevitable Americans'', in which he wrote: "You have a watch, because Americans are obsessed with time. If you were a Hopi Indian, you would have none, the Hopi have no concept of time".{{sfn|Greenway|1964|p=9}} And even the 1971 ethnography of the Hopi by Euler and Dobyns claimed that "The English concept of time is nearly incomprehensible to the Hopi".{{sfn|Euler|Dobyns|1971|p=21}} The myth quickly became a staple element of [[New Age]] conceptualizations of the Hopi.{{sfn|Geertz|1994}}

==Max Black and Helmut Gipper==
In 1959 philosopher [[Max Black]] published a critique of Whorf's arguments in which he argued that the principle of linguistic relativity was obviously wrong because translation between languages is always possible, even when there are no exact correspondences between the single words or concepts in the two languages.{{sfn|Black|1959}}

German linguist and philosopher Helmut Gipper had studied with the neo-[[Wilhelm von Humboldt|Humboldtian]] linguist [[Leo Weisgerber]] and had a basically Kantian understanding of the relation between language and thought. [[Immanuel Kant]] considered the categories of time and space to be universals underlying all human thinking.{{sfn|Leavitt|2011|pp=179-180, 186-87}} Whorf's argument that the Hopi do not conceive of time and space as speakers of [[Indo-European languages]] do clashed with this basic understanding of cognition. Gipper went to the Hopi reservation to collect data for a general critique of Whorf's principle of linguistic relativity published in 1972. His critique included a refutation of Whorf's Hopi arguments. Gipper showed that the Hopi could refer to time, by juxtaposing Hopi phrases with their German equivalents that used words referring to units of time and to distinctions between past and present. Gipper also argued that several time intervals were described by nouns, and that these nouns could take the role of syntactic subject or object, in contradiction of Whorf's explicit statement. He argues that Whorf's assertion that intervals of time are not counted in the same way as objects is "questionable".{{sfn|Gipper|1972}}

==Ekkehart Malotki==
[[Ekkehart Malotki]] studied with Gipper at the [[University of Münster|Westfälische Wilhelms-Universität]] at [[Münster]] and his work was a continuation of his mentor's, spurred on by the frequent claims in the popular literature that "the Hopi have no concept of time". Malotki conducted four years of research on the [[Third Mesa]], studying Hopi spatial and temporal reference. He published two large volumes, one in German, ''Hopi-Raum''{{sfn|Malotki|1979}} [Hopi space] and one in English, ''Hopi Time''.{{sfn|Malotki|1983}} For Malotki it was imperative to demonstrate two facts in contradiction of Whorf's claims: 1. that the Hopi language has an abundance of terms, words and constructions that refer to time. 2. that the Hopi do cognitively conceptualize time in analogy with physical space, using spatial metaphors to describe durations and units of time. He also wanted to demonstrate that Whorf misanalyzed several particularities regarding specific Hopi words and expressions. Malotki states that a main goal is to present "actual Hopi language data", since when he was writing very little textual data in Hopi had been published, and Whorf's publications were largely without text examples.{{sfn|Malotki|1983|p=629}}

===''Hopi Time'' (1983)===
Most of ''Hopi Time'' is dedicated to the detailed description of the Hopi usage of words and constructions related to time. Malotki describes in detail the usage of a large amount of linguistic material:  temporal adverbs, time units, time counting practices such as the Hopi calendar, the way that days are counted and time is measured.

The first part of the book describes "spatio-temporal metaphors"; in it he shows several deictic adverbs that are used both to reference distance in space and in time, such as the word ''ep'' that means both "there" and "then". In the second chapter he describes the way in which the Hopi talk about units of time. He argues that in some contexts, specifically those of the ceremonial cycle, the Hopi do count days, using compound words such as ''payistala'' "the third day (of a ceremony)" composed of the morphemes ''paayo'' "three", ''s'' "times" and ''taala''' "day/light", meaning literally "three-times-day".{{sfn|Malotki|1983|p=246}} He also shows that the Hopi reckon time through the movement of the sun, having distinct words for the different degrees of light during the dawn and dusk periods. He also notes that the feeling of time passing can be described by saying "the sun moves slowly/quickly". Parts 3, 4, 5, and 6 describe Hopi time-keeping practices using the sun relative to the horizon, using the stars, the ceremonial calendar and the use of time-keeping devices such as knotted strings or notched sticks with a mark or knot for every day, sun-hole alignment and shadow observation. The eighth chapter describes the temporal particles that Whorf defined as temporals and tensors. He argues that Whorf's descriptions are vague and alienating.{{sfn|Malotki|1983|p=531}}

====Malotki on tense in Hopi====
The concept of Hopi tense is covered in the last part of chapter 9, titled "miscellaneous", and in the conclusion. Malotki follows Gipper in arguing that time is a natural category and that it is naturally experienced in terms of past, present and future, even though many languages do not necessarily grammaticalize all of these distinctions.{{sfn|Malotki|1983|p=625}} He analyzes the Hopi ''-ni'' suffix as marking the future tense. He argues that since there is no grammatical distinction between past and present, Hopi has a future-nonfuture tense system. Malotki distinguishes between primary and secondary functions of the -ni suffix, arguing that its primary function is temporal reference and that its many modal functions such as [[imperative mood|imperative]], [[hortative]] and [[desiderative]] are of secondary importance. {{quote|text=As it turns out from among the numerous suffixes that the Hopi verb can select to mark the grammatical categories of aspect, mode and tense, one is specifically reserved to refer to time, or rather the sequential ordering of events or states. This temporal marker is ''-ni'' whose referential force is futurity. Its temporal function is primary; however, in many contexts i-''ni'' also takes on a number of secondary, atemporal functions which essentially belong to the modal category (imperative, hortative, desiderative, etc.). Since no markers exist to point out present or past time, Hopi, like many other languages, can be said to be endowed with a future-nonfuture tense system.{{sfn|Malotki|1983|p=624}}}} Malotki does admit that the English and Hopi systems of tense are different since the English system distinguishes past from non-past, whereas Hopi distinguishes future from non-future.{{sfn|Malotki|1983|p=666}}

==Further debates==
Subsequent descriptions of Hopi grammar have maintained Malotki's distinction between an unmarked non-future tense and a future tense marked with the -''ni'' suffix, and a habitual aspect marked by the suffix -''ngwu''.{{sfn|Hopi Dictionary Project|1998|p=878}} The review by [[Bernard Comrie]], a well-known authority on the [[linguistic typology]] of [[grammatical tense|tense]] and [[grammatical aspect|aspect]], accepts that Malotki's work demonstrates that the Hopi do have a concept of time and that it is devastating for Whorf's strong claims. But Comrie also notes that Malotki's "Claim that Hopi has a tense system based on the opposition of future and non-future&amp;nbsp;... strikes me as questionable: given the wide range of modal uses of the so-called future, it is at least plausible that this is a modal rather than temporal distinction, with the result that Hopi would have no tense distinction."{{sfn|Comrie|1984|p=132}}

Linguists and psychologists who work in the universalist tradition such as [[Steven Pinker]] and [[John McWhorter]], have seen Malotki's study as being the final proof that Whorf was an inept linguist and had no significant knowledge or understanding of the Hopi language.{{sfn|Pinker|1994}}{{sfn|Pinker|2007}}{{sfn|McWhorter|2009}}{{sfn|McWhorter|2010}} This interpretation has been criticized by relativist scholars as unfounded and based on a lack of knowledge of Whorf's work.{{sfn|Leavitt|2011}}{{sfn|Lee|1996}}

In spite of Malotki's refutation, the myth that "the Hopi have no concept of time" lived on in the popular literature. For example, in her 1989 novel ''[[Sexing the Cherry]]'', [[Jeanette Winterson]] wrote of the Hopi: "...their language has no grammar in the way we recognize it. And most bizarre of all, they have no tenses for past, present and future. They do not sense time in that way. For them time is one."{{sfn|Winterson|1989|p=140}} And the myth continues to be an integral part of [[New Age]] thinking that draws on stereotypical depictions of "timeless Hopi culture".{{sfn|Geertz|1994}}&lt;ref&gt;See for example {{harvcoltxt|Braden|2009}}; {{harvcoltxt|Griscom|1988}}; {{harvcoltxt|Pinchbeck|2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some linguists working on Universals of [[semantics]], such as [[Anna Wierzbicka]] and [[Cliff Goddard]], argue that there is a [[Natural Semantic Metalanguage]] that has a basic vocabulary of semantic ''primes'' including concepts such as {{smallcaps|time, when, before, after}}. They have argued that Malotki's data show that the Hopi share these primes with English and all other languages, even though it is also clear that the precise way in which these concepts fit into the larger pattern of culture and language practices is different in each language, as illustrated by the differences between Hopi and English.{{sfn|Goddard|Wierzbicka|2002|pp=18-19}}

Malotki's work has been criticized by relativist scholars for failing to engage with Whorf's actual argument. [[John A. Lucy]] argues that Malotki's critique misses the fact that Whorf's point was exactly that the way in which the Hopi language grammatically structurates the representation of time leads to a different conception of time than the English one, not that they do not have one.{{sfn|Lucy|1996}} Lucy notes that when Whorf makes his strong claim about what it is that Hopi lacks, he consistently puts the word "time" in scare quotes, and uses the qualifier "what we call".{{sfn|Lucy1992b|p=286}} Lucy and others take this as evidence that Whorf was implying specifically that what the Hopi lacked was a concept that corresponds entirely to that denoted by the English word, i.e. he was making a point of showing that the concepts of time were different. Malotki himself acknowledges that the conceptualizations are different, but because he ignores Whorf's use of scare quotes, takes Whorf to be arguing that the Hopi have no concept of time at all.{{sfn|Leavitt|2011|p=180}}{{sfn|Levinson|2012|p=xii}}

In 1991 Penny Lee published a comparison of Malotki and Whorf's analyses of the adverbial word class that Whorf had called "tensors". She argues that Whorf's analysis captured aspects of Hopi grammar that were not captured by simply describing tensors as falling within the class of temporal adverbs.{{sfn|Lee|1991}}

In 2006 anthropologist [[David Dinwoodie]] published a severe critique of Malotki's work, questioning his methods and his presentation of data as well as his analysis. Dinwoodie argues that Malotki fails to adequately support his claim of having demonstrated that the Hopi have a concept of time "as we know it".{{sfn|Dinwoodie|2006|p=341}} He provides ethnographic examples of how some Hopi speakers explain the way they experience the difference between a traditional Hopi way of experiencing time as tied closely to cycles of ritual and natural events, and the Anglo-American concept of clock-time or school-time.{{sfn|Dinwoodie|2006}}

===Language, time and cognition===
Sparked by the Hopi debate about time a number of studies about how different languages grammaticalize tense and conceptualize time have been carried out. Some of these studies in [[psycholinguistics]] and [[cognitive linguistics]] have found some evidence that there may be significant differences in how speakers of different languages conceptualize time, although not necessarily in the way Whorf claimed for the Hopi. Specifically, it has been shown that some cultural groups conceptualize the flow of time in a direction opposite to what is usual for speakers of English and other [[Indo-European languages]], i.e. that the future is in front of the speaker and the past behind.{{sfn|Núñez|Sweetser|2006}}{{sfn|Dahl|1995}} It has also been found that not all languages have a grammatical category of tense: some instead use combinations of adverbs and grammatical aspect to locate events in time.{{sfn|Bittner|2005}}{{sfn|Smith|2008}}{{sfn|Tonhauser|2011}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3230">'''Hypostatic abstraction''' in [[mathematical logic]], also known as '''hypostasis''' or '''subjectal abstraction''', is a [[formal calculation|formal operation]] that transforms a [[Predicate (mathematical logic)|predicate]] into a [[Relation (philosophy)|relation]]; for example "Honey ''is'' sweet" is transformed into "Honey ''has'' sweetness". The relation is created between the original subject and a new term that represents the [[Property (philosophy)|property]] expressed by the original predicate.

Hypostasis changes a [[propositional formula]] of the form ''X is Y'' to another one of the form ''X has the property of being Y'' or ''X has Y-ness''. The logical functioning of the second object ''Y-ness'' consists solely in the truth-values of those propositions that have the corresponding abstract property ''Y'' as the predicate.  The object of thought introduced in this way may be called a ''hypostatic object'' and in some senses an ''[[abstract object]]'' and a ''formal object''.

The above definition is adapted from the one given by [[Charles Sanders Peirce]] (CP 4.235, "The Simplest Mathematics" (1902), in ''Collected Papers'', CP 4.227–323). As Peirce describes it, the main point about the formal operation of hypostatic abstraction, insofar as it operates on formal linguistic expressions, is that it converts an adjective or predicate into an extra subject, thus increasing by one the number of "subject" slots—called the ''[[arity]]'' or ''adicity''—of the main predicate.

The transformation of "honey is sweet" into "honey possesses sweetness" can be viewed in several ways:

[[Image:Hypostasis-diagram.png|400px]]

The grammatical trace of this hypostatic transformation is a process that extracts the adjective "sweet" from the predicate "is sweet", replacing it by a new, increased-arity predicate "possesses", and as a by-product of the reaction, as it were, precipitating out the substantive "sweetness" as a second subject of the new predicate.

The abstraction of hypostasis takes the concrete physical sense of "taste" found in "honey is sweet" and gives it formal [[metaphysical]] characteristics in "honey has sweetness".

The '''Institute for the Study of Christianity in an Age of Science and Technology''' (ISCAST) is a non-profit organization founded in [[Australia]] which studies issues related to [[science]] and [[faith]] within a [[Christian]] context, including [[theology]], [[evolution]] and creation, [[philosophy of science]], modern [[physics]] and [[cosmology]], [[ethics]] and [[Environmentalism|environmental]] issues.

ISCAST runs regular lectures, meetings and workshops that explore issues related to [[science]] and [[faith]], and publishes peer-reviewed articles, papers, debates and book reviews on topics of interest to its membership and the wider [[Christian]] and [[scientific]] community.

The '''Aims of ISCAST''' are: &lt;ref&gt;"ISCAST official website - 'Who Are We' section."&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
'''1.''' ''To promote an understanding of science, technology and the Christian faith which is consistent with the Judaeo-Christian doctrine of Creation, with its emphasis on God as the God of nature.''
&lt;br&gt;
'''2.''' ''To promote scholarship, teaching and discussion in this area.''
&lt;br&gt;
'''3.''' ''To engage in debate on the public understanding of science, technological development and application, and religion in order to inform the Christian church, its members and associated organisations, and to bring informed opinion to the public arena - engaging in public debate in the media and in other secular institutions.''

'''Jacques Barbeu-Dubourg''' (12 February 1709 – 14 December 1779) was a French physician, botanist, writer, translator and publisher known for translating [[Benjamin Franklin]]'s work into French and for inventing a gentlemen's umbrella fitted with a [[lightning conductor]].&lt;ref name="ima"/&gt; He designed a method of histographic visualizations which he called the ''Carte chronographique''.

==Life==
He first embarked on theological studies, but abandoned this to devote his life to science.&lt;ref name="gazettes18e"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://dictionnaire-journalistes.gazettes18e.fr/journaliste/029-jacques-barbeu-du-bourg |title=Dictionnaire des journalistes (1600-1789), 029 Jacques BARBEU DU BOURG (1709-1779) |publisher=dictionnaire-journalistes.gazettes18e.fr|accessdate=2015-04-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; He studied medicine in Paris and obtained a doctorate in 1748.&lt;ref name="fr"/&gt;

He was a keen follower of the work of Benjamin Franklin, and they maintained a regular friendly correspondence. He translated some of Franklin's early experimental work into French in 1762 and published it in ''Gazette d'Epidaure'', his medical journal.&lt;ref name="sci"/&gt; He went on to publish his French translation of Franklin's ''Observations and Experiments'' in 1773.&lt;ref name="ima"/&gt; Barbeu-Dubourg's "umbrella-lightning rod", an umbrella fitted with a tall spike and trailing chain, was designed to give the same protection for gentlemen as was sought by ladies of the time who wore lightning conductors on their hats.&lt;ref name="rdi"/&gt;

Barbeu-Dubourg was a member of the Royal Society of Medicine in Paris, the [[Medical Society of London]] and the [[American Philosophical Society]] of Philadelphia.&lt;ref name="sci"/&gt; He wrote numerous books and papers, including:
*''Chronographie, ou Description des tems, contenant toute la suite des souverains de l'univers et des principaux événements de chaque siècle...'' (Paris, 1753), one of the most ambitious of the chronographic charts produced during that period. The chart was 54 feet long, and mounted on an apparatus with scrolls and cranks to allow the reader to move freely through world history, a device which Barbeu-Dubourg called a "chronographic machine".&lt;ref name="RosenbergGrafton2010"/&gt;
*''Gazette d'Épidaure, ou Recueil de nouvelles de médecine avec des réflexions pour simplifier la théorie et éclairer la pratique'' (Paris, 1762)
*''''Le Botaniste françois, comprenant toutes les plantes communes et usuelles...'' (two volumes, Paris, 1767)&lt;ref name="Barbeu-Dubourg1767"/&gt;
*''Petit Code de la raison humaine, ou Exposition succincte de ce que la raison dicte à tous les hommes pour éclairer leur conduite et assurer leur bonheur'' (Paris, 1789)&lt;ref name="Barbeu-Dubourg1789"/&gt;

During the [[American Revolution]] the French government appointed Barbeu-Dubourg to act as secret intermediary to offer support to the Americans, but he was soon deemed unsuitable for the task and replaced by [[Beaumarchais]]. As Streeter Bass recounts, "He was too old, he lacked business acumen, and – more serious in a venture of this nature – he was insecure and garrulous."&lt;ref name="cia"/&gt;

Barbeu-Dubourg wrote the article ″Chronologique″ for the [[Encyclopédie]] of [[Denis Diderot]] and [[Jean le Rond d'Alembert]].&lt;ref name="princeton"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.princeton.edu/~ferguson/PULC_1991_duBourg.pdf |author=Stephen Ferguson|title=The 1753 Carte chronographique of Jacques Barbeu-Dubourg |publisher=princeton.edu|accessdate=2015-04-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He died in 1779 in Paris and his ashes were buried in the chapel of Saint-Symphorien church in [[Saint-Germain-des-Prés]].

==Carte chronographique==
The ''Chronographie universelle &amp; details qui en dependent pour la Chronologie &amp; les Genealogies'' abbreviated to Carte chronographique was the first [[Synchronoptic view|synchronoptical]] visualisation which attempted to map world history from the [[Garden of Eden]] to the [[Age of Enlightenment]].&lt;ref name=SB&gt;{{cite web|last1=Schmidt-Burkhardt|first1=Astrit|title=Learning in the Age of Enlightenment|url=http://georgemaciunas.com/exhibitions/knowledge-as-art-chance-computability-and-improving-education-thomas-bayes-alan-turing-george-maciunas/george-maciunas/maciunas-learning-machine-learning-in-the-age-of-enlightenment-by-astrit-schmidt-burkhardt/|website=http://georgemaciunas.com/|publisher=George Maciunas Foundation Inc.|accessdate=2015-10-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Jan Hus Presby plaque jeh.jpg|180px|thumb|Plaque of Vincent Picek,&lt;br&gt;at the Jan Hus Presbyterian Church]]
'''Jan Hus Presbyterian Church''', located at 351 [[East 74th Street]], [[New York City]], [[New York (state)|New York]], in [[Manhattan]]'s [[Upper East Side]], is a congregation associated with the [[Presbyterian Church USA]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nycpresbytery.org/congregations/congregational-directory/manhattan/ |title=Congregations in Manhattan: Presbytery of New York City |publisher=Nycpresbytery.org |date=May 4, 2010 |accessdate=July 24, 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111003154815/http://www.nycpresbytery.org/congregations/congregational-directory/manhattan/# |archive-date=2011-10-03 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The church is named for [[Jan Hus]], a [[Bohemian]] priest who was a theologian and reformer.&lt;ref name="nycago1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nycago.org/Organs/NYC/html/JanHusPres.html |title=Jan Hus Presbyterian Church – New York City |publisher=Nycago.org |date= |accessdate=July 24, 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110727134616/http://www.nycago.org/Organs/NYC/html/JanHusPres.html |archivedate=July 27, 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The church is in the area that was once known as [[West Village|Little Bohemia]]. Once a center of the Czech community, the church now has a diversified inclusionist congregation.

The church runs an active Neighborhood House that promotes music, theater and culture and operates a homeless outreach program. The church basement includes a 150-seat theatre that was home to [[Gilbert and Sullivan]] performing groups almost continuously from 1952 to 1975. [[Chicago City Limits]] performed there throughout the 1980s. Since then, several arts organizations have been based at the theatre.

==History==
The church was founded in 1877 when Gustav Alexy, a [[Hungarian people|Hungarian]] missionary, wanted to work among the [[Czechs|Czech]] community.&lt;ref name="janhus1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.janhus.org/history.htm |title=A Short History of Jan Hus Presbyterian Church and Neighborhood House |publisher=Janhus.org |date= |accessdate=July 24, 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111003171423/http://www.janhus.org/history.htm |archivedate=October 3, 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.radio.cz/en/section/special/the-jan-hus-church-in-new-york-a-remnant-of-the-upper-east-sides-czech-past |title=The Jan Hus Church in New York – a remnant of the Upper East Side’s Czech past – Radio Prague |publisher=Radio.cz |date= |author= |accessdate=July 24, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The building was designed by [[R.H. Robertson]] and built in 1888, and bears the inscription ''"Truth Prevails"'', a famous Jan Hus saying. The church sits down the block from the Byzantine Moderne-style Greek Orthodox [[Archdiocesan Cathedral of the Holy Trinity]].&lt;ref name="google2"&gt;{{cite book|title=AIA Guide to New York City|author1=White, N.|author2=Willensky, E.|author3=Leadon, F.|date=2010|publisher=Oxford University Press, USA|isbn=9780199772919|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=t0gj61QSgk8C|page=968|accessdate=May 14, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When Pastor Alexy died in 1880, the newly official [[Presbyterian Church]] asked 21-year-old Vincent Pisek to take over as leader. At the turn of the century Czech families immigrated to America in large numbers settling in New York. The followers of Jan Hus had been persecuted or forced out of [[Bohemia]]. Pisek was "free-thinking" and performed marriages between men and women from different ethnic groups. His enthusiasm to help make these marriages was a part of what helped to build his church.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author= |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1931/03/30/archives/memorial-tablet-to-dr-pisek-50-years-pastor-is-unveiled-at-jan-hus.html |title=Memorial Tablet to Dr. Pisek, 50 Years Pastor, Is Unveiled at Jan Hus Presbyterian Church |publisher=nytimes.com |date=July 3, 2011 |accessdate=July 24, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

With thousands of Czech parishioners when the church started,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Crossette |first=Barbara |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1976/09/10/archives/in-search-of-the-czechoslovak-east-side.html |title=In Search of the Czechoslovak East Side |publisher=nytimes.com |date=September 10, 1976 |author= |accessdate=July 24, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author= |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1952/02/16/archives/czech-worshipers-to-mark-75-years-three-generations-will-honor.html |title=CZECH WORSHIPERS TO MARK 75 YEARS – Three Generations Will Honor Presbyterian Church Named for Jan Hus, the Martyr |publisher=nytimes.com |date=July 3, 2011 |accessdate=July 24, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; the congregation has changed greatly with the Czech community dispersing over the years. By the 1950s, Jan Hus Church was no longer predominantly Czech.&lt;ref name="janhus2"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.janhus.org/about_us.htm |title=About Us |publisher=Janhus.org |date= |accessdate=July 24, 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111003171447/http://www.janhus.org/about_us.htm |archivedate=October 3, 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Jan Hus Church has not had a Czech pastor since the 1960s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9C04E4DF1130F934A35757C0A9609C8B63&amp;pagewanted=all |title=. |publisher= |date= April 7, 2006|author= |accessdate=July 24, 2011 |work=The New York Times |first=Joseph |last=Berger}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Jan Hus was among the first churches to become an [[Open and Affirming]] congregation for the full inclusion of Gay, Lesbian, Bisexual, and Transgender people in church life&lt;ref name="janhus2"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.newsday.com/news/nation/presbyterians-continue-to-be-divided-over-gays-1.2089620 |title=Presbyterians continue to be divided over gays |publisher=Newsday |date= |author= |accessdate=July 24, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.amendment10a.org/2010/11/219th-ga-overture-advocate-rev-ray.html |title=219th GA Overture Advocate Rev.

==Jan Hus Neighborhood House==
Through the efforts Vincenc Pisek of [[Malesov]], the successor of Gustav Alexy of [[Rožnov pod Radhoštěm|Roznov]], the new modern Czech Brethren Presbyterian House was built in 1888.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Miloslav Rechcigl, Jr. |url=http://www.jewishgen.org/austriaczech/gateway.html |title=Gateway to America |publisher=Jewishgen.org |date= |accessdate=July 24, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Among its many community efforts Jan Hus Church organizes a homeless outreach program called HOAP.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.northwesthumanservices.org/NWHS_HOAP.php |title=NWHS Homeless Outreach &amp; Advocacy Project |publisher=Northwesthumanservices.org |date= |accessdate=July 24, 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110529020241/http://www.northwesthumanservices.org/NWHS_HOAP.php |archivedate=May 29, 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The program HOAP assists more than fifty guests with immediate responses to their physical needs. The program also allows the homeless to use the church's address for their mailing address, and currently receives mail for over 500 people.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nycservice.org/organizations/1017 |title=Jan Hus Church Homeless Outreach Program |publisher=NYC Service |date= |accessdate=July 24, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1888, the J.H. &amp; C.S. Odell Company installed a "Size No. 9" organ in the church, The Odell Size 9 organ had a case of "appropriate and approved design, made of Walnut, Chestnut, or Ash," with "the large speaking pipes displayed in front to be gilded, silvered, or richly ornamented in gold and colors." The organ measured {{convert|16|ft|m}} high, 11 feet, 3 inches wide, and 7 feet, 3 inches deep. This organ was removed in 1969 by Alan Laufman and Guy Henderson, but the organ case and display pipes were left in the church.&lt;ref name="nycago1"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Dunlap, David W. From Abyssinian to Zion: A Guide to Manhattan's Houses of Worship. New York: Columbia University Press, 2004.&lt;/ref&gt;

Like many churches in New York City, Jan Hus rents out its space for community and artistic events; however, Jan Hus has been dedicated to this mission for its community for decades.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9E0CEEDE113CF934A15751C1A964958260&amp;pagewanted=all |title=Houses of Worship Widening Rentals |publisher=New York Times |date=December 27, 1992 |accessdate=July 24, 2011 |first=Claudia H. |last=Deutsch}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1914, Atherton Pisek and the Jan Hus community raised funds to open the Neighborhood House and in 1915, the church built its [[Neighborhood House]] to celebrate Czech culture: the folk music, the dance, [[marionette]] theatre, and music. Located on the easternmost portion of our building, the Neighborhood House was to be a cultural and social center for the [[Bohemian]] people, a place for art and music, job training, a dental clinic, clubs, athletics, language classes and more. While expanded beyond the Czech community, the Neighborhood House continues to promote music, theater, and culture.&lt;ref name="janhus1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="ourtownny1"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://newyork.timeout.com/music-nightlife/classical-opera/119633/jan-hus-playhouse |title=Jan Hus Playhouse – Manhattan – Classical &amp; Opera |publisher=Time Out New York |date= |accessdate=July 24, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Jan Hus Playhouse Theater==
The Jan Hus theater has presented and housed several art events and organizations.
*From 1952 to 1967, the 150-seat theater served as the home of the [[American Savoyards]].
*In May 1960, The Actors' Co-op performed a revival of the ''[[Insect Comedy]]'', with [[Barbra Streisand]] in her first New York role.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.barbratimeless.com/Barbras%20New%20York%20Jan%20Hus.htm |title=Jan Hus Playhouse |publisher=Barbratimeless.com |date= |accessdate=July 24, 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110905004942/http://www.barbratimeless.com/Barbras%20New%20York%20Jan%20Hus.htm# |archive-date=2011-09-05 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://barbra-archives.com/live/60s/insect_comedy.html |title=Barbra Streisand Archives &amp;#124; Insect Comedy (1960) |publisher=Barbra-archives.com |date= |accessdate=July 24, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*From 1969 to 1975, the theater became the home of LOOM ([[Light Opera of Manhattan#Beginning years at the Jan Hus|Light Opera of Manhattan]]), which was an [[Off-Broadway]] repertory theater company performing 52 weeks per year.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5695">'''Jean-Marie Brohm''' is a [[France|French]] [[sociologist]], [[anthropologist]] and [[philosopher]]. Professor of sociology at the University of [[Montpellier]] III, he was also the founder of the journal ''Quel Corps ?'',&lt;ref&gt;see the anthology ''L'opium Sportif: La Critique Radicale Du Sport. De L'extreme Gauche a Quel Corps'', ed. by Jean-Pierre Escriva and Henri Vaugrand, Paris, L’Harmattan, 1996&lt;/ref&gt; member of the editorial staff of the monthly ''Répertoire'' and is actually director of the journal ''Prétentaine''. Brohm has written many books and is the leading proponent of the radical critique of sport in France.

According to Brohm the "[....] critical theory of sport is founded on three principal axes:

1)	Sport is not simply sport but a means of government, a means of pressure on public opinion and a mode of [[ideological framing]] of the populations and of parts of the youth, and this in all countries of the world, in totalitarian countries as well as in so called democratic countries. This was noticeable during the big political events which were the Olympic Games in Moscow, the soccer championship in Argentina and, more recently, in France.

2) Sport has become a sector of accumulation of wealth, money, and therefore also of capital. It attracts considerable amounts of money; I would even say today it is the most spectacular showcase of the globalized society of commodities. Sport has become a key commodity of this society.

3) The last point, the ideological aspect properly speaking. Sport constitutes a political body, a space of ideological investment in gestures and movements. You can see this for example with Combat sports. It’s also an ideological valorisation of efforts via asceticism, training, self-sacrifice; sport is presented as an ideological model. Sport institutes a bodily order founded on the management of sexual drives and aggressive impulses; insofar as it seems that sport is a form of social appeasement, social integration, reducing violence, allowing fraternity; this type of discourse to me is a load of muddled illusions and mystifications. We have therefore scrutinized sport starting from these three viewpoints: political, economical, and ideological." &lt;ref&gt;[http://1libertaire.free.fr/Brohm08.html Compétition : La vraie toxicomanie] retrieved may 15, 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

==The beginnings of the radical critique of sport==
Despite two older articles of Brohm&lt;ref&gt;«Forger des âmes en forgeant des corps» (partisans nr 15, may 1966) and «Sociologie politique du sport»(partisans , nr 28, june 1967)&lt;/ref&gt; the radical critique of sport really began in 1968 with number 43 («Sport, culture et répression» [Sport, culture and repression]) of the leftist magazine ''partisans''.

"[…] the texts which were published in this issue […] had the effect of a bomb on the world of sport and physical education. Sport and physical education, which up to this time were  considered only in positive terms, were brutally attacked in their very foundations and their social function. In reply, the resistance in both fields was equally violent." &lt;ref&gt;Jacques Gleyse, ''Archéologie de l'éducation physique au XXème siècle en France : le corps occulté'', Paris 2006, p. 225&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Józef Jarzębowski''', b. 26 November 1897 in [[Warsaw]] - d. 13 September 1964 in [[Herisau]], [[Switzerland]], was a Polish-born Roman Catholic priest, member of the [[Marian Fathers]]. He was an [[educationalist]], historian, writer and noted [[antiquarian]].

==Life==
Raised by his widowed mother as one of three children, Jarzębowski came from an impoverished background. He was a good scholar, but suffered from poor health.
In 1917 he joined the Polish province of the Marian Fathers. After abbreviated theological and history studies at the [[Catholic University of Lublin]], from 1925 to 1937 he was a history and humanities teacher at the [[Bielany]] college of his order in Warsaw.&lt;ref&gt;Biographical interview with [[Maciej Matthew Szymanski]] in 1996 where 1 minute into the film there is a Bielany school photograph of Szymanski, his classmates and Józef Jarzębowski, their teacher. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qcgx6uPACLU&lt;/ref&gt; In 1938 he published a life of his revolutionary hero, [[Romuald Traugutt]].&lt;ref&gt;Jarzębowski, Józef. ''[[Romuald Traugutt|Traugutt]]''. Nakładem Archidiecezjalnego Instytutu Akcji Katolickiej, Warszawa, 1938.&lt;/ref&gt; At the outbreak of [[World War II]], he managed to evade the [[Nazi occupation of Poland|Nazi occupiers]] and made his way eastwards to [[Vilnius]]. There he met professor of theology, [[Michael Sopocko|Michał Sopoćko]] who had been the [[Spiritual direction|spiritual director]] of a recently deceased young nun, [[Faustina Kowalska|Faustyna Kowalska]] (1905–1938). From him he learned about her revelations and her devotion to the ''[[Divine Mercy]] of Jesus''. This devotion was symbolised in a painting that was commissioned by Sopoćko from his colleague at [[Stefan Batory University]], the professor of Art, [[Eugeniusz Kazimirowski]]. Its execution was guided by Kowalska herself. Jarzębowski resolved then to become an ''"apostle of Divine Mercy"''. In 1941 he succeeded in evading the Soviet authorities and made his way into exile through [[Russia]] and [[Japan]] to the United States where he worked as a chaplain to various Polish communities.&lt;ref&gt;Synowiec-Tobis, Stella, H. ''The Fulfillment of Visionary Dream: The Destruction of the Polish Nation''. Xlibris Corporation, 2011, p.290-308. {{ISBN|978 1456812300}}&lt;/ref&gt; He also travelled to Mexico where he looked after displaced children and spread the message of ''Divine Mercy''.&lt;ref&gt;Bowles, Darrell. ''Out of the Valley of Tears: One Man's Journey to Truth''. Hillcrest Publishing Group. 2010 p.112 ff. {{ISBN|978 1936400041}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Kazimirowski Eugeniusz, Divine Mercy, 1934.jpg|thumb|right|100px|[[Eugeniusz Kazimirowski|Kazimirowski]]'s, ''Divine Mercy'', 1934]]

In the late 1940s Jarzębowski was summoned by his order to the United Kingdom to work with the thousands of Poles displaced there after the war and living in resettlement camps. Initially in 1950 he was a pastor and teacher at a Marian boys' school in [[Hereford]]. This was followed in 1953 by the acquisition of substantial former [[British Army]] quarters at [[Fawley Court]], outside [[Henley-on-Thames]] where, with the financial assistance of the Polish community in the United Kingdom, he founded ''[[Divine Mercy College]]'', a Catholic boarding school for Polish and local boys.&lt;ref&gt;Synowiec-Tobis, Stella, H. ''The Fulfillment of Visionary Dream: The Destruction of the Polish Nation''. Xlibris Corporation, 2011, p.319.&lt;/ref&gt; The school lasted till 1986 after rolls had fallen substantially. Alongside the school Jarzębowski used the [[Grade I listed]] 17th-century manor house, as the home of his extensive antiquarian library and museum where valuable ''polonica'' had been assembled as well as items of wider European historical interest, to which other deposits and loans were added by Polish collectors.&lt;ref&gt;{{NHLE|num=1125740| desc=  Name: FAWLEY COURT (DIVINE MERCY COLLEGE) |accessdate = 7 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Jarzębowski died in 1964 while on a religious retreat in Switzerland.&lt;ref&gt;Short biography of Fr. Jarzębowski in Polish on the [[Marian Fathers]]' website: https://www.padrimariani.org/pl/heritage/great_figures/jarzebowski.php .&lt;/ref&gt; His remains were brought back to Fawley Court for burial. They were exhumed in 2012 as a condition of the subsequent controversial sale by the Polish order of the Thames-side property. Józef Jarzębowski died with the opinion of sanctity and a request for his [[Beatification]] was deposited in 1993 with the [[Auxiliary bishop]] of Warsaw, [[Monsignor|Msgr]]. {{Interlanguage link|Zbigniew Józef Kraszewski|pl}}. Jarzębowski's current resting place is in the Fairmile cemetery, Henley.&lt;ref&gt;BBC News, Oxford 24 April 2012: "Polish priest Jozef Jarzebowski's body to be moved", https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-dorset-17827097&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Fawley Court website in Polish reporting about exhumation and reburial at Fairmile Cemetery: http://www.fawleycourt.info&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legacy==
===Teacher and writer===
There were four distinct periods of teaching in Jarzębowski's life, the first and longest being that as a schoolmaster in Warsaw, 1925–1937. Shortly before the Second World War, he was given leave by his order to pursue full-time his researches into the leading figures of the Polish [[January Uprising]]. This produced a book on Traugutt and material for later publications. After his escape from war-torn Poland, he once again took up teaching in the 1940s at Santa Rosa in Mexico where he was assigned to a school for displaced and orphaned Polish children. The third phase was 1950–1952 when he taught boys from [[Polish Resettlement Corps|Polish resettlement]] camps outside Hereford in England. As the Polish population dispersed and became more integrated with its host country, while Poland was more firmly in the Soviet sphere of influence, the view among the [[Polish diaspora]] was that Polish culture should be maintained among its youth whether or not there might be an eventual return to their home country. With this in mind, it was resolved to establish a boys' secondary school - a girls boarding school had already been set up in [[Northamptonshire]] - to foster Polish traditions alongside a British curriculum. Jarzębowski found the recently abandoned and vacant dilapidated historic country house outside Henley that would combine his teacher's calling with his dream of a suitable setting for his historical and antiquarian interests. It was the fourth and final phase of his educational and writing career. It was also the place where he wished to be laid to rest. He achieved all those aims at least for the duration of his own life time.&lt;ref&gt;Kraszewski, Zbigniew. ''Miłosierdzie Boże ratunkiem dla świata: ks. Józef Jarzębowski Marianin Apostoł Miłosierdzia Bożego''. Warszawa, 1984&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Fawley Court-1342938830.jpg|thumb|left|300px|[[Fawley Court]], glimpsed from the banks of the [[Thames]]]]

===Divine Mercy College===
In 1953 Jarzębowski became spiritual leader of the Marian community and headmaster of the educational foundation that was [[Divine Mercy College]]. It became a religious and cultural centre for Poles in the South of England and beyond, hosting large numbers of visitors on feast days, especially at [[Pentecost]]. Although the priests formed the backbone of the College staff, they were complemented by secular women and men teachers, supported by a parents' association, the broader Friends of Fawley Court and frequent visitations from high-ranking prelates. Among the alumni of the school is the writer, broadcaster and art critic, [[Waldemar Januszczak]].

Although Jarzębowski gradually withdrew from active participation in the college, due to health problems and to concentrate on his spiritual and historical interests, the momentum he had given to the setting continued for a further 20 years after his premature death in 1964. His successor was Fr. Andrzej Janicki, a veteran of the [[Warsaw Uprising]], historian and [[Sci-Fi]] writer.&lt;ref&gt;Obituary of Father Andrzej Janicki, 2009: http://www.padrimariani.org/en/resources/news/3956.html&lt;/ref&gt; After the school closed in 1986, Fawley Court became a conference and retreat centre.

As the post-war generation of Poles disappeared, community support for the asset went into decline. The new generation of priests from the Polish province who arrived to replace the old guard were raised in communist Poland and appeared to be at sea coping with an English [[stately home]] and its management. They were seemingly unable to capitalise on the huge influx of Polish migrants to the UK after Poland's accession to the [[European Union|EU]]. Whereas the [[2001 UK Census]] recorded 60,711 Polish-born UK residents;&lt;ref name=OECD&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.oecd.org/dataoecd/18/23/34792376.xls |title=Country-of-birth database |publisher=[[Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development]] |accessdate=4 October 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090617032129/http://www.oecd.org/dataoecd/18/23/34792376.xls |archivedate=17 June 2009 |df=dmy}}&lt;/ref&gt; 60,680 of these resided in Great Britain (not including [[Northern Ireland]]) - compared with 73,951 in 1991 - &lt;ref name="Born abroad"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/shared/spl/hi/uk/05/born_abroad/countries/html/poland.stm |title=Born abroad: Poland |publisher=BBC News |accessdate=4 October 2009 | date=7 September 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; following immigration after Poland's accession to the EU, the [[Office for National Statistics]] estimated 911,000 Polish-born residents in the UK in 2016, making Poles the largest overseas-born group.&lt;ref name="Office for National Statistics 2016"/&gt;

The Marian order's energies and finances were anyway being strained by a massive new sanctuary project in Poland and Jarzębowski's dream for Fawley Court fell victim to other congregational priorities. The invaluable asset was put up for sale in 2009 among lasting controversy and campaigns to save it for the community.&lt;ref&gt;''The Save Fawley Court Heritage Committee'': Letter to the Superior General of the [[Marian Fathers]]. http://www.fawleycourt.info/index.php?tyt=7&amp;l=1 Retrieved 19 June 2018.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Website dedicated to Fawley Court: http://www.fawleycourt.info/index.php?tyt=136&amp;l=1 Retrieved 15 June 2018.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Fawley Court Library and Museum===
Jarzębowski was also an assiduous collector, since before the war, of Polish [[Militaria]] and historical materials related to the [[November Uprising|November]] and [[January Uprising]]s. Fawley Court housed a Museum of national significance and was the subject of a detailed study published by the [[National Library of Poland]].&lt;ref&gt;''Fawley Court : Pałac i Muzeum : Historic House and Museum'', Authors: Danuta Szewczyk-Prokurat; Maria Wrede; Philip Earl Steele, Warszawa: published by Biblioteka Narodowa, 2003, in Polish and English.&lt;/ref&gt; The collection comprised a number of sculptures, most notably an [[Nerva-Antonine dynasty|Antonine]] period marble bust said to be of the juvenile [[Commodus]], that Fr. Jarzębowski had brought back from [[Mexico]] in 1944. It had been on loan to the [[Ashmolean Museum]] (1973–1985) but after a failed attempt to sell it in 1985, it was finally sold at a [[Christie's]] auction in 2005.&lt;ref&gt;German Archeological Institute Database of Graeco-Roman objects, https://arachne.dainst.org/entity/1097768&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="christies"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.christies.com/lotfinder/lot/a-roman-marble-portrait-bust-of-an-4585444-details.aspx?from=salesummery&amp;intObjectID=4585444&amp;sid=264aeff4-86bf-48ef-9a59-744cc9f6a4a0|title=A ROMAN MARBLE PORTRAIT BUST OF AN ANTONINE PRINCE, CIRCA 160-170 A.D.|website=Christie's|accessdate=13 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Also sold in 1985 was an earlier acquisition, by a previous owner of Fawley Court, John Freeman, of a fragment from the [[Pergamon Altar]] that Freeman had placed over the entrance to the Gothic folly in the [[Capability Brown]] designed grounds. The Jarzębowski collection also contained: an armoury of the 16th–19th centuries of European, Asian and Far Eastern provenance, other militaria ranging from the last Polish uprising to World War II, French, Portuguese and Polish tapestries of the 16th-18th centuries, Italian Baroque paintings, drawings, including by [[Annibale Carracci]], sacred art including icons, coins, medals and a notable philatelic collection.
&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=www.basco.net.pl |url=http://www.fawleycourt.info/index.php?tyt=73&amp;l=1 |title=Muzeum - English version soon available e-mail: savefawley@hotmail |publisher=Fawleycourt.info |date= |accessdate=26 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The library consisted of around 15,000 volumes from the 19th and 20th centuries, relating to history, theology and travel. There were also 450 prints of the 16th–18th centuries of Western European and Polish origin, with 7 [[Incunable]]s pressed in the 15th century. Among the first editions were early piano compositions by [[Maria Szymanowska]]. Among the 250 or so manuscripts, were the autographs of poets and writers from 1815 to 1983, documents issued by Polish kings (up to the 18th-c.) and [[Papal bull]]s and letters by national heroes. There was also a significant cartographic collection.&lt;ref name=nimoz&gt;{{pl icon}} Łaskarzewska, Hanna and Figiel, Martyna, 'Polskie Dziedzictwo Kulturowe w Krajach Europy Zachodniej: Zbiory Biblioteczne - stan zachowania' in ''Cenne, bezcenne i utracone'' p.25-26 http://nimoz.pl/upload/wydawnictwa/cenne_bezcenne_utracone/2009_2/Strony_21-28_bybloteky.pdf Article about 'Polish cultural heritage abroad with reference to library collections - their state', in the ''Journal of the National Institute of Museums''.&lt;/ref&gt; The Museum and Library had been a member of the ''Standing Conference of Museums, Archives and Libraries in the West''.&lt;ref&gt;http://mabpz.org/ Website of the ''Standing Conference of Polish Museums, Archives and Libraries in the West'' (in Polish).

In 2010 the Marian Fathers opened a "''Józef Jarzębowski Museum''" in his honour, as part of their new pilgrim centre at the [[Basilica of Our Lady of Licheń]] in Central Poland.

'''Malek Chebel''' (1953 – 12 November 2016) was a renowned Algerian [[philosopher]] and [[anthropologist]] of [[religion]]s . He was one of the most prominent North African intellectuals. He studied in Algeria, then later in France at [[Paris]] where he also studied [[psychoanalysis]]. He was a teacher at many universities worldwide.

Essayist, author of books specialized in [[Arab world]] and [[Islam]], he created the expression: “Islam of lights”. He spoke at numerous conferences in Europe and Africa.

He is known for his reflections about Islam, its culture, its history, intellectual life. He is also famous for his public positions for a liberal Islam, and for its reform. His famous works include 'The Manifesto for an Enlightened Islam'.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://memri.org/reports/following-death-algerian-intellectual-malek-chebel-memri-reposts-report-his-27-propositions|title=Following Death Of Algerian Intellectual Malek Chebel, MEMRI Reposts Report On His 27 Propositions For Reforming Islam|last=Szerman|first=N.|date=13 November 2016|publisher=Middle East Media Research Institute|accessdate=25 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Biography ==
Born in 1953 at Philippeville, now [[Skikda]] in Algeria, Chebel pursued his primary and secondary studies there and obtained his [[Baccalauréat|baccalaureate]] in philosophy and Arab letters. He entered the university of Ain El Bay ([[Constantine, Algeria|Constantine]]) in 1977, then he went to France to pursue his university studies. In 1980, he obtained a first degree in clinical psychopathology and psychoanalysis from [[Paris 7 - Denis Diderot University|Paris 7 University.]]

Then, in 1982, Chebel obtained his [[doctorate]] of [[anthropology]], [[ethnology]] and [[science of religions]] at [[Jussieu University|Jussieu]], and in 1984, he earned a doctorate in [[political science]] at the [[Institute of political studies paris|institute of political studies]] at Paris. He worked at the research direction at the [[Sorbonne]]. He worked and gave conferences in Europe, in the Arab world and in America.

== His thoughts ==
The prolific work of Malek Chebel with his vast experience as a historian, psychoanalyst and anthropologist is mainly devoted to the defense of freedom in all its forms: political freedom, freedom of thought, freedom to live and love and its place in Islam and Muslim culture. Freedom guides his reflection about the body, desire, love, relations between men and women, but also about tolerance, politic engagement, and generosity. He called for the end of violence (in all its forms).

He prefaced several books including the translation of [[Quran]] made by Edouard Montet. He died of cancer on 12 November 2016.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.lemonde.fr/disparitions/article/2016/11/12/deces-de-l-anthropologue-malek-chebel-defenseur-d-un-islam-des-lumieres_5030163_3382.html|title=Décès de l’anthropologue Malek Chebel, défenseur d’un «islam des Lumières»|date=12 November 2016|publisher=[[Le Monde]]|language=French|accessdate=12 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Islam and Occident ==
His work "Islam and free will" aims to understand Islam and its relation with the Occident. Understanding the ways of thinking, of living, the sensibilities of the other to go beyond hatred, giving him a place in this world. It is also an interrogation about the place of freedom in Islam, and an invitation for new research on Islam and its traditions.
He called for a return to the original tenets of Islam to combat fundamental Islamism.
“The majority of Muslims are caught between two groups: on the one hand a small group of violent Muslims who want to Islamize the world; and on the other hand the majority of the Western people who don’t understand Islam”.

He reminds us that Islam is plural and alive. He also reminds us that in the past, Islam has been innovative in a lot of aspects of life. He analyzed the evolution and mutations of mentalities in the Muslim world. Chebel affirmed that through the centuries, there were a great periods of peace, creativity and happiness along with periods of brutal violence. He states, “It in the name of these centuries that I work; in the name of many [[scientist]]s, writers, grammarians, jurists, doctors that I speak."

'''Margaret of Ypres''' (1216–1237) was a [[Flemish]] [[visionary]], [[Asceticism|ascetic]], [[Dominican Order|Dominican]] [[penitent]] and [[flagellant]].
She was one of a number of [[13th century]] [[Laity|lay]] women who led devout lives, following the example of [[Marie of Oignies]]. Called ''mulieres religiosae'' or ''mulieres sanctae'', some gathered together in [[beguinage]]s while many others lived at home practicing [[voluntary poverty]], [[chastity]], [[prayer]], [[fasting]] and [[penance]], a lifestyle known as the ''vita apostolica'' in imitation of [[Christ]].&lt;ref&gt;Anke Passenier, ''Women on the Loose, Stereotypes of Women in the Story of the Medieval Beguines'', included in ''Female Stereotypes in Religious Traditions'', Ria Kloppenborg &amp; Wouter J Hanegraaff, eds, Leiden: Brill Academic Publishers, 1995, pp 68-69&lt;/ref&gt; In Margaret’s time, such Dominican female penitents were unregulated by the Church and were under the guidance of individual spiritual advisers. A rule would not be established until [[Munio of Zamora]]’s ''Rule of the Brothers and Sisters of Penance of the Blessed Dominic (Regula Fratrum et Sororum Ordinis de Paenitentiae Beati Dominici)'' in the late 13th century.&lt;ref&gt;Maiju Lehmijoki-Gardner, ed. &amp; trans., Dominican Penitent Women, Mahwah NJ: Paulist Press, 2005, pp 3-6&lt;/ref&gt;

==Life==
Information on Margaret comes from a biography, ''The Life of Margaret Ypres'' by Thomas de Cantimpré, written in 1240.&lt;ref&gt;Thomas de Cantimpré, ''The Life of Margaret Ypres'', Margot H. King, trans., Toronto: Peregrina Publishing Co., 1990.&lt;/ref&gt; Margaret was born in [[Ypres]] into a well-off middle class family. Her father died when she was four and Margaret, with her mother and three sisters, went to live with an uncle. She showed a predilection for a holy life from a young age. While attending a local [[convent school]], she smelled a wonderful odor on first beholding the [[Sacramental bread|host]] and begged the [[Abbess]] to be allowed to partake of the [[Eucharist]] with the [[nun]]s. From the age of seven she began severe [[fasting]] and practiced [[self-mortification]] by stuffing stinging nettles and burrs down the front of her dress. By age ten she was tearing her flesh with thorns to experience the torment of Christ.

After the death of her uncle when she was 18, she turned to the Dominican Friar Zegher from [[Lille]] as her spiritual director, who encouraged her in her devotions. About this time she was attracted to a young man, but quelled her feelings and made a vow of chastity. She retreated entirely from the world and spent her days in constant prayer, even, although she rarely spoke, praying when in conversation with her mother and sisters. To avoid the temptation of men, she had her mother dismiss a twelve year old boy who was helping in the household.

Margaret slept little, often due to severe headaches, ate little, kept frequent vigils, engaged in long periods of fasting and continued her self-mortification. She wore ragged clothing and would go out [[begging]] until Zegher made her stop. Any money she received from begging she gave to the [[Leprosy|lepers]]. Margaret had visions of Christ and of the [[Virgin Mary]] and felt [[angel]]s holding her up when her austerities left her too weak to stand.
Many miracles were attributed to Margaret, such as making whole some smashed eggs so the family would have something to eat, and saving her sister who was on the point of death during childbirth.

Her austere lifestyle took a toll on her health and she was eventually bedridden, experiencing great pain, fevers and convulsions, all of which tribulations she bore with grace. After lingering for a year, she died at age of 21.

'''Moral rationalism''', also called '''ethical rationalism''', is a view in [[meta-ethics]] (specifically the [[epistemology]] of [[ethics]]) according to which moral principles are knowable ''[[A priori and a posteriori|a priori]]'', by reason alone.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/919107782|title=Ethical rationalism and the law|others=Capps, Patrick,, Pattinson, Shaun D.,|isbn=9781849467865|location=Oxford|oclc=919107782}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some prominent figures in the [[history of philosophy]] who have defended moral rationalism are [[Plato]] and [[Immanuel Kant]]. Perhaps the most prominent figure in the history of philosophy who has rejected moral rationalism is [[David Hume]]. Recent philosophers who have defended moral rationalism include [[R. M. Hare|Richard Hare]], [[Christine Korsgaard]], [[Alan Gewirth]], and [[Michael A. Smith (philosopher)|Michael Smith]].

Moral rationalism is similar to the rationalist version of [[ethical intuitionism]]; however, they are distinct views. Moral rationalism is neutral on whether basic moral beliefs are known via inference or not. A moral rationalist who believes that some moral beliefs are justified non-inferentially is a [[Ethical intuitionism#Rational intuition versus moral sense|rationalist ethical intuitionist]]. So, rationalist ethical intuitionism implies moral rationalism, but the reverse does not hold.

==Emotions and reason==

There are two main forms of moral rationalism, associated with two major forms of reasoning.  If moral reasoning is based on [[theoretical reason]], and is hence analogous to discovering [[empirical]] or [[scientific]] [[truth]]s about the world, a purely emotionless being could arrive at the truths of reason.  Such a being wouldn't necessarily be motivated to act morally.  Beings who are motivated to act morally can also arrive at moral truths, but needn't rely upon their emotions to do so.

Many moral rationalists believe that moral reasoning is based on [[practical reason]], which involves choices about what to do or intend to do, including how to achieve one's goals and what goals one should have in the first place.  In this view, moral reasoning always involves emotional states and hence be intrinsically motivating.  Immanuel Kant expressed this view when he said that immoral actions do not involve a contradiction in belief, but a contradiction in the will, that is, in one's commitment to a principle which one intends to motivate actions. Christine Korsgaard's elaboration of Kantian reasoning tries to show that if ethics is actually based on practical reasoning, this shows that it can be objective and universal, without having to appeal to questionable metaphysical assumptions.

==Criticisms==
[[Moral sense theory|Moral sense theorists]] (or sentimentalists), such as [[David Hume]], are the key opponents of moral rationalism. In Book 3 of ''[[A Treatise of Human Nature]]'' and in ''[[An Enquiry Concerning the Principles of Morals]]'' (EPM), Hume argues (among other things) that reason and emotions (or the "passions" as he often calls them) are quite distinct faculties and that the foundations of morality lie in sentiment, not reason. Hume takes it as a fact about human psychology and morality that moral judgments have an essentially emotional, sentimental, or otherwise non-rational or cognitive character to them. According to Hume, "...morality is determined by sentiment. It defines virtue to be whatever mental action or quality gives to a spectator the pleasing sentiment of approbation; and vice the contrary" (EPM, Appendix 1, ¶10).

      <comment>/* Soviet policy */</comment>
      <model>wikitext</model>
      <format>text/x-wiki</format>
      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10850">'''Peaceful coexistence''' ({{lang-ru|Мирное сосуществование|translit=Mirnoye sosushchestvovaniye}}) was a theory developed and applied by the [[Soviet Union]] at various points during the [[Cold War]] in the context of primarily [[Marxist–Leninist]] foreign policy and was adopted by [[Soviet Union|Soviet]]-allied [[socialist state]]s that they could peacefully coexist with the [[capitalism|capitalist]] bloc (i.e., U.S.-allied states). This was in contrast to the [[antagonistic contradiction]] principle that [[socialism]] and [[capitalism]] could never coexist in peace. The [[Soviet Union]] applied it to relations between the western world, particularly between the [[United States]] and [[NATO]] countries and the nations of the [[Warsaw Pact]].

Debates over differing interpretations of peaceful coexistence were one aspect of the [[Sino-Soviet split]] in the 1950s and 1960s. During the 1960s and early 1970s, the [[People's Republic of China]] under the leadership of its founder, [[Mao Zedong]], argued that a belligerent attitude should be maintained towards capitalist countries, and so initially rejected the peaceful coexistence theory as essentially [[Marxist revisionism]].

However, their decision in 1972 to establish a trade relationship with the United States also saw China cautiously adopting a version of the theory to relations between itself and non-socialist countries. From that point through to the early 1980s and [[Socialism with Chinese characteristics]], China increasingly extended its own peaceful coexistence concept to include all nations. [[Enver Hoxha]] also denounced this and turned against China as a result of China growing closer ties to the West such as [[1972 Nixon visit to China]] and today [[Hoxhaist]] parties continue to denounce the concept of peaceful coexistence.

Peaceful coexistence, in extending itself to all countries and social movements tied to the [[USSR]]'s interpretation of communism, quickly became [[modus operandi]] for many individual [[communist parties]] as well, encouraging quite a few, especially those in the [[developed world]], to give up their long-term goal of amassing support for an armed, insurrectionist [[communist revolution]] and exchange it for more full participation in [[elections|electoral politics]].

==Soviet policy==

[[Nikita Khrushchev|Khrushchev]] solidified the concept in Soviet foreign policy in 1956 at the 20th Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union.  The policy arose as a temptation to reduce hostility between the two superpowers, particularly in light of the possibility of [[Nuclear warfare|nuclear war]]. The Soviet theory of peaceful coexistence asserted that the [[United States]] and [[Soviet Union|USSR]], and their respective political ideologies, could coexist rather than fighting one another, and Khrushchev tried to demonstrate his commitment to peaceful coexistence by attending international peace conferences, such as the [[Geneva Summit (1955)|Geneva Summit]], and by traveling internationally, such as his trip to America's [[Camp David]] in 1959. The [[World Peace Council]] founded in 1949 and largely funded by the [[Soviet Union]] attempted to organize a [[peace movement]] in favor of the concept internationally.

Peaceful coexistence was meant to assuage Western, capitalist concerns that the socialist Soviet Union was driven by the concept of [[world revolution]] advocated by its founders, [[Vladimir Lenin]] and the [[Bolshevik]]s. Lenin and the Bolsheviks advocated world revolution through workers' "internal revolutions" within their own nations, but they had never advocated its spread by intra-national warfare, such as invasion by [[Red Army]] troops from a neighboring socialist nation into a capitalist one.

Indeed, short of such "internal revolutions" by workers themselves, Lenin had talked about "peaceful cohabitation" with capitalist countries. Khrushchev used this aspect of Lenin's politics to argue that while socialism would eventually triumph over [[capitalism]], this would be done not by force but by example. Implicitly, this proclamation meant the end of the USSR's advocacy of the spread of communist revolution through insurrectionist violence, which some communists around the world saw as a betrayal of the principles of revolutionary communism itself.

In addition to being a reaction to the realization that a nuclear war between the two superpowers would ensure the destruction of not only the [[socialist]] system but the entirety of humanity, it also reflected the USSR's strategic military disposition - the move away from large, and possibly politically offensive, military ventures towards a force centered on [[proxy war]]s and a strategic nuclear missile force. Although disquiet over this shift helped bring Khrushchev down, his successors did not return to the [[antagonistic contradiction]] theories of an inevitable conflict between the [[capitalist]] and socialist systems. Initially, this was [[People's Republic of China|China]]'s main gripe with the theory, and the reason the latter from then on classified the Soviet Union as a "betrayer of the Revolution."

===Cuban Policy===
{{quote|As Marxists we have maintained that peaceful coexistence among nations does not encompass coexistence between the exploiters and the exploited, between the oppressors and the oppressed.|[[Che Guevara]], December 11, 1964 speech to the [[United Nations]]&lt;ref name="UN"&gt;[http://www.marxists.org/archive/guevara/1964/12/11.htm "Colonialism is Doomed"] speech to the 19th General Assembly of the United Nations in New York City by Cuban representative [[Che Guevara]] on December 11, 1964&lt;/ref&gt;}}

One of the most outspoken critics of peaceful coexistence during the early 1960s was Argentine [[Marxist]] revolutionary [[Che Guevara]]. As a leader in the Cuban government during the [[Cuban Missile Crisis|October Missile Crisis]], Guevara believed that a repeat invasion by the United States (after the [[Bay of Pigs invasion|Bay of Pigs]]) would be justifiable grounds for  a nuclear war. In Guevara's view, the capitalist bloc was composed of "hyenas and jackals" that "fed on unarmed peoples".&lt;ref name="UN" /&gt;

==Chinese policy==

[[Premier]] [[Zhou Enlai]] of the [[People's Republic of China]] proposed the [[Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence]] in 1954 during negotiations with [[India]] over [[Tibet]] and these were written into the ''Agreement Between the People's Republic of China and the Republic of India on Trade and Intercourse Between the Tibet Region of China and India'' signed in 1954 by Zhou and [[Prime Minister of India]] [[Jawaharlal Nehru]]. The principles were reiterated by Zhou at the [[Bandung Conference]] of [[Asia]]n and [[List of sovereign states and dependent territories in Africa|African]] countries where they were incorporated into the conference declarations.  One major consequence of this policy was that the PRC would not support Communist insurgencies in Southeast Asia, particularly in [[Indonesia]] and [[Malaysia]], and would distance itself from [[overseas Chinese]] in those nations.

However, [[Maoist]] doctrine continued to emphasise the survivability of any conflict between the ''imperialist'' and ''socialist'' ''world systems'' - the Chinese continued to advocated a stronger form of the [[campist]] theory of [[global politics]] than that approved in the USSR.

With Mao's death the Chinese softened their line, though would never endorse the views of their rivals. During the late 1970s and 1980s, the concept of peaceful coexistence was expanded as a framework for all sovereign nations.  In 1982 the Five Principles were written into the [[Constitution]] of the People's Republic of China which claims to be bound by them in its international relations.

The Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence as promoted by China are:
*mutual respect for [[sovereignty]] and territorial integrity
*mutual non-aggression
*non-interference in each other's internal affairs
*equality and mutual benefit
*peaceful co-existence

There are three notable consequences of the Chinese concept of peaceful coexistence. First of all, in contrast with the Soviet concepts of the mid-1970s, the Chinese concepts include the encouragement of global [[free trade]]. Second, the Chinese concept of peaceful coexistence places a large emphasis on national sovereignty and territorial integrity, and thus moves by the United States to promote democracy and human rights are seen in this framework as hostile. Finally, as the PRC does not consider [[Taiwan]] to be sovereign, the concept of peaceful coexistence does not extend to Taiwan, and efforts by other nations, particularly the United States, to involve itself in PRC-Taiwan relations are seen as hostile actions in this framework.

==Use in modern diplomacy==

More recently, the phrase has gained currency beyond its usage in communist phraseology and has been adopted by the broader diplomatic world. For instance, in his 2004 Christmas address, [[Pope John Paul II]] called for "peaceful coexistence" in the [[Middle East]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/4124961.stm|title=BBC NEWS - Europe - Pope delivers sombre message|work=bbc.co.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Perpetual peace''' refers to a state of affairs where [[peace]] is permanently established over a certain area.{{fact|date=November 2017}}

The idea of perpetual peace was first suggested in the 18th century, when [[Charles-Irénée Castel de Saint-Pierre]] published his essay "Project for Perpetual Peace" anonymously while working as the negotiator for the [[Treaty of Utrecht]]. However, the idea did not become well known until the late 18th century. The term ''perpetual peace'' became acknowledged when German philosopher [[Immanuel Kant]] published his 1795 essay "[[Perpetual Peace: A Philosophical Sketch]]".&lt;ref&gt;Pietrzyk, Mark E.,Ph.D. "The Idea of a Democratic Zone of Peace: Origins in the Enlightenment" &lt;{{cite web |url=http://www.internationalorder.org/idea.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2013-09-25 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130619045843/http://www.internationalorder.org/idea.html |archivedate=2013-06-19 |df= }}&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt;

Perpetual peace has had significant influence upon modern politics. Perpetual peace has been the foundation for [[peace and conflict studies]], a relatively newly laid field which started in Europe around the 1950s and 1960s.&lt;ref name="test"&gt;[[Peace and conflict studies]]&lt;/ref&gt;

==The Kantian view and its descendants==
The other modern plans for a perpetual peace descend from Kant's 1795 essay, "[[Perpetual Peace: A Philosophical Sketch]]" ("''[[:de:Zum ewigen Frieden|Zum ewigen Frieden. Ein philosophischer Entwurf]]''"). In this essay, Kant described his proposed peace program. Perpetual peace is arguably seen as the starting point of contemporary liberal thought.

"Perpetual Peace" is structured in two parts. The Preliminary Articles described the steps that should be taken immediately, or with all deliberate speed:
#"No secret treaty of peace shall be held valid in which there is tacitly reserved matter for a future war"
#"No independent states, large or small, shall come under the dominion of another state by inheritance, exchange, purchase, or donation"
#"[[Standing army|Standing armies]] shall in time be totally abolished"
#"[[National debts]] shall not be contracted with a view to the external friction of states"
#"No state shall by force interfere with the constitution or government of another state"
#"No state shall, during war, permit such acts of hostility which would make mutual confidence in the subsequent peace impossible: such are the employment of assassins (percussores), poisoners (venefici), breach of capitulation, and incitement to treason (perduellio) in the opposing state"

Three Definitive Articles would provide not merely a cessation of hostilities, but a foundation on which to build a peace:
#"The civil [[constitution]] of every state should be [[Republic|republican]]"
#"The law of nations shall be founded on a federation of free states"
#"The law of [[world citizenship]] shall be limited to conditions of universal [[hospitality]]"

Kant's essay in some ways resembles modern [[democratic peace theory]], though it also differs significantly from it. He speaks of [[Republicanism|republican]] (''Republikanisch'') states (rather than of [[Democracy|democratic]] ones), which he defines to have [[Representation (politics)|representative]] governments, in which the [[legislature]] is [[separation of powers|separated]] from the [[executive (government)|executive]]. He does not discuss [[universal suffrage]], which is vital to modern democracy and quite important to some modern theorists; his commentators dispute whether it is implied by his language. Most importantly, he does not regard [[republic]]an governments as sufficient by themselves to produce peace: freedom of travel, though not necessarily migration, (hospitality); and a league of nations are necessary to consciously enact his six-point program.

Unlike some modern theorists, Kant claims not that republics will be at peace only with each other, but are more pacific than other forms of government in general.

The general idea that popular and [[responsible government]]s would be more inclined to promote peace and commerce became one current in the stream of European thought and political practice. It was one element of the American policy of [[George Canning]] and the foreign policy of [[Henry John Temple, 3rd Viscount Palmerston|Lord Palmerston]]. It was also represented in the [[liberal internationalism]] of [[Woodrow Wilson]], [[George Creel]], and [[H.G. Wells]], although other planks in Kant's platform had even more influence.  In the next generation, Kant's program was represented by the [[Four Freedoms]] and the [[United Nations]].

Kant's essay is a three-legged stool (besides the preliminary disarmament). Various projects for perpetual peace have relied on one leg – either claiming that it is sufficient to produce peace, or that it will create the other two.

In 1909, [[Norman Angell]] relied only upon the second leg, arguing that modern commerce made war necessarily unprofitable, even for the technically victorious country, and therefore the possibility of successful war was ''[[The Great Illusion]]''. [[James Mill]] had described the [[British Empire]] as [[workfare|outdoor relief]] for the upper classes; [[Joseph Schumpeter]] argued that [[capitalism]] made modern [[Sovereign state|states]] inherently peaceful and opposed to conquest and [[imperialism]], which economically favored the old [[Aristocracy|aristocratic]] elites.

This theory has been well developed in recent years.  Mansfield and Pollins, writing in the Journal of Conflict Resolution, summarize a large body of empirical work which, for the most part, supports the thesis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://www.people.fas.harvard.edu/~johnston/GOV90ia/week%203/mansfield.pdf |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080828175701/http://www.people.fas.harvard.edu/~johnston/GOV90ia/week%203/mansfield.pdf |archivedate=August 28, 2008 |title=The Study of Interdependence and Conflict |first1=Edward D |last1=Mansfield |first2=Brian M |last2=Pollins |journal=Journal of Conflict Resolution |volume=45 |number=6 |date=December 2001 |pages=834–859}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are various exceptions and qualifications which seem to limit the circumstances under which economic interdependence results in conflict reduction.  On the other hand, moving beyond economic interdependence to the issue of [[economic freedom]] within states, Erik Gartzke has found [[empirical evidence]] that economic freedom (as measured by the [[Fraser Institute Economic Freedom Index]]) is about fifty times more effective than democracy in reducing violent conflict.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |chapter-url=http://www.cato.org/pubs/efw/efw2005/efw2005-2.pdf |title=Economic Freedom of the World: 2005 Annual Report |chapter=2: Economic Freedom and Peace |first=Erik |last=Gartzke |publisher=The Cato Institute |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081016060114/http://www.cato.org/pubs/efw/efw2005/efw2005-2.pdf |archivedate=2008-10-16 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The third leg is the old idea that a confederation of peaceable princes could produce a perpetual peace. Kant had distinguished his league from a universal state; [[Clarence Streit]] proposed, in ''Union Now'' (1938), a union of the democratic states modelled after the Constitution of the United States. He argued that trade and the peaceable ways of democracy would keep this Union perpetual, and counted on the combined power of the Union to deter the [[Axis Powers|Axis]] from war.

In "[[A Plan for an Universal and Perpetual Peace]]", part IV of ''[[Principles of International Law]]'' (1786–89), [[Jeremy Bentham]] proposed that disarmament, arbitration, and the renunciation of colonies would produce perpetual peace,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.laits.utexas.edu/poltheory/bentham/pil/pil.e04.html |title=A Plan for an Universal and Perpetual Peace |work=The Principles of International Law |first=Jeremy |last=Bentham}}&lt;/ref&gt; thus relying merely on Kant's preliminary articles and on none of the three main points; contrary to the modern theorists, he relied on public opinion, even against the [[absolute monarchy in Sweden]].

Since 2008, the Perpetual Peace Project—a partnership between the [[European Union National Institutes for Culture]] (EUNIC), the [[International Peace Institute]] (IPI), the [[United Nations University]], [[Slought Foundation]], and [[Syracuse University]]—is engaging Kant's essay in an ongoing philosophical and curatorial initiative that is conceptualized around ultimately "re-writing" Kant's 1795 treatise,&lt;ref&gt;"Gregg Lambert presents the Perpetual Peace Project" &lt;{{cite web |url=https://iah.unc.edu/events/calendar/2012/lecture-gregg-lambert-presents-the-perpetual-peace-project |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-04-05 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141017193441/https://iah.unc.edu/events/calendar/2012/lecture-gregg-lambert-presents-the-perpetual-peace-project |archivedate=2014-10-17 |df= }}&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt; as well as a republication of the essay.&lt;ref&gt;Utrecht University 'Perpetual Peace Project' &lt;http://www.uu.nl/faculty/humanities/NL/centreforthehumanities/nieuws/Pages/20121122cfh-Perpetual-Peace-Project-2013.aspx&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt; Thinking through the ideas behind the project and its links to Kant, [[Gregg Lambert]], Aaron Levy, and Martin Rauchbauer rely on the secret article contained in the second supplement which "is detached from the main body of the public treatise that outlines the preliminary and definitive articles, and offered as a secret pact".&lt;ref&gt;Lambert, Gregg, Levy, Aaron, and Rauchbauer, Martin "The Idea of Perpetual Peace" &lt;http://perpetualpeaceproject.org/idea.php&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; They draw on the ironic tone of Kant's writing to argue that the treatise performs the idea that the conditions for peace are best considered silently. Secretly, that is, statesmen and politicians can take the idea of peace seriously, since it will never be associated with them. As such, the project brings together theorists and practitioners, such as diplomats, policy experts, philosophers, and artists, in order to revisit 21st century prospects for international peace through Kant's essay, in order to "change people's minds, get them to take the idea seriously, start to imagine what it would be like to live in a peaceful society".&lt;ref&gt;Syracuse University News, Sep 5, 2012, "Two Minutes With Gregg Lambert" &lt;http://asnews.syr.edu/newsevents_2012/releases/gregg_lambert_interview.html&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt; The Perpetual Peace Project finds its public form in symposia, exhibitions, lectures, as well as a feature film.&lt;ref&gt;Project website: &lt;http://perpetualpeaceproject.org/&gt;.

The '''Russell–Einstein Manifesto''' was issued in London on 9 July 1955 by [[Bertrand Russell]] in the midst of the [[Cold War]]. It highlighted the dangers posed by [[nuclear weapons]] and called for world leaders to seek peaceful resolutions to international conflict. The signatories included eleven pre-eminent intellectuals and scientists, including [[Albert Einstein]], who signed it just days before his death on 18 April 1955. A few days after the release, philanthropist [[Cyrus S. Eaton]] offered to sponsor a conference—called for in the manifesto—in [[Pugwash, Nova Scotia]], Eaton's birthplace. This conference was to be the first of the [[Pugwash Conferences on Science and World Affairs]], held in July 1957.

==Background==
{{main|History of nuclear weapons|Atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki}}
The first detonation of an atomic weapon took place on 16 July 1945 in the desert north of [[Alamogordo]], [[New Mexico]]. On 6 August 1945, the US dropped ''[[Little Boy]]'' on the Japanese city of [[Hiroshima]] and, three days later, ''[[Fat Man]]'' on [[Nagasaki, Nagasaki|Nagasaki]]. At least 100,000 civilians were killed outright by these two bombings.

On 18 August 1945, the ''Glasgow Forward'' published "The Bomb and Civilisation," the first known recorded comment by Bertrand Russell on atomic weapons, which he began composing the day Nagasaki was bombed. It contained threads that would later appear in the manifesto:

{{Quote|The prospect for the human race is sombre beyond all precedent. Mankind are faced with a clear-cut alternative: either we shall all perish, or we shall have to acquire some slight degree of common sense. A great deal of new political thinking will be necessary if utter disaster is to be averted.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.personal.kent.edu/~rmuhamma/Philosophy/RBwritings/bombCivilization.htm Bertrand Russell, "The Bomb and Civilisation."]&lt;/ref&gt;}}

After learning of the bombing of Hiroshima and seeing an impending [[nuclear arms race]], [[Joseph Rotblat]], the only scientist to leave the [[Manhattan Project]] on moral grounds, remarked that he "became worried about the whole future of mankind".

Over the years that followed Russell and Rotblat worked on efforts to curb nuclear proliferation, collaborating with Albert Einstein and other scientists to compose what became known as the '''Russell–Einstein Manifesto'''.

==Press conference, 9 July 1955==
The manifesto was released during a press conference at [[Caxton Hall]], London. Rotblat, who chaired the meeting, describes it as follows:

{{Quote|It was thought that only a few of the Press would turn up and a small room was booked in Caxton Hall for the Press Conference. But it soon became clear that interest was increasing and the next larger room was booked. In the end the largest room was taken and on the day of the Conference this was packed to capacity with representatives of the press, radio and television from all over the world. After reading the Manifesto, Russell answered a barrage of questions from members of the press, some of whom were initially openly hostile to the ideas contained in the Manifesto. Gradually, however, they became convinced by the forcefulness of his arguments, as was evident in the excellent reporting in the Press, which in many cases gave front page coverage.}}

Russell had begun the conference by stating:

{{Quote|I am bringing the warning pronounced by the signatories to the notice of all the powerful Governments of the world in the earnest hope that they may agree to allow their citizens to survive.}}

==Synopsis==
The manifesto called for a conference where scientists would assess the dangers posed to the survival of humanity by [[weapons of mass destruction]]. Emphasis was placed on the meeting being politically neutral. It extended the question of nuclear weapons to all people and governments. One particular phrase is quoted often, including by Rotblat upon receipt of the [[Nobel Peace Prize]] in 1995:

{{Quote|Remember your humanity, and forget the rest.}}

==The beginnings of the Pugwash Conferences==
The manifesto called for an international conference, and was originally planned by [[Jawaharlal Nehru]] to be held in [[India]]. This was delayed by the outbreak of the [[Suez Crisis]]. [[Aristotle Onassis]] offered to finance a meeting in [[Monaco]], but this was rejected. Instead, Cyrus Eaton, a Canadian industrialist who had known Russell since 1938, offered to finance the conference in his hometown of Pugwash, Nova Scotia. The '''Russell–Einstein Manifesto''' became the [[Pugwash Conferences]]' founding charter. The first of the conferences was held in July 1957 in London.

A '''self-regulatory organization''' ('''SRO''') is an organization that exercises some degree of regulatory authority over an industry or profession. The regulatory authority could exist in place of government regulation, or applied in addition to government regulation.  The ability of an SRO to exercise regulatory authority does not necessarily derive from a grant of authority from the government.

In United States securities law, a self-regulatory organization is a defined term. The principal federal regulatory authority—the [[Securities and Exchange Commission]] (SEC)—was established by the Federal [[Securities Exchange Act of 1934]].  The SEC originally delegated authority to the [[Financial Industry Regulatory Authority|Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA)]] and to the [[List of stock exchanges#United States of America|national stock exchanges]] (e.g., the [[New York Stock Exchange|NYSE]]) to enforce certain industry standards and requirements related to securities trading and brokerage. On July 26, 2007 the SEC approved a merger of the enforcement arms of the NYSE and the NASD, to form a new SRO, the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA).  In addition, Congress created the [[Municipal Securities Rulemaking Board]] (MSRB) as an SRO charged with adopting investor protection rules governing broker-dealers and banks that underwrite, trade and sell tax-exempt bonds, 529 college savings plans and other types of municipal securities.

The [[American Arbitration Association]] is also an SRO with official, statutory status.

Because of the prominence of the SROs in the securities industry, the term SRO is often used too narrowly to describe an organization authorized by statute or government agency to exercise control over a certain aspect of the industry.

The [[National Association of Realtors]] (NAR) is an example of an SRO that fills the vacuum left by the absence of government oversight or regulation.  The NAR sets the rules for [[multiple listing service]]s and how brokers use them.  Another example is the [[American Medical Association]] which sets rules for ethics, conflicts, disciplinary action, and accreditation in medicine.

'''Seong Hon''' (1535 – 1598) was a [[Neo-Confucianism|Neo-Confucian]] scholar, politician, and educator of Korea's [[Joseon Dynasty]]. He was a close friend of the scholar [[Yi I]] (Yulgok) and an older contemporary of [[Yi Hwang]] (Toegye), leader of the country's "western faction" (''seoin'' 서인, 西人) of the period.&lt;ref&gt;Daehwan, Noh. [http://www.ekoreajournal.net/upload/html/HTML43412.html "The Eclectic Development of Neo-Confucianism and Statecraft from the 18th to the 19th Century,"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110614035130/http://www.ekoreajournal.net/upload/html/HTML43412.html |date=2011-06-14 }} ''Korea Journal.'' Winter 2003.&lt;/ref&gt;

Seong Hon is often referred to by his [[pen name|stylized name]] of '''Ugye''' ("bull valley") and '''Mugam''' ("black stone"). He gained eminence not only as a scholar but as a revered politician and reformer, attaining the position of Fourth State Councillor/Vice Prime Minister (''Jwachanseong'' 左贊成) in the Joseon State Council (''uijeongbu'').&lt;ref name="Seong Hon doosan"&gt;{{ko}} [http://100.naver.com/100.nhn?docid=92484 Seong Hon] at [[Doosan Encyclopedia]]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Solomon Dodashvili''' ({{lang-ka|სოლომონ დოდაშვილი}}) also known as '''Solomon Ivanovich Dodaev-Mogarsky''' ({{lang-ru|Соломон Иванович Додаев-Могарский}}) (May 17, 1805 – August 20, 1836) was a [[Georgia (country)|Georgian]] philosopher, journalist, historian, grammarian, [[Belles-lettres|belletrist]] and enlightener.

Dodashvili was born in Magharo, [[Kakheti]], [[Georgia (country)|Georgia]], then part of [[Imperial Russia]]. Having graduated from [[St Petersburg University]] in 1827, he obtained a [[Magister (degree)|Magister]] degree in philosophy there in 1828. During his stay in the Russian capital, he was close to [[Decembrist]] ideas and witnessed their 1825 mutiny. In 1828, Dodashvili returned to [[Tiflis]], where he worked as an educator. He composed histories, grammars, and summaries of philosophy for his young pupils and led them into political opposition to the Russian rule. His idealistic pedagogues influenced many Georgian intellectuals and poets, including [[Nikoloz Baratashvili]], who combined modern nationalism with European [[Romanticism]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Donald Rayfield]] (2000), ''[[The Literature of Georgia: A History]]'', p. 145. Routledge (UK), {{ISBN|0-7007-1163-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the same time, from 1828 to 1832, he edited the first Georgian-language newspaper "Tp’ilisis utsk’ebani", a weekly addition to the Russian "Tiflisskie Vedomosti".

His career was terminated by the failure of the [[1832 Georgian plot|1832 conspiracy]] against the Russian hegemony, in which he was a participant. Unlike most of his coconspirators, who seconded the [[Monarchism in Georgia|restoration of Georgian monarchy]], he proposed a republic as a form of government. Arrested by police, he was deported to Russia proper. He was kept in captivity in [[Kirov, Kirov Oblast|Vyatka]] and died there of [[tuberculosis]]. He was reburied to [[Mtatsminda Pantheon]], Tbilisi, in 1994.&lt;ref&gt;{{ru icon}} [http://magazines.russ.ru/druzhba/2000/10/dodaeva.html Соломон вернулся на родину, an excerpt from a book by Anzhelika Dodaeva-Magarskaya], his descendant.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Claromontanus Stichometry Leaf 468v.jpg|thumb|300px|'''A List of Total Line Counts for Christian Texts:''' The title is 'Versus Scribturarum Sanctarum' or 'Lines of Holy Scriptures.' The second line says 'Genesis Versus IIIId' or 'Genesis Lines 4500.' The third line says 'Exodus Versus IIIdcc (= 3700). From the [[Codex Claromontanus]] (5th or 6th century CE), Leaf 467v, National Library, Paris, France.]]

'''Stichometry''' refers to the practice of counting lines in texts: Ancient Greeks and Romans measured the length of their books in lines, just as modern books are measured in pages. This practice was rediscovered by German and French scholars in the 19th century. ''Stichos'' is the Greek word for a 'line' of prose or poetry and the suffix '-metry' is derived from the Greek word for measurement.

The length of each line in the ''Iliad'' and ''Odyssey'', which may have been among the first long, Greek texts written down, became the standard unit for ancient stichometry. This '''standard line''' (''Normalzeile'', in German)  was thus as long as an epic hexameter and contained about 15 syllables or 35 Greek letters.&lt;ref&gt;Kurt Ohly, ''Stichometrische Untersuchungen'' (Leipzig: Otto Harrassowitz, 1928), ch. I.&lt;/ref&gt;

Stichometry existed for several reasons. Scribes were paid by the line and their fee per line was sometimes fixed by legal decree. Authors occasionally cited passages in the works of other authors by giving their approximate line number. Book buyers used total line counts to check that copied texts were complete. Library catalogs listed the total number of lines in each work along with the title and author.&lt;ref&gt;Ohly, ''Stichometrische Untersuchungen'', ch. IV.&lt;/ref&gt;

Scholars believe that stichometry became established in Athens sometime during the 5th century BCE when copying prose works became common. Stichometry is mentioned briefly in [[Plato]]'s ''Laws'' (c. 347 BCE),&lt;ref&gt;Plato, ''Laws'', 958e9 – 959a1. See Ohly's analysis, p. 92-3.&lt;/ref&gt; several times in [[Isocrates]] (early to mid-4th century),&lt;ref&gt;For example, Isocrates says in his prose ''Panathenaicus'' (136, c. 340 BCE) that his composition is fit only for an audience that would countenance long speeches that even extended up ‘to a length of 10,000 hexameters.’&lt;/ref&gt; and in [[Theopompus]] (late 4th to early 3rd century),&lt;ref&gt;Theopompus (c. 380 – c. 315 BCE) congratulated himself for writing display speeches of not less than 20,000 lines and then for writing another 150,000 lines about the relations of barbarians and Hellenes to each other. Photius Bibliotheca, cod. 176, p. 120b, fragment 30B = Fragments of Greek Historians, F 25.&lt;/ref&gt; but these casual references suggest the practice was already routine. The same standard line was used for stichometry among the Greeks and Romans for about a thousand years until stichometry apparently fell out of use among the Byzantine Greeks in the Middle Ages as page numbers became more common.&lt;ref&gt;Ohly, ch. IV. The decline of stichometry is also briefly discussed in Llewelyn Morgan, ''Patterns of Redemption in Virgil's Georgics'' (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1999), p. 224.&lt;/ref&gt;

The standard work on stichometry is Kurt Ohly's 1928 ''Stichometrische Untersuchungen''&lt;ref&gt;Kurt Ohly, ''Stichometrische Untersuchungen'' (Leipzig: Otto Harrassowitz, 1928).&lt;/ref&gt; which collects together the results of some fifty years of scholarly debate and research. Today, stichometry plays a small but useful role in research in fields as diverse as the history of the ancient book, papyrology, and Christian hermeneutics.

==Definitions==
There are two kinds of stichometry: '''total stichometry''' is the practice of reporting the total number of lines in a work. '''Partial stichometry''' is the practice of including a series of numerals in the margins of a text, usually to mark every hundredth line.

Stichometry was sometimes confused with colometry, the practice of some Christian authors in late antiquity of writing texts broken into rhetorical phrases to aid delivery. Some modern Jewish and Christian scholars use ‘stichometry’ as a synonym for ‘stichography,’ which is the occasional practice in ancient scriptures of laying out texts so that each biblical or poetic verse begins on a new line.&lt;ref&gt;Both terms are used in E. Tov, ‘The Background of the Different Stichometric Arrangements of Poetry in the Judean Desert Texts,’ in J. Penner, K. Penner, C. Wassen, editors, ''Prayer and Poetry in the Dead Sea Scrolls and Related Literature'' (Leiden: Brill Academic Publishing, 2011), pp. 409 -- 420. For the distinction, see James Kugel, ''The Idea of Biblical Poetry: Parallelism and Its History'', (Baltimore: Johns Hopkins University Press, 1998).&lt;/ref&gt;

==Evidence for stichometry==

[[File:Charles Graux (1852--1882).jpg|thumb|left|'''Charles Graux (1852--1882):''' French classicist and [[palaeography|palaeographer]]. His discovery of the standard line launched the rigorous, modern study of stichometry.]]

The libraries of Europe contain many medieval copies of ancient Greek and Latin texts. Many of these contain short notes or 'subscriptions' on the final page that, in hundreds of cases, give the total number of lines in the work.&lt;ref&gt;There is a survey in Graux, ‘Nouvelles Recherches sur la Stichométrie,’ ''Revue de Philologie'', new series 2, 1878, pp. 97 – 143.&lt;/ref&gt; In texts of classical authors such as [[Herodotus]] and [[Demosthenes]], these totals are expressed in the older, [[Attic numerals|acrophonic numerals]] that were used in Athens during the classical period but abandoned sometime during the Hellenistic period.&lt;ref&gt;See W. Larfeld, ''Griechische Epigraphik'', 3rd edition, 1914.&lt;/ref&gt; Thus these stichometric totals are thought to descend, along with the content of the texts, from very early editions.&lt;ref&gt;See Mirko Canevaro, ''The Documents in the Attic Orators'' (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2013).&lt;/ref&gt;

Many ancient authors mention stichometry. [[Galen]] complains about the verbosity of a rival and says he can offer a description in fewer lines.&lt;ref&gt;Galen, ''Adversus eos qui de typis scripserunt'' (Köhn, vol. VII, pp. 475-512); see Ohly, p. 5.&lt;/ref&gt; In the 1st century BCE, a philosopher criticized [[Zeno of Citium]] and cited particular passages by giving their line number to the nearest hundredth line.&lt;ref&gt;Ohly (p. 109 ff.) argues the citations by line number in Diogenes Laertius (VII 33, VII 188, etc.) derive from a 1st-century BCE critic.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Diogenes Laertius]] probably draws on the ''Pinakes'', the published catalogue of the Library of Alexandria, when he reports the total number of lines in the oeuvres of various authors. He says, for example, that [[Speusippus]] wrote 43,475, [[Aristotle]] wrote 445,270, and [[Theophrastus]] wrote 232,808 lines.&lt;ref&gt;Diogenes Laertius, IV 5, V 27, and V 50.&lt;/ref&gt; The Cheltenham Canon lists line totals for books in the Christian Bible and concludes with an anonymous note apparently written by a book dealer in the 4th century CE when the practice of stichometry was perhaps becoming less familiar:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
Since the list of line totals [of the books in the Bible available] in the city of Rome is not reliable,  and elsewhere because of greed is not complete,  I have gone through each individual book, counting 16 syllables to the line (as used in Virgil), and recorded the number for each book in all of them.&lt;ref&gt;Sanday, ‘The Cheltenham List of the Canonical Books of the New Testament and of the Writings of Cyprian,’ ''Studia Biblica et Ecclesiastica'', III, Oxford, 1891, pp. 217-325.&lt;/ref&gt; 
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Beginning in the 19th century, archaeologists discovered a large number of more or less fragmentary Greek scrolls in Egypt. Ohly describes and analyzes some fifty papryi which provide direct, ancient evidence for total and partial stichometry.

==Modern rediscovery==

[[File:Philedemus Herculaneum subscription enhance.jpg|thumb|right|400px|'''Total Stichometry on a Papyrus Column:''' A line count in the subscription on the last column of a text by the philosopher [[Philodemus]] (1st century BCE). The first line says 'ΦΙΛΟΔΗΜ[ΟΥ]' or 'By Philodemus' (brackets around restored characters). The second says '[ΠΕΡΙ ΡΗΤ]ΟΡΙΚΗϹ' or 'On Rhetoric.' The last says 'XXXXHH' or '4200 [lines].' Transcription of papyrus charred by the eruption of Vesuvius in 79 CE and excavated at [[Herculaneum]] (Oxford, 1824).]]

[[Friedrich Wilhelm Ritschl|Friedrich Ritschl]], a leading German classicist in the mid-19th century, stimulated interest in the mysterious numerals found at the end of medieval manuscripts by discussing them in several of his essays.&lt;ref&gt;See, for example, F. Ritschl, '‘Die Stichometrie der Alten,’ in ''Opuscula Philologica'' (Leipzig, 1866), vol. I, pp. 74--112.&lt;/ref&gt;

In an 1878 article that Ohly called ‘epoch-making,’ [[Charles Graux (classicist)|Charles Graux]] proved that the numerals at the end of the medieval manuscripts were proportional to the length of each work and in fact gave the total number of a fixed unit equal to a Homeric line.&lt;ref&gt;The article ‘Nouvelles Recherches sur la Stichométrie’ first appeared in the ''Revue de Philologie'', new series 2, 1878, pp. 97 – 143 and was reprinted in ''Les Articles Originaux''. ‘Epoch-making’: see Ohly, p. 95.&lt;/ref&gt; This discovery established the concept of the standard line.

While studying the Clarke Codex of Plato's dialogues at Oxford, [[Martin Schanz]] noticed that isolated letters in the margins of two dialogues formed an alphabetic series and marked every hundredth standard line (alpha = 100, beta = 200, etc.). He was able to show that other manuscripts had similar marginal markings. His 1881 article named this kind of line-counting 'partial stichometry' and contrasted it to 'total stichometry' studied by Graux.&lt;ref&gt;Martin Schanz, ‘Zur Stichometrie,’ ''Hermes'', vol. 16, no. 2, 1881, pp. 309 – 315.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Theodor Birt]]'s well-known ''The Nature of the Ancient Book'' (1882)&lt;ref&gt;''Das antike Buchwesen in seinem Verhältnis zur Literatur'', 1882.&lt;/ref&gt; substantially widened research on stichometry. Birt saw that Graux's breakthrough led to a cascade of insights about scribal practices and publishing, citations and intertextuality, and the kinds of formats and editions used in antiquity. Stichometry thus led to a broader study of the spatial organization of ancient books and their social, economic, and intellectual roles. As [[Hermann Alexander Diels|Hermann Diels]] said,
&lt;blockquote&gt;
The investigations of the recently deceased Charles Graux, taken all too prematurely from the world of scholarship, have made it henceforth inalterably certain that the standard line (the ''stichos'') of the ancients was a unit of spatial length equal to the hexameter. Theodor Birt has rightly erected his shrewd and persuasive ''The Nature of the Ancient Book'' upon this foundation.&lt;ref&gt;H. Diels, 'Stichometrisches,' ''Hermes'', vol. 17, no. 3, 1882, p. 377.&lt;/ref&gt; 
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
Birt's 550-page work was stimulated by practical questions about the ancient culture of books but grew into a broad reevaluation and reorganization of our knowledge of ancient literature and intellectual life. His introduction argued:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
The nature of the literature of antiquity and the form of the ancient book reciprocally conditioned each other. The context of publication enveloped and modified literary creativity. The dividends of these investigations will thereby far exceed the satisfaction of merely antiquarian pleasures.&lt;ref&gt;''Das antike Buchwesen'', p. 502.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
Many of Birt's theories and interpretations are dated and have been superseded by later research, but he permanently broadened and deepened the methodologies used in histories of the ancient book and connected stichometry to a broad range of intellectual and literary issues.&lt;ref&gt;For a discussion of the development of the field, see {{cite book|last1=Roberts|first1=Colin H.|last2=Skeat|first2=T.C.|title=The birth of the codex|date=1987|publisher=Published for The British Academy by Oxford University Press|location=London|isbn=0197260616|edition=Repr.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1893, James Rendel Harris' book ''Stichometry'' extended these new developments to an analysis of the stichometric data found in many early manuscripts of the Christian Bible and other Christian texts.&lt;ref&gt;James Rendel Harris, ''Stichometry'' (London: C.J. Clay &amp; Sons, 1893).&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1909, Domenico Bassi published a survey of the stichometric notations found on the papyri excavated at Herculaneum.&lt;ref&gt;Domenico Bassi, ‘La Sticometria Nei Papiri Ercolanesi,’ ''Revista di Filologia'', vol. 37, no. 3, 1909,  pp. 321 --  363 (Internet Archive).&lt;/ref&gt;

At the end of the 19th and beginning of the 20th centuries, archaeologists discovered a large number of fragmentary, Greek scrolls in Egyptian tombs, mummies, and city dumps. Some of these contained stichometric notations, and papyrologists became interested in the question of whether this data provided clues that would aid in reassembling the fragments. Kurt Ohly studied the stichometry found in many of the scrolls excavated at [[Herculaneum]] in Italy but his 1929 book ''Stichometrische Untersuchungen''&lt;ref&gt;Kurt Ohly, ''Stichometrische Untersuchungen'' (Leipzig: Otto Harrassowitz, 1928).&lt;/ref&gt; contained a complete survey of the treasure trove of newly discovered Greco-Egyptian papyri with stichometric notations. It is regarded as the standard work on stichometry. Ohly discusses the length of the standard line, the evidence for syllable counting, the various number systems used in stichometric reports, and the aims and history of stichometry among the Greeks, Romans, and Byzantines.  Ohly's catalog of ancient papyri with stichometry together with Bassi's survey and the line reports in medieval manuscripts collected by Graux provide a wide range of evidence for ancient stichometric practices and their evolution through the centuries.

==Recent research and applications==

[[File:Clark Symp 210v lambda crop.jpg|thumb|400px|'''Partial stichometry in Plato:''' The lambda in the margin means 'line 1100' since lambda is the eleventh letter in the Greek alphabet. The Greeks used letters of the alphabet for numerals but decorated them to distinguish them from ordinary letters, here with a two bars and two dots. The same stichometric notations appear in another Plato manuscript and they probably derive from an early edition.&lt;ref&gt;Martin Schanz, ‘Zur Stichometrie,’ ''Hermes'', vol. 16, no. 2, 1881, p. 313. Schanz argued the Venetus manuscript was not a descendent of the Clarke Codex.&lt;/ref&gt; Clarke Codex of Plato's Dialogues, copied in 895 CE, Bodleian Library, Oxford University, leaf 210v, detail.]]

Rudolf Blum summarized research on stichometry in the catalog of Callimachus at the Library of Alexandria.&lt;ref&gt;Rudolf Blum, ''Kallimachos: The Alexandrian Library and the Origins of Bibliography'' (Madison: University of Wisconsin Press, 1991), trans. H. H. Wellisch, pp. 157-8.&lt;/ref&gt;

Holger Essler (University of Würzburg) discussed stichometry's role in the ongoing efforts to reconstruct the papyri excavated at Herculaneum.&lt;ref&gt;Holger Essler, ‘Rekonstruktion von Papyrus Rollen auf Mathematischer Grundlage,’ ''Cronache Ercolanesi'', vol. 38, 2008, pp. 273 – 308.&lt;/ref&gt;

Dirk Obbink (Oxford University) used stichometry in his restoration of Philodemus' ''On Piety''.&lt;ref&gt;See, for example, Dirk Obbink, editor, ''Philodemus: On Piety'', Part 1 (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 1997).&lt;/ref&gt;

Jay Kennedy (Manchester University) claimed in several articles&lt;ref&gt;For example, J. Kennedy, ‘Plato's Forms, Pythagorean Mathematics, and Stichometry,’ ''Apeiron'', vol. 43, no. 1, Mar. 2010, p. 1 -- 32.&lt;/ref&gt; and a book, ''The Musical Structure of Plato's Dialogues'',&lt;ref&gt;Jay Kennedy, ''The Musical Structure of Plato's Dialogues'' (Durham: Acumen, 2012).&lt;/ref&gt; that Plato counted the lines in his dialogues in order to insert symbolic passages at regular intervals and thereby formed various musical and Pythagorean patterns.

Rachel Yuen-Collingridge and Malcolm Choat (Macquarie University) used stichometry along with other kinds of evidence to make inferences about scribal practice and copying techniques.&lt;ref&gt;Rachel Yuen-Collingridge and Malcolm Choat, ‘The Copyist at Work, Scribal Practice in Duplicate Documents,’ in Paul Schubert, editor, ''Actes du 26&lt;sup&gt;e&lt;/sup&gt; Congrès international de papyrologie'', in the series Recherches et Rencontres published by the Faculté des Lettres de l’Université de Genève, 2012, Volume 30, 827–834.&lt;/ref&gt;

Mirko Canevaro (Durham University) argued that the stichometric totals in the Demosthenes manuscripts descended from the earliest editions. He used these totals to show that the supposed excerpts of documentary evidence inserted in the speeches were not present in those early editions and were thus late forgeries. His book, ''The Documents in the Attic Orators'', includes an introduction to stichometry.&lt;ref&gt;Mirko Canevaro, ''The Documents in the Attic Orators'' (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2013).&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Sufi studies''' is a particular branch of [[comparative studies]] that uses the technical lexicon of the Islamic mystics, the [[Sufism|Sufis]], to exemplify the nature of its ideas; hence the frequent reference to [[Tariqa|Sufi Orders]]. It may be divided into two main branches, the [[oriental studies|orientalist]]/[[academic]] and the spiritual.

==Early Sufi studies in France==
The earliest Europeans to study Sufism were French, associated (rightly or wrongly) with the [[Quietism (Christian philosophy)|Quietist]] movement. They were [[Barthélemy d'Herbelot de Molainville]] (1625–1695), a professor at the [[Collège de France]] who worked from texts available in Europe, [[François Bernier]] (1625–1688), the physician of the [[Mughal Empire|Mughal]] emperor [[Aurangzeb]] who spent 1655-69 in the Islamic world (mostly with Aurangzeb), and [[François Pétis de la Croix]] (1653–1713), a diplomat who spent 1674-1676 in [[Isfahan (city)|Isfahan]], where he studied [[Rumi]]'s ''[[Masnavi-ye Manavi]]'' and visited the [[Bektashi]] order.

D'Herbelot's great work, the ''Bibliothèque orientale'' (published posthumously in 1697), included an entry on [[Sufism]] (as ''tasawwuf'') and detailed entries on [[Al-Hallaj]], [[Najmeddin Kubra]], and [[Abd-al-karim Jili]]. There were a number of references to the ''Masnavi'' and to Rumi (as Gellaledin Mohammed al Balkhi), and there may also have been entries on them.

Bernier published an article on Sufism entitled "Mémoire sur le quïetisme des Indes" in the periodical ''Histoire des Ouvrages des Savans'' in September 1688. Following this article, there is said to have developed in France a view that the French expression of the creed of Pure Love (Pur Amour/[[Quietism (Christian philosophy)|Quietism]]) was in fact a disguised form of [[Islam]].  The debate over Quietism between the bishops [[Fénelon]] and [[Jacques-Bénigne Bossuet|Bossuet]] was remembered as the "Querelle du Pur Amour". Many Quietists (including [[Jeanne Marie Bouvier de la Motte Guyon]]) were imprisoned. Others exercised caution and self-censorship.

Pétis de la Croix did not publish himself, but his son (writing later under a pseudonym) gave reasons why he thought "the [[Mevlevi]] are perfect Quïetists" (Ahmed Frangui, ''Lettres critiques de Hadgi Effendi à la Marquise de G... au sujet des mémoires de M. le Chevalier d'Arvieux'', Paris, 1735).

D'Herbelot de Molainville's ''Bibliothèque orientale'' went through several editions, one of the last of which was the 1777 edition printed in the Hague. It has been suggested that some entries on Sufi topics that were present in the 1697 edition were absent from the 1777 edition. The word "Sufi" appears (vol 3, p.&amp;nbsp;329).

==Early translations==
In 1671, Edward Pococke (1648–1727), the son of Oxford professor [[Edward Pococke]] (1604–1691), published a Latin translation of the ''Hayy Ibn Yakhthan'' of [[Ibn Tufayl]]. This led to a number of other translations, including the English translations of 1674 (by George Keith) and 1686 (by George Ashwell), and a Dutch translation of 1701. The anonymous Dutch translator, "S.D.B.", gave a concise biographical review of the philosophers related to the text: [[Al Farabi]], [[Avicenna]], [[Al Ghazali]], [[Ibn Bajjah]], [[Ibn Rushd]], [[Junayd]], and [[Mansur Al-Hallaj]] (with a description of his death and a reference to his famous "Ana al-Haqq"). ''Hayy Ibn Yakhthan'' may have partly inspired [[Robinson Crusoe]].

In 1812, [[Joseph von Hammer-Purgstall]] published a translation of the ''divan'' of [[Hafiz Shirazi|Hafiz]], which was received with delight by [[Goethe]], who was inspired by it to publish in 1819 his ''Westöstlicher Diwan''. A Sufi appears in [[Gotthold Ephraim Lessing]]’s play ''[[Nathan der Weise]]'', first produced in 1779, though it is not clear from where Lessing learned of Sufism, perhaps through his association with [[Johann Jakob Reiske]].

In 1821, F.A.G. Thölluck published ''Ssufismus sive Theosophia persarum pantheistica'' in Berlin (in Latin).

==Early sociological studies==
One of the earliest sociological treatments of Sufism is to be found in Sir [[John Malcolm]]'s 1825 work, ''The History of Persia, From the Most Early Period to the Present Time, Containing an Account of the Religion, Government, Usages and Character of the Inhabitants of that Kingdom''. Malcolm's treatment, though interesting, is not well informed.

In ''An Account of the Manners and Customs of the Modern Egyptians written in Egypt during the years 1833-1835'' (1836) [[Edward William Lane]] noted, and illustrated with his own woodcuts, his close observations of the [[Rifa'i]] derwishes while living in Cairo "in disguise". The success of his work also introduced the success of the "disguise". [[Sir Richard Burton]]'s ''Personal Narrative of a Pilgrimage to El-Medinah and Meccah'' (3 vol.1855-1856) was undertaken while travelling as a [[Qadiri]], and [[Armin Vambéry]] reached Baveddin near [[Bokhara]] to visit the shrine of [[Baha-ud-Din Naqshband Bukhari]] in 1863 in the guise of a [[murid]]. ''Voyage dans l'Asie Centrale, de Téhéran a Khiva, Bokhara et Samarkand, par Arminius Vambéry, savant Hongrois déguisé en derviche'' was the subject of four instalments of the popular and copiously illustrated "Le Tour Du Monde, Nouveau Journal Des Voyages ([[Édouard Charton]])" Paris, Londres, Leipzig 1865, deuxième semestre -Hachette et Cie ed.

The "disguise" was by no means superficial and necessitated a variety of resources in linguistics and social integration that left marks far beyond the mere popular success of [[Travel literature|travelogues]].

Towards the end of the 19th century, the resistance to the European conquest of North Africa was often led by Sufis, notably [[Abd al-Qadir al-Jaza'iri|Abd al-Qadir]] and later the [[Senussi|Sanusi]] order. This drew further attention to Sufis and Sufism, and a number of studies were performed and published. These generally suffered from their authors' preoccupations with security.

==Aguéli to Guénon==
One line of 20th century Sufi studies that came to fruition in the West appears to have been born from many [[colors]] in a painters workshop.&lt;ref&gt;[[Talk:Idries Shah#Shah on Naqshbandi]]&lt;/ref&gt; It was the Swedish painter [[Ivan Aguéli]] [http://www.sala.se/turism/aguelimuseet/e-index.html] who – inspired by the quasi occult tradition ([[Symbolist painters]], [[Les Nabis]]) developing ''en marge'' of the great workshops of [[Paul Gauguin]] and [[Émile Bernard (painter)|Émile Bernard]] – took his intellectual search into the realm of [[Sufism]] proper. This culminated into his initiation, in [[Egypt]], by Sheikh Rahman Elish Kabir into the [[Shadhili]] [[tariqa]].

When he returned to [[Paris]] from his travels in the East in 1909, he found a mind receptive to his own spiritual affiliation in the [[person]] of [[René Guénon]] whom in turn he initiated into the [[Shadhili]] Order (1912).[[René Guénon]] – who finally settled in [[Cairo]] where he died (1951) a convert to Islam under his adopted name of Abdel Wahid Yahia – had an enormous influence on a circle of friends centered around the periodical "La Gnose", that he had started in 1909. This circle pooled the resources of a.o. [[Frithjof Schuon]], [[Titus Burckhardt]], [[Marco Pallis]], [[Ananda Coomaraswamy]], [[Martin Lings]] e.a., each with his own focus on [[Islam]], [[Buddhism]], [[Hinduism]] ... (see also: [[Gershom Scholem]] on [[Judaism]], [[Kabbalah]])

[[René Guénon]] focused on a measure of criticism towards what he called "solidified" (petrified) forms of initiation in the West; [[Freemasonry]] in particular which he sought to revive in reference to Emir [[Abd al-Qadir al-Jaza'iri|Abd Al-Qadir]] whose name was widely respected among Masons.

If one looks at the aspect of Sufi initiation proper the following background to [[René Guénon]]'s brand of "Perennial Tradition" emerges. Through his affiliation with the [[Shadhili]] Order he was branched to the Akbari chain, going back to the "Greatest Sheikh" – Shaykh Al-Akbar – [[Ibn Arabi]].

Seminal research on the inspiration of Ibn Arabi and the Shadili and its projection in the works of [[Dante]] and [[St John of the Cross]] came from the great Christian scholar [[Miguel Asín Palacios]]

==Abd Al-Qadir and al-Tijani==
The Akbari already had a history of initiation in Western Europe in the person of Emir [[Abd al-Qadir al-Jaza'iri|Abd Al-Qadir]], the noble opponent of the French in their colonial struggle over Algeria, who they had held sequestered at the [[Château d'Amboise]] (1848–1853). In 1858 the Imprimerie Nationale (Paris) had printed his "Rappel à l'Intelligent; avis
à l'Ignorant", an essay he had sent to the Société Asiatique in 1855.

The Emir [[Abd al-Qadir al-Jaza'iri|Abd Al-Qadir]] had been initiated into the [[Naqshbandi]] by Sheikh Diya al-Din Khalid Al-Sharazuri and into the [[Qadiri]] by his own father Sidi Muhiuddin who led a North African branch of the Qadiri Order. In 1863, during his Hajj, he met with Muhammed al-Fasi al-Shadili, who became his last living teacher, in Mekka. Muhammad al-Fasi al-Shadili's proper teacher had been initiated into the [[Shadhili]] by al-Arabi ad-Darqawi, some of whose letters were translated by [[Martin Lings]] (1961); they form the background to [[Martin Lings]]' outline of the autobiographical writings of [[Ahmad al-Alawi]], who was linked to the [[Shadhili]] through ad-Darqawi. Sheikh Ahmad al-Alawi died in 1932.

An approach from a different angle may be traced to Sheikh [[Tijaniyyah|Ahmad al-Tijani]] who died in [[Fes, Morocco|Fez]] in 1815 and was said to be the inheritor of the "paths" of his time, a.o. Qadiri and Shadili.

Sheikh Hammalah ben Mohammed ben Sidna Omar, who died in forced exile to France, lies buried in Montluçon, [[France]]. He was the former Qutub al Zaman of the [[Tijaniyyah]]. A moving account of the circumstances of his death is given by the great African traditionalist and cultural ambassador [[Amadou Hampâté Bâ]], himself a Tijani, in the biography of his own sheikh, [[Tierno Bokar]].

==Massignon to Nasr==
Thus the current into which the friends of the [[Traditionalist School]] had tapped proved to be a lively one. [[René Guénon]]'s wish to edit a series of Sufi translations was frustrated, but in the meantime [[Louis Massignon]] had prepared himself for the task. By 1922, his introduction to the technical lexicon of Sufism and the Passion of [[Al-Hallaj]] initiated the first line of textual study, translation and publication of sources that developed into the watershed of which the chief engineers were [[Henry Corbin]] and [[Seyyed Hossein Nasr]].

Since the observation is pertinent that thus far the watershed is fed from a distinct French sphere of influence, a mental exercise is needed to broaden the view. It is clear that [[Seyyed Hossein Nasr]]'s participation in the collaboration with [[Henry Corbin]] infused this field with a genuine consideration for some of the finer aspects ([[Irfan]]) of Islamic culture as seen from a proper native source – [[Iran]] – and adding a distinct contemporary sting to [[ecology]].

It may be interesting to compare two contributions to Sufi studies from this same angle – (1) Seyyed Hossein Nasr "Revelation, Intellect and Reason in the Qu'ran" in "Sufi Essays" – London and Albany, New York 1972. – (2) Reza Arasteh: "Psychology of the Sufi Way to Individuation" in "Sufi Studies East and West" Rushbrook Williams ed. New York 1973. Both describe the control over the "nafs", the spiritual "breaths" that color man's essential character; a study comparing intelligence in its western and eastern traditional form. Pr. Arasteh had already introduced this "Sufi Way" in his academical work on psychiatric theory ("Final Integration in Adult Personality" Brill Leiden 1965).

==Idries Shah==
Professor Reza Arasteh M. D. (remembered for his correspondence [http://www.merton.org/Research/index.asp] with [[Thomas Merton]]) wrote in honour of Sayyid [[Idries Shah]], whose stature as a scholar was as fiercely disputed as his communication to a general public was successful. Nevertheless, Sayyid [[Idries Shah]] caused the English feed of the watershed to be explored – through his own accessible style of writing, by providing affordable publications of great classical texts, and rebelliously askew on the niceties of an Oxford/Cambridge kind of rivalry over Pr. [[Reynold A. Nicholson|Nicholson]] and Pr. [[Arthur John Arberry|Arberry]] – and to exactly what extent can now easily be verified by the student willing to compare for himself the [[Eleven Naqshbandi principles|eleven Naqshbandi rules]] or exercise-aims listed by Sayyid [[Idries Shah]] in chapter VII of ''Oriental Magic'' in 1957 with those presently divulged through the proper channel [http://www.uga.edu/islam/11Naqsprin.html]. They are indeed the same.

"Oriental Magic" was read as a comparative study at the London [[Ethnological]] Institute. Sufi studies in general are directed as comparative studies of human understanding, and can be read as essays in psychosociology (see: [[Albert Hourani]] on "[[Marshall Hodgson]] and the Venture of Islam" in ''Islam in European Thought'' – Cambridge University Press 1991).

==Margaret Smith==

Special note could be taken of the little cited but brilliant academic [[Margaret Smith (author)|Margaret Smith]] who wrote (1925–1935) on the history of mysticism in the Near and Middle East from a woman's perspective leading to classic pages on early Christian mysticism, women in the early Christian Church, Christianity and Islam at the beginning of the Islamic era (see:[[Hanif]]), the rise of Sufism and the early ascetic ideal. Two exemplaries of her subject matter she studied in closer detail: [[Rabi'a al-'Adawiyya]] and [[Harith al-Muhasibi]].

The summary of her work reposes in her:
:''Studies in Early Mysticism in the Near and Middle East. Being an account of the rise and development of Christian mysticism up to the seventh century, of the subsequent development of mysticism in Islam, known as Sufism, and of the relationship between Christian and Islamic Mysticism with references, a bibliography and two indexes''
::Dedicated to the memory of [[Thomas Walker Arnold]]
::London, 1931 – The Sheldon Press; reprinted 1973 by Philo Press cv, Amsterdam

==Later academics==

By the end of the 20th century, the academic study of Sufism was well established in university departments of [[religious studies]].

The perspectives of these later scholars varied. Some were purely scientific, while some followed in the line of [[Louis Massignon|Massignon]], or (sometimes privately) in the line of [[Guénon]] and the [[Traditionalist School|Traditionalists]], modified somewhat for an academic environment.

For a contemporary academical "state of the art" see: "Sufism in the West", bibliography pp.&amp;nbsp;190–202 (Jamal Malik and John Hinnells ed. Routledge: London and New York, 2006).

'''''The Early Heidegger and Medieval Philosophy: Phenomenology for the Godforsaken''''' is a 2006 book by [[Sean J. McGrath]], in which the author critiques [[secularization]] through examining the relationship between [[Martin Heidegger]]'s thought and late medieval and early [[Protestant Christianity]].

==Synopsis==
Struck by the analogies between the thought of the early Heidegger and late medieval and early Protestant Christianity, McGrath discovered that the similarities were far from accidental. Through careful archival work in Germany, McGrath argued (with Max Scheler and Jacques Derrida), that Heidegger, an ex-seminarian and formerly devout Catholic, had secularized Christian concepts in ''[[Being and Time]]''. 
Heidegger’s book went on to become a foundational text in 20th century atheist thought, and yet none of its major themes would be possible, according to McGrath, without Christianity.

==Reception==
The book has been reviewed by [[Philipp Rosemann]], James D. Reid, [[Christian Lotz]] and Michael L.

'''''Thus Spoke Zarathustra: A Book for All and None''''' ({{lang-de|Also sprach Zarathustra: Ein Buch für Alle und Keinen}}, also translated as '''''Thus Spake Zarathustra''''') is a [[philosophical novel]] by German philosopher [[Friedrich Nietzsche]], composed in four parts between 1883 and 1885 and published between 1883 and 1891.&lt;ref&gt;The first two parts were published in 1883, the third one in 1884, and the last one in 1891.&lt;/ref&gt; Much of the work deals with ideas such as the "eternal recurrence of the same", the parable on the "[[God is dead|death of God]]", and the "prophecy" of the ''[[Übermensch]]'', which were first introduced in ''[[The Gay Science]]''.&lt;ref&gt;C. Guignon, D. Pereboom. ''Existentialism: Basic Writings, 2nd ed.'', Hackett, 2001. pp. 101–13&lt;/ref&gt;

==Origins==
[[File:Nietzsche-Stein 01.jpg|thumb|right|Nietzsche wrote in ''[[Ecce Homo (book)|Ecce Homo]]'' that the central idea of ''Zarathustra'' occurred to him by a "pyramidal block of stone" on the shores of [[Lake Silvaplana]].]]
''Thus Spoke Zarathustra'' was conceived while Nietzsche was writing ''[[The Gay Science]]''; he made a small note, reading "6,000 feet beyond man and time", as evidence of this.&lt;ref&gt;Gutmann, James. "The "Tremendous Moment" of Nietzsche's Vision". ''The Journal of Philosophy'', Vol. 51, No. 25. American Philosophical Association Eastern Division: Papers to be presented at the Fifty-First Annual Meeting, [[Goucher College]], December 28–30, 1954. pp. 837–42.&lt;/ref&gt; More specifically, this note related to the concept of the [[Eternal Return|eternal recurrence]], which is, by Nietzsche's admission, the central idea of ''Zarathustra''; this idea occurred to him by a "pyramidal block of stone" on the shores of [[Lake Silvaplana]] in the [[Engadin|Upper Engadine]], a high alpine region whose valley floor is at {{convert|6000|ft|m}}. Nietzsche planned to write the book in three parts over several years. He wrote that the ideas for ''Zarathustra'' first came to him while walking on two roads surrounding [[Rapallo]], according to [[Elisabeth Förster-Nietzsche]] in the introduction of [[Thomas Common]]'s early translation of the book.

Although Part Three was originally planned to be the end of the book, and ends with a strong [[climax (narrative)|climax]], Nietzsche subsequently decided to write an additional three parts; ultimately, however, he composed only the fourth part, which is viewed to constitute an ''[[intermezzo]]''.

Nietzsche commented in ''[[Ecce Homo (book)|Ecce Homo]]'' that for the completion of each part: "Ten days sufficed; in no case, neither for the first nor for the third and last, did I require more" (trans. Kaufmann). The first three parts were first published separately, and were subsequently published in a single volume in 1887. The fourth part remained private after Nietzsche wrote it in 1885; a scant forty copies were all that were printed, apart from seven others that were distributed to Nietzsche's close friends. In March 1892, the four parts were finally reprinted as a single volume. Since then, the version most commonly produced has included all four parts.

The original text contains a great deal of word-play. An example of this is the use of words beginning ''[[über]]'' ("over" or "above") and ''unter'' ("down" or "below"), often paired to emphasise the contrast, which is not always possible to bring out in translation, except by coinages. An example is ''Untergang'', literally "down-going" but used in German to mean "setting" (as of the sun) but also "sinking", "demise", "downfall" or "doom"; which Nietzsche pairs with its opposite ''Übergang'' (meaning "transition", literally "over-going"). Another example is ''Übermensch'' (overman or superman), discussed later in this article.

==Synopsis==
The book chronicles the fictitious travels and speeches of Zarathustra. Zarathustra's namesake was the founder of [[Zoroastrianism]], usually known in English as [[Zoroaster]] ({{lang-ae|Zaraϑuštra}}). Nietzsche is clearly portraying a "new" or "different" Zarathustra, one who [[Transvaluation of values|turns traditional morality on its head]]. He goes on to characterize "what the name of Zarathustra means in my mouth, the mouth of the first immoralist:"

{{Quotation|For what constitutes the tremendous historical uniqueness of that [[Persian people|Persian]] is just the opposite of this. Zarathustra was the first to consider the fight of good and evil the very wheel in the machinery of things: the transposition of morality into the [[metaphysics|metaphysical]] realm, as a force, cause, and end in itself, is ''his'' work. [...] Zarathustra created this most calamitous error, morality; consequently, he must also be the first to recognize it. [...] His doctrine, and his alone, posits truthfulness as the highest virtue; this means the opposite of the cowardice of the "idealist” who flees from reality [...]—Am I understood?—The self-overcoming of morality, out of truthfulness; the self-overcoming of the moralist, into his opposite—into me—that is what the name of Zarathustra means in my mouth.|Nietzsche, ''Ecce Homo'', "Why I Am a Destiny", §3, trans. Walter Kaufmann}}

''Zarathustra'' has a simple characterisation and plot,&lt;ref&gt;Pippin, Robert. "Nietzsche: Thus Spoke Zarathustra". ''Cambridge Texts in the History of Philosophy'', [[University of Chicago]], 2006. {{ISBN|0-521-60261-0}}. p. ix.&lt;/ref&gt; narrated sporadically throughout the text. It possesses a unique experimental style, one that is, for instance, evident in newly invented "[[dithyramb]]s" narrated or sung by Zarathustra. Likewise, the separate ''[[Dionysian-Dithyrambs]]'' was written in autumn 1888, and printed with the full volume in 1892, as the corollaries of Zarathustra's "abundance".

Some speculate that Nietzsche intended to write about final acts of creation and destruction brought about by Zarathustra. However, the book lacks a ''finale'' to match that description; its actual ending focuses more on Zarathustra recognizing that his legacy is beginning to perpetuate, and consequently choosing to leave the higher men to their own devices in carrying his legacy forth.

''Zarathustra'' also contains the famous dictum "[[God is dead]]", which had appeared earlier in ''[[The Gay Science]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Nietzsche, Friedrich Wilhelm. "How One Becomes What One Is: With a Prelude in German Rhymes and an Appendix of Songs". (Edition) [[Random House]], 1974. p. xii.&lt;/ref&gt; In his autobiographical work ''Ecce Homo'', [[Nietzsche]] states that the book's underlying concept is discussed within "the penultimate section of the fourth book" of 'The Gay Science' (''[[Ecce Homo (book)|Ecce Homo]]'', Kaufmann). It is the [[eternal return|eternal recurrence of the same events]].

This concept first occurred to Nietzsche while he was walking in [[Switzerland]] through the woods along the lake of [[Silvaplana]] (close to [[Surlej]]); he was inspired by the sight of a gigantic, towering, pyramidal rock. Before ''Zarathustra'', Nietzsche had mentioned the concept in the fourth book of ''[[The Gay Science]]'' (e.g., sect. 341); this was the first public proclamation of the notion by him. Apart from its salient presence in ''Zarathustra'', it is also echoed throughout Nietzsche's work. At any rate, it is by Zarathustra's transfiguration that he embraces eternity, that he at last ascertains "the supreme will to power".&lt;ref&gt;''[[The Will to Power (manuscript)|The Will to Power]]'', sect. 617; trans. Kaufmann&lt;/ref&gt; This inspiration finds its expression with [[Zarathustra's roundelay]], featured twice in the book, once near the story's close:
{{cquote|O man, take care!&lt;br&gt;What does the deep midnight declare?&lt;br&gt;"I was asleep—&lt;br&gt;From a deep dream I woke and swear:—&lt;br&gt;The world is deep,&lt;br&gt;Deeper than day had been aware.&lt;br&gt;Deep is its woe—&lt;br&gt;Joy—deeper yet than agony:&lt;br&gt;Woe implores: Go!&lt;br&gt;But all joy wants eternity—&lt;br&gt;Wants deep, wants deep eternity."}}

Another singular feature of ''Zarathustra'', first presented in the prologue, is the designation of human beings as a transition between apes and the "''[[Übermensch]]''" (in English, either the "overman" or "superman"; or, ''superhuman'' or ''overhuman''. English translators Thomas Common and R. J. Hollingdale use ''superman'', while Kaufmann uses ''overman'', and Parkes uses ''overhuman''. Martin has opted to leave the nearly universally understood term as ''Übermensch'' in his new translation). The ''Übermensch'' is one of the many interconnecting, interdependent themes of the story, and is represented through several different metaphors. Examples include: the lightning that is portended by the silence and raindrops of a travelling storm cloud; or the sun's rise and culmination at its midday zenith; or a man traversing a rope stationed above an abyss, moving away from his uncultivated animality and towards the ''Übermensch''.

The symbol of the ''Übermensch'' also alludes to Nietzsche's notions of "self-mastery", "self-cultivation", "self-direction", and "self-overcoming". Expounding these concepts, Zarathustra declares:

{{Quotation|
"''I teach you the overman''.  Man is something that shall be overcome.  What have you done to overcome him?"
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;"All beings so far have created something beyond themselves; and do you want to be the ebb of this great flood and even go back to the beasts rather than overcome man? What is the ape to man?  A laughingstock or a painful embarrassment. And man shall be just that for the overman: a laughingstock or a painful embarrassment. You have made your way from worm to man, and much in you is still worm.  Once you were apes, and even now, too, man is more ape than any ape."
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
"Whoever is the wisest among you is also a mere conflict and cross between plant and ghost.  But do I bid you become ghosts or plants?"
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;"Behold, I teach you the overman! The overman is the meaning of the earth.  Let your will say: the overman ''shall be'' the meaning of the earth! I beseech you, my brothers, ''remain faithful to the earth'', and do not believe those who speak to you of otherworldly hopes! Poison-mixers are they, whether they know it or not. Despisers of life are they, decaying and poisoned themselves, of whom the earth is weary: so let them go!"|''Thus Spoke Zarathustra'', Prologue, §3, trans. Walter Kaufmann}}

The book embodies a number of innovative poetical and rhetorical methods of expression. It serves as a parallel and supplement to the various philosophical ideas present in Nietzsche's body of work. He has, however, said that "among my writings my '''Zarathustra''' stands to my mind by itself" (''Ecce Homo'', Preface, sec. 4, Kaufmann). Emphasizing its centrality and its status as his ''[[Masterpiece|magnum opus]]'', Nietzsche stated that:

{{Quotation|With [''Thus Spoke Zarathustra''] I have given mankind the greatest present that has ever been made to it so far. This book, with a voice bridging centuries, is not only the highest book there is, the book that is truly characterized by the air of the heights—the whole fact of man lies ''beneath'' it at a tremendous distance—it is also the ''deepest'', born out of the innermost wealth of truth, an inexhaustible well to which no pail descends without coming up again filled with gold and goodness.|''Ecce Homo'', Preface, §4, trans. Walter Kaufmann}}

Since many of the book's ideas are also present in his other works, ''Zarathustra'' is seen to have served as a precursor to his later philosophical thought. With the book, Nietzsche embraced a distinct [[aesthetic]] assiduity. He later reformulated many of his ideas in ''[[Beyond Good and Evil]]'' and various other writings that he composed thereafter. He continued to emphasize his philosophical concerns; generally, his intention was to show an alternative to repressive moral codes and to avert "[[nihilism]]" in all of its varied forms.

Other aspects of ''Thus Spoke Zarathustra'' relate to Nietzsche's proposed "[[Transvaluation of values|Transvaluation of All Values]]". This incomplete project began with ''[[The Antichrist (book)|The Antichrist]]''.

==Themes==
While Nietzsche injects myriad ideas into the book, a few recurring themes stand out.  The overman (Übermensch), a self-mastered individual who has achieved his full power, is an almost omnipresent idea in ''Thus Spoke Zarathustra''.  Man as a race is merely a bridge between animals and the overman.  

The [[eternal recurrence]], found elsewhere in Nietzsche's writing, is also mentioned.  "Eternal recurrence" is the possibility that all events in one's life will happen again and again, infinitely.  The embrace of all of life's horrors and pleasures alike shows a deference and acceptance of fate, or ''Amor Fati''.  The love and acceptance of one's path in life is a defining characteristic of the overman.  Faced with the knowledge that he would repeat every action that he has taken, an overman would be elated as he has no regrets and loves life.  Opting to change any decision or event in one's life would indicate the presence of resentment or fear; contradistinctly the overman is characterized by courage and a Dionysian spirit.

The [[will to power]] is the fundamental component of the human identity.  Everything we do is an expression of the will to power.  The will to power is a psychological analysis of all human action and is accentuated by self-overcoming and self-enhancement.  Contrasted with living for procreation, pleasure, or happiness, the will to power is the summary of all man's struggle against his surrounding environment as well as his reason for living in it.

Many [[criticisms of Christianity]] can be found in ''Thus Spoke Zarathustra'', in particular Christian values of good and evil and its belief in an afterlife.  The basis for his critique of Christianity lies in the perceived squandering of our earthly lives in pursuit of a perfect afterlife, of which there is no evidence.  This empiricist view (denial of afterlife) is not fully examined in a rational argument in the text, but taken as a simple fact in Nietzsche's aphoristic writing style.  Judeo-Christian values are more thoroughly examined in ''On the Genealogy of Morals'' as a product of what he calls "slave morality".

==Style==
Noteworthy for its format, the book comprises a philosophical work of fiction whose style often lightheartedly imitates that of the [[New Testament]] and of the Platonic dialogues, at times resembling [[pre-Socratic]] works in tone and in its use of natural phenomena as rhetorical and explanatory devices. It also features frequent references to the Western literary and philosophical traditions, implicitly offering an interpretation of these traditions and of their problems. Nietzsche achieves all of this through the character of [[Zoroaster|Zarathustra]] (referring to the traditional prophet of [[Zoroastrianism]]), who makes speeches on philosophic topics as he moves along a loose plotline marking his development and the reception of his ideas. This characteristic (following the genre of the ''[[Bildungsroman]]'') can be seen as an inline commentary on Zarathustra's (and Nietzsche's) philosophy. All this, along with the book's ambiguity and paradoxical nature, has helped its eventual enthusiastic reception by the reading public, but has frustrated academic attempts at analysis (as Nietzsche may have intended). ''Thus Spoke Zarathustra'' remained unpopular as a topic for scholars (especially those in the Anglo-American [[analytic philosophy|analytic tradition]]) until the second half of the twentieth century brought widespread interest in Nietzsche and his unconventional style that does not distinguish between philosophy and literature.&lt;ref&gt;
Behler, Ernst, ''Nietzsche in the Twentieth Century'' in ''The Cambridge Companion to Nietzsche'', Magnus and Higgins (ed), Cambridge University Press, 1996, pp. 281–319&lt;/ref&gt; It offers formulations of eternal recurrence, and Nietzsche for the first time speaks of the ''Übermensch'': themes that would dominate his books from this point onwards.

The critic [[Harold Bloom]], writing in ''[[The Western Canon: The Books and School of the Ages|The Western Canon]]'' (1994), criticized ''Thus Spoke Zarathustra'', calling the book "a gorgeous disaster" and "unreadable".&lt;ref name="Webster"&gt;{{cite book |author=Bloom, Harold |title=The Western Canon: The Books and School of the Ages |publisher=Riverhead Books |location=New York |year=1994 |pages=196, 422 |isbn=1-57322-514-2 |oclc= |doi= |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other commentators have suggested that Nietzsche's style is intentionally [[Irony|ironic]] for much of the book. This irony relates to an internal conflict of Nietzsche's: he hated religious leaders but perceived himself as at least somewhat akin to one.&lt;ref name="Shapiro 1980"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Shapiro|first=Gary|title=The Rhetoric of Nietzsche's Zarathustra|journal=boundary 2|date=Winter 1980|volume=8|issue=2|publisher=Duke University Press|quote=Zarathustra does not want to be worshipped himself, and he will be remembered only by continual dance and play which by its very nature must avoid any centering of a privileged object or person. Even the notion of eternal recurrence is treated playfully in a number of ambiguous references to the confusion of times. That a play upon the tropes should end with irony makes the fact of play itself unavoidable but it does not leave much standing in the way of straightforward doctrines or teachings—just as the higher men must surrender their desperately gleaned fragments of doctrine for Zarathustra's dances.|jstor=302845}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Buch Also sprach Zarathustra.jpg|thumb|200px|The book ''Thus Spoke Zarathustra'' with pictures by [[Lena Hades]] in German and Russian]]

The first English translation of ''Zarathustra'' was published in 1896 by [[Alexander Tille]].

[[Thomas Common]] published a translation in 1909 which was based on Alexander Tille's earlier attempt.&lt;ref name=wk&gt;Nietzsche, Friedrich. Trans. Kaufmann, Walter. ''The Portable Nietzsche''. 1976, pp. 108–09.&lt;/ref&gt; Common wrote in the [[Early Modern English|style]] of [[Shakespeare]] or the [[King James Version]] of the [[Bible]].  Common's poetic interpretation of the text, which renders the title ''Thus Spake Zarathustra'', received wide acclaim for its lambent portrayal. Common reasoned that because the original German was written in a pseudo-[[Luther Bible|Luther-Biblical style]], a pseudo-King-James-Biblical style would be fitting in the English translation.

The Common translation remained widely accepted until more critical translations, titled ''Thus Spoke Zarathustra'', were published by [[Walter Kaufmann (philosopher)|Walter Kaufmann]] in 1954,&lt;ref name="portable"/&gt; and [[R.J. Hollingdale]] in 1961,{{citation needed|date=May 2015}} which are considered to convey more accurately the German text than the Common version. Kaufmann's introduction to his own translation included a blistering critique of Common's version; he notes that in one instance, Common has taken the German "most evil" and rendered it "baddest", a particularly unfortunate error not merely for his having coined the term "baddest", but also because Nietzsche dedicated a third of ''[[The Genealogy of Morals]]'' to the difference between "bad" and "evil".&lt;ref name=wk /&gt; This and other errors led Kaufmann to wonder whether Common "had little German and less English".&lt;ref name=wk /&gt; The translations of Kaufmann and Hollingdale render the text in a far more familiar, less archaic, style of language, than that of Common.

Thomas Wayne, an English Professor at Edison State College in Fort Myers, Florida, published a translation in 2003. The introduction by Roger W. Phillips, Ph.D., says "Wayne's close reading of the original text has exposed the deficiencies of earlier translations, preeminent among them that of the highly esteemed Walter Kaufmann", and gives several reasons.

Clancy Martin's 2005 translation opens with criticism and praise for these three seminal translators, Common, Kaufmann and Hollingdale. He notes that the German text available to Common was considerably flawed, and that the German text from which Hollingdale and Kaufmann worked was itself untrue to Nietzsche's own work in some ways. Martin criticizes Kaufmann for changing punctuation, altering literal and philosophical meanings, and dampening some of Nietzsche's more controversial metaphors.&lt;ref name=cm&gt;Nietzsche, Friedrich. Trans. Martin, Clancy. ''Thus Spoke Zarathustra''. 2005, p. xxxiii.&lt;/ref&gt; Kaufmann's version, which has become the most widely available, features a translator's note suggesting that Nietzsche's text would have benefited from an editor; Martin suggests that Kaufmann "took it upon himself to become his [Nietzsche's] editor".&lt;ref name=cm /&gt;

Graham Parkes describes his own 2005 translation as trying "above all to convey the musicality of the text".&lt;ref&gt;Friedrich Wilhelm Nietzsche, Graham Parkes. ''Thus spoke Zarathustra''. 2005, p. xxxv&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2006, Cambridge University Press published a translation by Adrian Del Caro, edited by Robert Pippin.

==Musical and literary adaptations==
The book inspired [[Richard Strauss]] to compose the [[symphonic poem|tone poem]] ''[[Also sprach Zarathustra (Strauss)|Also sprach Zarathustra]]'', which he designated "freely based on Friedrich Nietzsche".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.americansymphony.org/dialogues_extensions/99_2000season/2000_03_08/strauss.cfm|author=Bernard Jacobson|work=American Symphony Orchestra: Dialogues and Extensions|title=Richard Strauss, Also Sprach Zarathustra, Op. 30 (1896)|accessdate=2007-12-11|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071015100042/http://americansymphony.org/dialogues_extensions/99_2000season/2000_03_08/strauss.cfm|archivedate=2007-10-15|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''[[Zarathustra's Roundelay]]'' is set as part of [[Gustav Mahler]]'s [[Symphony No. 3 (Mahler)|Third Symphony]] (1895–6), originally under the title ''What Man Tells Me'', or alternatively ''What the Night Tells Me (Of Man)''.

[[Frederick Delius]] based his major choral-orchestral work ''[[A Mass of Life]]'' (1904–5) on texts from ''Thus Spoke Zarathustra''. The work ends with a setting of ''[[Zarathustra's roundelay]]'' which Delius had composed earlier, in 1898, as a separate work. Another setting of the roundelay is one of the songs of [[Lukas Foss]]'s ''Time Cycle'' for soprano and orchestra (1959–60).

[[Carl Orff]] also composed a three-movement setting of part of Nietzsche's text as a teenager, but this work remains unpublished.

The short score of the third symphony by [[Arnold Bax]] originally began with a quotation from Thus Spoke Zarathustra: ‘My wisdom became pregnant on lonely mountains; upon barren stones she brought forth her young’.

Latin American writer [[Giannina Braschi]] wrote the philosophical novel ''[[United States of Banana]]'' based on Walter Kaufman's translation of ''Thus Spoke Zarathustra''; in it, Zarathustra and [[Prince Hamlet|Hamlet]] philosophize about the liberty of modern man in a capitalist society.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.libraryjournal.com/lj/reviews/book/891872-421/fiction_reviews_october_1_2011.html.csp |title=Fiction Reviews, October 1, 2011 |publisher=Libraryjournal.com |date= |accessdate=2011-11-01 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111217020911/http://www.libraryjournal.com/lj/reviews/book/891872-421/fiction_reviews_october_1_2011.html.csp |archivedate=December 17, 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Italian progressive rock band [[Museo Rosenbach]] released in 1973 the album ''[[Zarathustra (album)|Zarathustra]]'', with lyrics referring to the book.

''Also Sprach Zarathustra'' is referenced in the [[Xenosaga]] video game series, even making it into the title of ''Xenosaga Episode III: Also Sprach Zarathustra''. The plot covers similar topics that Friedrich Nietzsche covers in his writings.

The english translation of part 2 chapter 7 "Tarantulas" have been narrated by Jordan Peterson and musically toned by artist Akira the Don.

'''Ulrich Schrade''' (21 July 1943 in Patricken / [[East Prussia]] (now [[Patryki]], [[Poland]]) – 15 November 2009 in [[Warsaw]], [[Poland]]) was a  [[philosopher]], [[educationist]] and [[ethicist]]. Born in East Prussia, he was part of the Germans, who managed to remain in their homeland, when it was conquered by the Soviet Union in 1945 and parts were given to Communist Poland.

==Life==
In the years 1961-1966 he studied economics under Boleslaw Kasprowicz at the [[Higher School of Economics in Sopot]], Poland); from 1966-1969 he worked at the creation of the tire plant in [[Olsztyn]]; in the years 1969-1974 he studied philosophy under Bogusław Wolniewicz at the [[University of Warsaw]]. 

Since 1974 he worked at the Faculty of Management and Social Sciences at the [[Warsaw University of Technology]]. At this university he is considered to be the founder of a specific current of philosophy of science and technology and a major contributor to the theory of higher education. Until his death he was holding the following positions: 

* Head of the Department of Philosophy
* Head of Pedagogical Seminary
* Head of the Postgraduate Pedagogical Studies at the [[Warsaw University of Technology]].

He was a member of the Disciplinary Commission of the Higher Education Council and board member of the [[Polish Philosophical Society]]. 

The core of his scientific interests were the general problems of anthropology and axiology and education theory. He was a professor at the [[Warsaw University of Technology]] and has also worked as a visiting professor at the [http://www.ah.edu.pl/palio/html.run?_Instance=wsh-postgres&amp;_PageID=1&amp;_LangID=2&amp;_CheckSum=-953627942 Akademia Humanistyczna in Pułtusk] (''Pultusk Academy of Humanities'').

The '''unity of science''' is a thesis in [[philosophy of science]] that says that all the sciences form a unified whole.

==Overview==
Even though, for example, [[physics]] and [[sociology]] are distinct disciplines, the thesis of the unity of science says that in principle they must be part of a unified intellectual endeavor: science. The unity of science thesis is usually associated with the view of levels of organization in nature, where physics is the most basic, [[chemistry]] the level above physics, [[biology]] above chemistry, sociology above biology, and so forth. Further, [[Cell (biology)|cells]], [[organism]]s, and [[culture]]s are all biological, but they represent three different levels of biological organization.

It has also been suggested (for example, in [[Jean Piaget]]'s 1918 work ''Recherche'') that the unity of science can be considered in terms of a circle of the sciences, where logic is the foundation for mathematics, which is the foundation for mechanics and physics, and physics is the foundation for chemistry, which is the foundation for biology, which is the foundation for sociology, the moral sciences, psychology, and the theory of knowledge, and the theory of knowledge is based on logic.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|website=www.fondationjeanpiaget.ch|title=Recherche|last=Piaget|first=Jean|authorlink=Jean Piaget|date=2006|origyear=1918|access-date=9 February 2017|url=http://www.fondationjeanpiaget.ch/fjp/site/textes/VE/JP_18_Recherche.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The thesis of a unity of science simply says that common scientific laws apply everywhere and on all levels of organization.  On some levels of organization, the scientists there will call these laws by another name, or emphasize the importance of one over another.  For example, thermodynamics or the laws of energy seem to be universal across a number of disciplines.  That is almost certainly because nearly all systems in nature operate using transactions in energy.  However, this does not rule out the possibility of some laws being particular to specific domains of inquiry—perhaps characterized by increasing complexity of those domains, as suggested by Henriques' (2003) [[tree of knowledge system]] that proposes four degrees of complexity (Matter, Life, Mind, and Culture). Of course, his tree might equally be a circle, with culture necessarily framing people's understanding of matter.

Science is a human endeavor, a part of human culture.  It is unified in the sense that it is understood as a single endeavor, and there are no scientists studying alternative realities. To the extent that they do, however, one could argue that they are not unified. It is the perception of a single reality that results in a unity of science.

Separately, science is also apparently on a path toward simplification or actually a "universalization" of discrete scientific theories about energy that physicists call unification. This has led to several theory among which [[string theory]], and is probably related to the notion that, at bottom, there is only the energy that was released in the big bang, and really nothing else. 
 
The unity of science thesis is most famously clarified and tentatively argued for by [[Ludwig von Bertalanffy]]'s [[General System Theory]], Sir Jagdish Chandra Bos ,[[Paul Oppenheim]] and [[Hilary Putnam]]. It is most famously argued against by [[Jerry Fodor]], [[John Dupre]] and [[Paul Feyerabend]].

'''Yongjia School of Thought''' ([[Chinese character|Chinese]]: 永嘉学派; [[Pinyin]]: Yǒngjiā Xuépài) was a Chinese [[school of thought]] during the [[Song dynasty]] that advocated for [[privatization]], [[market economy]], [[pragmatism]], [[free trade]], [[tax cut]], and challenged [[Confucianism]]. It was named after Yongjia, now called [[Wenzhou]] and composed mainly of scholars from [[Wenzhou]] (then Yongjia).

"Yongjia School of Thought" is considered to be the leading force that gave rise to the economic prosperity of [[Song Dynasty]] in China and has close ties to the prosperity of [[market economy]] and [[private economy]] in [[Song Dynasty]].&lt;ref&gt;https://books.google.com/books?id=tRzDCwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT131&amp;lpg=PT131&amp;dq=永嘉学派&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=Aw35Z4-RH0&amp;sig=LScDhp9uwCx5K1S_M0sOkuBLZ0M&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjQ7d6RsJnXAhUI6YMKHQn4AUgQ6AEIYzAG#v=onepage&amp;q=永嘉学派&amp;f=false&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://books.google.com/books?id=pWbBBwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT96&amp;lpg=PT96&amp;dq=永嘉学派&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=ToYGWEtfVW&amp;sig=sC2u1d9h2G1oKcrXJpeiU1cmo_M&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjQ7d6RsJnXAhUI6YMKHQn4AUgQ6AEIbzAI#v=onepage&amp;q=永嘉学派&amp;f=false&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://news.66wz.com/system/2010/09/02/102055072.shtml&lt;/ref&gt;

It is considered to be an extremely unique school of thought in Chinese history as it advocated for the importance of [[commerce]], [[privatization]], [[market economy]], [[free trade]], [[currency market]] while China by tradition values [[agriculture]], concepts, and thoughts that were distinctly different.&lt;ref&gt;http://news.66wz.com/system/2010/09/02/102055072.shtml&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://zj.zjol.com.cn/news/655083.html&lt;/ref&gt;

It was one of the three dominant schools of thought in [[Song Dynasty]] along with "Li School of Thought" led by [[Zhu Xi]] and "Universal Mind School of Thought" led by [[Lu Jiuyuan]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.cssn.cn/zhx/zx_zxlp/201505/t20150519_1952034.shtml&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt;http://gxzk.guoxue.com/Html/2014-03-06/1116.html&lt;/ref&gt;

{{nihongo|'''Zuiryū-ji'''|瑞龍寺}}) is a [[Buddhist temples in Japan|Buddhist temple]] in  [[Takaoka, Toyama|Takaoka]], [[Toyama Prefecture]], [[Japan]]. The temple belongs to the [[Sōtō]]-school of Japanese [[Zen]] [[Japanese Buddhism|Buddhism]].

== History ==
The second ''[[daimyō]]'' of [[Kaga Domain]], [[Maeda Toshinaga]] (1562–1614) after retiring to Takaoka, had a temple, {{nihongo|Hōen-ji|法円寺}} built, which was completed in 1613. After Toshinaga's death in 1614, the temple was renamed to Zuiryū-ji after his posthumous name, {{nihongo|Zuiryū-in|瑞龍院}}. His younger brother, [[Maeda Toshitsune]], and third ''daimyō'' of Kaga, in commemoration of Toshinaga, had the temple expanded starting in 1645. The extensions were supervised by {{nihongo|Yamagami Zen’emon Yoshihiro|山上善右衛門嘉広}} who completed the works for the 50th anniversary in 1663. The temple complex at the time covered an area of {{convert|118800|m2|abbr=on}} and — similar to a castle — was surrounded by two moats.
