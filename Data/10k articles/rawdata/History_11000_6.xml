'''''A Short History of Progress''''' is a non-fiction book and lecture series by [[Ronald Wright]] about [[societal collapse]]. The lectures were delivered as a series of five speeches, each taking place in different cities across Canada as part of the 2004 [[Massey Lectures]] which were broadcast on the [[CBC Radio]] program, ''[[Ideas (radio show)|Ideas]]''. The book version was published by [[House of Anansi Press]] and released at the same time as the lectures. The book spent more than a year on Canadian best-seller lists, won the Canadian Book Association's Libris Award for Non-Fiction Book of the Year, and was nominated for the [[British Columbia's National Award for Canadian Non-Fiction]]. It has since been reprinted in a hardcover format with illustrations.

Wright, an author of fiction and non-fiction works, uses the fallen civilisations of [[Easter Island]], [[Sumer]], [[Roman Empire|Rome]], and [[Maya civilisation|Maya]], as well as examples from the Stone Age, to see what conditions led to the downfall of those societies. He examines the meaning of [[progress (history)|progress]] and its implications for civilizations—past and present—arguing that the twentieth century was a time of runaway growth in [[World population|human population]], [[Conspicuous consumption|consumption]], and technology that has now placed an [[Sustainability|unsustainable]] burden on all [[biosphere|natural systems]].

In his analysis of the four cases of fallen civilizations, he notes that two (Easter Island and Sumer) failed due to depletion of [[natural resources]]—"their [[Ecology|ecologies]] were unable to regenerate."  The other two failed in their heartlands, "where ecological demand was highest," but left remnant populations that survived. He asks the question: "Why, if civilizations so often destroy themselves, has the overall experiment of civilization done so well."  For the answer, he says, we must look to natural regeneration and [[human migration]] (Wright, 102).  While some [[ancient civilizations]] were depleting their ecologies and failing, others were rising. Large expanses of the planet were unsettled. The other factor, evident in both [[Egypt]] and [[China]], was that due to abundant resources (e.g., topsoil), [[Agriculture|farming]] methods (ones that worked with, rather than against, natural cycles), and settlement patterns, these civilizations had greater longevity (103-104).

Changes brought on by the exponential growth of human [[Population growth|population]] (at the time of the book's publication, over 6 billion and adding more than 200 million people every three years) and the worldwide scale of [[resource consumption]], have altered the picture, however.  Ecological markers indicate that human civilization has now surpassed (since the 1980s) nature's capacity for regeneration.  We are now using more than 125% of nature's yearly output.  "If civilization is to survive, it must live on the [[interest]], not the [[Capital (economics)|capital]] of nature" (129).  He concludes that "now is our chance to get the future right"—the collapse of human civilization is imminent if we do not act now to prevent it (132).

==Background==
Prior to being selected to deliver the Massey Lectures, Wright had written award-winning fiction and non-fiction books that deal with anthropology and civilizations. His 1992 non-fiction book ''Stolen Continents: The "New World" Through Indian Eyes'' was awarded the 1993 Gordon Montador Award from the [[Writers' Trust of Canada]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Stolen Continents wins inaugural award (Gordon Montador Award)|journal= The Canadian Bookseller |date=June–July 1993 |volume= 15 |issue=6 |page= 106}}&lt;/ref&gt; and his 1998 novel ''A Scientific Romance'', about a museum curator who travels into the future and investigates the fate of the human race, won the [[David Higham Prize for Fiction]] for [[Debut novel|first-time novelists]]. Wright traces the origins of the ideas behind ''A Short History of Progress'' to the material he studied while writing ''A Scientific Romance'' and his 2000 essay for ''[[The Globe and Mail]]'' titled "Civilization is a Pyramid Scheme" about the fall of the ninth-century Mayan civilisation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Sandra |last= Martin |title=Our last chance to get the future right |work=Globe and Mail |location=Canada  |date= 6 November 2004 |page=F.6 |url= https://www.theglobeandmail.com/life/our-last-chance-to-get-the-future-right/article956497/page1/ |accessdate=17 November 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Synopsis==
The first chapter, "Gauguin's Questions", poses the questions that provide a framework for the book. Referring to [[Paul Gauguin]]'s painting of the [[Where Do We Come From? What Are We? Where Are We Going?|same name]] the questions are: ''Where do we come from? What are we? Where are we going?'' Wright defines progress using the Victorian terms "the assumption that a pattern of change exists in the history of mankind...that it consists of irreversible changes in one direction only, and that this direction is towards improvement". Despite the extended time span of the [[Stone Age]], Wright places the first sign of progress as being the ability to create fire. The competition between [[Cro-Magnon]] and [[Neanderthal]]s is examined with respect to the conditions that allowed one to out-compete the other.

{{quote box |width=25em | bgcolor=#c6dbf7 |align=left |halig=left | salign=right |quote= Many of the great ruins that grace the deserts and jungles of the earth are monuments to progress traps, the headstones of civilizations which fell victim to their own success. In the fates of such societies – once mighty, complex, and brilliant – lie the most instructive lessons...they are fallen airliners whose black boxes can tell us what went wrong. |source=&amp;nbsp;—''A Short History of Progress'', p 8}}

The second chapter, "The Great Experiment", continues the examination of Stone Age progress by looking at the advancements in hunting. Wright uses the term "[[progress trap]]" to refer to innovations that create new problems for which the society is unable or unwilling to solve, or inadvertently create conditions that are worse than what existed before the innovation. For example, innovations in hunting during the Stone Age allowed for more successful hunts and consequently more free time during which culture and art were created (e.g. cave paintings, bone carvings, etc.), but also led to extinctions, most notably of [[megafauna]]. As smaller and smaller game were hunted to replace larger extinct animals, the hunts became less successful and culture declined. [[History of agriculture|Agriculture]], and subsequently civilisations, independently arising in multiple regions at about the same time, ~10,000 years ago, indicates to Wright that "given certain broad conditions, human societies everywhere will move towards greater size, complexity and environmental demand". The chapter title refers to the human experience which Wright sees as a large experiment testing what conditions are required for a human civilisation to succeed.

In the third chapter, "Fools' Paradise", the rise and fall of two civilisations are examined: [[Easter Island]] and [[Sumer]]. Both flourished, but collapsed as a result of [[resource depletion]]; both were able to visually see their land being eroded but were unwilling to reform. On Easter Island logging, in order to erect statues and build boats, destroyed their ecosystem and led to wars over the last planks of wood on the island. In Sumer, a large irrigation system, as well as over-grazing, land clearing, and [[Lime kiln|lime-burning]] led to [[desertification]] and [[Soil salinity|soil salination]].

{{quote box |width=25em | bgcolor=#c6dbf7 |align=right |halig=left | salign=right|quote= The lesson I read in the past is this: that the health of land and water – and of woods, which are the keepers of water – can be the only lasting basis for any civilization’s survival and success. |source=&amp;nbsp;—''A Short History of Progress'', p 105}}

In the fourth chapter, "Pyramid Schemes", the fates of the [[Roman Empire|Roman]] and [[Maya civilisation|Mayan]] civilisations are compared; both peaked with centralised empires but ended with power being diffused to their periphery as the center collapsed and ultra-conservative leadership refused reformations. Anthropologist [[Joseph Tainter]]'s explanation for the fall of the Roman Empire is invoked, that "complex systems inevitably succumb to diminishing returns" so that the costs of operating an empire are so high that alternatives are implemented. Two examples of civilisations that have been sustainable are described: China and Egypt. Both had an abundance of resources, particularly [[topsoil]], and used farming methods that worked with, rather than against, natural cycles, and settlement patterns that did not exceed, or permanently damage, the [[carrying capacity]] of the local environment.

The final chapter, "The Rebellion of the Tools", seeks to answer the final Gauguin question, 'where are we going?', by applying these past examples to modern society. Wright sees needed reforms being blocked by vested interests who reject [[Multilateralism|multi-lateral organisations]], and support [[Laissez-faire|laissez-faire economics]] and transfers of power to corporations as leading to the social and environmental degradations that led to the collapse of previous civilisations. Necessary reforms are, in Wright's view, being blocked by vested interests who are hostile to change, including American market extremists. Wright concludes that "our present behaviour is typical of failed societies at the zenith of their greed and arrogance" and calls for a shift towards long-term thinking:

The great advantage we have, our best chance for avoiding the fate of past societies, is that we know about those past societies. We can see how and why they went wrong. ''Homo sapiens'' has the information to know itself for what it is: an Ice Age hunter only half-evolved towards intelligence; clever but seldom wise.

We are now at the stage when the Easter Islanders could still have halted the senseless cutting and carving, could have gathered the last trees' seeds to plant out of reach of the rats. We have the tools and the means to share resources, clean up pollution, dispense basic health care and birth control, set economic limits in line with natural ones. If we don't do these things now, while we prosper, we will never be able to do them when times get hard. Our fate will twist out of our hands.

==Style==
The contents of the book were originally written and delivered as a set of five speeches for the 2004 [[Massey Lectures]]; each speech is presented in the book as one chapter. The writing reflects Wright oration style with the use of high rhetoric.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first= Marq |last= de Villiers |title= Voices for change |journal = [[Canadian Geographic]] |volume =125 |issue =3 |pages =127–130 |date= May–June 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Patrick Parrinder]] notes that Wright sometimes uses "the rhetorical armoury of a rationalistic lay preacher."&lt;ref name=Parrinder&gt;{{cite journal |first= Patrick |last= Parrinder |title= Book Reviews |journal = [[Utopian Studies]] |volume =17 |issue =1 |pages =267–270 |year= 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; Wright takes a broad, philosophical approach, not focusing on individual people or specific politics or religions, but rather focusing on civilisations including 'the elites and the masses'.&lt;ref name=Parrinder/&gt; Wright's tone was described as "rarely depressing...[and that] he remains surprisingly upbeat and even entertaining."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first= Christine |last= Sismondo |title=If you read one book on impending doom this year, make it this one |work=The Ottawa Citizen |location= Ottawa, Ontario |date=21 November 2004 |page=C11}}
&lt;/ref&gt; The use of the word ''progress'' is intended to be ironic: what is viewed as technological or social advancement have, in the historical narratives he provides, led to the fall of civilizations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title= A Short History of Progress |journal = [[Kirkus Reviews]] |volume =73 |issue =4 |page =224 |date= 15 February 2005 |url= http://www.kirkusreviews.com/book-reviews/non-fiction/ronald-wright/a-short-history-of-progress/ |accessdate=17 November 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Wright coins the term "[[progress trap]]" to describe the phenomenon of turning "cleverness into recklessness."&lt;ref name=Bronwyn&gt;{{cite journal |first= Bronwyn |last= Drainie |title= As we go up, we go down |journal = [[Quill &amp; Quire]] |url= http://www.quillandquire.com/reviews/review.cfm?review_id=4249 |volume =70 |issue =12 |page =23 |date=December 2004 |accessdate=17 November 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Comparisons have been made between this book and [[Jared Diamond]]'s ''[[Collapse: How Societies Choose to Fail or Succeed]]'' which both cover similar subject matter with "a cautious problem-solving approach"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first= Claudia |last= Stoicescu |title= The Doomsayers |journal = [[Corporate Knights]] |volume =70 |issue =12 |pages =43–45 |date=May 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; and come to similar conclusions. Writing in ''[[A\J: Alternatives Journal|Alternatives Journal]]'', philosophy professor Kent Peacock notes that "both are well-written" but that Diamond includes examples of societies which had achieved [[sustainability]] for centuries, whereas Wright has "a stronger grasp of the dark side of human nature", like impatience, aggressiveness, and obstinacy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first= Kent |last= Peacock |title= Progress Traps |journal = [[A\J: Alternatives Journal|Alternatives Journal]] |volume =32 |issue =3 |pages =38–41 |date=July 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; Author and journalist [[Brian Brett]] described Collapse as "a slow, rich feast" while "the compact ''A Short History of Progress'' is an arrow loosed from a powerful bow, a lyric dart into the heart of human behaviour."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first= Brian |last= Brett |title=Why civilizations implode |work=Vancouver Sun |location=Canada  |date= 1 January 2005 |page=E.15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Publication and reception==
The book, published by [[House of Anansi Press]], was released at the same time the Massey Lectures were being delivered. In early November 2004, one lecture was given by Wright in each of the following cities: [[Ottawa]], Edmonton, [[Saskatoon]], [[Halifax Regional Municipality|Halifax]] and Toronto.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first= Jenni |last= Mortin |title=Get it right this time |work= [[The StarPhoenix]] |location= Saskatoon, Saskatchewan |date=6 November 2004 |page=E8}}&lt;/ref&gt; Their recording was broadcast on [[CBC Radio One|CBC Radio's]] ''[[Ideas (radio show)|Ideas]]'' during the week of November 22. The book was named the Canadian Booksellers Association's 2005 Non-Fiction Book of the Year at their annual Libris Awards&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release |publisher = Canadian Booksellers Association |date = 26 June 2005 |format = pdf |title =CBA Libris Awards 2005 |url= http://www.cbabook.org/files/Libris-2005-Winners.pdf |accessdate =12 November 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; and short-listed for the first annual British Columbia Award for Canadian Non-Fiction.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=One of these outstanding books will be the first |work= British Columbia Award for Canadian Non-Fiction |publisher= British Columbia Achievement Foundation |year= 2005 |url= http://www.bcachievement.com/nonfiction/media.php?year=2005 |accessdate =14 November 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; A hardcover edition title ''An Illustrated Short History of Progress'' was released with a print run of 15,000 copies in 2006.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=An Illustrated Short History of Progress |work= AIGA Design Archives |publisher= American Institute of Graphic Arts |year= 2007 |url= http://designarchives.aiga.org/#/entries/%2Byear%3A%222006%22/_/detail/relevance/asc/197/7/7700/an-illustrated-short-history-of-progress/1 |accessdate =14 November 2010| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20101203044320/http://designarchives.aiga.org/| archivedate= 3 December 2010 | deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In ''[[The Globe and Mail]]'', Canadian author [[Paul William Roberts]] praised the book, calling it "... the most important use of printed word and post-consumer recycled fibres I have seen since Jérôme Deshusses's Délivrez Prométhée, 25 years ago." Roberts explains, "[Wright] has such a firm grasp of his goal that scarcely a word is extraneous... You feel you've read volumes, though, not just because of the density of Wright's thoughts, but due to the crushing weight of the burden they carry. In prose that is balefully evocative and irreducibly precise..."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first= Paul |last= Roberts |authorlink= Paul William Roberts |title=Do the Wright thing |work=Globe and Mail |location=Canada  |date= 6 November 2004 |page=D.6 |url= https://www.theglobeandmail.com/archives/do-the-wright-thing/article955077/singlepage/ |accessdate=17 November 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; On the other hand, in the ''[[National Post]]'' review, Peter Foster gave a negative review, chiding Wright for "not having the slightest clue about how economies work, or how, by their fundamental nature, markets are both moral and sustainable." Foster ended his review by insulting Wright's intellect, "What really needs some psychological excavation is Ronald Wright's mind, which carries a set of inflated, emotionally based moralistic assumptions derived from the structure of his primitive ignorance about markets and economics."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first= Peter |last= Foster |title=CBC Radio's Marxist Masseys |work=National Post |location=Canada  |date= 1 December 2004 |page=FP17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other reviews were encouraging. In ''[[Maclean's]]'' magazine Brian Bethune wrote it was "an elegant and learned discussion" on the topic.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first= Brian |last= Bethune |title= Mad, Mad World |journal = [[Maclean's]] |volume =117 |issue =47 |pages =44–46 |date= 22 November 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt; The review in ''[[The Times]]'' said it was "an eminently readable account...written with an incredible lightness of touch that belies the very serious issues."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Cradle of civilisation |work=The Times |location= London |date= 10 June 2006 |page=4}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the ''[[The Gazette (Montreal)|Montreal Gazette]]'', Bryan Demchinsky called Wright eloquent and the book "a brief, trenchant essay."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first= Bryan |last= Demchinsky |title=Monuments to neglect |work= [[The Gazette (Montreal)|The Gazette]] |location= Montreal, Quebec |date= 15 January 2005 |page=I.6}}
&lt;/ref&gt; Diane Barlee in [[Skeptic (U.S. magazine)|''Skeptic'']] magazine, said Wright is a "remarkably gifted wordsmith whose talent makes turgid facts not only digestible, but also generates a hunger for more" and commented "''A Short History of Progress'' is an important, well-crafted book, however, I can't promise that it will change your life."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first= Diane |last= Barlee |title= The Progress Trap |journal = [[Skeptic (U.S. magazine)|Skeptic]] |volume =12 |issue =1 |pages =86–87 |year= 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Film==
{{main article|Surviving Progress}}
The film rights were sold to [[Cinémaginaire]] in 2008.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first= Marke |last= Andrews |title=Vancouver film production on the money |work=Vancouver Sun |location=Canada  |date= 10 April 2008 |page=C.3}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was filmed as a documentary, ''Surviving Progress'' directed by Mathieu Roy and co-directed by Harold Crooks with [[Daniel Louis]] and [[Denise Robert]] as producers for Cinemaginaire and Gerry Flahive as producer for NFB. [[Martin Scorsese]] was attached to the project as executive producer as were Mark Achbar and Betsy Carson (Big Picture Media Corporation) and Silva Basmajian (NFB).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first= Douglas |last= Todd |title=We're evolving, but are we progressing? |work=Vancouver Sun |location=Canada  |date= 22 May 2010 |page=C.4}}&lt;/ref&gt; The film premiered at the 2011 [[Toronto International Film Festival]]. It was also shown as part of Festival Atmospheres on 31 March 2012 in Paris France.

While the book focused on ancient civilizations, the majority of the film addresses environmental impacts of our current 'global civilization', including the impact of concentrating wealth in the hands of the 'financial class'. It is filmed as a mixture of interviews with individuals, from Wright himself to Jane Goodall and Margaret Atwood, interspersed with striking footage from all over the world. Mathieu Roy and Harold Crooks gave an interview in early 2012 on the challenges of adapting Ronald Wright's book into a succinct film.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite podcast|format=[http://media.blubrry.com/extraenvironmentalist/p/extraenvironmentalist.com/audio/Ep41_final.mp3 MP3]|title=Episode 41 Surviving Progress |url=http://www.extraenvironmentalist.com/2012/05/27/episode-41-surviving-progress/ |host=The Extraenvironmentalist |date=7 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Abu Za`bal''' ({{Lang-ar|أبو زعبل}} / [[ALA-LC]]: ''{{transl|ar|ALA|Abū Zaʻbal&amp;#x202f;}}'', {{IPA-arz|æbuˈzæʕbæl}}) is a settlement in [[Egypt]].

The first Egyptian medical school was founded there, in 1827. In modern Egypt, it is an industrial suburb of [[Cairo]], with an extensive [[military–industrial complex]] and well-developed chemical industries.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1820">'''Action''' as a term in Western [[theatre]] practice refers to a principle from [[actor]] training first developed by Russian actor and theatre director [[Konstantin Stanislavski]] in the first half of the 20th century at the [[Moscow Art Theatre]]. It forms part of his overall structure of systematized acting training, most frequently called the System, which in its turn gave rise to [[Method Acting]].

In his writings on theatre, Stanislavski states "The basis of theatre is doing, dynamism. [...] In Latin, the corresponding word is actio, and the root of this same word has passed into our vocabulary, "''action''", "''actor''", "''act''". So, drama is an action we can see being performed, and, when he comes on, the actor becomes an agent in that action"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Stanislavski|first=Konstantin (transl. Jean Benedetti)|title=An Actor's Work: A Student's Diary|year=2008|publisher=Routlege|location=Abingdon|pages=40}}&lt;/ref&gt;  and "acting is action - mental and physical."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Stanislavski|first=Konstantin (transl. Jean Benedetti)|title=An Actor's Work: A Student's Diary|year=2008|publisher=Routlege|location=Abingdon|pages=40}}&lt;/ref&gt; Jean Benedetti understands action in a Stanislavskian context more simply as "What is done in order to fulfill a Task," a Task in its turn referring to "What a character has to do, the problem he has to solve."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Benedetti|first=Jean|title=Stanislavski and the Actor: The Final Acting Lessons|year=2008|publisher=Methuen|location=London|pages=152–153}}&lt;/ref&gt; Action as a term in theatre practice derived from the Stanislavski System therefore refers to that which a [[character (arts)|character]] undertakes in order to achieve a goal.

{{Humanism}}
In [[social theory]] and [[philosophy]], '''antihumanism''' (or '''anti-humanism''') is a theory that is critical of traditional humanism and traditional ideas about humanity and the [[human condition]].&lt;ref&gt;J. Childers/G. Hentzi eds., ''The Columbia Dictionary of Modern Literary and Cultural Criticism'' (1995) p. 140-1&lt;/ref&gt;  Central to antihumanism is the view that concepts of "[[human nature]]", "man", or "humanity" should be rejected as  historically relative or [[Metaphysics|metaphysical]].&lt;ref&gt;Childers, p. 100&lt;/ref&gt;

==Origins==
In the late 18th and 19th centuries, the philosophy of [[humanism]] was a cornerstone of [[the Enlightenment]]. From the belief in a universal moral core of humanity, it followed that all persons are inherently free and equal. For [[liberal humanism|liberal humanists]] such as [[Immanuel Kant|Kant]], the universal law of [[reason]] was a guide towards total emancipation from any kind of tyranny.&lt;ref&gt;Childers, p. 95-6&lt;/ref&gt;

Criticism of humanism as being over-idealistic  began in the 19th Century. For [[Friedrich Nietzsche]], humanism was nothing more than an empty figure of speech&lt;ref&gt;Tony Davies, ''Humanism'' (1997) p. 37&lt;/ref&gt; – a secular version of [[theism]]. [[Max Stirner]] expressed a similar position in his book ''[[The Ego and Its Own]]'', published several decades before Nietzsche's work.  Nietzsche argues in [[On the Genealogy of Morality|''Genealogy of Morals'']] that [[human rights]] exist as a means for the weak to constrain the strong; as such, they do not facilitate the emancipation of life, but instead deny it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=[[On the Genealogy of Morality]] |chapter=Chapter III &amp;sect;14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[young Marx|young Karl Marx]] is sometimes considered a humanist,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.marxists.org/subject/humanism/index.htm Marxist Humanism]&lt;/ref&gt; as opposed to the mature Marx who became more forceful in his criticism of human rights as [[idealist]] or [[utopian]]. Marx believed human rights were a product of the very [[dehumanization]] they were intended to oppose. Given that [[capitalism]] forces individuals to behave in a egoistic manner, they are in constant conflict with one another, and are thus in need of rights to protect themselves. True emancipation, he asserted, could only come through the establishment of [[communism]], which abolishes the private ownership of all means of production.&lt;ref&gt;Karl Marx ''On the Jewish Question'' (1843)&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 20th century, the view of humans as rationally autonomous was challenged by [[Sigmund Freud]], who believed humans to be largely driven by unconscious irrational desires.&lt;ref&gt;Peter Gay, ''Freud'' (1989) p. 449&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Martin Heidegger]] viewed humanism as a metaphysical philosophy that ascribes to humanity a universal [[essence]] and privileges it above all other forms of existence. For Heidegger, humanism takes [[consciousness]] as the paradigm of philosophy, leading it to a [[subjectivism]] and [[idealism]] that must be avoided. Like [[Hegel]] before him, Heidegger rejected the Kantian notion of [[autonomy]], pointing out that humans were social and historical beings, as well as Kant's notion of a constituting consciousness.{{Elucidate|date=July 2015}} Heidegger nevertheless retains links both to humanism and to [[existentialism]] despite his efforts to distance himself from both in the [[Letter on Humanism]] (1947).&lt;ref&gt;[http://home.southernct.edu/~gillilandr1/jobs/WhatBecomesoftheHumanafterHumanism5.htm What becomes of the Human after Humanism?] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121102225447/http://home.southernct.edu/~gillilandr1/jobs/WhatBecomesoftheHumanafterHumanism5.htm |date=November 2, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Positivism and "scientism"==
[[Positivism]] is a [[philosophy of science]] based on the view that in the [[social science|social]] as well as [[natural science]]s, information derived from [[sensory experience]], and logical and mathematical treatments of such data, are together the exclusive source of all authoritative knowledge.&lt;ref name="MacionisGerber7ed"/&gt; Positivism assumes that there is valid knowledge (truth) only in scientific knowledge.&lt;ref name="Larrain1979p197"&gt;[[Jorge Larrain]] (1979) ''The Concept of Ideology'' [https://books.google.com/books?id=9ocOAAAAQAAJ&amp;pg=PA197 p.197], quotation: {{quotation|one of the features of positivism is precisely its postulate that scientific knowledge is the paradigm of valid knowledge, a postulate that indeed is never proved nor intended to be proved.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Obtaining and ''verifying'' data that can be received from the senses is known as [[empirical evidence]].&lt;ref name="MacionisGerber7ed"&gt;John J. Macionis, Linda M. Gerber, "Sociology", Seventh Canadian Edition, Pearson Canada&lt;/ref&gt; This view holds that society operates according to general laws like the physical world. Introspective and intuitional attempts to gain knowledge are rejected. Though the positivist approach has been a recurrent theme in the history of Western thought,&lt;ref name="Cohen, Manion et al." &gt;{{Cite journal |last=Cohen |first=Louis |year=2007 |title=Research Methods In Education |pages=9 |publisher=[[Routledge]] |doi=10.1111/j.1467-8527.2007.00388_4.x |journal=British Journal of Educational Studies |volume=55 |last2=Maldonado |first2=Antonio |postscript=&lt;!--None--&gt; |issue=4}}.&lt;/ref&gt; the concept was developed in the modern sense in the early 19th century by the philosopher and founding sociologist, [[Auguste Comte]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |url=http://www.sociologyguide.com/thinkers/Auguste-Comte.php |title=Auguste Comte | encyclopedia = Sociology Guide |author=Sociology Guide}}&lt;/ref&gt; Comte argued that society operates according to its own quasi-absolute laws, much as the physical world operates according to gravity and other absolute laws of nature.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Sociology 14th Edition |last=Macionis |first=John J. |year=2012 |publisher=Pearson |location=Boston |isbn=978-0-205-11671-3 |page=11 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Humanist thinker [[Tzvetan Todorov]] has identified within modernity a trend of thought which emphasizes science and within it  tends towards a [[deterministic]] view of the world. He clearly identifies positivist theorist Auguste Comte as an important proponent of this view.&lt;ref&gt;Tzvetan Todorov. ''The Imperfect Garden''. Princeton University Press. 2001. Pg. 20&lt;/ref&gt; For Todorov "[[Scientism]] does not eliminate the will but decides that since the results of science are valid for everyone, this will must be something shared, not individual. In practice, the individual must submit to the collectivity, which "knows" better than he does." The autonomy of the will is maintained, but it is the will of the group, not the person...scientism has flourished in two very different political contexts...The first variant of scientism was put into practice by [[totalitarian]] regimes."&lt;ref&gt;Tzvetan Todorov. ''The Imperfect Garden''. Princeton University Press. 2001. Pg. 23&lt;/ref&gt; A similar criticism can be found in the work associated with the '[[Frankfurt School]]' of social research. Antipositivism would be further facilitated by rejections of '[[scientism]]'; or science ''as ideology''. [[Jürgen Habermas]] argues, in his ''On the Logic of the Social Sciences'' (1967), that "the positivist thesis of unified science, which assimilates all the sciences to a natural-scientific model, fails because of the intimate relationship between the social sciences and history, and the fact that they are based on a situation-specific understanding of meaning that can be explicated only [[Hermeneutics|hermeneutically]] ... access to a symbolically prestructured reality cannot be gained by observation alone."&lt;ref&gt;Outhwaite, William, 1988 ''Habermas: Key Contemporary Thinkers'', Polity Press (Second Edition 2009), {{ISBN|978-0-7456-4328-1}} p.22&lt;/ref&gt;

==Structuralism==
[[Structuralism]] was  developed in post-war Paris as a response to the perceived contradiction between the free subject of philosophy and the determined [[subject (philosophy)|subject]] of the human sciences;&lt;ref&gt;Elisabeth Roudinesco, ''Jacques Lacan'' (2005) p. 332&lt;/ref&gt; and drew on the systematic [[linguistics]] of [[Ferdinand de Saussure|Saussure]] for a view of language and culture as a conventional system of signs ''preceding'' the individual subject's entry into them.&lt;ref&gt;R. Appignanesi/C. Garratt, ''Postmodernism for Beginners'' (1995) p. 56-60&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Claude Lévi-Strauss|Lévi-Strauss]] in [[anthropology]] systematised a structuralist analysis of culture in which the individual subject dissolved into a signifying convention;&lt;ref&gt;Appiganesi, p. 66-7&lt;/ref&gt; the [[semiological]] work of [[Roland Barthes]] (1977) decried the cult of the author and indeed proclaimed his death; while [[Jacques Lacan|Lacan]]'s structuralist psychoanalysis inevitably led to a similar diminishment of the concept of the autonomous individual: "man with a discourse on freedom which must certainly be called delusional...produced as it is by an animal at the mercy of language".&lt;ref&gt;Jacques Lacan, ''Écrits: A Selection'' (1997) p. 216 and p. 264&lt;/ref&gt;

Taking a lead from [[Brecht]]'s twin attack on bourgeois ''and'' socialist humanism,&lt;ref&gt;M. Hardt/K. Weeks eds., ''The Jameson Reader'' (2005) p. 150&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt; Zhang, Xudong and Jameson, Fredric, ''Marxism and the Historicity of Theory: An Interview with Fredric Jameson'' https://muse.jhu.edu/article/24419/summary&lt;/ref&gt; [[Marxist philosophy|Marxist philosopher]] [[Louis Althusser]] used the term "antihumanism" in an attack against [[Marxist humanists]], whose position he considered a [[Marxist revisionism|revisionist]] movement. Althusser considered "structure" and "social relations" to have primacy over individual [[consciousness]], opposing the philosophy of the subject.&lt;ref&gt;Simon Choat, ''Marx through Post-Structuralism'' (2010) p. 17&lt;/ref&gt; For Althusser, the beliefs, desires, preferences and judgements of the human individual are the product of social practices, as society moulds the individual in its own image through its [[ideology|ideologies]].

For Marxist humanists such as [[Georg Lukács]], revolution was contingent on the development of the [[class consciousness]] of an historical subject, the [[proletariat]]. In opposition to this, Althusser's antihumanism downplays the role of [[human agency]] in the process of history.

==Post-structuralism and deconstruction==
[[Post-structuralist]]s such as [[Michel Foucault]] and [[Jacques Derrida]] rejected structuralism's insistence on fixed meaning, its privileging of a meta-linguistic standpoint;&lt;ref&gt; {{cite web|url= https://www.academia.edu/3665184/Post_Structuralism | title = Post Structuralism | publisher = Suhandoko Suhandoko | date  =  May 7, 2017| accessdate = January 16, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; but continued all the more to problematize the human subject, favoring the term "the decenter-ed subject" which implies the absence of human agency. Derrida, arguing that the fundamentally ambiguous nature of language makes intention unknowable, attacked Enlightenment perfectionism, and condemned as futile the existentialist quest for authenticity in the face of the all-embracing network of signs. He stressed repeatedly that "the subject is not some meta-linguistic substance or identity, some pure ''cogito'' of self-presence; it is always inscribed in language".&lt;ref&gt;Quoted in John D. Caputo, ''The Tears and Prayers of Jacques Derrida'' (1997) p. 349&lt;/ref&gt;

Foucault challenged the foundational aspects of Enlightenment humanism,&lt;ref&gt;G. Gutting ed., ''The Cambridge Companion to Foucault'' (2003) p. 384&lt;/ref&gt; as well as their strategic implications, arguing that they either produced counter-emancipatory results directly, or matched increased "freedom" with increased and disciplinary normatization.&lt;ref&gt;Gutting, p. 277&lt;/ref&gt; His anti-humanist scepticism extended to attempts to ground theory in human feeling, as much as in human reason, maintaining that both were historically contingent constructs, rather than the universals humanism maintained.&lt;ref&gt; {{cite web|url= http://www.leeds.ac.uk/educol/documents/00003388.htm | title = Foucault and critique: Kant, humanism and the human sciences| publisher = University of Surrey | date  = September 13, 2017| accessdate = January 16, 2018}} &lt;/ref&gt;

==Cultural examples==

The heroine of the novel ''[[Nice Work]]'' begins by defining herself as a semiotic materialist, "a subject position in an infinite web of discourses – the discourses of power, sex, family, science, religion, poetry, etc."&lt;ref&gt;[[David Lodge (author)|David Lodge]], ''Nice Work'' (1988) p. 21-2&lt;/ref&gt; Charged with taking a bleak deterministic view, she retorts, "antihumanist, yes; inhuman, no...the truly determined subject is he who is not aware of the discursive formations that determine him".&lt;ref&gt;Lodge, p. 22&lt;/ref&gt; However, with greater life-experience, she comes closer to accepting that post-structuralism is an intriguing philosophical game, but probably meaningless to those who have not yet even gained awareness of humanism itself.&lt;ref&gt;Lodge, p. 153 and p. 225&lt;/ref&gt; In his critique of humanist approaches to popular film, Timothy Laurie suggests that in new animated films from [[DreamWorks]] and [[Pixar]] "the 'human' is now able to become a site of amoral disturbance, rather than – or at least, in addition to – being a model of exemplary behaviour for junior audiences".&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | title= Becoming-Animal Is A Trap For Humans | first= Timothy | last= Laurie | journal=Deleuze and the Non-Human | year=2015 | url= https://www.academia.edu/10912960}} eds. Hannah Stark and Jon Roffe.&lt;/ref&gt;

The chalcolithic [[Cucuteni-Trypillian culture|Cucuteni-Trypillia culture]], in Eastern Europe, left behind thousands of [[Human settlement|settlement]] ruins, circa 6000 to 3500 BC, containing a wealth of [[Archaeology|archaeological]] [[Artifact (archaeology)|artifacts]] attesting to their [[Archaeological culture|cultural]] and [[Assemblage (archaeology)|technological]] characteristics.&lt;ref name="Mallory"&gt;{{cite book |last1= Mallory|first1= James P|title= In search of the Indo-Europeans: language, archaeology and myth |year=1989 |publisher= Thames and Hudson |location= London |isbn=0-500-05052-X |oclc= 246601873}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Construction techniques==
{{See also|Neolithic architecture}}
The houses of the Cucuteni-Trypillia settlements were constructed in several general ways:
* Wattle and daub homes.
* Log homes, called ({{lang-ru|italic=yes|площадки}} ''ploshchadki'').
* Semi-underground homes called [[Bordei]].
Some Cucuteni-Trypillia homes were two storeys tall, and evidence shows that the members of this culture sometimes decorated the outsides of their homes with many of the same complex red-ochre swirling designs that are to be found on their pottery. Most houses had thatched roofs and wooden floors covered with clay.
Archaeologists have identified two types of [[Timber framing|house framing]] found at Cucuteni-Trypillia sites. One type, somewhat resembling the [[Post and lintel|post and beam]] style, used evenly distributed fork-shaped log pillars that were partially sunk vertically into the ground so that the fork was located at the top and supported the roof beams above. The other type of framing used vertical beams measuring {{cvt|15|–|20|cm|in|disp=x|in diameter (|)}}, or greater, which rested on horizontal ground-sill foundational timbers that were in turn fixed in place on top of the soil.

Most of the walls were built in the [[Wattle and daub|wattle-and-daub]] style. The construction of these houses first started by erecting the framework of larger timbers in place [http://arts.iasi.roedu.net/cucuteni/arheo/casa/123.ridicare.casa.stadiul.1.poz.2.jpg (photo 1)], which would take the weight of the structure, and then the space between these timbers would be filled in with a "wattle" made of pliable smaller branches and vines woven together to form a thin twiggy [[Latticework|latticed]] net which was then affixed to the sturdy timbers [http://arts.iasi.roedu.net/cucuteni/arheo/casa/116.peretele.c.impletitura.orizontala.jpg (photo 2)]. Onto this wattle framework the "daub" would be applied made of mostly dampened clay soil although sometimes mixed with small bits of straw and/or animal dung to help keep its structural integrity ([http://arts.iasi.roedu.net/cucuteni/arheo/casa/145.jpg photo 3]). The daub had to be applied with some force against the wattle in order for it to partially push through the twiggy framework, to which it would stick. Sometimes there would only be a single layer of wattle, and at other times two wattle layers would be used; one for the interior and another for the exterior of the wall. Daub was applied on both sides of the wall, inside and out [http://arts.iasi.roedu.net/cucuteni/arheo/casa/casa.jpg (photo 4)], creating a finished wall that was usually about {{convert|5|cm|in|round=0.5|abbr=on}} thick. Once applied it was smoothed before drying to create an air- and water-tight barrier against the elements [http://arts.iasi.roedu.net/cucuteni/arheo/casa/last.jpg (photo 5)]. After the daub was fully dried, it was usually painted with [[Lime plaster|lime]] to prevent infestations of [[Pest (organism)|pests]].(''note: the photographic examples used in this paragraph were taken from the web page "Recreating a Cucuteni dwelling-house", hosted by The Archaeological Park Cucuteni, see "External Links" at bottom of this article'')&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=Recreating a Cucuteni dwelling-house |publisher=The Archaeological Park Cucuteni |url= http://arts.iasi.roedu.net/cucuteni/arheo/casa/ine.html |language=English, Romanian |accessdate=28 November 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090628222111/http://arts.iasi.roedu.net/cucuteni/arheo/casa/ine.html |archivedate=June 28, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sometimes the walls were made of [[Log home|horizontally laid timbers]] (similar to log homes) that were then covered with clay daub. Some examples have been found where the horizontal timbers were in turn covered with a wattle-and-daub layer. At other times the horizontal timbers would be covered with a layer of primitively finished lumber. There was no standard practice in building walls there during Neolithic times; sometimes, even in the same house, walls would be constructed with horizontal timbers while others would be covered with finished lumber or wattle-and-daub. This type of horizontal log construction found in Cucuteni-Trypillia houses is called {{lang-ru|italic=yes|площадки}} ''ploshchadki'' in Russian.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |last=Darvill |first= Timothy |work= Archaeology Dictionary |title= definition: ploshchadki | publisher= The Concise Oxford Dictionary of Archaeology |year=2003 |url= http://www.answers.com/topic/ploshchadki |format= online system or service |oclc= 425961211 |accessdate=30 November 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |last= Kipfer |first= Barbara Ann |authorlink =Barbara Ann Kipfer&lt;!--http://archaeologywordsmith.com/arch-cv.php--&gt; |work= Archaeology Wordsmith |title= definition: ploshchadki | publisher = Dr. Barbara Ann Kipfer |url= http://archaeologywordsmith.com/lookup.php?terms=ploshchadki |format= online system or service |accessdate=25 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Bordei dwellings==
{{See also|Bordei}}
Some of the houses found by archeologists were [[Dugout (shelter)|dugout]] [[earth house]]s, of the style called ''bordei'' in both Romanian ({{lang-ro |italic=yes|bordei}}) and Ukrainian ({{lang-ua|italic=yes|бордей}}). Unlike surface dwellings characterized by walls with right angles and rectangular shapes the bordei houses were characterized by elliptical shapes. These houses would typically have a wooden [[floor]] that was about {{convert|1.5|m|ft|abbr=off|sp=us}} below ground, which would place the roof at just above ground level.&lt;ref name="Sorochin" /&gt; Images of bordei homes may be seen at the Romanian Art Zone page&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|last=Grigorescu |first=Nicolae |title=Bordei in padure |trans-title=Bordei in the forest |publisher=Art Zone |date=1838–1907 |url=http://art-zone.ro/picturi/ng/2/Bordei_in_padure_nicolae_grigorescu.html |postscript=An online reproduction of an oil painting done by Romanian artist Nicolae Grigorescu (1838—1907) |accessdate=6 December 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090201190925/http://art-zone.ro/picturi/ng/2/Bordei_in_padure_nicolae_grigorescu.html |archivedate=1 February 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==House interior==
[[File:Cucuteni House Clay Model.jpg|thumb|320px|left|Clay Model of house interior with two fireplaces]]
Most of the Cucuteni-Trypillia houses were arranged by locating the front door opposite from where the [[fireplace]] sat. Large ceramic pottery containers used to store water and grain were placed next to the fireplace. Other ceramic containers, including the more valuable painted pottery, would also be located near the fireplace. Some of the fine painted pottery for which this culture is known would be used for clothing storage but most of it seems to have been used in rituals.&lt;ref name="Monah"&gt;{{Citation |first=Dan |last=Monah |author-link=Dan Monah &lt;!--http://www.arheo.ro/text/colectiv/Pagini_personale/Monah%20Dan.html--&gt; |editor-last=Dumitroaia |editor-first=Gheorghe |contribution = Religie si arta in cultura Cucuteni (Religion and art in Cucuteni culture) |booktitle=Primul muzeu Cucuteni din Romania |title=Muzeul Cucuteni prima pentru Romania |trans-title=The first Cucuteni museum for Romania |series=Bibliotheca memoriae antiquitatis XV |year=2005 |pages=162–173 |place=Piatra-Neamț, Romania |publisher=Editura Foton |language=Romanian |oclc=319165024}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The number of fireplaces found within each house varied from just one (which was the most common) to several, or even none. Each of the fireplaces found in houses that had more than one would have its own specific use such as one for cooking, one for [[Kiln|firing ceramics]], etc. Most Cucuteni-Trypillia fireplaces were a type of open [[fire pit]] and were usually constructed on the floor by laying down a bed of clay mixed with broken pottery shards and then covering this with a smooth clay-plastered surface.

It is assumed that furniture was extensively used however, due to the climate of this region, wood does not preserve well here. However some of the many miniature clay figurines found at Cucuteni-Trypillia sites were placed sitting or reclining on different pieces of furniture, some of which resemble sofas, chairs, or even ovens. There is also some evidence of furniture being incorporated into the structure of the walls of houses by using woven branches covered with clay.&lt;ref name="Krichevski"&gt;{{Cite journal | last = Кричевский  (Krichevski) | first = Евгений Юрьевич (Evgeniye Yurivich) | title = Трипольские площадки ; по раскопкам последних лет (Triploskiye ploshchadki : po raskopkam poslednič let) |trans-title=Trypillian ploshchadki : on the excavations of recent years | journal = Советская археология (''Sovyetskaya arkheologiya'' Soviet Archeology) | volume = 6 | publisher = институтом археологии АН СССР (Archeological Institute A.N.

In 1841 the [[Birmingham and Gloucester Railway]] successfully used American [[Norris Locomotive Works|Norris]] [[4-2-0]] locomotives on the notorious [[Lickey Incline]] and Hick built three similar locomotives for the line. Between 1844 and 1846 the firm built a number of [[Long Boiler locomotive|"long boiler" locomotives]] with haystack fireboxes and in 1848, four [[2-4-0]]s for the [[North Staffordshire Railway]].{{sfnp|Saul|1968|pages= 186–222 }}{{sfnp|Christiansen|Miller|1971|page= 309}}&lt;ref name="Skeat and Marshall 1974"&gt;{{cite book|last=Skeat |last2=Marshall|first=W.

== Engineering Drawings ==
Hick Hargreaves collection of early locomotive and steam engine drawings&lt;ref name='Short'/&gt; represents one of the finest of its kind in the world. The majority were produced by Benjamin Hick senior and John Hick between 1833-1855, they are of significant interest for their technical detail, fine draughtsmanship and artistic merit.&lt;ref name="Skeat and Marshall 1974"/&gt; The elaborate finish and harmonious colouring extends from the largest drawings for prospective customers to ordinary working drawings and records for the engineer.

Works like this influenced the contemporary illustrators of popular science and technology of the time like John Emslie (1813-1875), their aesthetic quality stems from a [[Romanticism|romantic outlook]] in which science and poetry were partners.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Klingender|first1=Francis Donald|authorlink=Francis Klingender|editor1-last=Elton|editor1-first=Arthur|title=Art and the Industrial Revolution|date=1968|publisher=Augustus M.

In 1908 the company was licensed to build [[Uniflow steam engine|uniflow engines]]. From 1911 the company began the manufacture of large [[diesel engine]]s, however these did not prove successful and were eventually discontinued.  Boiler production finished in 1912. During [[World War I]] the company was involved in war work,&lt;ref name='WIAS'/&gt; producing [[Naval mine|mines]], 6 and 9.2 inch [[shell (projectile)|shells]]&lt;ref name='Lewis'/&gt; and [[Diesel engine|oil engines]] for [[submarines]].{{sfnp|Halton|2001|page= 25 }}

In the early hours 26 September 1916, the works were targeted  by [[LZ 61 (Zeppelin 'L 21')|Zeppelin L 21]]; a bomb missed passing through the roof of nearby [[Holy Trinity Church, Bolton|Holy Trinity Church]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Hamer|first1=Phil|editor1-last=Jackson|editor1-first=Terence|title=ZEPPELIN OVER BOLTON|journal=Up the Line|date=November 2011|page=2|url=http://www.westernfrontassociation.com/attachments/article/4049/Lancs_Cheshire_Nov_2011.pdf|accessdate=29 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The company's [[recoil]] gear for the [[Vickers]] [[Ordnance QF 18 pounder|18 pounder quick firing gun]] was so successful that by war's end a significant part of the factory was devoted to its production. Civil manufacture was not suspended entirely and in 1916 the firm began making [[Injector|two-stage steam jet air ejectors]] and high [[vacuum]] condensing plant for [[power generation]]. Its production was greatly expanded as [[Distributed generation|centralised power generation]] was adopted in Great Britain,{{sfnp|Pilling|1985|page= 20 }}&lt;ref name='WIAS'/&gt; by the formation of the [[Central Electricity Board]] (CEB) in 1926.{{sfnp|Halton|2001|page= 25 }}

After the war the firm entered a contract with the [[Vulcan (motor vehicles)|Vulcan Motor &amp; Engineering Co]] of [[Southport]] for 1000 20&amp;nbsp;hp [[petrol engine]]s, but work was discontinued in 1922 when Vulcan became bankrupt, with only 150 completed.&lt;ref name='Lewis'/&gt;

As the [[steam turbine]] replaced [[Reciprocating engine|reciprocating steam engines]] Hick Hargreaves' development continued, by 1927 its engine work was principally steam turbines for [[Power station|electricity generating stations]] and the company became a major supplier to the CEB.{{sfnp|Halton|2001|page= 25 }}

During the 1930s Hick, Hargreaves acquired the records, drawings and patterns of four defunct steam engine manufacturers: [[J &amp; E Wood]], [[John Musgrave &amp; Sons|John Musgrave &amp; Sons Limited]], [[W &amp; J Galloway &amp; Sons|Galloways Limited]] and [[Scott &amp; Hodgson Ltd|Scott &amp; Hodgson Limited]].

In 1968 the Hargreaves family sold the company to Electrical &amp; Industrial Securities Ltd. In 2001, the firm was bought by [[The BOC Group]] from [[Smiths Group|Smiths Industries]].

He is known for his research in Northern Mexico and the [[American Southwest]].

== Biography ==
Di Peso's first field experience was at Ackmen, Colorado in 1937. In 1941 Di Peso returned to the field to conduct work in [[New Mexico]]. Both of these were headed by the [[Field Museum]] in [[Chicago]]. 
Di Peso earned a B.A in anthropology and a B.S. in geology from [[Beloit College]] in 1942.&lt;ref name=book /&gt;

After graduation Di Peso joined the [[U.S. Air Force]] and was a pilot during [[World War II]] and was discharged in 1946.&lt;ref name=book /&gt; During his time in the Air Force Di Peso was stationed in [[Phoenix, Arizona]] where he lived after the war becoming the archaeologist for the city.&lt;ref name=book /&gt;

In 1947 Di Peso received a B.F.T. from the American Institute of Foreign Trade.  He received his [[Master of Arts|M.A.]] from the [[University of Arizona]] in 1950 and earned his [[PhD]] from there in 1953 becoming the first student at that institution to earn that degree in anthropology. There, he was a student of the famous Southwest archaeologist [[Emil Haury]] who influenced him greatly throughout his career.&lt;ref name=web2&gt;[http://books.nap.edu/readingroom/books/biomems/ehaury.html Emil Walter Haury, May 2, 1904 – December 5, 1992] By Raymond Harris Thompson, [[Caleb Vance Haynes, Jr.]], and James Jefferson Reid. Biographical Memoirs]&lt;/ref&gt;

Di Peso first worked for the [[Amerind Foundation]] in 1948 and in 1954 became the director which he held until his death in 1982.&lt;ref name=book&gt;Woosley, Anne I., and John C. Ravesloot (Editors) (1993) ''Culture and Contact: Charles C. Di Peso's Gran Chichimeca''. University of New Mexico Press, Albuquerque&lt;/ref&gt; Di Peso is best known for his excavation, analysis, and interpretation of archaeological materials from Paquimé, also known as Casas Grandes, beginning in 1959. According to Di Peso, Paquimé was established by Mesoamerican merchants in order to control trade between Mesoamerica and the Southwest. While this assertion continues to be controversial, Di Peso's work at Paquimé had the effect of drawing archaeologists' attention to a long-ignored part of North America.

'''Chyhyryn''' ({{lang-uk|Чигири́н}}, {{IPA-uk|tʃɪɦɪˈrɪn|pron}}) is a city and important historic site located in the [[Cherkasy Oblast]] of central [[Ukraine]]. From 1648 to 1669 the city was a Hetman residence. After a forced relocation of the Ruthenian Orthodox metropolitan see from Kiev in 1658, it became a full-fledged capital of the [[Cossack Hetmanate]]. Chyhyryn also became a traditional place for the appointment to the office of [[Hetmans of Ukrainian Cossacks|Hetman of Zaporizhian Host]]. Chyhyryn serves as administrative center of [[Chyhyryn Raion]].

== Names ==

Chyhyryn ({{lang-uk|Чигирин}}) or Chigirin ({{lang-ru|Чигири́н}}) {{lang-pl|Czehryń}}, [[Turkish language|Turkish]]: ''Çigirin'' or ''Çehrin''

== Location ==
Today the city on the banks of [[Tiasmyn River]] is the administrative center of the [[Chyhyryn Raion]]. The city lies at an altitude of 124 metres [[above mean sea level]]. Minor industries, such as food and furniture factories, are the basis of the town economy in the 21st century. 

== History ==
The area (1320–1569) had been part of the [[Grand Duchy of Lithuania]]. It was ceded to the [[Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth]] (in the [[Kijów Voivodeship]] of the [[Crown of Poland]]) before the [[Union of Lublin]]. It was granted [[Magdeburg rights|Magdeburg Rights]] in 1592 by [[Sigismund III Vasa]].

[[File:Czehryn, by Jan Jansson, circa 1663.jpg|thumb|left|200px|Chyhyryn on the [[Tiasmin River]]. A fragment of the ''Tractus Borysthenis Vulgo Dniepr at Niepr dicti'' map by Joannii Janssonii ([[Amsterdam]], 1663)]]
Chyhyryn is first mentioned as a fortified [[Cossack]] winter station. In 1638, [[Bohdan Khmelnytsky]] became its [[starosta]] (regional leader), and in 1648 it became the newly elected [[Hetman]]'s residence and the capital of the Cossack state, the [[Zaporozhian Host]]. During the [[Russo-Turkish War (1676–1681)]] it was the center of two bloody campaigns (1675–76 and 1677–78). In 1678 the castle of Chyhyryn was blown up by the retreating Russian garrison that was stationed there, while the Turkish forces sacked the rest of the city. After this, it gradually lost its significance. It remained the center of the [[Chyhyryn regiment]] until 1712 and upon the final incorporation into the [[Russian Empire]] (1793) it became part of the [[Kiev]] region.

In 1917 a congress of [[Free Cossacks]] took place in Chyhyryn. At that congress by tradition [[Pavlo Skoropadsky]] was elected as the Hetman of the Cossacks (later in 1918 in [[Kiev]], he was elected the [[Hetman of Ukraine]] as well).

During [[World War II]], Chyhyryn was occupied by the [[Wehrmacht|German Army]] from [[Operation Barbarossa|August 7, 1941]] to [[Battle of the Dnieper|December 12, 1943]].

In 1989 the population of the city was 12 853 people.&lt;ref&gt;[http://demoscope.ru/weekly/ssp/sng89_reg2.php Всесоюзная перепись населения 1989 г. Численность городского населения союзных республик, их территориальных единиц, городских поселений и городских районов по полу]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Landmarks==
The Trinity Monastery, built near Chyhyryn in 1627, was later destroyed by the [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] authorities. Other historical landmarks, such as the town hall and Khmelnytsky's palace, did not survive either. After Ukraine regained independence, Hetman's residence was restored and became a museum.

'''Cropmarks''' or '''crop marks''' are a means through which sub-surface [[archaeological]], natural and recent features may be visible [[aerial archaeology|from the air]] or a vantage point on higher ground or a temporary platform. Along with [[parch mark]]s,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.armadale.org.uk/rufford.htm#red|title=Parch marks at Rufford Abbey (Near infra-red KAP) |accessdate=2012-12-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[soil mark]]s and [[frost mark]]s can reveal buried archaeological sites not visible from the ground.

==Description==
[[Image:Diagramm bewuchs.jpg|thumb|300px|right|Sketched diagram of a '''negative cropmark''' above a wall and a '''positive cropmark''' above a ditch]]
[[File:Kite aerial photo of crop marks at Nesley, near Tetbury, Gloucestershire.jpg|thumbnail|right|Kite aerial photo of crop marks at Nesley, near Tetbury, Gloucestershire. Cereal crop left, beans right.  The relative intensity in the crops was reversed in the near infra-red.]]

Crop marks appear due to the principle of differential growth. One of the factors controlling the growth of vegetation is the condition of the soil. A buried [[stone wall]], for example, will affect crop growth above it, as its presence channels water away from its area and occupies the space of the more fertile soil. Conversely, a buried [[ditch]], with a fill containing more organic matter than the natural earth, provides much more conducive conditions and water will naturally collect there, nourishing the plants growing above.

The differences in conditions will cause some plants to grow more strongly and therefore taller, and others less strongly and therefore shorter. Some species will also react through differential ripening of their fruits or their overall colour. 

Particularly effective crops that exhibit differential growth include [[cereal]] crops, [[pea]]s, and [[potato]]es. 

Differential growth will naturally follow any features buried below. Although the growth differences may appear small close up, from the air the pattern they make is more visible, as the small changes can be seen as marked differences in tone or colour in the context of the normally growing surrounding vegetation. When the sun is low to the horizon, shadows cast by the taller crops can also become visible.

By their nature crop marks are visible only seasonally and may not be visible at all except in exceptionally wet or dry years. [[Drought]]s can be especially useful to cropmark hunters, as the differential growth can become apparent in normally hardy species such as grass. The drought of 2010 produced particularly good conditions for observing crop marks in the UK.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-11128297 BBC news, reporting English Heritage]&lt;/ref&gt; Pre-parching stress in crops and grass, and others factors that may affect plant health, can be captured in near infra-red photography.

[[File:Roman Road - The Via Julia, Bristol.jpg|thumb|Roman Road - The Via Julia, Bristol]]

An alternative approach is thermal imaging, where differential water loss (which is dependent of the availability of water at the roots) can create temperature differences, which result in thermal crop marks that are potentially visible at any time during crop growth.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.univie.ac.at/aarg/aerarch/papers/Thermal.pdf |title=Thermal prospecting on vegetation |accessdate=2012-12-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thermal imaging can also reveal archaeological residues as a result of thermal inertia (storage heater effect) or differential evaporation. The interaction of the processes involved can be complex and the prediction of optimal imaging time, for a given site, further complicated by environmental conditions including temperature variation and relative humidity.

The usefulness of cropmarks to archaeologists has largely been a fruit of inspection from aircraft, but the possibility was suggested by Rev. [[Gilbert White]] in ''[[The Natural History of Selborne]]'' (1789), in a note appended to his Letter VI, to Thomas Pennant, apropos of local people's success in searching for [[bog-wood|bog oak]] for house construction, by discovering these trees "by the hoar frost, which lay longer over the space where they were concealed, than on the surrounding morass." To White it suggested the query "might not such observations be reduced to domestic use, by promoting the discovery of old obliterated drains and wells about houses; and in Roman stations and camps lead to the finding of pavements, baths and graves, and other hidden relics of curious antiquity?"

==Examples==
[[File:Aa lawn flagstones cropmark.jpg|right|thumb|After a long hot dry period, cropmark on a lawn caused by a line of [[flagstone]]s which the grass had overgrown and buried.]]
Examples of archaeological sites where cropmarks have been observed are [[Balbridie]] and [[Fetteresso Castle|Fetteresso]] in [[Scotland]].

In 2009, investigation of crop marks near [[Stonehenge]] revealed a variety of 6,000-year-old prehistoric subterranean structures.&lt;ref name="natgeo"&gt;{{cite news|publisher=National Geographic|date=2009-06-15|url=http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2009/06/090615-stonehenge-tombs-crop-circles.html|title=Huge Pre-Stonehenge Complex Found via "Crop Circles"|author=James Owen}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another example is the rediscovery of the Roman city [[Altinum]], a precursor to the city of [[Venice]], from a combination of visible and near-infrared photos of the area taken during a drought in 2007,  which stressed the maize and soy crops. &lt;ref&gt; Ninfo A., Fontana A., Mozzi P., Ferrarese F. 2009. The Map of Altinum, Ancestor of Venice. Science 31 July 2009:  Vol. 325 no. 5940 p. 577 &lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Mucking excavation|multi period site at Mucking]] was discovered as a result of aerial photographs showing cropmarks and soil marks. The earliest photographs to reveal the site were taken by the [[Luftwaffe]] in 1943.&lt;ref name=Clark&gt;Clark, A. 1993. ''Excavations at Mucking, Volume 1: The Site Atlas'' (English Heritage Archaeological Report 20)&lt;/ref&gt; The importance of the site was recognised following photographs taken by [[Kenneth Joseph]] in 1959&lt;ref name=Clark/&gt; (published in 1964).&lt;ref&gt;JK St Joseph, ''Air reconnaissance: recent results'' (Antiquity, vol 38, pp 217-218)&lt;/ref&gt; In 1982, Margaret Jones (site director at the Mucking excavation) noted that some sites were being interpreted on crop mark evidence alone. She pointed out that some features do not produce crop marks and that some crop marks, when excavated, turn out not to be what they seem.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|first=Margaret|last=Jones|title=Jottings from Mucking post-excavation|journal=Panorama|volume=25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Elizabeth Lewisohn Eisenstein''' (October 11, 1923&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Locher |first=Frances C. |title=Contemporary Authors |publisher=Gale |year=1980 |isbn=0810300486 |page=152 }}&lt;/ref&gt; – January 31, 2016&lt;ref&gt;{{cite mailing list |url=https://list.indiana.edu/sympa/arc/exlibris-l/2016-02/msg00076.html |title=Elizabeth Eisenstein |date=February 4, 2016 |accessdate=February 5, 2016 |mailing-list=EXLIBRIS-L |last=Patkus |first=Ron}}&lt;/ref&gt;) was an American historian of the [[French Revolution]] and early 19th-century France. She is well known for her work on the history of early [[printing]], writing on the transition in media between the era of '[[manuscript culture]]' and that of '[[print culture]]', as well as the role of the [[printing press]] in effecting broad cultural change in [[Western culture|Western civilization]].

==Career==
Eisenstein was educated at [[Vassar College]] where she received her B.A., then went on to [[Radcliffe College]] for her M.A. and Ph.D. It was there she studied under [[Crane Brinton]].  She reported that in the early 1950's she was not able to find a position in a university history department, not even part-time work. In 1957, after she had obtained her PhD, she and her husband moved to Washington, D.C. where she applied to multiple institutions for teaching positions, including Georgetown, George Washington University, Howard, and the University of Maryland. She eventually found a part-time position at [[American University]].&lt;ref name=baron&gt;{{cite book|last1=Baron|first1=Sabina Alcorn|title=Agent of Change|date=2007|publisher=University of Massachusetts Press|location=Amherst|isbn=978-1-55849-593-7|page=410}}&lt;/ref&gt;

She taught as an [[Adjunct professor#Adjunct professor|adjunct professor]]&lt;ref name=gleick /&gt; at [[American University]] from 1959 to 1974, then the [[University of Michigan]], where she was the [[Alice Freeman Palmer]] Professor of History.&lt;ref&gt;Cherry Williams, "Analytical Intellectual Biography of Elizabeth L. Eisenstein" (student paper, UCLA, 2004), 27.  Student Digital Library, IS 281.  {{cite web |url=http://www.gseis.ucla.edu/faculty/maack/StudentLibrary.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2007-05-03 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070213152952/http://www.gseis.ucla.edu/faculty/maack/StudentLibrary.htm |archivedate=2007-02-13 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1979 she was resident consultant for the [[Center for the Book]] at the Library of Congress.&lt;ref&gt;The Library of Congress.  "Book and Library History Update (November 2001) - Library of Congress Information Bulletin."  https://www.loc.gov/lov/lcib/0111/cfb.html&lt;/ref&gt;

She held positions as a fellow at the Humanities Research Center of the [[Australian National University]] and at the [[Center for Advanced Study in the Behavioral Sciences]] (Palo Alto).&lt;ref name=baron /&gt; Eisenstein was visiting professor at [[Wolfson College, Oxford]], and published her lectures from that period as ''Grub Street Abroad''. She was professor emerita at the University of Michigan&lt;ref&gt;Elizabeth L. Eisenstein, "An Unacknowledged Revolution Revisited," ''American Historical Review'' 107, no. 1 (February 2002): 105.&lt;/ref&gt; and an honorary fellow of [[St Cross College, Oxford]].

Her last work was ''[[Divine Art, Infernal Machine]], the Reception of Printing in the West'' (Penn Press, 2011).

==Family and Personal Life==
Eisenstein is the third daughter of [[Sam A. Lewisohn]], son of [[Adolph Lewisohn]] and Margaret Seligman, granddaughter of [[Joseph Seligman]] and Babet Steinhardt.

From the age of 50, Eisenstein began competing in senior tennis tournaments, becoming well-known and winning three national grand slams between 2003-2005.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.washingtoncitypaper.com/news/article/13031769/the-assassin&lt;/ref&gt;

==''The Printing Press as an Agent of Change''==
[[File:Elizabeth Eisenstein - From scribal scarcity to the disruptive text.webm|thumb|Eisenstein describes the conditions of scarcity that characterized the book as artifact in the age of the scribe.]]
Eisenstein's best-known work is ''The Printing Press as an Agent of Change'', a two-volume, 750-page exploration of the effects of [[movable type]] printing on the literate elite of post-Gutenberg Western Europe.  In this work she focuses on the printing press's functions of dissemination, standardization, and preservation and the way these functions aided the progress of the [[Protestant Reformation]], the [[Renaissance]], and the [[Scientific Revolution]].  Eisenstein's work brought [[historical method]], rigor, and clarity to earlier ideas of [[Marshall McLuhan]] and others, about the general social effects of such media transitions.&lt;ref name=gleick&gt;{{cite book | author = [[James Gleick]] | title = [[The Information: A History, a Theory, a Flood]] | publisher = Pantheon | year = 2011 | place = New York | isbn = 978-0-375-42372-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This work provoked debate in the academic community from the moment it was published&lt;ref&gt;Peter F. McNally, ed., ''The Advent of Printing: Historians of Science Respond to Elizabeth Eisenstein's "The Printing Press as an Agent of Change"'' (Montreal: McGill University Graduate School of Library and Information Studies, 1987).&lt;/ref&gt; and is still inspiring conversation and new research today.&lt;ref&gt;Sabrina Alcorn Baron, Eric N. Lindquist, and Eleanor F. Shevlin, eds.  ''Agent of Change: Print Culture Studies After Elizabeth L. Eisenstein'' (Amherst: [[University of Massachusetts Press]], 2007).&lt;/ref&gt;  Her work also influenced later thinking about the subsequent development of [[digital media]]. Her work on the transition from manuscript to print influenced thought about new transitions of print text to digital formats, including [[multimedia]] and new ideas about the definition of text.&lt;ref&gt;James A. Dewar, ''The Information Age and the Printing Press:  Looking Backward to See Ahead'', RAND Paper 8014 (Santa Monica, CA: RAND, 1998), https://www.rand.org/pubs/papers/P8014&lt;/ref&gt;

Eisenstein’s book has also received sharp criticism.  Paul Needham, now Librarian at [[Princeton University]]’s [[Scheide Library]], described it as "almost impossible to comprehend" and suffering "from more general flaws of historical method: an unconcern for exact chronology; a lack of historical context; an exclusive reliance of [sic] secondary writings, not always accurately absorbed, not always particularly relevant …"   &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Needham |first= Paul |last2= |first2= |date= January 1980|title= Review: Eisenstein, Elizabeth L., The Printing Press as an Agent of Social Change |url= |journal= Fine Print|volume= VI|issue=1 |pages= 23-35 |doi=  |access-date= }} &lt;/ref&gt;

==The Unacknowledged Revolution==

Eisenstein's book ''The Printing Press as an Agent of Change'' lays out her thoughts on the "Unacknowledged Revolution," her name for the revolution that occurred after the invention of print.  Print media allowed the general public to have access to books and knowledge that had not been available to them before; this led to the growth of public knowledge and individual thought.  The ability to formulate thought on one's own thoughts became reality with the popularity of the printing press.  Print also "standardized and preserved knowledge which had been much more fluid in the age of oral manuscript circulation"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Briggs|first1=Asa|last2=Burke|first2=Peter|date=2005 |title=A Social History of the Media: from Gutenberg to the Internet|edition=second |publisher=Polity |place=Cambridge}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Eisenstein recognizes this period of time to be very important in the development of human culture; however, she feels that it is often overlooked, thus, the 'unacknowledged revolution'.

==Awards==
Eisenstein has received various awards and recognitions, including fellowships from the [[John Simon Guggenheim Memorial Foundation]], the [[National Endowment for the Humanities]], and the [[Rockefeller Foundation]].  In 2002, she received the [[American Historical Association]]'s Award for Scholarly Distinction,&lt;ref&gt;American Historical Association, "2002 Book Awards and Prizes," http://www.historians.org/annual/2003/2002prizes.htm&lt;/ref&gt; and in 2004 the University of Michigan awarded her the honorary degree of [[Doctor of Humane Letters]].&lt;ref&gt;University of Michigan, "U-M to bestow two honorary degrees," http://www.umich.edu/~urecord/0405/Nov22_04/06.shtml&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1993, the National Coalition of Independent Scholars created the ''Eisenstein Prize'', which is awarded biannually to members of the organization who have produced work with an independent focus.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ncis.org/ Independent Scholars&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

He achieved wide recognition in his day and—while primarily influential within the [[Continental philosophy|continental]] tradition of philosophy—has become increasingly influential in the [[Analytic philosophy|analytic]] tradition as well.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://plato.stanford.edu/archives/spr2014/entries/hegel/|title=Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel|first=Redding|last=Paul|authorlink=Paul Redding|date=13 February 1997|publisher=[[Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although Hegel remains a divisive figure, his canonical stature within [[Western philosophy]] is universally recognized.

Hegel's principal achievement was his development of a distinctive articulation of [[idealism]], sometimes termed ''[[absolute idealism]]'',&lt;ref&gt;This term is actually quite rare in Hegel's writings. It does not occur anywhere in ''The Science of Logic'' (though he comes close in a remark on p. 124 of the [2010] di Giovanni translation, GW 21.142). In the ''Encyclopedia'' presentation of his logic it can be found only at §45R. Greraets, Suchting and Harris note in the introduction to their translation of this later text that the term is more strongly associated with English movement in that later part of the 19th century (Hackett: 1991, xiii).&lt;/ref&gt; in which the dualisms of, for instance, mind and nature and [[Subject (philosophy)|subject]] and [[Object (philosophy)|object]] are overcome. His philosophy of spirit conceptually integrates psychology, the state, history, art, religion and philosophy. His account of the [[master–slave dialectic]] has been highly influential, especially in 20th-century France.&lt;ref&gt;Overwhelmingly due to [[Alexandre Kojève]]'s influential lectures published as ''Introduction à la lecture de Hegel'' (Paris, 1947), selections translated into English by James Nichols as ''Introduction to the Reading of Hegel'' (New York, 1969). See, for instance, Aimé Patri, "Dialectique du Maître et de l’Esclave", Le Contrat Social, V, No. a (July–August 196r), 234, cited in Editor's Introduction (vii) on the extent of their influence.&lt;/ref&gt; Of special importance is his concept of spirit (''[[Geist]]'', sometimes also translated as "mind") as the historical manifestation of the logical concept and the [[Aufheben|"sublation"]] (''Aufhebung'', integration without [[Reduction (philosophy)|elimination or reduction]]) of seemingly contradictory or opposing factors: examples include the apparent opposition between nature and [[Freedom of will|freedom]] and between [[immanence]] and [[Transcendence (philosophy)|transcendence]]. Hegel has been seen in the 20th century as the originator of the [[thesis, antithesis, synthesis]] triad,&lt;ref&gt;[[Robert C. Solomon]], ''In the Spirit of Hegel'', Oxford University Press, p. 23.&lt;/ref&gt; but as an explicit phrase it originated with [[Johann Gottlieb Fichte]].&lt;ref name=Fichte&gt;"Review of ''[[Aenesidemus (book)|Aenesidemus]]''" ([http://www.gleichsatz.de/b-u-t/trad/fichte/jgf-aenesidemus.html "Rezension des Aenesidemus"], ''{{Interlanguage link multi|Allgemeine Literatur-Zeitung|de}}'', February 11–12, 1794).

Hegel has influenced many thinkers and writers whose own positions vary widely.&lt;ref&gt;"One of the few things on which the analysts, pragmatists, and existentialists agree with the dialectical theologians is that Hegel is to be repudiated: their attitude toward Kant, Aristotle, Plato, and the other great philosophers is not at all unanimous even within each movement; but opposition to Hegel is part of the platform of all four, and of the Marxists, too." [[Walter Kaufmann (philosopher)|Walter Kaufmann]], [http://www.marxists.org/reference/subject/philosophy/works/us/kaufmann.htm "The Hegel Myth and Its Method"] in ''From Shakespeare to Existentialism: Studies in Poetry, Religion, and Philosophy'', Beacon Press, Boston, 1959 (pp.&amp;nbsp;88–119).&lt;/ref&gt; [[Karl Barth]] described Hegel as a "Protestant [[Thomas Aquinas|Aquinas]]"&lt;ref&gt;"Why did Hegel not become for the Protestant world something similar to what Thomas Aquinas was for Roman Catholicism?" (Karl Barth, ''Protestant Thought from Rousseau to Ritschl: Being the Translation Of Eleven Chapters of Die Protestantische Theologie im 19. Jahrhundert'', 268 Harper, 1959).&lt;/ref&gt; while [[Maurice Merleau-Ponty]] wrote that "all the great philosophical ideas of the past century—the philosophies of [[Karl Marx|Marx]] and [[Friedrich Nietzsche|Nietzsche]], [[phenomenology (philosophy)|phenomenology]], German [[existentialism]], and [[psychoanalysis]]—had their beginnings in Hegel."&lt;ref&gt;Maurice Merleau-Ponty (trans. Herbert L. and Patricia Allen Dreyfus), ''Sense and Nonsense'', Northwestern University Press, 1964, p. 63.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Life ==
=== Early years ===
==== Childhood ====
[[File:Stuttgart-Hegel-Birthplace-2006-04-09a.jpg|thumb|left|The birthplace of Hegel in [[Stuttgart]], which now houses the Hegel Museum]]
He was born on August 27, 1770 in [[Stuttgart]], capital of the [[Duchy of Württemberg]] in southwestern Germany. Christened Georg Wilhelm Friedrich, he was known as Wilhelm to his close family. His father, Georg Ludwig, was ''Rentkammersekretär'' (secretary to the revenue office) at the court of [[Karl Eugen, Duke of Württemberg]].&lt;ref name=pinkard/&gt;{{rp|2–3, 745}} Hegel's mother, Maria Magdalena Louisa (née Fromm), was the daughter of a lawyer at the High Court of Justice at the Württemberg court. She died of a "bilious fever" (''Gallenfieber'') when Hegel was thirteen. Hegel and his father also caught the disease, but they narrowly survived.&lt;ref&gt;Pinkard, ''Hegel: A Biography'', p. 3, incorrectly gives the date as September 20, 1781, and describes Hegel as aged eleven. Cf. the index to Pinkard's book and his "Chronology of Hegel's Life", which correctly give the date as 1783 (pp. 773, 745); see also [[:de:Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel#Studien und Interessen|German Wikipedia]].&lt;/ref&gt; Hegel had a sister, Christiane Luise (1773–1832); and a brother, Georg Ludwig (1776–1812), who was to perish as an officer in Napoleon's Russian campaign of 1812.&lt;ref name=pinkard/&gt;{{rp|4}}

At the age of three, he went to the German School. When he entered the Latin School two years later, he already knew the [[first declension]], having been taught it by his mother. In 1776, he entered Stuttgart's ''[[gymnasium illustre]]'' and during his adolescence read voraciously, copying lengthy extracts in his diary. Authors he read include the poet [[Friedrich Gottlieb Klopstock]] and writers associated with the [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]], such as [[Christian Garve]] and [[Gotthold Ephraim Lessing]]. His studies at the ''Gymnasium'' were concluded with his ''[[Abitur]]rede'' ("graduation speech") entitled "The abortive state of art and scholarship in Turkey"&lt;ref name=pinkard/&gt;{{rp|16}} ("den verkümmerten Zustand der Künste und Wissenschaften unter den Türken").&lt;ref&gt;[[Karl Rosenkranz]], ''Hegels Leben'', Duncker und Humblot, 1844, p. 19.&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Tübingen (1788–1793) ====
At the age of eighteen, Hegel entered the [[Tübinger Stift]] (a Protestant seminary attached to the [[University of Tübingen]]), where he had as roommates the poet and philosopher [[Friedrich Hölderlin]] and the philosopher-to-be [[Friedrich Wilhelm Joseph Schelling]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The Cambridge Companion to Hegel |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=N1ohAwAAQBAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover | editor=[[Frederick C. Beiser|Beiser, Frederick C.]] |publisher=[[Cambridge University Press]] |year=1993 |page=[https://books.google.com/books?id=N1ohAwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT419&amp;dq=%22Hegel%22%22Tübinger+Stift.+1789–1790+shares+a+roomwith+Hölderlin+and+Schelling+and+forms+friendship+with+them%22 419]| id={{ISBN|1-13982495-3}}}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sharing a dislike for what they regarded as the restrictive environment of the Seminary, the three became close friends and mutually influenced each other's ideas. All greatly admired Hellenic civilization and Hegel additionally steeped himself in [[Jean-Jacques Rousseau]] and Lessing during this time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Harris|first=H.S.|title=Phenomenology and System|date=1995|page=7}}&lt;/ref&gt; They watched the unfolding of the [[French Revolution]] with shared enthusiasm. Schelling and Hölderlin immersed themselves in theoretical debates on [[Kantian philosophy]], from which Hegel remained aloof. Hegel at this time envisaged his future as that of a ''Popularphilosoph'', i.e. a "man of letters" who serves to make the abstruse ideas of philosophers accessible to a wider public; his own felt need to engage critically with the central ideas of Kantianism did not come until 1800. 

Although the violence of the [[Reign of Terror]] in 1793 dampened Hegel's hopes, he continued to identify with the moderate [[Girondin]] faction and never lost his commitment to the principles of 1789, which he would express by drinking a toast to the [[storming of the Bastille]] every fourteenth of July.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Good |first1=James Allan |title=A Search for Unity in Diversity: The "Permanent Hegelian Deposit" in the Philosophy of John Dewey |date=2006 |publisher=Lexington Books |page=4}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

==== Bern (1793–1796) and Frankfurt (1797–1801) ====
Having received his theological certificate (''[[consistory (Protestantism)|Konsistorial]]examen'') from the Tübingen Seminary, Hegel became ''Hofmeister'' (house tutor) to an aristocratic family in [[Bern]] (1793–1796). During this period, he composed the text which has become known as the ''[[Life of Jesus (Hegel)|Life of Jesus]]'' and a book-length manuscript titled "The Positivity of the Christian Religion". His relations with his employers becoming strained. Hegel accepted an offer mediated by Hölderlin to take up a similar position with a wine merchant's family in [[Frankfurt]], where he moved in 1797. Here, Hölderlin exerted an important influence on Hegel's thought.&lt;ref name=pinkard/&gt;{{rp|80}} While in Frankfurt, Hegel composed the essay "Fragments on Religion and Love".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www3.documenta.de/research/assets/Uploads/Hegel-Fragment-on-Love.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2013-08-09 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131008103100/http://www3.documenta.de/research/assets/Uploads/Hegel-Fragment-on-Love.pdf |archivedate=2013-10-08 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1799, he wrote another essay entitled "The Spirit of Christianity and Its Fate",&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sunypress.edu/pdf/60921.pdf The Spirit of Christianity and Its Fate"]&lt;/ref&gt; unpublished during his lifetime.

Also in 1797, the unpublished and unsigned manuscript of "[[The Oldest Systematic Program of German Idealism]]" was written. It was written in Hegel's hand, but thought to have been authored by either Hegel, Schelling, Hölderlin, or an unknown fourth person.&lt;ref name="Hammermeister"&gt;Kai Hammermeister, ''The German Aesthetic Tradition'', Cambridge University Press, 2002, p. 76.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Career years ===
==== Jena, Bamberg and Nuremberg (1801–1816) ====
In 1801, Hegel came to [[Jena]] with the encouragement of his old friend Schelling, who held the position of Extraordinary Professor at the [[University of Jena|University]] there. Hegel secured a position at the University as a ''[[Privatdozent]]'' (unsalaried lecturer) after submitting an [[inaugural dissertation]] on the orbits of the planets.&lt;ref&gt;The title of Hegel's thesis was ''Dissertatio Philosophica de Orbitis Planetarium'' (''Philosophical Dissertation on the Orbits of the Planets''); published, with a German translation by Wolgang Neuser, as ''Dissertatio Philosophica de Orbitis Planetarium / Philosophische erörterung über die Planetenbahnen'', Wiley-VCH Verlag GmbH, 1986.&lt;/ref&gt; Later in the year, Hegel's first book ''[[The Difference Between Fichte's and Schelling's Systems of Philosophy]]'' was completed. He lectured on "Logic and Metaphysics" and gave joint lectures with Schelling on an "Introduction to the Idea and Limits of True Philosophy" and held a "Philosophical Disputorium". In 1802, Schelling and Hegel founded a journal, the ''Kritische Journal der Philosophie'' (''Critical Journal of Philosophy''), to which they each contributed pieces until the collaboration was ended when Schelling left for [[Würzburg]] in 1803.

In 1805, the University promoted Hegel to the position of Extraordinary Professor (unsalaried) after he wrote a letter to the poet and minister of culture [[Johann Wolfgang Goethe]] protesting at the promotion of his philosophical adversary [[Jakob Friedrich Fries]] ahead of him.&lt;ref name=pinkard&gt;{{cite book|last=Pinkard|first=Terry|title=Hegel: A Biography|date=2000|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=0-521-49679-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|223}} Hegel attempted to enlist the help of the poet and translator [[Johann Heinrich Voß]] to obtain a post at the newly renascent [[University of Heidelberg]], but he failed; to his chagrin, Fries was later in the same year made Ordinary Professor (salaried) there.&lt;ref name=pinkard/&gt;{{rp|224–25}}

[[File:Hegel-and-Napoleon-in-Jena-1806.jpg|thumb|upright=0.9|"Hegel and Napoleon in Jena" (illustration from ''Harper's Magazine'', 1895), whose meeting became proverbial due to Hegel's notable use of ''[[Weltseele]]'' ("world-soul") in reference to Napoleon ("the world-soul on horseback", ''{{lang|de|die Weltseele zu Pferde}}'')&lt;ref&gt;Note that ''Weltseele zu Pferde'' is a shortened paraphrase of Hegel's words in the letter. The letter was not published in Hegel's time, but the expression was attributed to Hegel anecdotally, appearing in print from 1859 (L. Noack, ''Schelling und die Philosophie der Romantik'', 1859, [https://books.google.ch/books?id=7NO__b_nwrsC&amp;pg=PA153 p. 153]). It is used without attribution by [[Meyer Kayserling]] in his ''Sephardim'' (1859:103), and is apparently not recognized as a reference to Hegel by the reviewer in ''Göttingische gelehrte Anzeigen'' 2 (1861) [https://books.google.ch/books?id=4zBFAQAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA770  p. 770], who notes it disapprovingly, as one of Kayserling's "bad jokes" (''schlechte Witze''). The phrase become widely associated with Hegel later in the 19th century, e.g. G. Baur in ''Reden gehalten in der Aula der Universität Leipzig beim Rectoratswechsel am 31. October 1874'' (1874), [https://books.google.ch/books?id=INxiAAAAcAAJ&amp;pg=PA36#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false p. 36].&lt;/ref&gt;]]
With his finances drying up quickly, Hegel was now under great pressure to deliver his book, the long-promised introduction to his System. Hegel was putting the finishing touches to this book, ''[[The Phenomenology of Spirit]]'', as Napoleon engaged Prussian troops on 14 October 1806 in the [[Battle of Jena]] on a plateau outside the city. On the day before the battle, Napoleon entered the city of Jena. Hegel recounted his impressions in a letter to his friend [[Friedrich Immanuel Niethammer]]: &lt;blockquote&gt;I saw the Emperor – this world-soul [''[[Weltseele]]''] – riding out of the city on reconnaissance. It is indeed a wonderful sensation to see such an individual, who, concentrated here at a single point, astride a horse, reaches out over the world and masters it.&lt;ref&gt;''{{lang|de|den Kaiser – diese Weltseele – sah ich durch die Stadt zum Rekognoszieren hinausreiten; es ist in der Tat eine wunderbare Empfindung, ein solches Individuum zu sehen, das hier auf einen Punkt kontentriert, auf einem Pferde sitzend, über die Welt übergreift und sie beherrscht.}}''Hegel, letter of  13 October 1806  to F. I. Niethammer,  no. 74 (p. 119) in ''Briefe von und an Hegel'' ed. Hoffmeister, vol. 1 (1970), cited after H. Schnädelbach in Wolfgang Welsch, Klaus Vieweg (eds.), ''Das Interesse des Denkens: Hegel aus heutiger Sicht'', Wilhelm Fink Verlag (2003),  [https://books.google.ch/books?id=NrkPdUO5VRsC&amp;pg=PA233  p. 223]; trans. Pinkard (2000:228).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Pinkard (2000) notes that Hegel's comment to Niethammer "is all the more striking since at that point he had already composed the crucial section of the ''Phenomenology'' in which he remarked that the [[French Revolution|Revolution]] had now officially passed to another land (Germany) that would complete 'in thought' what the Revolution had only partially accomplished in practice".&lt;ref&gt;Pinkard (2000:228f).&lt;/ref&gt; Although Napoleon chose not to close down Jena as he had other universities, the city was devastated and students deserted the university in droves, making Hegel's financial prospects even worse. The following February, Hegel's landlady Christiana Burkhardt (who had been abandoned by her husband) gave birth to their son Georg Ludwig Friedrich Fischer (1807–1831).&lt;ref name=pinkard/&gt;{{rp|192}}

In March 1807, Hegel moved to [[Bamberg]], where Niethammer had declined and passed on to Hegel an offer to become editor of a newspaper, the ''{{Interlanguage link multi|Bamberger Zeitung|de}}''. Unable to find more suitable employment, Hegel reluctantly accepted. Ludwig Fischer and his mother (whom Hegel may have offered to marry following the death of her husband) stayed behind in Jena.&lt;ref name=pinkard/&gt;{{rp|238}}

In November 1808, Hegel was again through Niethammer, appointed headmaster of a ''Gymnasium'' in [[Nuremberg]], a post he held until 1816. While in Nuremberg, Hegel adapted his recently published ''Phenomenology of Spirit'' for use in the classroom. Part of his remit being to teach a class called "Introduction to Knowledge of the Universal Coherence of the Sciences", Hegel developed the idea of an encyclopedia of the philosophical sciences, falling into three parts (logic, philosophy of nature and philosophy of spirit).&lt;ref name=pinkard/&gt;{{rp|337}}

In 1811, Hegel married Marie Helena Susanna von Tucher (1791–1855), the eldest daughter of a Senator. This period saw the publication of his second major work, the ''Science of Logic'' (''Wissenschaft der Logik''; 3 vols., 1812, 1813 and 1816), and the birth of his two legitimate sons, [[Karl von Hegel|Karl Friedrich Wilhelm]] (1813–1901) and Immanuel Thomas Christian (1814–1891).

==== Heidelberg and Berlin (1816–1831) ====
Having received offers of a post from the Universities of [[University of Erlangen-Nuremberg|Erlangen]], [[Humboldt University of Berlin|Berlin]] and [[Heidelberg University|Heidelberg]], Hegel chose Heidelberg, where he moved in 1816. Soon after, his illegitimate son Ludwig Fischer (now ten years old) joined the Hegel household in April 1817, having thus far spent his childhood in an orphanage&lt;ref name=pinkard/&gt;{{rp|354–55}} as his mother had died in the meantime.&lt;ref name=pinkard/&gt;{{rp|356}}

Hegel published ''The Encyclopedia of the Philosophical Sciences in Outline'' (1817) as a summary of his philosophy for students attending his lectures at Heidelberg.

[[File:Friedrich Hegel mit Studenten Lithographie F Kugler.jpg|thumb|Hegel with his Berlin students&lt;br&gt;Sketch by Franz Kugler]]
In 1818, Hegel accepted the renewed offer of the chair of philosophy at the University of Berlin, which had remained vacant since [[Johann Gottlieb Fichte]]'s death in 1814. Here, Hegel published his ''Philosophy of Right'' (1821). Hegel devoted himself primarily to delivering his lectures; and his lecture courses on aesthetics, the philosophy of religion, the philosophy of history and the history of philosophy were published posthumously from lecture notes taken by his students. His fame spread and his lectures attracted students from all over Germany and beyond.

In 1819–1827, he made several trips to [[Weimar]] (twice), where he met Goethe, [[Brussels]], the [[Northern Netherlands]], [[Leipzig]], [[Vienna]] through [[Prague]] and [[Paris]].&lt;ref name="Siep xxii"&gt;Ludwig Siep, ''Hegel's Phenomenology of Spirit'', Cambridge University Press, 2014, p. xxi.&lt;/ref&gt;

Hegel was appointed [[Rector (academia)|Rector]] of the University in October 1829, but his term as Rector ended in September 1830. Hegel was deeply disturbed by the riots for reform in Berlin in that year. In 1831, [[Frederick William III of Prussia|Frederick William III]] decorated him with the [[Order of the Red Eagle]], 3rd Class for his service to the Prussian state.&lt;ref name="Siep xxii"/&gt; In August 1831, a [[cholera]] epidemic reached Berlin and Hegel left the city, taking up lodgings in [[Kreuzberg]]. Now in a weak state of health, Hegel seldom went out. As the new semester began in October, Hegel returned to Berlin with the (mistaken) impression that the epidemic had largely subsided. By November 14, Hegel was dead. The physicians pronounced the cause of death as cholera, but it is likely he died from a different gastrointestinal disease. He is said to have uttered the last words "And he didn't understand me" before expiring.&lt;ref&gt;Norman Davies, ''[[Europe: A History]]'', 1996, p. 687.&lt;/ref&gt; In accordance with his wishes, Hegel was buried on November 16 in the [[Dorotheenstadt cemetery]] next to Fichte and [[Karl Wilhelm Ferdinand Solger]].

Hegel's son Ludwig Fischer had died shortly before while serving with the Dutch army in [[Jakarta|Batavia]] and the news of his death never reached his father.&lt;ref name=pinkard/&gt;{{rp|548}} Early the following year, Hegel's sister Christiane committed suicide by drowning. Hegel's remaining two sons—[[Karl von Hegel|Karl]], who became a historian; and {{Interlanguage link multi|Immanuel Hegel|de|3=Immanuel Hegel|lt=Immanuel}}, who followed a theological path—lived long and safeguarded their father's ''[[Nachlaß]]'' and produced editions of his works.

== Philosophical work ==
{{Hegelianism}}

=== Freedom ===
Hegel's thinking can be understood as a constructive development within the broad tradition that includes [[Plato]] and [[Immanuel Kant]]. To this list, one could add [[Proclus]], [[Meister Eckhart]], [[Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz]], [[Plotinus]], [[Jakob Böhme]], and [[Jean-Jacques Rousseau]]. What all these thinkers share, which distinguishes them from [[materialists]] like [[Epicurus]] and [[Thomas Hobbes]] and from [[empiricists]] like [[David Hume]], is that they regard freedom or self-determination both as real and as having important [[ontology|ontological]] implications for soul or mind or divinity. This focus on freedom is what generates Plato's notion (in the ''[[Phaedo]]'', ''[[The Republic (Plato)|Republic]]'' and ''[[Timaeus (dialogue)|Timaeus]]'') of the [[Soul (spirit)|soul]] as having a higher or fuller kind of reality than inanimate objects possess. While [[Aristotle]] criticizes Plato's "Forms", he preserves Plato's cornerstones of the ontological implications for self-determination: ethical reasoning, the soul's pinnacle in the hierarchy of nature, the order of the cosmos and an assumption with reasoned arguments for a prime mover. Kant imports Plato's high esteem of individual sovereignty to his considerations of moral and noumenal freedom as well as to God. All three find common ground on the unique position of humans in the scheme of things, known by the discussed categorical differences from animals and inanimate objects.

In his discussion of "Spirit" in his ''Encyclopedia'', Hegel praises Aristotle's ''[[On the Soul]]'' as "by far the most admirable, perhaps even the sole, work of philosophical value on this topic".&lt;ref&gt;par. 378&lt;/ref&gt; In his ''[[The Phenomenology of Spirit|Phenomenology of Spirit]]'' and his ''[[Science of Logic]]'', Hegel's concern with Kantian topics such as freedom and morality and with their ontological implications is pervasive. Rather than simply rejecting Kant's dualism of freedom versus nature, Hegel aims to subsume it within "true infinity", the "Concept" (or "Notion": ''Begriff''), "Spirit" and "ethical life" in such a way that the Kantian duality is rendered intelligible, rather than remaining a brute "given".

The reason why this subsumption takes place in a series of concepts is that Hegel's method in his ''Science of Logic'' and his ''Encyclopedia'' is to begin with basic concepts like "Being" and "Nothing" and to develop these through a long sequence of elaborations, including those already mentioned. In this manner, a solution that is reached in principle in the account of "true infinity" in the ''Science of Logic'''s chapter on "Quality" is repeated in new guises at later stages, all the way to "Spirit" and "ethical life" in the third volume of the ''Encyclopedia''.

In this way, Hegel intends to defend the germ of truth in Kantian dualism against reductive or eliminative programs like those of materialism and empiricism. Like Plato, with his dualism of soul versus bodily appetites, Kant pursues the mind's ability to question its felt inclinations or appetites and to come up with a standard of "duty" (or, in Plato's case, "good") which transcends bodily restrictiveness. Hegel preserves this essential Platonic and Kantian concern in the form of infinity going beyond the finite (a process that Hegel in fact relates to "freedom" and the "ought"),&lt;ref name=miller&gt;See ''Science of Logic'', trans. Miller [Atlantic Highlands, NJ: Humanities, 1989]&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|133–136, 138}} the universal going beyond the particular (in the Concept) and Spirit going beyond Nature. Hegel renders these dualities intelligible by (ultimately) his argument in the "Quality" chapter of the "Science of Logic". The finite has to become infinite in order to achieve reality. The idea of the absolute excludes multiplicity so the subjective and objective must achieve synthesis to become whole. This is because as Hegel suggests by his introduction of the concept of "reality",&lt;ref name=miller/&gt;{{rp|111}} what determines itself—rather than depending on its relations to other things for its essential character—is more fully "real" (following the Latin etymology of "real", more "thing-like") than what does not. Finite things do not determine themselves because as "finite" things their essential character is determined by their boundaries over against other finite things, so in order to become "real" they must go beyond their finitude ("finitude is only as a transcending of itself").&lt;ref name=miller/&gt;{{rp|145}}

The result of this argument is that finite and infinite—and by extension, particular and universal, nature and freedom—do not face one another as two independent realities, but instead the latter (in each case) is the self-transcending of the former.&lt;ref name=miller/&gt;{{rp|146}} Rather than stress the distinct singularity of each factor that complements and conflicts with others—without explanation—the relationship between finite and infinite (and particular and universal and nature and freedom) becomes intelligible as a progressively developing and self-perfecting whole.

=== Progress ===
The mystical writings of [[Jakob Böhme]] had a strong effect on Hegel.&lt;ref&gt;[[Jon Mills (psychologist)|Jon Mills]], ''The Unconscious Abyss: Hegel's Anticipation of Psychoanalysis'', SUNY Press, 2002, p. 16.&lt;/ref&gt; Böhme had written that the [[Fall of Man]] was a necessary stage in the [[evolution]] of the [[universe]]. This evolution was itself the result of God's desire for complete self-awareness. Hegel was fascinated by the works of Kant, Rousseau and [[Johann Wolfgang Goethe]] and by the [[French Revolution]]. Modern philosophy, culture and society seemed to Hegel fraught with contradictions and tensions, such as those between the subject and object of knowledge, mind and nature, [[Philosophy of self|self]] and [[Other (philosophy)|Other]], freedom and authority, knowledge and faith, or the [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]] and [[Romanticism]]. Hegel's main philosophical project was to take these contradictions and tensions and interpret them as part of a comprehensive, evolving, rational unity that in different contexts he called "the absolute Idea" (''[[Science of Logic]]'', sections 1781–1783) or "absolute knowledge" (''[[Phenomenology of Spirit]]'', "(DD) Absolute Knowledge").

According to Hegel, the main characteristic of this unity was that it evolved through and manifested itself in [[contradiction]] and negation. Contradiction and negation have a dynamic quality that at every point in each domain of [[reality]]—[[consciousness]], history, philosophy, art, nature and society—leads to further development until a [[rationality|rational]] unity is reached that preserves the contradictions as phases and sub-parts by lifting them up (''[[Aufheben|Aufhebung]]'') to a higher unity. This whole is mental because it is mind that can comprehend all of these phases and sub-parts as steps in its own process of comprehension. It is rational because the same, underlying, [[logic]]al, developmental order underlies every domain of reality and is ultimately the order of self-conscious rational thought, although only in the later stages of development does it come to full self-consciousness. The rational, self-conscious [[wikt:whole|whole]] is not a thing or [[being]] that lies outside of other existing things or minds. Rather, it comes to completion only in the philosophical comprehension of individual existing human minds who through their own understanding bring this developmental process to an understanding of itself. Hegel's thought is revolutionary to the extent that it is a philosophy of absolute negation—as long as absolute negation is at the center, systematization remains open, and makes it possible for human beings to become subjects.&lt;ref name="Schroeder2000"&gt;{{cite book|author=Steven Schroeder|title=Between Freedom and Necessity: An Essay on the Place of Value|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=JfT6aQvkVfAC&amp;pg=PA104|accessdate=2012-12-17|year=2000|publisher=Rodopi|isbn=978-90-420-1302-5|page=104}}&lt;/ref&gt;

"Mind" and "Spirit" are the common English translations of Hegel's use of the German "[[Geist]]". Some{{Who|date=December 2012}} have argued that either of these terms overly "psychologize" Hegel,{{citation needed|date=February 2007}} implying a kind of disembodied, solipsistic consciousness like [[ghost]] or "soul". Geist combines the meaning of spirit—as in god, ghost, or mind—with an intentional force. In Hegel's early philosophy of nature (draft manuscripts written during his time at the University of Jena), Hegel's notion of "Geist" was tightly bound to the notion of "[[Aether (classical element)|Aether]]", from which Hegel also derived the concepts of [[space]] and [[time]], but in his later works (after Jena) he did not explicitly use his old notion of "Aether" anymore.&lt;ref&gt;Stefan Gruner: "Hegel's Aether Doctrine", [[VDM Publishing|VDM Publ]]., 2010, {{ISBN|978-3-639-28451-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Central to Hegel's [[Conception (idea)|conception]] of [[knowledge]] and mind (and therefore also of reality) was the notion of [[Identity (philosophy)|identity]] in [[Subtraction|difference]]—that is, that mind [[Externalization|externalizes]] itself in various forms and [[object (philosophy)|object]]s that stand outside of it or opposed to it; and that through recognizing itself in them, is "with itself" in these external manifestations so that they are at one and the same time mind and other-than-mind. This notion of identity in difference, which is intimately bound up with his conception of contradiction and negativity, is a principal feature differentiating Hegel's thought from that of other philosophers.{{Citation needed|date=June 2016}}

=== Civil society ===
{{see also|Civil society}}
Hegel made the distinction between civil society and state in his ''[[Elements of the Philosophy of Right]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.marxists.org/reference/archive/hegel/works/pr/preface.htm|title=Hegel's Philosophy of Right: Preface|first=|last=Hegel, G. W. F.|website=www.marxists.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; In this work, civil society (Hegel used the term "''bürgerliche Gesellschaft''" though it is now referred to as ''Zivilgesellschaft'' in German to emphasize a more inclusive community) was a stage in the [[dialectical|dialectical relationship]] that occurs between Hegel's perceived opposites, the macro-community of the [[State (polity)|state]] and the micro-community of the family.&lt;ref&gt;Pelczynski, A.Z.; 1984; 'The Significance of Hegel's separation of the state and civil society' pp1-13 in Pelczynski, A.Z. (ed.); 1984; ''The State and Civil Society''; Cambridge University Press&lt;/ref&gt; Broadly speaking, the term was split, like Hegel's followers, to the [[political left]] and [[political right|right]]. On the left, it became the foundation for [[Karl Marx]]'s civil society as an [[base and superstructure|economic base]];&lt;ref name="glob"&gt;{{cite journal | last = Zaleski | first = Pawel | authorlink = | title = Tocqueville on Civilian Society. A Romantic Vision of the Dichotomic Structure of Social Reality | journal = Archiv für Begriffsgeschichte | volume = 50 | issue = | pages = | publisher = Felix Meiner Verlag | location = | year = 2008 | url = | doi = | id = | accessdate = }}&lt;/ref&gt; to the right, it became a description for all non-state (and the state is the peak of the objective spirit) aspects of society, including culture, society and politics. This liberal distinction between [[political society]] and [[civil society]] was followed by [[Alexis de Tocqueville]].&lt;ref name="glob" /&gt; In fact, Hegel's distinctions as to what he meant by civil society are often unclear. For example, while it seems to be the case that he felt that a civil society such as the German society in which he lived was an inevitable movement of the dialectic, he made way for the crushing of other types of "lesser" and not fully realized types of civil society as these societies were not fully conscious or aware—as it were—as to the lack of progress in their societies. Thus, it was perfectly legitimate in the eyes of Hegel for a conqueror such as Napoleon to come along and destroy that which was not fully realized.

=== State ===
Hegel's State is the final culmination of the embodiment of freedom or right (''Rechte'') in the ''[[Elements of the Philosophy of Right]].'' The State subsumes family and civil society and fulfills them. All three together are called "ethical life" (''[[Sittlichkeit]]''). The State involves three "[[wikt:moment#Noun|moments]]". In a Hegelian State, citizens both know their place and choose their place. They both know their obligations and choose to fulfill their obligations. An individual's "supreme duty is to be a member of the state" (''Elements of the Philosophy of Right'', section 258). The individual has "substantial freedom in the state". The State is "objective spirit" so "it is only through being a member of the state that the individual himself has objectivity, truth, and ethical life" (section 258). Furthermore, every member both loves the State with genuine patriotism, but has transcended mere "team spirit" by reflectively endorsing their citizenship. Members of a Hegelian State are happy even to sacrifice their lives for the State.

=== Heraclitus ===
According to Hegel, "[[Heraclitus]] is the one who first declared the nature of the infinite and first grasped nature as in itself infinite, that is, its essence as process. The origin of philosophy is to be dated from Heraclitus. His is the persistent Idea that is the same in all philosophers up to the present day, as it was the Idea of Plato and Aristotle".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Hegel, G. W. F.|title=Vorlesungen über die Geschichte der Philosophie|year=1979|pages=336–337|url=http://www.zeno.org/Philosophie/M/Hegel,+Georg+Wilhelm+Friedrich/Vorlesungen+%C3%BCber+die+Geschichte+der+Philosophie/Erster+Teil%3A+Griechische+Philosophie/Erster+Abschnitt.+Von+Thales+bis+Aristoteles/Erstes+Kapitel.+Von+Thales+bis+Anaxagoras/D.+Philosophie+des+Heraklit | accessdate=2008-07-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; For Hegel, Heraclitus's great achievements were to have understood the nature of the infinite, which for Hegel includes understanding the inherent contradictoriness and negativity of reality; and to have grasped that reality is becoming or process and that "being" and "nothingness" are mere empty abstractions. According to Hegel, Heraclitus's "obscurity" comes from his being a true (in Hegel's terms "speculative") philosopher who grasped the ultimate philosophical truth and therefore expressed himself in a way that goes beyond the abstract and limited nature of common sense and is difficult to grasp by those who operate within common sense. Hegel asserted that in Heraclitus he had an antecedent for his logic: "[...] there is no proposition of Heraclitus which I have not adopted in my logic".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | first=Justus | last=Hartnack |others=Lars Aagaard-Mogensen (trans.) | title=An Introduction to Hegel's Logic | year=1998 | publisher=Hackett Publishing | isbn=0-87220-424-3| pages=16–17}} Hartnack quotes Hegel, ''Lectures on the History of Philosophy'', Volume I.&lt;/ref&gt;

Hegel cites a number of fragments of Heraclitus in his ''Lectures on the History of Philosophy''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | author=Hegel, G. W. F. | title=Vorlesungen über die Geschichte der Philosophie | year=1979 | pages=319–343 | url=http://www.zeno.org/Philosophie/M/Hegel,+Georg+Wilhelm+Friedrich/Vorlesungen+%C3%BCber+die+Geschichte+der+Philosophie/Erster+Teil%3A+Griechische+Philosophie/Erster+Abschnitt.+Von+Thales+bis+Aristoteles/Erstes+Kapitel.+Von+Thales+bis+Anaxagoras/D.+Philosophie+des+Heraklit | accessdate=2008-07-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; One to which he attributes great significance is the fragment he translates as "Being is not more than Non-being", which he interprets to mean the following: &lt;blockquote&gt;''Sein und Nichts sei dasselbe''&lt;br&gt;Being and non-being are the same.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Heraclitus does not form any abstract nouns from his ordinary use of "to be" and "to become" and in that fragment seems to be opposing any identity A to any other identity B, C and so on, which is not-A. However, Hegel interprets not-A as not existing at all, not nothing at all, which cannot be conceived, but indeterminate or "pure" [[being]] without [[particular]]ity or specificity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | first=Frederick Charles | last=Copleston | pages=Chapter X | year=2003 | publisher=Continuum International Publishing Group | isbn=0-8264-6901-9 | nopp=true | title=A History of Philosophy: Volume 7: 18th and 19th century German philosophy}}&lt;/ref&gt; Pure being and pure non-being or nothingness are for Hegel pure abstractions from the reality of becoming and this is also how he interprets Heraclitus. This interpretation of Heraclitus cannot be ruled out, but even if present is not the main gist of his thought.

For Hegel, the inner movement of reality is the process of God thinking as manifested in the evolution of the universe of nature and thought; that is, Hegel argued that when fully and properly understood, [[reality]] is being [[Idealism|thought]] by God as manifested in a person's comprehension of this process in and through philosophy. Since human thought is the image and fulfillment of God's thought, God is not [[Ineffability|ineffable]] (so incomprehensible as to be unutterable), but can be understood by an analysis of thought and reality. Just as humans continually correct their concepts of reality through a [[dialectic|dialectical process]], so God himself becomes more fully manifested through the dialectical process of becoming.

For his god, Hegel does not take the logos of Heraclitus but refers rather to the [[nous]] of [[Anaxagoras]], although he may well have regarded them the same as he continues to refer to god's plan, which is identical to God. Whatever the nous thinks at any time is actual [[Substance theory|substance]] and is identical to limited being, but more remains to be thought in the substrate of non-being, which is identical to pure or unlimited thought.

The universe as becoming is therefore a combination of being and non-being. The particular is never complete in itself, but to find completion is continually transformed into more comprehensive, complex, self-relating particulars. The essential nature of being-for-itself is that it is free "in itself;" that is, it does not depend on anything else such as matter for its being. The limitations represent fetters, which it must constantly be casting off as it becomes freer and more self-determining.&lt;ref&gt;The notable Introduction to ''Philosophy of History'' expresses the historical aspects of the dialectic.&lt;/ref&gt;

Although Hegel began his philosophizing with commentary on the Christian religion and often expresses the view that he is a Christian, his ideas of God are not acceptable to some Christians even though he has had a major influence on 19th- and 20th-century theology.

=== Religion ===
As a graduate of a Protestant seminary, Hegel's theological concerns were reflected in many of his writings and lectures.&lt;ref&gt;"[T]he task that touches the interest of philosophy most nearly at the present moment: to put God back at the peak of philosophy, absolutely prior to all else as the one and only ground of everything." (Hegel, "How the Ordinary Human Understanding Takes Philosophy as displayed in the works of Mr. Krug", ''Kritisches Journal der Philosophie'', I, no. 1, 1802, pages&amp;nbsp;91–115)&lt;/ref&gt; Hegel's thoughts on the person of [[Jesus|Jesus Christ]] stood out from the theologies of the Enlightenment. In his posthumously published ''[[Lectures on the Philosophy of Religion]], Part 3'', Hegel is shown as being particularly interested with the demonstrations of God's existence and the ontological proof.&lt;ref&gt;Jon Bartley Stewart. 2008. ''[[Johan Ludvig Heiberg (poet)|Johan Ludvig Heiberg]]: Philosopher, Littérateur, Dramaturge, and Political Thinker.'' Museum Tusculanum Press. p. 100&lt;/ref&gt; He espouses that "God is not an abstraction but a concrete God&amp;nbsp;[...] God, considered in terms of his eternal Idea, has to generate the Son, has to distinguish himself from himself; he is the process of differentiating, namely, love and Spirit". This means that Jesus as the Son of God is posited by God over against himself as other. Hegel sees both a relational unity and a metaphysical unity between Jesus and God the Father. To Hegel, Jesus is both divine and human. Hegel further attests that God (as Jesus) not only died, but "[...]&amp;nbsp;rather, a reversal takes place: God, that is to say, maintains himself in the process, and the latter is only the death of death. God rises again to life, and thus things are reversed".

The philosopher [[Walter Kaufmann (philosopher)|Walter Kaufmann]] has argued that there was great stress on the sharp criticisms of traditional Christianity appearing in Hegel's so-called early theological writings. Kaufmann admits that Hegel treated many distinctively Christian themes and "sometimes could not resist equating" his conception of spirit (Geist) "with God, instead of saying clearly: in God I do not believe; spirit suffices me".&lt;ref&gt;Walter Kaufmann, ''Hegel: Reinterpretation, Texts, and Commentary'', Garden City, New York: Doubleday &amp; Company, 1965, pp. 276–77&lt;/ref&gt; Kaufmann also points out that Hegel's references to God or to the divine—and also to spirit—drew on classical Greek as well as Christian connotations of the terms. Kaufmann goes on:

&lt;blockquote&gt;In addition to his beloved Greeks, Hegel saw before him the example of Spinoza and, in his own time, the poetry of Goethe, Schiller, and Hölderlin, who also liked to speak of gods and the divine. So he, too, sometimes spoke of God and, more often, of the divine; and because he occasionally took pleasure in insisting that he was really closer to this or that Christian tradition than some of the theologians of his time, he has sometimes been understood to have been a Christian.&lt;ref&gt;[[Walter Kaufmann (philosopher)|Walter Kaufmann]], ''Hegel: Reinterpretation, Texts, and Commentary'', Garden City, New York: Doubleday &amp; Company, 1965, p. 277&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

According to Hegel himself, his philosophy was consistent with Christianity.&lt;ref&gt;Jon Bartley Stewart. 2008. Johan Ludvig Heiberg: Philosopher, Littérateur, Dramaturge, and Political Thinker. Museum Tusculanum Press. p. 100&lt;/ref&gt; This led Hegelian philosopher, jurist and politician {{Interlanguage link multi|Carl Friedrich Göschel|de}} (1784–1861) to write a treatise demonstrating the consistency of Hegel's philosophy with the Christian doctrine of the immortality of the human soul. Göschel's book on this subject was titled ''Von den Beweisen für die Unsterblichkeit der menschlichen Seele im Lichte der spekulativen Philosophie: eine Ostergabe'' (Berlin: Verlag von Duncker und Humblot, 1835).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://reader.digitale-sammlungen.de/de/fs1/object/display/bsb10043317_00005.html|title=MDZ-Reader  - Band  - Von den Beweisen für die Unsterblichkeit der menschlichen Seele im Lichte der spekulativen Philosophie / Göschel, Carl Friedrich|website=reader.digitale-sammlungen.de}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;In the 1870s and 1880s, Rev. T. R. Vickroy and Susan E. Blow - who were both minor associates of the St. Louis Hegelians - independently of each other translated various chapters from Göschel's book into English, and had their translations published in ''The Journal of Speculative Philosophy''. ''The Journal of Speculative Philosophy'' (in print from 1867-1893) was the official journal of the St. Louis Philosophical Society. The St. Louis Philosophical Society - the organization which served as the hub of the St. Louis Hegelians - had been co-founded in January 1866 by 2 disciples of Hegel in America, William Torrey Harris (1835-1909) and [[Henry Conrad Brokmeyer]] (1826-1906). Rev. Thomas Rhys Vickroy (December 27, 1833 - April 19, 1904), a minister of the Methodist Episcopal Church, had been the first president (1866-1871) of Lebanon Valley College in Annville, Lebanon County, Pennsylvania. While President at Lebanon Valley College, Vickroy also held various professorships there. For example, one year he was Professor of Philosophy and the Greek Language and Literature, and another year he was Professor of Belles-Lettres and Philosophy. Susan Elizabeth Blow (June 7, 1843 - March 27, 1916) was an educator who in 1873 opened the first successful public kindergarten in the U. S. - in the Des Peres School, in the Carondelet neighborhood of St. Louis, Missouri.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Jon Bartley Stewart. 2008. ''Johan Ludvig Heiberg: Philosopher, Littérateur, Dramaturge, and Political Thinker''. Museum Tusculanum Press. p. 105&lt;/ref&gt;

Hegel seemed to have an ambivalent relationship with [[Magic (supernatural)|magic]], [[myth]] and [[Paganism]]. He formulates an early philosophical example of a [[disenchantment]] narrative, arguing that Judaism was responsible both for realizing the existence of ''Geist'' and, by extension, for separating nature from ideas of spiritual and magical forces and challenging [[polytheism]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | last = Josephson-Storm | first = Jason | title = The Myth of Disenchantment: Magic, Modernity, and the Birth of the Human Sciences | location = Chicago | publisher = University of Chicago Press | date = 2017 |page = 85-6 | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=xZ5yDgAAQBAJ | isbn = 0-226-40336-X }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, Hegel's manuscript "[[The Oldest Systematic Program of German Idealism]]" suggests that Hegel was concerned about the perceived decline in myth and enchantment in his age, and that he therefore called for a "new myth" to fill the cultural vacuum.&lt;ref&gt;Josephson-Storm (2017), p. 85-6.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Works ==
Hegel published four works during his lifetime:&lt;br&gt;
(1) ''[[The Phenomenology of Spirit]]'' (or ''The Phenomenology of Mind''), his account of the evolution of consciousness from sense-perception to absolute knowledge, published in 1807.

(2) ''[[Science of Logic]]'', the logical and [[metaphysics|metaphysical]] core of his philosophy, in three volumes (1812, 1813 and 1816, respectively), with a revised first volume published in 1831.

(3) ''[[Encyclopedia of the Philosophical Sciences]]'', a summary of his entire philosophical system, which was originally published in 1816 and revised in 1827 and 1830.

(4) ''[[Elements of the Philosophy of Right]]'', his political philosophy, published in 1820.

During the last ten years of his life, Hegel did not publish another book, but thoroughly revised the ''Encyclopedia'' (second edition, 1827; third, 1830).&lt;ref&gt;W. Kaufmann (1980), ''Discovery of the Mind 1: Goethe, Kant and Hegel'', p. 203&lt;/ref&gt; In his political philosophy, he criticized [[Karl Ludwig von Haller]]'s reactionary work, which claimed that laws were not necessary. He also published some articles early in his career and during his Berlin period. A number of other works on the [[philosophy of history]], [[Philosophy of religion|religion]], [[aesthetics]] and the [[history of philosophy]] were compiled from the lecture notes of his students and published posthumously.

{{see also|Hegelianism}}
There are views of Hegel's thought as a representation of the summit of early 19th-century Germany's movement of philosophical [[idealism]]. It would come to have a profound impact on many future philosophical schools, including schools that opposed Hegel's specific [[dialectical idealism]], such as [[existentialism]], the [[historical materialism]] of Marx, [[historism]] and [[British idealism|British Idealism]].

Hegel's influence was immense both within philosophy and in the other sciences. Throughout the 19th century many chairs of philosophy around Europe were held by Hegelians and [[Søren Kierkegaard]], [[Ludwig Feuerbach]], [[Karl Marx]] and [[Friedrich Engels]]—among many others—were all deeply influenced by, but also strongly opposed to many of the central themes of Hegel's philosophy. Scholars continue to find and point out Hegelian influences and approaches in a wide range of theoretical and/or learned works, such as [[Carl von Clausewitz]]'s ''magnum opus'' on strategic thought, ''[[On War]]'' (1831).&lt;ref&gt;Cormier, Youri. [http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/07075332.2013.859166?tab=permissions#.U9etAfldXGA "Hegel and Clausewitz: Convergence on Method, Divergence on Ethics"], ''International History Review'', Volume 36, Issue 3, 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; After less than a generation, Hegel's philosophy was suppressed and even banned by the [[Prussia]]n [[right-wing]] and was firmly rejected by the [[left-wing]] in multiple official writings.

After the period of [[Bruno Bauer]], Hegel's influence did not make itself felt again until the philosophy of British Idealism and the 20th-century Hegelian [[Western Marxism]] that began with [[György Lukács]]. The more recent movement of [[communitarianism]] has a strong Hegelian influence.

=== Reading Hegel ===
Some of Hegel's writing was intended for those with advanced knowledge of philosophy, although his ''Encyclopedia'' was intended as a textbook in a [[university]] [[course (education)|course]]. Nevertheless, Hegel assumes that his readers are well-versed in [[Western philosophy]]. Especially crucial are [[Aristotle]], [[Immanuel Kant]] and Kant's immediate successors, most prominently [[Johann Gottlieb Fichte]] and [[Friedrich Wilhelm Joseph Schelling]]. Those without this background would be well-advised to begin with one of the many general introductions to his thought. As is always the case, difficulties are magnified for those reading him in translation. In fact, Hegel himself argues in his ''Science of Logic'' that the German language was particularly conducive to philosophical thought.&lt;ref&gt;Hegel, G.W.F. ''Science of Logic''. trans. George di Giovanni. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press. 2010. p.12&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Walter Kaufmann, the basic idea of Hegel's works, especially the ''Phenomenology of Spirit'', is that a philosopher should not "confine him or herself to views that have been held but penetrate these to the human reality they reflect". In other words, it is not enough to consider propositions, or even the content of consciousness; "it is worthwhile to ask in every instance what kind of spirit would entertain such propositions, hold such views, and have such a consciousness. Every outlook in other words, is to be studied not merely as an academic possibility but as an existential reality".&lt;ref&gt;W. Kaufmann (1966), ''Hegel: A Reinterpretation'', Anchor, p. 115&lt;/ref&gt; Kaufmann has argued that as unlikely as it may sound, it is not the case that Hegel was unable to write clearly, but that Hegel felt that "he must and should not write in the way in which he was gifted".&lt;ref&gt;W. Kaufmann, 1966, ''Hegel: A Reinterpretation'', p. 99&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Left and right Hegelianism ===
Some historians have spoken of Hegel's influence as represented by two opposing camps. The [[Right Hegelians]], the allegedly direct disciples of Hegel at the [[Humboldt University of Berlin|Friedrich-Wilhelms-Universität]], advocated a [[Protestant]] orthodoxy and the [[political conservatism]] of the post-[[Napoleon I of France|Napoleon]] Restoration period. The [[Young Hegelians|Left Hegelians]], also known as the Young Hegelians, interpreted Hegel in a [[revolutionary]] sense, leading to an advocation of [[atheism]] in religion and [[liberal democracy]] in politics.

In more recent studies, this paradigm has been questioned.&lt;ref&gt;[[Karl Löwith]], ''From Hegel to Nietzsche: The Revolution in Nineteenth-Century Thought'', translated by David E. Green, New York: Columbia University Press, 1964.&lt;/ref&gt; No Hegelians of the period ever referred to themselves as "Right Hegelians", which was a term of insult originated by [[David Strauss]], a self-styled Left Hegelian. Critiques of Hegel offered from the Left Hegelians radically diverted Hegel's thinking into new directions and eventually came to form a disproportionately large part of the literature on and about Hegel.{{Citation needed|date=August 2009}}

The Left Hegelians also influenced Marxism, which inspired global movements, encompassing the [[Russian Revolution (1917)|Russian Revolution]], the [[Chinese Revolution (1949)|Chinese Revolution]] and myriad revolutionary practices up until the present moment.{{citation needed|date=November 2017}}

20th-century interpretations of Hegel were mostly shaped by [[British idealism]], [[logical positivism]], [[Marxism]] and [[Fascism]]. According to [[Benedetto Croce]], the [[Italian Fascist]] [[Giovanni Gentile]] "holds the honor of having been the most rigorous neo-Hegelian in the entire history of Western philosophy and the dishonor of having been the official philosopher of Fascism in Italy".&lt;ref&gt;[[Benedetto Croce]], ''Guide to Aesthetics'', Translated by Patrick Romanell, "Translator's Introduction", The Library of Liberal Arts, The Bobbs–Merrill Co., Inc., 1965&lt;/ref&gt; However, since the fall of the Soviet Union a new wave of Hegel scholarship arose in the West without the preconceptions of the prior schools of thought. {{Interlanguage link multi|Walter Jaeschke|de}} and [[Otto Pöggeler]] in Germany as well as Peter Hodgson and [[Howard Kainz]] in the United States are notable for their recent contributions to post-Soviet Union thinking about Hegel.

=== Triads ===
{{main|Thesis, antithesis, synthesis}}
In previous modern accounts of Hegelianism (to undergraduate classes, for example), especially those formed prior to the Hegel renaissance, Hegel's [[dialectic]] was most often characterized as a three-step process, "[[thesis, antithesis, synthesis]]"; namely, that a "thesis" (e.g. the [[French Revolution]]) would cause the creation of its "antithesis" (e.g. the [[Reign of Terror]] that followed) and would eventually result in a "synthesis" (e.g. the [[constitutional state]] of free citizens). However, Hegel used this classification only once and he attributed the terminology to Kant. The terminology was largely developed earlier by Fichte. It was spread by [[Heinrich Moritz Chalybäus]] in accounts of Hegelian philosophy and since then the terms have been used as descriptive of this type of framework.

The "thesis–antithesis–synthesis" approach gives the sense that things or ideas are contradicted or opposed by things that come from outside them. To the contrary, the fundamental notion of Hegel's dialectic is that things or ideas have internal contradictions. From Hegel's point of view, analysis or comprehension of a thing or idea reveals that underneath its apparently simple identity or unity is an underlying inner contradiction. This contradiction leads to the dissolution of the thing or idea in the simple form in which it presented itself and to a higher-level, more complex thing or idea that more adequately incorporates the contradiction. The triadic form that appears in many places in Hegel (e.g. being–nothingness–becoming, immediate–mediate–concrete and abstract–negative–concrete) is about this movement from inner contradiction to higher-level integration or unification.

For Hegel, reason is but "speculative", not "dialectical".&lt;ref&gt;''Hegel and Language'', edited by Jere O'Neill Surber. [https://books.google.com/books?id=HFpQHr07IAkC&amp;pg=PA238 p. 238].&lt;/ref&gt; Believing that the traditional description of Hegel's philosophy in terms of thesis–antithesis–synthesis was mistaken, a few scholars like [[Raya Dunayevskaya]] have attempted to discard the triadic approach altogether. According to their argument, although Hegel refers to "the two elemental considerations: first, the idea of freedom as the absolute and final aim; secondly, the means for realising it, i.e. the subjective side of knowledge and will, with its life, movement, and activity" (thesis and antithesis), he does not use "synthesis", but instead speaks of the "Whole": "We then recognised the State as the moral Whole and the Reality of Freedom, and consequently as the objective unity of these two elements". Furthermore, in Hegel's language the "dialectical" aspect or "moment" of thought and reality, by which things or thoughts turn into their opposites or have their inner contradictions brought to the surface, what he called ''[[Aufheben|Aufhebung]]'', is only preliminary to the "speculative" (and not "synthesizing") aspect or "moment", which grasps the unity of these opposites or contradiction.

It is widely admitted today that the old-fashioned description of Hegel's philosophy in terms of thesis–antithesis–synthesis is inaccurate. Nevertheless, such is the persistence of this misnomer that the model and terminology survive in a number of scholarly works.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Gustav E. Mueller|editor=Jon Stewart|title=The Hegel Myths and Legends|url=|accessdate=|year=1996|publisher=Northwestern University Press|isbn=0-8101-1301-5|page=301}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Renaissance ===
In the last half of the 20th century, Hegel's philosophy underwent a major renaissance. This was due to (a) the rediscovery and re-evaluation of Hegel as a possible philosophical progenitor of Marxism by philosophically oriented Marxists; (b) a resurgence of the historical perspective that Hegel brought to everything; and (c) an increasing recognition of the importance of his [[dialectical method]]. [[György Lukács]]' ''[[History and Class Consciousness]]'' (1923) helped to reintroduce Hegel into the Marxist canon. This sparked a renewed interest in Hegel reflected in the work of [[Herbert Marcuse]], [[Theodor W. Adorno]], [[Ernst Bloch]], [[Raya Dunayevskaya]], [[Alexandre Kojève]] and [[Gotthard Günther]] among others. In ''[[Reason and Revolution]]'' (1941), [[Herbert Marcuse]] made the case for Hegel as a revolutionary and criticized [[Leonard Trelawny Hobhouse]]'s thesis that Hegel was a totalitarian.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | first=Paul | last=Robinson | title=The Freudian Left: Wilhelm Reich, Geza Roheim, Herbert Marcuse | year=1990 | publisher=Cornell University Press | isbn=0-87220-424-3| page=156}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Hegel renaissance also highlighted the significance of Hegel's early works, i.e. those written before ''[[The Phenomenology of Spirit]]''. The direct and indirect influence of Kojève's lectures and writings (on ''The Phenomenology of Spirit'' in particular) mean that it is not possible to understand most French philosophers from [[Jean-Paul Sartre]] to [[Jacques Derrida]] without understanding Hegel.&lt;ref&gt;French philosopher [[Vincent Descombes]] introduced the term "post-Kojèvian discourse" to designate the period of French philosophy after the 1930s (Vincent Descombes, ''Modern French Philosophy'', Cambridge University Press, 1980, pp. 158–9).&lt;/ref&gt; American [[neoconservative]] [[political science|political theorist]] [[Francis Fukuyama]]'s controversial book ''[[The End of History and the Last Man]]'' (1992) was heavily influenced by Kojève.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | first=Howard | last=Williams |author2=David Sullivan |author3=Gwynn Matthews  | title=Francis Fukuyama and the End of History | year=1997 | publisher=University of Wales Press | isbn=0-7083-1428-7 | pages=70–71}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The Swiss theologian [[Hans Küng]] has also advanced contemporary scholarship in Hegel studies.{{citation needed|date=May 2017}}

Beginning in the 1960s, Anglo-American Hegel scholarship has attempted to challenge the traditional interpretation of Hegel as offering a metaphysical system: this has also been the approach of [[Z. A. Pelczynski]] and [[Shlomo Avineri]]. This view, sometimes referred to as the "non-metaphysical option", has had a decided influence on many major English language studies of Hegel in the past forty years.

Late 20th-century literature in Western [[Theology]] that is friendly to Hegel includes works by such writers as [[Walter Kaufmann (philosopher)|Walter Kaufmann]] (1966), [[Dale M. Schlitt]] (1984), [[Theodore Geraets]] (1985), [[Philip M. Merklinger]] (1991), [[Stephen Rocker]] (1995) and [[Cyril O'Regan]] (1995).

Two prominent American philosophers, [[John McDowell]] and [[Robert Brandom]] (sometimes referred to as the "[[University of Pittsburgh|Pittsburgh]] Hegelians"), have produced philosophical works exhibiting a marked Hegelian influence. Each is avowedly influenced by the late [[Wilfred Sellars]], also of Pittsburgh, who referred to his seminal work ''Empiricism and the Philosophy of Mind'' (1956) as a series of "incipient ''Méditations Hegeliennes''" (in homage to [[Edmund Husserl]]'s 1931 work, ''[[Cartesian Meditations|Méditations cartésiennes]]'').

Beginning in the 1990s after the fall of the Soviet Union, a fresh reading of Hegel took place in the West. For these scholars, fairly well represented by the Hegel Society of America and in cooperation with German scholars such as Otto Pöggeler and Walter Jaeschke, Hegel's works should be read without preconceptions. Marx plays little-to-no role in these new readings. Some American philosophers associated with this movement include [[Lawrence Stepelevich]], [[Rudolf Siebert]], Richard Dien Winfield and [[Theodore Geraets]].{{citation needed|date=May 2017}}

=== Criticism ===
Criticism of Hegel has been widespread in the 19th and the 20th centuries. A diverse range of individuals including [[Arthur Schopenhauer]], [[Karl Marx]], [[Søren Kierkegaard]], [[Friedrich Nietzsche]], [[Bertrand Russell]], [[G. E. Moore]], [[Eric Voegelin]] and [[A. J. Ayer]] have challenged Hegelian philosophy from a variety of perspectives. Among the first to take a critical view of Hegel's system was the 19th-century German group known as the [[Young Hegelians]], which included Feuerbach, Marx, Engels and their followers. In Britain, the Hegelian [[British idealism]] school (members of which included [[Francis Herbert Bradley]], [[Bernard Bosanquet (philosopher)|Bernard Bosanquet]] and in the United States [[Josiah Royce]]) was challenged and rejected by [[analytic philosophy|analytic]] philosophers Moore and Russell. In particular, Russell considered "almost all" of Hegel's doctrines to be false.&lt;ref&gt;B. Russell, ''History of Western Philosophy'', chapter 22, paragraph 1, p. 701.&lt;/ref&gt; Regarding Hegel's interpretation of history, Russell commented: "Like other historical theories, it required, if it was to be made plausible, some distortion of facts and considerable ignorance".&lt;ref&gt;Russell, 735.&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Logical positivism|Logical positivists]] such as Ayer and the [[Vienna Circle]] criticized both Hegelian philosophy and its supporters, such as Bradley.

Hegel's contemporary Schopenhauer was particularly critical and wrote of Hegel's philosophy as "a pseudo-philosophy paralyzing all mental powers, stifling all real thinking".&lt;ref&gt;On the Basis of Morality.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1820, Schopenhauer became a lecturer at the [[Humboldt University of Berlin|University of Berlin]] and he scheduled his lectures to coincide with those of Hegel, whom Schopenhauer had also described as a "clumsy charlatan".&lt;ref&gt;Schopenhauer, Arthur. Author's preface to "On The Fourfold Root of the Principle of sufficient reason. Page 1. [[:s:On the Fourfold Root of the Principle of Sufficient Reason|On the Fourfold Root of the Principle of Sufficient Reason]]&lt;/ref&gt; However, only five students ended up attending Schopenhauer's lectures so he dropped out of [[academia]]. Kierkegaard criticized Hegel's "absolute knowledge" unity.&lt;ref&gt;Søren Kierkegaard Concluding Unscientific Postscriptt&lt;/ref&gt; The physicist and philosopher [[Ludwig Boltzmann]] also criticized the obscure complexity of Hegel's works, referring to Hegel's writing as an "unclear thoughtless flow of words".&lt;ref&gt;Ludwig Boltzmann, ''Theoretical physics and philosophical problems: Selected writings'', p. 155, [[D. Reidel]], 1974, {{ISBN|90-277-0250-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a similar vein, Robert Pippin notes that some view Hegel as having "the ugliest prose style in the history of the German language".&lt;ref&gt;Robert B. Pippin, ''Hegel's Idealism: The Satisfaction of Self-Consciousness (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1989), 5&lt;/ref&gt; Russell wrote in ''[[A History of Western Philosophy]]'' (1945) that Hegel was "the hardest to understand of all the great philosophers".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Russell|first=Bertrand|title=A History of Western Philosophy|date=1972|page=730}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Karl Popper]] wrote that "there is so much philosophical writing (especially in the Hegelian school) which may justly be criticized as meaningless verbiage".&lt;ref&gt;Karl Popper, ''Conjectures and Refutations: The Growth of Scientific Knowledge'' (New York: Routledge, 1963), 94.&lt;/ref&gt; Popper also makes the claim in the second volume of ''[[The Open Society and Its Enemies]]'' (1945) that Hegel's system formed a thinly veiled justification for the [[Absolute monarchy|absolute rule]] of [[Frederick William III of Prussia|Frederick William III]] and that Hegel's idea of the ultimate goal of history was to reach a [[sovereign state|state]] approximating that of 1830s [[Prussia]]. Popper further proposed that Hegel's philosophy served not only as an inspiration for [[communism|communist]] and [[fascism|fascist]] totalitarian governments of the 20th century, whose dialectics allow for any belief to be construed as rational simply if it could be said to exist. Kaufmann and [[Shlomo Avineri]] have criticized Popper's theories about Hegel.&lt;ref&gt;See for instance Walter Kaufmann (1959), [http://www.marxists.org/reference/subject/philosophy/works/us/kaufmann.htm ''The Hegel Myth and Its Method'']&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Isaiah Berlin]] listed Hegel as one of the six architects of modern [[authoritarianism]] who undermined [[liberal democracy]], along with Rousseau, [[Claude Adrien Helvétius]], Fichte, [[Claude Henri de Rouvroy, comte de Saint-Simon|Saint-Simon]] and [[Joseph de Maistre]].&lt;ref&gt;Berlin, Isaiah, ''Freedom and Betrayal: Six Enemies of Human Liberty'' (Princeton University Press, 2003)&lt;/ref&gt;

Voegelin argued that Hegel should be understood not as a philosopher, but as a "sorcerer", i.e. as a [[mysticism|mystic]] and [[Hermeticism|hermetic]] thinker.&lt;ref&gt;Voegelin, Eric (1972). "On Hegel—A Study in Sorcery", in  J. T. Fraser, F. Haber &amp; G. Muller (eds.), ''The Study of Time''. Springer-Verlag. 418--451 (1972)&lt;/ref&gt; This concept of Hegel as a hermetic thinker was elaborated by Glenn Alexander Magee,&lt;ref&gt;Magee, Glenn Alexander (2001), ''Hegel and the Hermetic Tradition'', Ithaca: Cornell University Press&lt;/ref&gt; who argued that interpreting Hegel's body of work as an expression of mysticism and hermetic ideas leads to a more accurate understanding of Hegel.&lt;ref&gt;"I do not argue that merely that we ''can'' understand Hegel as a Hermetic thinker, just as we can understand him as a German or a Swabian or an idealist thinker. Instead, I argue that we ''must'' understand Hegel as a Hermetic thinker, if we are to truly understand him at all." Magee 2001, p. 2.&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2987">The '''Great Contraction''' is economist [[Milton Friedman]]'s term for the [[recession|recessionary period]] from 1929 until 1933, i.e., the early years of the [[Great Depression]].&lt;ref name=FriedmanSchwartz/&gt; The phrase was the title of a chapter in the landmark 1963 book ''[[A Monetary History of the United States]]'' by Friedman and his fellow [[monetarism|monetarist]] [[Anna J. Schwartz|Anna Schwartz]]. The chapter was later published as a stand-alone [[book]] titled ''The Great Contraction, 1929–1933'' in 1965.&lt;ref name=FriedmanSchwartz/&gt; Both books are still in print from [[Princeton University Press]], and some editions include as an appendix a speech honoring [[List of Nobel Memorial Prize laureates in Economics|Nobel laureate]] Friedman in which [[Federal Reserve Board of Governors|Fed Governor]] [[Ben Bernanke]] made this statement:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Let me end my talk by abusing slightly my status as an official representative of the Federal Reserve. I would like to say to Milton and Anna: Regarding the Great Depression, you're right. We did it. We're very sorry. But thanks to you, we won't do it again.&lt;ref&gt;Ben S. Bernanke (Nov. 8, 2002), [http://www.federalreserve.gov/boarddocs/speeches/2002/20021108/default.htm Federal Reserve Board Speech: "Remarks by Governor Ben S. Bernanke"], Conference to Honor Milton Friedman, University of Chicago&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=FriedmanSchwartz&gt;{{cite book|author1=Milton Friedman|author2=Anna Schwartz|title=The Great Contraction, 1929–1933 (New Edition)|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=-lCArZfazBkC&amp;q=%22Regarding%20the%20Great%20Depression%20You're%20right%20We%20did%20it%22|year=2008|publisher=Princeton University Press}}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;br&gt;
— Ben S. Bernanke &lt;/blockquote&gt;

Friedman and Schwartz argued that the [[Criticism of the Federal Reserve|Federal Reserve]] could have lessened the severity of the [[Causes of the Great Depression|Depression]], but failed to exercise its role of managing the [[monetary system]] and ameliorating [[bank runs|banking panics]] under [[Chairman of the Federal Reserve|Fed chairmen]] [[Roy A. Young|Roy Young]] and [[Eugene Meyer (financier)|Eugene Meyer]]. 

The Great Contraction is not to be confused with the [[Great Compression]], which refers to a period beginning around 1940 when (according to some economists such as [[Paul Krugman]]) [[economic inequality]] declined due to [[progressive tax|progressive taxation]] and other policies of the [[FDR]] administration.

'''Ilan Pappé''' ({{lang-he|אילן פפה}}; born 1954) is an expatriate Israeli historian and socialist activist. He is a professor with the College of Social Sciences and International Studies at the [[University of Exeter]] in the United Kingdom, director of the university's European Centre for Palestine Studies, and co-director of the Exeter Centre for Ethno-Political Studies.

Pappé is one of Israel's [[New Historians]] who, since the release of pertinent British and Israeli government documents in the early 1980s, have been [[historical revisionism|rewriting the history]] of Israel's creation in 1948, and the corresponding [[1948 Palestinian exodus|expulsion or flight]] of 700,000 [[Palestinian people|Palestinians]] in the same year. He has written that the expulsions were not decided on an ''[[ad hoc]]'' basis, as other historians have argued, but constituted the [[ethnic cleansing]] of [[Palestine (region)|Palestine]], in accordance with [[Plan Dalet]], drawn up in 1947 by Israel's future leaders.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last= Pappé |first= Ilan |year= 2007 |origyear= 2006 |title= The Ethnic Cleansing of Palestine |location= Oxford |publisher= Oneworld Publications |pages= 86–126 }}&lt;/ref&gt; He blames the creation of Israel for the lack of peace in the Middle East, arguing that Zionism is more dangerous than Islamic militancy, and has called for an international [[Academic boycotts of Israel|boycott of Israeli academics]].&lt;ref name=Wilson&gt;{{cite news |url= https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/03/10/AR2007031001252.html |last= Wilson |first= Scott |date= 11 March 2007 |title= A Shared History, a Different Conclusion |newspaper= The Washington Post |accessdate=17 May 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = "CSM 12May2005"&gt;{{cite news |url= http://www.csmonitor.com/2005/0512/p06s01-wome.html |last= Lynfield |first= Ben |date= 12 May 2005 |title= British Boycott Riles Israeli Academics |newspaper= The Christian Science Monitor |accessdate=17 May 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Pappé supports the [[one-state solution]], which envisages a binational state for Palestinians and Israelis.&lt;ref name = "Ynet 15Mar2008"&gt;{{cite news |url= http://www.ynetnews.com/articles/0,7340,L-3516193,00.html |last= Negev |first= Ayelet |date= 15 March 2008 |title= Ilan Pappe: I'm not a traitor |newspaper= [[Yedioth Ahronoth]] |accessdate=18 May 2012 |quote= &amp;#x005B;T&amp;#x005D;here needs to be one state here that isn't Jewish nor Palestinian, but a state of all its citizens, like in the US }}.&lt;/ref&gt;

His work has been both supported and criticized by other historians. Before he left Israel in 2008, he had been condemned in the [[Knesset]], Israel's parliament; a minister of education had called for him to be sacked; his photograph had appeared in a newspaper at the centre of a target; and he had received several death threats.&lt;ref name = "Arnot 2009"&gt;{{cite news |url= https://www.theguardian.com/education/2009/jan/20/interview-ilan-pappe-historian |last= Arnot |first= Chris |date= 20 January 2009 |title= &amp;nbsp;'I felt it was my duty to protest'&amp;nbsp; |newspaper= The Guardian |accessdate=17 May 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life and education==
Pappé was born in [[Haifa]], Israel, to German Jewish parents who fled Nazi persecution in the 1930s.&lt;ref name = "Arnot 2009"/&gt; At the age of 18, he was drafted into the [[Israel Defense Forces]], serving in the [[Golan Heights]] during the 1973 [[Yom Kippur War]].&lt;ref name ="LJ"/&gt; He graduated from the [[Hebrew University of Jerusalem]] in 1978, and in 1984 obtained his PhD in history from the [[University of Oxford]], under the guidance of [[Albert Hourani]] and [[Roger Owen (historian)|Roger Owen]].&lt;ref name ="LJ"/&gt; His doctoral thesis became his first book, ''Britain and the Arab-Israeli Conflict''.&lt;ref name=Wilson/&gt;

==Academic career==
{{Nakba}}
[[File:Dr. Ilan Pappé2.JPG|thumb|200px|left|Pappé in a lecture in the [[Manchester Metropolitan University]] in 2008]]
Pappé was a senior lecturer at the Middle Eastern History Department and the Political Science Department of the [[University of Haifa]] between 1984 and 2006.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://international.ucla.edu/cnes/event/9187|title=The False Paradigm of Parity and Partition: Revisiting 1967|website=international.ucla.edu}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was the Academic Director of the [[Projects working for peace among Israelis and Arabs#Givat Haviva's Jewish-Arab Center for Peace|Research Institute for Peace at Givat Haviva]] from 1993 to 2000, and chair of the [[Emil Touma]] Institute for Palestinian Studies.

Pappé left Israel in 2007 to take up his appointment in Exeter, after his endorsement of the boycott of Israeli universities led the president of the University of Haifa to call for his resignation.&lt;ref name = "Hatz 26Apr2005"&gt;{{cite news |url= http://www.haaretz.com/news/haifa-university-president-calls-on-dissident-academic-to-resign-1.156977 |last= Traubman |first= Tamara |date= 26 April 2005 |title= Haifa University president calls on dissident academic to resign |newspaper= Haaretz |accessdate=17 May 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Pappé said that he found it "increasingly difficult to live in Israel" with his "unwelcome views and convictions." In a [[Qatar]]i newspaper interview explaining his decision, he said: "I was boycotted in my university and there had been attempts to expel me from my job. I am getting threatening calls from people every day. I am not being viewed as a threat to the Israeli society but my people think that I am either insane or my views are irrelevant. Many Israelis also believe that I am working as a mercenary for the Arabs."&lt;ref name = "JP 17May2005"&gt;{{cite news |url= http://www.jpost.com/JewishWorld/JewishNews/Article.aspx?id=56753 |last= Paul |first= Jonny |date= 1 April 2007 |title= Academic slams Israel for land grab |newspaper= The Jerusalem Post |accessdate=17 May 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Katz controversy===
{{details|topic=The Katz controversy|Tantura}}
Pappé publicly supported an M.A. thesis by Haifa University student Teddy Katz, which was approved with highest honors, that claimed Israel had committed a massacre in the Palestinian village of [[Tantura]] during the war in 1948, based upon interviews with Arab residents of the village and with an Israeli veteran of the operation.&lt;ref name = "Segev 2002"&gt;{{cite news |url= http://www.haaretz.com/his-colleagues-call-him-a-traitor-1.44340 |last= Segev |first= Tom |authorlink = Tom Segev |date= 23 May 2002 |title= His colleagues call him a traitor |newspaper=Haaretz |accessdate=17 May 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Neither Israeli nor Palestinian historians had previously recorded any such incident, which [[Meyrav Wurmser]] described as a "made-up massacre",&lt;ref name = "made up"&gt;{{cite journal |url= http://www.weeklystandard.com/Content/Protected/Articles/000/000/000/099jjldm.asp |last= Wurmser |first= Meyrav |year= 2001 |title= Made-Up Massacre |journal= The Weekly Standard |volume= 6 |issue= 48 |accessdate=17 May 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; but, according to Pappé, "the story of Tantura had already been told before, as early as 1950... It appears in the memoirs of a Haifa notable, Muhammad Nimr al-Khatib, who, a few days after the battle, recorded the testimony of a Palestinian."&lt;ref&gt;''The Ethnic Cleansing of Palestine'', p.&amp;nbsp;137.&lt;/ref&gt; In December 2000, Katz was sued for libel by veterans of the [[Alexandroni Brigade]] and after the testimony was heard, he retracted his allegations about the massacre.

Katz revised his thesis, and, following the trial, the university appointed a committee to examine it.

==Political activism==
In 1999, Pappé ran in the [[Israeli legislative election, 1996|Knesset elections]] as seventh on the [[Maki (current political party)|Communist Party]]-led [[Hadash]] list.&lt;ref name="1996 election"&gt;{{cite web |url= https://www.knesset.gov.il/elections/asp/party.asp?id=6 |title= 1996 election results for Hadash—Democratic Front for Peace and Equality |publisher= knesset.gov.il |accessdate=17 May 2012 }} (Pappé is No.&amp;nbsp;7)&lt;/ref&gt;

After years of political activism, Pappé supports [[economic and political boycotts of Israel]], including an [[Academic boycotts of Israel|academic boycott]]. He believes boycotts are justified because "the [[Israeli-occupied territories|Israeli occupation]] is a dynamic process and it becomes worse with each passing day. The AUT can choose to stand by and do nothing, or to be part of a historical movement similar to the anti-apartheid campaign against the white supremacist regime in South Africa. By choosing the latter, it can move us forward along the only remaining viable and non-violent road to saving both Palestinians and Israelis from an impending catastrophe."&lt;ref name = "Graun 24May2005"&gt;{{cite news |url= https://www.theguardian.com/education/2005/may/24/highereducation.internationaleducationnews |last= Pappé |first= Ilan |date= 24 May 2005 |title= Back the boycott |newspaper= The Guardian |accessdate=17 May 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|If it is possible Israel's conduct in 1948 would be brought onto the stage of international tribunals; this may deliver a message even to the peace camp in Israel that reconciliation entails recognition of war crimes and collective atrocities. This cannot be done from within, as any reference in the Israeli press to expulsion, massacre or destruction in 1948 is usually denied and attributed to self hate and service to the enemy in times of war. This reaction encompasses academia, the media and educational system, as well as political circles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last= Pappé |first= Ilan |year= 2005 |chapter= The Process That Never Was |editor1-last= Podeh |editor1-first= Elie |editor2-last= Kaufman |editor2-first= Asher |title= Arab-Jewish Relations: From Conflict to Resolution? |location= Brighton |publisher= Sussex Academic Press |page= [https://books.google.com/books?id=MOzJeyjF2_UC&amp;pg=PA244 244]}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

As a result, then University of Haifa President [[Aaron Ben-Ze'ev]] called on Pappé to resign, saying: "it is fitting for someone who calls for a boycott of his university to apply the boycott himself."&lt;ref name = "Hatz 26Apr2005"/&gt; He said that Pappé would not be ostracized, since that would undermine [[academic freedom]], but he should leave voluntarily.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url= http://www.haaretz.com/print-edition/news/haifa-u-academic-remains-steadfast-in-support-of-boycott-1.157023 |last= Traubman |first= Tamara |date= 27 April 2005 |title= Haifa U. academic remains steadfast in support of boycott |newspaper= Haaretz |accessdate=17 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the same year, Pappé initiated the annual Israeli Right of return conferences, which called for the unconditional [[Palestinian right of return|right of return of the Palestinian refugees]] who were expelled in 1948.

In August 2015, Pappé was a signatory to a letter criticising ''[[The Jewish Chronicle]]''{{'}}s reporting of [[Jeremy Corbyn]]'s association with alleged [[Antisemitism|antisemites]].&lt;ref name="thejc"&gt;{{cite news |last=Dysch|first=Marcus|url=http://www.thejc.com/news/uk-news/142553/anti-israel-activists-attack-jc-challenging-jeremy-corbyn|title=Anti-Israel activists attack JC for challenging Jeremy Corbyn|work= |location= |publisher=''[[The Jewish Chronicle]]''|date=18 August 2015|accessdate=7 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Iman Xin Chemjong''' or '''Iman Singh Chemjong''':  was a [[Limbu people|Limbu]] historian, writer, [[linguist]], [[lexicographer]], [[folklorist]] and philosopher of [[Nepal]]. Although some say that his middle name ''Xin'' was spelled as ''Singh'' due to mainstream Nepalese or Indian influence, others say ''Singh'' is correct because in his book ''Kiratakalina Vijayapurako Sankshipta Itihasa'', Chemjong writes his name in [[Nepali language|Nepali]] as Iman Singh Chemjong. Chemjong devoted his entire life to studying and documenting various facets of [[Kirati]] tradition and culture at a time when such activities were frowned upon and even punished by the Nepalese ruling elite as being subversive and "anti-national". Chemjong's research into, and publication of, a Kiranti history and culture challenged perceptions of the Nepalese official [[doctrine]] that showcased [[Nepal]] as a [[Hindu]] cultural monolith devoid of alternative narratives.

Born in Renkebung village of [[Darjeeling district]], West Bengal, [[India]], Chemjong received his education at St. Xavier's College, then under the [[University of Calcutta]]. In 1928, he completed his certificate level and was about to enroll for a [[Bachelor degree]], when his father, Megbar Singh Chemjong, died. Chemjong junior had to put his academic aspirations on hold.

==Early influences==
Traditionally, [[Limbu people|Limbus]] observed a religion called [[Mundhum]] centred on [[animistic]] [[ritual]]s and practices. However, due to assimilation of Limbus into the [[Hindu]] mainstream, many Limbus adopted Hindu names and started to participate in Hindu [[worship]]s and festivals.

[[Limbu people|Limbus]] never really severed their ties to their rich religion and culture that stretched back to ancient times. Alongside [[Hindu goddesses]] [[Durga]] and [[Laxmi]], Limbus continued to worship their own supreme god Ningmaphuma. One such devoted Limbu worshipper was Chemjong's own mother, Devapu Hangma. Limbu Mundum religion is a rich cornucopia of oral traditions encompassing Kirati theology, [[mythology]], history, [[genealogy]], culture and traditions, and having a devout mother gave Chemjong a distinct advantage to learn all these.

A turning point in Chemjong's life came in 1925, when the legendary [[Limbu people|Limbu]] activist Lalshore Sendang visited [[Kalimpong]] in Darjeeling district and met Limbu elders and activists. Chemjong was one of the many Limbu youths who learned the [[Limbu alphabet|Limbu Sirijonga script]] from Sendang and attended his talks on Limbu religion and culture.

==Works==
Chemjong researched Limbu language and culture in Limbuwan, i.e. East Nepal, the neighbouring hill areas of Darjeeling and [[Sikkim]] (then an independent [[Himalaya]]n kingdom) and also in [[Assam]]. In his own lifetime, he published the following works:&lt;ref&gt;http://chumlung.org.np/page.php?page=11&lt;/ref&gt;

*''Kirat Itihas'' 1948
*''Kirat Sahityako Itihas'' 1955
*''Kirat Folklore'' 1961

*''Kirat Darshanko Saransh'' 1969
*''[[Lepcha language|Lepcha]]-Nepali-English Dictionary'' 1969
*''Bijayapurko Itihas'' 1974

==Recognition==
In a gesture that went against the grain of prevailing state ideology, [[King Tribhuvan]] invited Chemjong to join Nepal's [[Tribhuvan University]] in the capacity of "Limbu expert" in 1961. For years until his death, Chemjong headed a one-man Limbu research team at the then Nepal's only university. Chemjong appears to have held a "Kirant Bhasha Tatha Sanskriti Bishesagya (Specialist in Kiranti Language and Culture)" position at the Tribhuwan University, Kirtipur, [[Kathmandu]] as evidenced by his title in his book ''Kiratakalina Vijayapurako Sankshipta Itihasa'' published in 1975 and not as "Limbu expert".

Today, the Limbu community spread across mid- and eastern Nepal, West Bengal, Assam, Sikkim and [[Bhutan]] revere Chemjong as a hero for almost single-handedly researching and documenting various aspects of Limbu and Kirati life at a time when such activities were neither encouraged nor fashionable. Various functions are held each year to commemorate Chemjong's contributions.&lt;ref&gt;http://isikkim.com/107th-birth-anniversary-of-iman-chemjong/&lt;/ref&gt;

Chemjong is survived by his wife, Amiran Chemjong, two daughters, three sons and nine grandchildren.

{{Indo-European topics}}

'''Indo-Aryan migration''' models{{refn|group=note|The term "invasion", while it was once commonly used in regard to Indo-Aryan migration, is now usually used only by opponents of the Indo-Aryan migration theory.{{sfn|Witzel|2005|p=348}} The term "invasion" does not any longer reflect the scholarly understanding of the Indo-Aryan migrations,{{sfn|Witzel|2005|p=348}} and is now generally regarded as polemical, distracting and unscholarly.}} discuss scenarios around the theory of an origin from outside the [[Indian subcontinent]] of [[Indo-Aryan peoples]], an [[Racialization|ascribed]] [[ethnolinguistic group]] that spoke [[Indo-Aryan languages]], the predominant languages of [[North India]]. Proponents of Indo-Aryan origin outside of the [[Indian subcontinent]] generally consider migrations into the region and Anatolia (ancient [[Mitanni]]) from [[Central Asia]] to have started around 1500 BCE, as a slow diffusion during the [[Indus Valley Civilisation#Late Harappan|Late Harappan]] period, which led to a [[language shift]] in the northern Indian subcontinent. The Iranian languages were brought into Iran by the Iranians, who were closely related to the Indo-Aryans.

The [[Indo-Iranians|Proto-Indo-Iranian]] culture, which gave rise to the [[Indo-Aryan peoples|Indo-Aryans]] and Iranians, developed on the [[Eurasian Steppe#Central Steppe|Central Asian steppes]] north of the [[Caspian Sea]] as the [[Sintashta culture]] (2100–1800 BCE){{sfn|Anthony|2007|pp=408–411}}{{sfn|Anthony|2009|pp=390 (fig. 15.9), 405–411}}{{sfn|Kuz'mina|2007|p=222}} in present-day Russia and Kazakhstan, and developed further as the [[Andronovo culture]] (1800–1400 BCE),{{sfn|Anthony|2009|p=49}} around the [[Aral Sea]]. The proto-Indo-Iranians then migrated southwards to the [[Bactria–Margiana Archaeological Complex|Bactria-Margiana Culture]], from which they borrowed their distinctive religious beliefs and practices. The Indo-Aryans split off around 1800–1600 BCE from the Iranians,{{sfn|Anthony|2007|p=408}} whereafter the Indo-Aryans migrated into Anatolia and the northern part of the [[South Asia]] (modern [[Afghanistan]], [[Bangladesh]], [[India]], [[Pakistan]] and [[Nepal]]), while the Iranians moved into Iran, both bringing with them the [[Indo-Iranian languages]].

Migration by an [[Indo-European migrations|Indo-European people]] was first hypothesized in the late 18th century, following the discovery of the [[Indo-European languages|Indo-European language family]], when similarities between western and Indian languages had been noted. Given these similarities, a [[Proto-Indo-European language|single source or origin]] was proposed, which was diffused by migrations from some original homeland.

This linguistic argument is supported by archeological, anthropological, genetical, literary and ecological research. Genetic research reveals that those migrations form part of a complex genetic puzzle on the origin and spread of the various components of the Indian population. Literary research reveals similarities between various, geographically distinct, Indo-Aryan historical cultures. Ecological studies reveal that in the second millennium BCE widespread aridization lead to water shortages and ecological changes in both the Eurasian steppes and the [[Indian subcontinent]],&lt;ref group=web name="Kochhar2017"/&gt; causing the collapse of sedentary urban cultures in south central Asia, Afghanistan, Iran, and India, and triggering large-scale migrations, resulting in the merger of migrating peoples with the post-urban cultures.&lt;ref group=web name="Kochhar2017"/&gt;

The Indo-Aryan migrations started in approximately 1800 BCE, after the invention of the [[Chariot|war chariot]], and also brought Indo-Aryan languages into the [[Levant]] and possibly [[Inner Asia]]. It was part of the diffusion of [[Indo-European languages]] from the [[proto-Indo-European homeland]] at the [[Pontic–Caspian steppe]], a large area of [[grassland]]s in far [[Eastern Europe]], which started in the 5th to 4th millennia BCE, and the [[Indo-European migrations]] out of the [[Eurasian Steppe]]s, which started approximately in 2000 BCE.{{sfn|Beckwith|2009|p=33}}{{sfn|Witzel|2005|p=348}}

The theory posits that these Indo-Aryan speaking people may have been a genetically diverse group of people who were united by shared cultural norms and language, referred to as ''aryā'', "noble". Diffusion of this culture and language took place by patron-client systems, which allowed for the absorption and acculturation of other groups into this culture, and explains the strong influence on other cultures with which it interacted.

==Fundamentals==
[[File:IE expansion.png|thumb|Scheme of [[Indo-European migrations]], of which the Indo-Aryan migrations form a part, from ca. 4000 to 1000 BCE according to the [[Kurgan hypothesis]]:&lt;br /&gt;* The magenta area corresponds to the assumed ''[[Proto-Indo-European homeland|Urheimat]]'' ([[Samara culture]], [[Sredny Stog culture]] and the subsequent [[Yamna culture]]).&lt;br /&gt;* The red area corresponds to the area which may have been settled by Indo-European-speaking peoples up to ca. 2500 BCE.&lt;br /&gt;* The orange area corresponds to 1000 BCE.&lt;br /&gt; Source: Christopher I. Beckwith (2009), ''Empires of the Silk Road'', Oxford University Press, p.30.{{sfn|Beckwith|2009|p=30}}]]

The Indo-Aryan Migration theory is part of a larger theoretical framework. This framework explains the similarities between a wide range of contemporary and ancient languages. It combines linguistic, archaeological and anthropological research.{{sfn|Witzel|2005}}{{sfn|Anthony|2007}} This provides an overview of the development of Indo-European languages, and the spread of these Indo-European languages by migration and acculturation.{{sfn|Anthony|2007}}

===Linguistics: relationships between languages===
The linguistic part traces the connections between the various [[Indo-European languages]], and reconstructs the [[proto-Indo-European language]]. This is possible because the processes that change languages are not random, but follow strict patterns. Sound shifts, the changing of vowels and consonants, are especially important, although grammar (especially morphology) and the lexicon (vocabulary) may also be significant. Historical-comparative linguistics thus makes it possible to see great similarities between languages which at first sight might seem very different.{{sfn|Anthony|2007}} Various characteristics of the Indo-European languages argue against an Indian origin of these languages, and point to a steppe origin of these languages.

===Archaeology: migrations from the steppe Urheimat===
The archaeological part posits an [[Proto-Indo-European homeland|"Urheimat"]] on the Pontic steppes, which developed after the introduction of cattle on the steppes around 5,200 BCE.{{sfn|Anthony|2007}} This introduction marked the change from foragist to pastoralist cultures, and the development of a hierarchical social system with chieftains, patron-client systems, and the exchange of goods and gifts.{{sfn|Anthony|2007}} The oldest nucleus may have been the [[Samara culture]] (late 6th and early 5th millennium BCE), at a bend in the Volga.

A wider "horizon" developed, called the [[Kurgan hypothesis|Kurgan culture]] by [[Marija Gimbutas]] in the 1950s. She included several cultures in this "Kurgan Culture", including the Samara culture and the Yamna culture, although the [[Yamna culture]] (36th–23rd centuries BCE), also called "Pit Grave Culture", may more aptly be called the "nucleus" of the proto-Indo-European language.{{sfn|Anthony|2007}} From this area, which already included various subcultures, Indo-European languages spread west, south and east starting around 4,000 BCE.{{sfn|Beckwith|2009|p=29}} These languages may have been carried by small groups of males, with patron-client systems which allowed for the inclusion of other groups into their cultural system.{{sfn|Anthony|2007}}

Eastward emerged the [[Sintashta culture]] (2100–1800 BCE), where common Indo-Iranian was spoken.{{sfn|Anthony|2007|p=408}} Out of the Shintashta culture developed the [[Andronovo culture]] (1800–1400 BCE), which interacted with the [[Bactria–Margiana Archaeological Complex|Bactria-Margiana Culture]] (2300–1700 BCE). This interaction further shaped the Indo-Iranians, which split at c. 1800–1600 BCE into the Indo-Aryans and the Iranians.{{sfn|Anthony|2007|p=408}} The Indo-Aryans migrated to the Levant, northern India, and possibly [[South Asia]].{{sfn|Beckwith|2009}} The migration into northern India was not a large-scale immigration, but may have consisted of small groups{{sfn|Witzel|2005|pp=342–343}}{{refn|group=note|Michael Witzel: "Just one 'Afghan' IA tribe that did not return to the highlands but stayed in their Panjab winter quarters in spring was needed to set off a wave of acculturation in the plains, by transmitting its 'status kit' (Ehret) to its neighbors."{{sfn|Witzel|2005|pp=342–343}}&lt;br /&gt;Compare Max Muller: "why should not one shepherd, with his servants and flocks, have transferred his peculiar dialect from one part of Asia or Europe to another? This may seem a very humble and modest view of what was formerly represented as the irresistible stream of mighty waves rolling forth from the Aryan centre and gradually overflowing the mountains and valleys of Asia and Europe, but it is, at all events, a possible view; nay, I should say a view far more in keeping with what we know of recent colonisation."{{sfn|Muller|1988|p=91}}}} which were genetically diverse. Their culture and language spread by the same mechanisms of acculturalisation, and the absorption of other groups into their patron-client system.{{sfn|Anthony|2007}}

===Anthropology: elite recruitment and language shift===
{{See also|Language shift}}

Indo-European languages probably spread through language shifts.{{sfn|Parpola|2015|p=67}}{{sfn|Mallory|2002}}{{sfn|Salmons|2015|pp=114–119}} Small groups can change a larger cultural area,{{sfn|Witzel|2005|p=347}}{{sfn|Anthony|2007}} and elite male dominance by small groups may have led to a language shift in northern India.{{sfn|Basu et al.|2003|p=2287}}{{sfn|Anthony|2007|pp=117–118}}{{sfn|Pereltsvaig|Lewis|2015|pp=208–215}}

David Anthony, in his "revised Steppe hypothesis"{{sfn|Pereltsvaig|Lewis|2015|p=205}} notes that the spread of the Indo-European languages probably did not happen through "chain-type folk migrations", but by the introduction of these languages by ritual and political elites, which were emulated by large groups of people,{{sfn|Anthony|2007|p=117}}{{refn|group=note|name="Anthony_Language_shift"}} a process which he calls "elite recruitment".{{sfn|Anthony|2007|p=118}}

According to Parpola, local elites joined "small but powerful groups" of Indo-European speaking migrants.{{sfn|Parpola|2015|p=67}} These migrants had an attractive social system and good weapons, and luxury goods which marked their status and power. Joining these groups was attractive for local leaders, since it strengthened their position, and gave them additional advantages.{{sfn|Parpola|2015|pp=67–68}} These new members were further incorporated by [[Marriage|matrimonial]] alliances.{{sfn|Parpola|2015|p=68}}{{sfn|Mallory|2002}}

According to Joseph Salmons, language shift is facilitated by "dislocation" of language communities, in which the elite is taken over.{{sfn|Salmons|2015|p=118}} According to Salmons, this change is facilitated by "systematic changes in community structure", in which a local community becomes incorporated in a larger social structure.{{sfn|Salmons|2015|p=118}}{{refn|group=note|name="dislocation"}}

===Genetics: ancient ancestry and multiple gene flows===
{{See also|Genetics and archaeogenetics of South Asia|Peopling of India}}

The Indo-Aryan migrations form part of a complex genetic puzzle on the origin and spread of the various components of the Indian population, including various waves of admixture and language shift. There is "general agreement" that north and south Indians share a common maternal ancestry.{{sfn|Kivisild et al.|1999}}{{sfn|Kivisild et al.|2003}}{{sfn|Sharma|2005}}{{sfn|Sahoo et al.|2006}} A series of studies show that the [[Indian subcontinent]] harbours two major ancestral components,{{sfn|Reich et al.|2009}}{{sfn|Metspalu et al.|2011}}{{sfn|Moorjani et al.|2013}} namely the ''Ancestral North Indians'' (ANI) which is "genetically close to Middle Easterners, Central Asians, and Europeans", and the ''Ancestral South Indians'' (ASI) which is clearly distinct from ANI.{{sfn|Reich et al.|2009}}{{refn|group=note|Basu et al. (2016) discern four major ancestries in mainland India, namely ANI, ASI, Ancestral Austro-Asiatic tribals (AAA) and Ancestral Tibeto-Burman (ATB).{{sfn|Basu et al.|2016|p=1594}}}} These two groups mixed in India between 4,200 and 1,900 years ago (2200 BCE-100 CE), whereafter a shift to endogamy took place,{{sfn|Moorjani et al.|2013}} possibly by the enforcement of "social values and norms" by the "Hindu Gupta rulers".{{sfn|Basu et al.|2016|p=1598}}

Moorjani et al. (2013) describe three scenarios regarding the bringing together of the two groups: [[Recent African origin of modern humans|migrations before the development of agriculture]] (before 8,000–9,000 years before present (BP); migration of [[Ancient Near East|western Asian]]{{refn|group=note|See also [[Fertile Crescent]], [[Western Asia]] and [[Near East]].}} [[Dravidian people|people]] together with the [[Neolithic Revolution|spread of agriculture]], maybe up to 4,600 years BP; migrations of [[Kurgan hypothesis|western Eurasians]] from 3,000 to 4,000 years BP.{{sfn|Moorjani et al.|2013|pp=422–423}}

While Reich notes that the onset of admixture coincides with the arrival of Indo-European language,&lt;ref group=web name="Reich-interview" /&gt; according to Moorjani et al. (2013) these groups were present "unmixed" in India before the Indo-Aryan migrations.{{sfn|Moorjani et al.|2013}} Gallego Romero et al. (2011) propose that the ANI component came from Iran and the Middle East,{{sfn|Gallego Romero|2011|p=9}} less than 10,000 years ago,&lt;ref group=web name="ScienceLife2011" /&gt;{{refn|group=note|name="Dravidian"}} while according to Lazaridis et al. (2016) ANI is a mix of "early farmers of western Iran" and "people of the Bronze Age Eurasian steppe".{{sfn|Lazaridis et al.|2016}} Several studies also show traces of later influxes of maternal genetic material{{sfn|Kivisild et al.|1999}}&lt;ref group=web name="Kivisild2000" /&gt; and of paternal genetic material related to ANI and possibly the Indo-Europeans.{{sfn|Reich et al.|2009}}{{sfn|Jones|2015}}{{sfn|Basu et al.|2016}}

===Literary research: similarities, geography, and references to migration===
The oldest inscription in Old Indic is found in northern Syria in [[Hittites|Hittite]] records regarding the [[Hurrians|Hurrian]]-speaking Mitanni.{{sfn|Mallory|Mair|2000}}{{sfn|Mallory|1989}} The religious practices depicted in the ''Rigveda'' and those depicted in the ''[[Avesta]]'', the central religious text of [[Zoroastrianism]], show similarities.{{sfn|Mallory|1989}} Some of the references to the Sarasvati in the Rigveda refer to the [[Ghaggar-Hakra River]],&lt;ref name="Ancient Indian Geography p.590"&gt;"Encyclopaedia of Ancient Indian Geography, Volume 2", by Subodh Kapoor, p.590&lt;/ref&gt; while the Afghan river Haraxvaiti/Harauvati [[Helmand River|Helmand]] is sometimes quoted as the locus of the early Rigvedic river.&lt;ref name="Vedas p. 7"&gt;"Discovering the Vedas: Origins, Mantras, Rituals, Insights", p. 7, by Frits Staal&lt;/ref&gt; The Rigveda does not explicitly refer to an external homeland{{sfn|Majumdar|Pusalker|1951|p=220}} or to a migration,{{sfn|Cardona|2002|pp=33–35}} but later Vedic and Puranic texts do show the movement into the Gangetic plains.

===Ecological studies: widespread drought, urban collapse, and pastoral migrations===
Climate change and drought may have triggered both the initial dispersal of Indo-European speakers, and the migration of Indo-Europeans from the steppes in south central Asia and India.

Around 4200–4100 BCE [[5.9 kiloyear event|a climate change occurred]], manifesting in colder winters in Europe.{{sfn|Anthony|2007|p=227}} Steppe herders, archaic Proto-Indo-European speakers, spread into the lower Danube valley about 4200–4000 BCE, either causing or taking advantage of the collapse of [[Old Europe (archaeology)|Old Europe]].{{sfn|Anthony|2007|p=133}}

The Yamna horizon was an adaptation to a climate change which occurred between 3500 and 3000 BCE, in which the steppes became drier and cooler. Herds needed to be moved frequently to feed them sufficiently, and the use of wagons and horse-back riding made this possible, leading to "a new, more mobile form of pastoralism".{{sfn|Anthony|2007|p=300, 336}}

In the second millennium BCE widespread aridification led to water shortages and ecological changes in both the Eurasian steppes and the [[Indian subcontinent]].&lt;ref group=web name="Kochhar2017"&gt;Rajesh Kochhar (2017), [http://indianexpress.com/article/opinion/columns/aryans-dna-genetics-archaeology-4765740/ ''The Aryan chromosome''], The Indian ERxpress&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|Demkina|2017}} On the steppes, humidification led to a change of vegetation, triggering "higher mobility and transition to nomadic cattle breeding".{{sfn|Demkina|2017}}{{refn|group=note|Demkina et al. (2017): "In the second millennium BC, humidification of the climate led to the divergence of the soil cover with secondary formation of the complexes of chestnut soils and solonetzes. This paleoecological crisis had a significant effect on the economy of the tribes in the Late Catacomb and Post-Catacomb time stipulating their higher mobility and transition to the nomadic cattle breeding."{{sfn|Demkina|2017}}}}{{refn|group=note|See also Eurogenes Blogspot, [http://eurogenes.blogspot.nl/2017/07/the-crisis.html ''The crisis''].}} Water shortage also had a strong impact in the [[Indian subcontinent]], "causing the collapse of sedentary urban cultures in south central Asia, Afghanistan, Iran, and India, and triggering large-scale migrations".&lt;ref group=web name="Kochhar2017"/&gt;

==Development==

===Similarities between Sanskrit, Greek, Latin, Persian, Celtic and German===
When the British started to colonize India in the 18th century, they had to impose a legal system on both the British merchants and the Indians. The Indians already had a legal system, which was unknown to the British colonizers. To integrate these systems, the British had to learn Sanskrit, a task which was given to Sir [[William Jones (philologist)|William Jones]]. He learned Sanskrit, and studied Sanskrit texts, at the ancient Hindu university at Nadiya. He noted the similarities of Sanskrit with Persian, English, Latin, Greek and Gothic. After three years of studies, in an announcement to the Asiatic Society of Bengal, he made the famous statement:
{{quote|The Sanskrit language, whatever be its antiquity, is of a wonderful structure; more perfect than the Greek, more copious than the Latin, and more exquisitely refined than either, yet bearing to both of them a stronger affinity, both in the roots of verbs and in the forms of grammar, than could possibly have been produced by accident; so strong indeed, that no philologer could examine them all three, without believing them to have sprung from some common source, which, perhaps, no longer exists: there is a similar reason, though not quite so forcible, for supposing that both the Gothic and the Celtic, though blended with a very different idiom, had the same origin with the Sanskrit; and the old Persian might be added to the same family, if this were the place for discussing any question concerning the antiquities of Persia.{{sfn|Anthony|2007|p=7}}&lt;ref group=web&gt;[http://www.utexas.edu/cola/centers/lrc/general/histling.html Jonathan Slocum, ''What is Historical Linguistics? What are 'Indo-European' Languages?'', The University of Texas at Austin] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071030105123/http://www.utexas.edu/cola/centers/lrc/general/histling.html |date=30 October 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Jones concluded that all these languages originated from the same source.{{sfn|Anthony|2007|p=7}}

Most scholars assumed a homeland either in Europe or in Western Asia, and [[Sanskrit]] must in this case have reached India by a language transfer from west to east.{{sfn|Senthil Kumar|2012|p=123}}&lt;ref name="JH" /&gt;

Some scholars favoured an Indian "homeland". In 19th century [[Indo-European studies]], the language of the [[Rigveda]] was the most archaic Indo-European language known to scholars, indeed the only records of Indo-European that could reasonably claim to date to the [[Bronze Age]]. This primacy of Sanskrit inspired some scholars, such as [[Karl Wilhelm Friedrich Schlegel|Friedrich Schlegel]], to assume that the locus of the [[proto-Indo-European homeland]] had been in India, with the other dialects spread to the west by historical migration. This was however never a mainstream position even in the 19th century.{{sfn|Senthil Kumar|2012|p=123}}&lt;ref name="JH" /&gt;

With the 20th-century discovery of Bronze-Age attestations of Indo-European ([[Anatolian languages|Anatolian]], [[Mycenaean Greek]]), [[Vedic Sanskrit]] lost its special status as the most archaic Indo-European language known.{{sfn|Senthil Kumar|2012|p=123}}&lt;ref name="JH"&gt;"Tense and Aspect in Indo-European Languages", by John Hewson, Page 229&lt;/ref&gt;

===Aryan "race"===
[[File:Aryans entering India.jpg|thumb|A 1910 depiction of Aryans entering India, from Hutchinson's "History of the Nations"]]
{{Main|Aryan race|Scientific racism}}

In the 1850s [[Max Müller]] introduced the notion of two Aryan races, a western and an eastern one, who migrated from the Caucasus into Europe and India respectively. Müller dichotomized the two groups, ascribing greater prominence and value to the western branch. Nevertheless, this "eastern branch of the Aryan race was more powerful than the indigenous eastern natives, who were easy to conquer".{{sfn|McGetchin|2015|p=116}} By the 1880s, his ideas had been "hijacked" by racist [[Ethnology|ethnologists]]. For example, as an exponent of [[Scientific racism|race science]], colonial administrator [[Herbert Hope Risley]] (1851–1911) used the ratio of the width of a [[nose]] to its height to divide [[Indian people]] into Aryan and Dravidian races, as well as seven castes.{{sfnp|Trautmann|1997|=p=203|ps=}}{{sfnp|Walsh|2011|=p=171|ps=}}

Müller's work contributed to the developing interest in [[Aryan]] culture, which often set Indo-European ('Aryan') traditions in opposition to [[Abrahamic religions|Semitic]] religions. He was "deeply saddened by the fact that these classifications later came to be expressed in [[racism|racist]] terms", as this was far from his intention.{{sfn|Esleben|2008}}{{refn|group=note|Esleben: "In later years, especially before his death, he was deeply saddened by the fact that these classifications later came to be expressed in racist terms."{{sfn|Esleben|2008}}}} For Müller the discovery of common Indian and European ancestry was a powerful argument against racism, arguing that "an ethnologist who speaks of Aryan race, Aryan blood, Aryan eyes and hair, is as great a sinner as a linguist who speaks of a dolichocephalic dictionary or a brachycephalic grammar" and that "the blackest Hindus represent an earlier stage of Aryan speech and thought than the fairest Scandinavians".&lt;ref&gt;F. Max Müller, ''Biographies of Words and the Home of the Aryas'' (1888), Kessinger Publishing reprint, 2004, p.120; Dorothy Matilda Figueira, ''Aryans, Jews, Brahmins: Theorizing Authority Through Myths of Identity'', SUNY Press, 2002, p.45&lt;/ref&gt; In his later work, Max Müller took great care to limit the use of the term "Aryan" to a strictly linguistic one.{{sfn|McGetchin|2015|p=117}}

==="Aryan invasion"===
The excavation of the [[Harappa]], [[Mohenjo-daro]] and [[Lothal]] sites of the [[Indus Valley Civilisation]] (IVC) in the 1920,{{sfn|Bryant|Patton|2005}} showed that northern India already had an advanced culture when the Indo-Aryans migrated into the area. The theory changed from a migration of advanced Aryans towards a primitive aboriginal population, to a migration of nomadic people into an advanced urban civilization, comparable to the Germanic migrations during the [[Fall of the Western Roman Empire]], or the [[Kassites|Kassite]] invasion of [[Babylonia]].&lt;ref name="GLP" /&gt;

This possibility was for a short time seen as a hostile invasion into northern India. The [[Indus Valley Civilisation#Late Harappan|decline]] of the [[Indus Valley Civilisation]] at precisely the period in history in which the Indo-Aryan migrations probably took place, seemed to provide independent support of such an invasion. This argument was proposed by the mid-20th century archaeologist [[Mortimer Wheeler]], who interpreted the presence of many unburied corpses found in the top levels of Mohenjo-daro as the victims of conquest wars, and who famously stated that the god "[[Indra]] stands accused" of the destruction of the Civilisation.&lt;ref name="GLP" /&gt;

This position was soon left by the scholarly community, noticing that no evidence was found, and that the skeletons were found to be hasty interments, not massacred victims.&lt;ref name="GLP"&gt;{{citation |title=The Indus Civilization: A Contemporary Perspective |author = Gregory L. Possehl |publisher=Rowman Altamira |year=2002 |isbn=9780759101722| page = 238}}&lt;/ref&gt; Wheeler himself also nuanced this interpretation in later publications, stating "This is a possibility, but it can't be proven, and it may not be correct."{{sfn|Wheeler|1967|p=76}} Wheeler further notes that the unburied corpses may indicate an event in the final phase of human occupation of Mohenjo-Daro, and that thereafter the place was uninhabited, but that the decay of Mohenjo-Daro has to be ascribed to structural causes such as salinisation.{{sfn|Wheeler|1967|pp=82–83}}

Nevertheless, although "no informed Western scholar speaks of 'invasions' anymore", critics of the Indo-Aryan Migration theory continue to present the theory as an "Aryan Invasion Theory",{{sfn|Witzel|2005|p=348}}{{sfn|Bryant|2001|p=306}}{{refn|group=note|According to Bryant, keeping up-to-date is problematic for many Indian scholars, since most Indian universities don't have enough funds to keep up with current scholarship, and most Indian scholars are not able to gain access to recent western publications.{{sfn|Bryant|2001|p=306}} Bryant further notes that "while one would be lucky to find a book by Max Muller even in the antique book markets of London, one can find a plethora of recent-edition publications of his and other nineteenth-century scholars' works in just about any bookstore in India (some of these on their tenth or twelfth edition). Practically speaking, it is small Delhi publishers that are keeping the most crude versions of the Aryan invasion theory alive by their nineteenth-century reprints! These are some of the main sources available to most Indian readers."{{sfn|Bryant|2001|p=306}}}} presenting it as a racist and colonialist discourse:
{{quote|The theory of an immigration of IA speaking Arya ("Aryan invasion") is simply seen as a means of British policy to justify their own intrusion into India and their subsequent colonial rule: in both cases, a "white race" was seen as subduing the local darker colored population.{{sfn|Witzel|2005|p=348}}}}

===Aryan migration===
[[File:Aryans settling in India.jpg|thumb|An early 20th century depiction of Aryans settling in agricultural villages in India]]
In the later 20th century, ideas were refined along with data accrual, and migration and [[acculturation]] were seen as the methods whereby Indo-Aryans and their language and culture spread into northwest India around 1500 BCE. The term "invasion" is only being used nowadays by opponents of the Indo-Aryan Migration theory.{{sfn|Witzel|2005|p=348}}{{sfn|Bryant|2001|p=306}} Michael Witzel:
{{quote|...it has been supplanted by much more sophisticated models over the past few decades [...] philologists first, and archaeologists somewhat later, noticed certain inconsistencies in the older theory and tried to find new explanations, a new version of the immigration theories.{{sfn|Witzel|2005|p=348}}{{refn|group=note|Michael Witzel: "In these views, though often for quite different reasons, any immigration or trickling in – nearly always called "invasion" – of the (Indo-)Aryans into the subcontinent is suspect or simply denied. The [[Arya]] of the Rigveda are supposed to be just another tribe or group of tribes that have always been resident in India, next to Dravidians, Mundas, etc. The theory of an immigration of IA speaking Arya ("Aryan invasion") is simply seen as a means of British policy to justify their own intrusion into India and their subsequent colonial rule: in both cases, a "white race" was seen as subduing the local darker colored population.&lt;br /&gt;However, present (European, American, Japanese, etc.) Indologists do not maintain anything like this now [...] While the "invasion model" was still prominent in the work of archaeologists such as Wheeler (1966: "Indra stands accused"), it has been supplanted by much more sophisticated models over the past few decades (see Kuiper 1955 sqq.; Thapar 1968; Witzel 1995). This development has not occurred because Indologists were reacting, as is now frequently alleged, to current Indian criticism of the older theory. Rather, philologists first, and archaeologists somewhat later, noticed certain inconsistencies in the older theory and tried to find new explanations, a new version of the immigration theories.{{sfn|Witzel|2005|p=348}}}}}}

These changes were thought to be in line with changes in thinking about language transfer in general, such as the migration of the [[Greeks]] into Greece (between 2100 and 1600 BCE) and their adoption of a syllabic script, [[Linear B]], from the pre-existing [[Linear A]], with the purpose of writing [[Mycenaean Greek]], or the Indo-Europeanization of Western Europe (in stages between 2200 and 1300 BCE).

===Future directions===
{{update section|date=May 2017}}
Mallory notes that with the development and the growing sophistication of the knowledge on the Indo-European migrations and their purported homeland, new questions arise, and that "it is evident that we still have a very long way to go."{{sfn|Mallory|2012|p=152}} One of those questions is the origin of the shared agricultural vocabulary, and the earliest dates for agriculturalism in areas settled by the Indo-Europeans. Those dates seem to be too late to account for the shared vocabulary, and raise the question what their origin is.{{sfn|Mallory|2012|pp=149–152}} In 2016, publications are expected on DNA-analysis of Harappans, which may answer the question to which non-Indian populations they were related.

==Linguistics: relationships between languages==
{{Main|Linguistics}}

Linguistic research traces the connections between the various Indo-European languages, and reconstructs proto-Indo-European. Accumulated linguistic evidence points to the Indo-Aryan languages as intrusive into the [[Indian subcontinent]], some time in the [[2nd millennium BC]]E.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Indo-Aryans of Ancient South Asia: Language, Material Culture and Ethnicity|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=OZ0gAAAAQBAJ|first=George|last=Erdosy|page=16|publisher=Walter de Gruyter|isbn=978-3110816433|date=1 January 1995}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=An Atlas and Survey of South Asian History|first=Karl|last=Schmidt|page=14|publisher=Routledge|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=BqdzCQAAQBAJ|year=2015|isbn=978-1317476818}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title= Central Asia in World History |quote= coming through Afghanistan, entered South Asia around 1500 BCE |first=Peter |last=Golden |page=21 |publisher= Oxford University Press |isbn= 978-0199722037 |year=2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title= The Origins of Yoga and Tantra: Indic Religions to the Thirteenth Century |quote= entered South Asia in the course of the second millennium BCE |publisher= Cambridge University Press |isbn= 978-1139470216 |page=99 |first=Geoffrey |last=Samuel |year=2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; The language of the [[Rigveda]], the earliest stratum of [[Vedic Sanskrit]], is assigned to about 1500–1200 BCE.{{sfn|Mallory|Mair|2000}}

===Comparative method===
{{Main|Comparative method (linguistics)}}

Connections between languages can be traced because the processes that change languages are not random, but follow strict patterns. Especially sound shifts, the changing of vowels and consonants, are important, although grammar (especially morphology) and the lexicon (vocabulary) may also be significant. Historical-comparative linguistics thus makes it possible to see great similarities between languages which at first sight might seem very different.{{sfn|Anthony|2007}}

Linguistics use the '''comparative method''' to study the development of languages by performing a feature-by-feature comparison of two or more languages with common descent from a shared ancestor, as opposed to the method of [[internal reconstruction]], which analyses the internal development of a single language over time.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Lehmann|1993|pp=31 ff}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Ordinarily both methods are used together to reconstruct prehistoric phases of languages, to fill in gaps in the historical record of a language, to discover the development of phonological, morphological, and other linguistic systems, and to confirm or refute hypothesized relationships between languages.

The comparative method aims to prove that two or more historically [[attested language]]s are descended from a single [[proto-language]] by comparing lists of [[cognate]] terms. From them, regular sound correspondences between the languages are established, and a sequence of regular [[sound change]]s can then be postulated, which allows the proto-language to be [[Linguistic reconstruction|reconstructed]]. Relation is deemed certain only if at least a partial reconstruction of the common ancestor is feasible, and if regular sound correspondences can be established with chance similarities ruled out.

The comparative method was developed over the 19th century. Key contributions were made by the Danish scholars [[Rasmus Rask]] and [[Karl Verner]] and the German scholar [[Jacob Grimm]]. The first linguist to offer reconstructed forms from a [[proto-language]] was [[August Schleicher]], in his ''Compendium der vergleichenden Grammatik der indogermanischen Sprachen'', originally published in 1861.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Lehmann|1993|p=26}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Proto-Indo-European===
Proto-Indo-European ('''PIE''') is the [[linguistic reconstruction]] of the common ancestor of the [[Indo-European languages]]. PIE was the first proposed [[proto-language]] to be widely accepted by linguists. Far more work has gone into reconstructing it than any other proto-language, and it is by far the best understood of all proto-languages of its age. During the 19th century, the vast majority of linguistic work was devoted to reconstruction of Proto-Indo-European or its daughter proto-languages such as [[Proto-Germanic]], and most of the current techniques of [[linguistic reconstruction]] in [[historical linguistics]] (e.g., the [[Comparative method (linguistics)|comparative method]] and the method of [[internal reconstruction]]) were developed as a result. These methods supply all of our knowledge concerning PIE, since there is no written record of the language.

Scholars estimate that PIE may have been spoken as a single language (before divergence began) around 3500 BCE, though estimates by different authorities can vary by more than a millennium. A [[Proto-Indo-European homeland|number of hypotheses]] have been proposed for the origin and spread of the language, the most popular among linguists being the [[Kurgan hypothesis]], which postulates an origin in the [[Pontic–Caspian steppe]] of Eastern Europe. Features of the culture of the speakers of PIE, known as [[Proto-Indo-Europeans]], have also been reconstructed based on the shared vocabulary of the early [[attested language|attested]] Indo-European languages.

The existence of PIE was first postulated in the 18th century by Sir [[William Jones (philologist)|William Jones]], who observed the similarities between [[Sanskrit]], [[Ancient Greek]], and [[Latin]]. By the early 20th century, well-defined descriptions of PIE had been developed that are still accepted today (with some refinements). The largest developments of the 20th century were the discovery of the [[Anatolian languages|Anatolian]] and [[Tocharian languages]] and the acceptance of the [[laryngeal theory]]. The Anatolian languages have also spurred a major re-evaluation of theories concerning the development of various shared Indo-European language features and the extent to which these features were present in PIE itself. Relationships to other language families, including the [[Uralic languages]], have been proposed but remain controversial.

PIE is thought to have had a complex system of [[Morphology (linguistics)|morphology]] that included [[inflection|inflectional suffixes]] as well as [[Indo-European ablaut|ablaut]] (vowel alterations, as preserved in English ''sing, sang, sung''). Nouns and verbs had complex systems of [[declension]] and [[Grammatical conjugation|conjugation]] respectively.

===Arguments against an Indian origin of proto-Indo-European===
====Diversity====
According to the linguistic center of gravity principle, the most likely point of origin of a language family is in the area of its greatest diversity.{{sfn|Sapir|1949|p=455}}{{refn|group=note|[[Robert Gordon Latham|Latham]], as cited in {{harvnb|Mallory|1989|p=152}}}} By this criterion, Northern India, home to only a single branch of the Indo-European language family (i.e., [[Indo-Aryan languages|Indo-Aryan]]), is an exceedingly unlikely candidate for the Indo-European homeland, compared to Central-Eastern Europe, for example, which is home to the [[Italic languages|Italic]], [[Venetic language|Venetic]], [[Illyrian languages|Illyrian]], [[Albanian language|Albanian]], [[Germanic languages|Germanic]], [[Baltic languages|Baltic]], [[Slavic languages|Slavic]], [[Thracian language|Thracian]] and [[Greek language|Greek]] branches of Indo-European.{{sfn|Mallory|1989|pp=152–153}}

Both mainstream [[Urheimat]] solutions locate the Proto-Indo-European homeland in the vicinity of the [[Black Sea]].{{sfn|Mallory|1989|pp=177–185}}

====Dialectical variation====

It has been recognized since the mid-19th century, beginning with [[Johannes Schmidt (linguist)|Schmidt]] and [[Hugo Schuchardt|Schuchardt]], that a binary [[tree model]] cannot capture all linguistic alignments; certain [[areal feature]]s cut across language groups and are better explained through a model treating linguistic change like [[Wave model|waves]] rippling out through a pond. This is true of the [[Indo-European languages]] as well. Various features originated and spread while [[Proto-Indo-European language|Proto-Indo-European]] was still a [[dialect continuum]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvtxt|Hock|1991|p=454}}&lt;/ref&gt; These features sometimes cut across sub-families: for instance, the [[Instrumental case|instrumental]], [[Dative case|dative]] and [[Ablative case|ablative]] plurals in [[Germanic languages|Germanic]] and [[Balto-Slavic languages|Balto-Slavic]] feature endings beginning with -m-, rather than the usual -*bh-, e.g. [[Old Church Slavonic]] instrumental plural ''[[wikt:съінъ#Old Church Slavonic|synъ-mi]]'' 'with sons',&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvtxt|Fortson|2004|p=106}}&lt;/ref&gt; despite the fact that the Germanic languages are [[Centum and satem languages|centum]], while Balto-Slavic languages are [[Centum and satem languages|satem]].

The strong correspondence between the [[dialect|dialectical relationships]] of the Indo-European languages and their actual geographical arrangement in their earliest attested forms makes an [[Indian subcontinent|Indian]] origin, as suggested by the [[Indigenous Aryans|Out of India Theory]], unlikely.&lt;ref name=hock1999&gt;Hock (1996), "Out of India? The linguistic evidence", in {{Harvtxt|Bronkhorst|Deshpande|1999}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Substrate influence====
{{Main|Substratum in the Vedic language}}

Already in 1870s the Neogrammarians realised that the Greek/Latin vocalism couldn't be explained on the basis of the Sanskrit one, and therefore must be more original.{{citation needed|date=July 2017}} The Indo-Iranian and Uralic languages influenced each other, with the Finno-Ugric languages containing Indo-European loan words. A telling example is the Finnish word ''vasara'', "hammer", which is related to ''[[vajra]]'', the weapon of [[Indra]]. Since the Finno-Ugric homeland was located in the northern forest zone in northern Europe, the contacts must have taken place – in line with the placement of the proto-Indo-European homeland at the Pontic-Caspian steppes – between the Black Sea and the Caspian Sea.&lt;ref group=web name="Kochhar2017"/&gt;

Dravidian and other South Asian languages share with Indo-Aryan a number of [[syntactical]] and [[Morphology (linguistics)|morphological]] features that are alien to other Indo-European languages, including even its closest relative, [[Iranian languages#Old Iranian|Old Iranian]]. [[Phonology|Phonologically]], there is the introduction of [[Retroflex consonant|retroflexes]], which alternate with [[Dental consonant|dentals]] in Indo-Aryan; morphologically there are the [[gerund]]s; and syntactically there is the use of a [[quotative]] [[Marker (linguistics)|marker]] (''iti'').{{refn|group=note|Krishnamurti states: "Besides, the {{IAST|Ṛg}} [[Vedas]] has used the gerund, not found in [[Avestan]], with the same grammatical function as in [[Dravidian languages|Dravidian]], as a non-finite verb for 'incomplete' action. {{IAST|Ṛg}} Vedic language also attests the use of it as a quotation clause complementary. All these features are not a consequence of simple borrowing but they indicate substratum influence (Kuiper 1991: ch 2)".}} These are taken as evidence of [[Stratum (linguistics)#Substratum|substratum]] influence.

It has been argued {{By whom|date=July 2012}} that Dravidian influenced Indic through "shift", whereby native Dravidian speakers learned and adopted Indic languages.{{Citation needed|date=July 2012}} The presence of Dravidian structural features in Old Indo-Aryan is thus plausibly explained, that the majority of early Old Indo-Aryan speakers had a Dravidian mother tongue which they gradually abandoned.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Erdosy|1995|p=18}}&lt;/ref&gt; Even though the innovative traits in Indic could be explained by multiple internal explanations, early Dravidian influence is the only explanation that can account for all of the innovations at once – it becomes a question of [[Occam's razor|explanatory parsimony]]; moreover, early Dravidian influence accounts for several of the innovative traits in Indic better than any internal explanation that has been proposed.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Thomason|Kaufman|1988|pp=141–144}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A pre-Indo-European linguistic [[Stratum (linguistics)#Substratum|substratum]] in the [[Indian subcontinent]] would be a good reason to exclude India as a potential Indo-European homeland.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Bryant|2001|p=76}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, several linguists, all of whom accept the external origin of the Aryan languages on other grounds, are still open to considering the evidence as internal developments rather than the result of substrate influences,&lt;ref&gt;Hamp 1996 and Jamison 1989, as cited in {{Harvcolnb|Bryant|2001|pp=81–82}}&lt;/ref&gt; or as [[Stratum (linguistics)#Adstratum|adstratum]] effects.&lt;ref&gt;Hock 1975/1984/1996 and Tikkanen 1987, as cited in {{Harvcoltxt|Bryant|2001|pp=78–82}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{See also|Indo-European migrations}}

The Sintashta, Andronovo, [[Bactria–Margiana Archaeological Complex|Bactria-Margiana]] and Yaz cultures have been associated with Indo-Iranian migrations in Central Asia. The [[Gandhara grave culture|Gandhara Grave]], [[Cemetery H culture|Cemetery H]], [[Ochre Coloured Pottery culture|Copper Hoard]] and [[Painted Grey Ware culture|Painted Grey Ware]] cultures are candidates for subsequent cultures within south India associated with Indo-Aryan movements. The decline of the Indus Valley Civilisation predates the Indo-Aryan migrations, but archeological data show a cultural continuity in the archeological record. Together with the presence of Dravidian loanwords in the Rigveda, this argues in favor of an interaction between post-Harappan and Indo-Aryan cultures.

===Stages of migrations===
About 6,000 years ago the Indo-Europeans started to spread out from their [[proto-Indo-European homeland]] in Central Eurasia, between the southern Ural Mountains, the North Caucasus, and the Black Sea.{{sfn|Beckwith|2009|p=29}} About 4,000 years ago Indo-European speaking peoples started to migrate out of the Eurasian steppes.{{sfn|Beckwith|2009|p=30, 31}}{{refn|group=note|Steppe herders, archaic Proto-Indo-European speakers, spread into the lower Danube valley as early as 4200–4000 BCE, either causing or taking advantage of the collapse of [[Old Europe (archaeology)|Old Europe]].{{sfn|Anthony|2007|p=133}}}}

====Diffusion from the "Urheimat"====
{{Main|Proto-Indo-European homeland|Kurgan hypothesis|Yamna culture}}

Most scholars regard the middle Volga, which was the location of the [[Samara culture]] (late 6th and early 5th millennium BCE), and the [[Yamna culture]], to be the "Urheimat" of the Indo-Europeans, as described by the [[Kurgan hypothesis]]. From this "Urheimat", Indo-European languages spread throughout the Eurasian steppes between ca. 4,500 and 2,500 BCE, forming the [[Yamna culture]].

====Anthony – multiple migrations====
David Anthony gives an elaborate overview of the sequence of migrations.

The oldest attested Indo-European language is Hittite, which belongs to the oldest written Indo-European languages, the Anatolian branch.{{sfn|Anthony|2007|p=43}} Although the Hittites are placed in the 2nd millennium BCE,{{sfn|Anthony|2007|pp=43–46}} the Anatolian branch seems to predate Proto-Indo-European, and may have developed from an older Pre-Proto-Indo-European ancestor.{{sfn|Anthony|2007|pp=47–48}} If it separated from Proto-Indo-European, it is likely to have done so between 4500 and 3500 BCE.{{sfn|Anthony|2007|p=48}}

A migration of archaic Proto-Indo-European speaking steppe herders into the [[Cucuteni-Trypillian culture|lower Danube valley]] took place about 4200–4000 BCE, either causing or taking advantage of the collapse of [[Old Europe (archaeology)|Old Europe]].{{sfn|Anthony|2007|p=133}}

According to Mallory and Adams, migrations southward founded the Maykop culture (c. 3500–2500 BCE),{{sfn|Mallory|Adams|1997|p=372}} and eastward the Afanasevo culture (c. 3500–2500 BCE),{{sfn|Mallory|Adams|1997|p=4}} which developed into the Tocharians (c. 3700–3300 BCE).{{sfn|Anthony|2007|pp=101, 264–265}}

According to Anthony, between 3100-2800/2600 BCE, a real folk migration of Proto-Indo-European speakers from the Yamna-culture took place toward the west, into the Danube Valley.{{sfn|Anthony|2007|pp=345, 361–367}} These migrations probably split off Pre-Italic, Pre-Celtic and Pre-Germanic from Proto-Indo-European.{{sfn|Anthony|2007|p=344}} According to Anthony, this was followed by a movement north, which split away Baltic-Slavic c. 2800 BCE.{{sfn|Anthony|2007|p=101}} Pre-Armenian split off at the same time.{{sfn|Anthony|2007|p=100}} According to Parpola, this migration is related to the appearance of Indo-European speakers from Europe in Anatolia, and the appearance of Hittite.{{sfn|Parpola|2015|pp=37–38}}

The [[Corded Ware culture]] in Middle Europe (ca. 2900–2450/2350 cal. BCE),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.comp-archaeology.org/CordedWare.htm | last = Baldia | first = Maximilian O | title = The Corded Ware/Single Grave Culture | year = 2006 | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20020131212107/http://www.comp-archaeology.org/CordedWare.htm | archivedate = 31 January 2002 | df = dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; has been associated with some of the languages in the [[Indo-European languages|Indo-European]] family. According to Haak et al. (2015) a massive migration took place from the Eurasian steppes to Central Europe. [[File:Yamna-en.svg|thumb|right|Yamna culture]] This migration is closely associated with the Corded Ware culture.{{sfn|Haak et al.|2015}}&lt;ref group="web" name="MPG-massive migration"&gt;[http://www.mpg.de/9005184/humans-migration-indo-european-languages Mac-Planck Gesellschaft, ''A massive migration from the steppe brought Indo-European languages to Europe'']&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref group="web" name="Nature-EC"&gt;[http://www.nature.com/news/european-languages-linked-to-migration-from-the-east-1.16919 Ewen Callaway (12 February 2015), ''European languages linked to migration from the east.

The Indo-Iranian language and culture emerged in the [[Sintashta culture]] (c. 2100–1800 BCE), where the chariot was invented.{{sfn|Anthony|2007}} Allentoft et al. (2015) found close [[Autosome|autosomal]] genetic relationship between peoples of [[Corded Ware culture]] and Sintashta culture, which "suggests similar genetic sources of the two", and may imply that "the Sintashta derives directly from an eastward migration of Corded Ware peoples".{{sfn|Allentoft|2015}}

The Indo-Iranian language and culture was further developed in the Andronovo culture (c. 1800–1400 BCE), and influenced by the Bactria–Margiana Archaeological Complex (c. 2300–1700 BCE). The Indo-Aryans split off around 1800–1600 BCE from the Iranians,{{sfn|Anthony|2007|p=408}} whereafter Indo-Aryan groups moved to the Levant (Mitanni), northern India (Vedic people, c. 1500 BCE), and China (Wusun).{{sfn|Beckwith|2009}} Thereafter the Iranians migrated into Iran.{{sfn|Beckwith|2009}}

===Central Asia: formation of Indo-Iranians===
Indo-Iranian peoples are a grouping of [[ethnic group]]s consisting of the [[Indo-Aryan peoples|Indo-Aryan]], [[Iranian peoples|Iranian]], [[Dardic People|Dardic]] and [[Nuristanis|Nuristani peoples]]; that is, speakers of [[Indo-Iranian languages]], a major branch of the [[Indo-European languages|Indo-European language family]].

The Proto-Indo-Iranians are commonly identified with the [[Andronovo culture]],{{sfn|Anthony|2009|p=49}} that flourished ca. 1800–1400 BCE in an area of the [[Eurasian Steppe]] that borders the [[Ural River]] on the west, the [[Tian Shan]] on the east. The older [[Sintashta culture]] (2100–1800), formerly included within the Andronovo culture, is now considered separately, but regarded as its predecessor, and accepted as part of the wider Andronovo horizon.

The Indo-Aryan migration was part of the Indo-Iranian migrations from the [[Andronovo culture]] into Anatolia, Iran and South-Asia.{{sfn|Beckwith|2009|p=32}}

====Sintashta-Petrovka culture====
{{Main|Sintashta culture}}
[[File:From Corded Ware to Sintashta.jpg|thumb|right|300px|According to Allentoft (2015), the Sintashta culture probably derived from the Corded Ware Culture.]]
[[File:Andronovo culture.png|thumb|300px|Map of the approximate maximal extent of the Andronovo culture. The formative Sintashta-Petrovka culture is shown in darker red. The location of the earliest [[spoke]]-wheeled [[chariot]] finds is indicated in purple. Adjacent and overlapping cultures ([[Afanasevo culture|Afanasevo]], [[Srubna culture|Srubna]], [[Bactria–Margiana Archaeological Complex|Bactria-Margiana Culture]] are shown in green.]]

The Sintashta culture, also known as the Sintashta-Petrovka culture&lt;ref name="Koryakova 1998b"&gt;{{Harvnb|Koryakova|1998b}}.&lt;/ref&gt; or Sintashta-Arkaim culture,&lt;ref name="Koryakova 1998a"&gt;{{Harvnb|Koryakova|1998a}}.&lt;/ref&gt; is a [[Bronze Age]] [[archaeological culture]] of the northern [[Eurasian Steppe]] on the borders of [[Eastern Europe]] and [[Central Asia]], dated to the period 2100–1800 [[Common Era|BCE]].&lt;ref name="Anthony 2009"&gt;{{Harvnb|Anthony|2009}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The Sintashta culture is probably the archaeological manifestation of the Indo-Iranian language group.{{sfn|Anthony|2009|pp=390 (fig. 15.9), 405–411}}

The Sintashta culture emerged from the interaction of two antecedent cultures. Its immediate predecessor in the Ural-Tobol steppe was the [[Poltavka culture]], an offshoot of the cattle-herding [[Yamna culture|Yamnaya horizon]] that moved east into the region between 2800 and 2600 BCE.&lt;ref name="Anthony 2007 pp. 385-388"&gt;{{Harvnb|Anthony|2007|pp=386–388}}&lt;/ref&gt; Several Sintashta towns were built over older Poltovka settlements or close to Poltovka cemeteries, and Poltovka motifs are common on Sintashta pottery. Sintashta [[material culture]] also shows the influence of the late [[Abashevo culture]], a collection of [[Corded Ware culture|Corded Ware]] settlements in the [[forest steppe]] zone north of the Sintashta region that were also predominantly [[pastoralism|pastoralist]].{{sfn|Anthony|2007|pp=385–388}} Allentoft et al. (2015) also found close [[Autosome|autosomal]] genetic relationship between peoples of [[Corded Ware culture]] and Sintashta culture.{{sfn|Allentoft|2015}}

The earliest known [[chariot]]s have been found in Sintashta burials, and the culture is considered a strong candidate for the origin of the technology, which spread throughout the [[Old World]] and played an important role in [[ancient warfare]].&lt;ref name="Kuznetsov 2006"&gt;{{Harvnb|Kuznetsov|2006}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Sintashta settlements are also remarkable for the intensity of [[copper]] mining and [[bronze]] [[metallurgy]] carried out there, which is unusual for a steppe culture.&lt;ref name="Hanks &amp; Linduff 2009"&gt;{{Harvnb|Hanks|Linduff|2009}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Because of the difficulty of identifying the remains of Sintashta sites beneath those of later settlements, the culture was only recently distinguished from the [[Andronovo culture]].&lt;ref name="Koryakova 1998a" /&gt; It is now recognised as a separate entity forming part of the 'Andronovo horizon'.&lt;ref name="Koryakova 1998b" /&gt;

====Andronovo culture====
{{Main|Andronovo culture}}
[[File:Indo-Iranian origins.png|thumb|right|300px|Archaeological cultures associated with [[Indo-Iranians|Indo-Iranian]] [[Indo-Iranian migration|migrations]] and [[Indo-Aryan peoples|Indo-Aryan]] migrations (after [[Encyclopedia of Indo-European Culture|EIEC]]). The [[Andronovo culture|Andronovo]], [[BMAC]] and [[Yaz culture]]s have often been associated with [[Indo-Iranians|Indo-Iranian]] migrations. The [[Gandhara grave culture|GGC]], [[Cemetery H culture|Cemetery H]], [[Copper Hoard Culture|Copper Hoard]] and [[Painted Grey Ware culture|PGW]] cultures are candidates for cultures associated with [[Indo-Aryan peoples|Indo-Aryan]] migrations.]]

The Andronovo culture is a collection of similar local [[Bronze Age]] [[Indo-Iranians|Indo-Iranian]] cultures that flourished ca. 1800–1400 BCE in western [[Siberia]] and the west [[Asian Steppe|Asiatic steppe]]. It is probably better termed an archaeological complex or [[Horizon (archaeology)|archaeological horizon]]. The name derives from the village of Andronovo ({{coord|55|53|N|55|42|E|}}), where in 1914, several graves were discovered, with skeletons in crouched positions, buried with richly decorated pottery.
The older [[Sintashta culture]] (2100–1800), formerly included within the Andronovo culture, is now considered separately, but regarded as its predecessor, and accepted as part of the wider Andronovo horizon.

Sub-cultures have been distinguished:
*Alakul (1800–1400 BCE)
*Fedorovo (1700–1300 BCE)
*Alekseyevka (1200–1000 BCE)

The geographical extent of the culture is vast and difficult to delineate exactly. On its western fringes, it overlaps with the approximately contemporaneous, but distinct, [[Srubna culture]] in the [[Volga River|Volga]]–[[Ural River|Ural]] interfluvial. To the east, it reaches into the [[Minusinsk]] depression, with some sites as far west as the southern [[Ural Mountains]],&lt;ref name=camhist&gt;{{citation|chapter=Inner Asia at the dawn of history|last=Okladnikov|first=A. P.|title=The Cambridge history of early Inner Asia|year=1994|publisher=Cambridge Univ. Press|location=Cambridge [u.a.]|isbn=978-0-521-24304-9|pages=83}}&lt;/ref&gt; overlapping with the area of the earlier [[Afanasevo culture]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcolnb|Mallory|1989|p=62}}&lt;/ref&gt; Additional sites are scattered as far south as the [[Kopet Dag]] ([[Turkmenistan]]), the [[Pamir Mountains|Pamir]] ([[Tajikistan]]) and the [[Tian Shan]] ([[Kyrgyzstan]]). The northern boundary vaguely corresponds to the beginning of the [[Taiga]].&lt;ref name="camhist" /&gt; In the Volga basin, interaction with the Srubna culture was the most intense and prolonged, and Federovo style pottery is found as far west as [[Volgograd]].

Towards the middle of the 2nd millennium, the Andronovo cultures begin to move intensively eastwards. They mined deposits of [[copper]] ore in the [[Altai Mountains]] and lived in villages of as many as ten sunken log cabin houses measuring up to 30m by 60m in size. Burials were made in stone [[cist]]s or stone enclosures with buried timber chambers.

In other respects, the economy was pastoral, based on [[cattle]], [[horse]]s, [[sheep]], and [[goat]]s.&lt;ref name="camhist" /&gt; While agricultural use has been posited, no clear evidence has been presented.&lt;!-- Image with inadequate rationale removed: [[File:Arqaim.jpg|thumb|300px|[[Arkaim]] in [[Russia]] is believed to have been constructed by Sintashta-Petrovka tribes some 4000 years ago.]] --&gt;

Most researchers associate the Andronovo horizon with early [[Indo-Iranian languages]], though it may have overlapped the early [[Uralic languages|Uralic]]-speaking area at its northern fringe, including the [[Proto-Turkic language|Turkic]]-speaking area at its northeastern fringe.&lt;ref&gt;[http://turkic-languages.scienceontheweb.net/Proto_Turkic_Urheimat.html The Proto-Turkic Urheimat &amp; The Early Migrations of the Turkic Peoples] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131224111409/http://turkic-languages.scienceontheweb.net/Proto_Turkic_Urheimat.html |date=24 December 2013}} (Proto-Bulgaro-Turkic from the archaeological perspective), 2009–2012.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Johanson68"&gt;[[Róna-Tas, András]]. "The Reconstruction of Proto-Turkic and the Genetic Question." In: ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=U1009DRu_vMC The Turkic Languages]'', pp. 67–80. 1998.&lt;/ref&gt;

Based on its use by Indo-Aryans in Mitanni and Vedic India, its prior absence in the Near East and Harappan India, and its 19–20th century BCE attestation at the Andronovo site of [[Sintashta]], Kuzmina (1994) argues that the chariot corroborates the identification of Andronovo as Indo-Iranian. [[Leo Klejn|Klejn]] (1974) and Brentjes (1981) find the Andronovo culture much too late for an Indo-Iranian identification since chariot-wielding Aryans appear in [[Mitanni]] by the 15th to 16th century BCE. However, {{Harvcoltxt|Anthony|Vinogradov|1995}} dated a [[chariot burial]] at [[Krivoye Lake]] to about 2000 BCE and a [[Bactria–Margiana Archaeological Complex|Bactria-Margiana]] burial that also contains a foal has recently been found, indicating further links with the steppes.&lt;ref name ="Bryant chariot origin references"&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Anthony|Vinogradov|1995}}&lt;br /&gt;Kuzmina (1994), Klejn (1974), and Brentjes (1981), as cited in {{Harvcoltxt|Bryant|2001|p=206}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Mallory (as cited in {{Harvcolnb|Bryant|2001|p=216}}) notes the difficulties of making a case for expansions from Andronovo to northern India, and that attempts to link the Indo-Aryans to such sites as the Beshkent and Vakhsh cultures "only gets the [[Indo-Iranians|Indo-Iranian]] to Central Asia, but not as far as the seats of the [[Medes]], Persians or Indo-Aryans". However he has also developed the "kulturkugel" model that has the Indo-Iranians taking over [[Bactria–Margiana Archaeological Complex|Bactria-Margiana]] cultural traits but preserving their language and religion while moving into Iran and India.

====Bactria-Margiana culture====
{{Main|Bactria–Margiana Archaeological Complex}}
[[File:BMAC.png|thumb|300px|The extent of the Bactria-Margiana Culture (after [[Encyclopedia of Indo-European Culture|EIEC]]).]]

The Bactria-Margiana Culture, also called "Bactria-Margiana Archaeological Complex", was a non-Indo-European culture which influenced the Indo-Iranians.{{sfn|Beckwith|2009|p=32}} It was centered in what is nowadays northwestern Afghanistan and southern Turkmenistan.{{sfn|Beckwith|2009|p=32}} Proto-Indo-Iranian arose due to this influence.{{sfn|Beckwith|2009|p=32}}

The Indo-Iranians also borrowed their distinctive religious beliefs and practices from this culture.{{sfn|Beckwith|2009|p=32}} According to Anthony, the Old Indic religion probably emerged among Indo-European immigrants in the contact zone between the [[Zeravshan River]] (present-day Uzbekistan) and (present-day) Iran.{{sfn|Anthony|2007|p=462}} It was "a syncretic mixture of old Central Asian and new Indo-European elements",{{sfn|Anthony|2007|p=462}} which borrowed "distinctive religious beliefs and practices"{{sfn|Beckwith|2009|p=32}} from the [[Bactria–Margiana Archaeological Complex|Bactria–Margiana Culture]].{{sfn|Beckwith|2009|p=32}} At least 383 non-Indo-European words were borrowed from this culture, including the god [[Indra]] and the ritual drink [[Soma (drink)|Soma]].{{sfn|Anthony|2007|pp=454–455}}

The characteristically [[Bactria–Margiana Archaeological Complex|Bactria-Margiana]] (southern [[Turkmenistan]]/northern [[Afghanistan]]) artifacts found at burials in [[Mehrgarh]] and [[Balochistan]] are explained by a movement of peoples from Central Asia to the south.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcolnb|Allchin|1995|pp=47–48}}&lt;br /&gt;Hiebert &amp; Lamberg-Karlovsky (1992), Kohl (1984), and Parpola (1994), as cited in {{Harvcoltxt|Bryant|2001|p=215}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Indo-Aryan tribes may have been present in the area of the BMAC from 1700 BCE at the latest (incidentally corresponding with the decline of that culture).

From the BMAC, the Indo-Aryans moved into the [[Indian subcontinent]]. According to Bryant, the [[Bactria–Margiana Archaeological Complex|Bactria-Margiana]] material inventory of the Mehrgarh and Baluchistan burials is "evidence of an archaeological intrusion into the subcontinent from Central Asia during the commonly accepted time frame for the arrival of the Indo-Aryans".{{sfn|Bryant|2001|p=215}}{{refn|group=note|Nevertheless, archaeologists like B.B. Lal have seriously questioned the [[Bactria–Margiana Archaeological Complex|Bactria-Margiana]] and Indo-Iranian "connections", and thoroughly disputed all the proclaimed relations.&lt;ref group=web&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.archaeologyonline.net/artifacts/19th-century-paradigms.html|title=To Revert to the Theory of 'Aryan Invasion' (Part 1)|last=admin|date=29 April 2014|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

===Two waves of Indo-Iranian migration===
{{See also|Indo-Iranians}}
The Indo-Iranian migrations took place in two waves,{{sfn|Burrow|1973}}{{sfn|Parpola|1999}} belonging to the second and the third stage of Beckwith's description of the Indo-European migrations.{{sfn|Beckwith|2009|pp=32–34}} The first wave consisted of the Indo-Aryan migration into the Levant, founding the [[Mitanni]] kingdom in northern Syria{{sfn|Anthony|2007|p=454}} (ca.1500–1300 BCE), and the migration south-eastward of the Vedic people, over the Hindu Kush into northern India.{{sfn|Beckwith|2009|p=33 note 20}} [[Christopher I. Beckwith]] suggests that the [[Wusun]], an [[Proto-Indo-Europeans|Indo-European]] [[Caucasian race|Europoid]] people of [[Inner Asia]] in [[Ancient history|antiquity]], were also of Indo-Aryan origin.{{sfn|Beckwith|2009|pp=376–377}} The second wave is interpreted as the Iranian wave.{{sfn|Mallory|1989|pp=42–43}}

===First wave – Indo-Aryan migrations===
====Mittani====
[[File:Near East 1400 BCE.png|thumb|260px|Map of the Near East ca. 1400 BCE showing the Kingdom of Mitanni at its greatest extent]]
{{Main|Mitanni}}
''Mitanni'' ([[Hittite cuneiform]] {{transl|hit|[[KUR]]&lt;sup&gt;[[Cities of the ancient Near East|URU]]&lt;/sup&gt;''Mi-ta-an-ni''}}), also ''Mittani'' ({{transl|hit|Mi-it-ta-ni}}) or ''Hanigalbat'' ([[Assyria]]n ''Hanigalbat, Khanigalbat'' cuneiform ''{{transl|akk|Ḫa-ni-gal-bat}}'') or ''Naharin'' in ancient Egyptian texts was a [[Hurrian language|Hurrian]]-speaking state in northern [[Syria]] and south-east [[Anatolia]] from ca. 1500 BCE–1300 BCE.

Founded by an [[Indo-Aryan peoples|Indo-Aryan]] ruling class governing a predominately [[Hurrians|Hurrian]] population, Mitanni came to be a regional power after the Hittite destruction of [[Amorites|Amorite]]&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |title = The Kingdom of the Hittites |first=Trevor |last=Bryce |publisher = Oxford University Press | year = 2005 | page = 98}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[First Babylonian Dynasty|Babylon]] and a series of ineffectual [[Assyria]]n kings created a power vacuum in Mesopotamia. At the beginning of its history, Mitanni's major rival was Egypt under the [[Eighteenth Dynasty of Egypt|Thutmosids]]. However, with the ascent of the [[Hittites|Hittite]] empire, Mitanni and Egypt made an alliance to protect their mutual interests from the threat of Hittite domination.

At the height of its power, during the 14th century BCE, Mitanni had outposts centered on its capital, [[Washukanni]], whose location has been determined by archaeologists to be on the headwaters of the [[Khabur (Euphrates)|Khabur River]]. Their sphere of influence is shown in Hurrian place names, personal names and the spread through Syria and the [[Levant]] of a distinct pottery type. Eventually, Mitanni succumbed to Hittite and later Assyrian attacks, and was reduced to the status of a province of the [[Middle Assyrian Empire]].

The earliest written evidence for an [[Indo-Aryan languages|Indo-Aryan language]] is found not in Northwestern India and Pakistan, but in northern Syria, the location of the Mitanni kingdom.{{sfn|Anthony|2007|p=49}} The Mitanni kings took Old Indic throne names, and Old Indic technical terms were used for horse-riding and chariot-driving.{{sfn|Anthony|2007|p=49}} The Old Indic term [[Ṛta|r'ta]], meaning "cosmic order and truth", the central concept of the Rigveda, was also employed in the Mitanni kingdom.{{sfn|Anthony|2007|p=49}} Old Indic gods, including [[Indra]], were also known in the Mitanni kingdom.{{sfn|Anthony|2007|p=50}}{{sfn|Flood|2008|p=68}}{{sfn|Melton|Baumann|2010|p=1412}}

=====Migration into northern India=====
[[File:Rigvedic geography.jpg|thumb|320px|Geography of the Rigveda, with [[Rigvedic rivers|river names]]; the extent of the [[Swat culture|Swat]] and Cemetery H cultures are indicated.]]
The standard model for the entry of the Indo-European languages into India is that Indo-Aryan migrants went over the [[Hindu Kush]], forming the [[Gandhara grave culture]] or Swat culture, in present-day [[Swat District|Swat valley]], into the headwaters of either the [[Indus River|Indus]] or the [[Ganges]] (probably both). The [[Gandhara grave culture]], which emerged c. 1600 BCE, and flourished from c. 1500 BCE to 500 BCE in Gandhara, modern-day Pakistan and Afghanistan, is thus the most likely locus of the earliest bearers of Rigvedic culture.

Based on this Parpola postulates a first wave of immigration from as early as 1900 BCE, corresponding to the [[Cemetery H culture]], and an immigration to the Punjab ca. 1700–1400 BCE.{{sfn|Parpola|1998}}{{refn|group=note|However, this culture may also represent forerunners of the Indo-Iranians, similar to the [[Lullubi]] and Kassite invasion of Mesopotamia early in the second millennium BCE.{{citation needed|date=October 2013}}}}

According to Kochhar there were three waves of Indo-Aryan immigration that occurred after the mature Harappan phase:{{sfn|Kochhar|2000|pp=185–186}}
# the "Murghamu" ([[Bactria–Margiana Archaeological Complex|Bactria-Margiana Culture]]) related people who entered [[Balochistan]] at Pirak, Mehrgarh south cemetery, and other places, and later merged with the post-urban Harappans during the late Harappans Jhukar phase (2000–1800 BCE);
# the Swat IV that co-founded the Harappan Cemetery H phase in Punjab (2000–1800 BCE);
# and the Rigvedic Indo-Aryans of Swat V that later absorbed the Cemetery H people and gave rise to the [[Painted Grey Ware culture]] (PGW) (to 1400 BCE).

=====Gandhara grave culture=====
{{Main|Gandhara grave culture}}
About 1800 BCE, there is a major cultural change in the [[Swat District|Swat Valley]] with the emergence of the [[Gandhara grave culture]]. With its introduction of new ceramics, new burial rites, and the horse, the [[Gandhara]] grave culture is a major candidate for early Indo-Aryan presence. The two new burial rites—flexed inhumation in a pit and cremation burial in an urn—were, according to early Vedic literature, both practiced in early Indo-Aryan society. Horse-trappings indicate the importance of the horse to the economy of the Gandharan grave culture. Two horse burials indicate the importance of the horse in other respects. Horse burial is a custom that Gandharan grave culture has in common with Andronovo, though not within the distinctive timber-frame graves of the steppe.&lt;ref name = M1989&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Mallory|1989}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=====Spread of Vedic-Brahmanic culture=====

====Indus Valley Civilization====
The Indo-Aryan migration into the northern [[Punjab (region)|Punjab]] started shortly after the decline of the [[Indus Valley Civilisation]] (IVC). According to the "Aryan Invasion Theory" this decline was caused by "invasions" of barbaric and violent Aryans who conquered the IVC. This "Aryan Invasion Theory" is not supported by the archeological and genetic data, and is not representative of the "Indo-Aryan migration theory".

The decline of the IVC from about 1900 BCE started before the onset of the Indo-Aryan migrations. A regional cultural discontinuity occurred during the second millennium BCE and many Indus Valley cities were abandoned during this period, while many new settlements began to appear in [[Gujarat]] and East Punjab and other settlements such as in the western [[Bahawalpur]] region increased in size.

[[Jim G. Shaffer]] and Lichtenstein contend that in the second millennium BCE considerable "location processes" took place. In the eastern Punjab 79.9% and in [[Gujarat]] 96% of sites changed settlement status. According to Shaffer &amp; Lichtenstein,
{{quote|It is evident that a major geographic population shift accompanied this 2nd millennium BCE localisation process. This shift by Harappan and, perhaps, other Indus Valley cultural mosaic groups, is the only archaeologically documented west-to-east movement of human populations in the [[Indian subcontinent]] before the first half of the first millennium B.C.{{sfn|Erdosy|1995|p=139}}}}

=====Continuity=====
According to Erdosy, the ancient Harappans were not markedly different from modern populations in Northwestern India and present-day Pakistan. Craniometric data showed similarity with prehistoric peoples of the Iranian plateau and Western Asia,{{refn|group=note|Comparing the [[Harappa]]n and [[Gandhara]] cultures, Kennedy states: "Our multivariate approach does not define the biological identity of an ancient Aryan population, but it does indicate that the Indus Valley and [[Gandhara]] peoples shared a number of craniometric, odontometric and discrete traits that point to a high degree of biological affinity." Kennedy in {{harvnb|Erdosy|1995|p=49}}}} although [[Mohenjo-daro]] was distinct from the other areas of the Indus Valley.{{refn|group=note|[[Kenneth A. R. Kennedy|Kennedy]]: "Have Aryans been identified in the prehistoric skeletal record from South Asia? Biological anthropology and concepts of ancient races", in {{harvnb|Erdosy|1995}} at p. 49.}}{{refn|group=note|Cephalic measures, however, may not be a good indicator as they do not necessarily indicate ethnicity and they might vary in different environments. On the use of which, however, see {{sfn|Holloway|2002}}}}

According to Kennedy, there is no evidence of "demographic disruptions" after the decline of the Harappa culture.{{sfn|Erdosy|1995|p=54}}{{refn|group=note|Kennedy: "there is no evidence of demographic disruptions in the north-western sector of the [[Subcontinent]] during and immediately after the decline of the [[Harappa]]n culture. If [[Vedic Aryans]] were a biological entity represented by the skeletons from Timargarha, then their biological features of cranial and dental anatomy were not distinct to a marked degree from what we encountered in the ancient Harappans." Kennedy in {{harvnb|Erdosy|1995|p=54}}}} Kenoyer notes that no biological evidence can be found for major new populations in post-Harappan communities.{{sfn|Bryant|2001|p=231}}{{refn|group=note|Kenoyer: "there was an overlap between Late [[Harappa]]n and post-Harappan communities...with no biological evidence for major new populations." Kenoyer as quoted in {{harvnb|Bryant|2001|p=231}}}} Hemphill notes that "patterns of phonetic affinity" between [[Bactria]] and the Indus Valley Civilisation are best explained by "a pattern of long-standing, but low-level bidirectional mutual exchange".{{refn|group=note|Hemphill: "the data provide no support for any model of massive migration and gene flow between the oases of [[Bactria]] and the Indus Valley. Rather, patterns of phonetic affinity best conform to a pattern of long-standing, but low-level bidirectional mutual exchange. "Hemphill 1998 "Biological Affinities and Adaptations of Bronze Age Bactrians: III. An initial craniometric assessment", ''[[American Journal of Physical Anthropology]]'', 106, 329–348.; Hemphill 1999 "Biological Affinities and Adaptations of Bronze Age Bactrians: III. A Craniometric Investigation of Bactrian Origins", American Journal of Physical Anthropology, 108, 173–192}}

According to Kennedy, the [[Cemetery H culture]] "shows clear biological affinities" with the earlier population of Harappa.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Kennedy|2000|p=312}}; {{harvnb|Mallory|Adams|1997|pp=103, 310}}&lt;/ref&gt; The archaeologist Kenoyer noted that this culture "may only reflect a change in the focus of settlement organization from that which was the pattern of the earlier Harappan phase and not cultural discontinuity, urban decay, invading aliens, or site abandonment, all of which have been suggested in the past."&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Kenoyer|1991b|p=56}}&lt;/ref&gt; Recent excavations in 2008 at Alamgirpur, Meerut District, appeared to show an overlap between the Harappan and PGW pottery&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Ravindra N Singh, et al. (2014)|Recent Excavations at Alamgirpur, Meerut District: A Preliminary Report}}[https://www.academia.edu/8246061/Received_Recent_Excavations_at_Alamgirpur_Meerut_District_A_Preliminary_Report_Indian_Society_for_Prehistoric_and_Quaternary_Studies]&lt;/ref&gt; indicating cultural continuity.

=====Relation with Indo-Aryan migrations=====
According to Kenoyer, the decline of the Indus Valley Civilisation is not explained by Aryan migrations,{{sfn|Bryant|2001|p=190}}{{refn|group=note|Kenoyer: "Although the overall socioeconomic organization changed, continuities in [[technology]], subsistence practices, settlement organization, and some regional [[symbols]] show that the indigenous population was not displaced by invading hordes of [[Indo-Aryan languages|Indo-Aryan]] speaking people. For many years, the 'invasions' or 'migrations' of these Indo-Aryan-speaking Vedic/Aryan tribes explained the decline of the Indus civilization and the sudden rise of urbanization in the [[Ganges]]-[[Yamuna]] valley. This was based on simplistic models of culture change and an uncritical reading of Vedic texts...",{{sfn|Bryant|2001|p=190}}}} which took place after the decline of the Indus Valley Civilisation. Yet, according to Erdosy,
{{quote|Evidence in material culture for systems collapse, abandonment of old beliefs and large-scale, if localised, population shifts in response to ecological catastrophe in the 2nd millennium B.C. must all now be related to the spread of Indo-Aryan languages.{{sfn|Erdosy|1995|p=5}}}}

Erdosy, testing hypotheses derived from linguistic evidence against hypotheses derived from archaeological data,{{sfn|Erdosy|1995|p=24}} states that there is no evidence of "invasions by a barbaric race enjoying technological and military superiority",{{sfn|Erdosy|1995|p=23}} but "some support was found in the archaeological record for small-scale migrations from Central Asia to the [[Indian subcontinent]] in the late 3rd/early 2nd millennia BCE".{{sfn|Erdosy|1995}} According to Erdosy, the postulated movements within Central Asia can be placed within a processional framework, replacing simplistic concepts of "diffusion", "migrations" and "invasions".{{sfn|Erdosy|1995|pp=5–6}}

Some scholars have argued that the historical [[Vedic period#Culture|Vedic culture]] is the result of an amalgamation of the immigrating Indo-Aryans with the remnants of the indigenous civilization, such as the [[Ochre Coloured Pottery culture]]. Such remnants of IVC culture are not prominent in the [[Rigveda]], with its focus on chariot warfare and nomadic pastoralism in stark contrast with an urban civilization.

====Inner Asia – Wusun and Yuezhi====
=====Wusun and Yuezhi=====
[[File:Tarimrivermap.png|thumb|right|The Tarim Basin, 2008]]
[[File:Wu-sun Lage.png|thumb|right|Wusun and their neighbours during the late 2nd century BCE, take note that the Yancai did not change their name to [[Alans]] until the 1st century.]]
[[File:Yueh-ChihMigrations.jpg|thumb|right|The migrations of the Yuezhi through Central Asia, from around 176&amp;nbsp;BCE to 30&amp;nbsp;CE]]
{{Main|Wusun|Yuezhi}}

According to [[Christopher I. Beckwith]] the [[Wusun]], an [[Proto-Indo-Europeans|Indo-European]] [[Caucasian race|Caucasian]] people of [[Inner Asia]] in [[Ancient history|antiquity]], were also of Indo-Aryan origin.{{sfn|Beckwith|2009|pp=376–377}} From the [[Chinese language|Chinese]] term Wusun, Beckwith reconstructs the [[Old Chinese]] *âswin, which he compares to the [[Indo-Aryan languages|Old Indic]] aśvin "the horsemen", the name of the [[Rigvedic deities|Rigvedic]] [[Ashvins|twin equestrian gods]].{{sfn|Beckwith|2009|pp=376–377}} Beckwith suggests that the Wusun were an eastern remnant of the Indo-Aryans, who had been suddenly pushed to the extremeties of the [[Eurasian Steppe]] by the [[Iranian peoples]] in the 2nd millennium BCE.{{sfn|Beckwith|2009|pp=29–38}}

The Wusun are first mentioned by Chinese sources as vassals in the [[Tarim Basin]] of the [[Yuezhi]],{{sfn|Beckwith|2009|pp=84–85}} another Indo-European Caucasian people of possible [[Tocharians|Tocharian]] stock.{{sfn|Loewe|Shaughnessy|1999|p=83–88}}&lt;ref name="Beckwith380"&gt;{{harvnb|Beckwith|2009|pp=380–383}}&lt;/ref&gt; Around 175 BCE, the Yuezhi were utterly defeated by the [[Xiongnu]], also former vassals of the Yuezhi.&lt;ref name="Beckwith380"/&gt;&lt;ref name="ChineseHistory"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.chinaknowledge.de/History/Altera/wusun.html |title=Chinese History – Wusun 烏孫 |last1= |first1= |last2= |first2= |date= |website=Chinaknowledge |publisher= |accessdate=1 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Yuezhi subsequently attacked the Wusun and killed their king (Kunmo {{zh|昆莫}} or Kunmi {{zh|昆彌}}) Nandoumi ({{zh|難兜靡}}), capturing the [[Ili River|Ili Valley]] from the [[Saka]] ([[Scythians]]) shortly afterwards.&lt;ref name="ChineseHistory"/&gt; In return the Wusun settled in the former territories of the Yuezhi as vassals of the Xiongnu.&lt;ref name="ChineseHistory"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Beckwith6"&gt;{{harvnb|Beckwith|2009|pp=6–7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The son of Nandoumi was adopted by the Xiongnu king and made leader of the Wusun.&lt;ref name="Beckwith6"/&gt; Around 130 BCE he attacked and utterly defeated the Yuezhi, settling the Wusun in the Ili Valley.&lt;ref name="Beckwith6"/&gt; After the Yuezhi were defeated by the [[Xiongnu]], in the 2nd century BCE, a small group, known as the Little Yuezhi, fled to the south, while the majority migrated west to the Ili Valley, where they displaced the Sakas (Scythians). Driven from the Ili Valley shortly afterwards by the Wusun, the Yuezhi migrated to [[Sogdia]] and then [[Bactria]], where they are often identified with the ''Tókharoi'' (Τοχάριοι) and ''[[Asii]]'' of Classical sources. They then expanded into northern [[Indian subcontinent]], where one branch of the Yuezhi founded the [[Kushan Empire]]. The Kushan empire stretched from [[Turpan]] in the Tarim Basin to [[Pataliputra]] on the [[Indo-Gangetic Plain]] at its greatest extent, and played an important role in the development of the [[Silk Road]] and the [[Silk Road transmission of Buddhism|transmission of Buddhism]] to [[China]].

Soon after 130 BCE the Wusun became independent of the Xiongnu, becoming trusted vassals of the [[Han dynasty]] and powerful force in the region for centuries.&lt;ref name="Beckwith6"/&gt; With the emerging steppe federations of the [[Rouran Khaganate|Rouran]], the Wusun migrated into the [[Pamir Mountains]] in the 5th century CE.&lt;ref name="ChineseHistory"/&gt; They are last mentioned in 938 when a Wusun chieftain paid tribute to the [[Liao dynasty]].&lt;ref name="ChineseHistory"/&gt;

===Second wave – Iranians===
The first Iranians to reach the [[Black Sea]] may have been the [[Cimmerians]] in the 8th century BCE, although their linguistic affiliation is uncertain. They were followed by the [[Scythians]], whom would dominate the area, at their height, from the [[Carpathian Mountains]] in the west, to the eastern-most fringes of [[Central Asia]] in the east. For most of their existence, they were based in what is modern-day Ukraine and southern European [[Russia]]. [[Sarmatians|Sarmatian]] tribes, of whom the best known are the [[Roxolani]] (Rhoxolani), [[Iazyges]] (Jazyges) and the [[Alans]], followed the Scythians westwards into Europe in the late centuries BCE and the 1st and 2nd centuries of the Common Era (The [[Migration Period]]). The populous Sarmatian tribe of the [[Massagetae]], dwelling near the Caspian Sea, were known to the early rulers of Persia in the Achaemenid Period. In the east, the Saka occupied several areas in Xinjiang, from Khotan to Tumshuq.

The [[Medes]], [[Parthia]]ns and [[Persian people|Persians]] begin to appear on the western [[Iranian Plateau]] from c. 800 BCE, after which they remained under [[Assyria]]n rule for several centuries, as it was with the rest of the peoples in the [[Near East]]. The [[Achaemenid Empire|Achaemenids]] replaced Median rule from 559 BCE. Around the first millennium of the [[Common Era]] (AD), the [[Kambojas]], the [[Pashtuns]] and the [[Baloch people|Baloch]] began to settle on the eastern edge of the Iranian Plateau, on the mountainous frontier of northwestern and western [[Pakistan]], displacing the earlier [[Indo-Aryan peoples|Indo-Aryans]] from the area.

In Central Asia, the [[Turkic languages]] have marginalized [[Iranian languages]] as a result of the [[Turkic migration]] of the early centuries CE. In Eastern Europe, [[Slavs|Slavic]] and [[Germanic peoples]] assimilated and absorbed the native Iranian languages (Scythian and Sarmatian) of the region. Extant major Iranian languages are [[Persian language|Persian]], [[Pashto]], [[Kurdish languages|Kurdish]], and [[Balochi language|Balochi]], besides numerous smaller ones.

==Anthropology: elite recruitment and language change==
{{See also|Language shift}}

===Elite dominance===
Small groups can change a larger cultural area,{{sfn|Witzel|2005|p=347}}{{sfn|Anthony|2007}} and elite male dominance by small groups may have led to a language shift in northern India.{{sfn|Basu et al.|2003|p=2287}}{{sfn|Anthony|2007|pp=117–118}}{{sfn|Pereltsvaig|Lewis|2015|pp=208–215}}{{refn|group=note|Basu et al. (2003) refer to Renfrew (1992), ''Archaeology, genetics and linguistic diversity'', stating: "Renfrew (1992) has suggested that the elite dominance model, which envisages the intrusion of a relatively small but well-organized group that takes over an existing system by the use of force, may be appropriate to explain the distribution of the IE languages in north India and Pakistan."{{sfn|Basu et al.|2003|p=2287}} Anthony explains that small elite groups may effect significant social changes because their social organisation allows for the recruitment of new members via patronage-systems, which may be attractive for outsiders.{{sfn|Anthony|2007|pp=117–118}}{{sfn|Pereltsvaig|Lewis|2015|pp=208–215}}}} According to Parpola, local elites joined "small but powerful groups" of Indo-European speaking migrants.{{sfn|Parpola|2015|p=67}} These migrants had an attractive social system and good weapons, and luxury goods which marked their status and power. Joining these groups was attractive for local leaders, since it strengthened their position, and gave them additional advantages.{{sfn|Parpola|2015|pp=67–68}} These new members were further incorporated by [[Marriage|matrimonial]] alliances.{{sfn|Parpola|2015|p=68}}{{sfn|Mallory|2002}}

===Renfrew: models of "linguistic replacement"===
Basu et al. refer to Renfrew, who described four models for "linguistic replacement":{{sfn|Basu et al.|2003|p=2287}}{{sfn|Renfrew|1992|pp=453–454}}
# The demographic-subsistence model, exemplified by the process of agricultural dispersal, in which the incoming group has exploitive technologies which makes them dominant. It may lead to significant gene flow, and significant genetic changes in the population. But it may also lead to acculturalisation, in which case the technologies are taken over, but there is less change in the genetic composition of the population;
# The existence of extended trading systems which lead to the development of a lingua franca, in which case some gene flow is to be expected;
# The elite dominance model, in which "a relatively small but well-organized group [...] take[s] over the system".{{sfn|Renfrew|1992|p=454}} Given the small size of the elite, its genetic influence may also be small, though "preferential access to marriage partners" may result in a relatively strong influence on the gene pool. Sexual asymmetry may also be of influence: incoming elites often consist mostly of males, who have no influence on the mitochondrial DNA of the gene pool, but may influence the Y chromosomes of the gene pool;
# System collapse, in which territorial boundaries are changed, and elite dominance may appear for a while.

===David Anthony: elite recruitment===
David Anthony, in his "revised Steppe hypothesis"{{sfn|Pereltsvaig|Lewis|2015|p=205}} notes that the spread of the Indo-European languages probably did not happen through "chain-type folk migrations", but by the introduction of these languages by ritual and political elites, which are emulated by large groups of people.{{sfn|Anthony|2007|p=117}}{{refn|group=note|name="Anthony_Language_shift"|David Anthony (1995): "Language shift can be understood best as a social strategy through which individuals and groups compete for positions of prestige, power, and domestic security [...] What is important, then, is not just dominance, but vertical social mobility and a linkage between language and access to positions of prestige and power [...] A relatively small immigrant elite population can encourage widespread language shift among numerically dominant indigenes in a non-state or pre-state context if the elite employs a specific combination of encouragements and punishments. Ethnohistorical cases [...] demonstrate that small elite groups have successfully imposed their languages in non-state situations."{{sfn|Witzel|2001|p=27}}}}{{refn|group=note|Compare the process of [[Sanskritization]] in India.}} Anthony gives the example of the Luo-speaking Acholi in northern Uganda in the 17th and 18th century, whose language spread rapidly in the 19th century.{{sfn|Anthony|2007|pp=117–118}} Anthony notes that "Indo-European languages probably spread in a similar way among the tribal societies of prehistoric Europe", carried forward by "Indo-European chiefs" and their "ideology of political clientage".{{sfn|Anthony|2007|p=118}} Anthony notes that "elite recruitment" may be a suitable term for this system.{{sfn|Anthony|2007|p=118}}{{refn|group=note|Another example Anthony gives of how an open social system can encourage recruitment and language shift, are the Pathans in western Afghanistan. Traditionally status depended on agricultural surpluses and landownership. The neighbouring Baluch, outnumbered by the Pathans, were pastoral herders, and has hierarchical political system. Pathans who lost their land, could take refuge among the Baluch. As Anthony notes, "chronic tribal warfare might generally favor pastoralism over sedentary economics as herds can be defended by moving them, whereas agricultural fields are an immobile target."{{sfn|Anthony|2007|pp=118–119}}}}

===Michael Witzel: small groups and acculturation===
Michael Witzel refers to Ehret’s model{{refn|group=note|Michael Witzel: Ehret, Ch., 1988. "Language Change and the Material Correlates of Language and Ethnic Shift," Antiquity, 62: 564–74; derived from Africa, cf. Diakonoff 1985.{{sfn|Witzel|2005|p=347}}}} "which stresses the [[osmosis]], or a 'billiard ball', or Mallory's ''Kulturkugel'', effect of cultural transmission".{{sfn|Witzel|2005|p=347}} According to Ehret, ethnicity and language can shift with relative ease in small societies, due to the cultural, economic and military choices made by the local population in question. The group bringing new traits may initially be small, contributing features that can be fewer in number than those of the already local culture. The emerging combined group may then initiate a recurrent, expansionist process of ethnic and language shift.{{sfn|Witzel|2005|p=347}}

Witzel notes that "arya/ārya does not mean a particular 'people' or even a particular 'racial' group but all those who had joined the tribes speaking Vedic Sanskrit and adhering to their cultural norms (such as ritual, poetry, etc.)."{{sfn|Witzel|2001|p=21}} According to Witzel, "there must have been a long period of acculturation between the local population and the 'original' immigrants speaking Indo-Aryan."{{sfn|Witzel|2001|p=21}} Witzel also notes that the speakers of Indo-Aryan and the local population must have been bilingual, speaking each other's languages and interacting with each other, before the Rg Veda was composed in the Punjab.{{sfn|Witzel|2001|p=22}}

===Salmons: systematic changes in community structure===
Joseph Salmons notes that Anthony presents scarce concrete evidence or arguments.{{sfn|Salmons|2015|p=116}} Salmons is critical about the notion of "prestige" as a central factor in the shift to Indo-European languages, referring to Milroy who notes that "prestige" is "a cover term for a variety of very distinct notions".{{sfn|Salmons|2015|p=116}} Instead, Milroy offers "arguments built around network structure", though Salmons also notes that Anthony includes several of those arguments, "including political and technological advantages".{{sfn|Salmons|2015|p=116}} According to Salmons, the best model is offered by Fishman,{{refn|group=note|Joshua Fisfman (1991), ''Reversing language shift''}} who
{{quote|... understands shift in terms of geographical, social, and cultural "dislocation" of language communities. Social dislocation, to give the most relevant example, involves "siphoning off the talented, the enterprising, the imaginative and the creative" ([Fishman] 1991: 61), and sounds strikingly like Anthony's 'recruitment' scenario.{{sfn|Salmons|2015|p=118}}}}

Salmons himself argues that
{{quote|... systematic changes in community structure are what drive language shift, incorporating Milroy's network structures as well. The heart of the view is the quintessential element of modernization, namely a shift from local community-internal organization to regional (state or national or international, in modern settings), extra-community organizations. Shift correlates with this move from pre-dominantly "horizontal" community structures to more "vertical" ones.{{sfn|Salmons|2015|p=118}}{{refn|group=note|name="dislocation"|Note the dislocation of the [[Indus Valley Civilisation]] prior to the start of the Indo-Aryan migrations into northern India, and the onset of [[Sanskritisation]] with the rise of the [[Kuru Kingdom]], as described by Michael Witzel.{{sfn|Witzel|1995}} Note also that the "Ancestral North Indians" and "Ancestral South Indians"{{sfn|Metspalu et al.|2011}}{{sfn|Reich et al.|2009}} mixed between 4,200 to 1,900 years ago (2200 BCE-100 CE), whereafter a shift to endogamy took place.{{sfn|Moorjani et al.|2013}}}}}}

==Genetics: ancient ancestry and multiple gene flows==
{{See also|Genetics and archaeogenetics of South Asia|Peopling of India}}

India has one of the most genetically diverse populations in the world, and the history of this genetic diversity is the topic of continued research and debate. The Indo-Aryan migrations form part of a complex genetical puzzle on the origin and spread of the various components of the Indian population, including various waves of admixture and language shift. The genetic impact of the Indo-Aryans may have been marginal, but this is not at odds with the cultural and linguistic influence, since language shift is possible without a change in genetics.&lt;ref name="Chaubey2008"&gt;Gyaneshwer Chaubey et al. (2008), ''Language Shift by Indigenous Population: A Model Genetic Study in South Asia'', Int J Hum Genet, 8(1–2): 41–50 (2008) [https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Gyaneshwer_Chaubey/publication/215523811_Language_shift_by_indigenous_population_a_model_genetic_study_in_South_Asia/links/09e41508a88bdd2dde000000.pdf pdf]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Ancestral groups===
====Common maternal ancestry====
{{harvtxt|Sahoo et al.|2006}} states that "there is general agreement that Indian caste and tribal populations share a common late Pleistocene maternal ancestry in India."

{{harvtxt|Kivisild et al.|1999}} concluded that there is "an extensive deep late Pleistocene genetic link between contemporary Europeans and Indians" via the [[mitochondrial DNA]], that is, DNA which is inherited from the mother. According to them, the two groups split at the time of the peopling of Asia and Eurasia and before modern humans entered Europe.{{sfn|Kivisild et al.|1999}} Kivisild et al. (2000) note that "the sum of any recent (the last 15,000 years) western mtDNA gene flow to India comprises, in average, less than 10 percent of the contemporary Indian mtDNA lineages."&lt;ref group=web name="Kivisild2000"&gt;[http://www.archaeologyonline.net/artifacts/Kivisild2000.pdf Kivisild et al. (2000), ''An Indian Ancestry'', p.271] (referring to Kivisild et al. (1999), "Deep common ancestry")&lt;/ref&gt;

{{harvtxt|Kivisild et al.|2003}} and {{harvtxt|Sharma|2005}} note that north and south Indians share a common maternal ancenstry: Kivisild et al. (2003) further note that "these results show that Indian tribal and caste populations derive largely from the same genetic heritage of Pleistocene southern and western Asians and have received limited gene flow from external regions since the Holocene.{{sfn|Kivisild et al.|2003}}

===="Ancestral North Indians" and "Ancestral South Indians"====
{{harvtxt|Reich et al.|2009}}, in a collaborative effort between the [[Harvard Medical School]] and the [[Centre for Cellular and Molecular Biology]] (CCMB), examined the entire genomes worth 560,000 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), as compared to 420 SNPs in prior work. They also cross-compared them with the genomes of other regions available in the global genome database.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Chakravarti |first=Aravinda |title=Tracing India's invisible lthreads |newspaper=Nature (News &amp; Views) |date=24 September 2009 |url=http://genepath.med.harvard.edu/~reich/Press/2009_Nature_India_Chakravarti_News_and_Views.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; Through this study, they were able to discern two genetic groups in the majority of populations in India, which they called "Ancestral North Indians" (ANI) and "Ancestral South Indians" (ASI).&lt;ref group=note&gt;{{harvtxt|Reich et al.|2009}} excluded the [[Austro-Asiatic languages|Austro-Asiatic]] and [[Tibeto-Burman languages|Tibeto-Burman]] speakers from their analysis in order to avoid interference.&lt;/ref&gt; They found that the ANI genes are close to those of Middle Easterners, Central Asians and Europeans whereas the ASI genes are dissimilar to all other known populations outside India.{{refn|group=note|{{harvtxt|Reich et al.|2009}}: "We analyze 25 diverse groups to provide strong evidence for two ancient populations, genetically divergent, that are ancestral to most Indians today. One, the "Ancestral North Indians" (ANI), is genetically close to Middle Easterners, Central Asians, and Europeans, while the other, the "Ancestral South Indians" (ASI), is as distinct from ANI and East Asians as they are from each other."}}{{refn|group=note|{{harvtxt|Moorjani et al.|2013}}: "Most Indian groups descend from a mixture of two genetically divergent populations: Ancestral North Indians (ANI) related to Central Asians, Middle Easterners, Caucasians, and Europeans; and Ancestral South Indians (ASI) not closely related to groups outside the subcontinent."}} These two distinct groups, which had split ca. 50,000 years ago, formed the basis for the present population of India.&lt;ref group=web name="Dolgin"&gt;[http://www.nature.com/news/2009/090922/full/news.2009.935.html Elie Dolgin (2009), ''Indian ancestry revealed. The mixing of two distinct lineages led to most modern-day Indians'', Nature News]&lt;/ref&gt;

The two groups mixed between 1,900 and 4,200 years ago (100 CE-2200 BCE), where-after a shift to endogamy took place and admixture became rare.{{refn|group=note|{{harvtxt|Moorjani et al.|2013}}: "We report genome-wide data from 73 groups from the Indian subcontinent and analyze linkage disequilibrium to estimate ANI-ASI mixture dates ranging from about 1,900 to 4,200 years ago. In a subset of groups, 100% of the mixture is consistent with having occurred during this period. These results show that India experienced a demographic transformation several thousand years ago, from a region in which major population mixture was common to one in which mixture even between closely related groups became rare because of a shift to endogamy."}} Speaking to Fountain Ink, David Reich stated, "Prior to 4,200 years ago, there were unmixed groups in India. Sometime between 1,900 to 4,200 years ago, profound, pervasive convulsive mixture occurred, affecting every Indo-European and Dravidian group in India without exception." Reich pointed out that their work does not show that a substantial migration occurred during this time.&lt;ref group=web name=Perur/&gt;

{{harvtxt|Metspalu et al.|2011}}, representing a collaboration between the Estonian Biocenter and CCMB, confirmed that the Indian populations are characterized by two major ancestry components. One of them is spread at comparable frequency and haplotype diversity in populations of South and West Asia and the Caucasus. The second component is more restricted to South Asia and accounts for more than 50% of the ancestry in Indian populations. Haplotype diversity associated with these South Asian ancestry components is significantly higher than that of the components dominating the West Eurasian ancestry palette.{{sfn|Metspalu et al.|2011}}

====Additional components====
{{harvtxt|ArunKumar et al.|2015}} discern three major ancestry components, which they call "Southwest Asian", "Southeast Asian" and "Northeast Asian". The Southwest Asian component seems to be a native Indian component, while the Southeast Asian component is related to East Asian populations.{{sfn|ArunKumar et al.|2015|p=496}} Brahmin populations "contained 11.4 and 10.6% of Northern Eurasian and Mediterranean components, thereby suggesting a shared ancestry with the Europeans". They note that this fits with earlier studies which "suggested similar shared ancestries with Europeans and Mediterraneans".{{sfn|ArunKumar et al.|2015|p=496}} They further note that
{{quote|Studies based on uni-parental marker have shown diverse Y-chromosomal haplogroups making up the Indian gene pool. Many of these Y-chromosomal markers show a strong correlation to the linguistic affiliation of the population. The genome-wide variation of the Indian samples in the present study correlated with the linguistic affiliation of the sample.{{sfn|ArunKumar et al.|2015|p=497}}}}

They conclude that, while there may have been an ancient settlement in the subcontinent, "male-dominated genetic elements shap[ed] the Indian gene pool", and that these elements "have earlier been correlated to various languages", and further note "the fluidity of female gene pools when in a patriarchal and patrilocal society, such as that of India".{{sfn|ArunKumar et al.|2015|pp=497–498}}

{{harvtxt|Basu et al.|2016}} extend the study of {{harvtxt|Reich et al.|2009}} by postulating two other populations in addition to the ANI and ASI: "Ancestral Austro-Asiatic" (AAA) and "Ancestral Tibeto-Burman" (ATB), corresponding to the [[Austroasiatic languages|Austroasiatic]] and [[Tibeto-Burman languages|Tibeto-Burman]] language speakers.{{sfn|Basu et al.|2016|p=1594}} According to them, ancestral populations seem to have occupied geographically separated habitats.{{sfn|Basu et al.|2016|p=1598}} The ASI and the AAA were early settlers, who possibly arrived via the southern wave out of Africa.{{sfn|Basu et al.|2016|p=1598}} The ANI are related to Central South Asians and entered India through the northwest, while the ATB are related to East Asians and entered India through northeast corridors.{{sfn|Basu et al.|2016|p=1598}} They further note that
{{quote|The asymmetry of admixture, with ANI populations providing genomic inputs to tribal populations (AA, Dravidian tribe, and TB) but not vice versa, is consistent with elite dominance and patriarchy. Males from dominant populations, possibly upper castes, with high ANI component, mated outside of their caste, but their offspring were not allowed to be inducted into the caste. This phenomenon has been previously observed as asymmetry in homogeneity of mtDNA and heterogeneity of Y-chromosomal haplotypes in tribal populations of India as well as the African Americans in United States.{{sfn|Basu et al.|2016|p=1598}}}}

====Male-mediated migration====
Reich et al. (2009), citing {{harvtxt|Kivisild et al.|1999}}, indicate that there has been a low influx of female genetic material since 50,000 years ago, but a "male gene flow from groups with more ANI relatedness into ones with less".{{sfn|Reich et al.|2009}}{{refn|group=note|Reich et al.: "The stronger gradient in males, replicating previous reports, could reflect either male gene flow from groups with more ANI relatedness into ones with less, or female gene flow in the reverse direction. However, extensive female gene flow in India would be expected to homogenize ANI ancestry on the autosomes just as in mtDNA, which we do not observe. Supporting the view of little female ANI ancestry in India, Kivisild et al. reported that mtDNA 'haplogroup U' splits into two deep clades. 'U2i' accounts for 77% of copies in India but ~0% in Europe, and 'U2e' accounts for 0% of all copies in India but ~10% in Europe. The split is ~50,000 years old, indicating low female gene flow between Europe and India since that time."{{sfn|Reich et al.|2009}}}}

===North-south cline===
According to {{harvtxt|Metspalu et al.|2011}} there is "a general principal component cline stretching from Europe to south India". This northwest component is shared with populations from the Middle East, Europe and Central Asia, and is thought to represent at least one ancient influx of people from the northwest.{{sfn|Basu et al.|2003}}{{clarify|reason=Why is a 2003 paper commenting on a 2011 paper?|date=March 2016}} According to Saraswathy et al.

# "migrations that occurred prior to the development of agriculture [8,000–9,000 years before present (BP)]. Evidence for this comes from mitochondrial DNA studies, which have shown that the mitochondrial haplogroups (hg U2, U7, and W) that are most closely shared between Indians and West Eurasians diverged about 30,000–40,000 years BP." 
# "Western Asian peoples migrated to India along with the spread of agriculture [...] Any such agriculture related migrations would probably have begun at least 8,000–9,000 years BP (based on the dates for Mehrgarh) and may have continued into the period of the Indus civilization that began around 4,600 years BP and depended upon West Asian crops." 
# "migrations from Western or Central Asia from 3,000 to 4,000 years BP, a time during which it is likely that Indo-European languages began to be spoken in the subcontinent. A difficulty with this theory, however, is that by this time India was a densely populated region with widespread agriculture, so the number of migrants of West Eurasian ancestry must have been extraordinarily large to explain the fact that today about half the ancestry in India derives from the ANI."

Metspalu et al.

(2011), k5 "might represent the genetic vestige of the ANI", though they also note that the geographic cline of this component within India "is very weak, which is unexpected under the ASI-ANI model", explaining that the ASI-ANI model implies an ANI contribution which decreases toward southern India.{{sfn|Metspalu et al.|2011|p=739}} According to Metspalu et al.

{{Main|Haplogroup R1a}}

The distribution and proposed origin of haplogroup R1a, more specifically R1a1a1b, is often being used as an argument pro or contra the Indo-Aryan migrations. It is found in high frequencies in Eastern Europe (Z282) and south Asia (Z93), the areas of the Indo-European migrations. The place of origin of this haplogroup may give an indication of the "homeland" of the Indo-Europeans, and the direction of the first migrations.{{sfn|Underhill|2015}}

{{harvtxt|Cordeaux et al.|2004}}, based on the spread of a cluster of haplogroups (J2, R1a, R2, and L) in India, with higher rates in northern India,{{sfn|Sahoo et al.|2006|p=843}} argue that agriculture in south India spread with migrating agriculturalists, which also influenced the genepool in south India.{{sfn|Cordeaux et al.|2004|p=1125}}{{sfn|Sahoo et al.|2006|p=843}}

{{harvtxt|Sahoo et al.|2006}}, in response to Cordeaux et al. (2004), suggest that those haplogroups originated in India, based on the spread of these various haplogroups in India. According to Sahoo et al. (2006), this spread "argue[s] against any major influx, from regions north and west of India, of people associated either with the development of agriculture or the spread of the Indo-Aryan language family".{{sfn|Sahoo et al.|2006|p=843}} They further propose that "the high incidence of R1* and R1a throughout Central Asian and East European populations (without R2 and R* in most cases) is more parsimoniously explained by gene flow in the opposite direction",{{sfn|Sahoo et al.|2006|pp=845–846}} which according to Sahoo et al. (2006) explains the "sharing of some Y-chromosomal haplogroups between Indian and Central Asian populations".{{sfn|Sahoo et al.|2006|p=843}}

Sengupta et al. (2006) also comment on Cordeaux et al. (2004), stating that "the influence of Central Asia on the pre-existing gene pool was minor", and arguing for "a peninsular origin of Dravidian speakers than a source with proximity to the Indus and with significant genetic input resulting from demic diffusion associated with agriculture".{{sfn|Sengupta|2006}}

Sharma et al. (2009) found a high frequency of R1a1 in India. They therefore argue for an Indian origin of R1a1, and dispute "the origin of Indian higher most castes from Central Asian and Eurasian regions, supporting their origin within the Indian subcontinent".{{sfn|Sharma et al.|2009}}

Underhill et al. (2014/2015) conclude that R1a1a1, the most frequent subclade of R1a, split into Z282 (Europe) and Z93 (Asia) at circe 5,800 before present.{{sfn|Underhill|2015|p=124}} According to Underhill et al. (2014/2015), "[t]his suggests the possibility that R1a lineages accompanied [[Demic diffusion|demic expansions]] initiated during the Copper, Bronze, and Iron ages."{{sfn|Underhill|2014}} They further note that the diversification of Z93 and the "early urbanization within the Indus Valley also occurred at this time and the geographic distribution of R1a-M780 (Figure 3d) may reflect this".{{sfn|Underhill|2014}}

Palanichamy et al. (2015), while responding to Cordeaux et al. (2004), Sahoo et al. (2006) and Sengupta et al. (2006), elaborated on Kivisild et al.'s (1999) suggestion that West Eurasian haplogroups "may have been spread by the early Neolithic migrations of proto-Dravidian farmers spreading from the eastern horn of the Fertile Crescent into India".{{sfn|Palanichamy|2015|p=638}} They conclude that "the L1a lineage arrived from western Asia during the Neolithic period and perhaps was associated with the spread of the Dravidian language to India", indicating that "the Dravidian language originated outside India and may have been introduced by pastoralists coming from western Asia (Iran)."{{sfn|Palanichamy|2015|p=645}} They further conclude that two subhalogroups originated with the Dravidian speaking peoples, and may have come to South India when the Dravidian language spread.{{sfn|Palanichamy|2015}}

Poznik et al. (2016) note that "striking expansions" occurred within R1a-Z93 at ~4,500–4,000 years ago, which "predates by a few centuries the collapse of the Indus Valley Civilisation".{{sfn|Pozink|2016|p=5}} Mascarenhas et al. (2015) note that the expansion of Z93 from [[Transcaucasia]] into South Asia is compatible with "the archeological records of eastward expansion of West Asian populations in the 4th millennium BCE culminating in the socalled [[Kura–Araxes culture|Kura-Araxes]] migrations in the post-[[Uruk period|Uruk IV period]]".{{sfn|Mascarenhas|2015|p=9}}

The impact, or absence of such an impact, of the Indo-Aryan migrations on the Indian genepool is a matter of ongoing debate.

{{harvtxt|Bamshad et al.|2001}}, Wells et al.

Metspalu et al. (2011) note that "any nonmarginal migration from Central Asia to South Asia should have also introduced readily apparent signals of East Asian ancestry into India" (although this presupposes the unproven assumption that East Asian ancestry was present – to a significant extent – in prehistorical Central Asia), which is not the case, and conclude that if there was a major migration of Eurasians into India, this happened before the rise of the Yamna culture.{{sfn|Metspalu et al.|2011|p=739}} Based on Metspalu (2011), Lalji Singh, a co-author of Metspalu, concludes that "[t]here is no genetic evidence that Indo-Aryans invaded or migrated to India".&lt;ref group=web name="IT"&gt;[http://indiatoday.intoday.in/story/indians-are-not-descendants-of-aryans-study/1/163645.html India Today, ''Indians are not descendants of Aryans, says new study'']&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref group=web&gt;[http://www.dnaindia.com/india/report-new-research-debunks-aryan-invasion-theory-1623744 dnaindia.com, ''New research debunks Aryan invasion theory'']&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref group=web&gt;[http://www.ibtl.in/news/exclusive/1625/aryan-invasion-theory-used-for-divide-and-convert-:-exposed-by-fresh-genetic-research/ ITBL, ''Aryan Invasion Theory used for Divide and Convert: Exposed by fresh Genetic research'']&lt;/ref&gt;{{refn|group=note|Metspalu et al (2011): "However, any nonmarginal migration from Central Asia to the [[Indian subcontinent]] should have also introduced readily apparent signals of East Asian ancestry into India (see Figure 2B).

The demographic history of Central Asia is, however, complex, and although it has been shown that demic diffusion coupled with influx of Turkic speakers during historical times has shaped the genetic makeup of Uzbeks75 [...] it is not clear what was the extent of East Asian ancestry in Central Asian populations prior to these events.{{sfn|Metspalu et al.|2011|p=739}} See also Dinesh C.

===Similarities===

====Mitanni====
{{See also|Mitanni-Aryan}}

The oldest inscriptions in Old Indic, the language of the Rig Veda, is found not in India, but in northern Syria in [[Hittites|Hittite]] records regarding one of their neighbors, the [[Hurrians|Hurrian]]-speaking Mitanni. In a treaty with the Hittites, the king of Mitanni, after swearing by a series of Hurrian gods, swears by the gods Mitrašil, Uruvanaššil, Indara, and Našatianna, who correspond to the Vedic gods [[Mitra]], [[Varuna]], [[Indra]], and Nāsatya (Aśvin). Contemporary equestrian terminology, as recorded in a horse-training manual whose author is identified as "[[Kikkuli]]", contains Indo-Aryan loanwords. The personal names and gods of the Mitanni aristocracy also bear significant traces of Indo-Aryan. Because of the association of Indo-Aryan with horsemanship and the [[Mitanni]] aristocracy, it is presumed that, after superimposing themselves as rulers on a native [[Hurrian language|Hurrian]]-speaking population about the 15th–16th centuries BCE, Indo-Aryan charioteers were absorbed into the local population and adopted the [[Hurrian language]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Mallory|Mair|2000}}{{Page needed|date=September 2010}}&lt;br /&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Mallory|1989}}{{Page needed|date=September 2010}}&lt;br /&gt;[[Studien zu den Bogazkoy-Texten]] '''41''' (1995)&lt;br /&gt;Thieme, as cited in {{Harvcoltxt|Bryant|2001|p=136}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Brentjes argues that there is not a single cultural element of central Asian, Eastern European, or Caucasian origin in the Mitannian area; he also associates with an Indo-Aryan presence the peacock motif found in the Middle East from before 1600 BCE and quite likely from before 2100 BCE.{{sfn|Bryant|2001|p=137}}

Most scholars reject the possibility that the Indo-Aryans of Mitanni came from the Indian subcontinent as well as the possibility that the Indo-Aryans of the Indian subcontinent came from the territory of Mitanni, leaving migration from the north the only likely scenario.{{refn|group=note|Mallory: "It is highly probable that the Indo-Aryans of Western Asia migrated eastwards, for example with the collapse of the Mitanni, and wandered into India, since there is not a shred of evidence — for example, names of non-Indic deities, personal names, loan words — that the Indo-Aryans of India ever had any contacts with their west Asian neighbours. The reverse possibility, that a small group broke off and wandered from India into Western Asia is readily dismissed as an improbably long migration, again without the least bit of evidence."{{sfn|Mallory|1989}}{{Page needed|date=September 2010}}}} The presence of some [[Bactria–Margiana Archaeological Complex|Bactria-Margiana]] loan words in Mitanni, Old Iranian and Vedic further strengthens this scenario.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Witzel|2003}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Iranian Avesta====
The religious practices depicted in the ''Rigveda'' and those depicted in the ''[[Avesta]]'', the central religious text of [[Zoroastrianism]]—the ancient Iranian faith founded by the prophet [[Zoroaster]]—have in common the deity [[Mitra]], priests called ''hotṛ'' in the ''Rigveda'' and ''zaotar'' in the ''Avesta'', and the use of a ritual substance that the ''Rigveda'' calls ''[[soma (drink)|soma]]'' and the ''Avesta'' ''[[haoma]]''. However, the Indo-Aryan ''[[Deva (Hinduism)|deva]]'' 'god' is cognate with the Iranian ''[[daeva|daēva]]'' 'demon'. Similarly, the Indo-Aryan ''[[asura]]'' 'name of a particular group of gods' (later on, 'demon') is cognate with the Iranian ''[[ahura]]'' 'lord, god,' which 19th and early 20th century authors such as Burrow explained as a reflection of religious rivalry between Indo-Aryans and Iranians.&lt;ref&gt;[[Thomas Burrow|Burrow]] as cited in {{Harvcoltxt|Mallory|1989}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Most linguists such as Burrow argue that the strong similarity between the [[Avestan]] of the ''Gāthās''—the oldest part of the ''Avesta''—and the [[Vedic Sanskrit]] of the ''Rigveda'' pushes the dating of Zarathustra or at least the ''Gathas'' closer to the conventional ''Rigveda'' dating of 1500–1200 BCE, i.e. 1100 BCE, possibly earlier. Boyce concurs with a lower date of 1100 BCE and tentatively proposes an upper date of 1500 BCE. Gnoli dates the ''Gathas'' to around 1000 BCE, as does {{Harvtxt|Mallory|1989}}, with the caveat of a 400-year leeway on either side, i.e. between 1400 and 600 BCE. Therefore, the date of the Avesta could also indicate the date of the Rigveda.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Bryant|2001|p=131}}&lt;br /&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Mallory|1989}}&lt;br /&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Mallory|Mair|2000}}&lt;br /&gt;[[Thomas Burrow|Burrow]], as cited in {{Harvcoltxt|Mallory|1989}}&lt;br /&gt;Boyce and Gnoli, as cited in {{Harvcoltxt|Bryant|2001|p=132}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There is mention in the ''Avesta'' of ''Airyan Vaejah'', one of the '16 the lands of the Aryans'.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=Iran Facing Others: Identity Boundaries in a Historical Perspective|page=189|author1=Abbas Amanat |author2=Farzin Vejdani |url=https://books.google.com/?id=IRzIAAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA189&amp;dq=16+nation+of+aryans+avesta#v=onepage&amp;q=16%20nation%20of%20aryans%20avesta&amp;f=false|isbn=9781137013408|date=13 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Gnoli's interpretation of geographic references in the ''Avesta'' situates the ''Airyanem Vaejah'' in the [[Hindu Kush]]. For similar reasons, Boyce excludes places north of the [[Syr Darya]] and western Iranian places. With some reservations, Skjaervo concurs that the evidence of the Avestan texts makes it impossible to avoid the conclusion that they were composed somewhere in northeastern Iran. Witzel points to the central Afghan highlands. Humbach derives Vaējah from [[cognate]]s of the Vedic root "vij", suggesting the region of fast-flowing rivers. Gnoli considers Choresmia (Xvairizem), the lower Oxus region, south of the [[Aral Sea]] to be an outlying area in the Avestan world. However, according to {{Harvtxt|Mallory|Mair|2000}}, the probable homeland of Avestan is, in fact, the area south of the Aral Sea.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Bryant|2001|p=133}}&lt;br /&gt;Gnoli, Boyce, Skjaervo, and Witzel, as cited in {{Harvcoltxt|Bryant|2001|p=133}}&lt;br /&gt;Humbach and Gnoli, as cited in {{Harvcoltxt|Bryant|2001|p=327}}&lt;br /&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Mallory|Mair|2000}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Geographical location of Rigvedic rivers===

{{Main|Sarasvati River|Samudra}}

The geography of the Rigveda seems to be centered on the land of the [[Rigvedic rivers|seven rivers]]. While the geography of the [[Rigvedic rivers]] is unclear in some of the early books of the Rigveda, the [[Nadistuti sukta]] is an important source for the geography of late Rigvedic society.

The Sarasvati River is one of the chief [[Rigvedic rivers]]. The [[Nadistuti sukta]] in the [[Rigveda]] mentions the Sarasvati between the [[Yamuna]] in the east and the [[Sutlej]] in the west, and later texts like the [[Brahmana]]s and [[Mahabharata]] mention that the Sarasvati dried up in a desert.&lt;ref&gt;e.g. [[Mandala 2|RV 2]].12; [[Mandala 4|RV 4]].28; [[Mandala 8|RV 8]].24&lt;/ref&gt;

Most scholars agree that at least some of the references to the Sarasvati in the Rigveda refer to the [[Ghaggar-Hakra River]],&lt;ref name="Ancient Indian Geography p.590"/&gt; while the Afghan river Haraxvaiti/Harauvati [[Helmand River|Helmand]] is sometimes quoted as the locus of the early Rigvedic river.&lt;ref name="Vedas p. 7"/&gt; Whether such a transfer of the name has taken place from the Helmand to the Ghaggar-Hakra is a matter of dispute. Identification of the early Rigvedic Sarasvati with the Ghaggar-Hakra before its assumed drying up early in the second millennium would place the Rigveda BCE,&lt;ref group=web&gt;[http://www.gisdevelopment.net/application/archaeology/site/archs0001pf.htm The Saraswati:- Where lies the mystery&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; well outside the range commonly assumed by Indo-Aryan migration theory.

A non-Indo-Aryan [[Stratum (linguistics)#Substratum|substratum]] in the river-names and place-names of the Rigvedic homeland would support an external origin of the Indo-Aryans.{{Citation needed|date=July 2012}} However, most place-names in the Rigveda and the vast majority of the river-names in the north-west of the [[Indian subcontinent]] are Indo-Aryan.&lt;ref name=B2001&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Bryant|2001}}&lt;/ref&gt; Non-Indo-Aryan names are, however, frequent in the Ghaggar and Kabul River areas,&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Witzel|1999}}{{Page needed|date=September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; the first being a post-Harappan stronghold of Indus populations.{{Citation needed|date=July 2012}}

===Textual references to migrations===

====Rigveda====
[[File:Late Vedic Culture (1100-500 BCE).png|thumb|320px|Probable geographic expansion of late Vedic culture.]]

Just as the Avesta does not mention an external homeland of the Zoroastrians, the Rigveda does not explicitly refer to an external homeland{{sfn|Majumdar|Pusalker|1951|p=220}} or to a migration.{{sfn|Cardona|2002|pp=33–35}}{{refn|group=note|According to Cardona, "there is no textual evidence in the early literary traditions unambiguously showing a trace" of an Indo-Aryan migration.{{sfn|Cardona|2002|pp=33–35}}}} Later Hindu texts, such as the [[Brahmana]]s, [[Mahabharata]], [[Ramayana]], and [[Puranas]], are centered in the [[Ganges]] region (rather than Haryana and Punjab) and mention regions still further to the south and east, suggesting a later movement or expansion of the Vedic religion and culture to the east. There is no clear indication of general movement in either direction in the Rigveda itself; searching for indirect references in the text, or by correlating geographic references with the proposed order of composition of its hymns, has not led to any consensus on the issue.

====Srauta Sutra of Baudhayana====
According to [[Romila Thapar]], the ''[[Baudhayana Shrauta Sutra|Srauta Sutra of Baudhayana]]'' "refers to the Parasus and the arattas who stayed behind and others who moved eastwards to the middle Ganges valley and the places equivalent such as the Kasi, the Videhas and the Kuru Pancalas, and so on. In fact, when one looks for them, there are evidence for migration."&lt;ref group=web name="Agarwal"&gt;[http://www.eshiusa.org/Articles/VedicEvidenceforAMT-Puratattva.pdf Vishal Agarwal (2005), ''On Perceiving Aryan Migrations in Vedic Ritual Texts''.

====Later Vedic and Hindu texts====
Texts like the Puranas and Mahabharata belong to a much later period than the Rigveda, making their evidence less than sufficient to be used for or against the Indo-Aryan migration theory.

Later Vedic texts show a shift{{Citation needed|date=September 2010}} of location from the Punjab to the East. According to the [[Yajurveda]], [[Yajnavalkya]] (a Vedic ritualist and philosopher) lived in the eastern region of [[Mithila (region)|Mithila]].{{sfn|Bryant|2001|p=64}} [[Aitareya Brahmana]] 33.6.1. records that [[Vishvamitra]]'s sons migrated to the north, and in [[Shatapatha Brahmana]] 1:2:4:10 the [[Asura]]s were driven to the north.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Elst|1999}} with reference to L.N. Renou&lt;/ref&gt; In much later texts, [[Manu (Hinduism)|Manu]] was said to be a king from [[South India|Dravida]].&lt;ref&gt;e.g. Bhagavata Purana (VIII.24.13)&lt;/ref&gt; In the legend of the flood he stranded with his ship in Northwestern India or the Himalayas.&lt;ref&gt;e.g. Satapatha Brahmana, Atharva Veda&lt;/ref&gt;
The Vedic lands (e.g. [[Aryavarta]], Brahmavarta) are located in Northern India or at the Sarasvati and [[Drishadvati river]].&lt;ref&gt;e.g. RV 3.23.4., Manu 2.22, etc. Kane, Pandurang Vaman: History of Dharmasastra: (ancient and mediaeval, religious and civil law) — Poona: Bhandarkar Oriental Research Institute, 1962–1975&lt;/ref&gt; However, in a post-Vedic text the [[Mahabharata]] Udyoga Parva (108), the East is described as the homeland of the Vedic culture, where "the divine Creator of the universe first sang the Vedas".&lt;ref&gt;Talageri 1993, The Aryan Invasion Theory, A Reappraisal&lt;/ref&gt; The legends of [[Ikshvaku]], Sumati and other Hindu legends may have their origin in [[Southeast Asia]].&lt;ref&gt;Elst 1999, chapter 5, with reference to Bernard Sergent&lt;/ref&gt;

The Puranas record that [[Yayati]] left [[Allahabad|Prayag]] (confluence of the Ganges &amp; Yamuna) and conquered the region of Sapta Sindhu.&lt;ref&gt;Talageri, ''The Aryan invasion theory: a reappraisal'', 1993&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Update on the Aryan invasion debate'', Elst 1999&lt;/ref&gt; His five sons [[Yadu]], [[Druhyus]], [[Puru (Vedic tribe)|Puru]], [[Anu]] and Turvashu correspond to the main tribes of the Rigveda.

The Puranas also record that the [[Druhyus]] were driven out of the land of the seven rivers by Mandhatr and that their next king Gandhara settled in a north-western region which became known as [[Gandhara]]. The sons of the later Druhyu king [[Prachetas]] are supposed by some to have 'migrated' to the region north of Afghanistan though the Puranic texts only speak of an "adjacent" settlement.&lt;ref&gt;[[Bhagavata Purana]] 9.23.15–16; [[Visnu Purana]] 4.17.5; [[Vayu Purana]] 99.11–12; [[Brahmanda Purana]] 3.74.11–12 and [[Matsya Purana]] 48.9.&lt;/ref&gt;{{refn|see e.g. {{harvnb|Pargiter|1979}}, {{harvnb|Talageri|1993}}, {{harvnb|Talageri|2000}}, {{harvnb|Bryant|2001}}, {{harvnb|Elst|1999}}}}

Climate change and drought may have triggered both the initial dispersal of Indo-European speakers, and the migration of Indo-Europeans from the steppes in south-central Asia and India.

Around 4200–4100 BCE a climate change occurred, manifesting in colder winters in Europe.{{sfn|Anthony|2007|p=227}} Between 4200 and 3900 BCE many tell settlements in the lower Danube Valley were burned and abandoned,{{sfn|Anthony|2007|p=227}} while the Cucuteni-Tripolye culture showed an increase in fortifications,{{sfn|Anthony|2007|p=230}} meanwhile moving eastwards towards the Dniepr.{{sfn|Anthony|2007|p=232}} Steppe herders, archaic Proto-Indo-European speakers, spread into the lower Danube valley about 4200–4000 BCE, either causing or taking advantage of the collapse of [[Old Europe (archaeology)|Old Europe]].{{sfn|Anthony|2007|p=133}}

The Yamna horizon was an adaptation to a climate change which occurred between 3500 and 3000 BCE, in which the steppes became drier and cooler. Herds needed to be moved frquently to feed them sufficiently, and the use of wagons and horse-back riding made this possible, leading to "a new, more mobile form of pastoralism".{{sfn|Anthony|2007|p=300, 336}} It was accompanied by new social rules and institutions, to regulate the local migrations in the steppes, creating a new social awareness of a distinct culture, and of "cultural Others" who did not participate in these new institutions.{{sfn|Anthony|2007|p=300}}

==Controversy==
The debate about the origin of Indo-Aryan peoples is controversial in the Indian subcontinent. It is seen as an oppressive colonial construct, which undermines Indian narratives of the ancientness and indigenous origins of Indian people, language, culture and religion. The theory has been increasingly criticised in India with the growing popularity of Hindutva-politics in the 1990s.

==="Indigenous Aryans"===
{{Main|Indigenous Aryans}}

Opponents of the Indo-Aryan migration theory question it and instead promote the notion of ''Indigenous Aryans'', which claims that speakers of [[Indo-Iranian languages]] (sometimes called ''Aryan languages'') are "indigenous" to the Indian subcontinent.{{sfn|Fosse|2005}} Within India, several such alternative ideas of the origins of the Indo-Iranian languages and cultures have been developed that purport to show indigenous origins.{{sfn|Bryant|2001}} They are rejected by mainstream scholars, who point out that they neglect linguistic research,{{sfn|Bryant|2001}} and are contradicted by a broad range of research on [[Indo-European migrations]].{{sfn|Anthony|2007}}

The proposed "Indigenous Aryans" scenario is based on specific interpretations of archaeological, genetic, and linguistic data and on literary interpretations of the [[Rigveda]].&lt;ref name="Kazanas - The Collapse of the AIT and the prevalence of Indigenism"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Kazanas|first1=Nicholas|authorlink1=Nicholas Kazanas|title=The Collapse of the AIT and the prevalence of Indigenism: archaeological, genetic, linguistic and literary evidences.|url=http://www.omilosmeleton.gr/pdf/en/indology/The_Collapse_of_the_AIT_13_2_2013.pdf|website=www.omilosmeleton.gr|accessdate=23 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Standard arguments supporting the "Indigenous Aryans" theory or opposing the mainstream Indo-Aryan migration theory include the following:
* Questioning the Indo-Aryan migration theory:
:* Presenting the Indo-Aryan migration theory as an "Indo-Aryan invasion theory";{{sfn|Witzel|2005|p=348}}{{refn|group=note|name="invasion"|The term "invasion" is only used nowadays by opponents of the Indo-Aryan migration theory.{{sfn|Witzel|2005|p=348}} The term "invasion" does not reflect the contemporary scholarly understanding of the Indo-Aryan migrations;{{sfn|Witzel|2005|p=348}} and is merely used in a polemical and distractive way.}}
:* Questioning the methodology of linguistics;{{sfn|Elst|2005}}&lt;ref name="Kak-The Wishing Tree"&gt;{{citation|last1=Kak|first1=Subhash|title=The Wishing Tree: Presence and Promise of India|date=2001|publisher=Munshiram Manoharlal Publishers|isbn=978-0595490943|pages=10–16|url=https://books.google.com/?id=_k9uAAAAMAAJ&amp;q=The+Wishing+Tree%3A+The+Presence+and+Promise+of+India|accessdate=29 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;
:* Reinterpretation of the linguistic data, arguing for the ancient, indigenous origins of Sanskrit;{{sfn|Elst|1999}}{{sfn|Elst|2005}}

* Scholars like [[Jim G. Shaffer]] and B.B. Lal note the absence of archaeological remains of an Aryan "conquest" and note the high degree of physical continuity between Harappan and Post-Harappan society.&lt;ref group=web name="EB-IAS" /&gt; They support the controversial&lt;ref group=web name="EB-IAS"&gt;[http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/285248/India/46837/The-appearance-of-Indo-Aryan-speakers Stanley A. Wolpert, ''The appearance of Indo-Aryan speakers'', Encyclopædia Britannica]&lt;/ref&gt; theory that the Aryan civilization was not introduced by Aryan migrations, but originated in pre-Vedic India.&lt;ref group=web name="EB-IAS" /&gt;
* [[Jim G. Shaffer|Jim Shaffer]] has noted several problems with the arguments that the ancient Harappans were Aryans.{{sfn|Kennedy|2000|p=371}} According to Shaffer, archaeological evidence consistent with a mass population movement, or an invasion of the [[Indian subcontinent]] in the pre- or proto- historic periods, has not been found. Instead, Shaffer proposes a series of cultural changes reflecting indigenous cultural developments from prehistoric to historic periods.{{sfn|Shaffer|1984}}{{refn|group=subnote|Shaffer: "Current archaeological data do not support the existence of an Indo-Aryan or European invasion into South Asia any time in the pre- or protohistoric periods. Instead, it is possible to document archaeologically a series of cultural changes reflecting indigenous cultural developments from prehistoric to historic periods". Shaffer{{sfn|Shaffer|1984}} as cited in {{harvnb|Bryant|2001|p=232}}}} Shaffer contends:
{{quote|There were no invasions from central or western South Asia. Rather there were several internal cultural adjustments reflecting altered ecological, social and economic conditions affecting northwestern and north-central South Asia.{{sfn|Bryant|2001|p=192}}}}
* Lal notes that at [[Kalibangan]] (at the [[Ghaggar]] river) the remains of what some writers claim to be [[fire]] [[altar]]s have been unearthed that are claimed to have been used for [[Vedic sacrifice]]s, although the presence of animal bones does not seem consistent with Vedic rites. In addition, the remains of a bathing place (suggestive of ceremonial bathing) have been found near the altars in Kalibangan.{{sfn|Lal|1984|pp=57–58}} S.R. Rao found similar "fire altars" in [[Lothal]] which he thinks could have served no other purpose than [[Vedic ritual]].{{sfn|Rao|1993|p=175}} The sites in Kalibangan are dated back to pre-Harappan times i.e. 3500 BC, well before any likely date for the Indo-Aryan migrations, so this may suggest that Vedic rites are indigenous to India and not brought in from outside.&lt;ref&gt;Ram Sharan Sharma (1999).

A similar case has been Central Europe, where the archaeological evidence shows continuous linear development, with no marked external influences.{{refn|group=subnote|Häusler, as cited in {{harvnb|Bryant|2001|p=141}}}} Archaeological continuity can be supported for every Indo-European-speaking region of [[Eurasia]], not just India.{{refn|group=subnote|Mallory, in {{harvnb|Blench|Spriggs|1997}}}}{{refn|group=subnote|Bryant: "India is not the only Indo-European-speaking area that has not revealed any archaeological traces of immigration." As {{harvnb|Bryant|2001|p=235}}}} Several historically documented migrations, such as those of the [[Helvetii]] to [[Switzerland]], the [[Huns]] into [[Europe]], or [[Irish language|Gaelic]]-speakers into [[Scotland]] are not attested in the archaeological record.{{refn|group=subnote|{{harvnb|Anthony|1986}}, {{harvnb|Sinor|1990|p=203}}, {{harvnb|Mallory|1989|p=166}} as cited in {{harvnb|Bryant|2001|p=235}}}} As {{harvnb|Cavalli-Sforza|2000}} sums up, "archaeology can verify the occurrence of migration only in exceptional cases".}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="32405">Like many wars, much of the [[American Revolutionary War]] was fought by means other than combat. Politics and espionage played their roles.  For American operations see  [[Intelligence in the American Revolutionary War]].

== Political action ==
=== France ===
While intelligence committees of the [[Continental Congress]] were meeting in Philadelphia, [[Arthur Lee (diplomat)|Arthur Lee]] was meeting in London with [[Pierre-Augustin Caron de Beaumarchais]], the successful author of [[Le Barbier de Séville]] who was a French agent.&lt;ref&gt;Harlow Giles Unger, ''Improbable Patriot: The Secret History of Monsieur de Beaumarchais, the French Playwright Who Saved the American Revolution'' (2011).&lt;/ref&gt;  Lee's inflated reports of patriot strength, which either he fabricated for Beaumarchais' benefit or were provided by Lee's regular correspondent, [[Samuel Adams]], won the Frenchman to the American cause. Beaumarchais repeatedly urged the French Court to give immediate assistance to the Americans, and on February 29, 1776 addressed a memorial to [[Louis XVI of France|Louis XVI]] quoting Lee's offer of a secret long-term treaty of commerce in exchange for secret aid to the war of independence. Beaumarchais explained that France could grant such aid without compromising itself, but urged that "success of the plan depends wholly upon rapidity as well as secrecy: Your Majesty knows better than any one that secrecy is the soul of business, and that in politics a project once disclosed is a project doomed to failure."

With the memorial, Beaumarchais submitted a plan proposing that he set up a commercial trading firm as a [[Cover (intelligence)|cover]] for the secret aid; he requested and was granted one million [[French livre|livres]] to establish a firm called [[Roderigue Hortalez and Company|Roderigue Hortalez et Cie]] for that purpose. Beaumarchais' memorial was followed by one of March 12, 1776, by the [[French minister of foreign affairs|French Minister of Foreign Affairs]], the [[Charles Gravier, comte de Vergennes|Comte de Vergennes]]. [[Royal assent]] was granted, and by the time [[Silas Deane]] arrived in Paris, French arms and other aid was on its way to the revolutionaries. Deane expanded the relationship, working with Beaumarchais and other French merchants to procure ships, commission privateers, recruit French officers, and purchase French military supplies declared "surplus" for that purpose.

On September 26, 1776, the Congress elected three commissioners to the Court of France—[[Benjamin Franklin]], [[Thomas Jefferson]] and [[Silas Deane]]—resolving that "secrecy shall be observed until further Order of Congress; and that until permission be obtained from Congress to disclose the particulars of this business, no member be permitted to say anything more upon this subject, than that Congress have taken such steps as they judged necessary for the purpose of obtaining foreign alliance." Because of his wife's illness, Jefferson could not serve, and Arthur Lee was appointed in his stead.

With Franklin's arrival in France on November 29, 1776—the first anniversary of the founding of the [[Committee of Secret Correspondence]]—the French mission became an intelligence and propaganda center for Europe, an unofficial diplomatic representation, a coordinating facility for aid from America's secret allies, and a recruiting station for such French officers as [[Gilbert du Motier, marquis de Lafayette|Lafayette]] and [[Johann de Kalb]]. In October 1777 the [[Continental Army]] won a crucial victory over the British at [[Battle of Saratoga|Saratoga]], and on February 6, 1778, the French-American treaty of alliance was signed. On March 30, 1778, Franklin, Lee, and Deane were received at the French Court as representatives of the United States of America, and on July 7 [[Jean Baptiste Charles Henri Hector d'Estaing|Comte d'Estaing]]'s fleet cast anchor in the [[Delaware River]]. France was now in the war; the mission to Paris had succeeded.&lt;ref&gt;Stacy Schiff, ''A Great Improvisation: Franklin, France, and the Birth of America''  (2005)&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Spain and its colonies ===
Spain, at the urging of Vergennes, matched France's one million livres for the operation of Hortalez et Cie. But that was not the beginning of secret Spanish aid. During the summer of 1776 [[Luis de Unzaga y Amezaga]], the governor of [[New Spain]] at [[New Orleans]], had privately delivered five [[ton]]s of gunpowder, out of the King's stores, to Captain George Gibson and [[Lieutenant]] Linn of the [[Virginia]] [[Council of Defense]]. The gunpowder moved up the Mississippi River  under the protection of the [[flag of Spain]] and was used to thwart British plans to capture [[Fort Pitt (Pennsylvania)|Fort Pitt]].

[[Oliver Pollock]], a New Orleans businessman, had interceded on behalf of the Virginians. When [[Bernardo de Galvez]] became governor of [[New Orleans]], Pollock—who was soon appointed an agent of the Secret Committee there—worked closely with the young officer to provide additional supplies to the Americans. Galvez also agreed to grant protection to American ships while seizing British ships as smugglers, and to allow American privateers to sell their seized wares at New Orleans. [[Havana]], too, became a focal point for dispensing secret Spanish aid to the Americans. From Galvez the revolutionaries received gunpowder and supplies for the [[George Rogers Clark]] expedition, and from Galvez' secret service fund came the funds used by Colonel Clark for the capture of [[Kaskaskia]] and [[Vincennes, Indiana|Vincennes]]. When Spain formally entered the war on the American side on June 21, 1779, Oliver Pollock—who suffered bankruptcy in funding the purchase of supplies for the cause of independence—rode as [[aide-de-camp]] to Galvez in the capture of [[Baton Rouge]], [[Natchez, Louisiana|Natchez]], [[Mobile, Alabama|Mobile]], and [[Pensacola, Florida|Pensacola]].&lt;ref&gt;Thomas E. Chávez, ''Spain and the Independence of the United States''  (2002). &lt;/ref&gt;

=== The Caribbean ===
Another center of secret aid was [[St. Eustatia Island]] in the [[West Indies]]. A Dutch free port set in the midst of English, French, Danish and Spanish colonies, St. Eustatia (now [[Sint Eustatius]]) became—in the words of a British intelligence document of the period—"the rendezvous of everything and everybody meant to be clandestinely conveyed to America." It was a major source of gunpowder for the American cause, and perhaps the safest and quickest means of communications between American representatives and agents abroad and with the Congress and others at home.&lt;ref&gt;J. Franklin Jameson,  "St. Eustatius in the American Revolution." ''American Historical Review'' (1903) 8#4: 683-708. [https://www.jstor.org/stable/1834346 online free]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Andrew Jackson O'Shaughnessy, ''An empire divided: the American Revolution and the British Caribbean'' (2000).&lt;/ref&gt;

== Covert action ==

=== Bermuda ===

In July 1775, Benjamin Franklin and Robert Morris worked out a plan in collaboration with Colonel [[Henry Tucker (of The Grove)|Henry Tucker]], the head of a distinguished [[Bermuda]] family, to obtain the store of gunpowder in the [[Royal Naval Dockyard, Bermuda]]. To give Bermuda much-needed food in exchange for the powder, Congress resolved on July 15, 1775 to permit the exchange of food for guns and gunpowder brought by any vessel to an American port. On the night of August 14, 1775, two American ships kept a rendezvous with Colonel Tucker's men off the coast of Bermuda, and sent a raiding party ashore. An American sailor was lowered into the arsenal through an opening in the roof, and opened the doors. The barrels of gunpowder were rolled to waiting Bermudian [[whaleboat]]s and transported to the American ships. Twelve days later half of the powder was delivered to Philadelphia and half to American forces at [[Charleston, South Carolina|Charleston]].  America's second covert action effort ended in failure. General Washington, hearing independently of the Bermuda powder, dispatched ships to purchase or seize it. Lacking a centralized intelligence authority, he was unaware of the previous success; when Washington's ships arrived in Bermuda in October 1775, the gunpowder had been gone for two months and British ships patrolled Bermuda waters.&lt;ref&gt;Wilfred Brenton Kerr, ''Bermuda and the American revolution: 1760-1783'' (1936).&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Canada ===

On the basis of information received by the Secret Correspondence Committee, on February 15, 1776 Congress authorized a covert action plan to urge the Canadians to become a "sister colony" in the struggle against the British. A French printer was dispatched to Canada "to establish a free press... for the frequent publication of such pieces as may be of service to the cause of the United Colonies." Benjamin Franklin, [[Samuel Chase]], and [[Charles Carroll of Carrollton|Charles Carroll]] were appointed from the Congress to undertake the mission, and Father [[John Carroll (priest)|John Carroll]] was invited to join the team to prevail upon the Catholic clergy of Canada. The delegation was given a degree of authority over American expeditionary forces in Canada; it was empowered to raise six [[company (military)|companies]] in Canada, and to offer sanctuary in the thirteen colonies "for all those who have adhered to us." Excesses against the Canadian populace by the American military forces, the hostility of the clergy, and the inability of American commissioners to deliver little more than promises in exchange for Canadian [[defection]], doomed the project. With the arrival of summer, both military and political action in Canada had ended in failure.

== Foreign intelligence ==
The first intelligence agent enlisted by the Secret Correspondence Committee was Arthur Lee, then living in London. On November 30, 1775, the day after its founding, the Committee appointed Dr. Lee as its agent in England and told him that "it is considered of utmost consequence to the cause of liberty that the Committee be kept informed of developments in Europe." Following the first Congressional appropriation for the work of the Committee on December 11, 1775, two hundred [[GBP|pounds]] was forwarded to Lee with the urging that he find out the "disposition of foreign powers towards us, and the admonition that we need not hint that great circumspection and impenetrable security are necessary."

The next agent recruited abroad by the Committee was [[Charles W. F. Dumas]], a Swiss journalist at [[The Hague]]. Dumas was briefed personally by Thomas Story, a [[courier]] of the Committee, and instructed on the use of cover names and letter drops to be used for his reports to the Committee and for communication with Dr. Lee in London. He also planted stories in a [[Netherlands|Dutch]] [[newspaper]], [[Gazette de Leide]], intended to give the United States a favorable rating in Dutch credit markets.

On March 1, 1776, the Committee appointed Silas Deane, a former delegate to Congress and future [[ambassador]] to France, as its agent there. He was instructed to pose as a Bermudian merchant dealing in Indian goods. He was also charged with making secret purchases and with attempting to gain secret assistance from the [[French crown]]. Later, both Deane and Lee would be converted from agents to commissioners to the French Crown, albeit secret ones, until the open and formal alliance of France with the Americans.

Other agents of the Committee included [[William Bingham]], who served first in France and then in [[Martinique]], where he had once been British [[Consul (representative)|Consul]]; Major [[Jonathan Loring Austin]], [[William Carmichael (diplomat)|William Carmichael]], and [[William Hodge]].

== Special operations ==
=== Kidnapping ===
For a review of many episodes see Christian McBurney, ''Abductions in the American Revolution: Attempts to Kidnap George Washington, Benedict Arnold and Other Military and Civilian Leaders'' (2016)
==== Benedict Arnold ====
After [[Benedict Arnold]] defected, several special operations, none successful, were mounted in an effort to capture him. In September 1780, Major [[Light Horse Harry Lee|Henry "Light-Horse Harry" Lee]] presented to Washington a plan to return the defector to American control and execute him. Washington approved the plan, but insisted that Arnold not be killed or injured in carrying it out, even at the risk of allowing him to escape. "Public punishment," said Washington, "is the sole object in view."

Lee's sergeant major, [[John Champe (soldier)|John Champe]] of [[Loudoun County]], Virginia, was assigned to this special mission, and on the evening of October 19, 1780, "deserted" to the British under a hail of gunfire. The official documents he carried and his cooperative attitude during interrogation convinced the British he was a genuine deserter. He was appointed sergeant major of Benedict Arnold's American Legion (No relation to the modern [[American Legion]]), which was composed of rebel deserters and Loyalists. Champe, now wearing a British [[uniform]] and having obtained freedom of movement in British-occupied New York City, made contact with American agents there and laid plans for Arnold's capture. Arnold's legion embarked for Virginia on the night the operation was to take place, and the plan was aborted. Champe accomplished his other mission, namely finding out if other American officers were collaborating with the enemy. He found no evidence that any were.&lt;ref&gt; Christian McBurney, ''Abductions in the American Revolution: Attempts to Kidnap George Washington, Benedict Arnold and Other Military and Civilian Leaders'' (2016) pp 96-103.&lt;/ref&gt;
 

In March 1781, an attempt to capture Arnold during his daily ride to the Virginia shore of the [[Chesapeake Bay]] was foiled by the chance anchoring of some British ships in the area. Yet another plan, devised by Thomas Jefferson, called for General [[Peter Muhlenberg|John Peter Muhlenberg]] to send hand-picked soldiers "to seize and bring off this greatest of traitors" at [[Portsmouth, Virginia]]. Unusual security precautions at the British outpost thwarted the attempt.

==== Hostage taking ====

Recognizing the value of a royal hostage, Washington approved in 1782 a plan to capture the son of [[George III of the United Kingdom|King George III]], [[William IV of the United Kingdom|The Prince William]] (the future king, William IV), during the young naval officer's posting to New York. The operation failed after British intelligence heard about it and the Prince increased security around himself. After William later became monarch, the American ambassador told him of the wartime plan and of Washington's edict that, if the mission were successful, the young Prince should suffer no "insult or indignity." Upon hearing the story, William IV responded: "I am obliged to General Washington for his humanity, but I'm damned glad I did not give him an opportunity of exercising it towards me."&lt;ref&gt; McBurney, ''Abductions in the American Revolution'' (2016) pp 157-66&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Privateering ===

On the [[high seas]], British supply ships and troop ships often fell to American privateers operating under [[letters of marque and reprisal]] from the Continental Congress. Franklin, for example, ran a flotilla of Irish and French privateers from the American mission in Paris. Success in intercepting British vessels was so great that the British accused their captains of taking bribes from the Americans to surrender their ships. One privateer, operating under contract to Silas Deane and a French business associate and utilizing a French ship obtained by Benjamin Franklin, was the ''[[USS Bonhomme Richard (1765)|Bonhomme Richard]]'', commanded by [[John Paul Jones]].

=== Sabotage ===

Only one sabotage mission is known to have been launched in England. Sometime after his arrival in Paris, Silas Deane was visited by a young man named [[John the Painter|James Aitken]], recently returned from America. Aitken produced crudely drawn but accurate plans of the [[Royal Navy Dockyards]] in England and proposed to sabotage them by utilizing a unique [[incendiary device]] of his own design. Deane engaged his services and issued Aitken a passport signed by French Foreign Minister Vergennes with instructions to French officials: "We will and command you very expressly to let pass safely and freely, Mr. James Actzen, going to England, without giving him or suffering him any hindrance; but on the contrary giving every aid and assistance that he shall want or occasion for." In late November 1776, Aitken landed at [[Dover]], and on December 7 he ignited a fire at the [[Portsmouth]] dockyard that burned from late in the afternoon until the following morning, destroying twenty tons of [[hemp]], ten one-hundred-[[fathom]] (183 m) [[Wire rope|cables]], and six tons of ship [[Rope|cordage]]. After failing to penetrate the security at [[Plymouth]], Aitken proceeded to [[Bristol]], where he destroyed two [[warehouse]]s and several [[house]]s. On January 16, 1777, the British cabinet met in emergency session and urged immediate measures to locate the mysterious "John the [[Painting|Painter]]" (Aitken was a house painter). Guards were augmented at all military facilities and arsenals, and a reward was posted. By January 20 the cabinet, again in extraordinary session, discussed suspending [[habeas corpus]] and placing the country under [[martial law]]. Five days later the reward was increased to one thousand pounds, and newspapers reported panic throughout England. Aitken was soon apprehended, with a pistol and [[explosive|inflammables]] in his possession. He would not admit to the sabotage when [[interrogation|interrogated]], but eventually confided in a friendly American visitor who was secretly in the pay of the British. Based on these confidences, personal effects, including the passport from Vergennes, were located. His trial was speedy, and on March 10, 1777, Aitken went to the [[gallows]] at [[Portsmouth Dockyard]], where his exploits had begun.

His actions may have resulted in "[[arson in royal dockyards|arson in the Royal dockyards]] in the time of [[war]]" being added to the list of [[capital crime]]s in England, which was one of the last to be repealed.

== Counterintelligence ==

Probably the first organization under the [[Articles of Confederation]] created for counterintelligence purposes was the [[Committee for Detecting and Defeating Conspiracies]], later the Commission. It was made up of a series of groups established in New York between June 1776 and January 1778 to collect intelligence, apprehend British spies and couriers, and examine suspected British sympathizers. In effect, it was created as a "secret service" which had the power to [[arrest]], to [[convict]], to grant [[bail]] or [[parole]], and to im[[prison]] or to [[deport]]. A company of militia was placed under its command. The Committee heard over 500 cases involving [[disloyalty]] and [[subversion (political)|subversion]]. [[John Jay]] has been called the first chief of American counterintelligence because of his role in the Committee.

[[William Duer (Continental Congressman)|William Duer]],&lt;ref&gt;Duer is sometimes called "Colonel" Duer but he in fact decline a militia commission, apparently because he feared the British would confiscate property held jointly by him and his brother in [[Dominica]]. Jones, Robert Francis. [https://books.google.com/books?id=unTmfLoFhGwC&amp;printsec=frontcover ''"The King of the Alley": William Duer, Politician, Entrepreneur, and Speculator, 1768-1799'']. Philadelphia: American Philosophical Society, 1992. {{ISBN|0-87169-202-3}}. p. 11.&lt;/ref&gt; a New York planter and politician, and [[Nathanial Sackett]], an agent suggested by Duer to George Washington, were particularly successful in ferreting out British agents, but found their greatest success in the missions of one of the dozen or so agents of their own, [[Enoch Crosby]]. Crosby, a veteran of the Continental Army, had been mistaken by a Westchester County Loyalist as being someone who shared his views. He confided to Crosby that a secret enemy military company was being formed and introduced him to the group. Crosby reported the plot to the Committee and was taken with the group. He managed to "escape" and, as directed, infiltrated another secret Tory unit. This unit, including Crosby, was also taken and escaped once more. He repeated the operation at least two more times, before the loyalists started to get wise to his "escaping" and he retired. Crosby was the model for the central character in [[James Fenimore Cooper]]'s book [[The Spy (Cooper novel)|The Spy]] (1821), the first [[Spy fiction|espionage novel]] written in English.

Another successful American agent was Captain [[David Gray (soldier)|David Gray]] of Massachusetts. Posing as a deserter, Gray entered the service of Colonel Beverly Robinson, a Tory intelligence officer, and became Robinson's courier. As a result, the contents of each of Robinson's dispatches were read by the Americans before their delivery. Gray eventually became the courier for Major [[Oliver DeLancey, Jr.]], the head of the British secret service in New York. For two years, Gray, as DeLancey's courier to Canada, successfully penetrated the principal communications link of the British [[secret service]]. Upon completing his assignment, Gray returned to the ranks of the Continental Army and his name was struck from the [[deserter list]], where it had been placed at the beginning of the operation.

Colonel [[Benjamin Tallmadge]], a senior intelligence officer under Washington, played a key role in the capture of Major [[John André]], who preceded DeLancey as chief of the British secret service in New York. Although he declined to discuss the episode in his memoirs, it is said that one of Tallmadge's agents had reported to him that Major André was in contact with a "John Anderson" who was expecting the surrender of a major installation. Learning that a certain John Anderson had been captured by three Militiamen, Tallmadge hurried to the post where André was being held. John Paulding, Isaac Van Wert and David Williams had been on sentry trying to catch loyalist "Cow-Boys" that had been preying on people in Westchester County, New York. André mistakenly assumed that the men were aligned with the British and declared himself to be a British officer. Then upon realizing the mistake tried to use a pass provided by Arnold. They searched André and found papers hidden in his socks. Paulding understood the papers revealed "Anderson" to be a spy, and stated that no amount of money would be enough to let André go.  As Tallmadge arrived to the post, he found that the acting Post Commander had sent André, under guard, back to General Arnold. After extensive and animated lobbying by Tallmadge, the commander, Jamieson, ordered that "Anderson"  be returned for interrogation. "Anderson" admitted to his true identity (that he was André) and was tried, convicted, and executed as a spy. Arnold, learning that André had been taken and that his own treachery was no doubt was exposed, fled West Point before he could be captured, and joined the British forces.

General Washington demanded effective counterintelligence work from his subordinates. On March 24, 1776, for example, he wrote: "There is one evil I dread, and that is, their spies. I could wish, therefore, the most attentive watch be kept... I wish a dozen or more of honest, sensible and diligent men, were employed... in order to question, [[cross examination|cross-question]] etc., all such persons as are unknown, and cannot give an account of themselves in a straight and satisfactory line.... I think it a matter of importance to prevent them from obtaining intelligence of our situation." Washington occasionally had to deal with rogue intelligence officers in his own ranks who used their positions for personal gain or undertook unauthorized or illegal operations that might have compromised parts of his intelligence apparatus. Once Washington discovered that two of his agents who supposedly were collecting intelligence on Long Island actually were "mere plundering parties." He set up a special team to investigate and arrest the renegade operatives.

== Deception operations ==
To offset British superiority in firepower and number of troops, General Washington made frequent use of deception and [[disinformation]]. He allowed fabricated documents to fall into the hands of enemy agents or be discussed in their presence. He allowed couriers carrying bogus information to be "captured" by the British, and inserted forged documents in intercepted British communications that were then permitted to continue on to their destination. He had army procurement officers make false purchases of large quantities of supplies in places picked to convince the British that a sizable rebel force was massing. Washington even had fake military facilities built. In all this he managed to make the British believe that his three-thousand-man army outside Philadelphia was forty thousand strong.

After learning from the Culper Ring that the British planned to attack a French expedition that had just landed in [[Newport, Rhode Island]], Washington planted information with known British agents indicating that he intended to move against New York City. The British commander held back the troops headed for Rhode Island. With elaborate deception, Washington masked his movement toward Chesapeake Bay and Yorktown by convincing the British that he was moving on New York.

At [[Yorktown, Virginia|Yorktown]], [[James Armistead]], a [[slavery in Colonial America|slave]] who had joined Lafayette's service with his master's permission, crossed into Cornwallis' lines in the guise of an escaped slave, and was recruited by Cornwallis to return to American lines as a spy. Lafayette gave him a fabricated order that was destined for a large number of nonexistent replacements. Armistead delivered the bogus order in crumpled, dirty condition to Cornwallis, claiming to have found it along the road during his mission. Cornwallis believed him and did not learn he had been tricked until after his surrender. Armistead was granted his freedom by the [[Virginia General Assembly]] as a result of this and other wartime service.

Another deception operation at Yorktown found [[Charles Morgan (American soldier)|Charles Morgan]] entering Cornwallis' camp as a deserter. When debriefed by the British, he convinced them that Lafayette had sufficient boats to move all his troops against the British in one landing operation. Cornwallis was duped by him and dug in rather than marched out of Yorktown. Morgan, in turn, escaped in a British uniform and returned to the American lines with five British deserters and a prisoner.

== Propaganda ==
Upon receiving accurate intelligence that the British were hiring [[Hessian (soldiers)|Hessian]] [[mercenary|mercenaries]] for service in America, Congress appointed a three-man committee "to devise a plan for encouraging the Hessions and other foreigners... to quit that iniquitous service." The result was a resolution, believed to have been drafted by [[Thomas Jefferson]], offering land grants to [[German people|German]] deserters. It was translated into German and sent among the Hessians.

Benjamin Franklin, who joined the committee to implement the operation, arranged for the leaflets to be disguised as tobacco packets to make sure they would fall into the hands of ordinary Hessian soldiers. [[Christopher Ludwick]] was dispatched by Washington into the enemy camp, posing as a deserter, to contact the Hessians and encourage them to defect. He is credited with the defection of "many hundred soldiers" from the German ranks.

In 1777, after his arrival in France, Benjamin Franklin fabricated a letter purportedly sent by a German prince to the commander of his mercenaries in America. The letter disputed British casualty figures for the German troops, arguing that the actual number was much higher and that he was entitled to a great amount of "[[Blood money (term)|blood money]]", the amount paid to the prince for each of his men killed or wounded. The prince also encouraged the officer to be humane and to allow his wounded to die, rather than try to save men who might only become cripples unfit for service to their prince.

Between 5,000 and 6,000 Hessians deserted from the British side during the war, in part because of American propaganda.

Franklin also produced a newspaper report purporting to describe the transmittal of scalps of soldiers, settlers, women and children to the [[Royal Governor of Canada]] by Britain's [[Native Americans in the United States|Indian]] allies. The Indian transmittal letter indicated that a certain mark on scalps indicated they were those of women who "were knocked dead or had their brains beat out."

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5043">'''Janov Pelorat''' is a character in the [[The Foundation Series|''Foundation'' Series]] of books by [[Isaac Asimov]]. The two books in which he appears are ''[[Foundation's Edge]]'' and ''[[Foundation and Earth]]''.

Pelorat is a professor of ancient history who has spent his entire life on his obsession of finding [[Earth]], the mythical planet of human origin. He has a particular interest in myths and folklore. Janov's interest in Earth began when, at age fifteen during some indisposition, he was given a book of legends about the origin of humanity. On [[Terminus (planet)|Terminus]], Janov has collected a massive amount of data regarding the Origin Question, and is Terminus' foremost expert regarding Earth.

Janov Pelorat first appears in ''Foundation's Edge''. He is described as white-haired, of average height and weight, and moves without haste and speaks with deliberation. He is 52 years of age but appears considerably older. He has been married in the past, and has a housekeeper named Kloda.&lt;ref name="page33"&gt;{{cite book |last=Asimov |first=Isaac |authorlink=Isaac Asimov |title=[[Foundation's Edge]] |edition= |series=[[Foundation Series]] |date= |year=1982 |month= |publisher=Doubleday &amp; Company |location=United States |isbn=0-385-17725-9|chapter=Chapter Three, Historian |quote= |page= 33 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Unusual for a historian of the [[futuristic]] society he belongs to, at the time he is first mentioned, he has never left the planet Terminus. Therefore, in addition to the resources available to him from the [[Terminus University Library]], he makes use of interlibrary loans. Such loans can make use of "hyper-radiational signals", which are not described in the stories but appear to refer to a method of transmitting information over vast distances at speeds faster than light.&lt;ref name="page33"/&gt;

When he is first described, he is beginning his first [[sabbatical]] and hoping to travel off planet for the first time. His goal is the planet [[Trantor]], which was [[Capital (political)|capital]] of the First [[Galactic Empire (Asimov)|Galactic Empire]] and the home of the [[Galactic Library]] (also known as the Library of Trantor, the Imperial Library, and the University of Trantor Library), which during the heights of the First Galactic Empire was the largest repository of reference material in the galaxy. No member of the Foundation has been to Trantor in 120 years.&lt;ref name="page3335"&gt;{{cite book |last=Asimov |first=Isaac |authorlink=Isaac Asimov |title=[[Foundation's Edge]] |edition= |series=[[Foundation Series]] |date= |year=1982 |month= |publisher=Doubleday &amp; Company |location=United States |isbn=0-385-17725-9 |pages= 33–35|chapter=Chapter Three, Historian |quote= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the beginning of ''Foundation's Edge'' the Mayor of the Foundation notices Pelorat's existence for the first time and promises him that she will arrange for him to travel to Trantor.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Asimov |first=Isaac |authorlink=Isaac Asimov |title=[[Foundation's Edge]] |edition= |series=[[Foundation Series]] |date= |year=1982 |month= |publisher=Doubleday &amp; Company |location=United States |isbn=0-385-17725-9|chapter=Chapter Three, Historian |quote= |page= 35 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Mayor informs him that he will travel to Trantor with the exiled councilman [[Golan Trevize]].

Upon leaving [[Terminus (planet)|Terminus]] on the small space ship ''Far Star'', he and [[Golan Trevize]] begin their search for Earth. With only the two of them on board, Golan Trevize informs Pelorat that, as pilot and the person in control of the ship, he has decided they will not to go to Trantor but instead to seek out Earth directly with the information they already have.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Asimov |first=Isaac |authorlink=Isaac Asimov |title=[[Foundation's Edge]] |edition= |series=[[Foundation Series]] |date= |year=1982 |month= |publisher=Doubleday &amp; Company |location=United States |isbn=0-385-17725-9|chapter=Chapter Six, Earth |quote= |page= 95 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Instead of finding Earth, by way of the planet [[Sayshell]], they find [[Gaia (Asimov)|Gaia]], a world which has developed a group consciousness, and is rumored to have destroyed any ships that have been sent to it. While on Gaia, Janov falls in love with a member of Gaia, [[Blissenobiarella|Bliss]]. It is these three characters, Golan, Janov, and Bliss, with the addition of Fallom that continue the search for Earth in ''[[Foundation and Earth]]''.

Sir '''John Thomas Gilbert''' (b. in [[Dublin]], 23 January 1829; d. there, 23 May 1898) was an Irish archivist, antiquarian and historian.

==Life==

John Thomas Gilbert was the second son of John Gilbert, an English Protestant, who was Portuguese consul in Dublin, and Marianne Gilbert, an Irish Catholic, daughter of Henry Costello. He was born in Jervis Street, Dublin. His early days were spent at Branackstown, [[County Meath]]. He was educated at Bective College, Dublin, and at [[Prior Park College|Prior Park]], near [[Bath, Somerset|Bath]], England. He received no university training, as his mother was unwilling for him to attend [[Trinity College, Dublin]] - at that time the only university in Dublin. In 1846 his family moved to [[Blackrock, Dublin|Blackrock]], a Dublin suburb, where he resided until his death, fifty-two years later.&lt;ref&gt;Gilbert, Rosa Mulholland. [https://archive.org/stream/lifeofsirjohntgi00gilb#page/n7/mode/2up ''Life of Sir John T. Gilbert, LL.D., F.S.A., Irish historian and archivist, vice-president of the Royal Irish academy, secretary of the Public record office of Ireland'']. London: Longmans, 1905.&lt;/ref&gt;

Aged nineteen, he was elected to the Council of the Celtic Society, and thus became associated with some of the famous writers and orators of the age: [[Isaac Butt|Butt]], Duffy, [[Samuel Ferguson|Ferguson]], [[John Mitchel|Mitchel]], O'Hagan, and [[William Smith O'Brien|Smith O'Brien]]. His essay "Historical Literature of Ireland" appeared in 1851, and four years later he became a Member of the [[Royal Irish Academy]], and secretary of the Irish Celtic and Archaeological Society, whose members included [[John O'Donovan (scholar)|O'Donovan]], [[Eugene O'Curry|O'Curry]], [[Alfred Graves|Graves]], [[James Henthorn Todd|Todd]], and [[William Wilde|Wilde]]. In 1862 he was awarded the Royal Irish Academy's [[Cunningham Medal]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.ria.ie/getmedia/3b7984d2-3580-4438-9d55-08ae8ded4e4e/Cunningham-Medal-2008---Seamus-Heaney.pdf.aspx |title=Cunningham Medal|publisher=Royal Irish Academy|accessdate=11 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Taking on the most important posts in the historical and antiquarian societies, he became librarian of the [[Royal Irish Academy]] for thirty-four years. In 1891 he married the Irish novelist [[Rosa Mulholland]]. He received the honorary degree of LL.D. from the Royal University in 1892, and five years later was knighted for his services to archaeology and history.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title = Ireland. Irish New Year Honours | publisher = [[The Times]], Issue 35090 | location = London | page = 6; col D | date = 2 January 1897| archiveurl = | archivedate= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Gilbert Library, in Dublin's [[Pearse Street, Dublin|Pearse Street]], is named after him.

==Works==

*''History of the City of Dublin (1854-9)'', in three volumes. 
*''History and Treatment of the Public Records of Ireland'' (1863) which caused considerable sensation, arguing to the government the futility of entrusting the publication of Irish State documents to men unskilled in the Irish language. 
*''History of the Viceroys of Ireland'' (1865) 
*''Calendar of the Ancient Records of Dublin (7 vols., 1889–98)''
*''History of the Irish Confederation and the War in Ireland, 1641-9 (7 vols., 1882–91)''
*''Jacobite Narrative of the War in Ireland, 1688-91'' (1892).

Celtic scholars are indebted to him for photographic reproductions of ancient Irish manuscripts, for the establishment of the Todd lectureship in Celtic, and also for editions of ''[[Lebor na hUidre|Leabhar na h-Uidhre]]'' and ''[[An Leabhar Breac|Leabhar Breac]]''.

'''Joseph Norbert Leon François Marie Ghislain "José" Anne de Molina''' (born 2 September 1925) is a [[Belgium|Belgian]] magistrate, heraldist, and historian.

==Family==
The Anne de Molina family was first ennobled in 1750, with the ennoblement of the brothers Josephus Adrianus and Carolus Lambertus Anne, both [[schepen|aldermen]] in the City of [[Dendermonde]]. Victor Anne (1819–1891), the latter's grandson, received a recognition of nobility in 1871 and was authorized to add "de Molina" to his last name in 1885.

José Anne de Molina is a grandson of Victor Anne and the son of Raphaël Anne de Molina (1893-1977), president of the Brussels Court of Appeal, and of Germaine, Baroness de Viron (1894–1978). In 1956, he married Marie-Claire de Meeûs (1931), a daughter of Georges, Count de [[Meeûs d'Argenteuil]]. They have five children.

==Biography==
Anne de Molina was born in [[Brussegem]].

After becoming a [[Doctor of Law]], José Anne de Molina went on to build a career in the judicial system, first as a lawyer and later as a magistrate. He started out as a judge at the [[Court of First Instance (Belgium)|Court of First Instance]] in Brussels, and went on to be a counsellor, president of the chamber and finally first president at the Brussels [[Court of Appeal]]. Furthermore, he was a substitute first president at the Military Tribunal.

He is the honorary president of the ''Office généalogique et héraldique de Belgique'' ("Genealogical and Heraldic Office of Belgium"). In February 1986, he became a member of the [[Council of Nobility]] and was its president from October 1986 until November 1989. In 1960, he co-founded the ''[[État présent de la noblesse belge]]''.

He is a Commander in the [[Order of the Holy Sepulchre]].

The '''KOF Index of Globalisation''' is an [[List of globalization-related indices|index]] of the degree of [[globalisation]] of 122 countries.{{r|axel|page=29}} It was conceived by [[Axel Dreher]] at the Konjunkturforschungsstelle of [[ETH Zurich]], in Switzerland. It was first published in 2002, and covered the period from 1970 until that year.{{r|marco|page=46}} A new version of it was published in 2017.{{r|axel|page=29}}

The index is based on three principal criteria: economic, political and social.{{r|marco|page=46}} Unlike the [[Maastricht Globalisation Index]], it does not take into account [[Environmental quality|environmental]] factors.{{r|axel|page=29}}

'''Leopoldo Óváry''' (born '''Óváry Lipót''') (31 December 1833, [[Veszprém]] - 4 April 1919, [[Budapest]]) was a [[Hungary|Hungarian]] historian and custodian of the [[National Archives (Hungary)|Hungarian state archives]]. He took part in the [[The Revolutions of 1848 in the Habsburg areas|Hungarian struggle for liberty]] in 1848 and in the [[Austro-Sardinian War|Italian war of independence]] in 1859. After the political troubles had been settled he devoted himself to the study of history, in which he soon achieved distinction. In 1876 he was appointed assistant custodian of the state archives, in 1904 chief custodian; and in 1892 he was elected a member of the Hungarian Academy of Sciences. A knighthood of the [[Order of the Crown of Italy]] was conferred upon him.

Óváry's writings had considerable political influence, especially those attacking the [[Anti-Hungarian sentiment|anti-Hungarian]] [[Romania]]n propaganda in [[Italy]]. His chief works include: ''Nápolyi Történelmi Kutatások'' (Budapest, 1874); ''III. Pál Pápa s Farnese Sándor Bibornok Magyarországra Vonatkozó Diplomácziai Levelezései'' (ib. 1879); ''Oklevéltár Bethlen Gábor Diplomácziai Összeköttetéseinek Történetéhez'' (ib. 1886); ''Zsigmond Királly és az Olasz Diplomaczia'' (ib. 1889); ''A Magyar Anjouk Eredete'' (ib. 1893); ''La Questione Dacoromana e lo Stato Ungherese'' (Rome, 1894; German ed., Budapest, 1894; French ed., Paris, 1894). Óváry embraced [[Christianity]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1689">Sabe is a territory located in present-day [[Benin]], based in and around the town of [[Savé]]

In the [[Yoruba language]], the word [[Oba (king)|Oba]] means '''king''' or '''ruler'''. It is also common for the obas of the various [[Yoruba people|Yoruba]] domains to have their own special titles. In '''Sabe''' the Oba is referred to as the '''Onisabe of Sabe'''

Records for Sabe are fragmentary and conflicting, containing a long succession of rulers styled ''Ola''. It is suggested by one source that recent rulers alternate between descendants of either of two brothers.

The list presented here represents a fragment of the record.

{{Campaignbox Rhodesian Bush War}}

The '''Rhodesian Bush War'''—also called the '''Second Chimurenga''' and the '''Zimbabwe War of Liberation'''—was a civil conflict from July 1964 to December 1979{{#tag:ref|The start and end of the war are difficult to precisely date.

|p=1069}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The conflict pitted three forces against one another: the Rhodesian government, led by [[Ian Smith]] (later the Zimbabwe-Rhodesian government of Bishop [[Abel Muzorewa]]); the [[Zimbabwe African National Liberation Army]], the military wing of [[Robert Mugabe]]'s [[Zimbabwe African National Union]]; and the [[Zimbabwe People's Revolutionary Army]] of [[Joshua Nkomo]]'s [[Zimbabwe African People's Union]].

The war and its subsequent [[Internal Settlement]], signed in 1978 by Smith and Muzorewa, led to the implementation of [[universal suffrage]] in June 1979 and the end of [[Dominant minority|white minority rule]] in Rhodesia, which was renamed [[Zimbabwe Rhodesia]] under a black majority government. However, this new order failed to win international recognition and the war continued. Neither side achieved a military victory and a compromise was later reached.&lt;ref name=k;a;vav&gt;M Evans, [http://afsaap.org.au/assets/1991_Evans-Michael.pdf Making an African army: the case of Zimbabwe, 1980–87], Peace, Politics and Violence in the New South Africa, 1992 – afsaap.org.au. Retrieved December 26, 2015. "The Rhodesian-Zimbabwean bush war ended in a military stalemate. The ZANU government came to office following a Commonwealth-controlled ceasefire and a British-supervised election. As Mugabe put it: 'We did not win a military victory. We achieved a political settlement. A compromise.'"&lt;/ref&gt;

Negotiations between the government of Zimbabwe-Rhodesia, the UK Government and Mugabe and Nkomo's united "[[Zimbabwe African National Union – Patriotic Front|Patriotic Front]]" took place at [[Lancaster House]], London in December 1979, and the [[Lancaster House Agreement]] was signed. The country returned temporarily to British control and new elections were held under British and [[Commonwealth of Nations|Commonwealth]] supervision in March 1980. ZANU won the election and Mugabe became the first [[Prime Minister of Zimbabwe]] on 18 April 1980, when the country achieved internationally recognised independence.

==Background==
The origin of the war in [[Rhodesia]] can be traced to the conquest of the region by the [[British South Africa Company]] in the late-19th century, and the dissent of native leaders who opposed foreign rule.&lt;ref name="Rogers 1998, p. 37"&gt;{{Harvnb|Rogers|1998|p=37}}&lt;/ref&gt; Britons began settling in Southern Rhodesia from the 1890s, and while it was never accorded full [[dominion]] status, these settlers effectively governed the country after 1923. 

In his famous "[[Wind of Change (speech)|Wind of Change]]" speech, [[Prime Minister of the United Kingdom|UK Prime Minister]] [[Harold Macmillan]] revealed Britain's new policy to only permit independence to its African colonies under majority rule.&lt;ref name=wessels6873/&gt; But many white Rhodesians were concerned that such immediate change would cause chaos [[Congo Crisis|as had resulted]] in the former [[Belgian Congo]] after its independence in 1960.&lt;ref name="wessels6873"&gt;{{Harvnb|Wessels|2010|pp=68–73}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Britain's unwillingness to compromise led to Rhodesia's [[Unilateral Declaration of Independence (Rhodesia)|unilateral declaration of independence]] (UDI) on 11 November 1965. Although Rhodesia had the private support of neighbouring South Africa and [[Estado Novo (Portugal)|Portugal]], which still owned [[Portuguese Mozambique|Mozambique]], it never gained formal diplomatic recognition from any country.&lt;ref name="wood2008p6"&gt;{{Harvnb|Wood|2008|p=6}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="smith109116"&gt;{{Harvnb|Smith|1997|pp=109–116}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although the vote in Rhodesia was constitutionally open to all, regardless of race, property requirements left many blacks unable to participate.&lt;ref name="pbharris"&gt;{{Harvnb|Harris|1969|pp=72–80}}&lt;/ref&gt; The new 1969 constitution reserved eight seats in the [[Politics of Rhodesia#1969 ('UDI') Constitution|66 seat parliament]] for "Non-Europeans" only, with a further eight reserved for tribal chiefs.

Amidst this backdrop, [[African nationalist]]s advocated armed struggle to bring about black rule, primarily denouncing the wealth disparity between the races. Two rival nationalist organisations emerged in August 1963: the [[Zimbabwe African People's Union]] (ZAPU) and the [[Zimbabwe African National Union]] (ZANU), after disagreements about tactics, as well as tribalism and personality clashes.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Sibanda|2005
|p=321}}&lt;/ref&gt; ZANU and its military wing [[ZANLA]] were headed by [[Robert Mugabe]] and consisted primarily of [[Shona language|Shona]] tribes. ZAPU and its military wing [[ZIPRA]] consisted mainly of [[Northern Ndebele people|Ndebele]] under [[Joshua Nkomo]].&lt;ref name="Rogers 1998, p. 37"/&gt;

===Cold War politics===
[[Cold War]] politics played into the conflict. The [[Soviet Union]] supported ZIPRA and China supported ZANLA. Each group fought a separate war against the Rhodesian security forces, and the two groups sometimes fought against each other as well.&lt;ref name="bennett"&gt;{{Harvnb|Bennett|1990|p=25}}&lt;/ref&gt; In June 1979, the governments of [[Cuba]] and [[Mozambique]] offered direct military help to the [[Zimbabwe African National Union – Patriotic Front|Patriotic Front]], but Mugabe and Nkomo declined.&lt;ref name="direct"&gt;{{Harvnb|Preston|2004|p=55}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other foreign contributions included from North Korea military officials who taught Zimbabwean militants to use explosives and arms in a camp near [[Pyongyang]].&lt;ref name="wessels130"&gt;{{Harvnb|Wessels|2010|p=130}}&lt;/ref&gt; By April 1979, 12,000 ZANLA guerrillas were training in [[Tanzania]], [[Ethiopia]], and [[Libya]] while 9,500 of its 13,500 extant cadres operated in Rhodesia.&lt;ref name="endingwar"&gt;{{Harvnb|Preston|2004|p=66}}&lt;/ref&gt; On the other side of the conflict, South Africa clandestinely gave material and military support to the Rhodesian government.&lt;ref name=wood2008p6/&gt;

Inevitably, the Bush War occurred within the context of regional Cold War in Africa, and became embroiled in conflicts in several neighbouring countries. Such conflicts included the [[Angolan War of Independence]] (1961–1975) and [[Angolan Civil War]] (1975–2002), the [[Mozambican War of Independence]] (1964–1974) and [[Mozambican Civil War]] (1977–1992), the [[South African Border War]] (1966–1989), and the [[Shaba I]] (1977) and [[Shaba II]] (1978) conflicts.&lt;ref name="binda105"&gt;{{Harvnb|Binda|2008|p=105}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Perceptions===
The conflict was seen by the nationalist groups and the UK Government of the time as a war of national and racial liberation. The Rhodesian government saw the conflict as a fight between one part of the country's population (the Whites) on behalf of the whole population (including the black majority) against several externally financed parties made up of predominantly Black [[Radicalization|radicals]] and communists. The Nationalists considered their country occupied and dominated by a foreign power, namely Britain, since 1890.&lt;ref name="binda48"&gt;{{Harvnb|Binda|2008|p=48}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The British government, in the person of the [[Governor of Southern Rhodesia|Governor]], had indirectly ruled the country from 1923, when it took over from the [[British South Africa Company]] and granted [[self-governing colony|self-governing status]] to a locally elected government, made up predominantly of whites. Ian Smith's [[Rhodesian Front]] party was elected to power in 1962 and [[Rhodesia's Unilateral Declaration of Independence|unilaterally declared independence]] on 11 November 1965 to preserve what it saw as the self-government it had possessed since 1923.&lt;ref name="binda48"&gt;{{Harvnb|Binda|2008|p=48}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Rhodesian government contended that it was defending Western values, Christianity, the [[rule of law]] and democracy by fighting Communists; however, it was unwilling to compromise on most political, economic and social inequalities. The Smith administration claimed that the legitimate voice of the black Shona and Ndebele population were the traditional chiefs and ZANU and ZAPU nationalists, who it regarded as dangerous, violent usurpers.&lt;ref name="wood2008542"&gt;{{Harvnb|Wood|2008|pp=542–555}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1978–1979, the Smith administration tried to blunt the power of the nationalist cause by acceding to an "Internal Settlement" which ended minority rule, changed the name of the country to [[Zimbabwe-Rhodesia]], and arranged multiracial elections, which were held [[Zimbabwe Rhodesia general election, 1979|in 1979]] and won by Bishop [[Abel Muzorewa]], who became the country's first Black head of government. However, unsatisfied with this and spurred on by Britain's refusal to recognise the new order, the nationalist forces persisted.

Ultimately the war ended when, at the behest of both South Africa (its major supporter) and the United States, the Zimbabwe-Rhodesian government ceded power to Britain in the [[Lancaster House Agreement]] in December 1979. The UK Government held another election [[Southern Rhodesian general election, 1980|in 1980]] to form a new government. The election was won by ZANU. The new government, headed by [[Robert Mugabe]], was recognised internationally, and the country was  renamed [[Zimbabwe]].

===Rhodesian Security Forces===

[[File:Rhodesian African Rifles, Lake Kariba, December 1976, 3.png|thumb|upright|Two soldiers of the [[Rhodesian African Rifles]] aboard a patrol boat on [[Lake Kariba]], December 1976. Black Rhodesians made up most of the government's [[Rhodesian Security Forces|Security Forces]], but some units were all-white.&lt;ref name=lohman3/&gt;]] Despite the effect of economic and diplomatic sanctions, Rhodesia was able to develop and maintain a powerful and professional military.&lt;ref name="Rogers 1998, p. 41"&gt;{{Harvnb|Rogers|1998|p=41}}&lt;/ref&gt; In June 1977, ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' magazine reported that "man for man, the Rhodesian army ranks among the world's finest fighting units."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=The World: The Military: A Mission Impossible |url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,919001,00.html |work=[[Time (magazine)|Time]] |location=New York |date=13 June 1977 |accessdate=3 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The army was always relatively small, just 3,400 regular troops in 1970.&lt;ref name="Britannica 1971 259"&gt;{{Harvnb|Britannica|1971|p=259}}&lt;/ref&gt; By 1978–79 it had grown to some 10,800 regulars nominally supported by about 40,000 reservists – although by the last year of the war, perhaps as few as 15,000 were available for active service. While the regular army consisted of a professional core of white soldiers (and some units, such as the [[Rhodesian SAS]] and the [[Rhodesian Light Infantry]], were all-white), by 1978–1979 the rest was majority black.&lt;ref name="lohman3"&gt;{{Harvnb|Lohman|MacPherson|1983|loc=chpt. 3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By contrast, army reserves were largely white, and toward the end of the war were increasingly called up to deal with the growing insurgency. The regular army was supported by the para-military [[British South Africa Police]] of about 8,000 to 11,000 men (the majority of whom were black) and 19,000 to 35,000 police reservists (which, like their army counterparts, were largely white). The police reserves acted as type of home guard.&lt;ref name="lohman3"&gt;{{Harvnb|Lohman|MacPherson|1983|loc=chpt. 3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The war saw the extensive operation of Rhodesian regulars as well as elite units such as the [[Selous Scouts]] and the [[Rhodesian Special Air Service|Rhodesian SAS]]. The [[Rhodesian Army]] fought bitterly against the black nationalist guerrillas. The Rhodesian Army also comprised mostly black regiments such as the [[Rhodesian African Rifles]]. As the war went on, the frequent call-up of reservists was increasingly used to supplement the professional soldiers and the many volunteers from overseas.&lt;ref name="abbott17"&gt;{{Harvnb|Abbott|Botham|1986|p=17}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="binda186188"&gt;{{Harvnb|Binda|2008|pp=186–188}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By 1978, all white men up to the age of 60 were subject to periodic call-up to the army; younger men up to 35 might expect to spend alternating blocks of six weeks in the army and at home. Many of the overseas volunteers came from Britain, Ireland, South Africa, Portugal, Hong Kong, Canada, Australia, New Zealand and the United States of America with the latter three being held in high regard for their recent [[Vietnam War]] experience.&lt;ref name="abbott17"&gt;{{Harvnb|Abbott|Botham|1986|p=17}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="binda186188"&gt;{{Harvnb|Binda|2008|pp=186–188}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Considering the [[United Nations Security Council Resolution 232|arms embargo]], the Rhodesian Army was well-equipped. The standard infantry weapon was the Belgian [[FN FAL]] Rifle as produced in South Africa under license as the R1 Rifle and supplemented by the [[H&amp;K G3]] rifle that came from Portuguese forces. However, other weapons such as the British L1A1 ('SLR') variant of the FAL and the older British [[Lee–Enfield]] [[bolt-action]] rifle were used by reservists and the [[British South Africa Police]]. Other weapons included the [[Bren]] LMG in both .303" and 7.62mm NATO, [[Sten]] SMG, [[Uzi]], [[Browning Hi-Power]] pistol, Colt [[M16 rifle]] (very late in the war), [[FN MAG]] (FN MAG58) general-purpose machine-gun, [[L16 81mm Mortar|81 mm mortar]], and [[M18A1 Claymore Antipersonnel Mine|Claymore]] mines. After [[Rhodesia's Unilateral Declaration of Independence|UDI]], Rhodesia was heavily reliant on South African and domestically produced weapons and equipment, as well as international smuggling operations, commonly referred to as "sanction-busting".&lt;ref name=smith109116/&gt; South Africa provided extensive support to Rhodesia in the form of a Lend / Lease program and both the official and unofficial support of many branches of the South African armed forces.

The [[Rhodesian Air Force]] (RhAF) operated a variety of equipment and carried out numerous roles, with air power providing the Rhodesians with a significant advantage over their guerrilla enemy.&lt;ref name="Rogers 1998, p. 41"/&gt; The fleet consisted mainly of British aircraft and largely obsolete aircraft, such as the [[World War II]] vintage [[C-47 Skytrain|Douglas Dakota]] transport aircraft and the British [[de Havilland Vampire]].  The arms embargo caused a lack of spare parts from external suppliers and RhAF had to find alternative means to keep its aircraft flying. The larger South African Air Force provided extensive training, aircraft and aircrews in support of RhAF operations from 1966.  The Rhodesians also used more modern types of aircraft like the [[Hawker Hunter]] and [[English Electric Canberra|Canberra]] bombers, the [[Cessna Skymaster]] as well as [[Aérospatiale Alouette III]] (SA316) helicopters until they were supplemented by the [[Bell 205|Agusta Bell 205]].&lt;ref name="Rogers 1998, p. 41"/&gt; Very late in the war, the Rhodesian forces were able to smuggle and use very few Agusta Bell [[UH-1 Iroquois]] helicopters.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Brent|1987|p=14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At the beginning of the war, much of Rhodesia's military hardware was of British and [[Commonwealth of Nations|Commonwealth]] origin, but during the course of the conflict, new equipment such as [[Eland Mk7|Eland armoured cars]] were procured from South Africa. Several Polish-made [[T-55]] tanks destined for [[Idi Amin]]'s regime in Uganda were diverted to Rhodesia by the South Africans, in the last year of the war.&lt;ref name="bindaQuartz"&gt;{{Harvnb|Binda|2008|pp=462–472}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Rhodesians also produced a wide range of wheeled [[MRAP|mine-proofed armoured vehicles]], often using Mercedes [[Unimog]], [[Land Rover]] and [[Bedford trucks|Bedford]] truck components, including unlicensed copies of the [[Mercedes-Benz]] [[UR-416]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Reid-Daly|Stiff|1983|p=425}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the course of the war, most white citizens carried personal weapons, and it was not unusual to see white housewives carrying [[submachine gun]]s. A [[siege mentality]] set in and all civilian transport had to be escorted in convoys for safety against ambushes. Farms and villages in rural areas were frequently attacked by guerrillas.

The Rhodesian government divided the country into eight geographical operational areas: North West Border (Operation Ranger), Eastern Border (Operation Thrasher), North East Border (Operation Hurricane), South East Border (Operation Repulse), Midlands (Operation Grapple), Kariba (Operation Splinter), Matabeleland (Operation Tangent), [[Harare|Salisbury]] and District ("SALOPS").

===Nationalist guerrilla forces===
The two major armed groups campaigning against [[Ian Smith]]'s government were the [[Zimbabwe African National Liberation Army]] (ZANLA), the armed wing of the [[Zimbabwe African National Union]] (ZANU), and the [[Zimbabwe People's Revolutionary Army]] (ZIPRA), the armed wing of the [[Zimbabwe African People's Union]] (ZAPU). The fighting was largely rural, as the two rival movements tried to win peasant support and to recruit fighters while harassing the administration and the white civilians. To ensure local domination, ZANLA and ZIPRA sometimes fought against each other as well as against the security forces.&lt;ref name=bennett/&gt;

====ZANLA====
{{Main article|Zimbabwe African National Liberation Army}}
ZANLA was the armed wing of ZANU.&lt;ref name="binda48"/&gt; The organisation also had strong links with [[Mozambique]]'s independence movement, [[FRELIMO]]. ZANLA, in the end, was present on a more or less permanent basis in over half the country, as evidenced by the location of the demobilisation bases at the end of the war, which were in every province except [[Matabeleland North]].&lt;ref name="demobbases"&gt;{{Harvnb|Martin|Johnson|1981|p=321}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, they were fighting a civil war against ZIPRA, despite the formation of a joint front by their political parties after 1978.&lt;ref name=bennett/&gt; It was ZANLA's intention to occupy the ground, supplant the administration in rural areas, and then mount the final conventional campaign. ZANLA concentrated on the politicisation of the rural areas using force, persuasion, ties of kinship and collaboration with spirit mediums.&lt;ref name="kriger51"&gt;{{Harvnb|Kriger|2003|p=51}}&lt;/ref&gt;

ZANLA tried to paralyse the Rhodesian effort and economy by planting Soviet anti-tank [[land mine]]s on the roads. From 1972 to 1980 there were 2,504 vehicle detonations of land mines (mainly Soviet TM46s), killing 632 people and injuring 4,410. Mining of roads increased 33.7% from 1978 (894 mines or 2.44 mines were detonated or recovered per day) to 1979 (2,089 mines or 5.72 mines a day).&lt;ref name="woodsummary"&gt;{{cite news |title=Rhodesian Insurgency |last=Wood |first=J.

In response, the Rhodesians co-operated with the South Africans to develop a range of mine protected vehicles. They began by replacing air in tyres with water which absorbed some of the blast and reduced the heat of the explosion. Initially, they protected the bodies with steel deflector plates, sandbags and mine conveyor belting. Later, purpose built vehicles with V shaped blast hulls dispersed the blast and deaths in such vehicles became unusual events.{{#tag:ref|These developments subsequently led to the South African Hippo, [[Casspir]], Mamba and [[RG-31|Nyala]] wheeled light troop carriers.|group="n"}}&lt;ref name="woodpookie"&gt;{{cite news |title=The Pookie: a History of the World's first successful Landmine Detector Carrier |last=Wood |first=J.

====ZIPRA====
{{Main article|Zimbabwe People's Revolutionary Army}}
ZIPRA was the anti-government force based around the [[Northern Ndebele people|Ndebele]] ethnicity, led by [[Joshua Nkomo]], and the ZAPU political organisation. In contrast to ZANLA's [[Mozambique]] links, Nkomo's ZIPRA was more oriented towards [[Zambia]] for local bases. However, this was not always with full Zambian government support: by 1979, the combined forces based in Zambia of ZIPRA, ''[[Umkhonto we Sizwe]]'' (the armed wing of the [[African National Congress]] of South Africa) and South-West African [[SWAPO]] fighters were a major threat to Zambia's internal security. Because [[ZAPU]]'s political strategy relied more heavily on negotiations than armed force, ZIPRA grew slower and less elaborately than ZANLA, but by 1979 it had an estimated 20,000 combatants, almost all based in camps around Lusaka, Zambia.

ZIPRA was responsible for two attacks on civilian [[Air Rhodesia]] Viscount aeroplanes, [[Air Rhodesia Flight 825|on 3 September 1978]] and [[Air Rhodesia Flight 827|12 February 1979]]. Using [[Strela 2|SA-7]] [[surface-to-air missile]]s, the guerrillas shot down each plane during its ascent from Kariba Airport.&lt;ref name=viscount1/&gt;&lt;ref name=viscount2/&gt; ZIPRA took advice from its Soviet instructors in formulating its vision and strategy of popular revolution. About 1,400 Soviets, 700 East German and 500 Cuban instructors were deployed to the area.&lt;ref name="newsatelier"&gt;{{cite news |title=Afrikaserie: Simbabwe (Africa Series: Zimbabwe) |first=Walter |last=Doebler |location=Ottersweier |url=http://www.newsatelier.de/html/simbabwe.html |work=newsatelier.de |language=German |date=22 July 2006 |accessdate=19 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On the advice of the Soviets, ZIPRA built up its conventional forces, and motorised with Soviet armoured vehicles and a number of small aeroplanes,&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Dabengwa|1995|loc=chpt. ZIPRA in the Zimbabwe War of National Liberation}}&lt;/ref&gt; in Zambia. ZIPRA's (i.e. ZAPU's) intention was to allow ZANLA to bring the Rhodesian forces to the point of defeat, and then take the victory from the much lighter forces of ZANLA and the essentially defeated Rhodesians. ZIPRA kept a light presence within Rhodesia, reconnoitring, keeping contact with the peasants and sometimes skirmishing with ZANLA.&lt;ref name="Dabengwa 1995 48–72"&gt;{{Harvnb|Dabengwa|1995|pp=48–72}}&lt;/ref&gt;

ZIPRA's conventional threat partly distracted Rhodesian forces from fighting ZANLA. By the late 1970s, ZIPRA had developed a strategy known as ''Storming the Heavens'' to launch a conventional invasion from Zambia, supported by a limited number of armoured vehicles and light aircraft. An operation by the Rhodesian armed forces to destroy a ZIPRA base near Livingstone in Zambia was never launched.&lt;ref name="Dabengwa 1995 48–72"/&gt;

The ZAPU/ZIPRA strategy for taking over Zimbabwe proved unsuccessful. In any event, the transfer of power to black nationalists took place not by the military take-over expected by ZAPU/ZIPRA, but by a peaceful and internationally supervised election. Rhodesia reverted briefly to British rule, and a general election took place in early 1980. This election was supervised both by the UK and international forces.

Robert Mugabe (of ZANLA/ZANU) won this election, because he was the only major competitor of the majority ethnicity, Shona. Once in power, Mugabe was internationally recognised as Zimbabwe's leader and was installed as head of government, and had the backing of the overwhelming majority ethnic group. He was therefore able to quickly and irreversibly consolidate his power, forcing ZAPU, and therefore ZIPRA which was ZAPU's army, to give up hope of taking over the country in the place of ZANU/ZANLA.

==Pre-war events==

===Civil disobedience (1957–1964)===
[[File:Rhodesialand.png|thumb|upright=1.3|In 1962, Rhodesia was split about equally between black ''(orange and purple)'' and white ''(yellow)'' areas. The ruling [[United Federal Party]] proposed the removal of racially defined boundaries, except for reserved Tribal Trust Lands ''(orange)'', which made up about 45% of the country.&lt;ref name=windrich4245/&gt;|alt=A map. See description]]

In September 1956, bus fares in [[Harare|Salisbury]] were raised so high that workers were spending 18% to 30% of their earnings on transportation.&lt;ref name=tightrope/&gt; In response, the [[City Youth League]] boycotted the United Transport Company's buses and succeeded in preventing the price change. On 12 September 1957 members of the Youth League and the defunct ANC formed the [[Southern Rhodesia African National Congress]], led by Joshua Nkomo. The [[Edgar Whitehead|Whitehead administration]] banned the SRANC in 1959 and arrested 307 leaders, excluding Nkomo who was out of the country, on 29 February in Operation Sunrise.&lt;ref name="events"/&gt;&lt;ref name="tightrope"&gt;{{Harvnb|Muzondidya|2005|pp=167–170}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="nonviolent"&gt;{{Harvnb|Lake|1976|p=32}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Nkomo, Mugabe, [[Herbert Chitepo]], and [[Ndabaningi Sithole]] established the National Democratic Party in January 1960. Nkomo became its leader in October. An NDP delegation headed by Nkomo attended the constitutional conference in January 1961. While Nkomo initially supported the constitution, he reversed his position after other NDP leaders disagreed. The government banned the NDP in December 1961 and arrested NDP leaders, excluding Nkomo who, again, was out of the country. Nkomo formed the [[Zimbabwe African People's Union]] which the Whitehead administration banned in September 1962.&lt;ref name="events"/&gt;&lt;ref name="tightrope"/&gt;&lt;ref name="nonviolent"/&gt;

The [[United Federal Party]] (UFP) had been in power since 1934, earning it the nickname of "the establishment", and roughly represented Southern Rhodesian commercial and major agricultural interests.&lt;ref name=windrich42&gt;{{Harvnb|Windrich|1975|p=42}}&lt;/ref&gt; The UFP contested the [[Southern Rhodesian general election, 1962|1962 general election]] on a ticket of racial "partnership", whereby blacks and whites would work together.&lt;ref name=windrich4245&gt;{{Harvnb|Windrich|1975|pp=42–45}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Smith|1997|pp=46–47}}&lt;/ref&gt; All ethnically discriminatory legislation would be immediately repealed, including the Land Apportionment Act, which defined certain areas of the land as eligible for purchase only by blacks, others as exclusively for whites, and others as open for all races.&lt;ref name=windrich4245/&gt;

About 45% of the country was split in this way; another 45% comprised reserved Tribal Trust Lands, which housed tribesmen, and gave local chiefs and headmen a degree of self-government in a similar manner to American [[Indian reservation]]s. The remainder was national land. The country had originally been split up in this way during the early days of white immigration to prevent the new arrivals from using their superior finances to buy all of the land in the country.&lt;ref name=windrich4245/&gt;

The UFP proposed to repeal the black and white purchase areas, but keep the Tribal Trust and national lands.&lt;ref name=windrich4245/&gt; It also committed to general black advancement. These proposals proved largely repugnant to the mostly white electorate, which feared that premature black ascendancy would threaten Rhodesia's economic prosperity and security, as well as their own personal affairs.&lt;ref name=windrich4245/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Smith|1997|pp=43–47}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Most turned away from the ruling UFP party, causing it to lose in the 1962 election to the newly formed [[Rhodesian Front]] (RF), a conservative party opposed to any immediate shift to black rule.&lt;ref name=windrich4245&gt;{{Harvnb|Windrich|1975|pp=42–45}}&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Winston Field]] and [[Ian Smith]] became Prime Minister and Deputy Prime Minister, respectively.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Smith|1997
|p=47}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nkomo, legally barred from forming a new party, moved ZAPU's headquarters to [[Dar es Salaam]], Tanzania.&lt;ref name="nonviolent"/&gt;

In July 1963, Nkomo suspended [[Ndabaningi Sithole]], [[Robert Mugabe]], [[Leopold Takawira]], and [[Washington Malianga]] for their opposition to his continued leadership of ZAPU.&lt;ref name="bio"&gt;{{harvnb|Cary|Mitchell|1977|p=101}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 8 August, they announced the establishment of the [[Zimbabwe African National Union]]. ZANU members formed a militant wing, the [[Zimbabwe African National Liberation Army]], and sent ZANLA members to the People's Republic of China for training.&lt;ref name="nonviolent"/&gt;

==Course of the war==

===First phase (1964–1972)===
[[File:RhodesiaAllies1965.png|thumb|The geopolitical situation at the time of UDI on 11 November 1965. Rhodesia is coloured green, countries friendly to the nationalists are coloured orange and countries friendly to the government (South Africa and Portugal) are shown in purple.]]

On 4 July 1964, ZANU insurgents ambushed and murdered a white foreman from Silverstreams Wattle Company, Pieter Johan Andries (Andrew) Oberholzer. The killing had a lasting effect on the small, close-knit white community, even though it was an isolated incident.&lt;ref name="binda38"&gt;{{Harvnb|Binda|2008|p=38}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="cilliers4"&gt;{{Harvnb|Cilliers|1984|p=4}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Rogers 1998, p. 39"&gt;{{Harvnb|Rogers|1998|p=39}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Smith administration detained ZANU and ZAPU leaders in August 1964. The major leaders imprisoned were [[Ndabaningi Sithole]], [[Leopold Takawira]], [[Edgar Tekere]], [[Enos Nkala]] and [[Maurice Nyagumbo]]. The remaining military leaders of the ZANLA Dare ReChimurenga were [[Josiah Tongogara]] and the barrister [[Herbert Chitepo]]. Operating from bases in [[Zambia]] and later from [[Mozambique]], militants began launching attacks against Rhodesia.&lt;ref name="beginning"&gt;{{Harvnb|St. John|2007|p=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The conflict intensified after Rhodesia'a [[Unilateral Declaration of Independence (Rhodesia)|Unilateral Declaration of Independence]] (UDI) from Britain on 11 November 1965.&lt;ref name="Rogers 1998, p. 39"/&gt; [[International sanctions|Sanctions]] ([[embargo]]) were imposed by Britain and endorsed by member states of the United Nations. The embargo meant the Rhodesia was hampered by a lack of modern equipment but it used other means to receive vital war supplies such as [[Petroleum|oil]], munitions, and arms via the [[apartheid]] government of South Africa. War material was also obtained through elaborate international smuggling schemes, domestic production, and captured infiltrating enemy combatants.&lt;ref name=smith109116/&gt;

Five months later, on 28 April 1966, the Rhodesian Security Forces engaged militants in [[Sinoia]], during the [[Sinoia battle|first major engagement of the war]].&lt;ref name="events"/&gt; Seven ZANLA men were killed, and in retaliation the survivors killed two civilians at their farm near Hartley three weeks later.&lt;ref name="Rogers 1998, p. 39"/&gt;

During Portuguese rule of Mozambique, until 1974–1975, Rhodesia was able to defend its border with Zambia relatively easily and prevent many guerrilla incursions. It set up a strong defense along the [[Zambezi River]] running from [[Lake Kariba]] to the Mozambique border. Here 30-man camps were established at 8-kilometre intervals supported by mobile rapid reaction units. From 1966 to 1970, these defences accounted for 175 insurgents killed for the loss of 14 defenders.&lt;ref name="Britannica 1971 259"/&gt; The conflict continued at a low level until 21 December 1972 when ZANLA conducted the [[attack on Altena Farm]] in north-east Rhodesia. In response, the Rhodesians moved to attack nationalists in their foreign camps and staging areas before they could infiltrate into Rhodesia.&lt;ref name="Rogers 1998, pp. 39-40"&gt;{{Harvnb|Rogers|1998|pp=39–40}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Secret cross-border operations by the [[Rhodesian Special Air Service|Special Air Service]] began in the mid-1960s, with Rhodesian Security Forces already engaging in hot pursuits into Mozambique. However, three weeks after the attack on Altena Farm, ZANLA killed two civilians and abducted a third into Mozambique and then Tanzania. In response, SAS troops were inserted into Mozambique with the approval of the Portuguese administration, in the first officially sanctioned external operation. The Rhodesian government began authorising an increasing number of external operations.&lt;ref name="Rogers 1998, pp. 39-40" /&gt;

In the first phase of the conflict (until the end of 1972), Rhodesia's political and military position was strong. Nationalist guerrillas did not make serious inroads. In the early 1970s, the two main nationalist groups faced serious internal divisions, aid from the [[Organisation of African Unity]] was temporarily suspended in 1971, and 129 nationalists were expelled from Zambia after they were alleged to have plotted against President [[Kenneth Kaunda]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Britannica|1972|p=235}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Britain's efforts to isolate Rhodesia economically had not produced major compromises by the Smith Government. Indeed, late in 1971 the British and Rhodesian Governments had negotiated a compromise political settlement which would have bowed to the Smith Government's agenda of postponing majority rule into the indefinite future. Nevertheless, when it was found that such a delayed approach to majority rule was unacceptable to most of Rhodesia's African population, the deal fell apart.&lt;ref name="Ryan"&gt;{{Harvnb|Ryan|2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1971, Rhodesia joined [[Alcora Exercise]], a secret defensive alliance for Southern Africa, formalised in 1970 by Portugal and South Africa. Alcora formalised and deepened the political and military co-operation between the three countries against the revolutionary insurgency in Rhodesia, Angola, Mozambique and [[South West Africa]] and against the hostile neighbouring countries.

However, the end of Portuguese rule in Mozambique created new military and political pressures on the Rhodesian Government to accept the principle of immediate majority rule.

===Second phase (1972–1979)===
{{for|Rhodesian Army counter-insurgency tactics|Fireforce}}
[[File:Rhodesian reservists on patrol.jpg|thumb|upright|Rhodesian reservist soldiers on patrol with [[FN FAL]] rifles during the 1970s.]]
The black nationalists continued to operate from secluded bases in neighbouring [[Zambia]] and from [[FRELIMO]]-controlled areas in the Portuguese colony of [[Mozambique]], making periodic raids into [[Rhodesia]]. By 1973, guerrilla activity was increasing in the aftermath of the Altena Farm raid, particularly in the northeast part of the country where portions of the African population were evacuated from border areas, and compulsory military service for whites was extended to one year.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Britannica|1974|p=600}}&lt;/ref&gt; As the war intensified, conscription was raised to men between the ages of 38 and 50, though this was modified in 1977. No white male 17-year-olds were allowed to leave the country. 

In April 1974, the left-wing [[Carnation Revolution]] in Portugal heralded the coming end of colonial rule in Mozambique. A transitional government was formed within months and Mozambique became independent under FRELIMO rule on 25 June 1975. Such events proved beneficial to ZANLA and disastrous for the Rhodesians, adding 800 miles of hostile border.&lt;ref name="Rogers 1998, p. 40"&gt;{{Harvnb|Rogers|1998|p=40}}&lt;/ref&gt; Indeed, with the demise of the [[Portuguese Empire]], Ian Smith realised Rhodesia was surrounded on three sides by hostile nations and declared a formal state of emergency. Soon Mozambique closed its border, however Rhodesian forces continued to cross the border in "hot pursuit" raids, attacking the nationalists and their training camps, and engaged in skirmishes with Mozambican security forces.&lt;ref name="timehotpursuit"&gt;{{cite news |title=Rhodesia: Make Peace or Face War |url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,879623,00.html |work=Time |location=New York |date=8 March 1976 |accessdate=19 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By 1975–1976, it was clear that an indefinite postponement of majority rule, which had been the cornerstone of the Smith Government's strategy since UDI, was no longer viable. Even overt South African support for Rhodesia was waning. South Africa began scaling back economic assistance to Rhodesia, placed limits on the amount of fuel and munitions being supplied to the Rhodesian military, and withdrew the personnel and equipment they had previously provided to aid the war effort, including a border police unit that had been helping guard the Rhodesia-Zambia border.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Britannica|1976|pp=619–620}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1976, the length of active military service was extended to 18 months; this took effect immediately, with soldiers about to end their one-year service finding their active service extended. Even after discharge from regular service, white men entered the reserve forces, and were often called up for duty, White men were often subjected to long military service. In addition, Rhodesia recruited black men to volunteer for military service; by 1976, half of the Rhodesian Army was composed of black soldiers. Although some raised questions about their loyalty, the Rhodesian government stated that it had no doubts about their loyalty, and planned to train black officers. Legislation to conscript blacks was introduced and came in effect in 1979, but the response to call-ups was poor. Rhodesia also recruited foreign volunteers for service, with groups of foreigners who served in Rhodesia including the [[The Crippled Eagles|Crippled Eagles]] and [[7 Independent Company (Rhodesia)|7 Independent Company]].&lt;ref name=fall&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.popularsocialscience.com/2012/10/19/the-fall-of-rhodesia/ |title=The Fall of Rhodesia |publisher=Popularsocialscience.com |date=19 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/latimes/access/681613642.html?dids=681613642:681613642&amp;FMT=ABS&amp;FMTS=ABS:AI&amp;type=historic&amp;date=Nov+26%2C+1976&amp;author=&amp;pub=Los+Angeles+Times&amp;desc=Rhodesia+to+Seek+More+Black+Soldiers&amp;pqatl=google |title=Los Angeles Times: Archives – Rhodesia to Seek More Black Soldiers |publisher=Pqasb.pqarchiver.com |date=26 November 1976}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Black Conscription Protestors Arrested |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1946&amp;dat=19781125&amp;id=XgMuAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=XaEFAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=5461,2563770 |accessdate=14 October 2014 |work=The Montreal Gazette |agency=Reuters |date=25 November 1978}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Rhodesians add six months to Conscription |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=muZVAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=HuEDAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=6527,1218119 |accessdate=14 October 2014 |work=Eugene Register-Guard |agency=UPI |date=5 May 1976}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Many Blacks ignore call-up in Rhodesia |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1301&amp;dat=19790112&amp;id=fv9jAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=UOcDAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=3506,2527817 |accessdate=14 October 2014 |work=The Sydney Morning Herald |agency=AAP-Reuter |date=12 January 1979}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Late in 1976, Ian Smith accepted the basic elements of the compromise proposals made by US Secretary of State [[Henry Kissinger]] to introduce majority rule within two years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=White rule in Rhodesia to end |publisher=BBC |location=London |date=23 September 1976 |accessdate=19 October 2011 |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/onthisday/hi/dates/stories/september/24/newsid_2537000/2537969.stm}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Smith Government then sought to negotiate an acceptable settlement with moderate black leaders, while retaining strong white influence in key areas. The Rhodesian military, in turn, aimed to erode the rising military strength of the ZANLA and ZIPRA to the greatest extent possible in order "buy time" for an acceptable political settlement to be reached.

As the war continued to intensify, the Rhodesian Security Forces initiated a Chemical and Biological Weapons (CBW) programme to kill guerrillas both inside Rhodesia and in external camps in Zambia and Mozambique. The effort had three fronts.&lt;ref name="Glenn Cross 1980"&gt;Glenn Cross, "Dirty War: Rhodesia and Chemical Biological Warfare, 1975-1980," Solihull, UK: Helion &amp; Company, 2017&lt;/ref&gt; First, it aimed to eliminate guerrillas operating inside Rhodesia through contaminated supplies either provided by contact men, recovered from hidden caches, or stolen from rural stores.&lt;ref&gt;Ed Bird. Special Branch War: Slaughter in the Rhodesian Bush Southern Ndebele land, 1976-1980. Solihull, UK: Helion &amp; Company, Ltd. 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; 

Secondly, it aimed to contaminate water supplies along guerrilla infiltration routes into Rhodesia, forcing the guerrillas to either travel through arid regions to carry more water and less ammunition or travel through areas patrolled by the security forces.&lt;ref&gt;Jim Parker, "Assignment Selous Scouts: The Inside Story of a Rhodesian Special Branch Officer". Johannesburg, South Africa: Galago Press, 2006&lt;/ref&gt; Finally, the Rhodesians sought to hit the guerrillas in their camps in Mozambique by poisoning food, beverages, and medicines.

The chemicals most used in the Rhodesian program were [[parathion]] (an organophosphate insecticide) and [[Thallium poisoning|thallium]] (a heavy metal commonly found in rodenticide).&lt;ref&gt;Chandré Gould and Peter Folb. "Project Coast: Apartheid’s Chemical and Biological Warfare Programme". Geneva: [[United Nations Institute for Disarmament Research]], 2002.&lt;/ref&gt; Biological agents the Rhodesians selected for use also included ''Vibrio cholerae'' (causative agent of [[cholera]]) and possibly ''Bacillus anthracis''  (causative agent of [[anthrax]]).  They also looked at using ''Rickettsia prowazekii'' (causative agent of [[epidemic typhus]]), and ''Salmonella typhi'' (causative agent of [[typhoid fever]]), and toxins—such as ricin and [[botulinum toxin]].&lt;ref name="Glenn Cross 1980"/&gt;

====Nyadzonya raid====
{{main article|Operation Eland}}
The Rhodesian Security Forces called up part-time soldiers in preparation for a major counter-offensive on 2 May 1976.&lt;ref name="parttime"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1976/05/02/archives/rhodesia-planning-offensive-to-call-up-parttime-soldiers.html |title=Rhodesia, planning offensive, to call up part-time soldiers |work=[[The New York Times]] |date=1 May 1976 |accessdate=19 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 9 August 1976, Rhodesian [[Selous Scouts]] aided by former ZANLA commander Morrison Nyathi attacked a ZANLA camp at Nyadzonya in Mozambique containing over 5,000 guerrillas and several hundred refugees. The Selous Scouts, who numbered 72, dressed in FRELIMO uniforms and disguised their vehicles, attaching FRELIMO licence plates and painting them in FRELIMO colours. White soldiers wore black ski masks. They crossed the unmanned border into Mozambique at 0005 hours on 9 August and drove through the early morning to the camp, passing several FRELIMO sentries who saluted them as they went by.&lt;ref name="lohman4"&gt;{{Harvnb|Lohman|MacPherson|1983|loc=chpt. 4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When they reached the ZANLA camp at 0825 hours the six ZANLA soldiers on duty allowed them to enter, and the Rhodesian vehicles moved in and took up prearranged positions around the edge of the parade ground, on which stood about 4,000 guerrillas. When all was ready a Rhodesian soldier took his vehicle loudspeaker and announced, in Shona, "''Zimbabwe tatora''", meaning "we have taken Zimbabwe", and Nyathi blew a whistle signalling the cadres to muster. The cadres began cheering and ran towards the vehicles, packing around them as more ran onto the parade ground from other areas of the camp.&lt;ref name="lohman4"&gt;{{Harvnb|Lohman|MacPherson|1983|loc=chpt. 4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Rhodesians then opened fire and continued shooting until there was no movement on the parade ground, then they returned to Rhodesia. More than 1,000 ZANLA insurgents were reported killed by the Rhodesians, with four Selous Scouts lightly wounded. This figure is corroborated by ZANLA's official report,{{#tag:ref|The official ZANLA report, dated 19 August 1976, specifies that before the raid, on 9 August 1976, there had been 5,250 people in the camp, of whom 604 were refugees. It goes on to say that afterwards 1,028 had been killed, 309 had been wounded and around 1,000 had gone missing.&lt;ref name=lohman4/&gt;|group="n"}} though publicly both ZANLA and ZIPRA claimed that Nyadzonya had been a refugee camp.&lt;ref name="lohman4"&gt;{{Harvnb|Lohman|MacPherson|1983|loc=chpt. 4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Later, on 7 October 1976, militants bombed a railroad bridge over Matetsi River when a train carrying ore passed over.&lt;ref name="matetsi"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1976/10/08/archives/rhodesia-says-rebels-bomb-bridge-sending-train-crashing-into-river.html |title=Rhodesia says rebels bomb bridge, sending train crashing into river |work=The New York Times |date=8 October 1976 |accessdate=19 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Escalation of the war (1977)====

Eight adults, all dead, the bodies of their four children lying beside them; one a three-week-old girl.}}&lt;/ref&gt;]] By 1977, the war had spread throughout Rhodesia. ZANLA continued to operate from Mozambique and remained dominant among the Mashona peoples in eastern and central Rhodesia. Meanwhile, ZIPRA remained active in the north and west, using bases in Zambia and Botswana, and were mainly supported by the Ndebele tribes.&lt;ref name="Rogers 1998, p. 40"/&gt; With this escalation came sophistication, organisation and modern weapons for the guerillas, and although many were still untrained, an increasing number were trained in Communist bloc and other sympathetic countries.&lt;ref name="Rogers 1998 40–41"&gt;{{Harvnb|Rogers|1998|pp=40–41}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Side box|text=Weapons fielded included [[TT pistol]]s, [[PPSh-41]] submachine guns, [[AK-47]] &amp; [[AKM]] assault rifles, [[SKS]] semi-automatic carbines, [[RPD]] and [[RPK]] light machine guns, as well as [[RPG-2]] and [[RPG-7]] rocket propelled grenade launchers and various Soviet [[grenades]]. The Rhodesians only discovered how well equipped the nationalists had become when raids on guerrilla base areas towards the end of the war revealed mortars, 12.7mm and 14.5mm heavy machine guns and even heavier calibre weapons such as 122mm multiple rocket launchers.&lt;ref name="Rogers 1998 40–41"/&gt;}}

On the 3rd April 1977, General [[Peter Walls]] announced that the government would launch a campaign to win the "hearts and minds" of Rhodesia's black citizens.&lt;ref name="psyop"&gt;{{Harvnb|Friedman|2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; In May, Walls received reports of [[ZANLA]] forces massing in the city of [[Mapai, Mozambique|Mapai]] in [[Gaza Province]], Mozambique. Prime Minister Smith gave Walls permission to destroy the base. Walls told the media the Rhodesian forces were changing tactics from contain and hold to [[search and destroy]], "adopting hot pursuit when necessary."

On the 30th May 1977, during [[Operation Aztec]], 500 troops crossed the Mozambican border and travelled {{convert|60|mi|km}} to Mapai, engaging the [[ZANLA]] forces with air cover from the Rhodesian Air Force and paratroopers in [[C-47 Dakotas]]. The Rhodesian government said the military killed 32 ZANLA fighters and lost one Rhodesian pilot. The Mozambican government disputed the number of casualties, saying it shot down three Rhodesian planes and a helicopter and took several troops prisoner, all of which was denied by Minister of Combined Operations, Roger Hawkins.&lt;ref name="mapai"&gt;{{Harvnb|Kalley|1999|p=224}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="gamble"&gt;{{cite news |title=Rhodesia: Smith Takes a Dangerous New Gamble |url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,919000,00.html |location=New York |work=Time |date=13 June 1977 |accessdate=19 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="tactics"&gt;{{cite news |title=Rhodesia: Getting ready for war |url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,879724,00.html |location=New York |work=Time |date=24 May 1976 |accessdate=19 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Kurt Waldheim]], the [[Secretary-General of the United Nations]], condemned the incident on the 1st June, and Walls announced a day later that the Rhodesian military would occupy [[Mapai, Mozambique|Mapai]] until they had eliminated ZANLA's presence.  But the American, British, and Soviet governments also condemned the raid&lt;ref name="mapai"/&gt; and Rhodesian forces later withdrew from the area. The [[United Nations Security Council]] denounced the incursion of the "illegal racist minority regime in Southern Rhodesia" in [[United Nations Security Council Resolution 411|Resolution 411]], on the 30th June 1977.&lt;ref name="denouncillegal"&gt;{{cite web |title=United Nations Security Council Resolution 411 |publisher=United Nations |date=30 June 1977 |title-link=wikisource:United Nations Security Council Resolution 411 }}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Militants [[Salisbury Woolworths bombing|bombed a Woolworths department store]] in [[Harare|Salisbury]] on 6 August 1977, killing 11 and injuring 70.&lt;ref name="woolsworth"&gt;{{Harvnb|Muzondidiya|2005|p=246}}&lt;/ref&gt; They killed 16 black civilians in eastern Rhodesia on 21 August, burning their homes on a white-owned farm.&lt;ref name="random"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1977/08/22/archives/16-rhodesian-blacks-reported-killed-by-guerrillas.html |title=16 Rhodesian blacks reported killed by guerrillas |work=The New York Times |date=22 August 1977 |accessdate=19 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; In November 1977, in response to the buildup of ZANLA guerrillas in Mozambique, Rhodesian forces launched [[Operation Dingo]], a pre-emptive combined arms surprise attack on guerrilla camps at Chimoio and Tembue in Mozambique. The attack was carried out over three days, from 23 to 25 November 1977. While these operations reportedly inflicted thousands of casualties on Robert Mugabe's ZANLA cadres, probably blunting guerrilla incursions in the months that followed, nevertheless a steady intensification of the insurgency continued through 1978.

To disrupt FRELIMO's hold on Mozambique, the Rhodesian [[Central Intelligence Organisation]] helped to create and support an insurgency movement within Mozambique. This guerrilla group, known as [[RENAMO]], battled with FRELIMO even as Rhodesian forces fought the ZANLA within Mozambique.

In December 1978, a ZANLA unit penetrated the outskirts of Salisbury and fired a volley of rockets and incendiary device rounds into the main oil storage depot. The storage tanks burned for five days, giving off a column of smoke that could be seen 80 miles (130&amp;nbsp;km) away. Half a million barrels of petroleum product—a quarter of Rhodesia's fuel—was destroyed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.rmi.org/Knowledge-Center/Library/S83-08_FragileDomEnergy |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2015-11-13 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151117063613/http://www.rmi.org/Knowledge-Center/Library/S83-08_FragileDomEnergy |archivedate=17 November 2015 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1978, 450 ZANLA militants entered Mozambique and attacked the town of [[Mutare|Umtali]]. At the time, ZANU said the militants were women, an unusual characteristic, but in 1996 [[Joyce Mujuru]] said the vast majority involved were men and ZANU concocted the story to make Western organisations believe women were involved in the fighting.&lt;ref name="concoction"&gt;{{Harvnb|Lyons|2004|p=167}}&lt;/ref&gt; In retaliation for these acts, the Rhodesian Air Force bombed guerrilla camps 125 miles inside Mozambique, using 'fatigued' [[English Electric Canberra|Canberra B2]] aircraft and [[Hawker Hunter]]s – actively, but clandestinely, supported by several of the more capable Canberra B(I)12 aircraft of the [[South African Air Force]]. A number of joint-force bomber raids on guerrilla encampments and assembly areas in Mozambique and Zambia were mounted in 1978, and extensive air reconnaissance and surveillance of guerrilla encampments and logistical build-up was carried out by the [[South African Air Force]] on behalf of the RhAF.

====Airliners shot down====
Rhodesian external operations extended into Zambia after Nkomo's ZIPRA nationalists shot down two unarmed [[Vickers Viscount]] civilian airliners with Soviet-supplied [[SA-7 Grail|SA-7]] heat-seeking missiles. Encamped beneath the path of ascent towards Salisbury from Kariba Airport, the ZIPRA cadres downed [[Air Rhodesia Flight 825]] on 3 September 1978 and [[Air Rhodesia Flight 827]] on 12 February 1979. In the first incident, eighteen civilians on board survived, and five of these went away to find water. Half an hour later nine ZIPRA fighters arrived, promising help; three of the thirteen survivors hid when they saw them. In the words of ''Time'' magazine, the ZIPRA cadres "herded together the ten people at the wreckage, robbed them of their valuables, and finally cut them down with automatic weapons fire". Nkomo claimed responsibility for the attack and spoke of it to the [[BBC]] in a way Rhodesians considered gloating.&lt;ref name="viscount1"&gt;{{cite news |title=Rhodesia: Seeds of Political Destruction |url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,916377,00.html |location=New York |work=Time |date=18 September 1978 |accessdate=20 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the second attack all 59 people on board were killed in the crash.&lt;ref name="viscount2"&gt;{{cite news |title=59 killed in Viscount Disaster |work=The Rhodesia Herald |date=13 February 1979 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In retaliation for the shooting down of Flight 825 in September 1978, Rhodesian Air Force Canberra bombers, Hunter fighter-bombers and helicopter gunships attacked the ZIPRA guerrilla base at Westlands farm near Lusaka in October 1978, warning Zambian forces by radio not to interfere.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Moorcraft|McLaughlin|2008|pp=140–143}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The increased effectiveness of the bombing and follow-up 'air mobile' strikes using [[C-47 Skytrain|Dakota]]-dropped parachutists and helicopter 'air cav' techniques had a significant effect on the development of the conflict. As late as September 1979, despite the increased sophistication of guerrilla forces in Mozambique, a raid by Selous Scouts, with artillery and air support, on "New Chimoio" still reportedly resulted in heavy ZANLA casualties.{{#tag:ref|The increased guerrilla capabilities were evident during that raid in that the insurgents, now armed with Soviet surface-to-air missiles, were able to shoot down a Rhodesian helicopter, killing all 12 on board.&lt;ref name="beckett2"&gt;{{Harvnb|Beckett|2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;|group="n"}} However, a successful raid on the Rhodesian strategic fuel reserves in [[Harare|Salisbury]] also underscored the importance of concluding a negotiated settlement and achieving international recognition before the war expanded further.

====Military pressure====
The larger problem was that by 1979, combined ZIRPA and ZANLA strength inside Rhodesia totalled at least 12,500 guerrillas and it was evident that insurgents were entering the country at a faster rate than the Rhodesian forces could kill or capture. In addition, 22,000 ZIPRA and 16,000 ZANLA fighters remained uncommitted outside the country.&lt;ref name=beckett2/&gt; Joshua Nkomo's ZIPRA forces were preparing their forces in Zambia with the intent of confronting the Rhodesians through a conventional invasion. Whether such an invasion could have been successful in the short term against the well trained Rhodesian army and air force is questionable. However, what was clear was that the insurgency was growing in strength daily and the ability of the security forces to continue to control the entire country was coming under serious challenge.&lt;ref name=lohman4/&gt;

By putting the civilian population at risk, ZIPRA and the ZANLA had been particularly effective in creating conditions that accelerated white emigration. This not only seriously undermined the morale of the white population, it was also gradually reducing the availability of trained reserves for the army and the police. For a discussion see: {{Main article|Rhodesia Regiment}} The economy was also suffering badly from the war; the Rhodesian GDP consistently declined in the late 1970s.&lt;ref name=beckett2/&gt; Part of the economic decline was due to white men being called up for extended periods of military service, which also affected many Rhodesian families.{{citation needed|date=June 2013}}

Politically, the Rhodesians were therefore pinning all their hopes on the "internal" political settlement that had been negotiated with moderate black nationalist leaders in 1978 and its ability to achieve external recognition and support. This internal settlement led to the creation of [[Zimbabwe-Rhodesia]] under a new constitution in 1979.

===Resolution===
Under the agreement of March 1978, the country was renamed [[Zimbabwe-Rhodesia]], and in the general election of 24 April 1979, Bishop [[Abel Muzorewa]] became the country's first black prime minister. On 1 June 1979, [[Josiah Zion Gumede]] became President. The internal settlement left control of the military, police, civil service, and judiciary in white hands, and assured whites about one-third of the seats in parliament. It was essentially a power-sharing arrangement between whites and blacks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/onthisday/hi/dates/stories/june/1/newsid_2492000/2492915.stm |title=BBC ON THIS DAY &amp;#124; 1 &amp;#124; 1979: End of white rule in Rhodesia |publisher=BBC News |date=18 April 1980}}&lt;/ref&gt; The factions led by Nkomo and Mugabe denounced the new government as a puppet of white Rhodesians and fighting continued. The hoped for recognition of the internal settlement, and of Zimbabwe-Rhodesia, by the newly elected [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative]] government of [[Margaret Thatcher]] did not materialise after the [[United Kingdom general election, 1979|latter's election]] in May 1979. Likewise, although the US Senate voted to lift sanctions against Zimbabwe-Rhodesia, the [[Carter administration]] also refused to recognise the internal settlement.

While Prime Minister Thatcher clearly sympathized with the internal settlement and thought of the ZANLA and ZIPRA leaders as terrorists, she was prepared to support a push for further compromise if it could end the fighting.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Margaret Thatcher blocked talks with 'Terrorist' Mugabe |url=http://www.mg.co.za/article/2009-12-30-margaret-thatcher-blocked-talks-with-terrorist-mugabe |first=Katherine |last=Haddon |location=London |publisher=[[Mail &amp; Guardian]] |date=30 December 2009 |accessdate=19 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Britain was also reluctant to recognise the internal settlement for fear of fracturing the unity of the [[Commonwealth]]. Thus later in 1979, the Thatcher government called a peace conference in London to which all nationalist leaders were invited.&lt;ref name="Rogers 1998 65"&gt;{{Harvnb|Rogers|1998|p=65}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:ZIPRA battalion.jpg|thumb|Member of the Commonwealth Monitoring Force supervising a ZIPRA assembly point.]]
The outcome of this conference would become known as the [[Lancaster House Agreement]]. During the conference, the Zimbabwe-Rhodesian Government accepted a watering down of the 1978 internal settlement while Mugabe and Nkomo agreed to end the war in exchange for new elections in which they could participate. The economic sanctions imposed on Rhodesia were lifted in late 1979, and the country reverted to temporary British rule until elections could be held. Under the Constitution of Zimbabwe-Rhodesia (Amendment) (No. 4) Act 1979 of 11 December 1979, the country formally reverted to its colonial status as Southern Rhodesia. The Zimbabwe-Rhodesian parliament voted itself out of power, and [[Christopher Soames, Baron Soames|Lord Soames]] was appointed by the British government to rule the country as Governor-Designate, arriving in Salisbury on 12 December to take over from President Gumede.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/onthisday/hi/dates/stories/december/11/newsid_3950000/3950445.stm |title=BBC ON THIS DAY &amp;#124; 11 &amp;#124; 1979: Rhodesia reverts to British rule |publisher=BBC News |date=11 December 1941}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 21 December 1979, a cease-fire was announced.&lt;ref name="Rogers 1998 65"/&gt; An election was scheduled for early 1980. The British Commonwealth deployed an observer force, the Commonwealth Monitoring Force, to the country for the transitional period. Britain contributed 800 soldiers and 300 [[Royal Air Force]] personnel, along with small naval and marine contingents. Australia, [[Fiji]], [[Kenya]], and [[New Zealand]] also contributed smaller numbers of troops. A nine-man British advance party arrived on 8 December to begin establishing a logistics base, and this was followed by the arrival of the main force shortly after.&lt;ref name=britains-smallwars&gt;{{cite web |url=http://britains-smallwars.com/RRGP/Agila/Sunset.htm |title=The British Empire's Last Sunset |publisher=Britains-smallwars.com |date= |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=http://archive.wikiwix.com/cache/20130703060205/http://britains-smallwars.com/RRGP/Agila/Sunset.htm |archivedate=3 July 2013 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The war would end in a military stalemate.&lt;ref name=k;a;vav /&gt;  However, the political compromise which was reached after combat ceased would work to the advantage of the black nationalists, especially those aligned with [[ZANU]] leader [[Robert Mugabe]].&lt;ref name=k;a;vav /&gt; Mugabe himself stated in an interview published in the April 28, 1980 edition of the [[New York Times]] "We did not win a military victory... We reached a political settlement... A compromise."&lt;ref name=k;a;vav /&gt; 

During the [[Zimbabwean parliamentary election, 1980|election of 1980]], there were accusations of voter intimidation by Mugabe's guerrilla cadres, sections of which were accused of not having assembled in the designated guerrilla assembly points as required under the Lancaster House Agreement, and the international observers as well as Lord Soames were accused of looking the other way. The Rhodesian military may have seriously considered a coup d'état in March 1980.&lt;ref name=bindaQuartz/&gt; This alleged coup was to consist of two stages: [[Operation Quartz]], coordinated attacks on guerrilla assembly points within the country, and Operation Hectic, the assassination of Mugabe and his key aides.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.rhodesia.nl/quartz.htm |title=Operation Quartz – Rhodesia 1980 |publisher=Rhodesia.nl |date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, even in the context of alleged voter intimidation by ZANLA elements, widespread support for Mugabe from large sections of the black population (in particular from the [[Shona people|Shona]] language group which made up the overwhelming majority of the country's population) could not be seriously disputed. Moreover, the clear absence of any external support for such a coup, and the inevitable conflagration that would have engulfed the country thereafter, scuttled the plan.&lt;ref name=bindaQuartz/&gt;

The election of early 1980 was won by Mugabe, who became prime minister after [[Zimbabwe African National Union - Patriotic Front|ZANU-PF]] received 63% of the vote. By 16 March 1980, all Commonwealth forces except for some 40 infantry instructors who temporarily stayed behind to train the new nation's army had departed.&lt;ref name=britains-smallwars/&gt; On 18 April 1980, interim British rule ended and the country was internationally recognised as independent. The colony of Southern Rhodesia was formally renamed Zimbabwe, and on 18 April 1982, the government changed the name of the country's capital from Salisbury to [[Harare]].

==Aftermath==
{{Main article|Zimbabwe|Robert Mugabe}}
According to Rhodesian government statistics, more than 20,000 were killed during the war. From December 1972 to December 1979, 4,160 members of the Rhodesian security forces were killed, along with 10,050 guerrillas who were killed in Rhodesia, and an unknown number in Mozambique and Zambia, 7,790 black civilians, and 468 white civilians.&lt;ref name=fall/&gt;

After he assumed power, [[Robert Mugabe]] acted incrementally to consolidate his power, forming a coalition government with his ZAPU rivals and the white minority. The Rhodesian Army was merged with guerrilla forces to form the [[Zimbabwe Defence Forces]], and the Rhodesian security forces were merged with ZANLA and ZIPRA forces. Joshua Nkomo was given a series of cabinet positions.

However, Mugabe was torn between keeping his coalition stable and pressures to meet the expectations of his followers for social change. Clashes between ZANLA and ZIPRA forces took place in 1980 and 1981. In February 1982, Mugabe fired Nkomo and two other ZAPU ministers from his cabinet, triggering bitter fighting between ZAPU supporters in [[Northern Ndebele language|Ndebele]]-speaking region of the country and the ruling ZANU. Between 1982 and 1985, the military crushed armed resistance from Ndebele groups in [[Matabeleland]] and the [[Midlands, Zimbabwe|Midlands]] in a military crackdown known as ''[[Gukurahundi]]'', a Shona term which translates roughly to mean "the early rain which washes away the chaff before the spring rains". The ''Gukurahundi'' campaigns were also known as the Matabeleland Massacres.&lt;ref name="watch"&gt;{{Harvnb|Nyarota|2006
|p=134}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Zimbabwean military's North Korean-trained [[Zimbabwean Fifth Brigade|Fifth Brigade]] was deployed to Matabeleland to crush resistance. German journalist Shari Eppel estimates approximately 20,000 Matabele were murdered in these first years after the war;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Eppel|2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; most of those killed were victims of public executions.{{citation needed|date=April 2016}}

Violence between ZANLA and ZIPRA continued until 1987. In December 1987, the two groups reached an accord which saw them merge into one party known as [[ZANU PF]], headed by Mugabe. Mugabe then became President and gained additional powers, as the office of Prime Minister was abolished.{{citation needed|date=April 2016}}

Beyond Zimbabwe's borders, as a result of Rhodesian aid and support for [[RENAMO]], the Rhodesian Bush War also helped influence the outbreak of the [[Mozambique Civil War]], which lasted from 1977 until 1992. That conflict claimed over a million lives, and made some 5 million people homeless.{{citation needed|date=April 2016}}

==Biography==
Toscano was born in 1872 in [[Guadalajara, Jalisco]].&lt;ref name="director1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="toscano1"/&gt;  He began studying to become a mining engineer, however changed his career to become  a filmmaker.&lt;ref name="toscano1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="encarta1"/&gt; He used a [[Cinematograph]] camera and projector which was first introduced in France in 1895.&lt;ref name="toscano1"/&gt; It was introduced into Mexico a year later when the first presentation of film in Mexico was made on 15 August 1896.&lt;ref name="toscano1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="standish1"/&gt;

Toscano opened Mexico's first public movie theatre at 17 Jesús María Street in Mexico City in 1897.&lt;ref name="toscano1"/&gt;&lt;ref name=raat35/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Noble, p. 59&lt;/ref&gt; In the public theater he showed such famous early films as ''[[The Great Train Robbery (1903 film)|The Great Train Robbery]]'', ''[[A Trip to the Moon]]'', and ''The Kingdom of the Fairies''.&lt;ref name="toscano1"/&gt;

Toscano began his movie career by filming local scenes in Mexico and local news events.&lt;ref name="toscano1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="encarta1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="standish1"/&gt; Some early short film titles of these, made in 1896 and 1897, were ''Men in Scuffle on the Main Square'' and ''Rural Police Riding Their Horses.''&lt;ref name="standish1"/&gt;

Toscano began full length production filming in 1898, directing and producing his own movies.&lt;ref name="toscano1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="encarta1"/&gt; They were mostly documentaries pertaining to Mexico.&lt;ref name="toscano1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="encarta1"/&gt; Toscano was the producer of the first full-length film in Mexico.&lt;ref name="toscano1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="encarta1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="bethell521"/&gt;&lt;ref name=raat35/&gt; It was fiction based on the play ''[[Don Juan Tenorio]]''.&lt;ref name="toscano1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="encarta1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="mexcinema1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="bethell521"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Noble, p. 27&lt;/ref&gt; The film was made in 1898 starring the Mexican actor Paco Gavilanes.&lt;ref name="toscano1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="bethell521"&gt;Bethell, p. 521, ''The first man in Mexico to make a primitive fiction film was Salvador Toscano Barragan (1872-1941), in 1898, with the first of many film versions of that nineteenth-century romantic staple, "Don Juan Tenorio."''&lt;/ref&gt;

Toscano was a documentary filmmaker mostly however. He filmed on the [[Mexican Revolution]] and most of his movie making was on this subject.&lt;ref name="toscano1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="encarta1"/&gt;

Toscano had a rival named Enrique Rosas who also produced films in Mexico at the same time.&lt;ref name="standish1"/&gt; Many movie theaters had been constructed by 1902 in Mexico City and within a few years many more were spread throughout Mexico.&lt;ref name="standish1"/&gt; Toscano's last film was shot in 1921.&lt;ref name="toscano1"/&gt;

Toscano's daughter [[Carmen Toscano|Carmen]] took many scenes of his Mexican revolutionary documentary films and reintroduced it under the title of ''[[Memories of a Mexican|Memorias de un mexicano]]'' (''Memoirs of a Mexican'') in 1950.&lt;ref name="toscano1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="encarta1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="mexcinema1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="standish1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="noble1"&gt;Noble, p. 58-9 and p. 195&lt;/ref&gt; The scenes were filmed by Toscano between 1897 and 1923. Much of the footage was about [[Mexican president|President]] [[Porfirio Díaz]] and the revolutionary events of his reign.&lt;ref name="toscano1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="encarta1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="standish1"/&gt;&lt;ref name=raat35/&gt;&lt;ref name="noble1"/&gt; The reintroduced film was 100 minutes long and premiered 24 August 1950.&lt;ref name="toscano1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="encarta1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="standish1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="noble1"/&gt;

One of the propaganda "photo-ops" Toscano made of Díaz was called ''General Díaz on a Stroll Through [[Chapultepec Park]].''&lt;ref name="standish1"/&gt; Toscano also made documentary films of Díaz's grand celebration of Mexico's first one hundred years of independence.&lt;ref name="standish1"/&gt;

Since 1982 the movie industry of Mexico has awarded the [[Salvador Toscano Medal]] in recognition of outstanding contribution to Mexican [[cinematography]].&lt;ref&gt;Jaszczak, p. 348&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''history of science during the [[Age of Enlightenment]]''' traces developments in [[science]] and [[technology]] during the [[Age of Reason]], when Enlightenment ideas and ideals were being disseminated across [[Europe]] and [[North America]]. Generally, the period spans from the final days of the 16th and 17th-century [[Scientific revolution]] until roughly the 19th century, after the [[French Revolution]] (1789) and the [[Napoleonic era]] (1799–1815). The scientific revolution saw the creation of the first [[Learned society|scientific societies]], the rise of [[Heliocentrism|Copernicanism]], and the displacement of [[Aristotelianism|Aristotelian natural philosophy]] and [[Galen|Galen’s]] ancient medical doctrine. By the 18th century, scientific authority began to displace religious authority, and the disciplines of [[alchemy]] and [[astrology]] lost scientific credibility.

While the Enlightenment cannot be pigeonholed into a specific doctrine or set of dogmas, science came to play a leading role in Enlightenment discourse and thought. Many Enlightenment writers and thinkers had backgrounds in the sciences and associated scientific advancement with the overthrow of religion and traditional authority in favour of the development of free speech and thought. Broadly speaking, Enlightenment science greatly valued [[empiricism]] and rational thought, and was embedded with the Enlightenment ideal of advancement and progress. As with most Enlightenment views, the benefits of science were not seen universally; [[Jean-Jacques Rousseau]] criticized the sciences for distancing man from nature and not operating to make people happier.&lt;ref&gt;Burns (2003), entry: 7,103.&lt;/ref&gt;

Science during the Enlightenment was dominated by scientific societies and [[Academy|academies]], which had largely replaced universities as centres of scientific research and development. Societies and academies were also the backbone of the maturation of the scientific profession. Another important development was the [[popular culture|popularization]] of science among an increasingly literate population. [[Philosophe]]s introduced the public to many scientific theories, most notably through the ''[[Encyclopédie]]'' and the popularization of [[Newtonianism]] by [[Voltaire]] as well as by Émilie du Châtelet, the French translator of Newton's Principia. Some historians have marked the 18th century as a drab period in the [[history of science]];&lt;ref&gt;see Hall (1954), iii; Mason (1956), 223.&lt;/ref&gt; however, the century saw significant advancements in the practice of [[medicine]], [[mathematics]], and [[physics]]; the development of biological [[Taxonomy (biology)|taxonomy]]; a new understanding of [[magnetism]] and [[electricity]]; and the maturation of [[chemistry]] as a discipline, which established the foundations of modern chemistry.

==Universities==

[[File:Original Yale College Building.jpg|thumb|230px|right|The original building at [[Yale]], 1718–1782]]
The number of universities in Paris remained relatively constant throughout the 18th century. Europe had about 105 universities and colleges by 1700. North America had 44, including the newly founded [[Harvard]] and [[Yale]].&lt;ref&gt;Porter (2003), 44.&lt;/ref&gt; The number of university students remained roughly the same throughout the Enlightenment in most Western nations, excluding Britain, where the number of institutions and students increased.&lt;ref&gt;Porter (2003), 52.&lt;/ref&gt; University students were generally males from affluent families, seeking a career in either medicine, law, or the Church. The universities themselves existed primarily to educate future [[physician]]s, [[lawyer]]s and members of the [[clergy]].&lt;ref&gt;Porter (2003), 45.&lt;/ref&gt;

The study of science under the heading of [[natural philosophy]] was divided into physics and a conglomerate grouping of chemistry and [[natural history]], which included [[anatomy]], biology, [[geology]], [[mineralogy]], and [[zoology]].&lt;ref&gt;Porter (2003), 79-80.&lt;/ref&gt;  Most European universities taught a [[René Descartes|Cartesian]] form of [[mechanical philosophy]] in the early 18th century, and only slowly adopted Newtonianism in the mid-18th century. A notable exception were universities in [[Spain]], which under the influence of [[Catholicism]] focused almost entirely on Aristotelian natural philosophy until the mid-18th century; they were among the last universities to do so. Another exception occurred in the universities of [[Germany]] and [[Scandinavia]], where [[University of Halle]] professor [[Christian Wolff (philosopher)|Christian Wolff]] taught a form of Cartesianism modified by [[Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz|Leibniz]]ian physics.&lt;ref&gt;Burns (2003), entry: 239.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Boyle air pump.jpg|thumb|230px|right|[[Robert Boyle]]'s air-pump, used in the demonstration lectures of [[Pierre Polinière]].]]
Before the 18th century, science courses were taught almost exclusively through formal [[lecture]]s. The structure of courses began to change in the first decades of the 18th century, when [[scientific demonstration|physical demonstrations]] were added to lectures. [[Pierre Polinière]] and [[Jacques Rohault]] were among the first individuals to provide demonstrations of physical principles in the classroom. Experiments ranged from swinging a bucket of water at the end of a rope, demonstrating that [[centrifugal force]] would hold the water in the bucket, to more impressive experiments involving the use of an [[Vacuum pump|air-pump]].&lt;ref&gt;Sutton, (1995), p. 195.)&lt;/ref&gt; One particularly dramatic air-pump demonstration involved placing an apple inside the glass receiver of the air-pump, and removing air until the resulting vacuum caused the apple to explode.&lt;ref&gt;Sutton, (1995), p. 199.&lt;/ref&gt; Polinière’s demonstrations were so impressive that he was granted an invitation to present his course to [[Louis XV]] in 1722.&lt;ref&gt;Sutton, (1995), p. 195.&lt;/ref&gt;

Some attempts at reforming the structure of the science curriculum were made during the 18th century and the first decades of the 19th century. Beginning around 1745, the [[Hats (party)|Hats party]] in Sweden made propositions to reform the university system by separating natural philosophy into two separate faculties of physics and mathematics. The propositions were never put into action, but they represent the growing calls for institutional reform in the later part of the 18th century.&lt;ref&gt;Porter, (2003), p. 54.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1777, the study of arts at [[Cracow]] and [[Vilna]] in [[Poland]] was divided into the two new faculties of [[moral philosophy]] and physics. However, the reform did not survive beyond 1795 and the [[Third Partition of Poland|Third Partition]]. During the French Revolution, all colleges and universities in France were abolished and reformed in 1808 under the single institution of the ''Université imperiale''. The ''Université'' divided the arts and sciences into separate faculties, something that had never before been done before in Europe. The [[United Kingdom of the Netherlands]] employed the same system in 1815. However, the other countries of Europe did not adopt a similar division of the faculties until the mid-19th century.&lt;ref&gt;Porter, (2003), p. 55.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Entrance of Goettingen.JPG|thumb|230px|The old entrance to the [[University of Göttingen]]|right]]
Universities in France tended to serve a downplayed role in the development of science during the Enlightenment; that role was dominated by the scientific academies, such as the [[French Academy of Sciences]]. The contributions of universities in Britain were mixed. On the one hand, the [[University of Cambridge]] began teaching Newtonianism early in the Enlightenment, but failed to become a central force behind the advancement of science. On the other end of the spectrum were Scottish universities, which had strong medical faculties and became centres of scientific development.&lt;ref name="Burns, 2003, entry: 239"&gt;Burns, (2003), entry: 239.&lt;/ref&gt; Under [[Frederick II of Prussia|Frederick II]], German universities began to promote the sciences. [[Christian Wolff (philosopher)|Christian Wolff]]'s unique blend of Cartesian-Leibnizian physics began to be adopted in universities outside of Halle. The [[University of Göttingen]], founded in 1734, was far more liberal than its counterparts, allowing professors to plan their own courses and select their own textbooks. Göttingen also emphasized research and publication.&lt;ref&gt;Porter, (2003), p. 57.&lt;/ref&gt; A further influential development in German universities was the abandonment of [[Latin]] in favour of the German [[vernacular]].&lt;ref&gt;Butts, (1955), p. 29.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 17th century, the [[Netherlands]] had played a significant role in the advancement of the sciences, including [[Isaac Beeckman|Isaac Beeckman’s]] mechanical philosophy and [[Christiaan Huygens]]’ work on [[the calculus]] and in [[astronomy]].&lt;ref&gt;Jacob, (1988), pp.52-53.&lt;/ref&gt; Professors at universities in the [[Dutch Republic]] were among the first to adopt Newtonianism. From the [[University of Leiden]], [[Willem 's Gravesande]]’s students went on to spread Newtonianism to [[Harderwijk]] and [[Franeker]], among other Dutch universities, and also to the [[University of Amsterdam]].&lt;ref&gt;Jacob, (1988), pp. 182-187.&lt;/ref&gt;

While the number of universities did not dramatically increase during the Enlightenment, new private and public institutions added to the provision of education. Most of the new institutions emphasized mathematics as a discipline, making them popular with professions that required some working knowledge of mathematics, such as merchants, military and naval officers, and engineers.&lt;ref&gt;Porter, (2003), p. 73.&lt;/ref&gt; Universities, on the other hand, maintained their emphasis on the classics, Greek, and Latin, encouraging the popularity of the new institutions with individuals who had not been formally educated.&lt;ref name="Burns, 2003, entry: 239"/&gt;

==Societies and Academies==

Scientific academies and societies grew out of the Scientific Revolution as the creators of scientific knowledge in contrast to the scholasticism of the university.&lt;ref&gt;Gillispie, (1980), p. xix.&lt;/ref&gt; During the Enlightenment, some societies created or retained links to universities. However, contemporary sources distinguished universities from scientific societies by claiming that the university’s utility was in the transmission of knowledge, while societies functioned to create knowledge.&lt;ref&gt;James E. McClellan III, “Learned Societies,” in ''Encyclopedia of the Enlightenment'', ed. Alan Charles Kors (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2003) {{cite web |url=http://www.oup.com/us/catalog/general/subject/HistoryWorld/Modern/?view=usa&amp;ci=9780195104301 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2015-10-16 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120330082517/http://www.oup.com/us/catalog/general/subject/HistoryWorld/Modern/?view=usa&amp;ci=9780195104301 |archivedate=2012-03-30 |df= }} (accessed on June 8, 2008).&lt;/ref&gt; As the role of universities in institutionalized science began to diminish, learned societies became the cornerstone of organized science. After 1700 a tremendous number of official academies and societies were founded in Europe and by 1789 there were over seventy official scientific societies . In reference to this growth, [[Bernard de Fontenelle]] coined the term “the Age of Academies” to describe the 18th century.&lt;ref&gt;Porter, (2003), p. 90.&lt;/ref&gt;

National scientific societies were founded throughout the Enlightenment era in the urban hotbeds of scientific development across Europe. In the 17th century the [[Royal Society of London]] (1662), the Paris ''[[Académie Royale des Sciences]]'' (1666), and the Berlin ''[[Akademie der Wissenschaften]]'' (1700) were founded. Around the start of the 18th century, the ''[[Academia Scientiarum Imperialis]]'' (1724) in [[St. Petersburg]], and the ''[[Kungliga Vetenskapsakademien]]'' (Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences) (1739) were created. Regional and provincial societies emerged from the 18th century in [[Bologna]], [[Bordeaux]], [[Copenhagen]], [[Dijon]], [[Lyon]]s, [[Montpellier]] and [[Uppsala]]. Following this initial period of growth, societies were founded between 1752 and 1785 in [[Barcelona]], [[Brussels]], [[Dublin]], [[Edinburgh]], Göttingen, [[Mannheim]], [[Munich]], [[Padua]] and [[Turin]]. The development of unchartered societies, such as the private the ''[[Naturforschende Gesellschaft]]'' of [[Danzig]] (1743) and [[Lunar Society]] of Birmingham (1766–1791), occurred alongside the growth of national, regional and provincial societies.&lt;ref&gt;Porter, (2003), pp. 90-91.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Kunstkamera (Saint-Petersburg).jpg|thumb|250px|Original headquarters of the Imperial Academy of Sciences - the [[Kunstkammer]] in [[Saint Petersburg]].|right]]
Official scientific societies were chartered by the state in order to provide technical expertise.&lt;ref&gt;Porter, (2003), p. 91.&lt;/ref&gt; This advisory capacity offered scientific societies the most direct contact between the scientific community and government bodies available during the Enlightenment.&lt;ref&gt;Gillispie, (1980), p. xxiii.&lt;/ref&gt; State sponsorship was beneficial to the societies as it brought finance and recognition, along with a measure of freedom in management. Most societies were granted permission to oversee their own publications, control the election of new members, and the administration of the society.&lt;ref&gt;See Gillispie, (1980), “Conclusion.”&lt;/ref&gt; Membership in academies and societies was therefore highly selective. In some societies, members were required to pay an annual fee to participate. For example, the Royal Society depended on contributions from its members, which excluded a wide range of artisans and mathematicians on account of the expense.&lt;ref&gt;Daston, (1998), p. 71&lt;/ref&gt; Society activities included research, experimentation, sponsoring essay prize contests, and collaborative projects between societies. A dialogue of formal communication also developed between societies and society in general through the publication of [[scientific journal]]s. [[Periodicals]] offered society members the opportunity to publish, and for their ideas to be consumed by other scientific societies and the literate public. Scientific journals, readily accessible to members of learned societies, became the most important form of publication for scientists during the Enlightenment.&lt;ref&gt;Gillispie, (1980), p. xxi.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Periodicals==

[[File:1665 phil trans vol i title.png|thumb|210px|Cover of the first volume of ''[[Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society]],'' 1665-1666|left]]
Academies and societies served to disseminate Enlightenment science by publishing the scientific works of their members, as well as their proceedings. At the beginning of the 18th century, the ''[[Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society]]'', published by the Royal Society of London, was the only scientific periodical being published on a regular, [[quarterly]] basis. The Paris Academy of Sciences, formed in 1666, began publishing in volumes of memoirs rather than a quarterly journal, with periods between volumes sometimes lasting years. While some official periodicals may have published more frequently, there was still a long delay from a paper’s submission for review to its actual publication. Smaller periodicals, such as ''[[American Philosophical Society|Transactions of the American Philosophical Society]]'', were only published when enough content was available to complete a volume.&lt;ref name="Burns, 2003, entry: 199"&gt;Burns, (2003), entry: 199.&lt;/ref&gt; At the Paris Academy, there was an average delay of three years for publication. At one point the period extended to seven years.&lt;ref&gt;Porter, (2003), p.95.&lt;/ref&gt; The Paris Academy processed submitted articles through the ''[[Comité de Librarie]]'', which had the final word on what would or would not be published.&lt;ref&gt;McClellan, (2003), pp. 11-18&lt;/ref&gt; In 1703, the mathematician [[Antoine Parent]] began a periodical, ''Researches in Physics and Mathematics'', specifically to publish papers that had been rejected by the ''Comité''.&lt;ref name="Burns, 2003, entry: 199"/&gt;

[[File:1665 journal des scavans title.jpg|thumb|The first issue of the ''[[Journal des sçavans]]'' ]]
The limitations of such academic journals left considerable space for the rise of independent periodicals. Some eminent examples include [[Johann Ernst Immanuel Walch]]'s ''[[Der Naturforscher]]'' (The Natural Investigator) (1725–1778), ''[[Journal des sçavans]]'' (1665–1792), the [[Jesuit]] ''[[Mémoires de Trévoux]]'' (1701–1779), and Leibniz’s ''[[Acta Eruditorum]]'' (Reports/Acts of the Scholars) (1682–1782). Independent periodicals were published throughout the Enlightenment and excited scientific interest in the general public.&lt;ref&gt;Lynn, (2006), p.16&lt;/ref&gt; While the journals of the academies primarily published scientific papers, independent periodicals were a mix of reviews, abstracts, translations of foreign texts, and sometimes derivative, reprinted materials.&lt;ref name="Burns, 2003, entry: 199"/&gt; Most of these texts were published in the local vernacular, so their continental spread depended on the language of the readers.&lt;ref&gt;Porter, (2003), p. 195&lt;/ref&gt; For example, in 1761 Russian scientist [[Mikhail Lomonosov]] correctly attributed the ring of light around [[Venus]], visible during the planet’s [[Transit of Venus|transit]], as the planet's [[atmosphere]]; however, because few scientists understood Russian outside of Russia, his discovery was not widely credited until 1910.&lt;ref&gt;Schectman, (2003), p. xxxvii.&lt;/ref&gt;

Some changes in periodicals occurred during the course of the Enlightenment. First, they increased in number and size. There was also a move away from publishing in Latin in favour of publishing in the vernacular. Experimental descriptions became more detailed and began to be accompanied by reviews.&lt;ref name="Burns, 2003, entry: 199"/&gt;  In the late 18th century, a second change occurred when a new breed of periodical began to publish monthly about new developments and experiments in the scientific community. The first of this kind of journal was [[François Rozier]]'s ''Observations sur la physiques, sur l’histoire naturelle et sur les arts'', commonly referred to as "Rozier’s journal", which was first published in 1772. The journal allowed new scientific developments to be published relatively quickly compared to annuals and quarterlies. A third important change was the specialization seen in the new development of disciplinary journals. With a wider audience and ever increasing publication material, specialized journals such as Curtis’ ''[[Botanical Magazine]]'' (1787) and the ''[[Annals de Chimie]]'' (1789) reflect the growing division between scientific disciplines in the Enlightenment era.&lt;ref&gt;Porter, (2003), p.96.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Encyclopedias and dictionaries==

Although the existence of [[dictionaries]] and [[encyclopedia]] spanned into ancient times, and would be nothing new to Enlightenment readers, the texts changed from simply defining words in a long running list to far more detailed discussions of those words in 18th-century [[encyclopedic dictionary|encyclopedic dictionaries]].&lt;ref&gt;Headrick, (2000), p. 144.&lt;/ref&gt; The works were part of an Enlightenment movement to systematize knowledge and provide education to a wider audience than the educated elite. As the 18th century progressed, the content of encyclopedias also changed according to readers’ tastes. Volumes tended to focus more strongly on [[secular]] affairs, particularly science and technology, rather than matters of [[theology]].

Along with secular matters, readers also favoured an alphabetical ordering scheme over cumbersome works arranged along thematic lines.&lt;ref&gt;Headrick, (2000), p. 172.&lt;/ref&gt; The historian [[Charles Porset]], commenting on alphabetization, has said that “as the zero degree of taxonomy, alphabetical order authorizes all reading strategies; in this respect it could be considered an emblem of the Enlightenment.” For Porset, the avoidance of thematic and [[hierarchical]] systems thus allows free interpretation of the works and becomes an example of [[egalitarianism]].&lt;ref&gt;Porter, (2003), pp. 249-50.&lt;/ref&gt; Encyclopedias and dictionaries also became more popular during the Age of Reason as the number of educated consumers who could afford such texts began to multiply.&lt;ref&gt;Headrick, (2000), p. 144&lt;/ref&gt; In the later half of the 18th century, the number of dictionaries and encyclopedias published by decade increased from 63 between 1760 and 1769 to approximately 148 in the decade proceeding the French Revolution (1780–1789).&lt;ref&gt;Headrick, (2000), p. 168)&lt;/ref&gt; Along with growth in numbers, dictionaries and encyclopedias also grew in length, often having multiple print runs that sometimes included in supplemented editions.&lt;ref&gt;Headrick, (2000), p. 172&lt;/ref&gt;

The first technical dictionary was drafted by [[John Harris (writer)|John Harris]] and entitled ''[[Lexicon technicum|Lexicon Technicum: Or, An Universal English Dictionary of Arts and Sciences]]''. Harris’ book avoided theological and biographical entries; instead it concentrated on science and technology. Published in 1704, the ''Lexicon technicum'' was the first book to be written in English that took a methodical approach to describing mathematics and commercial [[arithmetic]] along with the physical sciences and [[navigation]]. Other technical dictionaries followed Harris’ model, including [[Ephraim Chambers]]’ ''[[Cyclopaedia, or an Universal Dictionary of Arts and Sciences|Cyclopaedia]]'' (1728), which included five editions, and was a substantially larger work than Harris’. The [[Book binding|folio]] edition of the work even included foldout engravings. The ''Cyclopaedia'' emphasized Newtonian theories, [[John Locke|Lockean]] philosophy, and contained thorough examinations of technologies, such as [[engraving]], [[brewing]], and [[dyeing]]. [[File:ENC SYSTEME FIGURE.jpeg|250px|thumb|left|"[[Figurative system of human knowledge]]", the structure that the Encyclopédie organised knowledge into. It had three main branches: memory, reason, and imagination]] In Germany, practical reference works intended for the uneducated majority became popular in the 18th century. The ''Marperger Curieuses Natur-, Kunst-, Berg-, Gewerkund Handlungs-Lexicon'' (1712) explained terms that usefully described the trades and scientific and commercial education. ''Jablonksi Allgemeines Lexicon'' (1721) was better known than the ''Handlungs-Lexicon'', and underscored technical subjects rather than scientific theory. For example, over five columns of text were dedicated to wine, while geometry and [[logic]] were allocated only twenty-two and seventeen lines, respectively. The first edition of the ''[[Encyclopædia Britannica]]'' (1771) was modelled along the same lines as the German lexicons.&lt;ref&gt;Headrick, (2000), pp. 150-152.&lt;/ref&gt;

However, the prime example of reference works that systematized scientific knowledge in the age of Enlightenment were [[universal encyclopedia]]s rather than technical dictionaries. It was the goal of universal encyclopedias to record all human knowledge in a comprehensive reference work.&lt;ref&gt;Headrick, (2000), p. 153.&lt;/ref&gt; The most well-known of these works is [[Denis Diderot]] and [[Jean le Rond d'Alembert]]'s ''[[Encyclopédie, ou dictionnaire raisonné des sciences, des arts et des métiers]]''. The work, which began publication in 1751, was composed of thirty-five volumes and over 71 000 separate entries. A great number of the entries were dedicated to describing the sciences and crafts in detail. In d’Alembert’s ''Preliminary Discourse to the Encyclopedia of Diderot'', the work’s massive goal to record the extent of human knowledge in the arts and sciences is outlined:

{{cquote|As an Encyclopédie, it is to set forth as well as possible the order and connection of the parts of human knowledge. As a Reasoned Dictionary of the Sciences, Arts, and Trades, it is to contain the general principles that form the basis of each science and each art, liberal or mechanical, and the most essential facts that make up the body and substance of each.}}&lt;ref&gt;d’Alembert, p. 4.&lt;/ref&gt;

The massive work was arranged according to a “tree of knowledge." The tree reflected the marked division between the arts and sciences, which was largely a result of the rise of empiricism. Both areas of knowledge were united by  philosophy, or the trunk of the tree of knowledge. The Enlightenment’s desacrilization of religion was pronounced in the tree’s design, particularly where theology accounted for a peripheral branch, with black magic as a close neighbour.&lt;ref&gt;Darnton, (1979), p. 7.&lt;/ref&gt; As the ''Encyclopédie'' gained popularity, it was published in [[book binding|quarto]] and [[book binding|octavo]] editions after 1777. The quarto and octavo editions were much less expensive than previous editions, making the ''Encyclopédie'' more accessible to the non-elite. Robert Darnton estimates that there were approximately 25 000 copies of the ''Encyclopédie'' in circulation throughout France and Europe before the French Revolution.&lt;ref&gt;Darnton, (1979), p. 37.&lt;/ref&gt; The extensive, yet affordable encyclopedia came to represent the transmission of Enlightenment and scientific education to an expanding audience.&lt;ref&gt;Darnton, (1979), p. 6.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Popularization of science==

One of the most important developments that the Enlightenment era brought to the discipline of science was its popularization. An increasingly literate population seeking knowledge and education in both the arts and the sciences drove the expansion of print culture and the dissemination of scientific learning. The new literate population was due to a high rise in the availability of food. This enabled many people to rise out of poverty, and instead of paying more for food, they had money for education.&lt;ref&gt;Jacob, (1988), p. 191; Melton, (2001), pp. 82-83&lt;/ref&gt; Popularization was generally part of an overarching Enlightenment ideal that endeavoured “to make information available to the greatest number of people.”&lt;ref&gt;Headrick, (2000), p. 15&lt;/ref&gt; As public interest in natural philosophy grew during the 18th century, public lecture courses and the publication of popular texts opened up new roads to money and fame  for amateurs and scientists who remained on the periphery of universities and academies.&lt;ref&gt;Headrick, (2000), p. 19.&lt;/ref&gt;

===British coffeehouses===

An early example of science emanating from the official institutions into the public realm was the British [[coffeehouse]]. With the establishment of coffeehouses, a new public forum for political, philosophical and scientific discourse was created. In the mid-16th century, coffeehouses cropped up around [[Oxford]], where the academic community began to capitalize on the unregulated conversation that the coffeehouse allowed.&lt;ref&gt;Cowen, (2005), p. 91.&lt;/ref&gt; The new social space began to be used by some scholars as a place to discuss science and experiments outside of the laboratory of the official institution.&lt;ref&gt;Cowen, (2005), p. 106.&lt;/ref&gt; Coffeehouse patrons were only required to purchase a dish of coffee to participate, leaving the opportunity for many, regardless of financial means, to benefit from the conversation. Education was a central theme and some patrons began offering lessons and lectures to others. The chemist [[Peter Staehl]] provided chemistry lessons at Tilliard’s coffeehouse in the early 1660s. As coffeehouses developed in [[London]], customers heard lectures on scientific subjects, such as astronomy and mathematics, for an exceedingly low price.&lt;ref&gt;Cowen, (2005), p. 99.&lt;/ref&gt;  Notable Coffeehouse enthusiasts included [[John Aubrey]], [[Robert Hooke]], [[James Brydges, 1st Duke of Chandos|James Brydges]], and [[Samuel Pepys]].&lt;ref&gt;Cowen, (2005), pp. 96-109.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Public lectures===

Public lecture courses offered some scientists who were unaffiliated with official organizations a forum to transmit scientific knowledge, at times even their own ideas, and the opportunity to carve out a reputation and, in some instances, a living. The public, on the other hand, gained both knowledge and entertainment from demonstration lectures.&lt;ref&gt;For a detailed analysis of public lectures, see Geoffrey Sutton, ''Science for a Polite Society: Gender, Culture, and the Demonstration of Enlightenment'' (Colorado: Westview Press, 1995). Margaret Jacob offers a more specific analysis of lecturers in Holland and England in ''The Cultural Meaning of the Scientific Revolution'' ( New York: Knopf, 1988).&lt;/ref&gt; Between 1735 and 1793, there were over seventy individuals offering courses and demonstrations for public viewers in experimental physics. Class sizes ranged from one hundred to four or five hundred attendees.&lt;ref&gt;Headrick, (2000), p. 19&lt;/ref&gt; Courses varied in duration from one to four weeks, to a few months, or even the entire academic year. Courses were offered at virtually any time of day; the latest occurred at 8:00 or 9:00 at night. One of the most popular start times was 6:00 pm, allowing the working population to participate and signifying the attendance of the nonelite.&lt;ref&gt;Headrick, (2000), pp. 26-27&lt;/ref&gt; Barred from the universities and other institutions, women were often in attendance at demonstration lectures and constituted a significant number of [[Academic audit|auditors]].&lt;ref&gt;Headrick, (2000), p. 18&lt;/ref&gt;

The importance of the lectures was not in teaching complex mathematics or physics, but rather in demonstrating to the wider public the principles of physics and encouraging discussion and debate. Generally, individuals presenting the lectures did not adhere to any particular brand of physics, but rather demonstrated a combination of different theories.&lt;ref&gt;Headrick, (2000), pp. 29-31&lt;/ref&gt; New advancements in the study of electricity offered viewers demonstrations that drew far more inspiration among the laity than scientific papers could hold. An example of a popular demonstration used by [[Jean-Antoine Nollet]] and other lecturers was the ‘electrified boy’. In the demonstration, a young boy would be suspended from the ceiling, horizontal to the floor, with silk chords. An electrical machine would then be used to electrify the boy. Essentially becoming a magnet, he would then attract a collection of items scattered about him by the lecturer. Sometimes a young girl would be called from the auditors to touch or kiss the boy on the cheek, causing sparks to shoot between the two children in what was dubbed the ‘electric kiss‘.&lt;ref&gt;Sutton, (1995), pp. 304-305.&lt;/ref&gt; Such marvels would certainly have entertained the audience, but the demonstration of physical principles also served an educational purpose. One 18th-century lecturer insisted on the utility of his demonstrations, stating that they were “useful for the good of society.” &lt;ref&gt;Headrick, (2000), p. 34&lt;/ref&gt;

===Popular science in print===

Increasing literacy rates in Europe during the course of the Enlightenment enabled science to enter popular culture through print. More formal works included explanations of scientific theories for individuals lacking the educational background to comprehend the original scientific text. [[Isaac Newton|Sir Isaac Newton’s]] celebrated ''[[Philosophiae Naturalis Principia Mathematica]]'' was published in Latin and remained inaccessible to readers without education in the classics until Enlightenment writers began to translate and analyze the text in the vernacular. The first French introduction to Newtonianism and the ''Principia'' was ''Eléments de la philosophie de Newton'', published by Voltaire in 1738.&lt;ref&gt;Porter, (2003), p. 300.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Émilie du Châtelet]]'s translation of the ''Principia'', published after her death in 1756, also helped to spread Newton’s theories beyond scientific academies and the university.&lt;ref&gt;Porter, (2003), p. 101.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Fontenelle.jpg|thumb|250px|left|A portrait of [[Bernard de Fontenelle]].]]
However, science took an ever greater step towards popular culture before Voltaire’s introduction and Châtelet’s translation. The publication of [[Bernard de Fontenelle]]'s ''[[Conversations on the Plurality of Worlds]]'' (1686) marked the first significant work that expressed scientific theory and knowledge expressly for the laity, in the vernacular, and with the entertainment of readers in mind. The book was produced specifically for women with an interest in scientific writing and inspired a variety of similar works.&lt;ref&gt;Phillips, (1991), pp. 85, 90&lt;/ref&gt; These popular works were written in a discursive style, which was laid out much more clearly for the reader than the complicated articles, treatises, and books published by the academies and scientists. [[Charles Leadbetter|Charles Leadbetter’s]] ''Astronomy'' (1727) was advertised as “a Work entirely New” that would include “short and easie {{sic}} Rules and Astronomical Tables.”&lt;ref&gt;Phillips, (1991), p. 90.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Francesco Algarotti]], writing for a growing female audience, published ''Il Newtonianism per le dame'', which was a tremendously popular work and was translated from Italian into English by [[Elizabeth Carter]]. A similar introduction to Newtonianism for women was produced by [[Henry Pembarton]]. His ''A View of Sir Isaac Newton’s Philosophy'' was published by subscription. Extant records of subscribers show that women from a wide range of social standings purchased the book, indicating the growing number of scientifically inclined female readers among the middling class.&lt;ref&gt;Phillips, (1991), p. 92.&lt;/ref&gt; During the Enlightenment, women also began producing popular scientific works themselves. [[Sarah Trimmer]] wrote a successful natural history textbook for children entitled ''The Easy Introduction to the Knowledge of Nature'' (1782), which was published for many years after in eleven editions.&lt;ref&gt;Phillips, (1991), p. 107.&lt;/ref&gt;

The influence of science also began appearing more commonly in poetry and literature during the Enlightenment. Some poetry became infused with [[scientific metaphor]] and imagery, while other poems were written directly about scientific topics. [[Sir Richard Blackmore]] committed the Newtonian system to verse in ''Creation, a Philosophical Poem in Seven Books'' (1712). After Newton’s death in 1727, poems were composed in his honour for decades.&lt;ref name="Burns, 2003, entry: 158"&gt;Burns, (2003), entry: 158.&lt;/ref&gt; [[James Thomson (poet)|James Thomson]] (1700–1748) penned his “Poem to the Memory of Newton,” which mourned the loss of Newton, but also praised his science and legacy:&lt;br&gt;

&lt;center&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;
Thy swift career is with whirling orbs, &lt;br&gt;
Comparing things with things in rapture loft, &lt;br&gt;
And grateful adoration, for that light, &lt;br&gt;
So plenteous ray'd into thy mind below.&lt;ref&gt;Thomson, (1786), p. 203.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

While references to the sciences were often positive, there were some Enlightenment writers who criticized scientists for what they viewed as their obsessive, frivolous careers. Other antiscience writers, including [[William Blake]], chastised scientists for attempting to use physics, mechanics and mathematics to simplify the complexities of the universe, particularly in relation to God. The character of the evil scientist was invoked during this period in the romantic tradition. For example, the characterization of the scientist as a nefarious manipulator in the work of [[Ernst Theodor Wilhelm Hoffmann]].&lt;ref name="Burns, 2003, entry: 158"/&gt;

==Women in science==

[[File:Yekaterina Romanovna Vorontsova-Dashkova.jpg|thumb|200px|right|A portrait of [[Yekaterina Romanovna Vorontsova-Dashkova]].]]
During the Enlightenment era, women were excluded from scientific societies, universities and learned professions. Women were educated, if at all, through self-study, tutors, and by the teachings of more open-minded fathers. With the exception of daughters of craftsmen, who sometimes learned their father’s profession by assisting in the workshop, learned women were primarily part of elite society.&lt;ref&gt;Kors, (2003), “Education”&lt;/ref&gt; A consequence of the exclusion of women from societies and universities that prevented much independent research was their inability to access scientific instruments, such as the microscope. In fact, restrictions were so severe in the 18th century that women, including midwives, were forbidden to use [[forceps]].&lt;ref&gt;Whitehead, (1991), p. 227.&lt;/ref&gt; That particular restriction exemplified the increasingly constrictive, male-dominated medical community. Over the course of the 18th century, male surgeons began to assume the role of midwives in gynaecology. Some male satirists also ridiculed scientifically minded women, describing them as neglectful of their domestic role.&lt;ref name="Burns, 2003, entry: 253"&gt;Burns, (2003), entry: 253.&lt;/ref&gt; The negative view of women in the sciences reflected the  sentiment apparent in some Enlightenment texts that women need not, nor ought to be educated; the opinion is  exemplified by Jean-Jacques Rousseau in ''Émile'':

{{cquote|A woman’s education must... be planned in relation to man. To be pleasing in his sight, to win his respect and love, to train him in childhood, to tend him in manhood, to counsel and console, to make his life pleasant and happy, these are the duties of woman for all time, and this is what she should be taught while she is young.}}&lt;ref&gt;Kors, (2003), “Education.”&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:David - Portrait of Monsieur Lavoisier and His Wife.jpg|thumb|250px|left|''Portrait of M. and Mme Lavoisier'', by [[Jacques-Louis David]], 1788 (Metropolitan Museum)]]
Despite these limitations, there was support for women in the sciences among some men, and many made valuable contributions to science during the 18th century. Two notable women who managed to participate in formal institutions were [[Laura Bassi]] and the Russian Princess [[Yekaterina Romanovna Vorontsova-Dashkova|Yekaterina Dashkova]]. Bassi was an Italian physicist who received a PhD from the University of Bologna and began teaching there in 1732. Dashkova became the director of the Russian Imperial Academy of Sciences of St. Petersburg in 1783. Her personal relationship with Empress [[Catherine the Great]] (r. 1762-1796) allowed her to obtain the position, which marked in history the first appointment of a woman to the directorship of a scientific academy.&lt;ref name="Burns, 2003, entry: 253"/&gt;

More commonly, women participated in the sciences through an association with a male relative or spouse. [[Caroline Herschel]] began her astronomical career, although somewhat reluctantly at first, by assisting her brother [[William Herschel]]. Caroline Herschel is most remembered for her discovery of eight comets and her ''Index to Flamsteed’s Observations of the Fixed Stars'' (1798). On August 1, 1786, Herschel discovered her first comet, much to the excitement of scientifically minded women. [[Fanny Burney]] commented on the discovery, stating that “the comet was very small, and had nothing grand or striking in its appearance; but it is the first lady’s comet, and I was very desirous to see it.”&lt;ref&gt;Phillips, (1991), p. 161.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Marie-Anne Pierette Paulze]] worked collaboratively with her husband, [[Antoine Lavoisier]]. Aside from assisting in Lavoisier’s laboratory research, she was responsible for translating a number of English texts into French for her husband’s work on the new chemistry. Paulze also illustrated many of her husband’s publications, such as his ''Treatise on Chemistry'' (1789). [[Eva Ekeblad]] became the first woman inducted into the [[Royal Swedish Academy of Science]] (1748).

Many other women became illustrators or translators of scientific texts. In France, [[Françoise Basseporte|Madeleine Françoise Basseporte]] was employed by the Royal Botanical Garden as an illustrator. Englishwoman [[Mary Delany]] developed a unique method of illustration. Her technique involved using hundreds of pieces of coloured-paper to recreate lifelike renditions of living plants. German born [[Maria Sibylla Merian]] along with her daughters including [[Dorothea Maria Graff]] were involved in the careful scientific study of insects and the natural world. Using mostly watercolor, gauche on vellum, She became one of the leading entomologist of the 18th century. They were also one of the first female entomologists who took a scientific trip to Suriname to study plant life for a total of a five year span.

Noblewomen sometimes cultivated their own botanical gardens, including [[Mary Somerset, Duchess of Beaufort (1630–1715)|Mary Somerset]] and [[Margaret Harley]]. Scientific translation sometimes required more than a grasp on multiple languages. Besides translating Newton’s ''Principia'' into French, [[Émilie du Châtelet]] expanded Newton’s work to include recent progress made in mathematical physics after his death.&lt;ref name="Burns, 2003, entry: 253" /&gt;

==Disciplines==

===Astronomy===
{{Main|History of Astronomy}}

Building on the body of work forwarded by [[Copernicus]], [[Kepler]] and [[Isaac Newton|Newton]], 18th-century astronomers refined [[telescopes]], produced [[star catalogue]]s, and worked towards explaining the motions of heavenly bodies and the consequences of [[universal gravitation]].&lt;ref&gt;Porter, (2003), p. 328.&lt;/ref&gt; Among the prominent astronomers of the age was [[Edmund Halley]]. In 1705, Halley correctly linked historical descriptions of particularly bright comets to the reappearance of just one, which would later be named [[Halley’s Comet]], based on his computation of the orbits of comets.&lt;ref&gt;Turner, (1963), p. 88.&lt;/ref&gt; Halley also changed the theory of the Newtonian universe, which described the fixed stars. When he compared the ancient positions of stars to their contemporary positions, he found that they had shifted.&lt;ref&gt;Hoskin, (1999), p. 174.&lt;/ref&gt; [[James Bradley]], while attempting to document [[stellar parallax]], realized that the unexplained motion of stars he had early observed with [[Samuel Molyneux]] was caused by the [[aberration of light]]. The discovery was proof of a [[heliocentric]] model of the universe, since it is the revolution of the earth around the sun that causes an apparent motion in the observed position of a star. The discovery also led Bradley to a fairly close estimate to the speed of light.&lt;ref&gt;Mason, (1962), p. 297.&lt;/ref&gt;[[File:Herschel 40 foot.jpg|right|200px|thumb|[[William Herschel]]'s 40 foot (12 m) telescope.]]

Observations of Venus in the 18th century became an important step in describing atmospheres. During the 1761 [[transit of Venus]], the Russian scientist [[Mikhail Lomonosov]] observed a ring of light around the planet. Lomonosov attributed the ring to the refraction of sunlight, which he correctly hypothesized was caused by the atmosphere of Venus. Further evidence of Venus' atmosphere was gathered in observations by [[Johann Hieronymus Schröter]] in 1779.&lt;ref&gt;Schectman, (2003), pp. xxxvii, xl.&lt;/ref&gt;  The planet also offered [[Alexis Claude de Clairaut]] an opportunity to work his considerable mathematical skills when he computed the mass of Venus through complex mathematical calculations.&lt;ref&gt;Schectman, (2003), p. xxxvi.&lt;/ref&gt;

However, much astronomical work of the period becomes shadowed by one of the most dramatic scientific discoveries of the 18th century. On 13 March 1781, amateur astronomer [[William Herschel]] spotted a new planet with his powerful [[reflecting telescope]]. Initially identified as a comet, the celestial body later came to be accepted as a planet.&lt;ref&gt;Schectman, (2003), p. xlii.&lt;/ref&gt; Soon after, the planet was named ''Georgium Sidus'' by Herschel and was called Herschelium in France. The name [[Uranus]], as proposed by [[Johann Bode]], came into widespread usage after Herschel's death.&lt;ref&gt;Littmann, (2004), p. 11.&lt;/ref&gt; On the theoretical side of astronomy, the English natural philosopher [[John Michell]] first proposed the existence of [[dark star (Newtonian mechanics)|dark star]]s in 1783. Michell postulated that if the density of a stellar object became great enough, its attractive force would become so large that even light could not escape.&lt;ref&gt;Parker, (1991), p. 4.&lt;/ref&gt; He also surmised that the location of a dark star could be determined by the strong [[gravitational force]] it would exert on surrounding stars. While differing somewhat from a [[black hole]], the dark star can be understood as a predecessor to the black holes resulting from [[Albert Einstein|Albert Einstein's]] [[general theory of relativity]].&lt;ref&gt;Silver, (1998), p. 460.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Chemistry===
{{Main|History of Chemistry}}

The [[chemical revolution]] was a period in the 18th century marked by significant advancements in the theory and practice of chemistry. Despite the maturity of most of the sciences during the scientific revolution, by the mid-18th century chemistry had yet to outline a systematic framework or theoretical doctrine. Elements of alchemy still permeated the study of chemistry, and the belief that the natural world was composed of the [[classical elements]] of earth, water, air and fire remained prevalent.&lt;ref&gt;Olby, (1990), p. 265.&lt;/ref&gt; The key achievement of the chemical revolution has traditionally been viewed as the abandonment of [[phlogiston theory]] in favour of [[Antoine Lavoisier]]'s oxygen theory of [[combustion]];&lt;ref&gt;See H. Butterfield,  "Chapter 11" of ''The Origins of Modern Science: 1300-1800'' (New York: Macmillan, 1957) for this traditional view.&lt;/ref&gt; however, more recent studies attribute a wider range of factors as contributing forces behind the chemical revolution.&lt;ref&gt;Perrin, (1988), pp. 32-81.&lt;/ref&gt;

Developed under [[Johann Joachim Becher]] and [[Georg Ernst Stahl]], phlogiston theory was an attempt to account for products of combustion.&lt;ref name="Idhe, 1964, p. 61"&gt;Idhe, (1964), p. 61&lt;/ref&gt; According to the theory, a substance called [[phlogiston]] was released from [[Combustibility and flammability|flammable]] materials through burning. The resulting product was termed ''calx'', which was considered a 'dephlogisticated' substance in its 'true' form.&lt;ref&gt;Conant, (1950), p. 14.&lt;/ref&gt; The first strong evidence against phlogiston theory came from pneumatic chemists in Britain during the later half of the 18th century. [[Joseph Black]], [[Joseph Priestley]] and [[Henry Cavendish]] all identified different gases that composed air; however, it was not until Antoine Lavoisier discovered in the fall of 1772 that, when burned, [[sulphur]] and [[phosphorus]] “gain[ed] in weight”&lt;ref name="Idhe, 1964, p. 61"/&gt; that the phlogiston theory began to unravel.

Lavoisier subsequently discovered and named [[oxygen]], described its role in animal [[respiration (physiology)|respiration]]&lt;ref&gt;Idhe, (1964), pp. 68-69&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[calcination]] of metals exposed to air (1774–1778). In 1783, Lavoisier found that water was a compound of oxygen and [[hydrogen]].&lt;ref&gt;Conant, (1950), p. 12.&lt;/ref&gt; Lavoisier’s years of experimentation formed a body of work that contested phlogiston theory. After reading his “Reflections on Phlogiston” to the Academy in 1785, chemists began dividing into camps based on the old phlogiston theory and the new oxygen theory.&lt;ref&gt;Olby, (1990), p. 273.&lt;/ref&gt; A new form of [[chemical nomenclature]], developed by [[Louis Bernard Guyton de Morveau]], with assistance from Lavoisier, classified elements [[binomially]] into a [[genus]] and a [[species]]. For example, burned lead was of the genus [[oxide]] and species [[lead]].&lt;ref&gt;Olby, (1990), p. 264.&lt;/ref&gt; Transition to and acceptance of Lavoisier’s new chemistry varied in pace across Europe. The new chemistry was established in Glasgow and Edinburgh early in the 1790s, but was slow to become established in Germany.&lt;ref&gt;Olby, (1990), pp. 274-5.&lt;/ref&gt; Eventually the oxygen-based theory of combustion drowned out the phlogiston theory and in the process created the basis of modern chemistry.&lt;ref&gt;McClellan, (2006) p. 301&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Statue of Karadjordje in Belgrade.jpg|thumb|Monument to [[Karađorđe]] in [[Belgrade]]. Karađorđe led the [[Serbian Revolution]] that sought to liberate Serbia from the rule of the Ottoman Empire.]]

'''Serbian nationalism''' asserts that [[Serbs]] are a [[nation]] and promotes the cultural unity of Serbs.{{sfn|Motyl|2001|pp=470}} It is an [[ethnic nationalism]],{{sfn|Motyl|2001|pp=470}} originally arising in the context of the general [[rise of nationalism in the Balkans]] under [[History of Ottoman Serbia|Ottoman rule]], under the influence of Serbian linguist [[Vuk Stefanović Karadžić]] and [[Ilija Garašanin]].{{sfn|Motyl|2001|pp=470}}
Serbian nationalism was an important factor during the [[Balkan Wars]] which contributed to the decline of the [[Ottoman Empire]], during [[World War I]], the [[Austro-Hungarian Empire]] after World War I and again during the [[breakup of Yugoslavia]] and the [[Yugoslav Wars]] of the 1990s.{{sfn|Motyl|2001|pp=470–472}}

After 1878, Serbian nationalists merged their goals with those of [[Yugoslavism|Yugoslavists]], and emulated the [[Kingdom of Sardinia|Piedmont]]'s leading role in the ''[[Risorgimento]]'' of Italy, by claiming that [[Serbia]] sought not only to unite all Serbs in one state, but that Serbia intended to be a [[South Slavs|South Slavic]] Piedmont that would unite all South Slavs in one state known as [[Yugoslavia]].{{sfn|Motyl|2001|pp=470}} Serbian nationalists supported a centralized Yugoslav state that guaranteed the unity of the Serbs while resisting efforts to decentralize the state.{{sfn|Motyl|2001|pp=470}} The [[Vidovdan Constitution]] adopted by Yugoslavia in 1920, consolidated the country as a centralized state under the Serbian [[Karađorđević dynasty|Karađorđević]] monarchy.{{sfn|Motyl|2001|pp=471}} [[Croatian nationalism|Croatian nationalists]] opposed the centralized state and demanded decentralization and demanded an autonomous Croatia within Yugoslavia, that was accepted by the Yugoslav government in the [[Cvetković–Maček Agreement]] of 1939.{{sfn|Motyl|2001|pp=105}} Serbian nationalists opposed the agreement on the grounds that it weakened the unity of [[wikt:Serbdom|Serbdom]], asserting its importance to Yugoslavia with the slogan "Strong Serbdom, Strong Yugoslavia".{{sfn|Motyl|2001|pp=471}} The invasion and partition of Yugoslavia in [[World War II]], resulted in violent [[ethnic conflict]] between nationalist Serbs, [[Croats]], [[Bosniaks]], and others, resulting in a highly violent [[Sectarianism|sectarian]] variant of Serbian nationalism rising in the [[Chetnik]] movement.{{sfn|Motyl|2001|pp=471}}

The decentralization of the [[Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia]] in the 1960s and the suppression of all ethnic nationalist sentiments led to a Serbian nationalist backlash and resurgence in the 1980s, that condemned post-[[World War II]] Yugoslavism and the decentralization of Yugoslavia.{{sfn|Motyl|2001|pp=471}}{{sfn|Motyl|2001|pp=471}} Upon Yugoslavia collapsing in the 1990s with multiple republics seeking secession, Serbian nationalists demanded that all Serbs in all the Yugoslav republics had the right to be united in a common state, ethnic conflict occurred between Serbs seeking unity with Serbia and other Yugoslav [[ethnicities]] seeking independence.{{sfn|Motyl|2001|pp=472}}

The origins of Serbian nationalism date back to the 19th century beginning with the 1804 uprisings by Serbs against Ottoman rule that eventually led to the creation of an independent Serbian state in 1878.{{sfn|Motyl|2001|pp=470–472}} However Serbian nationalists themselves cite the origins of the movement as being the [[Battle of Kosovo]] on Serbian national and religious holiday [[Vidovdan]]
([[Saint Vitus Day]]) in 1389 between Serbia and the Ottoman Empire, the battle that holds important symbolic meaning to Serbian nationalists.{{sfn|Motyl|2001|pp=470}}  The Serbian linguist [[Vuk Stefanović Karadžić]] is commonly considered the father of Serbian nationalism.{{sfn|Motyl|2001|pp=470}} Karadžić created a linguistic definition of the Serbs that included all speakers of the [[Štokavian dialect]] regardless of their religious affiliation or geographical origin.{{sfn|Motyl|2001|pp=470}} However Karadžić acknowledged the right of some Štokavian-speaking peoples to call themselves names other than Serbs.{{sfn|Motyl|2001|pp=470}} [[Ilija Garašanin]] was another early proponent of Serbian nationalism and a proponent of a [[Greater Serbia]] - a Serbian state whose borders were extended to include all Serbs in the Balkan region.{{sfn|Motyl|2001|pp=470}}
[[File:Battle of Kosovo, Adam Stefanović, 1870.jpg|thumb|300px|left|''Battle of Kosovo'' (1870), painting by [[Adam Stefanović]], a depiction of the [[Battle of Kosovo]] of 1389.]]
After Serbia was recognized as an independent state in 1878, both [[South Slavs]] and the Serbian government considered their peoples in [[House of Habsburg|Habsburg]]-ruled [[Austria-Hungary]] to be under occupation resulting in increasing antagonism between Serbia and Austria-Hungary from the late 19th century to the early 20th century.{{sfn|Motyl|2001|pp=470}}

=== World War I ===
{{further|Serbian Campaign of World War I|Young Bosnia}}
In 1914 Austrian [[Archduke Franz Ferdinand of Austria|Archduke Franz Ferdinand]] was assassinated by [[Bosnian Serb]] revolutionary [[Gavrilo Princip]] resulting in Austria-Hungary accusing Serbia of involvement and subsequently declaring war on Serbia, resulting in a clash of alliances and the eruption of [[World War I]].{{sfn|Motyl|2001|pp=471}} In spite of heavy casualties, Serbia benefited from its allies' eventual victory against Germany and Austria-Hungary, with Serbia subsequently joining with territories claimed by [[Yugoslavism|Yugoslav nationalists]] to form the [[Kingdom of Yugoslavia|Kingdom of Serbs, Croats, and Slovenes]], informally known as [[Yugoslavia]], in 1918.{{sfn|Motyl|2001|pp=471}} Serbian nationalists associated with a [[Centralization|centralist]] vision of Yugoslavia as opposed to a confederal or federal state as advocated by non-Serbs.{{sfn|Motyl|2001|pp=471}} The antagonism between a centralized Yugoslavia supported by Serbian nationalists and a decentralized Yugoslavia supported by [[Croatian nationalism|Croatian]] and [[Slovenian nationalism|Slovenian nationalists]] was the main cause of unstable governance in Yugoslavia during the [[interwar period]].{{sfn|Motyl|2001|pp=471}}

===Yugoslavia===
{{further|Yugoslavia|Yugoslavism|Creation of Yugoslavia|World War 2 in Yugoslavia|Chetniks}}
In 1920, the centralized vision of Yugoslavia as supported by Serbian nationalists was enacted in the Constitution of the Kingdom of Serbs, Croats, and Slovenes passed on Serbian national and religious holiday [[Vidovdan]] ([[Saint Vitus]] Day) that became known as the "[[Vidovdan Constitution]]" or "St. Vitus Day Constitution" (Видовдански устав / ''Vidovdanski ustav'').{{sfn|Motyl|2001|pp=471}} Antagonism which rose between Serbian nationalists versus Croatian and Slovenian nationalists culminated in the 1928 [[assassination of Stjepan Radić]] on the floor of the Yugoslav parliament and the subsequent deterioration of parliamentary democracy in the country.{{sfn|Motyl|2001|pp=471}} In the aftermath [[Alexander I of Yugoslavia|King Alexander]] discarded the St. Vitus Day Constitution, proclaimed a royal dictatorship, and officially renamed the country Kingdom of Yugoslavia.{{sfn|Motyl|2001|pp=471}} King Alexander pursued a policy of encouraging modern Yugoslav nationalism which caused dissatisfaction amongst Serbian nationalists who saw Yugoslav nationalism as a disavowal of Serbian nationalism.{{sfn|Motyl|2001|pp=471}} Serbian nationalists were outraged at the [[Cvetković–Maček Agreement]] between Serb and Croat political leaders that created the [[Banovina of Croatia]], an autonomous province within the kingdom which gave Croatia virtual autonomy.{{sfn|Motyl|2001|pp=471}} In response, Serbian nationalists founded the [[Serb Cultural Club]] which attacked the new Yugoslav nationalism under the motto of "Strong Serbdom, Strong Yugoslavia".{{sfn|Motyl|2001|pp=471}}

[[File:Draza Mihailovic,1943.jpg|thumb|right|[[Draža Mihailović]], Yugoslav Serb general]]

Yugoslavia was invaded and occupied by the [[Axis Powers]] during [[World War II]], with [[Nazi Germany]] establishing puppet states throughout occupied Yugoslavia.{{sfn|Motyl|2001|pp=471}} Serbian nationalism rose in a militant response by the [[Chetnik]] forces of [[Draža Mihailović]] against both the Axis forces and the communist [[Yugoslav Partisans]].{{sfn|Motyl|2001|pp=471}} The war saw the rise of an extreme anti-Muslim variant of Serbian nationalism practised by the Chetniks who massacred [[Bosniaks|Bosnian Muslims]] during the war.{{sfn|Motyl|2001|pp=471}}

In the aftermath of World War II and the seizure of power by the Yugoslav Partisans, [[Josip Broz Tito]]'s [[Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia|communist Yugoslavia]] was established. The new regime repressed nationalism of any culture that was deemed to be a threat to the state.{{sfn|Motyl|2001|pp=471}} Serbian nationalism then developed during the 1960s by intellectuals such as [[Dobrica Ćosić]] and challenged the state-sponsored policies of [[Yugoslavism]] and "[[Brotherhood and Unity]]".{{sfn|Motyl|2001|pp=471}} Tito's later expulsion of the nationalist-leaning Serbian communist official [[Aleksandar Ranković]] in the 1960s was perceived as an attack on Serbian nationalism.{{sfn|Motyl|2001|pp=471}} After the ousting of Ranković, Serbian nationalist intellectuals increasingly began viewing Yugoslavia as a detrimental experience for the Serb nation.{{sfn|Motyl|2001|pp=471}}

Serbian nationalism escalated following the death of Tito in 1980.&lt;ref name="Ramet, Sabrina P. 2006. Pp. 322"&gt;Ramet 2006, 322.&lt;/ref&gt; Serbian intellectuals began breaking a number of taboos—for example, [[Branko Petranović]] identified Mihailović, the [[Chetnik]] rival of Tito during World War II as being an important "[[Anti-fascism|anti-fascist]]".&lt;ref name="Ramet, Sabrina P. 2006. Pp. 322"/&gt; Dobrica Ćosić joined other Serb political writers in writing the highly controversial [[Memorandum of the Serbian Academy of Sciences and Arts]] of 1986.{{sfn|Wachtel|2006|pp=86}} The Memorandum claimed to promote solutions to restore Yugoslav unity, but it focused on fiercely condemning Titoist Yugoslavia of having economically subjugated Serbia to Croatia and Slovenia and accused ethnic Albanians of committing [[genocide]] against Serbs in Kosovo.{{sfn|Wachtel|2006|pp=85&amp;ndash;87}} The Memorandum was harshly condemned by the ruling [[League of Communists of Yugoslavia]] as well as the government of Serbia led by [[Ivan Stambolić]].{{sfn|Ramet|2006|pp=321}} Members who would later support Serbian nationalism chose follow the party line and denounced the Memorandum as well. [[Slobodan Milošević]], at the time a Serbian communist official, did not speak publicly about the issue, but in a meeting with members of the secret police he formally endorsed the official government denouncement of the Memorandum, stating:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
The appearance of the Memorandum of the Serbian Academy of Arts and Sciences represents nothing else but the darkest nationalism. It means the liquidation of the current socialist system of our country, that is the disintegration after which there is no survival for any nation or nationality. ... Tito's policy of [[brotherhood and unity]] ... is the only basis on which Yugoslavia’s survival can be secured.{{sfn|Ramet|2006|pp=321}}
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Breakup of Yugoslavia and Yugoslav Wars===
{{further|Breakup of Yugoslavia|Yugoslav Wars}}
However, amidst the rising nationalist sentiment in Serbia in 1987, Milošević became their major spokesperson in the communist establishment.{{sfn|Ramet|2006|pp=337}} Milošević supported the premises of the Memorandum that included promoting centralization of power in the federal Yugoslav government to decrease the powers of the republics and autonomous provinces and a nationalist motto of "strong Serbia, strong Yugoslavia".{{sfn|Ramet|2006|pp=337}} During the [[Anti-Bureaucratic Revolution]], Milošević urged Serbians and Montenegrins to "take to the streets" and utilized the slogan "Strong Serbia, Strong Yugoslavia" that drew support from Serbs but alienated Bosnian Muslims, Croats, Kosovo Albanians, Macedonians, and Slovenes.{{sfn|Ramet|2006|pp=119}} To these groups, Milošević's agenda reminded them of the Serb hegemonic political affairs of the [[Kingdom of Yugoslavia]] and Ranković's policies.{{sfn|Ramet|2006|pp=119}}

Milošević and his supporters appealed to nationalist and populist passion by speaking of Serbia's importance to the world and using aggressive and violent political rhetoric, in a Belgrade speech on 19 November 1988, he spoke of Serbia as facing battles against both internal and external enemies.{{sfn|Ramet|2006|pp=119}} In Vojvodina, pro-Milošević demonstrators that included 500 Kosovo Serbs and local Serbs demonstrated at the provincial capital, accusing the leadership in Vojvodina of supporting separatism and for being "traitors".{{sfn|Ramet|2006|pp=350}} In August 1988, meetings by supporters of the Anti-Bureaucratic Revolution were held in many locations in Serbia and Montenegro, with increasingly violent nature, with calls being heard such as "Give us arms!", "We want weapons!", "Long live Serbia—death to Albanians!", and "Montenegro is Serbia!".{{sfn|Ramet|2006|pp=351}} In the same month, Milošević began efforts designed to destabilize the governments in Montenegro and Bosnia-Herzegovina to allow him to install his followers in those republics.{{sfn|Ramet|2006|pp=351}} By 1989, Milošević and his supporters controlled Central Serbia along with the autonomous provinces of Kosovo and Vojvodina, supporters in the leadership of Montenegro, and agents of the Serbian security service were pursuing efforts to destabilize the government in Bosnia &amp; Herzegovina.{{sfn|Ramet|2006|pp=354}} In 1989, Serbian media began to speak of "the alleged imperilment of the Serbs of Bosnia and Herzegovina", as tensions between Serbs and Bosnian Muslims and Croats increased over Serbs' support for Milošević.{{sfn|Ramet|2006|pp=355}} Efforts to spread the cult of personality of Milošević into the republic of Macedonia began in 1989 with slogans, graffiti, and songs glorifying Milošević spreading in the republic.{{sfn|Ramet|2006|pp=355}} Furthermore, Milošević proposed a law to restore land titles held by Serbs in the interwar period that effectively provided a legal basis for large numbers of Serbs to move to Kosovo and Macedonia to regain those lands while displacing the Albanian residents there.{{sfn|Ramet|2006|pp=355}} Beginning in 1989, Milošević had given support to Croatian Serbs who were vouching for the creation of an autonomous province for Croatia's Serbs that was opposed by Croatia's communist authorities.{{sfn|Ramet|2006|pp=361}} In the late 1980s Milošević allowed the mobilization of Serb nationalist organizations to go unhindered by actions from the Serbian government, with Chetniks holding demonstrations, and the Serbian government embraced the [[Serbian Orthodox Church]] and restored its legitimacy in Serbia.{{sfn|Ramet|2006|pp=349}}

Milošević and the Serbian government supported a tricameral legislature, that would include a Chamber of Citizens to represent the population of Yugoslavia, a system that would give Serbs a majority; a Chamber of Provinces and Republics to represent regional affairs; and a Chamber of Associated Labour.{{sfn|Ramet|2006|pp=338}} Serbia's specific endorsement of a Chamber of Citizens and a Chamber of Associated Labour faced opposition from the republics of Croatia and Slovenia as they saw the proposals as increasing Serbia's power and federal state control over the economy, which was the opposite of their intention to decrease federal state control over the economy.{{sfn|Ramet|2006|pp=338}} Slovenia staunchly opposed the Milošević government's plans and promoted its own reforms that would make Yugoslavia a decentralized [[confederation]].{{sfn|Ramet|2006|pp=339}}

Croatia and Slovenia denounced the actions by Milošević and began to demand that Yugoslavia be made a full multi-party confederal state.{{sfn|Ramet|2006|pp=355}} Milošević claimed that he opposed a confederal system but also declared that should a confederal system be created, the external borders of Serbia would be an "open question", insinuating that his government would pursue creating an enlarged Serbian federal republic if Yugoslavia was decentralized.{{sfn|Ramet|2006|pp=359}} In 1989, the autonomy of [[SAP Kosovo]] and [[SAP Vojvodina]] were ''[[de facto]]'' abolished by constitutional reforms that transferred powers away from the provinces to the Serbian government.

Milošević rejected the independence of Croatia in 1991, and even after the formation of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia (FRY), it too did not initially recognize Croatia's independence.{{sfn|Sriram|Martin-Ortega|Herman|2010|p=70}} Plans by Milošević to carve out territory from Croatia to the local Serbs had begun by June 1990, according to the diary of Serbian official [[Borisav Jović]].{{sfn|LeBor|2004|pp=140}} The Serbian government along with a clique of pro-Milošević members of the Yugoslav army and its general staff, secretly adopted the RAM or "frame" plan that involved the partition of Croatia and Bosnia to give large amounts of territory to the local Serbs that would remain united with Serbia, effectively a Greater Serbia.{{sfn|LeBor|2004|pp=140–143}} Armaments and military equipment were placed in strategic positions throughout Croatia and Bosnia for use by the Serbs, and local Serbs were trained as police and paramilitary soldiers in preparation for war.{{sfn|LeBor|2004|pp=140}}

Interviews with government officials involved in political affairs between Serbia and the Republic of Macedonia have revealed that Milošević planned to arrest the Republic of Macedonia's political leadership and replace it with politicians loyal to Serbia, when the Republic of Macedonia was still part of Yugoslavia.{{sfn|Ackermann|2000|p=72}} Upon the [[Republic of Macedonia]] seceding in 1991, the Serbian government declared that Macedonia was an "artificial nation" and Serbia allied with Greece against the Republic of Macedonia, even suggesting a partition of the Republic of Macedonia between Serbia and Greece.{{sfn|Ackermann|2000|p=72}} Milošević demanded the self-determination of Serbs in the Republic of Macedonia and did not recognize the independence of the Republic of Macedonia until 1996.{{sfn|Ackermann|2000|p=72}}

==Mottos==
{{see also|List of Serbian mottos}}
*"Само слога Србина спасава / Samo sloga Srbina spasava" ("[[Only Unity Saves the Serbs]]"), read into the "four C's" (as the letter 'S' is seen as a 'C' in the Serbian Cyrillic alphabet) in the [[Serbian cross]] depicted on the  [[Flag of Serbia|flag]] and [[Coat of arms of Serbia|coat of arms]] of [[Serbia]]. 
*"[[Kosovo je Srbija|Косово је Србија / Kosovo je Srbija]]" ("Kosovo is Serbia"), reaction to Kosovo's disputed independence from Serbia.
*"[[Srbija do Tokija|Србија до Токија / Srbija do Tokija]]" ("Serbia to Tokyo"), in origin a slogan of Serbian soccer fans.
*"Бог чува Србе / Bog čuva Srbe" ("God saves Serbs"), expression of Serbian faith and trust in God.
*"Нема крста без три прста / Nema krsta bez tri prsta" ("There's no cross without three fingers"), an explanation of the Serbian [[Three-finger salute (Serbian)|Three-finger Salute]] and expressing Serbian Orthodoxy. 

The [[Battle of Kosovo]] on [[Vidovdan]] ([[Saint Vitus Day]]) in 1389 between Serbia and the Ottoman Empire holds important symbolism in Serbian nationalism.{{sfn|Motyl|2001|pp=470}}

Symbols used to express Serbian ethnic nationalism include the [[Serbian cross]], a number of [[Serbian mottos|mottos or slogans]] and the so-called [[Three-finger salute (Serbian)|three-finger salute]].

'''''The Farfarers: Before the Norse''''' is a non-fiction book by [[Farley Mowat]], setting out a theory about [[pre-Columbian trans-oceanic contact]]. Mowat's thesis is that even before the [[Vikings]], North America was discovered and settled by [[European ethnic groups|Europeans]] originating from [[Orkney]] who reached Canada after a generation-spanning migration that used [[Iceland]] and [[Greenland]] as 'stepping stones'. Mowat's ideas are controversial and have been accused of being over-speculative. The book has been published in the UK as ''The Alban Quest''.

==The 'Albans'==
Mowat's premise is that Iceland, Greenland and North America were visited and settled before the Vikings by Europeans from the northern British Isles. Mowat refers to these people as ''Albans'', after the ancestral name for the British Isles, and believes that the Albans are descendants of the original [[Neolithic]] peoples of Britain and who were displaced by the [[Celts]].&lt;ref name="Mowat"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Mowat|first1=Farley|title=The Farfarers: Before the Norse|date=1998|publisher=Key Porter Books}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|p.61–74}} He argues that these peoples were later pushed to the fringes of north-western Europe, in Northern [[Scotland]], [[Orkney]] and [[Shetland]] by [[Armorica]]n refugees fleeing the [[Romans]],&lt;ref name=Mowat/&gt;{{rp|p.75–87}} who constructed [[broch]]s along the coasts of Scotland and eventually became known as the [[Picts]].&lt;ref name=Mowat/&gt;{{rp|p.88–110}}

Mowat believes that the Albans were hunters of [[walrus ivory]]&lt;ref name=Mowat/&gt;{{rp|p.30–47}} and it was the demand for this valuable material,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book  | last = Walker  | first = John Frederick  | title = Ivory's Ghosts: The White Gold of History and the Fate of Elephants  | publisher = Grove Press  | year = 2010  |pages= 55–57  | isbn = 978-0-8021-4452-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; that lead the Albans to discover [[Iceland]] or [[Thule]] centuries before the Vikings (As described by the Greek explorer [[Pytheas]] in 330 BC.)&lt;ref name=Mowat/&gt;{{rp|p.48–60}} The Albans used sophisticated long-distance boats with hulls made of [[Hide (skin)|hide]].&lt;ref name=Mowat/&gt;{{rp|p.19–29}}

==Iceland==

Mowat believes that settlement of Iceland began early in the first millennium AD.&lt;ref name=Mowat/&gt;{{rp|p.159–170}} After the [[end of Roman rule in Britain]], unrest and military threats to Alba from the [[Scoti]] in the west and the [[Vikings]] in the north resulted in widespread settlement of Iceland during the 5th to 7th centuries by fleeing Albans.&lt;ref name=Mowat/&gt;{{rp|p.120–156}}

In their search for new sources of ivory, Alban hunters explored and hunted along the coasts of Greenland,&lt;ref name=Mowat/&gt;{{rp|p.171}} [[Baffin Island]],&lt;ref name=Mowat/&gt;{{rp|p.210–221}} [[Ungava Bay]],&lt;ref name=Mowat/&gt;{{rp|p.264–282}} and [[Labrador]]&lt;ref name=Mowat/&gt;{{rp|p.283–292}} before discovering Newfoundland.&lt;ref name=Mowat/&gt;{{rp|p.295–308}} [[File:Pamiok Island historic site.jpg|thumb|right|Pamiok Island (near [[Kangirsuk]]), Longhouse No. 2]] Mowat believes that the hunters would create camp sites for overwintering by placing their skin boats on top of stone foundations, such as the one on Pamiok Island. Mowat believes that the Albans encountered the [[Tunit]] in the Canadian Arctic, with some Albans eventually living and intermarrying with the Tunit.&lt;ref name=Mowat/&gt;{{rp|p.199–209}}

Mowat believes that Viking interest in Iceland was prompted by the wealth of Ivory and other materials such as furs reaching Europe by Alban ships from Iceland. In support of this, he cites the Viking [[Sagas]], which state that the Viking discoverers of Iceland found it to be already inhabited by a people the Vikings called the [[Papar]], and that Viking explorers like [[Naddodd]],&lt;ref name=Mowat/&gt;{{rp|p.225–229}} [[Hrafna-Flóki Vilgerðarson]],&lt;ref name=Mowat/&gt;{{rp|p.232–236}} [[Garðar Svavarsson]]&lt;ref name=Mowat/&gt;{{rp|p.229–232}} and [[Ingólfr Arnarson]]&lt;ref name=Mowat/&gt;{{rp|p.237–250}} behaved on first arrival to Iceland by taking refuge in some of the most inhospitable places, as if the land was inhabited by a hostile population. The start of [[Settlement of Iceland|Viking occupation of Iceland]] in the 870s prompted a second move of some of the Albans, this time to the fjords of southwestern Greenland and to central Labrador.&lt;ref name=Mowat/&gt;{{rp|p.249–263}}

==Newfoundland==
Mowat believes that the Albans discovered Newfoundland in the early 900s. With both suitable land for crofting and a large walrus population, this would have drawn Alban settlers, hunters and European traders southwards from southwestern Greenland and central Labrador. The resulting decline in these areas meant that when Vikings first started appearing off the Greenland coast at the end of the tenth century, it prompted a rapid and third large scale move of Albans, this time to Newfoundland.&lt;ref name=Mowat/&gt;{{rp|p.315–328}}

Mowat believes that the Albans settled mostly in southwest Newfoundland, along the coastline between [[Channel-Port aux Basques]] and [[Port au Port, Newfoundland and Labrador|Port au Port]].&lt;ref name=Mowat/&gt;{{rp|p.343–348}} Word of the wealth of this area reached the Vikings via traders, and became known to the Vikings as [[Great Ireland|Hvítramannaland or Albania]]. Mowat believes that the voyages of [[Leif Erikson]] and [[Thorfinn Karlsefni]] were in part attempts to raid Hvítramannaland which failed either due to being unable to find it,&lt;ref name=Mowat/&gt;{{rp|p.349–361}} or due to hostile encounters with local natives that the Vikings called [[Skræling]]s.&lt;ref name=Mowat/&gt;{{rp|p.362–377}}

Mowat suggests that the Albans continued to live in southwestern Newfoundland for several centuries, keeping a tenuous link to Europe through trade and clerical visits through the early Middle Ages.&lt;ref name=Mowat/&gt;{{rp|p.378–389}} This link broke in the 14th century, and the Albans were isolated until the voyages of [[John Cabot]] and the start of European fishing around Newfoundland. Predations by European pirates forced the Albans inland, possibly as far as [[King George IV Ecological Reserve|King George IV Lake]].&lt;ref name=Mowat/&gt;{{rp|p.440–454}} Although he considers it likely that their ethnic distinctiveness disappeared in intermarriage, Mowat suggests that a group of relatively dark-skinned Newfoundlanders known as the [[Métis people (Canada)|Jackatars]] (whose ethnic origins are unknown, but are most often thought of as a mix of [[Mi'kmaq]] and [[Acadian]] peoples), might conceivably be the last surviving descendants of the Albans.&lt;ref name=Mowat/&gt;{{rp|p.424–437}}

==Reactions==

[[Canadian Geographic]] published excerpts of the book in their Sept/Oct 1998 issue. The editors described the book as "a highly speculative blend of history and archeology. In it, Mowat again draws upon Norse sagas, the chronicles of Irish monks, accounts of Roman travellers, as well as the works of modern historians and archeologists. It is both detailed and, as with all early history, sketchy. The written record for much of the period covered is scant and the archeological record spotty. Still, such speculative writing can suggest avenues of exploration and study for future researchers. No professional archeologists are known to share Mowat’s theories but that does not disturb him. A literary gadfly for much of his long career, Mowat is happy to stir up debate and challenge academics to match the visions that he champions and defends with such vigour and relish."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Farley’s version|journal=Canadian Geographic|date=September–October 1998|url=http://www.canadiangeographic.ca/magazine/so98/farley-mowat-controversial-theory.asp|accessdate=17 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Richard Ellis of ''[[The New York Times]]'' stated that "''The Farfarers'' is worth reading, if for no other reason than to experience a provocative, alternative version of history, written by a master storyteller.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Ellis|first1=Richard|title=Eh? Farley Mowat's revisionist history of some very early Canadians.|journal=The New York Times|date=February 27, 2000|url=https://www.nytimes.com/books/00/02/27/reviews/000227.27ellist.html|accessdate=17 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;"

Stuart C. Brown of the Department of Anthropology, [[Memorial University]] stated that "As any competent archaeologist will tell you, in prehistory few things are impossible -- so Mowat's hypothesis cannot be simply dismissed out of hand. There is a small problem though, which must be overcome before an hypothesis can be at least provisionally accepted: the presentation of reasonably compelling evidence." Brown goes on to point out that there is no evidence at the Pamiok site that anyone other that Tunit used it. He concludes by saying "Can I recommend The Farfarers? Most certainly! I have always enjoyed Farley Mowat's writing and his abiding fascination with Canada and its past. To this tale he brings the full powers of his imagination but, while it is entertaining as fiction, it is far from convincing as fact."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Brown|first1=Stuart C.|title=The Farfarers. by Farley Mowat.|journal=Newfoundland and Labrador Studies|date=2003|volume=19|issue=1|url=https://journals.lib.unb.ca/index.php/nflds/article/view/146/248|accessdate=17 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[The Three Stooges]]' comedy routines have inspired generations of tributes in other media.  The following information is a partial list of such tributes.  Depending on the form of media used, there are direct and indirect references to the Three Stooges. Beginning with the Stooges themselves as the trio did make small guest appearances in movies or in small bumper clips for their cartoon series. Clips from the Stooges shorts are sometimes featured in the actual footage of a movie, TV show, or advertisement, or the line from the 1934 short ''[[Men in Black (1934 film)|Men in Black]]'', "Calling Dr. Howard, Dr. Fine, Dr. Howard" is used.  [[Moe Howard]], [[Larry Fine]], and [[Curly Howard]] (Or Curly [[Joe DeRita]]) appeared as cartoon versions of themselves.

The indirect references are harder to spot. These are the ones that fans of the shorts would instantly recognize, but another viewer not familiar with the series may not recognize. A careful viewing of all the original shorts reveals that each of the Stooges had his own signature haircut, catchphrase, and action. The easiest reference would be simply talking about the Stooges, or accusing another character of acting or reminding them of the Stooges.

Each Stooge had his own signature insult or catchphrase. While very rarely did any of the other Stooges insult or injure Moe, he did come up with the most insults of the entire group.  He frequently called Larry a porcupine. He used other insults such as mongoose, dope, hyena, applehead, soft-boiled egghead, grapehead, frizzletop, and birdbrain. While the catchphrases for each Stooges such as Moe's use of "Remind me to kill you later", Curly's with "Nyuk, nyuk, nyuk" or "woob, woob, woob", [[Shemp Howard]]'s noise babbling, and [[Joe Besser]]'s "Not so hard!", are nearly always paired with the signature haircut of the same Stooge.

For their haircuts, Moe had a bowl cut, Larry was bald on the top of his head with his remaining hair frizzled out, Shemp had a more loose hairstyle (It frequently fell into his face), while Curly, Joe, and Curly-Joe were all bald. Characters could appear in groups of three, sporting the signature haircuts.

Each Stooge developed his own signature action and reaction.  Moe would frequently eye-poke the others, to which they developed a signature hand block. He always slapped one of the others. Curly had a shuffle where he would spin on the floor. Larry played the violin. Joe would always give a soft punch to the arm while using his catchphrase. So characters may also act like the Stooges using their signature phrases and actions.

The hardest references to spot are the ones where only the names may be used such as a group of three being called Moe, Larry, and Curly. Places and buildings might have one of the Stooges names or the actors’ names. And perhaps the hardest of all, a character having a slight Stooge-like tone such as the elephant in ''[[Rabbit Fire]]''.

==Film==
In the film list, the action varies depending on the scene. If the Stooges themselves were used, clips from their shorts were shown such as in ''Lethal Weapon'' and ''Flubber''. However, in some cases, due to copyright demands of ''Columbia Pictures'', most often these scenes are edited out or the scene only uses the voices and sounds from the clips. Several scenes use the famous line "Calling Doctor Howard, Doctor Fine, Doctor Howard" from the 1934 short, ''Men in Black'', which can be heard in the background. Most often characters would be seen acting like Curly such as barking at people, using both hands to repeatedly clean the face, or using his catchphrase of "Nyuk, nyuk, nyuk.". Although the simplest reference used is when one character refers to another as the Three Stooges.

==Literature==
In printed media the idea of Stooges can be difficult to spot. Since most of the Stooges' traits were visual, the reader would have to be familiar with how the Stooges acted in their shorts, or details about the actors’ backgrounds in order to find the parody. The exception would be in comic books where the artist or author may leave an easy to spot reference.

===Children's Literature===
*The youthful protagonists of the ''[[Captain Underpants]]'' series of books attend Jerome Horwitz Elementary School.  The name Jerome Horwitz is both Curly Howard's real name, and the name of a famous scientist.

===Comic Books===
*Flash comics (DC) in the 1950s also included appearances by Wynken, Blynken and Nod, clearly modeled after the Stooges.
*The independent comic book ''[[Badger (comics)|The Badger]]'' has three bad guys named the Chisums resembling and acting like Moe, Larry and Curly kidnap an award-winning Bull from the main character to be able to sacrifice it and bring a demon to earth.
*The independent comic book ''[[Cerebus the Aardvark|Cerebus]]'' contains an homage to the Stooges as the "Three Wise Fellows" in the graphic novel ''Latter Days''. The three comically kidnap the main character, convinced that he is the messiah (meanwhile satirizing the Torah). While waiting for him to speak the "Word of Truth", they engage in hijinks such as clamping pliers on one another's noses over theological arguments.
*In an issue of ''[[The Incredible Hulk (comic book)|The Incredible Hulk]]'', the grey Hulk was saving his alter-ego's wife Betty Banner from large robots unleashed by the Hulk's nemesis, the Leader. Witnessing the battle the Hulk's sidekick, Rick Jones, narrates the story throughout the issue and refers to the three robots as Moe, Larry, and Curly.
*In the [[Marvel Comics]] ''[[Power Pack]]'' issues #21 and #46, two culprits are featured who are named (and whose appearances are patterned) after Moe and Larry of the Three Stooges.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.comics.org/issue/41324/ Comics.org: ''Power Pack'' #21]. Retrieved August 31, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;
*In ''[[The Sensational She-Hulk]]'' issue #5, Jennifer Walters is watching TV and came upon a short in homage to the Stooges renamed "The Three Amusing Fellows" where characters Moe and Curly were constructing a house and Moe scolds Curly for leaving on a chainsaw. Curly suggests Moe not to get too excited and recommends he let him have the chainsaw. Moe replies, "I'll let you have it, alright!" and saws Curly on the top of the head. In the next panel Jennifer was horrified to see blood and brains being scattered across the TV, when she knows that is not how it happens when she saw the short before. The cause of this was done by the evil scientist Doctor Bong.
*The Stooges themselves appeared in their own short-lived comic book series.

===Humor===
*In the book ''[[Garfield: His 9 Lives]]'', it is shown in Garfield's fourth life, he was a Moe-type character that led a group of mouse exterminators who resembled Larry and Curly. The exterminators were similar to the Stooges for their hair-styles, their slapstick ways of hurting each other, and their clumsiness of certain jobs.

===Magazines===
*In an issue of ''[[Crazy Magazine]]'', a parody of ''Quest for Fire'' retitled "Quest For Third Degree Burns", the three main characters on the quest were renamed Moe, Larry, and Curly.

===Novels===
*In Louis Sachar's children's novel ''[[The Boy Who Lost His Face]]'', a group of three children (one of which is a girl called "Mo") is nicknamed after the Stooges.
*In David Brin's novel ''The Uplift War'', an ambassador of the Tymbrini (an alien race with a pronounced sense of humor) considers the Stooges among humanity's finest philosophers.

==Music==
Music can be as difficult to determine the parody to the Stooges as print media. With the exception of [[Jump 'N the Saddle Band]]'s [[The Curly Shuffle]], or if the video to the song shows a clip from one of the shorts such as ''I Love This Bar'' by artist [[Toby Keith]], the listener would have to be familiar with how the Stooges looked and acted in their shorts.  The lyrics may refer to someone acting like / admiring the Three Stooges, refer to their names, hairstyles, or pre-Columbia work. The simplest reference can come from when a group names their band after trio such as the group [[The Stooges]].

''The Curly Shuffle'' was a direct homage and featured clips from 26 of the Curly-era Three Stooges shorts. Including ''An Ache in Every Stake'', ''A Bird in the Head'', ''Calling All Curs'', ''Punch Drunks'', ''No Census, No Feeling'', and ''A Plumbing We Will Go''.  Each lyric sang the praises of the Stooges and included imitations of some of their famous lines such as "Oh, wiseguy?" and "Nyuk, nyuk, nyuk".  All of the Stooges with the exception of Joe (Curly-Joe's image is used) are talked about in the lyrics.

Some songs such as "The Haircut Song" by Ray Stevens, Timbuk3's "Hairstyles and Attitudes", and Modern Band's "Moe" reference the Stooges unique hairstyles, while others like Meat Loaf's "Everything Louder Than Everything Else", Cherry Poppin’ Daddies' "Sockable Face Club", Frank Black's "Two Reelers", and Chris Brown's "Look At Me Now" contain small references to the trio.  The 1934 short ''Men in Black'' provides the line "Calling Dr. Howard, Dr. Fine, Dr. Howard".  The names or the actual voice/line is used as part of song/video such as in the background of the video to [["Weird Al" Yankovic]]’s "Like a Surgeon", or the title of a song on album ''Boppin’ the Blues'' by NRBQ.

Some artists go further in their references.  The Canadian rock group Rush used the Stooges' television series theme music, a derivative of "Three Blind Mice", as introductory music during their album ''Signals'' through ''Hold Your Fire Tours'', and again for the ''Vapor Trails Tour''. A picture of the Stooges and their names are included in the band's album ''Counterparts'' liner notes, and are included in the "assistance, inspiration, comic relief" listing.[2]

==Television==
===Advertisements===
*MasterCard, using its 'Priceless' themed ads, used the Stooges in one commercial.  Various pieces of the shorts that show of Moe, Larry, and Curly injuring each other are shown.  Clips from the following shorts are used: ''A Plumbing We Will Go, Dizzy Detectives'', ''Half-Wits Holiday'', ''Micro-Phonies'', ''Three Loan Wolves'', and ''Grips, Grunts and Groans''.

===Animation===
With animation, the creators can easily have characters look like the Stooges.  The easiest way to spot the look-a-likes is through the hair. Often a set of three characters (despite race, type, or even gender) will have the traditional haircuts of Moe, Larry, and Curly. Animators may combine this with Stooge antics such as eye-pokes, slaps, insults, phrases, and head-bops. If Stooge antics aren’t used, the personalities will be according to the hairstyle. If a character has Moe's haircut, they are usually the boss of the group, where as the one with Larry and Curly's hairstyles would act closer to a combination of the other Stooges.

The Three Stooges appear in their own self-titled video game for both the [[Nintendo Entertainment System]] and [[Game Boy]] series.  This game featured the Stooges as three heroes trying to raise money for an orphanage by a deadline while trying to outwit an evil bank owner. Pictures of Moe, Larry, and Curly appeared in the beginning as well as during the cracker eating game, and their voices can occasionally be heard during the game.  One mini-game featured Three Stooges Trivia.  While it was a game exclusively for the trio, it received many low reviews due to its bad game controls, slow timing, and lack of a true ending.

Theatre of the era is generally separated into the genres of tragedy and comedy. Some works by [[Plautus]], [[Terence]], and [[Seneca the Younger]] survive to this day. Eventually, theatre would represent an important aspect of Roman society because it would come to function as the primary means through which the Roman people could express their political emotions during the republican and imperial periods of Rome.&lt;ref&gt;William J. Slater, ''Roman Theater and Society,'' (Ann Arbor: The University of Michigan Press, 1996), vii.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Origins of Roman theatre ==
Rome was founded in 753 B.C.E as a monarchy under [[Etruscan civilization|Etruscan]] rule, and remained as such throughout the first two and a half centuries of its existence. Following the expulsion of Rome's last king, [[Lucius Tarquinius Superbus]], or "Tarquin the Proud," circa 509 B.C.E., Rome became a Republic, and was henceforth led by a group of magistrates elected by the Roman people. It is believed that Roman theatre was born during the first two centuries of the Roman Republic, following the spread of Roman rule into a large area of the Italian peninsula, circa 364 B.C.E.

Following the devastation of widespread plague in 364 B.C.E, Roman citizens began including theatrical games as a supplement to the [[Lectisternium]] ceremonies already being performed, in a stronger effort to pacify the gods. In the years following the establishment of these practices, actors began adapting these dances and games into performances by acting out texts set to music and simultaneous movement.

As the era of the Roman Republic progressed, citizens began including professionally performed drama in the eclectic offerings of the ludi (celebrations of public holidays) held throughout each year—the largest of these festivals being the [[Ludi Romani]], held each September in honor of the Roman god [[Jupiter (mythology)|Jupiter]].&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Theatre Histories: An Introduction|last=Zarrilli|first=Phillip B.|last2=McConachie|first2=Bruce|last3=Williams|first3=Gary Jay|last4=Fisher Sorgenfrei|first4=Carol|publisher=Routledge|year=2006|isbn=978-0-415-22728-5|location=|pages=102, 106|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was as a part of the Ludi Romani in 240 B.C.E. that author and playwright [[Livius Andronicus|Livius Adronicus]] became the first to produce translations of Greek plays to be performed on the Roman stage.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Roman Theatre|last=Moore|first=Timothy J.|publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=2012|isbn=9780521138185|location=|pages=|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Cambridge Guide to Theatre|last=Banham|first=Martin|publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=1995|isbn=9780521434379|location=|pages=|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Roman Theatre and Its Audience|last=Beacham|first=Richard C.|publisher=Harvard University Press|year=1991|isbn=9780674779143|location=|pages=|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The early drama that emerged was very similar to the drama in Greece. This was due to extensive contact between the Romans and the Greeks, which allowed the Romans to develop an interest in a new form of expression.&lt;ref&gt;Gesine Manuwald, ''Roman Republican Theatre, (''Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 2011), 15.&lt;/ref&gt;  Following the conclusion of the [[Third Macedonian War]] in 168 B.C.E., the Romans gained even more access to Greek culture, specifically in the arts, allowing for the Romans to further develop a basis for drama in their own society.&lt;ref&gt;Gesine Manuwald, ''Roman Republican Theatre, (''Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 2011), 17.&lt;/ref&gt; The development that occurred was first initiated by playwrights that were Greeks or half-Greeks living in Rome.&lt;ref&gt;Gesine Manuwald, ''Roman Republican Theatre, (''Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 2011), 18.&lt;/ref&gt; While Greek literary tradition in drama influenced the Romans, the Romans chose to not fully adopt these traditions, and instead the dominant local language of Latin was used.&lt;ref&gt;Gesine Manuwald, ''Roman Republican Theatre, (''Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 2011), 19.&lt;/ref&gt; These Roman plays that were beginning to be performed were heavily influenced by the Etruscan traditions, particularly regarding the importance of music and performance.&lt;ref&gt;Gesine Manuwald, ''Roman Republican Theatre, (''Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 2011), 25.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Genres of ancient Roman theatre ==
[[File:Actor as Papposilen Antikensammlung Berlin.jpg|thumb|A Roman actor playing ''[[Silenus|Papposilenus]]'', marble statue, c. 100 AD, after a Greek original from the 4th century BC]]
The first important works of [[Latin literature|Roman literature]] were the [[Tragedy|tragedies]] and [[Comedy (drama)|comedies]] written by [[Livius Andronicus]] beginning in 240 BC. Five years later, [[Gnaeus Naevius]], a younger contemporary of Andronicus, also began to write drama, composing in both genres as well. No plays from either writer have survived. By the beginning of the 2nd century BC, drama had become firmly established in Rome and a [[guild]] of writers (''collegium poetarum'') had been formed.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite book|title=History of the Theatre|last=Brockett|first=Oscar|last2=Hildy|first2=Franklin J.|publisher=Allyn and Bacon|year=2003|isbn=9780205358786|location=|pages=|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Roman tragedy ===
No early Roman tragedy survives, though it was highly regarded in its day; historians know of three early tragedians—[[Ennius]], [[Pacuvius]] and [[Lucius Accius]]. One important aspect of tragedy that differed from other genres was the implementation of choruses that were included in the action on the stage during the performances of many tragedies.&lt;ref name="Gesine Manuwald 2011"&gt;Gesine Manuwald, ''Roman Republican Theatre, (''Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 2011), 74.&lt;/ref&gt;

From the time of the empire, however, the work of two tragedians survives—one is an unknown author, while the other is the [[Stoicism|Stoic philosopher]] [[Seneca the Younger|Seneca]]. Nine of Seneca's tragedies survive, all of which are ''[[fabula crepidata|fabulae crepidatae]]'' (tragedies adapted from Greek originals); his ''[[Phaedra (Seneca)|Phaedra]]'', for example, was based on [[Euripides]]' ''[[Hippolytus (play)|Hippolytus]]''. Seneca is well known for composing works which feature a heavy presence of violence and horror.{{cn|date=October 2018}}

Seneca appears as a character in the tragedy ''[[Octavia (play)|Octavia]]'', the only [[Extant literature|extant]] example of ''[[fabula praetexta]]'' (tragedies based on Roman subjects, first created by [[Gnaeus Naevius|Naevius]]), and as a result, the play was mistakenly attributed as having been authored by Seneca himself. However, though historians have since confirmed that the play was not one of Seneca's works, the true author remains unknown.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

===Roman comedy===
{{see|Metres of Roman comedy}}
All Roman comedies that have survived can be categorized as ''[[fabula palliata]]'' (comedies based on Greek subjects) and were written by two dramatists: [[Plautus|Titus Maccius Plautus]] (Plautus) and [[Terence|Publius Terentius Afer]] (Terence). No ''[[fabula togata]]'' (Roman comedy in a Roman setting) has survived.

In adapting Greek plays to be performed for Roman audiences, the Roman comic dramatists made several changes to the structure of the productions. Most notable is the removal of the previously prominent role of the [[Greek chorus|chorus]] as a means of separating the action into distinct episodes. Additionally, musical accompaniment was added as a simultaneous supplement to the plays' [[dialogue]]. The action of all scenes typically took place in the streets outside the dwelling of the main characters, and plot complications were often a result of [[eavesdropping]] by a minor character.

[[Plautus]] wrote between 205 and 184 B.C. and twenty of his comedies survive to present day, of which his [[farce]]s are best known. He was admired for the [[wit]] of his dialogue and for his varied use of [[Meter (poetry)|poetic meters]]. As a result of the growing popularity of Plautus' plays, as well as this new form of written comedy, scenic plays became a more prominent component in Roman festivals of the time, claiming their place in events which had previously only featured races, athletic competitions, and gladiatorial battles.

All six of the comedies that [[Terence]] composed between 166 and 160 BC have survived. The complexity of his plots, in which he routinely combined several Greek originals into one production, brought about heavy criticism, including claims that in doing so, he was ruining the original Greek plays, as well as rumors that he had received assistance from high ranking men in composing his material. In fact, these rumors prompted Terence to use the prologues in several of his plays as an opportunity to plead with audiences, asking that they lend an objective eye and ear to his material, and not be swayed by what they may have heard about his practices. This was a stark difference from the written prologues of other known playwrights of the period, who routinely utilized their prologues as a way of prefacing the plot of the play being performed.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite book|title=The History of Greek &amp; Roman Theater|last=Bieber|first=Margarete|publisher=Princeton University Press|year=1961|isbn=|location=Princeton, NJ|pages=151–171|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

==== Stock characters in Roman comedy ====
[[File:Statuette actor Petit Palais ADUT00192.jpg|thumb|An ivory statuette of a Roman actor of tragedy, 1st century.]]
The following are examples of [[stock character]]s in Roman comedy:
* ''The '''adulescens''''' is an unmarried man, usually in late teens or twenties; his action typically surrounds the pursuit of the love of a prostitute or slave girl, who is later revealed to be a free-born woman, and therefore eligible for marriage. The ''adulescens'' character is typically accompanied by a clever slave character, who attempts to solve the ''adulescens''’ problems or shield him from conflict.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Facts on File Companion to Classical Drama|last=Thorburn|first=John E.|publisher=Infobase Publishing|year=2005|isbn=9780816074983|location=|pages=|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* The '''''senex''''' is primarily concerned with his relationship with his son, the ''adulescens''. Although he often opposes his son's choice of love interest, he sometimes helps him to achieve his desires. He is sometimes in love with the same woman as his son, a woman who is much too young for the ''senex''. He never gets the girl and is often dragged off by his irate wife.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;
* The '''''leno''''' is the character of the pimp or 'slave dealer.' Although the activities of the character are portrayed as highly immoral and vile, the ''leno'' always acts legally and is always paid in full for his services.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;
* The '''''miles gloriosus''''' is an arrogant, braggart soldier character, deriving from Greek Old Comedy. The character’s title is taken from a play of the same name written by Plautus. The ''miles gloriosus'' character is typically gullible, cowardly, and boastful.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=McGraw-Hill Encyclopedia of World Drama|last=Hochman|first=Stanley|publisher=VNR AG|year=1984|isbn=9780070791695|location=|pages=243|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* The '''''parasitus''''' (parasite) is often portrayed as a selfish liar. He is typically associated with the ''miles gloriosus'' character, and hangs upon his every word. The ''parasitus'' is primarily concerned with his own appetite, or from where he will obtain his next free meal.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;
* The '''''matrona''''' is the character of the wife and mother, and is usually displayed as an annoyance to her husband, constantly getting in the way of his freedom to pursue other women. After catching her husband with another woman, she typically ends the affair and forgives him. She loves her children, but is often temperamental towards her husband.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;
* The '''''virgo''''' (young maiden) is an unmarried young woman, and is the love interest of the ''adulescens'', She is often spoken of, but remains offstage. A typical plot point in the last act of the play reveals her to be of freeborn descent, and therefore eligible for marriage.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

== Roman theatre in performance ==

===Stage and physical space===
Beginning with the first presentation of theatre in Rome in 240 B.C., plays were often presented during public festivals. Since these plays were less popular than the several other types of events (gladiatorial matches, circus events, etc.) held within the same space, theatrical events were performed using temporary wooden structures, which had to be displaced and dismantled for days at a time, whenever other spectacle events were scheduled to take place. The slow process of creating a permanent performance space was due to the staunch objection of high-ranking officials: it was the opinion of the members of the senate that citizens were spending too much time at theatrical events, and that condoning this behavior would lead to corruption of the Roman public. As a result, no permanent stone structure was constructed for the purpose of theatrical performance until 55 B.C.E

During the time of these temporary structures, theatrical performances featured a very minimalist atmosphere. This included space for spectators to stand or sit to watch the play, known as a ''[[cavea]]'', and a stage, or ''scaena''. The setting for each play was depicted using an elaborate backdrop (''[[scaenae frons]]''), and the actors performed on the stage, in the playing space in front of the ''scaenae frons'', called the ''[[Proscenium|proscaenium]]''. These structures were erected in several different places, including temples, arenas, and at times, plays were held in Rome’s central square (the ''forum'').&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

In 55 B.C., the first permanent theatre was constructed. Built by Pompey the Great, the main purpose of this structure was actually not for the performance of drama, but rather, to allow current and future rulers a venue with which they could assemble the public and demonstrate their pomp and authority over the masses. With seating for 20,000 audience members, the grandiose structure held a 300-foot-wide stage, and boasted a three-story ''scaenae frons'' flanked with elaborate statues. The [[Theatre of Pompey]] is still in existence today.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

===Actors===
The first actors that appeared in Roman performances were originally from [[Etruria]]. This tradition of foreign actors would continue in Roman dramatic performances. Beginning with early performances, actors were denied the same political and civic rights that were afforded to ordinary Roman citizens because of the low social status of actors. In addition, actors were exempt from military service, which further inhibited their rights in Roman society because it was impossible for an individual to hold a political career without having some form of military experience. While actors did not possess many rights, slaves did have the opportunity to win their freedom if they were able to prove themselves as successful actors.&lt;ref&gt;Gesine Manuwald, ''Roman Republican Theatre,'' (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 2011), 22-24).&lt;/ref&gt;

Not everyone in the Roman community could become an actor because actors were required to have a physical presence and ability.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;Gesine Manuwald, ''Roman Republican Theatre, (''Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 2011), 73.&lt;/ref&gt; Stage acting required that actors implement grand gestures to accompany and emphasize their speeches. Actors also required strong voices because of the oration involved in their performances. They needed their voices to carry for lengthy periods of time in the open-air amphitheatres.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; Actors needed to have a strong musical voice because song was often involved in performances. Oftentimes, actors exchanged their lines rhythmically due to the musical nature of their performance. This rhythmic exchange also aided actors in projecting their voices in these open-air performances.&lt;ref name="Gesine Manuwald 2011"/&gt;

The spread of dramatic performance throughout Rome occurred with the growth of acting companies that are believed to have eventually begun to travel throughout all of Italy. These acting troupes were usually composed of four to six trained actors. Usually, two to three of the actors in the troupe would have speaking roles in a performance, while the other actors in the troupe would be present on stage as attendants to the speaking actors. For the most part, actors specialized in one genre of drama and did not alternate between other genres of drama.&lt;ref&gt;Gesine Manuwald, ''Roman Republican Theatre, (''Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 2011), 85.&lt;/ref&gt;

The most famous actor to develop a career in the late Roman Republic was [[Quintus Roscius Gallus]] (125BCE- 62CE). He was primarily known for his performances in the genre of comedy and became renowned for his performances among the elite circles of Roman society.&lt;ref&gt;William J. Slater, ''Roman Theater and Society,'' (Ann Arbor: University of Michigan Press, 1996), 36.&lt;/ref&gt; Through these connections he became intimate with [[Lucius Licinius Crassus]] (italicize name), the great orator and member of the Senate, and [[Sulla|Lucius Cornelius Sulla]].&lt;ref&gt;William J. Slater, ''Roman Theater and Society,'' (Ann Arbor: University of Michigan Press, 1996), 37.&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to the acting career Gallus would build, he also would take his acting abilities and use them to teach amateur actors the craft of becoming successful in the art. He would further distinguish himself through his financial success as an actor and a teacher of acting in a field that was not highly respected. Ultimately, he chose to conclude his career as an actor without being paid for his performances because he wanted to offer his performances as a service to the Roman people.&lt;ref&gt;William J. Slater, ''Roman Theater and Society,'' (Ann Arbor: University of Michigan Press, 1996), 41.&lt;/ref&gt;[[File:Young Folks' History of Rome illus046.png|thumb|300px|Roman actors.]]

Though the possibility exists that women may have performed non-speaking roles in Roman theatrical performances, the overwhelming majority of historical evidence dictates that male actors portrayed all speaking roles. The public opinion of actors was very low, placing them within the same social status as criminals and prostitutes, and acting as a profession was considered illegitimate and repulsive. Many Roman actors were slaves, and it was not unusual for a performer to be beaten by his master as punishment for an unsatisfactory performance. These actions and opinions differ greatly from those demonstrated during the time of [[Theatre of ancient Greece|ancient Greek theatre]], a time when actors were regarded as respected professionals, and were granted citizenship in Athens.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;[[File:Seneca-Cordoba.jpg|thumb|A sculpture of Lucius Annaeus Seneca, by Puerta de Almodóvar in Córdoba.]]

'''Thietmar''' (also '''Dietmar''' or '''Dithmar'''; 25 July 975 – 1 December 1018), [[Bishopric of Merseburg|Prince-Bishop of Merseburg]] from 1009 until his death, was an important [[chronicler]] recording the reigns of [[King of the Romans|German kings]] and [[Holy Roman Emperor]]s of the [[Ottonian Dynasty|Ottonian]] ([[Duchy of Saxony|Saxon]]) dynasty.  Two of Thietmar's great-grandfathers, both referred to Liuthar, were the Saxon nobles [[Lothar II, Count of Stade]], and [[Lothar I, Count of Walbeck]].  They were both killed fighting the Slavs at the [[Battle of Lenzen]].

==Life==
[[File:Merseburgerdom.JPG|thumb|Merseburg Cathedral where Thietmar worked]]
Thietmar was a son of the Saxon count [[Siegfried I the Older, Count of Walbeck|Siegfried I the Older]] of [[Walbeck, Börde|Walbeck]] (d. 990) and his wife Kunigunde (d. 997), daughter of [[Henry I the Bald, Count of Stade|Henry I the Bald]], Count of [[Stade]] ([[Udonids|House of Udonids]]). His father fought with Margrave [[Odo I, Margrave of the Saxon Ostmark|Odo]] against Duke [[Mieszko I of Poland]] at the 972 [[Battle of Cedynia]]. At the time of Thietmar's birth, his family sided with the Ottonian duke [[Henry II, Duke of Bavaria|Henry II of Bavaria]] ("the Wrangler") in his uprising against his cousin Emperor [[Otto II, Holy Roman Emperor|Otto II]]. Later, a balance was achieved; Siegfried became [[burgrave]] at [[Möckern]] and his brother Count [[Lothair, Margrave of the Nordmark|Lothair of Walbeck]] served as [[margrave]] of the [[Northern March]] from 983 until his death in 1003.

Baptized in [[Bishopric of Halberstadt|Halberstadt]], Thietmar prepared for an ecclesiastical career. He was educated at the St. Servatius chapter of [[Quedlinburg Abbey]] and from 987 onwards at the [[Order of Saint Benedict|Benedictine]] abbey of Berge in [[Buckau (Magdeburg)|Buckau]] near [[Magdeburg]]. From 1 November 990, he attended the Magedeburg [[cathedral school]], together with his relative [[Bruno of Querfurt]]. He was familiar with the works of [[Augustine of Hippo]], but even more with classical authors like [[Virgil]], [[Horace]], [[Lucan]], and [[Macrobius]].

Thietmar witnessed the struggles of the young Ottonian king [[Otto III, Holy Roman Emperor|Otto III]] and his mother [[Theophanu]] to secure their reign. He took some part in some political events of the time; in 994 he was a hostage in the hands of the [[Norsemen]], and he was not unfamiliar with the actualities of war.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|p=849}} Upon the death of his parents, he inherited large parts of the Walbeck estates and in 1002 became [[Provost (religion)|provost]] of the family monastery, established by his grandfather Count Lothair II. On 21 December 1004, he was ordained as a priest by Archbishop [[Tagino|Tagino of Magdeburg]].

In 1009, through the intercession of Archbishop Tagino, he became Bishop of the Merseburg diocese, which had been re-established by King [[Henry II, Holy Roman Emperor|Henry II]] in 1004. Thietmar was concerned with the full restitution of his bishopric. A loyal supporter of the German kingship, he rarely interfered in political affairs. He died on 1 December 1018 and was buried in [[Merseburg cathedral]].{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|p=849}}

==Thietmar's Chronicle==
[[File:Page of Thietmars Chronicle.jpg|right|200px|thumb|Page of Thietmar's Chronicle]]
Between 1012 and 1018 Thietmar, while Bishop of Merseburg, composed his chronicle ''Chronicon Thietmari'', which comprises eight books,{{sfn|Ott|1909}} that cover the period between 908 and 1018, the Saxon Emperors [[Henry the Fowler]], the three Ottos, and [[Henry II the Saint]]. As counsellor of the Emperor and participant in many important political transactions he was well equipped for writing a history of his times.

The first three books, covering the reigns of Henry I and the first two Ottos ([[Otto I]] and [[Otto II]]) are largely based on previous chronicles most of which are still extant (e.g. [[Widukind of Corvey]]'s ''[[Res gestae Saxonicae]]'', the ''[[Annals of Quedlinburg|Annales Quedlinburgenses]]'' and others); the fourth book, comprising the reign of [[Otto III]] contains much original matter; while the remaining four books, which describe the reign of Henry II to the year 1018, are the independent narrative of Thietmar and, besides being the principal source for Saxon history during the reign of Henry II, contain valuable information, not to be found elsewhere regarding the contemporary history and civilization of the [[Polabian Slavs|Slavic tribes]] east of the [[river Elbe]], as well as [[Poles]], [[Hungarians]] and [[Bulgarians]].{sfn|Ott|1909}}

The [[Latin]] style and the composition are not of a high standard, largely because, as the original [[manuscript]] reveals, Thietmar continued to make amendments and insertions to the text after it was completed. Nor does he always discriminate between important and unimportant events.{{citation needed|date=November 2011}}

The chronicle is nevertheless an excellent source for the history of [[Duchy of Saxony|Saxony]] during the reigns of the emperors Otto III and Henry II. No information is excluded by Thietmar, but the fullest details refer to the [[Bishopric of Merseburg]], and to the wars against the [[Wends]] (Polabian Slavs) and the Poles.{{citation needed|date=November 2011}}

The original manuscript was moved in 1570 to [[Dresden]]. When the city was destroyed by [[Bombing of Dresden in World War II|bombing during World War II]] the manuscript was severely damaged, and only a few folios remain intact. Fortunately a complete [[facsimile]] edition had been published by L. Schmidt (Dresden, 1905).{{citation needed|date=November 2011}}

Thietmar's statement that the [[Gero Cross]] in [[Cologne cathedral]] was commissioned by [[Gero (Archbishop of Cologne)|Archbishop Gero]], who died in 976, was dismissed by art historians, who thought he meant another cross, until the 1920s, and finally confirmed as correct in 1976 by [[dendrochronology]].&lt;ref name="Lauer"&gt;Lauer, Rolf.

'''United Nations Security Council resolution 573''', adopted on 4 October 1985, after hearing a complaint by [[Tunisia]], the Council condemned an [[Operation Wooden Leg|air raid]] on the country by the [[Israeli Air Force|Air Force]] of [[Israel]] on 1 October. The [[Palestine Liberation Organization]] (PLO) headquarters was targeted in the attack, after Israel had responded to the murder of three Israeli citizens in [[Cyprus]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Williamson|first=Myra|title=Terrorism, war and international law: the legality of the use of force against Afghanistan in 2001|publisher=Ashgate Publishing, Ltd.|year=2009|page=132|isbn=978-0-7546-7403-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Council reminded States to refrain from threats or the use of force in their [[international relations]], in accordance with the [[United Nations Charter]]. Considering that Israel had admitted to the attack immediately after carrying it out, the Council demanded that Israel refrain from further such attacks, urging Member States to dissuade Israel from doing so. It also noted that Tunisia had the right to reparations considering the loss of life and material damage caused.

Finally, Resolution 573 requested the [[Secretary-General of the United Nations|Secretary-General]] to submit a report on the implementation of the current resolution by 30 November 1985.

The resolution was adopted by 14 votes to none, with one [[abstention]] from the United States.

'''Vladimir Bogdanovich Rezun''', {{lang-ru|Влади́мир Богда́нович Резу́н}}, born April 20, 1947, in Barabash, [[Primorsky Krai]], and known as '''Viktor Suvorov''' ({{lang-ru|Ви́ктор Суво́ров}}), is a Russian writer and a former [[GRU|Soviet military intelligence]] officer who defected to the [[United Kingdom]]. Suvorov is best known for writing ''[[Icebreaker (Suvorov)|Icebreaker]]'' and several follow-up books on the history of [[World War II]].&lt;ref name="suvorovrezun"/&gt;

==Life and career==
Rezun comes from a military family of mixed [[Ukrainians|Ukrainian]]-[[Russians|Russian]] descent, having been either born or raised in [[Ukraine]]'s [[Cherkasy]], where his father served. The family subsequently settled in [[Ukrainian Soviet Socialist Republic]] after his retirement. According to Rezun, he studied in a [[Suvorov Military School]]: the one based in [[Voronezh]] (from 1958 to 1963) and later transferred to [[Tver|Kalinin]] (from 1963 to 1965).&lt;ref name="suvorovrezun"/&gt;

From 1965 to 1968, Rezun finished the Frunze [[Kiev]] Red Banner Higher Military Command School. In 1968, he served in the 145th Motorized Rifles Regiment of the [[Carpathian Military District]] in Ukraine, participating in the [[Warsaw Pact invasion of Czechoslovakia]]. In 1970 and 1971, he served in the [[Volga Military District]] Headquarters, and later with the 808th Independent Army Reconnaissance Company (''[[Spetsnaz GRU|Spetsnaz]]'').

After attending the Military Diplomatic Academy from 1971 to 1974, Rezun joined the Soviet mission to the [[United Nations Office at Geneva]], working undercover for the Soviet military intelligence service ([[Glavnoye Razvedyvatel'noye Upravleniye|GRU]]) and achieving a rank of Captain{{citation needed|date=April 2018}}.&lt;ref name="suvorovrezun"/&gt;

On June 10, 1978, Rezun defected to the [[United Kingdom]]. He was smuggled out of Switzerland to [[England]] with his wife and two young children, and he worked as an [[intelligence (information gathering)|intelligence]] analyst and lecturer.&lt;ref name="suvorovrezun"&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20130627164424/http://suvorovrezun.com/biography.html  Виктор Суворов, Биография.] Internet Archive.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/obituaries/3227310/Sir-Dick-Franks.html Sir Dick Franks. Saboteur with the Special Operations Executive who went on to become Chief of MI6 during the Cold War] – Obituary, published by Daily Telegraph on October 19, 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

Suvorov is also an occasional [[columnist]] for the Ukrainian [[UNIAN]] news agency's web site&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.unian.net/society/473541-suvorova-nagradili-zolotoy-medalyu-kafki.html Суворова наградили Золотой медалью Кафки : Новости УНИАН]{{ru icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, he states that he has never visited the countries of the former Soviet Union, fearing a pending [[search warrant]] and Soviet court conviction ''in absentia''.

At the time of his defection, [[Vladimir Rezun]] was married to Tatiana Korzh. The couple had a son, Aleksandr, and a daughter, Oksana. The family was successfully smuggled to England with Rezun.

== Publications ==
Suvorov made his name writing books about the Soviet Army, [[GRU|military intelligence]], and [[Spetsnaz|special forces]], including  ''[[The Liberators (Suvorov)|The Liberators]]'',&lt;ref&gt;''[[The Liberators (Suvorov)|The Liberators]]'', 1981, Hamish Hamilton Ltd, {{ISBN|0-241-10675-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Aquarium (Suvorov)|Aquarium]]'',&lt;ref&gt;''[[Aquarium (Suvorov)|Aquarium]]'' ({{lang|ru|Аквариум}}), 1985, Hamish Hamilton Ltd, {{ISBN|0-241-11545-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Inside the Soviet Army (Suvorov)|Inside the Soviet Army]]'',&lt;ref&gt;''[[Inside the Soviet Army (Suvorov)|Inside the Soviet Army]],'' 1982, Macmillan Publishing Co.&lt;/ref&gt; ''Inside Soviet Military Intelligence''&lt;ref&gt;''[http://militera.lib.ru/research/suvorov8/index.html Inside Soviet Military Intelligence]'', 1984, {{ISBN|0-02-615510-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; and ''Spetsnaz'',&lt;ref&gt;''[http://militera.lib.ru/research/suvorov6/index.html Spetsnaz]. The Story Behind the Soviet SAS'', 1987, Hamish Hamilton Ltd, {{ISBN|0-241-11961-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; which were partly based on his personal experience. He also joined the team led by the British General Sir [[John Winthrop Hackett Junior|John Hackett]] in writing the book ''The Third World War: The Untold Story''.&lt;ref name="untold_story"&gt;''The Third World War: The Untold Story'' {{ISBN|0-283-98863-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; Published in 1982, this book was the sequel to the 1978 original ''The Third World War'',&lt;ref name="wow3"&gt;''The Third World War'' {{ISBN|0-425-04477-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; in which Hackett and his team had speculated about the possible course of a Soviet/[[NATO]] war in [[Germany]].

=== Works about World War II ===
Suvorov has written ten books about the outbreak of the Nazi-Soviet War in 1941 and the circumstances that led to it.  The first such work was ''[[Icebreaker (Suvorov)|Icebreaker]]'', followed by ''[[M-Day (book)|M Day]]'', ''The Last Republic'', ''Cleansing'', ''[[Suicide (Viktor Suvorov book)|Suicide]]'', ''The Shadow of Victory'', ''I Take it Back'', ''The Last Republic II'', ''The Chief Culprit'', ''Defeat''.
{{further information|Soviet offensive plans controversy}}

According to Suvorov, [[Stalin]] planned to use [[Nazi Germany]] as a proxy (the “Icebreaker”) against the West. For this reason, Stalin provided significant material and political support to [[Adolf Hitler]], while at the same time preparing the [[Red Army]] to “liberate” the whole of [[Europe]] from Nazi occupation. Suvorov argued that Hitler had lost [[World War II]] from the very moment he attacked [[Poland]]: not only was he going to war with the powerful [[Allies of World War II|Allies]], but it was only a matter of time before the [[Soviet Union]] would seize the opportune moment to attack him from the rear. This left Hitler with no choice but to direct a preemptive strike at the Soviet Union, while Stalin's forces were redeploying from a defensive to an offensive posture in June 1941, providing Hitler with an important initial tactical advantage. However, this was strategically hopeless because the Nazis then had to fight on two fronts, a mistake Hitler himself had identified as Germany's undoing in the [[World War I|previous]] war. At the end of the war, Stalin was able to achieve only some of his initial objectives by establishing Communist regimes in [[Eastern Europe]] and [[North Korea]]. According to Suvorov, this made Stalin the primary winner of World War II, even though Stalin was not satisfied by the outcome, as he intended to bring Soviet domination to the whole continent of Europe.

The works by Suvorov remain a matter of debate among historians. While most agree that Stalin made extensive preparations for an upcoming war and exploited the military conflict in Europe to his advantage, the assertions that Stalin planned to attack Nazi Germany in the summer of 1941, and that [[Operation Barbarossa]] was a preemptive strike by Hitler, are disputed.

Viktor Suvorov also wrote fiction books set in the pre-World War II era in the Soviet Union. The first one, ''Control'', was followed by ''Choice'', and the last and most recent title was ''Snake-eater''. He has also written a film script based on these books.

'''Gushen''' (died 1140), also known as '''Wushi''' or '''Hushe''', and better known by his [[Sinicization|sinicised]] name '''Wanyan Xiyin''', was a [[Jurchen people|Jurchen]] noble and civil minister who lived in the founding and early years of the Jurchen-led [[Jin dynasty (1115–1234)]], which ruled northern China between the 12th and 13th centuries. He was a chief adviser to [[Emperor Taizu of Jin|Aguda (Emperor Taizu)]], the founder and first emperor of the Jin dynasty. Described by modern writers as the "Chief [[Shaman]]" of the pre-Jin Jurchen state,&lt;ref name=tao95&gt;Tao (1976),  Page 95.&lt;/ref&gt; he became deeply interested in [[Han Chinese]] culture, and is 
particularly known as the creator of the [[Jurchen script|first writing system]] for the [[Jurchen language]].

==Life==
Wanyan Xiyin's original Jurchen name is transcribed in Chinese sources as "Gushen", "Wushi" or "Hushe". He was from the [[Wanyan]] tribe, the ruling clan of the [[Jin dynasty (1115–1234)|Jin dynasty]], but was not in the direct imperial family line.&lt;ref name=f150&gt;Franke 1997(I), pp. 150-151.&lt;/ref&gt; His father was Huandu (歡都), a cousin of [[Emperor Taizu of Jin|Aguda (Emperor Taizu)]], the founder of the Jin dynasty. Along with [[Wanyan Zonghan|Nianhan (Wanyan Zonghan)]], Wanyan Xiyin was one of the chief advisers to Aguda. He helped Aguda in unifying the various Jurchen tribes under the Wanyan tribe's leadership, and overthrowing the [[Khitan people|Khitan]]-led [[Liao dynasty]].&lt;ref name=franke154&gt;Franke 1997(I), p. 154&lt;/ref&gt; After Aguda's death, Wanyan Xiyin continued to serve as a civil minister in the imperial court of [[Emperor Taizong of Jin|Wuqimai (Emperor Taizong)]], Aguda's younger brother and successor. However, he fell into disgrace during the reign of [[Emperor Xizong of Jin|Emperor Xizong]], Emperor Taizong's successor, and was eventually forced to commit suicide in 1140.&lt;ref name=f150/&gt;

According to contemporary Chinese sources, Wanyan Xiyin "was crafted and talented. It was he who personally devised laws and the script for the Jurchen, and thus shaped them into one state (''guo''; 國). The people of the state called him ''shan-man'' (珊蠻); shan-man in Jurchen refers to a [[shaman]]. This is because he understood changing conditions like a good. From [[Wanyan Zonghan|Nianhan]] down, nobody was able to be his equal."&lt;ref name=f155&gt;Franke 1997(I), pp. 155-156.&lt;/ref&gt;

As the translator of this text, [[Herbert Franke (sinologist)|Herbert Franke]], notes, this may be the earliest known Chinese document in which the term ''shanman'' (珊蠻) is attested; it corresponds to the [[Manchu language|Manchu]] ''saman'' ("shaman, sorcerer").&lt;ref name=f155/&gt;

Wanyan Xiyin was fascinated by [[Chinese classics]], and collected a large library when Jurchens [[Jingkang Incident|seized and looted]] the capital of the [[Northern Song dynasty]], Bianjing (present-day [[Kaifeng]]), in the [[Jin–Song Wars]]. He invited several [[Han Chinese]] scholars, led by [[Yuwen Xuzhong]] (宇文虛中; a Song envoy detained by the Jurchens), to advise him and to teach his sons and grandsons. [[Hong Hao]] (洪皓) – another Song envoy similarly detained by the Jurchens – though that it was under Yuwen Xuzhong's influence that a variety of Han Chinese cultural practices entered the Jin dynasty, such as the forms of government organisations, the scale of official ranks, salaries, and hereditary privileges, as well as the rules for assigning [[posthumous name]]s to emperors and the [[Naming taboo|taboo]] against using [[Chinese characters|characters]] that appear in emperors' names.&lt;ref name=tao&gt;Tao (1976), pages 31, 40.&lt;/ref&gt;
 
The instruction offered by Yuwen Xuzhong and other Han Chinese scholars must have been successful, as Wanyan Xiyin's sons were able to write Chinese poems for [[Hong Hao]]. The degree of their [[Sinicization|sinicisation]] was high enough for one of them to become one of the first Jurchens to have a Han Chinese wife.&lt;ref name=tao/&gt;

The tombs of Wanyan Xiyin and his family members are said to be located near present-day [[Shulan]], [[Jilin|Jilin Province]]. Since 1961, they have been listed on the provincial register of the protected historical sites.&lt;ref&gt;[http://jlwh.jllib.com/fengjing/indexfj_%20jlwyx.htm 完颜希尹家族墓地] (Wanyan Xiyin Family Tombs Site) {{zh icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Jurchen script==
{{main|Jurchen script}}

On Aguda's orders, in 1119 or 1120, Wanyan Xiyin created the Jurchen script, known as the "large-character script",  for use in the administration of the new Jurchen (Jin) Empire. He based it on [[Chinese characters]] and the [[Khitan scripts|Khitan script]].

[[File:Wittemoor Stelen.jpg|thumb|Female (left) and male cult figurines]]
The '''Wittemoor timber trackway''' is a log causeway or [[corduroy road]] across a bog at Neuenhuntdorf, part of the [[Berne, Germany|Berne]] in the district of [[Wesermarsch]] in [[Lower Saxony]], Germany. Originating in the pre-Roman [[Iron Age]], it is one of several such causeways which have been found in the North German Plain, particularly in the Weser-Ems region. It was excavated in 1965 and 1970 and [[Anthropomorphic wooden cult figurines of Central and Northern Europe|prehistoric wooden cult figurines]] were discovered in association with it. It is trackway number XLII (IP).

The trackway runs north-south and has been dated by [[dendrochronology]] to 135&amp;nbsp;[[BCE]]. It ran across the Wittemoor bog, connecting the more elevated [[geest]] at [[Hude]] with the River [[Hunte]]. An Iron Age settlement near a spring in the Lintel section of Hude was at the southern end. A section of the trackway has been reconstructed.

Six abstract wooden figurines were found during excavation of the trackway. The first were faceless male and female [[stele|stelae]], among the few Iron Age carvings to be preserved. Carved in silhouette out of oak planks {{convert|3|to|7|cm|in}} thick, they are highly stylised, the male about {{convert|105|cm|in}} tall with a rectangular body, the female about {{convert|95|cm|in}} tall with breasts or shoulders indicated by a slanted cut, broad hips and [[vulva]]. They stood on either side of the trackway at the point where it crosses a stream, the male figure slotted into a plank, the female on a small mound. Fire sites also on either side of the track, one at each end of the crossing, and stones and worked alder sticks around two simple cult poles immediately north of the female figure suggest that offerings were made there.&lt;ref&gt;Francesco Menotti, ''Wetland Archaeology and Beyond: Theory and Practice'', Oxford: Oxford University, 2012, {{ISBN|9780199571017}}, [https://books.google.com/books?id=9GXUfYTtbfMC&amp;pg=PA474&amp;lpg=PA474&amp;dq=XLII+%28IP%29+Wittemoor&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=lAMlZ5K7jA&amp;sig=FQyRo_Z8CeRgsKWmug7b--EUZjY&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=2GNUUs2iE6rwiwKfgoHgAw&amp;ved=0CEoQ6AEwBQ#v=onepage&amp;q=platforms%20for%20offerings&amp;f=false p. 168].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"Trackways and Ritual Deposition", ''The Oxford Handbook of Wetland Archaeology'', ed.

The site was excavated from 1987 to 1988; 186 burials were discovered at the site.

In one of the burials, tomb M45, the body of a tall adult male was flanked by two mosaics formed from white [[clam shells]], a [[tiger]] design to the right and a [[Chinese dragon|dragon]] design to the left. Clam shell mosaics were also found in two nearby caches. The burial was accompanied by the bodies of three young children. Some archaeologists believe that the man was a [[shaman]].

[[File:Bug de l'an 2000.jpg|thumb|An electronic sign at [[École centrale de Nantes]] displaying the year incorrectly as 1900 on 3 January 2000]]

The '''Year 2000 problem,''' also known as the '''Y2K problem''', the '''Millennium bug''', the '''Y2K bug''', or '''Y2K,''' is a class of [[computer bug]]s related to the [[Time formatting and storage bugs|formatting and storage of calendar data]] for dates beginning in the year 2000.  Problems were anticipated, and arose, because many programs represented four-digit years with only the final two digits — making the year 2000 indistinguishable from 1900.  The assumption of a twentieth-century date in such programs could cause various errors, such as the incorrect display of dates and the inaccurate ordering of automated dated records or real-time events.

In 1997, the [[British Standards Institute]] (BSI) developed [[Technical standard|standard]] DISC PD2000-1&lt;ref&gt;[http://parsifal.membrane.com/y2k/pd2000-4.htm BSI Standard] on year 2000.&lt;/ref&gt; defining "Year 2000 Conformity requirements" as four rules: (1) No valid date will cause any interruption in operations; (2) Calculation of durations between, or the sequence of, pairs of dates will be correct whether any dates are in different centuries; (3) In all interfaces and in all storage, the century must be unambiguous, either specified, or calculable by [[algorithm]]; (4) Year 2000 must be recognised as a leap year.

It identifies two problems that may exist in many [[computer programs]]. First, the practice of representing the year with two digits became problematic with logical error(s) arising upon "rollover" from xx99 to xx00. This had caused some date-related processing to operate incorrectly for dates and times on and after 1 January 2000, and on other critical dates which were billed "event horizons". Without corrective action, long-working systems would break down when the "... 97, 98, 99, 00 ..." ascending numbering assumption suddenly became invalid.

Secondly, some programmers had misunderstood the [[Gregorian calendar]] rule that determines whether years that are exactly divisible by 100 are not [[leap year]]s, and assumed that the year 2000 would not be a leap year. In reality, there is a rule in the Gregorian calendar system that states years divisible by 400 are leap years &amp;ndash; thus making 2000 a leap year.

Companies and organisations worldwide checked, fixed, and upgraded their computer systems to address the anticipated problem.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.wired.com/2000/02/leap-day-tuesday-last-y2k-worry|last=Wired|title=Leap Day Tuesday Last Y2K Worry|date=25 February 2000|accessdate=16 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a result, very few computer failures were reported when the clocks rolled over into 2000.&lt;ref name=bbc_boost&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/sci/tech/590932.stm| title=Was Y2K bug a boost?|last=Carrington|first=Damian|date=4 January 2000|publisher=BBC News|accessdate=19 September 2009|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20040422221434/http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/science/nature/590932.stm|archivedate=22 April 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
Y2K is a [[numeronym]] and was the common abbreviation for the year 2000 software problem. The abbreviation combines the letter ''Y'' for "year", and ''k'' for the SI unit prefix [[kilo-|kilo]] meaning 1000; hence, ''2K'' signifies 2000. It was also named the "Millennium Bug" because it was associated with the popular (rather than literal) roll-over of the [[millennium]], even though most of the problems could have occurred at the end of ''any'' ordinary century.

The Year 2000 problem was the subject of the early book, ''Computers in Crisis'' by Jerome and Marilyn Murray (Petrocelli, 1984; reissued by [[McGraw-Hill]] under the title ''The Year 2000 Computing Crisis'' in 1996). The first recorded mention of the Year 2000 Problem on a [[Usenet]] newsgroup occurred on Friday, 18 January 1985, by Usenet poster Spencer Bolles.&lt;!--&lt;ref&gt;[http://groups.google.com/ Google Groups] – &lt;span class="plainlinks"&gt;[http://groups.google.com/groups/dir?sel=33600196 net].[http://groups.google.com/group/net.bugs/topics bugs]&lt;/span&gt;

The acronym Y2K has been attributed to David Eddy, a Massachusetts programmer,&lt;ref&gt;[http://americanradioworks.publicradio.org/index.html American RadioWorks] [http://americanradioworks.publicradio.org/features/y2k/notebook.html Y2K Notebook Problems] – ''[http://americanradioworks.publicradio.org/features/y2k/a2.html The Surprising Legacy of Y2K]''. Retrieved on 22 April 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; in an e-mail sent on 12 June 1995. He later said, "People were calling it CDC (Century Date Change), FADL (Faulty Date Logic). There were other contenders. Y2K just came off my fingertips."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://articles.baltimoresun.com/1999-12-22/news/9912220295_1_y2k-term-masters|last=Rose|first=Ted|title=Who invented Y2K and why did it become so universally popular?|date=22 December 1999|accessdate=11 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The problem started because on both mainframe computers and later personal computers, storage was expensive, from as low as $10 per kilobyte, to in many cases as much as or even more than US$100 per kilobyte.&lt;ref&gt;A web search on images for "computer memory ads 1975" returns advertisements showing pricing for 8K of memory at $990 and 64K of memory at $1495.&lt;/ref&gt; It was therefore very important for programmers to reduce usage. Since programs could simply prefix "19" to the year of a date, most programs internally used, or stored on disc or tape, data files where the date format was six digits, in the form MMDDYY, MM as two digits for the month, DD as two digits for the day, and YY as two digits for the year. As space on disc and tape was also expensive, this also saved money by reducing the size of stored data files and data bases.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.comlinks.com/mag/accr.htm|title= Accrued Savings of the Year 2000 Computer Date Problem|last= Kappelman|first= Leon|last2= Scott|first2= Phil|date= 25 November 1996|publisher= Computerworld}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many computer programs stored years with only two decimal digits; for example, 1980 was stored as 80. Some such programs could not distinguish between the year 2000 and the year 1900. Other programs tried to represent the year 2000 as 19100. This could cause a complete failure and cause date comparisons to produce incorrect results. Some [[embedded system]]s, making use of similar date logic, were expected to fail and cause utilities and other crucial infrastructure to fail.

Some warnings of what would happen if nothing was done were particularly dire:

&lt;blockquote&gt;The Y2K problem is the electronic equivalent of the [[El Niño]] and there will be nasty surprises around the globe. ''— [[John Hamre]], United States Deputy Secretary of Defense''&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cnn.com/TECH/specials/y2k/ Looking at the Y2K bug], portal on [[CNN]].com {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060207191845/http://www.cnn.com/TECH/specials/y2k/ |date=7 February 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Special committees were set up by governments to monitor remedial work and [[contingency plan]]ning, particularly by crucial infrastructures such as telecommunications, utilities and the like, to ensure that the most critical services had fixed their own problems and were prepared for problems with others. While some commentators and experts argued that the coverage of the problem largely amounted to [[scaremongering]],&lt;ref name=Fry&gt;{{cite episode|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/iplayer/episode/b00mz53r/Archive_on_4_In_the_Beginning_Was_the_Nerd/|title=In the beginning was the nerd|series=Archive on 4|network=BBC Radio 4|credits=Presenter: [[Stephen Fry]]|airdate=2009-10-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; it was only the safe passing of the main "event horizon" itself, 1 January 2000, that fully quelled public fears. Some experts who argued that scaremongering was occurring, such as [[Ross J. Anderson (professor)|Ross Anderson]], Professor of [[Security engineering|Security Engineering]] at the [[University of Cambridge Computer Laboratory]], have since claimed that despite sending out hundreds of [[press release]]s about research results suggesting that the problem was not likely to be as big a problem as some had suggested, they were largely ignored by the media.&lt;ref name=Fry/&gt;

==Programming problem==
The practice of using two-digit dates for convenience predates computers, but was never a problem until stored dates were used in calculations.

===The need for bit conservation===
{{quote box|align=right|width=35em|"I'm one of the culprits who created this problem. I used to write those programs back in the 1960s and 1970s, and was proud of the fact that I was able to squeeze a few elements of space out of my program by not having to put a 19 before the year. Back then, it was very important. We used to spend a lot of time running through various mathematical exercises before we started to write our programs so that they could be very clearly delimited with respect to space and the use of capacity. It never entered our minds that those programs would have lasted for more than a few years. As a consequence, they are very poorly documented. If I were to go back and look at some of the programs I wrote 30 years ago, I would have one terribly difficult time working my way through step-by-step."|—[[Alan Greenspan]], 1998&lt;ref&gt;Testimony by [[Alan Greenspan]], ex-Chairman of the [[Federal Reserve]] before the [[Senate Banking Committee]], 25 February 1998, {{ISBN|978-0-16-057997-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

In the first half of the 20th century, well before the computer era, business data processing was done using [[unit record equipment]] and [[punched card]]s, most commonly the 80-column variety employed by IBM, which dominated the industry. Many tricks were used to squeeze needed data into fixed-field 80-character records. Saving two digits for every date field was significant in this effort.

In the 1960s, computer memory and mass storage were scarce and expensive. Early [[core memory]] cost one dollar per bit. Popular commercial computers, such as the [[IBM 1401]], shipped with as little as 2&amp;nbsp;kilobytes of memory. Programs often mimicked card processing techniques. Commercial programming languages of the time, such as [[COBOL]] and [[IBM RPG|RPG]], processed numbers in their character representations. Over time the punched cards were converted to [[magnetic tape data storage|magnetic tape]] and then disc files, but the structure of the data usually changed very little. Data was still input using punched cards until the mid-1970s. Machine architectures, programming languages and application designs were evolving rapidly. Neither managers nor programmers of that time expected their programs to remain in use for many decades. The realisation that databases were a new type of program with different characteristics had not yet come.

There were exceptions, of course. The first person known to publicly address this issue was [[Bob Bemer]], who had noticed it in 1958 as a result of work on genealogical software. He spent the next twenty years trying to make programmers, [[International Business Machines|IBM]], the [[Federal government of the United States|government of the United States]] and the [[International Organization for Standardization|ISO]] aware of the problem, with little result. This included the recommendation that the COBOL [[Picture clause|PICTURE clause]] should be used to specify four digit years for dates.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/articles/A4138-2004Jun24.html |title=Key computer coding creator dies |work=The Washington Post |accessdate=25 September 2011 |date=25 June 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite magazine articles on the subject from 1970 onward, the majority of programmers and managers only started recognising Y2K as a looming problem in the mid-1990s, but even then, inertia and complacency caused it to be mostly unresolved until the last few years of the decade. In 1989, [[Erik Naggum]] was instrumental in ensuring that internet mail used four digit representations of years by including a strong recommendation to this effect in the internet host requirements document RFC 1123.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc1123|last=Braden |first=Robert (ed.) |title=Requirements for Internet Hosts -- Application and Support |date=October 1989 |publisher=Internet Engineering Task Force |accessdate=16 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Saving space on stored dates persisted into the Unix era, with most systems representing dates to a single 32-bit word, typically representing dates as [[Unix time|elapsed seconds from some fixed date]], which causes the similar [[Y2K38 problem]].

===Resulting bugs from date programming===
[[File:JavaScript getYear Method Problem.png|thumb|Webpage screenshots showing the [[JavaScript]] .getYear() method problem, which depicts the Year 2000 problem]]
[[File:Apple Lisa Workshop.png|thumbnail|thumb|An [[Apple Lisa]] does not accept the date]]
Storage of a combined date and time within a fixed binary field is often considered a solution, but the possibility for software to misinterpret dates remains because such date and time representations must be relative to some known origin. Rollover of such systems is still a problem but can happen at varying dates and can fail in various ways. For example:
* The [[Microsoft Excel]] spreadsheet program had a very elementary Y2K problem: Excel (in both Windows and Mac versions, when they are set to start at 1900) incorrectly set the year 1900 as a leap year for compatibility with Lotus 1-2-3.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://support.microsoft.com/kb/214326 |last=Microsoft Support |title=Microsoft Knowledge Base article 214326 |date=17 December 2015 |accessdate=16 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, the years 2100, 2200, and so on, were regarded as leap years. This bug was fixed in later versions, but since the [[Epoch (reference date)|epoch]] of the Excel timestamp was set to the meaningless date of [[0 January]] 1900 in previous versions, the year 1900 is still regarded as a leap year to maintain backward compatibility.
* In the [[C (programming language)|C programming language]], the standard library function to extract the year from a timestamp returns the year minus 1900. Many programs using functions from C, such as [[Perl]] and [[Java (programming language)|Java]], two programming languages widely used in web development, incorrectly treated this value as the last two digits of the year. On the web this was usually a harmless presentation bug, but it did cause many dynamically generated web pages to display 1 January 2000 as "1/1/19100", "1/1/100", or other variants, depending on the display format. {{Citation needed|date=October 2010|reason="many". Please quantify and give examples of sites where this did or would have happened if not caught}}
* [[JavaScript]] was changed due to concerns over the Y2K bug, and the return value for years changed and thus differed between versions from sometimes being a four digit representation and sometimes a two-digit representation forcing programmers to rewrite already working code to make sure web pages worked for all versions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=JavaScript Reference Javascript 1.2| publisher=[[Sun Microsystems]]|url=http://docs.sun.com/source/816-6410-10/date.htm#1194138| accessdate=7 June 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=JavaScript Reference Javascript 1.3|publisher=Sun
|url=http://docs.sun.com/source/816-6408-10/date.htm#1194138|accessdate=7 June 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Older applications written for the commonly used UNIX [[Source Code Control System]] failed to handle years that began with the digit "2".
* In the Windows 3.x file manager, dates displayed as 1/1/&lt;!-- immutable date format--&gt;19:0 for 1/&lt;!-- immutable date format--&gt;1/2000 (because the colon is the character after "9" in the [[ASCII]] character set). An update was available.
* Some software, such as [[Math Blaster Episode I: In Search of Spot]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MillenniumBug |last=TVTropes |title=Millennium Bug - Television Tropes &amp; Idioms |accessdate=16 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; which only treats years as two-digit values instead of four, will give a given year as "1900", "1901", and so on, depending on the last two digits of the present year.

===Date bugs similar to Y2K===
{{main article|Time formatting and storage bugs}}

====4 January 1975 ====
This date overflowed the 12-bit field that had been used in the Decsystem 10 operating systems. There were numerous problems and crashes related to this bug while an alternative format was developed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://catless.ncl.ac.uk/Risks/4.45.html|title=The Risks Digest Volume 4: Issue 45|work=The Risks Digest}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====9 September 1999====
Even before 1 January 2000 arrived, there were also some worries about 9 September 1999 (albeit less than those generated by Y2K). Because this date could also be written in the numeric format 9/9/99, it could have conflicted with the date value &lt;code&gt;9999&lt;/code&gt;, frequently used to specify an unknown date. It was thus possible that database programs might act on the records containing unknown dates on that day. Data entry operators commonly entered 9999 into required fields for an unknown future date, (e.g., a termination date for cable television or telephone service), in order to process computer forms using [[CICS]] software.&lt;ref&gt;Stockton, J.R., "[http://www.merlyn.demon.co.uk/critdate.htm Critical and Significant Dates]" ''Merlyn''.&lt;/ref&gt; Somewhat similar to this is the end-of-file code &lt;code&gt;9999&lt;/code&gt;, used in older programming languages. While fears arose that some programs might unexpectedly terminate on that date, the bug was more likely to confuse computer operators than machines.

====Leap years====
{{Main article|Zeller's congruence}}
Normally, a year is a leap year if it is evenly divisible by four. A year divisible by 100, however, is not a leap year in the Gregorian calendar unless it is also divisible by 400. For example, 1600 was a leap year, but 1700, 1800 and 1900 were not. Some programs may have relied on the oversimplified rule that ''a year divisible by four is a leap year''. This method works fine for the year 2000 (because it is a leap year), and will not become a problem until 2100, when older legacy programs will likely have long since been replaced. Other programs contained incorrect leap year logic, assuming for instance that no year divisible by 100 could be a leap year. An assessment of this ''leap year problem'' including a number of real life code fragments appeared in 1998.&lt;ref&gt;A. van Deursen, "[http://www.st.ewi.tudelft.nl/~arie/papers/klint.pdf The Leap Year Problem]" ''The Year/2000 Journal'' 2(4):65–70, July/August 1998.&lt;/ref&gt; For information on why century years are treated differently, see [[Gregorian calendar]].

====Year 2010 problem====
Some systems had problems once the year rolled over to 2010. This was dubbed by some in the media as the "Y2K+10" or "Y2.01K" problem.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.crn.com.au/News/163864,bank-of-queensland-hit-by-y201k-glitch.aspx|last=CRN|title=Bank of Queensland hit by "Y2.01k" glitch|date= 4 January 2010|accessdate=16 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The main source of problems was confusion between hexadecimal number encoding and [[binary-coded decimal]] encodings of numbers. Both hexadecimal and BCD encode the numbers 0–9 as 0x0–0x9. But BCD encodes the number 10 as 0x10, whereas hexadecimal encodes the number 10 as 0x0A; 0x10 interpreted as a hexadecimal encoding represents the number 16.

For example, because the SMS protocol uses BCD for dates, some mobile phone software incorrectly reported dates of SMSes as 2016 instead of 2010. [[Windows Mobile]] is the first software reported to have been affected by this glitch; in some cases WM6 changes the date of any incoming SMS message sent after 1 January 2010 from the year "2010" to "2016".&lt;ref name=wm6&gt;{{cite web|url= http://news.cnet.com/8301-13860_3-10425455-56.html?tag=newsLatestHeadlinesArea.0#addcomm|title= Windows Mobile glitch dates 2010 texts 2016|date= 5 January 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="cellphone2010"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.techradar.com/news/world-of-tech/windows-mobile-phones-suffer-y2k-10-bug-661062|title=Windows Mobile phones suffer Y2K+10 bug|date=4 January 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other systems affected include [[EFTPOS]] terminals,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.itwire.com/content/view/30308/53/|title=Bank of Queensland vs Y2K – an update|date=4 January 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[PlayStation 3]] (except the Slim model).&lt;ref name="PS3-1"&gt;{{cite web|url= https://gizmodo.com/5482365/error-8001050f-takes-down-playstation-network|title=Error: 8001050F Takes Down PlayStation Network}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The most important occurrences of such a glitch were in Germany, where upwards of 20 million bank cards became unusable, and with Citibank Belgium, whose digipass customer identification chips failed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rtlinfo.be/info/monde/europe/297916/bug-de-l-an-2010-en-allemagne-plus-de-20-millions-de-cartes-bancaires-inutilisables|last=RTL|title=2010 Bug in Germany|date=5 January 2010|accessdate=16 October 2016|language=French}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Year 2038 problem====
{{main article|Year 2038 problem}}

The original [[Unix time]] datatype (&lt;code&gt;[[time_t]]&lt;/code&gt;) stores a date and time as a signed long integer (on 32-bit systems a 32-bit integer) representing the number of seconds since 1 January 1970. During and after 2038, this number will exceed 2{{sup|31}}&amp;nbsp;−&amp;nbsp;1, the largest number representable by a signed [[long integer]] on 32-bit systems, causing the [[Year 2038 problem]] (also known as the Unix Millennium bug or [[Y2K38]]). As a long integer in 64-bit systems uses 64 bits, the problem does not realistically exist on 64-bit systems that use the [[LP64]] model.

==Programming solutions{{anchor|bugfix}}==
Several very different approaches were used to solve the Year 2000 problem in legacy systems. Four of them follow:
;Date expansion
: Two-digit years were expanded to include the century (becoming four-digit years) in programs, files, and databases. This was considered the "purest" solution, resulting in unambiguous dates that are permanent and easy to maintain. However, this method was costly, requiring massive testing and conversion efforts, and usually affecting entire systems. Because the cost of expanding a BCD encoded value which requires only the 0x00 through 0x99 values of a byte to include all years up to 0x9999 is the addition of another [[byte|octet]], it is therefore more sensible to simply represent as a binary 14-bit number, though because of [[Data structure alignment|word alignment]] at that point it is easier just to use an [[unsigned short]] for years. Such a scheme is capable of representing 65536 different years; the exact scheme varies by the selection of [[Unix Epoch|epoch]].
;Date re-partitioning
: In legacy databases whose size could not be economically changed, six-digit year/month/day codes were converted to three-digit years (with 1999 represented as 099 and 2001 represented as 101, etc.) and three-digit days ([[ordinal date]] in year). Only input and output instructions for the date fields had to be modified, but most other date operations and whole record operations required no change. This delays the eventual roll-over problem to the end of the year 2899.
;[[Date windowing|Windowing]]
: Two-digit years were retained, and programs determined the century value only when needed for particular functions, such as date comparisons and calculations. (The century "window" refers to the 100-year period to which a date belongs). This technique, which required installing small patches of code into programs, was simpler to test and implement than date expansion, thus much less costly. While not a permanent solution, windowing fixes were usually designed to work for several decades. This was thought acceptable, as older legacy systems tend to eventually get replaced by newer technology.&lt;ref&gt;"''The Case for Windowing: Techniques That Buy 60 Years''", article by Raymond B. Howard, Year/2000 Journal, Mar/Apr 1998.&lt;/ref&gt;
;Software Solutions
: In 1996, [[Rudy Rupak]] created the Millennium Bug Kit. This [[freeware]] solution was one of the first downloadable solutions on the internet at the time and was found in one in four computers&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cnn.com/TECH/computing/9909/22/top.y2k.idg/|title=CNN - Top 10 Y2K fixes for your PC - September 22, 1999|first=Max|last=Green|website=www.cnn.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; and marketed through Planet City Software as Millennium Bug Compliance Kit.

Some software did not correctly recognise 2000 as a leap year, and so worked on the basis of the year having 365 days. On the last day of 2000 (day 366) these systems exhibited various errors. These were generally minor, apart from reports of some Norwegian trains that were delayed until their clocks were put back by a month.&lt;ref name="bbc-last bite bugs"&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/sci/tech/1101917.stm The last bite of the bug], report from [[BBC News]], 5 January 2001.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Government responses==

===Bulgaria===
Although only two digits are allocated for the birth year in the [[Uniform civil number|Bulgarian national identification number]], the [[year 1900 problem]] and subsequently the Y2K problem were addressed by the use of unused values above 12 in the month range. For all persons born before 1900, the month is stored as the calendar month plus 20, and for all persons born after 1999, the month is stored as the calendar month plus 40.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Iliana V. Kohler |author2=Jordan Kaltchev |author3=Mariana Dimova |url=http://www.demographic-research.org/volumes/vol6/12/6-12.pdf |title=Integrated Information System for Demographic Statistics 'ESGRAON-TDS' in Bulgaria |publisher=Demographic Research |volume=6 Article 12 |pages=325–354}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Netherlands===
The Dutch Government promoted Y2K Information Sharing and Analysis Centers (ISACs) to share readiness between industries, without threat of antitrust violations or liability based on information shared.

===Norway and Finland===
Norway and Finland changed their [[national identification number]], to indicate the century in which a person was born. In both countries, the birth year was historically indicated by two digits only. This numbering system had already given rise to a similar problem, the "[[Year 1900 problem]]", which arose due to problems distinguishing between people born in the 20th and 19th centuries. Y2K fears drew attention to an older issue, while prompting a solution to a new problem. In Finland, the problem was solved by replacing the hyphen ("-") in the number with the letter "A" for people born in the 21st century (for people born before 1900, the sign was already "+"). In Norway, the range of the individual numbers following the birth date was altered from 0–499 to 500–999.

===Uganda===
The [[Ugandan government]] responded to the Y2K threat by setting up a Y2K Task Force.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://parsifal.membrane.com/y2k/y2kugand.htm |title=Uganda National Y2k Task Force End-June 1999 Public Position Statement |date=30 June 1999 |accessdate=11 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; In August 1999 an independent international assessment by the World Bank International Y2k Cooperation Centre found that Uganda's website was in the top category as "highly informative". This put Uganda in the "top 20" out of 107 national governments, and on a par with the United States, United Kingdom, Canada, Australia and Japan, and ahead of Germany, Italy, Austria, Switzerland which were rated as only "somewhat informative". The report said that "Countries which disclose more Y2k information will be more likely to maintain public confidence in their own countries and in the international markets."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://greenspun.com/bboard/q-and-a-fetch-msg.tcl?msg_id=001BVY |title=Y2K Center urges more information on Y2K readiness |date=3 August 1999 |accessdate=11 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===United States===
In 1998, the [[Federal government of the United States|United States government]] responded to the Y2K threat by passing the Year 2000 Information and Readiness Disclosure Act, by working with private sector counterparts in order to ensure readiness, and by creating internal continuity of operations plans in the event of problems. The effort was coordinated out of the White House by the President's Council on Year 2000 Conversion, headed by [[John Koskinen]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.cnn.com/TECH/computing/9902/23/shift.y2k.idg |last1=DeBruce |first1=Orlando |last2=Jones |first2=Jennifer|title=White House shifts Y2K focus to states | date=23 February 1999 |publisher=CNN | accessdate=16 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[White House]] effort was conducted in co-ordination with the then-independent [[Federal Emergency Management Agency]] (FEMA), and an interim Critical Infrastructure Protection Group, then in the Department of Justice, now in Homeland Security.

The US Government followed a three-part approach to the problem: (1) outreach and advocacy, (2) monitoring and assessment, and (3) contingency planning and regulation.&lt;ref name="wutc.wa.gov"&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.wutc.wa.gov/webdocs.nsf/b8da29aede8fdd67882571430005a9c1/c1cf57ff131085ca88256744007e1440/$FILE/Y2kcsr.pdf |title=FCC Y2K Communications Sector Report (March 1999) copy available at WUTC }}&amp;nbsp;{{small|(1.66&amp;nbsp;MB)}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Y2K Logo.gif|thumb|right|The logo created by The President's Council on the Year 2000 Conversion, for use on Y2K.gov]]

A feature of US Government outreach was Y2K websites including Y2K.GOV. Presently, many US Government agencies have taken down their Y2K websites. Some of these documents may be available through [[National Archives and Records Administration]]&lt;ref&gt;See [http://clinton3.nara.gov/WH/Work/101998.html President Clinton: Addressing the Y2K Problem, White House, 19 October 1998].&lt;/ref&gt; or the [[Wayback Machine]].

Each federal agency had its own Y2K task force which worked with its private sector counterparts. The FCC had the FCC Year 2000 Task Force.&lt;ref name="wutc.wa.gov" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.opengroup.org/comm/the_message/magazine/mmv5n5/view.htm |title=Federal Communications Commission Spearheads Oversight of the U.S. Communications Industries' Y2K Preparedness, Robert J Butler and Anne E Hoge, Wiley, Rein &amp; Fielding September/October 1999 |publisher=Opengroup |accessdate=16 October 2016 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081009053904/http://www.opengroup.org/comm/the_message/magazine/mmv5n5/view.htm |archivedate=9 October 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Most industries had contingency plans that relied upon the internet for backup communications. However, as no federal agency had clear authority with regard to the internet at this time (it had passed from the US Department of Defense to the US National Science Foundation and then to the US Department of Commerce), no agency was assessing the readiness of the internet itself. Therefore, on 30 July 1999, the White House held the White House Internet Y2K Roundtable.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.ncs.gov/library/telcom/tn_99-02.pdf |title=Basic Internet Structures Expected to be Y2K Ready, Telecom News, NCS (1999 Issue 2) }}&amp;nbsp;{{small|(799&amp;nbsp;KB)}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The U.S. Government also established a [[Center for Year 2000 Strategic Stability]], as a joint operation with the [[Russian Federation]]. It was a liaison operation designed to mitigate the possibility of false positive readings in each nation's nuclear attack early warning systems.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=U.S., Russia Shutter Joint Y2k Bug Center|url=http://articles.chicagotribune.com/2000-01-16/news/0001160164_1_missile-peterson-air-force-base-y2k|accessdate=28 January 2017|work=[[Chicago Tribune]]|date=16 January 2000}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Juno ISP CD.jpg|alt=A CD marking its software as Y2K Complaint|thumb|Juno Internet Service Provider CD labeling Y2K-compliance]]

===United Kingdom===
The British government made regular assessments of the progress made by different sectors of business towards becoming Y2K-compliant and there was wide reporting of sectors which were laggards.   Companies and institutions
were classified according to a traffic light scheme ranging from green "no problems" to red "grave doubts whether the work can be finished in time".   Many organisations finished far ahead of the deadline.

===International co-operation===
The International Y2K Cooperation Center (IY2KCC) was established at the behest of national Y2K coordinators from over 120 countries when they met at the First Global Meeting of National Y2K Coordinators at the United Nations in December 1988. IY2KCC established an office in Washington, D.C. in March 1999. Funding was provided by the World Bank, and Bruce W. McConnell was appointed as director.

IY2KCC's mission was to "promote increased strategic cooperation and action among governments, peoples, and the private sector to minimize adverse Y2K effects on the global society and economy." Activities of IY2KCC were conducted in six areas:
* National Readiness: Promoting Y2K programs worldwide
* Regional Cooperation: Promoting and supporting co-ordination within defined geographic areas
* Sector Cooperation: Promoting and supporting co-ordination within and across defined economic sectors
* Continuity and Response Cooperation: Promoting and supporting co-ordination to ensure essential services and provisions for emergency response
* Information Cooperation: Promoting and supporting international information sharing and publicity
* Facilitation and Assistance: Organizing global meetings of Y2K coordinators and to identify resources

IY2KCC closed down in March 2000.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://purl.umn.edu/41469|title=Finding Aids at The University of Minnesota|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Private sector response==
* The United States established the ''Year 2000 Information and Readiness Disclosure Act'', which limited the liability of businesses who had properly disclosed their Y2K readiness.
* Insurance companies sold insurance policies covering failure of businesses due to Y2K problems.
* Attorneys organised and mobilised for Y2K class action lawsuits (which were not pursued).
* Survivalist-related businesses (gun dealers, surplus and sporting goods) anticipated increased business in the final months of 1999 in an event known as the '''Y2K scare'''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.quetek.com/dictionary/y2k-scare.html |title=quetek.com |publisher=quetek.com |accessdate=25 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* The [[Long Now Foundation]], which (in their words) "seeks to promote 'slower/better' thinking and to foster creativity in the framework of the next 10,000 years", has a policy of anticipating the [[Year 10,000 problem]] by writing all years with five digits. For example, they list "01996" as their year of founding.
* While there was no one comprehensive internet Y2K effort, multiple internet trade associations and organisations banded together to form the Internet Year 2000 Campaign.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cybertelecom.org/year2000/ Internet Year 2000 Campaign] archived at Cybertelecom.&lt;/ref&gt; This effort partnered with the White House's Internet Y2K Roundtable.

The Y2K issue was a major topic of discussion in the late 1990s and as such showed up in most popular media. A number of "Y2K disaster" books were published such as ''Deadline Y2K'' by Mark Joseph. Movies such as ''Y2K: Year to Kill'' capitalised on the currency of Y2K, as did numerous TV shows, comic strips, and computer games.

== Fringe group responses ==

A variety of fringe groups and individuals such as those within some [[fundamentalist]] religious organizations, [[survivalists]], [[cults]], anti-social movements, [[self-sufficiency]] enthusiasts, [[communes]] and those attracted to [[conspiracy theories]], embraced Y2K as a tool to engender fear and provide a form of evidence for their respective theories. [[End of the world (civilization)|End-of-the-world]] scenarios and [[Apocalypse|apocalyptic]] themes were common in their communication.

Interest in the survivalist movement peaked in 1999 in its second wave for that decade, triggered by Y2K fears. In the time before extensive efforts were made to rewrite computer programming codes to mitigate the possible impacts, some writers such as [[Gary North (economist)|Gary North]], [[Ed Yourdon]], [[James Howard Kunstler]],&lt;ref name="y2k2"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://kunstler.com/mags_y2k.html|title=My Y2K—A Personal Statement|accessdate=12 December 2006|publisher=Kunstler, Jim|year=1999|author=Kunstler, Jim}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Ed Yardeni anticipated widespread power outages, food and gasoline shortages, and other emergencies. North and others raised the alarm because they thought Y2K code fixes were not being made quickly enough. While a range of authors responded to this wave of concern, two of the most survival-focused texts to emerge were ''Boston on Y2K'' (1998) by [[Kenneth W. Royce]], and Mike Oehler's ''The Hippy Survival Guide to Y2K''.

Y2K was also exploited by some prominent and other lesser known fundamentalist and [[Pentecostal]] [[Christian]] leaders throughout the Western world, particularly in North America and Australia.&lt;ref name="au.org"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.au.org/church-state/february-2000-church-state/featured/false-prophets-real-profits|title=False Prophets, Real Profits - Americans United|publisher=|accessdate=9 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Their promotion of the perceived risks of Y2K was combined with [[end times]] thinking and [[Apocalypse|apocalyptic]] [[prophecies]] in an attempt to influence followers.&lt;ref name="au.org"/&gt; The ''[[New York Times]]'' reported in late 1999, "The Rev. [[Jerry Falwell]] suggested that Y2K would be the confirmation of Christian [[prophecy]] — God's instrument to shake this nation, to humble this nation. The Y2K crisis might incite a worldwide [[Revivalisms|revival]] that would lead to the [[rapture]] of the church. Along with many survivalists, Mr. Falwell advised stocking up on food and guns".&lt;ref&gt;Dutton, D., 31 December 2009 New York Times, "Its Always the End of the World as we Know it"&lt;/ref&gt; Adherents in these movements were encouraged to engage in food hoarding, take lessons in self-sufficiency, and the more extreme elements planned for a total collapse of modern society. The ''[[Chicago Tribune]]'' reported that some large fundamentalist churches, motivated by Y2K, were the sites for [[flea market]]-like sales of paraphernalia designed to help people survive a social order crisis ranging from gold coins to wood-burning stoves.&lt;ref&gt;Coen, J., 1 March 1999, "Some Christians Fear End, It's just a day to others" Chicago Tribune&lt;/ref&gt; [[Betsy Hart]], writing for the ''[[Deseret News]]'' reported that a lot of the more extreme evangelicals used Y2K to promote a political agenda in which downfall of the government was a desired outcome in order to usher in Christ's reign. She also noted that, "the cold truth is that preaching chaos is profitable and calm doesn't sell many tapes or books"&lt;ref&gt;Hart, B., 12 February 1999 Deseret News, "Christian Y2K Alarmists Irresponsible" Scripps Howard News Service&lt;/ref&gt; These types of fears and conspiracies were described dramatically by New Zealand-based Christian prophetic author and preacher [[Barry Smith (preacher)|Barry Smith]] in his publication, "I Spy with my Little Eye", where he dedicated a whole chapter to Y2K.&lt;ref&gt;Smith, B., 1999, I Spy with my Little Eye, MS Life Media, chapter 24 - Y2K Bug, http://www.barrysmith.org.nz/site/books/&lt;/ref&gt; Some expected, at times through so-called prophecies, that Y2K would be the beginning of a worldwide Christian revival.&lt;ref name="colstringer.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.colstringer.com/information/newsletters/vol-1-no-4.html|title=Col Stringer Ministries - Newsletter Vol.1 : No.4|publisher=|accessdate=9 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It became clear in the aftermath that leaders of these fringe groups had cleverly used fears of apocalyptic outcomes to manipulate followers into dramatic scenes of mass repentance or renewed commitment to their groups, additional giving of funds and more overt commitment to their respective organizations or churches. The ''[[Baltimore Sun]]'' noted this in their article, "Apocalypse Now — Y2K spurs fears", where they reported the increased call for repentance in the populace in order to avoid God's wrath.&lt;ref&gt;Rivera, J., 17 February 1999, "Apocalypse Now – Y2K spurs fears", Baltimore sun&lt;/ref&gt; Christian leader, [[Col Stringer]], in his commentary has published, "Fear-creating writers sold over 45 million books citing every conceivable catastrophe from civil war, planes dropping from the sky to the end of the civilised world as we know it. Reputable preachers were advocating food storage and a "head for the caves" mentality. No banks failed, no planes crashed, no wars or civil war started. And yet not one of these prophets of doom has ever apologised for their scare-mongering tactics."&lt;ref name="colstringer.com"/&gt; Some prominent North American Christian ministries and leaders generated huge personal and corporate profits through sales of Y2K preparation kits, generators, survival guides, published prophecies and a wide range of other associated merchandise. Christian journalist, [[Rob Boston]], has documented this&lt;ref name="au.org"/&gt; in his article "False Prophets, Real Profits — Religious Right Leaders' Wild Predictions of Y2K Disaster Didn't Come True, But They Made Money Anyway".

==Cost==
The total cost of the work done in preparation for Y2K is estimated at over US$300 billion (${{Inflation|US|300|2000}} billion as of January 2018, once inflation is taken into account).{{inflation-fn|US}}&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/talking_point/586938.stm Y2K: Overhyped and oversold?], report from [[BBC News]], 6 January 2000.&lt;/ref&gt; IDC calculated that the US spent an estimated $134 billion (${{Inflation|US|134|2000}} billion) preparing for Y2K, and another $13 billion (${{Inflation|US|13|2000}} billion) fixing problems in 2000 and 2001. Worldwide, $308 billion (${{Inflation|US|308|2000}} billion) was estimated to have been spent on Y2K remediation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.computerworld.com/s/article/9142555/Y2K_The_good_the_bad_and_the_crazy?taxonomyId=14&amp;pageNumber=2|title=Y2K: The good, the bad and the crazy|date=28 December 2009|author=Robert L. Mitchell|publisher=ComputerWorld}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are two ways to view the events of 2000 from the perspective of its aftermath:

===Supporting view===
This view holds that the vast majority of problems had been fixed correctly, and the money was well spent. The situation was essentially one of preemptive alarm. Those who hold this view claim that the lack of problems at the date change reflects the completeness of the project, and that many computer applications would not have continued to function into the 21st century without correction or remediation.
* Expected problems that were not seen by small businesses and small organisations were in fact prevented by Y2K fixes embedded in routine updates to operating system and utility software that were applied several years before 31 December 1999.
* The extent to which larger industry and government fixes averted issues that would have more significant impacts had they not been fixed, were typically not disclosed or widely reported.&lt;ref name="claro"&gt;[https://clarotesting.wordpress.com/2015/01/12/y2k-why-i-know-it-was-a-real-problem/ James Christie, (12 January 2015), Y2K – why I know it was a real problem, 'Claro Testing Blog'] (accessed 12 January 2015){{unreliable source? |date=January 2015 |reason=This is a blog and the author is not a recognized Y2K expert.}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* It has also been suggested that on [[September 11 attacks|11 September 2001]], the New York infrastructure (including subways, phone service, and financial transactions) was able to continue operation because of the redundant networks established in the event of Y2K bug impact&lt;ref&gt;[http://web.mit.edu/newsoffice/2002/terror-1120.html Y2K readiness helped New York after 9/11], article by Lois Slavin of [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology|MIT]] News, 20 November 2002.&lt;/ref&gt; and the contingency plans devised by companies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.imf.org/external/pubs/ft/fandd/2002/03/cumming.htm|title=Finance &amp; Development, March 2002 - September 11 and the U.S. Payment System|work=Finance and Development - F&amp;D}}&lt;/ref&gt; The terrorist attacks and the following prolonged blackout to lower Manhattan had minimal effect on global banking systems.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=ig0AAAAAMBAJ&amp;lpg=PA38&amp;ots=vDkR0Xg_t0&amp;dq=y2k%209%2F11%20blackout%20banking&amp;pg=PP1#v=onepage&amp;q=y2k%209/11%20blackout%20banking&amp;f=false|title= The Next Time the Lights Go Out|last= Goldberg|first= Michael|last2= Carr|first2= Kathleen|date= 13 October 2003|publisher= CIO Magazine}}&lt;/ref&gt; Backup systems were activated at various locations around the region, many of which had been established to deal with a possible complete failure of networks in the financial district on 31 December 1999.&lt;ref&gt;[http://web.mit.edu/newsoffice/2002/terror.html Y2K readiness helped NYC on 9/11], article by Rae Zimmerman of [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology|MIT News]], 19 November 2002.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Opposing view===
The contrary view asserts that there were no, or very few, critical problems to begin with. This view also asserts that there would have been only a few minor mistakes and that a "fix on failure" approach would have been the most efficient and [[cost-effective]] way to solve these problems as they occurred. 
* Countries such as South Korea and Italy invested little to nothing in Y2K remediation,&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url= https://www.nytimes.com/2010/01/01/opinion/01dutton.html?_r=0 |title= It’s Always the End of the World as We Know It |first= Denis |last= Dutton |authorlink= Denis Dutton |date= 31 December 2009 |newspaper= [[The New York Times]]}}.&lt;/ref&gt; yet had the same negligible Y2K problems as countries that spent enormous sums of money.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url= https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/WPcap/2000-01/04/035r-010400-idx.html |title= Italy Swatted the Y2K Bug |first= R.

* The lack of Y2K-related problems in schools, many of which undertook little or no remediation effort. By 1 September 1999, only 28% of US schools had achieved compliance for mission critical systems, and a government report predicted that "Y2K failures could very well plague the computers used by schools to manage payrolls, student records, online curricula, and building safety systems".&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20060506133440/http://eschoolnews.com/news/showstory.cfm?ArticleID=404 White House: Schools lag in Y2K readiness: President's Council sounds alarm over K-12 districts' preparations so far], article by Jonathan Levine of ''eSchool News'', 1 September 1999.&lt;/ref&gt;
* The lack of Y2K-related problems in an estimated 1.5 million small businesses that undertook no remediation effort. On 3 January 2000 (the first weekday of the year), the Small Business Administration received an estimated 40 calls from businesses with computer problems, similar to the average. None of the problems were critical.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url= http://www.bizjournals.com/seattle/stories/2000/01/10/newscolumn5.html?page=all |title= Most small businesses win their Y2K gamble |first= Kent |last= Hoover |date= 9 January 2000 |newspaper= [[Puget Sound Business Journal]]}}.&lt;/ref&gt;
* The absence of Y2K-related problems occurring before 1 January 2000, even though the 2000 financial year commenced in 1999 in many jurisdictions, and a wide range of forward-looking calculations involved dates in 2000 and later years.

Y2K appears safe], article by Elizabeth Weise of ''[[USA Today]]'', 14 February 1999.&lt;/ref&gt; Critics of large-scale remediation argued during 1999 that the absence of significant reported problems in non-compliant small firms was evidence that there had been, and would be, no serious problems needing to be fixed in ''any'' firm, and that the scale of the problem had therefore been severely overestimated.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20080524084926/http://www.uq.edu.au/economics/johnquiggin/news/Millennium9908.html John Quiggin, (2 September 1999), Y2K bug may never bite, 'Australian Financial Review'] (from The Internet Archive accessed 29 December 2009).&lt;/ref&gt; However, this can be countered with the observation that large companies had significant problems requiring action, that Y2K programmers were fully aware of the variable timescale, and that they were working to a series of earlier target dates, rather than a single fixed target of 31 December 1999.&lt;ref name="claro" /&gt;
