The '''19 June 1857 law''', also called ''loi relative à l'assainissement et de mise en culture des Landes de Gascogne'' (Law related to sanitation and culture of the Gascogne landes), is a turning point in the [[Landes forest|Landes]] history: it is the end of traditional [[pastoralism]], the disappearance of the Landes shepherd, and the beginning of the extension of the [[Landes forest]] on the major part of the territory, leading to the generalization of [[resin extraction]] in the region.

During and immediately post the second world war, the [[Netherlands East Indies]] government in exile, was stationed in [[Wacol]], Queensland, and the [[Netherlands Indies Government Information Service]] in Melbourne, with the agreement of the then Labor Australian government. Australia was planned as the staging post for re-imposition of colonial rule in [[Indonesia]]. However, Australian maritime unions did much to frustrate this, with bans on manning/loading/coaling from September 1946 to a final ending of all bans in July 1949.&lt;ref name=ba&gt;Lockwood, R.

'''Chadian literature''' has suffered greatly from the turmoil which has engulfed [[Chad|the country]], [[Economy of Chad|economical]] and [[Politics of Chad|political]]. As with many cultures, literature in Chad began with [[Folklore|folk tales]] and [[legend]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |last= |first= |title=Chadian Literature |url=http://www.tchad.org/research/literature.html |accessdate=2007-09-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; While [[French language|French]] is the dominant language, [[Arabic language|Arabic]] is also used by some Chadian writers. Chadian literature is more prevalent in [[France]] than in Chad itself, due to [[market demand]] and the repressive culture present in Chad.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |last=Abbink |first=Jon G. |title=Culture of Chad |url=http://www.everyculture.com/Bo-Co/Chad.html |accessdate=2007-09-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Chad's only literary critic, [[Ahmat Taboye]], wrote ''[[Anthologie de la littérature tchadienne]]'' in 2003 to spread knowledge of Chadian literature. Though there are not very many well-known Chadian writers, there are a few, including [[Joseph Brahim Seïd]], [[Baba Moustapha]], [[Antoine Bangui]] and [[Koulsy Lamko]].

[[File:Charles Grimaldi de Monaco.jpg|thumb|right|Charles I of Monaco]]
'''Charles I of Monaco''' (died August 15, 1357) was Lord of Monaco and the founder of the Grimaldi dynasty. 

The oldest son of [[Rainier I of Monaco|Rainier I]] by his first wife, [[Salvatica del Carretto]], Charles was forced to flee into exile following the [[Rock of Monaco]] falling into [[Republic of Genoa|Genoese]] control on April 10, 1301.

He was appointed [[Admiral of France]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://cloud.gouv.mc/webweb/Annuoff.nsf/(ListCh)/B7433860E52C08F9C12567C20033DFD7!OpenDocument Cloud]&lt;/ref&gt;

After thirty years of Genoese rule, Charles retook the Rock on September 12, 1331, and ruled to his death, when the Rock was again conquered by the Genoese army. 

Also he was Baron of San Demetrio ([[Kingdom of Naples]]).&lt;ref&gt;[http://cloud.gouv.mc/webweb/Annuoff.nsf/(ListCh)/B7433860E52C08F9C12567C20033DFD7!OpenDocument Cloud]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1346 he took the Lordship of [[Menton]] and, in 1355, he conquered the Lordship of [[Roquebrune-Cap-Martin|Roquebrune]].

On June 29, 1352, Charles designed a co-rulership of Monaco between his uncle [[Antonio, Lord of Monaco|Antonio]] (his father's youngest brother), and his own sons, [[Rainier II, Lord of Monaco|Rainier II]] and [[Gabriele, Lord of Monaco|Gabriele]].

==Family==
Charles I married '''[[Lucchina Spinola]]''', a daughter of [[Girardo Spinola]], Lord of Dertonne. They had eight children:

*[[Louis, Lord of Monaco|Louis]], his successor.
*[[Rainier II, Lord of Monaco|Rainier II]]
*Francesco
*[[Gabriele, Lord of Monaco|Gabriele]], married to a member of the [[Orsini family]]
*Charles, Co-Lord of Mentone; he had a son, Luca, who inherited Mentone. Luca had two sons, Pietro and Filippo, also Lords of Mentone; both brothers died without issue, and Mentone passed to the older branch of the family.
*Lancelot
*Ruffo
*Anastasia

The '''Dabene Treasure''' ({{lang-bg|Дъбенското съкровище}}) was unearthed in 2004 near the village of [[Dabene]] in the municipality of [[Karlovo]], [[Plovdiv Province]], central [[Bulgaria]]. The excavations were led by the archaeologist Martin Hristov. Other elements of the treasure were discovered in 2006. 

The excavations in the area began after two archaeologists from the [[National Historical Museum (Bulgaria)|National Historical Museum]] met a local woman with an exquisite golden necklace found by her husband while ploughing with his tractor. The couple was unaware of the origins of the jewel and cooperated with the archaeologists.

The whole treasure consists of 15,000 golden elements. The most important of them was a dagger made of [[gold]] and [[platinum]] with an unusual edge. The treasure was dated to 2000 B.C. The scientists suggest that the [[Karlovo]] valley where Dabene is located used to be a major crafts center which exported golden jewelry all over Europe. That conclusion was made because the golden elements were not discovered in a burial mound and there are no remains of bones or ceramics and therefore the elements were not burial gifts.

The treasure was unearthed in perfect condition and was exhibited in the [[National Historical Museum (Bulgaria)|National Historical Museum]] without restoration on 9 August 2009.

'''Dalmatian city-states''' were the [[Dalmatia|Dalmatian]] localities where the local [[Romance languages|Romance]] population survived the [[Barbarian invasions]] after the fall of the [[Western Roman Empire]] in the 400s CE. Eight little cities were created by those autochthonous inhabitants that maintained political links with the [[Byzantine Empire]] (that defended these cities allowing their commerce).&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.org/stream/dalmatiaquarnero01jackuoft#page/14/mode/2up  Thomas Jackson: Recovery of Roman municipalities. p. 14-16]&lt;/ref&gt; The original name of the cities was ''Jadera, Spalatum, Crespa, Arba, Tragurium, Vecla, Ragusium'' and ''Cattarum''. The language and the laws where initially [[Latin]], but after a few centuries they developed their own neo-Latin language (the "[[Dalmatian language|Dalmatico]]"), that lasted until the 19th century. The cities were maritime centres with a huge commerce mainly with the Italian peninsula and with the growing [[Republic of Venice]].

==History==
Dalmatia after the fall of the [[Roman Empire]] consisted of a group of autochthonous coastal cities functioning much like city-states, with extensive autonomy, but without control of the rural hinterland controlled by the Slavic tribes who arrived after 640 AD.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=JNMOAAAAQAAJ&amp;pg=RA1-PA4&amp;dq=dalmazia+citta+stato&amp;hl=it&amp;source=gbs_selected_pages&amp;cad=2#v=onepage&amp;q=dalmazia%20citta%20stato&amp;f=false Giovanni Cattalinich. "Storia della Dalmazia" V chapter]&lt;/ref&gt;

Ethnically, Dalmatia started out as a Roman region, with a romance culture that began to develop independently, forming the now-extinct Dalmatian language called "Dalmatico". So, these cities were characterized by common Latin laws, Catholic religion, the same romance language, common commerce and same political/administrative structures and entities.

The eight City-states were:
* ''Jadera'', later called "Zara" in Italian and "Zadar" in Croatian. Originally a small island in the central Dalmatia coast

{{History of Dalmatia}}
{{Quote|''The great Slavonic migration into Illyria, which wrought a complete change in the fortunes of Dalmatia, took place in the first half of the 7th century. In other parts of the Balkan Peninsula these invaders Serbs, Croats or Bulgars found little difficulty in expelling or absorbing the native population. But here they were baffled when confronted by the powerful maritime city-states, highly civilized, and able to rely on the moral if not the material support of their kinsfolk in Italy. Consequently, while the country districts were settled by the Slavs, the Latin or Italian population flocked for safety to Ragusa, Zara and other large towns, and the whole country was thus divided between two frequently hostile communities. This opposition was intensified by the schism between Eastern and Western Christianity (1054), the Slavs as a rule preferring the Orthodox or sometimes the Bogomil creed, while the Italians were firmly attached to the Papacy. Not until the isth century did the rival races contribute to a common civilization in the literature of Ragusa. To such a division of population may be attributed the two dominant characteristics of local history the total absence of national as distinguished from civic life, and the remarkable development of art, science and literature. Bosnia, Servia and Bulgaria had each its period of national greatness, but remained intellectually backward; Dalmatia failed ever to attain political or racial unity, but the Dalmatian city-states, isolated and compelled to look to Italy for support, shared perforce in the march of Italian civilization. Their geographical position suffices to explain the relatively small influence exercised by Byzantine culture throughout the six centuries (535-1102) during which Dalmatia was part of the Eastern empire. Towards the close of this period Byzantine rule tended more and more to become merely nominal''.&lt;ref&gt;1911 Encyclopædia Britannica, p.774&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Indeed, in the [[Early Middle ages|Early Medieval period]], Byzantine Dalmatia was ravaged by an [[Avars (Carpathians)|Avar]] invasion that destroyed its capital, [[Salona]], in 639 AD, an event that allowed for the settlement of the nearby [[Diocletian's Palace]] in [[Spalatum]] by Salonitans, greatly increasing the importance of the city. The Avars were followed by the great [[South Slavs|South Slavic]] migrations.&lt;ref&gt;Curta Florin. "Southwestern Europe in the Middle Ages, 500-1250". Introduction&lt;/ref&gt;

The Slavs, loosely allied with the Avars, permanently settled the region in the first half of the 7th century AD and remained its predominant ethnic group ever since. The [[Croats]] soon formed their own realm: the [[Principality of Dalmatian Croatia]] ruled by native Princes of [[Guduscani|Guduscan]] origin. The meaning of the geographical term "Dalmatia", now shrunk to the cities and their immediate hinterland. These cities and towns remained influential as they were well fortified and maintained their connection with the [[Byzantine Empire]]. The two communities were somewhat hostile at first, but as the Croats became [[Christianized]] this tension increasingly subsided. A degree of cultural mingling soon took place, in some enclaves stronger, in others weaker, as Slavic influence and culture was more accentuated in [[Dubrovnik|Ragusium]] and [[Kotor|Cattarum]] while the influence from the Italian peninsula was stronger in the northern Dalmatia islands and in [[Zadar|Jadera]] and [[Split, Croatia|Spalatum]].

Around 950 AD as the Dalmatian city states gradually lost all protection by [[Byzantium]], being unable to unite in a defensive league hindered by their internal dissensions, they had to turn to [[Republic of Venice|Venice]] for support. Each of the Dalmatian city states needed protection (even from Narentane [[piracy]]), based mostly on economic reasons. In the year 1000 AD an expedition of Venetian ships in coastal Istria and Dalmatia secured the Venetian suzerainty in the area, and the [[Narentines]], Slav pirates, were suppressed permanently. In the occasion [[Pietro II Orseolo|Doge Orseolo]] named himself "Duke of Dalmatia", starting the [[Stato da Mar|colonial Empire of Venice]].

The Venetians, to whom the Dalmatians were already bound by language and culture, could afford to concede liberal terms as its main goal was to prevent the development of any dangerous political or commercial competitor on the eastern Adriatic. The seafaring community in Dalmatia looked to Venice as the new "queen" of the [[Adriatic sea]]. In return for protection, these 8 "neolatin" cities often furnished a contingent to the army or navy of their suzerain, and sometimes paid tribute either in money or in kind. Arbe (actual [[Rab]]), for example, annually paid ten pounds of silk or five pounds of gold to Venice. The Dalmatian cities might elect their own chief magistrate, bishop and judges; their Roman law remained valid and they were even permitted to conclude separate alliances.

In these centuries started to disappear the Dalmatian language, that was assimilated by the venetian dialect.Dalmatian was spoken on the Dalmatian coast from Fiume (now [[Rijeka]]) as far south as Cottorum ([[Kotor]]) in Montenegro. Speakers lived mainly in the coastal towns of Jadera ([[Zadar]]), Tragurium ([[Trogir]]), Spalatum&lt;ref&gt;[http://hrcak.srce.hr/index.php?show=clanak&amp;id_clanak_jezik=12100 Colloquia Maruliana, Vol. 12 Travanj 2003.] Zarko Muljacic — On the Dalmato-Romance in Marulić's Works (hrcak.srce.hr). Spalatum Romance (''Spalatin'') is studied by the author. Zarko Muljacic has set off in the only way possible, the indirect way of attempting to trace the secrets of its historical phonology by analysing any lexemes of possible Dalmato-Romance origin that have been preserved in [[Marko Marulić|Marulić]]'s [[Croatian language|Croatian]] works.&lt;/ref&gt; ([[Split, Croatia|Split]]), Ragusium ([[Dubrovnik]])  and also on the islands of Curicta ([[Krk]]), Crepsa ([[Cres]]) and Arba ([[Rab]]). Almost every city developed its own dialect, but the most important dialects we know of were ''Vegliot'', a northern dialect spoken on the island of Curicta, and ''Ragusan'', a southern dialect spoken in and around Ragusa ([[Dubrovnik]]).

The cities of Jadera, Spalatum, Tragurium and Ragusium and the surrounding territories each changed hands several times between Venice, [[Hungary]] and the Byzantium during the 12th century. In 1202, the armies of the [[Fourth Crusade]] rendered assistance to Venice by occupying Jadera, that started to be officially called ''Zara''. In 1204 the same army conquered Byzantium and finally eliminated the Eastern Empire from the list of contenders on Dalmatian territory.

The late 13th century was marked by a decline in external hostilities. The Dalmatian cities started accepting complete foreign sovereignty, mainly the one of the [[Republic of Venice]]. The only exception was Ragusium, that remained independent creating the [[Republic of Ragusa]] that lasted until the 1807 [[Napoleon]] conquest.

From 1420 started the venetian domination of the other seven of the original Dalmatian City-States, that were fully integrated in the venetian (and Italian) society of the [[Italian Renaissance]]. Zara become the capital of [[Venetian Dalmatia]] - as part of the [[Stato da Mar]]- until the 1797 end of the Republic of Venice and in the next centuries the city was the main center of the [[Dalmatian Italians]].

The last speaker of any Dalmatian dialect of the Dalmatian City-States was [[Tuone Udaina]] ({{lang-it|Antonio Udina}}), who was accidentally killed in an explosion on June 10, 1898 in the island of Veglia (actual [[Krk]])&lt;ref name="Roegiest"&gt;{{cite book |author=Eugeen Roegiest |title=Vers les sources des langues romanes: un itinéraire linguistique à travers la Romania |publisher=ACCO |year=2006 |page=138 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=hMdz09HGd8kC&amp;pg=PA138 |isbn=90-334-6094-7 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  With him disappeared the last vestige of the Dalmatian neolatin cities.&lt;ref name="Brahms"&gt;{{cite book |author=William B Brahms |title=Notable Last Facts: A Compendium of Endings, Conclusions, Terminations and Final Events throughout History |publisher=Reference Desk Press |year=2005 |location=Original from the [[University of Michigan]] |page=183 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=wIwYAAAAIAAJ |isbn=978-0-9765325-0-7 }}&lt;/ref&gt; His language &lt;ref&gt;[http://istro-romanian.com/documents/1899-1900_vassilich_archeo-triestino.pdf Romance languages in Istria and Dalmatia (in ancient Italian)]&lt;/ref&gt; was studied by the scholar [[Matteo Bartoli]], himself a native of nearby [[Istria]], who visited him in 1897 and wrote down approximately 2,800 words, stories, and accounts of his life, which were published in a book that has provided much information on the vocabulary, phonology, and grammar of the language. Bartoli wrote in Italian and published a translation in German (''{{lang|de|Das Dalmatische}}'') in 1906: this book is considered the first on ethnic minority disappearance in world literature.

==Dalmatian Pale==
The boundaries of the eight original Dalmatian City-States were defined by the so-called ''Dalmatian Pale'', similar to the one existing in Ireland under British control and called [[The Pale]]. The word ''pale'' derives ultimately from the Latin word ''palus'', meaning stake, specifically a stake used to support a fence.&lt;ref&gt;"Palus". Webster's Revised Unabridged Dictionary. MICRA, Inc.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''[[Palisade]]'' is derived from the same root.&lt;/ref&gt; From this came the figurative meaning of ''boundary'' and eventually the phrase ''[[Wiktionary:beyond the pale|beyond the pale]]'', as something outside the boundary. The term was used not only for the "Pale" in Ireland and in Dalmatia but also for various other English colonial settlements, notably [[Pale of Calais]], and later for the [[Jewish Pale]] in Russia.

Historian [[Johannes Lucius]] added to the "Dalmatia Pale" (somewhat similar to the "English Pale" in Ireland, as boundary of Roman local laws) of these Dalmatian City-States even Fiume (actual [[Rijeka]]) and Sebenico (actual [[Sibenik]]), after the year 1000 when Venice started to take control of the region.

Indeed, Fiume was the former Roman ''Tarsatica'': the city of that medieval period was a small fortified town under the Italian [[Aquileia]] (and Pola) bishops, enclosed within the town walls which had several defense towers. The town, called Flumen, was granted autonomy in the 11th century by the bishop and was divided into two parts: in the upper part, there was a medieval castle/[[Trsat Castle|formerly Roman fort]] and the church of [[St. Vitus]] (thus the name 'Flumen Sancti Viti'), while in the lower part - the popular- there was a commercial and trading center where around the year 1000 many Italian merchants settled.
[[File:+Sebenico by Martin Rota.jpg|thumb|right|250px|16th-century map of Sebenicum]]
Sebenicum was the ancient Roman city of ''Burnum'' &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.anvgd.it/rassegna-stampa/6057-sebenico-torna-alla-luce-antico-insediamento-romano-il-piccolo-21-lug Sibenik: Rediscovery of Burnum (in Italian)]&lt;/ref&gt; destroyed by the Avars and rebuilt in the 9th century by the Croats. [[Pope Boniface VIII]] signed in 1298 a "[[Papal bull|bolla]]" that declared a bishop for the town, that so was to be a "Free City" from the local [[Ban of Croatia|Ban]] [[Paul I Šubić of Bribir]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.istriadalmazia.it/turismo/SEBENICO.pdf History of Sibenik]&lt;/ref&gt;

Furthermore, about ''Sebenico'' Thomas Jackson &lt;ref&gt;Thomas Jackson, ''Dalmatia, the Quarnero and Istria''. 1887&lt;/ref&gt; wrote that:

{{Quote|''In 1167 Stephen III raised Sebenico to the rank of a 'free city' conferring on it a charter and privileges similar to those enjoyed by the old Dalmatian cities of Trau and Spalato, and from that time forward Sebenico must be reckoned as within the 'Dalmatian Pale', though a Croatian town by descent and tradition. Lucio says the Sebenzani were some time in learning to wear their new privileges easily; accustomed for so long to be governed despotically, they accommodated themselves with difficulty to the Dalmatian (latin) laws; they had Counts appointed for life, and not for a short term like the other cities, who were with difficulty restrained from their old habits of piracy, and they were more exposed than the other cities to the arbitrary interference of the Ban. Gradually however the Sebenzani became Latinized, and in later ages the city was described by [[Alberto Fortis|Fortis]] as next to Zara the best built in Dalmatia, and inhabited by the greatest number of noble families, as far removed from the barbarous manners of ancient pirates as their houses are unlike the former cottages or sibice; and the same writer tells us that in the sixteenth century the arts and sciences flourished in this city more than in any other of Dalmatia''.}}

Lucius wrote even that ''Pagus'' (the Venetian Pago, actually called [[Pag (town)|Pag]]) had municipal autonomy virtually independent for centuries around the year 1000. In 1244 the Hungarian [[Béla IV of Hungary|King Béla IV]] named it a "Free royal city" and in 1376 [[Louis I of Hungary]] granted it autonomy. In 1409, Pago, together with the whole island, passed permanently to the Republic of Venice and had reconfirmed their communal autonomy guaranteed by a board of 50 civic local aristocratic families (this board was created in 1451).

'''Dish México, S. de R. L. de C.V.''' (In Mexico: ''Alcanzca'') is a Mexican-owned company that operates a subscription satellite television service in [[México]] nationwide.&lt;ref&gt;''Expansión'' Volume 40, Page 18 2009 "Gisela Vázquez, DISH México – La competencia en televisión satelital llegará a la Ciudad de México en las próximas semanas cuando Dish México inicie operaciones en el mayor mercado del país.

L. de C.V., stands for Sociedad de Responsabilidad Limitada de Capital Variable, a form of [[limited company]]. It is owned by [[MVS Comunicaciones]] 51% and [[Dish Network Corporation]] 49%.

==History==
On 1 December 2008, Dish México began to operate in México, after an agreement between [[Dish Network Corporation]] and the Mexican media conglomerate [[MVS Comunicaciones]]. Dish Network owns 49% and MVS owns 51% of Dish México. On January 2011, Dish México added six HD channels [[TNT (U.S. TV network)|TNT]], [[Space (Latin American TV channel)|Space]], [[Fox Sports en Español]], [[History (U.S. TV channel)|History Channel]], [[Universal Channel]] and [[Sony Entertainment Television]]. On April 2011 Dish México added three new channels: [[Fox Latin America|Fox]], [[National Geographic Channel|Nat Geo]], and [[Nat Geo Wild]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dish.com.mx/ Dish México]&lt;/ref&gt; All of Dish México's channels programming are dubbed or subtitled in Spanish or originally Spanish language.

===Broadcast networks===
Dish México could not transmit [[Televisa]] or [[Azteca (multimedia conglomerate)|TV Azteca]] network locals due to a dispute between Dish México and Televisa. The fight was produced when Televisa wanted to charge Dish México per subscriber for its feeds of free over-the-air Televisa network channels; including some restricted channel. Dish México decided to distribute an HD receiver with a terrestrial antenna input which when connected to an over the air antenna picks up [[digital television|digital]] local stations signals free of charge.
On June 16, 2013, Dish showed a TV commercial where they announced that it would add the national free-to-air television channels, including Televisa ([[Las Estrellas]], [[Canal 5 (Televisa Network)|Canal 5]] and [[Gala TV (Mexico)|Gala TV]]) and TV Azteca ([[Azteca 7]] and [[Azteca Trece]]), thanks to the telecommunications reform enacted on June 2013, in which all satellite TV companies are forced to transmit television signals that have 50 percent coverage national territory or more.&lt;ref&gt;[http://aristeguinoticias.com/1606/mexico/dish-ofrecera-senal-de-televisa-y-tv-azteca-por-reforma-de-telecom/ Dish ofrecerá señal de Televisa y Tv Azteca]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jornada.unam.mx/2013/06/17/economia/017n4eco Dish ofrecerá canales de Tv Azteca y Televisa]&lt;/ref&gt; The broadcast of these channels was made official since September 11, 2013.

{{Politics of Djibouti}}

'''Parliamentary elections''' were held in [[Djibouti]] on 22 February 2013.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.africaintelligence.com/ION/politics-power/2012/10/06/iog-takes-risk-of-renewing-rpp-top-brass,107917811-EVE IOG takes risk of renewing RPP top brass] Africa Intelligence, 6 October 2012&lt;/ref&gt; After their boycott of the [[Djiboutian parliamentary election, 2008|2008 elections]], opposition groups contested the elections as the Union for National Safety alliance.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.theaustralian.com.au/news/breaking-news/djibouti-regime-facing-tough-poll/story-fn3dxix6-1226582922306 Djibouti regime facing tough poll] The Australian, 21 February 2013&lt;/ref&gt; 

According to government figures, the ruling [[Union for the Presidential Majority (Djibouti)|Union for the Presidential Majority]] won 55 of 65 seats in Parliament. However, the opposition claimed the figures for [[Djibouti (city)|Djibouti city]] were falsified and released alternative results which would have reduced the UMP to 34 seats and increased their total from 10 to 31.

==Electoral system==
In 2013 the previous winner-takes-all party block vote was abandoned. Instead the elections were held using [[closed list]] systems in which 80% of seats (rounded to the nearest integer) in each constituency were awarded to the party receiving the most votes. The remaining seats were allocated proportionally to other parties receiving over 10% of the vote using the [[D'Hondt method]]. In cases where no other party received more than 10% of the vote, all seats in a constituency were awarded to the party receiving the most votes.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.presidence.dj/PresidenceOld/jo/2012/loiorg16an12.php The 2012 amendment to art. 33 of the electoral law] President of Djibouti&lt;/ref&gt;

==Aftermath==
On 26 February 2013, UNS spokesman Daher Ahmed Farah said police fired tear gas on demonstrators that were protesting the election results. 300 people were arrested. "The situation is tense," Farah said. "The opposition won the elections and the victory was denied... the numbers were manipulated."&lt;ref&gt;http://www.middle-east-online.com/english/?id=57197&lt;/ref&gt; The National Assembly began meeting for its new parliamentary term on 18 March 2013.

This article deals with the history and evolution of Sub-Saharans and Eastern Eurasians in Europe.

==DNA==

===Y-DNA===

In Europe, African Y-DNA chromosomes (which are defined as A, B and sub-Saharan variants of the Eurasian E) are consistently found at frequencies of less than 1% (with the exception of Portugal which may have up to 3% African Y-DNA).&lt;ref&gt;https://scholar.google.com/scholar?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;cluster=11056732165607900434&amp;um=1&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;ei=F7DvSoyoMommNp2jwIoH&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=science_links&amp;resnum=1&amp;ct=sl-allversions&amp;ved=0CAoQ0AIwAA&lt;/ref&gt;
It is a somewhat controversial issue over what an African Y-DNA [[haplogroup]] is, because some [[Eurasia]]n haplogroups such as haplogroup J, E3b, and even haplogroup R (particularly R1B) are often incorrectly labeled as being African because they can be consistently found at a high frequency in the Afro-Asiatic speakers that live in Africa.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.jogg.info/11/coffman.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://hpgl.stanford.edu/publications/AJHG_2002_v70_p1197-1214.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; Genetic studies disprove this for example Haplogroup E3B has been proven by science to have begun in the Near East.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://genographic.nationalgeographic.com/genographic/lan/en/atlas.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-03-31 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110205224742/https://genographic.nationalgeographic.com/genographic/lan/en/atlas.html |archivedate=2011-02-05 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Mtdna===

African mtDNA (Haplogroup L which is genetically isolated) is rare in Europe although much more common than African Y-DNA.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.promega.com/Catalog/CountrySelect.aspx?returnurl=/geneticidproc/ussymp6proc/antti.htm&lt;/ref&gt; It is most common in Portugal where 5% of people have it, though outside of Portugal it quite rare (consistently lower than 1%).  For example, its frequencies run at 0.7% in Finland, 0.4%  in Spain, and 0.1% in Ireland.&lt;ref&gt;Rhouda et al&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|pmc=1852723 | pmid=17357081 | doi=10.1086/512822 | volume=80 | issue=4 | title=Mitochondrial DNA variation of modern Tuscans supports the near eastern origin of Etruscans |date=April 2007 | journal=American Journal of Human Genetics| pages=759–68}}&lt;/ref&gt; As in Y-DNA many Caucasian mtDNA haplogroups (such as U6 and H1) and also some Eurasian mtDNA haplogroups such as (M1) are often wrongly described as African; probably because they can be found at high frequencies in the Afro-Eurasian speakers who also have a high consistency of Caucasian Y-DNA haplogroups.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|pmc=1945034 | pmid=17620140 | doi=10.1186/1471-2164-8-223 | volume=8 | title=Mitochondrial lineage M1 traces an early human backflow to Africa | year=2007 | journal=BMC Genomics | pages=223}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==

=== Early history ===
The early history of Eastern Eurasian and African interactions with Europe can be found by the genetics of contemporary European populations. Both populations seem to have had little influence on Europe. Less than 1% of Europeans (including Spaniards) have African y-dna or mtDNA.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;Y-Chromosomal Diversity in Europe Is Clinal and Influenced Primarily by Geography, Rather than by Language&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Determination genétique de l’individu Néolithique de Segudet (Ordino), les restes humains les plus anciens d’Andorre&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Geographic Patterns of mtDNA Diversity in Europe&lt;/ref&gt;

Eastern Eurasian dna is much more common and is represented mostly by the presence of haplogroup N3 in far north east Europe.&lt;ref name="nature.com"&gt;http://www.nature.com/ejhg/journal/v15/n2/abs/5201748a.html&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="nature.com"/&gt; Many African populations have a large proportion of western Eurasian DNA particularly north Africa which is about 90% western Eurasian &lt;ref&gt;Worldwide human relationships inferred from genome-wide patterns of variation&lt;/ref&gt; the above study is confirmed by y-dna and mtDNA analysis of north Africa for example over 90% of north African men belong to  the western Eurasian E3B,J,G, or R1 haplogroups &lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; In sub-Saharan Africa amounts of western Eurasian DNA can be found in speakers of the afro-Asiatic language branch.

{{taxation}}

'''James R. Hines Jr.''' (born 9 July 1958) is an American [[economist]] and a founder of academic research into corporate-focused [[tax havens]], and the effect of U.S. corporate tax policy on the behaviors of U.S. multinationals.  His papers were some of the first to analyse ''[[base erosion and profit shifting|profit shifting]]'', and to establish quantitative features of [[tax havens]]. Hines showed that being a tax haven could be a prosperous strategy for a jurisdiction, and controversially, that tax havens can promote economic growth.  Hines showed that use of tax havens by U.S. multinationals had maximized long-term U.S. exchequer tax receipts, at the expense of other jurisdictions. Hines is the most cited author on the research of tax havens, and his work on tax havens was relied upon by the [[Council of Economic Advisors|CEA]] when drafting the [[Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017]].

==Biography==

James Hines was born in Chicago in 1958.  He went to [[Yale University]] for his B.Sc and M.Sc in 1980.  He completed his PhD in [[Harvard University]] in 1986.  After various teaching and research posts in [[Princeton University]] and Harvard University, in 1997 he became Professor of Economics at the [[University of Michigan]].  Hines is a research associate of the [[National Bureau of Economic Research]], and a research director of the International Tax Policy Forum.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://ideas.repec.org/e/phi111.html|title=RePec DATABASE: James R.

Hines is the most cited author on research into [[tax havens]], and has co-authored several papers in the {{slink|#Most important papers on tax havens}}, including the most cited paper.&lt;ref name="respec"/&gt;

Hines has testified to Congress on public tax policy on a number of occasions,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.c-span.org/person/?jameshines|title=James R.

===Hines-Rice paper=== 

In February 1994, Hines and his Harvard PhD student, Eric M. Rice, published their 1990 [[National Bureau of Economic Research]] ("NBER") working paper (No. 3477), in the [[Quarterly Journal of Economics]], on the use of [[tax havens]] by U.S. multinationals, which contained a number of important findings.&lt;ref name="h3"&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://taxdoctoralseminar.web.unc.edu/files/2016/02/Hines-Rice.pdf|title=FISCAL PARADISE: FOREIGN TAX HAVENS AND AMERICAN BUSINESS |author1=James R.

Hines-Rice showed U.S. multinationals were using non-traditional tax havens, like Ireland and Singapore, that had large networks of [[tax treaties]] (which traditional tax havens are restricted from having), enabling them to avoid corporate taxes in all jurisdictions that had [[tax treaties]] with the haven, by a technique they called ''profit shifting'';&lt;ref name="be"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://chicagounbound.uchicago.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=2385&amp;context=law_and_economics|title=What Do We Know About Base Erosion and Profit Shifting?

|[[Corporate tax havens]]. Hines-Rice noted that several of the most favoured locations for U.S. multinationals, such as Ireland, had normal ''headline'' corporate tax rates, but their tax regimes enabled accounting techniques to produce much lower ''effective'' corporate tax rates (e.g. Ireland was the lowest at 4%); these were the little-understood [[BEPS]] tools of the emerging [[corporate tax havens]];&lt;ref name="cesifo"&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.cesifo-group.de/DocDL/cesifo1_wp7171.pdf|title=Firms, Trade and Profit Shifting: Evidence from Aggregate Data|author1=Sébastien Laffitte|author2=Farid Toubal|journal=[[CESifo Economic Studies]]|date=July 2018|quote=Concerning the characterization of tax havens, we follow the definition proposed by Hines and Rice (1994) which has been recently used by Dharmapala and Hines (2009).

|[[Tax haven#Definitions|Definition of a tax haven]]. Hines-Rice felt the variations between havens was too material for a single definition, beyond a requirement for ''low effective tax rates''; distortions from ''profit shifting'' led them to note proxies, including: the [[Corporate haven#GDP-per-capita tax haven proxy|GDP-per-capita proxy]], and the [[Corporate haven#Proxy tests|corporate profitabity proxy]];&lt;ref name="cesifo"/&gt; in June 2018, these tools were used to show that Ireland was the largest tax haven;&lt;ref name="z1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://gabriel-zucman.eu/files/TWZ2018.pdf|title=The Missing Profits of Nations|author1=[[Gabriel Zucman]]|publisher=[[National Bureau of Economic Research]]|author2=Thomas Tørsløv|author3=Ludvig Wier|date=8 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="z2"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/corporations-push-profits-into-tax-havens-as-countries-struggle-in-pursuit-study-says-1528634659|title=Zucman:Corporations Push Profits Into Corporate Tax Havens as Countries Struggle in Pursuit, Gabrial Zucman Study Says|quote=Such profit shifting leads to a total annual revenue loss of $200 billion globally|publisher=[[Wall Street Journal]]|date=10 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="z3"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.irishtimes.com/business/economy/ireland-is-the-world-s-biggest-corporate-tax-haven-say-academics-1.3528401?mode=sample&amp;auth-failed=1&amp;pw-origin=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.irishtimes.com%2Fbusiness%2Feconomy%2Fireland-is-the-world-s-biggest-corporate-tax-haven-say-academics-1.3528401|title=Ireland is the world’s biggest corporate ‘tax haven’, say academics|quote=New Gabriel Zucman study claims State shelters more multinational profits than the entire Caribbean|publisher=[[Irish Times]]|date=13 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

|[[Corporate haven#U.S. as BEPS winner|U.S. as a beneficiary from tax havens]].  An unexpected conclusion from Hines-Rice was that: ''low foreign tax rates [from tax havens] ultimately enhance U.S. tax collections''; by paying little/no foreign taxes, U.S. multinationals had avoided building up foreign tax credits; the 15.5% [[Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017]] levy would prove this [[Base erosion and profit shifting#Complex agendas|finding again]] in 2017.&lt;ref name="dryng"&gt;{{cite journal|url=https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/j.1475-679X.2009.00346.x|title=Using Financial Accounting Data to Examine the Effect of Foreign Operations Located in Tax Havens and Other Countries on US Multinational Firms' Tax Rates|author1=Scott Dyreng|author2=Bradley P.

While Hines always avoided constructing overly specific or quantitative definitions of a tax haven, because of the variability in the types of economies that he had identified as  tax havens, Hines does use a general definition that he employed during research with fellow tax-haven expert, Dhammaka Dharmapala, in 2009:&lt;ref name="d1"/&gt;

==Multinational tax research==

As well as his work on [[BEPS]] and on [[tax havens]], Hines is known for research into how U.S. corporate taxation, and the marginal rate of U.S. corporation tax, drives the behaviours of U.S multinationals.  Hines has been a strong advocate of moving the U.S. to a "territorial" tax model.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.huffingtonpost.com/2011/09/14/territorial-taxation-offshore-corporations-congress_n_961922.html?guccounter=1|title=Corporations Pressure Congress, White House Over ‘Territorial Taxation’ Of Offshore Profits|publisher=The Huffington Post|date=14 September 2011|quote=“We are so out of step with the rest of the world right now. It is important for us to adopt a territorial system,” said University of Michigan Law School Professor James Hines.}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In 2016, Hines, working with German academics, showed that German multinationals make little use of tax havens because the German corporate taxation system follows a "territorial" model.&lt;ref name="hines2016"&gt;{{cite journal| url = https://repository.law.umich.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=2831&amp;context=articles|title=Multinational Firms and Tax Havens|author1=James R.

[..] Furthermore, German firms do not have incentives to structure their foreign operations in ways that avoid repatriating income. Therefore, the tax incentives for German firms to establish tax haven affiliates are likely to differ from those of U.S. firms and bear strong similarities to those of other G-7 and OECD firms.|volume=98|issue=4}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Hines cites the experience of Ireland, a feature on all of Hines' tax haven lists, who has [[Ireland as a tax haven#Global "knowledge hub" for "selling into Europe"|rarely attracted firms from "territorial" taxation systems]].

The son of Christopher Collin (Colin) of [[La Verdière]], he was a volunteer in the Dragoons in 1767.  He became captain of Hussars of [[Lauzun]] in 1778, a colonel of the Paris Cavalry in 1789, and a brigadier in 1795.  He helped to quell the royalist insurrection of 5 October 1795, and joined the Army of Italy in 1796. He commanded the garrison at Paris in 1797, and was appointed General of division the following year. Subsequently, he participated in the campaigns of the [[Army of the Danube]] in 1799, at the [[Battle of Ostrach]] and the [[Battle of Stockach (1799)|Stockach]]; later that year, he participated in Andre Massena's campaigns in northeastern Switzerland, at the [[First Battle of Zurich]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="716">'''Karjalan Liitto''' (in [[English language|English]]: ''Karelian Association'') is an interest group for [[Karelian evacuees]].

The association was established by [[Finnish Karelia|Karelian local governments]], parishes and provincial organizations on 20 April 1940 immediately after the [[Winter War]]. The first chief aim was to attend to the interests of Karelians who had lost their homes.

Today, the association mainly aims to maintain Karelian culture.

[[Karelian question in Finnish politics|The peaceful return of Karelia]] has always been one object of the association.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6396">In the study of tourism, the '''leakage'''&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.unep.org/resourceefficiency/Business/SectoralActivities/Tourism/FactsandFiguresaboutTourism/ImpactsofTourism/EconomicImpactsofTourism/NegativeEconomicImpactsofTourism/tabid/78784/Default.aspx Negative Economic Impacts of Tourism - UNEP Tourism]&lt;/ref&gt; is the way in which revenue generated by tourism is lost to other countries' economies. Leakage may be so significant in some developing countries that it partially neutralizes the money generated by tourism.

==Methods==
Leakage occurs through seven different mechanisms.&lt;ref name="book"&gt;{{cite book
  |last = Mill
|first = Robert Christie
|authorlink =
|title = The Tourism System
|publisher = Kendall/Hunt Publishing Company
|series =
|year = 2002
|doi =
|isbn = }}&lt;/ref&gt; It is an intrinsic component of international tourism and thus is present in every country, to widely varying degrees.&lt;ref name="book2"&gt;{{cite book
  |last = Rasuchelbach
|first = Burghard
|authorlink =
|title = Cooperating for Sustainable Tourism
|publisher =
|series =
|year = 2002
|doi =
|isbn = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Goods and services===
Many countries must purchase goods and services to satisfy their visitors. This includes the cost of raw materials used to make tourism-related goods, such as souvenirs. For starting tourism industries, this is a significant problem, as some countries must import as much as 50% of tourism-related products.

===Infrastructure===
Some less economically developed countries do not have the domestic ability to build tourism-related infrastructure (hotels, airports, etc.). The cost of such infrastructure is then leaked out of the country.

===Foreign factors of production===
Smaller countries often require foreign investment to start their tourism industry. Thus, profits from tourism may be lost to foreign investors. In addition, travel agents outside of the destination country remove money from that market as well.

===Promotional expenditures===
Many countries spend considerable sums of money for advertisements and publicity. Maintaining a presence abroad may increase the volume of tourists to a country but also represent a considerable loss of money to foreign markets.

===Transfer pricing===
Many foreign companies manipulate their pricing to reduce taxes and other duties. In smaller or less developed countries, where many tourism-related companies may be foreign owned, this can represent a substantial loss of income.

===Tax exemptions===
Countries with a small tourism industry may have to give tax exemptions or other offers to increase foreign investment. While this may enlarge the tourism industry there, it must be taken into account as an instrument of income loss.This will lead to lost in income to the host nation as various tax exemptions are provided

===Foreign workers===
Often foreign workers are employed in tourism and especially on a temporary base. These workers typically stay a couple of months in the country, they live on the premises and take all the salary home when they return home after their assignment. Depending the portion of this type of foreign workers it can represent a substantial loss of income.

==Application==
A study of [[tourism]] 'leakage' in [[Thailand]] estimated that 70% of all money spent by tourists ended up leaving [[Thailand]] (via foreign-owned tour operators, airlines, hotels, imported drinks and food, etc.). Estimates for other Third World countries range from 80% in the [[Caribbean]] to 40% in India.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.publicsector.org/local_agenda_21and_you/WhileTravelling/5Questions.html Agenda 21&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

Leakage is not restricted to less-developed countries. Australia experiences a significant leakage effect from Japanese tourists. Though they spend the most per capita of all tourists to Australia, much of what they spend is through Japanese travel companies, Japanese hotels, and other foreign-owned businesses. There is thus significant leakage to Japan's economy.&lt;ref name="book" /&gt;

Leakage not only varies from country to country, but also from industry to industry. High-income tourism may well significantly increase leakage, as that industry likely involves importing more goods and services than usual. Ecological or adventure tourism may exhibit a very small degree of leakage, however, as they place value solely on what the host country has to offer.&lt;ref name="book2" /&gt;

==Effect==
As a result of the leakage effect, tourism industries in developed countries often are much more profitable per dollar received than tourism in smaller countries. Islands, in particular, suffer from significant leakage. In countries such as [[Turkey]] and the [[United Kingdom]], the benefit to the economy from tourism is twice the dollar amount spent by tourists. In smaller places, such as [[Micronesia]] and [[Polynesia]], that benefit is half the dollar amount spent.&lt;ref name="book" /&gt; Some locations have managed to nullify the leakage effect almost entirely - New York City claims to generate seven dollars for the local economy per dollar spent by tourists.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Tourism's Multiplier Effect |url=http://thebeat.iloveny.com/tourisms-multiplier-effect-239.html |date=29 November 2007 |work= |publisher=I Love NY |accessdate=17 July 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some estimates of the degree of leakage claim only 5% of money spent on tourism remains in a developing country's economy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Tourism in Third World Development |url=http://www.uneptie.org/pc/tourism/home.htm |date= |work= |publisher=UNEP DTIE |accessdate=17 July 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reducing leakage==
For many countries, some sources of leakage are unavoidable. Foreign-owned hotels and airlines are necessary for all but the most established of tourism industries. However, encouragement of domestic involvement in a country's tourism industry may reduce leakage in the long run. Currently, the most popular measure is restrictions on spending. Countries may limit the use of foreign currency within their borders, reducing the effect of [[transfer pricing]] (see above). Many countries require visitors to have a certain amount of money before entering, as well.&lt;ref name="book" /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1364">'''Mambo''' is the term for a female (as opposed to the '''[[Houngan]]''', or male) High Priest in the [[Haitian Vodou|Vodou]] religion in [[Haiti]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Mambo|work=vodoureligion.com|url=http://vodoureligion.com/tag/mambo/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Mambo are the highest form of female clergy in the religion, whose responsibility it is to preserve the rituals and songs and maintain the relationship between the spirits and the community as a whole (though some of this is the responsibility of the whole community as well). They are entrusted with leading the service of all of the spirits of their lineage.

There are two ranks of mambo, ''mambo asogwe'' (high priestess) and ''mambo si pwen'' / ''mambo sur point'' ("junior priestess"). A ''mambo asogwe'' is the highest female member of clergy in vodou; she is the only one with authority to ordain other priests (a responsibility shared by Houngan Asogwe, the title for a male High Priest. Vodou does not impose particular responsibilities or limitations based on gender; titles may differ, but the tradition has open gender parity.) Sometimes a mambo may also be a [[bokor|caplata]].

'''New York Air Route Traffic Control Center''' ('''ZNY''')/'''New York [[ARTCC]]''', or '''New York Center''' (via radio communications) is one of 22 [[Air Route Traffic Control Center]]s ([[ARTCC]]) in the United States.

New York Center was the world's first [[Air Route Traffic Control Center]] ([[ARTCC]]), and manages the entire [[New York Metropolitan Area]] and [[Philadelphia]] areas, as well as {{convert|325,0000|sqmi|km2}} of oceanic airspace.

Collectively, the Center is responsible for air traffic service in {{convert|327,0000|sqmi|km2}} of controlled airspace. ZNY assumes a route control over four extremely busy [[Airspace_class_(United_States)#Class_B|Class B]] airports; most of the air traffic in and out of the New York Metropolitan Area. 

Due to multiple factors within the airspace, the ZNY ARTCC is often regarded as one of the most complex airspaces in the United States, and is also one of the busiest in the world with respect to volume of traffic versus volume of airspace.

==Area of responsibility==
The Center is located at 4205 Johnson Avenue on [[Long Island]] in [[Ronkonkoma, New York|Ronkonkoma]], a [[Political_subdivisions_of_New_York_State#Hamlet|hamlet]] ([[unincorporated community]]) in the [[Islip (town), New York|Town of Islip]], [[New York (state)|New York]], [[United States]], near [[New York City]].  [[Long Island MacArthur Airport]] is north of the ARTCC.

Its primary responsibility is the separation of overflights, and the expedited sequencing of arrivals and departures along [[Standard Terminal Arrival Route]]s and [[Standard Instrument Departure]]s for the entire [[New York Metropolitan Area]] and [[Philadelphia]]. 

ZNY assumes control over several ''Class Bravo'' ([[Airspace class (United States)|Class B]]) airports, including
*[[Newark Liberty International Airport]] (EWR) in [[Newark, New Jersey|Newark]]/[[Elizabeth, New Jersey|Elizabeth]], [[New Jersey]]
*[[LaGuardia Airport]] (LGA) in [[New York City]], [[New York (state)|New York]]
*[[John F. Kennedy International Airport]] (JFK) in New York City, New York
*[[Philadelphia International Airport]] (PHL) in [[Philadelphia]]/[[Tinicum Township, Delaware County, Pennsylvania|Tinicum Township]], [[Pennsylvania]]

New York Center manages {{convert|327,0000|sqmi|km2}} of airspace.  Of that, {{convert|17000|sqmi|km2|-3}} are mainland airspace, and the remaining {{convert|325,0000|sqmi|km2}} is oceanic airspace.

==The Basic Breakdown==
The sector shelves start as low 0 [[Above ground level|AGL]] and top out as high as [[Flight Level]] 600 (60,000&amp;nbsp;ft) ASL.  ZNY handles a total of 28 sectors, excluding Oceanic sectors.  These are broken down into Low Altitude and High Altitude sectors, with  16 Low Altitude sectors and 12 High altitude sectors.  Within the Center there are 6 Areas, which other [[ARTCC|ARTCC's]] might call specialties.

==Area Breakdown==
In ZNY, the Areas are Lettered A through F.  

===Area A===
Area A covers the southeast edge of Pennsylvania.  Area A puts arrivals in trail for [[Philadelphia TRACON]] via the BUNTS feed (its busiest) heading to Philadelphia Int'l (PHL), Wilmington DE Airport (ILG) and other Eastern PA and Northern NJ airports. The area also feeds traffic into PCT (Potomac Consolidated [[TRACON]]) which runs arrivals and departures for [[Ronald Reagan Washington National Airport]] (DCA), [[Baltimore-Washington International Thurgood Marshall Airport]] (BWI), [[Washington Dulles International Airport]] (IAD), and other area airports. Area A also feeds Harrisburg Approach, controlling Harrisburg Int'l (MDT), Lancaster Airport (LNS), York (THV), Reading Regional Airport (RDG), Allentown Airport (ABE) and other PA airports. Area A's high altitude sectors work departures from all the above airports, and feed them into existing streams received from Area B departing NY &amp; BOS metro areas as well as those coming from over the ocean and from Canada. This traffic is handed off in trail on en route airways to Washington Center (ZDC) to the South and Cleveland Center (ZOB) to the West.

===Area B===
Area B covers the East side of Pennsylvania, the northern half of New Jersey, and Long Island west of Deer Park (DPK). Area B controls departures heading west, south, and southwest out of ''N90'' ([[New York TRACON]]). Area B sequences most of those departures into streams for the STARs to ''BWI'', ''IAD'', and ''DCA''. Area B also sequences all [[Logan International Airport|Boston Logan]] (BOS) arrivals travelling over [[John F. Kennedy International Airport|JFK Airport]] (JFK) and [[Bradley International Airport|Hartford's Bradley International Airport]] (BDL).

===Area C===
Area C covers the northern edge of Pennsylvania, and controls both eastbound arrivals into ''JFK'' on the LENDY6 STAR and some westbound departures out of ''N90''.

===Area D===
Area D is in the middle of Pennsylvania and borders the Cleveland [[ARTCC]]'s (ZOB) east border. Area D handles the ''PHL'' SPUDS2/SLATT3 STAR along with ''PHL'' departures departing via the PTW (Pottstown VOR, or [[VHF omnidirectional range]]) exit westbound. Area D's High Altitude sectors handle all westbound ''N90'' departures, and the MIP4 (Milton 4) STAR into ''LGA'' and FQM3 (Williamsport 3) STAR into ''EWR''.

===Area E===
Area E is the first set of Oceanic sectors that mainly have control over the Atlantic just offshore from New York and New Jersey.  Area E maintains 2 radar sectors that are both 'offshore'. The first is Sector 66. This sectors owns airspace to the southeast of Kennedy (South of Long Island). There are no VORs or airports within this sector. However, this is one of the busiest, and most difficult, sectors within the facility, mainly due to numerous aircraft that are 'head-on' and are required to descend/ascend through each other's altitudes. Because of this, there is a lot of vectoring and speed control involved. Warning area 107, when active, takes a big chunk of the sector's airspace, thus adding to its complexity. The second 'offshore' radar sector in Area E is Sector 82. Aircraft are off-loaded to this sector when there is weather along the east coast of the US. The rest of the sectors in Area E are all non-radar (ATOP) sectors that control traffic going to/from the Caribbean Islands and Bermuda.

===Area F===
Area F is the other set of Oceanic sectors, and maintains control of the North and South Atlantic. Area F assumes responsibility for three "mainland" high altitude oceanic sectors just off the coast of New York.  This sector becomes extremely busy during the holiday season as many flights are destined for Caribbean and when adverse weather is approaching the eastern seaboard as many flights file flight plans with off shore routing. Complexity in these sectors can make it very challenging due to traffic climbing and descending, crossing, and holding in the sector. The military operates in several warning areas in the airspace, once activated it reduces the airspace by nearly half its original size and capacity. Since there is no defined route structure like most sectors, traffic flows are random, thus increasing difficulty. This area deals with multiple facilities from other countries, such as Santa Maria, Gander, Moncton, San Juan and Piarco. Each facility has its own method and procedure for coordinating aircraft. Area F also controls the area of the North Atlantic including approach control into Bermuda.  ([[Bermuda International Airport]] only controls flights that are in class D airspace.) The rest of the sectors in Area F are all non-radar (ATOP) sectors. They control flights that are crossing to/from Europe in the North and South Atlantic.

Areas E and F are bordered by:
* [[Miami ARTCC]] - KZMA/ZMA (Miami, Florida)
* [[Jacksonville ARTCC]] - KZJX/ZJX (Hilliard, Florida)
* [[Washington ARTCC]] - KZDC/ZDC (Leesburg, Virginia)
* [[Boston ARTCC]] - KZBW/ZBW (Nashua, New Hampshire)
* [[San Juan FIR]] - TJZS/ZSU (Puerto Rico)
* [[Piarco FIR]] (Piarco, Trinidad and Tobago)
* [[Santa Maria FIR]] (Azores, Portugal)
* [[Moncton FIR]] - CZQM (Moncton, New Brunswick)
* [[Gander FIR]] - CZQX (Gander, Newfoundland)

The mother visits family members and eats a lot.]]'''Ngombe''', or ''Lingombe'', is a [[Bantu language]] spoken by about 150,000 people in the [[Democratic Republic of the Congo]]. In general, native speakers live on either side of the [[Congo river]], and its many tributaries; more specifically, [[Province of Équateur|Équateur]] Province, [[Mongala District]] and in areas neighboring it (Sud Ubangi and Équateur districts). Ngombe is written in [[Latin script]].&lt;ref name=ethnlg&gt;{{ cite web |url=http://www.ethnologue.com/show_language.asp?code=ngc |author=Lewis, M.

The deities of the Ngombe include the supreme creator [[Akongo]] and the ancestor goddess [[Mbokomu (deity)|Mbokomu]].&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|pages=145–146

Ngombe includes several dialects in addition to Ngombe proper (Ŋgɔmbɛ). These are ''Wiindza-Baali'', ''Doko'' (Dɔkɔ), and ''Binja'' (also rendered ''Binza'', ''Libindja'', or ''Libinja''). The latter is not the same as the [[Binza language|Binja/Binza language]]. Binja  dialect is primarily spoken in [[Orientale (province)|Orientale Province]] and [[Aketi Territory]], and shares about three-quarters of its linguistic characteristics with standard Ngombe.&lt;ref name=ethnlg/&gt; Maho (2009) lists [[Doko language (Bantu)|Doko]] as a distinct language in a separate group.

In order to ensure optimum utilization of orbit spectrum, the national administrations of countries worldwide undertake regular monitoring exercises. This orbit spectrum is used by service providers to implement satellite based [[satellite television|broadcasting]], [[telecommunication]] and [[meteorological]] services. To ensure quality of services, this orbit spectrum must be used by service providers as per terms and conditions approved by the respective Government. Regulatory measures must be enforced. This practice of regulating the spectrum within the limits of permissions or [[license]]s is part of spectrum management.

==Missions==
Orbit spectrum requires management which in turn needs effective spectrum monitoring exercises to enforce regulatory measures for ensuring legal usage of spectrum resource. Many examples of such spectrum monitoring exercises were undertaken by different [[countries]] around the world. 

===India===
One such initiative is Mission Orbit Spectrum by International Satellite Monitoring Earth Station (ISMES), [[Jalna, Maharashtra|Jalna]] Maharashtra. It was launched under the leadership of 'The Spectrum Man' Ajay Singhal, an IRRS officer and Head of ISMES Jalna since 19 February 2013. During this mission, ISMES exposed gross irregularities in the usage of satellite spectrum allocated to satellite service providers across the country. Approximately 60 cases of violation were uncovered during the first six months of 2014. 

Satellite spectrum usage is governed through specific technical and financial terms and conditions laid down in the licenses issued by the [[Indian government]], as per the provisions of  Indian Telegraphy Act 1885 and Indian Wireless Telegraphy Act 1933.

The orbit spectrum initiative by Ajay Singhal found a place in ''Limca Book of Records'' in January 2017. During this initiative, a low cost satellite spectrum monitoring facility was developed using a manual, steerable, dish antenna system named ''Small Wonder'' and software database named ''SAJAG''. The success of this initiative in highlighting the cases of violation in the usage of satellite spectrum and subsequent remedial actions taken by the satellite service providers was widely recognized.

It was awarded the "Best Securities Company" in 2006 and 2007 by Investor magazine;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Awards|url=http://pans.co.id/?page=penghargaan|accessdate=2010-05-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; "Best Managed Companies" in 2010 by FinanceAsia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Awards|url=http://www.financeasia.com/Gallery/221373,best-managed-companies-awards-jakarta-2010.aspx/29|accessdate=2010-08-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; Panin Sekuritas is Panin Group's division for securities and mutual fund management.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=INDONESIA'S PANIN SEKURITAS OFFERS BONDS VALUED AT $8.3 MLN|publisher=AsiaPulse News|date= February 3, 2005|url= http://goliath.ecnext.com/premium/0199/0199-3632457.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The company was founded in 1989 as the 'Panin Group' set up a private securities firm with the name PT. Panin Sekuritasindo. In 1991 the company opened to new investors and financial partners, and subsequently changed their name to PT. Nusamas Panin.

Healthy growth in Indonesia's financial sector prompted the company's name change to PT. Panin Sekuritas. This was also part of Panin Group's effort to standardize its company divisions naming convention.

In 2000, Panin Sekuritas became a publicly listed and traded company at Indonesia Stock Exchange after several years of consistent growth and profit. With this, the company was allowed by Indonesia's capital market and financial institution regulation body to append "Tbk." to its name to describe that it is a public company. Officially renamed to PT. Panin Sekuritas Tbk.

==Logo==
There are two distinct company logos. The first is a blue three-leaf [[clover]] to describe its affiliation to Indonesia's financial [[Panin Group]]. The design of three-leaf illustrates the three financial divisions of Panin Group: banking, life insurance and securities. The second is the word "Panin Sekuritas" which describes that this is the securities company part of the group.

'''Polish Radio Baranowicze''' was a station of the [[Polish Radio]], located in the city of [[Baranowicze]], which in the interbellum period belonged to the [[Second Polish Republic]]. Opened in the summer of 1938, it was active only for a little more than a year (see: [[Polish September Campaign]]).

The station was opened on July 1, 1938.&lt;ref&gt;[http://radiopolska.pl/portal/staticpages/index.php?page=wykaz-archiwum-am Archives of the Polish Radio]&lt;/ref&gt; Its frequency was 520&amp;nbsp;kHz and range - 120 kilometers, which covered most of the [[Nowogródek Voivodeship (1919–1939)|Nowogrodek Voivodeship]] and northern part of the [[Polesie Voivodeship]]. Main office was located in a building at Narutowicza Street 72, in the outskirts of the city.

Construction of the station and its office began in July 1937, and lasted until spring of 1938, on a real estate provided by the city authorities. Two isolated masts (both 141 meters high) were set, and regular broadcast was not started until October 1938.&lt;ref name="Baranowicze Radio Station"&gt;[http://www.historiaradia.neostrada.pl/Stacja%20nadawcza%20Baranowicze.html Baranowicze Radio Station]&lt;/ref&gt; In the office, there were two recording studios and several rooms for employees. Additionally, a local power plant was modernised, as the station needed twice as much power as the whole city.

First and only director of the station was [[Zbigniew Cis-Bankiewicz]], who also was an announcer. Additional announcers were Maryla Konzalowna, Roman Horoszkiewicz and Stefan Sojecki. Technical services were provided by a group of engineers - Jerzy Foltanski, Roman Roginski, Borys Niewiadomski, Teofil Terlecki, Adam Twarog.&lt;ref name="Baranowicze Radio Station"/&gt;

Following the outbreak of the [[World War II]], the campus of the radio was bombed by the [[Luftwaffe]] on September 16, 1939 &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hermanboel.eu/radiohistory/years-1939.htm European Radio History, year 1939]&lt;/ref&gt; and ceased service. Currently, the 1938 office of the radio is used by the Belarusian TV.

The '''St. Gallen Symposium''', formerly known as the ''Internationales Management Symposium'' and the ''ISC-Symposium'', is an annual conference taking place at the [[University of St. Gallen]] in [[St. Gallen]], [[Switzerland]]. It is the world’s leading initiative for intergenerational debates on economic, political, and social developments between decision makers of today and tomorrow.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.symposium.org/main-event/about|title=About|date=2018-09-23|work=St. Gallen Symposium|access-date=2018-11-22|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; The symposium’s goal is to contribute to the preservation and further development of a social and liberal economic order.

The St. Gallen Symposium was founded in 1969 as a response to the international [[Protests of 1968|student unrests of 1968]] and has since then been organised by the ''International Students’ Committee (ISC)'', a student initiative at the University of St. Gallen.&lt;ref name="SGT SGS"&gt;[[St. Galler Tagblatt]], 13 May 2011, ''St. Gallen Symposium''.&lt;/ref&gt; Currently, this platform for dialogue welcomes more than 1.000 participants every year and is among the largest and most eminent student-run events. Personalities such as [[Josef Ackermann]], [[Mohammad Khatami]], [[Laurence D. Fink]], [[Dominic Barton]], [[Sigmar Gabriel]] and [[Christine Lagarde]] have attended the symposium in recent years.&lt;ref&gt;St. Galler Tagblatt, [http://www.tagblatt.ch/nachrichten/wirtschaft/tb-wo/art123834,2565928 ''Ab und zu ein Lächeln entlocken''], retrieved 10 December 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

== The goal ==
[[File:Campus Luftbild.jpg|thumb|left|Aerial view of the campus of the University of St. Gallen during the 41st St.&amp;nbsp;Gallen Symposium]]
The St. Gallen Symposium as a platform for dialogue strives to foster constructive debates on current economic, political and social developments.&lt;ref&gt;Citizen Lab, Munk School of Global Affairs, [[University of Toronto]], [http://citizenlab.org/2011/05/rafal-rohozinski-and-rex-hughes-on-cybercrime-at-the-41st-st-gallen-symposium/ Rafal Rohozinski and Rex Hughes on Cybercrime at the 41st St. Gallen Symposium], retrieved 11 December 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; This event gives particular attention to an intergenerational dialogue, characterised by mutual respect. Thus, particular focus is given to discussion in smaller, more informal settings, where the so-called ''Leaders of Tomorrow'' can debate with the ''Leaders of Today'' on equal footing.&lt;ref&gt;[[Handelsblatt|Handelsblatt News am Abend]], 12 May 2011, ''St. Gallen stellt die Machtfrage''.&lt;/ref&gt;

The topic of the symposium is chosen each year based on relevant issues and current events. In recent years, the topic has developed from being more [[business]]-oriented to more holistic themes, as embodied by the topics ''Growth – the good, the bad, and the ugly'' (2016), ''The dilemma of disruption'' (2017) and ''Beyond the end of work'' (2018).&lt;ref&gt;Lichtensteiner Volksblatt, 8 May 2010, ''Zukunftsmärkte Brauchen Technologie und Innovation''.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.symposium.org/impressions|title=Highlights|date=2015-12-12|work=St. Gallen Symposium|access-date=2018-11-22|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==

=== Beginning ===
Five students of the University of St. Gallen – Clemens Ernst Brenninkmeyer, Franz Karl Kriegler, Urs Schneider, Wolfgang Schürer and Terje I. Wølner-Hanssen – founded the International Students’ Committee (ISC), which has since organised the St. Gallen Symposium annually.&lt;ref&gt;swissinfo.ch [http://www.swissinfo.ch/eng/business/Student_symposium_spans_two_eras_of_unrest.html?cid=8831798 Student symposium spans tow eras of unrest], retrieved 12 December 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; It was established in February 1970 as an alternative to the international student unrests of 1968. The name ''International Students’ Committee'' was chosen because of the five different countries the founders originated from, namely [[Austria]], [[Germany]], [[Netherlands]], [[Norway]] and [[Switzerland]]. On 30 June and 1 July 1970 the first ''International Management Dialogue'' was held at the University of St. Gallen, with 100 outstanding students and as many business leaders taking part.&lt;ref name="history"&gt;International Students' Committee, [http://www.stgallen-symposium.org/de-ch/About-Us/History.aspx About us: History]{{dead link|date=May 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}, retrieved 22 November 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== First years ===
The [[Club of Rome]] study ''[[The Limits to Growth]]'',&lt;sup&gt;[[St. Gallen Symposium#cite%20note-Meadows-1972-8|[8]]]&lt;/sup&gt; which analysed the effect of exponential growth on a finite planet, was presented at the third symposium in 1972. The global economic downturn caused by the [[1973 oil crisis]] and problems with securing the continuity of the student initiative led to the symposium not being held in 1974. In response, the St. Gallen Foundation for International Studies was founded in order to safeguard the continuity of the International Students’ Committee.&lt;ref name="history"/&gt;

=== The 1980s ===
A big change was introduced in 1989, when the International Students’ Committee founded the ''St. Gallen Wings of Excellence Award'', which today counts as one of the largest and most renowned student essay competitions worldwide. Students were now required to submit an essay, of which only the 200 best were selected for a participation in the St. Gallen Symposium. Moreover, authors of the best contributions were bestowed with the St. Gallen Wings of Excellence Award, CHF 20,000.– in prize money, and the chance to present their essays at the St. Gallen Symposium ([[St. Gallen Symposium#The%20St.%20Gallen%20Wings%20of%20Excellence%20Award|see below]]).&lt;ref name="SGT SGS"/&gt;

=== 1995-2010 ===
[[File:Kofi Annan, Neuorientierung 1995.jpg|thumb|left|Kofi Annan at the bestowal of the Freedom-Prize of the Max Schmidheiny Foundation]]
Since the mid-1990s, the ISC has tried to raise the international profile of the symposium, as well as improve the quality of the dialogue. In this restructuring, a new logo was introduced and the name "International Management Symposium" was changed to ISC-Symposium. Moreover, the ISC gave a financial support for the construction of the Executive Campus HSG at the University of St. Gallen during this period.

With the burst of the [[dot-com bubble]], the [[September 11 attacks]] and the bankruptcy of [[Swissair]] – one of the symposium’s most important benefactors – the beginning of the new millennium posed great challenges for the subsequent year.

In 2002 the [[Swiss Federal Council]] commissioned the ISC to organise the International Conference on Federalism while maintaining the structure of the symposium.&lt;ref&gt;news aktuell, [http://www.presseportal.ch/de/pm/100003572/100019149/internationalefoederalismuskonferenz-2002-an-der-universitaet-st-gallen-27-30-august Internationale Föderalismuskonferenz 2002 an der Universität St. Gallen], retrieved 22 November 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

The current name, St. Gallen Symposium, was introduced in 2005.

In the following year [[Kofi Annan]], Secretary-General of the [[United Nations]], received the Freedom Prize of the Max Schmidheiny Foundation, which was already awarded to him in 2003.&lt;ref&gt;Max Schmidheiny Stiftung, [http://www.ms-foundation.org/site/index.cfm?id_art=28948&amp;vsprache=DE Preisträger 2003: Kofi Annan], retrieved 22 November 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Strategic reorientation since 2010 ===
For the 40&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; St. Gallen Symposium in 2010, a comprehensive modernisation of the conceptual design followed in order to foster intergenerational dialogue. The duration of the symposium was reduced by half a day to two days and so-called Topic Leaders, who are responsible for the moderation of several sessions, joined the group of speakers. Furthermore, the so-called Knowledge Pool enlarged the selection of student participants. The Knowledge Pool consists of 100 students who are handpicked by the ISC and aims at setting an antipole to the 100 winners of the mainly academical student essay competition, the St. Gallen Wings of Excellence Award.&lt;sup&gt;[[St. Gallen Symposium#cite%20note-13|[13]]]&lt;/sup&gt; Furthermore, the Global Perspectives Barometer was introduced, which has since been conducted annualy in collaboration with [[GfK|GfK-Verein]] ([[Credit Suisse]] until 2013) among current and past student participants to survey their opinion on prevailing challenges.&lt;ref name="alumni"&gt;HSG Alumni, [http://www.alumni.unisg.ch/en/home/news/news/40-st-gallen-symposium/ 40. St. Gallen Symposium] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110827200741/http://www.alumni.unisg.ch/en/home/news/news/40-st-gallen-symposium/ |date=27 August 2011 }}, retrieved 11 December 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;GfK-Verein, [http://www.gfk-verein.org/presse/clash-der-generationen-angehende-fuhrungskrafte-unzufrieden-aktuellen-entscheidern Clash der Generationen – angehende Führungskräfte unzufrieden mit aktuellen Entscheidern], retrieved 29 August 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;

To enhance the awareness about the St. Gallen Symposium in Asia, the ISC opened an office in Singapore in 2012. Furthermore, due to the strategic reorientation, a new group of participants, the ''Aspiring Leaders'', and ''Year-Round Events'' were introduced. The ''Aspiring Leaders'' are young decision makers who reached their first milestones and thus fill the gap between the ''Leaders of Tomorrow'' and ''Leaders of Today''.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.symposium.org/communities|title=Communities|date=2015-12-12|work=St. Gallen Symposium|access-date=2018-11-22|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ''Year-Round Events'' fulfill the aim of the St. Gallen Symposium to create an intergenerational dialogue throughout the whole year, as opposed to only the St. Gallen Symposium itself. The biggest ''Year-Round Events'' are the Singapore Reception in November and the Zurich Reception in January.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.symposium.org/receptions|title=Receptions|date=2018-10-12|work=St. Gallen Symposium|access-date=2018-11-22|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Programme and sessions ==
[[File:Sigmar Gabriel 2018 St. Gallen Symposium.jpg|thumb|right|Sigmar Gabriel holding a speech at the 48. St. Gallen Symposium]]
The St. Gallen Symposium takes place during three days in the beginning of May. The official program includes different kind of sessions: &lt;ref&gt;Walliser Bote, 14 May 2011, ''Energiesicherheit hat einen hohen Preis''.&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt;International Students' Committee, [http://stgallen-symposium.org/de-CH/Leaders-of-Tomorrow/Student-Essay-Competition/Programme.aspx Programm]{{dead link|date=March 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}, retrieved 11 December 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

* Plenary Sessions serve as an introduction to the main topics and raise controversial issues, which serve as the starting point for the following Insight Sessions. Plenary Sessions are divided into the ''One-on-One'', where two people meet on stage, the ''Keynote Panel'', a traditional panel discussion, and the ''Keynote Address'', where a speaker delivers a speech.
* The roughly 30 Insight Sessions are held in smaller groups of about 25–35 attendees and serve as a follow-up to the Plenary Sessions. A characteristic of Insight Sessions is the very personal framework. A speaker initiates the discussion, whereas the main part of an Insight Session consists of a vibrant discussion moderated by a Topic Leader. To achieve a lively discussion the [[Chatham House Rule]] is applied.
* Interactive Sessions take place simultaneously as the Insight Sessions. Compared to Insight Sessions, the focus of Interactive Sessions is laid on the Topic itself rather than on the Topic Leader and Speaker. With this environment, participants can elaborate possible solutions in an interactive and intimate environment. Insight Sessions are held in a small setting with 20 participants at most.
*Social Sessions enable the participants to continue to engage in an informal dialogue beyond the official programme, for example in Dinner Nights or lunches.
*Furthermore, Public Insight Sessions aim to introduce the participants into complex issues and theories. Those sessions often only deal in a distant way with the topic of the St. Gallen Symposium. Public Insight Sessions are public to anyone interested in the St. Gallen Symposium and its initiative. 

Apart from Public Insight Sessions, the sessions are snot open to the public. However, selected Plenary Sessions are live and broadcast on the St. Gallen Symposium’s official Youtube channel.&lt;ref&gt;St. Galler Tagblatt, [http://www.tagblatt.ch/ostschweiz/stgallen/stadtstgallen/tb-st/HSG-bereit-fuer-Symposium;art186,2564200 HSG bereit für Symposium], retrieved 11 December 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, with the support of the Ria &amp; Arthur Dietschweiler Foundation, key findings of the annual symposium are presented and discussed in the St. Gallen Symposium ''Public Forum.''

The St. Gallen Symposium has three equally important participant groups: the ''Leaders of Today'', the ''Leaders of Tomorrow'', and the ''Aspiring Leaders''.&lt;ref name="alumni"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Neue Zürcher Zeitung]], 9 May 2011, ''Prominenz in St. Gallen''.&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''Leaders of Today'' consist of 600 decision makers from the economic, political, social and academic fields. This group can be separated into partners, business participants, guests, speakers and Topic Leaders, which moderate the discussions.&lt;ref&gt;Swiss Embassy China, 14 May 2010, ''St. Gallen Symposium reaches out in China''.&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''Leaders of Tomorrow'' are 200 outstanding personalities and young minds below the age of 30. Their qualification is evaluated according to the criteria for the ''St. Gallen Wings of Excellence Award'' or the ''Knowledge Pool''.&lt;ref name="wings"&gt;wirtschaft.ch, [http://www.wirtschaft.ch/St+Gallen+Wings+of+Excellence+Award/308846/detail.htm St. Gallen Wings of Excellence Award], retrieved 11 December 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt;Semestra.ch, [http://www.semestra.ch/news/artikel/40-jahre-st.-gallen-symposium 40 Jahre St. Gallen Symposium], retrieved 12 December 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; The people who are selected through the ''Knowledge Pool'' must fulfill several criteria, such as a relation to the topic of the St. Gallen Symposium or special achievements. The St. Gallen Symposium wants to offer a platform for dialogue to the student participants, where they are able to discuss on one level with today’s decision makers. Furthermore, the students should challenge these decision makers, allowing new lines of thought and potential solutions for current issues to evolve.

The ''Aspiring Leaders'' are decision makers who have the potential to take on a leading role, not only in a specific company, but also in the whole industry. ''Aspiring Leaders'' consist of two main groups ''Future Corporate Leaders'' and ''Emerging Entrepreneurs''. They have already reached the first milestones and thus form the link between the Leaders of Today and the Leaders of Tomorrow; this also in terms of age.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;



== Prize ceremony ==
Every year, during the St. Gallen Symposium, the St. Gallen Wings of Excellence Award is awarded. The St. Gallen Wings of Excellence Award is an essay competition for students from all over the world. In addition, from 1979 to 2003, the St. Gallen Symposium was the platform for the bestowal of the Max Schmidheiny Foundation’s Freedom Prize.

=== The St. Gallen Wings of Excellence Award ===
[[File:RGB ISC Wings mitText pos Kopie.gif|thumb|left|The logo of the St. Gallen Wings of Excellence Award]]The St. Gallen Wings of Excellence Award is an essay competition for students on graduate or postgraduate level. The authors of the 100 best submissions get the chance travel to St. Gallen for one week and participate in the St. Gallen Symposium. Since the essay’s topic is always related to the symposium’s main topic of discussion, the five best authors have the possibility to present their essay in front of the global audience during the Conference. It is endowed with CHF 20’000. With more than 1000 contributions from over 60 different countries annually, the St. Gallen Wings of Excellence Award belongs to the biggest student essay competitions of its kind.&lt;ref name="JP"&gt;[[Japan Times]], [http://www.japantimes.co.jp/text/nn20101201f1.html Young urged to pursue St. Gallen Forum], retrieved 11 December 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;e-fellows.net, [http://www.e-fellows.net/HOME/Archiv/Vor-Ort/St.-Gallen-Wings-of-Excellence-Award St. Gallen Wings of Excellence Award], retrieved 12 December 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;


The evaluation process is completely anonymous and carried out by a preliminary jury and a main jury. The preliminary jury consists of PhD students of the University of St. Gallen as well as the ETH Zurich whereas the main jury comprises professors, corporate executives, entrepreneurs and politicians. The current president of the preliminary jury is Heike Bruch and the main jury’s president is Georg F. von Krogh. Other members of the main jury are Peter Day, Nigel Fretwell, Aditya Ghosh, and Riz Khan.&lt;ref&gt;International Students' Committee, [http://www.stgallen-symposium.org/en/Join-us/Vorjury.aspx Vorjury] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120909010715/http://www.stgallen-symposium.org/en/Join-us/Vorjury.aspx |date=9 September 2012 }}, retrieved 11 December 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt;International Students' Committee, {{cite web |url=http://www.symposium.org/en/who-we-are/Organisers/Award-Jury |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-09-29 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141009035654/http://www.symposium.org/en/who-we-are/Organisers/Award-Jury |archivedate=9 October 2014 |df=dmy-all }}, retrieved 29 September 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;

The St. Gallen Wings of Excellence Award was first launched in 1989 to select the student participants for the symposium and has been modified several times in the past. The most essential adjustment was the restriction of the eligibility to graduate and postgraduate students in 2009 and a simultaneous reduction of the invitations based on the essay competition from 200 to 100 invitations. The other 100 students have since then been recruited by the ISC through the so-called Knowledge Pool.&lt;ref&gt;Market Magazine, 24 August 2010, ''Architekten unserer Zukunft – Interview mit Shama Kabani''.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Freedom-Prize of the Max Schmidheiny Foundation ===
From 1979 until 2003 the Max Schmidheiny Foundation annually awarded its Freedom Prize during the symposium. The prestigious honourees include [[Kofi Annan]], Nicolas Hayek, [[International Committee of the Red Cross|the International Committee of the Red Cross]], [[Jorma Ollila]] and [[Muhammad Yunus]]. In 2003 the Max Schmidheiny Foundation decided to focus on other activities and abandoned the Freedom Prize.

== Organisation ==

=== International Students’ Committee (ISC) ===
Since its establishment in 1969, the St. Gallen Symposium has been organised by the International Students’ Committee, an independent non-profit organisation and an accredited association of the University of St. Gallen. Every year, it consists of a team of about 30 students from the University of St. Gallen, who pause their studies for one year. This team includes three – in former years two – members of the previous ISC-Team who form the Head of the Organising Committee.&lt;ref name="SGT SGS"/&gt;&lt;ref name="FAZ"&gt;[[Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung]], [http://www.faz.net/aktuell/beruf-chance/isc-symposion-praktisches-management-in-der-villa-kunterbunt-1230840.html ISC-Symposium: Praktisches Management in der Villa Kunterbunt], retrieved 12 December 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; During the Symposium, the ISC is supported by a crew of about 400 volunteers, all students from the University of St. Gallen. [[Martin Blessing]], [[Konrad Hummler]], [[Walter Kielholz]] and Christoph Loos are among the most famous alumni of the ISC.

=== St. Gallen Foundation for International Studies (SSIS) ===
[[File:Ackermann begradigt.png|left|thumb|Josef Ackermann, former president of the St. Gallen Foundation for International Studies, at the 40. St. Gallen Symposium]]
The St. Gallen Foundation for International Studies acts as the supervisory body and ensures the continuity of the symposium given the annually changing organising team.&lt;ref&gt;International Students' Committee, [http://www.symposium.org/en/who-we-are/Organisers/St-Gallen-Foundation St. Galler Stiftung für Internationale Studien] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140416175205/http://www.symposium.org/en/who-we-are/Organisers/St-Gallen-Foundation |date=16 April 2014 }}, retrieved 11 December 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; The foundation consists of about twelve members, with Beat Ulrich being the current CEO. Former CEOs include Philip Erzinger, Andreas Kirchschläger and Wolfgang Schürer.

The Board of Trustees supervises the St. Gallen Foundation for International Studies with [[Peter Voser]] and [[Karin Keller-Sutter]] as its Chairman and Vice Chairman respectively. Further members are Thomas Bieger, Peter Gomez, Bénédict G. F. Hentsch, [[Christian Mumenthaler]], Christoph Loos, [[Walter Kielholz]], Ralph Schmitz-Dräger, Gerhard Schwarz and Bettina Würth.&lt;ref&gt;International Students' Committee, [http://www.symposium.org/en/who-we-are/Organisers/St-Gallen-Foundation/Board-of-Trustees Stiftungsrat] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140329095533/http://symposium.org/en/who-we-are/Organisers/St-Gallen-Foundation/Board-of-Trustees |date=29 March 2014 }}, retrieved 15 April 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Josef Ackermann]] is the honorary chairman and former member of the board.&lt;ref&gt;International Students’ Committee, [http://stgallen-symposium.org/News.aspx?sc_itemid={05EAEB23-AB05-4E75-A6E7-6B6D91517D81} Changes in the Board of Trustees]{{dead link|date=March 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}, retrieved 28 May 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Funding ===
The 1974 established Circle of Benefactors constitutes the key element in the non-profit organisation’s funding. Currently, it encompasses more than 400 companies, which commit themselves for three years at a time to support the St. Gallen Symposium with a certain financial amount. By establishing this long-term relation, the continuity is secured and a situation as in 1974, when the symposium had to be cancelled, can be prevented. Besides the participation in the St. Gallen Symposium, these partners receive an invitation to the Dinner for the Circle of Benefactors, taking place on the Wednesday of the Symposium.&lt;ref&gt;International Students' Committee, [http://www.stgallen-symposium.org/Partners/Circle-of-Benefactors.aspx Fördererkreis] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120122065105/http://www.stgallen-symposium.org/Partners/Circle-of-Benefactors.aspx |date=22 January 2012 }}, retrieved 11 December 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; 

Within this circle are currently eleven Main Partners, who provide special support in their respective areas: [[ABB Group|ABB]], [[Accenture]], [[BMW]], [[Hewlett Packard Enterprise]], [[Interbrand]], [[Microsoft]], [[UBS]] and [[Xerox]]. In addition, there are three Main Partners exclusively supporting the ''Leaders of Tomorrow'': ''Credit Suisse'', ''Swiss Re'' and ''ZF Friedrichshafen''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.symposium.org/circleofbenefactors|title=Circle of Benefactors|date=2015-12-12|work=St. Gallen Symposium|access-date=2018-11-22|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The St. Gallen Symposium has established a close cooperation and partnership with the Max Schmidheiny Foundation as well as the University of St. Gallen, which puts its infrastructure at the symposium’s disposal every year. Through the support of the St. Gallen based Ria &amp; Arthur Dietschweiler Foundation, the St. Gallen Symposium Public Forum is enabled.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.symposium.org/supporting-institutions|title=Supporting Institutions|date=2018-04-28|work=St. Gallen Symposium|access-date=2018-11-22|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Moreover, there are numerous donors, who contribute greatly to the funding.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.symposium.org/donors|title=Donors|date=2015-12-12|work=St. Gallen Symposium|access-date=2018-11-22|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Taokas''' ({{zh|c=道卡斯族|p=Dàokǎsī Zú}}) is one of a number of [[Taiwanese aborigines|indigenous ethno-linguistic groups]] that inhabited the plains of western [[Taiwan]]. The Taokas were located in the areas around today's [[Hsinchu City]]/[[Hsinchu County]], [[Miaoli County]], and [[Taichung City]] region. Several Taokas groups have been historically linked to many revolts that plagued Taiwan during the [[Qing]] era (1683–1895). The Taokas were not always opposed to Han encroachment on their lands as several Taokas groups were involved in building the [[Dajia District|Ta-Chia]] [[Mazu (goddess)|Mazu]] Temple. Today, only a small number of people in the central city of [[Puli, Nantou|Puli]] identify themselves as ethnic Taokas or even [[Taiwanese Aborigines]].
