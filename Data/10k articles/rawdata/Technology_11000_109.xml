'''Abram Lyle''' (14 December 1820 – 30 April 1891) is noted for founding the sugar refiners '' Abram Lyle &amp; Sons'' which merged with the company of his rival [[Henry Tate]] to become [[Tate &amp; Lyle]] in 1921.

== Early life ==

He was born on 14 December 1820 in the [[seaport]] of [[Greenock]], [[Renfrewshire]], in [[Scotland]], and at twelve years old became an apprentice in a lawyer's office. He then joined his father's [[cooper (profession)|cooper]]age businesses and in partnership with a friend, John Kerr, developed a shipping business, making the Lyle fleet one of the largest in Greenock. The area was heavily involved in the [[sugar]] trade with the [[West Indies]], and his business included transporting sugar.

==Sugar refining ==
[[File:Tate and Lyle building - geograph.org.uk - 1124019.jpg|thumb|right|Tate &amp; Lyle syrup refinery at Plaistow Wharf, 2009]]
Together with four partners he purchased the ''Glebe Sugar Refinery'' {{efn| Located at {{coord|55.953065|-4.76269|display=inline}} }} in 1865, and so added sugar refining to his other business interests. When John Kerr, the principal partner, died in 1872, Lyle sold his shares and began the search for a site for a new refinery.{{sfn|Chalmin|1990|p=90}}

Together with his three sons he bought two wharves at [[Plaistow, Newham|Plaistow]] in East [[London]] in 1881 to construct a refinery for producing [[Golden Syrup]].{{sfn|Dinham|Hines|1984|p=170}} The site happened to be around {{convert|1.5|mi|km}} from the sugar refinery of his rival, [[Henry Tate]]. In the first year Lyle's refinery showed a loss of £30,000, with economies being made by asking staff to wait for their wages on occasion, but eventually the business came to dominate the [[United Kingdom]] market for ''Golden Syrup''.{{sfn|Maitland||p=198}}

;Out of the strong came forth sweetness

The brand, sold in a distinctive green and gold lidded tin with an image of a lion surrounded by bees, is believed to be Britain's oldest. The design of the tin decoration, which includes a biblical quotation, has remained almost unchanged since 1885.{{sfn|BBC|2006}}

In the [[Book of Judges]],  [[Samson]] was travelling to the land of the Philistines in search of a wife. During the journey he killed a lion, and on his return past the same spot he noticed that a swarm of bees had formed a comb of honey in the carcass. Samson later turned this into a riddle at a wedding: "Out of the eater came forth meat and out of the strong came forth sweetness".({{bibleref|Judges|14:14}}) While no one is sure why this particular quotation was chosen, it has been suggested that it refers either to the strength of the Lyle company which delivers the sweet syrup or possibly even to the trademark tins in which the syrup was sold.

Sugar refineries belonging to [[Tate &amp; Lyle]] continued as a major industry in Greenock (but with difficulties{{sfn|Glasgow Herald|1952}}) until the 1980s, then declining sugar consumption and a shift away from [[cane sugar]] led to closure of the last refinery in 1997. There is still a warehouse that was used in the past to store sugar in the town's [[Firth of Clyde#Shipping in the Firth|''Ocean Terminal'']].

== Personal life ==

Lyle was [[Provost (civil)|Provost]] of Greenock from 1876 to 1879.{{sfn|Gloucester Citizen|1877|p=2}} An [[church elder|elder]] of St Michael's [[Presbyterian Church]] in Greenock, Lyle himself chose the biblical quotation for the syrup tins. He was a pious man and a strict [[teetotaller]], who once declared that he would "rather see a son of his carried home dead than drunk".{{sfn|Barrett|Calvi|2013|p=ix}}

Lyle was the son of Abram Lyle and Mary Campbell. He married Mary Park, daughter of William Park, on 14 December 1846 and the couple had five sons and one daughter:&lt;ref&gt;[http://thepeerage.com/p50108.htm#i501079 Abram Lyle - thePeerage]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Anker''' is a brand of Chinese electronics company '''Anker Innovations''' (formerly '''Oceanwing''').&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.digitaltrends.com/mobile/anker-innovations-eufy-roav-zolo-anker-nebula/|title=Anker Innovations’ six key sub-brands focus on smart home, batteries, and more|last=Chokkattu|first=Julian|date=2018-01-08|website=[[Digital Trends]]|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-07-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; based in [[Shenzhen]], [[Guangdong]]. The brand is known for producing computer and mobile peripherals, especially [[Battery_charger#Power_bank|power bank]]s.

==History==
[[File:AnkerAstro.jpg|thumb|''Anker Astro'', a mobile battery charger introduced in 2011]]Steven Yang started Anker in 2011 after working as software engineer for [[Google]] in [[California]]. He moved to [[Shenzhen]], China. In early 2012 ''Google'''s then-head of sales in China, Dongping Zhao, was hired and as of 2018 is president of ''Anker Innovations''.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.theverge.com/2017/5/22/15673712/anker-battery-charger-amazon-empire-steven-yang-interview|title=How Anker is beating Apple and Samsung at their own accessory game|last=Staff|first=Nick|date=2017-05-22|website=[[The Verge]]|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2017-05-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2012, Anker switched its focus from replacement laptop batteries to smartphone [[battery charger]]s and wall chargers.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Anker maintains subsidiaries in [[California]], [[Germany]], the [[United Kingdom]], [[Japan]] and [[China]] as well as contractors in [[South Korea]], [[Kuwait]], [[Saudi Arabia]] and [[Romania]]. Before 2017 Anker devices were almost exclusively sold at [[Amazon Marketplace]].

==Products==
Anker charging devices use its ''PowerIQ'' proprietary technology, which detects the connected device and automatically optimizes the [[Current source|current]] delivered, thereby reducing the amount of time for a device to reach full charge.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Many of Anker's charging devices also use various fast-charging technologies, such as [[Quick Charge]]. Anker was mentioned in 2015 as the leading brand of mobile chargers on [[Amazon.com]].&lt;ref name="internetretailer"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.digitalcommerce360.com/2015/10/03/how-chinese-startup-became-top-seller-amazoncom/|title=How a Chinese startup became a top seller on Amazon.com|publisher=internetretailer.com|accessdate=2017-05-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Outside of its core competency, Anker also incorporates other product lines:
* ''Eufy'' (smart home appliances, since September 2016)&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://techcrunch.com/2016/09/14/eufy/|title=Anker launches sister brand for home automation|last=Kamps|first=Haje Jan|website=TechCrunch|access-date=2017-05-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
* ''Soundcore'' (headphones and portable speakers)
* ''Zolo'' (headphones and portable speakers, since 2018)
* ''Nebula'' (portable [[video projector]]s)
* ''Roav'' (car accessories)

==Controversies==
In 2014, an [[Indiegogo]] campaign to promote a set of magnetic accessories called ''Zolo'' was launched.&lt;ref name="indiegogo"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.indiegogo.com/projects/zolo-a-magnetic-case-battery-cable-system--2#/|publisher=indiegogo.com|title=Zolo: A Magnetic Case, Battery &amp;amp; Cable System &amp;#124; Indiegogo|accessdate=2016-11-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; Due to prolonged manufacturing challenges the project was set on hold and 1863 backers were offered a 200% refund.

In 2016, a batch of Anker USB-C charging cables suffered a manufacturing defect that could potentially cause damage to connected hardware, leading to a recall.&lt;ref name="The Register"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theregister.co.uk/2016/08/30/anker_usbc_cables_recalled#/|publisher=TheRegister.com|title=Ankers away!

== Technology ==
The AppsFlyer [[Software development kit|Software Development Kit]] is available for [[iPhone]], [[Android (operating system)|Android]], and [[Windows Phone]] [[Application software|apps]]. In 2014, AppsFlyer developed a complementary product called OneLink&lt;ref name="venturebeat.com"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://venturebeat.com/2014/12/03/appsflyers-onelink-makes-app-installs-just-one-more-step-in-following-an-ad/|title=AppsFlyer’s OneLink makes app installs just one more step in following an ad|website=VentureBeat|accessdate=25 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; which provides deep linking support for custom media sources. In November 2014 [[TechCrunch]] article, AppsFlyer was identified by Apptopia as the most widely used SDK for analytics after [[Flurry (company)|Flurry]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://techcrunch.com/2014/11/19/apptopias-new-service-is-a-builtwith-for-apps/|title=Apptopia’s New Service Is A "BuiltWith" For Apps|last=Perez|first=Sarah|accessdate=11 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Once the AppsFlyer SDK is installed in a [[mobile app]], it provides advertisers with conversion data for their user acquisition and retention campaigns. Advertisers login to their dashboard, and can monitor which media source was responsible for the mobile activity. Based on this information, advertisers then are able to optimize their advertising budget.

AppsFlyer has the following features to help support advertisers' decision-making: Retention reports, Cohort analysis, TV app ad attribution,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.broadcastingcable.com/news/technology/appsflyer-launches-tv-attribution-tool/140181|title=AppsFlyer Launches TV Attribution Tool|website=www.broadcastingcable.com|accessdate=25 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="venturebeat1"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://venturebeat.com/2015/04/23/appsflyer-claims-first-tool-to-track-effectiveness-of-tv-ads-on-app-installs/|title=Was that Kate Upton Super Bowl ad worth it?

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3898">'''Atomtronics''' is an emerging sub-field of [[ultracold atom|ultracold atomic physics]] which encompasses a broad range of topics featuring guided atomic [[matter wave]]s. The systems typically include components analogous to those found in [[electronics|electronic]] or [[optics|optical]] systems, such as [[beam splitter]]s and [[transistor]]s. Applications range from studies of fundamental [[physics]] to the development of practical devices.

== Etymology ==
Atomtronics is a contraction of "atom" and "[[electronics]]", in reference to the creation of atomic analogues of electronic components, such as [[transistor]]s and [[diode]]s, and also electronic materials such as [[semiconductor]]s.&lt;ref&gt;B. T. Seaman, M. Krämer, D. Z. Anderson, and M. J. Holland, "Atomtronics: Ultracold-atom analogs of electronic devices" – ''Physical Review A'' {{doi|10.1103/PhysRevA.75.023615}} [http://link.aps.org/abstract/PRA/v75/e023615]&lt;/ref&gt; The field itself has considerable overlap with [[atom optics]] and [[quantum simulator|quantum simulation]], and is not strictly limited to the development of electronic-like components.&lt;ref&gt;L. Amico, A. Osterloh, and F.S. Cataliotti "Quantum Many Particle Systems in Ring-Shaped Optical Lattices" – ''Physical Review Letters'' {{doi|10.1103/PhysRevLett.95.063201}} [http://journals.aps.org/prl/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevLett.95.063201],&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;R. Labouvie, B. Santra, S. Heun, S. Wimberger, and H. Ott "Negative Differential Conductivity in an Interacting Quantum Gas" — ''Physical Review Letters'' {{doi|10.1103/PhysRevLett.115.050601}} [http://journals.aps.org/prl/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevLett.115.050601]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Methodology ==
Three major elements are required for an atomtronic circuit. The first is a [[Bose-Einstein condensate]], which is needed for its [[coherence (physics)|coherent]] and [[superfluid]] properties, although an ultracold [[Fermi gas]] may also be used for certain applications. The second is a tailored trapping potential, which can be generated [[optical tweezers|optically]], [[magnetic trap (atoms)|magnetically]], or using a combination of both. The final element is a method to induce movement of atoms within the potential, which can be achieved in a number of ways. For example, a transistor-like atomtronic circuit may be realized by a ring-shaped trap divided into two by two moveable weak barriers, with the two separate parts of the ring acting as the drain and the source, and the barriers acting as the gate. As the barriers move, atoms flow from the source to the drain.&lt;ref&gt;F. Jendrzejewski, S. Eckel, N. Murray, C. Lanier, M. Edwards, C. J. Lobb, and G. K. Campbell, "Resistive Flow in a Weakly Interacting Bose-Einstein Condensate" – ''Physical Review Letters'' {{doi|10.1103/PhysRevLett.113.045305}} [http://journals.aps.org/prl/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevLett.113.045305]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Applications ==
The field of atomtronics is still very young. Any schemes realized thus far are proof-of-principle. Applications include:
* [[gravimetry]]
* rotational sensing via the [[Sagnac effect]]
* [[quantum computing]]

Obstacles to the development of practical sensing devices are largely due to the technical challenges of creating Bose-Einstein condensates, as they require bulky lab-based setups not easily suitable for transportation, although creating portable experimental setups is an active area of research.

An '''auto mechanic''' ('''automotive technician''' in most of [[North America]], '''car mechanic''' in [[British English]], and '''motor mechanic''' in [[Australian English]]) is a [[mechanic]] with a variety of [[automobile]] makes or either in a specific area or in a specific make of automobile. In repairing cars, their main role is to diagnose the problem accurately and quickly. They often have to quote prices for their customers before commencing work or after partial disassembly for inspection. Their job may involve the repair of a specific part or the replacement of one or more parts as assemblies.

Basic [[Service (motor vehicle)|vehicle maintenance]] is a fundamental part of a mechanic's work in modern industrialized countries while in others they are only consulted when a vehicle is already showing signs of malfunction. Preventative maintenance is also a fundamental part of a mechanic's job, but this is not possible in the case of vehicles that are not regularly maintained by a mechanic. One misunderstood aspect of preventative maintenance is ''scheduled replacement'' of various parts, which occurs before failure to avoid far more expensive damage.  Because this means that parts are replaced before any problem is observed, many vehicle owners will not understand why the expense is necessary.

With the rapid advancement in technology, the mechanic's job has evolved from purely mechanical, to include electronic technology.  Because vehicles today possess complex computer and electronic systems, mechanics need to have a broader base of knowledge than in the past.

Due to the increasingly labyrinthine nature of the technology that is now incorporated into automobiles, most automobile dealerships and independent [[automobile repair shop|workshop]]s now provide sophisticated diagnostic computers to each technician, without which they would be unable to diagnose or repair a vehicle.

==Education==
===USA===
In the United States, many programs and schools offer training for those interested in pursuing competencies as automotive mechanics or technicians. Areas of training include automobile repair and maintenance, collision repair, painting and restoring, electronics, air-conditioning and heating systems, and truck and diesel mechanics. The National Automotive Technicians Education Foundation (NATEF) is responsible for evaluating technician training programs against standards developed by the automotive industry. NATEF accredits programs in four different categories: automotive, collision, trucks (diesel technology) and alternative fuels. NATEF lists secondary and post secondary schools with accredited programs on their website.

Some mechanics are [[Automotive Service Excellence|ASE]] certified, which is a standardized method of testing skill and knowledge level. While it's not required by law for a mechanic to be certified, some companies only hire or promote employees who have passed ASE tests. The technology used in automobiles changes very rapidly and the mechanic must be prepared to learn these new technologies and systems.  The auto mechanic has a physically demanding job, often exposed to extreme temperatures, lifting heavy objects and staying in uncomfortable positions for extended periods. They also may deal with exposure to toxic chemicals.

The internet is being applied to the field increasingly often, with mechanics providing advice on-line. Mechanics themselves now regularly use the internet for information to help them in diagnosing and/or repairing vehicles. A popular resource for this type of research is the video website [[YouTube]], where professional and DIY mechanics alike film and share their experiences on vehicle diagnostics and repair. Paper based service manuals for vehicles have become significantly less prevalent with computers that are connected to the Internet taking their position, giving quick access to a plethora of technical manuals and information.

==Related careers==
A mechanic usually works from the workshop in which the (well equipped) mechanic has access to a vehicle lift to access areas that are difficult to reach when the car is on the ground. Beside the workshop bound mechanic, there are mobile mechanics like those of the UK Automobile Association (the AA) which allow the car owner to receive assistance without the car necessarily having to be brought to a garage.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.theaa.com/aboutaa/history.html?ico=homepage&amp;icl=aa_history&amp;icc=footer www.theaa.com/about] The AA. Retrieved 21 September 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;

A mechanic may opt to engage in other careers related to his or her field. Teaching of automotive trade courses, for example, is almost entirely carried out by qualified mechanics in many countries.

There are several other trade qualifications for working on motor vehicles, including ''[[panel beater]]'', ''spray painter'', ''body builder'' and ''motorcycle mechanic''.  In most developed countries, these are separate trade courses, but a qualified tradesperson from one can change to working as another.  This usually requires that they work under another tradesperson in much the same way as an apprentice.

Auto body repair involves less work with oily and greasy parts of vehicles, but involves exposure to particulate dust from sanding bodywork and potentially toxic chemical fumes from paint and related products.  Salespeople and dealers often also need to acquire an in-depth knowledge of cars, and some mechanics are successful in these roles because of their knowledge. Auto mechanics also need to stay updated with all the leading car companies as well as new launching cars. One has to study continuously on new technology engines and their work systems.

===Pit crews===
Pit crews for motor racing are a specialized form of work undertaken by some mechanics.  It is sometimes portrayed as glamorous in movies and television and is considered prestigious in some parts of the automotive industry.  Working in a pit crew in professional racing circuits is potentially dangerous and very stressful work due to the tight margins for error, and the potential financial losses and gains by the racing teams, but a pit crew mechanics pay is usually high to reflect the extra skill/stress levels.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4610">'''Automated restaurant''' or '''robotic restaurant''' is a [[restaurant]] that uses [[robot]]s to do tasks such as delivering food and drinks to the tables and/or to cook the food.

==Technology==
{{Expand section|details of technology used, designers, manufacturers, etc|date=May 2014}}
Restaurant automation means the use of restaurant management system to automate the major operations of a restaurant establishment. Even in the early 1970s, a number of restaurants served foods solely through vending machines. Called '''automats''', or in Japan '''shokkenki''', customers ordered their foods directly through the machines. Across Europe, [[McDonald's]] has already begun implementing 7,000 touch screen kiosks that will handle cashiering duties.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cnet.com/news/mcdonalds-hires-7000-touch-screen-cashiers/]&lt;/ref&gt;

More recently, restaurants are opening that have completely or partially automated their services. These may include taking of orders, preparing of food, serving and billing. A few fully automated restaurants operate without any human intervention whatsoever. Robots are designed to help and sometimes replace [[Employment|human labour]] (such as [[waiter]]s and [[chef]]s). Automation of restaurants also allows the option for greater customization of an order.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.dailytech.com/McDonalds+is+Testing+TabletBased+Burger+Customization+at+30+Franchises/article36980.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Bakki showers''' are a type of [[trickle filter|trickle filtration]].

== Origins ==
[[File:bakki1.jpg|Bakki Shower at the koi farm|200px|right]]
First developed by the Momotaro Japanese Koi farm, the bakki shower attempts to simulate natures way of filtering water.  Similar to a mountain stream where water cascades over rocks.

[[Biofilms]] and [[algae]] grow on the rocks and feed on the nutrients in the stream, essentially filtering the water.  In the case of the Bakki shower, ceramic is placed in trays and the water pumped to the top of the filter and trickles through the media, eventually flowing back to the pond.

Momotaro Koi Farms developed the bakki shower with stainless steel trays.  Since that time many "DIY bakki showers" have been designed with variations on them.  Plastic and fiberglass boxes or crates have been used with success.

In all its simplicity there is a lot of higher chemistry going on between the bio film and the water column.  The biochemistry is better explained in this book : ''Biology of the nitrogen cycle'' By Hermann Bothe, Stuart John Ferguson, William Edward Newton&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=qmZDpnV-sYYC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq='Biology+of+the+nitrogen+cycle''%C2%A0By+Hermann+Bothe,+Stuart+John+Ferguson,+William+Edward+Newton&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=P9o68sKkBw&amp;sig=haQeW-hIgGK5iW1Xorib1hKM9J0&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=AnZPTb2hPJP3gAeZ-O06&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=1&amp;ved=0CBMQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false Biology of the Nitrogen Cycle - Google Books&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Advantages ==
The advantages of this type of filtration are:
:Conversion of nitrogenous wastes
:Off gassing of [[Carbon dioxide|CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;]] maintains [[pH]]
:Oxygen is reintroduced

This method of off-gassing and aeration is used widely in aquaculture.&lt;ref name="AES"&gt;[http://aquanic.org/systems/recycle/books.php]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Filter media choices ==

The choices of [[Filter media]] vary greatly. Each filter media has different properties and therefore different performance.  Here are some photos of different types:

'''Bernhard Hassenstein''' (31 May 1922 – 16 April 2016)&lt;ref name=straw&gt;{{cite web|url=https://twitter.com/strawlab/status/722433032377012224|title=Andrew Straw|work=Twitter|accessdate=15 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; was a German [[biologist]] and [[behaviorist]].

==Life and work==
Bernhard Hassenstein was a student of behavioral physiologist [[Erich von Holst]] and one of the leading researchers in the fields of behavioral biology and bio-cybernetics. His scientific work includes substantial contributions to the understanding of motion perception in [[insects]] and [[color vision]] in humans.

From 1939 to 1949, Hassenstein studied biology, physics, and chemistry in [[Berlin]], [[Göttingen]], and [[Heidelberg]]. During his military service in 1943, he met [[Werner E. Reichardt]], who eventually became his academic partner. In 1948, he worked as an assistant at the [[Max Planck]] Institute for [[Marine Biology]] in [[Wilhelmshaven]]. From 1954-1958, he worked at the Zoophysiological Institute of the [[University of Tübingen]].

In 1958, Hassenstein worked with [[physicist]] Werner Reichardt and engineer [[Hans Wenking]] to found the world's first working group on cybernetics at the Max Planck Institute for Biology in Tübingen. In 1960, he was appointed Professor of Zoology at the [[University of Freiburg]].

Hassenstein retired in 1984. He reportedly died on 16 April 2016 in [[Freiburg]], at the age of 93.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://anzeigen.badische-zeitung.de/trauer/traueranzeigen-und-nachrufe/bernhard-hassenstein-prof-dr-dr-h-c|title=Bernhard Hassenstein Prof. Dr.Dr. h.c.|work=badische-zeitung.de|accessdate=15 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Bio-Synthesis, Inc.''' ('''BSI''') is a biotechnology company headquartered in [[Lewisville, Texas]].  It is a provider of custom and catalog peptides, custom [[oligonucleotide|oligo]]s, antibodies, organic synthesis, and analytical services.  Biomedical researchers worldwide in universities, biotech companies, private clinics, and government agencies use products from Bio-Synthesis, Inc. in studies ranging from PCR diagnostics to cancer research and the Human Genome Project.

The DNA Identity Testing Center, a subsidiary of Bio-Synthesis, Inc. (BSI), works with private citizens, legal representatives, and law enforcement providing services in personal and legal paternity tests, family relationship DNA tests, immigration DNA tests, forensic DNA tests, ancestry DNA tests, and identity DNA tests.

== History ==

===1984–1994: Founding===
Founded in 1984, Bio-Synthesis, Inc. was known as OCS Laboratories and was one of the first companies providing commercially available synthetic oligonucleotides to the biomedical research community worldwide.{{citation needed|date=July 2016}}

It was the first producer of commercially available synthetic DNA and became a producer of synthetic peptides in 1985, and became the only company to provide both synthetic DNA and peptide under one roof.  Also in 1985 the process, now known as PCR, was discovered by Mullis ''et al.''  A key activity for Bio-Synthesis was to synthesize large number of PCR primer thus assisting and solidifying the early adoption of this now common and crucial process in biology.

In 1988, Bio-Synthesis helped in the synthesis and characterization of a new class of peptides with novel antimicrobial properties discovered at the NIH. [[File:Bio-Synthesis1.jpg|thumb|250px|border|right|text-top|upright||alt=An early Bio-Synthesis logo, filed 1988|An early Bio-Synthesis logo used from 1988 to 2008]]

In 1989, OCS became incorporated as Bio-synthesis, Inc. and moved its laboratories to Lewisville, Texas.

In 1993, Bio-Synthesis was one of the first peptide synthesis companies to acquire a Finnigan MALDI-TOF mass spectrometer for the accurate quality control of synthetic peptides produced in-house.

In 1994, Bio-synthesis pioneered the use of molecular methods for HLA analysis which is applied in organ matching for transplantation purposes. Later in the same year Bio-Synthesis held the first major HLA DNA typing workshop with the attendance of HLA laboratory directors from around the country in conjunction with University of North Texas in Denton Texas.

===1995–2006: DNA identity testing===
In 1995, Bio-Synthesis, Inc. introduced DNA identity testing to its broad range of molecular diagnostic services.  Today, the DNA Identity Testing Center of BSI uses advanced techniques and automated systems to produce the most accurate DNA testing results allowed by current scientific technologies.{{citation needed|date=July 2016}}  The DNA Identity Testing Center has its own staff of scientific professionals whose focus is to ensure the quality and integrity of all tests and services.{{citation needed|date=July 2016}}

In 2000, Bio-Synthesis, Inc. perform the genetic analysis close to 500 Chinese nationals that were soliciting, under the right of abode, the right to move to Hong Kong by proving that their biological fathers were Hong Kong residents.

===2007–present: Software tools===
In June 2007, Bio-Synthesis, Inc. unveiled a new online software tool called Protein Lounge which brought all of the vital and necessary databases to one place.  The Protein Database contained all of the necessary information for proteins, such as datasheets, reviews, signaling pathway relation, disease relation, sequences, publications and reagent links.  The database offered the most comprehensive gene/protein sequence pages which have all pertinent information needed to analyze any sequence.&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;

In January 2008, Bio-Synthesis, Inc. announced an exclusive scientific collaboration with Dr. Dante Marciani, a world-renowned expert in immune agonists.  The collaboration was focused on proprietary novel glycosides that stimulate innate immunity while taking advantage of the synergistic effects between innate and adaptive immunity.  In addition, the collaboration extended to proprietary compounds that down regulate The immunity, an area of significance in the treatment of chronic inflammatory conditions. &lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;

In May 2009, Bio-Synthesis, Inc. began Mitochondrial, or DNA, testing and offered it commercially.  The DNA Identity Testing Laboratory at Bio-Synthesis, Inc. (BSI) is currently sequencing DNA samples for maternal lineage and criminal investigations.&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;

In February 2010, Bio-synthesis has been awarded a 2-year, $590,000, Small Business and Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase 1 grant from the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID) of the National Institutes of Health (NIH).  The company will use the proceeds to further the development of its proprietary adjuvants or immune agonists that carry in a single molecule the various determinants needed to stimulate both innate and adaptive immunities, causing synergistic effects on T cell immunity.

In March 2010, Bio-Synthesis launched a new custom service, PenetraINS, whereby two different molecules are joined together via selective chemical coupling for the purpose of up or down regulating gene expression in mammalian organisms.

[[File:Alto Horno, Puerto de Sagunto, España, 2015-01-04, DD 91.JPG|thumbnail|Former blast furnace in Port of Sagunto, Valencia, Spain.]]
A '''blast furnace''' is a type of [[metallurgy|metallurgical]] [[furnace]] used for [[smelting]] to produce industrial metals, generally [[pig iron]], but also others such as [[lead]] or [[copper]].  ''Blast'' refers to the combustion air being "forced" or supplied above atmospheric pressure.&lt;ref&gt;See: [[Draft (boiler)]]&lt;/ref&gt;

In a blast furnace, fuel ([[coke (fuel)|coke]]), [[ores]], and [[Flux (metallurgy)|flux]] (limestone) are continuously supplied through the top of the furnace, while a hot blast of [[air]] (sometimes with [[oxygen]] enrichment) is blown into the lower section of the furnace through a series of pipes called [[tuyeres]], so that the [[Blast furnace#Process engineering and chemistry|chemical reactions]] take place throughout the furnace as the material falls downward. The end products are usually molten [[metal]] and [[slag]] phases tapped from the bottom, and [[flue gas]]es exiting from the top of the furnace. The downward flow of the ore and flux in contact with an upflow of hot, carbon monoxide-rich combustion gases is a [[countercurrent exchange]] and chemical reaction process.&lt;ref&gt;[http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1757-899X/150/1/012022/pdf ''Development of heat transfer circuits in the blast furnace, IOP Conference Series: Materials Science and Engineering'']&lt;/ref&gt;

In contrast, air furnaces (such as [[reverberatory furnace]]s) are naturally aspirated, usually by the convection of hot gases in a chimney flue. According to this broad definition, [[bloomery|bloomeries]] for iron, [[blowing house]]s for [[tin]], and [[smelt mill]]s for [[lead]] would be classified as blast furnaces. However, the term has usually been limited to those used for smelting [[iron ore]] to produce [[pig iron]], an intermediate material used in the production of commercial iron and [[steel]], and the shaft furnaces used in combination with [[sinter plant]]s in [[base metals]] smelting.&lt;ref&gt;P J Wand, "Copper smelting at Electrolytic Refining and Smelting Company of Australia Ltd., Port Kembla, N.S.W.", in: '' Mining and Metallurgical Practices in Australasia: The Sir Maurice Mawby Memorial Volume'', Ed J T Woodcock (The Australasian Institute of Mining and Metallurgy: Melbourne, 1980) 335–340.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;R J Sinclair, ''The Extractive Metallurgy of Lead'' (The Australasian Institute of Mining and Metallurgy: Melbourne, 2009), 9–12.&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
[[File:Yuan Dynasty - waterwheels and smelting.png|thumb|250px|An illustration of furnace bellows operated by [[waterwheel]]s, from the ''Nong Shu'', by [[Wang Zhen (official)|Wang Zhen]], 1313, during the [[Yuan Dynasty]] of China]]

{{See also|History of ferrous metallurgy}}
Cast iron has been found in China dating to the 5th century BC, but the earliest extant blast furnaces in China date to the 1st century AD and in the West from the [[High Middle Ages]].&lt;ref name="Golas1999"&gt;{{cite book|author=Peter J. Golas|title=Science and Civilisation in China: Volume 5, Chemistry and Chemical Technology, Part 13, Mining|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=TSiII7s2wLkC&amp;pg=PA152|date=25 February 1999|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-0-521-58000-7|page=152|quote=...earliest blast furnace discovered in China from about the first century AD}}&lt;/ref&gt;  They spread from the region around [[Namur (province)|Namur]] in [[Wallonia]] ([[Belgium]]) in the late 15th century, being introduced to England in 1491. The fuel used in these was invariably [[charcoal]]. The successful substitution of [[coke (fuel)|coke]] for charcoal is widely attributed to English inventor [[Abraham Darby I|Abraham Darby]] in 1709. The efficiency of the process was further enhanced by the practice of preheating the combustion air ([[hot blast]]), patented by Scottish inventor [[James Beaumont Neilson]] in 1828.&lt;ref&gt;Simcoe, Charles R.

=== China ===
{{see also|History of metallurgy in China}}

Archaeological evidence shows that bloomeries appeared in China around 800 BC. Originally it was thought that the Chinese started casting iron right from the beginning, but this theory has since been debunked by the discovery of 'more than ten' iron digging implements found in the tomb of [[Duke Jing of Qin]] (d. 537 BC), whose tomb is located in [[Fengxiang County]], [[Shaanxi]] (a museum exists on the site today).&lt;ref&gt;"The Earliest Use of Iron in China" by Donald B. Wagner in ''Metals in Antiquity'', by Suzanne M. M. Young, A. Mark Pollard, Paul Budd and Robert A. Ixer (BAR International Series, 792), Oxford: [[Archaeopress]], 1999, pp. 1–9.&lt;/ref&gt; There is however no evidence of the bloomery in China after the appearance of the blast furnace and cast iron. In China blast furnaces produced cast iron, which was then either converted into finished implements in a cupola furnace, or turned into wrought iron in a fining hearth.{{sfn|Wagner|2008|p=230}}

Although [[cast iron]] farm tools and weapons were widespread in China by the 5th century BC, employing workforces of over 200 men in iron smelters from the 3rd century onward, the earliest extant blast furnaces were built date to the [[Han Dynasty]] in the 1st century AD.&lt;ref name="ebrey 30"&gt;Ebrey, p.&amp;nbsp;30.&lt;/ref&gt; These early furnaces had clay walls and used [[phosphorus]]-containing minerals as a [[flux (metallurgy)|flux]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.staff.hum.ku.dk/dbwagner/KoreanFe/KoreanFe.html Early iron in China, Korea, and Japan] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070205063947/http://www.staff.hum.ku.dk/dbwagner/KoreanFe/KoreanFe.html |date=5 February 2007 }}, Donald B. Wagner, March 1993&lt;/ref&gt; Chinese blast furnaces ranged from around two to ten meters in height, depending on the region. The largest ones were found in modern [[Sichuan]] and [[Guangdong]], while the 'dwarf" blast furnaces were found in [[Dabieshan]]. In construction, they are both around the same level of technological sophistication {{sfn|Wagner|2008|p=6}}

The effectiveness of the Chinese blast furnace was enhanced during this period by the engineer [[Du Shi]] (c.&amp;nbsp;AD&amp;nbsp;31), who applied the power of [[waterwheel]]s to [[piston]]-[[bellows]] in forging cast iron.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last = Needham | first = Joseph | title = Science and Civilisation in China, Volume 4: Physics and Physical Technology, Part 2, Mechanical Engineering | place = Taipei | publisher = Cambridge University Press | page = 370 | year = 1986 | isbn = 0-521-05803-1 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Donald Wagner suggests that early blast furnace and cast iron production evolved from furnaces used to melt bronze. Certainly, though, iron was essential to military success by the time the [[State of Qin]] had unified China (221&amp;nbsp;BC). Usage of the blast and cupola furnace remained widespread during the [[Song Dynasty|Song]] and [[Tang Dynasty|Tang Dynasties]].&lt;ref name="The Coming of the Ages of Steel"&gt;{{cite book|title=The Coming of the Ages of Steel|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=uMwUAAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA54|publisher=Brill Archive|page=54|id=GGKEY:DN6SZTCNQ3G}}&lt;/ref&gt; By the 11th century, the [[Song Dynasty]] Chinese iron industry made a switch of resources from [[charcoal]] to [[Coke (fuel)|coke]] in casting iron and steel, sparing thousands of acres of woodland from felling. This may have happened as early as the 4th century AD.&lt;ref&gt;Donald B. Wagner, 'Chinese blast furnaces from the 10th to the 14th century' ''Historical Metallurgy'' 37(1) (2003), 25–37; originally published in ''West Asian Science, Technology, and Medicine'' 18 (2001), 41–74.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ebrey, p.&amp;nbsp;158.&lt;/ref&gt;

The primary advantage of the early blast furnace was in large scale production and making iron implements more readily available to peasants.{{sfn|Wagner|2008|p=169}} Cast iron is more brittle than wrought iron or steel, which required additional fining and then cementation or co-fusion to produce, but for menial activities such as farming it sufficed. By using the blast furnace, it was possible to produce larger quantities of tools such as ploughshares more efficiently than the bloomery. In areas where quality was important, such as warfare, wrought iron and steel were preferred. Nearly all Han period weapons are made of wrought iron or steel, with the exception of axe-heads, of which many are made of cast iron.{{sfn|Wagner|2008|p=1}}

Blast furnaces were also later used to produce gunpowder weapons such as cast iron bomb shells and cast iron cannons during the [[Song dynasty]].{{sfn|Liang|2006}}

The Catalan forge was invented in [[Catalonia]], Spain, during the 8th century. Instead of using natural draught, air was pumped in by a ''[[trompe]]'', resulting in better quality iron and an increased capacity. This pumping of airstream in with bellows is known as ''cold blast'', and it increases the [[fuel efficiency]] of the bloomery and improves yield. The Catalan forges can also be built bigger than natural draught bloomeries.

====Oldest European blast furnaces====
[[File:Germany First Coke Blast Furnace Miniature DM.jpg|thumb|300px|The first blast furnace of Germany as depicted in a miniature in the [[Deutsches Museum]]]]The oldest known blast furnaces in the West were built in [[Dürstel]] in [[Switzerland]], the Märkische [[Sauerland]] in Germany, and at [[Lapphyttan]] in [[Sweden]], where the complex was active between 1205 and 1300.&lt;ref&gt;Jockenhövel, Albrecht ''et al.''

Wetterholm, 'Blast furnace studies in Nora bergslag' (Örebro universitet 1999, Järn och Samhälle) {{ISBN|91-7668-204-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; These early blast furnaces, like the [[Chinese history|Chinese]] examples, were very inefficient compared to those used today. The iron from the Lapphyttan complex was used to produce balls of [[wrought iron]] known as [[Osmond iron|osmond]]s, and these were traded internationally – a possible reference occurs in a treaty with [[Novgorod]] from 1203 and several certain references in accounts of English customs from the 1250s and 1320s. Other furnaces of the 13th to 15th centuries have been identified in [[Westphalia]].&lt;ref&gt;N. Bjökenstam, 'The Blast Furnace in Europe during the Middle Ages: part of a new system for producing wrought iron' in G. Magnusson, ''The Importance of Ironmaking: Technological Innovation and Social Change'' I (Jernkontoret, Stockholm 1995), 143–53 and other papers in the same volume.&lt;/ref&gt;

The technology required for blast furnaces may have either been transferred from China, or may have been an indigenous innovation. [[Al-Qazvini]] in the 13th century and other travellers subsequently noted an iron industry in the [[Alborz|Alburz]] Mountains to the south of the [[Caspian Sea]]. This is close to the [[silk route]], so that the use of technology derived from China is conceivable. Much later descriptions record blast furnaces about three metres high.&lt;ref&gt;Wagner 2008, 349–51.&lt;/ref&gt; As the [[Varangian]] [[Rus' people]] from [[Scandinavia]] traded with the Caspian (using their [[Volga trade route]], it is possible that the technology reached Sweden by this means.&lt;ref&gt;Wagner 2008, 354.&lt;/ref&gt; High quality ores, water power for bellows for blast and wood for charcoal are readily obtainable in Sweden. However, since blast furnace has also been invented independently in Africa by the [[Haya people]], it is more likely the process has been invented in Scandinavia independently. The step from [[bloomery]] to true blast furnace is not big. Simply just building a bigger furnace and using bigger bellows to increase the volume of the blast and hence the amount of oxygen leads inevitably into higher temperatures, bloom melting into liquid iron and, cast iron flowing from the smelters. Already the Vikings are known to have used double bellows, which greatly increases the volumetric flow of the blast.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.warehamforge.ca/ROMiron/index.html|title=Adventures in Early Iron Production - An overview of experimental iron smelts, 2001 - 2005, by Darrell Markewitz.

Awty, 'The blast funace in the Renaissance period: ''haut fournau'' or ''fonderie'' ', ''Transactions of Newcomen Society'' 61 (1989–90). 67.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Cistercian contributions====
One means by which certain technological advances were transmitted within Europe was a result of the General Chapter of the [[Cistercians|Cistercian]] monks. This may have included the blast furnace, as the Cistercians are known to have been skilled [[Metallurgy|metallurgists]].&lt;ref name="Woods34"&gt;Woods, p.&amp;nbsp;34.&lt;/ref&gt; According to Jean Gimpel, their high level of industrial technology facilitated the diffusion of new techniques: "Every monastery had a model factory, often as large as the church and only several feet away, and waterpower drove the machinery of the various industries located on its floor." Iron ore deposits were often donated to the monks along with forges to extract the iron, and within time surpluses were being offered for sale. The Cistercians became the leading iron producers in [[Champagne (province)|Champagne]], France, from the mid-13th century to the 17th century,&lt;ref name="Gimpel"&gt;Gimpel, p.&amp;nbsp;67.&lt;/ref&gt; also using the [[phosphate]]-rich slag from their furnaces as an agricultural fertilizer.&lt;ref&gt;Woods, p.&amp;nbsp;35.&lt;/ref&gt;

Archaeologists are still discovering the extent of Cistercian technology.&lt;ref name="Woods36"&gt;Woods, p.&amp;nbsp;36.&lt;/ref&gt; At [[Laskill]], an outstation of [[Rievaulx Abbey]] and the only medieval blast furnace so far identified in [[Great Britain|Britain]], the slag produced was low in iron content.&lt;ref name="Woods37"&gt;Woods, p.&amp;nbsp;37.&lt;/ref&gt; Slag from other furnaces of the time contained a substantial concentration of iron, whereas Laskill is believed to have produced cast iron quite efficiently.&lt;ref name="Woods37"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=R.

== Origin and spread of early modern blast furnaces ==
[[File:HautfourneauXVIII 1nb.jpg|thumb|Period drawing of an 18th-century blast furnace]]
Due to the casting of cannon, the blast furnace came into widespread use in France in the mid 15th century.&lt;ref name="Tylecote_1992"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Genius That Was China: East and West in the Making of the Modern World|last1=Merson |first1= John|year= 1990|publisher = The Overlook Press|location=Woodstock, New York |isbn= 0-87951-397-7|page=69| postscript = A companion to the PBS Series “The Genius That Was China”}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The direct ancestor of these used in France and England was in the Namur region in what is now Wallonia (Belgium). From there, they spread first to the [[Pays de Bray]] on the eastern boundary of [[Normandy]] and from there to the [[Weald]] of [[Sussex]], where the first furnace (called Queenstock) in [[Buxted]] was built in about 1491, followed by one at [[Newbridge, East Sussex|Newbridge]] in [[Ashdown Forest]] in 1496. They remained few in number until about 1530 but many were built in the following decades in the Weald, where the iron industry perhaps reached its peak about 1590. Most of the pig iron from these furnaces was taken to [[finery forge]]s for the production of [[bar iron]].&lt;ref name="Queenstock"&gt;B. Awty &amp; C. Whittick (with P. Combes), 'The Lordship of Canterbury, iron-founding at Buxted, and the continental antecedents of cannon-founding in the Weald' ''Sussex Archaeological Collections'' 140 (2004 for 2002), pp.&amp;nbsp;71–81.&lt;/ref&gt;

The first British furnaces outside the Weald appeared during the 1550s, and many were built in the remainder of that century and the following ones. The output of the industry probably peaked about 1620, and was followed by a slow decline until the early 18th century. This was apparently because it was more economic to import iron from [[Sweden]] and elsewhere than to make it in some more remote British locations. Charcoal that was economically available to the industry was probably being consumed as fast as the wood to make it grew.&lt;ref&gt;P. W. King, 'The production and consumption of iron in early modern England and Wales' ''Economic History Review'' LVIII(1), 1–33; G. Hammersley, 'The charcoal iron industry and its fuel 1540–1750' ''Economic History Review'' Ser. II, XXVI (1973), pp.&amp;nbsp;593–613.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Backbarrow]] blast furnace built in [[Cumbria]] in 1711 has been described as the first efficient example.{{who|date=November 2010}}

The first blast furnace in Russia opened in 1637 near [[Tula, Russia|Tula]] and was called the Gorodishche Works. The blast furnace spread from here to the central Russia and then finally to the [[Urals]].&lt;ref name="dwip"&gt;{{Citation | last = Yakovlev | first = V.

=== Coke blast furnaces ===

[[File:THC 2003.902.116 Charging the Experimental Blast Furnace.tif|thumb|right | Charging the experimental blast furnace, Fixed Nitrogen Research Laboratory, 1930]]

In 1709, at [[Coalbrookdale]] in Shropshire, England, [[Abraham Darby I|Abraham Darby]] began to fuel a blast furnace with [[coke (fuel)|coke]] instead of [[charcoal]].  Coke's initial advantage was its lower cost, mainly because making coke required much less labor than cutting trees and making charcoal, but using coke also overcame localized shortages of wood, especially in Britain and on the Continent.  Metallurgical grade coke will bear heavier weight than charcoal, allowing larger furnaces.&lt;ref name="Landes_1969"&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;  A disadvantage is that coke contains more impurities than charcoal, with sulfur being especially detrimental to the iron's quality.  Coke's impurities were more of a problem before hot blast reduced the amount of coke required and before furnace temperatures were hot enough to make slag from limestone free flowing.  (Limestone ties up sulfur.  Manganese may also be added to tie up sulfur).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=A History of Metallurgy, Second Edition |last=Tylecote |first=R.

Coke iron was initially only used for [[foundry]] work, making pots and other cast iron goods. Foundry work was a minor branch of the industry, but Darby's son built a new furnace at nearby Horsehay, and began to supply the owners of [[finery forge]]s with coke pig iron for the production of bar iron. Coke pig iron was by this time cheaper to produce than charcoal pig iron. The use of a coal-derived fuel in the iron industry was a key factor in the British [[Industrial Revolution]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last = Raistrick | first = Arthur | title = Dynasty of Iron Founders: The Darbys and Coalbrookedale | place = York | publisher = Longmans, Green | year = 1953}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Hyde&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last = Trinder | first = Barrie Stuart | last2 = Trinder | first2 = Barrie | title = The Industrial Revolution in Shropshire | place = Chichester | publisher = Phillimore | year = 2000 | isbn = 1-86077-133-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; Darby's original blast furnace has been archaeologically excavated and can be seen in situ at Coalbrookdale, part of the [[Ironbridge Gorge]] Museums. Cast iron from the furnace was used to make girders for the world's first iron bridge in 1779. [[The Iron Bridge]] crosses the [[River Severn]] at Coalbrookdale and remains in use for pedestrians.

===Steam-powered blast===
The steam engine was applied to power blast air, overcoming a shortage of water power in areas where coal and iron ore were located.  The cast iron blowing cylinder was developed in 1768 to replace the leather bellows, which wore out quickly. The steam engine and cast iron blowing cylinder led to a large increase in British iron production in the late 18th century.&lt;ref name="Tylecote_1992"/&gt;

===Hot blast===
Hot Blast was the single most important advance in fuel efficiency of the blast furnace and was one of the most important technologies developed during the [[Industrial Revolution]].&lt;ref&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Hot blast]] was patented by [[James Beaumont Neilson]] at [[Wilsontown Ironworks]] in Scotland in 1828.  Within a few years of the introduction, hot blast was developed to the point where fuel consumption was cut by one-third using coke or two-thirds using coal, while furnace capacity was also significantly increased.  Within a few decades, the practice was to have a "stove" as large as the furnace next to it into which the waste gas (containing CO) from the furnace was directed and burnt. The resultant heat was used to preheat the air blown into the furnace.&lt;ref name="Neilson"&gt;Birch, pp.&amp;nbsp;181–9.&lt;/ref&gt;

Hot blast enabled the use of raw [[anthracite]] coal, which was difficult to light, to the blast furnace.  Anthracite was first tried successfully by George Crane at [[Ynyscedwyn Ironworks]] in south Wales in 1837.&lt;ref&gt;Hyde, p.&amp;nbsp;159.&lt;/ref&gt; It was taken up in America by the [[Lehigh Crane Iron Company]] at [[Catasauqua, Pennsylvania]], in 1839.  Anthracite use declined when very high capacity blast furnaces requiring coke were built in the 1870s.

===Modern furnaces===

====Iron blast furnaces====
The blast furnace remains an important part of modern iron production. Modern furnaces are highly efficient, including [[Cowper stove]]s to [[hot blast|pre-heat]] the blast air and employ recovery systems to extract the heat from the hot gases exiting the furnace. Competition in industry drives higher production rates. The largest blast furnaces have a volume around {{convert|5580|m3|cuft|abbr=on}}&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|title=Only together we shall susseed! |url=http://www.madeinua.info/view.aspx?type=ja&amp;lang=2&amp;jaid=261 |accessdate=2008-05-20 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090201162239/http://www.madeinua.info/view.aspx?type=ja&amp;lang=2&amp;jaid=261 |archivedate=1 February 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and can produce around {{convert|80,000|t}} of iron per week.{{update inline|date=May 2013}}

This is a great increase from the typical 18th-century furnaces, which averaged about {{convert|360|t}} per year. Variations of the blast furnace, such as the Swedish electric blast furnace, have been developed in countries which have no native coal resources.

====Lead blast furnaces====

Blast furnaces are currently rarely used in copper smelting, but modern lead smelting blast furnaces are much shorter than iron blast furnaces and are rectangular in shape.&lt;ref name = "Sinclair75"&gt;R J Sinclair, ''The Extractive Metallurgy of Lead'' (The Australasian Institute of Mining and Metallurgy: Melbourne, 2009), 75.&lt;/ref&gt; The overall shaft height is around 5 to 6 m.&lt;ref name = "Sinclair77"&gt;R J Sinclair, ''The Extractive Metallurgy of Lead'' (The Australasian Institute of Mining and Metallurgy: Melbourne, 2009), 77.&lt;/ref&gt; Modern lead blast furnaces are constructed using water-cooled steel or copper jackets for the walls, and have no refractory linings in the side walls.&lt;ref name = "Sinclair75"/&gt; The base of the furnace is a hearth of [[Fire brick|refractory material]] (bricks or castable refractory).&lt;ref name = "Sinclair75"/&gt; Lead blast furnaces are often open-topped rather than having the charging bell used in iron blast furnaces.&lt;ref&gt;R J Sinclair, ''The Extractive Metallurgy of Lead'' (The Australasian Institute of Mining and Metallurgy: Melbourne, 2009), 76.&lt;/ref&gt;

The blast furnace used at the [[Nyrstar]] [[Port Pirie]] lead smelter differs from most other lead blast furnaces in that it has a double row of tuyeres rather than the single row normally used.&lt;ref name = "Sinclair77"/&gt; The lower shaft of the furnace has a chair shape with the lower part of the shaft being narrower than the upper.&lt;ref name = "Sinclair77"/&gt; The lower row of tuyeres being located in the narrow part of the shaft.&lt;ref name = "Sinclair77"/&gt; This allows the upper part of the shaft to be wider than the standard.&lt;ref name = "Sinclair77"/&gt;

====Zinc blast furnaces (Imperial Smelting Furnaces)====

The blast furnaces used in the [[Zinc smelting#Blast furnace process (Imperial Smelting Process)|Imperial Smelting Process]] ("ISP") were developed from the standard lead blast furnace, but are fully sealed.&lt;ref name = "Sinclair89"&gt;R J Sinclair, ''The Extractive Metallurgy of Lead'' (The Australasian Institute of Mining and Metallurgy: Melbourne, 2009), 89.&lt;/ref&gt; This is because the zinc produced by these furnaces is recovered as metal from the vapor phase, and the presence of oxygen in the off-gas would result in the formation of zinc oxide.&lt;ref name = "Sinclair89"/&gt;

Blast furnaces used in the ISP have a more intense operation than standard lead blast furnaces, with higher air blast rates per m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; of hearth area and a higher coke consumption.&lt;ref name = "Sinclair89"/&gt;

Zinc production with the ISP is more expensive than with [[Zinc smelting#Electrolysis process|electrolytic zinc]] plants, so several smelters operating this technology have closed in recent years.&lt;ref&gt;R J Sinclair, ''The Extractive Metallurgy of Lead'' (The Australasian Institute of Mining and Metallurgy: Melbourne, 2009), 90.&lt;/ref&gt; However, ISP furnaces have the advantage of being able to treat zinc concentrates containing higher levels of lead than can electrolytic zinc plants.&lt;ref name = "Sinclair89"/&gt;

Modern furnaces are equipped with an array of supporting facilities to increase efficiency, such as ore storage yards where barges are unloaded. The raw materials are transferred to the stockhouse complex by ore bridges, or [[Hopper car|rail hopper]]s and [[Railcar|ore transfer cars]]. Rail-mounted scale cars or computer controlled weight hoppers weigh out the various raw materials to yield the desired hot metal and slag chemistry. The raw materials are brought to the top of the blast furnace via a [[skip (container)|skip]] car powered by winches or conveyor belts.&lt;ref name="AISI"&gt;American Iron and Steel Institute (2005). [https://web.archive.org/web/20070510164459/http://www.steel.org/AM/Template.cfm?Section=Home&amp;template=%2FCM%2FHTMLDisplay.cfm&amp;ContentID=5433 How a Blast Furnace Works]. steel.org.&lt;/ref&gt;

There are different ways in which the raw materials are charged into the blast furnace. Some blast furnaces use a "double bell" system where two "bells" are used to control the entry of raw material into the blast furnace. The purpose of the two bells is to minimize the loss of hot gases in the blast furnace. First, the raw materials are emptied into the upper or small bell which then opens to empty the charge into the large bell.

These systems use multiple hoppers to contain each raw material, which is then discharged into the blast furnace through valves.&lt;ref name=et/&gt; These valves are more accurate at controlling how much of each constituent is added, as compared to the skip or conveyor system, thereby increasing the efficiency of the furnace. Some of these bell-less systems also implement a discharge chute in the throat of the furnace (as with the Paul Wurth top) in order to precisely control where the charge is placed.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=Whitfield |first=Peter |title=Design and Operation of a Gimbal Top Charging System |url=http://www2.sea.siemens.com/NR/rdonlyres/FFA8AF1C-1791-46E8-AA09-917BB28D8701/0/038.pdf |accessdate=2008-06-22 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090305185028/http://www2.sea.siemens.com/NR/rdonlyres/FFA8AF1C-1791-46E8-AA09-917BB28D8701/0/038.pdf |archivedate=5 March 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The iron making blast furnace itself is built in the form of a tall structure, lined with [[refractory]] brick, and profiled to allow for expansion of the charged materials as they heat during their descent, and subsequent reduction in size as melting starts to occur. Coke, [[limestone]] flux, and iron ore (iron oxide) are charged into the top of the furnace in a precise filling order which helps control gas flow and the chemical reactions inside the furnace. Four "uptakes" allow the hot, dirty gas high in carbon monoxide content to exit the furnace throat, while "bleeder valves" protect the top of the furnace from sudden gas pressure surges. The coarse particles in the exhaust gas settle in the "dust catcher" and are dumped into a railroad car or truck for disposal, while the gas itself flows through a [[venturi scrubber]] and/or electrostatic precipitators and a gas cooler to reduce the temperature of the cleaned gas.&lt;ref name="AISI"/&gt;

The "casthouse" at the bottom half of the furnace contains the bustle pipe, water cooled copper tuyeres and the equipment for casting the liquid iron and slag. Once a "taphole" is drilled through the refractory clay plug, liquid iron and slag flow down a trough through a "skimmer" opening, separating the iron and slag. Modern, larger blast furnaces may have as many as four tapholes and two casthouses.&lt;ref name="AISI"/&gt; Once the pig iron and slag has been tapped, the taphole is again plugged with refractory clay.

[[File:Blast furnace tuyeres.jpg|thumb|250px|right|Tuyeres of Blast Furnace at [[Gerdau]], Brazil]]

The [[tuyere]]s are used to implement a [[hot blast]], which is used to increase the efficiency of the blast furnace. The hot blast is directed into the furnace through water-cooled copper nozzles called tuyeres near the base. The hot blast temperature can be from 900&amp;nbsp;°C to 1300&amp;nbsp;°C (1600&amp;nbsp;°F to 2300&amp;nbsp;°F) depending on the stove design and condition. The temperatures they deal with may be 2000&amp;nbsp;°C to 2300&amp;nbsp;°C (3600&amp;nbsp;°F to 4200&amp;nbsp;°F). [[Oil]], [[tar]], [[natural gas]], powdered [[coal]] and [[oxygen]] can also be injected into the furnace at tuyere level to combine with the coke to release additional energy and increase the percentage of reducing gases present which is necessary to increase productivity.&lt;ref name="AISI"/&gt;

==Process engineering and chemistry==
[[File:VysokePece1.jpg|thumb|250px|right|Blast furnaces of [[Třinec Iron and Steel Works]], Czech Republic]]

Blast furnaces operate on the principle of [[redox|chemical reduction]] whereby carbon monoxide, having a stronger affinity for the oxygen in iron ore than iron does, reduces the iron to its elemental form.  Blast furnaces differ from [[bloomery|bloomeries]] and [[reverberatory furnace]]s in that in a blast furnace, flue gas is in direct contact with the ore and iron, allowing carbon monoxide to diffuse into the ore and reduce the iron oxide to elemental iron mixed with carbon. The blast furnaces operates as a [[countercurrent exchange]] process whereas a bloomery does not. Another difference is that bloomeries operate as a batch process while blast furnaces operate continuously for long periods because they are difficult to start up and shut down. (See: [[Continuous production]])  Also, the carbon in pig iron lowers the melting point below that of steel or pure iron; in contrast, iron does not melt in a bloomery.

Carbon monoxide also reduces [[silica]] which has to be removed from the pig iron. The silica is reacted with [[calcium oxide]] (burned limestone) and forms a slag which floats to the surface of the molten pig iron. The direct contact of flue gas with the iron causes contamination with sulfur if it is present in the fuel. Historically, to prevent contamination from sulfur, the best quality iron was produced with charcoal.

The downward moving column of ore, flux, [[coke (fuel)|coke]] or charcoal and reaction products must be porous enough for the flue gas to pass through.  This requires the coke or charcoal to be in large enough particles to be permeable, meaning there cannot be an excess of fine particles. Therefore, the coke must be strong enough so it will not be crushed by the weight of the material above it. Besides physical strength of the coke, it must also be low in sulfur, phosphorus, and ash. This necessitates the use of metallurgical coal, which is a premium grade due to its relative scarcity.

The main chemical reaction producing the molten iron is:

:Fe&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; + 3CO → 2Fe + 3CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;ref name="Formulae"&gt;{{cite web | title = Blast Furnace | publisher = Science Aid | accessdate = 2007-12-30 | url = http://www.scienceaid.co.uk/chemistry/industrial/blastfurnace.html | deadurl = no | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20071217143213/http://www.scienceaid.co.uk/chemistry/industrial/blastfurnace.html | archivedate = 17 December 2007 | df = dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

This reaction might be divided into multiple steps, with the first being that preheated blast air blown into the furnace reacts with the carbon in the form of coke to produce [[carbon monoxide]] and heat:

:2 C&lt;sub&gt;(s)&lt;/sub&gt; + O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sub&gt;(g)&lt;/sub&gt; → 2 CO&lt;sub&gt;(g)&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;ref name="InorganicChemistry"&gt;{{Citation | last = Rayner-Canham &amp; Overton | title = Descriptive Inorganic Chemistry, Fourth Edition | place = New York | publisher = W. H. Freeman and Company | pages = 534–535 | year = 2006 | isbn = 978-0-7167-7695-6 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The hot carbon monoxide is the reducing agent for the iron ore and reacts with the [[iron oxide]] to produce molten iron and [[carbon dioxide]]. Depending on the temperature in the different parts of the furnace (warmest at the bottom) the iron is reduced in several steps. At the top, where the temperature usually is in the range between 200&amp;nbsp;°C and 700&amp;nbsp;°C, the iron oxide is partially reduced to iron(II,III) oxide, Fe&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;.

:3 Fe&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sub&gt;(s)&lt;/sub&gt; + CO&lt;sub&gt;(g)&lt;/sub&gt; → 2 Fe&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sub&gt;(s)&lt;/sub&gt; + CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sub&gt;(g)&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;ref name="InorganicChemistry"/&gt;

At temperatures around 850&amp;nbsp;°C, further down in the furnace, the iron(II,III) is reduced further to iron(II) oxide:

:Fe&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sub&gt;(s)&lt;/sub&gt; + CO&lt;sub&gt;(g)&lt;/sub&gt; → 3 FeO&lt;sub&gt;(s)&lt;/sub&gt; + CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sub&gt;(g)&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;ref name="InorganicChemistry"/&gt;

Hot carbon dioxide, unreacted carbon monoxide, and nitrogen from the air pass up through the furnace as fresh feed material travels down into the reaction zone. As the material travels downward, the counter-current gases both preheat the feed charge and decompose the limestone to [[calcium oxide]] and carbon dioxide:

:CaCO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sub&gt;(s)&lt;/sub&gt; → CaO&lt;sub&gt;(s)&lt;/sub&gt; + CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sub&gt;(g)&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;ref name="InorganicChemistry"/&gt;

The calcium oxide formed by decomposition reacts with various acidic impurities in the iron (notably [[silica]]), to form a [[fayalite|fayalitic]] slag which is essentially [[calcium silicate]], [[Calcium|Ca]][[Silicon|Si]][[Oxygen|O]]&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;:&lt;ref name="Formulae"/&gt;
:SiO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; + CaO → CaSiO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;ref name="form2sci"&gt;Dr. K. E Lee, Form Two Science (Biology Chemistry Physics)&lt;/ref&gt;{{Better source|date=October 2018}}

As the iron(II) oxide moves down to the area with higher temperatures, ranging up to 1200&amp;nbsp;°C degrees, it is reduced further to iron metal:

:FeO&lt;sub&gt;(s)&lt;/sub&gt; + CO&lt;sub&gt;(g)&lt;/sub&gt; → Fe&lt;sub&gt;(s)&lt;/sub&gt; + CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sub&gt;(g)&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;ref name="InorganicChemistry"/&gt;

The carbon dioxide formed in this process is re-reduced to carbon monoxide by the [[coke (fuel)|coke]]:

:C&lt;sub&gt;(s)&lt;/sub&gt; + CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sub&gt;(g)&lt;/sub&gt; → 2 CO&lt;sub&gt;(g)&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;ref name="InorganicChemistry"/&gt;

The temperature-dependent equilibrium controlling the gas atmosphere in the furnace is called the [[Boudouard reaction]]:

::2CO {{eqm}} CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; + C

The "[[pig iron]]" produced by the blast furnace has a relatively high carbon content of around 4–5%, making it very brittle, and of limited immediate commercial use. Some pig iron is used to make [[cast iron]]. The majority of pig iron produced by blast furnaces undergoes further processing to reduce the carbon content and produce various grades of steel used for construction materials, automobiles, ships and machinery.

Although the efficiency of blast furnaces is constantly evolving, the chemical process inside the blast furnace remains the same. According to the [[American Iron and Steel Institute]]: "Blast furnaces will survive into the next millennium because the larger, efficient furnaces can produce hot metal at costs competitive with other iron making technologies."&lt;ref name="AISI"/&gt; One of the biggest drawbacks of the blast furnaces is the inevitable carbon dioxide production as iron is reduced from iron oxides by carbon and as of 2016, there is no economical substitute – steelmaking is one of the largest industrial contributors of the CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; emissions in the world (see [[greenhouse gases]]).

The challenge set by the greenhouse gas emissions of the blast furnace is being addressed in an ongoing European Program called ULCOS (Ultra Low [[Carbon Dioxide|CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;]] [[Steelmaking]]).&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ulcos.org {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081121182534/http://www.ulcos.org/ |date=21 November 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Several new process routes have been proposed and investigated in depth to cut specific emissions ({{CO2}} per ton of steel) by at least 50%. Some rely on the capture and further storage (CCS) of {{CO2}}, while others choose decarbonizing iron and steel production, by turning to hydrogen, electricity and biomass.&lt;ref&gt;ICIT-Revue de Métallurgie, September and October issues, 2009&lt;/ref&gt; In the nearer term, a technology that incorporates CCS into the blast furnace process itself and is called the Top-Gas Recycling Blast Furnace is under development, with a scale-up to a commercial size blast furnace under way. The technology should be fully demonstrated by the end of the 2010s, in line with the timeline set, for example, by the EU to cut emissions significantly. Broad deployment could take place from 2020 on. {{citation needed|date=April 2017}}

==Manufacture of stone wool==
Stone wool or [[Mineral wool|rock wool]] is a spun mineral [[fibre]] used as an [[Thermal insulation|insulation]] product and in [[hydroponic]]s. It is manufactured in a blast furnace fed with diabase rock which contains very low levels of metal oxides. The resultant slag is drawn off and spun to form the rock wool product.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20100210081645/http://www.rockwool.co.uk/about%2Brockwool/what%2Bis%2Bstone%2Bwool-c7- What is stone wool?] rockwool.co.uk&lt;/ref&gt; Very small amounts of metals are also produced which are an unwanted [[by-product]] and run to waste.

==Decommissioned blast furnaces as museum sites==
{{main article|List of preserved historic blast furnaces}}
For a long time, it was normal procedure for a decommissioned blast furnace to be demolished and either be replaced with a newer, improved one, or to have the entire site demolished to make room for follow-up use of the area. In recent decades, several countries have realized the value of blast furnaces as a part of their industrial history. Rather than being demolished, abandoned steel mills were turned into museums or integrated into multi-purpose parks. The largest number of preserved historic blast furnaces exists in Germany; other such sites exist in Spain, France, the [[Czech Republic]], Japan, [[Luxembourg]], [[Poland]], [[Romania]], [[Mexico]], [[Russia]] and the United States.

== Gas cleaning systems ==
The blast furnace gas can be used to generate heat. So by reducing the constituents in blast furnace gas we can increase the calorific value and can be used to generate heat and rise the temperature in any furnace.

The gas cleaning system contains two stages, the coarse cleaning system and the fine cleaning system.

In the coarse cleaning system a dust catcher is used. A dust catcher is a cylindrical steel structure with conical top and bottom sections. It is also lined with refractory bricks.

[[File:Dust catcher drawing.png|thumb]]

The principle of the dust catcher is that the dust-laden gas is given a sudden reverse in speed and direction. Because of their mass, the coarse dust particles cannot change their velocity easily, and hence settle to the bottom.

==Education and career==
[[File:ClayShirkyJI1.jpg|thumb|[[Photograph]] of Shirky taken by [[Creative Commons]] [[chairman]] and [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology|MIT]] [[MIT Media Lab|Media Laboratory]] director [[Joi Ito]].]]
After graduating from [[Yale University]] with a [[Bachelor of Arts]] degree in fine art in 1986, he moved to New York.&lt;ref name="web.archive.org"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.shirky.com/Frames/cv.html |title=Clay Shirky's Resume |accessdate=2010-08-21 |work=Internet Archive Wayback Machine |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/19990421123028/http://www.shirky.com/Frames/cv.html |archivedate=1999-04-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the 1990s he founded the Hard Place Theater, a [[theater|theatre company]] that produced [[non-fiction]] theater using only found materials such as government documents, transcripts and cultural records&lt;ref name="web.archive.org" /&gt; and also worked as a [[lighting designer]] for other theater and dance companies, including [[the Wooster Group]], [[Elevator Repair Service]] and Dana Reitz.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.location1.org/clay-shirky/ |title=Clay Shirky, Creative Advisor + Technology Consultant |accessdate=2010-08-21 |work=Location One}}&lt;/ref&gt; During this time, Shirky was vice-president of the New York chapter of the [[Electronic Frontier Foundation]], and wrote technology guides for [[Ziff Davis]]. He appeared as an expert witness on [[cyberculture]] in ''Shea v. Reno'', a case cited in the [[Supreme Court of the United States|U. S. Supreme Court]]'s decision to strike down the [[Communications Decency Act]] in 1996.

Shirky was the first Professor of [[New Media]] in the Media Studies department at [[Hunter College]], where he developed the [[Master of Fine Arts|MFA]] in Integrated Media Arts program.

In the Fall of 2010, Shirky was a visiting Morrow Lecturer at [[Harvard University]]'s [[John F. Kennedy School of Government]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.hks.harvard.edu/about/faculty-staff-directory/clay-shirky/ |title=Harvard Kennedy School – Clay Shirky |publisher=Hks.harvard.edu |date= |accessdate=2011-06-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; instructing a course titled: "New Media and Public Action".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.hks.harvard.edu/degrees/teaching-courses/course-listing/dpi-680 |title=Harvard Kennedy School – New Media and Public Action |publisher=Hks.harvard.edu |date= |accessdate=2011-06-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Views==
In his book ''[[Here Comes Everybody]]'', Shirky explains how he has long spoken in favor of [[crowdsourcing]] and collaborative efforts online. He uses the phrase "the Internet runs on love" to describe the nature of such collaborations.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.shirky.com/herecomeseverybody/2008/02/supernova-talk-the-internet-runs-on-love.html The Internet Runs on Love: Here Comes Everybody] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080313232735/http://www.shirky.com/herecomeseverybody/2008/02/supernova-talk-the-internet-runs-on-love.html |date=2008-03-13 }}, SuperNova Talk&lt;/ref&gt;  In the book, he  discusses the ways in which the action of a group adds up to something more than just aggregated individual action borrowing the phrase "more is different" from physicist [[Philip Warren Anderson]].

Shirky asserts that collaborative crowdsourced work results from "a successful fusion  of a plausible promise, an effective tool, and an acceptable bargain with the users." He states that the promise of what the user will get out of participating in a project leads to a person's desire to get involved. Collaborators will then choose the best social networking tool to do the job. One that "must be designed to fit the job being done, and it must help people do something they actually want to do." The bargain, Shirky states, defines what collaborators expect from each other's participation in the project.&lt;ref name="Shirky 2008 260–277"&gt;{{cite book |last=Shirky |first=Clay |title=Here Comes Everybody |year=2008 |publisher=Penguin Books |location=US |isbn=9780143114949 |pages=260–277}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Shirky's 'Promise, Tool, Bargain' premise restates aspects of the [[uses and gratifications theory|Uses and Gratifications Theory]] of mass media research.

He points to four key steps. The first is sharing, a sort of “me-first collaboration” in which the social effects are aggregated after the fact; people share links, [[Uniform Resource Locator|URLs]], tags, and eventually come together around a type. This type of sharing is a reverse of the so-called old order of sharing, where participants congregate first and then share (examples include [[Flickr]], and [[Delicious (website)|Delicious]]). The second is conversation, that is, the synchronization of people with each other and the coming together to learn more about something and to get better at it. The third is collaboration, in which a group forms under the purpose of some common effort. It requires a division of labor, and teamwork. It can often be characterized by people wanting to fix a market failure, and is motivated by increasing accessibility.

The fourth and final step is [[collective action]], which Shirky says is “mainly still in the future.” The key point about collective action is that the fate of the group as a whole becomes important.

Shirky also introduces his theory of [[mass amateurization]]:
{{quotation |
: Our social tools remove older obstacles to public expression, and thus remove the bottlenecks that characterized mass media. The result is the mass amateurization of efforts previously reserved for media professionals. }}

Combined with the lowering of transaction costs associated with creating content, ''mass amateurization'' of publishing changes the question from "Why publish this?" to "Why not?"&lt;ref name="Shirky 2008 260–277" /&gt; Tied to ''mass amateurization'' is the idea of ''publish-then-filter'' which is now required due to the mere size and amount of material being created on a daily basis. Shirky calls this ''mass amateurization of filtering'' a forced move. He uses the [[Portland Pattern Repository]], which introduced the [[wiki]] concept that inspired Wikipedia, as an example of this new marriage of mass content creation and mass filtering.

In 2010 Shirky published ''[[Cognitive Surplus: Creativity and Generosity in a Connected Age]]'' which expands on themes introduced in ''[[Here Comes Everybody]]''.  The book follows concepts he introduced in a Web 2. 0 conference presentation April 23, 2008 called "Gin, Television, and Social Surplus",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Gin, Television, and Social Surplus |url=http://www.herecomeseverybody.org/2008/04/looking-for-the-mouse.html |accessdate=20 January 2011 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101016111844/http://www.herecomeseverybody.org//2008//04//looking-for-the-mouse.html |archivedate=2010-10-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; Herein he popularizes the concept of ''cognitive surplus'', the time freed from watching television which can be enormously productive when applied to other social endeavors. Technology has turned many past consumers into producers. This new production capacity, combined with humanity's willingness to share, can change society if applied to ''civic'' endeavors.

Shirky introduces Cognitive Surplus as a continuation of his work in ''Here Comes Everybody''. "This book picks up where that one left off, starting with the observation that the wiring of humanity lets us treat free time as a shared global resource, and lets us design new kinds of participation and sharing that take advantage of that resource."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Shirky |first=Clay |title=Cognitive Surplus: How Technology Makes Consumers into Collaborators |year=2010 |publisher=Penguin |location=US |isbn=9780143119586 |pages=27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Shirky has also written about "algorithmic authority," which describes the process through which unverified information is vetted for its trustworthiness through multiple sources.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20110717202314/http://corp.viewsflow.com/blog/2009/11/16/respect-your-authority/]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Shirky |first=Clay |title=A Speculative Post on the Idea of Algorithmic Authority |url=http://www.shirky.com/weblog/2009/11/a-speculative-post-on-the-idea-of-algorithmic-authority/ |accessdate=18 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Institutions vs collaboration===
In July 2005, Shirky gave a talk titled "Institutions vs collaboration" as a part of TEDGlobal 2005.&lt;ref name=instVScoll&gt;{{cite web |title=Institutions vs Collaboration |url=http://www.ted.com/talks/clay_shirky_on_institutions_versus_collaboration.html |publisher=TED |accessdate=10 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; This presentation reveals many of the ideas and concepts that would ultimately be presented in [[Here Comes Everybody]] and in future TED talks. Shirky compares the ''coordination costs'' between groups formed under traditional institutions and those formed by groups which "build cooperation into the infrastructure."&lt;ref name=instVScoll /&gt; Classic institutions have to create economic, management, legal and physical structures and inherently, by creating these rigid structures, must exclude large numbers of people. Companies like [[Flickr]], however, having built "cooperation into the infrastructure" of their company, do not have to build massive infrastructure nor exclude large groups of potential contributors.

Shirky states that since many social systems follow the [[Pareto principle]] wherein 20% of contributors account for 80% of contributions, traditional institutions lose out of the [[long tail]] of contributors by turning only the few that dominate the distribution into employees. The ''cooperative infrastructure'' model escapes having to lose this resource. Shirky presents an ''institution as enabler'' and ''institution as obstacle'' concept. The relatively small number of high-volume contributors can be assimilated, as employees, into the old-style corporate model and thus can live in an "institution-as-enabler world". The [[long tail]] of contributors, however, who make few and infrequent contributions, see institutions as an obstacle as they would never have been hired, therefore, disenfranchised. Shirky argues that an idea or contribution may be infrequent and significant. Furthermore, all of the [[long tail]] contributors, taken in aggregate, can be substantial.

One pitfall of the "mass amateurs" creating their own groups is that not all niches that are filled will be positive ones; Shirky presents [[pro-ana]] groups as an example. Shirky closes by stating that the migration from institutions to self-organizing, collaborative groups will be incomplete and will not end in a utopian society. Rather, chaos will follow as was created by the advent of the [[printing press]] before it, and that this period of transition will last roughly fifty years.

Shirky claims that our actions and behavior are generated by convenience. Writer and analyst Megan Garber writes: “The more people we have participating in media, and the more people we have consuming it—and the more people we have, in particular, creating it—the better. Not because bigger is implicitly better than the alternative compact, but because abundance changes the value proposition of media as a resource." &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.niemanlab.org/2010/06/clay-shirkys-cognitive-surplus-is-creating-and-sharing-always-a-more-moral-choice-than-consuming/ |title=Clay Shirky’s "Cognitive Surplus": Is creating and sharing always a more moral choice than consuming? |date= |accessdate=2014-06-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Jay Baer by making collaboration more convenient for the user, it will eventually become a more commonplace. Further, enhancing the outcome of collaboration will instill motivation within the users.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.convinceandconvert.com/social-media-strategy/cognitive-surplus-use-social-connectivity-to-change-the-world/ |title=Cognitive Surplus – Use Social Connectivity to Change the World |date= |accessdate=2014-06-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to [[Audrey Tang]], Shirky has pioneered the notion of a "cognitive surplus", to describe the way that time spent on the internet can have an increasing social value.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/open-source-enlightenment-2015-part-1-audrey-tang&lt;/ref&gt;

===Evolution of asymmetric media===
In June 2009, Shirky participated in a TED@State talk titled "How cellphones, Twitter and Facebook can make history" aka "How social media can make history."&lt;ref name="social media"&gt;{{cite web |title=How social media can change history |url=http://www.ted.com/talks/clay_shirky_how_cellphones_twitter_facebook_can_make_history.html |publisher=TED |accessdate=10 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the talk, he explains that this is the first time in history that communication is possible from many to many. In the past, communication to a large group excluded the possibility of having a conversation, and having a conversation meant not interacting with a group and instead was necessarily a one-to-one structure. Shirky labels this incongruous exchange as asymmetric. In Shirky's view, this feature is one of the main reasons that the internet revolution is different from communication revolutions that preceded it.&lt;ref name="social media" /&gt;

The second difference between the twentieth and twenty-first century communication revolution, Shirky states, is now all media is digitized. This means that the Internet now encapsulates all forms of media from the past and the medium itself has become the site of exchange, not just a means of exchange.

Finally, the Internet allows people to create content, thus the line between producers and consumers has become blurred. As Shirky puts it, "Every time a new consumer joins this media landscape, a new producer joins as well."&lt;ref name="social media" /&gt; Even countries like China, as Shirky gives as an example, go to great lengths to control information exchange on the Internet but are having trouble as the "amateurization" of media creation has effectively turned every owner of a cellphone and Twitter account into a journalist. The populace as a whole, Shirky claims, is a force much harder to control than a handful of professional news sources. He compares the "Great Firewall of China" to the [[Maginot Line]] as both were built to protect from external threats but that is not where the majority of content is being created in this new media landscape.

As an example of the potential of this two-way, collaborative environment Shirky believes we are now living in, he presents as a case study MyBarackObama.com. Over the issue of the [[Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act]], members of the website were upset over Obama's announcement that he was changing his stance and that now he was going to sign the bill "that granted immunity for possibly warrantless spying on American persons."&lt;ref name="social media" /&gt; Despite the disagreement between the President and the posters opposed to his altered view, Shirky cites the mere fact that the President posted a reply to their concerns, instead of persecuting/ignoring the group, as hope for the future of this new form of mass media.

===Shirky principle===
In April 2010, [[Kevin Kelly (editor)|Kevin Kelly]] cited the phrase "Institutions will try to preserve the problem to which they are the solution", and called it the "Shirky Principle", as the phrasing reminded him of the clarity of the [[Peter Principle]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.kk.org/thetechnium/archives/2010/04/the_shirky_prin.php |title=The Shirky Principle |author=Kevin Kelly |work=The Technium |date=2010-04-02 |accessdate=2010-04-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.techdirt.com/articles/20100404/2112388868.shtml |title=Institutions Will Seek To Preserve The Problem For Which They Are The Solution |author=Mike Masnick |work=Techdirt |date=2010-04-09 |accessdate=2010-04-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://prawfsblawg.blogs.com/prawfsblawg/2010/04/the-shirky-principle.html |title=The Shirky Principle |author=James Grimmelmann |work=PrawfsBlawg |date=2010-04-09 |accessdate=2010-04-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Communal value vs civic value===
In June 2010, Shirky participated in TED@Cannes wherein he spoke about ''cognitive surplus'' and its role furthering ''communal'' and ''civic value''.&lt;ref name="Cognitive Surplus"&gt;{{cite web |title=How Cognitive Surplus Will Change The World |url=http://www.ted.com/talks/clay_shirky_how_cognitive_surplus_will_change_the_world.html |publisher=TED |accessdate=10 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The talk was titled, "How cognitive surplus will change the world," and the possibility for change, which Shirky presents, runs the spectrum at one end with ''communal value'' being increased and at the other end with ''civic value'' being furthered. Digital technology has allowed human generosity and "the world's free time and talents," which Shirky calls ''cognitive surplus'', to combine and create a new form of creative expression. This creative expression can take the form of [[lolcats]] or endeavors such as [[Ushahidi]]; the former Shirky says increases ''communal value'', "it is created by the participants for each other" for simple amusement, whereas the latter he cites furthers ''civic value'' meaning the group action is taken to benefit society as a whole.

Shirky then presents the view that society lives under ''social constraint'' and that these ''social constraints'' can create a culture that is "more generous than" the environment created by ''contractual constraints'' alone.&lt;ref name="Cognitive Surplus" /&gt; Understanding where the economic or ''contractual'' motivation of a situation ends and where the ''social'' part begins, Shirky claims is key when designing to maximize generosity. This being the case, to have society use its "trillion hours a year of participatory value" to advance ''civic value'', society itself simply needs to prize, and collectively praise, endeavors like [[Ushahidi]].

Clay Shirky wrote an essay about the aspects of online community building through broadcast media. As members of a broad social community and users of media outlets, Shirky suggests ways in which we can  build up this type of society.

Shirky suggests five different things to think about when dealing with broadcast media outlets:
Audiences are built. Communities grow.
Communities face a tradeoff between size and focus.
Participation matters more than quality.
You may own the software, but the community owns itself.
The community will want to build. Help it, or at least let it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://shirky.com/writings/broadcast_and_community.html |title=Broadcast Institutions, Community Values |date= |accessdate=2014-06-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Response to Evgeny Morozov on consulting for the Libyan government===
In March 2011, Shirky responded to questions raised by [[Evgeny Morozov]] about consulting he had done for the Libyan government. Morozov tweeted "With Clay Shirky consulting the Libyan govt, it's now clear why dictators are so smart about the Web".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://twitter.com/evgenymorozov/status/13135133749 |title=Evgeny Morozov on Twitter |work=Twitter}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Shirky explained he had been invited in 2007 to speak in Boston to Libya's IT Minister.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.shirky.com/weblog/2011/03/consulting-with-libya-in-2007/ |title=Consulting with Libya in 2007 |author=Clay Shirky |work=Clay Shirky |date=2011-03-01 |accessdate=2011-03-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; Shirky stated the talk was "about using social software to improve citizen engagement in coastal towns. The idea was that those cities would be more economically successful if local policies related to the tourist trade were designed by the locals themselves."  Shirky added that nothing came of the project beyond his initial talk.  He defended his underlying desire to expand representative government in Libya and concluded that "the best reason to believe that social media can aid citizens in their struggle to make government more responsive is that both citizens and governments believe that."

===Reaction to SOPA===
In January 2012, at TED Salon NY, Shirky gave a talk titled "Why [[Stop Online Piracy Act|SOPA]] is a bad idea."&lt;ref name=SOPA&gt;{{cite web |title=Why SOPA is a bad idea |url=http://www.ted.com/talks/defend_our_freedom_to_share_or_why_sopa_is_a_bad_idea.html |publisher=TED |accessdate=9 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  He cites SOPA as a way for traditional, mass media producers to "raise the cost of copyright compliance to the point where people simply get out of the business of offering it as a capability to amateurs."&lt;ref name=SOPA /&gt;  After an offending internet site is identified, with the identification process itself not specified in the bill, the targeted site will be removed from the [[Domain Name System]] (DNS). Shirky claims since you can still use the static IP address of the site in question, removal from DNS is futile. He identifies the [[Audio Home Recording Act]] of 1992 as a law that was able to delineate between sharing with your friends as being legal and selling for commercial gain as illegal. Unsatisfied, media companies, Shirky claims, continued to push government to create more sweeping legislation which would hinder any form of sharing. This pressure, in 1998, created the [[Digital Millennium Copyright Act]]. It was now legal for media companies to sell uncopyable material although uncopyable digital material does not exist. To remedy this fact, Shirky states that media companies now tried to break consumer's computer hardware to create the illusion that the media they purchased was indeed uncopyable.
{{quote|The DMCA marks the moment when the media industries gave up on the legal system of distinguishing between legal and illegal copying and simply tried to prevent copying through technical means.}}

Whereas [[DMCA]] was "surgical," SOPA is "nuclear" since the law stipulates any sites pointing to "illegal" content may be censored. Ultimately, Shirky points out the public-at-large is by far the largest producers of content and they are the ones that which will be censured. They will be presumed guilty until they can prove the content they published is not illegal. This turns the American legal system on its head. He closes by encouraging Americans to contact their senators and congressmen and reminding them they prefer "not to be treated like a thief."&lt;ref name=SOPA /&gt;

===Distributed version control and democracy===
On June 29, 2012, Shirky participated in Session 12: Public Sphere of TEDGlobal 2012.&lt;ref name=TED2012&gt;{{cite web |title=How The Internet Will Change Government |url=http://www.ted.com/talks/clay_shirky_how_the_internet_will_one_day_transform_government.html |publisher=TED |accessdate=9 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Shirky made the observation that many of the technological advancements in communication throughout history, from the [[printing press]] to the [[television]], were heralded as harbingers of world peace yet ended up creating greater dissent. "The more ideas there are in circulation, the more ideas there are for any individual to disagree with."&lt;ref name=TED2012 /&gt; However, Shirky claims, with this increased "arguing," comes an increased "speed" of information exchange.&lt;ref name=TED2012 /&gt;  Shirky cites "[[The Invisible College]]" as an example of a group that was able to utilize this effect created by the [[printing press]], via the [[scientific journal]], to help launch the [[scientific revolution]].

He then states we are in a similar period today with open-source programmers and their use of [[distributed version control]] or DVCS. DVCS, he argues, allows for "more arguments" to be made into "better arguments". DVCS also allows for "cooperation without coordination" which Shirky states is "the big change".&lt;ref name=TED2012 /&gt; He then suggests that DVCS fits naturally with law as it, and software development, are "dependency-related." Shirky presents another application for DVCS – drafting legislation. He cites Open Legislation,&lt;ref&gt;"[https://github.com/nysenate/OpenLegislation/ nysenate/OpenLegislation]". [[GitHub]]. Accessed 10 October 2017&lt;/ref&gt; a listing of legislative information from the New York State Senate and Assembly, as an early step in that direction.

The talk culminates with Shirky posing the open question of whether or not government will transition from striving towards one-way transparency to mutual collaboration and suggests if it does, there is already a "new form of arguing" centered around DVCS to aid the transition.&lt;ref name=TED2012 /&gt;

==Description==

The '''Customer Access and Retrieval System''', commonly known as CARS, is one of the many Telephone Company Customer Applications used by [[Mobile network operator]]s, which is mostly used in the [[Western United States]]. The system stores bill and credit information, equipment information, carrier billing information, customer contact notes and payment history. The CARS interface is quite similar to the Billing and Order Support System (BOSS) interface.

==Operation==
User IDs are six characters and normally begin with a 'B' for business. [[Password]]s (usually referred to as lockwords in the western United States) are from four to either characters and must contain at least one [[Alphabetic|alpha]] and one [[Number|numeric]] character. Passwords expire after 30 days. The system also asks for a Project Code (use 'M'), a Group Code (use 'G') and a Position Number. The Position Number consists of a pair of two character fields. The first two characters are the office code and the second two characters identify the individual employee.

[[File:ProjectTinkertoy 047.jpg|thumb|Redesigned for manufacturability]]
'''Design for manufacturability''' (also sometimes known as '''design for manufacturing''' or '''DFM''') is the general engineering practice of [[product design|designing]] products in such a way that they are easy to manufacture.  The concept exists in almost all engineering disciplines, but the implementation differs widely depending on the manufacturing technology. DFM describes the process of designing or engineering a product in order to facilitate the [[manufacturing]] process in order to reduce its manufacturing costs.  DFM will allow potential problems to be fixed in the design phase which is the least expensive place to address them. Other factors may affect the manufacturability such as the type of raw material, the form of the raw material, dimensional tolerances, and secondary processing such as finishing.

Depending on various types of manufacturing processes there are set guidelines for DFM practices. These DFM guidelines help to precisely define various tolerances, rules and common manufacturing checks related to DFM.

While DFM is applicable to the design process, a similar concept called [[DFSS]] (Design for Six Sigma) is also practiced in many organizations.

==For printed circuit boards (PCB)==

In the [[Printed circuit board|PCB]] design process, DFM leads to a set of design guidelines that attempt to ensure manufacturability. By doing so, probable production problems may be addressed during the design stage.

Ideally, DFM guidelines take into account the processes and capabilities of the manufacturing industry. Therefore, DFM is constantly evolving.

As manufacturing companies evolve and automate more and more stages of the processes, these processes tend to become cheaper. DFM is usually used to reduce these costs. For example, if a process may be done automatically by machines (i.e. [[Surface-mount technology|SMT]] component placement and soldering), such process is likely to be cheaper than doing so by hand.

==For integrated circuits (IC)==
Achieving high-yielding designs, in the state of the art [[Very-large-scale integration|VLSI]] technology has become an extremely challenging task due to the miniaturization as well as the complexity of leading-edge products. Here, the DFM methodology includes a set of techniques to modify the design of [[integrated circuit]]s (IC) in order to make them more manufacturable, i.e., to improve their functional yield, parametric yield, or their reliability.

===Background===
Traditionally, in the prenanometer era, DFM consisted of a set of different methodologies trying to enforce some soft (recommended) design rules regarding the shapes and polygons of the [[Integrated circuit layout|physical layout of an integrated circuit]]. These DFM methodologies worked primarily at the full chip level.  Additionally, worst-case simulations at different levels of abstraction were applied to minimize the impact of process variations on performance and other types of parametric yield loss. All these different types of worst-case simulations were essentially based on a base set of worst-case (or corner) [[SPICE]] device parameter files that were intended to represent the variability of transistor performance over the full range of variation in a fabrication process.

=== Taxonomy of yield loss mechanisms ===
The most important yield loss models (YLMs) for VLSI ICs can be classified into several categories based on their nature.
*'''Functional yield loss''' is still the dominant factor and is caused by mechanisms such as misprocessing (e.g., equipment-related problems), systematic effects such as printability or planarization problems, and purely random defects.
*High-performance products may exhibit '''parametric design marginalities''' caused by either process fluctuations or environmental factors (such as supply voltage or temperature).
*The '''test-related yield losses''', which are caused by incorrect testing, can also play a significant role.

===Techniques===
After understanding the causes of yield loss, the next step is to make the design as resistant as possible.  Techniques used for this include:
*Substituting higher yield cells where permitted by timing, power, and routability.
*Changing the spacing and width of the interconnect wires, where possible
*Optimizing the amount of redundancy in internal memories.
*Substituting fault tolerant (redundant) vias in a design where possible
All of these require a detailed understanding of yield loss mechanisms, since these changes trade off against one another.  For example, introducing redundant [[Via (electronics)|vias]] will reduce the chance of via problems, but increase the chance of unwanted shorts.  Whether this is good idea, therefore, depends on the details of the yield loss models and the characteristics of the particular design.

==For CNC machining==
===Objective===
The objective is to design for lower cost. The cost is driven by time, so the design must minimize the time required to not just machine (remove the material), but also the set-up time of the [[CNC machine]], NC programming, fixturing  and many other activities that are dependent on the complexity and size of the part.

===Set-Up Time of Operations (Flip of the Part)===
Unless a 5th-Axis is used, a CNC can only approach the part from a single direction.  One side must be machined at a time (called an operation or Op). Then the part must be flipped from side to side to machine all of the features.  The geometry of the features dictates whether the part must be flipped over or not. The more Ops (flip of the part), the more expensive the part because it incurs substantial "Set-up" and "Load/Unload" time.

Each operation (flip of the part) has set-up time, machine time, time to load/unload tools, time to load/unload parts, and time to create the NC program for each operation. If a part has only 1 operation, then parts only have to be loaded/unloaded once.  If it has 5 operations, then load/unload time is significant.

The low hanging fruit is minimizing the number of operations (flip of the part) to create significant savings.  For example, it may take only 2 minutes to machine the face of a small part, but it will take an hour to set the machine up to do it. Or, if there are 5 operations at 1.5 hours each, but only 30 minutes total machine time, then 7.5 hours is charged for just 30 minutes of machining.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://parametric-usa.com/how-to-design-low-price-machined-parts-and-why/|title=How to Design Cheap Machined Parts and Why? - Parametric Manufacturing|date=3 September 2016|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Lastly, the volume (number of parts to machine) plays a critical role in amortizing the set-up time, programming time and other activities into the cost of the part. In the example above, the part in quantities of 10 could cost 7–10X the cost in quantities of 100.

Typically, the law of diminishing returns presents itself at volumes of 100–300 because set-up times, custom tooling and fixturing can be amortized into the noise.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://parametric-usa.com/quick-guide-cnc-machining-prototype-production/|title=Guide to CNC Machining Prototype &amp; Production - Parametric Manufacturing|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Material type ===
The most easily machined types of metals include [[aluminum]], [[brass]], and softer metals.  As materials get harder, denser and stronger, such as [[steel]], [[stainless steel]], [[titanium]], and exotic alloys, they become much harder to machine and take much longer, thus being less manufacturable.  Most [[List of synthetic polymers|types of plastic]] are easy to machine, although additions of fiberglass or carbon fiber can reduce the machinability.  Plastics that are particularly soft and gummy may have machinability problems of their own.

=== Material form ===
Metals come in all forms. In the case of aluminum as an example, bar stock and plate are the two most common forms from which machined parts are made. The size and shape of the component may determine which form of material must be used. It is common for engineering drawings to specify one form over the other.  Bar stock is generally close to 1/2 of the cost of plate on a per pound basis. So although the material form isn't directly related to the geometry of the component, cost can be removed at the design stage by specifying the least expensive form of the material.

===Tolerances ===
A significant contributing factor to the cost of a machined component is the geometric tolerance to which the features must be made.  The tighter the tolerance required, the more expensive the component will be to machine.  When designing, specify the loosest tolerance that will serve the function of the component.  Tolerances must be specified on a feature by feature basis.  There are creative ways to engineer components with lower tolerances that still perform as well as ones with higher tolerances.

===Design and shape ===
As machining is a subtractive process, the time to remove the material is a major factor in determining the machining cost.  The volume and shape of the material to be removed as well as how fast the tools can be fed will determine the machining time.  When using [[milling cutter]]s, the strength and stiffness of the tool which is determined in part by the length to diameter ratio of the tool will play the largest role in determining that speed.  The shorter the tool is relative to its diameter the faster it can be fed through the material.  A ratio of 3:1 (L:D) or under is optimum.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.efunda.com/processes/machining/mill_design.cfm|title=Milling: Design Rules|first=eFunda|last=Inc.|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  If that ratio cannot be achieved, a solution like this depicted here can be used.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://procnc.com/images/content/Design_Guide_Rev_C.pdf | title=Design Guide | publisher=Pro CNC | accessdate=January 30, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;  For holes, the length to diameter ratio of the tools are less critical, but should still be kept under 10:1.

There are many other types of features which are more or less expensive to machine.  Generally chamfers cost less to machine than radii on outer horizontal edges. 3D interpolation is used to create radii on edges that are not on the same plane which incur 10X the cost.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://parametric-usa.com/1-killer-low-price-cnc-machined-part/|title=The #1 Killer to a Low Price CNC Machined Part - Parametric Manufacturing - CNC Machine Shop + Wire EDM|date=17 July 2016|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Undercuts are more expensive to machine.  Features that require smaller tools, regardless of L:D ratio, are more expensive.

==Design for Inspection==
The concept of [[Design for Inspection]] (DFI) should complement and work in collaboration with [[Design for Manufacturability]] (DFM) and [[Design for Assembly]] (DFA) to reduce product manufacturing cost and increase manufacturing practicality. There are instances when this method could cause calendar delays since it consumes many hours of additional work such as the case of the need to prepare for design review presentations and documents. To address this, it is proposed that instead of periodic inspections, organizations could adopt the framework of empowerment, particularly at the stage of product development, wherein the senior management empowers the project leader to evaluate manufacturing processes and outcomes against expectations on product performance, cost, quality and development time.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Design for Manufacturability &amp; Concurrent Engineering: How to Design for Low Cost, Design in High Quality, Design for Lean Manufacture, and Design Quickly for Fast Production|last=Anderson|first=David|publisher=CIM Press|year=2004|isbn=1878072234|location=Cambria, CA|pages=28}}&lt;/ref&gt; Experts, however, cite the necessity for the DFI because it is crucial in performance and [[quality control]], determining key factors such as product reliability, safety, and life cycles.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Six Sigma Business Scorecard, Chapter 3 - Need for the Six Sigma Business Scorecard|last=Gupta|first=Praveen|publisher=McGraw Hill Professional|year=2006|isbn=9780071735117|location=New York|pages=4}}&lt;/ref&gt; For an [[aerospace]] components company, where inspection is mandatory, there is the requirement for the suitability of the manufacturing process for inspection. Here, a mechanism is adopted such as an inspectability index, which evaluates design proposals.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Stolt|first=Roland|last2=Elgh|first2=Frederik|last3=Andersson|first3=Petter|date=2017|title=Design for Inspection - Evaluating the Inspectability of Aerospace Components in the Early Stages of Design|url=https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2351978917304523|journal=Procedia Manufacturing|volume=11|pages=1193-1199|via=Elsevier Science Direct}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another example of DFI is the concept of cumulative count of conforming chart (CCC chart), which is applied in inspection and maintenance planning for systems where different types of inspection and maintenance are available.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Chan|first=Ling-Yau|last2=Wu|first2=Shaomin|date=October 1, 2009|title=Optimal design for inspection and maintenance policy based on the CCC chart|url=https://dspace.lib.cranfield.ac.uk/handle/1826/4041|journal=Computers &amp; Industrial Engineering|language=en-UK|volume=57|issue=3|pages=667–676|doi=10.1016/j.cie.2008.12.009|issn=0360-8352|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

==Design for additive manufacturing==
{{main article|Design for Additive Manufacturing|l1=Design for additive manufacturing}}
[[Additive manufacturing]] broadens the ability of a designer to optimize the design of a product or part (to save materials for example). Designs tailored for additive manufacturing are sometimes very different from designs tailored for machining or forming manufacturing operations.

In addition, due to some size constraints of additive manufacturing machines, sometimes the related bigger designs are split into smaller sections with self-assembly features or fasteners locators.

'''Entertainment Consumers Association''' ('''ECA''') is a United States-based [[Nonpartisanism|non-partisan]], [[Non-governmental organization|non-government]], [[non-profit organization]] dedicated to the interests of individuals who play computer and [[video game]]s in the United States and Canada.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.theesa.com/facts/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2007-06-28 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070224130217/http://www.theesa.com/facts/ |archivedate=2007-02-24 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Mr. [[Hal Halpin]], a game industry veteran and former president of the [[Interactive Entertainment Merchants Association]] (IEMA) – now called the [[Entertainment Merchants Association]] (EMA) – founded ECA in July 2006. The concept of the ECA was born following an IEMA board of directors meeting, in which Halpin recognized a need for consumer representation.&lt;ref&gt;Gamers On Trial: The ECA's Hal Halpin on Consumer Advocacy, Gamasutra - http://www.gamasutra.com/view/feature/1796/gamers_on_trial_the_ecas_hal_.php&lt;/ref&gt;  The association was launched as a means for consumer rights advocacy following a string of anti-games legislation aimed at criminalizing the sale of certain video games. Although publishers were effectively represented by Entertainment Software Association (ESA) and retailers by Entertainment Merchants Association (EMA), consumers of video games were virtually unrepresented until the launch of ECA.

==Activities==
ECA is an ardent supporter of [[consumer rights]] and [[advocacy]], specifically in defending and advancing the interests of gamers.&lt;ref&gt;ECA Sponsors Regional Chapters to Empower Gamers, GameSpy - {{cite web |url=http://www.gamespy.com/articles/876/876057p1.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2008-06-19 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080526103635/http://www.gamespy.com/articles/876/876057p1.html |archivedate=2008-05-26 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The organization does this through a variety of initiatives including [[netroots]] and [[lobbying]] efforts at the state and national governmental level, an activity permitted by its [[501(c)(4)]] status. ECA also coalition builds with like-minded organizations including First Amendment advocacy groups and parallel trade associations. The ECA is non-partisan and does not support, oppose or give money to any candidates or political parties.&lt;ref&gt;ECA Promotes Politics, but no Candidates, Escapist - http://www.escapistmagazine.com/news/view/81258-ECA-Promotes-Politics-but-no-Candidates&lt;/ref&gt;

The ECA Member division negotiates and offers reduced rates for members with various companies that sell game-related merchandise and services including; magazine and premium website subscriptions, discounts on game rentals and purchases and free or discounted admission to trade shows, conferences and concerts, etc.&lt;ref&gt;ECA Member Benefits, The ECA - http://www.theeca.com/membership_benefits&lt;/ref&gt; They provide programs for reduced-cost medical and life insurance, financial aid, tuition assistance and scholarship opportunities for members as well as career advice, job boards, resume writing aid and discussion forums and boards.

The association distinguished itself early by weighing in publicly on issues that the parallel trade associations did not, including standing in defense of the game [[Mass Effect]] and its developer, [[BioWare]], during the related controversy surrounding supposed sexualization of the product. ECA issued a press statement calling on FOX News to retract the misleading story.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.destructoid.com/destructoid-interview-hal-halpin-71079.phtml   Destructoid Interview: Hal Halpin, Destructoid]&lt;/ref&gt; ECA also was a founding member of the Gamers for Net Neutrality initiative, which sought to educate and empower gamer consumers about the issues surrounding network neutrality as it relates to online gaming. Partnering with MoveOn.org, SaveTheInternet.com, and Games for Change, the coalition provides an educational area on ECA’s website as well as digital advocacy tools for gamers. The association also established several other digital advocacy sub-groups including Gamers for Digital Rights, Gamers for Universal Broadband. Membership is not required to participate in any of the three grass roots initiatives.

On May 12, 2010 the ECA announced that they would be submitting an [[amicus curiae]] (friend of the court) document in support of the gaming industry in the upcoming Schwarzenegger v. EMA First Amendment case. The organization also stated that they intend to amend a consumer petition to their brief to request that the court find that games should continue to enjoy the same First Amendment protections as music and movies and not be legislated and regulated like alcohol, tobacco and firearms.

:The State of California’s case is an appeal urging the Court to adopt a new constitutional standard that would enable states to ban the sale or rental of violent video games for those under age 18. The Ninth Circuit Court previously found that there was no proof that playing such games would cause physical or psychological harm to minors. The appeals court also said the law was not the least-restrictive approach to protecting children from exposure to such games.{{Citation needed|date=July 2010}}

ECA was a coalition partner with Reddit, Google, EFF, Public Knowledge, Major League Gaming, Demand Progress and others in opposing the [[Stop Online Piracy Act]] (SOPA) and its counterpart, the [[Protect Intellectual Property Act]] (PIPA).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.techdirt.com/articles/20111115/15040016780/sopaprotect-ip-would-be-hideously-bad-video-gamers.shtml|title=SOPA/PROTECT IP Would Be Hideously Bad For Video Gamers|website=[[Techdirt]]|accessdate=January 29, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The association also stood opposed to the Copyright Modernization Act ([[Copyright Act of Canada|C11]]) in Canada and the Anti-Counterfeiting Trade Agreement ([[ACTA]]), internationally.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.techdirt.com/articles/20111115/15040016780/sopaprotect-ip-would-be-hideously-bad-video-gamers.shtml&lt;/ref&gt;

==GamePolitics.com==
The ECA merged a number of long-standing staple brands when forming the organization which lent it early credibility and built-in expertise in the respective fields. Among the more prominent brands was [[GamePolitics.com]], a blog originally written and maintained by [[Dennis McCauley]], now run by game journalist Pete Gallagher, the former Editor-in-Chief of [http://www.GameDaily.com GameDaily.com]. GP, as it had come to be known in the business and by the site’s fans, is an information portal for all matters related to game legislation and [[grass roots]] lobbying initiatives.&lt;ref&gt;ECA Acquires GamePolitics, Wired - http://blog.wired.com/games/2006/10/eca_acquires_ga.html&lt;/ref&gt;

The organization also publishes a daily email-based electronic newsletter, ECA Today, which is mailed nightly to all members. The newsletter informs and educates gamers about current and potential anti-games legislation, and acts as a call to arms in the association’s grass roots lobbying initiatives employing [[electronic advocacy]]. ECA also emails out a monthly members-only newsletter which keeps members abreast of the efforts being undertaken and advises the membership of new partnerships and coalitions it has joined. And the final two products are [http://www.GameJobs.com GameJobs.com], an interactive entertainment industry job board, and Video Game Yellow Pages (VGYP), which has served for over ten years as an online directory information for the games business.

==GameCulture.com==
On December 5, 2007 the ECA announced that the association was launching another publication, called GameCulture.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gamedaily.com/articles/news/eca-launches-gameculturecom/?biz= ECA Launches GameCulture.com, GameDaily]&lt;/ref&gt; Journalist and co-author of [[SMARTBOMB: The Quest for Art, Entertainment, and Big Bucks in the Videogame Revolution|SmartBomb: The Quest for Art, Entertainment, and Big Bucks in the Videogame Revolution]], Aaron Ruby, was hired on to be the Editor-in-Chief. The association felt the need to launch the site as a resource for promoting gaming in a more positive light and addressing the ways in which gamers and gaming have impacted broader society. In September 2009, GameCulture added veteran game journalist, John Keefer to its ranks who was followed by New Zealand-based writer, Julie Gray, in January 2010. Popular web comic, [[Experience Points]], penned by [[Scott Johnson (illustrator)|Scott Johnson]], moved from its original home at [[Crispy Gamer]] to GameCulture.

==Controversy==

On December 2, 2009, controversy arose regarding the ECA’s membership cancellation policy, in which the association’s membership terms and conditions were changed without notifying ECA users. The change was made due to an exploit in a partner’s coupon codes. The cancellation policy change temporarily required that members mail a physical letter requesting cancellation while the association upgraded their systems. There were also complaints about the change in the terms and conditions being made without notifying the membership, which struck some members as ironic given the ECA’s stance regarding End User License Agreements.&lt;ref&gt;Chris Walters (December 2, 2009) "ECA Tries To Prevent Members From Canceling." The Consumerist. - http://consumerist.com/2009/12/eca-tries-to-prevent-members-from-canceling.html&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Hal Halpin (March 21, 2008) "EULA Hell."

The three-week ordeal ended on December 24, 2009 once the promised new modules went public giving members online account termination and an online auto-renewal opt-out functionality similar to Xbox Live and ECA’s listing with the CT Better Business Bureau was raised to an A-.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.gameculture.com/2009/12/07/gameculture-exclusive-hal-halpin-eca-head-discusses-membership-complaints&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.escapistmagazine.com/news/view/96652-ECA-Boss-Hal-Halpin-Addresses-Accusations-of-Fraud&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.theeca.com/terms&lt;/ref&gt;

On February 6, 2013, the ECA announced via [[Facebook]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=10151391700673567&amp;set=a.10150315479348567.359981.5941003566&amp;type=1/|title=Please welcome ECA's new Brand Amabassador [sic], Gerard Williams AKA Hip Hop Gamer!| date=2013-02-06| accessdate=2013-02-10|publisher=ECA}}&lt;/ref&gt; their appointment of "Gerard Williams" aka "The Hip Hop Gamer".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Gerard Williams | publisher=LinkedIn | url = http://www.linkedin.com/in/hiphopgamer | accessdate = 2013-02-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; as their video game ambassador.

 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The ECA &amp; 'Hip Hop Gamer Inc' then announced via their Facebook page that all complaints, comments and criticisms should be directed to The Hip Hop Gamer himself and that he did not represent the views of any of their partners or sponsors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Entertainment Consumers Association shared Hip Hop Gamer INC.'s status update. | url = https://www.facebook.com/TheECA/posts/210715412399592 | accessdate = 2013-02-10 }}
&lt;/ref&gt; Gerard Williams then published a video explaining that he had only used the word 'faggot' because someone told him to 'shut up' during a [[Sony]] press event.&lt;ref&gt;

==Support==
The ECA receives financial support from its dues-paying membership – individuals who pay $19.99 annually ($14.99 for students and members of the military). The association claims not to accept funding from industry partners, nor does it permit game publisher advertising on any of its websites or publications, though open job placements on the ECA’s GameJobs.com are paid-for by game industry companies. The organisation also receives additional [[pro bono]] legal assistance from [[Hughes Hubbard &amp; Reed]]. Additionally, the association lists the brands and companies which are marketing partners with the ECA on their website. Most provide discounts and special promotions, but none provide funding.

'''Federation architecture''' is the [[architectural style]] in [[Australia]] that was prevalent from around 1890 to 1915.&lt;ref name=Evans&gt;{{cite book|last=Evans|first=Ian|title=The Federation House|publisher=Flannel Flower Press|location=Mullumbimby, NSW|year=1999|origyear=1986|isbn=1-875253-11-4 |page=8}}&lt;/ref&gt; The name refers to the [[Federation of Australia]] on 1 January 1901, when the Australian colonies collectively became the [[Commonwealth|Commonwealth of Australia]].

The architectural style had antecedents in the [[Queen Anne style architecture|Queen Anne style]] and [[Edwardian architecture|Edwardian style]] of the United Kingdom, combined with various other influences like the [[Arts and Crafts]] style.&lt;ref name=Evans/&gt; Other styles also developed, like the Federation Warehouse style, which was heavily influenced by the [[Romanesque Revival style]]. In Australia, Federation architecture is generally associated with cottages in the Queen Anne style, but some consider that there were twelve main styles that characterized the Federation period.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=A Pictorial Guide to Identifying Australian Architecture |publisher=Apperly, [[Angus and Robertson]] |year=1994 |origyear=1989 |isbn=0-207-18562-X |page=6 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Definition and features==
The Federation period overlaps the [[Edwardian architecture|Edwardian]] period, which was so named after the reign of [[Edward VII of the United Kingdom|King Edward VII]] (1901–1910); however, as the style preceded and extended beyond Edward's reign, the term "Federation architecture" was coined in 1969.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Smith|first=Bernard|author-link=Bernard Smith (art historian)|title=Art historical studies in Australia with comments on research and publication since 1974|date=October 1969|journal=Historical Studies|volume=14|issue=53|pages=90–91}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Federation architecture has many similarities to [[Edwardian Baroque architecture]]; however, there are significant differences that distinguish the Federation architecture style from the Edwardian Baroque architecture style, particularly due to the embracing of [[Australiana]] themes and the use of the [[verandah]] in domestic settings. Australian [[Flora of Australia|flora]] and [[Fauna of Australia|fauna]] are prominently featured, and stylised images of the [[Telopea speciosissima|New South Wales waratah]],&lt;ref name=Fraser&gt;{{cite book|last=Fraser |first=Hugh|author2=Joyce, Ray |title=The Federation House: Australia's Own Style|publisher=Weldon Publishing|location=Willoughby, NSW|year=1989|isbn=1-86302-033-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|page:11}} [[Actinotus helianthi|flannel flower]], [[Stenocarpus sinuatus|Queensland firewheel tree]], and other flowers, and the kangaroo,&lt;ref name=Fraser/&gt;{{rp|page:44}} [[laughing kookaburra|kookaburra]],&lt;ref name=Fraser/&gt;{{rp|page:11}} and [[superb lyrebird|lyrebird]],&lt;ref name=Fraser/&gt;{{rp|page:10}} were common. The Coat of Arms,&lt;ref name=Fraser/&gt;{{rp|page:10}} and rising sun, representing a new dawn in the country of Australia, also appeared regularly on gables.

Many{{citation needed|date=September 2017}} Federation buildings, both residential and non-residential, are listed on the [[Register of the National Estate]] because of their heritage values.

===Gardens and garden architecture===
Gardens of the period were complex and contained many elements—generally a wider variety of plants than is seen in contemporary plantings, pergolas, rose arches, gazebos and summerhouses.&lt;ref name=Fraser/&gt;{{rp|page:82}} Wooden lattice fences were used to partition parts of the garden off, particularly the front from the more private back.&lt;ref name=Fraser/&gt;{{rp|page:81}} Garden paths could be straight or gently curved, and often edged with glazed edging tiles or bricks, and made of tiles, packed gravel or bricks. patterns for brick paving include stretcher bond, herringbone and basketweave.&lt;ref name=Fraser/&gt;{{rp|page:80}} Asphalt and concrete were not used.

Plants were selected to produce year-round colour and interest in the local climate conditions. Initially, evergreen trees were used, but the denseness of shade led to increasing popularity of deciduous trees such as jacaranda, flowering plum and peppercorn.&lt;ref name=Fraser/&gt;{{rp|page:86}} Palms often framed the garden vista, and the native [[Acacia baileyana|Cootamundra wattle]] was popular, as were shrubs such as camellias and standard roses.&lt;ref name=Fraser/&gt;{{rp|page:86}} Conservatories contained begonias and [[adiantum]] ferns.&lt;ref name=Fraser/&gt;{{rp|page:86}}

==Styles==
There are twelve styles that predominated in the Federation period:
* '''Federation Academic Classical'''
* '''Federation Free Classical'''
* '''Federation Filigree'''
* '''Federation Anglo-Dutch'''
* '''Federation Romanesque'''
* '''Federation Gothic'''
* '''Federation Carpenter Gothic'''
* '''Federation Warehouse'''
* '''Federation Queen Anne'''
* '''Federation Free Style'''
* '''Federation Arts and Crafts'''
* '''Federation Bungalow'''

==Residential architecture==
Of the twelve Federation styles, there are four that were mainly used in residential architecture. They are Federation Queen Anne style, Federation Filigree style, Federation Arts and Craft style, and Federation Bungalow style.

===Federation Queen Anne===
The Federation Queen Anne style was designed to embrace the outdoor lifestyles of the Australian people. Most homes have asymmetric gables, white-painted window frames, front verandas with decorative timber features, tiling on the patio floor and entry paths. The brickwork is usually a deep red or dark brown, often with a mix of the two. The roofs are typically terracotta tiles with decorative gables (sometimes adorned with [[finial]]s), motifs, timber features, tall chimneys and [[fretwork]]. Decorative leadlight windows are also common, as are circular windows (known as bulls-eye windows). Federation homes also have decorative internal features in the plasterwork, high ceilings and timber features.

Some outstanding examples are West Maling, Penshurst Avenue, Penshurst, New South Wales; Turramurra Ingleholme, Boomerang Street, Turramurra, New South Wales (former home of architect [[John Sulman]]); and [[Caerleon, Bellevue Hill]], the first Queen Anne home in Australia. The Federation Queen Anne style was the most popular residential style in Australia between 1890 and 1910.

&lt;/gallery&gt;

===Federation Filigree===
The Federation Filigree style is common in the hotter parts of Australia, especially in the north, since it is designed to create shade while allowing for the free flow of air. It is a common sight in Queensland and is sometimes known as the Queensland style. Some outstanding examples are Belltrees House, Scone, New South Wales; private home, Roderick Street, Ipswich, Queensland; and terrace of homes, east side of High Street, Millers Point, New South Wales.

Image:High Street, Millers Point, Sydney, NSW Federation home 0007.jpg|Homes in Federation Filigree style, [[Millers Point, New South Wales]]
&lt;/gallery&gt;

===Federation Arts and Crafts===
The Federation Arts and Crafts style had its origins in England, where architects were reacting to the impersonal nature of the Industrial Revolution. Crafts and handiwork were emphasised to give architecture the "human touch". These influences were absorbed into Federation Australia, where the resulting buildings were generally small-scale to medium-scale and predominantly residential. Outstanding examples are Glyn, Kooyong road, Toorak, Victoria; The Crossways, Martin Road, Centennial Park, New South Wales; and Erica, Appian Way, Burwood, New South Wales.

Image:Burwood_Appian_Way_10.JPG|'St Ellero', 5 Appian Way, Burwood, New South Wales, Federation Arts and Crafts style
&lt;/gallery&gt;

===Federation Bungalow===
The Federation Bungalow style was the Australian response to the bungalow style that was developed in America by people like [[Gustav Stickley]]. It can be seen as a transition phase between the Federation Queen Anne style and the [[California Bungalow]] style that took on later. Stylistically, it exploited the qualities of the bungalow while frequently retaining the flair and idiosyncrisies of the Queen Anne style, although usually in simplified form. Outstanding examples are Nee Morna, Nepean Highway, Sorrento, Victoria; Blythewood, Beecroft Road, Cheltenham New South Wales; and The Eyrie, Fox Valley Road, Wahroonga, New South Wales.

==Non-residential architecture==
Federation non-residential buildings can be in any of the twelve styles. The following gallery shows some examples of non-residential buildings.

&lt;/gallery&gt;

==Federation revival==
{{Main|Revivalism (architecture)}}
During the early-1990s, many of the design elements that characterised the Federation architecture of old were popularised in mainstream architecture. This Federation revival form is also known as "mock Federation" or "faux Federation". The style was widespread within the realm of residential housing (especially in new development suburbs) and for apartment buildings; however, smaller shopping centres and other public buildings also made use of the revival style that retained widespread popularity until the early 2000s. Suburbs of Sydney that developed in the 1990s—such as [[Cherrybrook, New South Wales|Cherrybrook]], [[Castle Hill, New South Wales|Castle Hill]], and [[Menai, New South Wales|Menai]]—are notable in the sense that large tracts of these developments contain almost exclusively Federation revival homes.

The construction of Federation revival architecture varied little from that of other basic styles, with the Federation elements merely forming the facade and decorating elements of the building. For example, the typical brick and roof tile construction, hexagonal [[turret]]s, ornate [[gable]] work, [[finial]]s, prominent [[verandah]], steep pitched roofs, and faceted [[bay window]]s served to parallel the traditional Federation architecture.

A '''glow stick''' is a self-contained, short-term light-source. It consists of a translucent [[plastic]] tube containing isolated substances that, when combined, make light through [[chemiluminescence]], so it does not require an external energy source. The light cannot be turned off and can only be used once. Glow sticks are often used for recreation, but may also be relied upon for light during military, police, fire, or [[Emergency medical services|EMS]] operations.

Several US [[patent]]s for "glow stick" type devices were received by various inventors. Bernard Dubrow and Eugene Daniel Guth patented a packaged chemiluminescent material in June 1965 ([http://patft.uspto.gov/netacgi/nph-Parser?Sect1=PTO1&amp;Sect2=HITOFF&amp;d=PALL&amp;p=1&amp;u=%2Fnetahtml%2FPTO%2Fsrchnum.htm&amp;r=1&amp;f=G&amp;l=50&amp;s1=3774022.PN.&amp;OS=PN/3774022&amp;RS=PN/3774022 Patent 3,774,022]). In October 1973, Clarence W. Gilliam, David Iba Sr., and Thomas N. Hall were registered as inventors of the Chemical Lighting Device ([http://patft.uspto.gov/netacgi/nph-Parser?Sect1=PTO2&amp;Sect2=HITOFF&amp;p=1&amp;u=%2Fnetahtml%2FPTO%2Fsearch-bool.html&amp;r=1&amp;f=G&amp;l=50&amp;co1=AND&amp;d=PALL&amp;s1=3764796.PN.&amp;OS=PN/3764796&amp;RS=PN/3764796 Patent 3,764,796]). In June 1974, a patent for a Chemiluminescent Device was issued with Herbert P. Richter and Ruth E. Tedrick listed as the inventors ([http://patft.uspto.gov/netacgi/nph-Parser?Sect1=PTO2&amp;Sect2=HITOFF&amp;p=1&amp;u=%2Fnetahtml%2FPTO%2Fsearch-bool.html&amp;r=1&amp;f=G&amp;l=50&amp;co1=AND&amp;d=PALL&amp;s1=3819925.PN.&amp;OS=PN/3819925&amp;RS=PN/3819925 Patent 3,819,925]).

In January 1976, a patent was issued for the Chemiluminescent Signal Device, with Vincent J. Esposito, Steven M. Little, and John H. Lyons listed as the inventors ([http://patft.uspto.gov/netacgi/nph-Parser?Sect1=PTO1&amp;Sect2=HITOFF&amp;d=PALL&amp;p=1&amp;u=%2Fnetahtml%2FPTO%2Fsrchnum.htm&amp;r=1&amp;f=G&amp;l=50&amp;s1=3,933,118.PN.&amp;OS=PN/3,933,118&amp;RS=PN/3,933,118 Patent 3,933,118]). This patent recommended a single glass ampoule that is suspended in a second substance, that when broken and mixed together, provide the chemiluminescent light. The design also included a stand for the signal device so it could be thrown from a moving vehicle and remain standing in an upright position on the road. The idea was this would replace traditional emergency roadside flares and would be superior, since it was not a fire hazard, would be easier and safer to deploy, and would not be made ineffective if struck by passing vehicles. This design, with its single glass ampoule inside a plastic tube filled with a second substance that when bent breaks the glass and then is shaken to mix the substances, most closely resembles the typical glow stick sold today.

In December 1977, a patent was issued for a Chemical Light Device with Richard Taylor Van Zandt as the inventor ([http://patft.uspto.gov/netacgi/nph-Parser?Sect1=PTO1&amp;Sect2=HITOFF&amp;d=PALL&amp;p=1&amp;u=%2Fnetahtml%2FPTO%2Fsrchnum.htm&amp;r=1&amp;f=G&amp;l=50&amp;s1=4064428.PN.&amp;OS=PN/4064428&amp;RS=PN/4064428 Patent 4,064,428]). This design alteration features a steel ball that shatters the glass ampoule when the glow stick is exposed to a predetermined level of shock; an example of its use being that an arrow can be flown dark but illuminate its landing location upon sudden deceleration.

== Uses ==

Glow sticks are waterproof, do not use batteries, generate negligible heat, are inexpensive, and are reasonably disposable. They can tolerate high pressures, such as those found under water. They are used as light sources and light markers by [[military|military forces]], [[camping|campers]], and [[recreational diving|recreational divers]].&lt;ref name=Davies&gt;{{cite journal |author=Davies, D |title=Diver location devices |journal=Journal of the South Pacific Underwater Medicine Society |volume=28 |issue=3 |year=1998 |url=http://archive.rubicon-foundation.org/5968 |accessdate= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Entertainment ===

[[File:Ftisland light stick.jpg|thumb|200px|left|The official glow stick of Korean rock band [[F.T. Island]]]]
[[Glowsticking]] is the use of glow sticks in dancing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.glowsticking.com/what-is-glowsticking.html |title=What Is Glowsticking? |publisher=Glowsticking.com |date=2009-09-19 |accessdate=2012-12-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is one of their most widely known uses in popular culture, as they are frequently used for entertainment at parties (in particular [[rave]]s), [[concert]]s, and [[dance club]]s. They are used by [[marching band]] conductors for evening performances; glow sticks are also used in festivals and celebrations around the world. Glow sticks also serve multiple functions as toys, readily visible night-time warnings to motorists, and luminous markings that enable parents to keep track of their children. Yet another use is for [[balloon-carried light effect]]s. Glow sticks are also used to create special effects in low light photography and film.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZgIwVQRzbaQ |title=Jai Glow! PCD vs. Team Ef Em El |publisher=YouTube |date=2011-02-21 |accessdate=2012-12-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Guinness Book of Records]] says the world's largest glow stick was cracked at {{convert|3|m|ftin}} tall. It was created using Plexiglass by KNIXS GmbH (all Germany) in Darmstadt Weiterstadt, Germany, on 29 June 2009.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.guinnessworldrecords.com/world-records/largest-glowstick/|title=Largest glowstick|publisher=guinnessworldrecords.com|accessdate=2016-03-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Operation ==
{{Further|Chemical kinetics}}
Glow sticks emit light when two chemicals are mixed. The reaction between the two chemicals is catalyzed by a base, usually sodium salicylate.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The sticks consist of a tiny, brittle container within a flexible outside
container. Each container holds a different solution. When the outer container is flexed, the inner container breaks, allowing the solutions to combine, causing the necessary chemical reaction. After breaking, the tube is shaken to thoroughly mix the components.

The glow stick contains two chemicals, a base catalyst, and a suitable  dye ([[Photoelectrochemical process#Photosensitization|sensitizer]], or [[fluorophor]]). This creates an exothermic reaction.  The chemicals inside the plastic tube are a mixture of the dye, the base catalyst, and [[diphenyl oxalate]]. The chemical in the glass vial is hydrogen peroxide. By mixing the peroxide with the phenyl oxalate ester, a [[chemical reaction]] takes place, yielding two moles of [[phenol]] and one mole of peroxyacid ester ([[1,2-Dioxetanedione|1,2-dioxetanedione]]).&lt;ref&gt;http://www.bnl.gov/esh/cms/pdf/peroxides.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; The peroxyacid [[chemical decomposition|decomposes spontaneously]] to [[carbon dioxide]], releasing energy that excites the dye, which then relaxes by releasing a [[photon]]. The [[wavelength]] of the photon—the color of the emitted light—depends on the structure of the dye. The reaction releases energy mostly as light, with very little heat.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|title = The Chemistry of Lightsticks: Demonstrations To Illustrate Chemical Processes|journal = Journal of Chemical Education|date = 2012-06-12|issn = 0021-9584|pages = 910–916|volume = 89|issue = 7|doi = 10.1021/ed200328d|first = Thomas Scott|last = Kuntzleman|first2 = Kristen|last2 = Rohrer|first3 = Emeric|last3 = Schultz|bibcode = 2012JChEd..89..910K}}&lt;/ref&gt; The reason for this is that the reverse [[Woodward-Hoffmann rules|[2 + 2] photocycloadditions]] of 1,2-dioxetanedione is a [[forbidden transition]] (it violates [[Woodward–Hoffmann rules]]) and cannot proceed through a regular thermal mechanism.
[[Image:Cyalume-reactions.svg|thumb|center|500px|Oxidation of an diphenyl oxalate (top), decomposition of 1,2-dioxetanedione (middle), relaxation of dye (lower)]]

By adjusting the concentrations of the two chemicals and the base, manufacturers can produce glow sticks that either glow brightly for a short amount of time or more dimly for an extended length of time. This also allows design of glow sticks that perform satisfactorily in hot or cold climates, by compensating for the temperature dependence of reaction. At maximum concentration (typically only found in [[laboratory]] settings), mixing the chemicals results in a furious reaction, producing large amounts of light for only a few seconds. The same effect can be achieved by adding copious amounts of sodium salicyate or other bases. Heating a glow stick also causes the reaction to proceed faster and the glow stick to glow more brightly for a brief period. Cooling a glow stick slows the reaction a small amount and causes it to last longer, but the light is dimmer. This can be demonstrated by refrigerating or freezing an active glow stick; when it warms up again, it will resume glowing. The dyes used in glow sticks usually exhibit [[fluorescence]] when exposed to [[ultraviolet]] radiation—even a spent glow stick may therefore shine under a [[black light]].

The light intensity is high immediately after activation, then exponentially decays. Leveling of this initial high output is possible by refrigerating the glow stick before activation.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.dtic.mil/cgi-bin/GetTRDoc?Location=U2&amp;doc=GetTRDoc.pdf&amp;AD=ADA430634&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Chemoluminescent lightstick spectral curves.png|thumb|right|400px|Spectral emission of chemiluminescence (green line) of mixed fluorophore and peroxide, which was removed from an orange glow stick, fluorescence of liquid fluorophore in glass ampoule only (before mixing) while under black light (yellow-orange line), fluorescence of plastic outer container of orange glow stick under black light (red line), and spectrum of reassembled chemiluminescent glow stick (glowing liquid poured back into original orange plastic vial) (darker orange line). This plot thus shows that the orange light from an orange glow stick (identical to the one in the above glow stick disassembly image) is created by a greenish-yellow light emitting chemoluminescent liquid partially inducing fluorescence in (and being filtered by) an orange plastic container.]]

A combination of two fluorophores can be used, with one in the solution and another incorporated to the walls of the container. This is advantageous when the second fluorophore would degrade in solution or be attacked by the chemicals. The emission spectrum of the first fluorophore and the absorption spectrum of the second one have to largely overlap, and the first one has to emit at shorter wavelength than the second one. A downconversion from ultraviolet to visible is possible, as is conversion between visible wavelengths (e.g., green to orange) or visible to near-infrared. The shift can be as much as 200&amp;nbsp;nm, but usually the range is about 20-100&amp;nbsp;nm longer than the absorption spectrum.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.freepatentsonline.com/4379320.html |title=Chemical lighting device – American Cyanamid Company |publisher=Freepatentsonline.com |date=1981-02-19 |accessdate=2012-12-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; Glow sticks using this approach tend to have colored containers, due to the dye embedded in the plastic. Infrared glow sticks may appear dark-red to black, as the dyes absorb the visible light produced inside the container and reemit near-infrared.
[[File:White glow stick.png|thumb|440x440px|Light emitted from a white glow stick. Four or five peaks are observed in the spectrum, suggesting the presence of four or five different fluorophores contained in the glow stick.]]
On the other hand, various colors can also be achieved by simply mixing several fluorophores within the solution to achieve the desired effect.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Kuntzleman|first=Thomas S.|last2=Comfort|first2=Anna E.|last3=Baldwin|first3=Bruce W.|title=Glowmatography|journal=Journal of Chemical Education|volume=86|issue=1|pages=64|doi=10.1021/ed086p64|bibcode=2009JChEd..86...64K|year=2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; These various colors can be achieved due to the principles of [[additive color]]. For example, a combination of red, yellow, and green fluorophores is used in orange light sticks,&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; and a combination of several fluorescers is used in white light sticks.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

==Safety issues==
In glow sticks, [[phenol]] is produced as a byproduct. It is advisable to keep the mixture away from skin and to prevent accidental ingestion if the glow stick case splits or breaks. If spilled on skin, the chemicals could cause slight skin irritation, swelling, or, in extreme circumstances, vomiting and nausea.  Some of the chemicals used in older glow sticks were thought to be potential [[carcinogen]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.scafo.org/library/110202.html|title=SCAFO Online Articles|author=|date=|website=www.scafo.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; The sensitizers used are [[polynuclear aromatic hydrocarbon]]s, a class of compounds known for their carcinogenic properties.

Dibutyl phthalate, an ingredient sometimes used in glow sticks, has raised some health concerns. While there is no evidence that dibutyl phthalate poses any major health risk, it was put on California's list of suspected [[Teratology|teratogens]] in 2006.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Debutyl Phthalate|url=https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/compound/dibutyl_phthalate#section=Top|publisher=PubChem}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Warnings==
Glow sticks contain ingredients that act as a plasticizer. This means that if a glow stick leaks onto anything plastic it can liquefy it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Everything there is to know about glowsticks…|url=https://www.glowsticks.co.uk/everything-about-glowsticks.html|website=glowsticks.co.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6163">The '''heterojunction bipolar transistor''' ('''HBT''') is  a type of [[bipolar junction transistor]] (BJT) which uses differing semiconductor materials for the emitter and base regions, creating a [[heterojunction]]. The HBT improves on the BJT in that it can handle signals of very high frequencies, up to several hundred [[gigahertz|GHz]]. It is commonly used in modern ultrafast circuits, mostly radio-frequency (RF) systems, and in applications requiring a high power efficiency, such as RF power amplifiers in cellular phones. The idea of employing a heterojunction is as old as the conventional BJT, dating back to a patent from 1951.&lt;ref&gt;W. Shockley: 'Circuit Element Utilizing Semiconductive Material', United States Patent 2,569,347, 1951.&lt;/ref&gt; Detailed theory of heterojunction bipolar transistor was developed by [[Herbert Kroemer]] in 1957.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite article | title=Theory of a Wide-Gap Emitter for Transistors | year=1957 | author=[[Herbert Kroemer]] | doi=10.1109/JRPROC.1957.278348}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Materials==

[[File:Npn heterostructure bands.svg|thumb|Bands in graded heterojunction npn bipolar transistor. Barriers indicated for electrons to move from emitter to base, and for holes to be injected backward from base to emitter; Also, grading of bandgap in base assists electron transport in base region; Light colors indicate [[depletion region|depleted regions]].]]

The principal difference between the BJT and HBT is in the use of differing semiconductor materials for the emitter-base junction and the base-collector junction, creating a heterojunction. The effect is to limit the injection of holes from the base into the emitter region, since the potential barrier in the valence band is higher than in the conduction band. Unlike BJT technology, this allows a high doping density to be used in the base, reducing the base resistance while maintaining gain. The efficiency of the heterojunction is measured by the Kroemer factor.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.scribd.com/doc/60044419/72/The-phototransistor-effect The phototransistor effect]: "The Kroemer factor is a function of the physical parameters of the materials making up the heterojunction, and can be expressed in the following way [formula given]"&lt;/ref&gt; Kroemer was awarded a [[Nobel Prize]] in 2000 for his work in this field at the University of California, Santa Barbara.

Materials used for the substrate include silicon, gallium arsenide, and [[indium phosphide]], while  silicon / [[SiGe|silicon-germanium alloys]], [[aluminum gallium arsenide]] / gallium arsenide, and [[indium phosphide]] / [[indium gallium arsenide]] are used for the epitaxial layers. Wide-[[bandgap]] semiconductors such as [[gallium nitride]] and [[indium gallium nitride]] are especially promising.

In [[SiGe]] graded heterostructure transistors, the amount of germanium in the base is graded, making the bandgap narrower at the collector than at the emitter. That tapering of the bandgap leads to a field-assisted transport in the base, which speeds transport through the base and increases frequency response.

==Fabrication==
Due to the need to manufacture HBT devices with extremely high-doped thin base layers, [[molecular beam epitaxy]] is principally employed.   In addition to base, emitter and collector layers, highly doped layers are deposited on either side of collector and emitter to facilitate an [[ohmic contact]], which are placed on the contact layers after exposure by [[photolithography]] and etching. The contact layer underneath the collector, named subcollector, is an active part of the transistor.

Other techniques are used depending on the material system. IBM and others use [[UHV CVD]] for SiGe; other techniques used include [[MOVPE]] for [[III-V]] systems.

Normally the epitaxial layers are lattice matched (which restricts the choice of bandgap etc.). If they are near-lattice-matched the device is '''pseudomorphic''', and if the layers are unmatched (often separated by a thin buffer layer) it is '''metamorphic'''.

==Limits==
A pseudomorphic heterojunction bipolar transistor developed at the [[University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign]], built from [[indium phosphide]] and [[indium gallium arsenide]] and designed with compositionally graded collector, base and emitter, was demonstrated to cut off at a speed of 710&amp;nbsp;GHz.&lt;ref&gt;12.5 nm base pseudomorphic heterojunction bipolar transistors achieving f&lt;sub&gt;T&lt;/sub&gt;=710GHz f&lt;sub&gt;T&lt;/sub&gt;=710GHz and f&lt;sub&gt;MAX&lt;/sub&gt;=340GHz Hafez et al, Appl. Phys. Lett. 87, 252109, 2005 {{doi|10.1063/1.2149510}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.semiconductor-today.com/features/Semiconductor%20Today%20-%20Transcending%20frequency%20and%20integration%20limits.pdf Indium Phosphide: Transcending frequency and integration limits. Semiconductor Today. Vol 1 Issue 3. Sept 2006]&lt;/ref&gt;

Besides being record breakers in terms of speed, HBTs made of [[indium phosphide|InP]]/[[indium gallium arsenide|InGaAs]] are ideal for monolithic optoelectronic integrated circuits. A PIN-type photo detector is formed by the base-collector-subcollector layers. The [[bandgap]] of InGaAs works well for detecting 1550&amp;nbsp;nm-[[wavelength]] infrared laser signals used in optical communication systems. Biasing the HBT to obtain an active device, a photo transistor with high internal gain is obtained. Among other HBT applications are mixed signal circuits such as analog-to-digital and digital-to-analog converters.

==Pre-history==
Prior to the release of bitcoin there were a number of digital cash technologies starting with the issuer based [[ecash]] protocols of [[David Chaum]] and [[Stefan Brands]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first=David |last=Chaum |title=Blind signatures for untraceable payments |journal=Advances in Cryptology Proceedings of Crypto |year=1983 |volume=82 |issue=3 |pages=199–203 |url=http://www.hit.bme.hu/~buttyan/courses/BMEVIHIM219/2009/Chaum.BlindSigForPayment.1982.PDF |doi=10.1007/978-1-4757-0602-4_18}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|journal=Lecture Notes in Computer Science|last1=Chaum|first1=David|last2=Fiat|first2=Amos|last3=Naor|first3=Moni|title=Untraceable Electronic Cash|url=http://blog.koehntopp.de/uploads/chaum_fiat_naor_ecash.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Chaum |first1=David |last2=Brands |first2=Stefan |title='Minting' electronic cash |url=https://spectrum.ieee.org/computing/software/minting-electronic-cash |accessdate=17  September 2018 |work=IEEE Spectrum special issue on electronic money, February 1997 |publisher=IEEE |date=4 January 1999}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Adam Back]] developed [[hashcash]], a [[proof-of-work]] scheme for spam control.

In the bit gold proposal which proposed a collectible market based mechanism for inflation control, [[Nick Szabo]] also investigated some additional aspects including a [[Byzantine fault tolerance|Byzantine fault-tolerant]] agreement protocol based on quorum addresses to store and transfer the chained [[proof-of-work]] solutions, which was vulnerable to Sybil attacks, though.&lt;ref name="TsoSch2015" /&gt;

The value of the first bitcoin transactions were negotiated by individuals on the bitcoin forum with one notable transaction of 10,000 BTC used to indirectly purchase two pizzas delivered by [[Papa John's Pizza|Papa John's]].&lt;ref name="Wired:RFB" /&gt;

On 6 August 2010, a major [[Vulnerability (computing)|vulnerability]] in the bitcoin protocol was spotted.

===Satoshi Nakamoto===
{{Main|Satoshi Nakamoto}}
"Satoshi Nakamoto" is presumed to be a [[pseudonym]] for the person or people who designed the original bitcoin protocol in 2008 and launched the network in 2009. Nakamoto was responsible for creating the majority of the official bitcoin software and was active in making modifications and posting technical information on the bitcoin forum.&lt;ref name="Wired:RFB" /&gt; There has been much speculation as to the identity of Satoshi Nakamoto with suspects including Dai, Szabo, and Finney{{snd}} and accompanying denials.&lt;ref name="LikeInAMirror1"&gt;{{cite web|title=Satoshi Nakamoto is (probably) Nick Szabo|url=https://likeinamirror.wordpress.com/2013/12/01/satoshi-nakamoto-is-probably-nick-szabo/#%21|work=LikeInAMirror|publisher=WordPress|accessdate=5 December 2013| archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20140413135108/https://likeinamirror.wordpress.com/2013/12/01/satoshi-nakamoto-is-probably-nick-szabo/ | archivedate = 2014-04-13| deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last= Weisenthal |first= Joe |url= http://www.businessinsider.com/did-shinichi-mochizuki-invent-bitcoin-2013-5|title= Here's The Problem With The New Theory That A Japanese Math Professor Is The Inventor Of Bitcoin |publisher= Business Insider| date= 19 May 2013 |accessdate = 19 May 2013 | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20131103105304/http://www.businessinsider.com/did-shinichi-mochizuki-invent-bitcoin-2013-5 | archivedate = 2013-11-03| deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt; The possibility that Satoshi Nakamoto was a computer collective in the European financial sector has also been discussed.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ibtimes.co.uk/bitcoin-creator-satoshi-nakamoto-value-digital-currency-530480 Bitcoin Inventor Satoshi Nakamoto is Anonymous-style Cell from Europe] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131217221103/http://www.ibtimes.co.uk/bitcoin-creator-satoshi-nakamoto-value-digital-currency-530480 |date=December 17, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Investigations into the real identity of Satoshi Nakamoto were attempted by ''[[The New Yorker]]'' and ''[[Fast Company (magazine)|Fast Company]]''. ''The New Yorker's'' investigation brought up at least two possible candidates: Michael Clear and Vili Lehdonvirta. ''Fast Company'''s investigation brought up [[circumstantial evidence]] linking an [[encryption]] [[patent]] application filed by Neal King, Vladimir Oksman and Charles Bry on 15 August 2008, and the bitcoin.org domain name which was registered 72&amp;nbsp;hours later.

Nakamoto's involvement with bitcoin does not appear to extend past mid-2010.&lt;ref name="Wired:RFB" /&gt; In April 2011, Nakamoto communicated with a bitcoin contributor, saying that he had "moved on to other things".&lt;ref name="NY2011" /&gt;

Stefan Thomas, a Swiss coder and active community member, graphed the time stamps for each of Nakamoto's 500-plus bitcoin forum posts; the resulting chart showed a steep decline to almost no posts between the hours of 5&amp;nbsp;a.m. and 11&amp;nbsp;a.m. [[Greenwich Mean Time]]. Because this pattern held true even on Saturdays and Sundays, it suggested that Nakamoto was asleep at this time, and the hours of 5&amp;nbsp;a.m. to 11&amp;nbsp;a.m. GMT are midnight to 6&amp;nbsp;a.m. [[Eastern Time Zone|Eastern Standard Time]] (North American Eastern Standard Time). Other clues suggested that Nakamoto was British: A newspaper headline he had encoded in the genesis block came from the UK-published newspaper ''[[The Times]]'', and both his forum posts and his comments in the bitcoin source code used [[British English]] spellings, such as "optimise" and "colour".&lt;ref name="Wired:RFB" /&gt;

Bitcoin gains more legitimacy among lawmakers and legacy financial companies. For example, Japan passed a law to accept bitcoin as a legal payment method,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first1=Arjun |last1=Kharpal |title=Bitcoin value rises over $1 billion as Japan, Russia move to legitimize cryptocurrency |url=https://www.cnbc.com/2017/04/12/bitcoin-price-rises-japan-russia-regulation.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Russia has announced that it will legalize the use of cryptocurrencies such as bitcoin.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first1=Antonia |last1=Colibasanu |title=Here's why Russia is opening the door to cryptocurrencies |url=http://www.businessinsider.com/why-russia-legalized-cryptocurrencies-2017-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; And Norway’s largest online bank, Skandiabanken, integrates bitcoin accounts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first1=Jamie |last1=Redman |title=Norway’s Largest Online Bank Integrates Bitcoin Accounts |url=https://news.bitcoin.com/norways-online-bank-bitcoin-accounts/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Forks==
{{See also|Bitcoin scalability problem|List of bitcoin forks}}

A [[Fork (blockchain)|fork referring to a blockchain]] is defined variously as a blockchain split into two paths forward, or as a change of protocol rules. Accidental forks on the bitcoin network regularly occur as part of the mining process. They happen when two miners find a block at a similar point in time. As a result, the network briefly forks. This fork is subsequently resolved by the software which automatically chooses the longest chain, thereby orphaning the extra blocks added to the shorter chain (that were dropped by the longer chain).&lt;ref name="coindesk20170327forks"&gt;{{Cite news |url=http://www.coindesk.com/short-guide-bitcoin-forks-explained/  |title=A Short Guide to Bitcoin Forks|author=Amy Castor |accessdate=1 July 2017 |date=27 March 2017 |work=CoinDesk}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===March 2013===
On 12 March 2013, a bitcoin miner running version 0.8.0 of the bitcoin software created a large block that was considered invalid in version 0.7 (due to an undiscovered inconsistency between the two versions).
This created a split or "fork" in the blockchain since computers with the recent version of the software accepted the invalid block and continued to build on the diverging chain, whereas older versions of the software rejected it and continued extending the blockchain without the offending block.
This split resulted in two separate transaction logs being formed without clear consensus, which allowed for the same funds to be spent differently on each chain. In response, the Mt. Gox exchange temporarily halted bitcoin deposits.&lt;ref name="Mtgoxforkchain"&gt;{{cite web|last=Karpeles|first=Mark|title=Bitcoin blockchain issue&amp;nbsp;– bitcoin deposits temporarily suspended|url=https://mtgox.zendesk.com/entries/21477395-Bitcoin-blockchain-issue-bitcoin-deposits-temporarily-suspended|publisher=[[Mt.

Gox exchange but rose most of the way back to its prior level of $48.&lt;ref name="ArsFork"&gt;{{cite web|last=Lee|first=Timothy|title=Major glitch in Bitcoin network sparks sell-off; price temporarily falls 23%|url=https://arstechnica.com/business/2013/03/major-glitch-in-bitcoin-network-sparks-sell-off-price-temporarily-falls-23/|publisher=Ars Technica|date=12 March 2013 | archiveurl = https://www.webcitation.org/6G4e02Xd1 | archivedate = 2013-04-22| deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="VergeFork"&gt;{{cite web|last=Blagdon|first=Jeff|title=Technical problems cause Bitcoin to plummet from record high, Mt.

Miners resolved the split by downgrading to version 0.7, putting them back on track with the canonical blockchain.
User funds largely remained unaffected and were available when network consensus was restored.&lt;ref name="ChainFork1"&gt;{{cite web|title=11/12 March 2013 Chain Fork Information|url=http://bitcoin.org/chainfork.html|publisher=Bitcoin Project|accessdate=12 March 2013 | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20140214122619/https://bitcoin.org/chainfork.html | archivedate = 2014-02-14| deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt; The network reached consensus and continued to operate as normal a few hours after the split.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Bitcoin software bug has been rapidly resolved|url=http://ecurrency.ec/2013/03/bitcoin-bug-resolved/|publisher=ecurrency|date=12 March 2013 | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20140331083442/http://ecurrency.ec/2013/03/bitcoin-bug-resolved/ | archivedate = 2014-03-31| deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Regulatory issues==
On 18 March 2013, the [[Financial Crimes Enforcement Network]] (or FinCEN), a bureau of the [[United States Department of the Treasury]], issued a report regarding [[centralized]] and decentralized "virtual currencies" and their legal status within "[[money services business]]" (MSB) and [[Bank Secrecy Act]] regulations.&lt;ref name=FinCEN1 /&gt;&lt;ref name="ABA FINCEN" /&gt; It classified digital currencies and other digital payment systems such as bitcoin as "[[Virtual currency|virtual currencies]]" because they are not [[legal tender]] under any sovereign [[jurisdiction (area)|jurisdiction]]. FinCEN cleared American users of bitcoin of legal obligations&lt;ref name="ABA FINCEN" /&gt; by saying, "A user of virtual currency is not an MSB under FinCEN's regulations and therefore is not subject to MSB registration, reporting, and recordkeeping regulations." However, it held that American entities who generate "virtual currency" such as bitcoins are money transmitters or MSBs if they sell their generated currency for [[national currency]]: "...a person that creates units of convertible virtual currency and sells those units to another person for real currency or its equivalent is engaged in transmission to another location and is a money transmitter." This specifically extends to "miners" of the bitcoin currency who may have to register as MSBs and abide by the legal requirements of being a money transmitter if they sell their generated bitcoins for [[national currency]] and are within the United States.&lt;ref name="ArsFinCEN"&gt;{{cite web|last=Lee|first=Timothy|title=US regulator Bitcoin Exchanges Must Comply With Money Laundering Laws|url=https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2013/03/us-regulator-bitcoin-exchanges-must-comply-with-money-laundering-laws/|publisher=Ars Technica|date=20 March 2013|quote=Bitcoin miners must also register if they trade in their earnings for dollars. | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20131021203745/http://arstechnica.com:80/tech-policy/2013/03/us-regulator-bitcoin-exchanges-must-comply-with-money-laundering-laws/ | archivedate = 2013-10-21| deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since FinCEN issued this guidance, dozens of virtual currency exchangers and administrators have registered with FinCEN, and FinCEN is receiving an increasing number of [[suspicious activity report]]s (SARs) from these entities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Remarks From Under Secretary of Terrorism and Financial Intelligence David S. Cohen on 'Addressing the Illicit Finance Risks of Virtual Currency'|publisher=[[United States Department of the Treasury]]|date=March 18, 2014|url=http://www.treasury.gov/press-center/press-releases/Pages/jl236.aspx}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Additionally, FinCEN claimed regulation over American entities that manage bitcoins in a [[payment processor]] setting or as an exchanger: "In addition, a person is an exchanger and a money transmitter if the person accepts such de-centralized convertible virtual currency from one person and transmits it to another person as part of the acceptance and transfer of currency, funds, or other value that substitutes for currency."&lt;ref name="Finextra1"&gt;{{cite web|title=US govt clarifies virtual currency regulatory position|url=http://www.finextra.com/News/FullStory.aspx?newsitemid=24645|publisher=Finextra|date=19 March 2013 | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20140326183202/http://www.finextra.com/News/FullStory.aspx?newsitemid=24645 | archivedate = 2014-03-26| deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="FinCEN1"&gt;{{cite web|title=Application of FinCEN's Regulations to Persons Administering, Exchanging, or Using Virtual Currencies|url=http://www.fincen.gov/statutes_regs/guidance/pdf/FIN-2013-G001.pdf|publisher=Department of the Treasury Financial Crimes Enforcement Network|accessdate=19 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In summary, FinCEN's decision would require bitcoin exchanges where bitcoins are traded for traditional currencies to disclose large transactions and suspicious activity, comply with [[money laundering]] regulations, and collect information about their customers as traditional [[financial institutions]] are required to do.&lt;ref name="ABA FINCEN" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Forbes1"&gt;{{cite news|last=Lee|first=Timothy|title=New Money Laundering Guidelines Are A Positive Sign For Bitcoin|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/timothylee/2013/03/19/new-money-laundering-guidelines-are-a-positive-sign-for-bitcoin/|publisher=Forbes|date=19 March 2013 | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20131019052723/http://www.forbes.com:80/sites/timothylee/2013/03/19/new-money-laundering-guidelines-are-a-positive-sign-for-bitcoin/ | archivedate = 2013-10-19| deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="JapanTimes"&gt;{{cite news|title=The rise of the bitcoin: Virtual gold or cyber-bubble?|url=https://articles.washingtonpost.com/2013-04-04/world/38280106_1_bitcoin-satoshi-nakamoto-monetary-policy|publisher=Washington Post|date=4 April 2013 |first1=Anthony |last1=Faiola |first2=T.W. |last2=Farnam| archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20131029195258/http://articles.washingtonpost.com/2013-04-04/world/38280106_1_bitcoin-satoshi-nakamoto-monetary-policy | archivedate = 2013-10-29| deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Patrick Murck of the Bitcoin Foundation criticized FinCEN's report as an "overreach" and claimed that FinCEN "cannot rely on this guidance in any enforcement action".&lt;ref name="BTCFoundationFinCEN1"&gt;{{cite web|last=Murck|first=Patrick|title=Today, we are all money transmitters...

Jennifer Shasky Calvery, the director of FinCEN said, "Virtual currencies are subject to the same rules as other currencies. ... Basic money-services business rules apply here."&lt;ref name="ABA FINCEN" /&gt;

In its October 2012 study, ''Virtual currency schemes'', the [[European Central Bank]] concluded that the growth of virtual currencies will continue, and, given the currencies' inherent price instability, lack of close regulation, and risk of illegal uses by anonymous users, the Bank warned that periodic examination of developments would be necessary to reassess risks.&lt;ref name="ECBank201210"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ecb.int/pub/pdf/other/virtualcurrencyschemes201210en.pdf |title=Virtual Currency Schemes |date=October 2012 |publisher=European Central Bank |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6IQmm0QiP |archivedate=27 July 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In June 2013, Bitcoin Foundation board member Jon Matonis wrote in ''Forbes'' that he received a warning letter from the [[California Department of Financial Institutions]] accusing the foundation of unlicensed money transmission.  Matonis denied that the foundation is engaged in money transmission and said he viewed the case as "an opportunity to educate state regulators."&lt;ref name="NBCnews20130624"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nbcnews.com/technology/bitcoin-losing-shine-after-hitting-spotlight-6C10066339 |title=Bitcoin losing shine after hitting the spotlight |last=Coldewey |first=Devin |date=24 June 2013 |publisher=NBC News |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6IQjnlc52 |archivedate=27 July 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Theft and exchange shutdowns==
Bitcoins can be stored in a bitcoin [[cryptocurrency wallet]]. Theft of bitcoin has been documented on numerous occasions. At other times, bitcoin exchanges have shut down, taking their clients' bitcoins with them. A ''Wired'' study published April 2013 showed that 45 percent of bitcoin exchanges end up closing.&lt;ref name="Wired.co.UK"&gt;{{cite web|title=Study: 45 percent of Bitcoin exchanges end up closing

On 19 June 2011, a security breach of the [[Mt. Gox]] bitcoin exchange caused the nominal price of a bitcoin to fraudulently drop to one cent on the Mt. Gox exchange, after a hacker used credentials from a Mt. Gox auditor's compromised computer illegally to transfer a large number of bitcoins to himself.

On 5 December 2013, the [[People's Bank of China]] announced in a press release regarding bitcoin regulation that whilst individuals in China are permitted to freely trade and exchange bitcoins as a commodity, it is prohibited for Chinese financial banks to operate using bitcoins or for bitcoins to be used as legal tender currency, and that entities dealing with bitcoins must track and report suspicious activity to prevent money laundering.&lt;ref&gt;2013-12-05, [http://www.pbc.gov.cn/publish/goutongjiaoliu/524/2013/20131205153156832222251/20131205153156832222251_.html 中国人民银行等五部委发布《关于防范比特币风险的通知》], [[People's Bank of China]]  {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140122192430/http://www.pbc.gov.cn/publish/goutongjiaoliu/524/2013/20131205153156832222251/20131205153156832222251_.html |date=January 22, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The value of bitcoin dropped on various exchanges between 11 and 20 percent following the regulation announcement, before rebounding upward again.&lt;ref&gt;2013-12-06, [http://www.smh.com.au/business/markets/currencies/china-bans-banks-from-bitcoin-transactions-20131206-2yugy.html China bans banks from bitcoin transactions], [[The Sydney Morning Herald]] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140323102824/http://www.smh.com.au/business/markets/currencies/china-bans-banks-from-bitcoin-transactions-20131206-2yugy.html |date=March 23, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Arbitrary blockchain content==
Bitcoin's blockchain can be loaded with arbitrary data. In 2018 researchers from [[RWTH Aachen University|RWTH Aachen University and Goethe University]] identified 1,600 files added to the blockchain, 59 of which included links to unlawful images of child exploitation, politically sensitive content, or privacy violations. "Our analysis shows that certain content, eg, illegal pornography, can render the mere possession of a blockchain illegal."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author1=Roman Matzutt|author2=Jens Hiller|author3=Martin Henze|author4=Jan Henrik Ziegeldorf|author5=Dirk Mullmann|author6=Oliver Hohlfeld|author7=Klaus Wehrle|title=A Quantitative Analysis of the Impact of Arbitrary Blockchain Content on Bitcoin|url=https://fc18.ifca.ai/preproceedings/6.pdf|publisher=Financial Cryptography and Data Security 2018|pages=6–8|format=pdf|date=2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Interpol]] also sent out an alert in 2015 saying that "the design of the blockchain means there is the possibility of malware being injected and permanently hosted with no methods currently available to wipe this data".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.interpol.int/News-and-media/News/2015/N2015-033|publisher=Interpol|accessdate=20 March 2018|title=Interpol cyber research identifies malware threat to virtual currencies}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''InLiving'''''&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.inliving.co.uk Official InLiving Website]&lt;/ref&gt; is an [[educational game]] focusing on independent living. Aimed at young people aged 13–25, the game has been developed by [[Creative North Studios]] and [[Kirklees]] Neighbourhood Housing for use by housing organisations as a tool to deliver key information to prospective and current tenants. The game helps players understand the challenges they may face when moving into a property for the first time. The game was launched on 5 June 2008.

==Platform==
The game was originally developed for mobile phones and currently supports over 500 different devices. A web-based version of the game is currently in development due for release late 2009.

==Reception==
The game has had positive reception since its launch in June 2008 and was soon featured in ''Inside Housing'' in the 'What Works' section.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.insidehousing.co.uk/story.aspx?storycode=6500070 Inside Housing Article]&lt;/ref&gt; The InLiving project is also supported as part of the Innovation Exchange programme.&lt;ref&gt;[http://innovation-exchange.org/projects/12 Innovation Exchange Project Information]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Spin-offs==
Several other games have been developed based on the InLiving (Erudite) Platform. Two such games are HouseM8 and [[StreetM8]].

[[File:Eiserne Hand Glasnegativ 6 cropped.jpg|thumb|Second iron hand of Götz von Berlichingen, c. 1530]]
'''Iron hands''' are metal [[prosthesis|prostheses]] for hands and upper extremities from the [[middle ages]] and early modern period.  These designs combined cosmetic and functional properties. The most famous example of an iron hand was made around the year 1530, being the second prosthetic hand made for the German knight [[Götz von Berlichingen]].&lt;ref name="Quasi2"&gt;Quasigroch, Günter: ''Die Handprothesen des fränkischen Reichsritters Götz von Berlichingen. 2.&amp;nbsp;Fortsetzung: Die Zweithand.'' In: ''Waffen- und Kostümkunde.'' Vol.&amp;nbsp;25, 1983, pp.&amp;nbsp;103–120.&lt;/ref&gt;

Most iron hands are based on the same constructive principles, although there are considerable differences in complexity. [[Finger]]s can be [[Anatomical terms of motion#Flexion and extension|flexed]] passively (for example using the healthy hand) and are locked in place by a [[Ratchet (device)|ratchet]] mechanism, similar to those of contemporary [[Flintlock mechanism|flintlocks]]. [[Anatomical terms of motion#Flexion and extension|Extension]] of the fingers works by [[Leaf spring|spring]] pressure.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="812">'''Madia''' was a piece of [[furniture]] used during the High [[Renaissance]] period. It stored food and dishes. The madia was a service piece, meaning it was not made for looks, it was made to hold objects and used for a purpose. It would usually be found in the kitchen, not in an open area.

In Italy, the '''Madia''' was also a kitchen piece that was used to make bread.  The Madia had two parts, the first was a cupboard bottom that could be used to store items.  The top part could be lifted up.  The dough would be placed in the top portion where it could rise, and then would be baked.

The '''Magic Bullet''' is a compact [[blender]] sold by Homeland Housewares, a division of the American company Alchemy Worldwide, and sold in over 50 countries.&lt;ref name=FL&gt;[http://www.thefreelibrary.com/Alchemy+Worldwide+LLC+CEO+and+Direct+Response+TV+Veteran+Lenny+Sands...-a0159176558 "Alchemy Worldwide LLC CEO and Direct Response TV Veteran Lenny Sands Appointed by President George W. Bush to President's Export Council"], ''[[TheFreeLibrary.com]]'' (February 12, 2007)&lt;/ref&gt; It is widely [[Marketing|marketed]] through [[television advertisement]]s and [[infomercial]]s and sold in [[Retailing|retail stores]] under the "[[As seen on TV (marketing)|As seen on TV]]" banner. A [[Damaged good|feature-limited]] retail version not under this banner called the "Magic Bullet Single Shot+" is also available.

Since the introduction of the Magic Bullet, other incarnations include the '''Magic Bullet To Go''', the '''Magic Bullet Mini''',  the '''Bullet Express''', the '''Baby Bullet''', the '''NutriBullet''', the '''Party Bullet''' and the '''Dessert Bullet'''.

== Product ==
The Magic Bullet is a personal blender that is designed to be used as a space saving replacement for other appliances such as a blender, [[food processor]], and electric [[juicer]].{{cn|date=October 2016}} The name is derived from the [[ogive]]-shaped curve of the blending cups.{{cn|date=October 2016|reason=I dont see anything "ogive-shaped" in the picture}}  The entire Magic Bullet system consists of an electric blender base with a number of attachments. Some of the attachments are included with the product, and they are:
*one of two available screw-on blade attachments; the "cross blade" (used for chopping foods and crushing ice),
*two mixing cups, one short and one tall,
*two handled cups, called by the manufacturer "Party Mugs", which can be used to blend individual drinks (also with colored "Comfort Rings" that screw over the threads),
*lids for the cups, intended for storing foods, and
*an instruction manual which also contains a recipe book (''Magic Bullet 10 Second Recipes and Owner Manual''), featuring recipes prepared in the [[#Infomercial|infomercial]] and others.

Other add-ons can be purchased separately. These consist of:
*perforated lids for the cups that are used to ventilate items cooked in the cup when using a [[microwave oven]], and to dispense hard foods that have been ground using the appliance,
*the other of two available screw-on blade attachments: a "flat blade" (used for chopping harder foods, as well as for whipping),
*other attachments include a full size blender pitcher and a manual juice extractor attachment.

== Lawsuit and Explosion Allegations ==
In May 2018, Fox affiliate [[KTTV]] in Los Angeles obtained test videos from NutriBullet which appeared to show the machine exploding in different situations, and some consumers told FOX11 they were injured by using the blender. So far, 14 people have sued the company saying they were cut or burned when their NutriBullet exploded. The company has denied responsibility for the consumers’ injuries.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.foxnews.com/us/2018/05/04/nutribullet-sued-by-consumers-who-claim-product-blew-up-test-videos-show-machine-malfunctioning.html "Nutribullet sued by consumers who claim product blew up; test videos show machine malfunctioning"] by  Kathleen Joyce, ''Fox News'', 4 May 2018&lt;/ref&gt;

== Usage ==
The appliance is used by attaching a blade attachment to the desired cup and fitting the assembly upside down on top of the base. The base contains the motor that turns the blade, which is inside the cup. When one applies pressure to the top of the unit, the blade spins. If one turns the cup to lock into the base, it will continue to spin until it is disengaged.&lt;ref&gt;[https://designerjones.com/2005/10/28/the-magic-bullet-review/ "The Magic Bullet Review"] by Diane Vigil, ''Designer Jones'', 28 October 2005&lt;/ref&gt;

== Infomercial ==
The Magic Bullet is known for its 30-minute infomercial, broadcast mostly in the early hours of the morning.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wifeknows.com/best-blender-reviews/#NutriBullet "Juicer Review"], Juicer Reviews,  10 October 2016&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.slate.com/articles/life/food/2015/06/nutribullet_review_does_the_infomercial_star_deserve_its_breakout_blender.html "Everblasting Life"] by L. V. Anderson, ''[[Slate (magazine)|Slate]]'', 28 June 2015&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
The design for the Magic Bullet and its attachments is registered with the [[United States Patent and Trademark Office]] to Lenny Sands, CEO and founding partner of Alchemy Worldwide.&lt;ref name=FL /&gt;

Homeland Housewares has introduced add-ons and different versions of the Magic Bullet including the Bullet2Go (with various accessories), the Bullet Express, and a Fat Burning Boost [[Dietary supplement|supplement]] to be used in conjunction with the Magic Bullet.{{cn|date=January 2015}} In 2015, Magic Bullet introduced an app that offers breakfast, lunch and dinner recipes to Magic Bullet users. &lt;ref&gt;https://www.nutriliving.com/articles/introducing-the-magic-bullet-app&lt;/ref&gt;

In October 2017, the [[Bluetooth]]-enabled NutriBullet Balance was released.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.digitaltrends.com/home/nutribullet-balance/|title=See how food changes your smoothie’s nutrition with NutriBullet Balance|last=McGrath|first=Jenny|date=10 October 2017|work=[[Digital Trends]]|access-date=24 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The blender works with a companion app which allows users to track calories from ingredients processed using the machine.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.cnet.com/products/nutribullet-balance/preview/|title=NutriBullet Balance shows how many calories hide in your smoothies|last=Clark-Thompson|first=Ashlee|date=13 October 2017|work=[[CNET]]|access-date=24 January 2018|publisher=[[CBS Interactive]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Mini TSFO''' ([[TSFO|Training Set, Fire Observation]]) was the first [[artillery]] call-for-fire [[simulation]] designed for the [[personal computer]].  It was started in 1985 as an outgrowth of a [[Field Artillery]] [[Officer (armed forces)|Officer]] Advanced Course battlefield research project at the [[U.S. Army Field Artillery School]] (USAFAS) to develop a concept for incorporating PCs into artillery training, and was completed in 1986.  It replaced summer artillery live fire training for cadets at [[West Point]] in 1986 and 1987.

One of the USAFAS students involved in the battlefield research project, [[Captain (United States)|Captain]] (later [[Colonel]]) Bill Erwin, volunteered to continue to develop the concept into an actual application during his follow-on assignment to the USAFAS Directorate of Training and Doctrine.

Versions:

MINITSFO - Original version using a [[Digital Message Device|Digital Message Device (DMD)]], virtual map, and [[Color Graphics Adapter|CGA]] graphics.

VTSFO - Replaced the [[Digital Message Device|DMD]] with keyboard interface for use at West Point.

NGFTSFO - [[Naval Gunfire]] version using [[Enhanced Graphics Adapter|EGA]] graphics, actual scenes from San Clemente Island training area, and incorporating effects of dispersion between rounds.

==Evolution of a military video game==

As originally envisioned, the MiniTSFO would be a complete system that required only a computer to play.  This meant that there had to be some way to see targets on-screen, some way to locate the target coordinates such as a map, and some way to call for fire.  This resulted in a combination of three screens which the user could flip back-and-forth by using function keys.  The first screen showed a simutated view through an AN/GVS-5 [[laser rangefinder]].  The map screen was a depiction of the fictional German town of Nitzburg and surrounding area.  Lastly, the way to enter firing commands was a virtual AN/PSG-2 [[Digital Message Device|Digital Message Device (DMD)]].

The virtual DMD required extensive programming in order to simulate the actual operation of a real DMD and consumed most of the program code space.

The MiniTSFO was originally coded in [[BASICA]], an [[Interpreter (computing)|interpreted]] version of [[BASIC]] available on [[IBM]] [[Personal computer|PC]]s.  As the design of the program was pushing the limits of BASICA, [[Microsoft]] introduced the [[QuickBASIC]] [[compiler]].  This allowed the MiniTSFO to grow beyond the memory limits of BASICA and structured programming allowed additional complexity.

In its initial design, the MiniTSFO drew all screens from program code.  It wasn't long before the limitations of this approach became obvious and so the screens completed to date were captured and imported into [[PC Paintbrush]] to be edited.  This allowed the additional of details that would have been too tedious to incorporate through code and also allowed the target screens to be easily edited to add additional types of targets.

To allow the target screens to be easily changed to provide additional challenges, the target locations and descriptions were read in from an initialization file when the MiniTSFO was started.

==MiniTSFO (classic edition)==

[[Image:tsfomap.gif|thumb|200px|MiniTSFO Classic map screen|right]]

[[Image:tsfodmd.gif|thumb|200px|MiniTSFO Classic DMD screen|right]]

The MiniTSFO used a virtual [[Digital Message Device|DMD]] to control fire missions.  The user was presented with one of five random target screens.  The user would then determine how to engage the target by either grid location, polar coordinates, or shifting from a known point by flipping back and forth between the target screen and the map.  Once the target was located, the user would go to the virtual DMD and enter a fire mission just as a real FO would do with a real DMD.  Messages back and forth between the user and the fire direction center (shot and splash) would precede the depiction of an artillery round bursting where the user had described the target location.  The user would then use the virtual DMD to adjust the fire onto the target, fire for effect, and then give end-of-mission details.  After the end of the fire mission, the user would be critiqued on several factors such as initial target location, description, how many rounds were needed to fire-for-effect, and overall mission completion.

The best available graphic card for a PC at that time was the [[Color Graphics Adapter|CGA]] which allowed for 320x200 resolution in only four colors.  This meant that the graphics for the MiniTSFO, while state-of-the-art for the time, would be considered very crude by today's standards.

==Trainer edition==

This was the classic edition with the DMD removed and a keyboard interface used instead.  [[Non-commissioned officer|NCOs]] training cadets at West Point decided that teaching them to use a DMD was too time-consuming, and wanted them to just call the fire mission information to the NCO in charge, who would then enter it into the MiniTSFO.  This was the only difference from the classic edition.

==Naval gunfire edition==

In 1987, the Joint Munitions Effectiveness Group became concerned that existing simulations such as the TSFO gave an unrealistic picture of effects on a target because the effect of dispersion between rounds was not taken into account.  In other words, if you fired 10 rounds at a target, not all the rounds would hit in the same spot.  Most would hit close to the target and a couple might be quite a distance away in a pattern along the gun-to-target line.  This can be computed using a Gaussian distribution function.

Efforts to include this effect in the TSFO were deemed too expensive and lengthy.  One of the members of the group was familiar with the MiniTSFO and suggested that it be modified.  Additionally, since the original MiniTSFO supported the Army call for fire process, it was deemed appropriate to have the new version support the Naval Gunfire (NGF) process.

Work began immediately.  By this time, the [[Enhanced Graphics Adapter|Extended Graphics Adapter (EGA)]] was commonly available for the PC offering 640/350 resolution and a palette of 16 colors.  Photographs of the San Clemente Island impact area were scanned in, incorporated into PC Paintbrush for cleanup, and realistic targets added.  An actual map of the area was also scanned in, providing additional realism.

The virtual DMD was replaced by a fire mission workup board, as was used by Naval Gunfire Liaison Officers.  Once the target was located, the user would flip to the workup board, enter the mission information, and submit to the ship.

Communications back and forth were through a scrolling strip of text at the bottom of the screen.  The actual transmissions that would be used in a real naval gunfire mission kept the user informed on the progress of the mission.

Besides the enhanced graphics and dispersion, several additional enhancements were made.  The ship's location would move during the conduct of the fire mission and the user would see the pattern of rounds on the ground move along with the ship as its direction to the target shifted.  The initialization file listed the direction, speed, and weapon type for each available firing platform.  Also, the effects on the target would be judged on how close the rounds actually came to the target based on the caliber of the weapon.

==Unfinished work==

Development of expansion cards for PCs which allowed communication with the [[TACFIRE]] system raised the possibility of using an actual DMD to replace the virtual DMD in the MiniTSFO and also of using the MiniTSFO's virtual DMD to communicate with a real TACFIRE system.

[[Image:vertdmd.gif|thumb|200px|MiniTSFO for Windows virtual DMD|left]]
[[Image:dmdconnections.gif|thumb|200px|Virtual DMD connection options|right]]

==The MiniTSFO's legacy==

For several years, the Field Artillery School used the MiniTSFO as an example of the school's leadership in adopting computer technology.  An overview of the MiniTSFO was briefed to all pre-command classes for Field Artillery [[battalion]] and [[brigade]] commanders as well as visiting dignitaries.  It also provided some inspiration for the developers of the Guardfist II, a much more capable system.  Some artillerymen used it to keep their skills up (the director of the USAFAS Gunnery Department used it before meeting with lieutenants in basic artillery training so that he could impress them with his skills with a DMD).  In retrospect, it was a good introduction to what was to come later.

The '''Mrkšina crkva printing house''' ({{lang-sr|Штампарија Манастира Мркшина Црквa; Мркшиначка штампарија}})&lt;ref name="Plavšić1959"&gt;{{cite book|author=Lazar Plavšić|title=Srpske štamparije: od kraja XV do sredine XIX veka|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=f3QLAAAAMAAJ|year=1959|publisher=Udruženje grafičkih preduzeća Jugoslavije|page=126|quote=ШТАМПАРИЈА МАНАСТИРА МРКШИНА ЦРКВА}}&lt;/ref&gt; was a printing house established in 1562 in the Monastery of Mrkšina Crkva in village [[Kosjerić]] in [[Ottoman Serbia]] (today a town in [[Serbia]]). This printing house was operational until 1566 and printed two [[srbulje]] books, [[Gospel#Canonical gospels|The Four Gospels]] (Четворојеванђеље) in 1562 and ''The Flower Triod'' (Триод Цветни) in 1566.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Proceedings in history|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ehcWAQAAMAAJ|year=1979|publisher=Odeljenje za društvene nauke, Matica srpska|page=221|quote= Мркшина Црква 1562–1566}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1567 the Ottomans destroyed the church and its printing house.

== Location ==
Today the exact location of this printing house is unknown. There are different theories about exact location of the monastery and its printing house, but all of them agree that it was somewhere near [[Kosjerić]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Uzicki zbornik|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=bSGFAAAAIAAJ|year=1989|page=114|quote=Сви који су до сада о томе писали слажу се само у једном, да је Мркшина црква била негде око Косјерића. }}&lt;/ref&gt; One of the most possible locations is above the county house and  mouth of the river Kladoroba and [[Skrapež]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Zbornik Matice srpske za književnost i jezik|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=xqdiAAAAMAAJ|year=1991|publisher=Матица српска|page=513}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Printing ==
The books created in the printing house were edited and printed by [[Hieromonk Mardarije]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Uzicki zbornik|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=bSGFAAAAIAAJ|year=1989|page=114}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to some sources, it was Mardarije who inspired first Dmitrović and then Gundulić to invest in a printing business and organized all activities during the set up of the printing house in Belgrade.&lt;ref name="društvo1922"&gt;{{cite book|author=Srpsko geografsko društvo|title=Glasnik Srpskog geografskog društva: Bulletin de la Société serbe de geographie|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=-Tv5fVh-s74C|year=1922|publisher=Srpsko geografsko društvo|page=189|quote=Сва три, пак, записа утврђују : да је јеромонах Мардарије, оснивач штампарије, био један од калуђера велике главе и истрајне ... }}&lt;/ref&gt; Some sources explain that Mardarije moved a printing press from Belgrade to Mrkšina crkva monastery.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Annuaire du musee de la ville de Beograd|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=hYcSAAAAIAAJ|year=1955|publisher=Beogradske novine|page=91|quote= Неки наши научници сматрају да је ту штампарију понео собом у Мркшину Цркву јеромонах Мардарије. }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Vojska|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=CoIpAQAAIAAJ|year=2004|publisher=Vojnoizdavački i novinski centar|page=167|quote=Штампарија из Београда пренета је у Мркшину цркву код ...}}&lt;/ref&gt; Two books were printed in the Mrkšina crkva printing house:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Историски записи|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=GkRpAAAAMAAJ|year=1994|publisher=с.н.|page=198}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Flower Triod is recognizable because in this book Mardarije preferred to use figural motifs instead of the [[Ornament (art)|ornaments]].&lt;ref name="Medaković"&gt;{{cite book|last=Medaković|first=Dejan|authorlink=Dejan Medaković|title=Izabrane srpske teme: studije i prilozi|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=f3UvAQAAIAAJ|publisher=Beogradski izdavačko-grafički zavod|page=119|quote=Нешто доцније, 1562-65, срећемо још једном његово име у штампарији Мркшине цркве.

== Aftermath ==
In 1567 the Ottomans burned the church and its printing house,&lt;ref name="kosjeric.rs"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.kosjeric.rs/dokumenta/opstina/skupstina/2012/resenje_ulice.pdf |title=Decision of the Assembly of Kosjerić municipality, 9 February 2012 |publisher=kosjeric.rs|accessdate=2015-02-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; while the monks fled to [[Rača monastery]], similar to monks from [[Rujno Monastery printing house]] who fled there after 1537.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Brastvo|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=j2gaAQAAIAAJ|year=1930|publisher=Društvo sv.

A '''noseclip''' or '''nose clip''' is a device made of wire covered in rubber or of plastic, and is worn by people during a wide range of aquatic activities such as [[kayaking]], [[Free-diving|freediving]],&lt;ref&gt;[[Umberto Pelizzari|Pelizzari, Umberto]] &amp; Tovaglieri, Stefano (2001) ''‘Manual of Freediving: Underwater on a single breath’'', English translation 2004 by Idelson-Gnocchi Ltd., Reddick, FL; {{ISBN|1928649270}}&lt;/ref&gt; recreational [[Human swimming|swimming]], [[synchronized swimming]] and [[waterdance]]. It is designed to hold the nostrils closed to prevent water from entering, or air from escaping. Some types of nose clips also feature a long band to keep the clip around the neck while it is not being used.

Established in 1987, the '''Ohio Supercomputer Center''' ('''OSC''') is a partner of Ohio universities and industries, providing researchers with [[high performance computing]], advanced cyberinfrastructure, research and computational science education services.

OSC is an organizational member of the [[Ohio Board of Regents]]’ Ohio Technology Consortium&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Petro|first=Jim|title=Chancellor Petro Announces Creation of Ohio Technology Consortium (OH-TECH) Share|url=https://www.ohiohighered.org/press/chancellor-petro-announces-creation-ohio-technology-consortium-oh-tech|accessdate=13 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;  and works with an array of statewide/regional/national communities, including education, academic research, industry, and state government. The Center's research programs are primarily aligned with three of several key areas of [https://www.osc.edu/research/research_reports research] identified by the state to be well positioned for growth and success: biosciences, advanced materials and energy/environment.

'''Prominent program areas at OSC currently include:'''
* [https://awesim.org/ AweSim] industrial engagement program
* [http://rrscs.org/home Ralph Regula School of Computational Science]
* [https://www.osc.edu/research/Biomed Virtual Environments and Simulation] program

OSC is funded through the [[Ohio Board of Regents]] by the state operating and capital budgets of the [[Ohio General Assembly]]. OSC offices are located on the West Campus of [[The Ohio State University]] in [[Columbus, Ohio]], [[United States]].

== History ==
OSC was established by the Ohio Board of Regents in 1987 as a statewide resource designated to place Ohio's research universities and private industry in the forefront of computational research. Also in 1987, the OSC networking initiative — known today as [[OARnet]] — provided the first network access to the Center’s first Cray supercomputer.

In 1988, OSC launched the Center’s Industrial Interface Program to serve businesses interested in accessing the supercomputer. [[Battelle Memorial Institute]], located just south of Ohio State, became OSC’s first industrial user. Today, the Center continues to offer HPC services to researcher in industry, primarily through its AweSim industrial engagement program.

In the summer of 1989, 20 talented high school students attended the first Governor’s Summer Institute. Today, OSC offers summer STEM education programs through [https://www.osc.edu/education/si Summer Institute] and [https://www.osc.edu/education/ywsi Young Women's summer Institute], which began in 2000.

Later in the fall of 1989, OSC engineers installed a $22 million Cray Y-MP8/864 system, which was deemed the largest and fastest supercomputer in the world for a short time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Hunt|first=Spencer|title=Ohio Supercomputer Center still evolving|url=http://www.dispatch.com/content/stories/science/2013/04/07/2-ohio-supercomputer-center-still-evolving.html|publisher=Columbus Dispatch|accessdate=13 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The seven-ton system was able to calculate 200 times faster than many mainframes at that time.

'''''Pacific Rim: Uprising''''' is a 2018 American [[science fiction film]] directed by [[Steven S. DeKnight]] (in his [[List of directorial debuts|feature-film directorial debut]]), and written by DeKnight, [[Emily Carmichael (filmmaker)|Emily Carmichael]], Kira Snyder, and [[T.S. Nowlin]]. It is the sequel to the 2013 film ''[[Pacific Rim (film)|Pacific Rim]]'', with [[Guillermo del Toro]], the director of the original, serving as a producer. The sequel stars [[John Boyega]] (also making his producer debut), as well as [[Scott Eastwood]], [[Cailee Spaeny]], [[Jing Tian]], [[Adria Arjona]], and [[Zhang Jin]], with [[Rinko Kikuchi]], [[Charlie Day]], and [[Burn Gorman]] returning from the original film. Set in the year 2035&lt;!-- DO NOT CHANGE --&gt;, the plot follows humanity again fighting [[Kaiju]], the giant monsters set on destroying the world.

[[Principal photography]] began in November 2016 in [[Australia]]. The film was released in the United States on March 23, 2018, by [[Universal Pictures]], in 2D, [[Real D 3D]], [[IMAX 3D]], and [[IMAX]], and grossed $290 million worldwide. It received mixed reviews from critics; with some calling the film inferior to del Toro's and criticizing the scope, pacing, story, as well as the absent characters from the previous film and the underdeveloped new characters, while others praised the visual effects and performances of Boyega and Spaeny.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/films/news/pacific-rim-uprising-film-review-john-boyega-sequel-a8266091.html|title=Pacific Rim Uprising review round up: Here's what the critics are saying|first=Jacob |last=Stolworthy|work=[[The Independent]]|date=March 21, 2018|accessdate=March 21, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://variety.com/2018/film/news/pacific-rim-uprising-box-office-beating-black-panther-1202734775/|title=Box Office: ‘Pacific Rim Uprising’ to Unseat ‘Black Panther’ With Modest $23 Million|last=McNary|first=Dave|work=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]|publisher=[[Penske Business Media]]|date=March 23, 2018|accessdate=March 23, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Plot==
&lt;!-- Per WP:FILMPLOT, plot summaries for feature films should be between 400 to 700 words only. --&gt;
It is 2035, ten years [[Pacific Rim (film)|after the Battle of the Breach]], in which the interdimensional portal created by the Precursors (through which they sent marauding Kaiju) was closed.  Former Jaeger pilot Jake Pentecost &amp;ndash; son of Battle of the Breach hero Stacker Pentecost &amp;ndash; makes a living by stealing and selling Jaeger parts on the [[black market]] in the [[Los Angeles]] area. After he tracks part of a disabled Jaeger's power core to the secret workshop of fifteen year-old Jaeger enthusiast Amara Namani, both are arrested by the Pan-Pacific Defense Corps (PPDC) after an altercation between Amara's small, single-pilot Jaeger ''Scrapper'' and the Police Jaeger ''November Ajax''. Jake's adoptive sister and PPDC Secretary General Mako Mori gives Jake a choice between prison or returning to PPDC as an instructor, with Amara as his recruit.

Arriving at the China Shatterdome, Jake starts training Jaeger program cadets with his estranged former co-pilot Nate Lambert. Nate and Mako reveal to him that the Jaeger program is threatened by Shao Corporation's new drone program, which offers to mass-produce Jaeger drones developed by Shao Liwen and Dr. Newton Geiszler. Mako is due to deliver a final assessment to determine the approval of the drones at a PPDC council meeting in [[Sydney]], but is killed by rogue Jaeger ''Obsidian Fury'' before she can report. Her death prompts the PPDC council to immediately authorize and deploy the drones. 

Moments before her death, Mako had transmitted the location of a defunct Jaeger production facility in [[Siberia]]. Jake and Nate travel there in ''Gipsy Avenger'', but ''Obsidian Fury'' destroys the complex and engages them in battle. Upon destroying its reactor, they find that ''Obsidian Fury'' was piloted by a Kaiju's secondary brain, which testing shows was grown on Earth.

When the drones reach their respective locations, their piloting operations are taken over by cloned Kaiju brains secretly mounted onboard. The Kaiju-Jaeger hybrids simultaneously attack all Pacific Rim Shatterdomes, inflicting heavy casualties on PPDC forces and incapacitating almost all Jaegers. Hermann Gottlieb and Geiszler try to disable the drones, but Hermann discovers that Geiszler is behind the attack when he commands the Kaiju-Jaeger hybrids to open multiple breaches across the Pacific Rim. Geiszler‘s mind has been taken over by the Precursors, who forged a link when he originally drifted with a Kaiju brain (first film). Although Shao is able to destroy the drones, closing the breaches, three Kaijus had already emerged and reached [[Tokyo]]. The team realizes that the Precursors' true goal is to activate the [[Ring of Fire]] by detonating [[Mount Fuji]] with the Kaijus' blood, spreading toxic gas into the atmosphere and wiping out all life on Earth while terraforming the planet for Precursor colonization.

The cadets are mobilized while Gottlieb and Shao repair the PPDC's four salvageable Jaegers; Jake and Nate’s ''Gipsy Avenger'' is joined by ''Guardian Bravo'' (piloted by cadets Suresh and Ilya),  ''Saber Athena'' (cadets Renata and Ryoichi) and the three-pilot ''Bracer Phoenix'' (cadets Amara, Viktoria and Jinhai). Gottlieb develops Kaiju-blood-powered rockets, which launch the team to Tokyo. Although the Jaegers initially repel the three Kaiju, Geiszler merges them into a Mega-Kaiju using robotic parasites from one of Shao's factories. The Mega-Kaiju quickly overpowers the Jaegers, injures Nate, kills Suresh, and destroys three of the four Jaegers, leaving ''Gipsy Avenger'' as the only operational Jaeger. Jake and Amara pilot it against the Mega-Kaiju, with Shao remote piloting ''Scrapper'' and aiding them by locating a rocket and welding it to ''Gipsy'', which sends the Jaeger (with ''Scrapper'' holding on) into the atmosphere and free-falling back to Earth, colliding into the Mega-Kaiju and killing it, while Jake and Amara survive by transferring to ''Scrapper''. Geiszler, angered by the Mega-Kaiju's failure, tries to flee, but is subdued by Nate.

In custody of the PPDC, Geiszler threatens that Precursors will keep sending attacks, but Jake replies that humanity will soon be the ones attacking the Precursors.

=== Music ===
{{Main article|Pacific Rim Uprising (soundtrack)}}
Composer [[John Paesano]] was originally slated to be writing the score for the film, replacing the first film's composer [[Ramin Djawadi]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pacificrim2-movie.com/news/john-pesano-score-pacific-rim-uprising|title=John Paesano to Score Pacific Rim: Uprising |work=Pacific Rim 2 Movie News |author=Danzilla93 |accessdate=April 20, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, in January 2018, it was announced that Paesano had been replaced by [[Lorne Balfe]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://filmmusicreporter.com/2018/01/24/lorne-balfe-scoring-pacific-rim-uprising/ |title=Lorne Balfe Scoring ‘Pacific Rim Uprising’ |work=Film Music Reporter |author=filmmusicreporter |date=January 24, 2018 |accessdate=March 14, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The soundtrack was digitally released on March 23, 2018 by [[Milan Records]] with the physical format being released later on April 6, 2018.

===Visual Effects===
The visual effects are done by [[DNEG]] (Double Negative), Atomic Fiction, Blind LTD and [[Territory Studio]], with Peter Chiang and Jim Berney serving as visual effects supervisors.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.cinefex.com/upcomingfilms/upcoming.php?id=531&lt;/ref&gt; Production designer Stefan Dechant tried to push "the look and the feel" of the Jaegers, stating that while in the original film they resembled tanks, the new generation of robots tried to be more like a fighter jet. The robots became more acrobatic and had silhouettes and color schemes that allowed them to become distinct and recognizable. Artists from [[Industrial Light &amp; Magic]], who made the effects in the first film, helped develop Gipsy Avenger, a "sleek and advanced" upgraded version of Gipsy Danger which DeKnight often compared to the ''[[Starship Enterprise|USS Enterprise]]'' in being "awe-inspiring" given its status as the Jaeger flagship.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite av media|title=Next Level Jaegers|type=Featurette|location=Pacific Rim Uprising Blu-Ray}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Critical response ===
On [[review aggregator]] website [[Rotten Tomatoes]], the film holds an approval rating of 43% based on 211 reviews, and an [[average rating]] of 5/10. The website's critical consensus reads, "''Pacific Rim Uprising'' won't win any points for subtlety or originality, but it delivers enough of the rock 'em-sock 'em robots-vs.-kaiju thrills that fans of the original will be looking for."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/pacific_rim_uprising |title=Pacific Rim Uprising (2018) |work=[[Rotten Tomatoes]] |publisher=[[Fandango (company)|Fandango Media]] |accessdate=August 27, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; On [[Metacritic]], the film has a weighted average score of 44 out of 100, based on 44 critics, indicating "mixed or average reviews".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.metacritic.com/movie/pacific-rim-uprising |title=Pacific Rim: Uprising Reviews |work=[[Metacritic]] |publisher=[[CBS Interactive]] |accessdate=March 28, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Audiences polled by [[CinemaScore]] gave the film an average grade of "B" on an A+ to F scale, down from the first film's "A–", while [[PostTrak]] reported filmgoers gave it an overall positive score of 78%.&lt;ref name=opening/&gt;

Mark Kennedy of ''[[Associated Press]]'' called the film "cheer-at-the-screen fun" and awarded it 3.5 out of 4 stars, lauding Boyega's performance and his chemistry with Spaeny, while also commending DeKnight for using daylight instead of the rainy night settings of del Toro.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Kennedy |first=Mark |date=March 21, 2018 |title=Review: ‘Pacific Rim Uprising’ is cheer-at-the-screen fun |url=https://apnews.com/3d8cdc275a3340598ceee8a6bba0a9f1/Review:-'Pacific-Rim-Uprising'-is-cheer-at-the-screen-fun|agency=[[Associated Press]] |accessdate=March 22, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mel Evans of ''[[Metro (British newspaper)|Metro]]'' gave the film 4 out of 5 stars, calling it "very loud, mighty fun, but not much more," while also applauding Boyega for his performance and noting his chemistry with Eastwood.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Evans |first=Mel |date=March 20, 2018 |title=Pacific Rim Uprising review: Very loud, mighty fun, but not much more |url=http://metro.co.uk/2018/03/20/pacific-rim-uprising-review-loud-mighty-fun-not-much-7402391/|work=[[Metro (British newspaper)|Metro]] |accessdate=March 22, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ethan Sacks of ''[[New York Daily News]]'' gave the film 3 out of 5 stars, and was also positive of Boyega's and Spaeny's performances, comparing Boyega's character to [[Han Solo]]. However, he criticized the dense backstories of the characters, noting that, "a movie about massive monster-fighting robots doesn't need so much engineering."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Sacks |first=Ethan |date=March 20, 2018 |title=‘Pacific Rim Uprising’ review: not the giant action romp it should be |url=http://www.nydailynews.com/entertainment/movies/pacific-rim-uprising-review-not-giant-action-romp-article-1.3885987|work=[[New York Daily News]] |accessdate=March 22, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Richard Roeper]] of the ''[[Chicago Sun-Times]]'' gave the film 2 out of 4 stars, saying: "The climactic battle drags on forever and looks like a high-tech update of a monster movie clash of the titans from a half-century ago. Even the sight of the residents of Tokyo scrambling for their lives as a giant lizard monster stomps through the city serves only as a reminder we're sitting through a glorified B-movie with nothing new to say."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Roeper |first=Richard |authorlink=Richard Roeper |date=March 21, 2018 |title=‘Pacific Rim Uprising’: Tedious sequel a sea change from original monster movie|url=https://chicago.suntimes.com/entertainment/pacific-rim-uprising-tedious-sequel-a-sea-change-from-original-monster-movie/|work=[[Chicago Sun-Times]] |accessdate=March 21, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; David Ehrlich of [[IndieWire]] gave the film a "C–", calling it a "generic and diverting sequel that corrects some of the original's biggest mistakes while also highlighting some of its more eccentric charms."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Ehrlich |first=David |date=March 20, 2018|title=‘Pacific Rim Uprising’ Review: This Bland Sequel Is Only a Minor Improvement on Guillermo del Toro’s Original|url=http://www.indiewire.com/2018/03/pacific-rim-uprising-review-john-boyega-1201940986/|work=[[IndieWire]] |publisher=[[Penske Business Media]] |accessdate=March 21, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Cary Darling of the ''[[Houston Chronicle]]'' gave it 1.5 out of 5 stars and called it the worst film of 2018 so far, being especially critical of its bland premise and pandering attempt at international marketability. Darling concluded, "''Pacific Rim Uprising'' is a lot like the city-crunching monsters it stars: big, loud and as dull-witted as [[Homer Simpson]] roused from a medically induced coma. It's a rote, paint-by-numbers blockbuster that would be offensive in its mediocrity if it also weren't so relentlessly uninspired," and "all that's left is the robot brawling and the marketing."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Darling |first=Cary |date=March 21, 2018 |title=Is 'Pacific Rim Uprising' the worst movie of 2018 so far?|url=https://www.houstonchronicle.com/entertainment/movies/article/Is-Pacific-Rim-Uprising-the-worst-movie-of-2018-12771765.php|work=[[Chicago Sun-Times]] |accessdate=March 22, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ignatiy Vishnevetsky of ''[[The A.V. Club]]'' called the film an "impersonal sequel," stating "simply put, it lacks its predecessor's curiosity about its world—its fascination with colorful backdrops and machines. Del Toro's movie [...] had an idealistic vision for its anime-influenced hobby-store pursuits [...] ''Pacific Rim: Uprising'' offers only its spare parts."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Vishnevetsky |first=Ignatiy |authorlink=Ignatiy Vishnevetsky |date=March 21, 2018 |title=Guillermo Del Toro’s geeky Pacific Rim gets an impersonal sequel in Uprising|url=https://www.avclub.com/guillermo-del-toro-s-geeky-pacific-rim-gets-an-imperson-1823955570|work=[[The A.V. Club]] |publisher=[[The Onion]] |accessdate=March 22, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, Mick LaSalle of the ''[[San Francisco Chronicle]]'' noted that "DeKnight doesn't attempt to invest his monsters with majesty, the way Guillermo del Toro did in the previous film. With DeKnight it's just a lot of pounding, smashing and driving, purely functional."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=LaSalle |first=Mick |authorlink=Mick LaSalle |date=March 21, 2018 |title=Angry monsters are back, but Guillermo del Toro isn’t, in ‘Pacific Rim’ sequel |url=https://www.sfchronicle.com/movies/article/Angry-monsters-are-back-but-Guillermo-del-Toro-12770878.php|work=[[San Francisco Chronicle]] |publisher=[[Hearst Communications]] |accessdate=March 22, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Future ==
In October 2017, five months before the film’s release, DeKnight stated "If enough people show up to this, we've already talked about the plot of the third movie, and how the end of the third movie would expand the universe to a ''Star Wars''/''Star Trek''-style [franchise or series] where you can go in many, many different directions... You can go main canon, you can go spin-offs, you can go one-offs. Yeah, that's the plan."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.slashfilm.com/pacific-rim-universe/|title=Expanded ‘Pacific Rim’ Universe May Be Coming Soon, Says ‘Uprising’ Director|last=Pearson|first=Ben|work=[[/Film]]|date=October 9, 2017|accessdate=October 22, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; DeKnight also talked about the possibility of a crossover with the [[MonsterVerse]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://collider.com/pacific-rim-godzilla-king-kong-crossover-monsters-universe/#steven-s-deknight|title=Exclusive: ‘Pacific Rim Uprising’ Director Says Crossover with ‘Godzilla’ and ‘King Kong’ Is Possible|last=Chitwood|first=Adam|publisher=[[Complex (magazine)|Complex Media]]|work=[[Collider (website)|Collider]]|date=October 20, 2017|accessdate=October 22, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; as co-writer T.S.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3079">A '''papyrus sanitary pad''', or '''Makapad''', is a [[sanitary napkin]] made from [[papyrus]], a natural material. It is reported to be 75 percent cheaper than a conventional pad and thus an advantage to the poor, as well as being highly absorbent.

== Production ==
The pads, developed by Dr. Moses Kizza Musaazi at [[Uganda]]'s [[Makerere University]] Department of Technology, are targeted especially at rural primary school girls who have started [[Menstrual cycle|menstruating]]. These girls would normally find it difficult to attend school if they had no pads, and often cannot afford conventional pads. These sanitary pads also provide employment opportunities for the women of the rural communities in Uganda. They are made entirely by hand, and using local materials.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.unhcr.org/en-us/news/latest/2013/3/5141cc7a6/papyrus-scrap-paper-monthly-blessing-refugee-women-uganda.html|title=UN High Commission for Refugees|last=Mahoney|first=Kathryn|date=14 March 2013|website=UNHCR|publisher=UN|access-date=25 Sep 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.capitalfm.co.ke/lifestyle/2013/09/03/makapads-local-technology-makes-papyrus-sanitary-pads-affordable/|title=MakaPads: Local technology makes papyrus sanitary pads affordable - Capital Lifestyle|date=2013-09-03|work=Capital Lifestyle|access-date=2018-10-30|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This was part of the UN Refugee Agency (UNHCR) program to provide locally made Makapads to women and girls throughout refugee camps in Uganda.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; 

The pads are made out of dry papyrus and mixed with waste paper and then stitched with non-woven absorbent piece of cloth.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://ugandaradionetwork.com/story/papyrus-waste-paper-reinvented-into-sanitary-pads|title=Papyrus, Waste Paper Reinvented Into Sanitary Pads|last=angiji|first=Evelyn|work=Uganda Radio Network|access-date=2018-10-30|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; They are made almost entirely from natural materials, with a few percent of non-woven material and polythene paper. These pads are biodegradable and environment-friendly.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.onegirl.org.au/blog/papyrus-lead-sanitary-pad-journey|title=From papyrus leaf to pad.

'''Plascore Incorporated''' manufactures honeycomb core, cleanrooms, and composite panels marketed under the brand Plascore. Honeycomb is used in aerospace, marine, military, safety, transportation, and other applications.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.macraesbluebook.com/search/company.cfm?company=326035  Plascore, Inc.'' MacRae's Blue Book Website.'']&lt;/ref&gt; When honeycomb is sandwiched between two surfaces, it effectively creates a distance between the two surfaces more or less like an I-beam. The resulting composite structure exhibits a high strength-to-weight ratio and shear strength. Shear strength is the measured ability of a material to resist structural failure. Plascore honeycomb is designed to increase shear strength while adding minimal additional weight.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.toolingu.com/definition-670130-41278-shear-strength.html (2009). ''What is the definition of "shear strength"?'']&lt;/ref&gt; Plascore is a global organization, with a 185,000 sq. ft. headquarters and three additional manufacturing facilities in [[Zeeland, Michigan]]. Those three facilities are 50,000, 40,000 and 80,000 sq. ft. in size. The company also has an 85,000 sq. ft. manufacturing plant in [[Waldlaubersheim]], Germany; and sales offices throughout the world. Plascore is AS/EN/JISQ9100,  ISO 14001:2004, and [[ISO 9001|ISO 9001:2008]] Certified, and the company's PP Honeycomb has received a Lloyds Register Certificate of Approval of a Core Material. Plascore is also [[AS9100]] certified,&lt;ref&gt;''Plascore AS9100 and ISO-9001 Certificate''&lt;/ref&gt; an industry standard required by the majority of major aircraft manufacturers that provides verification of consistent aerospace product quality.&lt;!-- Deleted image removed:  [[Image:Shear Strength Graphic.jpg|thumb|right|400px|alt=A graphic demonstrating how honeycomb core increases shear strength and flexural stiffness|Honeycomb core increases flexural stiffness used in by increasing the distance between two stress skins.

==History==
Plascore was founded in 1977 as a manufacturer of honeycomb core sold to various value added manufacturers. By the 1980s, Plascore’s product development and manufacturing capabilities led the company into value-added markets, including cleanroom walls, ceiling and door systems for semi-conductor and pharmaceutical sectors; panels for transportation products and building materials and energy absorbers for various markets.

In 2002, Plascore received an award  from [[CERN]] for its role in the design and manufacture of large honeycomb panels used in detection chambers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.accessmylibrary.com/coms2/summary_0286-25271252_ITM|title=Plascore receives awards from CERN|date=April 15, 2002|work=Advanced Materials &amp; Composites News  |accessdate=18 December 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In August 2009, Plascore received tax abatements from the city of Zeeland for new equipment and machinery installed at its facilities in Zeeland.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.mlive.com/news/grand-rapids/index.ssf/2009/08/zeeland_city_council_oks_plasc.html|title=Zeeland City Council OKs Plascore tax breaks|date=August 13, 2009 |work=The Grand Rapids Press|accessdate=18 December 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

With the increase in fuel and the growing need for lighter structure products, honeycomb gained increasing popularity in the marine industry, where it allows boat designers to add strength to hull manufacturing and also save weight, for example by using thin layers of stone laminated to honeycomb for luxury yacht countertops rather than solid stone.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.compositesworld.com/articles/composites-in-boat-accessories-and-hardware.aspx|title= Composites in Boat Accessories and Hardware|last=Dawson |first=Donna |date=October 1, 2006 |work=Composites Technology |accessdate=18 December 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2012, Plascore constructed a new facility for increased [[Nomex]] manufacturing capabilities.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="28597">'''Psychological manipulation''' is a type of [[social influence]] that aims to change the behavior or [[perception]] of others through [[abuse|abusive]], [[deceptive]], or underhanded tactics.&lt;ref name=braiker/&gt; By advancing the interests of the manipulator, often at another's expense, such methods could be considered exploitative, abusive, devious, and deceptive. 

[[Social influence]] is not necessarily negative. For example, people such as friends, family and doctors, can try to [[persuade]] to change clearly unhelpful habits and behaviors. Social influence is generally perceived to be harmless when it respects the right of the influenced to accept or reject it, and is not unduly coercive. Depending on the context and motivations, social influence may constitute underhanded manipulation.

==Requirements for successful manipulation==
According to psychology author [[George K. Simon]], successful psychological manipulation primarily involves the manipulator:&lt;ref name=simon&gt;{{Cite book|title=In Sheep's Clothing: Understanding and Dealing with Manipulative People |first=George K|last=Simon |year=1996 |isbn=978-1-935166-30-6}} (reference for the entire section)&lt;/ref&gt;
# Concealing [[aggression|aggressive]] intentions and behaviors and being affable.
# Knowing the psychological [[vulnerabilities]] of the victim to determine which tactics are likely to be the most effective.
# Having a sufficient level of ruthlessness to have no qualms about causing harm to the victim if necessary.

Consequently, the manipulation is likely to be accomplished through covert aggressive ([[relational aggression|relational aggressive]] or [[passive aggressive]]) means.&lt;ref name=simon/&gt;

==How manipulators control their victims==

===According to Braiker===
Harriet B. Braiker (2004) identified the following ways that manipulators [[Abusive power and control|control]] their victims:&lt;ref name=braiker&gt;{{Cite book|title=Who's Pulling Your Strings ? How to Break The Cycle of Manipulation |first=Harriet B.|last=Braiker |year=2004 |isbn=978-0-07-144672-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Positive reinforcement]]: includes [[praise]], [[superficial charm]], superficial [[sympathy]] ([[crocodile tears]]), excessive apologizing, money, approval, [[gifts]], attention, facial expressions such as a forced laugh or [[smile]], and public recognition.
* [[Negative reinforcement]]: involves removing one from a negative situation as a reward, e.g. "You won't have to do your homework if you allow me to do this to you."
*[[Reinforcement#Intermittent reinforcement; schedules|Intermittent or partial reinforcement]]: Partial or intermittent negative reinforcement can create an effective [[climate of fear]] and doubt. Partial or intermittent positive reinforcement can encourage the victim to persist - for example in most forms of gambling, the gambler is likely to win now and again but still lose money overall.
* [[Punishment (psychology)|Punishment]]: includes [[nagging]], [[screaming|yelling]], the [[silent treatment]], [[intimidation]], threats, [[profanity|swearing]], [[emotional blackmail]], the [[guilt trip]], sulking, crying, and [[playing the victim]].
* Traumatic one-trial learning: using verbal abuse, explosive anger, or other intimidating behavior to establish dominance or superiority; even one incident of such behavior can [[classical conditioning|condition]] or train victims to avoid upsetting, confronting or contradicting the manipulator.

===According to Simon===
Simon identified the following manipulative techniques:&lt;ref name=simon /&gt;&lt;!--All bulleted information in this section is from Simon's book, needing no further citation--&gt;

* [[Lie|Lying]] (by commission) : It is hard to tell if somebody is lying at the time they do it, although often the truth may be apparent later when it is too late. One way to minimize the chances of being lied to is to understand that some personality types (particularly [[psychopaths]]) are experts at the art of lying and [[cheating]], doing it frequently, and often in subtle ways.
* [[Lie#Lying by omission|Lying by omission]]: This is a very subtle form of lying by withholding a significant amount of the truth. This technique is also used in [[propaganda]].
* [[Denial]]: Manipulator refuses to admit that they have done something wrong.
* [[Rationalization (psychology)|Rationalization]]: An excuse made by the manipulator for inappropriate behavior. Rationalization is closely related to [[Spin (public relations)|spin]].
* [[Minimisation (psychology)|Minimization]]: This is a type of denial coupled with rationalization. The manipulator asserts that their behavior is not as harmful or irresponsible as someone else was suggesting, for example, saying that a taunt or insult was only a joke.
* Selective inattention or selective [[attention]]: Manipulator refuses to pay attention to anything that may distract from their agenda, saying things like "I don't want to hear it".
* [[Distraction|Diversion]]: Manipulator not giving a straight answer to a straight question and instead being diversionary, steering the conversation onto another topic.
* [[Evasion (ethics)|Evasion]]: Similar to diversion but giving irrelevant, rambling, vague responses, [[weasel words]].
* Covert [[intimidation]]: Manipulator throwing the victim onto the defensive by using veiled (subtle, indirect or implied) threats.
* [[Guilt trip]]: A special kind of intimidation tactic. A manipulator suggests to the [[conscientious]] victim that they do not care enough, are too selfish or have it easy. This usually results in the victim feeling bad, keeping them in a [[doubt|self-doubting]], [[anxious]] and [[submissive]] position.
* [[Shaming]]: Manipulator uses [[sarcasm]] and put-downs to increase [[fear]] and [[doubt|self-doubt]] in the victim. Manipulators use this tactic to make others feel unworthy and therefore defer to them. Shaming tactics can be very subtle such as a fierce look or glance, unpleasant tone of voice, rhetorical comments, subtle sarcasm. Manipulators can make one feel ashamed for even daring to challenge them. It is an effective way to foster a sense of inadequacy in the victim.
* [[Victim blaming|Vilifying the victim]]: More than any other, this tactic is a powerful means of putting the victim on the defensive while simultaneously masking the aggressive intent of the manipulator, while the manipulator falsely accuses the victim as being an abuser in response when the victim stands up for or defends themselves or their position.
* Playing the victim role: Manipulator portrays themself as a victim of circumstance or of someone else's behavior in order to gain [[pity]], [[sympathy]] or evoke [[compassion]] and thereby get something from another. Caring and conscientious people cannot stand to see anyone suffering and the manipulator often finds it easy to play on sympathy to get cooperation.
* Playing the servant role: Cloaking a self-serving agenda in guise of a service to a more noble cause, for example saying they are acting in a certain way to be "obedient" to or in "service" to an [[authority figure]] or "just doing their job".
* [[Seduction]]: Manipulator uses [[superficial charm|charm]], [[praise]], [[flattery]] or overtly supporting others in order to get them to lower their defenses and give their [[Trust (social sciences)|trust]] and [[loyalty]] to the manipulator. They will also offer help with the intent to gain trust and access to an unsuspecting victim they have charmed.
* [[Psychological projection|Projecting]] the [[blame]] (blaming others): Manipulator [[scapegoats]] in often subtle, hard-to-detect ways. Often, the manipulator will project their own thinking onto the victim, making the victim look like they have done something wrong. Manipulators will also claim that the victim is the one who is at fault for believing lies that they were conned into believing, as if the victim forced the manipulator to be deceitful. All blame, except for the part that is used by the manipulator to accept false guilt, is done in order to make the victim feel guilty about making healthy choices, correct thinking and good behaviors. It is frequently used as a means of psychological and emotional manipulation and control. Manipulators lie about lying, only to re-manipulate the original, less believable story into a "more acceptable" truth that the victim will believe. Projecting lies as being the truth is another common method of control and manipulation. Manipulators love to falsely accuse the victim as "deserving to be treated that way." They often claim that the victim is crazy and/or abusive, especially when there is evidence against the manipulator. (See Feigning, below.)
* Feigning [[innocence]]: Manipulator tries to suggest that any harm done was unintentional or that they did not do something that they were accused of. Manipulator may put on a look of surprise or indignation. This tactic makes the victim question their own [[judgment]] and possibly their own sanity.
* Feigning [[confusion]]: Manipulator tries to play dumb by pretending they do not know what the victim is talking about or is confused about an important issue brought to their attention. The manipulator intentionally confuses the victim in order for the victim to doubt their own accuracy of perception, often pointing out key elements that the manipulator intentionally included in case there is room for doubt. Sometimes manipulators will have used cohorts in advance to help back up their story.
* Brandishing [[anger]]: Manipulator uses anger to brandish sufficient emotional intensity and [[Rage (emotion)|rage]] to shock the victim into submission. The manipulator is not actually angry, they just put on an act. They just want what they want and get "angry" when denied. Controlled anger is often used as a manipulation tactic to avoid confrontation, avoid telling the truth or to further hide intent. There are often threats used by the manipulator of going to police, or falsely reporting abuses that the manipulator intentionally contrived to scare or intimidate the victim into submission. Blackmail and other threats of exposure are other forms of controlled anger and manipulation, especially when the victim refuses initial requests or suggestions by the manipulator. Anger is also used as a defense so the manipulator can avoid telling truths at inconvenient times or circumstances. Anger is often used as a tool or defense to ward off inquiries or suspicion. The victim becomes more focused on the anger instead of the manipulation tactic.
* Bandwagon effect: Manipulator comforts the victim into submission by claiming (whether true or false) that many people already have done something, and the victim should as well. These include phrases such as "Many people like you&amp;nbsp;..." or "Everyone does this anyways." Such manipulation can be seen in [[peer pressure]] situations, often occurring in scenarios where the manipulator attempts to influence the victim into trying [[drugs]] or other substances.

===Vulnerabilities exploited by manipulators===
According to Braiker's self-help book,&lt;ref name=braiker /&gt; manipulators exploit the following vulnerabilities (buttons) that may exist in victims:
* the "disease to please"
* addiction to earning the approval and acceptance of others
* Emotophobia (fear of negative emotion; ''i.e.'' a fear of expressing anger, frustration or disapproval)
* lack of [[assertiveness]] and ability to say no
* blurry sense of identity (with soft [[personal boundaries]])
* low [[Self-sufficiency|self-reliance]]
* external [[locus of control]]

According to Simon,&lt;ref name=simon /&gt; manipulators exploit the following vulnerabilities that may exist in victims:
* naïveté - victim finds it too hard to accept the idea that some people are cunning, devious and ruthless or is "in [[denial]]" if they are being victimized.
* over-[[conscientiousness]] - victim is too willing to give manipulator the benefit of the doubt and see their side of things in which they blame the victim.
* low self-[[confidence]] - victim is [[doubt|self-doubting]], lacking in confidence and [[assertiveness]], likely to go on the defensive too easily.
* over-[[intellectualization]] - victim tries too hard to understand and believes the manipulator has some understandable reason to be hurtful.
* emotional [[codependent|dependency]] - victim has a [[submissive]] or dependent personality. The more emotionally dependent the victim is, the more vulnerable they are to being exploited and manipulated.

Manipulators generally take the time to scope out the characteristics and vulnerabilities of their victims.

Kantor advises in his book ''The Psychopathology of Everyday Life: How to Deal with Manipulative People''&lt;ref name=Kantor&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Psychopathology of Everyday Life: How to Deal with Manipulative People |first=Martin|last=Kantor |year=2006 |isbn=978-0-275-98798-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; that vulnerability to [[psychopathic]] manipulators involves being too:
* [[Dependent personality disorder|dependent]] - dependent people need to be loved and are therefore gullible and liable to say yes to something to which they should say no.
* [[Maturity (psychological)|immature]] - has impaired judgment and so tends to believe exaggerated advertising claims.
* [[naïve]] - cannot believe there are dishonest people in the world, or takes it for granted that if there are any, they will not be allowed to prey on others.
* [[impressionable]] - overly seduced by [[superficial charm|charmers]]. For example, they might vote for the seemingly charming politician who kisses babies.
* [[trusting]] - people who are honest often assume that everyone else is honest. They are more likely to commit themselves to people they hardly know without checking credentials, etc., and less likely to question so-called experts.
* [[Carelessness]] not giving sufficient amount of thought or attention on harm or errors.
* [[Loneliness|lonely]] - lonely people may accept any offer of human contact. A psychopathic stranger may offer human companionship for a price.
* [[narcissistic]] - narcissists are prone to falling for unmerited flattery.
* [[Impulsivity|impulsive]] - make snap decisions about, for example, what to buy or whom to marry without consulting others.
* [[altruistic]] - the opposite of psychopathic: too honest, too fair, too empathetic.
* [[frugal]] - cannot say no to a bargain even if they know the reason it is so cheap.
* [[materialistic]] - easy prey for [[loan sharks]] or [[get-rich-quick]] schemes.
* [[greed]]y - the greedy and dishonest may fall prey to a psychopath who can easily entice them to act in an immoral way.
* [[Masochistic personality disorder|masochistic]] - lack self-respect and so unconsciously let psychopaths take advantage of them. They think they deserve it out of a sense of guilt.
* the [[elderly]] - the elderly can become fatigued and less capable of multi-tasking. When hearing a sales pitch they are less likely to consider that it could be a con. They are prone to giving money to someone with a hard-luck story. See [[elder abuse]].

==Motivations of manipulators==
Manipulators can have various possible motivations, including but not limited to:&lt;ref name=braiker /&gt;
* the need to advance their own purposes and personal gain at virtually any cost to others
* a strong need to attain feelings of [[Abusive power and control|power]] and superiority in relationships with others
* a want and need to feel in [[Abusive power and control|control]]
* a desire to gain a feeling of power over others in order to raise their perception of [[self-esteem]]
* boredom, or growing tired of their surroundings, seeing it as a game more than hurting others
* covert agenda, criminal or otherwise, including financial manipulation (often seen when the elderly or unsuspecting, unprotected wealthy are intentionally targeted for the sole purpose of obtaining a victim's financial assets)

==Psychopathy ==
{{Main article|Psychopathy}}
Being manipulative is in Factor 1 of the [[Hare Psychopathy Checklist]] (PCL).&lt;ref name="gap"&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1177/1529100611426706 |pmid=26167886 |title=Psychopathic Personality: Bridging the Gap Between Scientific Evidence and Public Policy |year=2011 |last1=Skeem |first1=J. L. |last2=Polaschek |first2=D. L. L. |last3=Patrick |first3=C. J. |last4=Lilienfeld |first4=S. O. |journal=Psychological Science in the Public Interest |volume=12 |issue=3 |pages=95–162 |url=http://www.psychologicalscience.org/index.php/publications/journals/pspi/psychopathy.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== In the workplace ===
{{Main article|Psychopathy in the workplace}}
The workplace psychopath may often rapidly shift between emotions – used to manipulate people or cause high anxiety.&lt;ref name=Faggioni&gt;Faggioni M &amp; White M Organizational Psychopaths - Who Are They and How to Protect Your Organization from Them (2009)&lt;/ref&gt;

The authors of the book ''[[Snakes in Suits: When Psychopaths Go to Work]]'' describe a five phase model of how a typical workplace psychopath climbs to and maintains [[Power (social and political)|power]]. In phase three (manipulation) - the psychopath will create a scenario of "[[Cognitive distortion|psychopathic fiction]]" where positive information about themselves and negative [[disinformation]] about others will be created, where your role as a part of a network of [[Flying monkeys (psychology)|pawns or patrons]] will be utilised and you will be [[Operant conditioning|groomed]] into accepting the psychopath's agenda.&lt;ref name=Snakes&gt;Baibak, P; [[Robert D. Hare|Hare, R. D]] [[Snakes in Suits: When Psychopaths Go to Work]] (2007)&lt;/ref&gt;

Corporate jargon Variously known as corporate speak, corporate lingo, business speak, business jargon, management speak, workplace jargon, or commercialese, is the jargon often used in large corporations, bureaucracies, and similar workplaces.[1][2] The use of corporate jargon, also known as "corporatese", is criticised for its lack of clarity as well as for its tedium, making meaning and intention opaque and understanding difficult.
 
Sophism In modern useage sophist and sophistry are redefined and used disparagingly. A sophism is a specious argument for displaying ingenuity in reasoning or for deceiving someone. A sophist is a person who reasons with clever but fallacious and deceptive arguments. 

Impression Management (unethical). In business, "managing impressions" normally "involves someone trying to control the image that a significant stakeholder has of them". The ethics of impression management has been hotly debated on whether we should see it as an effective self-revelation or as cynical manipulation.

==Antisocial, borderline and narcissistic personality disorders==
According to [[Otto Kernberg|Kernberg]], [[Antisocial Personality Disorder|antisocial]], [[Borderline Personality Disorder|borderline]], and [[Narcissistic Personality Disorder|narcissistic]] personality disorders are all organized at a borderline level of personality organization,&lt;ref name="Kernberg75"&gt;{{cite book | title=Borderline Conditions and Pathological Narcissism | publisher=Jason Aronson | author=Kernberg, O | year=1975 | location=New York | isbn=978-0-87668-205-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the three share some common characterological deficits and overlapping personality traits, with deceitfulness and exceptional manipulative abilities being the most common traits among antisocial and narcissism. Borderline is emphasized by unintentional and dysfunctional manipulation, but stigma towards borderlines being deceitful still wrongfully persists.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Stigma and Prejudice|last=Aguirre|first=Blaise|date=2016|publisher=Humana Press, Cham|isbn=9783319275789|series=Current Clinical Psychiatry|pages=133–143|language=en|doi=10.1007/978-3-319-27580-2_8|chapter = Borderline Personality Disorder: From Stigma to Compassionate Care}}&lt;/ref&gt; Antisocials, borderlines, and narcissists are often [[Pathological lying|pathological liars]].&lt;ref name=Kernberg75 /&gt; Other shared traits may include pathological narcissism,&lt;ref name="Kernberg75"/&gt; consistent irresponsibility, [[machiavellianism]], lack of [[empathy]],&lt;ref name="sbc"&gt;{{cite book | title=The Science of Evil: On Empathy and the Origins of Cruelty | publisher=Basic Books | author=Baron-Cohen, S | year=2012 | pages=45–98 | isbn=978-0-465-03142-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; cruelty, [[meanness]], impulsivity, proneness to self-harm and addictions,&lt;ref name="C&amp;C02"&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Casillas, A. |author2=Clark, L.A.k |title=Dependency, impulsivity, and self-harm: traits hypothesized to underlie the association between cluster B personality and substance use disorders |journal=Journal of  Personality Disorders|volume=16 |issue= 5|pages=424–36 |date=October 2002 |pmid=12489309 |doi=10.1521/pedi.16.5.424.22124}}&lt;/ref&gt; interpersonal exploitation, hostility, anger and rage, vanity, emotional instability, rejection sensitivity, perfectionism, and the use of primitive [[defence mechanisms]] that are pathological and narcissistic. Common [[narcissistic defences]] include [[Splitting (psychology)|splitting]], [[denial]], [[Psychological projection|projection]], [[projective identification]], primitive [[idealization and devaluation]], [[Cognitive distortion|distortion]] (including [[exaggeration]], [[Minimisation (psychology)|minimization]] and [[lie]]s), and [[omnipotence]].&lt;ref name=OK93&gt;{{cite book|last1=Kernberg|first1=O.|title=Severe Personality Disorders: Psychotherapeutic Strategies|date=1993|publisher=Yale University Press|isbn=978-0-300-05349-4|pages=15–18|edition=New}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Psychologist [[Marsha M. Linehan]] has stated that people with borderline personality disorder often exhibit behaviors which are not truly manipulative, but are erroneously interpreted as such.&lt;ref name=marsha2222&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.toddlertime.com/mh/terms/manipulation.htm |title=On Manipulation with the Borderline Personality |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |website=ToddlerTime Network |accessdate=28 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to her, these behaviors often appear as unthinking manifestations of intense pain, and are often not deliberate as to be considered truly manipulative. In the [[DSM-V]], manipulation was removed as a defining characteristic of borderline personality disorder.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Stigma and Prejudice|last=Aguirre|first=Blaise|date=2016|publisher=Humana Press, Cham|isbn=9783319275789|series=Current Clinical Psychiatry|pages=133–143|language=en|doi=10.1007/978-3-319-27580-2_8|chapter = Borderline Personality Disorder: From Stigma to Compassionate Care}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Manipulative behavior is intrinsic to narcissists, who use manipulation to obtain power and [[narcissistic supply]]. Those with antisocial personalities will manipulate for material items, power, revenge, and a wide variety of other reasons.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|American Psychiatric Association|2000}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Histrionic personality disorder==
{{Main article|Histrionic personality disorder}}
People with histrionic personality disorder are usually high-functioning, both socially and professionally. They usually have good [[social skills]], despite tending to use them to manipulate others into making them the center of attention.&lt;ref name=Cleveland&gt;{{cite web | publisher=The Cleveland Clinic | title =Histrionic Personality Disorder | url=http://www.clevelandclinic.org/health/health-info/docs/3700/3795.asp?index=9743 | accessdate=23 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Machiavellianism==
{{Main article|Machiavellianism|Machiavellian intelligence}}
Machiavellianism is a term that some [[Social psychology|social]] and [[Personality psychology|personality]] psychologists use to describe a person's tendency to be unemotional, and therefore able to detach themselves from conventional morality and hence to [[deceive]] and manipulate others. In the 1960s, Richard Christie and Florence L. Geis developed a test for measuring a person's level of Machiavellianism (sometimes referred to as the ''Machiavelli test'').&lt;ref&gt;Christie, R., and F. L. Geis. (1970) "How devious are you? Take the Machiavelli test to find out." ''Journal of Management in Engineering'' 15.4: 17.&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''RADECS''' association is a [[non-profit]] [[professional organization]] that promotes basic and applied research in the field of radiation and its effects on materials, components and systems. The acronym RADECS stands for "RADiations Effects on Components and Systems".

Its activities are as follows:
* RADECS biannual European Conference 
* Biannual Technical Workshop
* Promote research activities on radiation effects due to charged, un-charged particles and [[ionizing radiation]]
* Scientific publications or promotion of scientific publications
* Cooperation and exchange with other organizations (''e.g.'' [[IEEE Nuclear and Plasma Sciences Society]])

==History==
The first “Radiation and its Effects on Components and Systems" (RADECS) conference was held in [[Montpellier]], [[France]] in 1989 as a French national conference. In 1991, the members of the organizing committee expanded the scope of RADECS to become a European conference.&lt;ref&gt;Participation of the European Space Agency : https://escies.org/webdocument/showArticle?id=983&lt;/ref&gt; Since then, the RADECS Conference and RADECS Workshop have run in alternate years.

==RADECS conferences==

The RADECS conference and workshops address technical issues related to radiation effects on devices, integrated circuits, sensors, and systems, as well as [[radiation hardening]], testing, and environmental modeling methods.  Papers from the events are published in a biennial issue of the IEEE Transactions on Nuclear Science journal.&lt;ref&gt;http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/conhome.jsp?punumber=1000608&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''RapidIO''' architecture is a high-performance [[Packet switching|packet-switched]], 
[[Electrical connection|interconnect]] technology.  '''RapidIO''' supports messaging, read/write and [[cache coherency]] semantics.  RapidIO fabrics guarantee in-order packet delivery, enabling power- and area- efficient protocol
implementation in hardware.  Based on industry-standard electrical specifications such as those for [[Ethernet]], 
RapidIO can be used as a chip-to-chip, board-to-board, and chassis-to-chassis interconnect. The protocol is marketed as: ''RapidIO - the unified fabric for Performance Critical Computing'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rapidio.org|title=RapidIO.org I Open Standard Interconnect Architecture|website=RapidIO.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; and is used in many applications such as Data Center &amp; HPC, Communications Infrastructure, Industrial Automation and Military &amp; Aerospace that are constrained by at least one of size, weight, and power (SWaP).

== History ==
RapidIO has its roots in energy-efficient, high-performance computing.
The protocol was originally designed by [[Mercury Computer Systems]] and [[Motorola]] ([[Freescale]]) as a replacement for Mercury's RACEway proprietary bus and Freescale's PowerPC bus.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Fuller |first=Sam |date=27 December 2004 |title=RapidIO: The Embedded System Interconnect |url=https://www.amazon.com/RapidIO-The-Embedded-System-Interconnect/dp/0470092912/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1412905011&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=rapidio |location= |publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons Ltd |chapter=Preface |isbn=0-470-09291-2 |accessdate=9 October 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The RapidIO Trade Association was formed in February 2000, and included telecommunications and storage OEMs as well as FPGA, processor, and switch companies. 
The protocol was designed to meet the following objectives:
* Low latency
* Guaranteed, in order, packet delivery
* Support for messaging and read/write semantics
* Could be used in systems with fault tolerance/high availability requirements
* Flow control mechanisms to manage short-term (less than 10 microseconds), medium-term (tens of microseconds) and long-term (hundreds of microseconds to milliseconds) congestion
* Efficient protocol implementation in hardware
* Low system power
* Scales from two to thousands of nodes

The RapidIO Specification Revision 1.1, released in 2001, defined a wide, parallel bus. This specification did not achieve extensive commercial adoption.

The RapidIO Specification Revision 1.2, released in 2002,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.rapidio.org/rapidio-specifications/#tab1752 |title=RapidIO Standard Revision 1.2 |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |date=26 June 2002 |website=www.rapidio.org |publisher=RapidIO Trade Association |accessdate=9 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; defined a serial interconnect based on the XAUI physical layer.

=== RapidIO used in wireless infrastructure ===
RapidIO fabrics enjoy dominant market share in global deployment of cellular infrastructure 3G, 4G &amp; LTE networks with millions of RapidIO ports shipped&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rcrwireless.com/20121203/opinion/reader-forum-cloud-radio-access-small-cell-networks-based-rapidio|title=Reader Forum: Cloud radio access and small cell networks based on RapidIO|website=www.rcrwireless.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; into wireless base stations worldwide. RapidIO fabrics were originally designed to support connecting different types of processors from different manufacturers together in a single system. This flexibility has driven the widespread use of RapidIO in wireless infrastructure equipment where there is a need to combine heterogeneous, DSP, FPGA and communication processors together in a tightly coupled system with low latency and high reliability.

=== RapidIO used in data center / HPC analytics ===
Data Center and HPC Analytics systems have been deployed using a RapidIO 2D Torus Mesh Fabric,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hpcwire.com/2014/09/24/paypal-finds-order-chaos-hpc/|title=PayPal Finds Order from Chaos with HPC|date=24 September 2014|website=hpcwire.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; that provides a high speed general purpose interface among the system cartridges for applications that benefit from high bandwidth, low latency node-to-node communication.  The RapidIO 2D Torus unified fabric is routed as a torus ring configuration connecting up to 45 server cartridges capable of providing 5Gbs per lane connections in each direction to its north, south, east and west neighbors. This allows the system to meet many unique HPC applications where efficient localized traffic is needed.

Also, using an open modular data center and compute platform,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://prodrive-technologies.com/prodrive-technologies-announces-datacenter-hpc-system-dccp-280-rapidio-10-gigabit-ethernet/|title=Prodrive Technologies announces its Datacenter - HPC system (DCCP-280) with RapidIO &amp; 10 Gigabit Ethernet - Prodrive Technologies|date=30 January 2014|website=prodrive-technologies.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; a heterogeneous HPC system has showcased the low latency attribute of RapidIO to enable real-time analytics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20141118005342/en/IDT-Orange-Silicon-Valley-NVIDIA-Accelerate-Computing#.VQqdHuF0Uso|title=IDT, Orange Silicon Valley, NVIDIA Accelerate Computing Breakthrough With RapidIO-based Clusters Ideal for Gaming, Analytics|website=businesswire.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; In March 2015 a top-of-rack switch was announced to drive RapidIO into mainstream data center applications.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://prodrive-technologies.com/prodrive-technologies-launches-prsb-760g2-large-rapidio-networks/|title=Prodrive Technologies Launches PRSB-760G2 for large RapidIO networks - Prodrive Technologies|date=2 March 2015|website=prodrive-technologies.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== RapidIO in aerospace ===
The interconnect or "bus" is one of the critical technologies in the design and development of spacecraft avionic systems that dictates its architecture and level of complexity.  There are a host of existing architectures that are still in use given their level of maturity.  These existing systems are sufficient for a given type of architecture need and requirement.  Unfortunately, for next generation missions a more capable avionics architecture is desired; which is well beyond the capabilities levied by existing architectures.  A viable option toward the design and development of these next generation architectures is to leverage existing commercial protocols capable of accommodating high levels of data transfer.

In 2012, RapidIO was selected by the Next Generation Spacecraft Interconnect Standard (NGSIS) working group to serve as the foundation for standard communication interconnects to be used in spacecraft. The NGSIS is an umbrella standards effort that includes RapidIO Version 3.1 development, and a box level hardware standards effort under VITA 78 called SpaceVPX or High ReliabilityVPX. The NGSIS requirements committee developed extensive requirements criteria with 47 different elements for the NGSIS interconnect. Independent trade study results by NGSIS member companies demonstrated the superiority of RapidIO over other existing commercial protocols, such as InfiniBand, Fibre Channel, and 10G Ethernet. As a result, the group decided that RapidIO offered the best overall interconnect for the needs of next-generation spacecraft.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.responsivespace.com/Papers/RS2013/Sessions/SESSION%20I/1005_Collier/1005P.pdf |title= Next Generation Space Interconnect Standard (NGSIS): A Modular Open Standards Approach for High Performance Interconnects for Space |author=Patrick Collier |date=14 October 2013 |page=5  |publisher=Reinventing Space Conference |accessdate=9 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The RapidIO Specification Revision 3.1, released in 2014,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.rapidio.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/RapidIO-3.1-Specification.pdf |title=RapidIO Standard Revision 3.1 |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |date=13 October 2014 |website=www.rapidio.org |publisher=RapidIO Trade Association |accessdate=18 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;  was developed through a collaboration between the RapidIO Trade Association and NGSIS.  Revision 3.1 has the following enhancements compared to the 3.0 specification:
* MECS Time Synchronization protocol for smaller embedded systems.  MECS Time Synchronization supports redundant time sources.  This protocol is lower cost than the Timestamp Synchronization Protocol introduced in revision 3.0
* [[Pseudorandom binary sequence|PRBS]] test facilities and standard register interface.
* Structurally Asymmetric Link behavioral definition and standard register interface.  Structurally Asymmetric Links carry much more data in one direction than the other, for applications such as sensors or processing pipelines.  Unlike dynamic asymmetric links, Structurally Asymmetric Links allow implementers to remove lanes on boards and in silicon, saving size, weight, and power.  Structurally asymmetric links also allow the use of alternative lanes in the case of a hardware failure on a multi-lane port.
* Extended error log to capture a series of errors for diagnostic purposes
* Space device profiles for endpoints and switches, which define what it means to be a space-compliant RapidIO device.

=== RapidIO specification 4.0 ===
The RapidIO Specification Revision 4.0 was released in 2016.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt; has the following changes and improvements compared to the 3.x specifications:
* The addition of 25.3125 Gbaud line rate, based in industry standard 802.3 electrical standards for short reach&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://standards.ieee.org/news/2015/ieee_802.3bm.html |title= IEEE Standard IEEE Std 802.3bm™-2015 Amendment IEEE Std 802.3™-2012 as amended by IEEE Std 802.3bk™-2013 and IEEE Std 802.3bj™-2014 "Amendment 3: Physical Layer Specifications and Management Parameters for 40 Gb/s and 100 Gb/s Operation over Fiber Optic Cables" |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |date=February 16, 2015 |publisher=IEEE |accessdate=24 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; and long reach&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://standards.ieee.org/news/2014/ieee_802_3bj.html |title=IEEE Standard IEEE Std 802.3bj -2014 Amendment to IEEE Std 802.3 -2012 Physical Layer Specifications and Management Parameters for 100 Gb/s Operation Over Backplanes and Copper Cables" |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |date= June 12, 2014 |accessdate=24 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; links. 
* Support 16 physical layer priorities, which allows more complex traffic patterns.
* Support "Error Free Transmission" for high throughput isochronous information transfer.  RapidIO can now be used to transfer up to 25 Gbaud per lane of isochronous traffic, for example, radar and sonar sensor streams, and wirelesss antenna data IQ samples.

=== PHY roadmap ===
The RapidIO roadmap aligns with Ethernet PHY development. RapidIO specifications for 50&amp;nbsp;GBd and higher links are under investigation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.rapidio.org/rapidio-roadmap/ |title= RapidIO Roadmap |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |date=10 June 2012 |page=4 |website=www.rapidio.com |publisher=RapidIO Trade Association |accessdate=9 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Terminology ==
; Link Partner: One end of a RapidIO link.
; Endpoint: A device that can originate and/or terminate RapidIO packets.
; Processing Element: A device which has at least one RapidIO port
; Switch: A device that can route RapidIO packets.

== Protocol overview ==
The RapidIO protocol is defined in a 3-layered specification:
* Physical: Electrical specifications, PCS/PMA, link-level protocol for reliable packet exchange
* Transport: Routing, multicast, and programming model
* Logical: Logical I/O, messaging, global shared memory ([[Non-uniform memory access|CC-NUMA]]), flow control, data streaming

System specifications include:
* System Initialization
* Error Management/Hot Swap

=== Physical layer ===
The RapidIO electrical specifications are based on industry-standard Ethernet and Optical Interconnect Forum standards:
* [[XAUI]] for lane speeds of 1.25, 2.5, and 3.125 GBd (1, 2, and 2.5&amp;nbsp;Gbit/s)
* [[Optical Internetworking Forum|OIF CEI]] 6+ Gbit/s for lane speeds of 5.0 and 6.25 GBd (4 and 5&amp;nbsp;Gbit/s)
* [[10 Gigabit Ethernet|10GBASE-KR]] 802.3-ap (long reach) and 802.3-ba (short reach) for lane speeds of 10.3125 GBd (9.85&amp;nbsp;Gbit/s)

The RapidIO PCS/PMA layer supports two forms of encoding/framing:
* [[8b/10b encoding|8b/10b]] for lane speeds up to 6.25 GBd
* 64b/67b, similar to that used by [[Interlaken (networking)|Interlaken]] for lane speeds over 6.25 GBd

Every RapidIO processing element transmits and receives three kinds of information: Packets, control symbols, and an idle sequence.

==== Packets ====
Every packet has two values that control the physical layer exchange of that packet. The first is an acknowledge ID (ackID), which is the link-specific, unique, 5-, 6-, or 12-bit value that is used to track packets exchanged on a link. Packets are transmitted with serially increasing ackID values. Because the ackID is specific to a link, the ackID is not covered by CRC, but by protocol. This allows the ackID to change with each link it passes over, while the packet CRC can remain a constant end-to-end integrity check of the packet. When a packet is successfully received, it is acknowledged using the ackID of the packet. A transmitter must retain a packet until it has been successfully acknowledged by the link partner.

The second value is the packet's physical priority.  The physical priority is composed of the Virtual Channel (VC) identifier bit, the Priority bits, and the Critical Request Flow (CRF) bit.  The VC bit determines if the Priority and CRF bits identify a Virtual Channel from 1 to 8, or are used as the priority within Virtual Channel 0.  Virtual Channels are assigned guaranteed minimum bandwidths.  Within Virtual Channel 0, packets of higher priority can pass packets of lower priority.  Response packets must have a physical priority higher than requests in order to avoid deadlock.

The physical layer contribution to RapidIO packets is a 2-byte header at the beginning of each packet that includes the ackID and physical priority, and a final 2-byte CRC value to check the integrity of the packet.  Packets larger than 80 bytes also have an intermediate CRC after the first 80 bytes.  With one exception a packet's CRC value(s) acts as an end-to-end integrity check.

==== Control symbols ====
RapidIO control symbols can be sent at any time, including within a packet.  This gives RapidIO the lowest possible in-band control path latency, enabling the protocol to achieve high throughput with smaller buffers than other protocols.

Control symbols are used to delimit packets (Start of Packet, End of Packet, Stomp), to acknowledge packets (Packet Acknowledge, Packet Not Acknowledged), reset (Reset Device, Reset Port) and to distribute events within the RapidIO system (Multicast Event Control Symbol).  Control symbols are also used for flow control (Retry, Buffer Status, Virtual Output Queue Backpressure) and for error recovery.

The error recovery procedure is very fast.  When a receiver detects a transmission error in the received data stream, the receiver causes its associated transmitter to send a Packet Not Accepted control symbol.  When the link partner receives a Packet Not Accepted control symbol, it stops transmitting new packets and sends a Link Request/Port Status control symbol.  The Link Response control symbol indicates the ackID that should be used for the next packet transmitted.  Packet transmission then resumes.

==== IDLE sequence ====
The IDLE sequence is used during link initialization for signal quality optimization.  It is also transmitted when the link does not have any control symbols or packets to send.

=== Transport layer ===
Every RapidIO endpoint is uniquely identified by a Device Identifier (deviceID).  Each RapidIO packet contains two device IDs.  The first is the destination ID (destID), which indicates where the packet should be routed. The second is the source ID (srcID), which indicates where the packet originated.  When an endpoint receives a RapidIO request packet that requires a response, the response packet is composed by swapping the srcID and destID of the request.

RapidIO switches use the destID of received packets to determine the output port or ports that should forward the packet.  Typically, the destID is used to index into an array of control values.  The indexing operation is fast and low cost to implement.  RapidIO switches support a standard programming model for the routing table, which simplifies system control.

The RapidIO transport layer supports any network topology, from simple trees and meshes to n-dimensional [[hypercube]]s, multi-dimensional [[toroid]]s, and more esoteric architectures such as entangled networks.

The RapidIO transport layer enables hardware virtualization (for example, a RapidIO endpoint can support multiple device IDs).  Portions of the destination ID of each packet can be used to identify specific pieces of virtual hardware within the endpoint.

=== Logical layer ===
The RapidIO logical layer is composed of several specifications, each providing packet formats and protocols for different transaction semantics.

==== Logical I/O ====
The logical I/O layer defines packet formats for read, write, write-with-response, and various atomic transactions.  Examples of atomic transactions are set, clear, increment, decrement, swap, test-and-swap, and compare-and-swap.

==== Messaging ====
The Messaging specification defines Doorbells and Messages.  Doorbells communicate a 16-bit event code.  Messages transfer up to 4KiB of data, segmented into up to 16 packets each with a maximum payload of 256 bytes.  Response packets must be sent for each Doorbell and Message request.  The response packet status value indicates done, error, or retry.  A status of retry requests the originator of the request to send the packet again.  The logical level retry response allows multiple senders to access a small number of shared reception resources, leading to high throughput with low power.

==== Flow control ====
The Flow Control specification defines packet formats and protocols for simple XON/XOFF flow control operations.  Flow control packets can be originated by switches and endpoints.  Reception of a XOFF flow control packet halts transmission of a flow or flows until an XON flow control packet is received or a timeout occurs.  Flow Control packets can also be used as a generic mechanism for managing system resources.

==== CC-NUMA ====
The Globally Shared Memory specification defines packet formats and protocols for operating a cache coherent shared memory system over a RapidIO network.

==== Data streaming ====
The Data Streaming specification supports messaging with different packet formats and semantics than the Messaging specification.  Data Streaming packet formats support the transfer of up to 64K of data, segmented over multiple packets.  Each transfer is associated with a Class of Service and Stream Identifier, enabling thousands of unique flows between endpoints.

The Data Streaming specification also defines Extended Header flow control packet formats and semantics to manage performance within a client-server system.  Each client uses extended header flow control packets to inform the server of the amount of work that could be sent to the server.  The server responds with extended header flow control packets that use XON/XOFF, rate, or credit based protocols to control how quickly and how much work the client sends to the server.

=== System initialization ===
Systems with a known topology can be initialized in a system specific manner without affecting interoperability.  The RapidIO system initialization specification supports system initialization when system topology is unknown or dynamic.  System initialization algorithms support the presence of redundant hosts, so system initialization need not have a single point of failure.

Each system host recursively enumerates the RapidIO fabric, seizing ownership of devices, allocating device IDs to endpoints and updating switch routing tables. When a conflict for ownership occurs, the system host with the larger deviceID wins.  The "losing" host releases ownership of its devices and retreats, waiting for the "winning" host.  The winning host completes enumeration, including seizing ownership of the losing host.  Once enumeration is complete, the winning host releases ownership of the losing host.  The losing host then discovers the system by reading the switch routing tables and registers on each endpoint to learn the system configuration.  If the winning host does not complete enumeration in a known time period, the losing host determines that the winning host has failed and completes enumeration.

System enumeration is supported in Linux by the RapidIO subsystem.

=== Error management ===
RapidIO supports high availability, fault tolerant system design, including hot swap.  The error conditions that require detection, and standard registers to communicate status and error information, are defined.  A configurable isolation mechanism is also defined so that when it is not possible to exchange packets on a link, packets can be discarded to avoid congestion and enable diagnosis and recovery activities.  In-band (port-write packet) and out-of-band (interrupt) notification mechanisms are defined.

== Form factors ==
The RapidIO specification does not discuss the subjects of form factors and connectors, leaving this to specific application-focussed communities.  RapidIO is supported by the following form factors:

* [[Advanced Telecommunications Computing Architecture]]
* [[Advanced Mezzanine Card]]
* [[PCI Mezzanine Card|XMC]]
* [[OpenVPX]]
* [[VXS]]

== Software ==
Processor-agnostic RapidIO support is found in the Linux kernel.

== Applications ==
The RapidIO interconnect is used extensively in the following applications:
* Wireless base stations
* Aerospace and Military [[single-board computer]]s, as well as radar, acoustic and image processing systems
* Video
* Storage
* Supercomputing
* [[Medical imaging]]
* Industrial control and data path applications

RapidIO is expanding into supercomputing, server, and storage applications.

== Competing protocols ==
[[PCI Express]] is targeted at the host to peripheral market, as opposed to embedded systems.  Unlike RapidIO, PCIe is not optimized for peer-to-peer multi processor networks. PCIe is ideal for host to peripheral communication. PCIe does not scale as well in large multiprocessor peer-to-peer systems, as the basic PCIe assumption of a "root complex" creates fault tolerance and system management issues.

Another alternative interconnect technology is [[Ethernet]]. Ethernet is a robust approach to linking computers over large geographic areas, where network topology may change unexpectedly, the protocols used are in flux, and link latencies are large. To meet these challenges, systems based on Ethernet require significant amounts of processing power, software and memory throughout the network to implement protocols for flow control, data transfer, and packet routing. RapidIO is optimized for energy efficient, low latency, processor-to-processor communication in fault tolerant embedded systems that span geographic areas of less than one kilometre.

SpaceFibre is a competing technology for space applications.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://star-dundee.com/sites/default/files/SpaceFibre_0.pdf |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |title=SpaceFibre Overview |publisher=STAR-Dundee |accessdate=21 October 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141022060617/http://star-dundee.com/sites/default/files/SpaceFibre_0.pdf |archivedate=22 October 2014 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[https://www.tttech.com/products/aerospace/flight-rugged-hardware/space-ceramic/tte-switch-controller-space/ Time-Triggered Ethernet]  is a competing technology for more complex backplane (VPX) and backbone applications for space (launchers and human-rated integrated avionics).

'''SITAOnAir''' is a company that enables [[airline]] passengers to use their [[mobile phones]] and [[laptops]] for calls, text messaging, emails and Internet browsing. By May 2014, SITAOnAir’s services were available in over 60 countries and used by 22 airlines flying over five continents.

The company is a fully owned subsidiary of [[SITA (company)|SITA]], originally incorporated as OnAir as a [[joint venture]] with [[Airbus]] in February 2005. In February 2013, Airbus sold its 33% final stake to SITA.&lt;ref name="apex20130211"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://blog.apex.aero/ife/exclusive-airbus-exits-inflight-connectivity-business-sale-onair-stake-sita/ |title=Exclusive: Airbus exits inflight connectivity business with sale of OnAir stake to SITA |author=Mary Kirby |date=11 February 2013 |publisher=APEX |accessdate=12 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The company is headquartered in [[Geneva]], [[Switzerland]], and has operations in [[Seattle]] and sales offices in [[London]], [[Singapore]] and [[Dubai]].

==Services==
SITAOnAir offers many services which aircraft operators can use together or separately:
* '''Flight Operations''' or [[Flight planning]] is the process of producing a [[flight plan]] to describe a proposed aircraft flight.
*'''Internet OnAir''' is a Wi-Fi network which offers Internet access at broadband speed to passengers.&lt;ref name="aaco.org"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.aaco.org/partnerdetails.aspx?pageid=378|title=Global Distribution Systems &amp; Technology Partners}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
*'''Mobile OnAir''' is a cellphone service which offers mobile telephony, SMS and narrowband Internet access (56 kbit/s) and so allows passengers to make and receive calls on their mobile phones, send and receive text messages and emails and use the [[Internet]]. Airlines can restrict usage of these services at discretion enabling them to ban voice calls and allow only SMS and Internet access instead. [[Lufthansa]] is one airline following this restrictive approach due to passengers' alleged desire for quiet during flights.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.focus.de/reisen/fliegen/lufthansa-ja-zur-sms-im-flieger-nein-zu-telefonaten_aid_667857.html |title=Lufthansa: Ja zur SMS im Flieger, nein zu Telefonaten |author=Focus |date=22 September 2011 |publisher=Focus |accessdate=14 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*'''Link OnAir'''' is a managed network service that allows airlines to use the IP-based satellite connection used by the aforementioned services for other applications, such as supplying [[In-flight entertainment|in-flight entertainment systems]] with news content or Internet access and providing mission-critical information and communication services to air crews.&lt;ref name="aaco.org"/&gt;
*'''OnAir Play'''' combines inflight connectivity with films, TV, live news, music, games, magazines and newspapers. Passengers have access to a full range of content including live news and sport, updated throughout the flight and can buy destination-based goods and services to ease their arrival.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.getconnected.aero/2014/05/philippine-airlines-launch-customer-onair-play|title=Philippine Airlines to be launch customer for OnAir Play}}&lt;/ref&gt;

All three services share the same satellite connection to the ground. SITAOnAir (then OnAir) was the first company to provide integrated [[GSM]] and inflight wifi services, with [[Oman Air]] as the launch airline in March 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.meed.com/sectors/transport/aviation-and-airports/oman-air-launches-full-mobile-phone-and-wi-fi-connectivity-aboard-new-airbus-a330s/3056602.article |title=Oman Air launches full mobile phone and wi-fi connectivity aboard new Airbus A330s}}&lt;/ref&gt; SITAOnAir’s technology has been certified for use on many types of aircraft – both private and commercial jets including [[Boeing]] and [[Airbus]] – for short and long haul. In most cases, it is available for linefit or retrofit.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.sita.aero/content/the-new-inflight-must-have-an-interview-with-onair-ceo-ian-dawkins |title=The new inflight 'must have': An interview with OnAir CEO Ian Dawkins }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Technology==
[[File:Airbus A320 with satellite antenna radome.svg|thumb|320px|typical location of satellite antenna radome|right]]SITAOnAir's onboard system is based on a [[Wi-Fi|Wi-Fi access point]] and/or a [[GSM]] [[picocell]] connected to the ground through a satellite link. All onboard equipment, except for the satellite antenna, fits into a hand-luggage compartment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://blog.apex.aero/ife/emirates-puts-emphasis-inflight-live-television-mammoth-deal-panasonic-revealed|title=Emirates puts emphasis on inflight live television as mammoth deal with Panasonic is revealed}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Satellite Link===
SITAOnAir offers the satellite connectivity required for its onboard services using Inmarsat's [[SwiftBroadband]] service operating in the [[L band]] and prospectively Inmarsat's K&lt;sub&gt;a&lt;/sub&gt; band-based [[Inmarsat#Global Xpress|Global Xpress]] system which is expected to be launched in 2015. However customers are free to use third-party services for the backhaul to the ground. 90% of the onboard equipment can be used with any radio link, for example other satellite networks or a direct air-to-ground link.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://blog.apex.aero/ife/inmarsats-swiftbroadband-swifter-airlines-business-jets|title=Inmarsat’s SwiftBroadband is about to get swifter for airlines, business jet operators|author=Mary Kirby |date=21 August 2012 |publisher=APEX }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Due to the limited bandwidth of only 864 kbit/s offered by SITAOnAir today and its inability to feed in live television in February 2013 [[Emirates (airline)|Emirates]], one of SITAOnAir's largest customers, has selected a [[Ku band|K&lt;sub&gt;u&lt;/sub&gt; band]]-based service provided by SITAOnAir's rival [[Panasonic Avionics Corporation|Panasonic Avionics]] (''Global Communications Suite'' (GCS)) for its fleet of [[Boeing 777]]s and future [[Airbus A380]] deliveries, while existing Airbus A380s for now remain connected through SITAOnAir's service.&lt;ref name="apex20130211" /&gt;&lt;ref name="apex20130208"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://blog.apex.aero/ife/emirates-puts-emphasis-inflight-live-television-mammoth-deal-panasonic-revealed/ |title=Emirates puts emphasis on inflight live television as mammoth deal with Panasonic is revealed |author=Mary Kirby |date=8 February 2013 |publisher=APEX |accessdate=14 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Inmarsat SwiftBroadband (L band)====
A satellite data unit (SDU) manufactured by [[Thales Group|Thales]] and branded ''TopConnect'' establishes a [[Backhaul (telecommunications)|backhaul link]] to the ground through Inmarsat's [[SwiftBroadband]] [[Geostationary orbit|geostationary]] [[satellite constellation]] operating in the [[L band]] around 1500&amp;nbsp;MHz which allows the use of electronically steerable antennas mounted atop the aircraft fuselage and encased within a fiberglass, RF-transparent radome
that have a low profile compared to systems operating in the [[Ku band|K&lt;sub&gt;u&lt;/sub&gt; band]] or [[Ka band|K&lt;sub&gt;a&lt;/sub&gt; band]] which today still require mechanically steerable antennas with a significantly higher profile. Thus drag and fuel costs are reduced allowing economical operation even on smaller aircraft like business or regional jets.
Inmarsat's SwiftBroadband system covers much of the planet except for the polar regions above −82 and below +82 degrees latitude and currently provides symmetric data rates of up to 432 kbit/s per channel dependent on signal quality and overall load on the satellite's spotbeam serving the corresponding geographical area. Currently the Thales SDU can bond two channels resulting in a maximum bandwidth of 864 kbit/s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.aircraftinteriorsinternational.com/news.php?NewsID=20140/|title=Thales launches connectivity demonstrator suite}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Inmarsat GlobalXpress (K&lt;sub&gt;a&lt;/sub&gt; band)====
There is also a clear upgrade path from SwiftBroadband to Inmarsat's [[Inmarsat#Global Xpress|Global Xpress]] system, a constellation of three [[Ka band|K&lt;sub&gt;a&lt;/sub&gt; band]] satellites which will come on stream in 2014-2015 and will globally provide downlink bandwidths of up to 50 Mbit/s.
SITAOnAir was appointed as distribution partner for Inmarsat's Global Xpress service in November 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.onair.aero/sites/default/files/press_release_pdfs/OnAir%20and%20GX%20-%20FINAL.pdf |title=OnAir selected by Inmarsat as Global Xpress Distribution Partner  |author=OnAir |date=29 November 2011 |publisher=OnAir |accessdate=14 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Onboard Server===
A server installed onboard manages the satellite connection and routes the data traffic while also compressing and decompressing all data transmitted, including GSM phone calls that are recoded using the [[Adaptive Multi-Rate audio codec|AMR codec]] which reduces bandwidth while maintaining a voice quality virtually indistinguishable from the native [[GSM#Voice codecs|GSM codec]].

===Wi-Fi Network===
Broadband Internet access ('''Internet OnAir''') is provided by [[Wi-Fi]] access points. In order to access SITAOnAir's Wi-Fi Internet service (Internet SITAOnAir) passengers need to bring a Wi-Fi compatible device. Access can usually be purchased on board.

===GSM Network===
A [[picocell]] operating according to the [[GSM frequency bands#GSM-1800|GSM-1800 standard]] provides a GSM network ('''Mobile OnAir''') enabling voice telephony, [[SMS]] and narrowband Internet access ([[GPRS]]). The GSM signal is distributed by a [[Traveling wave antenna|leaky line antenna]], essentially a coaxial cable with a slotted shielding through which RF signals are radiated. This coaxial cable is installed above the ceiling panels along the whole aircraft cabin and provides a uniform linear coverage of the aircraft cabin at very low radiation power levels. In order to prevent handsets from connecting to terrestrial networks which would lead to high transmission power levels a so-called ''network control unit'' (NCU) installed onboard generates a broadband noise floor which is being emitted through the existing leaky line antenna masking reception of terrestrial mobile networks within the aircraft. These measures ensure that handsets can only connect to the onboard GSM network and will then operate with the lowest possible transmission power level (GSM-1800 power control level 15, nominal output power of 0 dBm) which results in significantly lower radiation levels than those experienced on average when using a mobile phone with terrestrial networks on the ground.
The GSM network is being realized based on [[Monaco Telecom|Monaco Telecom's]] core network. It uses the [[List of mobile country codes|MCC]] / [[Mobile Network Code#International|MNC]] tuple 901-15 assigned to SITA, one of SITAOnAir's two owners, in March 2005.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.itu.int/dms_pub/itu-t/opb/sp/T-SP-OB.832-2005-PDF-E.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

====Passenger Equipment Compatibility====
SITAOnAir's inflight cellphone service (Mobile OnAir) requires a mobile phone supporting the GSM-1800 standard, also called DCS (Digital Cellular Service), which most modern GSM phones support as well as a SIM card from a network operator having a [[Roaming|roaming agreement]] with Monaco Telcom. So-called [[Multi-band#Quad-band|quad-band]] handsets always support GSM-1800 and so are compatible with Mobile OnAir.

===IFE Connectivity===
The system can also provide IP-based connectivity to existing [[in-flight entertainment|in-flight entertainment systems]] which allows news content to be fed in and messaging services as well as Internet access to be offered on in-seat units.

[[File:Édouard-Henri Avril (2).jpg|thumb|Pillows are often used in the [[missionary position]].]] 
A '''sex pillow''' is a specially-designed and typically firm [[pillow]] used to enhance [[sexual intercourse]]. An ordinary firm pillow, however, may be used in place of a special one. Some contain a high-density [[polyurethane|urethane]] core to balance firm support with softness. In addition to more common pillow shapes, there are wedge-shaped, ramp-shaped, prism-shaped, etc. pillows which lend themselves to various sexual positions, some of which might be difficult or uncomfortable without them.

A pillow can be used to provide support when one partner has back pain.&lt;ref&gt;Bechtel, Stefan and Stains, Larry: ''Sex: A Man's Guide'', p. 322.&lt;/ref&gt; A very common use of a sex pillow is to place it under the woman's buttocks or hips before assuming the [[missionary position]]; this pivots the pelvis and increases depth of penetration.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eioba.com/a70097/interesting_sex_positions|title=Interesting sex positions&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Space Telescope Imaging Spectrograph''' ('''STIS''') is a [[spectrograph]], also with a camera mode, installed on the [[Hubble Space Telescope]]. [[Aerospace engineer]] [[Bruce Woodgate]] of the [[Goddard Space Flight Center]] was the principal investigator and creator of the STIS.&lt;ref name=cbsnews&gt;{{cite news|first=Leezel |last=Tanglao |title=Inventor of the camera used on Hubble telescope has died |url=http://www.cbsnews.com/news/astronomer-bruce-woodgate-inventor-of-the-camera-used-on-hubble-telescope-has-died/ |work=[[CBS News]] |publisher= |date=2014-05-01 |accessdate=2014-05-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=eherald&gt;{{cite news|first=|last=|title=Tributes paid to man who changed the face of space |url=http://www.eastbourneherald.co.uk/news/local/tributes-paid-to-man-who-changed-the-face-of-space-1-6047654 |work=[[Eastbourne Herald]] |publisher= |date=2014-05-09 |accessdate=2014-05-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; It operated continuously from 1997 until a power supply failure in August 2004.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.newscientist.com/article/dn9457-nasa-attempts-to-revive-hubbles-main-camera/]&lt;/ref&gt; After repairs, it began operating again in 2009. The spectrograph has made many important observations, including the first spectrum of the [[Celestial body atmosphere|atmosphere]] of an [[extrasolar planet]], [[HD 209458b]].

The STIS was installed on Hubble in 1997 during its second servicing mission ([[STS-82]])  by [[Mark C. Lee|Mark Lee]] and [[Steven Smith (astronaut)|Steven Smith]], replacing the [[High Resolution Spectrograph]] and the [[Faint Object Spectrograph]].  It was designed to operate for five years.  On August 3, 2004 an electronic failure rendered STIS inoperable, ending its use 2 years beyond its predicted lifespan. In order to bring it back to operational status, the instrument was repaired by space shuttle astronauts during [[STS-125]], Servicing Mission 4, launched on May 11, 2009.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/hubble/servicing/SM4/main/STOCC_update_05172009_FD7.html|title=Space Telescope Operations Control Center — Flight Day 7|date=May 17, 2009|publisher=[[NASA]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; The crew did a long (many hour) EVA to repair the instrument.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nasaspaceflight.com/2009/05/sts-125-eva-4-stis-repair-atlantis-tps-overview/]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Design==
The STIS has three 1024×1024 detector arrays.  The first is a charge-coupled device with a 52×52 arc-second field of view, covering the visible and near-infrared spectrum from 200&amp;nbsp;nm to 1030&amp;nbsp;nm.  The other two detectors are Multi-Anode Multichannel Arrays, each with a 25×25 arc-second field of view.  One is Cs&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Te, and covers the near-UV between 160&amp;nbsp;nm and 310&amp;nbsp;nm.  The other is CsI and covers the far-UV between 115&amp;nbsp;nm and 170&amp;nbsp;nm.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=STIS Instrument Detectors|url=http://www.stsci.edu/hst/stis/design/detectors/|publisher=[[Space Telescope Science Institute]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; STIS is both a spectrograph and an imaging camera, and is focused on ultraviolet light.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nasaspaceflight.com/2009/05/sts-125-eva-4-stis-repair-atlantis-tps-overview/]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:_trapiche2.jpg|thumb|250x250px|Trapiche in the island of [[Hispaniola|The Hispaniola]] in an engraving of the 17th century]]
A '''trapiche''' is a [[Mill (grinding)|mill]] made of wooden rollers used to extract [[juice]] from fruit, originally olives, and since the [[Middle Ages]], [[Saccharum officinarum|sugar cane]] as well. By extension the word is also sometimes applied to the location of the mill, whether the workshop or the entire plantation.&lt;ref&gt;«[http://www.histo.cat/1/Trapiche-MWebster.JPG Merriam-Webster: trapiche]».&amp;#x20;&lt;/ref&gt;

==Etymology== 
The word has its origin in the [[Latin]] ''[[wikt:trapētus|trapetum]]'' that means oil mill.&lt;ref&gt;[http://de.pons.eu/dict/search/results/?q=Trapetus&amp;l=dela&amp;in=&amp;lf=la «trapetum»], Pons Latein-Deutsches Wörterbuch&lt;/ref&gt; From the [[Sicilian language]] ''trapetto&lt;ref name="cves"&gt;[[Charles Verlinden]] &amp; Eberhard Schmitt, ''Die mittelalterlichen Ursprünge der europäischen Expansion,'' tom I de ''Dokumente zur Geschichte der europäischen Expansion,'' Wiesbaden, Otto Harrassowitz Verlag, 1986, pàgina 169, {{ISBN|9783406303722}}&lt;/ref&gt;'' the term, crossing the [[Mozarabs|Mozarab]] [[Kingdom of Valencia|Valencia]], with its typical change of termination to «-ig» via the [[Catalan language]] (''trapig'' -Gandía, 1536-, ''trapitz de canyamel'' -Mallorca, 1466-)&lt;ref name="Corominas"&gt;[http://histo.cat/1/Trapiche-Discurso_ingreso_Antonio_Tovar_Llorente_opt.pdf#page=19 Corominas: trapig en Gandía, 1536, y trapitz de canyamel en Mallorca, 1466]&lt;/ref&gt; has arrived to the other languages of the [[Iberian Peninsula|Iberian peninsula]] as ''trapiche.&lt;ref&gt;&lt;span&gt;«&lt;/span&gt;[http://dcvb.iec.cat/results.asp?Word=trapig trapig] &lt;span&gt;». &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;'' In the documents of the [[Duke of Gandía]] from the beginning of the fifteen century, one can see the term «trapig de canyamel», as a [[synecdoche]] to indicate the whole village [[engenho]].&lt;ref name="cves" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Hugo I, Duke of Gandia|Hug de Cardona]] editat per Frederic Aparisi Romero, ''III: Col·lecció diplomàtica (1407-1482)'' Fonts Històriques Valencianes, València, Universitat de València, 2011, pàgina 1058 ss., {{ISBN|9788437083025}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Herrera: ''"..es de notar que antiguamente no auuia azucar,ſino en Valencia"'' ("note that in the old days there was no sugar except in Valencia").&lt;ref name="Tordesillas1601"&gt;{{cite book|author=Antonio de Herrera y Tordesillas|title=Historia General De Los Hechos De Los Castellanos En Las Islas Itierra Firme Del Mar Oceano: Decada Segvnda|url=https://books.google.es/books?id=Pr1fAAAAcAAJ&amp;pg=PA105&amp;dq=herrera+no+auia+azucar+sino+en+valencia&amp;hl=ca&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjzu-eNzPrMAhVLiRoKHXUQAP8Q6AEIJDAA#v=onepage&amp;q=herrera%20no%20auia%20azucar%20sino%20en%20valencia&amp;f=false|year=1601|publisher=Por Juan Flamenco|pages=105–}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!--== Valencian Country ==

To the second half of the 15th century [[Hugo I, Duke of Gandia|Hug of Cardona and Gandia]] yielded the monopoly of the exploitation of the sugar to Gandia to the negociants of the ''Magna Societas Alemannorum'' of Ravensburg.&lt;ref name="cves"&gt;Charles Verlinden &amp; Eberhard Schmitt, ''Die mittelalterlichen Ursprünge der europäischen Expansion,'' tom I de ''Dokumente zur Geschichte der europäischen Expansion,'' Wiesbaden, Otto Harrassowitz Verlag, 1986, pàgina 169, ISBN 9783406303722&lt;/ref&gt; In the year 1500 the sector gave work to some 500 people and 220 animals.

Many factors contributed to the declí of the trapiches and of the industry sucrera to Gandia. To the XVI appeared «the engine», a more eficient and faster team. It continued declining with the increase of the competition of [[Madeira]], of the [[Canary Islands]] and of the [[Antilles]] that had a [[climate]] more idoni.&lt;ref name="agg"&gt;Andrea González Garrigas, [http://metode.cat/Noticies/Entrevistes/Entrevista-a-Ana-Labarta-sobre-la-canya-de-sucre#nota1 «Entrevista a Ana Labarta sobre la canya de sucre, Catedràtica d’Estudis Àrabs i Islàmics i professora del Departament de Filologia Catalana de la Facultat de Filologia, Traducció i Comunicació de la Universitat de València.]&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Expulsion of the Moriscos|expulsion of the moriscos]] the October [[October 4|4]], [[1609]] was the fatal blow to an industry already in declí.

At the beginning of the fifteenth century, the Conde Oil imported from Sicily method of cultivation of sugarcane and techniques to extract the "çucre" with the help of teachers Sucrers Sicilians.  A certain Galceran Vic, Lord of Xeresa built the first trapig in Gandia . [6] In 1433 it already have four and the end of the fourteenth century. [7] A Member of the Monastery of Valldigna you saw revenue grow trapig its 40% between 1434 and 1502. tentative to introduce a new culture Castellon were less successful. [8] the culture of sugarcane was done mainly by the gentry and the bourgeoisie, such as farmers were not very motivated to change land orchard culture "industrial."  Sugar companies had to take land on lease or encourage owners to spend bourgeois culture cane. [8]

In the second half of the fifteenth century Hug de Cardona Gandia and gave a monopoly of the operation of the sugar merchants of Gandia Magna Societas Alemannorum of Ravensburg . [3] Around 1500 the sector employed about 500 people and 220 animals. Pedro Luis de Borja possessed three and Ausiàs March in had a Beniarjó . [9]

Many factors contributed to the decline of the sugar industry and trapigs Gandia.  In XVI appeared "ingenuity", a computer faster and more efficient.  He continued declining with increased competition from Madeira , the Canary Islands and the Antilles that had a climate more suitable. [10] The expulsion of the Moors on 4 October of 1609 was a fatal blow industry already in decline.  The Moors were the main cane growers and labor expert.  Whole villages were empty.  The decree of Philip III of Spain was a disaster for the region and lead to ruin the ducal house. [6]

Most facilities disappeared.  Today there are only a few vestiges of old materials and trapigs Ingen with the course of time were reformed [6] and intangible assets in the names , for example Trapig Street Gandia, Trapig Plaza in Miramar and Carrera Trapig in Xeresa .  However it seems that today many people forget the glorious past of the sugar industry in the duchy of Gandia 600 years ago. [10]--&gt;

===Canarian precedents===
In the late 15th century, the horizontal two-roller engenho or trapiche transferred seamlessly from the Portuguese in the [[Madeira Islands]] to the [[Canary Islands]] just as the [[Castilians]] (not yet known as [[Spain|Spanish]]), still struggled to control the [[Guanches]], the rebellious indigenous Canarians. They were, in fact, the first coerced workers of the fledgling sugar industry on these islands. As the [[Iberians]] colonized the archipelagos off the coast of [[West Africa]] they relocated here most of the [[Mediterranean]] agricultural industry making of these islands the center of technological advancement in the [[Atlantic World]]. And in a matter of two decades after [[Christopher Columbus]] touched down on the [[Bahamas]], just across the ocean, the trapiche followed [[Conquistadors|European colonists]] to the [[Caribbean]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | url=https://www.academia.edu/26902235/HISTORIA_DE_CANARIAS_de_Viera_y_Clavijo_Vol_2.pdf | title=Historia de Canarias T. 2 | publisher=Islas Canarias: Viceconsejería de Cultura y Deportes, Gobierno de Canarias | author=Viera y Clavijo, José de | year=1991 | location=Las Palmas de Gran Canaria | pages=420 | isbn=8487137962}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The first stop was the island of [[Hispaniola]].

===Hispaniola (Santo Domingo)===
The trapiche's arrival to the Caribbean coincided with three crucial events in the early history of the [[Americas]]. They were the dramatic [[Population history of indigenous peoples of the Americas#Depopulation from disease|decline of the indigenous population]], the arrival of the first [[Slavery in Latin America#Enslaved blacks in Latin America|enslaved Africans]] to the Americas and the sudden drop in the production of gold. While large numbers of colonists sought to escape the ensuing desolation and migrated to settle and desolate in turn other territories, those who stayed on Hispaniola turned to the sugar industry hustled at first by a mixture of enslaved indigenous people and Africans ([[black ladinos|ladinos]] and [[bozales]]).  In a few more years, as the indigenous population retrieved, enslaved Blacks made up the bulk if not all of the coerced workers.  With the promise of personal wealth implied in the system of slavery and with the advice of Canarian experts colonists began establishing some types of engenhos as early as 1514.&lt;ref name="Stevens-Acevedo"&gt;{{cite journal | url=https://www.academia.edu/2349350/The_machines_that_milled_the_sugar-canes._The_horizontal_double_roller_mills_in_the_first_sugar_plantations_of_the_Americas | title=The Machines That Milled the Sugar-Canes:  The Horizontal Double Roller Mills in the First Sugar Plantations of the Americas | author=R. Stevens-Acevedo, Anthony | date=January 2013 | pages=81}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to [[Cronistas de Indias]] (Chroniclers of the Indies), [[Bartolomé de las Casas]] and [[Gonzalo Fernández de Oviedo y Valdés]], it was [[Gonzales de Veloso]] (also, Gonzalez Veloso and Gonzalo de Vellosa) who built in what today is [[San Cristóbal, Dominican Republic|San Cristobal]] the first two-roller trapiche pulled by horses on Hispaniola.&lt;ref name="Las Casas"&gt;{{cite book | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=vp3UAAAAMAAJ | title=Historia de las Indias escrita | publisher=M.

===Three rollers===
Though most current examples of trapiches in the Spanish Caribbean are of the three-rollers, according to scholar Anthony R. Stevens-Acevedo, the horizontal two-roller trapiche was the type used in the Caribbean throughout the end of the 16th century. As this piece of technology moved south to [[Province of Tierra Firme|Tierra Firme]] ([[South America]]), the trapiche not only acquired a new roller, but it also erected all three of them to become a more efficient instrument of the expanding sugar industry. In this more elaborate shape, it soon returned to the Caribbean as the backbone of the sugar engenho.&lt;ref name="Stevens-Acevedo"/&gt;

==South America==

===Sugar cane industry===
[[File:_Ingenio-trapiche-carache.jpg|thumb|250x250px|Trapiche in Carache, [[Trujillo (state)|State of Trujillo]], [[Venezuela]].]]
Nowadays, the majority of the ingenios in Argentina or ([[engenho]]s in Brazil), use a trapiche to grind the [[sugar cane|sugarcane]] and extract its [[sugar|juice]]. They used [[water vapor]] as a driving force for mechanisms. In [[Latin America]] one can see small and transportable "street trapiches" handled by just one person. They can be installed almost anywhere to produce fresh cane juice. Its manufacture is artisanal, having even wooden gears.&lt;ref&gt;[http://trapichesenmadera.jimdo.com/ Wooden trapiches in Colombia]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Mining environment===
In Argentina, [[Bolivia]] and [[Chile]] the term also applies to a type of mill used to reduce to dust different kinds [[mineral]]s.&lt;ref name="prf"&gt;Paola Raquel Figueroa, [http://www.ubiobio.cl/miweb/webfile/media/222/Tiempo/2008/06%20Paola%20Figueroa%20%20Articulo%20pag%2084-97.pdf «Trapiches i ingenios mineros en la Mendoza colonial - Argentina segles XVI, XVII i XVIII)»(castellà)], ''Tiempo y Espacio,'', any 17, Vol 20, 2008, pàgines 84-97, ISSN 0716-9671&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[drae:trapiche|«trapiche»]] ''Diccionario de la lengua española,'' 22a edició, 2001&lt;/ref&gt; In the seventeenth century, these facilities and the raw material (ore, wages, the lease of the site and water, buildings ...) needed a considerable investment, the major part of it held by wealthy colonial elite.&lt;ref name="prf"/&gt;

Among the general mechanisms by which the Chilean economic life developed in the Colony, the trapiches were a highly profitable investment. On the other hand, the perception of metals as means of payment for its use, offered a source of profitability, as they were connected to the commercial circuit of gold but outside the margins of local production centers.

[[Image:Statyw fotograficzny.jpg|thumb|right|A camera mounted on an aluminum tripod]]
In [[photography]], a '''tripod''' is used to stabilize and elevate a [[camera]], a [[Flash (photography)|flash]] unit, or other photographic equipment. All photographic tripods have three legs and a mounting head to couple with a camera. The mounting head usually includes a [[List of screw drives#Thumbscrew|thumbscrew]] that mates to a female threaded receptacle on the camera, as well as a mechanism to be able to rotate and tilt the camera when it is mounted on the tripod. Tripod legs are usually made to [[telescoping (mechanics)|telescope]], in order to save space when not in use. Tripods are usually made from [[Aluminium|aluminum]], [[carbon fiber]], steel, wood or plastic.

==Usage==
[[Image:Tripod.JPG|thumb|right|Photographers with heavy telephoto lens attachments use a tripod to stabilize their camera to get sharp images]]
Tripods are used for both still and motion photography to prevent camera movement. They are necessary when slow-speed exposures are being made, or when lenses of extreme focal length are used, as any camera movement while the shutter is open will produce a blurred image. In the same vein, they reduce [[camera shake]], and thus are instrumental in achieving maximum [[sharpness (visual)|sharpness]]. A tripod is also helpful in achieving precise framing of the image, or when more than one image is being made of the same scene, for example when bracketing the exposure. Use of a tripod may also allow for a more thoughtful approach to photography. For all of these reasons, a tripod of some sort is often necessary for professional photography as well as certain video uses. Tripods are also used as an alternative to [[C-Stand]]s to photographic accessories.

==Construction==
[[File:Berlebach 402.jpg|thumb|[[Berlebach]] Tripod Report 422 made from wood ([[Fraxinus excelsior |ash]])]]
For maximum strength and stability, most photographic tripods are braced around a center post, with collapsible telescoping legs and a telescoping section at the top that can be raised or lowered. At the top of the tripod is the head, which includes the camera mount (usually a detachable plate with a thumbscrew to hold on to the camera), several joints to allow the camera to pan, rotate and tilt, and usually a handle to allow the operator to do so without jostling the camera. Some tripods also feature integrated remote controls to control a camcorder or camera, though these are usually proprietary to the company that built the camera.  Materials used in the construction of tripod or monopod legs include metal (typically bare or painted aluminum), wood and carbon fiber-reinforced plastics, among others.

===Screw thread===
Per ISO 1222:2010,&lt;ref&gt;http://webstore.ansi.org/FindStandards.aspx?SearchString=ISO+1222%3a2010&amp;SearchOption=0&amp;PageNum=0&amp;SearchTermsArray=null%7cISO+1222%3a2010%7cnull (ISO 1222:2010 "Photography - Tripod connections" )&lt;/ref&gt; the current tripod [[screw thread]] standard for attaching the camera calls for a 1/4-20&amp;nbsp;[[Unified Thread Standard|UNC]]&lt;ref&gt;1/4 inch nominal diameter, 20 threads per inch, [[Unified Thread Standard|Unified National Coarse]] thread profile&lt;/ref&gt; or 3/8-16&amp;nbsp;UNC thread.&lt;ref&gt;3/8 inch nominal diameter, 16 threads per inch, Unified National Coarse thread profile&lt;/ref&gt;  Most consumer cameras are fitted with 1/4-20 UNC threads.  Larger, professional cameras and lenses may be fitted with 3/8-16 UNC threads, plus a removable 1/4-20 UNC adapter, allowing them to be mounted on a tripod using either standard.

Historically, The Royal Photographic Society recommended the thread standard for attaching older cameras to tripods was 3/16-24 [[British Standard Whitworth|BSW]] (3/16 inch nominal diameter, 24 threads per inch), or 1/4-20 [[British Standard Whitworth|BSW]]&lt;ref&gt;1/4 inch nominal diameter, 20 threads per inch, [[British Standard Whitworth]] thread profile&lt;/ref&gt; for smaller cameras and 3/8-16 BSW&lt;ref&gt;3/8 inch nominal diameter, 16 threads per inch, British Standard Whitworth thread profile&lt;/ref&gt; for larger cameras and pan/tilt heads.  In this application, the BSW and UNC thread profiles are similar enough that one can mount a modern camera on a legacy tripod and vice versa. The UNC threads are a 60-degree angle and flattened, whereas the BSW are a 55-degree angle and rounded crest. However, at least one English manufacturer uses No.1 B.A. (British Association) for its tripod mount thread.

==Variations==
[[Image:Tabletop tripod.jpg|thumb|right|A tabletop tripod with a [[ball head]].]]
There are several types of tripods. The least expensive, generally made of aluminum tubing and costing less than US$50, is used primarily for consumer still and video cameras; these generally come with an attached head and rubber feet. The head is very basic, and often not entirely suitable for smooth panning of a [[camcorder]]. A common feature, mostly designed for still cameras, allows the head to flip sideways 90 degrees to allow the camera to take pictures in [[page orientation|portrait]] format rather than [[landscape]]. Often included is a small pin on the front of the mounting screw that is used to stabilize [[camcorder]]s. This is not found on the more expensive photographic tripods.

More expensive professional tripods are sturdier, stronger, and usually come with no integrated head. The separate heads allow a tripod-head combination to be customized to the photographer's needs. There are expensive carbon fiber tripods, used for applications where the tripod needs to be lightweight. Many tripods, even some relatively inexpensive ones, also include leveling indicators for the legs of the tripod and the head.

Many of the more expensive tripods have additional features, such as a reversible center post so that the camera may be mounted between the legs, allowing for shots from low positions, and legs that can open to several different angles.

[[File:Gorillapod-with-camera.jpg|thumb|left|A tripod with flexible legs permitting it to grip to some objects.]]
Small ''tabletop'' tripods (sometimes called ''tablepods'') are also available, ranging from relatively flimsy models costing less than US$20, to professional models that can cost up to US$800 and can support up to 68&amp;nbsp;kg (150&amp;nbsp;lb). They are used in situations where a full sized tripod would be too bulky to carry. An alternative is a ''clamp-pod'', which is a [[ball head]] attached to a [[C-clamp]].

Another technique involves forming a string triangle held taut around the two feet of the photographer and linked to the camera. This ''negative'' string "tripod" can stabilize the camera sufficiently to use a shutter speed three stops slower.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.instructables.com/id/String-Tripod/|title=String Tripod|author=|date=|website=instructables.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Heads===
{{Main|Tripod head}}
The '''head''' is the part of the tripod that attaches to the camera and allows it to be aimed. It may be integrated into the tripod, or a separate part. There are generally two different types of heads available.

[[Image:Manfrotto 488 RC4.jpg|thumb|right|A ball head, showing panoramic rotation lock lever, and ball lock knob.]]
A '''[[ball head]]''' utilizes a [[ball joint]] to allow movement of all axes of [[rotation]] from a single point. Some ball heads also have a separate panoramic rotation axis on the base of the head. The head has two main parts, the ''ball'', which attaches to the camera and the ''socket'', which attaches to the tripod. The camera is attached to the ball via quick release plate, or a simple UNC 1/4"-20 &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gewinde-normen.de/en/camera-mount.html|title=Camera mount Threads|first=Michael Prandl,|last=www.mipraso.de|date=|website=www.gewinde-normen.de}}&lt;/ref&gt; screw. The socket is where the ball rotates in, and also contains the controls for locking the ball. The socket has a slot on the side, to allow the camera to be rotated to the portrait orientation. Ball heads come in varying styles of complexity. Some have only one control for both ball and pan lock. While others have individual controls for the ball, pan, and also ball friction. Ball heads are used when a free-flow movement of the camera is needed. They are also more stable and can hold heavier loads, than pan-tilt heads. However, ball heads have the disadvantage that only one control is available to allow or prevent movement of all axes of rotation, so if the camera is tilted on one axis, there may be a risk of tilting on the other axes as well. When a movement of one, or two axes or rotation is needed, a pan-tilt head is used.

[[Image:Slik pro 700DX.jpg|thumb|left|A 3-way pan-tilt head on a tripod, showing panoramic rotation, lateral tilt, and front tilt controls]]
The '''pan-tilt head''' has separate axes and controls for [[Tilt (camera)|tilting]] and [[Panning (camera)|panning]], so that a certain axis can be controlled without risk of affecting the other axes. These heads come in two types, 2-way and 3-way. 2-way heads have 2 axes and controls, one for panoramic rotation, and one for front tilt. 3-way heads have 3 axes and controls, one for panoramic rotation, front tilt, and lateral tilt.  The controls on these heads are usually [[Handle (grip)|handles]] that can be turned, to loosen or tighten the certain axis. This allows movement in one, a few, or none of the axes. When the movement of all axes of rotation is needed, a ball head is used. There are some pan-tilt heads that use [[gear]]s, for precision control of each axis. This is helpful for some types of photography, such as [[macro photography]].

'''Other head types''' include the gimbal head, fluid head, gear head, [[altazimuth mount|alt-azimuth]], and [[equatorial mount|equatorial]] heads. Fluid heads and gear heads move very smoothly, avoiding the jerkiness caused by the [[stick-slip phenomenon|stick-slip effect]] found in other types of tripod heads. [[Gimbal]] heads are single-axis heads used in order to allow a balanced movement for camera and lenses. This proves useful in wildlife photography as well as in any other case where very long and heavy telephoto lenses are adopted: a gimbal head rotates a lens around its center of gravity, thus allowing for easy and smooth manipulation while tracking moving subjects.

===Monopod===
[[File:Monopod.jpg|thumb|right|Camera and telephoto lens mounted on monopod]]
{{Main|Monopod}}
In place of or to supplement a tripod, some photographers use a one-legged telescoping stand called a [[monopod]] for convenience in setup and breakdown. A monopod requires the photographer to hold the camera in place, but because the monopod reduces the number of [[Degrees of freedom (mechanics)|degrees of freedom]] of the camera, and also because the photographer no longer has to support the full weight of the camera, it can provide some of the same stabilization advantages as a tripod.

{{anchor|hi hat}} {{anchor|low hat}}

==Fixed tripods==
For [[low-angle shot]]s particularly in [[cinematography]], short tripods with fixed length legs and no center column may be used. The lowest of these is called a '''low hat''', with a slightly higher version referred to as a '''hi hat'''.&lt;ref&gt; http://www.filmtools.com/hihats.html retrieved 8 December 2012 &lt;/ref&gt;

==Travel tripods==
A travel tripod is one that has been designed to fit certain criteria including lightness and rigidity to give the photographer the freedom to travel and carry his/her tripod for extended periods. It must be small and light enough to be carried as hand baggage yet has enough strength to support a professional DSLR and fast telephoto lens. Typical specifications for a travel tripod legs would be: Weight (without head): 2 to 4 lbs (0.9 to 1.8&amp;nbsp;kg), Height (contracted): 12 to 20 inches (30 to 50cm), Height (extended): - 60 to 70 inches (152 to 178cm) and Max Load: 5 to 10 lbs (2.3 to 4.6&amp;nbsp;kg).

'''Warehouse Execution Systems''' ('''WES''')&lt;ref&gt;Roberto Michel [http://www.supplychain247.com/article/what_can_warehouse_execution_systems_do_for_your_distribution_center/forte_industries "What Can Warehouse Execution Systems Do For Your Distribution Center Operations"], Supply Chain 247&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;James A. Cooke [http://www.dcvelocity.com/articles/20140310-warehouse-execution-systems-the-answer-for-automated-dcs "Warehouse execution systems: the answer for automated DCs?"]&lt;/ref&gt; are computerized systems used in distribution operations ([[Logistics]]) and are functionally equivalent to a [[manufacturing execution system]] or MES.  Distribution operations are a form of a manufacturing operation that receive, store and track inbound material and then select and combine (assemble) various materials to form a finished product, order, or shipment.

Features of both a WES and MES track and control work process.  WES software [[Organizing (management)|organizes]], sequences and synchronizes work resources necessary to complete the assembly and shipment of finished product.  WES works in real time to enable the control of multiple elements of the production process (e.g. inputs, personnel, machines and support services) where changing conditions in one work process may require changing the directions of upstream or downstream processes (reactive).

The WES is an intermediate step between an [[enterprise resource planning]] (ERP) system, [[warehouse management system]] WMS and the resources necessary to perform the various tasks.  These resources include workers as well as process control systems.  The WES communicates with resources to collect information and direct work effort.

== WES Background ==
WES emerged as a hybrid system that combined specific WMS functionality with [[Warehouse control system|Warehouse Control System (WCS)]] functionality for automated warehouses.  WCS is the software that controls the movement of cases, cartons, totes or pallets on conveyor and sortation systems. In automated warehouses that deploy those types of material handling equipment, WES adds business process logic to the almost real-time WCS data.  Because WES is tightly integrated with automated systems such as conveyors, sortation, pick-to-light, etc., it has near real-time visibility into bottleneck issues.

WES also tends to be more “productized” than WCS – more WMS-type features are fully developed and often come standard.  Vendors typically offer modular software solutions that together form a comprehensive WES.  The modules cover WMS, conveyor control, advanced analytics/reporting, and integration functionalities.  Typical WES packages contain a suite of best practice methods for warehouse operations – e.g. picking and packing – that users can configure based on a workflow. This allows management of a process without customizing the product.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web
| url = http://www.mmh.com/article/wes_solutions_more_than_a_bridge

| last = mmh.com
| website = www.mmh.com
| access-date = 2016-02-29
}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Typical warehouse functionality such as replenishment and order picking take advantage of real-time conditions to optimize productivity. Whereas typical WMS functionality calls for planning and releasing orders to be picked, a WES is focused on executing these tasks based on existing facility conditions.  As a result, warehouses become more flexible and agile in response.

== The Purpose of WES ==
A WES has the ability to span across multiple areas of warehouse functionality that are traditionally managed by a variety of specialized software systems.  WES can be deployed to encompass warehouse management functionality, warehouse control system functionality, material handling equipment (MHE) control, business intelligence and integration with host ERP systems.  Encompassing this broad range of functionality is a distinct advantage for WES.  As a result, the WES can leverage its visibility of lower level warehouse data to quickly adapt functionality needs for current conditions.  This is especially true in facilities with automated systems.  The WES can utilize its WCS roots to access connections to advanced picking and sortation systems thus offering an agile approach to optimizing operations in near real-time.

== WES Business Intelligence Capabilities ==
Another benefit of leveraging the visibility of lower level data across a broad range of warehouse functionality is the ability to provide unprecedented automated [[business intelligence]].  WES’ access to and collection of data from various warehouse points can be utilized to provide not only advanced reporting and live dashboard functionality but business intelligence tools such as predictive analysis, prescriptive analysis, and issue detection.  The WES can feed data into its business [[Intelligence Engine | intelligence engine]] to be mined in near real-time so that DC operations can move beyond just being agile in response to changing conditions, to being proactive in making adjustments before conditions change.  WES data can be analyzed to identify trends and predict operational conditions.  For example, if operation peaks occur at the end of every month, warehouses can use WES feedback to ramp up staffing and equipment needs more efficiently to reduce overall costs.  WES data can also be used to predict issues such as potential stock-outs or order fulfillment delays.  Issue detection can also relate to preventative maintenance of warehouse equipment such as lift trucks, conveyor systems, etc.  To illustrate this point, through analyzing vast amounts of data, the WES can predict when a conveyor motor may need to be replaced or when a lift truck may need servicing to reduce downtime.  By collecting and analyzing data from various lower level warehouse points and taking proactive action, operation leads can use this functionality – which is unique to a WES – to make their facilities more efficient, safe and responsive to increasing customer service requirements.

== Arguments against WES terminology ==
There are a number of voices in the material handling industry that disagree with the creation of a separate term to define WES functionality.

"The new term being used by material handling software providers, integrators, and pretty much anyone associated with the warehousing industry is Warehouse Execution System (WES). According to a March article in DC Velocity, Warehouse Execution Systems can replace both the WMS and WCS by maintaining warehouse inventory records and driving the mechanization. It certainly seems like a very tasty fry sauce!  What’s important to remember when exploring options for a Warehouse Execution System is that the functionality is the same functionality that has always been offered! The key to finding the best system for your facility is not a flashy new name offering a combination or best of both worlds mix of solutions, but rather a modularized solution that allows you to define the functionality required."&lt;ref&gt;Brian Reinhart [https://www.bastiansolutions.com/blog/index.php/2015/06/03/warehouse-execution-systems-new-label-established-solution/#.WP5N_rhRpME "Warehouse Execution Systems: A New Label for an Established Solution"]&lt;/ref&gt;

"Why invent a new term? ... there is no such thing as a WES, WCS, or WMS. (There is) simply Warehouse Software functionality needed to suit a business requirement. If the term WES fits fine, but as soon as you draw too many boundaries you create is another layer of interface and support."&lt;ref&gt;Jay Morris [https://www.linkedin.com/grp/post/8240635-5971006159954464771?trk=groups-post-b-title "Commenting on the Roberto Michel article"]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Counters to the arguments ==
Right or wrong to create a new term, the term WES is being used in the material handling and distribution industry.  The creation of the term arose as a "gap" was identified in the previous divisions of functionality required to operate a distribution facility.  "As the demands of omni-channel distribution continue to pressure facilities and supply chains to run more efficiently, many distributors are realizing that the current functionalities of WMS and WCS are insufficient to align, automate, and synchronize the discrete processes needed to optimally control their order-fulfillment needs."&lt;ref&gt;Reddwerks [http://reddwerks.com/warehouse-execution-software "Why WMS and WCS Aren't Enough"]&lt;/ref&gt;

A common occurrence in a large distribution center is that there are multiple varying types of large equipment and work processes provided by multiple vendors.  The control of these complex and sometimes intricate functions is provided by the equipment supplier that control software is often called [[Warehouse Control System]] or WCS software.  This situation leads to some facilities have multiple WCS software packages running.  Without a WES layer this presents a terminology problem: The operation of all the equipment and process functions need to be coordinated and synchronized to provide the required facility objectives.  This will require either a "Master WCS" or the WMS or ERP system to perform the function.  A WES is the master WCS.

As in a MES [[Manufacturing Execution System]] the line between higher level and lower level control is blurred and not well defined, so it is with a WES.  Manufacturing operations are significantly more mature than distribution when considering lean practices.&lt;ref&gt;[[Lean manufacturing]]&lt;/ref&gt; This is evidenced by the total lack of a Wikipedia article on "Lean distribution".  Manufacturing operations face the same challenges of distribution operations having many different work cells or processes controlled by vendor provided control systems.  A special category of software was created for manufacturing to integrate the overall production and coordinate the efforts of all production resources.

== WES and E-Commerce ==
One of the byproducts of the rise of e-commerce, is the need for software to support the complexities of omni-channel fulfillment. “The omni-channel environment places enormous pressure on DCs to keep up with higher order volumes including rapid processing of small e-commerce orders.”&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The market for WES solutions continue to grow as DC operators seek productivity and support a high throughput.

Emerging functionality such as waveless processing is drawing attention to WES.  Waveless processing requires constantly taking customer orders from a host system and releasing the work to the warehouse floor efficiently.  This is in direct contrast to the typical WMS approach of batching the orders in waves. Waveless processing also allows orders to be worked as received, ensuring a faster turnaround time, and takes advantage of the WES grasp of near real-time information.

Low level machine control software: This software directly interfaces (through I/O) to equipment providing information to and taking directions from higher level systems.  In many operations this functionality is provided by [[Programmable logic controller]] often referred to as PLC logic.  Other operations may use a general purpose computers coupled to industrial Input/Output systems to do the control.

'''Yeasts''' are [[eukaryote|eukaryotic]], [[unicellular organism|single-celled]] [[microorganism]]s classified as members of the [[fungus]] [[kingdom (biology)|kingdom]]. The first yeast originated hundreds of millions of years ago, and 1,500 [[species]] are currently identified.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=7NclBAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA98&amp;dq=S.+cerevisiae+probably+more+than+300+million+years+ago&amp;hl=no&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiepa-I0p7NAhVFMZoKHYIyCnsQ6AEIHTAA#v=onepage&amp;q=S.%20cerevisiae%20probably%20more%20than%20300%20million%20years%20ago&amp;f=false Molecular Mechanisms in Yeast Carbon Metabolism] The second completely sequenced yeast genome came 6 years later from the fission yeast Schizosaccharomyces pombe, which diverged from S. cerevisiae probably more than 300 million years ago&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="YeastRef1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="pmid26447128"&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors=Hoffman CS, Wood V, Fantes PA | title = An Ancient Yeast for Young Geneticists: A Primer on the ''Schizosaccharomyces pombe'' Model System.|journal = [[Genetics (journal)|Genetics]]| volume = 201| issue = 2| pages = 403–23|date=October 2015| pmid = 26447128 | doi = 10.1534/genetics.115.181503 | url = | issn = | pmc=4596657}}&lt;/ref&gt; They are estimated to constitute 1% of all described fungal species.&lt;ref name=Kurtzman2/&gt; Yeasts are unicellular organisms which evolved from multicellular ancestors,&lt;ref name="Yong 2012"/&gt; with some species having the ability to develop [[multicellular organism|multicellular]] characteristics by forming strings of connected budding cells known as [[pseudohyphae]] or false hyphae.&lt;ref name=Kurtzman1/&gt; Yeast sizes vary greatly, depending on species and environment, typically measuring 3–4&amp;nbsp;[[micrometre|µm]] in [[diameter]], although some yeasts can grow to 40&amp;nbsp;µm in size.&lt;ref name=Walker/&gt; Most yeasts reproduce [[asexual reproduction|asexually]] by [[mitosis]], and many do so by the asymmetric division process known as [[budding]].

Yeasts, with their single-celled growth habit, can be contrasted with [[mold]]s, which grow [[hypha]]e. Fungal species that can take both forms (depending on temperature or other conditions) are called [[dimorphic fungi]] ("dimorphic" means "having two forms").

By [[fermentation (food)|fermentation]], the yeast species ''[[Saccharomyces cerevisiae]]'' converts [[carbohydrate]]s to [[carbon dioxide]] and [[ethanol|alcohols]]&amp;nbsp;– for thousands of years the carbon dioxide has been used in [[baking]] and the alcohol in alcoholic beverages.&lt;ref name=Legras2007/&gt; It is also a centrally important [[model organism]] in modern [[cell biology]] research, and is one of the most thoroughly researched [[eukaryotic]] microorganisms. Researchers have used it to gather information about the biology of the eukaryotic cell and ultimately human biology.&lt;ref name="Ostergaard 2000"/&gt; Other species of yeasts, such as ''[[Candida albicans]]'', are [[opportunistic pathogen]]s and can cause [[yeast infection|infections]] in humans. Yeasts have recently been used to generate electricity in [[microbial fuel cell]]s,&lt;ref name="YeastRef3"/&gt; and produce [[ethanol]] for the [[biofuel]] industry.

Yeasts do not form a single [[Taxonomy (biology)|taxonomic]] or [[phylogenetics|phylogenetic]] grouping. The term "yeast" is often taken as a [[synonym]] for ''Saccharomyces cerevisiae'',&lt;ref name=Kurtzman1994/&gt; but the phylogenetic diversity of yeasts is shown by their placement in two separate [[phylum|phyla]]: the [[Ascomycota]] and the [[Basidiomycota]]. The budding yeasts ("true yeasts") are classified in the [[order (biology)|order]] [[Saccharomycetales]],&lt;ref name="YeastRef2"/&gt; within the phylum Ascomycota.

== History ==
{{See also|History of wine|History of beer}}

The word "yeast" comes from [[Old English language|Old English]] ''gist'', ''gyst'', and from the [[Proto Indo-European language|Indo-European]] root ''yes-'', meaning "boil", "foam", or "bubble".&lt;ref name="Bartleby2000"/&gt; Yeast microbes are probably one of the earliest domesticated organisms. Archaeologists digging in Egyptian ruins found early grinding stones and baking chambers for yeast-raised bread, as well as drawings of 4,000-year-old bakeries and breweries.&lt;ref name=NASA/&gt; In 1680, [[Dutch (ethnic group)|Dutch]] naturalist [[Anton van Leeuwenhoek]] first [[microscopy|microscopically]] observed yeast, but at the time did not consider them to be [[organism|living organisms]], but rather globular structures.&lt;ref name=YeastRef11/&gt; Researchers were doubtful whether yeasts were algae or fungi,&lt;ref name="Ainsworth 1976"/&gt; but in 1837 [[Theodor Schwann]] recognized them as fungi.&lt;ref name="Schwann 1837"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Barnett 2004"/&gt;

In 1857, French microbiologist [[Louis Pasteur]] proved in the paper "''Mémoire sur la fermentation alcoolique''" that alcoholic fermentation was conducted by living yeasts and not by a chemical catalyst.&lt;ref name=NASA/&gt;&lt;ref name=Barnett2003/&gt; Pasteur showed that by bubbling oxygen into the yeast broth, [[cell growth]] could be increased, but fermentation was inhibited&amp;nbsp;– an observation later called the "[[Pasteur effect]]".

By the late 18th century, two yeast strains used in brewing had been identified: ''Saccharomyces cerevisiae'' (top-fermenting yeast) and ''[[Saccharomyces carlsbergensis|S.&amp;nbsp;carlsbergensis]]'' (bottom-fermenting yeast). ''S.&amp;nbsp;cerevisiae'' has been sold commercially by the Dutch for bread-making since 1780; while, around 1800, the Germans started producing ''S.&amp;nbsp;cerevisiae'' in the form of cream. In 1825, a method was developed to remove the liquid so the yeast could be prepared as solid blocks.&lt;ref name=Klieger2004/&gt; The industrial production of yeast blocks was enhanced by the introduction of the [[filter press]] in 1867. In 1872, Baron Max de Springer developed a manufacturing process to create granulated yeast, a technique that was used until the first World War.&lt;ref name="urlLe Comité des Fabricants de levure&amp;nbsp;— COFALEC&amp;nbsp;— représente les fabricants"/&gt; In the United States, naturally occurring airborne yeasts were used almost exclusively until commercial yeast was marketed at the [[Centennial Exposition]] in 1876 in Philadelphia, where [[Charles L. Fleischmann]] exhibited the product and a process to use it, as well as serving the resultant baked bread.&lt;ref name=Snodgrass2004/&gt;

== Nutrition and growth ==
Yeasts are [[chemoorganotroph]]s, as they use [[organic compound]]s as a source of energy and do not require sunlight to grow. Carbon is obtained mostly from [[hexose]] sugars, such as [[glucose]] and [[fructose]], or disaccharides such as [[sucrose]] and [[maltose]]. Some species can metabolize [[pentose]] sugars such as ribose,&lt;ref name=Barnett1975/&gt; alcohols, and [[organic acid]]s. Yeast species either require oxygen for aerobic [[cellular respiration]] ([[obligate aerobe]]s) or are anaerobic, but also have aerobic methods of energy production ([[facultative anaerobe]]s). Unlike [[bacteria]], no known yeast species grow only anaerobically ([[obligate anaerobe]]s). Most yeasts grow best in a neutral or slightly acidic pH environment.

Yeasts vary in regard to the temperature range in which they grow best. For example, ''[[Leucosporidium frigidum]]'' grows at {{convert|-2|to|20|C|F}}, ''[[Saccharomyces telluris]]'' at {{convert|5|to|35|C|F}}, and ''[[Candida slooffi]]'' at {{convert|28|to|45|C|F}}.&lt;ref name=Arthur1976/&gt; The cells can survive freezing under certain conditions, with viability decreasing over time.

In general, yeasts are grown in the laboratory on solid [[growth medium|growth media]] or in liquid [[broth]]s. Common media used for the cultivation of yeasts include [[potato dextrose agar]] or [[potato dextrose broth]], Wallerstein Laboratories nutrient [[agar]], yeast [[peptone]] [[dextrose]] agar, and yeast mould agar or broth. Home brewers who cultivate yeast frequently use dried [[malt extract]] and agar as a solid growth medium. The [[antibiotic]] [[cycloheximide]] is sometimes added to yeast growth media to inhibit the growth of ''[[Saccharomyces]]'' yeasts and select for wild/indigenous yeast species. This will change the yeast process.

The appearance of a white, thready yeast, commonly known as kahm yeast, is often a byproduct of the lactofermentation (or pickling) of certain vegetables, usually the result of exposure to air. Although harmless, it can give pickled vegetables a bad flavor and must be removed regularly during fermentation.&lt;ref name=Kaufmann2002/&gt;

== Ecology ==
Yeasts are very common in the environment, and are often isolated from sugar-rich materials. Examples include naturally occurring yeasts on the skins of fruits and berries (such as grapes, apples, or [[peach]]es), and exudates from plants (such as plant saps or cacti). Some yeasts are found in association with soil and insects.&lt;ref name=Suh2005/&gt;&lt;ref name=Slavikova2003/&gt; The ecological function and [[biodiversity]] of yeasts are relatively unknown compared to those of other [[microorganism]]s.&lt;ref name=Herrera2002/&gt; Yeasts, including ''[[Candida albicans]]'', ''[[Rhodotorula]] rubra'', ''[[Torulopsis]]'' and ''[[Trichosporon cutaneum]]'', have been found living in between people's toes as part of their [[skin flora]].&lt;ref name=Oyeka2002/&gt; Yeasts are also present in the [[gut flora]] of mammals and some insects&lt;ref name=Martini1992/&gt; and even deep-sea environments host an array of yeasts.&lt;ref name=Bass2007/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|vauthors=Kutty SN, Philip R | url = http://dyuthi.cusat.ac.in/xmlui/bitstream/handle/purl/2035/Marine%20yeasts-a%20rewiew.pdf| doi = 10.1002/yea.1599 | title = Marine yeasts—a review | journal = Yeast | volume = 25 | issue = 7 | pages = 465–483| year = 2008 | pmid = 18615863}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An Indian study of seven [[honey bee|bee]] species and 9 plant species found 45 species from 16 genera colonise the [[nectaries]] of flowers and honey stomachs of bees. Most were members of the genus ''[[Candida (genus)|Candida]]''; the most common species in honey stomachs was ''[[Dekkera intermedia]]'' and in flower nectaries, ''[[Candida blankii]]''.&lt;ref name=Sandhu1985/&gt; Yeast colonising nectaries of the [[stinking hellebore]] have been found to raise the temperature of the flower, which may aid in attracting pollinators by increasing the evaporation of [[volatile organic compounds]].&lt;ref name=Herrera2002/&gt;&lt;ref name=Barley2010/&gt; A [[black yeast]] has been recorded as a partner in a complex relationship between [[ant]]s, their [[ant-fungus mutualism|mutualistic fungus]], a fungal [[parasite]] of the fungus and a bacterium that kills the parasite. The yeast has a negative effect on the bacteria that normally produce antibiotics to kill the parasite, so may affect the ants' health by allowing the parasite to spread.&lt;ref name=Little2008/&gt;

Certain strains of some species of yeasts produce proteins called yeast killer toxins that allow them to eliminate competing strains. (See main article on [[killer yeast]].) This can cause problems for winemaking but could potentially also be used to advantage by using killer toxin-producing strains to make the wine. Yeast killer toxins may also have medical applications in treating yeast infections (see "Pathogenic yeasts" section below).&lt;ref name="Magliani 2005"/&gt;

Marine yeasts, defined as the yeasts that are isolated from marine environments, are able to grow better on a medium prepared using seawater rather than freshwater (&lt;ref name="auto3"/&gt;). The first marine yeasts were isolated by Bernhard Fischer in 1894 from the Atlantic Ocean, and those were identified as Torula sp. and Mycoderma sp. &lt;ref name="auto2"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Kutty |first1=Sreedevi N. |last2=Philip |first2=Rosamma |title=Marine yeasts—a review |journal=Yeast |date=July 2008 |volume=25 |issue=7 |pages=465–483 |doi=10.1002/yea.1599}}&lt;/ref&gt;. Following this discovery, various other marine yeasts have been isolated from around the world from different sources, including seawater, seaweeds, marine fish and mammals &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Zaky |first1=Abdelrahman Saleh |last2=Greetham |first2=Darren |last3=Louis |first3=Edward J. |last4=Tucker |first4=Greg A. |last5=Du |first5=Chenyu |title=A New Isolation and Evaluation Method for Marine-Derived Yeast spp. with Potential Applications in Industrial Biotechnology |journal=Journal of Microbiology and Biotechnology |date=28 November 2016 |volume=26 |issue=11 |pages=1891–1907 |doi=10.4014/jmb.1605.05074}}&lt;/ref&gt;. Among these isolates, some marine yeasts originated from terrestrial habitats (grouped as facultative marine yeast), which were brought to and survived in marine environments. The other marine yeasts were grouped as obligate or indigenous marine yeasts, which confine to marine habitats &lt;ref name="auto2"/&gt;. However, no sufficient evidence has been found to explain the indispensability of seawater for obligate marine yeasts &lt;ref name="auto3"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Zaky |first1=Abdelrahman Saleh |last2=Tucker |first2=Gregory A. |last3=Daw |first3=Zakaria Yehia |last4=Du |first4=Chenyu |title=Marine yeast isolation and industrial application |journal=FEMS Yeast Research |date=September 2014 |volume=14 |issue=6 |pages=813–825 |doi=10.1111/1567-1364.12158}} [[File:CC-BY icon.svg|50px]] This article contains quotations from this source, which is available under a Creative Commons Attribution license.&lt;/ref&gt;. It has been reported that marine yeasts are able to produce many bioactive substances, such as amino acids, glucans, glutathione, toxins, enzymes, phytase and vitamins with potential application in the food, pharmaceutical, cosmetic and chemical industries as well as for marine culture and environmental protection &lt;ref name="auto3"/&gt;. Marine yeast was successfully used to produce bioethanol using seawater-based media which will potentially reduce the WF of bioethanol &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Zaky |first1=Abdelrahman Saleh |last2=Greetham |first2=Darren |last3=Tucker |first3=Gregory A. |last4=Du |first4=Chenyu |title=The establishment of a marine focused biorefinery for bioethanol production using seawater and a novel marine yeast strain |journal=Scientific Reports |date=14 August 2018 |volume=8 |issue=1 |doi=10.1038/s41598-018-30660-x |url=https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-30660-x |language=En |issn=2045-2322}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

== Reproduction ==
[[File:Yeast lifecycle.svg|thumb|right|250px|The yeast cell's life cycle: {{ordered list |Budding |Conjugation |Spore}}]]
{{See also|Mating of yeast}}

Yeasts, like all fungi, may have [[asexual reproduction|asexual]] and [[sexual reproduction|sexual]] reproductive cycles. The most common mode of vegetative growth in yeast is asexual reproduction by [[budding]].&lt;ref name=Balasubramanian/&gt; Here, a small bud (also known as a [[Bleb (cell biology)|bleb]]), or daughter cell, is formed on the parent cell. The [[cell nucleus|nucleus]] of the parent cell splits into a daughter nucleus and migrates into the daughter cell. The bud continues to grow until it separates from the parent cell, forming a new cell.&lt;ref name=Yeong2005/&gt; The daughter cell produced during the budding process is generally smaller than the mother cell. Some yeasts, including ''[[Schizosaccharomyces pombe]]'', reproduce by [[Fission (biology)|fission]] instead of budding,&lt;ref name=Balasubramanian/&gt; thereby creating two identically sized daughter cells.

In general, under high-stress conditions such as [[nutrient]] starvation, [[haploid]] cells will die; under the same conditions, however, [[diploid]] cells can undergo sporulation, entering sexual reproduction ([[meiosis]]) and producing a variety of haploid [[spore]]s, which can go on to [[mating of yeast|mate]] (conjugate), reforming the diploid.&lt;ref name=Neiman2005/&gt;

The haploid fission yeast ''Schizosaccharomyces pombe'' is a [[facultative]] sexual microorganism that can undergo mating when nutrients are limiting.&lt;ref name="pmid26447128"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Davey 1998"/&gt; Exposure of ''S. pombe'' to hydrogen peroxide, an agent that causes oxidative stress leading to oxidative DNA damage, strongly induces mating and the formation of meiotic spores.&lt;ref name="Bernstein 1989"/&gt; The budding yeast ''Saccharomyces cerevisiae'' reproduces by mitosis as diploid cells when nutrients are abundant, but when starved, this yeast undergoes meiosis to form haploid spores.&lt;ref name="Herskowitz 1988"/&gt; Haploid cells may then reproduce asexually by mitosis. Katz Ezov et al.&lt;ref name="Katz 2010"/&gt; presented evidence that in natural ''S. cerevisiae'' populations clonal reproduction and selfing (in the form of intratetrad mating) predominate. In nature, mating of haploid cells to form diploid cells is most often between members of the same clonal population and [[Outcrossing|out-crossing]] is uncommon.&lt;ref name="Ruderfer 2006"/&gt; Analysis of the ancestry of natural ''S. cerevisiae'' strains led to the conclusion that out-crossing occurs only about once every 50,000 cell divisions.&lt;ref name="Ruderfer 2006"/&gt; These observations suggest that the possible long-term benefits of outcrossing (e.g. generation of diversity) are likely to be insufficient for generally maintaining sex from one generation to the next.&lt;ref name="Bernstein 2013"/&gt; Rather, a short-term benefit, such as recombinational repair during meiosis,&lt;ref name=Birdsell&gt;{{cite book|vauthors=Birdsell JA, Wills C |date=2003 |title=The evolutionary origin and maintenance of sexual recombination: A review of contemporary models |series=Evolutionary Biology Series &gt;&gt; Evolutionary Biology |volume=33 |pages=27–137 |veditors=MacIntyre RJ, Clegg MT |publisher=Springer |isbn=978-0306472619}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Hörandl E |date=2013 |chapter=Meiosis and the Paradox of Sex in Nature |title=Meiosis |isbn=978-953-51-1197-9 |doi=10.5772/56542 |url=http://www.intechopen.com/books/meiosis/meiosis-and-the-paradox-of-sex-in-nature}}&lt;/ref&gt; may be the key to the maintenance of sex in ''S. cerevisiae''.

Some [[Pucciniomycotina|pucciniomycete]] yeasts, in particular species of ''[[Sporidiobolus]]'' and ''[[Sporobolomyces]]'', produce aerially dispersed, asexual [[ballistospore|ballistoconidia]].&lt;ref name=Bai2002/&gt;

== Uses ==
The useful physiological properties of yeast have led to their use in the field of [[biotechnology]]. [[fermentation (biochemistry)|Fermentation]] of sugars by yeast is the oldest and largest application of this technology. Many types of yeasts are used for making many foods: [[baker's yeast]] in bread production, brewer's yeast in [[beer fermentation]], and yeast in wine fermentation and for [[xylitol]] production.&lt;ref name="Chen 2010"/&gt; So-called [[red rice yeast]] is actually a [[mold]], ''[[Monascus purpureus]]''. Yeasts include some of the most widely used [[model organism]]s for [[genetics]] and [[cell biology]].&lt;ref name="Botstein 2011"/&gt;&lt;!--cites previous sentence--&gt;

=== Alcoholic beverages ===
Alcoholic beverages are defined as [[drink|beverages]] that contain [[ethanol]] (C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;OH). This ethanol is almost always produced by [[fermentation (food)|fermentation]]&amp;nbsp;– the [[metabolism]] of [[carbohydrate]]s by certain species of yeasts under anaerobic or low-oxygen conditions. Beverages such as mead, wine, beer, or [[distilled beverage|distilled spirits]] all use yeast at some stage of their production. A distilled beverage is a beverage containing ethanol that has been purified by [[distillation]]. Carbohydrate-containing plant material is fermented by yeast, producing a dilute solution of ethanol in the process. Spirits such as [[whiskey]] and [[rum]] are prepared by distilling these dilute solutions of ethanol. Components other than ethanol are collected in the condensate, including water, [[ester]]s, and other alcohols, which (in addition to that provided by the oak in which it may be aged) account for the [[flavour]] of the beverage.

Brewing yeasts may be classed as "top-cropping" (or "top-fermenting") and "bottom-cropping" (or "bottom-fermenting").&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|vauthors=Priest FG, Stewart GG |date=2006 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=TIYbNdrIsPEC&amp;pg=PA84 |page=84 |publisher=CRC Press |title=Handbook of Brewing}}&lt;/ref&gt; Top-cropping yeasts are so called because they form a foam at the top of the [[wort]] during fermentation. An example of a top-cropping yeast is ''[[Saccharomyces cerevisiae]]'', sometimes called an "ale yeast".&lt;ref name=Gibson2010/&gt; Bottom-cropping yeasts are typically used to produce [[lager]]-type beers, though they can also produce [[ale]]-type beers. These yeasts ferment well at low temperatures. An example of bottom-cropping yeast is ''[[Saccharomyces pastorianus]]'', formerly known as ''S.&amp;nbsp;carlsbergensis''.

Decades ago,{{vague|date=March 2018}} taxonomists reclassified ''S.&amp;nbsp;carlsbergensis'' (uvarum) as a member of ''S.&amp;nbsp;cerevisiae'', noting that the only distinct difference between the two is metabolic. Lager strains of ''S.&amp;nbsp;cerevisiae'' secrete an enzyme called melibiase, allowing them to hydrolyse [[melibiose]], a [[disaccharide]], into more fermentable [[monosaccharide]]s. Top- and bottom-cropping and cold- and warm-fermenting distinctions are largely generalizations used by laypersons to communicate to the general public.&lt;ref&gt;For more on the taxonomical differences, see {{cite book |author=Dowhanick TM |chapter=Yeast&amp;nbsp;– Strains and Handling Techniques |title=The Practical Brewer |editor=McCabe JT |publisher=Master Brewers Association of the Americas |year=1999}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The most common top-cropping brewer's yeast, ''S.&amp;nbsp;cerevisiae'', is the same species as the common baking yeast.&lt;ref name=AmendolaRees2002/&gt; Brewer's yeast is also very rich in [[essential mineral]]s and the [[B vitamin]]s (except B&lt;sub&gt;12&lt;/sub&gt;).&lt;ref name="urlUMMC"/&gt; However, baking and brewing yeasts typically belong to different strains, cultivated to favour different characteristics: baking yeast strains are more aggressive, to carbonate [[dough]] in the shortest amount of time possible; brewing yeast strains act slower but tend to produce fewer off-flavours and tolerate higher alcohol concentrations (with some strains, up to 22%).

''[[Dekkera/Brettanomyces]]'' is a genus of yeast known for its important role in the production of '[[lambic]]' and specialty [[sour ale]]s, along with the secondary conditioning of a particular Belgian [[Trappist beer]].&lt;ref name=Vanderhaegen2003/&gt; The taxonomy of the genus ''Brettanomyces'' has been debated since its early discovery and has seen many reclassifications over the years. Early classification was based on a few species that reproduced asexually (anamorph form) through multipolar budding.&lt;ref name=Custers1940/&gt; Shortly after, the formation of ascospores was observed and the genus ''Dekkera'', which reproduces sexually (teleomorph form), was introduced as part of the taxonomy.&lt;ref name=VanderWalt1984/&gt; The current taxonomy includes five species within the genera of ''Dekkera/Brettanomyces''. Those are the anamorphs ''[[Brettanomyces bruxellensis]]'', ''[[Brettanomyces anomalus]]'', ''[[Brettanomyces custersianus]]'', ''[[Brettanomyces naardenensis]]'', and ''[[Brettanomyces nanus]]'', with teleomorphs existing for the first two species, ''[[Dekkera bruxellensis]]'' and ''[[Dekkera anomala]]''.&lt;ref name=Oelofse2008/&gt; The distinction between ''Dekkera'' and ''Brettanomyces'' is arguable, with Oelofse et al. (2008) citing Loureiro and Malfeito-Ferreira from 2006 when they affirmed that current molecular DNA detection techniques have uncovered no variance between the anamorph and teleomorph states. Over the past decade, ''Brettanomyces'' spp. have seen an increasing use in the craft-brewing sector of the industry, with a handful of breweries having produced beers that were primarily fermented with pure cultures of ''Brettanomyces'' spp. This has occurred out of experimentation, as very little information exists regarding pure culture fermentative capabilities and the aromatic compounds produced by various strains. ''Dekkera''/''Brettanomyces'' spp. have been the subjects of numerous studies conducted over the past century, although a majority of the recent research has focused on enhancing the knowledge of the wine industry. Recent research on eight ''Brettanomyces'' strains available in the brewing industry focused on strain-specific fermentations and identified the major compounds produced during pure culture anaerobic fermentation in wort.&lt;ref name=Yakobson2010/&gt;

==== Wine ====
{{Main|Yeast in winemaking}}

Yeast is used in [[winemaking]], where it converts the sugars present ([[glucose]] and [[fructose]]) in [[grape juice]] ([[must]]) into ethanol. Yeast is normally already present on grape skins. [[Fermentation (wine)|Fermentation]] can be done with this endogenous "wild yeast",&lt;ref name =Ross/&gt; but this procedure gives unpredictable results, which depend upon the exact types of yeast species present. For this reason, a pure yeast culture is usually added to the must; this yeast quickly dominates the fermentation. The wild yeasts are repressed, which ensures a reliable and predictable fermentation.&lt;ref name=Gonzalez/&gt;

Most added wine yeasts are strains of ''S. cerevisiae'', though not all strains of the species are suitable.&lt;ref name=Gonzalez/&gt; Different ''S.&amp;nbsp;cerevisiae'' yeast strains have differing physiological and fermentative properties, therefore the actual strain of yeast selected can have a direct impact on the finished wine.&lt;ref name=Dunn/&gt; Significant research has been undertaken into the development of novel wine yeast strains that produce atypical flavour profiles or increased complexity in wines.&lt;ref name=YeastRef14/&gt;&lt;ref name=McBryde/&gt;

The growth of some yeasts, such as ''[[Zygosaccharomyces]]'' and ''[[Brettanomyces]]'', in wine can result in [[wine fault]]s and subsequent spoilage.&lt;ref name=Loureiro2003/&gt; ''Brettanomyces'' produces an array of [[metabolite]]s when growing in wine, some of which are volatile [[phenol]]ic compounds. Together, these compounds are often referred to as "''Brettanomyces'' character", and are often described as "[[antiseptic]]" or "barnyard" type aromas. ''Brettanomyces'' is a significant contributor to wine faults within the wine industry.&lt;ref name=YeastRef15/&gt;

Researchers from the [[University of British Columbia]], Canada, have found a new strain of yeast that has reduced [[amine]]s. The amines in [[Wine color|red wine]] and [[Chardonnay]] produce off-flavors and cause headaches and hypertension in some people. About 30% of people are sensitive to biogenic amines, such as [[histamine]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title=Eureka!

=== Baking ===
{{refimprove section|date=April 2013}}
{{Main|Baker's yeast}}

Yeast, the most common one being ''S.&amp;nbsp;cerevisiae'', is used in baking as a [[leavening agent]], where it converts the [[fermentation (food)|food]]/fermentable sugars present in dough into the gas [[carbon dioxide]]. This causes the dough to expand or rise as gas forms pockets or bubbles. When the dough is baked, the yeast dies and the air pockets "set", giving the baked product a soft and spongy texture. The use of potatoes, water from potato boiling, [[egg (food)|eggs]], or sugar in a bread dough accelerates the growth of yeasts. Most yeasts used in baking are of the same species common in alcoholic fermentation. In addition, ''Saccharomyces exiguus'' (also known as ''S.&amp;nbsp;minor''), a wild yeast found on plants, fruits, and grains, is occasionally used for baking. In breadmaking, the yeast initially respires aerobically, producing carbon dioxide and water. When the oxygen is depleted, [[fermentation (biochemistry)|fermentation]] begins, producing ethanol as a waste product; however, this evaporates during baking.&lt;ref name="MooreLandecker1996p533-534"/&gt;

[[File:Compressed fresh yeast - 1.jpg|right|thumb|A block of compressed fresh yeast]]

It is not known when yeast was first used to bake bread. The first records that show this use came from [[Ancient Egypt]].&lt;ref name=Legras2007/&gt; Researchers speculate a mixture of flour meal and water was left longer than usual on a warm day and the yeasts that occur in natural contaminants of the [[flour]] caused it to ferment before baking. The resulting bread would have been lighter and tastier than the normal flat, hard cake.

[[File:Dry yeast.jpg|thumb|right|Active dried yeast, a granulated form in which yeast is commercially sold]]

Today, there are several retailers of baker's yeast; one of the earlier developments in North America is [[Fleischmann's Yeast]], in 1868. During World War II, Fleischmann's developed a [[wikt:granulate|granulated]] active dry yeast which did not require refrigeration, had a longer [[shelf life]] than fresh yeast, and rose twice as fast. Baker's yeast is also sold as a fresh yeast compressed into a square "cake". This form perishes quickly, so must be used soon after production. A weak solution of water and sugar can be used to determine whether yeast is expired. In the solution, active yeast will foam and bubble as it ferments the sugar into ethanol and carbon dioxide. Some recipes refer to this as [[Proofing (baking technique)|proofing]] the yeast, as it "proves" (tests) the viability of the yeast before the other ingredients are added. When a [[sourdough]] starter is used, flour and water are added instead of sugar; this is referred to as proofing the [[Sponge and dough|sponge]].{{Citation needed|reason='Reliable sources needed for the whole paragraph, also maybe some irrelevant information for an WP article'|date=October 2016}}

When yeast is used for making bread, it is mixed with [[flour]], salt, and warm water or milk. The dough is [[Kneading|kneaded]] until it is smooth, and then left to rise, sometimes until it has doubled in size. The dough is then shaped into loaves. Some bread doughs are knocked back after one rising and left to rise again (this is called [[proofing (baking technique)|dough proofing]]) and then baked. A longer rising time gives a better flavour, but the yeast can fail to raise the bread in the final stages if it is left for too long initially.

=== Bioremediation ===
Some yeasts can find potential application in the field of [[bioremediation]]. One such yeast, ''[[Yarrowia lipolytica]]'', is known to degrade [[palm oil]] mill [[effluent]], [[Trinitrotoluene|TNT]] (an explosive material), and other [[hydrocarbon]]s, such as [[alkane]]s, [[fatty acid]]s, fats and oils.&lt;ref name="Zinjard 2014"/&gt; It can also tolerate high concentrations of salt and [[heavy metal (chemistry)|heavy metals]],&lt;ref name=Bankar2009rev/&gt; and is being investigated for its potential as a heavy metal [[Biosorption|biosorbent]].&lt;ref name=Bankar2009/&gt; ''Saccharomyces cerevisiae'' has potential to bioremediate toxic pollutants like [[arsenic]] from industrial effluent.&lt;ref name="Soares 2012"/&gt; Bronze statues are known to be degraded by certain species of yeast.&lt;ref name="Cappitelli 2008"/&gt; Different yeasts from Brazilian gold mines [[bioaccumulation|bioaccumulate]] free and [[Coordination complex|complexed]] silver ions.&lt;ref name="Singh 2006"/&gt;

=== Industrial ethanol production ===
{{See also|Biofuel#Bioalcohols|label 1=Bioethanol}}
The ability of yeast to convert sugar into ethanol has been harnessed by the biotechnology industry to produce [[ethanol fuel]]. The process starts by milling a feedstock, such as [[sugar cane]], [[field corn]], or other [[cereal grain]]s, and then adding dilute [[sulfuric acid]], or fungal alpha [[amylase]] enzymes, to break down the starches into complex sugars. A glucoamylase is then added to break the complex sugars down into simple sugars. After this, yeasts are added to convert the simple sugars to ethanol, which is then distilled off to obtain ethanol up to 96% in purity.&lt;ref name="YeastRef4"/&gt;

''Saccharomyces'' yeasts have been [[genetically engineered]] to ferment [[xylose]], one of the major fermentable sugars present in [[Lignocellulosic biomass|cellulosic biomasses]], such as agriculture residues, paper wastes, and wood chips.&lt;ref name=AEM/&gt;&lt;ref name=Ho1998/&gt; Such a development means ethanol can be efficiently produced from more inexpensive feedstocks, making [[cellulosic ethanol]] fuel a more competitively priced alternative to gasoline fuels.&lt;ref name="Madhavan 2012"/&gt;

=== Nonalcoholic beverages ===
[[File:Kombucha jar.jpg|thumb|right|A ''[[kombucha]]'' culture fermenting in a jar]]
[[File:Kombuchacultsm.jpg|thumb|Yeast and bacteria in kombucha at 400×]]
A number of sweet [[soft drink|carbonated beverages]] can be produced by the same methods as beer, except the fermentation is stopped sooner, producing carbon dioxide, but only trace amounts of alcohol, leaving a significant amount of residual sugar in the drink.
* '''[[Root beer]]''', originally made by Native Americans, commercialized in the United States by [[Charles Elmer Hires]] and especially popular during [[Prohibition in the United States|Prohibition]]
* '''[[Kvass]]''', a fermented drink made from [[rye]], popular in Eastern Europe. It has a recognizable, but low alcoholic content.&lt;ref name="Smith 2013"/&gt;
* '''[[Kombucha]]''', a fermented sweetened tea. Yeast in [[symbiosis]] with [[acetic acid bacteria]] is used in its preparation. Species of yeasts found in the tea can vary, and may include: ''[[Brettanomyces bruxellensis]]'', ''[[Candida stellata]]'', ''[[Schizosaccharomyces pombe]]'', ''[[Torulaspora delbrueckii]]'' and ''[[Zygosaccharomyces bailii]]''.&lt;ref name=Teoh2004/&gt; Also popular in Eastern Europe and some [[Post-Soviet states|former Soviet republics]] under the name ''chajnyj grib'' ({{lang-ru|Чайный гриб}}), which means "tea mushroom".
* '''[[Kefir]]''' and '''[[kumis]]''' are made by fermenting milk with yeast and bacteria.&lt;ref name="de Oliveira Leite 2013"/&gt;
* '''[[Mauby]]''' ({{lang-es|mabí}}), made by fermenting sugar with the wild yeasts naturally present on the bark of the ''[[Colubrina elliptica]]'' tree, popular in the [[Caribbean]]

=== Nutritional supplements ===
{{See also|Tibicos}}
{{Advert section|date=October 2016}}
Yeast is used in nutritional supplements, especially those marketed to [[vegan]]s. It is often referred to as "[[nutritional yeast]]" when sold as a dietary supplement. Nutritional yeast is a deactivated yeast, usually ''S. &amp;nbsp;cerevisiae''. It is naturally low in fat and [[sodium]] as well as an excellent source of protein and vitamins, especially most [[Vitamin B|B-complex]] vitamins&lt;ref name="Thaler 2014"/&gt; (contrary to some claims, it contains little or no vitamin B&lt;sub&gt;12&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;ref name="urlUMMC"/&gt; ), as well as other minerals and [[cofactor (biochemistry)|cofactors]] required for growth. Some brands of nutritional yeast, though not all, are fortified with [[Cyanocobalamin|vitamin B&lt;sub&gt;12&lt;/sub&gt;]], which is produced separately by [[bacteria]].&lt;ref name="Duyff 2012"/&gt;

In 1920, the [[Fleischmann's Yeast|Fleischmann Yeast Company]] began to promote yeast cakes in a "Yeast for Health" campaign. They initially emphasized yeast as a source of vitamins, good for skin and digestion. Their later advertising claimed a much broader range of health benefits, and was censured as misleading by the [[Federal Trade Commission]]. The [[fad]] for yeast cakes lasted until the late 1930s.&lt;ref name=Yeast&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Price C|title=The healing power of compressed yeast|journal=Distillations Magazine|date=Fall 2015|volume=1|issue=3|pages=17–23|url=https://www.sciencehistory.org/distillations/magazine/the-healing-power-of-compressed-yeast|accessdate=20 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Nutritional yeast has a nutty, cheesy flavor and is often used as an ingredient in cheese substitutes. Another popular use is as a topping for popcorn. It can also be used in mashed and fried potatoes, as well as in [[scrambled egg]]s. It comes in the form of flakes, or as a yellow powder similar in texture to [[cornmeal]]. In Australia, it is sometimes sold as "savoury yeast flakes". Though "nutritional yeast" usually refers to commercial products, inadequately fed prisoners have used "home-grown" yeast to prevent vitamin deficiency.&lt;ref name="YeastRef8"/&gt;

=== Probiotics ===
Some [[probiotic]] supplements use the yeast ''[[Saccharomyces boulardii|S.&amp;nbsp;boulardii]]'' to maintain and restore the natural flora in the [[gastrointestinal tract]]. ''S.&amp;nbsp;boulardii'' has been shown to reduce the symptoms of acute [[diarrhea]],&lt;ref name="Dinleyici 2012"/&gt; reduce the chance of infection by ''[[Clostridium difficile (bacteria)|Clostridium difficile]]'' (often identified simply as C. difficile or C. diff),&lt;ref name="Johnson 2012"/&gt; reduce bowel movements in diarrhea-predominant [[irritable bowel syndrome|IBS]] patients,&lt;ref name="Dai 2013"/&gt; and reduce the incidence of [[antibiotic-associated diarrhea|antibiotic]]-, [[travelers' diarrhea|traveler's]]-, and [[HIV/AIDS]]-associated diarrheas.&lt;ref name="McFarland 2010"/&gt;

=== Aquarium hobby ===
Yeast is often used by [[aquarium]] hobbyists to generate carbon dioxide (CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) to nourish plants in [[Aquascaping|planted aquaria]].&lt;ref name=Pedersen2007/&gt; CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; levels from yeast are more difficult to regulate than those from pressurized CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; systems. However, the low cost of yeast makes it a widely used alternative.&lt;ref name=Pedersen2007/&gt;

Yeast extract is the common name for various forms of processed yeast products that are used as [[food additive]]s or [[flavour]]s. They are often used in the same way that [[monosodium glutamate]] (MSG) is used and, like MSG, often contain free [[glutamic acid]].&lt;ref&gt;Priest and Stewart (2006), [https://books.google.com/books?id=TIYbNdrIsPEC&amp;pg=PA691 p. 691.]&lt;/ref&gt; The general method for making yeast extract for food products such as [[Vegemite]] and [[Marmite]] on a commercial scale is to add salt to a suspension of yeast, making the solution hypertonic, which leads to the cells' shrivelling up. This triggers [[autolysis (biology)|autolysis]], wherein the yeast's [[digestion|digestive]] enzymes break their own [[protein]]s down into simpler compounds, a process of self-destruction. The dying yeast cells are then heated to complete their breakdown, after which the husks (yeast with thick cell walls that would give poor texture) are separated. Yeast autolysates are used in [[Vegemite]] and [[Promite]] (Australia); [[Marmite]] (the United Kingdom); the unrelated [[Marmite (New Zealand)|Marmite]] (New Zealand); [[Vitam-R]] (Germany); and [[Cenovis]] ([[Switzerland]]).

=== Scientific research ===
[[File:yeast cell english.svg|thumb|right|Diagram showing a yeast cell]]
Several yeasts, in particular ''[[S.&amp;nbsp;cerevisiae]]'' and ''[[S. pombe]]'', have been widely used in genetics and cell biology, largely because they are simple [[eukaryote|eukaryotic]] cells, serving as a model for all eukaryotes, including humans, for the study of fundamental cellular processes such as the [[cell cycle]], [[DNA replication]], [[genetic recombination|recombination]], [[cell division]], and metabolism. Also, yeasts are easily manipulated and cultured in the laboratory, which has allowed for the development of powerful standard techniques, such as [[yeast two-hybrid]],&lt;ref name="Brückner 2009"/&gt; [[synthetic genetic array]] analysis,&lt;ref name="Tong 2006"/&gt; and [[tetrad (genetics)|tetrad analysis]]. Many proteins important in human biology were first discovered by studying their [[homology (biology)|homologues]] in yeast; these proteins include [[cell cycle protein]]s, [[Cell signaling|signaling proteins]], and protein-processing [[enzyme]]s.&lt;ref name="Conn 2007"/&gt;

On 24 April 1996, ''S.&amp;nbsp;cerevisiae'' was announced to be the first eukaryote to have its [[genome]], consisting of 12 million [[base pair]]s, fully sequenced as part of the [[Genome Project]].&lt;ref name=Williams1996/&gt; At the time, it was the most complex organism to have its full genome sequenced, and the work seven years and the involvement of more than 100 laboratories to accomplish.&lt;ref name=accessexcellence/&gt; The second yeast species to have its genome sequenced was ''Schizosaccharomyces pombe'', which was completed in 2002.&lt;ref name=Wood2002/&gt;&lt;ref name=Reinert2002/&gt; It was the sixth eukaryotic genome sequenced and consists of 13.8&amp;nbsp;million base pairs. As of 2014, over 50 yeast species have had their genomes sequenced and published.&lt;ref name="Piskur 2014"/&gt;

Genomic and functional gene annotation of the two major yeast models can be accessed via their respective [[model organism databases]]: [https://www.yeastgenome.org/ SGD]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Cherry |first1=JM |last2=Hong |first2=EL |last3=Amundsen |first3=C |last4=Balakrishnan |first4=R |last5=Binkley |first5=G |last6=Chan |first6=ET |last7=Christie |first7=KR |last8=Costanzo |first8=MC |last9=Dwight |first9=SS |last10=Engel |first10=SR |last11=Fisk |first11=DG |last12=Hirschman |first12=JE |last13=Hitz |first13=BC |last14=Karra |first14=K |last15=Krieger |first15=CJ |last16=Miyasato |first16=SR |last17=Nash |first17=RS |last18=Park |first18=J |last19=Skrzypek |first19=MS |last20=Simison |first20=M |last21=Weng |first21=S |last22=Wong |first22=ED |title=Saccharomyces Genome Database: the genomics resource of budding yeast. |journal=Nucleic Acids Research |date=January 2012 |volume=40 |issue=Database issue |pages=D700-5 |doi=10.1093/nar/gkr1029 |pmid=22110037}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [http://www.pombase.org PomBase].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Lock |first1=A |last2=Rutherford |first2=K |last3=Harris |first3=MA |last4=Hayles |first4=J |last5=Oliver |first5=SG |last6=Bähler |first6=J |last7=Wood |first7=V |title=PomBase 2018: user-driven reimplementation of the fission yeast database provides rapid and intuitive access to diverse, interconnected information. |journal=Nucleic Acids Research |date=13 October 2018 |doi=10.1093/nar/gky961 |pmid=30321395}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Genetically engineered biofactories ===
Various yeast species have been genetically engineered to efficiently produce various drugs, a technique called [[metabolic engineering]]. ''S.&amp;nbsp;cerevisiae'' is easy to genetically engineer; its physiology, metabolism and genetics are well known, and it is amenable for use in harsh industrial conditions. A wide variety of chemical in different classes can be produced by engineered yeast, including [[phenols|phenolics]], [[isoprenoid]]s, [[alkaloid]]s, and [[polyketide]]s.&lt;ref name="Siddiqui 2012"/&gt; About 20% of [[biopharmaceutical]]s are produced in ''S.&amp;nbsp;cerevisiae'', including [[insulin]], [[vaccine]]s for [[hepatitis]], and [[human serum albumin]].&lt;ref name="Nielsen 2012"/&gt;

== Pathogenic yeasts ==

[[File:C albicans en.jpg|thumb|right|250px|A [[photomicrograph]] of ''[[Candida albicans]]'' showing hyphal outgrowth and other morphological characteristics]]

Some species of yeast are [[opportunistic pathogen]]s that can cause infection in people with compromised [[immune system]]s. ''[[Cryptococcus neoformans]]'' and ''[[Cryptococcus gattii]]'' are significant pathogens of [[immunocompromised]] people. They are the species primarily responsible for [[cryptococcosis]], a fungal disease that occurs in about one million [[HIV/AIDS]] patients, causing over 600,000 deaths annually.&lt;ref name="Cogliati 2013"/&gt; The cells of these yeast are surrounded by a rigid [[polysaccharide]] capsule, which helps to prevent them from being recognised and engulfed by [[white blood cell]]s in the human body.&lt;ref name="O'Meara 2012"/&gt;

Yeasts of the genus ''[[Candida (genus)|Candida]]'', another group of opportunistic pathogens, cause [[Oral candidiasis|oral]] and [[vaginal infection]]s in humans, known as [[candidiasis]]. ''Candida'' is commonly found as a [[commensal]] yeast in the [[mucous membrane]]s of humans and other warm-blooded animals. However, sometimes these same strains can become pathogenic. The yeast cells sprout a [[hypha]]l outgrowth, which locally penetrates the [[mucous membrane|mucosal membrane]], causing irritation and shedding of the tissues.&lt;ref name=YeastRef9/&gt; The pathogenic yeasts of candidiasis in probable descending order of [[virulence]] for humans are: ''[[Candida albicans|C.&amp;nbsp;albicans]]'', ''[[Candida tropicalis|C.&amp;nbsp;tropicalis]]'', ''[[Candida stellatoidea|C.&amp;nbsp;stellatoidea]]'', ''[[Candida glabrata|C.&amp;nbsp;glabrata]]'', ''[[Candida krusei|C.&amp;nbsp;krusei]]'', ''[[Candida parapsilosis|C.&amp;nbsp;parapsilosis]]'', ''[[Candida guilliermondii|C.&amp;nbsp;guilliermondii]]'', ''[[Candida viswanathii|C.&amp;nbsp;viswanathii]]'', ''[[Candida lusitaniae|C.&amp;nbsp;lusitaniae]]'', and ''[[Rhodotorula|Rhodotorula mucilaginosa]]''.&lt;ref name=Hurley1987/&gt; ''Candida glabrata'' is the second most common ''Candida'' pathogen after ''C.&amp;nbsp;albicans'', causing infections of the [[urogenital tract]], and of the [[bloodstream]] ([[candidemia]]).&lt;ref name="Brunke 2013"/&gt;

== Food spoilage ==
Yeasts are able to grow in foods with a low pH (5.0 or lower) and in the presence of sugars, organic acids, and other easily metabolized carbon sources.&lt;ref name=Kurtzman3/&gt; During their growth, yeasts metabolize some food components and produce metabolic end products. This causes the physical, chemical, and sensible properties of a food to change, and the food is spoiled.&lt;ref name=Fleet/&gt; The growth of yeast within food products is often seen on their surfaces, as in cheeses or meats, or by the fermentation of sugars in beverages, such as juices, and semiliquid products, such as [[syrup]]s and [[jam]]s.&lt;ref name=Kurtzman3/&gt; The yeast of the genus ''[[Zygosaccharomyces]]'' have had a long history as spoilage yeasts within the [[food industry]]. This is mainly because these species can grow in the presence of high sucrose, ethanol, [[acetic acid]], [[sorbic acid]], [[benzoic acid]], and [[sulphur dioxide]] concentrations,&lt;ref name=Loureiro2003/&gt; representing some of the commonly used [[food preservation]] methods. [[Methylene blue]] is used to test for the presence of live yeast cells.&lt;ref name=Downes2001/&gt; In [[oenology]], the major spoilage yeast is ''[[Brettanomyces bruxellensis]]''.

[[File:Vampir night scope.jpg|thumb|The Zielgerät ZG 1229 Vampir]]
[[File:Vampir night scope tested by British soldier.jpg|thumb|The Zielgerät ZG 1229 Vampir displayed by a British soldier]]

The '''''ZG 1229 Vampir'' 1229''' ('''ZG 1229'''), also known in its code name '''''Vampir''''', was an [[Night vision#Active infrared|active infrared]] device developed for the [[Wehrmacht]] for the [[StG 44|Sturmgewehr 44]] assault rifle during [[World War II]], intended primarily for night use.

==Design==
The ZG 1229 Vampir weighed in at 2.25 kilograms (about 5 lbs.) and was fitted with lugs on the [[StG 44]] at [[C.G. Haenel]] at [[Suhl]], the weapons production facility. The [[grenadier]] carrying this was known as a Nachtjäger (night-hunter). As well as the sight and infrared spotlight, there was a 13.5 kilogram (about 30 lbs.) wooden cased battery for the light, and a second battery fitted inside a gas mask container to power the image converter. This was all strapped to a Tragegestell 39 (pack frame 1939). The searchlight consisted of a conventional tungsten light source shining through a filter permitting only infrared light.  The sensor operated in the upper infrared (light) spectrum rather than in the lower infrared (heat) spectrum and was, therefore, not sensitive to body heat.

==Use==
Vampir gear was first used in combat in February 1945. However, small arms infrared device introduction took place in early 1944. 310 units were delivered to the Wehrmacht at the final stages of the war. [[Eastern Front (World War II)|Eastern Front]] veteran reports consist of snipers shooting at night with the aid of 'peculiar non-shining torches coupled with enormous optical sights' mounted on their rifles. Similar infrared gear was fitted both to [[MG34]] and [[MG42]] machine guns.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.forgottenweapons.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/SdKfz_251_Falke_night_vision-1024x725.jpg&lt;/ref&gt;

==In popular culture==
Much of the plot of [[Stephen Hunter]]'s novel ''The Master Sniper'' revolves around the development and employment of the ''Vampir'' system. It is also referenced in Hunter's book [[Black Light (novel)|''Black Light'']].

One of the weapons in the 2008 videogame ''[[Turning Point: Fall of Liberty]]'' is equipped with a fictional development of the Vampir sight.
