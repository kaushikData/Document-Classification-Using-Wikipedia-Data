      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="15344">'''2014 in sumo''' saw the traditional six major tournaments or ''[[honbasho|basho]]'' held in January, March, May, July, September and November as usual. The ''[[yokozuna]]'' [[Hakuhō]] won five of the six tournaments taking his total of [[yūshō]] to 32 to equal the record of [[Taihō Kōki|Taihō]]. [[Kakuryū]]'s victory in March saw him promoted to become the sport's 71st yokozuna. Consistent performances at the rank of ''[[sekiwake]]'' saw [[Gōeidō]] being promoted to ''[[ōzeki]]'' for the September tournament. The most notable retirement was that of the former ''ōzeki'' [[Kotoōshū]].

==News==

===January===
[[File:Kisenosato vs. Kakuryū 2014 Hatsu basho Tokyo.jpg|thumb|left|Kisenosato faces Kakuryū during the January 2014 tournament.]]
* 3: [[Kazafuzan]], the only wrestler from [[Kazakhstan]] in professional sumo, is arrested for destruction of property after a night of heavy drinking in [[Roppongi]]. His stablemaster [[Mitoizumi Masayuki|Nishikido Oyakata]] apologizes, calling the incident "highly regrettable."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tokyoreporter.com/2014/01/08/sumo-wrestler-arrested-in-roppongi-for-destruction-of-property/|title=Sumo wrestler arrested in Roppongi for destruction of property|date=8 January 2014|publisher=Tokyo Reporter|accessdate=19 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* 10: [[Yokozuna]] [[Harumafuji]] announces he will be absent from the January tournament due to an ankle injury, the first time in over a year he will not appear alongside fellow ''yokozuna'' [[Hakuhō]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.japantimes.co.jp/sports/2014/01/10/sumo/harumafuji-out-of-new-year-basho/#.UyZBBl6gY3g|title=Harumafuji out of New Year Basho; The Japan Times|publisher=japantimes.co.jp|accessdate=2014-03-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* 26: ''Yokozuna'' Hakuhō wins his 28th [[makuuchi]] championship with a playoff victory against [[Kakuryū]], after both men finish with identical 14–1 records.&lt;ref name="japantimes"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.japantimes.co.jp/sports/2014/01/26/sumo/hakuho-beats-kakuryu-in-playoff-to-capture-28th-title/#.UuVLpftjXwc|title=Hakuho beats Kakuryu in playoff to capture 28th title &amp;#124; The Japan Times|publisher=japantimes.co.jp|accessdate=2014-01-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Kisenosato]] pulls out through injury, condemning him to a losing score of 7–8 and leaving his yokozuna promotion bid in tatters. [[Endō Shōta|Endō]] is the only wrestler to win a special prize, the Fighting Spirit Award for his fine 11–4 score. Former [[maegashira]] [[Kimurayama]] and [[Hōchiyama]] both announce their retirements. [[Chiyomaru]] wins his first [[jūryō]] championship, guaranteeing him promotion to the top division. It will mark the first time brothers have been in the same top division tournament since May 2008.

===March===
[[File:Goeido Gotaro in Osaka Naritasan IMG 4469 20140203.JPG|thumb|right|[[Gōeidō]], pictured in his hometown of [[Neyagawa, Osaka|Neyagawa]] in February, was runner-up in March.]]
* 20: former [[Ōzeki]] [[Kotoōshū]] announces his retirement due to injuries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/sports/bulgarian-sumo-wrestler-kotooshu-retires/2014/03/20/7e55ab6c-b006-11e3-b8b3-44b1d1cd4c1f_story.html|title=Bulgarian sumo wrestler Kotooshu retires|date=20 March 2014|publisher=Washington Post|accessdate=20 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was the first European ōzeki and the first European to win a top division championship. He acquires Japanese citizenship and stays in the sumo world as a coach.
* 21: [[Tochinoshin]], after missing three consecutive tournaments due to injury and having fallen to [[makushita]], clinches that division championship with a perfect 7–0 record.
* 23: ''Ōzeki'' Kakuryū takes his first top division championship, with a dominating 14–1 record, virtually guaranteeing his promotion to ''yokozuna''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.japantimes.co.jp/sports/2014/03/24/sumo/yokozuna-council-recommends-kakuryu-for-promotion/#.UzCoCl507P8|title=Yokozuna council recommends Kakuryu for promotion; The Japan Times|publisher=japantimes.co.jp|accessdate=2014-03-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hakuhō, Harumafuji, and [[Sekiwake]] [[Gōeidō Gotarō|Gōeidō]] must settle for runner-up at 12–3. Gōeidō wins his third Outstanding Performance Award. [[Yoshikaze]] guarantees himself promotion to the [[san'yaku]] ranks for the first time after seven years in the top division with his 10–5 score at maegashira 4 and wins his third Fighting Spirit Prize. After missing several tournaments due to injury, including the previous one, [[Hōmashō]] comes back to take the [[jūryō]] championship, losing only on the last day to narrowly miss an exceedingly rare 15–0 championship in ''jūryō''.
* 26: Kakuryu's promotion to yokozuna is confirmed with a unanimous vote by the [[Japan Sumo Association]]. He becomes the 71st yokozuna in sumo, the sixth foreigner, and the third active Mongolian born yokozuna.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.japantimes.co.jp/sports/2014/03/26/sumo/kakuryu-promoted-to-yokozuna/#.U0Fg_vldW_Q|title=Kakuryu promoted to yokozuna|date=26 March 2014|publisher=Japan Times|accessdate=6 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* 30: The annual exhibition tournament at the [[Ise Shrine]] in [[Ise, Mie]] prefecture is held.
* 31: The spring [[Glossary of sumo terms#jungyō|jungyo]] or tour continues at [[Kadoma, Osaka]] prefecture.

===April===
The spring tour visits the following locations:
* 1: [[Kyoto, Kyoto]] prefecture.
* 4: [[Yasukuni shrine]] exhibition tournament, [[Tokyo]].
* 5: [[Fujisawa, Kanagawa]] prefecture.
* 6: [[Fuji, Shizuoka]] prefecture.
* 12: [[Maebashi, Gunma]] prefecture.
* 19: [[Tateyama, Chiba]] prefecture.
* 20: [[Kasama, Ibaraki]] prefecture.
* 26/27: Chokaigi Basho, [[Chiba prefecture]].

===May===
* 25: Hakuhō wins the championship, with a score of 14–1, just ahead of [[Kisenosato]] who returns to form after a poor 2014 thus far and finishes with his 6th career runner-up performance. Kakuryū can only manage a very disappointing 9–6, losing his last three matches. The two ''komusubi'' debutantes [[Yoshikaze]] and [[Chiyoōtori]] unsurprisingly finish with losing scores, but [[Gōeidō]] holds his ''sekiwake'' rank for a 13th consecutive basho and wins his 4th Outstanding Performance prize for his defeat of Hakuhō, just about keeping his ''ōzeki'' promotion hopes alive. [[Sadanoumi Takashi|Sadanoumi]] wins the Fighting Spirit prize in his makuuchi debut, emulating [[Sadanoumi Kōji|his father]] who did the same nearly 34 years ago in November 1980. In the ''jūryō'' division, former collegiate champion [[Ichinojō]] wins the championship at his first attempt. In ''makushita'', former ''maegashira'' [[Kimikaze]] calls time on his injury-blighted career at the age of 27. [[Georgian people|Georgian]] former ''komusubi'' [[Tochinoshin]] wins his second consecutive ''makushita'' championship with a perfect 7–0 record,  continuing his strong comeback from injury. Joining him in ''juryo'' next tournament will be [[Kyokutaisei]], who becomes the first ''[[sekitori]]'' from [[Hokkaido]] since [[Wakatenro]] in 2011.

===July===
[[File:Kotoshogiku in Harubasho 2013 IMG 1887-2 20130324.JPG|thumb|left|[[Kotoshōgiku]] was runner-up for the first time as an ''ōzeki'' in July.]]{{-}}
* 27: The tournament in Nagoya has an exciting conclusion, with Hakuhō, Gōeidō and [[Kotoshōgiku]] all in contention for the [[Emperor's Cup]] going into the final day. Gōeidō defeats Kotoshōgiku (sealing his own promotion to ''ōzeki'' in the process), but Hakuhō avoids a three way playoff by beating [[Harumafuji]]i to win outright with a score of 13–2. Gōeidō had also defeated two ''yokozuna'' on consecutive days and naturally is awarded his third consecutive Outstanding Performance Prize. [[Takayasu Akira|Takayasu]] takes the Fighting Spirit Prize. Tochinoshin defeats Ichinojō in a playoff to win the ''jūryō'' division championship. Former ''maegashira'' [[Takanoyama]], a crowd-pleaser and one of the lightest top division wrestlers ever, announces his retirement.
* 30: Gōeidō's promotion to ''ōzeki'' is confirmed, ending his record run of 14 consecutive tournaments at ''sekiwake''.&lt;ref name="ozeki"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.japantimes.co.jp/sports/2014/07/30/sumo/goeido-promoted-to-ozeki-for-september-basho/#.VKhnLyvF9Fw|title=Goeido promoted to ''ozeki'' for September basho|date=30 July 2014|publisher=[[Japan Times]]|accessdate=3 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; He has 32 wins over the last three tournaments, and becomes the third active Japanese ''ōzeki'', on the ''[[banzuke]]'' beneath the three Mongolian ''yokozuna''.

===August===
The summer tour visits the following locations:
* 8: [[Ishioka]] and [[Omitama]], [[Ibaraki prefecture]]
* 9: [[Niigata, Niigata]]
* 10: [[Nagai, Yamagata]]
* 11: [[Kami, Miyagi]]
* 12: [[Akita, Akita]]
* 15: [[Chitose, Hokkaido]]
* 16: [[Sapporo, Hokkaido]]
* 17: [[Kushiro, Hokkaido]]

===September===
* 18: It is a tournament to forget for Harumafuji. A day after the indignity of being disqualified for hair-pulling for the second time this year (previously the only yokozuna to suffer this fate was [[Asashōryū]] in 2003), it is announced that he is withdrawing because of an eye injury he sustained in the match.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ajw.asahi.com/article/behind_news/sports/AJ201409180091|title=SUMO/ Harumafuji pulls out, Hakuhō shares lead on Day 5|date=18 September 2014|publisher=Asahi Shimbun|accessdate=3 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Others to miss the tournament through injury include ''sekiwake'' [[Myōgiryū]] and maegashira [[Hōmashō]] and [[Azumaryū]].
* 27: The bout of the tournament is fought between Hakuhō and newcomer Ichinojō, both of whom have twelve wins and just one loss. Ichinojō, who is bidding to become the first ''makuuchi'' debutant to win the championship since [[Ryōgoku Kajinosuke II|Ryōgoku]] in 1914, had beaten two ''ōzeki'' and a ''yokozuna'' in the previous three days but could not overcome Hakuhō, who moves to within one win of his 31st championship.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ajw.asahi.com/article/behind_news/sports/AJ201409270048|title=SUMO/ Hakuho moves closer to 31st title by defeating Ichinojo on Day 14|date=27 September 2014|publisher=Asahi Shimbun|accessdate=3 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* 28: After tying the great Chiyonofuji's record of 31 top division championship, Hakuhō says, "I watched him when I was young and always aspired to be a wrestler like him so I am very happy."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ajw.asahi.com/article/behind_news/sports/AJ201409280025|title=SUMO/ Hakuho wins autumn tourney to move into tie for 2nd on all-time list on Day 15|date=28 September 2014|publisher=Asahi Shimbun|accessdate=3 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ichinojō wins his last bout to finish with an outstanding 13–2 record and wins prizes for Fighting Spirit and Outstanding Performance. The Technique Award goes to veteran [[Aminishiki]] for the sixth time. Tochinoshin celebrates his return to the top division in style by winning the ''jūryō'' championship with a perfect 15–0 score, only the third wrestler in the modern six tournaments a year era after [[Kitanofuji]] and [[Baruto]] to achieve this. It is his fourth straight championship, two in ''makushita'' and two in ''jūryō''. Former ''komusubi'' [[Wakakōyū]] retires.

===November===
[[File:Kyokutenho 2008.jpg|thumb|right|[[Kyokutenho]] won a [[sansho (sumo)|special prize]] at the age of 40 in November.]]
* 23: An historic day sees Hakuhō equal Taihō's record of 32 tournament titles, set in 1971, by defeating Kakuryū to finish two wins clear of his nearest rival at 14–1. Hakuhō was inspired by the legendary ''Yokozuna'' Taihō, who had links to his [[Miyagino stable]] and occasionally attended training sessions there. Hakuhō had visited Taihō just two days before his death in January 2013 and told him he would try to break his record.&lt;ref name="promise"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ajw.asahi.com/article/behind_news/sports/AJ201411240022 |title=SUMO/ Promise made to fabled Taihō drove Hakuhō to record-tying 32nd championship |date=24 November 2014 |publisher=Asahi Shimbun |accessdate=3 January 2015 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150104014216/http://ajw.asahi.com/article/behind_news/sports/AJ201411240022 |archivedate=4 January 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Hakuhō's only defeat is to Takayasu, who scores an impressive 10–5 and wins the Outstanding Performance Award. Both ''sekiwake'', [[Aoiyama]] and Ichinojō, were making their debuts at the rank and both come through with winning records, the first time this has happened in seven years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ajw.asahi.com/article/behind_news/sports/AJ201411230027|title=SUMO/ Hakuhō claims 32nd championship, ties immortal Taiho on Day 15|date=23 November 2014|publisher=Asahi Shimbun|accessdate=3 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The seemingly indestructible [[Kyokutenhō]], in his 1410th ''makuuchi'' bout, forces out [[Chiyomaru]] to claim his tenth win of the tournament and his seventh Fighting Spirit prize at the age of 40 years, two months.

'''Abdullah Jaber'''  (born 17 February 1993) is a Palestinian professional [[association football|footballer]] who plays as a [[Defender (association football)|left back]] for [[Ahli Al-Khaleel]] of the [[West Bank Premier League]] and for the [[Palestine national football team]]. He is the youngest Palestinian footballer to amass 35 [[international caps]] having started 35 of Palestine's last 40 games between May 2014 and August 2018.

==Club career==
===Move to West Bank Premier League===

Jaber made his professional debut in Israel's top tier with [[Ironi Ramat HaSharon]] in the 2011/12 season playing 23 minutes as a substitute. He was part of the team that finished sixth (the club's best ever finish) in the league the following season.

After not being given his chance at Ramat HaSharon, Jaber made the decision to move to the Palestinian league signing with [[Hilal Al-Quds]] of the [[West Bank Premier League]] in 2013/14. Jaber proved to be an immediate hit, walking directly into the starting lineup. He won the [[2013–14 Palestine Cup|Palestine Cup that season]] with Hilal at the end of his first season.

Jaber made his [[AFC Cup]] debut with Hilal Al-Quds in 2015 and helped keep a clean sheet in playoff qualifier vs eventual quarterfinalists [[El-Jeish]] of Syria (0–0, Hilal lost on penalties).

At the beginning of the 2015/16 season, Jaber elected to sign with [[Ahli Al-Khalil]]. After winning the Palestine Super Cup against Shabab Al-Dhahrieh and the Palestine Cup against Ittihad Shujaiyah, he helped qualify the team for the group stage, playing all 90 minutes 1–0 win vs. [[Khujand]] (Tajikistan).

===Move to Egyptian Premier League===

In August 2016, Abdallah Jaber agreed a three-year deal with [[El-Mokawloon SC]] of the Egyptian Premier League. His contract was voided three days later. The following year, Jaber signed for Alexandria based [[Al Ittihad Alexandria Club|Al-Ittihad]] but the deal was voided again with the club revealing that the player's Israeli had passport scuppered his registration with the [[Egyptian Football Association]].

==International career==

Abdullah Jaber earned his first cap, aged 21, in the [[2014 AFC Challenge Cup]] opening game when Palestine faced [[Kyrgyzstan national football team|Kyrgyzstan]]. Despite his inexperience he helped Palestine keep a clean sheet in a game they won 1–0. He played 360 of the 450 minutes of the tournament helping Palestine lift the title without conceding a goal en route to their first [[AFC Asian Cup]] appearance.

His first international goal came in his 8th cap in a 2–0 friendly win vs. [[Pakistan national football team|Pakistan]]. He scored his second goal in October 2017, in a [[2019 AFC Asian Cup qualification]] match against Bhutan.

At the [[2015 AFC Asian Cup]] he was one of only two Palestine players to start and play every single minute of the tournament. His performances were widely regarded as one of the few highlights of an otherwise dour campaign that saw Palestine lose all three games.

Jaber remains a crucial player for Palestine, having started and played every single minute of the side's [[2018 FIFA World Cup qualification (AFC)|2018 FIFA World Cup qualification]].

'''Albion Cricket Club''' is a cricket club based in [[Dunedin]], New Zealand.  

Founded in 1862, it is reputedly the oldest continuously existing club in either New Zealand or Australia.&lt;ref name="Macpherson"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.espncricinfo.com/magazine/content/story/754691.html|title=Albion CC  The club that produced 25 New Zealand internationals|last=Macpherson|first=Will|date=June 24, 2014|work=Cricinfo Magazine|publisher=ESPN Cricinfo|accessdate=26 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

In 2013, Albion stalwart Warwick Larkins, convener of the 150th celebrations, enquired in Sydney, Melbourne and Adelaide and found:{{quote|text=[[Melbourne Cricket Club]] [founded in 1838] is older than us, but no-one knew whether they had been continuous or not.|sign=Warwick Larkins|source=&lt;ref name="150th"/&gt;}}

The club's home ground is at Culling Park in [[Musselburgh, New Zealand|Musselburgh]].

== List of internationals ==
Albion's roll of honour contains the names of many '''current''' and former international players, among them the following:&lt;ref name="Macpherson"/&gt;

Further to this the club boasts several more first class players.

One of the many quirks about Albion is the fact it was home to a group of 5 players to have scored first class triple centuries.

The '''''Alpine Club Guides''''' ({{lang-de|Alpenvereinsführer}}, commonly shortened to '''''AV Führer''''' or '''''AVF''''') are the standard series of Alpine guides that cover all the important mountain groups in the [[Eastern Alps]]. They are produced jointly by the [[German Alpine Club|German]] (DAV), [[Austrian Alpine Club|Austrian]] (ÖAV) and [[South Tyrol Alpine Club]]s (AVS). They have been published since 1950 by the firm of [[Bergverlag Rother]] in Munich, Germany.

The AV guides contain all the routes – hiking trails, mountain hut approaches and summit climbs as well as ice and high mountain routes and ''[[klettersteig]]s'' in each mountain range. The descriptions are factual and dry, with few illustrations - rather unlike mountain books by e.g. Walter Pause – and despite introductory sections require general Alpine knowledge and experience. Examples are the ''AVF [[Allgäuer Alpen]]'' and the ''AVF [[Verwallgruppe]]''.The AV guides are often used as the basis for other publications and complement the [[Alpine Club map]]s  or other map series.

== SAC Clubführer ==
Die '''Alpinführer''' (bzw. '''Clubführer''') des [[Schweizer Alpen-Club]] (SAC) sind das Pendant der AV-Führer für das Gebiet der Schweizer [[Westalpen]]. Die SAC-Führer beschreiben ebenfalls alle Gipfel, Wege und Anstiegsrouten eines Gebietes. Ähnlich zu den Alpenvereinsführern sind auch hiervon regelmäßig mehrere Bände vergriffen und auch das Erscheinungsbild mutet nicht mehr ganz zeitgemäß an. Das tut jedoch der inhaltlichen Qualität keinen Abbruch.

{{1936 Summer Olympics}}
'''''Berlin 36''''' is a 2009 German film telling the fate of Jewish [[track and field]] athlete [[Gretel Bergmann]] in the [[1936 Summer Olympics]]. She was replaced by the [[Nazi]] regime by an athlete later discovered to be an intersex man. The film, based on a true story,  was released in Germany on September 10, 2009.

Reporters at ''[[Der Spiegel]]'' challenged the historical basis for many of the events in the film,  pointing to arrest records and medical examinations indicating German authorities did not learn [[Dora Ratjen]] was male until 1938.&lt;ref name=spiegel&gt;{{cite news

== Plot ==
The athlete Gretel Bergmann wins the [[high jump]] championships in the United Kingdom. For the Nazi racial laws prevented her continuing her training in Germany, being a Jew, her father had sent her to England, where she could live more safely and continue her sporting career.

At the Berlin Olympics in 1936, the Americans and the [[IOC]] (International Olympic Committee) demand that Jewish athletes are not to be excluded from the event, especially the high jumper Gretel Bergmann of international fame, thus putting the Nazi Olympic Committee in great difficulty. A victory by a Jewish athlete would seriously humiliate the [[Nazi party]]. When her family in Germany is threatened, Gretel returns to Germany. She is included in the German Olympic high jump team, seemingly with the same rights as the other athletes in the training camp.

Hans Waldmann, the coach of the team, is enthusiastic about the skills and discipline of Gretel and adopts a policy of impartiality based solely on sportsmanship. However, Waldmann is dismissed by Nazi party officials and replaced as coach by Sigfrid Kulmbach, loyal to the party. Kulmbach attempts, instead, by every means to discourage the young athlete and undermine her self-esteem.

Her roommate and sole competitor in talent is Marie Ketteler. Marie, however, is really a man, by whom the Nazis want to attain the [[gold medal]] in high jump. Between Marie and Gretel,  despite numerous threats from outside, a friendship forms.

Despite being the most promising athlete in high jump training, Gretel is suddenly excluded from competition under false pretences, only a few days before the Games. She is replaced by Marie, the second best athlete.

Marie, however, behaves in strange ways: she never takes a bath with her companions, shaves her legs several times a day and has a deep voice. Gretel, therefore, discovers her true identity. Meanwhile, Marie discovers that Gretel was excluded from the race under false pretenses. So Marie decides to deliberately lose the final and decisive leap. The dislodged bar spells the shattering of hope of victory in the German officials, who are dumbstruck. Marie gains only the fourth place. Marie and Gretel, the latter observing the contest as a spectator, exchange a secret happy smile, for their common opposition led to the defeat of the cruel Nazi ambitions and ideals.

== Premiere ==
Berlin 36 premiered on August 22, 2009 in the German capital, Berlin. The film received a critics generally positive. The film has been called "interesting" by the German magazine ''[[Der Spiegel]]'' and placed in the category "play" with the German weekly ''[[Die Zeit]]''.

In January 2010, the film was presented in the ''Palm Springs International Film Festival''. On the same date, the film was presented in the ''Atlanta Jewish Film Festival'' and the ''New York Jewish Film Festival'', a film festival that engages with Jewish history.

During the presentation of the movie in the ''Atlanta Jewish Film Festival'', the consular officer Lutz Görgens compared the theme of the movie to [[Jeremy Schaap]]'s book ''Triumph'', which tells the story of the American athlete [[Jesse Owens]], who won the gold medal in the 1936 Olympic Games, despite the strong discrimination he suffered. Görgens said that "the book and the movie teaches us about the bad politics of sport. They remind us of the preciousness of political freedom, the excellence of athletic futility, and the true value of friendship".

In fact, unlike the film, Gretel Bergmann, as a young woman did not know her partner was really a man, but she learned it only in 1966, reading an article in ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]''. Bergmann told the magazine ''Der Spiegel'', at the age of 95 years, "I never suspected anything. We all wondered why she never got naked in the shower. Being so shy at seventeen, it seemed absurd, but we thought, well, it is bizarre and weird".

==Island Leagues including the two zones of Santiago and Santo Antão==
{{Unreferenced section|date=July 2010}}
Unlike other leagues throughout the world in which is the second, third and fourth, the lowest is mainly the second division or secondary leagues and are split into ten leagues of which are played in the nine  main islands, Santiago and Santo Antão is split into two, the North Zone and the South Zone; the tenth main island of [[Santa Luzia, Cape Verde|Santa Luzia]] is uninhabited. The team of each league with the most points qualifies and advances into the premier division. One of these examples includes these islands and zones.

'''Club Universidad de Chile''' ({{IPA-es|kluβ uniβeɾsiˈðað ðe ˈtʃile}}) is a professional [[Association football|football]] club based in [[Santiago]], Chile, that plays in the [[Chilean Primera División|Primera División]].

The club was founded on May 24, 1927. Universidad de Chile is one of the most successful and popular football clubs in Chile, having won the league title 18 times.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|last=Juan Pablo Andrés and Eric Boesenberg |url=http://www.rsssf.com/tablesc/chilechamp.html |title=Chile&amp;nbsp;– List of Champions and Runners Up |edition=Rec.Sport.Football Statistics Foundation (RSSSF) |accessdate=2009-10-23 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100113113439/http://rsssf.com/tablesc/chilechamp.html |archivedate=2010-01-13 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; In the last 10 years, the team has been crowned champion six times, including their undefeated run to the [[2011 Copa Sudamericana]] title.
The team has been throughout its history associated with the blue colour, also present on the logo, which was officially adopted in 1943. The club rivalries are with [[Colo-Colo]] and [[Club Deportivo Universidad Católica|Universidad Católica]], with whom they regularly contest the Santiago derbies known as ''Clásicos''.

Despite not owning its stadium, the club usually plays its home games at the [[Estadio Nacional Julio Martínez Prádanos]], in the commune of [[Ñuñoa]] in Santiago. The Estadio Nacional's modernization process, forced the team to play home games in various stadiums across Chile in 2010. Universidad de Chile made a return to the Estadio Nacional on August 2010 against [[C.D. Guadalajara|Guadalajara]] of [[Mexico]] during the [[2010 Copa Libertadores]] semi-finals.

Universidad de Chile was the champion of the [[Copa Sudamericana]] 2011 (the first international title of its history). In this tournament, the club had an excellent performance: wasn't defeated, won all their matches in Chile and had the top scorer of the tournament's history ([[Eduardo Vargas]]). Universidad de Chile has reached semi-finals in the [[Copa Libertadores]] four times (years 1970, 1996, 2010 and 2012).

==History==
The club was founded on May 24, 1927,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | title = Chile's university challenge | publisher = FIFA | date = 29 October 2009 | accessdate = 10 May 2018 | url = https://www.fifa.com/news/y=2009/m=10/news=chile-university-challenge-1125459.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; as ''Club Deportivo Universitario'' by the merger of ''Club Náutico'' and ''Federación Universitaria''. Initially, the club was formed by students of the [[Universidad de Chile]] and was the sport brand of the university until 1980 when the university's rector and president of the club at the time (both of them appointed by the [[Augusto Pinochet|Pinochet]] dictatorship) decided to separate the club from the university and created the CORFUCH to manage the football team. This move was a part of the [[Universidad de Chile (university)#Major Reforms during Military Regime of 1973-1989|atomization]] of the Universidad de Chile made by the military dictatorship in order to strengthen the private universities that were founded during that time and also to reduce state power. This was seen as a major blow to the club, as it was left with nothing but a loyal fan base. From then on, the club started to decline in terms of results on the field and lack of support from various sectors of the economy when other major clubs in Chile were helped by main powers such as the government, the [[Roman Catholicism in Chile|catholic church]], and [[Codelco]]. Eventually, the team's poor performances led to a relegation to [[Liga Chilena de Fútbol: Primera B|second division]] in 1988, and threats to dissolve the club were made by the university if the team did not manage to return to the first division within a year. In 1989, Universidad de Chile were able to earn the 2nd division's championship, thus bringing them back to the first division, where they have remained since then.

===Bankruptcy and Azul Azul===
In 2006, the club declared [[bankruptcy]] and received an imposed administration that was criticized by the supporters, as the new chairman immediately fired club symbols and tried to transform the club into a private company of public stocks, being opposed to the decision of the club members in a previous assembly.{{citation needed|date=June 2016}} The team finished the year with the worst campaign in the club history and the almost-sure transformation into private company due to the ties between the appointed chairman and several businessmen.

During 2007, the imposed administration gave the club into concession to a private group (Azul Azul). In 2008, the new university's rector agreed to enter a contract with the now private club, in which he allowed the use of the university's name and symbols in exchange for a [[Royalties|royalty]] and the right to appoint two out of the eleven directors of the board.{{citation needed|date=June 2016}}

==Colours and logo==

===Home kit and away kit===
The team's home kit from 1943 to 1958 consisted of a blue jersey, a white short and blue socks. In 1959, the home kit was changed to an all royal blue kit. In 1992 a darker tone of blue was used for the home kit and in 1996 a red stripe was added to the sleeves. The team's home kit saw its most drastic change in 2001–02 when red sleeves were included on the jersey; this kit retained the blue shorts and blue socks. In 2006, the team returned to the 1959 variation of its uniform and has not changed it since then. The current home kit features the classic red letter U on the front of the jersey.

From 1934 until 2001–02, Universidad de Chile's away kit consisted of a  white jersey, shorts and socks, occasionally using blue shorts during the 1990s. In 2001–02, for the first time in the club's history a red kit was introduced; this kit consisted of a red jersey with dark blue sleeves, red shorts and red socks. In 2005, the club introduced a new all-red away kit, thereby dropping the blue sleeves in favor of red ones. The current away kit in a similar fashion to the home kit also features the red letter U on the front of the jersey.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |last=Switch |first=Image |url=http://www.switchimageproject.com/2009/10/universidad-de-chile-200910-team-kits.html |archive-url=https://archive.is/20120918033006/http://www.switchimageproject.com/2009/10/universidad-de-chile-200910-team-kits.html |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2012-09-18 |title=Universidad de Chile 2009/10 team kits |date=2009-10-17 |accessdate=2009-10-19 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Universidad de Chile wore a kit that featured the regular royal blue jersey, white shorts and royal blue socks for a game against Chivas during the 2010 Copa Libertadores. At the end of 2010 the historical all-white combination made a return as the club's alternate kit.

===The chuncho logo===
The team's logo, a red and white chuncho ([[Austral pygmy owl]]), has its origins in the days of the Club Náutico Universitario which gave its emblem to the Club Universitario de Deportes (CUD), when was founded in 1927. The logo was taken from Germany by Pablo Ramírez Rodríguez, who turned into a Minister of Exchequer in 1945. The chuncho was chosen for its association with wisdom, mutual knowledge, harmony of the body and soul.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Scaff|first1=Patricio|title=Sports' origin in Universidad de Chile and the "chuncho" in the club's history|url=http://www.uchile.cl/acerca/aprofesionales/boletin/boletin8/04.html|publisher=Universidad de Chile|accessdate=4 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The team's logo is not usually found on the team's uniform, being favored in turn by a red letter U with a white trim. The chuncho logo was absent from the team's jersey starting in 1979, but made a return during the 1996–97 season. Since 2006–07, a small chuncho logo could be found on the jersey along with the red U.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Romántico Viajero|title=Camisetas años 2000|url=http://www.romanticoviajero.cl/HTML/camisetas2009.html|website=Romántico Viajero|accessdate=4 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Achievements==
Universidad de Chile's first title was won in 1940, just 3 years after their professional debut. The team won six titles (1959, 1962, 1964, 1965, 1967, 1969) between 1959 and 1969 and the became known as the [[Ballet Azul|''Blue Ballet'']] in reference the beautiful style of football they played. Nine members of that squad were part of the Chilean national team that reached 3rd place in the [[1962 FIFA World Cup]], the best result ever achieved by Chile in a World Cup.

In 1995, Universidad de Chile won the cup once more, this time at home in front of almost 78,000 people in the [[Estadio Nacional (Chile)|Estadio Nacional]]. The team would then win back-to-back titles in 1999 and 2000.

More recently Universidad de Chile has won the [[Apertura]] in 2004, 2009, 2011 and 2014/2015, and Clausura in 2011 and 2016/2017. The 2011, the title was won at the hands of defending champions Universidad Católica, by a global score of 4–3, having lost the first leg of the final 2–0 and needing to win by a 3-goal margin, the team managed to win the second leg by a 4–1 score.

On the international stage Universidad de Chile have had a few of good runs in [[Copa Libertadores]], reaching the semi-finals in [[1970 Copa Libertadores|1970]], [[1996 Copa Libertadores|1996]], [[2010 Copa Libertadores|2010]], and [[2012 Copa Libertadores|2012]].

On December 14, 2011 they defeated Liga De Quito from Ecuador 3–0 (4–0 on aggregate) to win the [[Copa Sudamericana]], becoming the third Chilean team to win a South American tournament, behind [[Colo-Colo]]'s 1991 [[Copa Libertadores]] and [[Club Deportivo Universidad Católica|Universidad Catolica]]'s 1994 [[Copa Interamericana]]. In the tournament, the club had an excellent performance (undefeated, and winning all their matches in Chile), and was nicknamed the "South America's [[FC Barcelona]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news| last = Francis Fields |url = http://footballanchor.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=3177:brazilian-media-praise-visiting-universidad-de-chile-as-qsouth-americas-barcelona-teamq&amp;catid=57:latest-news&amp;Itemid=168 |title= Brazilian media praise visiting Universidad de Chile as "South America's Barcelona team" | edition = Footballanchor | accessdate =2011-11-23}}{{dead link|date=June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''DKR Engineering''' is a racing team and preparation firm from [[Luxembourg]], which competed in the [[FIA GT1 World Championship]].  The company was founded in 2004 by Kendy Janclaes as a branch of the PSI Experience racing team from Belgium.  After running PSI's racing programs, DKR began their own programs in 2008, running in the [[FFSA GT Championship]] with [[Chevrolet Corvette|Corvette]]s.  DKR expanded into the [[FIA GT Championship]] in 2009 where PSI had previously competed, running their own program under the '''Sangari Team Brazil''' banner and netting a single victory and sixth in the Teams' Championship.  DKR's FFSA GT squad won five races in 2009 and secured the Drivers' Championship for [[Eric Debard]].

In 2010 DKR Engineering partnered with fellow Corvette campaigner [[Selleslagh Racing Team]] to compete as a two-car team under [[Mad-Croc Racing]] banner in the [[FIA GT1 World Championship]].  After a single victory over the season, Selleslagh and DKR will split, forming their own teams for the 2011 season.

'''Durham Athletic Park''', affectionately known as '''"The DAP"''' (pronounced like "cap"), is a former [[minor league baseball]] stadium in [[Durham, North Carolina]]. The stadium was home to the [[Durham Bulls]] from 1926 through 1994, and is currently home to the [[North Carolina Central Eagles]] and the Durham School of the Arts Bulldogs. As of 2017, the DAP still stands north of the downtown area of Durham, on the block bounded by Washington, Corporation, Foster and Geer Streets.

Durham Athletic Park became one of the most famous minor league ballparks in history thanks to the 1988 film ''[[Bull Durham]]'', featuring the Bulls, [[Kevin Costner]], [[Tim Robbins]] and [[Susan Sarandon]]. Most of the filming was done at the DAP, following the end of the Carolina League season of 1987. The film's wide acclaim helped fuel the burgeoning public interest in minor league ball in general. In the case of both the city and the film, this explosion of popularity caused the DAP to become a victim of its own success; despite expansion with temporary bleachers, it was just too small to handle the increase in crowd size and the Bulls’ [[Triple-A (baseball)|Triple-A]] ambitions. 

The Bulls moved to their new home [[Durham Bulls Athletic Park]] (also known as the "DBAP") in downtown Durham, starting with the 1995 season. Durham Bulls Athletic Park was built with a capacity to Carolina League standards, but the land that the DBAP was built on had more room in case the ballpark needed to be expanded for Triple-A baseball. Triple-A baseball came to Durham in 1998 and the Bulls moved up from High-A to Triple-A, with the DBAP then expanded to Triple-A standards.

==''El Toro'' Park==

===Before ''El Toro''===
In their early days, from 1912–1926, the Durham Bulls, then a [[Class D (baseball)|Class-D]] farm team for the [[Cincinnati Reds]],&lt;ref name="Endangered-DAP" /&gt; played at [[Duke University|Trinity College]]'s [[Hanes Field]],&lt;ref name="ambacco"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.americantobaccohistoricdistrict.com/durham-bulls.html|title= Durham Bulls|publisher=American Tobacco Historic District|accessdate=2010-05-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;—named for the founder of [[Hanes|the clothing company]], a Trinity graduate—now called Williams Field and is still used for field hockey on Duke's east campus.&lt;ref name="Endangered-DAP_schelp"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://endangereddurham.blogspot.com/2008/06/durham-athletic-park.html?showComment=1214593715382#c6875759875579577688|title=Comment-Durham Athletic Park|first=John|last=Schelp|date=2008-06-27|publisher=Endangered Durham|accessdate=2010-05-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===A place to call their own===
On July 7, 1926,&lt;ref name="bullshistory1" /&gt; the Bulls moved about a mile straight east, to a new field called '''El Toro Park''', built atop the streambed of [[Ellerbe Creek]], which was re-routed, underground, through a tunnel beneath the [[pitcher's mound]].&lt;ref name="OWDNA-ECW"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.owdna.org/History/history29.htm |title=Ellerbe Watershed |publisher=Old West Durham Neighborhood Association |accessdate=2010-05-11 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100419105549/http://www.owdna.org/History/history29.htm |archivedate=2010-04-19 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="OWDNA-fosec"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.owdna.org/fosec.htm|title=The Friends of South Ellerbe Creek|publisher=Old West Durham Neighborhood Association|accessdate=2010-05-11|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100311053555/http://www.owdna.org/fosec.htm|archivedate=2010-03-11|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="BCR-dap-photos" /&gt; The stadium, replete with wooden grandstand, was dedicated by the [[Commissioner of Baseball]], [[Kenesaw Mountain Landis]], on July 26, 1926, who rode a live bull—the team mascot—onto the playing field.&lt;ref name="ambacco" /&gt; In 1932, the Bulls became a farm team for the [[Philadelphia Phillies]], becoming part of the [[New York Yankees|Yankees]] organization a year later.&lt;ref name="Endangered-DAP" /&gt; The facility was renamed '''Durham Athletic Park''' during the 1933 offseason, following a $20,000 donation by [[Annie Watts Hill]] and her husband, [[John Sprunt Hill]], that enabled the City of Durham to purchase the park.&lt;ref name="bullshistory1" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Endangered-DAP"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://endangereddurham.blogspot.com/2008/06/durham-athletic-park.html|title=Durham Athletic Park|publisher=Endangered Durham|date=2008-06-27|accessdate=2010-05-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===The Depression and disaster===

The Bulls sat out the 1934 and 1935 seasons, owing to the [[Great Depression]].&lt;ref name="ambacco" /&gt; For 1936, Cincinnati Reds moved their affiliation ([[Piedmont League]] squad) from the [[Wilmington Pirates]] to Durham, re-activating the Durham Bulls franchise.&lt;ref name="Endangered-DAP" /&gt; On the evening of June 17, 1939,  the wooden Durham Athletic Park was destroyed by a fire that followed a 7-3 win over the [[Portsmouth Cubs]], causing more than $100,000 in damage and nearly killing groundskeeper Walter Williams, who was asleep under the grandstand when the blaze began, shortly after midnight.&lt;ref name="bullshistory1" /&gt;&lt;ref name="ambacco" /&gt;

== The current stadium ==
Less than two weeks after the disastrous fire that completely destroyed the stadium, a new concrete and steel grandstand, seating 1,000 spectators, opened on July 2, 1939, in time for the Bulls to face the [[Charlotte Hornets (baseball)|Charlotte Hornets]],&lt;ref name="bullshistory1" /&gt;&lt;ref name="ambacco" /&gt; as a result, 1939 is the year from which the current DAP is normally dated.

During the off-season of 1939&amp;ndash;1940 the stadium was rebuilt on-site, with 2,000 grandstand seats and portable [[bleacher]]s along the 1st and 3rd base lines. Funding for the completely new stadium was provided by John Sprunt Hill and the design was penned by Durham architect [[George Watts Carr]], who added the park's distinctive conical ticket tower.&lt;ref name="Endangered-DAP" /&gt; The new DAP reopened April 7, 1940 for an exhibition game between the Cincinnati Reds and the [[Boston Red Sox]], with the Bulls, now part of the [[Brooklyn Dodgers|Dodgers]],&lt;ref name="Endangered-DAP" /&gt; playing their first game in the new DAP on April 17, before a crowd of 1,587.&lt;ref name="bullshistory2" /&gt;

===Postwar decline===
The Bulls were re-activated in early 1945, as the Red Sox's Class-C team in the newly established [[Carolina League]], after sitting out for the 1944 season which was a year-long drought of baseball at the DAP, due to [[World War II|the second World War]].&lt;ref name="Endangered-DAP" /&gt; Following a realignment to become part of the [[Detroit Tigers]] club in 1948, the DAP witnessed an important moment in the civil rights movement, when on August 10, 1951, [[Percy Miller, Jr.]], the first black player in the Carolina League made his minor league debut with the visiting [[Danville Leafs]].&lt;ref name="bullshistory2" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Endangered-DAP" /&gt;

Attention to baseball waned in the Bull City, through the 1960s, even after the Bulls became the farm club for the [[Houston Colt .45s]] expansion team. Attendance numbers were down throughout the region, so much that after the 1967 season, the Bulls acquired a Raleigh baseball team from the nearby city of [[Raleigh, North Carolina]] and so the Raleigh club merged into the Durham Bulls, renaming the Durham Bulls the [[Raleigh-Durham Mets]], splitting the season between the DAP and Raleigh's [[Devereaux Meadow]].&lt;ref name="bullshistory2" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Endangered-DAP" /&gt; There is no record on if this Raleigh team is a new team or the [[Raleigh Pirates]]. The team became the [[Raleigh-Durham Phillies]] in 1969 and then the [[Raleigh-Durham Triangles|Triangles]] in 1970, eventually disbanding again after the 1971 season, leaving the stalwart Durham Athletic Park virtually without purpose.&lt;ref name="bullshistory2" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Endangered-DAP" /&gt;

===Reborn again===
As for the Durham Bulls, they came and went over the years, par for the course for minor leagues and their teams. In 1980, the Bulls were revived as a farm team for the [[Atlanta Braves]], by new owner [[Miles Wolff]], after more than a decade of dormancy, returning baseball to the DAP for the first time in 9 years, on April 15, 1980, before a crowd of 4,418.&lt;ref name="bullshistory2" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Endangered-DAP" /&gt; The park was repainted in the bright blue and orange team colors. Over the interior entrance was a sign reading '''El Toro Stadium''', a variation of its original name. The team led the [[Carolina League]] in attendance that first season with 175,963, nearly 30% of the league total of 600,809, and well ahead of Salem which drew 102,456.&lt;ref name="SportNews1981"&gt;{{cite book|title=The Sporting News Official 1981 Baseball Guide|year=1981|page=503}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===''Bull Durham'' and beyond===
The team's popularity received a large boost when the ballpark became the primary setting for the film ''[[Bull Durham]]'', which also contributed to the end of the DAP as an important baseball venue. Increased attendance at the DAP, with frequent capacity crowds, and an interest in attracting a Triple-A franchise prompted the city to build a new ballpark on the other side of the downtown, adjacent to the former [[American Tobacco]] campus. 1993 was promoted as the final season for the DAP, but construction delays compelled the team to play one more season there. In 1994, the club sold T-shirts bearing the legend "2nd Annual Final Season at the DAP". On September 5, 1994 the Bulls played their final game at the DAP, a 6-2 loss to the [[Winston-Salem Spirits]] in Game 1 of the Carolina League's South Division playoffs.&lt;ref name="bullshistory3" /&gt;

In 1995, the Bulls abandoned their home since 1926 and moved to the new '''[[Durham Bulls Athletic Park]]''' or '''"D-BAP"'''. Attendance continued to be so good that the Bulls were promoted to the AAA level 3 years later, when Major League Baseball's most recent round of expansion required the addition of two new AAA teams. Despite the relatively small size of the city, they continue to hold their own in attendance figures among the larger member cities of the [[International League]].&lt;ref name="bullshistory3" /&gt;

== The DAP after the Durham Bulls ==
[[Image:2008-07-26 Durham Athletic Park.jpg|thumb|left|300px|Durham Athletic Park in July, 2008.]]

Following the Bulls departure in September 1994, the DAP was still used for events such as concerts, the [[Bull Durham Blues Festival]], the [[World Beer Festival]]&lt;ref name="Endangered-DAP" /&gt; and softball tournaments, and was the regular home field of the (now defunct) Durham Americans (formerly Durham Braves) of the [[Coastal Plain League]], an [[NCAA]]-sanctioned collegiate summer league.

The Durham Dragons of the Women's Professional Softball League (forerunner to the current [[National Pro Fastpitch League]]) also made the park its home.

From 1998 to 2004, the Durham Athletic Park's main parking lot was home to the [[Durham Farmers' Market]] on Saturday mornings during the Winter.

In the summer of 2005 rumors of baseball being played at the DAP surfaced again.  Nearby [[North Carolina Central University]] announced plans to expand its athletic department to include baseball and identified the DAP as the venue for its home stadium.

===2008–2009 renovation===
In 2008, the City of Durham allocated over $4 million in general obligation bond funds to renovate the DAP; Baltimore developer Struever Bros. Eccles and Rouse was tasked with renovating the historic facility, in the hopes that it will be operated by [[Minor League Baseball#Minor League Baseball.2FNAPBL|Minor League Baseball]] as a training facility for umpires, groundskeepers, and other crew. The DAP will be used for NCCU games and other athletic programming along with concerts, festivals and other events. MiLB is also considering building a Minor League Baseball "fan experience museum" with public-sector support; the buildings at the northeast corner of the ballpark are of the greatest interest for this significant tourist attraction.&lt;ref name="BCR-dap1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bullcityrising.com/2007/04/dap_renovations.html|title=DAP renovations: An inside-the-park homer, for now|publisher=BullCityRising.com|date=2007-04-03|first=Kevin|last=Davis}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="BCR-dap2"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bullcityrising.com/2007/08/dap-milb-next-s.html|title=DAP, MiLB next steps under review by City Council|publisher=BullCityRising.com|date=2007-08-09|first=Kevin|last=Davis}}&lt;/ref&gt; In early 2008, the City of Durham pledged an additional $1 million to the renovation, the money coming from interest earned on unspent bond funds.

The stadium re-opened on August 15, 2009, concluding the renovation with a picnic featuring former Bulls players and local celebrities.&lt;ref name="IndyRenovations"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.indyweek.com/triangleoffense/archives/2009/08/15/the-dap-reopens-and-its-glory-days-are-no-longer-a-distant-memory|title= The DAP reopens, and its glory days are no longer a distant memory|first=Mike|last=Potter|work=[[Independent Weekly]]|date=2009-08-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="BCR-20090817"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bullcityrising.com/2009/08/bcrs-daily-fishwrap-report-for-august-17-2009.html|title=BCR's Daily Fishwrap Report for August 17, 2009|publisher=BullCityRising.com|date=2009-08-17|first=Kevin|last=Davis}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===The Bulls return to the DAP===
On the evening of May 10, 2010, before a crowd of 3,911,&lt;ref name="N-OMorrisReturn"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.newsobserver.com/2010/05/11/476820/bulls-relive-past-in-a-night-at.html |title=Bulls relive past in a night at the DAP |last=Morris |first=Ron |work=[[The News &amp; Observer]] |date=2010-05-11 |accessdate=2010-05-11 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100514163709/http://www.newsobserver.com/2010/05/11/476820/bulls-relive-past-in-a-night-at.html |archivedate=2010-05-14 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; the-now [[Triple-A (baseball)|Class AAA]] Durham Bulls returned to The DAP for a single regular-season game against the [[Toledo Mud Hens]].

Among other events scheduled for 2011 was another return to the DAP by the Bulls, again on the second Monday night in May.[http://www.durhambulls.com/team/press_release.html?id=1437] The game was played on May 9 and resulted in a loss to the [[Indianapolis Indians]].[http://www.durhambulls.com/team/game_story.html?id=1672&amp;y=2011]

===MiLB Departs the DAP===
On September 2, 2011, Minor League Baseball announced that it would not renew its contract to manage the DAP.  The Durham Bulls announced on December 27, 2011, that they will be assuming the operating agreement from Minor League Baseball.&lt;ref name="NO-milbdeparts"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.durhambaseballnotes.com/2011/12/dap-under-new-management.html|title=The DAP under new management|first=George|last=Habel|work=[[Capital Broadcasting Co]]|date=2011-12-27|accessdate=2011-12-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''foilboard''' or '''hydrofoil board''' is a [[surfboard]] with a [[hydrofoil]] that extends below the board into the water.  This design causes the board to leave the surface of the water at various speeds. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web  |title= Stand Up Guys |author= TonyKlarich |work= Adventures in Water Skiing: Part 4, Hydrofoiling |year= 2012 |url= http://tonyklarich.com/Tony_Klarich_Website/AWS.html |accessdate= May 14, 2012}}
&lt;/ref&gt; 

[[Laird Hamilton]], a prominent figure in the invention of big wave [[tow-in surfing]], later discovered the foilboard's capability to harness swell energy with the use of a jet ski, pulling the rider into a wave.&lt;ref&gt; {{cite web  |title= Laird Hamilton: A Surfermag.com exclusive interview |author= Scott Bass |work= [[Surfer (magazine)|Surfer Magazine]] |year= 2009 |url= http://www.surfermag.com/features/onlineexclusives/lairdintrvu/ |accessdate= December 2, 2010}}
&lt;/ref&gt; Mango Carafino, a big wave tow surfing athlete and water sport instructor from the Hawaiian Island of Maui, was one of the early developers of the hydrofoil board design for stand-up hydro foil boarding (kitesurfing) applications. The stand-up design allows the rider to glide with the moving wave. Hydrofoil kiteboards allow the rider to achieve the same result with the use of a kite.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Carafino Hydrofoils | url=http://carafinohydrofoils.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; The hydrofoil eliminates the effects of choppy or rough conditions. Due to the hydrofoil's underwater characteristics, the rider can angle higher into the wind than on traditional kiteboards which ride on the surface of the water.

[[File:Windfoil.jpg|thumb|right|Windsurf Hydrofoil with Deep Tuttle Box fin system]]
As a result of reduced friction, hydrofoils can attain high speeds and lift at lower speeds compared to conventional designs.  Foils are used on wind-surfboards through design development from Neil Pryde Maui, inventors of hydrofoil sailing "windsurfing" boards{{Citation needed|date=June 2016}}. Using a moderately sized sail, a foil windboard can achieve speeds over 6 knots faster than the apparent wind.

In 2017, Liftfoils, a small company from Puerto Rico, introduced the world to the first self-propelled electric foilboard. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web  |title= How We Built an Electric Flying Surfboard from the Ground Up |author=   Nicholas Leason |work= Liftfoils |year= 2017 |url= https://www.liftfoils.com/blogs/news/how-efoil-came-to-be |accessdate= Aug 14, 2017}}

The '''Georgia Sports Hall of Fame''' is located in [[Macon, Georgia]], USA. It is the largest state [[sports]] [[hall of fame]] in [[United States|America]] at {{convert|43000|sqft|m2|-2}}. 

==Exhibitions==
The Hall of Fame houses over {{convert|14000|sqft|m2|-2}} of exhibit space broken down into sections including Hall of Fame Inductees, [[High school (North America)|High School]], [[collegiate sports]], [[Olympic Games|Olympic]], [[Paralympic]], Professional Sports, and Great Moments in Georgia Sports History areas. Interactive exhibits in the [[museum]] include [[NASCAR]] [[simulator]]s, [[basketball]] and [[American football|football]] games, and [[computer programs]].

==Governance==
The Hall of Fame is owned by the state of Georgia and operated by the Georgia Sports Hall of Fame Authority. It is governed by an 18-member Authority appointed by the Governor, Lt. Governor, and Speaker of the House of Representatives of the State of Georgia.

==History==
The Hall of Fame portion of the museum was created in 1956 as the Georgia Prep Sports Hall of Fame. In 1963 it was expanded to encompass prep, college, amateur and professional sports. In 1978 the Georgia Sports Hall of Fame was officially created by the Georgia State Legislature. Then, in 1994 the state of Georgia appropriated $6.5 million to construct the Sports Hall of fame museum, and added another $1.8 million in 1996. The total construction of the building and its exhibits cost $8.3 million. The building opened in 1999 and had more than 65,000 visitors during its first year of operations. Yearly operations are partially funded by the State of Georgia and partnerships with local organizations provide in-kind contributions and relationships. Additional fundraising is continued through facility rentals, a 5k walk, and Hall of Fame induction-ceremony table sales.

==Meetings==
Meetings for the inductions process for the Georgia State Hall of Fame are now all open to the public. While inductee selection was always public, screening meetings only recently became open and it is considered somewhat controversial. To date, over 300 members have been inducted into the Hall of Fame.

==Rentals==
The Georgia Sports Hall of Fame has developed extensive rental programs aimed at youth, and area organizations. Youth party possibilities (price varies on number of attendees) include admission to the museum, catering availability, access to chairs and tables, and use of the Georgia room for two hours. Equipment rentals are available for parties including: [[TV]]/[[VCR]], overhead projectors, portable screens and easels. In addition to youth parties, the Hall of Fame also offers rentals of the Conference Room (capacity 15), the Georgia Room (in classroom, banquet, reception or theater style), the Rotunda (Banquet or Reception style) and the Theater (205 capacity)

==The Building==
The building itself was built to resemble a turn-of-the-century ballpark, with red-brick exterior and green roof. From the old style ticket booths to the brick columns in the rotunda and special lighting the Hall of Fame was created to put visitors into the heart of a sports experience. Over 1,000 artifacts are on display in the building and over 7,000 objects in the Hall of Fame collection. In addition to the exhibits, the building also houses a {{convert|1500|sqft|m2|-1|sing=on}} "Georgia Room" for rentals and receptions, a gift shop, a 205-seat theater, a research center, staff offices and storage space.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3106">'''Ice hockey rules''' define the parameters of the sport of [[ice hockey]]. The sport is governed by several organizations including the [[International Ice Hockey Federation]] (IIHF), the [[National Hockey League]] (NHL), [[Hockey Canada]], [[USA Hockey]] and others. The rules define the size of the [[hockey rink]] where a game is played, the playing and safety equipment, the game definition, including time of play and whether tie-breaking methods are used and the actual playing rules themselves. The IIHF rule book is used in both amateur and professional leagues worldwide. The NHL's rule book is the basis for the rule books of most North American professional leagues. The IIHF, amateur and NHL rules evolved separately from amateur and professional Canadian ice hockey rules of the early 1900s.{{sfn |Podnieks |Szemberg |2007 |p=198}}

Hockey Canada rules define the majority of the amateur games played in Canada. USA Hockey defines the same for the [[United States]] (US). US [[high school]] leagues use the [[National Federation of State High School Associations]] rule book, and [[Varsity team|varsity]] [[University|college]] hockey is governed by the [[National Collegiate Athletic Association]]'s rules.

Hockey Canada and USA Hockey's rule books differ primarily in technical matters such as the severity of [[Penalty (ice hockey)|penalties]] handed out for various fouls. IIHF rules differ a bit more due to the differences in the dimensions of North American [[hockey rink]]s from those in the rest of the world. In recent times, both USA Hockey and Hockey Canada have been trying to make their rules more similar to the international rules. The merits of this move toward a more standardized rule book, however, are debated in amateur hockey circles.

In recent years, the low scores of NHL games have prompted the league to debate a wide variety of rule change proposals including enlarging the size of the goal, widening the [[Hockey rink#Lines|blue and red lines]] to create a larger offensive zone, restricting where [[goaltender]]s can handle the puck, breaking ties with a [[Penalty shot (ice hockey)|penalty shot]] shootout, and eliminating the [[offside (ice hockey)|two-line pass]] rule.

'''Inline skates''' are a type of [[roller skates|roller skate]] used for [[inline skating]]. Unlike [[quad skates]], which have two front and two rear wheels, inline skates typically have two to five wheels arranged in a single line. Some, especially those for recreation, have a rubber "stop" or "brake" block attached to the rear of one or occasionally both of the skates so that the skater can slow down or stop by leaning back on the foot with the brake skate.

The modern style of inline skates was developed as a substitute for ice skates, for use by a Russian athlete{{who|date=October 2017}} training on solid ground for [[Winter Olympic Games|Olympic]] [[speed skating|long track speed skating]] events{{CN|date=October 2017}}. ''[[Life (magazine)|Life]]'' magazine published a photo of American skater [[Eric Heiden]], training for the 1980 Olympics, using such skates on a Wisconsin road.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite document|title=LIFE In sports|publisher=Harper &amp; Row|last=Whittingham|first=Richard|pages=236–237|publication-date=1985|postscript=&lt;!--None--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the late 1980s and early 1990s, [[Rollerblade]], Inc., a company founded by Scott and Brennan Olson in [[Minneapolis, Minnesota]], widely promoted inline skating through the registered [[trademark]] ''Rollerblade''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

==History==
[[John Joseph Merlin]] experimented with single- to many-rowed devices worn on feet in 1760.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?ei=tmLPTIvYHpWSjAe5__XXBw&amp;ct=result&amp;id=07W7AAAAIAAJ&amp;dq=A+French+-+The+Ingenious+Mechanick&amp;q=wheels#search_anchor|title=John Joseph Merlin: the ingenious mechanick - Iveagh Bequest, Kenwood (London, England), Greater London Council. Public Relations Branch - Google Books|publisher=|accessdate=15 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Inline skates, skates designed to work like ice skates during periods of warm weather, were invented by Louis Legrange of [[France]] in 1849.&lt;ref name="McKenna 11"&gt;McKenna p. 11&lt;/ref&gt; Legrange designed the skates for an opera where a character was to appear to be skating on ice.&lt;ref name="McKenna 11"/&gt; The skates were problematic and unsuccessful as the wearer could not turn nor could they stop.&lt;ref name="McKenna 11"/&gt;

At some point between 1895 and 1899 the UK engineering company [[D. Napier &amp; Son]] made Ritter "road skates", which had two comparatively large wheels, front and back, on each skate.&lt;ref&gt;CH Wilson &amp; WJ Reader, ''Men &amp; Machines: D Napier &amp; Son 1808-1958'', Weidenfeld &amp; Nicolson, London, 1958, Page 58 and facing Page 45.&lt;/ref&gt;

The first U.S. patent for modern in-line skates, designed to behave like ice runners with individually sprung and cushioned wheels, was granted under patent number {{Cite patent|US|2644692}} in July, 1953 to Ernest Kahlert of Santa Ana, CA. They were briefly described in the April 1950 issue of "Popular Mechanics" and again in the April 1954 issue of "Popular Science" in the section called "New Ideas from the Inventors."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.popsci.com/archive-viewer?id=xyADAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=120&amp;query=skate+to+have+wheels|title=PopSci Archive Viewer - Popular Science|work=Popular Science|accessdate=15 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Inline skates appear in the 1962 Russian film Koroleva benzokolonki (Gas Station Queen) at 9m23s. In Canada in 1972, Mountain Dew attempted to sell [[Mettoy]]'s product the "Skeeler", an inline skate that was developed for Russian hockey players and speed skaters.&lt;ref&gt;''The Hockey News'' volume 25–number 34, August 1972&lt;/ref&gt;

The first commercially available inline skate for this form of [[Rollerskating]] is in 1987 by [[Rollerblade]]. In 1996, [[Jason Lewis (adventurer)|Jason Lewis]] completed the first solo crossing of the USA on inline skates, part of [[Expedition 360]], a successful attempt to circumnavigate the globe using only human power.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Guinness World Records|title=Human Powered Circumnavigations|url=http://www.expedition360.com/guinness_world_records_first_hpc.pdf|date=6 October 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=AdventureStats by Explorersweb|title=Global HPC – Human Powered Circumnavigations|url=http://www.adventurestats.com/tables/hpc.shtml|publisher=Explorersweb}}&lt;/ref&gt; En route he was hit by a car in Colorado, breaking both legs. After nine months he completed the journey from Fort Lauderdale to San Francisco. In 2012, [[Kacie Fischer]] became the first woman, and the fastest person, to inline skate across the United States; she skated from California to Florida in 47 days.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ocregister.com/articles/record-360229-roads-days.html|title=O.C. woman breaks record for skating across U.S. - The Orange County Register|work=The Orange County Register|accessdate=15 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Parts==
[[Image:Inline-figure-skates.jpg|thumb|An inline skate designed for artistic roller skating]]

A skate is composed of a ''boot,'' worn on the foot. To the boot is attached a ''frame'', which holds the ''wheels'' in place.  ''[[bearing (mechanical)|Bearings]]'' allow the wheels to rotate freely around an axle. Finally, the rubber ''brake'' typically attaches to the frame of the right foot.

There are different types of inline skates for different types of skating such as [[Aggressive inline skating|aggressive skating]], [[Inline speed skating|speed skating]], [[inline hockey]] and [[Artistic roller skating|artistic inline skating]]. Those differ in the boots, frames and wheels that are used.

===Boot===
For most skating a high boot is used, which provides more ankle support and is easier to skate in, particularly for beginners. Speed skaters often use a [[carbon fiber]] boot which provides greater support with a lower cut allowing more ankle flexion.
For recreational skating a soft boot is used for greater comfort, but many other disciplines prefer a harder boot, either to protect the foot against impact or for better control of the skate. The boot may also contain shock absorbent padding for comfort.  Downhill skaters often use boots that are heat-molded to the shape of the foot, with a foam liner.&lt;ref name=Downhill&gt;{{cite book|last=Cook|first=Nick|title=Downhill in-line skating|year=2000|publisher=Capstone Books|location=Mankato, Minn.|isbn=978-0-7368-0482-0|pages=20–21|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=FvTejtf-JkMC&amp;pg=PA13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Most aggressive skates use a hard boot or a hard/soft boot for increased support.

===Frame===
[[Image:Inline skate wheels.jpg|thumb|The frame and wheels of an inline skate]]

Typical recreational skates use frames built out of high-grade [[polyurethane]] (plastic). Low-end department or toy store skate frames may be composed of other types of plastic. Speed skate frames are usually built out of [[carbon fiber]] or [[extrusion|extruded]] [[aluminum]] (more expensive but more solid), magnesium, or even pressed aluminium, which is then folded into a frame (cheaper but less sturdy).

Carbon fiber frames are expensive but generally more flexible, making for a smoother ride at the expense of worse power transfer between the leg and the wheels. In general, carbon fiber frames weigh about 160–180&amp;nbsp;grams. Recently, high-end carbon fiber frames with a monocoque construction have been introduced. They offer the same level of stiffness as aluminum frames while weighing only around 130g. Aluminum can weigh from 170 to 240&amp;nbsp;grams. Frame length ranges from 2 wheel framed freestyle wheels (used in [[Aggressive inline skating|aggressive skating]])  to around 230&amp;nbsp;mm for short-framed four wheel skates (used in most inline designs), up to about 325&amp;nbsp;mm for a five-wheel racing frame.

===Bearings===
[[Image:Inline skate bearings.jpg|thumb|[[Axle]]s, bearings and spacers]]

[[Ball bearing]]s allow the wheels to rotate freely and smoothly. Bearings are usually rated on the [[ABEC scale]], a measure of the manufactured precision tolerance, ranging from 1 (worst) to 9 (best) in odd numbers. The ABEC standards were originally intended for high-speed machinery, not skating applications, and do not account for the quality of steel used, which is very important for how long bearings last. While higher rated bearings are generally better in overall quality, whether they automatically translate to more speed is questionable.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.skatefaq.com/articles/abec-hype.html|title=ABEC = HYPE?|publisher=|accessdate=15 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since at least 2007, Rollerblade brand amongst others have begun using their own rating system.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://fitness.inlinewarehouse.com/showthread.php?t=1274|title=Fitness|publisher=|accessdate=15 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;  For instance, Rollerblade brand is currently using a SG1 to SG9 rating system, whereas TwinCam brand is using its own "ILQ" ('''I'''n'''L'''ine '''Q'''ualified) rating system and Bones brand is using its own "Skate Rated" rating system.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bonesbearings.com/support/abec/|title=Abec vs. Skate Rated™ - Support - Bones Bearings|publisher=|accessdate=15 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A mistake that is often made in purchasing bearings is that spending more translates to more speed.  Generally, clean inline skate bearings contribute about 2% of the rolling resistance that the best urethane inline skate wheels produce, so there is very little opportunity in improving speed by spending more money on bearings.{{Citation needed|date=March 2015}} Newer bearings on the market have been offered that use ceramic ball bearings instead of steel, which are more expensive than traditional steel bearings but made of harder material.

Two bearings are used per wheel. The bearings slip into openings molded into each side of the wheel hub, and a flange molded into the wheel hub holds the bearings the correct distance apart. Additionally there is an axle spacer either machined into the axle or that slides over the axle (depending on the axle system used). Since the outer race of the bearing contacts the wheel spacer and the inner race of the bearing contacts the axle spacer, it is critical that the relationship between these two spacers is correct. If the wheel spacer is wider than the axle spacer the bearings will bind when the axle bolt (or bolts) are tightened.{{Citation needed|date=March 2015}}

===Wheels===
[[Image:Inline Skate Wheels.svg|thumb|Inline skate wheels with different diameters and profiles]]

Wheel sizes vary depending on the skating style. Note carefully that the skater's age factors in. The wheel size an adult uses shall not really be the same as a child's:
* 44–72&amp;nbsp;mm for [[Aggressive inline skating|aggressive skating]].
* 47–80&amp;nbsp;mm for [[roller hockey]] skating.
* 68–72&amp;nbsp;mm for artistic inline skating.
* 72–80&amp;nbsp;mm for [[freestyle slalom skating]] and downhill skating.
* 70-90&amp;nbsp;mm for urban skating.
* 72–100&amp;nbsp;mm for general recreational skating.
* 80-90mm for downhill inline skating.
* 100–125&amp;nbsp;mm for tri-skating, mushroom blading, and speed skating.
* 125-150mm tires for off-road skating.

Wheels are nowadays almost universally made of [[polyurethane]] (a kind of durable plastic). Most other plastics and rubber either wear down too quickly or have too much [[rolling resistance]]. In general, the bigger the wheel, the faster the skate. A bigger wheel rolls over road imperfections smoothly thus the less bumpy the skating. On top of that, an inline skater trips far less on large wheels. However, large wheels take more energy to start rolling. Smaller wheels allow faster acceleration, maneuverability, and a lower center of gravity. 

Wheel hardness is measured on the A scale (see [[Durometer]]) and usually ranges between 72A-93A (lower numbers are softer, higher numbers are harder). Harder wheels are not necessarily faster but tend to be more durable; soft wheels may have better grip and are generally less affected by road bumps. Harder wheels (which grant minimal elastic hysteresis energy absorption) maintain rolling speed far better while softer wheels (because they grip the surface) accelerate more straightforwardly when striding. In the 1990s, wheel rolling resistance (CRR – coefficient of rolling resistance) tended to be minimized with wheel hardness in the 78A durometer range, with rolling resistance dramatically increasing below 75A durometer and above 85A durometer.  In the early 2000s, urethane compounds improved significantly, allowing skaters to use harder compounds to get better wheel life, and get the lowest rolling resistance in the 82A–84A durometer range.  

Wheel profiles and thickness again vary by application. Elliptic profiles were thought to minimize friction for a faster ride; however, they were intended to mimic the knife-like properties of an ice blade.They helped define the inner, central and outer edges. Elliptic profiles made the wheel quite maneuverable when turning or otherwise crossing over. More rounded profiles provided lower rolling resistance due to the greater "belly" or tire that increased resilience (or "rebound"); and these wheels were perceived as having better grip and being more stable (less like an ice blade), but were heavier than elliptical-profiled wheels and were often used in downhill racing (such as the Hyper Downhill racing wheels) and in recreational skates. Another advantage of rounded profile wheels is longer wear life due to the increased urethane amount on the tire.  To increase stability at high speed, skates intended for downhill skating usually have five or six wheels, in contrast with recreational skates, which typically have four wheels.&lt;ref name=Downhill /&gt;  This advantage of more wheels having less rolling resistance has been largely negated by the 100–110mm diameter wheels with 4-wheel trucks. A flat profile allowed the wheel to be even far stabler than the rounded profile. This profile is almost exclusively used on aggressive skate wheels. On the flip-side, the squared-off shape caused cornering to be tremendously harder, seeing how edges are non-existent with a flat profile. In fact, a flat profile has only a center edge preventing the skater from leaning over.

The core's general design i.e. material, shape, and flexibility/sturdiness degree at the wheel's hub determine the wheel's properties as well. In a classical point of view, wheels on older skate models (during the 1980s and early 1990s) contained no core feature whatsoever. The core is a result of the gradual technological improvement inline skating underwent. Above all else, a wheel lacking a core is prone to deformation. This deformation is a hindrance to the skater's striding ability since in such a case it minimizes the skater's top speed. The core is inserted to hold the polyurethane firmly in place. Despite the setback, markets still distribute special wheels without a core.  Core designs vary among open, full or semi-open. 'Spokes' are an element seen in wheels whose cores are open which generally increase overall wheel lightness. These are inserted into the hubs of wheels for inline speed skates, fitness skates, recreational skates, some slalom skates and artistic/figure inline skates. Apart from spokes, other open-cores can be hollowed out internally. The main disadvantage about an open core is that their design does not permit sturdiness hence they are highly likely to snap under too much pressure i.e. when jumping. Another trade-off with open cores is the lesser amount of polyurethane around it to compensate for the spoked or hollow shape meaning they last shorter. Full cores are entirely solid, akin to a pipe's cross-section. This core design is mostly favored amongst aggressive skaters whose leaps off higher levels strain the wheels when landing. Of course, these cores (alongside the extra polyurethane) tend to add weight on the wheel. Some even disfavor the full core design for its rigidity that feels uncomfortable. The question still stands on whether a full core improves power transfer. Semi-open cores are a hybrid between the two previously mentioned cores seen on wheels for urban skates, slalom skates and inline hockey skates. Minuscule holes are typically punctured into these solid cores to provide a semi-open design.

===Heel brakes or toe stops===
[[File:Heel brake.jpg|thumb|right|Heel brake]]
A hard rubber brake attached to the heel of the frame allows the skater to stop by lifting the toes of the skate, forcing the brake onto the ground. Learning how to use the heel brake is very important for beginners, as it is the easiest way to stop in emergencies and to control speed on downhills.

Heel brakes can interfere with a useful technique called a crossover turn, in which a skater crosses one leg over another to make a sharp turn without losing much speed; for this reason, most intermediate to advanced users prefer not to use heel brakes. Skaters in the [[freestyle slalom]] and [[aggressive inline skating]] disciplines don't use heel brakes, since they limit the skater's ability to perform tricks effectively. Aggressive inline skates and racing skates generally have no heel brake, thereby permitting extra speed and control.

Inline skaters lacking a heel brake can use various other methods to stop, such as the T-stop in which the skater moves one skate perpendicular to the other, making a "T" shape to increase friction and reduce speed, or the more advanced maneuver of a [[hockey stop]]/[[snow plow stop]], in which the skater quickly moves both skates perpendicular to the path of motion.

For [[artistic roller skating]] purposes, [[inline figure skating|inline figure skates]] can also feature a "toe stop" which aids in performing [[figure skating jumps]].

==Setups==
{{unreferenced section|date=January 2013}}
{{original research|section|date=January 2013}}

===Flat Setup===
A flat setup is the most common setup used on inline skates. Almost all non-aggressive inline skates are sold with a flat wheel setup. Flat means that all the wheels touch the ground at the same time when resting on flat ground. Flat setups are not the most maneuverable but what they lack in maneuverability they make up for in speed. Flat setups tend to be the fastest setups, compared to setups such as the Hi-Lo or anti-rocker. The presence of two middle wheels matching the diametrical size of the rest increases contact points with any surface.  They also minimize the rate at which the skater's loading weight deforms the wheels. This minimizes the wheel's footprint thereby minimizing rolling resistance. [[Inline speed skating|Speed skaters]] and marathon skaters normally use flat setups. As a side note on skating technique, due to the setup maximizing contact, a daring inline skater is capable of gliding down a flight of stairs whether backwards naturally or forwards. This has been termed 'bashing'. One other advantageous consideration with this setup is the [[Powerslide (inline skating)|powerslide]], an advanced braking method.

Aggressive skates are sometimes sold with flat setups, but with a small space in the middle for grinding. With aggressive skates, the flat setup obviously leads to better control on the ground when either accelerating on a push or decelerating on a drag because of increased traction. What's more it grants a faster speed, translating to faster grinds, more powerful pumps in a skate ramp and/or higher heights ('airs') off the edge of a vert ramp. Indeed, flat setups are quick save for the likelihood that they will be heavier and the two standard central wheels tend to 'bite' when grinding. Similar to skateboarding in certain respects, 'biting' is a common hindrance during grinding whereby friction between the wheel(s) and surface it comes into contact causes the wheel(s) then entire boot to suddenly reach a halt and the momentum throws the aggressive inline skater off the rail or ledge. Again, the aspect of wheel profile is key here. A harder wheel on a flat setup will slide and 'bite' less than a softer wheel. Likewise an elliptical profile (Undercover's Dustin Werbeski 'super bullet' wheels for example) possesses less surface area hence it will not bite as much either. Adjusting to a flat setup can even out shock when landing jumps. In doing so, an inline skater's hardware like wheels, bearings, axles and the frame itself are twice as much to be spared damage.

[[image:Flat inline.svg|frame|200px|center|A 'flat' inline setup]]

It is worth noting that having a flat setup is just one factor in a fast skate setup. A long frame, low resistance bearings, and good technique all contribute greatly to a skater's speed.

===Full 'crescent/banana' Rocker===
Full rockers are used by skaters who favor maneuverability when skating on flat ground. Freestyle skaters, [[freestyle slalom skaters]] and artistic inline skaters tend to use this setup. Inline hockey players no less can customize their wheels to implement this setup (especially those who favor nimble change in direction over sheer speed during a match). This setup is called "crescent" or "banana" because it is curved, and mimics a curved ice blade profile. On flat ground this setup will only have 1–2 wheels touching the ground at any one time. This makes the skate much easier to pivot but lacks stability so it is harder to balance on. To attain balance when learning to skate a full rocker, it is recommended that pressure and weight are deposited on either the two middle wheels or the two wheels in the back. Avoid applying pressure on the two front wheels when taking strides since this is what will cause instability. In addition, a full rocker is slower than a flat setup in terms of top speed. Worst of all at high speeds, skates with a full rocker setup can experience a speed wobble, where they oscillate uncontrollably. The skater may lose control and crash to the ground.
[[image:Full Rocker.svg|frame|200px|center|A full 'crescent/banana' rocker inline setup]]

Flat setups generally wear into a 'natural' rocker. This is because the front and back wheels seem to receive the vast majority of wear on inline skates.

Having a short frame (230mm–245mm) in combination with a full rocker is optimum for achieving the highest maneuverability when skating.

===Front Rocker===
Front rockers are often used by street skaters who want to combine the ability of a full rocker to handle imperfections in the ground with a flat setup’s sheer speed. Having a smaller wheel at the front encourages the front wheel to guide the rest of the skate over ground imperfections, rather than digging in and tripping up the less experienced skater. Maintaining a flat profile at the back allows the skater to transfer power through the rear of the skate efficiently to maintain a good speed.

[[image:Front Rocker.svg|frame|200px|center|A front rocker inline setup]]

===‘Hi-Lo’ Setup===
Some hockey skates like Bauer, Mission, Alkali and CCM brands, fitness skates like K2's VO2 100 X Pro and inline speed skates include a Hi-Lo setup. Hi-Lo setups resemble a flat setup in that all 4 wheels touch the ground at the same time. Unlike a flat setup, however, different wheel sizes are used. The front two wheels will be smaller than the back two wheels. This is possible because of the location of the axles on the frame itself. One example is a Bauer frame that has two wheels in the front that are 76mm and two wheels in the back that are 80mm. Another example is a 74mm-76mm-78mm-80mm wheel arrangement. This drastically changed the pace at which inline hockey players accelerated. Furthermore by transferring weight forward, the skater could sprint explosively off the toe section and reduce instances of falling backwards. If the hockey skate is used recreationally outside the arena, the skater will find climbing slopes much easier than on a flat setup. Owing to the fact that inline hockey skate manufacturers design frames with varying axle hole placements or even raise the frame's back bolt to be higher than the front bolt nowadays, wheels of the same diameter (like 80mm) can be used entirely.

Beyond inline hockey, the Hi-Lo setup was an experimental component seen on K2's VO2 100 X Pro where the manufacturers believed that the two smaller wheels (90mm each) in front would increase stability and rate of acceleration while the two bigger wheels (100mm each) in the back would maintain high speeds. Essentially this K2 skate model married both wheel size properties. A Hi-Lo configuration on an inline speed skate employs three large sized wheels and a smaller sized wheel between the first and third wheels beneath the ball part of the foot (see [[Inline speed skating|speed skates]]). An example is a 110mm-100mm-110mm-110mm arrangement beginning front to back. This increases efficiency now that the foot pushes on a smaller wheel. The smaller wheel lowers deck height off the ground improving stability and keeps the frame length shorter improving maneuverability and comfort amongst speed skaters having a smaller foot size. This is desirable seeing how wheels on inline speed skates are enormous enough to occupy a lot of room in frames. Unfortunately, top speed for a Hi-Lo setup is far less than that for a flat setup where same sized large wheels are used.

==='TriDi' Hi-Lo Setup===
Another variant of the setup in which there are three diameters of wheels. It is supposed to emphasize the same benefits as the HiLo system but with greater maneuverability due to the smaller front wheels. The configuration is 72mm, 76mm, 76mm, 80mm.

===Aggressive Hi-Lo Setup===
A few aggressive skate frames (most notably Rollerblade's Switch Frame, Ground Control's Bullet Frame, and Oysi Frame) are designed so that there are two big outer wheels, and two small inner wheels, rockered so that they all touch the ground. This gives the benefits of a flat setup, while giving the rollerblader more space to grind on the H-block between the wheels.

===Anti-rocker===
Anti-rocker is the most popular setup for aggressive skaters. An anti-rocker wheel is a small hard wheel that replaces the two middle wheels.  Anti-rocker wheels almost never touch the ground except in cases where the terrain is uneven, such as skating over a ramp. Anti-rockers can be made of plastic, or high density polyurethane. Some use bearings so that they can spin. As they can spin, the anti-rockers wear out more evenly when grinding. Anti-rockers containing bearings can effectively roll over uneven ground or features like steps, lessening tripping hazards. Others do not use bearings so that they're lighter. The anti-rockers themselves lock the H-block onto the ledge or rail a skater grinds. There is a minor nuisance to anti-rocker hardware in which the items emit a loud noise upon fastening into a grind that some aggressive skaters find unbearable. The anti-rocker setup altogether makes maneuvering harder (since the standard wheels slip more), wheel life shorter, overall speed slower, a rougher ride, and a wider turning radius, but because of the extra space in the middle, it makes grinding objects much easier than with a flat setup.

===Freestyle===
The freestyle frame is another setup used by aggressive skaters. This setup simply has only two wheels – one in the front and one in the back. In between the two wheels is an area of solid material, resembling a large "H Block", which is used for grinding. Freestyle frames have nearly identical advantages to the Anti-rocker. Since large space is freed up in the middle, the skater can not only grind wider surface areas like an entire ledge but also the frame's weight is lighter. Likewise, the Freestyle frame shares its disadvantages with its Anti-rocker cousin already listed. As opposed to anti-rockers which securely lock grinds, aggressive skaters should train themselves to remain balanced when sliding across narrow rails or edges on a Freestyle frame. Worse still when not observing carefulness, a Freestyle setup can easily hook on vertical surfaces including steps, coping and funbox edges if you roll over them, leading to tripping incidents. This is why the technique to 'bash' (see ''Flat Setup'') a staircase is almost impossible on a Freestyle setup. Freestyle frames can be purchased, although removing the two inner wheels of a flat or anti-rocker frame technically makes it freestyle, however this would not be very durable due to the lack of solid grinding material. Purchasing an invention by Create Originals (an aggressive inline skate frame company) called Juice Blocks allows the skater to convert their flat or anti-rocker frames into proper freestyle frames. Juice Blocks are simply solid grind blocks inserted into the axle holes where two middle wheels or anti-rockers are found.

===Tri-rocker===
Tri-rocker (not to be confused with the 3-wheeled frame/chassis seen on Tri-Skates) is used by some aggressive skaters. It is another method of making grinds easier. A frame with a tri-rocker setup has only one wheel in the middle, either in the second wheel position or in the third wheel position, depending on what kinds of grinds the skater plans on doing. The remaining axle has an anti-rocker wheel, a special grind block, or is just left empty.

The purpose of a tri-rocker setup is to give the skater good speed and maneuverability, like on a flat setup. But because of the extra space, grinding is also a little easier than a flat setup.

'''Isaac Hatch''' (dates unknown) was an English [[first-class cricket|first-class]] [[cricket]]er who was active in the 1780s. He had [[Amateur status in first-class cricket|amateur status]] and played for [[Kent county cricket teams|Kent]]. He was recorded playing for Kent against [[White Conduit Club]] at [[White Conduit Fields]] in June 1786, scoring 0 and 7.&lt;ref&gt;Haygarth, p.64.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="CA74"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://cricketarchive.com/Archive/Scorecards/0/74.html |publisher=''CricketArchive'' |title=White Conduit Club v Kent 1786 |accessdate=20 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As Hatch had established his reputation by 1786, he must have been active for some years previously. Very few players were mentioned by name in contemporary reports and there are no other references to Hatch.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="12075">A '''lucky loser''' is a sports player who loses a match in the qualifying round of a [[knockout tournament]], but who then enters the main draw when another player withdraws after the tournament has started because of illness, injury or other reason.  The lucky loser then enters the main draw, normally in place of the withdrawn player. This can only happen before all players in the main draw have started their first match in the tournament.

==Lucky losers as tennis tournament winners and finalists==

It is rare for a lucky loser to win an [[Association of Tennis Professionals|ATP]] or [[Women's Tennis Association|WTA]] tournament; [[Heinz Gunthardt]] did it in 1978 (at Springfield), [[Bill Scanlon]] in 1978 (at Maui),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://fultonhistory.com/Newspaper%2011/Geneva%20NY%20Daily%20Times/Geneva%20NY%20Daily%20Times%201978%20Oct%201978%20Grayscale/Geneva%20NY%20Daily%20Times%201978%20Oct%201978%20Grayscale%20-%200257.pdf | title=Finger Lakes Times: Scanlon win in Hawaii | accessdate=19 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Francisco Clavet]] in 1990 in [[1990 Dutch Open (tennis)|Hilversum]], [[Christian Miniussi]] in 1991 in [[ATP São Paulo|São Paulo]], [[Sergiy Stakhovsky]] in 2008 in [[2008 PBZ Zagreb Indoors|Zagreb]], [[Rajeev Ram]] in 2009 in [[2009 Campbell's Hall of Fame Tennis Championships|Newport]], [[Andrey Rublev (tennis)|Andrey Rublev]] in 2017 in [[2017 Croatia Open Umag|Umag]], [[Leonardo Mayer]] in the following week in 2017 in [[German Open Tennis Championships|Hamburg]] and [[Marco Cecchinato]] at the [[Hungarian_Open_(tennis)|Hungarian Open]] in 2018.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Champion Cecchinato: Italian Wins Maiden Title|url=http://www.atpworldtour.com/en/news/cecchinato-millman-budapest-2018-final|accessdate=30/04/2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; In total, nine men and two women have done it from 1978 through 2018.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.tenniscanada.com/why-losing-can-be-lucky-in-tennis/ | title=Why losing can be lucky in tennis | accessdate=19 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In March 1980, [[Kay McDaniel]] won a WTA minor league title in Atlanta as a lucky loser,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.espn.com/sports/tennis/news/story?id=1967475 | title=Czink fails to go from loser to champ | accessdate=2 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; but the WTA recognizes [[Andrea Jaeger]], September 1980 Las Vegas, as the first lucky loser to win a WTA title (though no tournament sources have been found to back up the WTA claim).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://usatoday30.usatoday.com/sports/tennis/2010-06-21-weekly-net-post_N.htm | title=Lucky losers take a chance on chance | accessdate=19 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Olga Danilović]] won a WTA event as a lucky loser in [[2018 Moscow River Cup|Moscow]] in 2018, where some sources have claimed she is the first women to win a main tour WTA singles title as a lucky loser.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title=Danilovic claims first title in Moscow after all-teen tussle | url=http://www.wtatennis.com/news/danilovic-claims-first-title-moscow-after-all-teen-tussle | date = 29 July 2018 | accessdate = 1 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Three men's doubles teams have won a tournament as lucky losers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Tecau clinches Bucharest treble with Rojer; Huta Galung/Robert win in Barcelona|url=http://www.atpworldtour.com/News/Tennis/2014/04/17/Barcelona-Bucharest-Doubles-Final.aspx|publisher=[[Association of Tennis Professionals]] (ATP)|date=27 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Lucky losers who have reached the finals of a tennis tournament and lost include [[Andreas Haider-Maurer]], who reached the final in 2010 [[2010 Bank Austria-TennisTrophy – Singles|Vienna]] before losing to top-seeded [[Jürgen Melzer]], and [[Marcel Granollers]] who lost against [[David Ferrer]] in 2010 Valencia. On the women's side [[Melinda Czink]] reached the final of the 2005 [[Canberra International]], but lost to [[Ana Ivanovic]], who had also defeated Czink in the final round of qualifying.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.abc.net.au/news/2005-01-15/ivanovic-wins-canberra-classic/619852 Ivanovic wins Canberra Classic - ABC News (Australian Broadcasting Corporation)]&lt;/ref&gt; In 2012, [[Coco Vandeweghe]] finished runner-up to Serena Williams at the Bank of the West Classic in Stanford.

==Ethical issues and change in policy in tennis==

In tennis, the rule for choosing a player to enter the main draw as a lucky loser is as follows: from all players eliminated in the final round of qualifying, the highest-ranked player in the [[Association of Tennis Professionals|ATP]] or [[Women's Tennis Association|WTA]] rankings is the first one to enter the draw, followed by the second highest-ranked player and so on (if more players withdrew before the start of the tournament). On rare occasions that there are more late withdrawals than losers in the last qualifying rounds or players eligible for lucky losers are not available, a player who lost in the penultimate round of qualifying may enter as lucky loser.

Prior to the [[2005 Wimbledon Championships]], American player [[Justin Gimelstob]] faced [[George Bastl]] from Switzerland in the final qualification round. Gimelstob, who was the highest-ranked player remaining in the qualifying tournament, aggravated a chronic back complaint during his second qualification match against [[Vladimir Voltchkov]]. Gimelstob planned to withdraw before the match with Bastl, and informed his opponent of his intent. However, officials suggested that Gimelstob play at least one game, as it was almost certain someone would withdraw from the main draw before the tournament started, giving Gimelstob a good chance of getting a berth as a lucky loser (as well as giving him time for his back to recover).&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last=Bricker | first=Charles | journal=South Florida Sun-Sentinel | title=Gimelstob is a lucky loser | date=June 19, 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; Gimelstob did indeed enter the main draw as a lucky loser after the withdrawal of [[Andre Agassi]],  reaching the third round, where he lost to [[Lleyton Hewitt]].

While Gimelstob's behavior was not generally considered unethical, it raised concerns by pointing out that any player in a similar position would have little incentive to play a competitive match. For example, a high-ranking player paired against a lower-ranked friend might deliberately lose the match to help his friend gain entry to the tournament, if the first player had already clinched a lucky loser spot. The possibility of bribery was also a concern.

Shortly thereafter, a new policy was introduced in [[Grand Slam (tennis)|Grand Slam]] tournaments. Since 2006, the four highest ranked players who lose in the last round of qualification take part in a four-way random draw, the results of which are used to determine the order in which each player will enter the main draw. Consequently, if only one main draw spot for a lucky loser is available, the highest-ranked loser has just a 25% chance of entering the draw, instead of 100% as in the past.  This element of uncertainty helps to ensure that final-round qualifying matches remain competitive.
However, this rule does not apply in all other tournaments.

==Association football==
After three teams which [[1950 FIFA World Cup qualification|qualified for the 1950 World Cup]] withdrew, several teams which had failed to qualify were invited to replace them, but declined.

In [[1958 FIFA World Cup qualification|qualification for the 1958 World Cup]], [[Israel national football team|Israel]] won the Asia–Africa group without playing a match, after its opponents withdrew as part of [[Boycotts of Israel in sports|a sports boycott]].  FIFA then [[1958 FIFA World Cup qualification (CAF/AFC–UEFA play-off)|required Israel to play off]] against a team drawn from among the other groups' runners up.

The 1960–1999 [[European Cup Winners' Cup]] was intended for the winners of each [[UEFA]] member's domestic [[knockout tournament|knockout]] cup competition. However, where a club won [[Double (association football)|the double]] of both the cup and the [[round-robin tournament|round-robin]] league, it entered the more prestigious [[UEFA Champions League|European Cup]] reserved for league champions, with the losing cup finalist entering the Cup Winners' Cup. Five domestic-cup runners-up won the Cup Winners' Cup: 
[[ACF Fiorentina|Fiorentina]] ([[1960–61 European Cup Winners' Cup|1960–61]]),
[[Rangers F.C.|Rangers]] ([[1971–72 European Cup Winners' Cup|1971–72]]),

and [[FC Barcelona|Barcelona]] ([[1996–97 UEFA Cup Winners' Cup|1996–97]]).&lt;ref name="rsssf"/&gt; Similar provisions now apply for the [[UEFA Champions League|Champions League]] and [[UEFA Europa League|Europa League]] as respective successors to the European Cup and Cup Winners' Cup. 

The [[Intercontinental Cup (football)|Intercontinental Cup]] was intended to be contested by the winners of the European Cup and the [[Copa Libertadores]], but on several occasions the European champions declined to participate and were replaced by the runners-up. [[Atlético Madrid]] in 1975 became the only European loser to win the Intercontinental Cup.&lt;ref name="rsssf"&gt;{{cite web |last1=Stokkermans |first1=Karel |title=Lucky Losers |url=http://www.rsssf.com/miscellaneous/luckylosers.html |website=www.rsssf.com |accessdate=13 July 2018 |publisher=[[Rec.Sport.Soccer Statistics Foundation]] |date=15 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It could be argued{{by whom|date=August 2018}} that US sabre fencer [[Mariel Zagunis]] fits this description, as she did not qualify for the 2004 Athens Olympics in direct qualifying competition (losing the slot on the US team to [[Sada Jacobson]]).  However, when Nigeria withdrew their fencer from the Games, her slot went to the highest ranked fencer who had not already qualified — Zagunis. Zagunis went on to win the gold medal in Women's Sabre at the 2004 Games.

The '''Miracle at the Meadowlands''' was a [[fumble]] recovery by [[cornerback]] [[Herman Edwards]] that he returned for a [[touchdown]] at the end of a November 19, 1978, [[National Football League]] (NFL) game against the [[1978 New York Giants season|New York Giants]] in [[Giants Stadium]]. It is considered miraculous because the Giants were ahead and could easily have run out the final seconds; they had the ball and the Eagles had no [[Sport time-out|timeouts]] left. Everyone watching expected [[quarterback]] [[Joe Pisarcik]] to take one more [[Snap (football)|snap]] and [[quarterback kneel|kneel with the ball]], thus [[running out the clock]] and preserving a 17–12 Giants upset. Instead, he botched an attempt to hand off the football to [[fullback (American football)|fullback]] [[Larry Csonka]]. Edwards  picked up the dropped ball and ran 26 yards for the winning score.

The term is primarily used by Eagles fans and sportscasters. Giants fans refer to the play simply as "'''The Fumble'''", though that name is generally used outside of New York for [[The Fumble|a play in the 1987 AFC Championship Game]] between the [[Cleveland Browns]] and [[Denver Broncos]].

For the Eagles, the victory snatched from the jaws of certain defeat served as a [[morale]] boost, leading that season to a [[NFL playoffs|playoff]] berth and, two seasons later, [[Super Bowl XV|the franchise's first Super Bowl appearance]]. To Giants fans, it was the [[nadir]] of a long era of mediocrity, but the aftermath would lead to major changes that proved beneficial for the franchise in the long run.

==Background==
It was the first meeting between the divisional rivals that season. The Eagles were in third place in the [[NFC East]], behind the [[1978 Dallas Cowboys season|Dallas Cowboys]] and [[1978 Washington Redskins season|Washington Redskins]]; the Giants were in fourth. The teams went into the game in similar situations, but heading in different directions. They had playoff hopes, especially since this was the first 16-game NFL season, but likely would have to settle for a [[Wild card (sports)|wild card]] berth due to the solid lead the powerful Dallas Cowboys had in the division. Given the similarity of their records, it was likely the outcome would have playoff implications, since the first tie-breaker for a wild card spot is the head-to-head record.

===Giants===
Going into the game, the Giants were 5–6. A three-game losing streak on the road had made the team's playoff prospects much dimmer since midseason. However, a win at home against the favored Eagles could, the team hoped, reverse the trend and keep an outside shot at a playoff spot alive. Despite the team's [[History of the New York Giants|storied past]], the Giants had not played in the postseason since 1963 and had managed only two winning seasons since then. Although they were the league's fourth oldest franchise, they were almost a non-entity in the post-[[AFL-NFL Merger|merger]] NFL. The move to [[New Jersey]] in 1976 had alienated some longtime fans, even if it made more seats available. Fans had never gone this long without a contender, but while they were growing restless, they were still forgiving.

However, there was little pressure they could bring to bear on the people who could ultimately make changes, longtime team owners [[Wellington Mara]] and his nephew [[Timothy J. Mara|Tim]], who inherited his father [[Jack Mara|Jack's]] stake in the team after Jack Mara died in 1965. The two managed team operations closely, but feuded so bitterly with each other that at one point a partition had to be erected between their seats in the owners' box. The effects of this uncertainty and instability at the highest managerial level affected the team's play, most significantly when it came to some apparently inexplicable personnel decisions. It was not lost on fans that players ([[Craig Morton]] and [[Fran Tarkenton]]) and coaches ([[Tom Landry]] and [[Vince Lombardi]]) who had once been in the Giants' fold were now enjoying or had enjoyed great success elsewhere. The team also had passed over future stars for less able players in the annual [[NFL draft|draft]].

But all this was for naught. With far more demand for tickets than there were available, the team was financially healthy no matter how poorly it performed on the field, and the Maras were widely viewed as complacent by observers who didn't know the depth of the ownership schism.

====Friction between offensive players and assistant coaches====
The week before the game, players, particularly on offense, had complained to reporters about the team's assistant coaches. Head coach [[John McVay]] was popular with them. He had taken over the team in the middle of the 1976 season after [[Bill Arnsparger]] was fired and improved morale while adding talented players to the team. However, the players were not so enthusiastic about many of the longtime friends he had hired as assistants. The players felt the assistant coaches were uninterested in helping younger players develop, at least compared to their counterparts on other teams. As an example, they pointed out that the season before, none of the team's three quarterbacks had had any previous NFL experience, yet no quarterback coach had been hired. They also noted that one of the few coaches who seemed to care, Jerry Wampfler, coached the [[lineman (football)|offensive line]], one of the Giants' most improved units that season.&lt;ref name="Times pregame"&gt;{{cite news|last=Katz|first=Michael|title=Giants Voice Mutual Animosity|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1978/11/19/archives/giants-voice-mutual-animosity-a-natural-leader-third-and-long-run.html|newspaper=[[The New York Times]]|date=November 19, 1978|accessdate=November 6, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Offensive coordinator]] [[Bob Gibson (football coach)|Bob Gibson]] was the most frequent target of complaints. He had taken to the relatively nascent practice (now quite common) of calling all the plays from the upstairs press box. Pisarcik had often challenged Gibson about this, sometimes openly, over the past two seasons.&lt;ref name="Times pregame" /&gt; The players felt that Gibson should let Pisarcik call plays. They pointed out that during the previous week's loss to Washington, the team had attempted only three passes on several third-and-long situations during the game. They also felt insulted that on a third-and-7 in [[overtime (sport)|overtime]], the coaches had called a run play.&lt;ref name="Times pregame" /&gt; Gibson for his part had limited confidence in Pisarcik's passing ability, an opinion widely shared (the media in New York referred to him as "[[off-Broadway]] Joe", a [[sarcasm|sarcastic]] reference to former [[New York Jets]]' quarterback, [[Joe Namath|"Broadway Joe" Namath]]). He and other coaches pointed out that the three passing attempts the players pointed to had resulted in two [[interception]]s and a [[Quarterback sack|sack]].&lt;ref name="Times pregame" /&gt;

The team's general philosophy at the time was to concentrate on its improving defense and play conservatively on offense until it could be made more competitive. Players on the Giants' offense became frustrated over this decision and wanted more chances to prove themselves.&lt;ref name="Times pregame" /&gt;

===Eagles===
At 6–5, things looked a little more promising for the visitors. The two-game win streak they took into the game had gotten them over a .500 first half. Momentum clearly was on their side, and the Giants had not beaten the Eagles since the opening game of [[1975 NFL season|the 1975 season]], three years prior. Still, the Giants were a decent team, and the Eagles knew they could not relax.

They, too, were an old-line NFL franchise coming off [[History of the Philadelphia Eagles|many years]] in the doldrums.  They had not been to the playoffs since winning their third NFL title in [[1960 NFL Championship Game|1960]], and had only notched two winning seasons in the 17 years since then.  However, their fans were less inclined to be forgiving than Giants' fans. A loss to the slumping Giants would have dealt a severe blow to the confidence the team needed to maintain over the last quarter of its schedule, in which it would face not only the Cowboys, but the equally formidable [[Minnesota Vikings]] as well as the Giants again in Philadelphia. 1978 was also viewed as an important season for head coach [[Dick Vermeil]], as there was little doubt the Eagles were playing much better under his watch, but there was also a great deal of local impatience for concrete results.

The Giants opened a two touchdown lead in the first quarter on two Pisarcik touchdown passes,  and did not give up the lead until the final play of the game. The Eagles, conversely, struggled, missing one of their [[extra point]] attempts and botching the snap on the other. The Eagles found themselves down 17–12, meaning they could only win the game with a touchdown as time wound down.&lt;ref name="Times game story"&gt;{{cite news|last=Katz|first=Michael|title=20 Seconds Left As Eagles Win|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1978/11/20/archives/20-seconds-left-as-eagles-win-jets-bow-todd-reinjured.html|newspaper=The New York Times|date=November 20, 1978|accessdate=November 6, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Deep in their own territory, the Giants' [[Doug Kotar]] fumbled late in the fourth quarter, raising hopes (or fears) of a comeback by the visitors. Those were quickly put to rest, however, when rookie defensive back [[Odis McKinney]]'s first NFL interception gave the Giants possession of the football after the [[two-minute warning]]. The Eagles had exhausted all their timeouts by this point.&lt;ref name="Times game story" /&gt;

Fans in the stands began heading for the exits as the game seemed all but over, with no apparent remaining danger of an Eagles comeback. Nowadays, teams in this situation let the [[play clock]] run down to the last possible second and have the quarterback take a knee. On the sidelines, a disgusted Eagles coach [[Dick Vermeil]] was turning his attention away from the field and toward the postgame [[press conference]], where he would have to explain to reporters why his team had fallen to an inferior opponent.

===The Giants' possession===
Since the rule to allow QBs to simply kneel didn't take effect until 1987, Pisarcik took the snap on first down&lt;ref name="Sequence of plays"&gt;{{cite AV media|people=|year=1978|title=NFL Game of the Week Show #12|time=17 minutes|publisher=NFL Films|id=Tape 52935}}&lt;/ref&gt; and rolled on the ground (a common play for QBs in the pre-kneel era). Eagles [[linebacker|middle linebacker]] [[Bill Bergey]] charged into Giants' [[Center (American football)|center]] [[Jim Clack]], knocking him backward into Pisarcik in a desperate attempt to force a fumble. Since defensive players usually are not blocked in this situation, they usually in turn do not rush. Offensive players consider any breach of this tacit agreement as a provocation, particularly linemen whose job it is to protect the quarterback, and fights between angry linemen and the opposition were not uncommon.

Gibson did not want to expose his quarterback to further risk of injury, nor did he want to risk his players being fined for violating the league's rules against fighting. Most importantly, the last thing he wanted was for his team to get a penalty, which could stop the clock and require getting another first down to secure the win.  He also personally despised the kneeling play, considering it unsporting and somewhat dishonorable (a view popular among a lot of coaches of the period). Also given that the play clock at the time was only 30 seconds (as it would remain through the 1987 season), a play had to be run. So on second down he called "65 Power-Up", a standard play which called for Csonka to take a handoff and run up the middle. Csonka took the ball and ran for 11 yards. For the third play in the Giants' series, the same play was called again.

In the huddle, the Giants were incredulous when the call came in. "Don't give me the ball", begged fullback [[Larry Csonka]], the former [[Miami Dolphins|Dolphins]] star. Other players asked Pisarcik to change the play, but he demurred.&lt;ref name="Times game story" /&gt; Gibson had berated him for changing a play the week before and threatened to have him [[Waivers (American football)|waived]] if he ever did so again. Gibson did not take the time to explain his decision to Pisarcik. As a result, the rest of the offense simply viewed Gibson's call as a power trip. Because he was a second-year starting quarterback who still had not totally proven himself, in the era before [[Free agent|free agency]], Pisarcik lacked the stature to prevail in this kind of dispute.

Csonka claims that, as he walked away from the huddle, he told Pisarcik he would not take the ball if he went through with it. It is not known whether the quarterback heard him or not, however. McVay's headphones, which normally allowed him to communicate with Pisarcik and Gibson, were not working properly at that point either. McVay has since stated that he would certainly have overruled Gibson had he heard what was coming.

Across the line of scrimmage, the Eagles had not huddled, as [[defensive coordinator]] [[Marion Campbell]] called for an all-out 11-man [[Blitz (American football)|blitz]]. Edwards, who as a defensive back normally would have been several yards deep, was instead close enough to Kotar to talk to him (the Giants player assured him that his team was just going to kneel again). Vermeil later said the blitz made the victory possible.

The Giants wasted several seconds in the huddle in dismay over the play-calling. At the line, Clack saw the play clock winding down and took it upon himself to snap it with 31 seconds left in the game to avoid a delay-of-game penalty, which would have stopped the clock and cost the Giants five yards. Had the Giants knelt on the subsequent play, there still would have been one second left on the game clock once the play clock ran down, requiring a fourth-down play to be run (the play clock at the time ran for 30 seconds; it now runs for 40).

Pisarcik, who at the time was distracted making sure Csonka was in position, was unprepared for the snap. It struck his middle finger so hard there was still blood on the nail after the game.&lt;ref name="Times next week story"&gt;{{cite news|last=Katz|first=Michael|title=Giants' Progress is Key Asset for McVay|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1978/11/26/archives/giants-progress-is-key-asset-for-mcvay-friends-in-jeopardy.html|newspaper=The New York Times|date=November 26, 1978|accessdate=November 6, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless, he held on to the ball after a slight bobble and tried to hand it off to Csonka. Instead, the ball hit Csonka's hip and came loose.

Edwards recovered it on its first bounce as Pisarcik unsuccessfully attempted to fall on it. Kotar, who could have blocked him or fallen on the ball himself, never even saw the fumble, according to Edwards. Once Edwards got it, he sprinted 26 yards untouched into the end zone for a 19–17 Eagles victory. There was stunned silence from the stands and the Giants' sideline. The only noise came from the celebrating Eagles.

===The call===
With Giants victory all but assured, [[NFL on CBS|CBS]] commentator [[Don Criqui]] (working alongside [[Sonny Jurgensen]]) had begun to read the end credits for the game's control truck and on-field personnel shortly before the game's final play:

{{quote|It's Giants football now, third and two. We thank our producer Bob Rowe, our director Jim Silman, and our CBS crew, spotter and statistician John Mara and Tom McHugh here at Giants Stadium. As the clock winds down on the Philadelphia Eagles, a game they thought would project them into a possible wildcard position, it would bring them 7–5 had they won, but a late interception by the Giants will preserve a Giant victory, an upset win as the Giants lead 17–12, we’re inside 30 seconds, the Eagles have no timeouts. [At this point, the snap and fumble take place.] Wait a minute... here's a free football, I don't believe it! The Eagles pick it up and Herman Edwards runs it in for a touchdown! An incredible development!}}

After the game, while showing league highlights, CBS replayed the play. They showed the reaction of both coaches, while [[Brent Musburger]] famously narrated, "A study in contrast!"  According to RJ Bell of Pregame, the point spread of Philadelphia Eagles −2 turned Giants winning bets into pushes.

==The immediate aftermath==
For Edwards, the play was a personal redemption, as he had been burned on one of Pisarcik's early touchdown passes and would have been partially to blame for the loss. It also was his first NFL touchdown. Vermeil refused to question McVay's judgment but allowed that he, too, disliked sitting on the ball to preserve a victory.&lt;ref name="Times game story" /&gt;

Giants fans were enraged. For a football team to lose in that situation was unprecedented. Pisarcik, who belatedly explained to the press, "I never had control,"&lt;ref name="Times game story" /&gt; needed a police escort to get to his car.&lt;ref name="Times next week story" /&gt; During an NFL Network show about famous on-field bloopers, Csonka said that he immediately had Pisarcik join him on a chartered plane trip to South Florida, where they hung out and fished for a few days before returning to New York.

Gibson was fired the next morning.&lt;ref name="Times Gibson firing"&gt;{{cite news|last=Katz|first=Michael|title=Giants Oust Gibson A Day After Bungle|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1978/11/21/archives/giants-oust-gibson-a-day-after-bungle-giants-oust-gibson-a-day.html|newspaper=The New York Times|date=November 21, 1978|accessdate=November 6, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; With angry fans already demanding that someone be held responsible for the debacle, team officials felt he had to go in hopes of saving the season.&lt;ref name=gola20081118&gt;{{cite news|last=Gola|first=Hank|title=30 years later, Giant disappointment of 'The Fumble' still lingers|url=http://www.nydailynews.com/sports/football/giants/30-years-giant-disappointment-fumble-lingers-article-1.335390|newspaper=[[New York Daily News]]|date=November 18, 2008|accessdate=November 6, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; So great was the stigma of having called the play that he never worked in football at any level again. After his firing, Gibson moved to Florida where he subsequently became manager of a local bait shop.&lt;ref name="Gibson after"&gt;{{cite web|last=Daly |first=Buzz |date=November 4, 2005 |url=http://www.eog.com/news/index.aspx?id=957 |title=Mara's Legacy with Giants Recalled |work=Eye on Gambling |accessdate=February 24, 2006 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070928225600/http://www.eog.com/news/index.aspx?id=957 |archivedate=September 28, 2007 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; He never spoke about the play again for the rest of his life.&lt;ref&gt;''ESPN NFL Live'', November 19, 2008, 4:00pm EST, second segment. Gibson was reached by telephone by ESPN and gave the following statement: "I haven't talked about the game for thirty years, and I'm not about to start now."&lt;/ref&gt; In 2008, in a telephone call from ESPN and 30 years after the game, Gibson said: I haven't talked about the game for 30 years, and I'm not about to start now." Gibson died in 2015 at the age of 88.

===Giants fan reaction===
Fans turned on management and ownership as previously grumbled complaints about the team's ineptitude turned into an incessant roar. Their team was now the laughingstock of the league. The Fumble (a term in use before the end of the week) epitomized all the mismanagement and all the talent the team had let get away.

At a demonstration outside the stadium prior to the next home game against the [[Los Angeles Rams]], many fans threw their tickets into a [[bonfire]]. A [[Newark, New Jersey|Newark]] furniture dealer named Morris Spielberg organized a Giants' Fans Committee after running an ad in the ''[[Newark Star-Ledger]]'' that drew hundreds of responses. They met at a hotel near the stadium prior to the team's final home game on December 10 against the [[History of the St. Louis Cardinals (NFL)|St. Louis Cardinals]] and distributed [[flyer (pamphlet)|flyer]]s to pass out to fellow fans during the game. Spielberg had arranged for a [[airplane|plane]] to fly over the stadium with a banner reading "15 Years of Lousy Football — We've Had Enough." When it came, fans were to chant, "We've had enough."

The Giants posted a 17–0 shutout win, but when the plane came (an hour behind schedule), fans showed the victory was not enough to make them forget their recent humiliation. There were more than 24,000 empty seats, yet crowd applause and chants briefly stopped play.

==The rest of the season==
The surprise finish accelerated the directions both teams were taking over the season's final four games. They met in [[Veterans Stadium]] in the final [[regular season]] game.

===Eagles===
Philadelphia was able to extend its win streak to four games the next week, before losing to Dallas and Minnesota. The Eagles managed a season sweep of the Giants with an easy 20–3 victory in the finale to finish 9–7 and snare the second of two wild-card spots available under the playoff format at that time. "One play gets you feeling like you have confidence", Edwards explained years later. "You're not worried about losing anymore; now you're thinking about how you can win."&lt;ref name="25th anniversary"&gt;{{cite news|last=Barber|first=Phil|title=Miracle of Meadowlands Turns 25|url=http://www.nfl.com/news/story/6827118|publisher=National Football League|date=November 12, 2003|accessdate=May 21, 2007|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061214152018/http://www.nfl.com/news/story/6827118|archivedate=December 14, 2006|deadurl=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Eagles lost the [[1978–79 NFL playoffs|playoff game]] to the [[Atlanta Falcons]] because of another failed extra point, in addition to a missed field goal as time expired. But it gave them and their fans something to build on for the next season. Philadelphia corrected its kicking woes by drafting barefoot [[Tony Franklin (placekicker)|Tony Franklin]] from Texas A&amp;M in 1979. As a rookie, Franklin booted a 59-yard field goal on ''[[Monday Night Football]]'' against the [[Dallas Cowboys]] during a 31–21 victory at [[Texas Stadium]].

===Giants===
At first, the Giants tried to look ahead and recover. They vowed to win their remaining four games and protect McVay's job. Instead, the collapse continued. The next week, the Giants blew a 10-point lead over the 3–9 [[Buffalo Bills]] late in the game, giving up 27 points in the fourth quarter to lose 41–17. They would win only one more game the rest of the season, finishing with a 6–10 record. The sweep by Philadelphia ensured the Giants would finish last in the division (tied with the Cardinals) for the third straight season, extending their rut and further angering fans.

==After the season==

===Eagles===
The next year, the Eagles again earned a wild-card spot and then won their first post-merger playoff game over the [[1979 Chicago Bears season|Chicago Bears]] before falling to [[1979 Tampa Bay Buccaneers season|Tampa Bay]]. Following that season, the Giants traded Pisarcik to them for a draft choice. He would finish his career as a backup to [[Ron Jaworski]] five years later. His entire NFL career is usually embodied in that play, and while he is sometimes reluctant to talk about it, he admits that at least people remember his name thanks to it.

The Eagles' momentum carried them further in [[1980 NFL season|the 1980–81 season]], to the division championship, then the conference title and finally to [[Super Bowl XV]], which they lost 27–10 to the [[1980 Oakland Raiders season|Oakland Raiders]] at the [[Mercedes-Benz Superdome|Superdome]] in [[New Orleans]]. "We won the game at the end, and we went on to the playoffs", Edwards said. "The next thing, we're playing in the Super Bowl." He, too, would find that the play defined his career, even though he remained part of the Eagles' lineup for another seven years before going into coaching after a final season split between the Falcons and Rams.

===Giants===
McVay's contract expired and, as expected, was not renewed. He said in 2008 that had the Giants won, the team likely would have won two more games, his contract would have been renewed, "and now I'd be dead with a heart attack."{{r|gola20081118}} McVay never coached again, but went on to a front-office job with the [[San Francisco 49ers]], where he helped develop that team into one of the most dominant of the 1980s. [[Andy Robustelli]], a former All-Pro [[defensive end]] who served as the team's director of operations, was also let go.

Csonka's contract was up as well. Since McVay, with whom he had played in the [[World Football League]]'s [[Memphis Southmen]] before signing with the Giants, was gone and his career was ending, he decided to return to Miami, site of his past glories, for one final season. He would win an [[NFL Comeback Player of the Year]] award before retiring.

Despite widespread calls to hire [[Joe Paterno]] or another successful college coach, the Giants settled on [[Ray Perkins (wide receiver)|Ray Perkins]], then an assistant for the [[History of the San Diego Chargers|San Diego Chargers]], to replace McVay. While Perkins was able to follow the Eagles' lead and build a team that eventually made the playoffs in [[1981 NFL season|1981]], the moves that really made a difference for the Giants drew less attention that off-season.

Wellington Mara had been running football operations himself since joining the organization in the late 1930s, long after most teams had hired a [[general manager]].  He continued to do so even after inheriting the team upon the death of his father, [[Tim Mara|Tim]], in 1958. While he had delegated some of his authority to Robustelli in 1974, he still had the final say in football matters.  However, the fan revolt that erupted in the wake of the Fumble made the Maras realize that they needed to delegate most of the decisions that sorely divided them.  As with many other team matters, they kept arguing over whom to hire as general manager. In the off-season, they called on NFL commissioner [[Pete Rozelle]] to mediate. He suggested [[George Young (football executive)|George Young]], then an executive with the [[Miami Dolphins]], who only took the job after he was granted complete control of the football side of the operation. He proved to be a superb judge of talent, drafting [[Phil Simms]], [[Lawrence Taylor]] and other future Giants stars over the next few seasons.

In 1981, Perkins hired a new defensive coordinator, [[Bill Parcells]], a [[New England Patriots]] assistant who was out of coaching in 1979 after serving as head coach at [[Air Force Falcons football|Air Force]] in 1978. When Perkins resigned after the [[1982 NFL season|1982 season]] to succeed the late [[Bear Bryant]] at the [[University of Alabama]], Parcells took over as head coach. He survived a disastrous first season to lead the talent Young had acquired to two Super Bowl championships, and then find further success with the [[New England Patriots]], Jets and Cowboys before a brief stint as the Dolphins' football operations chief. Parcells is revered today as one of the greatest coaches of the game.

==Legacy==
The Miracle at the Meadowlands has left a lasting impact on the way organized football is played at all levels, not just in the NFL. Most notably, it legitimized the [[quarterback kneel]]. Coaches everywhere took heed of Gibson's fate and immediately began instructing quarterbacks to sit on the ball in similar situations. Some traditionalists feel that the kneel-down has been detrimental to the game and have called for rule changes to eliminate or discourage the play.{{Citation needed|date=January 2008}} Other leagues, such as the [[Arena Football League]], have done just that, and now require the ball to be advanced past the line of scrimmage in order for the clock to continue running in the final minute of play.

[[File:Post-Pisarcik QB kneel formation.svg|250px|left|thumb|Formation used ever since the Fumble/Miracle for quarterback kneel play.]]

===Formation change===
The week after the game, both the Giants and Eagles implemented a new offensive formation to be used only in end-of-game kneeldowns.  It is popularly known as the "Victory Formation" or "Victory Offense".

Not only did the infamous game-losing play make kneeling acceptable, but most of the teams using it changed how it was done. Prior to Pisarcik's fumble, teams had employed standard offensive formations such as an I or a split backfield. The Eagles' unlikely touchdown, however, had made the weakness of doing so glaring. Even though Pisarcik had been trying to hand off instead of kneeling, when he fumbled the snap, there was not only no offensive player there to try to recover it, no one was in position to tackle Edwards and prevent the touchdown either.

At the end of the first half of the Bills game the following week, the Giants debuted the new formation when Pisarcik knelt to preserve their lead. Two running backs stood closely behind Pisarcik while a third (usually a speedy player such as a [[wide receiver]]) was stationed as a sort of safety several yards back.

The Eagles, too, had practiced a similar formation in practice, calling it the Herman Edwards play. Other NFL teams soon followed the lead, and today the formation is standard in college and high school games as well.

===Similar plays===
The play has been recalled often by fans and reporters in later years when a team fumbled away a sure victory late in the game, although it never happened quite as spectacularly as it did that first time.

Probably the most famous play to evoke the Miracle of the Meadowlands, although with a very different outcome, occurred almost three decades later in a [[2005–06 NFL playoffs#AFC: Pittsburgh Steelers 21, Indianapolis Colts 18|2006 Steelers-Colts AFC divisional playoff game]]. As in 1978, an [[Indianapolis Colts|Indianapolis]] turnover on downs had given [[Pittsburgh Steelers|Pittsburgh]] the ball on the Indianapolis 2-yard line and an apparent three-point victory over the heavily favored Colts in the game's final two minutes. However, the Steelers had to keep running the ball, as the Colts still had all their timeouts left. A field goal would have at least required the Colts to score a touchdown (plus kick the extra point) to win the game, while a touchdown would essentially clinch victory, so it was in the Steelers' interest to keep running. A pass would run the risk of being intercepted, or seeing the defense knock the ball out of the quarterback's hand. But on the very first play, running back [[Jerome Bettis]], who had not fumbled all season, had the ball knocked loose by Indianapolis middle linebacker [[Gary Brackett]]. Defensive back [[Nick Harper (American football)|Nick Harper]] recovered the ball and appeared to be on the way to an Edwards-like touchdown, but Pittsburgh quarterback [[Ben Roethlisberger]] managed to tackle Harper near midfield.

Steelers fans and players feared that Bettis was about to end his career with the same ignominy that followed Pisarcik. Several plays later, however, Colts [[placekicker|kicker]] [[Mike Vanderjagt]] wound up the game's [[scapegoat#Scapegoating in sports|goat]], evoking [[Wide Right (Buffalo Bills)|another memorable football moment]] when he missed what would have been the tying field goal, ending what had been a strong season for his team. The Steelers eventually went on to [[Super Bowl XL|a Super Bowl victory that year]], and the play would instead enter NFL lore as "[[Pittsburgh sports lore#The Tackle II|The Tackle II]]".

The play most directly analogous to the Miracle involved a player's, rather than a coach's, questionable decision that cost his team a game. On [[Thanksgiving Day]] [[1993 NFL season|1993]], the Cowboys were playing their customary holiday contest, this time against the visiting Dolphins, in [[Rain and snow mixed|sleet]]. As the clock ticked down, Dallas appeared to have won when it blocked a 41-yard Miami field goal. But as several Dolphins players were gathered around the ball, waiting for it to come to rest in order to down it as close as possible to the Dallas goal, Dallas defensive end [[Leon Lett]] sprinted downfield to try to recover it. He slipped on the slick surface and touched the ball. His touch meant that it became a live ball and Miami was able to recover at the Dallas 1 and kick a field goal for a 16–14 victory.

Lett earned comparisons to Pisarcik and the 1978 Giants since his action was as unnecessary and seemed equally inexplicable. It was fourth down and the ball would have been turned over to Dallas anyway. Coming on the heels of [[Super Bowl XXVII|the previous year's Super Bowl]], when a prematurely celebrating Lett had been stripped on a fourth-quarter fumble return as he was about to score a touchdown, the Thanksgiving gaffe cemented his reputation for unthinking play that overshadowed his entire career.

A near-identical play in a 1999 collegiate game allowed the [[University of Nevada, Las Vegas]] (UNLV) to steal a victory from [[Baylor University|Baylor]]. With the final seconds ticking off the clock, Baylor had a 24–21 lead and possession of the football near the UNLV goal line.  With UNLV out of timeouts, only a kneeldown was necessary. However, instead of trying to run out the clock, Baylor elected to try for a touchdown in an attempt to [[running up the score|run up the final score]]. Baylor running back Darryl Bush fumbled while trying to punch his way into the end zone, and UNLV's Kevin Thomas picked up the loose football and went 99 yards for the game-winning touchdown on the last play of the game.{{citation needed|date=November 2017}}

"The Miracle on the Mountain" is another play with similar circumstances. It took place on October 12, 2002 in a game between the home [[Appalachian State Mountaineers football|Appalachian State Mountaineers]] and visiting [[Furman University|Furman Paladins]] at Kidd Brewer Stadium. A low scoring affair, the Paladins elected to attempt a two-point conversion after scoring the go-ahead touchdown with seven seconds left in the game. Leading 15–14, Furman quarterback Billy Napier's pass was intercepted by Josh Jeffries at the four-yard line. He lateraled the ball to Derrick Black, who returned it for a score, giving the Mountaineers a 16–15 win.

A similar play occurred during a ''[[Monday Night Football]]'' game between the [[Chargers]] and [[Kansas City Chiefs|Chiefs]] on October 31, 2011. Tied 20–20, the Chargers offense marched the ball down the field to the Chiefs' 15-yard line. With one minute left, the Chiefs had no timeouts and the Chargers could run the clock down to the final seconds. Chargers quarterback [[Philip Rivers]] snapped the ball with the intent to simply fall down and to the left, to line up kicker [[Nick Novak]] for the game-winning field goal. However, on the snap, the football jammed into Rivers' ring finger, visibly dislocating it, causing Rivers to fumble the ball.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=soybon|title=Würst Night Ever.|url=http://www.arrowheadpride.com/2011/11/1/2528919/wurst-night-ever|website=[[SB Nation]]|date=November 1, 2011|accessdate=November 2, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Katz|first=Michael|title=ANIMATED: Philip Rivers Fumble Costs Chargers Shot At Win In Regulation|url=https://www.sbnation.com/nfl/2011/11/1/2528786/phillip-rivers-fumble-video-chargers-chiefs|website=SB Nation|date=November 1, 2011|accessdate=November 2, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Chiefs linebacker [[Andy Studebaker]] recovered the fumble in the resulting scrum.

Another occurrence capped [[Kansas State Wildcats football|Kansas State]]'s 38–35 [[comeback (sports)|comeback]] victory November 21, 2015, over [[Iowa State Cyclones football|Iowa State]]. Kansas State had rallied from a 35–14 halftime deficit to pull to within one touchdown. With 1:31 left, Iowa State having possession on first down and the Wildcats having just one time out remaining, the Cyclones chose instead to run the ball before fumbling the ball away; Kansas State would tie the game on the ensuing possession. On Iowa State's next series, starting with 50 seconds remaining, the Cyclones again chose to run a play rather than take a knee and send the game into overtime, but quarterback [[Joel Lanning]] was sacked on second down and lost possession of the ball, ultimately leading to a game-winning field goal by the Wildcats.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Birch|first=Tommy|title=Kansas State stuns error-prone ISU|url=http://www.desmoinesregister.com/story/sports/college/iowa-state/football/2015/11/21/iowa-state-cyclones-kansas-state-wildcats-game-recap/76111140/|newspaper=[[Des Moines Register]]|date=November 21, 2015|accessdate=November 22, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Birch|first=Tommy|title=Status report: Iowa State fumbles away a victory|url=http://www.desmoinesregister.com/story/sports/college/iowa-state/football/2015/11/21/status-report-iowa-state-fumbles-away-victory/76110758/|newspaper=Des Moines Register|date=November 21, 2015|accessdate=November 23, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Iowa State coach [[Paul Rhoads]]' play-calling in the final 90 seconds of the game, the culmination of a difficult 2015 season for ISU, ultimately led to his firing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Peterson|first1=Randy|last2=Birch|first2=Tommy|title=Paul Rhoads fired as Iowa State coach, will coach, will coach finale|url=http://www.desmoinesregister.com/story/sports/college/iowa-state/cyclone-insider/2015/11/22/paul-rhoads-fired-iowa-state-coach/76217264/|newspaper=Des Moines Register|date=November 22, 2015|accessdate=November 22, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On September 23, 1991, in a Monday Night game between the [[1991 New York Jets season|New York Jets]] and the [[1991 Chicago Bears season|Chicago Bears]], the Jets were leading 13–6 and had the ball with two minutes remaining.  With thousands of fans already having given up and headed to the [[Soldier Field]] parking lot, running back [[Blair Thomas]] took a handoff.  Bears defensive tackle [[Steve McMichael]] stopped Thomas cold and then proceeded to wrestle the ball from his grasp, falling on the fumble at the Jets' 36-yard line with 1:54 remaining. On the final play of regulation, [[Jim Harbaugh]] threw a six-yard touchdown pass to [[Neal Anderson]]; Bears kicker [[Kevin Butler (American football)|Kevin Butler]] tied the game with the extra point. In overtime, Harbaugh scored from the one-yard line to clinch the win for Chicago.

On October 23, 2000, the [[2000 New York Jets season|New York Jets]] overcame a 30–7 fourth-quarter deficit in a ''[[Monday Night Football]]'' (MNF) contest against the [[2000 Miami Dolphins season|Miami Dolphins]] to win 40–37 in [[overtime (sports)|overtime]]. It was the greatest comeback in ''MNF'' history, and was later voted the best ''Monday Night Football'' game ever by the show's fans. Jets fans have referred to this game, too, as "The Miracle at the Meadowlands", though it is known throughout the NFL as the [[Monday Night Miracle (American football)|Monday Night Miracle]].

A punt return by [[Brian Westbrook]] of the Eagles with 1:16 left on the clock on October 19, 2003 is occasionally referenced as a "Miracle at the Meadowlands".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.section247sportsblog.com/tag/miracle-at-the-meadowlands-iii/|title=Miracle...Part III.

On December 14, 2008, the [[2008 New York Jets season|New York Jets]] were trailing the [[2008 Buffalo Bills season|Buffalo Bills]] 27–24 with 1:45 left. The Jets had struggled to stop the Bills running game the entire day and the Bills were currently in possession of the ball on their own 20-yard line when Bills quarterback [[J. P. Losman]] ran a [[play action]] option. Jets safety [[Abram Elam]] sacked Losman and caused a fumble, which Jets defensive end [[Shaun Ellis]] picked up and ran for a touchdown to give the Jets a 31–27 victory (on the next Bills possession, Losman was picked off by cornerback [[Darrelle Revis]]). The ''[[New York Post]]'' ran an article the next day referring to the game as the Miracle at the Meadowlands sequel.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.nypost.com/p/sports/jets/item_gpIkHtjK8tYNgIRDgzDUZP|title=Sack, Scoop provide Miracle at Meadowlands Sequel|author=Vaccaro, Mike|journal=New York Post}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The "[[Miracle at the New Meadowlands]]" was played on December 19, 2010.  The Giants were leading the Eagles by a score of 31–10 with 7:28 left in the 4th quarter. The Eagles mounted a comeback by scoring 28 points culminating in a game-winning touchdown as time expired to win 38–31. Giants punter [[Matt Dodge]] kicked to [[DeSean Jackson]] on the final play, which resulted in a 65-yard punt return touchdown, as time expired.{{citation needed|date=November 2017}}

'''Norris''' (dates unknown) was an English [[cricket]]er who played for [[London Cricket Club]] during the 1740s.

==Career==
Norris is mentioned in 1744 and 1745.  On Saturday, 2 June 1744, he played for [[London Cricket Club|London]] against [[Slindon Cricket Club|Slindon]] in the earliest match that has a surviving scorecard.&lt;ref name=GB18&gt;[[G B Buckley]], ''Fresh Light on 18th Century Cricket'', Cotterell, 1935&lt;/ref&gt;  On Wednesday, 26 June 1745, he played for [[Richard Newland (cricketer)|R Newland's XI]] versus [[Robert Colchin|Long Robin's XI]].&lt;ref name=ASW&gt;[[F S Ashley-Cooper]], ''At the Sign of the Wicket: Cricket 1742-1751'', ''Cricket'' Magazine, 1900&lt;/ref&gt;  

As Norris had established his reputation by 1744, he must have been active for some years previously and his career probably began in the 1730s. Very few players were mentioned by name in contemporary reports and there are no other references to Norris.

The '''Palace of Water Sports''' ({{Lang-ru|Дворец водных видов спорта}}; {{lang-tt|Су спорт төрләре сара}}) is an indoor aquatics centre in [[Kazan]], [[Tatarstan]], [[Russia]] which was built for the [[2013 Summer Universiade]]. Located on the banks of the [[Kazanka River]], the competitions in [[Synchronized swimming at the 2013 Summer Universiade|synchronized swimming]], [[Diving at the 2013 Summer Universiade|diving]], [[Swimming at the 2013 Summer Universiade|swimming]] and [[Water polo at the 2013 Summer Universiade|water polo]] took place here. It later hosted the [[Diving at the 2015 World Aquatics Championships|diving events for the 2015 World Aquatics Championships]].

The temporary open arena for water polo with 3,500 was built nearby, using its service and support systems.

==Construction==
The Aquatic Sports Palace was built between September 2009 and October 2012. With an investment of $115 million (€90 million approximately),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sportskeeda.com/swimming/world-aquatics-venue-to-open-friday|title=World Aquatics venue to open Friday|date=9 April 2013|publisher=|accessdate=23 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; the design and construction was awarded by tender to a consortium of British and Russian firms specializing in architecture and engineering: SPEECH Tchoban &amp; Kuznetsov, an architectural and design studio based in Moscow with experience in Russia and Germany, [[Arup Group|Ove Arup]], a British company designers of the [[Beijing National Stadium|Bird's Nest Stadium]] in [[Beijing]] and PSO Kazan ООО, a Russian design and construction company established in the Republic of Tatarstan.&lt;ref&gt;http://eng.tatar-inform.ru/news/tatarstan/2009/09/17/26702/&lt;/ref&gt;

==Technical features==

The '''Port Stakes''' was a [[Flat racing|flat]] [[Horse racing|horse race]] in [[Great Britain]] open to four-year-olds. It was run on the Two Middle Miles (T.M.M.) of the Beacon course at [[Newmarket Racecourse|Newmarket]] over a distance of 2 miles, and was scheduled to take place each year in early or mid April at the Craven meeting. The Two Middle Miles course was relatively flat and was considered less testing then the "Ditch-In" course, over which the similar [[Claret Stakes]] was run.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.nhrm.co.uk/Some_Museum_Treasures/The_Beacon_Post.aspx&lt;/ref&gt;

The race often attracted winners of the previous seasons [[British Classic Races]]: classic winners who went on to win the Port Stakes included [[Whisker (horse)|Whisker]], [[Prince Leopold (horse)|Prince Leopold]], [[Mameluke (horse)|Mameluke]], [[Green Mantle]], [[Priam (horse)|Priam]], [[Galata (horse)|Galata]], [[Grey Momus]], [[Ralph (horse)|Ralph]] and [[Attila (horse)|Attila]].

''' Public Works Department''' was a football club from [[Bhutan]],&lt;ref name="RSSSF1986" /&gt; based at [[Changlimithang Stadium|Changlimithang]], who played in the inaugural [[A-Division (Bhutan)|Bhutan A-Division]], then the top level of football in Bhutan, but since replaced by a full [[Bhutan National League|national league]].&lt;ref name="RSSSF2012"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rsssf.com/tablesb/bhutan2012.html|title=Bhutan 2012|last=Schöggl|first=Hans|last2=Stokkermans|first2=Karel|last3=Jigmi|first3=Sonam|date=28 Feb 2013|website=www.rsssf.com|publisher=[[Rec.Sport.Soccer Statistics Foundation]]|accessdate=27 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
They finished fifth in the [[1986 A-Division (Bhutan)|inaugural]] season,&lt;ref name="RSSSF1986" /&gt; winning three and drawing two of their nine games.&lt;ref name="RSSSF1986" /&gt; They achieved victories over [[Education (Bhutanese football club)|Education]] and [[Yangchengphug College]] 2–1 and 2–0 respectively, whilst drawing with [[Health School]] and [[Motithang College]] 0–0 and [[T.

'''Royal Portrush Golf Club''' is a private [[golf club (institution)|golf club]] in [[County Antrim]], [[Northern Ireland]]. The 36-hole club has two [[links (golf)|links]] [[golf course|courses]], the Dunluce Links (the championship course) and the Valley Links. The former is one of the courses on the Open championship rota and will next host the tournament in 2019.

In [[1951 Open Championship|1951]], Royal Portrush hosted the [[Open Championship]], the oldest of golf's [[Men's major golf championships|major championships]]; the only Open not held on the island of [[Great Britain]]. The Open will return to Portrush in 2019; it hosted the [[Irish Open (golf)|Irish Open]] in [[2012 European Tour|2012]], the first in Northern Ireland since 1953.&lt;ref name=irop&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/golf/18667082 |work=BBC Sport |title=Irish Open: Jamie Donaldson wins at Portrush by four shots |date=1 July 2012 |accessdate=15 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Dunluce Links course is considered to be one of the best courses in the world. It was ranked fourth by ''Golf World'' in their list of "The 100 greatest courses in the British Isles" in November 1996. ''Golf Magazine'' ranked it twelfth in their list of the Top 100 Courses in the World, and ''[[Golf Digest]]'' ranked it as the fourth best course outside the United States in 2007.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine |url=http://www.golfdigest.com/golf-courses/golf-courses/2007-05/100greatestinternational |magazine=Golf Digest |title=100 Best Courses Outside the U.S. |date=28 January 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Location==
Situated on the North Antrim Causeway Coast, Royal Portrush occupies a triangle of giant sand hills with views of the hills of [[Inishowen]] in [[County Donegal]] in the west, the [[Isle of Islay]] and Southern [[Hebrides]] in the north, with the [[Giant's Causeway]] and the [[The Skerries, Northern Ireland|Skerries]] in the east. The course is overlooked by the ruins of the 13th century [[Dunluce Castle]], which gives its name to Dunluce course.

==History==
The Royal Portrush Golf Club was founded {{Time ago|1888}} in 1888 as "The County Club." It became "The Royal County Club" in 1892 under the patronage of the [[George V of the United Kingdom|Duke of York]] and assumed its present name in 1895 under the patronage of the [[Edward VII of the United Kingdom|Prince of Wales]]. In [[1947 Open Championship|1947]], Rathmore Golf Club member [[Fred Daly (golfer)|Fred Daly]] became the first Irishman to win The Open Championship, and [[1951 Open Championship|four years later]] the club hosted the championship itself, the only time the event has been held in Northern Ireland. The club has also hosted the [[Senior British Open Championship]] between 1995 and 1999 and again in 2004.  The club was also host to the 2010 [[Palmer Cup]]. Daly's feat was repeated by club member [[Darren Clarke]] in [[2011 Open Championship|2011]]. Clarke also named Royal Portrush his favourite golf course in the world.

The second course at Royal Portrush is the Valley Links, and is used mostly by members of the 'town' club Rathmore and the ladies and juniors of Royal Portrush. It is shorter and considered less demanding than the Dunluce Links. Rathmore clubhouse and the ladies clubhouse are situated adjacent to the first tee. A nine-hole pitch and putt course, named Skerries, starts from the same location. There is also a driving range at the club.

==Rathmore Golf Club==
The Valley Links is the home of Rathmore Golf Club whose clubhouse is situated near the first tee. Famous members include 1947 Open Champion [[Fred Daly (golfer)|Fred Daly]] and 2010 U.S. Open champion [[Graeme McDowell]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.rathmoregolfclub.co.uk |publisher=Rathmore Golf Club |title=Club History |accessdate=20 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Signature holes==
On the Dunluce course at Portrush there are several signature holes on both the front and back nine. In particular are the fourth, fifth and sixteenth holes. The fourth hole is a long par four which is more than 480 yards from the championship tees, with out of bounds right and thick rough on the left. There are several bunkers in the undulating fairway and the green is placed between two small sand hills. The fifth hole is a relatively short downhill par four with a dogleg to the right. It has no bunkers but a heavily undulating green perched on the edge of a large drop down to the beach and has views across the White Rocks beach, and the [[Dunluce Castle]] after which the course was named. The sixteenth hole, named Calamity Corner, but locally known as just "Calamity" is a long 236 yard, uphill par three. It is played to a green over a huge ravine short and right, with mounds and hollows to the back and left of the green.

==The Open Championship==
[[The Open Championship]] was staged at Royal Portrush only once, in [[1951 Open Championship|1951]]; [[Max Faulkner]] won his sole [[Men's major golf championships|major championship]]. The Open is scheduled to return to Portrush {{nowrap|in July [[2019 Open Championship|2019]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Open Championship to be staged at Royal Portrush in 2019 |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/golf/34576139 |work=BBC Sport |date=20 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

A number of course changes are being made in preparation for the 2019 Open. The 17th and 18th holes of the current Dunluce Links, the Championship course, are to be replaced by two new holes (the 7th and 8th) on land that is currently part of the Valley Links. Holes 7 to 16 will then be holes 9 to 18 on the redesigned course. The land freed-up by removing the 17th and 18th will be used for the tented village. There will be a number of other changes, including lengthening the 2nd hole by {{convert|40|yd}} and realigning the 10th (the new 12th). While the par of the course will remain at 72, the overall length will increase by almost {{convert|200|yd}} to {{convert|7337|yd}}. The total number of bunkers will increase from 59 to 62. Since the Valley Links is losing two holes to the Dunluce Links, a number of changes are also having to be made to that course.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.theopen.com/News/News/2015/10/Royal-Portrush-to-host-The-148th-Open-in-2019 |publisher=theopen.com |title=Royal Portrush to host The 148th Open in 2019 |date=20 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Serbia Open''' ({{lang-sr|Отворено првенство Србије}}, {{lang|sr-Latn|Otvoreno prvenstvo Srbije}}) was an [[Association of Tennis Professionals|ATP]] [[ATP World Tour 250 series|World Tour 250 series]] men's tennis tournament held in [[Belgrade, Serbia]] and played on outdoor [[clay court]]s. The event was held for the first time in [[2009 ATP World Tour|2009]], from May 4–10.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.atpworldtour.com/1/en/news/newsarticle_1612.asp ATP World Tour To Feature New Belgrade Tournament In 2009]&lt;/ref&gt; It was the first for [[Serbia]], as the country never before hosted an [[Association of Tennis Professionals]] or a [[Women's Tennis Association]] tournament.

[[Andreas Seppi]] was the event's last singles champion, having won the tournament in 2012.

The tournament was owned and run by the family of [[Novak Djokovic]], who through their company Family Sport purchased the ATP Tour date from the organizers of the [[Dutch Open (tennis)|Dutch Open]] in 2008, then arranged with the local city of Belgrade authorities for the plot of land where the venue was built, and convinced the [[Cabinet of Serbia (2008–2012)|Serbian government]] under prime minister [[Mirko Cvetković]] to support the event through state-owned enterprises, primarily [[Telekom Srbija]]. At the time of their purchase in 2008, Djokovic was the #3 player in the world having won his first Grand Slam title earlier that year.

Djokovic's uncle Goran was the tournament director from its inception,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/sport/tennis/article6217593.ece |title=The Net Post: Novak Djoković is glowing with pride at hosting his own tournament |first=Neil |last=Harman |publisher=''[[The Times]]'' |date=2009-05-04 |accessdate=2009-05-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; until he resigned the post in late May 2012,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.novosti.rs/vesti/sport.296.html:380973-Srbija-open-pred-gasenjem Srbija open pred gašenjem?];''Večernje novosti'', 22 May 2012&lt;/ref&gt; a month after the tournament's 2012 edition. Djokovic won the tournament twice, in 2009. and 2011.

In 2013, Serbia Open was replaced on the ATP schedule by the newly established [[Power Horse Cup]] in [[Düsseldorf]].

'''Toppsy Curvey''' (born '''Laurie Stathopoulous''' December 9, 1959 in [[Boston, Massachusetts]]) is a former big-bust feature dancer and pornographic video actress in the United States. Toppsy was a feature dancer in the late 1980s and by 1994 she began a brief soft-core pornographic video career. Toppsy is also the younger sister of fellow big-bust feature dancer and one-time porn actress [[Lulu Devine]].

==Television appearances==
Toppsy has made appearances on talk shows such as ''[[The Jerry Springer Show]]'', ''[[The Jenny Jones Show]]'' and ''The [[Sally Jessy Raphael]] Show''. She was once hired as a spokesmodel for the [[Howard Stern Show]] but walked off after engaging in a verbal battle with comedian [[Judy Tenuta]]. She has also appeared in such men's magazines as ''Score'', ''Gent'', ''Hustler's Busty Beauties'', and ''D-Cup Magazine''.

=="Bandito" sports game crashing runs==
In the Tampa area, Toppsy's sister Lulu is known in local sports circles for her "Kissing Bandit" routine, made famous by former "Kissing Bandit", TV personality, big-bust model and three-time [[Playboy]] centrefold [[Morganna Roberts]]. Toppsy accompanied her sister numerous times on "bandito" runs, as she and her sister Lulu ran out on the fields during [[Tampa Bay Rays]] baseball and [[Tampa Bay Buccaneers]] football games to kiss players.

Curvey has also made appearances during other major league baseball games. On July 28, 1991, she planted a kiss on pitcher [[Scott Kamieniecki]] at Yankee Stadium.&lt;ref name="Kiss Angels"&gt;{{cite news |date= 1991-07-29 |title= Kiss, Angels Drop Yankees |first= Howard |last= Blatt |newspaper= [[Syracuse Herald Journal]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Newsday 1991-08-22"&gt;{{cite news |date= 1991-08-22 |title= Sid Breaks Skid Strong effort in nightcap ends it at 11|first= Joe |last= Donnelly|newspaper= [[Newsday]]|url= https://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/newsday/access/102689238.html?dids=102689238:102689238&amp;FMT=ABS&amp;FMTS=ABS:FT&amp;type=current&amp;date=Aug+22%2C+1991&amp;author=By+Joe+Donnelly.+STAFF+WRITER&amp;pub=Newsday+%28Combined+editions%29&amp;desc=Sid+Breaks+Skid+Strong+effort+in+nightcap+ends+it+at+11&amp;pqatl=google}}&lt;/ref&gt; In August 1991, at a [[New York Mets|Mets]] game, she visited pitcher [[David Cone]] on the mound during the second inning.&lt;ref name="Newsday 1991-08-22"/&gt; This event not only made news, but was also included in ''Sports and Courts'' by Frederick J. Day and ''You Be the Umpire! The Baseball Controversy Quiz Book'' by [[Richard Goldstein (writer born 1942)|Richard Goldstein]]. Both these publications stated Curvey's name as Laurie Stathopoulos.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1= Day|first1= Frederick J.  |title= Sports and Courts |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=Zyk7trXOvUUC&amp;pg=PA21&amp;dq=%22Toppsy+Curvey%22+%22Stathopoulos%22+-inpublisher:icon&amp;as_brr=0&amp;cd=1#v=onepage&amp;q=%22Toppsy%20Curvey%22%20%22Stathopoulos%22%20-inpublisher%3Aicon&amp;f=false  |accessdate= 2010-05-28 |year= 2005 |publisher= iUniverse|location= |language= |isbn= 0-595-79083-6|page= 21 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1= Goldstein |first1= Richard |title= You Be the Umpire!

==Later career==
As of 2011, Stathopolous was the owner of Crow Haven Corner, a "witch shop" in [[Salem, Massachusetts]], and performs psychic readings there.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2011/05/27/us/27psychic.html?_r=4&amp;hp|title=Witchy Town’s Worry: Do Too Many Psychics Spoil the Brew?|publisher=[[New York Times]]|date=May 26, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ''New York Times'' and the store's website&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.crowhavencorner.net/aboutus.html|title=Crow Haven Corner: About Us|accessdate=2011-05-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; both give her first name as "Lorelei".

'''Tumbling''', also known as '''power tumbling''', is a gymnastics sporting discipline which combines skills of [[artistic gymnastics]] with those of [[trampolining]]. It is sometimes practiced on a 25-meter-long spring track. Tumbling, which originated for entertainment purposes, is now codified, regulated, judged, and performed using standardized special acrobatic equipment.

Competitors, both male and female, perform two passes, each containing eight skills, along the track.  Passes usually begin with a Round-off, Barani or Rudi (the Barani and Rudi are forward, twisting [[somersaults]]) which is followed by a series of back-handsprings and/or whips (a fast, long back somersault done in a straight body position) ending in a 'dismount' skill. In competition, only feet and hands are allowed to make contact with the track.

Governed by rules established by the [[Fédération Internationale de Gymnastique]], tumbling is one of the [[gymnastic]] disciplines.  Elements of tumbling are also practiced on [[Floor (gymnastics)|floor exercise]] by participants of both women's and men's artistic gymnastics. Tumbling elements, such as the round-off and [[back-handspring]] (flip), are commonly integrated into the [[balance beam]] routines of gymnasts.

Tumbling has been an Olympic event only once, at the [[Gymnastics at the 1932 Summer Olympics|1932 Summer Olympics]], and was a demonstration event in [[Gymnastics at the 1996 Summer Olympics|1996]] and [[Gymnastics at the 2000 Summer Olympics|2000]]. However, it is one of the events of the [[World Games]] and is an annual World Championships event held in conjunction with the [[Trampoline World Championships]].

==Equipment==
When power tumbling was first started, and for the first ever US NatiFrom there, "floors" evolved in a wide variety of ways, including rows of skis tied together with the ends cut off under those mats, and then to the rod floor used today. This was&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last = Bertz|first =Jim|title =Through The Years: How the Competitive Tumbling Floor Evolved|url = http://www.acrobaticsports.com/detail.do?noArticle=1705&amp;noCat=274&amp;id_key=274| accessdate = 20 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; developed by Randy Mulkey, which is a {{convert|25|m|ft}} long by {{convert|2|m|ft|sing=on}} wide track consisting of fiberglass rods (laid horizontally, to make it springy) under two layers of foam mats.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last = Ross|first = Athletic Supply| title = Competition Equipment| url = http://www.rossathletic.com/power-tumbling-equipment.htm| accessdate = 20 October 2007 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20071013062554/http://www.rossathletic.com/power-tumbling-equipment.htm &lt;!-- Bot retrieved archive --&gt; |archivedate = 13 October 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Apparatus Norms|year=2009|url=http://www.fig-gymnastics.com/vsite/vnavsite/page/directory/0,10853,5187-188050-205272-nav-list,00.html|author=FIG|pages=83–84|chapter=Part II|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110514040525/http://www.fig-gymnastics.com/vsite/vnavsite/page/directory/0,10853,5187-188050-205272-nav-list,00.html|archivedate=14 May 2011|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; It also includes a {{convert|10|m|ft}} run up at the front. At the end is a mat where the gymnasts land their dismounting skill.

==Competition==
Competitors perform two passes, each containing eight skills along the track, usually starting with a round-off, barani, or rudi (the barani and rudi are forward, twisting somersaults) followed by a series of back-handsprings and/or whips (a fast, long back somersault done in a straight body position) ending in a 'dismount' skill. In the lower levels, there are rules about what each pass should contain. At more advanced levels there is a choice about the skills performed. This includes adding much more difficulty to the passes by adding twisting somersaults (called single, double or triple fulls) in the middle of the pass. The dismounting skill is often another double or triple full or a double or triple back somersault, which can also include extra twists. Internationally, competitors frequently have three double somersaults incorporated into each pass. All athletes in this sport at high levels are expected to have a finals pass as well as their other two passes. While not used at every competition, it is important to have three passes.

Scoring is similar to [[trampolining]] with five judged scores for execution (form, body position and final landing) and one for the [[degree of difficulty]] (number of [[somersault]]s and twists etc.). The top and bottom execution scores are dropped and the remaining three added to the difficulty score to give the total for the pass.

==Basic tumbling moves==
* Punch fronts
* Back handsprings
* [[Roundoff]]s
* Roundoff back handsprings
* [[Layout (gymnastics)#L|Layouts]]
* Front fulls
* [[Double fulls]]
* Standing fulls
* Baranis
* Whips
* Double backs
* Tucks
*front walkover
*front handspring
