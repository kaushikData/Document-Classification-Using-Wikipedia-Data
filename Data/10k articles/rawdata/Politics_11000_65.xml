{{Politics of Côte d'Ivoire}}
The '''2010–11 Ivorian crisis''' was a political crisis in [[Ivory Coast]] which began after [[Laurent Gbagbo]], the [[List of heads of state of Ivory Coast|President of Ivory Coast]] since 2000, was proclaimed the winner of the [[Ivorian presidential election, 2010|Ivorian election of 2010]], the first election in the country in 10 years. The opposition candidate, [[Alassane Ouattara]], and a number of countries, organisations and leaders worldwide claimed Ouattara had won the election. After months of attempted negotiation and sporadic violence, the crisis entered a decisive stage as Ouattara's forces [[Second Ivorian Civil War|began a military offensive]] in which they quickly gained control of most of the country and besieged key targets in [[Abidjan]], the country's largest city. International organizations have reported numerous human rights violations, and the UN undertook its own military action with the stated objective to protect itself and civilians.

A significant step in bringing an end to the crisis occurred on 11 April 2011 upon the capture and arrest of Gbagbo in Abidjan by pro-Ouattara forces backed by French forces.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.voanews.com/english/news/africa/UN-Ivory-Coast-Crisis-Not-Over-Yet-119617614.html|title=UN: Ivory Coast Crisis Not Over Yet|publisher=VOA news|date=11 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Announcement of results and post-election conflict==
On 2 December 2010, [[Youssouf Bakayoko]], head of the Ivorian Commission Electorale Indépendante (CEI), announced provisional results showing that Alassane Ouattara had won the [[Ivorian presidential election, 2010|Ivorian election of 2010]] in the second round with 54.1% of the vote, against 45.9% for Laurent Gbagbo; he reported that turnout was 81.09%. Results had been expected and then postponed for days, beyond the deadline, and Bakayoko's appearance to announce the results—at an Abidjan hotel heavily guarded by the UN—took the press by surprise.&lt;ref&gt;David Lewis and Loucoumane Coulibaly, [https://af.reuters.com/article/worldNews/idAFTRE6B13FN20101202 "Ivory Coast's Ouattara wins vote - election chief"], Reuters, 2 December 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; Bakayoko reportedly chose to announce the results at the hotel, which Ouattara had been using as "his base", because he wanted to have the security of UN protection when doing so.&lt;ref name = Seals&gt;David Lewis and Tim Cocks, [https://af.reuters.com/article/commoditiesNews/idAFLDE6B10GL20101202?sp=true "Ivory Coast seals borders after opposition win"], Reuters, 2 December 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; {{Citation needed span|text=According to the 2003 Peace Accords signed in the suburbs of Paris, the majority of the CEI must consist of politicians of the opposition ([[Democratic Party of Côte d'Ivoire – African Democratic Rally]] and [[Rally of the Republicans]]).|date=March 2011}}

[[Paul Yao N'Dre]], the President of the [[Constitutional Council (Ivory Coast)|Constitutional Council]] (a body that was viewed by the opposition as favoring Gbagbo, because N'Dre was considered an ally of the President), then took to the airwaves to say that the CEI had no authority left to announce any results, because it had already missed its deadline to announce them, and consequently the results were invalid.&lt;ref name=Seals/&gt;&lt;ref name=Koffi&gt;Christophe Koffi, [https://www.google.com/hostednews/afp/article/ALeqM5iedxpbLd4aBzQjdcFHeD-LdVH2qA?docId=CNG.347958328eebaf1a5122e531750726d6.c81 "Ouattara named winner of I. Coast election"], AFP, 2 December 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; According to N'Dre, the passing of the deadline meant that only the Constitutional Council was "authorised to announce decisions on the contested results." It was widely presumed that the Court would issue a ruling favoring Gbagbo, although the CEI's results indicated that Gbagbo could only be credited with victory if hundreds of thousands of votes were invalidated.&lt;ref name=Seals/&gt;

At the heart of the dispute lies article 94 of the Constitution of Côte d'Ivoire, which reads:

&lt;blockquote&gt;The Constitutional Council shall control the regularity of the operations of the referendum and proclaims the results.

The Council shall decide on:
: - the eligibility of the candidates to the presidential and legislative elections;
: - the disputes concerning the election of the President of the Republic and of the Deputies.
The Constitutional Council shall proclaim the final results of the presidential elections.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://abidjan.usembassy.gov/ivoirian_constitution2.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-10-26 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111015163707/http://abidjan.usembassy.gov/ivoirian_constitution2.html |archivedate=15 October 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Shortly after the announcements, the military sealed the country's borders.&lt;ref name=Seals/&gt;

===Double victory claims===
On 3 December, the Constitutional Council declared Gbagbo winner.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-africa-11913832|title=Ivory Coast poll overturned: Gbagbo declared winner|publisher=BBC news|date=3 December 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; N'Dre announced that the results in seven northern regions were cancelled, and on that basis declaring the outcome narrowly in favor of Gbagbo, who was credited with 51.45% of the vote while Ouattara had 48.55%.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.google.com/hostednews/afp/article/ALeqM5h1lqqW8eecnVcdL82ggEDWQRli0Q?docId=CNG.a5fc0e83efff72426ce88ff122d81b07.751 "Constitutional body names Gbagbo I. Coast election winner"], AFP, 3 December 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

On the basis of the CEI's results, Ouattara maintained that he was "the elected President" and said that the Constitutional Council had "abused its authority, the whole world knows it, and I am sorry for my country's image".&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-africa-11917359 "World leaders back Ouattara as Ivory Coast poll winner"], BBC News, 3 December 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; He had the clear backing of the international and regional community for his claim to victory, but top officers in the military appeared to stand firmly behind Gbagbo.&lt;ref&gt;Tim Cocks and Loucoumane Coulibaly, [https://www.reuters.com/article/idUSTRE6B04V920101204 Ivory Coast's Gbagbo sworn in despite poll row], Reuters, 4 December 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Forces Nouvelles de Côte d'Ivoire|New Forces]] and Prime Minister [[Guillaume Soro]] both supported Ouattara's claim to victory;&lt;ref name=Despite&gt;Tim Cocks and Loucoumane Coulibaly, [https://af.reuters.com/article/topNews/idAFJOE6B309G20101204?sp=true "Ivory Coast's Gbagbo sworn in despite poll row"], Reuters, 4 December 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; Soro said that he considered Ouattara the rightful President and offered his resignation to Gbagbo on 4 December.&lt;ref&gt;Roland Lloyd Parry, [https://www.google.com/hostednews/afp/article/ALeqM5gjK2yBAXISojkSoJZIWKs4SKJlDA?docId=CNG.eb6f793d7e091dc5315bb6b6cbcea713.c41 "Defiant Gbagbo sworn in as I. Coast president"], AFP, 3 December 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;!-- Supports to Gbagbo --&gt;
Gbagbo was sworn in for another five-year term on 4 December, defiantly declaring: "I will continue to work with all the countries of the world, but I will never give up our sovereignty." Sporadic violence and gunfire were reported in various parts of the country, including Abidjan.&lt;ref name=Despite/&gt;  Gbagbo appointed a new Prime Minister, [[Gilbert Aké]], on 5 December; Aké, an economist and university president, was already regarded as close to Gbagbo.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.google.com/hostednews/afp/article/ALeqM5gPb3Fl6cGpCbkGUjYIL9H9GuarQA?docId=CNG.468208a520b81057a0741e32037e7230.811 "Côte d'Ivoire: Laurent Gbagbo nomme à son tour son Premier ministre"], AFP, 5 December 2010 {{fr icon}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Ouattara himself was sworn in separately shortly after, saying that "Ivory Coast is now in good hands". Ouattara then re-appointed Soro as his prime minister.&lt;ref name="mediate-mbeki"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-africa-11920739|title=Thabo Mbeki to mediate in Ivory Coast president crisis|accessdate=5 December 2010|publisher=BBC News|date=5 December 2010| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20101205043235/http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-africa-11920739| archivedate= 5 December 2010 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====United Nations====
On 18 December, a United Nations spokesperson said in response to a Gbagbo demand that foreign armed troops leave the country that the UN did not consider Gbagbo to be the president, and that peacekeepers would continue to support and protect both Alassane Ouattara and Ivorian citizens.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.voanews.com/english/news/UN-Spokesman-Gbagbo-Not-Ivory-Coast-President-112131814.html | title=UN Spokesman: Gbagbo Not Ivory Coast President | accessdate=8 January 2010 | date=18 December 2010 | publisher=Voice of America}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 23 December 2010, the [[United Nations Human Rights Council]] passed a resolution that "strongly condemned human rights violations that had taken place in Côte d'Ivoire...that occurred in different parts of Côte d'Ivoire in relation to the conclusion of the 2010 presidential election."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.ohchr.org/EN/NewsEvents/Pages/DisplayNews.aspx?NewsID=10615&amp;LangID=E | title=Special session of Human Rights Council on Côte d'Ivoire concludes after adopting a resolution calling for end to all human rights violations | accessdate=8 January 2011 | date=23 December 2010 | publisher=United Nations Human Rights Council}}&lt;/ref&gt; The resolution was criticized by [[Amnesty International]] as having insufficiently addressed the situation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.amnesty.org.uk/news_details.asp?NewsID=19160 | title=Ivory Coast: 'Disappointment' at UN's response to worsening situation | accessdate=8 January 2011 | date=24 December 2010 | publisher=Amnesty International}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 5 December, former President Thabo Mbeki held separate talks with Gbagbo and Ouattara, acting as a mediator. The African Union had appointed Mbeki to lead an emergency mission to Côte d'Ivoire "to facilitate the rapid and peaceful conclusion of the electoral process and the efforts to find a way out of the crisis."&lt;ref&gt;Olivier Monnier and Pauline Bax.

[[Gabon]]ese opposition leader [[André Mba Obame]] cited the events in Ivory Coast and the international recognition of Ouattara as Ivorian President as inspiration for declaring himself winner of the controversial [[Gabonese presidential election, 2009|2009 Gabonese presidential election]], sparking an ongoing political crisis in Gabon.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Gualbert |first=Phal |url=https://www.reuters.com/article/2011/01/27/us-gabon-protest-idUSTRE70Q42C20110127 |title=Gabon police tear gas protesters, tensions rise |publisher=Reuters |date= 27 January 2011|accessdate=18 March 2011| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20110207230341/https://www.reuters.com/article/2011/01/27/us-gabon-protest-idUSTRE70Q42C20110127| archivedate= 7 February 2011 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 28 December, presidents [[Yayi Boni]] of [[Benin]], [[Ernest Bai Koroma]] of [[Sierra Leone]] and [[Pedro Pires]] of [[Cape Verde]] arrived in the country on behalf of ECOWAS, to convince Gbagbo to resign and go into exile for the sake of his country, while declaring it was Gbagbo's last chance before the deployment of military force against him.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Eric Agnero |url=http://edition.cnn.com/2010/WORLD/africa/12/28/ivory.coast.conflict/ |title=African leaders arrive in Ivory Coast to deal with political crisis |publisher=CNN |date=28 December 2010 |accessdate=28 December 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=SME |language=Slovak |url=http://www.sme.sk/c/5697255/prezidenti-skusia-predist-invazii-do-pobrezia-slonoviny.html |title=Prezidenti skúsia predísť invázii do Pobrežia Slonoviny |publisher=SITA |date= |accessdate=26 December 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 20 December, [[White House Press Secretary]] [[Robert Gibbs]] told a news briefing that it was "time for [Gbagbo] to go" and that "We stand ready to impose targeted sanctions, individually and in concert with our partners around the world, on President Gbagbo, on his immediate family, on those who are associated with him and those who continue to cling to power illegitimately."&lt;ref&gt;"[https://www.reuters.com/article/idUSTRE6BJ4PE20101220 White House: It's time for Gbagbo to go]," Reuters, 20 December 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; On 21 December, the [[United States Department of State]] announced that it had imposed travel sanctions against Gbagbo and 30 allies. William Fitzgerald, the [[Assistant Secretary of State for African Affairs|deputy assistant secretary for African affairs]], said that trade sanctions may be imposed against individuals. On 22 December, State Department spokesman [[Philip J. Crowley]] said that Ouattara's victory was irrefutable and reiterated U.S. demands that Gbagbo step down.&lt;ref&gt;Indira A.R.

==Threats, violence and human rights violations==
Between December 2010 and March 2011, there was a series of sporadic outbreaks of violence between Gbagbo's militias and security forces and Ouattara's supporters, primarily in the city of Abidjan where both sides had large numbers of supporters. On 16 December 2010, clashes between opposition supporters and security forces in Abidjan and [[Yamoussoukro]] left 44 people dead.&lt;ref name=autogenerated4&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.africanews.com/site/list_message/32393 |title=Two rebel soldiers killed in Ivory Coast |publisher=AfricaNews |date=16 December 2010 |accessdate=31 December 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120329061319/http://www.africanews.com/site/list_message/32393 |archivedate=29 March 2012 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.businessweek.com/news/2010-12-16/ivory-coast-opposition-says-32-supporters-killed.html |title=Ivory Coast Opposition Says 32 Supporters Killed |work=BusinessWeek |date=16 December 2010 |accessdate=31 December 2010 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101230192446/http://www.businessweek.com/news/2010-12-16/ivory-coast-opposition-says-32-supporters-killed.html |archivedate=30 December 2010 |deadurl=yes |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.boston.com/news/world/africa/articles/2010/12/16/ivory_coast_march_over_vote_turns_violent_3_dead/ |title=At least 20 killed in Ivory Coast clashes |work=Boston Globe  |date= 16 December 2010|accessdate=18 February 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was alleged that mass grave of opposition supporters had been dug in a pro-Gbagbo neighborhood in Abidjan, but security forces prevented UN investigators from going to the site to check the allegations.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.npr.org/2010/12/30/132496976/u-n-mass-grave-probe-obstructed-in-ivory-coast UN Mass Grave Probe Obstructed In Ivory Coast: NPR] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110106065401/http://www.npr.org/2010/12/30/132496976/u-n-mass-grave-probe-obstructed-in-ivory-coast |date=6 January 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Another mass grave was reported to exist in the village of N'Dotre, guarded by government militias.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|author=The Associated Press |url=http://www.cbc.ca/world/story/2010/12/24/ivory-coast-state-tv.html |title=CBC News - World - Ivory Coast mass grave feared: UN |publisher=Cbc.ca |date=24 December 2010 |accessdate=18 February 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As the violence continued in Abidjan, heavy fighting broke out in western Côte d'Ivoire at the end of February 2011 as the newly renamed [[Republican Forces of Côte d'Ivoire]] (RFCI) sought to close the border with [[Liberia]], from where Gbagbo was reported to have recruited numerous fighters. A series of western towns fell to the RFCI between 25 February and 21 March as it advanced beyond the ceasefire line from the previous civil war. On 28 March the RFCI launched a country-wide military offensive as Ouattara declared that all peaceful solutions had been "exhausted". After heavy fighting in some central Ivorian towns, the RFCI advanced rapidly across the country to seize towns along the eastern border with Ghana,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title=Key Ivory Coast towns fall as Gbagbo calls for ceasefire |url=http://www.rnw.nl/africa/bulletin/pro-ouattara-forces-seize-another-ivory-coast-town-1 |date=29 March 2011 |publisher=Reuters |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120930103518/http://www.rnw.nl/africa/bulletin/pro-ouattara-forces-seize-another-ivory-coast-town-1 |archivedate=30 September 2012 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; the political capital [[Yamoussoukro]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://af.reuters.com/article/topNews/idAFJOE72T0NY20110330?pageNumber=2&amp;virtualBrandChannel=0|title=Pro-Ouattara forces reach Ivorian capital|date=30 March 2011|publisher=Reuters}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the key port of [[San Pédro, Côte d'Ivoire|San Pédro]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.rnw.nl/english/bulletin/i-coast-cocoa-town-under-pro-ouattara-forces|title=I.

===Status of Gbagbo and Ouattara===
On 18 December 2010, Gbagbo ordered peacekeeping forces from the United Nations and France to leave the country; the government issued a statement saying that it " demands the departure of the [[United Nations Operation in Côte d'Ivoire]] and [[Operation Unicorn]] forces in Ivory Coast and is opposed to any renewal of their mandate."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://en.wikinews.org/wiki/UN_convoy_attacked_by_gunman_in_Ivory_Coast_as_peacekeeping_forces_ordered_to_leave_country |title=UN convoy attacked by gunman in Ivory Coast as peacekeeping forces ordered to leave country |accessdate=8 January 2011 |date=18 December 2010 |publisher=Wikinews |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101221072502/http://en.wikinews.org/wiki/UN_convoy_attacked_by_gunman_in_Ivory_Coast_as_peacekeeping_forces_ordered_to_leave_country |archivedate=21 December 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In January 2011, Gbagbo requested a recount of the votes, along with the creation of a committee composed of international members that would oversee the recount.&lt;ref name="xinhua7jan"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://news.xinhuanet.com/english2010/indepth/2011-01/07/c_13680942.htm | title=Cote d'Ivoir's Gbagbo goes on diplomatic offensive | accessdate=8 January 2011 | date=7 January 2011 | publisher=Xinhua}}&lt;/ref&gt;  He also engaged in a diplomatic campaign to gain support from countries like [[Zimbabwe]], while at the same time expelling ambassadors from the United Kingdom and [[Canada]], countries that did not recognize his leadership.&lt;ref name="xinhua7jan"/&gt;&lt;ref name="wn7jan"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://en.wikinews.org/wiki/Ivory_Coast_expels_British,_Canadian_ambassadors |title=Ivory Coast expels British, Canadian ambassadors |accessdate=8 January 2011 |date=7 January 2011 |publisher=Wikinews |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110110054305/http://en.wikinews.org/wiki/Ivory_Coast_expels_British%2C_Canadian_ambassadors |archivedate=10 January 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; After the election, Gbagbo initially retained control of the country's armed forces and the state media,&lt;ref name="wn7jan"/&gt; but in part due to the international sanctions which limited Gbagbo's financing abilities, this control gradually crumbled and the offensive by Ouattara forces caused much of Gbagbo's armed forces to defect.&lt;ref name="csm-defect"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.csmonitor.com/World/Africa/Africa-Monitor/2011/0331/In-Ivory-Coast-Gbagbo-s-forces-defect-en-masse-reports|date=31 March 2011|place=Dakar, Senegal|author=Drew Hinshaw|title=In Ivory Coast, Gbagbo's forces defect en masse: reports}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ouattara was at the first floor of the Golf Hotel in Abidjan while Gbagbo remained at the presidential palace. The hotel was guarded by about 800 UN peacekeepers, who had encircled the site with [[Barbed tape|coiled razor wire]] and guarded the premises with white UN [[armored personnel carrier]]s and security checks for visitors.&lt;ref name="autogenerated2"&gt;{{Cite news |author=AP / RUKMINI CALLIMACHI Sunday, 12 December 2010 |url=http://www.time.com/time/world/article/0,8599,2036621,00.html |title=Alassane Ouattara Governs Ivory Coast from Hotel |work=TIME |date=12 December 2010 |accessdate=23 December 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101216174313/http://www.time.com/time/world/article/0,8599,2036621,00.html |archive-date=16 December 2010 |dead-url=yes |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to local UN mission chief Choi Young-jin, troops loyal to Gbagbo (about 3,000 militiamen according to an Ouattara spokesman&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bangkokpost.com/breakingnews/212675/ivory-coast-ouattara-camp-urges-force-to-oust-gbagbo |title=Ivory Coast in political violence |publisher=Bangkok Post |date= |accessdate=23 December 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;) occupied the neighborhood surrounding the Golf Hotel and set up a [[blockade]] that prevented UN trucks from bringing food, water and medicine to the hotel; UN trucks were sent each day but had been turned back every time. Ouattara had a [[pirate radio]] station inside the hotel that broadcast campaign songs, speeches from Ouattara, and statements by his spokesman. However, technicians working for Gbagbo had [[Radio jamming|jammed the signal]] and so as to change [[Radio frequency|frequencies]] several times a day.&lt;ref name="autogenerated2"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|author=Canada |url=https://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/world/africa-mideast/ivorian-president-elect-confined-to-hotel/article1846161/ |title=Ivorian president-elect confined to hotel |work=The Globe and Mail |date= |accessdate=23 December 2010 |location=Toronto| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20101223060247/http://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/world/africa-mideast/ivorian-president-elect-confined-to-hotel/article1846161/| archivedate= 23 December 2010 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During early March 2011, Ouattara traveled to Ethiopia to meet with an African Union (AU) council tasked with finding a solution to the conflict.&lt;ref name="bbc10march"/&gt; Gbagbo refused to attend the meeting, which resulted in the AU confirming Ouattara as the victor in the elections.&lt;ref name="bbc10march"/&gt; It was the first time he had left the Golf Hotel since the election was held.&lt;ref name="bbc10march"/&gt;

Reports suggested a cash crisis in the country due to a lack of capital inflows and runs on banks forcing national financial institutions to also deplete their reserves. Several banks ceased operations in the country. The move led to Gbagbo loyalist forces to have "nationalised" those banks and "requisitioned" cash from the Central Bank's Abidjan bureau.

==After the fall of Gbagbo==

===Human rights===
Human rights remained as an issue. In May 2011, Amnesty International reported that both pro-Gbagbo and pro-Ouattara sides had committed [[war crimes]] and [[crimes against humanity]] in the conflict. On 20 July 2011, Ouattara inaugurated a commission to investigate the violation of human rights during the conflict.&lt;ref name="France Soir chronologie"&gt;http://www.francesoir.fr/actualite/international/cote-d-ivoire-chronologie-des-evenements-depuis-mai-2011-129280.html&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Reporters Without Borders]] asked for the release of a detained pro-Gbagbo journalist.&lt;ref&gt;http://fr.rsf.org/cote-d-ivoire-mis-en-examen-un-journaliste-de-la-26-07-2011,40699.html&lt;/ref&gt; The personnel director of the company that published Le Temps, a newspaper close to FPI, was briefly arrested on 24 May 2011 and then released in the same day.&lt;ref&gt;http://en.rsf.org/cote-d-ivoire-pro-gbagbo-journalist-murdered-25-05-2011,40345.html&lt;/ref&gt; The Republican Forces of Côte d'Ivoire occupied the seat of Notre Voie, a newspaper close to FPI, from April to the beginning of September.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fratmat.info/component/content/article/51-culture/10523-presse-ivoirienne-les-frci-ont-libere-le-siege-de-qnotre-voieq |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-09-15 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110913012856/http://www.fratmat.info/component/content/article/51-culture/10523-presse-ivoirienne-les-frci-ont-libere-le-siege-de-qnotre-voieq |archivedate=13 September 2011 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Continuance of violence===
According to [[Human Right Watch]], the violence still persisted. Pro-Gbagbo militias had killed at least 220 people during the days immediately before or after the arrest of Gbagbo. In June 2011, it was reported that at least 149 actual or suspected pro-Gbagbo partisans had been killed by the force of Ouattara since April. In August, similar events committed by the force of Ouattara were reported again by the media.&lt;ref name="France Soir chronologie"/&gt; A summary of a press conference of UNOCI in August reported several confrontations between FRCI and youths in Ores-Krobou, Abadjin-Kouté, Abadjin-Doumé, Akoupé-Zeudji, and Biéby.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.onuci.org/spip.php?article6266&lt;/ref&gt;

At the night between 24–25 April 2012, Sakré, a village in the Southwest near Liberia was attacked by an armed group equipped with heavy weapons including rockets, leaving 8 deaths.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.rfi.fr/afrique/20120425-cote-ivoire-attaque-meurtriere-le-sud-ouest-pays&lt;/ref&gt;

===Politics===
On 1 June 2011, Guillaume Soro formed a new government. No one in the cabinet came from the pro-Gbagbo camp. Guillaume Soro is the prime minister and minister of defence.&lt;ref name="France Soir chronologie"/&gt; The mandate of Choi Young-ji ended on 31 August, and Albert Gerard Koenders became the new UN Special Representative for Côte d'Ivoire on 1 September.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.un.org/News/fr-press/docs/2011/SGA1303.doc.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

On 28 September, Commission dialogue, vérité et réconciliation (CDVR) (English: Dialogue, Truth, and Reconciliation Commission) was inaugurated in Yamoussoukro. It is an 11-member commission headed by former Prime Minister Charles Konan Banny. The commission includes religious leaders, regional representatives, and Chelsea footballer Didier Drogba to speak for Ivorians living abroad. It is modelled after the [[Truth and Reconciliation Commission of South Africa]]. However, Konan Banny expressed that the commission would not have amnesty powers nor powers to absolve anyone.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aip.ci/indexL.php?idl%3D21366%26Kt_Lecture%3D1 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-09-30 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120404234209/http://www.aip.ci/indexL.php?idl=21366&amp;Kt_Lecture=1 |archivedate=4 April 2012 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-africa-15086829 | work=BBC News | title=Ivory Coast gets truth and reconciliation commission | date=28 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://af.reuters.com/article/topNews/idAFJOE78S01T20110929 | work=Reuters | title=Ivory Coast launches post-conflict quest for truth | date=29 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A legislative election was announced in September and held on 11 December. It was the first legislative election since 2000, due to the crisis in 2002. Ouattara hoped that new legislators could be elected before the major development projects announced in the presidential campaign start.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.rfi.fr/afrique/20110910-cote-ivoire-fixe-legislatives-15-decembre&lt;/ref&gt; The election was boycotted by FPI, Gbagbo's party, and was won by the parties of Ouattara and his allies. The atmosphere of the election was calm, but the turnout was low.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://edition.cnn.com/2011/12/11/world/africa/ivory-coast-elections/ | work=CNN | title=Turnout low in Ivory Coast parliamentary vote - CNN.com | date=11 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Economy===
On 27 June 2011, UN lifted the last sanctions against Ivorian enterprises, including Radiodiffusion télévision ivoirienne (RTI), Association des producteurs de caoutchouc naturel de Côte d'Ivoire (APROCANCI), and Société de gestion du patrimoine de l'électricité (SOGEPE). On 8 July 2011, IMF resumed the aid to Côte d'Ivoire.&lt;ref name="France Soir chronologie"/&gt; On 25 October, the United States announced that Côte d'Ivoire, excluded since 2005, was again eligible for the [[African Growth and Opportunity Act]] (AGOA), which gives trade preferences to eligible countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aip.ci/indexL.php?idl%3D21991%26Kt_Lecture%3D1 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-10-29 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120404234336/http://www.aip.ci/indexL.php?idl=21991&amp;Kt_Lecture=1 |archivedate=4 April 2012 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 3 August 2012, the first commercial court of Côte d'Ivoire was set up in Abidjan, with the aim of encouraging the investment and the economical development.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.rfi.fr/afrique/20120804-cote-ivoire-installe-son-premier-tribunal-commerce-abidjan&lt;/ref&gt;

===Military===
On 3 August 2011, Ouattara promoted several important and controversial ex-chiefs in the New Forces who were said to have brought Ouattara to his position. Among those promoted was Martin Fofié Kouakou, appointed as the new commandant of [[Korhogo]], who had been accused of being involved in extrajuricial executions by UN.&lt;ref name="France Soir chronologie"/&gt;

===Gbagbo's capture===
Gbagbo was arrested on 11 April. From April to August, he and his wife, Simone, were under house arrest in separate locations in northern parts of the country. Gbagbo was sent to Korhogo and Simone to [[Odienné]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.francesoir.fr/actualite/international/cote-d-ivoire-simone-gbagbo-est-en-residence-surveillee-dans-nord-ouest-94788.html&lt;/ref&gt; Gbagbo and his wife were charged with economic crimes in August. The charges included looting, armed robbery and embezzlement. The government, citing its incompetence, has requested the involvement of the International Criminal Court (ICC) in the investigation of violence related crimes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-africa-14581870 | work=BBC News | title=Ivory Coast conflict: Gbagbos face economic charges | date=18 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 3 October, the judges of ICC authorized its prosecutor Luis Moreno-Ocampo to probe post-election war crimes and crimes against humanity committed by forces loyal to both Gbagbo and Ouattara.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.rfi.fr/afrique/20111129-cpi-lance-mandat-arret-contre-laurent-gbagbo-c%C3%B4te-ivoire&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.france24.com/en/20111129-i-coasts-gbagbo-faces-transfer-war-crimes-court{{dead link|date=September 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; With an arrest warrant issued on 23 November and made known to the public on 29 November, Gbagbo was sent from Côte d'Ivoire on 29 November and arrived in a prison in [[Scheveningen]], a suburb of [[the Hague]], on 30 November.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.nytimes.com/2011/12/01/world/africa/gbagbo-ivory-coast-hague-charges.html | work=The New York Times | first=Marlise | last=Simons | title=Ex-President of Ivory Coast Arrives in the Hague to Face Charges | date=30 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.france24.com/fr/20111130-cote-ivoire-laurent-gbagbo-cpi-justice-cour-penale-internationale-procedure-exactions-crimes-contre-humanite-meurtres&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.rfi.fr/afrique/20111201-plusieurs-mois-detention-haye-commencent-laurent-gbagbo&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''475''''' is a 2013 [[documentary]] [[cinema of Morocco|Moroccan film]] by director [[Nadir Bouhmouch]]. The film explores [[sexual violence]] and women's rights in Morocco through the [[Suicide of Amina Filali|Amina Filali]] affair, a young girl who committed suicide after being forced to marry her rapist in 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jadaliyya.com/pages/index/10234/exposing-sexual-violence-in-morocco_an-interview-w|title=Exposing Sexual Violence in Morocco: An Interview with Nadir Bouhmouch|work=jadaliyya.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Plot==
In March 2012, Amina Filali, a 16-year-old Moroccan girl, committed suicide by swallowing rat poison in a small village outside of [[Larache]]. Her suicide came a year after she was forced to marry a man who had raped her. According to Article 475 of the Moroccan penal code, a rapist can escape a jail sentence if he marries his victim. Authorities in Morocco failed to properly investigate Filali's death. Amina's death dominated the Moroccan and international media. Through this horrifying affair, interviews with Filali's parents, her rapist's father, a lawyer and other members of Moroccan civil society, the film delves into the various facets of patriarchy in Morocco while questioning the way it was portrayed by the mainstream media.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|publisher=BBC|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-middle-east-29167510|title=A Sense of Civic Responsibility|date=18 September 2014|access-date=19 Oct 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Production==
Like Bouhmouch's first film ''[[My Makhzen and Me]]'', ''475'' was produced clandestinely with no shooting permits in what director Nadir Bouhmouch calls "an act of civil disobedience" against Morocco's state film institution, the Centre Cinematographique Marocain (CCM); and what they perceive as restrictive film laws and censorship. The crew was reduced to a small team of volunteers who had little or no experience in filmmaking.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|publisher=GlobalPost|url=http://www.globalpost.com/dispatches/globalpost-blogs/rights/guerrilla-filmmakers-use-illegal-documentaries-celebrate-feb-20-a|title=Guerrilla filmmakers celebrate anniversary of Morocco's 'Arab uprising'|access-date=19 Oct 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Instead of asking for state funding from the CCM, the filmmakers resorted to a crowd-funding campaign.&lt;ref name=Kickstarter&gt;{{cite web|title=475: When Marriage Becomes Punishment|url=https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/article475/475-when-marriage-becomes-punishment|website=Kickstarter|accessdate=31 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Wikisourcelang|zh|原住民族和台灣政府新的夥伴關係|A New Partnership Between the Indigenous Peoples and the Government of Taiwan}}

'''A New Partnership Between the Indigenous Peoples and the Government of Taiwan''' ({{zh|c=原住民族和台灣政府新的夥伴關係|p=Yuán Zhù Mínzú Hé Táiwān Zhèngfǔ Xīn De Huǒbàn Guānxì}}) is a [[treaty]]-like document signed in [[Orchid Island]], [[Taiwan]] on 10 September 1999 by the representatives of the [[Taiwanese aborigines|indigenous peoples of Taiwan]] and the then-presidential candidate [[Chen Shui-bian]] (who went on to win the [[ROC presidential election, 2000|2000 presidential election]] for the [[Democratic Progressive Party]]).

The seven articles in the documents includes:
#Recognizing the inherent sovereignty of Taiwan’s Indigenous Peoples
#Promoting autonomy for Indigenous Peoples
#Concluding a land treaty with Taiwan’s Indigenous Peoples
#Reinstating traditional names of Indigenous communities and natural landmarks
#Recovering traditional territories of Indigenous communities and Peoples
#Recovering use of traditional natural resources and furthering the development of self-determination
#Providing legislative (parliamentary) representation for each Indigenous People

The document later became the official indigenous policy for the DPP Government.  However, as the document was signed before Shui-bian Chen became the President, the efficacy of the document has been contested. 

On 2002-10-19, Chen, as the head of state and government, reaffirmed the new partnership between indigenous nations and the Government of Taiwan in a ceremony with indigenous tribal representatives.

[[File:Francis Atterbury after Sir Godfrey Kneller, Bt.jpg|thumb|[[Francis Atterbury]], after [[Godfrey Kneller]] ]]
The '''Atterbury Plot''' was a conspiracy led by [[Francis Atterbury]], [[Bishop of Rochester]] and [[Dean of Westminster]], aimed at the restoration of the [[House of Stuart]] to the throne of [[Kingdom of Great Britain|Great Britain]]. It came some years after the unsuccessful [[Jacobite Rising of 1715]], at a time when the [[Whiggism|Whig]] government of the new [[House of Hanover|Hanoverian king]] was deeply unpopular.

Apart from Atterbury, other conspirators included [[Charles Boyle, 4th Earl of Orrery]], [[William North, 6th Baron North|Lord North and Grey]], [[Sir Henry Goring, 4th Baronet|Sir Henry Goring]], [[Christopher Layer]], [[John Plunkett (Jacobite)|John Plunkett]], and [[Seven_Men_of_Moidart#George_Kelly|George Kelly]].

The Plot was later considered the greatest threat to the Hanoverians between the [[Jacobite risings]] of 1715 and 1745.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lib.cam.ac.uk/exhibitions/Spies/Atterbury.html Atterbury] at lib.cam.ac.uk, accessed 10 June 2013&lt;/ref&gt; It collapsed in 1722, when some of the conspirators were charged with [[treason]]. However, evidence was in short supply, and Atterbury himself escaped with removal from his [[Church of England]] positions and exile.

==Background==
Atterbury was a [[Tory]] and a leader of the [[High Church]] party in the [[Church of England]]. In 1710, the prosecution of [[Henry Sacheverell]] led to an explosion of High Church fanaticism, and Atterbury helped Sacheverell with his defence, then became an active pamphleteer against the [[Whiggism|Whig]] ministry. When the ministry changed, rewards came to him. [[Anne, Queen of Great Britain|Queen Anne]] chose him as her chief adviser in church matters, and in August 1711 she appointed him [[List of Deans of Christ Church, Oxford|Dean]] of [[Christ Church, Oxford]], a strongly Tory college. In 1713 he was promoted to become [[Bishop of Rochester]] and Dean of [[Westminster Abbey]], and if the Tories had remained in power he might have risen much higher, so he dreaded the [[House of Hanover|Hanoverian accession]] planned by the [[Act of Settlement 1701|Act of Settlement]] of 1701. The death of Queen Anne in 1714 was a setback for him. He took the oath of allegiance to [[George I of Great Britain|George I]], but he became an opponent of the new government. He was in indirect communication with the family of the Pretender, and when the [[Jacobite rising of 1715|Jacobite Rising of 1715]] appeared, he refused to sign a declaration in which other bishops attached themselves to the Protestant accession. In 1717 hundreds of Jacobites arrested at the time of the Rising were released from prison by the [[Indemnity Act 1717|Act of Grace and Pardon]], and Atterbury began to correspond directly with [[James Francis Edward Stuart]]. He was later accused of plotting a coup d'état which involved the capture of the Hanoverian royal family and the proclamation of the Pretender as James III.&lt;ref name=dnb&gt;{{cite DNB|wstitle=Atterbury, Francis|volume=2|pages=233–238}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Events of 1720, notably the [[Bubble Act]] and the collapse of the [[South Sea Company]], left the pro-Hanoverian Whig government in disarray and deeply unpopular with the many [[ruling class]] investors who had lost heavily. Atterbury seized the moment to conspire with the exiled [[John Erskine, 22nd Earl of Mar]], who [[Jacobite Peerage|at the Jacobite court was]] [[Duke of Mar]], who had been the Pretender's Secretary of State.&lt;ref name=docs&gt;David Bayne Horn, Mary Ransome, eds., ''English Historical Documents: 1714–1783: VII'' (1996), p. 150&lt;/ref&gt;

==Plot of 1721==

The aim of the conspirators was a new Jacobite rising, to coincide with the [[British general election, 1722|general election expected in 1722]], this date being foreseen because by the [[Septennial Act 1716|Septennial Act]] of 1716 parliament was enabled to sit for seven years after the [[British general election, 1715|election of 1715]].&lt;ref name=docs/&gt;

[[Sir Henry Goring, 4th Baronet|Sir Henry Goring]], who was himself standing (unsuccessfully as turned out) in the election as MP for his old seat of [[Steyning (UK Parliament constituency)|Steyning]] in Sussex, wrote to the Pretender on 20 March 1721 a letter in which he put forward a plan for a restoration of the Stuart monarchy with the assistance of an invasion by Irish exile troops commanded by the [[James Butler, 2nd Duke of Ormonde|Duke of Ormonde]] from Spain and Lieutenant-General Dillon from France.&lt;ref name=hop&gt;[http://www.histparl.ac.uk/volume/1715-1754/member/goring-sir-henry-1679-1731] History of Parliament Online article on Goring by Eveline Cruickshanks.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Christopher Layer]], a [[barrister]] of the [[Middle Temple]] and an agent and legal advisor to the "notorious Jacobite" [[William North, 6th Baron North|Lord North and Grey]],&lt;ref&gt;Ian Higgins, ''Swift's Politics: A Study in Disaffection'' (1994), p. 146&lt;/ref&gt; met some fellow plotters regularly at an inn in [[Stratford-le-Bow]], and by the summer of 1721 had succeeded in recruiting some soldiers at [[Romford]] and [[Leytonstone]]. He then travelled to Rome, where he met the Pretender to reveal the details of a plot. Layer stated that he represented a large number of influential Jacobites, who proposed to recruit old soldiers to seize the [[Tower of London]], the [[Bank of England]], the [[Royal Mint]], and other government buildings in [[Westminster]] and the [[City of London]], to capture the Hanoverian royal family, and to kill other key men. English Tories were to summon their men, secure their counties, and march on London, while volunteers from the [[Irish Brigade (France)|Irish Brigade]] of the French Army were to land in England to join them. Layer returned to London with assurances of royal favour from the Pretender.&lt;ref name=dnblayer&gt;{{DNB|wstitle=Layer, Christopher|volume=32}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Collapse==
The plot collapsed in England in the spring of 1722, at the time of the death of [[Charles Spencer, 3rd Earl of Sunderland]], who a year before had been forced to resign as [[First Lord of the Treasury]]. He died on 19 April, when the [[Philippe II, Duke of Orléans|Duke of Orleans]], Regent of France, made it known to [[John Carteret, 2nd Earl Granville|Carteret]], [[Robert Walpole]]'s [[Secretary of State for the Southern Department]], that the Jacobites had asked him to send three thousand men in support of a coup d'état to take place early in May. The French said they had refused permission for the [[James Butler, 2nd Duke of Ormonde|Duke of Ormonde]] to march a force across France to a channel port and they had also moved their Irish Brigade away from [[Dunkirk]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Basil Williams (historian)|Basil Williams]], ''Carteret and Newcastle'' (1943), [https://books.google.com/books?id=S7M8AAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA48#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false p. 48]&lt;/ref&gt; Sunderland's papers were seized, and a letter of thanks addressed to him by the Pretender came to light.&lt;ref name=foda/&gt;

In England, insufficient money had been collected by the Jacobites to provide enough arms to support a rising, leading Mar (writing in March 1722) to comment on hearing this that Goring, "though a honest, stout, man, had not showed himself very fit for things of this kind."&lt;ref name=hop&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

Walpole's agents began the search for evidence against the leading suspects of [[Jacobitism]], but they found little. Despite this, Walpole gave orders for several men to be arrested: [[Charles Butler, 1st Earl of Arran|Arran]], [[Thomas Wentworth, 1st Earl of Strafford (1672–1739)|Strafford]], Orrery, North and Grey, Goring, Atterbury, the Duke of Mar's agent George Kelly, and Christopher Layer. Atterbury, who had long been an opponent of Walpole, was named as a conspirator by Mar and was arrested on 24 August 1722, to be charged with treason.&lt;ref name=foda&gt;[http://www.foda.org.uk/oaths/intro/introduction3.htm#25 Devon and Exeter Oath Rolls, 1723] at foda.org.uk/oaths, accessed 12 June 2013&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Alfred James Henderson, ''London and the national government, 1721–1742: a study of city politics and the Walpole administration'' (Duke University Press, 1945), p. 71&lt;/ref&gt; He and Orrery were imprisoned in the [[Tower of London]]. On 17 October the [[Habeas Corpus Act 1679|Habeas Corpus Act]] was suspended.&lt;ref&gt;Hywel Williams, ''Cassell's Chronology of World History'' (Weidenfeld &amp; Nicolson, 2005, {{ISBN|0-304-35730-8}}), p. 298&lt;/ref&gt; 

Goring, meanwhile, avoided arrest and had fled the country on 23 August; he remained in France until his death in 1731. In his absence, at a trial where he was considered one of the major managers of the plot, his agent stated Goring had attempted to enlist a gang of one thousand [[brandy]] [[smuggling|smugglers]] to assist the projected invasion. This led to some government action against such smuggling.&lt;ref name=hop&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

Layer was arrested and lodged with Atterbury in the Tower, his clerks were placed under surveillance, and his wife was arrested and brought to London from [[Dover]]. He was less fortunate than most of the others arrested, as two women agreed to give evidence against him. His case was first heard at the [[Court of King's Bench]] on 31 October 1722, and a trial began on 21 November before the Lord Chief Justice, [[John Pratt (judge)|John Pratt]]. Among compromising papers found in the possession of Elizabeth Mason, a brothel-keeper, was one entitled ''Scheme'', said to be in Layer's hand, which outlined a proposed insurrection. The Court was interested to have evidence that the [[James Francis Edward Stuart|Pretender]] and his wife had acted as godparents to Layer's daughter, when they were represented at a christening in [[Chelsea, London|Chelsea]] by the proxies Lord North and Grey and the [[James Butler, 2nd Duke of Ormonde|Duchess of Ormonde]].&lt;ref name=dnblayer/&gt; After a trial lasting eighteen hours, the jury unanimously found Layer guilty of [[treason|high treason]]. On 27 November 1722, he was sentenced to be [[hanged, drawn, and quartered]], but execution was several times delayed, in the hope of his giving information against others, which he refused to do. He was eventually executed at [[Tyburn]] on 17 May 1723.&lt;ref name=dnblayer/&gt;

Atterbury's correspondence with the Jacobites in exile which could be found proved to have been so cautious that it was not judged to be enough to lead to his conviction. He was therefore the target of a Pains and Penalties Bill, with the aim of removing him from his church positions, banishing him for life, and forbidding British subjects to communicate with him, by the decision of parliament rather than through prosecution in a court.&lt;ref name=dnb/&gt;&lt;ref name=szechi&gt;Daniel Szechi, ''The Jacobites: Britain and Europe, 1688–1788'', [https://books.google.com/books?id=kWr1KaDAxZEC&amp;pg=PR19#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false p. xix]&lt;/ref&gt; The evidence offered to parliament consisted chiefly of a [[spaniel]] named Harlequin, a present from the Pretender, and some letters found in a lavatory, leading to suspicions that Atterbury was the victim of a Whig conspiracy.&lt;ref&gt;Irvin Ehrenpreis, ''Swift: vol. III: Dean Swift'' (Routledge, 1983), [https://books.google.com/books?id=RRwOAAAAQAAJ&amp;pg=PA139#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false p. 139]&lt;/ref&gt; However, in May 1723 the Pains and Penalties Bill aimed at him was approved by the [[House of Commons of Great Britain|Commons]] and by the [[House of Lords|Lords]], where the voting was eighty-three votes for and forty-three against, being finally enacted on 15 May, two days before the execution of Layer. On 18 June, Atterbury went into exile in France.&lt;ref name=dnb/&gt;&lt;ref name=szechi/&gt; Orrery remained in the Tower for six months, after which he was given bail. There was insufficient evidence to proceed against him.&lt;ref&gt;Lawrence Berkley Smith, [http://ethos.bl.uk/OrderDetails.do?did=1&amp;uin=uk.bl.ethos.492677 Charles Boyle, 4th Earl of Orrery, 1674–1731], University of Edinburgh dissertation, 1994&lt;/ref&gt;

Among the other conspirators, John Plunkett and George Kelly were also arrested and were punished by being deprived of their estates.&lt;ref&gt;Henderson (1945), p. 72&lt;/ref&gt; Lord North and Grey was known to be involved, but those who could have implicated him refused to do so.&lt;ref&gt;Eveline Cruickshanks, 'Lord North, Christopher Layer and the Atterbury Plot: 1720–23', in ''The Jacobite Challenge'' (Edinburgh, 1988), p. 94&lt;/ref&gt;

In January 1723, a secret parliamentary committee was established to investigate the Plot, and this reported in March of the same year. The [[Papists Act 1722]] required landowners to take oaths of allegiance by Christmas Day, 1723; those who would not do so were obliged to register their estates and risked forfeiting them.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.foda.org.uk/oaths/intro/glossary.htm#1723act 1723 Act] at foda.org.uk&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Ottoman Sultan Selim III (1789).jpg|thumb|upright=1.5|Audience of the French diplomat le Vicomte d'Andrezel with the Sultan [[Selim III]] on 10 October 1724 in the [[Topkapı Palace]].]]
An '''audience''' is a formal meeting that takes place between a [[head of state]] and another person at the invitation of the head of state. Often, the invitation follows a request for a meeting from the other person. Though sometimes used in republics to describe meetings with [[president]]s, the term is more usually associated with [[monarch]]s and [[pope]]s.

==Holy See==
In the past, rigid [[dress code]]s had to be followed by those granted a papal audience. Although no longer mandatory, the traditional dress code was quite strict. For a general audience, smart business professional attire (i.e,. a suit and tie or equivalent for ladies) was acceptable. The suit was to be dark, and ladies would ideally not wear slacks anywhere in the Vatican. Private audiences, however, were a much more formal affair. Ladies were to wear a long (well below the knees), black dress, with a matching hat or other head covering and veil. Exceptions were made for [[Rex Catholicissimus|Catholic queens]] who by dispensation could wear white ([[privilège du blanc]]). Gentlemen were to wear a correct [[morning suit]], either black or very dark gray with the traditional striped trousers, patent leather shoes, and [[morning coat|cutaway]]. An ascot or equivalent formal tie would be worn with a gray waistcoat over a white dress shirt with arrow collars. If any part of the audience was to occur outdoors a black top hat would be worn. If the function was entirely indoors then the hat was optional for men. Both gentlemen and ladies were to wear dress gloves. Evening functions were usually [[white tie]].

Formal dress is now normally reserved for diplomatic audiences. In the 1990s, a Roman Catholic priest in Ireland provoked a controversy by claiming that then-[[President of Ireland]], [[Mary Robinson]], had breached protocol by wearing jewellery and by not wearing black nor a [[mantilla]] for an audience with [[Pope John Paul II]]. The Vatican subsequently pointed out that the traditional form of dress worn for papal audiences was no longer obligatory.

Modern popes grant large audiences to crowds in [[Saint Peter's Square|St. Peter's Square]] or the [[Paul VI Audience Hall]].

==United Kingdom==
In the [[United Kingdom]], audiences with the [[British monarch]] are usually listed in the [[Court Circular]], which is published daily by the [[broadsheet]] press. The [[Prime Minister of the United Kingdom|British Prime Minister]] has a weekly audience with [[Elizabeth II]], usually every Wednesday,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.royal.gov.uk/HMTheQueen/DayInTheLife/TheQueensworkingday/Evening.aspx |title=Archived copy |accessdate=11 March 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130307195445/https://www.royal.gov.uk/HMTheQueen/DayInTheLife/TheQueensworkingday/Evening.aspx |archivedate=7 March 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; during parliamentary time at [[Buckingham Palace]].

==Denmark==
In the [[Kingdom of Denmark]], public audiences with the Queen usually take place every other Monday at [[Christiansborg Palace]]. An invitation is not required for the public audiences. Private audiences of the Queen with [[heads of state]], [[heads of government]], parliamentary delegations, leaders of international organisations and military leaders are usually held at the residence palace of the Monarch at [[Amalienborg Palace]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://kongehuset.dk/monarkiet-i-danmark/Offentlig-audiens/audiens| title=Audiens| publisher=kongehuset.dk| accessdate=2012-06-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="31088">'''Campus Antiwar Network''' (CAN) is an [[United States|American]] independent grassroots network of students opposing the [[History of Iraq (2003–2011)|occupation of Iraq]] and [[military recruitment|military recruiters]] in US schools.  It was founded prior to the 2003 invasion of [[Iraq]], and claims to be the largest campus-based [[antiwar]] organization in the [[United States]].&lt;ref name="can-intro"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.campusantiwar.net/index.php?option=content&amp;task=view&amp;id=93&amp;Itemid=52 | title=What is CAN? | work=Campus Antiwar Network website | date=7 September 2005 | accessdate=2006-02-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

The Campus Antiwar Network was created on January 17, 2003 by delegates from over 70 colleges and universities at twin conferences at [[George Washington University]] and [[San Francisco State University]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://grassrootspeace.org/CANjan1703.html grassrootspeace.org&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;  Its purpose was opposition to the planned invasion of Iraq.

Because it is decentralized, CAN's size and impact do not necessarily correlate with its national events and organizations, but the group's history can be tracked roughly by its national conventions.

===First National CAN Convention===
''Chicago, Illinois—February 22–23, 2003''

CAN's first national conference occurred very soon after its formation, the weekend of February 22–23, in [[Chicago]], and formalized the organization's structure and politics.  The 2003 convention occurred during a period of rapid growth of the antiwar movement, just prior to the invasion of Iraq and soon after the [[February 15, 2003 anti-war protest]], the largest in world history.  The convention was attended by more than 350 delegates from approximately 100 campus groups.

At its 2003 convention, CAN adopted a structure under the principle that it be student owned and operated.  The specific directives were:

&lt;blockquote&gt;CAN will remain independent, and is not affiliated with any other organization, though it pledges to work with all forces in the antiwar movement; it is democratic, so that each member campus can elect delegates through their local antiwar student coalitions and each affiliated campus group has an equal voice within CAN; CAN accepts affiliation from every campus or school antiwar organization and respects the right of its member committees to organize independent antiwar actions locally.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

CAN adopted its first four Points of Unity: 
#No war on Iraq, whether backed by the U.S. or the [[United Nations]] 
#End the UN [[International sanctions|sanctions]] which have killed more than 1 million Iraqis 
#Oppose the attacks on civil liberties and racist [[scapegoating]] at home 
#Money for jobs, education, and health care, not war.

CAN also decided to call for an April 5 national mobilization in a few major cities following on the heels of the student-labor week of action already being organized from March 31 to April 4.&lt;ref&gt;[http://traprockpeace.org/CANmediaalert022503.html grassrootspeace.org&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Second National CAN Convention===
''Chicago, Illinois—November 1–2, 2003''

The U.S. antiwar movement lost momentum with the failure of mass protests to prevent the invasion, and the Campus Antiwar Network was affected by the trend.  CAN's second convention, on November 1–2, 2003, was attended by approximately 100 members, from 34 different campuses around the country.

The primary goals of the activists were to discuss the past six months of work since CAN's creation in January, and to organize future goals as well as further codifying the Points of Unity. An important national action taken from this conference was the resurrection of the "black armband" as a symbol of antiwar unity; a throwback from the [[Opposition to the Vietnam War|Vietnam War]].

The Points of Unity were expanded into the following:
#We stand opposed to all US wars of aggression.
#We stand opposed to the occupation of Iraq.
#We support the right of the Iraqi people to self-determination.
#We demand the immediate withdrawal of all troops from Iraq.
#We call for the US government to pay reparations to the Iraqi people.
#We stand opposed to the oppression of the Palestinian people and the occupation of the West Bank and Gaza Strip.
#We stand opposed to racist scapegoating and all attacks on civil liberties.
#We demand money for education, jobs and health care, not war and occupation!

==="Stop the War in 2004"===
''New York City, New York—November 13–14, 2004''

Over 100 delegates from 30 schools were in attendance at "Stop the War in 2004," which was focused around recovering from the recent [[United States presidential election, 2004|presidential election]] and the re-election of George W. Bush. The main speaker at the event was [[Mike Hoffman (veteran)|Mike Hoffman]], co-founder of the [[Iraq Veterans Against the War]], who spoke about the Iraqi response to the occupation.

CAN decided to increase positive interaction and support with military groups opposing the occupation of Iraq, as well as to organize demonstrations "against George Bush's inauguration."&lt;ref&gt;[http://campusantiwar.net/index.php?option=content&amp;task=view&amp;id=57 Campus Antiwar Network&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

Although all other Points were proposed to stand as created, the national conference revised the Point of Unity on the [[Israeli–Palestinian conflict]]:

&lt;blockquote&gt;We stand opposed to the oppression of the Palestinian people and the occupation of Palestinian land, and support the right of Palestinians to self-determination.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==="On the Frontlines"===
''Berkeley, California—October 22–23, 2005''

With falling approval ratings for President [[George W. Bush]] and the war, the growth of the [[counter-recruitment]] movement, and [[Cindy Sheehan]]'s rise to national prominence, CAN grew significantly over the course of 2005.  Its fourth national conference, held October 22–23, 2005, at [[UC Berkeley]], drew over 650 participants, with delegates from 37 schools present to vote on the second, organizational, day.&lt;ref name="traprock"&gt;{{cite web | author=Jenks, Charlie | url=http://traprockpeace.org/campus_antiwar.html | title=CAN History | work=Traprock Peace Center website | date=24 January 2005 | accessdate=2006-02-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The conference, jointly sponsored by the Campus Antiwar Network and Military Out of Our Schools-Bay Area, sought to deepen the growing counter-recruitment movement among students.  It decided on several nationally coordinated events for the upcoming year: a day of action in protest of the [[Solomon Amendment]] requiring universities to allow military recruitment on December 6 of that year; a week of action marking the anniversary of the war in Iraq, with student actions planned on campuses and general, off-campus actions on the weekend of March 18–19, 2006; and a day of action on May 4, 2006, the anniversary of the killing of four students at [[Kent State shootings|Kent State]] by National Guardsmen during a protest against the [[Vietnam War]], as well as a memorial for the lesser-known shooting of two [[Jackson State killings|Jackson State]] students on May 14.  CAN's call for the student week of action was endorsed by many individuals and organizations including [[Cindy Sheehan]], [[Howard Zinn]], and the [[Progressive Democrats of America]].

CAN's Points of Unity and national structure were unchanged.

==="Students Rising"===
''Madison, Wisconsin—October 19–21, 2007''
[[File:Can conference 2007.jpg|right|300px|thumb|Activists listen to Camilo Mejía's speech at CAN's fifth national conference in Madison.]]

The surge in the antiwar movement in late 2005 did not last through 2006, and over the course of that year the Campus Antiwar Network lost much of its national organization, rebuilding only in the spring of 2007.  After a one-year hiatus without a national conference, CAN reconvened over the weekend of October 19–21, 2007, to discuss its Points of Unity and to solidify membership.  Over 30 chapters sent representatives, with an estimated 200 activists (both delegates and guests) attending.  The main event was speaker [[Camilo Mejía]], who talked about his time in Iraq and his gradual realization of his antiwar feelings. Mejía and [[Liam Madden]], both members of the [[Iraq Veterans Against the War]], were in attendance throughout the conference.

CAN revised its Points of Unity into the following Unity Statement:
&lt;blockquote&gt;The Campus Antiwar Network stands for the immediate withdrawal from Iraq of all occupation troops and private contractors. CAN is committed to building a movement based on grassroots, democratic and independent organizing that actively opposes all forms of racism, Islamophobia, sexism and homophobia.&lt;ref&gt;[http://campusantiwar.net/index.php?option=content&amp;task=view&amp;id=195 Campus Antiwar Network&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Structure==
The Campus Antiwar Network is a network of largely independent affiliates which choose their own day-to-day goals and tactics. CAN brings them together, usually only by [[email]] and [[conference call]], to share the lessons of experience, discuss and decide on a view of the present needs of the [[peace movement]], assist each other in defending against threatened disciplinary action or prosecution, and plan coordinated actions on both national and regional levels.  Major decisions regarding structure and points of unity are made at CAN's yearly national conference, attended by 2 delegates with voting rights from each chapter, as well as an unlimited number of guests.

The organization also has a coordinating committee, elected at each national conference. As of the nation conference in 2007, the national committee has been restructured from previous forms to have five regional representatives and four at-large representatives, with decisions made by majority rule. In the past, the committee has had one representative from each of five regions, five at-large representatives, and two high school representatives.

Individual CAN affiliates organize as they choose, although each is asked to select two members to give their contact information to the national coordinating committee.  The coordinating committee is responsible for coordinating actions voted on at the national conference.&lt;ref name="minutes"&gt;{{cite web | author=Karpoff, Josh | url=http://traprockpeace.org/campus_antiwar_network/index.php/2005/10/28/minutes-2005-campus-antiwar-network-national-conference-oct-22-23-2005-berkeley-ca/ | title=CAN Conference 2005 Minutes | work=Campus Antiwar Network blog | date=28 October 2005 | accessdate=2006-02-27 | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060712160010/http://www.traprockpeace.org/campus_antiwar_network/index.php/2005/10/28/minutes-2005-campus-antiwar-network-national-conference-oct-22-23-2005-berkeley-ca/ | archivedate=12 July 2006 | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Politics==
CAN's only formal political consensus stems from its Points of Unity, or Unity Statement, selected at the national conference.  CAN periodically updates its Points of Unity based on the current state of the war and antiwar movement.

CAN is first and foremost a group opposed to the [[war in Iraq]].  However, besides calling for immediate withdrawal of all U.S. troops from Iraq, Points of Unity have included opposition to the war in [[Afghanistan]], opposition to [[Israel]]'s [[occupation of Palestine]], and other views.  Although some opinions are more controversial than others, CAN strives to reflect the viewpoints of its democratic and varying membership.  CAN affiliates are involved in actions around these issues to varying degrees, and individual members may or may not agree with all points; CAN chapters are welcome to choose their own political positions and affiliations beyond the Points of Unity that all chapters follow.

Throughout its history, CAN has focused on grassroots organizing, and put [[counter-recruitment|opposition to US military recruitment]] and building relationships with antiwar U.S. veterans and soldiers at the center of its strategy to end the war.  CAN does not take official positions on elections of any kind, believing that such choices should be based on individual preferences. However, CAN actively encourages members and chapters to become as informed on elections as possible, and local chapters often incorporate political discussions into their own meetings.

After [[Hurricane Katrina]], by decision of its coordinating committee, CAN adopted the slogan "Relief Not War!" for the September 25, 2005 protest in Washington, DC.  This issue was connected to the war, for CAN members, by the repressive military nature of the relief efforts as well as by the diversion of resources abroad.  In February 2006, CAN issued a statement on the [[Jyllands-Posten Muhammad cartoons controversy|Danish cartoons controversy]], condemning "racism in any form, as recently displayed in the publication of a series of anti-Islamic cartoons," which it argued "are helping to promulgate state violence against Muslims and Arabs -- including the occupation of Iraq." The statement also attacked the [[Dubai Ports World controversy]], describing widespread bipartisan opposition to allowing a company from the United Arab Emirates to take ownership of some U.S. port operations as "blatantly racist."&lt;ref name="can-racism"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.campusantiwar.net/index.php?option=content&amp;task=view&amp;id=144&amp;Itemid=2 | title=CAN condemns racism against Muslims and Arabs | work=Campus Antiwar Network website | date=28 February 2006 | accessdate=2006-03-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; Anti-racism points of unity were integrated into the Unity Statement in 2007.

==Tactics==

Historically, the Campus Antiwar Network has used a variety of [[tactic (method)|tactics]]:

*[[Demonstration (people)|National demonstrations]]: CAN helped to mobilize students for the national February 15, 2003 antiwar protest demonstrations prior to the invasion of Iraq, and more recently marched with a contingent estimated by organizers at two thousand people at the [[September 24, 2005 anti-war protest]] in Washington, DC.  It has also called its own national actions.&lt;ref name="traprock" /&gt;  For example, CAN called for and organized a day of action on December 6, 2005, the date that the [[Supreme Court of the United States|Supreme Court]] heard [[Forum for Academic and Institutional Rights|FAIR]] v. [[Donald Rumsfeld|Rumsfeld]], a case deciding the constitutionality of the [[Solomon Amendment]]'s provision denying federal funding to colleges that ban military recruiters. The action consisted of protests at recruiting stations across the country.&lt;ref name="cd"&gt;{{cite journal | author=Schenwar, Maya | url=http://www.commondreams.org/views05/1205-32.htm | title=Counter-Recruitment Day Sweeps US Colleges | journal=[[Common Dreams]] | date=5 December 2005 | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20051214202332/http://www.commondreams.org/views05/1205-32.htm | archivedate=14 December 2005 | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[Referendum]]s: CAN helped write and campaign for the [[Proposition I/College Not Combat|"College Not Combat"]] ballot measure passed by residents of [[San Francisco]] on November 2, 2005, described by proponents as a statement that voters "want it to be city policy to oppose military recruiters’ access to public schools and to consider funding scholarships for education and training that could provide an alternative to military service."&lt;ref name="cnc"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.collegenotcombat.org/ | title=We Won! | work=College Not Combat website | accessdate=2006-02-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*Direct [[aid]]: CAN sent caravans to [[New Orleans]] from places such as [[New York (city)|New York]] and [[Chicago]], after Hurricane Katrina.  These brought supplies and volunteers to work with local [[Louisiana]] activists, such as [[Malik Rahim]], towards hurricane relief. The New York students kept a journal of their activities called [http://www.campusantiwar.net/index.php?option=content&amp;task=view&amp;id=97&amp;Itemid=2 "This is solidarity, not charity"].
*Talks, debates, and speaking tours: In Fall of 2003, the Campus Antiwar Network (CAN) and [[Muslim Students' Association]] (MSA) organized a national speaking tour titled "Speaking Truth to Empire." The tour's purpose was to reorganize the  student antiwar movement. Featured speakers included [[Noam Chomsky]], [[Rania Masri]], [[Howard Zinn]], as well as military families and veterans.&lt;ref&gt;[http://campusantiwar.net/index.php?option=content&amp;task=view&amp;id=20 Campus Antiwar Network - Berkeley&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; Following this, CAN and MSA co-sponsored another tour called "Eyewitness to Empire," which featured CAN member, [[Khury-Petersen Smith]], who traveled to Iraq and spent a week in Baghdad during January 2004.&lt;ref&gt;[http://campusantiwar.net/index.php?option=content&amp;task=view&amp;id=44 Campus Antiwar Network - San Francisco State University&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[Petitions]], letters, and phone calls to school and government officials.
*Creative performances of various kinds, involving, for example, [[spoken word]] poetry and [[hip hop music|hip hop]] artists.
*International collaboration.  CAN sent delegates to the [[London]] International Peace Conference on December 10, 2005.  CAN also put on a panel discussion called "Fighting the Empire From Within," featuring CAN activists involved in military "counter-recruitment," war resister Pablo Paredes, and others, at the 2006 [[World Social Forum]] in [[Caracas]], Venezuela.&lt;ref name="traprock-ipc"&gt;{{cite web | author=Jenks, Charlie | url=http://traprockpeace.org/london_peace_10dec05.html | title=London International Peace Conference | work=Traprock Peace Center website | date=10 December 2005 | accessdate=2006-02-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; More recently, CAN has nationally decided to get involved with the Iraqi Student Project,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.iraqistudentproject.org/&lt;/ref&gt; a humanitarian aid project which seeks to bring Iraqi college students to America for higher education.
*Blockades and [[Direct Action]]: CAN claimed sector 6 in the [[RNC Welcoming Committee]] map at the St Paul [[Republican National Convention]] in 2008, where they attempted to block Republican delegates from reaching the excel center in an attempt to prevent a quorum.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nornc.org/2008/07/15/sector-6-can/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2008-11-04 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120726063017/http://www.nornc.org/2008/07/15/sector-6-can/ |archivedate=2012-07-26 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Six members were arrested at the RNC, one was charged with conspiracy to riot, felony.

===Student walkouts===
Campus Antiwar Network chapters have long used local walkouts as a tactic to demonstrate against the militarization of campus and collusion with war related activities while galvanizing public opinion on campus, unifying CAN groups with other progressive groups, and recruiting new members. The network is able to utilize the internet and conference calls to rapidly create walk outs, although most of the largest walkouts are on specific anniversaries or important dates.

Several walkouts occurred immediately after the US invasion of Iraq including a large one at San Francisco State University.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.traprockpeace.org/campus_antiwar_1.html Student Activism - Campus Antiwar Network&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; In 2005, a walkout took place at the [[University of Wisconsin in Madison]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://badgerherald.com/news/2005/11/03/antiwar_groups_stage.php The Badger Herald - Anti-war groups stage walk-out&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;  Over 100 students left class, demonstrated, and then marched past the Army Recruitment Center at University Square.&lt;ref&gt;[http://badgerherald.com/news/2005/04/15/demonstrators_walk_o.php The Badger Herald - Demonstrators ‘Walk Out’ against occupation of Iraq&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2007, large walkouts occurred as a result of the efforts of CAN groups.  On February 15, the fourth anniversary of the largest antiwar demonstrations in history, walkouts occurred at 17 different schools including [[Columbia University]].&lt;ref&gt;http://media.www.columbiaspectator.com/media/storage/paper865/news/2007/02/15/News/Walkout.Set.For.Today-2722194.shtml{{dead link|date=January 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The Columbia walkout achieved campus-wide support including a petition signed by forty professors and an endorsement by three campus unions.  Three hundred students participated in the antiwar activities that followed.

On March 20, 2007, the fourth anniversary of the invasion of Iraq, nearly 80 schools answered calls from Campus Antiwar Network and [[Students for a Democratic Society (2006 organization)|Students for a Democratic Society]] to walk out of class in protest of the war.  Hundreds of students from schools across the country walked out against the war and demonstrated in highly visible locations. At [[Rutgers University]] in New Brunswick New Jersey, 400 students walked out of class, blocked a marine recruiting station, and took over an interstate highway.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.traprockpeace.org/campus_antiwar_network/index.php/2007/05/09/the-great-rutgers-walkout/ Campus Antiwar Network Consolidated Blog » Blog Archive » The Great Rutgers Walkout&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070814190033/http://www.traprockpeace.org/campus_antiwar_network/index.php/2007/05/09/the-great-rutgers-walkout/ |date=2007-08-14 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

CAN views walkouts as a good way to get students involved with the antiwar movement for the first time. As many students fight against the apathy that is the generalization of their generation,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/01/27/AR2007012701215.html | work=The Washington Post | title=Student Protesters, Fighting Image of Apathy, Call for a Cohesive Movement | first=Megan | last=Greenwell | date=January 28, 2007 | accessdate=April 28, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; viewing fellow collegiates in action is important to continue growing the movement.

==Repression==
A number of people involved with the Campus Antiwar Network have faced legal or disciplinary consequences of various kinds for their antiwar activism.  These people have been the centers of nationwide defense campaigns on the part of CAN, which argues that their cases prove the threat counter-recruitment poses to the powers that be.

*In March 2004, at [[City College of New York]], four people were arrested at a counter-recruitment protest (after twice, at earlier protests, forcing recruiters off campus) for allegedly assaulting campus security, though they claim that the reverse was the case.  One, Hadas Thier, was banned from campus and suspended.  Charges have since been dropped.&lt;ref name="lrp"&gt;{{cite journal | url=http://www.lrp-cofi.org/PR/ccnyPR75.html | title=CCNY Cracks Down on Anti-Military Protesters | journal=[[League for the Revolutionary Party|Proletarian Revolution]] | issue=75 | year=Fall 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*In March 2005, three student activists, [[Katrina Yeaw]], Michael Hoffman and Pardis Esmaeili, from [[San Francisco State University]] received letters stating that the administration had received a complaint from the Chief of Public Safety for their involvement in a counter-recruitment protest on campus and that each student must meet individually with Judicial Affairs. The following week the six student organizations that endorsed the demonstration received letters stating that disciplinary proceedings were going forward against them. The charges against four of the groups and three student activists were eventually dropped but the university went forward with hearing against the [[International Socialist Organization]] and Students Against War, convicting both groups of all charges against them in absentia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.counterpunch.org/yeaw06092005.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2008-11-24 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081229133134/http://www.counterpunch.org/yeaw06092005.html |archivedate=2008-12-29 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;
*Charles Peterson at [[Holyoke Community College]] was pepper sprayed, banned from campus, and threatened with expulsion after allegedly assaulting a campus security officer while protesting military recruiters; he claims that he merely grabbed back a sign the officer took from a fellow protester.  Charges have since been dropped.&lt;ref name="nation"&gt;{{cite journal | author=Grim, Ryan | url=http://www.thenation.com/doc/20051031/protest_and_pushback_on_campus | title=Protest and Pushback on Campus | journal=[[The Nation]] | date=31 October 2005 | subscription=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*Tariq Khan, a student at [[George Mason University]] and [[United States Air Force|Air Force]] veteran, was arrested for standing near recruiters with a sign saying "Recruiters Tell Lies" taped to his shirt on the charge of trespassing and disorderly conduct.  Khan is a Pakistani-American; he reported that one arresting officer told him, "You people are the most violent people in the world."  Charges have since been dropped.&lt;ref name="nation" /&gt;
*[https://www.rollingstone.com/news/story/_/id/8957250 Dave Airhart], a student at [[Kent State]] and a [[United States Marine Corps|Marine]] veteran of Iraq and Afghanistan, was fined by city police and threatened with expulsion after hanging a banner with an antiwar message on a climbing wall set up on campus by military recruiters.  Charges have since been dropped.&lt;ref name="kos"&gt;{{cite web | author="Maduin" | url=http://www.dailykos.com/tag/David%20Airhart | title=Kent State Drops Charges Against David Airhart | work=[[Daily Kos]] | accessdate=2006-02-27 | date=17 November 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*Seven students at [[Hampton University]] were punished for participating in an unauthorized protest and "proselytizing" during a walkout on November 2, 2005.  The students were initially summoned for an administrative hearing on November 21 to present a case against their expulsion, with three days notice, but it was then postponed to December 2, and finally the school decided only to impose community service.&lt;ref name="robinson"&gt;{{cite web | author=Robinson, John | url=http://www.campusantiwar.net/index.php?option=content&amp;task=view&amp;id=134 | title=Students Not Expelled! - But Fight Not Over | work=Campus Antiwar Network website | accessdate=2006-02-27 | date=3 December 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==="Credible Threat" to National Security===
On April 5, 2005, Santa Cruz students and members of the Campus Antiwar Network led a major demonstration on the campus of [[UC Santa Cruz]].  According to the [[San Francisco Chronicle]], "about a dozen protesters entered a career fair in a campus building and surrounded a table where military recruiters sat, preventing other students from talking with them. [And] more than 300 people demonstrated outside. In the jostling that ensued, a career- center staffer was slightly injured."   The protest had significant results, according to Kristin Anderson, a member of the Campus Antiwar Network.  She believes that counter recruitment "has gotten popular because it gives students something concrete they can do" and students are able to make connections if they see their classmates being tempted by recruiters. UC Santa Cruz antiwar group, "Members of Students Against War" rallied outside of the "San Francisco's Civic Center" wearing T-shirts reading, "Credible Threat."   This was done to mock the "Pentagon spymasters' assessment of the group's activities."&lt;ref&gt;Garofoli. Joe. "Santa Cruz students nurture anti-war role / Pentagon listing has made them 'credible'." The San Francisco Chronicle: Mar 15, 2006.  pg.

In 2007, while a senior in high school, Owens received threatening racist phone calls that were traced to a car in which the 14-year-old son of then mayor [[Dannel Malloy]] was present. Owens' family sued the Stamford Board of Education in federal court alleging that the city did not protect her rights, resulting in a $37,500 settlement.&lt;ref name="CTPostVictim" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.newstimes.com/news/article/Racist-threats-case-filed-by-Stamford-High-107476.php|newspaper=Danbury News Times|title=Racist Threats Case Filed by Stamford High Student Settled for $37,500|date=January 23, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Owens was pursuing an undergraduate degree in journalism at the [[University of Rhode Island]] but left school after her junior year.&lt;ref name=":12" /&gt; Afterwards, she worked for [[Vogue (magazine)|''Vogue'']] magazine.&lt;ref name="CTPostVictim" /&gt; In 2012, she took a job as an administrative assistant for a private equity firm.&lt;ref name="CTPostVictim" /&gt;

== Career ==

=== Privacy violation, Gamergate and political transformation ===
Owens launched SocialAutopsy.com in 2016, a website she said would expose [[Cyberbullying|bullies on the Internet]] by tracking their digital footprint.&lt;ref name=":12" /&gt;&lt;ref name=CTPostVictim /&gt;&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.thedailybeast.com/meet-kanye-wests-toxic-far-right-consigliere|title=Meet Candace Owens, Kanye West's Toxic Far-Right Consigliere|last=Zimmerman|first=Amy|date=May 9, 2018|work=The Daily Beast|access-date=May 18, 2018|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; The proposed site would have solicited users to take screenshots of offensive posts and send them to the website, where they would be categorized by the user's name.&lt;ref name=CTPostVictim /&gt; She used [[crowdfunded|crowdfunding]] on [[Kickstarter]] for the website. The proposal was immediately controversial, drawing criticism that she was de-anonymizing ([[doxing]]) Internet users and violating their privacy.&lt;ref name=":12" /&gt;&lt;ref name="NYMAG"/&gt; According to ''[[The Daily Dot]]'', "People from all sides of the anti-harassment debate were quick to criticize the database, calling it a public-shaming list that would encourage [[doxing]] and retaliatory harassment."&lt;ref name="DailyDot"&gt;[https://www.dailydot.com/irl/online-bullying-database-doxing-kickstarter-suspended/ Controversial Bully Shaming Database Loses Kickstarter but Will Launch Anyway]. [[The Daily Dot]], April 15, 2016&lt;/ref&gt; Both conservatives and progressives involved in the [[Gamergate controversy]] condemned the website.&lt;ref name=":12" /&gt;

In response, people began posting Owens' private details online.&lt;ref name=":12" /&gt; Owens blamed, without evidence, the doxing on progressives involved in the Gamergate controversy.&lt;ref name=":12" /&gt;&lt;ref name="NYMAG"&gt;{{Cite web |last1=Singal |first1=Jesse |title=The Strange Tale of Social Autopsy, the Anti-Harassment Start-up That Descended into Gamergate Trutherism |work=[[New York (magazine)|Select All]] |date=April 18, 2018 |url=http://nymag.com/selectall/2016/04/how-social-autopsy-fell-for-gamergate-trutherism.html |language=en |accessdate=August 26, 2018  }}&lt;/ref&gt; After this, she earned the support of conservatives involved in the Gamergate controversy, including right-wing political commentators and Trump supporters [[Milo Yiannopoulos]] and [[Mike Cernovich]].&lt;ref name=":12" /&gt; After this, Owens became a conservative, saying in 2017, "I became a conservative overnight&amp;nbsp;... I realized that liberals were actually the racists. Liberals were actually the trolls&amp;nbsp;... Social Autopsy is why I'm conservative".&lt;ref name=":12" /&gt;

Kickstarter suspended funding for Social Autopsy, and the website was never created.&lt;ref name="NYMAG" /&gt;

=== Media and conservative activism ===
In 2015, Owens founded the website Degree180.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":12" /&gt; The website frequently posted anti-conservative and anti-Trump content, including mockery of his penis size.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite news|date=May 15, 2018|url=https://www.buzzfeed.com/josephbernstein/the-newest-star-of-the-trump-movement-ran-a-trump-bashing|title=The Newest Star of the Trump Movement  Ran a Trump-Bashing Publication&amp;nbsp;– Less Than Two Years Ago|work=BuzzFeed|access-date=May 16, 2018|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":11"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://thehill.com/blogs/blog-briefing-room/387883-conservative-activist-praised-by-trump-once-ran-online-publication|title=Activist Praised by Trump Once Ran Online Publication That Mocked Him: Report|last=Sanchez|first=Luis|date=May 15, 2018|work=TheHill|access-date=May 16, 2018|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a 2015 column that Owens wrote for the site she criticized conservative Republicans, writing about the "bat-shit-crazy antics of the Republican Tea Party", adding, "The good news is, they will eventually die off (peacefully in their sleep, we hope), and then we can get right on with the OBVIOUS social change that needs to happen, IMMEDIATELY."&lt;ref name=":12"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.realclearlife.com/daily-brief/candace-owens-used-run-liberal-leaning-website/|title=Degree180: Candace Owens' Defunct Liberal-Leaning Website|date=May 16, 2018|publisher=|accessdate=October 30, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.degree180.com/jokes-on-us-the-republican-tea-party-is-being-led-by-the-mad-hatter/|title=News Update: The Republican Tea Party Is Led by the Mad Hatter|last1=Owens|first1=Candace|date=October 4, 2015|publisher=Degree180|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170823111144/http://www.degree180.com/jokes-on-us-the-republican-tea-party-is-being-led-by-the-mad-hatter/|archive-date=August 13, 2017|accessdate=January 7, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":2"/&gt;&lt;ref name=":12" /&gt; When ''Buzzfeed News'' in May 2018 reported on the anti-Trump content on Degree180, Owens described the Buzzfeed reporter as a "despicable creature" and alleged that Buzzfeed had threatened the former writers of Degree180 (an allegation that Buzzfeed denied).&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

By 2017, Owens had become prominent in conservative circles for her pro-Trump commentary and for criticizing liberal rhetoric regarding structural racism, systemic inequality, and identity politics.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; In 2017, she began posting politically themed videos to YouTube.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; She launched Red Pill Black, a website and [[YouTube]] channel that promotes [[black conservatism in the United States]].&lt;ref name="SalonStar"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.salon.com/2017/09/25/candace-owens-red-pill-black-youtube/|title=Candace Owens of Red Pill Black, the Toxic Right's Newest African-American Star|last=Watkins|first=D|authorlink=|date=September 25, 2017|publisher=[[Salon (website)|Salon]]|accessdate=|quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="FoxRedPill"&gt;[http://www.foxnews.com/opinion/2017/09/13/liberals-sick-alt-left-are-taking-red-pill.html Fox News: "Liberals Sick of the Alt-Left Are Taking 'the Red Pill'" By Elizabeth Ames] September 13, 2017&lt;/ref&gt; 

On November 21, 2017, at the [[Make America Great Again|MAGA]] Rally and Expo in [[Rockford, Illinois]], [[Turning Point USA]] founder [[Charlie Kirk (activist)|Charlie Kirk]] announced her appointment as the organization's director of urban engagement.&lt;ref name="MAGATPIllinois"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.turningpoint.news/maga-illinois-charlie-kirk/|archive-date=May 3, 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180503192025/https://www.turningpoint.news/maga-illinois-charlie-kirk/|title=In Liberal Illinois, TPUSA's Charlie Kirk and Other Speakers Strike a Chord with Conservative Crowds – Turning Point USA News|date=May 3, 2018|access-date=June 13, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Turning Point's hiring of Owens occurred in the wake of allegations of racism at Turning Point.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

In April 2018, [[Kanye West]] tweeted "I love the way Candace Owens thinks."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.thefader.com/2018/04/21/kanye-west-far-right-candace-owens|title=Kanye West Tweets that He Likes the Way Far-Right Personality Candace Owens 'Thinks'|work=[[The FADER]]|access-date=April 22, 2018|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; The tweet was met with derision among some of West's fans.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.thewrap.com/kanye-west-black-lives-candace-owens/|title=Kanye West Applauds Black Lives Matter Critic; Many Fans Revolt: 'This Is So Disturbing'|date=April 21, 2018|work=[[TheWrap]]|access-date=April 22, 2018|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; In May 2018, President [[Donald Trump]] stated that Owens "is having a big impact on politics in our Country. She represents an ever expanding group of very smart 'thinkers,' and it is wonderful to watch and hear the dialogue going on...so good for our Country!"&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://thehill.com/homenews/administration/386857-trump-praises-candace-owens-as-a-very-smart-thinker|title=Trump Praises Conservative Activist Candace Owens as a 'Very Smart Thinker'|last=Shelbourne|first=Mallory|date=May 9, 2018|work=[[TheHill]]|access-date=May 9, 2018|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Owens has appeared on fringe conspiracy websites, such as [[InfoWars]].&lt;ref name=":12" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":2"/&gt;&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt; In 2018, she guest hosted on Fox News.&lt;ref name=":12" /&gt; After finding mainstream success, Owens distanced herself from the far-right conspiracy websites, although she refused to criticize them.&lt;ref name=":12" /&gt;

In May 2018, Owens suggested that "something bio-chemically happens" to women who do not marry or have children, and she linked to the Twitter handles of [[Sarah Silverman]], [[Chelsea Handler]] and [[Kathy Griffin]], saying that they were "evidentiary support" of this theory.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.sfgate.com/entertainment/the-wrap/article/Candace-Owens-Gets-Gently-Dunked-on-by-Sarah-12922930.php|title=Candace Owens Gets Gently Dunked on by Sarah Silverman over 'Women Who Don’t Marry' Tweet|work=SFGate|access-date=May 18, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://finance.yahoo.com/news/sarah-silverman-responds-conservatives-suggestion-single-women-without-children-bio-chemically-affected-132926216.html?guccounter=1|title=Sarah Silverman Responds to Conservative's Suggestion That Single Women Without Children Are 'Bio-Chemically' Affected|access-date=May 18, 2018|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; Silverman responded, saying "It seems to me that by tweeting this, you would like to maybe make us feel badly. I'd say this is evidenced by ur effort to use our twitter handles so we would see. My heart breaks for you, Candy. I hope you find happiness in whatever form that takes."&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Owens responded, accusing Silverman of supporting terrorists and crime gangs.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

==Political views==
===Ideology===
''The Guardian'' has described Owens as "ultra-conservative",&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{Cite|url=https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2018/may/09/trump-candace-owens-very-smart-thinker|title=Trump Praises Controversial Pundit Candace Owens as a 'Very Smart Thinker'|last=Lartey|first=Jamiles|date=May 9, 2018|newspaper=The Guardian|language=en|access-date=May 18, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; and ''New York'' magazine and the ''Columbia Journalism Review'' have described her as "right-wing".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://nymag.com/selectall/2018/04/why-kanye-west-endorsed-candace-owens.html|title=Kanye West, Galaxy Brain|last=Feldman|first=Brian|newspaper=New York Magazine|date=April 23, 2018 |access-date=May 18, 2018|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.cjr.org/the_media_today/chozick-hillary-farrow.php|title=Politics Meet Publishing in Vooks by Chozick, Farrow, Goldberg, Tapper|work=Columbia Journalism Review|first1=Pete |last1=Vernon |date=April 24, 2018|access-date=May 18, 2018|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''The Daily Beast'' has called her views "far-right" and the ''Pacific Standard'' called her a member of the "[[alt-right]]",&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://psmag.com/social-justice/why-is-kanye-west-sounding-like-the-alt-right|title=Why Is Kanye West Sounding Like the Alt-Right?|publisher=Pacific Standard|date=April 27, 2018|first1=Hanif |last1=Abdurraqib}}&lt;/ref&gt; though she has rejected both terms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite tweet |user=realcandaceo |number=987767992493707264 |date=April 21, 2018 |title=Far right?

=== 2017 onward support of Donald Trump ===
In 2017, Owens began describing herself as a conservative Trump supporter.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://atlantablackstar.com/2018/05/19/trick-candace-owens-headed-anti-trump-publication-less-two-years-ago-report-reveals/|title=Is This a Trick?

Owens has since characterized Trump as the "savior" of Western civilization.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; She has argued that Trump has neither engaged in rhetoric that is harmful to African Americans nor proposed policies that would harm African Americans.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

=== Race relations ===
Owens is known for her criticism of [[Black Lives Matter]].&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.dailydot.com/layer8/candace-owens/|title=Who Is Candace Owens, Kanye West's Favorite New Thinker?|date=May 14, 2018|work=The Daily Dot|access-date=May 18, 2018|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":7"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2018/04/27/arts/music/kanye-west-trump-conservatives.html|title=In Kanye West, the Right Sees Truth-Telling and a Rare A-List Ally|date=April 27, 2018|work=The New York Times|access-date=May 18, 2018|language=en-US|issn=0362-4331}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.vox.com/identities/2018/5/2/17311286/kanye-west-slavery-comments-tmz|title=The Ignorance of Kanye West|work=Vox|access-date=May 18, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; She has described Black Lives Matter protesters as "a bunch of whiny toddlers, pretending to be oppressed for attention."&lt;ref name=":9"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2018/04/22/kanye-wests-embrace-of-a-black-trump-supporter-not-well-received/|title=Analysis {{!}} Kanye West's Embrace of a Black Trump Supporter Not Well-Received|last=Scott|first=Eugene|date=April 22, 2018|work=The Washington Post|access-date=May 18, 2018|language=en-US|issn=0190-8286}}&lt;/ref&gt; Owens has argued that African Americans have a "victim mentality" and often refers to the Democratic Party as a "plantation".&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; She has argued that the American left "like black people to be government-dependent".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.news.com.au/finance/work/leaders/i-love-the-way-candace-owens-thinks-kanye-west-praises-conservative-activist-on-twitter/news-story/3a8b33f86ea6ff3f78e701ee0f504159|title='I Love the Way Candace Owens Thinks'|work=NewsComAu|access-date=May 18, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Owens has argued that black people have been brainwashed to vote for Democrats.&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt; She has argued that police violence against black people is not about racism.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt; According to ''The Guardian'' and ''The Daily Beast'', Owens has referred to police killings of black people as a trivial matter to African Americans.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; She has characterized abortion as a tool for "the extermination' of black babies."&lt;ref name=":12"/&gt;

After the 2017 [[Unite the Right rally]] in [[Charlottesville, Virginia]], Owens said that concern over rising white nationalism was “stupid”.&lt;ref name=":12" /&gt;

=== Climate change ===
Owens rejects the [[scientific opinion on climate change|scientific consensus on climate change]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.stanforddaily.com/2018/05/29/tpusa-representatives-talk-identity-politics-trump-and-data/|title=TPUSA Representatives Talk Identity Politics, Trump and Empirical Evidence|date=May 30, 2018|work=The Stanford Daily|access-date=June 17, 2018|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":12" /&gt; She has called climate change a lie used to "extract dollars from Americans."&lt;ref name=":12" /&gt;

=== Me Too movement ===
Owens described the [[Me Too movement]]&amp;nbsp;– which is an international movement against [[sexual harassment]] and [[assault]]&amp;nbsp;– as "stupid" and said that she "hated" the movement.&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.thedailybeast.com/conservatives-turn-on-candace-owens-kanye-wests-favorite-republican|title=Conservatives Turn on Candace Owens, Kanye West's Favorite Republican|last=Sommer|first=Will|date=June 13, 2018|work=The Daily Beast|access-date=June 13, 2018|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":10"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2018/06/17/us/politics/women-conservative-trump.html|title=At Conservative Women's Conference, a Safe Space for Trumpism|last=Herndon|first=Astead W.|access-date=June 17, 2018|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Owens wrote that it was premised on the idea that "women are stupid, weak &amp; inconsequential."&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":10" /&gt; She has repeatedly criticized feminism.&lt;ref name="The Lost Boys The young men of the alt-right could define American politics for a generation"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2017/12/brotherhood-of-losers/544158/|title=The Lost Boys: The Young Men of the Alt-Right Could Define American Politics for a Generation|last=Nagle|first=Angela|date=December 2017|work=The Atlantic|quote=Candace Owens, a popular young black conservative also known as Red Pill Black, has mastered new media platforms, but in service of advocating for something closer to a traditional strain of conservatism: She’s critical of the press, feminism, and open borders, but supports gay marriage}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Dispute with Mollie Tibbetts' family ===
In August 2018, Owens had a dispute with a cousin of [[Killing of Mollie Tibbetts|Mollie Tibbetts]]. Mollie was murdered, allegedly by Cristhian Bahena Rivera, an illegal alien working under a false name who was arrested and charged with Mollie's murder and who subsequently led investigators of the Poweshiek County Sheriff's Office to Mollie's body.&lt;ref name=":13"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://uk.businessinsider.com/turning-point-usa-iowa-charlie-kirk-candace-owens-mollie-tibbetts-event-2018-8?r=UK&amp;IR=T|title=Members of a Conservative Student Group Apologize to Charlie Kirk, Candace Owens over 'Misunderstanding' on Mollie Tibbetts Event|work=Business Insider|access-date=August 27, 2018|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Tibbetts' cousin criticized Owens saying she exploited Tibbetts' death and used Tibbetts' death as "political propaganda."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.thisisinsider.com/mollie-tibbetts-death-republicans-pushing-immigration-2018-8|title=Mollie Tibbetts' Twitter Shows She Was a Strong Feminist and Clinton Supporter.

=== Promoting conspiracy theories about October 2018 bombing attempts ===
In October 2018, during the [[October 2018 United States mail bombing attempts|bombing attempts targeting prominent Democrats]], Owens promoted the conspiracy theory that the bomb mailings were sent by leftists.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.businessinsider.com/clinton-obama-cnn-bombs-democrats-conservatives-rush-limbaugh-2018-10|title=Prominent conservative activists and talking heads are promoting a conspiracy theory that Democrats sent explosive devices to Clinton, Obama, and Soros|last=Relman|first=Eliza|date=October 24, 2018|publisher=Business Insider|accessdate=October 30, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; After authorities arrested a 56-year-old suspect who is a registered Republican and Trump supporter on October 26, Owens deleted her comments without explanation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.dailydot.com/layer8/candace-owens-deletes-bomber-false-flag-tweet/|title=Candace Owens under fire for deleting bomb threat conspiracy tweet|last=Gilmour|first=David|date=October 26, 2018|publisher=The Daily Dot|accessdate=October 30, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Blexit movement===
In October 2018, Owens launched the Blexit movement, a campaign to encourage [[African Americans]] to abandon the Democratic Party and register as Republicans. The term Blexit—a [[portmanteau]] of “[[Black people|black]]" and "exit”—mimics [[Brexit]], the word used to describe the United Kingdom's [[withdrawal from the European Union]]. On the launch, Owens said that her "dear friend and fellow superhero [[Kanye West]]" designed merchandise for the movement, but the following day, West denied being the designer and disavowed the effort, saying "I never wanted any association with Blexit" and "I've been used to spread messages I don't believe in."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://thehill.com/blogs/in-the-know/in-the-know/413953-kanye-west-denies-he-designed-blexit-shirts-ive-been-used|title=Kanye West denies he designed 'Blexit' shirts: 'I've been used'|last=Anapol|first=Avery|date=October 30, 2018|work=TheHill|access-date=October 30, 2018|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-news/kanye-west-candace-owens-blexit-and-politics-749784/|title=Kanye West Distances Himself From Alt-Right Provocateur Candace Owens|last=Klinkenberg|first=Brendan|date=October 30, 2018|work=Rolling Stone|access-date=October 30, 2018|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.theweek.co.uk/97400/what-is-blexit |title=What is Blexit? |publisher=The Week UK |date=October 29, 2018 |accessdate=October 31, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Shortly after the launch, ''The Daily Beast'' found that approximately 16 percent of the total tweets using the #blexit hashtag were from Twitter accounts associated with the promotion of Russian disinformation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.thedailybeast.com/russian-propaganda-veterans-push-candace-owens-blexit-campaign|title=Exclusive: Russian Propaganda Veterans Push Candace Owens’ ‘Blexit’|last=Sommer|first=Kevin Poulsen{{!}}Will|date=November 3, 2018|work=The Daily Beast|access-date=November 5, 2018|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1513">'''The Catholic Campaign for America''' (CCA) is a Roman Catholic activist organization founded in 1989 by Thomas V. Wykes, Jr., "who wanted to address the moral crisis in America with a Catholic response". 

In 1991, Wykes gathered together several notable Catholic leaders in [[Washington, D.C.]], who constituted the CCA's first Board. They included [[William Bennett]], [[Robert Bork|Mary Ellen Bork]], Bishop [[René Henry Gracida]], and the now-deceased [[Hugh Carey]] (former Governor of New York). According to the ''[[National Catholic Register]]'', the CCA was initiated to ''"bring a politically powerful and distinctively Catholic voice to the U.S. political scene"''.

Wykes is also the founding president of [http://www.springtimeoffaith.org Springtime of Faith Foundation], headquartered in [[Nashville, Tennessee]].

==Motto==
"The Gospel of Jesus Christ is not a private opinion, a remote spiritual ideal, or a mere program for spiritual growth. The Gospel is the power to transform the world."

'''Croatian Pure Party of Rights''' ({{lang-hr|Hrvatska čista stranka prava}} or '''HČSP''') is a [[far-right]] political party in [[Croatia]] founded in 1992. The party claims to be an ideological descendant of the identically named right-wing historical party which was active in the early 20th century and which advocated the [[Self-determination|right to self-determination]] for Croatia at the time when the country was part of [[Austria-Hungary]] and [[Kingdom of Yugoslavia]].

In the [[Croatian parliamentary election, 2011]], a coalition consisting of [[Croatian Party of Rights dr. Ante Starčević]] and Croatian Pure Party of Rights won one [[parliamentary seat]], held by [[Ruža Tomašić]] from HSP-AS.&lt;ref name="dnevnik.hr"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://odluka2011.dnevnik.hr/clanak/vijesti/ekskluzivno-rezultati-izlaznih-anketa.html | language = Serbo-Croatian | title = Kukuriku osigurao apsolutnu većinu sa 80 mandata, HDZ ih osvaja 47 | publisher = Dnevnik.hr | accessdate = 2011-05-28 | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20111206014613/http://odluka2011.dnevnik.hr/clanak/vijesti/ekskluzivno-rezultati-izlaznih-anketa.html | archivedate = 2011-12-06 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

The original HČSP was founded in 1904 by the Kvaternik and other factions of the Croatian Party of Rights (HSP), calling on the tradition of one of the ''Frankovci'', a historical right-wing fraction movement of the [[Party of Rights (1861-1929)|Party of Rights]] from late 19th and early 20th century. Like most right-wing parties in [[Croatia]], the HČSP claim a legacy descending from [[Ante Starčević]].&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://hcsp.hr/program|title=Program - HČSP – Hrvatska čista stranka prava|website=www.hcsp.hr|access-date=2017-03-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hidra.hr/strankee/programi/028409e.htm History and Program]{{Dead link|date=November 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The party was reconstituted in 1992.

==Ideology==

The party supports the legacy of the [[Ustaše|Ustaša]], [[Independent State of Croatia|Independent State of Croatia (NDH)]], and its leader [[Ante Pavelić]]. The official HČSP website features celebrations of Pavelić's 120th birthday, and the party members expressed loyalty to him by laying flowers on the grave of his parents, and attending church mass in honor of Pavelić.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.slobodnadalmacija.hr/novosti/hrvatska/clanak/id/163359/clanovi-hcsp-a-polozili-vijence-na-grob-pavelicevih-roditelja--miljak-najavio-mimohod-nacionalista-kroz-zagreb|title=Članovi HČSP-a položili vijence na grob Pavelićevih roditelja - Miljak najavio mimohod nacionalista kroz Zagreb|last=|first=|date=2012-04-10|work=[[Slobodna Dalmacija]]|language=Serbo-Croatian|archive-url=https://www.webcitation.org/6mb304mhg?url=http://www.slobodnadalmacija.hr/novosti/hrvatska/clanak/id/163359/clanovi-hcsp-a-polozili-vijence-na-grob-pavelicevih-roditelja--miljak-najavio-mimohod-nacionalista-kroz-zagreb|archive-date=2016-12-08|access-date=2016-02-18|via=|deadurl=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Luka Podrug, candidate of the [[Croatian Democratic Union|HDZ]]-led coalition for the parliamentary elections 2015, expressed admiration for the Ustaše. He has also publicly admitted that he is "responsible" for Ustasha salute "[[Za dom spremni]]" on the monument to fallen members of the [[Croatian Defence Forces|HOS]] in [[Split, Croatia|Split]]. At the Split cemetery on April 10, 2006, he celebrated the establishment of NDH saying that it is a "day that every normal Croat respects and celebrates, as a day comparable to their child's birthday"&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Milanović: U HDZ-ovoj koaliciji su obožavatelji Ante Pavelića|url = http://faktograf.hr/2015/11/05/milanovic-u-hdz-ovoj-koaliciji-su-obozavatelji-ante-pavelica/|website = Faktograf.hr|access-date = 2016-02-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Party policy would introduce [[lustration]] to the [[Croatia]]n system, and would also cease cooperation with the [[International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia]]. The party opposes [[Accession of Croatia to the European Union|the EU]] and [[NATO]] membership.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt;

Internal policies would include banning [[abortion]] and not allowing same-sex marriages. [[Amnesty]] given to [[Serbs of Croatia|Serbs]] who participated in [[Republic of Serbian Krajina|the rebellion]], as well as the return of [[Serbs]], would be cancelled.&lt;ref name="autogenerated2"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://hcsp.hr/protiv-ulaska-u-eu-nato-i-povratka-srba|title=HČSP – Hrvatska čista stranka prava|website=www.hcsp.hr|access-date=2017-03-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Regional Representation==
HČSP contested local elections in [[Split (city)|Split]] and [[Split-Dalmatia County]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.izbori.hr/arhiva/arhiva2005Lokalni/rezultati/Z17_SPLITSKO-DALMATINSKA.pdf{{dead link|date=December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==2007 election and accusations of antisemitism==
The party announced that it would spend 600,000 [[kuna (currency)|kuna]] for the campaign.&lt;ref name=autogenerated2 /&gt; The youngest person competing in the 2007 elections, [[Kristina Posavec]] stated she has chosen to be on HČSP list because ''"it is against EU, NATO and gay marriages".''  &lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.li/20071111095413/http://www.rtl.hr/izbori/vijest/12684/ RTL Televizija - Vijesti - RTL s najmlađom i najstarijom kandidatkinjom]&lt;/ref&gt;

In one of the election debates, former party leader [[Josip Miljak]] stated that the "profit of [[INA (company)|INA]] goes to Hungary, to [[MOL Group|MOL]], to the Jewish capital, while we are left only with the pollution." After this statement, [[Croatian People's Party|HNS]]'s [[Goran Beus Richembergh]] and [[Social Democratic Party of Croatia|SDP]]'s [[Tonino Picula]] left the TV studio in protest.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://arhiva.nacional.hr/clanak/39960/picula-iz-protesta-napustio-htv-ovu-emisiju|title=Picula iz protesta napustio HTV-ovu emisiju|first=|date=16 November 2007|publisher=|language=Serbo-Croatian|trans-title=Picula leaves Croatian Radiotelevision show in protest|author=Marijana Zrinjski|accessdate=2012-07-01|archivedate=2012-06-30|archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/68olptUvs?url=http://www.nacional.hr/clanak/39960/picula-iz-protesta-napustio-htv-ovu-emisiju|deadurl=no|work=[[Nacional (weekly)|Nacional]]|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Party was involved in an opposition to [[Zagreb Pride]] demonstrations.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://wwpbehindthephotos.wordpress.com/2010/06/22/zagreb-pride-june-19-2010/|title=Zagreb Pride – June 19, 2010|last=wwpproject|date=2010-06-22|website=WWP: BEHIND THE PHOTOS|access-date=2016-12-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Hong Kong Customs'', originally known as the ''Preventive Service'', was founded in 1909.  Initially it was responsible to collect the newly imposed duties on liquor.  As commodities became subject to duties, the scope of the Preventive Service broadened to include tobacco and hydrocarbon oil, as well as duties related to the government opium monopoly.  During times of war, the service prevented the export of precious metals and other commodities to the enemies of the United Kingdom and its allies.  In 1963, with the passage of the Preventive Service Ordinance, the service gained the legal status to make regulations on its discipline, functions, powers and terms of service. In 1977, it was renamed the ''Hong Kong Customs and Excise Service''.  On 1 August 1982, ''The Hong Kong Customs and Excise Department'' became independent from the [[Trade and Industry Department]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title = Milestones of HK Customs in the past 100 years (HK Customs News, Issue 39, May 2009, page 1-4) |url = http://www.customs.gov.hk/filemanager/common/pdf/pdf_publications/new/issue39_e.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The C&amp;ED is an active member of the World Customs Organization (WCO) and the Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC). It exchanges intelligence and works closely with overseas Customs administrations and law enforcement agencies.  

With a view to tackling cybercrime, Hong Kong Customs established the Computer Forensic Laboratory, the Computer Analysis &amp; Response Team, and the Anti-Internet Piracy Investigation Team in 2000.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title = HKUST Press Release (29.6.2000) |url = https://www.ust.hk/press_release_archive/eng/news/archive/e_pa000629-173.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title = CED Commissioner's Speech (25.4.2001) |url = https://www.customs.gov.hk/en/publication_press/speeches/index_id_43.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title = World Customs Organization Photo Competition Year 2013 (page 16 - The LAB) |url = http://www.wcoomd.org/en/about-us/annual-competitions/~/media/WCO/Public/Global/PDF/About%20us/Annual%20Competitions/Photo%20Competition%202013.ashx}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title = CED PINE Issue 6 (April 2006)(page 1) |url = http://www.customs.gov.hk/filemanager/common/pdf/pdf_publications/pine/pak06.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title = HKU Faculty List (DR Michael Kwan) |url = http://www.ecom-icom.hku.hk/About/Faculty}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title = Apple Daily News (14.10.2005) |url = https://hk.news.appledaily.com/local/daily/article/20051014/5309631}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title = International Professional Security Association (Hong Kong Event)(4 December 2018) |url = http://www.ipsa.com.hk/announce-ipsa-hk-activities}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title = International Conference on Digital Forensics and Investigation (Beijing 2012)(Keynote Speaker) |url = http://secmeeting.ihep.ac.cn/Keynote.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title = South China Morning Post (22.3.2018) |url = http://www.scmp.com/news/hong-kong/law-crime/article/2138287/online-piracy-clampdown-hong-kong-deprives-errant-websites}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title = Apple Daily News (3.10.2017) |url = https://hk.news.appledaily.com/local/realtime/article/20171003/57285282}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title = Oriental Daily News (21.3.2018) |url = http://orientaldaily.on.cc/cnt/news/20180321/mobile/odn-20180321-0321_00176_024.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title = American Chamber of Commerce (Hong Kong Event)(14.6.2017) |url = https://amchamhk.eventbank.com/event/5691/#}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title = CED PINE Issue 11 (November 2007)(page 12) |url = http://www.customs.gov.hk/filemanager/common/pdf/pdf_publications/pine/pak11.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title = World Customs Organization Newsroom (3.9.2013) |url = http://www.wcoomd.org/en/media/newsroom/2013/september/wco-regional-workshop-on-computer-forensics-in-hong-kong.aspx}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title = Apple Daily News (16.12.2006) |url = http://hk.apple.nextmedia.com/news/art/20061216/6626769}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title = HK Government Specialized Service Award 2007 (page 4) |url = http://www.csb.gov.hk/english/info/files/annex070913e.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title = Winston Churchill Memorial Trust Report on Electronic Crime Management Models (2009) |url = https://www.churchilltrust.com.au/media/fellows/TAYLOR%2C_Duncan_2008.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title = HK Government Report on Computer Related Crime (September 2000) |url = https://www.infosec.gov.hk/english/useful/files/ComputerRelatedCrime_eng.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title = World Trade Organization WTO (HK Government Report 27.10.2010)(page 21) |url = https://www.tid.gov.hk/english/trade_relations/tradefora/files/hkc_govt_report.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title = World Trade Organization WTO (HK Government Report 1.10.2014)(page 17) |url = https://www.wto.org/english/tratop_e/tpr_e/g306_e.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title = World Trade Organization WTO Report (1.10.2014)(page 62-64) |url = https://www.wto.org/english/tratop_e/tpr_e/s306_e.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title = Taiwan Intellectual Property Office TIPO Report 2005 |url = https://www.tipo.gov.tw/public/Attachment/322614373576.doc}}&lt;/ref&gt;    These specialized establishments prominently enhanced Customs' enforcement capability and the credibility of digital evidence presented to the courts.

==Protection of revenue==
There is no tariff on goods entering Hong Kong, but excise duties are charged on four groups of commodities. These commodities are hydrocarbon oil, liquor, methyl alcohol and tobacco. These duties make no differentiation between imported commodities, or commodities manufactured locally for domestic consumption.

In 2003, the C&amp;ED collected $6,484 million excise duty. Under the Dutiable Commodities Ordinance, the C&amp;ED controls breweries, distilleries, tobacco factories, oil installations, ship and aircraft duty-free stores, and industrial and commercial establishments dealing with dutiable commodities; and supervises licensed, general bonded and public bonded warehouses.

Licences are issued to those who import, export, manufacture or store dutiable commodities. The C&amp;ED also assesses the First Registration Tax of vehicles under the Motor Vehicle (First Registration Tax) Ordinance. The Anti-illicit Cigarette Investigation Division is specially tasked to detect syndicated smuggling, distribution and peddling of dutiable cigarettes. The Diesel Oil Enforcement Division focuses its efforts on detecting the smuggling and misuse of illicit fuels.

==Prevention and detection of smuggling==
The C&amp;ED prevents and detects smuggling activities under the Import and Export Ordinance and enforces the licensing controls on prohibited articles by inspecting cargoes imported and exported by air, sea and land; processing passengers and their baggage at entry /exit points; and searching aircraft, vessels and vehicles entering and leaving Hong Kong. The Joint Police/Customs Anti-Smuggling Task Force is dedicated to combating smuggling activities by sea. The Control Points Investigation Division is tasked to strengthen the intelligence collection capability at the land boundary and suppress the cross-boundary smuggling activities.

==Airport==
{{Main|Hong Kong International Airport}}
The Hong Kong International Airport is one of the busiest airports in the world with a daily arrival of about 257 scheduled flights, bringing into Hong Kong a daily average of 25,989 passengers and 2,838 tonnes of imported cargoes. In 2003, the throughput of air passengers was 19 million whereas the throughput of air cargoes was about 2.64 million tonnes.

== Harbour ==
{{Main|Port of Hong Kong}}

Hong Kong is one of the busiest container ports in the world. It handled 20.4 million TEUs (20-foot equivalent units) in 2003. Of these, 12.1 million TEUs were handled at the Kwai Chung Container Terminal. In 2003, 70,910 ocean-going ships and 365,190 coastal vessels entered and left Hong Kong.

Ships and vessels are subject to customs check. Cargoes are either examined on board sea freighters or after off-loading.

In 2003, a total of 8.6 million passengers arrived in Hong Kong from the Mainland and Macau by sea and by helicopters. They were processed at the China Ferry Terminal in Tsim Sha Tsui and the Hong Kong-Macau Ferry Terminal in Central. In addition, a daily average of 49 helicopter flights between Hong Kong and Macau are operated at the Hong Kong-Macau Ferry Terminal. Four Customs launches conduct maritime patrol in the territorial waters round the clock whereas four high-speed pursuit crafts and two shallow water patrol launches are employed to carry out interception at sea.

==Land boundary==
On average, 156,339 passengers arrive from the Mainland by land daily and they are processed at Man Kam To, Sha Tau Kok, Lok Ma Chau and Lo Wu control points. Additionally, 2,991 passengers enter Hong Kong by through-trains and are processed at Hung Hom Railway Station. Goods imported by road are checked at Man Kam To, Sha Tau Kok and Lok Ma Chau. In 2003, over 20 million tonnes of cargoes were imported through the land boundary control points.

==Border control points==
* '''Man Kam To''' – custom station handling autos and lorries; 4-lane bridge across Shenzhen River
* '''Sha Tau Kok''' – customer station handling autos and lorries
* '''Lok Ma Chau''' – large custom station handling auto and lorries; multi-lane bridge across Shenzhen
* '''[[Hong Kong China Ferry Terminal]]''', Tsim Sha Tsui
* '''[[Hong Kong-Macau Ferry Terminal, Hong Kong|Hong Kong-Macau Ferry Terminal]]'''
* '''[[Hong Kong International Airport]]'''

==Anti-drug operations==
The C&amp;ED and the [[Hong Kong Police|Hong Kong Police Force]] (HKPF) are responsible for anti-drug law enforcement. Seizures of illicit drugs in 2003 included 52.87 kilograms of heroin, 562.15 kilograms of herbal cannabis, 24.46 kilograms of cannabis resin, 8.33 kilograms of cocaine, 41.1 kilograms and 1,272 tablets of methylamphetamine, 35.56 kilograms and 141,038 tablets of ecstasy-type tablets (MDMA, etc.), 51.3 kilograms and 238 tablets of ketamine, and substantial quantities of various narcotics, analgesics and tranquillisers.

A total of 8,652 persons were arrested for drug offences of whom 2,827 were arrested for major offences such as drug trafficking and manufacturing, and the remaining 5,825 were arrested for minor offences such as possession of illicit drugs.

Apart from intercepting smuggling of drugs at entry/exit control points, the department launches proactive investigations and surveillance operations on syndicated drug trafficking activities throughout Hong Kong. The department also flexibly deploys drug detector dogs and introduces advanced technologies, such as Mobile X-ray Vehicle Scanning Systems and Vehicle X-ray Inspection Systems, to assist anti-drug work.

In addition, the department closely monitors the trend of illicit drug use, in particular the growing popularity of psychotropic substances among the young and cross boundary drug crimes. The C&amp;ED also investigates laundering of drug proceeds and initiates applications for freezing and confiscating assets derived from drug trafficking. Suspected drug-related assets worth $1.18 million were frozen, awaiting confiscation proceedings.

The department enforces a licensing system to control the import, export and dealing of 25 specific precursor chemicals which can be used for the manufacture of dangerous drugs. It exchanges intelligence and co-operates closely with the HKPF and various drug enforcement agencies on the Mainland and overseas in the fight against drug traffickers both locally and at international level.

==Trade controls and consumer protection==
The C&amp;ED safeguards the certification and licensing systems which are of vital importance to Hong Kong's trading integrity. The department deters and investigates offences of origin fraud, circumvention of textiles licensing and quota control. It also investigates offences of import and export of strateg commodities and other prohibited articles not under and in accordance with a licence.

The department carries out cargo examination at control points, factory inspections, factory audit checks and consignment checks. It is also the department's enforcement strategy to administer a monetary reward scheme to encourage the supply of information on textile origin fraud.

The department is a member of the Hong Kong Compliance Office set up to assist the Central People's Government in implementing the Chemical Weapons Convention in Hong Kong. The department enforces licensing control on rice and consumer protection legislation relating to weights and measures, markings on fineness of precious metals, and safety of toys, children's products and consumer goods. The department also verifies import and export declarations to ensure accurate trade statistics and assesses and collects declaration charges and the clothing industry training levy.

In 2002/03, the department collected $848 million in declaration charges and $19.9 million in clothing industry training levies.

==Intellectual property rights protection==
The C&amp;ED has the mission to defend the interests of intellectual property rights owners and legitimate traders through staunch enforcement of the Copyright Ordinance, the Trade Descriptions Ordinance and the Prevention of Copyright Piracy Ordinance.

The department investigates and prosecutes copyright offences relating to literary, dramatic, musical and artistic works, sound recordings, cinematographic films, broadcasts and other published works under the Copyright Ordinance. It also takes enforcement action against commercial goods with forged trademark or false label under the Trade Descriptions Ordinance.

At the manufacture level, the Prevention of Copyright Piracy Ordinance requires local optical disc and stamper manufacturers to obtain licences from the department and mark on all their products specific identification codes. The Import and Export Ordinance imposes licensing controls on the import and export of optical disc mastering and replication equipment. A 147-strong Special Task Force has also been playing an important role in combating copyright piracy, and serves as a mobile brigade to reinforce the suppression of other customs-related crimes.

==Customs co-operation==
The C&amp;ED is an active member of the World Customs Organization (WCO) and Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC). It exchanges intelligence and works closely with overseas customs administrations and law enforcement agencies. The department has also entered bilateral Cooperative Arrangements with other customs authorities on administrative assistance. At the working level, the department and the Mainland customs have each established designated liaison officers to facilitate the exchange of intelligence through direct telephone hotlines.

==Seizures and prosecutions==
In 2003, the C&amp;ED seized a total of $1,244 million worth of goods. They included illicit drugs valued at $45 million; infringing goods worth $229 million; counterfeit goods worth $120 million; smuggled merchandises worth $541 million; dutiable commodities worth $284 million.

During the year, the C&amp;ED prosecuted 7,184 persons and firms under various laws enforced by the department.

Fines amounted to $31.83 million and 4,351 custodial sentences, aggregated to 1,671 years and 11 months, were imposed on convicted persons. Among the prosecutions, 803 were cases relating to unlawful commercial malpractices such as violation of licensing controls of strategic commodities, supplying false information in applications for certificate of origin, textile licensing frauds and contravention of consumer protection legislation.

==Ranks==
As with all of the HK Disciplined Services, British-pattern ranks and insignia continue to be utilised, the only change being the exchange of the St. Edward's Crown for the [[Bauhinia]] flower crest post-1997. 

* Commissioner (similar insignia to a UK General)
* Deputy Commissioner (similar insignia to a UK [[Lieutenant-General]])
* Assistant Commissioner (similar insignia to a UK [[Major-General]])
* Chief Superintendent (similar insignia to a UK [[Colonel]])
* Senior Superintendent (similar insignia to a UK [[Lieutenant-Colonel]])
* Superintendent (similar insignia to a UK Major)
* Assistant Superintendent (similar insignia to a UK [[Captain (land)|Captain]])
* Senior Inspector (similar insignia to a UK Lieutenant with a bar beneath)
* Inspector (similar insignia to a UK Lieutenant)
* Probationary Inspector (similar insignia to a UK [[Second Lieutenant]])
* Chief Customs Officer (Wreathed fouled anchor)
* Senior Customs Officer (Three chevrons)
* Customs Officer (ID number)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title = CED official website (RANKS)|url = http://www.customs.gov.hk/en/about_us/grades/ces/rank/index.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Crest ==
The current crest of the force was adopted in 1997 to replace most of the colonial symbols:
* [[St Edward's Crown]] replaced with Bauhinia
* Laurel wreath is added to replace the colonial [[Brunswick star]]
* Motto changed from "Customs Hong Kong to Hong Kong Customs and Excise 香港海關
* Badge theme added with key and sword to replace the words "香港海關"

== Weapons ==
The C&amp;E officers are trained in the use of, and issued when required, revolvers as sidearms for lethal protection and an ASP expendable baton and Sabre Red pepper spray for less-than-lethal options on the field as same as the other disciplinary force members. Semi-automatic pistols are issued to the section tasked with providing witness protection. Members are also trained in the use of shotguns and sub-machine guns, however such long arms are rarely used. 

Officers are required to go to the range at least twice a year after their graduation. While most members of the HK CED are not routinely armed, the personnel that do routinely carry sidearms are those staff responsible for dealing with serious crimes, anti-narcotics and armed escort stationed at the various ports, along with the members of the Special Task Force.

* [[Smith &amp; Wesson Model 10]]- Standard issue sidearm for all CED officers, 6 shot .38 revolver. 
* [[Glock 19]] – Standard issue pistol of the section of providing witness protection, loaded with 15 round 9mm parabellum magazines 
* [[Remington 870]]- Standard issue shotgun, loaded with 12 Gauge rounds
* [[Heckler &amp; Koch MP5]]- Standard issue SMG, loaded with 30 round of 9mm parabellum magazines

The '''Czechoslovak government-in-exile''', sometimes styled officially as the '''Provisional Government of Czechoslovakia''' ([[Czech Language|Czech]]: ''Prozatímní státní zřízení československé''), was an informal title conferred upon the '''Czechoslovak National Liberation Committee''', initially by [[British government|British]] [[diplomatic recognition]]. The name came to be used by other [[Allies of World War II|World War II Allies]] as they subsequently recognised it. The Committee was originally created by the former Czechoslovak President, [[Edvard Beneš]] in [[Paris]], France, in October 1939.&lt;ref name=Crampton&gt;Crampton, R. J. ''Eastern Europe in the Twentieth Century – and after''. Routledge. 1997.&lt;/ref&gt; Unsuccessful negotiations with France for diplomatic status, as well as the impending [[Occupation of France by Nazi Germany|Nazi occupation of France]], forced the Committee to withdraw to [[London]] in 1940. The Czechoslovak Government-in-Exile offices were at various locations in London but mainly at a building called Fursecroft.

It was the legitimate government for [[Occupation of Czechoslovakia by Nazi Germany|Czechoslovakia]] throughout the [[Second World War]].&lt;ref name=End/&gt; A specifically anti-Fascist government, it sought to reverse the [[Munich Agreement]] and the subsequent [[Occupation of Czechoslovakia by Nazi Germany|German occupation of Czechoslovakia]], and to return the Republic to its 1937 boundaries. As such it was ultimately considered, by those countries that recognised it, the legal continuation of the [[First Republic of Czechoslovakia]].

==From committee to government==

Seeing the end of the Republic as a ''fait accompli'', [[Edvard Beneš]] resigned as president of the [[First Republic of Czechoslovakia|First Czechoslovak Republic]] one week after the [[Munich Agreement]] ceded the [[Sudetenland]] to [[Nazi Germany]]. He initially fled to London (→ [[Edvard Beneš#Second exile|Second exile]]). On 15 February 1939, he arrived in Chicago; he became visiting professor at the [[University of Chicago]],&lt;ref&gt;[[Chicago Tribune]]: [http://archives.chicagotribune.com/1939/02/15/page/2/article/benes-to-arrive-today-for-u-c-lecture-series Benes to arrive today for U C lecture series]&lt;/ref&gt; where he took refuge in the same community that had once buoyed his predecessor and friend, [[Tomáš Masaryk]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bookrags.com/biography/edward-benes/|title=Edward Benes Biography|website=www.bookrags.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; While there, he was urged to quickly return to Europe to organize some kind of government-in-exile. He therefore returned to Europe in July to live in Paris along with several other key players in his former administration. After [[World War II]] formally began, the group became known as the Czech National Liberation Committee, and immediately began to seek international recognition as the exiled government of Czechoslovakia. By the end of 1939, though, France and Britain had extended it the right to conclude international treaties – France on 13 November and Britain on 20 December 1939&lt;ref name=End&gt;[Musil, Jírí. ''The End of Czechoslovakia''. Central European University Press. 2000. 181–186.&lt;/ref&gt; – but did not yet see those treaties as having been concluded in the name of the Czechoslovak Republic.

[[File:Edvard Beneš.jpg|thumb|left|upright=.75|[[Edvard Beneš]], leader of the Czechoslovak government-in-exile]]
It was in fact France itself that proved the greatest obstacle to accepting the Committee as a full [[government-in-exile]]. The government of [[Édouard Daladier]]&lt;ref name="dala"&gt;it was Daladiers fifth government, see [[:fr:Gouvernement Édouard Daladier (5)]]&lt;/ref&gt; was ambivalent towards the ambitions of the Committee and of Czechoslovakia in general. Though he had publicly seen the [[appeasement of Hitler]] as the road to war, Daladier ultimately capitulated to the wishes of [[Neville Chamberlain]]. After the war came, he and his government dithered over whether the Soviet or [[Nazi]] threat was the greater. Likewise, though he extended recognition to the Committee as a non-governmental agency, his government was non-committal to Beneš himself, and saw many possibilities for a post-war Czechoslovakia. One of its principal reservations about giving governmental status to Beneš, was the fact of the murky situation in the then-independent [[Slovak Republic (1939–1945)|Slovakia]] (which was a satellite state of the German Empire). The French government of the winter of 1939/40&lt;ref name="dala"/&gt; felt that Beneš was not necessarily speaking for all Czechoslovaks, based on the relatively fluid situation in Slovakia. France's diplomacy towards Beneš was therefore agile. It avoided any direct expression of support for the Beneš Committee's desire to return to the First Republic.&lt;ref name=End/&gt; However, as Beneš was the key to getting military support from the well-trained [[Czechoslovak army]], France was in fact the first nation to conclude a treaty with the Committee. 2 October 1939 agreement between France and Beneš allowed for the reconstitution of the Czechoslovak army on French territory.&lt;ref name=End/&gt; Ultimately, units of the First Division of the Czechoslovak Army fought alongside their hosts in the final stages of the [[Battle of France]].

[[File:Czech_11thBattalion_Tobruk_1941.jpg |thumb|[[Czechoslovak 11th Infantry Battalion|Czechoslovaks]] were fighting alongside Poles and Australians at [[Siege of Tobruk|Tobruk]].]]
It was the failure of the Allied military forces in this battle which most directly helped the ambitions of the Beneš Committee. With the fall of France, the views of the newly appointed prime minister [[Winston Churchill]] took predominance over the concerns of the waning [[Third Republic of France|Third Republic]]. He was very much clearer than his predecessor Chamberlain with respect to Czechoslovak affairs, and quickly recognized Beneš as the president of a government-in-exile after the fall of France. Nevertheless, the Committee still felt somewhat insecure about this recognition, because it specifically mentioned Beneš as president, but did not explicitly link Beneš to the previously-existing government. Thus, they pressed the British in April 1941 for even greater clarity. On the 18th of that month, they sent a letter to the British requesting that their agreements "be concluded, as before September, 1938, in the name of the Czechoslovak Republic". British [[Foreign Minister]] [[Anthony Eden]] gave such assent on 18 July 1941.&lt;ref name=Talmon&gt;Talmon, Stefan. ''Recognition of Governments in International Law with particular reference to governments in exile''. Oxford University Press. 1998. 119.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Allied Soldiers Like London and London Likes Them- Overseas Troops in England, 1940 D1730.jpg|thumb|left|Czechoslovak troops in London in 1940]]
The United States and the Soviet Union were effectively forced to do the same later in the year, as Slovakia declared war on the two countries. With an [[Axis powers|Axis]] government both firmly and formally in place in [[Bratislava]], the only friendly government left to recognize by the later half of 1941 was that of Beneš.&lt;ref name=End/&gt; The remaining legal question was whether the Beneš government was actually a ''continuation'' of the First Republic, or a successor without solid constitutional underpinnings. This doubt was erased by the spring of 1942. Following almost six months of planning behind enemy lines, Czechoslovak Allied operatives in Bohemia fatally wounded [[Reinhard Heydrich]], the dictator at the head of the [[Protectorate of Bohemia and Moravia]]. The success of this mission, [[Operation Anthropoid]], caused Britain and Free France (itself a government-in-exile) to formally repudiate the [[Munich Agreement]], thus conferring ''[[de jure]]'' legitimacy on the Beneš government as the continuation of the First Republic. The government's continued health now depended on Allied military victory.

==Planning for the future==
[[File:La Panne Belgie 1945.jpg|thumb|Troops from the [[1st Czechoslovak Armoured Brigade]], part of the British army, photographed in [[De Panne]] in 1945]]
Beneš hoped for a restoration of the Czechoslovak state in its pre-Munich form after the anticipated Allied victory, a false hope.

Beneš determined to strengthen Czechoslovak security against future German aggression through alliances with Poland and the Soviet Union. The Soviet Union, however, objected to a tripartite Czechoslovak-Polish-Soviet commitment. In December 1943, Beneš's government concluded a treaty with the Soviets.  Beneš's interest in maintaining friendly relations with the Soviet Union was motivated also by his desire to avoid Soviet encouragement of a postwar [[communist]] coup in Czechoslovakia. Beneš worked to bring Czechoslovak communist exiles in the United Kingdom into cooperation with his government, offering far-reaching concessions, including nationalization of heavy industry and the creation of local people's committees at the war's end. In March 1945, he gave key cabinet positions to Czechoslovak communist exiles in Moscow.

===The "German problem"===

During the latter years of the war, Beneš worked toward resolving the German minority problem and received consent from the Allies for a solution based on a postwar transfer of the Sudeten German population.  Especially after the Nazi [[Operation Anthropoid#Consequences|reprisals]] for the assassination of [[Reinhard Heydrich]], most of the [[Czech resistance to Nazi occupation|Czech resistance groups]] demanded, based on German Nazi terror during occupation, the "final solution of the German question" ({{lang-cs|konečné řešení německé otázky}}) which would have to be "solved" by deportation of the ethnic Germans to Germany and Austria.&lt;ref&gt;''Naše geografická situace a historie naší země od 10. století tu může býti všem dostatečným důvodem a dokladem k tomu, že toto konečné řešení německé otázky u nás je naprosto nezbytné, jedině správné a opravdu logické.''[http://www.psp.cz/eknih/1945pns/stenprot/002schuz/s002002.htm]&lt;/ref&gt;

These demands were adopted by the Government-in-Exile, which sought the support of the Allies for this proposal, beginning in 1943.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://psp.cz/eknih/1945pns/stenprot/002schuz/s002002.htm|title=Prozatimní NS RČS 1945-1946, 2. schůze, část 2/4 (28. 10. 1945)|website=psp.cz}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = "Dokumenty"&gt;Československo-sovětské vztahy v diplomatických jednáních 1939–1945. Dokumenty. Díl 2 (červenec 1943 – březen 1945). Praha. 1999. ({{ISBN|808547557X}})&lt;/ref&gt; 
&lt;ref name="Dokumenty"/&gt; The Government-in-Exile promulgated a series of laws that are now referred to as the "[[Beneš decrees]]".  One part of these decrees dealt with the status of ethnic [[German people|Germans]] and [[Hungarian people|Hungarians]] in postwar Czechoslovakia, including the confiscation of their property, anticipating their future [[deportation]] (see [[expulsion of Germans from Czechoslovakia]], and [[Hungarians in Slovakia]]). However, the final agreement authorizing the forced population transfer of the Germans was not reached until 2 August 1945 at the end of the [[Potsdam Conference#Potsdam Agreement|Potsdam Conference]].

==History==
The [[Department of Health (1921–1987)|Department of Health (I)]] was established in 1921 and was the precursor to today's Department of Health.&lt;ref name="NAA CA 17"&gt;{{citation|title=CA 17: Department of Health, Central Office|url=http://naa12.naa.gov.au/scripts/SearchOld.asp?Number=CA+17|publisher=National Archives of Australia|accessdate=15 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first Department of Health was dissolved in 1987, when it was merged with the Department of Community Services to form the Department of Community Services and Health.&lt;ref name=HealthDeptHist&gt;{{citation|url=http://www.health.gov.au/internet/main/publishing.nsf/Content/health-history.htm|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131109190520/http://www.health.gov.au/internet/main/publishing.nsf/Content/health-history.htm|archivedate=9 November 2013|title=History of the Department|publisher=Department of Health|author=Department of Health}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="NAA CA 5985"&gt;{{citation|title=CA 5985: Department of Community Services and Health, Central Office|url=http://naa12.naa.gov.au/scripts/SearchOld.asp?Number=CA+5985|publisher=National Archives of Australia|accessdate=15 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In June 1991, the [[Department of Health, Housing and Community Services]] was formed when housing industry programs were transferred from the [[Department of Industry, Technology and Commerce]].&lt;ref name="NAA CA 7297"&gt;{{citation|title=CA 7297: Department of Health, Housing and Community Services, Central Office|url=http://naa12.naa.gov.au/scripts/SearchOld.asp?Number=CA+7297|publisher=National Archives of Australia|accessdate=15 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; In March 1993 the [[Department of Immigration, Local Government and Ethnic Affairs]] joined with the Department of Health, Housing and Community Services to form the [[Department of Health, Housing, Local Government and Community Services]].&lt;ref name="NAA CA 7660"&gt;{{citation|title=CA 7660: Department of Health, Housing, Local Government and Community Services, Central Office|url=http://naa12.naa.gov.au/scripts/SearchOld.asp?Number=CA+7660|publisher=National Archives of Australia|accessdate=15 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Subsequently, in December 1993, the Department was abolished and replaced with the [[Department of Human Services and Health]].&lt;ref name=HealthDeptHist/&gt;&lt;ref name="NAA CA 7853"&gt;{{citation|title=CA 7853: Department of Human Services and Health, Central Office|url=http://naa12.naa.gov.au/scripts/SearchOld.asp?Number=CA+7853|publisher=National Archives of Australia|accessdate=15 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Also in 1994, the [[Office of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Health]] was established.&lt;ref name=HealthDeptHist/&gt;

After a [[Australian federal election, 1996|new government was elected]] in March 1996, the [[Department of Health and Family Services]] was formed.&lt;ref name=HealthDeptHist/&gt;&lt;ref name="NAA CA 8246"&gt;{{citation|title=CA 8246: Department of Health and Family Services, Central Office|url=http://naa12.naa.gov.au/scripts/SearchOld.asp?Number=CA+8246|publisher=National Archives of Australia|accessdate=15 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The department also had responsibility for the [[Supported Accommodation Assistance Program]] from the former [[Department of Housing and Regional Development]]. Later, the department assumed responsibility for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander health matters from the [[Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission]].&lt;ref name=HealthDeptHist/&gt;

After the [[Australian federal election, 1998|October 1998 election]], the Department was abolished and replaced by the Australian Federal [[Department of Health and Aged Care]], named to reflect new responsibilities and functions.&lt;ref name="NAA CA 8616"&gt;{{citation|title=CA 8616: Department of Health and Aged Care, Central Office|url=http://naa12.naa.gov.au/scripts/SearchOld.asp?Number=CA+8616|publisher=National Archives of Australia|accessdate=15 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Responsibility for Family and Children's Services, Disability Programs and the Commonwealth Rehabilitation Service were transferred to the [[Department of Family and Community Services (Australia)|Department of Family and Community Services]] on 22&amp;nbsp;October&amp;nbsp;1998.&lt;ref name=HealthDeptHist/&gt;

'''The Dzongkha Development Commission''' (&lt;span lang="dz"&gt;རྫོང་ཁ་གོང་འཕེལ་ལྷན་ཚོགས&lt;/span&gt;),  also called the DDC, is the pre-eminent body on matters pertaining to the [[Dzongkha|Dzongkha language]]. The DDC was officially established in 1986 by [[Jigme Singye Wangchuk]], the fourth king of [[Bhutan]], to preserve and promote the use of Dzongkha as the national language of Bhutan. The DDC offices are now located in the Kawajangtsa area of [[Thimphu]], close to the [[National Library of Bhutan]] and the Ministry of Education.

The Dzongkha Development Commission consists of two parts: the Commission itself having nine eminent members (or commissioners) chaired by the [[List of Prime Ministers of Bhutan|Prime Minister of Bhutan]]; and the DDC Secretariat which carries out the day-to-day work of the Commission.

The body has the task of acting as an official authority on the language. It is charged with promoting the use of Dzongkha; researching and publishing official dictionaries and grammar of the language; developing new lexical terminology; and  developing software and fonts to support the language.

[[File:Eurabia map.png|thumb|"Eurabia": the combined area of the European Union current and prospective members, of the European Free Trade Area (except Iceland), of the members and observer states of the Arab League, together with [[State of Israel|Israel]], the territory of which is claimed by [[State of Palestine|Palestine]].]]
'''Eurabia''' is a [[Neologism#Politics|political neologism]], a [[portmanteau]] of [[Europe]] and [[Arabia]], used to describe a [[conspiracy theory]] of [[globalism|globalist]] elements, allegedly led by French and Arab powers, to Islamise and Arabise Europe, thereby weakening its existing culture and undermining a previous alignment with the U.S. and Israel.&lt;ref name="Yeor2"/&gt;&lt;ref name="MarjanSapir"/&gt;

The concept was coined by [[Bat Ye'or]] (pen name of Gisele Littman) in the early 2000s and is described in her 2005 book titled ''Eurabia: The Euro‐Arab Axis''.  Benjamin Lee of the  Centre for Research and Evidence on Security Threats at the [[University of Lancaster]] describes her work as arguing that Europe  "has surrendered to Islam and is in a state of submission (described as dhimmitude) in which Europe is forced to deny its own culture, stand silently by in the face of Muslim atrocities, accept Muslim immigration, and pay tribute through various types of economic assistance." According to the theory, the blame rests with a range of groups including communists, fascists, the media, universities, mosques and Islamic cultural centres, European bureaucrats, and the [[Euro-Arab Dialogue]].&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Lee|first1=Benjamin|title=Why we fight: Understanding the counter-jihad movement|journal=Religion Compass|date=October 2016|volume=10|issue=10|pages=257–265|doi=10.1111/rec3.12208}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The term has gained some public interest and has been used and discussed across a wide range of the political spectrum, including right-wing activists,&lt;ref name="Zuquete"/&gt; [[counter-jihad]]is and different sorts of anti-Islamic, and conservative activists. Bat Ye'or's “Mother conspiracy theory” has been used for further subtheories.&lt;ref name="MorgEur"/&gt; The narrative grew important in expressing [[Criticism of Islam|anti-Islamic sentiments]] and was used by movements like [[Stop Islamisation of Europe]]. It gained renewed interest after the 9/11 events and the use of the term by [[2011 Norway attacks|2011 Norway attacker]], [[Anders Behring Breivik]]. Ye'or's thesis has come under criticism by scholars, which intensified post Breivik.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; The conspiracy has been described as having resemblance to the anti-Semitic ''[[Protocols of the Elders of Zion]]''.&lt;ref name="Kuper2" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Schwartz|first1=Adi|title='The Protocols of the Elders of Brussels'|url=https://www.haaretz.com/print-edition/features/the-protocols-of-the-elders-of-brussels-1.190865|accessdate=8 December 2017|work=Haaretz|date=20 June 2006|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Hari|first1=Johann|title=Johann Hari: Amid all this panic, we must remember one simple fact -|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/voices/commentators/johann-hari/johann-hari-amid-all-this-panic-we-must-remember-one-simple-fact-muslims-are-not-all-the-same-5330241.html|website=The Independent|accessdate=8 December 2017|date=21 August 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Meer|first1=Nasar|title=Racialization and religion: race, culture and difference in the study of antisemitism and Islamophobia|journal=Ethnic and Racial Studies|date=March 2013|volume=36|issue=3|pages=385–398|doi=10.1080/01419870.2013.734392|quote=The protocols of Eurabia}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Eurabia is also discussed in classical [[anti-Europeanism]], a strong influence in the [[culture of the United States]] and in the notion of [[American exceptionalism]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://cadmus.eui.eu/bitstream/handle/1814/2767/04_25.pdf?sequence=1&amp;isAllowed=y Anti-Europeanism and Euroscepticism in the United States], Patrick Chamorel  No 25, EUI-RSCAS Working Papers from European University Institute (EUI), Robert Schuman Centre of Advanced Studies (RSCAS) 2004&lt;/ref&gt; which sometimes sees Europe on the decline or as a rising rival power, or, as is the case here, both.

== Basic narrative ==
In ''Eurabia: The Euro-Arab Axis'', Bat Ye'or says that Eurabia is the result of the [[Euro-Arab Dialogue]], based on an allegedly French-led European policy intended to increase European power against the United States by aligning its interests with those of the Arab countries. During the [[1973 oil crisis]], the [[European Economic Community]] (predecessor of the [[European Union]]), had entered into the [[Euro-Arab Dialogue]] (EAD) with the [[Arab League]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author= |title=Euro-Arab dialogue |url=http://www.medea.be/?doc=55&amp;lang=en |publisher=[MEDEA] |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150709040540/http://www.medea.be/?doc=55&amp;lang=en |archivedate=July 9, 2015 }} [http://www.medea.be/en/themes/euro-mediterranean-cooperation/euro-arab-dialogue/]&lt;/ref&gt; Ye'or says it as a primary cause of alleged European hostility to Israel, referring to joint Euro-Arab foreign policies that she characterises as [[anti-Americanism|anti-American]] and [[anti-Zionism|anti-Zionist]].&lt;ref name="Yeor1" /&gt; Ye'or purported a close connection of a Eurabia conspiracy and used the term "[[dhimmitude]]", denoting alleged "western subjection to Islam".&lt;ref name="Fekete" /&gt; The term itself is based on a newsletter published in the 1970s by the ''Comité européen de coordination des associations d'amitié avec le monde Arabe'', a Euro-Arab friendship committee.&lt;ref name="Eurabianewsletter"&gt;{{cite web|title=Eurabia (item listing)|publisher=Worldcat|url=http://www.worldcat.org/title/eurabia/oclc/5966570 |accessdate=May 11, 2012}}, &lt;!--{{worldcat|name=Eurabia|oclc=5966570}} --&gt;{{OCLC|5966570}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Yeor1"&gt;{{cite web|author=[[Bat Ye'or]]|title=Le dialogue Euro-Arabe et la naissance d'Eurabia|work=|publisher=Observatoire du monde juif|url=http://obs.monde.juif.free.fr/pdf/omj04-05.pdf|format=PDF|language=French|trans-title=The Euro-Arab Dialogue and the Birth of Eurabia|date=December 2002|accessdate=May 11, 2012}} [http://www.dhimmitude.org/archive/by_eurabia_122002_eng.doc English translation] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081217055404/http://www.dhimmitude.org/archive/by_eurabia_122002_eng.doc |date=2008-12-17 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Bat Ye'or's ''Eurabia: The Euro-Arab Axis'' was the first print publication in the Eurabia genre,&lt;ref name="Fekete" /&gt; which has since grown to a number of titles,&lt;ref name=Vaisse2010 /&gt;&lt;ref name="Kuper2" /&gt; including [[Melanie Phillips]]' ''Londonistan'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Melanie Phillips|title=[[Londonistan (book)|Londonistan]]: How Britain is creating a terror state within|publisher=Encounter|location=London|year=2006|isbn=9781594031441}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Oriana Fallaci]]'s ''[[The Force of Reason]]'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=[[Oriana Fallaci]]|title=La forza della ragione|language=Italian|trans-title=[[The Force of Reason]]|publisher=Rizzoli|location=Milano|year=2004|isbn=9788817002967}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Bruce Bawer's ''While Europe Slept''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=[[Bruce Bawer]]|title=While Europe Slept|publisher=Anchor/[[Random House]]|location=New York|year=2007|isbn=978-0767920056}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The term is often used by the writers [[Oriana Fallaci]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=[[Tunku Varadarajan]]|title=Prophet of Decline|quote="Europe is no longer Europe, it is 'Eurabia,' a colony of Islam"|publisher=The Wall Street Journal|url=http://www.opinionjournal.com/forms/printThis.html?id=110006858|date=June 23, 2005|accessdate=none}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Dopo Londra|title=Il nemico che trattiamo da amico| quote=Fallaci says''  "Sono quattr' anni che parlo di nazismo islamico, di guerra all' Occidente, di culto della morte, di suicidio dell' Europa.

("Since four years I am talking about the Islamic Nazism, the war to the West, the cult of death, the suicide of Europe.

An important part of the narrative is the idea of a [[demographic threat]], the fear that, at some time in the future, Islam will take over Europe.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jpost.com/International/Muslims-about-to-take-over-Europe|title=Muslims 'about to take over Europe'|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; or as [[Bernard Lewis]] put it, "Europe will be Islamic by the end of the century."&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.welt.de/print-welt/article211310/Europa-wird-islamisch.html "Europa wird islamisch" (original interview with Bernhard Lewis in the german newspaper  ''"Die Welt"'')]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Walter Laqueur]]'s ''The Last Days of Europe'' &lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Walter Laqeur|title=The Last Days of Europe|publisher=Thomas Dunne Books|location=New York|year=2007|isbn=9780312368708}}&lt;/ref&gt; is quoted often among the Eurabia literature; however, he modified his statements later.

==Impact==
The slogan has become a basic theme in the European extremist and populist right and expresses as well a significant strategy change. This has led to the adoption of political positions that were previously considered fringe or [[third rail of politics|third rail]] on either side. The main anti-Islamic theme has also penetrated into mainstream European politics,&lt;ref name="Zuquete" /&gt; for instance in the case of Dutch populist [[Party for Freedom]] leader [[Geert Wilders]]:
&lt;blockquote&gt;This government is enthusiastically co-operating with the Islamisation of the [[Netherlands]]. In all of Europe the elite opens the floodgates wide.

The [[Pew Research Center]] said in 2011 that "the data that we have isn't pointing in the direction of 'Eurabia' at all",&lt;ref&gt;Brian Grim quoted in Richard Greene, [http://religion.blogs.cnn.com/2011/01/27/world-muslim-population-doubling-report-projects/ World Muslim population doubling, report projects], CNN, 2011-01-27&lt;/ref&gt; and predicts that the percentage of Muslims is estimated to rise to 8% in 2030.

It is completely reasonable to assume that the overall Muslim population in Europe will increase, and Muslim citizens have and will have a significant imprint on European life.&lt;ref&gt;Kaufmann, Eric (20 March 2010).

[[Justin Vaïsse]] seeks to discredit what he calls, "four myths of the alarmist school", using [[Islam in France|Muslims in France]] as an example.

''[[The Economist]]'' rejected the concept of Eurabia as "[[fear mongering|scaremongering]]".&lt;ref name="Economist"&gt;{{cite news|title=Tales from Eurabia|work=The Economist|url=http://www.economist.com/node/7086222|date=June 22, 2006|accessdate=December 19, 2008|quote=Integration will be hard work for all concerned. But for the moment at least, the prospect of Eurabia looks like scaremongering.}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Simon Kuper]] in ''[[Financial Times]]'' described Ye'or's book as "little-read but influential", and akin to "[[The Protocols of the Elders of Zion|Protocols of the Elders of Zion]] in reverse", adding that "though ludicrous, Eurabia became the spiritual mother of a genre".&lt;ref name="Kuper2"&gt;{{cite news|author=[[Simon Kuper]]|title=The Crescent and the Cross.|url=https://www.ft.com/content/4cf288ba-8c13-11dc-af4d-0000779fd2ac|publisher=[[Financial Times]]|date=October 11, 2007|accessdate=May 13, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[David Aaronovitch]] acknowledges that the threat of "jihadist terror" may be real, but that there is no threat of Eurabia. Aaronovitch concludes that those who study conspiracy theories will recognize Eurabia to be a theory that adds the "Sad Dupes thesis to the Enemy Within idea".&lt;ref name="DA"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/comment/columnists/david_aaronovitch/article590235.ece|title=It's the latest disease: sensible people saying ridiculous things about Islam|accessdate=2008-03-08|author=[[David Aaronovitch]]|date=2005-11-15|publisher=The Times|location=London|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080907211712/http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/comment/columnists/david_aaronovitch/article590235.ece|archivedate=7 September 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In his book ''Wars of Blood and Faith'', conservative US military analyst [[Ralph Peters]] states that far from being about to take over Europe through demographic change, "Europe's Muslims are living on borrowed time" and that in the event of a major terrorist attack in Europe, thanks to the "ineradicable viciousness" of Europeans and what he perceives as a historical tendency to over-react to real or perceived threats, European Muslims "will be lucky if they're only deported."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Wars of Blood and Faith: The Conflicts That Will Shape the Twenty-First Century|pages=333–334|first=Ralph|last=Peters|publisher=Stackpole Books|year=2007|isbn=978-0-8117-0274-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Marján and Sapir, the very idea of "Eurabia" is "based on an extremist conspiracy theory, according to which Europe and the Arab states would join forces to make life impossible for [[Israel]] and Islamize the old continent."&lt;ref name="MarjanSapir"&gt;{{cite book|title=Europe's Destiny|last=Marján|first=Attila|author2=André Sapir|year=2010|publisher=[[Johns Hopkins University Press]]|location=Baltimore, MD|isbn=0-8018-9547-2|page=161}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Writing in ''[[Race &amp; Class]]'' in 2006, author and freelance journalist [[Matt Carr]] argued that Eurabia had moved from "an outlandish conspiracy theory" to a "dangerous Islamophobic fantasy". Carr states, {{quote|"In order to accept Ye'or's ridiculous thesis, it is necessary to believe not only in the existence of a concerted Islamic plot to subjugate Europe, involving all Arab governments, whether 'Islamic' or not, but also to credit a secret and unelected parliamentary body with the astounding ability to transform all Europe's major political, economic and cultural institutions into subservient instruments of 'jihad' without any of the continent's press or elected institutions being aware of it. Nowhere in this ideologically driven interpretation of European-Arab relations does Ye'or come close to proving the 'secret history' that she professes to reveal."&lt;ref name=carr&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Carr | first1 = M. | doi = 10.1177/0306396806066636 | title = You are now entering Eurabia | journal = Race &amp; Class | volume = 48 | pages = 1–22| year = 2006 | pmid =  | pmc = }}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Arun Kundnani, writing for the International Centre for Counter-terrorism, notes that "Eurabia" fulfills the [[counter-jihad]] movement's "structural need" for a conspiracy theory, and compares "Eurabia" to ''[[The Protocols of the Elders of Zion]]'',&lt;ref name=kundnani&gt;{{cite web|author=Arun Kundnani|title=Blind Spot?

===2011 Norway attacks===
''2083: A European Declaration of Independence'', the manifesto of [[Anders Behring Breivik]], the perpetrator of the [[2011 Norway attacks]], includes a lengthy discussion of and support for the "Eurabia" theory. It also contains several articles on the Eurabia theme by Bat Ye'or and [[Fjordman]].

The court finds that very few people, however, share Breivik's idea that the alleged "Islamization" should be fought with terror."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nettavisen.no/nyheter/article3458481.ece Smilende Breivik fornøyd med dommen], nettavisen.no, 24.08.12&lt;/ref&gt;

Breivik has later identified himself as a [[Fascism|fascist]] and voiced support for [[Neo-Nazism|neo-Nazis]], stating that he previously had exploited "counterjihad" rhetoric in order to protect "[[Ethnic nationalism|ethno-nationalists]]", thereby instead launching a media drive against what he deemed "anti-nationalist counterjihad"-supporters.&lt;ref name="Expo14"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://expo.se/2014/breivik-vill-deportera-illojala-judar_6336.html|title=Breivik vill deportera "illojala judar" [Breivik wants to deport "disloyal Jews"]|work=[[Expo (magazine)|Expo]]|date=10 January 2014|language=Swedish|author=Daniel Vergara }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.reuters.com/article/2014/09/05/us-norway-breivik-idUSKBN0H01NG20140905 "Mass killer Breivik says wants to create fascist party"].

Eurabia theories have also been espoused by less typical conservatives, for example, [[Bruce Bawer]], an American expatriate who has lived in Europe since the 1990s, and supported Ye'or's allegations that there was a deliberate, coordinated effort to create Eurabia. He offered guarded approval of some of Ye'or's ideas, but also wrote: "I’d strongly question the implication that the entire European political establishment has been in on the effort to unite Europe and the Arab world, and to this end has labored to encourage immigration and discourage integration."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Bawer |first=Bruce |title=Crisis in Europe |work=[[The Hudson Review]] |volume=58 |issue=4 |date=Winter 2006 |url=http://www.hudsonreview.com/bawerWi06.html |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20130125163625/http%3A%2F%2Fwww.hudsonreview.com%2FbawerWi06.html |archivedate=2013-01-25 |df= }}, [http://archive.frontpagemag.com/readArticle.aspx?ARTID=4782] {{Webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20130705202128/http://archive.frontpagemag.com/readArticle.aspx?ARTID=4782 |date=2013-07-05 }} [https://archive.is/20130125163625/http://www.hudsonreview.com/bawerWi06.html]&lt;/ref&gt; Bawer argued that many European politicians and policy makers, in efforts to gain approval of Muslim voters or to appeal to [[multiculturalism]], were effectively allowing the creation of Muslim-only enclaves where basic human rights were ignored and events like [[honor killing]]s had become commonplace.&lt;ref&gt;Bruce Bawer, ''Surrender: Appeasing Islam, Sacrificing Freedom'', Doubleday, 2009-05-19, {{ISBN|978-0-385-52398-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Bruce Bawer, ''The New Quislings: How the International Left Used the Oslo Massacre to Silence Debate About Islam'', Broadside Books, 2012-01-31, {{ISBN|9780062188694}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A 2007 film outline by [[Steve Bannon]], who would later become the chief strategist for President [[Donald Trump]] and a member of the [[U.S. National Security Council]], proposed that Muslims were trying to turn the United States into the "Islamic States of America".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite newspaper|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/bannon-film-outline-warned-us-could-turn-into-islamic-states-of-america/2017/02/03/f73832f4-e8be-11e6-b82f-687d6e6a3e7c_story.html|title=Bannon film outline warned U.S. could turn into ‘Islamic States of America’|work=Washington Post|date=February 2, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Forum 18''' is a Norwegian human rights organization that promotes [[Freedom of religion|religious freedom]]. The organization's name is based on Article 18 of the [[Universal Declaration of Human Rights]]. Forum 18 summarizes the article as:

*The right to believe, to worship and witness
*The right to change one's belief or religion
*The right to join together and express one's belief&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.forum18.org/Forum18.php |title=About Forum 18 |publisher=Forum 18 |accessdate=14 December 2012 |archivedate=December 14, 2012 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6CtYeWQwb?url=http://www.forum18.org/Forum18.php |deadurl=no |df=mdy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''Forum 18 News Service'', established by Forum 18 in 2003, is a Christian web and e-mail initiative to report on threats and actions against the religious freedom of all people, whatever their religious affiliation, in an objective, truthful and timely manner. The news service mainly concentrates on the states of the former [[Soviet Union]], including Belarus and Central Asia, and Eastern Europe, but has also published reports on Kosovo, [[Republic of Macedonia|Macedonia]], Serbia, Turkey, Burma, China (including [[Xinjiang]]), Laos, Mongolia, North Korea, and Vietnam.

The news service is published in two editions: a weekly news summary each Friday; and an almost daily edition published on weekdays. There is a searchable archive of reports, including religious freedom surveys of countries and regions, and personal commentaries on religious freedom issues.

In August 2005 one of the organisation's [[reporter]]s was detained and deported by the authorities at [[Tashkent]] airport in Uzbekistan,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.eurasianet.org/departments/civilsociety/articles/eav081605.shtml|title=Uzbekistan Draws Curtain of Secrecy Tighter|accessdate=October 24, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; but it carries on covering that country.

The reports on religious freedom from Forum 18 News Service are widely used by international organizations like [[Amnesty International]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.amnesty.org/en/ai_search?keywords=%22Forum+18%22&amp;op=Search&amp;form_id=search_theme_form&amp;form_token=bf71dde59bdf0c7e059316410e97136b|title=Search for 'Forum 18' on www.amnesty.org|accessdate=October 24, 2010|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110611184223/http://www.amnesty.org/en/ai_search?keywords=%22Forum+18%22&amp;op=Search&amp;form_id=search_theme_form&amp;form_token=bf71dde59bdf0c7e059316410e97136b|archive-date=June 11, 2011|dead-url=yes|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Human Rights Watch]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.hrw.org/en/search/apachesolr_search/%22Forum+18%22|title=Search for 'Forum 18' on www.hrw.org|accessdate=October 24, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe]] (OSCE),&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.osce.org/search/?displayMode=3&amp;lsi=true&amp;q=Forum+18+news+service&amp;GO=GO|title=Search for 'Forum 18' on www.osce.org|accessdate=October 24, 2010}}{{dead link|date=December 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as numerous news sites with different religious affiliation (i.e. Muslim,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.muslimnews.co.uk/news/news.php?article=14722|title=The Muslim News website|accessdate=October 24, 2010|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110802160859/http://www.muslimnews.co.uk/news/news.php?article=14722|archivedate=August 2, 2011|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Christian,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://baptist.org.ru/news/english/1840/|title=The Union of Evangelical Christian-Baptists of Russia website|accessdate=October 24, 2010|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110726060034/http://baptist.org.ru/news/english/1840/|archivedate=July 26, 2011|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bahá'í,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.bahaindex.com/en/news/human-rights/3069-central-asia-interview-with-felix-corley-religious-rights-activis|title=The Bahá'í Faith Index website|accessdate=October 24, 2010|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110707232029/http://www.bahaindex.com/en/news/human-rights/3069-central-asia-interview-with-felix-corley-religious-rights-activis|archivedate=July 7, 2011|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Buddhist,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.buddhistchannel.tv/index.php?id=3,1527,0,0,1,0|title=The Buddhist Channel website|accessdate=October 24, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;).

==Federal level==
The federal government is bound by several laws intended to promote  openness in government. However, these normally apply only to federal  bodies, leaving many institutions exempt compared to their counterparts in other countries.

===U.S. Attorney General Memorandums===

====History====

The Holder Memo is part of series of policy memos on how federal agencies should apply FOIA exemptions. Beginning in 1977 with Attorney General [[Griffin Bell]], and continued by Attorney General [[William French Smith]] in 1981 and Attorney General [[Janet Reno]] in 1993, U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) has announced how the executive branch should approach FOIA, its application, and DOJ's defense of agency's actions. In other words, DOJ's position on when they would defend in a FOIA suit has seesawed for about the last three decades.

=====Reno Memo=====

The Reno Memo&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.usdoj.gov/oip/foia_updates/Vol_XIV_3/page3.htm|title=FOIA Update: Attorney General Reno's FOIA Memorandum|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; established a "presumption" in favor of disclosure by providing that "it shall be the policy of the Department of Justice to defend the assertion of a FOIA exemption only in those cases where the agency reasonably foresees that disclosure would be harmful to an interest protected by that exemption". It encouraged all government agencies to review FOIA requests in a manner most favorable to openness and to release information, even though it might fall within one of the nine exemption categories, if no "foreseeable harm" would result from the disclosure. The goal was to achieve the "maximum responsible disclosure".

=====Ashcroft Memo=====

On October 12, 2001, Attorney General [[John Ashcroft]] issued a policy memorandum on FOIA to all federal executive agencies. The AG declared the Department of Justice (DOJ) would defend agencies' decisions to withhold documents from a FOIA requester under one of the statute's exemptions "unless they lack a sound legal basis or present an unwarranted risk of adverse impact on the ability of other agencies to protect other important records".

The Ashcroft Memorandum reversed the Reno standard. Agencies were told that in making discretionary FOIA decisions they should carefully consider the fundamental values behind the exemptions—national security, privacy, government's interests, etc.—and to lean in their favor whenever possible. The Ashcroft Memo&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://fas.org/sgp/foia/ashcroft.html|title=New Attorney General FOIA Memorandum Issued|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; with its "sound legal basis" standard encouraged (or at least seemed to support) greater use of FOIA exemptions by federal agency personnel.

=====AG Holder Memo=====
{{Update|inaccurate=yes|date=February 2018}}
The Ashcroft Memo was rescinded by Attorney General [[Eric Holder]] on March 14, 2009. The AG Holder Memo&lt;ref&gt;http://www.usdoj.gov/ag/foia-memo-march2009.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; appears to have reinstated the Reno Memo standard and extends the policy. The policy of the executive branch is to be open, responsive, transparent, and accountable. The current memo encourages the maximum disclosure possible in discretionary exemptions and to, whenever possible, reasonably segregate exempt information and release the rest.

==State legislation==
{{expand section|date=November 2013}}
All fifty [[U.S. states]] also have freedom of information laws that govern documents at state and local levels.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.foiadvocates.com/records.html|title=State Public Record Laws|publisher=FOIAdvocates}}&lt;/ref&gt;

States have various laws requiring that meetings convened by government agencies be open to the public and sufficiently advertised; these are known as '''open meeting laws'''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=State open meetings laws |url=https://ballotpedia.org/State_open_meetings_laws |publisher=Ballotpedia |accessdate=13 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The provisions of these laws vary considerably by state.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=National Freedom of Information Coalition|title=State Freedom of Information Laws|url=http://www.nfoic.org/state-freedom-of-information-laws|website=nfoic.org|publisher=National Freedom of Information Coalition|accessdate=23 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Florida, Ohio, and Vermont are known for having pro-access freedom of information laws. Florida was one of the first states to enact an open government sunshine law. Other jurisdictions, such as Pennsylvania and the District of Columbia, were until recently known for being relatively non-transparent but have since made significant changes to their open government laws to foster greater public access to information.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rcfp.org/browse-media-law-resources/guides/open-government-guide/introduction|title=Open Government Guide|edition=Sixth|date=2011|publisher=[[Reporters Committee for Freedom of the Press]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On April 29, 2013, in the case of &lt;u&gt;[[McBurney v. Young]]&lt;/u&gt;, the [[Supreme Court of the United States|United States Supreme Court]] found that Virginia's Freedom of Information Act, which grants only Virginia citizens access to public records and does not grant any such right to non-Virginians, does not violate the [[Privileges and Immunities Clause]] (which only protects those privileges and immunities that are "fundamental"&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.scotusblog.com/case-files/cases/mcburney-v-young/|title=McBurney v. Young - SCOTUSblog|work=SCOTUSblog|access-date=2017-06-22|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;) or the [[Commerce Clause]] (specifically, the [[Dormant Commerce Clause]] doctrine) of the [[United States Constitution]].&lt;ref&gt;{{ussc|name=McBurney v. Young|link=https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/12pdf/12-17_d1o2.pdf|volume=569|year=2013|docket=12-017|slip=1-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1841">The '''Global Pound Conference series''' (GPC) was a series of conferences about [[alternative dispute resolution]] (ADR) held in many cities in several countries in 2016/2017. The title of the conference series was "Shaping the Future of Dispute Resolution &amp; Improving Access to Justice".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Shaping the Future of Dispute Resolution and Improving Access to Justice|url=http://globalpoundconference.org/|website=Global Pound Conference Series 2016-17|accessdate=9 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;. It was organised as an initiative of the [[International Mediation Institute]] (IMI). 

The series was inspired by Harvard law professor [[Roscoe Pound]] and a 1976 conference&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Levin|first1=Diane|title=30 years after the historic Pound Conference, a reflection on ADR and justice in the 21st century|url=http://mediationblog.blogspot.de/2006/04/30-years-after-historic-pound.html|website=Online Guide to Mediation|accessdate=9 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; named for him, which was an impetus for the growth in the popularity of [[mediation]] in the USA.

The GPC series brought Global Pound Conferences to multiple locations around the world in 2016 and 2017, with the aim of raising awareness about the various dispute resolution methods available. It brought together users, providers and advisors to discuss the future direction of ADR.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The 2016 Global Pound Conference Series|url=https://imimediation.org/be-part-of-the-gpc-series|website=International Mediation Institute|accessdate=9 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;. After ending, the GPC platform changed to become the '''Global Pound Conversation''', a blog and research series covering changes and developments in mediation and alternative dispute resolution around the world.

The '''House of European History''' ('''HEH''') ({{lang-fr|Maison de l'Histoire européenne}}, {{lang-nl|Huis van de Europese geschiedenis}}) is a [[museum]] in [[Brussels]], [[Belgium]] that focuses on the [[history of Europe]] since 1789. It is an initiative by the [[European Parliament]] and opened on 6 May 2017.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.europarl.europa.eu/news/en/news-room/20170504IPR73468/european-parliament-opens-the-house-of-european-history-on-6-may-2017&lt;/ref&gt; As a cultural institution and exhibition centre, the House of European History intends to promote the understanding of European history and [[European integration]], through a permanent exhibition and temporary and travelling exhibitions.

It houses a collection of objects and documents representative of European history, [[educational programs]], cultural events and [[publications]], as well as a wide range of online content. It is located in the Eastman Building near the [[Leopold Park]] in Brussels, close to the [[Brussels and the European Union#Quarter|European institutions]].

==Origins==

The idea of creating a museum dedicated to European history was launched on 13 February 2007 by President [[Hans-Gert Pöttering]] in his inaugural speech as [[president of the European Parliament]]. One of the key objectives of the project was "to enable Europeans of all generations to learn more about their own history and, by so doing, to contribute to a better understanding of the development of Europe, now and in the future."&lt;ref name="europarl.europa.eu"&gt;http://www.europarl.europa.eu/meetdocs/2004_2009/documents/dv/745/745721/745721_en.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; 

In October 2008, a committee of experts led by Professor {{ill|Hans Walter Hütter|de}}, the Head of the House of the History of the Federal Republic of Germany,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.europarl.europa.eu/meetdocs/2004_2009/documents/dv/745/745721/745721_en.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; submitted a report entitled "Conceptual Basis for a House of European History" which established the general concept and content of the project and outlined its institutional structure. 

In June 2009, the [[Bureau of the European Parliament]] decided to assign the former Eastman Dental Hospital to the future museum and, in July, launched an international [[architectural competition]]. On 31 March 2011, the winning practice Atelier d'architecture Chaix &amp; Morel et associés (FR)&lt;ref&gt;http://www.chaixetmorel.com/&lt;/ref&gt;, [[:de:JSWD Architekten|JSWD Architects (DE)]]&lt;ref&gt;http://www.jswd-architekten.de/&lt;/ref&gt; and TPF (BE)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.tpf.eu/red4net/pub_content.asp?content=1&amp;id=444&amp;pmi=22 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-02-28 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110228184013/http://www.tpf.eu/red4net/pub_content.asp?content=1&amp;id=444&amp;pmi=22 |archivedate=28 February 2011 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; was appointed to carry out the renovation and extension of the building. With the backing of an expert board which brings together internationally renowned specialists chaired by Professor [[Włodzimierz Borodziej]], a multi-disciplinary team of professionals led by historian and curator Taja Vovk van Gaal was set up within the European Parliament's Directorate-General for Communication&lt;ref&gt;http://www.europarl.europa.eu/aboutparliament/en/00d7a6c2b2/Secretariat.html?tab=eParliament_secretariat_dgcomm&lt;/ref&gt; to prepare the exhibitions and the structure of the future establishment.

==Collection and scope==

The House of European History gives visitors the opportunity to learn about European historical processes and events, and engage in critical reflection about the implication of the processes on the present day. It is a centre for exhibitions, documentation and information which places processes and events within a wider historical and critical context, bringing together and juxtaposing the contrasting historical experiences of European people. 

[[File:Leopold.Park.jpg|thumb|left|View of the [[Leopold Park]] by the museum]]
It is planned that the main focus of the permanent exhibition will be on [[European history]] of the 20th century and the history of [[European integration]],&lt;ref name="europarl.europa.eu"/&gt; with additional perspectives on the main historical processes of previous centuries. The aim is not simply to present summaries of national histories, but to look at important historical phenomena from a [[transnational history|transnational]] and European perspective.

The originality of the project lies, therefore, in the endeavour to convey a transnational overview of European history, while taking into account the diversity of European history and its many interpretations and perceptions. It aims to enable a wide public to understand recent history in the context of previous centuries that have marked and shaped ideas and values. In this way the House aims to facilitate discussion and debate about Europe and the [[European Union]]. 

With a surface area of approximately {{convert|4,000|m2}} at its disposal, the permanent exhibition is the centrepiece of the House of European History. Using objects and documents and an extensive range of media, it provides a journey through the [[history of Europe]], principally that of the 20th century, with retrospectives on developments and events in earlier periods which were of particular significance for the whole continent. In this context, the history of [[European integration]] is exhibited in all its uniqueness and with all its complexity.

The House is visitor-centred, wheelchair- and pushchair-friendly and open to all, in compliance with the European Parliament's policies relating to accessibility. To that end its main offers are presented in at least 24 languages, corresponding to the [[official languages of the European Union]] at the time of opening. Given that [[multilingualism]] is an expression of the cultural diversity of Europe, the House of European History wants its visitors to experience its multilingual exhibits and services as one of the institution's main assets.

In December 2012, in the context of the [[Nobel Peace Prize]] awarded to the European Union,&lt;ref&gt;https://www.nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/peace/laureates/2012/&lt;/ref&gt; it was decided that the Nobel medal and diploma will form part of the permanent exhibition of the House of European History, as the first objects in its collection.&lt;ref&gt;http://europa.eu/newsroom/highlights/eunobel/pdf/12_en.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.express.co.uk/posts/view/363773/EU-leaders-collect-Nobel-Peace-Prize-to-put-in-82m-Museum-of-European-History&lt;/ref&gt; 

==Location==
[[File:Eastmanbuilding.jpg|thumb|The Eastman building, pictured in 2012 before its refurbishment|alt=]]

The Eastman building,&lt;ref&gt;http://wikimapia.org/9859513/Eastman-Building-European-Parliament-formerly-the-George-Eastman-Dental-Institute&lt;/ref&gt; originally designed to house a dental clinic, was named after [[George Eastman]], the American philanthropist and inventor of the [[Kodak]] camera. His generous donations allowed the creation of dental centres in New York, London, Rome, Paris, [[Brussels]] and [[Stockholm]], dedicated to providing free dental care for disadvantaged children. 

In 1933, the Eastman Foundation approached the Swiss architect Michel Polak, known for his [[Art Deco]] style and particularly the famous [[Résidence Palace]] in Brussels, to design the new building. Inaugurated in 1935&lt;ref&gt;http://www.europarl.europa.eu/thinktank/en/document.html?reference=EPRS_BRI(2016)577957&lt;/ref&gt;, the building is interesting both in terms of its engineering and its [[Art Deco]] elements. In the former children's waiting room there is a series of murals by the painter Camille Barthélémy illustrating [[La Fontaine]]’s fables. 

The [[Leopold Park]], containing a number of historic buildings such as the Pasteur Institute and the Solvay Library, was listed in 1976. The Eastman Building itself is not listed. The dental clinic closed its doors before the building was converted into offices for the [[European institutions]] in the 1980s.

==Management and direction==
The House of European History was created at the initiative of the [[European Parliament]] but is run independently.

The museum is directed by a Board of Trustees, chaired by the former president of the European Parliament [[Hans-Gert Pöttering]]. Its members include [[Étienne Davignon]], [[Włodzimierz Borodziej]], [[Miguel Angel Martinez Martinez|Miguel Angel Martinez]], [[Gérard Onesta]], [[Doris Pack]], [[Chrysoula Paliadeli]], {{ill|Hans Walter Hütter|de}}, [[Charles Picqué]], [[Alain Lamassoure]], [[Peter Sutherland]], [[Androulla Vassiliou]], [[Diana Wallis]], and [[Francis Wurtz]].

The Academic Committee, chaired by Włodzimierz Borodziej, comprises historians and museum curators. Its members are [[Norman Davies]], Hans-Walter Hütter, [[Matti Klinge]], [[Miguel Angel Martínez Martínez]], Anita Meinarte, Hélène Miard-Delacroix, Mary Michailidou, Hans-Gert Pöttering, Antonio Reis, Maria Schmidt, Jean-Pierre Verdier, [[Henk Wesseling]] and [[Oliver Rathkolb]].&lt;ref&gt;http://thedanubememorial.org/wp-content/uploads/2011/10/Oliver-Rathkolb.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; The academic team which is responsible for curating exhibitions is led by Taja Vovk van Gaal.

==Estimated costs and funding==
Development phase 2011–2015: €31 million&lt;ref&gt;http://www.faz.net/aktuell/politik/europaeische-union/eu-museum-stolz-und-scham-11623924.html&lt;/ref&gt; for the renovation and extension of the building, €21.4 million for the permanent and the first temporary exhibitions (€15.4 million for fitting-out exhibition and other spaces, €6 million for [[multilingualism]]) and €3.75 million to build up the collection. The museum is funded by the [[European Parliament]].

==Controversies==

Since its initial conception, the House of European History project has been controversial, especially in the UK. The alleged "attempt to find a single unifying narrative of the histories of 27 disparate member states" has been criticised by the British [[think tank]] [[Civitas (think tank)|Civitas]], saying "the House of European History can achieve nothing but a disingenuous paradox, aiming to tell the history of all the 27 states, but in fact relating no history at all."&lt;ref&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

More than the museum's contents, the museum's costs have come under fire. The costs were accused of having "more than doubled",&lt;ref&gt;

The museum's permanent exhibition was criticised by [[Platform of European Memory and Conscience]] which accused the museum of favourable bias in relation to the portrayal of [[communism]] in the [[Eastern Block]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.memoryandconscience.eu/2017/10/23/platform-prepares-critical-report-on-the-house-of-european-history-in-brussels/ Platform prepares critical report on the House of European History in Brussels] and [https://www.memoryandconscience.eu/2017/11/20/platform-calls-for-a-broad-debate-and-a-change-of-the-permanent-exhibition-of-the-house-of-european-history/ Platform calls for a broad debate and a change of the permanent exhibition of the House of European History], [[Platform of European Memory and Conscience]]&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Acton Institute]] criticised the permanent exhibition for "erasing religion" as a factor in European history.&lt;ref&gt;[https://acton.org/publications/transatlantic/2017/06/14/house-european-history-erases-religion The House of European History erases religion], [[Acton Institute]]&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="11507">{{Politics of Fiji}}
[[Fiji]] is an island nation in Melanesia in the South Pacific Ocean with a population of approximately 849,000.&lt;ref name=unpop&gt;{{cite journal | url=https://www.un.org/esa/population/publications/wpp2008/wpp2008_text_tables.pdf | title=World Population Prospects, Table A.1| version=2008 revision  | format=PDF | publisher=United Nations | author=Department of Economic and Social Affairs Population Division | year=2009 | accessdate= 2009-03-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is made up of Fijians (57 per cent), Indo-Fijians (37 per cent), Europeans, Chinese, other Pacific islanders, and people of mixed racial descent (6 per cent). Fiji has been in a state of political unrest since their independence from Britain in 1970. 

Normally the Fijian political system is one of a parliamentary representative democratic republic. There have been four military coups since Fiji's independence from Britain in 1970. Since 1987 the military has either had a significant influence in the politics of Fiji, or have been directly ruling. Fiji was governed by military-backed régime from December 2006 to September 2014, at which point [[Fijian general election, 2014|a general election restored a parliamentary civilian government]].

==International Treaties==
Fiji became a member of the [[United Nations]] 13 October 1970.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.un.org/en/members/ Member States of the United Nations]&lt;/ref&gt; Fiji has acceded to some, but not the majority, of the key human rights treaties. It is a party to the conventions against racism ([[Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination]]) and discrimination against women ([[Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination Against Women|Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women]]), and on the rights of the child ([[Convention on the Rights of the Child|Convention on the rights of the Child]]). 

In March 2016, Fiji ratified the ([[Convention Against Torture]]). Fiji has not acceded to the covenants on civil and political rights ([[International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights]]), or on economic, social and cultural rights ([[International Covenant on Economic, Social, and Cultural Rights|International Covenant on Economic Social and Cultural rights]]). Fiji is also not a party to the convention on persons with disabilities ([[Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities]]).

==Protection of human rights in the Constitution and domestic legislation==
The most current constitution of Fiji [[2013 Constitution of Fiji|was introduced in 2013]], laying the groundwork for the restoration of democracy.

The fourth chapter of the 1997 [[1997 Constitution of Fiji|Constitution of Fiji]], titled the Bill of Rights, comprised a total of twenty three sections and contained provisions for human rights protections. The 1997 constitution was the supreme law of Fiji from the creation of it in 1997 until April 2009. However, it  was suspended by President Josefa Iloilo in April 2009 after the [[Court of Appeal (Fiji)|Fijian Court of Appeal]] ruled that the military government that was in power, who took over as a result of a coup d’etat in 2006, illegal.

Even though the Constitution of Fiji was abrogated in 2009, the President on 10 April 2009, issued the “Existing Law Decree 2009” stipulating that all “Existing Laws in force immediately before the 10th day of April 2009 shall continue in force....” “Existing Laws” meant all written laws other than the Constitution Amendment Act 1997. This decree guaranteed the continued existence of all human rights related local laws existing in Fiji during and including the time of the abrogation of the Constitution.

The new Constitution introduced in 2013 includes a Bill of Rights (chapter 2, articles 6 to 45). It protects, among others, the right of [[habeas corpus]], the right to [[due process]], freedom of expression, freedom of movement and association, [[freedom of conscience]], the right to privacy, the right to participate through elections in the political process, protection from discrimination (on any grounds including ethnicity, gender, social origin, sexual orientation, age, "economic or social or health status", disability or religion), property rights, the right to education, "the right of every person to work and to a just minimum wage", the right to adequate housing, access to food and water, and the right to health and to [[social security]] schemes. It also guarantees (article 40) "the right to a clean and healthy environment, which includes the right to have the natural world protected for the benefit of present and future generations".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fiji.gov.fj/getattachment/8e981ca2-1757-4e27-88e0-f87e3b3b844e/Click-here-to-download-the-Fiji-Constitution.aspx Constitution of Fiji, 2013]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Fiji Human Rights Commission==
{{See|Fiji Human Rights Commission}}
[Information here removed as copyright violation. The information may be found at its original source [http://www.fhrc.org.fj/ here].]

The Human Rights Commission Decree 2009 was passed by the military regime to establish the Commission and lays the groundwork in its work in and out of the country. Since then, the Commission have played a vital role in promoting human rights in Fiji and advocating it abroad. During the [[2009 Fijian constitutional crisis]], the Fiji Human Rights Commission showed support for the then President, Ratu Josefa Iloilo, stating that "the President had no choice but to abrogate the 1997 Constitution after the Fiji Court of Appeal ruled that the interim government was illegal." However, the Head of the Fijian Human Rights Commission, [[Shaista Shameem]], also stated that the Commission would act as if the Bill of Rights part of the Constitution was still legally in effect.

==Human Rights Violations==
The [[Universal Periodic Review]], which is a progress which involves a review of the human rights records of the Member States of the UN, by the [[Human Rights Council]], every four years, reviewed the human rights situation in Fiji in August 2009.

“Fiji remains a military dictatorship that denies its citizens the right to take part in self-government through free and fair elections, as well as the freedoms of speech, press, assembly, and religion. Since the December 5, 2006 coup d'état, the military and police have arbitrarily arrested and detained human rights defenders, journalists and others perceived as critical of the administration. Four people have died in military or police custody and dozens of people have been intimidated, beaten, sexually assaulted, or subjected to degrading treatment. Fiji's interim administration continues to fail to uphold the rule of law and has seriously compromised the independence of the judiciary. No UN special procedures have visited since the 2006 coup. A visit by the UN Special Rapporteur on the independence of judges and lawyers is pending, though the Fiji government has failed to advise a suitable time for this visit. The government has not responded to the request to visit of the Special Rapporteur on torture and other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment.”&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.hrw.org/news/2010/02/09/universal-periodic-review-fiji] Summary of main issues of concern in the Submission by the Human Rights Watch to the Universal Periodic Review on Fiji&lt;/ref&gt;

==Proposed Reforms==
In July 2009, the interim Prime Minister Voreqe Bainimarama announced that Fiji would have a new constitution by 2013.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/asia-pacific/8128211.stm "Fiji constitution plan unveiled"] BBC News, July 1, 2009&lt;/ref&gt; This new constitution would derive from the [[People's Charter for Change, Peace and Progress]] and well as from “extensive consultations with political parties, non-governmental organizations and ordinary citizens.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fijitimes.com/story.aspx?id=124623 "Work on Fiji's Constitution to start in 3 years"], ''Fiji Times'', July 1, 2009&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fiji.gov.fj/publish/page_15376.shtml "PM Bainimarama - A Strategic Framework for Change"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090721052532/http://www.fiji.gov.fj/publish/page_15376.shtml |date=2009-07-21 }}, Fiji government website, July 1, 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[United Nations special rapporteur]] has urged the government of Fiji to strengthen its Human Rights Commission by ratifying several key international agreements including the [[International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights]] and the ILO agreement on [[Indigenous and Tribal Peoples Convention, 1989]]. He urged the strengthening of the '''Fiji's Human Rights and Anti-Discrimination Commission''' and the peaceful dealing with hate speech on social media without infringing on people's [[freedom of expression]]. These he said, are the key issues holding the nation back on taking a step forward in its dealings with human rights.&lt;ref name="RNZI0315"&gt;{{cite web| last = | first = | work= Radio New Zealand International|title= UN urges Fiji to strengthen its Human Rights Commission|date =22 June 2017|url= http://www.radionz.co.nz/international/pacific-news/333535/un-urges-fiji-to-strengthen-its-human-rights-commission}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3501">[[File:Emblem of the Hungarian National Defence Association (MOVE).svg|thumb|250px|Emblem of MOVE, ca. 1920]]
The '''Hungarian National Defence Association''' ({{lang-hu|'''Magyar Országos Véderő Egylet'''}} or {{lang|hu|'''MOVE'''}}) was an early [[far right]] movement active in [[Hungary]]. The structure of the group was largely [[paramilitary]] and as such separate from its leader's later political initiatives.&lt;ref&gt;Tibor Iván Berend, ''Decades of Crisis: Central and Eastern Europe Before World War II'', University of California Press, 1998, p. 109&lt;/ref&gt;

MOVE grew out of the 'right radicals' phenomenon i.e. those who strongly opposed the [[Hungarian Soviet Republic]] but who felt that the mainstream [[conservatism|conservatives]] were not strong enough to cope with the shift to communism.&lt;ref name="Payne"&gt;[[Stanley G.

When [[Miklós Horthy]] ousted the communists MOVE was largely turned over to him, although it continued to develop along fascist lines, offering support for [[Benito Mussolini]] and establishing contacts with [[Adolf Hitler]] and [[Erich Ludendorff]] in [[Germany]].&lt;ref name="Payne"/&gt; Under Horthy MOVE enjoyed a final period of influence as all existing Nazi and rightist paramilitary groups were merged into it.&lt;ref&gt;C.P. Blamires, ''World Fascism - A Historical Encyclopedia'', ABC-CLIO, 2006, p. 326&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1945, MOVE was banned under decree 529/1945, ME regulation, §3.

{{NPOV|date=December 2015}}

'''Institutionalized discrimination''' refers to the unjust and discriminatory mistreatment of an individual or group of individuals by society and its institutions as a whole, through unequal selection or bias, intentional or unintentional; as opposed to individuals making a conscious choice to discriminate. It stems from systemic stereotypical beliefs (such as sexist or racist beliefs) that are held by the vast majority living in a society where stereotypes and discrimination are the norm (see [[institutionalized racism]]).&lt;ref&gt;Aronson, E., Wilson, T. D., &amp; Akert, R. M. (2010). Social Psychology (7th edition). New York: Pearson.&lt;/ref&gt;
Such discrimination is typically codified into the operating procedures, policies, laws, or objectives of such institutions.  Members of minority groups such as populations of African descent in the [[Racism_and_ethnic_discrimination_in_the_United_States#Racism_against_African_Americans|U.S.]] are at a much higher risk of encountering these types of sociostructural disadvantage. Among the severe and long-lasting detrimental effects of institutionalized discrimination on affected populations are [[Suicide_among_LGBT_youth|increased suicide rates]], [http://iasp.brandeis.edu/pdfs/Author/shapiro-thomas-m/racialwealthgapbrief.pdf suppressed attainment of wealth] and [http://usatoday30.usatoday.com/news/health/2008-03-10-health-disparities_N.htm?csp=34 decreased access to health care].

==Examples==
Examples of institutionalized discrimination include laws and decisions that reflect racism, such as the ''[[Plessy vs. Ferguson]]'' U.S. Supreme Court case.  The verdict of this case ruled in favor of separate but equal public facilities between African Americans and non-African Americans. This ruling was struck down by the ''[[Brown vs. Board of Education]]'' [[Supreme Court of the United States|Supreme Court]] decision. Institutionalized discrimination often exists within the government, though it can also occur in any other type of social institution including religion, education and marriage. [[Achievement gap]]s in education ''per se'' are an example of institutionalized discrimination. Two recent studies aimed to explain the complications of assessing educational progress within the United States. One study focused on high school graduation rates, whereas the other study compared dropout rates in [[suburban]] and [[Urban area|urban]] schools. By taking a closer look at statistics of test scores and academic achievement, researchers noticed that wealthy whites do better than blacks, poor whites, and Latinos. According to Star Parker, reporter of the ''Durham Herald Sun'', graduation rates among whites and Asians are about 25 percent higher than those of minority groups (blacks, Hispanics, American Indians). This signifies that academic achievement is linked to socioeconomic status.&lt;ref name="Star Parker"&gt;{{citation|author=Parker, Star|title=Profiles in Education|publisher=Durham Herald|date=2008-04-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Spillover effects==
Institutionalized discrimination also exists in institutions aside from the [[government]] such as [[religion]], [[education]], and [[marriage]] among many other. Routines that encourage the selection of one individual over another, for instance in an employment situation, is a form of institutionalized discrimination. The phenomenon occurs unintentionally at times.

[[Thomas Shapiro]]’s ''The Hidden Cost of Being [[African American]]'' addresses many of the problems faced by African Americans in the United States and how their current social and economic situations compare to one another. These issues include the [[Racial wealth gap in the United States|racial wealth gap]] between blacks and whites, [[assets]], and [[education]]. Housing in the United States is valued differently based on the racial makeup of the neighborhood. There can be two identical houses in terms of amenities and size but the value of each house depends on the racial makeup of the people within the [[community]]. Tactics like [[blockbusting]], a method where [[real estate]] agents survey white homeowners in an area can cause a shift in the composition of a neighborhood. Although the concept of blockbusting has been illegal since [https://www.citylab.com/equity/2015/03/how-real-estate-brokers-can-profit-from-racial-tipping-points/386674/ 1968] unintentional segregation continues to define neighborhoods today. 

==Solutions==
The Cedar Grove Institute for Sustainable Communities has developed a plan to fight institutionalized discrimination in the [[Mebane, North Carolina]] area, and included minorities in local planning that have historically been excluded rendering them insufficient [[police]] and [[fire protection]]. Their land values are lower than others leading to [[zoning]] for schools and other related issues. 

As community boundaries are not visible, a mapping process from the [[Geographical Information System]] (GIS) divides it. It combines several types of information into a single picture. The base map is physical features (roads, city limits, county boundaries) onto which other variables (e.g. race, income, water service, etc.). If needed, the processing system can also show other types of economic variables to draw conclusions about the area. Once the individuals begin to understand this information and realize what is happening to them, they have the power to hold the government accountable and can fight back against the institutionalized discrimination.&lt;ref name="Cedar Grove"&gt;{{cite web|author=Cedar Grove Institute for Sustainable Communities|title=Fighting Institutionalized Discrimination and Exclusion of Minorities|url=http://home.mindspring.com/~mcmoss/cedargrove/id11.html|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080704203828/http://home.mindspring.com/~mcmoss/cedargrove/id11.html|archive-date=2008-07-04|deadurl=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Jewish Anti-Zionist League''' ({{lang-fr|Ligue Juive contre le Sionisme "Egypte"}}, {{lang-ar|الرابطة الإسرائيلية لمكافحة الصهيونية}}, translit. ''ar-rabita al-israiliya li-mukafahat as-sahyuniya'') was a political organization in [[Egypt]]. The organization had branches in [[Alexandria]] and [[Cairo]]. The League conducted militant agitations in the Jewish neighbourhoods of Cairo.&lt;ref name="bei"/&gt;&lt;ref name="kra"&gt;[[Gudrun Krämer|Krämer, Gudrun]]. ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=n6qjaDq1sRwC The Jews in Modern Egypt, 1914-1952]''. London: I.B. Tauris, 1989. pp. 180-181&lt;/ref&gt;

The League was formed in the summer of 1946 by [[Jew]]ish members of the underground [[communist]] ''[[Iskra (Egyptian communist organisation)|Iskra]]'' movement.&lt;ref name="bei"/&gt; The founding Secretary of the Jewish Anti-Zionist League was Ezra Harari. Other members of the founding committee of the League were Marcel Israel, Edward Mataloun, Hanzin Kasfelt and Edward Levy. Immediately after the founding of the organization, the members of the founding committee were arrested.&lt;ref name="pal"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.palestineonly.net/ar/falasten/mostala7at_sahyoneyeh/88.htm|title=Minimize Your Risks Today Health Insurance NJ|date=2016-05-16|work=Palestine Only|access-date=2018-02-26|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;!-- Another early member of the Jewish Anti-Zionist League was Shehata Haroun, later a prominent politician in the [[National Progressive Unionist Party]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.daralhayat.com/culture/bookrevs/02-2008/Item-20080201-d5d1fe3f-c0a8-10ed-01dd-6f82209f1668/story.html&lt;/ref&gt; --&gt;

==Communist-Zionist clashes in Dahir==
In April 1947 a violent clash erupted as between the League and [[Zionism|Zionists]], as disputes erupted over the election to the leadership in the [[Daher, Egypt|Dahir]] [[Maccabi (sports)|Maccabi]] club. A slate of Zionist candidates won the election as result of manipulations and when the members of the Jewish Anti-Zionist League challenged the election outcome, the new club leadership called in police. In the clash, police forces sided with the Zionists and arrested the communists (considering the communists as a greater threat to public security than the Zionists).&lt;ref name="bei"/&gt;&lt;ref name="kra"/&gt; After the clash the communists reported the incident to the [[Wafd Party|Wafdist]] newspaper ''Sawt al-Ummah''.&lt;ref name="kra"/&gt;

On May 24, 1947, conflict again erupted at the Dahir Maccabi club, as Zionists refused the communists access to the building to celebrate [[International Workers' Day|May Day]]. Two days later another clash erupted at the club between Zionists and Jewish communists. Following these events, the League issued an editorial stating that Jewish schools were used for Zionist propaganda and that sports clubs used for Zionist organizing rather than sports activities.&lt;ref name="pal"/&gt;

==Positions==
The ambitions of the Jewish Anti-Zionist League were twofold. On one hand, it sought to counter the Zionist influence within the Jewish community in Egypt. On the other hand, it sought to clarify to the Egyptian public that not all Jews were Zionists.&lt;ref name="kra"/&gt;

In May 1947, the League had published a declaration, distributed in French and Arabic, condemning Zionism as a tool for British [[imperialism]] and called for Jewish-Arab unity. The latter part of the declaration read
&lt;blockquote&gt;Jewish Men! Jewish Women!

Zionism wants to throw us into a dangerous and hopeless adventure. Zionism contributes to making Palestine uninhabitable. Zionism wants to isolate us from the Egyptian people. Zionism is the enemy of the Jewish people.

Down with Zionism!
Long live the brotherhood of Jews and Arabs!
Long live the Egyptian people!&lt;ref name="kra"/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The League argued that displaced European Jews should be given the possibility to return to their home countries or third country of their choice, rather than sending them to Palestine.It also claimed that only an independent democratic Palestine would be able to break the bonds of colonialism and safeguard the Jewish people. The organization condemned [[Zionist terrorism|Zionist terrorist activity]] in Palestine.&lt;ref name="pal"/&gt;

==Banning==
In June 1947, the League was banned by the Egyptian Ministry for Social Affairs for "reasons of public security". Following the illegalization of the Jewish Anti-Zionist League, Harari founded the 'Forum Group'. The Forum Group was a Jewish anti-Zionist group within the [[Democratic Movement for National Liberation]]. According to contemporary British security reports, the Forum Group had a considerable following amongst the Jewish community in Cairo ([[Gudrun Krämer|Krämer]] does however question the accuracy of this estimate, stating that the group had a rather limited impact).&lt;ref name="bei"&gt;[[Joel Beinin|Beinin, Joel]].

In 2013, Cameron announced he would be the host of the film ''[[Unstoppable (2013 film)|Unstoppable]]'' slated to premiere September 24, 2013.

On April 11, 2012 Cameron was honored by [[Indiana Wesleyan University]], and inducted into their Society of World Changers during a ceremony in which he spoke on IWU's campus.&lt;ref name=IWU&gt;[http://www.indwes.edu/News/2012/Kirk-Cameron---Evangelist/Actor-Selected-as-IWU-s-Latest-World-Changer/ "Cameron Selected as latest IWU World Changer"] {{webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20120805231443/http://www.indwes.edu/News/2012/Kirk-Cameron---Evangelist/Actor-Selected-as-IWU-s-Latest-World-Changer/ |date=2012-08-05 }}. [[Indiana Wesleyan University]]. March 1, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Personal life==
Cameron and his wife, fellow ''Growing Pains'' star [[Chelsea Noble]], were married on July 21, 1991. They now have six children, four of whom were adopted: Jack (born 1996), Isabella (born 1997), Anna (born 1998), and Luke (born 2000); and two biological: Olivia (born 2001) and James (born 2003).&lt;ref name="TV"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://celebritybabies.people.com/2008/06/03/kirk-cameron/ |title=Kirk Cameron On His Kids: "I forgot who was adopted and who was not" |work=[[People.com]]. June 3, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Conversion to Christianity===
Cameron was an [[atheism|atheist]] in his early teens.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=Does God Exist? The Nightline Faceoff|journal=ABC News|author=Bashir, Martin|date=May 7, 2007|accessdate=April 4, 2009|url=http://abcnews.go.com/Nightline/Story?id=3148940}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{non-primary source needed|reason=A quote from Cameron himself in which he describes himself as a former atheist but in the same breath equates evolutionists with atheists is not a reliable source for the factual claim that he was an atheist. And technically, it doesn't mention "his early teens" anyway.|date=January 2018}} When he was 17, during the height of his career on ''Growing Pains'', he became a [[Born again (Christianity)|born-again Christian]].&lt;ref name="CToday"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.billoreilly.com/show?action=viewTVShow&amp;showID=758#7|title=Back of Book Segment|date=April 12, 2006|work=[[The O'Reilly Factor]] Flash|accessdate=December 8, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Way of the Master|last=Cameron|first=Kirk|author2=Ray Comfort|year=2004|publisher=[[Tyndale House|Tyndale House Publishers Inc.]]|isbn=1-4143-0061-1|page=Foreword|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ZTc6vclQWV0C&amp;printsec=frontcover#PPR7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After converting to Protestant Christianity, he began to insist that storylines be edited to remove anything he thought too adult or inappropriate in ''Growing Pains''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,469484,00.html|title=The Cast of 'Growing Pains:' Where Are They Now?|date=December 18, 2008|publisher=[[Fox News]]|accessdate=February 27, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After the series was cancelled, Cameron did not maintain contact with his former co-stars, and did not speak to [[Tracey Gold]] for eight years. Cameron has stated that this was not due to any animosity on his part toward any of his former cast-members, but an outgrowth of his desire to start a new life away from the entertainment industry, and the life he had been in for the previous seven years.&lt;ref name="LATimes"/&gt;

Prior to the premiere of ''[[The Growing Pains Movie]]'' in 2000, for which the entire main cast reunited, Cameron described his regrets over how his relationship with his castmates changed after his religious conversion during production of the series, saying, "I definitely kind of made an about-face, going toward another aspect of my life", admits Cameron. "I shifted my focus from 100% on the show, to 100% on [my new life], and left 0% on the show—and even the friendships that were a part of that show. If I could go back, I think I could make decisions that were less inadvertently hurtful to the cast—like talking and explaining to them why I just wanted to have my family at my wedding."&lt;ref name="LATimes"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://articles.latimes.com/2000/nov/03/entertainment/ca-46147|title=TV Family's Cast Gets Over Its Own 'Growing Pains'|last=Keck|first=William|date=November 3, 2000|work=[[Los Angeles Times]]|accessdate=December 8, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Lok Satta Movement.jpg|thumb|180px|right|Lok Satta Movement]]

'''Lok Satta''' is a non-partisan movement for [[Democracy|democratic]] reforms in the country of [[India]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.loksatta.org Lok Satta Party website&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; led by [[Jayaprakash Narayan (Lok Satta)|Dr. Jayaprakash Narayan]], a former [[Indian Administrative Service|I. A. S.]] officer and renowned activist from [[Andhra Pradesh]], [[India]]. The movement was started in 1996 with the founding of Lok Satta, a [[non-governmental organization]]. In 2006, the movement transformed into [[Lok Satta Party]].

== Introduction ==
The group declared to form a political party and contest in the upcoming elections. Though the movement initially started in [[Andhra Pradesh]], it later spread across the country. Dr. Jayaprakash Narayan says that [[democracy]] is for the people, of the people and  by  the people. Lok Satta is a registered society whose membership is open and available to all Indians.  It has district branches and neighbourhood units spread all over [[Andhra Pradesh]].  It has over 250,000 members in the state and over 30,000 in the Greater [[Hyderabad, Andhra Pradesh|Hyderabad]] region. While Lok Satta's goals are governance reforms in [[India]], its organizational spread is largely in [[Andhra Pradesh]].

==Activities==
Apart from creating India’s largest base for a people’s movement in Andhra Pradesh, Lok Satta is now deeply engaged in building a viable national platform for democratic reforms through building alliances in major states and promoting local initiatives, and building an effective and highly credible [[coalition]] at the national level specifically for electoral reforms. It has also launched its political party arm in October 2007,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.hindu.com/2006/10/16/stories/2006101604790600.htm | location=Chennai, India | work=The Hindu | title=Lok Satta's warning against corruption | date=2006-10-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.hindu.com/2006/11/07/stories/2006110704040400.htm | location=Chennai, India | work=The Hindu | title=Membership drive by Lok Satta | date=2006-11-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;  which has met with reasonable  success.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.hindu.com/2007/04/07/stories/2007040711850500.htm | location=Chennai, India | work=The Hindu | title=Lok Satta party gaining momentum | date=2007-04-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Goals===
*[[Democratization]] of political parties to make them open, member-controlled, transparent, and accountable in all aspects.
*[[Election|Electoral]] reforms to make elections truly democratic, fair and transparent; to facilitate and promote participation of the best men and women in India's political process; and to curb electoral mal-practices.
*Balanced distribution of functions between the union and the states and local governments, together with allocation of adequate resources and devolution of powers commensurate with their functions.
*Effective decentralization of governance through empowerment of local governments as participative tiers of [[constitution]]al, democratic governance, and direct empowerment of people as stakeholders wherever feasible.
*Effective functioning of legislature, executive and judiciary at all levels, with appropriate checks and balances.
*Measures for speedy, efficient, affordable, and accessible justice to people.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.hindu.com/2007/04/09/stories/2007040914360300.htm | location=Chennai, India | work=The Hindu | title=Lok Satta's public health agenda | date=2007-04-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*Measures to make bureaucracy truly accountable, responsive, and efficient at all levels.
*Institutional checks to prevent abuse of office, including [[freedom of information]] for transparent governance; insulation of crime investigation and prosecution from partisan pulls and political vagaries; creation of an effective, independent anti-corruption mechanism; and creation of an independent mechanism for appointment of constitutional functionaries.

===Principles===
According to Lok Satta, the specific reforms derived from the above generic principles must be in conformity with the following basic principles of democracy:
*[[Freedom (political)|Freedom]]
*[[Self-governance]]
*[[Empowerment]] of citizens
*[[Rule of law]]
*Self-correcting institutional mechanisms

The '''Marriage Alliance''' is an Australian lobby group based in Sydney, New South Wales which supports the definition of marriage between a man and a woman as found in the [[Marriage Act 1961 (Australia)#Marriage Amendment Act 2004|Marriage Amendment Act 2004]] .&lt;ref&gt;Under the [[Marriage Act 1961 (Australia)|Marriage Act 1961]] there was no specific definition of marriage until this 2004 amending act.&lt;/ref&gt; According to the group's website, it "is an independent alliance bringing together individuals and organisations supporting a common cause. We exist to voice the opinion of the silent majority of Australians that respect same-sex attracted people, but do not want to change the current definition of marriage."&lt;ref&gt;http://www.marriagealliance.com.au/about_us&lt;/ref&gt; They campaign against [[same-sex marriage]].

In November [[2018]] the group rebranded as ''[[Binary Australia]]'' with the stated aim to “carry on the fight for traditional values that celebrate the inherent differences between boys and girls, men and women”.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://junkee.com/marriage-alliance-binary-australia/184288|title=The Anti Marriage Equality Campaign Has Rebranded As "Binary Australia" To Shit On Trans People|date=2018-11-28|work=Junkee|access-date=2018-11-28|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.binary.org.au/|title=Binary|work=Binary|access-date=2018-11-28|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Campaigns==
Marriage Alliance partnered with the [[Coalition for Marriage (Australia)|Coalition for Marriage]] and other groups opposed to same-sex marriage, to campaign for a 'No' vote in the 2017 [[Australian Marriage Law Postal Survey]].

They have conducted an extensive and controversial anti-gay marriage campaign in the media and on social media:
* Ads initially accepted for broadcast by Channels 7 and 10, with management of those channels later deciding to not do so,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.abc.net.au/mediawatch/transcripts/s4295137.htm, (17 August 2015), Media equality on marriage equality?, ABC], retrieved 6 November 2016&lt;/ref&gt; were subsequently, and controversially, broadcast by Foxtel.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.news.com.au/national/breaking-news/foxtel-lashed-for-anti-gay-marriage-ads/news-story/5fdcba0260c1ccf1c5452f17a1af94c7, (10 August 2015), Foxtel lashed for anti-gay marriage ads, news.com.au], retrieved 22 October 2016&lt;/ref&gt;

The women(who all have had children killed by police brutally) have attended many conventions to spread awareness of the crisis that is police brutality in the United States. They are using their grief to rally involvement in communities and highlight the injustice they've endured with the lost of their children's lives. They also talk about life after loss, the five stages of grief( denial, anger, bargaining, depression, and acceptance), and how to move forward after a traumatic event.

== Political Activism ==


=== 2016 Democratic National Convention ===

Seven women from the group—Gwen Carr, mother of [[Eric Garner]]; Sybrina Fulton, mother of [[Trayvon Martin]]; Maria Hamilton, mother of [[Dontre Hamilton]]; [[Lucy McBath]], mother of [[Shooting of Jordan Davis|Jordan Davis]]; Lezley McSpadden, mother of [[Shooting of Michael Brown|Michael Brown]], Cleopatra Pendleton-Cowley, mother of [[Hadiya Pendleton]]; and Geneva Reed-Veal, mother of [[Sandra Bland]]—spoke in support of Clinton's candidacy for President during the July [[2016 Democratic National Convention]] in Philadelphia. Clinton had reached out privately the previous November to meet with the women. The Mothers of the Movement subsequently joined Clinton on the campaign trail to support her candidacy and advocate for an end to these killings.

Samaria Rice, the mother of [[Tamir Rice]], did not join the other mothers in their endorsement of Hillary Clinton. She did not see an acceptable level of commitment against police brutality from any of the candidates and therefore withheld her endorsement. She did support the other mothers, saying in an interview with [[Fusion (TV channel)|Fusion]], "I hope they going to hold her accountable for whatever discussions they had behind closed doors."

The Mothers of the Movement have been criticized for being used by the Clinton campaign, but members deny this claim.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.wschronicle.com/2016/09/mothers-movement-urge-blacks-vote/|title=Mothers of the Movement Urge Blacks to Vote|last=Michaels|first=Cash|date=|website=The Chronicle|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''National Restoration Party''' (''{{lang-es|Partido Restauración Nacional}}'' – PRN) is a political party in [[Costa Rica]].

The party's candidate in the [[Costa Rican general election, 2014|presidential election of 2014]] was Avendaño, who received 1.35 percent of the vote.&lt;ref&gt;[http://svr.tse.go.cr/aplicacionvisualizador/pdfs/e88e50d285bef1250fbac75ff2561e33.pdf Resultados Electorales: Total General] Tribunal Supremo de Elecciones. 2014-02-17. {{es}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the same year's [[Costa Rican general election, 2014|parliamentary election]], [[Gerardo Fabricio Alvarado Muñoz]], representing [[San José Province|San José]], was elected to the only seat in the [[Legislative Assembly of Costa Rica|Legislative Assembly]] that was won by the party.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.asamblea.go.cr/Diputadas_Diputados/Documents/Declatoria_diputados_2014-2018.pdf Declaratoria de elección de Diputados a la Asamblea Legislativa de la República de Costa Rica 2014-2018] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304090239/http://www.asamblea.go.cr/Diputadas_Diputados/Documents/Declatoria_diputados_2014-2018.pdf |date=2016-03-04 }} Tribunal Supremo de Elecciones, 2014-03-03. {{es}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[Costa Rican general election, 2018|2018 Costa Rican general elections]] the party when it won 14 of the parliament seats and its presidential candidate, [[Fabricio Alvarado]], went in to the runoff.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.bbc.com/news/world-latin-america-42938510&lt;/ref&gt; According to the BBC, his campaign gained in popularity because of his opposition to [[same-sex marriage]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Costa Rica election: Gay marriage debate dominates campaign|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-latin-america-42938510|date=4 February 2018|accessdate=4 February 2018|work=BBC News Online|page=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-latin-america-42938510}}&lt;/ref&gt; The party also holds anti-inmigration positions and calls for closed borders and harsher controls on migrants.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Chinchilla |first1=Aaron |title=Restauración Nacional exige al Gobierno reforzar controles migratorios en Peñas Blancas |agency=El Periódico |date=25 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Controversies==

In March 2018, the newspaper ''Semanario Universidad'' reported that high figures of the party had billed several million [[Costa Rican colón|colones]] for professional services for participating in their own campaign such as the beneficiaries' own candidate, Fabricio Alvarado, his wife, his brothers, his two vice-presidential nominees, two sons, and the ex-wife of the party president, [[https://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carlos_Avendano_Calvo|Carlos Avendaño]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Murillo|first1=Alvaro|last2=Miranda|first2=Hulda|last3=Salazar|first3=Daniel|title=Restauración reporta al TSE pagos a Fabricio y sus vicepresidentes por alquilar carros a la campaña|url=https://semanariouniversidad.com/pais/restauracion-reporta-al-tse-pagos-a-fabricio-y-sus-vicepresidentes-por-alquilar-carros-a-la-campana/|accessdate=25 May 2018|agency=Semanario Universidad|date=27 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was later discovered that one of the beneficiaries, the son of Avendaño, had received professional services for working for the party while he was incapacitated by health from his official work at the [[Costa Rican Institute of Electricity]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Hijo de diputado trabajo para restauracion|url=https://www.nacion.com/el-pais/politica/hijo-de-diputado-trabajo-para-restauracion/SR5HWZAOCVH63BILIYHXV7A7WY/story/|accessdate=25 May 2018|agency=La Nación}}&lt;/ref&gt; In May 2018, it was reported that the party had hired the polling company OPol, according to financial reports submitted to the [[Tribunal Supremo de Elecciones de Costa Rica|Supreme Electoral Tribunal]]. Although party officials originally reported that they were political consultancies unrelated to the polls, subsequent investigations by the newspaper ''[[La Nación (Costa Rica)|La Nación]]'' discovered a contract for the payment of the six surveys that were conducted during the second round campaign, five of which were published and all of which Alvarado appeared as frontrunner by a large margin.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Cambronero|first1=Natasha|title=Encuestas de Opol se hicieron por encargo de Restauración Nacional de cara a la segunda ronda|url=https://www.nacion.com/el-pais/politica/encuestas-de-opol-se-hicieron-por-encargo-de/67BL2AJD2FGCPHG7CMMIPTCXFU/story/|accessdate=25 May 2018|agency=La Nación|date=25 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Previously, the pollster had already been in controversy after it was reported on social networks that a company vehicle driven by director Mauricio Muñoz, had carried party flags.

In late May, Avendaño himself filed a complaint with the Supreme Electoral Tribunal for what he called a "parallel structure" made up of the campaign team of the candidate for hiring outside the ethical controls stipulated by the party that would have been the one that negotiated those and other payments.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Cambronero|first1=Natasha|last2=Sequeira|first2=Aarón|title=Carlos Avendaño denuncia 'estructura paralela' en financiamiento de campaña de Fabricio Alvarado|url=https://www.nacion.com/el-pais/politica/carlos-avendano-denuncia-estructura-paralela-en/WKZSHZK5K5GN7KXXIHJXMBPUPY/story/|accessdate=30 May 2018|agency=La Nación|date=29 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Oviedo|first1=Esteban|last2=Cambronero|first2=Natasha|last3=Sequeira|first3=Aarón|title=Empresa de cantante reclama ¢115 millones a Restauración y anuncia demanda en tribunales|url=https://www.nacion.com/el-pais/politica/empresa-de-cantante-reclama-115-millones-a/EEVZTURINFDNDOWK2YKRVBAQJY/story/|accessdate=30 May 2018|agency=La Nación}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Nós–Unidade Popular''' (''We–People's Unity'') was a [[Galicia (Spain)|Galician]] [[Left-wing politics|left-wing]] [[Galician nationalism|Galician independentist]] political party. It was formed by the merger of [[Assembleia da Mocidade Independentista]], [[Primeira Linha]] and other organizations. Nós–UP never gained any institutional representation. The party announced its self-dissolution in June 2015.

==Activities==
In 2004, the party contested the [[European Parliament|European Parliamentary]] elections, obtaining 1,331 votes in Galicia (0.12%) and 2,516 votes in [[Spain]]. In the Galician elections of 2005, 1,749 votes (0.1%) were obtained. In 2005, the party organized a campaign to eliminate symbolic vestiges of [[Spain under Franco|Francoist rule]] from Galicia, presenting their concerns to the [[Xunta de Galicia]]. During some demonstrations associated with this campaign, Nós-UP party members were arrested. The current leader is {{Interlanguage link multi|Carlos Morais (politician)|gl|3=Carlos Morais|lt=Carlos Morais}}.

'''Pentarchy of 1933''', formally known as the '''Executive Commission of the Provisional Government of Cuba''', was a coalition that ruled Cuba from September 5 to September 10, 1933 after [[Gerardo Machado]] was deposed on August 12, 1933.  Prior to the Pentarchy, General [[Alberto Herrera y Franchi|Alberto Herrera]] (August 12–13, 1933) and [[Carlos Manuel de Céspedes y Quesada]] (August 13 - September 5, 1933) served as [[President of Cuba]].

The members of the Pentarchy were:
* Sergio Carbó y Morera (1891–1971), journalist
* Porfirio Franca y Álvarez de la Campa (1878–1950), attorney, banker and economist
* [[Ramón Grau]] San Martín (1887–1969), faculty member at the [[University of Havana]] School of Medicine
* José Miguel Irisarri y Gamio (1895–1968), an attorney
* Guillermo Portela y Möller (1886–1958), faculty member at the University of Havana School of Law

The first thing the Pentarchy did was to draft a proclamation which was written by Sergio Carbó and signed by eighteen civilians and one military man, [[Fulgencio Batista]].  That proclamation was published in every Cuban newspaper the following day. Carbó later promoted Batista from a sergeant to colonel without notifying the other four.  Later they were ousted by the [[Directorio Estudiantil Universitario|Student Directory]] and Ramón Grau was named president.

==Attempts to overthrow the Pentarchy==
U.S. ambassador to Cuba [[Sumner Welles]] noted in a telegram to the Secretary of State that late at night on September 6, 1933, Dr. Horacio Ferrer, Secretary of War in the [[Carlos Manuel de Céspedes y Quesada]] Cabinet, called to see him. He advised the ambassador that he was in contact with sergeants in control of the Fortress [[La Cabaña]] who advised Ferrer that they were deceived in participating in the mutiny and that they were prepared to make any reparation for their action. Ferrer's plan would be as follows, after taking some preliminary measures, Ferrer, accompanied with 80 loyal officers would proceed on September 8, 1933 to the Fortress [[La Cabaña]] with President Cespedes and several other members of his Cabinet and that on early morning September 9, 1933, Ferrer would proclaim the support of the Fortress to the legitimate Government of President Cespedes. Ferrer would then ask the ambassador whether “''should this action be taken, and should Cespedes Government make such request the Government of the United States would be willing to land troops from the battleships now due to arrive at Cojimar immediately to the east of Cabaña Fortress, in order to assist the Cespedes Government in maintaining order''.”&lt;ref&gt;Foreign Relations of the United States: Diplomatic Papers, 1933. The American Republics: Volume V,p. 396 http://images.library.wisc.edu/FRUS/EFacs/1933v05/reference/frus.frus1933v05.i0010.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Sumner Welles]] himself supported Ferrer and advised Washington of the following: "''What I propose would be a strictly limited intervention of the following nature...entail the landing of a consider force at [[Havana]] and lesser forces in certain of the more important ports of the Republic''."`

The [[Franklin Delano Roosevelt]] administration was reluctant, however, to any form of direct military intervention as noted in the following telegram in response to [[Sumner Welles]]'s telegram proposing the "limited intervention." The Secretary of State, [[Cordell Hull]] on September 7, 1933 at 8pm noted as follows to [[Sumner Welles]], "''Your 206 September 6, noon. We fully appreciate the various viewpoints set forth in your telegram. However, after mature consideration, the President has decided to send you the following message:

"''We feel very strongly that any promise, implied or otherwise, relating to what the United States will do under any circumstances is impossible; that it would be regarded as a breach of neutrality, as favoring one faction out of many, as attempting to set up a government which would be regarded by the whole world, and especially throughout Latin America, as a creation and creature of the American government...strict neutrality is of the essence''."&lt;ref&gt;Foreign Relations of the United States: Diplomatic Papers, 1933. The American Republics: Volume V,p. 402 http://images.library.wisc.edu/FRUS/EFacs/1933v05/reference/frus.frus1933v05.i0010.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to Dr. Ferrer's attempt overthrow the new revolutionary government, there was also the Cuban Army on behalf of Batista seeking to make back-deals with Cespedes. As reported by [[Sumner Welles]] to the U.S. Secretary of State on September 9, 1933, " ''A commission of sergeants visited [former] President [[Carlos Manuel de Cespedes y Quesada]] this morning in his house to inform him that Colonel, former Sergeant, [[Fulgencio Batista]] was willing to support his restoration to the Presidency provided President Cespedes would confirm him in his position as Colonel and Chief of Staff of the Army and guarantee his safety and that of his associates in this mutiny. President Cespedes stated that he was unwilling to make any commitments whatever as to what would be done provided he was reinstated in power''."&lt;ref&gt;Foreign Relations of the United States: Diplomatic Papers, 1933. The American Republics: Volume V,p. 414 http://images.library.wisc.edu/FRUS/EFacs/1933v05/reference/frus.frus1933v05.i0010.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Wik Pilchowo śmieci SDC17203.JPG|thumb|Plastic Recycling bin in [[Poland]]]]'''Plastic recycling''' is the process of recovering [[scrap]] or [[plastic waste|waste]] [[plastic]] and reprocessing the material into useful products. Since the vast majority of plastic is non-[[Biodegradation|biodegradable]], [[recycling]] is a part of global efforts to reduce plastic in the waste stream, especially the approximately 8 million tons of waste plastic that enters the Earth's ocean every year.&lt;ref name=HardestyWilcox&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Hardesty, Britta Denise  |author2=Chris Wilcox|title=8 million tons of plastic are going into the ocean each year|journal=The Conversation|date=13 February 2015|url=http://theconversation.com/eight-million-tonnes-of-plastic-are-going-into-the-ocean-each-year-37521|access-date=21 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Jambeck1&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Jambeck, Jenna|first1=Science 13 February 2015: Vol. 347 no. 6223|title=Plastic waste inputs from land into the ocean|journal=Science|volume=347|issue=6223|pages=768–771|doi=10.1126/science.1260352|pmid=25678662|url=http://www.sciencemag.org/content/347/6223/768|access-date=21 February 2015|display-authors=etal|year=2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Compared with lucrative recycling of [[metal]], and similar to the low value of [[glass]], plastic polymers recycling is often more challenging because of low density and low value. There are also numerous technical hurdles to overcome when recycling plastic.

When different [[types of plastic]]s are melted together, they tend to [[phase-separate]], like oil and water, and set in these layers. The [[phase boundary|phase boundaries]] cause structural weakness in the resulting material, meaning that [[polymer blend]]s are useful in only limited applications. The two most widely manufactured plastics, [[polypropylene]] and [[polyethylene]], behave this way, which limits their utility for recycling. Recently, the use of [[Copolymer#Block copolymers|block copolymers]] as "molecular stitches"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Creton C|title=Molecular stitches for enhanced recycling of packaging|journal=Science|date=February 24, 2017|volume=355|issue=6327|pages=797-798|doi=10.1126/science.aam5803}}&lt;/ref&gt; or "macromolecular welding flux" has been proposed&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Eagan JM et al|title=Combining polyethylene and polypropylene: Enhanced performance with PE/iPP multiblock polymers|journal=Science|date=February 24, 2017|volume=355|issue=6327|pages=814-816|doi=10.1126/science.aah5744}}&lt;/ref&gt; to overcome the difficulties associated with phase separation during recycling.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Fleischman T|title=Polymer additive could revolutionize plastics recycling|url=http://www.news.cornell.edu/stories/2017/02/polymer-additive-could-revolutionize-plastics-recycling|website=cornell.edu|publisher=Cornell University|access-date=23 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The percentage of plastic that can be fully recycled, rather than downcycled or go to waste, can be increased when manufacturers of packaged goods minimize mixing of packaging materials and eliminate contaminants. The Association of Plastics Recyclers have issued a "Design Guide for Recyclability".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.plasticsrecycling.org/images/pdf/design-guide/PET_APR_Design_Guide.pdf|title=PET_APR_Design_Guide.pdf|author=|first=|date=|website=PlasticsRecycling.org|access-date=13 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Today, there are many places available where people can [http://blog.hedwin.com/blog/5-easy-tips-for-more-efficient-plastic-recycling recycle plastic products].

==Processes==
Before recycling, most plastics are sorted according to their resin type. In the past, plastic reclaimers used the [[resin identification code]] (RIC), a method of categorization of polymer types, which was developed by the [[Society of the Plastics Industry]] in 1988.{{cn|date=December 2017}} [[Polyethylene terephthalate]], commonly referred to as PET, for instance, has a resin code of 1.  Most plastic reclaimers do not rely on the RIC now; they use automatic sort systems to identify the resin, ranging from manual sorting and picking of plastic materials to mechanized automation processes that involve shredding, sieving, separation by rates of density i.e. air, liquid, or magnetic, and complex spectrophotometric distribution technologies e.g. UV/VIS, NIR, Laser, etc.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.plasticseurope.org/plastics-sustainability-14017/zero-plastics-to-landfill/waste-pre-treatment-and-sorting.aspx Plastics Europe: Association of Plastics Manufacturers. ''Waste Pre-Treatment and Sorting''. Retrieved 8 July 2015]&lt;/ref&gt; Some plastic products are also separated by color before they are recycled.  The plastic recyclables are then shredded.  These shredded fragments then undergo processes to eliminate impurities like paper labels.  This material is melted and often [[extrude]]d into the form of pellets which are then used to manufacture other products.

Given below is the list of suitable plastic raw materials for pyrolysis:
* Mixed plastic (HDPE, LDPE, PE, PP, Nylon, Teflon, PS, ABS, FRP  etc.)
* Mixed-waste plastic from waste paper mill
* Multi-layered plastic

===Heat compression===
Heat compression takes all unsorted, cleaned plastic in all forms, from soft plastic bags to hard [[industrial waste]], and mixes the load in tumblers (large rotating drums resembling giant [[clothes dryer]]s). The most obvious benefit to this method is that all plastic is recyclable, not just matching forms. However, criticism rises from the energy costs of rotating the drums, and heating the post-melt pipes.&lt;ref&gt;
[http://recyclenation.com/green-glossary/heat-compression recyclenation.com]&lt;/ref&gt;

====Distributed recycling====
For some waste plastics, technical devices called [[recyclebot]]s&lt;ref name="RPJ"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Baechler | first1 = Christian | last2 = DeVuono | first2 = Matthew | last3 = Pearce | first3 = Joshua M. | year = 2013 | title = Distributed Recycling of Waste Polymer into RepRap Feedstock | doi = 10.1108/13552541311302978 | journal = Rapid Prototyping Journal | volume = 19 | issue = 2| pages = 118–125 }}&lt;/ref&gt; enable a form of distributed recycling. Preliminary [[life-cycle analysis]](LCA) indicates that such distributed recycling of [[HDPE]] to make filament of [[3-D printers]] in rural regions is energetically favorable to either using virgin resin or conventional recycling processes because of reductions in transportation energy&lt;ref name="LCA"&gt;M.

===Other processes===
[[File:Polymer compatibilization.png|thumb|Plastic or other polymer compatibilization]]
A process has also been developed in which many kinds of plastic can be used as a [[carbon]] source in the recycling of scrap [[steel]].&lt;ref&gt;
[http://www.cnn.com/2005/TECH/08/10/plastic.steel.reut/index.html Steel. CNN. 10 August 2005. Retrieved 9.11.06.]&lt;/ref&gt; There is also a possibility of mixed recycling of different plastics, which does not require their separation. It is called compatibilization and requires use of special chemical bridging agents compatibilizers. It can help to keep the quality of recycled material and to skip often expensive and inefficient preliminary scanning of waste plastics streams and their separation/purification.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Ignatyev | first1 = I.A. | last2 = Thielemans | first2 = W. | last3 = Beke | first3 = B.

==Applications==

===PET===
{{main article|PET bottle recycling}}
Post-consumer [[polyethylene terephthalate]] (PET or PETE) containers are sorted into different color fractions and baled for onward sale.  PET recyclers further sort the baled bottles and they are washed and flaked (or flaked and then washed).  Non-PET fractions such as caps and labels are removed during this process.  The clean flake is dried.  Further treatment can take place e.g. melt filtering and pelletizing or various treatments to produce food-contact-approved recycled PET (RPET).

RPET has been widely used to produce polyester fibres.&lt;ref name="eartheasy1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eartheasy.com/wear_ecospun.htm |title=EcoSpun (Eco-fi) Clothing - Eartheasy.com Solutions for Sustainable Living |publisher=Eartheasy.com |date= |access-date=21 August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; This sorted post-consumer PET waste is crushed, chopped into flakes, pressed into bales, and offered for sale.&lt;ref name="innovations-report1"&gt;{{cite web|author=Idea TV GmbH |url=http://www.innovations-report.com/html/reports/environment_sciences/report-7183.html |title=Recycled plastic - the fashion fabric of the future |publisher=Innovations-report.com |date= |access-date=21 August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One use for this recycled PET is to create fabrics to be used in the [[clothing industry]].&lt;ref name="thisisbrandx1"&gt;{{cite web |author=PT, November 13, 2009 |url=http://www.thisisbrandx.com/2009/11/trashy-chic-recycled-clothing-from-playback.html |title=Trashy Chic: Recycled clothing from Playback - Brand X |publisher=Thisisbrandx.com |date=13 November 2009 |access-date=21 August 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100108231125/http://www.thisisbrandx.com/2009/11/trashy-chic-recycled-clothing-from-playback.html |archivedate=8 January 2010 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The fabrics are created by spinning the PET flakes into thread and yarn.&lt;ref name="innovations-report1"/&gt; This is done just as easily as creating polyester from brand new PET.&lt;ref name="rewarestore1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rewarestore.com/tech_recycled_pet.html |title=Reware's REWOVEN Technology Info: The Eco Narrative - Recycled PET |publisher=RewareStore.com |date= |access-date=21 August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The recycled PET thread or yarn can be used either alone or together with other fibers to create a very wide variety of fabrics. Traditionally these fabrics are used to create strong, durable, rough products, such as jackets, coats, shoes, bags, hats, and accessories since they are usually too rough for direct skin contact and can cause irritation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sustainableisgood.com/products/2008/04/billabong.html |title=Billabong ECO Supreme Suede Boardshorts: Sustainable is Good Eco Products |publisher=SustainableIsGood.com |date=9 April 2008 |access-date=21 August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, these types of fabrics have become more popular as a result of the public's growing awareness of environmental issues. Numerous fabric and clothing manufacturers have capitalized on this trend.{{Citation needed|date=July 2017}}

Other major outlets for RPET are new containers (food-contact or non-food-contact) produced either by (injection stretch blow) moulding into bottles and jars or by thermoforming APET sheet to produce clamshells, blister packs and collation trays.  These applications used 46% of all RPET produced in Europe in 2010.{{citation needed|date=March 2013}} Other applications, such as strapping tape, injection-moulded engineering components and building materials, account for 13% of the 2010 RPET production.{{citation needed|date=March 2013}}

In the United States, the recycling rate for PET packaging was 31.2% in 2013, according to a report from The National Association for PET Container Resources (NAPCOR) and The Association of Postconsumer Plastic Recyclers (APR). A total of 1,798 million pounds was collected and 475 million pounds of recycled PET used out of a total of 5,764 million pounds of PET bottles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.plasticstoday.com/articles/recycling-for-PET-packaging-reaches-31-percent-in-2013-141008|title=Recycling for PET packaging reaches 31 percent in 2013|work=PlasticsToday|access-date=12 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===HDPE===
Plastic #2, high-density polyethylene ([[HDPE]]) is a commonly recycled plastic. HDPE's highly crystalline structure makes it a strong, high density, moderately stiff plastic. HDPE Thermoplastic materials become liquid at their melting point - around 130 degrees Celsius. A major benefit of thermoplastics is that they can be heated to melting point, cooled, and reheated again without significant degradation. Instead of burning, thermoplastics like PE (Polyethylene) liquefy, allowing them to be easily extruded or [injection molded] and turned into brand new [&lt;nowiki/&gt;[[HDPE pipe]]]. Often it is typically [[Downcycling|downcycled]] into [[plastic lumber]], tables, roadside curbs, benches, truck cargo liners, trash receptacles, stationery (e.g. rulers) and other durable plastic products and is usually in demand &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://polywaste.com.au/|title=Poly Waste HDPE Recycling Website|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

===PS===
[[File:Symbol Resin Code 6 PS.svg|thumb|90px|The resin identification code symbol for polystyrene&lt;!--The [[Unicode]] character is U+2678, which will appear here if you have a suitable font installed: &lt;span style="font-size:250%;"&gt;♸&lt;/span&gt;.--&gt;]]

Most polystyrene products are not recycled due to the lack of incentive to invest in the compactors and logistical systems required. As a result, manufacturers cannot obtain sufficient scrap. Expanded polystyrene (EPS) scrap can easily be added to products such as EPS insulation sheets and other EPS materials for construction applications. When it is not used to make more EPS, foam scrap can be turned into clothes hangers, park benches, flower pots, toys, rulers, stapler bodies, seedling containers, picture frames, and architectural molding from recycled PS.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://pspc.intoweb.co.za/index.php?page=recycle1|title="Polystyrene recycling". Polystyrene Packaging Council. Retrieved 6 March 2009.|author=|date=|website=Intoweb.co.za|access-date=13 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Recycled EPS is also used in many metal casting operations. [[Rastra]] is made from EPS that is combined with cement to be used as an insulating amendment in the making of concrete foundations and walls.  Since 1993, American manufacturers have produced insulating concrete forms made with approximately 80% recycled EPS.{{Citation needed|date=July 2017}}

===Other plastics===
The white plastic polystyrene [[foam peanut]]s used as packing material are often accepted by shipping stores for reuse.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.allbusiness.com/consumer-products/office-supplies-equipment/6916130-1.html |title=Let Peanuts Live!

Successful trials in [[Israel]] have shown that plastic films recovered from mixed municipal waste streams can be recycled into useful household products such as [[bucket]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.oaktech-environmental.com/plastictrials.htm|title="Plastic trial procedure".

[[CNN]] reports that Dr. S. Madhu of the [[Kerala]] Highway Research Institute, [[India]], has formulated a road surface that includes recycled plastic: aggregate, [[bitumen]] (asphalt) with plastic that has been shredded and melted at a temperature below 220 degrees C (428&amp;nbsp;°F) to avoid pollution.  This road surface is claimed to be very durable and monsoon rain resistant.  The plastic is sorted by hand, which is economical in India. The test road used 60&amp;nbsp;kg of plastic for an approximately 500-metre-long, 8-metre-wide, two-lane road.  The process chops thin-film road-waste into a light fluff of tiny flakes that hot-mix plants can uniformly introduce into viscous bitumen with a customized dosing machine.  Tests at both Bangalore and the Indian Road Research Centre indicate that roads built using this 'KK process' will have longer useful lives and better resistance to cold, heat, cracking, and rutting, by a factor of three.&lt;ref name=ISEBIndia&gt;{{citation|title=Plastics Recycling and The Need For Bio-Polymers |last=Patel |first=Almitra H. |agency= International Society of Environmental Botanists |publisher= EnviroNews Archives |volume=9 |number=4 |date=October 2003 |url= http://isebindia.com/01_04/03-10-2.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Recycling rates==
The quantity of post-consumer plastics recycled has increased every year since at least 1990, but rates lag far behind those of other items, such as newspaper (about 80%) and [[corrugated fiberboard]] (about 70%).&lt;ref&gt;The Self-Sufficiency Handbook: A Complete Guide to Greener Living by Alan Bridgewater pg. 62--Skyhorse Publishing Inc., 2007 {{ISBN|1-60239-163-7}}, {{ISBN|978-1-60239-163-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; Overall, U.S. post-consumer [[plastic waste]] for 2008 was estimated at 33.6 million tons; 2.2 million tons (6.5%) were recycled and 2.6 million tons (7.7%) were burned for energy; 28.9 million tons, or 85.5%, were discarded in landfills.&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite news|url=http://journalistsresource.org/studies/environment/energy/energy-non-recycled-plastics-landfill/|title="Energy and Economic Value of Non-recycled Plastics and Municipal Solid Wastes" at Journalist's Resource.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As of 2015, approximately 6300 million tons of plastic waste had been generated, around 9% of which had been recycled, 12% was incinerated, and 79% was accumulated in landfills or the natural environment.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://advances.sciencemag.org/content/3/7/e1700782|title=Science Advances|last=Geyer|first=Roland|date=19 July 2017|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2016 only 14% of plastic waste was recycled globally.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.ellenmacarthurfoundation.org/news/the-new-plastics-economy-rethinking-the-future-of-plastics-infographics|title=The new plastic economy rethinking the future of plastics|last=Ellen MacArthur Foundation|first=|date=19 January 2016|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Japan's plastic waste utilization rate stood at 83% in 2014, up from 73% in 2006 and 39% in 1996, according to the nation's Plastic Waste Management Institute.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.pwmi.or.jp/ei/index.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

==Economic and energy potential==
In 2008, the price of PET dropped from $370/ton in the US to $20 in November.&lt;ref&gt;Page, Candace, Waste district raises recycling fees, ''Burlington Free Press'', November 12, 2008&lt;/ref&gt; PET prices had returned to their long-term averages by May 2009.&lt;ref&gt;''Financial Times'', May 15, 2009 (article by Max Hogg)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Plastic identification code==
{{main article|Resin identification code}}
Seven groups of plastic polymers,&lt;ref name="singapore"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://recyclemonthly.com/blogs/topsecret/recycling-tips-3-how-to-recycle-the-7-types-of-plastic-used-for-packaging|title=How to Recycle the 7 types of plastic used for packaging.|last=|first=|date=|website=RecycleMonthly|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; each with specific properties, are used worldwide for packaging applications (see table below). Each group of plastic polymer can be identified by its plastic identification code (PIC), usually a number or a letter abbreviation. For instance, low-density polyethylene can be identified by the number "4" or the letters "LDPE". The PIC appears inside a three-chasing-arrow recycling symbol. The symbol is used to indicate whether the plastic can be recycled into new products.{{citation needed|date=September 2011}}

The PIC was introduced by the Society of the Plastics Industry, Inc., to provide a uniform system for the identification of various polymer types and to help recycling companies separate various plastics for reprocessing. Manufacturers of plastic products are required to use PIC labels in some countries/regions and can voluntarily mark their products with the PIC where there are no requirements.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Holt Chemistry ([[Florida]] edition)|publisher=[[Holt, Rinehart, and Winston]]|year=2006|isbn=0-03-039114-8|chapter=19|page=702|quote=More than half the states in the United States have enacted laws that require plastic products to be labeled with numerical codes that identify the type of plastic used in them.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Consumers can identify the plastic types based on the codes usually found at the base or at the side of the plastic products, including food/chemical packaging and containers. The PIC is usually not present on packaging films, since it is not practical to collect and recycle most of this type of waste.{{clarify|date=September 2011}}{{citation needed|date=September 2011}}

===United States===
Low national plastic recycling rates have been due to the complexity of sorting and processing, unfavorable economics, and consumer confusion about which plastics can actually be recycled.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title=Where can we put all those plastics? |work=Seattle Times  | url=http://seattletimes.nwsource.com/html/homegarden/2003730398_ecoconsumer02.html| access-date=2 June 2007 | first=Tom | last=Watson | date=June 2, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; Part of the confusion has been due to the use of the [[resin identification code]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.americanchemistry.com/s_plastics/bin.asp?CID=1102&amp;DID=4645&amp;DOC=FILE.PDF|title=Page Not Found|author=|date=|website=www.AmericanChemistry.com|access-date=13 July 2017|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110721103005/http://www.americanchemistry.com/s_plastics/bin.asp?CID=1102&amp;DID=4645&amp;DOC=FILE.PDF|archivedate=21 July 2011|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; which is not on all plastic parts but just a subset&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.plasticsindustry.org/AboutPlastics/content.cfm?ItemNumber=823|title=SPI Resin Identification Code - Guide to Correct Use|author=|date=|website=PlasticsIndustry.org|access-date=13 July 2017|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130516032146/http://www.plasticsindustry.org/AboutPlastics/content.cfm?ItemNumber=823|archivedate=16 May 2013|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; that includes the [[recycling symbol]] as part of its design. The resin identification code is stamped or printed on the bottom of containers and surrounded by a triangle of arrows. (See the table in [[Plastic]].) The intent of these symbols was to make it easier to identify the type of plastics used to make a particular container and to indicate that the plastic is potentially recyclable. The question that remains is which types of plastics can be recycled by local recycling centers. In many communities, not all types of plastics are accepted for sidewalk recycling collection programs due to the high processing costs and complexity of the equipment required to recycle certain materials. There is also sometimes a seemingly low demand for the recycled product depending on a recycling center's proximity to entities seeking recycled materials. Another major barrier is that the cost to recycle certain materials and the corresponding market price for those materials sometimes does not present any opportunity for profit. The best example of this is polystyrene (commonly called styrofoam), although some communities, like [[Brookline, Massachusetts]], are moving toward banning the distribution of polystyrene containers by local food and coffee businesses.&lt;ref&gt; [http://seattletimes.nwsource.com/html/homegarden/2003730398_ecoconsumer02.html "Where can we put all those plastics?"

&lt;!--[[File:Autosan policja.jpg|thumb|Polish police coach used for prisoner transport.]]--&gt;
[[File:United States Marshals Service Special-production.jpg|thumb|[[United States Marshals Service|United States Marshals]] securing an [[U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement|immigration and customs]] prisoner transport.]]

'''Prisoner transport''' is the transportation of [[prison]]ers by [[Law enforcement agency|law enforcement agencies]] or [[Prisoner Transportation Services|contractors.]]

In order to [[Extradition|extradite]] a suspected or convicted criminal from one jurisdiction to another, a [[rendition aircraft]] may be used, although the high cost involved means that it is normally used only to transport the most dangerous of prisoners; more commonly, a person being extradited would simply be put onto a commercial [[airliner]], albeit escorted by law enforcement officers.

== Issues ==
Prisoner transport is risky due to the fact the dangerous inmates are being temporarily brought into the public along with the civilian population. Specially designed [[prisoner transport vehicle]]s are used to fulfill security requirements. Many inmates see this time as an opportunity to escape. Some inmates prepare for escape during transport by bringing along tiny objects (e.g. [[paper clip]]s that can be used to pick the locks of their handcuffs prior to escape from the vehicles.

Law enforcement agencies, aware of this, often take extra security measures on inmates being transported, especially those who are more prone to escape or violence. This includes additional forms of restraint on the bodies, more secure vehicles, and escorts from additional law enforcement agents. Many transports are started at night to minimize the chance of harm to civilians.

=== Restraints ===
[[File:"blue box" handcuff cover 02.jpg|thumb|Prisoner in hancuffs with a handcuff cover, secured with a martin chain around his waist|left]]
As a safeguard against escape, prisoners are routinely placed in [[physical restraint]]s for transport. The type of restraints used depends on the security level of the prisoners and may vary from department to department.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.asca.net/system/assets/attachments/3891/Inmate%20Transport%20Survey.pdf|title=ASCA Responses: Inmate Transport Surve|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a rule, most prisoners will have to wear at least [[handcuff]]s as a minimum restraint. Often, a [[belly chain (restraint)|belly chain]] is added so that the prisoner's hands are shackled to the waist.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.policemag.com/channel/patrol/articles/2013/05/safe-prisoner-transport.aspx|title=Safe Prisoner Transport|access-date=2017-01-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; Leather or nylon belts may be used instead of belly chains. To prevent the prisoner from manipulating the keyhole of the handcuffs, for instance if he or she gets hold of a handcuff key or a lockpick, a [[handcuff cover]] may be placed around the handcuffs. The additional precaution of [[Fetters|leg irons]] may also be taken, particularly if the prisoner will be walking outside of a secure area. When a prisoner is shackled at his or her hands, legs and around his or her waist, this is commonly known as being placed in "full restraints".[[File:Prisoner in transport restraints.jpg|thumb|Prisoner in transport restraints]]Specific prisoner transport restraints (e.g. [[Smith &amp; Wesson]] model 1850 ''transport restraint'')&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://blog.handcuffwarehouse.com/2010/04/25/smith-wesson-1850-in-use-on-former-us-congressman/|title=Smith &amp; Wesson 1850 in Use on Former US Congressman – Handcuff Warehouse Blog|access-date=2017-01-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; are combinations which consist of a pair of [[handcuffs]], attached by a longer chain to a pair of leg irons. When being placed in such transport restraints, the prisoner will still have the possibility to manage normal steps, but is prevented from running by the leg irons. The connecting chain also prevents the prisoner from lifting his or her arms. For transporting prisoners by car, special combinations called ''auto restraint'' are used where the chains of the leg irons as well as the connecting chains are shortened, allowing the prisoner only a stooping shuffling walk when he or she is outside the car.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.alexhandcuffs.com/inuse3.htm|title=New Page 1|website=www.alexhandcuffs.com|access-date=2017-01-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to restraints, a [[Stun belt]] may be fastened around the prisoner's waist for further control. In the event of the prisoner attempting to escape or attack someone, the escorting officers can activate the belt via a remote control to give the subject an electric shock.

=== Clothing ===
When going on a transport, prisoners will in most cases have to wear a [[Prison uniform]] to make them instantly identifiable. Sometimes, special high-visibility jackets are added for enhanced security.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.alexhandcuffs.com/inuse.htm|title=PHOTOGRAPH GALLERY ILLUSTRATING ITEMS IN USE|website=www.alexhandcuffs.com|access-date=2017-01-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Reconciliation of European Histories Group''' is an informal all-party group in the [[European Parliament]] involved in promoting the [[Prague Declaration on European Conscience and Communism|Prague Process]] in all of Europe, aimed at coming to terms with the [[totalitarian]] past in many countries of Europe. The group is chaired by former [[European Commissioner]] [[Sandra Kalniete]] and comprises members of the [[European People's Party (European Parliament group)|European People's Party]], the [[Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe|Alliance of Liberals and Democrats]], [[The Greens–European Free Alliance]], the [[Progressive Alliance of Socialists and Democrats]], [[Europe of Freedom and Democracy]], and the [[European Conservatives and Reformists]].&lt;ref name="REH"&gt;{{cite web|title= About Us – Reconciliation of European Histories Group|url=http://eureconciliation.wordpress.com/about/|publisher=Reconciliation of European Histories Group|accessdate=1 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; As of 2011, the group had 40 members, including Sandra Kalniete, [[Hans-Gert Pöttering]] (Chairman of the [[Konrad Adenauer Foundation]] and former [[President of the European Parliament]]), [[László Tőkés]] ([[Vice President of the European Parliament]]), [[Heidi Hautala]] (former Chair of the [[Subcommittee on Human Rights]]), and [[Gunnar Hökmark]] (Chairman of the [[European Friends of Israel]]). The group has co-hosted a number of public hearings and other meetings in the European Parliament on [[totalitarianism]] and [[communist crimes]] in Eastern and Central Europe. The Reconciliation of European Histories Group also cooperates closely with the Working Group on the [[Platform of European Memory and Conscience]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.memoryandconscience.eu/2011/08/17/new-webpage-test/ |title= Platform of European Memory and Conscience – a brief history |language= |publisher=[[Platform of European Memory and Conscience]] |date=2011-10-20 |accessdate=2011-10-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8405">'''Robin Grove-White''' (born [[Dublin]], 1941) is an [[Anglo-Irish]] Welsh environmentalist, and academic, Emeritus Professor of Environment and Society at [[Lancaster University]].  Grove-White Chairs the board of the Institute for Study of Welsh Estates (ISWE) at [[Bangor University]]. He is also involved in local organisations such as Menter Mechell, Cymdeithas Hanes Mechell and is vice chair of the Anglesey Antiquarian Society.  In 2018 he was awarded an honorary fellowship for Services to the Community at [[Bangor University]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bangor.ac.uk/graduation/news/bangor-university-announces-new-honorary-fellows-37111|title=Bangor University announces new Honorary Fellows|}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

==Background==
Grove-White was born in [[Dublin]] and raised on Anglesey, Wales, the son of William Grove-White, descended from the Bulkeley family of landowners and residing at Brynddu (rebuilt 1690) near [[Llanfechell]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cymdeithashanesmechell.co.uk/diaries.html|title=Brynddu and the Diaries|website=www.cymdeithashanesmechell.co.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt; From 1963-1968 he became a freelance scriptwriter, for the television series TW3 ([[That Was the Week that Was]]), a satirical programme hosted by [[David Frost]] and featuring [[Ned Sherrin]], [[Willie Rushton]] and [[Lance Percival]]. Other work was in TV, radio, cabaret, film, and advertising in UK, US and Canada (including 'The Establishment' (London), 'The Frost programme' (ITV), 'Marty' (ITV), 'This Hour Has Seven Days' (CBCTV), 'Second City' (Chicago), and McCann-Erickson (Toronto &amp; London).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.dailypost.co.uk/news/local-news/robin-grove-white-lives-wild-life-2849795|title=Robin Grove-White lives the wild life|first=North Wales Daily|last=Post|date=17 January 2008|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was formerly married to the writer [[Virginia Ironside]] but remarried.&lt;ref name="Ironside"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Jones|first1=Nigel|title=Why I hate book clubs (except the Daily's Mail's one, of course!)|url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/home/books/article-498309/Why-I-hate-book-clubs-Dailys-Mails-course.html|website=Daily Mail|accessdate=24 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In his late 20s he returned to complete his degree at the [[University of Oxford]] in politics, economics and philosophy (Worcester College, 1971). This led him into rural protection and environmental campaigning with the [[Campaign for the Protection of Rural England]] (1972-1981, then Director, 1981-1987). He was Chair of the Board of [[Greenpeace UK]] until 2004.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://csec.lancs.ac.uk/people/grove-white.htm|title=CSEC, Lancaster University - Robin Grove-White|website=csec.lancs.ac.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After a short spell at [[Imperial College]] he moved to [[Lancaster University]] in 1989 as a research fellow, eventually becoming Professor of Environment and Society. He established the Centre for the Study of Environmental Change (CSEC) in 1991, to focus on problems of contemporary environmental knowledge and policy development. The Centre now resides in the Sociology Department but it was highly active in environmental research, achieving a 5* research rating in the 1990s, with funding from the [[Economic and Social Research Council]] (ESRC), the [[Health and Safety Executive]], and the [[European Environment Agency]]. Other important members and collaborators included Prof. [[Brian Wynne]], Prof. [[Elizabeth Shove]], Simon Shackley, Prof. Bron Szerszynski, Claire Waterton and Prof. Phil Macnaghten.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.lancaster.ac.uk/fass/centres/csec/docs/wising_upmacnaghten.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; He was a member of the Government’s Agriculture and Environment Biotechnology Commission.

Grove-White retired in 2006 and moved back to the family farm in [[Llanfechell]], Anglesey, initiating several environmental improvements. He completed a PhD in History at [[Bangor University]] (''[http://e.bangor.ac.uk/5086/1/THESIS%2C%20final%20corrected%2C%20October%202012.pdf Welsh, English - or British? Hugh Hughes and late sixteenth-century Anglesey]'') in 2011 and served as High Sheriff of Anglesey and Gwynedd in 2011-12.&lt;ref name="Crimebeat North Wales"&gt;{{cite web|title=High Sheriff calls for support following round-Anglesey walk|url=http://www.crimebeatnorthwales.co.uk/high-sheriff-renews-call-for-support-following-round-anglesey-walk/|website=Crimebeat North Wales|accessdate=24 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Llanfechell he helped initiate the community hub venture, Caffi Siop Mechell.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.angleseyartsforum.org/en/aaw/member/caffi-siop-mechell|title=Caffi Siop Mechell}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Contributions==
Grove-White's career is dedicated to the challenge of a viable future in the face of environmental and technological change.  As an academic he strove to develop social science-based approaches to 'environmental' research, using 'sociology of knowledge' frameworks linking university centres with wider society. His main contributions there were to the public understanding of science, attitudes towards genetic engineering, local economic development, and spirituality and nature.  He continues to agitate.

The '''Soviet–Polish Non-Aggression Pact''' ({{lang-pl|Polsko-radziecki pakt o nieagresji}}, {{lang-ru|Pakt o nenapadenii mezhdu SSSR i Pol’shey}}) was an [[international law|international treaty]] of [[Non-aggression pact|non-aggression]] signed in 1932 by representatives of [[Poland]] and the [[USSR]]. The pact was unilaterally broken by the Soviet Union on September 17, 1939, during the [[Invasion of Poland|German and Soviet invasion of Poland]].

==Background==
After the [[Polish–Soviet War]], the Polish authorities pursued a policy of "equal distance" between Germany and the Soviet Union. Most of Polish politicians, both on the left and right, believed that Poland should rely mostly on the [[Franco-Polish Military Alliance|crucial alliance with France]] dating back to [[World War I]] and should not support either Germany or the Soviet Union. 

To normalize the bilateral contacts with the Soviet Union, talks were started in January 1926 to prepare a non-aggression treaty. The treaty was to fortify the Polish gains of the [[Peace of Riga]] and was to be balanced by a similar pact signed with Germany. However, the talks with Germany were not started, and the Polish–Soviet talks were interrupted in June 1927, after [[Great Britain]] broke diplomatic relations with the USSR and Soviet plenipotentiary [[Pyotr Voykov]] was murdered in [[Warsaw]]. Instead, Poland applied to the [[Briand-Kellogg Pact]] of 1928. The Polish-Soviet negotiations were resumed in Moscow, in 1931. The pact was finally signed on July 25, 1932, effective for a three-year period. Ratifications were exchanged in Warsaw on December 23, 1932, and it went into effect on the same day. It was registered in League of Nations Treaty Series on January 9, 1933.&lt;ref&gt;''League of Nations Treaty Series'', [http://www.worldlii.org/int/other/treaties/LNTSer/1933/7.html vol. 136, pp. 42-53.]&lt;/ref&gt; On May 5, 1934 it was extended to December 31, 1945 without amendment. Among other topics, both sides agreed to renounce violence in bilateral relations, to resolve their problems through negotiations and to forgo any armed conflict or alliances aimed at the other side. 

On September 23, 1938, the Soviet Union sent a note to the Polish government informing it that the pact will be considered null and void in the case of Poland's participation in the [[occupation of Czechoslovakia]] [http://www.pereplet.ru/history/suvorov/suv_polsh.htm]. However, this threat was not carried out, as the Soviet government stated on October 31, after Poland occupied [[Zaolzie]] area, that the pact remained in force [http://www.pereplet.ru/history/suvorov/suv_polsh.htm]. and it was reaffirmed by the two powers on November 26, 1938 (see [http://www.indiana.edu/~league/1938.htm]).  Finally the pact was broken by the Soviets on September 17, 1939, when the [[Red Army]] joined [[Nazi Germany]]'s forces in their invasion of Poland, in accordance with the secret protocols of the [[Molotov–Ribbentrop Pact]].

The pact was considered at the time as a major success of the Polish diplomacy, much weakened by the [[toll war]] with Germany, renouncement of parts of the [[Treaty of Versailles]] and loosened links with France. It also reinforced the Polish negotiating position with Germany, which resulted in signing of the [[German–Polish Non-Aggression Pact]] eighteen months later.

==History==
{{expand section|date=September 2012}}

Ukrainian border guards are the national successors of the [[USSR Border Troops|Soviet Border Troops]]. They were formed from the approximately 17,000 Border Troops located in Ukraine. In 1991, the organisation was first titled the "Ukrainian Border Troops", which was later subordinated to the "Ukraine's State Committee for State Border Guarding".

From 1991 to at least 1993, the new borders with [[Russia]] and [[Belarus]] were not guarded; the Border Troops were only deployed along the western borders (minus [[Moldova]]) and on the [[Black Sea]].&lt;ref&gt;Leonid Polyakov, 'Paramilitary Structures in Ukraine,' Almanac on Security Sector Governance in Ukraine 2010, 143-144, [[Geneva Centre for the Democratic Control of Armed Forces]].&lt;/ref&gt; Another 9,000 personnel were added to the Border Troops at the expense of the [[Armed Forces of Ukraine]], and, by the end of 1993, border posts were established in the north along the Russian and Belarusian borders. In 1999, the authorised strength of the force was again increased to 50,000.

In 2003, new legislation was adopted, and this somewhat changed the legal status of the institution. In March 2003, the Border Troops became the State Border Guard Service of Ukraine, and its status was legally changed from 'military formation' to 'special law-enforcement body.' The force was legally granted 50,000 personnel, including 8,000 civilian employees.

On 4 July 2012, a State Border Guard Service [[Diamond DA42]] aircraft failed to make its scheduled radio contact with ground units. A [[Search and rescue]] mission revealed that the plane had crashed into a wooded mountainous area in [[Velykyi Bereznyi Raion]], killing all 3 crew members on board. A further investigation was launched.&lt;ref&gt;[http://ua-reporter.com/novosti/119031 Фотографии с места катастрофы самолета Diamond DA-42 в Закарпатье]&lt;/ref&gt;

During The [[War in Donbass]] on August 31, 2014 two Sea Guard Zhuk class patrol boats where struck by land based artillery.

{{Refimprove|date=December 2007}}

'''''Trading Up: Consumer and Environmental Regulation in a Global Economy''''' ([[Harvard University Press]] 1995, {{ISBN|0-674-90084-7}}) is a book by [[UC Berkeley]] political scientist and business professor, [[David Vogel (professor)|David Vogel]].  It examines the impact of [[free trade]] on [[Environmental policy|environmental]] regulations.  It analyzes the [[General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade]] (GATT), [[North American Free Trade Agreement]] (NAFTA), the [[Canada-United States Free Trade Agreement]], and the treaties that created the [[European Community]] and [[European Union|Union]], and looks at cases including the GATT tuna-dolphin dispute, the EC's beef hormone ban, the Danish bottle case.  

Some environmentalists have expressed concern that [[trade liberalization]] and acceptance of trade rules (with, for example, the [[World Trade Organization]]) will retard and even undermine national regulations for [[consumer protection]] and environmental improvement, as in the tuna-dolphin case. These observers are also concerned about competition among nations for footloose industries. This interesting book systematically examines the original European Community, the Single European Act, the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade and its 1979 standards code, the U.S.-Canada Free Trade Area, and the more recent North American Free Trade Agreement, as well as the states in the free trade area of the United States. Vogel finds that, while counterexamples do exist, trade liberalization on balance has strongly reinforced environment-improving regulations. A good example is auto emissions requirements, which have gradually stiffened and leveled up in the trading system over time. Three reasons are adduced, mainly concerning the major markets. First, stiffer regulations sometimes enhance the competitive advantage of firms, thus lining up industrialists with environmentalists in an open economy. Second, these markets (California in the United States, Germany in Europe, the United States and EU in the world at large) can set product standards that outsiders have to meet. Third, to the extent they are governed by environmentally sensitive parties (mainly the United States and EU), the major economies have negotiated international agreements that foster environmental improvement.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/51443/richard-n-cooper/trading-up-consumer-and-environmental-regulation-in-a-global-eco&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Traffic police''' or '''traffic officers''',&lt;ref&gt;[[United States Department of Transportation]], [[National Highway Traffic Safety Administration]], National Committee on Uniform Traffic Laws and Ordinances, ''Traffic Laws Annotated 1979'' (1981), p. 17.&lt;/ref&gt; often referred to colloquially as '''traffic cops''', are [[police officer]]s who direct [[traffic]] or serve in a traffic or roads policing unit enforcing [[Traffic#Rules of the road|rules of the road]]. Traffic police include [[highway patrol|officers who patrol major roads]] and also police who address traffic infractions on other roads. It has been noted that:

{{quotation|...traffic police, who are regarded as peripheral to most police forces, participate in both authoritative intervention and symbolic justice. Perhaps alone of all the assignments, traffic police are full-service police. They are different from the rest, however, because their work is limited to a particular venue — namely, public thoroughfares — and to particular people — namely, those who operate motor vehicles. But in terms of work, traffic police are detectives as well as patrol officers.&lt;ref&gt;David H. Bayley, ''Police for the Future'' (1996), p. 34.&lt;/ref&gt;}}
[[File:Police traffic enforcement equipment.jpg|thumb|Typical traffic enforcement tools in the United States]]

==History==
Traffic police have existed in some form for nearly three centuries:

{{quotation|Road traffic began to increase in volume and speed during the eighteenth century, and the above mix of practices led to a clear need for some legal rule-making. In response, in 1722 the [[lord mayor of London]] appointed three men to ensure that traffic kept to the left and did not stop on [[London Bridge]]. They were possibly the world's first traffic police.&lt;ref&gt;M. G. Lay, ''Ways of the World: A History of the World's Roads and of the Vehicles That Used Them'' (1992), p. 199.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

==Automatic traffic police==
{{Details|Traffic Robots in Kinshasa}}
In the [[Democratic Republic of the Congo]] five automatic traffic police are in operation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title=Robocops being used as traffic police in Democratic Republic of Congo|work=Guardian|url=https://www.theguardian.com/travel/2015/mar/05/robocops-being-used-as-traffic-police-in-democratic-republic-of-congo|date=5 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The large aluminium figures are able to rotate at the waist, and contain [[closed circuit television]] cameras to allow them to record offenders, for later apprehension or imposition of fines.  The system runs on solar power, from panels on the roof of the structure within which the robot stands.  The robot controls the traffic with red and green lights in its hands, and the use of articulated arms.  The robots can also speak to pedestrians and help them safely cross the road.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|work=Irish Examiner|title=Robot traffic wardens patrol Democratic Republic of Congo|url=http://www.irishexaminer.com/world/robot-traffic-wardens-patrol-democratic-republic-of-congo-316331.html|date=6 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The system is designed and built by a women's engineering co-operative in DRC.  Another five robots have been bought for [[Katanga Province|Katanga]] province, and a further thirty for motorway use have been proposed.

{{For|the Whig philosophy of history|Whig history}}
'''Whiggism''' (in North America sometimes spelled '''Whigism''') is a historical [[political philosophy]] that grew out of the [[Roundhead|Parliamentarian]] faction in the [[Wars of the Three Kingdoms]] (1639–1651). The Whigs' key policy positions were the supremacy of Parliament (as opposed to that of the king), tolerance of [[Protestant]] [[dissenter]]s and opposition to a "[[Papist]]" ([[Roman Catholic]]) on the throne, especially [[James II of England|James II]] or one of his descendants.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |last=Hamowy|first=Ronald|authorlink=Ronald Hamowy |encyclopedia=The Encyclopedia of Libertarianism |title=Whiggism |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=yxNgXs3TkJYC |year=2008 |publisher=[[SAGE Publications|SAGE]]; [[Cato Institute]] |location=Thousand Oaks, CA |isbn=978-1-4129-6580-4 |oclc=750831024 |lccn=2008009151 |pages=542–43 |doi=10.4135/9781412965811.n328 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

After the huge success (from the Whig point of view) of the [[Glorious Revolution]] of 1688–1689, Whiggism dominated [[Kingdom of England|English]] and [[Kingdom of Great Britain|British]] politics until about 1760, although in practice the political group splintered into different factions. After 1760, the Whigs lost power – apart from sharing it in some short-lived [[coalition government]]s – but Whiggism fashioned itself into a generalised belief system that emphasised innovation and liberty and was strongly held by about half of the leading families in England and Scotland, as well as most merchants, dissenters and the middle classes. The opposing [[Tory]] position was held by the other great families, the [[Church of England]], most of the [[landed gentry]] and officers of the [[British Army|army]] and the [[Royal Navy|navy]]. Whiggism originally referred to the [[Whig (British political party)|Whigs]] of the [[British Isles]], but the name of "Old Whigs" was largely adopted by the American [[Patriot (American Revolution)|Patriots]] in the [[Thirteen Colonies]]. Following independence, American Whiggism became known as [[Republicanism in the United States|republicanism]]. The term "Old Whigs" was also used in Britain for those Whigs who opposed [[Robert Walpole]] as part of the [[Country Party (Britain)|Country Party]].

One meaning of whiggism given by the ''[[Oxford English Dictionary]]'' is "moderate or antiquated Liberalism".&lt;ref&gt;''[http://www.oed.com/view/Entry/228332?redirectedFrom=whiggism#eid Whiggism, n.]'' at oed.com. Retrieved 16 August 2011 (subscription required)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Coining of "whiggism"==
Quickly following the adoption of "whig" as the name of a political faction, the word "whiggism" was already in use by the 1680s. In 1682, [[Edmund Hickeringill]] published his ''History of Whiggism''.&lt;ref name=hickeringill&gt;[[Edmund Hickeringill]], ''The history of Whiggism: or, The Whiggish-plots, principles, and practices, (mining and countermining the Tory-plots and principles) in the reign of King Charles the first, during the conduct of affaires, under the influence of the three great minions and favourites, Buckingham, Laud, and Strafford; and the sad forre-runners and prologues to that fatal-year (to England and Ireland) 41: Where in (as in a mirrour) is shown the face of the late (we do not say the present) times'' [In two parts] (London: Printed for E. Smith, at the Elephant and Castle in Cornhill, 1682)&lt;/ref&gt; In 1702, writing satirically in the guise of a [[Tory]], [[Daniel Defoe]] asserted: "We can never enjoy a settled uninterrupted Union and Tranquility in this Nation, till the Spirit of Whiggisme, Faction, and Schism is melted down like the Old-Money".&lt;ref&gt;Daniel Defoe, ''The shortest way with the Dissenters: or Proposals for the establishment of the Church'' (1702), p. 15&lt;/ref&gt; The name probably originates from a shortening of Whiggamore referring to the [[Whiggamore Raid]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=whig {{!}} Origin and meaning of the name whig by Online Etymology Dictionary|url=https://www.etymonline.com/word/whig|website=www.etymonline.com|accessdate=13 February 2018|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Origins==
The true origins of what became known as whiggism lie in the [[Wars of the Three Kingdoms]] and the power struggle between the [[Parliament of England]] and [[Charles I of England|King Charles I]], which eventually turned into the [[English Civil War]]s, but only after the example of the successful use of violent opposition to the king set by the [[Bishops' Wars]], which were fought between the same king in his capacity as king of [[Scotland]] on the one side and the [[Parliament of Scotland]] and the [[Church of Scotland]] on the other. However, the immediate origins of the Whigs and whiggism were in the [[Exclusion Bill]] crisis of 1678 to 1681, in which a "country party" battled a "court party" in an unsuccessful attempt to exclude [[James II of England|James, Duke of York]], from succeeding his brother [[Charles II of England|Charles II]] as king of [[Kingdom of England|England]], [[Kingdom of Scotland|Scotland]] and [[Kingdom of Ireland|Ireland]]. This crisis was prompted by Charles's lack of a legitimate heir, by the discovery in 1673 that James was a [[Roman Catholic]], and by the so-called "[[Popish Plot]]" of 1678.&lt;ref&gt;Odai Johnson, ''Rehearsing the revolution'' (2000), p. 14&lt;/ref&gt;

While a major principle of whiggism was opposition to [[popery]], that was always much more than a mere religious preference in favour of [[Protestantism]], although most Whigs did have such a preference. [[Henry Capel|Sir Henry Capel]] outlined the principal motivation of the cry of "no popery" when he said in the [[House of Commons of England|House of Commons]] on 27 April 1679:

{{quote|From Popery came the notion of a [[standing army]] and arbitrary Power... Formerly the Crown of Spain, and now France, supports this root of Popery amongst us; but lay Popery flat, and there's an end of arbitrary Government and power. It is a mere chimera, or notion, without Popery.&lt;ref&gt;John Kenyon, ''The Popish Plot'' (Phoenix Press, 2000), pp. 2–3&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Although they were unsuccessful in preventing the accession of the Duke of York to the throne, the Whigs in alliance with [[William III of England|William of Orange]] brought him down in the [[Glorious Revolution]] of 1688. By that event, a new supremacy of parliament was established, which itself was one of the principles of whiggism, much as it had been the chief principle of the [[Roundheads]] in an earlier generation.&lt;ref&gt;Melinda S. Zook, ''Radical Whigs and conspiratorial politics in late Stuart England'' (1999), p. xiv&lt;/ref&gt;

The great Whiggish achievement was the [[Bill of Rights 1689|Bill of Rights of 1689]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Maurice Adams|author2=Anne Meuwese|author3=Ernst Hirsch Ballin|title=Constitutionalism and the Rule of Law: Bridging Idealism and Realism|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=-oY7DgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA97|year=2017|publisher=Cambridge UP|page=97}}&lt;/ref&gt; It made Parliament, not the Crown, supreme.  It established free elections to the Commons (although they were mostly controlled by the local landlord) free speech in parliamentary debates, and gave all Britons freedom from ‘cruel or unusual punishment’.&lt;ref&gt;
Robert Blackburn, [http://www.bl.uk/magna-carta/articles/britains-unwritten-constitution "Britain's unwritten constitution" ''British Library'' (2015)]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Variations==
[[File:Algernon Sidney 1622-1683 Discourses 1698.jpg|thumb|Title page of Sidney's ''Discourses Concerning Government'' (1698)]]
Lee Ward (2008) argues that the philosophical origins of Whiggism came in [[James Tyrrell (writer)|James Tyrrell]]'s ''Patriarcha Non Monarcha'' (1681), [[John Locke]]'s ''[[Two Treatises of Government]]'' (1689) and [[Algernon Sidney]]'s ''Discourses Concerning Government'' (1698).&lt;ref&gt;Lee Ward, ''The Politics of Liberty in England and Revolutionary America'' (Cambridge University Press, 2004)&lt;/ref&gt; All three were united in opposing [[Robert Filmer|Sir Robert Filmer]]'s defence of [[Divine right of kings|divine right]] and [[absolute monarchy]]. Tyrrell propounded a moderate Whiggism which interpreted England's balanced and mixed constitution "as the product of a contextualized social compact blending elements of custom, history, and prescription with inherent natural law obligations".&lt;ref&gt;Ward, p. 14&lt;/ref&gt; However, Sidney emphasised the main themes of [[republicanism]] and based Whig ideology in the sovereignty of the people by proposing a constitutional reordering that would both elevate the authority of Parliament and democratise its forms. Sidney also emphasised classical republican notions of virtue.&lt;ref&gt;Ward, ch. 6&lt;/ref&gt; Ward says that Locke's liberal Whiggism rested on a radically individualist theory of natural rights and limited government.&lt;ref&gt;Ward, ch. 8–9&lt;/ref&gt; Tyrrell's moderate position came to dominate Whiggism and British constitutionalism as a whole from 1688 to the 1770s.&lt;ref&gt;Ward, ch. 11&lt;/ref&gt; The more radical ideas of Sidney and Locke, argues Ward, became marginalised in Britain, but emerged as a dominant strand in American republicanism. The issues raised by the Americans, starting with the [[Stamp Act 1765|Stamp Act]] crisis of 1765, ripped Whiggism apart in a battle of parliamentary sovereignty (Tyrrell) versus popular sovereignty (Sidney and Locke).&lt;ref&gt;Ward, pp. 327–50&lt;/ref&gt;

==Across the British Empire==
Whiggism took different forms in England and Scotland, even though from 1707 the two nations shared a [[Parliament of Great Britain|single parliament]].&lt;ref name=hearn&gt;Jonathan Hearn, ''Claiming Scotland: national identity and liberal culture'' (2000), p. 138&lt;/ref&gt; While English whiggism had at its heart the power of parliament, creating for that purpose a [[constitutional monarchy]] and a permanently [[Succession to the British throne|Protestant succession to the throne]], Scottish Whigs gave a higher priority to using power for religious purposes, including maintaining the authority of the [[Church of Scotland]], justifying the [[Protestant Reformation]] and emulating the [[Covenanters]].&lt;ref name=hearn/&gt;

There were also Whigs in the North American colonies and while whiggism there had much in common with that in [[Kingdom of Great Britain|Great Britain]], it too had its own priorities. In the unfolding of the [[American Revolution]] such whiggism became known as [[Republicanism in the United States|republicanism]].&lt;ref&gt;George Herbert Guttridge, ''English whiggism and the American revolution'' (1974), pp. 10, 68&lt;/ref&gt;

In India, Prashad (1966) argues that the profound influence of the ideas of [[Edmund Burke]] introduced Whiggism into the mainstream of Indian political thought. The Indians adopted the basic assumptions of Whiggism, especially the natural leadership of an elite, the political incapacity of the masses, the great partnership of the civil society and the best methods of achieving social progress, analysing the nature of society and the nation and depicting the character of the ideal state.&lt;ref&gt;Ganesh Prashad, "Whiggism in India," ''Political Science Quarterly'' Vol. 81, No. 3 (Sep. 1966), pp. 412–31 [https://www.jstor.org/stable/2147642 in JSTOR]&lt;/ref&gt;

{{more citations needed|date=July 2015}}
The '''working class''' (or '''labouring class''') comprises the people employed for [[wage]]s, especially in [[manual labour|manual-labour]] occupations and industrial work.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=working class |url=http://www.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/english/working-class |work=Oxford Dictionaries |access-date=8 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Working-class occupations (see also "[[Designation of workers by collar color]]") include [[Blue-collar worker|blue-collar]] jobs, some [[White-collar worker|white-collar]] jobs, and most [[Pink-collar worker|pink-collar]] jobs. The working class only rely upon their earnings from [[wage labour]], thereby, the category includes most of the working population of [[developed country|industrialized economies]], of the [[urban area]]s (cities, towns, villages) of [[developing country|non-industrialized economies]], and of the rural workforce.

In [[Marxist theory]] and [[socialism|socialist]] literature, the term ''working class'' is often used interchangeably with the term ''[[proletariat]]'' and includes all workers who expend both physical and mental labour (salaried [[knowledge worker]]s and [[white-collar worker]]s) to produce [[Value (economics)|economic value]] for the owners of the [[means of production]] (the [[bourgeoisie]] in [[Marxism|Marxist]] literature).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Glaberman |first=Martin |author-link=Martin Glaberman |year=1975 |title=Marxist Views of the Working Class |url=https://www.marxists.org/archive/glaberman/1974/09/wclass.htm |work=The Working Class and Social Change |access-date=18 January 2013 |via=Marxists Internet Archive}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Definitions==

As with many terms describing [[social class]], ''working class'' is defined and used in many different ways.  The most general definition, used by [[Marxism|Marxists]] and many [[socialism|socialists]], is that the working class includes all those who have nothing to sell but their labour power and skills.  In that sense it includes both white and blue-collar workers, manual and mental workers of all types, excluding only individuals who derive their income from business ownership and the labour of others.{{sfn|McKibbin|2000|p=164}}{{verification needed|date=November 2018}}

When used non-academically in the United States, however, it often refers to a section of society dependent on physical [[labour economics|labour]], especially when compensated with an hourly [[wage]]. For certain types of science, as well as less scientific or journalistic political analysis, for example, the working class is loosely defined as those without college degrees.&lt;ref name="NYTCanary"&gt;{{cite news |last=Edsall |first=Thomas B. |author-link=Thomas B.

A common alternative, {{citation needed span |date=November 2018 |text=sometimes used in [[sociology]],}} is to define class by income levels.{{sfn|Linkon|1999|p=4}} When this approach is used, the working class can be contrasted with a so-called ''[[middle class]] ''on the basis of differential terms of access to economic resources, [[education]], cultural interests, and other goods and services. The cut-off between working class and middle class here might mean the line where a population has discretionary income, rather than simply  sustenance (for example, on [[fashion]] versus merely [[nutrition]] and shelter).

Some researchers have suggested that working-class status should be defined subjectively as self-identification with the working-class group.{{sfn|Rubin|Denson|Kilpatrick|Matthews|2014}}{{page needed|date=November 2018}} This subjective approach allows people, rather than researchers, to define their own social class.

==History and growth==
[[File:Victorian Bishopgate.jpg|thumb|Working-class life in [[Victorian era|Victorian]] [[Wetherby]], [[West Riding of Yorkshire]], England]]

In [[feudalism|feudal]] Europe, the working class as such did not exist in large numbers. Instead, most people were part of the labouring class, a group made up of different professions, trades and occupations. A lawyer, craftsman and peasant were all considered to be part of the same [[social unit]], a [[Estates of the realm|third estate]] of people who were neither [[Aristocracy (class)|aristocrats]] nor church officials. Similar hierarchies existed outside Europe in other [[pre-industrial societies]]. The social position of these labouring classes was viewed as ordained by [[natural law]] and common religious belief. This social position was contested, particularly by peasants, for example during the [[German Peasants' War]].{{sfn|Abendroth|1973}}{{page needed|date=November 2018}}

In the late 18th century, under the influence of the [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]], European society was in a state of change, and this change could not be reconciled with the idea of a changeless god-created social order. Wealthy members of these societies created ideologies which blamed many of the problems of working-class people on their morals and ethics (i.e. excessive consumption of alcohol, perceived laziness and inability to save money). In ''[[The Making of the English Working Class]]'', [[E.&amp;nbsp;P. Thompson]] argues that the English working class was present at its own creation, and seeks to describe the transformation of pre-modern labouring classes into a modern, politically self-conscious, working class.{{sfn|Abendroth|1973}}{{verification needed|date=November 2018}}

Starting around 1917, a number of countries became ruled ostensibly in the interests of the working class (see [[Soviet working class]]). Some historians have noted that a key change in these Soviet-style societies has been a massive a new type of [[proletarianization]], often effected by the administratively achieved forced displacement of peasants and rural workers. Since then, four major industrial states have turned towards semi-market-based governance ([[China]], [[Laos]], [[Vietnam]], [[Cuba]]), and one state has turned inwards into an increasing cycle of poverty and brutalization ([[North Korea]]). Other states of this sort have either collapsed (such as the [[Soviet Union]]), or never achieved significant levels of industrialization or large working classes.{{sfn|Kuromiya|1990|p=87}}

Since 1960, large-scale proletarianization and [[enclosure]] of commons has occurred in the [[third world]], generating new working classes. Additionally, countries such as [[India]] have been slowly undergoing social change, expanding the size of the urban working class.{{sfn|Gutkind|1988}}{{page needed|date=November 2018}}

==Marxist definition: the proletariat==
{{main|Proletariat}}
[[File:battle strike 1934.jpg|thumb|Striking teamsters battling police on the streets of [[Minneapolis]], [[Minnesota]], June 1934]]
[[Karl Marx]] defined the working class or [[proletariat]] as individuals who sell their [[labour power]] for [[wage]]s and who do not own the [[means of production]]. He argued that they were responsible for creating the [[wealth]] of a society.  He asserted that the working class physically build bridges, craft furniture, grow food, and nurse children, but do not own land, or [[factories]].{{sfn|Lebowitz|2016}}{{page needed|date=November 2018}}

A sub-section of the proletariat, the [[lumpenproletariat]] (''rag-proletariat''), are the extremely poor and unemployed, such as [[day labourer]]s and [[homeless]] people. Marx considered them to be devoid of class consciousness.

In ''[[The Communist Manifesto]]'', Karl Marx and [[Friedrich Engels]] argued that it was the destiny of the working class to displace the [[capitalism|capitalist]] system, with the [[dictatorship of the proletariat]], abolishing the social relationships underpinning the class system and then developing into a future [[communist]] society in which "the free development of each is the condition for the free development of all." Some issues in Marxist arguments about working-class membership have included:
*The class status of people in a temporary or permanent position of [[unemployment]].
*The class status of [[domestic labour]], particularly the children (see [[child labour]]), and also traditionally the wives of male workers, as some spouses do not themselves work in paying jobs outside the home.
*Whether workers can be considered working class if they own [[personal property]] or small amounts of stock ownership.
*The relationships among peasants, rural smallholders, and the working class.
*The extent to which non-class group identities and politics (race, gender, et al.) can obviate or substitute for working-class membership in Enlightenment projects, where working-class membership is prohibitively contradictory or obfuscated.

Possible responses to some of these issues are:
*Unemployed workers are proletariat.
*Class for dependents is determined by the primary income earner.
*Personal property is argued to be different from [[private property]]. For example, the proletariat can own automobiles; this is personal property.
*The self-employed worker may be a member of the ''[[petite bourgeoisie]]'' (for example, a small store owner who controls little capital), or a ''de facto'' member of the proletariat (for example, a contract worker whose income may be relatively high, but is precarious and tied to the need to sell one's labour on the labour market).

In general, in Marxist terms, [[wage slavery|wage labourers]] and those dependent on the [[welfare state]] are working class, and those who live on [[capital accumulation|accumulated capital]] are not. This broad dichotomy defines the [[class struggle]]. Different groups and individuals may at any given time be on one side or the other. For example, retired factory workers are working-class in the popular sense; but to the extent that they live off [[fixed income]]s, financed by stock in [[corporations]] whose earnings are [[Profit (economics)|profit]], retired factory workers' interests, and possibly their identities and politics, are not working class. Such contradictions of interests and identity within individuals' lives and within communities can effectively undermine the ability of the working class to act in solidarity to reduce [[Exploitation of labour|exploitation]], inequality, and the role of [[ownership]] in determining people's life chances, work conditions, and political power.
