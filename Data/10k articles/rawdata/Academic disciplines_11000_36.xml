[[File:Adonis Mazarin Louvre MR239.jpg|thumb|upright|Statue of the Roman deity ''Adonis'', who is revered as the primary deity in Adonism.]]
'''Adonism''' is a [[Modern paganism|Neopagan]] religion founded in 1925 by the German esotericist Franz Sättler (1884-c.1942), who often went by the pseudonym of Dr. Musalam. Although Sättler claimed that it was the continuation of an ancient pagan religion, it has been recognised by academics as being "instead the single-handed creation of a highly gifted and educated man", this figure being Sättler himself.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Ha10|Hakl 2010]]. p. 07.&lt;/ref&gt; Adonism is a [[polytheism|polytheistic]] religion, revolving around a belief that there are five principal gods: [[Bel (mythology)|Belus]], [[Bêlit|Biltis]], [[Adonis]], [[Dido]] and [[Moloch|Molchos]]. [[Adonis]] is the most prominent of these in the group's theology, being a benevolent figure that Sättler equated with the Christian figure of [[Satan]]. In contrast to Adonis, Molchos is believed by Adonists to be malevolent, and to be responsible for the enslavement of humanity through [[monotheism|monotheistic]] religions such as [[Judaism]], [[Christianity]] and [[Islam]]: the religion therefore has "a pronounced anti-Christian bias".&lt;ref&gt;[[#Ha10|Hakl 2010]]. p. 05, 16-17.&lt;/ref&gt;

Born into the [[Bohemia]]n region of the [[Austro-Hungarian Empire]], Franz Sättler proved himself to be a talented linguist, gaining a doctorate in the subject and publishing the world's first Persian-German dictionary. Subsequently travelling across much of Europe, he was imprisoned by the French during the [[First World War]], where he first came across [[Theosophy (Blavatskian)|Theosophy]] and the [[occult]], topics which greatly interested him. Briefly becoming an intelligence agent for the Czechoslovak government, he was again arrested and imprisoned, this time in Germany, and whilst imprisoned here he began formulating some of his esoteric ideas and writing books on the subject. Released in the mid-1920s, he went on to begin propagating Adonism through the foundation of his Adonistic Society. Sättler would face legal trouble and a public scandal due to his beliefs in the 1930s, leading to him renaming the Society the Alliance of Orion, before it was eventually shut down by the [[Nazi]] government in 1939. Sättler himself disappeared in the early years of the following decade, with some believing that he was executed by the Nazi authorities.

Scholar Hans Thomas Hakl stated that "The influence of Adonism... on the German magical scene is substantial. It definitely influenced the German magus [[Friedrich Wilhelm Quintscher]] (1893-1945)... and also the [[Fraternitas Saturni]], the most interesting occult fraternity in modern Germany".&lt;ref&gt;[[#Ha10|Hakl 2010]]. p. 08.&lt;/ref&gt; Many of the group's adherents have also claimed that Adonism was an influence on the German magician [[Franz Bardon]] (1909–1958), although this remains debatable as Bardon's magical beliefs differed to "a noticeable degree".&lt;ref&gt;[[#Ha10|Hakl 2010]]. p. 08.&lt;/ref&gt; Hakl would also compare Sättler with two of his contemporaries in the European occult movement of the early twentieth century, the Englishman [[Aleister Crowley]] and the Armenian [[George Gurdjieff]], but noted that he never received the posthumous fame that these two experienced.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Ha10|Hakl 2010]]. p. 19.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Beliefs and practices ==
Sättler erroneously claimed that Adonism was an ancient religion which had been followed by the [[Babylon|Chaldeans]], [[Phoenicians]], [[Persia]]ns, [[Ancient Egyptian|Egyptians]] and [[Ancient Greeks|Greeks]]. He also made the claim that it survived in part amongst the [[Yezidis]] of the Middle East, and also among the people of Nuristan (a fictional place he considered to be separate to the actual [[Nuristan]] in [[Afghanistan]]). It was in this latter city that he claimed that there was a large temple, the "Bit Nur" (House of Light), where he claimed the original ancient Adonist scriptures were kept. Other than Sättler’s claims however, there is no evidence that Nuristan or the Bit Nur have ever existed. Sättler claimed that it was in this temple that he first learned about Adonism, and where he was given the name of Dr Mussalam.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Ha10|Hakl 2010]]. p. 16.&lt;/ref&gt;

Adonism is a [[polytheism|polytheistic]] religion, believing in a number of different gods, of which there are five principal deities. Adonists believe that the first two of these were the primordial god [[Bel (mythology)|Belus]] and his consort [[Bêlit|Biltis]], and that they emerged from [[Chaos (cosmogony)|Chaos]]. According to Adonistic beliefs, Belus and Biltis had a child, [[Moloch|Molchos]], who was a malevolent deity and who created a world populated with deformed monsters; because of the horror of it, Belus and Biltis destroyed this world, before going on to give birth to two more children, a benevolent son named Adonis and a daughter called Dido. Adonis then created our world, basing humanity upon the likeness of both himself and his sister, however Molchos then killed Adonis out of jealousy, taking control of the world. Being resurrected by Dido, Adonis then went on to try to protect humanity from Molchos' machinations, for instance telling one human, a man called [[Noah]], to build a wooden ark to save him and the other animal species from the [[Great Flood]].&lt;ref&gt;[[#Ha10|Hakl 2010]]. p. 16.&lt;/ref&gt;

Molchos, however, was not finished in his attempts to harm humanity. Aside from attacking them with plagues and sickness, he also sent false prophets such as [[Moses]], [[Zarathustra]], [[Jesus]] and [[Muhammad]] to convert people to his [[monotheism|monotheistic]] worship under such names as [[Jehovah]], [[Ormuzd]] and [[Allah]]. Within these religions that venerate Molchos, such as [[Zoroastrianism]], [[Judaism]], [[Christianity]] and [[Islam]], Adonists believe that Adonis, the creator and benefactor of humanity was demonised as such figures as [[Satan]], [[Ahriman]] and [[Iblis]]. Through the domination of these monotheistic religions, Adonists believe that Molchos maintained control of the world, but that in 2000 CE, Adonis will face Molchos in a final battle, defeating him and bringing about a [[Golden Age]], which will last until the universe is once more subsumed under Chaos.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Ha10|Hakl 2010]]. p. 17.&lt;/ref&gt;

The primary way in which Adonis and Dido are celebrated in Adonistic religious practice is by the sensual enjoyment of [[sexual intercourse]], both of the [[heterosexual]] and [[homosexual]] varieties. Indeed, Sättler summarised his faith by remarking that "Adonism is worship of the Devil [i.e. Adonis] with an erotic background." He was therefore a prominent proponent of sexual reform in early nineteenth-century Germany, holding to beliefs that would later be legally accepted in the last decades of that century. Adonism also holds to a great belief in tolerance for other human beings, with Sättler stating that "The most important virtue of the Adonist is tolerance and the area in which he can practice it is boundless", and also holding to a personal maxim: "To understand everything means to pardon everything."&lt;ref&gt;[[#Ha10|Hakl 2010]]. p. 18-19.&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==

=== Sättler's early life: 1884-1925 ===
[[File:Musallam.jpg|thumb|right|A picture of the young Franz Sättler.]]
Sättler was born on 7 March 1884 as the son of a police constable in [[Most (Most District)|Most]], a city in northern [[Bohemia]], a Czech region which was then a part of the [[Austro-Hungarian Empire]]. There he attended elementary and then [[grammar school]], where he excelled in languages, learning [[Greek language|Greek]], [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]], [[Arabic language|Arabic]], [[Ancient Greek language|Ancient Greek]] and [[Latin]] by the time that he left. He had also begun writing for a local newspaper. He began attending the [[Charles University of Prague]], where he initially studied [[philology]], but becoming bored of this, switched to [[Oriental studies]]. At the university, he became a favourite student of Professor Max Grünert, who gave Sättler the notes for a [[Persian language|Persian]]-German  dictionary that had been left unfinished by Dr Jakob Polak. Sättler completed the task, producing the first ever dictionary between the two languages.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Ha10|Hakl 2010]]. p. 08-09.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1905 he travelled to [[Montenegro]] and [[Albania]], being paid to do so by the Austrian Institute of Military Geography, who employed him to check the accuracy of their maps. The following year, he travelled to [[Dresden]] in Germany, where he met his literary idol, [[Karl May]], whose German-language adventure novels had inspired him as a child. In the latter part of 1906 and much of 1907, he again went travelling, this time visiting Albania, [[Lebanon]] and [[Syria]] (which he used as inspiration for several novels that he would later write), and in 1908 he then travelled to the north of Europe, visiting [[Finland]].&lt;ref&gt;[[#Ha10|Hakl 2010]]. p. 09.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1909 he began studying for a [[doctorate]], earning it by writing a [[dissertation]] on the Arabian dialect of [[Hadramaut]], while in the same year marrying Anastasia Goldschmidt. Gaining employment at a private school for foreign languages in [[Prague]], he co-wrote two books on how to study the German language with the owner of the school. Using what he described as the "direct learning method", he attempted to teach people the language using the methods developed by [[Jan Amos Comenius]]. He then worked as a private tutor both in the house of Count Khevenhüller in [[Beirut]] and the consular school in [[Salonika]]. It was while he was here that the [[First World War]] broke out across Europe, and he began travelling across the [[Ottoman Empire]] (which was on the side of the Austro-Hungarian Empire).&lt;ref&gt;[[#Ha10|Hakl 2010]]. p. 09-10.&lt;/ref&gt;

The French army subsequently invaded and occupied Saloniki at a time when he was staying there, and being a citizen of the Austro-Hungarian Empire, he and his wife were taken prisoner and deported to an [[internment camp]] near [[Lourdes]] in France, where he was held until 1919. It was here that he befriended the camp's chief officer, M. Parizot, who was actively involved in the esoteric movement of [[Theosophy (Blavatskian)|Theosophy]]. Following their many discussions on the subject, Parizot transferred his library of occult books to the camp in order that Sättler could read them. These texts included the works of such figures as [[Helena Blavatsky]], [[Annie Besant]], [[Charles Leadbeater]], [[Camille Flammarion]] and [[Maurice Maeterlinck]], and these texts "formed the intellectual basis of his later occult career."&lt;ref&gt;[[#Ha10|Hakl 2010]]. p. 10.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1919, following the end of the war, Sättler was released from his imprisonment, and travelled to [[Austria]], and then on to Germany, where he was apparently involved in intelligence work on behalf of the newly formed nation-state of [[Czechoslovakia]], using the pseudonym of Dr. Erich Bauer. In 1922 he was captured by the German authorities and sentenced to a four-year imprisonment in [[Brandenburg an der Havel]]. Here, he was once more allowed the use of the prison library, writing several books, including ''Buch der orientalischen Geheimnisse'' (Book of Oriental Secrets) and ''Zauberbibel'' (Magical Bible), the latter of which was divided into seven sections, each of which looked at a different occult practice: [[cartomancy]], [[astrology]], the interpretation of dreams, [[chiromancy]], [[Magic (paranormal)|magic]], [[alchemy]] and [[necromancy]]. Meanwhile, Sättler divorced his wife, probably due to his affairs with other women.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Ha10|Hakl 2010]]. p. 10-11.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Sättler and the Adonistic Society: 1926-1931 ===
Being released from the German prison, Sättler returned to Austria in 1926, settling down in the city of [[Vienna]]. It was here that he first began propagating Adonism through the foundation of his Adonistic Society (known as the ''Adonistische Gesellschaft'' in his native German language), and "According to its published constitution and bylaws, this group was founded on 1 May 1925 - in other words, one year before Sättler actually came back to Vienna."&lt;ref&gt;[[#Ha10|Hakl 2010]]. p. 11.&lt;/ref&gt; "By 1927 Sättler had developed the whole doctrine of Adonism and written all the major treatises on it", declaring in the Society's constitution that the main group was also accompanied by the Adonistic Publishing House, the Master Lodge Hekate in Vienna, and various study lodges scattered across the German-speaking part of Europe. Whether these genuinely existed or not is unknown, although it is quite possible that they didn't, as his Adonistic Society was relatively small, not even being a registered organisation and the Austrian authorities in fact suspected him of being guilty of criminal fraud.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Ha10|Hakl 2010]]. p. 11.&lt;/ref&gt; He also claimed that the Adonistic Society was a sister organisation to an international group known as ''Nizâm-el Khâf'', which he claimed had branches in [[Mumbai|Bombay]], [[Istanbul|Constantinople]], [[Tehran]] and other major Asian cities; according to scholar Hans Thomas Hakl, this organisation was "almost certainly fictitious".&lt;ref&gt;[[#Ha10|Hakl 2010]]. p. 11.&lt;/ref&gt;

In order to entice interested individuals to join, Sättler described his Adonistic Society as a "large spiritual community" where "magical energies are continuously circulating, the inexhaustible source of which is the Master Lodge Hekate", so named after the [[Hekate|ancient Greek goddess of witchcraft]]. Membership applications and payment were to be sent directly to Sättler, and new members had to wait two years before they were permitted to learn the "deeper secrets" of Adonism, before they would be allowed to subscribe to a twelve-lesson course ending in an exam, successful completion of which would allow them to attain the third degree of a ''Châkim Kabâlit'', or a master of magic.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Ha10|Hakl 2010]]. p. 12.&lt;/ref&gt;

Sättler likely began an affair with his assistant in the Hekate Lodge, Justine Schnattinger, who herself worked under the pseudonym of "Madame Ariela" as a [[clairvoyant]], [[spirit medium]] and astrological councillor. Sättler was also a friend of the occultist [[Friedrich Wilhelm Quintscher]], who had joined the Society, but in 1929 their friendship broke up, possibly due to jealousy over Schnattinger. Quintscher remained devoted to the Adonist religion, continuing to propagate "its doctrine, cosmology, and principles even after he had broken with Sättler" and founding an Adonistic group called the Ateschga-Taganosyn. One of the members of this group was Brother Silias, also known as Josef Anton Schuster (1896–1968), who wrote a magical diary that became famous among the German occult movement.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Ha10|Hakl 2010]]. p. 12-13.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== The decline and death of Sättler: 1932-1942 ===
Although he had published a wide variety of books, both occult-based and otherwise (including a joke book), and had become entirely financially reliant on his publisher, Bartels of [[Berlin]], he was finding it very hard to make a living. In 1929 he began selling magical cures and other items which included talismans, love potions and even powder that allegedly belonged to the [[Dalai Lama]] to supplement this income, as well as founding a stock company called Olbia-Gold, through which he defrauded stock holders by telling them that he had discovered a gold treasure at the foot of [[Mount Olympus]] in Greece. With all these money-making activities that he was involved with, he became embroiled in a financial scandal in 1932, after which various journals began accusing him of being a fraud and a criminal. Facing criminal charges for defrauding customers of the Olbia-Gold company, he fled to Greece, where he was arrested in a case of [[mistaken identity]] by police who suspected him of being "a much more important Czech swindler."&lt;ref&gt;[[#Ha10|Hakl 2010]]. p. 13-14.&lt;/ref&gt;

Investigating his papers in Vienna, police came upon a list of the eighty German members of the Adonistic Society, causing yet another scandal in the press, who felt it shocking that so many members of "high society" were involved with such a secretive occult group that they accused of committing [[orgy|sexual orgies]]. With Sättler out of reach, police instead began investigating Quintscher and his alternate Adonist group, but he denied a continuing connection to his former friend. Meanwhile, Sättler continued with the Society, this time based in Greece, finding a new publisher, Biosophischer Verlag, who began printing his new monthly magazine, entitled ''Lucifer''. Finding it hard to get new members (who would bring with them the membership fees and donations that he needed to survive), Sättler dissolved the Hekate Lodge and renamed the Society the Alliance of Orion (''Orion Bund'' in German). Nonetheless, the group was having significant problems within Germany itself as it faced opposition from the [[Nazi Party]] who had recently taken control of the government, with some figures in the regime declaring the group to be a part of a [[Jews|Jewish]]-[[Freemason conspiracy|Masonic conspiracy]].&lt;ref&gt;[[#Ha10|Hakl 2010]]. p. 14-15.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1935, Sättler had apparently left Greece and moved to [[Petralka]] in [[Slovakia]], from where he offered courses in nature healing and magic. Meanwhile, in Germany, the Nazi government banned all quasi-Masonic organisations in July 1937, and while initially the Alliance of Orion was unusually exempt, they too were illegalised in June 1939. In the early 1940s, the Nazis ordered the invasion of much of the rest of Europe, leading to the [[Second World War]], and it was in this period that all historical trace of Sättler vanishes. It is unknown how he died, although it has been claimed that it was either in a Vienna prison or in [[Mauthausen concentration camp]], although neither of these remain proven.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Ha10|Hakl 2010]]. p. 15-16.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Adonism after Sättler: 1943-present ===
The first attempt to recreate the Adonist Society occurred in the 1950s by "an otherwise unknown" individual known as Walter Koblizek. He lived in [[Rosenheim]] near [[Munich]] in [[West Germany]], and published a brochure announcing the re-creation of the group, but nothing more appeared of it, and Koblizek died in 1967.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Ha10|Hakl 2010]]. p. 06.&lt;/ref&gt;

Professor Adolf Hemberger (1929–1991), the holder of the Chair for Scientific Theory and Methodology of Research at the [[University of Gießen]], collected Sättler's rare works, making copies of them through [[mimeograph]]ing or [[photocopy]]ing them and distributing them among his friends and members of his magical study groups, C 72. In the 1970s, Hemberger had plans of reviving the Adonist Society, but these never came to fruition.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Ha10|Hakl 2010]]. p. 06.&lt;/ref&gt;

Another German academic, Professor Helmut Möller of the [[University of Göttingen]], published a German language essay on Sättler in a 1990 ''festschrift'' in honour of Ellic Howe, an academic who had specialised in the study of ceremonial magical groups like the [[Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn]] and the [[Ordo Templi Orientis]].&lt;ref&gt;[[#Möl90|Möller 1990]].&lt;/ref&gt; His work was expanded upon by Hans Thomas Hakl, an Austrian independent scholar, who also made an examination of Sättler in the German language, which he followed by publishing an edited version in the English language, appearing in ''The Pomegranate: The International Journal of Pagan Studies'' (2010).&lt;ref&gt;[[#Ha10|Hakl 2010]]. p. 07.&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''basidiospore''' is a reproductive [[spore]] produced by [[Basidiomycete]] [[fungi]], a grouping that includes [[mushroom]]s, [[shelf fungus|shelf fungi]], [[rust fungus|rusts]], and [[smut (fungus)|smut]]s. Basidiospores typically each contain one [[haploid]] [[nucleus (biology)|nucleus]] that is the product of [[meiosis]], and they are produced by specialized fungal cells called [[basidium|basidia]]. Typically, four basidiospores develop on appendages from each basidium , out of these 2 are of one [[Strain (biology)|strain]] and other 2 of its opposite strain. In gills under a cap of one common species, there exist millions of basidia.  Some gilled mushrooms in the order [[Agaricales]] have the ability to release billions of spores.&lt;ref name="Halbwachs 2015" /&gt; The [[puffball]] fungus ''[[Calvatia gigantea]]'' has been calculated to produce about five trillion basidiospores.&lt;ref name="Li 2011" /&gt; Most basidiospores are forcibly discharged, and are thus considered ballistospores.&lt;ref name="Watkinson 2015" /&gt; These spores serve as the main air dispersal units for the fungi. The spores are released during periods of high humidity and generally have a night-time or pre-dawn peak concentration in the atmosphere.&lt;ref name="Halbwachs 2015" /&gt;

When basidiospores encounter a favorable substrate, they may [[germination|germinate]], typically by forming [[hyphae]]. These hyphae grow outward from the original spore, forming an expanding circle of [[mycelium]]. The circular shape of a fungal colony explains the formation of [[fairy ring]]s, and also the circular lesions of skin-infecting fungi that cause [[ringworm]]. Some basidiospores germinate repetitively by forming small spores instead of hyphae.

==General structure and shape==
Basidiospores are generally characterized by an attachment peg (called a [[hilum (biology)|hilar appendage]]) on its surface. This is where the spore was attached to the basidium. The hilar appendage is quite prominent in some basidiospores, but less evident in others. An apical [[germ pore]] may also be present. Many basidiospores have an asymmetric shape due to their development on the basidium.&lt;ref name="Watkinson 2015"/&gt; Basidiospores are typically single-celled (without [[septum|septa]]), and typically range from spherical to oval to oblong, to ellipsoid or cylindrical. The surface of the spore can be fairly smooth, or it can be ornamented.&lt;ref name="Halbwachs 2015"/&gt; The color of the [[spore print]] is usually found in the [[cell wall|spore wall]], although in rare instances – like the yellow spores of ''[[Clavaria helicoides]]'' – the [[cytoplasm]] is responsible for the spore color.&lt;ref name="Donk 1963"/&gt;

'''Bioenergetics''' is a field in [[biochemistry]] and [[cell biology]] that concerns [[energy]] flow through living systems.&lt;ref&gt; Nelson, David L., Cox, Michael M. ''Lehninger: Principles of Biochemistry.'' New York: W.H. Freeman and Company, 2013. Sixth ed., pg 24. &lt;/ref&gt; This is an active area of [[Biology|biological]] research that includes the study of the transformation of energy in living organisms and the study of thousands of different [[Cell (biology)|cellular]] processes such as [[cellular respiration]] and the many other [[metabolism|metabolic]] and [[Enzyme|enzymatic]] processes that lead to production and utilization of energy in forms such as [[adenosine triphosphate]] (ATP) molecules.&lt;ref&gt; Green, D.E., Vande Zande, H.A (1981). Universal energy principle of biological systems and the unity of bioenergetics. ''Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.,'' '''78''' 9: 5344- 5347. https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC348741/pdf/pnas00660-0107.pdf Accessed 9 April 2017. &lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt; Nelson, David L., Cox, Michael M. ''Lehninger: Principles of Biochemistry.'' New York: W.H. Freeman and Company, 2013. Sixth ed., pg. 27. &lt;/ref&gt; That is, the goal of bioenergetics is to describe how living organisms acquire and transform energy in order to perform biological work.&lt;ref&gt; Nelson, David L., Cox, Michael M. ''Lehninger: Principles of Biochemistry.'' New York: W.H. Freeman and Company, 2013. Sixth ed., pg. 24. &lt;/ref&gt; The study of [[metabolic network|metabolic pathways]] is thus essential to bioenergetics.

==Overview==

Bioenergetics is the part of biochemistry concerned with the energy involved in making and breaking of chemical bonds in the [[molecules]] found in biological [[organism]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Ferrick D.A., Neilson A., Beeson C (2008). Advances in measuring cellular bioenergetics using extracellular flux. ''Drug Discovery Today,'' '''13''' 5 &amp; 6: 268- 274. http://www.wklab.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/Advances-in-measuring-cellular-bioenergetics-using-extracellular-flux-Drug-Discovery-Today-2008.pdf Accessed 9 April 2017. &lt;/ref&gt; It can also be defined as the study of energy relationships and energy transformations and transductions in living organisms.&lt;ref&gt;Nelson, David L., Cox, Michael M. ''Lehninger: Principles of Biochemistry.'' New York: W.H. Freeman and Company, 2013. Sixth ed., pg. 506. &lt;/ref&gt; The ability to harness energy from a variety of metabolic pathways is a property of all living organisms. [[Cell growth|Growth]], [[Developmental biology|development]], [[anabolism]] and [[catabolism]] are some of the central processes in the study of biological organisms, because the role of energy is fundamental to such [[biological process]]es.&lt;ref&gt;Nelson, David L., Cox, Michael M. ''Lehninger: Principles of Biochemistry.'' New York: W.H. Freeman and Company, 2013. Sixth ed., pg. 28. &lt;/ref&gt; [[Life]] is dependent on [[energy transformation]]s; living organisms survive because of exchange of energy between living tissues/ cells and the outside environment. Some organisms, such as [[autotrophs]], can acquire energy from sunlight (through [[photosynthesis]]) without needing to consume nutrients and break them down.&lt;ref&gt;Nelson, David L., Cox, Michael M. ''Lehninger: Principles of Biochemistry.'' New York: W.H. Freeman and Company, 2013. Sixth ed., pg. 22. &lt;/ref&gt; Other organisms, like [[heterotrophs]], must intake nutrients from food to be able to sustain energy by breaking down chemical bonds in nutrients during metabolic processes such as [[glycolysis]] and [[Citric acid cycle|the citric acid cycle]]. Importantly, as a direct consequence of the [[First Law of Thermodynamics]], autotrophs and heterotrophs participate in a universal metabolic network—by eating autotrophs (plants), heterotrophs harness energy that was initially transformed by the plants during [[photosynthesis]].&lt;ref&gt;Nelson, David L., Cox, Michael M. ''Lehninger: Principles of Biochemistry.'' New York: W.H. Freeman and Company, 2013. Sixth ed., pgs. 22, 506. &lt;/ref&gt;

In a living organism, [[chemical bond]]s are broken and made as part of the exchange and transformation of energy. Energy is available for work (such as mechanical work) or for other processes (such as chemical synthesis and [[anabolism|anabolic]] processes in growth), when weak bonds are broken and stronger bonds are made. The production of stronger bonds allows release of usable energy.

Adenosine triphosphate ([[Adenosine triphosphate|ATP]]) is the main "energy currency" for organisms; the goal of metabolic and catabolic processes are to synthesize ATP from available starting materials (from the environment), and to break- down ATP (into adenosine diphosphate ([[Adenosine diphosphate|ADP]]) and inorganic phosphate) by utilizing it in biological processes.&lt;ref&gt; Nelson, David L., Cox, Michael M. ''Lehninger: Principles of Biochemistry.'' New York: W.H. Freeman and Company, 2013. Sixth ed., pg. 24. &lt;/ref&gt; In a cell, the ratio of ATP to ADP concentrations is known as the "[[energy charge]]" of the cell.  A cell can use this energy charge to relay information about cellular needs; if there is more ATP than ADP available, the cell can use ATP to do work, but if there is more ADP than ATP available, the cell must synthesize ATP via oxidative phosphorylation.&lt;ref&gt; Ferrick D.A., Neilson A., Beeson C (2008). Advances in measuring cellular bioenergetics using extracellular flux. ''Drug Discovery Today,'' '''13''' 5 &amp; 6: 268- 274. http://www.wklab.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/Advances-in-measuring-cellular-bioenergetics-using-extracellular-flux-Drug-Discovery-Today-2008.pdf Accessed 9 April 2017. &lt;/ref&gt;

Living organisms produce ATP from energy sources via [[oxidative phosphorylation]].  The terminal phosphate bonds of ATP are relatively weak compared with the stronger bonds formed when ATP is [[Hydrolysis|hydrolyzed]] (broken down by water) to adenosine diphosphate and inorganic phosphate. Here it is the thermodynamically favorable free energy of hydrolysis that results in energy release; the phosphoanhydride bond between the terminal phosphate group and the rest of the ATP molecule does not itself contain this energy.&lt;ref&gt; Nelson, David L., Cox, Michael M. ''Lehninger: Principles of Biochemistry.'' New York: W.H. Freeman and Company, 2013. Sixth ed., pg. 522- 523. &lt;/ref&gt; An organism's stockpile of ATP is used as a battery to store energy in cells.&lt;ref&gt; Hardie, D.G., Ross, F.A., Hawley, S.A (2012). AMPK: a nutrient and energy sensor that maintains energy homeostasis. ''Nature,'' '''13''' 251- 262. http://www.nature.com/nrm/journal/v13/n4/pdf/nrm3311.pdf Accessed 9 April 2017. &lt;/ref&gt;  Utilization of chemical energy from such molecular bond rearrangement powers biological processes in every biological organism.

Living organisms obtain energy from organic and inorganic materials; i.e. ATP can be synthesized from a variety of biochemical precursors.  For example, [[lithotroph]]s can oxidize minerals such as [[nitrate]]s or forms of [[sulfur]], such as elemental sulfur, [[sulfite]]s, and [[hydrogen sulfide]] to produce ATP.  In [[photosynthesis]], [[autotroph]]s produce ATP using light energy, whereas [[Heterotroph|heterotrophs]] must consume organic compounds, mostly including [[carbohydrate]]s, [[fat]]s, and [[protein]]s.  The amount of energy actually obtained by the organism is lower than the [[Food energy|amount present in the food]]; there are losses in digestion, metabolism, and [[thermogenesis]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fao.org/docrep/006/Y5022E/y5022e04.htm FAO, Calculation of the Energy Content of Foods—Energy Conversion Factors]&lt;/ref&gt;

Environmental materials that an organism intakes are generally combined with [[oxygen]] to release energy, although some can also be oxidized anaerobically by various organisms.  The bonds holding the molecules of [[nutrient]]s together and in particular the bonds holding molecules of free oxygen together are relatively weak compared with the chemical bonds holding carbon dioxide and water together.&lt;ref name="Schmidt-Rohr 15"&gt;{{cite journal | author = Schmidt-Rohr K | year = 2015 | title = Why Combustions Are Always Exothermic, Yielding About 418 kJ per Mole of O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; | doi = 10.1021/acs.jchemed.5b00333 | journal = J. Chem. Educ. | volume = 92 | issue = 12| pages = 2094–2099 | bibcode = 2015JChEd..92.2094S }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The utilization of these materials is a form of slow [[combustion]] because the nutrients are reacted with oxygen (the materials are oxidized slowly enough that the organisms do not actually produce fire). The oxidation releases energy because stronger bonds (bonds within water and carbon dioxide) have been formed.  This net energy may evolve as heat, which may be used by the organism for other purposes, such as breaking other bonds to do chemistry required for survival.

==Types of reactions==

* An '''exergonic''' reaction is a spontaneous chemical reaction that releases energy.&lt;ref&gt; Nelson, David L., Cox, Michael M. ''Lehninger: Principles of Biochemistry.'' New York: W.H. Freeman and Company, 2013. Sixth ed., pg. 24. &lt;/ref&gt; It is thermodynamically favored, indexed by a negative value of ΔG ([[Gibbs free energy]]). Over the course of a reaction, energy needs to be put in, and this activation energy drives the reactants from a stable state to a highly energetically unstable transition state to a more stable state that is lower in energy (see: [[reaction coordinate]]). The reactants are usually complex molecules that are broken into simpler products. The entire reaction is usually [[Catabolism|catabolic]].&lt;ref&gt; Nelson, David L., Cox, Michael M. ''Lehninger: Principles of Biochemistry.'' New York: W.H. Freeman and Company, 2013. Sixth ed., pg. 502. &lt;/ref&gt; The release of energy (called Gibbs free energy) is negative (i.e. −ΔG) because energy is released from the reactants to the products.
* An '''endergonic''' reaction is an anabolic chemical reaction that consumes energy.&lt;ref&gt; Nelson, David L., Cox, Michael M. ''Lehninger: Principles of Biochemistry.'' New York: W.H. Freeman and Company, 2013. Sixth ed., pg. 27. &lt;/ref&gt; It is the opposite of an exergonic reaction. It has a positive ΔG because it takes more energy to break the bonds of the reactant than the energy of the products offer, i.e. the products have weaker bonds than the reactants. Thus, endergonic reactions are thermodynamically unfavorable. Additionally, endergonic reactions are usually [[Anabolism|anabolic]].&lt;ref&gt; Nelson, David L., Cox, Michael M. ''Lehninger: Principles of Biochemistry.'' New York: W.H. Freeman and Company, 2013. Sixth ed., pg. 503. &lt;/ref&gt;

The free energy (ΔG) gained or lost in a reaction can be calculated as follows: ΔG = ΔH − TΔS
where ∆G = [[Gibbs free energy]], ∆H = [[enthalpy]], T = temperature (in [[kelvin]]s), and ∆S = [[entropy]].&lt;ref&gt; Nelson, David L., Cox, Michael M. ''Lehninger: Principles of Biochemistry.'' New York: W.H. Freeman and Company, 2013. Sixth ed., p. 23. &lt;/ref&gt;

==Examples of major bioenergetic processes==

*[[Glycolysis]] is the process of breaking down glucose into [[pyruvate]], producing two molecules of ATP (per 1 molecule of glucose) in the process.&lt;ref&gt; Nelson, David L., Cox, Michael M. ''Lehninger: Principles of Biochemistry.'' New York: W.H. Freeman and Company, 2013. Sixth ed., pg 544. &lt;/ref&gt; When a cell has a higher concentration of ATP than ADP (i.e. has a high [[energy charge]]), the cell can undergo glycolysis, releasing energy from available glucose to perform biological work. Pyruvate is one product of glycolysis, and can be shuttled into other metabolic pathways (gluconeogenesis, etc.) as needed by the cell. Additionally, glycolysis produces [[reducing equivalents]] in the form of [[Nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide|NADH]] (nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide), which will ultimately be used to donate electrons to the [[Electron Transport Chain|electron transport chain]].

*[[Gluconeogenesis]] is the opposite of glycolysis; when the cell's energy charge is low (the concentration of ADP is higher than that of ATP), the cell must synthesize glucose from carbon- containing biomolecules such as proteins, amino acids, fats, pyruvate, etc.&lt;ref&gt; Nelson, David L., Cox, Michael M. ''Lehninger: Principles of Biochemistry.'' New York: W.H. Freeman and Company, 2013. Sixth ed., pg 568. &lt;/ref&gt; For example, proteins can be broken down into amino acids, and these simpler carbon skeletons are used to build/ synthesize glucose. 

*[[Citric acid cycle|The citric acid cycle]] is a process of [[cellular respiration]] in which [[Acetyl-CoA|acetyl coenzyme A]], synthesized from [[Pyruvate dehydrogenase complex|pyruvate dehydrogenase]], is first reacted with [[oxaloacetate]] to yield [[citrate]].&lt;ref&gt; Nelson, David L., Cox, Michael M. ''Lehninger: Principles of Biochemistry.'' New York: W.H. Freeman and Company, 2013. Sixth ed., pg 633. &lt;/ref&gt; The remaining eight reactions produce other carbon-containing metabolites. These metabolites are successively oxidized, and the free energy of oxidation is conserved in the form of the reduced coenzymes [[Flavin adenine dinucleotide|FADH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;]] and [[Nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide|NADH]].&lt;ref&gt; Nelson, David L., Cox, Michael M. ''Lehninger: Principles of Biochemistry.'' New York: W.H. Freeman and Company, 2013. Sixth ed., pg 640. &lt;/ref&gt; These reduced electron carriers can then be re-oxidized when they transfer electrons to the [[electron transport chain]]. 

*[[Ketosis]] is a metabolic process whereby ketone bodies are used by the cell for energy (instead of using glucose). Cells often turn to ketosis as a source of energy when glucose levels are low; e.g. during starvation.&lt;ref&gt; Owen, O.E. (2005) Ketone Bodies as a Fuel for the Brain during Starvation. ''The International Union of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology.'' '''33''':4, 246- 251. &lt;/ref&gt;

*[[Oxidative phosphorylation]] and the [[electron transport chain]] is the process where reducing equivalents such as [[Nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate|NADPH]], [[Flavin adenine dinucleotide|FADH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;]] and [[Nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide|NADH]] can be used to donate electrons to a series of redox reactions that take place in electron transport chain complexes.&lt;ref&gt; Nelson, David L., Cox, Michael M. ''Lehninger: Principles of Biochemistry.'' New York: W.H. Freeman and Company, 2013. Sixth ed., pg 731. &lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt; Nelson, David L., Cox, Michael M. ''Lehninger: Principles of Biochemistry.'' New York: W.H. Freeman and Company, 2013. Sixth ed., pg 734. &lt;/ref&gt; These redox reactions take place in enzyme complexes situated within the mitochondrial membrane. These redox reactions transfer electrons "down" the electron transport chain, which is coupled to the [[Chemiosmosis|proton motive force]]. This difference in proton concentration between the mitochondrial matrix and inner membrane space is used to drive ATP synthesis via [[ATP Synthase|ATP synthase]].

*[[Photosynthesis]], another major bioenergetic process, is the metabolic pathway used by plants in which solar energy is used to synthesize glucose from carbon dioxide and water. This reaction takes place in the [[chloroplast]]. After glucose is synthesized, the plant cell can undergo [[photophosphorylation]] to produce ATP.&lt;ref&gt; Nelson, David L., Cox, Michael M. ''Lehninger: Principles of Biochemistry.'' New York: W.H. Freeman and Company, 2013. Sixth ed., pg 731. &lt;/ref&gt;

==Cotransport==
In August 1960, [[Robert K. Crane]] presented for the first time his discovery of the sodium-glucose [[Co-transport|cotransport]] as the mechanism for intestinal glucose absorption.&lt;ref&gt;[[Robert K. Crane]], D. Miller and I. Bihler. "The restrictions on possible mechanisms of intestinal transport of sugars". In: Membrane Transport and Metabolism. Proceedings of a Symposium held in Prague, August 22–27, 1960. Edited by A. Kleinzeller and A. Kotyk. [[Academy of Sciences of the Czech Republic|Czech Academy of Sciences]], Prague, 1961, pp. 439-449.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Robert K. Crane|Crane's]] discovery of [[Co-transport|cotransport]] was the first ever proposal of flux coupling in biology and was the most important event concerning carbohydrate absorption in the 20th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1007/s00424-003-1063-6 |author=Wright, Ernest M. |author2=Turk, Eric |title=The sodium glucose cotransport family SLC5 |journal=Pflügers Arch |volume=447 |pages=510–8 |year=2004 |url=http://www.springerlink.com/content/c7ryue6u68ge924t/fulltext.pdf?page=1 |quote=[[Robert K. Crane|Crane]] in 1961 was the first to formulate the [[Co-transport|cotransport]]  concept to explain active transport [7]. Specifically, he  proposed that the accumulation of glucose in the intestinal  epithelium across the brush border membrane was coupled to downhill {{chem|Na|+}} transport cross the brush border. This hypothesis was rapidly tested, refined and extended [to] encompass the active transport of a diverse range of molecules and ions into virtually every cell type. |pmid=12748858 |issue=5}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1113/expphysiol.2007.037523 |author=Boyd, C A R |title=Facts, fantasies and fun in epithelial physiology |journal=Experimental Physiology |volume=93 |issue=3 |pages=303–14 |year=2008 |url=http://www3.interscience.wiley.com/cgi-bin/fulltext/119410531/main.html,ftx_abs#b12 |quote=the insight from this time that remains in all current text books is the notion of [[Robert K. Crane|Robert Crane]] published originally as an appendix to a symposium paper published in 1960 ([[Robert K. Crane|Crane]] et al. 1960). The key point here was 'flux coupling', the [[Co-transport|cotransport]] of sodium and glucose in the apical membrane of the small intestinal epithelial cell. Half a century later this idea has turned into one of the most studied of all transporter proteins (SGLT1), the sodium–glucose [[Co-transport|cotransport]]er. |pmid=18192340}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Chemiosmotic theory==
One of the major triumphs of bioenergetics is [[Peter D. Mitchell]]'s [[Chemiosmosis|chemiosmotic theory]] of how [[proton]]s in aqueous solution function in the production of ATP in cell [[organelle]]s such as [[Mitochondrion|mitochondria]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author=Peter Mitchell | title=Coupling of phosphorylation to electron and hydrogen transfer by a chemi-osmotic type of mechanism | journal=Nature | year=1961 | volume=191 | pages= 144–8 | doi=10.1038/191144a0 | pmid=13771349 | issue=4784 | bibcode=1961Natur.191..144M}}&lt;/ref&gt; This work earned Mitchell the 1978 [[Nobel Prize for Chemistry]]. Other cellular sources of ATP such as [[glycolysis]] were understood first, but such processes for direct coupling of [[enzyme]] activity to ATP production are not the major source of useful chemical energy in most cells. Chemiosmotic coupling is the major energy producing process in most cells, being utilized in [[chloroplast]]s and several [[Three-domain system|single celled]] organisms in addition to mitochondria.

==Energy balance==

[[Energy homeostasis]] is the [[Homeostasis#Biological|homeostatic]] control of [[Energy balance (biology)|energy balance]]&amp;nbsp;– the difference between energy obtained through food consumption and energy expenditure&amp;nbsp;– in living systems.&lt;ref name="NHM-#"&gt;{{cite book | vauthors = Malenka RC, Nestler EJ, Hyman SE | editor = Sydor A, Brown RY | title = Molecular Neuropharmacology: A Foundation for Clinical Neuroscience | year = 2009 | publisher = McGraw-Hill Medical | location = New York | isbn = 9780071481274 | pages = 179, 262–263 | edition = 2nd | quote = Orexin neurons are regulated by peripheral mediators that carry information about energy balance, including glucose, leptin, and ghrelin.&amp;nbsp;... Accordingly, orexin plays a role in the regulation of energy homeostasis, reward, and perhaps more generally in emotion.&amp;nbsp;... The regulation of energy balance involves the exquisite coordination of food intake and energy expenditure. Experiments in the 1940s and 1950s showed that lesions of the lateral hypothalamus (LH) reduced food intake; hence, the normal role of this brain area is to stimulate feeding and decrease energy utilization. In contrast, lesions of the medial hypothalamus, especially the ventromedial nucleus (VMH) but also the PVN and dorsomedial hypothalamic nucleus (DMH), increased food intake; hence, the normal role of these regions is to suppress feeding and increase energy utilization. Yet discovery of the complex networks of neuropeptides and other neurotransmitters acting within the hypothalamus and other brain regions to regulate food intake and energy expenditure began in earnest in 1994 with the cloning of the leptin (ob, for obesity) gene. Indeed, there is now explosive interest in basic feeding mechanisms given the epidemic proportions of obesity in our society, and the increased toll of the eating disorders, anorexia nervosa and bulimia. Unfortunately, despite dramatic advances in the basic neurobiology of feeding, our understanding of the etiology of these conditions and our ability to intervene clinically remain limited.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Homeostatic control of energy balance"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Morton GJ, Meek TH, Schwartz MW | title = Neurobiology of food intake in health and disease | journal = Nat. Rev. Neurosci. | volume = 15 | issue = 6 | pages = 367–378 | date = 2014 | pmid = 24840801 | pmc = 4076116 | doi = 10.1038/nrn3745 | quote = However, in normal individuals, body weight and body fat content are typically quite stable over time&lt;sup&gt;2,3&lt;/sup&gt; owing to a biological process termed ‘energy homeostasis’ that matches energy intake to expenditure over long periods of time. The energy homeostasis system comprises neurons in the mediobasal hypothalamus and other brain areas&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt; that are a part of a neurocircuit that regulates food intake in response to input from humoral signals that circulate at concentrations proportionate to body fat content&lt;sup&gt;4-6&lt;/sup&gt;.&amp;nbsp;... An emerging concept in the neurobiology of food intake is that neurocircuits exist that are normally inhibited, but when activated in response to emergent or stressful stimuli they can override the homeostatic control of energy balance. Understanding how these circuits interact with the energy homeostasis system is fundamental to understanding the control of food intake and may bear on the pathogenesis of disorders at both ends of the body weight spectrum.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Campus Galli''' is a [[Carolingian]] [[monastic community]] under construction in [[Meßkirch]], [[Baden-Württemberg]], [[Germany]]. The construction project includes plans to build a medieval monastery according to the early ninth-century [[Plan of Saint Gall]] using techniques from that era. The long-term financing of the project is to come from revenue generated from the site's operation as a tourist attraction. The construction site has been open for visitors since June 2013.&lt;ref&gt;Campus Galli - karolingische Klosterstadt Meßkirch [http://www.campus-galli.de/ "Herzlich willkommen bei Campus Galli - karolingische Klosterstadt"] (in German).&lt;/ref&gt;

== Construction Site ==
[[File:Campus Galli-Schmied153918.jpg|thumb|right|Blacksmith's hut]]
[[File:Campus galli 2014 02.JPG|thumbnail|Chapel Building]]
The Carolingian monastery town is being constructed in a wooded area approximately four kilometers north of the small town of Meßkirch in southern Germany. The buildings are being built according to the Plan of Saint Gall, which is the only surviving major architectural drawing from the middle-ages. The construction of the monastery town will be accomplished as much as possible with the materials and methods of the time of [[Charlemagne]] in keeping with goals of [[Experimental archaeology]],&lt;ref&gt;EXARC, [http://exarc.net/venues/campus-galli-de "Campus Galli"], EXARC is the ICOM Affiliated Organisation representing archaeological open-air museums, experimental archaeology, ancient technology and interpretation.&lt;/ref&gt; thereby increasing our scientific knowledge of Carolingian architecture and engineering. The major raw materials, such as wood and stone, will be obtained from the site.

Between 20 and 30 staff members will be permanently at the site, with an exception according to the Medieval custom for resting during the winter months from November 11 (St. Martin's day) until April 2 (Charlemagne's birthday). The total construction time is estimated at forty years. Volunteer workers not only help with the construction, but also act as costumed interpreters.&lt;ref&gt;Andreas Sturm, Sybille A. Beyer: ''[http://www.karolingischeklosterstadt.com/KKS_Manuskript_Projektvorstellung_Freiburg_2009.pdf Building the Plan of Saint Gall.

The project was launched by the Aachen-based journalist [[Bert Geurten]] with 1 million euros provided by city, state and European-Union sources.&lt;ref&gt;Angelika Franz, [http://www.spiegel.de/international/zeitgeist/medieval-monastery-town-to-be-built-in-southern-germany-a-822375.html "Ox Carts and No Coffee: Building a Monastery the Medieval Way"], ''Spiegel Online International'', 21 March 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; An Advisory Board of 18 experts in fields including archaeology, history, theology, and veterinary medicine will provide the scientific management and monitoring of the construction.&lt;ref&gt;Andreas Sturm, [https://docs.google.com/file/d/0B_WFuuxB5nojOU81aWFtNHJpMFE/edit?usp=sharing&amp;pli=1 "Konzeptionelle Mängel in der Umsetzung des Projektes „Campus Galli – karolingische klosterstadt messkirch""], 26 March 2013 (in German).&lt;/ref&gt;

== Construction Progress ==
A small area in the forest was cleared by the end of June 2013, and temporary shelters for the craftsmen were built.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.welt.de/geschichte/article117410272/So-schufteten-sie-im-Reich-Karls-des-Grossen.html "So schufteten sie im Reich Karls des Großen"], ''Die Welt'', 24 June 2013 {{de icon}}.&lt;/ref&gt;
A map of the site&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.campus-galli.de/besuchen/#rundgang "Site map of Campus Galli"], ''Karolingische Klosterstadt Meßkirch'', {{de icon}}.&lt;/ref&gt; shows areas for carpenters, basket weavers, potters, blacksmiths, stonemasons, wood turners, broom makers, roofers, textile workers, and rope makers. There are also pens for pigs, goats and sheep, and a chicken coop, along with a bee hive. There is a herb garden for healer's plants. In the center of the site is the ongoing construction of a wooden church.

The '''Centre for Climate Change Economics and Policy''' ('''CCCEP''') is a climate change research centre in [[England]]. It is hosted jointly by the [[University of Leeds]] and the [[London School of Economics and Political Science]] (LSE).

CCCEP is part of the [[Grantham Research Institute on Climate Change and the Environment]], which is chaired by Lord [[Nicholas Stern]] of Brentford, former [[Chief Economist]] of the [[World Bank]] and author of the widely known [[Stern Review]].&lt;ref&gt;Richard Black, [http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/science/nature/8571347.stm Copenhagen climate summit undone by 'arrogance'], [[BBC News]], 16 March 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

CCCEP was established in 2008, and is funded by the [[ESRC]].{{fact|date=December 2013}}
Its mission is to advance public and private action on climate change through rigorous, innovative research.
In pursuit of its mission, CCCEP has five research themes in its phase 2 programme:{{fact|date=November 2013}}

# ''Understanding green growth and climate-compatible development''
# ''Advancing climate finance and investment''
# ''Evaluating the performance of climate policies''
# ''Managing climate risks and uncertainties and strengthening climate services''
# ''Enabling rapid transitions in mitigation and adaptation''

In October 2016, The Daily mail reported allegations that CCCEP had fraudulently obtained millions of dollars from UK taxpayers by claiming credit for research they did not produce.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-3863462/Exposed-university-helped-secure-9million-money-passing-rivals-research-bankroll-climate-change-agenda.html&lt;/ref&gt; The organization responded to the claims saying that the alleged fraud was an overreaction to a clerical error. &lt;ref&gt;http://www.cccep.ac.uk/news/response-to-article-by-david-rose-in-the-mail-on-sunday/&lt;/ref&gt;

'''The Centre for Development Studies''' (CDS), [[Trivandrum]], Kerala, India is a social science research institution. Its main objective is to promote research, teaching and training in disciplines relevant to development. 

The institute was established in 1971 by the economist [[Professor]] [[K. N. Raj]].

== Overview ==
Set up in 1971 by the late legendary economist Professor K.N. Raj, the Centre for Development Studies (CDS) is a self-governing institution known for its research in applied economics and topics germane to socio-economic development, pedagogy, and training programmes.  TCDS is housed in Prasanth Nagar, a hamlet off the [[Thiruvananthapuram]] city. It is easily accessible by road, rail and air.  The 10 acre campus is designed and delivered by late [[Laurie Baker]].  The K. N. Raj Library at CDS is one of the biggest repositories of books in South India with over 1,700,000 titles in economics and related disciplines and subscribing to about 260 print and 1800 online professional journals. It has a faculty strength of about 20.{{cn|date=August 2018}}

Research at CDS is organised into six distinct themes:

* [[Agriculture]] and [[Natural Resource]]
* [[Gender]], [[Human migration|Migration]], [[Population]]
* [[Health]] and [[Education]]
* [[Poverty]], [[Vulnerability]] and [[Social security|Social Security]]
* [[Industry]]
* [[Trade]] and [[Technology]]
There is a seventh cross-cutting theme, analysing the impact of globalisation on each of the six themes.

The teaching programme of the CDS includes:

*A two-year M.A. Programme in [[Applied Economics]]
*A two-year M.Phil. Programme in [[Applied Economics]]
*A four-year Ph.D. Programme in [[Economics]].
All three programmes are affiliated to [[Jawaharlal Nehru University, Delhi|Jawaharlal Nehru University]], New Delhi.  The [[University of Kerala]] also has recognised CDS as a Centre for its doctoral studies. Besides, it has a number of short-duration occasional training programmes.

==The Organizational Structure==
The core financial support to the Centre comes from the Government of Kerala and the [[Indian Council of Social Science Research]]. [[Reserve Bank of India]] and the [[Planning Commission of India]] have instituted endowment units for research in selected areas at CDS.  The Union Ministry of Overseas Indian Affairs has established a migration unit at CDS to study issues relating to international migration from India.

The governance of CDS rests with the Governing Body consisting of academicians from across India. It follows a unique{{cn|date=August 2018}} style of decentralization in governance through various bodies assisting the Director in the management.

The present chairman of the Governing Body is Shri. K. M. Chandrasekhar. The current Director is Professor Sunil Mani.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="80863">'''Development aid''' or '''development cooperation''' (also '''development assistance''', '''technical assistance''', '''international aid''', '''overseas aid''', '''official development assistance''' (ODA), or '''foreign aid''') is financial [[aid]] given by governments and other agencies to support the economic, environmental, social, and political [[International development|development]] of [[developing countries]]. It is distinguished from [[humanitarian aid]] by focusing on alleviating poverty in the long term, rather than a short term response.
[[File:Africa Technical Cooperation Grants.jpg|thumb|Technical cooperation grants are one type of development aid.|353x353px]]
The term '''development cooperation''', which is used, for example, by the [[World Health Organization]] (WHO), is used to express the idea that a [[International development#partnership|partnership]] should exist between donor and recipient, rather than the traditional situation in which the relationship was dominated by the wealth and specialised knowledge of one side.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.who.int/trade/glossary/story016/en/index.html WHO glossary of terms, "Development Cooperation"] Accessed 25 January 2008&lt;/ref&gt; Most development aid comes from the Western industrialised countries but some poorer countries also contribute aid.

Aid may be '''bilateral''': given from one country directly to another; or it may be '''multilateral''': given by the donor country to an international organisation such as the [[World Bank]] or the United Nations Agencies ([[UNDP]], [[UNICEF]], [[UNAIDS]], etc.) which then distributes it among the developing countries. The proportion is currently about 70% bilateral 30% multilateral.&lt;ref&gt;OECD Stats. Portal &gt;&gt; Extracts &gt;&gt; Development &gt;&gt; Other &gt;&gt; DAC1 Official and Private Flows. Retrieved April 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

About 80-85% of developmental aid comes from government sources as [[official development assistance]] (ODA). The remaining 15-20% comes from private organisations such as "[[non-governmental organisation]]s" (NGOs), foundations and other [[development charities]] (e.g.,&amp;nbsp;[[Oxfam]]).&lt;ref&gt;OECD, DAC1 Official and Private Flows (''op. cit.''). The calculation is Net Private Grants / ODA.&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, remittances received from migrants working or living in diaspora form a significant amount of international transfer.

Some governments also include military assistance in the notion "foreign aid", although many [[NGO]]s tend to disapprove of this.

Official development assistance is a measure of government-contributed aid, compiled by the [[Development Assistance Committee]] of the [[Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development]] (OECD) since 1969. The DAC consists of 34 of the largest aid-donating countries.

==History==

===Origins===
The concept of development aid goes back to the [[colonial era]] at the turn of the twentieth century, in particular to the British policy of colonial development that emerged during that period. The traditional government policy had tended to favor [[laissez-faire]] style economics, with the free market for capital and goods dictating the economic role that colonies played in the [[British Empire]].

[[Image:British Political Personalities 1936-1945 CH4432.jpg|thumb|250px|[[Walter Guinness, 1st Baron Moyne|Lord Moyne]], as [[Secretary of State for the Colonies]] presided over a Development Committee for the colonies. He is pictured entertaining [[Jamaica]]n recruits for the [[RAF]].]]
Changes in attitudes towards the moral purpose of the Empire, and the role that government could play in the promotion of welfare slowly led to a more proactive policy of economic and developmental assistance towards poor colonies. The first challenge to Britain was the economic crisis that occurred after World War I. Prior to the passage of the 1929 Colonial Development Act, the doctrine that governed Britain (and other European colonizers) with their territories was that of financial self-sufficiency. What this simply meant was that the colonies were responsible for themselves.&lt;ref&gt;Joseph Hodge, Gerald Hodl, &amp; Martin Kopf (edi) Developing Africa: Concepts and Practices in Twentieth-Century Colonialism, Manchester: Manchester University Press, 2014, p.12.&lt;/ref&gt;

Britain was not going to use the money that belongs to the metropole to pay for things in the colonies. The colonies did not only have to pay for infrastructural development but they also were responsible for the salaries of British officials that worked in the colonies. The colonies generated the revenues to pay for these through different forms of taxations. The standard taxation was the import and export taxes. Goods going out of the colonies were taxed and those coming in were also taxed. These generate significant revenues. Apart from these taxes, the colonizers introduced two other forms of taxes: hut tax and labor tax. The hut tax is akin to a property tax today. Every grown up adult male had their own hut. Each of these had to pay a tax. Labor tax was the work that the people had to do without any remunerations or with meager stipends.&lt;ref&gt;Bekeh Utietiang, Planning Development: International Experts, Agricultural Policy, and the Modernization of Nigeria, 1945-1967 (Ph.D Thesis), West Virginia University, Morgantown, 2014, p. 38.&lt;/ref&gt; As the economic crisis widened and had significant impact on the colonies, revenues generated from taxes continued to decline, having a significant impact on the colonies. While this was going on, Britain experienced major unemployment rates. Parliament began to discuss ways in which they could deal with Britain's unemployment rates and at the same time respond to some of the urgent needs of the colonies.&lt;ref&gt;[[Stephen Constantine (historian)|Stephen Constantine]], ''The Making of British Colonial Development Policy, 1914-1940'', London: Frank Cass, 1984, p.183.&lt;/ref&gt; This process culminated in the passage of the Colonial Development Act in 1929, which established a Colonial Development Advisory Committee under the authority of the [[Secretary of State for the Colonies]], then [[Sidney Webb, 1st Baron Passfield|Lord Passfield]]. Its initial annual budget of £1 million was spent on schemes designed to develop the [[infrastructure]] of [[transport]], [[electrical power]] and [[water supply]] in colonies and [[dominion]]s abroad for the furtherance of imperial trade.&lt;ref name="Kanbur"&gt;{{Citation | last1 = Kanbur | first1 = Ravi | author-link1 = Ravi Kanbur | contribution = The economics of international aid | editor-last1 = Kolm | editor-first1 = Serge-Christophe | editor-last2 = Ythier | editor-first2 = Jean Mercier | editor-link1 = Serge-Christophe Kolm | title = Handbook of the economics of giving, altruism and reciprocity: foundations, volume 1 | publisher = Elsevier | location = Amsterdam London | year = 2006 | isbn = 9780444506979  | ref = harv | postscript = .}}&lt;/ref&gt; The 1929 Act, though meager in the resources it made available for development, was a significant Act because it opened the door for Britain to make future investments in the colonies. It was a major shift in colonial development. The doctrine of financial self-sufficiency was abandoned and Britain could now use metropolitan funds to develop the colonies.

By the late 1930s, especially after the [[British West Indian labour unrest of 1934–1939]], it was clear that this initial scheme was far too limited in scope. A [[Royal Commission]] under [[Walter Guinness, 1st Baron Moyne|Lord Moyne]] was sent to investigate the living conditions in the [[British West Indies]] and it published its [[Report of West India Royal Commission (Moyne Report)|Report]] in 1940 which exposed the horrendous living conditions there.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Fraser|first=Cary|title=The Twilight of Colonial Rule in the British West Indies: Nationalist Assertion vs. Imperial Hubris in the 1930s|journal=Journal of Caribbean History|year=1996|volume=30|issue=1/2|page=2|url=http://web.ebscohost.com/ehost/detail?vid=10&amp;hid=107&amp;sid=2784e56a-6ebf-4f20-9439-1158ddf4d76c%40sessionmgr4&amp;bdata=JnNpdGU9ZWhvc3QtbGl2ZQ%3d%3d#db=hia&amp;AN=45526514}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Basdeo|first=Sahadeo|title=Walter Citrine and the British Caribbean Worker's Movement during the Commission Hearing|journal=Journal of Caribbean History|year=1983|volume=18|issue=2|page=46|url=http://web.ebscohost.com/ehost/results?sid=2784e56a-6ebf-4f20-9439-1158ddf4d76c%40sessionmgr4&amp;vid=11&amp;hid=28&amp;bquery=(AU+(basdeo))+AND+(citrine)&amp;bdata=JmRiPWFobCZkYj1oaWEmdHlwZT0xJnNpdGU9ZWhvc3QtbGl2ZQ%3d%3d}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Colonial Development and Welfare Act was passed in 1940 to organize and allocate a sum of £5 million per year to the British West Indies for the purpose of long-term development. Some £10 million in loans was cancelled in the same Act.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Bolland|title=The Politics of Labour in the British Caribbean|page=383}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Colonial Development and Welfare Act of 1945 increased the level of aid to £120m over a twenty-year period. Further Acts followed in 1948, 1959 and 1963, dramatically increasing the scope of monetary assistance, favourable [[interest rate|interest-free]] [[loan]]s and development assistance programs.

===Postwar expansion===
[[Image:Marshall Plan poster.JPG|thumb|A poster promoting the [[Marshall Plan]] in Europe, the first large scale development program. It was designed to boost European economies shattered by [[World War Two|war]] and prevent the growth of [[communism|communist]] influence.]]
The beginning of modern development aid is rooted in the context of Post-[[World War&amp;nbsp;II]] and the [[Cold War]]. Launched as a large-scale aid program by the United States in 1948, the European Recovery Program, or [[Marshall Plan]], was concerned with strengthening the ties to the [[West Europe]]an states to contain the influence of the [[USSR]]. Implemented by the [[Economic Cooperation Administration]] (ECA), the Marshall Plan also expanded its reconstruction finance to strategic parts of the Middle East and Asia.&lt;ref name="Httpwwwusaidgovabout_usaidusaidhisthtml"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.usaid.gov/about_usaid/usaidhist.html |title=USAID: USAID History |publisher=Usaid.gov |date= |accessdate=2011-03-12 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111009131110/http://www.usaid.gov/about_usaid/usaidhist.html |archivedate=2011-10-09 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The rationale was well summarized in the 'Point Four Program', in which United States president [[Harry Truman]] stated the anti-communist rationale for U.S. development aid in his inaugural address of 1949, which also announced the founding of [[NATO]]:&lt;ref name=Kanbur /&gt;

:"In addition, we will provide military advice and equipment to free nations which will cooperate with us in the maintenance of peace and security. Fourth, we must embark on a bold new program for making the benefits of our scientific advances and industrial progress available for the improvement and growth of underdeveloped areas. More than half the people of the world are living in conditions approaching misery. Their food is inadequate. They are victims of disease. Their economic life is primitive and stagnant. Their poverty is a handicap and a threat both to them and to more prosperous areas. For the first time in history, humanity possesses the knowledge and skill to relieve the suffering of these people."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bartleby.com/124/pres53.html Transcript of the speech]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1951, the Technical Cooperation Administration (TCA) was established within the Department of State to run the Point Four program. Development aid was aimed at offering technical solutions to social problems without altering basic [[social structure]]s. The United States was often fiercely opposed to even moderate changes in social structures, for example the [[land reform]] in [[Guatemala]] in the early 1950s.

In 1953 at the end of the [[Korean War]], the incoming [[Eisenhower Administration]] established the Foreign Operations Administration (FOA) as an independent government agency outside the Department of State to consolidate economic and technical assistance. In 1955, foreign aid was brought back under the administrative control of the Department of State and FOA was renamed the International Cooperation Administration (ICA).

In 1956, the Senate conducted a study of foreign aid with the help of a number of independent experts.  The result, stated in a 1959 amendment to the Mutual Security Act, declared that development in low-income regions was a U.S. objective along with and additional to other foreign-policy interests, attempting thus to clarify development assistance's relationship with the effort to contain Communism. In 1961, the Congress approved the [[Foreign Assistance Act]] of 1961 with President [[J.F. Kennedy]]'s support, which retained the 1959 policy of international development as an independent U.S. objective and set up a new Agency for International Development, [[USAID]].

The volume of international aid to [[Developing country|developing countries]] (called "[[Third World]]" at the time) grew dramatically from the 1960s. This aid came mainly from the US and [[Western Europe]]an countries, but there were also significant contributions from the [[Soviet Union]] in exchange for overseas political influence in the context of the heightened global tensions of the [[Cold War]].

The practice of extending aid to politically aligned parties in recipient nations continues today; Faye and Niehaus (2012) are able to establish a causal relationship between politics and aid in recipient nations.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Faye|first=Michael|last2=Niehaus|first2=Paul|date=2012-12-01|title=Political Aid Cycles|url=http://pubs.aeaweb.org/doi/10.1257/aer.102.7.3516|journal=American Economic Review|language=en|volume=102|issue=7|pages=3516–3530|doi=10.1257/aer.102.7.3516|issn=0002-8282}}&lt;/ref&gt; In their analysis of the competitive 2006 Palestinian elections, they note that USAID provided funding for development programs in Palestine to support the Palestinian Authority, the US backed entity running for reelection. Faye and Niehaus discovered that the greater the degree of alignment the recipient party has with the donor entity, the more aid it receives on average during an election year.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; In an analysis of the 3 biggest donor nations (Japan, France, and the US), Alesina and Dollar (2000) discovered that each has its own distortions to the aid it gives out.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Alesina|first=Alberto|last2=Dollar|first2=David|date=2000|title=Who Gives Foreign Aid to Whom and Why?|jstor=40216022|journal=Journal of Economic Growth|volume=5|issue=1|pages=33–63}}&lt;/ref&gt; Japan appears to prioritize giving aid nations that exercise similar voting preferences in the United Nations, France mostly sends aid to its former colonies, and the U.S. disproportionately provides aid to Israel and Egypt.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; These allocations are often powerful tools for maintaining the strategic interests of the donor country in the recipient country.

The [[Development Assistance Committee]] was established in 1960 by the [[OECD|Organisation for European Economic Co-operation]] to coordinate development aid amongst the rich nations. A 1961 resolution decreed that:

{{Development economics sidebar}}
Most [[official development assistance]] (ODA) comes from the 28 members of the [[Development Assistance Committee]] (DAC), or about $135&amp;nbsp;billion in 2013. A further $15.9&amp;nbsp;billion came from the [[European Commission]] and non-DAC countries gave an additional $9.4&amp;nbsp;billion. Although development aid rose in 2013 to the highest level ever recorded, a trend of a falling share of aid going to the neediest sub-Saharan African countries continued.&lt;ref name=OECD-2013 /&gt;

The OECD also lists countries by the amount of ODA they give ''as a percentage of their [[gross national income]].'' The top 10 DAC countries are as follows. Five countries met the longstanding UN target for an ODA/GNI ratio of 0.7% in 2013:&lt;ref name=OECD-2013 /&gt;

==Quality==

[[File:Cartoon, Warren Buffett wants African children to have more Coke - and healthier teeth.gif|thumb|Warren Buffett is considered one of the world's leading philanthropists, yet he is also the biggest investor in Coca-Cola, which aggressively seeks to expand into poorer countries. This cartoon, from an organization critical of the true motives of international aid, calls attention to what it perceives as a contradiction.]]Development aid is often provided by means of supporting local development aid projects. In these projects, it sometimes occurs that no strict code of conduct is in force. In some projects, the development aid workers do not respect the local [[code of conduct]]. For example, the local [[dress code]] as well as [[Human communication|social interaction]]. In developing countries, these matters are regarded highly important and not respecting it may cause severe offense, and thus significant problems and delay of the projects.

There is also much debate about evaluating the quality of development aid, rather than simply the quantity.  For instance, [[tied aid]] is often criticized as the aid given must be spent in the donor country or in a group of selected countries. Tied aid can increase development aid project costs by up to 20 or 30 percent.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.oecd.org/LongAbstract/0,3425,en_2649_33959_29412506_119699_1_1_1,00.html OECD The Typing of Aid]&lt;/ref&gt;

There is also criticism because donors may give with one hand, through large amounts of development aid, yet take away with the other, through strict trade or migration policies, or by getting a foothold for foreign corporations.  The [[Commitment to Development Index]] measures the overall policies of donors and evaluates the quality of their development aid, instead of just comparing the quantity of [[official development assistance]] given.

Still used today, they stand as a failed relic of donor-driven (supply-driven) development aid.]]

Aid effectiveness is the degree to which development aid works, and is a subject of significant disagreement. Dissident economists such as [[Peter Thomas Bauer|Peter Bauer]] and [[Milton Friedman]] argued in the 1960s that aid is ineffective:&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web| title = The sad loss of Lord Bauer| url =http://www.la-articles.org.uk/bauer.htm| accessdate = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Quote | ... an excellent method for transferring money from poor people in rich countries to rich people in poor countries. | Peter Bauer}}

In economics, there are two competing positions on aid. A view pro aid, supported by Jeffrey Sachs and the United Nations, which argues that foreign aid will give the big push to break the low-income poverty trap poorer countries are trapped in. From this perspective, aid serves to finance  “the core inputs to development – teachers, health centers, roads, wells, medicine, to name a few...” (United Nations 2004).&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.annualreviews.org/doi/10.1146/annurev-economics-080614-115553|title=Making Progress on Foreign Aid|last=Qian|first=Nancy|date=2015-08-03|website=dx.doi.org/10.1146/annurev-economics-080614-115553|language=en|doi=10.1146/annurev-economics-080614-115553|access-date=2017-05-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; And a view that is skeptic about the impacts of aid, supported by William Easterly, that points out that aid has not proven to work after 40 years of large investments in Africa.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

American political scientist and professor [[Nicolas van de Walle]] has also argued that despite more than two decades of donor-supported reform in Africa, the continent continues to be plagued by economic crises due to the combination of state generated factors and to the counter productivity of international development aid to Africa. Van de Walle first attributes the failure to implement economic policy reform to factors within the African state:
# Neopatrimonial tendencies of state elites that serve to preserve and centralize power, maintain limited access orders, and create political obstacles to reform.
# Ideological obstacles that have been biased by two decades of failed economic policy reform and in turn, create a hostile environment for reform.
# Low state capacity that reinforces and that in turn, is reinforced by the neopatrimonial tendencies of the state.
Van de Walle later argues that these state generated factors that have obstructed the effective implementation of economic policy reform are further exacerbated by foreign aid. Aid, therefore, makes policy reform less likely, rather than more likely. Van de Walle posits that international aid has sustained economic stagnation in Africa by:
# Pacifying Africa's neopatrimonial tendencies, thereby lessening the incentives for state elites to undertake reform and preserving the status quo.
# Sustaining poorly managed bureaucratic structures and policies that would be otherwise rectified by market forces.
# Allowing state capacities to deteriorate through externalizing many state functions and responsibilities.
In order for aid to be productive and for economic policy reform to be successfully implemented in Africa, the relationship between donors and governments must change. Van de Walle argues that aid must be made more conditional and selective to incentivize states to take on reform and to generate the much needed accountability and capacity in African governments.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Democratic Reform in Africa: The Quality of Progress|last=Van de Walle|first=Nicolas|publisher=Lynne Rienner Publishers, Inc.|year=2004|isbn=1588262464|editor-last=Gyimah-Boadi|editor-first=Emmanuel|location=1800 30th Street, Boulder, Colorado 80301|pages=29–63|chapter=Economic Reform: Patterns and Constraints}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Additionally, information asymmetries often hinder the appropriate allocation of aid; Blum et al. (2016) note that both South Sudan and Liberia struggle tremendously with paying employees and controlling the flow of money - South Sudan had a significant number of ghosts on its payroll, while Liberia's Civil Service Agency could not adequately pay civil servants because there was minimal communication from the Ministries of Health and Education regarding their respective payrolls.&lt;ref&gt;Blum, Jurgen, Fotini Christia, and Daniel Rogger. 2016. “Public Service Reform in Post-Conflict Societies.” World Bank: Fragile and Conflict State Impact Evaluation Research Program paper.
&lt;/ref&gt;

Many [[econometric]] studies in recent years have supported the view that development aid has no effect on the speed with which countries develop. Negative side effects of aid can include an unbalanced [[Currency appreciation and depreciation|appreciation]] of the recipient's currency (known as [[Dutch Disease]]), increasing corruption, and adverse political effects such as postponements of necessary economic and democratic reforms.&lt;ref name="brookings.edu"&gt;[http://www.brookings.edu/opinions/2009/0317_aid_governance_kaufmann.aspx Aid Effectiveness and Governance: The Good, the Bad and the Ugly] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091009071531/http://www.brookings.edu/opinions/2009/0317_aid_governance_kaufmann.aspx |date=2009-10-09 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

It has been argued{{By whom|date=September 2010}} that much government-to-government aid was ineffective because it was merely a way to support strategically important leaders (Alesino and Dollar, 2000). A good example of this is the former dictator of [[Zaire]], [[Mobuto Sese Seko]], who lost support from the West after the Cold War had ended. Mobuto, at the time of his death, had a sufficient personal fortune (particularly in Swiss banks) to pay off the entire external debt of Zaire.&lt;ref name="brookings.edu"/&gt;

Besides some instances that only the president (and/or his close entourage) receives the money resulting from development aid, the money obtained is often badly spent as well. For example, in Chad, the [http://www.esso.com/Chad-English/PA/Files/suppvol1ch1.pdf Chad Export Project], an oil production project supported by the World Bank, was set up. The earnings of this project (6.5 million dollars per year and rising) were used to obtain arms. The government defended this purchase by stating that "development was not possible without safety". However, the [[Military of Chad]] is notorious for severe misconduct against the population (abuse, rape, claiming of supplies and cars) and did not even defend the population in distress (e.g. in the [[War in Darfur|Darfur conflict]]). In 2008, the World Bank retreated from the project that thus increased environmental pollution and human suffering.&lt;ref name="Tsjaad by Dorrit van Dalen"&gt;Tsjaad by Dorrit van Dalen&lt;/ref&gt;

Another criticism has been that Western countries often project their own needs and solutions onto other societies and cultures. In response, western help in some cases has become more 'endogenous', which means that needs as well as solutions are being devised in accordance with local cultures.&lt;ref&gt;[http://commons.globalintegrity.org/2008/12/future-of-anti-corruption-movement.html The Future of The Anti-Corruption Movement], Nathaniel Heller, Global Integrity&lt;/ref&gt; For example, sometimes projects are set up which wish to make several [[ethnic group]]s cooperate. While this is a noble goal, most of these projects fail because of this intent.&lt;ref name="Tsjaad by Dorrit van Dalen"/&gt;

The [https://www.cgdev.org/ Center for Global Development] have published a review&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Moss, Petterson and van de Walle|first=|date=January 2006|title=An Aid-Institutions Paradox? A Review Essay on Aid Dependency and State Building in Sub-Saharan Africa|url=http://www.cgdev.org|journal=Center for Global Development|volume=Working Paper Number 74|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; essay of the existing literature studying the relationship between Aid and public institutions. In this review,  they concluded that a large and sustained Aid can have a negative effect in the development of good public institutions in low income countries. They also mention some of the arguments exhibited in this article as possible mechanism for this negative effect, for instance, they considered the [[Dutch Disease]], the discourage of revenue collections and the effect on the state capacity among others.

Furthermore, the effect of Aid on conflict intensity and onset have been proved to have different impacts in different countries and situations. For instance, for the case of Colombia Dube and Naidu (2015)&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Dube and Naidu|first=|date=January 6, 2015|title=Bases, Bullets, and Ballots: The Effect of US Military Aid on Political Conflict in Colombia|url=https://dx.doi.org/10.1086/679021|journal=The Journal of Politics|volume= 77| issue = 1.|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; showed that Aid from the US seems to have been diverted to paramilitary groups, increasing political violence. Moreover, Nunn and Qian (2014)&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Nunn and Qian|first=|date=June 2014|title=US Food Aid and Civil Conflict|jstor=42920861|journal=American Economic Review|volume=1630-1666|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; have found that an increase in U.S. food aid increases conflict intensity; they claim that the main mechanism driving this result is predation of the aid by the rebel groups. In fact, they note that aid can have the unintentional consequence of actually improving rebel groups' ability to continue conflict, as vehicles and communications equipment usually accompany the aid that is stolen.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; These tools improve the ability of rebel groups to organize and give them assets to trade for arms, possibly increasing the length of the fighting. Finally, Crost, Felter and Johnston (2014)&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Crost, Felter and Johnston|first=|date=June 2014|title=Aid Under Fire: Development Projects and Civil Conflict|url=https://dx.doi.org/10.1257/aer.104.6.1833|journal=American Economic Review|volume=1833–1856|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; have showed that a development program in the Philippines have had the unintended effect of increasing conflict because of an strategic retaliation from the rebel group, on where they tried to prevent that the development program increases support to the government.

It has also been argued that help based on direct donation creates dependency and corruption, and has an adverse effect on local production. As a result, a shift has taken place towards aid based on activation of local assets and stimulation measures such as [[microcredit]].

Aid has also been ineffective in young recipient countries in which ethnic tensions are strong: sometimes ethnic conflicts have prevented efficient delivery of aid.

In some cases, western surpluses that resulted from faulty agriculture- or other policies have been dumped in poor countries, thus wiping out local production and increasing dependency.

In several instances, loans that were considered irretrievable (for instance because funds had been embezzled by a dictator who has already died or disappeared), have been written off by donor countries, who subsequently booked this as development aid.

In many cases, Western governments placed orders with Western companies as a form of subsidizing them, and later shipped these goods to poor countries who often had no use for them. These projects are sometimes called '[[white elephant]]s'.

According to [[James Ferguson (anthropologist)|James Ferguson]], these issues might be caused by deficient diagnostics of the development agencies. In his book [[The Anti-Politics Machine]], Ferguson uses the example of the [[Thaba-Tseka District|Thaba-Tseka]] project in [[Lesotho]] to illustrate how a bad diagnostic on the economic activity of the population and the desire to stay away from local politics, caused a livestock project to fail.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Ferguson|first=James|date=1994|title=The anti-politics machine: 'development' and bureaucratic power in Lesotho|url=http://www.colorado.edu/geography/class_homepages/geog_3682_f08/Articles/Ferguson%20-%20The%20Anti%20Politics%20Machine.pdf|journal=The Ecologist|volume=24 |issue=5|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Martijn Nitzsche, another problem is the way on how development projects are sometimes constructed and how they are maintained by the local population. Often, projects are made with technology that is hard to understand and too difficult to repair, resulting in unavoidable failure over time. Also, in some cases the local population is not very interested in seeing the project to succeed and may revert to disassembling it to retain valuable source materials. Finally, villagers do not always maintain a project as they believe the original development workers or others in the surroundings will repair it when it fails (which is not always so).&lt;ref name="momentum-media.nl"&gt;[http://www.momentum-media.nl/files/_articles/31/Gestrand_Ontwikkelingswerk.pdf Kijk magazine; oktober 2008, Gestrand Ontwikkelingswerk]&lt;/ref&gt;

A common criticism in recent years is that rich countries have put so many conditions on aid that it has reduced aid effectiveness. In the example of [[tied aid]], donor countries often require the recipient to purchase goods and services from the donor, even if these are cheaper elsewhere. Other conditions include opening up the country to foreign investment, even if it might not be ready to do so.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.globalissues.org/TradeRelated/Debt/USAid.asp|title=US and Foreign Aid Assistance|publisher=Global Issues|year=2007|accessdate=2008-02-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Development Aid in Congo Wasted.jpeg|thumb|250px|In [[Democratic Republic of the Congo|Congo]], an abandoned ferry as a relic of a development project is rusting next to the boats people use today.]]
All of these problems have made that a very large part of the spend money on development aid is simply wasted uselessly. According to Gerbert van der Aa, for the Netherlands, only 33% of the development aid is successful, another 33% fails and of the remaining 33% the effect is unclear. This means that for example for the Netherlands, 1.33 to 2.66 billion is lost as it spends 4 billion in total of development aid (or 0,8% of the gross national product).&lt;ref name="momentum-media.nl"/&gt;

For the Italian development aid for instance, we find that one of their successful projects (the Keita project) was constructed at the cost of 2/3 of 1 F-22 fighter jet (100 million $), and was able to reforest {{convert|1876|sqmi|km2|sigfig=2}} of broken, barren earth, hereby increasing the socio-economic wellbeing of the area.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.case.ibimet.cnr.it/keita/data/docs/Viterbo_06.pdf Keita project increasing socio-economic wellbeing] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120311112921/http://www.case.ibimet.cnr.it/keita/data/docs/Viterbo_06.pdf |date=2012-03-11 }}&lt;/ref&gt; However -like the Dutch development aid- again we find that, the Italian development aid too is still not performing up to standards.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.eurodad.org/whatsnew/reports.aspx?id=1514 Italian aid not up to standard overall]&lt;/ref&gt; This makes clear that there are great differences between the success of the projects and that budgetary follow-up may not be so strictly checked by independent third parties.

An excerpt from [[Thomas Dichter]]'s recently published book ''[[Despite Good Intentions]]: Why Development Assistance to the Third World Has Failed'' reads: "This industry has become one in which the benefits of what is spent are increasingly in inverse proportion to the amount spent - a case of more gets you less. As donors are attracted on the basis of appeals emphasizing "product", results, and accountability…the tendency to engage in project-based, direct-action development becomes inevitable. Because funding for development is increasingly finite, this situation is very much a zero-sum game. What gets lost in the shuffle is the far more challenging long-term process of development."

Effectiveness of development aid can be argued to be uncoordinated and unsustainable.  Development aid tends to be put towards specific diseases with high death rates and simple treatments, rather than funding health basics and infrastructure.  Though a lot of NGO's and funding have come forth, little sustainable outcomes have been made.  This is due to the fact that the money doesn't go towards developing a sustainable medical basis.  Money is given to specific diseases to show short-term results, reflecting the donor's best interests rather than the citizens' necessities.  It is evident that many development aid projects are not helping with basic and sustainable health care due to the generally high numbers of deaths due to preventable diseases.  Development aid could do more justice if used to generate general public health with infrastructure and trained personnel rather than pin-pointing specific diseases and reaching for quick fixes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Garrett|first=Laurie|title=The Challenge of Global Health|journal=Foreign Affairs|year=2007|volume=86|issue=1|pages=14–38}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Research has shown that developed nations are more likely to give aid to nations who have the worst economic situations and policies (Burnside, C., Dollar, D., 2000). They give money to these nations so that they can become developed and begin to turn these policies around. It has also been found that aid relates to the population of a nation as well, and that the smaller a nation is, the more likely it is to receive funds from donor agencies. The harsh reality of this is that it is very unlikely that a developing nation with a lack of resources, policies, and good governance will be able to utilize incoming aid money in order to get on their feet and begin to turn the damaged economy around. It is more likely that a nation with good economic policies and good governance will be able to utilize aid money to help the country establish itself with an existing foundation and be able to rise from there with the help of the international community. But research shows that it is the low-income nations that will receive aid more so, and the better off a nation is, the less aid money it will be granted. On the other hand, Alesina and Dollar (2000) note that private foreign investment often responds positively to more substantive economic policy and better protections under the law.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; There is increased private foreign investment in developing nations with these attributes, especially in the higher income ones, perhaps due to being larger and possibly more profitable markets.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

=== MIT based study ===
[[File:DBP 1981 1103 Entwicklungszusammenarbeit.jpg|thumb|250px|Development aid, German stamp (1981).]]

The [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology]]'s Abhijit Banerjee and Ruimin He have undertaken a rigorous study of the relatively few independent evaluations of aid program successes and failures.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.econ.nyu.edu/cvstarr/conferences/ForeignAid/papers/Banerjee.pdf|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080410233354/http://www.econ.nyu.edu/cvstarr/conferences/ForeignAid/papers/Banerjee.pdf|archivedate=2008-04-10|format=PDF|title=Making aid work|year=2003|accessdate=2008-02-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; They suggest the following interventions are usually highly effective forms of aid in normal circumstances:
* subsidies given directly to families to be spent on children's education and health
* education vouchers for school uniforms and textbooks
* teaching selected illiterate adults to read and write
* deworming drugs and vitamin/nutritional supplements
* vaccination and [[HIV]]/[[AIDS]] prevention programs
* indoor sprays against [[malaria]], anti-[[mosquito]] bed netting
* suitable fertilizers
* clean [[water supply|water supplies]]

=== UK Parliamentary study ===

An inquiry into aid effectiveness by the UK All Party Parliamentary Group (APPG) for Debt, Aid and Trade featured evidence from Rosalind Eyben, a Fellow at the [[Institute of Development Studies]]. Her evidence to the inquiry stated that effective aid requires as much investing in relationships as in managing money. It suggests Development organisations need to change the way they work to manage better the multiple partnerships that the Accra Agenda for Action recognises is at the core of the aid business. In relation to this specific inquiry, Dr Eyben outlined the following points:&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ids.ac.uk/go/news/putting-relationships-first-for-aid-effectiveness 'Putting Relationships First for Aid Effectiveness'] Evidence Submission to the APPG Inquiry on Aid Effectiveness, Institute of Development Studies (IDS)&lt;/ref&gt;

*Achieving impact requires investing in relationships, development organisations need to support their staff to do this. At the moment, the opposite is happening.
*In multiple sets of relationships there will be different ideas about what is success and how to achieve it and this should be reflected in methodologies for defining and assessing the impact of aid.
*Helpful procedural harmonisation should not mean assuming there is only a single diagnosis and solution to any complex problem.
*In addition to measuring results, donors need to assess the quality of relations at project/programme, country and international levels against indicators agreed with partners.
*Decisions on aid need to be made on a case by case basis on the advice of well-informed country offices.
*Accountable states depend on empowered citizens
*Development organisations also need to be more accountable to UK citizens through encouraging conversations as to the real challenges and limitations of aid. (Point made in relation to UK as evidence for UK parliamentary inquiry)

The views above are of Eyben. There were many other submissions to the All Party Parliamentary Group for Debt, Aid and Trade's inquiry into Aid Effectiveness. The final report gathered a vast amount of information from a wide range of sources to ensure a balanced perspective on the issues of aid effectiveness. The All Party Parliamentary Group for Debt, Aid and Trade's inquiry into Aid Effectiveness can be found online and the submissions of other contributors are available upon request.

===Effect on the Recipient Country's Development===

Albert Hirschman’s Exit-Voice-Loyalty model can be used to understand how certain policy changes affect the growth of a nation and the change of bargaining power inside it. Clark et al.’s formalization of the model to politics shows the effect that developmental aid can have on the receiving country’s development and highlights that the aid can potentially harm that country.

[[Albert O. Hirschman]]’s EVL model is based on the foundation that “under any economic, social, or political system, individuals, business firms, and organizations, in general, are subject to lapses from efficient, rational, law-abiding, virtuous, or otherwise functional behavior” [[Exit, Voice, and Loyalty]]. The customer who is affected by the lapse in the system (a fall in the quality of a product they are consuming) has two ways to answer to this- “exit” or “voice”. If the individual in a chooses the former, they simply stop buying the product and inflict a revenue drop that forces the firm to either correct their mistake or cease to exist. If the individual chooses the “voice” option, then they will express their dissatisfaction to either the firm or something that has authority over it. This will force the firm to fix their lapse, but it will not suffer a decline in revenue. Lastly, Hirschman introduces the “loyalty” option, which occurs when the consumer cannot “exit” and the firm does not care about the effect that “voice” will have on their revenue, and the consumers who chose it continues to consume the lapsed good.

Clark et al.’s paper takes Hirschman’s Exit-Voice-Loyalty model [https://projects.iq.harvard.edu/files/pegroup/files/clark_golder.pdf] and applies it to political developments inside a nation. When a government changes a policy that now has a negative effect on the welfare of some citizens, or is already being unresponsive to a deleterious situation, the citizens have the same 3 choices of response as before. Here, “exit” can take the form of citizens leaving the country [[The Art of Not Being Governed]] and hence depriving the state of their taxes or simply rearranging their capital and goods so they are not taxed by the government, as seen with British merchants threatening to move capital to the Netherlands if not given representation after the [[Glorious Revolution]]. “Voice” takes the form of non-violent civil disobedience, as seen with Gandhi's [[Salt March]] and the [[Black Lives Matter]] protests in Ferguson, a violent demonstration, as seen with [[Luddite]] breaking weaving machinery to protest the lack of protectionist policies by the English government, or even “everyday resistance” [http://abahlali.org/files/Scotts-Weapons.pdf] where small, non-cooperation and false create high costs for the state. “Loyalty” entails that the citizens simply accept the situation and continue their lives before.

How foreign aid enters this equation in weak states is by changing the citizens’ power of “voice” and “exit” and weakening the state’s dependence on their citizens and hence becoming less responsive to their needs. If the state receives international aid, it is less dependent on the tax revenue that it collects from its constituents. A higher level of fiscal independence on the part of the state decreases the bargaining power of the citizens. The government is threatened less by the citizens’ “exit” option, and less hurt if it is implemented, hence this takes away a credible threat to use at the negotiation table in order for the citizens to request improvement to their current condition. At the same time, the lack of dependence for revenue decreases the “voice” action of the citizen by weakening the effect a violent demonstration or everyday resistance has on impacting the state’s decision-making.

As long as the government of a nation receiving international aid knows that it will keep receiving it, and there will be no repercussion on the side of the donors for failing to address its constituents’ issues, it stays optimal for that government to keep ignoring the weakened demands of its citizens. With weakened bargaining power and a less responsive state, there can be no bargaining between citizen and state that will, in the long, run lead to economic and/or development within the nation. Although international has done far-reaching things with respect to increasing access to improved medical care, improving education, and decreasing poverty and hunger,  only in 1997 did the [[World Bank]] began to rethink its aid policy structure and begin using parts of it specifically for building up the state capability of the aid-receiving nations [https://openknowledge.worldbank.org/handle/10986/5980]. Even more recently, the [[Millennium Challenge Corporation]], a US-based aid agency, started working with developing nation to provide them with strictly development aid as they set and implement goals for national development.

==Corruption==
{{Main|Political corruption|Aid#Support of corrupt state structures}}
While development aid is an important source of investment for poor and often insecure societies, aid's complexity and the ever-expanding budgets leave it vulnerable to corruption, yet discussing it remains difficult as for many it is a taboo subject.&lt;ref name=ODI2&gt;Sarah Bailey (2008) [http://www.odi.org.uk/resources/details.asp?id=2385&amp;title=corruption-risks-perceptions-prevention-humanitarian-assistance Need and greed: corruption risks, perceptions and prevention in humanitarian assistance] [[Overseas Development Institute]]&lt;/ref&gt; Corruption is very hard to quantify as it is often hard to differentiate it from other problems, such as wastage, mismanagement and inefficiency, to illustrate the point, over $8.75&amp;nbsp;billion was lost to waste, fraud, abuse and mismanagement in the [[Hurricane Katrina]] relief effort.&lt;ref name=ODI2/&gt;

Often a lack of understanding of the process by those meant to be receiving aid leads to cynicism and belief that greed and corruption are the key failures. [[Non-governmental organizations]] have in recent years made great efforts to increase participation, accountability and transparency, humanitarian assistance remains a poorly understood process to those meant to be receiving it—much greater investment needs to be made into researching and investing in relevant and effective accountability systems.&lt;ref name=ODI2/&gt;

However, there is little clear consensus on the trade-offs between speed and control, especially in emergency situations when the humanitarian imperative of saving lives and alleviating suffering may conflict with the time and resources required to minimise corruption risks.&lt;ref name=ODI2/&gt; Researchers at the [[Overseas Development Institute]] have highlighted the need to tackle corruption with, but not limited to, the following methods:&lt;ref name=ODI2/&gt;
# Resist the pressure to spend aid rapidly.
# Continue to invest in audit capacity, beyond simple paper trails;
# Establish and verify the effectiveness of complaints mechanisms, paying close attention to local power structures, security and cultural factors hindering complaints;
# Clearly explain the processes during the targeting and registration stages, highlighting points such as the fact that people should not make payments to be included, photocopy and read aloud any lists prepared by leaders or committees.

== Types of Aid ==

===Private Aid===
[[Development charities]] make up a vast web of [[non-governmental organization]]s, religious ministries, foundations, business donations and college scholarships devoted to development aid. Estimates vary, but private aid is at least as large as ODA within the United States, at $16 billion in 2003. World figures for private aid are not well tracked, so cross-country comparisons are not easily possible, though it does seem that per person, some other countries may give more, or have similar incentives that the United States has for its citizens to encourage giving.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.globalissues.org/TradeRelated/Debt/USAid.asp#Sidenoteonprivatecontributions|title=Ranking The Rich Based On Commitment To Development|publisher=globalissues.org|accessdate=2008-03-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Aid for Gender Equality ===
Starting at the beginning of the UN Decade for Women in 1975, the [[Women in development|Women in Development]] approach to international development began to inform the provision of development aid.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Charlesworth|first=Hillary|date=|title=Not Waving But Drowning Gender Mainstreaming and Human Rights in the United nations|url=|journal=Harvard Human Rights Journal|volume=18|pages=2|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some academics criticized the [[Women in development|Women in Development]] approach for relying on integrating women into existing development aid paradigms instead of promulgating specific aid to encourage gender equality.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; The [[Gender and development|Gender and Development]] approach was created in response, to discuss international development in terms of societal gender roles and to challenge these gender roles within development policy.&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Debusscher|first=Petra|date=|title=Gender Mainstreaming in European Union Development Policy Towards Latin America: Transforming Gender Relations or Confirming Hierarchies?|url=|journal=Latin American Perspectives|volume=39|pages=182|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Women in Development predominated as the approach to gender in development aid through the 1980s.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Jones|first=Robert|last2=Swiss|first2=Liam|date=September 2014|title=Gendered Leadership: The Effects of Female Development Agency Leaders on Foreign Aid Spending|url=|journal=Sociological Forum|volume=29|issue=3|pages=574|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Starting in the early 1990s Gender and Development’s influence encouraged [[Gender mainstreaming|Gender Mainstreaming]] within international development aid.&lt;ref&gt;Swain, Ranjula Bali and Garikipati, Supriya. 2016.

The [[World Conference on Women, 1995]] promulgated Gender Mainstreaming on all policy levels for the [[United Nations]].&lt;ref&gt;Charlesworth, Hilary. "Not Waving But Drowing Gender Mainstreaming and Human Rights in the United Nations". ''Harvard Human Rights Journal''. 18: 3.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.un.org/esa/gopher-data/conf/fwcw/off/a--20.en|title=Report of the Fourth World Conference on Women|last=|first=|date=|website=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Gender Mainstreaming has been adopted by nearly all units of the UN with the UN Economic and Social Council adopting a definition which indicated an “ultimate goal… to achieve gender equality.”&lt;ref&gt;Charlesworth, Hillary. "Not Waving But Drowning Gender Mainstreaming and Human Rights in the United nations". ''Harvard Human Rights Journal''. 18: 4-5.&lt;/ref&gt; The UN included  promoting gender equality and empowering women as one of eight [[Millennium Development Goals]] for developing countries.

The EU integrated Women and Development thinking into its aid policy starting with the Lomé Convention in 1984.&lt;ref name=":15"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Debusscher|first=Petra|last2=Hulse|first2=Merran|date=|title=Including Women's Voices? Gender Mainstreaming in EU and SADC Development Strategies for Southern Africa|url=|journal=Journal of Southern African Studies|volume=40|issue=3|pages=561–562|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1992 the EU’s Latin American and Asian development policy first clearly said that development programs should not have detrimental effects on the position and role of women.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Debusscher|first=Petra|date=|title=Gender Mainstreaming in European Union Development Policy Towards Latin America: Transforming Gender Relations or Confirming Hierarchies?|url=|journal=Latin American Perspectives|volume=39|pages=181|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since then the EU has continued the policy of including gender equality within development aid and programs.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; Within the EU gender equality is increasingly introduced in programmatic ways.&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Debusscher|first=Petra|date=|title=Gender Mainstreaming in European Union Development Policy Towards Latin America: Transforming Gender Relations or Confirming Hierarchies?|url=|journal=Latin American Perspectives|volume=39|pages=187–189|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The bulk of the EU’s aid for gender equality seeks to increase women’s access to education, employment and reproductive health services. However, some areas of gender inequality are targeted according to region, such as land reform and counteracting the effects of gangs on women in Latin America.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;

[[United States Agency for International Development|USAID]] first established a Woman in Development office in 1974 and in 1996 promulgated the Gender Plan of Action to further integrate gender equality into aid programs.&lt;ref name=":7"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.usaid.gov/sites/default/files/documents/1865/GenderEqualityPolicy_0.pdf|title=Gender Equality and Female Empowerment Policy|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=USAID|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2012 USAID released a Gender Equality and Female Empowerment Policy to guide its aid programs in making gender equality a central goal.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt; USAID saw increased solicitations from aid programs which integrated gender equality from 1995-2010.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt; As part of their increased aid provision, USAID developed PROMOTE to target gender inequality in Afghanistan with $216 million in aid coming directly from USAID and $200 million coming from other donors.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.usaid.gov/afghanistan/promote/|title=Promote|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=USAID|access-date=2017-05-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many NGOs have also incorporated gender equality into their programs. Within the Netherlands, NGOs including Oxfam Netherlands Organization for Development Assistance, the Humanist Institute for Cooperation with Developing Countries, Interchurch Organization for Development Cooperation, and Catholic Organization for Relief and Development Aid have included certain targets for their aid programs with regards to gender equality.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Van Eerdewijk|first=Anouka|date=|title=The Micropolitics of Evaporation: Gender Mainstreaming Instruments in Practice|url=|journal=Journal of International Development|volume=26|pages=348–349|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; NGOs which receive aid dollars through the [[Ministry of Foreign Affairs (Norway)|Norwegian Ministry of Foreign Affairs]] or which partner with the Norwegian government on aid projects must “demonstrate that they take women and gender equality seriously.”&lt;ref name=":8"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Østebo|first=Marit|last2=Haukanes|first2=Haldis|last3=Blystad|first3=Astrid|date=|title=Strong State Policies on Gender and Aid: Threats and Opportunities for Norwegian Faith-Based Organisations|url=|journal=Forum for Development Studies|volume=40|issue=2|pages=194|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In response to this requirement organizations like the Norwegian Christian charity Digni have initiated projects which target gender equality.&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt;

[[Private foundation|Private Foundations]] provide the majority of their gender related aid to health programs and have relatively neglected other areas of gender inequality.&lt;ref name=":9"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/931344632|title=Non-traditional aid and gender equity evidence from million dollar donations|last=Okonkwo|first=Osili, Una|date=2013|publisher=WIDER|year=|isbn=9789292306533|location=|pages=4–5|oclc=931344632}}&lt;/ref&gt; Foundations, such as the [[Bill &amp; Melinda Gates Foundation|Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation]], have partnered with governmental aid organizations to provide funds for gender equality, but increasingly aid is provided through partnerships with local organizations and NGOS.&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt; Corporations also participate in providing gender equality aid through their [[Corporate social responsibility|Corporate Social Responsibility]] programs. [[Nike, Inc.|Nike]] helped to create the [[Girl Effect]] to provide aid programs targeted towards adolescent girls.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/931344632|title=Non-traditional aid and gender equity evidence from million dollar donations|last=Okonkwo|first=Osili, Una|date=2013|publisher=WIDER|year=|isbn=9789292306533|location=|pages=6|oclc=931344632}}&lt;/ref&gt; Using publicly available data Una Osili an economist at the [[Indiana University – Purdue University Indianapolis|Indiana University-Purdue University Indianapolis]] found that between 2000-10 $1.15 billion in private aid grants over $1 million from the United States targeted gender equality.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/931344632|title=Non-traditional aid and gender equity evidence from million dollar donations|last=Okonkwo|first=Osili, Una|date=2013|publisher=WIDER|year=|isbn=9789292306533|location=|pages=8|oclc=931344632}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development|Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development]] provides detailed analysis of the extent of aid for gender equality. OECD member countries tag their aid programs with gender markers when a program is designed to advanced gender equality.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/931344632|title=Non-traditional aid and gender equity evidence from million dollar donations|last=Okonkwo|first=Osili, Una|date=2013|publisher=WIDER|year=|isbn=9789292306533|location=|pages=3|oclc=931344632}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2014 OECD member nations committed almost $37 billion to aid for gender equality, with over $7 billion of that committed to programs where gender equality is a principal programmatic goal.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.oecd.org/dac/stats/gender-related-aid-data.htm|title=Gender-related aid data at a glance|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=OECD|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Effectiveness ====
Three main measures of gender inequality are used in calculating gender equality and testing programs for the purposes of development aid. In the 1995 Human Development Report the [[United Nations Development Programme|United Nations Development Program]] introduced the [[Gender Development Index]] and [[Gender Empowerment Measure]].&lt;ref name=":10"&gt;Swain, Ranjula Bali and Garikipati, Supriya. 2016. Does Foreign Aid Improve Gender Performance of Recipient Countries? Results from Structural Equation Analysis. Paper presented at 25th IAFFE Annual Conference, Galway, Ireland. 7. Abstract retrieved from https://editorialexpress.com/cgi-bin/conference/download.cgi?db_name=IAFFE2016&amp;paper_id=66&amp;file_type=slides.&lt;/ref&gt; The Gender Empowerment Measure is calculated based on three measures, proportion of women in national parliaments, percentage of women in economic decision making positions and female share of income. The Gender Development Index uses the Human Development Index and corrects its results in life expectancy, income, and education for gender imbalances.&lt;ref name=":10" /&gt; Due to criticisms of these two indexes the United Nations Development Program in its 2010 Human Development Report introduced the [[Gender Inequality Index]]. The Gender Inequality Index uses more metrics and attempts to show the losses from gender inequality.&lt;ref name=":10" /&gt;

Even with these indexes, Ranjula Swain of the [[Stockholm School of Economics]] and Supriya Garikipati of the [[University of Liverpool]] found that, compared to the effectiveness of health, economic, and education targeted aid, foreign aid for gender equality remains understudied.&lt;ref&gt;Swain, Ranjula Bali and Garikipati, Supriya. 2016. Does Foreign Aid Improve Gender Performance of Recipient Countries? Results from Structural Equation Analysis. Paper presented at 25th IAFFE Annual Conference, Galway, Ireland. 5. Abstract retrieved from https://editorialexpress.com/cgi-bin/conference/download.cgi?db_name=IAFFE2016&amp;paper_id=66&amp;file_type=slides.&lt;/ref&gt; Swain and Garikipati found in an analysis of Gender Equality Aid that on a country and region-wide level gender equality aid was not significant in its effect. Swain and Garikipati blame this on the relative lack of aid with gender equality as a primary motivation.&lt;ref name=":11"&gt;Swain, Ranjula Bali and Garikipati, Supriya. 2016. Does Foreign Aid Improve Gender Performance of Recipient Countries? Results from Structural Equation Analysis. Paper presented at 25th IAFFE Annual Conference, Galway, Ireland. 12-13.

In 2005, the Interagency Gender Working Group and [[World Health Organization]] released the “So What? Report” on the effectiveness of Gender Mainstreaming in NGO reproductive health programs. The report found these programs effective, but had trouble finding clear gender outcomes because most programs did not measure this data.&lt;ref name=":12"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.who.int/gender-equity-rights/knowledge/so-what-report.pdf|title=A Summary of the "So What?" Report|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=WHO|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; When gender outcomes were measured, the report found positive programmatic effects, but the report did not look at whether these results were from increased access to services or increasing gender equality.&lt;ref name=":12" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":13"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Ravindran|first=TKS|last2=Kelkar-Khambete|first2=A.|date=|title=Gender Mainstreaming in Health: Looking Back, Looking Forward|url=|journal=Global Public Health|volume=3|pages=127–129|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Even when gender equality is identified as a goal of aid, other factors will often be the primary focus of the aid.&lt;ref name=":11" /&gt; In some instances the nature of aid’s gender equality component can fail to be implemented at the level of individual projects when it is a secondary aspect of a project.&lt;ref&gt;Charlesworth, Hilary. "Not Waving But Drowing Gender Mainstreaming and Human Rights in the United Nations". ''Harvard Human Rights Journal''. 18: 12.&lt;/ref&gt; Gender equality is often put forward as a policy goal for the organization but program staff have differing commitment and training with regards to this goal.&lt;ref name=":14"&gt;Van Eerdewijk, Anouka. "The Micropolitics of Evaporation: Gender Mainstreaming Instruments in Practice". Journal of International Development. 26: 353.&lt;/ref&gt; When gender equality is a secondary aspect, development aid which has funds required to impact gender equality can be used to meet quotas of women receiving aid, without effecting the changes in gender roles that Gender Mainstreaming was meant to promote.&lt;ref name=":14" /&gt; Programs can also fail to provide lasting effects, with local organizations removing gender equality aspects of programs after international aid dollars are no longer funding them.&lt;ref name=":13" /&gt;

Robert C. Jones of [[McGill University]] and Liam Swiss of [[Memorial University of Newfoundland|Memorial University]] argue that women leaders of governmental aid organizations and NGOs are more effective at Gender Mainstreaming than their male counterparts.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Smith|first=Robert|last2=Swiss|first2=Liam|date=|title=Gendered Leadership: The Effects of Female Development Agency Leaders on Foreign Aid Spending|url=|journal=Sociological Forum|volume=29|issue=3|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; They found in a literature review that NGOs headed by women were more likely to have Gender Mainstreaming programs and that women were often the heads of Gender Mainstreaming programs within organizations.&lt;ref&gt;Jones, Robert; Swiss, Liam (September 2014). "Gendered Leadership: The Effects of Female Development Agency Leaders on Foreign Aid Spending". ''Sociological Forum''. '''29''' (3): 578.&lt;/ref&gt; By breaking down gender equality programs into two categories, gender mainstreamed programs and gender-focused programs which do not mainstream gender, Jones and Swiss found that female leaders of governmental aid organizations provided more financial support to gender mainstreamed programs and slightly more support to gender aware programs overall.&lt;ref&gt;Jones, Robert; Swiss, Liam (September 2014).

Petra Debusscher of [[Ghent University]] has criticized EU aid agencies for following an “integrationist approach” to gender mainstreaming, where gender mainstreaming is used to achieve existing policy goals, as opposed to a “transformative approach” which seeks to change policy priorities and programs fundamentally to achieve gender equality.&lt;ref name=":15" /&gt; She finds that this approach more closely follows a Women in Development model than a Gender and Development one. Debussher criticized the EU’s development policy in Latin America for focusing too much attention on gender inequality as a problem to be solved for women.&lt;ref name=":16"&gt;Debusscher, Petra. "Gender Mainstreaming in European Union Development Policy Towards Latin America: Transforming Gender Relations or Confirming Hierarchies?". ''Latin American Perspectives''. '''39''': 190.&lt;/ref&gt; She found that the language used represented more of a Woman in Development approach than a Gender and Development Approach.&lt;ref&gt;Debusscher, Petra. "Gender Mainstreaming in European Union Development Policy Towards Latin America: Transforming Gender Relations or Confirming Hierarchies?". ''Latin American Perspectives''. '''39''': 192-194.&lt;/ref&gt; She notes that men’s role in domestic violence is insufficiently brought forward, with program and policy instead targeting removing women from victimhood.&lt;ref name=":16" /&gt; Rather than discussing the role of men and women relative to each other, women are discussed as needing to “catch up with an implicit male norm.”&lt;ref name=":16" /&gt; Debussher also criticized EU’s development aid to [[Southern Africa]] as too narrow in its scope and too reliant on integrating women and gender into existing aid paradigms.&lt;ref name=":17"&gt;Debusscher, Petra; Hulse, Merran. "Including Women's Voices? Gender Mainstreaming in EU and SADC Development Strategies for Southern Africa". ''Journal of Southern African Studies''. '''40''' (3): 571-572.&lt;/ref&gt; Debusscher notes that women’s organizations in the region are often concerned with different social constructions of gender, as opposed to the economic growth structure favored by the EU.&lt;ref&gt;Debusscher, Petra; Hulse, Merran. "Including Women's Voices? Gender Mainstreaming in EU and SADC Development Strategies for Southern Africa". ''Journal of Southern African Studies''. '''40''' (3): 566-567.&lt;/ref&gt; For EU development aid to Europe and surrounding countries, Debsusscher argued that programs to encourage education of women were designed primarily to encourage overall economic growth, not to target familial and social inequalities.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Debusscher|first=Petra|date=2012-10-01|title=Mainstreaming Gender in European Union Development Policy in the European Neighborhood|url=https://dx.doi.org/10.1080/1554477X.2012.722427|journal=Journal of Women, Politics &amp; Policy|volume=33|issue=4|pages=333|doi=10.1080/1554477X.2012.722427|issn=1554-477X|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some criticism of gender equality development aid discusses a lack of voices of women’s organizations in developing aid programs. Debusscher argued that feminist and women’s organizations were not represented enough in EU aid.&lt;ref&gt;Debusscher, Petra. "Gender Mainstreaming in European Union Development Policy Towards Latin America: Transforming Gender Relations or Confirming Hierarchies?". ''Latin American Perspectives''. '''39''': 191-192.
&lt;/ref&gt; and that while feminist and women’s organizations were represented in implementing policy programs they were not sufficiently involved in their development in EU aid to [[Southern Africa]].&lt;ref name=":17" /&gt; Similarly, Jones and Swiss argue that more women need to be in leadership positions of aid organizations and that these organizations need to be “demasculinized” in order to better gender mainstream.&lt;ref&gt;Jones, Robert; Swiss, Liam (September 2014). "Gendered Leadership: The Effects of Female Development Agency Leaders on Foreign Aid Spending". ''Sociological Forum''. '''29''' (3): 583-584.&lt;/ref&gt; T.K.S. Ravindran and A. Kelkar-Khambete criticized the Millennium Development Goals for insufficiently integrating gender into all development goals, instead creating its own development goal, as limiting the level of aid provided to promote gender equality.&lt;ref&gt;Ravindran, TKS; Kelkar-Khambete, A. "Gender Mainstreaming in Health: Looking Back, Looking Forward". ''Global Public Health''. '''3''': 139.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Remittances==
It is doubtful whether [[remittances]], money sent home by foreign workers, ought to be considered a form of development aid. However, they appear to constitute a large proportion of the flows of money between developed and developing countries, although the exact amounts are uncertain because remittances are poorly tracked. [[World Bank]] estimates for remittance flows to developing countries in 2004 totalled $122&amp;nbsp;billion; however, this number is expected to change upwards in the next few years as the formulas used to calculate remittance flows are modified. The exact nature and effects of remittance money remain contested,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.imf.org/external/pubs/ft/wp/2003/wp03189.pdf Are Immigrant Remittance Flows a Source of Capital for Development? - WP/03/189&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; however in at least 36 of the 153 countries tracked remittance sums were second only to FDI and outnumbered both public and private aid donations.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.imf.org/external/np/pp/eng/2005/021705.pdf Approaches to a Regulatory Framework for Formal and Informal Remittance Systems: Experiences and Lessons, February 17, 2005&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[International Monetary Fund]] has reported that private remittances may have a negative impact on economic growth, as they are often used for private consumption of individuals and families, not for economic development of the region or country.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.imf.org/external/pubs/cat/longres.cfm?sk=16801.0 Are Immigrant Remittance Flows a Source of Capital for Development&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="14585">In [[functional analysis]], the '''dual norm''' is a measure of the "size" of each [[continuous function|continuous]] [[linear functional]] defined on a [[normed space]].

== Definition ==

Let &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; be a [[normed vector space]]  with norm &lt;math&gt; |\cdot | &lt;/math&gt; and let &lt;math&gt; X^*&lt;/math&gt;  
be the [[dual space]]. The '''dual norm''' of a continuous [[linear functional]] &lt;math&gt; f &lt;/math&gt; belonging to &lt;math&gt; X^*&lt;/math&gt; is defined to be the real number

: &lt;math&gt; \left\| f \right\| := \sup\{ \left| f(x) \right| : x \in X, \left| x \right| \leq 1\}&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt; sup &lt;/math&gt; denotes the [[supremum]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Rudin|1991|loc= p. 87}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The map &lt;math&gt; f \mapsto \|f\| &lt;/math&gt; defines a [[normed vector space|norm]] on &lt;math&gt; X^* &lt;/math&gt;.  (See Theorems 1 and 2 below.)

The dual norm is a special case of the [[operator norm]] defined for each (bounded) linear map between normed vector spaces.

The topology on &lt;math&gt;X^*&lt;/math&gt; [[normed vector space#Topological structure|induced by]] &lt;math&gt; |\cdot |&lt;/math&gt; 
turns out to be as strong as the [[Weak topology#The weak-.2A topology|weak-* topology]] on &lt;math&gt; X^*&lt;/math&gt;.

If &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; is [[complete metric space|complete]] 
(i.e. a [[Banach space]]) then &lt;math&gt;X^*&lt;/math&gt; is also complete.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Rudin|1991|loc= p. 88}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== The double dual of a normed linear space ==

The [[double dual]] (or second dual) &lt;math&gt;X^{**}&lt;/math&gt; of &lt;math&gt; X &lt;/math&gt; is the dual of the normed vector space &lt;math&gt; X^* &lt;/math&gt;.
There is a natural  map &lt;math&gt; \varphi: X \to X^{**} &lt;/math&gt;.
Indeed, for each &lt;math&gt; w^*&lt;/math&gt; in &lt;math&gt; X^*&lt;/math&gt; define

: &lt;math&gt; \varphi(v)(w^*): = w^*(v). &lt;/math&gt;

The map &lt;math&gt; \varphi &lt;/math&gt;
is [[linear map|linear]], [[injective]], and [[Isometry|distance preserving]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Rudin|1991|loc=section 4.5, p. 95}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
In particular, if &lt;math&gt; X &lt;/math&gt; is complete (i.e. a Banach space), then &lt;math&gt; \varphi &lt;/math&gt; is an isometry onto a closed 
subspace of &lt;math&gt; X^{**} &lt;/math&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Rudin|1991|loc=p. 95}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In general, the map &lt;math&gt; \varphi &lt;/math&gt; is not surjective. For example, if &lt;math&gt; X&lt;/math&gt; is the Banach space &lt;math&gt; L^{\infty}&lt;/math&gt; 
consisting of bounded functions on the real line with the supremum norm, then the map &lt;math&gt; \varphi &lt;/math&gt; is not surjective. 
(See [[Lp spaces|&lt;math&gt; L^p &lt;/math&gt; space]]). 
If &lt;math&gt; \varphi &lt;/math&gt; is surjective, then &lt;math&gt; \varphi &lt;/math&gt; is said to be a [[reflexive Banach space]].
If &lt;math&gt; 1 &lt; p &lt; \infty &lt;/math&gt;, then the  [[Lp spaces|space &lt;math&gt; L^p &lt;/math&gt;]] is a reflexive Banach space.

== Mathematical Optimization ==
Let &lt;math&gt;||\cdot||&lt;/math&gt; be a norm on &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{R}^{n}&lt;/math&gt;. The associated ''dual norm'', denoted &lt;math&gt;\| \cdot \|_*&lt;/math&gt;, is defined as

:&lt;math&gt;||z||_* = \sup\{z^\intercal x\; |\; ||x|| \leq 1 \}.&lt;/math&gt;

(This can be shown to be a norm.) The dual norm can be interpreted as the [[operator norm]] of &lt;math&gt;z^\intercal&lt;/math&gt;, interpreted as a &lt;math&gt;1 \times n&lt;/math&gt; matrix, with the norm &lt;math&gt;|| \cdot ||&lt;/math&gt; on &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{R}^n&lt;/math&gt;, and the absolute value on &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{R}&lt;/math&gt;:

:&lt;math&gt;||z||_* = \sup\{|z^\intercal x|\; |\; ||x|| \leq 1 \}.&lt;/math&gt;

From the definition of dual norm we have the inequality

:&lt;math&gt; z^\intercal x = || x || (z^\intercal \frac{x}{|| x ||} ) \leq \lVert x \rVert \lVert z \rVert_*&lt;/math&gt;

which holds for all {{mvar|x}} and {{mvar|z}}.&lt;ref&gt;This inequality is tight, in the following sense: for any {{mvar|x}} there is a {{mvar|z}} for which the inequality holds with equality. (Similarly, for any {{mvar|z}} there is an {{mvar|x}} that gives equality.)&lt;/ref&gt; The dual of the dual norm is the original norm: we have &lt;math&gt; \lVert x \rVert_{**} = \lVert x \rVert&lt;/math&gt; for all {{mvar|x}}. (This need not hold in infinite-dimensional vector spaces.)

The dual of the [[Norm (mathematics)#Euclidean norm|Euclidean norm]] is the Euclidean norm, since

:&lt;math&gt; \sup\{z^\intercal x\; |\; \lVert x \rVert_2 \leq 1 \} = \lVert z \rVert_2.&lt;/math&gt;

(This follows from the [[Cauchy–Schwarz inequality]]; for nonzero {{mvar|z}}, the value of {{mvar|x}} that maximises &lt;math&gt;z^\intercal x&lt;/math&gt; over &lt;math&gt;\lVert x \rVert_2 \leq 1&lt;/math&gt; is &lt;math&gt;\frac{z}{\lVert z \rVert_2}&lt;/math&gt;.)

The dual of the &lt;math&gt;\ell_1&lt;/math&gt;-norm is the &lt;math&gt;\ell_\infty&lt;/math&gt;-norm:
:&lt;math&gt; \sup\{z^\intercal x\; |\; \lVert x \rVert_\infty \leq 1\} = \sum_{i=1}^n |z_i| = \lVert z \rVert_1,&lt;/math&gt;

and the dual of the &lt;math&gt;\ell_\infty&lt;/math&gt;-norm is the &lt;math&gt;\ell_1&lt;/math&gt;-norm.

More generally, [[Hölder's inequality]] shows that the dual of the [[Lp spaces|&lt;math&gt;\ell_p&lt;/math&gt;-norm]] is the &lt;math&gt;\ell_q&lt;/math&gt;-norm, where, {{mvar|q}} satisfies &lt;math&gt; \frac{1}{p} + \frac{1}{q} = 1&lt;/math&gt;, ''i.e.,'' &lt;math&gt; q = \frac{p}{p-1}.&lt;/math&gt;

As another example, consider the &lt;math&gt;\ell_2&lt;/math&gt;- or spectral norm on &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{R}^{m\times n}&lt;/math&gt;. The associated dual norm is

:&lt;math&gt;\lVert Z \rVert_{2*} = \sup\{\mathrm{\bf tr}(Z^\intercal X) |\; \lVert X \rVert_2 \leq 1 \},&lt;/math&gt;

which turns out to be the sum of the singular values,

:&lt;math&gt;\lVert Z \rVert_{2*} = \sigma_1(Z) + \ldots + \sigma_r(Z) = \mathrm{\bf tr} (Z^\intercal Z)^{\frac{1}{2}},&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt; r = \mathrm{\bf rank}\;Z&lt;/math&gt;. This norm is sometimes called the [[nuclear operator|''nuclear'' norm]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Boyd|Vandenberghe|2004|loc=[http://web.stanford.edu/~boyd/cvxbook/ p. 637]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Examples ==
&lt;!-- commenting out for now as this example seems to be redundant with the def'n provided in mathematical optimisation section.
# '''Dual Norm of Vectors'''
#:If ''p'', ''q'' ∈ &lt;math&gt;[1, \infty]&lt;/math&gt; satisfy &lt;math&gt;1/p+1/q=1&lt;/math&gt;, then the ℓ&lt;sup&gt;''p''&lt;/sup&gt; and ℓ&lt;sup&gt;''q''&lt;/sup&gt; norms are dual to each other.  
#:In particular the [[L2 norm|Euclidean norm]] is self-dual ({{nowrap|1=''p'' = ''q'' = 2}}).  Similarly, the [[Matrix_norm|Schatten ''p''-norm]] on matrices is dual to the Schatten ''q''-norm.
#:For &lt;math&gt;\sqrt{x^{\mathrm{T}}Qx}&lt;/math&gt;, the dual norm is &lt;math&gt;\sqrt{y^{\mathrm{T}}Q^{-1}y}&lt;/math&gt; with &lt;math&gt;Q&lt;/math&gt; positive definite. --&gt;

== Some basic results about the operator norm==

More generally, let &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;Y&lt;/math&gt; be topological vector spaces, and &lt;math&gt;L(X,Y)&lt;/math&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Each &lt;math&gt;L(X,Y)&lt;/math&gt; is a [[vector space]], with the usual definitions of addition and scalar multiplication of functions; this only depends on the vector space structure of &lt;math&gt;Y&lt;/math&gt;, not &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt; be the collection of all [[bounded operator|bounded linear mappings]] (or ''operators'') of &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; into &lt;math&gt;Y&lt;/math&gt;. In the case where &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;Y&lt;/math&gt; are normed vector spaces, &lt;math&gt;L(X,Y)&lt;/math&gt; can be normed in a natural way.

When &lt;math&gt;Y&lt;/math&gt; is a [[scalar field]] (i.e. &lt;math&gt;Y={\mathbb C}&lt;/math&gt; or &lt;math&gt;Y={\mathbb R}&lt;/math&gt;) so that &lt;math&gt;L(X,Y)&lt;/math&gt; is the [[dual space]] &lt;math&gt;X^*&lt;/math&gt; of &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt;.

'''Theorem 1''': Let &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;Y&lt;/math&gt; be normed spaces, and associate to each &lt;math&gt;f \in L(X,Y)&lt;/math&gt; the number:
: &lt;math&gt; \left\| f \right\| = \sup\{ \left| f(x) \right| : x \in X, \left\| x \right\| \leq 1\}&lt;/math&gt;

We first establish that &lt;math&gt;L(X,Y)&lt;/math&gt; is bounded (using the triangle inequality), and complete (using [[Cauchy sequence]]s) using our definition of &lt;math&gt;\|f\|&lt;/math&gt;, thereby making &lt;math&gt;L(X,Y)&lt;/math&gt; a normed space. If &lt;math&gt;Y&lt;/math&gt; is a Banach space, so is &lt;math&gt;L(X,Y)&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Rudin|1991|page=92}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Proof''': 
# A subset of a normed space is bounded [[if and only if]] it lies in some multiple of the [[unit sphere]]; thus &lt;math&gt;\lVert f \rVert &lt; \infty&lt;/math&gt; for every &lt;math&gt; f \in L(X,Y)&lt;/math&gt;
#: if &lt;math&gt;\alpha&lt;/math&gt; is a scalar, then &lt;math&gt;(\alpha f)(x) = \alpha \cdot fx&lt;/math&gt; so that 
#:: &lt;math&gt;\|\alpha f\| = |\alpha|\|f\|&lt;/math&gt;
#: The [[triangle inequality]] in &lt;math&gt;Y&lt;/math&gt; shows that
#:: &lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
\| (f_1 + f_2)x \| &amp;= \| f_1 x + f_2 x \| \leq \| f_1 x \| + \| f_2 x \| \\
&amp;\leq (\|f_1\| + \|f_2\|)\|x\| \leq \|f_1\| + \|f_2\|
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;
#: for every &lt;math&gt; x \in X&lt;/math&gt; with &lt;math&gt;\|x\| \leq 1&lt;/math&gt;. Thus
#:: &lt;math&gt; \| f_1 + f_2 \| \leq \|f_1\| + \|f_2\|&lt;/math&gt;
#: If &lt;math&gt;f \neq 0&lt;/math&gt;, then &lt;math&gt;fx \neq 0&lt;/math&gt; for some &lt;math&gt;x \in X&lt;/math&gt;; hence &lt;math&gt;\|f\| &gt; 0 &lt;/math&gt;. Thus, &lt;math&gt;L(X,Y)&lt;/math&gt; is a normed space.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Rudin|1991|page=93}}&lt;/ref&gt;
# Assume now that &lt;math&gt;Y&lt;/math&gt; is complete, and that &lt;math&gt;\{f_n\}&lt;/math&gt; is a [[Cauchy sequence]] in &lt;math&gt;L(X,Y)&lt;/math&gt;. 
#: Since

#: Hence
#:: &lt;math&gt; fx = \lim_{n\to\infty} f_n x&lt;/math&gt;

#:: &lt;math&gt; \| fx - f_m x \| \leq \varepsilon\|x\|&lt;/math&gt;
#: for sufficiently large {{mvar|m}}.
#: Hence &lt;math&gt;\| fx\| \leq (\|f_m\| + \varepsilon)\|x\|&lt;/math&gt;, so that &lt;math&gt; f \in L(X,Y)&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt; \| f - f_m \| \leq \varepsilon&lt;/math&gt;. 
#: Thus &lt;math&gt;f_m \to f&lt;/math&gt; in the norm of &lt;math&gt;L(X,Y)&lt;/math&gt;. This establishes the completeness of &lt;math&gt;L(X,Y)&lt;/math&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Rudin|1991|page=93}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3686">An '''early adopter''' (sometimes misspelled as ''early adapter'' or ''early adaptor'') or '''lighthouse customer''' is an early customer of a given company, product, or technology. The term originates from [[Everett M. Rogers]]' ''[[Diffusion of Innovations]]'' (1962).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

==History==
Typically this will be a customer who, in addition to using the vendor's product or technology, will also provide considerable and candid feedback to help the vendor refine its future product releases, as well as the associated means of distribution, service, and support.  

[[File:DiffusionOfInnovation.png|thumb|Early adopters as shown in the [[Technology adoption lifecycle|Rogers' bell curve]]|384x237px]]

The relationship is [[synergy|synergistic]], with the customer having early (and sometimes unique, or at least uniquely early) access to an advantageous new product or technology, but he or she also serves as a kind of [[Human subject research|guinea pig]].

In exchange for being an early adopter, and thus being exposed to the problems, risks, and annoyances common to early-stage product testing and deployment, the lighthouse customer is sometimes given especially attentive vendor assistance and support, even to the point of having personnel at the customer's work site to assist with implementation.
The customer is sometimes given preferential pricing, terms, and conditions, although new technology is often very expensive, so the early adopter still often pays quite a lot.

The vendor, on the other hand, benefits from receiving early
revenues, and also from a lighthouse customer's endorsement and assistance in further developing the product and its go-to-market mechanisms. Acquiring lighthouse customers is a common step in new product development and implementation. The real-world focus that this type  of relationship can bring to a vendor can be extremely valuable.

Early adoption does come with pitfalls: early versions of products may be buggy and/or prone to malfunction.  Furthermore, more efficient, and sometimes less expensive, versions of the product usually appear a few months after the initial release ([[Apple iPhone]]).&lt;ref&gt;[http://money.aol.com/top5/general/gadgets AOL Money]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.cnet.com/8301-13508_3-9790142-19.html Making sense of the million-dollar iPhone lawsuit]&lt;/ref&gt;  The trend of new technology costing more at release is often referred to as the "early adopter tax".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.cbsnews.com/8301-501465_162-3251293-501465.html | title=The Early Adopter's Gamble}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Edmund Robert Anthony de Unger''' ({{lang-hu|Ödön Antal Robert de Unger}}, b 6 August 1918, [[Budapest]] - d 25 January 2011, [[Ham, Surrey]]) was a Hungarian-born property developer and art collector. In London he built up the '''Keir Collection''', one of the greatest post-war collections of Islamic art,  bequeathed in 2008 to the [[Pergamon Museum of Islamic Art]] in [[Berlin]]. The arrangement for the museum to curate the collection came to an end in July 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.smb.museum/smb/export/downloadPM.php?id=2341|title=Die Keir Collection verlässt Berlin|
author=Museum für Islamische Kunst|date= 13 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The collection is now hosted by the [[Dallas Museum of Art]] as of May 2014 for a 15-year renewable loan.

==Life==
[[File:Manor-House-Ham-Street-Richmond.jpg|thumb|300px|The 18th century Manor House in [[Ham, Surrey]] that became the home to the Keir Collection]]
Edmund de Unger was born in Budapest into a family linked with the art world. His father was a private collector of carpets and another relative was the architect who designed the [[Hungarian National Museum]]. After going to London in 1934 to learn English, he studied [[economics]] at [[Kiel Institute for the World Economy]], [[law]] at the [[University of Budapest]] and [[history]] at [[Hertford College, Oxford]]. Returning to Hungary before the outbreak of [[World War II]], in 1945 he married Eva Spicht, one of 22 Jewish refugees whom he had taken in during the [[Battle of Budapest]]. After the war he restored and ran the [[Danubius Hotel Astoria|Astoria Hotel]] in Budapest, until it was requisitioned by the communist regime in 1948.

In 1949 de Unger, following a series of arrests in Hungary, moved permanently to England, working first as a [[manservant]]. After further training, he entered the legal profession as a [[barrister]]. He later worked as [[Crown Counsel]] in [[Ghana]] for the [[Colonial Office]]. The period in [[West Africa]] permitted visits to [[Egypt]], where he developed an interest in [[Coptic art|Coptic]] and [[Islamic art]]. On returning to England, de Unger became a property developer, which provided him with the means to build up his post-war art collection, which he named the "Keir Collection", after one of his first homes ''The Keir'' on [[Wimbledon Common]] in London. In 1965, following the death of his first wife Eva in 1959, he married Elizabeth Allen, with whom he had two sons, Richard and Glen.

The ever-increasing Keir Collection was moved in the late 1960s to his house in [[Ham, Surrey]]. The collection, which started in his youth with carpets, gradually grew to include ceramics, in particular rare items of [[lustreware]]  from [[Mesopotamia]], Persian and Moghul miniatures, medieval and Renaissance enamels, sculptures, and textiles from Italy and France (including the medieval enamels collection of Ernst and Martha Kofler-Truniger). Widely knowledgeable on the area in which he collected, de Unger founded the ''Islamic Art Circle'' in 1964 and lectured frequently on his expertise all over the world.&lt;ref&gt;See {{harvtxt|Obituary|2011}} and {{harvtxt|Grimes|2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Keir Collection==

===Carpets and textiles===
"My love of Islamic art began with carpets. I first became aware of them at the age of six, when my father Richard told me not to walk on them. [...] My father was a rather solitary person and, seeing my interest, he must have been pleased. He took me to museums, and by the age of nine I was quite a good companion to him in the salesrooms. [...] After the war and my departure from my homeland I was once again able to continue the collecting of what my fellow Oxford undergraduates had called "moth-eaten rags". Slowly, not only the floors but also the walls of my home became covered with new acquisitions." &lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Haase|2007|p=7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The majority of carpets that form the core of the Keir Collection remain in the 18th century Manor House on Ham Street in [[Richmond, London]], which was de Unger's home up to his death in 2011. A small but representative portion of classical oriental carpets from Persia, Turkey and [[Mughal Empire|Mughal India]] are on display in the Pergamon Museum of Islamic Art.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Haase|2007|pp=98–105}}&lt;/ref&gt;

His passion for collecting carpets soon led de Unger to diversify into fine textiles, starting in 1961 with the acquisition of Persian embroidery in Paris. He started collecting decorative silk, velvet and brocade fabrics, with elaborate designs resembling those in the carpets. There provenance included the Persian, Ottoman and Mughal empires, with [[Safavid art|Safavid]] silks forming the nucleus of his collection. It incorporates parts of the older textile collections of Joseph V. McMullan and [[Hagop Kevorkian]]. With Werner Abegg as mentor de Unger moved on to mediaeval and Renaissance woven cloth from Europe, particularly Italy and Spain, and in number these items dominate the collection.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Haase|2007|pp=80–97}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Ceramics===
"The end came when I observed every carpet on the floor was covered by at least two other layers. I realized it could not go on. It was at that moment that I had my first encounter with Islamic ceramics. Just like their woven counterparts these have the same combination of warmth of colour, delicacy and boldness of design. Above all, I admire the lustre ware which to my mind is the greatest gift the Islamic potter has made to mankind."&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Haase|2007|p=7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

De Unger's extensive collection of Islamic ceramics contains important examples from the mediaeval period, from the 8th to the 13th century. Some of the most prized items are of gold [[lustreware]], a technique that originated and was perfected in Iraq. These skills were passed on to artisans in [[Fatimid art|Fatimid Egypt]] and [[Kashan]] in Persia. The Persian lustreware tiles provide examples of figurative representations in Islamic art prior to the Mongol period.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Haase|2007|pp=70–79}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Rock crystal===
[[File:Keir-Collection-Fatimid-Rock-Crystal-Ewer.jpg|thumb|150px|11th century [[Fatimid art|Fatimid]] rock crystal ewer in Italian gold and enamel mount, acquired in 2008 for over £3 million for the Keir Collection]]
Rock crystal artefacts flourished during the [[Fatimid art|Fatimid period]] in Egypt (969-1171). Because of the difficulty of working with the very hard medium, only the caliph and his immediate court could afford these ''objets d'art'', which varied in size from small animal forms to large vessels. In 1068, however, the large collection of treasures in the Caliph's palace in ''al-Qahira'' (now part of modern-day Cairo) was dispersed throughout the medieval world as the result of a revolt by the unpaid army. Very few items from the reportedly large collection survive. Several of these rare sculpted rock crystals came to form parts of reliquaries in Medieval church treasuries, in mountings made for gold and precious stones. De Unger acquired several rock crystal pieces from this period for his collection including a fine vessel decorated with [[palmette]]s, set in an elaborate gold casing with handles formed of foliage and winged dragons. Other smaller items in the collection include several bottles, possibly intended for dispensing scent, and a bead in the form of a crouching hare, possibly intended as a charm.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Haase|2007|pp=64–69}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In October 2008 an 11th-century Fatimid rock crystal ewer was acquired for the Keir Collection at a public auction in [[Christie's]] by de Unger's son, Richard, for over £3 million. Set in a medieval Italian gold and enamel mount, the ewer had earlier in the year been offered for auction in [[Somerset]] as a nineteenth-century French claret decanter with an estimated price of between £100 and £200. Islamic art experts present at the auction recognized the rarity of the artifact, which sold for just over £200,000. Subsequently the owner withdrew the object from sale, placing it for auction at Christie's, who gave an evaluation with a starting price of £3 million, expecting a higher price, despite the [[financial crisis of 2007-2010|financial crisis]] at the time. When de Unger requested an export order so that the ewer could go on display in Berlin, the UK government sought its own evaluation from [[Sotheby's]], who returned a figure of £20 million, beyond the means of any public British art collection. With a change of government, Sotheby's figure was accepted and the ewer, one of only a very small number of surviving rock glass vessels of this type, is now on display in the [[Pergamon Museum of Islamic Art]].&lt;ref&gt;See {{harvtxt|Crane|2008}} and {{harvtxt|Bailey|2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Islamic art of the book===
"As a child, one of my favourite books was the ''Arabian Nights'', and its colourful descriptions and rich imaginative quality must have left a mark on me. The first Oriental miniature I consciously looked at was at the Musée d'Arts décoratifs in Paris [...] It was this painting that prompted me to buy my first book on Persian miniatures."&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Haase|2007|p=8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As {{harvtxt|Haase|2007}} stated at the start of his evaluation of de Unger's extensive collection of Islamic illuminated manuscripts, "A series of magnificent exhibitions of Islamic manuscript art and calligraphy has recently shown splendid masterpieces from several regions of the Orient and revealed the stereotype of Islam's hostility towards illustration and the "substitute art" of calligraphy as nothing more than '''absurd'''."  The collection of de Unger, although containing many examples of medieval calligraphy, particularly Korans, has an even larger number of illuminated figurative manuscripts.

The calligraphic manuscripts in the Keir Collection were produced by some of the most accomplished artists of the period from across the entire Islamic world. With intricate designs in luxurious gold and blue or polychrome, these date from the twelfth to the fifteenth century and originate from Syria, Spain, North Africa (particularly [[Mamluk]] Egypt), Iraq, Iran and India.

The miniature paintings on detached folios, which form the bulk of de Unger's collection, contain illustrations of Persian epic poems, including the celebrated [[Shahnameh]], the "Book of Kings", of [[Firdausi]] and the ''Khamsa'' of [[Nizami Ganjavi|Nizami]]. The figurative illuminated manuscripts cover the period from the early 14th century to the early 17th century and again range across the whole Islamic world, from Turkey to [[Mughal Empire|Mughal India]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Haase|2007|pp=14–55}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to folios from illuminated manuscripts, de Unger collected examples of Islamic bookbinding, one of the most highly developed skills in the Islamic world.  His collection includes Persian leather bindings, some polychromatic, embossed with highly ornamental designs in gold. There are also examples of bookbindings with flap, some with elaborate miniature [[lacquerwork]] painting either on leather or on a [[Papier mache binding|papier-mâché]] base.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Haase|2007|pp=56–63}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Metalwork===
[[File:Keir-Collection-Bronze-Silver-Display-Dish-13C-Iraq.jpg|thumb|Detail of winged sphinxes and other motifs on a late 13C bowl of bronze, with silver inlay, from Iraq (click for detail)]]
"I believe that no collection of Islamic art can be complete without metalwork [...] It tells us a great deal about the art of Islam, the inscriptions found on the metalware contributing significantly to the history of the subject. I recognize in Islamic metalwork that intrinsic quality which is the result of first-class workmanship."&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Haase|2007|p=8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The creation of finely wrought metalware, in gold, silver and copper alloys, was from the outset one of the most highly developed skills in Islamic art. The artefacts were produced for the whole range of society from the courtly elete to the merchant class. The Keir Collection reflects this diversity. Amongst the most precious objects are enamel and gold jewelry and engraved silverware; other household objects include engraved bronze [[ewer]]s, jugs, perfume bottles, [[aquamanile]]s, [[incense burner]]s and [[candlestick]]s from all over the Islamic world, from the 8th to the 16th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Haase|2007|pp=106–129}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Medieval enamels===
The collection of medieval and Renaissance enamels of Ernst and Martha Kofler-Truninger was purchased by de Unger in two parts in 1970 and 1971. It remained in the Keir Collection until 1997, when the bulk of the collection was auctioned at [[Sotheby's]] with a pre-sale estimate of $25 million that was not realised, with some items remaining unsold or withdrawn.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Obituary|2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="743">In [[telecommunication]], '''endurability''' is the property of a [[system]], subsystem, equipment, or process that enables it to continue to function within specified performance limits for an extended period of [[time]], usually months, despite a severe natural or man-made disturbance, such as a nuclear attack, or a loss of external logistic or utility support.  

Endurability is not compromised by temporary failures when the local capability exists to restore and maintain the system, subsystem, equipment, or process to an acceptable performance level.

'''Far-infrared astronomy''' is the branch of [[astronomy]] and [[astrophysics]] that deals with objects visible in [[far-infrared]] radiation (extending from 30 [[µm]] towards [[Submillimetre astronomy|submillimeter]] wavelengths around 450&amp;nbsp;µm).

In the far-infrared, stars are not especially bright, but we{{who|date=March 2018}} can see emission from very cold matter (140 Kelvins or less) that is not seen at shorter wavelengths.

Huge, cold clouds of gas and dust in [[Milky Way|our own galaxy]], as well as in nearby [[galaxy|galaxies]], glow in far-infrared light. This is due to [[thermal radiation]] of [[Interstellar Dust|interstellar dust]] contained in [[molecular clouds]].&lt;ref name="caltech"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ipac.caltech.edu/outreach/Edu/Regions/irregions.html|title=Near, Mid and Far-Infrared|accessdate=2013-01-28|publisher=Caltech Infrared Processing and Analysis Center|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://archive.is/20120529/http://www.ipac.caltech.edu/Outreach/Edu/Regions/irregions.html|archivedate=2012-05-29|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
In some of these clouds, new stars are just beginning to form. Far-infrared observations can detect these [[protostar]]s long before they "turn on" visibly by sensing the heat they radiate as they contract.

The center of our galaxy also shines brightly in the far-infrared: These emissions are from dust in [[circumstellar shell]]s around numerous old [[red giant]] stars. These stars heat up the dust and cause it to glow brightly in the [[infrared]]. The [[Bolocam Galactic Plane Survey (BGPS)|Bolocam Galactic Plane Survey]] mapped the galaxy for the first time in the far-infrared.&lt;ref name="caltech" /&gt;

Except for the plane of our own [[Milky Way|galaxy]], the brightest far-infrared object in the sky is central region of a [[galaxy]] called [[Messier 82]]. The nucleus of M82 radiates as much energy in the far-infrared as all of the stars in our galaxy combined. This far-infrared energy comes from dust heated by a source that is hidden from view. The central regions of most galaxies shine very brightly in the far-infrared. Many galaxies ("[[Active galaxy|active galaxies]]") have active [[galaxy nucleus|nuclei]] hidden in dense regions of dust. Others, called [[starburst galaxy|starburst galaxies]], have an extremely high number of newly forming stars heating [[interstellar cloud|interstellar dust clouds]]. These galaxies, far outshine all others galaxies in the far-infrared.&lt;ref name="caltech" /&gt;

The Earth's atmosphere is opaque over most of the far-infrared, so that ground-based observations are limited to submillimetre wavelengths using high-altitude telescopes such as the [[James Clerk Maxwell Telescope]], the [[Caltech Submillimeter Observatory]], the [[High Elevation Antarctic Terahertz Telescope]] and the [[Submillimeter Array]]. Most far-infrared astronomy is performed by satellites such as the [[Herschel Space Observatory]], [[Spitzer Space Telescope|Spitzer]], [[IRAS]], and [[Infrared Space Observatory|ISO]]. Upper-atmosphere observations are also possible, as conducted by the airborne [[Stratospheric Observatory for Infrared Astronomy|SOFIA]] telescope.

On 22 January 2014, [[European Space Agency|ESA scientists]] reported the detection, for the first definitive time, of [[water vapor]] on the [[dwarf planet]], [[Ceres (dwarf planet)|Ceres]], largest object in the [[asteroid belt]].&lt;ref name="KüppersO’Rourke2014"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Küppers |first1=Michael |last2=O’Rourke |first2=Laurence |last3=Bockelée-Morvan |first3=Dominique |last4=Zakharov |first4=Vladimir |last5=Lee |first5=Seungwon |last6=von Allmen |first6=Paul |last7=Carry |first7=Benoît |last8=Teyssier |first8=David |last9=Marston |first9=Anthony |last10=Müller |first10=Thomas |last11=Crovisier |first11=Jacques |last12=Barucci |first12=M.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="14408">Modern understanding of disease is very different from the way it was understood in ancient Greece and Rome. The way modern physicians approach healing of the sick differs greatly from the methods used by early general healers or elite physicians like Hippocrates or Galen. In modern medicine, the understanding of disease stems from the “germ theory of disease”, a concept that emerged in the second half of the 19th century, such that a disease is the result of an invasion of a microorganism into a living host. Therefore, when a person becomes ill, modern treatments “target” the specific pathogen or bacterium in order to “beat” or “kill” the disease. In Ancient Greece and Rome, disease was literally understood as dis-ease, or physical imbalance. Medical intervention, therefore, was purposed with goal of restoration of harmony rather than waging a war against disease.&lt;ref name="Food in Antiquity"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Wilkins|first1=John|title=Food in Antiquity|date=1995|publisher=University of Exeter Press|isbn=0-85989-418-5|page=345|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt; Surgery was regarded by Greek and Roman physicians as extreme and damaging while prevention was seen as the crucial first step to healing almost all ailments. In both prevention and treatment of disease in classical medicine, food and diet was central. The eating of correctly-balanced foods made up the majority of preventative treatment as well as to restore harmony to the body after it encountered disease.

== Food and Diet in Ancient Greece ==

=== Humours and Causes of Disease ===
Ancient Greek Medicine is described as rational, ethical and based upon observation, conscious learning and experience. Superstition and religious dogmatism are often excluded from descriptions of ancient Greek medicine. It is important, however, to note that this rational approach to medicine did not always exist in the ancient Greek medical world, nor was it the only popular method of healing. Along with rational Greek medicine, disease was also thought of as being of supernatural origin, resulting from the unhappiness of the gods or from demonic possession. Exorcists and religious healers were among the ‘doctors’ that patients sought out when they became ill. Sacrifices, exorcisms, spells and prayers were then carried out in order to reconcile with the gods and restore health to the patient. It was not until the time of [[Hippocrates]], between 450 and 350 BC, that rational, observation and the humoral theory of medicine began to become highly influential.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Nutton|first1=Vivian|title=Healing and the healing act in Classical Greece|journal=European Review|date=1999|volume=7|issue=1|page=30}}&lt;/ref&gt; The theory of the humours or “[[Humorism]]” understood the human body to be composed of fluid (humours) and regarded disease as a result of an imbalance of the four humors: yellow bile, black bile, phlegm and blood.[[File:Humorism.svg|thumb|The four humours and their qualities]] These humours contain qualities such as hot, cool, moist, dry, etc., which must also remain in balance.&lt;ref name="Food in Antiquity" /&gt;{{rp|337}} Foods can be heating, cooling, or generative of one humour. Some foods produce good juices and others bad juices and often times cooking and preparation of the foods can change or improve the juices of the foods. In addition, foods may be easy to assimilate (easy to pass through the body), easily excreted, nourishing or not nourishing.&lt;ref name="Food in Antiquity" /&gt;{{rp|338}}  In Hippocratic medicine, the qualities in foods are analogous to the four humors in the body: too much of a single one is bad, a proper mixture is ideal.&lt;ref name="Food in Antiquity" /&gt;{{rp|347}} Therefore, the consumption of correctly-balanced foods and life-style of the patient was crucial to the prevention and treatment of disease in Ancient Greece.

This brings us to the way in which [[seasonal food]] played an important role in the treatment of ancient disease. According to the Hippocratic author of “Airs, Waters and Places” (there remains debate as to whether Hippocrates himself wrote the Hippocratic Corpus), it is important that a physician learn astronomy because, “the changes of the seasons produce changes in diseases,”.&lt;ref name=Hippocratic&gt;{{cite book|last1=Chadwick|first1=edited with an introduction by G.E.R. Lloyd ; translated [from the Greek] by J.|last2=al.]|first2=W.N. Mann ... [et|title=Hippocratic writings|date=1983|publisher=Penguin|location=Harmondsworth|isbn=0-14-044451-3|page=149|edition=[New] ed., with additional material, Repr. in Penguin classics.}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the same Hippocratic text, the author goes on to explain that villages facing east and that are exposed to winds from the north-east, south-east and west tended to be healthy and, “The climate in such a district may be compared with the spring in that there are no extremes of heat and cold. As a consequence, diseases in such a district are few and not severe,”.&lt;ref name="Hippocratic" /&gt;{{rp|151}} As an example of the importance of seasonal food on maintaining balance of the humours and preventing disease is given by Hippocrates in “On Regimen” when the authors state that, “in winter, to secure a dry and hot body it is better to eat wheaten bread, roast meat, and few vegetables; whereas in summer it is appropriate to eat barley cake, barley meat and softer foods,” (qtd. in Wilkins et al., p.&amp;nbsp;346).

=== Food and Diet in the Hippocratic Aphorisms ===
Food and diet feature prominently in the aphorisms of the Hippocratic Corpus. For example, in one aphorism in the first section, Hippocrates states, “Things which are growing have the greatest natural warmth and, accordingly, need most nourishment. Failing this the body becomes exhausted. Old men have little warmth and they need little food which produces warmth; too much only extinguishes the warmth they have. For this reason, fevers are not so acute in old people for then the body is cold”.&lt;ref name="Hippocratic" /&gt;{{rp|208}} Another aphorism says, “It is better to be full of drink than full of food”.&lt;ref name="Hippocratic" /&gt;{{rp|209}} And finally, an aphorism that generally sums up treatment of disease in Hippocratic times states, “Disease which results from over-eating is cured by fasting; disease following fasting, by a surfeit. So with other things; cures may be effected by opposites,”.&lt;ref name="Hippocratic" /&gt;{{rp|210}} This concept of treating diseases opposite to the way it manifests in the individual is concept that is carried over into Roman medicine.

=== Gout in Ancient Greece ===
[[Gout]] was called podagra in ancient Greek medicine and is a common arthritis caused by deposition of monosodium urate crystals within the joints.&lt;ref name=Gritzalis&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Gritzalis|first1=Konstantinos C.|title=Gout in the Writings of Eminent Ancient Greek and Byzantine Physicians|journal=Acta med-hist Adriat|date=2011|volume=9|issue=1|page=83}}&lt;/ref&gt; Gout usually affects the first metatarsophalangeal joint of the big toe and later the other joints of the feet and hands. Hippocrates considered gout to be the result of an accumulation of one of the body humours that distended the joint and caused pain.&lt;ref name=Gout&gt;{{cite book|last1=Porter|first1=Roy|last2=Rousseau|first2=G.S.|title=Gout: The Patrician Malady|date=2000|publisher=Yale University Press|isbn=0-300-08274-6|page=14}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hippocrates also believed gout to be a result from sexual excess or too rich a diet as alluded to in three of his aphorisms “Eunuchs do not take the gout nor become bald”, “A woman does not take the gout unless her menses has stopped”, and “A young man does not take the gout until he indulges coitus”.&lt;ref name="Gritzalis" /&gt;{{rp|84}}&lt;ref name="Gout" /&gt;{{rp|14–15}} As with other diseases, physicians in antiquity believed that diet was the best way to manage gout. Hippocrates recommended high doses of white hellebore because he believed that the best and most natural relief for gout was dysentery.&lt;ref name="Gritzalis" /&gt;{{rp|85}} However, purging with white hellebore was probably for the more chronic cases due to the fact that wine and barleywater drinks were very strongly recommended.&lt;ref name="Gout" /&gt;{{rp|16–17}}

=== Legumes in Ancient Greece ===
The importance of legumes in ancient Greek diet and medical practice is often disregarded. However, legumes improved the quality of the soil and were considered very important to the agriculturalists of the time. Additionally, legumes contain a high amount of albumen, which led them to be a critical dietary supplement in countries where meat was in short supply and difficult to store. Such was the case with Greece. People in the Graeco-Roman world consumed less meat than we do today and therefore, legumes were a necessary source of protein.&lt;ref name="Legumes"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Flint-Hamilton|first1=Kimberly B.|title=Legumes in Ancient Greece and Rome: Food, Medicine, or Poison?|journal=Hesperia: The Journal of the American School of Classical Studies at Athens|date=1999|volume=68|issue=3|page=374|jstor=148493}}&lt;/ref&gt; Of all legumes, the [[lentil]] [[File:Illustration Lens culinaris0.jpg|thumb|The lentil plant]] appears most frequently in Greek and Roman literature. Medicinally, Hippocrates recommends lentils as a remedy for ulcers and hemorrhoids.&lt;ref name="Legumes" /&gt;{{rp|376}} Bitter vetch, or [[Vicia ervilia]], was also an important legume in ancient Greek medicine. The extensive medicinal qualities of the bitter vetch were thought reliable enough to later administer to Roman emperors such as [[Augustus]].&lt;ref name="Legumes" /&gt;{{rp|379}} Bitter vetch was thought to heal pimples, prevent sores from spreading and soothe spots or sores when they appear on the breasts. It was also reported to relieve painful urination, flatulence, liver problems, and indigestion when roasted and mixed with honey and Hippocrates cautioned that when eaten boiled or raw, the consumption of bitter vetch may cause more flatulence or pain.&lt;ref name="Legumes" /&gt;{{rp|379}}

== Food and Diet in Ancient Rome ==

=== Humours, Anatomy and the Causes of Disease ===
At the heart of Roman Medicine and central to the development of Western Medicine is [[Galen]] [[File:Galenus.jpg|thumb|The Eminent Galen of Pergamum]]of Pergamum (AD 129–c. AD 210).&lt;ref name=WMT&gt;{{cite book|last1=Conrad|first1=Lawrence I.|title=The Western medical tradition, 800 BC to AD 1800|date=1998|publisher=Cambridge University Press|location=Cambridge|isbn=0-521-47564-3|pages=58–70|edition=Reprinted.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Galen was a prolific writer from whose surviving works comes what Galen believed to be the definitive guide to a healthy diet, based on the theory of the four humours.&lt;ref name="Galen on Food"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Grant|first1=Mark|title=Galen on Food and DIet|date=2000|publisher=Routledge|location=London|isbn=0-415-23232-5|page=10}}&lt;/ref&gt; Galen understood the humoral theory in a dynamic sense rather than static sense such that yellow bile is hot and dry like fire; black bile is dry and cold like earth; phlegm is cold and moist like water; and blood is moist and hot.&lt;ref name="A History of Medicine"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Prioreschi|first1=Plinio|title=A History of Medicine: Roman medicine|date=1998|publisher=Edwin Mellen Press|isbn=978-1-888456-03-5|page=360}}&lt;/ref&gt; He also understood the humours to be produced by food through digestion and it is with digestion, and respiration, that Galen applies his knowledge of anatomy. According to Galen, digestion begins in the mouth because this where food comes into contact with the saliva. The chewed food is then pulled into the stomach where the heat of the stomach cooks the food into chyle. The chyle is then carried to the liver where the nutrients are converted to blood and transported throughout the body,.&lt;ref name="A History of Medicine" /&gt;{{rp|420–421}} With this understanding of the humours as being dynamic, and his knowledge of anatomy, Galen was able to categorize illnesses as hot, cold, dry or moist and attribute the causes of these illnesses to specific types of foods. For example, in Galen’s own “On the Causes of Disease”, as cited by Mark Grant, Galen says when describing hot diseases that, “[one cause of excessive heat] lies in foods that have hot and harsh powers, such as garlic, leeks, onions, and so on. Immoderate use of these foods sometimes sparks a fever,”.&lt;ref name="Galen on Food" /&gt;{{rp|48}} Galen believed that a good physician must also be a good cook.&lt;ref name="Galen on Food" /&gt;{{rp|11}} Therefore, in Galen’s dietary treatise “On the Powers of Foods”, recipes are often given in addition to descriptions of foods as being salty or sweet, sour or watery, difficult or easy to digest, costive or laxative, cooling or heating, etc. Galen insists that the balance of the four humours can be beneficially or adversely effected by ‘diet’ which in Galenic medicine includes not just food and drink but also physical exercise, baths, massage, and climate&lt;ref name="selected works"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Singer|first1=P.N|title=Galen selected works|date=1997|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=England|isbn=978-0-19-158627-9 |page=X|url=http://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&amp;scope=site&amp;db=nlebk&amp;db=nlabk&amp;AN=12310}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Food and the Treatment of Disease in Ancient Rome ===
As mentioned, certain types of food can affect the balance of the humours in different ways. According to Galen’s “On Humours,” as referenced by Wilkins et al., beef, camel, and goat meat, snails, cabbage, and soft cheeses produce black bile; brains, fungi, and hard apples cause phlegm; bitter almonds and garlic reduce phlegm.&lt;ref name="Food in Antiquity" /&gt;{{rp|377}} Additionally, for the treatment of gout, Galen suggested a range of dressings to be applied to the affected area made of mandrake, caper, and henbane and for the acute phase, creams made of seeds of conium, mushroom, and deer brain were administered.&lt;ref name="Gritzalis" /&gt;{{rp|86}}

{{Love sidebar|types}}
'''Friendship''' is a relationship of mutual [[affection]] between people.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |encyclopedia=Oxford Dictionaries |publisher=Oxford Dictionary Press |title=Definition for friend |url=http://oxforddictionaries.com/definition/friend |accessdate=25 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Friendship is a stronger form of [[Interpersonal relationship|interpersonal bond]] than an association. Friendship has been studied in academic fields such as [[Communication studies|communication]], [[sociology]], [[social psychology]], [[anthropology]], and [[philosophy]]. Various academic theories of friendship have been proposed, including [[social exchange theory]], [[equity theory]], [[relational dialectics]], and [[attachment styles]].

Although there are many forms of friendship, some of which may vary from place to place, certain characteristics are present in many types of such bonds. Such characteristics include affection; [[kindness]], [[love]], [[virtue]], [[sympathy]], [[empathy]], [[honesty]], [[altruism]], [[loyalty]], mutual [[understanding]] and [[compassion]], enjoyment of each other's company, [[Trust (social sciences)|trust]], and the ability to be oneself, express one's feelings to others, and make mistakes without fear of judgment from the friend.

==Developmental psychology==
===Childhood===
[[Image:Childhood friends at a carnival.jpg|thumb|Childhood friends]]
The understanding of friendship in children tends to be more heavily focused on areas such as common activities, physical proximity, and shared expectations.&lt;ref name="bremner"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Bremner|first1=J. Gavin|title=An Introduction to Developmental Psychology|date=May 8, 2017|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons|isbn=9781405186520|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=U-YGCwAAQBAJ|accessdate=26 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|498}}{{efn|In comparison to older respondents, who tend to describe friendship in terms of psychological rather than mostly physical aspects.&lt;ref name="bremner"/&gt;{{rp|498}}}} These friendships provide opportunity for [[Play (activity)|playing]] and practicing [[Emotional self-regulation|self-regulation]].&lt;ref name="oxford"/&gt;{{rp|246}} Most children tend to describe friendship in terms of things like [[sharing]], and children are more likely to share with someone they consider to be a friend.&lt;ref name="oxford"/&gt;{{rp|246}}&lt;ref name="Newman, B. M. 2012"&gt;Newman, B. M. &amp; Newman, P.R. (2012). Development Through Life: A Psychosocial Approach. Stanford, CT.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://elitedaily.com/life/culture/childhood-friends-most-important-friends/1063153/|title=Your Childhood Friendships Are The Best Friendships You'll Ever Have|last=|first=|date=17 Jun 2015|website=|publisher=|access-date=21 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; As children mature, they become less individualized and are more aware of others. They gain the ability to empathize with their friends, and enjoy playing in groups. They also experience peer rejection as they move through the middle childhood years. Establishing good friendships at a young age helps a child to be better acclimated in society later on in their life.&lt;ref name="Newman, B. M. 2012"/&gt;

Based upon the reports of teachers and mothers, 75% of preschool children had at least one friend. This figure rose to 78% through the [[fifth grade]], as measured by co-nomination as friends, and 55% had a mutual best friend.&lt;ref name="oxford"/&gt;{{rp|247}} About 15% of children were found to be chronically friendless, reporting periods without mutual friends at least six months.&lt;ref name="oxford"/&gt;{{rp|250}}

Potential benefits of friendship include the opportunity to learn about empathy and problem solving.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Kennedy-Moore|first= E. |year=2013|title= What Friends Teach Children|url= http://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/growing-friendships/201305/what-friends-teach-children}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Coaching from parents can be useful in helping children to make friends. [[Eileen Kennedy-Moore]] describes three key ingredients of children's friendship formation: (1) openness, (2) similarity, and (3) shared fun.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Kennedy-Moore|first= E. |year=2012|title= How children make friends (part 1)|url= http://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/growing-friendships/201209/how-children-make-friends-part-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Kennedy-Moore|first= E. |year=2012|title= How children make friends (part 2)|url= http://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/growing-friendships/201209/how-children-make-friends-part-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Kennedy-Moore|first= E. |year=2012|title= How children make friends (part 3)|url= http://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/growing-friendships/201209/how-children-make-friends-part-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; Parents can also help children understand social guidelines they haven't learned on their own.&lt;ref&gt;Elman, N.

Academic Press: New York.&lt;/ref&gt; and others, Kennedy-Moore outlines developmental stages in children's friendship, reflecting an increasing capacity to understand others' perspectives: "I Want It My Way", "What's In It For Me?", "By the Rules", "Caring and Sharing", and "Friends Through Thick and Thin."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Kennedy-Moore|first= E. |year=2012|title= Children's Growing Friendships|url=http://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/growing-friendships/201202/childrens-growing-friendships}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Adolescence===
[[File:Bhutan, Friends - Flickr - babasteve.jpg|thumb|Two friends in Bhutan]]
In adolescence, friendships become "more giving, sharing, frank, supportive, and spontaneous." Adolescents tend to seek out peers who can provide such qualities in a [[Reciprocity (social and political philosophy)|reciprocal relationship]], and to avoid peers whose problematic behavior suggest they may not be able to satisfy these needs.&lt;ref name="reisman"/&gt; Relationships begin to maintain a focus on shared values, [[loyalty]], and common interests, rather than physical concerns like proximity and access to play things that more characterize childhood.&lt;ref name="oxford"/&gt;{{rp|246}}

A study performed at the [[University of Texas at Austin]] examined over 9,000 American adolescents to determine how their engagement in problematic behavior (such as stealing, fighting, and truancy) was related to their friendships. Findings indicated that adolescents were less likely to engage in problem behavior when their friends did well in school, participated in school activities, avoided drinking, and had good [[mental health]]. The opposite was found regarding adolescents who did engage in problematic behavior. Whether adolescents were influenced by their friends to engage in problem behavior depended on how much they were exposed to those friends, and whether they and their friendship groups "fit in" at school.&lt;ref&gt;Crosnoe, R., &amp; Needham, B. (2004) [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15015689 Holism, contextual variability, and the study of friendships in adolescent development]. [[University of Texas at Austin]].&lt;/ref&gt;

A study by researchers from [[Purdue University]] found that friendships formed during [[Higher education|post-secondary education]] last longer than friendships formed earlier.&lt;ref&gt;Sparks, Glenn (August 7, 2007). [http://news.uns.purdue.edu/x/2007b/070807SparksFriendship.html Study shows what makes college buddies lifelong friends]. [[Purdue University]].&lt;/ref&gt;

===Adulthood===
[[File:3 barefoot females smiling and sitting on a bench.jpg|thumb|Friendships in adulthood]]
Friendship in adulthood provides companionship, affection, as well as emotional support, and contributes positively to mental well-being and improved physical health.&lt;ref name="enc"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Schulz|first1=Richard|title=The Encyclopedia of Aging: Fourth Edition, 2-Volume Set|date=2006|publisher=[[Springer Publishing|Springer Publishing Company]]|isbn=9780826148445|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=tgS29D0Mr4gC|accessdate=27 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|426}}

Adults may find it particularly difficult to maintain meaningful friendships in the workplace. "The workplace can crackle with competition, so people learn to hide vulnerabilities and quirks from colleagues. Work friendships often take on a transactional feel; it is difficult to say where networking ends and real friendship begins."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Williams|first=Alex|title=Friends of a Certain Age: Why Is It Hard To Make Friends Over 30?|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2012/07/15/fashion/the-challenge-of-making-friends-as-an-adult.html?pagewanted=all|work=[[The New York Times]]|accessdate=October 25, 2012|date=13 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Most adults value the financial security of their jobs more than friendship with coworkers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Bryant|first=Susan|title=Workplace Friendships: Asset or Liability?|url=http://career-advice.monster.com/in-the-office/workplace-issues/workplace-friendships-asset-or-liab/article.aspx|website=[[Monster.com]]|accessdate=October 25, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The majority of adults have an average of two close friends.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/technology/facebook/8876376/Most-adults-have-only-two-close-friends.html|title=Most adults have 'only two close friends'|date=November 8, 2011|last=Willis|first=Amy|work=The Telegraph|accessdate=August 11, 2013|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; Numerous studies with adults suggest that friendships and other supportive relationships do enhance self-esteem.&lt;ref name="www2.psych.purdue.edu"&gt;Berndt, T. J. (2002). [http://www2.psych.purdue.edu/~berndt/Friendship%20quality%20and%20social%20development.pdf Friendship Quality and Social Development]. American Psychological Society. [[Purdue University]].&lt;/ref&gt;

===Older adults===
[[Old age|Older adults]] continue to report high levels of personal satisfaction in their friendships as they age, and even as the overall number of friends tends to decline. This satisfaction is associated with an increased ability to accomplish [[activities of daily living]], as well as a reduced decline in [[Cognition|cognitive abilities]], decreased instances of hospitalization, and better outcomes related to [[Physical medicine and rehabilitation|rehabilitation]].&lt;ref name="enc"/&gt;{{rp|427}} The overall number of reported friends in later life may be mediated by increased lucidity, better speech and vision, and marital status.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Blieszner|first1=Rosemary|last2=Adams|first2=Rebecca G.|title=Adult Friendship|date=Jun 10, 1992|publisher=SAGE|isbn=9780803936737|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=oGs5DQAAQBAJ|accessdate=27 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|53}}

As on review phrased it:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Research within the past four decades has now consistently found that older adults reporting the highest levels of happiness and general well being also report strong, close ties to numerous friends.&lt;ref name="brain"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Nussbaum|first1=Jon F.|last2=Federowicz|first2=Molly|last3=Nussbaum|first3=Paul D.|title=Brain Health and Optimal Engagement for Older Adults|date=February 9, 2010|publisher=Editorial Aresta S.C.|isbn=9788493744007|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=JwxrMe5Fo6QC|accessdate=27 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

As family responsibilities and vocational pressures lessen, friendships become more important. Among the elderly, friendships can provide links to the larger community, serve as a protective factor against depression and loneliness, and compensate for potential losses in social support previously given by family members.&lt;ref name="yearbook"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Burleson|first1=Brant R.|title=Communication Yearbook 19|date=Mar 22, 2012|publisher=[[Routledge]]|isbn=9780415873178|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=G8mMAgAAQBAJ|accessdate=27 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|32-3}} Especially for people who cannot go out as often, interactions with friends allow for continued societal interaction. Additionally, older adults in declining health who remain in contact with friends show improved psychological well-being.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=http://www.pearsonhighered.com/educator/product/Exploring-Lifespan-Development-3E/9780205957385.page|title=Pearson – Exploring Lifespan Development, 3/E|author=Laura E. Berk|year=2014|pages=696|isbn=9780205957385}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Developmental issues==

===Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder===
Children with [[attention deficit hyperactivity disorder]] (ADHD) may have difficulty forming and maintaining friendships, due to a limited ability to build [[social skills]] through [[observational learning]], difficulties attending to [[social cues]], and because of the social impacts of [[impulsive behavior]] and a greater tendency to engage in behavior that may be seen as disruptive by their peers.&lt;ref name="hoza"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Wiener|first1=Judith|last2=Schneider|first2=Barry H.|title=A multisource exploration of the friendship patterns of children with and without learning disabilities|journal=Journal of Abnormal Child Psychology|date=2002|volume=30|issue=2|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/11369370|pages=127–41|accessdate=26 September 2017|pmid=12002394}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a 2007 review, no treatment was identified which effectively address peer functioning in children with ADHD, and treatments which addressed other aspects of the disorder were not found to eliminate issues related to peer functioning.&lt;ref name="hoza"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Hoza|first1=Betsy|title=Peer Functioning in Children With ADHD|journal=''Journal of Pediatric Psychology''|date=June 7, 2007|volume=32|issue=6|pages=101–106|doi=10.1016/j.ambp.2006.04.011|pmid=17261489|pmc=2572031}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Autism===
Certain symptoms of [[autism spectrum]] disorders can interfere with the formation of interpersonal relations, such as a preference for routine actions, resistance to change, obsession with particular interests or rituals, and a lack of [[social skills]]. Children with autism have been found to be more likely to be close friends of one person, rather than having groups of friends. Additionally, they are more likely to be close friends of other children with some sort of a disability.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Bauminger|first1=Nirit|last2=Solomon |first2=Marjorie |last3=Aviezer|first3=Anat|last4=Heung|first4=Kelly|last5=Gazit|first5=Lilach|last6=Brown|first6=John|last7=Rogers|first7=Sally J.|title=Children with Autism and Their Friends: A Multidimensional Study of Friendship in High-Functioning Autism Spectrum Disorder|journal=Journal of Abnormal Child Psychology|date=3 January 2008|volume=36|issue=2|pages=135–150|doi=10.1007/s10802-007-9156-x|pmid=18172754}}&lt;/ref&gt; A sense of parental attachment aids in the quality of friendships in children with autism spectrum disorders; a sense of attachment with one's parents compensates for a lack of social skills that would usually inhibit friendships.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Bauminger|first1=Nirit|last2=Solomon|first2=Marjorie|last3=Rogers|first3=Sally J.|title=Predicting Friendship Quality in Autism Spectrum Disorders and Typical Development|journal=Journal of Autism and Developmental Disorders|date=29 December 2009|volume=40|issue=6|pages=751–761|doi=10.1007/s10803-009-0928-8|pmid=20039110|pmc=2864904}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A study done by Frankel et al. showed that parental intervention and instruction plays an important role in such children developing friendships.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Frankel|first1=Fred|last2=Myatt|first2=Robert|last3=Sugar|first3=Catherine|author3-link=Catherine Sugar|last4=Whitham|first4= Cynthia|last5=Gorospe|first5=Clarissa M.|last6=Laugeson|first6=Elizabeth|title=A Randomized Controlled Study of Parent-assisted Children's Friendship Training with Children having Autism Spectrum Disorders|journal= Journal of Autism and Developmental Disorders|date=8 January 2010|volume=40|issue=7|pages=827–842|doi=10.1007/s10803-009-0932-z|pmid=20058059|pmc=2890979}}&lt;/ref&gt; Along with parental intervention, school professionals play an important role in teaching social skills and peer interaction. Paraprofessionals, specifically one-on-one aides and classroom aides, are often placed with children with autism spectrum disorders in order to facilitate friendships and guide the child in making and maintaining substantial friendships.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Rossetti|first1=Zachary|first2=Deborah|last2=Goessling|title=Paraeducators' Roles in Facilitating Friendships Between Secondary Students With and Without Autism Spectrum Disorders or Developmental Disabilities|journal=Teaching Exceptional Children|date=July–August 2010|volume=42|series=6|pages=64–70}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although lessons and training may help peers of children with autism, bullying is still a major concern in social situations. According to Anahad O'Connor of ''[[The New York Times]]'', bullying is most likely to occur against children with [[autism spectrum disorder]]s who have the most potential to live independently. Such children are more at risk because they have as many of the rituals and lack of social skills as children with full autism, but they are more likely to be [[Mainstreaming (education)|mainstreamed]] in school, since they are on the higher-functioning end of the autism spectrum. Children with autism have more difficulty attending to [[social cue]]s, and so may not always recognize when they are being bullied.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=O'Connor|first=Anahad|title=School Bullies Prey on Children With Autism|url=http://well.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/09/03/school-bullies-prey-on-children-with-autism/|newspaper=[[The New York Times]]|date=3 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Down syndrome===
Children with [[Down syndrome]] have increased difficulty forming friendships. They experience a [[language delay]] causing them to have a harder time playing with other children. Most children with Down syndrome may prefer to watch other students and play ''alongside'' a friend but not ''with'' them, mostly because they understand more than they can outwardly express. In preschool years, children with Down syndrome can benefit from the classroom setting, surrounded by other children and less dependent on adult aid. Children with this disability benefit from a variety of interactions with both adults and children. At school, ensuring an inclusive environment in the classroom can be difficult, but proximity to close friends can be crucial for social development.&lt;ref&gt;"Recreation &amp; Friendship."

==Health==
Studies have found that strong social supports improve a persons's prospects for good health and longevity. Conversely, loneliness and a lack of social supports have been linked to an increased risk of [[Cardiovascular disease|heart disease]], viral [[infection]]s, and [[cancer]], as well as higher mortality rates overall. Two researchers have even termed friendship networks a "behavioral [[vaccine]]" that boosts both physical and mental health.&lt;ref&gt;Friendship, social support, and health. 2007 Sias, Patricia M; Bartoo, Heidi. In L'Abate, Luciano. ''Low-cost approaches to promote physical and mental health: Theory, research, and practice''. (pp. 455–472). xxii, 526 pp. New York, NY, US: Springer Science + Business Media.&lt;/ref&gt; 

There is a large body of research linking friendship and health, but the precise reasons for the connection remain unclear. Most of the studies in this area are large [[Prospective cohort study|prospective studies]] that follow people over time, and while there may be a [[Correlation does not imply causation|correlation]] between the two variables (friendship and health status), researchers still do not know if there is a cause and effect relationship, such as the notion that good friendships actually improve health. A number of theories have attempted to explain this link. These theories have included that good friends encourage their friends to lead more healthy lifestyles; that good friends encourage their friends to seek help and access services when needed; that good friends enhance their friends' coping skills in dealing with illness and other health problems; and that good friends actually affect physiological pathways that are protective of health.&lt;ref&gt;Social networks and health: It's time for an intervention trial. 2005. Jorm, Anthony F. Journal of Epidemiology &amp; Community Health. Vol 59(7) Jul 2005, 537–538.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Mental health===
The lack of friendship has been found to play a role in increasing risk of [[suicidal ideation]] among female adolescents, including having more friends who were not themselves friends with one another.

Higher friendship quality directly contributes to self-esteem, self-confidence, and social development.&lt;ref name="www2.psych.purdue.edu"/&gt; A [[World Database of Happiness|World Happiness Database]] study found that people with close friendships are happier, although the absolute number of friends did not increase happiness.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/magazine-23097143 | work=BBC News | title=Can we make ourselves happier? | date=1 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;Other studies have suggested that children who have friendships of a high quality may be protected against the development of certain disorders, such as anxiety and depression.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Brendgen | first1 = M. | last2 = Vitaro | first2 = F. | last3 = Bukowski | first3 = W.

==Dissolution==
The dissolution of a friendship may be viewed as a personal rejection, or may be the result of natural changes over time, as friends grow more distant both physically and emotionally. The disruption of friendships has been associated with increased [[Guilt (emotion)|guilt]], [[anger]] and [[Depression (mood)|depression]], and may be highly stressful events, especially in childhood. However, potential negative effects can be mitigated if the dissolution of a friendship is replaced with another close relationship.&lt;ref name="oxford"/&gt;{{rp|248}}

==Demographics==
Friends tend to be more similar to one another in terms of age, gender, behavior, [[substance abuse]], personal disposition, and academic performance.&lt;ref name="oxford"/&gt;{{rp|248}}&lt;ref name="enc"/&gt;{{rp|426}}&lt;ref name="brain"/&gt;{{rp|55–6}} In [[Multiculturalism|ethnically diverse]] countries, there is broad evidence that children and adolescents tend to form friendships with others of the same race or ethnicity, beginning in [[preschool]], and peaking in middle or late childhood.&lt;ref name="oxford"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Zelazo|first1=Philip David|title=The Oxford Handbook of Developmental Psychology, Vol. 2: Self and Other|date=Mar 14, 2013|publisher=OUP USA|isbn=9780199958474|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=5m_D4NYVRI8C|accessdate=26 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|264}}

===Gender differences===
In general, female-female friendship interactions among children tend to be more focused on interpersonal connections and [[social support|mutual support]], while male-male interaction tends to be more focused on [[social status]], and may actively discourage the expression of emotional needs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Harris|first1=Margaret|title=Developmental Psychology: A Student's Handbook|date=2002|publisher=Taylor &amp; Francis|isbn=9781841691923|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=7yLl11fWXr8C|accessdate=26 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|320-2}} Females report more anxiety, jealousy, and relational victimization and less stability related to their friendships, and males report higher levels of physical victimization. Although males and females tend to report comparative levels of satisfaction with their friendships.&lt;ref name="oxford"/&gt;{{rp|249–50}}

Among older adults, women tend to be more socially adept than their male peers, and many older men may rely upon a female companion, such as a spouse, in order to compensate for their comparative lack of social skills.&lt;ref name="brain"/&gt;{{rp|55}}

==In animals==
{{see also|Ethology|Altruism in animals|Sociobiology}}
[[File:CUTE FRIENDSHIP.JPG|thumb|A man with a squirrel]]
Friendship is also found among animals of higher intelligence, such as higher [[mammal]]s and some [[bird]]s. Cross-species friendships are common between humans and [[domestic animal]]s. Cross-species friendships may also occur between two non-human animals, such as [[dog]]s and [[cat]]s. Research by McLennan measured the heart rates of [[cattle]], and showed that the cows were more stressed when alone or with an unfamiliar cow than they were with friends, lending support to the idea that cows are social animals, capable of forming close bonds with each other.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Heifer so lonely: How cows have best friends and get stressed when they are separated|url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sciencetech/article-2011124/Cows-best-friends-stressed-separated.html|accessdate=19 March 2012|newspaper=Mail Online|date=5 July 2011|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The obsolete [[German language|German]] legal concept ''Kranzgeld'' (literally "wreath money") is '''heart balm''' (see [[breach of promise]]) rewarded as compensation to a woman of "immaculate reputation" if a man broke off his [[engagement]] (or caused it to be broken off e.g. through unfaithfulness) after having had [[sexual intercourse]] with her. Immaculate reputation in this context meant mainly [[virginity]], but could also be lost though other factors such as being convicted of a crime.

The loss of virginity, it was assumed, would diminish the woman's expectations to gain a good [[matchmaking|match]] for a [[husband]]. Thus, the money is a form of legal [[damages]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://dictionary.reverso.net/german-english/kranzgeld Kranzgeld]. Reverso Dictionary. Accessed May 19, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

The term refers to the [[wreath]] that a [[bride]] traditionally wears at her [[wedding]]. In some European cultures, notably Germany, a virgin bride was entitled to wear a wreath of [[Myrtus|myrtle]] flowers; a non-virgin bride, on the other hand, had to wear a wreath made of [[straw]].

In [[Germany]], ''Kranzgeld'' was regulated in paragraph §1300 of the [[family law]], part of the [[civil code]] ''[[Bürgerliches Gesetzbuch]]'' published in 1896 and taking effect in 1900. After being long considered irrelevant, it was finally abolished on May 4, 1998, when the entire law was renewed, on the occasion of a [[trial]] in 1993 where the [[judge]]s decided the law was outdated. A woman had then tried to sue for 1000 [[German mark|DM]] (in 2004, roughly €500 or $500), but the request was denied on the grounds of [[Gender equality|equal rights]] between man and woman.

'''Herbert Marcuse''' ({{IPAc-en|m|ɑːr|ˈ|k|uː|z|ə}}; {{IPA-de|maɐ̯ˈkuːzə|lang}}; July 19, 1898 – July 29, 1979) was a German-American [[philosophy|philosopher]], [[sociology|sociologist]], and [[political philosophy|political theorist]], associated with the [[Frankfurt School]] of [[critical theory|Critical Theory]]. Born in [[Berlin]], Marcuse studied at the [[University of Berlin|universities of Berlin]] and then at [[University of Freiburg|Freiburg]], where he received his PhD.&lt;ref&gt;Lemert, Charles. Social Theory: The Multicultural and Classic Readings. Westview Press, Boulder, CO. 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; He was a prominent figure in the Frankfurt-based [[Institute for Social Research]] – what later became known as the [[Frankfurt School]]. He was married to Sophie Wertheim (1924–1951), Inge Neumann (1955–1973), and Erica Sherover (1976–1979).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.marcuse.org/herbert/people/sophie/sophie.htm |title=Sophie Wertheim (1901–1951) |publisher=Marcuse.org |date= |accessdate=2013-09-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.marcuse.org/herbert/people/inge/inge.htm |title=Inge Neumann (1913–1973) |publisher=Marcuse.org |date= |accessdate=2018-07-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.marcuse.org/herbert/people/ricky/ricky.htm |title=Erica Sherover-Marcuse (1938–1988) |publisher=Marcuse.org |date= |accessdate=2013-09-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; In his written works, he criticized [[capitalism]], modern technology, [[historical materialism]] and entertainment culture, arguing that they represent new forms of [[social control]].&lt;ref&gt;Mann, Douglas. "A Survey of Modern Social Theory". Oxford University Press. 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

Between 1943 and 1950, Marcuse worked in US government service for the [[Office of Strategic Services]] (predecessor of the [[Central Intelligence Agency]]) where he criticized the [[ideology of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union]] in the book ''[[Soviet Marxism: A Critical Analysis]]'' (1958). After his studies, in the 1960s and the 1970s he became known as the preeminent theorist of the [[New Left]] and the student movements of [[West Germany]], France, and the United States; some consider him the "father of the New Left".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=DKs0DwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT177|page=177|title=The End of the Experiment: The Rise of Cultural Elites and the Decline of America's Civic Culture|first=Stanley|last=Rothman|publisher=Routledge|year=2017|isbn=9781351295628}}&lt;/ref&gt;

His best known works are ''[[Eros and Civilization]]'' (1955) and ''[[One-Dimensional Man]]'' (1964). His [[Marxism|Marxist]] scholarship inspired many radical intellectuals and political activists in the 1960s and 1970s, both in the United States and internationally.  He viewed the integration of [[Eros (concept)|Eros]] and ''[[Logos]]'' to be the liberation of society.&lt;ref name=marcuse64&gt;[https://www.marcuse.org/herbert/pubs/64onedim/odm6.html Marcuse 1964]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=eroscivil /&gt;&lt;ref name=SEP&gt;[https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/marcuse/ ''SEP'']&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | url=https://books.google.com/?id=kApRDAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA4&amp;lpg=PA4&amp;dq=marcuse+eros+and+logos#v=onepage&amp;q=marcuse%20eros%20and%20logos&amp;f=false | title=Eros and Revolution: The Critical Philosophy of Herbert Marcuse| isbn=9789004308701| last1=Castro| first1=Javier Sethness| date=2016-06-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Biography==

===Early life===
Herbert Marcuse was born July 19, 1898, in [[Berlin]], to Carl Marcuse and Gertrud Kreslawsky. His family was [[Jewish]]. In 1916 he was drafted into the [[German Army (German Empire)|German Army]], but only worked in horse stables in Berlin during [[World War I]]. He then became a member of a Soldiers' Council that participated in the aborted [[socialism|socialist]] [[Spartacist uprising]]. He completed his PhD thesis at the [[University of Freiburg]] in 1922 on the German ''[[Künstlerroman]]'' after which he moved back to Berlin, where he worked in publishing. In 1924 he married Sophie Wertheim, a mathematician. He returned to [[Freiburg]] in 1928 to study with [[Edmund Husserl]] and write a [[habilitation]] with [[Martin Heidegger]], which was published in 1932 as ''[[Hegel's Ontology and the Theory of Historicity]]'' (''Hegels Ontologie und die Theorie der Geschichtlichkeit''). This study was written in the context of the Hegel renaissance that was taking place in Europe with an emphasis on [[Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel]]'s ontology of life and history, idealist theory of spirit and dialectic.&lt;ref name=kellner12&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.uta.edu/huma/illuminations/kell12.htm|title=Illuminations: Kellner|author=Douglas Kellner|accessdate=October 1, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; With his academic career blocked by the rise of the [[Third Reich]], in 1933 Marcuse joined the [[Institute for Social Research]], popularly known as the [[Frankfurt School]], in 1932. He went almost at once into exile with them, first briefly in [[Geneva]], then in the [[United States]]. Unlike some others, Marcuse did not return to [[Germany]] after the war, and when he visited Frankfurt in 1956, the young [[Jürgen Habermas]] was surprised to discover that he was a key member of the Institute.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books/about/Social_Theory.html?id=sf93K6SYMxIC |title=Social Theory: The Multicultural and Classic Readings|author=Lemert, Charles|publisher=Westview Press|year=2009|isbn=9780786749577}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1933, Marcuse published his first major review, of [[Karl Marx]]'s ''[[Economic and Philosophic Manuscripts of 1844]]''. In this review, Marcuse revised the interpretation of [[Marxism]], from the standpoint of the works of the early Marx.&lt;ref name=kellner12 /&gt;

While a member of the Institute of Social Research, Marcuse developed a model for critical social theory, created a theory of the new stage of state and monopoly capitalism, described the relationships between philosophy, social theory, and cultural criticism, and provided an analysis and critique of German fascism. Marcuse worked closely with critical theorists while at the institute.&lt;ref name=kellner12 /&gt;

===Emigration to the United States===
After emigrating from Germany in 1933, Marcuse immigrated to the United States in 1934, where he became a citizen in 1940. Although he never returned to Germany to live, he remained one of the major theorists associated with the Frankfurt School, along with [[Max Horkheimer]] and [[Theodor W. Adorno]] (among others). In 1940 he published ''Reason and Revolution'', a dialectical work studying [[G. W. F. Hegel]] and [[Karl Marx]].

===World War II===

During World War II, Marcuse first worked for the US [[Office of War Information]] (OWI) on anti-Nazi propaganda projects. In 1943, he transferred to the [[Research and Analysis Branch]] of the [[Office of Strategic Services]] (OSS), the precursor to the [[Central Intelligence Agency]].

Directed by the Harvard historian [[William L. Langer]], the Research and Analysis Branch was in fact the biggest American research institution in the first half of the twentieth century. At its zenith between 1943 and 1945, it comprised over twelve hundred employees, four hundred of whom were stationed abroad. In many respects, it was the site where post–World War II American social science was born, with protégés of some of the most esteemed American university professors, as well as a large contingent of European intellectual émigrés, in its ranks.

These men comprised the "theoretical brain trust" of the American war machine, which, according to its founder, [[William J. Donovan]], would function as a "final clearinghouse" for the secret services—that is, as a structure that, although not engaged in determining war strategy or tactics, would be able to assemble, organize, analyze, and filter the immense flow of military information directed toward Washington, thanks to the unique capacity of the specialists on hand to interpret the relevant sources.&lt;ref&gt;Secret Reports on Nazi Germany. The Frankfurt School Contribution to the War Effort by [[Franz Leopold Neumann|Franz Neumann]], Herbert Marcuse &amp; [[Otto Kirchheimer]] Edited by Raffaele Laudani (Princeton University Press 2013) p. 2&lt;/ref&gt;

In March 1943, Marcuse joined his fellow [[Frankfurt School]] scholar [[Franz Leopold Neumann|Franz Neumann]] in R &amp; A's Central European Section as senior analyst and rapidly established himself as "the leading analyst on Germany.&lt;ref&gt;Laudani, Secret Reports p3&lt;/ref&gt;

After the dissolution of the OSS in 1945, Marcuse was employed by the [[US Department of State]] as head of the Central European section, retiring after the death of his first wife in 1951.

===Post-war===
In 1952, Marcuse began a teaching career as a political theorist, first at [[Columbia University]], then at [[Harvard University]]. Marcuse worked at [[Brandeis University]] from 1958 to 1965, then at the [[University of California San Diego]] until his retirement. It was during his time at [[Brandeis University]] that he wrote his most famous work, ''[[One-Dimensional Man]]'' (1964).&lt;ref&gt;Elliott, Anthony and Larry Ray. Key Contemporary Social Theorists. Blackwell Publishers. 2003.&lt;/ref&gt;

Marcuse was a friend and collaborator of the [[political sociology|political sociologist]] [[Barrington Moore Jr.]] and of the political philosopher [[Robert Paul Wolff]], and also a friend of the [[Columbia University]] sociology professor [[C. Wright Mills]], one of the founders of the [[New Left]] movement.  In his "Introduction" to ''One-Dimensional Man'', Marcuse wrote, "I should like to emphasize the vital importance of the work of C. Wright Mills."&lt;ref&gt;''One-Dimensional  Man (Boston: Beacon Press, 1964), p. xvii&lt;/ref&gt;

In the post-war period, Marcuse rejected the theory of [[class struggle]] and the Marxist concern with labor, instead claiming, according to [[Leszek Kołakowski]], that since "all questions of material existence have been solved, moral commands and prohibitions are no longer relevant." He regarded the realization of man's erotic nature as the true liberation of humanity, which inspired the utopias of [[Jerry Rubin]] and others.&lt;ref name="Kołakowski 1981 416"&gt;{{cite book|last=Kołakowski|first=Leszek|authorlink=Leszek Kołakowski|title=Main Currents Of Marxism: Volume III, The Breakdown|year=1981|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0192851093|page=416}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Marcuse's critiques of [[capitalism|capitalist]] society (especially his 1955 synthesis of Marx and [[Sigmund Freud]], ''[[Eros and Civilization]]'', and his 1964 book ''[[One-Dimensional Man]]'') resonated with the concerns of the student movement in the 1960s. Because of his willingness to speak at student protests and his essay ''[[Repressive Tolerance]]'' (1965),&lt;ref name=kellner12 /&gt; Marcuse soon became known in the media as "Father of the New Left."&lt;ref name=kellner12 /&gt;&lt;ref name=marcuseweb /&gt;  Contending that the students of the sixties were not waiting for the publication of his work to act,&lt;ref name=marcuseweb&gt;[http://www.marcuse.org/herbert/booksabout/70s/Bourne1979MarcuseGrandfatherNewLeft.pdf Tom Bourne (Sept. 1979)]&lt;/ref&gt; Marcuse brushed the media's branding of him as "Father of the New Left" aside lightly,&lt;ref name=marcuseweb /&gt; saying "It would have been better to call me not the father, but the grandfather, of the New Left."&lt;ref name=marcuseweb /&gt;  His work heavily influenced intellectual discourse on [[popular culture]] and scholarly [[popular culture studies]]. He had many speaking engagements in the US and [[Western Bloc]] in the late 1960s and 1970s. He became a close friend and inspirer of the French philosopher [[André Gorz]].

Marcuse defended the arrested [[East Germany|East German]] dissident [[Rudolf Bahro]] (author of ''Die Alternative: Zur Kritik des real existierenden Sozialismus'' [trans., ''The Alternative in Eastern Europe'']), discussing in a 1979 essay Bahro's theories of "change from within."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Stefan Meretz |url=http://www.opentheory.org/marcuse_ueber_bahro/text.phtml |title=open theory · offene theorie: Protosozialismus und Spätkapitalismus.

===The New Left and radical politics===

He characterizes tolerance of repressive speech as "inauthentic". Instead, he advocates a form of tolerance that is intolerant of repressive (namely right-wing) political movements:

{{quote|Liberating tolerance, then, would mean intolerance against movements from the Right and toleration of movements from the Left.

Surely, no government can be expected to foster its own subversion, but in a democracy such a right is vested in the people (i.e. in the majority of the people). This means that the ways should not be blocked on which a subversive majority could develop, and if they are blocked by organized repression and indoctrination, their reopening may require apparently undemocratic means. They would include the withdrawal of toleration of speech and assembly from groups and movements that promote aggressive policies, armament, chauvinism, discrimination on the grounds of race and religion, or that oppose the extension of public services, social security, medical care, etc.&lt;ref name="marcuse.org"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.marcuse.org/herbert/pubs/60spubs/65repressivetolerance.htm |title=Repressive Tolerance, by Herbert Marcuse (1965) |publisher=Marcuse.org |date= |accessdate=2013-09-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Marcuse later expressed his radical ideas through three pieces of writing. He wrote ''[[An Essay on Liberation]]'' in 1969, in which he celebrated liberation movements such as those in [[Vietnam]], which inspired many radicals. In 1972 he wrote ''[[Counterrevolution and Revolt]]'', which argues that the hopes of the 1960s were facing a counterrevolution from the right.&lt;ref name=kellner12 /&gt;

After Brandeis denied the renewal of his teaching contract in 1965, Marcuse taught at the [[University of California San Diego]] until his retirement and devoted the rest of his life to teaching, writing and giving lectures around the world. His efforts brought him attention from the media, which claimed that he openly advocated violence, although he often clarified that only "violence of defense" could be appropriate, not "violence of aggression". He continued to promote Marxian theory, with some of his students helping to spread his ideas. He published his final work ''[[The Aesthetic Dimension]]'' in 1979 on the role of art in the process of what he termed "emancipation" from bourgeois society.&lt;ref name=kellner12 /&gt;

===Marriages===
[[Image:Grave-of-Herbert-Marcuse.jpg|thumb|Grave in the [[Dorotheenstädtischer cemetery]], Berlin, where Marcuse's ashes were buried in 2003]]

Marcuse married three times. His first wife was [[mathematician]] Sophie Wertheim (1901–1951), with whom he had a son, Peter (born 1928). Herbert's second marriage was to Inge Neumann (1910–1973), the widow of his close friend [[Franz Leopold Neumann|Franz Neumann]] (1900–1954). His third wife was Erica Sherover (1938–1988), a former graduate student and forty years his junior, whom he married in 1976. His son [[Peter Marcuse]] is professor emeritus of [[urban planning]] at [[Columbia University]]. His granddaughter is the novelist [[Irene Marcuse]] and his grandson, [[Harold Marcuse]], is a professor of history at the [[University of California, Santa Barbara]].

===Death===
On July 29, 1979, ten days after his eighty-first birthday, Marcuse died after suffering a [[stroke]] during a visit to Germany. He had spoken at the Frankfurt ''Römerberggespräche'', and was on his way to the [[Max Planck Society#Former institutes|Max Planck Institute for the Study of the Scientific-Technical World]] in Starnberg, on invitation from second-generation Frankfurt School theorist [[Jürgen Habermas]]. In 2003, after his ashes were rediscovered in the United States, they were buried in the [[Dorotheenstädtischer cemetery]] in Berlin.

==Philosophy and views==
Marcuse's famous concept [[repressive desublimation]] refers to his argument that postwar mass culture, with its profusion of sexual provocations, serves to reinforce political repression. If people are preoccupied with inauthentic sexual stimulation, their political energy will be "desublimated"; instead of acting constructively to change the world, they remain repressed and uncritical. Marcuse advanced the prewar thinking of critical theory toward a critical account of the "one-dimensional" nature of bourgeois life in Europe and America. His thinking could, therefore, also be considered an advance of the concerns of earlier liberal critics such as [[David Riesman]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books/about/Key_Contemporary_Social_Theorists.html?id=fTowST-_gmYC |title=Key Contemporary Social Theorists – Google Books|date= 2002-10-22|accessdate=2013-09-06|isbn=9780631219729|last1=Elliott|first1=Anthony|last2=Ray|first2=Larry}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Much of Marcuse's philosophy was centered around the belief that [[Eros (concept)|Eros]] had to integrate with ''[[Logos]]'' in order to strive.&lt;ref&gt;[http://freudians.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/Marcuse-Eros-and-Civilization-Part-I-Under-the-Rule-of-the-Reality-Principle1.pdf freudians.org]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://footnotes2plato.com/2011/03/25/psychoanalysis-and-philosophy-towards-the-eroticization-of-logos/ footnotes2plato.com]&lt;/ref&gt; Marcuse defended Plato's argument that while Eros was constructive, ''Logos'' was superior and would eventually absorb it.&lt;ref name=eroscivil&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=autxu8JMA1gC&amp;pg=PA106#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|title=Eros and Civilization|author=Herbert Marcuse|publisher=Beacon Press|page=125–126|date=1955|accessdate=September 1, 2018|isbn=9780807015551}}&lt;/ref&gt; In ''One Dimensional Man'', he argued that ''Logos'' would also liberate's one's gratification.&lt;ref name=marcuse64 /&gt;

Two aspects of Marcuse's work are of particular importance, first, his use of language more familiar from the critique of Soviet or Nazi regimes to characterize developments in the advanced industrial world; and second, his grounding of critical theory in a particular use of psychoanalytic thought. Both of these features of his thinking have often been misunderstood and have given rise to critiques of his work that miss the point of his targets.&lt;ref&gt;Elliot, Anthony and Larry Ray. Key Contemporary Social Theorists. Blackwell Publishing. 2003.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Marcuse's early "Heideggerian Marxism"===
During his years in Freiburg, Marcuse wrote a series of essays that explored the possibility of synthesizing Marxism and Heidegger's fundamental ontology, as begun in the latter's work ''Being and Time'' (1927). This early interest in Heidegger followed Marcuse's demand for "concrete philosophy," which, he declared in 1928, "concerns itself with the truth of contemporaneous human existence."&lt;ref&gt;Marcuse, Herbert. "On Concrete Philosophy." 1929. In Heideggerian Marxism. Eds. John Abromeit and Richard Wolin. Lincoln, Nebraska: University of Nebraska Press, 2005. p. 49.&lt;/ref&gt; These words were directed against the neo-Kantianism of the mainstream, and against both the revisionist and orthodox Marxist alternatives, in which the subjectivity of the individual played little role.&lt;ref&gt;For a thorough discussion of Marcuse's perspectives on the Marxisms of his day, see Benhabib's introduction to Hegel's Ontology. (Marcuse, Herbert. Hegel's Ontology and the Theory of Historicity. 1932. Trans. Seyla Benhabib. Cambridge, MA: MIT Press, 1987. pp. xi–xix.)&lt;/ref&gt; Though Marcuse quickly distanced himself from Heidegger following Heidegger's endorsement of Nazism, it has been suggested by thinkers such as [[Jürgen Habermas]] that an understanding of Marcuse's later thinking demands an appreciation of his early Heideggerian influence.&lt;ref&gt;See, e.g., Marcuse, Herbert. ''Heideggerian Marxism'', edited by Richard Wolin and John Abromeit, Lincoln: University of Nebraska Press, 2005, pp. xi–xxx.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Marcuse and capitalism===
Marcuse's analysis of capitalism derives partially from one of Karl Marx's main concepts: Objectification,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.marxists.org/glossary/terms/o/b.htm#objectification |title=Glossary of Terms: Ob |publisher=Marxists.org |date= |accessdate=2013-09-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; which under capitalism becomes Alienation. Marx believed that capitalism was exploiting humans; that by producing objects of a certain character, laborers became alienated and this ultimately dehumanized them into functional objects themselves. Marcuse took this belief and expanded it. He argued that capitalism and industrialization pushed laborers so hard that they began to see themselves as extensions of the objects they were producing. At the beginning of ''One-Dimensional Man'' Marcuse writes, "The people recognize themselves in their commodities; they find their soul in their automobile, hi-fi set, split-level home, kitchen equipment,"&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.marcuse.org/herbert/quotes/QuotRedThread.html#Capitalism marcuse.org (quotations)]&lt;/ref&gt; meaning that under capitalism (in consumer society) humans become extensions of the commodities that they buy, thus making commodities extensions of people's minds and bodies. Affluent mass technological societies, he argues, are totally controlled and manipulated. In societies based upon mass production and mass distribution, the individual worker has become merely a consumer of its commodities and entire commodified way of life. Modern Capitalism has created false needs and false consciousness geared to consumption of [[commodities]]: it locks one-dimensional man into the one-dimensional society which produced the need for people to recognize themselves in their commodities.&lt;ref name="Stuart Sim 1997"&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books/about/The_A_Z_guide_to_modern_social_and_polit.html?id=_1mFAAAAMAAJ |title=The A–Z Guide to Modern Social and Political Theorists |publisher=Prentice-Hall|year=1997|authors=Parker, Noel; Sim, Stuart|isbn=9780135248850 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The very mechanism that ties the individual to his society has changed and social control is anchored in the new needs which it has produced. Most important of all, the pressure of consumerism has led to the total integration of the working class into the [[capitalism|capitalist]] system. Its political parties and trade unions have become thoroughly bureaucratized and the power of [[Negative dialectics|negative thinking]] or critical reflection has rapidly declined.&lt;ref name=SEP/&gt; The working class is no longer a potentially subversive force capable of bringing about revolutionary change. As a result, rather than looking to the workers as the revolutionary vanguard, Marcuse put his faith in an alliance between radical intellectuals and those groups not yet integrated into one-dimensional society, the socially marginalized, the substratum of the outcasts and outsiders, the exploited and persecuted of other ethnicities and other colors, the unemployed and the unemployable. These were the people whose standards of living demanded the ending of intolerable conditions and institutions and whose resistance to one-dimensional society would not be diverted by the system. Their opposition was revolutionary even if their consciousness was not.&lt;ref name="Stuart Sim 1997"&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books/about/The_A_Z_guide_to_modern_social_and_polit.html?id=_1mFAAAAMAAJ |title=The A–Z Guide to Modern Social and Political Theorists |publisher=Prentice-Hall|year=1997|authors=Parker, Noel; Sim, Stuart|isbn=9780135248850 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criticism==
[[Leszek Kołakowski]] described Marcuse's views as essentially anti-Marxist, in that they ignored Marx's critique of Hegel and discarded the historical theory of [[class struggle]] entirely in favor of an inverted Freudian reading of human history where all social rules could and should be discarded to create a "New World of Happiness." Kołakowski concluded that Marcuse's ideal society "is to be ruled despotically by an enlightened group [who] have realized in themselves the unity of ''Logos'' and Eros, and thrown off the vexatious authority of logic, mathematics, and the empirical sciences."&lt;ref name="Kołakowski 1981 416"/&gt;

The philosopher [[Alasdair MacIntyre]] asserted that almost all of Marcuse's key positions are false and that his generalizations were based upon the total absence of any account of contemporary social structure. Featherstone criticized his portrayal of modern consumerism: it falsely assumed that consumers were completely passive, uncritically responding to corporate advertising.&lt;ref name="Stuart Sim 1997"/&gt;

==Legacy==

Herbert Marcuse appealed to students of the New Left through his emphasis on the power of critical thought and his vision of total human emancipation and a non-repressive civilization. He supported students he felt were subject to the pressures of a commodifying system, and has been regarded as an inspirational intellectual leader.&lt;ref name="Stuart Sim 1997"/&gt; He is also considered among the most influential of the Frankfurt School critical theorists on North American culture, due to his studies on student and counter-cultural movements on the 1960s.&lt;ref&gt;Mann, Douglas. A Survey of Modern Social Theory. Oxford University Press. 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; The legacy of the 1960s, of which Marcuse was a vital part, lives on, and the [[Great Refusal]] is still practiced by oppositional groups and individuals who refuse to conform to the existing systems of oppression and domination.&lt;ref name="Stuart Sim 1997"/&gt;

Wolf von Laer, in a podcast titled ''Campus Speech and the Libertarian Student Movement'', cites the influence of Marcuse as an unacknowledged source for the disruptive tactics of the "New Left" on today's campuses.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.cato.org/multimedia/cato-daily-podcast/campus-speech-libertarian-student-movement cato.org]&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''history of nanotechnology''' traces the development of the concepts and experimental work falling under the broad category of [[nanotechnology]].  Although nanotechnology is a relatively recent development in scientific research, the development of its central  concepts happened over a longer period of time.  The emergence of nanotechnology in the 1980s was caused by the convergence of experimental advances such as the invention of the [[scanning tunneling microscope]] in 1981 and the discovery of [[fullerene]]s in 1985, with the elucidation and popularization of a conceptual framework for the goals of nanotechnology beginning with the 1986 publication of the book ''[[Engines of Creation]]''.  The field was subject to growing public awareness and controversy in the early 2000s, with prominent debates about both its [[Implications of nanotechnology|potential implications]] as well as the feasibility of the applications envisioned by advocates of [[molecular nanotechnology]], and with governments moving to promote and [[Funding of science|fund research]] into nanotechnology.  The early 2000s also saw the beginnings of commercial [[List of nanotechnology applications|applications of nanotechnology]], although these were limited to bulk applications of [[nanomaterials]] rather than the [[Disruptive technology|transformative]] applications envisioned by the field. .

== Early uses of nanomaterials ==
The earliest evidence of the use and applications of nanotechnology can be traced back to [[carbon nanotubes]], [[cementite]] [[nanowires]] found in the microstructure of [[wootz steel]] manufactured in ancient India from the time period of 600 BC and exported globally.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Sanderson, Katharine |url=http://www.nature.com/news/2006/061113/full/news061113-11.html |title=Sharpest cut from nanotube sword |journal=Nature News |date=2006-11-15 |doi=10.1038/news061113-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although nanoparticles are associated with modern science, they were used by [[artisan]]s as far back as the ninth century in [[Mesopotamia]] for creating a [[Lusterware|glittering]] effect on the surface of pots.&lt;ref name="reiss"&gt;{{cite book|chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=DiFMPmXSsLUC&amp;pg=SA2-PA1|title=Handbook of Nanophysics: Nanoparticles and Quantum Dots|last2=Hutten|first2=Andreas|publisher=CRC Press|year=2010|isbn=9781420075458|editor-last=Sattler|editor-first=Klaus D.|pages=2–1|chapter=Magnetic Nanoparticles|last1=Reiss|first1=Gunter}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="khan"&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=-s5oRDUuMSIC&amp;pg=PA328|title=Biotechnology Fundamentals|last=Khan|first=Firdos Alam|publisher=CRC Press|year=2012|isbn=9781439820094|page=328}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In modern times, [[pottery]] from the [[Middle Ages]] and [[Renaissance]] often retains a distinct gold- or copper-colored metallic glitter. This [[Lusterware|luster]] is caused by a metallic film that was applied to the transparent surface of a [[Glazing (window)|glazing]], which contains [[silver nanoparticle|silver]] and [[copper nanoparticle]]s dispersed homogeneously in the glassy matrix of the ceramic glaze. These nanoparticles are created by the artisans by adding [[copper]] and [[silver]] [[salt (chemistry)|salt]]s and [[oxide]]s together with [[vinegar]], [[ochre]], and [[clay]] on the surface of previously-glazed pottery. The technique originated in the [[Muslim world]]. As Muslims were not allowed to use gold in artistic representations, they sought a way to create a similar effect without using real gold. The solution they found was using luster.&lt;ref name="khan" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=1e79xqbRqEEC&amp;pg=PA150|title=Ceramics|publisher=University of Pennsylvania Press|year=1984|isbn=978-0-8122-1156-6|author=Rawson, Philip S.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Conceptual origins ==
===Richard Feynman===
{{main article|There's Plenty of Room at the Bottom}}
[[File:Feynman at Los Alamos.jpg|thumb|Richard Feynman gave a 1959 talk which many years later inspired the conceptual foundations of nanotechnology.]]

The American [[physicist]] [[Richard Feynman]] lectured, "[[There's Plenty of Room at the Bottom]]," at an [[American Physical Society]] meeting at [[Caltech]] on December 29, 1959, which is often held to have provided inspiration for the field of [[nanotechnology]]. Feynman had described a process by which the ability to manipulate individual atoms and molecules might be developed, using one set of precise tools to build and operate another proportionally smaller set, so on down to the needed scale. In the course of this, he noted, scaling issues would arise from the changing magnitude of various physical phenomena: gravity would become less important, [[surface tension]] and [[Van der Waals force|Van der Waals attraction]] would become more important.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Gribbin |first1=John |last2= Gribbin |first2=Mary |title=Richard Feynman: A Life in Science |publisher=Dutton |year=1997 |page=170 |isbn= 978-0-452-27631-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After Feynman's death, scholars studying the historical development of nanotechnology have concluded that his actual role in catalyzing nanotechnology research was limited, based on recollections from many of the people active in the nascent field in the 1980s and 1990s. [http://www.christoumey.org/ Chris Toumey], a [[cultural anthropologist]] at the [[University of South Carolina]], found that the published versions of Feynman’s talk had a negligible influence in the twenty years after it was first published, as measured by citations in the scientific literature, and not much more influence in the decade after the [[Scanning Tunneling Microscope]] was invented in 1981.  Subsequently, interest in “Plenty of Room” in the scientific literature greatly increased in the early 1990s.  This is probably because the term “nanotechnology” gained serious attention just before that time, following its use by [[K. Eric Drexler]] in his 1986 book, [[Engines of Creation|''Engines of Creation: The Coming Era of Nanotechnology'']], which took the Feynman concept of a billion tiny factories and added the idea that they could make more copies of themselves via computer control instead of control by a human operator; and in a cover article headlined "Nanotechnology",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first= Fred |last=Hapgood |date=November 1986|title= "Nanotechnology" / "Tinytech" | page= 56 |journal=Omni}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Drexler|first=Eric|title=The promise that launched the field of nanotechnology|url=http://metamodern.com/2009/12/15/when-a-million-readers-first-encountered-nanotechnology/|publisher=Metamodern: The Trajectory of Technology|accessdate=13 May 2011|date=15 December 2009|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110714075738/http://metamodern.com/2009/12/15/when-a-million-readers-first-encountered-nanotechnology/|archivedate=14 July 2011|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; published later that year in a mass-circulation science-oriented magazine, ''[[Omni (magazine)|Omni]]''.  Toumey’s analysis also includes comments from distinguished scientists in nanotechnology who say that “Plenty of Room” did not influence their early work, and in fact most of them had not read it until a later date.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first=Chris |last=Toumey |title=Apostolic Succession |journal=Engineering &amp; Science |volume=1/2 |year=2005 |pages=16–23|url=http://calteches.library.caltech.edu/4129/1/Succession.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first=Chris |last=Toumey |url=http://scholar.lib.vt.edu/ejournals/SPT/v12n3/toumey.pdf |title=Reading Feynman into Nanotechnology: A Text for a New Science |journal=Techné |volume=13 |issue=3 |year=2008 |pages=133–168 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090919171108/http://scholar.lib.vt.edu/ejournals/SPT/v12n3/toumey.pdf |archivedate=2009-09-19 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

These and other developments hint that the retroactive rediscovery of Feynman’s “Plenty of Room” gave nanotechnology a packaged history that provided an early date of December 1959, plus a connection to the charisma and genius of Richard Feynman. Feynman's stature as a Nobel laureate and as an iconic figure in 20th century science surely helped advocates of nanotechnology and provided a valuable intellectual link to the past.&lt;ref name=Milburn&gt;{{cite book |first=Colin |last=Milburn |title=Nanovision: Engineering the Future |publisher=Duke University Press |year=2008 |isbn=978-0-8223-4265-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Norio Taniguchi===
{{main article|Norio Taniguchi}}

The Japanese scientist called Norio Taniguchi of [[Tokyo University of Science]] was        first to use the term "nano-technology" in a 1974 conference,&lt;ref name = "Taniguchi"&gt;{{cite journal |first=Norio |last=Taniguchi |title=On the Basic Concept of 'Nano-Technology' |journal=Proceedings of the International Conference on Production Engineering, Tokyo, 1974, Part II |year=1974}}&lt;/ref&gt; to describe semiconductor processes such as thin film deposition and ion beam milling exhibiting characteristic control on the order of a nanometer.  His definition was, "'Nano-technology' mainly consists of the processing of, separation, consolidation, and deformation of materials by one atom or one molecule."  However, the term was not used again until 1981 when Eric Drexler, who was unaware of Taniguchi's prior use of the term, published his first paper on nanotechnology in 1981.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|editor1-last=Guston|editor1-first=David H.|title=Encyclopedia of nanoscience and society|date=2010|publisher=SAGE|location=London|isbn=9781452266176|page=747|chapter-url={{Google books|vyp1AwAAQBAJ||page=747|plainurl=true}}|accessdate=3 August 2014|chapter=Taniguchi, Norio|first=Deborah R.|last=Bassett}}&lt;!--alt url: https://catalyst.uw.edu/workspace/file/download/1c6f06663d588d421e4eafcee2e159803734b0f3b6968be73bb6cee1c0fa55eb --&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Koodali|first1=Ranjit T.|last2=Klabunde|first2=Kenneth J.|editor1-last=Kent|editor1-first=James A.|title=Handbook of industrial chemistry and biotechnology, volume 1|date=2012|publisher=Springer|location=New York|isbn=9781461442592|page=250|edition=12th|chapter-url={{Google books|7VxDAAAAQBAJ||page=250|plainurl=true}}|accessdate=3 August 2014|chapter=Nanotechnology: Fandamental Principles and Applications}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Maynard|first1=edited by Graeme A.

===K. Eric Drexler===
[[File:Eric Drexler 2007.jpg|thumb|K. Eric Drexler developed and popularized the concept of nanotechnology and founded the field of [[molecular nanotechnology]].]]
{{main article|Eric Drexler}}

In the 1980s the idea of nanotechnology as a [[deterministic]], rather than [[stochastic]], handling of individual atoms and molecules was conceptually explored in depth by K. Eric Drexler, who promoted the technological significance of nano-scale phenomena and devices through speeches and two influential books.
 
In 1980, Drexler encountered Feynman's provocative 1959 talk "There's Plenty of Room at the Bottom" while preparing his initial scientific paper on the subject, “Molecular Engineering: An approach to the development of general capabilities for molecular manipulation,” published in the ''Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences'' in 1981.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|pmc=348724 |year=1981 |author1=Drexler |first1=K.

He also first published the term "[[grey goo]]" to describe what might happen if a hypothetical self-replicating machine, capable of independent operation, were constructed and released.  Drexler's vision of nanotechnology is often called "[[Molecular Nanotechnology]]" (MNT) or "molecular manufacturing."

His 1991 Ph.D. work at the [[MIT Media Lab]] was the first doctoral degree on the topic of molecular nanotechnology and (after some editing) his thesis, "Molecular Machinery and Manufacturing with Applications to Computation,"&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite thesis |degree=Ph.D. |chapter= |title=Molecular Machinery and Manufacturing with Applications to Computation |url=http://dspace.mit.edu/bitstream/1721.1/27999/1/25696817.pdf |last=Drexler |first=K.

== Experimental advances ==

Nanotechnology and [[nanoscience]] got a boost in the early 1980s with two major developments: the birth of [[Cluster (physics)|cluster]] science and the invention of the [[scanning tunneling microscope]] (STM). These developments led to the discovery of [[fullerenes]] in 1985 and the structural assignment of [[carbon nanotubes]] a few years later

===Invention of scanning probe microscopy===
{{double image|right|Gerd Binnig sw.jpg|175|Rohrer.jpg|200|Gerd Binnig (left) and Heinrich Rohrer (right) won the 1986 Nobel Prize in Physics for their 1981 invention of the [[scanning tunneling microscope]].}}

The [[scanning tunneling microscope]], an instrument for imaging surfaces at the atomic level, was developed in 1981 by [[Gerd Binnig]] and [[Heinrich Rohrer]] at [[IBM Zurich Research Laboratory]], for which they were awarded the [[Nobel Prize in Physics]] in 1986.&lt;ref name="Binnig"&gt;{{Cite journal|first1=G. |last1=Binnig |first2=H. |last2=Rohrer|title=Scanning tunneling microscopy|journal=IBM Journal of Research and Development|volume=30|issue=4|year=1986|pages=355–69}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Press Release: the 1996 Nobel Prize in Physics|url=http://nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/physics/laureates/1986/press.html|publisher=Nobelprize.org|accessdate=12 May 2011|date=15 October 1986}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Binnig, [[Calvin Quate]] and [[Christoph Gerber]] invented the first [[atomic force microscope]] in 1986. The first commercially available atomic force microscope was introduced in 1989.

[[IBM]] researcher [[Don Eigler]] was the first to manipulate atoms using a scanning tunneling microscope in 1989. He used 35 [[Xenon]] atoms to [[IBM (atoms)|spell out the IBM logo]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Shankland|first=Stephen|title=IBM's 35 atoms and the rise of nanotech|url=http://news.cnet.com/8301-30685_3-10362747-264.html|publisher=CNET|accessdate=12 May 2011|date=28 September 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;  He shared the 2010 [[Kavli Prize]] in Nanoscience for this work.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Kavli Prize Laureates 2010|url=http://www.kavliprize.no/seksjon/vis.html?tid=45348|publisher=The Norwegian Academy of Science and Letters|accessdate=13 May 2011|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110512070336/http://www.kavliprize.no/seksjon/vis.html?tid=45348|archivedate=12 May 2011|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Advances in interface and colloid science===
[[Interface and colloid science]] had existed for nearly a century before they became associated with nanotechnology.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Efremov |first=I.F. |chapter=Periodic Colloidal Structures |title=Surface and Colloid Science |volume=8 |publisher=Wiley |location=New York |editor=Matijevic, E. |year=1976 |chapter-url=https://www.springer.com/series/6505}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Lyklema |first=J. |title=Fundamentals of Interface and Colloid Science |publisher=Academic Press |year=2000 |url=http://www.elsevier.com/wps/find/bookdescription.agents/675463/description |isbn=978-0-12-460523-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The first observations and size measurements of nanoparticles had been made during the first decade of the 20th century by [[Richard Adolf Zsigmondy]], winner of the 1925 [[Nobel Prize in Chemistry]], who made a detailed study of gold sols and other [[nanomaterials]] with sizes down to 10&amp;nbsp;nm using an [[ultramicroscope]] which was capable of visualizing particles much smaller than the [[light]] [[wavelength]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Zsigmondy |first=R. |title=Colloids and the Ultramicroscope |publisher=J.Wiley and Sons |location=New York |year=1914 |url=https://archive.org/details/colloidsandultr00alexgoog |accessdate=10 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Zsigmondy was also the first to use the term "nanometer" explicitly for characterizing particle size.  In the 1920s, [[Irving Langmuir]], winner of the 1932 Nobel Prize in Chemistry, and [[Katharine B. Blodgett]] introduced the concept of a [[monolayer]], a layer of material one molecule thick.  In the early 1950s, Derjaguin and Abrikosova conducted the first measurement of surface forces.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1039/DF9541800024 |title=Investigations of the forces of interaction of surfaces in different media and their application to the problem of colloid stability |year=1954 |last1=Derjaguin |first1=B.

In 1974 the process of [[atomic layer deposition]] for depositing uniform thin films one atomic layer at a time was developed and patented by Tuomo Suntola and co-workers in Finland.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=History of Atomic Layer Deposition|url=http://www.fmnt.fi/index.pl?id=2913&amp;isa=Category&amp;op=show|publisher=Finnish Micro &amp; Nano Technology Network|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070928172218/http://www.fmnt.fi/index.pl?id=2913&amp;isa=Category&amp;op=show|archivedate=28 September 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In another development, the synthesis and properties of semiconductor [[nanocrystal]]s were studied. This led to a fast increasing number of [[semiconductor]] nanoparticles of [[quantum dots]].

===Discovery of fullerenes===

[[Fullerene]]s were discovered in 1985 by [[Harry Kroto]], [[Richard Smalley]], and [[Robert Curl]], who together won the 1996 [[Nobel Prize in Chemistry]].  Smalley's research in physical chemistry investigated formation of inorganic and semiconductor clusters using pulsed molecular beams and time of flight [[mass spectrometry]].  As a consequence of this expertise, Curl introduced him to Kroto in order to investigate a question about the constituents of astronomical dust.  These are carbon rich grains expelled by old stars such as R Corona Borealis. The result of this collaboration was the discovery of C&lt;sub&gt;60&lt;/sub&gt; and the fullerenes as the third [[allotropy|allotropic]] form of carbon.  Subsequent discoveries included the [[endohedral fullerenes]], and the larger family of fullerenes the following year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1038/318162a0 |title=C&lt;sub&gt;60&lt;/sub&gt;: Buckminsterfullerene |year=1985 |last1=Kroto |first1=H.

In the early 1990s Huffman and Kraetschmer, of the [[University of Arizona]], discovered how to synthesize and purify large quantities of fullerenes.  This opened the door to their characterization and functionalization by hundreds of investigators in government and industrial laboratories.  Shortly after, rubidium doped C&lt;sub&gt;60&lt;/sub&gt; was found to be a mid temperature (Tc = 32 K) superconductor.  At a meeting of the Materials Research Society in 1992, Dr. T. Ebbesen (NEC) described to a spellbound audience his discovery and characterization of carbon nanotubes.  This event sent those in attendance and others downwind of his presentation into their laboratories to reproduce and push those discoveries forward.  Using the same or similar tools as those used by Huffman and Kratschmer, hundreds of researchers further developed the field of nanotube-based nanotechnology.

===National Nanotechnology Initiative===
[[File:Mihail Roco.jpg|thumb|Mihail Roco of the [[National Science Foundation]] formally proposed the [[National Nanotechnology Initiative]] to the [[Executive Office of the President of the United States|White House]], and was a key architect in its initial development.]]

{{main article|National Nanotechnology Initiative}}

The National Nanotechnology Initiative is a [[United States]] federal nanotechnology [[research and development]] program. “The NNI serves as the central point of communication, cooperation, and collaboration for all Federal agencies engaged in nanotechnology research, bringing together the expertise needed to advance this broad and complex field."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=About the NNI {{!}} Nano|url=http://nano.gov/about-nni}}&lt;/ref&gt; Its goals are to advance a world-class nanotechnology research and development (R&amp;D) program, foster the transfer of new technologies into products for commercial and public benefit, develop and sustain educational resources, a skilled workforce, and the supporting infrastructure and tools to advance nanotechnology, and support responsible development of nanotechnology.  The initiative was spearheaded by [[Mihail Roco]], who formally proposed the National Nanotechnology Initiative to the [[Office of Science and Technology Policy]] during the Clinton administration in 1999, and was a key architect in its development.  He is currently the Senior Advisor for Nanotechnology at the [[National Science Foundation]], as well as the founding chair of the [[National Science and Technology Council]] subcommittee on Nanoscale Science, Engineering and Technology.&lt;ref&gt;

President [[Bill Clinton]] advocated [[nanotechnology]] development. In a 21 January 2000 speech&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=President Clinton's Address to Caltech on Science and Technology |url=http://marcomm.caltech.edu/events/presidential_speech/|publisher=California Institute of Technology|accessdate=13 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; at the [[California Institute of Technology]], Clinton said, "Some of our research goals may take twenty or more years to achieve, but that is precisely why there is an important role for the federal government."  Feynman's stature and concept of atomically precise fabrication played a role in securing funding for nanotechnology research, as mentioned in President Clinton's speech:

==Growing public awareness and controversy==

==="Why the future doesn't need us"===
{{main article|Why the future doesn't need us}}

"Why the future doesn't need us" is an article written by [[Bill Joy]], then Chief Scientist at [[Sun Microsystems]], in the April 2000 issue of ''[[Wired (magazine)|Wired]]'' magazine. In the article, he argues that "Our most powerful 21st-century technologies — [[robotics]], [[genetic engineering]], and [[nanotechnology|nanotech]] — are threatening to make humans an [[endangered species]]." Joy argues that developing technologies provide a much greater danger to humanity than any technology before it has ever presented. In particular, he focuses on [[genetics]], [[nanotechnology]] and [[robotics]]. He argues that 20th-century technologies of destruction, such as the [[nuclear bomb]], were limited to large governments, due to the complexity and cost of such devices, as well as the difficulty in acquiring the required materials. He also voices concern about increasing computer power. His worry is that computers will eventually become more intelligent than we are, leading to such [[dystopian]] scenarios as [[cybernetic revolt|robot rebellion]]. He notably quotes the [[Unabomber]] on this topic.  After the publication of the article, Bill Joy suggested assessing technologies to gauge their implicit dangers, as well as having scientists refuse to work on technologies that have the potential to cause harm.

In the [[American Association for the Advancement of Science|AAAS]] Science and Technology Policy Yearbook 2001 article titled ''A Response to Bill Joy and the Doom-and-Gloom Technofuturists'', Bill Joy was criticized for having technological tunnel vision on his prediction, by failing to consider social factors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.aaas.org/spp/rd/ch4.pdf |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20031231160458/http://www.aaas.org/spp/rd/ch4.pdf |dead-url=yes |archive-date=31 December 2003 |title=A Response to Bill Joy and the Doom-and-Gloom Technofuturists |date=13 April 2000 |accessdate=12 May 2011 |author="Brown, John Seely and Duguid, Paul" }}&lt;/ref&gt;  In [[Ray Kurzweil]]'s ''[[The Singularity Is Near]]'', he questioned the regulation of potentially dangerous technology, asking "Should we tell the millions of people afflicted with cancer and other devastating conditions that we are canceling the development of all bioengineered treatments because there is a risk that these same technologies may someday be used for malevolent purposes?".

{{Main article|Prey (novel)}}

''Prey'' is a 2002 novel by [[Michael Crichton]] which features an artificial swarm of nanorobots which develop intelligence and threaten their human inventors.  The novel generated concern within the nanotechnology community that the novel could negatively affect public perception of nanotechnology by creating fear of a similar scenario in real life.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Edwards |first=Steven A.  |title=The Nanotech Pioneers: Where Are They Taking Us?  |location=Weinheim |publisher=Wiley-VCH |year=2006 |pages=22–23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Drexler–Smalley debate===
[[File:Richard Smalley.jpg|thumb|Richard Smalley, a co-discoverer of the fullerenes, was involved in a public debate with Eric Drexler about the feasibility of [[molecular assembler]]s.]]
{{main article|Drexler–Smalley debate on molecular nanotechnology}}

Richard Smalley, best known for co-discovering the soccer ball-shaped “buckyball” molecule and a leading advocate of nanotechnology and its many applications, was an outspoken critic of the idea of [[molecular assembler]]s, as advocated by Eric Drexler.  In 2001 he introduced scientific objections to them&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| url=http://www.sciamdigital.com/index.cfm?fa=Products.ViewIssuePreview&amp;ARTICLEID_CHAR=F90C4210-C153-4B2F-83A1-28F2012B637|date=September 2001| journal=Scientific American| title=Of Chemistry, Love and Nanobots| first= Richard E.| last= Smalley |pmid=11524973| volume=285| issue=3| pages=76–7| doi=10.1038/scientificamerican0901-76| bibcode=2001SciAm.285c..76S}}&lt;/ref&gt; attacking the notion of universal assemblers in a 2001 ''[[Scientific American]]'' article, leading to a [[Counterargument|rebuttal]] later that year from Drexler and colleagues,&lt;ref name="smalleyresponse"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.imm.org/SciAmDebate2/smalley.php |title=Debate About Assemblers — Smalley Rebuttal |publisher=Institute for Molecular Manufacturing |year=2001 |accessdate=9 May 2010 |first1=K.

Storrs |last4=Hall |first5=Neil |last5=Jacobstein |first6=Tom |last6=McKendree |first7=Ralph |last7=Merkle |first8=Christine |last8=Peterson}}&lt;/ref&gt; and eventually to an exchange of [[open letter]]s in 2003.&lt;ref name="counterpoint"&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://pubs.acs.org/cen/coverstory/8148/8148counterpoint.html |title=Nanotechnology: Drexler and Smalley make the case for and against 'molecular assemblers' |journal=Chemical &amp; Engineering News |volume=81 |issue=48 |pages=37–42 |date=1 December 2003 |accessdate=9 May 2010 |doi=10.1021/cen-v081n036.p037}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Smalley criticized Drexler's work on nanotechnology as naive, arguing that chemistry is extremely complicated, reactions are hard to control, and that a universal assembler is science fiction.  Smalley believed that such assemblers were not physically possible and introduced scientific objections to them. His two principal technical objections, which he had termed the “fat fingers problem" and the "sticky fingers problem”, argued against the feasibility of molecular assemblers being able to precisely select and place individual atoms. He also believed that Drexler’s speculations about apocalyptic dangers of molecular assemblers threaten the public support for development of nanotechnology.

Smalley first argued that "fat fingers" made MNT impossible. He later argued that nanomachines would have to resemble chemical enzymes more than Drexler's assemblers and could only work in water. He believed these would exclude the possibility of "molecular assemblers" that worked by precision picking and placing of individual atoms.  Also, Smalley argued that nearly all of modern chemistry involves reactions that take place in a solvent (usually water), because the small molecules of a solvent contribute many things, such as lowering binding energies for transition states.  Since nearly all known chemistry requires a solvent, Smalley felt that Drexler's proposal to use a high vacuum environment was not feasible.

Smalley also believed that Drexler's speculations about apocalyptic dangers of self-replicating machines that have been equated with "molecular assemblers" would threaten the public support for development of nanotechnology. To address the debate between Drexler and Smalley regarding molecular assemblers ''[[Chemical &amp; Engineering News]]'' published a point-counterpoint consisting of an exchange of letters that addressed the issues.&lt;ref name="counterpoint"/&gt;

Drexler and coworkers responded to these two issues&lt;ref name="smalleyresponse"/&gt; in a 2001 publication.  Drexler and colleagues noted that Drexler never proposed universal assemblers able to make absolutely anything, but instead proposed more limited assemblers able to make a very wide variety of things. They challenged the relevance of Smalley's arguments to the more specific proposals advanced in ''Nanosystems''.  Drexler maintained that both were [[straw man]] arguments, and in the case of enzymes, Prof. Klibanov wrote in 1994, "...using an enzyme in organic solvents eliminates several obstacles..."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Phoenix|first=Chris|title=Of Chemistry, Nanobots, and Policy|url=http://crnano.org/Debate.htm|publisher=Center for Responsible Nanotechnology|accessdate=12 May 2011|date=December 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt; Drexler also addresses this in Nanosystems by showing mathematically that well designed catalysts can provide the effects of a solvent and can fundamentally be made even more efficient than a solvent/enzyme reaction could ever be.  Drexler had difficulty in getting Smalley to respond, but in December 2003, ''[[Chemical &amp; Engineering News]]'' carried a 4-part debate.&lt;ref name="counterpoint"/&gt;

[[Ray Kurzweil]] spends four pages in his book 'The Singularity Is Near' to showing that Richard Smalley's arguments are not valid, and disputing them point by point.  Kurzweil ends by stating that Drexler's visions are very practicable and even happening already.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Kurzweil|first=Ray|title=The Singularity Is Near|year=2005 |pages=193–196 |isbn=978-0-670-03384-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Royal Society report on the implications of nanotechnology===

{{further|Implications of nanotechnology#Studies on the implications of nanotechnology|l1=Studies on the implications of nanotechnology}}

The [[Royal Society]] and [[Royal Academy of Engineering]]'s 2004 report on the implications of nanoscience and nanotechnologies&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |publisher=Royal Society and Royal Academy of Engineering |title=Nanoscience and nanotechnologies: opportunities and uncertainties |date=July 2004 |url=http://www.nanotec.org.uk/finalReport.htm |accessdate=13 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; was inspired by [[Prince Charles]]' concerns about [[nanotechnology]], including [[molecular manufacturing]]. However, the report spent almost no time on molecular manufacturing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Royal Society in Denial|url=http://crnano.typepad.com/crnblog/2004/08/royal_society_i.html|publisher=Center for Responsible Nanotechnology|accessdate=13 May 2011|date=31 July 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In fact, the word "[[K. Eric Drexler|Drexler]]" appears only once in the body of the report (in passing), and "molecular manufacturing" or "[[molecular nanotechnology]]" not at all.  The report covers various risks of nanoscale technologies, such as nanoparticle toxicology.  It also provides a useful overview of several nanoscale fields. The report contains an annex (appendix) on [[grey goo]], which cites a weaker variation of [[Richard Smalley]]'s contested argument against molecular manufacturing. It concludes that there is no evidence that autonomous, self replicating nanomachines will be developed in the foreseeable future, and suggests that regulators should be more concerned with issues of nanoparticle toxicology.

== Initial commercial applications ==
{{further|List of nanotechnology applications}}

The early 2000s saw the beginnings of the use of nanotechnology in commercial products, although most applications are limited to the bulk use of passive [[nanomaterials]].  Examples include [[titanium dioxide]] and [[zinc oxide]] [[nanoparticle]]s in sunscreen, cosmetics and some food products; [[silver nanoparticles]] in food packaging, clothing, disinfectants and household appliances such as [[Silver Nano]]; [[carbon nanotube]]s for stain-resistant textiles; and cerium oxide as a fuel catalyst.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Nanotechnology Information Center: Properties, Applications, Research, and Safety Guidelines|url=http://www.americanelements.com/nanotech.htm|publisher=[[American Elements]]|accessdate=13 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;  As of March 10, 2011, the [[Project on Emerging Nanotechnologies]] estimated that over 1300 manufacturer-identified nanotech products are publicly available, with new ones hitting the market at a pace of 3–4 per week.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |year=2008 |url=http://www.nanotechproject.org/inventories/consumer/analysis_draft/ |publisher=The Project on Emerging Nanotechnologies |title=Analysis: This is the first publicly available on-line inventory of nanotechnology-based consumer products |accessdate=13 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[National Science Foundation]] funded researcher David Berube to study the field of nanotechnology. His findings are published in the monograph Nano-Hype: The Truth Behind the Nanotechnology Buzz.  This study concludes that much of what is sold as “nanotechnology” is in fact a recasting of straightforward materials science, which is leading to a “nanotech industry built solely on selling nanotubes, nanowires, and the like” which will “end up with a few suppliers selling low margin products in huge volumes." Further applications which require actual manipulation or arrangement of nanoscale components await further research. Though technologies branded with the term 'nano' are sometimes little related to and fall far short of the most ambitious and transformative technological goals of the sort in molecular manufacturing proposals, the term still connotes such ideas. According to Berube, there may be a danger that a "nano bubble" will form, or is forming already, from the use of the term by scientists and entrepreneurs to garner funding, regardless of interest in the transformative possibilities of more ambitious and far-sighted work.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Berube |first=David |title=Nano-Hype: The Truth Behind the Nanotechnology Buzz |location=Amherst, NY |publisher=Prometheus Books |year=2006 |url=http://www.prometheusbooks.com/index.php?main_page=product_info&amp;products_id=1822/ }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Integrated modification methodology''' ('''IMM''') is a procedure encompassing an open set of scientific techniques for morphologically analyzing the [[built environment]] in a multiscale manner and evaluating its performance in actual states or under specific design scenarios.

The methodology is structured around a nonlinear phasing process aiming for delivering a systemic understanding of any given urban settlement, formulating the modification set-ups for improving its performance, and examining the modification strategies to transform that system. The basic assumption in IMM is the recognition of the built environment as a [[Complex adaptive system|Complex Adaptive System]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Brownlee|first=J|date=2007|title=Complex Adaptive Systems|url=|journal=CIS Technical Report|volume=|pages=1–6|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

IMM has been developed by IMMdesignlab, a research lab based at [[Polytechnic University of Milan|Politecnico di Milano]] at the Department of Architecture, Built Environment and Construction Engineering (DABC).

==History==

IMM began in 2010 as an academic research at Politecnico di Milano. That research criticized the analytical approach frequently used to study and evaluate the built environment by most of the sustainable development methods. By Recognizing the built environment as a [[Complex Adaptive System]] (CAS), IMM is urged towards a holistic simulation rather than simplifying the complex mechanisms within the cities with [[reductionism]].

In 2013, Massimo Tadi established the ''IMMdesignlab'' at the Department of Architecture, Built Environment and Construction Engineering (DABC) of the Politecnico di Milano. The purpose of the mentioned laboratory is to develop IMM through research and education.

IN 2015, ''Integrated Modification Methodology for the Sustainable Built Environment'' has been approved as an academic course in the curriculum of the ''Architectural Engineering'', an International Master Program in Politecnico di Milano.

==Background==

At its theoretical background, Integrated Modification Methodology refers to the contemporary urban development as a highly paradoxical context arisen from the social and economic significance of the cities on the one hand and their arguably negative environmental impacts on the other. Asserting the inevitably of [[urbanization]], IMM declares that the only way to overcome that paradox for the cities is to develop in a profound integration with the [[ecology]]. According to IMM, the fundamental prerequisite of ecologically [[sustainable development]] is to have a comprehensive systemic understanding of the built environment.

IMM suggests that the advancement in construction techniques, building materials quality and transportation technologies alone have not solved the complex problems of the urban life simply because such improvements are not necessarily dealing with the systemic integration. The core argument of IMM is that the performance of the city is being chiefly driven by the complex relationships subsystems rather than the independent qualities of the urban elements. Thus, it aims at portraying the systemic structure of the built environment by introducing a logical framework for modeling the linkage between the city’s static and dynamic elements.

== Methodology ==

Integrated Modification Methodology is based on an iterative process involving the following four major phases:&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Tadi|first=Massimo|last2=Vahabzadeh Manesh|first2=S|date=2014|title=Transformation of an urban complex system into a more sustainable form via integrated modification methodology (I.M.M)|url=|journal=The International Journal of Sustainable Development and Planning|volume=9|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
# Investigation
# Formulation
# Modification
# Retrofitting and Optimization 
The first phase, Investigation, is a synthesis-based inquiry into the systemic structure of the urban form. It begins with ''Horizontal Investigation'' in which the area under study is being dismantled into its morphology-generator elements, namely Urban Built-ups, Urban Voids, Types of Uses, and Links. It follows with ''Vertical Investigation'' &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Vahabzadeh Manesh|first=S|last2=Tadi|first2=Massimo|date=2011|title=, Sustainable urban morphology emergence via Complex Adaptive System analysis|url=|journal=Procedia Engineering|volume=|pages=89–97|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; that is a study of integral relationships between the mentioned elements. The output of Vertical Investigation is a set of quantitative descriptions and qualitative illustrations of certain attributes named ''[[Key Categories]]''. In a nutshell they are types of [[emergence]] that show how elements come to self-organize or to synchronize their states into forming a new level of organization. Hence in IMM, Key Categories are the result of an emergence process of interaction between elementary parts (Urban Built-ups, Urban Voids, Types of Uses, and Links) to form a synergy able to add value to the combined organization. Key categories are the products of the synergy between elementary parts, a new organization that emerge not (simply as) an additive result of the proprieties of the elementary parts. 
IMM declares that the city’s functioning manner is chiefly driven from the Key Categories, hence, they have the most fundamental role in understanding the architecture of the city as a Complex Adaptive System. The Investigation phase concludes with the ''Evaluation'' step which is basically an examination of the system’s performance by referring to a list of verified indicators associated with ecological sustainability. The same indicators are later used in the CAS retrofitting process necessary for the final evaluation of the system performance, after the transformation design process occurred.

The Formulation phase is a technical assumption of the most critical Key Category and the urban element within the  area deduced from the Investigation phase. These critical attributes are being interpreted as the Catalysts of transformation and are to come to the designer’s use to set a contextual priority list of ''[[Design Ordering Principals]]''.

The third phase is the introduction of the modification/design scenarios to the project and advances with examining them by the exact procedure of the Investigation phase in a repetitive manner until the transformed context is predicted to be acceptable in arrangement and evaluation.

The fourth phase, Retrofitting and Optimization, is a testing process of the outcomes of the modification phase, then a local optimization by technical strategies (e.g. installing photovoltaic panels, designing green roofs, studying building orientations etc.) is initiated.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Tadi|first=Massimo|last2=Mohammad Zadeh|first2=Hadi|date=2014|others=Naraghi, Vahabzadeh Manesh|title=Environmental and energy performance optimization of a neighborhood in Tehran, via IMM methodology|url=|journal=International Journal of Engineering Science and Innovative Technology (IJESIT)|volume=|pages=409–428|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Istres-Le Tubé Air Base''' ({{lang-fr|Base Aérienne 125}} or '''BA&amp;nbsp;125''') is a large multi-role tasked [[French Air Force]] base located near [[Istres]], northwest of [[Marseille]], France. The airport facilities are also known as '''Istres - Le Tubé''' ([[ICAO airport code]]: LFMI).

==Operational units and uses==

===French Air Force===

The user of the base is the [[French Air Force]] with several operational units on the base, including:&lt;ref name="senat"&gt;{{cite web

* Tanker squadron 00.093 Bretagne equipped with [[KC-135 Stratotanker]].
* DAMS 11.004 (''Dépôt atelier de munitions spéciales'') or [[Special ammunition storage]], responsible for the hardened storage of the nuclear mid-range [[Air-Sol Moyenne Portée]] ASMP-A missiles to be used by fighter squadron 2/4 in its deterrent role.
* Air defence squadron 01.950 responsible for the base air defense.
* 25th air engineer regiment, a technical unit.
* Guard detachment ([[Fusiliers Commandos de l'Air]]) responsible for the base security and ground defences.

===Other uses===
The base also hosts a helicopter squadron and a large repair and training facility. In addition, it also includes [[EPNER]] (École du Personnel Navigant d’Essais et de Réception); test facilities for [[Délégation Générale pour l'Armement|DGA]] Essais en vol, [[Dassault Aviation]], [[SNECMA]], [[Thales Group|Thales]] and some aeronautical units of the [[French Navy]]. More than 5,000 personnel work on the base.

Secondary users occasionally include the [[United States Air Force]] (USAF), during Allied operations engaging United States and France. During [[Operation Allied Force]], USAF KC-135s and U-2s operated out of the base. Istres was the home of U-2 detachment OL-FR (Operating Location-FRance).&lt;ref&gt;http://www.encyclopedia.com/doc/1P2-769655.html, Washington Post, January 6, 1996&lt;/ref&gt; Istres was also designated by [[NASA]] as a contingency landing site for the [[Space Shuttle]] in the case of a [[Space Shuttle abort modes#Intact abort modes|Transoceanic Abort Landing]] (TAL).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.spaceref.com/news/viewpr.html?pid=17044|title=France to assist NASA with the future launches of the Space Shuttle|accessdate=2009-09-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; The base's runway is {{convert|3750|m|ft}} long and {{convert|60|m|ft}} wide. An additional overrun area {{convert|1200|m|ft}} long was built for Airbus Industries in 1992. It has the same characteristics as the runway, making it the longest runway in Western Europe and thus suited to Shuttle landings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ba125.air.defense.gouv.fr/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=164&amp;Itemid=211 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2012-02-18 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20120723222555/http://www.ba125.air.defense.gouv.fr/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=164&amp;Itemid=211 |archivedate=2012-07-23 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Incidents==

On 31 March 1992, a [[Boeing 707]] of [[Kabo Air]], a [[Nigeria]]n company, made an [[emergency landing]] at Istres after engines 3 and 4 had separated from the wing in [[turbulence]] at 35,000 feet. The aircraft performed a [[Flap (aeronautics)|flapless]], [[downwind]] landing with a touch-down speed of nearly 200 [[Knot (unit)|knots]] and the right wing on fire from the pouring fuel. The gear failed and the aircraft slid off the far end of the [[runway]], but the crew of five survived and the cargo was saved. The incident brought to light severe deficiencies in Kabo Air's operations — the aircraft had passed mandatory maintenance and was overloaded.

==World War II==
Built prior to [[World War II]], Istres Air Base was first used by the French Air Force during the early part of the war, and after the 1940 [[Battle of France]] and the June Armistice with Nazi Germany, became part of the limited ({{lang-fr|Armée de l'Air de Vichy}}) air force of the Vichy Government. It was attacked on several missions by Allied bombers based in [[England]] while under German control after November 1942. It was seized by Allied forces during [[Operation Dragoon]], the Invasion of Southern France in August 1944 and was repaired and placed into operational use by the [[United States Army Air Forces]] XII Engineer Command, being turned over to [[Twelfth Air Force]] on 27 August 1944.

The airfield was designated by the Americans as '''Istres/Le Tubé Airfield''' or '''[[Advanced Landing Ground]] Y-17'''. It was also given the AAF designation of '''USAAF Station 196'''. Twelfth Air Force initially assigned the [[324th Fighter Group]] to the airfield on 2 September, with [[Republic P-47 Thunderbolt]]s. However the 324th only remained a few days before moving forward to [[Ambérieu-en-Bugey Air Base|Amberieu]] on 6 September.

The main USAAF use of Istres was by the [[64th Troop Carrier Group]], which operated [[Douglas C-47 Skytrain]] transports from the airfield from September to November 1944. When the combat units moved north into eastern France, Istres was used by [[Air Transport Command (United States Air Force)|Air Transport Command]] as a transshipment point for supplies and Allied personnel, being administratively controlled by the 1411th Army Air Force Base Unit.

With the end of the war, the Americans used Istres as a staging point between Occupied Germany and [[Morocco]] for air transport of personnel back to the United States. It was returned to full French control in October 1945.&lt;ref&gt;{{Air Force Historical Research Agency}}

Sometime after World War II, until May 1958 Base Aérienne 125 was host to the [[Royal Air Force]] Liaison Party, that serviced transient British and Commonwealth military aircraft staging to and from the United Kingdom. In May 1958 the [[Royal Air Force]] Liaison Party, moved to Base Aérienne 115 Orange-Caritat where it continued into the early 1960s.

Card]], [[Thomas P. Moran]] and [[Allen Newell]] in 1980 in the ''[[Communications of the ACM]]'' and published in their book ''The Psychology of Human-Computer Interaction'' in 1983, which is considered as a classic in the HCI field.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Sauro|first1=Jeff|title=5 Classic Usability Books|url=http://www.measuringu.com/blog/usability-books.php|website=MeasuringU|accessdate=22 June 2015|ref=7}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Perlman|first1=Gary|title=Suggested Readings in Human-Computer Interaction (HCI), User Interface (UI) Development, &amp; Human Factors (HF)|url=http://hcibib.org/readings.html|website=HCI Bibliography : Human-Computer Interaction Resources|accessdate=22 June 2015|ref=8}}&lt;/ref&gt; The foundations were laid in 1974, when Card and Moran joined the [[PARC (company)|Palo Alto Research Center]] (PARC) and created a group named Applied Information-Processing Psychology Project (AIP) with Newell as a consultant aiming to create an applied psychology of human-computer interaction.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Card|first1=Stuart K|last2=Moran|first2=Thomas P|last3=Newell|first3=Allen|title=The Psychology of Human-Computer Interaction|date=1983|publisher=L. Erlbaum Associates Inc|location=Hillsdale|isbn=0898592437|pages=ix-x|ref=4}}&lt;/ref&gt; The keystroke-level model is still relevant today, which is shown by the recent research about mobile phones and touchscreens (see [[#Adaptions|Adaptions]]).

== Structure of the keystroke-level model ==
The keystroke-level model consists of six operators: the first four are physical motor operators followed by one mental operator and one system response operator:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Card|first1=Stuart K|last2=Moran|first2=Thomas P|last3=Newell|first3=Allen|title=The keystroke-level model for user performance time with interactive systems|journal=Communications of the ACM|date=1980|volume=23|issue=7|pages=398–400|doi=10.1145/358886.358895|ref=5}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''K''' (keystroke or button press): it is the most frequent operator and means keys and not characters (so e.g. pressing SHIFT is a separate K operation). The time for this operator depends on the motor skills of the user and is determined by one-minute typing tests, where the total test time is divided by the total number of non-error keystrokes.
* '''P''' (pointing to a target on a display with a mouse): this time differs depending on the distance to the target and the size of the target,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Fitts|first1=Paul M|title=The information capacity of the human motor system in controlling the amplitude of movement|journal=Journal of Experimental Psychology: General|date=1992|volume=47|issue=3|doi=10.1037/h0055392|ref=3|pmid=13174710|pages=381–91}}&lt;/ref&gt; but is held constant. A mouse click is not contained and counts as a separate K operation.
* '''H''' (homing the hand(s) on the keyboard or other device): This includes movement between any two devices as well as the fine positioning of the hand.
* '''D''' (drawing (manually) n&lt;sub&gt;D&lt;/sub&gt; straight-line segments with a total length of D(n&lt;sub&gt;D&lt;/sub&gt;, l&lt;sub&gt;D&lt;/sub&gt;) cm): where n&lt;sub&gt;D&lt;/sub&gt; is the number of the line segments drawn and l&lt;sub&gt;D&lt;/sub&gt; is the total length of the line segments. This operator is very specialized because it is restricted to the mouse and the drawing system has to constrain the cursor to a .56&amp;nbsp;cm grid.
* '''M''' (mentally preparing for executing physical actions): denotes the time a user needs for thinking or decision making. The number of Ms in a method depends on the knowledge and skill of the user. Heuristics are given to help decide where an M should be placed in a method. For example, when pointing with the mouse a button press is usually fully anticipated and no M is needed between both operators.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Card|first1=Stuart K|last2=Moran|first2=Thomas P|last3=Newell|first3=Allen|title=The keystroke-level model for user performance time with interactive systems|journal=Communications of the ACM|date=1980|volume=23|issue=7|pages=400–401|doi=10.1145/358886.358895|ref=5}}&lt;/ref&gt; The following table shows the heuristics for placing the M operator:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Card|first1=Stuart K|last2=Moran|first2=Thomas P|last3=Newell|first3=Allen|title=The keystroke-level model for user performance time with interactive systems|journal=Communications of the ACM|date=1980|volume=23|issue=7|pages=400|doi=10.1145/358886.358895|ref=5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{| class="wikitable collapsible" border="1"
|- 
| colspan="2" | Begin with a method encoding that includes all physical operators and response operations.&lt;br /&gt;
Use Rule 0 to place candidate Ms, and then cycle through Rules 1 to 4 for each M to see whether it should be deleted.
|-
| width="10%" align="center" | Rule 0 || Insert Ms in front of all Ks that are not part of argument strings proper (e.g., text strings or numbers).&lt;br /&gt;
Place Ms in front of all Ps that select commands (not arguments).
|-
| width="10%" align="center" | Rule 1 || If an operator following an M is fully anticipated in the operator just previous to M, then delete the M (e.g., PMK -&gt; PK). 
|-
| width="10%" align="center" | Rule 2 || If a string of MKs belong to a cognitive unit (e.g., the name of a command), then delete all Ms but the first.
|-
| width="10%" align="center" | Rule 3 || If a K is a redundant terminator (e.g., the terminator of a command immediately following the terminator of its argument), then delete the M in front of the K.
|-
| width="10%" align="center" | Rule 4 || If a K terminates a constant string (e.g., a command name), then delete the M in front of the K; but if the K terminates a variable string (e.g., an argument string) then keep the M. 
|}

* '''R''' (response time of the system): the response time depends on the system, the command and the context of the command. It only used when the user actually has to wait for the system. For instance, when the user mentally prepares (M) for executing his next physical action only the non-overlapping part of the response time is needed for R because the user uses the response time for the M operation (e.g. R of 2 seconds – M of 1.35 seconds = R of .65 seconds). To make things clearer, Kieras &lt;ref name=Kieras&gt;{{cite web|last1=Kieras|first1=David|title=Using the Keystroke-Level Model to Estimate Execution Times|url=http://www-personal.umich.edu/~itm/688/KierasKLMTutorial2001.pdf|accessdate=22 June 2015|ref=9|page=3}}&lt;/ref&gt; suggests the naming waiting time (W) instead of response time (R) to avoid confusion. Sauro suggests taking a sample of the system response time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Sauro|first1=Jeff|editor1-last=Jacko|editor1-first=Julie A|title=Estimating productivity: Composite operators for keystroke level modeling|journal=Human-Computer Interaction.

== Comparison with GOMS ==
The KLM is based on the keystroke level, which belongs to the family of [[GOMS]] models.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Card|first1=Stuart K|last2=Moran|first2=Thomas P|last3=Newell|first3=Allen|title=The Psychology of Human-Computer Interaction|date=1983|publisher=L. Erlbaum Associates Inc|location=Hillsdale|isbn=0898592437|pages=161–166|ref=15}}&lt;/ref&gt; The KLM and the GOMS models have in common that they only predict behaviour of experts without errors, but in contrast the KLM needs a specified method to predict the time because it does not predict the method like GOMS.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Card|first1=Stuart K|last2=Moran|first2=Thomas P|last3=Newell|first3=Allen|title=The Psychology of Human-Computer Interaction|date=1983|publisher=L. Erlbaum Associates Inc|location=Hillsdale|isbn=0898592437|pages=260|ref=16}}&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, the KLM has no goals and method selection rules, which in turn makes it easier to use.&lt;ref name="klm-book-goms"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Card|first1=Stuart K|last2=Moran|first2=Thomas P|last3=Newell|first3=Allen|title=The Psychology of Human-Computer Interaction|date=1983|publisher=L. Erlbaum Associates Inc|location=Hillsdale|isbn=0898592437|pages=269|ref=17}}&lt;/ref&gt; The KLM resembles the model K1 from the family of GOMS models the most because both are at the keystroke level and possess a generic M operator. The difference is that the M operator of the KLM is more aggregated and thus larger (1.35 seconds vs. 0.62 seconds), which makes its mental operator more similar to the CHOOSE operations of the model K2.&lt;ref name="klm-book-goms" /&gt; All in all, the KLM represents the practical use of the GOMS keystroke level.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Card|first1=Stuart K|last2=Moran|first2=Thomas P|last3=Newell|first3=Allen|title=The Psychology of Human-Computer Interaction|date=1983|publisher=L. Erlbaum Associates Inc|location=Hillsdale|isbn=0898592437|pages=264|ref=18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Advantages ==
The KLM was designed to be a quick and easy to use system design tool, which means that no deep knowledge about [[psychology]] is required for its usage.&lt;ref name="klm-paper-advantages"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Card|first1=Stuart K|last2=Moran|first2=Thomas P|last3=Newell|first3=Allen|title=The keystroke-level model for user performance time with interactive systems|journal=Communications of the ACM|date=1980|volume=23|issue=7|pages=409|doi=10.1145/358886.358895|ref=19}}&lt;/ref&gt; Also, task times can be predicted (given the [[#Limitations|limitations]]) without having to build a [[prototype]], recruit and test users, which saves time and money.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Sauro|first1=Jeff|editor1-last=Jacko|editor1-first=Julie A|title=Estimating productivity: Composite operators for keystroke level modeling|journal=Human-Computer Interaction. New Trends: Proceedings of the 13th International Conference (LNCS)|date=2009|volume=5610|pages=352–361|doi=10.1007/978-3-642-02574-7_40|ref=20|publisher=Springer-Verlag|location=Berlin Heidelberg}}&lt;/ref&gt; See the [[#Example|example]] for a practical use of the KLM as a system design tool.

== Limitations ==
The keystroke-level model has several restrictions:
* It measures only one aspect of performance: time,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Card|first1=Stuart K|last2=Moran|first2=Thomas P|last3=Newell|first3=Allen|title=The keystroke-level model for user performance time with interactive systems|journal=Communications of the ACM|date=1980|volume=23|issue=7|pages=400|doi=10.1145/358886.358895|ref=21}}&lt;/ref&gt; which means execution time and not the time to acquire or learn a task &lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Card|first1=Stuart K|last2=Moran|first2=Thomas P|last3=Newell|first3=Allen|title=The Psychology of Human-Computer Interaction|date=1983|publisher=L. Erlbaum Associates Inc|location=Hillsdale|isbn=0898592437|pages=260–261|ref=22}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* It considers only expert users. Generally, users differ regarding their knowledge and experience of different systems and tasks, motor skills and technical ability &lt;ref name="klm-paper-limitations-users"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Card|first1=Stuart K|last2=Moran|first2=Thomas P|last3=Newell|first3=Allen|title=The keystroke-level model for user performance time with interactive systems|journal=Communications of the ACM|date=1980|volume=23|issue=7|pages=397, 409|doi=10.1145/358886.358895}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* It considers only routine unit tasks &lt;ref name="klm-paper-limitations"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Card|first1=Stuart K|last2=Moran|first2=Thomas P|last3=Newell|first3=Allen|title=The keystroke-level model for user performance time with interactive systems|journal=Communications of the ACM|date=1980|volume=23|issue=7|pages=409|doi=10.1145/358886.358895|ref=24}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* The method has to be specified step by step&lt;ref name="klm-paper-limitations" /&gt;
* The execution of the method has to be error-free &lt;ref name="klm-paper-limitations" /&gt;
* The mental operator aggregates different mental operations and therefore cannot model a deeper representation of the user’s mental operations. If this is crucial, a GOMS model has to be used (e.g. model K2)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Card|first1=Stuart K|last2=Moran|first2=Thomas P|last3=Newell|first3=Allen|title=The Psychology of Human-Computer Interaction|date=1983|publisher=L. Erlbaum Associates Inc|location=Hillsdale|isbn=0898592437|pages=285–286|ref=25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Also, one should keep in mind when assessing a computer system that other aspects of performance (errors, learning, functionality, recall, concentration, fatigue, and acceptability),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Card|first1=Stuart K|last2=Moran|first2=Thomas P|last3=Newell|first3=Allen|title=The keystroke-level model for user performance time with interactive systems|journal=Communications of the ACM|date=1980|volume=23|issue=7|pages=396–397|doi=10.1145/358886.358895|ref=26}}&lt;/ref&gt; types of users (novice, casual)&lt;ref name="klm-paper-limitations-users" /&gt; and non-routine tasks have to be considered as well.&lt;ref name="klm-paper-limitations-users"/&gt;

Furthermore, tasks which take more than a few minutes take several hours to model and a source of errors is forgetting operations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Sauro|first1=Jeff|editor1-last=Jacko|editor1-first=Julie A|title=Estimating productivity: Composite operators for keystroke level modeling|journal=Human-Computer Interaction. New Trends: Proceedings of the 13th International Conference (LNCS)|date=2009|volume=5610|page=353|doi=10.1007/978-3-642-02574-7_40|ref=28|publisher=Springer-Verlag|location=Berlin Heidelberg}}&lt;/ref&gt; This implies that the KLM is best suited for short tasks with few operators.
In addition, the KLM can not make a perfect prediction and has a root-mean-square error of 21%.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Card|first1=Stuart K|last2=Moran|first2=Thomas P|last3=Newell|first3=Allen|title=The Psychology of Human-Computer Interaction|date=1983|publisher=L. Erlbaum Associates Inc|location=Hillsdale|isbn=0898592437|pages=275|ref=29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Example ==
The following example slightly modified to be more compact from Kieras shows the practical use of the KLM by comparing two different ways to delete a file for an average skilled typist. Note that M is 1.35 seconds as stated in the KLM&lt;ref name="klm-paper-operators-table" /&gt;&lt;ref name="klm-book-operators-table" /&gt; instead of 1.2 seconds used by Kieras. The difference between the two designs would remain the same either way for this example.

This shows that Design B is 1 second faster than Design A, although it contains more operations.

== Adaptions ==

The six operators of the KLM can be reduced, but this decreases the accuracy of the model. If this low of an accuracy makes sense (e.g. “back-of-the-envelope” calculations) such a simplification can be sufficient.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Card|first1=Stuart K|last2=Moran|first2=Thomas P|last3=Newell|first3=Allen|title=The Psychology of Human-Computer Interaction|date=1983|publisher=L. Erlbaum Associates Inc|location=Hillsdale|isbn=0898592437|pages=296|ref=34}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While the existing KLM applies to desktop applications, the model might not fulfill the range of mobile tasks,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Li|first1=Hui|last2=Liu|first2=Ying|last3=Liu|first3=Jun|last4=Wang|first4=Xia|last5=Li|first5=Yujiang|last6=Rau|first6=Pei-Luen Patrick|title=Extended KLM for mobile phone interaction: a user study result|journal=CHI EA '10 CHI '10 Extended Abstracts on Human Factors in Computing Systems|date=2010|publisher=ACM|location=New York|isbn=978-1-60558-930-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; or as Dunlop and Cross &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Dunlop|first1=M.|last2=Crossan|first2=A.|title=Predictive Text Entry Methods for Mobile Phones|journal=Personal Technologies|date=2000|pages=134–143}}&lt;/ref&gt; declaimed KLM is no longer precise for mobile devices. There are various efforts to extend the KLM regarding the use for mobile phones or touch devices. One of the significant contributions to this field is done by Holleis, who retained existing operators while revisiting the timing specifications. Furthermore, he introduced new operators: Distraction (X), Gesture (G), Initial Act (I). 
While Li and Holleis &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Holleis|first1=P.|last2=Otto|first2=F.|last3=Hussmann|first3=H.|last4=Schmidt|first4=A.|title=Keystroke-level model for advanced mobile phone interaction|journal=CHI ’07: Proceedings of the SIGCHI Conference on Human Factors in Computing Systems|date=2007|doi=10.1145/1240624.1240851}}&lt;/ref&gt; both agree that the KLM model can be applied to predict task times on mobile devices, Li suggests further modifications to the model, by introducing a new concept called operator blocks. These are defined as "the sequence of operators that can be used with high repeatability by analyst of the extended KLM.”.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Li|first1=Hui|last2=Liu|first2=Ying|last3=Liu|first3=Jun|last4=Wang|first4=Xia|last5=Li|first5=Yujiang|last6=Rau|first6=Pei-Luen Patrick|title=Extended KLM for mobile phone interaction: a user study result|journal=CHI EA '10 CHI '10 Extended Abstracts on Human Factors in Computing Systems|date=2010|publisher=ACM|location=New York|isbn=978-1-60558-930-5|page=3521}}&lt;/ref&gt;  He also discards old operators and defines 5 new mental operators and 9 new physical operators, while 4 of the physical operators focus on pen-based operations. 
Rice and Lartigue &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Rice|first1=A.D.|last2=Lartigue|first2=J. W.|title=Touch-Level Model ( TLM ): Evolving KLM-GOMS for Touchscreen and Mobile Devices Categories and Subject Descriptors|journal=ACM SE '14 Proceedings of the 2014 ACM Southeast Regional Conference Article No. 53|date=2014|doi=10.1145/2638404.2638532}}&lt;/ref&gt; suggest numerous operators for touch devices together with updating existing operators naming the model TLM (Touch Level Model).
They retain the operators Keystroke (K/B), Homing (H), Mental (M) and Response Time (R(t)) and suggest new touch specific operators partly based on Holleis’ suggested operators:

* Distraction. A multiplicative operator that adds time to other operators. 
* Pinch. A 2+ finger gesture commonly used to zoom out
* Zoom. A 2+ finger gesture commonly used to zoom in
* Initial Act. The action or actions necessary to prepare the system for use (e.g. unlocking device, tapping an icon, entering a password).
* Tap. Tapping some area of the screen to effect a change or initiate an action.
* Swipe. A 1+ finger gesture in which a finger or fingers are placed on the screen and subsequently moved in a single direction for a specified amount of time.
* Tilt. The tilting — or full rotation of — the entire device d degrees (or radians).
* Rotate. A 2+ finger gesture in which fingers are placed on the screen and then rotated d degrees (or radians) about a central axis.
* Drag. A 1+ finger gesture in which fingers are placed on the screen and then moved — usually in a straight line — to another location.

The '''light-harvesting complex''' (or '''antenna complex''') is an array of [[protein]] and [[chlorophyll]] molecules embedded in the [[thylakoid]] membrane of plants, which transfer light energy to one chlorophyll ''a'' molecule at the [[Photosynthetic reaction centre|reaction center]] of a [[photosystem]].

The [[photosynthetic pigment|antenna pigments]] are predominantly [[chlorophyll b|chlorophyll ''b'']], [[xanthophylls]], and [[carotene]]s. [[Chlorophyll a|Chlorophyll ''a'']] is known as the core pigment. Their absorption spectra are non-overlapping and broaden the range of light that can be absorbed in photosynthesis. The carotenoids have another role as an antioxidant to prevent photo-oxidative damage of chlorophyll molecules. Each antenna complex has between 250 and 400 pigment molecules and the energy they absorb is shuttled by [[resonance energy transfer]] to a specialized chlorophyll-protein complex known as the [[Photosynthetic reaction centre|reaction center]] of each [[photosystem]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Biochemistry 4th Ed.|last = Voet and Voet|first = Donald and Judith G.|publisher = Wiley|year = 2011|isbn = 978-0470-57095-1|location = USA|pages = 906}}&lt;/ref&gt; The reaction center initiates a complex series of chemical reactions that capture energy in the form of chemical bonds.

For photosystem II, when either of the two chlorophyll ''a'' molecules at the reaction center absorb energy, an electron is excited and transferred to an [[electron acceptor]] molecule, [[pheophytin]], leaving the chlorophyll ''a'' in an [[oxidation|oxidized]] state. The oxidised chlorophyll ''a'' replaces the electrons by [[photolysis]] that involves the oxidation of water molecules to [[oxygen]], [[proton]]s and [[electron]]s.

Under changing light conditions, the reversible phosphorylation of light harvesting chlorophyll a/b binding proteins (LHCII) represents a system for balancing the excitation energy between the two photosystems.&lt;ref name="PUB00015383"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Liu XD, Shen YG |title=NaCl-induced phosphorylation of light harvesting chlorophyll a/b proteins in thylakoid membranes from the halotolerant green alga, Dunaliella salina |journal=FEBS Lett. |volume=569 |issue=1–3 |pages=337–340 |year=2004 |pmid=15225658 |doi=10.1016/j.febslet.2004.05.065}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The N-terminus of the chlorophyll A-B binding protein extends into the stroma where it is involved with adhesion of granal membranes and photo-regulated by reversible phosphorylation of its threonine residues.&lt;ref name="PUB00015384"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Andersson B, Yang DH, Paulsen H |title=The N-terminal domain of the light-harvesting chlorophyll a/b-binding protein complex (LHCII) is essential for its acclimative proteolysis |journal=FEBS Lett. |volume=466 |issue=2–3 |pages=385–388 |year=2000 |pmid=10682866 |doi=10.1016/S0014-5793(00)01107-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; Both these processes are believed to mediate the distribution of excitation energy between photosystems I and II.

This family also includes the photosystem II protein PsbS, which plays a role in energy-dependent quenching that increases thermal dissipation of excess absorbed light energy in the photosystem.&lt;ref name="PUB00015385"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Kramer D, Bassi R, Li XP, Gilmore AM, Caffarri S, Golan T, Niyogi KK |title=Regulation of photosynthetic light harvesting involves intrathylakoid lumen pH sensing by the PsbS protein |journal=J.

'''Lithophytes''' are [[plants]] that grow in or on [[Rock (geology)|rocks]]. Those that grow on rocks are also known as '''epipetric''' or '''epilithic''' plants. Lithophytes that grow on land feed off nutrients from rain water and nearby decaying plants, including their own dead tissue. [[wikt:chasmophyte|Chasmophytes]] grow in fissures in rocks where soil or organic matter has accumulated.

Examples of lithophytes include several ''[[Paphiopedilum]]'' [[orchids]], [[fern]]s, many [[algae]] and [[liverwort]]s. Species that only grow on rock or gravel are [[obligate]] lithophytes. Species that grow on rocky substrate and elsewhere are [[facultative]] lithophytes.

As nutrients tend to be rarely available to lithophytes or chasmophytes, many species of [[carnivorous plants]] can be viewed as being [[Preadaptation|pre-adapted]] to life on rocks. By consuming prey, these plants can gather more nutrients than non-carnivorous lithophtytes.&lt;ref name=Habitat&gt;McPherson, S.R. (2010). ''Carnivorous Plants and their Habitats. Volume 1.'' Redfern Natural History Productions, Poole. pp.&amp;nbsp;176–180.&lt;/ref&gt; Examples include the [[pitcher plant]]s ''[[Nepenthes campanulata]]'' and ''[[Heliamphora exappendiculata]]'', many ''[[Pinguicula]]'' and several ''[[Utricularia]]'' species.

'''Multi-Channel DRAM''' or '''MCDRAM''' (pronounced ''em cee dee ram''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt;) is a [[Three-dimensional integrated circuit|3D-stacked]] [[Dynamic random-access memory|DRAM]] that is used in the [[Intel]] [[Xeon Phi]] processor codenamed [[Xeon_Phi#Knights_Landing|Knights Landing]].  It is a version of [[Hybrid Memory Cube]] developed in partnership with Micron, and a competitor to [[High Bandwidth Memory]].  

The many cores in the Xeon Phi processors, along with their associated vector processing units, enable them to consume many more gigabytes per second than traditional DRAM DIMMs can supply.  The "Multi-channel" part of the MCDRAM full name reflects the cores having many more channels available to access the MCDRAM than processors have to access their attached DIMMs.
&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt;
This high channel count leads to MCDRAM's high bandwidth, up to 400+ GB/s, although the latencies are similar to a DIMM access.

Its physical placement on the processor imposes some limits on capacity - up to 16&amp;nbsp;GB at launch, although speculated to go higher in the future.

==Programming==
The memory can be partitioned at boot time, with some used as cache for more distant DDR, and the remainder mapped into the physical address space.

The application can request pages of [[virtual memory]] to be assigned to either the distant DDR directly, to the portion of DDR that is cached by the MCDRAM, or to the portion of the MCDRAM that is not being used as cache.  One way to do this is via the&lt;code&gt;memkind&lt;/code&gt; API.

When used as cache, the latency of a miss accessing both the MCDRAM and DDR is slightly higher than going directly to DDR, and so applications may need to be tuned

to avoid excessive cache misses.

A '''material passport''' is a document consisting of all the materials that are included in a product or construction. It consist of a set of data describing defined characteristics of materials in products, which give them value for recovery, recycling and re-use.

The core idea behind the concept is that a material passport will contribute to a more "[[circular economy]]", in which materials are being recovered, recycled and/or re-used in an open traded material market. The concept of the 'material passport’ is currently being developed by multiple parties in mainly European countries. A possible second-hand material market or material-bank could become a reality in the future.

Similar concepts are being developed by several parties. Other names for the material passport are:
* Circularity passport &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Circularity Passports|url=http://www.epea.nl/circularity-passports/|website=www.epea.nl}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Cradle-to-cradle passport &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Cradle to cradle ship recycling|url=http://www.maersk.com/en/hardware/triple-e/the-hard-facts/cradle-to-cradle|website=www.maersk.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Product passport &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Product passport for eco-innovation|url=http://www.euractiv.com/section/sustainable-dev/news/eu-group-says-a-product-passport-would-open-doors-to-eco-innovation/|website=EurActiv.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==  Why is a material passport needed? ==
"According to United Nations estimates, construction accounts for some 50 percent of raw material consumption in Europe and 60 percent of waste" &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=EU research project "Buildings as material banks" gets under way: The Cradle to Cradle Material Passport becomes BIM-compatible - Drees &amp; Sommer|url=http://www.dreso.com/en/press/press-releases/detail/aktuell/eu-forschungsprojekt-buildings-as-material-banks-startet-der-cradle-to-cradle-materialpass-wi/|website=www.dreso.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Assuming that the earth is a closed system, this situation is objectively untenable. There is an urgent need to go about raw materials in a more intelligent way. A shift in the building sector would greatly benefit a situation towards needing less material, and using material more effectively, e.g. by ensuring a much longer and more useful life cycle.
Proponents of the material passport argue that it is a step towards this direction.

The material passport gives material an identity. By acknowledging that it exists, in a given form in a specific building, it ensures that material receives and keeps a value, e.g. through a possible re-use after the deconstruction of for example a building.

Like a personal passport, the material passport allows the material to ‘travel’, or identifies the most useful future destination after it has served in a building. This could be in another building or in another product altogether. 

By recognizing the individual materials in buildings, new ownership structures could be facilitated, that would enable more functions to be offered as a service. As we now can have lighting as a service, we could have other functions, such as "shelter from elements" as a service, instead of owning a roof.

In general, material passports create incentives for suppliers to produce and developers / managers / renovators to choose healthy, sustainable and circular materials/building products. They fit into a broader and growing movement that aims at developing circular building business models.

== Applicability ==
The material passport can be applied to every product or construction. There are different levels in which a product/construct can be discomposed:
* Product level
* Component level 
* Material level

For a building, a material passport could be a complete description of all products (staircase, window, furnace, …), components (iron beam, glass panel, …), and raw materials (wood, steel, …),that are present in the building. Ideally, this database is created during construction and subsequently continuously kept up to date. In case an existing building does not yet have a material passport, it can be created through various methods (e.g. plan analysis, digital 3D scanning).

A material passport allows the owner of a product/construct to know exactly what it is made of. This is of importance at the end of its useful life, to enable the most effective re-use of the materials. It allows the owner to view a product/construct as a depot, inventory of valuable materials.

Furthermore, the process of creating a material passport also shapes the design of the building. The easier the materials can be extracted and re-used, the better. This will lead to an increase of ‘recoverable’ or ‘reversible’ buildings, buildings that can be dis-assembled as easily as they were assembled.

Another possibility is that a material passport enables the owner to get a better overview of value of the product/construct. Besides the value of the location and of the space, it can now also improve the valuation of the materials used. A higher, or more accurate, valuation of product/construct can be made possible.

== Advantages and disadvantages ==
===Advantages===
* By having a material passport, one can anticipate on the deconstruction of the properties and ensure the highest possible usefulness of the materials used after having vacated premises. This is another way of being conscious about the footprint, and limiting our negative impact on the environment.
* A more granular understanding of the construction of a building, might enable novel forms of financing that will support suppliers to provide a service rather than sell a product.
* By reviewing how buildings are valued now, new financing products or financing policies (e.g. higher collateral value)can be developed that better reflect the (financial) value of buildings.
* The recovery of a collateral in case of default might improve through the sale of the parts instead of the building as a whole.

===Disadvantages===
* A passport needs to be kept up to date and maintained throughout a building's life. It is not known yet how work intensive this is, but for it to remain relevant, all changes to the building that happened after the passport was created, need to be logged. Potentially the value of this work will only be apparent at the end of the useful life of a building, which might be several decades away.
* The market for second hand materials is still in its infancy, and currently not able to support the optimal re-use of the materials in a building. Also, much more standardization, at least at the level of components, will be needed to increase the re-use the materials in a building.
* There is no standardization for material passports yet. Passports might therefore prove to have limited usefulness when ultimately needed, due to evolving requirements, or require additional investments during the life of the building to keep them up to market standard.
* Legislation needs to be put in place, to support more sustainable building, enable the development of services instead of ownership, … and support a broad deployment of material passports.
* The infrastructure, mainly IT, to support material passports still needs to be created.
The first scientific publication about a material passport (2012) was written by Maayke Damen and is called "[https://dspace.library.uu.nl/handle/1874/257741 A resources passport for a circular economy]".  It provides a comprehensive overview of the advantages and disadvantages of a material passport for every actor in the supply chain. It includes an outline for the content of a material passport.

'''Metascape''' is a free gene annotation and analysis resource that helps biologists make sense of one or multiple gene lists.  Metascape provides automated meta-analysis tools to understand either common or unique pathways and protein networks within a group of orthogonal target-discovery studies.

==History==
In the "OMICs" age, it is important to gain biological insights into a list of genes.  Although a number of bioinformatics sources exist for this purpose, such as [[DAVID]], they are not all free, easy to use, and well maintained.  To analyze multiple lists of genes originated from orthogonal but complementary "OMICs" studies, tools often require computational skills that are beyond the reach of many biologists.  A team of scientists self-organized to create and released Metascape on Oct 8, 2015.  Metascape has gone through multiple releases since then.  The latest release 3.0 supports key model organisms, pathway enrichment analysis, protein-protein interaction network and component analysis, automatic presentation of the results as publication-ready web report, Excel and PowerPoint presentations.  The first Metascape application was published on Dec 9, 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Tripathi S, et. al.|title=Meta- and orthogonal integration of influenza OMICs data defines a role for UBR4 in virus budding. |journal=Cell Host Nicrobe|volume=18 |issue=6 |pages=723–735 |year=2015 |pmid=26651948 |doi=10.1016/j.chom.2015.11.002|pmc=4829074}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Analysis workflow==
Metascape implements a CAME analysis workflow:
* Conversion: Convert gene identifiers from popular types (such as [[HUGO Gene Nomenclature Committee|Symbol]], [[RefSeq]], [[Ensembl]], [[UniProt]], [[UCSC Genome Browser|UCSC]]) into human [[Entrez]] gene IDs and vice versa.
* Annotation: Extract from dozens of function-relevant gene annotations, including protein families, transmembrane/secreted predictions, disease associations, compound associations, etc.
* Membership: Flag gene memberships based on a custom keyword search within selected ontologies, e.g., highlight known "invasion" genes.
* Enrichment: Identify enriched biological themes, particularly [[gene ontology|GO terms]], [[KEGG]], [[Reactome]], [[BioCarta]], as well as other pathways and data sets collected in [http://www.broadinstitute.org/gsea/msigdb MSigDB], etc.  In addition, enriched ontology terms are automatically clustered to reduce redundancy for easier interpretation.  Protein-protein interaction networks are constructed based on [[BioGRID]], OmniPath, InWeb_IM and dense components are identified and biologically interpreted. 

==Analysis report==
All analysis results are presented in a web report, which contains [[Microsoft Excel|Excel]] annotation and enrichment sheets, [[Microsoft PowerPoint|PowerPoint]] slides, and custom analysis files (e.g., .cys file by [[Cytoscape]], .svg by [http://circos.ca/ Circos]) for further offline analysis or processing.

'''Musica poetica''' was a term commonly applied to the art of composing music in sixteenth- and seventeenth-century German schools and universities. Its first known use was in the ''Rudimenta Musicae Planae'' (Wittenberg: 1533) of Nicolaus Listenius. Previously, music had been divided into [[musica theoretica]] and [[musica practica]], which were categorised with the [[quadrivium]] and [[trivium (education)|trivium]], respectively. Since music of the time primarily meant vocal music, it was natural for theorists to make analogies between the composition of music and the composition of [[Eloquence|oratory]] or poetry. Hence, the term ''musica poetica''.

Analogies between music and the rhetorical arts were made on several levels. [[Gallus Dressler]] (1563) suggested to liken the structure of a musical composition with that of a speech, as outlined in [[Classical antiquity|Classical]] sources, dividing it into such sections as [[exordium (rhetoric)|exordium]], [[medium (rhetoric)|medium]] and finis (literally, "beginning", "middle" and "end"). Another kind of analogy was to liken the rules or [[grammar]] of composition with those of speech, as illustrated by [[Joachim Burmeister]]'s use of ''tautoëpia'' to  label consecutive fifths and octaves (which were generally regarded as illegal except in special circumstances). 

Most significantly, though, special melodic, harmonic, or technical devices in music began to be associated with the figures of [[Classical antiquity|Classical]] oratory: for example, a rising or falling [[sequence]] in music was usually called climax in the literature of ''musica poetica''. However, it must be pointed out that such analogies were not always direct: terms used in ''musica poetica'' do not always correspond equivalently to their rhetorical counterparts (for example, in oratory, ''anaphora'' means a straightforward repetition of a word, but in music it can denote various kinds of repetitive device, such as the development of a subject through imitation ([[fugue]]); also, the presence of a rhetorical figure in the text being set to music did not imply an automatic application of that figure's musical equivalent (that is, it was never mandatory for composers to respond to such verbal ideas as "going up" with rising musical phrases (known as ''anabasis'' or ''ascensus'' in ''musica poetica''). 

A knowledge of both Classical rhetoric and ''musica poetica'' can greatly enhance the listener's understanding and appreciation of works composed in the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries, especially by such figures as [[Heinrich Schütz]] and [[Giacomo Carissimi]]. However, it is also important not to seek examples of musical figures on every page; while rhetoric and musical theory were strongly associated, the nature of this association was complex and variable.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="18082">The '''NPL Network''' or '''NPL Data Communications Network''' was a local area [[computer network]] operated by a team from the [[National Physical Laboratory (United Kingdom)|National Physical Laboratory]] in England that pioneered the concept of [[packet switching]]. Following a [[pilot experiment]]  during 1967, elements of the first version of the network, Mark I, became operational during 1969 then fully operational in 1970, and the Mark II version operated from 1973 until 1986. The NPL network, followed by the wide area [[ARPANET]] in the United States, were the first two computer networks that implemented packet switching, and were interconnected in the early 1970s. The NPL network was designed and directed by [[Donald Davies]].

==Origins==
In 1965, [[Donald Davies]], who was later was appointed to head of the NPL Division of Computer Science, proposed a national data network based on packet switching in ''Proposal for the Development of a National Communications Service for On-line Data Processing''. After the proposal was not taken up nationally, during 1966 he headed a team which produced a design for a local network to serve the needs of NPL and prove the feasibility of packet switching.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|last1=Pelkey|first1=James|title=Entrepreneurial Capitalism and Innovation:  A History of Computer Communications 1968-1988|url=http://www.historyofcomputercommunications.info/Book/4/4.11-NPLNetworkDonaldDavies66-71.html|accessdate=13 April 2016|chapter=NPL Network and Donald Davies 1966 - 1971|date=2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; The design was the first to describe the concept of an "Interface computer", today known as a [[Router (computing)|router]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Roberts|first1=Dr. Lawrence G.|title=The ARPANET &amp; Computer Networks|url=http://www.packet.cc/files/arpanet-computernet.html|accessdate=13 April 2016|date=May 1995|quote=Then in June 1966, Davies wrote a second internal paper, "Proposal for a Digital Communication Network" In which he coined the word packet,- a small sub part of the message the user wants to send, and also introduced the concept of an "Interface computer" to sit between the user equipment and the packet network.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The next year (1967) a written version of the proposal entitled ''NPL Data Network'' was presented by Roger Scantlebury at a conference at [[Gatlinburg]] of the proceedings of the [[Association for Computing Machinery]], which described how  equipment (''[[node (networking)|nodes]]'') used to transmit [[Signal (electrical engineering)|signals]] (''[[Network packet|packets]]'') would be connected by electrical links to re-transmit the signals between and to the nodes, and [[Interface (computing)|interface]] computers would be used to link node networks to so-called [[time-sharing]] computers and other [[User (computing)|users]].  The interface computers would transmit [[Multiplexing|multiplex]]  signals between networks, and nodes would [[switch]] transmissions while connected to electrical circuitry functioning at a rate of processing amounting to mega-bits.&lt;ref name="C.

==Packet switching==
The first theoretical foundation of [[packet switching]] was the work of [[Paul Baran]], in which data was transmitted in small chunks and routed independently by a method similar to [[store and forward|store-and-forward]] techniques between intermediate networking nodes. Davies independently arrived at the same model in 1965 and named it ''packet switching''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Scantlebury|first=Roger|title=''Internet pioneers airbrushed from history''|url=https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2013/jun/25/internet-pioneers-airbrushed-from-history|date=25 June 2013|publisher=The Guardian|accessdate=1 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=''Packets of data were the key...''|url=http://www.npl.co.uk/news/packets-of-data|publisher=NPL|accessdate=1 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; He chose the term "packet" after consulting
with an NPL linguist because it was capable of being translated into languages other than English without compromise.&lt;ref name=Harris&gt;{{Citation | last = Harris | first = Trevor | title = Who is the Father of the Internet?

'''Nanoelectromechanical systems''' ('''NEMS''') are a class of devices integrating electrical and mechanical functionality on the [[Nanoscopic scale|nanoscale]]. NEMS form the logical next miniaturization step from so-called [[microelectromechanical systems]], or MEMS devices. NEMS typically integrate transistor-like [[nanoelectronics]] with mechanical actuators, pumps, or motors, and may thereby form physical, biological, and [[chemical sensors]]. The name derives from typical device dimensions in the [[nanometer]] range, leading to low mass, high mechanical resonance frequencies, potentially large [[quantum mechanical]] effects such as [[Quantum harmonic oscillator|zero point motion]], and a high surface-to-volume ratio useful for surface-based sensing mechanisms.&lt;ref name = Ventra2004&gt;{{cite book |title=Introduction to Nanoscale Science and Technology (Nanostructure Science and Technology) |publisher=Springer |location=Berlin |date=2004|isbn=1-4020-7720-3 | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=mccEGiaPEJwC|author1 = Hughes, James E. Jr.|author2 = Ventra, Massimiliano Di |author3 = Evoy, Stephane |authorlink2 = Massimiliano Di Ventra}}&lt;/ref&gt; Uses include [[accelerometer]]s, or detectors of [[chemical substance]]s in the air.

==Overview==
As noted by [[Richard Feynman]] in his famous talk in 1959, "[[There's Plenty of Room at the Bottom]]," there are many potential applications of machines at smaller and smaller sizes; by building and controlling devices at smaller scales, all technology benefits.  Among the expected benefits include greater efficiencies and reduced size, decreased power consumption and lower costs of production in electromechanical systems.&lt;ref name = Ventra2004/&gt;

In 2000, the first [[very-large-scale integration]] (VLSI) NEMS device was demonstrated by researchers at IBM.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1016/S0924-4247(99)00254-X|title=VLSI-NEMS chip for parallel AFM data storage|date=2000|last1=Despont|first1=M|journal=Sensors and Actuators A: Physical|volume=80|issue=2|pages=100–107|last2=Brugger|first2=J.|last3=Drechsler|first3=U.|last4=Dürig|first4=U.|last5=Häberle|first5=W.|last6=Lutwyche|first6=M.|last7=Rothuizen|first7=H.|last8=Stutz|first8=R.|last9=Widmer|first9=R. }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Its premise was an array of AFM tips which can heat/sense a deformable substrate in order to function as a memory device.  Further devices have been described by Stefan de Haan.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=de Haan|first1=S.|journal=Nanotechnology Perceptions|volume=2|issue=3|date=2006|pages=267–275|issn=1660-6795|doi=10.4024/N14HA06.ntp.02.03|title=NEMS—emerging products and applications of nano-electromechanical systems}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2007, the International Technical Roadmap for Semiconductors (ITRS)&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.itrs.net/ ITRS Home] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151228041321/http://www.itrs.net/ |date=2015-12-28 }}. Itrs.net. Retrieved on 2012-11-24.&lt;/ref&gt; contains NEMS Memory as a new entry for the Emerging Research Devices section.

==Atomic force microscopy==
A key application of NEMS is [[atomic force microscopy|atomic force microscope]] tips.  The increased sensitivity achieved by NEMS leads to smaller and more efficient sensors to detect stresses, vibrations, forces at the atomic level, and chemical signals.&lt;ref name = Evoy2004&gt;{{cite book|author1=Massimiliano Ventra|author2=Stephane Evoy|author3=James R.

==Approaches to miniaturization==
Two complementary approaches to fabrication of NEMS can be found. The [[Top-down and bottom-up design|top-down]] approach uses the traditional microfabrication methods, i.e. [[Photolithography|optical]], [[electron beam lithography]] and thermal treatments, to manufacture devices. While being limited by the resolution of these methods, it allows a large degree of control over the resulting structures. In this manner devices such as [[Silicon nanowire | nanowires]], nanorods, and patterned nanostructures are fabricated from metallic thin films or etched [[semiconductor]] layers.

Bottom-up approaches, in contrast, use the chemical properties of single molecules to cause single-molecule components to self-organize or self-assemble into some useful conformation, or rely on positional assembly. These approaches utilize the concepts of molecular [[self-assembly]] and/or [[molecular recognition]]. This allows fabrication of much smaller structures, albeit often at the cost of limited control of the fabrication process.

A combination of these approaches may also be used, in which nanoscale molecules are integrated into a top-down framework. One such example is the carbon [[nanotube nanomotor]].{{citation needed|date=April 2016}}

==Materials==

=== Carbon allotropes===
Many of the commonly used materials for NEMS technology have been [[carbon]] based, specifically [[diamond]],&lt;ref name=diamondQ&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1038/ncomms4638|arxiv=1212.1347|title=Single-crystal diamond nanomechanical resonators with quality factors exceeding one million|journal=Nature Communications|volume=5|year=2014|last1=Tao|first1=Y.|last2=Boss|first2=J.

This is mainly because of the useful properties of carbon based materials which directly meet the needs of NEMS. The mechanical properties of carbon (such as large [[Young's modulus]]) are fundamental to the stability of NEMS while the metallic and [[semiconductor]] conductivities of carbon based materials allow them to function as [[transistor]]s.

Both graphene and diamond exhibit high Young's modulus, low density, low friction, exceedingly low mechanical dissipation,&lt;ref name=diamondQ /&gt; and large surface area.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1126/science.1136836|title=Electromechanical Resonators from Graphene Sheets|date=2007|last1=Bunch|first1=J.

Along with the mechanical benefits of carbon based materials, the electrical properties of carbon nanotubes and graphene allow it to be used in many electrical components of NEMS. Nanotransistors have been developed for both carbon nanotubes&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1038/29954|bibcode=1998Natur.393...49T|date=1998|last1=Dekker|first1=Cees|last2=Tans|first2=Sander J.|last3=Verschueren|first3=Alwin R. M.|journal=Nature|volume=393|issue=6680|pages=49–52|title=Room-temperature transistor based on a single carbon nanotube}}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as graphene.&lt;ref name = Westervelt2008&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1126/science.1156936|title=APPLIED PHYSICS: Graphene Nanoelectronics|date=2008|last1=Westervelt|first1=R. M.|journal=Science|volume=320|issue=5874|pages=324–325|pmid=18420920 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Transistor]]s are one of the basic building blocks for all electronic devices, so by effectively developing usable transistors, carbon nanotubes and graphene are both very crucial to NEMS.

==== Metallic carbon nanotubes ====
[[Image:Carbon nanotube bands.gif|thumb|Band structures computed using [[tight binding]] approximation for (6,0) CNT ([[zigzag]], metallic), (10,2) CNT (semiconducting) and (10,10) CNT (armchair, metallic).]]

[[Carbon nanotubes]] (CNTs) are allotropes of carbon with a cylindrical nanostructure. They can be considered a rolled up [[graphene]]. When rolled at specific and discrete ("[[chiral]]") angles, and the combination of the rolling angle and radius decides whether the nanotube has a bandgap (semiconducting) or no bandgap (metallic).
 
[[Metal]]lic carbon nanotubes have also been proposed for nanoelectronic [[interconnects]] since they can carry high current densities.&lt;ref name = Hermann2008/&gt;  This is a useful property as wires to transfer current are another basic building block of any electrical system. Carbon nanotubes have specifically found so much use in NEMS that methods have already been discovered to connect suspended carbon nanotubes to other nanostructures.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.micro.mavt.ethz.ch/publications/Bauerdick2006|doi=10.1116/1.2388965|title=Direct wiring of carbon nanotubes for integration in nanoelectromechanical systems|date=2006|last1=Bauerdick|first1=S.|last2=Linden|first2=A.|last3=Stampfer|first3=C.|last4=Helbling|first4=T.|last5=Hierold|first5=C.|journal=Journal of Vacuum Science and Technology B|volume=24|issue=6|page=3144|bibcode=2006JVSTB..24.3144B|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120323123849/http://www.micro.mavt.ethz.ch/publications/Bauerdick2006|archivedate=2012-03-23|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This allows carbon nanotubes to form complicated nanoelectric systems.  Because carbon based products can be properly controlled and act as interconnects as well as transistors, they serve as a fundamental material in the electrical components of NEMS.

====Difficulties====
Despite all of the useful properties of carbon nanotubes and graphene for NEMS technology, both of these products face several hindrances to their implementation.  One of the main problems is carbon’s response to real life environments.  Carbon nanotubes exhibit a large change in electronic properties when exposed to [[oxygen]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|pmid=10710305|date=2000|last1=Collins|first1=PG|last2=Bradley|first2=K|last3=Ishigami|first3=M|last4=Zettl|first4=A|title=Extreme oxygen sensitivity of electronic properties of carbon nanotubes|volume=287|issue=5459|pages=1801–4|journal=Science|bibcode = 2000Sci...287.1801C |doi = 10.1126/science.287.5459.1801 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Similarly, other changes to the electronic and mechanical attributes of carbon based materials must fully be explored before their implementation, especially because of their high surface area which can easily react with surrounding environments. Carbon nanotubes were also found to have varying conductivities, being either metallic or semiconducting depending on their [[Magnetic helicity|helicity]] when processed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1038/382054a0|bibcode=1996Natur.382...54E|title=Electrical conductivity of individual carbon nanotubes|date=1996|last1=Ebbesen|first1=T. W.|last2=Lezec|first2=H. J.|last3=Hiura|first3=H.|last4=Bennett|first4=J. W.|last5=Ghaemi|first5=H. F.|last6=Thio|first6=T.|journal=Nature|volume=382|issue=6586|pages=54–56}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Because of this, special treatment must be given to the nanotubes during processing to assure that all of the nanotubes have appropriate conductivities.  Graphene also has complicated electric conductivity properties compared to traditional semiconductors because it lacks an energy [[band gap]] and essentially changes all the rules for how electrons move through a graphene based device.&lt;ref name = Westervelt2008/&gt;  This means that traditional constructions of electronic devices will likely not work and completely new architectures must be designed for these new electronic devices.

===Biohybrid NEMS===
{{Main|Biological machine}}
The emerging field of bio-hybrid systems combines biological and synthetic structural elements for biomedical or robotic applications. The constituting elements of bio-nanoelectromechanical systems (BioNEMS) are of nanoscale size, for example DNA, proteins or nanostructured mechanical parts. Examples include the facile top-down nanostructuring of thiol-ene polymers to create cross-linked and mechanically robust nanostructures that are subsequently functionalized with proteins.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Shafagh|first=Reza|last2=Vastesson|first2=Alexander|last3=Guo|first3=Weijin|last4=van der Wijngaart|first4=Wouter|last5=Haraldsson|first5=Tommy|year=2018|title=E-Beam Nanostructuring and Direct Click Biofunctionalization of Thiol–Ene Resist|url=https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/acsnano.8b03709|journal=ACS Nano|language=en|doi=10.1021/acsnano.8b03709|}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Simulations==
Computer simulations have long been important counterparts to experimental studies of NEMS devices.  Through [[continuum mechanics]] and [[molecular dynamics]] (MD), important behaviors of NEMS devices can be predicted via computational modeling before engaging in experiments.&lt;ref name="DequesnesTangAluru"&gt;{{cite journal|title=Static and Dynamic Analysis of Carbon Nanotube-Based Switches|url=https://netfiles.uiuc.edu/aluru/www/Journals/JEMT04.pdf|doi=10.1115/1.1751180|date=2004|last1=Dequesnes|first1=Marc|last2=Tang|first2=Zhi|last3=Aluru|first3=N.

==Future==
Key hurdles currently preventing the commercial application of many NEMS devices include low-yields and high device quality variability.  Before NEMS devices can actually be implemented, reasonable integrations of carbon based products must be created.  A recent step in that direction has been demonstrated for diamond, achieving a processing level comparable to that of silicon.&lt;ref&gt;Y. Tao and C. L. Degen. "Facile Fabrication of Single-Crystal-Diamond
Nanostructures with Ultra High Aspect Ratio". Advanced Materials (2013)&lt;/ref&gt; The focus is currently shifting from experimental work towards practical applications and device structures that will implement and profit from such novel devices.&lt;ref name = Kis2008/&gt;   The next challenge to overcome involves understanding all of the properties of these carbon-based tools, and using the properties to make efficient and durable NEMS with low failure rates.&lt;ref name="LohWeiKeSullicanEspinosa"/&gt;

Carbon-based materials have served as prime materials for NEMS use, because of their exceptional mechanical and electrical properties.{{citation needed|date=April 2016}}

'''National Center for Theoretical Sciences''' (NCTS) in Taiwan was established on August 1, 1997 fully funded by the National Science Council (NSC), which is reorganized and became [[Ministry of Science and Technology (Taiwan)]] (MoST)&lt;ref&gt; https://www.most.gov.tw/en/public &lt;/ref&gt; on 2014. It is a national research center with the goal to contribute to the advancement of frontier research, and to promote interdisciplinary and international research cooperation in theoretical sciences.

NCTS was set up with a center in [[Theoretical Physics]] and one in [[Mathematics]]. For the first 18 years, NCTS was located on the campus of the [[National Tsing Hua University]], [[Hsinchu]]. Since 2015, [[NCTS Mathematics]]  has been relocated to the [[National Taiwan University]], [[Taipei]].  NCTS Physics and [[NCTS Mathematics]] operate mostly independently to serve their separate communities and cooperate on some of their national programs and strategies. [[Tung-Mow Yan]] was the founder director of NCTS. 

Previous directors of the Physics division were: Tung-Maw Yan, Ting-Kuo Lee, Darwin Chang, Tu-Nan Chang, Hsiang-Nan Li, Chung-Yu Mou, Ling-Fong Li and Xiao-Gang He. Current director is Chong-Sun Chu.

==Mission==

NCTS Physics aims to act as a national multidisciplinary facility and platform envision to contribute to the advancement of frontier research in physics.  Its academic programs and activities are operated with the goals: to act as an effective platform to stimulate and to enhance the interaction and collaboration among researchers; to empower talented students and postdoctoral researchers to make significant contributions in the frontier of research subjects; to serve as an efficacious channel to network the home researchers with other scholars and preeminent institutions abroad; and to explore new frontiers in physics research and innovation, and to enhance the extent and breadth of interdisciplinary researches as well as the collaboration with scientists in the experimental fields.

==Research==

Scientists at NCTS work on the following major research subjects and research topics:

'''High Energy Phenomenology, String and Gravity:''' [[dark matter]], [[dark energy]], nature of [[electroweak symmetry breaking]], [[neutrino]] physics, [[collider physics]], [[holographic]] and [[quantum informatic property of gravity]], [[scattering amplitudes]], [[inflationary cosmology]], quantum geometry and branes, exact results in QFT. 

'''Condensed Matter Physics:''' [[first principle calculations]] of new [[quantum materials]], [[topological materials]], [[spintronics]], [[strongly correlated system]], [[DMRG]] and [[tensor network]], [[emergent symmetry]], [[quantum transport]]. 

'''Atomic, Molecular and Optical Physics:''' many-body dynamics of [[ultracold atoms]], long-range effects, light-atom interaction and [[quantum control]], [[quantum steering]] and [[quantum information]]. 

'''Soft Matters, Bio-Physics and Complex Systems:''' complex and [[biological network]], [[complex dynamics]] and [[Chaos theory|chaos]], [[nonequilibrium statistical physics]] of driven/active soft matter, interplay of proliferation, utilization and feedback regulations in complex interacting system. 

== Programs ==

NCTS operates a number of academic programs in order to engage researchers in creative scientific activities. Interdisciplinary interactions are encouraged. Programs include the ''NCTS Topic Programs'' whose purpose is to encourage collaboration and to foster the generation of new ideas and initiatives for breakthrough; ''Rapid Response Workshop'' whose purpose is to respond actively and quickly to any sudden development of the field which has a significant potential of impact; ''NCTS Distinguished Lecturer'' whose objective is to bring distinguished scholars to NCTS to give a lecture or lecture series on a specific topic of research or a topic of general interest. In addition, we have an active visitor program with both international and domestic scientists.

NCTS scientists are also involved in advancing a number of ''Thematic Research'', ''Interdisciplinary Research and Experimental Collaboration Group'': these are focused research groups formed by a team of active home researchers with complementary expertise, with the primary goal of solving some of the outstanding problems of the subject, or to engage in rigorous interaction in order to foster collaboration across conventional boundaries and traditionally defined disciplines. These groups have been the breeding ground for a number of young brilliant PhD students and postdoctoral researchers who have gone on for a successful career in physics.

The survey has been conducted at 5-year intervals since 1977, most recently in 2007, though a 2010 mid-cycle data release occurred in December 2013. NRCS released initial results from the 1997 survey in late 1999. The 2010 report includes comparison of the data relative to 1982.

Summary pages exist for [[soil erosion]], land use status and trends, development of non-federal rural land, and rangeland.

A '''parody''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|p|ær|ə|d|i}}); also called a '''spoof''', '''send-up''', '''take-off''', '''lampoon''', '''play on (something)''', '''caricature''', or '''joke''' is a work created to imitate, make fun of, or comment on an [[original work]]—its subject, author, style, or some other target—by means of [[satire|satiric]] or [[irony|ironic]] [[imitation]]. As the literary theorist [[Linda Hutcheon]] puts it, "parody ... is imitation, not always at the expense of the parodied text." Another critic, Simon Dentith, defines parody as "any cultural practice which provides a relatively [[polemic]]al allusive imitation of another cultural production or practice."&lt;ref&gt;Dentith (2000) p.9&lt;/ref&gt;
Parody may be found in art or culture, including [[literature]], [[parody music|music]] (although "parody" in music has an earlier, somewhat different meaning than for other art forms), [[animation]], [[Video game|gaming]], and [[film]].

The writer and critic [[John Gross]] observes in his ''Oxford Book of Parodies'', that parody seems to flourish on territory somewhere between [[pastiche]] ("a composition in another artist's manner, without satirical intent") and [[burlesque]] (which "fools around with the material of high literature and adapts it to low ends").&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=J.M.W. Thompson  |title=Close to the Bone |publisher=Standpoint magazine |date= May 2010 |url=http://standpointmag.co.uk/books-may-10-close-to-the-bone-oxford-book-of-parodies-john-gross}}&lt;/ref&gt; Meanwhile, the ''[[Encyclopédie]]'' of [[Denis Diderot]] distinguishes between the parody and the burlesque, "A good parody is a fine amusement, capable of amusing and instructing the most sensible and polished minds; the burlesque is a miserable buffoonery which can only please the populace."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://hdl.handle.net/2027/spo.did2222.0000.811|title=Parody|website=Hdl.handle.net|accessdate=3 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Historically, when a formula grows tired, as in the case of the moralistic melodramas in the 1910s, it retains value only as a parody, as demonstrated by the [[Buster Keaton]] shorts that mocked that genre.&lt;ref name="Balducci2011p231"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=pSa-fqnL7iIC&amp;pg=PA231|title=The Funny Parts: A History of Film Comedy Routines and Gags|first=Anthony|last=Balducci|date=28 November 2011|publisher=McFarland|accessdate=3 October 2018|via=Google Books}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Origins==
According to [[Aristotle]] (''[[Poetics (Aristotle)|Poetics]]'', ii. 5), [[Hegemon of Thasos]] was the inventor of a kind of parody; by slightly altering the wording in well-known poems he transformed the sublime into the ridiculous. In ancient [[Greek literature]], a ''parodia'' was a narrative poem imitating the style and prosody of [[Epic poetry|epic]]s "but treating light, satirical or [[mock-heroic]] subjects."&lt;ref&gt;(Denith, 10)&lt;/ref&gt; Indeed, the components of the Greek word are παρά ''para'' "beside, counter, against" and ᾠδή ''oide'' "song." Thus, the original Greek word παρῳδία ''parodia'' has sometimes been taken to mean "counter-song", an imitation that is set against the original. The ''Oxford English Dictionary'', for example, defines parody as imitation "turned as to produce a ridiculous effect."&lt;ref&gt;Quoted in Hutcheon, 32.&lt;/ref&gt; Because ''par-'' also has the non-antagonistic meaning of ''beside'', "there is nothing in ''parodia'' to necessitate the inclusion of a concept of ridicule."&lt;ref&gt;(Hutcheon, 32)&lt;/ref&gt; [[Old Comedy]] contained parody, even the gods could be made fun of. ''[[The Frogs]]'' portrays the hero-turned-god [[Heracles]] as a glutton and the God of Drama [[Dionysus]] as cowardly and unintelligent. The traditional trip to the Underworld story is parodied as Dionysus dresses as Heracles to go to the Underworld, in an attempt to bring back a Poet to save Athens.

In the 2nd century AD, [[Lucian of Samosata]], a Greek-language writer in [[Syria]], created a parody of travel/geography texts like [[Indica (Ctesias)|Indica]] and [[The Odyssey]]. He described the authors of such accounts as liars who had never traveled, nor talked to any credible person who had. In his ironically named book [[True History]] Lucian delivers a story which exaggerates the hyperbole and improbable claims of those stories. Sometimes described as the first [[Science Fiction]], along the lines of [[The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy]], the [[Character (arts)|characters]] travel to the moon, engage in interplanetary war with the help of aliens they meet there, and then return to the earth to experience civilization inside a 200 mile long creature generally interpreted as being a whale. This is a parody of [[Ctesias]]' claims that India has a one-legged race of humans with a single foot so huge it can be used as an umbrella, [[Homer]]'s stories of one-eyed giants, and so on.

[[Ancient Rome|Roman]] writers explained parody as an imitation of one poet by another for humorous effect.{{Citation needed|date=August 2011}} In [[France|French]] [[Neoclassical literature]], ''parody'' was also a type of poem where one work imitates the style of another to produce a humorous effect. The [[Ancient Greece|Ancient Greeks]] created [[satyr]] [[Play (theatre)|play]]s which parodied [[tragic play]]s, often with performers dressed like satyrs.

==Music==
{{Main|Parody music}}
In [[classical music]], as a technical term, ''parody'' refers to a reworking of one kind of composition into another (for example, a [[motet]] into a keyboard work as [[Girolamo Cavazzoni]], [[Antonio de Cabezón]], and [[Alonso Mudarra]] all did to [[Josquin des Prez]] [[motet]]s).&lt;ref name=g1&gt;Tilmouth, Michael and Richard Sherr. [http://www.oxfordmusiconline.com/subscriber/article/grove/music/20937 "Parody (i)"]'  Grove Music Online, Oxford Music Online, accessed 19 February 2012 {{subscription}}&lt;/ref&gt; More commonly, a [[parody mass]] (''missa parodia'') or an [[oratorio]] used extensive quotation from other vocal works such as motets or [[cantata]]s; [[Tomás Luis de Victoria|Victoria]], [[Giovanni Pierluigi da Palestrina|Palestrina]], [[Orlande de Lassus|Lassus]], and other composers of the 16th century used this technique. The term is also sometimes applied to procedures common in the [[Baroque music|Baroque period]], such as when [[Johann Sebastian Bach|Bach]] reworks music from [[Bach cantata|cantata]]s in his ''[[Christmas Oratorio]]''.

The musicological definition of the term ''parody'' has now generally been supplanted by a more general meaning of the word. In its more contemporary usage, [[parody music|musical parody]] usually has humorous, even satirical intent, in which familiar musical ideas or lyrics are lifted into a different, often incongruous, context.&lt;ref name=g2&gt;Burkholder, J. Peter. [http://www.oxfordmusiconline.com/subscriber/article/grove/music/52918pg8  "Borrowing"], Grove Music Online, Oxford Music Online, accessed 19 February. 2012 {{subscription}}&lt;/ref&gt; Musical parodies may imitate or refer to the peculiar style of a composer or artist, or even a general style of music. For example, ''The Ritz Roll and Rock'', a song and dance number performed by [[Fred Astaire]] in the movie ''[[Silk Stockings]]'', parodies the [[Rock and Roll]] genre. Conversely, while the best-known work of [[Weird Al Yankovic]] is based on particular popular songs, it also often utilises wildly incongruous elements of [[popular culture|pop culture]] for comedic effect.

==English term==
[[File:Jan Brueghel the Younger, Satire on Tulip Mania, c. 1640.jpg|thumb|''{{Interlanguage link multi|Allegory of the Tulip omania|de|3=Allegorie der Tulipomanie}}'', persiflage on the [[tulip mania]], by [[Jan Brueghel the Younger]] (1640s]]

The first usage of the word ''parody'' in English cited in the ''[[Oxford English Dictionary]]'' is in [[Ben Jonson]], in ''Every Man in His Humour'' in 1598: "A Parodie, a parodie! to make it absurder than it was." The next citation comes from [[John Dryden]] in 1693, who also appended an explanation, suggesting that the word was in common use, meaning to make fun of or re-create what you are doing.

==Modernist and post-modernist parody==
In the 20th century, parody has been heightened as the central and most representative artistic device, the catalysing agent of artistic creation and innovation.&lt;ref name="Sheinberg 2000p141"&gt;Sheinberg (2000) pp.141, 150&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Stavans1997p37"&gt;Stavans (1997) [https://books.google.com/books?id=Ro6a1EyaS2AC&amp;pg=PA37 p.37]&lt;/ref&gt; This most prominently happened in the second half of the century with [[postmodernism]], but earlier [[modernism]] and [[Russian formalism]] had anticipated this perspective.&lt;ref name="Sheinberg 2000p141"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Bradbury, Malcolm [https://books.google.com/books?id=hUtOMoCNHyIC ''No, not Bloomsbury''] p.53, quoting [[Boris Eikhenbaum]]: {{quotation|Nearly all periods of artistic innovation have had a strong parodic impulse, advancing generic change. As the Russian formalist Boris Eichenbaum once put it: "In the evolution of each genre, there are times when its use for entirely serious or elevated objectives degenerates and produces a comic or parodic form....And thus is produced the regeneration of the genre: it finds new possibilities and new forms."}}&lt;/ref&gt; For the Russian formalists, parody was a way of liberation from the background text that enables to produce new and autonomous artistic forms.&lt;ref name="Hutcheon85p28"&gt;Hutcheon (1985) pp.28, 35&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Boris Eikhenbaum]] ''Theory of the "Formal Method"'' (1925) and ''O. Henry and the Theory of the Short Story'' (1925)&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Jorge Luis Borges]]'s (1939) short story "[[Pierre Menard, Author of the Quixote]]", is often regarded as predicting postmodernism and conceiving the ideal of the ultimate parody.&lt;ref name="Stavans1997p31"&gt;Stavans (1997) [https://books.google.com/books?id=Ro6a1EyaS2AC&amp;pg=PA31 p.31]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Elizabeth Bellalouna, Michael L. LaBlanc, Ira Mark Milne (2000) [https://books.google.com/books?id=CecJAQAAMAAJ ''Literature of Developing Nations for Students: L-Z''] p.50&lt;/ref&gt; In the broader sense of Greek ''parodia'', parody can occur when whole elements of one work are lifted out of their context and reused, not necessarily to be ridiculed.&lt;ref name="Elices2004p90"&gt;Elices (2004) p.90 quotation: {{quotation|From these words, it can be inferred that Genette's conceptualisation does not diverge from Hutcheon's, in the sense that he does not mention the component of ridicule that is suggested by the prefix ''paros''. Genette alludes to the re-interpretative capacity of parodists in order to confer an artistic autonomy to their works.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Traditional definitions of parody usually only discuss parody in the stricter sense of something intended to ridicule the text it parodies. There is also a broader, extended sense of parody that may not include ridicule, and may be based on many other uses and intentions.&lt;ref name="Elices2004p90"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Hutcheon85p50"&gt;Hutcheon (1985) p.50&lt;/ref&gt; The broader sense of parody, parody done with intent other than ridicule, has become prevalent in the modern parody of the 20th century.&lt;ref name="Hutcheon85p50"/&gt; In the extended sense, the modern parody does not target the parodied text, but instead uses it as a weapon to target something else.&lt;ref name="Hutcheon85p52"&gt;Hutcheon (1985) p.52&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Yunck 1963&lt;/ref&gt; The reason for the prevalence of the extended, recontextualizing type of parody in the 20th century is that artists have sought to connect with the past while registering differences brought by [[modernity]].&lt;ref&gt;Hutcheon (1985)&lt;/ref&gt;{{Page needed|date=January 2012}} Major modernist examples of this recontextualizing parody include [[James Joyce]]'s ''[[Ulysses (novel)|Ulysses]]'', which incorporates elements of [[Homer]]'s ''[[Odyssey]]'' in a 20th-century Irish context, and [[T. S. Eliot]]'s ''[[The Waste Land]]'',&lt;ref name="Hutcheon85p52"/&gt; which incorporates and recontextualizes elements of a vast range of prior texts, including [[Dante]]'s ''[[Divine Comedy|The Inferno]]''.{{Citation needed|date=January 2012}} The work of [[Andy Warhol]] is another prominent example of the modern "recontextualizing" parody.&lt;ref name="Hutcheon85p52"/&gt; According to French literary theorist [[Gérard Genette]], the most rigorous and elegant form of parody is also the most economical, that is a ''minimal parody'', the one that literally reprises a known text and gives it a new meaning.&lt;ref&gt;[[Gérard Genette]] (1982) [https://books.google.com/books?id=KbYzNp94C9oC&amp;pg=PA16 ''Palimpsests: literature in the second degree''] p.16&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Sangsue2006p72"&gt;Sangsue (2006) [https://books.google.com/books?id=Z5MWFcIEE7EC&amp;pg=PA72 p.72] quotation: {{quotation|Genette individua la forma "piú rigorosa" di parodia nella "parodia minimale", consistente nella ripresa letterale di un testo conosciuto e nella sua applicazione a un nuovo contesto, come nella citazione deviata dal suo senso}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Blank parody, in which an artist takes the skeletal form of an art work and places it in a new context without ridiculing it, is common.{{Citation needed|date=January 2012}} [[Pastiche]] is a closely related [[genre]], and parody can also occur when characters or settings belonging to one work are used in a humorous or ironic way in another, such as the transformation of minor characters [[Rosencrantz and Guildenstern]] from [[Shakespeare]]'s drama [[Hamlet]] into the principal characters in a comedic perspective on the same events in the play (and film) ''[[Rosencrantz and Guildenstern Are Dead]]''.{{Citation needed|date=January 2012}} Similarly, [[Mishu Hilmy]]'s ''Trapped in the Netflix'' uses parody to [[Deconstruction|deconstruct]] contemporary [[Netflix]] shows like [[Mad Men]] providing commentary through popular characters. Don Draper [[mansplaining]] about mansplaining, [[Luke Danes]] monologizing about a lack of independence while embracing [[codependency]].&lt;ref name="pink"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Willett|first1=Bec|title=Trapped in the Netflix at iO|url=http://perform.ink/review-trapped-netflix-io/|accessdate=23 March 2018|publisher=''[[Performink]]''|date=17 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In [[Flann O'Brien]]'s novel ''[[At Swim-Two-Birds]]'', for example, mad [[King Sweeney]], [[Fionn mac Cumhaill|Finn MacCool]], a [[pookah]], and an assortment of [[cowboy]]s all assemble in an inn in [[Dublin]]: the mixture of mythic characters, characters from [[genre]] fiction, and a quotidian setting combine for a humor that is not directed at any of the characters or their authors. This combination of established and identifiable characters in a new setting is not the same as the [[post-modernist]] trope of using historical characters in fiction out of context to provide a metaphoric element.{{Citation needed|date=January 2012}}

==Reputation==
Sometimes the reputation of a parody outlasts the reputation of what is being parodied. For example, ''[[Don Quixote]]'', which mocks the traditional [[knight errant]] tales, is much better known than the novel that inspired it, ''[[Amadis de Gaula]]'' (although Amadis is mentioned in the book). Another case is the [[novel]] ''[[Shamela]]''  by [[Henry Fielding]] (1742), which was a parody of the gloomy [[epistolary novel]] ''[[Pamela (novel)|Pamela, or Virtue Rewarded]]'' (1740) by [[Samuel Richardson]]. Many of [[Lewis Carroll]]'s parodies of Victorian didactic verse for children, such as "[[You Are Old, Father William]]", are much better known than the (largely forgotten) originals. [[Stella Gibbons]]'s comic novel ''[[Cold Comfort Farm]]'' has eclipsed the pastoral novels of [[Mary Webb]] which largely inspired it.

In more recent times, the television sitcom ''[['Allo 'Allo!]]'' is perhaps better known than the drama ''[[Secret Army (TV series)|Secret Army]]'' which it parodies.

Some artists carve out careers by making parodies. One of the best-known examples is that of [["Weird Al" Yankovic]]. His career of parodying other musical acts and their songs has outlasted many of the artists or bands he has parodied.  Yankovic is not required under law to get permission to parody; as a personal rule, however, he does seek permission to parody a person's song before recording it. Several artists, such as rapper [[Chamillionaire]] and Seattle-based [[grunge]] band [[Nirvana (band)|Nirvana]] stated that Yankovic's parodies of their respective songs were excellent, and many artists have considered being parodied by him to be a badge of honor.&lt;ref name="Ayers"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://blogs.wsj.com/speakeasy/2014/07/24/weird-al-interview-mandatory-fun/|title=‘Weird Al’ Yankovic Explains His Secret Formula for Going Viral and Hitting No. 1|last=Ayers|first=Mike|date=24 July 2014|work=[[The Wall Street Journal]]|accessdate=12 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Hamersly"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.miami.com/quotweird-alquot-yankovic-brings-his-masterful-musical-parody-south-florida-article|title="Weird Al" Yankovic brings his masterful musical parody to South Florida|last=Hamersly|first=Michael|work=[[Miami Herald]]|accessdate=12 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the US legal system the point that in most cases a parody of a work constitutes fair use was upheld in the case of [[Rick Dees]], who decided to use 29 seconds of the music from the song ''When Sonny Gets Blue'' to parody [[Johnny Mathis]]' singing style even after being refused permission. An appeals court upheld the trial court's decision that this type of parody represents fair use. ''[[Fisher v. Dees]]'' [[Court citation|794 F.2d 432]] (9th Cir. 1986)

==Film parodies==
{{Main article|Parody film}}
{{Original research|section|date=May 2009}}
Some [[Genre|genre theorists]], following [[Bakhtin]], see parody as a natural development in the life cycle of any [[genre]]; this idea has proven especially fruitful for genre film theorists. Such theorists note that [[Western movie]]s, for example, after the classic stage defined the conventions of the genre, underwent a parody stage, in which those same conventions were ridiculed and critiqued. Because audiences had seen these classic Westerns, they had expectations for any new Westerns, and when these expectations were inverted, the audience laughed.

Perhaps the earliest parody film was the 1922 ''[[Mud and Sand]]'', a [[Stan Laurel]] film that made fun of [[Rudolph Valentino]]'s film ''[[Blood and Sand (1922 film)|Blood and Sand]]''. Laurel specialized in parodies in the mid-1920s, writing and acting in a number of them. Some were send-ups of popular films, such as ''[[Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde (disambiguation)|Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde]]''&lt;!-- there are several such films so don't disambiguate this link --&gt;—parodied in the comic ''[[Dr. Pyckle and Mr. Pryde]]'' (1926). Others were spoofs of Broadway plays, such as ''[[No, No, Nanette]]'' (1925), parodied as ''[[Yes, Yes, Nanette]]'' (1925). In 1940 [[Charlie Chaplin]] created a satirical comedy about [[Adolf Hitler]] with the film ''[[The Great Dictator]]'', following the first-ever Hollywood parody of the Nazis, the [[Three Stooges]]' short subject ''[[You Nazty Spy!]]''.

About 20 years later [[Mel Brooks]] started his career with a Hitler parody as well. After ''[[The Producers (1968 film)|The Producers]]'' (1968), Brooks became one of the most famous film parodists and did spoofs on any kind of film genre. ''[[Blazing Saddles]]'' (1974) is a parody of western films, ''[[Young Frankenstein]]'' (1974) is a [[Frankenstein]] spoof, ''[[Spaceballs]]'' (1987) is a ''[[Star Wars]]'' spoof, and ''[[Robin Hood Men in Tights]]'' (1993) is Brooks' take on the classic Robin Hood tale.

The British comedy group [[Monty Python]] is also famous for its parodies, for example, the [[King Arthur]] spoof ''[[Monty Python and the Holy Grail]]'' (1974), and the [[Jesus]] satire ''[[Life of Brian]]'' (1979). In the 1980s the team of [[David Zucker (filmmaker)|David Zucker]], [[Jim Abrahams]] and [[Jerry Zucker (film director)|Jerry Zucker]] parodied well-established genres such as disaster, war and crime movies with the ''[[Airplane!]]'', ''[[Hot Shots!]]'' and ''[[The Naked Gun|Naked Gun]]'' series respectively. There is a 1989 film parody from Spain of the TV series ''[[The A-Team]]'' called ''El equipo Aahhgg'' directed by José Truchado.

More recently, parodies have taken on whole film genres at once. One of the first was ''[[Don't Be a Menace to South Central While Drinking Your Juice in the Hood]]'' and the ''[[Scary Movie (series)|Scary Movie]]'' franchise. Other recent genre parodies include. ''[[Shriek If You Know What I Did Last Friday The 13th]]'', ''[[Not Another Teen Movie]]'', ''[[Date Movie]]'', ''[[Epic Movie]]'', ''[[Meet the Spartans]]'', ''[[Superhero Movie]]'', ''[[Disaster Movie]]'', ''[[Vampires Suck]]'', and ''[[The 41-Year-Old Virgin Who Knocked Up Sarah Marshall and Felt Superbad About It]]'', all of which have been critically panned.{{citation needed|date=November 2016}}

===Copyright===
Many parody films have as their target out-of-copyright or non-copyrighted subjects (such as ''Frankenstein'' or Robin Hood) whilst others settle for imitation which does not infringe copyright, but is clearly aimed at a popular (and usually lucrative) subject. The spy film craze of the 1960s, fuelled by the popularity of [[James Bond]] is such an example. In this genre a rare, and possibly unique, example of a parody film taking aim at a non-comedic subject over which it actually holds copyright is the 1967 James Bond spoof ''[[Casino Royale (1967)|Casino Royale]]''. In this case, producer [[Charles K. Feldman]] initially intended to make a serious film, but decided that it would not be able to compete with the established series of Bond films. Hence, he decided to parody the series.&lt;ref&gt;Barnes, A. &amp; Hearn, M. (1997) ''Kiss kiss bang bang: the unofficial James Bond film companion'', Batsford, p. 63 {{ISBN|9780713481822}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Poetic parodies==
[[Kenneth Baker, Baron Baker of Dorking|Kenneth Baker]] considered poetic parody to take five main forms.&lt;ref&gt;K. Baker ed., ''Unauthorized Versions'' (London 1990) Introduction p. xx–xxii&lt;/ref&gt;
# The first was to use parody to attack the author parodied, as in [[J K Stephen]]'s mimicry of [[Wordsworth]], “Two voices are there: one is of the deep....And one is of an old half-witted sheep.”&lt;ref&gt;K. Baker ed., ''Unauthorized Versions'' (London 1990) p. 429&lt;/ref&gt;
# The second was to pastiche the author's style, as with [[Henry Reed (poet)|Henry Reed]]'s parody of [[T. S. Eliot]], ''Chard Whitlow'': “As we get older we do not get any younger....”&lt;ref&gt;K. Baker ed., ''Unauthorized Versions'' (London 1990) p. 107&lt;/ref&gt;
# The third type reversed (and so undercut) the sentiments of the poem parodied, as with [[Monty Python]]'s ''All Things Dull and Ugly''.
# A fourth approach was to use the target poem as a matrix for inserting unrelated (generally humorous) material&amp;nbsp;– “To have it out or not? That is the question....Thus dentists do make cowards of us all.”&lt;ref&gt;K. Baker ed., ''Unauthorized Versions'' (London 1990) p. 319&lt;/ref&gt;
# Finally, parody may be used to attack contemporary/topical targets by utilizing the format of a well-known piece of verse: “O [[Salman Rushdie|Rushdie]], Rushdie, it's a vile world” ([[Cat Stevens]]).&lt;ref&gt;K. Baker ed., ''Unauthorized Versions'' (London 1990) p. 355&lt;/ref&gt;

A further, more constructive form of poetic parody is one that links the contemporary poet with past forms and past masters through affectionate parodying&amp;nbsp;– thus sharing poetic codes while avoiding some of the [[anxiety of influence]].&lt;ref&gt;S. Cushman ed., ''The Princeton Encyclopedia of Poetry and Poetics'' (Princeton 2012) p. 1003&lt;/ref&gt;

More aggressive in tone are playground poetry parodies, often attacking authority, values and culture itself in a carnivalesque rebellion:&lt;ref&gt;J. Thomas, ''Poetry's Playground'' (2007) p. 45-52&lt;/ref&gt; “Twinkle, Twinkle little star,/ Who the hell do you think you are?”&lt;ref&gt;Quoted in S. Burt ed., ''The Cambridge History of American Poetry'' (Cambridge 2014)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Self-parody==
{{Main|Self-parody}}
A subset of parody is ''[[self-parody]]'' in which artists parody their own work (as in [[Ricky Gervais]]'s ''[[Extras (sitcom)|Extras]]'') or distinctions of their work (such as [[Antonio Banderas]]'s [[Puss in Boots (Shrek)|Puss in Boots]] in the ''[[Shrek]]'' [[sequel]]s) or an artist or genre repeats elements of earlier works to the point that originality is lost.

==Copyright issues==
{{see also|Plagiarism}}

Although a parody can be considered a [[derivative work]] of a pre-existing, copyrighted work, some countries have ruled that parodies can fall under [[copyright limitation]]s such as [[fair dealing]], or otherwise have fair dealing laws that include parody in their scope.

===United States===
Parodies are protected under the [[fair use]] doctrine of [[United States copyright law]], but the defense is more successful if the usage of an existing copyrighted work is transformative in nature, such as being a critique or commentary upon it.

In ''[[Campbell v. Acuff-Rose Music, Inc.]]'', the [[Supreme Court of the United States|Supreme Court]]  ruled that a rap parody of "[[Oh, Pretty Woman]]" by [[2 Live Crew]] was fair use, as the parody was a distinctive, transformative work designed to ridicule the original song, and that "even if 2 Live Crew's copying of the original's first line of lyrics and characteristic opening bass riff may be said to go to the original's 'heart,' that heart is what most readily conjures up the song for parody, and it is the heart at which parody takes aim."

In 2001, the [[United States Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit|Eleventh Circuit Court of Appeals]], in ''[[Suntrust v. Houghton Mifflin]]'', upheld the right of [[Alice Randall]] to publish a parody of ''[[Gone with the Wind (novel)|Gone with the Wind]]'' called ''[[The Wind Done Gone]]'', which told the same story from the point of view of [[Scarlett O'Hara]]'s slaves, who were glad to be rid of her.

In 2007, the [[United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit|Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals]] denied a fair use defense in the ''Dr. Seuss Enterprises v. Penguin Books'' case. Citing the ''Campbell v. Acuff-Rose'' decision, they found that a [[satire]] of the [[O. J. Simpson murder case|O.J. Simpson murder trial]] and parody of ''[[The Cat in the Hat]]'' had infringed upon the children's book because it did not provide a commentary function upon that work.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://fairuse.stanford.edu/Copyright_and_Fair_Use_Overview/chapter9/9-c.html|title=Summaries of Fair Use Cases|author=Richard Stim|work=Stanford Copyright and Fair Use Center}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=15758460119711775481&amp;hl=en&amp;as_sdt=2&amp;as_vis=1&amp;oi=scholarr|title=Google Scholar|work=google.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Canada===
{{update|type=section|Changes from the Copyright Modernization Act, 2012|date=September 2012}}
Under [[Canadian law]], although there is protection for [[fair dealing#Canada|Fair Dealing]], there is no explicit protection for parody and satire. In ''[[Canwest v. Horizon]]'', the publisher of the [[Vancouver Sun]] launched a [[lawsuit]] against a group which had published a pro-[[State of Palestine|Palestinian]] parody of the paper. Alan Donaldson, the judge in the case, [[court ruling|ruled]] that parody is not a [[legal defence|defence]] to a [[Canadian copyright law|copyright]] claim.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://thetyee.ca/Mediacheck/2008/12/11/CanwestSuit/|title=The Tyee&amp;nbsp;– Canwest Suit May Test Limits of Free Speech|date=11 December 2008|work=The Tyee}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===United Kingdom===
In 2006 the ''[[Gowers Review of Intellectual Property]]'' recommended that the UK should "create an exception to copyright for the purpose of caricature, parody or pastiche by 2008."&lt;ref&gt;The Stationery Office. (2006) Gowers Review of Intellectual Property. [Online]. Available at [http://www.official-documents.gov.uk/document/other/0118404830/0118404830.pdf official-documents.gov.uk] (Accessed: 22 February 2011).&lt;/ref&gt; Following the first stage of a two-part public consultation, the Intellectual Property Office reported that the information received "was not sufficient to persuade us that the advantages of a new parody exception were sufficient to override the disadvantages to the creators and owners of the underlying work. There is therefore no proposal to change the current approach to parody, caricature and pastiche in the UK."&lt;ref name="Gowers Second Stage Consultation"&gt;UK Intellectual Property Office. (2009) Taking Forward the Gowers Review of Intellectual Property: Second Stage Consultation on Copyright Exceptions. [Online]. Available at [http://www.ipo.gov.uk/consult-gowers2.pdf ipo.gov.uk] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110517005032/http://www.ipo.gov.uk/consult-gowers2.pdf |date=2011-05-17 }} (Accessed: 22 February 2011).&lt;/ref&gt;

However, following the Hargreaves Review in May 2011 (which made similar proposals to the Gowers Review) the Government broadly accepted these proposals.  The current law (effective from 1 October 2014), namely Section 30A&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/2014/2356/regulation/5/made|title=The Copyright and Rights in Performances (Quotation and Parody) Regulations 2014|website=Legislation.gov.uk|accessdate=3 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; of the [[Copyright, Designs and Patents Act 1988]], now provides an exception to infringement where there is fair dealing of the original work for the purpose of parody (or alternatively for the purpose of caricature or pastiche).  The legislation does not define what is meant by "parody", but the UK IPO&amp;nbsp;– the [[Intellectual Property Office (United Kingdom)]]&amp;nbsp;– suggests&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/359250/Exceptions_to_copyright_-_Guidance_for_creators_and_copyright_owners.pdf|format=PDF|title=Exceptions to copyright : Guidance for creators and copyright owners|website=Gov.uk|accessdate=3 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; that a "parody" is something that imitates a work
for humorous or satirical effect.  See also [[Fair dealing in United Kingdom law]].

==Internet culture==
Parody is a prominent genre in online culture, thanks in part to the ease with which digital texts may be altered, appropriated, and shared. Japanese kuso and Chinese e'gao are emblematic of the importance of parody in online cultures in Asia. Video mash-ups and other parodic memes, such as humorously-altered Chinese characters, have been particularly popular as a tool for political protest in the People's Republic of China, the government of which maintains an extensive censorship apparatus.&lt;ref&gt;Christopher Rea, "Spoofing (e’gao) Culture on the Chinese Internet.” In Humour in Chinese Life and Culture: Resistance and Control in Modern Times. Jessica Milner Davis and Jocelyn Chey, eds. Hong Kong: Hong Kong University Press, 2013, pp. 149–172&lt;/ref&gt; Chinese internet slang makes extensive use of puns and parodies on how Chinese characters are pronounced or written, as illustrated in the [https://chinadigitaltimes.net/space/Grass-Mud_Horse_Lexicon:_Browse_by_Topic Grass-Mud Horse Lexicon].

==Social and political uses==
[[File:I did not raise my girl to be a voter3.jpg|right|thumb|Satirical political cartoon that appeared in ''[[Puck (magazine)|Puck]]'' magazine, October 9, 1915. Caption "I did not raise my girl to be a voter" parodies the anti-[[World War I]] song "[[I Didn't Raise My Boy To Be A Soldier]]." A chorus of disreputable men support a lone anti-suffrage woman.]]
[[File:Reggie Brown by Gage Skidmore 2.jpg|thumb|left|[[Reggie Brown (impersonator)|Reggie Brown]], a voice actor and [[Barack Obama]] impersonator]]

Parody is a frequent ingredient in [[satire]] and is often used to make social and political points. Examples include [[Jonathan Swift|Swift]]'s "[[A Modest Proposal]]", which satirized English neglect of Ireland by parodying emotionally disengaged political tracts; and, recently, ''[[The Daily Show]]'' and ''[[The Colbert Report]]'', which parody a news broadcast and a talk show to satirize political and social trends and events.

On the other hand, the writer and frequent parodist [[Vladimir Nabokov]] made a distinction: "Satire is a lesson, parody is a game."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Appel | first1 = Alfred, Jr. | authorlink1 = Alfred Appel | last2 = Nabokov  | first2 = Vladimir | authorlink2 = Vladimir Nabokov | year = 1967 | title = An Interview with Vladimir Nabokov | journal = Wisconsin Studies in Contemporary Literature | volume = VIII | issue = 2 | pages = 127–152 | url = http://lib.ru/NABOKOW/Inter06.txt_with-big-pictures.html | accessdate = 28 Dec 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some events, such as a national tragedy, can be difficult to handle. Chet Clem, Editorial Manager of the news parody publication ''[[The Onion]]'', told ''[[Wikinews]]'' in an interview the questions that are raised when addressing difficult topics:
{{cquote|I know the [[September 11 attacks|September 11]] issue was an obviously very large challenge to approach.  Do we even put out an issue?  What is funny at this time in American history?  Where are the jokes?  Do people want jokes right now?  Is the nation ready to laugh again?  Who knows.  There will always be some level of division in the back room.  It’s also what keeps us on our toes.&lt;ref name=DS&gt;[[n:The Onion: An interview with 'America's Finest News Source'|An interview with The Onion]], David Shankbone, ''[[Wikinews]]'', November 25, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Parody is by no means necessarily satirical, and may sometimes be done with respect and appreciation of the subject involved, without being a heedless sarcastic attack.

Parody has also been used to facilitate dialogue between cultures or subcultures. Sociolinguist [[Mary Louise Pratt]] identifies parody as one of the "arts of the contact zone", through which marginalized or oppressed groups "selectively appropriate", or imitate and take over, aspects of more empowered cultures.&lt;ref&gt;Pratt (1991)&lt;/ref&gt;

Shakespeare often uses a series of parodies to convey his meaning. In the social context of his era, an example can be seen in ''[[King Lear]]'' where the [[Jester|fool]] is introduced with his [[Comb (anatomy)#Other|coxcomb]] to be a parody of the king.

In [[astrophysics]], the '''Phillips relationship''' is the relationship between the peak luminosity of a [[Type Ia supernova]] and the speed of luminosity evolution after maximum light. The relationship was independently
discovered by the American statistician and astronomer Bert Woodard Rust and the Soviet astronomer Yury Pavlovich Pskovskii in the 1970s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last = Rust | first = B. W. | title = The Use of Supernovae Light Curves for Testing the Expansion Hypothesis and Other Cosmological Relations | journal = [PhD thesis, University of Illinois] | url = http://www.iaea.org/inis/collection/NCLCollectionStore/_Public/06/179/6179223.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last = Pskovskii | first = Yu. P. | title = Light curves, color curves, and expansion velocity of type I supernovae as functions of the rate of brightness decline | journal = [[Astronomy Reports|Soviet Astronomy]] | volume = 21 | pages = 675 | date = 1977 | bibcode = 1977SvA....21..675P}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last = Pskovskii | first = Yu. P. | title = Photometric classification and basic parameters of type I supernovae | journal = [[Astronomy Reports|Soviet Astronomy]] | volume = 28 | pages = 658–664 | date = 1984 | bibcode = 1984SvA....28..658P}}&lt;/ref&gt; They found that the faster the supernova faded from maximum light, the fainter its peak magnitude was. As a main parameter characterizing the light curve shape, Pskovskii used β, the mean rate of decline in photographic brightness from maximum light to the point at which the luminosity decline rate changes. β is
measured in magnitudes per 100-day intervals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last = Pskovskii | first = Yu. P. | title = The Photometric Properties of Supernovae | journal = [[Astronomy Reports|Soviet Astronomy]] | volume = 11 | pages = 63–69 | date = 1967 | bibcode = 1967SvA....11...63P}}&lt;/ref&gt; Selection of this parameter is justified by the fact that, at that time, the probability of discovering a supernova before the maximum light, and obtain the full light curve, was small. Moreover, the existing light curves were mostly incomplete. On the other hand, to determine the decline after the maximum light was rather simple for most observed supernovae.

In the early 1980s CCD cameras appeared, and the number of SNe discoveries increased substantially. Moreover, the probability of discovering SNe before they reached maximum light and following their brightness evolution longer also increased. The first light curves of SNe Ia obtained using CCD photometry showed that some supernovae had faster decline rates than others. Later, the low luminosity Ia [[SN 1991bg]] with a fast decline rate was discovered.
All this motivated the American astronomer [[Mark M. Phillips]] to revise this relationship precisely during the course of the [[Calán/Tololo Supernova Survey]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last = Phillips | first = M. M. | authorlink = Mark M. Phillips | title = The absolute magnitudes of Type IA supernovae | journal = [[Astrophysical Journal|Astrophysical Journal Letters]] | volume = 413 | issue = 2 | pages = L105–L108 | date = 1993 | doi = 10.1086/186970 | bibcode = 1993ApJ...413L.105P}}&lt;/ref&gt; The correlation had been difficult to prove because Pskovskii's slope (β) parameter was difficult to measure with precision in practice, a necessary condition to prove the correlation. Rather than trying to determine the slope, Phillips used a simpler and more robust procedure that consisted in "measuring the total amount in magnitudes that the light curve decays from its peak brightness during some specified period following maximum light." It was defined as the decline in the ''B''-magnitude [[light curve]] from maximum light to the [[apparent magnitude|magnitude]] 15 days after ''B''-maximum, a parameter he called &lt;math&gt;\Delta{m}_{15}&lt;/math&gt;. The lead sentence of the final paragraph of Phillips' paper acknowledges "I am indebted to George Jacoby for suggesting the &lt;math&gt;\Delta{m}_{15}&lt;/math&gt; parameter as an alternative to Pskovskii's β."  The relation states that the maximum '''intrinsic''' B-band magnitude is given by

&lt;math&gt; M_\mathrm{max}(B) = -21.726 + 2.698 \Delta m_{15} (B). &lt;/math&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author = Rosswog | author2 =Bruggen | title = High Energy Astrophysics }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Phillips dedicated the journal article confirming Yuri Pskovskii's proposed correlation to Pskovskii, who died a few weeks after Phillips' evidence confirming the relationship was published.

It has been recast to include the evolution in multiple photometric bandpasses, with a significantly shallower slope&lt;ref&gt;Hamuy, M., Phillips, M. M., Maza, J., Suntzeff, N. B., Schommer, R. A., &amp; Aviles, R. 1995, ''Astronomical Journal'', 109, 1&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Riess, A. G., Press, W. H., &amp; Kirshner, R. P. 1996, ''AstrophysicsJournal'', 473, 88&lt;/ref&gt; and as a ''stretch'' in the time axis relative to a standard template.&lt;ref&gt;Perlmutter, S. A., &amp; et al.  1997, ''NATO ASIC Proc. 486: Thermonuclear Supernovae'', 749&lt;/ref&gt;
The relation is typically used to bring any Type Ia supernova peak magnitude to a [[standard candle]] value.

'''Plasma protein binding''' refers to the degree to which medications attach to [[protein]]s within the blood. A drug's efficiency may be affected by the degree to which it binds. The less bound a drug is, the more efficiently it can traverse cell membranes or diffuse. Common blood proteins that drugs bind to are [[human serum albumin]], [[lipoprotein]], [[glycoprotein]], and α, β‚ and γ [[globulin]]s.

==Binding(Drug Distribution) ==
A drug in blood exists in two forms: bound and unbound. Depending on a specific drug's affinity for plasma protein, a proportion of the drug may become bound to plasma proteins, with the remainder being unbound. If the protein binding is reversible, then a [[chemical equilibrium]] will exist between the bound and unbound states, such that:

::Protein + drug ⇌ Protein-drug complex

Notably, it is the unbound fraction which exhibits pharmacologic effects. It is also the fraction that may be metabolized and/or excreted. For example, the "fraction bound" of the [[anticoagulant]] [[warfarin]] is 97%.  This means that of the amount of warfarin in the blood, 97% is bound to plasma proteins.  The remaining 3% (the fraction unbound) is the fraction that is actually active and may be excreted. Note that this does not mean that 97% of the plasma proteins are bound with drug, however.

Protein binding can influence the drug's [[biological half-life]]. The bound portion may act as a reservoir or depot from which the drug is slowly released as the unbound form. Since the unbound form is being metabolized and/or excreted from the body, the bound fraction will be released in order to maintain equilibrium.

Since albumin is alkalotic, acidic and neutral drugs will primarily bind to [[Human serum albumin|albumin]].  If albumin becomes saturated, then these drugs will bind to [[lipoprotein]].  Basic drugs will bind to the acidic [[Orosomucoid|alpha-1 acid glycoprotein]].  This is significant because various medical conditions may affect the levels of albumin, alpha-1 acid glycoprotein, and lipoproteins.

==Impact of the altered protein binding==
Only the unbound fraction of the drug undergoes metabolism in the liver and other tissues. As the drug dissociates from the protein, more and more drug undergoes metabolism. Changes in the levels of free drug change the volume of distribution because free drug may distribute into the tissues leading to a decrease in plasma concentration profile. For the drugs which rapidly undergo metabolism, [[clearance (medicine)|clearance]] is dependent on the hepatic blood flow.  For drugs which slowly undergo metabolism, changes in the unbound fraction of the drug directly change the clearance of the drug.
: '''Note''': The most commonly used methods for measuring drug concentration levels in the plasma measure bound as well as unbound fractions of the drug.

The fraction unbound can be altered by a number of variables, such as the concentration of drug in the body, the amount and quality of plasma protein, and other drugs that bind to plasma proteins.  Higher drug concentrations would lead to a higher fraction unbound, because the plasma protein would be saturated with drug and any excess drug would be unbound.  If the amount of plasma protein is decreased (such as in [[catabolism]], [[malnutrition]], [[liver disease]], [[renal disease]]), there would also be a higher fraction unbound.  Additionally, the quality of the plasma protein may affect how many drug-binding sites there are on the protein.

===Drug interactions===
Using 2 drugs at the same time can sometimes affect each other's fraction unbound.  For example, assume that Drug A and Drug B are both protein-bound drugs.  If Drug A is given, it will bind to the plasma proteins in the blood.  If Drug B is also given, it can displace Drug A from the protein, thereby increasing Drug A's fraction unbound.  This may increase the effects of Drug A, since only the unbound fraction may exhibit activity.

Note that for Drug A, the % increase in unbound fraction is 100% – hence, Drug A's pharmacological effect can potentially double (depending on whether the free molecules get to their target before they are eliminated by metabolism or excretion).  This change in pharmacologic effect could have adverse consequences.

However, this effect is really only noticeable in closed systems where the pool of available proteins could potentially be exceeded by the number of drug molecules. Biological systems, such as humans and animals, are open systems where molecules can be gained, lost or redistributed and where the protein pool capacity is almost never exceeded by the number of drug molecules. A drug that is 99% bound means that 99% of the drug molecules are bound to blood proteins not that 99% of the blood proteins are bound with drug. When two, highly protein-bound drugs (A and B) are added into the same biological system it will lead to an initial small increase in the concentration of free drug A (as drug B ejects some of the drug A from its proteins). However, this free drug A is now more available for redistribution into the body tissues and/or for excretion. This means the total amount of drug in the system will decrease quite rapidly, keeping the free drug fraction (the concentration of free drug divided by the total drug concentration) constant and yielding almost no change in clinical effect &lt;ref&gt;https://bblearn.usask.ca/bbcswebdav/pid-1957823-dt-content-rid-9318990_2/courses/86742.201709/Toutain%20Free%20Drug%20vs%20Free%20Drug%20Fraction.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;.

The effects of drugs displacing each other and changing the clinical effect (though important in some examples) is vastly overestimated usually and a common example incorrectly used to display the importance of this effect is the anticoagulant [[Warfarin]]. Warfarin is highly protein-bound (&gt;95%) and has a low [[therapeutic index]]. Since a low therapeutic index indicates that there is a high risk of toxicity when using the drug, any potential increases in warfarin concentration could be very dangerous and lead to hemorrhage. In horses, it is very true that if warfarin and phenylbutazone are administered concurrently, the horse can develop bleeding issues which can be fatal. This is often explained as being due to the effect of phenylbutazone ejecting warfarin from its plasma protein, thus increasing the concentration of free warfarin and increasing its anticoagulant effect. However, the real problem is that phenylbutazone interferes with the liver's ability to metabolize warfarin so free warfarin cannot be metabolized properly or excreted. This leads to an increase in free warfarin and the resulting bleeding issues.

{{Computer security}}

'''Portable Document Format security''' is concerned with the protection of information and property from theft, corruption, and attack.  Its main purpose it to make sure information is productive and accessible to its intended users.   

== History ==
From its early stages of development in the 1990s,  PDF started including security features. Over the years, several threats have been clearly identified including the following:

* In 2000, a conceptual weakness was identified with the ability of Adobe reader to run malicious scripts related to a particular link. This attack used the XSS (Cross Site Scripting)
attack technique. 

* In 2001, ''Outlook PDFWorm'' (Trend Micro, 2000) was identified and spread through PDF documents as Microsoft Outlook email attachments. It appeared as a game running a malicious code imbedded in the document.&lt;ref&gt;Adobe Forums, [https://forums.adobe.com/thread/302989 Announcement: PDF Attachment Virus "Peachy"], 15 August 2001.&lt;/ref&gt;

* In 2003, the W32 Yourde virus that exploited a vulnerability in Acrobat 5.0.5 was discovered . A corrupted PDF document exploited a vulnerability in the JavaScript parsing engine to lead Acrobat into using plug-ins folders.

* Early PDF document security relied on a weak 40 bit encryption with methods to crack it readily available online. As a result, Adobe added a 128 bit encryption in May 2006 for better protection.  Later in december 2006, another critical XSS attack through PDF documents was discovered.

* On March 30, 2010, an Adobe Reader and Foxit Reader exploit that runs a malicious executable is identified.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://blogs.pcmag.com/securitywatch/2010/03/malicious_pdfs_execute_code_wi.php|title=Malicious PDFs Execute Code Without a Vulnerability|work=PCMAG}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Risks and vulnerabilities ==
Adobe  Reader and Acrobat products are supported by a large and complex code including several proprietary extensions. This apparent flexibility translates into a broad attack surface that is difficult for Adobe and anti-malware vendors to defend. For example, most PDF related tools allow their users to copy or print without paying attention to password or protection.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~dst/Adobe/Gallery/PDFsecurity.pdf  |title= How secure is PDF |author=Bryan Guignard}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.planetpdf.com/planetpdf/pdfs/pdf2k/01W/merz_securitykeynote.pdf |title= PDF Security Overview: Strengths and Weaknesses }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.macworld.com/article/1137343/pdf.html |title=Adobe admits new PDF password protection is weaker |author= Jeremy Kirk}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Vulnerabilities are quite common in Adobe Reader's long history with Adobe Systems providing appropriate solutions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.adobe.com/support/security/#readerwin |title=Security bulletins and advisories |publisher=Adobe |date= |accessdate=2010-02-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Most PDF security concerns arise around the use of the full version of Adobe Acrobat whereas PDF documents are only the object of security analysis that is restricted to attacks and vulnerabilities. 

Like HTML files, PDF files are also vulnerable. Here, vulnerability of a PDF document means its susceptibility to flaw,  attackers access to the flaw, and their capability to exploit the flaw.  Later, Adobe introduced a function that allows the original author to audit file usage.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.adobe.com/support/techdocs/332208.html New features and issues addressed in the Acrobat 7.0.5 Update (Acrobat and Adobe Reader for Windows and Mac OS)]&lt;/ref&gt; However, the use of restrictions that a document author places on a PDF document is not secure, and cannot be assured once the file is distributed.

=== Exploits ===
{{see also|Adobe Acrobat#Security}}

The PDF standard allowing related documents to be imbedded with JavaScript is indeed a vulnerability that can be prevented by disabling the script execution and inhibit such exploits. This action is far more helpful than any support from compatibility.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.grc.com/sn/sn-187.txt Steve Gibson - SecurityNow Podcast]&lt;/ref&gt; 

Around 2013, [[FireEye]], a cybersecurity company, discovered that attackers use a remote code execution exploit called [[Zero-day (computing)|Zero-day]] exploit that bypasses the sandbox anti-exploitation and works against the Adobe Reader 9, 10 and 11.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pcworld.com/article/2027946/researchers-zero-day-pdf-exploit-affects-adobe-reader-11-earlier-versions.html |title=Researchers: Zero-day PDF exploit affects Adobe Reader 11, earlier versions |publisher=[[PCWolrd]] |author= Lucian Constantin   |date=February 13, 2013   |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pcworld.com/article/2027946/researchers-zero-day-pdf-exploit-affects-adobe-reader-11-earlier-versions.html |title=Researchers: Zero-day PDF exploit affects Adobe Reader 11, earlier versions |publisher=[[PCWolrd]] |author= Lucian Constantin   |date=February 14, 2013   |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As an example effort to reduce exploitation, Adobe Systems has implemented auto-update features, developed the Adobe Reader protected mode, a secure sandbox for displaying PDF documents and restricting external malware calls. In addition, Return-oriented programming (ROP) and stolen digital certificates have played significant roles in recent [[Exploit (computer security)|exploits]].

Updating Adobe Reader or Acrobat to the latest version, enabling auto-update, disabling Javascript or simply considering alternative PDF readers.Finally, educating users about the risks of attacks from PDF documents.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url=http://www.pdflib.com/knowledge-base/pdf-security/recommendations/ |title=PDFlib - PDF Security - Security Recommendations |quote=AES-256 according to PDF 1.7 Adobe Extension Level 3 (Acrobat 9) should be avoided because it contains a weakness in the password checking algorithm.  |accessdate=2012-09-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Solutions ==
Over time, [[Adobe Systems]] has provided solutions to deal with new vulnerabilities as soon as they were discovered in various versions of Adobe Reader.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.adobe.com/content/dam/Adobe/en/products/acrobat/axi/pdfs/reader-acrobat-xi-security.pdf  |title=PDF security reaches new levels with Adobe Reader XI and Adobe Acrobat XI  |publisher=[[Adobe Systems]] |date= |accessdate=2010-02-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;  For example, the company publishes security bulletins in their ''Security bulletins and advisories'' page.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.adobe.com/support/security/#readerwin |title=Security bulletins and advisories |publisher=Adobe |date= |accessdate=2010-02-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.adobe.com/support/security/|title=Security Bulletins and Advisories|work=adobe.com|publisher=[[Adobe Systems]]|accessdate=4 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Robust means of [[information rights management]] like [[Adobe LiveCycle]] [[Adobe LiveCycle#LiveCycle Rights Management ES4 | Rights Management]] and Locklizard PDF DRM&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.infosecurity-magazine.com/news/locklizard-develops-zero-footprint-solution-for/ |title=LockLizard Develops Zero Footprint Solution for PDF Security }}&lt;/ref&gt; are some of the commercial solutions offered on the market. They restrict document access and also reliably enforce [[File system permissions | permissions]] better than standard security handlers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.locklizard.com/pdf_security_drm/ |title=PDF DRM Security Software for Adobe Document Protection}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== DRM ===
PDF documents are also subject to the application of  [[digital rights management]] (DRM) technology.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/technology/6337781.stm |title=Q&amp;A: What is DRM? |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.locklizard.com/pdf_security_drm/   |title=PDF DRM Security – 10 things you should know |publisher= Locklizard}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The purpose of DRM  is to prevent the unauthorized use and control access to corporate documents, limit copying, editing and printing.  The application of Enterprise digital rights management technology to control access to corporate documents in PDF format is also quite common.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.networkworld.com/news/tech/2006/121806techupdate.html|title="DRM vs. ERM: Battle to Control Data", Network World|accessdate=2008-04-02|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080303235632/http://www.networkworld.com/news/tech/2006/121806techupdate.html|archivedate=2008-03-03|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; This technology also known as IRM ([[Information Rights Management]]), integrates with [[content management]] system software and is generally intended to prevent the unauthorized use of private and confidential documents.

=== Encryption ===
PDFs may be [[encrypted]] so that a password is needed to view or edit the contents. The PDF Reference defines both 40-bit and 128-bit encryption, both making use of a complex system of [[RC4]] and [[MD5]]. The PDF Reference also defines ways that third parties can define their own encryption systems for PDF. The PDF Reference has technical details for an end-user overview.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://createpdf.adobe.com/cgi-feeder.pl/help_security?BP=&amp;LOC=en_US |title=Create Adobe PDF Online - Security Settings Help |publisher=Createpdf.adobe.com |date= |accessdate=2010-02-21 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091223033059/http://createpdf.adobe.com/cgi-feeder.pl/help_security?BP=&amp;LOC=en_US |archivedate=2009-12-23 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  

=== Watermarking and others ===
Adobe Systems recommends that any PDF application concerned with security, implements a combination of application sandboxing, data execution protection including non-executable memory, address space layout randomization, and stack cookies as defense mechanism.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url=http://www.locklizard.com/pdf_watermarking/  |title=PDF Watermarking Securiy: Add PDF Watermark with PDF Document Watermarking Creator Software   |publisher=Locklizard  |quote=   |accessdate=2012-09-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Watermarking is often used for enforcing copyright on PDF files and  help provide evidence in legal situations rather than as a restriction. A standard pdf watermark works  well for PDF distribution because its of its consistent appearance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.locklizard.com/pdf_watermarking/   |title=Add PDF Watermark with PDF Document Watermarking Creator Software  |publisher= Locklizard}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A number of applications (ex. Google Chrome) provides secure internal viewing that protects content against malicious [[Exploit (computer security)|exploit]]. This technique is called [[Sandbox (computer security)|sandboxing]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.usenix.org/publications/library/proceedings/sec96/full_papers/goldberg/goldberg.pdf |title=A Secure Environment for Untrusted Helper Applications (Confining the Wily Hacker)|author1=Ian Goldberg |author2=David Wagner |author3=Randi Thomas |author4=Eric Brewer  |last-author-amp=yes |work=Proceedings of the Sixth USENIX UNIX Security Symposium|year=1996|accessdate=25 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Geier |first=Eric |url=http://www.techhive.com/article/247416/how_to_keep_your_pc_safe_with_sandboxing.html |title=How to Keep Your PC Safe With Sandboxing |publisher=TechHive |date=2012-01-16 |accessdate=2014-07-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.dmst.aueb.gr/dds/pubs/conf/2001-Freenix-Sandbox/html/sandbox32final.pdf |title=Sandboxing Applications|year=2001|accessdate=7 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8740">In [[project management]], a '''schedule''' is a listing of a [[project]]'s [[Milestone (project management)|milestones]], [[task (project management)|activities]], and [[deliverable]]s, usually with intended start and finish dates.  Those items are often [[Estimation (project management)|estimated]] by other information included in the project schedule of [[resource allocation]], [[budget]], task [[duration (project management)|duration]], and linkages of [[Dependency (project management)|dependencies]] and scheduled events.  A schedule is commonly  used in the [[project planning]] and [[project portfolio management]] parts of [[project management]].  Elements on a schedule may be closely related to the [[work breakdown structure]] (WBS) [[Work breakdown structure#Terminal element|terminal element]]s, the [[Statement of work]], or a [[Contract Data Requirements List]].

==Overview==
In many industries, such as engineering and construction, the development and maintenance of the project schedule is the responsibility of a full-time scheduler or team of schedulers, depending on the size and the scope of the project.  The techniques of scheduling are well developed&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mosaicprojects.com.au/PDF_Papers/P042_History%20of%20Scheduing.pdf A Brief History of Scheduling (PDF)]&lt;/ref&gt; but inconsistently applied throughout industry.  Standardization and promotion of scheduling best practices are being pursued by the [[Association for the Advancement of Cost Engineering]] (AACE), the [[Project Management Institute]] (PMI),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

&lt;/ref&gt; purposes.

Project management is not limited to industry; the average person can use it to organize their own life.  Some examples are:
* Homeowner renovation project
* Keeping track of all the family activities
* Coaching a team
* Planning a vacation
* Planning a wedding

Some project management software programs provide templates, lists, and example schedules to help their users with creating their schedule.

== Methods ==

Before a project schedule can be created, the schedule maker should have a work breakdown structure (WBS), an effort estimate for each task, and a resource list with availability for each [[Resource (project management)|resource]]. If these components for the schedule are not available, they can be created with a consensus-driven estimation method like [[Wideband Delphi]]. The reason for this is that a schedule itself is an estimate: each date in the schedule is estimated, and if those dates do not have the buy-in of the people who are going to do the work, the schedule will be inaccurate.&lt;ref&gt;Stallman, Greene, [http://www.stellman-greene.com/aspm/content/view/18/38/ Applied Software Project Management] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130624124503/http://www.stellman-greene.com/aspm/content/view/18/38/ |date=2013-06-24 }}  O'Reilly press, Nov 2005&lt;/ref&gt;

To develop a project schedule, the following needs to be completed:&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web
| url = https://www.geniusproject.com/guide/beginner-guide-project-scheduling/getting-started
| title = Beginner's Guide to Project Scheduling
| publisher = Genius Project
| accessdate = 15 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Project scope
* Sequence of activities
* Tasks grouped into 5 project phases (conception, definition &amp; planning, launch, performance, close)
* Task dependencies map
* [[Critical path analysis]]
* Project milestones

In order for a project schedule to be healthy, the following criteria must be met:&lt;ref&gt;Cutting, Thomas, [http://www.pmhut.com/cultivating-a-healthy-project-schedule Cultivating a Healthy Project Schedule], PM Hut (Last accessed 8 November 2009).&lt;/ref&gt;

* The schedule must be constantly (weekly works best) updated.
* The [[Earned Value Management|EAC (Estimation at Completion)]] value must be equal to the baseline value.
* The remaining effort must be appropriately distributed among [[Project team|team]] members (taking vacations into consideration).

The schedule structure may closely follow and include citations to the index of work breakdown structure or deliverables, using decomposition or templates to describe the activities needed to produce the deliverables defined in the WBS.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web

'''Schola Gregoriana Pragensis''' (English: ''The Gregorian School of Prague'') is an ''[[a cappella]]'' [[male voice choir]] from the [[Czech Republic]], founded in 1987 by '''David Eben'''. Their core repertoire consists of [[Gregorian chant]], [[Bohemia]]n [[plainchant]], and early [[polyphony]], but they also perform modern works including some composed for them.

==Description==

===Schola Gregoriana Pragensis===
The '''Schola Gregoriana Pragensis''' is an award winning choir from the Czech republic with primary focus on Gregorian chant and Bohemian plainchant.  The choir formed in 1987 under the direction of David Eben and was restricted in its repertoire to only [[liturgical]] music for the first two years.  Since the [[Velvet Revolution]] of 1989, the choir has extended its repertoire to include a variety of sacred music, with particular focus on Gregorian chant ([[monophonic]] Latin liturgical music) and early polyphony.

The choir has won several awards, including the Choc du monde de le musique, 10 de Repertoire and [[Golden Harmony (Zlatá Harmonie)]].&lt;ref name="supraphon"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.supraphon.com/en/artists/?item=47 |website=[[Supraphon]] |title=Schola Gregoriana Pragensis |accessdate=5 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since inception they have toured a variety of countries.

Of particular importance is the choir's work in researching and performing Bohemian [[plainchant]] and early polyphony.{{citation needed|reason="Of particular importance" needs to be backed up by a reliable source|date=April 2016}}

The choir has between six and nine members with a repertoire of various sacred music.  They have toured many countries, including Japan, Israel, Norway, Sweden, Italy, Spain, France, Germany, Austria, Belgium, the Netherlands, Luxembourg, Switzerland, Slovakia, Hungary and Poland.&lt;ref name="supraphon" /&gt;

Their work in the interpretation of medieval music, with particular focus on Bohemian plainsong, is particularly significant with a focus on the symbolism of [[neumatic]] notation from the 10th and 11th centuries.{{citation needed|reason="particularly significant" needs to be backed up by a reliable source|date=April 2016}}  Performances feature the original [[Bohemian]] plainchant tradition, including the earliest examples of polyphony.  In addition they have performed music from 14th and 15th century and more modern compositions, including some written specifically for the group.

They have produced numerous recordings under the [[Supraphon]] and other labels.

The choir has participated in early music festivals, including the Festival Early Music at Utrecht in 2014.&lt;ref name="Review"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.musica-dei-donum.org/concert_reviews/FOMU2014.html|title= Concert review from Festival Early Music Utrecht 2014|publisher= Musica Dei Donum|quote=With the concert of the Schola Gregoriana Pragensis we moved forward almost two centuries. This ensemble focuses on early plainchant and polyphony from Bohemia.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The work of David Eban and the choir has featured in Czech academic publications related to musicology.&lt;ref name="JournalArticleKucirkova"&gt;{{cite journal | last = Kučírková | first = Kristýna | date = 2007 | title = Schola Gregoriana Pragensis versus Svatomichalská gregoriánská schola aneb Dva způsoby poučené interpretace | url = http://www.muni.cz/research/publications/743334 | journal = Teoretické reflexe hudební výchovy | publisher = [[Masarykova univerzita]] | location = [[Brno]] | language = Czech | volume = 3 | issue = 1 | issn = 1803-1331 | access-date= 5 March 2016 }} Title in English: ''Schola Gregoriana Pragensis versus Svatomichalská gregoriánská schola, two ways of interpretation''&lt;/ref&gt;

==Preface==
Pilgrimage is not uncommon to most major religions of the world. The [[Sikh]]s, in their thousands, visit [[Pakistan]] each year to celebrate the birth anniversary of their founder, [[Guru Nanak]], at [[Nankana Sahib]], his birthplace.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bbc.co.uk/schools/religion/sikhism/gurunanak.shtml The Birthday of Guru Nanak – 13 November 2008].

SGPC (2001-08-20). Retrieved on 2011-12-14.&lt;/ref&gt; It is hoped that it will serve as an effective guide to assist and encourage prospective pilgrims to visit these shrines.

For non-Sikhs and students of comparative religions, the authors hope the guide will provide readily available information as an introduction to the Sikh faith and its philosophy. But above all, it will provide to everyone, Guru Nanak’s universal [[Message of Guru Granth Sahib|message of love, peace and brotherhood]], and the emphasis on the [[Three pillars of Sikhism|worship of one God]].

The chapter on the [[Sikh Confederacy|Sikh Raj]] gives some background to the Sikhs’ history and their present political status. Some of the recent events have been cited in passing in one or two places where they have been of historical importance and significance in the context of references made in the text.

The '''Stein Rokkan Prize for Comparative Social Science Research''' is an academic honour awarded by the [[International Science Council]] (ISC), the [[University of Bergen]] and the [[European Consortium for Political Research]] (ECPR), in memory of the [[Political science|political scientist]] and [[Sociology|sociologist]] [[Stein Rokkan]] (prior to the 2018 formation of the International Science Council from the merger of the [[International Social Science Council]] (ISSC) and the [[International Council for Science]], the prize was awarded by the International Social Science Council).&lt;ref name="ISC"&gt;{{cite web|title=Call for nominations: Stein Rokkan prize for comparative social science research|url=https://council.science/current/news/call-for-nominations-stein-rokkan-prize-for-comparative-social-science-research|website=International Science Council|accessdate=21 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ISSC"&gt;{{cite web|title=Stein Rokkan|url=http://www.worldsocialscience.org/activities/scientific-prizes/stein-rokkan/|website=International Social Science Council|accessdate=3 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is awarded to scholars making "a very substantial and original contribution in comparative social science research".&lt;ref name="ISC" /&gt; These contributions can be in the form of book-length, unpublished manuscripts, published books, or collections of works published no more than two years prior to the award year. The prize is awarded annually and is worth $5000.&lt;ref name="ISC" /&gt;

According to a reputation survey conducted in 2013 and 2014, the Stein Rokkan Prize is the second most prestigious international academic award in political science, after the [[Johan Skytte Prize in Political Science]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=IREG Observatory on Academic Ranking and Excellence|title=IREG List of International Academic Awards|publisher=IREG Observatory on Academic Ranking and Excellence|location=Brussels|url=http://ireg-observatory.org/en/pdfy/IREG-list-academic-awards-EN.pdf|accessdate=3 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Zheng|first1=Juntao|last2=Liu|first2=Niancai|title=Mapping of important international academic awards|journal=Scientometrics|date=2015|volume=104|pages=763-791|doi=10.1007/s11192-015-1613-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; A reputation survey conducted in 2018 found the Stein Rokkan Prize to be the most prestigious interdisciplinary award in the social sciences (jointly with the [[Holberg Prize]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Jiang|first1=Fan|last2=Liu|first2=Niancai|title=The hierarchical status of international academic awards in social sciences|journal=Scientometrics|date=2018|doi=10.1007/s11192-018-2928-y}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''The Quantum Vacuum: An Introduction to Quantum Electrodynamics''''' is a [[physics]] [[textbook]] authored by [[Peter W. Milonni]] in 1993. The book provides a careful and thorough treatment of [[zero-point energy]], [[spontaneous emission]], the [[Casimir Force|Casimir]], [[van der Waals forces]], [[Lamb shift]] and [[Electron magnetic moment|anomalous magnetic moment of the electron]] at a level of detail not found in other introductory texts to [[quantum electrodynamics]].

The first chapter, ''Zero‐Point Energy in Early Quantum Theory'', was originally published in 1991 in the ''[[American Journal of Physics]]''.

In 2008 Milonni received the [[Max Born Award]] "For exceptional contributions to the fields of theoretical optics, laser physics and quantum mechanics, and for dissemination of scientific knowledge through authorship of a series of outstanding books".

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5497">The '''Thomas More Institute''' (TMI) is a secular academic institution located in [[Montreal]], Quebec, Canada that offers a program of university level studies in the [[liberal arts]]. There is an option to earn a Bachelor of Arts in affiliation with [[Bishop's University]].

== History ==
TMI was founded in Montreal in 1945 by a group of people, most of them in their twenties, including [[Charlotte Tansey]], Martin O'Hara, Stan Machnik, and Veronica Smyth.&lt;ref&gt;[https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=2dEtAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=3EgDAAAAIBAJ&amp;dq=tansey%20machnik&amp;pg=2269%2C586577 "Spirit of Girl in Twenties Spells Success for Adult Education Inst."], ''Manitoba Ensign'', February 4, 1950.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Lisa Fitterman, [http://v1.theglobeandmail.com/servlet/story/LAC.20100906.OBCHARLOTTTETANSEYATL/BDAStory/BDA/deaths "Dedicated to the pursuit of lifelong learning: Founder of Thomas More Institute for Adult Education had fierce vision and passion for knowledge]", ''[[The Globe and Mail]]'', September 6, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; The aim was to provide opportunities for lifelong learning and liberal arts education for adults.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Overview|url=http://www.thomasmore.qc.ca/about-2/overview/|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130915102954/http://www.thomasmore.qc.ca/about-2/overview/|archivedate=2013-09-15|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1950, TMI established the Workers' School, which offered evening classes in "Human Rights and Labour Unions," "The Rise of Labour Movements," and "Talking at Meetings," training workers to become union members.  The Institute received a federal charter in 1959.&lt;ref&gt;[https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=a0wwAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=fagFAAAAIBAJ&amp;dq=thomas-more-institute&amp;pg=5401%2C4209821 "Thomas More Institute Gets Federal Charter"], ''[[Montreal Gazette]]'', May 20, 1959.&lt;/ref&gt;

Today, annually, the Institute has more than 600 registrations and 35-40 new courses. The adult students are of all ages, from those in their early 20s to several over 90 years of age.

== Teaching method ==
TMI’s teaching is inspired by the [[Socratic method]]. Instead of lectures, TMI offers discussions guided by trained leaders and based upon carefully chosen and sequenced texts representing different perspectives on the questions each group has come together to explore. 
Although they may have special knowledge in a particular field the leaders do not lecture; the text is the professor. The discussion team only asks questions to channel the conversation.  Participants learn to listen to one another; people of all ages and all backgrounds coming together to exchange their views on what a reading means to them. TMI’s method requires critical thinking, clear references to common terms, and respect for alternate views. The challenge in TMI courses is not for students to agree, or come to a consensus, but to embrace new ways of thinking that go beyond individual bias.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Teaching Philosophy|url=http://www.thomasmore.qc.ca/about-2/teaching-philosophy/|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130916080355/http://www.thomasmore.qc.ca/about-2/teaching-philosophy/|archivedate=2013-09-16|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Seniors' Outreach Program ==

A climate '''tipping point''' is a point when a [[global climate]] changes from one given stable state to another stable state, much as when a wine glass, after being pushed from its base, finally tips over.  After the tipping point has been passed, a transition to a new state occurs. The tipping event may be irreversible, much like the spilling out of the wine originally contained in the glass: standing up the glass will not put the wine back.

==Definition==
The ''[[IPCC AR5]]'' report stated that precise levels of climate change sufficient to trigger a tipping point, defined as a threshold for abrupt and irreversible change, remain uncertain, and that the risk associated with crossing multiple tipping points increases with rising temperature.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://ipcc-wg2.gov/AR5/images/uploads/WG2AR5_SPM_FINAL.pdf|title=Climate change 2014, Impacts, Adaptation and Vulnerability|year=2014|author=IPCC AR5 WGII|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150514034430/http://ipcc-wg2.gov/AR5/images/uploads/WG2AR5_SPM_FINAL.pdf|archivedate=2015-05-14|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the context of climate change, an "adaptation tipping point" has been defined as "the threshold value or specific boundary condition where ecological, technical, economic, spatial or socially acceptable limits are exceeded."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Ahmed|first=Farhana|last2=Khan|first2=M Shah Alam|last3=Warner|first3=Jeroen|last4=Moors|first4=Eddy|last5=Terwisscha Van Scheltinga|first5=Catharien|date=2018-06-28|title=Integrated Adaptation Tipping Points (IATPs) for urban flood resilience|url=http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/0956247818776510|journal=Environment and Urbanization|language=en|pages=095624781877651|doi=10.1177/0956247818776510|issn=0956-2478}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Outline==
[[Global warming]] proceeds because of changes to the composition of gases in the [[Earth's atmosphere]] and Oceans by the emission of [[greenhouse gas]]es such as [[carbon dioxide]] and [[methane]]. As warming proceeds, it brings about changes to the [[natural environment]] which may result in other changes. For example, warming may begin to melt the [[Greenland ice sheet]] and/or [[West Antarctic Ice Sheet#Potential collapse|West Antarctic Ice Sheet]]. At some level of temperature rise, the melt of the entire [[ice sheet]] will become inevitable; but the ice sheet itself may persist for millennia {{Citation needed|date=September 2013}}.  A tipping point may be passed without any immediately obvious consequences, nor any acceleration of the warming process. Carbon dioxide {{as of|2012|May|lc=y}} made up 396.18 [[parts per million|ppm]] of Earth's atmosphere&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=ftp://ftp.cmdl.noaa.gov/ccg/co2/trends/co2_mm_mlo.txt | title=NOAA ESRL DATA | publisher=[[NOAA]] | date=7 May 2012 | accessdate=9 May 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and as of 2016 makes up 403.3 [[parts per million|ppm]] of Earth's atmosphere&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=https://www.engadget.com/2017/10/31/scientists-cant-explain-a-worrying-rise-in-methane-levels/ | title=Worrying Rise | publisher=[[WMO]] | date=31 Oct 2017 | accessdate=31 Oct 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt;.

Hansen]] said that this tipping point had already been reached in April 2008 when the {{CO2}} level was 385 ppm. (Hansen states 350 ppm as the upper limit.)  "Further global warming of 1[[Celsius|°C]] defines a critical threshold. Beyond that we will likely see changes that make [[Earth]] a different planet than the one we know."&lt;ref&gt;[http://afp.google.com/article/ALeqM5g2Wkbo6PcynAVeJzSPWDQZaWAI8g Earth in crisis, warns NASA's top climate scientist] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080412094147/http://afp.google.com/article/ALeqM5g2Wkbo6PcynAVeJzSPWDQZaWAI8g |date=2008-04-12 }} [[PhysOrg.com]], April 07, 2008 . Accessed August 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;  He has further suggested potential projections of [[runaway climate change]] on Earth, in his book ''[[Storms of My Grandchildren]]''.

Some scientists and other specialists sometimes express concern about global warming and irreversible tipping points, and use metaphors such as "the door is closing"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Luderer|first1=Gunnar|last2=Pietzcker|first2=Robert C|last3=Bertram|first3=Christoph|last4=Kriegler|first4=Elmar|last5=Meinshausen|first5=Malte|last6=Edenhofer|first6=Ottmar|title=Economic mitigation challenges: how further delay closes the door for achieving climate targets|journal=Environmental Research Letters|date=1 September 2013|volume=8|issue=3|pages=034033|doi=10.1088/1748-9326/8/3/034033|bibcode=2013ERL.....8c4033L}}&lt;/ref&gt; and warn of global [[famine|food]]{{Citation needed|date=September 2013}} and [[water shortages]]{{Citation needed|date=September 2013}}, hundreds of millions of people being displaced by [[rising sea levels]], famine, unhealthy and unlivable conditions, and storms becoming ever more frequent and severe worldwide.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.gainesville.com/article/20120422/OPINION03/120429946/-1/news?Title=Marshall-Saunders-Earth-to-mankind | title=Earth to mankind | last=Saunders | first=Marshall | publisher=The [[Gainesville Sun]] | date=22 April 2012 | accessdate=9 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Others have tried systematically to short-list large scale components of the Earth system that may be subject to tipping points, defining tipping points as a variety of phenomena, including the onset of [[positive feedback]], [[hysteresis]] effects, and the possible effect of statistical [[noise]] at critical points.&lt;ref name=Lenton08/&gt;

==Arctic sea ice==
In 2013, a study noted that there is an ongoing debate as to whether Arctic sea ice has already passed a "tipping point", or if it is likely in the future. They pointed out, ''"Several recent studies argue that the loss of summer sea ice does not involve an irreversible bifurcation, because it is highly reversible in models"''. The study identified in 2007 abrupt transition in seasonal variability which persisted since then, and made a distinction between [[Bifurcation theory|bifurcation]] and non-bifurcation ‘tipping point'.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=A recent tipping point in the Arctic sea-ice cover: abrupt and persistent increase in the seasonal cycle since 2007|year=2013|authors=Valerie N.

The '''United Nations Department of Economic and Social Affairs''' ('''UN DESA''') is part of the [[United Nations Secretariat]] and is responsible for the follow-up to major United Nations Summits and Conferences, as well as services to the [[United Nations Economic and Social Council]] and the Second and Third Committees of the [[United Nations General Assembly]].&lt;ref name="bio2007"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.un.org/esa/desa/ousg/#bioSection| title=About Mr. Wu Hongbo, Under-Secretary-General|accessdate=2007-09-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; UN DESA assists countries around the world in [[agenda-setting theory|agenda-setting]] and decision-making with the goal of meeting their economic, social and environmental challenges. It supports international cooperation to promote sustainable development for all, having as a foundation the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development and the 17 [[Sustainable Development Goals]] ('''SDGs''') as adopted by the UN General Assembly on 25 September 2015. In providing a broad range of analytical products, policy advice, and technical assistance, UN DESA effectively translates global commitments in the economic, social and environmental spheres into national policies and actions and continues to play a key role in monitoring progress towards internationally agreed-upon development goals. It is also a member of the [[United Nations Development Group]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.undg.org/index.cfm?P%3D13 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=15 May 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110511144047/http://www.undg.org/index.cfm?P=13 |archivedate=11 May 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Background ==
UN DESA is part of the UN Secretariat, which is funded through regular assessed contributions from Member States. The Department was reorganized into its present form in 1997. The Department is headed by Liu Zhenmin who assumed the office of Under-Secretary-General for Economic and Social Affairs, following his appointment to this position by Secretary-General António Guterres on 26 July 2017. Mr. Liu advises the Secretary-General on the three pillars of sustainable development—social economic and environmental, and nurtures key partnerships with governments, UN agencies and civil society organizations, including the SDGs. In directing and managing UN DESA, the Under-Secretary-General is supported by the Assistant Secretary-General for Economic Development and the Assistant Secretary-General for Policy Coordination and Inter-Agency Affairs.

== Mission ==
UN DESA’s mission is to promote [[sustainable development]] for all, focusing on the most vulnerable. This reflects a fundamental concern for equity and equality in countries large and small, developed and developing. It underscores the need for all stakeholders – governments, UN and other international organizations, civil society and the private sector – to do their part to improve economic and social well-being. This emphasis on equitable participation by all people and nations is what makes the United Nations unique and gives the development agenda its universal legitimacy.

== Function ==
UN DESA’s work programme can be categorized into three areas:

[[File:Sdgdesa.jpg|thumb|550px|frame|right|Adoption of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development on 25 September 2015]]

'''Norm-setting''': 
By facilitating major global conferences and summits, as mandated by [[UN Member States]], UN DESA assists countries as they find common ground and take decisive steps forward. Specifically, UN DESA is tasked with supporting deliberations in two major UN charter bodies: the UN General Assembly and UN Economic and Social Council (ECOSOC), including ECOSOC’s subsidiary bodies. 
In addition, UN DESA organises and supports consultations with a range of stakeholders, including the private sector and civil society. In this regard, UN DESA’s main priorities are promoting progress toward and strengthening accountability in achieving the SDGs. Furthermore, UN DESA is responsible for ensuring civil society engagement with the UN through the ECOSOC bodies.

'''Data and Analysis''':
UN DESA, generates, analyzes and compiles a wide range of official economic, social and environmental data and information on which Member States draw to review common problems and to take stock of policy options. One of the Department’s primary contributions is providing policy research and analysis for governments to use in their deliberations and decision-making&lt;ref name="SDG Indicators Website"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://unstats.un.org/sdgs/| title=DESA's flagship data resources and analytic publications|accessdate=2017-01-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
UN DESA is also the lead “author” Department of the UN Secretariat. The research and analytical work covers a range of economic, social and environmental issues. The Department  produces a host of flagship publications and major intergovernmental reports, which are essential to UN negotiations and global policy decisions. The publications are distributed in print and electronic formats around the world.

'''Capacity-building''':
UN DESA also advises Member States / Governments on implementing the policies and programmes developed at UN conferences back in their home countries. It assists interested Governments in translating policy frameworks developed in UN conferences and summits into programmes at the country level and, through technical assistance, helps build national capacities.

== Divisions ==
&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[Image:UN-DESA-ornigramm.jpg|thumb|240px|Overview of the UN DESA divisions]]  --&gt;
'''Economic Analysis and Policy Division:'''
The [https://www.un.org/development/desa/dpad/ Economic Analysis and Policy Division] is the think-tank for development economics within DESA and the main development research unit within the United Nations. The core functions of the Division include monitoring the global economic and social situation, promoting macroeconomic policy co-ordination and analyzing development trends to improve the implementation of the UN Development Agenda. It has recently been contributing an array of analyses and policy recommendations to the international debate on the global financial and economic crisis. The division is responsible for publishing the yearly [https://www.un.org/development/desa/dpad/document_gem/global-economic-monitoring-unit/world-economic-situation-and-prospects-wesp-report/world-economic-situation-and-prospects-wesp-full-report/ World Economic Situation and Prospects] and the [https://www.un.org/development/desa/dpad/document_gem/wess-report/wess-full-report/ World Economic Social Survey] reports, as well as a [https://www.un.org/development/desa/dpad/document_gem/global-economic-monitoring-unit/monthly-briefing-on-the-world-economic-situation-and-prospects/ monthly briefing] on the world economic landscape. It is also host to the [https://www.un.org/development/desa/dpad/our-work/committee-for-development-policy.html Committee for Development Policy], which monitors and benchmarks the [[Least Developed Countries]].

'''Division for Sustainable Development Goals:'''
The [https://www.un.org/esa/dsd/index.shtml Division for Sustainable Development Goals] supports intergovernmental processes related to sustainable development at the UN and serves as the substantive secretariat to the High-level Political Forum on sustainable development.
