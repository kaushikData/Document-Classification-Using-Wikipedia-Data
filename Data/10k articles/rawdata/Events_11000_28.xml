==The fire==
According to Saudi press reports, the blaze at Mecca Intermediate School No. 31 started at about 8am. The blaze began in a room on the top floor, apparently caused by an unattended cigarette.&lt;ref name=sacked&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/middle_east/1893349.stm|title=Cleric sacked over Saudi school fire|publisher=BBC News|date=25 March 2002| accessdate=2009-12-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=shock&gt;[http://www.arabnews.com/?page=1&amp;section=0&amp;article=13448&amp;d=13&amp;m=3&amp;y=2002&amp;pix=kingdom.jpg&amp;category=Shock Shock turns to outrage over school fire tragedy]. Kingdom Arab News. 13 March 2002&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=newsweek2002&gt;{{cite news|title=The Fire That Won't Die Out|url=http://www.thedailybeast.com/newsweek/2002/07/21/the-fire-that-won-t-die-out.html|accessdate=May 19, 2012|newspaper=Newsweek|date=July 21, 2002|author=Christopher Dickey|author2=Rod Nordland}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

As a result of the fire and ensuing rush to escape, 15 young girls died, and more than 50 were injured. Nine of the dead girls were Saudis; the rest were from [[Chad]], [[Egypt]], [[Guinea]], [[Niger]], and [[Nigeria]].&lt;ref name=shock/&gt; The majority of the deaths occurred when a staircase collapsed as the girls fled the building. The residential property upon which the school was built was overcrowded with 800 pupils. In addition, the building may have lacked proper safety infrastructure and equipment, such as fire stairs and alarms.&lt;ref name="hrw"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://hrw.org/english/docs/2002/03/15/saudia3801.htm|title=Saudi Arabia: Religious Police Role in School Fire Criticized|date=March 15, 2002|publisher=Human Rights Watch}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to at least two reports, members of the CPVPV, also known as ''Mutaween'', would not allow the girls to escape or to be saved from the fire because they were "not properly covered", and the mutaween did not want physical contact to take place between the girls and the civil defense forces for fear of sexual enticement, and variously that the girls were locked in by the police, or forced back into the building.&lt;ref&gt;Police 'stopped' fire rescue]. BBC News. 15 March, 2002&lt;/ref&gt; According to Hanny Megally, Executive Director of the Middle East and North Africa division of [[Human Rights Watch]], "women and girls may have died unnecessarily because of extreme interpretations of the Islamic dress code.&lt;ref name="hrw"/&gt;&lt;ref name="FadlKhaled"/&gt;
Civil Defense stated that the fire had extinguished itself before they arrived on the scene. CPVPV officers did appear to object to Civil Defense workers going into the building—Human Rights Watch quoted a Civil Defense officer as saying,
&lt;blockquote&gt;"Whenever the girls got out through the main gate, these people forced them to return via another. Instead of extending a helping hand for the rescue work, they were using their hands to beat us."&lt;/blockquote&gt;
The CPVPV denied the charges of beating or locking the gates but the incident and the accounts of witnesses were reported in Saudi newspapers such as the ''Saudi Gazette'' and ''Al-Iqtisaddiyya''. The result was a very rare public criticism of the group.&lt;ref name="FadlKhaled"&gt;Abou el Fadl, Khaled, ''The Great Theft'', (2005), pp. 250-2&lt;/ref&gt;

Also criticized was the General Presidency for Girls' Education (GPGE), which administers girl's schools in Saudi Arabia".&lt;ref name="hrw"/&gt;

==Inquiry==
An inquiry was launched by the Saudi government in wake of the deaths. The investigation was led by [[Abdul Majeed bin Abdulaziz Al Saud|Abdul Majeed]], the governor of Mecca. The [[Ministry of Interior (Saudi Arabia)|Interior Minister]], [[Nayef, Crown Prince of Saudi Arabia|Prince Nayef]], promised that those responsible for the deaths would be held accountable.&lt;ref name=naif&gt;[http://archive.arabnews.com/?page=1&amp;section=0&amp;article=13582&amp;d=18&amp;m=3&amp;y=2002&amp;pix=kingdom.jpg&amp;category=Kingdom Naif denies commission men prevented rescuers] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120418223557/http://archive.arabnews.com/?page=1&amp;section=0&amp;article=13582&amp;d=18&amp;m=3&amp;y=2002&amp;pix=kingdom.jpg&amp;category=Kingdom |date=2012-04-18 }}, [[Arab News]], March 18, 2002.&lt;/ref&gt; Nayef, at the time, stated that the deaths did not happen as a result of the fire, but rather the stampede caused by the panic. He acknowledged the presence of two mutaween and that they went there to prevent "mistreatment" of the girls. He said that they did not interfere with the rescue efforts and only arrived after everyone had left the building.&lt;ref name=naif/&gt;

On March 25, the inquiry concluded that while the fire had been caused by a stray cigarette, the religious educational authorities responsible for the school had neglected the safety of the pupils.&lt;ref name=sacked/&gt;  The inquiry found that the clerics had ignored warnings that overcrowding of the school could cause a fatal stampede. It also found that there was a lack of fire extinguishers and alarms in the building. Accordingly, the cleric in charge of the school was fired, and his office was merged with the Ministry of Education. The report dismissed allegations that the mutaween (of CPVPV) had prevented the girls from fleeing or made the death toll worse.&lt;ref name=sacked/&gt;

Many newspapers welcomed the merger of the agency responsible for girls' education with the Ministry of Education. Previously, the agencies had been separate and girls' education had been in the hands of the religious establishment. The newspapers saw the merger as a step towards "reform".&lt;ref name=sacked/&gt;

==Aftermath==
In the outrage over the deaths that followed, Crown Prince Abdullah removed girls' schools from the administration of the "General Presidency for Girls' Education"—an "autonomous government agency long controlled by conservative clerics"&lt;ref name="hrw"/&gt;—and put it under the Ministry of Education, which already controlled boys' schools.  In 1960, when girls' schools were first created in Saudi Arabia, they were put under the control of a separate administration dominated by conservatives as "a compromise to calm public opposition to allowing (not requiring) girls to attend school".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=House, Karen Elliott|title=On Saudi Arabia : Its People, past, Religion, Fault Lines and Future| publisher=Knopf|year=2012|page=152|quote=Girls' schools, at their creation in the 1960s, had been put under the control of the General Presidency for Girls' Education, an autonomous government agency controlled by conservative clerics, as a compromise to calm public opposition to allowing (not requiring) girls to attend school.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Similar incident==

There was another similar incident in 2014; a female student at a Saudi university died after being denied access to advanced medical assistance because the paramedics were male. Senior members of the faculty prevented the paramedics from entering primarily because the student was not fully covered and they did not want to get into trouble for having men in close proximity to her. This caused many Saudis to vent their anger and question the University's policies. &lt;ref&gt;http://english.alarabiya.net/en/News/middle-east/2014/02/06/Death-of-Saudi-female-student-raises-uproar.html&lt;/ref&gt;

The year '''513 BC''' was a year of the [[Roman calendar|pre-Julian Roman calendar]]. In the [[Roman Empire]], it was known as '''year 241 ''[[Ab urbe condita]]'' '''. The denomination 513 BC for this year has been used since the early medieval period, when the [[Anno Domini]] [[calendar era]] became the prevalent method in Europe for naming years.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6002">The '''Architect Africa Film Festival''' (AAFF) is a bi-annual architectural event held in South Africa by the Architects Collective of South Africa. For the duration of three weeks, the Architect Africa Film Festival travels to Johannesburg, Durban, Cape Town, Bloemfontein and Port Elizabeth where up to 25 international and local films featuring the built environment are screened to the public at central cinema complexes.&lt;ref&gt;[http://aaff.co.za/node/125 Architect Africa Film Festival] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110811014315/http://aaff.co.za/node/125 |date=August 11, 2011 }} Retrieved on 8 April 2011&lt;/ref&gt; This becomes the core event around which many additional activities take place, including two student competitions – the Tripod Architecture Photography Competition and the Moving Spaces Film Competition.&lt;ref&gt;[http://aaff.co.za/node/125 Architect Africa Film Festival] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110811014315/http://aaff.co.za/node/125 |date=August 11, 2011 }} Retrieved on 8 April 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

==Films==

The Architect Africa Film Festival screens films about built environments or urban landscapes or anything to do with modern city life. The films vary in length from short films to feature length. The films can be documentaries or fictional narratives. All of the films have something to say about cities and architecture and are sourced from all over the world.

Some of the films screened at previous festivals include: [[The Fountainhead (film)|The Fountainhead]], [[Metropolis (1927 film)|Metropolis]], [[City of God (2002 film)|City of God]], [[The Belly of an Architect]], [[The 11th Hour (2007 film)|The 11th Hour]], [[My Architect]], [[The Garden (2008 film)|The Garden]], and [[Marina of the Zabbaleen]]. Many of the films are award-winning and inspire the many people who attend the festival.

==Collaborative origin==

In 2006 the AAC formulated a plan for the creation of a registered integral collective which would be representative and controlled by the Architectural Profession in South Africa and charged with the organisational and administrative functions required to host a premier national event.

A formal non-profit organisation was registered in 2007 under the name of '''Architects Collective of South Africa''' (Reg.No. 2007/007763/08).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://architects.org.za/more-about-the-collective |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-04-08 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110322072337/http://architects.org.za/more-about-the-collective |archivedate=2011-03-22 |df= }} Retrieved on 8 April 2011&lt;/ref&gt; The first Festival with associated exhibitions was held in September 2007 in Johannesburg, Cape Town and Durban.

From the outset the Festival received the committed support of the [[South African Council for the Architectural Profession]], the South African Institute of Architects and a number of architectural practices and organisations. This has ensured its success and growth. The Architect Africa Film Festival is held over three weeks in  Johannesburg, Durban, Cape Town, Bloemfontein and Port Elizabeth, usually between the months of September and October.

==History==

The first Architect Africa Film Festival (2007) was held, and acclaimed, in South Africa’s three major centres in August and September 2007.&lt;ref&gt;Eicker, Karen (2007) 'Exploration through Art' in ''Archi-technology'', December 2007, pp.4-9.&lt;/ref&gt; The success of the first Festival, and the generous support of sponsors, enabled the Festival 2008 to take place in five cities – Johannesburg, Durban, Cape Town, Bloemfontein and Port Elizabeth – making it a truly national event.&lt;ref&gt;Unknown author (2008) 'Architect AFrica Film Festival' in ''Classic Feel'', September 2008, pp.84-85.&lt;/ref&gt;

In September 2009, the Architects’ Collective was invited to host Architect Africa Film Screenings at the Architecture Student Congress/African Perspectives Conference at the University of Pretoria.&lt;ref&gt;[http://aaff.co.za/node/126 Architect Africa Film Festival] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110811014342/http://aaff.co.za/node/126 |date=August 11, 2011 }} Retrieved on 8 April 2011&lt;/ref&gt; The event was used to launch the winning films from the Moving Spaces Student Film Competition.

As a result of this collaboration, the Collective was approached to host smaller events on behalf of the regional institutes of architecture. In October 2009, Architect Africa Film Screenings were held at the 50th Anniversary Celebration of the John Moffat building, School of Architecture &amp; Planning, at the University of the Witwatersrand.&lt;ref&gt;[http://aaff.co.za/node/126 Architect Africa Film Festival] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110811014342/http://aaff.co.za/node/126 |date=August 11, 2011 }} Retrieved on 8 April 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

2010 saw the Architects' Collective host their third and biggest film festival yet. Screenings were hosted again in the five major cities and included the first major public screenings of the Moving Space student films from 2009 and 2010.&lt;ref&gt;Unknown author (2010) 'Lights, Camera, Architecture!' in ''Architect &amp; Builder'', July/August 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; Alongside the film screenings the best photographs from the Tripod Photography competition were exhibited.

In addition, during the Johannesburg leg the Architects' Collective hosted a special screening at the Bus Factory as part of the AZA2010 festival.&lt;ref&gt;Unknown author (2010) 'Lights, Camera, Architecture!' in ''Architect &amp; Builder'', July/August 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; The Architects’ Collective continues to grow its recognition as a major player in the architecture and film festival communities.

[[File:ArtBattleNC2012.jpg|thumb|Yared Nigussu shows his winning painting after an Art Battle]]
'''Art Battles''' are live competitive painting events that take place in cities across Canada.  Currently there are events in
Vancouver, Toronto, Ottawa, Montreal, Kamloops, and Halifax.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.chatelaine.com/living/home-decorating/culture-fix-exciting-monthly-painting-competition/ |title=Culture fix: Exciting monthly painting competition |work=[[Chatelaine (magazine)|Chatelaine]] |publisher=Rogers Communications. |date=2012-09-17 |accessdate=2012-12-15 |first=Alex |last=Laws}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Chris Pemberton and Simon Plashkes started Art Battle in Toronto in October 2009.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Grainger |first=Lia |url=http://metronews.ca/voices/urban-compass-toronto/10981/theres-no-easel-way-out-in-art-battle/ |title=There's no easel way out in art battle |work=[[Metro News]] |publisher=Free Daily News Group Inc. |date=March 26, 2012 |accessdate=2012-12-15 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120622195443/http://metronews.ca/voices/urban-compass-toronto/10981/theres-no-easel-way-out-in-art-battle/ |archivedate=June 22, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Since then there has been an event at The Great Hall on [[Queen Street West]] every month.

Several artists are given 20 minutes to create a painting.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.thestar.com/living/article/873561--brush-with-greatness&lt;/ref&gt; Each audience member gets to vote on the painting they like the most by placing a ballot for that round (given at the door) in that artist's collection box.  There are 2 or 3 preliminary rounds in which the most popular artists move on to the final round.  The artist who gets the most ballots in the final round is declared the winner.  All the paintings are then auctioned off to the audience members.  Any painting that doesn't reach its minimum bid is destroyed with a chainsaw.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://nationalpost.com/arts/story.html?id=3038846 |title=Art Battle brings a paint brawl to the walls of Queen West in Toronto |last=Grainger |first=Lia |publisher=Postmedia Network Inc |work=[[National Post]] |date=2010-05-17 |accessdate=2012-12-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Battle of Lize''' (笠泽之战) was fought between the states of [[Wu (state)|Wu]] and [[Yue (state)|Yue]] in the [[Warring States period]] of [[Chinese history]]. In 478 BC, Yue attacked Wu and defeated Wu's army.

After this battle, Wu lost much of its power while Yue gained much territory, reversing the strength of the two states.

A '''big year''' is a personal challenge or an informal competition among [[Birdwatching|birders]] who attempt to identify as many species as possible by sight or sound, within a single calendar year and within a specific geographic area. Popularized in North America, big years are commonly done within single US states and Canadian provinces, as well as within larger areas such as the entire world, the lower 48 continental U.S. states, or within the official [[American Birding Association]] Area. The ABA big year record of 836 species was set by John Weigel of Australia in 2016.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://blog.aba.org/2017/12/2016-big-year-competition.html|title=2016 Big Year Competition Final Determination|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The world big year record of 6,833 species was set in 2016 by Arjan Dwarshuis of the Netherlands.&lt;ref&gt;http://world.observation.org/arjan.php&lt;/ref&gt;

==History of North American big years==

The wide publication in 1934 of the first modern field guide by [[Roger Tory Peterson]] truly revolutionized birding. However, in that era, most birders did not travel widely. The earliest known continent wide Big Year record was compiled by Guy Emerson, a traveling businessman, who timed his business trips to coincide with the best birding seasons for different areas in North America. During his best year, in 1939, he saw 497 species.&lt;ref&gt;Bird-Lore Jan/Feb 1940&lt;/ref&gt; In 1952, Emerson's record was broken by Bob Smart, who saw 515 species.&lt;ref&gt;Audubon Jan/Feb 1966: "Can I Count This Bird?"&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1953, [[Roger Tory Peterson]] and [[James Fisher (naturalist)|James Fisher]] took a 30,000 mile road trip visiting the wild places of [[North America]]. In 1955, they told the story of their travels in a book and a documentary film, both called ''Wild America''. In a footnote to the book, Peterson claimed "My year's list at the end of 1953 was 572 species." In 1956, a 25-year-old [[England|Englishman]] named [[Stuart Keith]], following Peterson and Fisher's route, compiled a list of 594 species, a record that stood for fifteen years.&lt;ref&gt;Audubon Sep/Oct 1961: "A Britisher Sets a New North American Record"&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1971, 18-year-old [[Ted Parker]], in his last semester of high school in southeastern [[Pennsylvania]], extensively birded the eastern seaboard of North America. That September, Parker enrolled in the [[University of Arizona]] in [[Tucson, Arizona|Tucson]] and found dozens of Southwestern U.S. and Pacific coast specialties, ending the year with a list of 626 species.

The 1969 foundation of the [[American Birding Association]] standardized and regulated North American Big Years. The ABA Area was defined as the 49 continental U.S. states (excluding Hawaii), [[Canada]], and the French islands of [[St. Pierre and Miquelon]], plus adjacent waters to a distance of 200 miles from land or half the distance to a neighboring country, whichever distance is less.

Big year efforts were still few and far between. In 1973 &lt;!--Parker's--&gt; [[Kenn Kaufman]] and Floyd Murdoch both pursued Parker's record. As recounted in Kaufman's book ''Kingbird Highway'', both broke the old record by a wide margin. Murdoch finished with 669 in the newly described ABA area to Kaufman's 666. Murdoch's record was broken in 1979 by James M. Vardaman, who saw 699 species that year and travelled 161,332 miles. Benton Basham, in 1983, topped Vardaman's effort with 710 species. 1987 marked the second time that there was a competition during a single year, with Sandy Komito's 722 species topping Steve Perry's 711. In 1992 Bill Rydell made a serious attempt at the record and ended with 714 species for the year.

In 1998, three birders, Sandy Komito, Al Levantin, and Greg Miller, chased Komito's prior record of 722 birds. In the end Komito kept the record, listing 745 species&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.surfbirds.com/Features/Attu.html |title=Attu Island |accessdate=12 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; birds plus 3 submitted in 1998 and later accepted by state committees for a revised total of 748.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nabirding.com/2011/11/08/interview-with-sandy-komito-745-or-748/ |title=Interview with Sandy Komito: 745 or 748? |accessdate=12 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mark Obmascik's book about the 1998 big year birders was adapted into the 2011 [[20th Century Fox]] film ''[[The Big Year]]''.

In 2008, Lynn Barber, the Texas big year record holder, became the first woman to break the 700-species barrier with a total of 723.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Barber|first=Lynn|title=Extreme Birder: One Woman's Big Year|year=2011|publisher=Texas A&amp;M University Press|isbn=978-1-60344-261-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2010, North Carolina birder Chris Hitt became the first birder to see 700+ species in the lower 48 in a single year, finishing with 704.&lt;ref&gt;[http://slowbirding.blogspot.com/ Slow Birding: the big year meets the big night]&lt;/ref&gt; In the same year, Virginia birder Robert Ake ended the year with 731 species, an extraordinary total achieved without the benefit of the relatively unique weather effects of 1998.&lt;ref&gt;[http://bobsbirds.blogspot.com/ Bob's Birds and Things]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2011, Colorado birder John Vanderpoel became the fastest birder on record to reach 700 species in a year. However, ultimately John only managed 743 birds, missing out on the record by two (or five, with Komito's revised total).&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theatlantic.com/life/archive/2011/10/the-big-year-one-mans-attempt-to-break-a-world-record-in-birding/247214/ Atlantic Monthly October, 2011]&lt;/ref&gt; Vanderpoel's effort was the last made without the major contribution of [[eBird]] and birding groups on [[Facebook]], which significantly enhanced the quality and quantity of rare bird alerts. 

In 2013, Massachusetts birder Neil Hayward reluctantly decided to do an ABA big year. Neil reached 700 species two weeks ahead of John Vanderpoel's 2011 pace, and ended his year on 747 species plus 3 provisionals.&lt;ref&gt;http://blog.aba.org/2013/12/congratulations-neil.html ABA Blog, December 31, 2013&lt;/ref&gt; Two provisionals later accepted by the ABA gave Hayward a final total of 749, which set a new ABA Big Year record.

In 2016, an unprecedented four birders attempted simultaneous ABA Area big years. A South Dakotan doctor birding as "[http://olafsbigyear.blogspot.com/ Olaf Danielson"] launched his "Bad Weather Big Year", reaching 700 species in May.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://olafsbigyear.blogspot.com/|title=The Bad Weather Big Year|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; John Weigel, an Australian conservationist and [[Tasmanian devil]] activist, also launched his big year, called "Birding for Devils."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.birdingfordevils.com/p/what-devil-about-this-blog.html|title=About this blog|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; While not seeking to break the record, American birding activist and blogger Christian Hagenlocher's "The Birding Project" aimed to attract more people to birding through a more social perspective.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thebirdingproject.com/|title=Home|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hagenlocher, at age 27, also became the youngest person to break the 700-species barrier for an ABA big year. Photographer Laura Keene, conducting a 2016 photographic big year, broke Lynn Barber's Big Year record for women in September.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://akeenebigyear.blogspot.com/|title=Team Snowcock|first=Laura|last=Keene|date=15 August 2016|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; 2016 marked the first time four birders had each seen over 700 species in the ABA Area in a year. On 16 July 2016, Weigel saw his 750th species, a [[Buller's shearwater]], breaking Hayward's previous record.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.birdingfordevils.com|title=Birding For Devils|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; All four birders would eventually surpass Hayward's total.

In October 2016, the ABA voted to add the U.S. state of [[Hawaii]] to the countable area for ABA Big Years. All the 2016 big year birders except Hagenlocher birded Hawaii during November and December 2016, even though the "New" ABA checklist was not updated until November 2017. [http://olafsbigyear.blogspot.com/ Olaf Danielson], partly due to efforts to promote bird conservation in Hawaii, incorporated Hawaii into his Big Year planning, keeping a list for the "New ABA" along with his Continental ABA list. John Weigel and Laura Keene subsequently birded Hawaii, with Weigel ending up with the highest total for the "New ABA" region (836), the Continental ABA region (784) and the United States (832). Danielson was close behind with 829 for the "New ABA," while setting a new record for the Lower 48 States (723). Weigel was nipping at his heels with 721. Keene shattered the previous record for photographed species with diagnostic photos of 792 species, and audio recordings of 10 others, out of her 815 total for the year. &lt;ref&gt;Neise, Greg. "Birding Magazine, Aug 2018 - The Next Big Thing"&lt;/ref&gt; 

2017 broke new ground, with five birders surpassing 700 species in the Continental ABA Area by September, and three breaking the 750-species barrier. Keene's women's record for the "New ABA" region was broken in 2017 by Yve Morrell.&lt;ref&gt;Lill, Joe (personal communication with all the 700+ birders)&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2018, Nicole Koeltzow reached the 700-species milestone on July 1st, while in August Gaylee and Richard Dean became the first birders to reach 700 species in consecutive years. On October 30, 2018, in Hawaii, Koeltzow became the 7th birder to reach the 800-species mark.&lt;ref&gt;https://ebird.org/top100?locInfo.regionCode=aba&amp;year=2018&amp;rankedBy=spp&lt;/ref&gt;

==World big years==

In 2008, British couple Alan Davies and Ruth Miller traveled around the world, seeing 4341 species. In 2015, Oregon birder [[Noah Strycker]] launched a worldwide big year with the goal of seeing at least 5,000 species—roughly half of the world's species—as he traveled around the globe. On September 16, in India, he broke the existing record of 4,341 species, set in 2008 by Alan Davies and Ruth Miller, when he saw a Sri Lanka frogmouth for his 4,342nd species of the year. He finished the year with 6,042 bird species, his last species seen being an Oriental Bay Owl in Assam, India.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.audubon.org/features/birding-without-borders|title=Birding Without Borders|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Strycker's record faced an immediate challenge in 2016 when Dutch birder Arjan Dwarshuis launched an effort to break it as well as raise money for the Birdlife Preventing Extinctions Programme.&lt;ref&gt;http://world.observation.org/arjan.php&lt;/ref&gt; On November 4, 2016, Dwarshuis saw a [[tody motmot]] in [[Panama]], breaking Strycker's previous record total. He finished the year with 6833 seen bird species and this is the new World big year record.

Because Dwarshuis primarily used the IOC Checklist and Strycker the Clements Checklist, their totals are not fully compatible, as the IOC checklist lists a greater number of species. However, Dwarshuis and Strycker have both compiled checklists for each list.

Many world big year birders aim to minimize costs through a sponsorship, and their carbon footprint through a [[carbon offset]] program.

==Alternative big years==

Traditional big year birders have drawn criticism from [[environmentalists]] for failing to consider the ecological impact of their travel. Several birders have attempted "green", or alternative big years to raise awareness for both birding and the environment. 
 
In 2005, two British cycling birders decided to have a competition. Chris Mills in Norfolk, England and Simon Woolley, Hampshire, England competed over who would see the most birds by cycling only and hence become the UK Green Year list record holder. Chris Mills won setting a record of 251 bird species.

Starting in the summer of 2007, teenager Malkolm Boothroyd and his parents, Ken Madsen and Wendy Boothroyd, attempted a big year without the use of fossil fuels by planning to bicycle over 10,000 miles to get over 400 species for the year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Stewart|first=Ian|title=A big green year for the birds|url=http://www.yukon-news.com/sports/7295/|publisher=Yukon News|accessdate=8 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;  They started in their home province of the Yukon Territory, rode down the Pacific Coast, looping back around Arkansas to catch the Texas spring migration, then eastward to Florida. They dubbed this attempt a "bird year," rather than a big year. In the end, they covered more than 13,000 miles by bicycle and tallied 548 species, raising more than $25,000 for bird conservation in the process.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.adventurecycling.org/default/assets/resources/200809_Waypoints_McCoy.pdf|title=Boy Wonder Bikes and Birds|last=McCoy|first=Michael|date=September–October 2008|work=Adventure Cyclist|accessdate=2018-01-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

2014 saw the first continent-wide "green year", a big year executed with a minimum of environmental impact. In his rather extreme instance, Dorian Anderson bicycled 17,830 miles around the United States, amassing a self-powered, petroleum-free 618 species during his 365 days on America's roads.  Dorian visited 28 states (some twice) during his adventure and, beyond his species total, raised $49,000 for habitat conservation. He shunned all motorized transportation for the entire adventure, refusing even ferries that would have saved him sometimes hundreds of miles of riding around various bodies of water. Once hit by a car and many times nearly missed, it was a minor miracle that he survived the entire year without major injury.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://bikingforbirds.blogspot.com|title=Biking for Birds|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Boardwalk Empire'' is a period drama focusing on Enoch "Nucky" Thompson (based on the historical [[Enoch L. Johnson]]),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://tv.nytimes.com/2010/09/17/arts/television/17boardwalk.html |title=Boardwalk Empire |work=The New York Times |first=Alessandra |last=Stanley |date=September 16, 2010 |accessdate=September 2, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; a political figure who rises to prominence and controls [[Atlantic City, New Jersey]], during the [[Prohibition]] period of the 1920s and 1930s. Nucky interacts with historical characters in both his personal and political life, including mobsters, politicians, government agents, and the common folk who look up to him. The federal government also takes an interest in the [[Rum-running|bootlegging]] and other illegal activities in the area, sending agents to investigate possible mob connections but also looking at Nucky's lifestyle—expensive and lavish for a county political figure. The final season jumps ahead seven years, to 1931, as Prohibition nears its end.

=== Development ===
[[Emmy Award]]-winner [[Terence Winter]], who served as executive producer and writer on the HBO series ''[[The Sopranos]]'', was hired on June 4, 2008 to adapt the non-fiction book ''Boardwalk Empire: The Birth, High Times, and Corruption of Atlantic City''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.movieweb.com/news/terence-winter-set-to-write-martin-scorceses-boardwalk-empire|title=Terence Winter Set to Write Martin Scorsese's Boardwalk Empire|work=MovieWeb|date=June 4, 2008|accessdate=August 10, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Winter had already been interested in creating a series set in the 1920s, feeling that it had never properly been explored before. For this reason he decided to focus his adaptation of the book on the section about Prohibition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ign.com/articles/2010/08/07/scorsese-introduces-boardwalk-empirel|title=Scorsese Introduces Boardwalk Empire|work=IGN|last=Goldman|first=Eric|date=August 7, 2010|accessdate=August 10, 2010|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://archive.is/20131013140512/http://ign.com/articles/2010/08/07/scorsese-introduces-boardwalk-empirel|archivedate=October 13, 2013|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; On September 1, 2009, it was announced that [[Academy Award]]-winning director [[Martin Scorsese]] would direct the pilot.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.backstage.com/news/scorsese-to-direct-pilot-for-hbos-boardwalk-empire/|title=Scorsese to Direct Pilot for HBO's 'Boardwalk Empire'|work=Back Stage|last=Andreeva|first=Nellie|date=September 1, 2009|accessdate=August 10, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; It would be the first time he had directed an episode of television since an episode of [[Steven Spielberg]]'s ''[[Amazing Stories (TV series)|Amazing Stories]]'' in 1986.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aintitcool.com/node/37847|title=Scorsese May Direct First TV Show Since AMAZING STORIES!!!|work=Ain't It Cool News|author=Hercules|date=August 7, 2008|accessdate=August 10, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The production would be very ambitious, with some even speculating it would be too large scale for television. "I kept thinking, 'This is pointless. How can we possibly afford a [[boardwalk]], or an empire?{{Single double}} says creator Terence Winter. "We can't call it 'Boardwalk Empire' and not see a boardwalk."&lt;ref name="variety"/&gt; The production would eventually build a {{convert|300|ft|m|adj=mid|-long}} boardwalk in an empty lot in Brooklyn, New York, at the cost of $5 million.&lt;ref name="nationalledger"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nationalledger.com/pop-culture-news/boardwalk-empire-pilot-18-mi-192559.shtml#.UlqhvSSVshQ|title=Boardwalk Empire Pilot, $18 Million 'Bigs Buck Bet' for HBO|work=The National Ledger|last=Johnson|first=Lynda|date=August 8, 2010|accessdate=August 10, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite a reported budget of up to $50 million,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.blackbookmag.com/nightlife/boardwalk-empire-1.20299|title=HBO's 'Boardwalk Empire' Cost $50 Million: How They Gonna Make It Back?|work=Black Book|last=Barna|first=Ben|date=January 15, 2010|accessdate=August 10, 2010|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111118170445/http://www.blackbookmag.com/nightlife/boardwalk-empire-1.20299|archivedate=November 18, 2011|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; the pilot's final budget came in at $18 million.&lt;ref name="variety"/&gt;

On why he chose to return to television, Scorsese said "What's happening the past nine to 10 years, particularly at HBO, is what we had hoped for in the mid-'60s with films being made for television at first. We'd hoped there would be this kind of freedom and also the ability to create another world and create long-form characters and story. That didn't happen in the 1970s, 1980s and in the 1990s I think. And of course...HBO is a trailblazer in this. I've been tempted over the years to be involved with them because of the nature of long-form and their development of character and plot."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.deadline.com/2010/08/tca-why-marty-scorsese-decided-to-do-tv/|title=TCA: Why Marty Scorsese Is Now Doing TV|work=Deadline Hollywood|last=Finke|first=Nikki|date=August 7, 2010|accessdate=August 10, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; He went on to praise HBO by saying, "A number of the episodes, in so many of their series, they're thoughtful, intelligent [and] brilliantly put together...It's a new opportunity for storytelling. It's very different from television of the past."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/ustv/s156/boardwalk-empire/news/a258472/martin-scorsese-praises-hbo.html|title=Martin Scorsese praises HBO|work=Digital Spy|last=Jeffery|first=Morgan|date=August 9, 2010|accessdate=August 10, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Casting ===
"Scorsese is an actor magnet," commented Winter. "Everybody wants to work with him. I had all these pictures on my wall and I thought, 'I'd really better write some good stuff for these people.{{Single double}}&lt;ref name="variety"/&gt; In casting the role of Nucky Thompson (based upon real-life Atlantic City political boss [[Enoch L. Johnson]]), Winter wanted to stray from the real life Johnson as much as possible. "If we were going to cast accurately what the real Nucky looked like, we'd have cast [[James Gandolfini|Jim Gandolfini]]."&lt;ref name="variety"/&gt; The idea of casting [[Steve Buscemi]] in the lead role came about when Scorsese mentioned wanting to work with the actor, whom Winter knew well having worked with him on ''The Sopranos''. Winter sent the script out to Buscemi, who responded very enthusiastically. "I just thought, 'Wow. I'm almost sorry I've read this, because if I don't get it, I'm going to be so sad.' My response was 'Terry, I know you're looking at other actors'...&amp;nbsp;and he said, 'No, no, Steve, I said we want you.{{Single double}}&lt;ref name="sepinwall"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hitfix.com/blogs/whats-alan-watching/posts/press-tour-hbo-s-boardwalk-empire-brings-martin-scorsese-to-television|title=Press Tour: HBO's Boardwalk Empire brings Martin Scorsese to television|work=Hit Fix|last=Sepinwall|first=Alan|date=August 7, 2010|accessdate=August 10, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Explained Scorsese, "I love the range he has, his dramatic sense, but also his sense of humor."&lt;ref name="sepinwall"/&gt;

The casting of Buscemi was soon followed by [[Michael Pitt]], best known for his roles in films such as ''[[Murder by Numbers]]'', ''[[The Dreamers (film)|The Dreamers]]'', and in the television series ''[[Dawson's Creek]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tvguide.com/News/Boardwalk-Empire-Casting-1001234.aspx?rss=breakingnews&amp;partnerid=imdb&amp;profileid=01|title=Pilot News: Michael Pitt Walks ''Boardwalk'' for HBO and Scorsese|work=TV Guide|last=Mitovich|first=Matt|date=January 2, 2009|accessdate=August 10, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was soon joined by [[Kelly Macdonald]], [[Vincent Piazza]] and [[Michael Shannon]], who had just received an [[Academy Award|Oscar nomination]] for his role in the [[Sam Mendes]] film ''[[Revolutionary Road (film)|Revolutionary Road]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hitfix.com/articles/2009-1-29-new-oscar-nominee-joins-scorsese-s-hbo-pilot/|title=New Oscar nominee joins Scorsese's HBO pilot|work=Hit Fix|author=Hit Fix Staff|date=January 29, 2009|accessdate=August 10, 2010|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100116090926/http://www.hitfix.com/articles/2009-1-29-new-oscar-nominee-joins-scorsese-s-hbo-pilot|archivedate=January 16, 2010|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Filming ===
Filming for the pilot took place at various locations in and around New York City in June 2009.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.broadcastingcable.com/article/278538-HBO_Not_Hung_Up_on_Decision_Making.php|title=HBO Not 'Hung' Up on Decision Making|work=Broadcasting &amp; Cable|last=Guthrie|first=Marisa|date=June 8, 2009|accessdate=August 11, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news | last = McGrath | first = Charles | title = On the Boardwalk, HBO Hangs Out With a New Mob | newspaper = The New York Times | date = September 3, 2010 | url = https://www.nytimes.com/2010/09/05/arts/television/05empire.html | accessdate =June 25, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; In creating the visual effects for the series, the company turned to Brooklyn-based effects company Brainstorm Digital.

===Costume design===
Designed by John Dunn and tailored by [[Martin Greenfield]], ''Boardwalk Empire's'' costumes were based on 1920s tailoring books from the [[Fashion Institute of Technology's]] research libraries and examples found at the [[Brooklyn Museum]] and [[Metropolitan Opera|the Met]]. The costumes have also been rented from the Daybreak Vintage Company located in Albany, NY which also exhibits at the Manhattan Vintage Clothing Show. Dunn's designs were meticulously detailed, including a [[collar pin]] for Nucky's shirts and even going so far as to incorporate specially ordered [[woolens]] for suiting. Dunn told ''[[Esquire (magazine)|Esquire]]'' magazine in a September 2010 interview, "With Marty and Terry Winters, I developed the feel for each of the characters. We all wanted it to be very, very accurate and specific to the period.... I don't like to do boring clothing, but you also have to make sure that you're not suddenly putting somebody in something that isn't going to make sense four episodes from now."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Peskowitz|first=Josh|url=http://www.esquire.com/blogs/mens-fashion/boardwalk-empire-costume-designer-091510 |title=The Bespoke Gangster Style of HBO's 'Boardwalk Empire' |publisher=Esquire |date=September 15, 2010 |accessdate=October 21, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;
These tailors were supplied by textile importer HMS fabrics and Gladson ltd.

===Martin Scorsese's contribution===
[[File:Martin Scorsese (2006 Peabody Awards).jpg|alt=Scorsese smiling|thumb|[[Martin Scorsese]] (pictured in 2006) directed the pilot.]]
[[Martin Scorsese]] was involved in the filming even before creator Terence Winter. He directed the [[television pilot|pilot]] and established the look of the show, which other directors later emulated for consistency. He is also one of the [[executive producer]]s of the show. Winter has stated that Scorsese weighed in on the casting decisions and reviewed all of the cuts and dailies. Up until the shooting of the show's first season, Scorsese and Winter would meet every Sunday afternoon to review what went on during the week where Scorsese would have comments and suggestions. Scorsese continued to be creatively involved in the ongoing production, but did not direct any more episodes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://collider.com/boardwalk-empire-interview-martin-scorsese-terrence-winter/ |last=Ryan |first=Maureen |title=Martin Scorsese and Terence Winter Interview |publisher=Collider.com |date=September 14, 2010 |accessdate=October 5, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Crew===
Scorsese and Winter were joined as executive producers by [[Mark Wahlberg]], Stephen Levinson and [[Tim Van Patten]]. Van Patten had been a regular director on ''The Sopranos'' and also served as a regular director for ''Boardwalk Empire''. [[Lawrence Konner]] was a co-executive producer. Konner also wrote for the show and had previously been a writer on ''The Sopranos''. [[Howard Korder]] and [[Margaret Nagle]] served as supervising producers and writers for the first season. The crew were recognized with multiple [[Primetime Emmy Award]] nominations for their work on the first season.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.emmys.com/shows/boardwalk-empire |title=Boardwalk Empire |publisher=Emmys.com |accessdate=February 11, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Korder returned as a co-executive producer and writer for the show's second season and as an executive producer in the third season.

===Soundtrack===
The music used for the opening titles is "Straight Up and Down" by [[The Brian Jonestown Massacre]]. It was chosen by series creator Winter to create a sense of the "unexpected."&lt;ref name="Brian"&gt;{{cite web|title='Boardwalk Empire' Theme: Series Creator Explains Decision to Use Contemporary Music|url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/boardwalk-empire-creator-explains-decision-239981|work=The Hollywood Reporter|accessdate=August 24, 2012|author1=Halperin, Shirley |author2=Ginsberg, Merle |date=September 25, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The soundtrack is composed of music from the 1890s to 1920s performed by artists such as [[Regina Spektor]], [[Leon Redbone]], [[Loudon Wainwright III]], [[Martha Wainwright]], [[Catherine Russell (singer)|Catherine Russell]], [[Nellie McKay]], [[Kathy Brier]], and [[Vince Giordano]] and the [[Nighthawks Orchestra]]. ''[[Boardwalk Empire Volume 1: Music from the HBO Original Series]]'', featuring music from seasons 1 and 2, was released on September 13, 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=Boardwalk Empire (Volume 1 Music From The Hbo Original Series) Soundtrack | url=http://www.cduniverse.com/productinfo.asp?pid=8597242 | publisher=CD Universe | accessdate=August 24, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The soundtrack won the [[Grammy Award for Best Compilation Soundtrack for Visual Media]] at the [[54th Grammy Awards]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=54th Annual GRAMMY Awards Nominees And Winners | url=http://www.grammy.com/nominees?genre=11 | work=Grammy.com | publisher=The Recording Academy | accessdate=August 24, 2012 | year=2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Advertising==
[[File:Boardwalk Empire - MTA advertisement.jpg|thumb|IRT LoV car 5443 advertising ''Boardwalk Empire'''s second season]]
To promote the second season, which started on September 25, 2011, the producers paid the [[Metropolitan Transportation Authority]] $150,000 to decorate and operate a [[New York Transit Museum]] train of four retired [[New York City Subway]] [[Lo-V (New York City Subway car)|Lo-V cars]] for each weekend in September 2011. The subway cars used were 5290, 5292 (both built in 1917), 5443, 5483 (both built in 1924). The train operated between noon and 6 p.m. and as an express between [[96th Street (IRT Broadway–Seventh Avenue Line)|96th Street]] and [[Times Square–42nd Street (New York City Subway)|Times Square–42nd Street Subway]] on the [[IRT Broadway–Seventh Avenue Line]]. While the MTA runs "nostalgia trains" each year, this was the first time they had been used for an advertising tie-in.&lt;ref name=fastcompany-advertising&gt;{{cite web| url = http://www.fastcompany.com/1777858/nycs-mta-takes-2-3-train-yesteryear-hbos-boardwalk-empire-campaign| title = NYC's MTA Takes The 2/3 Train To Yesteryear For HBO's "Boardwalk Empire" Campaign| author = Iezzi, Teressa| date = September 2, 2011| publisher = [[Fast Company (magazine)|Fast Company]]| accessdate =October 2, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

HBO also sponsored an [[Atlantic City]] beautification project with the tag line "Compliments of Nucky Thompson" and paid for eastbound tolls into Atlantic City on the [[AC Expressway]] for the weekend of September 24, 2011.&lt;ref name=fastcompany-advertising/&gt;

===Critical reception===
''Boardwalk Empire'' has received critical acclaim. For its first and second seasons, The [[American Film Institute]] named ''Boardwalk Empire'' one of the ten "best television programs of the year."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Seidman |first=Robert |url=http://tvbythenumbers.zap2it.com/2010/12/12/afi-awards-selections-announced-the-walking-dead-breaking-bad-glee-30-rock-and-boardwalk-empire-among-tv-winners/75177 |title=AFI Awards Selections Announced: ‘The Walking Dead,’ ‘Breaking Bad,’ ‘Glee,’ ’30 Rock’ and ‘Boardwalk Empire’ Among TV Winners |work=TV by the Numbers |date=December 12, 2010 |accessdate=February 8, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Gelman |first=Vlada |url=http://www.tvline.com/2011/12/afi-awards-2011-homeland-thrones-louie-justified/ |title=AFI's Top 10 of '11: Homeland, Game of Thrones, Justified and Louie Among First-Time Honorees |publisher=TVLine |date=December 11, 2011|accessdate=October 13, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The third season scored 76 of 100,&lt;ref name=MetacriticS3/&gt; and the fourth season scored 77 out of 100,&lt;ref name=MetacriticS4/&gt; both indicating "generally favorable reviews." In the show's fifth and final season, it scored 83 out of 100.&lt;ref name=MetacriticS5/&gt;

On another review aggregator site, [[Rotten Tomatoes]], the first season received a rating of 93%. Season two received an 88%, the third season an 87% and the fourth season a 97%, stating "''Boardwalk Empire'' continues to benefit from its meticulously realized period trappings, but what keeps the show watchable is its supremely talented ensemble players".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.rottentomatoes.com/tv/boardwalk-empire/s04/ |title=Boardwalk Empire: Season 4 (2013) |publisher=Rotten Tomatoes |accessdate=May 22, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The fifth season of the show holds a rating of 90%, with the site's consensus reading: "The final season of ''Boardwalk Empire'' is as visually dazzling and well-acted as ever, but it's the emphasis on Nucky Thompson's history that's particularly rewarding this time out."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.rottentomatoes.com/tv/boardwalk-empire/ |title=Boardwalk Empire: Season 5 (2014) |publisher=Rotten Tomatoes |accessdate=September 15, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

David Hinkley of the ''[[New York Daily News]]'' awarded the series five stars, saying, "Watching HBO's new 'Boardwalk Empire' is like sitting in your favorite tavern and hearing someone say, 'Drinks are on the house.' Friends, it does not get much better."&lt;ref name="nydn"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.nydailynews.com/entertainment/tv-movies/boardwalk-empire-impressively-recounts-roaring-20s-article-1.443885|title='Boardwalk Empire' impressively recounts roaring 20s|work=New York Daily News|last=Hinkley|first=David|date=September 17, 2010|accessdate=September 29, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Paige Wiser of the ''[[Chicago Sun-Times]]'' called it "...&amp;nbsp;an event not to be missed," and praised Buscemi in particular, calling his performance "fascinating."&lt;ref name="wiser"/&gt;

''[[TV Guide]]'''s Matt Roush praised the partnership of Scorsese and Winter, saying it "...&amp;nbsp;brilliantly marries Martin Scorsese's virtuosic cinematic eye to Terence Winter's panoramic mastery of rich character and eventful story," and finished his review by stating, "It's the most purely—and impurely—enjoyable storytelling HBO has delivered in ages, like a movie that you never want to end."&lt;ref name="tvguide"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tvguide.com/News/Roush-Review-Boardwalk-Empire-1023141.aspx|title=Roush Review: Dazzling ''Boardwalk'': I'll Drink to That!|work=TV Guide|last=Roush|first=Matt|date=September 16, 2010|accessdate=September 29, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Variety (magazine)|''Variety'']]'s Brian Lowry praised the show for returning network HBO to top form, saying, "This is, quite simply, television at its finest, occupying a sweet spot that—for all the able competition—still remains unique to HBO: An expensive, explicit, character-driven program, tackling material no broadcast network or movie studio would dare touch ... For those wondering when the channel would deliver another franchise to definitively put it on top of the world, Ma, the wait is over: Go directly to ''Boardwalk''."&lt;ref name="variety"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://variety.com/2010/tv/reviews/boardwalk-empire-1117943535/|title=Review: Boardwalk Empire|work=Variety|last=Lowry|first=Brian|date=September 12, 2010|accessdate=September 29, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

"One of the unexpected joys of ''Boardwalk Empire'', though, lies in the way the show revels in the oddities of its time, peeling back the layers of polite society to reveal a giddy shadow world of criminals and politicians collaborating to keep the liquor flowing," says online magazine ''[[Salon.com|Salon's]]'' Heather Havrilesky, who went on to call the pilot "breathtaking."&lt;ref name="salon"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.salon.com/2010/09/11/boardwalk_empire/|title="Boardwalk Empire": Gangsters return triumphantly to HBO|work=Salon.com|last=Havrilesky|first=Heather|date=September 11, 2010|accessdate=September 29, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Roberto Bianco from ''[[USA Today]]'' said in his review that ''Boardwalk Empire'' was "Extravagantly produced, shockingly violent and as cold and hard as ice, ''Boardwalk Empire'' brings us back to the world's former playground at the start of Prohibition—and brings HBO back to the forefront of the TV-series race."&lt;ref name="usatoday"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://usatoday30.usatoday.com/life/television/reviews/2010-09-17-boardwalk17_ST_N.htm|title=HBO builds a mighty, brutal 'Boardwalk Empire'|work=USA Today|last=Bianco|first=Robert|date=September 17, 2010|accessdate=September 29, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The second season received widespread acclaim. Verne Gay from ''Newsday'' stated that "''[[Mad Men]]'', of course, remains the King of the Emmys, while ''Empire'' nailed the equally prestigious Golden Globe for best drama last winter. But Sunday begins to build the case for ''Empire'', and build it convincingly."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.newsday.com/entertainment/tv/boardwalk-empire-returns-in-grand-style-1.3190110 |title='Boardwalk Empire' returns in grand style |work=Newsday | last=Gay|first=Verne |accessdate=September 22, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Matt Roush of ''[[TV Guide]]'' stated, "This is a gorgeous piece of storytelling that requires and rewards patience."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tvguide.com/News/Matts-Guide-Weekend-1037981.aspx |title=Matt's Guide to Weekend TV: New and Returning Shows |work=[[TV Guide]] | last=Roush|first=Matt |accessdate=September 23, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Brian Lowry stated in his review for [[Variety (magazine)|''Variety'']] that: "A few creative flourishes feel a trifle heavy-handed – starting with Shannon's philandering fed. Unlike Nucky, though, ''Boardwalk'' isn't campaigning for anything except the gratitude of a pay-cable audience (and award voters) eager to take refuge in its sordid charms. By that measure, the show doesn't just go down smoothly; it's good to the last illicit, intoxicating drop."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://variety.com/2011/tv/reviews/boardwalk-empire-2-1117946148/ |title=Review: 'Boardwalk Empire' |work=Variety | last=Lowry|first=Brian |accessdate=September 19, 2011 |date=September 19, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Nancy Franklin of ''[[The New Yorker]]'' considered Buscemi miscast as the central figure in the drama. "Buscemi can’t play that kind of character; even at the age of fifty-two, he looks cagey and restless—not like a guy at the top but like the guy who gets killed when he tries to knock off the guy at the top." The review concludes "''Boardwalk Empire''” is at great pains to give viewers a sense that they are there, and yet rarely did I feel engrossed in the show. Even if its point is to show you the ugly side of fun, ''Boardwalk Empire'' should be much more fun to watch."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Franklin|first1=Nancy|title=Jersey Boys|url=http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2010/09/20/jersey-boys|accessdate=September 11, 2016|work=The New Yorker|date=September 20, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Alessandra Stanley of ''[[The New York Times]]'' review states that "surprisingly, given the extraordinary talent and money behind it, ''Boardwalk Empire'' falls short. One possible reason is that the star, Steve Buscemi, is hard to accept in the lead role of Enoch Thompson," going on to observe "it takes a lot of squinting to see him as a powerbroker straddling two worlds."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Stanley|first1=Alessandra|title=Jersey Shore, the Early Years|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2010/09/17/arts/television/17boardwalk.html?_r=0|accessdate=September 11, 2016|work=The New York Times|date=September 16, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Brexit negotiations''' are taking place between the [[United Kingdom]] and the [[European Union]] for the [[Brexit|withdrawal of the United Kingdom from the European Union]] following the [[United Kingdom European Union membership referendum, 2016|United Kingdom European Union membership referendum]] in June 2016. The negotiating period began on 29 March 2017 when the United Kingdom [[United Kingdom invocation of Article 50 of the Treaty on European Union|served the withdrawal notice under Article 50]] of the [[Treaty on European Union]]. The period for negotiation stated in [[Withdrawal Agreement|Article 50]] is two years from notification, unless an extension is agreed.

On 19 June 2017, the British [[Secretary of State for Exiting the European Union|Brexit Secretary]], [[David Davis (British politician)|David Davis]], arrived in Brussels to begin the process with [[Michel Barnier]], the Chief Negotiator appointed by the European Commission.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/politics/blog/live/2017/jun/19/boris-johnson-and-gove-both-back-may-as-tory-leadership-speculation-continues-politics-live |title=UK appears to capitulate on sequencing on first day of Brexit talks – as it happened |first=Andrew |last=Sparrow |date=19 June 2017|newspaper=The Guardian |accessdate=23 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Negotiations on the [[United Kingdom European Union Withdrawal Agreement|withdrawal agreement]] (which includes a transitional period and an outline of the objectives for a future relationship between the UK and the EU) have now been concluded, with the European Union indicating that no further negotiation or changes before the UK legally leaves the EU on 29 March 2019 will be possible.

If the withdrawal agreement is ratified by the UK and other EU state governments and comes into force, future negotiation might also need to address Free Trade Agreement treaties between the European Union and its members (including the UK) for one part and third countries for the other part, and the [[tariff-rate quota]], which might be split or renegotiated.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.ceps.eu/publications/impact-brexit-eu%E2%80%99s-international-agreements |title=The Impact of Brexit on the EU's International Agreements |date=15 July 2016 |website=Centre for European Policy Studies |accessdate=3 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url=https://www.cigionline.org/publications/brexit-and-international-trade-one-year-after-referendum |title=Brexit and International Trade: One Year after the Referendum |first=Valerie |last=Hughes |date=26 September 2017 |journal=Centre for International Governance Innovation |accessdate=3 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
{{Brexit sidebar}}

===2015 United Kingdom General Election===
In the [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative Party]]'s manifesto for the [[United Kingdom general election, 2015|United Kingdom General Election in May 2015]], an EU referendum was promised by the end of 2017.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/election-2015-32302062|title=At-a-glance: Conservative manifesto|date=15 April 2015|accessdate=22 September 2018|website=Bbc.co.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2015/apr/14/conservatives-election-manifesto-2015-the-key-points|title=Conservatives election manifesto 2015 - the key points|first=Frances|last=Perraudin|date=14 April 2015|website=the Guardian|accessdate=22 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Preparatory work, and intentions==
According to the European parliament, "For the moment, it appears that the two sides have different views on the sequencing and scope of the negotiations, and notably the cross-over between the withdrawal agreement and the structure of future relations, and this divergence itself may be one of the first major challenges to overcome."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.europarl.europa.eu/RegData/etudes/IDAN/2017/599352/EPRS_IDA%282017%29599352_EN.pdf |title=UK withdrawal from the European Union |website=European Parliament |date=March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== UK negotiation ===
* [[Theresa May]], [[Prime Minister of the United Kingdom]]
* [[Oliver Robbins]], Europe advisor to the Prime Minister
* [[David Davis (British politician)|David Davis]] (until 9 July 2018), [[Secretary of State for Exiting the European Union]].
* [[Dominic Raab]] (from 9 July 2018 until 15 November 2018), [[Secretary of State for Exiting the European Union]].
* Sir [[Tim Barrow]], [[List of Permanent Representatives of the United Kingdom to the European Union|UK Permanent Representative to the EU]]

The [[Department for Exiting the European Union]] is responsible for overseeing the negotiations to leave the EU and for establishing the future relationship between the UK and EU.

The United Kingdom's proposed principles were set out in the Article 50 notification:
* Constructive discussions
* Citizens first
* Comprehensive agreement
* Minimise disruption
* Ireland/Northern Ireland position
* Technical talks on detailed policy
* Work together on European values&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url= https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2017/03/29/article-50-brexit-letter-read-full/ |title= Article 50 letter: Read it in full |newspaper=[[The Daily Telegraph]]|date=30 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Prime Minister's formal letter of notification was delivered in Brussels on 29 March 2017.&lt;ref name="notificationletter"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/604079/Prime_Ministers_letter_to_European_Council_President_Donald_Tusk.pdf |title=Prime Minister's letter to Donald Tusk triggering Article 50 |date=19 March 2017 |website=UK Government |access-date=1 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; It included withdrawal from the [[European Atomic Energy Community]]. The letter recognized that consequences for the UK of leaving the EU included loss of influence over the rules that affect the European economy, and UK companies trading within the EU aligning with rules agreed by institutions of which the UK would no longer be part. It proposed agreeing to seven principles for the conduct of the withdrawal negotiation. These are for:
# engaging with one another constructively and respectfully, in a spirit of sincere cooperation.
# aiming to strike an early agreement about the rights of the many EU citizens living in the United Kingdom, and UK citizens living elsewhere in the European Union.
# working towards securing a comprehensive agreement, taking in both economic and security cooperation, and agreeing the terms of our future partnership alongside those of our withdrawal from the EU.
# working together to minimise disruption and giving as much certainty as possible, letting people and businesses in the UK and the EU benefit from implementation periods to adjust in an orderly way to new arrangements.
# in particular, paying attention to the UK's unique relationship with the Republic of Ireland and the importance of the peace process in Northern Ireland.
# beginning technical talks on detailed policy areas as soon as possible, including a Free Trade Agreement covering sectors crucial to our linked economies such as financial services and network industries.
# continuing to work together to advance and protect our shared liberal, democratic values of Europe, to ensure that Europe remains able to lead in the world, projecting its values and defending itself from security threats.

==== Role of the countries of the United Kingdom ====
{{further|Countries of the United Kingdom}}
The constitutional lawyer and retired German Supreme Court judge [[Udo Di Fabio]] has stated his opinion that separate negotiations with the EU institutions by Scotland or Northern Ireland would constitute a violation of the Lisbon Treaty, according to which the integrity of a member country is explicitly put under protection.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.faz.net/aktuell/politik/brexit/zukunft-der-europaeischen-union-kopf-hoch-14327446.html |title=Future of the European Union – Chin up! |last=Di Fabio |first=Udo |date=7 July 2016|newspaper=[[Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung]] |accessdate=29 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== UK general election ====
The start of negotiations was delayed until after the [[United Kingdom general election, 2017|United Kingdom general election]], which took place on 8 June 2017.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-39643804 |title=General election 2017: MPs back plans for 8 June poll |website=BBC News |date=19 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Antonio Tajani]], speaking on 20 April said that the early election should bring stability to the UK, which would have been good for negotiations.&lt;ref name="Sky204"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://news.sky.com/story/general-election-is-good-for-brexit-negotiations-says-european-parliament-president-10844115 |title=General Election is good for Brexit negotiations, says European Parliament President |website=Sky News |date=20 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the event, the election led to a [[hung parliament]] which has reduced the Prime Minister's room for manoeuvre;  in particular in respect of the [[Irish border question]] due to her dependency on a [[confidence and supply]] agreement with Northern Ireland's [[Democratic Unionist Party]].

=== EU27 negotiation ===
{{see also|European Union negotiating directives for Brexit}}
* [[Michel Barnier]], Chief negotiator
* [[Guy Verhofstadt]], representative of the [[European Parliament]] in the negotiations
* [[Donald Tusk]], [[President of the European Council]]
* [[Antonio Tajani]], [[President of the European Parliament]]
* [[Jean-Claude Juncker]], [[President of the European Commission]]

Following the United Kingdom's notification under Article 50, draft guidelines for the negotiations were sent to EU delegations of the 27 other member states (the EU27). The draft, prepared by the [[President of the European Council]], states that the guidelines define the framework for negotiations under Article 50 and set out the overall positions and principles that the Union will pursue throughout the negotiation. It states that in the negotiations the Union's overall objective will be to preserve its interests, those of its Member States, its citizens and its businesses, and that, in the best interest of both sides, the Union will be constructive throughout and strive to find an agreement. The draft sets out two Core Principles:
# The European Council will continue to base itself on the principles set out in the statement of Heads of State or Government and of the Presidents of the European Council and the European Commission on 29 June 2016. It reiterates its wish to have the United Kingdom as a close partner in the future. It further reiterates that any agreement with the United Kingdom will have to be based on a balance of rights and obligations, and ensure a level-playing field. Preserving the integrity of the [[European Single Market]] excludes participation based on a sector-by-sector approach. A non-member of the Union, that does not live up to the same obligations as a member, cannot have the same rights and enjoy the same benefits as a member. In this context, the European Council welcomes the recognition by the British Government that the four freedoms of the Single Market are indivisible and that there can be no "cherry picking". "
# Negotiations under Article 50 TEU ([[Treaty on European Union]]) will be conducted as a single package. In accordance with the principle that nothing is agreed until everything is agreed, individual items cannot be settled separately. The Union will approach the negotiations with unified positions, and will engage with the United Kingdom exclusively through the channels set out in these guidelines and in the negotiating directives. So as not to undercut the position of the Union, there will be no separate negotiations between individual Member States and the United Kingdom on matters pertaining to the withdrawal of the United Kingdom from the Union."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |newspaper=The Daily Telegraph |title=In full: The EU's draft guidelines for Brexit negotiations |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2017/03/31/full-eus-draft-guidelines-brexit-negotiations/ |date=31 March 2017 |accessdate=8 April 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the European Parliament, the withdrawal agreement and any possible transitional arrangement(s) should enter into force "well before the elections to the European Parliament of May 2019", and the negotiations should focus on:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.europarl.europa.eu/resources/library/media/20170329RES69090/20170329RES69090.pdf |title=European Parliament resolution on negotiations with the United Kingdom following its notification that it intends to withdraw from the European Union |website=European Parliament |date=29 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* The legal status of European Union citizens living or having lived in the United Kingdom and of United Kingdom citizens living or having lived in other Member States, as well as other provisions concerning their rights;
* The settlement of financial obligations between the United Kingdom and the European Union;
* The European Union's external border;
* The clarification of the status of the United Kingdom's international commitments taken as a Member of the European Union, given that the European Union of 27 Member States will be the legal successor of the European Union of 28 Member States;
* Legal certainty for legal entities, including companies;
* The designation of the Court of Justice of the European Union as the competent authority for the interpretation and enforcement of the withdrawal agreement.

On 18 April 2017, a spokesman for [[Donald Tusk]] said "We expect to have the Brexit guidelines adopted by the European Council on 29 April and, following that, the Brexit negotiating directives ready on 22 May".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=http://news.sky.com/story/election-call-likened-to-hitchcock-film-by-eus-donald-tusk-10842357 |title=Election call likened to Hitchcock film by EU's Donald Tusk |last=Minelle |first=Bethany |date=18 April 2017 |website=Sky News |access-date=19 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 29 April the EU27 unanimously endorsed the draft guidelines with no debate.&lt;ref name="Sky294"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://news.sky.com/story/eu-leaders-unanimously-agree-brexit-strategy-10855627 |title=EU leaders unanimously agree Brexit strategy |website=Sky News |date=29 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a speech to a plenary session of the European Committee of the Regions in Brussels on 22 March 2017, Barnier, as EU Chief Negotiator for the Preparation and Conduct of the Negotiations, said that the EU wanted to succeed by reaching a deal with the British, not against them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://europa.eu/rapid/press-release_SPEECH-17-723_en.htm |title=Speech by Michel Barnier, Chief Negotiator for the Preparation and Conduct of the Negotiations with the United Kingdom, at the plenary session of the European Committee of the Regions |date=22 March 2017 |website=[[European Commission]] |access-date=30 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 22 May the European Commission Council, following the approval of [[European Union negotiating directives for Brexit|negotiating directives]] which had been adopted by strong qualified majority (72% of the 27 Member States, i.e. 20 Member States representing 65% of the population of the EU27), authorised the opening of Article 50 discussions with the Commission appointed as the negotiator. It further confirmed that all agendas, EU position papers, Non-papers and EU text proposals will be released to the public and published on line.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://europa.eu/rapid/press-release_IP-17-1405_en.htm |title=European Commission receives mandate to begin negotiations with the UK |website=European Commission |date=22 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Intergovernmental organization===

[[Intergovernmental organization]]s also involved in Brexit uncertainty considerations include the [[World Trade Organization]] (WTO) and the [[International Air Transport Association]] (IATA). IATA expects an agreement to avoid disruption.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine |url=http://www.air-cosmos.com/brexit-iata-veut-une-solution-rapide-104095 |title=Brexit : IATA veut une solution rapide |first=Jean-Baptiste |last=Heguy |date=5 December 2017 |magazine=[[Air &amp; Cosmos]] |language=fr |accessdate=9 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Phases ===
EU27 guidelines include:
* Agreement on the so-called "[[EU divorce bill|divorce bill]]";
* Agreement on rights of EU citizens living in the UK;
* Agreement on the border between Northern Ireland and the Republic
within the withdrawal phase.&lt;ref name="Sky294" /&gt;

The second phase, covering the post-Brexit relationship between the EU27 and the UK, will begin "as soon as the European Council decides that sufficient progress has been made in the first phase towards reaching a satisfactory agreement on the arrangements for an orderly withdrawal".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.consilium.europa.eu/en/press/press-releases/2017/04/29-euco-brexit-guidelines/ |title=European Council (Art. 50) guidelines for Brexit negotiations |date=29 April 2017 |website=European Council |access-date=9 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The earliest opportunity for this decision was 19 October 2017, at a summit of EU leaders.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2017-03-30/brexit-watchers-your-guide-to-key-dates-in-coming-negotiations |title=Your Guide to Key Dates in the Brexit Negotiations |last=Chrysoloras |first=Nikos |date=30 March 2017 |website=Bloomberg.com|access-date=9 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; although at that meeting it was agreed to start negotiations during the December meeting.&lt;ref name="auto2"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.consilium.europa.eu/media/23512/20-euco-conclusions-art50.pdf |title=Council Conclusions |date=20 October 2017 |website=European Council |access-date=8 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some effects of the UK withdrawal could emerge before the UK and the EU27 conclude the Article 50 negotiation, as a result of policies existing when the negotiation begins, or some change of policy later. At the outset policy provisions binding on the EU include principles, aspirations and objectives set out in the TEU ([[Treaty on European Union]]) Preamble&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Consolidated_version_of_the_Treaty_on_European_Union/Preamble |title=Consolidated version of the Treaty on European Union|at=Peramble|via=Wikisource}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Articles,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Consolidated_version_of_the_Treaty_on_European_Union/Title_I:_Common_Provisions |title=Consolidated version of the Treaty on European Union|at=Title I: Common Provisions|via=Wikisource}}&lt;/ref&gt; of which

:''Article 3'' mentions the promotion of "scientific and technological advance" in a context governed by "The Union's aim is to promote peace, its values and the well-being of its peoples", the Union's [[European Single Market|internal market]], "work for the [[sustainable development]] of Europe based on balanced economic growth and price stability, a highly competitive [[social market economy]], aiming at full employment and social progress", and the requirement that "The Union shall pursue its objectives by appropriate means commensurate with the competences which are conferred upon it in the Treaties",

and

:''Article 4'' mentions "competences not conferred upon the Union in the Treaties remain with the Member States".

Policies mentioned in the Preamble include:

– Achieve the strengthening and convergence of Member States' economies and establish an economic and monetary union including a single and stable currency,

– Promote economic and social progress for their peoples, taking into account the principle of sustainable development and within the context of the accomplishment of the internal market and of reinforced cohesion and environmental protection, and implement policies ensuring that advances in economic integration are accompanied by parallel progress in other fields,

– Establish a citizenship common to nationals of their countries,

– Implement a common foreign and security policy including the progressive framing of a common defence policy, thereby reinforcing the European identity and its independence in order to promote peace, security and progress in Europe and in the world,

– Facilitate the [[Freedom of movement for workers in the European Union|free movement of persons]], while ensuring the safety and security of their peoples, by establishing an area of freedom, security and justice.

– Continue the process of creating an ever-closer union among the peoples of Europe, in which decisions are taken as closely as possible to the citizen in accordance with the principle of subsidiarity.

UK policy was stated in a [[white paper]] published in February 2017: ''The United Kingdom's exit from and new partnership with the European Union''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/589191/The_United_Kingdoms_exit_from_and_partnership_with_the_EU_Web.pdf |title=The United Kingdom's exit from and new partnership with the European Union |date=February 2017 |website=UK Government}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the white paper, UK negotiating policy was set out as twelve guiding principles:
:''1.'' Providing certainty and clarity, including a "Great Repeal Bill" to remove the European Communities Act 1972 from the [[statute book]] and convert existing EU law into domestic law.
:''2.'' Taking control of the UK statute book and ending the jurisdiction of the [[Court of Justice of the European Union]] in the UK.
:''3.'' Strengthening the Union of all parts of the Kingdom, and remaining fully committed to the [[Good Friday Agreement|Belfast Agreement]] and its successors.
:''4.'' Working to deliver a practical solution that allows for the maintenance of the [[Common Travel Area]] whilst protecting the integrity of the UK immigration system, and which protects the strong ties with Ireland.
:''5.'' Controlling the number of EU nationals coming to the UK.
:''6.'' Securing the status of EU citizens who are already living in the UK, and that of UK nationals in other Member States.
:''7.'' Protecting and enhancing existing workers' rights.
:''8.'' Forging a new partnership with the EU, including a wide reaching free trade agreement, and seeking a mutually beneficial new customs agreement with the EU.
:''9.'' Forging free trade relationships across the world.
:''10.'' Remaining at the vanguard of science and innovation and seeking continued close collaboration with the UK's European partners.
:''11.'' Continuing to work with the EU to preserve European security, to fight terrorism, and to uphold justice across Europe.
:''12.'' Seeking a phased process of implementation, in which both the UK and the EU institutions and the remaining EU Member States prepare for the new arrangements.

=== Pre–negotiation meetings ===

A meeting at [[10 Downing Street]] took place on 6 April 2017 between [[Theresa May]] and [[Donald Tusk]] to discuss "the way ahead on Brexit".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://news.sky.com/story/pm-to-meet-donald-tusk-to-for-brexit-discussions-at-number-10-10827086 |title=PM to meet Donald Tusk for Brexit discussions at Number 10 |website=Sky News |date=6 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another meeting took place in London on 20 April 2017, this time between Theresa May and [[Antonio Tajani]] to discuss the rights of EU citizens.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.politico.eu/article/antonio-tajani-meet-theresa-may-in-london-parliament-president/ |title=Antonio Tajani to meet Theresa May in London |website=Politico.eu |date=13 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; After 20 April meeting, Antonio Tajani said that the UK and EU27 timetables fitted well together, with a two-year exit deal negotiation followed by a three-year transition phase.&lt;ref name=Sky204/&gt; A 10 Downing Street meeting between Theresa May, [[Michel Barnier]] and [[Jean-Claude Juncker]] took place on 26 April to discuss the withdrawal process. May reiterated the UK's aim for a "deep and special partnership" after Brexit.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-39722903 |title=Brexit: Theresa May meets EU's chief negotiator for talks |website=BBC News |date=27 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At a meeting on 29 April 2017 the EU27 unanimously endorsed the draft guidelines with no debate.&lt;ref name="Sky294"/&gt; A meeting took place between Michel Barnier and both houses of the Irish parliament on 11 May, where Barnier assured members of [[Dáil Éireann]] and [[Seanad Éireann]] that Europe would "work with you to avoid a hard border".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://news.sky.com/story/eu-chief-tells-ireland-he-will-work-to-avoid-hard-border-post-brexit-10872491 |title=Barnier tells Ireland he'll work to avoid hard border post-Brexit |website=Sky News |date=11 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Barnier went on to say that "the Irish border issue would be one of his three priorities in the negotiations," and that "there is always an answer".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-39889292 |title=Brexit Irish border answer can be found – EU's Barnier |date=12 May 2017 |website=BBC News |access-date=13 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The UK retains its full EU rights until Brexit, and the EU is seeking to increase their budget, leading to the possibility that Britain may veto EU budget increases, which in the immediate term amount to 4 billion euros. A continued British veto would have far-reaching consequences and "will hurt us" according to German MEP Jens Geier.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.spiegel.de/politik/ausland/angela-merkel-veraergert-ueber-jean-claude-juncker-nach-brexit-dinner-a-1146299.html |title= Treffen mit May: Merkel verärgert über Juncker nach Brexit-Dinner |trans-title=Meeting with May: Merkel annoyed with Juncker after Brexit dinner |newspaper=[[Der Spiegel]] |language=de |date=6 May 2017 |accessdate=15 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Negotiation phase 1: withdrawal arrangements ==

=== June 2017 ===
On 19 June 2017, David Davis arrived in Brussels to start negotiations with Michel Barnier.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-40321271 |title=Brexit negotiations: Barnier rules out 'concessions' |date=19 June 2017 |website=BBC News |accessdate=23 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Terms of reference were agreed, and dates were set for four-week cycles, to culminate in a fifth round of negotiations in the week commencing 9 October. Negotiating groups were established for three topics: the rights of EU citizens living in Britain and vice versa; Britain's outstanding financial obligations to the EU; and the border between Northern Ireland and the Irish Republic.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://ec.europa.eu/commission/sites/beta-political/files/eu-uk-art-50-terms-reference_agreed_amends_en.pdf |title=Terms of Reference for the Article 50 TEU negotiations |last= |first= |date=19 June 2017 |website=European Commission|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=29 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://researchbriefings.parliament.uk/ResearchBriefing/Summary/CBP-8017 |title=Brexit: the talks begin |date=12 July 2017 |website=House of Commons Library |accessdate=20 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Let the Brussels games begin |url=https://www.economist.com/britain/2017/06/22/let-the-brussels-games-begin |accessdate=22 September 2018 |publisher=Economist.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== July ===
Four days of talks, largely between officials, were held in Brussels on 17–20 July. Progress was made in understanding each other's positions.&lt;ref name="HoC-July"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://researchbriefings.parliament.uk/ResearchBriefing/Summary/CBP-8068 |title=Brexit: the July negotiations |date=2 August 2017 |website=House of Commons Library |accessdate=20 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On citizens' rights, a joint paper compared the positions of the two parties in tabular form.&lt;ref name="jointcomparison"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/joint-technical-note-on-the-comparison-of-eu-uk-positions-on-citizens-rights |title=Joint technical note on the comparison of EU-UK positions on citizens' rights |last= |first= |date=20 July 2017 |website=Department for Exiting the European Union|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url= |accessdate=30 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; On Irish border issues, both parties stated that they remained committed to the [[Good Friday Agreement]].&lt;ref name="HoC-July" /&gt; Michel Barnier called for clarification from the UK in the August round on the financial settlement, citizens' rights and Ireland, including on how the UK intends to maintain the [[Common Travel Area]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://europa.eu/rapid/press-release_SPEECH-17-2108_en.htm |title=Speaking points by Michel Barnier at the press conference following the second round of Article 50 negotiations with the United Kingdom |date=20 July 2017 |website=European Commission |accessdate=20 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== August ===
Talks were held in Brussels on 28–31 August. Agreement was reached on points including protecting the rights of frontier workers (those living in one country and working in another); recognition by the UK of social security contributions made both before and after exit; and continuation of healthcare reimbursement for UK citizens who are in the EU27 on exit day and vice versa.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://researchbriefings.parliament.uk/ResearchBriefing/Summary/CBP-8082 |title=Brexit: the August negotiations |date=6 September 2017 |website=House of Commons Library |accessdate=9 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The joint paper comparing the two parties' positions was updated.&lt;ref name="jointcomparison" /&gt;

Speaking at the conclusion of the talks, Michel Barnier highlighted two areas of disagreement: the role of the European Court of Justice in enforcing citizens' rights, and the extent of the UK's financial obligations. He stated "Time is passing quickly" and added that "at the current speed, we are far from being able to recommend to the European Council that there has been sufficient progress in order to start discussions on the future relationship".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://europa.eu/rapid/press-release_SPEECH-17-3043_en.htm |title=Speech by Michel Barnier at the press conference following the third round of Article 50 negotiations with the United Kingdom |last= |first= |date=31 August 2017 |website=European Commission|language=en|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=6 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===September===
On 7 September the EU Task Force published guiding principles for the dialogue on Ireland / Northern Ireland which reiterated and expanded the principles given in 29 April guidelines, in particular the protection of the Good Friday Agreement and the continuation of the Common Travel Area.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://europa.eu/rapid/press-release_IP-17-3105_en.htm |title=Brexit: European Commission publishes guiding principles on Ireland and Northern Ireland |last= |first= |date=7 September 2017 |website=European Commission|language=en|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=15 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The fourth round of talks began on 25 September, having been delayed by one week as Theresa May was due to deliver a speech in Florence on the 22nd.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2017-09-12/u-k-eu-are-said-to-delay-next-round-of-brexit-negotiations |title=U.K. and EU Delay Next Round of Brexit Negotiations |last= |first= |date=12 September 2017 |website=Bloomberg.com|access-date=26 September 2017|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=}}&lt;/ref&gt; She proposed a transitional "implementation period" of "around two years" and said that the UK "will honour commitments" so as to not make other EU countries pay more or receive less during the current EU budget period.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.ft.com/content/9b183886-9faf-11e7-8cd4-932067fbf946 |title=Five key points from Theresa May's speech |last1=Wright |first1=Robert |date=22 September 2017|newspaper=Financial Times |archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url= |accessdate=26 September 2017|url-access=subscription}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The programme for the round of talks arranged for meetings between the "Principals" and for three negotiating groups covering citizens' rights, financial settlement and other separation issues, while Northern Ireland issues would be addressed by the "Coordinators", and governance of the withdrawal agreement was also for discussion at technical level.&lt;ref name="European Union 2017"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.gov.uk/government/news/programme-for-fourth-round-of-uk-eu-article-50-negotiations |title=Programme for fourth round of UK-EU Article 50 negotiations |date=25 September 2017 |website=Department for Exiting the European Union |access-date=30 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

David Davis repeated Theresa May's request for a time-limited implementation period. The UK offered to incorporate the Withdrawal Agreement into UK law and ensure the UK courts can refer directly to it, but there was no agreement on the role of the European Court of Justice and the standing of future ECJ case law.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite news |url=http://www.express.co.uk/news/politics/859890/Brexit-news-EU-David-Davis-Michel-Barnier-progress-talks |title=Brexit breakthrough?

Mr Barnier welcomed the UK's commitment regarding payments into the current EU budget plan, but expressed reservations about obligations beyond 2020. Mr Davis said the UK was not yet in a position to quantify its commitments.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

There were constructive discussions on the Irish border, but no substantive progress.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://researchbriefings.parliament.uk/ResearchBriefing/Summary/CBP-8104 |title=Brexit: the September negotiations |date=6 October 2017 |website=House of Commons Library |accessdate=14 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The UK accepted the EU's definition of 'citizens lawfully resident before the cut off date', although that date was not agreed. There was agreement on the definitions of permanent and temporary residence. The UK offered a more generous "right of return" (after absence for longer than two consecutive years) than the minimum rights under current EU law. Rights of future family members remains a point of disagreement. The joint paper comparing the two parties' positions was again updated.&lt;ref name="jointcomparison" /&gt;

=== October ===
The fifth round of negotiations was held on 9, 10 and 12 October. There was technical progress on citizens' rights, although divergences remained on aspects of family reunion and the export from the UK of social security benefits.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://researchbriefings.parliament.uk/ResearchBriefing/Summary/CBP-8125 |title=Brexit: the October negotiations |last= |first= |date=27 October 2017 |website=House of Commons Library|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=30 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The UK stated an intention to offer a simple process for registration of EU citizens. On the Irish border, work continued to map out current areas of cooperation and build a picture of the future challenges.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-41585430 |title=Deadlock over UK's Brexit bill - Barnier |last= |first= |date=12 October 2017 |website=BBC News|access-date=14 October 2017|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On the financial settlement, Michel Barnier welcomed the commitment made by Theresa May in her Florence speech, but no negotiations took place because the UK was not ready to give details of what it would pay. Barnier said this issue had reached an impasse.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://europa.eu/rapid/press-release_STATEMENT-17-3921_en.htm |title=Press statement by Michel Barnier following the fifth round of Article 50 negotiations with the United Kingdom |last= |first= |date=12 October 2017 |website=European Commission|language=en|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=14 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This round of talks completed the timetable agreed in June,&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; with no further rounds scheduled.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/brexit-talks-negotiations-deadlock-article-50-theresa-may-eu-david-davis-a7999156.html |title=No further Brexit talks yet scheduled as negotiations hit deadlock |last=Stone |first=Jon |date=14 October 2017|newspaper=The Independent|access-date=15 October 2017|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2017-10-27/u-k-stalling-on-new-brexit-talks-as-clock-ticks-down-to-summit |title=The U.K. Is Stalling on New Brexit Talks |last1=Ross |first1=Tim |last2=Wishart |first2=Ian |date=27 October 2017 |website=Bloomberg |access-date=30 October 2017|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Further talks were held in Brussels on 9 and 10 November.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.gov.uk/government/news/programme-for-uk-eu-article-50-negotiations-9-10-november |title=Programme for UK-EU Article 50 negotiations, 9–10 November |last= |first= |date=9 November 2017 |website=UK Government |language=en|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=10 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Speaking at the closing press conference, Michel Barnier confirmed that clarification on financial commitments by the UK was required within the next two weeks.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2017/nov/10/uk-given-two-week-deadline-to-make-concessions-on-brexit-divorce-bill |title=EU gives UK two-week deadline on Brexit divorce bill |last1=Boffey |first1=Daniel |date=10 November 2017|newspaper=The Guardian|access-date=10 November 2017|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url= |last2=Rankin |first2=Jennifer|language=en-GB|issn=0261-3077}}&lt;/ref&gt; If the informal deadline is not met, the next phase of negotiations will not start in December, said Barnier.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Speech by Michel Barnier following the sixth round of Article 50 negotiations with the United Kingdom |url=http://europa.eu/rapid/press-release_SPEECH-17-4545_en.htm |website=European Commission |accessdate=11 November 2017 |date=10 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; EU diplomats have described the situation as a "[[chicken and egg]] dilemma", as the EU will only start working on transition guidelines if Britain makes progress on financial issues by the end of November 2017.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.ft.com/content/51b59608-c4a2-11e7-b2bb-322b2cb39656|url-access=subscription |title=EU gives UK up to 3 weeks to make Brexit bill offer |last=Barker |first=Alex |last2=Parker |first2=George |date=9 November 2017|newspaper=Financial Times|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=10 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; By 17 November, however, Donald Tusk said there was no deadlock in talks between Britain and the EU following a meeting with Theresa May in Gothenburg, Sweden and that he was optimistic that negotiations could move on to the next phase in December.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-britain-eu-tusk-may/eus-tusk-no-deadlock-on-brexit-very-cautious-but-optimistic-idUSKBN1DH20I |title=EU's Tusk: no deadlock on Brexit, very cautious but optimistic |date=17 November 2017 |website=Reuters |accessdate=9 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Discussions on the financial settlement took place later in the month, led by [[Oliver Robbins]] for the UK and [[Sabine Weyand]] for the EU.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2017/11/28/exclusive-britain-eu-agree-brexit-divorce-bill/ |title=Exclusive: Britain and the EU agree Brexit divorce bill |last=Foster |first=Peter |date=28 November 2017|newspaper=The Daily Telegraph|access-date=2 December 2017|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|language=en-GB|issn=0307-1235}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== December 2017 ===
Negotiations between officials led to a draft agreement which was expected to be finalised at a meeting between Jean-Claude Juncker and Theresa May in Brussels on 4 December. There was progress on the financial settlement and citizens' rights, but the meeting was abandoned after Northern Ireland's [[Democratic Unionist Party]] objected to arrangements for the Irish border; the agreement had earlier received the support of [[Leo Varadkar]], Ireland's [[Taoiseach]] (prime minister).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.ft.com/content/983b64e8-d8e0-11e7-a039-c64b1c09b482 |title=Brexit deal falls through over Irish border dispute |last1=Barker |first1=Alex |last2=Beesley |first2=Arthur |date=4 December 2017 |newspaper=Financial Times |archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=6 December 2017 |last3=Parker |first3=George|url-access=subscription}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Talks continued on the following days, leading to publication on 8 December of a joint report setting out the commitments to be reflected in the Withdrawal Agreement. "Agreement in principle" was reached on the three areas:
* protecting the rights of Union citizens in the UK and UK citizens in the Union
* the framework for addressing the unique circumstances of Northern Ireland
* the financial settlement.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://ec.europa.eu/commission/sites/beta-political/files/joint_report.pdf |title=Joint report from the negotiators of the European Union and the United Kingdom Government on progress during phase 1 of negotiations under Article 50 TEU on the United Kingdom's orderly withdrawal from the European Union |last= |first= |date=8 December 2017 |website=European Commission|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=8 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;
A joint technical note gave details of the consensus on citizens' rights.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://ec.europa.eu/commission/publications/joint-technical-note-expressing-detailed-consensus-uk-and-eu-positions-respect-citizens-rights_en |title=Joint technical note expressing the detailed consensus of the UK and EU positions on Citizens' Rights |last= |first= |date=8 December 2017 |website=European Commission|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=15 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Topics postponed to a later phase included:
* rights of UK citizens resident in an EU27 country on the withdrawal date to move to another EU27 country, and their right to return to the UK
* recognition of professional qualifications, beyond those already mutually recognised at the withdrawal date.
Juncker described the agreement as a "breakthrough" Brexit deal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-42277040 |title='Breakthrough' deal in Brexit talks |date=8 December 2017 |website=BBC News |accessdate=9 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The second phase of negotiations – concerning Britain's post-Brexit trade with the EU – will now be able to take place as a result of the agreement.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/britain-and-eu-reach-divorce-deal-to-move-on-to-new-phase-in-brexit-talks/2017/12/08/4525b332-dba4-11e7-a241-0848315642d0_story.html |title=Britain and E.U. reach divorce deal to move on to new phase in Brexit talks |first=Michael |last=Birnbaum |date=8 December 2017 |newspaper=The Washington Post |accessdate=9 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.reuters.com/article/uk-britain-eu/may-travels-to-brussels-in-hope-of-clinching-brexit-deal-idUSKBN1E20G6 |title=Britain, EU clinch Brexit 'breakthrough' with move to trade talks |date=9 December 2017 |website=Reuters |accessdate=9 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== January 2018 ===
Discussions on the outstanding issues continued and were described as "low-key".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2018/jan/29/brexit-uk-given-warning-over-outstanding-divorce-issues-eu |title=Brexit: UK given warning over outstanding divorce issues |last=Rankin |first=Jennifer |date=29 January 2018|newspaper=The Guardian|language=en|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=31 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== February 2018 ===
Several meetings took place between the negotiators.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://ec.europa.eu/commission/publications/programme-eu-uk-article-50-negotiations_en |title=Programme of EU-UK Article 50 negotiations |last= |first= |date=2 February 2018 |website=European Commission |language=en|access-date=25 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://ec.europa.eu/commission/publications/programme-eu-uk-article-50-negotiations-0_en |title=Programme of EU-UK Article 50 negotiations |last= |first= |date=16 February 2018 |website=European Commission |language=en|access-date=25 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===March 2018===
Due to the ambivalence of UK on the [[Irish border question]], Tusk declared in March 2018 "We know today that the UK Government rejects a customs and regulatory border down the Irish Sea, the EU single market, and the customs union."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/brexit-eu-talks-irish-border-tusk-varadkar-northern-ireland-uk-solution-dup-a8246216.html |title=EU freezes Brexit talks until Britain produces Irish border solution |date=8 March 2018 |newspaper=The Independent |accessdate=3 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Tusk's has said that talks cannot proceed around this issue, that it must be resolved first.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://news.sky.com/story/amp/may-warned-there-must-be-an-ireland-first-approach-to-brexit-talks-11281755 |title=May warned there must be an 'Ireland first' approach to Brexit talks |last=McGuinness |first=Alan |date=8 March 2018 |website=Sky News |access-date=30 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Negotiation phase 2: transitional arrangements ==

The second phase of the negotiation covers the arrangements for transition towards the UK's withdrawal, together with the framework for the future relationship.

On 15 December 2017, the European Council adopted guidelines for this phase. The document confirmed that progress in the first phase was "sufficient", while stating that commitments made in that phase must be "translated faithfully into legal terms as quickly as possible"; and notes the UK's proposal for a transition period of "around two years".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.consilium.europa.eu/en/press/press-releases/2017/12/15/european-council-art-50-guidelines-for-brexit-negotiations/ |title=European Council (Art. 50) guidelines for Brexit negotiations |last= |first= |date=15 December 2017 |website=European Council|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=15 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 20 December, the European Commission published a draft of the negotiating directives stating a transition period should not last beyond 31 December 2020. During the transition the United Kingdom would not be part of agreements the EU made on behalf of its members with third countries, such as [[CETA]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://ec.europa.eu/commission/sites/beta-political/files/annex_commissions_recommendation_20-12-2017.pdf |title=Commission's recommendation including supplementary negotiating directives |last= |first= |date=20 December 2017 |website=European Commission|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=21 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The European Council adopted and published negotiating directives on 29 January 2018. These state that the whole of the [[EU acquis]] (the rights and obligations binding on all member states) will continue to apply to the UK during the transition period. The UK will continue to be within the customs union and the single market, while no longer participating in EU decision-making.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.consilium.europa.eu/en/press/press-releases/2018/01/29/brexit-council-article-50-adopts-negotiating-directives-on-the-transition-period/ |title=Brexit: Council (Article 50) adopts negotiating directives on the transition period |last= |first= |date=29 January 2018 |website=European Commission|language=en|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=31 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The UK's position was outlined in speeches and interviews.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Brexit: who has said what about transition? |url=https://researchbriefings.parliament.uk/ResearchBriefing/Summary/CBP-8238 |website=House of Commons Library |accessdate=28 February 2018 |date=23 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In March 2018 resolution, the MEPs expect an EU-UK agreement which safeguard the framework of existing commercial relationships between the EU and third countries with consistency for keeping a tuned tariff and quota system and rules of origin for products vis-à-vis third and a countries,&lt;ref name="europa.eu1"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.europarl.europa.eu/sides/getDoc.do?pubRef=-//EP//NONSGML+TA+P8-TA-2018-0069+0+DOC+PDF+V0//EN |title=Guidelines on the framework of future EU-UK relations |date=14 March 2018 |website=European Parliament |access-date=30 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; and also a
transitional arrangements fully compatible with WTO obligations to not disrupt trade relations with third countries.&lt;ref name="europa.eu1"/&gt;

On 19 March 2018, the transition period has been agreed while it can not be considered legally binding until after ratification of a wider agreement on withdrawal: "Nothing is agreed until everything is agreed,".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2018/03/19/world/europe/uk-brexit-eu.html |title=U.K. Reaches Brexit Transition Deal With E.U. |last=Castle |first=Stephen |date=19 March 2018 |newspaper=The New York Times |access-date=30 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A curious development with this release was the avoidance of mentioning what will happen with the free movement rights of UK citizens living abroad on the basis of those rights. The section which previously stated that those rights would be removed, article 32, was removed from the agreement, although references to it remain in other parts of the document.

==Negotiation phase 3: trade relations with EU after Brexit==

=== July 2018 ===
The [[European Union (Withdrawal) Act 2018]] that became law in the United Kingdom on 26 June 2018, and [[European Union (Withdrawal) Act 2018#Connected legislation: world and cross-border trade|two bills]] that were then progressing through Parliament relating to world and cross-border trade after the withdrawal, allow for various outcomes including no negotiated settlement. The two bills passed from the House of Commons to the House of Lords in July 2018.

On 6 July 2018, the UK Government announced that the May Cabinet had agreed that it should propose a "UK-EU free trade area which establishes a common rule book for industrial goods and agricultural products" [but not services] after Brexit.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2018/jul/06/theresa-may-secures-approval-from-cabinet-to-negotiate-soft-brexit |title=Theresa May faces Tory anger over soft Brexit proposal |date=2 July 2018 |newspaper=The Guardian |access-date=30 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; A few days earlier, senior EU officials had intimated that a proposal for "partial" membership of the [[European Single Market]] would not be welcomed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2018/jul/02/uk-latest-brexit-proposal-is-unrealistic-say-eu-officials |title=UK's latest Brexit proposal is unrealistic, say EU officials |last=Rankin |first=Jennifer |date=2 July 2018 |newspaper=The Guardian |access-date=30 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Before the Cabinet meeting at [[Chequers]] on 6 July, Barnier stated that the EU would accept a trade agreement with the UK if it does not damage the European Single Market. However, he said the EU would not shift its own red line on the single market, which he said was "not and never should be seen as a big supermarket; it is economic, cultural and social life, it should be developed in all its dimensions".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2018/jul/06/michel-barnier-eu-willing-to-compromise-if-uk-softens-brexit-red-lines |title=Michel Barnier: EU willing to compromise if UK softens red lines |last=O'Carroll |first=Lisa |date=6 July 2018 |newspaper=The Guardian |access-date=30 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 10 July 2018, Barnier announced that 80% of the Brexit deal was now complete.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2018/jul/10/theresa-may-new-cabinet-boris-johnson-resignation-brexit-live |title=Two Tory party vice-chairs quit over Chequers Brexit plan – as it happened |first1=Peter |last1=Walker |first2=Jessica |last2=Elgot |first3=Graham |last3=Russell |first4=Kevin |last4=Rawlinson |date=10 July 2018 |newspaper=The Guardian |access-date=30 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The government published the "[[Chequers plan]]" on 12 July 2018. In response to a statement about it by the Secretary of State, the opposition spokesman said that it was a disgrace that it had been shown to the media from 9 a.m. that morning but it had not been shown to MPs until hours later.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2018/jul/12/brexit-white-paper-seeks-free-movement-for-skilled-workers-and-students |title=Brexit white paper seeks free movement for skilled workers and students |last1=Sabbagh |first1=Dan |last2=Walker |first2=Peter |date=12 July 2018 |newspaper=The Guardian |access-date=30 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While the President of the United States [[Donald Trump]] was on a visit to the United Kingdom on 13 July 2018, his comment – made in an exclusive interview with ''[[The Sun (United Kingdom)|The Sun]]'' – that the UK would probably not get a trade deal with the US if the prime minister's plan went ahead, was widely published in the media.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-44815558 |title=Donald Trump and Theresa May meet amid Brexit storm |date=13 July 2018 |website=BBC News |access-date=30 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Later the same day he stated, in a joint press conference with May at Chequers, that the Prime Minister was "doing a fantastic job" as prime minister, and contrary reports were "fake news", but he only asked for an "even" deal with the UK, and, complaining about EU trade barriers and tariffs on cars, he said that the US lost $151 billion to the EU.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.cbsnews.com/live-news/donald-trump-teresa-may-joint-press-conference-british-pm-uk-visit-today-2018-07-13-live-updates/ |title=Trump praises Theresa May after he questioned her Brexit plan in British tabloid interview |date=13 July 2018 |website=CBS News}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.politico.com/story/2018/07/13/trump-theresa-may-brexit-718462 |title=Trump eases up on May and Brexit: 'Whatever you do is OK with me' |website=Politico.com |date=13 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''The Sun'', which had conducted the interview with Trump that was the original source of the comment,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/6766531/trump-may-brexit-us-deal-off/ |title=I told May how to do Brexit but she wrecked it — US trade deal is off! |date=13 July 2018 |newspaper=The Sun}}&lt;/ref&gt; afterwards denied that it produced fake news and published the interview verbatim.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/6775873/the-suns-astonishing-interview-with-donald-trump-reverberated-around-the-world-yesterday/ |title=The Sun's explosive interview with Donald Trump stuns the world |date=13 July 2018|newspaper=The Sun}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While the negotiations continued, the UK government confirmed in the House of Commons on 19 July 2018 that the UK would be leaving the EU on 29 March 2019, as stated in the withdrawal act and the white paper.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.express.co.uk/news/uk/991165/Brexit-news-update-Article-50-extension-Peter-Bone-UK-Parliament-latest |title=EU plot will fail: Bone forces Brexit minister to promise Article 50 won't be extended |date=19 July 2018 |newspaper=Daily Express |access-date=30 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first meeting of Dominic Raab, the newly appointed UK Secretary of State for Exiting the European Union, with the EU's chief negotiator, Michel Barnier, was later on the same day (19 July 2018) in Brussels. Raab offered to meet Barnier throughout August to "intensify" talks, while both the UK and EU were insisting that reaching agreement by the autumn on the UK withdrawal in March 2019 was still very much on the cards.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-44880968 |title=New Brexit Secretary Dominic Raab vows to 'intensify' talks |date=19 July 2018 |website=BBC News |access-date=30 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 20 July 2018, May repeated her opposition to the EU's proposals for the [[Irish border question]] during a speech in Belfast, stating that the EU must "evolve" and that there would be no further compromises over the issue.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-northern-ireland-44892385 |title=EU must 'evolve' Brexit position - PM |date=20 July 2018 |website=BBC News}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=july20 /&gt; Just hours after the Prime Minister's remarks,&lt;ref name=july20 /&gt; Barnier expressed skepticism towards the Chequers plan.&lt;ref name=july20&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/brexit-latest-eu-uk-chequers-white-paper-michel-barnier-theresa-may-a8456416.html |title=EU chief Brexit negotiator Michel Barnier takes apart Theresa May's Chequers white paper plan |newspaper=The Independent |date=20 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 24 July 2018, May announced that she would now lead the Brexit negotiations with the EU and that Raab was now only "deputizing" on her behalf.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-44941792 |title=May takes control of Brexit negotiations |date=24 July 2018 |website=BBC News}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2018/jul/24/brexit-raab-sidelined-as-may-takes-control-of-eu-negotiations |title=Brexit: Raab 'sidelined' as May takes control of EU negotiations |first=Pippa |last=Crerar |date=24 July 2018|newspaper=The Guardian}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 26 July, Barnier held another meeting with Raab and both stated afterwards stated in a joint press conference that "sufficient progress" had been made in the trade negotiations.&lt;ref name=july26 /&gt; Raab also stated during the joint press conference that "a lot has been achieved."&lt;ref name=telegraphyjuly26&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2018/07/26/eus-chief-negotiator-major-issues-deal-brexit-negotiations/ |title=EU's chief negotiator: there are 'major issues' to deal with in Brexit negotiations |first=Mickey |last=Carroll |date=26 July 2018|newspaper=The Daily Telegraph}}&lt;/ref&gt; Barnier also stated that both sides wanted a wide-ranging free trade deal and that he would meet again with Raab in mid-August.&lt;ref name=july26&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.bbc.com/news/44964521 |title=Barnier rules out UK's customs proposal |date=26 July 2018 |website=BBC News}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, he also acknowledged that obstacles remained due to the White Paper's proposal to allow Britain to collect custom duties on behalf of the EU and that the proposal would never be accepted for any non-member.&lt;ref name=july26 /&gt; Barnier also stated that the only other challenge in the trade negotiations was finalizing an agreement between both sides concerning a [[Irish border question#Backstop agreement|backstop that guarantees a frictionless border]] between Ireland and Northern Ireland.&lt;ref name=telegraphyjuly26 /&gt; Barnier stated that the EU holds "no objections in principle" to the backstop, but has "doubts that it can be done without putting at risk the integrity of [[European Union Customs Union|our customs union]], [[European Single Market|our common commercial policy]], our regulatory policy and our fiscal revenue."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-britain-eu-barnier/eu-rejects-britains-key-elements-of-special-customs-plan-after-brexit-idUSKBN1KG2K0 |title=EU rejects Britain's key elements of special customs plan after Brexit |first=Jan |last=Strupczewski |website=Reuters |date=26 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 28 June 2016, five days after the referendum, Chancellor of Germany [[Angela Merkel]] announced to the German parliament the forthcoming EU negotiation position: the UK could only remain in the [[European Single Market]] (ESM) if the UK accepted EU migrants. There would be no [[wiktionary:Cherry picking|cherrypicking]] of the ESM's four conditions (free movement of goods, capital, services and labour). While she expected the UK to remain an important NATO partner, the EU's priority was unity and self-preservation. She warned the UK not to delude itself.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.welt.de/politik/deutschland/article156631505/Mit-Merkel-wird-es-kein-Rosinenpicken-fuer-die-Briten-geben.html |title=Brexit-Bundestagsdebatte: Mit Merkel wird es kein Rosinenpicken für die Briten geben |trans-title=Brexit parliamentary debate: With Merkel there will be no cherrypicking for the British |newspaper=[[Die Welt]] |language=de |date=28 June 2016 |accessdate=14 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The next day, Tusk confirmed that the UK would not be allowed access to the ESM unless they accepted its four freedoms of movement for goods, capital, services, and people.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Heffer |first=Greg |date=29 June 2016 |title='It's not single market à la carte' Donald Tusk tells UK it's Free Movement or Nothing |url=http://www.express.co.uk/news/politics/684528/Brexit-Donald-Tusk-Britain-free-movement-access-EU-single-market-David-Cameron |newspaper=Daily Express |access-date=1 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In contrast, at her October 2016 party conference, Prime Minister Theresa May emphasised that ending the jurisdiction of EU law and free movement from Europe were priorities. She wished "to give British companies the maximum freedom to trade with and operate in the Single Market – and let European businesses do the same here", but not at the expense of losing sovereignty.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |date=2 October 2016 |title=Theresa May – her full Brexit speech to Conservative conference |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/theresa-may-conference-speech-article-50-brexit-eu-a7341926.html |newspaper=The Independent |access-date=14 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Mason |first=Rowena |date=5 October 2016 |title=Theresa May's Conservative party conference speech – key points analysed |url=https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/oct/05/mays-conservative-party-conference-speech-key-points-analysed |newspaper=The Guardian|access-date=14 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In November 2016, May proposed that Britain and the other EU countries mutually guarantee the residency rights of the 3.3 million EU immigrants in Britain and those of the 1.2 million British citizens living on the Continent, in order to exclude their fates being bargained during Brexit negotiations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2016/11/22/british-expats-set-granted-right-carry-living-eu-theresa-mays |title=British expats set to be granted right to carry on living in EU with Theresa May 'close to reciprocal rights deal' |last=Hope |first=Christopher |date=23 November 2016|newspaper=The Daily Telegraph |accessdate=18 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite initial approval from a majority of EU states, May's proposal was blocked by European Council President Tusk and German Chancellor Merkel.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2016/11/29/donald-tusk-accuses-british-voters-backed-brexit-creating-anxiety/ |title=Angela Merkel says 'nein' to Theresa May's calls for early deal on rights of EU migrants and British ex-pats |last=Swinford |first=Steven |date=29 November 2016|newspaper=The Daily Telegraph |accessdate=18 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In January 2017, the Prime Minister presented 12 negotiating objectives and confirmed that the UK government would not seek permanent [[British membership of the European Economic Area|single market membership]].&lt;ref name="auto" /&gt; The European Parliament's lead negotiator [[Guy Verhofstadt]] responded that there could be no "cherry-picking" by the UK in the talks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-38641208 |title=Brexit: UK to leave single market, says Theresa May |last=Kuenssberg |first=Laura |date=17 January 2017 |website=BBC News |access-date=14 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The statutory period for negotiation began on 29 March 2017, when the letter notifying withdrawal, signed by the British Prime Minister, was handed to the president of the European Council. The letter called for a "deep and special relationship" between the UK and the EU, and warned that failure to reach an agreement would result in EU-UK trade under World Trade Organisation terms, and a weakening of the UK's cooperation in the fight against crime and terrorism. The letter suggested prioritising an early deal on the rights of EU citizens in the UK and vice versa. In the letter, the Prime Minister reasoned that, as the EU leaders did not wish "cherry picking" of the ESM, the UK would not seek to remain within the ESM. Instead, the UK would seek a free trade agreement with the EU.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-39431070 |date=29 March 2017 |website=BBC News |title=Brexit: The UK's letter triggering Article 50|access-date=15 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; In response, Merkel insisted that the EU would not discuss future cooperation without first settling the divorce, Verhofstadt referred to the letter as "blackmail" with regard to the point on security and terrorism, and EU Commission president [[Jean-Claude Juncker]] said the UK's decision to quit the block was a "choice they will regret one day".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Asthana |first=Anushka |date=30 March 2017 |title=Don't blackmail us over security, EU warns May |url=https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2017/mar/29/brexit-eu-condemns-mays-blackmail-over-security-cooperation |newspaper=The Guardian |access-date=15 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 29 April 2017, immediately after the first round of French presidential elections, the EU27 heads of state accepted, without discussion,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Boffey |first=Daniel |date=29 April 2017 |title=EU leaders agree on tough stance at special Brexit summit |url=https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2017/apr/29/eu-leaders-set-to-take-tough-stance-in-special-brexit-summit |newspaper=The Guardian|access-date=14 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; negotiating guidelines prepared by the [[President of the European Council]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.consilium.europa.eu/en/press/press-releases/2017/04/29-euco-brexit-guidelines/ |last= |first= |date=29 April 2017 |website=Council of the European Union |title=European Council (Art. 50) guidelines for Brexit negotiations |access-date=14 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The guidelines take the view that Article 50 permits a two-phased negotiation, whereby the UK first needs to agree to a financial commitment and to lifelong benefits for EU citizens in Britain, before the EU27 will entertain negotiations on a future relationship.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2017/04/29/eu-brexit-guidelines-document-really-means/ |title=EU Brexit guidelines: What's in the document, and what it really means |last=Foster |first=Peter |date=29 April 2017|newspaper=The Daily Telegraph |access-date=14 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the requested first phase of the withdrawal negotiation, the EU27 negotiators demand the UK pay a "divorce bill", initially estimated as amounting up to £52bn and then, after additional financial demands from Germany, France, and Poland, amounting to £92bn.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Worstall |first=Tim |date=3 May 2017 |title=It Is To Laugh At Their Mistake – EU's Brexit Bill Claim Now At €100 Billion |url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/timworstall/2017/05/03/it-is-to-laugh-at-their-mistake-eus-brexit-bill-claim-now-at-e100-billion/2/#61adde837b74 |website=Forbes |access-date=15 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless, a report of the [[European Union Committee]] of the House of Lords published on 4 March 2017 states that if there is no post-Brexit deal at the end of the two-year negotiating period, the UK could withdraw without payment.&lt;ref name="bbc.co.uk"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-39154218 |title=Brexit: UK 'not obliged' to pay divorce bill say peers |date=4 March 2017 |website=BBC News |access-date=30 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, the Prime Minister insisted to EU Commission President Juncker that talks about the future UK-EU relationship should start early and that Britain did not owe any money to the EU under the current treaties.&lt;ref name="auto1"&gt;{{cite news |last=Roberts |first=Dan |date=1 May 2017 |title=May dismisses reports of frosty dinner with EU chief as 'Brussels gossip' |url=https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2017/may/01/jean-claude-juncker-to-theresa-may-on-brexit-im-10-times-more-sceptical-than-i-was-before |newspaper=The Guardian|access-date=15 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On the EU27 side, unflattering details of a four-way meeting between Prime Minister Theresa May, Brexit Minister David Davis, EU Commission President Juncker and his chief-of-staff [[Martin Selmayr]] were leaked to the German newspaper ''Frankfurter Allgemeine Sonntagszeitung'', presumably by Martin Selmayr.&lt;ref name="auto4"&gt;{{cite news |last=Bush |first=Stephen |date=2 May 2017 |title=Theresa May and Jean-Claude Juncker's dinner leaked because no-one thinks Brexit will work |url=http://www.newstatesman.com/politics/staggers/2017/05/theresa-may-and-jean-claude-junckers-dinner-leaked-because-no-one-thinks |newspaper=New Statesman |access-date=15 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to the leaked description, Juncker claimed that Theresa May was "living in another galaxy" when suggesting that British and EU migrant rights could be rapidly negotiated and agreed in the course of June 2017. German Chancellor Angela Merkel concurred the next day by stating that there were "illusions" on the British side.&lt;ref name="auto1" /&gt; A few days later, Juncker disclaimed responsibility and called the leak a mistake, ''Der Spiegel'' magazine reported that Angela Merkel was annoyed with Juncker for the leak, while European Council President Tusk admonished participants to use discretion during the negotiations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Juncker's jibes continue after Tusk calls for calm |quote=In order to succeed we need discretion, moderation and a maximum of goodwill. |last=Stone |first=Mark |url=http://news.sky.com/story/tusk-warns-over-brexit-emotions-as-juncker-takes-another-swipe-10864632 |website=Sky News |date=6 May 2017 |accessdate=15 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The background for German nervousness allegedly is the possibility that Britain may veto EU budget increases, which for example in the immediate term amount to 4 billion euros. A continued British veto would have far-reaching consequences and "will hurt us" according to German MEP Jens Geier.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.spiegel.de/politik/ausland/angela-merkel-veraergert-ueber-jean-claude-juncker-nach-brexit-dinner-a-1146299.html |title= Treffen mit May: Merkel verärgert über Juncker nach Brexit-Dinner |trans-title= Meeting with May: Merkel annoyed with Juncker after Brexit dinner |newspaper=[[Der Spiegel]] |language=de |date=6 May 2017 |accessdate=15 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 22 May 2017, the European Council authorised its negotiators to start the Brexit talks and it adopted its negotiating directives.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.consilium.europa.eu/en/press/press-releases/2017/05/22-brexit-negotiating-directives/ |title=Council (Art 50) authorises the start of Brexit talks and adopts negotiating directives |website=European Council}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first day of talks took place on 19 June, where Davis and Barnier agreed to prioritise the question of residency rights, while Davis conceded that a discussion of the Northern Irish border would have to await future trade agreements.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2017/jun/19/uk-caves-in-to-eu-demand-to-agree-divorce-bill-before-trade-talks |title=Brexit: UK caves in to EU demand to agree divorce bill before trade talks |date=19 June 2017 |newspaper=The Guardian |access-date=20 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 22 June 2017, Prime Minister May guaranteed, at a European Council meeting in [[City of Brussels|Brussels]], that no EU citizen living legally in the UK would be forced to leave, and she offered that any EU citizen living in the UK for more than 5 years until an unspecified deadline between March 2017 and March 2019 would enjoy the same rights as a UK citizen, conditional on the EU providing the same offer to British expatriates living in the EU. The EU leaders did not immediately reciprocate the offer, with Council President Tusk objecting that the European Council is not a forum for the Brexit negotiations, and Commission president Juncker stating "I'm not negotiating here."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2017/jun/22/donald-tusk-john-lennon-eu-summit-uk-britain-brexit |newspaper=The Guardian |location=London |title=Donald Tusk echoes John Lennon to suggest UK could stay in EU |first=Daniel |last=Boffey |date=22 June 2017 |accessdate=23 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Prime Minister detailed her residency proposals in the House of Commons on 26 June 2017, but drew no concessions from EU negotiators,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.lemonde.fr/europe/article/2017/06/27/brexit-les-expatries-premier-bras-de-fer-entre-londres-et-bruxelles_5151696_3214.html |newspaper=[[Le Monde]] |location=Paris |language=fr |title=Brexit: les expatriés, premier bras de fer entre Londres et Bruxelles |trans-title=Brexit: Expatriates, the first arm-wrestling match between London and Brussels |first=Eric |last=Abert |date=27 June 2017 |accessdate=27 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; who had declined to expedite agreement on expatriates by the end of June 2017,&lt;ref name="auto4" /&gt; and who are hoping for European courts to continue to have jurisdiction in the UK with regards to EU citizens, according to their negotiation aims published in May 2017.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.nzz.ch/international/brexit-verhandlungen-london-will-eu-buerger-in-grossbritannien-halten-ld.1302924 |title=Brexit-Verhandlungen: London will EU-Bürger in Grossbritannien halten |trans-title=Brexit negotiations: London wants to keep EU citizens in Britain |newspaper=[[Neue Zürcher Zeitung]] |language=de |date=26 June 2017 |accessdate=27 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Reality Check: Britain and EU at odds over citizens' rights |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-40413041 |website=BBC News |date=27 June 2017 |accessdate=27 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The second round of negotiations began in Brussels in mid-July 2017. It is considered the beginning of substantial negotiations, with 98 UK negotiators and 45 EU27 negotiators.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.pressreader.com/uk/the-scotsman/20170718/281625305353947 |newspaper=[[The Scotsman]]|title=EU hands Britain a two-month deadline on Brexit talks |first=Paris |last=Gourtsoyannis |date=18 July 2017 |accessdate=19 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Progress is being made on the Northern Irish border question, whereas UK negotiators have requested a detailed breakdown of the "divorce bill" demand estimated at 65 billion euros, while the EU negotiators criticise the UK's citizenship rights offer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |newspaper=The Irish Times |date=20 July 2017 |url=https://www.irishtimes.com/news/politics/eu-and-uk-singing-off-same-hymn-sheet-on-northern-ireland-1.3160534 |accessdate=20 July 2017 |title=EU and UK 'singing off same hymn sheet' on Northern Ireland}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the concluding press conference, David Davis did not commit to a net payment by the UK to the EU with regards to the requested divorce bill, while Michel Barnier explained that he would not compromise on his demand for the European Court of Justice to have continuing jurisdiction over the rights of EU citizens living in the UK after Brexit,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.nzz.ch/international/zweite-verhandlungsrunde-in-bruessel-london-bleibt-zu-brexit-rechnung-unverbindlich-ld.1307012 |title=Zweite Verhandlungsrunde in Brüssel: London bleibt zu Brexit-Rechnung unverbindlich |trans-title=Second round of negotiations in Brussels: London remains non-committal to Brexit bill |newspaper=Neue Zürcher Zeitung |language=de |first=Niklus |last=Nuspliger |date=20 July 2017 |accessdate=21 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; rejecting the compromise proposal of a new international body made up of British and EU judges.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-40662740 |title=Brexit: UK and EU at odds over 'exit bill' |website=BBC News |date=21 July 2017 |access-date=21 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 16 August 2017, the British government disclosed the first of several papers detailing British ambitions following Brexit, discussing trade and customs arrangements.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.joc.com/international-logistics/brexit-customs-proposal-short-details-say-uk-forwarders_20170816.html |title=UK forwarders: Brexit customs proposal short on details |date=16 August 2017 |newspaper=[[The Journal of Commerce]] |accessdate=9 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 23 August 2017, Prime Minister Theresa May announced that Britain will leave the EU Court of Justice's direct jurisdiction when the Brexit transition period that is planned after March 2019 ends, but that both the British courts and the EU Court of Justice will also keep "half an eye" on each other's rulings afterwards as well.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-41012265 |title=PM: UK leaving EU court's jurisdiction |date=23 August 2017 |website=BBC News |accessdate=9 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; One of the UK government's position papers published in August called for no additional restrictions for goods already on the market in the UK and EU.&lt;ref name="auto3"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-41089257 |title=Brexit: Jean-Claude Juncker criticises UK's position papers |date=30 August 2017 |website=BBC News |access-date=30 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The third round of negotiations began in Brussels on 28 August 2017. The European Commission president Juncker criticised the UK's Brexit negotiations, saying none of the papers provided so far were satisfactory and that there would be no trade negotiations between the EU and UK until the divorce bill was settled. He had previously claimed that the UK's Brexit bill could be £55bn (which Theresa May's government ministers consider unacceptable)&lt;ref name="auto3"/&gt; and EU Budget Commissioner [[Günther Oettinger]] voiced the view that the UK should make payments until 2023.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Briten müssen bis 2023 Zahlungen an die EU leisten |trans-title=The British must make payments to the EU until 2023 |newspaper=Die Welt |url=https://www.welt.de/politik/ausland/article168235792/Briten-muessen-bis-2023-Zahlungen-an-die-EU-leisten.html |accessdate=2 September 2017 |first=Christoph| last= Schiltz |date=2 September 2016|language=German}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ''Irish Times'' explained the disagreement as follows: British negotiators referred to the seven-year [[Multiannual Financial Framework]] (MFF or Maff) for the period 2014-2020 agreed by member states and the EU parliament as a "planning tool" for the next period rather than a legally-binding financial obligation on member states. The British case is that the MFF sets ceilings on spending under various headings and is later radically revised during the annual budget process when real legal obligations on each state arises. This contrasts with the EU Commission's methodology for calculating the UK Brexit bill which involves dividing the MFF into the shares historically agreed by each member state.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |newspaper=The Irish Times |date=31 August 2017 |url=https://www.irishtimes.com/news/world/europe/huge-gulf-in-negotiations-on-uk-s-brexit-bill-1.3203800 |accessdate=2 September 2017 |title=Huge gulf in negotiations on UK's Brexit bill}}&lt;/ref&gt; On the Irish border question there was a "breakthrough", with the British side guaranteeing free movement of EU citizens within the [[Common travel area]] constituting Ireland and the United Kingdom.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |newspaper=The Irish Times |date=1 September 2017 |url=https://www.irishtimes.com/news/world/europe/major-breakthrough-in-irish-strand-of-brexit-talks-1.3205341 |accessdate=2 September 2017 |title=Major breakthrough in Irish strand of Brexit talks}}&lt;/ref&gt; The BBC's Europe correspondent commented "the British perception of the talks is more positive than the EU's".&lt;ref name="auto3"/&gt;

At the elite European [[Ambrosetti Forum]] on 2 September 2017, Michel Barnier explained his negotiation aims, in that he would "teach the British people and others what leaving the EU means".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/michel-barnier-david-davis-brexit-educational-teach-uk-leaving-single-market-negotiations-a7927336.html |title=EU chief negotiator Michel Barnier says he will 'teach the UK what leaving the single market means' |newspaper=The Independent |date=3 September 2017|access-date=3 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although this remark caused controversy in the UK, BBC correspondent Mark Mardell interpreted it in the context of French and Dutch euroscepticism, of the forthcoming German, Austrian and Italian elections, and of the eurosceptic Polish and Hungarian governments.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-41141650 |title=Brexit: A lakeside view of Barnier's tough talk |website=BBC News |date=4 September 2017|access-date=4 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a statement to Parliament on 5 September 2017, David Davis said that "concrete progress" had been made over the summer in areas such as protecting the rights of British expats in the EU to access healthcare and over the future of the Irish border, while significant differences over the "divorce bill" remain.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-41155578 |title=Brexit: 'Significant differences' over exit bill says Davis |website=BBC News |date=5 September 2017 |access-date=5 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; He expected that "the money argument will go on for the full duration of the negotiation. The famous European "nothing is agreed until everything is agreed" will apply here absolutely, as anywhere else".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |newspaper=The Irish Times |url=https://www.irishtimes.com/news/world/uk/britain-may-hold-out-on-brexit-divorce-cash-until-last-minute-1.3210638 |title=Britain may hold out on Brexit divorce cash until last minute |date=5 September 2017 |accessdate=5 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 6 September 2017, Prime Minister May announced that new immigration controls will be placed on EU nationals when Brexit concludes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2017/sep/06/theresa-may-backs-new-eu-immigration-controls-after-brexit-leak |title=Theresa May defends new EU immigration controls after Brexit leak |first1=Heather |last1=Stewart |first2=Peter |last2=Walker |date=6 September 2017 |newspaper=The Guardian |accessdate=9 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 9 September 2017, the EU Commission published several negotiating papers, including "Guiding Principles on the Dialogue for Ireland/Northern Ireland". In it, the EU concedes/declares that it is the responsibility of the UK to propose solutions for the post-Brexit Irish border. The paper envisages that a "unique" solution would be permissible here; in other words, any such exceptional Irish solution should not be seen as a template for post-Brexit relationships with the other EU members on border and customs control matters, for example [[ETIAS]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |newspaper=The Irish Times |url=https://www.irishtimes.com/news/ireland/irish-news/don-t-use-irish-border-as-test-case-for-eu-uk-border-says-barnier-1.3212836 |title=Don't use Irish Border as test case for EU-UK border, says Barnier |date=7 September 2017 |accessdate=7 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At the [[List of European Council meetings#2010–present|European Council meeting]] of 19/20 October 2017, the 27 leaders of the EU states were to decide whether or not to start trade negotiations with the UK.&lt;ref name="auto3"/&gt; However, David Davis has conceded that so soon after the German elections on 24 September, a German coalition government may not be in place in time for making this decision in October, delaying any European Council decision until their December meeting.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2017/09/07/brexit-trade-talks-deadline-slip-december-says-european-parliament/ |title=Brexit trade talks deadline to slip to December, says European Parliament chief |last=Foster |first=Peter |date=7 September 2017|newspaper=The Daily Telegraph |accessdate=7 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="auto2"/&gt;

On the domestic front, Labour Party MP and [[Shadow Home Secretary]] [[Diane Abbott]] announced she would back May's proposed negotiation for the Brexit timetable.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://news.sky.com/story/diane-abbott-backs-theresa-mays-two-year-brexit-transition-plan-11051125 |title=Diane Abbott backs Theresa May's two-year Brexit transition plan |date=24 September 2017 |website=Sky News |accessdate=9 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The programme for the fourth round of talks beginning on 25 September arranged for meetings between the "Principals" and for three negotiating groups covering citizens' rights, financial settlement and other separation issues, while Northern Ireland issues would be addressed by the "Coordinators", and governance of the withdrawal agreement would be discussed at technical level.&lt;ref name="European Union 2017"/&gt;

On 16 October, May and European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker issued a joint statement agreeing Brexit talks should "accelerate over the months to come" following a dinner meeting in Brussels which both described as "constructive and friendly."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-41642051 |title=PM and EU: Let's speed up Brexit talks |date=17 October 2017 |website=BBC News |accessdate=9 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.standard.co.uk/news/politics/theresa-may-and-eu-president-jeanclaude-juncker-promise-to-speed-up-brexit-talks-after-constructive-a3660231.html |title=Theresa May and Jean-Claude Juncker promise to 'accelerate' Brexit talks after 'constructive and friendly dinner' |date=16 October 2017 |newspaper=[[Evening Standard]] |accessdate=9 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/brexit-talks-theresa-may-jean-claude-juncker-brussels-dinner-accelerate-a8003866.html |title=Theresa May and EU president Juncker agree Brexit talks should 'accelerate' |date=16 October 2017 |newspaper=The Independent |accessdate=9 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2017/10/16/theresa-may-jean-claude-juncker-pledge-accelerate-brexit-negotiations/ |title=Theresa May and Jean-Claude Juncker pledge to 'accelerate' Brexit talks - but fail to break deadlock |first1=Steven |last1=Swinford |first2=James |last2=Crisp |first3=Peter |last3=Foster |date=16 October 2017|newspaper=The Daily Telegraph |accessdate=9 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, as at a similar dinner earlier in 2017, an unflattering "impressionistic" account of this meeting (between Prime Minister Theresa May, her chief Brexit adviser Olly Robbins, Brexit Minister David Davis, EU Commission President Juncker and the EU's chief negotiator, Michel Barnier) was published in the same German newspaper ''Frankfurter Allgemeine Sonntagszeitung''. Again, Juncker's chief-of-staff [[Martin Selmayr]] was accused as the source of the publication and of trying to undermine the negotiations. This time however Selmayr denied the accusation, and Chancellor Merkel reportedly denied her involvement.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Merkel "wütend" über Bericht zu May und Juncker |language=de |trans-title=Merkel "angry" about report on May and Juncker |url=https://derstandard.at/2000066611637/Merkel-wuetend-ueber-Bericht-zu-May-und-Juncker |date=24 October 2017 |accessdate=25 October 2017 |newspaper=[[Der Standard]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Boffey |first=Daniel |date=24 October 2017 |title=Juncker rejects claim May begged for help at dinner meeting |url=https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2017/oct/22/mays-ex-policy-chief-claims-juncker-aide-leaked-brexit-dinner-details |newspaper=The Guardian|access-date=25 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 17 October, Brexit Secretary David Davis insisted that there will be no deal for a transition phase without EU cooperation and that Brexit will happen regardless, even if there is what one Conservative MP described as "a bridge to nowhere."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/david-davis-no-deal-brexit-uk-transition-period-conservative-theresa-may-eu-relationship-a8005196.html |title=David Davis just significantly cut the odds on a 'no deal' Brexit |date=17 October 2017 |newspaper=The Independent |accessdate=9 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 19 October, the first day of the two-day European Council meeting in Brussels, May issued a direct message to approximately three million EU citizens living in Britain, promising she will make it as easy as possible for them to stay after Brexit.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.scotsman.com/news/politics/agreement-on-eu-citizens-in-uk-within-touching-distance-1-4590816 |title=Agreement on EU citizens in UK 'within touching distance' |date=19 October 2017 |newspaper=The Scotsman |accessdate=9 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 20 October, Tusk described media reports of the deadlock in Brexit talks as "exaggerated."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-41684111 |title=Brexit deadlock talk 'exaggerated' - Tusk |date=20 October 2017 |website=BBC News |accessdate=9 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 23 October, May announced to the House of Commons that Brexit talks underwent "important progress" during her recent meeting with the European Council and that Britain was now "in touching distance" of a trade deal with EU countries,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-41720244 |title=May hails 'important progress' in EU talks |date=23 October 2017 |website=BBC News |accessdate=9 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.dailystar.co.uk/news/politics/654521/brexit-theresa-may-UK-in-touching-distance-of-brussels-deal-jeremy-corbyn-expats |title=Brits on the brink of Brexit: Theresa May says UK 'in touching distance' of Brussels deal |date=23 October 2017|newspaper=[[Daily Star (United Kingdom)|Daily Star]] |accessdate=9 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; while also reiterating that no transition phase will take place following the conclusion of Brexit without a trade deal as well.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/politics/blog/live/2017/oct/23/theresa-may-commons-brexit-statement-leak-saying-may-was-begging-for-help-at-dinner-with-juncker-triggers-fresh-row-with-brussels-politics-live |title=May implies UK will not implement Brexit transition unless trade deal agreed too - Politics live |first=Andrew |last=Sparrow |date=23 October 2017|newspaper=The Guardian |accessdate=9 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The same day, Juncker denied reports by the German media that May had "begged for help" during their recent dinner meeting.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2017/oct/22/mays-ex-policy-chief-claims-juncker-aide-leaked-brexit-dinner-details |title=Juncker rejects claim May begged for help at dinner meeting |first=Daniel |last=Boffey |date=23 October 2017|newspaper=The Guardian |accessdate=9 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the wake of the German elections (23 September 2017), as of 10 November, negotiations were still ongoing to form a coalition government between Frau Merkel's CDU, the sister party CSU, the economically liberal FDP and the German Greens; politicians from all three factions published an appeal to reach a coalition agreement (rather than risk new elections), in the interest of Germany forming a "stable anchor" to unite with France and defend the EU and the euro in the current situation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Merkel versucht Brückenschlag bei Jamaika-Streitthema Klima |language=de |trans-title=Merkel tries to build bridges in "Jamaica" dispute on climate |url=https://derstandard.at/2000067640939/Merkel-versucht-Brueckenschlag-bei-Jamaika-Streitthema-Klima |date=11 November 2017 |newspaper=Der Standard |accessdate=11 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the sixth round of meetings in Brussels between UK and EU negotiators on 9–10 November, Michel Barnier set the UK a deadline of two weeks to specify a divorce bill that the UK would pay, without which the UK would not be permitted to start trade negotiations in December 2017. Meanwhile, David Davis rejected an EU proposal that Northern Ireland could remain in the EU customs union (thereby creating a customs border "down the [[Irish Sea]]" with [[Great Britain]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-41941414 |title=Brexit bill: Barnier gives UK two weeks to clarify key issues |website=BBC News |date=10 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After more than 2 months of a caretaker German government since the German federal elections in September, on 7 December 2017 new elections were averted when the German socialist party under Martin Schulz agreed to negotiate a coalition government with [[Angela Merkel]]'s Christian Democrat party, but on condition that a "United States of Europe" be created by 2025, dismissing those EU member states who were unwilling to participate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/dec/07/martin-schulz-united-states-of-europe-germany-sdp |title=Martin Schulz wants 'United States of Europe' within eight years |first=Philip |last=Oltermann |date=7 December 2017|newspaper=The Guardian |accessdate=8 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The following day (8 December), the UK and EU negotiators agreed on the principle that "nothing is agreed until everything is agreed" and formally announced to proceed immediately to the next phase of talks on a transition period and future trade relationships.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |newspaper=The Irish Times |date=8 December 2017 |url=https://www.irishtimes.com/news/world/uk/brexit-breakthrough-may-pledges-no-hard-border-as-commission-says-sufficient-progress-made-1.3320030 |accessdate=8 December 2017 |title=Brexit breakthrough: May pledges 'no hard border' as commission says 'sufficient progress' made}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-42280487 |title=Brexit deal: Theresa May's agreement with Brussels |last=Morris |first=Chris |date=8 December 2017 |website=BBC News|access-date=11 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The EU's negotiating position as at 10 November 2017 was that a future trade relationship between EU and UK should be made conditional upon requirements which would handicap the UK's freedom to negotiate free trade deals with the rest of the world; and that no free trade deal can be agreed in parallel with the Article 50 withdrawal agreement because each of the 27 EU countries would be expected to veto it if they would otherwise face competition from the UK on tax, employment conditions, safety regulations and relaxation of restrictions on GM crops; and that the EU would require any transitional deal to be signed as part of a withdrawal agreement before any agreement was in place on the UK's future relationship with the EU, so that existing arrangements would continue to apply during any transitional period, with the Single Market, Customs Union and European Court of Justice having the same roles as at present, and preventing the UK having control of EU immigration during that period or having the right to enter into trade deals with other countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://brexitcentral.com/meeting-michel-barnier-guy-verhofstadt-ive-concluded-no-deal-will-better-deal/ |title=After meeting Michel Barnier and Guy Verhofstadt, I've concluded that 'no deal' will be better than their deal |website=BrexitCentral |date=10 November 2017 |accessdate=10 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Legality of payments by the UK to the EU ==
Two different but incompatible legal approaches would be considered for the Brexit. The EU approach is top down while the British approach is bottom-up. This difference of approach raises a serious problem of confidence.&lt;ref name="independent.co.uk"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/brexit-eu-divorce-bill-payment-michel-barnier-david-davis-backtracking-brussels-a7934296.html |title=Britain is 'backtracking' on its Brexit divorce bill commitments, EU's chief negotiator warns |date=7 September 2017|newspaper=The Independent |accessdate=22 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; From Michel Barnier point of view, what was decided by 28 member states, has to be paid by 28 member states till the end.&lt;ref name="independent.co.uk"/&gt;

The issue of payments by the UK to the EU as part of the exit agreement is subject to much conjecture and has been divided into two broad questions. Firstly, whether a leaving state is legally obligated to contribute to the EU budget beyond its membership period or compensate for any financial losses that EU may suffer on account of withdrawal, given that Article 50 does not concern itself with financial ramifications of a withdrawal; and secondly – if the United Kingdom is legally obligated to pay – what should be the due amount.

The leaders of France and Germany have both stated that the UK would need to agree terms regarding the departure before discussing future relationships.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url= http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-4359418/PM-gathers-Cabinet-ahead-Article-50-triggered.html |title=Security threats, insults and a £50billion divorce bill: Merkel and Hollande warn of painful Brexit as they reject Britain's call for early trade talks – while PM threatens to cut intelligence ties if we get a bad deal as she triggers Article 50 |newspaper=Daily Mail |date=29 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; This has been reinforced by EU27 guidelines issued to the remaining 27 countries.&lt;ref name="Sky313"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://news.sky.com/story/european-union-to-reveal-its-brexit-negotiating-approach-10818836 |title=Brexit EU guidelines: UK told settle divorce bill before talking trade deals |website=Sky News |date=31 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The UK has signalled that it may consider paying the EU to attain preferential access to the economic Single Market and may offer to pay liabilities, even if not legally obligated, on a moral and co-operative basis to secure a preferential working relationship with the EU.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=David Davis suggests UK could pay for single market access |url=https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/dec/01/brexit-secretary-suggests-uk-would-consider-paying-for-single-market-access |newspaper=The Guardian |date=1 December 2016 |accessdate=2 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The highest reported claim by the EU is around €60 billion (£50 billion{{when|£50 billion|date=December 2018}}). In March 2017 the [[Bruegel (institution)|Bruegel think tank]] estimated that the UK would need to pay at least €25.4 billion, but the method of calculation is debatable and their calculations using seven different methods produced estimates between €30 and €45 billion.&lt;ref name="IT303"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.irishtimes.com/business/economy/uk-s-brexit-bill-likely-to-be-well-under-60bn-says-think-tank-1.3030853 |title= UK's Brexit bill likely to be well under €60bn, says think tank |newspaper=The Irish Times |date=30 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; However this £50 billion bill includes the United Kingdom's annual EU contribution (approximately £13 billion annually) for the two years from 2020 and 2021 as agreed in the [[Multiannual Financial Framework]] (MFF).{{Citation needed |date=April 2017}} The United Kingdom, in accordance with Article 50 and unless otherwise extended, will cease to be a member of the EU from 29 March 2019 and the MFF does have a provision for "unforeseen circumstances".

EU27 is expected to ask the UK to pay its liabilities in euros, including the relocation costs associated with the two EU bodies currently based in London.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2017/apr/20/eu-toughens-brexit-stance-and-demands-uk-pay-liabilities-in-euros |title=EU toughens Brexit stance and demands UK pay liabilities in euros |first=Daniel |last=Boffey |date=20 April 2017|newspaper=The Guardian}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Speaking on 20 April, Antonio Tajani said that it was too early to quantify the amount the UK would need to pay and that it was not a bill to leave the EU, it was money needed for farmers and small businesses.&lt;ref name=Sky204/&gt;

A March 2017 House of Lords report acknowledges that the EU may claim for (1) part of the current budget (which runs from 2014 to 2020) post March 2019, because it was approved by the UK (2) part of the EU future commitments which amount to €200 billion and (3) a contribution if the UK is to continue with access to some EU programmes.&lt;ref name="HoL317"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://researchbriefings.parliament.uk/ResearchBriefing/Summary/CBP-7886 |title=The UK's contribution to the EU budget |website=House of Lords |date=16 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The report concluded that the UK had no legal obligation to make "exit" payments to the EU if there was no post Brexit deal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Brexit and the EU Budget |url=https://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld201617/ldselect/ldeucom/125/125.pdf |website=House of Lords |date=4 March 2017 |accessdate=2 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="bbc.co.uk"/&gt;

Discussing financial and legal complexities involved in negotiating withdrawal, including settlement of outstanding financial liabilities and division of assets, the report mentions (paragraph 15) that the EU budget is funded by revenue drawn from various sources, governed by the EU's Own Resources Decision (ORD), which was made part of UK law by the [[European Union (Finance) Act 2015]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2015/32/pdfs/ukpgaen_20150032_en.pdf |title=European Union (Finance) Act 2015, Explanatory Notes |website=UK Government}}&lt;/ref&gt; The revenue includes contributions from import duties and [[VAT]] collected by member states. The report also mentions the EU [[Multiannual Financial Framework]] for controlling the annual expenditure.

=== Assets and liabilities ===

The EU has considerable assets including buildings, equipment and financial instruments, and there is a potential claim by the UK for a portion of these assets.&lt;ref name=IT303/&gt; [[Boris Johnson]], the UK's [[Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs|Foreign Secretary]], commenting on the Brexit "divorce bill" in May 2017 stated that the valuable EU assets the UK has paid for over the years should be properly valued, and that there were good arguments for including them in the negotiations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://news.sky.com/story/boris-johnson-says-brussels-should-pay-preposterous-brexit-bill-10875068 |title=Boris Johnson says Brussels should [not] pay 'preposterous' Brexit bill |date=13 May 2017 |website=Sky News|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=13 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Bank of England]] (BoE) has invested in the [[European Central Bank]] (ECB) amounting to 13.6743%, representing paid up capital of €55.5 billion. The BoE does not participate in any profits (or losses) of the ECB.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.ecb.europa.eu/ecb/orga/capital/html/index.en.html |title=Capital subscription |website=European Central Bank |date=1 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The BoE has also made loans to the ECB. The ECB set up the [[European Financial Stability Facility]] in 2010, which has a borrowing facility of €440bn and in addition used a guarantee from the [[European Commission]] and the [[Budget of the European Union]] as collateral to borrow a further €60bn. The UK withdrawal will affect the ECB.

The EU has a pension liability of €64 billion.&lt;ref name=HoL317/&gt;

The UK benefits from a [[UK rebate|rebate]] which reduces its contribution to the [[EU budget]]. The rebate is paid a year in arrears, accordingly the 2019 rebate would be payable in 2020.&lt;ref name=HoL317/&gt;

== UK citizens elsewhere in the EU and other EU citizens in the UK ==

Concerns have been raised by UK citizens who live in other EU countries, and by citizens from those countries who live in the UK. In May 2017, [[Michel Barnier]] stated: "Currently around 3.2 million EU citizens work and live in the UK, and 1.2 million British citizens work and live in the EU."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://europa.eu/rapid/press-release_SPEECH-17-1236_en.htm |title=Press release – Speech by Michel Barnier at the 7th State of the Union Conference, European University Institute, Florence |last= |first= |date=5 May 2017 |website=European Commission|language=en|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=7 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Issues include rights of movement, citizenship, abode, education, social support and medical treatment, and the payment of pensions; and the extent to which these rights apply to family members.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2017/may/03/may-expected-to-challenge-right-of-eu-citizens-to-bring-family-to-britain-non-european-spouses-brexit |title=May expected to challenge right of EU citizens to bring family to Britain |last=Travis |first=Alan |date=3 May 2017|newspaper=The Guardian|access-date=4 May 2017|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url= |last2=Roberts |first2=Dan|language=en-GB|issn=0261-3077}}&lt;/ref&gt; Considerations for UK citizens resident in an EU27 country include their rights to work or live in a different EU27 country.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/joint-technical-note-on-the-comparison-of-eu-uk-positions-on-citizens-rights |title=Joint technical note on the comparison of EU-UK positions on citizens' rights |website=Department for Exiting the European Union |date=20 July 2017 |language=en|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=21 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Beyond the 27 EU countries, workers have certain [[Freedom of movement for workers in the European Union|freedom of movement]] rights to/from Norway, Iceland, Liechtenstein and Switzerland.

"Associate citizenship", suggested by EU27 negotiator Guy Verhofstadt, would allow UK nationals to volunteer individually for EU citizenship, enabling them to continue to work and live on the continent. Jean-Claude Juncker, president of the European Commission, is not opposed to the idea.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.connexionfrance.com/French-news/Brexit/EU-president-not-opposed-to-associate-citizenship-plan |title=EU president 'not opposed' to associate citizenship plan |website=Connexion France |date=31 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Antonio Tajani spoke after a meeting with Theresa May on 20 April 2017, saying "the issue of reciprocal EU citizen rights should be negotiated 'immediately' with a view to getting an agreement by the end of the year."&lt;ref name=Sky204/&gt; The European Commission published a position paper on "Essential Principles on Citizens' Rights" on 12 June 2017, proposing that current and future family members of European nationals in the UK would keep their rights to settle in their residence country at any time after Britain's withdrawal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://ec.europa.eu/commission/publications/position-paper-essential-principles-citizens-rights_en |title=Position paper transmitted to the UK: essential principles on citizens' rights |last= |first= |date=12 June 2017 |website=European Commission|language=en|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=22 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Speaking in advance of publication of the paper, David Davis described the demands as "ridiculously high".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/home-news/brexit-negotiations-latest-david-davis-eu-demands-citizens-rights-ridiculously-high-european-union-a7762986.html |title=David Davis says EU demands on citizens' rights are 'ridiculously high' |last=Bulman |first=May |date=30 May 2017 |newspaper=The Independent|access-date=22 June 2017 |archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt; The UK government published their policy paper "Safeguarding the position of EU citizens in the UK and UK nationals in the EU" on 26 June.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/safeguarding-the-position-of-eu-citizens-in-the-uk-and-uk-nationals-in-the-eu |title=Safeguarding the position of EU citizens in the UK and UK nationals in the EU |last= |first= |date=26 June 2017 |website=UK Government |archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=26 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The policy paper proposed that EU citizens living in Britain will be required to apply for inclusion on a "settled status" register if they wish to remain in the country after Brexit.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2017/jun/26/eu-citizens-living-in-uk-must-apply-for-special-id-card-after-brexit |title=Brexit: EU citizens living in UK will have to join special ID register |last=Travis |first=Alan |date=26 June 2017 |newspaper=The Guardian|access-date=27 June 2017|language=en-GB|issn=0261-3077}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By the end of September 2017 progress had been made on several of the 60 points which became green, while 13 out of the 60 points remain red. Three points (points #14, #15, and #16 related to monitoring and CJEU) have to be addressed at governance level. Few points remain to be clarified (that is yellow).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://ec.europa.eu/commission/sites/beta-political/files/table_-_citizens_rights.pdf |title=Comparison of EU/UK Positions on Citizens' Rights |date=28 September 2017 |website=European Commission |access-date=30 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; On this basis European parliament will have to assess if sufficient progress has been made.

As of October 2018, UK residents in the EU have not yet had their fates decided on: On 16 October 2018, just before departing for the EU27-UK summit in Brussels, German Chancellor Angela Merkel, speaking to the German parliament, asked "How do we treat the 100,000 British citizens in Germany on the day after Brexit if there is no deal?", without supplying an answer.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://www.sueddeutsche.de/politik/merkel-regierungserklaerung-zum-brexit-1.4174193 |title=Merkels vier Minuten für den Brexit [Merkel's four minutes for Brexit] |last=Al-Serori |first=Leila |date=17 October 2018 |newspaper=Sueddeutsche Zeitung |access-date=17 October 2018|language=de|issn=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Implications ===
The general rule for losing EU citizenship is that European citizenship is lost if member state nationality is lost,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ilecproject.eu/sites/default/files/GUIDELINES%20INVOLUNTARY%20LOSS%20OF%20EUROPEAN%20CITIZENSHIP%20.pdf |title=Guidelines: Involuntary Loss of European Citizenship |date=2015 |website=European Union |access-date=30 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; but the automatic loss of EU citizenship as a result of a member state withdrawing from the EU is the subject of debate.&lt;ref name="ir.lawnet.fordham.edu"&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://ir.lawnet.fordham.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=2324&amp;context=ilj |title=The Withdrawal Clause of the Lisbon Treaty in the Light of EU Citizenship (Between Disintegration and Integration) |last=Rieder |first=Clemens M. |journal=Fordham International Law Journal |volume=37 |issue=1 |date=2013 |access-date=30 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The situation of a person acquiring EU citizenship when the UK joined the EU in 1973 compared to a person born in the UK after 1973 and was therefore born into EU citizenship, may differ. It may be necessary for the ECJ to rule on these issues.

In a 2017 decision, the ECJ ruled that the parent/s of a child with EU nationality are entitled to rights of residence, even if both non EU citizens.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.brusselstimes.com/eu-affairs/8212/non-european-parents-of-european-child-have-eu-right-of-residency |title=Non-European parents of European child have EU right of residency |newspaper=Brussels Times |date=11 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; This may have consequential effects for UK residents who have young children and wish to live in the EU27 territory post Brexit, but this remains to be tested.

=== Immigration and mobility ===

Until the UK effectively withdraws from the EU in 2019 or at another agreed date, the current system of free movement of labour between the EU27 and the UK remains in place.

The report of the House of Commons [[Exiting the European Union Select Committee|Exiting the European Union Committee]] on ''The Government's negotiating objectives'', published in April 2017,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm201617/cmselect/cmexeu/1125/112502.htm |title=3rd Report – The Government's negotiating objectives: the White Paper (HC 1125) |date=4 April 2017 |website=House of Commons |archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=4 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; proposed (paragraphs 20 and 123) that the future system for EU migration should meet the needs of different sectors of the UK economy, including those employing scientists, bankers, vets, care workers, health service professionals and seasonal agriculture workers.

[[Theresa May]], answering press questions on 5 April 2017, commented that the free movement of labour would not end in March 2019; an implementation period of possibly five years would give business and government time to adjust.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-4381026/Don-t-expect-EU-free-movement-end-five-years.html |title=Don't expect EU free movement to end for at least five years, May warns: PM says there will be an 'implementation period' after Britain leaves |newspaper=Daily Mail |date=5 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The UK currently charges an annual levy of up to £1,000 for each non-EU citizen employed within the UK.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.gov.uk/uk-visa-sponsorship-employers/immigration-skills-charge |title=UK visa sponsorship for employers: Immigration skills charge |date= |website=UK Government |language=en|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=22 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Proposals are under consideration to increase this 'immigration skills charge' to £2,000 p.a. and to implement a similar levy on EU citizens employed in the UK.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://money.cnn.com/2017/05/18/news/economy/foreign-worker-charge-theresa-may/index.html |title=Americans are going to find it much harder to get a job in Britain |website=CNN |date=18 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/brexit-latest-news-uk-employers-pay-1000-per-eu-skilled-worker-european-immigration-skills-levy-a7521626.html |title=UK employers would have to pay a £1,000-a-year fee per EU skilled worker after Brexit under new government plans |newspaper=The Independent |date=11 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to an unconfirmed newspaper report, a leaked Home Office paper has a proposal that the UK will end the free movement of labour of low-skilled workers immediately after Brexit, focusing on highly skilled EU workers instead.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2017/sep/05/leaked-document-reveals-uk-brexit-plan-to-deter-eu-immigrants |title=Leaked document reveals UK Brexit plan to deter EU immigrants |last=Hopkins |first=Nick |date=5 September 2017|newspaper=The Guardian|access-date=6 September 2017 |last2=Travis |first2=Alan|language=en-GB|issn=0261-3077}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.politico.eu/article/uk-eu-migrants-brexit-plans-to-cut-back-on-post-brexit-report/ |title=UK plans to cut back on EU migrants post Brexit: report |date=5 September 2017 |website=Politico.eu |access-date=6 September 2017|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; The proposal would limit lower-skilled EU migrants' residency permits to a maximum of two years, and the implementation of a new immigration system ending the right to settle in Britain for most European migrants while placing tough restrictions on their rights to bring over family members.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Those in "high-skilled occupations" could be given permission to work in the UK for a period of three to five years.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

==Immigration==

Immigration is one topic requiring partnership between EU and UK, as according to Theresa May, "Mass migration and terrorism are but two examples of the challenges to our shared European interests and values that we can only solve in partnership".&lt;ref name="Spectator9-17"&gt;{{cite magazine |url=https://blogs.spectator.co.uk/2017/09/theresa-mays-brexit-speech-full-text/ |title=Theresa May's Florence speech on Brexit, full text |date=22 September 2017 |magazine=[[The Spectator]] |accessdate=9 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the context of Brexit, the question of migration might contains two subtopics: on one hand migrations between EU including UK and third countries which might be dealt with at a local level; and on the other hand migration between EU and UK once UK has become a third country which was discussed for the withdrawal agreement.

==European Court of Justice (ECJ)==
The concept of [[European Court of Justice]] competence creates complications. Some pro-Brexiteers believe the Court of Justice might be completely removed from the UK landscape. Various other opinions consider that the Court of Justice or some equivalent should be able to rule on remaining issues after Brexit (for instance between a European and a British stakeholder), at least in respect of the TEU ([[Treaty on European Union]]), [[Citizenship of the European Union|European Union citizens]], or access to the [[European Single Market]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/brexit-eu-ministers-invincible-ignorance-european-court-sir-david-edward-theresa-may-a7656826.html |title='Invincible ignorance' of Theresa May's Brexit-backing ministers condemned by former judge |date=29 March 2017|newspaper=The Independent}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After the 2017 negotiations, in February 2018 the European Commission Draft Withdrawal Agreement on the withdrawal of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland from the European Union and the European Atomic Energy Community&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://ec.europa.eu/commission/sites/beta-political/files/draft_withdrawal_agreement.pdf |title=European Commission Draft Withdrawal Agreement on the withdrawal of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland from the European Union and the European Atomic Energy Community |date=28 February 2018 |website=European Commission |access-date=30 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; consider for instance that:
* "The Court of Justice of the European Union shall continue to have jurisdiction for any proceedings brought before it by the United Kingdom or against the United Kingdom before the end of the transition period. That jurisdiction shall extend to all stages of proceedings, including appeal proceedings before the Court of Justice and proceedings before the General Court after a case has been referred back to it."
* "The Court of Justice of the European Union shall continue to have jurisdiction to give preliminary rulings on requests from courts and tribunals of the United Kingdom referred to it before the end of the transition period."

==Sectoral issues==

Brexit might have impact in various sectors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/business/news/brexit-economy-sterling-currency-investment-cost-impact-business-financial-banks-insurance-retail-a7695486.html |title=Cost of Brexit: The impact on business and the economy so far |date=21 April 2017 |newspaper=The Independent}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Documents setting out how the Brexit will affect parts of the [[British economy]] were set up for the government, "the most comprehensive picture of our economy on this issue" containing "excruciating detail" according to Brexit Secretary David Davis.&lt;!--&lt;ref name=Bloomberg21dec2017&gt;--&gt; The ministers were reluctant to [[publish]] them but in November, a vote in Parliament allowed lawmakers to read them under controlled conditions to avoid [[news leak]]s.&lt;!--&lt;ref name=Bloomberg21dec2017&gt;--&gt; They were released online on 21 December 2017 but lawmakers were unimpressed: "Most of this could be found on [[Wikipedia]] or with a quick [[Google search]]," said Labour's [[David Lammy]], "these documents [were made] in a couple of weeks. They look like copy and paste essay crises."&lt;ref name=Bloomberg21dec2017&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2017-12-20/may-heads-to-poland-to-seek-brexit-ally-after-firing-her-deputy |title=May Lands in Poland to Seek Brexit Ally After Firing Deputy |first=Robert |last=Hutton |date=21 December 2017 |website=Bloomberg}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Trade ===
Without a trade agreement in place, UK trade with the EU would be governed by the World Trade Organization's [[Bali Package]]. This would lead to common tariffs and [[non-tariff barriers to trade|non-tariff barriers]] being imposed by the EU27 upon the UK's access to the [[European Single Market]], because the Market is also a [[customs union]]. However, the UK would then have an opportunity to control immigration as well as develop its own trade regulations.

The UK is not permitted to hold trade talks until after Brexit is concluded, however the UK can do preparatory work with other countries regarding the UK's future trading relationships; this is not to the liking of some EU27 countries.&lt;ref name=POL114/&gt; Before Britain leaves the EU, they may put trade agreements in place with non-EU countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite report |title=Brexit, Ireland and Northern Ireland |publisher=Constitutional Conundrums |date=2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Only the EU can act in areas where it has exclusive competence, such as the customs union and common commercial policy. In those areas Member States may not act independently.&lt;ref name="gov.uk"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/279629/bis-13-865-balance-of-competences-review-trade-and-investment.pdf |title=Review Of The Balance Of Competences Between The United Kingdom And The European Union |date=May 2013 |website=[[Department for Business, Innovation and Skills]] |access-date=30 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The UK can still negotiate its own bilateral investment protection treaties subject to Commission authorization.&lt;ref name="gov.uk"/&gt;

Strategic controls on military goods are primarily a Member State competence. As a result, Member States themselves negotiate multilateral or bilateral agreements on the strategic aspects of trade in defense goods.&lt;ref name="gov.uk"/&gt;

The EU27 wish to exclude the UK from sitting in on trade negotiations held by the EU during the period ending March 2019, seeing the UK as a competitor. Theresa May rejected this idea, saying "While we're members of the European Union we would expect our obligations but also our rights to be honored in full."&lt;ref name="POL114"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.politico.eu/article/trade-talks-for-non-british-eyes-only/ |title=Trade talks: For non-British eyes only? |website=Politico.eu |date=10 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Regional foods ====
{{see| List of United Kingdom food and drink products with protected status}}

The [[Geographical indications and traditional specialities in the European Union|Geographical indications and traditional specialties in the European Union]], known as protected designation of origin (PDO) is applied internationally via bilateral agreements. Without an agreement with the EU27, UK producers of products such as the [[Cornish Pasty|Cornish pasty]], [[Scotch whisky]] and [[Jersey Royals|Jersey Royal]] potatoes are at risk of being copied.

==== Fisheries ====

The EU27 have stated that UK fish suppliers could lose tariff-free access to the continent unless EU countries have continued access to UK waters after Brexit.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.ft.com/content/958c7e28-0f1c-11e7-b030-768954394623 |title=EU fishing fleet urges post-Brexit access to UK seas |newspaper=Financial Times |date=22 March 2017|url-access=subscription}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Agriculture'''

The Irish agricultural sector is heavily dependent on UK markets for its exports.

=== Financial services ===

==== Banks ====

Investment banks may want to have new or expanded offices up and running inside the EU27 bloc before the UK's departure in March 2019, with [[Frankfurt]] and [[Dublin]] the possible favourites.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.bloomberg.com/politics/articles/2017-03-21/what-the-biggest-banks-are-planning-as-may-sets-brexit-timing |title=What the biggest banks are planning once Brexit starts |website=Bloomberg |date=21 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ireland's investment arm, IDA Ireland, witnessed an increase in inquiries from London-based financial groups considering to open up on an office in Dublin by the end of 2016, mostly coming from North American companies. In May 2017, JP Morgan became the first major bank to officially choose Dublin to transfer some of its personnel and operations from its London office.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.the-businessreport.com/article/can-dublin-become-eus-next-finance-hub/ |title=Can Dublin become the EU's next finance hub? |website=The Business Report |date=January 2017 |accessdate=14 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Insurance ====

[[Lloyd's of London]] have confirmed that they will open a subsidiary in Brussels, hoping to ensure continuation of their continental business which generates 11% of its premiums.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-39441035 |title=Insurer Lloyd's of London confirms new Brussels subsidiary |website=BBC News |date=30 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Asset management companies ====
The situation may be different when it comes to the [[fund management]] industry, as British asset owners, notably UK [[pension fund]]s, often constitute an incommensurate share of total turnover for German, French, Dutch and other [[Continental European]] asset managers.

This imbalance could potentially give Britain some negotiating leverage e.g. power of [[retorsion]] in case the EU attempts to impose an abrupt cancellation of the mutually-binding obligations and advantages pertaining to the [[Markets in Financial Instruments Directive 2004]] (''"fund passporting"''). Research conducted by the [[World Pensions &amp; Investments Forum|World Pensions Council (WPC)]] shows that {{quote|"Assets owned by UK pension funds are more than 11 times bigger than those of all German and French pension funds put together […] If need be, at the first hint of threat to the City of London, Her Majesty's Government should be in a position to respond very forcefully."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title= Beyond Brexit: Britain, Europe and the Pension Wealth of Nations |url=https://www.academia.edu/26810948/Beyond_Brexit_Britain_Europe_and_the_Pension_Wealth_of_Nations |website=Pensions Age |date=July 2016 |page=44 |accessdate=11 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; }}

==== Stock exchanges ====
The [[London Stock Exchange]] issued a warning over a proposal by the EU, to allow euro-denominated transactions to be cleared only within the EU [[eurozone]], claiming it would increase business costs by €100bn over 5 years and isolate the euro capital market.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://news.sky.com/story/warning-to-brussels-over-stripping-city-of-euro-clearing-10888828 |title=Warning to Brussels over stripping City of euro clearing |website=Sky News |date=22 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Security ===
The letter of 29 March 2017 giving the UK's [[United Kingdom invocation of Article 50 of the Treaty on European Union|notice of intention to withdraw]] from the EU stated "In security terms a failure to reach agreement would mean our cooperation in the fight against crime and terrorism would be weakened."&lt;ref name="notificationletter" /&gt; This was seen by some as a threat.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2017/mar/29/brexit-eu-condemns-mays-blackmail-over-security-cooperation |title=Don't blackmail us over security, EU warns May |last= |first= |date=30 March 2017|newspaper=The Guardian|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=1 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 31 March, [[Boris Johnson]], the UK Foreign Secretary, confirmed that the "UK commitment to EU security is unconditional".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2017/mar/30/uk-article-50-letter-european-diplomats-threat-security-cooperation |title=Boris Johnson joins UK attempts to calm Brexit security concerns |last= |first= |date=31 March 2017|newspaper=The Guardian |archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=1 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The call by the United States to other members of [[NATO]] to increase their defence expenditure to the 2% of GDP level coincides in timing with Brexit. The UK is the second largest contributor to NATO defence, one of only five to meet the 2% level and one of only two EU members who have nuclear weapons. The possibility of a new Franco-German partnership to fill the vacuum left by Britain has been raised as a possibility and post Brexit an EU military headquarters, previously vetoed by the UK, may be created.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.france24.com/en/20170403-france-eu-nato-boost-military-defense-spending-brexit-us-warnings-isolationism |title=EU, French militaries prepare to go it alone after Brexit, US warnings |website=France24 |date=3 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The UK is fully committed to NATO.

=== Academic research ===
{{Main|Brexit and arrangements for science and technology}}
The UK government's negotiating policy when the negotiating period started on 29 March 2017 included remaining at the vanguard of science and innovation, and seeking continued close collaboration with the UK's European partners.

== British Overseas Territories and Crown dependencies ==

In the [[Great Repeal Bill 2016|Great Repeal Bill]] [[white paper]] published on 30 March 2017, the UK government stated "The Government is committed to engaging with the Crown Dependencies, Gibraltar and the other Overseas Territories as we leave the EU."&lt;ref name="GRBWP"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/604514/Great_repeal_bill_white_paper_print.pdf |title=Legislating for the United Kingdom's withdrawal from the European Union |website=Department for Exiting the European Union |date=30 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|ch.5}}

===Overseas territories===
[[Robin Walker]] [[Member of Parliament|MP]], a junior minister at the Department for Exiting the European Union, is responsible for managing the relationship between the overseas territories and Parliament in their discussion with the EU27.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.ft.com/content/225fe8b6-ed59-11e6-930f-061b01e23655?mhq5j=e1 |title=British overseas territories set out their Brexit priorities |newspaper=Financial Times |accessdate=23 June 2017|url-access=subscription}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Gibraltar ====
{{main|Gibraltar after Brexit}}

Brexit raised issues around [[sovereignty]] for [[Gibraltar#Governance|Gibraltar]], the only [[British Overseas Territories|British Overseas Territory]] in the EU.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2017/apr/02/spain-drops-plan-to-impose-veto-if-scotland-tries-to-join-eu |title=Spain drops plan to impose veto if Scotland tries to join EU |first=Jennifer |last=Rankin |date=2 April 2017|newspaper=The Guardian}}&lt;/ref&gt; Gibraltarians voted to stay in the European Union by 96%.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2017/04/01/world/europe/gibraltar-brexit-spain-britain-european-union.html |title=Spain's Desire for Gibraltar Complicates 'Brexit' Talks With E.U. |first=Stephen |last=Castle |date=1 April 2017|newspaper=The New York Times}}&lt;/ref&gt; Spain claims sovereignty over Gibraltar; however, in 2002 [[Gibraltar sovereignty referendum, 2002|Gibraltarians voted 99% to keep British sovereignty]].

The EU27 draft guidelines allow Spain a veto over any effect that the Brexit agreement has as regards Gibraltar. The guidelines state: "After the United Kingdom leaves the Union, no agreement between the EU and the United Kingdom may apply to the territory of Gibraltar without the agreement between the Kingdom of Spain and the United Kingdom."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://news.sky.com/story/brexit-guidelines-eu-hands-spain-power-over-gibraltars-future-10819502 |title= Brexit guidelines: EU hands Spain power over Gibraltar's future |website=Sky News |date=31 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Crown dependencies ===

The [[Crown dependencies]] are neither part of the EU nor of the UK. They have a unique constitutional relationship both with the UK and, as encapsulated in Protocol 3 to the UK's [[Treaty of Accession 1972|Treaty of Accession]], with the EU.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld201617/ldselect/ldeucom/136/136.pdf |title=Brexit: the Crown Dependencies |website=House of Lords |date=23 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; They have no voting rights in EU or UK referenda or elections and no international voice, the UK government having the responsibility to act for the dependencies on foreign matters. [[Oliver Heald]] [[Queen's Counsel|QC]] [[Member of Parliament|MP]] is responsible for managing the relationship between the Islands and Parliament in their discussion with the EU27.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://guernseypress.com/news/2017/04/08/protecting-finance-and-legal-sectors-a-priority-for-minister/ |title=Protecting finance and legal sectors a priority for minister |newspaper=Guernsey Press |date=8 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==The "no deal" scenario==
If no withdrawal agreement is in place on 30 March 2019 at midnight (European central time) or at 23h on 29 March (British time) (the end of the two-year period under Article 50) the EU Treaties will cease to apply to the UK.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.europarl.europa.eu/news/en/headlines/priorities/20160701TST34439/20160707STO36103/brexit-negotiations-deciding-new-eu-uk-relations |title=Brexit negotiations: deciding new EU-UK relations |date=7 July 2016 |website=European Parliament |accessdate=9 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is understood that, should there be "no deal", there will be no transition period and EU law (in particular, the Single Market) will cease to apply to the UK/EU relationship from that date.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-44887513 |title=Reality Check: The EU's 'no deal' preparations |first=Chris |last=Morris |date=19 July 2018 |website=BBC News}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the EU would prefer a Brexit with an agreed deal rather than with no deal.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; Nonetheless, even in the case of a no withdrawal deal, the Commission believes that UK and EU may soon relaunch trade negotiations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.politico.eu/article/brexit-negotiation-no-deal-european-commission-publishes-briefing-planning/ |title=European Commission publishes briefing on no-deal Brexit planning |date=19 July 2018 |website=Politico.eu}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===No deal possibility and likeliness===
A Parliamentary inquiry has concluded that "the possibility of 'no deal' is real enough to justify planning for it. The Government has produced no evidence, either to this inquiry or in its White Paper, to indicate that it is giving the possibility of 'no deal' the level of consideration that it deserves, or is contemplating any serious contingency planning. This is all the more urgent if the Government is serious in its assertion that it will walk away from a 'bad' deal."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm201617/cmselect/cmfaff/1077/107702.htm |title=House of Commons - Article 50 negotiations: Implications of 'no deal' - Foreign Affairs Committee |website=UK Parliament |accessdate=23 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The UK government has consistently said that it will aim for the "best possible deal" but that "no deal is better than a bad deal". This position was restated in the Conservative Party manifesto for the 2017 general election.&lt;ref&gt;''Conservative and Unionist Party Manifesto 2017''. 18 May 2017. pp35-36. "The negotiations will undoubtedly be tough, and there will be give and take on both sides, but we continue to believe that no deal is better than a bad deal for the UK. But we will enter the negotiations in a spirit of sincere cooperation and committed to getting the best deal for Britain."&lt;/ref&gt; In July, Michel Barnier said that "a fair deal is better than no deal", because "In the case of Brexit, 'no deal' is a return to a distant past".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2017/jul/06/frictionless-trade-impossible-if-uk-leaves-eu-single-market-says-barnier |title=Frictionless trade impossible if UK leaves EU single market, says Barnier |last=Rankin |first=Jennifer |date=6 July 2017|newspaper=The Guardian|access-date=7 July 2017|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|language=en-GB|issn=0261-3077}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the French Prime Minister [[Édouard Philippe]], "The more we think the worst should be avoided, the more we think it's not impossible it could eventually happen".&lt;ref name="nytimes.com"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2018/07/19/business/europe-brexit-contingencies.html |title=How E.U. Is Getting Ready for Chaos in a Worst-Case Brexit|newspaper=The New York Times |date=19 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

With the British (UK) white paper, both sides are wondering if the ''no deal scenario'' is more likely rather than possible.&lt;ref name="theguardian.com"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2018/jul/18/eu-assault-on-mays-white-paper-heightens-no-deal-brexit-fears |title=EU assault on May's white paper heightens 'no deal' Brexit fears |first=Daniel |last=Boffey |date=18 July 2018|newspaper=The Guardian}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===No deal adverse consequences===

A "no-deal" Brexit has been described by [[General Council of the Bar]], a lawyers' interest body, as "falling over the cliff-edge".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.barcouncil.org.uk/media-centre/publications/2017/2017/march/the-brexit-papers-second-edition/ |title=The Brexit Papers: Second Edition |website=General Council of the Bar |accessdate=23 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to the IMF, the no deal Brexit could create economic pain across Europe, with no winner.&lt;ref name="no-deal-brexit-imf"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/business/2018/jul/19/no-deal-brexit-would-harm-all-european-countries-warns-imf |title=No-deal Brexit would harm EU countries as well as UK, warns IMF |first=Richard |last=Partington |date=19 July 2018|newspaper=The Guardian}}&lt;/ref&gt; The most affected country would be UK, according to the IMF:&lt;ref name="no-deal-brexit-imf" /&gt; the IMF consider that UK and Ireland could lose 4% of their GDP, while close countries such as the Netherlands, Denmark and Belgium could lose 1% of GDP.&lt;ref name="no-deal-brexit-imf" /&gt;

In September 2017 the BBC reported that there was little evidence of UK government preparations for a "No Deal" scenario: "our government is not behaving like it is really preparing for No Deal – and the EU27 can surely see it."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Cook |first1=Chris |title=Will the government really accept 'No Deal' with the EU? |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-41271028 |website=BBC News |date=19 September 2017 |accessdate=21 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In her 4 October 2017 speech at the Conservative Party Conference, UK Prime Minister Theresa May repeated her position that "no deal is better than a bad deal" and emphasized that "It is our responsibility as a government to prepare for every eventuality. And let me reassure everyone in this hall – that is exactly what we are doing."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/brexit-theresa-may-speech-conference-no-deal-assurance-tories-a7983071.html |title=Theresa May tried to 'reassure' Tories that she is still prepared to leave EU with no Brexit deal |date=4 October 2017|newspaper=The Independent |accessdate=9 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; In her 9 October 2017 statement in the House of Commons, May warned that Britain could operate as an "independent trading nation" after Brexit if no trade deal is reached with the EU.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-41546701 |title=UK explores 'no deal' Brexit |date=9 October 2017 |website=BBC News |accessdate=9 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''no deal'' scenario has been described by [[Nick Timothy]] as leaving the EU [with Britain] in "chaos" or not leaving the bloc at all, which he says would be a "national humiliation" on a par with the [[Suez Crisis]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.belfasttelegraph.co.uk/news/republic-of-ireland/european-commission-issues-call-for-eu-states-to-get-ready-for-nodeal-brexit-37135023.html |title=European Commission issues call for EU states to get ready for no-deal Brexit |newspaper=Belfast Telegraph}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.irishexaminer.com/breakingnews/ireland/european-commission-issues-call-for-eu-states-to-get-ready-for-no-deal-brexit-856373.html |title=European Commission issues call for EU states to get ready for no-deal Brexit |date=19 July 2018|newspaper=Irish Examiner}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Martin Donnelly (civil servant)|Sir Martin Donnelly]] feels that no deal would be dangerous:&lt;ref name="independent.co.uk1"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/brexit-no-deal-sir-martin-donnelly-eu-theresa-may-government-economy-single-market-bad-deal-a8000186.html |title=Britain's former top civil servant just warned of the dangers of a 'no deal' Brexit |date=14 October 2017|newspaper=The Independent |accessdate=9 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; while no deal makes trade only dependent on World Trade Organisation terms which do not include services—80% of the British economy—he believes that no deal "could mean an awful lot of legal uncertainty and that's very bad for businesses, for jobs, for investment in Britain".&lt;ref name="independent.co.uk1"/&gt;

In the [[Scottish Centre on European Relations]] paper "Brexit Uncertainty, Scotland and the UK in 2018", a conclusion is reached that the delivery of a no deal Brexit could raise support for a second independence referendum in Scotland.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/brexit-no-deal-scottish-independence-eu-expert-kirsty-hughes-a8000871.html |title=Hard Brexit could trigger new independence referendum, says Scotland's leading EU expert |date=14 October 2017 |newspaper=The Independent |accessdate=9 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Nonetheless, according to Shadow Chancellor [[John McDonnell]] there are enough people in the House of Commons to prevent some no-agreement exit.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/no-deal-brexit-theresa-may-john-mcdonnell-labour-latest-eu-stop-commons-a8001306.html |title=Cross-party alliance 'will stop Theresa May crashing Britain out of the EU with no deal' |date=15 October 2017|newspaper=The Independent |accessdate=9 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Dominic Cummings, campaign director of [[Vote Leave]], "If there's no deal, there will be significant problems that were completely avoidable".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/home-news/vote-leave-brexit-chief-dominic-cummings-disaster-eu-european-union-theresa-may-david-davis-a8002426.html |title=The man behind Brexit says it's turning into a disaster |date=16 October 2017|newspaper=The Independent |accessdate=9 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Aviation would be particularly affected if the [[European Common Aviation Area]] and [[EU–US Open Skies Agreement]] no longer applied to the UK after a "no-deal" Brexit, since World Trade Organisation rules do not cover that sector,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Gerrard |first1=Bradley |title=With no plan B, Brexit stakes for aviation sector are sky high |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/business/2017/08/18/no-plan-b-brexit-stakes-aviation-sector-sky-high/ |newspaper=The Daily Telegraph |date=18 August 2017 |accessdate=21 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; implying that the following day a British plane could not land at an EU airport.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.francetvinfo.fr/monde/royaume-uni/legislatives-britanniques/brexit-le-resultat-des-legislatives-est-une-mauvaise-nouvelle-car-negocier-avec-un-partenaire-faible-nest-jamais-facile_2230587.html |title=Brexit : le résultat des législatives "est une mauvaise nouvelle" pour le président de la Fondation Robert-Schuman |date=10 June 2017 |website=FranceTVInfo.fr |language=fr |accessdate=23 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; UK government said in September 2018 that in case of no deal on aviation, UK would allow EU airlines to use British airports anyway, and expect EU countries to reciprocate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-britain-eu-notices-aviation-safety/uk-would-allow-eu-airlines-to-fly-in-no-deal-brexit-would-keep-eu-safety-rules-idUSKCN1M41U8|title=UK would allow EU airlines to fly in no-deal Brexit, would keep EU safety rules|access-date=18 October 2018|date=24 September 2018|website=reuters.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''no deal scenario'' could create a disruption in transport between the United Kingdom and the European Union: for instance, with delays generated by the customs, sanitary and phytosanitary controls for road transport and ports.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2018/jul/19/no-deal-brexit-eu-warns-citizens-prepare-for-worst |title=Barnier welcomes Raab by stressing urgency of Irish border deadline |first1=Daniel |last1=Boffey |first2=Jennifer |last2=Rankin |date=19 July 2018|newspaper=The Guardian}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The National Police Coordination Centre has warned that no deal would result in civil disorder at the UK's ports and borders, a "real possibility" of calling upon military assistance, a rise in crime (particularly theft and robbery) and widespread illness and disease following food and drug shortages (including NHS supplies). Police officers who are EU nationals may potentially be unable to hold a warrant card (which would leave the [[Metropolitan Police]] 750 officers short), and the ability for the police to deal with criminality from non-UK residents would be undermined as the UK "falls out of the various treaties such as the [[European arrest warrant]], [[Schengen information system]] and membership of [[Europol]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Wheeler |first1=Caroline |title=Police plan for riots and crimewave if there is no-deal Brexit |url=https://www.thetimes.co.uk/edition/news/police-plan-for-riots-and-crimewave-if-there-is-no-deal-brexit-frbbnjjqp |accessdate=9 September 2018 |newspaper=[[The Sunday Times]] |subscription=y |date=9 September 2018 |issn=0140-0460 |oclc=643156226}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Sara Thornton (police officer)|Sara Thornton]] of the [[National Police Chiefs' Council|NPCC]] said, "Existing EU tools allow us to respond quickly and intelligently to crime and terrorism in the UK and the EU – they make us better at protecting the public.

===Contingency and preparedness{{Anchor|Yellowhammer}}===

An EU document on ''Preparedness'' outlines the plans related to various issues (with or without withdrawal agreement), and another on ''Contingency'' describes measures to answer the consequences of a ''No deal''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://ec.europa.eu/info/sites/info/files/communication-preparing-withdrawal-brexit-preparedness.pdf |title=Preparing for the withdrawal of the United Kingdom from the European Union on 30 March 2019 |date=19 July 2018 |website=European Commission |access-date=30 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

To answer the consequences of a no deal Brexit, some players are involved in contingency planning and preparedness (but not panic).&lt;ref name="nytimes.com"/&gt;

To limit the consequences of a ''no deal'' scenario, some companies, such as Airbus and Rolls-Royce, are stockpiling spares.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2018/jul/19/no-deal-brexit-britain-eu-wto-march |title=Don't worry, a no-deal Brexit won't be allowed to happen |first=Simon |last=Jenkins |date=19 July 2018 |newspaper=The Guardian}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the Netherlands, around 1,000 customs officials are being recruited to manage the border with UK after the no deal Brexit.&lt;ref name="nytimes.com"/&gt;

In the UK the need for new customs agents is estimated at 5,000.&lt;ref name="nytimes.com"/&gt;

In Ireland, the need for new customs agents is estimated at 1,000.&lt;ref name="nytimes.com"/&gt;

The UK is considering converting some part of the M20 motorway into a parking lot for trucks, to manage a possible 17-mile (around 25-kilometer) line of traffic, as planned by the Dover port authority.&lt;ref name="nytimes.com"/&gt;

Dominic Raab's department is preparing public detailed plans to make the UK to deal with a no deal scenario for 29 March 2019.&lt;ref name="theguardian.com"/&gt;

The EU Commission has published 68 notices to help various players to be aware of the Brexit consequences.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

The EU Commission is also considering notifying its international partners for international agreements that involved the UK as a member state, in case of no deal.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

The UK Treasury department is using the name "[[Operation Yellowhammer]]" for no-deal contingency planning.&lt;ref name="Ind20180906"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/operation-yellowhammer-brexit-photo-eu-rail-access-nodeal-secret-paper-latest-document-a8525506.html |title=Operation Yellowhammer: Photo of secret government no-deal Brexit papers reveals questions over 'rail access to the EU |date=6 September 2018 |newspaper=The independent|url-access=limited}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==The deep and special relationship scenario==

The UK side has called for a deep and [[special relationship]] between UK and EU.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/brexit-latest-talks-downing-street-theresa-may-jean-claude-juncker-michel-barnier-eu-a7704561.html |title=Theresa May holds 'constructive' talks with EU leaders in London |date=27 April 2017|newspaper=The Independent |accessdate=10 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-britain-eu-johnson/uk-to-target-deep-partnership-with-eu-in-brexit-talks-johnson-idUSKBN19A0R4 |title=UK to target 'deep partnership' with EU in Brexit talks: Johnson |date=19 June 2017 |website=Reuters |accessdate=10 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/books/2017/apr/07/brexit-language-divorce-special-relationship-negotiation-britain-eu |title=Don't say divorce, say special relationship: the thorny language of Brexit |first=Steven |last=Poole |date=7 April 2017|newspaper=The Guardian |accessdate=10 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Possibility of an extended transitional period==
Most of the major UK political parties support the idea of a two-year period for applying temporary trade arrangements after the end of the membership of the EU single market, customs union and other EU agreements and before a stand-alone UK.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.incelaw.com/tw/knowledge-bank/the-post-brexit-transitional-period-bridge-over-troubled-negotiations |title=The post-Brexit transitional period: Bridge over troubled negotiations? |website=International Law Firm |accessdate=3 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to [[Michel Barnier]], the [[EU]] might have to define the conditions for a transitional period, if the [[UK]] requests one.&lt;ref name="europa.eu"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://europa.eu/rapid/press-release_SPEECH-17-3404_en.htm |title=Press release - Speech by Michel Barnier in front of the Committees of Foreign Affairs and the Committees of European Affairs of the Italian Parliament |date= |website=European Commission |accessdate=9 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Such a transition period would begin on 30 March 2019 (European time, as Brexit occurs at midnight the day before).&lt;ref name="europa.eu"/&gt;

According to Michel Barnier, the transition period is subject to a withdrawal agreement, by law written in [[Article 50]].&lt;ref name="europa.eu"/&gt;

==Future trade deal between UK and EU==
While negotiations between the United Kingdom and the European Union were in progress, Barnier, as the EU's chief negotiator, speaking in Rome to Committees of the Italian Parliament on 21 September 2017, stated that a future trade deal with the United Kingdom is the trade deal which will be negotiated after sufficient progress has been made on the withdrawal deal. Barnier commented that the EU will want to negotiate a future trade deal with the United Kingdom, because trade with the United Kingdom will continue.&lt;ref name="auto5"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://europa.eu/rapid/press-release_SPEECH-17-3404_en.htm |title=Speech by Michel Barnier in front of the Committees of Foreign Affairs and the Committees of European Affairs of the Italian Parliament, Rome |date=21 September 2017 |website=European Commission |access-date=30 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the same time Barnier said "the future trade deal with the United Kingdom will be particular, as it will be less about building convergence, and more about controlling future divergence. This is key to establishing fair competition."&lt;ref name="auto5"/&gt;

The United Kingdom's prime minister, in a speech at the [[Santa Maria Novella]] church in Florence on 22 September 2017,&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2017/sep/22/mays-florence-speech-venue-represents-european-unity-not-division |title=May's Florence speech venue represents European unity, not division |date=22 September 2017 |newspaper=The Guardian |access-date=30 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; proposed an economic partnership between the UK and the EU which respects both the freedoms and principles of the EU, and the wishes of the British people. At the same time she re-affirmed that after the UK leaves the EU a period of implementation would be in their mutual interest, to be agreed under Article 50 for a strictly time-limited period.&lt;ref name="Spectator9-17"/&gt;

The European parliament voted a Brexit resolution (the European Parliament resolution of 14 March 2018 on the framework of the future EU-UK relationship (2018/2573(RSP)) with 544 MEP against 110 (with 51 abstentions&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.europarl.europa.eu/unitedkingdom/en/media/news/2018/march18/association-agreement.html |title=Brexit: EP recommends association agreement for future EU-UK relations |website=European Parliament |accessdate=3 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;). The 14 page &lt;ref name="europa.eu1"/&gt; document states that an association agreement between EU and UK could be an adequate framework for the future. This resolution proposes that the agreement address four domains: trade, interior security, foreign and defense policy collaboration, and thematic cooperation (for instance for research and innovation).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine |url=https://lentreprise.lexpress.fr/actualites/1/actualites/brexit-les-eurodeputes-proposent-un-accord-d-association-au-royaume-uni_1992319.html |title=Brexit : les eurodéputés proposent un accord d'association au Royaume-Uni |date=14 March 2018|magazine=[[L'Express]] |language=fr |accessdate=3 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.europarl.europa.eu/sides/getDoc.do?type=TA&amp;reference=P8-TA-2017-0490&amp;language=EN&amp;ring=B8-2017-0677 |title=State of play of negotiations with the United Kingdom |date=13 December 2017 |website=European Parliament |accessdate=3 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The resolution also urges the UK to present a clear position on all outstanding issues pertaining to its orderly withdrawal.&lt;ref name="europa.eu1"/&gt;

On 13 November 2018, the UK and EU reached an agreement on the wording of the trade deal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.businessinsider.com/uk-european-union-thresa-may-brexit-negotiators-have-agreed-a-deal-2018-11|title=UK and EU negotiators have agreed on a Brexit deal|website=Businessinsider.com|accessdate=14 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-46188790|title=Brexit text agreed in talks breakthrough|date=14 November 2018|accessdate=14 November 2018|website=Bbc.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 14 November 2018, May's Cabinet approved the draft agreement.&lt;ref name=bbcnov14 /&gt;&lt;ref name=nov14 /&gt;&lt;ref name=nov14wapo&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/europe/theresa-may-faces-crunch-cabinet-showdown-over-her-brexit-plans/2018/11/14/124a425a-e807-11e8-a939-9469f1166f9d_story.html# |title=Archived copy |access-date=14 November 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181114174051/https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/europe/theresa-may-faces-crunch-cabinet-showdown-over-her-brexit-plans/2018/11/14/124a425a-e807-11e8-a939-9469f1166f9d_story.html# |archive-date=14 November 2018 |dead-url=yes  }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=nytnov14 /&gt; Shortly after it was approved by the British Cabinet, the European Commission published the 585 pages draft withdrawal agreement.[https://ec.europa.eu/commission/sites/beta-political/files/draft_withdrawal_agreement_0.pdf]

The '''Burgundian School''' was a group of composers active in the 15th century in what is now northern and eastern [[France]], [[Belgium]], and the [[Netherlands]], centered on the court of the [[Duchy of Burgundy|Dukes of Burgundy]].

The main names associated with this school are [[Guillaume Dufay]], [[Gilles Binchois]], [[Antoine Busnois]] and (as an influence), the English composer [[John Dunstaple]]. The Burgundian School was the first phase of activity of the [[Franco-Flemish School]], the central musical practice of the [[Renaissance music|Renaissance]] in Europe.

==Background==

In late [[Medieval]] and early [[Renaissance]] Europe, cultural centers tended to move from one place to another due to changing political stability and the presence of either the spiritual or temporal power, for instance the [[Pope]], [[Anti-pope]] or the [[Holy Roman Emperor]].  In the 14th century, the main centers of musical activity were northern [[France]], [[Avignon]], and [[Italy]], as represented by [[Guillaume de Machaut]] and the ''[[ars nova]]'', the ''[[ars subtilior]]'', and [[Francesco Landini|Landini]] respectively; Avignon had a brief but important cultural flowering because it was the location of the Papacy during the [[Western Schism]].  When France was ravaged by the [[Hundred Years' War]] (1337–1453), the cultural center migrated farther east, to towns in Burgundy and the [[Low Countries]], known then collectively as the [[Netherlands]].&lt;ref name="Wright, Grove"&gt;Wright, Grove&lt;/ref&gt;

During the reign of the [[House of Valois]], Burgundy was the most powerful and stable political division in western Europe, and added, a bit at a time, [[Flanders]], [[Brabant (province)|Brabant]], [[Holland]], [[Luxembourg]], [[Alsace]] and [[Lorraine (province)|Lorraine]]. Especially during the reigns of [[Philip the Good]] (1419 &amp;ndash; 1467) and [[Charles the Bold]] (1467 &amp;ndash; 1477), this entire area, loosely known as Burgundy, was a center of musical creativity.  Most of the musical activity did not take place in what is modern-day Burgundy, which has its capital in [[Dijon]] (even though the Dukes of Burgundy maintained an administrative center there).  The main centers of music-making were [[Brussels]], [[Bruges]], [[Lille]], and [[Arras]], as well as smaller towns in that same general area.&lt;ref name="Wright, Grove"/&gt;

Musicians from the region came to Burgundy to study and further their own careers as the reputation of the area spread. The Burgundian rulers were not merely patrons of the arts, but took an active part:  Charles the Bold himself played the [[harp]], and composed [[chanson]]s and [[motet]]s (although none have survived with reliable attribution).  The worldly dukes also encouraged the composition of secular music to a degree seen only rarely before in European music history, a characteristic which itself defines the Burgundian epoch as a Renaissance phenomenon.&lt;ref&gt;Reese, p. 4-8&lt;/ref&gt;

This migration of musical culture east from Paris to Burgundy also corresponds with the conventional (and by no means universally accepted) division of music history into [[Medieval music|Medieval]] and [[Renaissance music|Renaissance]]; while [[Guillaume de Machaut]] is often considered to be one of the last Medieval composers, Dufay is often considered to be the first significant Renaissance composer.

Charles the Bold was killed in 1477 in the [[Battle of Nancy]], during one of his attempts to add territory to his empire. After his death, music continued to flourish as before, but the region was split politically, with the duchy of Burgundy being absorbed into France, and most of the Low Countries becoming part of the holdings of the [[Spain|Spanish]] [[Habsburgs]].  Both the French court and the Habsburgs were patrons of music; however a French style began to diverge from that of the Low Countries, especially in secular music, and in the period after 1500.

==Composers==

The history of Burgundian music began with the organization of the chapel in 1384; twenty years later, it rivaled the famous establishment at Avignon in splendor.  Names associated with this early phase of Burgundian music include [[Johannes Tapissier]] and [[Nicolas Grenon]], who carried the tradition across to the next phase of the chapel, when it was reorganized in 1415.  Other early composers there were [[Hugo de Lantins|Hugo]] and [[Arnold de Lantins]], both of whom Dufay later met in Italy.

Of all the names associated with the Burgundian School, the most famous was [[Guillaume Dufay]], who was probably the most famous composer in Europe in the 15th century.  He wrote music in many of the forms which were current, music which was melodic, singable and memorable (more than half of his sacred music consists of simple harmonizations of [[plainsong]], for example).  Contemporary with Dufay were composers such as [[Gilles Binchois]], who was at the Burgundian court between approximately 1430 and 1460, and [[Hayne van Ghizeghem]], a composer, singer and soldier who may have been killed in the last military campaign of Charles the Bold.

After the death of Dufay in 1474, the most prominent Burgundian musician was [[Antoine Busnois]], who was also a prolific composer of chansons, and who possibly wrote the famous [[L'homme armé]] tune.

==Musical style and forms==
[[File:Burgundian cadence on D.png|thumb|[[Burgundian cadence]] on D; note the parallel fourths between upper voices.&lt;ref&gt;White, John D. (1976). ''The Analysis of Music'', p.129-130. {{ISBN|0-13-033233-X}}.&lt;/ref&gt; {{audio|Burgundian cadence on D.mid|Play}}]]

Burgundian composers favored secular forms, at least while they worked in Burgundian lands; much sacred music survives, especially from those composers who spent time in Italy, for example in the papal choir.  The most prominent secular forms used by the Burgundians were the four ''[[formes fixes]]'' ([[Rondeau (forme fixe)|rondeau]], [[ballade (forme fixe)|ballade]], [[virelai]], and [[bergerette]]), all generically known as [[chanson]]s.  Of the four, the rondeau was by far the most popular; at any rate more rondeaux have survived than any other form.  Most of the rondeaux were in three voices, and in French, though there are a few in other languages.  In most of the rondeaux, the uppermost voice (the "superius") was texted, and the other voices were most likely played by instruments.  The bergerette was developed by the Burgundians themselves; it was like a virelai, but shorter, having only one stanza.

Most of the composers also wrote sacred music in Latin; this was to remain true for the next several generations.  They wrote both [[mass]]es and [[motet]]s, as well as cycles of [[Magnificat]]s.  During the period, the mass transformed from a group of individual sections written by different composers, often using a [[head-motif]] technique, to unified cycles based on a [[cantus firmus]].  Dufay, Binchois, Busnois, [[Reginald Liebert]] and others all wrote cyclic masses.  One of the favorite tunes used as a cantus firmus was the renowned [[l'homme armé]], which was set not only by the Burgundians but by composers of subsequent centuries; indeed it was commonest tune used as a basis for mass composition in all of music history, with more than forty surviving masses featuring the melody.  David Fallows writes of it in the [[New Grove]]:  "It is hard to think of any other melody in the history of music that has yielded so much music of the highest quality."&lt;ref&gt;David Fallows. "L'homme armé." In Grove Music Online. Oxford Music Online, http://www.oxfordmusiconline.com/subscriber/article/grove/music/16553 (accessed July 22, 2010).&lt;/ref&gt;

During the period the motet transformed from the [[isorhythm]]ic model of the 14th century to the smoothly [[polyphony|polyphonic]], sectional composition seen in the work of the later Burgundians such as Busnois.  In the motets, as well as the masses and other sacred music, a common musical technique employed was [[fauxbourdon]], a harmonization of an existing chant in parallel 6-3 chords, occasionally ornamented to prevent monotony.  Composition using fauxbourdon allowed sung text to be clearly understood, but yet avoided the plainness of simple chant. Burgundian motets tended to be in Latin, written for three voices with the top voice being the most important. An example of a Burgundian motet is ''Quam pulchra es'', written by Dunstaple in the early 15th century.

Instrumental music was also cultivated at the Burgundian courts, often for dancing.  A peculiarity of the Burgundian instrumental style is that the dukes preferred music for loud instruments ([[trumpet]]s, [[tambourin]]s, [[shawm]]s, [[bagpipe]]s) and more of this survives than for other current instruments such as the lute or the harp.  In contemporary practice, the loud instruments would usually play from an elevated location, such as a balcony, while the other instruments would play closer to the dancers.&lt;ref name="Wright, Grove"/&gt;

Instrumental forms included the ''[[basse danse]]'', or ''bassadanza'', which was a ceremonial dance of a rather dignified character, and relatively slow tempo.  Typically it was in a duple meter subdivided into threes (in modern notation, 6/8), and often the dance would be immediately followed by a quick dance, the ''[[tordion]]'' or ''pas de Brabant''.&lt;ref&gt;Gleason, p. 101-102.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Burgundian School was the first generation of what is sometimes known as the [[Dutch School (music)|Netherlands School]], several generations of composers spanning 150 years who composed in the [[polyphony|polyphonic]] style associated with the mainstream of Renaissance practice.  Later generations, which were no longer specifically associated with either the court or the region Burgundy but were interlinked by adjacent geography and by common musical practice, included such names as [[Johannes Ockeghem]], [[Jacob Obrecht]], [[Josquin des Prez]], [[Adrian Willaert]] and [[Orlandus Lassus]].

==Manuscript sources==

There are approximately 65 manuscript sources which contain music by Burgundian composers.  The most prominent of these include:

* [[Canonici Manuscript]] (containing music from around 1400 to 1440).  This manuscript is at the [[Bodleian Library]] in [[Oxford, England]]; it is named after a previous owner, Matteo Luigi Canonici, an 18th-century Venetian Jesuit.  It has 380 compositions in all, including works by 60 composers.  Both sacred and secular music are well represented in this collection.
* [[Laborde Chansonnier]] (containing music mainly composed during the reign of Charles the Bold, 1467&amp;ndash;1477).  It is named after the Marquis de Laborde, and is presently at the [[Library of Congress]] in Washington, DC.  It has 106 pieces of music in all.
* [[Mellon Chansonnier]] (containing music from approximately 1440 to 1477).  It is named after [[Paul Mellon]], who gave it to [[Yale University]]; currently it is in the Beinecke Library there.  It has 57 compositions, and includes some non-Burgundian music as well (for example, works by contemporary English and Italian composers)
* [[Dijon Chansonnier]] (containing music from approximately 1470 to 1475).  Some of the music is by composers not normally associated with the Burgundian school, such as Ockeghem, [[Loyset Compère]], and [[Johannes Tinctoris]].  It is at the public library in Dijon, and contains 161 pieces of music in all.
* [[El Escorial Chansonnier]] (containing music from about 1430 to 1445).  It is in the Biblioteca del Monasterio, [[El Escorial]], V.III.24, and is commonly referred to as EscA.  It contains a total of 62 compositions, only one of which is attributed (to [[Gilles Binchois]]), although many of the rest have been assigned to Binchois, Dunstaple, Dufay, and others, on stylistic grounds.&lt;ref&gt;Gleason, 95-96&lt;/ref&gt;

In its statement, pharmaceutical company [[Sanofi Pasteur]] reported concerns that [[Filipinos]], mostly schoolchildren, could be potentially be at risk of a more severe disease, where the recipient of the vaccine had not had a previous [[Dengue fever|dengue]] infection. On December 4, 2017, Sanofi denied that they made Filipinos into “[[Guinea pig|guinea pigs]]”, explaining that the vaccine program was conducted by the DOH, not Sanofi.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| title=Sanofi, DOH allay dengue vaccine fears |url=http://www.philstar.com/headlines/2017/12/04/1765198/sanofi-doh-allay-dengue-vaccine-fears |work=[[The Philippine Star]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Sanofi denies Pinoys became ‘guinea pigs,’ says no reported Dengvaxia deaths in PH |url=http://www.interaksyon.com/sanofi-denies-filipinos-became-dengvaxia-guinea-pigs-explains-severe-dengue-allays-fears/ |work=[[News5]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dr Ruby Dizon, a medical director of Sanofi, said that the dengue vaccination would not cause "severe dengue".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Ex-DOH chief ready to face probe over Dengvaxia mess|url=http://news.abs-cbn.com/news/12/05/17/ex-doh-chief-ready-to-face-probe-over-dengvaxia-mess|work=ABS-CBN News}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Senate of the Philippines|Senator]] [[JV Ejercito]], chair of the Senate Committee on Health and Demography, is seeking to identify by January 2018 whether there was an irregularity in the procurement of the vaccine.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Senate to probe dengue vaccine in January|url=http://www.philstar.com/headlines/2017/12/02/1764274/senate-probe-dengue-vaccine-january|work=[[The Philippine Star]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Senator [[Risa Hontiveros]] urged the government to address the health threats posed by the vaccine.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Risa says Sanofi must pay over Dengvaxia mess; DOJ orders probe of PNoy gov’t’s P3.5-B vaccination drive|url=http://www.interaksyon.com/risa-urges-govt-to-create-database-of-children-given-dengvaxia-says-sanofi-must-shoulder-needs-of-affected-pinoys/|work=[[News5]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Food and Drug Administration (Philippines)|Food and Drug Administration of the Philippines]] ordered Sanofi to stop distributing of Dengvaxia into the country.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=PH gov’t orders Sanofi to stop sale, distribution of Dengvaxia|url=http://www.interaksyon.com/ph-govt-orders-sanofi-to-stop-sale-distribution-of-dengvaxia/|work=[[News5]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20171205044730/http://www.fda.gov.ph/advisories-2/476894-fda-advisory-no-2017-318-suspension-of-sale-marketing-distribution-of-sanofi-pasteur-inc-s-tetravalent-vaccine-live-attenuated-dengvaxia "FDA Advisory No. 2017-318 || Suspension of Sale/Marketing/Distribution of Sanofi Pasteur, Inc.’s Tetravalent Vaccine (Live, Attenuated)(Dengvaxia)"].

=== Gordon's draft report ===
On April 11, Gordon released his draft report, stating that Aquino is guilty of "malfeasance, misfeasance and nonfeasance" in connection to that controversy.&lt;ref name="Senate027-09"&gt;{{cite news|title=Senate blue ribbon on Dengvaxia mess: Aquino simply did not care|url=https://www.philstar.com/headlines/2018/04/11/1804941/senate-blue-ribbon-dengvaxia-mess-aquino-simply-did-not-care|work=[[The Philippine Star]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; The blue ribbon committee also told Aquino for "simply not caring" because the lives of Filipino children in grave danger.&lt;ref name="Senate027-09"/&gt; Gordon said that Aquino, former Budget Secretary Florencio Abad, Garin and other conspirators must be prosecuted for the Dengvaxia mess.&lt;ref name="Senate027-09"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Aquino, Abad, Garin ‘caused’ Dengvaxia ‘tragedy’ – draft report|url=http://newsinfo.inquirer.net/981645/news-senate-blue-ribbon-committee-dengvaxia-benigno-aquino-iii-florencio-abad-janette-garin-sanofi|work=[[Philippine Daily Inquirer]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Gordon slammed Aquino by saying that "he's insensitive and lacks compassion."&lt;ref&gt;''"Former President Aquino is responsible because he caused the purchase of Dengvaxia and in the process caused irreversible damage, possibly death, to children, [and] anxiety, sleepless nights, unnecessary expense on the part of the parents and guardians.

==Casualties==
Since the announcement by Sanofi, at least 65 children have died {{as of|2018|7|pre=early|lc=y}}, allegedly after receiving a vaccination.

The '''Design Automation Conference''', or '''DAC''', is an annual event, a combination of a technical conference and a trade show, both specializing in [[electronic design automation]] (EDA). 
 
DAC is the oldest and largest conference in EDA, started in 1964. It grew out of the SHARE ("Society to Help Avoid Redundant Effort") design automation workshop. Its originators Marie Pistilli and Pasquale (Pat) Pistilli were honored by the EDA community. Pat received the highest honor in EDA industry, the [[Phil Kaufman Award]], for this effort&lt;ref&gt;[http://dsp-fpga.com/articles/looking-back-at-the-milestones-as-dac-50-approaches/ "Looking back at the milestones as DAC-50 approaches"], Mike Demler, March 19, 2013 (retrieved April 4, 2013)&lt;/ref&gt; and Marie was honored by having an award established in her name, Marie R. Pistilli Women in EDA Achievement Award,&lt;ref&gt;[https://dac.com/content/women-electronic-design "Women in Electronic Design"]&lt;/ref&gt; known as the Marie R. Pistilli Women in Engineering Achievement Award since 2016.&lt;ref&gt;[https://dac.com/sites/default/files/files/2016/53dac_wwed_nomination.pdf "2016 Marie R. Pistilli Women in Engineering Achievement Award Nominations"] (retrieved February 29, 2016)&lt;/ref&gt;

Up until the mid-'70s, DAC had sessions on all types of design automation, including mechanical and architectural.  After that, for all intents and purposes, only topics concerned with electronic design have been included. Also until the mid-'70s, DAC was strictly a technical conference. Then a few companies started to request space to show their products, and within a few years the trade show portion of DAC became the main focus of the event. The first commercial DAC was held in June 1984. As a rough metric of the importance of the trade show portion, about 5,500 people attended DAC in 2005, whereas ICCAD, at least as strong technically but with no trade show, drew perhaps a tenth as many attendees.

Other similar conferences are the [[International Conference on Computer-Aided Design]], or ICCAD (technical only, no trade show), [[Design Automation and Test in Europe]] (DATE), [[Asia and South Pacific Design Automation Conference]] (ASPDAC), and International Symposium on Quality Electronic Design (ISQED).

Over the past few years the conference location has been alternating among [[San Diego]], [[Austin]], [[Anaheim]], and [[San Francisco]].  The conference is usually held in June.

DAC is sponsored by several professional societies: ACM-SIGDA ([[Association for Computing Machinery]], [[Special Interest Group on Design Automation]]), ESD Alliance(Electronic System Design Alliance), and IEEE-CEDA ([[Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers]], [[IEEE Council on Electronic Design Automation]]), in technical cooperation with IEEE-SSCS ([[IEEE Solid-State Circuits Society]]). DAC is organized by hundreds of volunteer committee members from EDA companies and academia.&lt;ref&gt;http://www2.dac.com/committees.aspx.&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Eastern Idaho State Fair''' is an [[United States|American]] [[state fair]] held annually the first week of September in [[Blackfoot, Idaho]]. It is one of two annual state fairs in Idaho; the other is the [[Western Idaho Fair]], which is held in [[Boise, Idaho|Boise]], the state capital. The gates to the fairgrounds open on [[Labor Day]] weekend, the first week in September.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cityofblackfoot.org/images/PDF%20Files/CityOfBlackfootHistory.pdf|title=History of Blackfoot|date=August 14, 2014|publisher=City of Blackfoot, Idaho|accessdate=September 4, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.u-s-history.com/pages/h2583.html|title=History of Blackfoot, Idaho|date=September 4, 2015|publisher=Online Highways LLC|accessdate=September 4, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
In 1902 some cattle ranchers had purchased some land in hopes of putting on a [[livestock show]]. The show was given the name "Southeastern Idaho Fair".&lt;ref name="Fair"&gt;{{cite web|title=Fair History|url=http://www.funatthefair.com/about/fair-history/|publisher=IE Productions|date=September 4, 2015|accessdate=September 4, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When financial hardships hit the fair in 1918, it was suspended until 1920. The [[Idaho Legislature|state legislators]] passed a Fair District Bill in 1925. The fair started out as a district fair with livestock and entertainment.  After being challenged by the [[Utah State Fair]], the officials decided to change the name of the event from "Eastern Idaho Fair" to "Eastern Idaho State Fair".&lt;ref name="Fair"/&gt; In 1925, the fair ran for four days.

The fair was shut down in July 1942, after the United States entered [[World War II]], and the buildings at the fairground were used for storage of surplus. On December 10, a fire destroyed the commercial buildings consuming [[potatoes]] and [[coal]].&lt;ref name="Fair"/&gt; In 1942, the Fair housed some 500 Italian prisoners, who were ordered to dig [[sugar beets]] and potatoes.&lt;ref name="Fair" /&gt; Operations have continued since 1944.&lt;ref name="Fair" /&gt;The [[Native Americans in the United States|Native Americans]] of [[Fort Hall, Idaho|Fort Hall]] have also influenced the Eastern Idaho State Fair: an Indian Relay Race has been held throughout the fair's history.&lt;ref name="Fair" /&gt;The state fair has been used to promote local [[agriculture]] throughout its history, with area farmers displaying their [[produce]] and livestock to the public.&lt;ref name="Fair" /&gt;

2017 marked the 115 year anniversary for the fair. It set an attendance record of 239,103 which broke the previous record set in 2016.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://idahostatejournal.com/news/local/eastern-idaho-state-fair-sets-new-attendance-record/article_8b6e410f-9ccf-5329-acf8-fec22ebe76ff.html|title=2017 Eastern Idaho State Fair sets new attendance record|last=release|first=Eastern Idaho State Fair press|work=Idaho State Journal|access-date=2018-08-30|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Opening day==
One of the events held at the opening of the fair is the annual [[parade]] held in Blackfoot.{{citation needed|date=September 2015}} The parade starts at the south end of Shilling Avenue and makes its way to the north end. Several local clubs and organizations, as well as representatives from local high schools, police department, fire department, businesses and dance teams, participate in the line of the parade. The parade is escorted by the local police department and fire department, sounding their horns and sirens. Local high schools, [[cheerleading]] squads, [[student council]], Junior Miss winners, dance team and some clubs have their own [[Float (parade)|floats]]. The people on these floats cheer, throw candy, and promote the fair. Businesses around town are in the parade with music, candy, and brochures advertising their business. The dance teams advertise their team, but and entertain the crowd by doing a dance while walking down the road.

==Attractions==
Chinese, Japanese, Mexican, American, and Indian food is sold at the fair, including [[teriyaki]] bowls, [[Fried dough|tiger ears]], [[scone]] nuggets, [[turkey (bird)|turkey legs]], [[hamburger]]s, [[funnel cake]]s, [[curly fries]], [[ice cream]], and [[Dutch oven]] cooking.

Weekdays at the [[grandstand]]s, [[horse races]] are held from noon until about late afternoon.

After every few heats, the Indian relays are held. The Native American tribes have three horses each, which are taken for three laps around the track. In order to use every horse each tribe has to do a switch after taking one lap, and the man on the horse does not wait until the horse is at a dead halt. The participants in the race jump off the horse while horse is slowing down, then run and jump onto the next horse. Those who fail to jump correctly get far behind the other teams.  The horses from which they jump are sometimes unable to slow down in time, and trample the rider.{{citation needed|date=January 2015}}  Many people participate in [[gambling]] on the race.{{citation needed|date=January 2015}}

Night time events include [[motocross]], [[bull riding]], [[rodeo]], tractor pulls, [[concerts]], and a [[demolition derby]].&lt;ref&gt;# [https://web.archive.org/web/20080409071536/http://www.idaho-state-fair.com/headline.php Headliners.] Eastern Idaho State Fair. IE Productions. 20 Feb 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; The concerts change every year, with different genres and performers. The 2015 edition of the fair features [[Gabriel Iglesias]] and [[Cheap Trick]] as headline performers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Journal Staff|title=Gabriel Iglesias, Cheap Trick to perform at Eastern Idaho State Fair|url=http://www.idahostatejournal.com/news/local/gabriel-iglesias-cheap-trick-to-perform-at-eastern-idaho-state/article_4fb844cc-0a41-11e5-b707-2b73ce249906.html|publisher=''[[Idaho State Journal]]''|date=June 3, 2015|accessdate=September 4, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Eastern Idaho State Fair Announces New Themes, Big Acts|url=http://www.kpvi.com/mostpopular/story/Eastern-Idaho-State-Fair-Announces-New-Themes-Big/7XgUWZIYtkuJ7yjrFM_Jfg.cspx|publisher=[[KPVI-DT|KPVI News 6]]|date=June 3, 2015|accessdate=September 4, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On two other small stages, smaller events take place. Some of the smaller events include [[hypnotist]]s, [[arm wrestling]] contests, "[[American Idol|Idaho Idol]]" (sponsored by [[KFTZ|KFTZ "Z-103.FM"]]), local dance teams, singing, and comedy shows. Other events surrounding the stage include a [[petting zoo]], camp trailers, and a reptile show.

Fairground rides and games are operated at the show, including child rides and adult rides, including the Zipper, Fun Slide, House of Mirrors, and trucks that go around on a track. Tickets and wristbands are sold to the rides and the games. The rides are provided by [[Butler Amusements]].

Animals displayed at the fair include dairy and [[beef cattle]], different types and breeds of horses, [[sheep]], [[pig]]s, [[goat]]s, [[chicken]], [[rabbit]]s, and [[ostrich]]es.&lt;ref name=Fair/&gt; The public is allowed to showcase their livestock for the [[4H]] program.

Buildings on the fairgrounds include agricultural information, advertising of [[hot tub]]s, trailers, fireplaces, siding for houses, and others. The smaller buildings may contain craft items. Blankets, handmade clothes, and other stitching work is displayed, along with photography of animals, nature, children, weddings, families, senior pictures, and other subjects.

The '''FIA GT1 World Championship''' was a [[world championship]] [[sports car racing]] series developed by the [[Stéphane Ratel Organisation|SRO Group]] and regulated by the [[Fédération Internationale de l'Automobile]] (FIA), held from 2010 to 2012. It featured multiple [[grand tourer]] race cars based on production road cars and conforming with the GT1 (2010–2011) and GT3 (2012) regulations competing in one-hour races on multiple continents. All cars were performance balanced with weight and restrictor adjustments to artificially equalise their performance. Championships were awarded each season for drivers and teams.

The FIA GT1 World Championship started in [[2010 FIA GT1 World Championship|2010]] as a successor to the [[FIA GT Championship]] which had featured the GT1 category as well as a GT2 category. In 2012 the series originally planned to move away from exclusive use of GT1 cars by allowing 2009-spec GT2 from the former FIA GT Championship as well as current performance balanced [[FIA GT3 European Championship|GT3]] specification cars to compete alongside the series' current GT1 cars. However, as there were no interested GT2 teams and only a handful of former GT1 runners were willing to participate, the SRO decided that the 2012 season would be contested with GT3-spec cars only (yet retaining GT1 in the series' title). The series folded after the 2012 season due to the high costs, shrinking car counts and issues with the calendar, and morphed into the [[FIA GT Series]] for 2013.

==Format==
The FIA GT1 World Championship held races in ten countries, with each event consisting of two races over a weekend. Qualifying involved a knock-out system similar to [[Formula One]], in which three sessions were held and following each session, the slowest cars were eliminated and their grid positions set. The first race of each weekend was a qualifying race, the results of which determined the starting grid for a second race awarding full championship points.  Each car was required to change tires and drivers at least once during each race.&lt;ref name="EI"&gt;{{Cite web | url = http://www.endurance-info.com/version2/actualite-endurance-774.html | title = Test Days: Tout sur le Championnat du Monde GT1 2010 ! | publisher = Endurance-Info.com | language = French | date = 2009-04-06 | accessdate = 2009-04-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; The points system for the series was identical to that adopted by the FIA in 2010 with the top ten finishers in the second race earning points; only the top three finishers in the qualifying race earned points.&lt;ref name="GT1 points"&gt;{{Cite web | url = http://www.gt1world.com/news/article/gt1-first-to-test-new-silverstone-track | title = GT1 adopts F1 points system | publisher = [[Stephane Ratel Organisation|SRO Group]] | work = FIA GT1 World Championship | date = 2010-03-15 | accessdate = 2010-03-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The series penalized cars which won races with [[Ballast weight]], but that practice was removed for 2012. With rules changes in 2012, there were no limit to the number of manufacturers in the series. Each manufacturer could only be represented by one team, and each team was required to bring two identical cars to enter the championship; single entries or entries with more than two cars were not allowed. To ensure close competition, each model of car was tested by the FIA to determine any mandatory adjustments (such as extra weight ballasts and restrictor tweaks) for performance balancing.&lt;ref name="EI" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=F.A.Q. |publisher=[[FIA GT Championship]] |url=http://www.fiagt.com/faq.php |accessdate=2009-07-02 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090524212904/http://www.fiagt.com/faq.php |archivedate=2009-05-24 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Performance adjustments were also made between races during the season.

To defray costs for individual teams, the SRO provided free transport for cars and equipment as well as airline tickets for ten personnel per team.&lt;ref name="EI" /&gt;

==Races==
The world tour visited three continents: Europe, Asia and South America. [[Yas Marina Circuit]] of the [[United Arab Emirates]] represented the series' only Middle East round. South America featured the [[Potrero de los Funes Circuit]] in [[Argentina]] and [[Autódromo José Carlos Pace|Interlagos]] in [[Brazil]]. European races included the [[Czech Republic|Czech]] [[Masaryk Circuit|Brno Circuit]], [[Great Britain|British]] [[Silverstone Circuit]] where the winners were awarded the [[RAC Tourist Trophy]], [[France|French]] [[Circuit Paul Ricard|Paul Ricard]], [[Portugal|Portuguese]] [[Autódromo Internacional do Algarve]], and [[Spain|Spanish]] [[Circuito de Navarra]]. [[Germany]]'s races switched from the [[Nürburgring]] to the [[Sachsenring]] from 2010 to 2011, while [[Belgium]]'s races moved from the [[Circuit de Spa-Francorchamps]] to [[Circuit Zolder|Zolder]]. For 2011 the series visited Asia with a [[China|Chinese]] round at the [[Ordos International Circuit]]. Due to the cancellation of the round at Curitiba in 2011, the series elected to visit [[Goldenport Park Circuit]] at [[Beijing]] shortly after the round at Ordos, with a short exhibition street race afterwards.

== History ==
{{for|information on the earlier series|FIA GT Championship}}
Six manufacturers were represented in the inaugural season of FIA GT1, with [[Corvette Racing|Chevrolet]], [[Maserati]], and [[Aston Martin]] retaining the grandfathered [[Chevrolet Corvette C6.R|Corvette C6. R]], [[Maserati MC12|MC12]], and [[Aston Martin DBR9|DBR9]] cars they had respectively utilized in the FIA GT series. [[Ford Motor Company|Ford]], [[Nissan Motors|Nissan]], and [[Lamborghini]] all brought new or modified vehicles developed specifically for FIA GT1; the [[Ford GT1]], [[Nissan GT-R]], and [[Lamborghini Murciélago R-GT]].

The champions of the 2010 season were crowned at the [[Potrero de los Funes Circuit|San Luis street circuit]] in Argentina after the Qualifying Race on 5 December 2010. [[Michael Bartels]] and [[Andrea Bertolini]], three-time FIA GT Champions, clinched the Drivers' Championship while their [[Vitaphone Racing Team]] clinched the Teams' Championship. [[Aston Martin]] earned the SRO Trophy for Manufacturers. In 2011 the defending champions did not return and Maserati was no longer represented, leaving a field of 18 cars from five manufacturers. The series visited China for the first time for two rounds. Germans [[Michael Krumm]] and [[Lucas Luhr]] of the [[Sumo Power|JR Motorsports]] team won the year's Drivers' Championship in the penultimate race of the season, while [[Hexis AMR]] (Aston Martin) won the Teams' title in the final race of the year.

'''Factitious disorder imposed on another''' ('''FDIA''' or '''FDIoA'''), also known as '''Munchausen syndrome by proxy''' ('''MSbP'''), is a condition derived from [[Munchausen syndrome]], a [[psychiatric disorder|psychiatric]] [[factitious disorder]] wherein those affected feign [[disease]], illness, or [[psychological trauma]] to draw attention, sympathy, or reassurance to themselves. However, unlike  Munchausen syndrome, in MSbP, the deception involves not themselves, but rather someone under the person's care. MSbP is primarily distinguished from other forms of abuse or neglect by the motives of the perpetrator. Some experts consider it to be an elusive, potentially lethal, and frequently misunderstood form of [[child abuse]]&lt;ref name="pmid15578197"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Vennemann B, Bajanowski T, Karger B, Pfeiffer H, Köhler H, Brinkmann B |title=Suffocation and poisoning: The hard-hitting side of Munchausen syndrome by proxy |journal=[[International Journal of Legal Medicine]] |publisher=[[Taylor &amp; Francis]]|location=London, England|volume=119 |issue=2 |pages=98–102 |date=March 2005 |pmid=15578197 |doi=10.1007/s00414-004-0496-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; or medical [[neglect]].&lt;ref name="Stirling"&gt;{{cite journal |author=Stirling J |title=Beyond Munchausen syndrome by proxy: identification and treatment of child abuse in a medical setting |journal=[[Pediatrics (journal)|Pediatrics]] |publisher=[[Karger Publishers]]|location=Berlin, Germany|volume=119 |issue=5 |pages=1026–30 |date=May 2007 |pmid=17473106 |doi=10.1542/peds.2007-0563 |url=http://pediatrics.aappublications.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&amp;pmid=17473106 |author2=American Academy of Pediatrics Committee on Child Abuse Neglect}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, others consider the concept to be problematic, since it is based largely on supposition regarding a person's motives, which can be open to radically different interpretations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Lilienfeld|first1=Scott O|last2=Lynn|first2=Steven Jay|last3=Lohr|first3=Jeffrey M|title=Science and pseudoscience in clinical psychology|date=2014|publisher=Guilford|location=[S.l.]|isbn=9781462517510}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Mart|first1=Eric G.|title=Munchausen's syndrome by proxy reconsidered|date=2002|publisher=N.H.|location=Manchester|isbn=978-0970960009|edition=1st}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Factitious disorder imposed on another has also spawned much heated controversy within the legal and social services communities. In a handful of high-profile cases, mothers who have had several children die from [[sudden infant death syndrome]] have been declared to have MSbP. Based on MSbP testimony of an [[expert witness]], they were tried for murder, convicted, and imprisoned for several years. In some cases, that testimony was later [[witness impeachment|impeached]], resulting in [[exoneration]] of those defendants.&lt;ref name="bbc-mothers" /&gt;

==Signs and symptoms==
In factitious disorder imposed on another, a caregiver makes a dependent person appear mentally or physically ill in order to gain attention. To perpetuate the medical relationship, the caregiver systematically misrepresents symptoms, fabricates signs, manipulates laboratory tests, or even purposely harms the dependent (e.g. by poisoning, suffocation, infection, physical injury).&lt;ref name="criddle" /&gt; Studies have shown a [[mortality rate]] of between 6% and 10%, making it perhaps the most lethal form of abuse.&lt;ref name="understanding04"&gt;{{cite web |title=Understanding Munchausen syndrome by proxy |url=http://ps.psychiatryonline.org/article.aspx?articleid=89507#Understanding%20Munchausen%20syndrome%20by%20proxy |work=Special Report: Highlights of the 2004 Institute on Psychiatric Services |publisher=PsychiatryOnline.org |accessdate=30 January 2012 |author=Christie-Smith, D. |author2=Gartner, C. |date=1 January 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Sheridan"&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Sheridan |first=Mary S. |title=The deceit continues: an updated literature review of Munchausen Syndrome by proxy |journal=Child Abuse Negl |date=April 2003 |volume=27 |issue=4 |pages=431–451 |pmid=12686328 |doi=10.1016/S0145-2134(03)00030-9 |issn=0145-2134 |id=Unknown ID:668TR }}&lt;/ref&gt;

At the time of diagnosis, the average age of the persons affected was 4 years. Slightly over 50% were aged 24 months or younger, and 75% were under 6 years old. The average duration from onset of symptoms to diagnosis was 22 months. By the time of  diagnosis, 6% of the affected persons were dead, mostly from [[apnea]] (a common result of [[Asphyxia#Smothering|smothering]]) or starvation, and 7% suffered long-term or permanent injury. About half of the affected had siblings; 25% of the known siblings were dead, and 61% of siblings had symptoms similar to the affected or that were otherwise suspicious. The mother was the perpetrator in 76.5% of the cases, the father in 6.7%.&lt;ref name="Sheridan" /&gt;

Most present about 3 medical problems in some combination of the 103 different reported symptoms. The most-frequently reported problems are apnea (26.8% of cases), anorexia or feeding problems (24.6% of cases), diarrhea (20%), seizures (17.5%), [[cyanosis]] (blue skin) (11.7%), behavior (10.4%), asthma (9.5%), allergy (9.3%), and fevers (8.6%).&lt;ref name="Sheridan" /&gt; Other symptoms include [[failure to thrive]], vomiting, bleeding, rash, and infections.&lt;ref name="understanding04" /&gt;&lt;ref name="kidshealth.org"&gt;{{cite web |author1=Sheslow, D.V.  |author2=Gavin-Devitt, L.A. |year= 2008 |title=Munchausen by proxy syndrome |publisher= KidsHealth from Nemours|accessdate= 27 August 2010 |url= http://kidshealth.org/parent/general/sick/munchausen.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many of these symptoms are easy to fake because they are subjective. A parent reporting that their child had a fever in the past 24 hours is making a claim that is impossible to prove or disprove. The number and variety of presented symptoms contribute to the difficulty in reaching a proper MSbP diagnosis.

Aside from the motive (which is to gain attention or sympathy), another feature that differentiates MSbP from "typical" physical child abuse is the degree of premeditation involved. Whereas most physical abuse entails lashing out at a child in response to some behavior (e.g., crying, bedwetting, spilling food), assaults on the MSbP victim tend to be unprovoked and planned.&lt;ref name="Schreier-2004" /&gt;

Also unique to this form of abuse is the role that health care providers play by actively, albeit unintentionally, enabling the abuse. By reacting to the concerns and demands of perpetrators, medical professionals are manipulated into a partnership of child maltreatment.&lt;ref name="criddle" /&gt; Challenging cases that defy simple medical explanations may prompt health care providers to pursue unusual or rare diagnoses, thus allocating even more time to the child and the abuser. Even without prompting, medical professionals may be easily seduced into prescribing diagnostic tests and therapies that are at best uncomfortable and costly, and at worst potentially injurious to the child.&lt;ref name="Stirling" /&gt; If the health practitioner resists ordering further tests, drugs, procedures, surgeries, or specialists, the MSbP abuser makes the medical system appear negligent for refusing to help a sick child and their selfless parent.&lt;ref name="criddle" /&gt; Like those with Munchausen syndrome, MSbP perpetrators are known to switch medical providers frequently until they find one that is willing to meet their level of need; this practice is known as "[[doctor shopping]]" or "hospital hopping".

The perpetrator continues the abuse because maintaining the child in the role of patient satisfies the abuser's needs. The cure for the victim is to separate the child completely from the abuser. When parental visits are allowed, sometimes there is a disastrous outcome for the child. Even when the child is removed, the perpetrator may then abuse another child: a sibling or other child in the family.&lt;ref name=criddle/&gt;

Factitious disorder imposed on another can have many long-term emotional effects on a child. Depending on their experience of medical interventions, a percentage of children may learn that they are most likely to receive the positive maternal attention they crave when they are playing the sick role in front of health care providers. Several case reports describe Munchausen syndrome patients suspected of themselves having been MSbP victims.&lt;ref name="libow-2002"&gt;{{cite journal|author=Libow, JA. |title=Beyond collusion: active illness falsification |journal=Child Abuse Negl |year=2002|volume=26|issue=5|pages=525–536|doi=10.1016/S0145-2134(02)00328-9|pmid=12079088}}&lt;/ref&gt; Seeking personal gratification through illness can thus become a lifelong and multi-generational disorder in some cases.&lt;ref name="criddle" /&gt;  In stark contrast, other reports suggest survivors of MSbP develop an avoidance of medical treatment with post-traumatic responses to it.&lt;ref name="libow-adulthood"&gt;{{cite journal|author=Libow, JA. |title=Munchausen by proxy victims in adulthood: a first look |journal=Child Abuse Negl |year=1995|volume=19|issue=9|pages=1131–1142|doi=10.1016/0145-2134(95)00073-H|pmid=8528818}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This variation possibly reflects broad statistics on survivors of child abuse in general, where around 30% go on to also become abusers&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |pmid=11731348 | volume=179 | title=Cycle of child sexual abuse: links between being a victim and becoming a perpetrator | year=2001 | journal=Br J Psychiatry | pages=482–94; discussion 495–7 | doi=10.1192/bjp.179.6.482 | last1 = Glasser | first1 = M | last2 = Kolvin | first2 = I | last3 = Campbell | first3 = D | last4 = Glasser | first4 = A | last5 = Leitch | first5 = I | last6 = Farrelly | first6 = S}}&lt;/ref&gt; even though a significant percentage do not.

The adult care-provider who has abused the child often seems comfortable and not upset over the child's hospitalization. While the child is hospitalized, medical professionals must monitor the caregiver's visits to prevent an attempt to worsen the child's condition.&lt;ref name="Schreier 1993"&gt;{{cite book |last= Schreier |first= Herbert A. |author2=Judith A.

=== Warning signs ===
Warning signs of the disorder include:&lt;ref name="Schreier 1993"/&gt;

* A child who has one or more medical problems that do not respond to treatment or that follow an unusual course that is persistent, puzzling, and unexplained. 
* Physical or laboratory findings that are highly unusual, discrepant with patient's presentation or history, or physically or clinically impossible.
* A parent who appears medically knowledgeable, fascinated with medical details and hospital gossip, appears to enjoy the hospital environment, and expresses interest in the details of other patients' problems.
* A highly attentive parent who is reluctant to leave their child's side and who themselves seem to require constant attention.
* A parent who appears unusually calm in the face of serious difficulties in their child's medical course while being highly supportive and encouraging of the physician, or one who is angry, devalues staff, and demands further intervention, more procedures, second opinions, and transfers to more-sophisticated facilities.
* The suspected parent may work in the health-care field themselves or profess an interest in a health-related job.
* The signs and symptoms of a child's illness may lessen or simply vanish in the parent's absence (hospitalization and careful monitoring may be necessary to establish this causal relationship).
* A family history of similar or unexplained illness or death in a sibling.
* A parent with symptoms similar to their child's own medical problems or an illness history that itself is puzzling and unusual.
* A suspected emotionally distant relationship between parents; the spouse often fails to visit the patient and has little contact with physicians even when the child is hospitalized with a serious illness.
* A parent who reports dramatic, negative events, such as house fires, burglaries, or car accidents, that affect them and their family while their child is undergoing treatment.
* A parent who seems to have an insatiable need for adulation or who makes self-serving efforts for public acknowledgment of their abilities.
* A patient who inexplicably deteriorates whenever discharge is planned.
* A patient that looks for cueing from a parent in order to feign illness when medical personnel are present.
* A patient that is overly articulate regarding medical terminology and their own disease process for their age.
* A patient that presents to the Emergency Department with a history of repeat illness, injury, or hospitalization.

==Diagnosis==
Munchausen syndrome by proxy is a controversial term.  In the [[World Health Organization]]'s [[International Statistical Classification of Diseases]], 10th Revision ([[ICD-10]]), the official diagnosis is factitious disorder (301.51 in ICD-9, F68.12 in ICD-10).  Within the [[United States]], factitious disorder imposed on another (FDIA or FDIoA) was officially recognized as a disorder in 2013,&lt;ref name="DSM-5" /&gt; while in the [[United Kingdom]], it is known as fabricated or induced illness by carers (FII).&lt;ref name="many-names" /&gt;

In [[DSM-5]], the diagnostic manual published by the [[American Psychiatric Association]] in 2013, this disorder is listed under ''301.51 [[Factitious disorder]]''.  This, in turn, encompasses two types:&lt;ref name="DSM-5"&gt;{{Cite book

* ''Factitious disorder imposed on self'' – (formerly Munchausen syndrome).
* ''Factitious disorder imposed on another'' – (formerly Munchausen syndrome by proxy); diagnosis assigned to the perpetrator; the victim may be assigned an abuse diagnosis (e.g. [[child abuse]]).

===Terminology confusion===
Still widely used, the term "'''Munchausen syndrome by proxy'''" has led to much confusion in the literature. In the United States, the term has never officially been included as a discrete mental disorder by the [[American Psychiatric Association]],&lt;ref name="MBPBasics"&gt;{{cite web |last=Lasher |first=Louisa |url=http://www.mbpexpert.com/basics.htm |title=MBP Definitions, Maltreatment Behaviors, and Comments |accessdate=30 January 2012 |year=2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110812034655/http://www.mbpexpert.com/basics.htm |archive-date=2011-08-12 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; which publishes the widely recognized [[DSM-5|''Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders'']] (DSM), now in its fifth edition.&lt;ref name="DSM-5" /&gt; Although the DSM-III (1980) and DSM-III-R (1987) included Munchausen Syndrome, they did ''not'' include MSbP.  DSM-IV (1994) and DSM-IV-TR (2000) added MSbP as a proposal only, and finally being recognized as a disorder in DSM-5 (2013) – yet ''each'' of these last three editions of the DSM listed this disorder (or proposal) with a different name.

Elsewhere as well, ongoing lack of consensus has led to much confusion over terminology, and MSbP has been given many names in different places and at different times. What follows is a ''partial'' list of alternative names that have been either used or proposed (with approximate dates):&lt;ref name="many-names"&gt;{{cite journal |author=Burns, Kenneth |journal=Irish Journal of Applied Social Studies |title=Fabrication or Induction of Illness in a Child: a Critical Review of Labels and Literature Using Electronic Libraries |volume=5 |issue=1 |pages=74–92 |date=January 2004 |url=http://arrow.dit.ie/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1036&amp;context=ijass |format=PDF| accessdate=3 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The definition of the disorder has also been subject to controversy and confusion.  For example, while it initially included only the infliction of harmful medical care, the appellation has subsequently been extended to include cases in which the only harm arose from medical neglect, noncompliance, or even educational interference.&lt;ref name="Stirling" /&gt;

==Epidemiology==
MSbP is rare. A recent systematic study in Italy found that in a series of over 700 patients admitted to a pediatric ward, 4 cases met the diagnostic criteria for MSbP (0.53%). In this study, stringent diagnostic criteria were used, which required at least one test outcome or event that could not possibly have occurred without deliberate intervention by the MSbP person.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Ferrara|first1=P|last2=Vitelli|first2=O|last3=Bottaro|first3=G|last4=Gatto|first4=A|last5=Liberatore|first5=P|last6=Binetti|first6=P|last7=Stabile|first7=A|title=Factitious disorders and Munchausen syndrome: the tip of the iceberg.|journal=Journal of child health care : for professionals working with children in the hospital and community|date=December 2013|volume=17|issue=4|pages=366–74|pmid=23411659|doi=10.1177/1367493512462262}}&lt;/ref&gt;
One study showed that in 93 percent of MSbP cases, the abuser is the mother or another female guardian or caregiver.&lt;ref name="Schreier-2004"&gt;{{Cite journal | title= Munchausen by Proxy | year= 2004 | last1= Schreier | first1= HA | journal=Curr Probl Pediatr Adolesc Health Care | volume=34 |issue=3 | pages=126–143 | doi=10.1016/j.cppeds.2003.09.003}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This may be attributed to the prevalent socialization pattern that places females in the primary care-taking role.{{Citation needed|date=November 2014}} A [[psychodynamic]] model of this kind of maternal abuse exists.&lt;ref&gt;''See'' [[Anna Motz]]'s ''The Psychology of Female Violence: Crimes Against the Body'' (Routledge, 2001 {{ISBN|978-0-415-12675-5}}, 2nd ed. forthcoming 2008 {{ISBN|978-0-415-40387-0}}).&lt;/ref&gt;

MSbP may be more prevalent in the parents of those with a learning difficulty or mental incapacity, and as such the apparent patient could, in fact, be an adult.{{Citation needed|date=May 2016}}

Fathers and other male caregivers have been the perpetrators in only 7% of the cases studied.&lt;ref name="Sheridan" /&gt;  When they are not actively involved in the abuse, the fathers or male guardians of MSbP victims are often described as being distant, emotionally disengaged, and powerless. These men play a passive role in MSbP by being frequently absent from the home and rarely visiting the hospitalized child. Usually, they vehemently deny the possibility of abuse, even in the face of overwhelming evidence or their child's pleas for help.&lt;ref name="criddle" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Schreier-2004" /&gt;

Overall, male and female children are equally likely to be the victim of MSbP. In the few cases where the father is the perpetrator, however, the victim is three times more likely to be male.&lt;ref name="Sheridan" /&gt;

==Society and culture==

===Naming===
The name "Munchausen syndrome by proxy" (MSbP) is derived from [[Munchausen syndrome]], a different though related condition. People with Munchausen syndrome have a profound need to assume the [[sick role]], and exaggerate complaints, falsify tests, or inflict illnesses on themselves directly.&lt;ref&gt;{{EMedicine|article|291304|Factitious Disorder Imposed on Self}}&lt;/ref&gt; Munchausen syndrome by proxy perpetrators, by contrast, are willing to fulfill their need for positive attention by hurting their own child, thereby assuming the sick role onto their child, by proxy. These proxies then gain personal attention and support by taking on this fictitious "hero role" and receive positive attention from others, by appearing to care for and save their so-called sick child.&lt;ref name="criddle"&gt;{{cite journal|author=Criddle, L.|title=Monsters in the Closet: Munchausen Syndrome by Proxy|journal=CriticalCareNurse|publisher=American Association of Critical-Care Nurses|year=2010|volume=30|issue=6|pages=46–55|doi=10.4037/ccn2010737|url=http://www.aacn.org/WD/CETests/Media/C106.pdf|accessdate=2 February 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140201215847/http://www.aacn.org/WD/CETests/Media/C106.pdf|archive-date=2014-02-01|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Both are named after [[Baron Munchausen]], a literary character based on Hieronymus Karl Friedrich, Freiherr von Münchhausen (1720–1797), a German nobleman and well-known storyteller.

===Initial description===
"Munchausen syndrome" was first described by R. Asher in 1951&lt;ref name=Asher&gt;{{Cite journal | author=Asher, R.  |date=10 February 1951 |title = Munchausen's syndrome |journal=The Lancet |volume=1 |pages=339–41 |issue=6650 | doi=10.1016/S0140-6736(51)92313-6 |pmid=14805062}}&lt;/ref&gt; as when someone invents or [[exaggerates]] medical symptoms, sometimes engaging in [[self-harm]], to [[attention seeking|gain attention]] or [[sympathy]].

The term "Munchausen syndrome by proxy" was first coined by [[John Money]] and June Faith Werlwas in a 1976 paper titled ''Folie à deux in the parents of psychosocial dwarfs: Two cases''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Money|first=John|author2=Werlwas, June|title=''Folie à deux'' in the parents of psychosocial dwarfs: Two cases|journal=Bulletin of the American Academy of Psychiatry &amp; the Law|year=1976|volume=4|issue=4|pages=351–362|authorlink=John Money}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Money01121986"&gt;{{cite journal |author=Money, J. |authorlink=John Money |title=Munchausen's Syndrome by Proxy: Update|journal=Journal of Pediatric Psychology |year=1986|volume=11|issue=4|pages=583–584|doi=10.1093/jpepsy/11.4.583 |url=http://jpepsy.oxfordjournals.org/content/11/4/583.short |accessdate=30 January 2012 |pmid=3559846}}&lt;/ref&gt; to describe the abuse-induced and neglect-induced symptoms of the syndrome of [[Psychosocial short stature|abuse dwarfism]]. That same year, Sneed and Bell wrote an article titled ''The Dauphin of Munchausen: factitious passage of renal stones in a child''.&lt;ref name="sneed-bell"&gt;{{cite journal |author=Sneed, R.C., Bell R.F. |title=The Dauphin of Munchausen: Factitious Passage of Renal Stones in a Child |journal=[[Pediatrics (journal)|Pediatrics]] |volume=58 |issue=1 |pages=127–130 |date=1 July 1976 |url=http://pediatrics.aappublications.org/cgi/content/abstract/58/1/127 |accessdate=30 January 2012 |pmid=934770}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to other sources, the term was created by the British [[pediatric medicine|pediatrician]] [[Roy Meadow]] in 1977.&lt;ref name="MBP-Polle" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;

According to Meadow, one had poisoned her toddler with excessive quantities of salt. The other had introduced her own blood into her baby's urine sample. This second case occurred during a series of Outpatient visits to the Paediatric Clinic of Dr. Bill Arrowsmith at Doncaster Royal Infirmary. He referred to this behavior as Munchausen syndrome by proxy (MSbP).&lt;ref name=Meadow1977&gt;{{Cite journal | author=Meadow, Roy  |year=1977 |title = Munchausen Syndrome by Proxy: the Hinterlands of Child Abuse |journal=The Lancet |volume=310 |pages=343–5 |doi=10.1016/S0140-6736(77)91497-0 |url=http://web.tiscali.it/humanrights/articles/meadow77.html | issue=8033}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;!-- Likewise, different names like Polle syndrome were moved to the "Terminology Confusion" section. --&gt;

The medical community was initially skeptical of MSbP's existence, but it gradually gained acceptance as a recognized condition. There are now more than 2,000 case reports of MSbP in the professional literature. Reports come from developing countries, as well as the U.S., with one case from 2012&amp;ndash;2013, in [[Orlando, Florida]], and the most recent in [[Westchester, New York]], in early 2015.{{relevance inline|date=January 2018|Why mention these among 2,000 cases?

===Controversy===
{{See also|List of wrongful convictions in the United States}}
During the 1990s and early 2000s, Roy Meadow was an expert witness in several murder cases involving MSbP/FII. Dr. Meadow was knighted for his work for child protection, though later, his reputation, and consequently the credibility of MSbP, became severely damaged when several convictions of child killing, in which he acted as an expert witness, were overturned. The mothers in those cases were wrongly convicted of murdering two or more of their children, and had already been imprisoned for up to six years.&lt;ref name="bbc-mothers"&gt;{{cite news | url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/health/4723778.stm | title=Disappointed and disheartened | work=BBC News | date=17 February 2006 | accessdate=2 February 2012 | last=[[BBC]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="bbc-meadow-profile"&gt;{{cite news |last=[[BBC]] |title=Profile: Sir Roy Meadow |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/health/3307427.stm |work=BBC News |date=10 December 2003 | accessdate = 1 February 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The pivotal case was that of [[Sally Clark]]. Clark was a [[solicitor|lawyer]] wrongly convicted in 1999 of the murder of her two baby sons, largely on the basis of Meadow's evidence. As an expert witness for the prosecution, Meadow asserted that the odds of there being two [[Sudden infant death syndrome|unexplained infant deaths]] in one family were one in 73 million. That figure was crucial in sending Clark to jail but was hotly disputed by the [[Royal Statistical Society]], who wrote to the Lord Chancellor to complain.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Green |first=Peter |title=Letter from the President to the Lord Chancellor regarding the use of statistical evidence in court cases |url=http://www.rss.org.uk/uploadedfiles/userfiles/files/Letter-RSS-President-Lord-Chancellor-Sally-Clark-case.pdf |publisher=[[Royal Statistical Society]] |accessdate=3 February 2012 |format=PDF |date=23 January 2002 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120105003615/http://www.rss.org.uk/uploadedfiles/userfiles/files/Letter-RSS-President-Lord-Chancellor-Sally-Clark-case.pdf |archive-date=2012-01-05 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  It was subsequently shown that once other factors (e.g. genetic or environmental) were taken into consideration, the true odds were much greater, ''i.e.'', there was a significantly higher likelihood of two deaths happening as a chance occurrence than Meadow had claimed during the trial. Those odds in fact range from a low of 1:8500 to as high as 1:200.&lt;ref name="bbc-science-cot-deaths"&gt;{{cite news | url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/health/3307549.stm | title=The science behind cot deaths | work=BBC News | date=10 December 2003 | accessdate=2 February 2012 | last=[[BBC]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It emerged later that there was clear evidence of a ''[[Staphylococcus aureus]]'' infection that had spread as far as the child's cerebrospinal fluid.&lt;ref name=ShaikhMarch17 /&gt;  Clark was released in January 2003 after three judges quashed her convictions in the Court of Appeal in London,&lt;ref name=ShaikhMarch17&gt;{{Cite web |author=Shaikh, Thair |url=https://www.theguardian.com/society/2007/mar/17/childrensservices.uknews |title=Sally Clark, mother wrongly convicted of killing her sons, found dead at home |work=The Guardian |date=17 March 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite BAILII | litigants = R v.

Meadow was involved as a prosecution witness in three other high-profile cases resulting in mothers being imprisoned and subsequently cleared of wrongdoing&amp;nbsp;– those of [[Trupti Patel]],&lt;ref name="Patel"&gt;{{cite news |first=Stewart |last=Payne |title=Joy for mother cleared of baby deaths |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/main.jhtml?xml=/news/2003/06/12/nmum12.xml |work=[[The Daily Telegraph|The Telegraph]] |date=12 June 2003 |accessdate=1 February 2007 |location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Angela Cannings]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=[[BBC]] |title = Mother cleared of killing sons |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/wiltshire/3306271.stm |work=BBC News |date=10 December 2003 |accessdate=1 February 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Donna Anthony]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/england/somerset/4431851.stm | title=Anthony latest mother to be freed | work=BBC News | date=11 April 2005 | accessdate=2 February 2012 | last=[[BBC]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2003, [[Frederick Curzon, 7th Earl Howe|Lord Howe]], the [[Official Opposition (United Kingdom)|Opposition]] spokesman on health, accused Meadow of inventing a "theory without science" and refusing to produce any real [[evidence]] to prove that Munchausen syndrome by proxy actually exists. It is important to distinguish between the act of harming a child, which can be easily verified, and motive, which is much harder to verify and which MSbP tries to explain. For example, a caregiver may wish to harm a child out of malice and then attempt to conceal it as illness to avoid detection of abuse, rather than to draw attention and sympathy.

The distinction is often crucial in criminal proceedings, in which the prosecutor must prove both the act and the mental element constituting a crime to establish guilt. In most legal jurisdictions, a doctor can give expert witness testimony as to whether a child was being harmed but cannot speculate regarding the motive of the caregiver. FII merely refers to the fact that illness is induced or fabricated and does not specifically limit the motives of such acts to a caregiver's need for attention and/or sympathy.

In all, around 250 cases resulting in conviction in which Meadow was an expert witness were reviewed, with few{{citation needed|date=April 2015}} changes, but all where the only evidence was Meadows' expert testimony were over turned. Meadow was investigated by the British [[General Medical Council]] (GMC) over evidence he gave in the Sally Clark trial. In July 2005, the GMC declared Meadow guilty of "serious professional misconduct", and he was struck off the medical register for giving "erroneous" and "misleading" evidence.&lt;ref name="bbc-struck-off"&gt;{{cite news | url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/health/4685511.stm | title=Sir Roy Meadow struck off by GMC | work=BBC News | date=15 July 2005 | accessdate=2 February 2012 | last=[[BBC]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;
At appeal, High Court judge Mr. Justice Collins said that the severity of his punishment "approaches the irrational" and set it aside.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite BAILII | litigants = Meadow v. General Medical Council | year=2006 | num=146 | court=EWHC |division=Admin |para=57| date = 17 February 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="bbc-doctor-wins"&gt;{{cite news | url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/health/4720334.stm |title=Sally Clark doctor wins GMC case | work=BBC News | date=17 February 2006 | accessdate=2 February 2012 |last=[[BBC]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Collins's judgment raises important points concerning the liability of expert witnesses&amp;nbsp;– his view is that referral to the GMC by the losing side is an unacceptable threat and that only the Court should decide whether its witnesses are seriously deficient and refer them to their professional bodies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite BAILII | litigants = Meadow v. General Medical Council | year=2006 | num=146 |court=EWHC |division=Admin |para=21–26| date = 17 February 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to the controversy surrounding expert witnesses, an article appeared in the forensic literature that detailed legal cases involving controversy surrounding the murder suspect.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Perri|first=Frank |author2=Lichtenwald, Terrance |title=The Last Frontier: Myths &amp; The Female Psychopathic Killer |journal=Forensic Examiner|year=2010|volume=19|issue=2|pages=50–67  |url=http://www.all-about-forensic-psychology.com/support-files/female-psychopathic-killers.pdf |format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt; The article provides a brief review of the research and criminal cases involving Munchausen syndrome by proxy in which psychopathic mothers and caregivers were the murderers. It also briefly describes the importance of gathering behavioral data, including observations of the parents who commit the criminal acts. The article references the 1997 work of [[David Southall|Southall]], Plunkett, Banks, Falkov, and Samuels, in which [[Surveillance#Surveillance cameras|covert video recorders]] were used to monitor the hospital rooms of suspected MSbP victims. In 30 out of 39 cases, a parent was observed intentionally suffocating their child; in two they were seen attempting to poison a child; in another, the mother deliberately broke her 3-month-old daughter's arm. Upon further investigation, those 39 patients, ages 1 month to 3 years old, had 41 siblings; 12 of those had died suddenly and unexpectedly.&lt;ref name="covert-video"&gt;{{cite journal |title=Covert video recordings of life-threatening child abuse; lessons for child protection |journal=[[Pediatrics (journal)|Pediatrics]] |volume=100 |issue=5 |pages=735–760 |year=1997 |author=[[David Southall|Southall, D.P.]], Plunkett, M.C., Blanks, M.W., Falkov, A.F. &amp; Samuels, M.P. |doi=10.1542/peds.100.5.735 |pmid=9346973}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The use of covert video, while apparently extremely effective, raises controversy in some [[jurisdiction]]s over [[privacy|privacy rights]].

===Legal status===
In most legal jurisdictions, doctors are allowed to give evidence only in regard to whether the child is being harmed. They are not allowed to give evidence in regard to the motive. Australia and the UK have established the legal precedent that MSbP does not exist as a medico-legal entity.

In a June 2004 [[appeal]] hearing, the [[Supreme Court of Queensland]], [[Australia]], stated:

{{quotation|As the term factitious disorder (Munchausen's Syndrome) by proxy is merely descriptive of a behavior, not a psychiatrically identifiable illness or condition, it does not relate to an organized or recognized reliable body of knowledge or experience. Dr. Reddan's evidence was inadmissible.&lt;!-- American experts mostly disagree, however, and perpetrators' legal actions in the U.S. to quash descriptions and use of Munchausen syndrome by proxy have almost always failed.--&gt;&lt;ref name="R v LM"&gt;{{Cite AustLII|litigants=R v LM|source=QCA|num=192|year=2004|date=4 June 2004|pinpoint=para. 67}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The Queensland Supreme Court further ruled that the determination of whether or not a defendant had caused intentional harm to a child was a matter for the jury to decide and not for the determination by expert witnesses:

{{quotation|The diagnosis of Doctors Pincus, Withers, and O'Loughlin that the appellant intentionally caused her children to receive unnecessary treatment through her own acts and the false reporting of symptoms of the factitious disorder (Munchausen Syndrome) by proxy is not a diagnosis of a recognized medical condition, disorder, or syndrome. It is simply placing her within the medical term used in the category of people exhibiting such behavior. In that sense, their opinions were not expert evidence because they related to matters that could be decided on the evidence by ordinary jurors. The essential issue as to whether the appellant reported or fabricated false symptoms or did acts to intentionally cause unnecessary medical procedures to injure her children was a matter for the jury's determination. The evidence of Doctors Pincus, Withers, and O'Loughlin that the appellant was exhibiting the behavior of factitious disorder (Munchausen syndrome by proxy) should have been excluded.&lt;ref&gt;''Ibid.'', at para. 71&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Principles of law and implications for legal processes that may be deduced from these findings are that:
*Any matters brought before a Court of Law should be determined by the facts, not by suppositions attached to a label describing a behavior, i.e., MSBP/FII/FDBP;
*MSBP/FII/FDBP is not a mental disorder (i.e., not defined as such in DSM IV), and the evidence of a psychiatrist should not therefore be admissible;
*MSBP/FII/FDBP has been stated to be a behavior describing a form of [[child abuse]] and not a medical diagnosis of either a parent or a child. A medical practitioner cannot therefore state that a person "suffers" from MSBP/FII/FDBP, and such evidence should also therefore be inadmissible. The evidence of a medical practitioner should be confined to what they observed and heard and what [[forensic]] information was found by recognized medical investigative procedures;
*A label used to describe a behavior is not helpful in determining guilt and is prejudicial. By applying an ambiguous label of MSBP/FII to a woman is implying guilt without factual supportive and corroborative evidence;
*The assertion that other people may behave in this way, i.e., fabricate and/or induce illness in children to gain attention for themselves (FII/MSBP/FDBY), contained within the label is not factual evidence that this individual has behaved in this way. Again therefore, the application of the label is prejudicial to fairness and a finding based on fact.

The Queensland Judgment was adopted into English law in the [[High Court of Justice]] by Mr. Justice Ryder. In his final conclusions regarding Factitious Disorder, Ryder states that:

{{quotation|I have considered and respectfully adopt the dicta of the Supreme Court of Queensland in R v. LM [2004] QCA 192 at paragraph 62 and 66. I take full account of the criminal law and foreign jurisdictional contexts of that decision but I am persuaded by the following argument upon its face that it is valid to the English law of evidence as applied to children proceedings.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The terms "Munchausen syndrome by proxy" and "factitious (and induced) illness (by proxy)" are child protection labels that are merely descriptions of a range of behaviors, not a pediatric, psychiatric or psychological disease that is identifiable. The terms do not relate to an organized or universally recognized body of knowledge or experience that has identified a medical disease (i.e. an illness or condition) and there are no internationally accepted medical criteria for the use of either label.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In reality, the use of the label is intended to connote that in the individual case there are materials susceptible of analysis by pediatricians and of findings of fact by a court concerning fabrication, exaggeration, minimization or omission in the reporting of symptoms and evidence of harm by act, omission or suggestion (induction). Where such facts exist the context and assessments can provide an insight into the degree of risk that a child may face and the court is likely to be assisted as to that aspect by psychiatric and/or psychological expert evidence.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;All of the above ought to be self evident and has in any event been the established teaching of leading pediatricians, psychiatrists and psychologists for some while. That is not to minimize the nature and extent of professional debate about this issue which remains significant, nor to minimize the extreme nature of the risk that is identified in a small number of cases.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In these circumstances, evidence as to the existence of MSBP or FII in any individual case is as likely to be evidence of mere propensity which would be inadmissible at the fact finding stage (see Re CB and JB supra). For my part, I would consign the label MSBP to the history books and however useful FII may apparently be to the child protection practitioner I would caution against its use other than as a factual description of a series of incidents or behaviors that should then be accurately set out (and even then only in the hands of the pediatrician or psychiatrist/psychologist). I cannot emphasis too strongly that my conclusion cannot be used as a reason to re-open the many cases where facts have been found against a carer and the label MSBP or FII has been attached to that carer's behavior. What I seek to caution against is the use of the label as a substitute for factual analysis and risk assessment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite BAILII | litigants=A County Council v A Mother and A Father and X, Y, Z children | year=2005 | num=31 |court=EWHC |division=Fam| date=18 January 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; }}

In his book ''Playing Sick'' (2004), Marc Feldman notes that such findings have been in the minority among U.S. and even Australian courts. Pediatricians and other physicians have banded together to oppose limitations on child-abuse professionals whose work includes FII detection.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Feldman, Marc |title=Playing sick?: untangling the web of Munchausen syndrome, Munchausen by proxy, malingering &amp; factitious disorder |publisher=Brunner-Routledge |location=Philadelphia |year=2004 |pages= |isbn=0-415-94934-3 |oclc= |doi=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The April 2007 issue of the journal ''Pediatrics'' specifically mentions Meadow as an individual who has been inappropriately maligned.

===In popular culture===

Munchausen syndrome by proxy plays a key role in [[Gillian Flynn]]'s 2006 debut novel, ''[[Sharp Objects]]'', and its 2018 [[HBO]] [[Sharp Objects (miniseries)|TV miniseries adaptation]].

Munchausen syndrome by proxy is central to the background of the main protagonist, [[Saga Norén]] (played by [[Sofia Helin]]), the lead homicide detective in Malmö, in the Danish/Swedish TV series ''[[The Bridge (Danish/Swedish TV series)|The Bridge]]'' (2011). In the series, Saga's mother suffers from Munchausen syndrome by proxy, abusing Saga and her younger sister Jennifer, who commits suicide at age 14 due to the abuse.  The consequences and long-term, wide-ranging effects of the condition on the victims are explored in depth, especially in the third and fourth (final) seasons.

In Episode 6, "A Man's Price", in the American television crime drama ''[[True Detective]]'' (2014), detective Rustin Cohle (played by [[Matthew McConaughey]]) confronts a woman in custody and questions her actions revolving around her child's recent death in her care, as evidence suggests her behavior is indicative of this disorder.{{Citation needed|date=September 2018}}

Madeline Whittier, the protagonist in the 2015 book ''[[Everything, Everything (novel)|Everything, Everything]]'' and its 2017 [[Everything, Everything (film)|film adaptation]], is a victim of Munchausen syndrome by proxy, her mother raising her to believe she suffers from [[severe combined immunodeficiency]].

The film ''[[The 9th Life of Louis Drax]]'' (2016) deals with the Munchausen syndrome by proxy.

==Munchausen directed towards animals==
Medical literature describes a subset of MSbP caregivers, where the proxy is a pet rather than another person. These cases are labeled Munchausen syndrome by proxy: pet (MSbP:P). In these cases, pet owners correspond to caregivers in traditional MSbP presentations involving human proxies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Tucker HS, Finlay F, Guiton S |title=Munchausen syndrome involving pets by proxies |journal=Arch. Dis.

{{Violence against women}}
The phenomenon of the '''female homicides in Ciudad Juárez''', called in [[Spanish (language)|Spanish]] '''feminicidio''' ("[[feminicide]]") involves the violent deaths of hundreds of women and girls since 1993 in the northern [[Mexico|Mexican]] region of [[Ciudad Juárez]], [[Chihuahua (state)|Chihuahua]], a border city across the [[Rio Grande]] from the [[United States|U.S.]] city of [[El Paso, Texas]]. As of February 27, 2005, the number of murdered women in Ciudad Juárez since 1993 is estimated to be more than 370.&lt;ref name=Amnesty&gt;{{cite web|title=Mexico: Justice fails in Ciudad Juárez and the city of Chihuahua|url=http://www.amnestyusa.org/node/55339|publisher=Amnesty International|accessdate=19 March 2012|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120303095740/http://www.amnestyusa.org/node/55339|archivedate=3 March 2012|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After surveying 155 killings out of 340 documented between 1993 and 2003, a government committee found that roughly half were prompted by motives like robbery and gang wars, while a little more than a third involved sexual assault.

The murders of women and girls in Ciudad Juárez since 1993 have received international attention, primarily due to perceived government inaction in preventing [[violence against women]] and girls and bringing perpetrators to justice.&lt;ref name=Widyono&gt;{{cite journal|last=Widyono|first=Monique|title=Conceptualizing Femicide|journal=Strengthening Understanding of Femicide: Using Research to Galvanize Action and Accountability|year=2008|pages=7–25|url=http://www.path.org/publications/files/GVR_femicide_rpt.pdf|accessdate=14 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Nature of female homicides==
Evidence suggests that a specific group of women and girls are being targeted in Ciudad Juárez.&lt;ref name=Simmons /&gt;&lt;ref name=Livingston /&gt; The victims share common characteristics, and there are many similarities in the violent crimes committed against them.&lt;ref name=Simmons&gt;{{cite journal|last=Simmons|first=William|title=Remedies for the Women of Ciudad Juárez through the Inter-American Court of Human Rights|journal=Northwestern Journal of International Human Rights|year=2006|volume=4|issue=3|page=492517|url=http://www.law.northwestern.edu/journals/jihr/v4/n3/2/Simmons.pdf|accessdate=19 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Simmons /&gt;&lt;ref name=Livingston /&gt; Most of the victims are young women who come from impoverished backgrounds and work in [[maquiladora]]s, as factory workers, in other sectors of the informal economy, or are students.&lt;ref name=Simmons /&gt;&lt;ref name=Livingston /&gt;

In addition, many victims share common physical attributes, including dark skin, slender physique, and dark, shoulder-length hair.&lt;ref name=Livingston&gt;{{cite journal|last=Livingston|first=Jessica|title=Murder in Juárez: Gender, Sexual Violence, and the Global Assembly Line|journal=Frontiers: A Journal of Women Studies|year=2004|volume=25|issue=1|pages=59–76|jstor=3347254|doi=10.1353/fro.2004.0034}}&lt;/ref&gt; In terms of the crimes, similarities across cases include the rape, torture and mutilation of the victims.&lt;ref name=Simmons /&gt;&lt;ref name=Livingston /&gt;&lt;ref name="Fragoso 2"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Monarrez Fragoso|first=Julia|title=Serial Sexual Femicide in Ciudad Juárez: 1993-2001|journal=Debate Feminista|date=April 2002|volume=25|url=http://www.womenontheborder.org/sex_serial_english.pdf|accessdate=14 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Pantaleo&gt;{{cite journal|last=Pantaleo|first=Katherine|title=Gendered Violence: An Analysis of the Maquiladora Murders|journal=International Criminal Justice Review|year=2010|volume=20|issue=4|page=349365|doi=10.1177/1057567710380914|url=http://icj.sagepub.com/content/20/4/349.full.pdf+html|accessdate=14 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Amnesty 4"&gt;{{cite web|title=Ten years of abductions and murders of women in Ciudad Juárez and Chihuahua: Developments as of September 2003|url=https://www.amnesty.org/en/documents/amr41/026/2003/en/|publisher=Amnesty International|accessdate=19 March 2012|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Homicide statistics===
There are various media reports with different numbers ranging from hundreds to thousands of female homicides in the Ciudad Juárez region. For this reason, Amnesty International reports, "Inadequate official data on the crimes committed in [[Chihuahua City|Chihuahua]], particularly accurate figures on the exact number of murders and abductions of girls and women, has led to disputes around the issues that obscure the quest for justice."&lt;ref name=Amnesty /&gt;

According to [[Amnesty International]], as of February 2005, more than 370 young women and girls had been murdered in the cities of Ciudad Juárez and Chihuahua.&lt;ref name=Amnesty /&gt; More recently, prosecutors from the state of Chihuahua reported that in 2010, 270 women were killed within the state, of these murders 247 occurred in Juárez.&lt;ref name="El Paso Times"&gt;{{cite news|last=Ortega Lozano|first=Marisela|title=130 women killed in Juárez this year; Chihuahua AG says fight for women's rights painful and slow|url=http://www.elpasotimes.com/ci_18747536?IADID=Search-www.elpasotimes.com-www.elpasotimes.com|archive-url=https://archive.is/20130122001358/http://www.elpasotimes.com/ci_18747536?IADID=Search-www.elpasotimes.com-www.elpasotimes.com|dead-url=yes|archive-date=22 January 2013|accessdate=14 March 2012|newspaper=El Paso Times|date=24 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In 2011, Chihuahua's Attorney General, Carlos Manuel Salas, announced during a briefing in August 2011 that 222 women had been killed in Chihuahua since January of that year.&lt;ref name="El Paso Times" /&gt; Of these 222 murders, 130 of them occurred in Ciudad Juárez.&lt;ref name="El Paso Times" /&gt; In total, more than 300 women were murdered in the city in 2011.&lt;ref name="Amnesty 3" /&gt;

A study was conducted in 2008 on the Feminicide Database 1993–2007 at the Colegio de la Frontera Norte which documented incidents of feminicide that occurred in Ciudad Juárez from 1993–2007. Of the various different kinds of murders that were analyzed, the study found two common patterns in the data which were classified as intimate feminicide and systemic sexual feminicide.&lt;ref name=Fragoso&gt;{{cite journal|last=Monarrez Fragoso|first=Julia|title=An Analysis of Feminicide in Ciudad Juárez: 1993–2007|journal=Strengthening Understanding of Femicide: Using Research to Galvanize Action and Accountability|year=2008|pages=78–84|url=http://www.path.org/publications/files/GVR_femicide_rpt.pdf|accessdate=14 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Intimate feminicide refers to women who were killed by men that were close to them.&lt;ref name=Fragoso /&gt; According to the study, intimate feminicide accounted for 30.4% of the murders of women and girls in Juárez from 1993–2007. Systematic sexual feminicide refers to systematic patterns in the killing of women and children including kidnapping, sexual violence, torture, and body abandonment in areas such as desert areas, garbage dumps, and sewage ditches among others.&lt;ref name=Fragoso /&gt; According to the study, systemic sexual feminicide accounted for 31.8% of the murders of women in Juárez from 1993–2007.

[[File:Cd Juarez murder rate chart 1.png|thumb|450px|total number of homicides in Juárez]]

According to Molly Molloy, a research librarian and professor at [[New Mexico State University]] (also founder and maintainer of "Frontera List", a long-running mailing list dedicated to information and discussion about issues in the U.S.-Mexico border),&lt;ref name="TO"&gt;Q&amp;A with Molly Molloy: The Story of the Juarez Femicides is a ‘Myth’, Texas Observer, January 9, 2014. http://www.texasobserver.org/qa-molly-molloy-story-juarez-femicides-myth/&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://nmsu.libguides.com/profile.php?uid=3991|title=Molly Molloy - LibGuides at New Mexico State University|website=nmsu.libguides.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;  the situation in Juárez is one of "impunity regardless of gender".&lt;ref name="grassroots"&gt;Grassroots Press, May 12, 2010, http://www.grass-roots-press.com/2010/05/12/3615/&lt;/ref&gt; She states that "female murder victims have never comprised more than 18 percent of the overall number of murder victims in Ciudad Juárez, and in the last two decades that figure averages at less than 10 percent. That’s less than in the United States, where about 20 to 25 percent of the people who are murdered in a given year are women".&lt;ref name="TO" /&gt;

Other scholars also state that femicide rates in Ciudad Juárez are lower than in American cities such as Houston and Ensenada, and as a share of overall homicide rates they are typically lower than in other cities.&lt;ref&gt;A Statistical Evaluation of Femicide Rates in Mexican Cities Along the US-Mexico Border. http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=1112308&lt;/ref&gt;

==Motives==

The uncertainty about the characteristics of the perpetrators, their relationships to the victims, or their motives is primarily due to the dysfunction of the Mexican justice system as most cases have been inadequately investigated and documented.&lt;ref name=Olivera /&gt; While in many of the cases in Ciudad Juárez it has yet to be determined who exactly has committed the murders, much of the literature on this issue purports that patriarchal backlash against working women may be a potential motive for the killings.&lt;ref name=Pantaleo /&gt;

It is believed that the femicide in Ciudad Juárez may be related to organized crime (like prostitution rings) given the presence of the powerful drug cartels in the region.&lt;ref name=Olivera /&gt; Further, criminal gangs have become a permanent threat particularly to women on the border. Gang activity creates high risk for women especially due to very little institutional protection.&lt;ref name=Olivera /&gt;

This patriarchal backlash may indeed be the result of lack of employment opportunities for men and more women entering the workforce which has altered traditional gender dynamics and created a situation of conflict between the sexes.&lt;ref name=Olivera /&gt; Other researchers attribute the murders to Mexico's structural crisis including increasing poverty, unemployment, the disintegration of the peasant economy, migration, and a dysfunctional justice system.&lt;ref name=Olivera&gt;{{cite journal|last=Olivera|first=Mercedes|title=Violencia Femicida : Violence Against Women and Mexico's Structural Crisis|journal=Latin American Perspectives|year=2006|volume=33|issue=104|pages=104–114|doi=10.1177/0094582X05286092|url=http://lap.sagepub.com/content/33/2/104.full.pdf|accessdate=2 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Overall, in considering the potential motives for gendered violence against women, academic Mercedes Olivera has argued that femicide is a mechanism of domination, control, oppression, and power over women.&lt;ref name=Olivera /&gt;

==Contributing factors==

===Organized crime and drug trafficking===
{{main|Crime in Mexico|Juárez Cartel|Mexican Drug War}}

In examining [[femicide]] in Ciudad Juárez, it is important to consider the impact of the drug trade.&lt;ref name=Pantaleo /&gt; Juárez is the seat of the Mexican drug cartel which has resulted in high levels of violence that have been directed at the Mexican population.&lt;ref name="Fragoso 2" /&gt;&lt;ref name=Pantaleo /&gt; It is believed that the femicide in Ciudad Juárez may be related to the powerful drug cartels along the border.&lt;ref name=Olivera /&gt; Further, gangs have become a permanent threat particularly to women on the border. Gang activity creates high risk for women especially due to very little institutional protection.&lt;ref name=Olivera /&gt;

Often, misogyny is a common trait of gang activity.&lt;ref name=Olivera /&gt; According to a study conducted in 2008 using the Feminicide Database 1993–2007 at the Colegio de la Frontera Norte, which documented incidents of feminicide that occurred in Ciudad Juárez from 1993–2007, 9.1% of the murders of women were attributed to organized crime and drug trafficking activities.&lt;ref name=Fragoso /&gt;

From 2007-2010, the murder rate spiked by around 1000%, from around 1 reported murder per day, to around 10 murders per day on average. After the [[ATF gunwalking scandal]] where United States federal ATF agents were exposed for engaging in a scheme to "inadvertently" arm Mexican drug cartels with firearms in 2010, the rate has gradually declined from the previous status of the "murder capital of the world".

===Maquila industry===
{{main|Maquiladora}}

Maquiladoras are widely known for their cheap labor and their exploitative conditions, such as regularly violating basic [[human rights]], that often target women.&lt;ref name=Pantaleo /&gt; Women and girls often migrate from villages or rural areas in other parts of Mexico in search of work in the maquilas.&lt;ref name=Livingston /&gt; According to Livingston, this migration of women created, "a new phenomenon of mobile, independent and vulnerable working women," in cities like Ciudad Juárez.&lt;ref name=Livingston /&gt;  Women and girls are often funneled to work in areas that require lower education, and pay lower wages.&lt;ref name=Pantaleo /&gt;

Maquiladoras construct their female workforce under the notion that female workers are temporary workers, therefore justifying lower wages and creating a high turnover rate of laborers.&lt;ref name=Livingston /&gt;&lt;ref name=Pantaleo /&gt; According to Monarrez Fragoso, "the practices of the maquiladora industry towards the workers reveal a consume and dispose cycle."&lt;ref name="Fragoso 2" /&gt;  This consume and dispose cycle represents how the maquila industry creates "disposable" women referencing the devaluation and expendable nature of their labor.&lt;ref name="Fragoso 2" /&gt;

Many of the murder victims in Ciudad Juárez have been maquiladora employees.&lt;ref name=Pantaleo /&gt; Despite the expansion of the maquila industry, Juárez still remained a relatively poor and undeveloped city lacking infrastructure in some parts such as electricity and paved roads.&lt;ref name=Pantaleo /&gt; As a part of their daily commute, many women maquila workers walk through such areas to and from company buses creating vulnerability to be victimized.&lt;ref name=Livingston /&gt;&lt;ref name=Pantaleo /&gt; In addition, the increased involvement of women in the labor force may also be a contributing factor to the victimization of women and girls because of the competition for economic resources in decades in which [[male unemployment]] has been high.&lt;ref name=Livingston /&gt;&lt;ref name=Pantaleo /&gt;

===NAFTA===
{{main|North American Free Trade Agreement}}
The implementation of the [[North American Free Trade Agreement]] in 1994 resulted in the expansion of the maquiladora industry and created new opportunities for employment for women outside of the home and in the factories.&lt;ref name=Pantaleo /&gt; The availability of cheap labor made it attractive for business owners to open factories in Mexico, and the availability of cheap employment attracted many, especially women, to border towns such as Ciudad Juárez. Research has shown correlations between economic and political issues and violence against women along the border.&lt;ref name=Pantaleo /&gt;

Academic Katherine Pantaleo has argued that, "NAFTA, as a capitalist approach, has directly created a devaluation of women and an increase in gendered violence."&lt;ref name=Pantaleo /&gt; Further, according to Wright, in the time period between the implementation of NAFTA in 1994 and 2001, "the homicide rate for men increased by 300 percent, while for women it increased by 600 percent."&lt;ref name=Wright&gt;{{cite journal|last=Wright|first=Melissa M.|title=Public Women, Profit, and Femicide in Northern Mexico|journal=South Atlantic Quarterly|year=2006|volume=1054|pages=681–698|doi=10.1215/00382876-2006-003|url=http://saq.dukejournals.org/content/105/4/681.full.pdf+html|accessdate=14 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Such studies indicate the importance of exploring the effects of NAFTA when considering the possible causes of the murder of women and girls in Ciudad Juárez.&lt;ref name=Pantaleo /&gt; Consequently, it has been suggested that amendments be made to NAFTA that include human rights provisions.&lt;ref name=Pantaleo /&gt;

===Machismo and Marianismo ideology===
{{main|Machismo|Marianismo}}

Sociocultural factors in relation to traditional gender roles have impacted violence against women in Mexico.&lt;ref name=Pantaleo /&gt; According to Pantaleo, "Under the view of patriarchy, two expressions are commonly used in Mexico to show the difference in status of males and females; these expressions are [[machismo]] and [[marianismo]]."&lt;ref name=Pantaleo /&gt; [[Machismo]] is characterized by male power and aggression; while marianismo is characterized by subordination and domestic [[gender role]]s.&lt;ref name=Pantaleo /&gt; As part of the [[marianismo]] ideology, women are expected to fulfill domestic roles as wives and mothers and to refrain from paid labor outside of the home.&lt;ref name=Pantaleo /&gt;

Women who leave their homes to seek employment in the maquila industry directly challenge the marianismo ideal of womanhood.&lt;ref name=Livingston /&gt; Olivera suggests that this changed situation challenges [[hypermasculinity]], in which aggressive aspects of male identity are exaggerated in order to preserve their identity.&lt;ref name=Olivera/&gt; According to Livingston, gender-directed violence in Ciudad Juárez may be a negative reaction as women "gain greater personal autonomy and independence while men lose ground."&lt;ref name=Livingston /&gt;

== Police and governmental response ==
The murder of women in Juárez has attracted global attention since 1993 given suspected police and government inaction to prevent the murders and bring perpetrators to justice.&lt;ref name=Widyono /&gt; There have been several international rulings against Mexico for its inadequate response to the increasing violence against women.&lt;ref name=Livingston /&gt;&lt;ref name=CEDAW /&gt;&lt;ref name="Amnesty 2" /&gt; Police and government officials have been accused of responding with indifference to the crimes against women as well as exhibiting tolerance for such crimes, conducting inadequate and negligent investigations, ineffectively responding to the crimes, and failing to prevent and protect women from violence.&lt;ref name=Livingston /&gt;&lt;ref name=CEDAW /&gt;&lt;ref name="Amnesty 2" /&gt;

As a result of international attention, police and government officials have been politically pressured to respond to the murders.&lt;ref name="Amnesty 4" /&gt;  Consequently, due to political pressure for justice, police have been accused of rushing to make arrests and solve cases while the crimes continue to occur.&lt;ref name=Livingston /&gt;  Further, out of hundreds of cases, only three convictions have ever been made and there is much skepticism involving the integrity of the convictions.&lt;ref name=Simmons /&gt;

The methodology and integrity of police investigations has been questioned due to allegations of torture and human rights violations of alleged suspects.&lt;ref name=Simmons /&gt;&lt;ref name="Amnesty 4" /&gt; Amnesty International reports, "The government [has] failed to take effective measures to investigate and bring to justice those responsible for the abduction and killing of three women in Ciudad Juárez... or to combat the ongoing pattern of violence against women and discrimination in the city.&lt;ref name="Amnesty 3"&gt;{{cite web|title=Annual Report: Mexico 2011|url=http://www.amnestyusa.org/research/reports/annual-report-mexico-2011?page=show|publisher=Amnesty International|accessdate=14 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Convictions===
According to Pantaleo, "While around 400 girls and women have been abducted and murdered, few arrests and convictions have resulted."&lt;ref name="Pantaleo 2"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Pantaleo|first=Katie|title=Gendered Violence: Murder in the Maquiladoras|journal=Sociological Viewpoints|year=2006|url=http://www.pasocsociety.org/article2.pdf|accessdate=1 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; For convictions that have been made, there is a great deal of controversy that surrounds them.&lt;ref name="Pantaleo 2" /&gt;  Police have been accused of conducting rushed investigations with questionable methodology and integrity.&lt;ref name=Simmons /&gt;  Further, suspects that have been apprehended have claimed that they were tortured into confessing.&lt;ref name=Simmons /&gt;&lt;ref name="Pantaleo 2" /&gt; This has caused uncertainty of the legitimacy of both investigations and convictions.&lt;ref name=Simmons /&gt;&lt;ref name="Pantaleo 2" /&gt;

In 1996, an Egyptian national, Omar Sharif Latif or [[Abdul Latif Sharif]] was convicted of 3 murders and sentenced to a 30-year prison term.&lt;ref name=Simmons /&gt;  After his arrest in 1995, the murders continued and authorities claimed that Sharif directed members of the "Los Rebeldes" gang to continue the murders while he was incarcerated.&lt;ref name="Fragoso 2" /&gt; These members were indicted and convicted as a result of this connection.&lt;ref name=Simmons /&gt; The gang members accused of carrying out murders under Sharif's orders claimed they were tortured while in police custody.&lt;ref name="Fragoso 2" /&gt; According to Monarrez Fragoso, "In the year 2000, it was known that the body of Elizabeth Castro Garcia, whose murder was attributed to Omar Sharif Latif, does not belong to her."&lt;ref name="Fragoso 2" /&gt; His conviction is currently under appeal.&lt;ref name=Simmons /&gt;

In 2001, Victor Garcia Uribe and Gustavo Gonzalez Meza were apprehended for eight murders.&lt;ref name=Simmons /&gt; Gustavo Gonzalez Mesa died suspiciously while in police custody.&lt;ref name=Simmons /&gt; In 2004, Victor Garcia Uribe, a bus driver, was convicted of eight murders that took place in 2001.&lt;ref name=Simmons /&gt;  He confessed to these murders but claimed that he was tortured into confessing by police.&lt;ref name=Simmons/&gt;

In 2008, 16-year-old Ruby Frayre Escobedo was murdered by Sergio Barraza Bocanegra who was acquitted at his first trial for lack of evidence. Following two years of activism, a retrial convicted Bocanegra who remained on the run. In 2010, Ruby's mother, [[Marisela Escobedo Ortiz]], was assassinated by a shot to the head at point blank range while demonstrating for justice in front of the Governor's Palace in [[Chihuahua (state)|Chihuahua]].&lt;ref name="icm"&gt;{{cite web

==International justice==
There have been several international rulings against Mexico for its inadequate response to the increasing violence against women.&lt;ref name=CEDAW /&gt;&lt;ref name="Amnesty 2" /&gt; According to Livingston, "In 1998 the National Commission for Human Rights issued a report charging gross irregularities and general negligence in state investigations, including the misidentification of corpses, failure to obtain expert tests on forensic evidence, failure to conduct autopsies or obtain semen analysis...  failure to file written reports, [and] incompetence in keeping records of the rising tide of women murders."&lt;ref name=Livingston /&gt;

In 2004, under the [[Optional Protocol to the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women]] (CEDAW) conducted an inquiry into the allegations that hundreds of murders of women and girls had taken place in the area of Ciudad Juarez since 1993 at the urging of several NGOs.&lt;ref name=CEDAW /&gt; In order for the inquiry to take place it was required that there was reliable evidence that showed that Mexico was in violation of rights established by CEDAW.&lt;ref name=CEDAW /&gt; The Committee analyzed the gender-based crimes occurring in Ciudad Juárez and found the two common forms were murder and disappearances. The Committee also analyzed the response of the government and found that their initial response was indifference and that the government exhibited tolerance of these crimes for years.&lt;ref name=CEDAW&gt;{{cite journal|last=Sokhi-Bulley|first=Bal|title=The Optional Protocol to CEDAW: First Steps|journal=Human Rights Law Review|year=2006|volume=6|issue=1|pages=143–159|doi=10.1093/hrlr/ngi029|url=http://hrlr.oxfordjournals.org/content/6/1/143.full|accessdate=14 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Further, the Committee concluded that the measures undertaken by the Mexican State in response to gendered violence against women leading up to the time of their inquiry were, "few and ineffective at all levels of the State".&lt;ref name=CEDAW /&gt; The Committee made several recommendations for Mexico to adhere to. Although these recommendations were not legally binding, they were influential in the public sphere.&lt;ref name=CEDAW /&gt;

According to Amnesty International, "In [2009], the [[Inter-American Court of Human Rights]] ruled on the “cotton field” ([[Campo Algodonero in Cd. Juarez|Campo Algodonero]]) case that Mexico was guilty of discrimination and of failing to protect three young women murdered in 2001 in Ciudad Juárez or to ensure an effective investigation into their abduction and murder."&lt;ref name="Amnesty 2"&gt;{{cite web|title=Mexico - Amnesty International Report 2010|url=https://www.amnesty.org/en/region/mexico/report-2010|publisher=Amnesty International|accessdate=19 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Court ordered Mexico to conduct a new investigation of the murders, create a national memorial for the victims, pay reparations to the families of the victims, and to improve measures which prevent and adequately investigate the murder of women and girls.&lt;ref name="El Paso Times" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Amnesty 2" /&gt;

==Local activism==

According to Simmons, "The murders in Juárez would not have drawn such national and international attention if it were not for the heroic efforts of the victims' families and other women."&lt;ref name=Simmons /&gt; There have been numerous local and international organizations that have helped draw attention to the issue of the murder of women in Juárez which has helped to create pressure for the Mexican government to agree to further its efforts to respond to violence against women.&lt;ref name=Amnesty /&gt; Further, the work of political leaders, activists, artists, academics, and journalists combined have also been instrumental in bringing international attention to the murder of women in Juárez and the issues that surround them.&lt;ref name=Wright /&gt;

In 1999, a group of feminist activists founded Casa Amiga, Juárez's first rape crisis and sexual assault center.&lt;ref name="Wright 2"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Wright|first=Melissa W.|title=A Manifest against Femicide|journal=Antipode|date=December 2002|volume=33|issue=3|pages=550–566|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/1467-8330.00198/pdf|accessdate=16 April 2012|doi=10.1111/1467-8330.00198}}&lt;/ref&gt; The center works to provide women in Juárez with a refuge against violence, therapy, legal council, and medical attention.&lt;ref name="Wright 2" /&gt; Casa Amiga also works to raise public awareness both locally and internationally regarding the exploitation and dehumanization of women in Juárez.

In 2002, a social justice movement named Ni Una Mas, which in Spanish means "not one more," was formed to raise international awareness to violence against women in Juárez.&lt;ref name=Wright /&gt; The movement consists of a variety of domestic and international organizations and individual activists.&lt;ref name=Wright /&gt; Ni Una Mas participants demand that the Mexican state implement strategies that prevent violence against women including murder and kidnappings and that the state conduct competent investigations on crimes already committed.&lt;ref name=Wright /&gt;

In addition to Casa Amiga and Ni Una Mas, family support groups such as [[Nuestras Hijas de Regreso a Casa A.C.]], which in Spanish means "Our Daughters Back Home," have also formed in response to the violence against women in Juárez.&lt;ref name="Wright 2" /&gt; [[Nuestras Hijas de Regreso a Casa A.C.]] has also worked to bring domestic and international media attention to the violence against women in Juárez.&lt;ref name=Lorenzo&gt;{{cite journal|last=Blanco|first=Lorenzo|author2=Sandra M.

The '''Gate Fire''' was a [[wildfire]] that burned in the [[Dulzura]] area southeast of [[Jamul, California|Jamul]] along [[California State Route 94|Highway 94]] in the southern part of [[San Diego County]], [[California]] in May 2017. Within the day, the fire spread from an initially reported {{convert|10|acres}} to then {{convert|1,500 |acres}} in a matter of a few hours, as the fire was pushed by strong winds and dry grasslands mixed with chaparral.  &lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://twitter.com/CALFIRESANDIEGO/status/866000081752694784|title=CALFIRESANDIEGO at scene of a vegetation fire Hwy 94 south of Jamul.

==Events==
Around 11:20 am on May 20, the fire was first reported burning with a moderate-to-rapid rate of spread near Highway 94 and Otay Lakes Road.

The '''Georgian National Opera and Ballet Theater of Tbilisi''' ({{lang-ka|თბილისის ოპერისა და ბალეტის სახელმწიფო აკადემიური თეატრი}}), formerly known as the '''Tiflis Imperial Theater''', is an [[opera house]] situated on [[Rustaveli Avenue]] in [[Tbilisi]], [[Georgia (country)|Georgia]]. Founded in 1851, Tbilisi Opera is the main opera house of Georgia and one of the oldest such establishments in eastern [[Europe]].

Since 1896, the theater has resided in an exotic [[Moorish Revival architecture|neo-Moorish]] edifice originally constructed by [[Victor Schröter|Victor Johann Gottlieb Schröter]], a prominent architect of [[Baltic German]] origin. Although definitively [[Orientalism|Oriental]] in its decorations and style, the building's layout, foyers and the main hall are that of a typical [[Europe|European]] opera house. Since its foundation, the theater has been damaged by several fires and underwent major rehabilitation works under [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] and [[Cabinet of Georgia (country)|Georgian]] leadership; the most recent restoration effort concluded in January 2016, having taken six years and costing approximately 40 million [[United States dollar|U.S. dollars]], donated by a Georgian business foundation.&lt;ref&gt;Andrew North.

The opera house is one of the centers of cultural life in Tbilisi and was once home to [[Zacharia Paliashvili]], the Georgian national composer whose name the institution has carried since 1937. The Opera and Ballet Theater also houses the [[State Ballet of Georgia]] under the leadership of internationally renowned Georgian ballerina [[Nina Ananiashvili]]. In recent years it has hosted opera stars such as [[Montserrat Caballé]] and [[José Carreras]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://eng.primenewsonline.com/news/123/ARTICLE/17554/2007-12-14.html Montserrat Caballé To Give Concert At Opera Theater in Tbilisi] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071226091256/http://eng.primenewsonline.com/news/123/ARTICLE/17554/2007-12-14.html |date=2007-12-26 }}&lt;/ref&gt; while also serving as a traditional venue for national celebrations and presidential inaugurations. 

==Origin and socio-political underpinnings==
The foundation of the Tiflis Imperial Opera was closely intertwined with the turbulent political processes in Georgia following the country's annexation by the [[Russian Empire]] in 1801. In the first half of the [[19th century]], Georgia remained a restless and poorly integrated part of the empire. Unhappy with Russian policies, in 1832 Georgian aristocracy hatched a plot against the local Russian authorities, which was discovered and resulted in multiple arrests and repressions in the subsequent years. Anxious to reconcile the Georgian opinion in view of these lingering difficulties, the new [[Caucasus Viceroyalty (1801–1917)|Viceroy of the Caucasus]], Count [[Mikhail Semyonovich Vorontsov|Mikhail Vorontsov]], implemented a number of cultural initiatives, one of which was the foundation of the opera. The declared purpose of its establishment was to benefit the "public well-being" but it also served an important political goal of fully integrating the local Georgian aristocracy into the Imperial social life, thereby distracting them from any further anti-Russian conspiracies.&lt;ref&gt;Austin Jersild. ''Orientalism and Empire: North Caucasus Mountain Peoples and the Georgian Frontier'', 1845-1917, McGill-Queen's Press, p. 64&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Donald Rayfield]]. ''Edge of Empires: A History of Georgia.'' [[Reaktion Books]]; 2013, p. 286&lt;/ref&gt; 

[[File:Tiflis, The Imperial Theater, 1870s (A).jpg|thumb|left|Tiflis theater in the late 1800s]]

To satisfy Georgians, Vorontsov went on to patronize Georgian-language theater performances and did everything [[Saint Petersburg]] would permit to win over locals. These type of efforts were particularly relevant in light of the ongoing [[Caucasian War|Shamil's rebellion]] in the [[North Caucasus]], which prompted some Russians to see Georgian aristocrats as the only bulwark protecting Russia's southern imperial borders.&lt;ref&gt;[[Donald Rayfield]]. ''The Literature of Georgia: A History.'' [[Routledge]], 2013; p. 151&lt;/ref&gt; Vorontsov's conciliatory efforts were not without controversy, as not all Russians were enthusiastic about non-Russian contributions to the city's cultural development; some objected to Georgian-language productions and had them moved to different days, rather than precede regular opera performances as it was done up to that point.&lt;ref&gt;Michael David-Fox, Peter Holquist, Alexander Martin. Orientalism and Empire in Russia. Slavica: 2006, p. 305&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Georgian National Opera Theater draft (1881).jpg|thumb|right|Tiflis theater draft made by [[Victor Schröter]].]]

At Vorontsov's initiative, the original theater site was chosen on [[Rustaveli Avenue]] in [[Freedom Square, Tbilisi|Erivan Square]], an area the administration correctly envisioned would be the center of the expanding city. The land was given free of charge from the governor of the [[Tiflis Governorate]], provided the theater would belong to the city.&lt;ref name="history"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.georgianpress.ru/tbilisi-week/our-past/10594-tbilisskaya-opera-istoriya-sozdaniya.html |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130215102312/http://www.georgianpress.ru/tbilisi-week/our-past/10594-tbilisskaya-opera-istoriya-sozdaniya.html |archivedate=15 February 2013 |script-title=ru:Тбилисская опера - история создания|work=Tbilisi Week|author=Malkhaz Ebralidze |date=9 January 2013 |trans-title=Tbilisi Opera - History of its Creation |language=ru}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The foundations of The Tiflis Imperial Theater were laid down on 15 April 1847. Italian architect [[Giovanni Scudieri]], who had come to Tiflis from [[Odessa]], was hired to oversee the project. The construction was completed in 1851.&lt;ref name="history" /&gt;The interior of the theater was decorated by a Parisian designer, using colored velvet, gold and silver details, and expensive silks. A massive chandelier  weighing {{convert|1218|kg|lb}},  unassembled in 12 large boxes, was shipped by a steamer from Marseille to Kulevi on the Black Sea coast. Buffalo pulled the chandelier more than {{convert|300|km|mi}} to Tiflis.&lt;ref name="history" /&gt; Russian painter [[Grigory Gagarin]] created the artwork for the theater. Vorontsov appointed writer [[Vladimir Sollogub]] as the theater's first director.

==Opening and the first performances==
[[File:Tbilisi Opera House in 12 april 1851 (A).jpg|thumb|right|Grand opening, 12 April 1851]]
On 12 April 1851, the theater held its grand opening, attended by the high society of Tiflis. As the theater stage was not yet complete, the theater instead held a masked ball and charity fundraiser for the [[Saint Nino]] Women's College.

Several months later the popular Parisian newspaper ''[[L'Illustration]]'' (issue 25 October 1851)  printed a large article by Edmond de Bares with two pictures of the interior of the theater. The author wrote, "This is the only theatre in the city, the interior of which is totally [[Moorish]] in style, and is doubtless one of the most elegant, beautiful and fascinating theatrical constructions, conceived by man."&lt;ref name="history" /&gt;

In the spring of 1851, the theater director invited an Italian opera troupe, which had been touring the Russian Empire under the conductorship of [[Francisco Asenjo Barbieri]], to perform in Tiflis. The Italians traveled by carriage from [[Novocherkassk]], but became ill and exhausted as they made their way into the [[Caucasus Mountains]]. By the time they reached [[Stavropol]] in southern Russia, they had lost all patience and refused to continue to Tiflis. Finally they resumed, pausing often to rest as they traveled via the [[Georgian Military Highway]], before arriving in Tiflis on 9 October 1851.&lt;ref name="history" /&gt;

One month later, the first theatrical season officially opened in Tiflis with ''[[Lucia di Lammermoor]]'' by [[Gaetano Donizetti]]. After the spectacle, which had a great success, the hosts led Barbieri and the company to the left bank of the [[Kura (Caspian Sea)|Kura River]] for a public feast, where people celebrated on boats for the whole night. 

The Italians performed 12 different opera performances over the course of three months. As a consequence the orchestra was enriched with new instruments and [[Musical composition|musical scores]]. Foreign orchestra performers came to Tiflis and some settled there.&lt;ref name="history" /&gt;

==Fire and reconstruction==
[[File:Burned Tbilisi opera 1874.jpg|thumb|right|Theater following the devastating 1874 fire]]
On 11 October 1874, a fire began before a performance of  [[Vincenzo Bellini]]'s ''[[Norma (opera)|Norma]]''. Though the fire brigade was across the street, the firefighters did not respond at first and did not bring ladders when they did, leading to outrage and accusations of the fire being intentional. The theater was completely destroyed, including the rich musical library, costumes, scenery, props and all of Gagarin's paintings.&lt;ref name="history" /&gt;

Plans were made to rebuild the opera house. The theater decided to continue its season from the "Summer Theater", and returned 27 December with its production of ''Norma''. 

The city held a contest for a new architectural design. [[Viktor Schröter]], an architect of German origin from [[Saint Petersburg]], submitted the winning design. Construction of the new theater took years to get underway. There were repeated delays throughout the project, with the design not officially approved by Governor [[Grand Duke Michael Nikolaevich of Russia|Grand Duke Michael Nikolaevich]] until 1880. Even after the construction began, it would sometimes come to a complete halt.&lt;ref name="history" /&gt;

The theater finally reopened in 1896.

==20th century==
[[File:Es Ra Katso?.jpg|thumb|Statue to [[George Balanchine]]]]

In 1937, the theater was renamed in honour of [[Zacharia Paliashvili]], one of Georgia's national composers. Unrest and destabilization in Georgia in the 1990s affected the Tbilisi opera theater, as it did many others in the country. The government could not provide sufficient resources for theater to function: this prevented the creation of new scenery or costumes, the recruitment of  artists, and maintenance of the already vulnerable building. Following the [[Rose Revolution]], however, the newly elected government improved the situation in opera as part of its cultural reforms.

'''Global alert''' is used as the global [[radio]]-[[Telecommunication|communications]] [[telecommunications network|network]] during times of international crises or threats to international security. Global Alerts are also issued by agencies such as the [[World Health Organization]] (WHO), when there is a perceived threat of international [[pandemic]], (global [[epidemic]]), such as the threat of a [[SARS]], (Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome), pandemic during March 2003, due to its high contagion level which was rapidly spread by travelers sharing international flights. The global alert released by the World Health Organization regarding the SARS outbreak and its rapid contagion saved many lives: The alert about the disease, precautionary measures, and preventive measures to be taken by individuals, including specific hygiene information needed to arrest the spread of SARS was communicated instantly throughout the world.

== Global Outbreak Alert &amp; Response Network (GOARN) ==

{{main|Global Outbreak Alert and Response Network}}

GOARN is a system of cooperating institutions and networks that are constantly ready to respond to disease outbreaks. Established in 2000, it is a branch of the World Health Organization. GOARN's partners include the [[International Red Cross and Red Crescent Movement|Red Cross]] and divisions of the United Nations such as [[UNICEF]] and [[United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees|UNHCR]]. In addition to providing aid to areas affected by disease outbreaks, GOARN also works to standardize protocols for medical response systems.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = WHO {{!}} Global Outbreak Alert &amp; Response Network|url = http://www.who.int/ihr/alert_and_response/outbreak-network/en/|website = www.who.int|accessdate = 2015-11-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''HMS ''Captain''''' was an unsuccessful warship built for the [[Royal Navy]] due to public pressure. She was a masted [[turret ship]], designed and built by a private contractor against the wishes of the Controller's department.  The ''Captain'' was completed in April 1870 and [[capsize]]d in September 1870 with the loss of nearly 500 lives because of design and construction errors that led to inadequate [[Stability conditions (watercraft)|stability]].&lt;ref name=MOFWAR&gt;{{cite book|title= Man of War a History of the Combat Vessel|last1=Macintyre|first1=Donald|last2=Bathe|first2=Basil W|publisher=Mcgraw-hill Inc|date=1974|isbn=9780070445857|page=103|work=Reference to the capsize and sinking}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
The history of the ''Captain'' can be traced back to the [[Crimean War]] and the experiences of British captain [[Cowper Phipps Coles]] in 1855. Coles and a group of British sailors constructed a [[raft]] with guns protected by a 'cupola' and used the raft, named the [[Siege of Taganrog|''Lady Nancy'']], to shell the Russian town of [[Taganrog]] in the [[Black Sea]]. The ''Lady Nancy'' "proved a great success",&lt;ref name="captain1p21"&gt;Preston 2002, p. 21.&lt;/ref&gt; and Coles patented his rotating turret after the war. Following Coles' patenting, the British [[Admiralty]] ordered a [[prototype]] of Coles' design in 1859, which was installed in the floating battery vessel, [[HMS Trusty (1855)|HMS ''Trusty'']], for trials in 1861.

The trials with the ''Trusty'' impressed the Admiralty, and it ordered a coastal defence vessel, [[HMS Prince Albert (1864)|HMS ''Prince Albert'']], to be built with four of Coles' turrets and a wooden 121-gun [[first rate]] ship-of-the-line under construction, [[HMS Royal Sovereign (1857)|HMS ''Royal Sovereign'']], to be converted to a turret ship. The ''Prince Albert'' was completed with four turrets mounting single 12-ton 9-inch guns and {{convert|4.5|in|mm|adj=mid|-thick}} [[armour plate]] on the hull. The ''Royal Sovereign'' had five 10.5-inch, 12.5-ton guns in one twin and three single turrets.&lt;ref name = "Brown1 p42-4"&gt;Brown 2003, pp. 42–44.&lt;/ref&gt;

Both ships were [[flush deck]] with only a [[jury rig]], and could only operate as coastal service vessels.&lt;ref&gt;This kind of vessel is often referred to as a ''coast defence ship'', some argue there was nothing defensive about the role intended for ''Royal Sovereign'' – she was intended for attack for enemy ports such as [[Cherbourg]] But there is little evidence to support this claim.  Coles himself envisaged a fleet of such vessels replacing three-decker ships-of-the-line (of which Royal Sovereign was the prototype) and 'blockships' for coast defence first and possibly as alternatives to sea-going ironclads like HMS Warrior second.  Few at the Admiralty seriously considered the idea of trusting turret-ships against the multi-layered, modern coastal defences networks of 1st-class naval arsenals such as Cherbourg or Cronstadt or even New York Harbor.  Royal Sovereign drew too much water, had a slow rate of fire and relatively high-profile compared with American turret varieties (the monitors) which themselves failed to blast their way into Charleston harbor in 1863.&lt;/ref&gt; The Admiralty, although impressed with Coles' rotating turret, required oceangoing vessels to protect its worldwide empire. Unfortunately for Coles, engine technology had not yet caught up with his designs and consequently oceangoing ships required sails. Combining rigging, masts, and turrets proved complicated if rigging was not to impede the turrets' arcs of fire.

In early 1863 the Admiralty gave Coles permission to work with [[Nathaniel Barnaby]], head of staff of the Department of Naval Construction, on the design of a rigged vessel with two turrets and three tripod masts. In June 1863 the Admiralty suspended progress on the vessel until the [[HMS Royal Sovereign (1857)|''Royal Sovereign'']] finished her trials.

In 1864, Coles was allowed to start a second project: a rigged vessel with only one turret and based on the design of [[HMS Pallas (1865)|HMS ''Pallas'']].  He was lent the services of Joseph Scullard, Chief [[technical drawing|Draughtsman]] of [[Portsmouth Dockyard]].&lt;ref name="Brown1 p44"&gt;Brown 2003, p. 44.&lt;/ref&gt;

The next year, 1865, a committee established by the Admiralty to study the new design concluded that while the turret should be adopted, Coles' one-turret warship design had inadequate fire arcs.&lt;ref name="captain1p22"&gt;Preston 2002, p. 22.&lt;/ref&gt; The committee proposed a two-turret fully rigged vessel with either two 9-inch ''(12 ton)'' guns per turret, or one 12-inch ''(22 ton)'' gun per turret. The committee's proposal was accepted by the Admiralty, and construction was started on  ''[[HMS Monarch (1868)|Monarch]]''. ''Monarch's'' two turrets were each equipped with two 12-inch ''(25-ton)'' guns.

Stunned by the committee's decision to cancel his single-turret ship and his proposal for a two-turret vessel, and objecting to the ''Monarch's'' design, Coles launched a strong campaign against the project, attacking [[Robert Spencer Robinson]], Controller of the Navy, and various other members of the committee and the Admiralty. So vociferously did Coles complain that in January 1866 his contract as a consultant to the Admiralty was terminated. At the end of January, his protestations that he had been misunderstood led to his being re-employed from 1 March 1866.&lt;ref name="Brown1 p47"&gt;Brown 2003, p. 47.&lt;/ref&gt; Further, Coles lobbied the press and Parliament and was eventually able to force the Admiralty to allow him to build his own two-turret design.

==Design and construction==
[[File:The turret ship HMS ‘Captain’ RMG BHC3771.tiff|thumb|Oil painting of the ''Captain'', c. 1870]]
On 8 May 1866, Coles informed the Admiralty of his selection of [[Laird Brothers]]' [[Merseyside]] yard, for the builder of the warship. The Merseyside yard had already built several successful iron warships.  In mid-July, Lairds submitted two possible designs for Coles' proposed turret-ship.&lt;ref name="captain1p23"&gt;Preston 2002, p. 23.&lt;/ref&gt; To prevent the rigging from being damaged when the guns fired through it, it was attached to a platform mounted above the gun turrets known as the [[Deck (ship)#Hurricane deck|hurricane deck]] instead of brought down to the main deck. [[Tripod mast]]s were also used to minimise [[standing rigging]].&lt;ref name="Conways60 p21"&gt;Chesneau and Kolesnik 1979, p. 21.&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:HMS Captain at Chatham 1869.jpg|thumb|260px|HMS Captain at Chatham 1869]]
The design called for the ship to have a low freeboard, and Coles' figures estimated it at {{convert|8|ft|m}}. Both the [[Third Sea Lord|Controller]] [[Robert Spencer Robinson|Vice-Admiral Sir Robert Spencer Robinson]] and the Chief Constructor [[Edward James Reed]] raised serious concerns. Robinson noted that the low freeboard could cause flooding issues on the [[gun deck]], and Reed criticised the design in 1866 both for being too heavy and for having too high a [[centre of gravity]]. On the latter, Reed noted that it would cause issues "especially as it is proposed to spread a large surface of canvas upon the ''Captain''".&lt;ref&gt;Hawkey, Arthur: ''HMS Captain.'' G. Bell, 1963, page 52&lt;/ref&gt; As the design neared completion, the First Lord of the Admiralty, [[John Pakington, 1st Baron Hampton|Sir John Pakington]], wrote on 23 July 1866 to Coles approving the building of the ship, but noting that responsibility for failure would lie on Coles' and the builders' lap.&lt;ref name = "Brown1 p47-8"&gt;Brown 2003, pp. 47–48.&lt;/ref&gt;

In November 1866, the contract for HMS ''Captain'' was approved,&lt;ref name="captain1p23"/&gt; and the design was finished. She was laid down 30 January 1867 at Laird's yard at [[Birkenhead]], England, launched 27 March 1869&lt;ref name="Conways60 p21"/&gt; and completed in March 1870.&lt;ref name="captain1p24"&gt;Preston 2002, p. 24.&lt;/ref&gt;

Insufficient supervision during the building, owing partly to Coles' protracted illness,&lt;ref&gt;Dalrymple Hay, Sir John Charles: ''Remarks on the loss of H.M.S. "Captain".'' E. Stanford, 1871, page 33&lt;/ref&gt; meant that she was {{convert|735|LT|t}} heavier than planned.&lt;ref name=city&gt;[http://www.cityofart.net/bship/captain.htm HMS ''Captain'']&lt;/ref&gt; The designed freeboard was just {{convert|8|ft|m}}, and the additional weight forced her to float {{convert|22|in|m}} deeper than expected, bring the freeboard down to just {{convert|6|ft|6|in|m}}.&lt;ref&gt;Paine, Lincoln P.: '' Warships of the World to 1900. Volume 799.'' Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, 2000, page 31. {{ISBN|0-395-98414-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; This compares with {{convert|14|ft|m}} for the two-turret ''Monarch''.&lt;ref name =harvnb&gt;
{{cite news|title=The Loss of the Captain|first=John|last=Scott Russell|year=1870|newspaper=Macmillan's Magazine|page=477|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=MrcZAQAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA477&amp;source=gbs_selected_pages&amp;cad=3#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|ref=harvnb}}
&lt;/ref&gt; The centre of gravity of the vessel also rose by about ten inches during construction. Reed raised havoc over the problems with the freeboard and the centre of gravity, but his objections were over-ruled during the ''Captain's'' trials.&lt;ref name=city/&gt;

She was [[ship commissioning|commissioned]] on 30 April 1870 under Captain [[Hugh Talbot Burgoyne]], [[Victoria Cross|VC]]. During trials in the following months, the ''Captain'' seemed to be everything that Coles promised and won over many followers. In trials versus the ''Monarch'', she performed well and returned to sea in July and August, travelling to [[Vigo]], Spain and [[Gibraltar]] in separate runs.

== Gunnery trials ==
[[File:HMS Captain 1869 on deck.jpg|thumb|HMS Captain on deck]]
A trial was undertaken in 1870 to compare the accuracy and rate of fire of turret-mounted heavy guns with those in a centre-battery ship.  The target was a {{convert | 600 |ft |m}} long, {{convert |60|ft|m }} high rock off [[Vigo]].  The speed of the ships was {{convert|4 - 5| kn| mph kph}} ("some accounts say stationary").&lt;ref name=WtoDp50/&gt;    Each ship fired for five minutes, with the guns starting "loaded and very carefully trained".&lt;ref name=WtoDp50/&gt;  The guns fired [[Palliser shot and shell|Palliser shells]] with battering charges at a range of about {{convert | 1,000 |yds|km}}.&lt;ref name=WtoDp50/&gt;  Three out of the ''Captain's'' four hits were achieved with the first salvo; firing this salvo caused the ship to roll heavily (±20°); smoke from firing made aiming difficult.&lt;ref name=WtoDp50/&gt; Note that the ''Captain'' could be expected to capsize if inclined 21°.&lt;ref name=ParkesP141&gt;An [[inclining test]] at Portsmouth conducted on 29 July 1870 suggested that the ''Captain's'' extreme heel with safety in smooth water was 15°-16°;  calculations completed by 23 August 1870 showed that her danger angle was 21°, as had been predicted by  [[John Laird (shipbuilder)|Lairds]] in January or February 1870.&lt;br&gt;{{cite|pages = 141-2 |last1 = Parkes |first1 = Oscar|title=British Battleships|date = 1966|edition=2}}&lt;br&gt;{{cite |title = Warrior to Dreadnought | last1= Brown |first1 = David K | publisher = Chatham Publishing | date = 1997 | ISBN = 1861760221 | pages=48, 50-51 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The ''Monarch'' and the ''Hercules'' also did better with their first salvo, were inconvenienced by the smoke of firing, and to a lesser extent were caused to roll by firing.&lt;ref name=WtoDp50/&gt; On the ''Hercules'' the gunsights were on the guns, and this worked better than the turret roof gunsights used by the other ships.&lt;ref name=WtoDp50/&gt;

==Sinking==
[[File:HMS Captain 1869 in heavy seas.jpg|thumb|HMS Captain 1869 in heavy seas]]
On the afternoon of 6 September 1870 ''Captain'' was cruising with the combined Mediterranean and Channel Squadrons comprising 11 ships off [[Cape Finisterre]]. The ship made 9.5 knots under sail in a force six wind, which was increasing through the day. The commander in chief, [[Sir Alexander Milne, 1st Baronet|Admiral Sir Alexander Milne]],&lt;ref name=BallardandFitzgerald&gt;&lt;br&gt; {{cite|title=The black battlefleet|last1=Ballard|first1= George Alexander |author-link=George Alexander Ballard|date=1980|publisher=Nautical Publishing Company Ltd|isbn=0245530304|pages=110-1}}&lt;br&gt;{{cite|title= Memories of the sea|last1=Fitzgerald |first1= Penrose |author-link=Charles Cooper Penrose-Fitzgerald|publisher= Edward Arnold |date= 1913|pages=278-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; was on board to see her performance, and speed had risen to 11–13 knots before he departed. Not being accustomed to ships with such low freeboard, he was disturbed to note that at this speed with the strengthening sea, waves washed over the weather deck. The weather worsened with rain as the night progressed, and the number of sails was reduced. The wind was blowing from the port bow so that sails had to be angled to the wind, speed was much reduced, and there was considerable force pushing the ship sideways. As the wind rose to a gale, sail was reduced to only the fore staysail and fore and main topsails.&lt;ref&gt;Padfield p.50&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:The sinking of HMS Captain.jpg|thumb|The sinking of the ''Captain'', by [[William Frederick Mitchell]]]]
Shortly after midnight when a new watch came on duty, the ship was heeling over eighteen degrees and was felt to lurch to starboard twice. Orders were given to drop the fore topsail and release sheets (ropes) holding both topsails angled into the wind.&lt;ref&gt;Padfield p.51&lt;/ref&gt; Before the captain's order could be carried out, the roll increased, and she capsized and sank with the loss of around 480 lives, including Coles. The [[First Lord of the Admiralty]], [[Hugh Childers]], and [[Under-Secretary of State for War]], [[Thomas George Baring, 1st Earl of Northbrook|Thomas Baring]], both lost sons in the disaster. Only 27 of the crew survived, many by making it to a boat which had broken free.&lt;ref name="Sandler2004"&gt;{{cite book|author=Stanley Sandler|title=Battleships: An Illustrated History of Their Impact|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=i9-0ZuKsMvIC&amp;pg=PA32|year=2004|publisher=ABC-CLIO|isbn=978-1-85109-410-3|page=32}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Court-martial ==
The subsequent investigation on the loss of ''Captain'', in the form of a [[court-martial]],&lt;ref name="Brown p51"&gt;Brown 2003, p. 51.&lt;/ref&gt; under Sir [[James Hope (Royal Navy officer)|James Hope]], took place on board [[HMS Duke of Wellington (1852)|HMS ''Duke of Wellington'']], in [[Portsmouth]] Harbour. It was somewhat of a departure for the Admiralty to seek scientific advice, but eminent engineers [[William Thomson, 1st Baron Kelvin|William Thomson]] (later Lord Kelvin) and [[William John Macquorn Rankine]] were appointed to the enquiry. It concluded that the ship was insufficiently stable: at 14 degrees heel (when the edge of the deck touched the sea) the [[Metacentric height#Righting arm|righting moment]] due to the buoyancy pushing the ship upright again was just 410-foot-tons (1.2&amp;nbsp;MN·m). [[HMS Monarch (1868)|HMS ''Monarch'']], the masted turret ship proposed by the 1865 committee and designed by Reed, and which was in the area at the time of the sinking, had a righting moment of 6,500-foot-tons (20&amp;nbsp;MN·m) at the same angle.&lt;ref&gt;Reed, Edward James: ''A treatise on the stability of ships.'' C. Griffin and company, 1885, page 346&lt;/ref&gt; Maximum righting moment occurred at a heel of 21 degrees, and thereafter declined to zero at 54.5 degrees. ''Monarch's'' righting moment increased to a maximum at 40 degrees.&lt;ref&gt;Padfield p. 50&lt;/ref&gt; Survivors testified that the ''Captain'' floated upside down for between three and ten minutes, which proved that the ship had capsized.&lt;ref name =harvnb/&gt; An [[inclining test]] had been carried out at Portsmouth on 29 July 1870 to allow the ship's stability characteristics to be calculated. ''Captain'' set sail on the ship's final voyage before the results of the trial were published.&lt;ref name="Brown p50"&gt;Brown 2003, p. 50.&lt;/ref&gt;

The inquiry concluded that "the ''Captain'' was built in deference to public opinion expressed in Parliament and through other channels, and in opposition to views and opinions of the Controller and his Department".&lt;ref&gt;Beeler, John Francis: ''British naval policy in the Gladstone-Disraeli era, 1866–1880.'' Stanford University Press, 1997, page 114. {{ISBN|0-8047-2981-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Memorials==
There are memorials to the crew in [[St Paul's Cathedral]], [[Westminster Abbey]], London, and St. Anne's church in Portsmouth.

The conclusion of the 1870 Court Martial is engraved upon the Memorial to the loss of H.M.S. ''Captain'', in the north aisle of St. Paul’s Cathedral.  One doubts that Captain Coles or any of those involved, from the First Lord of the Admiralty and First Sea Lord down, could have taken exception to the Inquiry’s conclusion, apportioning the blame all round as it does:

:''Before the'' Captain ''was received from her contractors a grave departure from her original design had been committed whereby her draught of water was increased about two feet and her freeboard was diminished to a corresponding extent, and that her stability proved to be dangerously small, combined with an area of sail, under those circumstances, excessive.  The Court deeply regret that if these facts were duly known and appreciated, they were not communicated to the officer in command of the ship, or that, if otherwise, the ship was allowed to be employed in the ordinary service of the Fleet before they had been ascertained by calculation and experience.''

'''Hospital San Juan de Dios''' in [[Bogotá]] houses the ''National Institute of Immunology'' ({{lang|es|[[Instituto Nacional de Inmunología]]}}) where important work on [[vaccine]]s for [[malaria]] is carried out. This is one of the oldest serving hospitals in Latin America. It was founded in 1723. It initially consisted of three buildings of republican architectural style. The main building was modeled after the [[Pasteur Institute]] in [[France]]. A more modern high-rise building was constructed in the 1960s to house the hospital, and the original buildings were left unrepaired. Dr. [[Manuel Elkin Patarroyo]] housed his lab ({{lang|es|Instituto Colombiano de Immunología}}) in the old buildings, remodeling them to their initial architectural beauty. Patarroyo's lab was one of the leading institutes in the world working on a vaccine for malaria. 

The hospital remained one of the main academic medical centers until 1999 and was the main hospital for Colombia's state medical school ({{lang|es|Universidad Nacional}}). The hospital was owned by a foundation, and after the restructuring of the medical system in Colombia to a universal private insurance capitated system, the hospital became financially insolvent because it stopped receiving direct state support. The bankruptcy of the hospital led to expropriation of its assets by lenders. All of the equipment of Patarroyo's lab was repossessed and the lab closed. Currently the hospital remains closed.

'''''I and Albert''''' is a 1972 [[musical theatre|musical]] by composer [[Charles Strouse]], and lyricist [[Lee Adams]]. The plot is based on the lives of [[Victoria of the United Kingdom|Queen Victoria]] and her husband [[Albert, Prince Consort|Prince Albert of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha]] and was adapted for the stage by [[Jay Presson Allen]].  

==Production==
The musical debuted in the [[West End theatre|West End]] at the [[Piccadilly Theatre]] on 6 November 1972, under the direction of [[John Schlesinger]], but proved a flop, running only for three months, 120 performances. British actress [[Polly James]] performed the role of Victoria opposite [[Sven-Bertil Taube]] as her husband Prince Albert.&lt;ref&gt;Suskin, Steven. ''Show Tunes:The Songs, Shows and Careers of Broadway's Major Composers'', Oxford University Press US, 2010 (Ed.4), {{ISBN|0-19-531407-7}}, p. 291&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Lewis Fiander]] and [[Aubrey Woods]] had featured roles. [[Sarah Brightman]] made her stage debut in 1973 in this musical, as Vicky, the queen's eldest daughter, and a street [[waif]], at age 13. Also in the cast was [[Simon Gipps-Kent]] as a young [[Edward VII|Prince Edward]] ("Bertie"), a role he would later reprise for television in ''[[Edward the Seventh]]''.

The musical has not been performed on [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]].

A PDF of the original program can be found at&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.infotextmanuscripts.org/webb/webb_programmes_index.html]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Jewish Culture Festival in Krakow.jpg|thumb|right|400px|"Shalom in Szeroka Street", the final concert of the 15th Jewish Festival]]
The '''Jewish Culture Festival in Kraków''' ({{lang-pl|Festiwal Kultury Żydowskiej w Krakowie}}, {{lang-yi|ייִדישער קולטור־פֿעסטיוואַל אין קראָקע}}) is an annual cultural event organized since 1988 in the once [[Jew]]ish district of [[Kazimierz]] (part of [[Kraków]]) by the Jewish Culture Festival Society headed by [[Janusz Makuch]], a self-described ''meshugeneh'', fascinated with all things Jewish.&lt;ref name=nyt07&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.nytimes.com/2007/07/12/world/europe/12krakow.html?ex=1341979200&amp;en=ceb7c359b7a7976a&amp;ei=5124&amp;partner=permalink&amp;exprod=permalink | work=The New York Times | location=Krakow | title=In Poland, a Jewish Revival Thrives — Minus Jews | first=Craig S. | last=Smith | date=12 July 2007 | accessdate=2012-03-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; The main goal of the festival is to educate people about [[Jewish culture]], history and faith (Judaism), which flourished in Poland before [[the Holocaust]], as well as to familiarize them with modern Jewish culture developing mostly in the United States and Israel, and finally, to provide entertainment.

Each festival is held in late June or early July and takes nine days, from Saturday to Sunday. During that time concerts, exhibitions, plays, lectures, workshops, tours, etc. are organized. The two most important concerts are: the inaugural concert on the first Sunday, and the final concert on the last Saturday of the festival. The former usually takes place in one of seven synagogues of Kazimierz and features [[hazzan|cantoral]] music; the latter is always held outdoors, in Ulica Szeroka, the main street of the Jewish part of Kazimierz, and features [[klezmer]] music. In between there are many more concerts, usually with some variations of [[klezmer music]].

The workshops provide an occasion to learn about traditional Jewish cuisine, dance, music, calligraphy and other aspects of Jewish culture. More about Jewish culture, as well as about topics related to the Holocaust, is taught at numerous lectures. Exhibitions of Jewish art, particularly paper-cut, are also organized. The program of the festival also includes tours of the synagogues and cemeteries of Kazimierz as well as the former [[Nazism|Nazi]]-era [[Kraków Ghetto]] in the nearby district of [[Podgórze]]. During the festival [[Gentile]]s are also invited to watch or participate in Jewish prayers at the synagogue.

Jewish Culture Festival brings together artists of Jewish culture from all over the world - music bands, soloists, choirs, jazz musicians and dance teachers. The festival promotes a whole variety of different styles of Jewish music: synagogue song, hasidic, classical, Jewish folk and – very popular in Krakow nowadays – klezmer. For the Poles this event is a way of promotion of Jewish culture and paying a homage to the community that used to live in Poland, although many Jews were reportedly offended by the commercialization of Polish Jewish culture. "Others argue that there is something deeper taking place in Poland as the country heals from the double wounds of Nazi and Communist domination."&lt;ref name=nyt07/&gt;

It is one of Poland's major annual cultural events and one of the biggest festivals of Jewish culture in the world. Artists and entertainers usually associated with the festival include: [[Benzion Miller]], Yaakov Stark, [[David Krakauer]], [[Frank London]], Leopold Kozłowski, Michael Alpert, [[Theodore Bikel]], Paul Brody and many others. Jewish dances are led by Steven Weintraub.

This is a '''list of people who disappeared mysteriously: post-1970''' and of people whose current whereabouts are unknown or whose deaths are not substantiated. Many people who disappear are eventually [[declared death in absentia|declared dead ''in absentia'']]. Some of these people were possibly subjected to [[forced disappearance]], but there is insufficient information on their subsequent fates.

&lt;!--By consensus, entries must be those of people or disappearances that are notable because an article about them already exists. Do not add an entry if you cannot link to such an article. Also, fugitives from justice including most wanted criminals or those who disappear who are suspects of a crime, and whose disappearance is related to that particular crime, should not be included unless there are special circumstances regarding the case.--&gt;

Schulze had also been seen buying prunes from the same store earlier in the day.

Acosta telephoned his son from Mazatlán, telling him that he was "about to board a boat full of white snow." Marco is later quoted in reference to his father's disappearance: "The body was never found, but we surmise that probably, knowing the people he was involved with, he ended up mouthing off, getting into a fight, and getting killed." He was also a close personal friend of the American author [[Hunter S. Thompson]]. As a travelling companion and ever-present associate of Thompson, Acosta featured heavily in Thompson's 1971 book ''[[Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas]]'', in which he was referred to as 'Dr. Gonzo' and Thompson's attorney.

|Etan Kalil Patz (October 9, 1972 – May 25, 1979; declared legally dead in 2001) was an American boy who was six years old on May 25, 1979, when he disappeared on his way to his school bus stop in the SoHo neighborhood of Lower Manhattan. His disappearance helped launch the missing children movement, which included new legislation and new methods for tracking down missing children. Several years after he disappeared, Patz was one of the first children to be profiled on the "photo on a milk carton" campaigns of the early 1980s.

The Plebeian Games may have been celebrated among the common people without an official place on the [[Roman calendar|religious calendar]] until [[nobiles|plebeians rose to positions of highest prominence]]; [[Cicero]], at least, thought they were Rome's oldest ''ludi''.&lt;ref&gt;[[Cicero]], ''[[In Verrem]]'' II.5.36; [[Mary Beard (classicist)|Mary Beard]], J.A. North, and S.R.F. Price, ''Religions of Rome: A History'' (Cambridge University Press, 1998), vol. 1, pp. 66–67.&lt;/ref&gt; They are known to have been held each year from 220 onward,&lt;ref&gt;[[Jörg Rüpke]], "Communicating with the Gods," in ''A Companion to the Roman Republic'' (Blackwell, 2010), p. 225.&lt;/ref&gt; but may have been much older.&lt;ref&gt;Davis, "Games," p. 266.&lt;/ref&gt; It may be most accurate to say the ''Ludi Plebeii'' were first established as a ''public'' festival in 220 BC.&lt;ref&gt;[[William Warde Fowler]], ''The Roman Festivals of the Period of the Republic'' (London, 1908), p. 252.&lt;/ref&gt; Because the proceedings of the Plebeian Games strikingly resemble those of the [[Ludi Romani|''Ludi Romani'' ("Roman Games")]], [[T.P. Wiseman]] has suggested that they were created by the ''plebs'' as an assertion of their own identity, perhaps as early as the 5th or 4th century BC.&lt;ref&gt;[[T.P. Wiseman]], ''Remus: A Roman Myth'' (Cambridge University Press, 1995), p. 134.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Purpose==
The ''Ludi Plebeii'' were presented by the [[plebeian aedile]]s and celebrated plebeian political liberty, but tradition varied as to freedom from what: either the [[kings of Rome|tyranny of the Tarquins]] in the [[Roman kingdom|Regal period]], or the dominance of the [[Patrician (ancient Rome)|patricians]], the hereditary ruling class of early [[Roman Republic|Republican Rome]]  (see "[[Conflict of the Orders]]").&lt;ref&gt;[[T.P. Wiseman]], "The Games of Hercules," in ''Religion in Archaic Republican Rome and Italy: Evidence and Experience'' (Edinburgh University Press, 2000), p. 112. A [[scholiast]] to [[Cicero]] offers both causes.&lt;/ref&gt; 

==Timing and location==
According to one ancient source, the games were held in the [[Circus Flaminius]], which was associated with the common people of Rome ''([[plebs]])''.&lt;ref&gt;P.J. Davis, "Games," in ''Oxford Encyclopedia of Ancient Greece and Rome'' (Oxford University Press, 2010), p. 266.&lt;/ref&gt; Nearly all other games were held in the [[Circus Maximus]]. The Circus Flaminius was built by the [[plebs|plebeian]] [[Roman censor|censor]] [[Gaius Flaminius]] in 220 BC, and the annual games may have been instituted by him that year.&lt;ref&gt;Davis, "Games," p. 266.&lt;/ref&gt; During the festival, a [[Epulum Jovis|feast of Jupiter ''(Epulum Iovis)'']] was held November 13, a cavalry parade November 14, and circus games ''([[ludi circenses]]'', mainly [[chariot races]]) November 15–17. The siting of the games at the Circus Flaminius may thus be an error,&lt;ref&gt;[[Valerius Maximus]] 1.7.4.&lt;/ref&gt; since the Circus Flaminius had no track for chariot racing.&lt;ref&gt;Wiseman, ''Remus'', p. 211.&lt;/ref&gt; A [[Pompa circensis|procession]] similar to that of the ''Ludi Romani'' is likely also to have been part of the festivities.

==Miscellanea==
[[Plautus]] first presented his comedy ''[[Stichus]]'' at the Plebeian Games of 200 BC.&lt;ref&gt;Davis, "Games," p. 266.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Livy]] notes that the ''ludi'' had to be repeated three times in 216 BC, owing to a ''[[Glossary of ancient Roman religion#vitium|vitium]]'' (ritual fault) that disrupted the correct performance of events.&lt;ref&gt;Davis, "Games," p. 266.&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="23884">The '''Marcel Bezençon Awards''' were first handed out during the [[Eurovision Song Contest 2002]] in [[Tallinn, Estonia]] honoring 
the best competing songs in the final. Founded by [[Christer Björkman]] ([[Sweden]]'s representative in the [[1992 Eurovision Song Contest]] and current Head of Delegation for Sweden) and Richard Herrey (member of the [[Herreys]], [[Eurovision Song Contest 1984]] winner from Sweden), the awards are named after the creator of the annual competition, [[Marcel Bezençon]].&lt;ref name="Bezençon"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://poplight.zitiz.se/marcelbezenconaward/en |title=Marcel Bezençon Award - an introduction |publisher=''[[Poplight]]'' |accessdate=2009-06-02 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131017033001/http://poplight.zitiz.se/marcelbezenconaward/en |archivedate=2013-10-17 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The awards are divided into 3 categories:

*'''Press Award''' - Given to the best entry as voted on by the accredited media and press during the event.
*'''Artistic Award''' - Presented to the best artist as voted on by the commentators (2010 until presently). Until 2009 as voted by previous winners
*'''Composer Award''' - A jury consisting of the participating composers vote for the best and most original composition.

In [[Eurovision Song Contest 2008|2008]], a special award was presented, the Poplight Fan Award, as voted by fans on the Swedish website ''poplight.se'' and presented to their favourite debuting artist (under age 25).&lt;ref name="Bezençon"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.esctoday.com/news/read/10840|title=Marcel Bezençon Award for fans|last=Viniker|first=Barry|date=2008-03-11|publisher=''ESCToday''|accessdate=2009-06-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2010 the Eurovision Song Contest added a new category, the commentator's vote. Previously, this category was awarded by the former winners, but logistical problems has made the organisers change the basis of the vote. It has been too difficult to get hold of past winners, and some of them don't watch the contest. On the other hand, the commentators follow the rehearsals intensely and are regarded as a more reliable group for the voting. The commentators vote for the "Artistic Awards."&lt;ref&gt;http://www.eurovision.tv/page/news?id=18433&amp;_t=Israeli+grand+slam+in+the+Marcel+Bezen%C3%A7on+Awards&lt;/ref&gt;

Although sanctioned by Eurovision Song Contest, the awards are not presented during the final event broadcast, rather they are handed out during the official contest after party. In [[Eurovision Song Contest 2009|2009]], however, the trophies were awarded prior to the event final.

Sweden's [[Melodifestivalen]] also presents the awards during their own competition proper.

===Fan Award===
The Fan Award was handed out in 2002 &amp; 2003, and voted on by the members of [[OGAE]], the Eurovision international fan club. It was discontinued and replaced by the Composer Award in 2004.

In 2008, a special award, called the Poplight Fan Award, was introduced and  was voted on by ESC fans (see above). It has not been awarded since then.

==Melodifestivalen winners==
Since 2005 [[Sveriges Television]] (SVT) has awarded Marcel Bezençon Awards during its national selection [[Melodifestivalen]]. These awards follow the same format as that for the Eurovision awards, with awards given to songs that competed in the final of the contest. Songs that won the Eurovision Song Contest are indicated in '''bold'''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://svt.se/2.79613/1.1531032/vinnare_av_marcel_bezencon_award_2009&amp;from=rss|title=Vinnare av Marcel Bezencon Award 2009|publisher=''[[Sveriges Television|SVT]]''|language=Swedish|accessdate=2009-06-28|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110613000836/http://svt.se/2.79613/1.1531032/vinnare_av_marcel_bezencon_award_2009%26from%3Drss|archivedate=2011-06-13|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Melodifestivalen 2011: Eric Saade, Danny och Nicke Borg vann Marcel Bezençon Award|url=http://poplight.zitiz.se/artikel/melodifestivalen-2011-eric-saade-danny-och-nicke-borg-vann-marcel-bezencon-award|publisher=''poplight.zitiz.se''|accessdate=14 May 2011|language=Swedish|date=2011-03-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''{{Use British English|date=November 2014}}''
'''Measurement''' is the assignment of a number to a characteristic of an object or event, which can be compared with other objects or events.&lt;ref name=pedhazur&gt;{{cite book |last1 = Pedhazur |first1 = Elazar J. |last2 = Schmelkin  |first2 = Liora Pedhazur  | title = Measurement, Design, and Analysis: An Integrated Approach | edition=1st |publisher = Lawrence Erlbaum Associates |location = Hillsdale, NJ  |year = 1991 |isbn = 978-0805810639  |pages=15–29}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = bipm&gt;{{cite book | title = International Vocabulary of Metrology – Basic and General Concepts and Associated Terms (VIM) | year = 2008 | edition = 3rd | publisher = International Bureau of Weights and Measures | url = http://www.bipm.org/utils/common/documents/jcgm/JCGM_200_2008.pdf | page = 16}}&lt;/ref&gt; The scope and application of measurement are dependent on the context and discipline. In the [[natural science]]s and [[engineering]], measurements do not apply to [[Level of measurement#Nominal scale|nominal properties]] of objects or events, which is consistent with the guidelines of the ''International vocabulary of metrology'' published by the [[International Bureau of Weights and Measures]].&lt;ref name=bipm /&gt; However, in other fields such as [[statistics]] as well as the [[Social Sciences|social]] and [[behavioral sciences]], measurements can have [[Level of measurement|multiple levels]], which would include nominal, ordinal, interval and ratio scales.&lt;ref name=pedhazur /&gt;&lt;ref name = "Koch 2008"&gt;{{cite encyclopedia | editor-last = Kirch | editor-first = Wilhelm | title = Level of measurement | encyclopedia = Encyclopedia of Public Health  | volume = 2  | pages = 81  | publisher = Springer  | date = 2008 | isbn = 978-0321021069 | accessdate = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Measurement is a cornerstone of [[trade]], [[science]], [[technology]], and [[quantitative research]] in many disciplines. Historically, many [[system of measurement|measurement systems]] existed for the varied fields of human existence to facilitate comparisons in these fields. Often these were achieved by local agreements between trading partners or collaborators. Since the 18th century, developments progressed towards unifying, widely accepted standards that resulted in the modern [[International System of Units]] (SI). This system reduces all physical measurements to a mathematical combination of seven base units. The science of measurement is pursued in the field of [[metrology]].

[[File:Measuring Tape Inch+CM.jpg|thumb|A typical [[tape measure]] with both [[Metric system|metric]] and [[imperial units|imperial]] units and two [[US penny|US pennies]] for comparison]]

==Methodology==
The measurement of a property may be categorized by the following criteria: [[level of measurement|type]], [[magnitude (mathematics)|magnitude]], [[units of measurement|unit]], and [[uncertainty]].{{citation needed|date=July 2015}} They enable unambiguous comparisons between measurements.
* The ''level'' of measurement is a taxonomy for the methodological character of a comparison. For example, two states of a property may be compared by ratio, difference, or ordinal preference. The type is commonly not explicitly expressed, but implicit in the definition of a measurement procedure.
* The ''magnitude'' is the numerical value of the characterization, usually obtained with a suitably chosen [[measuring instrument]].
* A ''unit'' assigns a mathematical weighting factor to the magnitude that is derived as a ratio to the property of an artifact used as standard or a natural physical quantity.
* An ''uncertainty'' represents the [[observational error|random and systemic errors]] of the measurement procedure; it indicates a confidence level in the measurement. Errors are evaluated by methodically repeating measurements and considering the [[accuracy and precision]] of the measuring instrument.

==Standardization of measurement units==
Measurements most commonly use the [[International System of Units]] (SI) as a comparison framework. The system defines seven [[SI base units|fundamental units]]: [[kilogram]], [[metre]], [[candela]], [[second]], [[ampere]], [[kelvin]], and [[mole (unit)|mole]]. Six of these units are defined without reference to a particular physical object which serves as a standard (artifact-free), while the kilogram is still embodied in an artifact which rests at the headquarters of the [[International Bureau of Weights and Measures]] in [[Sèvres]] near Paris. Artifact-free definitions fix measurements at an exact value related to a [[physical constant]] or other invariable phenomena in nature, in contrast to standard artifacts which are subject to deterioration or destruction. Instead, the measurement unit can only ever change through increased accuracy in determining the value of the constant it is tied to.

[[File:SI base unit.svg|thumb|right|The seven base units in the SI system. Arrows point from units to those that depend on them.]]

The first proposal to tie an SI base unit to an experimental standard independent of fiat was by [[Charles Sanders Peirce]] (1839–1914),&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Crease|2011|pp=182–4}}&lt;/ref&gt; who proposed to define the metre in terms of the [[wavelength]] of a [[spectral line]].&lt;ref&gt;C.S. Peirce (July 1879) "Note on the Progress of Experiments for Comparing a Wave-length with a Metre" ''American Journal of Science'', as referenced by {{harvnb|Crease|2011|p=203 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This directly influenced the [[Michelson–Morley experiment]]; Michelson and Morley cite Peirce, and improve on his method.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Crease|2011|p=203}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Standards===
With the exception of a few fundamental [[quantum]] constants, units of measurement are derived from historical agreements. Nothing inherent in nature dictates that an [[inch]] has to be a certain length, nor that a [[mile]] is a better measure of distance than a [[kilometre]]. Over the course of human history, however, first for convenience and then for necessity, standards of measurement evolved so that communities would have certain common benchmarks. Laws regulating measurement were originally developed to prevent fraud in commerce.

[[Units of measurement]] are generally defined on a scientific basis, overseen by governmental or independent agencies, and established in international treaties, pre-eminent of which is the [[General Conference on Weights and Measures]] (CGPM), established in 1875 by the [[Metre Convention]], overseeing the International System of Units (SI) and having custody of the [[Kilogram#International prototype kilogram|International Prototype Kilogram]].  The metre, for example, was redefined in 1983 by the CGPM in terms of light speed, while in 1960 the international yard was defined by the governments of the United States, United Kingdom, Australia and South Africa as being ''exactly'' 0.9144 metres.

In the United States, the National Institute of Standards and Technology ([[NIST]]), a division of the [[United States Department of Commerce]], regulates commercial measurements. In the United Kingdom, the role is performed by the [[National Physical Laboratory (United Kingdom)|National Physical Laboratory]] (NPL), in Australia by the [[National Measurement Institute, Australia|National Measurement Institute]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.measurement.gov.au/Pages/about.aspx |title=About Us |website=National Measurement Institute of Australia}}&lt;/ref&gt; in South Africa by the [[Council for Scientific and Industrial Research]] and in India the [[National Physical Laboratory of India]].

==Units and systems==
{{Main|Units of measurement|Systems of measurement}}

[[File:FourMetricInstruments.JPG|thumb|upright|Four measuring devices having metric calibrations]]

===Imperial and US customary systems===
{{Main|Imperial and US customary measurement systems}}
Before [[SI unit]]s were widely adopted around the world, the British systems of [[English unit]]s and later [[imperial unit]]s were used in Britain, the [[Commonwealth of Nations|Commonwealth]] and the United States.  The system came to be known as [[U.S. customary units]] in the United States and is still in use there and in a few [[Caribbean]] countries.  These various systems of measurement have at times been called ''foot-pound-second'' systems after the Imperial units for length, weight and time even though the tons, hundredweights, gallons, and nautical miles, for example, are different for the U.S. units.  Many Imperial units remain in use in Britain, which has officially switched to the SI system—with a few exceptions such as road signs, which are still in miles. Draught beer and cider must be sold by the imperial pint, and milk in returnable bottles can be sold by the imperial pint. Many people measure their height in feet and inches and their weight in [[Stone (imperial mass)|stone]] and pounds, to give just a few examples. Imperial units are used in many other places, for example, in many Commonwealth countries that are considered metricated, land area is measured in acres and floor space in square feet, particularly for commercial transactions (rather than government statistics). Similarly, gasoline is sold by the gallon in many countries that are considered metricated.

===Metric system===
The [[metric system]] is a decimal [[system of measurement]] based on its units for length, the metre and for mass, the kilogram. It exists in several variations, with different choices of [[Units of measurement#Base and derived units|base units]], though these do not affect its day-to-day use. Since the 1960s, the International System of Units (SI) is the internationally recognised metric system. Metric units of mass, length, and electricity are widely used around the world for both everyday and scientific purposes.

The metric system features a single base unit for many physical quantities. Other quantities are derived from the standard SI units.  Multiples and fractions are expressed as [[powers of 10]] of each unit. When smaller or larger units are more convenient for given use, [[metric prefix]]es can be added to the base unit to denote its multiple by a power of ten: a thousandth (10&lt;sup&gt;−3&lt;/sup&gt;) of a metre is a ''milli''metre, while a thousand (10&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;) metres is a ''kilo''metre. Unit conversions are thus always simple, so that convenient magnitudes for measurements are achieved by simply moving the decimal place: 1.234 metres is 1234 millimetres or 0.001234 kilometres. The use of [[Fraction (mathematics)|fractions]], such as 2/5 of a metre, is not prohibited, but uncommon. There is no profusion of different units with different conversion factors as in the Imperial system which uses, for example, inches, feet, yards, [[fathom]]s, and [[Rod (unit)|rods]] for length.

===International System of Units===
The [[International System of Units]] (abbreviated as SI from the [[French language]] name ''Système International d'Unités'') is the modern revision of the [[metric system]]. It is the world's most widely used [[system of units]], both in everyday [[commerce]] and in [[science]]. The SI was developed in 1960 from the metre-kilogram-[[second]] (MKS) system, rather than the [[centimetre gram second system of units|centimetre-gram-second]] (CGS) system, which, in turn, had many variants. During its development the SI also introduced several newly named units that were previously not a part of the metric system. The original SI units for the seven basic physical quantities were:&lt;ref&gt;{{SIbrochure8th|page = 147}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[mole (unit)|mole]] was subsequently added to this list and the degree Kelvin renamed the kelvin.

There are two types of SI units, base units and derived units.  Base units are the simple measurements for time, length, mass, temperature, amount of substance, electric current and light intensity.  Derived units are constructed from the base units, for example, the [[watt]], i.e. the unit for power, is defined from the base units as m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;·kg·s&lt;sup&gt;−3&lt;/sup&gt;. Other physical properties may be measured in compound units, such as material density, measured in kg/m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;.

====Converting prefixes====
The SI allows easy multiplication when switching among units having the same base but different prefixes. To convert from metres to centimetres it is only necessary to multiply the number of metres by 100, since there are 100 centimetres in a metre. Inversely, to switch from centimetres to metres one multiplies the number of centimetres by 0.01 or divide centimetres by 100.

===Length===
[[File:CarpentersRule.png|thumb|right|A 2-metre carpenter's [[ruler]]]]
{{See also|List of length, distance, or range measuring devices}}

A [[ruler]] or rule is a tool used in, for example, [[geometry]], [[technical drawing]], engineering, and carpentry, to measure lengths or distances or to draw straight lines.  Strictly speaking, the ''ruler'' is the instrument used to '''rule''' straight lines and the calibrated instrument used for determining length is called a ''measure'', however common usage calls both instruments ''rulers'' and the special name ''straightedge'' is used for an unmarked rule.  The use of the word ''measure'', in the sense of a measuring instrument, only survives in the phrase ''tape measure'', an instrument that can be used to measure but cannot be used to draw straight lines.  As can be seen in the photographs on this page, a two-metre carpenter's rule can be folded down to a length of only 20 centimetres, to easily fit in a pocket, and a five-metre-long tape measure easily retracts to fit within a small housing.

===Some special names===
Some non-systematic names are applied for some multiples of some units.
* 100 kilograms = 1 quintal; 1000 kilogram = 1 metric tonne;
* 10 years = 1 decade; 100 years = 1 century; 1000 years = 1 millennium

===Building trades===
The Australian building trades adopted the [[metric system]] in 1966 and the units used for measurement of length are [[metres]] (m) and [[millimetres]] (mm). [[Centimetres]] (cm) are avoided as they cause confusion when reading [[plans]]. For example, the length two and a half metres is usually recorded as 2500&amp;nbsp;mm or 2.5&amp;nbsp;m; it would be considered non-standard to record this length as 250&amp;nbsp;cm.{{citation needed|date=September 2017}}

===Surveyor's trade===
American surveyors use a decimal-based system of measurement devised by [[Edmund Gunter]] in 1620. The base unit is [[Gunter's chain]] of {{convert|66|ft|m}} which is subdivided into 4 rods, each of 16.5&amp;nbsp;ft or 100 links of 0.66&amp;nbsp;feet.  A link is abbreviated "lk,"  and links "lks" in old deeds and land surveys done for the government.

===Time===
{{Main|Time}}

Time is an abstract measurement of elemental changes over a non spatial continuum.  It is denoted by numbers and/or named periods such as [[hour]]s, [[day]]s, [[week]]s, [[month]]s and [[year]]s. It is an apparently irreversible series of occurrences within this non spatial continuum.  It is also used to denote an interval between two relative points on this continuum.

===Mass===
{{Main|Weighing scale}}

''Mass'' refers to the intrinsic property of all material objects to resist changes in their momentum.  ''Weight'', on the other hand, refers to the downward force produced when a mass is in a gravitational field.  In [[free fall]], (no net gravitational forces) objects lack weight but retain their mass.  The Imperial units of mass include the [[ounce]], [[pound (mass)|pound]], and [[ton]].  The metric units [[gram]] and kilogram are units of mass.

One device for measuring weight or mass is called a weighing scale or, often, simply a ''scale''.  A spring scale measures force but not mass, a balance compares weight, both require a gravitational field to operate.  Some of the most accurate instruments for measuring weight or mass are based on load cells with a digital read-out, but require a gravitational field to function and would not work in free fall.

===Economics===
{{Main|Measurement in economics}}
The measures used in economics are physical measures, [[nominal price]] value measures and [[real price]] measures. These measures differ from one another by the variables they measure and by the variables excluded from measurements.

===Survey research===
{{Main|Survey methodology }}
In the field of survey research, measures are taken from individual attitudes, values, and behavior using [[questionnaire]]s as a measurement instrument. As all other measurements, measurement in survey research is also vulnerable to [[Observational error|measurement error]], i.e. the departure from the true value of the measurement and the value provided using the measurement instrument.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Groves | first = Robert | title = Survey Methodology | publisher = Wiley | location = New Jersey | year = 2004 | isbn =  }} "By measurement error we mean a departure from the value of the measurement as applied to a sample unit and the value provided. "  pp. 51–52 .&lt;/ref&gt; In substantive survey research, measurement error can lead to biased conclusions and wrongly estimated effects. In order to get accurate results, when measurement errors appear, the results need to be [[Correction for attenuation|corrected for measurement errors]].

==Difficulties==
{{Unreferenced section|date=July 2017}}
Since accurate measurement is essential in many fields, and since all measurements are necessarily approximations, a great deal of effort must be taken to make measurements as accurate as possible. For example, consider the [[History of timekeeping devices|problem of measuring the time]] it takes an object to fall a distance of one metre (about 39&amp;nbsp;[[Inch|in]]).  Using physics, it can be shown that, in the gravitational field of the Earth, it should take any object about 0.45 second to fall one metre. However, the following are just some of the sources of [[measurement uncertainty|error]] that arise:
* This computation used for the [[Gravity of Earth|acceleration of gravity]] {{convert|9.8|m/s2}}. But this measurement is not exact, but only precise to two significant digits.
* The Earth's gravitational field varies slightly depending on height above sea level and other factors.
* The computation of .45 seconds involved extracting a [[square root]], a [[mathematical operation]] that required rounding off to some number of significant digits, in this case two significant digits.

Additionally, other sources of [[experimental error]] include:
* carelessness,
* determining of the exact time at which the object is released and the exact time it hits the ground,
* measurement of the height and the measurement of the time both involve some error,
* [[Air resistance]].
* posture of human participants&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Gill|first1=Simeon|last2=Parker|first2=Christopher J.|title=Scan posture definition and hip girth measurement: the impact on clothing design and body scanning|journal=Ergonomics|date=2017|volume=60|issue=8|pages=1123–1136|doi=10.1080/00140139.2016.1251621|pmid=27764997|url=https://dspace.lboro.ac.uk/2134/33471}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Scientific experiments must be carried out with great care to eliminate as much error as possible, and to keep error estimates realistic.

==Definitions and theories==

===Classical definition===
In the classical definition, which is standard throughout the physical sciences, ''measurement'' is the determination or estimation of ratios of quantities.&lt;ref name="Michell, J. 1999"&gt;Michell, J. (1999). Measurement in psychology: a critical history of a methodological concept. New York: Cambridge University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; Quantity and measurement are mutually defined: quantitative attributes are those possible to measure, at least in principle. The classical concept of quantity can be traced back to [[John Wallis]] and [[Isaac Newton]], and was foreshadowed in [[Euclid's Elements]].&lt;ref name="Michell, J. 1999"/&gt;

===Representational theory===
In the representational theory, ''measurement'' is defined as "the correlation of numbers with entities that are not numbers".&lt;ref&gt;Ernest Nagel: "Measurement", Erkenntnis, Volume 2, Number 1 / December 1931, pp.&amp;nbsp;313–335, published by [[Axel Springer AG|Springer]], the Netherlands&lt;/ref&gt; The most technically elaborated form of representational theory is also known as [[additive conjoint measurement]]. In this form of representational theory, numbers are assigned based on correspondences or similarities between the structure of number systems and the structure of qualitative systems. A property is quantitative if such structural similarities can be established. In weaker forms of representational theory, such as that implicit within the work of [[Stanley Smith Stevens]],&lt;ref&gt;Stevens, S.S. ''On the theory of scales and measurement'' 1946. Science. 103, 677–80.&lt;/ref&gt; numbers need only be assigned according to a rule.

The concept of measurement is often misunderstood as merely the assignment of a value, but it is possible to assign a value in a way that is not a measurement in terms of the requirements of additive conjoint measurement.  One may assign a value to a person's height, but unless it can be established that there is a correlation between measurements of height and empirical relations, it is not a measurement according to additive conjoint measurement theory. Likewise, computing and assigning arbitrary values, like the "book value" of an asset in accounting, is not a measurement because it does not satisfy the necessary criteria.

Three type of Representational theory

'''1) Empirical relation'''

In science, an '''empirical relationship''' is a '''relationship''' or correlation based solely on [[observation]] rather than theory. An '''empirical relationship''' requires only confirmatory data irrespective of theoretical basis

'''2) The rule of mapping'''

The real world is the Domain of mapping, and the mathematical world is the range. when we map the attribute to mathematical system, we have many choice for mapping and the range

'''3) The representation condition of measurement'''

===Information theory===
[[Information theory]] recognises that all data are inexact and statistical in nature.  Thus the definition of measurement is: "A set of observations that reduce uncertainty where the result is expressed as a quantity."&lt;ref&gt;Douglas Hubbard: "How to Measure Anything", Wiley (2007), p. 21&lt;/ref&gt;  This definition is implied in what scientists actually do when they measure something and report both the [[mean]] and [[statistics]] of the measurements.  In practical terms, one begins with an initial guess as to the expected value of a quantity, and then, using various methods and instruments, reduces the uncertainty in the value.  Note that in this view, unlike the [[positivist]] representational theory, all measurements are uncertain, so instead of assigning one value, a range of values is assigned to a measurement.  This also implies that there is not a clear or neat distinction between [[Approximation|estimation]] and measurement.

===Quantum mechanics===
In [[quantum mechanics]], a measurement is an action that determines a particular property (position, momentum, energy, etc.) of a quantum system. Before a measurement is made, a quantum system is simultaneously described by all values in a [[spectrum]], or [[range (mathematics)|range]], of possible values, where the probability of measuring each value is determined by the [[wavefunction]] of the system. When a measurement is performed, the wavefunction of the quantum system "[[wavefunction collapse|collapses]]" to a single, definite value.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Penrose | first = Roger | title = The road to reality : a complete guide to the laws of the universe | publisher = Vintage Books | location = New York | year = 2007 | isbn = 978-0679776314 }} "The jumping of the quantum state to one of the eigenstates of '''Q''' is the process referred to as ''state-vector reduction'' or ''collapse of the wavefunction''.  It is one of quantum theory's most puzzling features&amp;nbsp;..."  "[T]he way in which quantum mechanics is used in practice is to take the state indeed to jump in this curious way whenever a measurement is deemed to take place." p 528 Later Chapter 29 is entitled the Measurement paradox.&lt;/ref&gt; The unambiguous meaning of the [[measurement problem]] is an unresolved fundamental problem in [[quantum mechanics]].{{Citation needed|date=November 2010}}

'''''Mot Dag''''' ({{IPA-no|ˈmuːt ˈdɑːɡ|lang}}, ''Towards Today'') was a [[Norway|Norwegian]] political group. The group was active from the 1920s to the early 1930s and was first affiliated with the [[Labour Party (Norway)|Labor Party]]. After [[World War II]], many of its former members were leaders in Norwegian politics and cultural activities.
&lt;ref name=snl&gt;{{cite web|url = https://snl.no/Mot_Dag|title=Mot Dag|publisher = Store norske leksikon  |author=Knut Dørum|accessdate= May 1, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History and profile==
It was established in 1921 under the initiative of [[Erling Falk]] (1887-1940), partly with origins in the debate forum in the Social Democratic Student Association   (''Den Socialdemokratiske Studenterforening'') at the [[University of Oslo]]; partly from a Falk-led [[study circle]] which from 1919 involved [[Viggo Hansteen]], [[Axel Sømme]], and [[Arnold Hazeland]]. Members were strongly linked to Falk's personality  and were subject to strict discipline. The magazine ''Mot Dag''  was published by the  group between 1921 and 1936. The first [[editing|editor]] was future author and publishing consultant [[Sigurd Hoel]] (1890-1960).
&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = https://nbl.snl.no/Erling_Falk|title=Erling Falk|publisher = Norsk biografisk leksikon|author=Harald Berntsen
|accessdate= May 1, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url =https://snl.no/Sigurd_Hoel  |title=Sigurd Hoel|publisher =  Store norske leksikon   |author= Erik Bjerck Hagen
|accessdate= May 1, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Mot Dag was a collective member of the [[Norwegian Labour Party]] from March 1922 until August 1924, but was excluded after a series of disagreements. In 1927, Mot Dag was a part of the [[Norwegian Communist Party]] (NKP). From 1929, Mot Dag was an independent political organization. In the middle of the 1930s, Mot Dag made an unsuccessful attempt to establish a new labor party. After the charismatic leader Erling Falk fell sick,  [[Trond Hegna]] (1898–1992), took over the actual leadership.  Hegna  would later serve a member of the [[Norwegian Parliament]] (''Storting'') and leader of the [[Storting]]'s finance committee.
&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = https://lokalhistoriewiki.no/wiki/Mot_Dag|title=   Mot Dag |publisher = lokalhistoriewiki|accessdate= May 1, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1930, the publishing house [[Fram forlag]] was established  in part to publish  the workers' encyclopedia (''[[Arbeidernes Leksikon]]''. 1933).  Both the magazine and organization dissolved in 1936.  The organization had at most approximately 200 members and  when it was dissolved in 1936 had about 100. Most of the members followed the internal orders to register in the Labor Party. 
&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url =http://partileksikon.blogspot.com/2009/01/mot-dag.html |title=   Mot Dag|publisher = Norsk partipolitisk leksikon

After [[World War II]], many  former members Mot Dag were leaders in Norwegian politics and culture. Norway's first three post-war Prime Ministers [[Einar Gerhardsen]], [[Oscar Torp]], and [[John Lyng]] were all at one point in time part of Mot Dag. In addition were [[Gro Harlem Brundtland]]'s father, Secretary of Defense [[Gudmund Harlem]]; the Labor Party's longstanding secretary [[Haakon Lie]], Oslo's longstanding mayor [[Brynjulf Bull]], and future West German chancellor [[Willy Brandt]].
Many well-known authors, intellectuals, and future leading politicians and officials were also members. Of note were filmmaker [[Olav Dalgard]]; the authors [[Helge Krog]], [[Odd Eidem]], Sigurd Hoel, [[Arnulf Øverland]], [[Nic Waal]] and [[Inger Hagerup]] -- the latter two of the few women who were connected to Mot Dag; future director of Norway's military intelligence [[Vilhelm Evang]] and future director of the [[Norwegian Board of Health Supervision|Norwegian Directorate for Health]],  [[Karl Evang]].   Economist and future university professor  [[Johan Vogt]], who together with Falk, was behind the first translation of ''[[Das Kapital]]'' into Norwegian.

[[Constable#United Kingdom and the Commonwealth|PC]] '''Brian John Bishop''' (24 July 1947 – 27 August 1984) was a British police officer who was shot in the head by an armed robber in [[Frinton-on-Sea]], Essex, on 22 August 1984. He died from his injuries five days later in a London hospital.

==Background==
Brian Bishop joined the former [[Essex Police|Essex Constabulary]] in 1962 as a fifteen-year-old cadet. Bishop was 6&amp;nbsp;ft 7 in tall when he became [[Constable#United Kingdom and the Commonwealth|PC]] 389 on 11 August 1966 and was posted to [[Colchester]]. He joined the [[Police dog|dog section]] as a handler in 1968 and moved to the Force Support Unit in 1975. Later, he became a firearms instructor. He had been assigned to the rank of Acting Police Sergeant before he died.

==Death==
The [[epitaph]] next to Bishop's memorial stone summarises the circumstances surrounding his death as follows:

{{Quote|Brian Bishop, a member of the Essex Police tactical firearms group, was called here to await the return of an armed robber to collect stolen money which he had hidden following post office raids in [[Walton-on-the-Naze|Walton]] and [[Frinton-on-Sea|Frinton]]. Brian challenged the suspect who immediately opened fire causing extensive head injuries from which Brian subsequently died. A man was convicted of his murder.}}

Five days after the shooting in Central Avenue near Frinton's seafront took place, Bishop died at [[St Bartholomew's Hospital|St. Bartholomew's Hospital]] in [[Smithfield, London]], on 27 August 1984. His colleague [[Sergeant#Police 7|Police Sergeant]] Mervyn Fairweather, who was shot in the groin in the same incident, later recovered.

==Conviction==
Colin Richards, a 35-year-old man from [[Brentwood, Essex|Brentwood]], was arrested at the scene&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Murderered &amp;#91;sic&amp;#93; cop's widow's pride in their son the policeman|author=Emily Parsons|date=16 September 2009|newspaper=Daily Gazette|url=http://www.gazette-news.co.uk/news/4630312.My_Brian_was_killed_on_duty__Now_our_son_is_a_policeman__too/|access-date=9 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; after another of Bishop's colleagues returned fire. Richards's injuries resulted in [[paralysis]] from the waist downwards. He was found guilty of Bishop's [[Murder in English law|murder]] and of [[Grievous bodily harm|wounding]] Fairweather (having been charged with the latter's [[attempted murder]]) at [[Norwich]] [[Crown Court]] on 19 July 1985, and was sentenced to [[life imprisonment]] with a minimum tariff of 20 years.

==Memorial==
On 19 February 1986 the then [[Home Secretary]], [[Douglas Hurd]], unveiled a brown granite memorial stone adjacent to the seafront site where Bishop was shot. Bishop's memorial was only the third to be funded and erected by the [[Police Memorial Trust]], and was the first to be sited outside London.

[[File:NaturVisionPublikum.jpg|thumb|Audience at the NaturVision festival 2014]]
'''NaturVision''' is Germany’s oldest nature, wildlife and environmental film festival. Launched in 2002 in [[Neuschönau]] in the [[Bavarian Forest]], the festival moved to its new home of [[Ludwigsburg]] in the German state of [[Baden-Württemberg]] in 2012. The venue is the Central Theater Ludwigsburg. Since 2014 the festival has also offered a free open-air cinema, a market with regional and sustainable vendors and a science slam.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://festival.natur-vision.de/de/filmfestival/rahmenprogramm/naturvision-science-slam.html|title=NaturVision Science Slam - NaturVision - Internationales Natur-, Tier- und Umweltfilmfestival|website=festival.natur-vision.de|access-date=2016-09-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.scienceslam.de/dritter-naturvision-scienceslam.html|title=Dritter NaturVision Science Slam|last=|first=|date=|website=ScienceSlam.de|publisher=|access-date=2016-09-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.wildlife-film.com/-/NaturVision.htm|title=Wildlife-film.com Profile Page - NaturVision Film Festival|website=www.wildlife-film.com|access-date=2016-09-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== The Festival ==

=== Film competition ===
At the heart of the festival is the international film competition. As well as nature and wildlife films, the NaturVision festival focuses heavily on environmental and sustainability issues. As well as the "German Conservation and Sustainability Film Award", the "German Wildlife Film Award" and the "German Biodiversity Film Award" are presented at the NaturVision award ceremony, where additional prize categories include camera work, dramatisation, film music, children’s film and the audience award.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.nationalgeographic.de/aktuelles/tipps-termine/naturvision-kroent-seine-sieger|title=National Geographic Deutschland: NaturVision krönt seine Sieger|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=|access-date=2016-09-26|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160927150643/http://www.nationalgeographic.de/aktuelles/tipps-termine/naturvision-kroent-seine-sieger|archivedate=2016-09-27|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Special theme ===
Each year the festival is devoted to a special theme, which is presented in films, talks and special events. In recent years, themes have included "Soil &amp; Water" and renewable energy. In 2015 it was planned to seek and present in particular solutions for global problems in a multi-year cycle under the slogan "Islands of the Future".

=== Environmental education ===
Another area in which the NaturVision Film Festival is active is educating young people about the environment. So for instance, in the run-up to the festival, many schools in Baden-Württemberg run programmes to which experts or filmmakers are invited. At the "Film &amp; Discussion" youth media workshops, experts show films about sustainability issues to the school classes, while teachers’ workshops explain the basics of media work with children and young people. As well as the school programme and childcare facilities, the festival also puts on a children’s film programme for all age groups.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://festival.natur-vision.de/en/filmfestival/film-program.html|title=Film program - NaturVision - International nature, animal and environmental film festival|website=festival.natur-vision.de|access-date=2016-09-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the film competition a separate youth jury chooses its favourites and announces them at the grand gala award ceremony.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://festival.natur-vision.de/en/filmfestival/festival-photos.html|title=Festival photos - NaturVision - International nature, animal and environmental film festival|website=festival.natur-vision.de|access-date=2016-09-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; To ensure that it can also campaign on the cultural policy level for environmental education to be provided through the festival, NaturVision also became one of the founding members of the Association of Bavarian Film Festivals in 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.kurzfilmwoche.de/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/PM_Verbandsgru%CC%88ndung_14.01.2014.pdf|title=Pressemitteilung 14. Januar 2014: Gründung Verband der bayerischen Filmfestivals|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Industry Networking and Best-Of Events ===
Apart from the festival serving as a platform for NGOs focused on environmental topics,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.stuttgart.greenpeace.de/artikel/naturvision-filmfestival-2015|title=NaturVision Filmfestival 2015|last=|first=|date=|website=Greenpeace Stuttgart|publisher=|access-date=2016-09-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; it also especially acts as meet up point for people in the film industry, offering workshops and opportunities for filmmakers, media representatives and other cultural creators to get together. Producers and filmmakers have the chance to engage with each other and the public. One of NaturVision’s objectives is to support and promote the genre of nature and environmental film. One strategy for this is Best-Of events assembled from last year's program, which take place primarily in Switzerland.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.jagdnatur.ch/naturama-filmtage/|title=Naturama Filmtage - Jagd &amp; Natur|website=www.jagdnatur.ch|access-date=2016-09-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Photographic competition "Europe’s Natural Treasures" ===
Together with Euronatur, natur magazine and [[Gelsenwasser]], NaturVision sponsors the photography competition "Europe’s Natural Treasures", the results of which are compiled each year in the "Fascination of Nature" exhibition, which can be seen in various locations.

== History ==
[[File:NaturVision-2014-07-24.MB--0302.jpg|thumb|Festival director Ralph Thoms on NaturVision's official green carpet.]]
NaturVision was founded in 2002 by Ralph Thoms and was held annually in the [[Bavarian Forest National Park]] in Neuschönau, Germany. Because of the venue’s proximity to the Czech border, the festival has enjoyed a collaboration with the Czech town of [[Vimperk]] since its early days.

Already in 2008 – as part of the German-Chinese Year of Science and Education&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.dcjwb.net/_media/DCJWB-Abschlussbericht_DE.pdf|title=Abschlussbericht des Deutsch-Chinesischen Jahres der Wissenschaft und Bildung|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=Bundesministerium für Forschung und Bildung 2009/2010|access-date=2015-03-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; – a collaboration with China was established, and German and Chinese filmmakers interacted for the first time in the workshops of the NaturVision Film Festival.

In 2012 the festival changed locations for financial reasons&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.regiowiki.pnp.de/index.php/|title=NaturVision NaturVision Beitrag auf RegioWiki – Niederbayern und Altötting|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and was relaunched in Ludwigsburg in the German state of Baden-Württemberg. In the metropolitan area around [[Stuttgart]], it has grown steadily since then&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.stuttgarter-nachrichten.de/inhalt.ludwigsburg-filmfestival-natur-vision-beginnt.69e7259d-166e-4cae-9d88-d19af9037a23.html|title=Filmfestival "NaturVision" beginnt|last=|first=|date=2013-07-18|website=Stuttgarter Nachrichten|publisher=|access-date=2016-09-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; and recorded over 13,000 visitors in 2016. The festival venue is the Central Theater Ludwigsburg, but the extensive supporting programme is spread over the whole city – from the open-air cinema in Arsenalplatz to the NaturVision Science Slam, which took place in the Film Gallery of the [[Film Academy Baden-Württemberg|Filmakademie Baden-Württemberg]] in 2015.

The Bavarian Forest, meanwhile, is home to the NaturVision Film Days, which have been held in the Hans-Eisenmann-Haus in Neuschönau since 2012. Here, as well as the highlights of the Ludwigsburg festival, visitors can enjoy films that are of special interest for the region in the ''HeimatSachen'' series. What makes the Film Days so special is the location’s proximity to nature, with films ''about'' nature being presented ''in'' nature – or rather, in an open-air cinema set up in the forest. NaturVision’s youth environmental education efforts continue in the Bavarian Forest, with the ideas competition "Educational film: Naturally!" organised jointly with Bayernwerk AG, and a school programme before and during the contest inviting pupils to find out more about the environment and sustainability.

== Patron and supporters ==
Patron of the NaturVision Film Festival for the last two years has been Baden-Württemberg’s premier [[Winfried Kretschmann]] (of political party [[Alliance '90/The Greens|Alliance ’90/The Greens]]). For him the main focus of NaturVision is educating people about the environment:&lt;blockquote&gt;“The nature film festival NaturVision in Ludwigsburg marks an important intersection between media and environmental education. This is where passion for film and nature meet.” – Winfried Kretschmann&lt;/blockquote&gt;Another champion of the festival is German actor Andreas Hoppe, best known for his role as a police inspector in the popular TV crime series ''[[Tatort]]''. He campaigns for animal welfare and the use of regional foods. Another celebrity guest and supporter of the festival is actor [[Hannes Jaenicke]], whose production "Hannes Jaenicke in Action for …." was awarded the first "NaturVision Film Festival Special Prize" in 2014.

Three Germany based media outlets have been the official presenters of the festival since 2015: the German subsidiary of [[Discovery Channel]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.discovery.de/naturvision/|title=NaturVision Gewinnspiel|last=|first=|date=|website=Discovery Channel|publisher=|access-date=2016-09-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; the German-French culture channel [[arte]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.arte.tv/sites/de/das-arte-magazin/2016/06/24/verlosung-juli-bewegte-natur/|title=Verlosung Juli: Bewegte Natur|last=|first=|date=|website=arte Magazin|publisher=|access-date=2016-09-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Ludwigsburg's local newspaper [[Ludwigsburger Kreiszeitung]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.lkz.de/bildergalerien/bilder-stadt-landkreis_galerie,-NaturVision-Filmfestival-2016-_mediagalid,679.html|title=NaturVision Filmfestival 2016|last=|first=|date=|website=Ludwigsburger Kreiszeitung|publisher=|access-date=2016-09-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Lead too short|date=December 2018}}

The so-called '''Nazi gold train''' and '''Wałbrzych gold train''' concerns a local [[legend]] of a [[Nazi Germany]]-era train buried in a tunnel underground in [[Lower Silesia]] in January 1945 toward the end of [[World War II]].&lt;ref name="day"/&gt; The area is now part of southwest [[Poland]], but was then in southeast Germany. Many searches for the train have been conducted since World War II, with no evidence of a train found. 

A search in 2015–2016 received global media interest, culminating in a dig involving the Polish military, local and state officials, but turned up only dirt. According to historians, it has never been proven the train ever existed.

==Legend==
The train is believed to be near the Polish city of [[Wałbrzych]], which until 1945 was the German city of Waldenburg.

According to local legend, the train left Breslau (now [[Wrocław]]) laden with gold and other treasures. It was driven into a system of tunnels under the [[Owl Mountains]] that were part of an unfinished [[Nazi]] secret [[Project Riese]] ([[German language|German]] for "giant")&lt;ref name="usatoday"&gt;{{cite news |url= https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/world/2015/08/20/nazi-train-treasure-claimed-found-poland/32050431/ |title=Men claim to find Nazi train loaded with treasure in Poland |author=[[Associated Press]] |newspaper=[[USA Today]] |publisher=[[Gannett Company]] |date=August 20, 2015 |access-date=2015-08-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; near Wałbrzych. There it was buried in a warren of tunnels and mines created by the Nazis. The train is rumoured to hold up to 300 tonnes of gold, jewels, weapons, and masterpieces.&lt;ref name="guard"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/aug/28/nazi-gold-train-deathbed-confession-may-have-revealed-location |title=Deathbed confession may have revealed location of 'Nazi gold train' |author-last=Elgot |author-first=Jessica |newspaper=[[The Guardian]] |publisher=[[Guardian Media Group]] |date=August 28, 2015 |access-date=2015-09-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="bbc"&gt;{{cite news |url= https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-34090165 |title=Poland radar image 'almost certainly Nazi train' |work=[[BBC News]] |publisher=[[BBC]] |date=August 28, 2015 |access-date=2015-09-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="dailymail"&gt;{{cite news |url= http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-3215299/Nazi-gold-train-contain-ornate-250m-Amber-Room-given-Tsar-Peter-Great-King-Prussia-missing-looted-WWII.html |author-last=Drury |author-first=Flora |title=Nazi gold train may contain 'Amber Room' given by Tsar Peter the Great to King of Prussia |newspaper=[[Daily Mail]] |publisher=[[DMG Media]] |date=August 29, 2015 |access-date=2015-08-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Searches==

In the [[Polish People's Republic]] (1947-1989), the [[Polish Armed Forces]] carried out fruitless searches for the train.&lt;ref name="gitau"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://news.yahoo.com/deathbed-confession-reveals-location-nazi-train-might-contain-180554920.html |title=Deathbed confession reveals location of Nazi train that might contain gold |work=[[Yahoo!

On 28 August, Polish Deputy Culture Minister [[Piotr Żuchowski]] announced that [[ground-penetrating radar]] images taken by Koper and Richter confirmed with 99% probability that a train of 100 metres in length had been found.&lt;ref name="gitau"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Generalny Konserwator Zabytków potwierdza istnienie ukrytego pociągu |url=http://mkidn.gov.pl/pages/posts/generalny-konserwator-zabytkow-potwierdza-istnienie-ukrytego-pociagu-5705.php |publisher= Ministerstwo Kultury i Dziedzictwa Narodowego |date=August 28, 2015 |access-date=2015-09-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, on August 31, [[Tomasz Smolarz]], [[Voivode|Governor]] of the [[Lower Silesian Voivodeship]], told reporters that "There is no more proof for this alleged discovery than for other claims made over the years," saying, "It's impossible to claim that such a find actually exists at the location indicated based on the documents that have been submitted."&lt;ref name="backtrack"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://news.yahoo.com/poland-backtracks-nazi-gold-train-discovery-134655267.html |title=Poland backtracks on Nazi 'gold train' discovery |publisher=[[Yahoo!

On 4 September, Koper and Richter went public for the first time, breaking their previous anonymity. They announced that the precise location of the train had been given to Polish authorities.&lt;ref name="gani"/&gt; In a bid to assuage doubters,&lt;ref name="wight"/&gt; they also released images they had taken with a [[KS-700]] Ground Penetrating Radar system that appeared to show a 50-metre-deep man-made shaft with something in it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author-last=Day |author-first=Matthew |title=Polish soldiers seal off 'Nazi gold train' location as finders reveal their 'clear evidence' |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/europe/poland/11843875/Polish-soldiers-seal-off-Nazi-gold-train-location-as-finders-reveal-their-clear-evidence.html |website=The Telegraph |date=September 4, 2015 |access-date=2015-09-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; Koper and Richter believed the train was buried next to a {{convert|4|km|sing=on|abbr=off}} stretch of track on [[Polish State Railways]]' Wrocław–Wałbrzych line at kilometre 65.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/europe/poland/11830226/Nazi-gold-train-found-live.html |author-last=Alexander |author-first=Harriet |title=Did a deathbed confession reveal the location of Nazi gold train? |work=[[The Daily Telegraph]] |publisher=[[Telegraph Media Group]] |date=August 28, 2015 |access-date=2015-08-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="dailymail"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Graun"&gt;{{cite news |title=‘Nazi gold train’ draws treasure hunters to south-west Poland |url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/aug/31/nazi-gold-train-draws-treasure-hunters-to-south-west-poland |access-date=2015-08-31 |publisher=[[The Guardian]] |agency=AFP |date=August 31, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Polish authorities sectioned off woodland in the area of kilometre 65, as well as deploying police and other guards in order to prevent access to the numerous treasure hunters who had arrived armed with detection equipment.&lt;ref name="Graun"/&gt; In late September, the Polish military, acting at the request of the regional governor, began to clear the surface of trees and search for booby traps and mines.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2015/09/30/world/europe/possible-nazi-tunnels-fuel-treasure-seekers-in-poland.html |title=Possible Nazi Tunnels Fuel Treasure Seekers in Poland |publisher=[[The New York Times]] |author-first=Joanna |author-last=Berendt |date=September 29, 2015 |access-date=2015-09-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; The military confirmed on October 4 that no explosives or other dangers existed, down to a metre's depth.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.thenews.pl/1/9/Artykul/223586,Polish-military-says-site-of-alleged-Nazi-gold-train-is-safe- |title=Polish military says site of alleged Nazi gold train is safe |work=Radio Poland |date=October 4, 2015 |access-date=2015-11-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In mid-November, two different teams were cleared by city authorities in [[Wałbrzych]] to make a non-invasive assessment of the site.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.thenews.pl/1/9/Artykul/227716,Two-teams-cleared-to-find-Nazi-gold-train-in-Poland |title=Two teams cleared to find 'Nazi gold train' in Poland |work=Radio Poland |date=November 5, 2015 |access-date=2015-11-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first team was Koper and Richter. The second team were mining specialists from the [[AGH University of Science and Technology|Kraków Mining Academy]] headed by Janusz Madej. On 15 December, the second team announced that a survey had found no evidence of a train, though possible evidence of a collapsed tunnel.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-35104117 |title=Nazi gold train: 'No evidence' of discovery in Poland |work=BBC News |date=December 15, 2015 |access-date=2015-12-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; Koper and Richter stood by their claim of a train to which Madej responded "It's human to make a mistake, but it's foolish to stand by it."&lt;ref name="berendt"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2015/12/16/world/europe/hopes-dashed-again-in-hunt-for-fabled-nazi-gold-train-in-poland.html |title=Hopes Dashed Again in Hunt for Fabled Nazi Gold Train in Poland |publisher=[[The New York Times]] |author-first=Joanna |author-last=Berendt |date=December 15, 2015 |access-date=2015-12-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In May 2016, despite outside expert opinion that no train existed, Koper and Richter secured permission to begin digging at the site from the owners of the property, Polish State Railways.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2016/05/09/nazi-gold-train-hunters-defy-sceptics-and-begin-digging-for-trea/ |title=Nazi gold train hunters defy sceptics and begin digging for treasures  |work=The Daily Telegraph |author-first=Matthew |author-last=Day |date=9 May 2016 |access-date=2016-05-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; The excavation commenced on 15 August 2016 with a team of 64 people, including engineers, geologists, chemists, archaeologists and a specialist in military demolitions.&lt;ref name="berendt2"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2016/08/19/world/europe/poland-nazi-gold-train.html |title=Nazi Gold Train May Not Exist, but That Doesn’t Stop Diggers |publisher=[[The New York Times]] |author-first=Joanna |author-last=Berendt |date=August 18, 2016 |access-date=2016-08-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; The excavation reportedly cost 116,000 euros or $131,000 and was financed by private sponsors, and with the help of volunteers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.dw.com/en/why-it-doesnt-matter-whether-the-long-lost-nazi-gold-train-is-ever-found/a-19493049 |title=Why it doesn't matter whether the long-lost Nazi gold train is ever found |work=Deutsche Welle |author-first=Nadine |author-last=Wojcik |date=August 23, 2016 |access-date=2016-08-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The dig was halted after seven days when no tracks, tunnel or train were found.&lt;ref name="berendt3"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2016/08/25/world/europe/nazi-gold-train-poland.html |title=Hunt for Nazi Gold Train Digs Up Nothing but Dirt |publisher=[[The New York Times]] |author-first=Joanna |author-last=Berendt |date=August 24, 2016 |access-date=2016-08-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; The radar images thought to have been the train were revealed to be natural ice formations. An official from the town admitted tourism was up 44% for the year, and said "the publicity the town has gotten in the global media is worth roughly around $200 million. Our annual budget for promotion is $380,000, so think about that. Whether the explorers find anything or not, that gold train has already arrived." The town mayor was considering naming a roundabout after Koper and Richter.&lt;ref name="berendt3"/&gt; The search would continue, according to Koper and Richter, in other nearby locations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://sputniknews.com/europe/201610201046547688-nazi-underground-factory/ |title=Polish 'Gold Train' Hunters Start Searching for Nazi Underground Factory |work=Sputnik News |author-first=Janek |author-last=Skarzynski |date=October 20, 2016 |access-date=2016-10-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Replica==
In 2016, a group of enthusiasts began construction of a full-size replica of a Nazi armored train in an old paper mill located about 15&amp;nbsp;km from the site of the Koper and Richter embankment dig. It is designed to become a tourist attraction.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.msn.com/en-gb/travel/news/nazi-gold-train-replica-being-built-in-poland/ar-BBwYE7L?li=BBoPU0T |title=Nazi gold train replica being built in Poland |work=AOL Money UK |author-first=Rosie |author-last=Care |date=October 5, 2016 |access-date=2016-10-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.belfasttelegraph.co.uk/video-news/video-legendary-nazi-gold-train-replica-being-built-in-poland-35099894.html |title=Video: Legendary Nazi gold train replica being built in Poland |work=Belfast Telegraph |author=Lydia Batham |date=October 3, 2016 |access-date=2016-10-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Second Ottoman–Venetian War''' was fought between the [[Ottoman Empire]] and the [[Republic of Venice]] for control of the lands that were contested between the two parties in the [[Aegean Sea]], [[Ionian Sea]] and the [[Adriatic Sea]]. The war lasted from 1499 to 1503.

The Turks, under the command of Admiral [[Kemal Reis]], were victorious and forced the Venetians to recognize their gains in 1503.

==The war==

=== 1499===
In January 1499, Kemal Res set sail from [[Constantinople]] with a force of 10 [[galley]]s and 4 other types of ships, and in July 1499 met with the huge Ottoman fleet and took over its command in order to wage a large-scale war against the [[Republic of Venice]]. The Ottoman fleet consisted of 67 galleys, 20 [[galliot]]s and about 200 smaller vessels. In August 1499, Kemal Reis defeated the [[Venetian navy]] under the command of [[Antonio Grimani]] at the [[Battle of Zonchio]] (also known as the Battle of Sapienza or the First Battle of Lepanto). It was the first naval battle in history with cannons used on ships, and took place on four separate days: on August 12, 20, 22 and 25, 1499. After reaching the [[Ionian Sea]] with the large Ottoman fleet, Kemal Reis encountered the Venetian fleet of 47 galleys, 17 galliots and about 100 smaller vessels under the command of [[Antonio Grimani]] near [[Cape Zonchio]] and won an important victory. During the battle, Kemal Reis sank the galley of Andrea Loredan, a member of the influential Loredan family of Venice. Antonio Grimani was arrested on 29 September but was eventually released. Grimani later became the [[Doge of Venice]] in 1521. The Ottoman Sultan [[Bayezid II]] gifted 10 of the captured Venetian galleys to Kemal Reis, who stationed his fleet at the island of [[Cefalonia]] between October and December 1499.

Ottoman incursions into inland Dalmatia also started in 1499,&lt;ref name="Raukar-1990"/&gt; under command of Isa Pasha and [[Feriz Beg]].{{Sfn|Goodwin|2013|p=104}}

===1500===

In December 1499, the Venetians attacked [[Naupactus|Lepanto]] with the hope of regaining their lost territories in the [[Ionian Sea]]. Kemal Reis set sail from Cefalonia and re-took Lepanto from the Venetians. He stayed in Lepanto between April and May 1500, where his ships were repaired by an army of 15,000 Ottoman craftsmen brought from the area. From there, Kemal Reis set sail and bombarded the Venetian ports on the island of [[Corfu]], and in August 1500 he once again defeated the Venetian fleet at the [[Battle of Modon (1500)|Battle of Modon]]. Kemal Reis bombarded the fortress of [[Methoni, Messenia|Modon]] from the sea and captured the town. He later engaged with the Venetian fleet off the coast of [[Koroni|Coron]] and captured the town along with a Venetian brigantine. From there Kemal Reis sailed towards the Island of [[Sapientza]] (Sapienza) and sank the Venetian galley ''Lezza''. In September 1500, Kemal Reis assaulted Voiussa and in October he appeared at Cape Santa Maria on the Island of [[Lefkada]], before ending the campaign and returning to Constantinople in November. With the Battle of Modon, the Turkish fleet and army quickly overwhelmed most of the Venetian possessions in [[Greece]]. Modon and Coron, the "two eyes of the Republic", were lost. [[Doge of Venice|Doge]] [[Agostino Barbarigo]] asked the Pope and the [[Catholic Monarchs]] for help, and on 24 December a [[Spain|Spanish]]–Venetian army commanded by [[Gonzalo de Córdoba]] [[Reconquest of Cephalonia|took Cephalonia]], temporarily stopping the Ottoman offensive on eastern Venetian territories.

The Ottoman incursions in Dalmatia escalated to the point where Venice was forced to sign a treaty with [[Vladislaus II of Hungary]] and [[Pope Alexander VI]] by which they pledged 140,000 ducats a year for the [[Kingdom of Hungary]] to actively defend its southern Croatian territories, which aided the defence of Venetian Dalmatia, signed after long negotiations on 13 May 1501.&lt;ref name="Raukar-1990"&gt;{{cite journal | first = Tomislav | last = Raukar | url = http://hrcak.srce.hr/index.php?show=clanak&amp;id_clanak_jezik=110340&amp;lang=en | title = Hrvatska na razmeđu XV i XVI. stoljeća | language = Croatian | journal = Senjer Jahrbuch | volume = 10 | number = 1 |date=October 1990 | issn = 0582-673X | publisher = City Museum Senj – Senj Museum Society | location = [[Senj]], Croatia | page = 9 | accessdate = 2012-07-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1501 [[Feriz Beg]] captured [[Durrës|Durazzo]] in [[Venetian Albania]].{{Sfn|Press|1948|p=80}}

By the end of 1502, Venice and the Ottoman Empire agreed on an armistice.&lt;ref name="Raukar-1990"/&gt; On 31 January 1503, Venice signed another treaty with Vladislaus II, having already paid 124,000 ducats through the previous treaty, to pay 30,000 ducats a year for the same purpose.&lt;ref name="Raukar-1990"/&gt;

In 1503, Turkish cavalry raids reached Venetian territory in [[Northern Italy]], and Venice was forced to recognize the Ottoman gains, ending the war.

The economy of the Venetian cities in Dalmatia was severely impacted by the Turkish occupation of the hinterland during this war.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | first = Tomislav | last = Raukar | url = http://hrcak.srce.hr/index.php?show=clanak&amp;id_clanak_jezik=86538&amp;lang=en | title = Venecija i ekonomski razvoj Dalmacije u XV i XVI stoljeću | language = Croatian | journal = Journal of the Institute of Croatian History | volume = 10 | number = 1 |date=November 1977 | issn = 0353-295X | publisher = [[Faculty of Philosophy, Zagreb]] | location = Zagreb, Croatia | pages = 218–221 | accessdate = 2012-07-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Aftermath==

By September 1510, Vladislaus had received a total of 116,000 ducats under the terms of the second treaty with Venice.&lt;ref name="Raukar-1990"/&gt; After 1508, he had also been under pressure from the [[League of Cambrai]] to join them against Venice, but skillful Venetian diplomacy prevented that.&lt;ref name="Raukar-1990"/&gt;

The Pacific Northwest tree octopus website is among a number of sites commonly used in [[Information literacy|Internet literacy]] classes in schools, although it was not created for that purpose.
==Internet literacy studies==
Leu et al. (2007) conducted an empirical study on 13-year old US school children’s ability to critically evaluate online information for reliability.&lt;ref&gt;Leu, D. J., Reinking, D., Carter, A., Castek, J., Coiro, J., Henry, L. A., ... &amp; Zawilinski, L. (2007). Defining online reading comprehension: Using think aloud verbal protocols to refine a preliminary model of Internet reading comprehension processes. ''D. Alvermann (Chair) 21st Century Literacy: What is it, How do students get it, and how do we know if they have it''.&lt;/ref&gt; The sample included the top quartile of school children (n=53) in samples from the states of Connecticut and South Carolina. Each school child was exposed to the spoof site ''“Save The Northwest Pacific Tree Octopus''" ([http://zapatopi.net/treeoctopus]/, devoted to this rare species of octopus, complete with pictures of the animal itself and its environment. The school children then received a short, fictitious, message from another class, asking them to locate and evaluate the reliability of the website. They were to provide three reasons for their answer, and summarize the most important information from that website in one or two sentences. Then they were asked to send their information via IM, email, or to post this on a blog site. Following the activity, school chldren were interviewed to ensure that they were familiar with the term "reliable," an important concept in the task.  When asked what this term meant, all responded with answers indicating that they understood the term (e.g., "It means that you can trust it;" "It means it will always be there for you;" or "It's like a friend that you can trust").

In the spring of 2017, Loos, Ivan &amp; Leu (2018)&lt;ref&gt;Loos, E.F., Ivan, L., &amp; Leu, D. (2018). Save The Pacific Northwest Tree Octopus”: a hoax revisited. Or: how vulnerable are school children to Fake News? ''Information and'' ''Learning Science, 119'' (9, 10), 514-528.

&lt;/ref&gt; replicated the study in a Dutch school class of 27 children (13 girls and 14 boys, 11/12 years old) in the following way: The teacher and the school children were told by the first author of the study that the lesson that would follow would be an online reading comprehension exercise; the real purpose of the lesson was not revealed in advance. The children were asked by the scholar to visit the abovementioned website. They were given the following instructions: “Have a look at this website. Look at the pictures, click on the links if you wish. Do not hurry, you have time enough. And this is not a test. It will not be graded.” The website was automatically translated to Dutch, a facility offered by the chrome notebook they all used. Then, they were asked to answer the following questions: (1) This website presents an octopus living in trees. What country does this animal live in?, (2) According to the website, this particular octopus is an endangered species. For what reason?, (3)  If Greenpeace were to ask you to save this octopus, would you support this and sign? YES, because … NO, because … (choose one), (4) Were there parts of the website you didn’t understand? If so, please explain., (5) Are there any other comments about this website you would like to make?" Hence, these school children thought the text was about their willingness to undertake action for an endangered animal. The pupils who answered ‘YES’ to question (3) were judged as perceiving the site as a reliable one. In this way, it was not necessary to explicitly ask about the reliability of the site, which would have risked priming them. The school children were debriefed after the session and they received a new media literacies training.
===Results===
The 2007 US study found that slightly more than half (27) of the 53 schoolchildren taking part in the study reported the website as being very reliable. Only 6 out of the 53 school children (11%) viewed the website as unreliable. Each of these 6 school children had just participated in a lesson that used this website to teach them to be suspicious of information online. In the 2017 Dutch study only 2 out of the in total 27 schoolchildren (7%) recognized that the website was a hoax. The setting of the task (school environment), the trust in their teacher and the scholar, and the emotional involvement (the topic was an animal in danger) might have made it more difficult for them to perceive the information on the website as fake. Several told the scholar they were shocked that they had considered the digital information on the website to be reliable, as they had received several new literacies training at school over the past year.

"'''Partytime'''" is a song by [[45 Grave]], released as the [[A-side and B-side|B-side]] to the "[[School's Out (song)|School's Out]]" single in 1984.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.discogs.com/45-Grave-Schools-Out/release/399224&lt;/ref&gt; The song was taken from their debut album, ''[[Sleep in Safety]]''. However, the single version, dubbed "Partytime (The Story of Sabine)", is shorter in length and notably heavier, with more smoothly flowing lyrics and a shorter introduction. This single version was included on the 1993 reissue of ''Sleep in Safety''. 

"Partytime" is probably 45 Grave's most well-known song, having been used as the theme song to the 1985 film ''[[The Return of the Living Dead]]'' and featured on the [[The Return of the Living Dead#Soundtrack|soundtrack]]. This "Zombie Version" was shorter and heavier than both previous versions of the song, and eschewed the story of the previous versions. Another version, featured on compilations ''[[Autopsy (45 Grave album)|Autopsy]]'', ''Debasement Tapes'' and ''A Devil's Possessions'', has a different vocal melody and is introduced with laughter and different lyrics.

The A-side, "School's Out," a cover of the [[Alice Cooper]] song of the same name, was featured as a bonus track on the re-released version of ''[[Sleep in Safety]]''. This version differs little from Cooper's original, but makes use of [[Synthesizer|keyboards]].

==Lyrics and interpretation==
The song is about a 5-year-old girl who is brutally raped, abused and killed by her mother and friends, and the events that followed. As Dinah Cancer explained: "It's based on a story that I read in a true crime mag. The insanity and cruelty went on. So that 'Partytime' is about child abuse but it is written as a tribute to the little girl, Sabine. The song is about what her family did to her and how she didn't deserve it".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mysteryisland.net/dinahcancer Interview with Dinah Cancer]&lt;/ref&gt;

==In popular culture==
"Partytime" was notably used in the 1985 film ''The Return of the Living Dead'', and was later used during the ''[[Call of Duty: Black Ops]]'' "Call of the Dead" trailer.

A '''polar bear plunge''' is an event held during the winter where participants enter a body of water despite the low temperature.  In the United States, polar bear plunges are usually held to raise money for a [[charitable organization]]. In Canada, polar bear swims are usually held on New Year's Day to celebrate the new year.

==Canada==
In Canada, "Polar Bear Swims", "plunges" or "dips" are a New Year's Day tradition in numerous communities across the country.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.cbc.ca/canada/story/2010/01/01/canada-polar-bear-dip-new-year.html |accessdate=December 31, 2010 |deadurl=yes |title=Polar bear dippers start 2010 with icy plunge|date=January 1, 2010 |publisher=CBC News|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100105033902/http://www.cbc.ca/canada/story/2010/01/01/canada-polar-bear-dip-new-year.html |archivedate=January 5, 2010 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="CBC2013"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/canadian-polar-bear-dippers-brave-freezing-temperatures-1.1413252|title=Canadian polar bear dippers brave freezing temperatures|date=January 1, 2013|publisher=CBC News}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/toronto/polar-bear-dips-deep-freeze-doesn-t-dissuade-swimmers-1.2481075|title=Polar bear dips: deep freeze doesn't dissuade swimmers|date=January 1, 2014|publisher=CBC News}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Ly-TFRiPy4 Watch ''The Rick Mercer Report'' segment on Polar Bear Dipping in Canada]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Vancouver]], BC's annual Polar Bear Swim Club has been active since 1920 and typically has 1,000 to 2,000 registered participants, with a record 2,128 plunging into English Bay in 2000.

[[File:Nieuwjaarsduik.jpg|thumb|right|320px|The Nieuwjaarsduik in Scheveningen (2010)]]
Every New Year's Day around 10,000 people dive collectively into the icy cold sea water at [[Scheveningen]], a Dutch beach resort town, since 1960. In 89 locations on beaches and in lakes all over the country, each year around 30,000 people participate in this "Nieuwjaarsduik" (English: New Year's dive), with a record 36,000 participants on January 1, 2012. Since 1998, [[Unox]], a [[Unilever]] food brand often associated with winter, adopted the Nieuwjaarsduik and ever since it is tradition to wear Unox branded winter caps and gloves.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.unox.nl/nl/event/nieuwjaarsduik/info_url|title=UNOX NIEUWJAARSDUIK 2018|publisher=|accessdate=December 29, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.telegraaf.nl/binnenland/11221271/__Nieuwjaarsduik_bijzonder_populair_dit_jaar__.html|title=Nieuwjaarsduik bijzonder populair dit jaar|work=telegraaf.nl}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==New Zealand==
Polar plunges (the local name) are held at various beaches in New Zealand, usually on the weekend closest to the shortest day in late June. Among other places, polar plunges are led at [[Papamoa Beach]] ([[Tauranga]]),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nzherald.co.nz/bay-news/news/article.cfm?c_id=1503768&amp;objectid=11893471|title=Papamoa Polar Plunge|first=Rebecca|last=Mauger|date=July 20, 2017|publisher=|accessdate=January 12, 2018|via=www.nzherald.co.nz}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Saint Clair Beach]] ([[Dunedin]]),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nzherald.co.nz/|title=Hundreds take Polar Plunge in Dunedin|first=Shawn|last=McAvinue|date=June 16, 2013|publisher=|accessdate=January 12, 2018|via=www.nzherald.co.nz}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Castlecliff]] ([[Wanganui]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nzherald.co.nz/wanganui-chronicle/news/article.cfm?c_id=1503426&amp;objectid=11877592|title=Blimey that's cold!

==United Kingdom==
An annual "Loony Dook" takes place in South Queensferry, Scotland, on New Year's Day. Several thousand attend the event with over one thousand taking the plunge.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.theloonydook.co.uk|title=Default Parallels Plesk Panel Page|publisher=|accessdate=December 26, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Participants regularly dress up for the occasion and will usually parade through the local town acting like "loonies" proceeding the "dook". Aside from the regular enthusiasts, most are still inebriated from New Year's Eve celebrations and have more than likely lost a bet.

Another, smaller plunge occurs on Christmas Day at Blackroot Pool in [[Sutton Park]], Birmingham, England.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.birminghammail.co.uk/news/midlands-news/sutton-park-christmas-day-swim-8345005|title=Sutton Park Christmas Day swim: Watch brave Brummies plunge into Blackroot Pool|publisher=|accessdate=September 15, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Often, participants aim to raise money for charity.

In the British Overseas Territory of [[Gibraltar]], an annual swim is held on Boxing Day.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.visitgibraltar.gi/event/polar-bear-swim-2015/73|title=Visit Gibraltar - Previous Events|website=www.visitgibraltar.gi|accessdate=December 29, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Fouzia Azeem''' ({{lang-ur|{{Nastaliq|فوزیہ عظیم}}}}; 1 March 1990 – 15 July 2016), better known by the name '''Qandeel Baloch''' ({{lang-ur|{{Nastaliq|قندیل بلوچ}}}}), was a [[Pakistanis|Pakistani]] model, actress, and [[social media celebrity]]. Baloch rose to prominence due to her [[Video blog|videos]] on [[social network]]s discussing her daily routine and various controversial issues.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=http://www.samaa.tv/social-buzz/2015/09/self-proclaimed-drama-queen-qandeel-baloch |title=Self proclaimed drama queen: Qandeel Baloch |last=Raza |first=Sarah |date=9 September 2015 |work=Samaa TV |last2=Rehman |first2=Ayesha}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Early life ==
Baloch was born on 1 March 1990 in [[Dera Ghazi Khan]],&lt;ref name="dailypakistan"/&gt; [[Punjab, Pakistan|Punjab]]. She hailed from [[Shah Sadar Din]].&lt;ref name="dailypakistan"&gt;{{Cite news |url=http://en.dailypakistan.com.pk/viral/the-unthinkable-story-qandeel-baloch-who-was-a-bus-hostess-before-becoming-controversy-queen/ |title=Qandeel’s Cinderella story: How a bus hostess from Shadun Lund became controversy queen in Karachi |last=Sindhu |first=Haider Ali |date=23 June 2016 |website=en.dailypakistan.com.pk}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.cnn.com/2016/07/24/world/qandeel-baloch-death-father-azeem/index.html|title=Father of slain social media star: 'It is my desire to take revenge'|last=CNN|first=Chieu Luu, CNN and Shazia Bhatti, for|work=CNN|access-date=2017-11-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; and an underprivileged family and had six brothers and two sisters. Her first job was as a bus hostess.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

==Career==
Baloch's fame was based on her social media posts – pictures, videos and comments. These were considered bold and outrageous by the largely conservative Pakistani community. Her most popular videos were those of her with her catchphrase "How em luking?"(How am I looking?) and those of her saying "Maire sar mai pain ho raha hai" (I'm getting a headache) in a funny and catchy tone. Her catchphrases became viral and were used by the Pakistani youth in enjoyment. They were also featured of dubbing social media site [[dubsmash]] and became widely popular among Indian and Pakistani youth alike.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt; Some international news media compared her to [[Kim Kardashian]];&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=To post or not to post|url=http://www.nationmultimedia.com/life/To-post-or-not-to-post-30280316.html|work=The Nation|date=29 February 2016|accessdate=16 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; however, local commentators stated that she was more significant than Kardashian, as Baloch "went against the norms of society" and lived life on her own terms.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.aljazeera.com/news/2016/07/pakistan-anger-honour-killing-qandeel-baloch-160716140502239.html|title=Pakistan: Anger after honour killing of Qandeel Baloch|website=www.aljazeera.com|access-date=2016-07-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; She started to appear on Pakistani talk shows regularly  by 2014, either to perform songs or to discuss her rising social media popularity. During her life she served as digital manager at Neptuner Web Solutions&lt;ref name="newton"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Web Solutions|first1=Neptuner|title=digital marketing manager|url=http://www.neptuner.org/|website=Neptuner web Solutions}}&lt;/ref&gt; in 2016

In June 2016, Baloch met senior cleric [[Mufti]] [[Mufti Abdul Qawi|Abdul Qawi]] in a hotel room to learn more about her faith; the interaction between them brought about mayhem on social media platforms as their photos went viral online.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=When Qandeel Baloch met Mufti Qavi: A guideline on how NOT to learn Islam|url=http://tribune.com.pk/story/1127984/qandeel-baloch-met-mufti-qavi-guideline-not-learn-islam/|publisher=[[The Express Tribune]]|accessdate=22 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=http://en.dailypakistan.com.pk/lifestyle/real-story-of-mufti-qavis-breaks-fast-with-qandeel-balcoh/ |title=What really happened when Mufti Abdul Qavi broke his fast with Qandeel Baloch in a hotel? |last=Hussain |first=Fayyaz  |access-date=22 June 2016 |agency=[[Daily Pakistan]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Qandeel Baloch claims Mufti Qavi ‘hopelessly in love’ with her!|url=http://www.pakistantoday.com.pk/2016/06/20/news/mufti-qavi-breaks-fast-with-qandeel-baloch/|accessdate=22 June 2016|agency=[[Pakistan Today]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; She also wore a hat with the Mufti's signature.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Qandeel Baloch stirs storm with selfies|url=http://www.thenews.com.pk/latest/129556-Qandeel-Baloch-stirs-storm-with-selfies|accessdate=22 June 2016|agency=[[The News International|THE NEWS INTERNATIONAL]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; The meeting led to the Mufti being suspended from his position on one of Pakistan's religious committees, and to Baloch being a regular on popular Pakistani current affairs and news programmes. She appeared on various popular Pakistani TV shows with senior anchors such as [[Mubashir Lucman]]. She would mostly be on talk shows debating with religious scholars on her western and controversial acts and lifestyle.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.cnn.com/2016/07/16/asia/pakistan-qandeel-baloch-murder/index.html|title=Pakistan social media star killed by brother|publisher=CNN|first=Sophia |last=Saifi|website=CNN|access-date=2016-07-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A previous stunt which went viral on social media was her promise to strip dance for her followers and to dedicate her dance to cricketer [[Shahid Afridi]] if Pakistan won the [[Twenty20]] match against India on 19 March 2016. She released a teaser on social media, which went viral, but Pakistan lost the match.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Qandeel Baloch: Pak model to strip if team win WT20 match against India|url=http://www.hindustantimes.com/world-t20/qandeel-baloch-pak-model-to-strip-if-team-win-wt20-match-against-india/story-n2YzcisDpdu7CMCrvQAuGI.html|work=Hindustan Times|date=18 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some Indian media compared her with [[Poonam Pandey]] at this point due to her controversial personality.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Someone seems to be going the Poonam Pandey way this #WT20 season. Howzat?|url=http://www.ibnlive.com/news/buzz/someone-seems-to-be-going-the-poonam-pandey-way-this-wt20-season-howzat-1216958.html|first= Tanushree |last=Pandey|work=IBN Live|date=16 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Pakistan Got its own Poonam Pandey!

As her media presence grew, Baloch began to use her position to comment on [[Women in Pakistan|women's position in Pakistani society]]. The week before she died, she released a music video entitled ''Ban,'' which mocked the restrictions placed on women in the country.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; In an interview with controversial anchor [[Mubashir Luqman]], Baloch named [[Sunny Leone]], [[Rakhi Sawant]] and [[Poonam Pandey]] as her inspirations.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=APDP – All Pakistani Dramas Page|title=Khara Sach With Mubashir Luqman 25 March 2016 – Qandeel Baloch Exclusive Interview|date=2016-03-25|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=InKBCMLwsQk|accessdate=2016-03-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; She also said that many organizations, people and media groups were calling her to feature in their shows to increase their own [[Target rating point|ratings]].

=== Security concerns ===
Following the June 2016 meeting with Qawi, Baloch kept a press conference and reported that she received death threats both from him and from others, and demanded police protection from the state.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=http://tribune.com.pk/story/1129476/receiving-life-threatening-calls-mufti-qawi-claims-qandeel-baloch/ |title=Receiving life-threatening calls from Mufti Qawi, claims Qandeel Baloch |work=[[The Express Tribune]] |access-date=16 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At around the same time, Baloch's ex-husband described in the media their brief marriage, revealing intimate details of their relationship. Baloch claimed her husband had been abusive, and cried publicly about the pain of the marriage.&lt;ref name=":2"/&gt; Around 14 July 2016, Baloch spoke by phone to a reporter from the ''[[Express Tribune]]'' paper and stated that she feared for her life.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; She told the reporter that she had sought protection from the police but on receiving no response, had decided to move abroad with her parents after the [[Eid al-Fitr]] holiday as she felt unsafe in Pakistan.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite news |url=http://tribune.com.pk/story/1142996/qandeel-baloch-shot-dead-multan/ |title=Qandeel Baloch strangled to death by brother in suspected honour killing |date=2016-07-16 |work=[[The Express Tribune]] |access-date=2016-07-17 |language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Personal life ==
Baloch married Aashiq Hussain in 2008, aged 17, and had one son with him.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=http://tribune.com.pk/story/1141469/plot-thickens-qandeel-baloch-married-son/ |title=Plot thickens: Qandeel Baloch was once married and has a son |work=[[The Express Tribune]] |access-date=16 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Qandeel Baloch's ex-husband comes forward with startling claims|url=http://tribune.com.pk/story/1141118/qandeel-balochs-ex-husband-comes-forward-startling-claims/|accessdate=16 July 2016|agency=[[The Express Tribune]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Baloch left her husband a year later, saying he was abusive.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://channel24.pk/pakistan/2016/07/13/qandeels-baloch-is-mother-of-a-7-yr-old-son/|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160715160037/http://channel24.pk/pakistan/2016/07/13/qandeels-baloch-is-mother-of-a-7-yr-old-son/|dead-url=yes|archive-date=2016-07-15|title=Secret marriage of Qandeel Baloch; Mother of seven years old son|last=Mohsin|first=Mahboob|date=2016-07-13|website=24 News HD|language=en-US|access-date=2016-07-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are reports Baloch was separated from a second marriage.&lt;ref name="firstpost-death"&gt;{{cite news|title=Pakistani model Qandeel Baloch murdered in suspected 'honour killing'|url=http://www.firstpost.com/world/pakistani-model-qandeel-baloch-shot-dead-in-suspected-honour-killing-2896966.html|accessdate=16 July 2016|publisher=FirstPost|date=16 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==In popular culture==
Baloch's death has drawn mixed reactions from different sections of society in Pakistan. Some called her death an honour killing and some think that the motive was money. An episode in the [[A-Plus Entertainment]] series ''Yeh Junoon'' was partially based on her life. The series starred [[Zhalay Sarhadi]] and [[Shamoon Abbasi]] in lead roles. [[Sharmeen Obaid-Chinoy]]'s untitled documentary film on her life is under production, that will be released in 2017.

On July 27. 2017, [[Urdu1]] started to air a 28-episode biopic television drama titled ''[[Baaghi (TV series)|Baaghi]]'' (meaning "Rebel" in Urdu) based on Qandeel's life, where [[Saba Qamar]] plays her character. The first episode amassed more than 1,200,000 views on YouTube. 
&lt;ref&gt;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOiiNhOD17o&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2016, [[Dawn (newspaper)|Dawn]] reported that Baloch biography page on Wikipedia was the fourth most read amongst Pakistani personalities in 2016.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Which Pakistanis dominated Wikipedia searches in 2016?|url=http://www.dawn.com/news/1304978/|accessdate=1 January 2017|publisher=Dawn|date=31 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In March 2017, The British-Pakistani/Indian-American hip hop group [[Swet Shop Boys]] dedicated the track ''Aaja'' from their latest album in the memory of Qandeel Baloch. Recorded samples of her voice from her social media content is also used towards the end of the track.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite video|title=Swet Shop Boys - Aaja ft.

The musical band Bumbu Sauce also released a song on Qandeel Baloch entitled "Vuzzeerrayazam", which gives Qandeel the titles of ‘Prime Minister’ and ‘Qoum ki beti'.

On June 2017, a documentary film ''Undercover Asia S4: In The Name Of Honour'' premiered on [[Channel NewsAsia]]. Produced by MAKE Productions, it tells how Baloch's bold and sexy videos challenged convention and shocked a nation which later led to fatal consequences.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Undercover Asia S4: In The Name Of Honour|url=http://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/catch-up-tv/undercover-asia-s4/in-the-name-of-honour-8957890|website=[[Channel NewsAsia]]|accessdate=15 November 2017|date=15 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Rendez-vous Houston: A City in Concert''''' was a live performance by musician [[Jean Michel Jarre]] amidst the skyscrapers of [[Downtown Houston|downtown]] [[Houston, Texas|Houston]] on the evening of April 5, 1986, coinciding with the release of the ''[[Rendez-Vous (Jean Michel Jarre album)|Rendez-Vous]]'' album.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine

}}&lt;/ref&gt; For a period of time, it held a place in the ''[[Guinness Book of Records]]'' as the largest outdoor "rock concert" in history, with figures varying from 1 to 1.5 million in attendance. Rendez-vous Houston is remembered for being the concert which celebrated the astronauts of the [[Space Shuttle Challenger disaster|Space Shuttle ''Challenger'' disaster]], which had happened only two and a half months earlier. One of Jarre's friends, astronaut [[Ronald McNair|Ron McNair]], had been killed in the disaster.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite AV media notes

}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was supposed to play the [[saxophone]] from space during the track "Last Rendez-Vous"; his substitute for the concert was Houston native [[Kirk Whalum]].

==Planning and problems of the concert==
In 1985, Jarre was contacted by the musical director of the [[Houston Grand Opera]] with the proposal for him related to the celebrations of Texas' 150th birthday in 1986, 150th birthday of the city of Houston and [[NASA]]'s 25th birthday. Because of NASA's involvement, Jarre got the chance to keep in contact with a friend of his, astronaut captain [[Bruce McCandless II]] who later introduced Jarre to a flight companion of his, astronaut and jazz musician [[Ronald McNair|Ron McNair]]. Together they had the idea that for the celebrations, Jarre would create a piece of music that could be performed by McNair on his saxophone. The idea was that McNair, on his next trip into space in the ''Challenger'' Space Shuttle, would perform (and record onto video) the new piece of music, which would then be projected (through video playback) onto a giant screen that was to be constructed on the front of one of the buildings.

&lt;!--  Commented out because image was deleted: [[Image:Houston28.jpg|150ppx|left|thumb|Jean-Michel Jarre preparing the concert]] --&gt;
On January 28, 1986, McNair telephoned Jarre for the last time. "...Everything's ready. See you in a week's time. Watch me on TV for the takeoff!" On that same day, an appalled world witnessed a historic tragedy - the ''Challenger'' Space Shuttle disintegrated in mid-air while on its ascent into space. Distraught by what happened, Jarre almost decided to cancel the concert. However, astronauts from NASA (including Bruce McCandless) telephoned Jarre. They asked Jarre not to cancel, as now the concert ''must'' go ahead, and be held in tribute to pay respect to the astronauts who had lost their lives in the disaster.

The run-up to the concert itself still did not go smoothly. Rain poured down on Houston a couple of days before the concert, destroying much of the equipment on stage (which was repaired by the day of the concert), breaking wires and ruining instruments. Furthermore, there had been a very strong wind blowing all week, which ended up splitting open the giant projection screen (which was made from several small canvas panels) and causing it to come crashing down.

The local police turned up during the middle of a rehearsal demanding immediate payment of a fine; the residents who lived nearby were complaining of excessive noise and were exhausted from their sleepless nights. Also, [[FBI]] officers threatened to put a stop to the whole proceedings because they were being deprived of electricity. 30 large lamps had been installed on top of FBI headquarters, and they were causing problems with their surveillance of [[Muammar al-Gaddafi|Colonel Gaddafi]], who was visiting the city at that time.

There was still one more slight problem before the concert started. The chief of the [[Houston Fire Department]], Robert Clayton, had told Francis Dreyfus, Jarre's manager, that the show must be cancelled. This was due to a change of the wind direction; the Chief was concerned that the crowd would be showered with firework debris. After some back-and-forth argument with Dreyfus, Clayton agreed that the concert could proceed on a 'see how it goes' term.

During the concert (specifically, during the performance of [[Equinoxe]] Part 5), the amount of fireworks being used and the direction of the wind did indeed cause debris to rain down on the audience, covering them in ash. Clayton frantically began to try to stop the proceedings, fearing that people would be injured. Although his fears were duly noted, the crowd took no notice of the ash falling onto them and carried on enjoying the concert proceedings.

'''SDEWES Centre''' ('''The International Centre for Sustainable Development of Energy, Water and Environment Systems)''', is a non-governmental scientific organization based at the [[University of Zagreb]], [[Croatia]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://eai.eu/organization/sdewes-centre European Alliance for Innovation], (retrieved 2015-06-18)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wisions.net/posts/wisions-at-the-sdewes-conference-in-dubrovnik-croatia/page:26#post53 Wisions of sustainability], (retrieved 2015-06-18)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Mission==
SDEWES Centre is dedicated to the improvement and dissemination of knowledge on methods, policies and technologies for increasing the [[Our Common Future|sustainability of development]] by [[Decoupling Natural Resource Use and Environmental Impacts from Economic Growth report|de-coupling growth from natural resources]] and replacing them with [[knowledge-based economy]], taking into account its economic, environmental and social pillars. One of the main issues of the coming decades is to improve efficiencies by integrating various life supporting systems, using [[waste]] from one, as resource in other, and in exact moment when it is beneficial to all, integrating [[power engineering|electricity]], [[HVAC#Heating|heating]], [[cooling]], [[transport]], [[Water supply network|water]], [[Green building|buildings]], [[Industrial ecology|industry]], [[forestry]] and [[agriculture]] systems.

The Centre organizes courses, summer schools, public lectures, seminars and workshops in order to promote [[sustainable development]] of [[Energy development|energy]], [[Water supply network|water]] and [[Human impact on the environment|environment]] systems and provides professional opinion on issues of [[sustainability]] and sustainability metrics. The Centre also organizes a series of international SDEWES conferences for scientists to discuss issues of sustainability of [[Energy development|energy]], [[Water supply network|water]] and [[Human impact on the environment|environment]] system. Through these actions, SDEWES Centre aims to provide a research platform that will provide comprehensive R&amp;D activities, assessment and consultation on the research subjects of sustainable development.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.worldacademy.org/print/6124 World academy of art and science] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150618115743/http://www.worldacademy.org/print/6124 |date=2015-06-18 }}, (retrieved  2015-05-05)&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
SDEWES started as a project co-funded by [[Community Research &amp; Development Information Service|CORDIS]] under the FP5 – INCO 2 programme&lt;ref&gt;[http://cordis.europa.eu/project/rcn/63666_en.html SDEWES project funded by CORDIS] (retrieved  2015-06-17)&lt;/ref&gt; in 2002, when first Dubrovnik Conference on [[Sustainable Development]] of [[Energy]], [[Water]] and [[Environment (systems)|Environment]] Systems was organized. Partners in this project were [[University of Zagreb]] and [[Instituto Superior Técnico]] (Lisbon). After the organisation of three more conferences in 2003, 2005 and 2007, SDEWES Centre was established in 2009. Since then, eight more conferences were organized in 2009, 2011, 2012, 2013, 2014, 2015 and 2016. As a separate regional event, the SEE SDEWES Conferences are held every two years, starting with 2014 in Ohrid. The 2nd SEE SDEWES Conference was held in Piran.

== SDEWES-Skopje ==
New section of SDEWES Centre is established in [[Skopje]], [[Republic of Macedonia|Macedonia]], with the goal to gather professionals and scientists from broad range of disciplines, particularly located in the [[Southeast Europe]], in order to provide scientific support for wise policy-making. SDEWES-Skopje aims to extend the activities at regional level including the other [[EU]] candidate and potential candidate countries, as well as [[EU]] neighbourhood countries to foster regional coordination in providing feasible solutions for the common challenges and gaining synergy effects.

'''LovEvolution''' (formerly '''San Francisco LovEvolution''' and '''San Francisco LoveFest''') was a [[technoparade]] and festival that occurred annually in the [[San Francisco Bay Area|Bay Area]] in late September  and early October.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Lovefest San Francisco|url=http://www.festivalpig.com/Lovefest-San-Francisco.html|website=Festival Pig|accessdate=28 June 2014|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140804131518/http://www.festivalpig.com/Lovefest-San-Francisco.html|archivedate=4 August 2014|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; From its inception in 2004 to 2009, the parade included 25 floats and started at San Francisco's 2nd and Market Streets. The parade continued all the way to [[San Francisco Civic Center]] Plaza. The 2009 parade drew over 100,000 people.&lt;ref name="LovEvolution hits Snag in SF"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Matier|first1=Phillip|last2=Ross|first2=Andrew|title=LovEvolution party plans hit snag in S.F.|url=http://www.sfgate.com/bayarea/matier-ross/article/LovEvolution-party-plans-hit-snag-in-S-F-3253762.php|website=SFGate|publisher=San Francisco Chronicle|accessdate=28 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The parade has its origins in [[Berlin|Berlin's]] [[Loveparade]] which began in 1989. In 2003, the city denied the parade a permit and the event moved to [[San Francisco]]. In 2004, when German organizers were able to secure permits back in Berlin, North American organizers decided to continue their own event and dubbed it the LoveFest. In 2009 the name was changed to LovEvolution to avoid confusion with a similarly named electronic music event in LA.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=LovEvolution - San Francisco, CA - on Sat Oct 3, 2009 at Civic Center Plaza|url=http://www.sfstation.com/lovevolution-e674191|website=SF Station|publisher=SF Station|accessdate=28 June 2014|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://archive.is/20140628021420/http://www.sfstation.com/lovevolution-e674191|archivedate=28 June 2014|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2009 the permit for LovEvolution was revoked by officials in San Francisco citing safety concerns.&lt;ref name="LovEvolution hits Snag in SF" /&gt; Unable to find a suitable venue after the permits were revoked the event was cancelled in 2010 and moved to Oakland the following year&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Sankin|first1=Aaron|title=LovEvolution Parade Ditches San Francisco For Oakland|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2011/07/21/lovevolution-parade-moves-to-oakland_n_906246.html|website=Huffington Post|publisher=Huffington Post|accessdate=28 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; and became a paid event.&lt;ref name=oaklandmofo&gt;{{cite web|title=San Francisco Love Evolution 2014|url=http://www.oaklandmofo.com/blog/san-francisco-lovefest-loveparade-love-evolution|website=OaklandMofo|accessdate=28 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since 2011 the parade has not been held and its website states it is looking for a venue.&lt;ref name="oaklandmofo" /&gt;

Artists who have performed at LovEvolution Afterparty in previous years include [[Deadmau5]], [[Above &amp; Beyond (band)|Above &amp; Beyond]], [[DJ Rap]], [[Kaskade]], [[ATB]], [[Armin Van Buuren]], [[Ferry Corsten]], [[Gabriel &amp; Dresden]], [[Kyau &amp; Albert]], [[Deep Voices]], [[Dave Dresden]], [[Green Velvet]], [[Paul Oakenfold]], [[Christopher Lawrence (DJ)|Christopher Lawrence]], [[Junkie XL]], [[Andy Moor (DJ)|Andy Moor]], [[Bad Boy Bill]], [[DJ Dan]], [[Donald Glaude]], [[Dieselboy]], [[Aphrodite]], [[DJ Sasha]], [[John 00 Fleming]], Eddie Halliwell, [[DJ Icey]], [[Mr. Becker]], [[Sector -7G]] and Robert Nickson.

A '''staging area''' (otherwise '''staging point''', '''staging base''' or '''staging post''') is a location where organisms, people, vehicles, equipment or material are assembled before use.  It may refer to:

;Construction
:Designated area where vehicles, supplies, and construction equipment are positioned for access and use to a construction site.

;Ecology
:Resting and feeding places of [[Bird migration|migratory birds]] are referred to as staging areas.

;Entertainment
:Places designated for setting up parades and other elaborate presentations.

;Media
:Designated places for [[news conference]]s placed near locations of high media interest

;Military
:In military usage, a staging area is a place where troops or equipment in transit are assembled or processed.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bartleby.com/61/59/S0695900.html Staging area] (from the [[American Heritage Dictionary]]. Accessed 2008-09-14.)  {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050909100532/http://www.bartleby.com/61/59/S0695900.html |date=9 September 2005 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
:The US Department of Defense uses these definitions:
{{quote|
:(DOD) 1. Amphibious or airborne-A general locality between the mounting area and the objective of an amphibious or airborne expedition, through which the expedition or parts thereof pass after mounting, for refueling, regrouping of ships, and/or exercise, inspection, and redistribution of troops.

:(DOD) 2. Other movements-A general locality established for the concentration of troop units and transient personnel between movements over the lines of communications. Also called SA. See also airborne; marshalling; stage; staging.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dtic.mil/doctrine/jel/doddict/data/s/10684.html DOD Dictionary of Military and Associated Terms - Accessed 13 November 2009]  {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110604224238/http://www.dtic.mil/doctrine/jel/doddict/data/s/10684.html |date=4 June 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;}}
:Often and historically this military staging area has been termed a ''[[point d'appui]]'', which is often on high ground and sometimes coincident with a significant prehistoric monument, as in the case of [[Catto Long Barrow]] in [[Aberdeenshire]], [[Scotland]]. Unlike normal bases, the facilities of a staging area are temporary, mainly because for a certain time it will hold much more troops and materiel than would be reasonable in peacetime.

:Militaries use staging areas to deploy [[military unit]]s, aircraft and [[warship]]s and [[materiel]] ahead of an attack or [[invasion]]. In former times, this used to be generally the border area of one's own country, but in recent wars ([[Gulf War]], [[Kosovo War]], [[Iraq War]]) it may also be the border area of another unrelated country granting access.

;Space exploration
:Area where final assembly is done on [[space vehicle]]s before they are moved out to their [[launch pad]].

;Data management
{{main|Staging (data)}}
:Intermediate storage area between the sources of information and the data warehouse (DW) or Data mart (DM). It is usually of temporary nature, and its contents can be erased after the DW/DM has been loaded successfully.

On April 30, 1970, President Nixon announced [[Cambodian Campaign|the expansion of the Vietnam War into Cambodia]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Military history of Cambodia]]&lt;/ref&gt;{{Better source|reason=per WP:CIRCULAR|date=May 2017}} On May 1, protests on college campuses and in cities throughout the U.S. began. In Seattle, over a thousand protestors gathered at the Federal Courthouse and cheered speakers. "At the University of Maryland, an estimated 1,500 students vandalized an armory building where Air Force ROTC classes were held. And at the University of Cincinnati, a number of demonstrators were arrested after they conducted a sit-in and blocked a busy intersection in the middle of the city. Other students such as at Princeton University protested by cutting classes and sought to organize a nationwide student strike."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://depts.washington.edu/antiwar/may1970strike.shtml | title=The May 1970 Student Strike at UW | author=Zoe Altaras | accessdate=April 30, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At Kent State University, a demonstration with about 500 students&lt;ref name="task force chronology"&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.m4tf.org/chronology.html | title=Chronology of events | work=May 4 Task Force | publisher=May 4 Task Force | accessdate=April 20, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; was held on the Commons. On May 2, students burned down the [[ROTC]] building at [[Kent State shootings|Kent State]]. On May 4, poorly trained National Guardsmen confronted and killed four students during a large protest demonstration at the college. Soon, more than 450 university, college and high school campuses across the country were shut down by student strikes and both violent and non-violent protests that involved more than 4 million students.&lt;ref name="Nix Prez Rev"&gt;{{cite video| people=Director: Joe Angio|title=Nixon a Presidency Revealed|medium=television|publisher=History Channel|date=2007-02-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Reed, NYT, 5/16/1970"&gt;Roy Reed, Special to ''The New York Times'', "F.B.I. Investigating Killing Of 2 Negroes in Jackson :Two Negro Students Are Killed In Clash With Police in Jackson", ''New York Times'' (1857-Current file)  [serial online]. May 16, 1970:1.  Available from: ProQuest Historical Newspapers The New York Times (1851 - 2006). Accessed July 28, 2012, Document ID: 80023683.&lt;/ref&gt;

While opposition to the [[Vietnam War]] had been simmering on American campuses for several years, and the idea of a strike had been introduced by the [[Moratorium to End the War in Vietnam]], which advocated a general strike on the 15th of every month until the war ended, the Kent State shootings seemed to provide the spark for students across the US to adopt the strike tactic.

On May 8, ten days after Nixon announced the Cambodian invasion (and 4 days after the Kent State shootings), 100,000 protesters gathered in Washington and another 150,000 in San Francisco.&lt;ref&gt;Todd Gitlin, ''The Sixties'', New York: Bantam Books, 1987, p. 410.&lt;/ref&gt; Nationwide, students turned their anger on what was often the nearest military facility—college and university [[Reserve Officers' Training Corps]] (ROTC) offices.  All told, 30 ROTC buildings went up in flames or were bombed.  There were violent clashes between students and police at 26 schools and National Guard units were mobilized on 21 campuses in 16 states.&lt;ref&gt;Gitlin, p. 410.&lt;/ref&gt;

For the most part, however, the protests were peaceful — if often tense. Students at [[New York University]], for example, hung a banner out of a window which read "They Can't Kill Us All."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.nyu.edu/library/bobst/collections/exhibits/arch/1970/1970-2.html|title=1970 Timeline|publisher=[[New York University]]|accessdate=2007-05-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Nixon Administration reaction==
The protests and strikes had a dramatic impact, and convinced many Americans, particularly within the administration of President [[Richard Nixon]], that the nation was on the verge of insurrection. [[Ray Price (speechwriter)|Ray Price]], Nixon's chief speechwriter from 1969–74, recalled the Washington demonstrations saying, "The city was an armed camp. The mobs were smashing windows, slashing tires, dragging parked cars into intersections, even throwing bedsprings off overpasses into the traffic down below. This was the quote, student protest. That's not student protest, that’s civil war."&lt;ref name="Nix Prez Rev"/&gt;

Not only was Nixon taken to [[Camp David]] for two days for his own protection, but [[Charles Colson]] (Counsel to President Nixon from 1969 to 1973) stated that the military was called up to protect the administration from the angry students, he recalled that "The [[82nd Airborne]] was in the basement of the executive office building, so I went down just to talk to some of the guys and walk among them, and they're lying on the floor leaning on their packs and their helmets and their cartridge belts and their rifles cocked and you’re thinking, 'This can't be the United States of America. This is not the greatest free democracy in the world. This is a nation at war with itself.'"&lt;ref name="Nix Prez Rev"/&gt;

The student protests in Washington also prompted a peculiar and memorable attempt by President Nixon to reach out to the disaffected students.  As historian [[Stanley Karnow]] reported in his ''Vietnam: A History,'' on May 9, 1970 the President appeared at 4:15&amp;nbsp;a.m. on the steps of the [[Lincoln Memorial]] to discuss the war with 30 student [[dissident]]s who were conducting a vigil there. Nixon "treated them to a clumsy and condescending monologue, which he made public in an awkward attempt to display his benevolence." Nixon had been trailed by White House Deputy for Domestic Affairs [[Egil Krogh]], who saw it differently than Karnow, saying, "I thought it was a very significant and major effort to reach out."&lt;ref name="Nix Prez Rev"/&gt;

In any regard, neither side could convince the other and after meeting with the students Nixon expressed that those in the [[peace movement|anti-war movement]] were the pawns of foreign communists.&lt;ref name="Nix Prez Rev"/&gt; After the student protests, Nixon asked [[H. R. Haldeman]] to consider the [[Huston Plan]], which would have used illegal procedures to gather information on the leaders of the anti-war movement. Only the resistance of [[Federal Bureau of Investigation|FBI]] head [[J. Edgar Hoover]] stopped the plan.&lt;ref name="Nix Prez Rev"/&gt;

As a direct result of the student strike, on June 13, 1970, President Nixon established the [[President's Commission on Campus Unrest]], which became known as the Scranton Commission after its chairman, former Pennsylvania governor [[William Scranton]].  Scranton was asked to study the dissent, disorder, and violence breaking out on college and university campuses.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=http://www.lexisnexis.com/academic/2upa/Aph/pcmCampusUnrest.asp|subscription=yes | title=The Report of the President's Commission on Campus Unrest|location=Washington, DC|publisher=U.S. Government Printing Office|year=1970|accessdate=2007-04-16}} This book is also known as ''The Scranton Commission Report.''&lt;/ref&gt;

==Backlash==
The student protests provoked supporters of the Vietnam War and the Nixon Administration to demonstrate in their own right.  In contrast to the noisy student protests, Administration supporters viewed themselves as "the [[Silent Majority (Politics)|Silent Majority]]" (a phrase coined by Nixon speechwriter [[Patrick Buchanan]]).

In one instance, in New York City on May 8, construction workers attacked student protesters in what came to be called the [[Hard Hat Riot]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5416">The '''Super One National Kart Championships''', also known as '''S1''' or '''Super One''', is a [[karting]] championship based in the United Kingdom. It has been in operation since 1983 and is regarded as the premier karting championship in the UK, producing many famous drivers including [[Lewis Hamilton]], [[Jenson Button]], [[David Coulthard]], [[Dan Wheldon]], [[Anthony Davidson]] and [[Jason Plato]] among others. Profoundly Deaf driver [[Caleb McDuff]] currently competes in the series.

==History==
The first Super 1 meeting was held in 1983 at [[Snetterton Motor Racing Circuit|Snetterton]] where only 4 classes were run as part of the championship. At the time, the championship was not officially recognised as being the "British Championship" as the [[Royal Automobile Club|RAC]] national titles were decided over a one-weekend event. This continued up till 1990 when Super 1 secured the rights to decide the British champion over the course of the series.

Over the years, the Super 1 series has produced champions that have gone on to race in [[Formula 1]] such as [[David Coulthard]], [[Will Stevens]], [[Allan McNish]], [[Jenson Button]], [[Anthony Davidson]], [[Paul di Resta]], [[Ralph Firman]] and [[Lewis Hamilton]]. Other drivers who have won a Super 1 championship and who have gone on to professional motor racing include [[Gary Paffett]], [[Mike Conway]], [[Dan Wheldon]], [[Ben Hanley]] and [[Oliver Jarvis]]

==Classes==
Originally, there were only 4 classes in the Super 1 series. In 2017, 11 different classes ran within the series over 11 different race weekends. 

=== Bambino Classes ===

For drivers from 6 years of age up to the year of their 8th birthday.

*Bambino (1 Round) 

=== Cadet Classes ===

For drivers from 8 years of age up to and including the year of their 13th birthday.

*IAME Cadet (7 Rounds)
*Honda Cadet (7 Rounds)

=== Junior Classes ===

For drivers from 12 years of age up to and including the year of their 17th birthday.

*Minimax (7 Rounds)
*Junior [[Rotax]] (7 Rounds)
*Junior [[TKM (Karting)|TKM]] (7 Rounds)
*Junior X30 (6 Rounds)
*Junior OK (6 Rounds)

=== Senior Classes ===

For drivers over 16 years of age.

*[[Rotax]] 177 (3 Rounds)
*[[TKM (Karting)|TKM]] Extreme (7 Rounds)
*Senior X30 (6 Rounds)
*Senior OK (6 Rounds)
*KZ (2 Rounds)

The OK classes, as well as the TKM classes, are recognised by the Motorsports Association as being British Championships. The remaining are recognised by the Association of British Kart Clubs (ABkC) as National Championships. Each class, apart from the shorter KZ and Bambino championships, also rewards drivers with seeded rankings for the top 10 finishers in the championship standings, these finishing positions may be exclusively used by that driver in that class for the following year at any ABkC recognised event.

==Races==

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5806">'''Susie's Law''' ([[North Carolina House of Representatives|House]] Bill 1609) is a 2010 [[North Carolina]] state law which authorizes up to two years in jail for convicted perpetrators of [[cruelty to animals]].

==Passage of legislation==

The law is named for "Susie", a part [[pit bull]], part [[German Shepherd]], which as a puppy was rescued by a man who found her on August 20, 2009 in Greenfield Park in [[Greensboro, North Carolina]], having been set on fire, in torment and left to die.&lt;ref name=burnedpuppy&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.greensboro.com/news/public_safety/severely-burned-dog-found-in-park/article_c1be96d2-9d3d-5818-a55a-d08ced9e6bde.html/|title=Severely burned dog found in park|date=August 21, 2009|publisher=Greensboro News &amp; Record|accessdate=July 9, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The man took Susie to his nearby home where he then contacted Guilford County Animal Control to take her to a veterinarian. Susie was found to be suffering from severe second and third-degree burns over most of her body; her ears were burned off, and she had a broken jaw and teeth.&lt;ref name=susiethedog&gt;{{cite web|url=http://myfox8.com/2014/06/24/susie-abused-dog-that-inspired-nc-law-nominated-for-award/|title=Susie, abused dog that inspired NC law, nominated for award|date=June 24, 2014|publisher=myfox8.com|accessdate=August 10, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An animal cruelty investigation was launched by Guilford County Animal Control,&lt;ref name=investigation&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.greensboro.com/news/you-can-now-follow-susie-s-recovery-on-her-twitter/article_8ad9dfdb-b9e1-5fcc-a44d-020764b8d4d4.html/|title=You can now follow Susie's recovery on her Twitter page|date=September 8, 2009|publisher=Greensboro News &amp; Record|accessdate=July 9, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; but due to limited resources the investigation was taken over by a detective with Greensboro Police Department who set up a crimestoppers tip line. After a few months a tip was received and Lashawn Demaro Whitehead was arrested and charged with animal cruelty.&lt;ref name=Chargeslaid&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.greensboro.com/news/public_safety/man-charged-in-burning-of-puppy-found-in-park/article_59ebdfe2-d71f-51b6-9ab5-b256fa0f2cde.html/|title=Man charged with burning of puppy found in park|date=November 16, 2009|publisher=Greensboro News &amp; Record|accessdate=July 9, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Susie was adopted by Donna Smith Lawrence, who had been seriously injured in an attack by a pit bull, which she had befriended, several months prior. Donna and her husband, Roy, reside in [[High Point, North Carolina]].&lt;ref name=susiethedog/&gt;

The law reclassifies the "malicious abuse, torture, or killing" of an animal from a Class I to a Class H [[felony]], with the ten-month potential period of confinement.&lt;ref name=wralcom&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wral.com/news/local/story/7835724/#JRhjw7jeHvri53r6.99|title=
Susie's Law toughens penalties for animal cruelty|publisher=[[WRAL-TV]]|date=June 23, 2010|accessdate=August 10, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; LaShawn Whitehead received a two-year prison sentence on conviction of indecent liberties with a minor and burning his girlfriend's personal property, according to records of the [[North Carolina Department of Correction]]. At the time abuse of Whitehead's own dog would have netted no jail time, but Whitehead was found guilty of abusing an animal owned by another person, which brought jail time.&lt;ref name=wralcom/&gt;
 
Susie's Law was passed unanimously in both the [[North Carolina State Senate]] and [[North Carolina House of Representatives]] and was signed into law by North Carolina Governor Beverly Perdue, and took effect on December 1, 2010. Passage was possible through intense citizen involvement when Susie's abuse became public, and fund-raising appeals met with great success.

==Susie in the limelight==

The '''World tango dance tournament''' (in Spanish: ''Campeonato Mundial de Baile de Tango'', also known as ''Mundial de Tango'') is an annual competition of [[Argentine tango|Argentine Tango]], held in [[Buenos Aires]], [[Argentina]], usually in August, as part of the [[Buenos Aires Tango Festival]] organized by the city's government. In 2014 the events were between 13-26/August.

The competition consists of two categories: "Tango de Pista" (Salon Tango), which has strict rules&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Buenos Aires Ciudad.

The World Cup competition is the final leg of a series of pre-competitions held around the world starting from March. Traditionally the city of Buenos Aires and various municipalities choose their own "Municipal" champions who get wildcards into the final rounds. The same wildcard advantage is also given to national or regional champions of recognized competitions; These include Uruguay (UY), Chile (Cali, CL), Colombia (Bogota, CO), Brazil (Rio de Janeiro, BR),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Preliminar oficial Rio de Janeiro 23-26 julio|url=http://www.2xtango.com/preliminar-de-rio-mundial-de-tango-buenos-aires-2015/|accessdate=21 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; USA (San Francisco, US), Russia (Moscow, RU), China (Nanjing, CN), Japan (Tokyo, JP), Korea (Seoul, KR), France&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Paris Concours Tango Argentin 2015.

New municipalities in 2016: Turkey and the region (Istanbul, TR).

The first edition of the ''Mundial de Tango'' competition was held in 2003.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Se viene el Mundial de Baile|url=http://edant.clarin.com/diario/2003/01/04/c-00601.htm|newspaper=[[Clarín (Argentine newspaper)|Clarín]]|date=4 January 2003|accessdate=19 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A closely related and highly influential event is the Buenos Aires City competition. The competition rules&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Reglamento campeonato de baile de la ciudad 2013|url=http://www.puntotango.com.ar/reglamento-campeonato-de-baile-de-la-ciudad-2013/|accessdate=30 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; state that members of the couple must both have "DNI" (i.e. have a resident status of 2 years or more) in Argentina. The competition may be considered somewhat even more demanding because the participants can compete in several dance categories: either Tango Senior (age 40 or older) or Tango Adulto (age 18-39) plus Vals or Milonga. Only couples ''Carlos Estigarribia'' &amp; ''María Laura Sastría'' (2015) and ''Jimena Hoffner'' &amp; ''Fernando Carrasco'' (2008), have won the triple championship. The winners of the tango categories are granted direct access to the final qualifying round in ''Mundial de Tango''. Couples in positions 2 through 5 are granted direct access to the semifinals in ''Mundial de Tango''. These couples represent the city of Buenos Aires in the world cup. The City competition's winners and runners-up are likely to become highly regarded and sought out teachers worldwide.

Worth mentioning is the ''Campeonato inter milongas'' (CIM).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=CIM CAMPEONATO INTER MILONGAS 2015.

There are no restrictions in nationality or residence status of Argentina for the participants. The two monthly winning couples are voted for qualifying rounds and final by the audience and not selected judges.
