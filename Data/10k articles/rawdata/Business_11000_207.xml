'''731 Lexington Avenue''' is a {{convert|1,345,489|sqft|abbr=on}} glass [[skyscraper]] on [[Lexington Avenue]], on the East Side of [[Midtown Manhattan]], [[New York City]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | 
 url=https://www.nytimes.com/2006/07/09/nyregion/09tower.html | title=To Find 1 Beacon Court, Better Ask for Bloomberg | work=[[The New York Times]] | date=July 9, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Opened in 2004, it houses the headquarters of [[Bloomberg L.P.]] and as a result, is sometimes referred to informally as '''Bloomberg Tower'''. The building also houses retail outlets, restaurants and 105 luxury [[condominium]]s. The residence section of the building is known as One Beacon Court and is served by a separate entrance.&lt;ref name="NYT Background" /&gt;

731 Lexington Avenue is a 55-story building with a roof height of {{convert|806|ft|abbr=on}}. It is the [[list of tallest buildings in New York City|24th-tallest building in New York City]] and the [[list of tallest buildings in the United States|46th-tallest building in the United States]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last=Barbanel | first=Josh | title=Luxe but Logy | url=https://www.nytimes.com/2009/04/05/realestate/05deal1.html | work=[[The New York Times]] | date=April 3, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The building occupies the former site of an [[Alexander's]] [[department store]] and is owned by the Alexander's real estate investment trust, the successor to the defunct retail chain.&lt;ref name="NYT Background"/&gt;

==Construction and design==
Construction on the building began in 2001, three years after the vacant [[Alexander's]] department store was demolished.&lt;ref name="NYT Background"/&gt; The building was developed by [[Vornado Realty Trust]], as a fee developer, with [[César Pelli]] &amp; Associates as architect.&lt;ref name=construction/&gt; The building comprises a full city block between Lexington and Third Avenues and 58th and 59th Streets. The complex features two towers constructed above a steel office and retail section, separated by a seven-story atrium.&lt;ref name=construction/&gt; The design of the courtyard at One Beacon Court, which connects 58th and 59th Streets, was inspired by other historic New York enclosures such as [[Grand Central Terminal]], the reading room of the [[New York Public Library Main Branch]], and the skating rink at [[Rockefeller Center]]; glass walls curve around the perimeter of the courtyard, tilting slightly inward as they rise.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last=Davidson | first=Justin | title=Where the sky is no limit | url=http://www.newsday.com/lifestyle/where-the-sky-is-no-limit-1.654872 | work=[[Newsday]] |date=March 22, 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Tenants==
Although the building was originally planned to be entirely residential, [[Bloomberg L.P.]] negotiated a deal with Vornado Realty Trust to lease {{convert|700000|sqft|abbr=on}} of office space at the base of the tower. STUDIOS Architecture did the design, which includes rows of uniform desks for approximately 4,000 employees and a large central atrium known as "the Link" that overlooks the courtyard.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last=Gregor | first=Alison | title=SQUARE FEET: INTERVIEW -- WITH BARRY M.

Retail tenants include [[The Home Depot]], [[H&amp;M]], and [[The Container Store]].&lt;ref name="NYT Background"/&gt; [[Sirio Maccioni]]'s [[Le Cirque]] restaurant moved to the building from [[The New York Palace Hotel]] in 2006, but vacated in 2018.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last=Bruni | first=Frank | title=In Defense of Decadence | url=https://www.nytimes.com/2008/02/06/dining/reviews/06rest.html | work=[[The New York Times]] | date=February 6, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last=Cuozzo | first=Steve | title=A final goodbye to the legendary celeb haven Le Cirque | url=https://nypost.com/2017/10/17/a-final-goodbye-to-the-legendary-celeb-haven-le-cirque/ | work=[[New York Post]] | date=October 17, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Introduction'''

The [http://www.accor.com/fileadmin/user_upload/Contenus_Accor/Presse/Country/Asia_Pacific/PR_2011/201108_Survey_Accor_Business_Traveller_Research_2011_Report.pdf Accor Asia Pacific Business Traveller Research] is a study by [[Accor]] Asia Pacific, seeking to better understand the travel and behavioural preferences of business travellers in the [[Asia Pacific]] region. This research is now in its second year and has been updated to reflect market conditions unique to the Asia Pacific region. Accor partnered with [http://www.cimigo.com/ Cimigo Ltd], a research consultancy in Asia Pacific, to conduct the research, with 10,437 Asia Pacific based business travellers from [[Australia]], [[China]], [[Hong Kong]], [[India]], [[Indonesia]], [[New Zealand]], [[Singapore]] and [[Thailand]] were surveyed online about their travel habits in the first half of 2011, and their planned [[business travel]] for the remainder of the year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Singapore/Hong Kong top destinations for Asia-Pacific business travel|url=http://www.ttgasia.com/article.php?article_id=2035|accessdate=27 October 2011|newspaper=TTG Asia|date=3 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The three key areas of that the study covered include&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Accor Asia Pacific Business Traveller Research 2011|url=http://www.platma.org/index.php/mod.conts/mem.detalle/id.1769/lang.en/chk.4e329e4a0a155626f4fd769bddf5b1d7|accessdate=27 October 2011|newspaper=platma|date=29 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Business travel in the first 6 months of 2011, and planned for the last 6 months of 2011, the process of planning the business trip and the usage of hotel facilities.

&lt;br /&gt;
'''Findings'''

Singapore and Hong Kong tie for the most visited destination by APAC business travelers in the first half of 2011, with Thailand and China come in third and fourth respectively.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Cheung|first=Tim|title=Business travelers: Who spends the most?|url=http://www.cnngo.com/explorations/life/habits-apac-business-travelers-unraveled-212929|accessdate=27 October 2011|newspaper=CNNGo.com|date=28 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; For the second half of the year, Singapore (39%) and Hong Kong (38%) are also the most likely destinations for business travel.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Chan|first=Rachel|title=S'pore business travellers work till late|url=http://www.asiaone.com/Business/News/Office/Story/A1Story20110728-291406.html|accessdate=27 October 2011|newspaper=AsiaOne|date=28 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;br /&gt;
In terms of the number of trips made, Asia Pacific business travellers took an average of 6.3 business trips in the first 6 months of 2011. The average number of trips differed by country of residence, with Chinese (8.7 trips), Indian (7.3 trips) and Singaporean (7.1 trips) business travellers ranking the highest, and Thais (5.0 trips), Australians (5.2 trips) and New Zealanders (5.2 trips) ranked lowest.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Cheung|first=Tim|title=Business travelers: Who spends the most?|url=http://www.cnngo.com/explorations/life/habits-apac-business-travelers-unraveled-212929|accessdate=27 October 2011|newspaper=CNNGo.com|date=28 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; When narrowed down to demographics, the research found that Male business travellers (7.0 trips) were on the road more frequently than females (4.5 trips).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Cheung|first=Tim|title=Business travelers: Who spends the most?|url=http://www.cnngo.com/explorations/life/habits-apac-business-travelers-unraveled-212929|accessdate=27 October 2011|newspaper=CNNGo.com|date=28 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; That said, Hong Kong has the largest percentage of female business travelers (36%), followed by Thailand (33%). At the extreme end, only 7 percent of the Indian respondents were women.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Cheung|first=Tim|title=Business travelers: Who spends the most?|url=http://www.cnngo.com/explorations/life/habits-apac-business-travelers-unraveled-212929|accessdate=27 October 2011|newspaper=CNNGo.com|date=28 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; In terms of daily hotel budget during business travel, Asia Pacific's executives average at US$121 with Australian business travelers leading the pack at US$158 per night. Singaporean and Hong Kongers spend US$134 and US$132 respectively. On the other hand, Chinese business travelers are more frugal, spending a mere US$99 a night.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Cheung|first=Tim|title=Business travelers: Who spends the most?|url=http://www.cnngo.com/explorations/life/habits-apac-business-travelers-unraveled-212929|accessdate=27 October 2011|newspaper=CNNGo.com|date=28 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Both Singapore and Chinese business travellers (82%) are most likely to work at the hotel during their business trips. They are followed by Hong Kong business travellers (75%).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Chan|first=Rachel|title=S'pore business travellers work till late|url=http://www.asiaone.com/Business/News/Office/Story/A1Story20110728-291406.html|accessdate=27 October 2011|newspaper=AsiaOne|date=28 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hotel facilities-wise, Indian business travelers are most likely to use both fitness (85%) and spa facilities (64%) than any other nationalities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Cheung|first=Tim|title=Business travelers: Who spends the most?|url=http://www.cnngo.com/explorations/life/habits-apac-business-travelers-unraveled-212929|accessdate=27 October 2011|newspaper=CNNGo.com|date=28 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;br /&gt;
When it comes to booking travel accommodation, respondents overwhelmingly preferred booking directly online with the hotel brand (57 per cent) followed by the secretary in the company (40%), while offline travel agents were used only by a minority (16%).

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2045">'''Andrea Mazzucchi''' (born March 19, 1966) in [[Rome]] is an [[Italian Americans|Italian American]] entrepreneur, network architect, and computer specialist

He played a significant role in the early development of Internet in [[Italy]], and other countries in Eastern Europe, such as [[Croatia]].

Being interested in the regulatory side, as well as the technical, he also played a key role in the Internet governance of Italy since 1985. He co-founded,  in 1998, the [[ccTLD]] ".it" policy board (Naming Authority), where he eventually became Chair of the Board of Directors. In 2004, once the Naming Authority evolved into the Rules Committee, he was one of the appointed members.

Focused since the very beginning toward the [[Open Source]], in 1992 he co-founded Nexus, the first [[ISP]] in Italy based exclusively on [[Linux]] and open technologies.

In 1993, Mazzucchi co-founded Gedi, one of the first companies in Italy for [[distance learning]].

In 1995, he founded Istria On Line, the first ISP in Croatia, and worked on Internet pilot projects in [[Bulgaria]] and [[Hungary]], mostly establishing [[TCP/IP]] over [[X.25]] Internet connections for international businesses.

He is also an active member of the Internet community, being co-founder, with [[Giancarlo Livraghi]], of [[ALCEI]], initially conceived as the Italian branch of [[Electronic Frontier Foundation|EFF]].
Moreover, he is co-founder of the Italian Chapter of [[Internet Society|ISOC]] where he served on the first Board of Directors.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="12267">An '''arbitration award''' (or '''arbitral award''') is a determination on the merits by an [[arbitration tribunal]] in an [[arbitration]], and is analogous to a [[Judgment (law)|judgment]] in a [[court]] of law. It is referred to as an 'award' even where all of the claimant's claims fail (and thus no money needs to be paid by either party), or the award is of a non-monetary nature.

==Damages and other remedies==

Although arbitration awards are characteristically an award of damages against a party, tribunals usually have a range of remedies that can form a part of the award.
#the tribunal may order the payment of a sum of money (conventional damages)
#the tribunal may make a "[[declaration (law)|declaration]]" as to any matter to be determined in the proceedings
#in most jurisdictions, the tribunal has the same power as a court to:
##order a party to do or refrain from doing something ("[[injunction|injunctive relief]]")
##to order [[specific performance]] of a contract
##to order the [[rectification (law)|rectification]], setting aside or cancellation of a deed or other document.

== Enforcement of Arbitration Awards ==

Arbitration is particularly popular as a means of [[alternative dispute resolution|dispute resolution]] in the commercial sphere (for a summary of the various arenas in which arbitration is usually chosen, see the specific article on "[[arbitration]]"). One of the reasons for doing so is that, in international trade, it is often easier to enforce an arbitration award in a foreign country than it is to enforce a judgment of the court.

Under the [[Convention on the Recognition and Enforcement of Foreign Arbitral Awards|New York Convention 1958]], an award issued in a contracting state can generally be freely enforced in any other contracting state, only subject to certain, limited defences. Those defences are:

#a party to the arbitration agreement was, under the law applicable to him, under some incapacity, or the arbitration agreement was not valid under its governing law;
#a party was not given proper notice of the appointment of the arbitrator or of the arbitration proceedings, or was otherwise unable to present its case;
#the award deals with an issue not contemplated by or not falling within the terms of the submission to arbitration, or contains matters beyond the scope of the arbitration (subject to the proviso that an award which contains decisions on such matters may be enforced to the extent that it contains decisions on matters submitted to arbitration which can be separated from those matters not so submitted);
#the composition of the arbitral authority was not in accordance with the agreement of the parties or, failing such agreement, with the law of the place where the hearing took place (the "[[lex loci arbitri]]");
#the award has not yet become binding upon the parties, or has been set aside or suspended by a competent authority, either in the country where the arbitration took place, or pursuant to the law of the arbitration agreement;
#the subject matter of the award was not capable of resolution by arbitration; or
#enforcement would be contrary to "public policy".

Virtually every significant commercial country in the world is a party to the Convention, but relatively few countries have a comprehensive network for cross-border enforcement of judgments of the court.&lt;ref&gt;Although some regions have multi-lateral arrangements which have a similar effect over a smaller area, such as the [[European Union]]'s [[Brussels Regime|Brussels and Lugano Conventions]], the [[Commonwealth of Nations|Commonwealth]] countries have a multiplicity of reciprocal enforcement of judgments states, and many [[Federation|Federal]] legal systems employ the "[[Full Faith and Credit Clause|full faith and credit]]" doctrine.&lt;/ref&gt; Hence in many countries, particularly in [[emerging markets]], a foreign arbitration award is much easier to enforce than an award of the court. For example, it is very difficult to enforce foreign judgments in the former [[Commonwealth of Independent States|CIS]] countries, but it is considerably easier to enforce awards of an arbitration tribunal.

The other characteristic of cross-border enforcement of arbitration awards that makes them appealing to commercial parties is that they are not limited to awards of damages. Whereas in most countries only monetary judgments are enforceable in the cross-border context, no such restrictions are imposed on arbitration awards and so it is theoretically possible (although unusual in practice) to obtain an [[injunction]] or an order for [[specific performance]] in an arbitration proceeding which could then be enforced in another New York Convention contracting state.

The New York Convention is not actually the only treaty dealing with cross-border enforcement of arbitration awards. The earlier Geneva Convention on the Execution of Foreign Arbitral Awards 1927 [http://interarb.com/vl/g_co1927] remains in force, but the success of the New York Convention means that the Geneva Convention is rarely utilised in practise.

===Arbitration with sovereign governments===
In judicial proceedings in many countries, governments enjoy [[sovereign immunity]] from suit. However, governments can submit to arbitration, and certain international conventions exist in relation to the enforcement of awards against nation states.
* The Washington Convention 1965 relates to settlement of investment disputes between nation states and citizens of other countries. The Convention created the [[International Centre for Settlement of Investment Disputes]] (or ICSID). The Convention was primarily designed to create investor confidence, and to promote inward investment into developing countries. Compared to other arbitration institutions, relatively few awards have been rendered under ICSID.&lt;ref&gt;Tupman, "Case Studies in the Jurisdiction of the International Centre for Settlement of Investment Disputes" (1986) 35 ICLQ 813&lt;/ref&gt;
* The Algiers Declaration of 1981 established the Iran-US Claims Tribunal to adjudicate claims of American corporations and individuals in relation to expropriated property during the Islamic revolution in Iran in 1979. Although formed in good faith,&lt;ref&gt;The U.S. Government froze billions of dollars' worth of Iranian assets and wanted to set up an impartial tribunal to determine claims to compensation out of those assets by corporations who had been subject to expropriation without compensation in Iran.&lt;/ref&gt; the tribunal has not been a notable success, and has even been held by an English court to be [[void (law)|void]] under its own governing law.&lt;ref&gt;''Dallal v Bank Mellat'' [1986] 1 QB 441&lt;/ref&gt;

==Nomenclature==

Although it is common to talk of an arbitration award as a single concept, in most legal jurisdictions there are several sub-categories of award.
#a '''provisional''' award is an award on a provisional basis subject to the final determination of the merits.&lt;ref&gt;In the United Kingdom, see [[Arbitration Act 1996]], section 39.&lt;/ref&gt;
#a '''partial''' award is an award of only part of the claims or cross claims which are brought, or a determination of only certain issues between the parties. Importantly, this leaves it open to the parties to either resolve or to continue to arbitrate (or litigate) the remaining issues.&lt;ref&gt;In the United Kingdom, see [[Arbitration Act 1996]], section 47.&lt;/ref&gt;
#an '''agreed''' award is usually in the form of a settlement between the parties of their dispute (the equivalent of a judgment by consent).&lt;ref&gt;In the United Kingdom, see [[Arbitration Act 1996]], section 51.&lt;/ref&gt; But by embodying the settlement in the form of an award it can have a number of advantages.&lt;ref&gt;For example, the losing party may only be entitled to an indemnity where there is an actual award under a policy of insurance.  An award is also easier to enforce than a settlement agreement, and gives rise to an [[estoppel]] against re-litigating settled issues.  Occasionally having an award rather than a settlement agreement may confer tax advantages.&lt;/ref&gt;
#a '''reasoned''' award is not a sub-category of award, but is used to describe an award where the tribunal sets out its reasoning for its decision.&lt;ref&gt;In the United Kingdom, section 52 of the [[Arbitration Act 1996]] provides that awards must be reasoned unless the parties have agreed that the tribunal may dispense with giving reasons.&lt;/ref&gt;
#an '''additional''' award is an award which the tribunal, by its own initiative or on the application of a party makes in respect of any claim which was presented to the tribunal but was not resolved under the principal award.&lt;ref&gt;In the United Kingdom, see [[Arbitration Act 1996]], section 57.&lt;/ref&gt;
#a '''draft''' award is not an award as such, and is not binding on the parties until confirmed by the tribunal.&lt;ref&gt;Many tribunals make a practice of permitting the parties to see a draft award to allow basic factual errors or arithmetic mistakes to be flushed out.  The practice helps reduce appeals on trivial technical points.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legal requirements==

The legal requirements relating to the making of awards vary from country to country and, in some cases, according to the terms of the arbitration agreement. Although in most countries, awards can be oral, this is relatively uncommon and they are usually delivered in writing.

By way of example, in the United Kingdom, the following are requirements under the Arbitration Act 1996 which the award must comply with, unless the parties agree to vary them under section 52 of the Act:
#the award must be in writing and signed by all of the arbitrators assenting to the award (dissenting minority arbitrators need not sign unless the parties agree that they must);
#the award must contain reasons;
#the award must state the "seat" of the arbitration (the place where the arbitration took place); and
#the award must state the date upon which it is made. This is important for the calculation of interest.

Many countries have similar requirements, but most permit the parties to vary the conditions, which reflects the fact that arbitration is a party-driven process.

==Appeals==

It is sometimes said that arbitration awards are not normally subject to appeal (often another reason given in favour of using arbitration), but that is usually an oversimplification.

Most countries in the world allow arbitration awards to be "challenged" in the court, although they usually limit the circumstances in which such challenges may be brought. The two most commonly permitted grounds of challenge are:
#that the tribunal did not have jurisdiction to make the award;&lt;ref&gt;for example, that there was no binding agreement to submit to arbitration&lt;/ref&gt; or
#serious irregularity on the part of the tribunal.&lt;ref&gt;"Serious irregularity" covers a multitude of sins, from accepting a [[bribe]] and failing to hear the arguments of one party, to have an improper number of arbitrators or ruling evidence inadmissible when it should not have done so.&lt;/ref&gt;

Arbitration awards are non-justiciable. Distinguish from an "[[expert determination]]" where the expert determines a matter of fact (which is ordinarily not subject to any form of appeal at all, except in cases of obvious bias or manifest error or bad faith).

In addition, although not by way of challenge, many countries permit appeals on a point of law (although almost no countries permit appeals to be made in relation to findings of fact). This right is usually closely circumscribed to avoid undermining the commercial efficacy of arbitration.&lt;ref&gt;For example, in the United Kingdom, appeal on a point of law can only be made with the leave of the court, and the court will only give leave in very specific and limited circumstances.&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3860">An '''Asset Retirement Obligation''' (ARO) is a legal obligation associated with the retirement of a tangible long-lived asset in which the timing or method of settlement may be conditional on a future event, the occurrence of which may not be within the control of the entity burdened by the obligation. In the United States, ARO accounting is specified by [[Statements of Financial Accounting Standards|Statement of Financial Accounting Standards]] (SFAS, or FAS) 143,&lt;ref name="SFAS 143 text"&gt;[http://www.fasb.org/pdf/aop_FAS143.pdf SFAS 143 as amended]&lt;/ref&gt; which is Topic 410-20 in the Accounting Standards Codification published by the [[Financial Accounting Standards Board]]. Entities covered by [[International Financial Reporting Standards]] (IFRS) apply a standard called [[IAS 37]] to AROs, where the AROs are called "provisions". ARO accounting is particularly significant for remediation work needed to restore a property, such as decontaminating a nuclear power plant site, removing underground fuel storage tanks, cleanup around an oil well, or removal of improvements to a site. It does not apply to unplanned cleanup costs, such as costs incurred as a result of an accident.

Firms must recognize the ARO liability in the period in which it was incurred, such as at the time of acquisition or construction. The liability equals the present value of the expected cost of retirement/remediation. An asset equal to the initial liability is added to the [[balance sheet]], and depreciated over the life of the asset. The result is an increase in both assets and liabilities, while the total expected cost is recognized over time, with the accrual steadily increasing on a compounded basis.&lt;ref name="JoA"&gt;[http://www.journalofaccountancy.com/Issues/2001/Dec/AccountingForAssetRetirementObligations.htm Explanation of AROs from the Journal of Accountancy]&lt;/ref&gt;

==An ARO example==
A company builds a gas station, with underground tanks to store the fuel. The tanks have an estimated life of 40 years (or, alternatively, the station site is leased for 40 years). The current cost to remove the tanks is $15,000. The company estimates future inflation for this type of work to be 2.5% per year. The company's credit-adjusted risk-free rate (cost of borrowing) is 9%.

The estimated future cost of removing the tanks in 40 years is $15,000 * (1.025 ^ 40) = $40,275.96. The present value of this cost is $40,275.96 / (1.09 ^ 40) = $1,282.29. At installation of the tanks, the company books an asset retirement cost (asset) and an asset retirement obligation (liability) of $1,282.29. The asset is [[depreciation|depreciated]], usually straight-line, over 40 years (depreciation expense of $32.06 per year). The liability is [[accretion (finance)|accreted]] (interest for each period is calculated and added to the balance), using the interest method. (Accretion expense would be $115.41 the first year, $125.79 the second year, etc.) Over the 40 year life, the liability thereby increases to $40,275.96. At retirement of the tank, the expenses actually incurred to remove the tank are booked against the ARO, and a gain or loss is recognized for the difference.

The increase of assets and liabilities by $1,282 will affect financial ratios, for example [[return on assets]] will decline, [[debt-to-equity ratio]] will increase, etc.

Calculations are somewhat different under IAS 37, because the discount rate is regularly recalculated during the life of the ARO to reflect current market conditions. Whenever the rate changes, the present value is recalculated, and both the asset and liability are adjusted by the amount of the difference.

'''Ayavalla Plantation''' was a [[quail hunting plantation]] located in northwest [[Leon County, Florida]], established by [[John Henry Howard Phipps]], son of [[John Shaffer Phipps]] of the prominent [[Phipps family]].

Ayavalla was the Indian word used by Ellen Call Long for Lake Jackson. Long was the previous resident of nearby [[Orchard Pond Plantation]] and daughter of Governor [[Richard K. Call|Richard Keith Call]].

Upon John Shaffer Phipps' death in 1958, Orchard Pond Plantation and {{convert|1200|acre|abbr=on}} were passed on to grandson Colin Phipps, and grandson John E. Phipps was given {{convert|2100|acre|km2}} on Ox Bottom Road.&lt;ref&gt;Paisley, Clifton; ''From Cotton To Quail'', University of Florida Press, c1968, pp. 83-84.&lt;/ref&gt; 

Adjacent plantations:
* [[Luna Plantation]] to the north
* [[Meridian Plantation]] to the east

Ayavalla and the neighboring property of [[Elinor Klapp-Phipps Park]] host part of the [[Red Hills Horse Trials]].

Khan is known for his close ties with the former government of [[Laisenia Qarase]], which was deposed in the [[2006 Fijian coup d'état|military coup]] of 5 December 2006.  He has a tense relationship with the [[Republic of Fiji Military Forces]], which predates the coup.

The [[Fiji Sun]] reported on 25 October 2006 that [[Colonel]] [[Pita Driti]], the Land Force Commander, had condemned Khan for employing former [[Counter Revolutionary Warfare Unit]] (CRW) soldiers as bodyguards.  The CRW was implicated in a [[Mutinies of the 2000 Fijian coup d'état|mutiny]] which left eight soldiers dead on 2 November 2000.  Driti and [[Captain (land)|Captain]] [[Esala Teleni]], the Deputy Commander of the Military, issued a veiled threat to Khan,  warning that the Military was in a position to stop former CRW soldiers from working for him.

Following the coup, armed soldiers raided the PCX office and Khan's private residence on 9 December 2006, and arrested six bodyguards who had been CRW soldiers. Documents and hard drives were removed from the office, according to Colonel Driti. Khan's house was raided again on 12 December. All of these raids took place while Khan was out of Fiji.

==Early life==
Ballu Khan was born in [[Nalomolomo]] on [[Nairai Island]] in 1959. His father died in the Kadavulevu ship disaster when he was 4. He graduated with a master's degree in Commerce from the [[University of the South Pacific]]. He became a school teacher and taught at [[Vunisea]] and [[Laucala]] Bay Secondary School. He then trained as a chartered accountant and became an investigator for New Zealand's [[Inland Revenue Department (New Zealand)|Inland Revenue Department]].

==Business==
Khan formed Tui Consulting in [[Melbourne]], [[Australia]] in 1997. Tui Consulting's business was assisting utilities and public sector organizations implement SAP software solutions. Tui Consulting has undertaken SAP projects in New Zealand, Australia, United States, Canada, and Singapore. In 2002 he moved the company's headquarters to [[Tacoma, Washington|Tacoma]], [[Washington (U.S. state)|Washington]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Australian Company moving HQ to Takoma|url=http://seattle.bizjournals.com/seattle/stories/2002/06/03/daily54.html|website=www.bizjournals.com|publisher=www.bizjournals.com|accessdate=15 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Axon Group]], a business transformation consultancy acquired Tui Consulting for a price, reported to be up to $(US)11.75 in December 2005

It was reported in February 2005 that Tui Consulting was being sued by [[Singapore]]’s largest electricity retailer, SP Services, for problems related to TUI’s implementation of a SAP computer system. The dispute was reportedly settled in 2005. Reports quoted the utility as saying that it encountered large-scale billing problems beginning in January 2000, eventually affecting about 144,000 of the 1.2 million electricity accounts. Tui Consulting denied the claims and filed a countersuit for $3 million, blaming SP Services for the problems.

The [[New Zealand Herald]] reported (6 November 2007)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Ballu Khan Lively Figure in Business, Politics|url=http://www.nzherald.co.nz/section/1/story.cfm?c_id=1&amp;objectid=10474258|website=New Zealand Herald|publisher=New Zealand Herald|accessdate=15 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; that Khan had been a controversial figure in Fiji business and political circles. PCX of which he owned 49% won a US$9.2 million contract in 2004 to supply a new SAP based computer system and maintenance service to the NLTB. PCX was described by NLTB as a step to acquire greater indigenous Fijian involvement in Fiji's developing IT industry. PCX was to handle NLTB's requirements as well as to bid for other IT projects. Staff of the NLTB's IT division were transferred to PCX. The Fiji Labour Party called at the time for a commission of inquiry into the awarding of the contract to PCX. An independent audit report undertaken in 2007 by KPMG Australia criticised the NTLB for allegedly failing to conduct a proper investigation before buying the computer system. The KPMG audit report questioned the credibility of the mySap system and recommended the NLTB seriously reconsider continuing its business relations with PCX. The audit report stated that PCX faced financial difficulties and may be insolvent, with VDC having given it a loan of $(US)2.4m.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Audit Report Severely Critical of Fiji's Native Lands Trust Board|url=http://www.rnzi.com/pages/news.php?op=read&amp;id=31851|website=Radio New Zealand International|publisher=Radio New Zealand International|accessdate=15 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In April 2005 it was reported that Khan was a key figure in a bid by PCX to apply for a 3G mobile telephony wireless licence in Fiji.  Because of the alignment of PCX with NLTB, through VDC, it was put forth by the NLTB as a company that represented the interests of the indigenous Fijian people. Another interested party in the bid was Digicel, owned by [[Ireland|Irish]] telecommunications entrepreneur, Denis O'Brien.

==Sport==

Khan was identified&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=NZer 'so badly beaten in Fiji he can't speak'|url=http://www.nzherald.co.nz/section/1/story.cfm?c_id=1&amp;objectid=10474043|website=New Zealand Herald|publisher=New Zealand Herald|accessdate=15 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; in 2003 as making a "substantial" financial contribution to help the Auckland Blues rugby club retain a former All Black, Carlos Spencer, when he had been made offers by European rugby clubs. It was also reported that he supported a rugby academy in Fiji that sent young players to New Zealand.

==2007 Arrest==

Ballu Khan was one of a group of people arrested on November 3, 2007 as part of an investigation by the Fiji Police into an alleged assassination plot against members of the government. A military spokesman said that Khan resisted arrest and assaulted the officers who tried to detain him at a checkpoint in [[Lami, Fiji|Lami]]. He also said that Khan had sustained minor injuries and was under armed guard at a hospital in [[Suva]]. 0n November 21. 2007 his lawyer Peter Williams Q.C. stated that Khan was seriously ill in hospital as a result of being assaulted by police and the deadline to charge him with offences related to the alleged assassination plot against national leaders had expired.

On November 22, 2007, [[Fiji Live]] quoted Khan as saying that people of high status within the interim Government of Fiji and the military held grudges against him. On November 25, 2007 a lawyer filed a writ in the Fiji High Court seeking compensation of $F40 million. The writ claimed Khan's treatment amounted to torture and reckless disregard for his health, and his civil rights were abused.  Fiji's interim attorney-general, Aiyaz Sayed-Khaiyum, stated the government of Fiji would defend the claim.

[[Image:BankStatementChequing.png|right|thumb|250px|Example of a [[checking account]] statement for a fictional bank.]]
A '''bank statement''' or '''account [[Financial statement|statement]]''' is a summary of [[financial transaction]]s which have occurred over a given period on a [[bank account]] held by a person or business with a [[financial institution]].

Bank statements have historically been and continue to be typically printed on one or several pieces of paper and either mailed directly to the account holder, or kept at the financial institution's local [[branch (banking)|branch]] for pick-up. In recent years there has been a shift towards paperless, electronic statements, and some financial institutions offer direct download into account holders accounting software.

Some [[automated teller machines|ATM]]s offer the possibility to print, at any time, a condensed version of a bank statement, commonly called a '''transaction history''', or a transaction history may be viewed on the financial institution's website or available via [[telephone banking]]. Transaction history may also be shared with other financial institutions when the account holder gives permission through [[open banking]] to provide services such as [[account aggregation]].

Historically, bank statements were paper statements produced monthly, [[Fiscal quarter|quarterly]] or even [[annual report|annually]]. Since the introduction of computers in banks in the 1960s,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rbc.com/history/anytimeanywhere/automating-detail.html#5 Royal Bank of Canada - History]&lt;/ref&gt; bank statements have generally been produced monthly. Bank statements for accounts with small transaction volumes, such as [[investment]]s or [[savings account]]s, are usually produced less frequently. Depending on the financial institution, bank statements may also include certain features such as the cancelled [[cheque]]s (or their images) that cleared through the account during the statement period.

Some financial institutions use the occasion of posting bank statements to include notices such as changes in [[fees]] or [[interest rate]]s or to include [[Insert (advertising)|promotional material]].

Today, the monthly mailing of bank statements is the norm in many countries. It is not customary in some countries, such as Japan, where individual account holders are expected to keep track of deposits, withdrawals, and balances using their own passbooks at ATMs.

==Electronic statements==
With the wider access to the Internet and [[online banking]], bank statements (also known as electronic statements or e-statements) can be viewed online, and downloaded or printed by the customer. To reduce the cost of postage and the generation of paper bank statements, some financial institutions encourage their customers to receive bank statements electronically, for example by charging a fee for paper statements. This may be as attachments to emails or, as a security measure, as a reminder that a new statement is available on the financial institution's website. Whether such statements are transmitted as attachments or from the website, they are commonly generated in [[PDF format]], to reduce the ability of the recipient to electronically alter the statement.

Due to [[identity theft]] concerns, an electronic statement may not be seen as a dangerous alternative against physical theft as it does not contain tangible personal information, and does not require extra safety measures of disposal such as [[Paper shredder|shredding]]. However, an electronic statement can be easier to obtain than a physical one through computer fraud, data interception and/or theft of storage media.

A '''cash advance''' is a service provided by most [[credit card]] and [[charge card]] issuers. The service allows cardholders to withdraw [[cash]], either through an [[automatic teller machine|ATM]] or over the counter at a bank or other financial agency, up to a certain limit. For a credit card, this will be the credit limit (or some percentage of it).

Cash advances often incur a fee of 3 to 5 percent of the amount being borrowed. When made on a credit card, the interest is often higher than other credit card transactions. The interest compounds daily starting from the day cash is borrowed.

Some "purchases" made with a credit card of items that are viewed as cash are also considered to be cash advances in accordance with the credit card network's guidelines, thereby incurring the higher interest rate and the lack of the grace period. These often include [[money order]]s, [[Debit_card#Prepaid_debit_cards|prepaid debit cards]], [[lottery]] tickets, [[gaming chip]]s, and certain taxes and fees paid to certain governments. However, should the merchant not disclose the actual nature of the transactions, these will be processed as regular credit card transactions. Many merchants have passed on the credit card processing fees to the credit card holders in spite of the credit card network's guidelines, which state the credit card holders should not have any extra fee for doing a transaction with a credit card.

Under card scheme rules, a credit card holder presenting an accepted form of identification must be issued a cash advance over the counter at any bank which issues that type of credit card, even if the cardholder cannot give their [[personal identification number|PIN]].

'''Clock Software''' is a private limited company developing software and hardware [[solution]]s for the [[hospitality industry]] - property management system, restaurant point of sale, online booking engine, channel manager, self-service kiosk, mobile hotel app. Its headquarters is in London, UK.

== History ==
Clock Software was incorporated in 1994 in [[Varna]], [[Bulgaria]], under the name Clock Ltd (Клок ООД). Initially, the company specialized in selling hardware and peripherals but soon switched its focus to the development of hotel software. In 1996 Clock launched their first property management system - ClockFront for [[Microsoft Windows|Windows]]. At the time, a huge privatisation was going on as part of the transition of the country to [[democracy]] and [[market economy]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Ivanov|first1=Stanislav H|last2=Dimitrova|first2=Miroslava|title=Tourism Management and Planning in Bulgaria|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/228245420_Tourism_Management_and_Planning_in_Bulgaria|website=Researchgate|accessdate=2 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; All hotels, previously owned by the state, were changing ownership and needed new software to replace previous, often centralised, management systems. Clock Software took the chance to offer their software to the newly privatised hotels.&lt;ref name="Clockwork Evolution"&gt;{{cite news|author1=Spasov, Spas|title=Еволюция по часовник|trans-title=Clockwork Evolution|url=http://www.capital.bg/biznes/predpriemach/2010/11/26/1000860_evoljuciia_po_chasovnik/|accessdate=9 May 2016|work=www.capital.bg|issue=Entrepreneur|date=November 26, 2010|language=bg}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2006 Clock Software started to expand to countries outside Bulgaria and opened offices in Romania (2007) and Croatia (2008). The first markets where their products were adopted were Romania, Macedonia and Croatia.&lt;ref name="Clockwork Evolution" /&gt;

In 2010 Clock took the decision to create a completely new hospitality software suite based on [[cloud technology]]. The new product was built around the idea of consolidation of separate applications into one cloud-based platform and switching from data-focused to guest-centered software model.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Традиционният хотелски софтуер е мъртъв|trans-title=Traditional hotel software is dead|url=http://www.horemag.bg/print.php?storyid=1014935|accessdate=9 May 2016|work=HOtels &amp; REstaurants MAGazine|date=December 21, 2010|language=bg}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Cloud Hotel PMS: A paradigm shift from managing rooms to engaging with guests|url=https://www.raconteur.net/business/cloud-hotel-pms-a-paradigm-shift-from-managing-rooms-to-engaging-with-guests|accessdate=2 March 2017|work=Future of Hospitlaity report|publisher=Raconteur Media|date=22 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; A new branch was registered in [[London, UK]] under the name of Clock Software Ltd. to take over the international development and the distribution of the cloud-based software products, while the Bulgarian branch remained in charge of software development and support.
Clock Software launched their first cloud product, the free Internet reservation system InnHand, in 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Clock launched new online booking software (in Bulgarian)|url=http://www.subway.bg/admin/resources/uploaded/News/CapitalDaily-2012-06-14-103.pdf|accessdate=9 May 2016|work=CapitalDaily|date=June 14, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author1=Prabu, Karthick|title=InnHand brings mobile, web and Facebook reservation system for B&amp;Bs, guest houses, villas - Tnooz|url=https://www.tnooz.com/TLabs-InnHand-mobile-web-Facebook-reservation-system-for-Bed-Breakfast-inns-guest-houses-villas|work=Tnooz|issue=The TLabs Showcase|date=February 26, 2013|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2013 they launched the hotel management platform Clock PMS. A year later InnHand was discontinued and the company focused entirely on the new system. In 2016, the company released their first hardware device, a self-service kiosk.

== Distribution and partners ==
Its Windows-based installable software solutions Clock Software offers in Eastern Europe, while the latest cloud-based hotel management platform, Clock PMS, is available globally. Clock PMS has customers in 50+ countries (as of end of 2016) with [[Lark Hotels]] and [[McMillan Hotels]] among them. In 2015 Clock PMS was featured in the annual report by [[Software Advice]] "Hotel Software User View report - 2015"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Short|first1=Taylor|title=Hotel Management Software UserView - 2015|journal=Software Advice|date=April 13, 2015|url=http://www.softwareadvice.com/hotel-management/userview/report-2015/|accessdate=9 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; and in 2016 Clock Software was included in the [[Grant Thornton]]'s report "Emerging clouds in hotel technology | Spotlight on cloud-based PMS"  &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Emerging clouds in hotel technology - Spotlight on cloud-based PMS|publisher=[[Grant Thornton]] UK LLP|page=9|url=http://www.grantthornton.co.uk/globalassets/1.-member-firms/united-kingdom/pdf/publication/2016/emerging-clouds-in-hotel-technology.pdf|accessdate=9 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2749">'''Daniel Janssen''' (born 15 April 1936 in [[Brussels]]) is a [[Belgium|Belgian]] businessman.

== Biography ==

He is a son of [[Charles-Emmanuel Janssen]], liberal deputy of [[Walloon Brabant]], and [[Maya Boël]], daughter of the Vice-president of the Senate [[Pol Clovis Boël|Pol Boël]]. He married [[Thérèse Bracht]], and together they have three children, Charles-Antoine Janssen (b. 1971), Nicolas Janssen (b. 1974), and Edouard Janssen (b. 1978).

===Speaker of the House===
In September 2007, a committee questioned Speaker [[Patricia Etteh]] about her spending of ₦628 million ($4.8m) on home renovation and automobiles. She denied wrongdoing, but many representatives were unhappy with her attempts to defend herself, blows were traded on the floor of the House, and Etteh had to be escorted from the chamber.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title= Nigerian MPs brawl over speaker |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/7005402.stm |work= |publisher=BBC News |date=20 September 2007 |accessdate=4 November 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Former President [[Olusegun Obasanjo]] and many top PDP members continued to back her,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=Philip |last=Nyam |title=Etteh: Countdown To October 16 |url=http://www.leadershipnigeria.com/product_info.php?products_id=15208 |work=Leadership |publisher=Leadership Newspapers Group |accessdate=14 October 2007 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110713192609/http://www.leadershipnigeria.com/product_info.php?products_id=15208 |archivedate=13 July 2011 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt; but a large segment of the party, led by Lawan and including Bankole, called for her resignation.&lt;ref name=v2&gt;{{cite news |title= After Etteh, PDP's our next target—Integrity group's Farouk Lawan |url= http://www.vanguardngr.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=1410&amp;Itemid=0 |work=Vanguard Online Edition |publisher=Vanguard Media |date=3 November 2007 |accessdate=3 November 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It was reported that Bankole, among multiple other contenders, hoped to succeed her as early as 5 October 2007.&lt;ref name=trib&gt;{{cite news |first=Olusola |last=Sanni |title= N628m: Who Blinks First?|url=http://www.tribune.com.ng/06102007/nation.html |work=Nigerian Tribune online |publisher= African Newspapers of Nigeria|date=5 October 1007 |accessdate=3 November 2007 }} {{Dead link|date=October 2010|bot=H3llBot}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After Etteh's resignation from the post on 30 October (along with her deputy, who was also caught up in the scandal),&lt;ref name=bbc&gt;{{cite news |title= Nigeria speaker goes in graft row |url= http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/7069654.stm|work= |publisher=[[BBC News]] |date=30 October 2007 |accessdate=3 November 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Integrity Group]] (anti-Etteh) member Terngu Tsegba became interim speaker.&lt;ref name=dt&gt;{{cite news|first=Mohammed S |last=Shehu |author2=Nasiru L.

====Nomination====
On 1 November, he was elected to succeed Etteh.&lt;ref name=v2/&gt;  The election began at 10.30am.  The House was short of the statutory 360 members because three (Moses Segun Oladimeji, Joe Anota and Aminu Shuaibu Safana) died. Two constituencies were yet to elect their representatives. 328 of the 355 members voted.&lt;ref name=thenation&gt;{{cite news |first=Lateef |last=Ibrahim |title=PDP loses battle to choose Speaker |url=http://www.thenationonlineng.net/archive2/tblnews_Detail.php?id=36043 |work=The Nation Archive |publisher=Vintage Press Limited |date=2 November 2007 |accessdate=20 February 2015 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150220064235/http://www.thenationonlineng.net/archive2/tblnews_Detail.php?id=36043 |archivedate=20 February 2015 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Samson Osagie]] of [[Edo State]] nominated Bankole for the post of Speaker, and [[Lynda Ikpeazu]] of [[Anambra State]] seconded the proposal. His challenger was [[Osun State]] Representative [[George Jolaoye]], whom he beat by 304 votes to 20 (and 4 abstentions). Etteh was among those who voted against Bankole.&lt;ref name=sun2&gt;{{cite news |first=James |last=Ojo |title=Reps get 37-year-old bachelor as speaker |url= http://www.sunnewsonline.com/national-02-11-2007-001.htm |work=The Sun News On-line |publisher= The Sun Publishing|date=2 November 2007 |accessdate=3 November 2007 }} {{Dead link|date=October 2010|bot=H3llBot}}&lt;/ref&gt; The new deputy speaker was [[Usman Bayero Nafada]].&lt;ref name=v/&gt;  Bankole was declared speaker at 1.30pm.&lt;ref name=thenation/&gt;

In his acceptance speech, entitled "We Stand Upon The Threshold of History",&lt;ref name=thenation/&gt; Bankole said "I am taking over the mantle of leadership at a very difficult time. But these are hard times, we need to build confidence again and assure the populace that we are still their representatives. I want an independent house that Nigerians will be proud of, this is my first task."&lt;ref name=dt/&gt;

====Tenure====
One week after his election, political opponents claimed that Bankole had not completed his [[National Youth Service Corps]] (N.Y.S.C) service, which is mandatory for all Nigerian university graduates under thirty years of age when they graduate, and called for his resignation over the issue.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=Peter |last=Clottey |title=Nigeria Opponents Accuse New Parliament Speaker of Dodging Youth Service |url=http://www.voanews.com/english/Africa/2007-11-08-voa9.cfm |work=[[Voice of America]] news |publisher=[[Broadcasting Board of Governors]] |date=8 November 2007 |accessdate=17 November 2007 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071115210928/http://voanews.com/english/Africa/2007-11-08-voa9.cfm |archivedate=15 November 2007 |deadurl=yes |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt; Bankole provided his N.Y.S.C discharge certificate, ending the rumour.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first= |last= |title=Nigeria's Reps Speaker Reacts on NYSC Saga |url=http://www.leadershipnigeria.com/product_info.php?products_id=17889&amp;osCsid=970b00041f95995bf21f40599ecefb76 |work=Leadership online |publisher=Leadership Newspapers Group |accessdate=17 November 2007 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080109202217/http://www.leadershipnigeria.com/product_info.php?products_id=17889&amp;osCsid=4b74185abd257a322da2d23a5bf6a475 |archivedate=9 January 2008 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt;
On 22 June 2010 Bankole suspended 11 members of parliament indefinitely for disorderliness and fighting in the house.&lt;ref&gt;The Guardian newspaper, Thursday, 24 June 2010, page 8&lt;/ref&gt;

====Return of Unspent Funds by Government Ministries====
During his tenure, the House of Representatives as a result of performance of its oversight function ensured that Federal Ministries, Departments and Agencies (MDA's) returned unspent budgeted funds amounting to about 450 billion naira to the government treasury in 2007 while about 350 billion naira was again recovered in 2008.&lt;ref name=democracyguard&gt;{{cite news|last=PONG|first=JOAL|title=Analysis of the 2007-2011 session of the National Assembly|url=http://democracyguard.com/speical-report/analysis-of-the-2007-2011-session-of-the-national-assembly/|accessdate=20 February 2015|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150220070355/http://democracyguard.com/speical-report/analysis-of-the-2007-2011-session-of-the-national-assembly/|archivedate=20 February 2015|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In total, the House of Representatives ensured the return of about 1 trillion naira unspent funds by MDA's as part of the annual budgetary process under Bankole's speakership.  These were unprecedented in the history of oversight in Nigeria’s legislature. Up until then, MDA's did not return unspent funds. Also, the House of Representatives discovered that about 5 trillion naira generated revenue were never remitted by MDA's for the past 5 years before investigation.&lt;ref name=tribune&gt;{{cite news |title= Stewardship: How Bankole stands at point of exit |url= http://tribune.com.ng/index.php/politics/22450-stewardship-how-bankole-stands-at-point-of-exit- |work= Nigerian Tribune On-line |publisher= The Nigerian Tribune |date= 25 May 2011 |accessdate= 4 March 2012 |deadurl= yes |archiveurl= https://archive.is/20130222210843/http://tribune.com.ng/index.php/politics/22450-stewardship-how-bankole-stands-at-point-of-exit- |archivedate= 22 February 2013 |df= dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Termination of Inflated Abuja Runway Contract====
Under Bankole, the 64 billion naira contract for the second runway for the Nnamdi Azikwe Airport in Abuja was investigated and found to be grossly inflated.  The contract was thus terminated by the Federal Government of Nigeria.&lt;ref name=dailytrust&gt;{{cite news|title=Three years of Bankole’s highs, lows|url=http://www.dailytrust.com.ng/weekly/index.php/politics/7940-three-years-of-bankoles-highs-lows|accessdate=6 February 2015|work=Weekly Trust|date=20 November 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Bills====
Under him, the House of Representatives accepted 328 motions, approved 282 resolutions and passed 136 bills. These bills include the Freedom of Information(FOI) Act and Fiscal Responsibility Act which ensured that all revenue-generating agencies of government present their budgets for scrutiny every year. The agencies, which include the CBN, NNPC and Customs spent trillions of naira yearly without appropriation by the National Assembly.&lt;ref name=tribune /&gt;

====Trial====
In 2011, Bankole was tried by Nigeria's anti-corruption agency &lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Bankole to appear in court today |url=http://www.nigeriannewsservice.com/nns-news-archive/lead-stories/bankole-to-appear-in-court-today |work= |publisher=Nigerian News Service Online Edition |date=8 June 2011 |accessdate=29 February 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111123211335/http://nigeriannewsservice.com/nns-news-archive/lead-stories/bankole-to-appear-in-court-today |archivedate=23 November 2011 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=grd&gt;{{cite news |title= Taking loans cannot amount to illegal means (1) |url= http://ngrguardiannews.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=76305:-taking-loans-cannot-amount-to-illegal-means-1-&amp;catid=42:law&amp;Itemid=600|work= |publisher=The Guardian Online Edition |date=7 February 2012 |accessdate=29 February 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and was cleared of all charges. 

The judge while clearing Bankole stated that the House of Representatives incurred a loan from a bank to run its expenses, the loan was paid back fully to the bank and Bankole was not a beneficiary of the loan in any capacity therefore no crime was committed. &lt;ref name=bbc2&gt;{{cite news |title= Nigerian ex-speaker Dimeji Bankole cleared of fraud |url= https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-africa-16821097|work= |publisher=[[BBC News]] |date=31 January 2012 |accessdate=29 February 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Financial Accounting Standards Board''' ('''FASB''') is a private, [[non-profit organization]] standard-setting body&lt;ref name="NYT_2016_apr_26"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://nyti.ms/1NO8Ibh | title=The Quiet War on Corporate Accountability | publisher=The New York Times | date=26 April 2016 | accessdate=26 April 2016 | author1=Ramanna, Karthik | author2=Dreschel, Allen}}&lt;/ref&gt; whose primary purpose is to establish and improve [[Generally Accepted Accounting Principles]] (GAAP) within the [[United States]] in the public's interest. The [[Securities and Exchange Commission]] (SEC) designated the FASB as the organization responsible for setting accounting standards for public companies in the US. The FASB replaced the [[American Institute of Certified Public Accountants]]' (AICPA) [[Accounting Principles Board]] (APB) on July 1, 1973.

FASB accounting standards are accepted as authoritative by many organizations, including state Boards of Accountancy and the American Institute of CPAs (AICPA).&lt;ref name="About FASB"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://fasb.org/jsp/FASB/Page/SectionPage&amp;cid=1176154526495|title=About the FASB|website=fasb.org|access-date=2017-10-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="IASplus"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.iasplus.com/en-us/resources/faf/fasb|title=Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB)|website=www.iasplus.com|language=en-us|access-date=2017-10-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The FASB's mission is to “establish and improve financial accounting and reporting standards to provide useful information to investors and other users of financial reports and educate stakeholders on how to most effectively understand and implement those standards.”&lt;ref name="About FASB" /&gt;&lt;ref name="IASplus" /&gt; The FASB carries out its mission through improving the usefulness of financial reporting, focusing on the faithful representation and relevance of financial information, including the enhancing characteristics of useful information, comparability, timeliness, understandability, and verifiability. The FASB also accomplishes their mission through educating and guiding auditors, preparers, and other users of financial statements, ensuring current standards reflect developments in methods of doing business and economic environment changes, and by acknowledging areas of insufficiency in financial reporting that could be improved through the standard setting process.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.investopedia.com/terms/f/fasb.asp|title=Financial Accounting Standards Board – FASB|last=Staff|first=Investopedia|date=2003-11-20|work=Investopedia|access-date=2017-10-06|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.fasb.org/cs/ContentServer?c=Document_C&amp;pagename=FASB/Document_C/DocumentPage&amp;cid=1176162391050|title=Rules of Procedure – December 11, 2013|website=www.fasb.org|access-date=2017-10-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The board is supported by more than 60 staff&lt;ref name="Membership" /&gt; with backgrounds in public accounting, industry, academia, and government.&lt;ref name="FASB Facts" /&gt;

=== Oversight ===
The FASB is subject to oversight by the [[Financial Accounting Foundation]] (FAF), which selects the members of the FASB and the [[Governmental Accounting Standards Board]] and funds both organizations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Overview |url=http://www.fasb.org/faf/faf_info.shtml |website=www.fasb.org |accessdate=16 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Board of Trustees of the FAF is selected by a nomination process that involves several organizations from investing, accounting, business, financial, and governmental sectors, but are ultimately selected by the existing Board. The selection process was amended as such in 2008 to reduce private sector influence on the Board of Trustees and its oversight of the FASB and GASB.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=FASB trustees approve major structural changes |url=https://www.iasplus.com/en/news/2008/February/news3974?id=en:rss:direct |website=www.iasplus.com |accessdate=16 July 2018 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Polley"&gt;{{cite web |last1=Polley |first1=Terry |title=From the President's Desk -  Independence Day Special Issue |url=https://accountingfoundation.org/jsp/Foundation/Page/FAFSectionPage&amp;cid=1176160620987 |website=accountingfoundation.org |accessdate=16 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Funding ===
The FASB obtains funding from accounting support fees, subscription and publication revenues, and investment income.&lt;ref name="AF"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.accountingfoundation.org/jsp/Foundation/Page/FAFSectionPage&amp;cid=1351027545591|title=How We're Funded|website=www.accountingfoundation.org|access-date=2017-10-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

FASB Accounting Support Fees are collected under the authority of the [[Sarbanes–Oxley Act|Sarbanes-Oxley Act]]. Fees are assessed and collected from issuers of publicly-traded securities and allocated based on the average market capitalization of each issuer. The FASB accounting support fees are reviewed by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) each year to ensure compliance with the statute.&lt;ref name="AF" /&gt;

Subscription and Publication revenue includes sales and licensing of copyrighted FASB-related materials. The [[Financial Accounting Foundation]] (FAF) licenses the content of the FASB Codification to commercial publishers and other licensees for inclusion in their proprietary online research systems. The FASB Codification materials also are available through various paid subscription plans and hard copy printed versions.&lt;ref name="IASplus" /&gt;&lt;ref name="AF" /&gt;

== History ==
=== Inception ===
Marshall Armstrong, then-president of the [[American Institute of Certified Public Accountants]] (AICPA), appointed a group of seven men ([[the Wheat Committee]]) in the early 1970s to examine the organization and operation of the [[Accounting Principles Board]], in order to determine what adjustments were needed to facilitate more accurate and timely results.&lt;ref name="Zeff" /&gt; Their findings, “Report of the Study on the Establishment of Accounting Principles”, were published in March 1972, and proposed several changes including establishing the Financial Accounting Foundation, separate from other professional firms, that would be overseen by the Board of Trustees. The FASB was conceived as a full-time body to ensure that Board member deliberations encourage broad participation, objectively consider all stakeholder views, and are not influenced or directed by political/private interests.&lt;ref name="Zeff"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Zeff|first=Stephen A.|title=The Wheat Study on Establishment of Accounting Principles (1971–72): A historical study|url=http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0278425414001033|journal=Journal of Accounting and Public Policy|volume=34|issue=2|pages=146–174|doi=10.1016/j.jaccpubpol.2014.12.004}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Wheat Report also recommended developing the “Financial Accounting Standards Advisory Council, a 20-member advisory council that members serve an initial 1-year term, that could be renewed indefinitely, and to explicitly define the FASB research projects, to ensure timely and appropriate results.&lt;ref name="Zeff" /&gt;

The U.S Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) issued Accounting Series Release No. 150 (ASR 150), which states that FASB pronouncements will be considered by the SEC as having “substantial authoritative support”, in 1973.&lt;ref name="FASB timeline"&gt;{{cite web|title=Timeline|url=http://www.fasb.org/jsp/FASB/Page/TimelinePage&amp;cid=1175805309640|website=www.fasb.org|accessdate=1 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; That same year, the FASB issued its first standard, Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 1: Disclosure of Foreign Currency Translation Information.&lt;ref name="Standard 1"&gt;{{cite web|title=Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 1|url=http://www.fasb.org/timeline/timeline-assets/assets/downloads/1973_statement-of-financial-accounting-standards-no-1_fin.pdf#view=Fit|accessdate=1 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Conceptual Framework ===
The FASB Conceptual Framework was established in 1973 as a comprehensible set of standards and rules intended to address and solve new emerging issues. The conceptual framework underlied financial accounting by serving as the Board’s reasoning behind its standards-setting decisions.&lt;ref name="Storey"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Storey|first1=Reed K.|last2=Storey|first2=Sylvia|title=The Framework of Financial Accounting Concepts and Standards|date=1998|publisher=Financial Accounting Standards Board|location=Norwalk, CT|url=https://books.google.com/books/about/The_Framework_of_Financial_Accounting_Co.html?id=ELJpQgAACAAJ}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Freedman"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Freedman|first1=John|title=What Is the Conceptual Framework Developed by the Financial Accounting Standards Board?|url=http://smallbusiness.chron.com/conceptual-framework-developed-financial-accounting-standards-board-67249.html|accessdate=16 November 2017|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The conceptual framework provides two functions: to state the objectives of financial reporting and provide definitions of financial statement elements. The conceptual framework creates a foundation for financial accounting and establishes consistent standards that highlights the nature, function, and limitations of financial reporting.&lt;ref name="Storey"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Freedman"/&gt;

=== Emerging Issues Task Force ===
The FASB formed the Emerging Issues Task Force (EITF) in 1984.&lt;ref name="FASB Facts" /&gt; This group was formed in order to provide timely responses to financial issues as they emerged. This group includes 15 people from both the private and public sectors coupled with representatives from the FASB and an SEC observer.&lt;ref name="Spiceland" /&gt; As issues emerge, the task force considers them and tries to reach a consensus on what course of action to take. From conception until the 2003 AICPA GAAP Agreement, if consensus was reached on an topic, the group would issue an EITF Issue that was considered equivalent to a FASB pronouncement and included in GAAP.&lt;ref name="Spiceland" /&gt;

=== International Standard Setting Comparability ===
The FASB participated in an international conference on global accounting standards in 1991, “The Objectives and Concepts Underlying Financial Reporting,” co-sponsored by the International Accounting Standards Committee and the Fédération des Experts Comptables Européens.&lt;ref name="Cairns"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Cairns|first1=David|title=The Conceptual Framework - The International Experience|journal=SSRN Electronic Journal|date=2001|doi=10.2139/ssrn.2379002}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Two years later, the FASB participated in the formation of the G4+1, a group of international standard setters, whose members included the United States, Australia, the United Kingdom, Canada and New Zealand.&lt;ref name="Cairns" /&gt; In August 1994 the group released a special report, titled “Future Events: A Conceptual Study of their Significance for Recognition and Measurement”.&lt;ref name="Johnson"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Johnson|first1=L. Todd|title=Future Events: A Conceptual Study of Their Significance for Recognition and Measurement|url=http://www.fasb.org/timeline/timeline-assets/assets/downloads/1991_fasb-special-report_fin.pdf#view=Fit|accessdate=1 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1999, the FASB issued a report on “International Accounting Standard Setting: A Vision for the Future”, which acknowledged the rapid changes taking place in the international accounting standard setting environment, and that Convergence and development of high-quality international standards are coinciding goals.&lt;ref name="IASS"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Financial Accounting Standards Board|title=International Accounting Standard Setting: A Vision for the Future|date=1999|publisher=FASB|location=Norwalk}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) published a "proposed Roadmap” for the adoption of International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) for U.S. companies, to replace U.S. GAAP (Generally Accepted Accounting Principles) on a timetable that established several milestones to be achieved by 2011 as the basis for moving ahead toward a transition to IFRS beginning in 2014."&lt;ref name="FASB_IASB_2015"&gt;{{citation |url=http://www.lexology.com/library/detail.aspx?g=4a9271bc-0675-493f-ad99-5fc859227939 |date=May 18, 2015 |title=Will SEC finally nix IFRS in the United States? |authors=Calfee Halter &amp; Griswold LLP |accessdate=April 26, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== The Norwalk Agreement ===
{{main article|Norwalk Agreement}}
In 2002, the FASB commenced work on a convergence project in partnership  with the International Accounting Standards Board (IASB), the independent, accounting standard-setting body of the International Financial Reporting Standards Foundation.&lt;ref&gt;IFRS Foundation, 2012. [http://www.ifrs.org/The+organisation/IASCF+and+IASB.htm About the IFRS Foundation and the IASB]. Retrieved on April 28, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; The two groups met on September 18, 2002, in Norwalk, Connecticut, to sign a [[Memorandum of Understanding]] (MoU)&lt;ref name="IASB"&gt;{{citation |publisher=Financial Accounting Standards Board and International Accounting Standards Board |date=2002 |url=http://www.fasb.org/news/memorandum.pdf |title=Memorandum of Understanding, The Norwalk Agreement |accessdate=March 17, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; which "committed the boards to developing high-quality, compatible accounting standards with a common solution."&lt;ref name="FASB_IASB_2015"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Financial Accounting Standards Board and International Accounting Standards Board (2002). [http://www.fasb.org/news/memorandum.pdf ''Memorandum of Understanding, "The Norwalk Agreement".''].  Retrieved March 17, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

This MoU, which came to be known as the “Norwalk Agreement,” outlined plans to converge IFRS and US GAAP into one set of high quality and compatible standards. For ten years the FASB and IASB collaborated on a "common objective not only to eliminate differences between IFRS and U.S. GAAP wherever possible, “but also to achieve convergence in accounting standards that stood the test of time."&lt;ref name="FASB_IASB_2015"/&gt;

=== Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 ===
The [[Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002]] was signed into law on July 30, 2002, to protect stakeholders and investors by improving the dependability and precision of corporate financial disclosures. The legislation also created the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (PCAOB), and included accounting support fees from issuers of securities to FASB.&lt;ref name="SOX"&gt;{{cite web|title=Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002'|url=https://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/PLAW-107publ204/html/PLAW-107publ204.htm|accessdate=24 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== AICPA’s GAAP Agreement ===
In November 2002, FASB Chairman Robert Herz announced that FASB and AICPA came to the agreement that the AICPA would no longer issue Statements of Positions (SOPs) that are considered authoritative GAAP.&lt;ref name="Bryan-Low"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Bryan-Low|first1=Cassell|title=FASB Takes Back Powers In Accounting Rule Making|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB1036450538489975348|accessdate=24 April 2018|work=WSJ|date=5 November 2002}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Bragg"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Epstein|first1=Barry J.|last2=Nach|first2=Ralph|last3=Bragg|first3=Steven M.|title=Wiley GAAP codification enhanced|date=2009|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons|location=Hoboken, NJ|isbn=0470498285|page=16}}&lt;/ref&gt; They also concluded that consensus of the EITF will be required to be ratified by the FASB to become authoritative GAAP.&lt;ref name="Bragg"/&gt;

=== Investor Task Force ===
The FASB established the Investor Task Force (ITF) in 2005, which was an advisory resource that provided the Board with sector expertise and specific insights from the professional investment community on relevant accounting issues.&lt;ref name="Gullapalli"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Gullapalli|first1=Diya|title=FASB to Create Investor Task Force|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB112796072436155479|accessdate=24 April 2018|work=Wall Street Journal|date=29 September 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; The FASB then implemented [[SFAS 157]] which established new standards for disclosure regarding [[fair value]] measurements in financial statements in 2006.&lt;ref name=FAS157&gt;http://www.fasb.org/summary/stsum157.shtml, “Summary of Statement No. 157” – FASB Pre-Codification Standards&lt;/ref&gt; That same year, the FASB added Investor Liaisons to its staff, who would be responsible for reaching out to investors to hear feedback on the various FASB activities.&lt;ref name="Chandy Smith"&gt;{{cite web|title=Chandy C. Smith Bio|url=http://www.fasb.org/cs/ContentServer?c=Page&amp;cid=1176156484986&amp;d=&amp;pagename=FASB%2FPage%2FSectionPage|website=FASB|accessdate=25 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Financial Crisis Advisory Group (FCAG) ===
The FASB and the [[International Accounting Standards Board]] created the Financial Crisis Advisory Group in 2008—an international group of standard-setting bodies—that coordinated responses "on the future of global standards in light of" the [[Financial_crisis_of_2007–2008|financial crisis of 2007–2010]].&lt;ref name="FCAG_2009_Haddrill"&gt;{{citation |url=http://www.accountancyage.com/aa/news/1778629/dont-mix-politics-standards-haddrill|title=Don't mix politics and standards, says Haddrill] |work=[[Accountancy Age]] |date=February 26, 2009 |accessdate=April 26, 2016 |first=Kevin |last=Reed}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The FCAG was composed of 15–20 senior leaders in finance and chaired by Harvey Goldschmid and Hans Hoogervorst with a mandate to investigate financial reporting issues uncovered by the [[global financial crisis]]. FCAG members included [[Stephen Haddrill]] and [[Michel Prada]]—a member of the [[International Centre for Financial Regulation]] (ICFR) and co-chair of the Council on Global Financial Regulation was a member of the Financial Crisis Advisory Group.&lt;ref name=GPPS&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.globalpublicpolicysymposium.com/bios/prada_michel.htm |title=Michel Prada Chairman, Autorité des Marchés Financiers (France) |work=Global Public Policy Symposium |accessdate=2011-06-07 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081121202355/http://www.globalpublicpolicysymposium.com/bios/prada_michel.htm |archivedate=2008-11-21 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=ICSA&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.icsa2010agm.com/michel-prada-19-66.aspx |title=Michel Prada |publisher=International Council of Securities Associations |accessdate=2011-06-07 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110714043711/http://www.icsa2010agm.com/michel-prada-19-66.aspx |archivedate=2011-07-14 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Haddrill who was the only UK representative on the FCAG, is CEO of the [[Financial Reporting Council]] (FRC) in the [[United Kingdom]] and has a close interest in [[accounting standards]].&lt;ref name="FCAG_2009_Haddrill"/&gt;

The FCAG issued a report in July 2009 finding, among other things, that the FASB and SEC had been pressured by politicians and banks to change accounting standards to protect banks from the impact of their toxic mortgages.&lt;ref name="McGinty_2009"&gt;{{citation |last=McGinty |first= T |title=Panel Assails Meddling Into FASB Rules Making |work=Wall Street Journal via EBSCO|date=July 29, 2009 |accessdate=26 April 2016}}"The article focuses on a report issued by the Financial Crisis Advisory Group which encourages U.S. Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) to refrain from the intervention by some politicians and interest groups that led such agency to ease regulations for determining the value of troubled bank assets in 2009. It says that the objection of the report to political pressure could support the board as it seeks a new proposal to mandate firms to show all financial instruments on their balance sheets. It states how the advisory group was established."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="toxic_USA_today_2009"&gt;{{citation |last=Pallavi |first=Gogoi |title=Accounting rule that put banks in a bind dumped |work=USA Today via EBSCO |date=April 3, 2009 |accessdate=April 26, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="FCAG_2009_Haddrill"/&gt; Just prior to the report to the [[G20]], and in reference to the political pressure placed on standards setters "to make changes to fair value accounting rules over suggestions that it exacerbated the financial crisis" Haddrill cautioned, "Who do we want to set accounting standards? Not politicians, that’s clear. But neither do we want experts vacuum-packed in a world of their own."&lt;ref name="FCAG_2009_Haddrill"/&gt;

=== Accounting Standards Codification ===
{{main article|Accounting Standards Codification}}
On July 1, 2009, the FASB announced the launch of its Accounting Standards Codification,&lt;ref name="Codification"&gt;{{cite web|title=FASB Accounting Standards Codification®|url=https://asc.fasb.org/|website=asc.fasb.org|accessdate=1 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="FASB resources"&gt;{{cite web|title=Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB)|url=https://www.iasplus.com/en/resources/regional/fasb|website=www.iasplus.com|accessdate=1 November 2017|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Practical"&gt;{{cite web|title=FASB To Launch Accounting Standards Codification on July 1, 2009|url=https://content.next.westlaw.com/Document/Ibb0a63c8ef0511e28578f7ccc38dcbee/View/FullText.html?contextData=(sc.Default)&amp;transitionType=Default&amp;firstPage=true&amp;bhcp=1|website=content.next.westlaw.com|accessdate=1 November 2017|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; an online research system representing the single source of authoritative nongovernmental U.S. GAAP, available from the FASB in multiple views; Professional view, Academic view, and Basic view. The Codification organizes the pronouncements that constitute U.S. GAAP into a consistent, searchable format.&lt;ref name="accounting_standards_2009"&gt;Financial Accounting Standards Board (2009). ''[http://www.fasb.org/cs/ContentServer?c=FASBContent_C&amp;pagename=FASB%2FFASBContent_C%2FNewsPage&amp;cid=1176156318458 News Release 07/1/09.]'' Retrieved September 8, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; The Codification is not to be confused with the FASB's 1973 Conceptual Framework project.&lt;ref name="FASB resources" /&gt;

=== Convergence to International Comparability ===
In 2010, the SEC instructed the staff to create and implement a work plan that addresses whether, when and how US GAAP should be merged into a global reporting model developed by International Accounting Standards Board (IASB)—the standards setting body designated by the International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS). The SEC staff research included including convergence with IFRS and an alternate IFRS endorsement mechanism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Commission Statement in Support of Convergence and Global Accounting Standards|url=https://www.sec.gov/rules/other/2010/33-9109.pdf|publisher=SEC|accessdate=26 April 2018|page=16, 25|date=4 February 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the resulting 2012 report the SEC Staff asserted that the IFRS standards were not sufficiently supported by U.S. capital market participants and lacked consistent implementation methods. The report goes on to say that, while the U.S. financial reporting community does not support IFRS as the authoritative mechanism for US financial reporting, there is support for “high-quality, globally accepted accounting standards” as demonstrated in the joint efforts of the IASB and FASB to develop converged financial reporting for revenue recognition and lease accounting.&lt;ref name="Work Plan"&gt;{{cite web|title=Work Plan for the Consideration of Incorporating International Financial Reporting Standards into the Financial Reporting System for U.S. Issuers|url=https://www.sec.gov/spotlight/globalaccountingstandards/ifrs-work-plan-final-report.pdf|accessdate=1 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The FASB and the IASB issued guidance on recognizing revenue in contracts with customers in 2014, establishing principles to report useful information to users of financial statements about the nature, timing, and uncertainty of revenue from these transactions.&lt;ref name="Cohn RR"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Cohn|first1=Michael|title=FASB and IASB Issue Revenue Recognition Standard|url=https://www.accountingtoday.com/news/fasb-and-iasb-issue-revenue-recognition-standard|accessdate=26 April 2018|work=Accounting Today|date=28 May 2014|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; In May 2015 the SEC acknowledged that "investors, auditors, regulators and standard-setters" in the United States did not support mandating International Financial Reporting Standards Foundation (IFRS) for all U.S. public companies. There was "little support for the SEC to provide an option allowing U.S. companies to prepare their financial statements under IFRS." However, there was support for a single set of globally accepted accounting standards.&lt;ref name="FASB_IASB_2015"/&gt; The FASB and IASB planned meetings in 2015 to discuss "business combinations, the disclosure framework, insurance contracts and the conceptual framework."&lt;ref name="FASB_IASB_2015_Lugo"&gt;{{citation |date=Jun 15, 2015 |first=Denise |last=Lugo |title=FASB-IASB make full circle return to the norwalk agreement |accessdate=April 26, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; As of 2017, there were no active bilateral FASB/IASB projects underway. Instead, the FASB participates in the Accounting Standards Advisory Forum, a global grouping of standard-setters, and monitors individual projects to seek comparability.&lt;ref name="Cohn ASAF"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Cohn|first1=Michael|title=New FASB Chairman Makes Plans for Future Accounting Standards|url=https://www.accountingtoday.com/news/new-fasb-chairman-makes-plans-for-future-accounting-standards|accessdate=26 April 2018|work=Accounting Today|date=29 July 2013|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Accounting Standards ==
=== FASB Pronouncements ===
{{main article|List of FASB Pronouncements}}
The FASB pronouncements are a set of rules and general guidelines that help to facilitate the reporting of financial information. The pronouncements are part of the accounting framework known as generally accepted accounting principles.&lt;ref name="Pronouncements"&gt;{{cite web|title=FASB Pronouncements|url=https://www.accountingtools.com/articles/2017/5/10/fasb-pronouncements|website=AccountingTools|accessdate=1 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In order to establish accounting principles, the FASB issues pronouncements publicly, each addressing general or specific accounting issues. These pronouncements are Statements of Financial Accounting Standards, Statements of Financial Accounting Concepts, [[List_of_FASB_Interpretations|FASB Interpretations]], FASB Technical Bulletins, EITF Abstracts. Since September 15, 2009, authoritative announcements are contained in the codification itself.&lt;ref name="About ASC"&gt;{{cite web|title=About the Codification|url=https://asc.fasb.org/imageRoot/71/58741171.pdf|accessdate=26 April 2018|page=29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Major FASB Standards ===
==== Revenue Recognition ====
On May 28, 2014, the FASB and International Accounting Standards Board (IASB) jointly issued substantially converged standards on the recognition of revenue from contracts with customers. The standards improve the financial reporting of revenue and improve comparability of the top line in financial statements globally. The two boards developed new, substantially converged requirements for the recognition of revenue in both IFRS and U.S. GAAP – providing substantial enhancements to the quality and consistency of how revenue is reported while also improving comparability in the financial statements of companies reporting using IFRS and U.S. GAAP. The previous revenue recognitions requirements of both IFRS and U.S. GAAP differed from one and often resulted in different accounting for transactions that were economically similar. Furthermore, while revenue recognition requirements of IFRS lacked sufficient detail, the accounting requirements of U.S. GAAP were considered to be overly prescriptive and conflicting in certain areas.&lt;ref name="Bramwell"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Bramwell|first1=Jason|title=FASB, IASB Unveil Final Standard on Revenue Recognition|url=https://www.accountingweb.com/aa/standards/fasb-iasb-unveil-final-standard-on-revenue-recognition|website=AccountingWEB|accessdate=1 November 2017|language=en-gb|date=28 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Credit Losses ====
On June 16, 2016 the FASB issued an ASU that improves financial reporting by requiring timelier recording of credit losses on loans and other financial instruments held by financial institutions and other organizations. The ASU also amends the accounting for credit losses on available-for-sale debt securities and purchased financial assets with credit deterioration, and requires enhanced disclosures to help investors and other financial statement users better understand significant estimates and judgments used in estimating credit losses, as well as the credit quality and underwriting standards of an organization’s portfolio.&lt;ref name="CLR"&gt;{{cite web|title=What is Credit Loss Ratio? definition and meaning|url=http://www.investorwords.com/12005/credit_loss_ratio.html|website=InvestorWords.com|accessdate=1 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Variable Interest Entities ====
The FASB Issued statement number 167, a revision to FASB interpretation no. 46(R) Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities, in June 2009. This update provides new guidance on how to determine whether an organization that is either inadequately capitalized or not controlled through voting rights should be consolidated.

Under the new standard, the decision whether to consolidate is determined by two factors: a company’s design and intention and a parent company’s ability to direct that organization’s actions in a way that significantly impacts its economic performance.&lt;ref name="JoA"&gt;{{cite web|title=FASB Issues Standards on Securitizations, SPEs|url=http://www.journalofaccountancy.com/news/2009/jun/20091801.html|website=Journal of Accountancy|accessdate=1 November 2017|date=12 June 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Pensions ====
In late 2006, the FASB issued ''Employers’ Accounting for Defined Benefit Pension and Other Postretirement Plans'' (statement 158). Under this update, if a pension or other postretirement plan is overfunded, a company must recognize that overfunded amount as an asset, which can be reduced later if the plan becomes underfunded. Conversely, if a plan is underfunded, a company must recognize that underfunded amount as a liability, which can be reduced if a plan’s funding increases in a period.  These asset or liability determinations are recognized at the employer’s year end in the same year that the plan funding takes place.&lt;ref name="Pensions"&gt;{{cite web|title=FASB Improves Employer Pension &amp; Postretirement Plan Accounting|url=https://www.accountingweb.com/practice/practice-excellence/fasb-improves-employer-pension-postretirement-plan-accounting|website=AccountingWEB|accessdate=1 November 2017|language=en-gb|date=4 October 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

These enhancements were made in order to provide employees, investors, retirees, and users of financial statements more complete information about the status of a pension or other postretirement plan, which is used to make informed decisions about organizations capabilities to fulfill plan obligations.&lt;ref name="Pensions" /&gt;

==== Stock Options ====
The FASB issued a statement on ''Share Based Payments'' (statement 123(R)) in 2004, developed jointly with the IASB.&lt;ref name="123(R)"&gt;{{cite web|title=FAS 123 (Revised 2004) (as issued)|url=http://www.fasb.org/jsp/FASB/Document_C/DocumentPage?cid=1218220124271&amp;acceptedDisclaimer=true|website=www.fasb.org|accessdate=26 April 2018|page=iii}}&lt;/ref&gt; This standard update requires companies to identify the cost of share-based payments (e.g., restricted share plans, employee share purchase plans, performance-based awards, share appreciation rights, and stock options) within their financials.&lt;ref name="123(R)"/&gt; The FASB updated this reporting standard with the goal of improving comparability, relevance and reliability of financial information.&lt;ref name="Expense options"&gt;{{cite web|title=FASB: Companies Must Expense Options|url=https://www.accountingweb.com/practice/practice-excellence/fasb-companies-must-expense-options|website=AccountingWEB|accessdate=1 November 2017|language=en-gb|date=17 December 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Leases (balance sheet) ====
In February 2016, the FASB issued a new Leases standard, to improve financial reporting about leasing transactions. The new standard requires organizations to include lease obligations on their balance sheets, and affects all companies and other organizations that lease assets.&lt;ref name="lease"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Bramwell|first1=Jason|title=The Wait is Over: FASB Issues New Guidance on Lease Accounting|url=https://www.accountingweb.com/aa/standards/the-wait-is-over-fasb-issues-new-guidance-on-lease-accounting|website=AccountingWEB|accessdate=1 November 2017|language=en|date=25 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This project was first commenced by the FASB and the IASB in 2006, and the IASB issued IFRS 16, Leases, on January 13, 2016. The FASB issued an ASU to improve the accounting for lease transactions on February 25, 2016. The improvements in this ASU requires organizations engaged in leasing arrangements to recognize assets and liabilities for leases with terms of 12 months or longer. Organizations are also required to recognize both operating leases and capital leases on their balance sheets, and disclose information pertaining to the lease amount, time, and uncertainties of cash flows.&lt;ref name="lease" /&gt;

==== Derivative Accounting ====
Statement No. 133 was issued by the FASB in June 1998, which inaugurated accounting and reporting standards for derivative instruments, including instruments rooted in other contracts, and hedging activities. Organizations are also required to identify all derivatives as assets or liabilities, which are stated at fair value. Derivatives can be classified as a hedge of the exposure to changes in the fair value of a recognized asset or liability or an unrecognized firm commitment, a hedge of the exposure to variable cash flows of a projected transaction, or a hedge of the foreign currency exposure of a net investment in a foreign operation, an unrecognized firm obligation, an available-for-sale security, or a foreign-currency-denominated predicted transaction. Upon electing to use hedge accounting, companies must establish a method to evaluate the effectiveness of hedging a derivative, and a method to determine the ineffectiveness of a hedge.&lt;ref name="riskex"&gt;{{cite web|title=FAS 133 Summary – Advisors on Derivatives &amp; Hedge Accounting for the Energy Sector ~ Disclosure Compliance FAS 133 Consultants.

== Criticism ==
=== Mark-to-Market ===
Critics argue that the 2006 SFAS 157 contributed to the [[Fair_value_accounting_and_the_subprime_mortgage_crisis|2008 financial crisis]] by easing the mark-to-market accounting rule and allowing valuation of assets based on their current market price, rather than the purchase price.  Critics claim FASB changes to [[mark-to-market]] accounting were made to accommodate "banks with toxic assets on their books."&lt;ref name="Taub"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Taub|first1=Stephen|title=FAS 157 Could Cause Huge Write-offs|url=http://ww2.cfo.com/accounting-tax/2007/11/fas-157-could-cause-huge-write-offs/|website=CFO|accessdate=16 November 2017|date=7 November 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;
  
However, others from within the accounting profession assert that the mark-to-market system in fact provides greater transparency and stability by applying similar values to similar assets, regardless of whether they were bought or created internally by a firm.&lt;ref name="Newman"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Newman|first1=Jeremy|title=In Defense Of Mark-To-Market|url=https://www.forbes.com/2009/08/18/mark-to-market-banks-economy-opinions-contributors-accounting.html#1e64ec2c2414|website=Forbes|accessdate=16 November 2017|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; They contrast this with the alternate “[[mark-to-model]]” system—said to be riskier, less transparent, and results in incomparable and inconsistent reporting.&lt;ref name="Newman" /&gt;

Others say mark-to-market provides the most practical choice when valuing most assets, if there is understanding of the long-term effects, and obligation to a global position.&lt;ref name="Newman"/&gt; They counter that the banking issues went beyond failures in accounting and into major liquidity concerns, and that the accounting profession, FASB, and SEC were not responsible for the banking crisis.&lt;ref name="Newman"/&gt;

A report from the [[Harvard Business Review]] agreed that the mark-to-market accounting is not the direct cause of the financial crisis, but the lack of knowledge related to accounting standards by investors fueled the fire. Most investors at the time assumed that all of banks’ assets were appraised at market prices, and that the writing down of bonds would cause banks to violate regulatory capital requirements.&lt;ref name="Pozen"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Pozen|first1=Robert C.|title=Is It Fair to Blame Fair Value Accounting for the Financial Crisis?|url=https://hbr.org/2009/11/is-it-fair-to-blame-fair-value-accounting-for-the-financial-crisis|website=Harvard Business Review|accessdate=16 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Materiality ===
The FASB issued a proposal regarding "the use of materiality by reporting entities" in an amendment of the definition of the legal concept of [[Materiality (auditing)|materiality]] in 2015, stating that “information would be considered material if it was likely to be seen by a reasonable person as significantly altering the total mix of facts about a company.” This amendment raised concerns by auditors who believed leaving materiality as a legal concept would undermine judgments made by preparers and auditors to an attorney.&lt;ref name="Morgenson"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Morgenson|first1=Gretchen|title=FASB Proposes to Curb What Companies Must Disclose|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2016/01/03/business/fasb-proposes-to-curb-what-companies-must-disclose.html|accessdate=26 April 2018|work=The New York Times|date=2 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, FASB’s inclusion of materiality was designed to facilitate more transparency by instructing greater disclosure by preparers.  According to FASB Concepts Statement 8:&lt;ref name="Concept 8"&gt;{{cite web|title=Concepts Statement No. 8—Conceptual Framework for Financial Reporting—Chapter 1, The Objective of General Purpose Financial Reporting, and Chapter 3, Qualitative Characteristics of Useful Financial Information (a replacement of FASB Concepts Statements No. 1 and No. 2)|url=http://www.fasb.org/jsp/FASB/Document_C/DocumentPage?cid=1176157498129&amp;acceptedDisclaimer=true|website=www.fasb.org|accessdate=16 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; information is material if omitting or misstating it could influence decisions users make on the basis of the financial information of a specific reporting entity. This guidance is followed by the explanation: “In other words, materiality is an entity-specific aspect of relevance based on the nature or magnitude or both of the items to which the information relates in the context of an individual entity’s financial report.”&lt;ref name="Afterman"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Afterman|first1=Allan B.|title=FASB's Proposal to Change the Definition of Materiality: The Unexpected Uproar – The CPA Journal|url=https://www.cpajournal.com/2016/03/13/fasbs-proposal-change-definition-materiality-unexpected-uproar/|website=The CPA Journal|accessdate=16 November 2017|date=13 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== International Comparability vs. Convergence ===
Some industry professionals support development of a single, globally-shared set of accounting standards. [[Convergence_of_accounting_standards|Convergence]] proponents assert that a single set of standards would make it easier and more cost-effective for large multi-national corporations to report using one set of financial reporting standards for all countries. They believe it would make financial statements more comparable to one another, improving overall transparency and understanding of a company’s financial health.  Supporters also argue that a single set of standards would give investors access to crucial information more quickly and increase opportunities for international investments, resulting in economic growth.&lt;ref name="Bader"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Bader|first1=Keith|title=The International Accounting Debate: Options in Standardization|journal=Journal of International Business and Law|date=2009|volume=8|issue=1|url=https://scholarlycommons.law.hofstra.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?referer=&amp;httpsredir=1&amp;article=1105&amp;context=jibl|accessdate=15 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Pologeorgis"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Pologeorgis|first1=Nicolas|title=The Impact Of Combining The U.S. GAAP And IFRS|url=https://www.investopedia.com/articles/economics/12/impact-gaap-ifrs-convergence.asp|website=Investopedia|accessdate=15 December 2017|date=16 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other professionals, however, are opposed to wholesale convergence of a single set of international accounting standards.&lt;ref name="Bader"/&gt; Opponents share concerns that, due to different environmental influences around the world, such as differing stages of economic development and sources of funding, independent accounting standards are appropriate and necessary.&lt;ref name="Choi"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Choi|first1=Frederick D.|title=Management Accounting|date=1981|page=29|chapter=A Cluster Approach to Harmonization}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Convergence opponents have said that without vision and commitment to convergence, the standards wouldn’t be effective unless they were enforced or provide significant benefits.&lt;ref name="Bader"/&gt;

Many U.S. accounting firms are opposed to convergence because of the familiarity of GAAP, the unfamiliarity with international accounting principles, and other countries' accounting systems. U.S. firms and other CPAs have been reluctant to adapt and learn a new accounting system, and believe that IFRS lacks guidance compared to the GAAP. CFOs are also against converging to one set of standards, because of the associated cost.&lt;ref name="Pologeorgis"/&gt;

'''Firas Mustafa Tlass''' (born 20 August 1960) is a Syrian business tycoon and a member of a significant Sunni family who had close relations with former Syrian President [[Hafez al-Assad]], but defected to the [[Syrian opposition|rebels]] during the [[Syrian Civil War]].

Firas Tlass founded Min Ajl Suriyya (MAS) (“For Syria” in English) in 1984.

===Controversy===
At the beginning of the 2000s, [[Israel]] and the US accused Syria that it enabled Arab mujahideen to percolate weapons through its borders into [[Iraq]], mainly through influential Firas Tlass.&lt;ref name=asiatimes&gt;{{cite news|last=Athanasiadis|first=Iason|title=Syria: Odd man out in a tough neighbourhood|url=http://www.atimes.com/atimes/Middle_East/EJ09Ak05.html|accessdate=6 July 2012|newspaper=Asia Times|date=9 October 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2003, it was also claimed that Iraq officials sent their banned weapons to Syria via Tlass, who had trade connections with Iraq.&lt;ref name=aps29mar&gt;{{cite news|title=Damascus Rejects 'Unfounded' Arms Claims|url=http://www.thefreelibrary.com/SYRIA+-+March+28+-+Damascus+Rejects+'Unfounded'+Arms+Claims.-a099874218|accessdate=26 March 2013|work=APS Diplomat Recorder|date=29 March 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt; Firas was also accused of corruption and of benefiting from the Assad government.&lt;ref name=bbc6712&gt;{{cite news|title=Manaf Tlas: Syrian regime 'taking country to Hell'|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-middle-east-18737185|accessdate=6 July 2012|work=BBC|date=6 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Forbes]]'' argued in 2011 that he was among those who got a 5% commission on deals they brokered in Syria.&lt;ref name=forbes11/&gt;

In 2012-2014 [[LafargeHolcim]]'s factory in Jalabiya, northern Syria, continued to operate as the Syrian war raged around it. Factory chief Bruno Pescheux has admitted Lafarge paid up to $100,000 a month to Syrian tycoon Firas Tlass, a former minority shareholder who gave cash to armed factions in order to keep the factory open.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.france24.com/en/20171208-former-lafarge-ceo-charged-terror-financing-allegations&lt;/ref&gt;

==Defection and views==
It was reported by [[Agence France-Presse|AFP]] that Firas and his father, former defense minister Mustafa Tlass, arrived in Paris in March 2012. But their move was not seen as a defection.&lt;ref name=afb312&gt;{{cite news|title=Syrian former defence minister Tlass in France|url=https://www.google.com/hostednews/afp/article/ALeqM5g7sa3qN_SVIMtnJ4cY9u_ypkj-DQ?docId=CNG.3e2a6b317923f10174ad9bb42adbacc4.2c1|accessdate=6 July 2012|work=Agence France-Presse|date=12 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, there is another report on his defection.

'''Gary Wayne Hall, Sr.''' (born August 7, 1951) is an American former competition swimmer, three-time Olympic medalist, and former world record-holder in five events.

==Background==
Hall attended [[Indiana University]], where he swam for the [[Indiana Hoosiers]] swimming and diving team under coach [[James Counsilman|Doc Counsilman]].&lt;ref name="HallSr1"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.swimmingworldmagazine.com/lane9/news/6469.asp |title=- Swimming World News |work=Swimming World News |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120825214654/http://www.swimmingworldmagazine.com/lane9/news/6469.asp |archivedate=August 25, 2012 |df=mdy }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://grfx.cstv.com/photos/schools/ind/sports/m-swim/auto_pdf/08mediaguide-section2.pdf Indiana Hoosiers]. (PDF) . cstv.com.&lt;/ref&gt; As a college swimmer, he specialized in the [[individual medley]]. Hall was elected captain of the Hoosiers swimming team in his senior year.  In academics, Hall excelled in the classroom and was consistently cited by the [[NCAA]] as an outstanding example of student-athlete.  He was accepted for medical school at the [[University of Cincinnati]].  He later became an [[ophthalmologist]], and practiced in [[Phoenix, Arizona]].&lt;ref name="HallSr1"&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20110513062953/http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/vault/gallery/featured/GAL1141175/2/10/index.htm  Gary Hall Sr.]. sportsillustrated.cnn.com&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.sports-reference.com/olympics/athletes/ha/gary-hall-1.html |title=Gary Hall |work=Olympics at Sports-Reference.com |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100524053953/http://www.sports-reference.com/olympics/athletes/ha/gary-hall-1.html |archivedate=May 24, 2010 |df=mdy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hall first represented the United States in the [[1968 Summer Olympics]] held in Mexico City, Mexico, where he won a silver medal for his second-place finish in the [[Swimming at the 1968 Summer Olympics - Men's 400 metre individual medley|men's 400-meter individual medley]].  Two years later he broke the world record in the 200-meter butterfly.

Hall made it a point to vigorously exercise in the swimming pool after daily med school classes. His wife, the former Mary Keating, being from a swimming family, understood his love of the water.

At the [[1972 Summer Olympics]] in Munich, Germany, he earned a silver medal in the [[Swimming at the 1972 Summer Olympics - Men's 200 metre butterfly|men's 200-meter butterfly]].  His final Olympic appearance was at the [[1976 Summer Olympics]] in Montreal, Canada, capping his Olympic career with a bronze medal in the [[Swimming at the 1976 Summer Olympics - Men's 100 metre butterfly|men's 100-meter butterfly]].  At the end of the Montreal Olympics, his fellow American athletes from all sports disciplines, chose him to be the [[United States at the 1976 Summer Olympics|U.S. flagbearer]] in the closing ceremony.

==Ophthalmologist career==
Hall graduated from the [[University of Cincinnati]] College of Medicine, located in [[Cincinnati, Ohio]].  He practiced as Dr. Gary Hall, [[Doctor of Medicine|MD]] as an [[ophthalmologist]] in [[Phoenix, Arizona]] at the Gary Hall [[Lasik]] Center.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wellness.com/dir/2014382/ophthalmologist/az/phoenix/gary-hall-gary-hall-laser-ctr-md|title=Gary Hall, MD|author=Anonymous|work=wellness.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; Common conditions he treated in [[Ophthalmology]] included [[Macular degeneration]] and [[Cataracts]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://peopleknock.com/doctors/dr-gary-w-hall-md-phoenix-arizona|title=Dr. Gary W. Hall, MD – Phoenix, Arizona – Ophthalmology|work=peopleknock.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In 2005, following a series of medical errors and reprimands dating back to 1996, the Arizona Medical Board permanently banned Dr. Hall performing or assisting in any surgery. He was placed on a five-year probation, but allowed to keep his medical license. In 2009, he was stripped of his medical license when he was unable to pay a fine after he was found performing surgery.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bizjournals.com/phoenix/stories/2005/04/11/daily60.html|title=Doctors Behaving Badly: Ophthalmologist should have kept closer eye on patients|author=William Heisel|work=Center for Health Journalism}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==International Swimming Hall of Fame==
In 1981, Hall was inducted into the [[International Swimming Hall of Fame]] as an "Honor Swimmer."&lt;ref name=ishofprofile&gt;International Swimming Hall of Fame, Honorees, [http://www.ishof.org/dr.-gary-hall%2c-sr.--(usa).html  Gary Hall Sr.] Retrieved March 18, 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; Later on, he also became a local celebrity in Phoenix, as an ophthalmologist – appearing in his office's television ads and [[billboard (advertising)|billboard]] campaigns.

His son [[Gary Hall Jr.]] has become a famous Olympic swimmer as well, starting in the Atlanta 1996 Olympic Games, getting various gold medals at the 2000 Olympics in Sydney, Australia. With his son's participation at the 2004 Olympics in Athens, Greece, the Halls became the first father-and-son pair to make three Olympic appearances.

==Summer swimming camps==
Gary Hall Sr.  currently lives in Florida and operates [[The Race Club]] summer swimming camps.  The Race Club is a swimming club founded by Gary Hall Jr. and his father Gary Hall Sr.  The swimming club, originally known as "The World Team," was designed to serve as a swimming training group for elite swimmers across the world in preparation for the 2000 Sydney Olympic Games.

A '''general counsel''', '''chief counsel''', or '''chief legal officer''' ('''CLO''') is the chief [[lawyer]] of a legal department, usually in a company or a governmental department.

In a company, the person holding the position typically reports directly to the [[chief executive officer | CEO]], and their duties involve overseeing and identifying the legal issues in all departments and their interrelation, including engineering, design, marketing, sales, distribution, credit, finance, human resources and production, as well as corporate governance and business policy. This would naturally require in most cases reporting directly to the owner or CEO overseeing the very business on which the CLO is expected to be familiar with and advise on the most confidential level.  This requires the CLO/general counsel to work closely with each of the other officers, and their departments, to appropriately be aware and advise.&lt;ref name="ACC"&gt;The 2011 In-House Counsel Compensation Survey, Question 10,[http://www.acc.com/chapters/socal/upload/2011-In-House-Counsel-Compensation-Survey_4-13-11.pdf] Profiles of In-House Counsel 2006 [http://www.acc.com/vl/public/Surveys/loader.cfm?csModule=security/getfile&amp;amp;pageid=16297] Who Does Your Counsel Report To? (2001) (The Majority Report to the CEO)[http://www.acc.com/legalresources/resource.cfm?show=145939]&lt;/ref&gt;

Historically, general counsel often handled administrative tasks while outside lawyers in [[Practice of law|private practice]] handled more complex legal work. Since the 1980s, however, the general counsel position has become increasingly prominent in multinational companies, often directly advising the [[board of directors]] in place of outside lawyers. General counsel are now often among the most highly paid executives of major American corporations, and prominent American government lawyers and law firm partners are often hired for general counsel roles at prominent companies. Similar trends are also being seen in the United Kingdom and other countries.&lt;ref name=hls&gt;{{cite web|last=Heineman|first=Ben W.|title=General Counsel as Lawyer-Statesman|url=http://www.law.harvard.edu/programs/plp/pdf/General_Counsel_as_Lawyer-Statesman.pdf|publisher=Harvard Law School Program on the Legal Profession|accessdate=20 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

General counsel often have broad roles encompassing [[crisis management]], [[Regulatory compliance|compliance]] reporting management and [[public policy]] advocacy. Many companies also hire [[in-house counsel]] to handle specialized tasks such as [[tax]] work, [[mergers and acquisitions]], [[labor law]] and [[intellectual property]], sometimes building in-house practice groups that rival the practices of major law firms.&lt;ref name=hls /&gt;

==Organizations==

===Global===

====The Association of Corporate Counsel====
{{press release section|date=December 2016}}
{{main|Association of Corporate Counsel}}
The Association of Corporate Counsel ("ACC") has 35,000 general counsel, chief legal officer and other in-house counsel members located in 90 countries. ACC was founded as the American Corporate Counsel Association in 1982 and now includes more than 55 chapters, including in Argentina, Canada (four chapters), Europe, Israel, the Middle East and Singapore. Members have access to networking opportunities and education events through their regional chapter affiliations as well as global connections across practice area, job title and industry. ACC provides members with resources to deliver services and advice to their companies, promotes the value of in-house legal services and advocates on behalf of general counsel. For its general counsel and chief legal officer members, ACC hosts roundtables where members discuss current practice trends and issues.

===United States===

====The General Counsel Forum====

The Forum is an association of 700 general counsel and senior managing counsel. The non-profit organization was founded in the fall of 1998 as the Dallas-Fort Worth General Counsel’s Management Practices Forum (“DFWGCMPF”). The association is a partnership between in-house members and outside counsel, known as underwriters. Members are general counsel and managing counsel of corporations, non-profit organizations and government agencies. The mission of the Forum is to improve the professional lives of general counsel and managing counsel through meaningful opportunities for peer-to-peer interaction and knowledge exchange, mentoring through professional development in legal best practices, ethics, governance, and compliance. In November 2000, the DFWGCMPF changed its name to The Texas General Counsel Forum, also known as The Forum, and in the following year the Houston Chapter was formed, and then the Austin-San Antonio Chapter was founded. In July 2005, the Forum hired a Chief Executive Officer with the mandate to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of the organization, expand membership, and launch the organization nationally. In November 2009, the Board of Directors approved expanding the Forum nationally, and dropped the reference to Texas, becoming simply The General Counsel Forum. In the fall of 2012, the General Counsel Forum founded the Chicago Chapter.

====Silicon Valley Association of General Counsel====

The Silicon Valley Association of General Counsel (SVAGC) is a business league of chief legal officers from over 100 leading companies in the technology and life science sectors. Member companies include publicly traded corporations, private ventures and multinational subsidiaries located throughout the San Francisco Bay Area with operations in software, electronics, power technology, biotechnology, medical devices, health informatics, analytics, materials science, cleantech, fintech, telecommunications, network infrastructure, e-commerce and Internet services, artificial intelligence and machine learning.

The SVAGC hosts a series of monthly luncheons featuring expert presentations and off-the-record discussion about topics of professional interest.  It also assists members who wish to survey their peers or pose questions on particular issues, and cooperates in special projects such as the ''All Hands Meeting'', an annual multi-track conference at the Santa Clara Convention Center, attended by general and staff counsel from hundreds of member and nonmember legal departments in the technology and life science sectors.

The SVAGC is a successor to the Peninsula Association of General Counsel (PAGC), formed in the early 1980s. In 2003, the SVAGC was formally organized as a California mutual benefit nonprofit corporation with the assistance of Ivy Associates, a consultancy to the Silicon Valley legal community that provides organizational support for the SVAGC and produces the All Hands Meeting.  Only SVAGC members, speakers and invited guests may attend monthly luncheons, which are funded by modest membership dues.  Individuals may join the SVAGC when they are the chief legal officer of a company with operations in Northern California that is publicly traded or which meets alternative criteria for private companies.  Some SVAGC members serve as general counsel for companies headquartered outside Northern California, and attend meetings when business travel brings them into the SF Bay Area.

===United Kingdom===
In the [[United Kingdom]] a group of general counsel, called the GC100, was officially launched on 9 March 2005 and brings together the senior legal officers of more than eighty five [[FTSE 100]] companies. The GC100 group was created in response to the increasing volume and complexity of domestic and international law and regulation which impacts on UK listed companies. The group was formed with the support of [[Practical Law Company]] which acts as its secretariat.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | date=2005-02-25 | url=http://www.practicallaw.com/2-200-3996 | title=The GC100 Group | publisher=[[Practical Law Company|Practical Law]] | accessdate=2008-01-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The main objectives of the GC100 are to:

* Provide a forum for practical and business focused input on key areas of legislative and policy reform common to UK listed companies.
* Enable members to share best practice in relation to law, risk management, compliance and other areas of common interest.

Membership of the GC100 is by invitation only. At the AGM on the 16 January 2007 members voted in favour of extending membership to [[company secretary|company secretaries]] as well as general counsel in the FTSE 100. The formal name of the GC100 is now "The Association of General Counsel and Company Secretaries of the FTSE100", although it will continue to be known as the GC100.

Mark Harding, the first chair of the GC100, has stated that the GC100 is not a campaigning body, although they work closely with the [[FD100]] (a similar grouping of [[blue chip (stock market)|blue chip]] finance directors).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | date=2008-01-24 | url=http://www.legalweek.com/Navigation/34/Articles/1088580/Corporate+Counsel+High-profile+but+low-key+-+has+GC100+lived+up+to+its.html | title=Corporate Counsel: High-profile but low-key - has GC100 lived up to its promise? | publisher=legalweek.com | accessdate=2008-01-25 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20080407130433/http://www.legalweek.com/Navigation/34/Articles/1088580/Corporate+Counsel+High-profile+but+low-key+-+has+GC100+lived+up+to+its.html &lt;!-- Bot retrieved archive --&gt; |archivedate = 2008-04-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Government Performance Coalition''' was created in 1999 by a group of organizations and researchers with the goal of presenting the [[President of the United States]], government managers, [[United States Congress|Congress]], the media, and the public views on the improvement of government management.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.seagov.org/initiatives/other.shtml|title=Performance Reporting for Government—Reporting initiatives|website=www.seagov.org|access-date=2018-08-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; The coalition maintains that it seeks to ensure a continued focus and attention to performance and management issues and to identify existing issues that need new attention, and refine past efforts and highlight related governance policies that affect performance.&lt;ref&gt;Mission statement from Government Performance Coalition Website: http://www.govresults.com/&lt;/ref&gt; The Coalition, comprising nearly two dozen organizations, meets regularly in Washington, D.C. to serve as a clearinghouse for its individual members’ respective agendas regarding government management improvement.  During presidential election years, the Coalition sponsors events to highlight the importance of good government management issues in the campaign and to prepare materials that would be helpful to the winning candidate’s incoming political appointees.

==Resource development==
The Coalition was initially formed to develop resource materials to support the eventual winner of the 2000 presidential campaign.  In that effort, it sponsored a series of forums on key management issues, such as [[human capital]], [[Finance|financial management]], and [[performance management]].  These forums and associated recommendations were compiled into a report given to the incoming administration for President George W. Bush.  In a memorandum dated December 20, 2000, the coalition identified critical issues that require new policy directions such as the high-risk areas in the General Accounting Office (e.g. [[Federal Aviation Administration|FAA]], [[United States Department of Defense|DOD]] financial management, [[Medicare (United States)|Medicare]], [[Housing and Urban Development Corporation|HUD]], student aid, superfund, [[NASA]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Memos to the President: Management Advice from the Nation's Top Public Administrators|last=Abramson|first=Mark|publisher=Rowman &amp; Littlefield|year=2001|isbn=0742522393|location=Lanham|pages=14}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many of the recommendations were subsequently used to frame his [[President's Management Agenda]]. 

In 2008, the Coalition members, both individually and collectively, sponsored a series of forums in 2008 with recommendations to the incoming Obama Administration to place an appropriate emphasis on performance. It recommended three broad initiatives: 1) implement a performance-based framework at agencies; 2) invest more in federal human resources; and, 3) mandate the use of innovation and technology to revolutionize government.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.govexec.com/oversight/2008/12/obama-urged-to-focus-on-performance-based-government/28197/|title=Obama urged to focus on performance-based government|work=Government Executive|access-date=2018-08-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; Barack Obama’s fiscal year 2010 budget has a section titled “Building a High-Performance Government,” with its first item being “Putting Performance First.”&lt;ref&gt;Office of Management and Budget, "The President's Fiscal Year 2010 Budget," ''Analytical Perspectives,'' "Building a High-Performance Government," Washington, DC (2009). http://www.whitehouse.gov/omb/budget/fy2010/assets/building.pdf. Retrieved 06-30-09.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Projects==
The Coalition members jointly sponsored the publication of a book as part of the 2004 presidential transition. That book, “Getting Results: A Guide for Federal Leaders and Managers”&lt;ref&gt;https://books.google.com/books?id=fPDHRFxxJEoC&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;ots=DRGPHYKWqX&amp;dq=Getting%20Results%3A%20A%20Guide%20for%20Federal%20Leaders%20and%20Managers&amp;pg=PP1 White, Barry, and Kathryn Newcomer, eds., "Getting Results: A Guide for Federal Leaders and Managers," Management Concepts and the George Washington University Center for Public Service Innovation (Washington, DC) 2005&lt;/ref&gt; was an orientation guide provided to incoming political appointees to help them be successful managers in the federal government. The coalition, through the Performance Institute, also trains thousands of government managers every year on performance-based topics as well as methodologies and best practices for transparency and citizen services.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.performanceinstitute.org/about-us/about/|title=About - The Performance Institute|work=The Performance Institute|access-date=2018-08-02|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

A February 2009 article in [[Government Executive magazine]] described the Coalition as “An unfunded organization with no professional staff, the coalition is run through the volunteer efforts of good government group leaders. Early in the Bush administration, the coalition received some funding for a joint book project on performance management advice, but it now operates primarily as a clearinghouse for its member organizations' efforts.”  The article continues:  “The loose structure isn't just a vehicle for agreement at the coalition. It's a requirement. Because of the variety of governance structures among the member groups, it's impossible for them all to commit to a concerted lobbying campaign or even formally endorse a program.”&lt;ref&gt;Rosenberg, Alyssa. “Gathering Good,” ''Government Executive'', February 2009: http://www.govexec.com/story_page.cfm?filepath=/features/0209-01/0209-01s3.htm&amp;oref=search&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''International Association for Technology Trade''' ('''IATT''') is a consortium of technology organizations, strategic advisors, government agencies and corporate members seeking to generate successful global business opportunities – with a key focus on [[China]] and [[emerging economies]]. IATT runs ongoing trade missions to developing regions, sponsors and co-promotes conferences and symposia, and provides strategic services to companies entering and expanding into [[emerging markets]].

==Recent noteworthy events==

===2006 Guangdong Province Educational Technology Buyers' Summit===

In June 2006, IATT hosted a high-level delegation from the '''[[Guangdong]] Province Department of Education''', visiting North America at summit meetings arranged by IATT in [[Toronto]], ON; [[Washington, DC]] and [[San Jose, CA]]. Highlights included meetings with representatives from '''[[Discovery Communications]]''', the [http://www.oraclefoundation.org '''Oracle Education Foundation'''] and '''[[Adobe Systems]]''' among other '''[[International Society for Technology in Education|ISTE]] 100''' companies. ISTE was a co-organizer of the summit, designed to introduce leading educational technology companies in North America to potential buyers in China.

===First Sino-American Forum of Intellectual Property Rights===

Efforts in 2005 to forge a partnership with the '''Patent Protection Association of China''' [http://ppac.org.cn/en/ '''(PPAC)'''] under the direction of China’s [[State Intellectual Property Office]] (SIPO) resulted in the first-ever ''Sino-American Forum of [[Intellectual Property]] Rights'', held in China’s booming [[Pearl River Delta]].&lt;ref&gt;Knezek, Don. [http://www.iste.org/AM/Template.cfm?Section=News_and_Events&amp;TEMPLATE=/CM/ContentDisplay.cfm&amp;CONTENTID=9374" "CEO's Update on China Expo and Intellectual Property Forum"], ''ISTE - News &amp; Events'', October 28, 2005&lt;/ref&gt; Attracting more than 500 government officials, business leaders and academics from throughout China and North America, IATT and PPAC co-organized the event.&lt;ref&gt;editor. [http://www.glosk.com/CH/Macao/-2657867/pages/Dongguan/69794_en.htm "Dongguan - Foreign Direct Investment"], ''Glosk.com'', November, 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

“IP continues to be a critical issue between China and the West, but what is especially exciting about this forum is the growing importance Chinese business leaders place on their own intellectual property. SIPO is racing toward half-a-million [[patent application]]s in 2005, 80% filed domestically – and the greatest number coming from the Pearl River Delta. Ultimately, Chinese business’ urging of the central government to protect IP rights will make a difference, because now it’s in everyone’s best interests.” (David McKnight, IATT president – speaking with a reporter from [[CCTV-9]] in China, October 2005)

===2005 China Educational Technology Conference &amp; Expo===

During the same timeframe, and with its EdTech association partner ISTE,&lt;ref&gt;Knezek, Don. [https://www.iste.org/AM/Template.cfm?Section=News_and_Events&amp;CONTENTID=8190&amp;TEMPLATE=/CM/ContentDisplay.cfm "Letter from the CEO—ISTE in China"], ''ISTE - News &amp; Events'', October 7, 2005&lt;/ref&gt; IATT co-organized what was identified as the world's largest educational technology conference and expo in [[Dongguan]], attracting nearly 40,000 attendees in its first year with leading EdTech speakers and a small number of non-China exhibitors from the US, Canada and UK.&lt;ref&gt;editor. [http://www.hellerreports.com/newsletters/ewhcontent/147.html "Business Opportunities in China – Find Out More During The Heller Reports' July 15th Roundtable Discussion"], ''The Heller Reports/Quality Education Data News Alert'', July 8, 2005&lt;/ref&gt;

Gharajedaghi's research interests has evolved from his "early training in information systems ... to operations research, behavioral sciences, and finally, for the last 25 years to the development design thinking as the third generation of systems thinking."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.domresearchlab.com/profile/jamshid-gharajedaghi Jamshid Gharajedaghi] at ''domresearchlab.com.'' Accessed 03-03-2015.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Work ==

=== Modeling of social systems ===
In the 1988 article "Mechanisms, organisms and social systems" Gharajedaghi and [[Russell L. Ackoff|Ackoff]] argue, that there is a fundamental flaw in the traditional way to think about [[social system]]s. They argued:

&lt;blockquote&gt;To think about anything requires an image or concept of it, a model. To think about a thing as complex as a social system most people use a model of something similar, simpler and more familiar. Traditionally, two types of models have been used in efforts to acquire information, knowledge and understanding of social systems: mechanistic and organismic. But, in a world of accelerating change, increasing uncertainty and growing complexity, it is becoming apparent that these are inadequate as guides to decision and action. The growing number of social crises and dilemmas that we face should be clear evidence that something is fundamentally wrong with the way we think about social systems.&lt;ref name="GA 1988"&gt;Gharajedaghi and Ackoff (1988, p. 289)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In their paper they have tried to describe and explain 

&lt;blockquote&gt;the deficiencies of the two traditional ways of thinking about social systems. We then develop a third type of model, one we believe does not suffer from these inadequacies, a social system model which seeks to penetrate beyond the nature of machine and organisms to understand social systems in their own right.&lt;ref name="GA 1988"/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

=== Systems thinking ===
Gharajedaghi present his work as third generation of systems thinking. In the first chapter of his 1999 book "Systems thinking" he explains his point of view: 

&lt;blockquote&gt;The analytical approach has remained essentially intact for nearly four hundred years, but systems thinking has already gone through three distinct generations of change. The first generation of systems thinking (operations research) dealt with the challenge of interdependency in the context of mechanical (deterministic) systems. The second generation of systems thinking (cybernetics and open systems) dealt with the dual challenges of interdependency and self-organization (neg-entropy)4 in the context of living systems. The third generation of systems thinking (design) responds to the triple challenge of interdependency, self-organization, and choice in the context of sociocultural systems.&lt;ref&gt;Gharajedaghi (2005, p. 16)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

=== Business architecture ===
{{see also|History of business architecture}}
In the 1990s the [[information age]] was unfolding&lt;ref&gt;[[Zachman, John A.]] "[http://www.cioindex.com/nm/articlefiles/63503-EAIssueForTheCenturyZachman.pdf Enterprise architecture: The issue of the century]." ''Database Programming and Design'' 10.3 (1997): 44-53.&lt;/ref&gt; changing the global market economy. With the businesses adapting, the new concept of business architecture was presented as promising alternative. Gharajedaghi (1999) explained the context:

&lt;blockquote&gt;In a global market economy with ever-increasing levels of disturbance, a viable business can no longer be locked into a single form or function. Success comes from a self-renewing capability to spontaneously create structures and functions that fit the moment. In this context, proper functioning of self-reference would certainly prevent the vacillations and the random search for new products/markets that have, over the past years, destroyed so many businesses.&lt;br&gt;In fact, the ability to continuously match the portfolio of internal competencies with the portfolio of emerging market opportunities is the foundation of the emerging concept of new business architecture ...&lt;ref&gt;Gharajedaghi (1999/2005, p. 152)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

According to Bodine and Hilty (2009) "important advances in this area borrowed from the operations discipline came in 1993 in the form of [[Michael Martin Hammer|Michael Hammer]] and [[James Champy]]'s book ''Reengineering the Corporation'', which introduced tools for mapping and optimizing business activities using process modeling. The [[Balanced Scorecard]] developed by [[Robert S. Kaplan|Robert Kaplan]] and [[David P. Norton|David Norton]] at about the same time enabled the business to measure overall corporate success against goals on qualitative as well as quantitative dimensions."&lt;ref name="BH 2009"&gt;Paul Arthur Bodine and Jack Hilty. "Business Architecture: An Emerging Profession," at ''businessarchitectsassociation.org,'' Business Architects Association Institute. April 28, 2009.

'''Jehan Boinebroke''' († 1286 in Douai) was a French merchant from [[Douai]], and 'undoubtedly the most famous merchant-draper "capitalist" to be found in medieval western Europe'.&lt;ref&gt;John H. Munro, 'Medieval Woollens: Textiles, Textile Technology and Industrial Organisation, ''c''. 800-1500', in ''The Cambridge History of Western Textiles, Volume 1'', ed. by D. T. Jenkins (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 2003), pp. 181-227 (219).&lt;/ref&gt;

==Life==

Boinebroke was nine times alderman (''échevin'') of his city and accumulated in the course of his life a considerable fortune. He had [[The medieval English wool trade|wool imported from England]] to Douai and had peasant women spin it into yarn. He also developed a dying factory. He made his workers live in its houses at inflated rents. Already in 1245 he faced a riot by artisans and workers in Douai. In 1280 there was again unrest, which extended from Ypres to Tournai and Douai, but in Douai Boinebroke overcame the rebellion.

In his will Boinebroke decreed that the executor should first pay his debts and make up for all the wrong caused by him before his property should go to his four children. When he died in 1286 at Douai, published numerous individuals that submitted their complaints. The complaints grew into a 5.5 m long parchment.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=Ukw7guxYBxcC&amp;pg=PA178&amp;lpg=PA178&amp;dq=jehan+boinebroke&amp;source=web&amp;ots=_s6vTbGoXM&amp;sig=qYagR3RR1ehO1zDY60vkinq3PwQ#PPA178,M1 Edith Ennen: Die europäische Stadt des Mittelalters. O. O. 1987, p. 178].&lt;/ref&gt;

Modern historians, in the tradition of [[Karl Marx]], have often viewed Boinebroke's business activity as an early example [[Capitalism|capitalist exploitation]] of his workers. However, in the assessment of John H. Munro,
:he was no 'industrial capitalist', a term that is clearly an anachronism for this era. He was instead principally a wool merchant, dealing in English and domestic wools, and his role as a cloth merchant was only secondary ... he owned land, with many properties in Douia itself and a sheep farm outside. As a merchant, he provided wool on credit to industrial drapers, who pledged their cloths, looms and sometimes even their home as security; and some of them also rented their houses from him. But most of his wage-earning employees were those required for the wool trade itself: sorters, beaters, washers and some wool dyers (who worked in his dyehouse). Although Boinebroke did employ a few others in cloth making, chiefly to work some tentering frames that he owned, there is absolutely no evidence that he ever directly supervised the central processes of cloth production.&lt;ref&gt;John H. Munro, 'Medieval Woollens: Textiles, Textile Technology and Industrial Organisation, ''c''. 800-1500', in ''The Cambridge History of Western Textiles, Volume 1'', ed. by D. T. Jenkins (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 2003), pp. 181-227 (219).&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Jesse William Markham''' (April 16, 1916 – June 21, 2009) was an [[United States|American]] [[economist]]. Markham was best known for his work on antitrust policy, price theory and industrial organization. Markham was the Charles Edward Wilson Professor of Business Administration at [[Harvard Business School]] (HBS), and the former chief economist to the [[Federal Trade Commission]].

==Early life and education==
Markham was born in [[Sharps, Virginia]]. Markham attended the [[University of Richmond]], where he played baseball.&lt;ref name=HBS&gt;{{cite web|title=Professor Emeritus Jesse W. Markham Dead at 93|url=http://www.hbs.edu/news/releases/Pages/jessemarkham.aspx|publisher=Harvard Business School|accessdate=31 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1941, he earned an undergraduate degree in economics and was elected to [[Phi Beta Kappa]].&lt;ref name=HBS/&gt; After graduating from Richmond, he began graduate school in economics that fall at [[Johns Hopkins University]].&lt;ref name=HBS/&gt;

In 1942, Markham enlisted in [[World War II]] where he served as an officer in the [[U.S. Navy]] for three years.&lt;ref name=HBS/&gt; Markham served in the Atlantic theater on the {{USS|Augusta|CA-31|6}}, which was the heavy cruiser acting as the flagship for the [[Normandy invasion]], where he saw combat from the first attack on [[D-Day]].&lt;ref name=obit&gt;{{cite web|title=Jesse William Markham Obituary|url=http://www.legacy.com/obituaries/bostonglobe/obituary.aspx?pid=128846620|publisher=Boston Globe|accessdate=31 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After the War, Markham began studies at [[Harvard University]], and earned a master's degree in 1947 and a Ph.D. in 1949 in economics.&lt;ref name=HBS/&gt;

==Career==
In 1948, Markham began his career as an associate professor at [[Vanderbilt University]] where he worked until 1952.&lt;ref name=obit/&gt;

===Federal Trade Commission===
In 1953, the [[Federal Trade Commission]] selected Markham to be the FTC's chief economist. Markham recalled: "At a time when Congress had passed an act putting arbitrary constraints on corporate mergers, the Eisenhower administration saw me as a voice in favor of a standard of [[effective competition|workable]], as opposed to perfect, competition. I could advocate the benefits of letting certain firms work together to foster innovation, which buyers value just as much as temporary price advantages - the traditional yardstick of competitiveness."&lt;ref name=HBS/&gt; Markham left the FTC in 1955.&lt;ref name=HBS/&gt;

In 1964, Markham wrote an article for the [[Columbia Law Review]] entitled "The Federal Trade Commission's Use of Economics."&lt;ref name=colum&gt;{{cite web|last1=Markham|first1=Jesse W.|title=The Federal Trade Commission's Use of Economics|jstor=1120730}}&lt;/ref&gt; Markham criticized the FTC for relying on oversimplified rules of thumb, instead of the tedious analysis Congress seemed to have in mind as one of the agency's principal functions.&lt;ref name=ABA&gt;{{cite web|last1=Silberman|first1=Alan|title=The FTC as an Antitrust Enforcement Agency, Volume 1|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=VsY7TzxtyCAC&amp;pg=PA95&amp;lpg=PA95&amp;dq=markham+federal+trade+commission&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=-Nl2mBUA_f&amp;sig=cTfqr86oAM-ccatafRZ2V2anMUQ&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0CCgQ6AEwAmoVChMIwfe5koaFxwIV0JeICh3HmQFB#v=onepage&amp;q=markham%20federal%20trade%20commission&amp;f=false|publisher=ABA|accessdate=31 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2003, Markham returned to the FTC to comment on economists’ role in antitrust during the 1950s and 1960s.&lt;ref name=FTC&gt;{{cite web|title=FTC History: Bureau of Economics Contributions to Law Enforcement, Research, and Economic Knowledge and Policy|url=https://www.ftc.gov/sites/default/files/documents/public_events/roundtable-former-directors-bureau-economics/directorstablegood.pdf|website=FTC.gov|publisher=Federal Trade Commission|accessdate=31 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Professor of economics===
From 1955 until 1968, Markham was Professor of Economics at Princeton University, but visited as a professor in the Harvard economics department and at the Harvard Business School.&lt;ref name=HBS/&gt; In 1958, Markham served as an economic delegate for the [[European Common Market]] (now the OEEC).&lt;ref name=obit/&gt; Markham was [[Dennis Mueller]]'s thesis advisor at Princeton.&lt;ref name=exemp&gt;{{cite web|last1=Backhouse|first1=Roger|title=Exemplary Economists: North America, Volume 1|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=SHnGSiiK4dUC&amp;pg=PA359&amp;lpg=PA359&amp;dq=dennis+c+mueller+markham&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=M-G8-PouS7&amp;sig=NY4XlAJussik8cBCXdhKGKSRv4U&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0CDYQ6AEwBGoVChMIvefV2o2FxwIVUDWICh3MXgBK#v=onepage&amp;q=dennis%20c%20mueller%20markham&amp;f=false|publisher=Edward Elgar|accessdate=31 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1968, Markham accepted [[George P. Baker]]'s invitation to serve as Harvard Business School's Charles E. Wilson Professor of Business Administration.&lt;ref name=HBS/&gt; While at HBS, Markham worked alongside [[Paul Samuelson]], the first American Nobel laureate in economics.&lt;ref name=sara&gt;{{cite web|last1=Cox|first1=Billy|title=Noted economist wintered in Sarasota|url=http://www.heraldtribune.com/article/20091215/article/912151054|publisher=Herald-Tribune|accessdate=31 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1974, he served as a Commissioner on the [[Federal Trade Commission]].&lt;ref name=obit/&gt;

Markham retired from HBS in 1982, but continued to teach at the [[Harvard Extension School]] and at [[Emory University]] at the [[Carter Center]].&lt;ref name=HBS/&gt;&lt;ref name=obit/&gt; In 1989, he served as a People to People Diplomacy Mission Delegate to the USSR.&lt;ref name=obit/&gt;

==Personal life==
Markham was a part-time resident of [[Longboat Key, Florida]].&lt;ref name=sara/&gt; Markham married Penelope Anton in 1944, and they had three children: Elizabeth (Betsy) McLean, John James Emanuel, II, and Jesse William, Jr.&lt;ref name=obit/&gt;

Typically an individual will document the events of the conversation as soon as possible after the occurrence.&lt;ref name=memcon /&gt; All material statements and discussed items are quoted and described as accurately as possible soon after the discussion and filed for future reference.&lt;ref name=memcon&gt;{{citation|first=Lawrence|last=O'Donnell|authorlink=Lawrence O'Donnell|work=[[The Last Word with Lawrence O'Donnell]]|publisher=[[MSNBC]]|date=May 16, 2017|title=MEMCON}}&lt;/ref&gt; Memcons function as documentation of historical events, such as conversations between heads of state and law enforcement officials.&lt;ref name=ford&gt;{{citation|url=https://www.fordlibrarymuseum.gov/library/guides/findingaid/Memoranda_of_Conversations.asp|title=Summary Description|work=National Security Adviser. Memoranda of Conversations, 1973-1977|publisher=[[Gerald R. Ford Presidential Library and Museum]]|access-date=May 17, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Specific developments discussed, the time of the meeting, location, and individuals in attendance are all documented in-depth within the memo.&lt;ref name=memcon /&gt;&lt;ref name=memfile&gt;{{citation|url=http://www.weeklystandard.com/a-brief-history-of-the-memo-to-the-file/article/2008086|first=Eric|last=Felten|title=A Brief History of the 'Memo to the File'|date=May 17, 2017|work=[[The Weekly Standard]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[United States Department of Justice]] attorneys and [[Federal Bureau of Investigation]] [[special agent]]s commonly make use of memoranda of conversation.&lt;ref name=memcon /&gt; A majority of intermediate-rank managerial staff and bureaucrats within the U.S. federal government consistently make use of the method. The creation of a memorandum of understanding allows federal employees to memorialize and keep a record of their conversations and transactions.&lt;ref name=memfile /&gt;

Memoranda to file are used in investigations in the private sector. For example, the [[fraud]] unit of a large corporation may use memoranda to file, to report individual interviews and significant telephone conversations. Generally, "the memorandum will show the name of the author, date of preparation, the case name or number, and the specific subject covered. It will also contain the detailed narrative of the event, interview, or other investigative activity described and should be written as close in time as circumstances permit to those events."&lt;ref name=sennewald&gt;{{citation|first1=Charles A.|last1= Sennewald|first2=John K.|last2= Tsukayama|title=The Process of Investigation: Concepts and Strategies for Investigators in the Private Sector|edition=4th|publisher=[[Butterworth-Heinemann]]|year=2015|pages=189-90|isbn=978-0128001660}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
{{wikisource|Memorandum of Conversation, by the Officer in Charge of Korean Affairs in the Office of Northeast Asian Affairs July 9, 1951}}
Former Deputy Assistant to the President for National Security Affairs and subsequently Assistant to the President for National Security Affairs, [[Brent Scowcroft]], who served as such in the U.S. presidential administration of [[Gerald R. Ford]], kept copious documentation of his meetings in the form of memorandum of conversation.&lt;ref name=ford /&gt; He would take handwritten notes, and immediately have them transcribed in typewritten format with the assistance of his staff from the [[United States National Security Council]].&lt;ref name=ford /&gt; The [[Gerald R. Ford Presidential Library and Museum]] contains over 1,000 such memorandum of conversation documents relating to the [[Presidency of Richard Nixon]] and [[Presidency of Gerald Ford]], mainly related to [[national security of the United States]].&lt;ref name=ford /&gt;

'''Michael Monroe Lewis''' (born October 15, 1960) is an American [[financial journalist]] and bestselling [[non-fiction]] author.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://authors.simonandschuster.com/Michael-Lewis/4349 |publisher=[[Simon &amp; Schuster]] |title=Michael Lewis author page |accessdate=February 22, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;  He has also been a contributing editor to ''[[Vanity Fair (magazine)|Vanity Fair]]'' since 2009.

==Early life==
Lewis was born in [[New Orleans]], the son of [[corporate lawyer]] J. Thomas Lewis and [[community activist]] Diana Monroe Lewis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.businessinsider.com/the-life-of-michael-lewis-2012-6|title=The Amazing Life Of Wall Street's Favorite Writer, Michael Lewis|author=|date=|website=businessinsider.com|accessdate=23 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; He attended [[Princeton University]] where he earned a [[cum laude]] bachelor's degree in [[art history]] in 1982 and was a member of the [[Ivy Club]].&lt;ref name=Diane_wedding/&gt; He went on to work with New York City art dealer [[Daniel Wildenstein]] for a short while. In an interview with Charlie Rose, Lewis shared that his initial ambition was to become an art historian, but was quickly dissuaded once he realized that there were no jobs available for art historians and even the handful would not pay much.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Rose|first1=Charlie|title=Interview with Michael Lewis|url=https://charlierose.com/videos/31161|website=www.charlierose.com|publisher=Charlie Rose|accessdate=18 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Lewis subsequently enrolled at the [[London School of Economics]] and received an [[Master of Arts|MA]] in [[economics]] in 1985.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.greatertalent.com/MichaelLewis/|title=Michael Lewis |publisher=[[Greater Talent Network (GTN)|Greater Talent Network]] Speakers Bureau |accessdate=2012-03-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=[[Contemporary Authors Online]] |publisher=[[Gale (publisher)|Gale]] |year=2011 |location=Detroit |chapter=Michael Lewis |accessdate=2012-03-04 |chapter-url=http://ic.galegroup.com/ic/bic1/ReferenceDetailsPage/ReferenceDetailsWindow?displayGroupName=Reference&amp;disableHighlighting=false&amp;prodId=BIC1&amp;action=e&amp;windowstate=normal&amp;catId=&amp;documentId=GALE%7CH1000059769&amp;mode=view&amp;userGroupName=fairfax_main&amp;jsid=79fc6c90ca7fafc7735a82db82279d9a |id=GALE&amp;#124;H1000059769 | via= Fairfax County Public Library}} Gale Biography In Context. {{subscription}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lewis was hired by [[Salomon Brothers]], stayed for a while in New York for their training program and then relocated to [[London]] where he worked at Salomon's London office as a bond salesman for a few years.&lt;ref name="imf"&gt;{{cite web|title=One on one with Christine Lagarde, featuring Michael Lewis|url=https://www.imf.org/external/POS_Meetings/SeminarDetails.aspx?SeminarId=186|website=www.imf.org|publisher=IMF (International monetary fund)|accessdate=30 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Writing==
Lewis described his experiences at Salomon and the evolution of the [[Mortgage-backed security|mortgage-backed bond]] in ''[[Liar's Poker]]'' (1989). In ''[[The New New Thing]]'' (1999), he investigated the then-booming [[Silicon Valley]] and discussed obsession with innovation. Four years later, Lewis wrote ''[[Moneyball]]'', in which he investigated the success of [[Billy Beane]] and the [[Oakland Athletics|Oakland A's]]. In August 2007, he wrote an article about [[catastrophe bond]]s entitled "In Nature's Casino" that appeared in ''[[The New York Times Magazine]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.nytimes.com/2007/08/26/magazine/26neworleans-t.html | work=[[New York City|The New York Times Magazine]] | title=In Nature's Casino | first=Michael | last=Lewis | date=2007-08-26 | accessdate=2010-05-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Lewis has worked for ''[[The Spectator]]'',&lt;ref name=Writer_Directory/&gt; ''The New York Times Magazine'', as a columnist for [[Bloomberg L.P.|Bloomberg]], as a senior editor and campaign correspondent to ''[[The New Republic]]'',&lt;ref name="Future Just Happened"&gt;{{cite news|title=the future just happened|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/hi/english/static/in_depth/programmes/2001/future/lewis.stm|work=BBC|publisher=BBC|accessdate=14 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; and a visiting fellow at the [[University of California, Berkeley]]. He wrote the ''Dad Again'' column for ''[[Slate (magazine)|Slate]]''. Lewis worked for [[Conde Nast Portfolio]] but in February 2009 left to join ''[[Vanity Fair (magazine)|Vanity Fair]]'', where he became a contributing editor.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.observer.com/2008/media/graydon-s-big-get-raids-portfolio-michael-lewis |title=Graydon's Big Get: Raids Portfolio for Michael Lewis |author=John Koblin |date=October 7, 2008 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090415010556/http://www.observer.com/2008/media/graydon-s-big-get-raids-portfolio-michael-lewis |archivedate=April 15, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vanityfair.com/magazine/bios/michael_lewis/search?contributorName=Michael%20Lewis |title=Michael Lewis |work=''[[Vanity Fair (magazine)|Vanity Fair]]'' |accessdate=July 20, 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090711100318/http://www.vanityfair.com/magazine/bios/michael_lewis/search?contributorName=Michael%20Lewis |archivedate=July 11, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In September 2011, after the successful release of the [[Moneyball (film)|film adaptation]] of his book ''Moneyball'', it was reported that Lewis planned to take on "a much more active role in the what could be the next film based on one of his books" and would start writing a script for a ''Liar's Poker'' film.&lt;ref name="Liars Poker Script"&gt;{{cite news|last=Lewis|first=Andy|title='Moneyball' Author Michael Lewis to Script 'Liar's Poker' for Warner Bros.

In 2013, in ''Vanity Fair'', Lewis wrote on the injustice of the prosecution of ex-[[Goldman Sachs]] programmer [[Sergey Aleynikov]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2013/09/michael-lewis-goldman-sachs-programmer |title= Michael Lewis: Did Goldman Sachs Overstep in Criminally Charging Its Ex-Programmer? |author=&lt;!--Not stated--&gt; |date=September 2013 |website=VanityFair.com |publisher= |access-date=31 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; who is given an entire chapter in ''Flash Boys''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://dealbook.nytimes.com/2011/03/18/ex-goldman-programmer-sentenced-to-8-years-for-theft-of-trading-code |title=Former Goldman Programmer Gets 8-year Jail Term for Code Theft |author=Azam Ahmed |date=March 18, 2011 |website=[[NYTimes.com]] |access-date=5 November 2017 |quote=A former Goldman Sachs computer programmer convicted of stealing source code from the firm was sentenced on Friday to more than eight years in prison, capping a case that had shone a rare spotlight on the world of lightning-fast computer-driven trading.}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Flash Boys'', which looked at [[high-frequency trading]] of Wall Street and other markets, was released in March 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://books.wwnorton.com/books/detail.aspx?ID=4294981104|title=Flash Boys {{!}} W. W. Norton &amp; Company|website=books.wwnorton.com|access-date=2018-10-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2018, Lewis wrote and narrated, ''The Coming Storm'' for [[Audible Studios]], who released the short non-fiction story as part of their new Audible Originals series of [[audio books]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.audible.com/pd/The-Coming-Storm-Audiobook/B07F43574T|title=The Coming Storm|last=Lewis|first=Michael|publisher=|year=2018|isbn=|location=|pages=|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reception==
A best-selling author, Lewis has drawn both supporters and vocal detractors. In a review of ''Moneyball'', [[Dan Ackman]] of ''[[Forbes (magazine)|Forbes]]'' said that Lewis had a special talent: "He can walk into an area already mined by hundreds of writers and find gems there all along but somehow missed by his predecessors".&lt;ref name="Ackman Forbes"&gt;{{cite web|last=Ackman|first=Dan|title=''Moneyball: The Art Of Winning An Unfair Game''|url=https://www.forbes.com/2003/05/28/cx_da_0528bookreview.html|work=Forbes|accessdate=14 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; A ''[[New York Times]]'' piece said that "no one writes with more narrative panache about money and finance than Mr. Lewis", praising his ability to use his subject's stories to show the problems with the systems around them.&lt;ref name="Foresaw the Meltdown"&gt;{{cite news|last=Kakutani|first=Michiko|title=Investors Who Foresaw the Meltdown|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2010/03/15/books/15book.html|accessdate=14 November 2012|newspaper=The New York Times|date=14 March 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Lewis has been criticized for writing a 2007 article in ''[[Bloomberg News|Bloomberg]]'' criticizing economists at the [[World Economic Forum]] for expressing views on how the world wasn't pricing risk appropriately.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Lewis|first1=Michael|title=Davos Is for Wimps, Ninnies, Pointless Skeptics: Michael Lewis|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=newsarchive&amp;sid=aaagOLYMd4yg|publisher=Bloomberg News|date=30 January 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Critics from outside the [[financial industry]] have also criticized Lewis for what they consider to be inaccuracies in his writing. In a 2011 column in ''[[The Atlantic]]'', American journalist and sports author [[Allen Barra]] takes issue with Lewis's characterization of [[Major League Baseball]] in his 2003 book ''Moneyball''. Barra writes: "From a historical standpoint, Lewis is, well, way off base. By the end of the 20th century baseball had achieved a greater level of competitive balance than at any time in the game's history... ''Moneyball'' doesn't just get the state of present-day baseball wrong; it also misrepresents the history of the sport."&lt;ref name="Moneyball"&gt;{{cite news|last=Barra|first=Allen|title=The Many Problems with 'Moneyball'|url=https://www.theatlantic.com/entertainment/archive/2011/09/the-many-problems-with-moneyball/245769/|accessdate=13 July 2014|newspaper=New York Times|date=13 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Lewis's ''[[Flash Boys: A Wall Street Revolt]]'' ignited a new round of controversy surrounding [[high-frequency trading]]. At a [[House Financial Services Committee]] hearing in April 2014, [[Mary Jo White]], former Wall Street insider (as a Debevoise &amp; Plimpton litigations lawyer primarily for Wall Street financial firms),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2015/02/24/business/dealbook/sec-hamstrung-by-its-leaders-legal-ties.html|title=She Runs S.E.C. He's a Lawyer. Recusals and Headaches Ensue.|author=|date=23 February 2015|publisher=|accessdate=29 April 2018|via=NYTimes.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; who later served as the [[U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission]] (SEC) Chair, denied the theme of Lewis's book, stating that "The markets are not rigged."&lt;ref name="MJWhite"&gt;{{cite news|last=Lynch|first=Sarah H.|title=SEC chair to Congress: 'The markets are not rigged'|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/2014/04/29/us-sec-highspeed-trading-idUSBREA3S0OO20140429|accessdate=10 June 2014|newspaper=Reuters|date=29 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; One month later, in June 2014, White announced that the [[US Security and Exchange Commission|SEC]] would undergo a new round of regulatory review in response to concerns about [[dark pools]] and market structure.&lt;ref name="SECreview"&gt;{{cite news|last=Alden|first=William|title=S.E.C.

Lewis's ''[[The Undoing Project]]'' was widely praised by book critics,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://lithub.com/bookmarks/reviews/the-undoing-project-a-friendship-that-changed-our-minds/|title=Bookmarks reviews of The Undoing Project by Michael Lewis|publisher=LitHub|accessdate=February 8, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; with [[Glenn C. Altschuler]] arguing in the ''[[Pittsburgh Post-Gazette]]'' that it "may well be his best book."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.post-gazette.com/ae/books/2017/01/15/The-Undoing-Project-How-two-Israeli-psychologists-changed-the-world/stories/201701150039|title='The Undoing Project': How two Israeli psychologists changed the world|last=Altschuler|first=Glenn C.|newspaper=Pittsburgh Post-Gazette|date=January 15, 2017|accessdate=February 8, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Personal life==
Lewis has been married three times. He was married to Diane de Cordova Lewis&lt;ref name=Diane_wedding&gt;{{cite news|newspaper=[[The New York Times]] |title=Diane deCordova Wed at Princeton |date=December 29, 1985 |accessdate=2012-03-04 |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1985/12/29/style/diane-decordova-wed-at-princeton.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; and then to former [[CNBC]] correspondent [[Kate Bohner]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=[[The Last Tycoons: The Secret History of Lazard Freres &amp; Co.]]|last=Cohan|first=William D.|publisher=|year=|isbn=|location=|page=401|pages=|chapter=14: It's a White Man's World|authorlink=William D.

'''Morehead Planetarium and Science Center''' is located on the campus of the [[University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill]].  It is one of the oldest and largest planetariums in the United States having welcomed more than 7 million visitors by its 60th anniversary in 2009.&lt;ref name="sundial"&gt;{{cite news|title=Wow, What a Place|date=Spring 2009|work=Sundial|publisher=Morehead Planetarium and Science Center}}&lt;/ref&gt;  As a unit of the university, Morehead receives about one-third of its funding through state sources, one-third through ticket and gift sales, and one-third through gifts and grants.

First opened in 1949, the [[planetarium]] was used to train [[Project Gemini|Gemini]] and [[Apollo program|Apollo]] program [[astronaut]]s in [[celestial navigation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.moreheadplanetarium.org/index.cfm?fuseaction=page&amp;filename=astronauts.html|title=Astonauts who Trained at Morehead Planetarium|work=Morehead Planetarium|publisher=[[University of North Carolina]]|accessdate=4 February 2010|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20040924070616/http://www.moreheadplanetarium.org/index.cfm?fuseaction=page&amp;filename=astronauts.html|archivedate=24 September 2004|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Until the late 1990s, it contained one of the largest working Copernican [[orrery|orreries]] in the world. The facility was donated to the university by alumnus [[John Motley Morehead III]] who invested more than $3 million in the facility.&lt;ref name="sundial"/&gt;

== History ==
Morehead Planetarium opened on May 10, 1949 after seventeen months of construction. The first planetarium in the South, it was the sixth to be built in the United States.&lt;ref name="ley196502"&gt;{{Cite magazine

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Designed by the same architects who planned the [[Jefferson Memorial]], the cost of its construction, more than $23,000,000 in today’s dollars, made it the most expensive building ever built in North Carolina at the time. Morehead Planetarium was officially dedicated during a ceremony held on May 10, 1949.&lt;ref name="sundial" /&gt;
[[File:Morehead Planetarium Sundial.JPG|thumb|left|270px|The [[sundial]] in front of Morehead Planetarium.]]
Since [[Carl Zeiss AG|Zeiss]], the German firm that produced planetarium projectors, had lost most of its factories during World War II, there were very few projectors available at the time. Morehead had to travel to Sweden, where he had previously served as American ambassador, to purchase a Zeiss Model II to serve as the heart of North Carolina’s new planetarium.

''Let There Be Light'' was the planetarium's first show.

===NASA===
From 1959 through 1975 every astronaut in the [[Project Mercury|Mercury]], [[Project Gemini|Gemini]], [[Apollo program|Apollo]], [[Skylab]], and [[Apollo–Soyuz Test Project]] programs spent hours in [[celestial navigation]] training at the planetarium. Morehead technicians developed simplified replicas of flight modules and tools for use in the training, often from plywood or cardboard.  A mockup simulating key parts of the Gemini capsule was constructed from plywood and mounted on a barber chair to enable changes in pitch and yaw.&lt;ref name=firstman&gt;{{cite book|last=Hansen|first=James R.|title=[[First Man: The Life of Neil A. Armstrong]]|publisher=Simon and Shuester|isbn=978-0-7432-5751-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Several of these items are on display at the planetarium.  That training may have helped save astronauts' lives on occasion.  Astronauts aboard [[Apollo 12]] called upon that training after their [[Saturn V]] rocket was hit by lightning twice during ascent, knocking spacecraft systems offline and requiring them to configure navigation systems based on fixes taken manually. [[Gordon Cooper]] used his training to make the most accurate landing of [[Project Mercury]] after a power failure affected navigational systems.&lt;ref name=training&gt;{{cite web|title=Astronaut training|url=http://www.moreheadplanetarium.org/regeneration/astronaut.php|publisher=University of North Carolina|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://archive.is/20130415125039/http://www.moreheadplanetarium.org/regeneration/astronaut.php|archivedate=2013-04-15|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Astronauts enjoyed soft drinks, cookies and other snacks during their intense hours-long training session, leading planetarium employees to create the code name "cookie time" to refer to the training sessions.  Occasionally, word of the sessions leaked out and noted clothing designer and Chapel Hill native [[Alexander Julian]] recalls meeting Mercury Astronauts during a visit to the planetarium while in junior high.&lt;ref name="sundial" /&gt;

The first astronaut to train at Morehead, in March 1964, was [[Neil Armstrong]].  Armstrong visited again only months before the 1969 launch of [[Apollo 11]], spending a total of 20 days at Morehead over 11 training sessions, more than any other astronaut.  Astronauts commented that the "large dome" was "highly realistic", calling the facility "superb".&lt;ref name=firstman /&gt;

In all, the astronauts who trained at the planetarium were [[Buzz Aldrin]], [[Joseph P. Allen]], [[William Anders]], [[Neil Armstrong]], [[Charles Bassett]], [[Alan Bean]], [[Frank Borman]], [[Vance D. Brand]], [[John S. Bull]], [[Scott Carpenter]], [[Gerald P.

== Fulldome planetarium ==
Morehead's planetarium seats about 240 people, with a dome that is {{convert|68|ft|m}} in diameter and {{convert|44|ft|m}} tall. It currently boasts two different projection systems.

In February 2010, Morehead introduced its new fulldome digital video (FDV) projection system, the largest FDV installation in the southeastern United States. The new system provides super-high-definition image resolution, 5.1 surround sound and a uniquely immersive planetarium experience. Funding for the new system was provided by GlaxoSmithKline, and the planetarium's star theater is now named the GlaxoSmithKline Fulldome Theater.

Morehead's historic [[planetarium projector|star projector]], a Carl Zeiss Model VI, was installed in 1969 and remained in limited use as of April 2011, primarily for field trip groups. This projector displays about 8,900 different stars on the dome overhead. The analog planetarium shows are a combined effort of the Zeiss projector, slide projectors and video projectors working together to form a multimedia experience.  Planetarium officials hope to display at least a portion of the projector somewhere in the center.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.newsobserver.com/news/counties/orange_county/story/306008.html?storylink=misearch|title=Digital system dazzles at Morehead Planetarium|last=FERRERI|first=ERIC|date=Jan 27, 2010|publisher=[[News and Observer]]|accessdate=8 February 2010}}{{dead link|date=January 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=charlotteobserver&gt;{{cite news|last=Ferreri|first=Eric|title=Planetarium projector being put to pasture|url=http://www.charlotteobserver.com/2011/04/23/2243524/planetarium-projector-being-put.html|newspaper=[[Charlotte Observer]]}}{{dead link|date=January 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; The projector was removed in August 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.newsobserver.com/2011/08/24/1431872/final-exit-for-a-fading-star.html|title=UNC Planetarium removes old projector|work=News and Observer|date=August 24, 2011|accessdate=August 24, 2011|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120512174648/http://www.newsobserver.com/2011/08/24/1431872/final-exit-for-a-fading-star.html|archivedate=May 12, 2012|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Exhibits ==
On February 23, 2007, Morehead opened its first interactive exhibit, ''Zoom In: Science at the Extremes''. It features current science at the extremes of size and scale, including research done by UNC scientists.

''The Ancient Carolinians'' opened on November 17, 2007. This exhibit explores the lives of the first people to live on the land now known as North Carolina, interpreting the use of 10,000-year-old artifacts from the Hardaway archaeological site. This exhibit is supported in part by the Alcoa Foundation, which donated the artifacts to the university. After January 1, 2009, the exhibit installation was removed so that ''The Ancient Carolinians'' could become Morehead's first traveling exhibit.

== Science stage ==
Morehead Planetarium and Science Center offers live, educator-led programs in its Science Stage. ''Science LIVE!'' shows present the foundations of science through experiments and demonstrations that often involve volunteers from the audience. ''Science 360'' programs are focused on bringing current science to audience members through images, video, demonstrations, and audience interaction.

== External programs ==
The DESTINY Traveling Science Learning Program, which was founded by UNC in 2000, became part of Morehead in 2006. DESTINY develops cutting-edge science curricula, provides professional development for science teachers (grades 6-12) and operates two mobile science labs that travel throughout North Carolina.

The PLANETS Portable Planetarium Program brings the fulldome planetarium experience to elementary schools that are too far from Morehead to plan a field trip to the center.

== Jupiter Fellowship ==
Each year, the Jupiter Committee (a volunteer group that assists in planning the Jupiter Ball fundraising gala for Morehead) awards the Jupiter Fellowship.  This award goes to the student employee(s) who submits the best proposal for a Morehead program, activity or innovation. The fellowship funds the implementation of the proposal.

== Morehead Observatory ==
Morehead Observatory, located on the east end of the top floor of the Morehead building, houses a {{convert|24|in|cm|adj=on}} Perkin-Elmer reflecting telescope operated by the UNC Physics and Astronomy Department.  Faint object observing is still possible with narrow wavelength filters to block the city lights of Chapel Hill.  The observatory supports research programs in bright star spectroscopy and optical counterparts of Gamma Ray Bursts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.physics.unc.edu/research/astro/morehead.php|title=Morehead Observatory |publisher=UNC Department of Physics|accessdate=2009-08-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Events==
Record setting crowds attended events for the [[Transit of Venus, 2012|2012 transit of Venus]]. Nearly 3000 crowded the planetarium, observatory, rooftop, and sidewalk outdrawing events at major planetariums in larger cities such as the [[Griffith Observatory]] in Los Angeles and [[Adler Planetarium]] in Chicago. Morehead opened the planetarium and observatory to the public, hosted astronomy talks and volunteers from local astronomy clubs with solar telescopes and distributed solar viewing glasses.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=2012 Annual Report|publisher=Morehead Planetarium and Science Center}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The company develops and produces medicines for a wide range of medical disciplines, including [[oncology]], [[anaphylaxis]], [[Management of HIV/AIDS|antiretrovirals]], [[Circulatory system|cardiovascular]], [[Respiratory system|respiratory]], [[dermatology]], [[immunology]], [[anesthesia]] and [[pain management]], [[Infection|infectious disease]], [[gastroenterology]], diabetology/[[endocrinology]], and women's healthcare.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.mylan.com/en/products/therapeutic-innovation|title=Therapeutic Innovation|website=www.mylan.com|access-date=2018-08-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2016, Mylan's pricing of the EpiPen, an [[epinephrine autoinjector]], became controversial and was widely referred to as "price gouging".  As a result, investigations were opened into whether Mylan had misclassified the EpiPen under the [[Medicaid Drug Rebate Program]], a common form of [[pharmaceutical fraud]].  In October 2016, Mylan settled these investigations with the U.S. Department of Justice, agreeing to pay $465 million and enter into a [[corporate integrity agreement]] concerning the rebate program. In a report published on June 12, 2017 Institutional Shareholder Services criticized Mylan for the "outsized compensation" of Mylan's directors. Former CEO [[Robert Coury]] received a $98 million 2016 pay package in spite of shareholder losses and the perceived harm to the company inflicted by the EpiPen controversies. The report urged Mylan's shareholders to oust all of Mylan's existing directors.&lt;ref name="CNN_CEO_revolt"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://money.cnn.com/2017/06/13/investing/epipen-mylan-exec-pay-shareholder-revolt/index.html?sr=twCNN061417epipen-mylan-exec-pay-shareholder-revolt0246AMStoryLink&amp;linkId=38675750 |title=EpiPen maker faces revolt over exec's $98 million pay package |first=Matt |last=Egan |work=CNN Money}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Stock==
On February 23, 1973, Mylan had its initial public offering (IPO),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mylan.com/en/investors/stock-history#|title=MYL Stock History - Mylan|publisher=|accessdate=August 25, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; becoming a [[publicly traded]] company on the [[Over-the-counter (finance)|OTC]] market under the [[ticker symbol]] MYLN. In 1976 the stock moved to [[NASDAQ]]. Their final stock move was in 1986, when their stock became available for trade on the [[New York Stock Exchange]] under the ticker symbol MYL. Currently, the stock is traded on the [[NASDAQ]].

==History==
===Founding to 1980===
Mylan Pharmaceuticals was founded as a drug distributor in 1961 by [[Milan Puskar]] and [[Don Panoz]].&lt;ref name="PuskarObit"/&gt; In 1966 Mylan began manufacturing [[penicillin G]] tablets as well as vitamins and other dietary supplements.&lt;ref name="PuskarObit"/&gt;&lt;ref name=NYTexpose1989/&gt;

Panoz left Mylan in 1969 and Puskar quit the company in 1973, as it grew and experienced financial difficulties. The board hired Roy McKnight as board chairman, who convinced Puskar to return in 1976.&lt;ref name=NYTexpose1989/&gt;

Mylan discontinued operating as a [[contract manufacturing organization]] in 1980 and instead chose to market their products under their own "Mylan-labeled" brand.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.thepharmaletter.com/company/mylan-laboratories|title=Mylan Laboratories|last=Letter|first=The Pharma|website=www.thepharmaletter.com|language=en|access-date=2018-04-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===1980s===
With the passage of the [[Drug Price Competition and Patent Term Restoration Act|Hatch-Waxman Act]] in 1984, Mylan and other small generic companies gained value; in the eighteen months following passage of the law Mylan's earnings grew 166% to $12.5 million and its stock value rose 800%.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Lewis|first1=Ralph A.|title=The Emerging Effects of the Drug Price Competition and Patent Term Restoration Act of 1984|journal=Journal of Contemporary Health Law &amp; Policy|date=1992|volume=8|issue=1|pages=361–378|url=http://scholarship.law.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1539&amp;context=jchlp}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Dyazide &amp; Maxzide====
In the 1980s one of the most prescribed drugs in the US was Dyazide, a [[diuretic]] that was a [[combination drug]] containing [[triamterene]] and [[hydrochlorothiazide]]; it had been on the market since 1965 and its patents had expired in 1980.&lt;ref name=Philly1987&gt;Ron Wolf for the Philadelphia Inquirer. August 22, 1987 [http://articles.philly.com/1987-08-22/news/26170137_1_smithkline-stock-smithkline-earnings-generic-version Smithkline Loses Exclusive Rights To Drug]&lt;/ref&gt;  Complications arose with the introductions of generics versions, because the formulation of Dyazide resulted in variable batches that made it impossible for generic manufacturers to show that their versions were bioequivalent.&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Boehm|first1=Garth|last2=Yao|first2=Lixin|last3=Han|first3=Liang|last4=Zheng|first4=Qiang|title=Development of the generic drug industry in the US after the Hatch-Waxman Act of 1984|journal=Acta Pharmaceutica Sinica B|date=September 2013|volume=3|issue=5|pages=297–311|doi=10.1016/j.apsb.2013.07.004|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2211383513000762}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=MylanHistDyazide&gt;John Seaman and John T.

Some generic companies committed fraud trying to bring a generic version of Dyazide.  Bolar Pharmaceutical had the first generic version approved in 1987,&lt;ref name=Philly1987/&gt;  but it turned out that Bolar had fraudulently substituted Dyazide for its own version to conduct studies that were submitted to the FDA. By 1989 the FDA rescinded its approval based on its suspicions and filed criminal charges against Bolar, to which Bolar eventually pled guilty in 1991.&lt;ref name=Siege/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Shaw|first1=Donna|title=U.s. Charges Bolar Pharmaceutical With Misrepresenting Its Products|url=http://articles.philly.com/1991-02-27/business/25775782_1_generic-drug-generic-drug-industry-bolar-pharmaceutical|work=Philadelphia Inquirer|date=February 27, 1991}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Freudenheim|first1=Milt|title=Bolar Plans Guilty Plea On Generics|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1991/02/28/business/bolar-plans-guilty-plea-on-generics.html|work=The New York Times|date=February 28, 1991}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Mylan chose to develop a new version of a triamterene/hydrochlorothiazide combination drug instead of going the generic route;  it developed a different, more stable formulation&lt;ref name=MylanHistDyazide/&gt; and used different dosages of each active ingredient (50&amp;nbsp;mg hydrochlorothiazide and 75&amp;nbsp;mg triamterene, compared with Dyazide's 25&amp;nbsp;mg hydrochlorothiazide and 50&amp;nbsp;mg triamterene).&lt;ref name=MaxApprovable/&gt; This drug had to get approval as a new drug, as opposed to a generic. Their product was called Maxzide and was approved in 1984.&lt;ref name=MaxApprovable&gt;Pink Sheet October 22, 1984 [https://pink.pharmamedtechbi.com/PS007364/MYLANs-MAXZIDE-IS-APPROVABLE-AT-FDA-LEDERLE-TO-MARKET-BRAND-COMPETITION-TO-SMITHKLINEs-No-3RANKED-DYAZIDE-FINAL-APPROVAL-ANTICIPATED-IMMINENTLY Mylan's Maxzide is "Approvable" at FDA: Lederle To Market Brand Competition to Smithkline's No. 3-Ranked Dyazide; Final Approval Anticipated "Imminently"]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;FDA [http://www.accessdata.fda.gov/scripts/cder/drugsatfda/index.cfm?fuseaction=Search.Set_Current_Drug&amp;ApplNo=019129&amp;DrugName=MAXZIDE&amp;ActiveIngred=HYDROCHLOROTHIAZIDE%3B%20TRIAMTERENE&amp;SponsorApplicant=MYLAN%20PHARMS%20INC&amp;ProductMktStatus=1&amp;goto=Search.Label_ApprovalHistory Approval History NDA 019129: Maxzide] Page accessed September 8, 2016&lt;/ref&gt;  The higher dose allowed once per day dosing, which Mylan and its marketing partner, Lederle, believed would help it compete against Dyazide, which had $210M in sales in 1983.&lt;ref name=MaxApprovable/&gt;  However, Mylan's patents on the drug were declared invalid in court, and its marketing exclusivity expired in 1987, prompting a rush of generic competition&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Reid|first1=Kenneth|title=US Judge to Rule on Drug Marketing|url=http://www.joc.com/us-judge-rule-drug-marketing_19871117.html|publisher=Journal of Commerce|date=November 17, 1987}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Mylan had concerns about the practices of its competitors and the FDA in general, and also with regard to companies seeking to bring generic versions of Maxzide.  Mylan hired private investigators to examine its competitors' practices, and when it found evidence of corruption, it submitted it to the [[United States House Energy Subcommittee on Oversight and Investigations|House Oversight and Investigations Committee]], which investigated and found fraud and corruption within the [[Food and Drug Administration]]'s generic drugs division and at other generic companies.&lt;ref name=NYTexpose1989&gt;{{Cite news|url = https://www.nytimes.com/1989/09/10/business/exposing-the-fda.html?pagewanted=all|title = Exposing the F.D.A.|last = Freudenheim|first = Milt|date = September 10, 1989|work = New York Times|accessdate = }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Two of the companies that had gotten approval to market generic versions of Maxzide,  Vitarine Pharmaceutical and [[Par Pharmaceutical]], were targets of Mylan's initial investigation and were found to have used Mylan's Maxzide to obtain their bioequivalence data, leading both companies to withdraw its generic competitor to Mylan's product.&lt;ref name=NYTexpose1989/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Andrews|first1=Edmund L.|title=F.D.A.

The corruption in the nascent generics industry and at the office in the FDA regulating it was widely covered in the media, and led to widespread concern among doctors and the public in the late 1980s and early 1990s that generic drugs were not really the same as the branded drugs they were meant to replace.&lt;ref name=Siege&gt;{{cite news|last1=Strickland|first1=Carol|title=Bolar: A Drug Company Under Siege|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1989/10/15/nyregion/bolar-a-drug-company-under-siege.html?pagewanted=all|work=The New York Times|date=October 15, 1989}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Cimons|first1=Marlene|title=FDA to Lift OK of Last Dyazide Generic Version|url=http://articles.latimes.com/1989-08-29/news/mn-1184_1_generic-drug|work=Los Angeles Times|date=August 29, 1989}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;

====Acquisitions begin====
In 1987 Mylan agreed to enter into a joint venture with Bolar to buy Somerset Pharmaceuticals; Mylan wanted access to Somersets' drug discovery capabilities as well as its new drug for Parkinson's, [[selegiline]]; the deal was completed in 1988 but its consummation was dependent on FDA approval of selegiline, which came in 1989.&lt;ref name=NYTexpose1989/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Bolar and Mylan Team to Purchase Somerset Labs|url=https://pink.pharmamedtechbi.com/PS014590/BOLAR-AND-MYLAN-TEAM-TO-PURCHASE-SOMERSET-LABS|work=Pink Sheet|date=November 14, 1988}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Somerset Eldepryl June 5 Approval Clears Way For Mylan/Bolar Acquisition|url=https://pink.pharmamedtechbi.com/PS015763/SOMERSET-ELDEPRYL-JUNE-5-APPROVAL-CLEARS-WAY-FOR-MYLANBOLAR-ACQUISITION|work=Pink Sheet|date=June 12, 1989}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===1990s===
Mylan acquired Bertek Inc. in 1993 for its [[transdermal patch]] technologies, and kept it as a subsidiary. In 1999 Mylan renamed the company Mylan Technologies Inc. (MTI).&lt;ref name="SpecialtyTrends2015"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Ku|first1=Mannching Sherry|title=Recent trends in specialty pharma business model|journal=Journal of Food and Drug Analysis|date=December 1, 2015|volume=23|issue=4|pages=595–608|doi=10.1016/j.jfda.2015.04.008|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1021949815000575}}&lt;/ref&gt;  MTI eventually came to be the contract manufacturer for the [[selegiline]] transdermal patch and was the first company to market  generic nitroglycerin, estradiol, clonidine, and fentanyl transdermal patches.&lt;ref name="SpecialtyTrends2015"/&gt;   

In 1996 Mylan acquired UDL Laboratories, a supplier of unit dose generic medications to institutional and [[long-term care]] facilities.&lt;ref&gt;Mylan [ftp://ftp.sec.gov/edgar/data/69499/0000069499-96-000033.txt Form 10-K (annual report))] for the Financial year ending March 31, 1996, filed June 26, 1996&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1998 when it was the world's second largest generics company, Mylan came under investigation from the [[Federal Trade Commission]] after it raised the prices of its products, tripling them in the case of [[lorazepam]].  Mylan had entered into an exclusive agreement with Profarmica, an Italian company that supplied drug ingredients, after which Mylan's competitors had higher prices and a diminished supply of raw ingredients for lorazepam and other drugs.&lt;ref name="NYT1998"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Labaton|first1=Stephen|title=A Drug Maker Is Said to Face A Suit on Prices|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1998/12/05/business/a-drug-maker-is-said-to-face-a-suit-on-prices.html|work=The New York Times|date=December 5, 1998}}&lt;/ref&gt; Before the round of price increases the price of generic drugs had been 5 - 10% of the price of branded drugs and afterwards it was around 50%.&lt;ref name="NYT1998"/&gt;  The FTC filed suit at the end of 1998 and 32 states filed parallel actions.  The case was settled in 2000, with Mylan paying a total of $147M --  $100M in disgorged profits into a fund to reimburse consumers and state agencies that had overpaid, $8 million in attorney's fees to the State Attorneys General, $35 million, plus $4 million in attorney's fees, to settle certain class actions with insurers and managed care organizations—and Mylan and three ingredient suppliers (Cambrex Corporation, Profarmaco S.R.L., and Gyma Laboratories) also agreed to an injunction barring them from entering into similar anticompetitive agreements in the future.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Press release: FTC Reaches Record Financial Settlement To Settle Charges of Price-fixing in Generic Drug Market {{!}} Federal Trade Commission|url=https://www.ftc.gov/news-events/press-releases/2000/11/ftc-reaches-record-financial-settlement-settle-charges-price|work=FTC|date=November 29, 2000}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = "nyt"&gt;

===2000s===
====Attempted King Pharmaceuticals acquisition====
In 2004 Mylan and [[King Pharmaceuticals]] began discussing a deal in which Mylan would acquire King for about $4B; Mylan wanted to expand its presence in branded pharmaceuticals and to acquire King's sales force.&lt;ref name="FortuneKing"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Creswell|first1=Julie|title=Icahn the Spoiler|url=http://archive.fortune.com/magazines/fortune/fortune_archive/2005/03/21/8254845/index.htm|work=Fortune|date=March 21, 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The deal was complicated by a number of factors, and included an SEC investigation into King's accounting and [[Carl Icahn]] obtaining a 9.8% interest in Mylan and becoming its largest stakeholder in order to kill the deal. The parties called off the deal in February 2005.&lt;ref name="FortuneKing"/&gt;  Afterwards, Icahn offered to buy Mylan for $5.4B&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Pollack|first1=Andrew|title=Icahn Offers $5.4 Billion for Mylan, Drug Maker|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2004/11/20/business/icahn-offers-54-billion-for-mylan-drug-maker.html|work=The New York Times|date=November 20, 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt; and nominated a slate of board members to change the direction of Mylan; he won three seats in May 2005.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=O'keefe|first1=Eric|title=Icahn Slate Wins Seats on Blockbuster Board|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2005/05/12/business/icahn-slate-wins-seats-on-blockbuster-board.html|work=The New York Times|date=May 12, 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In June Mylan bought back 25% of its shares in order to fend off Icahn.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Lazo|first1=Shirley A.|title=Survival Strategy|url=http://www.barrons.com/articles/SB111905080477763147|work=Barrons}}&lt;/ref&gt; In July Icahn gave up his bid and sold his shares.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Icahn Drops Bid for Mylan|url=http://articles.latimes.com/2005/jul/19/business/fi-mylan19|work=Los Angeles Times|agency=Bloomberg News|date=July 29, 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Matrix acquisition====
In August 2006 Mylan announced that it had reached an agreement to buy a controlling interest in Matrix Laboratories, an Indian supplier of [[active pharmaceutical ingredients]]. The deal gave Mylan access to markets in India and China and was completed in January the next year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Mylan Signs US$736-mil.

In 2009, the company filed two lawsuits against the [[Pittsburgh Post-Gazette]] after the newspaper ran an article that was critical of the quality control procedures used at the company's Morgantown plant.&lt;ref name="wsj2009"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Adams|first1=Russell|title=Mylan Again Sues Pittsburgh Post-Gazette|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424052748704746304574505972491633900|accessdate=August 26, 2016|publisher=[[Wall Street Journal]]|date=October 30, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ppg0709"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Sabatini|first1=Patricia|last2=Boselovic|first2=Len|title=Mylan workers overrode drug quality controls Internal report detailed 'pervasive' practice of ignoring safety procedures|url=http://www.post-gazette.com/business/businessnews/2009/07/26/Mylan-workers-overrode-drug-quality-controls/stories/200907260233|publisher=[[Pittsburgh Post-Gazette]]|accessdate=August 26, 2016|date=July 26, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; The company had earlier quality control issues involving the FDA.&lt;ref name="mwcbs09"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Edwards|first1=Jim|title=It's Not Mylan's First Quality Control Beef With FDA|url=http://www.cbsnews.com/news/its-not-mylans-first-quality-control-beef-with-fda/|accessdate=August 26, 2016|work=Money Watch|publisher=CBS News|date=July 28, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The lawsuits were dropped in 2012 without any damages paid by the Post-Gazette, which stated "The Post-Gazette did not find and did not intend to report that Mylan had manufactured or distributed any defective drugs.

Also in 2009, Mylan and its subsidiary UDL agreed to pay a $118M to settle a suit filed under the [[False Claims Act]] in which Mylan/UDL and two other companies were accused of underpaying states under the [[Medicaid Drug Rebate Program]]. The program requires drug companies to give rebates to states under Medicaid and the rebates are higher for new drugs than for generics; the suit said that the companies sold new drugs but paid rebates as if they were generics.&lt;ref&gt;US Department of Justice.

===2010s===
====Generic Advair agreement====
In 2011, Mylan entered into an agreement with [[Pfizer]] for the exclusive worldwide rights to develop, manufacture and commercialize Pfizer's generic equivalent to [[GlaxoSmithKline]]'s [[Advair]] (US)/Seretide (UK) Diskus incorporating Pfizer's proprietary dry powder inhaler delivery platform.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.drugstorenews.com/article/mylan-acquires-rights-pfizers-inhaler-technology|title=Mylan acquires rights to Pfizer's inhaler technology|work=drugstorenews.com|accessdate=May 1, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mylan launched the product in the UK in 2015&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Stanton|first1=Dan|title=GSK breathes freely as Mylan launches Seretide generic in UK|url=http://www.in-pharmatechnologist.com/Drug-Delivery/GSK-breathes-freely-as-Mylan-launches-Advair-generic-in-UK|work=in-Pharma Technologist|date=June 8, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; and in February 2016 the FDA accepted its ANDA, putting it in line behind Hikma and Sandoz to launch a generic version in the US.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Helfand|first1=Carly|title=Mylan joins the Advair-copycat queue, but approval could be a long slog|url=http://www.fiercepharma.com/sales-and-marketing/mylan-joins-advair-copycat-queue-but-approval-could-be-a-long-slog|work=FiercePharma|date=February 22, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====EpiPen4Schools Launch====
In 2012, Mylan launched a program called ''EpiPen4Schools'' to sell EpiPens in bulk and with discounts to schools. To participate in the program schools had to agree not to buy epinephrine autoinjectors from any other company for a year, a requirement which a Mylan spokesperson said is no longer part of its program.&lt;ref name=PBSschools&gt;{{cite news|last1=Swetlitz|first1=Ike|last2=Silverman|first2=Ed|title=Mylan may have violated antitrust law in its EpiPen sales to schools|url=https://www.pbs.org/newshour/rundown/mylan-may-violated-antitrust-law-epipen-sales-schools-legal-experts-say/|work=PBS Newshour|date=August 26, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In December 2012, the [[National Association of State Boards of Education]] launched a policy initiative designed to "help state boards of education as they develop student health policies regarding anaphylaxis and epinephrine auto-injector access and use," and advocated for state laws protecting school from legal liability for stocking and using epinephrine autoinjectors.  Gayle Manchin, the mother of Mylan's CEO, Heather Bresch, had become president of the association in 2010, and shortly after had discussed donations from her "daughter's company" to the association.  Manchin had been appointed to the West Virginia state school board by her husband, then-governor of the state [[Joe Manchin]], in 2007. In a statement, Mylan said, "There is no truth to the suggestion that the company's efforts were anything but straightforward or that we are aware of anyone advocating inappropriately for the right of schoolchildren to have access to potential life-saving medicine." &lt;ref name=USAtodayFamily&gt;{{cite news|last1=O'Donnell|first1=Jayne|title=Family matters:  EpiPens had high-level help getting into schools|url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2016/09/20/family-matters-epipens-had-help-getting-schools-manchin-bresch/90435218/|work=USA Today|date=September 21, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

After successful lobbying from Mylan,&lt;ref name=BloomMarketing/&gt; in 2013, the "School Access to Emergency Epinephrine Act" became law after passing Congress with broad and bipartisan support; it protected anyone from liability if they administered epinephrine to a child in a school (previously, only trained professionals or the affected person were allowed to administer the drug, and were open to liability), and it provided some financial incentives for schools that didn’t already stock epinephrine autoinjector to start stocking them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Novak|first1=Matt|title=How Congress, the FDA, and Sarah Jessica Parker Helped EpiPen Become a $1 Billion Business|url=https://gizmodo.com/how-congress-the-fda-and-sarah-jessica-parker-helped-1785568792|publisher=Gizmodo|date=August 23, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Joe Manchin, the father of Mylan's CEO, was a senator at that time.&lt;ref name=USAtodayFamily/&gt;

====Agila acquisition====
In 2013 Mylan acquired an Indian generic injectable drugs company, Agila Specialties Private, for $1.6 billion in cash.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Thomas|first1=Katie|title=Mylan Buys Drug Maker of Generic Injectables|url=https://dealbook.nytimes.com/2013/02/27/mylan-to-acquire-injectable-drug-maker-for-1-6-billion/?_r=0|publisher=New York Times|date=February 27, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In 2015 three plants acquired in that deal were issued warning letters by the FDA.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Palmer|first1=Eric|title=UPDATED: FDA castigates three Mylan sterile drug plants in warning letter |url=http://www.fiercepharma.com/regulatory/updated-fda-castigates-three-mylan-sterile-drug-plants-warning-letter|publisher=FiercePharma|date=August 18, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Abbott acquisition====
In July 2014, Mylan and [[Abbott Laboratories]] announced an agreement under which Mylan would buy Abbott's generic drugs business in developed markets for stock valued at about $5.3 billion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://abcnews.go.com/Business/wireStory/mylan-buy-abbott-business-line-53b-deal-24547698|title=Business News, Personal Finance and Money News - ABC News|author=ABC News|work=ABC News|accessdate=July 14, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mylan acquired Mumbai-based Famy Care and expand its presence in the market for women's contraceptives at about $750 million.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://articles.economictimes.indiatimes.com/2015-02-03/news/58751406_1_drugmaker-mylan-contraceptives-urban-indian-women|title=US drugmaker Mylan to acquire Famy Care for $750 Million|work=timesofindia-economictimes | date=February 3, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Attempted Perrigo acquisition====
In April 2015, Mylan tried negotiating with the management of [[Ireland|Irish]] pharmaceutical firm [[Perrigo]] to acquire the company, and when those negotiations failed Mylan attempted a hostile takeover, offering to buy $26B in shares directly from shareholders. Too few shareholders agreed to sell their stock by the deadline set in November 2015 and the effort failed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Koons|first1=Cynthia|title=Mylan's Hostile Bid for Perrigo Fails|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2015-11-13/mylan-s-hostile-bid-for-perrigo-fails-as-40-of-shares-tendered|work=Bloomberg|date=November 13, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Attempted purchase by Teva====
Two weeks after Mylan made its first offer for Perrigo, [[Teva Pharmaceutical]] offered to buy Mylan for $40B; the combined companies would have been the world's largest generic company and the 9th biggest drug company in the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Rockoff|first1=Jonathan D.|last2=Mattioli|first2=Dana|title=Teva Offers to Buy Mylan for $40 Billion|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/teva-offers-to-buy-mylan-for-82-a-share-1429620984|work=Wall Street Journal|date=April 22, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In July, Teva dropped its bid for Mylan and instead acquired [[Allergan]]'s generic drug business for about the same price.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/videos/2015-07-27/teva-to-buy-allergan-s-generic-drug-unit|title=Teva to Buy Allergan's Generic Drug Unit|date=July 27, 2015|work=Bloomberg.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2015-07-27/teva-snaps-up-allergan-s-generics-arm-dumping-mylan|title=Teva Snaps Up Allergan's Generics Arm, Dumping Mylan|author=Chitra Somayaji|date=July 27, 2015|work=Bloomberg.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====New COPD drug====
In June 2015, Mylan agreed to work with Pulmatrix, a company with a proprietary inhaled drug delivery platform, to co-develop a product to treat for [[chronic obstructive pulmonary disease]]; the product was PUR0200, a generic drug in a Pulmatrix device.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.genengnews.com/gen-news-highlights/mylan-to-co-develop-pulmatrix-copd-candidate/81251395/|title=Mylan to Co-Develop Pulmatrix' COPD Candidate|work=GEN}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Meda acquisition====
In February 2016, the company announced it would acquire [[Meda AB|Meda]] for $9.9 billion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.genengnews.com/gen-news-highlights/mylan-to-acquire-meda-for-9-9b/81252356/|title=Mylan to Acquire Meda for $9.9B - GEN News Highlights - GEN|publisher=|accessdate=August 25, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In May of the same year the company announced it would acquire Renaissance Acquisition Holdings dermatology division for up to $1 billion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fiercepharma.com/pharma/mylan-snaps-up-dermatology-biz-from-investors-1b-deal|title=Mylan snaps up dermatology biz from investors in $1B deal  - FiercePharma|publisher=|accessdate=August 25, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In December 2016, the [[State attorney general|attorneys general]] of 20 states filed a civil complaint accusing Mylan of a coordinated scheme to artificially maintain high prices for a generic antibiotic and diabetes drug. The complaint alleged [[Price fixing|price collusion schemes]] between six pharmaceutical firms including informal gatherings, telephone calls, and text messages.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Thomas |first=Katie |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2016/12/15/business/generic-drug-price-lawsuit-teva-mylan.html |title=20 States Accuse Generic Drug Companies of Price Fixing |work=[[The New York Times]] |date=2016-12-15 |accessdate=2016-12-16 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In October 2017, the company announced the launch of the first FDA-approved generic of Teva’s long-acting Copaxone. Approximately 3 months later, Credit Suisse analyst Vamil Divan cited IMS Health data which showed that the new generic accounted for 10% of the market.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Helfand |first1=Carly |title=Look out, Teva: Mylan's Copaxone copy has already captured serious share |url=https://www.fiercepharma.com/marketing/look-out-teva-mylan-s-copaxone-copy-has-already-captured-serious-share |accessdate=9 July 2018 |publisher=FiercePharma |date=4 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In May 2018, Mylan announced a collaboration with West Virginia University to expose children across West Virginia to STEM educational initiatives.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.wboy.com/news/business/mylan-and-wvu-announce-10-year-collaboration/1178903614|title=Mylan and WVU announce 10 year collaboration|last=Hudock|first=Megan|date=2018-05-14|work=WBOY|access-date=2018-06-11|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===EpiPen pricing===
{{see also|Epinephrine autoinjector#Price}}
{{see also|Heather Bresch#Mylan executive}}
Mylan acquired the right to market and distribute the EpiPen line of [[epinephrine autoinjector]] devices from Merck KGaA as part of their 2007 deal;&lt;ref name=NYT2016&gt;Tara Parker-Pope and Rachel Rabkin Peachman for the New York Times.  August 22, 2016 [http://well.blogs.nytimes.com/2016/08/22/epipen-price-rise-sparks-concern-for-allergy-sufferers/?_r=1 EpiPen Price Rise Sparks Concern for Allergy Sufferers]&lt;/ref&gt; that right had formerly been held by Dey LP, a wholly owned subsidiary of Merck.&lt;ref&gt;King Pharmaceuticals October 21, 2002. [http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/king-pharmaceuticals-to-acquire-meridian-medical-technologies-76364227.html Press Release: King Pharmaceuticals to Acquire Meridian Medical Technologies]&lt;/ref&gt; According to Bloomberg the devices deliver about $1 worth of drug.&lt;ref name=BloomMarketing&gt;Cynthia Koons and Robert Langreth for Bloomberg Businessweek. September 23, 2015 [https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2015-09-23/how-marketing-turned-the-epipen-into-a-billion-dollar-business How Marketing Turned the EpiPen Into a Billion-Dollar Business]&lt;/ref&gt; At that time annual sales were around $200M.&lt;ref name=BloomMarketing/&gt;  Bresch, the company's CEO, saw an opportunity to increase sales through marketing and advocacy, and the company launched a marketing campaign to increase awareness of the dangers of [[anaphylaxis]] for people with severe allergies that made the brand "EpiPen" as identified with its product as "Kleenex" is with facial tissue. The company also successfully lobbied the FDA to broaden the label to include risk of anaphylaxis and in parallel, successfully lobbied Congress to generate legislation making EpiPens available in schools and in public places like [[Automated external defibrillator|defibrillators]] are, and hired the same people that [[Medtronic]] had worked with on defibrillator legislation to do so.&lt;ref name=BloomMarketing/&gt;  Mylan's efforts to gain market dominance were aided when [[Sanofi]]'s competing product was recalled in November 2015 and further when Teva's generic competitor was rejected by the FDA in March 2016.&lt;ref&gt;Carly Helfand for FiercePharma March 1, 2016 [http://www.fiercepharma.com/sales-and-marketing/fda-swats-down-teva-s-epipen-copy-putting-mylan-cruise-control FDA swats down Teva's EpiPen copy, putting Mylan in cruise control]&lt;/ref&gt;

By the first half of 2015, Mylan had an 85% market share of such devices in the US&lt;ref name=BloomMarketing/&gt; and in that year sales reached around $1.5B and accounted for 40% of Mylan's profit.&lt;ref name=ForbesCould&gt;Emily Willingham  for Forbes.

Because They Could]&lt;/ref&gt;  Those profits were also due in part to Mylan's continually raising the price of EpiPens starting in 2009; in 2009 the wholesale price of two EpiPens was about $100, by July 2013 the price was about $265, in May 2015 it was around $461, and in May 2016 the price rose again to around $609,&lt;ref name=NYT2016/&gt; around a 500% jump from the price in 2009.&lt;ref name="Baltimore"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://baltimore.cbslocal.com/2016/08/18/cost-jumps-nearly-500-percent-for-life-saving-epipens/|title=Cost Jumps Nearly 500-Percent For Life-Saving EpiPens|last=Bartolotta|first=Devin|date=August 18, 2016|website=|publisher=CBS Baltimore|access-date=August 19, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;  

Starting in 2014, according to a 2017 report in the ''New York Times'', mid-level executives began questioning the rate at which the company had increased and was planning to continue to increase the price of the Epi-Pen, and raising concerns that the price increases were unethical; the ''Times'' reported that when these concerns were brought to Robert Coury, the chairman of the board, Coury "replied that he was untroubled. He raised both his middle fingers and explained, using colorful language, that anyone criticizing Mylan, including its employees, ought to go copulate with themselves.

In the summer of 2016, as parents prepared to send their children back to school and went to pharmacies to get new EpiPens, people began to express outrage at the cost of the EpiPen and Mylan was widely and harshly criticized, &lt;ref name="Gold2016"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.kpbs.org/news/2016/feb/18/food-allergies-life-saving-drug-too-expensive/|title=People With Food Allergies Say Life-Saving Drug Too Expensive|last1=Goldberg|first1=Kenny|website=KPBS Public Media|accessdate=June 8, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/mylan-to-launch-cheaper-generic-epipen-alternative-1472467730|title=Mylan to Launch Cheaper Generic EpiPen Alternative|last1=Walker|first1=Joseph|date=August 30, 2016|work=Wall Street Journal|last2=Winslow|first2=Ron|last3=Steele|first3=Anne}}&lt;/ref&gt; including criticism from [[Martin Shkreli]], "poster boy for grasping pharma greed," letters from two Senators and initiation of Congressional investigations.&lt;ref name="ForbesCould" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Emma Court for MarketWatch.

According to the Department of Health and Human Services' Office of Inspector General analysis, the U.S. government may have overpaid "as much as $1.27 billion between 2006 and 2016" to drugmaker Mylan N.V. for the EpiPen emergency allergy treatment. This represents three times the proposed settlement of $465 million announced by Mylan in October 2016. In October 2016, Mylan announced a settlement with the [[US Department of Justice]] over rebates paid by Mylan to states under the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program.&lt;ref name=NYToctRebate&gt;{{cite news|last1=Thomas|first1=Katie|title=Mylan to Settle EpiPen Overpricing Case for $465 Million|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2016/10/08/business/epipen-mylan-justice-department-settlement.html?ref=topics&amp;_r=0|work=The New York Times|date=October 7, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Questions had been raised by Congress and others about why EpiPen had been classified as a generic rather a proprietary product in the program since 1997; generic drugs have lower rebates (13%) than proprietary drugs (23%), and price hikes for generic drugs cannot be passed onto states, and a common form of [[pharmaceutical fraud]] involves misclassifying proprietary drugs as generic under the program.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Thomas|first1=Katie|title=Is EpiPen a Brand-Name or a Generic Drug?

===Execution drugs===

Mylan manufactures [[rocuronium bromide]], which is approved by the state of [[Alabama]] for use in executions by [[lethal injection]]. European manufacturers refuse to sell drugs which can be used for executions to the United States, except to distributors or users who sign legally binding agreements that the drug will not be used for executions down the delivery chain.&lt;ref name="execution"&gt;{{cite journal

In September 2014, the [[London]]-based [[human rights]] organization [[Reprieve (organisation)|Reprieve]] told Mylan that they were the only [[FDA]]-approved manufacturer of [[rocuronium bromide]] without legal controls in place to prevent its use in executions, and there was "a very real risk that Mylan may soon become the go-to provider of execution drugs for states across the country". The German asset manager {{Interlanguage link multi|DJE Kapital|de}} [[divested]] itself of $70 million in Mylan shares for that reason. Mylan said that their distribution was "legally compliant," &lt;ref name="execution"/&gt; and that their restrictions did "prohibit resale to correctional facilities for use in lethal injections." &lt;ref name="Newsroom: Mylan Statement on its Policy Against the Use of Mylan Products in Capital Punishment"&gt;{{cite web |title=Mylan Statement on its Policy Against the Use of Mylan Products in Capital Punishment |url=http://newsroom.mylan.com/press-releases?item=123361 |publisher=Mylan |accessdate=25 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Negotiated cartelism''' (sometimes called a [[bilateral monopoly]] by [[economist]]s) is a labor arrangement that holds labor prices above the [[market clearing]] level through union leverage over employers. The phrase was coined by Peter Swenson,&lt;ref&gt;http://politicalscience.yale.edu/people/peter-swenson&lt;/ref&gt; an economics professor at [[Yale university]].

Labor finds this desirable because it can point to the increased wages it offers as signs of its achievement, and labor receives more money. [[capitalism|Capitalists]] may find this desirable because there are "worse alternatives," i.e., strikes, workplace disruptions, etc. Furthermore, it acts as a barrier to entry against upstart firms. If all firms are required to pay higher than normal wages, it is difficult to compete on price, and an employer can take out an undercutting competitor by encouraging strikes.

In areas where the cartelists wage is higher than other local employers using the same labor pool, they have the advantage of being able to cherry pick the best workers and can often expect extra effort from their employees.

This arrangement would appear to be to the detriment of consumers, but it doesn't actually eliminate price competition. It simply removes wages as a factor, which makes employers seek new and more entrepreneurial methods of cost saving.&lt;ref name="Swenson2002"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Swenson|first1=Peter A.|title=Solidarity, Segmentation, and Market Control|year=2002|pages=11|doi=10.1093/0195142977.003.0002}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Examples==
The [[National Civic Federation]], an American economic organization founded in 1900 in an attempt to ameliorate labor disputes, is an example of negotiated cartelism in action. Their 'Industrial Arbritation Department' helped to promote collective bargaining on a multi-employer basis - thus bringing wages above the market clearing level in areas such as brewing, entertainment, boiler making, trucking and clothing.&lt;ref name="Swenson2002_2"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Swenson|first1=Peter A.|title=Cartelism and Market Control|year=2002|pages=12|doi=10.1093/0195142977.003.0007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Founded in 1976, the '''Pensions Management Institute''' (PMI) is the UK's largest and most recognisable professional body for employee benefits and retirement savings professionals, supporting over 6,500 members in 32 countries.

The purpose of the Institute is "To set and promote standards of excellence and lifelong learning for employee benefits and retirement savings professionals and trustees through qualifications, membership and ongoing support services."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.pensions-pmi.org.uk/about-us/|title=About Us|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

PMI's members, represented in 8 regions, are responsible for managing and advising some of the largest institutions in the world, accounting for £1trillion invested in pensions.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.pensions-pmi.org.uk/home/|title=Pensions Management Institute|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

The PMI was formed in June 1976 by four bodies: The National Association of Pension Funds (NAPF) - now the [[Pensions and Lifetime Savings Association]] , the Society of Pension Consultants (SPC) - now the Society of Pension Professionals, the Association of Consulting Actuaries (ACA) and the Life Insurance Council of the [[Association of British Insurers]] (ABI.)

These organisations felt that there should be a professional institute dedicated to setting educational standards and qualifications for those advising upon and managing UK pension schemes. Each of those bodies contributed four senior people to sit on the first PMI council.

The PMI (in conjunction with the [[Chartered Insurance Institute]]) held its initial examinations in 1978.

In September 2015, Chief Executive Vince Linnane announced that he would be stepping down after more than thirty years with the PMI, and over ten years in the CEO role.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Professional Pensions|title=Vince Linnane 32 years at the PMI|url=http://www.professionalpensions.com/professional-pensions/interview/2451416/vince-linnane-32-years-at-the-pmi}}&lt;/ref&gt; Gareth Tancred was announced as the new CEO in February 2016.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Professional Pensions|title=Gareth Tancred|url=http://professionalpensions.stage.incisive.pro.pugpig.com/2016/04/27/gareth-tancred-developing-the-pmi/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Peter Adalbert Robert George Fritz''' [[Order of Australia|AM]] (born 4 January 1943)&lt;ref&gt;Who's Who in Business in Australia, January – June 2005, 
Volume I – Biographies, Page 261&lt;/ref&gt; is an Australian businessman and philanthropist.  He was born in [[Arad, Romania]] and migrated to Australia in 1962.  He has been Group Managing Director of the TCG Group of Companies since 1971 and Chairman of institute for active policy Global Access Partners&lt;ref&gt;http://www.globalaccesspartners.org/contact.html&lt;/ref&gt; since 1997.
  
Peter is a co-founder of well over 100 companies and several business accelerators. TCG® is a group of innovative businesses which over the last 46 years have been at the forefront of Australian innovation. They produced many breakthrough discoveries in computer and communication technologies, data transmission, management structures and the food industry, including VOIP telephony (1998); design and manufacturing of plastic note sorting machines (1995); lottery ticket validation terminal (1988); mirror microwave communication technology and CT3 technology, first in the world (1986); BOW Memory unit for cash registers (1985); credit card validation system (pioneer technology in secure transmission) and MOX memory unit for building security (1984); low-cost fossil fuel power station simulator (1983); the first echo-free, hands-free telephone handset (1978); and online stock control system - the first real-time system in commercial use (1972).

Peter established and chaired the National Incubator Companies Board (ATP) between 1992 and 1997 and co-founded the Joint Technology Partners incubator – a significant investor in Australian technology start-ups.

In 1993, some of the 65 companies in the TCG Group were publicly floated on the Australian Stock Exchange as TechComm Group Limited, later renamed Utility Computer Services ([[UXC]]). In 2016, UXC was acquired by CSC for $430 million. Another former TCG company floated on the New York Stock Exchange in November 1997 for US$600m (AU$1 billion), making it the largest technology company to be established in Australia until that time. Today the TCG companies, and entities with TCG roots, employ well over 6000 people with a turnover in excess of $1.5 billion annually.

Peter's innovative management style and corporate structuring has led to the creation of a business model which is being copied by many successful entrepreneurs, and has become part of university undergraduate and masters programs in business management in Australia and around the world.

Peter holds six degrees or professional qualifications, is an adjunct professor at the [[University of Technology Sydney]] and an honorary member  of the Hungarian Academy of Engineering 1998. He is a fellow of the Australian Computer Society, the Institute of Engineers Australia, and the Australian Society of Accountants.  His many awards include The [[Order of Australia]] in 1993 and the UTS Alumni Award for Excellence 2010.  His books include 'The Possible Dream' (Penguin 1988),&lt;ref&gt;http://catalogue.nla.gov.au/Record/2080318&lt;/ref&gt; 'Beyond "Yes"' (Harper Collins 1998),&lt;ref&gt;http://catalogue.nla.gov.au/Record/3291620&lt;/ref&gt; "The Profit Principle" co-authored by  Jeanne-Vida Douglas (John Wiley and Sons 2010)&lt;ref&gt;http://catalogue.nla.gov.au/Record/4925431&lt;/ref&gt; and "Managing for Change" co-authored by Brad Howarth (TCG Publications 2014).&lt;ref&gt;https://catalogue.nla.gov.au/Record/6541219&lt;/ref&gt;

Peter chairs the Australian Government Consultative Committee on Knowledge Capital&lt;ref&gt;http://www.theage.com.au/news/Management-Focus/Accounting-for-the-uncountable/2005/02/14/1108229910079.html&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.finance.gov.au/publications/annual-reports/annualreport04-05/chapter06_05.html&lt;/ref&gt; and serves on a number of private enterprise boards.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.nblf.com.au/about-nblf/forum-steering-committee/&lt;/ref&gt; He represented Australia on the [[OECD]] Small Medium Size Enterprise committee and in other OECD forums.&lt;ref&gt;http://webcache.googleusercontent.com/search?q=cache:kYLqigUA60UJ:www.insme.org/documenti/mm-Malmo-Final-25-Feb-04.ppt+OECD+peter+fritz&amp;cd=8&amp;hl=en&amp;ct=clnk&amp;gl=au&amp;client=firefox-a&lt;/ref&gt;

Peter Fritz is a Member of the Board of the Global Panel Foundation - Australasia - a respected non-government organisation (with offices and satellites in Berlin, Copenhagen, New York, Prague, Sydney and Toronto) that works behind the scenes in crisis areas around the world. The current Australasia Chair is the Rt. Hon. Don McKinnon, former Deputy Prime Minister of New Zealand and Commonwealth Secretary General, and the Vice Chair is Hon. Philip Ruddock.

Peter co-chaired the government-commissioned Working Group on Education and Training in Philanthropy and Social Investment (2007–2008) which led to the establishment of the Centre for Social Impact (CSI) in 2008, a national centre for philanthropy and social investment, with an Australian Government endowment of $12.4 million.&lt;ref&gt;Swinburne University of Technology, Faculty of Business and Enterprise Annual Report 2007, http://www.swinburne.edu.au/business/documents/faculty/FBEAnnualReport2007.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; The CSI is a joint collaboration between the business schools of the [[University of New South Wales]], [[Melbourne Business School]], [[Swinburne University of Technology]] and the [[University of Western Australia]] and provides managerial education, executive support and research for the not-for-profit sector.

Peter was instrumental in the establishment of the OECD Working Group on SMEs (1993), Society for Knowledge Economics (2005), Australian Society for Progress and Wellbeing (2014), National Small Business Centre (1992), International Institute for Negotiation and Conflict Management (1996), and many others.

Peter is a regular blogger on the issues of [[innovation]] and [[entrepreneurship]] on [[Open Forum (Australia)]].[15] He is currently collaborating with privacy expert Malcolm Crompton and author Brad Howarth on a new book “A Vision for an Innovative Australia” based on interviews with eminent Australian and international thought leaders. The book explores what Australia’s core competencies are and is relevant for any government long-term planning.

'''''Pizza Tycoon''''' (known as '''''Pizza Connection''''' in Europe) is a [[business simulation game|business simulation video game]]. The game was designed by the German company Cybernetic Corporation&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.welt.de/spiele/gallery120615650/Das-sind-die-besten-deutschen-Computerspiele.html Das sind die besten deutschen Computerspiele] on [[welt.de]] "1994: Pizza Connection" (in German)&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Software 2000]] in 1994,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.eurogamer.de/articles/2017-01-05-pizza-connection-1-und-2-auf-gog-com-erhaeltlich pizza-connection-1-und-2-auf-gog-com-erhaeltlich] on [[Eurogamer]] by Benjamin Jakobs (05/01/2017)&lt;/ref&gt; and was published by Assemble Entertainment after its re-release in 2017. It was published and adapted for the American market by [[MicroProse]] with changed artwork and locations.

== Gameplay ==
The game is centered on being the manager of a [[pizza]] [[restaurant]] in a town in [[Europe]] or the [[United States|U.S.]]. It gives the player the option to choose among more than thirty different characters, to create one's own pizza, have cooking contests and modify the display of the restaurant and kitchen. The player can call upon local [[mafia]] to sabotage competitor restaurants or get money from criminal activities such as weapon and [[drug deal]]ing.

The game displays a playful sense of humor from the graphics and cartoonish drawings, game messages, and animated faces that are put on interacting characters. The original European version ("Pizza Connection") featured a graphical style very similar to [[MAD magazine|MAD]] artist [[Don Martin (cartoonist)|Don Martin]].&lt;ref name="greer"/&gt; Microprose's adapted version ("Pizza Tycoon") for the American market distanced itself from this style due to copyright concerns with newly created characters in a different style modeled after famous people as [[Richard Nixon]], [[Ronald Reagan]] or [[Vladimir Lenin|Lenin]].&lt;ref name="greer"&gt;[http://www.terrygreer.com/microprosemisc.html ''Terry Greer's Microprose Misc graphics page'' Page] the Microprose artist who worked on the conversion from the original German game.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legacy==
''Pizza Tycoon'' was followed by ''Pizza Tycoon 2'', developed by [[Software 2000]].

Both games were released on [[GOG.com]] in January 2017.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.destructoid.com/the-delightfully-odd-pizza-tycoon-is-now-on-gog-com-409984.phtml the-delightfully-odd-pizza-tycoon-is-now-on-gog-com] on [[Destructoid]] by Jordan Devore (2017-01-05)&lt;/ref&gt;

== Reception ==
The [[Amiga Joker]] 2/94 magazine gave ''Pizza Connection'' 88 of 100%,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.kultboy.com/index.php?site=t&amp;id=12291&amp;s=2 Pizza Connection review] on Amiga Joker (1994)&lt;/ref&gt; Powerplay magazin rated the Amiga version 82 of 100%.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.kultpower.de/powerplay_testbericht_extern.php3?im=pizzaconnection.jpg Pizza connection] on PowerPlay (1994)&lt;/ref&gt;

''[[Next Generation (magazine)|Next Generation]]'' reviewed the PC version of the game, rating it four stars out of five, and stated that "Not a game for die hard action fans, but a winner for just about everyone else."&lt;ref name="NG"&gt;{{cite magazine|last=|first=|title=Finals|magazine=[[Next Generation (magazine)|Next Generation]]|issue=6|publisher=[[Future US|Imagine Media]]|date=June 1995|page=107}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Refimprove|date=September 2014}}

'''Polishing''' is the process of creating a smooth and shiny surface by rubbing it or using a chemical action, leaving a surface with a significant [[specular reflection]] (still limited by the [[index of refraction]] of the material according to the [[Fresnel equations]].)&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|title=Polish|url=http://www.answers.com/polishing|accessdate=2008-01-04}}. {{Dead link|date=July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; In some materials (such as metals, glasses, black or transparent stones), polishing  is also able to reduce [[diffuse reflection]] to minimal values. When an unpolished surface is  magnified thousands of times, it usually looks like mountains and valleys. By repeated abrasion, those "mountains" are worn down until they are flat or just small "hills." The process of polishing with [[abrasive]]s starts with coarse ones and graduates to fine ones.

==Mechanical properties==
The strength of polished products is normally higher than their rougher counterpart owing to the removal of [[stress concentration]]s present in the rough surface. They take the form of corners and other defects which magnify the local stress beyond the inherent strength of the material. 

Polishing with very fine abrasive differs physically from coarser abrasion, in that material is removed on a molecular level, so that the rate is correlated to the boiling point rather than to the melting point of the material being polished.{{Citation needed|reason=Correlation to melting and boiling points are disputed in the literature.|date=November 2013}}

'''Sergei Nikolayevich Gorkov''' (also [[Romanization of Russian|tr.]] '''Sergey'''; {{lang-ru|Серге́й Никола́евич Горько́в}}; born 1 December 1968) is a Russian banker and attorney. Currently, he serves as chairman of [[Vnesheconombank]] (VEB), a major Russian state-owned bank. Previously, between 2010 and 2016, he was the deputy chairman of [[Sberbank]], Russia's largest bank.&lt;ref name="nytimes317"&gt;{{cite news | last1 = Becker | first1 = Jo | last2 = Rosenberg | first2 =  Matthew | last3 = Haberman | first3 = Maggie | author-link1=Jo Becker | author-link2=Matthew Rosenberg  | author-link3=Maggie Haberman | title = Senate Committee to Question Jared Kushner Over Meetings With Russians | url = https://www.nytimes.com/2017/03/27/us/politics/senate-jared-kushner-russia.html | newspaper = [[The New York Times]] | date = 27 March 2017 | accessdate =25 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He is a graduate of the [[FSB Academy|Academy of the Federal Counter-Intelligence Service]], which prepares members for the [[Foreign Intelligence Service (Russia)|Foreign Intelligence Service]] and [[Federal Security Service]] (FSB), and holds a master's degree in economics.

==Early life and education==
Gorkov was born in [[Gai, Orenburg Oblast]], [[Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic|Soviet Russia]], in 1968, to Nikolai Gorkov and Lyubov Gorkova. He has an older brother, Alexei Gorkov (born 1963), who joined the VEB board of directors in January 2017, and a younger sister, Antonina Konoplya (born 1971).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Брат главы ВЭБа Сергея Горькова войдет в состав совета директоров ВЭБ-Лизинга|url=https://news.rambler.ru/politics/35877942-brat-glavy-veba-sergeya-gorkova-voydet-v-sostav-soveta-direktorov-veb-lizinga/|accessdate=26 May 2017|work=Rambler News|date=20 January 2017|language=ru-RU}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1994, Sergei graduated with  a law degree from the [[FSB Academy|Academy of the Federal Counter-Intelligence Service]], which prepares members for the [[Foreign Intelligence Service (Russia)|Foreign Intelligence Service]] and [[Federal Security Service]] (FSB). In 2002, he earned a master's degree in economics at the [[Plekhanov Russian University of Economics]].&lt;ref name="vebbio"&gt;{{cite news|title=About:  Chairman|url=http://www.veb.ru/about/today/#chairman|accessdate=25 May 2017|work=www.veb.ru|publisher=[[Vnesheconombank]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; He speaks English and Arabic.&lt;ref name="oren"&gt;{{cite news|title=Горьков Сергей Николаевич — председатель Внешэкономбанка|url=http://orenpolit.ru/persons/item/1428-gorkov-sergej-nikolaevich-predsedatel-vneshekonombanka|accessdate=30 May 2017|work=Orenburgskaya Politika}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career==
===Early career and Yukos===
[[File:Putin and Gorkov February 2017.jpg|thumb|left|250px|[[Vladimir Putin]] and Gorkov meet at the Kremlin, February 2017]]
Gorkov later worked with [[Bank Menatep]] (1994–1997) before joining the [[Yukos]] oil company and Yukos Moscow (1997–2005), all of which are now defunct. He was a vice president at Yukos, where he oversaw personnel and pensions. He was also engaged in a social outreach program, Yukos' own youth movement called "New Civilization" ({{lang-ru|«Новая Цивилизация»}}). The movement, which was extremely costly, had a mission to change Russia, and involved summer camps and young people engaging in the political system with their own party and parliament.&lt;ref name="forbes217"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Rudenko|first1=Pyotr|title="У него все хорошо при нынешнем режиме": кто такой Сергей Горьков|url=http://www.forbes.ru/finansy/igroki/313415-u-nego-vse-khorosho-pri-nyneshnem-rezhime-kto-takoi-sergei-gorkov|accessdate=25 May 2017|work=[[Forbes|Forbes Russia]]|date=26 February 2017|language=ru}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2003, Yukos began to collapse under a massive tax scandal amid [[Yukos shareholders vs. Russia|lawsuits against the Russian government]]. ''[[Forbes]]'' stated it was a large mystery how Gorkov managed to avoid arrest, but inside sources (including [[Pavel Ivlev]]) stated it was through his connections with the Kremlin and the [[Federal Security Service|FSB]].&lt;ref name="guardian6317"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Luhn|first1=Alec|title=Who is Sergei Gorkov, the powerful Russian banker who met Jared Kushner?|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/jun/03/sergei-gorkov-russian-banker-jared-kushner|accessdate=3 June 2017|work=[[The Guardian]]|date=3 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Yukos CEO [[Mikhail Khodorkovsky]], an enemy of Russian leader [[Vladimir Putin]], was imprisoned for eight years for fraud and tax evasion, a conviction that drew skepticism in the West. Gorkov's subordinate, Alexei Kurtsin, was sentenced to 15 years in prison for embezzlement and served eight.&lt;ref name="forbes217"/&gt;&lt;ref name="newsweek"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Sharkov|first1=Damien|title=Who is Sergey Gorkov, the Russian banker Jared Kushner allegedly met?|url=http://www.newsweek.com/sergey-gorkov-grad-russian-banker-kushner-617422|accessdate=31 May 2017|work=[[Newsweek]]|date=30 May 2017|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2005, after the Yukos fiasco, Gorkov moved to [[London]], where he worked with several companies. He sat on the board of directors for Eton Energy Ltd. and for liquor company New Muscovy Company Ltd. Gorkov returned to Russia in 2006.&lt;ref name="forbes217"/&gt; From 2005 to 2008, he sat on the board of directors of [[FESCO Transport Group]], Russia's largest intermodal transport operator.&lt;ref name="oren"/&gt;

===Sberbank===
Gorkov moved into the banking sector in November 2008, when he joined the state-owned [[Sberbank of Russia|Sberbank]] as director of personnel. During the recession, Gorkov oversaw an overhaul of the workforce, reducing the number of employees from 270,000 to 240,000 to increase efficiency and profit.&lt;ref name="kommersantbio"&gt;{{cite news|title=Горьков Сергей Николаевич|url=http://www.kommersant.ru/doc/2925502|accessdate=31 May 2017|work=Kommersant|date=26 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; He also led a retraining program, with 200,000 of the employees receiving some form of retraining, and introduced an employee evaluation system that led to monthly bonuses for the best employees.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Chaikina|first1=Yulia|title=Сбербанк: реформ невпроворот|url=http://www.forbes.ru/karera/menedzhment/53487-sberbank-reform-nevprovorot|accessdate=31 May 2017|work=[[Forbes]]|date=27 July 2010|language=ru}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Gorkov was tremendously successful during his first five years at Sberbank; Gorkov was appointed deputy chairman of the board of Sberbank in October 2010. He was promoted to run its international operations division and helped it expand its business reach from two countries to 20.&lt;ref name="vebbio"/&gt;&lt;ref name="forbes217"/&gt; Its international expansion included acquisitions of Volksbank of Austria and [[DenizBank]] of Turkey. Starting in October 2012, Gorkov was chairman of Sberbank's division in [[Kazakhstan]].&lt;ref name="oren"/&gt;

===VEB===
In February 2016, Russian President [[Vladimir Putin]] promoted Gorkov to chairman of [[Vnesheconombank]] (VEB), succeeding [[Vladimir Dmitriev]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Путин назначил Сергея Горькова главой ВЭБ|url=http://tass.ru/ekonomika/2697259|accessdate=25 May 2017|work=ТАСС|date=26 February 2017|language=ru}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Russian sources, Gorkov's connection to the FSB played a part in his appointment to lead VEB; Putin, the former director of the FSB, has appointed several of its members to important roles in Russian government.&lt;ref name="newsweek"/&gt; Founded in 1922, Vnesheconombank is one of the oldest banks in Russia, but was acquired as a state development bank in 2007. During the [[Financial crisis of 2007–2008|financial crisis of 2007–08]], Vnesheconombank's status as a state-owned bank forced it to assist the government with the domestic economy. It reorganized struggling banks, purchased two steel companies, bought 175 billion rubles (approximately $3 billion) of sagging shares of Russian companies to keep them afloat, and also heavily invested in struggling [[Banking in Ukraine|Ukrainian banks]].&lt;ref name="rbc"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Tkachev|first1=Ivan|last2=Polyakova|first2=Yulia|title=Проблема в $20 млрд: как Банк развития превратился в черную дыру|url=http://www.rbc.ru/finances/18/02/2016/56c4a49a9a79475ba1d428f9|accessdate=30 May 2017|publisher=RBC|date=18 February 2016|language=ru}}&lt;/ref&gt;

VEB, which has been dubbed Vladimir Putin's "pet bank" and "slush fund" by Western observers, also lent significantly for the [[2014 Winter Olympics]] in [[Sochi]], covertly funded pro-Russian groups in Ukraine, and has frequently bailed out [[Russian oligarch]]s close to Putin.&lt;ref name="nytimes529"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Mazzetti|first1=Matthew|last2=Rosenberg|first2=Mark|last3=Haberman|first3=Maggie|title=Investigation Turns to Kushner’s Motives in Meeting With a Putin Ally|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2017/05/29/us/politics/jared-kushner-russia-investigation.html|accessdate=30 May 2017|work=The New York Times|date=29 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to ''[[Foreign Policy]]''{{'}}s assessment, VEB "functions as an off-the-books kitty that allows President Vladimir Putin to reward his allies and shower money on his pet projects and political priorities."&lt;ref name="fp"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Groll|first1=Elias|title=Why Is Putin's 'Private Slush Fund' Courting Jared Kushner?|url=https://foreignpolicy.com/2017/04/07/why-is-putins-private-slush-fund-courting-jared-kushner/|accessdate=30 May 2017|work=[[Foreign Policy]]|date=7 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; When Gorkov arrived in 2012, VEB was struggling to stay afloat; it reportedly needed 1.3 trillion rubles (approximately $22.8 billion) by 2020 to avoid defaulting on its debt.&lt;ref name="forbes217"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Solodkov|first1=Vasily|title=Что не так с ВЭБом: почему, несмотря на господдержку, он убыточен|url=http://www.forbes.ru/biznes/335495-chto-ne-tak-s-vebom-pochemu-nesmotrya-na-gospodderzhku-po-prezhnemu-ubytochen|accessdate=26 May 2017|work=[[Forbes]]|date=19 December 2016|language=ru}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2015, the bank received a $20 billion bailout&lt;ref name="dailybeast"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Weiss|first1=Michael|title=Jared Kushner Tempted by Russia's Bank of Spies|url=http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2017/03/28/jared-kushner-tempted-by-russia-s-bank-of-spies|accessdate=26 May 2017|work=[[The Daily Beast]]|date=30 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; following approval of [[Ministry of Finance (Russia)|Minister of Finance]] [[Anton Siluanov]].&lt;ref name="rbc"/&gt;&lt;ref name="fp"/&gt;

In July 2014, Vnesheconombank was [[International sanctions during the Ukrainian crisis|slapped with sanctions]] by the European Union and the United States over the [[Russian military intervention in Ukraine (2014–present)|Russian invasion of Ukraine]]; however, Gorkov has said that the bank is aggressively pursuing business in China.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=«Проектов больше, чем денег»: глава ВЭБа Сергей Горьков о китайских кредитах в 2017 году|url=https://russian.rt.com/business/article/353245-veb-kredit-kitai|accessdate=25 May 2017|publisher=RT|date=25 January 2017|language=ru-RU}}&lt;/ref&gt; The bank is also pursuing deals in the [[Persian Gulf]] and Islamic world. In 2016, Gorkov announced VEB would partner with the [[Islamic Development Bank]] in [[Saudi Arabia]], a financing conglomerate of 56 Islamic countries,&lt;ref name="vesti"&gt;{{cite news|title=Три основных направления стратегии ВЭБа|url=http://www.vestifinance.ru/articles/73171|accessdate=30 May 2017|work=Vesti Finance|date=21 July 2016|language=ru}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Russia’s VEB planning first deals with Islamic Development Bank|url=http://tass.com/economy/877158|accessdate=30 May 2017|agency=TASS|date=20 May 2016|language=ru}}&lt;/ref&gt; with an initial pilot project of $100 million.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Russia’s VEB considers $100 mln pilot deal with Islamic Development Bank|url=http://tass.com/economy/893641|accessdate=30 May 2017|agency=TASS|date=10 August 2016|language=ru}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Meeting with Jared Kushner===

In 2017, Gorkov drew significant attention in Western media over his December 2016 meeting with [[Jared Kushner]], son-in-law and top adviser to then president-elect [[Donald Trump]]. In March 2017, [[White House Press Secretary]] [[Sean Spicer]] stated that Kushner met with Gorkov briefly as part of his role in the transition and as a diplomatic conduit to the [[United States Department of State|State Department]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Pavia|first1=Will|title=Kushner's Kremlin connection focus|url=http://www.theaustralian.com.au/news/world/the-times/jared-kushner-named-as-person-of-interest-in-russia-probe/news-story/bd81a5a645f7138c6ad8f30fbffe5d80|accessdate=26 May 2017|work=The Australian|date=25 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, VEB issued a statement that said Gorkov met with Kushner on a private matter concerning his family's real estate corporation, [[Kushner Companies]], even though VEB has been under [[International sanctions during the Ukrainian crisis#Third|international sanctions since July 2014]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Dilanian|first1=Ken|last2=Alexander|first2=Peter|last3=Kube|first3=Courtney|title=Jared Kushner under FBI scrutiny in Russia probe, say officials|url=http://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/jared-kushner-now-under-fbi-scrutiny-russia-probe-say-officials-n764826|accessdate=26 May 2017|publisher=NBC News|date=25 May 2017|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; The statement, issued to [[Reuters]], said that Gorkov met "with a number of representatives of the largest banks and business establishments of the United States, including Jared Kushner, the head of Kushner Companies."&lt;ref name="dailybeast"/&gt; According to multiple reports, Kushner is looking for investors in his project at [[666 Fifth Avenue]], which Kushner Companies bought for a record $1.8 billion in January 2007 prior to the recession.&lt;ref name="nytimes317"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Frank|first1=Thomas|last2=Cohen|first2=Marshall|title=Russian banker who met Kushner has Putin ties|url=http://www.cnn.com/2017/03/27/politics/kushner-meeting-russian-banker-tied-to-putin/|accessdate=26 May 2017|publisher=CNN|date=28 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Dilanian|first1=Ken|last2=Caldwell|first2=Leigh Ann|last3=Siemaszko|first3=Corky|title=Was Kushner seeking a Russian bailout for his Manhattan building?

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6874">'''Social dialogue''' (or social concertation) is the process whereby [[social partners]] (trade unions and employer organisations) negotiate, often in collaboration with the government, to influence the arrangement and development of work-related issues, labour market policies, social protection, taxation or other economic policies. It is a widespread procedure to develop public policies in Western Europe in particular.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last = Baccaro &amp; Simoni|first =|date = 2008|title = Policy Concertation in Europe|url = http://cps.sagepub.com/content/41/10/1323.abstract|journal = Comparative Political Studies|volume = 41|issue = 10|doi = 10.1177/0010414008315861|pmid =|access-date = 3 September 2016|via =}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

These can be direct relations between the social partners themselves ("bipartite") or relations between governmental authorities and the social partners ("tripartite").
To make it more clear, Social dialogue can mean negotiation, consultation or simply an exchange of views between representatives of employers, workers and governments. It may consist of relations between labour and management, with or without direct government involvement. Social dialogue is a flexible tool that enables governments and employers’ and workers’ organizations to manage change and achieve economic and social goals.

Examples of social dialogue activity include mutual information, open discussion, concertation&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title = Social Concertation in Times of Austerity|url = https://www.oapen.org/search?identifier=442727|publisher = Amsterdam University Press|date = 2013-01-01|isbn = 9789089643957|language = en|first = Alexandre|last = Afonso}}&lt;/ref&gt; (on-going tripartite dialogue), exchanges of opinions, consultation and negotiation (agreements /common opinions).

European social dialogue is enshrined in the [[Treaty establishing the European Community]] (articles 138 and 139; ex 118a and 118b) and it is promoted by the [[European Commission]] as an instrument for a better governance and promotion of social and economic reforms.

==Definition==
According to the [[ILO]]’s definition, it means the practice of [[tripartism]] between governments and the representative organizations of workers and employers within and across borders are now more relevant to achieving solutions and to building up social cohesion and the rule of law through, among other means, international labor standards.&lt;ref&gt;ILO Declaration on Social Justice for a Fair Globalization&lt;/ref&gt;

==Purpose==
The aim of social dialogue is to advance opportunities for women and men to obtain decent and productive work in conditions of freedom, equality, security and human dignity.

==Enabling conditions==
Social dialogue includes all types of negotiation, consultation and exchange of information between, or among, representatives of governments, employers and workers on issues of common interest&lt;ref&gt;Ishikawa,2003&lt;/ref&gt;

1. Respect for the fundamental rights of freedom of association and [[collective bargaining]].

2. Strong, independent workers' and employers' organizations with the technical capacity and knowledge required to participate in social dialogue.

3. Political will and commitment to engage in social dialogue on the part of all parties.

4. Appropriate institutional support.
&lt;ref&gt;International labor organization official website social dialogue&lt;/ref&gt;

==Means==
1. Information sharing：

The inevitable foundation of effective social dialogue is to share information.Even It doesn’t include discussion or real action, it still have its meaning.

2. Consultation：

Consultation exceeds information sharing, it needs exchanging perspective, opinion, ideas, and forms a deep conversation.

3. Negotiation/Conclude convention：

Some members need to be authorized to form the binding conventions.

4. Collective bargaining：

Collective bargaining is not only the inseparable form in social dialogue, but also be widely used. In every country, Collective      
bargaining is an indicator to identify the ability of social dialogue’s level.

==The dilemma of pushing==
Social dialogue faced challenge in some countries. Take Croatia for example, government and social partner couldn’t have consensus on adoption to overcome economic crisis in terms of public cost decrease and job saving through bargaining in several months.

==The difference in nations==
Social dialogue may take place at different levels and in various form, depending on national circumstances.

===France===

Social dialogue in [[France]] was hard to be national because of the political opposite in groups of social partner. Except for collective bargaining, it highlighted the discussion in tripartism on the issues of employment policy and human resource development. Employment committee in France proceeded consultation and participation of policy establishment on the issues of promoting employment and job training.

===Germany===

Because of the high coverage rate of unions and employers’ groups in [[Germany]], and less of problems in political and ideological conflicts, social dialogue in national level elaborated higher influence on establishment of national policies. Except for job training and employment security, it also emphasized bargaining and negotiation in work conditions, including shortening of work hours and wage increase.

===Austria, Denmark, Ireland and Holland===

When European Union (EU) suffered from the high rate of unemployment, there was brilliant performances in terms of macroeconomic development and employment rate in [[Austria]], [[Denmark]], [[Ireland]] and Holland at the 1990s. Take 2001 for example, the unemployment rate of other 15 countries in EU was up to 7.4 percent. On the contrary, the unemployment rate of these four countries was merely 3.5 percent. ILO thought that the main reason of these four countries’ success was social dialogue, macroeconomic policies and labor market policies. For instance, the Wassenaar Agreement signed in Holland in 1982, and Denmark advocated the national recovery program with Ireland in 1987. These agreements stood for the will of social partner to solve economic dilemma.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="23365">The '''societal marketing'''  is a marketing concept that holds that a company should make marketing decisions not only by considering consumers' wants, the company's requirements, but also  society's long-term interests.

The societal marketing concept holds that the organization's task is to determine the needs, wants, and interests of a [[target market]] and to deliver the desired satisfactions more effectively and efficiently than [[competitors]] in a way that preserves or enhances the well being of both the individual consumer and society in general. Therefore, marketers must endeavor to satisfy the needs and wants of their target markets in ways that preserve and enhance the well-being of consumers and society as a whole. {{ref|Kotler2000}} It is closely linked with the principles of [[corporate social responsibility]] and of [[sustainable development]].

==Definition==
Societal marketing can be defined as a "marketing with a social dimension or marketing that includes non-economic criteria". &lt;ref&gt; Handelman, Jay M. and Arnold, Stephen J., "The Role of Marketing Actions with a Social Dimension: Appeals to the Institutional Environment," ''Journal of Marketing,'' Vol. 63, No. 3, July, 1999, pp 33-48&lt;/ref&gt;  Societal marketing "concerns for society's long term interests".&lt;ref&gt;Elliot, G.R., "The Marketing Concept: Necessary but sufficient? An environmental view," ''European Journal of Marketing,'' Vol. 24, No. 8, pp.23-30, https://doi.org/10.1108/EUM0000000000612&lt;/ref&gt; It is about "the direct benefits for the organization and secondary benefit for the community". &lt;ref&gt;McColl-Kennedy, J., Kiel, G., Lusch, R. and Lusch, V., ''Marketing: Concepts and Strategies,'' Nelson Australia, Melbourne, 2001, &lt;/ref&gt; Societal marketing distinguishes between the consumer's immediate satisfaction and longer term consumer and social benefits. Accordingly, [[Andreas Kaplan]] defines societal management as "management that takes into account society's overall welfare in addition to mere profitability considerations." &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title=Andreas Kaplan: European Management and European Business Schools: Insights from the History of Business Schools | doi=10.1016/j.emj.2014.03.006 | volume=32 | issue=4 | journal=European Management Journal | pages=529–534| year=2014 | last1=Kaplan | first1=Andreas }}&lt;/ref&gt; Its a 3 dimensional concept of marketing ;Social welfare,Individual welfare,Company profits.

==Objectives== 
Various attempts to define the objectives of societal marketing have been noted,&lt;ref&gt;Gaski, J.F., "Dangerous Territory: The societal marketing concept revisited", ''Business Horizons,'' Vol. 28, No. 4, pp 42-47&lt;/ref&gt; such as:
* "[[Social responsibility]] implies that a business decision maker... is obliged to take actions that also protect and enhance society's interests.
* "Business has the responsibility to help [the consumer] ... It is the duty of business to promote proper consumption values."
* "Business leaders are mandated to adopt roles of leadership in  the advancement of our society to new levels of moral conduct."

==History==
The concept of societal marketing emerged in the early 1970s, promoting a more socially responsible, moral and ethical model of marketing in an effort to counter some of the more serious criticisms of marketing that had arisen out of the [[consumerism|consumerist]] movement around that time. &lt;ref&gt;Crane, A. and Desmond, J., "Societal marketing and morality", ''European Journal of Marketing,'' Vol. 36, No. 5/6, pp548-569, https://doi.org/10.1108/03090560210423014&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Philip Kotler]] is generally credited with introducing the societal marketing concept to the literature in a 1972 article "What Consumerism Means for Marketers" in the ''Harvard Business Review'' of 1972.&lt;ref&gt;Blackwell Reference, http://www.blackwellreference.com/public/tocnode?id=g9780631233176_chunk_g978140510254422_ss1-48&lt;/ref&gt; Certainly Kotler believed that he had coined the term, "societal marketing" and was the first to codify it within the [[marketing literature]]. &lt;ref&gt;Kotler, P., "What Consumerism Means for Marketers," ''Harvard Business Review,'' Vol. 50, No. 3, May-June, 1972, pp. 48-57 &lt;/ref&gt; Some marketing historians, notably Wilkie and Moore, have argued that a societal perspective was not new, and that evidence for it could be found in marketing theory and in marketing texts, since the discipline's inception in the early 1900s. &lt;ref&gt;Wilkie, W.L. and Moore, E.S., "Macromarketing as a Pillar of Marketing Thought," ''Journal of Macromarketing,'' Vol. 26 No. 2, December 2006, pp 224-232 DOI: 10.1177/0276146706291067; Wilkie, W. L. and Moore, E.S., "Scholarly Research in Marketing: Exploring the “4 Eras” of Thought Development," ''Journal of Public Policy and Marketing,'' Vol. 22, No. 2, 2003, pp 116–146 &lt;/ref&gt; Kotler introduced both the concept of [[social marketing]] (extending marketing technologies into non-business areas) and societal marketing, arguing that the marketing concept and its technologies must be tempered and ultimately revised by adopting a more explicit social orientation.&lt;ref&gt;Crane, A. Desmond, J., "Societal marketing and morality", ''European Journal of Marketing,'' 2002,  Vol 36, No. 5/6, pp 48-569&lt;/ref&gt; The novelty of Kotler's concept was the idea of "long-run consumer welfare", emphasizing that the short-term desires might not support the consumer's long term interests or be good for the society as a whole.

The societal marketing concept adopts the position that marketers have a greater social responsibility than simply satisfying customers and providing them with superior [[Value (marketing)|value]]. Instead, marketing activities should strive to benefit society's overall well-being. Marketing organisations that have embraced the societal marketing concept typically identify key stakeholder groups including: employees, customers, local communities, the wider public and government and consider the impact of their activities on all stakeholders. They ensure that marketing activities do not damage the environment and are not hazardous to broader society. Societal marketing developed into [[sustainable marketing]].&lt;ref&gt;Kotler, P and Armstrong, G., ''Principles of Marketing,'' 9th ed., Prentice Hall, 2000; Griffin, R.W.  and Ebert, E.J., ''Business '' 5th edition, Prentice Hall, 1998&lt;/ref&gt; Societal marketing requires businesses to include social, ethical and ecological considerations in product and market planning. &lt;ref&gt;Abratt, Russell and Sacks, Diane, "Perceptions of the Societal Marketing Concept", ''European Journal of Marketing,'' Vol. 23, No. 6, 1989, pp. 25–33&lt;/ref&gt;

==Instruments==
Kotler identified four categories of products, classified in terms of long term benefits and immediate satisfaction: &lt;ref&gt;Kotler, P., "What Consumerism Means for Marketers," ''Harvard Business Review,'' Vol. 50, May-June, pp. 54-56&lt;/ref&gt; 
[[File:Papierosa 1 ubt 0069.jpeg|thumb|Cigarettes are typically classified as a '' pleasing products'' since they deliver immediate benefits with long-term social harm]]
#Deficient products, which bring neither long-run or short term benefits
#Pleasing products, which bring a high level of immediate [[Customer satisfaction|satisfaction]], but can cause harm to the society in the long run
#Salutary products, which bring low short term satisfaction, but benefit the society on the long run
#Desirable products, which combine long-run benefit and immediate satisfaction

Kotler's concept of societal marketing suggested that for the well-being of society, deficient products should be eliminated from the market, pleasing and salutary products should go through a product modification process to acquire desirable status, by incorporating missing short term benefits into salutary products and long term benefits into pleasing products, and the companies' ultimate goal should be to develop desirable products. Rather than focusing on selling a products, which can be good or bad for the consumers,  companies should focus on consumer and society's well-being.

==Examples==
Most companies recognize that socially responsible activities improve their image among customers, [[stockholders]], the [[financial community]], and other relevant publics. Ethical and socially responsible practices are simply good business, resulting not only in favorable image, but ultimately in increased sales.

*[[The Body Shop]]: The Body Shop International plc is the original, natural and ethical beauty brand. The company uses only plant based materials for its products. It is against [[Animal testing]], supports community trade, activate Self Esteem, Defend Human Rights, and overall protection of the planet. They have also their own charity, The Body Shop Foundation, to assist those working to achieve progress in the areas of human and civil rights, environmental and animal protection. Thus Body shop is really following the concept of Societal Marketing.&lt;ref&gt;The Body Shop, www.thebodyshop.com/_en/_ww/services/aboutus_company.aspx)&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[Avon Products|AVON]] Product inc. has started an initiative known as Avon [[breast cancer]] awareness crusade in 1993 in partnership with National Alliance of breast cancer Foundation (NABCO).They started selling pink ribbon pins which depicts the international symbol for breast cancer for$2 and donates $1 to NABCO. Through the crusade Avon sale representatives have raised billion of dollars for breast cancer education and access to early detection services for underserved woman. In addition, Avon's 45,000 US sales people have been trained to discuss breast cancer and importance of early detection with their customers and distributed 80 million flyers on breast cancer detection.&lt;ref&gt;Bloom N. Paul and Gundlach T. Gregory, ''Handbook of Marketing and Society,'' Sage publications, 2001&lt;/ref&gt;

==Societal marketing v social marketing==
Societal marketing should not be confused with [[social marketing]]. Societal marketing is a philosophy or mindset that informs marketing decisions whereas social marketing is a distinct branch within the marketing discipline. Societal marketing is concerned with the consideration of the social and ethical aspects of marketing planning. Social marketing is concerned with facilitating social change. A key difference is that the greater 'social good' is the ''principal'' consideration in social marketing while social benefits are one of a number of considerations in societal marketing.  

On the other hand, social marketing is a sub-branch of marketing that began in 1971, with the publication of an article by Kotler and Zaltman, emphasising a planned approach to achieving social change. It is primarily concerned with encouraging pro-social behaviours (e.g. recycling, sun-safety, safe driving practices) and discouraging anti-social behaviours (e.g. littering, drink-driving). &lt;ref&gt;Kotler P and Zaltman G., "Social Marketing: An Approach to Planned Social Change,"  ''Journal of Marketing, Vol. 35. No. 3, 1971, pp 3-12&lt;/ref&gt; It is defined as an "adaptation of commercial marketing technologies to programs designed to influence the voluntary behavior of target audiences to improve their personal welfare and that of the society of which they are a part".&lt;ref&gt;Andreasen, A., ''Marketing Social Change: Changing Behavior to Promote Health, Social Development and the Environment,'' San Francisco: Jossey Bass, 1995&lt;/ref&gt; 

Social marketing uses more traditional commercial techniques and strategies, focusing on persuasion, to achieve goals for the greater social good. Its [[Advertising campaign|campaigns]] can either encourage [[merit good]]s, as for example fund raising for not-for-profit organizations or dissuade the use of [[demerit good]]s promoting society's well being, as non-smoking campaigns or promote the use of seat belts. Another characteristic of social marketing is that is planned to influence individual behaviour to improve well-being. It includes more than just [[advertising]] in traditional mass media, and may extend to educational programs and formal enforcement regimes in the case of road safety campaigns.&lt;ref&gt;Belz, Frank Martin and Peattie, Ken, ''Sustainability Marketing,'' John Wiley and Sons, 2010&lt;/ref&gt; It planned campaigns, implemented by governmental and non-governmental organisations. A clear example that differentiates societal from social marketing is a marketing campaign on non-smoking. A smoking cessation advertisement is an example of social marketing, but if the marketing strategies and techniques used in that campaign focus on increasing the well-being of society, that same campaign can be an example of societal marketing.

The societal marketing concept was a forerunner of sustainable marketing in integrating issues of social responsibility into commercial [[marketing strategies]]. In contrast to that, social marketing uses commercial marketing theories, tools and techniques to influence social change. Social marketing applies a "customer orientated" approach and uses the concepts and tools used by commercial marketers in pursuit of social goals like Anti-Smoking-Campaigns or fund raising for NGOs.

== Corporate social responsibility (CSR)==
Unlike societal marketing, CSR has existed for many years. Another difference is that CSR "focuses more in a [[corporate]] level and stakeholders", &lt;ref&gt; Belz, Frank Martin and Peattie, Ken, ''Sustainability Marketing,'' John Wiley and Sons, 2010&lt;/ref&gt; while societal marketing is more concerned about the consumer and their long term benefits. CSR social and environmental concerns are integrated into all business operations. CSR is mainly run by companies, while social marketing mainly by Government or Non profits organizations. One example of CSR among companies is what [[Häagen-Dazs]] is doing with their "microsite" to raise awareness to the general public about the preservation of the honeybee.

==Branding==
Corporations are the one who are striving during the whole time for improvements. They are turning to all kind of forms of [[corporate societal marketing]] programs to help build and repair their brand images.

Corporate Social Marketing, or CSM, usually refers to marketing efforts that have at least one social related objective, such as charity founding, among its goals. Typical examples are releasing a certain percentage of the final sale product to a charity related to the product, or sponsoring events that encourage social well-being such as the Olympic Games. Corporate Social Marketing benefits a company in many ways, but its main goal is to improve the image the public has of the company. A company that appears committed to improving the lives or others, the environment or other worthy causes is seen in a better light than one who doesn't, and more and more business are hoping to benefit from that.

So, it can be so, that CSM programs are becoming extremely popular because the leaders believe that it is a good business to be viewed as a socially responsible company.&lt;ref&gt;Business in the Community, "Businesses Use Marketing Muscle to Tackle Social Issues", in ''Cause-related Marketing Website,''&lt;/ref&gt; However, even though past research suggests that CSM may be effective in improving [[brand equity]] and increasing market share, there are limits to the effectiveness of these initiatives.

An example of his is how corporate social initiatives adversely affected purchase intentions if consumers perceived that the company would forgo product quality in order to be socially responsible.&lt;ref&gt;Sen, Sankar and Bhattacharya, C.B., "Does Doing Good Always Lead to Doing better, Consumer Reactions to Corporate Societal Responsibility," ''Journal of Marketing Research,'' Vol 38, May, 2001&lt;/ref&gt;

Depending on the nature of the CSM program, the intent of the corporation may not be as obvious to the consumers. This happens if the benefits to the corporation are not apparent or conflicts with what the consumer already believes about a specific firm or industry.

Since firms exist to make a profit, consumers may spend considerable energy in an attempt to infer motives related to the profit-oriented goals. As an example, a consumer may be suspicious of a tobacco company that undertakes a campaign to prevent underage smoking. If this is successful, the company would be affected and the cigarette sales will be lowered. So, in this situation, consumers' suspicions may lead them to infer motives that would actually protect the companies financial condition – as they are trying to improve their image to sell more cigarettes to adults. However, if a tobacco company undertook a CSM Campaign, that would sustain their business consumers may be able to infer profit motives more easily and then have a more favorable attitude toward the partnership. Therefore, it can be concluded that the attitude of the consumers could be better if they knew more about the motives of the companies and they were more obvious.

Another aspect that may cause suspicion with consumers is the amount of harm that a company has already done, either because of unsafe products or harmful production practices. It is logical that consumers are more suspicious to companies that sell harmful products. Again examples are the tobacco companies and alcohol companies as well. They will meet resistance from consumers when they undertake socially-oriented campaigns aimed at mitigating the effects of their products.&lt;ref&gt;Hoeffler, Steve and Keller, Kevin Lane, "Building Brand Equity through Corporate Societal Marketing", ''Journal of Public Policy and Marketing,'' Vol. 21, No. 1, 2002&lt;/ref&gt; That is why when different industries are separated, two very general dimensions are used – the harmful nature of the products and the harmful nature of the production methods.

This classification can briefly show how consumer are influenced by the various CSM efforts. Companies that work in this "dangerous" industries are not that successful always, because the consumers may be suspicious of any societal efforts the company attempts to undertake. Consumers will infer less society-serving motives and more self-serving motives for corporate societal marketing programs undertaken by firms that operate in mixed or sin industries.

Based on how easily consumers could infer profit-driven motives, are classified the types of CSM campaigns: Positively tied to product sales, positively tied to product sales, not directly tied to sales but aimed at sustaining the company's business, completely unrelated.

==Criticisms==
Societal marketing has been the subject of a number of criticisms: 

A key issue concerns the question of who decides what is in the public’s best interests. The moral agenda implicit in the societal marketing concept is underdeveloped and often implicit. &lt;ref&gt;Crane, A. and Desmond, J., "Societal marketing and morality", European Journal of Marketing, Vol. 36 Issue: 5/6, 2002, p. 548&lt;/ref&gt; Gaski argued that marketers should step away from their classic goal of [[customer satisfaction]] and [[profit maximization]] while respecting the minimum governmental standards imposed by law and enter this [[public policy]] area, since marketers themselves would have to decide what actions are consistent with public welfare. Marketers might have neither the competence nor the right to determine the "public interest." Instead, it should be the customers who decide what is good for them, or their political representatives and dictate that to the industry. &lt;ref&gt;Gaski, J.F., "Dangerous Territory: The societal marketing concept revisited", ''Business Horizons,'' Vol. 28, No. 4, 1985, 42-47&lt;/ref&gt;

Some scholars have argued that societal marketing is not a distinct concept, but rather it is a mere extension of the marketing concept. Others have pointed out that the literature in the field is vague, poorly defined and underdeveloped. &lt;ref&gt;Crane, A. and Desmond, J., "Societal marketing and morality", European Journal of Marketing, Vol. 36 Issue: 5/6, 2002, p. 548&lt;/ref&gt; The societal marketing concept has become an excellent strategy for promotions with social dimensions and for exploring consumers' behavioural response to such corporate 'doing good'.

; Future development of the concept:
Societal marketing is gaining the marketers and consumer attention  and there is every reason to expect it to continue to evolve in practice. It focuses on providing win-win opportunities to companies, consumers and society. But achieving the compelling benefits for each party involved is very complicated. So much more research is needed. To achieve a win situation for organization involved, is dependent largely upon how the key constituents react. In this context, anticipating consumer reaction is really challenging which can be affected by number of factors that often vary across different segments. The several research questions remain to be answered like how different factors affects reaction to societal marketing and how do the various factors interact? How can societal initiatives be designed to leverage positive reaction and mitigate negative ones? &lt;ref&gt;Bloom N. Paul and Gundlach T. Gregory, ''Handbook of Marketing and Society,'' Sage publications, 2001&lt;/ref&gt;

For consumers to win, societal marketing must provide them with compelling benefits that increase their overall welfare. What benefits did societal marketing initiative actually provided to consumers? Are there direct benefits such as increased satisfaction with their interaction with commercial or nonprofit organization?
Determining whether there is a win situation for society by societal marketing initiative is the most difficult question to be answered. We turn to the two questions proposed by Bloom, Hussien and Szykmann (1995):  Is the society better off because of this program? Does corporate involvement result in better performance than if it would have been managed by NGOs or government agencies? 
Societal marketing is becoming globally popular but there exist a scarcity of research in this field. Therefore extensive future research is needed particularly investigating questions with respect to its impact on consumer attitudes to corporate image, product image and their purchase intention or brand choice as well as on positive impact on society.&lt;ref&gt;Bloom N. Paul and Gundlach T. Gregory, ''Handbook of Marketing and Society,'' Sage publications, 2001&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Sustainopreneurship''' (entrepreneurship and innovation for sustainability) is a concept that has emerged from the earlier concepts [[social entrepreneurship]] and [[ecopreneurship]], via sustainability entrepreneurship. The concept means to use creative business organizing to solve problems related to sustainability to create social and environmental sustainability as a [[strategic objective]] and purpose, at the same time respecting the boundaries set in order to maintain the life support systems in the process. In other words, it is a "business with a cause" – where the [[global issues|world problems]] are turned into [[business opportunities]] by deployment of sustainability innovations. 

==Definition==

The definition first introduced in a conference article in 2006:&lt;ref name="ftn0"&gt;Abrahamsson, A. (2006) Sustainopreneurship – Business with a Cause. in Science Sustainable Development – Starting Points and Critical Reflections, Uppsala: VHU – Föreningen Vetenskap för Hållbar Utveckling (Swedish Society for Sustainable Development), pp. 21-30. {{ISBN|91-631-9222-5}}. [http://www.vhu.se/site/The-Swedish-Research-Association-for-Sustainable-Development.html]&lt;/ref&gt;

# Deployment of sustainability innovations: Entrepreneurship and innovation for sustainability. 
# Short for sustainability intra-/entrepreneurship. 
# To focus on one or more (world/social/sustainability-related) problem(s), find/identify and/or invent a solution to the problem(s) and bring the innovation to the market by creating an efficient organization. With the (new alt. deep transformation of an old) mission/cause-oriented sustainability business adding ecological/economical/social values and gains, with a bias towards the intangible – through dematerialization/resocialization. The value added at the same time preserving, restoring and/or ultimately enhancing the underlying utilized capital stock, in order to maintain the capacity to fulfil the needs of present and coming generations of stakeholders.

==Conceptual development==

The business world has been nominated as a premier force for creating a sustainable world,&lt;ref name="ftn1"&gt;Hart, S. L. (2005) Capitalism at the Crossroads: the Unlimited Business Opportunities in Solving the World's Most Difficult Problems. Philadelphia: Wharton School Publishing., p 3-7.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ftn2"&gt;Prahalad, C. K. (2004) The Fortune at the Bottom of the Pyramid – Eradicating Poverty Through Profits, Philadelphia: Wharton School Publishing.&lt;/ref&gt; especially when acting as a source of innovation and creativity – e. g. as Robinson (2004:378)&lt;ref name="ftn3"&gt;Robinson, J. (2004)'' ''Squaring the Circle? Some thoughts on the idea of Sustainable Development, ''Ecological Economics,'' 48:4, pp. 369-384.&lt;/ref&gt; puts it:

:''"In addition to integrating across fields, sustainability must also be integrated across sectors or interests. It is clear that governments alone have neither the will nor the capability to accomplish sustainability on their own. The private sector, as the chief engine of economic activity on the planet, and '''a major source for creativity, innovation and entrepreneurship,''' must be involved in trying to achieve sustainability."'' 

Sustainopreneurship is a candidate to be the accentuating factor to give even more leverage to forces emerging from world of business activities to contribute to sustainability. The concept of sustainopreneurship was first introduced as a term in 2000&lt;ref name="ftn4"&gt;Schaltegger, S. (2000) Vom Bionier zum Sustainopreneur, Presentation at Rio Impuls Management Forum 2000, Home Page of conference {{cite web |url=http://www.rio.ch/Pages/archiv/2000rmf.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2009-12-22 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110707001904/http://www.rio.ch/Pages/archiv/2000rmf.html |archivedate=2011-07-07 |df= }}, presentation accessible at {{cite web |url=http://www.rio.ch/Pages/rmf2000/referate/Schaltegger.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2009-12-22 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110707002241/http://www.rio.ch/Pages/rmf2000/referate/Schaltegger.pdf |archivedate=2011-07-07 |df= }}, (accessed 2007-04-16).&lt;/ref&gt; where it was predominantly related to the proactive change management approaches associated with process adjustment with increased respect to the environment. The phenomenon developed with publications in 2003,&lt;ref name="ftn5"&gt;Hockerts, K. (2003) Sustainability Innovation: Ecological and Social Entrepreneurship and the Managing of Antagonistic Assets'', ''PhD Dissertation, University of St. Gallen, Schweiz.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ftn6"&gt;Gerlach, A. (2003a) Sustainable entrepreneurship and innovation, Centre for Sustainability Management, University of Lueneburg, Conference Proceedings of Conference Corporate Social Responsibility and Environmental Management 2003 in Leeds, UK.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ftn7"&gt;Gerlach, A. (2003b) Innovativität und Sustainability Intrapreneurship,'' ''Paper presented at Sustainable Management in Action '03, University of St. Gallen, Schweiz.&lt;/ref&gt; and further evolved and was tentatively defined in 2006 by Anders Abrahamsson.&lt;ref name="ftn8"&gt;Abrahamsson, A. (2006), Ibid.&lt;/ref&gt; This tentative definition was empirically tested in his Master thesis,&lt;ref name="ftn11"&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;Abrahamsson, A. (2007a) Sustainopreneurship – Business with a Cause: Conceptualizing Entrepreneurship for Sustainability. [Master Thesis in Business Administration.] Växjö: Reports from Växjö University: Business administration and economics. http://www.diva-portal.org/vxu/abstract.xsql?dbid=1254, (accessed 2007-05-25).&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; where the enactive research process&lt;ref name="ftn9"&gt;Johannisson, B. (2002) Enacting Entrepreneurship – Using Auto-Ethnography to Study Organization Creation, Paper presented the conference ''Ethnographic Organizational Studies'', University of St. Gallen, Switzerland, September 19-21, 2002. &lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ftn10"&gt;Johannisson, B. (2005) Entreprenörskapets väsen, Lund: Studentlitteratur.&lt;/ref&gt; confirmed that the definition stood the test contrasting it towards the auto-ethnographical empirical material. A paper to identify future research challenges was made beyond this in 2007,&lt;ref name="ftn12"&gt;Abrahamsson, A. (2007b), Researching Sustainopreneurship – conditions, concepts, approaches, arenas and questions. An invitation to authentic sustainability business forces. Paper presented at the 13th International Sustainable Development Research Conference, Mälardalens Högskola, Västerås, 10-12 June, 2007&lt;/ref&gt; and developed further with a book chapter published in September 2008.&lt;ref name="ftn13"&gt;Abrahamsson, A. (2008), Sustainopreneurship – Business with a Cause. The Promise of Creative Organizing for Sustainability. In "Bridging the Functional and Territorial Views on Regional Entrepreneurship and Development", eds. Bengt Johannisson and Åsa Lindholm-Dahlstrand. Örebro: FSF (Swedish Foundation for Small Business Research). {{ISBN|91-89301-27-7}}. [http://www.fsf.se/publikation/lista/2008_6.htm]&lt;/ref&gt;

In general, the entrepreneurial discourse has opened up to move beyond a strictly economic phenomenon, rather than being perceived primarily as a social process at large.&lt;ref name="ftn17"&gt;Steyaert, C., Katz, J. (2004) Reclaiming the space of entrepreneurship in society: geographical, discursive and social dimensions, Entrepreneurship and Business Development 2004:3, pp. 179-196, special issue on Social Entrepreneurship.&lt;/ref&gt; Preceding the conceptual formation were two traces of social entrepreneurship and eco-preneurship, dealing primarily with the social and ecological dimensions of sustainability. Primary associations with [[social entrepreneurship]] have also been establishing not-for-profit venturing and charities to innovatively address and solve social problems, whereas [[ecopreneurship]] has been primarily focused on solving environmental problems.&lt;ref name="ftn7"/&gt; See [[Principles of ecopreneurship]].

Both these traces of conceptual development are taken beyond, merge and integrate into the suggested conceptual construct at hand, where distinctions are made from both of these concepts – sustainopreneurial processes taking place institutionally through for-profit organizing, but not with profit as its main driving force. Sustainopreneurial venturing is done in a holistic manner that meets both ecological and social challenges simultaneously with regard to both purpose and process. 

=== Three main dimensions ===

The definition of sustainopreneurship needs to be highlighted by three distinguishing dimensions with all three being simultaneously present in the applied (inter)action it reflects. The first is oriented towards "why" – its purpose and motive. The second and third are reflecting two "how"-related dimensions – its process. 

'''1. Sustainopreneurship consciously sets out to find and/or create innovations to solve sustainability-related problems'''

:The conscious mission that guides the action, especially in the nascent '-preneurial' stage before venturing forms and formalizes into an institutionalized business entity, is to deliberately find practical and innovative solutions to problems related to the sustainability agenda. This is the main key to distinguish this category of entrepreneurial activity and behaviour labelled sustainopreneurship from generic entrepreneurial activity: the cause-oriented intention that places the core motive, purpose and driving-force of the business activities. To identify and further grasp what is meant by sustainability problems, central sources in the global sustainable development discourse are identified, which guide us to what is meant practically and operationally by ''sustainability in action.'' The outcome of diverse sources are summarized in this list of ''"sustainability-related problems",'' determined by the political action plan documented in ''Agenda 21'',&lt;ref name="ftn14"&gt;''UN, Conference on Environment and Development (1992a) Main Documents, download page, http://www.un.org/esa/sustdev/documents/docs_unced.htm; including Agenda 21, http://www.un.org/esa/sustdev/documents/agenda21/index.htm, (accessed 2007-04-16).''&lt;/ref&gt; the ''Millennium Declaration'' defining the ''[[Millennium Development Goals]],&lt;ref name="ftn15"&gt;''UN, Millennium Development Goals (2000) Homepage, http://www.un.org/millenniumgoals, (accessed 2007-04-16).''&lt;/ref&gt; both agreed at the ''Millennium Summit'' in New York 2000, and the ''WSSD Plan of Implementation'' decided upon at the World Summit on Sustainable Development in Johannesburg 2002.&lt;ref name="ftn16"&gt;UN, World Summit on Sustainable Development (2002b) Homepage, http://www.johannesburgsummit.org, with WSSD Plan of Implementation, TOC with access to the full document, http://www.un.org/esa/sustdev/documents/WSSD_POI_PD/English/POIToc.htm, (accessed 2007-04-16).&lt;/ref&gt; This list, derived and synthesized from these sources, lines up areas with associated problems to solve, goals to reach and values to create:

* [[Poverty]]
* [[Water and sanitation]]
* [[Public health|Health]]
* Education/[[illiteracy]]
* [[Sustainable production]] and consumption patterns
*  [[climate and energy|Climate change and energy systems]]
* Chemicals
* [[Urbanization]]
* Ecosystems, [[biological diversity]] and [[land use]]
* Utilization of sea resources
* Food and agriculture
* [[Trade justice]]
* [[Social stability]], democracy and good governance
* [[Peace]] and security


'''2. Sustainopreneurship means to get solutions to the market through creative organizing''' 

:The line-up above could make one easily depressed. But, a fundamental attitude to acquire and maintain when this list of sustainability-related problems is compiled and then considered is to avoid falling into disempowerment and despair. It is of core importance to take the agenda as entrepreneurial ''challenges'' – to view problems as ''possibilities'', obstacles as ''opportunities'', and resistance as a ''resource'', whatever the nature of the resistance. If the solution is generated by creativity, it is equally important to take it to the market in a creative and innovative way. In this dimension there is nothing that really differs from the generic entrepreneurial description I subscribe to, but this comes natural since sustainopreneurship is a conceptual extension and development from the social phenomenon named entrepreneurship, and thus inherits one of its perceived key dimensions, 'entrepreneurship as creative organizing'.&lt;ref name="ftn19"&gt;Johannisson, B. (2005), Ibid.&lt;/ref&gt; The market is used as well, not society primarily, since it implies business establishment – a sustainability business that still knows its place and role in the holarchy mentioned earlier. Bringing something to the market at the same time brings it to society and our shared physical environment.

'''3. Sustainopreneurship in process adds sustainability value with respect for life support systems '''

:The awareness that the (economic) market is an embedded sub-system in the "socio-sphere" that is in turn a part of the 'bio-sphere' is made explicit. This awareness naturally and self-evidently makes the sustainopreneurial team maximize harmony with life support systems in the process. With joy and pride the epitome of the generic definition of "sustainable development" lives in business venturing. In short – living the generic definition of sustainable development as defined by WCED,&lt;ref name="ftn18"&gt;UN, World Commission on Environment and Development (1987) Our Common Future, Oxford, Oxford University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; with respect to the needs of present and future stakeholders, keeping the holistic world-view and making it guide everyday (inter)action. 

===Sustainable vs. sustainability entrepreneurship===
With these dimensions clarified and distinctions made a common conceptual vagueness or lack of clarity needs to be addressed, where a strong need to distinguish clearly between sustainable, vs. ''sustainability'' entrepreneurship is identified. From this point of view, a very important distinction with the concept formed is claimed – ''sustainability'' entrepreneurship as in the concept ''sustainopreneurship; ''the use of entrepreneurial activity in a ''determined action orientation towards solving a sustainability-related problem'' with (creative) business organizing as a ''means'' to solve the problem(s) – '''business with a cause''': to turn business activity from a part of the problem to a part of the solution.'' Sustainable'' entrepreneurship is just a generic entrepreneurial process that takes into consideration the boundaries set by sustainability, and does not address where to and why, the destination, the purpose or the aim of the venture. The strategic intent and the business idea in itself are not related to sustainability ''per se,'' sustainability just being an "attachment" to the entrepreneurial process. The second and third dimensions are represented, but not the first. ''Sustainability'' entrepreneurship, in contrast, takes as its root of existence and strategic aim to solve a sustainability-related problem. This means that all three dimensions are simultaneously present: to take a sustainability innovation to the market through creative organizing with respect for life-supporting systems in the process.

== Future development ==

Given its recent date, there is a need for future research, as mentioned above.&lt;ref name="ftn12"&gt;Abrahamsson, A. (2007b), Researching Sustainopreneurship – conditions, concepts, approaches, arenas and questions. An invitation to authentic sustainability business forces. Paper presented at the 13th International Sustainable Development Research Conference, Mälardalens Högskola, Västerås, 10-12 June, 2007&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ftn13"/&gt; Main findings here are that conceptually, a deeper analysis is needed to be conducted with a nuanced and detailed taxonomy and framework created of sustainability innovations, the core of sustainopreneurship, primarily by cataloging and categorizing case stories. It is also needed to make a more detailed description to relate sustainopreneurship to other concepts in the wider, general idea-sphere of the "business case of sustainability", in the contemporary plethora of "buzz-words", approaches, methods and acronyms that already exists – and in this context also to motivate why this concept adds value. 

It has been recommended, though, to keep the research applied, to identify obstacles and institutional barriers, and how to overcome them; i. e. facilitating factors for sustainopreneurship, researching prospective tools, enablers and approaches. Appropriate areas and domains for sustainopreneurship applied are recommended to be digested. Research methods recommended are [[Enactive Research]]&lt;ref name="ftn9"&gt;Johannisson, B. (2002) Enacting Entrepreneurship – Using Auto-Ethnography to Study Organization Creation, Paper presented the conference ''Ethnographic Organizational Studies'', University of St. Gallen, Switzerland, September 19-21, 2002. &lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ftn10"&gt;Johannisson, B. (2005) Entreprenörskapets väsen, Lund: Studentlitteratur.&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Open Space Technology]], since they add instant value among stakeholders, and in themselves naturally builds arenas where sustainopreneurship evolves and proliferates. For progress, beyond these "how"-related pointers, the key is to single out "the big questions", getting answers through collaborative, collective dialogue and conversation, with an explicit interaction and results orientation. Issues and topics have been formulated and outlined, where it is of striking importance with an intention to attract authentic forces potentially hearing this call of exploring the phenomenon further, with the purpose to collapse the degrees of separation in between the stakeholders of the sustainopreneurial concept – in idea, reflective practice and applied interaction to generate collective and collaborative wisdom for a deeper understanding of the concept. An association with this purpose is in its interim stages, ÆREAS(i).

'''Terminal Tower''' is a 52-story, {{convert|235|m|abbr=on}}, landmark [[skyscraper]] located on [[Public Square, Cleveland|Public Square]] in [[downtown Cleveland]], [[Ohio]], United States. Built during the skyscraper boom of the 1920s and 1930s, it was the [[List of tallest buildings in the world|second-tallest building in the world]] when it was completed. Terminal Tower stood as the tallest building in [[North America]] outside of [[New York City]] from its completion in 1930 until 1964.  It was the tallest building in the state of Ohio until the completion of [[Key Tower]] in 1991, and remains the [[List of tallest buildings in Ohio|second-tallest building in the state]].  The building is part of the [[Tower City Center]] mixed-use development, and its major tenants include [[Forest City Enterprises]], former owner of the building, which maintained its corporate headquarters there until 2018, and [[Riverside Company]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.forestcity.net/properties/work/office_buildings/Pages/terminal_tower.aspx |title=Terminal Tower |accessdate=2010-09-29 |publisher=[[Forest City Enterprises]] |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150912045303/http://www.forestcity.net/properties/work/office_buildings/Pages/terminal_tower.aspx |archivedate=2015-09-12 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Ownership==
The tower, owned by Forest City Realty Trust since 1983, was purchased by Cleveland's K&amp;D Management, LLC September 15, 2016 for $38.5 million. K&amp;D plans to add a mixed-use element to the building, converting 12 of the lower, larger floors to residential use, with 293 one and two bedroom apartments. Many older downtown Cleveland office buildings are undergoing similar conversions. The largest privately held owner/manager of apartment buildings in the area, K&amp;D will maintain the upper floors of the building as office space. Construction is planned to start in 2018, with a completion date of 2020.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Jarboe|first1=Michelle|title=Terminal Tower sold to K&amp;D Management, LLC in $38.5 million deal; apartments planned for 12 floors|url=http://realestate.cleveland.com/realestate-news/2016/09/terminal_tower_sold_to_kd_grou.html|accessdate=10 November 2016|work=The Plain Dealer|publisher=AdvanceOhio|date=15 September 2016|location=Cleveland Ohio}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Architecture==
Built for [[United States dollar|$]]179 million by the [[Van Sweringen brothers]], the tower was to serve as an office building atop the city's new [[train station|rail station]], the [[Cleveland Union Terminal]].  Originally planned to be 14 stories, the structure was expanded to 52 floors with a height of {{convert|708|ft|m}}. It rests on {{convert|280|ft|m|adj=on}} caissons.  Designed by the firm of [[Graham, Anderson, Probst &amp; White]], the tower was modeled after the [[Beaux-Arts architecture|Beaux-Arts]] [[New York Municipal Building]] by [[McKim, Mead, and White]]. The Terminal Tower opened for tenants in 1928, though the Union Terminal complex wasn't dedicated until 1930.

It remained the tallest building in the world outside of [[New York City]] until the completion of the main building of [[Moscow State University]] in [[Moscow]] in 1953; it was the tallest building in [[North America]] outside of New York until the [[Prudential Tower|Prudential Center]] in [[Boston, Massachusetts]], was completed in 1964.

Radio station [[WHK (AM)|WHK]] placed [[antenna (radio)|antennas]] on the building to increase the range of its 1420&amp;nbsp;kHz signal.

In the 1980s, developers sought approval to make their proposed [[BP Building]] taller than the Terminal Tower, but city officials forced them to scale it down. The Terminal Tower remained the tallest building in Ohio until the 1991 completion of Society Center, now Key Tower.

===Observation deck===
On a clear day, visitors on the observation deck can see {{convert|30|mi|km}} from downtown Cleveland.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://travel.yahoo.com/p-travelguide-2541288-cleveland_tours-i |title=Cleveland Recommended Tours |accessdate=2008-06-15 |publisher=Yahoo! Travel}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On August 26, 1976, gunman Ashby Leach stormed a [[Chessie System]] conference room on the 42nd floor.&lt;ref name=TurningPoint&gt;{{cite book|last=Hunt|first=Andrew E. |authorlink= Andrew Hunt (historian) |title=The Turning: A History of Vietnam Veterans Against the War |date= 2001-05-01, copyright 1999 |publisher= [[New York University|New York University Press]] |isbn=978-0-8147-3581-7|oclc=40848421|pages=182–183|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=3AhGjLUf8SYC&amp;lpg=PA183&amp;dq=%22Ashby%20Leach%22&amp;pg=PA183#v=onepage&amp;q=%22Ashby%20Leach%22&amp;f=false|accessdate=2010-09-28 |laysummary= http://best-websites-to-download-free-ebooks.blogspot.com/2011/02/turning-history-of-vietnam-veterans.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Leach, who was disgruntled with [[Chessie System]]'s decision not to pay into a G.I. Bill fund that would have increased his wages and benefits during his apprenticeship with the company, held 13 hostages before his arrest.&lt;ref name=TurningPoint/&gt;  He was jailed for three months pending trial, then was acquitted of kidnapping and convicted of assault, extortion, and carrying an illegal weapon.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Joy|first=Ted|title=The Siege of Terminal Tower|journal=Mother Jones Magazine|date=June 1977|pages=21–25, 58–59|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=qeYDAAAAMBAJ&amp;lpg=PA59&amp;dq=%22Ashby%20Leach%22&amp;pg=PA21#v=onepage&amp;q=%22Ashby%20Leach%22&amp;f=false|accessdate=28 September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Upon his release, he embarked on a speaking tour for the group [[Vietnam Veterans Against the War]].&lt;ref name=TurningPoint/&gt;  After the hostage incident, direct access to the floor was removed. The observation deck reopened after Chessie left the building.

After the [[September 11, 2001 attacks]], the observation deck was again closed to the public.  In 2007, a proposal was brought to Forest City to reopen the deck. The proposal included a renovation of the deck and the addition of an express elevator to take visitors to it. This was to be done after the upper floors were renovated and the scaffolding removed. In 2010, Forest City Enterprises finished renovating the complex's elevators, upper floors, and spire. The observation deck reopened on July 10, 2010&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=John |last=Petkovic |coauthors= |title=Terminal Tower observation deck reopens to the public |url=http://www.cleveland.com/goingout/index.ssf/2010/07/terminal_tower_observation_dec.html |work=[[The Plain Dealer]] |publisher= |date=2010-07-09 |accessdate=2010-07-11 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Lynn |last=Ischay |coauthors= |title=Gallery: Terminal Tower observation deck reopens  |url=http://photos.cleveland.com/4501/gallery/terminal_tower_observation_deck_reopens/index.html |work=[[The Plain Dealer]] |publisher= |date=2010-07-11 |accessdate=2010-07-13 }}&lt;/ref&gt; for a limited period, with plans to expand public access.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Robert L. |last=Smith |coauthors= |title=Hundreds savor the view and the memories from Terminal Tower's observation deck |url=http://blog.cleveland.com/metro/2010/08/hundreds_savor_the_view_and_th.html |work=[[The Plain Dealer]] |publisher= |date=2010-08-01 |accessdate=2010-08-21 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"[http://downtowncleveland.org/blog/index.php/2010/06/terminal-tower-observation-deck-to-open-this-summer/ Terminal Tower Observation Deck to open this Summer] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100724022601/http://downtowncleveland.org/blog/index.php/2010/06/terminal-tower-observation-deck-to-open-this-summer |date=2010-07-24 }}". ''Downtown Cleveland Alliance'', 2010-06-28.&lt;/ref&gt;

To reach the observation deck, visitors take the elevator to the 32nd floor and then transfer to another elevator to reach the 42nd floor. Before its original closure, the deck was open only on weekends to prevent disruption to the law firm that has offices on the 32nd floor.

==External lighting==
[[file:Terminal Tower in rainbow colors.jpg|left|240px|thumb|The tower lit up in rainbow colors in honor of Cleveland hosting the 2014 [[Gay Games]] in August 2014.]]
The Terminal Tower was lit when it opened in 1930. A [[strobe light]] on top of the tower rotated 360 degrees. It helped ships in Cleveland's port and airplane pilots landing at [[Cleveland Hopkins International Airport]].

The external spotlights that lit the tower at night were turned off as a safety measure at the beginning of World War II. They were not turned on again until September 22, 1974. They were relit on the same day that the annual Greater Cleveland United Torch Drive (a precursor to the [[United Way of America|United Way]]) began. Lights were installed on the 44th, 48th, and 52nd floors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Miller|first=William F.|title=New Buildings Keep Changing Downtown Skyline|work=The Plain Dealer|date=September 22, 1974|pages=A1, AA1}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the 1960s, the strobe was retired and replaced with conventional [[aircraft warning lights]]. The tower only once went dark, during the [[Northeast Blackout of 2003|2003 blackout]].

Today, the tower's external lights include 508 [[light-emitting diode|LEDs]] that can be configured into various color schemes, such as red and green during the [[Christmas]] season and red, white, and blue for various federal holidays.&lt;ref&gt;[http://origin.wkyc.com/news/article/311310/15/High-tech-lights-help-Terminal-Tower-tweet-its-lights Terminal Tower lights - WKYC.com] {{Webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20141010170615/http://origin.wkyc.com/news/article/311310/15/High-tech-lights-help-Terminal-Tower-tweet-its-lights |date=2014-10-10 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.towercitycleveland.com/info/lighting Terminal Tower lighting - Tower City Cleveland.com]&lt;/ref&gt;

Many Cleveland social and medical groups light Terminal Tower for their causes. In February, Terminal Tower is red for the [[American Heart Association]] Go Red for Women campaign, and pink for Breast Cancer Awareness month in October. Some of Cleveland's ethnic groups have had the Terminal Tower lit in their traditional colors, such as green on [[Saint Patrick's Day]]. On Polish Constitution Day, usually May 3, Cleveland's Pol-Am community lights the tower in white and red (Polish flag colors), and the tower goes red, green, and white (Italian flag colors) for [[Columbus Day]].

Terminal Tower also sports the colors of the various sports teams in town, such as red, white, and blue for the [[Cleveland Indians]], orange and brown for the [[Cleveland Browns]], and wine and gold for the [[Cleveland Cavaliers]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://twitter.com/TowerLightsCle/status/558036577944080385 Terminal Tower in wine and gold - Twitter.com]&lt;/ref&gt; During the 2014 [[Gay Games]], the tower was lit in a rainbow pattern (representing the gay pride flag).&lt;ref&gt;[http://photos.cleveland.com/plain-dealer/2013/01/terminal_tower_lighted_in_rain.html Terminal Tower photos - Cleveland.com]&lt;/ref&gt;  In January 2015, Terminal Tower was lit in scarlet and gray in support of the [[Ohio State Buckeyes]] during the football team's National Championship run as Cleveland has a large OSU fan and alumni base.&lt;ref&gt;[https://twitter.com/TowerLightsCLE/status/554581658083794944 Terminal Tower in scarlet and grey - Twitter.com]&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6292">{{nihongo|'''Unemployment insurance'''|雇用保険|koyou hoken}}, also known as  {{nihongo|失業保険|shitsugyou hoken}} is the "user pays" system of [[unemployment benefits]] that operate in Japan. It is paired with {{nihongo|[[Workers' Accident Compensation Insurance (Japan)|Workers' Accident Compensation Insurance]]|労働者災害補償保険|rousai hoken}} and referred to collectively as {{nihongo|[[Labor Insurance (Japan)|Labor insurance]]|労働保険|roudou hoken}}.&lt;ref&gt;JETRO website [http://www.jetro.go.jp/en/invest/setting_up/laws/section4/page9.html 4.9.1 Labor and social insurance systems] Retrieved on June 16, 2012&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;National Institute of Population and Social Security Research [http://www.ipss.go.jp/s-info/e/ssj2014/009.html] Retrieved on November 24, 2014&lt;/ref&gt; It is managed by [[Hello Work]].

==System==
Japanese unemployment insurance is closer to the [[Unemployment benefits#United States|US]] or [[Unemployment benefits#Canada|Canadian]] "user pays" system than the taxpayer funded systems in place in countries such as the [[Unemployment benefits#United Kingdom|United Kingdom]], [[Unemployment benefits#New Zealand|New Zealand]], or [[Unemployment benefits#Australia|Australia]]. It is paid for by contributions by both the employer and employee.&lt;ref&gt;Tokyo Employment Service Center for Foreigners website [http://tokyo-foreigner.jsite.mhlw.go.jp/english/seekers_1/spec/spec_1d.html For foreign nationals working in Japan] Retrieved on November 24, 2014&lt;/ref&gt;

==Requirements==
Workers enrolling in unemployment insurance must be working at least 20 hours per week, and to expect to be employed for at least 31 days. Employees who are dispatched to Japan from overseas and who already have coverage in a similar scheme are not required to enroll in Japanese unemployment insurance.&lt;ref&gt;JETRO website [http://www.jetro.go.jp/en/invest/setting_up/laws/section4/page9.html 4.9.1 Labor and social insurance systems] Retrieved on June 16, 2012&lt;/ref&gt;

==Procedures==
On leaving a job, employees are supposed to be given a "Rishoku-hyo" document showing their ID number (the same number is supposed to be used by later employers), employment periods, and pay (which contributions are linked to). The reason for leaving is also documented separately.

==Premiums==
Premiums are calculated as a certain percentage of each worker's total wage. Under the latest revision in April 2016, the insurance premium rate is 1.10% (the employer paying 0.7% and the worker paying 0.4%) with the exception of a few kinds of jobs.&lt;ref&gt;JETRO website [https://www.jetro.go.jp/en/invest/setting_up/laws/section4/page9.html Laws &amp; Regulations on Setting Up Business in Japan  - Section 4. Human Resource Management] &lt;/ref&gt;

==Payments==
The circumstances under which an employee left their position affect eligibility, timing, and amount of benefits.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.justlanded.com/english/Japan/Japan-Guide/Jobs/Employment-insurance Unemployment benefits in Japan]&lt;/ref&gt; The length of time that unemployed workers can receive benefits depends on the age of the employee, and how long they have been employed and paying in.&lt;ref&gt;National Institute of Population and Social Security Research [http://www.ipss.go.jp/s-info/e/ssj2014/pdf/Table9_5.pdf Table 9.5 Outline of the Employment Insurance System in Japan] Retrieved on November 24, 2014&lt;/ref&gt;

It is supposed to be compulsory for most full-time employees.&lt;ref&gt;International Labour Organization [http://www.ilo.org/dyn/natlex/docs/ELECTRONIC/27771/103404/F-1268072768/JPN27771%202007.pdf Employment Insurance Law (Japan) - PDF of Act as amended to Act No. 30 of 2007] Retrieved on November 24, 2014&lt;/ref&gt; If they have been enrolled for at least six months and are fired or made redundant, leave the company at the end of their contract, or their contract is non-renewed, the now-unemployed worker will receive unemployment insurance. If a worker quit of their own accord they may have to wait between one and three months before receiving any payment.

== Rates ==
In July 2016 Japan's unemployment rate was 3%.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/business-37218507|title=Japanese unemployment rate hits two-decade low|date=2016-08-30|newspaper=BBC News|language=en-GB|access-date=2016-12-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; Japan's unemployment rate has remained relatively low over the years.

'''William Street''' is a street in the [[Financial District, Manhattan|Financial District]] of [[Lower Manhattan|Lower]] [[Manhattan]], [[New York City]]. It runs generally southwest to northeast, crossing [[Wall Street]] and terminating at [[Broad Street (Manhattan)|Broad Street]] and [[Spruce Street (Manhattan)|Spruce Street]], respectively.  Between Beaver Street and Broad Street, the street is known as '''South William Street'''. Between Beekman Street and Spruce Street, in front of [[New York Downtown Hospital]], William Street is pedestrian-only.

== History ==

[[File:New York, corner between Wall Street and William Street 1798.png|thumb|right|250px|View of the northeast corner of William and Wall streets. The house to the far right became [[City Bank of New York]]'s first home at 38 Wall Street, later re-numbered as №52. (Painting by [[Archibald Robertson (painter)|Archibald Robertson]], c. 1798)]]

It is one of the oldest streets in Manhattan and can be seen in the 1660 [[Castello Plan]] of [[New Amsterdam]]. It was originally called King Street, but was later renamed William after [[Wilhelmus Beekman|Willem Beekman]] who arrived in [[New Amsterdam]] in 1647 as a fellow passenger of [[Peter Stuyvesant]]. Beekman got his start as a [[Dutch West India Company]] clerk and later served nine terms as mayor of the young port city.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Street Book: An encyclopedia of Manhattan's Street Names and Their Origins |author=Henry Moscow |publisher= Fordham University Press, 1979 |page= 113 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The buildings on South William Street 13-23 were reconstructed in the Dutch revival style by architect [[C. P. H. Gilbert]] and later [[Edward L. Tilton]] in the early 1900s, evoking New Amsterdam with the use of red brick as building material and the features of [[stepped gable]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2012/12/30/realestate/streetscapes-on-south-william-street-a-nod-to-new-amsterdam.html|title=Streetscapes — On South William Street, a Nod to New Amsterdam|last=Gray|first=Christopher|date=2012-12-27|newspaper=The New York Times|issn=0362-4331|access-date=2016-12-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; The area was declared a historic district in 1996 by the [[New York City Landmarks Preservation Commission]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.nyc.gov/html/lpc/downloads/pdf/reports/STONE_STREET_HISTORIC_DISTRICT.pdf|title=Stone Street Historic District|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=New York City Landmarks Preservation Commission|access-date=2016-12-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;
