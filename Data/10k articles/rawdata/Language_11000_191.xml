The ''''Are'are''' language is spoken by the [['Are'are people]] of the [[Solomon Islands]]. It is spoken by about 18,000 people, making it the second-largest [[Oceanic language]] in the Solomons after the [[Kwara'ae language|Kwara'ae]] (also from Malaita). The [[literacy rate]] for 'Are'are is somewhere between 30% and 60%&lt;ref name=e18/&gt; for [[first language]] speakers, and 25%–50% for [[second language]] learners. There are also translated [[Bible]] portions into the language from 1957–2008.&lt;ref name=e18/&gt;

== Geographic Distribution ==

The language is spoken mainly by the [['Are'are people]], on the southern part of [[Malaita]] island, as well as nearby [[South Malaita Island]] and the eastern shore of [[Guadalcanal]] (the [[Marau Sound]], 60&amp;nbsp;km away), in the [[Solomon Islands]] archipelago. The speakers live as hunters and agriculturalists.&lt;ref name=e18/&gt;

=== Dialects ===

The language is divided into two dialects, 'Are'are proper and Marau, spoken at Marau Sound in eastern Guadalcanal. Marau is sometimes counted as a separate language.

'''Adolf Bernhard Philipp Reinach''' (23 December 1883 – 16 November 1917) was a German philosopher, phenomenologist (from the [[Munich phenomenology]] school) and law theorist.

==Life and work==
Adolf Reinach was born into a prominent Jewish family in [[Mainz]],&lt;ref name=reinach&gt;{{cite book|title=Speech Act and Sachverhalt: Reinach and the Foundations of Realist Phenomenology. Adolf Reinach: An Intellectual Biography|year=1987|publisher=Nijhoff|location=Dordrecht|url=http://ontology.buffalo.edu/smith/book/Reinach/Reinach_Biography.pdf|author=Karl Schuhmann|author2=Barry Smith|editor=K.

Adolf Reinach studied at the ''[[ Rabanus-Maurus-Gymnasium|Ostergymnasium]]'' in Mainz (where he became at first interested in Plato) and later entered the [[University of Munich]] in 1901 where he studied mainly [[psychology]] and [[philosophy]] under [[Theodor Lipps]]. In the circle of Lipps' students he came in contact with [[Moritz Geiger]], [[Otto Selz]], [[Aloys Fischer]] and above all [[Johannes Daubert]]. From onward 1903/4 he was increasingly busy with the works of [[Edmund Husserl]], especially his ''Logische Untersuchungen'' (Logical Investigations).

In 1904, Reinach obtained his doctorate in philosophy under Lipps with his work ''Über den Ursachenbegriff im geltenden Strafrecht'' (On the concept of cause in penal law). In 1905, he still intended to continue his studies in Munich (where in the meanwhile he had also befriended [[Alexander Pfänder]]), to obtain a degree in law, but then decided to go to study with Husserl in [[Göttingen]]. In that period more students of Lipps (captained by Daubert) had decided to abandon Munich and to head for Göttingen, inspired by Husserl's works (which is referred to as the [[Munich invasion of Göttingen]]).

Later in 1905 Reinach returned to Munich to complete his studies in law and then continued in 1906-1907 in [[Tübingen]]. He attended several lectures and seminars on penal law by the legal theorist [[Ernst Beling]], by which he was quite impressed and to which he owes a great deal of inspiration of his later works. In the summer of 1907 he took the First State Examination in Law, but also went later to Göttingen to attend discussion circles with Husserl.

With the support of Husserl, Reinach was able to obtain habilitation for university teaching at Göttingen in 1909. From his lectures and research, we can see that at the time he was influenced also by [[Anton Marty]] and [[Johannes Daubert]], besides obviously and greatly by Husserl. On his turn Reinach appears to have inspired several young phenomenologists (like [[Wilhelm Schapp]], [[Dietrich von Hildebrand]], [[Alexandre Koyré]] and [[Edith Stein]]) with his lectures. Besides giving an introduction to phenomenology, he lectured i.a. on [[Plato]] and [[Immanuel Kant]].

In this period, Husserl embarked on a thorough revision of his main work, the ''Logical Investigations'', and asked Reinach’s assistance in this endeavour. Moreover, in 1912 Reinach, together with [[Moritz Geiger]] and [[Alexander Pfänder]] founded the famous ''Jahrbuch für Philosophie und phänomenologische Forschung'', with [[Edmund Husserl|Husserl]] as main editor.

Besides his work in the area of phenomenology and philosophy in general, Reinach is credited for the development of a forerunner to the theory of [[speech act]]s by [[J. L. Austin|Austin]] and [[John Searle|Searle]]: ''Die apriorischen Grundlagen des bürgerlichen  Rechtes'' ([[The A Priori Foundations of Civil Law]]) is a systematic treatment of social acts as [[performative utterances]] and ''a priori'' foundations of civil law. Reinach's work was based mostly on Husserl's analysis of meaning in the ''Logical Investigations'', but also on Daubert's criticism of it. [[Alexander Pfänder]] (1870–1941) had also been doing research on commands, promises and the like in the same period.

After Husserl's publication of the ''Ideen'' (Ideas) in 1913, many phenomenologists took a critical stance towards his new theories and the current of [[Munich phenomenology]] came effectively into being, as Reinach, Daubert and others chose to remain closer to Husserl's earlier work, the ''Logical investigations''. Instead of following Husserl into idealism and transcendental phenomenology, the Munich group remained a realist current.

Reinach was converted to [[Lutheranism]] along with his wife&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.baltimorecarmel.org/saints/Stein/evelyn_waugh's%20book%20review.htm |title=A 1952 book review by Evelyn Waugh of a biography of Edith Stein by Sister Teresia de Spiritu Sancto, ODC |access-date=3 July 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170905005413/http://www.baltimorecarmel.org/saints/Stein/evelyn_waugh's%20book%20review.htm |archive-date=5 September 2017 |dead-url=yes |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.vatican.va/news_services/liturgy/saints/ns_lit_doc_19981011_edith_stein_en.html Teresa Benedict of the Cross Edith Stein (1891-1942)]&lt;/ref&gt;

At the outbreak of [[World War I]] Reinach volunteered to join the army. After many battles and having received the [[Iron Cross]], Reinach fell outside Diksmuide in Flanders on 16 November 1917.

'''Anna Maria Angelika Jansson''' (born 13 February 1958) is a Swedish [[crime writer]] and nurse from [[Visby]], [[Gotland]]. She started her career as a surgeon nurse, but soon went over to the lung clinic due to her frequent fainting from seeing blood.&lt;ref name="E24"/&gt;

Jansson began writing novels in 1997 after her family bought a computer.&lt;ref name="HK"/&gt; At this time she had worked as a nurse for twenty years, and although she still enjoyed her occupation, she felt it was time to try something new.&lt;ref name="E24"/&gt; Jansson commented: "In school I hated writing essays, but then we got a computer at home, and suddenly I discovered that I actually felt happy as I was writing."&lt;ref name="E24"/&gt; A contributing factor to Jansson's decision to pursue her career as an author was her patients; she often met patients that were about to die and she was told that they regretted the fact that they had not spent much time in life doing what they really wanted.&lt;ref name="E24"/&gt;

The inspiration for Jansson's novels, which deal with crimes, came from the patients she met in her job as a nurse.&lt;ref name="E24"/&gt; Jansson's first crime novel to be published was ''Stum sitter guden'' in 2000. She had written two novels prior to this one, but failed to find a publisher for them.&lt;ref name="HK"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.hallekis.com/xx090409c.htm|title=Världsbokdagen firas med besök av deckarförfattaren Anna Jansson |date=2009-04-09|work=Hällekis-Kuriren|language=Swedish|accessdate=2009-12-21|location=[[Hällekis]]}} {{Dead link|date=October 2010|bot=H3llBot}}&lt;/ref&gt; Jansson did not give up on her career as a nurse, and continued to work [[part-time]] at the [[Örebro]] Hospital while writing in her free time.&lt;ref name="E24"/&gt; Since 2000, she has published at least one novel each year. Her latest ones have sold over 100,000 copies each.&lt;ref name="E24"/&gt; In addition to this, Jansson has written a number of [[children's book]]s.&lt;ref name="E24"/&gt;

Jansson's crime novels take place in Gotland and the main character in all of them is criminal inspector Maria Wern.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.dalademokraten.se/ArticlePages/200405/14/1000179247_TT/1000179247_TT.dbp.asp |title=Mord i gotländsk sommarnatt |date=2004-05-14 |work=[[Dala-Demokraten]] |language=Swedish |accessdate=2009-12-21 |location=Falun |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110719093040/http://www.dalademokraten.se/ArticlePages/200405/14/1000179247_TT/1000179247_TT.dbp.asp |archivedate=2011-07-19 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Gotland"/&gt; Her 2006 novel ''Främmande fågel'' was nominated for a [[Glass Key award]] in 2007,&lt;ref name="Gotland"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.gotland.net/sv/bo-leva/arkiv/2007/anna-jansson-arets-kandidat-till-glasnyckeln |title=Anna Jansson årets kandidat till Glasnyckeln |date=2007-03-27 |publisher=Gotland.net |language=Swedish |accessdate=2009-12-21 |location=[[Visby]] |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110723140812/http://www.gotland.net/sv/bo-leva/arkiv/2007/anna-jansson-arets-kandidat-till-glasnyckeln |archivedate=2011-07-23 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; and was adapted into a television show by [[TV4 (Sweden)|TV4]] in 2008.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://sydsvenskan.se/kultur-och-nojen/article251522.ece |title=Anna Janssons deckare blir tv-serie |last=Redvall |first=Eva |date=2007-07-13 |work=[[Sydsvenskan]] |language=Swedish |accessdate=2009-12-21 |location=[[Malmö]] |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091224084014/http://sydsvenskan.se/kultur-och-nojen/article251522.ece |archivedate=2009-12-24 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Border''' or '''Upper Tami'''&lt;ref&gt;Cowan (1957) tentatively proposed a "Tami" family, named after the [[Tami River]], that included the modern Border and [[Sko languages|Sko]] language families.  Some of the previously unclassified languages did turn out to be Sko, and were added to that family; the remainder (including the languages of the upper Tami) constitute the Border family.&lt;/ref&gt; languages are an independent [[language family|family]] of [[Papuan languages]] in [[Malcolm Ross (linguist)|Malcolm Ross]]'s version of the [[Trans–New Guinea languages|Trans–New Guinea]] proposal. They are named after the Indonesia – Papua New Guinea border, which they span.

==Classification==

* ''[[Morwap language|Morwap]]'' (Elseng) 
* ''[[Senggi language|Senggi]]'' (Viid)
* '''Taikat''' (Upper Tami): [[Awyi language|Awyi]], [[Taikat language|Taikat]]

**Bapi River: [[Amanab language|Amanab]], [[Auwe-Daonda language|Auwe-Daonda]], [[Imonda language|Imonda]], [[Sowanda language|Sowanda]] (Punda, Umeda, Waina), [[Waris language|Waris]]

There is also [[Ningera language|Ningera]]. 

Laycock classified Morwap as an isolate, but noted pronominal similarities with Border. Ross included Morwap in Border but noted that they do not appear to share any lexical similarities. However, his Morwap data were quite poor. Usher included it as a branch of Border.

==Pronouns==
The pronouns that Ross reconstructs for proto-Border are the following:

:{| class=wikitable

'''Chemmanam Chacko''' (March 7, 1926 – August 14, 2018) was an Indian satirical poet from [[Kerala]], [[India]]. He died on 15 August 2018 at the age of 92 at his residence in [[Padamugal]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/chemmanam-chacko-dead/article24694006.ece|title=Chemmanam Chacko dead|last=Bureau|first=Kochi|date=2018-08-15|work=The Hindu|access-date=15 August 2018|language=en-IN|issn=0971-751X}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Early life ==
Chacko was born on 7 March 1926, in the village of [[Mulakulam]] in erstwhile [[Travancore]]. His father was an [[Priest#Christianity|Orthodox Christian priest]]. He did his early schooling in Saint Joseph's school, [[Piravom]], and went on to receive his BA honours in [[Malayalam literature]] with first rank from [[University College, Trivandrum]]. He worked as a professor at [[Mar Ivanios College]] and the Department of Malayalam, [[University of Kerala]].

== Poetry ==

Chacko's first published poem was 'Munnottu' (Forward) which appeared in a local weekly in 1946. The poem 'Kanakaaksharangal' published in 1967 brought him popularity. Chemmanam is famed for efficiently utilising [[satire]] in his poems as a means of social and political critique.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.hindu.com/2010/04/09/stories/2010040953910400.htm| title=A war of verse | location=Chennai, India | work=The Hindu| date=9 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; His poetic style has often drawn comparison to the early Malayalam language poet [[Kunjan Nambiar]]. His 1977 poetry collection ''Rajapatha'' won the [[Kerala Sahitya Akademi Award]]. He was conferred with the lifetime achievement award for literature by the [[Kerala Sahitya Akademi]] in 2006. He received the Mahakavi Pandalam Keralavarma Award for Poetry in 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.hindu.com/2006/03/15/stories/2006031503760200.htm| title=Honour for a poet's lifetime work | location=Chennai, India | work=The Hindu| date=15 March 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Videosignal colorburst.jpg|200px|right|thumb|Horizontal sync and color burst of PAL videosignal]]

'''Colorburst''' is an [[analog video]], [[composite video]] signal generated by a [[video-signal generator]] used to keep the [[chrominance subcarrier]] synchronized in a [[color television]] signal. By synchronizing an [[oscillator]] with the colorburst at the [[back porch]] (beginning) of each [[scan line]], a television receiver is able to restore the suppressed carrier of the [[chrominance]] (color) signals, and in turn decode the color information. The most common use of colorburst is to [[genlock]]  equipment together as a common reference with a [[vision mixer]] in a [[television studio]] using a [[multi-camera setup]].

== Explanation ==

In [[NTSC]], its frequency is exactly 315/88&amp;nbsp;= 3.579{{Overline|54}}{{Efn|name=repeating decimal|[[Repeating decimal#Notation|Repeating decimal notation]]}}&amp;nbsp;[[MHz]] with a phase of 180°. [[PAL]] uses a frequency of exactly 4.43361875&amp;nbsp;MHz, with its phase alternating between 135° and 225° from line to line. Since the colorburst signal has a known amplitude, it is sometimes used as a reference level when compensating for amplitude variations in the overall signal.

[[SECAM]] is unique in not having a colorburst signal, since the chrominance signals are encoded using [[Frequency modulation|FM]] rather than [[QAM]], thus the signal phase is immaterial and no reference point is needed.

== Rationale for NTSC Color burst frequency ==
{{Details|NTSC#Color encoding}}

The original black and white NTSC television standard specified a frame rate of 30&amp;nbsp;Hz and 525 lines per frame, or 15750 lines per second. The audio was frequency modulated 4.5&amp;nbsp;MHz above the video signal.  Because this was black and white, the video consisted only of luminance (brightness) information. Although all of the space in between was occupied, the line-based nature of the video information meant that the luminance data was not spread uniformly across the [[frequency domain]]; it was concentrated at multiples of the line rate. Plotting the video signal on a [[spectrogram]] gave a signature that looked like the teeth of a comb or a gear, rather than smooth and uniform.

[[RCA]] discovered&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Brown and Luck|first=|date=June 1953|title=PRINCIPLES AND DEVELOPMENT OF COLOR TELEVISION SYSTEMS|url=http://www.americanradiohistory.com/ARCHIVE-RCA/RCA-Review/RCA-Review-1953-June.pdf|journal=RCA Review|volume=XIV|pages=155-156|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; that if the [[chrominance]] (color) information, which had a similar spectrum, was modulated on a carrier that was a [[half-integer]] multiple of the line rate, its signal peaks would fit neatly between the peaks of the luminance data and interference was minimized. It was not eliminated, but what remained was not readily apparent to human eyes. (Modern televisions attempt to reduce this interference further using a [[comb filter]].)

To provide sufficient bandwidth for the chrominance signal, yet interfere only with the highest-frequency (and thus least perceptible) portions of the luminance signal, a chrominance subcarrier near 3.6&amp;nbsp;MHz was desirable. 227.5&amp;nbsp;= 455/2 times the line rate was close to the right number, and 455's small factors (5&amp;nbsp;× 7&amp;nbsp;× 13) make a divider easy to construct.

However, additional interference could come from the [[audio signal]]. To minimize interference there, it was similarly desirable to make the distance between the chrominance [[carrier frequency]] and the audio carrier frequency a half-integer multiple of the line rate. The sum of these two half-integers implies that the distance between the frequency of the luminance carrier and audio carrier must be an integer multiple of the line rate. However, the original NTSC standard, with a 4.5&amp;nbsp;MHz carrier spacing and a 15750&amp;nbsp;Hz line rate, did not meet this requirement: the audio was 285.714 times the line rate.

While existing black and white receivers could not decode a signal with a different audio carrier frequency, they could easily use the copious timing information in the video signal to decode a slightly slower line rate.  Thus, the new color television standard reduced the line rate by a factor of 1.001 to 1/286 of the 4.5&amp;nbsp;MHz audio subcarrier frequency, or about 15734.2657&amp;nbsp;Hz. This reduced the frame rate to 30/1.001&amp;nbsp;≈ 29.9700&amp;nbsp;Hz, and placed the color subcarrier at 227.5/286 = 455/572 = 35/44 of the 4.5&amp;nbsp;MHz audio subcarrier.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.antiqueradio.org/art/NTSC%20Signal%20Specifications.pdf|title=NTSC SIGNAL SPECIFICATIONS|last=|first=|date=23 May 2018|website=Antique Radio.org|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Crystals ==

An NTSC or PAL television's color decoder contains a colorburst [[crystal oscillator]].

Because so many analog color TVs [[analog switchoff|were produced]] from the 1960s to the early 2000s, [[economies of scale]] drove down the cost of colorburst crystals, so they were often used in various other applications, such as [[oscillator]]s for [[microprocessor]]s or for [[amateur radio]]. (3.5795&amp;nbsp;MHz has since become a common [[QRP operation|QRP]] calling frequency in the [[80-meter band]], and its [[frequency multiplier|doubled]] frequency of 7.159&amp;nbsp;MHz is a common calling frequency in the [[40-meter band]]).

'''Domenico Bellizzi''' (1918&amp;ndash;1989), also known under the pseudonym of '''Vorea Ujko''', is among the most popular and respected of the [[Arbëresh]] poets. Domenico Bellizzi was a modest priest from [[Frascineto]] in [[Calabria]] who taught modern literature in [[Firmo]]. Bellizzi died in a car accident in January 1989.

Bellizzi's verse, a refined lyric expression of Arbëresh being, has appeared in many periodicals and anthologies as well as in seven collections, four of which were published in [[Italy]], two in [[Albania]] and one in [[Kosovo]]. Bellizzi is a poet of rich tradition. He is the worthy heir of the great nineteenth-century Arbëresh poets [[Girolamo De Rada]] (1814-1903) and [[Giuseppe Serembe]] (1844-1901), both of whom he admired very much. His verse is intimately linked with the Arbëresh experience, imbued with the ''gjaku i shprishur'' (the scattered blood). Though devoid of the lingering sentiments of romantic nationalism so common in Albanian verse, and the standard motifs of exile lyrics, Bellizzi's poetry does not fail to evince the strength of his attachment to the culture of his Balkan ancestors despite five hundred years in the ''dheu i huaj'' (foreign land).

His verse collections include:
* ''Zgjimet e gjakut'', Castrovillari s.a. (The awakening of the blood);
* ''Kosovë'', Cosenza 1973 (Kossovo);
* ''Mote moderne'', Schiavonea 1976 (Modern times);
* ''Ankth'', Priština 1979 (Anguish);
* ''Stinët e mia'', Corigliano Calabro Stazione 1980 (My seasons);
* ''Këngë arbëreshe'', Tirana 1982 (Arbëresh songs);
* ''Burimi'', Tirana 1985 (The source);
* ''Hapma derën, zonja mëmë'', Tirana 1990 (Open the door, mother).

{{Dutch dialects}}
'''Dutch dialects''' are primarily the dialects that are both [[cognate]] with the [[Dutch language]] and are spoken in the same language area as the [[Dutch standard language]]. Dutch dialects are remarkably diverse and are found in the [[Netherlands]] and [[Flanders|northern Belgium]].

The province of [[Friesland]] is bilingual. The [[West Frisian language]], distinct from Dutch, is spoken here along with standard Dutch and the Stadsfries dialect. A West Frisian standard language has also been developed.

==First dichotomy==
In the east, there is a [[Dutch Low Saxon]] dialect area: in [[Groningen (province)|Groningen]] ([[Gronings]]), [[Drenthe]], [[Overijssel]], and major parts of [[Gelderland]], Low Saxon is spoken. The [[IJssel]] river roughly forms the linguistic watershed here. The group is not [[Low Franconian]] and is very close to neighbouring [[Low German]].
&lt;gallery&gt;
Image:Nederfrankisch.png|Traditionally recognised [[Low Franconian]] dialects
Image:Koart Leegsaksisch.png|Low Saxon in the Netherlands
&lt;/gallery&gt;

==Extension across the borders==
* [[Gronings]], spoken in [[Groningen (province)|Groningen]] (Netherlands), as well as the closely related [[variety (linguistics)|varieties]] in adjacent [[East Frisia]] (Germany), has been influenced by the [[West Frisian language]] and takes a special position within the [[West Low German|Low Saxon Language]].
* [[South Guelderish]] (Zuid-Gelders) is a dialect spoken in [[Gelderland]] (Netherlands) and in adjacent parts of [[North Rhine-Westphalia]] (Germany).
* [[Brabantian]] (Brabants) is a dialect spoken in [[Antwerp (province)|Antwerp]], [[Flemish Brabant]] (Belgium) and [[North Brabant]] (Netherlands).
* [[Limburgish language|Limburgish]] (Limburgs) is spoken in [[Limburg (Belgium)]] as well as in [[Limburg (Netherlands)]] and extends across the German border.
* [[West Flemish]] (Westvlaams) is spoken in [[West Flanders]] (Belgium), the western part of [[Zeelandic Flanders]] (Netherlands) and historically also in [[French Flanders]] (France).
* [[East Flemish]] (Oostvlaams) is spoken in [[East Flanders]] (Belgium) and the eastern part of [[Zeelandic Flanders]] (Netherlands).

==Holland and the Randstad==
In [[Holland]], [[Hollandic]] is spoken, though the original forms of this dialect (which were heavily influenced by a West Frisian [[substratum]] and, from the 16th century on, by [[Brabantian]] dialects) are now relatively rare. The urban dialects of the [[Randstad]], which are Hollandic dialects, do not diverge from standard Dutch very much, but there is a clear difference between the city dialects of [[Rotterdam]], [[The Hague]], [[Amsterdam]] or [[Utrecht (city)|Utrecht]]. 
[[Image:Niederländische Dialekte.png|300px|thumb|right|Dutch dialects and their peripheries to the West ([[French Flemish]]) and to the East ([[Low Rhenish]])]]
In some rural Hollandic areas more authentic Hollandic dialects are still being used, especially north of Amsterdam.
Another group of dialects based on Hollandic is that spoken in the cities and larger towns of [[Friesland]], where it partially displaced [[West Frisian language|West Frisian]] in the 16th century and is known as [[Stadsfries]] ("Urban Frisian").

==Minority languages==
Germanic languages which have the status of official [[regional language|regional]] or [[minority language]] and are protected by the [[European Charter for Regional or Minority Languages]] in the [[Netherlands]] are [[Limburgish]], [[Dutch Low Saxon]] and [[West Frisian language|West Frisian]].&lt;ref&gt;Council of Europe: [https://www.coe.int/en/web/conventions/full-list/-/conventions/treaty/148 ''Details of Treaty No.148: European Charter for Regional or Minority Languages''], see ''Reservations and declarations''&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Limburgish]] receives protection by chapter 2 of the charter. In [[Belgium]], where Limburgish is spoken as well, it does not receive such recognition or protection, because Belgium did not sign the charter. [[Limburgish]] has been influenced by the [[Ripuarian language|Ripuarian]] dialects like the [[Cologne]] dialect [[Colognian language|Kölsch]], and has had a somewhat different development since the late Middle Ages.

[[Dutch Low Saxon]] also receives protection by chapter 2 of the charter. In some [[states of Germany]], depending on the state, [[Low German]] receives protection by chapter 2 or 3.

[[West Frisian language|West Frisian]] receives protection by chapter 3 of the charter. (West) Frisian evolved from the same [[West Germanic languages|West Germanic]] branch as [[Old English|Anglo-Saxon]] and [[Old Saxon]] and is less akin to Dutch.

==Recent use==
Dutch dialects and regional languages are not spoken as often as they used to be. Recent research by Geert Driessen shows that the use of dialects and regional languages among both Dutch adults and youth is in heavy decline. In 1995, 27 percent of the Dutch adult population spoke a dialect or regional language on a regular basis, while in 2011 this was no more than 11 percent. In 1995, 12 percent of the primary school aged children spoke a dialect or regional language, while in 2011 this had declined to 4 percent. Of the three officially recognized regional languages Limburgish is spoken most (in 2011 among adults 54%, among children 31%) and Dutch Low Saxon least (adults 15%, children 1%); West Frisian occupies a middle position (adults 44%, children 22%).&lt;ref&gt;{{nl}} {{cite book|last1=Driessen|first1=Geert|title=Ontwikkelingen in het gebruik van Fries, streektalen en dialecten in de periode 1995-2011|date=2012|publisher=ITS, Radboud University Nijmegen|pages=3|url=http://www.geertdriessen.nl/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/rap2012-ontwikkeling-dialecten-driessen.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Belgium, however, dialects are very much alive; many senior citizens there are unable to speak standard Dutch.{{Citation needed|date=October 2017}}

==Flanders==
In [[Flanders]], there are four main dialect groups: 
* [[West Flemish]] (West-Vlaams) including [[French Flemish]] in the far North of France, 
* [[East Flemish]] (Oost-Vlaams), 
* [[Brabantian]] (Brabants), which includes several main dialect branches, including Antwerpian, and 
* [[Limburgish]] (Limburgs). 
Some of these dialects, especially West and East Flemish, have incorporated some French [[loanword]]s in everyday language. An example is ''fourchette'' in various forms (originally a French word meaning fork), instead of ''vork''. Brussels is especially heavily influenced by French because roughly 85% of the inhabitants of [[Brussels]] speak French. 
The Limburgish in Belgium is closely related to Dutch Limburgish. An oddity of West Flemings (and to a lesser extent, East Flemings) is that, when they speak AN, their pronunciation of the "soft g" sound (the [[voiced velar fricative]]) is almost identical to that of the "h" sound (the [[voiced glottal fricative]]), thus, the words ''held'' (hero) and ''geld'' (money) sound nearly the same, except that the latter word has a 'y' /j/ sound embedded into the "soft g". When they speak their local dialect, however,  their "g" is almost the "h" of the Algemeen Nederlands, and they do not pronounce the "h".  Some Flemish dialects are so distinct that they might be considered as separate language variants, although the strong significance of language in Belgian politics would prevent the government from classifying them as such. [[West Flemish]] in particular has sometimes been considered a distinct variety. Dialect borders of these dialects do not correspond to present political boundaries, but reflect older, medieval divisions.
[[Image:Languages Benelux.PNG|right|300px|thumb|Minority languages, regional languages and dialects in the Benelux]]

The [[Brabantian]] dialect group, for instance, also extends to much of the south of the Netherlands, and so does [[Limburgish]]. West Flemish is also spoken in [[Zeelandic Flanders]] (part of the Dutch province of Zeeland), and by older people in [[French Flanders]] (a small area that borders Belgium).

==Non-European dialects, and daughter languages==
* Until the early 20th century, variants of Dutch were still spoken by some descendants of [[Dutch colonization of the Americas|Dutch colonies in the United States]]. [[New Jersey]], in particular, had an active Dutch community with a highly divergent dialect spoken as recently as the 1950s. See [[Jersey Dutch]] for more on this dialect.
* In [[Pella, Iowa]], a derivation of [[South Guelderish]] is the [[Pella Dutch dialect]].
* [[Afrikaans]] is a [[daughter language]] of Dutch. It evolved mainly from 17th century Dutch dialects, but had influences from various [[Afrikaans#History|other languages]] in [[South Africa]]. However, it is still largely [[mutual intelligibility|mutually intelligible]] with Dutch. 
* [[Plautdietsch]] is a [[Low German]] variety with influences and elements of Dutch.
* Despite its name, [[Pennsylvania Dutch]] is not a Dutch dialect. It is actually German-based.

'''Esterbrook''' ([[trademark]] name: '''Esterbrook, est. 1858'''&lt;ref name=justia/&gt;) is a [[brand]] of [[fountain pen|fountain]] and [[ballpoint pen|ballpoint]] pens, produced by Harpen Brand Holdings, LLC, which acquired the rights to manufacture pens under the "Esterbrook" brand name.&lt;ref name=relaunch&gt;[http://esterbrookpen.com/americas-original-pen-company-returns-december-2014/ "America’s Original Pen Company” returns December 2014"] on Esterbrook website, 15 Nov 2014&lt;/ref&gt;

Originally, Richard Esterbrook was the largest pen manufacturer in the [[United States of America|United States]], having reached a record of producing 216,000,000 pens a year.&lt;ref name=kamakura&gt;[http://www.kamakurapens.com/Archive/EsterbrookPens.html Esterbrook history in Kamakura Pens website]&lt;/ref&gt; The company produced [[dip pen]]s, then concentrating on [[fountain pen]]s until it was acquired by Venus Pencils in 1967, ceasing activities in 1971.

==History==

===The beginning===
[[File:Richard esterbrook portrait.jpg|thumb|left|130px|Richard Esterbrook, founder.]]

[[File:Esterbrook 356-357-358.jpg|thumb|right|170px|Esterbrook's 356, 357 and 358 art &amp; drafting pens.]]

Richard Esterbrook (1812-1895 &lt;ref name=whiteapple&gt;[http://www.whiteapplemultimedia.com/history.html History of Esterbrook pens]&lt;/ref&gt;) was a Cornish Quaker from England who saw an opportunity in the United States to manufacture steel pens. In 1856 he traveled to the US to set up shop as "The Steel Pen Manufacturing Company". In 1858 he was able to establish himself as the sole pen manufacturer in the USA and he changed the company name to "The Esterbrook Steel Pen Mfg. Co.", with just 15 employees and settled down in Camden, New Jersey. At the time, two of the four pen companies located in the United States were situated in Camden. Besides Esterbrook, the first in the country, the C. Howard Hunt Pen Company at 7th and State streets produced pens, pencil sharpeners and allied products and employed 125 workers. At its height, the Esterbrook plant had 450 workers and produced 600,000 pens a day.&lt;ref name=hanspresto&gt;[http://hans.presto.tripod.com/nibs/esterbrook.html Esterbrook pens in Blam! calligraphy page]&lt;/ref&gt;

There were no men in this country learned in the pen trade and no suitable machinery, so it was necessary to design and build all machines. Only fifteen people made up the first payroll, but the growth of the company was steady. The buildings were added to from time to time and in 1912 a five-story concrete building was erected nearly doubling the size of the plant. Automatic Machines replaced hand work, and the output greatly increased.

===Development===
Quality was a key factor in his success. His steel pens were versatile, long lasting, and came in many different styles to fit the varied writing styles of the public. Sadly, Richard Esterbrook didn't see the "empire" his company was to become as he died in Atlanta on October 12, 1895. 
 
Just one year after his death, in 1896 the company started an Esterbrook branch in England to join the ranks of the other main pen manufactures in Birmingham. By 1920 the fountain pen was fast becoming more popular amongst people who were tired of dipping pens into ink. To meet the demand the company manufactured its first fountain pen. By 1930 the company sought less expensive means of manufacturing pens as gold and jewel tips were growing too expensive and in this same year they began selling fountain pens in England. The Esterbrook Company began using the metal Iridium which they called "Durachrome". To meet the fountain pen demand the company reformed as "The Esterbrook Hazel Pens Ltd". In 1940 war had come to strike a blow at the Esterbrook company.

===Decline===
In 1947 Esterbrook bought out John Mitchell (which had been established in 1822 as the World's first manufacturer to cut nibs by machine) and then acquired Hazell Pen Co. The company re-formed again as "The Esterbrook Pen Company". Some time after that, Esterbrook ceased production of dip pen nibs permanently.

The post war years had seen a decline particularly in the export trade to the traditional markets of the British Empire. As those countries gained independence due to American aid, they had more dollars to spend in the United States than pounds in the United Kingdom.&lt;ref name=hanspresto/&gt;

Esterbrook continued to thrive until the beginning of 1960 when it started to see a decline in export trades with England. In 1967 the Esterbrook Empire was bought out by the Venus Pencil Company and thus the name changed to "Venus Esterbrook", which continued to produce replacement nibs for [[fountain pen]]s. There were numerous administrative changes and moves and eventually their final base of operations was vacated in 1972, though the building still stands today.

Venus Esterbrook would be finally taken over by [[Berol]] in 1971,&lt;ref name=whiteapple/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.berol.co.uk/berolhistory.html History of Berol Company]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.kamakurapens.com/Archive/EsterbrookPens.html Esterbrook history, Kamakura Pens website]&lt;/ref&gt; all Esterbrook operations ceased.&lt;ref name=making&gt;[http://esterbrookpen.com/history-in-the-making/ History in the making] on Esterbrook website, 10 Jul 2015&lt;/ref&gt;

===Revival===
In 2014, Harpen Brand Holdings, LLC announced the revival of the Esterbrook Pen brand after securing the trademark rights for the Esterbrook brand name.&lt;ref name=relaunch/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.usatoday.com/story/money/business/2015/02/05/reviving-the-pen-that-wrote-american-history/22941265/ "Classic pen brand brought back from the dead" by Devin Loring], USA Today, 9 Feb 2015&lt;/ref&gt; The brand, now named "Esterbrook, est. 1858",&lt;ref name=justia/&gt; launched new versions of classic Esterbrook models, such as the "Deluxe" fountain pen and the "J" ballpoint pen, both originally released in the 1950s.&lt;ref&gt;[http://esterbrookpen.com/products/ Products] on Esterbrook website&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Carl_barks.jpg|thumb|right|150px|[[Carl Barks]] was an Esterbrook enthusiast.]]

The famous [[Walt Disney Company|Disney]] artist [[Carl Barks]] was an enthusiastic user of Esterbrook pens. He particularly used a Nº 356 model to ink and letter his famous [[Donald Duck]] comic-book pages.&lt;ref name=hanspresto/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.badboycomics.com/ddweekly-2010-45/carl-barks-esterbrook-356.html Carl Barks talks about Esterbook pens]&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quotation|"...I drew direct onto the drawing paper with a [[Scripto]] light blue pencil, and inked with a 356 Esterbrook pen. My wife inked the dialogue with an A-5 or B-6 Speedball, and blacked the solid areas with a #2 sable brush."|Carl Barks (Letter to [[Michael Barrier (historian)|Michael Barrier]], January 14, 1967)&lt;ref name=Barks&gt;[http://hans.presto.tripod.com/isbn/1578065011.html Carl Barks letters]&lt;/ref&gt;}}

{{quotation|"...I used a #356 Esterbrook art and drafting pen which could do everything from thin 'fadeaways' to broad accented curve sweeps on foreground circles such as the ducks' forms. The trick of breaking in a new pen, I discovered, is to soak it for several minutes in the ink bottle. Then wipe off the ink and the pen's varnish. For some weird reason most new pens then start out flexible and free-flowing..."|Carl Barks (Letter to Scott Matheson, March 21, 1973)&lt;ref name=Barks/&gt;}}

[[Peanuts]] creator [[Charles M. Schulz]] used an Esterbrook 914 Radio nib for inking the [[comic strip]]. He liked the nib so much, he bought the remaining stock when Esterbrook went out of business.&lt;ref name=making/&gt;&lt;ref name=schulz&gt;[https://schulzmuseum.org/collections/pen/ Charles M.

It takes up to 250 sheets for a "make ready," which is the process of getting the plates inked up and the ink levels set correctly.

[[Printer (publishing)|Printers]] use the term "gang run" or "gang" to describe the practice of placing many print projects on the same sheet or piggybacking a project on a vacant, unused portion of a print sheet.  Sheet-fed presses are generally "full sheet" (28" x 40"), "half sheet" (28" x 19"), or "quarter sheet" (13" x 19").  In offset printing, the first sheet costs more than the next 1,000.  Gang-run printing allows multiple jobs to share the setup cost.  For example, a 28" x 40" sheet can hold 9 4" x 6" at 5,000 or 18 2,500 postcards (each card takes 4.25" x 6.25" on the sheet to accommodate [[full bleed]]. Gang-run printing has been one of the driving forces in the large drop in the price for full-color printing.

==Advantages==

* Extremely economical—many print jobs share the same print run, which reduces manpower, plates, prep time, and press washup labor.
* Reduces waste—less paper goes unused.

==Disadvantages==

* Lack of paper stock choice—you must choose the paper stock common to all the projects on the same sheet
* Lack of [[color]] control—color balance on a gang print run is difficult to maintain. Since so many other print projects are placed side by side, a gang print project is harder to control for color quality issues
* Ghosting—because an adjacent project may have a heavy solid color that may affect your final result
* Hard to accommodate custom print quantities—normally
* Reprints cost more—rerunning a print job from the sample plate would mean reproducing unwanted copies of adjacent projects sharing the same sheet or plate
* Harder to get custom colors or cut—by nature of the press run, it is harder to get custom spot colors, varnish effects, or coatings.
* Timing issues—gang printing customers normally need to be more patient with their client, since it takes more time and effort to coordinate all the jobs through the singer viewer.&lt;ref name=Whitsett/&gt;

== Restrictions ==
The [[Food and Drug Administration (United States)|U.S. Food and Drug Administration]] (FDA) warns to be aware of the potential of ''foreign'' packages, which may come from gang printing at the package supplier. Pharmaceutical labels and packaging materials are higher in cost primarily as a result of the additional costs in manufacturing due to segregation, traceability, and security requirements. You cannot ''gang run'' pharmaceutical labels that require strict line clearance between label kinds, unless the labeling from gang-printed sheets is adequately differentiated by size, shape, or color (21 CFR Part 211.122f).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.accessdata.fda.gov/scripts/cdrh/cfdocs/cfcfr/CFRSearch.cfm?fr=211.122 21 CFR Part 211.122 f)]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Gopala Chandra Praharaj''' (9 September 1874 – 16 May 1945) was a writer and [[linguist]] in the [[Odia language]], well known as the compiler of the ''[[Purnachandra Odia Bhashakosha]]''. He also contributed significantly to [[Odia literature]] by his works in prose. A lawyer by profession, Praharaj wrote several [[Satire|satirical]] and analytical essays, in magazines such as ''Utkal Sahitya'', ''Rasachakra'', ''Nababharata'', and ''Satya Samachar'', on the social, political and cultural issues of contemporary Odisha (Odisha) during early 20th century.

==Early life==
Praharaj was born on 9 September 1874 to an aristocratic Zamindar Brahmin family of Siddheswarpur in [[Cuttack district]]. He completed his matriculation from Ravenshaw Collegeate School&lt;ref name="Hindu092006" /&gt; and studied FA from [[Ravenshaw college]] of Cuttack. He studied law at [[Calcutta University]] and became a lawyer in 1902.

==Life as a writer==
He started writing essays in the Magazine Utkal Sahitya in 1901 by the caption "Bhagabata Tungire Sandhya", which is the first published work by the author. It was followed by Bai Mohanty Panji and many other writings on socio-cultural and political issues. He followed the footsteps of [[Fakir Mohan Senapati]] and made a remarkable development in Odia satirical literature. Praharaj used the colloquial speech of Odisha along with Hindustani, Parsi, English, Sanskrit and folk language in his prose works.&lt;ref name="Hindu092006" /&gt; He wrote several critical essays with different pen names in many magazines up to his old age. However, he dedicated around three decades of his life to the compilation of ''Purnachandra Odia Bhashakosha''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Current Trends in Linguistics |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=JqYMTdBws40C&amp;pg=PA138&amp;lpg=PA138&amp;dq=%22Gopala+Chandra+Praharaj%22+-wikipedia#v=onepage&amp;q=%22Gopala%20Chandra%20Praharaj%22%20-wikipedia&amp;f=false |page=138 |year=1972 |accessdate=14 July 2012 |author1=Sebeok |first1=Thomas Albert}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Indian Literature edited by Dr. Nagendra, Prabhat Prakashan&lt;/ref&gt;

===Purnachandra Odia Bhashakosha===
Purnachandra Odia Bhashakosha is the most comprehensive lexicon in [[Odia language]]. It presents the meaning of words in four languages—Odia, English, Hindi and Bengali,&lt;ref name="srujanikaDict"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.srujanika.org/dictionary.php?dictid=1 |title=Purnachandra Oriya Bhashakosha |publisher=Srujanika.org |accessdate=19 July 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120128120240/http://www.srujanika.org/dictionary.php?dictid=1 |archivedate=28 January 2012 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; and explains the origin, development and use of the words.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Major Historical Events from Kalingan War Till Orissa Became a Separate Province |url=http://orissa.gov.in/e-magazine/Orissareview/2010/April/engpdf/10-13.pdf |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130928074250/http://orissa.gov.in/e-magazine/Orissareview/2010/April/engpdf/10-13.pdf |dead-url=yes |archive-date=28 September 2013 |publisher=orissa.gov.in |format=PDF |page=11 |accessdate=14 July 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It consists of around 9,500 pages and 185 thousand words in 7 volumes.&lt;ref name="srujanikaDict" /&gt; Praharaj not only did the work of compiling the lexicon, but also raised funds for its publication and supervised its printing and sale. Praharaj included in this lexicon not only the words which were used in literature, but also the words of common speech.

[[File:Guru Granth Sahib.jpg|right|300px|thumb|With his words" ''Guru Maneyo Granth'', [[Guru Gobind Singh]] installed the [[Adi Granth]] as the [[Guru Granth Sahib]] as the eternal Sikh Guru]]

"'''''Guru Maneyo Granth'''''" (English: Granth Be Thy Guru) refers to the historic statement of the 10th [[Sikh Guru]], [[Guru Gobind Singh]] (1666–1708), shortly before his demise, on affirming the sacred scripture [[Adi Granth]] as his successor, thus terminating the line of human Gurus. Installed as the [[Guru Granth Sahib]], it is now the central holy scripture of [[Sikhism]], and the eternal living [[Guru]] of all [[Sikhs]]. It is central to Sikh worship as it is said to imbibe the one light of the creator manifested in  the Ten Sikh Gurus - one spirit in ten forms. (Bhai Gurdas) &lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=The making of the eternal Guru  |url=http://www.hindu.com/mag/2008/10/26/stories/2008102650010100.htm |publisher=[[The Hindu]] |date=Oct 26, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The event in 1708 at [[Nanded]] (in present-day [[Maharashtra]]), when Guru Gobind Singh installed Adi Granth as the Guru of Sikhism, was recorded in a ''Bhatt Vahi'' (a bard's scroll) by an eyewitness, Narbud Singh,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

==Adi Granth to Guru Granth Sahib==
[[File:Sri Guru Granth Sahib Nishan.jpg|left|180px|thumb|Illuminated [[Adi Granth]] folio with the seal of [[Guru Gobind Singh]]. The manuscript is of the Lahore recension, late 17th to early 18th century.]]
{{Quote box| width=20%|align=right|quote=[[Punjabi language|Punjabi]]: "ਸੱਬ ਸਿੱਖਣ ਕੋ ਹੁਕਮ ਹੈ ਗੁਰੂ ਮਾਨਯੋ ਗ੍ਰੰਥ"&lt;br /&gt;[[Transliteration]]: "Sab sikhan kō hukam hai gurū mānyō granth"&lt;br /&gt;[[English language|English]]: "All Sikhs are commanded to take the Granth as Guru."|source=- [[Guru Gobind Singh]], October, 1708, [[Nanded]]|}}

The composition of the sacred Granth contains renderings of the Hymns (Bani) of seventh Gurus of the Sikh faith (in addition one sloak of Guru Gobind Singh) and some Bhagats and Saints.  It was composed in this form in the year 1604 with the later addition of Guru Tegh Bahadur's Bani (sacred compositions).  Its blessings are sought by the true seeker with a devout heart.  The Sikh religion sincerely believes that in each of the succeeding Gurus the spirit, the light of God which manifested in Guru Nanak Dev was operating and passed onto the next Sikh Guru. Guru Ram Das says in the Siri Guru Granth Sahib: Waho Waho Satgur Nirankar Hai, Jis Ant Na Paravar - The Lord descends in this world in the form of The Satguru, but only some rare soul/devotee is able to recognise him. (SGGS, Ang 1421)

The sacred Granth is installed in all Sikh holy places of worship and treated as the presiding presence of the Guru, an embodiment of Divine Truth.  The devotees of the Sangat or congregation gather in solemn assembly to pray and seek the blessings of the Supreme.  This comes through in the mystical wisdom contained within the words of Gurbani and it stands for realization of the Truth.  The Gurus' word, known as 'shabad' is taken as the mystic experience of the Guru.

In the words of Bhai Gurdas, a great scholar of the Guru's time, "In the word is the Guru, and the Guru is in the word (shabad).  In other words, the human body was not the Guru, but the light of the word (shabad) within the heart was their real personality." When the human mind dives deeper and deeper into the Guru's word, all mental impurities depart and the wisdom of the Guru permeates the human soul.  Thereby the devotee attains the divine light and wisdom which leads him to contemplate and meditate on God's name (Naam).  In the light of the above realities, the Sikh religion makes the holy Granth the living master of the Sikh Panth.

Before Guru Gobind Singh, the tenth Guru left his human body, he conferred the Guruship to the [Adi Granth]. He then delivered a self-composed hymn:

&lt;blockquote&gt;

* Agya bhai Akal ki tabhi chalayo Panth. Sabh Sikhan ko hukam hai '''Guru manyo Granth'''. Guru Granth Ji manyo pargat Guran ki deh.
 Jo Prabhu ko milo chahe khoj shabad mein le. Raj karega Khalsa aqi rahei na koe ,Khwar hoe sabh milange bache sharan jo hoe."'''''

*Translation:

"Under orders of the Immortal Being, the Panth was created. All  Sikhs are enjoined to accept the Granth as their Guru.
 Consider the Guru Granth as an embodiment of the Gurus.Those who want to meet God, can find Him in its hymns. The pure Khalsa shall rule, and the impures will be left no more, Those separated will unite and all the devotees of the Guru shall be saved."&lt;/blockquote&gt;

He also offered his obeisance to the sacred Granth thus conveying his Light to it.  This historic development took place in Oct. 1708 which ensured that the order of the Khalsa brotherhood always remained an abiding force for Sikh Panth unity.

== Mul Mantar ==
&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:Sggs.jpg|thumb|180px|A [[Granthi]] reads from the Sri [[Guru Granth Sahib]]{{FFDC|1=Sggs.jpg|log=2011 November 20|date=November 2011}}]] --&gt;

{{main|Mul Mantar}}
The [[Guru Granth Sahib]] begins with the ''[[Mul Mantar]]'', an iconic verse created by Nanak:
:{{lang-pa|ੴਸਤਿਨਾਮੁਕਰਤਾਪੁਰਖੁਨਿਰਭਉਨਿਰਵੈਰੁਅਕਾਲਮੂਰਤਿਅਜੂਨੀਸੈਭੰਗੁਰਪ੍ਰਸਾਦਿ॥}}
:[[ISO 15919]] [[transliteration]]: ''Ika ōaṅkāra sati nāmu karatā purakhu nirabha'u niravairu akāla mūrati ajūnī saibhaṅ gura prasādi jap ade sache jugade sache, haibhi sach, Nanake hosee bhee sache'
:Simplified transliteration: Ik ōaṅkār sat nām kartā purkh nirbha'u nirvair akāl mūrat ajūnī saibhaṅ gur prasād jap, aad sach, jugad sach, hai bhee sach, Nanak hosi bhee sach.

Historical events have clearly brought out that when Guru Nanak Dev appeared before the Supreme Lord, he himself presented to him a cup of God's name, known as Amrita to propagate in his subjects. Guru Nanak Dev received the Mul Mantar in his divine consciousness which defines the fundamental directive spiritual philosophy of Sikhism.  It appears in the very beginning of Sri Granth Sahib, ahead of [[Japji]].

It is composed of two elements – the figure ek (1) and logo or symbol 'onkar'. The term 'ekonkar' in full form was meant to describe transcendent formless god as creator, sustainer and dissoluter. The symbol 'onkar' gives mystical interpretation of immanent spirit of god and his becoming aspect which created the universe. It is a well-known fact that this universe was created through a primordial sound (kavao), known as first wisdom of god. It acts as an intermediary between the creator and his creation.  God is spirit and pure light (Jyoti) which excites every human mind to realize the truth.

In Sikh mysticism, while meditating on Mul Mantar and its repetition believed to lead the soul to absorption in the absolute. The Mul Mantar and the Gurmantra Waheguru - the Name of god in Sikhism, repeated constantly induce a high spiritual state. The Gurmantra Waheguru - Naam unites the individual soul with the God. The Mul Mantar invokes all qualities of God. It is called the fate remover. Thus God's name is not a syllable word but a code to unfold the mystic properties of divine spirit which controls the cosmic and human being through invisible law of nature. Real name of god implies expression of his pervasive personality and concrete truth of His existence. Naam demands moulding of our personality which is meant opening of our inner self to establish personal touch with reality.  Therefore, one has to be ethically strong, thoughtful and rightly meditative to attain this higher truth which is immediate and principle of man. Birth as a human being is to be taken as an opportunity to achieve liberation.  It is because the achievement of emancipation is possible to man alone and that too on this earth. The history of a particular individual, the number of times he experiences rebirth depends entirely upon the quality of his will, upon the moral effort he puts forth.

To sum up, Sri Guru Granth Sahib of Sikh faith is a unique spiritual measure which gives an analytical view of the divine claws which are hidden from human gaze. Each chosen word of the text encodes the secret power of the eternity and blueprints of his working in the fleeting world of forms.

'''Harcharan Singh''' (1914–2006) was a Punjabi dramatist and writer. He dedicated 69 years of his life to Punjabi theater, in which he authored 51 books and staged numerous plays all over the world.&lt;ref name="monograph" /&gt;

==Life==
Singh was born in 1914 at Chak # 576, near Nankana Sahib (now in Pakistan) to father, Kirpa Singh, and mother, Rakkhi.&lt;ref name="lifehistory" /&gt; He was sent to his ancestral village, Urapar in Jalandhar District, for education. After passing class 8th from the Govt. School, Chakdanna, Singh was sent to Khalsa School, Jalandhar, for Matric (Class 10). Singh enrolled in B.A. at [[Khalsa College, Amritsar]] in 1933. Then he obtained his master's degree in Punjabi and history from [[Forman Christian College|FC College Lahore]]. Moreover, he earned his Ph.D. degree in orientalism and oriental history, with particular emphasis on classical, pre-[[Maurya Empire|Maurya]] Indo-Aryan dynasties of the Punjab and Himalayas for his thesis "Theatre Traditions in Punjab" from [[Delhi University]] in 1943.&lt;ref name=sikhencyclopedia&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.thesikhencyclopedia.com/famous-sikh-personalities/singh-harcharan-1915 | title=Singh, Harcharan (1915-) | work=The Sikh Encyclopedia | accessdate=6 April 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

He was the head of Punjabi Dept., [[Punjabi University]], Patiala, for 10 years, from 1965 to 1975. He held the post of chairman at the Punjab Sangeet Natak Academy from 1982 to 1991 and again from 1994 to 1997. He was then appointed the chairman of Punjab Arts Council, Chandigarh, from 1999 to 2002.&lt;ref name="George1992"&gt;{{cite book|author=K. M.

Huvadhu Bas spoken by the inhabitants of the large atoll of [[Huvadhu Atoll|Huvadhu]] is one of the distinctive dialects of [[Maldivian language]] from Southern Maldives. Because of the isolation from the Northern Atolls, and the capital of Malé, Huvadhu Bas compared to other variants has many distinctive features. One of those feature is making use of the retroflex 'Ţ' as in [[Sinhala language|Sinhalese]] instead of retroflex 'ṣ' used in northern variants.

In the past, there were frequent monthly trade relations between the ports of [[Huvadhu Atoll]] and the ports of [[Ceylon]]. As a result, there was great intercourse with the [[Sinhalese people]] from [[Ceylon]] and people from [[Huvadhu Atoll|Huvadhu]] unlike that of other Maldivian atolls. Due to this Huvadhu bas has been influenced by the [[Sinhala language]] greater than other Maldivian dialects. Huvadhu Bas retains many old Sinhala words, and is linguistically closer to [[Sinhala language|Sinhala]] than the other dialects of [[Maldivian language|Maldivian]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2519">'''JABBER: The Jabberwocky Engine''' is a [[Java (programming language)|Java]] program created by Neil Hennessy, a poet and [[new media]] artist.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://epc.buffalo.edu/authors/hennessey/data/essays/Jabber_epoetry.htm|title=Neil Hennessy profile|work=Electronic Poetry Center|publisher=[[University at Buffalo, The State University of New York|SUNY Buffalo]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Its purpose is to create neologisms of the type used by [[Lewis Carroll]] in his poem ''[[Jabberwocky]]''.

The Jabberwocky Engine operates by connecting randomly floating letters in its operational box using lexical rules to create letter combinations that are likely to form pronounceable [[English language|English]] words.  Users may then incorporate the created words into their own Jabberwocky-like poems.

Jabberwocky uses the digital environment to demonstrate the analogy between linguistic chemistry and molecular chemistry. Each of the letters represent atoms, while words act as molecules; they interact within the digital interface.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.poemsthatgo.com/gallery/winter2004/jabber/index.htm|title=Jabber The Jabberwocky Engine |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170401144943/http://poemsthatgo.com/gallery/winter2004/jabber/index.htm |archive-date=April 1, 2017 |dead-url=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The following is a list of the '''largest cities in the [[Punjab region]] by population''' located in modern divisions which were part of the [[Punjab Province (British India)|British Punjab Province]] as at 1947 when the modern countries of India and Pakistan were created. Accordingly, the [[Punjab]] is a geographical region in South Asia now divided politically by [[Pakistan]] and [[India]] and is also administratively divided into provinces, states, and territories within both countries. This list deals with the areas within city administrative boundaries (city propers), urban areas, and metropolitan areas.

The '''Luish''', '''Asakian''', or '''Sak''' languages are a group of [[Sino-Tibetan languages]] belonging to the [[Sal languages|Sal branch]]. They are spoken in Burma and Bangladesh, and consist of the [[Sak language|Sak]], [[Kadu language|Kadu]], and [[Ganan language|Ganan]] languages. In recent years, Luish languages have been influenced by [[Burmese language|Burmese]] and [[Chakma language|Chakma]] Bengali.

Although Luish languages are now widely scattered and spoken by relatively small populations, Luce (1985) suggests that the Luish languages were “once spread over the whole north of Burma, from [[Manipur]] perhaps to northern [[Yunnan]].”

Matisoff (2013)&lt;ref name="Matisoff2013"/&gt; proposes the name ''Asakian'', since ''Lui'' or ''Loi'' were used by the [[Meithei language|Meithei]] to refer to slaves.

==Extinct languages==
Matisoff (2013)&lt;ref name="Matisoff2013"/&gt; has demonstrated that the extinct [[Andro language|Andro]], [[Sengmai language|Sengmai]], and [[Chairel language|Chairel]] languages of [[Manipur]] are also Luish languages.

Andro, Sengmai, and Chairel are extinct and known only from a glossary recorded in 1859, their speakers having switched to [[Meitei language|Meitei]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are also various unattested varieties of ''Lui'' or ''Loi'' mentioned in nineteenth-century accounts that appear to be Luish varieties.

It is uncertain whether the extinct [[Pyu language (Burma)|Pyu language]] of central Myanmar is a Luish language.

Benedict (1972) and Shafer (1974) had classified the extinct [[Taman language (Sino-Tibetan)|Taman language]] of northern Myanmar as part of the Luish branch, but it has since been shown by Keisuke Huziwara (2016) to be a non-Luish language, possibly a separate branch of Tibeto-Burman.

==Reconstruction==
Proto-Luish has been reconstructed by Huziwara (2012)&lt;ref name="Huziwara2012"/&gt;, with additional Proto-Luish lexical reconstructions by Matisoff (2013).&lt;ref name="Matisoff2013"/&gt; Like [[Proto-Austroasiatic language|Proto-Austroasiatic]] and Jingpho, Proto-Luish has a [[sesquisyllable|sesquisyllabic]] syllable structure.

Proto-Luish reconstructions by Huziwara (2012)&lt;ref name="Huziwara2012"/&gt;, listed by original order and number, are provided below.

The '''Mizo people''' ([[Mizo language|Mizo]]: ''Mizo hnam'') are an [[ethnic group]] native to [[North-East India|north-eastern India]], western [[Burma]] (Myanmar) and eastern [[Bangladesh]]; this term covers several ethnic peoples who speak various [[Kuki-Chin languages]], but the languages are fairly relatable to one another. The Mizos are one of the tribal hill peoples of South Asia. All Mizo tribes and clans, in their folk legends, claim that [[Chhinlung/Sinlung/Khul]], which means 'covered rock'or cave in the [[Mizo languages]], was the cradle of the Mizos. Thus, it's sometimes concluded that the Mizo people lived as cave dwellers at some point.

There is no trace of human existence in Mizoram before the advent of the Mizo, largely due to the mountainous terrain and the forest coverage so thick that most sunlight could not reach the ground. Even today, the percentage of forest coverage in Mizoram is the highest in India, at 88.93% in 2015 as reported by the [[Forest Survey of India]]. Since the '''Lusei''' tribe were the first Mizo people to become known to outside groups, the larger ethnic group was initially called "Lushai" after them. In the earlier times, the Mizos are headhunters, taking the heads of an enemy after a battle and keeping the head as trophy. The advent of Christianity, more than a century ago had greatly transformed the people into modern society. The present Indian state of [[Mizoram]] (literally "Mizoland") was called the [[Lushai Hills]] or Lushai Country and was defined as an excluded area&lt;ref&gt;Govt. Of India (Excluded &amp; Partially Excluded Areas) Order, 1936&lt;/ref&gt; during the [[British Raj]] and a district of [[Assam]] in independent India. The people of the Lushai Hills demanded a distinct political territory when India achieved independence. Due to continued efforts by its people to gain autonomy, the national government approved Mizoram in 1972 as a [[Union Territory]] and in 1987 as a full-fledged state of the Republic of India India.

As the people organized, they chose to identify as Mizo, rather than by individual clan/tribe names such as [[Lushei]], [[Ralte]], [[Lai people|Lai]], [[Hmar]], etc. Thus, there is no Mizo Tribe as such, rather an umbrella name for all the different tribes. However, unfortunately, there still are some groups who refuse to be termed Mizo and  caused minor conflicts between the two. These groups are mostly from outside the State Of Mizoram, living in the neighboring territories. Of their languages, the most widely-spoken is the "Duhlian" dialect, which is the common language of all Mizos belong to the [[Tibeto-Burman languages|Tibeto-Burman]] language family. The state has one of the highest literacy rates in India, at more than 90%.

==Etymology==
The term Mizo is derived from two Mizo words: ''mi'' and ''zo''. ''Mi'' in Mizo means 'person'. The term ''zo'' is disputed. According to one view, ''zo'' means 'highland' and Mizo means highlander or person living in high hills.

Though the term Mizo is often used to name an overall ethnicity, it is an umbrella term to denote the various clans, such as the [[Hmar]], [[Ralte]], [[Lai people|Lai]], [[Lusei]] etc. A number of dialects are still spoken under the umbrella of Mizo;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=KHAWTINKHUMA,|first=VANTHUAMA|title=MEMORANDUM SUBMITTED TO HIS MAJESTY'S GOVERNMENT BY MIZO UNION|url=http://zolengthe.net/documents/mizo-union-1947/|publisher=ZOLENTHE.NET|accessdate=17 August 2012|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120207055552/http://zolengthe.net/documents/mizo-union-1947/|archivedate=7 February 2012|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; some of them are [[Mizo language|Mizo ṭawng]] (which is an official language of [[Mizoram]]), the [[Hmar languages]], the [[Ralte language]], the [[Paite languages]], the [[Lai languages]], and the [[Pang languages]].

==Demography==
Sandwiched between Burma to the east and south and Bangladesh to the west, the Indian State of [[Mizoram]] and its surrounding areas are inhabited by the Mizo people. According to Rev Liangkhaia, the clergyman and Mizo historian, in his book "Mizo Chanchin" - the first ever published historical account of the Mizo - the Mizo people migrated from China in around 750 AD and stayed in western Myanmar. They then slowly began migrating towards the present day Mizoram during the fourth decade of the 16th Century. Most of the Mizos and their clans had completely migrated to their present location by the third decade of the 18th century.

Mizo people were influenced by British missionaries in the 19th century, as the [[British Raj]] subjugated the chieftainship under its dominance, which they later abolished by an [https://landrevenue.mizoram.gov.in/page/profile Act] called the Assam-Lushai District (Acquisition of Chief's Rights) Act in  1954. The spread of education by [[Christian missionaries]] led to a high literacy rate of 91.58% by 2011. Almost all the Mizos also adopted Christianity, and continues to be so till the present day. &lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;Census of India 2011, Provisional Population.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Mizos speak various [[Mizo languages]], such as Duhlian ([[Lushai language|Lushei]]), [[Gangte language|Gangte]] and [[Hmar language|Hmar]], as well as other Kuki-Chin languages such as [[Pawi language|Pawi]], [[Ralte language|Ralte]], [[Pang language|Pang]], [[Paite language|Paite]], and [[Thado language|Thado]].

===Religion===
{{see also|Bnei Menashe}}
Khuma Hmar and Khara were the first to be converted into Christian among the Mizos.
A great majority of ethnic Mizo people are Christians. The major [[Christian denominations]] are [[Mizoram Presbyterian Church|Presbyterian]] (majority, influenced by the affiliations of the early missionaries), [[Baptist Church of Mizoram|Baptist]], Wesleyan Methodist Church, [[United Pentecostal Church International]], Independent Church of India, Evangelical Free Church Of India in the Northern part of Mizoram in Sinlung hills Council(northern Aizawl and northeastern Kolasib district,   [[The Salvation Army]], [[Lairam Jesus Christ Baptist Church (LIKBK)|Lairam Jesus Christ Baptist Church]], [[Seventh-day Adventist Church|Seventh-day Adventist]], [[Roman Catholic]], [[Pentecostal]] churches and [[Evangelical Baptist Convention|EBC(Evangelical Baptist Convention Church)]] in Champhai and Aizawl.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Kima|title=Chp 149. Mizoram: The Denominations.|url=http://mizohican.blogspot.in/2007/10/chp-149-mizoram-denominations.html|publisher=Blogger|accessdate=17 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
The Chin Baptist Church is in Champhai area in the eastern part of the state.

In the late 20th century, a rather small number of Mizo and related ethnic peoples in Manipur and Mizoram began practicing Judaism, stating that they are descendants of Manasseh, a [[lost tribe of Israel]].{{citation needed|date=August 2015}} They number, at most, several thousands in a population of more than 3.7&amp;nbsp;million in these states. Most Mizos do not agree with this identification. Several hundreds have already emigrated to Israel, where they undergo complete conversion to be accepted as Jews. In 2005, the Chief Rabbi of Israel ruled that they were part of a lost tribe of Israel, but anyone wishing to emigrate to Israel must first complete formal conversion to Judaism in Nepal.{{citation needed|date=August 2015}}

Pre-colonialist Mizos were animists, but once the British colonized the area, the British officials converted most of the population to Christianity from their practice of Animism, ie. worshipping Nature (e.g., the Sun, the Moon, Rivers, Mountains and Spirits). As of today, more than 98% of Mizos claim themselves as Christians. Presently, there are arguably no ethnic Mizos who still practice Animism.

==Historical perspective==
During the later part of British rule, the people in Lushai Hills as well as in [[Manipur]] hills held that the [[British raj|British administration]] was trying to exert control through the chiefs of the communities.  There were several rebellions against the British rule as a result, and an anti-chief movement gained ground. In 1946, the Mizo Common Peoples' Union (MCPU) was formed. In the event of India being independent, the [[Mizo Union]], as it was soon called, demanded that Mizoram should be with [[Assam]] rather than adjoined to Burma, as the pro-chief party advocated.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=C Nunthara|title=Mizoram: Society and Polity|year=1996|publisher=Indus Publishing House}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{page needed|date=August 2015}}

With the independence of India, a secessionist group in the Union favored joining with Burma, to which they were linked historically, ethnically and linguistically, with common roots to their languages. The separation of India from Burma in the year 1937, the partition of India in 1947, and the government's administrative extension over the Indian part of the area reduced the free mobility of the inhabitants. The rules to allow free passage across the India-Burma and India-East Pakistan (now India-Bangladesh) international borders were not regularly honored. Chafing at the restrictions, many of the Mizo never accepted the new territorial boundaries; they rebelled in the [[March 1966 Mizo National Front uprising]].

==Sociolinguistic variance==
The multi-ethnic and pluralistic state of Mizoram has numerous communities, such as the Mizo (majority) {which includes the Lusei, Ralte, Hmar, Khiangte, Lai(Pawi), Khawlhring (Mivam/Faihriam), Laizo, Pang, Bawm (Sunthla and Panghawi), Tlanglau,  Mara (Tlosai,Zyhno,Hawthai) etc.}, the Bru (Riang/Tuikuk), and the Chakma (Takam).

=== Mara ===
{{Main|Mara people}}
[[Mara people|Mara]], earlier known as Lakher, Zochhia, Shendu, Magha, is the predominant community of the southeastern district of [[Siaha]]. The demand for a separate Lakher hills district in 1945 led to the formation of an organized political party called Mara Freedom Party. Under the Sixth Schedule Amendment of Indian Constitution, they were granted an autonomous district council, [[Mara Autonomous District Council]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Prithwipati Chakraborty|first=Ram Prasad|title=Administration of Justice in Mizoram|year=2006|publisher=Mittal Publication}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
They have continued to struggle politically based on their strong identity. They have maintained their language through education, initially supported by the work of Christian missionaries. Due to the spread of Christianity, education also spread and molded their social life. The Mara have a high literacy rate. Their language is very much different from the other Kuki-Chin-Naga languages. They are divided mostly into Tlosai, Zyhno and Hawthai tribes in India. The Maras do not have any cave dwelling theories of their ancestors instead they told themselves of coming out of Kale-Kabaw valley.

=== Paite ===
{{Main|Paite people}}
The Paites are indigenous tribes of [[Mizoram]] under the Greater Assam state since 1750 AD. The Tribal Research Institute of Mizoram in their published book,"[[Paite people|Paite]] in Mizoram" stated that the Paite people entered the present Mizoram along with Palian Chief of [[Lushai]] around the first half of the 18th century. The Union Government has recognised Paite as one of the tribes in Mizoram vide The Gazette of India Notice No. 10 of 2003 date 8 January 2003 of the Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes Orders (Amendment) Act, 2002.

The Paites are socially and culturally distinct from other tribes of Mizoram. Major Shakespeare, the then first Superintendent of [[Lushai Hills]] said that [[Paite language|Paite]] dialect is unintelligible to Lushai. He also recorded that Paite have distinct culture and custom. They now have a separate semi-autonomous body called the Sialkal Range Development Council in the northern part of Champhai with headquarters at mimbung.

===Lai===
{{Main|Lai people}}
In 1953 India adopted a constitution defining itself as a Sovereign Democratic Republic. At that time the Lai people of the southern part of Mizoram, a segment of the much larger population of Lai/Chin, were granted an [[Autonomous District Council]] under the Sixth Schedule of the constitution, to support their identity. [[Lawngtlai]] was created as the Headquarters of [[Lai Autonomous District Council]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Pachuau|first=Rintluanga|title=Mizoram: A Study in Comprehensive Geography|year=2009|publisher=Northern Book Center}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The people have maintained use of their language in the community and in their education. Maintenance of language as a symbol of identity has been inculcated up to Middle school standard. The Lai Autonomous District Council managed their education from Primary to Middle stage, in which the state government (Mizoram) has no control or interference. Lai people speak both [[Lai languages|Lai]] and [[Mizo language]]s (the latter is official in the state).

=== Pang ===
{{Main|Pang people}}
The [[Pang people|Pang]] are one of the numerous tribes of Mizoram in India. They are found largely in the Chamdur valley of Bungtlang South Rural Development Block and some villages in Chawngte, Tlabung and West Phaileng Subdivisions. They have no separate regional self-government or autonomous body of their own.

Together with the Bawm and Tlanglau, they have been struggling to be recognized as a separate tribe.Most of them dwell in Chamdur Valley of India and Chittagong Hills Tracts of Bangladesh.

=== Hmar ===
{{Main|Hmar people}}
The [[Hmar people|Hmar]] are another of the numerous Mizo tribes of India, the Hmar tribe occupying a large area in the northeast of India, Pherzawl District of Manipur,Various places across  Tripura and Cachar,Hailakandi,Karimganj, NC Hills District of Assam. In Mizoram the Hmar are also found in Aizawl, Kolasib, Champhai and Lunglei districts but majority of the Hmars who live in Mizoram speak the Duhlian language, and few of them who live in Sinlung Hills District Council (SHDC) still speak the Hmar(Darngawn) dialect. In Mizoram, they reside mainly in Aizawl, Kolasib, Mamit, Champhai and Lunglei. Literally, ''Hmar'' means tying of hair in a knot at the backside of the head. At some point the people of the Lusei hills were recorded as Lusei which includes many tribes like the Ralte, Lai and Hmar.{{citation needed|date=November 2015}} Some scholars believe the name Hmar refers to a characteristic style of wearing a knot of hair on top of the head.{{citation needed|date=November 2015}}

In July 1986, after the signing of the [[Mizo Accord]], some Hmar leaders here formed Mizoram Hmar Association, later renamed the Hmar People's Convention (HPC). The HPC spearheaded a political movement for self-governance of the Hmar in Mizoram, demanding an Autonomous District Council (ADC) to cover the Hmar-dominated areas in the north and northwest of Mizoram. They wanted as much autonomy as had been granted to the Mara and Lai (see above).{{citation needed|date=November 2015}}

The HPC activists formed an armed wing, the Hmar Volunteer Cell (HVC). The State Government forced them to take up arms until 1992, when representatives of the HPC and the Government of Mizoram mutually agreed to hold ministerial level talks. After multiple rounds of talks, they signed a Memorandum of Settlement (MoS) in Aizawl on 27 July 1994. Armed cadres of the HPC surrendered along with their weapons in October 1994. The government established the [[Sinlung Hills Development Council]] (SHDC) for the Hmar. Some of the HPC leaders and cadres rejected Memorandum of Settlement, breaking away and forming the Hmar People's Convention – Democratic (HPC-D). It has continued an armed movement for autonomy in the form of Autonomous District Council within Mizoram under the Sixth Schedule to the Constitution of India.{{citation needed|date=November 2015}}
                                                                                                                                         
Sub-tribes or clans:{{citation needed|date=November 2015}}
:The Hmar tribe comprises numerous sub-tribes or clans (Pahnam in Hmar language) such as Biete, Changsan, Chawngthu, Chawrei, Chawthe, Darlong, Darngawn, Faihriem, Hrangkhawl, Huolngo, Khiengte, Khawbung, Lawitlang, Leiri, Lungtau, Neitham, Ngawn, Ngurte, Pang,  Saihmang, Sakechep, Thiek, Vangsie, Zote etc. In the past these tribes had their own villages and their own dialects. However, today majority of the Hmar population use Hmar language.

The Sinlung Hills Development Council  (SHDC) have now been renamed as Sinlung Hills Council as per 2018.

==Political, linguistic and economic situation==
After Indian independence, the democratic change in administrative set-up of [[Mizoram]] led to an anti-chief movement. Feeling was widespread against the autocratic chiefs and for the Mizo Union. In 1955, at a meeting of representatives of various Mizo villages held in [[Aizawl]], the demand arose for a separate hills state. The local people felt they had been ill-served by the Assam Government during the Mautam famine.

When in 1960 the government introduced [[Assamese language|Assamese]] as the official language of the state, there were many protests against the Official Language Act of 1961. This was followed by the [[March 1966 Mizo National Front uprising]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Joshi|first=Hargovindh|title=Mizoram History Past and Present|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=YtX52F_qcWgC&amp;pg=PA11&amp;lpg=PA11&amp;dq=K.+S.+Latourette+Mizoram&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=PysNvhMjFn&amp;sig=BU2TGNA3PpUGXw5AfscZ4DAz-Zg&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=GuotULC1Ms7yrQfs7oGABQ&amp;ved=0CAsQ6AEwAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=K.%20S.%20Latourette%20Mizoram&amp;f=false|publisher=Mittal Publications|accessdate=17 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; resulting in the attack of the military installations in Aizawl, [[Lunglei]] and other towns. The [[Mizo National Front]], formerly known as Mizo National Famine Front, declared independence.

The Indian government designated Mizoram as a Union Territory on 21 January 1972. [[Pu Laldenga]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Chaterjee|first=Suhas|title=Making of Mizoram: Role of Laldenga, Volume 2|publisher=MD Publication}}&lt;/ref&gt; the President of Mizo National Front, signed a [[Peace accord]] in 1986 with the Government of India, stating Mizoram was an integral part of India. Pu Laldenga came to the ministry in the [[Interim government]] which was formed in coalition with Congress in 1987. The Statehood of Mizoram was proclaimed on 20 February 1987.

===Present demand for inclusion in the Eighth Schedule===
With 91.58%&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; per cent literacy, the second highest in Indian states, Mizoram is a leader in the national emphasis on education. Because of this, its people have demanded that [[Mizo language|Mizo ṭawng]] be recognized as an official language in the [[Eighth Schedule to the Constitution]].&lt;ref name="Includes Mizo"&gt;{{cite news|title=Requests to include 38 languages in Constitution pending: Govt|url=http://www.thehindu.com/news/national/article58221.ece|accessdate=17 August 2012|newspaper=The Hindu}}&lt;/ref&gt; The demand is important and expressed in various aspects of social and political life.

The English language is widely used in the state, especially in the fields of education, official matters and other formal domains, as it is in other parts of India. English had already penetrated the life and blood of the Mizo people for a long time along with the spread of education.

[[Christian missionaries]] in the 19th century developed the current alphabetic system adopted for a written form of the Mizo language. Adoption of the Roman script has facilitated people's learning English as a second language. The admiration and demand for the use of English in Mizoram is no different from the same attitude in other parts of India.

The Mizo have conducted a long, drawn-out socio-political struggle for identity and recognition, and succeeded in gaining political power from the central government in New Delhi. They fear being [[Cultural assimilation|assimilated]] with other communities, and continue to insist on their separate identity and use of traditional languages to help maintain that.

The German comic character [[Werner (comics)|Werner]] always greets with ''Moin''.

==Etymology and usage==
{{wiktionary}}
Many people{{who?|date=April 2017}} think that ''moin'' derives from various regional pronunciations of ''(Guten) Morgen'' ("good morning"), which tend to alter, vocalise, or skip ''rg''. However, the word may actually also derive from the [[Dutch language|Dutch]], Frisian, and Low German word ''mo(o)i'', meaning "beautiful" or "good".&lt;ref name=Nordseefische /&gt;&lt;ref name=Nordseekueste /&gt; Similar forms in Low Saxon are ''mooien Dag'', ''mooien Abend'', ''mooien Mor(g)en''. Possibly, as is common in etymology, one origin is correct (either from ''Morgen'' or ''mooi'') but spread thanks to its oral assimilation with the other term.

The [[Luxembourgish]] [[cognate]] of the word is ''moien'', which can mean either "hi" or "morning" (''gudde Moien!'' means "good morning!").

Unlike ''Guten Morgen'', ''moin'' can be used 24 hours a day. It is semantically equivalent to the Low Saxon ([[Plattdüütsch]]) greeting ''Dagg'' and replaced it in many areas. In Southern Jutish, ''mojn'' is used for hello and good bye, but ''mojn mojn'' is solely used for good bye. The double form ''Moin Moin'' is also used as an all day greeting in for example [[Flensburg]] that belonged to Denmark until 1864 and the Swedish region of Scania, part of Denmark until 1658.

==Moi==
In [[Finland]], a similar greeting ''moi'' ({{IPA-fi|ˈmoi|pron}}) is used for "hello", "hi" in the [[Finnish language|Finnish]] language. However, "moi moi" is used as a good bye, similarly to "bye bye" in English, even with a similar intonation. Both are particularly typical of Southwestern Finnish, but through internal migration spread to the capital and with the help of TV to the rest of the language area. ''Moi'''s use is identical to that of ''hei'': diminutive forms ''heippa'' and ''moikka'', and duplication as a good bye. [[Southwest Finland]] traded with Hanseatic cities, so it is plausible that the greeting was borrowed from their dialects.

''Moro'' is found in some parts of Finland and has also been used in the same way as ''moi''. It is theorised that it comes from [[Tampere]] due to its large number of foreign workers and like ''moi'' has been borrowed from [[wikt:Morrow|Morrow]] and abbreviated.

"Moi" is also used in Dutch [[West Low German|Low Saxon]] dialects.

'''Moru''' is a [[Central Sudanic languages|Central Sudanic language]] spoken in [[South Sudan]] by the [[Moru people]]. Dialects are Agi, Andri, ’Bali’ba, Kadiro, also known as Lakama’di, Miza and Moruwa’di.&lt;ref&gt;The Eastern Sudanic Languages. By A. N. Tucker. vol. I. 434 pp. Oxford University Press, 1940&lt;/ref&gt;

The Moru language has been maintained through the use of the language in the church, particularly the [[Episcopal Church of the Sudan]] (ECS).  A number of editions of the Prayer Book (Buku Mätu Ro) and the hymn book (Buku Loŋgo ro) have been published over the years.  

The Moru primer 'Kito Lusi ro Luka be' was first published in 1953 and has been reprinted many times since.&lt;ref&gt;Kito Lusi Ro Luka Be.  1953&lt;/ref&gt;  This is primarily a primer for use in schools.  An adult literacy primer 'Buzevosite' was also produced in the 1970s and published by New Day Publishers in [[Juba]].&lt;ref&gt;Buzevosite.  New Day Publishers, Juba.&lt;/ref&gt;  This primer, in keeping with the strong [[Christian]] commitment of the Moru people, has a Christian theme.

The New Testament and [[Psalms]], 'Taobaro To'di', was first published in 1951.  The full Moru [[bible]], 'Baibolo Alokado', with both the [[Old Testament]] and the [[New Testament]] was published by the [[Bible Society]] in [[Sudan]] in 1999.&lt;ref&gt;Baibolo Alokado.  Bible Society in Sudan.  1999&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Myanmar English''' is the [[register (sociolinguistics)|register]] of the [[English language]] used in [[Myanmar]], spoken as first or second language by an estimated 2.4 million people, about 5% of the population (1997).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Bolton|first=Kingsley|title=English in Asia, Asian Englishes, and the issue of proficiency|journal=English Today|publisher=Cambridge University Press|volume=24|issue=2|pages=3–12|issn=0266-0784|url=http://journals.cambridge.org/action/displayFulltext?type=1&amp;fid=1891540&amp;jid=ENG&amp;volumeId=24&amp;issueId=02&amp;aid=1891536|doi=10.1017/s026607840800014x}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

The [[British Empire]] annexed modern-day Myanmar in three stages over a six-decade span (1824–1885). It administered Myanmar as a province of [[British India]] until 1937, and as a separate colony until 1948. During the [[British rule in Burma|British colonial period]], English was the [[medium of instruction]] in higher education, although it did not replace [[Burmese language|Burmese]] as the vernacular. English was the medium of instruction in universities and two types of secondary schools: English schools and Anglo-Vernacular schools (where English was taught as a second language). Burmese English resembles [[Indian English]] to a degree because of historical ties to India during British colonization.

On 1 June 1950, a new education policy was implemented to replace Burmese as the medium of instruction at all state schools, although universities, which continued to use English as the medium of instruction, were unaffected. English became taught as a second language beginning in the Fifth Standard.&lt;ref name="lwin"&gt;{{Cite report |title=Education in Burma (1945-2000) |url=http://thinkingclassroom.org/Education%20Papers/1.%20Education%20in%20Burma%20(1945-2000),%202000.pdf |author=Thein Lwin| year=2000 |publisher=Migrant Learning Centre }}&lt;/ref&gt; Until 1965, English was the language of instruction at Burmese universities. In 1965, Burmese replaced English as the [[medium of instruction]] at the university level, with the passing of the New University Education Law the previous year.&lt;ref name="myat"&gt;{{cite book |title=Economic development of Myanmar |last=Thein |first=Myat |year=2004 |publisher=Institute of Southeast Asian Studies |location= |isbn=978-981-230-211-3 |pages=115–118}}&lt;/ref&gt; English language education was reintroduced in 1982. Currently, English is taught from Standard 0 (kindergarten), as a second language. Since 1991, in the 9th and 10th Standards, English and Burmese have both been used as the medium of instruction, particularly in science and math subjects, which use English language textbooks.&lt;ref name="lwin"/&gt; Because of this, many Burmese are better able to communicate in written English than in spoken English, due to emphasis placed on writing and reading.

== Characteristics ==
The preferred system of spelling is based on those of the British, although [[American and British English spelling differences|American English]] spellings have become increasingly popular. Because [[Adoniram Judson]], an American, created the first Burmese-English dictionary, many American English spellings are common (e.g. ''color'', ''check'', ''encyclopedia'').&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The Judson Burmese-English dictionary |last=Judson |first=Adoniram |authorlink=Adoniram Judson |author2=Stevenson, Robert Charles |year=1921 |publisher=American Baptist Mission Press |location=Yangon |isbn= |ol=6459075M}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ⟨-ize⟩ spelling is more commonly used than the ⟨-ise⟩ spelling.

Burmese English is often characterised by its unaspirated consonants, similar to Indian English. It also borrows words from standard English and uses them in a slightly different context. For instance, "pavement" (British English) or "sidewalk" (US English) is commonly called "platform" in Burmese English. "Stage show" is also preferred over "concert." In addition, many words retain British pronunciation, such as ''vitamin'' {{IPAc-en|ˈ|v|ɪ|t|əm|ɪ|n}}.  Burmese English is [[non-rhotic]].

For units of measurement Burmese English use both those of the [[Imperial unit|Imperial System]] and those of the [[International System of Units]] interchangeably, but the values correspond to the SI system. Burmese English continues to use Indian numerical units such as [[lakh]] and [[crore]].

===Pronunciation===
In Burmese English, the k, p, and t consonants are unaspirated (pronounced {{IPA|/p/, /t/, /k/}}), as a general rule, as in Indian English. The following are commonly seen pronunciation differences between Standard English and Burmese English:&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite report |title=Refugees From Burma: Their Backgrounds and Refugee Experiences |url=http://www.cal.org/co/pdffiles/refugeesfromburma.pdf |author=Barron, Sandy |author2=John Okell |author3=Saw Myat Yin |author4=Kenneth VanBik |author5=Arthur Swain |author6=Emma Larkin |author7=Anna J.

The workbench, which is accessed as a web application, supports the combination of elementary text-processing components to form comprehensive processing workflows. It provides functionality to manually intervene in the otherwise automatic process of annotation by correcting or creating new annotations, and facilitates user collaboration by providing sharing capabilities for user-owned resources. Argo benefits users such as text-analysis designers by providing an integrated environment for the development of processing workflows; annotators/curators by providing manual annotation functionalities supported by automatic pre-processing and post-processing; and developers by providing a workbench for testing and evaluating text analytics.

=== Big Mechanism ===
Big mechanisms are large, explanatory models of complicated systems in which interactions have important causal effects. Whilst the collection of big data is increasingly automated, the creation of big mechanisms remains a largely human effort, which is becoming made increasingly challenging, according to the fragmentation and distribution of knowledge. The ability to automate the construction of big mechanisms could have a major impact on scientific research. As one of a number of different projects that make up the big mechanism programme, funded by [[DARPA]], the aim is to assemble an overarching big mechanism from the literature and prior experiments and to utilise this for the probabilistic interpretation of new patient panomics data. We will integrate machine reading of the cancer literature with probabilistic reasoning across cancer claims using specially-designed ontologies, computational modeling of cancer mechanisms (pathways), automated hypothesis generation to extend knowledge of the mechanisms and a 'Robot Scientist' that performs experiments to test the hypotheses. A repetitive cycle of text mining, modelling, experimental testing, and worldview updating is intended to lead to increased knowledge about cancer mechanisms.

=== COPIOUS ===
This project aims to produce a knowledge repository of Philippine biodiversity by combining the domain-relevant expertise and resources of Philippine partners with the text mining-based big data analytics of the University of Manchester's National Centre for Text Mining. The repository will be a synergy of different types of information, e.g., taxonomic, occurrence, ecological, biomolecular, biochemical, thus providing users with a comprehensive view on species of interest that will allow them to (1) carry out predictive analysis on species distributions, and (2) investigate potential medicinal applications of natural products derived from Philippine species.

=== Europe PMC Project ===
This is a collaboration with the Text-Mining group at the [[European Bioinformatics Institute]] (EBI) and [[Mimas (data centre)]], forming a work package in the Europe PubMed Central project (formerly UKPMC) hosted and coordinated by the [[British Library]]. Europe PMC, as a whole, forms a European version of the PubMed Central paper repository, in collaboration with the [[National Institutes of Health]] (NIH) in the United States. Europe PMC is funded by a consortium of key funding bodies from the biomedical research funders. The contribution to this major project is in the application of text mining solutions to enhance information retrieval and knowledge discovery. As such this is an application of technology developed in other NaCTeM projects on a large scale and in a prominent resource for the Biomedicine community.

=== Mining Biodiversity ===
This project aims to transform the [[Biodiversity Heritage Library]] (BHL) into a next-generation social digital library resource to facilitate the study and discussion (via social media integration) of legacy science documents on biodiversity by a worldwide community and to raise awareness of the changes in biodiversity over time in the general public. The project integrates novel text mining methods, visualisation, crowdsourcing and social media into the BHL. The resulting digital resource will provide fully interlinked and indexed access to the full content of BHL library documents, via semantically enhanced and interactive browsing and searching capabilities, allowing users to locate precisely the information of interest to them in an easy and efficient manner.

=== Mining for Public Health ===
This project aims to conduct novel research in text mining and machine learning to transform the way in which evidence-based public health (EBPH) reviews are conducted. The aims of the project are to develop new text mining unsupervised methods for deriving term similarities, to support screening while searching in EBPH reviews and to develop new algorithms for ranking and visualising meaningful associations of multiple types in a dynamic and iterative manner. These newly developed methods will be evaluated in EBPH reviews, based on implementation of a pilot, to ascertain the level of transformation in EBPH reviewing.

In [[language acquisition]], '''negative evidence''' is evidence concerning what is not possible in a language. There is debate among linguists whether negative evidence can help child language learners determine the [[grammar]] of their language by disconfirming incorrect hypotheses about how their language works. Importantly, negative evidence does not show what ''is'' grammatical, but helps eliminate ungrammatical constructions by revealing what is ''not'' grammatical. There are two main types of negative evidence in language acquisition: ''direct'' negative evidence and ''indirect'' negative evidence.

== Direct negative evidence ==
'''Direct negative evidence in language acquisition''' consists of utterances that indicate whether a construction in a language is [[Grammaticality|ungrammatical]].&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&amp;nbsp;Direct negative evidence differs from indirect negative evidence because it is ''explicitly'' presented to a language learner (e.g. a child might be corrected by a parent). On the other hand, indirect negative evidence is used to determine ungrammatical constructions in a language by noticing the ''absence'' of such constructions.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Direct negative evidence can be further divided into explicit and implicit forms. Explicit forms of evidence involve a parent telling their child that an utterance was incorrect and then supplying the correct version of that utterance. Implicit forms involve the repetition (or a modified repetition) of a child's ungrammatical utterance.

== Explicit direct negative evidence ==
A [[Corpus linguistics|corpus study]] found that explicit negative evidence was "very rare", and concluded that because parents do not reliably correct their children's grammatical errors, explicit negative evidence does not facilitate language learning.&lt;ref name=":8"&gt;Brown, R., &amp; Hanlon, C. (1970). Derivational complexity and order of acquisition on child speech. In J. Hayes (Ed.), Cognition and the developmenf of language (pp. 11-53). New York: Wiley.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/ref&gt;  Psychologist [[David McNeill]] argues that when parents correct children explicitly, the correction is unlikely to be helpful in learning grammar because it is a single correction that will most likely not be repeated, and therefore a child might not remember or even notice the correction.&lt;ref name=":10" /&gt; This is demonstrated in the following exchange between a parent and child, which McNeill recorded:&lt;blockquote&gt;
:Child: Nobody don't like me.
:Mother: No, say, "nobody likes me."
:Child: Nobody don't like me.
:[This exchange is repeated several times]
:Mother: No, now listen carefully. Say, "Nobody likes me."
:Child: Oh! Nobody don't ''likes'' me.&lt;ref name=":10"&gt;McNeill, D. (1966) Developmental Psycholinguistics. in&amp;nbsp; The Genesis of Language, F. Smith and G. Miller (eds). MIT Press.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;As this conversation reveals, children are seemingly unable to detect differences between their ungrammatical sentences and the grammatical sentences that their parents produce. Therefore, children typically cannot use explicit negative evidence to learn that an aspect of grammar, such as using double negatives in English, is ungrammatical. This example also shows that children can make incorrect generalizations about which grammatical principle a parent corrects, suggesting that there must be something other than explicit feedback which drives children to arrive at a correct grammar.

== Implicit direct negative evidence ==
===In the input ===
Implicit direct negative evidence occurs when a parent responds to a child's ungrammatical utterance in a way that indicates that the utterance was not grammatical. This differs from explicit direct negative evidence because the parent merely implies that the child's utterance is ungrammatical, while explicit direct negative evidence involves a parent unambiguously telling a child that a sentence they produced is ungrammatical. There are several types of implicit direct negative evidence which parents utilize in responses to children's ungrammatical utterances.&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt; These forms include: repetitions, recasts, expansions, and requests for clarification.  Repetitions occur when a parent repeats a child's utterance word for word, whereas recasts occur when a parent repeats a child's utterance while correcting the ungrammatical part of the sentence.  Expansions are similar to recasts because they are potentially corrective utterances, but in expansions a parent also will lengthen the child's original utterance. Requests for clarification occur when a parent asks a question that can prompt a child to fix an ungrammatical sentence they previously said. Generally speaking, there is consensus that implicit direct negative evidence exists in the input, though there is debate about whether children can use implicit direct negative evidence to learn the grammar of their language. It is argued that parents frequently reformulate children's ungrammatical utterances.&lt;ref name=":7"&gt;Saxton, Matthew.&amp;nbsp;[http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1177/014272370002006001 "Negative evidence and negative feedback: immediate effects on the grammaticality of child speech"].&amp;nbsp;''First Language''.&amp;nbsp;'''20'''&amp;nbsp;(60): 221–252.&amp;nbsp;[[Digital object identifier|doi]]:[https://doi.org/10.1177%2F014272370002006001 10.1177/014272370002006001].&lt;/ref&gt;

===Utility===
Some types of implicit direct negative evidence, such as reformulations, occur regularly in the input, thus making them potentially usable forms of evidence. It is the presence of the reformulations, as well as the high percentage of correct parental speech, that allows children to learn.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;Chouinard, Michelle M.; Clark, Eve V. (2003/08).&amp;nbsp;[https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/journal-of-child-language/article/adult-reformulations-of-child-errors-as-negative-evidence/AC1DA451B23BDDCE589273617D8B4F4C "Adult reformulations of child errors as negative evidence"].&amp;nbsp;''Journal of Child Language''.&amp;nbsp;'''30'''&amp;nbsp;(3): 637–669.&amp;nbsp;[[Digital object identifier|doi]]:[https://doi.org/10.1017%2Fs0305000903005701 10.1017/s0305000903005701].&amp;nbsp;[[International Standard Serial Number|ISSN]]&amp;nbsp;[https://www.worldcat.org/issn/1469-7602 1469-7602]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Snow, C.E.; Ferguson, C. A., eds. (1977).&amp;nbsp;''Talking to Children: language input and acquisition''. Cambridge Press.&lt;/ref&gt; Some studies have demonstrated that parents respond differently when children utter grammatical or ungrammatical utterances, and the researchers who conducted these studies believe that children can use this parental feedback to learn grammar because corrective and non-corrective parental feedback can be distinguished from each other.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Penner, Sharon (April 1987). "Parental Responses to Grammatical and Ungrammatical Child Utterances".&amp;nbsp;''Child Development''. 58, Issue 2: 376–385.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt; Some evidence also supports the hypothesis that children actually use implicit direct negative evidence in practice (see section below).&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt;

Though there have been a number of studies that support the hypothesis that children can use implicit direct negative evidence that exists in the input, there have also been studies which stand in stark contrast to this hypothesis.&lt;ref name=":9"&gt;Rhode, Douglas L.T.; Plaut, David C. (Spring 1999).&amp;nbsp;[https://ac.els-cdn.com/S0010027799000311/1-s2.0-S0010027799000311-main.pdf?_tid=eca927c4-be6c-11e7-a5a2-00000aab0f01&amp;acdnat=1509476249_3347feb9cae9a697da5b6075cb8de74a "Language acquisition in the absence of explicit negative evidence: how important is starting small?"]&amp;nbsp;(PDF).&amp;nbsp;''Cognition''.&amp;nbsp;'''72''': 67–109&lt;/ref&gt; Linguists who do not believe that implicit direct negative evidence is helpful for a language learner argue that studies supporting the utility of implicit direct negative evidence do not properly specify which types of utterances qualify as recasts. They criticize the fact that some types of implicit direct negative evidence are not necessarily corrective (i.e. parental responses that may qualify as implicit direct negative evidence can occur after either grammatical or ungrammatical utterances). Additionally, some of these linguists question how children would know to only pay attention to certain kinds of recasts and not others.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

Furthermore, [[Gary Marcus]] argues that implicit direct negative evidence in the input is insufficient for children to learn the correct grammar of their language.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;Marcus, G. F. (January 1993).&amp;nbsp;[https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/8432090 "Negative evidence in language acquisition"].&amp;nbsp;''Cognition''.&amp;nbsp;'''46'''&amp;nbsp;(1): 53–85.&amp;nbsp;[[International Standard Serial Number|ISSN]]&amp;nbsp;[https://www.worldcat.org/issn/0010-0277 0010-0277].&amp;nbsp;[[PubMed Identifier|PMID]]&amp;nbsp;[https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/8432090 8432090].&lt;/ref&gt; He criticizes negative evidence because it does not explain why sentences are ungrammatical, thus making it difficult for children to learn what their correct grammar is. He also argues that for children to be able to even use implicit direct negative evidence, they would need to repeat a sentence 85 times and receive negative feedback in order to eliminate that sentence from their vocabulary. He then shows that children typically do not repeat ungrammatical utterances in such high quantities; therefore, language learners would not be able to benefit from implicit evidence. Marcus also purports that implicit evidence is largely unavailable because the feedback differs from parent to parent, and is inconsistent in both the frequency with which it is offered and the kinds of errors it corrects. Other studies demonstrate that implicit negative evidence decreases over time, so that as children get older there is less feedback, making it less available and, consequentially, less likely to be used in or account for children's unlearning of grammatical errors.&lt;ref&gt;Hirsh-Pasek, K., Treiman, R., &amp; Schneiderman, M. (1984). Brown and Hanlon revisited: Mothers’

sensitivity to ungrammatical forms. Journal of Child Language, 11, 81-88.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Usage===
Assuming that implicit direct negative evidence is usable, there are some studies which demonstrate that children do use implicit direct negative evidence to correct their grammatical mistakes.  For example, experiments show that children produce a greater number of grammatical sentences when parents provide them with any type of immediate implicit direct negative evidence, including recasts. This evidence supports claims that direct negative evidence assists a child in their language learning.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt; Chouinard also found that children are highly attentive to parental responses and that children respond to implicit correction in predictable ways.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;  Children tend to directly respond to these reformulations by either affirming the reformulation or disagreeing with their parent if the parent misunderstood the child's intended meaning, revealing that children can discern when parental feedback is meant to correct their grammatical errors. Additionally, children have been shown correct their initial errors when a parent recasts a child's morphological error.&lt;ref&gt;Farrar, Michael J.&amp;nbsp;[http://doi.apa.org/getdoi.cfm?doi=10.1037/0012-1649.28.1.90 "Negative evidence and grammatical morpheme acquisition"].&amp;nbsp;''Developmental Psychology''.&amp;nbsp;'''28'''&amp;nbsp;(1): 90–98.&amp;nbsp;[[Digital object identifier|doi]]:[https://doi.org/10.1037%2F0012-1649.28.1.90 10.1037/0012-1649.28.1.90].&lt;/ref&gt;

However, other researchers have conducted studies that demonstrate that children do not ''need'' negative feedback in order to learn language.&lt;ref&gt;Bohannon, John N.; MacWhinney, Brian; Snow, Catherine.&amp;nbsp;[http://doi.apa.org/getdoi.cfm?doi=10.1037/0012-1649.26.2.221 "No negative evidence revisited: Beyond learnability or who has to prove what to whom"].&amp;nbsp;''Developmental Psychology''.&amp;nbsp;'''26'''&amp;nbsp;(2): 221–226.&amp;nbsp;[[Digital object identifier|doi]]:[https://doi.org/10.1037%2F0012-1649.26.2.221 10.1037/0012-1649.26.2.221].&lt;/ref&gt; This is evidenced in a case study in which a mute child was tested to see whether he could comprehend a grammar even though he had received no corrective feedback (since corrective feedback occurs as a response to ungrammatical sentences that children produce). Though the child did not produce any speech and therefore did not receive any negative feedback, researchers found that he was able to learn grammatical rules. Although this study does not answer whether negative evidence can be helpful for learning language, it does suggest that direct negative evidence is not needed to learn grammar. Another study also demonstrates that implicit negative evidence is a negative predictor of the rate at which children eliminated ungrammatical utterances from their speech.&lt;ref&gt;Morgan, J. L., Bonamo, K. M., &amp; Travis, L. L. (1995). Negative evidence on negative evidence.&amp;nbsp;''Developmental Psychology'',&amp;nbsp;''31''(2), 180-197. doi:10.1037/0012-1649.31.2.180&lt;/ref&gt;

== Direct negative evidence in language learning ==
Though there is no consensus regarding whether there is sufficient and usable implicit negative evidence in the input, if children ''are'' exposed to direct negative evidence, then they could use that evidence to validate hypotheses they have made about their grammar. On the other hand, if there is not sufficient usable negative evidence in the input, then there is a "no negative evidence" problem, which questions of how a language learner can learn language without negative evidence. This is a problem because if a child only hears grammatical sentences which are consistent with multiple grammars, then it would be impossible to determine which grammar is correct unless there was some other factor influencing what grammar a child ultimately hypothesizes to be correct.

Proponents of [[Psychological nativism#Language|linguistic nativism]] suggest that the answer to the "no negative evidence" problem is that language knowledge that cannot be learned is innate. They argue that the language input is not rich enough for children to develop a fully developed grammar from the input alone. This view is referred to as the&amp;nbsp;[[poverty of the stimulus]] argument. The central idea of the poverty of the stimulus argument is that children could have multiple hypotheses about aspects of their grammar which are distinguishable only by negative evidence (or by hearing ungrammatical sentences and recognizing those sentences as ungrammatical). Supporters of the poverty of the stimulus argument assert that because the negative evidence that is needed to learn language by the input alone does not exist, children cannot learn certain aspects of grammar from the input alone, and therefore there must be some aspects of grammar which involve innate mechanisms.&lt;ref&gt;Lasnik, Howard; Lidz, Jeffrey L. (2016-12-22).&amp;nbsp;[http://oxfordhandbooks.com/view/10.1093/oxfordhb/9780199573776.001.0001/oxfordhb-9780199573776-e-10 ''The Argument from the Poverty of the Stimulus''].&amp;nbsp;[[Digital object identifier|doi]]:[https://doi.org/10.1093%2Foxfordhb%2F9780199573776.013.10 10.1093/oxfordhb/9780199573776.013.10].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Baker, C. L. (1979).&amp;nbsp;[https://www.jstor.org/stable/4178133 "Syntactic Theory and the Projection Problem"].&amp;nbsp;''Linguistic Inquiry''.&amp;nbsp;'''10'''&amp;nbsp;(4): 533–581.&amp;nbsp;[[Digital object identifier|doi]]:[https://doi.org/10.2307%2F4178133 10.2307/4178133].&lt;/ref&gt;

== Indirect negative evidence in language acquisition ==
'''Indirect negative evidence in language acquisition''' is information about the grammatical structure of their own language drawn from what the language learner does not hear in speech. Indirect negative evidence serves as a means for child language learners to constrain and refine hypotheses that they previously held about the structure of their language.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Child Language: Acquisition and Growth|last=Lust|first=Barbara|date=2007|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=0521449227|pages=30–31|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Examples of indirect negative evidence ==
===General examples===
Indirect negative evidence can be used for more than just language learning. The calculation of probability based on observed occurrences, called [[Bayesian inference]], serves many purposes. For example, when we see a dog bark, we are likely to think that dogs bark, not that every kind of animal barks. This is because we have never seen horses or fish or any other animal bark, so our hypothesis becomes that only dogs bark.&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Regier|first=Terry|last2=Gahl|first2=Susanne|title=Learning the unlearnable: the role of missing evidence|url=https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cognition.2003.12.003|journal=Cognition|language=en|volume=93|issue=2|pages=147–155|doi=10.1016/j.cognition.2003.12.003}}&lt;/ref&gt; We use this same inference to assume that the sun will rise tomorrow, having seen it rise every other day so far. No evidence received indicates that the sun may not rise once every two thousand years, or only rises on years that are not 2086, but since all evidence seen so far is consistent with the universal generalization, we infer that the sun does indeed rise every day.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;

===Examples in language acquisition===
Regier &amp; Gahl argue that certain Poverty of the Stimulus problems could be overcome by using indirect negative evidence. For example, syntacticians argue that children could not learn that "one" is anaphoric to phrasal categories given that the evidence they are exposed to is equally consistent with "one" being anaphoric only to individual words. This is because the meanings produced by the phrasal hypothesis are a subset of those produced by the single word hypothesis. Children could thus use the fact that all of their data is consistent with both hypotheses as evidence in favor of the more restricted hypothesis.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;

==Utility of indirect negative evidence==
===Indirect negative evidence and word learning===
Child and adult speakers rely on 'suspicious coincidences' when learning a new word meaning.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Xu|first1=Fei|last2=Tenebaum|first2=Joshua|title=Word Learning as Bayesian Inference|journal=Psychological Review|date=2007|volume=114|doi=10.1037/0033-295X.114.2.245}}&lt;/ref&gt; When learning a new word meaning, children and adults use only the first few instances of hearing that word in order to decide what it means, rapidly constricting their hypothesis if only used in a narrow context. In an experiment conducted by Xu and Tenebaum, 4-year-old participants learning a novel word 'fep' readily decided that it referred only to Dalmatians if only hearing it while shown pictures of Dalmatians; although they received no information that 'fep' was unable to refer to other kinds of dogs, the suspicious coincidence that they had never heard it in other contexts caused them to restrict their meaning to just one breed.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

Child language learners can use this same type of probabilistic inference to decide when and how verbs can be used. A word children hear often, like 'disappear', is more likely to be used than a less common word with a similar meaning, 'vanish'. Children studied said that the ungrammatical sentence "*We want to disappear our heads" was ungrammatical, but when given the same sentence with vanish, they were less sure of the grammaticality.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Ambridge|first=Ben|last2=Pine|first2=J.M.|last3=Rowland|first3=C.F.|last4=Young|first4=C.R.|title=The effect of verb semantic class and verb frequency (entrenchment) on children’s and adults’ graded judgements of argument-structure overgeneralization errors.|url=https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cognition.2006.12.015|journal=Cognition|language=en|volume=106|issue=1|pages=87–129|doi=10.1016/j.cognition.2006.12.015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Given the frequency of 'disappear' in intransitive clauses, learners could infer that if it were possible in transitive clauses, they would have heard it in those contexts. Thus, the high frequency of the intransitive use leads to the inference that the transitive is impossible.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://pubman.mpdl.mpg.de/pubman/item/escidoc:468143/component/escidoc:532427/bowerman_1988_The-No.pdf|title=Explaining Language Universals|last=Bowerman|first=1988|publisher=Basil Blackwell|year=1988|isbn=|location=Oxford|pages=73–101}}&lt;/ref&gt; This inference is less reliable with a less frequent verb like "vanish".

===Indirect negative evidence and syntax===
It has been argued that children use indirect negative evidence to make probabilistic inferences about the syntax of the language they are acquiring. A 2004 study by Regier &amp; Gahl produced a computational model which provides support for this argument.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; They assert that children can use the ''absence'' of particular patterns in the input in order to conclude that such patterns are illicit. According to Regier and Gahl, young language learners form hypotheses about what is and isn't correct based on probabilistic inferences. As children are exposed to more and more examples of a certain phenomenon, their hypothesis space narrows. Notably, Regier and Gahl assert that this ability for probabilistic inference can be used in all sorts of general learning tasks, and not just linguistic ones. Regier and Gahl also present their model as evidence against an argument from the poverty of the stimulus, because their model illustrates that syntactic learning is possible from using the input alone, and does not necessarily require some innate linguistic knowledge of syntax.

The '''New Soviet man''' or '''New Soviet person''' ({{lang-ru|новый советский человек}} ''novy sovetsky chelovek''), as postulated by the [[State ideology of the Soviet Union|ideologists]] of the [[Communist Party of the Soviet Union]], was an [[archetype]] of a person with specific qualities that were said to be emerging as dominant among all citizens of the [[Soviet Union]], irrespective of the country's cultural, ethnic, and linguistic diversity, creating a single [[Soviet people]], Soviet nation.&lt;ref&gt;[[Nikolay Vasilyevich Ustryalov|Nikolay Ustryalov]], ''From [[New Economic Policy|NEP]] to Soviet Socialism'' (1934) ([http://www.magister.msk.ru/library/philos/ustryalov/ustry035.htm text online]) {{ru icon}} {{Page needed|date=July 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For example, [[Leon Trotsky]] wrote in 1924 in ''[[Literature and Revolution]]'' about the "Communist man", "man of the future":&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.marxists.org/archive/trotsky/1924/lit_revo/ch08.htm |title=Ch. 8 '&amp;#39;Revolutionary and Socialist Art |publisher=Marxists.org |date=2007-01-06 |accessdate=2012-08-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|Man will make it his purpose to master his own feelings, to raise his instincts to the heights of consciousness, to make them transparent, to extend the wires of his will into hidden recesses, and thereby to raise himself to a new plane, to create a higher social biologic type, or, if you please, a superman.}}

[[Wilhelm Reich]] asked in 1933: 

&lt;blockquote&gt;Will the new socio-economic system reproduce itself in the structure of the people's character? If so, how? Will his traits be inherited by his children? Will he be a free, self-regulating personality? Will the elements of freedom incorporated into the structure of the personality make any authoritarian forms of government unnecessary?&lt;ref&gt;[[Wilhelm Reich]], ''The Mass Psychology of Fascism'', Chapter 8, ''Masses and the State'' {{Page needed|date=July 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Author and philosopher [[Bernard Byhovsky]], Ph.D. writes: "The new man is endowed, first of all, with a new ethical outlook." &lt;ref&gt;Bernard Bykhovsky, ''The New Man in the Making'' (Moscow: Novosti Press Agency Publishing House) {{Page needed|date=July 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==The New Man==
[[File:1988 CPA 6017.jpg|thumb|250px|''[[Worker and Kolkhoz Woman]]'' commemorated in a Soviet stamp in [[Socialist realism|Socialist realist]] style.]]
The Soviet man was to be selfless, learned, healthy, muscular, and enthusiastic in spreading the [[Socialism|socialist]] [[Proletarian revolution|Revolution]]. Adherence to [[Marxism-Leninism]], and individual behavior consistent with that philosophy's prescriptions, were among the crucial traits expected of the New Soviet man, which required intellectualism and hard discipline.&lt;ref&gt;[[B. R. Myers]], ''The Cleanest Race'', p 81 {{ISBN|9781933633916}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was not driven by crude impulses of nature but by conscious self-mastery, a belief that required the rejection of both innate personality and the unconscious, which Soviet psychologists therefore rejected.&lt;ref&gt;Richard Overy, ''The Dictators: Hitler's Germany, Stalin's Russia'', p258 {{ISBN|0-393-02030-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He treated public property with respect, as if it were his own.&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.roca.org/OA/76-77/76f.htm 1917-1987: Unsuccessful and Tragic Attempt to Create a “New Man”]"&lt;/ref&gt;  He also has lost any nationalist sentiments, being Soviet rather than Russian, Ukrainian, Belarusian, or any of the many other nationalities found in the USSR.&lt;ref&gt;"[http://lcweb2.loc.gov/frd/cs/soviet_union/su_glos.html Glossary -- Soviet Union]"&lt;/ref&gt;

His work required exertion and austerity, to show the new man triumphing over his base instincts.&lt;ref&gt;B. R. Myers, ''The Cleanest Race'', p 86 {{ISBN|9781933633916}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Alexey Stakhanov]]'s spurious&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1985/08/31/world/in-soviet-eager-beaver-s-legend-works-overtime.html |first=Serge |last=Schmemann |title=In Soviet, Eager Beaver's Legend Works Overtime |work=The New York Times |date=31 August 1985 |page=2 &lt;!-- section 1, column 3 --&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Komsomolskaya Pravda]], October 15, 1988&lt;/ref&gt; record-breaking day in mining coal caused him to be set forth as the exemplar of the "new man" and the members of [[Stakhanovite movement]]s tried to become Stakhanovites.&lt;ref&gt;[[Richard Overy]], ''The Dictators: Hitler's Germany, Stalin's Russia'', p258-9 {{ISBN|0-393-02030-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This could also be a new woman; ''[[Pravda]]'' described the Soviet woman as someone who had and could never have existed before.&lt;ref&gt;Richard Overy, ''The Dictators: Hitler's Germany, Stalin's Russia'', p259 {{ISBN|0-393-02030-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Female Stakhanovites were rarer than male, but a quarter of all trade-union women were designated as "norm-breaking."&lt;ref name="overy260"&gt;Richard Overy, ''The Dictators: Hitler's Germany, Stalin's Russia'', p260 {{ISBN|0-393-02030-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;  For the Paris World Fair, [[Vera Mukhina]] depicted a momentual sculpture, ''[[Worker and Kolkhoz Woman]]'', dressed in work clothing, pressing forward with his hammer and her sickle crossed.&lt;ref name="overy260"/&gt;

[[Aleksandr Zinovyev]] put forth the satirical argument that a new kind of person was indeed created by the Soviet system, but held that this new man - which they call ''[[Homo Sovieticus]]'' - was in many ways the opposite of the ideal of the New Soviet man.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url= http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/4760109.stm |title=Soviet-era satirist Zinovyev dies |publisher= BBC News|date= 2006-05-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Selflessness===
Among the major traits of a new Soviet man was [[Altruism|selfless]] [[collectivism]].  The selfless new man was willing to sacrifice his life for good causes.&lt;ref&gt;Richard Overy, ''The Dictators: Hitler's Germany, Stalin's Russia'', p301 {{ISBN|0-393-02030-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This trait was glorified from the first Soviet days, as exemplified by lines from the poem ''Vladimir Ilyich Lenin'' by the Soviet poet [[Vladimir Mayakovsky]]:

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;poem&gt;
Who needs a "1"?
The voice of a "1"
:is thinner than a squeak.
Who will hear it?
:Only the wife...
A "1" is nonsense.
:A "1" is zero.
&lt;/poem&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Fictional characters and presentations of contemporary celebrities embodying this model were prominent features of Soviet [[culture|cultural]] life, especially at times when fostering the concept of the New Soviet man was given special priority by the government.

[[Pro-natalist]] policies encouraging women to have many children were justified by the selfishness inherent in limiting the next generation of "new men."&lt;ref&gt;Richard Overy, ''The Dictators: Hitler's Germany, Stalin's Russia'', p257 {{ISBN|0-393-02030-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==New Soviet Woman==
[[File:SovietWoman1920.jpg|thumb|250px|"What the [[October Revolution]] gave to the female worker and peasant". 1920 Soviet propaganda poster. The inscriptions on the buildings read "library", "kindergarten", "school for grown-ups", etc.]]
In the 1920s and into the Stalinist era the concept of the "New Soviet Woman" served alongside that of the "New Soviet Man." Her roles were vastly different than that of her male counterpart; she was burdened with a complex identity that changed with ideology shifts in the party doctrine toward more [[conservative]] notions of the role of the family and the mother in the Soviet system. The New Soviet Woman was a Superwoman who balanced competing responsibilities and took on the burden of multiple roles: Communist citizen, full-time worker, wife and mother.&lt;ref name="BarbaraEvansC"&gt;Barbara Evans Clements, Daughters of the Revolution: A History of Women in the U.S.S.R. (Illinois: Harlan Davidson, Inc., 1994), 73.&lt;/ref&gt;

The New Soviet Person was generally characterized as male. In [[Propaganda in the Soviet Union|Soviet propaganda]] centered on the New Soviet Person, it was standard for men to be depicted as the primary actors, either battling opponents of the Marxist revolution or rebuilding the world. Women, on the other hand, were often portrayed as "backward," passive beneficiaries of the revolution rather than its securers. This was so not least because the proletarian movement was organized and fought by the working class, which by and large consisted of men.{{Citation needed|date=January 2012}} Thus, propaganda often equated male domination with proletariat domination. Although the party leadership claimed the sexes enjoyed equal status under the law, a significant accomplishment in itself, men remained the measure of worth.&lt;ref&gt;Barbara Alpern Engel, Women in Russia: 1700-2000 (Cambridge University Press, 2004), 150.&lt;/ref&gt;

This marginalization of women in the newly developing civil order made it difficult for women to find a place among the proletarian class for which the revolution was fought. Regulations during the [[New Economic Policy]] period on the extent to which women could work in dangerous conditions, how many hours they could work in a shift and the kinds of special care they received during maternity made many factory owners reluctant to hire women, despite the Commissariat of Labor's requirements that women to be given equal access to employment.&lt;ref&gt;Barbara Alpern Engel, Women in Russia: 1700-2000 (Cambridge University Press, 2004), 153.&lt;/ref&gt;

There were gains made in combating illiteracy and promoting education for women during the 1920s. Soviet policy encouraged working-class women to attend school and develop vocational skills. There existed opportunities for women to participate in politics, become party members and vie for elected and administrative positions. Access to the political sphere, however, was extremely limited.&lt;ref name="Gail Warshofsky Lapidus 1978"&gt;Gail Warshofsky Lapidus, Women in Soviet Society: Equality, Development, and Social Change (University of California Press, 1978), 112.&lt;/ref&gt;

Joseph Stalin's policies on women were more conservative than that of his predecessor Lenin. Because he was concerned with a declining population rate, Stalin de-emphasized the Marxist feminist view of women in society, which, in his view, freed women from patriarchy and capitalism. In keeping with the party line, Stalin reasserted the importance of women in the workforce and female education, primarily literacy, although he began to emphasize the role of mother in a way that differed from more radical notions of the early 1920s.&lt;ref name="Gail Warshofsky Lapidus 1978"/&gt;

The "withering away" of the family was no longer a goal of economic and political progress. The new party line was that the family, like the state, was to grow stronger with the full realization of socialism. Massive propaganda campaigns linked the joys of motherhood with the benefits of Soviet power.&lt;ref name="Gail Warshofsky Lapidus 1978"/&gt; Soviet ideology began to argue that women's public roles were compatible with her roles as wife and mother. In fact, that the two reinforced one another and were both necessary for real womanhood.&lt;ref&gt;Gail Warshofsky Lapidus, Women in Soviet Society: Equality, Development, and Social Change (University of California Press, 1978), 115.&lt;/ref&gt;

The New Soviet Woman differed greatly from the conceptions of revolutionaries preceding the 1930s. Instead of being freed from domestic concerns, she was bound to them. Though she now filled the role of man's peer in the workplace, she was also obligated to devote herself to being his helpmate in the home.&lt;ref name="BarbaraEvansC"/&gt; One of the primary roles of the New Soviet Woman was that of mother. This role became of great importance in the wake of population decline beginning in the 1920s. War and revolution had decimated the population. Legislation legalizing abortions and the increasing use of contraception—though still not that widespread—in the 1920s also contributed to the lower population numbers as women began to work more and give birth less.&lt;ref name="Barbara Alpern Engel 2004"&gt;Barbara Alpern Engel, Women in Russia: 1700-2000 (Cambridge University Press, 2004), 161.&lt;/ref&gt;

As a means to combat that trend, propaganda placed a new emphasis on the female's role as the perpetuator of the Communist regime in their ability to produce the next class of healthy workers, a policy called [[pronatalism]]. Propaganda presented pronatalism, a means to encourage women to bear children, in different ways to urban working-class women and to rural peasant women. Propaganda designed for an urban audience linked healthy female sexuality with reproduction while medical information to peasant women positioned conception as the purpose of sexual intercourse.&lt;ref name="Barbara Alpern Engel 2004"/&gt;

The new ideal Soviet woman appealed to many Soviet women. Many had found Marxist feminism difficult to swallow and preferred their traditional female roles.&lt;ref&gt;Barbara Evans Clements, Daughters of the Revolution: A History of Women in the U.S.S.R. (Illinois: Harlan Davidson, Inc., 1994), 74.&lt;/ref&gt; Although these women drew satisfaction from their role as mothers, they appreciated the opportunity afforded them by the Communist ideology to dismantle the oppression that often went hand-in-hand with domestic life.{{Citation needed|date=July 2015}} With husbands that often beat, abused, and abandoned them{{Citation needed|date=July 2015}} and a society and government that looked down on them as intellectually and ideologically inferior prior to the Stalinist era{{Citation needed|date=July 2015}}, many women welcomed the ability to cast aside the stigma that came with their role as mother while retaining the status as an equal participant in society.{{Citation needed|date=July 2015}}

During the 1920s and into the Stalinist era, Soviet policy forced women to curtail their professional aspirations in order to fulfill their dual role as worker and housewife. Competing requirements of family life limited female occupational mobility. Women managed the role strain experienced during the Stalinist era either by either a restriction of professional aspirations or by limiting family size. Despite pitfalls, unprecedented opportunities were available to lower-class women during this time. Women now had a voice in debates and the Zhenotdel, the women's section of the Central Committee from 1919–1930, made strides during its operation to increase political, social and economic agency of Soviet women.&lt;ref&gt;Barbara Alpern Engel, Women in Russia: 1700-2000 (Cambridge University Press, 2004), 165.&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Ngbandi language''' is a [[dialect continuum]] of the [[Ubangian languages|Ubangian family]] spoken by a half-million or so people in the [[Democratic Republic of Congo]] (Ngbandi proper) and in the [[Central African Republic]] (Yakoma and others). It is primarily spoken by the [[Ngbandi people]], which included the dictator of what was then known as [[Zaire]], [[Mobutu Sese Seko]].

Northern Ngbandi is the lexical source of the [[trade language]] [[Sango language|Sango]], which has as many native speakers as Ngbandi and which is used as a second language by millions more in the CAR.

'''Yakoma''', with a central position on the [[Ubangi River]] that divides the CAR from the DRC, has a high degree of intelligibility with all other varieties of Ngbandi, though as with any dialect continuum, it does not follow that more distant varieties are necessarily as intelligible with each other as they are with Yakoma.

A variety of Ngbandi may have been spoken further east, in the DRC villages of Kazibati and Mongoba&lt;ref&gt;Linguasphere code 93-ABB-ae/af&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Glottolog|mong1345|Mongoba-Kazibati}}&lt;/ref&gt; near Uganda, until the late 20th century, but this is uncertain.

In computer technology and [[telecommunications]], '''online''' indicates a state of connectivity''',''' and '''offline''' indicates a disconnected state. In modern terminology this usually refers to an [[Internet connection]], but (especially when expressed "on line" or "on the line") could refer to any piece of equipment or functional unit that is connected to a larger system.  Being online means that the equipment or subsystem is connected, or that it is ready for use.&lt;ref&gt;[[Federal Standard 1037C]] [https://www.its.bldrdoc.gov/fs-1037/fs-1037c.htm]&lt;/ref&gt;

"Online" has come to describe activities performed on and data available on the Internet,&lt;ref name=ox&gt;{{cite web|title=online|url=http://www.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/english/online|website=Dictionary of British and World English|publisher=Oxford University Press|accessdate=31 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; for example: "[[online identity]]", "[[online predator]]", "[[online gambling]]", "[[online shopping]]", "[[online banking]]", and "[[E-learning|online learning]]". Similar meaning is also given by the prefixes "cyber" and "e", as in the words "[[cyberspace]]", "[[cybercrime]]", "[[email]]", and "[[ecommerce]]".&lt;ref name=thesau&gt;{{cite web|title=Synonyms of online in English:|url=http://www.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/american_english-thesaurus/online|website=Oxford Dictionary|publisher=Oxford University Press|accessdate=31 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In contrast, "offline" can refer to either computing activities performed while disconnected from the Internet, or alternatives to Internet activities (such as shopping in [[brick-and-mortar]] stores). The term "offline" is sometimes used interchangeably with the acronym "IRL", meaning "in real life".&lt;ref&gt;http://www.denofgeek.com/uk/other/internet/52766/19-things-we-miss-about-the-early-days-of-the-web&lt;/ref&gt;

==Antecedents==
During the 19th century, the term "on line" was commonly used in both the railroad and telegraph industries. For railroads, a signal box would send messages down the line (track), via a telegraph line (cable), indicating the track's status: "Train on line" or "Line clear".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=nEcKAAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=RA1-PA33&amp;dq=%22train+on+line%22 |title=Great Britain Railways: Accidents. Court of Inquiry Reports |publisher= |author=Great Britain Board of Trade |year=1874 |page=33 |accessdate=April 8, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Telegraph linemen would refer to sending current through a line as "direct on line" or "battery on line";&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=A4A3AQAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA172&amp;dq=%22on+line%22+telegraph |title=Journal of the Society of Telegraph Engineers: Including Original Communications on Telegraphy and Electrical Science, Volume 8 |publisher= |author=Society of Telegraph Engineers |year=1879 |page=172 |accessdate=April 8, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; or they may refer to a problem with the circuit as being "on line", as opposed to the power source or end-point equipment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=yxgAAAAAQAAJ&amp;pg=PA47&amp;dq=%22on+line%22+telegraph+battery |title=The practical telegraphist and guide to the telegraph service |publisher= |author=William Lynd |year=1885 |page=47 |accessdate=April 8, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Examples==

===Offline e-mail===
One example of a common use of these concepts with email is a [[mail user agent]] (MUA) that can be instructed to be in either online or offline states.  One such MUA is [[Microsoft Outlook]]. When online it will attempt to connect to mail servers (to check for new mail at regular intervals, for example), and when offline it will not attempt to make any such connection. The online or offline state of the MUA does not necessarily reflect the connection status between the computer on which it is running and the internet. That is, the computer itself may be online—connected to Internet via a [[cable modem]] or other means—while Outlook is kept offline by the user, so that it makes no attempt to send or to receive messages. Similarly, a computer may be configured to employ a [[dial-up Internet access|dial-up connection]] on demand (as when an application such as Outlook attempts to make connection to a server), but the user may not wish for Outlook to trigger that call whenever it is configured to check for mail.&lt;ref name="Mann"&gt;{{cite book|pages=76&amp;ndash;77|title=How to Do Everything with Microsoft Office Outlook 2003|author=Bill Mann|publisher=McGraw-Hill Professional|year=2003|isbn=0-07-223070-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Offline media playing===
Another example of the use of these concepts is [[digital audio]] technology. A tape recorder, [[digital audio editor]], or other device that is online is one whose clock is under the control of the clock of a synchronization master device. When the sync master commences playback, the online device automatically synchronizes itself to the master and commences playing from the same point in the recording. A device that is offline uses no external clock reference and relies upon its own internal clock. When a large number of devices are connected to a sync master it is often convenient, if one wants to hear just the output of one single device, to take it offline because, if the device is played back online, all synchronized devices have to locate the playback point and wait for each other device to be in synchronization.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Audiopro Home Recording Course: A Comprehensive Multimedia Audio Recording Text|author=Bill Gibson|pages=155|year=1998|publisher=Hal Leonard|isbn=0-87288-715-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; (For related discussion, see [[MIDI timecode]], [[word sync]], and recording system synchronization.)

===Offline browsing===
{{main|Offline browsing|}}
A third example of a common use of these concepts is a [[web browser]] that can be instructed to be in either online or offline states. The browser attempts to fetch pages from servers while only in the online state. In the offline state, users can perform '''offline browsing''', where pages can be browsed using local copies of those pages that have previously been downloaded while in the online state. This can be useful when the computer is offline and connection to the Internet is impossible or undesirable. The pages are downloaded either implicitly into the web browser's own [[browser cache|cache]] as a result of prior online browsing by the user or explicitly by a browser configured to keep local copies of certain web pages, which are updated when the browser is in the online state, either by checking that the local copies are up-to-date at regular intervals or by checking that the local copies are up-to-date whenever the browser is switched to the online state. One such web browser capable of being explicitly configured to download pages for offline browsing is [[Internet Explorer]]. When pages are added to the Favourites list, they can be marked to be "available for offline browsing". Internet Explorer will download to local copies both the marked page and, optionally, all of the pages that it links to. In Internet Explorer version 6, the level of direct and indirect links, the maximum amount of local disc space allowed to be consumed, and the schedule on which local copies are checked to see whether they are up-to-date, are configurable for each individual Favourites entry.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Good Web Guide|author=Arabella Dymoke|year=2004|publisher=The Good Web Guide Ltd|isbn=1-903282-46-2|pages=17|chapter=an a to z of internet terms}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Complete Idiot's Guide to Wireless Computing and Networking|author=Paul Heltzel|chapter=Wireless Road Tricks|year=2002|publisher=Alpha Books|isbn=0-02-864287-2|pages=205}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Internet Companion: The Easy Australian Guide|author1=Glen Waller  |author2=Vanessa Waller |lastauthoramp=yes |year=2000|publisher=UNSW Press|isbn=0-86840-499-3|pages=110&amp;ndash;112}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Configuring and Troubleshooting Windows XP Professional|author=Brian Barber|year=2001|publisher=Syngress Publishing|isbn=1-928994-80-6|pages=285&amp;ndash;389|chapter=Configuring Internet Technologies}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For communities that lack adequate Internet connectivity—such as developing countries, rural areas, and prisons—offline information stores such as the [[eGranary]] Digital Library (a collection of approximately thirty million educational resources from more than two thousand web sites and hundreds of CD-ROMs) provide offline access to information.  Numerous organizations have developed, or are developing, flash memory chips with collections of educational materials for offline use in smartphones, tablets, and laptops.{{citation needed|date=January 2015}}

===Offline storage===
Likewise, [[offline storage]] is [[computer data storage]] that is not "available for immediate use on demand by the system without human intervention." Additionally, an otherwise online system that is powered down may be considered offline.

===Offline messages===
With the growing communication tools and media, the words offline and online are used very frequently. If a person is active over a messaging tool and is able to accept the messages it is termed as online message and if the person is not available and the message is left to view when the person is back, it is termed as offline message. In the same context, the person's availability is termed as online and non-availability is termed as offline.

==Generalisations==
Online and offline distinctions have been generalised from computing and telecommunication into the field of human interpersonal relationships. The distinction between what is considered online and what is considered offline has become a subject of study in the field of [[sociology]].&lt;ref name=Slater&gt;{{cite book|chapter=Social Relationships and Identity On-line and Off-line|title=Handbook of New Media: Social Shaping and Consequences of ICTs|editors=Leah, Sonia, Lievrouw, and Livingstone|author=Don Slater|pages=533&amp;ndash;543|year=2002|publisher=Sage Publications Inc|isbn=0-7619-6510-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The distinction between online and offline is conventionally seen as the distinction between [[computer-mediated communication]] and [[Face-to-face (philosophy)|face-to-face]] communication (e.g., [[face time]]), respectively. Online is virtuality or [[cyberspace]], and offline is reality (i.e., [[Real life (reality)|real life]] or [[meatspace]]). Slater states that this distinction is "obviously far too simple".&lt;ref name=Slater /&gt; To support his argument that the distinctions in relationships are more complex than a simple dichotomy of online versus offline, he observes that some people draw no distinction between an online relationship, such as indulging in [[cybersex]], and an offline relationship, such as being [[pen pal]]s.  He argues that even the [[telephone]] can be regarded as an online experience in some circumstances, and that the blurring of the distinctions between the uses of various technologies (such as [[personal digital assistant|PDA]] versus mobile phone, [[internet television]] versus internet, and telephone versus [[Voice over Internet Protocol]]) has made it "impossible to use the term ''online'' meaningfully in the sense that was employed by the first generation of Internet research".&lt;ref name=Slater /&gt;

Slater asserts that there are legal and regulatory pressures to reduce the distinction between online and offline, with a "general tendency to assimilate online to offline and erase the distinction," stressing, however, that this does not mean that online relationships are being reduced to ''pre-existing'' offline relationships. He conjectures that greater legal status may be assigned to online relationships (pointing out that contractual relationships, such as business transactions, online are already seen as just as "real" as their offline counterparts), although he states it to be hard to imagine courts awarding [[palimony]] to people who have had a purely online sexual relationship. He also conjectures that an online/offline distinction may be seen by people as "rather quaint and not quite comprehensible" within 10 years.&lt;ref name=Slater /&gt;

This distinction between ''online'' and ''offline'' is sometimes inverted, with online concepts being used to define and to explain offline activities, rather than (as per the conventions of the [[desktop metaphor]] with its desktops, trash cans, folders, and so forth) the other way around. Several cartoons appearing in ''[[The New Yorker]]'' have satirized this. One includes [[Saint Peter]] asking for a username and a password before admitting a man into Heaven. Another illustrates "the off-line store" where "All items are actual size!", shoppers may "Take it home as soon as you pay for it!", and "Merchandise may be handled prior to purchase!"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|chapter=Introduction|title=Evolve: Succeeding in the digital culture of tomorrow|author=Rosabeth Moss Kanter|year=2001|publisher=Harvard Business School|isbn=1-57851-439-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://executiveeducation.wharton.upenn.edu/ebuzz/0508/images/cartoon2.jpg The "off-line store" cartoon from ''The New Yorker'']&lt;/ref&gt;

The following [[Outline (list)|outline]] is provided as an overview of and topical guide to BDSM:

'''[[BDSM]]''' &amp;ndash; a variety of erotic practices involving dominance and submission, roleplaying, restraint, and other interpersonal dynamics. Given the wide range of practices, some of which may be engaged in by people who do not consider themselves as practicing BDSM, inclusion in the BDSM community or subculture is usually dependent on self-identification and shared experience. Interest in BDSM can range from one-time experimentation to a lifestyle.

The '''Parser Grammar Engine''' ('''PGE''', originally the '''Parrot Grammar Engine''') is a [[compiler]] and [[Run-time system|runtime]] for a [[Perl 6 rules]] for the [[Parrot virtual machine]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://search.cpan.org/~ltoetsch/parrot-0.2.2/compilers/pge/README | title=Parrot Grammar Engine (PGE) | author=Michaud, Patrick R. | date=2004-11-22 | authorlink=Patrick R. Michaud | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20051220200247/http://search.cpan.org/~ltoetsch/parrot-0.2.2/compilers/pge/README | archivedate=2005-12-20 | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; PGE uses these ''rules'' to convert a [[parsing expression grammar]] into Parrot [[bytecode]]. It is therefore compiling rules into a program, unlike most virtual machines and runtimes, which store regular expressions in a secondary internal format that is then interpreted at runtime by a regular expression engine.  The rules format used by PGE can express any [[regular expression]] and most [[formal grammar]]s, and as such it forms the first link in the compiler chain for all of Parrot's front-end languages.

When executed, the bytecode generated by PGE will parse text as described in the input rules, generating a parse tree. The parse tree can be manipulated directly, or fed into the next stage of the [[Parrot compiler toolchain]] in order to generate an [[Abstract syntax tree|AST]] from which code generation can occur (if the grammar describes a programming language).

==History==
Originally named ''P6GE'' and written in C, PGE was translated to native Parrot and renamed not long after its initial release in November 2004. Its author is Patrick R. Michaud.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.nntp.perl.org/group/perl.perl6.compiler/96 | title=First public release of grammar engine | author=Michaud, Patrick R. | date=2004-11-08 | authorlink=Patrick R. Michaud}}&lt;/ref&gt; PGE was written in order to reduce the amount of work required to implement a compiler on top of Parrot. It was also written to allow Perl 6 to easily self-host, though current [[Pugs (programming)|Pugs]] development no longer uses PGE as its primary rules back-end in favor of a native engine called PCR.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://pugs.blogs.com/pugs/2006/09/pcr_replaces_pg.html | title=PCR replaces PGE in Pugs | author="Agent Zhang" | date=2006-09-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Internals==
PGE combines three styles of parsing:
* Perl 6 rules
* an [[Operator-precedence parser|operator precedence parser]]
* custom parse subroutines
The primary form is Perl 6 rules, so a PGE rule might look like this for an addition-only grammar:
&lt;source lang="perl6"&gt;
 rule term   { &lt;number&gt; | \( &lt;expr&gt; \) }
 rule number { \d+ }
 rule expr   { &lt;term&gt; ( '+' &lt;term&gt; )* }
&lt;/source&gt;
The operator precedence parser allows an operator table to be built and used directly in a Perl 6 rule style parser like so:
&lt;source lang="perl6"&gt;
 rule expr is optable { ... }
 rule term   { &lt;number&gt; | \( &lt;expr&gt; \) }
 rule number { \d+ }
 proto term: is precedence('=')
             is parsed(&amp;term) {...}
 proto infix:+ is looser('term:') {...}
&lt;/source&gt;
This accomplishes the same goal of defining a simple, addition-only grammar, but does so using a combination of a Perl 6 style regex/rules for &lt;code&gt;term&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;number&lt;/code&gt; and a shift-reduce optable for everything else.

=== Code generation ===
Though PGE outputs code which will parse the grammar described by a rule, and can be used at [[Run time (program lifecycle phase)|run time]] to handle simple grammars and regular expressions found in code, its primary purpose is for the parsing of [[high level language]]s.

The Parrot compiler toolchain is broken into several parts, of which PGE is the first. PGE converts source code to [[parse tree]]s. The [[Tree Grammar Engine]] (TGE) then converts these into Parrot Abstract Syntax Trees (PAST). A second TGE pass then converts a PAST into [[Parrot Opcode Syntax Trees]] (POST) which can be directly transformed into executable bytecode.

'''Gaius Plinius Caecilius Secundus''', born '''Gaius Caecilius''' or '''Gaius Caecilius Cilo''' (61 – c. 113), better known as '''Pliny the Younger''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|p|l|ɪ|n|i}}), was a lawyer, author, and magistrate of [[Ancient Rome]]. Pliny's uncle, [[Pliny the Elder]], helped raise and educate him.

Pliny the Younger wrote hundreds of letters, of which 247 survive and are of great historical value. Some are addressed to reigning emperors or to notables such as the historian [[Tacitus]]. Pliny served as an [[Executive magistrates of the Roman Empire|imperial magistrate]] under [[Trajan]] (reigned 98–117),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Bennett, Julian |title=Trajan: Optimus Princeps: A Life and Times|location=New York &amp; London|publisher=Routledge|date= 1997|pages= 113–125}}&lt;/ref&gt; and his letters to Trajan provide one of the few surviving records of the relationship between the imperial office and provincial governors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|encyclopedia=The Oxford Dictionary of the Classical World|year=2007|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=Oxford|isbn=9780192801463|url=http://www.oxfordreference.com/view/10.1093/acref/9780192801463.001.0001/acref-9780192801463-e-1750?rskey=6JozU6&amp;result=5|editor=John W.

Pliny rose through a series of civil and military offices, the ''[[cursus honorum]]''. He was a friend of the historian [[Tacitus]] and might have employed the biographer [[Suetonius]] on his staff. Pliny also came into contact with other well-known men of the period, including the philosophers [[Artemidorus]] and [[Euphrates the Stoic]], during his time in [[Syria]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

==Background==

===Childhood===
[[File:Jean-Baptiste-Camille Corot - Como and Lake Como.jpg|thumb|right|''Como and [[Lake Como]] in 1834'', painted by [[Jean-Baptiste-Camille Corot]]]]
Pliny the Younger was born in ''Novum Comum'' ([[Como]], Northern [[Italy (Roman Empire)|Italy]]) around 61 AD, the son of [[Caecilia (gens)|Lucius Caecilius Cilo]], born there, and his wife Plinia Marcella, a sister of [[Pliny the Elder]].&lt;ref name="salway"&gt;{{cite book|author=Salway, B. |date=1994|title=Journal of Roman Studies|volume=84|pages= 124–145}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was the grandson of [[Roman Senate|Senator]] and landowner Gaius Caecilius, revered his uncle, [[Pliny the Elder]] (who at this time was extremely famous around the Roman Empire), and provided sketches of how his uncle worked on the ''[[Naturalis Historia]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Pliny ''Letters'' 3.5.8–12. See English translation ([http://www.livius.org/pi-pm/pliny/pliny_e2.html Plinius the Elder (2)]) and Latin text ([http://www.thelatinlibrary.com/pliny.ep3.html C. PLINII CAECILII SECVNDI EPISTVLARVM LIBER TERTIVS]).&lt;/ref&gt;

Cilo died at an early age, when Pliny was still young.  As a result, the boy probably lived with his mother. His guardian and preceptor in charge of his education was [[Lucius Verginius Rufus]],{{citation needed|date=August 2016}} famed for quelling a revolt against [[Nero]] in 68 AD.
[[File:The Younger Pliny Reproved.jpg|thumb|left|''The Younger Pliny Reproved'', colorized copperplate print by Thomas Burke (1749–1815)]]
After being first tutored at home, Pliny went to Rome for further education. There he was taught [[rhetoric]] by [[Quintilian]], a great teacher and author, and Nicetes Sacerdos of Smyrna. It was at this time that Pliny became closer to his uncle Pliny the Elder. When Pliny the Younger was 17 or 18, his uncle Pliny the Elder died attempting to rescue victims of the [[Vesuvius]] eruption, and the terms of the Elder Pliny's will passed his estate to his nephew. In the same document the younger Pliny was [[adoption in ancient Rome|adopted]] by his uncle. As a result, Pliny the Younger changed his name from ''Gaius Caecilius Cilo'' to ''Gaius Plinius Caecilius Secundus'' (his official title was ''Gaius Plinius Luci filius Caecilius Secundus'').&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Radice, Betty |title=The Letters of the Younger Pliny|publisher=Penguin Classics |date=1975|page =13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There is some evidence that Pliny had a sibling. A memorial erected in Como (now {{CIL|5|5279}}) repeats the terms of a will by which the ''[[aedile]]'' Lucius Caecilius Cilo, son of Lucius, established a fund, the interest of which was to buy oil (used for soap) for the baths of the people of Como. The trustees are apparently named in the inscription: "L. Caecilius Valens and P. Caecilius Secundus, sons of Lucius, and the ''contubernalis'' Lutulla." The word ''contubernalis'' describing Lutulla is the military term meaning "tent-mate", which can only mean that she was living with Lucius, not as his wife. The first man mentioned, L. Caecilius Valens, is probably the older son. Pliny the Younger confirms&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Letters|chapter=I.8, To Saturninus|quote=I am compelled to discourse of my own largesse, as well as those of my ancestors.}}&lt;/ref&gt; that he was a trustee for the largess "of my ancestors". It seems unknown to Pliny the Elder, so Valens' mother was probably not his sister Plinia; perhaps Valens was Lutulla's son from an earlier relationship.{{Citation needed|date=January 2010}}

===Marriages===
Pliny the Younger married three times, firstly, when he was very young (about 18), to a stepdaughter of Veccius Proculus', who died at age 37; secondly, at an unknown date, to the daughter of [[Pompeia Celerina]]; and thirdly to Calpurnia, daughter of Calpurnius and granddaughter of [[Calpurnius Fabatus]] of [[Como|Comum]]. Letters survive in which Pliny recorded this last marriage taking place, his attachment to Calpurnia, and his sadness when she miscarried their child.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Pliny|title=Letters|pages=8.10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Death===

Pliny is thought to have died suddenly during his convention  in [[Bithynia et Pontus|Bithynia-Pontus]], around 113 AD, since no events referred to in his letters date later than that.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Hurley|first=Donna.W|title=Suetonius The Caesars|year=2011|publisher=Hackett Publishing Company|location=Indianapolis/Cambridge|isbn=978-1-60384-313-3|pages=x}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career==
Pliny was by birth of [[Equestrian (Roman)|equestrian]] rank, that is, a member of the aristocratic order of ''equites'' (knights), the lower (beneath the [[Roman Senate|senatorial order]]) of the two Roman aristocratic orders that monopolised senior civil and military offices during the early Empire. His career began at the age of 18 and initially followed a normal equestrian route. But, unlike most equestrians, he achieved entry into the upper order by being elected [[Quaestor]] in his late twenties.&lt;ref&gt;Cf. ''Pliny: A Self-Portrait in Letters'', The Folio Society, London (1978), Intro. pp.9–11&lt;/ref&gt; (See [[#Career summary|Career summary]] below.)

Pliny was active in the Roman legal system, especially in the sphere of the Roman [[centumviral court]], which dealt with inheritance cases. Later, he was a well-known prosecutor and defender at the trials of a series of provincial governors, including [[Baebius Massa]], governor of [[Baetica]]; [[Marius Priscus]], governor of [[Africa (Roman province)|Africa]]; [[Gaius Caecilius Classicus]], governor of [[Baetica]]; and most ironically in light of his later appointment to this province, [[Gaius Julius Bassus]] and [[Varenus Rufus]], both governors of [[Bithynia and Pontus]].&lt;ref&gt;Cf. ''Pliny: A Self-Portrait in Letters'', Intro. pp.10–16&lt;/ref&gt;

Pliny's career is commonly considered as a summary of the main Roman public charges and is the best-documented example from this period, offering proof for many aspects of imperial culture. Effectively, Pliny crossed all the principal fields of the organization of the early Roman Empire. It is an achievement for a man to have not only survived the reigns of several disparate emperors, especially the much-detested [[Domitian]], but also to have risen in rank throughout.&lt;ref&gt;Cf. ''op. cit.'', Intro. p.15-18&lt;/ref&gt;

==Writings==
Pliny penned his first work at age 14: a [[tragedy]] in [[Greek language|Greek]].&lt;ref&gt;"quin etiam quattuordecim natus annos Graecam tragoediam scripsi.": ''''Epistulae'' VII. iv&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, in the course of his life, he wrote numerous poems, most of which are lost. He was also known as a notable ''[[orator]]''; though he professed himself a follower of [[Cicero]]'s, Pliny's prose was more magniloquent and less direct than [[Cicero]]'s.

Pliny's only oration that now survives is the ''Panegyricus Traiani''. This was delivered in the [[Roman Senate|Senate]] in 100 and is a description of [[Trajan]]'s figure and actions in an adulatory and emphatic form, especially contrasting him with the Emperor [[Domitian]]. It is, however, a relevant document that reveals many details about the Emperor's actions in several fields of his administrative power such as taxes, justice, military discipline, and commerce. Recalling the speech in one of his letters, Pliny shrewdly defines his own motives thus:
{{quote|I hoped in the first place to encourage our Emperor in his virtues by a sincere tribute and, secondly, to show his successors what path to follow to win the same renown, not by offering instruction but by setting his example before them. To proffer advice on an Emperor's duties might be a noble enterprise, but it would be a heavy responsibility verging on insolence, whereas to praise an excellent ruler (''optimum principem'') and thereby shine a beacon on the path posterity should follow would be equally effective without appearing presumptuous.&lt;ref&gt;Epistulae III. xviii, here translated by Betty Radice, ''The Letters of the Younger Pliny'', Penguin Classics (1975), p. 104&lt;/ref&gt;}}

===''Epistulae''===
{{Main article|Epistulae (Pliny)}}
[[File:Johan Christian Claussen Dahl 001.jpg|thumb|250px|''Eruption of [[Vesuvius]]'', 1826 painting by [[I.C. Dahl]]]]
The largest surviving body of Pliny's work is his ''Epistulae'' (''Letters''), a series of personal missives directed to his friends and associates. These letters are a unique testimony of [[Roman Empire|Roman]] administrative history and everyday life in the 1st century AD. Especially noteworthy among the letters are two in which he describes the eruption of [[Mount Vesuvius]] in August 79, during which his uncle Pliny the Elder died (''Epistulae'' VI.16, VI.20), and one in which he asks the Emperor for instructions regarding official policy concerning Christians (''Epistulae'' X.96).

====Epistles concerning the eruption of Mount Vesuvius====
Pliny wrote the two letters describing the eruption of Mount Vesuvius approximately 25 years after the event, and both were sent in response to the request of his friend, the historian [[Tacitus]], who wanted to know more about Pliny the Elder's death. The two letters have great historical value due to their accurate description of Vesuvius' eruption; Pliny's attention to detail in the letters about Vesuvius is so keen that modern [[volcanologist]]s describe those types of eruptions as "[[Plinian eruption]]s".&lt;ref name=USGS&gt;{{cite web|url= http://volcanoes.usgs.gov/images/pglossary/PlinianEruption.php |title= VHP Photo Glossary: Plinian eruption |work= United States Geological Survey |accessdate=June 8, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Epistle concerning the Christian Religion====
{{Main article|Pliny the Younger on Christians}}
As the Roman governor of [[Bithynia et Pontus|Bithynia-Pontus]] (now in modern Turkey) Pliny wrote a [[Epistulae (Pliny)|letter]] to Emperor [[Trajan]] around 112 AD and asked for counsel on dealing with [[Early Christians|Christians]]. In the letter (''Epistulae'' X.96) Pliny detailed an account of how he conducted trials of suspected Christians who appeared before him as a result of anonymous accusations and asked for the Emperor's guidance on how they should be treated.&lt;ref name=Phil&gt;''The Early Christian Church'' Volume 1 by Philip Carrington (Aug 11, 2011) {{ISBN|0521166411}} Cambridge Univ Press page 429&lt;/ref&gt; Pliny had never performed a legal investigation of Christians and thus consulted Trajan in order to be on solid ground regarding his actions.  Pliny saved his letters and Trajan's replies&lt;ref name=Benko5&gt;'' Pagan Rome and the Early Christians'' by Stephen Benko (1 Jul 1986) {{ISBN|0253203856}} pages 5-7&lt;/ref&gt; and these are the earliest surviving Roman documents to refer to early Christians.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=St. Croix|first=G.E.M|title=Why Were the Early Christians Persecuted?|journal=Past &amp; Present|date=Nov 1963|volume=26|pages=6–38|jstor=649902|doi=10.1093/past/26.1.6}}&lt;/ref&gt; Trajan's response to Pliny makes it clear that being a Christian was sufficient for punishment, but Christians were not to be tracked down and anonymous denunciations were to be ignored.&lt;ref name=Heyman&gt;''The Power of Sacrifice: Roman and Christian Discourses in Conflict'' by George Heyman (Nov 2007) {{ISBN|0813214890}} pages xii-ix&lt;/ref&gt; The correspondence between Pliny and Emperor Trajan shows that the Roman Empire, as a government entity, did not at this time “seek out” Christians for prosecution or persecution.&lt;ref name="mesacc"&gt;{{cite web|title=Pliny the Younger on the Christ|url=http://www.mesacc.edu/~thoqh49081/handouts/pliny.html|accessdate=10 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Manuscripts===
In France [[Giovanni Giocondo]] discovered a manuscript of Pliny the Younger's letters containing his correspondence with Trajan. He published it in Paris dedicating the work to [[Louis XII]]. Two Italian editions of Pliny's Epistles were published by Giocondo, one printed in [[Bologna]] in 1498 and one from the press of [[Aldus Manutius]] in 1508.&lt;ref&gt;"Iohannem Iucundum architectum illum Veronensem, quem annos 1494–1506 in Gallia egisse novimus, codicem decem librorum Parisiis invenisse testis est Gulielmus Budaeus...Eodem ferme tempore Venetias ad Aldum Manutium editionem suam parantem, quae anno 1508 proditura erat, epistulas ex eodem vetustissimo codice descriptas misit ipse Iucundus." (R.A.B. Mynors, ''C. Plini Caecili Secundi Epistularum Libri Decem'', Oxford University Press (1976), Praefatio xviii–xix&lt;/ref&gt;

==Villas==
[[File:BellagiodiEst.JPG|thumb|255px|View of [[Bellagio (Italian region)|Bellagio]] in [[Lake Como]]. The institution on the hill is [[Villa Serbelloni]], believed to have been constructed on the site of Pliny's villa "Tragedy."]]
Pliny loved [[villa]]s. Being wealthy, he owned many, such as the one in Lake Como named "Tragedy" because of its location high on a hill.{{clarify| date= January 2018}} Another, on the shore of the lake, was named "Comedy" because it was sited low down.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |page=5 |title=The villas of Pliny from antiquity to posterity |first= Pierre |last=de la Ruffinière Du Prey |edition=illustrated |publisher=[[University of Chicago Press]] |year=1994 |isbn=978-0-226-17300-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; Pliny's main estate in Italy was in the north of [[Umbria]], under the passes of Bocca Trabaria and Bocca Serriola, where wood was harvested for Roman ships and sent to Rome via the [[Tiber]].{{Citation needed|date=March 2009}}

== History ==
{{Main article|History of the Portuguese language}}

When the Romans arrived at the [[Iberian Peninsula]] in 216&amp;nbsp;B.C., they brought the [[Latin language]] with them, from which all Romance languages descend. The language was spread by Roman soldiers, settlers, and merchants, who built [[Rome|Roman]] cities mostly near the settlements of previous [[Celts|Celtic]] or [[Celtiberians|Celtiberian]] civilizations established long before the Roman arrivals. For that reason, the language has kept a relevant substratum of much older, [[Atlantic Europe]]an [[Megalithic Culture]]&lt;ref&gt;Benozzo, F. (2018): "Uma paisagem atlântica pré-histórica. Etnogénese e etno-filologia paleo-mesolítica das tradições galega e portuguesa", in proceedings of Jornadas das Letras Galego-Portugesas 2015–2017. Università de Bologna, DTS and Academia Galega da Língua Portuguesa. pp. 159–170&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Celts|Celtic culture]]&lt;ref&gt;[https://milesio.wordpress.com/2016/03/23/a-galiza-e-o-norte-de-portugal-sao-a-origem-da-celticidade-europeia-f-benozzo/ Galicia and North Portugal are the origin of European celticity], interview with Prof. Francesco Benozzo, 13/03/2016&lt;/ref&gt;. 

Between 409 A.D. and 711 A.D., as the [[Roman Empire]] collapsed in [[Western Europe]], the Iberian Peninsula was conquered by [[Germanic peoples]] of the [[Migration Period]]. The occupiers, mainly [[Suebi]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://ling.cornell.edu/people/Weiss/CGL_34_Language_Contact_5.pdf Comparative Grammar of Latin 34] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927041334/http://ling.cornell.edu/people/Weiss/CGL_34_Language_Contact_5.pdf |date=27 September 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.arkeotavira.com/Mapas/Iberia/Populi.htm Ethnologic Map of Pre-Roman Iberia (circa 200 B.C.)]. Arkeotavira.com. Retrieved on 14 November 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;, [[Visigoths]] and [[Buri tribe|Buri]]&lt;ref&gt; Domingos Maria da Silva, Os Búrios, Terras de Bouro, Câmara Municipal de Terras de Bouro, 2006. (in Portuguese)&lt;/ref&gt; who originally spoke [[Germanic languages]], quickly adopted late Roman culture and the [[Vulgar Latin]] dialects of the peninsula and over the next 300 years totally integrated into the local populations. After the [[Moors|Moorish]] invasion beginning in 711, [[Arabic language|Arabic]] became the administrative and common language in the conquered regions, but most of the [[Mozarabs|remaining Christian population]] continued to speak a form of [[Romance languages|Romance]] commonly known as [[Mozarabic language|Mozarabic]], which lasted three centuries longer in [[Spain]].

Portuguese evolved from the medieval language, known today by linguists as [[Galician-Portuguese]], Old Portuguese or Old Galician, of the northwestern medieval [[Kingdom of Galicia]] and [[County of Portugal]]. It is in Latin administrative documents of the 9th century that written Galician-Portuguese words and phrases are first recorded. This phase is known as Proto-Portuguese, which lasted from the 9th century until the 12th-century independence of the [[County of Portugal]] from the Kingdom of León, which had by then assumed reign over Galicia.

In the first part of the [[Galician-Portuguese]] period (from the 12th to the 14th century), the language was increasingly used for documents and other written forms. For some time, it was the language of preference for [[lyric poetry]] in Christian [[Hispania]], much as [[Occitan]] was the language of the [[Occitan literature#Poetry of the troubadours|poetry of the troubadours]] in France. The Occitan digraphs ''lh'' and ''nh'', used in its classical orthography, were adopted by the [[Portuguese alphabet#Basic digraphs|orthography of Portuguese]], presumably by [[Gerald of Braga]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Lay |first=Stephen |date=2015 |title=Sanctity and Social Alienation in Twelfth-Century Braga as Portrayed in the Vita Sancti Geraldi |volume=31 |issue=2 |pages=153–168 |doi=10.5699/portstudies.31.2.0153 |journal=Portuguese Studies}}&lt;/ref&gt; a monk from [[Moissac]], who became bishop of [[Braga]] in Portugal in 1047, playing a major role in modernizing written Portuguese using classical [[Occitan language|Occitan]] norms.&lt;ref&gt;Jean-Pierre Juge (2001) ''Petit précis – Chronologie occitane – Histoire &amp; civilisation'', p. 25&lt;/ref&gt;. Portugal became an independent kingdom in 1139, under King [[Afonso I of Portugal]]. In 1290, King [[Denis of Portugal]] created the first Portuguese university in Lisbon (the ''Estudos Gerais'', which later moved to [[Coimbra]]) and decreed for Portuguese, then simply called the "common language", to be known as the Portuguese language and used officially.

In the second period of Old Portuguese, in the 15th and 16th centuries, with the [[Age of Discovery|Portuguese discoveries]], the language was taken to many regions of Africa, Asia, and the [[Americas]]. By the mid-16th century, Portuguese had become a ''[[lingua franca]]'' in Asia and Africa, used not only for colonial administration and trade but also for communication between local officials and Europeans of all nationalities.

Its spread was helped by mixed marriages between Portuguese and local people and by its association with [[Catholic Church|Roman Catholic]] [[missionary]] efforts, which led to the formation of [[creole language]]s such as that called [[Kristang language|Kristang]] in many parts of Asia (from the word ''cristão'', "Christian"). The language continued to be popular in parts of Asia until the 19th century. Some Portuguese-speaking Christian communities in [[India]], [[Sri Lanka]], [[Malaysia]], and [[Indonesia]] preserved their language even after they were isolated from Portugal.

The end of the Old Portuguese period was marked by the publication of the ''Cancioneiro Geral'' by [[Garcia de Resende]], in 1516. The early times of Modern Portuguese, which spans the period from the 16th century to the present day, were characterized by an increase in the number of learned words borrowed from [[Classical Latin]] and [[Ancient Greek|Classical Greek]] because of the [[Renaissance]] (learned words borrowed from Latin also came from [[Renaissance Latin]], the form of Latin during that time), which greatly enriched the lexicon. Most literate Portuguese speakers were also literate in Latin; and thus they easily adopted Latin words into their writing—and eventually speech—in Portuguese.{{citation needed|date=March 2017}}

Spanish author [[Miguel de Cervantes]] once called Portuguese "the sweet and gracious language", while the Brazilian poet [[Olavo Bilac]] described it as {{lang|pt|a última flor do Lácio, inculta e bela}} ("the last flower of [[Latium]], rustic and beautiful"). Portuguese is also termed "the language of Camões", after [[Luís de Camões|Luís Vaz de Camões]], one of the greatest literary figures in the Portuguese language and author of the Portuguese [[Epic poetry|epic poem]] ''[[Os Lusíadas]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Miguel de Cervantes: His Life &amp; Works|author=[[Henry Edward Watts]]|year=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Encyclopedia of Literature|first=Joseph T.|last=Shipley|publisher=Philosophical Library|year=1946|page=1188}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=A historical companion to postcolonial literatures: continental Europe and its empires|first1=Prem |last1=Poddar |first2=Rajeev S. |last2=Patke |first3=Lars |last3=Jensen |publisher=Edinburgh University Press|year=2008|chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Ghah5S3usnsC&amp;pg=PA431&amp;lpg=PA431&amp;dq=%22language+of+Cam%C3%B5es%22#v=onepage&amp;q=%22language%20of%20Cam%C3%B5es%22&amp;f=false|chapter=Introduction: The Myths and Realities of Portuguese (Post) Colonial Society|page=431|isbn=978-0-7486-2394-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;small&gt;Notes:
# Some [[linguistics|linguists]] argue that [[Galician language|Galician]], spoken in [[Galicia (Spain)|Galicia]], is merely a dialect of Portuguese rather than an independent language; this would make northwestern [[Spain]] a part of the Portuguese-speaking world.
# [[Macau]] is not a sovereign nation. It is one of the two semi-autonomous [[Special Administrative Region of the People's Republic of China|Special Administrative Regions of the People's Republic of China]] (the other being [[English language|Anglophone]] [[Hong Kong]], a former [[United Kingdom|British]] colony).
# [[Equatorial Guinea]] adopted Portuguese as one of its official languages in 2007, being admitted to CPLP in 2014. The use of the Portuguese language in this country is limited. However, a Portuguese-based creole language, [[Annobonese Creole]], is used, mainly on the islands of [[Annobon]] and [[Bioko]].&lt;/small&gt;

The combined population of the entire [[Lusophone]] area was estimated at 279 million in July 2017. This number does not include the Lusophone [[diaspora]], estimated at approximately 10 million people (including 4.5 million Portuguese, 3 million Brazilians, and half a million Cape Verdeans, among others), although it is hard to obtain official accurate numbers of diasporic Portuguese speakers because a significant portion of these citizens are naturalized citizens born outside of Lusophone territory or are children of immigrants, and may have only a basic command of the language. Additionally, a large part of the diaspora is a part of the already-counted population of the Portuguese-speaking countries and territories, such as the high number of Brazilian and [[Portuguese-speaking African countries|PALOP]] emigrant citizens in Portugal or the high number of Portuguese emigrant citizens in the PALOP and Brazil.

The Portuguese language therefore serves more than 250 million people daily, who have direct or indirect legal, juridical and social contact with it, varying from the only language used in any contact, to only education, contact with local or international administration, commerce and services or the simple sight of road signs, public information and advertising in Portuguese.

=== Future ===
According to estimates by [[UNESCO]], Portuguese is the fastest-growing [[European language]] after [[English language|English]] and the language has, according to the newspaper ''The Portugal News'' publishing data given from UNESCO, the highest potential for growth as an international language in [[southern Africa]] and [[South America]].&lt;ref name="The Portugal News"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.theportugalnews.com/cgi-bin/article.pl?id=906-9|title= Portuguese language gaining popularity | publisher= Anglopress Edicões e Publicidade Lda |date=5 May 2007 |accessdate=18 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Portuguese is a globalized language spoken officially on five continents, and as a second language by millions worldwide.

Since 1991, when Brazil signed into the economic community of [[Mercosul]] with other South American nations, namely Argentina, Uruguay and Paraguay, Portuguese is either mandatory, or taught, in the schools of those South American countries.

Although early in the 21st century, after Macau was ceded to China and Brazilian immigration to Japan slowed down, the use of Portuguese was in decline in Asia, it is once again becoming a language of opportunity there, mostly because of increased diplomatic and financial ties with economically powerful Portuguese-speaking countries (Brazil, Angola, Mozambique, etc.) in the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Leach |first=Michael |url=http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_hb6469/is_92/ai_n29406744/ |title=talking Portuguese; China and East Timor |accessdate=18 May 2011 |website=Arena Magazine |year=2007 |ref=harv |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111105033001/http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_hb6469/is_92/ai_n29406744/ |archivedate=5 November 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Sprachen_Osttimors-en.png|thumb|Ethnically diverse [[East Timor]] has Portuguese as one of its official languages]]

{{lang|pt|Você}}, a pronoun meaning "you", is used for educated, formal, and colloquial respectful speech in most Portuguese-speaking regions. In the Brazilian state of Rio Grande do Sul, {{lang|pt|você}} is virtually absent from the spoken language. In Portugal, it may be considered disrespectful to treat a stranger as {{lang|pt|você}}, so the pronoun is either replaced by the name of the person (or a title) or it is omitted, since the verbal conjugation allows the distinction between formal and informal treatment. Riograndense (or Gaúcho) Portuguese normally distinguishes formal from informal speech by verbal conjugation. Informal speech employs ''tu'' followed by third person verbs, formal language retains the traditional second person.

Conjugation of {{lang|pt|tu}} has three different forms in Brazil (verb "to see": {{lang|pt|tu viste?}}, in the traditional second person, {{lang|pt|tu viu?}}, in the third person, and {{lang|pt|tu visse?}}, in the innovative second person), the conjugation used in the Brazilian states of Pará, Santa Catarina and Maranhão being generally traditional second person, the kind that is used in other Portuguese-speaking countries and learned in Brazilian schools.

The predominance of Southeastern-based media products has established ''você'' as the pronoun of choice for the second person singular in both writing and multimedia communications. However, in the city of Rio de Janeiro, the country's main cultural centre, the usage of ''tu'' has been expanding ever since the end of the 20th century (see,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.celsul.org.br/Encontros/09/artigos/Viviane%20dos%20Santos.pdf |title=A Constituição de Corpora Orais Para a Análise das Formas de Tratamento |last=Viviane Maia dos Santos |publisher=Anais do IX Encontro do CELSUL Palhoça, SC, out. 2010 Universidade do Sul de Santa Catarina |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304034721/http://www.celsul.org.br/Encontros/09/artigos/Viviane%20dos%20Santos.pdf |archive-date=4 March 2016 |dead-url=yes |access-date=10 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; a linguistic research on the topic in Portuguese), being most frequent among youngsters and a number of studies have also shown an increase in its use in a number of other Brazilian dialects.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/signum/article/view/11776/11181 |title='Por onde tá "o tu"?' no português falado no Maranhão |last=Béliche Alves |first=Cibelle Corrêa |journal=Signum: Estudos da Linguagem |volume=15 |number=1 |pages=13–31 |year=2012 |accessdate=10 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Loremi Loregian-Penkal |url=http://www.gel.org.br/estudoslinguisticos/edicoesanteriores/4publica-estudos-2005/4publica-estudos-2005-pdfs/alternancia-tu-voce-411.pdf |title=Alternância tu/você em Santa Catarina: uma abordagem variacionista |publisher=Departamento de Letras – Universidade Estadual do Centro Oeste (UNICENTRO) |date=2005 |accessdate=10 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Modern Standard [[European Portuguese]] (''{{lang|pt|português padrão}}'' or ''{{lang|pt|português continental}}'') is based on the Portuguese spoken in the area including and surrounding the cities of [[Coimbra]] and [[Lisbon]], in central Portugal. Standard European Portuguese is also the preferred standard by the Portuguese-speaking African countries. As such, and despite the fact that its speakers are dispersed around the world, Portuguese has only two dialects used for learning: the European and the Brazilian. Some aspects and sounds found in many dialects of Brazil are exclusive to South America, and cannot be found in Europe. However, the Santomean [[Portuguese in Africa]] may be confused with a Brazilian dialect by its phonology and prosody.

Audio samples of some dialects and accents of Portuguese are available below.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://cvc.instituto-camoes.pt/hlp/geografia/mapa07.html|title=Audio samples of the dialects of Portuguese|accessdate=12 June 2015|publisher=[[Instituto Camões]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are some differences between the areas but these are the best approximations possible. IPA transcriptions refer to the names in local pronunciation.

The variant of Ceará includes fairly distinctive traits it shares with the one spoken in Piauí, though, such as distinctive regional phonology and vocabulary (for example, a debuccalization process stronger than that of Portuguese, a different system of the vowel harmony that spans Brazil from ''fluminense'' and ''mineiro'' to ''amazofonia'' but is especially prevalent in ''nordestino'', a very coherent coda sibilant palatalization as those of Portugal and Rio de Janeiro but allowed in fewer environments than in other accents of ''nordestino'', a greater presence of dental stop palatalization to palato-alveolar in comparison to other accents of ''nordestino'', among others, as well as a great number of archaic Portuguese words).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.protexto.ufc.br/genero_academico/artigo_cientifico/AAC12.doc |title=Archived copy |accessdate=19 April 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140405142847/http://www.protexto.ufc.br/genero_academico/artigo_cientifico/AAC12.doc |archivedate=5 April 2014 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Viviane Maia dos Santos |url=http://www.letras.ufrj.br/posverna/mestrado/SantosVM.pdf |title="Tu vai para onde? ...

# ''Baiano'' — Found in [[Bahia]], [[Sergipe]], northern Minas Gerais and border regions with [[Goiás]] and [[Tocantins]]. Similar to ''nordestino'', it has a very characteristic [[Stress timing|syllable-timed rhythm]] and the greatest tendency to pronounce unstressed vowels as open-mid {{IPAblink|ɛ}} and {{IPAblink|ɔ}}.[[File:Portugueselanguagedialects-Brazil.png|thumb|[[Variety (linguistics)|Variants]] and [[sociolect]]s of Brazilian Portuguese.]]
# [[File:Loudspeaker.svg|11px]] [http://cvc.instituto-camoes.pt/hlp/geografia/som90.html ''Fluminense''] — A broad dialect with many variants spoken in the states of [[Rio de Janeiro (state)|Rio de Janeiro]], [[Espírito Santo]] and neighbouring eastern regions of [[Minas Gerais]]. ''Fluminense'' formed in these previously ''caipira''-speaking areas due to the gradual influence of European migrants, causing many people to distance their speech from their original dialect and incorporate new terms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sibila.com.br/english/learn-about-portuguese-language-2/2721|title=Learn about Portuguese language|publisher=Sibila|accessdate=27 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Fluminense'' is sometimes referred to as ''carioca'', however ''carioca'' is a more specific term referring to the accent of the [[Greater Rio de Janeiro]] area by speakers with a ''fluminense'' dialect.
# ''Gaúcho'' — in [[Rio Grande do Sul]], similar to ''sulista''. There are many distinct accents in Rio Grande do Sul, mainly due to the heavy influx of European immigrants of diverse origins who have settled in colonies throughout the state, and to the proximity to [[Hispanosphere|Spanish-speaking nations]]. The ''gaúcho'' word in itself is a Spanish [[loanword]] into Portuguese of obscure [[Indigenous languages of the Americas|Indigenous Amerindian]] origins. [[File:Falantes no mundo.jpg|thumb|upright=0.9|Percentage of worldwide Portuguese speakers per country.]]
# ''[[Mineiro]]'' — [[Minas Gerais]] (not prevalent in the [[Triângulo Mineiro]]). As the ''fluminense'' area, its associated region was formerly a sparsely populated land where ''caipira'' was spoken, but [[Minas Gerais#History|the discovery of gold and gems made it the most prosperous Brazilian region]], what attracted Portuguese colonists, commoners from other parts of Brazil and their African slaves. South-southwestern, [[Zona da Mata (Minas Gerais)|southeastern]] and northern areas of the state have fairly distinctive speech, actually approximating to ''caipira'', ''fluminense'' (popularly called, often pejoratively, ''carioca do brejo'', "marsh carioca") and ''baiano'' respectively. Areas including and surrounding [[Belo Horizonte]] have a distinctive accent.
# [[File:Loudspeaker.svg|11px]] [http://cvc.instituto-camoes.pt/hlp/geografia/som91.html ''Nordestino'']&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"&gt;Note: the speaker of this sound file is from Rio de Janeiro, and he is talking about his experience with ''nordestino'' and ''nortista'' accents.&lt;/ref&gt; — more marked in the [[Sertão]] (7), where, in the 19th and 20th centuries and especially in the area including and surrounding the ''sertão'' (the dry land after [[Agreste]]) of Pernambuco and southern Ceará, it could sound less comprehensible to speakers of other Portuguese dialects than Galician or [[Rioplatense Spanish]], and nowadays less distinctive from other variants in the metropolitan cities [[Zona da Mata|along the coasts]]. It can be divided in two regional variants, one that includes the northern [[Maranhão]] and southern of [[Piauí]], and other that goes from [[Ceará]] to [[Alagoas]].
# ''Nortista'' or ''amazofonia''&amp;nbsp;— Most of [[Amazon Basin]] states i.e. [[North Region, Brazil|Northern Brazil]]. Before the 20th century, most people from the ''nordestino'' area fleeing the droughts and their associated poverty settled here, so it has some similarities with the Portuguese dialect there spoken. The speech in and around the cities of [[Belém]] and [[Manaus]] has a more European flavor in phonology, prosody and grammar.
# ''Paulistano'' — Variants spoken around [[Greater São Paulo]] in its maximum definition and more easterly areas of São Paulo state, as well perhaps "educated speech" from anywhere in [[São Paulo (state)|the state of São Paulo]] (where it coexists with ''caipira''). ''Caipira'' is the hinterland sociolect of much of the [[Centro-Sul|Central-Southern half]] of Brazil, nowadays conservative only in the rural areas and associated with them, that has a historically [[prestige (sociolinguistics)|low prestige]] in cities as Rio de Janeiro, Curitiba, Belo Horizonte, and until some years ago, in São Paulo itself. [[Sociolinguistics]], or what by times is described as '[[linguistic discrimination|linguistic prejudice]]', often correlated with [[Class discrimination|classism]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=por Caipira Zé Do Mér dia 17 de maio de 2011, 6 Comentários |url=http://www.imprenca.com/2011/05/mec-portugues-errado-e-linguistica.html |title=O MEC, o "português errado" e a linguistica... &amp;#124; ImprenÇa |publisher=Imprenca.com |date= 2011-05-17|accessdate=23 July 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120419090139/http://www.imprenca.com/2011/05/mec-portugues-errado-e-linguistica.html |archivedate=19 April 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.saindodamatrix.com.br/archives/2011/05/cartilha_do_mec.html |title=Cartilha Do Mec Ensina Erro De Português |publisher=Saindo da Matrix |date= |accessdate=23 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.jornaldebeltrao.com.br/noticia/63414/livro-do-mec-ensina-o-portugues-errado-ou-apenas-valoriza-as-formas-linguisticas |title=Livro do MEC ensina o português errado ou apenas valoriza as formas linguísticas?|work=Jornal de Beltrão |language= pt |date=26 May 2011 |accessdate=23 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; is a polemic topic in the entirety of the country since the times of [[Adoniran Barbosa#Musical production|Adoniran Barbosa]]. Also, the "Paulistano" accent was heavily influenced by the presence of immigrants in the city of São Paulo, especially the Italians.
# ''Sertanejo'' — [[Center-West Region, Brazil|Center-Western states]], and also much of [[Tocantins]] and [[Rondônia]]. It is closer to ''mineiro'', ''caipira'', ''nordestino'' or ''nortista'' depending on the location.
# ''Sulista'' — The variants spoken in the areas between the northern regions of [[Rio Grande do Sul]] and southern regions of São Paulo state, encompassing most of [[South Region, Brazil|southern Brazil]]. The city of [[Curitiba]] does have a fairly distinct accent as well, and a relative majority of speakers around and in [[Florianópolis]] also speak this variant (many speak ''florianopolitano'' or ''manezinho da ilha'' instead, related to the European Portuguese dialects spoken in [[Azores]] and [[Madeira]]). Speech of northern Paraná is closer to that of inland São Paulo.
# ''[[Florianopolitan dialect|Florianopolitano]]'' — Variants heavily influenced by European Portuguese spoken in [[Florianópolis]] city (due to a heavy immigration movement from Portugal, mainly its [[Autonomous regions of Portugal|insular regions]]) and much of its metropolitan area, [[Grande Florianópolis]], said to be a continuum between those whose speech most resemble ''sulista'' dialects and those whose speech most resemble ''fluminense'' and European ones, called, often pejoratively, ''manezinho da ilha''.
# ''[[Carioca]]'' — Not a dialect, but [[sociolect]]s of the ''fluminense'' variant spoken in an area roughly corresponding to [[Greater Rio de Janeiro]]. It appeared after locals came in contact with the Portuguese aristocracy amidst the [[Transfer of the Portuguese Court to Brazil|Portuguese royal family fled]] in the early 19th century. There is actually a continuum between Vernacular countryside accents and the ''carioca'' sociolect, and the educated speech (in Portuguese ''norma culta'', which most closely resembles other Brazilian Portuguese standards but with marked recent Portuguese influences, the nearest ones among the country's dialects along ''florianopolitano''), so that not all people native to the state of Rio de Janeiro speak the said sociolect, but most ''carioca'' speakers will use the standard variant not influenced by it that is rather uniform around Brazil depending on context (emphasis or formality, for example).
# ''Brasiliense'' — used in [[Brasília]] and its metropolitan area.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.meiamaratonadebrasilia.com.br/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=73&amp;Itemid=71 |archive-url=http://arquivo.pt/wayback/20160517200320/http://www.meiamaratonadebrasilia.com.br/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=73&amp;Itemid=71 |dead-url=yes |archive-date=17 May 2016 |title=Sotaque branco |publisher=Meia Maratona Internacional CAIXA de Brasília |accessdate=25 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is not considered a dialect, but more of a regional variant&amp;nbsp;– often deemed to be closer to ''fluminense'' than the dialect commonly spoken in most of Goiás, ''sertanejo''.
# ''Arco do desflorestamento'' or ''[[:pt:Dialeto da serra amazônica|serra amazônica]]''&amp;nbsp;— Known in its region as the "accent of the migrants", it has similarities with ''caipira'', ''sertanejo'' and often ''sulista'' that make it differing from ''amazofonia'' (in the opposite group of Brazilian dialects, in which it is placed along ''nordestino'', ''baiano'', ''mineiro'' and ''fluminense''). It is the most recent dialect, which appeared by the settlement of families from various other Brazilian regions attracted by the cheap land offer in recently [[Deforestation|deforested]] areas.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://amarnatureza.org.br/site/amazonia-2,9399/ |title=O Que É?

Differences between dialects are mostly of [[Accent (dialect)|accent]] and [[vocabulary]], but between the Brazilian dialects and other dialects, especially in their most colloquial forms, there can also be some grammatical differences. The [[Portuguese creole|Portuguese-based creoles]] spoken in various parts of Africa, Asia, and the Americas are independent languages.

=== Characterization and peculiarities ===
[[File:Portugués_europeo.png|thumb|left|200px|Map highlighting the different [[Accent (sociolinguistics)|accents]] within the Portuguese Republic]]
Portuguese, like [[Catalan language|Catalan]], preserved the stressed vowels of [[Vulgar Latin]], which became diphthongs in most other Romance languages; cf. Port., Cat., Sard. ''[[wikt:pedra|pedra]]'' ; Fr. ''{{wiktfr|pierre}}'', Sp. ''{{wiktes|piedra}}'', It. ''{{wiktit|pietra}}'', Ro. ''{{wiktro|piatră}}'', from Lat. ''{{wiktla|petra}}'' ("stone"); or Port. ''{{wiktpt|fogo}}'', Cat. ''{{wiktca|foc}}'', Sard. ''{{wiktsc|fogu}}''; Sp. ''{{wiktes|fuego}}'', It. ''{{wiktit|fuoco}}'', Fr. ''{{wiktfr|feu}}'', Ro. ''{{wiktro|foc}}'', from Lat. ''{{wiktla|focus}}'' ("fire"). Another characteristic of early Portuguese was the loss of [[:wiktionary:intervocalic|intervocalic]] ''l'' and ''n'', sometimes followed by the merger of the two surrounding vowels, or by the insertion of an [[epenthesis|epenthetic vowel]] between them: cf. Lat. ''{{wiktla|salire}}'' ("to jump"), ''{{wiktla|tenere}}'' ("to hold"), ''{{wiktla|catena}}'' ("chain"), Sp. ''{{wiktes|salir}}'', ''{{wiktes|tener}}'', ''{{wiktes|cadena}}'', Port. ''{{wiktpt|sair}}'', ''{{wiktpt|ter}}'', ''{{wiktpt|cadeia}}''. 

When the [[elision|elided]] consonant was ''n'', it often [[nasalization|nasalized]] the preceding vowel: cf. Lat. ''{{wiktla|manum}}'' ("hand"), ''{{wiktla|ranam}}'' ("frog"), ''{{wiktla|bonum}}'' ("good"), Port. ''{{wiktpt|mão}}'', ''{{wiktpt|rãa}}'', ''{{wiktpt|bõo}}'' (now ''{{wiktpt|mão}}'', ''{{wiktpt|rã}}'', ''{{wiktpt|bom}}''). This process was the source of most of the language's distinctive nasal diphthongs. In particular, the Latin endings ''{{wiktla|-anem}}'', ''{{wiktla|-anum}}'' and ''{{wiktla|-onem}}'' became ''{{wiktpt|-ão}}'' in most cases, cf. Lat. ''{{wiktla|canis}}'' ("dog"), ''{{wiktla|germanus}}'' ("brother"), ''{{wiktla|ratio}}'' ("reason") with Modern Port. ''{{wiktpt|cão}}'', ''{{wiktpt|irmão}}'', ''{{wiktpt|razão}}'', and their plurals ''-anes'', ''-anos'', ''-ones'' normally became ''-ães'', ''-ãos'', ''-ões'', cf. ''cães'', ''irmãos'', ''razões''. 

The Portuguese language is the only [[Romance language]] that has preserved the clitic case [[mesoclisis]]: cf. ''{{lang|pt|dar-te-ei}}'' (I'll give thee), ''{{lang|pt|amar-te-ei}}'' (I'll love you), ''{{lang|pt|contactá-los-ei}}'' (I'll contact them). Like [[Galician language|Galician]], it also retains the Latin synthetic [[pluperfect]] tense: ''{{lang|pt|eu estivera}}'' (I had been), ''{{lang|pt|eu vivera}}'' (I had lived), ''{{lang|pt|vós vivêreis}}'' (you had lived).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=GILmCwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA49&amp;lpg=PA49&amp;dq=latin+synthetic+pluperfect+also+in+portuguese%23#v=onepage&amp;q=latin%20synthetic%20pluperfect%20also%20in%20portuguese%23&amp;f=false|title=Tense and Aspect: From Semantics to Morphosyntax|isbn=9780195091939|last1=Giorgi|first1=Alessandra|last2=Pianesi|first2=Fabio|year=1997}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Romanian language|Romanian]] also has this tense, but uses the -s- form.

Most of the lexicon of Portuguese is derived, directly or through other Romance languages, from Latin. Nevertheless, because of its original [[Lusitanians|Lusitanian]] and Celtic [[Gallaeci]]an heritage, and the later participation of Portugal in the [[Age of Discovery]], it has some words from pre-Latin [[Paleohispanic languages]] and adopted [[loanword]]s from other languages around the world.

A number of Portuguese words can still be traced to the [[Pre-Roman peoples of the Iberian Peninsula|pre-Roman inhabitants of Portugal]], which included the [[Gallaeci]], [[Lusitanians]], [[Celtici]] and [[Cynetes]]. Most of these words derived from the [[Hispano-Celtic]] [[Gallaecian language]] of northwestern Iberia, and are very often shared with [[Galician language|Galician]] since both languages share a common origin in the medieval language of Galician-Portuguese. A few of these words existed in Latin as loanwords from other [[Celtic languages|Celtic]] sources, often [[Gaulish]]. Altogether these are over 1,000 words, some verbs and toponymic names of towns, rivers, utensils and plants.

In the 5th century, the Iberian Peninsula (the [[Ancient Rome|Roman]] [[Hispania]]) was conquered by the [[Germanic peoples|Germanic]] [[Suebi]] and [[Visigoths]]. As they adopted the Roman civilization and language, however, these people contributed with some 500 [[Germanic languages|Germanic]] words to the lexicon. Many of these words are related to warfare—such as ''espora'' "spur", ''estaca'' "stake", and ''guerra'' "war", from [[Gothic language|Gothic]] ''*spaúra'', ''*stakka'', and ''*wirro'', respectively. The [[Germanic languages]] influence also exists in [[toponymic surname]]s and [[patronymic surname]]s borne by Visigoth sovereigns and their descendants, and it dwells on placenames such has [[Ermesinde]], [[Esposende]] and [[Resende, Portugal|Resende]] where ''sinde'' and ''sende'' are derived from the Germanic "sinths" (military expedition) and in the case of Resende, the prefix ''re'' comes from Germanic "reths" (council). Other examples of Portuguese names, surnames and town names of Germanic [[toponymic]] origin include Henrique, [[Henriques (surname)|Henriques]], Vermoim, Mandim, Calquim, Baguim, Gemunde, Guetim, Sermonde and many more, are quite common mainly in the old [[Suebi]] and later [[Visigothic]] dominated regions, covering today's Northern half of Portugal and [[Galicia (Spain)|Galicia]].

Between the 9th and early 13th centuries, Portuguese acquired some 400 to 600 words from [[Arabic language|Arabic]] by influence of [[al-Andalus|Moorish Iberia]]. They are often recognizable by the initial [[Definite article in Arabic|Arabic article ''a(l)-'']], and include common words such as ''aldeia'' "village" from الضيعة ''alḍai`a'' (or from [[Edictum Rothari]]: ''[[aldii]]'', ''aldias''),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.documentacatholicaomnia.eu/03d/0643-0643,_Rothari,_Edictus,_LT.pdf|title=Rothari -Edictus|accessdate=12 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''alface'' "lettuce" from الخس ''alkhass'', ''armazém'' "warehouse" from المخزن ''almakhzan'', and ''azeite'' "olive oil" from الزيت ''azzait''.

Starting in the 15th century, the Portuguese maritime explorations led to the introduction of many loanwords from Asian languages. For instance, ''catana'' "cutlass" from [[Japanese language|Japanese]] ''katana'', ''chá'' "tea" from [[Chinese language|Chinese]] ''[[Tea#Etymology|''chá'']]'', and ''canja''&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | url=https://dicionario.priberam.org/Canja | title=Consulte o significado / definição de Canja no Dicionário Priberam da Língua Portuguesa, o dicionário online de português contemporâneo}}&lt;/ref&gt; "chicken-soup, piece of cake" from [[Malay language|Malay]].

From the 16th to the 19th centuries, because of the role of Portugal as intermediary in the [[Atlantic slave trade]], and the establishment of large Portuguese colonies in Angola, Mozambique, and Brazil, Portuguese acquired several words of African and [[indigenous peoples of Brazil|Amerind]] origin, especially names for most of the animals and plants found in those territories. While those terms are mostly used in the former colonies, many became current in European Portuguese as well. From [[Kimbundu language|Kimbundu]], for example, came ''kifumate'' &gt; ''cafuné'' "head caress" (Brazil), ''kusula'' &gt; ''caçula'' "youngest child" (Brazil), ''marimbondo'' "tropical wasp" (Brazil), and ''kubungula'' &gt; ''bungular'' "to dance like a wizard" (Angola). From South America came ''batata'' "[[potato]]", from [[Taíno language|Taino]]; ''ananás'' and ''abacaxi'', from [[Tupi–Guarani languages|Tupi–Guarani]] ''naná'' and [[Tupi language|Tupi]] ''ibá cati'', respectively (two species of [[pineapple]]), and ''pipoca'' "[[popcorn]]" from [[Tupi language|Tupi]] and ''tucano'' "[[toucan]]" from [[Guarani language|Guarani]] ''tucan''.

Finally, it has received a steady influx of loanwords from other European languages, especially French and [[English language|English]]. These are by far the most important languages when referring to loanwords. There are many examples such as: ''colchete''/''crochê'' "bracket"/"crochet", ''paletó'' "jacket", ''batom'' "lipstick", and ''filé''/''filete'' "steak"/"slice", ''rua'' "street" respectively, from French ''crochet'', ''paletot'', ''bâton'', ''filet'', ''rue''; and ''bife'' "steak", ''futebol'', ''revólver'', ''stock''/''estoque'', ''folclore'', from English ''beef'', ''football'', ''revolver'', ''stock'', ''folklore''.

Examples from other European languages: ''macarrão'' "pasta", ''piloto'' "pilot", ''carroça'' "carriage", and ''barraca'' "barrack", from Italian ''maccherone'', ''pilota'', ''carrozza'', and ''baracca''; ''melena'' "hair lock", ''fiambre'' "wet-cured ham" (in Portugal, in contrast with ''presunto'' "dry-cured ham" from Latin ''prae-exsuctus'' "dehydrated") or "canned ham" (in Brazil, in contrast with non-canned, wet-cured ''presunto cozido'' and dry-cured ''presunto cru''), and ''castelhano'' "Castilian", from Spanish ''melena'' "mane", ''fiambre'' and ''castellano''.

Before the last four decades, Brazilians adopted a greater number of loanwords from Japanese and other European languages (due to the [[Immigration to Brazil|historical immigration]] affecting their demographics), and they were and are also more willing to adopt foreign terms that come from [[globalization]] than the Portuguese, while the degree of African, Tupian and other Amerindian lexicon in Brazilian Portuguese is shown to be surprisingly lesser than that commonly expected of the said variant by the local Africanist and Indianist academia (that also has to some degree influenced the common sense of what gives a different cultural identity of Brazilians in relation to the Portuguese), so that its lexicon is almost identical (about 99%) to that of European Portuguese.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=DzYKdtWVYZ4C&amp;pg=PR7|title=Say It in Portuguese|page=vii|last=da Prista|first=Alexander|publisher=Courier Dover Publications|date=1979|accessdate=12 June 2015|isbn=9780486148069}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=dummies&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=EBK3o4GWqrgC&amp;pg=PA9|title=Portuguese for Dummies|page=9|last=Keller|first=Karen|date=2006|accessdate=12 June 2015|isbn=9780470049730}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=6UIuWj9fQfQC&amp;pg=PA113|title=Learner English|page=113|last1=Swan|first=Michael|last2=Smith|first2=Bernard|publisher=Cambridge University Press|date=2001|accessdate=12 June 2015|isbn=9780521779395}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Main article|Iberian Romance languages|Galician-Portuguese|Comparison of Spanish and Portuguese}}

Portuguese belongs to the [[West Iberian languages|West Iberian]] branch of the [[Romance language]]s, and it has special ties with the following members of this group:
* [[Galician language|Galician]], [[Fala language|Fala]] and [[Riverense Portuñol language|''portunhol do pampa'']] (the way ''riverense'' and its sibling dialects are referred to in Portuguese), its closest relatives.
* [[Mirandese language|Mirandese]], [[Leonese language|Leonese]], [[Asturian language|Asturian]], [[Extremaduran language|Extremaduran]] and [[Cantabrian dialect|Cantabrian]] ([[Astur-Leonese languages]]). Mirandese is the only recognised regional language spoken in Portugal (beside Portuguese, the only official language in Portugal).
* [[Spanish language|Spanish]] and [[Caló language|''calão'']] (the way ''caló'', language of the Iberian [[Romani people|Romani]], is referred to in Portuguese).

Portuguese and other Romance languages (namely French and Italian) are moderately mutually intelligible, and share considerable similarities in both vocabulary and grammar. Portuguese speakers will usually need some formal study before attaining strong comprehension in those Romance languages, and vice versa. However, Portuguese and Galician are [[mutually intelligible]], and Spanish is highly [[Mutual intelligibility#Asymmetric intelligibility|asymmetrically comprehensible]] to Portuguese speakers. Given that Portuguese has a larger phonemic inventory than Spanish, Portuguese is still considerably intelligible (if spoken slowly and without jargon) to most Spanish speakers, owing to their genealogical proximity and shared genealogical history as [[West Iberian languages|West Iberian]] ([[Ibero-Romance languages]]), historical contact between speakers and mutual influence, shared [[areal features]] as well as modern lexical, structural, and grammatical similarity (89%) between them.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last = Jensen

[[Portuñol|''Portunhol'']], a form of [[code-switching]], has a more lively use and is more readily mentioned in popular culture in South America. Said code-switching is not to be confused with the ''portunhol'' spoken on the borders of Brazil with Uruguay ({{lang|pt|dialeto do pampa}}) and Paraguay ({{lang|pt|dialeto dos [[Brasiguayos|brasiguaios]]}}), and of Portugal with Spain ({{lang|pt|[[barranquenho]]}}), that are Portuguese dialects spoken natively by thousands of people, which have been heavily influenced by Spanish.&lt;ref name="Lipski"&gt;{{cite journal | last =Lipski | first = John M | title=Too close for comfort? the genesis of 'portuñol/portunhol' | editor1-first = Timothy L | editor1-last = Face | editor2-first = Carol A | editor2-last = Klee | pages = 1–22 | year = 2006 | format= PDF | journal = Selected Proceedings of the 8th Hispanic Linguistics Symposium | url =http://www.lingref.com/cpp/hls/8/paper1251.pdf | accessdate=21 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Portuguese and Spanish are the only Ibero-Romance languages, and perhaps the only Romance languages with such thriving inter-language forms, in which visible and lively bilingual contact dialects and code-switching have formed, in which functional bilingual communication is achieved through attempting an approximation to the target foreign language (known as 'Portunhol') without a learned acquisition process, but nevertheless facilitates communication. There is an emerging literature focused on such phenomena (including informal attempts of standardization of the linguistic continua and their usage).&lt;ref name="Lipski"/&gt;

=== Galician-Portuguese in Spain ===
{{see also|Reintegrationism}}
The closest relative of Portuguese is Galician, which is spoken in the autonomous community (region) and [[historical nationality]] of [[Galicia (Spain)|Galicia]] (northwestern Spain). The two were at one time a single language, known today as [[Galician-Portuguese]], but they have diverged especially in pronunciation and vocabulary due to the political separation of Portugal from Galicia. There is, however, still a linguistic continuity consisting of the variant of Galician referred to as ''galego-português baixo-limiao'', which is spoken in several Galician villages between the municipalities of [[Entrimo]] and [[Lobios]] and the transborder region of the [[Peneda-Gerês National Park|natural park of Peneda-Gerês/Xurês]]. It is "considered a rarity, a living vestige of the medieval language that ranged from [[Cantabria]] to [[Mondego River|Mondego]] [...]".&lt;ref name="agal-gz.or"&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.agal-gz.org/pdf/falabaixalimia.pdf |title=A Fala Galego-Portuguesa da Baixa-Limia e Castro Laboreiro |access-date=2018-10-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;
As reported by UNESCO, due to the pressure of the Spanish language on the standard official version of the Galician language, the Galician language was on the verge of disappearing.&lt;ref name="agal-gz.or" /&gt; According to the Unesco philologist Tapani Salminen, the proximity to Portuguese protects Galician.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.galiciahoxe.com/mare/gh/galego-deixa-ser-unha-das-linguas-perigo-unesco/idNoticia-397878|title=O galego deixa de ser unha das linguas "en perigo" para a Unesco|author=Grupo El Correo Gallego|website=Galicia Hoxe – Noticias en galego a diario|accessdate=30 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Nevertheless, the core vocabulary and grammar of Galician are still noticeably closer to Portuguese than to those of Spanish. In particular, like Portuguese, it uses the future subjunctive, the personal infinitive, and the synthetic pluperfect. Mutual intelligibility (estimated at 90% by R. A. Hall, Jr., 1989)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ethnologue.com/show_language.asp?code=glg |title=Galician |publisher=Ethnologue |date= |accessdate=21 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; is excellent between Galicians and northern Portuguese. Many linguists consider [[Galician language|Galician]] to be a co-dialect of the Portuguese language.

Another member of the Galician-Portuguese group, most commonly thought of as a Galician dialect, is spoken in the [[Galician-Asturian|Eonavian]] region in a western strip in [[Asturias]] and the westernmost parts of the provinces of [[Province of León|León]] and [[Province of Zamora|Zamora]], along the frontier with Galicia, between the [[Eo (river)|Eo]] and [[Navia (river)|Navia]] rivers (or more exactly Eo and Frexulfe rivers). It is called ''eonaviego'' or ''gallego-asturiano'' by its speakers.

The Fala language, known by its speakers as ''xalimés'', ''mañegu'', ''a fala de Xálima'' and ''chapurráu'' and in Portuguese as ''a fala de Xálima'', ''a fala da Estremadura'', ''o galego da Estremadura'', ''valego'' ou ''galaico-estremenho'', is another descendant of Galician-Portuguese, spoken by a small number of people in the Spanish towns of [[Valverde del Fresno]] (''Valverdi du Fresnu''), [[Eljas]] (''As Ellas'') and [[San Martín de Trevejo]] (''Sa Martín de Trevellu'') in the autonomous community of [[Extremadura]], near the border with Portugal.

There are a number of other places in Spain in which the native language of the common people is a descendant of the Galician-Portuguese group, such as [[La Alamedilla]], [[Cedillo]] (''Cedilho''), [[Herrera de Alcántara]] (''Ferreira d'Alcântara'') and [[Olivenza]] (''Olivença''), but in these municipalities, what is spoken is actually Portuguese, not disputed as such in the mainstream.

It should be noticed that the diversity of dialects of the Portuguese language is known since the time of medieval Portuguese-Galician language when it coexisted with the Lusitanian-Mozarabic dialect, spoken in the south of Portugal. The dialectal diversity becomes more evident in the work of Fernão d'Oliveira, in the '''Grammatica da Lingoagem Portuguesa''', (1536), where he remarks that the people of Portuguese regions of Beira, Alentejo, Estremadura, and Entre Douro e Minho, all speak differently from each other. Also Contador d'Argote (1725) distinguishes three main varieties of dialects: the local dialects, the dialects of time, and of profession (work jargon). Of local dialects he highlights five main dialects: the dialect of Estremadura, of Entre-Douro e Minho, of Beira, of Algarve and of Trás-os-Montes. He also makes reference to the overseas dialects, the rustic dialects, the poetic dialect and that of prose.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://lusografias.wordpress.com/2008/08/27/jeronimo-cantador-de-argote-e-a-dialectologia-portuguesa-continuacao/|title=Jerónimo Cantador de Argote e a Dialectologia Portuguesa (continuação)|website=Lusografias|accessdate=30 May 2015|date=2008-08-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the kingdom of Portugal, ''Ladinho'' (or ''Lingoagem Ladinha'') was the name given to the pure Portuguese language romance, without any mixture of Aravia or Gerigonça Judenga.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=u4g_AQAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA140&amp;dq=aravia#v=onepage&amp;q=aravia&amp;f=false|title=Diccionario da lingua portugueza|publisher=|accessdate=30 May 2015|last1=Silva|first1=António de Morais|year=1823}}&lt;/ref&gt; While the term ''língua vulgar'' was used to name the language before D. Dinis decided to call it "Portuguese language",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://repositorio-aberto.up.pt/bitstream/10216/20003/2/jaosoriomathesis41993000083737.pdf|title=D.Dinis: o Rei a Língua e o Reino|accessdate=12 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; the erudite version used and known as Galician-Portuguese (the language of the Portuguese court) and all other Portuguese dialects were spoken at the same time. In a historical perspective the Portuguese language was never just one dialect. Just like today there is a standard Portuguese (actually two) among the several dialects of Portuguese, in the past there was Galician-Portuguese as the "standard", coexisting with other dialects.

=== Influence on other languages ===
{{See also|List of English words of Portuguese origin|Loan words in Malayalam#Portuguese|Loan words in Indonesian|Japanese words of Portuguese origin|List of Malay loanwords|Portuguese loanwords in Sinhala|Loan words in Sri Lankan Tamil#Portuguese|Sri Lanka Indo-Portuguese language}}

Portuguese has provided [[loanword]]s to many languages, such as [[Indonesian language|Indonesian]], [[Manado Malay]], [[Malayalam]], [[Sri Lanka Tamils (native)|Sri Lankan Tamil]] and [[Sinhalese language|Sinhalese]], [[Malay language|Malay]], [[Bengali language|Bengali]], [[English (language)|English]], [[Hindi]], [[Swahili language|Swahili]], [[Afrikaans]], [[Konkani language|Konkani]], [[Marathi language|Marathi]], [[Tetum language|Tetum]], [[Tsonga language|Xitsonga]], [[Japanese language|Japanese]], [[Lanc-Patuá creole|Lanc-Patuá]] (spoken in northern Brazil), [[Esan people#Language|Esan]] and [[Sranan Tongo]] (spoken in Suriname). It left a strong influence on the ''[[Old Tupi|língua brasílica]]'', a [[Tupi–Guarani language]], which was the most widely spoken in Brazil until the 18th century, and on the language spoken around [[Sikka Regency|Sikka]] in [[Flores]] Island, [[Indonesia]]. In nearby [[Larantuka]], Portuguese is used for prayers in [[Holy Week]] rituals.
The Japanese–Portuguese dictionary ''[[Nippo Jisho]]'' (1603) was the first dictionary of Japanese in a European language, a product of [[Society of Jesus|Jesuit]] missionary activity in Japan. Building on the work of earlier Portuguese missionaries, the ''[[Dictionarium Anamiticum, Lusitanum et Latinum]]'' (Annamite–Portuguese–Latin dictionary) of [[Alexandre de Rhodes]] (1651) introduced the modern [[Vietnamese alphabet|orthography of Vietnamese]], which is based on the orthography of 17th-century Portuguese. The [[Romanization]] of [[Chinese language|Chinese]] was also influenced by the Portuguese language (among others), particularly regarding [[List of common Chinese surnames|Chinese surnames]]; one example is ''Mei''. During 1583–88 [[Italians|Italian]] [[Jesuits]] [[Michele Ruggieri]] and [[Matteo Ricci]] created a Portuguese–Chinese dictionary—the first ever European–Chinese dictionary.&lt;ref name=camus&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.riccimac.org/doc/JesuitsJourneys.pdf|title=Jesuits' Journeys in Chinese Studies|last=Camus|first=Yves|accessdate=12 June 2015|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150924090942/http://www.riccimac.org/doc/JesuitsJourneys.pdf|archivedate=24 September 2015|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=ricciDict&gt;''Dicionário Português–Chinês : Pu Han ci dian: Portuguese–Chinese dictionary'', by Michele Ruggieri, Matteo Ricci; edited by John W.

For instance, as [[Portuguese Empire|Portuguese merchants]] were presumably the first to introduce the [[sweet orange]] in Europe, in several modern [[Indo-European languages]] the fruit has been named after them. Some examples are Albanian ''[[wikt:portokall#Albanian|portokall]]'', Bosnian (archaic) ''portokal'', ''prtokal'', Bulgarian [[wikt:портокал#Bulgarian|портокал]] (''portokal''), Greek [[wikt:πορτοκάλι#Greek|πορτοκάλι]] (''portokáli''), [[Macedonian language|Macedonian]] ''{{transl|mk|portokal}}'', Persian [[wikt:پرتقال#Persian|پرتقال]] (''porteghal''), and Romanian ''[[wikt:portocală#Romanian|portocală]]''.&lt;ref name="plantname"&gt;{{cite web |title=Multilingual Multiscript Plant Name Database: Sorting Citrus Names |url=http://www.plantnames.unimelb.edu.au/Sorting/Citrus_2.html|publisher=[[University of Melbourne]] &lt;http://www.search.unimelb.edu.au&gt; |accessdate=11 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="OstergrenBosse2011"&gt;{{cite book |author1=Ostergren, Robert C.  |author2=Le Bosse, Mathias  |lastauthoramp=yes |title=The Europeans, Second Edition: A Geography of People, Culture, and Environment |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=y-1fwix23zMC&amp;pg=PA129 |year= 2011 |publisher=[[Guilford Press]] |isbn=978-1-60918-140-6 |page=129}}&lt;/ref&gt; Related names can be found in other languages,&lt;!--"[[Amharic language|Amharic]] birtukan": NOT in sources--&gt; such as Arabic [[wikt:البرتقال#Arabic|البرتقال]] (''burtuqāl''), [[Georgian language|Georgian]] [[wikt:ფორთოხალი#Georgian|ფორთოხალი]] (''p'ort'oxali''), Turkish ''[[wikt:portakal#Turkish|portakal]]'' and [[Amharic]] ''birtukan''.&lt;ref name="plantname" /&gt; Also, in [[Regional Italian|southern Italian dialects]] (e.g. [[Neapolitan language|Neapolitan]]), an orange is ''[[:wikt:portogallo|portogallo]]'' or ''[[:wikt:it:purtuallo|purtuallo]]'', literally "(the) Portuguese (one)", in contrast to [[standard Italian]] ''arancia''.

=== Derived languages ===
{{Main article|Portuguese-based creole languages}}
[[File:2014 Lusophony Games map.svg|thumb|right|Participating countries of the [[Lusophony Games]]]]
Beginning in the 16th century, the extensive contacts between Portuguese travelers and settlers, African and Asian slaves, and local populations led to the appearance of many [[pidgin]]s with varying amounts of Portuguese influence. As each of these pidgins became the mother tongue of succeeding generations, they evolved into fully fledged [[creole language]]s, which remained in use in many parts of Asia, Africa and South America until the 18th century. Some Portuguese-based or Portuguese-influenced creoles are still spoken today, by over 3 million people worldwide, especially people of partial [[Portuguese people|Portuguese]] ancestry.

== Phonology ==
{{Main article|Portuguese phonology}}
{{IPA notice}}

[[File:2JOB Brasilândia.ogg|thumb|Spoken [[Brazilian Portuguese]]]]

Portuguese phonology is similar to those of languages such as [[French phonology|French]] (especially [[Quebec French phonology|that of Quebec]]), the [[Gallo-Italic languages]], [[Occitan phonology|Occitan]], [[Catalan phonology|Catalan]] and [[Franco-Provençal language|Franco-Provençal]], unlike [[Spanish phonology|that of Spanish]], which is similar to those of [[Sardinian language|Sardinian]] and the [[Neapolitan language|Southern Italian dialects]]. Some would describe the phonology of Portuguese as a blend of [[Spanish language|Spanish]], [[Gallo-Romance languages|Gallo-Romance]] (e.g. [[French language|French]]) and the [[Gallo-Italic languages|languages of northern Italy]] (especially [[Genoese dialect|Genoese]]), but with a deeper [[Celtic language|Celtic]] influence.&lt;ref&gt;''Handbook of the International Phonetic Association'' pp.&amp;nbsp;126–130&lt;/ref&gt;

There is a maximum of 9 oral vowels, 2 semivowels and 21 consonants; though some varieties of the language have fewer phonemes. There are also five [[nasal vowel]]s, which some linguists regard as allophones of the oral vowels.

=== Vowels ===
[[File:European Portuguese vowel chart.svg|thumb|right|upright=1.15|Chart of monophthongs of the Portuguese of Lisbon, with its {{IPA|/ɐ, ɐ̃/}} in central [[schwa]] position.]]

Like [[Catalan language|Catalan]] and [[German language|German]], Portuguese uses vowel quality to contrast stressed syllables with unstressed syllables. Unstressed isolated vowels tend to be [[vowel height|raised]] and sometimes centralized.

* Semivowels contrast with unstressed high vowels in verbal conjugation, as in ''(eu) rio'' {{IPA|/ˈʁi.u/}} and ''(ele) riu'' {{IPA|/ˈʁiw/}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Rodrigues|2012|pp=39–40}}&lt;/ref&gt; Phonologists discuss whether their nature is vowel or consonant.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Bisol|2005|p=123}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* In most of Brazil and Angola, the consonant hereafter denoted as {{IPA|/ɲ/}} is realized as a [[nasal palatal approximant]] {{IPAblink|ȷ̃|j̃}}, which [[nasalization|nasalizes]] the vowel that precedes it: {{IPA|[ˈnĩj̃u]}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Thomas|1974|p=8}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation

}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* {{Harvcoltxt|Bisol|2005|p=122}} proposes that Portuguese possesses labio-velar stops {{IPA|/kʷ/}} and {{IPA|/ɡʷ/}} as additional phonemes rather than sequences of a velar stop and {{IPA|/w/}}.&lt;ref name="labialized velar - Bisol" /&gt;
* The consonant hereafter denoted as {{IPA|/ʁ/}} has a variety of realizations depending on dialect. In Europe, it is typically a [[uvular trill]] {{IPA|[ʀ]}}; however, a pronunciation as a [[voiced uvular fricative]] {{IPA|[ʁ]}} may be becoming dominant in urban areas. There is also a realization as a [[voiceless uvular fricative]] {{IPA|[χ]}}, and the original pronunciation as an [[alveolar trill]] {{IPA|[r]}} also remains very common in various dialects.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Mateus|d'Andrade|2000|pp=5–6, 11}}&lt;/ref&gt; A common realization of the word-initial {{IPA|/r/}} in the Lisbon accent is a voiced uvular trill fricative {{IPAblink|ʀ̝}}.&lt;ref name="gr157"&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Grønnum|2005|p=157}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Brazil, {{IPA|/ʁ/}} can be [[velar consonant|velar]], [[uvular consonant|uvular]], or [[glottal consonant|glottal]] and may be voiceless unless between voiced sounds.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Barbosa|Albano|2004|p=228}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is usually pronounced as a [[voiceless velar fricative]] {{IPA|[x]}}, a [[voiceless glottal fricative]] {{IPA|[h]}} or [[voiceless uvular fricative]] {{IPA|[χ]}}. See also ''[[Guttural R#Portuguese|Guttural R in Portuguese]]''.
* {{IPA|/s/}} and {{IPA|/z/}} are normally {{lcons|lamino-alveolar}}, as in English. However, a number of dialects in northern Portugal pronounce {{IPA|/s/}} and {{IPA|/z/}} as [[apico-alveolar]] [[sibilant]]s (sounding somewhat like a soft {{IPA|[ʃ]}} or {{IPA|[ʒ]}}), as in the Romance languages of northern Iberia. A very few northeastern Portugal dialects still maintain the medieval distinction between apical and laminal sibilants (written ''s/ss'' and ''c/ç/z'', respectively).
* As a phoneme, {{IPA|/tʃ/}} occurs only in loanwords, with a tendency for speakers to substitute in {{IPA|/ʃ/}}. However, {{IPA|[tʃ]}} is an [[allophone]] of {{IPA|/t/}} before {{IPA|/i/}} in a number of Brazilian dialects. Similarly, {{IPA|[dʒ]}} is an allophone of {{IPA|/d/}} in the same contexts.
* In northern and central Portugal, the voiced stops ({{IPA|/b/}}, {{IPA|/d/}}, and {{IPA|/ɡ/}}) are usually lenited to [[fricative]]s {{IPA|[β]}}, {{IPA|[ð]}}, and {{IPA|[ɣ]}}, respectively, except at the beginning of words or after nasal vowels.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Cruz-Ferreira|1995|p=92}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Mateus|d'Andrade|2000|p=11}}&lt;/ref&gt; A [[Spanish phonology#Phonetic notes|similar process]] occurs in Spanish.

== Grammar ==
{{Main article|Portuguese grammar}}

A notable aspect of the grammar of Portuguese is the verb. Morphologically, more verbal inflections from classical Latin have been preserved by Portuguese than by any other major [[Romance language]]. Portuguese and Spanish share very similar grammar. Portuguese also has some grammatical innovations not found in other Romance languages (except Galician and Fala):
* The [[present perfect]] has an iterative sense unique to the Galician-Portuguese language group. It denotes an action or a series of actions that began in the past but expected to occur again in the future. For instance, the sentence ''Tenho tentado falar com ela'' would be translated to "I have been trying to talk to her", not "I have tried to talk to her." On the other hand, the correct translation of "Have you heard the latest news?" is not ''*Tem ouvido a última notícia?'' but ''Ouviu a última notícia?'' since no repetition is implied.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |title=Verbal Periphrases in Romance: Aspect, Actionality, and Grammaticalization |last=Squartini |first=Mario |publisher=Mouton de Gruyter |year=1998 |isbn=978-3-11-016160-1 |location=Berlin |oclc=39007172}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Vernacular]] Portuguese makes use of the future [[subjunctive mood]], which developed from medieval [[West Iberian languages|West Iberian Romance]]. In modern Spanish and Galician, it has almost entirely fallen into disuse. The future subjunctive appears in dependent clauses that denote a condition that must be fulfilled in the future so that the independent clause will occur. English normally employs the present tense under the same circumstances:

:''Se eu ''for'' eleito presidente, mudarei a lei.''
:If ''I am'' elected president, I will change the law.

:''Quando ''fores'' mais velho, vais entender.''
:When ''you grow'' older, you will understand.
* The personal [[infinitive]] can [[inflection|inflect]] according to its subject in [[Grammatical person|person]] and [[Grammatical number|number]]. often shows who is expected to perform a certain action. ''É melhor voltares'' "It is better [for you] to go back," ''É melhor voltarmos'' "It is better [for us] to go back." Perhaps for that reason, infinitive clauses replace subjunctive clauses more often in Portuguese than in other Romance languages.

{{Main article|Portuguese orthography}}
Portuguese is written with 26 letters of the [[Latin script]], making use of five [[diacritic]]s to denote stress, vowel height, contraction, nasalization, and etymological [[assibilation]] ([[acute accent]], [[circumflex]], [[grave accent]], [[tilde]], and [[cedilla]]). The [[Diaeresis (diacritic)|trema]] was also formerly used in Brazilian Portuguese, and can still be encountered in words derived from proper names in other languages, such as Anhangüera and mülleriano.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.brazil-help.com/recent_changes.htm|title=Most Recent Changes to the Portuguese Language}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.moderna.com.br/acordo/guia_acordo.pdf|deadurl=yes|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100601092927/http://www.moderna.com.br/acordo/guia_acordo.pdf|archive-date=1 June 2010|title=Guia do Acordo Ortográfico|publisher=Moderna|language=pt}}&lt;/ref&gt; Accented characters and [[digraph (orthography)|digraphs]] are not counted as separate letters for [[collation]] purposes.

A '''presidential proclamation''' is a statement issued by a [[President of the United States|President]] on an issue of [[public policy]], and is a kind of [[presidential directive]]. A presidential proclamation is an instrument that,
* states a condition,
* declares a law and requires obedience,
* recognizes an event, or
* triggers the implementation of a law, by recognizing that the circumstances described in the law have been realized.&lt;ref name="cooper1"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Cooper|first1=Philip J.|title=By order of the president: the use and abuse of executive direct action|date=2002|publisher=University Press of Kansas|isbn=0700611800|page=116|edition=1|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=RjQQAQAAMAAJ}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Proclamations issued by the U.S. President fall into two broad categories:
# "ceremonial" proclamations, that designate special observances or celebrate national holidays, and
# "substantive" proclamations, that usually relates to the conduct of foreign affairs and other sworn executive duties. These may be, but are not limited to, matters of international trade, the execution of set export controls, the establishment of tariffs, or the reservation of federal lands for the benefit of the public in some manner.&lt;ref name="OFR101"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.federalregister.gov/uploads/2011/01/fr_101.pdf|title=Federal Register 101: Presidential Documents|work=Office of the Federal Register|date=2010-04-08|format=PDF|accessdate=2017-09-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Unless authorized by [[United States Congress|Congress]], a [[President of the United States|President]]'s proclamation does not have the force of law. If Congress were to pass an [[Act of Congress|act]] that would take effect upon the happening of a contingent event, and subsequently the President proclaimed that the event happened, then the proclamation would have the force of law.&lt;ref name="cooper2"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Cooper|first1=Phillip J.|title=By Order of the President: Administration by Executive Order and Proclamation|journal=Administration &amp; Society|date=1 August 1986|volume=18|issue=2|pages=233–262|url=http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/009539978601800205|accessdate=21 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Presidential proclamations are often dismissed as a practical tool for policy making because they are considered to be largely ceremonial or symbolic in nature.&lt;ref name="cooper2"/&gt; The administrative weight of these proclamations is upheld because they are often specifically authorized by congressional statute, making them "delegated unilateral powers". Their issuances have on occasion led to important political and historical consequences in the development of the United States. [[George Washington]]'s [[Proclamation of Neutrality]] in 1793 and Lincoln's [[Emancipation Proclamation]] in 1863 are some of America's most famous presidential proclamations in this regard.&lt;ref name="UofHproject"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.polsci.uh.edu/database/aboutproc.asp|title=Presidential Proclamations Project|work=University of Houston, Department of Political Science|accessdate=2010-11-12|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100625230638/http://www.polsci.uh.edu/database/aboutproc.asp|archivedate=2010-06-25|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The legal weight of presidential proclamations suggests their importance to presidential governance.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.polsci.uh.edu/database/aboutproc.asp Presidential Proclamations Project] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100625230638/http://www.polsci.uh.edu/database/aboutproc.asp |date=2010-06-25 }}, University of Houston, Political Science Dept., Retrieved 2009-12-07&lt;/ref&gt;

Other more recent policy-based proclamations have also made a substantial impact on economic and [[domestic policy]], including [[Bill Clinton]]'s declaration of [[federal lands]] for [[National Monument (United States)|national monument]]s and [[George W. Bush]]'s declaration of the areas affected by [[Hurricane Katrina]] as disaster areas.

Proclamations are also used, often contentiously, to grant presidential [[pardon]]s. Recent notable pardon proclamations are [[Gerald Ford]]'s pardon of former President [[Richard Nixon]] (1974),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Ford |first=Gerald |date=1974-09-08 |url=http://narademo.umiacs.umd.edu/cgi-bin/isadg/viewitem.pl?item=100775 |title=Presidential Proclamation 4311 by President Gerald R.

Bush]]'s clemency of [[Scooter Libby|Lewis "Scooter" Libby's]] prison sentence (2007).&lt;ref name="Proc8159"&gt;[[s:Proclamation 8159|Proclamation 8159]] - ''Grant of Executive Clemency'', 2007-07-02, ''Office of the Federal Register'', Vol.&amp;nbsp;72, No.&amp;nbsp;129,&amp;nbsp;{{USFedReg|72|37095}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although less significant in terms of [[public policy]], proclamations are also used ceremonially by presidents to honor a group or situation or to call attention to certain issues or events. For instance, President [[George H. W. Bush]] issued a proclamation to honor veterans of [[World War II]] and [[Ronald Reagan]] called attention to the health of the nation's eyes by proclaiming a "Save Your Vision Week" and Proclamation 5497 recognizing "National Theatre Week".

'''Saeed Hajjarian''' ({{lang-fa|سعید حجاریان}}, born 1954) is an [[Iranian peoples|Iranian]] [[Iranian reform movement|reformist]] [[political strategist]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news| title=Guns and the bookworm|accessdate=6 July 2014| date=Mar 16, 2000 |url= http://www.economist.com/node/331143|work=Economist}}&lt;/ref&gt; journalist,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news| title=Jailed Iranian reformist's life at risk: U.S. group|accessdate=6 July 2009| date=1 July 2009|url= https://www.reuters.com/article/gc08/idUSTRE5602U520090701|work=Reuters}}&lt;/ref&gt; pro-democracy activist and former [[intelligence officer]]. He was a member of [[Tehran]]'s  [[City and Village Councils of Iran|city council]], and advisor to president [[Mohammad Khatami]]. On 12 March 2000, he was shot in the face by an assailant and severely disabled, an act many Iranians  believe was in retaliation for his help in uncovering the [[chain murders of Iran]] and his significant help to the [[Iranian reform movement]] in general, according to the BBC.&lt;ref name="news.bbc.co.uk"&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/middle_east/675254.stm Analysis: Who wanted Hajjarian dead? ] BBC&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life and education==
Hajjarian was born in [[Javadiyeh]] neighborhood of [[Tehran, Iran]] in 1954 to parents from [[Kashan]]. He studied [[mechanical engineering]] at [[Tehran University]]. In 1977 Hajjarian was enrolled for [[military service]] in [[Persian Gendarmerie|Gendarmerie]]. A young Iranian revolutionary during the 1979 [[Iranian Revolution]], he entered the [[Islamic Revolution Committees]] before becoming an Intelligence officer in Navy. Hajjarian contneud his education and obtained a Ph.D. in [[political science]] from [[Tehran University]]. His thesis advisor was [[Hossein Bashiriyeh]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=گفتگو با سعید حجاریان|url=http://www.afkarnews.ir/vdcdx50fnyt0so6.2a2y.html|work=afkarnews.ir|accessdate=6 July 2014|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140904022222/http://www.afkarnews.ir/vdcdx50fnyt0so6.2a2y.html|archivedate=4 September 2014|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was one of the students who [[Iran hostage crisis|took over the US embassy in Tehran]] in 1979.&lt;ref name="news.bbc.co.uk"/&gt;

==Career==
After the revolution, Hajjarian was involved in the formation of the intelligence apparatus of the newly founded [[Islamic Republic]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2009/jul/21/iran-saeed-hajarian-imprisonment|title=Iran's illogical cruelty|author=Robert Tait|work=the Guardian}}&lt;/ref&gt; Through the 1980s, he worked in the [[Ministry of Intelligence of Iran|ministry of intelligence]], where his positions included vice minister for political affairs. In the late 1980s, he left the ministry, and established [[Center for Strategic Research]] under the [[President of Iran|presidency]]. That was where he played an important role in creating a new discourse based on democracy and rule of law for his generation of revolutionaries.

When [[Mohammad Khatami]] was elected President in 1997, he appointed Hajjarian his political advisor. In 1999, he was elected to the [[City and Village Councils of Iran|city council]] of Tehran in the first city elections after the 1979 revolution. Hajjarian was also the editor of ''[[Sobh-e Emrooz]]'' newspaper, which was a strong advocate of Khatami's reforms. He was believed to be the source of information for many articles written by the investigative journalists, [[Akbar Ganji]] and [[Emadeddin Baghi]]. These included stories about the "[[Chain murders of Iran|Chain murders]]" of dissident intellectuals by members of Iran's intelligence ministry.{{Citation needed|date=October 2012}}

Hajjarian was one of the personal key factors of president Khatami. He was a member of the reformist elite and has leadership support role in reform movement. He joined the ministry of intelligence and national security (MINS) in 1984 and he leaves it in 1989. He worked also in the center of strategic studies. Working in such a place, he was able to invite some of the officials of MINS to join the reform movement. All of them try to develop the reform movement. Peoples like Akbar ganji, Mohsen Armin, Abbas abdi, Hamid Reza Jalaeipour, Muhammad Mousavi Khouiniha, Ebrahim Asghar zadeh and Mohsen Sazgaran are among those personals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Anoushiravan Enteshami &amp; Mahjoob Zweiri|title=Iran and the rise of Neoconsevatives,the politics of Tehran's silent Revolution|year=2007|page=9|publisher=I.B.Tauris}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In March, 2000 he was shot in the face by a gunman on the doorstep of [[Tehran]]'s city council.&lt;ref name=ed1mar&gt;{{cite news|last=Blanche|first=Ed|title='Rogue agent' convictions leave many questions unanswered|url=http://www.thefreelibrary.com/%60ROGUE+AGENT'+CONVICTIONS+LEAVE+MANY+QUESTIONS+UNANSWERED.-a071705532|accessdate=21 June 2013|newspaper=The Middle East|date=1 March 2001}}&lt;/ref&gt; The would-be assassin fled on a motorcycle with an accomplice. The bullet entered through his left cheek and lodged in his neck, and put Hajjarian into a coma. During this time, groups of young Iranians kept vigil outside Sina hospital, where he was being treated. Hajjarian was badly paralyzed for life.{{Citation needed|date=October 2012}}

His assailant, [[Saeed Asgar]], a young man who was reported to be a member of the [[Basij]] militia, was later arrested and sentenced to spend 15 years in jail.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Sachs|first=Susan|title=2 Trials Focus Attention on Iranian Justice|work=The New York Times| accessdate=6 July 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Five Jailed Over Iran Shooting|work=The Independent|accessdate=6 July 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; But he was released after spending only a short term in prison. Asgar was accompanied by Mohsen Morteza Majidi on a motorbike. Others, who were involved, include Mohammad Ali Moghaddami, Mehdi Rowghani, Mousa Jan Nesari, Ali Pourchaluei (possibly the one who shot Hajjarian), Saeed Golounani and  Safar Maghsoudi.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Agency publishes names of suspects involved in Hajjarian case| work=BBC Monitoring Middle East|accessdate=6 July 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Possible cause===
His attempted assassination is thought to be associated with the exposure of the "[[Chain murders of Iran|Chain murders]]"  in his ''Sobh Emrouz'' daily newspaper, and the "key role" he is believed to have played "in bringing about ... damaging disclosures," both as the editor of the exposing newspaper and one of the few reformists likely to be a source of information about activity in the intelligence ministry. Consequently, "some believe that remnants" of the chain murder "intelligence killer group may have been" behind his attempted assassination.&lt;ref name="news.bbc.co.uk"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Secor"&gt;[http://www.newyorker.com/talk/comment/2009/06/29/090629taco_talk_secor ''The New Yorker'', "Protest Vote," 29 June 2009, p.23] Retrieved 11 July 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

===Recovery===
Hajjarian slowly recovered somewhat from the shooting. By 2005, Hajjarian was still unable to speak with a clear voice and still using the wheelchair, although could walk with help.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Secor |first=Laura |url=http://www.newyorker.com/fact/content/articles/051121fa_fact4 |title=New Yorker magazine, "Fugitives, Young Iranians confront the collapse of the reform movement", Laura Secor, 21 November 2005 |publisher=Newyorker.com |date=2005-11-21 |accessdate=2013-11-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; As of 2009 he still spoke with difficulty and was "dependent on the constant care of doctors and family."&lt;ref name="Secor"/&gt;

== Research works and viewpoints ==
Hajjarian has used the term “''dual sovereignty''” as an analytic tool to describe the balance of power in the [[Politics of Iran|Islamic Republic's government system]], in which there is a supposed split between the [[Supreme Leader of Iran|Supreme Leader]] and popularly elected officials, e.g. the [[President of Iran|President]]. The idea has been publicly denounced by [[Ali Khamenei]] in 2004, being called "damaging and a deadly poison" repeated by "irrational people".&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|editor-first1=Gideon|editor-last1=Rose|title=Iran and the Bomb 2: A New Hope|publisher=Foreign Affairs|year=2014|pages=14–15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He believes that a frontal assault on the fortresses of power is impractical. Hajjarian argued that domination of politics by clerics was wrong, but could be gradually eroded by "mobilizing the masses and using them as bargaining chips with Iran's rulers."&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|first1=Abbas|last1=Milani|title=The New Democrats: An Intellectual History of the Green Wave|url=https://newrepublic.com/article/62272/the-new-democrats|publisher=The New Republic|date=15 July 2009|pages=14–15}}&lt;/ref&gt; His strategy for the reform movement was described as extending the reformists "reach by triangulating between the mass movement they represented and the autocratic state with which they shared power. He coined the phrase that would define the reformists’ strategy: “''Pressure from below, negotiation at the top''.”&lt;ref name="Secor"/&gt; The strategy remarks that by developing [[civil society]] and winning the battle of [[public opinion]], the reform movement can gain enough strength to not only resist the hardliners, but also push for deep changes within the system via bargains with top officials unwilling to reform.&lt;ref name="Tehran Bureau"&gt;{{Citation|first1=Muhammad|last1=Sahimi|title=Reformist Strategist: Saeed Hajjarian|url=https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/pages/frontline/tehranbureau/2009/07/reformist-strategist-saeed-hajjarian.html|publisher=Tehran Bureau|date=8 July 2009|access-date=15 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hajjarian formulated the proposed gradual move to a favorable democratic system as “''fortress to fortress triumph''”, meaning that reformers should concentrate on weakening and capturing key institutions, i.e. fortresses of power, one by one.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|first1=David Martin|last1=Jones|first2=Ann|last2=Lane|first3=Paul|last3=Schulte|title=Terrorism, Security and the Power of Informal Networks|publisher=Edward Elgar Publishing|year=2010|pages=107}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hajjarian argued that there is a way of combating the predominance of [[Hokumat-e Islami : Velayat-e faqih (book by Khomeini)|Valiyat al-faqih]] (rule of the Islamic jurist) by underlining the de facto secularization of religion by the supreme leader of the Islamic Republic, Khomeini. He allegedly showed the supremacy of politics as such over any religious norm when he said that the interests of the Islamic Republic are paramount in Islam and that [[zakat]], [[salat]], [[hajj]], and everything else in Islam, are subordinant. This kind of decision, he states, means that politics are more important than religion and that this acknowledges the secularization of religion. In this context, he argues, it is possible to reassess velayat faqih and to reject its supremacy within the political field in Iran.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal| first1 = F.| title = The New Intellectuals in Iran| journal = Social Compass| volume = 51| issue = 2| last1 = Khosrokhavar| pages = 191| year = 2004| doi = 10.1177/0037768604043006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After reformists lost their "fortresses", Hajjarian said in 2004 that the reforms program have been failed and now there are multiple choices for the Iranian people. One option is giving up and accepting the current situation. Another choice is [[apathy]], followed by adopting [[defeatism]]—waiting for a possible [[Support for military action against Iran|foreign military action against Iran]] and regime change— or to let the developing [[lumpenproletariat]] in the society grow until they ignite a [[revolution]] in Iran. Hajjarian prefers what he calls the best alternative, which is to assume “''reforms is dead, long live the reforms''” and continue the reforms path patiently.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|first1=Farhang|last1=Rajaee|title=Islamism and Modernism: The Changing Discourse in Iran|publisher=University of Texas Press|year=2010|pages=196–197}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==2009 elections==
On 16 June 2009, four days after the disputed [[Iranian presidential election, 2009|presidential election]], it was reported that Hajjarian had been arrested.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/latestCrisis/idUSDAH619963|title=Leading Iranian reformist arrested, his office says|work=Reuters|date=16 June 2009|accessdate=16 June 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was reported that he died in Evin prison under torture on 7 July.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.peiknet.com/|title=شهادت سعید حجاریان زیر دست مرتضوی و شریعتمداری |work=Peiknet.com|date=7 July 2009| accessdate=9 July 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, it was later added that he was still alive but had suffered a nervous breakdown on 8 July and was in critical condition in a military hospital in Tehran.&lt;ref name="TB978"&gt;{{cite news|author=Muhammad Sahimi|date=8 July 2009|title=Reformist Strategist: Saeed Hajjarian|work=Teheran Bureau|url=http://tehranbureau.com/saeed-hajjarian/|accessdate=10 July 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Later, there were reports that he was still in Evin Prison, possibly in a clinic there,&lt;ref name="Guardian20090721"&gt;{{cite news |author=Robert Tait|date=21 July 2009|title=Iran's illogical cruelty: The imprisonment of the frail reformer Saeed Hajarian exposes the callousness of Iran's leaders – and their lack of logic|work=The Guardian|url=https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2009/jul/21/iran-saeed-hajarian-imprisonment/|accessdate=21 July 2009|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; and that according to his wife, physician Vajiheh Marsoussi, his medical condition was "deteriorating severely" while in prison.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://edition.cnn.com/2009/WORLD/meast/07/29/iran.detainee.release/ |title=Reports: 50 'political figures' among Iranian detainees. 30 July 2009.

==2015 speech==
In May 2015, Hajjarian was allowed to give a short speech at [[University of Tehran]]. According to the reformist ''[[Shargh]]'' Daily, enthusiasm for the speech was so great that seats were filled up hours before the event.&lt;ref name="Karami-27-5-2015"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Karami|first1=Arash|title=Reformist media welcomes rare appearance of Hajjarian|url=http://www.al-monitor.com/pulse/originals/2015/05/iran-saeed-hajjarian-reformist-2nd-khordad.html|accessdate=20 September 2016|agency=Al Monitor|date=May 27, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a note he gave to a student to read, Hajjarian stated that the [[Iranian presidential election, 1997|1997 presidential election]] were the reformists prevailed were the first since the 1979 Iranian revolution in which there was “a competition”, and that it “institutionalized” competition in the presidential elections, and introduced new debate on the issues of religion, economics and other foreign and domestic policies. But he believed those elections were an “exception” and doubtful of their repetition, "though he did not explain why", according to al-Monitor.&lt;ref name="Karami-27-5-2015"/&gt;

{{Use dmy dates|date=November 2014}}
[[File:Plast - Scout Salute.jpg|thumb|Ukrainian Girl Scout from [[Plast]] making the Scout Sign.]]
The '''three-finger salute''' is used by members of [[Scouting|Scout and Guide]] organizations around the world when greeting other Scouts and in respect of a national flag at ceremonies. In most situations, the salute is made with the right hand, palm face out, the thumb holding down the little finger, and with the fingertips on the brow of the head. There are some variations of the salute between national Scouting organizations and also within some programme sections.

A "half-salute", known as the Scout Sign, is also used in certain situations. The hand is still held palm facing out, and the thumb holding the little finger, but the hand is held at the shoulder instead. Other organizations with historical ties to Scouting such as [[Scouts Royale Brotherhood]] and [[Alpha Phi Omega]] use it as well.

== Meaning of the three fingers ==
[[Image:1996-Rover Moot-Fahnengruß.jpg|thumb|200px|Scouts using the three-finger salute as the Scout Sign.]]
[[Image:Lebkuchen in Form des Pfadfindergrußes 3755.jpg|thumb|A Christmas cookie as three-finger salute.]]
In his book, ''Scouting for Boys'', [[Robert Baden-Powell, 1st Baron Baden-Powell|Robert Baden-Powell]] chose the three-finger salute for Scouts to represent the three aspects of the [[Scout Promise]]:
# Honor God and Country
# Help Others
# Obey the [[Scout Law]]&lt;ref name="SfB_2005"&gt;{{cite book |first=Robert |last=Baden-Powell |authorlink=Robert Baden-Powell, 1st Baron Baden-Powell |title=[[Scouting for Boys]] |year=2005 |orig-year=First published 1908 |publisher=Oxford |page=37}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Cub Scouts' two-finger salute ===
[[Cub Scout]] sections can use a [[two-finger salute]], depending on the national Scouting organization they belong to. This is done to represent the two rules of the original Cub Scout / Wolf Cub law. In [[The Wolf Cub's Handbook]], Baden-Powell wrote: ''Why two fingers? Well, you know what a Wolf's head looks like with two ears cocked up. It is used as the badge of the Wolf Cub. Your two fingers in the salute are the two ears of the Wolf."''&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thedump.scoutscan.com/wolfcubshandbook.pdf The Wolf Cub's Handbook] (p.15)&lt;/ref&gt; The salute is performed with the right hand.

== Salute or sign? ==
Originally, Baden-Powell intended for Scouts to salute each other in greeting when they first saw each other for the first time using the "secret sign", or half-salute. This was regardless of whether the Scouts knew each other or not. Officers, such as Patrol Leaders, Scoutmasters, or members of the armed forces, were to be saluted with a full-salute.&lt;ref&gt;[http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article88440459 Prahran Chronicle (Vic. : 1914 - 1918)(Saturday 17 July 1915, page 5]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.inquiry.net/traditional/por/general_rules.htm P.O.R. iX. General Rules, Rule 352]&lt;/ref&gt;

Full-salutes were also required at the hoisting of the [[Union Flag]], the playing of the national anthem, or at funerals.&lt;ref name="SfB_2005"/&gt;

== Canada ==
In [[Scouts Canada]] the Salute is rendered vertically, palm out similar to British Army/Commonwealth salutes, except if the member is a Sea Scout where it is palm in/angled down. (Traditionally, to hide your 'dirty hands' from the ship's captain). [[Beavers (Scouting)|Beaver Scouts]] in Canada use a variant of the two-fingered sign with the fingers bent forwards forming "teeth". When they move up to [[Cub Scout]]s part of the ceremony sometimes includes a Scouter straightening the fingers to change from the Beaver to Cub sign.{{citation needed|date=May 2016}}

== Switzerland ==
The half-salute is used by Swiss Scouts when shaking (left) hands with other Scouts or leaders on greeting or parting.

Additional meaning of the thumb holding down the little finger as explained in Switzerland: the big and strong protects the weak and little.

== United Kingdom ==
[[The Scout Association]] uses the three-fingered salute for all sections, including Cub Scouts. The two-fingered Cub salute was abandoned by the Scout Association following a recommendation by the [[The Chief Scouts' Advance Party Report|Advance Party Report]] in 1966, that ''"there should be only one salute for the whole Movement"''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thedump.scoutscan.com/advance66.pdf The Advance Party Report '66] (Recommendation 10, p.14)&lt;/ref&gt;
The Scout Sign is used while making or reaffirming the Beaver Scout, Cub Scout or [[Scout Promise]] and at no other time.&lt;ref&gt;[http://scouts.org.uk/documents/por/2011updates/Chap_12_2011.pdf The Scout Association - Policy, Organisation and Rules - January 2011: Rules 12.5 and 12.6]&lt;/ref&gt;  The [[Baden-Powell Scouts' Association]] uses both the three and two fingered salutes. [[Girlguiding UK]] only uses the Guide Sign (half salute).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.girlguiding.org.uk/about_us/international_guiding/wagggs.aspx GirlguidingUK: World Association of Girl Guides and Girl Scouts (WAGGGS) - Symbols of Unity]&lt;/ref&gt;

== United States of America ==
[[File:Texas Cub Scouts Saluting.jpg|thumb|Texas Cub Scouts Saluting]]

=== Baden-Powell Service Association ===
As a member of [[World Federation of Independent Scouts|WFIS]] and part of the international [[Traditional Scouting]] movement. the scout sign and salute differs by section in the [[Baden-Powell Service Association|BPSA-US]]. The Timberwolf (cub) section uses the two-finger (spread) salute, and the two finger scout salute as defined in the 1938 PO&amp;R,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.inquiry.net/traditional/por/general_rules.htm|title=IX. General Rules|website=www.inquiry.net|access-date=2016-10-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; while the Pathfinder (scout) and Rovers use the traditional three-finger sign and salute.

=== Boy Scouts of America ===
Cub Scouts use the two finger Scout sign and salute— the sign is presented with the fingers apart to represent the ears of [[Akela (Scouting)|Akela]] the wolf.  Boy Scouts{{Update after|2019|02|01|reason=Scouts BSA}}, Varsity Scouts, Venturers and Sea Scouts use the three finger sign and salute. The Scout Sign is performed with the upper arm parallel to the ground and the forearm vertical, forming a right angle at the elbow.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://blog.scoutingmagazine.org/2012/10/17/bsa-to-use-scout-oath-and-scout-law-for-all-programs/ |last=Wendell |first=Bryan |title=BSA to use Scout Oath and Scout Law for all programs |work=Scouting |department=Bryan on Scouting |date=17 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Scout Sign is used when reciting any of the ideals of the BSA such as the Scout Oath and Scout Law. It is also used to gain the attention of the group.

The salute is rendered in the American style with the palm in and is only used to salute the [[flag of the United States]]. Early BSA protocol required Scouts to salute each other, but this was discontinued in 1972.{{citation needed|date=May 2016}}

=== Girl Scouts of the USA ===
As a member of [[WAGGGS]], the [[Girl Scouts of the USA]] use the three-fingered sign at shoulder height. The three fingers represent the person's own spiritual beliefs, other people and the Girl Scout Law. This differs from the 1913 version where the first finger represented God and Country.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Cadette Girl Scout Handbook |publisher =[[Girl Scouts of the USA]] |year=1995 |isbn=0-88441-283-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Worldwide ==
All [[World Association of Girl Guides and Girl Scouts]] members share the three fingered sign, with the palm facing out held at shoulder height, elbow by the side and the thumb holding the little finger. This is used in numerous situations of respect including when making or reciting the [[Scout Promise|Promise]], receiving awards, honouring a flag, honouring the dead and meeting other Girl Guides and Girl Scouts. In the latter case, it may be used in conjunction with the [[Scout handshake|left handshake]].{{citation needed|date=May 2016}}

===Status in Montenegro===

Serbian was the official language of Montenegro until October 2007 when the new [[Constitution of Montenegro]] replaced the Constitution of 1992. Amid opposition from pro-Serbian parties,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.setimes.com/cocoon/setimes/xhtml/en_GB/features/setimes/features/2007/10/26/feature-02|title=''Pro-Serbian parties oppose Montenegro constitution''|author=|date=|website=setimes.com|accessdate=27 April 2018|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160303203139/http://www.setimes.com/cocoon/setimes/xhtml/en_GB/features/setimes/features/2007/10/26/feature-02|archivedate=3 March 2016|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; the [[Montenegrin language]] was made the sole official language of the country, and Serbian was given the status of a recognised minority language along with Bosnian, [[Albanian language|Albanian]], and Croatian.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.snp.co.me/strana.asp?kat=1&amp;id=1278|title=SNP CG|author=|date=|website=www.snp.co.me|accessdate=27 April 2018|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180120000807/http://www.snp.co.me/strana.asp?kat=1&amp;id=1278|archivedate=20 January 2018|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the 2011 Montenegrin census, 42.88% declare Serbian to be their native language, while Montenegrin is declared by 36.97% of the population.

==Differences between standard Serbian and standard Croatian and Bosnian==
{{expand section|date=November 2012}}
{{Main|Comparison of standard Bosnian, Croatian and Serbian}}
{{see also|Serbo-Croatian phonology|Serbo-Croatian grammar}}

==Writing system==
{{main|Serbian Cyrillic alphabet|Gaj's Latin alphabet|Yugoslav Braille}}
Standard Serbian language uses both [[Serbian Cyrillic alphabet|Cyrillic]] ({{lang|sh-Cyrl|ћирилица}}, {{lang|sh-Latn|ćirilica}}) and [[Gaj's Latin alphabet|Latin script]] ({{lang|sh-Latn|latinica}}, {{lang|sh-Cyrl|латиница}}). Serbian is a rare example of synchronic [[digraphia]], a situation where all literate members of a society have two interchangeable writing systems available to them. Media and publishers typically select one alphabet or another.

Although Serbian language authorities have recognized the official status of both scripts in contemporary Standard Serbian for more than half of a century now, due to historical reasons, the Cyrillic script was made the [[official script]] of Serbia's administration by the 2006 [[Constitution of Serbia|Constitution]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = The Constitution | publisher = The Constitutional Court of the Republic of Serbia | url = http://www.ustavni.sud.rs/page/view/en-GB/235-100028/constitution | accessdate = 2010-12-06 | deadurl = no | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20110723055855/http://www.ustavni.sud.rs/page/view/en-GB/235-100028/constitution | archivedate = 2011-07-23 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the law does not regulate scripts in [[standard language]], or standard language itself by any means, leaving the choice of script as a matter of personal preference and to the free will in all aspects of life (publishing, media, trade and commerce, etc.), except in government paperwork production and in official written communication with state officials, which have to be in Cyrillic. 

In media, the public broadcaster, [[Radio Television of Serbia]], predominantly uses the Cyrillic script whereas the privately run broadcasters, like [[RTV Pink]], predominantly use the Latin script. Newspapers are found in both scripts. Outdoor signage, including road signs and commercial displays, predominately uses the Latin alphabet. Larger signs, especially those put up by the government, will often feature both alphabets.

A survey from 2014 showed that 47% of the Serbian population favors the Latin alphabet whereas 36% favors the Cyrillic one.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.b92.net/kultura/vesti.php?nav_category=1087&amp;yyyy=2014&amp;mm=12&amp;dd=16&amp;nav_id=936784|title=Ivan Klajn: Ćirilica će postati arhaično pismo|author=|date=|website=b92.net|accessdate=27 April 2018|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171011114445/http://www.b92.net/kultura/vesti.php?nav_category=1087&amp;yyyy=2014&amp;mm=12&amp;dd=16&amp;nav_id=936784|archivedate=11 October 2017|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Latin script has become more and more popular in Serbia, as it is easier to input on phones and computers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Crosby |first1=Alan |last2=Martinovic |first2=Iva |title=In The Age Of The Internet, Serbia Aims To Keep Its Cyrillic Alive |url=https://www.rferl.org/a/in-the-age-of-the-internet-serbia-aims-to-keep-its-cyrillic-alive/29458055.html |accessdate=5 September 2018 |agency=RFE/RL |date=August 28, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Grammar ==
{{main|Serbo-Croatian grammar}}

Serbian is a highly [[fusional language|inflected language]], with grammatical morphology for nouns, pronouns and adjectives as well as verbs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first1=Celia|last1=Hawkworth|first2=Jelena|last2=Ćalić|title=Colloquial Serbian: The Complete Course for Beginners|publisher=Routledge|year=2006|isbn=9781138949799}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Nouns ===
Serbian nouns are classified into three [[declension]]al types, denoted largely by their [[nominative case]] endings as "-a" type, "-i" and "-e" type. Into each of these declensional types may fall nouns of any of three [[grammatical gender|genders]]: masculine, feminine or neuter. Each noun may be inflected to represent the noun's [[grammatical case]], of which Serbian has seven:

* [[Nominative case|Nominative]]
* [[Genitive case|Genitive]]
* [[Dative case|Dative]]
* [[Accusative case|Accusative]]
* [[Locative case|Locative]]
* [[Vocative case|Vocative]]
* [[Instrumental case|Instrumental]]

Nouns are further inflected to represent the noun's [[grammatical number|number]], singular or plural.

=== Pronouns ===
Pronouns, when used, are inflected along the same case and number morphology as nouns. Serbian is a [[pro-drop language]], meaning that pronouns may be omitted from a sentence when their meaning is easily inferred from the text. In cases where pronouns may be dropped, they may also be used to add emphasis. For example:

{| class="wikitable"
! Serbian !! English equivalent
|-
| ''Kako si?'' || How are you?
|-
| ''A kako si ti?'' || And how are ''you''?
|}

=== Adjectives ===
Adjectives in Serbian may be placed before or after the noun they modify, but must agree in number, gender and case with the modified noun.

===Verbs===
Serbian verbs are conjugated in four past forms—[[perfect (grammar)|perfect]], [[aorist]], [[imperfect]], and [[pluperfect]]—of which the last two have a very limited use (imperfect is still used in some dialects, but the majority of native Serbian speakers consider it archaic), one [[future tense]] (also known as the first future tense, as opposed to the second future tense or the future exact, which is considered a tense of the [[conditional mood]] by some contemporary linguists), and one [[present tense]]. These are the tenses of the [[indicative]] mood. Apart from the indicative mood, there is also the [[imperative mood]]. The conditional mood has two more tenses: the first conditional (commonly used in conditional clauses, both for possible and impossible conditional clauses) and the second conditional (without use in the spoken language—it should be used for impossible conditional clauses). Serbian has active and passive [[Voice (grammar)|voice]].

As for the non-finite verb forms, Serbian has one [[infinitive]], two [[adjectival participle]]s (the active and the passive), and two [[adverbial participle]]s (the present and the past).

==Vocabulary==
 {{See also|Loanwords in Serbian}}
Most Serbian words are of native [[Slavic languages|Slavic]] lexical stock, tracing back to the [[Proto-Slavic language]]. There are many [[loanword]]s from different languages, reflecting cultural interaction throughout history. Notable loanwords were borrowed from Greek, Latin, Italian, Turkish, Hungarian, Russian, and German.

==Serbian literature==
{{Main|Serbian literature}}

[[File:Jevandj.gif|right|thumb|upright=1.15|''[[Miroslav's Gospel|Miroslavljevo jevanđelje]]'' (The Gospel of Miroslav), a [[manuscript]], ca. 1186]]

Serbian literature emerged in the [[Middle Ages]], and included such works as ''Miroslavljevo jevanđelje'' ([[Miroslav's Gospel]]) in 1192 and ''Dušanov zakonik'' ([[Dušan's Code]]) in 1349. Little [[secular]] medieval literature has been preserved, but what there is shows that it was in accord with its time; for example, ''Serbian Alexandride'', a book about [[Alexander the Great]], and a translation of ''[[Tristan and Iseult]]'' into Serbian. Although not belonging to the literature proper, the corpus of Serbian literacy in the 14th and 15th centuries contains numerous legal, commercial and administrative texts with marked presence of Serbian vernacular juxtaposed on the matrix of Serbian [[Church Slavonic language|Church Slavonic]].

By the beginning of the 14th century, Serbian language, which was so rigorously proscribed by earlier local lows, becomes the mother-tongue of the [[Republic of Ragusa]].&lt;ref name="Evans"&gt;[https://books.google.pt/books?id=2VoQAQAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA416&amp;dq=serbia+dubrovnik&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjE5d3E7ubeAhUDuRoKHZ7wAGY4KBDoAQgtMAE#v=onepage&amp;q=serbia%20dubrovnik&amp;f=false Through Bosnia and the Herzegovina on Foot During the Insurrection] by Sir Arthur Evans, page 416&lt;/ref&gt; However, despite her wealthy citizens speaking Serbian dialect of Dubrovnik in their family circles, they sent their children to Florentine schools to acquire perfect knolledge of Italian.&lt;ref name="Evans"/&gt; Since the beginning of the XIII century, entire official correspondence of Dubrovnik with states in the hinterland was conducted in Serbian language.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.plemenito.com/en/language-and-letter-in-medieval-bosnian-state-%E2%80%93-charters-and-letters--/o138 ANGUAGE AND LETTER IN MEDIEVAL BOSNIAN STATE – CHARTERS AND LETTERS] at plemenito.com&lt;/ref&gt;

In the mid-15th century, Serbia was conquered by the [[Ottoman Empire]] and for the next 400 years there was no opportunity for the creation of secular written literature. However, some of the greatest literary works in Serbian come from this time, in the form of oral literature, the most notable form being [[Serbian epic poetry]]. The epic poems were mainly written down in the 19th century, and preserved in oral tradition up to the 1950s, a few centuries or even a millennium longer than by most other "epic folks". [[Johann Wolfgang von Goethe|Goethe]] and [[Jacob Grimm]] learned Serbian in order to read Serbian epic poetry in the original. By the end of the 18th century, the written literature had become estranged from the spoken language. In the second half of the 18th century, the new language appeared, called [[Slavonic-Serbian]]. This artificial idiom superseded the works of poets and historians like Gavrilo Stefanović Venclović, who wrote in essentially modern Serbian in the 1720s. These vernacular compositions have remained cloistered from the general public and received due attention only with the advent of modern literary historians and writers like [[Milorad Pavić (writer)|Milorad Pavić]]. In the early 19th century, [[Vuk Stefanović Karadžić]] promoted the [[spoken language]] of the people as a literary norm.

==Dialects==
{{see also|Dialects of Serbo-Croatian}}

The dialects of [[Serbo-Croatian]], regarded Serbian (traditionally spoken by Serbs), include:
* [[Šumadija–Vojvodina dialect|Šumadija–Vojvodina]] (Ekavian, Neo-Shtokavian): central and northern Serbia
* [[Eastern Herzegovinian dialect|Eastern Herzegovinian]] (Ijekavian, Neo-Shtokavian): southwestern Serbia, western half of Montenegro, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Croatia
* [[Kosovo–Resava dialect|Kosovo–Resava]] (Ekavian, Old-Shtokavian): eastern central Serbia, central Kosovo
* [[Smederevo–Vršac dialect|Smederevo–Vršac]] (Ekavian, Old-Shtokavian): east-central Serbia
* [[Prizren-Timok dialect|Prizren–Timok]] (Ekavian, Old-Shtokavian): southeastern Serbia, southern Kosovo
* [[Zeta-Raška dialect|Zeta–Raška]] (Ijekavian, Old-Shtokavian): eastern half of Montenegro, southwestern Serbia

==Dictionaries==
{{Expand section|date=June 2008}}

[[Vuk Karadžić]]'s ''[[Srpski rječnik]]'', first published in 1818, is the earliest dictionary of modern literary Serbian. The ''Rječnik hrvatskoga ili srpskoga jezika'' (I–XXIII), published by the [[Yugoslav Academy of Sciences and Arts]] from 1880 to 1976, is the only general historical dictionary of Serbo-Croatian. Its first editor was [[Đuro Daničić]], followed by [[Pero Budmani]] and the famous Vukovian [[Tomislav Maretić]]. The sources of this dictionary are, especially in the first volumes, mainly [[Štokavian]]. There are older, pre-standard dictionaries, such as the [[German–Serbian dictionary (1791)|1791 German–Serbian dictionary]].

;Standard dictionaries
*''Rečnik srpskohrvatskog književnog i narodnog jezika'' (Dictionary of Serbo-Croatian standard language and vernaculars) is the biggest dictionary of Serbian and still unfinished. Starting with 1959, 16 volumes were published, about 40 are expected. Works of Croatian authors are excerpted, if published before 1991.
*''Rečnik srpskohrvatskoga književnog jezika'' in six volumes, started as a common project of [[Matica srpska]] and [[Matica hrvatska]], but only the first three volumes were also published in Croato-Serbian (hrvatskosrpski).
* ''Rečnik srpskoga jezika'' ({{ISBN|978-86-7946-004-2}}) in one volume, published in 2007 by [[Matica srpska]], which on more than 1500 pages in [[Paper size|A4 format]] explains more than 85,000 entries. Several volume dictionaries were published in Croatia (for the Croatian language) since the 1990s (''Anić'', ''Enciklopedijski rječnik'', ''Hrvatski rječnik'').

;Etymological dictionaries
The standard and the only completed etymological dictionary of Serbian is the "[[Skok]]", written by the Croatian linguist [[Petar Skok]]: ''Etimologijski rječnik hrvatskoga ili srpskoga jezika'' ("Etymological Dictionary of Croatian or Serbian"). I-IV. [[Zagreb]] 1971–1974.

There is also a new monumental ''[[Etimološki rečnik srpskog jezika]]'' (Etymological Dictionary of Serbian). So far, two volumes have been published: I (with words on A-), and II (Ba-Bd).

There are specialized etymological dictionaries for German, Italian, Croatian, Turkish, Greek, Hungarian, Russian, English and other loanwords (cf. chapter ''word origin'').

'''Simulcast''' (a [[portmanteau]] of '''simultaneous broadcast)''' is the [[broadcasting]] of programs or events across more than one [[Mass media|medium]], or more than one service on the same medium, at exactly the same time (that is, simultaneously). For example, [[Absolute Radio]] is simulcast on both AM and on [[satellite radio]].&lt;ref name="Absolute Radio launch"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.marketingweek.co.uk/cgi-bin/item.cgi?id=62526&amp;d=254&amp;h=5&amp;f=3/|title=Absolute Radio signs exclusive Sony Ericsson ad deal|last=Parry|first=Caroline|date=18 September 2008|accessdate=18 September 2008|work=Marketing Week}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Absolute Radio"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.brandrepublic.com/News/842893/Plans-revealed-rebrand-Virgin-Radio-Absolute/|title=Plans revealed to rebrand Virgin Radio as Absolute|last=Barnett|first=Emma|date=1 September 2008|accessdate=1 September 2008|work=Brand Republic| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20080907014531/http://www.brandrepublic.com/News/842893/Plans-revealed-rebrand-Virgin-Radio-Absolute/| archivedate= 7 September 2008 | deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; Likewise, the [[BBC]]'s [[The Proms|Prom]] [[concert]]s were formerly simulcast on both [[BBC Radio 3]] and [[BBC Television]]. Another application is the transmission of the original-language [[soundtrack]] of movies or TV series over local or [[Internet radio]], with the television broadcast having been [[dubbing (filmmaking)|dubbed]] into a local language.

==Early radio simulcasts==
Before launching stereo radio, experiments were conducted by transmitting left and right channels on different radio channels.  The earliest recorded  found was a broadcast by the BBC in 1926 of a Halle Orchestra concert from Manchester, using the wavelengths of the regional stations and Daventry. (Practical Television, April 1964, p305. see http://www.americanradiohistory.com/Archive-Practical/Television/60s/Practical-Television-1964-04.pdf)

In its earliest days the BBC often transmitted the same programme on the "National Service" and the "Regional Network".

Between 1990 and 1994 the BBC broadcast a channel of entertainment (Radio 5) which offered a wide range of simulcasts, taking programs from the BBC World Service and Radio 1, 2, 3 and 4 for simultaneous broadcast.

==Simulcasting to provide stereo sound for TV broadcasts==
Before stereo TV sound transmission was possible, simulcasting on TV and Radio was a method of effectively transmitting "stereo" sound to music TV broadcasts.  The band [[Grateful Dead]] and their concert "Great Canadian Train Ride" in 1970 was the first TV broadcast of a live concert with FM simulcast. In the 1970s [[WPXI]] in Pittsburgh broadcast a live [[Boz Scaggs]] performance which had the audio simultaneously broadcast on two FM radio stations to create a quadrophonic sound, the first of its kind. The first such transmission in the United Kingdom was in 1975, when the BBC broadcast a recording of [[Van Morrison]]'s London Rainbow Concert simultaneously on BBC2 TV and Radio 2 (see ''[[It's Too Late to Stop Now]]'').

Similarly, in the 1980s, before Multichannel Television Sound or home theater was commonplace in American households, broadcasters would air a [[high fidelity]] version of a television program's audio portion over FM stereo simultaneous with the television broadcast. [[PBS]] stations were the most likely to use this technique, especially when airing a live concert. It was also a way of allowing [[MTV]] and similar music channels to run stereo sound through the cable-TV network. This method required a stereo FM transmitter modulating MTV's stereo soundtrack through the cable-TV network, and customers connecting their FM receiver's antenna input to the cable-TV outlet. They would then tune the FM receiver to the specified frequency that would be published in documentation supplied by the cable-TV provider.

With the introduction of commercial FM stations in Australia in July 1980, commercial TV channels began simulcasting some music based programs with the new commercial FM stations and continued to do so into the early 1990s.  These were initially rock based programs, such as late night music video shows and rock concerts, but later included some major rock musicals such as [[The Rocky Horror Picture Show]] and [[The Blues Brothers]] when they first aired on TV. During the mid 1980s the final Australian concert of several major rock artists such as Dire Straits were simulcast live on a commercial TV and FM station.  The ABC also simulcast some programs on ABC Television and [[ABC Classic FM|ABC FM]], including the final concert of [[Elton John]] with the [[Melbourne Symphony Orchestra]].

The first ever concert "simulcast" was [[Frank Zappa]]'s Halloween shows (October 31, 1981), live from NYC's Palladium and shown on MTV with the audio-only portion simulcast over the FM "Starfleet Radio" network. Engineered by Mark Pinske with the UMRK mobile recording truck. A later, notable application for simulcasting in this context was the [[Live Aid]] telethon concert that was broadcast around the world on July 13, 1985. Most destinations where this concert was broadcast had the concert simulcast by at least one TV network and at least one of the local FM stations.

Most stereo-capable video recorders made through the 1980s and early 1990s had a "simulcast" recording mode where they recorded video signals from the built-in TV tuner and audio signals from the VCR's audio line-in connectors. This was to allow one to connect a stereo FM tuner that is tuned to the simulcast frequency to the VCR's audio input in order to record the stereo sound of a TV program that would otherwise be recorded in mono. The function was primarily necessary with stereo VCRs that didn't have a stereo TV tuner or were operated in areas where stereo TV broadcasting wasn't in place. This was typically selected through the user setting the input selector to "Simulcast" or "Radio" mode or, in the case of some JVC units, the user setting another "audio input" switch from "TV" or "Tuner" to "Line".

In the mid to late 1990s, video game developer [[Nintendo]] utilized simulcasting to provide enhanced [[orchestral]] scoring and voice-acting for the first ever "integrated radio-games"&lt;ref name=bsz1worldfirst&gt;{{cite video game| title = [http://www.f3.dion.ne.jp/~kameb/satella/st_kbn/n58.htm#eb BS-X: Sore wa Namae o Nusumareta Machi no Monogatari]| developer = [[Nintendo]]| publisher = [[Nintendo]]/[[St.GIGA]]| date = February 13, 1995| platform = [[Satellaview]]| version = 1995/8/8| language = Japanese| isolang = ja| quote = '''Kabe shinbunsha''': ８月６日（日）、世界初のジオ／ゲー動プログラム「ＢＳゼルダの伝説」が大好評につき９月の再放送がついに決定した。}}&lt;/ref&gt; – its [[Satellaview]] video games. Whereas digital game data was broadcast to the Satellaview unit to provide the basic game and game sounds, Nintendo's partner, satellite radio company [[St.GIGA]], simultaneously broadcast the musical and vocal portion of the game via radio. These two streams were combined at the Satellaview to provide a unified audiotrack analogous to stereo.&lt;ref&gt;"Satellaview: juegos desde el espacio." ''Atomicx''. pp.54-57. July 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Other uses==
The term "simulcast" (describing simultaneous radio/television broadcast) was coined in 1948 by a press agent at WCAU-TV, Philadelphia.&lt;ref&gt;John Crosby, "Television Headache in Etymology," Oakland (CA) Tribune, 15 June 1948.&lt;/ref&gt; NBC and CBS had begun broadcasting a few programs both to their established nationwide radio audience and to the much smaller—though steadily-growing—television audience. NBC's "Voice of Firestone" was an early example. Toscanini's NBC Symphony performance of 15 March 1952 is perhaps a first instance of radio/TV simulcasting of a concert, predating the much-heralded rock concert simulcasts beginning in the 1980s.

Presently, in the United States, simulcast most often refers to the practice of offering the same programming on an FM and AM station owned by the same entity, in order to cut costs. With the advent of solid state AM transmitters and computers, it has become very easy for AM stations to broadcast a different format without additional cost; therefore, simulcast between FM/AM combinations are rarely heard today outside of rural areas, and in urban areas, where often the talk or [[all-news radio]] format of an AM station is simulcast on FM, mainly for the convenience of office buildings in urban cores which easily block AM signals.

During [[apartheid]] in [[South Africa]], many foreign programmes on [[South African Broadcasting Corporation|SABC]] [[Television in South Africa|television]] were dubbed in [[Afrikaans]]. The original soundtrack, usually in [[English language|English]], but sometimes in [[German language|German]] or [[Dutch language|Dutch]] was available on the Radio 2000 service.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=-NRDAQAAIAAJ&amp;dq=was+simulcast++Radio+2000+afrikaans&amp;focus=searchwithinvolume&amp;q=Radio+2000+afrikaans ''The voice, the vision: a sixty year history of the South African Broadcasting Corporation''], Malcolm Theunissen, Victor Nikitin, Melanie Pillay, Advent Graphics, 1996, page 120&lt;/ref&gt; This could be selected using a button labeled simulcast on many televisions manufactured before 1995.

Radio programs have been simulcast on television since the invention thereof however, as of recent, perhaps the most visible example of radio shows on television is ''[[The Howard Stern Show]]'', which currently airs on [[Howard 100 and Howard 101|Sirius Satellite Radio]] as well as [[Howard Stern television shows#Howard Stern On Demand|Howard TV]]. Another prominent radio show that was simulcast on television is ''[[Imus in the Morning]]'', which until the simulcast ended in 2015, aired throughout the years on [[MSNBC]], [[RFD-TV]] and [[Fox Business Network]], in addition to its radio broadcast distributed by [[Cumulus Media Networks|Citadel Media]]. Multiple [[sports talk]] radio shows, including ''[[Mike &amp; Mike]]'', ''[[The Herd with Colin Cowherd]]'' and ''[[Boomer and Carton]]'' also are carried on television, saving those networks the burden of having to air encores of sporting events or other paid sports programming which may draw lower audiences.

In [[professional wrestling]], a simulcast happened on March 26, 2001 between ''[[WWE Raw|WWF Raw is War]]'' and ''[[WCW Monday Nitro]]'' upon WWE's purchase of WCW's assets to merge the storylines of the two [[professional wrestling promotion|wrestling promotion]]s, which was the last episode of ''Monday Nitro''.

In another case, popular programs will be aired simultaneously on different services in adjacent countries, such as ''[[The Simpsons]]'', airing Sunday evenings at 8:00&amp;nbsp;p.m. (Eastern and Pacific times) on both [[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox]] in the [[United States]] and [[Global Television Network|Global]] in [[Canada]]. "Simulcast" is often a colloquial term for the related Canadian practice of [[simultaneous substitution]] (simsub).

Simulcasts are also used for the purposes of [[Nielsen ratings|television ratings]], mainly with awards ceremonies such as the [[MTV Video Music Awards]] and the [[Nickelodeon Kids' Choice Awards]] where the ceremony airs on other sister channels in the same corporate family. These allow a bulk ratings number to be competed which allows for more homes to be calculated in a final rating, along with removing any in-house competition, with each of the networks carrying the same ceremony and same advertising. Another example is a "roadblock strategy", where a family of networks will air the premiere of a new series, music video or other event such as a [[telethon]] at the same time to maximize their audiences. During major breaking news events, a simulcast of the Fox News Channel is aired on the Fox broadcast network and Fox Business Network.

"Live Simulcast" is also used throughout South America for a real-time live broadcasting from the USA, where it differs from just a live broadcasting in that, on the former case, the event is being broadcast live while it is happening in real time (e.g. the NFL games), while, the latter,  a show may be a live recording but not necessarily being broadcast in real time of when the event took place (e.g. a live concert recording). Yet, local live productions (soccer games, for instance) being broadcast in real time in South America are often just called live, without the use of the word simulcast.

===Simulcasting of sporting events===
In sports, such as American football and baseball, simulcasts are when a single announcer broadcasts [[Sports commentator|play-by-play]] coverage both over television and radio. The practice was common in the early years of television, but since the 1980s, most teams have used a separate team for television and for radio.

As all [[National Football League|NFL]] television broadcasts are done by the national networks or via cable, there are no regular TV-to-radio football simulcasts.  However, NFL rules require that games airing on cable and satellite networks ([[ESPN]], [[NFL Network]]) be simulcast on local over-air TV stations in markets serving the two local teams participating in each game.

Similarly, no current [[National Basketball Association]] teams use a simulcast. [[Al McCoy (announcer)|Al McCoy]] ([[Phoenix Suns|Phoenix]]), [[Chick Hearn]] ([[Los Angeles Lakers|Los Angeles]]), [[Kevin Calabro]] ([[Seattle SuperSonics|Seattle]]) and [[Rod Hundley]] ([[Utah Jazz|Utah]]) were the last NBA team broadcasters to simulcast.

In [[Major League Baseball]], until his retirement in 2016, [[Vin Scully]] continued the practice; however, he simulcasted only the first three innings of [[Los Angeles Dodgers]] games at [[Dodger Stadium]] and other [[National League]] Western Division parks. As a result of his retirement, no MLB team uses a simulcast now.

The practice is more prevalent in the [[National Hockey League]] where 2 teams currently simulcast:
*The [[Buffalo Sabres]] with [[Rick Jeanneret]] and [[Denis Potvin]]
*The [[Dallas Stars]] with [[Dave Strader]] and [[Daryl Reaugh]]

Simulcasts via [[communications satellite|satellite]] can be a challenge, as there is a significant [[Delay (audio effect)|delay]] because of the [[distance]] - nearly {{convert|50000|mi|km}} round-trip - involved. Anything involving [[Data compression#Video|video compression]] (and to some extent [[Data compression#Audio|audio data compression]]) also has an additional significant delay, which is noticeable when watching local [[Television station|TV station]]s on [[direct-broadcast satellite]]s. Even though the process is not instantaneous, this is still considered a simulcast because it is not intentionally stored anywhere.

([[Multiplexing]]—also sometimes called "multicasting"—is something of a reversal of this situation, where multiple program streams are combined into a single broadcast. The two terms are sometimes confused.)

In [[horse racing]], a simulcast is a broadcast of a horse race which allows [[gambling|wagering]] at two or more sites; the simulcast often involves the transmission of wagering information to a central site, so that all bettors may bet in the same [[betting pool]], as well as the broadcast of the race.

The [[San Francisco Giants]] simulcast with the [[Oakland Athletics]] while playing each other on their respective stations and commercials with a mix of [[Sports presenter|broadcasters]] from both teams.

On [[cable television]] systems, analog-digital simulcasting (ADS) means that analog channels are duplicated as [[digital subchannel]]s. Digital tuners are programmed to use the digital subchannel instead of the analog. This allows for smaller, cheaper cable boxes by eliminating the analog tuner and some analog circuitry. On [[Digital video recorder|DVR]]s, it eliminates the need for an [[Moving Picture Experts Group|MPEG]] encoder to convert the analog signal to digital for recording. The primary advantage is the elimination of interference, and as analog channels are dropped, the ability to put 10 or more [[Standard-definition television|SDTV]] (or two [[High-definition television|HDTV]], or various other combinations) channels in its place. The primary drawback is the common problem of over-compression (quantity over quality) resulting in fuzzy pictures and [[pixelation]].

In [[University|universities]] with multiple campuses, simulcasting may be used for a single teacher to teach class to students in two or more locations at the same time, using [[videoconferencing]] equipment.

In many public safety agencies, simulcast refers to the broadcasting of the same transmission on the same frequency from multiple towers either simultaneously, or offset by a fixed number of microseconds. This allows for a larger coverage area without the need for a large number of channels, resulting in increased [[spectral efficiency]]. This comes at the cost of overall poorer voice quality, as multiple sources increase [[multipath interference]] significantly, resulting in what is called simulcast distortion.

With some of the latest Simulcast control equipment for FM radio networks, the distortion experienced is almost in-audible to the human ear. With the introduction of Line Equalisation Modules and Tone Generation Modules, the phasing advance and retard is so well calculated that the distortion is almost entirely averted.

The Tone Generation Module (or TGM) generates a pilot tone at 3300&amp;nbsp;Hz which is then sampled by the Line Equalisation Module (or LEM) which each channel on each radio high site has 2 of located back at the main control site. This then determines the phase shift in the signal and adjusts the transmission accordingly such that all the overlap areas in transmission are in phase with each other.

Singapore is a cosmopolitan city with 42% of its population born outside the country.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.un.org/esa/population/publications/migration/UN_MigStock_2008.pdf "Trends in international migrant stock: The 2008 revision"] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161001161634/http://www.un.org/esa/population/publications/migration/UN_MigStock_2008.pdf |date=1 October 2016 }}, United Nations, Department of Economic and Social Affairs, Population Division (2009).&lt;/ref&gt;{{update inline|date=June 2013}} Singaporeans, even those of the same ethnic group, have many different first languages and cultures. For example, in 2005, among [[Chinese Singaporean]]s, nearly a third spoke English as their main language at home while almost half spoke Mandarin, and the rest spoke various mutually unintelligible [[varieties of Chinese]].&lt;ref name="Singstat General Household Survey 2005 Statistical Release 1: Socio-Demographic and Economic Characteristics Chapter 2"&gt;{{cite web|title=Chapter 2 Education and Language|url=http://www.singstat.gov.sg/publications/publications_and_papers/GHS/general_household_survey_release1/chap2.pdf|website=General Household Survey 2005 Statistical Release 1: Socio-Demographic and Economic Characteristics|publisher=Department of Statistics, Ministry of Trade and Industry, Republic of Singapore|accessdate=7 June 2013|format=pdf|year=2005|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140113221057/http://www.singstat.gov.sg/Publications/publications_and_papers/GHS/general_household_survey_release1/chap2.pdf|archivedate=13 January 2014|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the Indian community, most Singaporeans of Indian descent speak either English or Tamil at home. The English language is now the most popular medium of communication among students from primary school to university. Many families use two or three languages on a regular basis, and English is often one of them. In the past,{{when|date=June 2013}} some children received fewer years of  English education than others. As such, the level of fluency in English among residents in Singapore varies greatly from person to person.{{sfn|Berlin|2015}}{{Incomplete short citation|date=December 2016}}

== Classification of Singapore English ==
Singapore English can be classified into Singapore Standard English (SSE) and Singapore Colloquial English (Singlish).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Cavallaro|first=Francesco|last2=Chin|first2=Ng Bee|date=2009-06-01|title=Between status and solidarity in Singapore|url=http://www3.ntu.edu.sg/home/cfcavallaro/Pdf%20files/Cavallaro%20and%20Ng%20WE2009.pdf|journal=World Englishes|language=en|volume=28|issue=2|pages=143–159|doi=10.1111/j.1467-971X.2009.01580.x|issn=1467-971X|citeseerx=10.1.1.530.1479}}&lt;/ref&gt; The language consists of three sociolects; [[Acrolect]], [[Mesolect]], and [[Basilect]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Harada|first1=Shinichi|title=The Roles of Singapore Standard English and Singlish|url=http://www.bunkyo.ac.jp/faculty/lib/slib/kiyo/Inf/if40/if4006.pdf|accessdate=4 August 2014|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130602055518/http://www.bunkyo.ac.jp/faculty/lib/slib/kiyo/Inf/if40/if4006.pdf|archivedate=2 June 2013|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Both Acrolect and Mesolect are regarded as Standard Singapore English, while Basilect is considered as Singlish.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Harada|first1=Shinichi|title=The Roles of Standard Singapore English and Singlish|url=http://www.bunkyo.ac.jp/faculty/lib/slib/kiyo/Inf/if40/if4006.pdf|accessdate=4 August 2014|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130602055518/http://www.bunkyo.ac.jp/faculty/lib/slib/kiyo/Inf/if40/if4006.pdf|archivedate=2 June 2013|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Singaporeans vary their language according to social  situations (Pakir 1991) and attitudes that they want to convey (Poedjosoedarmo 1993).&lt;ref name="videoweb.nie.edu.sg"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Deterding|first1=David|last2=Hvitfeldt|first2=Robert|title=The Feature of Singapore English Pronunciation: Implication for Teachers|journal=Teaching and Learning|volume=15|pages=98–107|url=http://videoweb.nie.edu.sg/phonetic/papers/teach-sge.pdf|accessdate=4 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The better educated Singaporeans who have a "higher" standard of English,  tend to speak "Standard" Singapore English (the acrolect). On the other hand, and typically the less-educated or Singaporeans whose first language isn't English,  speak Singlish (the basilect).&lt;ref name="videoweb.nie.edu.sg"/&gt; Gupta (1994) said that most Singaporean speakers systematically alternate between colloquial and formal language depending on the formality of the situation.&lt;ref name="videoweb.nie.edu.sg"/&gt; The constant use of both SSE and Singlish has resulted in the gradual emergence of a mesolect, an intermediate form of Singapore English, half-way between formal and informal Singapore English.&lt;ref name="videoweb.nie.edu.sg"/&gt;

Standard Singapore English is the standard form of English used in Singapore. It generally resembles British English and is often used in more formal settings such as the workplace or when communicating with people of higher authority such as teachers, bosses and government officials.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Roles of Singapore Standard English and Singlish|url=http://www.bunkyo.ac.jp/faculty/lib/slib/kiyo/Inf/if40/if4006.pdf|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130602055518/http://www.bunkyo.ac.jp/faculty/lib/slib/kiyo/Inf/if40/if4006.pdf|archivedate=2 June 2013|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Singapore English acts as the "bridge" among different ethnic groups in Singapore&lt;ref name="Leimgruber"/&gt; Standard Singapore English retains British spelling&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=What are some commonly misspelled English words?|url=http://blogs.nlb.gov.sg/ask/children/481|publisher=National Library Board, Singapore|accessdate=7 June 2013|date=18 April 2008|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120303222846/https://blogs.nlb.gov.sg/ask/children/481|archivedate=3 March 2012|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; and grammar.{{Citation needed|date=June 2013}}.

===History===

The British established a trading post on the island of Singapore in 1819, and the population grew rapidly thereafter, attracting many immigrants from Chinese provinces and from India.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title = Singapore English |url= https://books.google.com/?id=VP_HO_Q5rEUC&amp;pg=PR4&amp;dq=american+influence+on+singaporean+english#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|isbn= 9780748625451|last1= Deterding|first1= David|year= 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; The roots of Standard Singapore English derive from nearly a century and a half of British control. Its local character seems to have developed early in the English-medium schools of the 19th and early-20th centuries, where the teachers often came from [[India]] and [[Ceylon]], as well as from various parts of Europe and from the [[United States|United States of America]]. By 1900 [[Eurasian (mixed ancestry)|Eurasian]]s and other locals were employed as teachers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last= Gupta|first= Anthea Fraser|title= The Step-Tongue: Children's English in Singapore|year= 1994|publisher= WBC Ltd, Bridgend|location= United Kingdom|isbn= 978-1-85359-230-0|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=_Wsh1EbUJB0C&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; Apart from a period of [[Japanese occupation of Singapore|Japanese occupation]] (1942-1945), Singapore remained a British colony until 1963, when it joined the [[Malaysian Federation]], but this proved a short-lived alliance, largely due to ethnic rivalries. Since [[Singapore in Malaysia#Expulsion|its expulsion from the Federation in 1965]], Singapore has operated as an independent [[city-state]]. English served as the administrative language of the British colonial government, and when Singapore [[Self-governance of Singapore|gained self-government]] in 1959 and independence in 1965, the Singaporean government decided to keep English as the main language to maximise economic prosperity. The use of English as the nation's first language serves to bridge the gap between the diverse ethnic groups in Singapore; English operates as the ''[[lingua franca]]'' of the nation. The use of English - as the global language for commerce, technology and science - also helped to expedite Singapore's development and integration into the global economy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last= Alatis|first= James E|title= Georgetown University Round Table on Languages and Linguistics 1999|url= http://repository.library.georgetown.edu/bitstream/handle/10822/551456/gurt-1999.pdf?sequence=1|publisher= Georgetown University Press|accessdate= 7 June 2013|author2= Tan, Ai-Hui|location= United States|format= pdf|year= 1999|deadurl= yes|archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20140715182810/https://repository.library.georgetown.edu/bitstream/handle/10822/551456/gurt-1999.pdf?sequence=1|archivedate= 15 July 2014|df= dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Public schools use English as the main language of instruction, although students are also required to receive part of their instruction in their mother tongue; placement in such courses is based on ethnicity and not without controversy.&lt;ref&gt;

The standard Singaporean accent used to be officially [[Received Pronunciation|RP]]. However, in recent decades,{{when|date=June 2013}} a standard Singaporean accent, quite independent of any external standard, including RP, started to emerge. A 2003 study by the [[National Institute of Education]] in Singapore suggests that a standard Singaporean pronunciation is emerging and is on the cusp of being standardised.&lt;ref&gt;

=== Singapore’s Speak Good English Movement ===
The wide use of Singlish led the government to launch the [[Speak Good English Movement|Speak Good English movement]] in Singapore in 2000 in an attempt to replace Singlish with Standard English. This movement was made to show the need for Singaporeans to speak Standard English. Nowadays, all children in schools are being taught Standard English with one of the other official languages (Chinese, Malay, Tamil) being taught as a second language.  In Singapore, English is a “working language” that serves the economy and development and is associated with the broader global community. Meanwhile, the rest are “mother tongues” that are associated with the country’s culture. Speaking Standard English also helps Singaporeans communicate and express themselves in their everyday life.
&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title=Creative destruction: Singapore's Speak Good English movement|journal=World Englishes|volume=20|issue=3|pages=341–355|doi=10.1111/1467-971X.00219|year=2001|last1=Rubdy|first1=Rani}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The Singaporean government recently made an announcement named “Speak Good English Movement brings fun back to Grammar and good English” where the strategies used to promote their program are explained. Specifically, it would  release a series of videos that demystify the difficulty and dullness of the grammatical rules of the English language. These videos provide a more humorous approach to learning basic grammar rules. Singaporeans will now be able to practise the grammatical rules in both written and spoken English thanks to a more interactive approach.

=== Standard Singaporean accent ===
Like most Commonwealth countries outside of Canada and Australia, the accents of most reasonably educated Singaporeans who speak English as their first language are more similar to British [[Received Pronunciation]] (RP) than [[General American]], although immediately noticeable differences exist.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Foley|first=Joseph|title=New Englishes: The Case of Singapore|year=1988|publisher=Singapore University Press|isbn=978-9971-69-114-1|url=https://books.google.com/?id=2D9-DjSLnWIC&amp;pg=PA129&amp;lpg=PA129&amp;dq=singapore+received+pronunciation#v=onepage&amp;q=singapore%20received%20pronunciation&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is the same for people who speak English as their second language.{{Citation needed|date=June 2013}}

=== Malay, Indian, and Chinese Influences ===
Although Standard Singapore English (SSE) is mainly influenced by British English and, recently, American English, there are other languages that also contribute to its use on a regular basis. The majority of Singaporeans speak more than one language, with many speaking three to four.&lt;ref name="Singapore Colloquial English"&gt;{{cite web | first1=Anthea | last1=Gupta | url=http://www.hawaii.edu/satocenter/langnet/definitions/singlish.html | title=Singapore Colloquial English | publisher=University of Hawaii | accessdate=4 August 2014 | website=University of Hawaiʻi}}&lt;/ref&gt; Most Singaporean children are brought up bilingual. They are introduced to Malay, Chinese, Tamil, or Singapore Colloquial English (Singlish) as their native languages, depending on their families' ethnic backgrounds and/or socioeconomic status. They also acquire those languages from interacting with friends in school and other places. Naturally, the presence of other languages in Singapore has influenced Singapore English, something particularly apparent in Singlish.&lt;ref name="Singapore Colloquial English"/&gt;

Both Singapore English and Singapore colloquial English are used with multiple accents. Words from Malay, Chinese, and Tamil are also borrowed, if not code-switched, into Singapore English. For example, the [[Malay language|Malay]] words “makan” (to eat), “habis” (finished), and the [[Hokkien]] word "[[kiasu]]" are constantly used and adopted to SE vocabularies, to the point that Singaporeans are not necessarily aware of which language those words are from. Furthermore, the word “kiasu” has been used in the Singapore press since 2000 without being [[Italic type|italicised]]; Kiasu means "always wanting the best for oneself and willing to try hard to get it".&lt;ref name="Singapore Colloquial English"/&gt; In another journal, "Kiasu" is also defined as 'characterized by a grasping or selfish attitude arising from a fear of missing out on something' (usu. adj., definition from OED (Simpson and Weiner 2000); Hokkien kia(n)su).&lt;ref name="Leimgruber"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Leimgruber|first1=Jakob|title=Singapore English|url=http://jakobleimgruber.ch/papers/LLC.pdf|accessdate=4 August 2014|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160303221040/http://jakobleimgruber.ch/papers/LLC.pdf|archivedate=3 March 2016|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Foreign dialects of English in Singapore ==
{{Further|Indian English|Eurasians in Singapore}}

A wide range of foreign English dialects can be heard in Singapore. American and British accents are often heard on local television and radio due to the frequent airing of foreign television programmes.&lt;!-- The following reference only shows some of the programmes aired on the English-language MediaCorp Channel 5.--&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Channel 5 on xinmsn Entertainment|url=http://entertainment.xin.msn.com/en/tv/channel-5/programmes/|publisher=xinmsn Entertainment|accessdate=7 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Indian accent, spoken by Indian expatriates, can also be heard daily on the streets of Singapore. In addition, accents originating from Hong Kong, China, Indonesia, Australia and Malaysia, with some possibly from Latin American countries, can also be heard among the population.{{Citation needed|date=May 2010}}

== Singapore Colloquial English / Singlish ==
{{Main|Singlish}}

[[Singlish]] is an [[English-based creole language]]&lt;ref name="latrobe.edu.au"&gt;[http://www.latrobe.edu.au/rclt/ALS2009/abstracts/Yoong.pdf] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120330162432/http://www.latrobe.edu.au/rclt/ALS2009/abstracts/Yoong.pdf|date=30 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; spoken in Singapore. Unlike SSE, Singlish includes many discourse particles and loan words from [[Malay language|Malay]], [[Singaporean Mandarin|Mandarin]] and [[Singaporean Hokkien|Hokkien]]. Many of such loan words include swear words, such as Kanina and Chee Bai&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.guidesify.com/blog/2017/08/13/singlish-phrases-define-singapore/|title=Singlish Guide: 125 Phrases/Words That Define SG (Singaporean English)|website=www.guidesify.com|language=en-GB|access-date=2018-09-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;. Hence, it is commonly regarded with low prestige in the country and not used in formal communication.&lt;ref name="bunkyo.ac.jp"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Mercer|first=Neil|title=Using English: From Conversation to Canon|year=1996|publisher=Routledge|location=United Kingdom|isbn=0 415 13120 0|page=229|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=zAct-WT7ywcC&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|author2=Maybin, Janet|quote=Another interesting feature of Lee's songs is the (nonstandard) pronunciation of Singapore English speakers in [...] playful use of features of Singaporean English that have strong cultural connotations, Dick Lee is successfully able to [...]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, Singlish has been used in several locally produced films, including ''[[Army Daze]]'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Mair|first=Victor|title=Wah piang eh!

Some local sitcoms, in particular ''[[Phua Chu Kang|Phua Chu Kang Pte Ltd]]'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Srilal|first=Mohan|title=Quick Quick: 'Singlish' is out in re-education campaign|url=http://www.atimes.com/se-asia/AH28Ae05.html|publisher=Asia Times Online|accessdate=7 June 2013|date=28 August 1999}}&lt;/ref&gt; also feature extensive use of Singlish.

The proliferation of Singlish has been controversial and the use of Singlish is not endorsed by the government. Singapore's first two prime ministers, [[Lee Kuan Yew]] and [[Goh Chok Tong]], have publicly declared&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Deterding|first=David|title=Singapore English|year=2007|publisher=Edinburgh University Press|location=United Kingdom|pages=90–91|isbn=978 0 7486 2544 4|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=VP_HO_Q5rEUC&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; that Singlish is a substandard variety that handicaps Singaporeans, presents an obstacle to learning standard English, and renders the speaker incomprehensible to everyone except another Singlish speaker. The country's third and current prime minister, [[Lee Hsien Loong]], has also said that Singlish should not be part of Singapore's identity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Au Young|first=Jeremy|title=Singlish?

Despite strong criticisms of Singlish, linguist David Yoong has put forward the argument that "Singaporeans who subscribe to Singlish and have a positive attitude towards the code see Singlish as a language that transcends social barriers" and that the language can be used to "forge rapport and, perhaps more importantly, the Singaporean identity".&lt;ref name="latrobe.edu.au"/&gt; Sociolinguist Anthea Fraser Gupta also argues that Singlish and standard English can and do co-exist, saying that "there is no evidence that the presence of Singlish causes damage to standard English".{{Citation needed|date=June 2013}}

== English language trends in Singapore ==
In 2010, speakers of English in Singapore were classified into five different groups: 
# Those who have no knowledge of English (very few people, most of whom were born before the 1950s);
# Those who regard English as a foreign language, have limited command of, and seldom speak the language (mostly the older age groups, people, the less educated young);
# Those who learnt English at school and can use it but have a dominant other language (many people, of all ages);
# Those who learnt English at school and use it as their dominant language (many people, of all ages);

{{As of|2015}}, English is the most commonly spoken language in all Singaporean homes. One effect of mass immigration into Singapore since 2000, especially from China, has been to increase the proportion of the population to whom English is a foreign language. The trend favours an increasing use of English, and stability in Mandarin use at the expense of other [[varieties of Chinese]] (apparently as the Chinese population switches first to Mandarin, then to English), whilst Malay use slowly erodes and Tamil use remains stable.{{Citation needed|date=June 2013}}

'''Social undermining '''is the expression of negative emotions directed towards a particular person or negative evaluations of the person as a way to prevent the person from achieving his or her [[goal]]s. This behavior can often be attributed to certain feelings, such as dislike or [[anger]]. The negative evaluation of the person may involve [[criticizing]] his or her actions, efforts or characteristics.&lt;ref name="Joseph, N. T. 2011"&gt;Joseph, N. T., Myers, H. F., Schettino, J. R., Olmos, N. T., Bingham-Mira, C., Lesser, I. M., &amp; Poland, R. E. (2011). Support and undermining in interpersonal relationships are associated with treatment response to a trial of antidepressant medication. Psychiatry: Interpersonal And Biological Processes, 74(3), 240-254.&lt;/ref&gt; Social undermining is seen in relationships between family members, friends, personal relationships and [[office politics|co-workers]]. Social undermining can affect a person's mental health, including an increase in depressive symptoms. This behavior is only considered social undermining if the person's perceived action is intended to hinder their target. When social undermining is seen in the work environment the behavior is used to hinder the co-worker's ability to establish and maintain a positive [[interpersonal relationship]], success and a good [[reputation]].&lt;ref name="Greenbaum"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Greenbaum | first1 = R. L. | last2 = Mawritz | first2 = M. | last3 = Eissa | first3 = G. | year = 2012 | title = Bottom-line mentality as an antecedent of social undermining and the moderating roles of core self-evaluations and conscientiousness | url = | journal = Journal of Applied Psychology | volume = 97 | issue = 2| pages = 343–359 | doi=10.1037/a0025217 | pmid=22268488}}&lt;/ref&gt; Examples of how an employee can use social undermining in the work environment are behaviors that are used to delay the work of co-workers, to make them look bad or slow them down, competing with co-workers to gain status and recognition and giving co-workers incorrect or even misleading information about a particular job.&lt;ref name="Greenbaum"/&gt;

==Definition==
According to Duffy, Gangster, and Pagon, 2002, the definition of social undermining in a workplace is, behavior intended to hinder over time and not allowing a person to establish or maintain positive interpersonal relationships.&lt;ref name=duffy&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Duffy | first1 = M.K. | last2 = Ganster | first2 = D.C. | last3 = Pagon | first3 = M | year = 2002 | title = Social undermining in the workplace | url = | journal = Academy of Management Journal | volume = 45 | issue = 2| pages = 331–352 | doi=10.2307/3069350| jstor = 3069350 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==In the workplace==
Social undermining has been very effective in the workplace.&lt;ref name=duffy/&gt; Various aspects of social undermining have affected the workplace and specific races. In workplaces, social undermining has connection with social interaction. Research has shown if a person has a supportive environment in their work setting, they are more likely to have a more satisfied life. Research has shown that social undermining exists in a separate and distinct continuum when looking at positive workplace behavior (e.g. [[social support]]).{{citation needed|date=September 2015}}

Social undermining can arise through interactions with co-workers and supervisors; these interactions have an effect on the workers that are being undermined and can affect their work performance. Vinokur found that those who alleged to have social undermining in the workplace reported to have poorer mental health and experienced less well-being.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Vinokur | first1 = A. D. | last2 = Van Ryn | first2 = M. | year = 1993 | title = Social support and undermining in close relationships: Their independent effects on the mental health of unemployed persons | url = | journal = Journal of Personality and Social Psychology | volume = 65 | issue = 2| pages = 350–359 | doi = 10.1037/0022-3514.65.2.350 | citeseerx = 10.1.1.502.7301 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The study shows that undermining has a significant role in worker-supervisor and co-worker relationship and that it leads to various different outcomes such as feelings of irritability, [[anxiety]], [[depersonalization]], and depression. It shows that social undermining affects a person's work ethics and well being.

Various different empirical studies have found that undermining has three specific factors{{which|date=September 2015}} that develop counterfactual thoughts. For example: "what would my life be like if I were not the target of undermining?" These studies' findings{{which|date=September 2015}} indicate that "this rift plays a role in determining the magnitude of the employee's reaction to the event by making the deprived state more salient".&lt;ref name=folger1998&gt;Folger, R., &amp; Cropanzano, R.

Behaviors of social undermining can affect a person and his or her perceptions. The study conducted by Gant et al. addressed African American workers' perceptions of co-workers and supervisors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Gant |first1=LM |last2=Nagda |first2=BA |last3=Brabson |first3=HV |last4=Jayaratne |first4=S |last5=Chess |first5=WA |last6=Singh |first6=A |title=Effects of social support and undermining on African American workers' perceptions of coworker and supervisor relationships and psychological well-being |journal=Social Work |volume=38 |issue=2 |pages=158–64 |year=1993 |pmid=8480245}}&lt;/ref&gt; The research by Duffy, Gangster, Shaw, Johnson, and Pagon&lt;ref name=duffy/&gt; addressed the fairness theory introduced by Folger and Cropanzano 1998.&lt;ref name=folger1998/&gt; The fairness theory suggests that when individuals face negative situations (such as being undermined by coworkers or supervision) they make cognitive comparisons known as counterfactual thoughts; i.e., they compare what actually happened to what might have been.&lt;ref&gt;Kasimatis, M., &amp; Wells, G. (1995). Individual differences in counter-factual thinking. In N. Roese &amp; J. Olson (Eds.), What might have been: The social psychology of counterfactual thinking (pp. 81–102). New York: Lawrence Erlbaum&lt;/ref&gt; The results show that social undermining is closely related to attitudes and behavior regarding one person being or feeling "singled out".

===Envy===
While social undermining can affect a person's behavior and attitude on their job, it can also bring about [[envy]]. Envy can have a positive or negative effect: positive effects include increased performance or attempts at self-improvement. However, envy can have some very harmful effects, including aggression or crime. It can lead to belittling, gossip, withholding information, and giving someone the silent treatment.{{Citation needed|date=March 2014}}

===Abusive supervision===
{{Main article|Abusive supervision}}
Abusive [[Supervisor|supervision]] can arise in different areas such as in the household, at school, and at a workplace. "Abusive supervision has been investigated as an antecedent to negative subordinate workplace outcome" ;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Tepper | first1 = B. J. | year = 2000 | title = Consequences of abusive supervision | url = | journal = Academy of Management Journal | volume = 43 | issue = 2| pages = 178–190 | doi=10.2307/1556375| jstor = 1556375 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Hoobler, J. M., Tepper, B. J., &amp; Duffy, M. K. ( 2000). Moderating effects of coworkers' organizational citizenship behavior on relationships between abusive supervision and subordinates' attitudes and psychological distress. Paper presented at the annual meeting of the Southern Management Association, Orlando, FL.&lt;/ref&gt;  "Workplace violence has combination of situational and personal factors" (e.g., Barling, 1996). The study that was conducted looked at the link between abusive supervision and different workplace events. Social undermining can arise from abusive supervision, such as when a supervisor uses negative actions and it leads to "flow downhill";  a supervisor is perceived as abusive.

Research has shown that "abusive supervision is a subjective assessment made by subordinates regarding their supervisors"  behavior towards them over a period of time.&lt;ref name=hoobler&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Hoobler | first1 = J. M. | last2 = Brass | first2 = D. J. | year = 2006 | title = Abusive supervision and family undermining as displaced aggression | url = | journal = Journal of Applied Psychology | volume = 91 | issue = 5| pages = 1125–1133 | doi = 10.1037/0021-9010.91.5.1125 | pmid=16953773}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, abusive supervision includes a "boss demeaning, belittling, or invading privacy of the subordinate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Adams | first1 = S. H. | last2 = John | first2 = O. P. | year = 1997 | title = A hostility scale for the California Psychological Inventory: MMPI, observer Q-sort, and Big-five correlates | url = | journal = Journal of Personality Assessment | volume = 69 | issue = 2| pages = 408–424 | doi=10.1207/s15327752jpa6902_11| pmid = 9392898 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Hostile attribution bias]] is an extra punitive mentality where individuals tend to [[Psychological projection|project]] [[blame]] on others. Researchers wanted to see how hostile attribution bias can moderate the relationship between perceptions of psychological contract violation and subordinates' perceptions of abusive supervision. Undermining does arise with abusive supervision, which affects families and aggression; they believe that there is a stronger positive relationship between experiences of psychological contract violation and subordinates' reports of abuse. It suggests that when someone has a negative work environment, it will affect their emotional training ground where this would result in negative home encounters. The findings from this study show that abused subordinates' family members reported a higher incidence of undermining in their home. When this occurs, complications arise at both home and work. Workplace abuse may be spawning negative interpersonal relations in the home, which may contribution to a downward spiral of relationships in both spheres.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Andersson | first1 = L. M. | last2 = Pearson | first2 = C. M. | year = 1999 | title = Tit for tat? The spiraling effect of incivility in the workplace | url = | journal = Academy of Management Review | volume = 24 | issue = 3| pages = 452–471 | doi=10.5465/amr.1999.2202131}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When a subordinate is being abused, it can lead to negative affect towards their family where the subordinate starts undermining their family members. The undermining can arise from displaced aggression which is "redirection of a [person's] harm doing behavior from a primary to a secondary target" (Tedeschi &amp; Norman, 1985, p.&amp;nbsp;30). Family undermining arises from a negative work environment: when someone above you puts you down, one starts to think that one should be put down by one's family members.&lt;ref name=hoobler/&gt;

===Bottom-line mentality===
[[Bottom line]] is defined as profits or losses of a business. Greenbaum and colleagues found that some employees tend to focus on a bottom-line outcome, which may be related to their tendency to engage in social undermining behavior.&lt;ref name="Greenbaum"/&gt; Employees with a bottom line mentality (BLM) tend to focus on only the bottom line, and to neglect other outcomes of their actions, including interpersonal consequences. Research has found that a bottom-line mentality can cause a problem, especially if the employer uses BLM as an objective for them to strive for. If someone is hurt by their actions it is not a priority for those with a BLM.{{Citation needed|date=March 2014}}

Employees that have a BLM may learn these actions from their supervisors. BLMs can cause rivalries within the organization since the employee may feel as if the organization should have a winner or loser when it comes to completing work. Employees with this approach think of their work as a game where the winner takes all instead of working with other employees to make sure everyone is contributing to the work that needs to be completed. The competitiveness that is created between the coworkers is to attain bottom-line outcomes. When the employees are trying to attain bottom-line outcomes, with this winner-take-all mentality, they begin to want their co-workers to fail as that consequently means, to them, they, the undermining employee, must be succeeding. The supervisor's BLM causes employee social undermining. This happens because the employees may role-model after the adopted supervisor's BLM. Employee personality also plays a role in the relationship between BLM and undermining. Employees that have confidence in their work ability rely on their work ethic while employees who are low in confidence are more likely to engage in social undermining behavior to make themselves look better when it comes to the bottom line of success.&lt;ref name="Greenbaum"/&gt;

==Individual differences==

Research suggests that whether or not someone engages in [[social support]] or social undermining depends upon their own [[goal]]s. Those with [[compassionate]] goals are more likely to be supportive of others, while those who have more selfish motives believe that people should take care of themselves. When people have goals to preserve their own self-image this can undermine their compassionate goals and make them less supportive.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Crocker | first1 = J. | last2 = Canevello | first2 = A. | year = 2008 | title = Creating and undermining social support in communal relationships: The role of compassionate and self-image goals | url = | journal = Journal of Personality and Social Psychology | volume = 95 | issue = 3| pages = 555–575 | doi = 10.1037/0022-3514.95.3.555 | pmid=18729694}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Health==
Research{{which|date=May 2015}} has shown that social undermining can have an effect on a person's health. It has been shown that social undermining can cause depressive symptoms. Depending on the relationship between a patient and their loved one, the loved one can support or undermine the patient and can even do both within the same interaction, which can increase the depressive symptoms. Creating more social support can improve treatment outcomes of a patient depending on the type of stress level the person is enduring.

Research by Joseph et al.&lt;ref name="Joseph, N. T. 2011"/&gt; found that when participants are exposed to high levels of social undermining and even high levels of social support it can improve the participants course of antidepressive treatment. High levels of social support and social undermining could reduce and also cause remission of the participant's depressive symptoms. The study found that African American participants who had low levels of social undermining were able to fare better than the Caucasians participants in reducing their symptoms. When both groups of participants were given high levels of social undermining the African American participants had fewer achievements in symptom reduction, while the Caucasians participants had the reverse effect of symptom reduction.

A 2007 study conducted by Benyamini, Medalion and Garfinkel showed that support from a spouse while being seriously ill helped a person to cope with their illness.&lt;ref name=benyamini&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Benyamini | first1 = Y. | last2 = Medalion | first2 = B. | last3 = Garfinkel | first3 = D. | year = 2007 | title = Patient and spouse perceptions of the patient's heart disease and their associations with received and provided social support and undermining | url = | journal = Psychology &amp; Health | volume = 22 | issue = 7| pages = 765–785 | doi=10.1080/14768320601070639}}&lt;/ref&gt; Their study used patients who had heart disease. The intention of the study was to find if positive and negative interactions between the patients who have heart disease and their spouse can cause spouse support or spouse undermining. The researchers found that when the patient considered their illness as being negative (e.g., especially painful or likely to be chronic) they tended to want more support from the spouse and tended  to feel as if their spouse was not providing sufficient support. This could cause the patient to believe that they were experiencing social undermining. Other times, the partner's actions could cause the patient to feel as if the spouse was acting critical towards them. This could turn into social undermining, causing the spouse to think that the patient was not taking their condition seriously. When the spouse showed that the illness was serious, it could sometimes cause the spouse to become over-protective of the partner. This could also cause the spouse to be critical of their partner behavior, and the partner could provide less support for the patient. The results of the study were that when a spouse had negative views of the illness, he or she engaged in both more support and more undermining.&lt;ref name=benyamini/&gt;

Research conducted by Horwitz et al. (1998){{full citation needed|date=January 2015}} found that spouse undermining was almost twice as large as the effect for support. For example, a spouse that shows behaviors of withdrawal, avoidance and being overly critical can cause psychological distress in a relationship. This in turn causes stress that increases the depressive symptoms on individuals that have endure high levels of social undermining. This can happen, because the support that a person can get from their spouse compared to a close friend is more exclusive and generally involves more frequent and emotionally intense interactions (Cutrone 1996;{{full citation needed|date=January 2015}} Vinokur &amp; Vinokur &amp; Vinokur- Kaplan, 1990){{full citation needed|date=January 2015}} and depending on their relationship that can influence the social support or even the social undermining that affect the relationship.

Cranford found that spouse undermining and not spouse support can increase depressive symptoms within that relationship. Social undermining has been found to be a stronger indicator for psychological adaption than social support. When there is social undermining in a relationship it can have fatal effects on the spouse's ability to deal with other stressors. It can also lead to an increase of wishful thinking, poor psychological adjustment, maladaptive coping behaviors, and even decrease adaptive coping behaviors. This can give more attention to coping resources and it takes away from other stressors which causes the couple to have fewer chances resolving their problems. If the couple cannot resolve their problems it can cause marital conflict. Social undermining within the relationship can cause negative effects on the spouse physical health and can make the spouse vulnerable to different stressors. This can lead to depressive symptoms that can lessen the spouse self-esteem.&lt;ref&gt;&lt;span class="citation journal"&gt;{{Cite journal

===Nutrition and exercise===
Research has shown that partners that offer social support can also offer social undermining. An example of this is when family members try to undermine [[parenting styles]] in order to raise healthy children.{{citation needed|date=January 2015}} 
Another study found that participants who endure social undermining regarding their eating and exercise behavior,  try to ignore the pressure, and the undermining affects their exercise decisions more than eating decisions.{{citation needed|date=January 2015}}

Market, Stanforth, and Garcia found that social undermining used by family members, friends and coworkers can affect daily activities. Social undermining can affect exercise routines when their exercise routines can conflict with seeing friends or even coworkers. Friends and coworkers can influence the person to skip their exercise, even when a spouse is concerned about their well being. The study also showed that social undermining can affect men and women differently.  Men tend to feel as if they can overcome social undermining because they were still able to make a healthy eating decision. Women have stated that they tend to make bad eating decision when they are eating with other people such as their friends. Social undermining pressures can cause serious challenges when a person is trying to maintain healthy eating and trying to stay active. The study found that people that engage in undermining behavior tend to feel guilty about their own unhealthy behavior and may feel jealous of someone else maintaining their healthy behavior when they cannot achieve the same behavior. The study also suggests when a person is satisfied with their weight it can help the person resist against social undermining. By being satisfied with one's own weight can reduce the likelihood of social undermining in social situations when having dinner with friends. So when a person is not satisfied with their weight they receive more social undermining pressures from the people around them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Mackert | first1 = M. | last2 = Stanforth | first2 = D. | last3 = Garcia | first3 = A. A. | year = 2011 | title = Undermining of nutrition and exercise decisions: Experiencing negative social influence | url = | journal = Public Health Nursing | volume = 28 | issue = 5| pages = 402–410 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Mental health===
Social undermining and social support can have opposite effects on a person that can be negative or positive depending on the person or even the relationship. Being in a close relationship can provide a person both social undermining and social support. Example of these relationships can be an abusive relationship that offers low support and high undermining. A typical healthy close relationship has high support and low undermining. In a relationship between an adolescent and a parent, their relationship can offer high levels of support and even undermining. Depending on the relationship, patterns can change over time based on the characteristics and the situation of the relationship. Whether a relationship is positive or negative can have devastating effects.&lt;ref name="Vinokur, A. D. 1993"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Vinokur | first1 = A. D. | last2 = Van Ryn | first2 = M. | year = 1993 | title = Social support and undermining in close relationships: Their independent effects on the mental health of unemployed persons | url = | journal = Journal of Personality and Social Psychology | volume = 65 | issue = 2| pages = 350–359 | doi=10.1037/0022-3514.65.2.350| citeseerx = 10.1.1.502.7301 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Social support can give a person coping resources that can reduce threat in a stressful situation. In a relationship if a partner has lower status or even lower power social undermining becomes more of threat for the relationship. Research concludes that social undermining has a greater impact on a person's mental health than social support.

Vinokur and van Ryn used unemployed participants and some of the participants were reemployed to look at the impact that social support and social undermining can have on a person's mental health during economic hardships.&lt;ref name="Vinokur, A. D. 1993" /&gt; They suggest that although the support and undermining are inversely and strongly correlated they do not form the same factor but constitute empirically distinct constructs. The study looked at the effect of financial strain, social support, and undermining on poor mental health the results found that it was not statistically significant. Social support and social undermining did have significant but the opposite effect on poor mental health. Vinokur and Ryn(1993)&lt;ref name="Vinokur, A. D. 1993"/&gt;  found that social support and undermining were shown in longitudinal design even when prior levels of mental health and the contribution of another critical stressful factor. Social support and undermining had a dynamic pattern influence on mental health.

The results showed that social support has weak positive effect while social undermining has more volatile effects. Even though the study found that a high level of social undermining has significant effects on mental health when the high levels are reduced there is an improvement in the person mental health over a period of time. In the study participants that received high levels of social undermining even after they return to their normal interactions the participant still returns to high level of undermining that affects the person mental health. These findings were found in relationships for men and women that were either unemployed or reemployed.&lt;ref name="Vinokur, A. D. 1993" /&gt;

Another example of how social undermining can affect a person's relationship is shown by a study conducted by McCaskill and Lakey&lt;ref name="McCaskill, J. W. 2000"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = McCaskill | first1 = J. W. | last2 = Lakey | first2 = B. | year = 2000 | title = Perceived support, social undermining, and emotion: Idiosyncratic and shared perspectives of adolescents and their families | url = | journal = Personality and Social Psychology Bulletin | volume = 26 | issue = 7| pages = 820–832 | doi=10.1177/0146167200269007}}&lt;/ref&gt; which examined social support and social undermining when it came to adolescents and family relationships. Social support and social undermining can reflect different characteristics in the environment that can influence a person's mental health. The study examined how adolescents reported their family support and undermining which reflected shared social reality (that is, all members of the family agree that support or undermining is occurring) and idiosyncratic perception (some family members believe that support or undermining has occurred, but others do not). The results of the study found that girls tend to report higher family stress and negative affect than boys. McCaskill and Lakey (2002)&lt;ref name="McCaskill, J. W. 2000"/&gt; found that adolescents with previous outpatient treatment experience reported both lower family support and higher family stress.

Researchers found that in adolescent self-reports, social undermining was related to negative affect and perceived support was more related to positive affect. The study found that adolescents' idiosyncratic perceptions of family support did predict positive emotion, but shared perceptions of support did not. For social undermining, adolescents' idiosyncratic perceptions, the idiosyncratic perceptions  of the other family members as well as shared social reality that was among family members did predict negative emotion. The study suggest that social support is not based on a shared reality, while social undermining is.&lt;ref name="McCaskill, J. W. 2000" /&gt;

Due to the differences in the scope of the effects of social undermining and social support, many researchers have concluded that they are separate constructs, rather than two ends of a continuum.&lt;ref name="Vinokur, A. D. 1993" /&gt;&lt;ref name="McCaskill, J. W. 2000" /&gt;

==Emotional and behavioral reactions==
Research has found that, depending on how the victim handles social undermining, it can have damaging effects when it comes to increased [[Counterproductive work behavior|counterproductive behaviors]], reciprocated social undermining, and decreased [[job satisfaction]].&lt;ref name="Crossley, C. D. 2009"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Crossley | first1 = C. D. | year = 2009 | title = Emotional and behavioral reactions to social undermining: A closer look at perceived offender motives | url = http://digitalcommons.unl.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1000&amp;context=managementfacpub| journal = Organizational Behavior and Human Decision Processes | volume = 108 | issue = 1| pages = 14–24 | doi=10.1016/j.obhdp.2008.06.001}}&lt;/ref&gt; These negative outcomes can cause the person to have depression, a decreased [[self-esteem]] and even [[psychosomatic]] symptoms.

In a study of victims' perceptions of undermining they had experienced, Crossley&lt;ref name="Crossley, C. D. 2009" /&gt; found that when an offense was severe, the victim was more likely to believe that the offender committed the action with malicious intent or due to personal greed. Generally, victims' perceptions of the offenders' intentions relate to whether the victim responds to the undermining in a negative fashion with feelings of anger and a desire for revenge, or in a positive fashion with a desire to reconcile with the offender.

[[Posttraumatic embitterment disorder|Post Traumatic Embitterment Disorder]] can be a reaction to this feeling of victimisation.

{{distinguish|Soliloquy}}
'''Somniloquy''' or '''sleep-talking''' is a [[parasomnia]] that refers to talking aloud while asleep. It can be quite loud, ranging from simple mumbling sounds to loud shouts and long, frequently inarticulate speeches, and can occur many times during a sleep cycle.&lt;ref name="WebMD"&gt;http://www.webmd.com/sleep-disorders/talking-in-your-sleep Talking in Your Sleep&lt;/ref&gt; As with [[sleepwalking]] and [[night terror]]s, sleeptalking usually occurs during delta-wave [[NREM|NREM sleep]] stages or during temporary arousals therefrom.

It can also occur during the [[Rapid eye movement sleep|REM]] sleep stage, at which time it represents what sleep therapists call a ''motor breakthrough'' (see [[sleep paralysis]]) of dream speech: words spoken in a dream are spoken out loud. Depending on its frequency, this may or may not be considered pathological. All motor functions are typically disabled during REM sleep thus, motoric, i.e., verbal elaboration of dream content, could be considered an REM behavior disorder (see below).

Sleep-talking can occur by itself or as a feature of another [[sleep disorder]] such as:
*[[Rapid eye movement behavior disorder]] (RBD) – loud, emotional or profane sleep talking
*[[Sleepwalking]]
*[[Night terror]]s – intense fear, screaming, shouting
*[[Nocturnal sleep-related eating disorder|Sleep-related eating disorder (SRED)]]

Sleep-talking is very common and is reported in 50% of young children, with most of them outgrowing it by puberty, although in rare cases it may persist into adulthood (about 4% of adults are reported to talk in their sleep). It appears to run in families.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Sleep Talking Psychology and Psychophysiology|last=Arkin|first=Arthur M.|publisher=L. Erlbaum Associates|year=1981|isbn=0-89859-031-0|pages=40–41}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1966, researchers worked to find links between [[heredity]] and somniloquy. Their research suggests the following:

*Sleep-talking parents are more likely to have children who sleep-talk
*Sleep talking can still occur, though much less commonly, when neither parent has a history of sleep talking
*A large portion of parents begin to sleep-talk later in life without any prior history of sleep-talking during childhood or adolescence

Sleep-talking by itself is typically harmless; however, it can wake others and cause them consternation&amp;mdash;especially when misinterpreted as conscious speech by an observer. If the sleep-talking is dramatic, emotional, or profane it may be a sign of another sleep disorder (see above). Sleep-talking can be monitored by a partner or by using an audio recording device; devices which remain idle until detecting a sound wave are ideal for this purpose. [[Polysomnography]] (sleep recording) shows episodes of sleep talking that can occur in any stage of sleep.&lt;ref name="WebMD"/&gt;

==In literature==
Sleep-talking appears in [[William Shakespeare|Shakespeare's]] [[Macbeth]], the famous [[sleepwalking scene]]. Lady Macbeth, in a "slumbery agitation," is observed by a gentlewoman and doctor to walk in her sleep and wash her hands, and utter the famous line, "Out, damned spot! out, I say!" (Act 5, Scene 1)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Shakespeare|first1=William|title=Macbeth|url=http://www.shakespeare-online.com/plays/macbeth_5_1.html|website=Shakespeare Online|publisher=Amanda Mabillard|accessdate=21 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sleep-talking also appears in ''The Childhood of King Erik Menved'', a 19th-century historical romance by Danish author [[Bernhard Severin Ingemann]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Ingemann|first1=Bernhard Severin|title=The Childhood of King Erik Menved: An Historical Romance|date=1846|publisher=Bruce and Wyld|location=London|page=11|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=t8svAAAAMAAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;source=gbs_ge_summary_r&amp;cad=0#v=onepage&amp;q=sleep&amp;f=false|accessdate=21 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the story, a young girl named Aasé has the prophetic power of speaking the truth in her sleep. In an 1846 English translation, Aasé is described thus:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
She is somewhat palefaced; and, however blithe and sprightly she may be, she is, nevertheless, now and then troubled with a kind of dreaming fit. But that will wear off as she gets older. Her mother was so troubled before her; and I believe it runs in the family as I am not entirely free from it myself. I do not give much heed to such dreaming now; but she has never yet said anything, while in this state, that has not proved in a manner true; though she can discern nothing, by night or day, more than others may do when they are in their senses.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
[[Walt Whitman]] wrote a now-lost novel based on Ingemann's romance, which he titled ''The Sleeptalker.''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=White|first1=William|title=Whitman's First "Literary" Letter|journal=American Literature|date=March 1963|volume=35|issue=1|pages=83–85|jstor=2923025}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Taman''' is an extinct [[Sino-Tibetan languages|Sino-Tibetan language]] that was spoken in [[Htamanthi]] village in [[Homalin Township]], [[Sagaing Region]], northern [[Myanmar]]. It was documented in a list of 75 words in Brown (1911). Keisuke Huziwara (2016)&lt;ref name="Huziwara2016"/&gt; discovered an elderly rememberer of Taman in Htamanthi who could remember some Taman phrases as well as a short song, but was not fluent in the Taman language. However, no fluent speakers of Taman remained in the area.

==Language shift==
Taman speakers have since shifted to [[Burmese language|Burmese]] and [[Tai Laing language|Tai Naing]] (Red Shan), a Tai language spoken in northern Myanmar.&lt;ref name="Huziwara2016"/&gt; Matisoff (2013:13)&lt;ref name="Matisoff2013"&gt;Matisoff, James A. 2013. [https://www.academia.edu/16300693/Re-examining_the_genetic_position_of_Jingpho_putting_flesh_on_the_bones_of_the_Jinghpho_Luish_Relationship Re-examining the genetic position of Jingpho: putting flesh on the bones of the Jingpho/Luish relationship]. ''Linguistics of the Tibeto-Burman Area'' 36(2). 1–106.&lt;/ref&gt; surmises that pressure from the formerly widespread [[Kadu language]] had caused Taman to become marginalized. The descendants of Taman speakers have since been assimilated into [[Shan people|Shan]] society.&lt;ref name="Huziwara2016"/&gt;

==Classification==
Benedict (1972) and Shafer (1974) had classified Taman as part of the [[Luish languages|Luish]] branch of languages.

Words and affixes shared exclusively between Luish and Taman are (Huziwara 2016):
*negative prefix (Proto-Luish *a-, Taman ʔə-)
*‘put’ (Proto-Luish *péy, Taman pe)
*‘go, walk’ (Proto-Luish *ha, Taman hɔ)
*‘sun’ as a compound word that includes ‘eye’

However, Huziwara (2016)&lt;ref name="Huziwara2016"/&gt; notes that despite Taman sharing some similarities with Luish, Taman cannot be securely classified within the Luish branch itself, and its place in Tibeto-Burman remains uncertain. Taman also shares various similarities with many nearby non-Luish languages, including various [[Sal languages]]. Huziwara (2016) concludes that Taman is part of a [[linkage (linguistics)|linkage]] of Tibeto-Burman languages spanning across northeast India and northern Myanmar (i.e., comparable to [[Scott DeLancey]]'s [[Central Tibeto-Burman languages]]), but does not recognizably fit into any known Tibeto-Burman branch.

==Phonology==
Taman has the following phonemes.&lt;ref name="Huziwara2016"/&gt;
*Vowels: a, e, ɛ, i, ɨ, ɐ, o [ɔ, ɑ], u, ə
*Consonants: p, ph, t, th, c [ts, tʃ], k, m, n, ŋ, r, l, s (sʰ), ʃ, x, h, w (v), y

==Sound changes==
Below are five innovations from [[Proto-Tibeto-Burman language|Proto-Tibeto-Burman]] (PTB) to Taman identified by Huziwara (2016).
*raising of low vowels ([[Proto-Tibeto-Burman language|PTB]] *-a &gt; Taman -ɔ)
*fricativization of velar stops in word-initial positions (PTB *k- &gt; Taman x-)
*loss of velar stops in word-final positions (PTB *-ak &gt; Taman -a)
*addition of velar stops after high vowels (PTB *-i/-u &gt; Taman -ek/-ouk)
*affrication of *gry- (PTB *gry- &gt; Taman c-)

==Lexicon==
Below is Brown's (1911) Taman word list as cited and re-transcribed in Huziwara (2016:19-29), and Brown's (1911) Taman list re-transcribed by Luce (1985), as cited and re-transcribed in Huziwara (2016).

The Taman word for 'river' is the same as the word for 'water'.

==Phrases and transcribed song==
On March 2, 2015, Keisuke Huziwara&lt;ref name="Huziwara2016"/&gt; discovered an 83-year-old woman in [[Htamanthi]] who remembered some words and phrases of the Taman language, as well as a short song. The woman was born in a village just outside Htamanthi. The elicited words and phrases are (Huziwara 2016:14-16):

*''hɔ əna, hɔ təyauŋ'' '(I) went over there.' (''hɔ'' 'to go')
*''kʰam sɔ-nə-kɔ'' 'Did (you) eat?' (''kʰam'' 'food, cooked rice'; ''sɔ'' 'to eat')
*''sɔ-kɛʔ'' 'already ate'
*''ʔə-sɔ-wɛʔ'' 'did not eat (yet)' (''ʔə''- 'negative prefix')
*''sɔ-nə-kɔ-ya'' 'ate; finished eating' (-''nə'' '[[desiderative mood|desiderative]] suffix')
*''tʰitum ŋɔ lɔ'' 'Where is the water?' (''tʰi'' 'water'; ''tum'' 'container'; ''ŋɔ'' 'where'; ''lɔ'' 'interrogative')
*''ʔəyɔ pe'' 'Where did I put it?' (''pe'' 'to place'; ''ʔəyɔ'' 'where?')
*''wa dɔ'' 'Come!' (''wa'' 'to come')
*''pi'' 'firewood' (cf. [[Meithei language|Meithei]] ''upi'' 'firewood')
*''məla'' 'tea'
*''məla sɔ nɔ'' 'Please drink tea.' (''məla'' 'tea'; ''sɔ'' 'to eat')

The song is transcribed as follows.
:ʔi ʔələyaŋ ʔi ʔələyaŋ
:nənum təhɔ ʔinahɔ
:məceiʔ cɔ he lɔcɔ ci
:məceiʔ cɔ ʔi na
:nam ha mina
:hɔ pi cɔ

Huziwara (2016:15-16) analyzes the song as follows.
*''ʔi ʔələyaŋ ʔi ʔələyaŋ'': exclamation introducing the song
*''nənum təhɔ ʔina hɔ'': 'The child went.'
*''məceiʔcɔ he'': 'Where is the child?' (Taman ''məceiʔcɔ'' 'child' &lt; [[Proto-Tibeto-Burman language|PTB]] *tsa-n)
*''lɔcɔ ci'': [meaning unclear]
*''məceiʔcɔ, ʔina'': 'I told the child'
*''nam ha mina'': 'Where did you go?'
*''hɔ pi cɔ'': 'I went outside.'

Altogether, the nouns, verbs, and prefixes elicited from Huziwara's (2016) Taman informant are:
*''kʰam'' 'food, cooked rice'
*''tʰi'' 'water'
*''məla'' 'tea'
*''pi'' 'firewood'
*''tum'' 'container'
*''məceiʔcɔ'' 'child'
*''ʔə''- 'negative prefix'
*''sɔ'' 'to eat'
*''hɔ'' 'to go'
*''wa'' 'to come'
*''pe'' 'to place, put'

'''Tarairiú''' {{sc|aka}} '''Caratiú''' is an [[extinct language|extinct]] and very poorly known language of eastern Brazil. The Tarairiu nation was divided into several tribes: the Jandoino, [[Kanindé]], Paiaku (Pajacú, Bajacú), Jenipapo, Jenipabuçu, Javó, Kamaçu, Tukuriju, Arariu, and "Xukuru" / Xacó.

The language is attested only through a few word lists. A few words resemble those of neighboring [[Kariri languages|Kariri]] (and other [[Macro-Je]]) and [[Xukuru languages|Xukuru]] languages, but not enough to support a genealogical connection. Kaufman (1994) reports that "not even [[Joseph Greenberg|Greenberg]] dares classify this language".

Some of the recorded words:

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="18412">In North American [[professional sports]], a '''trade''' is a [[sports league]] transaction between [[sports clubs]] that involves an exchange of [[Athlete|players]] from one club/team to another. Though players are the primary trading assets, [[draft pick]]s and/or [[cash]] are other assets that may be supplemented to consummate a trade, either packaged alongside players' contracts to be transferred to another team, or as standalone assets in exchange for players' contracts and/or draft picks in return. In [[Major League Baseball]], a [[player to be named later]] can be used to finalize the terms of a trade at a later date, but draft picks are not admissible as trading assets ([[Major_League_Baseball_transactions#Trades|with one exception]]). In [[Major League Soccer]], besides current MLS players and draft picks, clubs may also trade MLS rights to non-MLS players, [[allocation money]], [[2017_Major_League_Soccer_season#Allocation_ranking|allocation rankings]], and [[MLS International Roster Slots|international player slots]].&lt;ref&gt;https://www.mlssoccer.com/league/official-rules/mls-roster-rules-and-regulations&lt;/ref&gt; Typically, trades are completed between two clubs, but there are instances where trades are consummated among three or more clubs.

Conversely, a sports transaction involving a player who becomes a [[free agent]] and joins another club/team does not qualify as a trade as the player was not contractually bound to the previous team at the time of acquisition.

== No-trade clause ==&lt;!-- Several redirects ([[no trade clause]], [[no trade clauses]], etc. redirect here. If changing this section header, please use the "what links here" function and fix incoming redirects. Thanks!--&gt;
A '''no-trade clause''' is an amendment to a contract, usually relevant in American professional sports, wherein a player may not be traded to another club without the player's consent. Sometimes this clause is implemented by the club itself, but the vast majority are requested by the athlete and his [[sports agent]].  In many cases, these no-trade clauses are limited, where a club may be limited to trading the athlete only at certain times, or only to a certain team or geographical area.

No-trade clauses are found in most sports in North America, including [[Major League Baseball]], the [[National Football League]], the [[National Basketball Association]], the [[National Hockey League]], [[Major League Soccer]], and some minor leagues around the country.  Many [[Europe]]an leagues, mostly professional [[soccer]] and [[basketball]], also implement these contract amendments.

Each league usually has its own rules regarding these clauses; for example in the NBA, no-trade clauses can only be negotiated into contracts when a player has at least four years of service for the team he is signing the contract with and at least eight years total in the NBA.&lt;ref&gt;Larry Coon. [https://webfiles.uci.edu/lcoon/cbafaq/salarycap.htm#Q88 "NBA Salary Cap FAQ"]&lt;/ref&gt;  Other leagues have other varying rules, for example in MLB the "Ten and Five" rule gives mostly every player limited control on his tradability once he meets the ten and five criteria, which means the player has played in the league ten seasons and with the current team for at least five.  In the NHL, these rights have been blamed for the lack of trades that have been pulled off in recent years, with critics citing examples where "done deals" were blown up by "selfish players."&lt;ref name="vancouversun.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://vancouversun.com/sports/Dany+Heatley+Cheap+pathetic/1749503/story.html|title=Dany Heatley:Cheap and Pathetic|publisher=''[[The Vancouver Sun]]''|date=2009-07-01|accessdate=2009-07-10|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090705085531/http://www.vancouversun.com/Sports/Dany+Heatley+Cheap+pathetic/1749503/story.html|archivedate=2009-07-05|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Waiver of no-trade clause===
Often the no-trade clause is waived by the players themselves, usually in order to play for a contending team.

====MLB====

In one dramatic case in 2001, [[Tampa Bay Rays|Tampa Bay Devil Rays]] first baseman [[Fred McGriff]] mulled over waiving his rights for nearly a month before ultimately accepting a deal which sent him to the [[Chicago Cubs]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://static.espn.go.com/mlb/news/2001/0710/1224578.html "McGriff deal in 'holding pattern'"] [[espn.com]]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2017, [[Miami Marlins]] outfielder [[Giancarlo Stanton]] rejected trades both to the [[St. Louis Cardinals]] and [[San Francisco Giants]], saying that he would refuse to waive his no-trade clause for any teams other than the contenders [[Chicago Cubs]], hometown [[Los Angeles Dodgers]], up-and-coming [[New York Yankees]], and reigning [[2017 World Series]] champion [[Houston Astros]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://bleacherreport.com/articles/2748336-giancarlo-stanton-informs-cardinals-he-refuses-to-waive-no-trade-clause "Giancarlo Stanton Informs Cardinals, Giants He Won't Waive No-Trade Clause" [[bleacherreport.com]]&lt;/ref&gt; Stanton was eventually traded to the Yankees for [[Starlin Castro]], [[Jorge Guzman]], and [[José Devers]].&lt;ref&gt;https://www.mlb.com/news/yankees-acquire-giancarlo-stanton-from-marlins/c-263175874 "Got Giancarlo? Yanks go big: Stanton ovation!" [[mlb.com]]&lt;/ref&gt;

====NBA====

In 2007, [[Kobe Bryant]] was willing to waive his no trade clause with the [[Los Angeles Lakers]] in order to be dealt to either the [[Phoenix Suns]] or the [[Chicago Bulls]], but in this case, Kobe Bryant's own pickiness as far as where he would like to play limited the Lakers' ability to move him, and eventually no trade was made at all.&lt;ref&gt;Marc Stein. [http://sports.espn.go.com/nba/columns/story?columnist=stein_marc&amp;page=KobeTradeRequest-070530 "Kobe's trade request raises big questions. Here are some answers"] [[ESPN.com]] 2007-05-07&lt;/ref&gt;

====NHL====

[[Darryl Sittler]]'s no-trade clause protected him from being moved, when [[Toronto Maple Leafs]] owner [[Harold Ballard]] and manager [[Punch Imlach]] wanted to get rid of or reduce Sittler's influence on the team; a few years later Sittler waived the clause when relations between him and Ballard deteriorated. [[Dany Heatley]] demanded a trade from the [[Ottawa Senators]] at the end of the [[2008–09 NHL season|2008–09 season]]; a deal was in place to send Heatley to the [[Edmonton Oilers]] on June 30, but Heatley refused to waive his no-trade clause (the Oilers had missed the playoffs for 3 straight seasons), so he was traded to the [[San Jose Sharks]] instead.&lt;ref name="vancouversun.com" /&gt; [[Rick Nash]] demanded a trade from the [[Columbus Blue Jackets]] during the 2011–12 NHL season, but the deal could not be completed due to general manager [[Scott Howson]]'s high asking price from the teams to whom Nash would have permitted a trade. The holdout lasted into the summer of 2012, when he was traded to the [[New York Rangers]] for [[Brandon Dubinsky]], [[Tim Erixon]], [[Artem Anisimov]], and the Rangers first round pick in the [[2013 NHL Entry Draft|2013 draft]].

In an unusual case, [[Mats Sundin]] refused to waive his no-trade clause during the latter part of the  2007–08 season, even though his Maple Leafs were on track to miss the playoffs, and his contract was set to expire after the season concluded. Leafs management requested that Sundin waive his no-trade clause in order for the team to rebuild by acquiring potential young talent and/or draft picks, and Sundin was coveted by several teams looking to bolster their roster for the playoffs before the trade deadline. Sundin said he did not believe in being a "rental player" and that if he won the [[Stanley Cup]], he wanted to do it over the course of a whole season.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Maple Leafs captain Mats Sundin won't waive no-trade clause|url=http://www.iht.com/articles/ap/2008/02/25/sports/NA-SPT-HKY-NHL-Maple-Leafs-Sundin.php|accessdate=2008-12-20|date=2008-02-25|publisher=''[[International Herald Tribune]]''}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Trade deadline ==
A '''trade deadline''' (or '''trading deadline''') is a rule regulating the trading of professional players' contracts between clubs. In Major League Baseball and the National Hockey League, players acquired through trade after the trade deadline are ineligible for postseason play in that season, unless the respective league allows them to replace an injured player on the roster. In the National Football League, National Basketball Association and Major League Soccer, post-deadline trades are not allowed. This term is used mainly in [[North America]]. In the approach to the deadline, there is heightened activity and interest in trades.

The purpose of a trade deadline is to keep competitive balance towards the end of the season.

=== MLB ===
The [[Major League Baseball|Major League Baseball (MLB)]] non-waiver deadline was first instituted for the 1923 season, on June 23 of that year. It was moved to July 31 starting with the 1986 season.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=MLB trying to avoid conflict between trades, Sunday afternoon games|url=http://espn.go.com/mlb/story/_/id/14620922/major-league-baseball-moves-trade-deadline-back-1-day-august-1|accessdate=January 23, 2016|agency=Associated Press|publisher=ESPN.com|date=January 21, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Commissioner [[Rob Manfred]] moved it to August 1 for the 2016 season only, as July 31, 2016 is a Sunday.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Singer|first1=Tom|title=For this year only, Trade Deadline to be Aug. 1|url=http://m.braves.mlb.com/news/article/162485552/mlb-trade-deadline-to-be-aug-1-in-2016|accessdate=January 23, 2016|publisher=MLB.com|date=January 21, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; After the All-Star break, teams will determine whether or not they are in position to contend for the post-season. Because of [[Free agent|free agency]] and the lack of a [[salary cap]] in baseball, players in the final year of their [[contract]] are often put on the "trading block" by many of the non-playoff contending teams.  Smaller market teams will not — or cannot afford to — pay their better veteran players high salaries, so they will attempt to trade them to a post-season contender, in exchange for some minor-league prospects or other players who might be able to help them in the future.

The MLB [[Major League Baseball transactions#Waivers|waiver]] deadline is August 31.  There is much less activity between August 1 and August 31 because players must clear waivers. The waivers are revocable meaning that a team can revoke the claim of another team on their player.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://stlcardinals.scout.com/2/550487.html |title=Don’t Sweat the July 31 Trade "Deadline" |publisher=Stlcardinals.scout.com |date=2006-07-28 |accessdate=2012-02-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Players may be acquired after the August 31 deadline; however, while they can contribute to a team's push for the playoffs, they are ineligible for postseason play.

The trade deadline was instituted by MLB in response to various attempts by two [[New York City]]-based ballclubs, the [[History of the New York Giants (NL)|Giants]] and [[New York Yankees|Yankees]], to use their financial advantages to tilt their respective leagues' competitive balance in their favor from [[1917 Major League Baseball season|1917]] through [[1922 Major League Baseball season|1922]]. In the Yankees' case, most of its dealings were with the [[Boston Red Sox]]. The [[American League|American League (AL)]] established MLB's first-ever such rule in [[1920 Major League Baseball season|1920]] as an indirect result of the Red Sox's sale of [[Babe Ruth]] to the Yankees. It prohibited the trading and selling of ballplayers between August 1 and the conclusion of the [[World Series]]. A uniform rule serving both major leagues, which was adopted prior to the [[1923 Major League Baseball season|1923 season]], set the deadline at June 15. The date, chosen by MLB Commissioner [[Kenesaw Mountain Landis]] based on a suggestion from  [[Pittsburgh Pirates]] owner [[Barney Dreyfuss]], remained in effect through the [[1985 Major League Baseball season|1985 season]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/sports_blog/2011/07/did-babe-ruth-play-a-role-in-the-origin-of-the-mlb-trade-deadline.html |title=Cronin, Brian.

=== NBA ===
The [[National Basketball Association]]'s deadline falls on the 16th Thursday of the season (usually in mid-February) at 3pm [[Eastern Time Zone|Eastern Time]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nba.com/history/deadline_deals.html NBA Trading Deadline Trades Since 1987], NBA.com&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Roster Regulations"&gt;[http://www.nba.com/analysis/00421026.html Roster Regulations] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090409101619/http://www.nba.com/analysis/00421026.html |date=2009-04-09 }}, NBA.com&lt;/ref&gt; The deadline for the [[2011-12 NBA season|2011-12 season]] was on March 15, 2012 due to the [[2011-12 NBA lockout]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://espn.go.com/nba/story/_/id/7336131/nba-sets-march-15-trade-deadline-other-key-dates-sources-say/ |title=NBA sets March 15 trade deadline, other key dates, sources say - ESPN |publisher=Espn.go.com |date=2011-12-09 |accessdate=2012-02-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the NBA, post-deadline trades are forbidden, although teams are allowed to sign free agents and call up players from the G-League until the end of the regular season.&lt;ref name="Roster Regulations"/&gt;

=== NFL ===
The [[National Football League]]'s deadline is the Tuesday following the eighth week (formerly sixth) of the regular season.

Usually, there is fairly little activity on this day and almost no star players are ever dealt to other clubs on the sixth week of the season. The early deadline, along with players having to learn a whole new system on the fly, along with the salary cap often makes it difficult to make blockbuster trades on this day, unlike most other sports. Post deadline trades are not allowed.

===NHL===
The [[National Hockey League]]'s trade deadline is calculated as the 40th day before the final day of the Regular Season, ensuring that it typically falls during the last week of February or the first week of March. Much like Major League Baseball and the National Basketball Association, the NHL's trade deadline is often a period of increased player movement; teams that are either making a final push to secure a playoff spot or hoping to go deep into the playoffs attempt to trade to acquire key veterans or proven scorers in order to solidify their rosters. Conversely, teams that are rebuilding with younger players may be willing to trade away their more expensive players in order to "dump" (reduce) salary and get draft picks/prospects in return. Players on playoff-contending teams who are injured and not expected to return for the current season may be offered to teams that are rebuilding, since they will be of no value to a team's playoff prospects in the current season but may be of value to another team for (a) future season(s). Also, players who are about to become unrestricted [[free agent]]s and have indicated that they do not intend to return to their current teams may be traded away so that those teams will get something in return, instead of seeing such players sign with another team while their former teams receive nothing.

The NHL trade deadline also generates a great deal of talk among hockey fans and analysts, with much speculation and discussion about which players will get traded and where they will go. In [[Canada]], the NHL trade deadline is treated with such significance that the two major sports networks [[The Sports Network|TSN]] and [[Sportsnet]] devote much of the day to speculation and coverage of trades.

=== Association football ===
{{Main|Transfer window}}
[[Association football]] clubs have two [[transfer (association football)|transfer]] windows per season. In most countries, one falls during the middle of the season and the other runs during the period between seasons, generally called the "close season" in Europe and "off-season" in North America.  For those countries with seasons starting in August/September such as most European countries, the midseason transfer window usually falls in January, and the other one opens from June to September. In countries with seasons that operate entirely within a calendar year, like many leagues in [[Latin America]] or [[Northern Europe]], as well as North America's [[Major League Soccer]], the midseason transfer window opens in July/August, while the other starts from March to April. The difference between a transfer window and a trade deadline is that players cannot be bought or sold outside these transfer window periods. The notion of transfer windows was initially introduced in [[Europe]], and subsequently adopted by [[FIFA]]. Like North America's trade deadline, there is greatly increased activity and interest as the close of a transfer window draws near.

==== MLS ====
In Major League Soccer, trades between MLS teams that involve players and player transfers from outside MLS must occur during either the primary transfer window (typically February - May) or secondary transfer window (July - August).

MLS roster freeze date falls on September 15, at which time teams must submit their final roster that cannot be changed through the day after MLS Cup.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.mlssoccer.com/league/official-rules/mls-roster-rules-and-regulations&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Web design''' encompasses many different skills and disciplines in the production and maintenance of websites. The different areas of web design include web graphic design; [[interface design]]; authoring, including standardised code and [[proprietary software]]; [[user experience design]]; and [[search engine optimization]]. Often many individuals will work in teams covering different aspects of the design process, although some designers will cover them all.&lt;ref name="different jobs" &gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt; The term web design is normally used to describe the design process relating to the front-end (client side) design of a website including writing mark up. Web design partially overlaps [[web engineering]] in the broader scope of [[web development]]. Web designers are expected to have an awareness of [[Web usability|usability]] and if their role involves creating mark up then they are also expected to be up to date with [[web accessibility]] guidelines.

==History==
[[File:WebDesignBooks.JPG|thumb|Web design books in a store]]

===1988–2001===
Although web design has a fairly recent history, it can be linked to other areas such as graphic design. However, web design can also be seen from a technological standpoint. It has become a large part of people’s everyday lives. It is hard to imagine the Internet without animated graphics, different styles of typography, background, and music.

====The start of the web and web design====
In 1989, whilst working at [[CERN]] [[Tim Berners-Lee]] proposed to create a global hypertext project, which later became known as the [[World Wide Web]]. During 1991 to 1993 the World Wide Web was born. Text-only pages could be viewed using a simple line-mode browser.&lt;ref name="World Wide Web" &gt;{{cite web
  |title=Longer Biography
  |url=http://www.w3.org/People/Berners-Lee/Longer.html
  |accessdate=2012-03-16
}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1993 [[Marc Andreessen]] and [[Eric Bina]], created the [[Mosaic browser]]. At the time there were multiple browsers, however the majority of them were Unix-based and naturally text heavy. There had been no integrated approach to graphic design elements such as images or sounds. The Mosaic browser broke this mould.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web
  |title=Mosaic Browser
  |url=http://www.techopedia.com/images/pdfs/history-of-the-internet.pdf
  |accessdate=2012-03-16
}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The [[W3C]] was created in October 1994 to "lead the World Wide Web to its full potential by developing common protocols that promote its evolution and ensure its interoperability."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

  |isbn=1-56592-871-7
  |page=804
}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This discouraged any one company from monopolizing a propriety browser and programming language, which could have altered the effect of the World Wide Web as a whole. The W3C continues to set standards, which can today be seen with JavaScript. In 1994 Andreessen formed Communications Corp. that later became known as [[Netscape Communications]], the Netscape 0.9 browser. Netscape created its own HTML tags without regard to the traditional standards process. For example, Netscape 1.1 included tags for changing background colours and formatting text with tables on web pages. Throughout 1996 to 1999 the [[browser wars]] began, as [[Microsoft]] and [[Netscape]] fought for ultimate browser dominance. During this time there were many new technologies in the field, notably [[Cascading Style Sheets]], [[JavaScript]], and [[Dynamic HTML]]. On the whole, the browser competition did lead to many positive creations and helped web design evolve at a rapid pace.&lt;ref name=Browsers &gt;{{cite book

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Evolution of web design ====
In 1996, Microsoft released its first competitive browser, which was complete with its own features and tags. It was also the first browser to support style sheets, which at the time was seen as an obscure authoring technique.&lt;ref name=Browsers/&gt;  The [[HTML markup]] for [[HTML element#Tables|tables]] was originally intended for displaying tabular data. However designers quickly realized the potential of using HTML tables for creating the complex, multi-column layouts that were otherwise not possible. At this time, as design and good aesthetics seemed to take precedence over good mark-up structure, and little attention was paid to semantics and [[web accessibility]]. HTML sites were limited in their design options, even more so with earlier versions of HTML. To create complex designs, many web designers had to use complicated table structures or even use blank [[spacer .GIF]] images to stop empty table cells from collapsing.&lt;ref name="Chapman, Evolution" &gt;{{citation |last=Chapman  |first=Cameron  |title=The Evolution of Web Design  |url=http://sixrevisions.com/web_design/the-evolution-of-web-design/|publisher=Six Revisions|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131030030802/http://sixrevisions.com/web_design/the-evolution-of-web-design/ |archivedate=30 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[CSS]] was introduced in December 1996 by the [[W3C]] to support presentation and layout. This allowed [[HTML]] code to be semantic rather than both semantic and presentational, and improved web accessibility, see [[tableless web design]].

In 1996, [[Adobe Flash|Flash]] (originally known as FutureSplash) was developed. At the time, the Flash content development tool was relatively simple compared to now, using basic layout and drawing tools, a limited precursor to [[ActionScript]], and a timeline, but it enabled web designers to go beyond the point of HTML, [[Graphics Interchange Format#Animated GIF|animated GIFs]] and [[JavaScript]]. However, because Flash required a [[Plug-in (computing)|plug-in]], many web developers avoided using it for fear of limiting their market share due to lack of compatibility. Instead, designers reverted to gif animations (if they didn't forego using [[motion graphics]] altogether) and JavaScript for [[software widget|widgets]]. But the benefits of Flash made it popular enough among specific target markets to eventually work its way to the vast majority of browsers, and powerful enough to be used to develop entire sites.&lt;ref name="Chapman, Evolution" /&gt;

====End of the first browser wars====
During 1998 Netscape released Netscape Communicator code under an [[Open-source license|open source licence]], enabling thousands of developers to participate in improving the software. However, they decided to start from the beginning, which guided the development of the open source browser and soon expanded to a complete application platform.&lt;ref name="Browsers"/&gt;  The [[Web Standards Project]] was formed and promoted browser compliance with [[Comparison of layout engines (HTML)|HTML]] and [[Comparison of layout engines (Cascading Style Sheets)|CSS]] standards by creating [[Acid1]], [[Acid2]], and [[Acid3]] tests. 2000 was a big year for Microsoft. Internet Explorer was released for Mac; this was significant as it was the first browser that fully supported HTML 4.01 and CSS 1, raising the bar in terms of standards compliance. It was also the first browser to fully support the [[Portable Network Graphics|PNG]] image format.&lt;ref name="Browsers"/&gt;  During this time Netscape was sold to [[AOL]] and this was seen as Netscape’s official loss to Microsoft in the browser wars.&lt;ref name="Browsers"/&gt;

===2001–2012===
Since the start of the 21st century the web has become more and more integrated into peoples lives. As this has happened the technology of the web has also moved on. There have also been significant changes in the way people use and access the web, and this has changed how sites are designed.

Since the end of the [[Browser wars|browsers wars]]{{when|date=May 2016}} new browsers have been released. Many of these are [[open-source software|open source]] meaning that they tend to have faster development and are more supportive of new standards. The new options are considered by many{{Weasel inline|date=May 2016}} to be better than Microsoft's [[Internet Explorer]].

The [[World Wide Web Consortium|W3C]] has released new standards for HTML ([[HTML5]]) and CSS ([[CSS3]]), as well as new [[JavaScript]] [[Application programming interface|API's]], each as a new but individual standard.{{when|date=May 2016}} While the term HTML5 is only used to refer to the new version of HTML and ''some'' of the JavaScript API's, it has become common to use it to refer to the entire suite of new standards (HTML5, CSS3 and JavaScript).

== Tools and technologies ==
Web designers use a variety of different tools depending on what part of the production process they are involved in. These tools are updated over time by newer standards and software but the principles behind them remain the same. Web designers use both [[Vector graphics editor|vector]] and [[Raster graphics editor|raster]] graphics editors to create web-formatted imagery or design prototypes. Technologies used to create websites include W3C standards like HTML and CSS, which can be hand-coded or generated by [[Website builder|WYSIWYG editing software]]. Other tools web designers might use include mark up [[HTML validator|validators]]&lt;ref name="W3C_validator"&gt;{{cite web|title=W3C Markup Validation Service|url=http://validator.w3.org/}}&lt;/ref&gt; and other testing tools for usability and accessibility to ensure their websites meet web accessibility guidelines.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=W3C|title=Web Accessibility Initiative (WAI)|url=http://www.w3.org/WAI/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Skills and techniques ==

=== Marketing and communication design ===
Marketing and communication design on a website may identify what works for its target market. This can be an age group or particular strand of culture; thus the designer may understand the trends of its audience. Designers may also understand the type of website they are designing, meaning, for example, that (B2B) [[business-to-business]] website design considerations might differ greatly from a consumer targeted website such as a [[retail]] or entertainment website. Careful consideration might be made to ensure that the aesthetics or overall design of a site do not clash with the clarity and accuracy of the content or the ease of [[web navigation]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=THORLACIUS|first=LISBETH|title=The Role of Aesthetics in Web Design|journal=Nordicom Review|year=2007|issue=28|pages=63–76|url=http://www.nordicom.gu.se/en/tidskrifter/nordicom-review-12007/role-aesthetics-web-design|accessdate=2014-07-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; especially on a B2B website. Designers may also consider the reputation of the owner or business the site is representing to make sure they are portrayed favourably.

=== User experience design and interactive design ===
User understanding of the content of a website often depends on user understanding of how the website works. This is part of the [[user experience design]]. User experience is related to layout, clear instructions and labeling on a website. How well a user understands how they can interact on a site may also depend on the [[interactive design]] of the site. If a user perceives the usefulness of the website, they are more likely to continue using it. Users who are skilled and well versed with website use may find a more distinctive, yet less intuitive or less [[usability|user-friendly]] website interface useful nonetheless. However, users with less experience are less likely to see the advantages or usefulness of a less intuitive website interface. This drives the trend for a more universal user experience and ease of access to accommodate as many users as possible regardless of user skill.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Castañeda|first=J.A Francisco |last2=Muñoz-Leiva|first2=Teodoro Luque|title=Web Acceptance Model (WAM): Moderating effects of user experience|journal=Information &amp; Management |year=2007 |volume=44 |pages=384–396|doi=10.1016/j.im.2007.02.003}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Much of the user experience design and interactive design are considered in the [[user interface design]].

Advanced interactive functions may require [[plug-in (computing)|plug-ins]] if not advanced coding language skills. Choosing whether or not to use interactivity that requires plug-ins is a critical decision in user experience design. If the plug-in doesn't come pre-installed with most browsers, there's a risk that the user will have neither the know how or the patience to install a plug-in just to access the content. If the function requires advanced coding language skills, it may be too costly in either time or money to code compared to the amount of enhancement the function will add to the user experience. There's also a risk that advanced interactivity may be incompatible with older browsers or hardware configurations. Publishing a function that doesn't work reliably is potentially worse for the user experience than making no attempt. It depends on the target audience if it's likely to be needed or worth any risks.

=== Page layout ===
Part of the user interface design is affected by the quality of the [[page layout]].  For example, a designer may consider whether the site's page layout should remain consistent on different pages when designing the layout.  Page pixel width may also be considered vital for aligning objects in the layout design. The most popular fixed-width websites generally have the same set width to match the current most popular browser window, at the current most popular screen resolution, on the current most popular monitor size. Most pages are also center-aligned for concerns of [[aesthetics]] on larger screens.

'''Fluid layouts''' increased in popularity around 2000 as an alternative to HTML-table-based layouts and [[Grid (page layout)|grid-based design]] in both page layout design principle and in coding technique, but were very slow to be adopted.&lt;ref group="note" &gt;&lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;table&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;-based markup and [[spacer .GIF]] images&lt;/ref&gt; This was due to considerations of [[Screen reader|screen reading devices]] and varying windows sizes which designers have no control over. Accordingly, a design may be broken down into units (sidebars, content blocks, [[Web banner|embedded advertising]] areas, navigation areas) that are sent to the browser and which will be fitted into the display window by the browser, as best it can. As the browser does recognize the details of the reader's screen (window size, font size relative to window etc.) the browser can make user-specific layout adjustments to fluid layouts, but not fixed-width layouts. Although such a display may often change the relative position of major content units, sidebars may be displaced below [[body text]] rather than to the side of it. This is a more flexible display than a hard-coded grid-based layout that doesn't fit the device window. In particular, the relative position of content blocks may change while leaving the content within the block unaffected. This also minimizes the user's need to horizontally scroll the page.

[[Responsive Web Design]] is a newer approach, based on CSS3, and a deeper level of per-device specification within the page's stylesheet through an enhanced use of the CSS &lt;code&gt;@media&lt;/code&gt; rule. In March 2018 Google announced they would be rolling out mobile-first indexing.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://webmasters.googleblog.com/2018/03/rolling-out-mobile-first-indexing.html|title=Rolling out mobile-first indexing|work=Official Google Webmaster Central Blog|access-date=2018-06-09|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;Sites using responsive design are well placed to ensure they meet this new approach.

===Typography===
Web designers may choose to limit the variety of website typefaces to only a few which are of a similar style, instead of using a wide range of [[typeface]]s or [[Typeface#Style of typefaces|type styles]]. Most browsers recognize a specific number of safe fonts, which designers mainly use in order to avoid complications.

Font downloading was later included in the CSS3 fonts module and has since been implemented in Safari 3.1, Opera 10 and Mozilla Firefox 3.5. This has subsequently increased interest in [[web typography]], as well as the usage of font downloading.

Most site layouts incorporate negative space to break the text up into paragraphs and also avoid center-aligned text.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Stone|first=John|title=20 Do’s and Don’ts of Effective Web Typography| url=http://webdesignledger.com/tips/20-dos-and-donts-of-effective-web-typography|accessdate=2012-03-19|date=2009-11-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Motion graphics===
The page layout and user interface may also be affected by the use of motion graphics. The choice of whether or not to use motion graphics may depend on the target market for the website. Motion graphics may be expected or at least better received with an entertainment-oriented website. However, a website target audience with a more serious or formal interest (such as business, community, or government) might find animations unnecessary and distracting if only for entertainment or decoration purposes. This doesn't mean that more serious content couldn't be enhanced with animated or video presentations that is relevant to the content. In either case, [[motion graphic design]] may make the difference between more effective visuals or distracting visuals.

Motion graphics that are not initiated by the site visitor can produce accessibility issues. The World Wide Web consortium accessibility standards require that site visitors be able to disable the animations.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.w3.org/TR/UNDERSTANDING-WCAG20/time-limits-pause.html World Wide Web Consortium: Understanding Web Content Accessibility Guidelines 2.2.2: Pause, Stop, Hide]&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Quality of code ===
Website designers may consider it to be good practice to conform to standards. This is usually done via a description specifying what the element is doing. Failure to conform to standards may not make a website unusable or error prone, but standards can relate to the correct layout of pages for readability as well making sure coded elements are closed appropriately. This includes errors in code, more organized layout for code, and making sure IDs and classes are identified properly. Poorly-coded pages are sometimes colloquially called [[tag soup]]. [[W3C Markup Validation Service|Validating via W3C]]&lt;ref name="W3C_validator" /&gt; can only be done when a correct DOCTYPE declaration is made, which is used to highlight errors in code. The system identifies the errors and areas that do not conform to web design standards. This information can then be corrected by the user.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=W3C QA|title=My Web site is standard! And yours?| url=http://www.w3.org/QA/2002/04/Web-Quality|accessdate=2012-03-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Generated content ===
There are two ways websites are generated: statically or dynamically.

==== Static websites ====
{{Main|Static web page}}
A static website stores a unique file for every page of a static website. Each time that page is requested, the same content is returned. This content is created once, during the design of the website. It is usually manually authored, although some sites use an automated creation process, similar to a dynamic website, whose results are stored long-term as completed pages. These automatically-created static sites became more popular around 2015, with generators such as [[Jekyll (software)|Jekyll]] and [[Adobe Muse]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web

  | url = https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2015/11/static-website-generators-jekyll-middleman-roots-hugo-review/
}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The benefits of a static website are that they were simpler to host, as their server only needed to serve static content, not execute server-side scripts. This required less server administration and had less chance of exposing security holes. They could also serve pages more quickly, on low-cost server hardware. These advantage became less important as cheap web hosting expanded to also offer dynamic features, and [[virtual machine|virtual server]]s offered high performance for short intervals at low cost.

Almost all websites have some static content, as supporting assets such as images and stylesheets are usually static, even on a website with highly dynamic pages.

==== Dynamic websites ====
{{Main|Dynamic web page}}
Dynamic websites are generated on the fly and use server-side technology to generate webpages. They typically extract their content from one or more back-end databases: some are database queries across a relational database to query a catalogue or to summarise numeric information, others may use a [[document database]] such as [[MongoDB]] or [[NoSQL]] to store larger units of content, such as blog posts or wiki articles.

In the design process, dynamic pages are often mocked-up or [[website wireframe|wireframe]]d using static pages. The skillset needed to develop dynamic web pages is much broader than for a static pages, involving server-side and database coding as well as client-side interface design. Even medium-sized dynamic projects are thus almost always a team effort.

When dynamic web pages first developed, they were typically coded directly in languages such as [[Perl]], [[PHP]] or [[Active Server Pages|ASP]]. Some of these, notably PHP and ASP, used a 'template' approach where a server-side page resembled the structure of the completed client-side page and data was inserted into places defined by 'tags'. This was a quicker means of development than coding in a purely procedural coding language such as Perl.

Both of these approaches have now been supplanted for many websites by higher-level application-focused tools such as [[content management system]]s.  These build on top of general purpose coding platforms and assume that a website exists to offer content according to one of several well recognised models, such as a time-sequenced [[blog]], a thematic magazine or news site, a wiki or a user forum. These tools make the implementation of such a site very easy, and a purely organisational and design-based task, without requiring any coding.

Editing the content itself (as well as the template page) can be done both by means of the site itself, and with the use of third-party software. The ability to edit all pages is provided only to a specific category of users (for example, administrators, or registered users). In some cases, anonymous users are allowed to edit certain web content, which is less frequent (for example, on forums - adding messages).

Usability experts, including [[Jakob Nielsen (usability consultant)|Jakob Nielsen]] and Kyle Soucy, have often emphasised homepage design for website success and asserted that the homepage is the most important page on a website.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=http://www.usableinterface.com/articles/homepage.php|first=Kyle|last=Soucy|archivedate=8 June 2012|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120608071219/http://www.usableinterface.com/articles/homepage.php |title=Is Your Homepage Doing What It Should?|publisher=Usable Interface}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|Nielsen|Tahir|2001}}&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=http://www.nngroup.com/articles/most-violated-homepage-guidelines/|title=The Ten Most Violated Homepage Design Guidelines|date=10 November 2003|first=Jakob|last=Nielsen|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131005150112/http://www.nngroup.com/articles/most-violated-homepage-guidelines/ |archivedate=5 October 2013|publisher=Nielsen Norman Group}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=http://sixrevisions.com/web_design/essential-tips-for-designing-an-effective-homepage/|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130821151637/http://sixrevisions.com/web_design/essential-tips-for-designing-an-effective-homepage/ |archivedate=21 August 2013|date=20 August 2009|first=Kayla|last=Knight|publisher=Six Revisions|title=Essential Tips for Designing an Effective Homepage}}&lt;/ref&gt; However practitioners into the 2000s were starting to find that a growing number of website traffic was bypassing the homepage, going directly to internal content pages through search engines, e-newsletters and RSS feeds.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=http://www.uie.com/brainsparks/2005/09/29/is-home-page-design-relevant-anymore/|publisher=User Interface Engineering|first=Jared|last=Spool|date=29 September 2005|archivedate=16 September 2013|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130916092857/http://www.uie.com/brainsparks/2005/09/29/is-home-page-design-relevant-anymore/ |title=Is Home Page Design Relevant Anymore?}}&lt;/ref&gt; Leading many practitioners to argue that homepages are less important than most people think.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=10 Usability Tips Based on Research Studies|url=http://sixrevisions.com/usabilityaccessibility/10-usability-tips-based-on-research-studies/|first=Cameron|last=Chapman|date=15 September 2010|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130902031226/http://sixrevisions.com/usabilityaccessibility/10-usability-tips-based-on-research-studies/ |archivedate=2 September 2013|publisher=Six Revisions}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=http://uxmyths.com/post/717779908/myth-the-homepage-is-your-most-important-page|title=Myth #17: The homepage is your most important page|first=Zoltán|last=Gócza|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130602172028/http://uxmyths.com/post/717779908/myth-the-homepage-is-your-most-important-page |archivedate=2 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=http://giraffeforum.com/wordpress/2010/04/18/the-decline-of-the-homepage/|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130524221238/http://giraffeforum.com/wordpress/2010/04/18/the-decline-of-the-homepage/ |archivedate=24 May 2013|title=The decline of the homepage|first=Gerry|last=McGovern|date=18 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=Prioritizing Design Time: A Long Tail Approach|first=Joshua|last=Porter|date=24 April 2006|publisher=User Interface Engineering|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130514075119/http://www.uie.com/articles/prioritizing_design_time/ |archivedate=14 May 2013|url=http://www.uie.com/articles/prioritizing_design_time/}}&lt;/ref&gt; Jared Spool argued in 2007 that a site's homepage was actually the least important page on a website.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=http://www.uie.com/brainsparks/2007/08/06/usability-tools-podcast-home-page-design/|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130429113949/http://www.uie.com/brainsparks/2007/08/06/usability-tools-podcast-home-page-design/ |archivedate=29 April 2013|first=Jared|last=Spool|date=6 August 2007|title=Usability Tools Podcast: Home Page Design}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2012 and 2013, carousels (also called 'sliders' and 'rotating banners') have become an extremely popular design element on homepages, often used to showcase featured or recent content in a confined space.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=Best practices in carousel design for effective web marketing|first=Chris|last=Bates|date=9 October 2012|publisher=Smart Insights|url=http://www.smartinsights.com/conversion-optimisation/home-page-optimisation/carousels-design-best-practice/|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130403013507/http://www.smartinsights.com/conversion-optimisation/home-page-optimisation/carousels-design-best-practice/ |archivedate=3 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Messner2013&gt;{{citation|url=http://www.usability.gov/get-involved/blog/2013/04/image-carousels.html |title=Image Carousels: Getting Control of the Merry-Go-Round|first=Katie|last=Messner|publisher=Usability.gov|date=22 April 2013|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131010094459/http://www.usability.gov/get-involved/blog/2013/04/image-carousels.html |archivedate=10 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many practitioners argue that carousels are an ineffective design element and hurt a website's search engine optimisation and usability.&lt;ref name=Messner2013/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=http://searchengineland.com/homepage-sliders-are-bad-for-seo-usability-163496|archivedate=22 November 2013|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131122031942/http://searchengineland.com/homepage-sliders-are-bad-for-seo-usability-163496 |title=Homepage Sliders: Bad For SEO, Bad For Usability|first=Harrison|last=Jones|date=19 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=http://conversionxl.com/dont-use-automatic-image-sliders-or-carousels-ignore-the-fad/|title=Don’t Use Automatic Image Sliders or Carousels, Ignore the Fad|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131125013642/http://conversionxl.com/dont-use-automatic-image-sliders-or-carousels-ignore-the-fad/ |archivedate=25 November 2013|first=Peep|last=Laja|date=27 September 2012|publisher=ConversionXL}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Occupations ==
There are two primary jobs involved in creating a website: the web designer and [[web developer]], who often work closely together on a website.&lt;ref name ="careersinwebdesign"&gt;{{cite book|last=Oleksy|first=Walter|title=Careers in Web Design| year=2001|publisher=The Rosen Publishing Group, Inc.|location=New York|isbn=9780823931910 |pages=9–11|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=-OJSA5wS7kQC&amp;pg=PA9}}&lt;/ref&gt; The web designers are responsible for the visual aspect, which includes the layout, coloring and typography of a web page. Web designers will also have a working knowledge of [[markup language]]s such as HTML and CSS, although the extent of their knowledge will differ from one web designer to another.  Particularly in smaller organizations one person will need the necessary skills for designing and programming the full web page, while larger organizations may have a web designer responsible for the visual aspect alone.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Web Designer|url=http://www.myjobsearch.com/careers/web-designer.html|accessdate=2012-03-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;


Further jobs which may become involved in the creation of a website include:  
*[[Graphic designers]] to create visuals for the site such as logos, layouts and buttons
*Internet marketing specialists to help maintain web presence through strategic solutions on targeting viewers to the site, by using marketing and promotional techniques on the internet
*SEO writers to research and recommend the correct words to be incorporated into a particular website and make the website more accessible and found on numerous search engines
*Internet copywriter to create the written content of the page to appeal to the targeted viewers of the site&lt;ref name="different jobs" /&gt;
*User experience [[User experience design|(UX) designer]] incorporates aspects of user focused design considerations which include information architecture, user centered design, user testing, interaction design, and occasionally visual design.

}}'''Yvan Sagnet''' (born '''Jean Pierre Yvan Sagnet''', 1985) is a Cameroonian activist and [[non-fiction]] writer,  known for founding the charity No Cap and his work against the exploitation of workers in the Italian agricultural industry. 
== Biography ==
Sagnet was born in [[Douala]], Cameroon.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.repubblica.it/spettacoli-e-cultura/2012/10/17/news/saviano_ragazzo_africano-44685428/|title=L'eroe qualunque, il ragazzo africano che si è ribellato ai "caporali" del Sud - Repubblica.it|work=La Repubblica|access-date=2018-11-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/qv9xwm/how-a-young-cameroonian-sparked-a-revolt-against-migrant-exploitation-in-italy-v25n3|title=How a Young Cameroonian Sparked a Revolt Against Migrant Exploitation in Italy|date=2018-11-01|work=Vice|access-date=2018-11-27|language=en-us}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sagnet arrived in Italy in 2007 to attend the [[Polytechnic University of Turin]] to study engineering&lt;ref name="equaltimes1"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.equaltimes.org/red-gold-and-blood-money-the-fight|title=Red gold and blood money: the fight to end modern slavery in Italy's agricultural sector|website=Equal Times|language=en|access-date=2018-11-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; through receiving a scholarship, . When he failed an exam&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.thelocal.it/20170120/the-student-who-lifted-the-lid-on-italys-modern-slavery|title=The student who lifted the lid on modern slavery in Italy|date=2017-01-20|access-date=2018-11-27|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; and  lost his scholarship at the end of July 2011,&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;  he traveled to [[Salento, Campania|Salento]], [[Nardò]] in [[Southern Italy]].  He started working at Masseria Boncuri, a local farm, as a tomato picker. There, Sagnet organized a protest against the inhumane working conditions on the farm that successfully lead to reforms to the regulations for working conditions in the agricultural industry.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; 

After the uprising, Sagnet continued his activism through working as an advocate for [[Italian General Confederation of Labour|CGIL]] and finished his degree in engineering.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref name="totaro1"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-italy-migrants-slavery/calls-mount-to-stop-abuse-of-migrant-workers-in-italys-red-gold-the-tomato-sector-idUSKCN0WV13U|title=Calls mount to stop abuse of migrant workers in Italy's 'red gold':...|last=Totaro|first=Paola|work=U.S.|access-date=2018-11-27|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

In 2015, Sagnet published a book about the exploitation of workers in the Italian agricultural industry with [[Fandango Libri]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.brindisireport.it/eventi/ghetto-italia-l-inchiesta-di-palmisano-e-sagnet-sullo-sfruttamento-dei-lavoratori-presentata-al-liceo-a-calamo.html|title=“Ghetto Italia”, l’inchiesta di Palmisano e Sagnet sullo sfruttamento dei lavoratori presentata al liceo “A.Calamo”|work=BrindisiReport|access-date=2018-11-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; His second book, about his own experience at Masseria Boncuri, followed with [[Galleria Fandango]] in 2017.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.stranieriincampania.it/wp/libri-ama-il-tuo-sogno-vita-e-rivolta-nella-terra-delloro-rosso-di-yvan-sagnet/|title=Libri – “Ama il tuo sogno.

In February 2017, Sagnet was knighted Cavaliere dell'Ordine al Merito della Repubblica Italiana by Italian president [[Sergio Mattarella]] for his work to end modern-day slavery in the Italian agricultural industry.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.lagazzettameridionale.com/2017/02/caporalato-al-quirinale-yvan-sagnet.html|title=Caporalato.

== Nardò Uprising and Aftermath ==
While working at the Massaria Boncuri, Sagnet discovered the [[caporalato]], a system revolving around the caporali, who illegally recruit tomato workers in a gang-like manner that Sagnet describes as comparable to "modern-day slavery"&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; in the Italian agricultural industry. The workers worked 16-hour days for wages of 20-25 euros, with the caporali taking a huge cut of the profits. Sagnet describes situations in which the caporali charged workers several days worth of wages for driving them to the hospital when they passed out due to exhaustion.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.ilquaderno.it/no-cap-filiera-etica-all-;unisannio-testimonianza-yvan-sagnet-125928.html|title=No Cap e filiera etica: all'Unisannio la testimonianza di Yvan Sagnet|work=il Quaderno|access-date=2018-11-27|language=it}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

On the morning 30th July 2011,&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://libcom.org/library/tomato-harvest-nardo-apulia-first-self-organised-strike-day-labourers|title=Tomato harvest in Nardo, Apulia: The first self organised strike of the day labourers|website=libcom.org|language=en|access-date=2018-11-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; after only working on the fields for five days,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2017/oct/24/the-terrible-truth-about-your-tin-of-italian-tomatoes|title=The terrible truth about your tin of Italian tomatoes|last=Hunter|first=Isabel|last2=Pietro|first2=Lorenzo Di|date=2017-10-24|website=the Guardian|language=en|access-date=2018-11-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sagnet persuaded his fellow workers to start a strike after their employers issued an increase in workload without an increase in pay.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; The workers protested for two weeks, erecting a street block. The protest encompassed 350 workers from Masseria Boncuri.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; When faced with the issue of not being paid and starvation during their strike, he reached out to the general public for help with food donations, and the strike eventually led to local farmers agreeing to formal contracts for their workers and politicians approving an anti-gang master law, forbidding the caporali from undercutting wages by law one week after the strike had ended, in September 2011.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

In the same year, the Anti-Mafia District Attorney Office of Lecce started an investigation of the matter of the caporalato, requesting 22 arrests.&lt;ref name="equaltimes1"/&gt; 16 caporali were ultimately arrested.&lt;ref name="totaro1"/&gt; Sagnet was a key witness in the trial of kingpin [[Saber Ben Mahmoud Jelassi]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.lecceprima.it/cronaca/migranti-sfruttati-nei-campi-l-accusa-chiede-15-condanne-per-caporali-e-imprenditori.html|title=Migranti sfruttati nei campi, l'accusa chiede 15 condanne per caporali e imprenditori|work=LeccePrima|access-date=2018-11-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== No Cap ==
Sagnet is  the founder of the [[No Cap Association]], a reward system working with report cards, evaluating how ethically goods have been produced through the parameters ethics, energy, circularity, added value and short supply chain. The organization advocates for the ethical employment of tomato pickers through regulated contracts and without a caporalato, promoting the integration of ethically produced goods into the mainstream consumer market.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.today.it/politica/no-cap-rete-anti-caporalato.html|title=Caporalato, se una legge non basta: "Così usciamo dal modello padroni-schiavi"|work=Today|access-date=2018-11-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;
