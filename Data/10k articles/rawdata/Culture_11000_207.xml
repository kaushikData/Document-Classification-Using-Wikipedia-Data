      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3275">The '''Afrikaans language movement''' is an effort being organized to promote the [[Afrikaans]] language the world over.&lt;ref&gt;Hein Willemse, [http://theconversation.com/more-than-an-oppressors-language-reclaiming-the-hidden-history-of-afrikaans-71838 "More than an oppressor’s language: reclaiming the hidden history of Afrikaans"], ''theconversation.com'', April 27, 2017.&lt;/ref&gt; 

==First language movement==
The [[Afrikaans]] language movement began in 1875, with the effort by [[Stephanus Jacobus du Toit]] to have Afrikaans recognised as a separate language from the [[Dutch language]]. [[Die Patriot]], the first Afrikaans newspaper, was first published in 1876.&lt;ref name=lieaedl&gt;{{cite web|title=African literature: Literatures in European and European-derived languages|url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/8275/African-literature/57044/Literatures-in-European-and-European-derived-languages#ref1027797|publisher=Encyclopædia Britannica|accessdate=23 September 2014|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140909034629/http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/8275/African-literature/57044/Literatures-in-European-and-European-derived-languages#ref1027797|archivedate=9 September 2014|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Second language movement==
The Second Afrikaans Language Movement arose after the defeat of the Boers in the [[Second Anglo-Boer War]], which ended in 1902. The movement, spreading from the [[Cape Province]], led to the ascendancy of Afrikaans over the Dutch language, replacing the latter as the [[medium of instruction]] in schools, as the language of the [[Dutch Reformed Church|Dutch Reformed]] churches, and ultimately as the co-official language of South Africa, in 1925.&lt;ref name=salia&gt;{{cite web|title=South African literature: In Afrikaans|url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/555767/South-African-literature/6781/In-Afrikaans#ref247904|publisher=Encyclopædia Britannica|accessdate=23 September 2014|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140605205440/http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/555767/South-African-literature/6781/In-Afrikaans#ref247904|archivedate=5 June 2014|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Third language movement==
After [[apartheid]] ended in 1994, the status of Afrikaans within South Africa was much reduced. Afrikaans went from having equal status with English to being just one of 11 official languages, leading to a renewed dominance of English in the public sphere. Attempts to reverse the marginalisation of Afrikaans have been described as a third language movement.&lt;ref name=webb&gt;{{cite web |last1=Webb |first1=Vic |title=Constructing an inclusive speech community from two mutually excluding ones: The third Afrikaans language movement |publisher=University of Pretoria |accessdate=23 September 2014 |url=https://repository.up.ac.za/bitstream/handle/2263/13174/Webb_Constructing%282010%29.pdf?sequence=1 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170816173632/http://repository.up.ac.za/bitstream/handle/2263/13174/Webb_Constructing(2010).pdf?sequence=1 |archivedate=16 August 2017 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Allantide''' ({{lang-kw|italic=yes|Kalan Gwav}}, meaning ''first day of winter'', or ''Nos Kalan Gwav'', meaning ''eve of the first day of winter'' and ''Dy' Halan Gwav'', meaning ''day of the first day of winter''), also known as '''Saint Allan's Day''' or the '''Feast of Saint Allan''',&lt;ref name="Office1900"&gt;{{cite book|title=A Descriptive Catalogue of Ancient Deeds in the Public Record Office: Series A, 3837-6122; Series B, 3871-4232; Series C, 2916-3764; Series D. 1-1330|accessdate=27 January 2017|year=1900|publisher=[[Hodges Figgis]]|language=English|page=197}}&lt;/ref&gt; is a [[Cornwall|Cornish]] festival that was traditionally celebrated on the night of 31 October, as well as the following day time, and known elsewhere as [[Allhallowtide]].&lt;ref name="RadfordRadford1961"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Radford|first1=Edwin|last2=Radford|first2=Mona Augusta|title=The Encyclopedia of Superstitions|year=1961|publisher=Barnes &amp; Noble|language=English|isbn=9780760702284|page=15|quote=A Cornish name for the season usually known as Hallowtide was Allantide.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Sim2011"&gt;{{cite book|last=Sim|first=Alison|title=Pleasures and Pastimes in Tudor England|date=8 November 2011|publisher=History Press|language=English|isbn=9780752475783|page=89|quote=The biggest Christian festival of the autumn was the feast of the dead, called Hallowtide or Allantide. It was a spectacular event, designed to help the passage of the souls of the dead through purgatory. After evensong the church bells would be rung to comfort the dead in purgatory and the churches would be illuminated with candles. }}&lt;/ref&gt; The festival, in Cornwall is the liturgical [[feast day]] of St Allan (also spelled St Allen or St Arlan), who was the bishop of [[Quimper]] in the sixth century. As such, Allantide is also known as Allan Night and Allan Day. The origins of the name Allantide also probably stem from the same sources as Hollantide ([[Wales]] and the [[Isle of Man]]) and Hallowe'en itself.  
[[File:Traditional Cornish Jack-o'-Lantern made from a turnip.jpg|thumb|Traditional Cornish [[jack-o'-lantern]] made from a turnip.]]

As with the start of the celebration of Allhallowtide in the rest of [[Christendom]], [[church bells]] were rung in order to comfort Christian souls in the [[Christian views on Hades|intermediate state]].&lt;ref name="Sim2011"/&gt; Another important part of this festival was the giving of Allan apples, large glossy red apples that were highly polished, to family and friends as tokens of good luck. Allan apple markets used to be held throughout West Cornwall in the run up to the feast.

The following is a description of the festival as it was celebrated in [[Penzance]] at the turn of the 19th century:

'':"The shops in Penzance would display Allan apples, which were highly polished large apples. On the day itself, these apples were given as gifts to each member of the family as a token of good luck.  Older girls would place these apples under their pillows and hope to dream of the person whom they would one day marry.  A local game is also recorded where two pieces of wood were nailed together in the shape of a cross.  It was then suspended with 4 candles on each outcrop of the cross shape.  Allan apples would then be suspended under the cross.  The goal of the game was to catch the apples in your mouth, with hot wax being the penalty for slowness or inaccuracy."''&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;* Robert Hunt Popular Romances of the West of England 1902&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;* MA Courtney Folklore and Legends of Cornwall 1890&lt;/ref&gt;

Robert Hunt in his book 'Popular romances of the West of England' describes Allantide in [[St Ives, Cornwall|St Ives]] &lt;ref name="ReferenceA" /&gt;

''THE ancient custom of providing children with a large apple on Allhallows-eve is still observed, to a great extent, at St Ives. "Allan-day," as it is called, is the day of days to hundreds' of children, who would deem it a great misfortune were they to go to bed on "Allan-night" without the time-honoured Allan apple to hide beneath their pillows. A quantity of large apples are thus disposed of the sale of which is dignified by the term Allan Market.''

There are a number of divination games recorded including the throwing of wall nuts in fires to predict the fidelity of partners and the pouring of molten lead into cold water as a way of predicting the occupation of future husbands, the shape of the solidified lead somehow indicating this.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"&gt;*Simon Reed - The Cornish Traditional Year 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

In some parts of Cornwall "Tindle" fires were lit similar in nature to the Coel Coth (Coel Certh) of Wales.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"/&gt;

Prior to the 20th Century the parish feast of [[St Just in Penwith]] was known as Allantide.&lt;ref&gt;*[[A. K. Hamilton Jenkin]] - Cornwall and the Cornish 1932&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Black Dynamite''''' is an American adult animated television series based on the [[Black Dynamite|2009 film of the same name]], although the series follows a separate continuity, with some back-references to the film.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|title=Black Dynamite|date=2000-01-01|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1608383/|accessdate=2016-12-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; The series was announced shortly after the release of the film,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Boyle|first=Christopher|title=Interview With Black Dynamite Composer/Editor Adrian Younge|url=http://www.newsli.com/2009/11/17/interview-with-black-dynamite-composereditor-adrian-younge/|accessdate=28 April 2012|newspaper=NewsLi|date=November 17, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Paine|first=Jake|title=Black Dynamite Releases To DVD, Announces Adult Swim Series|url=http://www.hiphopdx.com/index/news/id.10630/title.black-dynamite-releases-to-dvd-announces-adult-swim-series|accessdate=28 April 2012|newspaper=HipHopDX|date=Feb 14, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; the 10-minute pilot episode was released on Adult Swim Video on August 8, 2011, and the full series premiered on [[Cartoon Network|Cartoon Network's]] late night programming block, [[Adult Swim]], on July 15, 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Arceneaux|first=Michael|title=Black Dynamite Trailer Released|url=http://www.bet.com/news/celebrities/2011/07/22/black-dynamite-trailer-released.html|accessdate=28 April 2012|newspaper=[[Bet.com|BET]]|date=Jul 22, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Hurray! 'Black Dynamite' coming to Adult Swim|newspaper=[[Kansas City Star]]|date=Apr 6, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; It ended on January 10, 2015 with a total of 20 episodes. Most episodes of the show were rated TV-MA (akin to the R rating of the movie itself) for bloody, stylized violence, strong sexual references (including nudity, references to prostitution, and depictions of sex acts), and humor derived from racism and discrimination.

[[Michael Jai White]], Byron Minns, [[Tommy Davidson]] and [[Kym Whitley]] reprise their film roles as Black Dynamite, Bullhorn, Cream Corn and Honeybee, respectively.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Carp|first=Jesse|title=Watch Adult Swim's Black Dynamite Animated Pilot, You Jive Turkey|url=http://www.cinemablend.com/television/Watch-Adult-Swim-Black-Dynamite-Animated-Pilot-You-Jive-Turkey-34221.html|accessdate=28 April 2012|newspaper=Cinema Blend|date=Aug 11, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Throughout the first and second seasons, [[Cedric Yarbrough]] also reprised his film role as Chocolate Giddy-Up, along with Jimmy Walker Jr. as the restaurant owner Roscoe. It was produced by Ars Nova, Jon Steingart, Carl Jones and Jillian Apfelbaum are executive producers, with [[Brian Ash]] as co-executive producer. [[Scott Sanders (director)|Scott Sanders]], White and Minns are producers. Monica Jones is associate producer. [[LeSean Thomas]] is creative producer/supervising director. The original music is by [[Adrian Younge]].

==Premise==
The show, set in the 1970s, is predominantly a [[parody]] of and tribute to [[blaxploitation]] cinema. The show continues the story of Black Dynamite, Bullhorn, Cream Corn, and Honey Bee as they engage in dangerous and over-the-top misadventures sometimes involving famous celebrities such as [[Michael Jackson]], [[O. J. Simpson]], [[Bill Cosby]], [[Sidney Poitier]], [[Richard Pryor]], [[Don Cornelius]], [[Dick Clark]], [[Spike Lee]], [[Mr. T]], [[Diff'rent Strokes|Orphan Arnold]], [[James Brown]], [[Isaac Hayes]], [[Bob Marley]], [[Elvis Presley]] and [[Fred Rogers]] as well as Black Dynamite's recurring nemesis President [[Richard Nixon]], who was also the main villain from the film. The show makes references to the original ''Black Dynamite'' film, such as Fiendish Dr. Wu as the leader of a group of ninjas; the show follows its own continuity, as some characters from the film who were killed off are alive in the series.

| ShortSummary = Cream Corn is excited as hell at getting a chance to dance on [[Soul Train|Soooooooul Train]], the hippest trip in America, but Black Dynamite knows the truth that the music game is a vicious battle to-the-death between the Godfather [[Don Cornelius]] (voiced by [[Kevin Michael Richardson]]) and murderous [[Dick Clark]] of [[American Bandstand]] (voiced by [[Eric Bauza]]). Cream Corn becomes a Soul Train dancer and Don Cornelius' old muscle Black Dynamite sees that just when he thought he was out…they pull him back in.

| ShortSummary = Child Services is finally on to the Whorephanage and slaps them with a shutdown notice! But it's okay, because rich white Mr. [[List of Diff'rent Strokes characters|Phil Drummond and his rich white friends]] (all voiced by [[Corey Burton]]) adopt all the orphans at once and whisk them off to a luxury high-rise in the sky. Just as Black Dynamite comes to terms with no longer having the Orphans around, he learns that luxury skyscraper is actually a deathmatch arena where the Orphans fight each other to the death for food! He's got to put an end to these [[The Hunger Games|Hunger Pang Games]], no matter how popular they are!

* [[Alexander Calder]] described his 1927 mobile "Josephine Baker (III)", made after the late African-American performer [[Josephine Baker]], as "tantalizing", wriggling its metal pieces that represented her breasts and torso during the filming of a Pathé newsreel, 1929.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/jonathonkeats/2015/12/07/see-alexander-calder-revive-josephine-baker-at-this-tate-modern-retrospective/#6061ca811987|title=See Alexander Calder Make Josephine Baker Dance At This Lively Tate Retrospective|website=Forbes.com|date=December 7, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://supercommunity.e-flux.com/texts/do-you-see-it-well-it-doesnt-see-you/|title=DO YOU SEE IT?

* In 1967-68 artist [[Bruce Nauman]] made two videos (among many performance-based videos) in which he presents the idea of the contemporary artist as a somewhat business-like but degraded clown/actor. In ''Art Make-Up'' (1967–68) Nauman videotapes himself applying successive layers of white, pink, green and black makeup to his entire face, arms, and torso. In ''Flesh to White to Black to Flesh'' (1968) he videotapes himself applying white make-up to his face and body, then black make-up, then wiping the make-up away to re-expose his skin.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.eai.org/titles/art-make-up|title=Electronic Arts Intermix: Art Make-Up, Bruce Nauman|website=www.eai.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.eai.org/titles/flesh-to-white-to-black-to-flesh|title=Electronic Arts Intermix: Flesh to White to Black to Flesh, Bruce Nauman|website=www.eai.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Artist [[Cindy Sherman]] used blackface performance in 1976.  These rarely seen performances came to light in 2015, when [[Margo Jefferson]] wrote "the blacks are all exactly the same color, the color of traditional blackface makeup. They all have nearly the same features, too, while Ms. Sherman is able to give the white characters she impersonates a real range of skin tones and facial features. This didn't look like irony to me. It looked like a stale visual myth that was still in good working order."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://hyperallergic.com/246851/cindy-sherman-in-blackface/|title=Cindy Sherman in Blackface|date=2015-10-29|work=Hyperallergic|access-date=2017-07-10|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://creators.vice.com/en_us/article/53wkxb/cindygate-and-the-lasting-stain-of-cindy-shermans-blackface-photos|title=#CindyGate and the Lasting Stain of Cindy Sherman's Blackface Photos|website=Creators|language=en-us|access-date=2017-07-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://superselected.com/cindygate-cindy-shermans-attempt-to-explain-blackface-portraits-isnt-cutting-it/|title=#CindyGate.

* In experimental theater collective [[The Wooster Group]]'s "Route 1 and 9" (1981), several actors including [[Willem Dafoe]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://thewoostergroup.org/twg/projects/1and9/index.html|title=THE WOOSTER GROUP - Route 1 &amp; 9 (The Last Act)|website=thewoostergroup.org|access-date=2017-07-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; don blackface.

* [[Kendell Geers]], a white Afrikaner from Johannesburg, dons a [[Nelson Mandela]] "mask" in ''Portrait of the artist as a young man'' (1993). His 2007 work ''Fuckface'' is a photograph of Geers's face painted black and white with the word 'fuck' in bold letters, reading forward and backward.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://kimberly-bradley.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/AR-May-2013-Kendell-Geers1.pdf|title=Love Is Colder Than Capital |last=Bradley |first=Kimberly |date=May 2013|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.kendellgeers.com/library/works/485|title=Kendell Geers|website=www.kendellgeers.com|language=en|access-date=2017-07-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Vanessa Beecroft]] has used white models painted black on several occasions. In the 2007 work ''VB61'', and again in the ''Le Membre Fantôme'' in 2015. On collaborating with [[Kanye West]], Beecroft has stated "I am protected by Kanye's talent. I become Black. I am no longer Vanessa Beecroft and I am free to do whatever I want because Kanye allows it."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://artfcity.com/2016/08/09/vanessa-beecroft-continues-to-prove-she-doesnt-deserve-comparison-with-rachel-dolezal/|title=Vanessa Beecroft Continues to Prove She Doesn't Deserve Comparison With Rachel Dolezal|last=Farley|first=Michael Anthony|last2=Kirsch|first2=Corinna|date=2016-08-10|website=Art F City|access-date=2017-07-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.ebony.com/news-views/kanye-west-beecroft|title=Vanessa Beecroft, Kanye West Cannot Offer Racial Amnesty - EBONY|website=www.ebony.com|language=en-US|access-date=2017-07-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://hyperallergic.com/316758/vanessa-beecroft-publicly-airs-her-racist-perspective/|title=Vanessa Beecroft Publicly Airs a Racist Perspective|date=2016-08-10|work=Hyperallergic|access-date=2017-07-10|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* In 2010 [[The Public Theatre]]/Public LAB in New York premiered a play by [[Branden Jacobs-Jenkins]] titled '' Neighbors'' in which the stage design presented two interior spaces divided by a shared wall. On one side the play is portrayed by actors, on the other side it is portrayed by actors wearing blackface. ''Neighbors'' was presented later that year by the Matrix Theatre Company, and in 2011 by Mixed Blood Theater, Minneapolis, and Company One theater in Boston.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://variety.com/2010/legit/reviews/neighbors-1117942361/|title=Neighbors|first=Marilyn|last=Stasio|date=8 March 2010|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Eleanor Antin]] has a recurring character "Eleanora Antinova", an "African-American ballerina" that she frequently performed in blackface. Antin says on Antinova "I've had as previous personas a king, a nurse and a movie star. But the ballerina is ideal, because as an artist she's an outsider, like women and blacks in our society. And a black ballerina is a condition contrary to fact, even today. Which makes her a very glamorous and rich image." and "Some blacks and white liberals get uptight when they hear about it, but after seeing a performance they're on my side. Besides, Antinova is a survivor, a very positive and heroic image."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://hyperallergic.com/95936/the-many-faces-of-eleanor-antin/|title=The Many Faces of Eleanor Antin|date=2013-11-29|work=Hyperallergic|access-date=2017-07-10|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="bostonglobe_2014-04-11"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.bostonglobe.com/arts/2014/04/11/eleanor-antin-show-ica-explores-identity/oUdfUzmhx689860PGE4RCJ/story.html|title=Eleanor Antin show at the ICA explores identity - The Boston Globe|work=BostonGlobe.com|access-date=2017-07-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a 2012 re-staging, Antin was replaced by Danièle Watts, a Black performer.&lt;ref name="bostonglobe_2014-04-11"/&gt;

* [[Lili Reynaud-Dewar]]'s 2009 ''Black Mariah'' "engaged a quartet of costumed female performers, some of whom were in blackface." Her 2010 work ''Cléda's Chairs'' features two white girls in blackface covering antique chairs with black polish. In 2011 Reynaud-Dewar completed a suite of artworks under the title ''Some Objects Blackened and a Body Too,'' in which she applied [[Kohl (cosmetics)|kohl]] to such things as a folded white [[dress shirt]], plaster casts of [[Raised fist|clenched fists]], and a painted wooden pedestal. The suite includes a four-minute video titled ''What a pity you're an architect, Monsieur. You'd make a sensational Partner (After Josephine Baker)'' in which Reynaud-Dewar dances around her studio among the blackened objects in fully naked blackface. The title of the work is alleged to be what African-American dancer [[Josephine Baker]] said as a rebuff to the sexual advances of French designer [[Le Corbusier]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://frieze.com/article/lili-reynaud-dewar|title=Lili Reynaud Dewar|website=frieze.com|language=en|access-date=2017-07-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.marymarygallery.co.uk/programme/some-objects-blackened-and-a-body-too/text/|title=Some objects blackened and a body too – Mary Mary|website=www.marymarygallery.co.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* Performance artist [[Martha Wilson]], who has impersonated other First Ladies [[Nancy Reagan]], [[Barbara Bush]] and Second Lady [[Tipper Gore]], impersonated [[Michelle Obama]] (with half her face in blackface) in a forum on performance art organized by [[Clifford Owens]] at the [[Brooklyn Academy of Music]] in 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.bam.org/theater/2014/brooklyn-bred-2-clifford-owens|title=Brooklyn Bred 2: Clifford Owens|website=BAM.org|access-date=2017-07-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="hyperallergic_247053"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://hyperallergic.com/247053/in-martha-wilsons-new-photo-works-feminism-meets-the-absurd/|title=In Martha Wilson's New Photo Works, Feminism Meets the Absurd|date=2015-10-24|work=Hyperallergic|access-date=2017-07-14|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://themorningnews.org/article/performance-art-today-with-artist-martha-wilson|title=In Her Own Skin - The Morning News|last=Wood|first=Emma Winsor|website=themorningnews.org|access-date=2017-07-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; Wilson also created the portrait "Martha Meets Michelle Halfway," in which she is pictured with half her face and one arm in blackface makeup.&lt;ref name="hyperallergic_247053"/&gt;

* In 2012, Dean Moss programmed three non-black performers into the Parallels series, a [[Danspace Project]] program devoted to non-traditional black dance claiming "None of them are African-American... but all of them are black." Using the framework of blackness as metaphor, Ann Liv Young performed "in a fuchsia dress, an Afro wig and blackface." She announced "I am doing something here tonight that could be offensive, right? Cause look, you can wipe this off." She swiped her face. "I am very white underneath." "Are you gay?" she asked an audience member. "Good for you. Gay is like being black in some ways."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2012/02/21/arts/dance/dean-moss-program-part-of-parallels-at-danspace-project.html|title=Dean Moss Program, Part of Parallels at Danspace Project|last=Kourlas|first=Gia|date=2012-02-20|work=The New York Times|access-date=2017-07-10|language=en-US|issn=0362-4331}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://hyperallergic.com/48043/on-black-dance-shifting-movement-words-identities/|title=On Black Dance: Shifting Movement, Words, Identities|date=2012-03-10|work=Hyperallergic|access-date=2017-07-10|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.nytheatre-wire.com/hb12023t.htm|title=The Natives Are Restless Tonight|website=www.nytheatre-wire.com|access-date=2017-07-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.newyorker.com/culture/culture-desk/a-history-lesson|title=A History Lesson|website=The New Yorker|access-date=2017-07-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* On September 30, 2012—her birthday—American artist [[Adrian Piper]] retired from being black. For the occasion Piper ceremoniously donned blackface, photographed herself, and declared the resulting performance and image and artwork titled ''Thwarted Projects, Dashed Hopes, A Moment of Embarrassment'' (2012).&lt;ref name="adrianpiper.com"/&gt;
* In 2014, the [[Museum of Modern Art]] New York announced that it had discovered a long lost film in its [[Biograph Company]] archive. Titled ''[[Lime Kiln Field Day]]'', the film was the brainchild of Biograph and New York producers [[Klaw and Erlanger]]. The film features an integrated cast starring [[Bert Williams]] as well as Sam Lucas, Abbie Mitchell, J. Leubrie Hill, and members of Williams' [[Darktown Follies]] stage company. A fully restored version of the film was screened at MoMA in 2016. In the film, Bert Williams appears in blackface. Theater conventions at the time required one performer in a black musical to wear blackface but the rest of the cast could perform without it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2014/09/21/nyregion/coming-soon-a-century-late-a-black-film-gem.html|title=Coming Soon, a Century Late: A Black Film Gem|first=Felicia R.|last=Lee|date=20 September 2014|publisher=|via=NYTimes.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Through radio and television interviews, Lennon explained his use of the term "[[nigger]]" as referring to any oppressed person.

* In 1997, [[Aboriginal Australians|Aboriginal]] artist Eddie Burrup was revealed to be a pseudonym of the White painter [[Elizabeth Durack]], an identity she considered her "[[alter ego]]". Work she had made pretending to be Burrup had been circulating in the Aboriginal Australian arts scene throughout the 1990s. John Mundine, an Aboriginal art curator, remarked that "it's the last thing left that you could possibly take away other than our lives or shoot us all."&lt;ref&gt;Maynard, Roger (8 March 1997). "Aboriginal male artist unveiled as white woman". ''The Times, London''.&lt;/ref&gt; Durack was bemused by the controversy, remarking "I'm just using a nom de plume.

* In 2007, Chicago-based artist [[Theaster Gates]] had an exhibition at the [[Hyde Park Art Center]] titled ''Plate Convergence'' in which he manifested a marketing ploy for selling ceramic objects that Gates himself had made. The saga involved Shoji Yamaguchi, a Japanese-born potter who had emigrated to the United States after WWII and took up residence in Mississippi, where he married a local black woman and [[Civil Rights]] activist and developed a plate especially suitable for the cuisine of black people. The plate became the basis for dinner parties and ultimately a full-blown salon for discussing art and politics. Then calamity struck. In Gates' own words, "As the story went, [Yamaguchi] and his wife died in a car accident in 1991 and their son founded the Yamaguchi Institute to continue their vision of social transformation. I made ceramic plates, videotaped highly curated dinners and found a space for an exhibition of the ceramics and video. We gave a huge Japanese soul-food dinner, made by a Japanese chef and my sister, in honor of the Yamaguchis and their dinners. A young mixed-race artist enacted the role of their son and thanked everyone for coming. The whole thing duped a lot of people."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.artinamericamagazine.com/news-features/magazine/theaster-gates/|title=Theaster Gates – Art in America|website=www.artinamericamagazine.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* In 2007, after several years of writing the character, [[Joe Scanlan (artist)|Joe Scanlan]] held auditions and then engaged two professional female actors, Jennifer Kidwell and Abigail Ramsay, to play the role of a fictional black artist named Donelle Woolford. As part of the back story and set design for the character, Scanlan had made a body of abstract collage works reminiscent of Cubism.&lt;ref&gt;http://bombmagazine.org/article/3580/&lt;/ref&gt; Ramsay performed the character in situ at the ICA London as part of an exhibition titled ''Double Agent'', curated by [[Claire Bishop]]. A later iteration of the project was a play on [[Richard Prince]]'s joke paintings and included a national comedy tour titled ''Dick's Last Stand'' adapted from a stand-up routine by Richard Pryor and performed by Kidwell and Scanlan. The project was included in the 2014 [[Whitney Biennial]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://observer.com/2014/03/theres-something-funny-about-donelle-woolford/|title=There's Something Funny About Donelle Woolford|date=2014-03-03|work=Observer|access-date=2017-07-10|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2014/05/17/arts/design/racially-themed-work-stirs-conflict-at-whitney-biennial.html|title=Racially Themed Work Stirs Conflict at Whitney Biennial|last=Lee|first=Felicia R.|date=2014-05-16|work=The New York Times|access-date=2017-07-10|language=en-US|issn=0362-4331}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/arts/miranda/la-et-cam-donelle-woolford-controversy-whitney-biennial-20140609-column.html|title=Art and race at the Whitney: Rethinking the Donelle Woolford debate|last=Miranda|first=Carolina A.|date=2014-06-17|work=Los Angeles Times|access-date=2017-07-10|language=en-US|issn=0458-3035}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Carl "Charlie" Brandt''' (February 23, 1957 &amp;ndash; September 13, 2004) was an [[United States|American]] [[serial killer]]. A former resident of [[Fort Wayne, Indiana|Fort Wayne]], [[Indiana]] and longtime resident of the [[Florida Keys]], Brandt committed suicide in September 2004 after he stabbed his wife, Teresa "Teri" Brandt, and [[decapitation|decapitated]] and severely mutilated his [[niece]], Michelle Jones, by removing her heart. An investigation by police concluded that Brandt hanged himself in Jones' garage after committing the murders.

It later came to light that Brandt had shot his parents &amp;ndash; his pregnant mother fatally &amp;ndash; in 1971, when he was 13; he spent one year at a psychiatric hospital before being released, and was never criminally charged. Because of this incident, and because of Brandt's efficiency in killing his wife and niece and his hidden obsession with [[human anatomy]], investigators looked into the prospect that he had committed other murders since moving to Florida in 1973. Police have positively ascribed up to six homicides to Brandt.

== Early life ==
Brandt was the second child and only son of Herbert and Ilse Brandt, two [[German people|German]] immigrants who originally lived in [[Connecticut]]. His father worked as a laborer for a division of [[International Harvester]], eventually working his way up to draftsman and project engineer. However, the family frequently moved, and as a result, Brandt and his older sister Angela attended several different schools. He was regarded as a good student, but was shy and had difficulty adjusting to new surroundings. In September 1968, Herbert was transferred to International Harvester's plant in [[Fort Wayne, Indiana|Fort Wayne]], [[Indiana]]. Every summer and Christmas, the family would vacation in [[Florida]], where Brandt went on hunting trips with his father.

== 1971 incident ==
On the night of January 3, 1971, Brandt, then 13, walked into his parents' bathroom while Herbert was shaving and Ilse, who was eight months pregnant, was taking a bath. Brandt shot both parents at point blank range; his father survived, but his mother died at the scene. Brandt then confronted his sister Angela, but his gun wouldn't fire. After a physical struggle, Angela managed to calm her brother down before she fled the house and sought help from neighbors. Brandt also left the house and knocked on the door of a girl next door named Sandi Radcliffe, telling her, "Sandi, I just shot my mom and dad." Herbert Brandt later identified his son as his attacker.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cbsnews.com/8301-18559_162-1655084.html?pageNum=3 Deadly Obsession] Page 3, CBS News, 25 May 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

Because he was too young to be charged with murder under Indiana law, Brandt appeared before a [[grand jury]] and was ordered to undergo three separate [[psychiatric evaluation]]s, all of which couldn't determine what motivated him to shoot his parents. One of Brandt's psychiatrists, Ronald Pancner, later recounted, "Basically, I was looking for [[mental illness]]. And he wasn't showing the signs and symptoms of serious mental illness, which I thought was what the court wanted to know." Interviews with Brandt's family and friends showed that he had no conflicts at home or at school, and had previously shown nothing but devotion to his mother. Brandt spent one year at a psychiatric hospital before being released back into the custody of his family.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cbsnews.com/8301-18559_162-1655084.html?pageNum=4 Deadly Obsession] Page 4, CBS News, 25 May 2006&lt;/ref&gt; They never spoke of the incident again, and Brandt's younger sisters were never told about the shooting.

== 2004 incident ==
Shortly after Brandt's release, his family relocated to Florida. One year later, Brandt's father and sisters moved away after he remarried, while Brandt himself remained in Florida under the care of his grandparents. In 1984, Brandt got a degree on electronics and became a radar specialist. In 1986, he married his girlfriend Teri. No relatives were invited to their wedding. The couple settled in a beach house of [[Big Pine Key]], the southernmost portion of the [[Florida Keys]], in 1989. 

On September 2, 2004, Brandt and Teri evacuated from their home ahead of [[Hurricane Ivan]]. Their niece, Michelle Lynn Jones, invited them to stay at her residence in near [[Orlando, Florida|Orlando]]. Throughout the visit, Jones kept in regular contact with her mother, Mary Lou, as well as several friends. On the evening of September 13, one of Jones' friends, Lisa Emmons, was scheduled to visit her house. However, Jones discouraged her from coming after reporting that the Brandts had an argument after drinking.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cbsnews.com/8301-18559_162-1655084.html?pageNum=2 Deadly Obsession] Page 2, CBS News, 25 May 2006&lt;/ref&gt; After that night, Jones stopped answering telephone calls, which alarmed her acquaintances.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mlj-foundation.org/history.html History] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131021051320/http://mlj-foundation.org/history.html# |date=2013-10-21 }}, Michelle Lynn Jones Foundation. Retrieved 2 June 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

On September 15, another one of Jones' friends, Debbie Knight, came to her house to check on her while on the phone with Jones' mother. After finding the front door locked, Knight tried to enter the house through the garage, where she found Brandt's [[human decomposition|decomposing]] body hanging from the rafters. Knight contacted the police, who entered the house and found the bodies of Brandt's wife and niece. Teri had been stabbed seven times in the chest while reclining on a couch. Jones had been [[decapitation|decapitated]] and [[disembowelment|disemboweled]], with her [[human heart|heart]] and [[human organs|organs]] removed. Jones' head was also placed next to her own body.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wsvn.com/features/articles/investigations/MI20479/ 7 News Investigations: Killer Connection] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110109150114/http://www.wsvn.com/features/articles/investigations/MI20479/ |date=January 9, 2011 }}, WSVN-TV, 15 May 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; The weapons used in the crimes had been knives from Jones' kitchen.

== Investigation ==
A search of Brandt's residence on Big Pine Key revealed that he was a monthly subscriber to [[Victoria's Secret]] [[Trade literature|catalog]]s; had an extensive collection of surgery-themed books, posters, and clippings; and regularly searched online for autopsy photos and [[snuff film]] websites depicting violence against women. Because Brandt's murder of Jones indicated methodology and past experience, and because he traveled often due to his job, police checked [[cold case]]s in Florida that matched his apparent ''[[modus operandi]]'', and launched requests for similar inquiries in the United States and abroad. Ultimately, the search linked Brandt to twenty-six unsolved murders in Florida dating back to 1973.

* '''Carol Sullivan, 1978:''' Sullivan, aged 12, was abducted from a school bus stop in [[Volusia County]] on September 20, 1978. Her skull was found inside a bucket, leading authorities to presume she was murdered and decapitated. Brandt was 20 years old and lived in Volusia County at the time, but could not be tied to the crime in any other way. 
* '''Lisa Saunders, 1988:''' Saunders, aged 20, was beaten, stabbed, and dragged from her car in Big Pine Key in December 1988. Her heart was missing when she was found, but it is unclear if it was extracted by an attacker or eaten by vultures. 
* '''Sherry Perisho, 1989:''' Perisho's partially-clothed body was found on July 16, 1989, near the North Pine Channel Bridge at Big Pine Key, where Perisho, who was homeless, lived on a [[dinghy]]. Her throat had been slashed and her head had been nearly severed; like Jones, her body was extensively mutilated and her heart was removed. Perisho was found less than 1,000 feet from where Brandt lived, and Brandt matched a [[composite sketch]] of a man seen crossing [[U.S. Route 1]] near where Perisho was discovered on the night she was murdered. Based on this evidence, [[Monroe County, Florida|Monroe County]] investigators determined that Brandt killed Perisho and officially closed the case on May 6, 2006.&lt;ref&gt;[http://articles.orlandosentinel.com/2006-05-06/news/MBRANDT06_1_brandt-monroe-county-seminole Killer tied to '89 death -- wife suspected him all along], ''The Orlando Sentinel'', 6 May 2006&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''Darlene Toler, 1995:''' Toler was a [[prostitute]] from [[Miami]] whose body, missing her head and heart, was found near a highway wrapped in plastic. Brandt used the same highway regularly and he kept a mileage record of his travels, which shows an entry for 100 miles {{ndash}} the driving distance between Big Pine Key and Miami {{ndash}} on the day of her murder.

[[File:Gustave doré crusades the childrens crusade.jpg|thumb|''The Children's Crusade'', by [[Gustave Doré]]]]
The '''Children's Crusade''' was a failed [[Popular crusades|popular crusade]] by European [[Christians]] to regain the [[Holy Land]] from the [[Muslim]]s, said to have taken place in 1212. The crusaders left areas of [[Northern France]], led by Stephen of Cloyes, and Germany, led by Nicholas. The traditional narrative is likely conflated from some factual and mythical events which include the visions by a French boy and a German boy, an intention to peacefully convert Muslims in the Holy Land to Christianity, bands of children marching to [[Italy]], and children being sold into [[slavery]]. Many children were tricked by merchants and sailed over to what they thought were the holy lands but, in reality, were slave markets.

==Accounts==
===Traditional accounts===

The variants of the long-standing story of the Children's Crusade have similar themes.&lt;ref name="russel"/&gt; A boy begins to preach in either France or Germany, claims that he had been visited by Jesus, who instructed him to lead a [[Crusade]] in order to peacefully convert Muslims to Christianity. Through a series of portents and miracles he gains a following of up to 30,000&amp;nbsp;children. He leads his followers south towards the [[Mediterranean Sea]], in the belief that the sea would part on their arrival, which would allow him and his followers to walk to [[Jerusalem]]. This does not happen. The children are sold to two merchants (Hugh the Iron and William of Posqueres), who give free passage on boats to as many of the children as are willing. The pilgrims are then either taken to [[Tunisia]], where they are sold into slavery by the merchants or else die in a [[shipwreck]] on [[San Pietro Island]] off [[Sardinia]] during a [[gale]]. A few may have failed to reach the sea, and die or give up from [[starvation]] and [[exhaustion]]. They had been betrayed by some of the adults in their group.

===Modern accounts===
According to more recent researchers{{Who|reason=This should be deweaselfied.|date=September 2016}} there seem to have actually been two movements of people (of all ages) in 1212 in Germany and France.&lt;ref name="raedts"/&gt;&lt;ref name="russel"/&gt; The similarities of the two allowed later chroniclers to combine and embellish the tales.

====Nicholas of Cologne in Germany====
In the first movement, Nicholas, an eloquent shepherd from the [[Rhineland]] in Germany,&lt;ref name="bridge1980"&gt;Bridge, Antony. ''The Crusades''. London: Granada Publishing, 1980. {{ISBN|0-531-09872-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; tried to lead a group across the [[Alps]] and into Italy in the early spring of 1212. Nicholas said that the sea would dry up before them and allow his followers to cross into the Holy Land. Rather than intending to fight the [[Saracens]], he said that the Muslim kingdoms would be defeated when their citizens converted to Christianity.&lt;ref name="bridge1980"/&gt; His disciples went off to preach the call for the "Crusade" across the German lands, and they massed in [[Cologne]] after a few weeks. Splitting into two groups, the crowds took different roads through Switzerland. Two out of every three people on the journey died, while many others returned to their homes.&lt;ref name="bridge1980"/&gt; About 7,000 arrived in [[Genoa]] in late August. They immediately marched to the harbor, expecting the sea to divide before them; when it did not many became bitterly disappointed. A few accused Nicholas of betraying them, while others settled down to wait for God to change his mind, since they believed that it was unthinkable he would not eventually do so. The Genovese authorities were impressed by the little band, and they offered citizenship to those who wished to settle in their city. Most of the would-be Crusaders took up this opportunity.&lt;ref name="bridge1980"/&gt; Nicholas refused to say he was defeated and traveled to [[Pisa]], his movement continuing to break up along the way. He and a few loyal followers continued to the [[Papal States]], where they met [[Pope Innocent III]]. The remaining ones departed for Germany after the [[Pontiff]] exhorted them to be good and to return home to their families. Nicholas did not survive the second attempt across the Alps; back home his father was arrested and hanged under pressure from angry families whose relatives had perished while following the child.&lt;ref name="bridge1980"/&gt;

Some of the most dedicated members of this Crusade were later reported to have wandered to [[Ancona]] and [[Brindisi]]; none are known to have reached the Holy Land.&lt;ref name="bridge1980"/&gt;

====Stephen of Cloyes in France====
The second movement was led by a twelve-year-old&lt;ref name="bridge1980"/&gt; French shepherd boy named Stephen of [[Cloyes-sur-le-Loir|Cloyes]], who said in June that he bore a letter for the king of France from Jesus. Large gangs of youth around his age were drawn to him, most of whom claimed to possess special gifts of God and thought themselves miracle workers. Attracting a following of over 30,000 adults and children, he went to [[Saint-Denis, Seine-Saint-Denis|Saint-Denis]], where he was seen to cause miracles. On the orders of [[Philip II of France|Philip II]], advised by the [[University of Paris]], the people were implored to return home. Philip himself did not appear impressed, especially since his unexpected visitors were led by a mere child, and refused to take them seriously. Stephen, however, was not dissuaded, and began preaching at a nearby abbey. From Saint-Denis, Stephen traveled around France, spreading his messages as he went, promising to lead charges of Christ to Jerusalem. Although the Church was skeptical, many adults were impressed by his teaching.&lt;ref name="bridge1980"/&gt; A few of those who initially joined him possessed his activeness; it is estimated that there were less than half the initial 30,000 remaining, a figure that was shrinking rapidly, rather than growing as perhaps anticipated.

At the end of June 1212, Stephen led his largely juvenile Crusaders from [[Vendôme]] to [[Marseilles]]. They survived by begging for food, while the vast majority seem to have been disheartened by the hardship of this journey and returned to their families.&lt;ref name="bridge1980"/&gt;

==Historiography==
{{Crusade}}

===Sources===
According to Peter Raedts, professor in Medieval History at the [[Radboud University Nijmegen]], there are only about 50&amp;nbsp;sources from the period that talk about the crusade, ranging from a few sentences to half a page.&lt;ref name="raedts"/&gt; Raedts categorizes the sources into three types depending on when they were written:&lt;ref name="raedts"/&gt;
#Contemporary sources written by 1220;
#Sources written between 1220 and 1250 (the authors could have been alive at the time of the crusade but wrote their memories down later);
#Sources written after 1250 by authors who received their information second or third hand.

Raedts does not consider the sources after 1250 to be authoritative, and of those before 1250, he considers only about 20 to be authoritative. It is only in the later non-authoritative narratives that a "children's crusade" is implied by such authors as [[Vincent of Beauvais]], [[Roger Bacon]], [[Thomas of Cantimpré]], [[Matthew Paris]] and many others.

===Historical studies===
Prior to Raedts's study of 1977, there had only been a few historical publications researching the Children's Crusade. The earliest were by the Frenchman G. de Janssens (1891) and the German [[Reinhold Röhricht]] (1876). They analyzed the sources but did not analyze the story. American medievalist [[Dana Carleton Munro]] (1913–14), according to Raedts, provided the best analysis of the sources to date and was the first to significantly provide a convincingly sober account of the Crusade stripped of legends.&lt;ref&gt;Munro, D. C. (1913–14). "The Children's Crusade". ''American Historical Review''. 19:516–24.&lt;/ref&gt; Later, J. E. Hansbery (1938–9) published a correction of Munro's work, but it has since been discredited as based on an unreliable source.&lt;ref name="raedts"/&gt; German psychiatrist [[Justus Hecker]] (1865) did give an original interpretation of the crusade, but it was a polemic about "diseased religious emotionalism" that has since been discredited.&lt;ref name="raedts"/&gt;

P. Alphandery (1916) first published his ideas about the crusade in 1916 in an article which was later published in book form in 1959. He considered the story of the crusade to be an expression of the medieval cult of the Innocents, as a sort of sacrificial rite in which the Innocents gave themselves up for the good of [[Christendom]]; however, he based his ideas on some of the most untrustworthy sources.&lt;ref&gt;Alphandery, P. (1954). ''La Chrétienté et l'idée de croisade''. 2 vols.&lt;/ref&gt;

Adolf Waas (1956) saw the Children's Crusade as a manifestation of chivalric piety and as a protest against the glorification of the holy war.&lt;ref&gt;Waas, A. (1956). ''Geschichte der Kreuzzüge''&lt;/ref&gt; H. E. Mayer (1960) further developed Alphandery's ideas of the Innocents, saying children were the chosen people of God because they were the poorest; recognizing the cult of poverty, he said that "the Children's Crusade marked both the triumph and the failure of the idea of poverty."&lt;ref&gt;Mayer, H.E. (1972). ''The Crusades''&lt;/ref&gt; Giovanni Miccoli (1961) was the first to note that the contemporary sources did not portray the participants as children. It was this recognition that undermined all other interpretations,&lt;ref&gt;Miccoli, G. (1961). "La crociata dei fancifulli". ''Studi medievali''. Third Series, 2:407–43&lt;/ref&gt; except perhaps that of [[Norman Cohn]] (1971) who saw it as a [[chiliastic]] movement in which the poor tried to escape the misery of their everyday lives.&lt;ref&gt;Cohn, N. (1971). ''The pursuit of the millennium''. London.&lt;/ref&gt; Peter Raedts's analysis of 1977 is considered the best source to date to cover the many issues surrounding the Children's Crusade.&lt;ref name="russel"/&gt;

Historians have put the crusade in the context of the role of teenage boys in medieval warfare.&lt;ref&gt;Kelly DeVries, "Teenagers at War During the Middle Ages" in ''The Premodern Teenager: Youth in Society, 1150-1650'' (2002) ed by Konrad Eisenbichler pp 207-223.&lt;/ref&gt; Literary scholars have explored its role in the evolution of the tale of the [[Pied Piper of Hamelin|Pied Piper]].&lt;ref&gt;Bernard Queenan, "The Evolution of the Pied Piper," ''Children's Literature'' (1978) 7#1 pp: 104-114.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Popular accounts===
Beyond the scientific studies there are many popular versions and theories about the Children's Crusades. Norman Zacour in the survey ''A History of the Crusades'' (1962) generally follows Munro's conclusions, and adds that there was a psychological instability of the age, concluding the Children's Crusade "remains one of a series of social explosions, through which medieval men and women—and children too—found release".

[[Steven Runciman]] gives an account of the Children's Crusade in his ''A History of the Crusades''.&lt;ref&gt;Runciman, Steven (1951). [http://www.historyguide.org/ancient/children.html "The Children's Crusade"], from ''A History of the Crusades''.&lt;/ref&gt; Raedts notes that "Although he cites Munro's article in his notes, his narrative is so wild that even the unsophisticated reader might wonder if he had really understood it." [[Donald Spoto]], in a book about Saint [[Francis of Assisi]], said monks were motivated to call them children, and not wandering poor, because being poor was considered pious and the Church was embarrassed by its wealth in contrast to the poor. This, according to Spoto, began a literary tradition from which the popular legend of children originated. This idea closely follows H. E. Mayer.

===Revisionism===
The Dutch historian Peter Raedts, in a study published in 1977, was the first to cast doubt on the traditional narrative of these events. Many historians came to believe that they were not (or not primarily) children, but multiple bands of "wandering poor" in Germany and France. A number of them tried to reach the Holy Land but others never intended to do so. Early accounts of events, of which there are many variations told over the centuries, are, according to this theory, largely [[apocryphal]].{{clarify|date=October 2012|reason=See talk page}}&lt;ref name="raedts"&gt;{{cite journal | last = Raedts | first = P | title = The Children's Crusade of 1213 | journal = Journal of Medieval History | volume = 3 | year = 1977|doi=10.1016/0304-4181(77)90026-4 | pages=279–323}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="russel"&gt;Russell, Oswald, "Children's Crusade", ''[[Dictionary of the Middle Ages]]'', 1989&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Chorale''' is the name of several related [[musical form]]s originating in the [[music genre]] of the [[Lutheran chorale]]:
* [[Hymn tune]] of a [[Lutheran hymn]] (e.g. the melody of "[[Wachet auf, ruft uns die Stimme]]"), or a tune in a similar format (e.g. one of the themes in the Finale of [[Symphony No. 3 (Saint-Saëns)|Saint-Saëns's Third Symphony]]) 
* Such tune with a [[harmony|harmonic]] accompaniment (e.g. [[chorale monody]], chorales included in ''[[Schemellis Gesangbuch]]'')
* Such a tune presented in a [[homophony|homophonic]] or [[homorhythm|homorhythmic]] harmonisation, usually [[four-part harmony]] (e.g. [[List of chorales of Johann Sebastian Bach|Bach's four-part chorales]], or the chorale included in the second movement of [[Symphony No. 5 (Mahler)|Mahler's Fifth Symphony]])
* A more complex setting of a hymn(-like) tune (e.g. [[chorale fantasia]] form in [[Johann Sebastian Bach|Bach]]'s ''[[Schübler Chorales]]'', or a combination of compositional techniques in [[César Franck]]'s ''{{ill|Three Chorales|fr|Trois chorals}}'')

The chorale originated when [[Martin Luther]] forked sacred songs in vernacular language from established practices of church music near the end of the first quarter of the 16th century. The first hymnals according to Luther's new practice were published in 1524. Luther and his followers not only wrote [[metre (hymn)|metrical hymn lyrics]], but also composed [[metre (music)|metrical musical settings]] for these texts. This music was partially based on established melodies of church hymns and known secular songs. In the 17th century the repertoire was enriched with more [[choir|choral]] and [[pipe organ|organ]] settings of the chorale tunes. By the end of the century a four-part setting for [[SATB]] voices had become the standard for the choral settings, while the congregational singing of chorales was verging towards [[monody]] with an instrumental accompaniment. The prolific creation of new Lutheran chorale tunes ended around the same time.

After the introduction in Lutheran churches, in the early 18th century, of the [[cantata]] genre, originally only consisting of [[recitatives]] and [[aria]]s, the format was soon expanded with choral movements in the form of four-part chorales. Composers such as [[Johann Sebastian Bach]] and [[Gottfried Heinrich Stölzel]] placed these chorales often as a concluding movement at the end of their church compositions. The chorale as conclusion was emulated in more secular genres such as [[Romantic music|Romantic]] 19th-century symphonies. Other composers of that era, such as Franck, expanded the repertoire of the organ chorales, also emulating what late [[Baroque music|Baroque]] composers such as Bach had produced more than a century before. Entirely new chorale compositions became rare after the Romantic era, but by that time the four-part harmonisation technique, as exemplified in four-part chorales, had become part of the canon of Western music.
&lt;!--
Originally choral settings of [[Lutheran hymn]] tunes, and later also several instrumental genres, e.g. organ pieces from around the 17th century, and pieces for orchestra or piano from around the 19th century.

Essential characteristics of a chorale:
# Text: metric Lutheran hymn
# Metric tune or melody associated with the hymn text
# Homophonic part-setting (mostly [[four-part harmony]] for [[SATB]]) of text and melody
Later chorales not necessarily combine all of these characteristics, e.g.:
* only a known hymn tune in baroque organ chorales, or even only a chorale-like tune (not associated to any text) in late Romantic organ chorales

In [[German language|German]], the word {{lang|de|Choral}} may as well refer to [[Protestantism|Protestant]] congregational singing as to other forms of vocal (church) music, including [[Gregorian chant]].{{sfn|Praßl|2001}} The English word which derived from this German term, that is ''chorale'', however almost exclusively refers to the musical forms that originated in the German [[Reformation]].{{sfn|Parry|Martineau|1900}}

--&gt;
The bulk of Lutheran hymn texts and chorale melodies was created before the end of the 17th century.{{sfn|Parry|Martineau|1900}}

[[Johann Pachelbel]]'s ''[[Erster Theil etlicher Choräle]]'', a set of organ chorales, was published in the last decade of the 17th century. [[Johann Sebastian Bach]]'s earliest extant compositions, works for organ which he possibly wrote before his fifteenth birthday, include the chorales [[BWV&amp;nbsp;700]], [[BWV 724|724]], [[Neumeister Chorales|1091, 1094, 1097, 1112, 1113 and 1119]].&lt;ref&gt;Works {{BDW|0820}}, {{BDW|0847}}, {{BDW|1277}}, {{BDW|1280}}, {{BDW|1283}}, {{BDW|1298}}, {{BDW|1299}} and {{BDW|1305}} at [[Bach Digital]] website&lt;/ref&gt;

===18th century===
In the early 18th century [[Erdmann Neumeister]] introduced the [[cantata]] format, originally consisting exclusively of [[recitative]]s and [[aria]]s, in Lutheran liturgical music. Within a few years, the format was combined with other pre-existing liturgical formats such as the [[chorale concerto]], resulting in [[church cantata]]s that consisted of free poetry, for instance used in recitatives and arias, [[dictum (music)|dicta]] and/or hymn-based movements: the ''[[Sonntags- und Fest-Andachten]]'' cantata libretto cycle, published in [[Meiningen]] in 1704, contained such extended cantata texts. The [[chorale cantata]], called ''per omnes versus'' (through all verses) when its libretto was an entire unmodified Lutheran hymn, was also a format modernised from earlier types. [[Dieterich Buxtehude]] composed six ''per omnes versus'' chorale settings.{{sfn|Zager|2006|pages=[https://books.google.com/books?id=GeT9AAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA38 38ff.]}} [[BWV&amp;nbsp;4]], an [[Bach's early cantatas|early Bach-cantata]] composed in 1707, is in this same format. Later, for [[Bach's second cantata cycle|his 1720s second cantata cycle]], [[Bach's chorale cantata format|Bach developed a chorale cantata format]] where the inner movements paraphrased (rather than quoted) text of the inner verses of the hymn on which the cantata was based.

Each of the Meiningen cantata librettos contained a single chorale-based movement, on which it ended. Composers of the first half of the 18th century, such as Bach, [[Gottfried Heinrich Stölzel|Stölzel]] and [[Georg Philipp Telemann]], often closed a cantata with a four-part chorale setting, whether or not the libretto of the cantata already contained verses of a Lutheran hymn. Bach set several of the Meiningen librettos in 1726, and Stölzel expanded the librettos of [[Benjamin Schmolck]]'s ''Saitenspiel'' cycle with a closing chorale for each half cantata, when [[Gottfried Heinrich Stölzel#Church cantatas|he set that cycle in the early 1720s]]. Two of such closing chorales by Telemann inadvertently ended up in the ''[[Bach-Werke-Verzeichnis]]'' (BWV): the fifth movements of the cantatas [[BWV&amp;nbsp;218]] and [[BWV 219|219]], in the [[Telemann-Werke-Verzeichnis|catalogue of Telemann's vocal works]] adopted as Nos. 1:634/5 and 1:1328/5 respectively. These closing chorales almost always conformed to these formal characteristics:
* text consisting of one, or more exceptionally two, stanzas of a Lutheran hymn
* chorale tune sung by the highest voice
* homophonic text setting
* [[four-part harmony]], for [[SATB]] vocalists
* [[colla parte]] instrumentation, including [[basso continuo|continuo]]
Around 400 of such settings by Bach are known, with the colla parte instrumentation surviving for more than half of them. They do not only appear as closing movements of church cantatas: they can appear in other places in cantatas, even, exceptionally, opening a cantata ([[BWV 80b]]). Bach's [[Jesu, meine Freude, BWV 227|''Jesu, meine Freude'' motet]] contains several such chorales. Larger-scale compositions, such as [[Passion (music)|Passion]]s and [[oratorio]]s, often contain multiple four-part chorale settings which in part define the composition's structure: for instance in Bach's ''[[St John Passion|St John]]'' and ''[[St Matthew Passion|St Matthew]]'' Passions they often close units (scenes) before a next part of the narrative follows, and in the ''[[Wer ist der, so von Edom kömmt]]'' Passion [[pasticcio]] the narrative is carried by interspersed four-part chorale settings of nearly all stanzas of the "[[Christus, der uns selig macht]]" hymn.

Vocal church music of this period also contained other types of chorale settings, the general format of which is indicated as [[chorale fantasia]]: one voice, not necessarily the voice with the highest pitch, carries the chorale tune, with the other voices rather [[counterpoint|contrapuntal]] than homorhythmic, often with other melodies than the chorale tune, and instrumental interludes between the singing. For instance, the four cantatas with which Bach opened his second cantata cycle each start with a choral movement in chorale fantasia format, where the chorale tune is respectively sung by the soprano ([[BWV&amp;nbsp;20]], 11&amp;nbsp;June 1724), alto ([[BWV&amp;nbsp;2]], 18&amp;nbsp;June 1724), tenor ([[BWV&amp;nbsp;7]], 24&amp;nbsp;June 1724) and bass ([[BWV&amp;nbsp;135]], 25&amp;nbsp;June 1724) voices. Chorale fantasia settings are not necessarily choral movements: for instance, the fifth movement of the cantata [[BWV&amp;nbsp;10]] is a duet for alto and tenor voices in that format. Quarter of a century after Bach had composed that duet, he published it in an arrangement for organ, as fourth of the ''[[Schübler Chorales]]'', showing that the chorale fantasia format adapts itself very well to purely instrumental genres such as the [[chorale prelude]] for organ. Around 200 of Bach's chorale preludes are extant, many of them in the chorale fantasia format (others are fugues, or homorhythmic settings).

In the first half of the 18th century, chorales also appear in {{lang|de|[[Hausmusik]]}} (music performance in family circle), e.g. [[BWV&amp;nbsp;299]] in ''[[Notebook for Anna Magdalena Bach]]'', and/or are used for didactical purposes, e.g. [[BWV&amp;nbsp;691]] in the {{lang|de|[[Klavierbüchlein für Wilhelm Friedemann Bach]]}}.
&lt;!--
Bach etc:
* Chorale movements in cantatas (also Passions, Oratorios): Meiningen, Stölzel, ...
* Other ''figuraliter'' settings of hymn tunes: chorale fantasia; stand-alone chorales (e.g. Bach's ''Three Wedding Chorales'')
* Further development of organ chorale
* Hausmusik, e.g. Anna Magdalena Notebook

Congregational singing (i.e. ''choraliter'', as opposed to ''figuraliter'') however moves toward monodic singing of the chorale melody, with an instrumental accompaniment for the harmony; less hymn tunes used: texts with a similar metre scheme can be sung to a better-known melody.
--&gt;
Most of [[List of chorales of Johann Sebastian Bach|Bach's four-part chorales]], around 370 of them, were published for the first time between 1765 and 1787: it were the only works by the composer that were published between ''[[The Art of Fugue]]'' (1751) and the 50th anniversary of the composer's death in 1800.&lt;ref&gt;{{IMSLP|work=Chorale Harmonisations, BWV 1-438 (Bach, Johann Sebastian)|cname=Chorale Harmonisations, BWV 1-438, by Johann Sebastian Bach}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the late 18th century [[symphony|symphonies]] could include a chorale movement: for instance the third movement of [[Joseph Martin Kraus]]'s 1792 ''Symphonie funèbre'' is a chorale on (the Swedish version of) "[[Nun lasst uns den Leib begraben]]".{{sfn|Will|2002|page=[https://books.google.com/books?id=Wp_z2jsDZkQC&amp;pg=PA219 219]}}

===19th century===
Early in the 19th century [[Ludwig van Beethoven]] chose a chorale-like ending for [[Symphony No. 6 (Beethoven)|his Sixth Symphony]] (1808).{{sfn|Horton|2013|page=[https://books.google.com/books?id=TQv3AQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA341 341]}} Chorale analogies are even stronger in the choral finale of [[Symphony No. 9 (Beethoven)|his Ninth Symphony]] (1824).{{sfn|Horton|2013|page=[https://books.google.com/books?id=TQv3AQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA341 341]}}{{sfn|Brown|2002|page=[https://books.google.com/books?id=gCuXB45P-_IC&amp;pg=PA674 674]}} [[Felix Mendelssohn]], champion of the 19th-century [[Bach Revival]], included a chorale ("[[Ein feste Burg ist unser Gott]]") in the finale of his ''[[Reformation Symphony]]'' (1830).{{sfn|Horton|2013|page=[https://books.google.com/books?id=TQv3AQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA341 341]}} His first oratorio, ''[[St. Paul (oratorio)|Paulus]]'', which premièred in 1836, featured chorales such as "[[Allein Gott in der Höh sei Ehr]]" and "[[Wachet auf, ruft uns die Stimme]]". His ''[[Lobgesang]]'' Symphony-Cantata (1840) contained a movement based on the Lutheran chorale "[[Nun danket alle Gott]]".{{sfn|Horton|2013|page=[https://books.google.com/books?id=TQv3AQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA341 341]}} Lutheran hymns also appear in [[List of compositions by Felix Mendelssohn#Chorale cantatas|the composer's chorale cantatas]], some of his organ compositions, and the sketches of his unfinished [[Christus (Mendelssohn)|''Christus'' oratorio]].

In the first half of the 19th century, chorale-like symphony finales were also composed by [[Louis Spohr]] ("[[Begrabt den Leib in seiner Gruft]]" concludes his 1832 Fourth Symphony, named ''[[Die Weihe der Töne]]''), [[Niels Gade]] (Second Symphony, 1843) and others.{{sfn|Horton|2013|page=[https://books.google.com/books?id=TQv3AQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA341 341]}} [[Otto Nicolai]] wrote [[concert overture]]s on "[[Vom Himmel hoch, da komm ich her]]" (''Christmas Overture'', 1833) and on ""Ein feste Burg ist unser Gott"" (''Ecclesiastical Festival Overture'', 1844).{{sfn|Schletterer|1886}} [[Giacomo Meyerbeer]] set "Ad nos, ad salutarem undam" to a chorale melody of his own invention in his 1849 opera ''[[Le prophète]]''. The chorale tune was the basis for [[Franz Liszt]]'s organ composition [[Fantasy and Fugue on the chorale "Ad nos, ad salutarem undam"]] (1850).

[[Joachim Raff]] included Luther's "Ein feste Burg ist unser Gott" in his Overture [[opus number|Op.]]&amp;nbsp;127 (1854, revised 1865) and had his [[Symphony No. 5 (Raff)|Fifth Symphony (''Lenore'', Op.&amp;nbsp;177, 1872)]] end on a chorale.{{sfn|Leichtling|2009}}{{sfn|Horton|2013|page=[https://books.google.com/books?id=TQv3AQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA341 341]}} The Finale of [[Camille Saint-Saëns]]'s {{ill|Symphony No. 1 (Saint-Saëns)|fr|Symphonie nº 1 de Saint-Saëns|lt=1855 First Symphony}} contains a homorhythmic chorale.{{sfn|Horton|2013|page=[https://books.google.com/books?id=TQv3AQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA341 341]}} One of the themes in the Finale of his [[Symphony No. 3 (Saint-Saëns)|1886 Third Symphony]], that is the theme that was adopted in the 1978 "[[If&amp;nbsp;I&amp;nbsp;Had Words]]" song, is a chorale.{{sfn|Horton|2013|page=[https://books.google.com/books?id=TQv3AQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA341 341]}}{{sfn|Finscher|2016|page=[https://books.google.com/books?id=VOLOCwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA107 107]}} [[Anton Bruckner]]'s [[Symphony No. 3 (Bruckner)|1873 Third Symphony]] and his [[Symphony No. 5 (Bruckner)|1876 Fifth Symphony]] both end on a chorale played by [[brass instrument]]s.{{sfn|Horton|2013|page=[https://books.google.com/books?id=TQv3AQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA341 341]}} Bruckner also used the chorale as a compositional device in [[Two Aequali (Bruckner)|Two Aequali]].{{sfn|Harten|1996|page=44–45}} Further, he included chorales in [[Masses (Bruckner)|masses]] and [[Motets (Bruckner)|motets]] (e.g. ''[[Dir, Herr, dir will ich mich ergeben]]'', ''[[In jener letzten der Nächte]]''), and in part 7 of his [[Festive Cantata (Bruckner)|festive cantata ''Preiset den Herrn'']].{{sfn|van Zwol|2012|pages=701–703}} In his [[Psalm 22 (Bruckner)|setting of Psalm 22]] and in the Finale of his Fifth Symphony he used a chorale in contrast to and combination with a [[fugue]].&lt;ref&gt;Carragan, William. n.d.

In 1881 [[Sergei Taneyev]] described chorale harmonisations, such as those ending Bach's cantatas, rather as a necessary evil: inartistic, but unavoidable, even in Russian church music.&lt;ref&gt;Jopi Harri. [http://ecmr.fi/Scanned_Books_etc/AnnalesB340Harri.pdf ''St. Petersburg Court Chant and the Tradition of Eastern Slavic Church Singing''.] Finland: University of Turku (2011), p. 23–24&lt;/ref&gt; From the 1880s [[Ferruccio Busoni]] was adopting chorales in his instrumental compositions, often adapted from or inspired by models by Johann Sebastian Bach: for example [[Busoni-Verzeichnis|BV]]&amp;nbsp;186 ({{circa|1881}}), an introduction and fugue on "Herzliebster Jesu was hast verbrochen", No.&amp;nbsp;3 of Bach's ''[[St Matthew Passion]]''. In 1897 he transcribed Liszt's Fantasy and Fugue on the chorale "Ad nos, ad salutarem undam" for piano. [[César Franck]] emulated the chorale in compositions for piano (''[[Prélude, Choral et Fugue (Franck)|Prélude, Choral et Fugue]]'', 1884) and for organ (''{{ill|Trois chorals|fr}}'', 1990). [[Johannes Zahn]] published an index and classification of all known [[Evangelicalism|Evangelical]] hymn tunes in six volumes from 1889 to 1893.{{sfn|Zahn|1889–1893}}

A chorale-like theme appears throughout the last movement of [[Gustav Mahler]]'s [[Symphony No. 3 (Mahler)|Third Symphony (1896)]]:{{sfn|Horton|2013|page=[https://books.google.com/books?id=TQv3AQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA341 341]}}

In [[Symphony No. 5 (Mahler)|his Fifth Symphony]], the first version of which was composed 1901–1902, Gustav Mahler included a chorale near the end of Part&amp;nbsp;I (2nd&amp;nbsp;movement).{{sfn|Roman|1981}} The chorale melody reappears in a transformed version in the last movement of the symphony (Part&amp;nbsp;III, 5th&amp;nbsp;movement).{{sfn|Roman|1981}} Shortly after Mahler had completed the symphony, [[Alma Mahler|his wife Alma]] reproached him to have included a dreary church-like chorale in the work.{{sfn|Floros|1981|page = 3}} Mahler replied that Bruckner had included chorales in his symphonies, to which she replied "''Der'' darf, du nicht!" (''He'' [Bruckner] can do that, you shouldn't).{{sfn|Floros|1981|page = 3}} In her memoir, she continues that she then tried to convince her husband that his strength lay elsewhere than in the adoption of churchy chorales in his music.{{sfn|Floros|1981|page = 3}}

Busoni continued to compose Bach-inspired chorales in the 20th century, for instance including chorale subsections in his ''[[Fantasia contrappuntistica]]'' (1910s). ''[[Sports et divertissements]]'', written by [[Erik Satie]] in 1914, opens with "Choral inappétissant" (unsavoury chorale), in which the composer put, according to his preface, everything he knew about tedium, and which he dedicated to all who disliked him.{{sfn|Satie|1914}} As with much of Satie's music, it was written down without metre.

[[Igor Stravinsky]] included chorales in some of his compositions: among others, a "Little Chorale" and a "Great Chorale" in his ''[[L'Histoire du soldat]]'' (1918) and a chorale concluding his ''[[Symphonies of Wind Instruments]]'' (1920, rev. 1947).{{sfn|Smyth|Traut|2011}}{{sfn|Somfai|1972}}{{sfn|Perry|1993–1994}}{{sfn|Straus|1997}} Chorales appear in [[Olivier Messiaen]]'s music, for instance in ''{{ill|Un vitrail et des oiseaux|fr}}'' (1986–1988) and ''La ville d'en haut'' (1989), two late {{ill|List of compositions for piano by Olivier Messiaen|fr|Liste des œuvres d'Olivier Messiaen#Piano|lt=works for piano and orchestra}}.{{sfn|Cheong|2010}}{{sfn|Dingle|1995}}{{sfn|Dingle|2013|page=[https://books.google.com/books?id=K2ebDUfcZwQC&amp;pg=PR12 xii]}}

Stand-alone orchestral chorales were adapted from works by Johann Sebastian Bach: for instance [[Leopold Stokowski]] orchestrated, among other similar pieces, the sacred song [[BWV&amp;nbsp;478]] and the fourth movement of the cantata [[BWV&amp;nbsp;4]] as chorales ''Komm, süsser Tod'' (recorded 1933) and ''Jesus Christus, Gottes Sohn'' (recorded 1937) respectively.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.stokowski.org/Stokowski_Philadelphia_Electrical_Discography.htm  Leopold Stokowski - Philadelphia Orchestra: Chronological Discography of Electrical Recordings 1925-1940] at {{url|www.stokowski.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; Recordings of all of Bach's chorales—vocal as well as instrumental—appeared in the three complete works box sets that were issued around the 250th anniversary of the composer's death in 2000.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.musicweb-international.com/classrev/2001/Dec01/BrilliantBach.htm "Bach Edition"] at {{url|http://www.musicweb-international.com}} 1 December 2001&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Teldec]]'s 1999 [https://www.amazon.com/Bach-2000-Johann-Sebastian/dp/B00001IV8B Bach 2000 Box set, Limited Edition] at {{url|www.amazon.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.haenssler-classic.de/en/series-and-editions/johann-sebastian-bach-edition/the-complete-works/the-complete-cd-edition.html Bach-Edition: The Complete Works (172 CDs &amp; CDR)] at the [[Hänssler Classic]] website: {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150929224617/http://www.haenssler-classic.de/en/series-and-editions/johann-sebastian-bach-edition/the-complete-works/the-complete-cd-edition.html |date=29 September 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Types==
{{incomplete section|date=October 2017}}
&lt;!--
Originally choral music, later also diverse types of instrumental music
--&gt;

Chorale melodies are often in [[Bar form]], that is, consisting of a repeated first phrase, called {{lang|de|Stollen}}, and a concluding second phrase. The harmonisation of such a chorale melody may repeat the same harmonisation for both passes of the {{lang|de|Stollen}}, or may present a variant harmonisation on the second pass of the first phrase of the melody.

===Vocal===
&lt;!--
Archetype: four-part harmony, [[SATB]], homophony
--&gt;
====Part song====
[[File:Bach Matthäuspassion O Haupt voll Blut und Wunden.jpg|thumb|upright=1.35|Bach's four-part chorale setting of "[[O Haupt voll Blut und Wunden]]"]]
Hymnals:
* Melody in tenor part, three- to five-part settings, e.g. ''[[Eyn geystlich Gesangk Buchleyn]]'' (Walter 1524)
* Four- to six-part settings, with thorough bass accompaniment, e.g. ''[[Neu Leipziger Gesangbuch]]'' (Vopelius 1682)

Collections, e.g. [[List of chorale harmonisations by Johann Sebastian Bach|Bach's four-part chorale editions]]

''Colla parte'' accompaniment, e.g. closing chorales of Bach-cantatas

====Elaborate choral settings====
[[Chorale fantasia]], e.g. opening movement of ''[[St Matthew Passion]]'' (in English rather called Chorus than Chorale)

====Monodic with instrumental accompaniment====
Voice and continuo, e.g. ''[[Schemellis Gesangbuch]]'' (1736) – rather called ''Lied'' in German

===Instrumental===
In instrumental chorale settings, as well emulations of four-part homophony, as chorale fantasia type of approaches exist.

Originally ''Choralbearbeitung'', i.e. setting of a pre-existing chorale melody

====Organ====
Chorale preludes, e.g. ''[[Erster Theil etlicher Choräle]]'' (Pachelbel), ''[[Clavier-Übung III]]'' (Bach)

Not based on pre-existing hymn tunes, e.g. César Franck's ''Trois chorals''

====Orchestra====
In symphonies, e.g. Mendelssohn, Saint-Saëns, Mahler

====Other====
Chorales for solo piano are included in, for instance, Franck's ''Prélude, Choral et Fugue'' (1884), Satie's ''Sports et divertissements'' (1914, published {{circa|1923}}), and Busoni's ''Fantasia contrappuntistica'' (multiple versions, early 1910s). That last composition also exists in the composer's arrangement for two pianos (early 1920s).

Molina]], [[Jody Williams]], [[Daniel Kahneman]] and [[Paul Krugman]]; researchers [[Robert Sapolsky]], [[Steven Pinker]], [[Eduard Punset]], [[Clotaire Rapaille]], [[Tim Berners-Lee]], [[David Buss]], [[Richard Dawkins]], [[Michael Shermer]], [[Craig Venter]] and [[Randi Zuckerberg]]; and Oscar nominees [[PES (director)|Adame Pesapane (PES)]] and [[Oliver Stone]].

Since 2008, up to 3,600 attendees have gathered every November in the center of [[Puebla, Puebla|Puebla]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Mariana Fernández|url= http://www.milenio.com/cdb/doc/impreso/8032945|title= Announce Festival Ciudad de las Ideas (Anuncian el festival La Ciudad de las Ideas)|date=12 March 2008|accessdate=1 July 2013|publisher=[[Milenio]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Monitoring Report of Press and Public Relations (statistical) granted by The Crossing.

The festival has been promoted in [[Azteca Trece]] and [[Proyecto 40]] and on the event's website, social media, and through a science bookstore located at the festival site.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Proyecto 40|url=http://www.proyecto40.com/?s=videoenvivo|title=Proyecto 40.

Since June 9, 2008, over 231 festival speakers have had their presentations published online. Fifty percent of the audience are between 16 and 25 years old.

== History ==

===2008: Cynosura===
The first conference took place in Puebla’s Convention Center in 2008. Its name is derived from the star [[Polaris]], also named ''Cynosura'' by the Greeks, pertaining to the [[Ursa Minor]] constellation. ''Cynosura'' took place from the 6th to 8 November, with the speakers allotted 21 minutes to present. The conference commemorated the 100-year anniversary of the scandal caused by the String Quartet No.2 in F Sharp Minor by Austrian composter, [[Arnold Schoenberg]], with the atonality that disrupted traditional classic music.

===2009: Re-evolution===
[[File:Christopher Hitchens, Sam Harris y Daniel Dennett en CDI 2009.jpg|thumb|Christopher Hitchens, Sam Harris and Daniel Dennett at Ciudad de las Ideas 2009. Re-evolution]]
From 2009 onwards, the University’s Cultural Complex of the [[BUAP|Meritorious Autonomous University of Puebla]] became the International Brilliant Minds Festival’s official venue. La Ciudad de las Ideas celebrated the [[International Year of Astronomy]] with a "night of telescopes" and, from 2009 to 2012, innovative ideas in science and humanities were acknowledged with the ''Innovation for Humanity'' Prize and the ''Entrepreneur for Humanity'' Prize.

The winners of the ''Innovation for Humanity'' Prize in 2008 were Daniel Dennett and Steven Pinker, while the ''Entrepreneur for Humanity'' Prize acknowledged nearly 300 individuals.

===2010: The origins of the future===
In 2010, CDI commemorated two historical events relevant to Mexico: the [[Bicentennial of Mexico|Bicentennial Independence Day Anniversary]] and the [[Centennial of the Mexican Revolution|Centennial Anniversary of the Mexican Revolution]]. The 2010 edition took place in the University Cultural Complex at the Meritorious Autonomous University of Puebla from the 11th to 13 November, where over 33 speakers attended.

The winners of the ''Innovation for Humanity'' Prize in 2009 were [[Dan Ariely]] and [[Philip Zimbardo]], and the ''Entrepreneur for Humanity'' Prize acknowledged 200 individuals.

===2011: Reset===
This edition of CDI took place from the 10th to 12 November 2011 in the University Cultural Complex at the [[BUAP|Meritorious Autonomous University of Puebla]]. As in 2009, the "night of telescopes" took place on Friday the 11th at 7pm.

The winners of the ''Innovation for Humanity'' Prize in 2010 were [[Michio Kaku]] and [[Richard Dawkins]]. The ''Entrepreneur for Humanity'' Prize was awarded to 120 individuals.

===2012: The Magic of If===
[[File:CDI 2012. Magic of if..JPG|thumb|Ciudad de las Ideas 2012. Magic of if]]
The fifth edition of the festival was titled "The Magic of If". This edition took place from the 8th to 10 November 2012 in the University Cultural Complex at the [[BUAP|Meritorious Autonomous University of Puebla]]. It included a new section dedicated to Mexican talent, called "Mex-I-can" and, on the other hand, the time for speakers to present reduced from 21 to 12 minutes.

The winners of the Innovation for Humanity Prize in 2011 were [[Eduard Punset]], [[Oliver Stone]] and [[Dambisa Moyo]]. For the 2012 edition, the ''Entrepreneur for Humanity'' Prize was transformed into a prize with great reach and significance, turning into an initiative that stimulates social [[entrepreneurship]] projects, called ''Gifted Citizen Prize''.

===2013: Dangerous Ideas===
The festival's sixth edition took place from 7 to 9 November 2013, with the title of "Dangerous Ideas". Ciudad de las Ideas 2013 also took place in the University Cultural Complex at the [[BUAP|Meritorious Autonomous University of Puebla]] and includes a new curatorial topic, "W-Under 18" that invited children and youth that are changing the world, like [[Jack Andraka]], [[Boyan Slat]], and [[Umi Garrett]].

== Gifted Citizen Initiative ==
[[File:Comunidad GZ.JPG|thumb|Comunidad Gifted Citizen en 2012]]
This initiative began at La Ciudad de las Ideas 2012. Submitted projects are evaluated by a committee and the conference Board of Directors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Poder Cívico|url=http://www.ciudaddelasideas.com/giftedcitizen|title=Gifted Citizen|date=|accessdate=18 September 2013|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The projects can be scientific, technological, social, ecological or artistic in nature, as well as concerning development or human rights. The most outstanding project is awarded [[United States dollar|US$]]100,000. This prize is given in association with the [[Singularity University]]. Furthermore, the prize is backed up with the help of sponsors like [[Comex Group|Comex]], [[Grupo Salinas]], [[Aeroméxico]], and the State of Puebla Government.

The GZ Prize was known as the "Entrepreneur for Humanity Prize" in the 2009, 2010 and 2011 conferences.

In Britain in the era 1680–1740, especially in the days of [[Robert Walpole]] (1720s to 1740s), the '''country Party''' was a coalition of [[Tories]] and disaffected [[Whig (British political party)|Whigs]]. It was a movement rather than an organised party and had no formal structure or leaders. It claimed to be a nonpartisan force fighting for the nation's interest—the whole "country"—against the self-interested actions of the '''court party''', that is the politicians in power in London. Country men believed the court party was corrupting Britain by using [[patronage]] to buy support and was threatening English and Scottish liberties and the proper balance of authority by shifting power from Parliament to the prime minister. It sought to constrain the court by opposing standing armies, calling for annual elections to Parliament (instead of the seven-year term in effect), and wanted to fix power in the hands of the [[landed gentry]] rather than the royal officials, urban merchants or bankers. It opposed any practices it saw as corruption.

The Country Party attracted a number of influential writers (such as [[Jonathan Swift]], [[Samuel Johnson]], and [[Andrew Fletcher of Saltoun]]) and political theorists.  The ideology of the party faded away in England but became a powerful force in the [[Thirteen Colonies|American colonies]], where its tracts strongly motivated the [[Patriot (American Revolution)|Patriots]] to oppose what the country party had cast as British monarchical tyranny and to develop a powerful political philosophy of [[republicanism in the United States]].&lt;ref&gt;See Bernard Bailyn, ''The Ideological Origins of the American Revolution'' (1967); Gordon S. Wood, ''The Creation of the American Republic'' (1969); and J.G.A. Pocock, ''The Machiavellian Moment: Florentine  Political Thought and the Atlantic Republican Tradition'' (1975). &lt;/ref&gt;

Historically, the name "country party" was used by what became the Whig Party itself in its initial stages, when headed by the [[Anthony Ashley Cooper, 1st Earl of Shaftesbury|Earl of Shaftesbury]] during the [[Exclusion Crisis]] of 1679-1681. Then, the term "[[Whiggamore Raid|whiggamor]]", shortened to "Whig", started being applied to the party - first as a pejorative term, then adopted and taken up by the party itself. The name "country party" was thus discarded - to be taken up later by opponents of the Whig Party itself, once it had come to dominate British politics following the [[Glorious Revolution]]. 

==Country persuasion==
{{See also|Patriot Whigs|The Craftsman (newspaper)}}
The historian Hoppit has interpreted that around 1700 instead of a country "party", the English electorate, its Lords and its elected representatives had a country persuasion with key consensus demands that the government should be frugal and efficient, opposition to high taxes, a concern for personal liberty, a quest for more frequent elections, a faith that the local militia would substitute for a dangerous standing army, a desire for such moral reforms as temperance in an age of drunkenness, and less Sabbath breaking. The country leaders stressed the civic duty of the upper class to engage in politics to strengthen the national interest.&lt;ref&gt;Julian Hoppit, ''A Land of Liberty?: England 1689–1727'' (2000) p. 159&lt;/ref&gt;  Such views amount to the main counter to extreme [[High Tory]] [[hegemony]] and the similar [[wikt:bigwig|bigwig]] [[Whigs (British political party)|Whig Party]] [[Cabal ministry|cabal]] which in its estimation morphed via other executives into the [[Robert Walpole|Walpole executive]] [[wikt:placeman|placemen]].

==Bolingbroke==
[[Henry St John, 1st Viscount Bolingbroke]] was especially influential in stating the need and outlining the machinery of a systematic [[parliamentary opposition]]. Such an opposition he called a "country party" which he opposed to the court party. Country parties had been formed before, for instance after the king's speech to Parliament in November 1685, but Bolingbroke was the first to state the need for a continual opposition to the government. To his mind the spirit of liberty was threatened by the court party's lust for power.&lt;ref&gt;Caroline Robbins, "'Discordant Parties": A Study of the Acceptance of Party by Englishmen,'" ''Political Science Quarterly'' Vol. 73, No. 4 (Dec. 1958), pp. 505–529 [https://www.jstor.org/stable/2146028 in JSTOR]&lt;/ref&gt;

Liberty could only be safeguarded by an opposition party that used "constitutional methods and a legal course of opposition to the excesses of legal and ministerial power…".&lt;ref&gt;Bolingbroke, ''On the Idea of a Patriot King'' p.&amp;nbsp;117&lt;/ref&gt; He instructed the opposition party to "Wrest the power of government, if you can, out of the hands that employed it weakly and wickedly"&lt;ref&gt;Bolingbroke, ''On the Spirit of Patriotism'' p.&amp;nbsp;42&lt;/ref&gt; This work could be done only by a homogeneous party "…because such a party alone will submit to a drudgery of this kind".&lt;ref&gt;Bolingbroke, ''On the idea of a Patriot King'' p.&amp;nbsp;170&lt;/ref&gt; It did not suffice to be eager to speak, keen to act. "They who affect to head an opposition, …, must be equal, at least, to those whom they oppose…".&lt;ref&gt;Bolingbroke, ''On the Spirit of Patriotism'' p.&amp;nbsp;58&lt;/ref&gt; The opposition had to be of a permanent nature to make sure that it would be looked at as a part of daily politics. It had to contrast, on every occasion, the government.&lt;ref&gt;Bolingbroke, ''On the Spirit of Patriotism'' p.&amp;nbsp;61&lt;/ref&gt; He considered a party that systematically opposed the government to be more appealing than a party that occasionally opposed the government. This opposition had to prepare itself to control government.&lt;ref&gt;Bolingbroke, ''On the Spirit of Patriotism'' pp.&amp;nbsp;61–3&lt;/ref&gt;

==Americans==
The writings of the country party were eagerly devoured by some American colonists who came to fear the corruption of the English court as the greatest threat to the colonies’ desired liberties. They formed a [[Patriot (American Revolution)|Patriot cause]] in the [[Thirteen Colonies]] and used the country party ideas to help form [[Republicanism in the United States]]. Hutson identified country ideology as a major influence on the [[Antifederalists]] during the debate over the [[ratification of the United States Constitution]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Hutson |first1=James H. |title=Country, Court, and Constitution: Antifederalism and the Historians |journal=The William and Mary Quarterly |date=July 1981 |volume=38 |issue=3 |pages=337–368 |jstor=1921952 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, [[Jeffersonian democracy|Jeffersonianism]] inherited the country party attack on elitism, centralization, and distant government during the ascent of [[Alexander Hamilton]] and other [[Federalists]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Wilson |first1=Clyde |title=American Populism and the Power of the State |url=http://www.theimaginativeconservative.org/2017/02/american-populism-power-state-clyde-wilson.html |website=theimaginativeconservative.org |publisher=The Imaginative Conservative}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Malcolm | year=1964 | location=Philadelphia | pages=221 | isbn=0-292-73500-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; is an [[United States|American]] [[folk ballad]].

==Story==
The story is a [[cautionary tale]] concerning a young girl called Charlotte who refused to wrap up warmly to go on a [[sleigh]] ride to a [[New Year|New Year's]] [[ball (dance)|ball]]. Upon arriving at the ball, her fiancé discovers that she has frozen to death during the journey.

==Origins==
The ballad of "Fair Charlotte" is based on a poem by [[Seba Smith]] that was first published in ''[[The Rover (newspaper)|The Rover]]'', a Maine newspaper, on December 28, 1843, under the title ''A Corpse Going To A Ball''.&lt;ref name=cohen&gt;Cohen, Norm: ''Folk Music: A Regional Exploration'', p. 24-25 (America, 2005) {{ISBN|0-313-32872-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to folklorist [[Phillips Barry]], Smith's composition was based on an incident recounted in an 1840 ''New York Observer'' article of the same name.{{sfn|Laws|1964|p=221}}. The story from the "New York Observer" &lt;ref&gt;[https://www.loc.gov/newspapers/?all=true&amp;dates=1830-1839&amp;fa=location:new+york+city%7Cpartof_title:new-york+observer.+%28new-york+:%29+1829-1912 The Library of Congress Card Catalogue of the "New York Observer" begins with this description of the newspaper:"This orthodox Presbyterian publication was begun in 1823 by Sidney E. and Richard Morse, brothers of the inventor Samuel Morse. Religious topics and viewpoints were the main focus of the newspaper, representing the conservative part of the Presbyterian church. Topics covered in the early part of the nineteenth century include "Religion the Only safe Basis of Popular Education," "On the Idolatry and Superstition of Popery," "Danger of Reading Infidel Writings," and "Why Is There a Hell?" …"]&lt;/ref&gt;was entitled "A Corpse Going To a Ball" and was reprinted in an Ohio Newspaper: "Ohio Democrat and Dover Advertiser" February 28, 1840 p. 1&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://chroniclingamerica.loc.gov/lccn/sn84028888/1840-02-28/ed-1/seq-1/|title=The Ohio Democrat and Dover advertiser.

'''Feng shui''' or '''fengshui''' ({{lang-zh|t=風水|s=风水|first=t}}, &lt;small&gt;pronounced&lt;/small&gt; {{IPAc-cmn|AUD|Zh-feng1shui3.ogg|f|eng|1|.|sh|ui|3}}), also known as '''Chinese [[geomancy]]''', is a [[pseudoscience]] originating from China, which claims to use energy forces to harmonize individuals with their surrounding environment.&lt;ref name=matthews/&gt; The term ''feng shui'' literally translates as "wind-water" in English. This is a cultural shorthand taken from the passage of the now-lost ''[[Classic of Burial]]'' recorded in [[Guo Pu]]'s [[Book of Burial|commentary]]:&lt;ref name="Field"&gt;{{cite web | last = Field | first = Stephen L. | authorlink = | coauthors = | title = ''The Zangshu, or Book of Burial''. | work = | publisher = | date = | url = http://fengshuigate.com/zangshu.html | doi = | accessdate = }}&lt;/ref&gt;
Feng shui is one of the Five Arts of Chinese Metaphysics, classified as [[physiognomy]] (observation of appearances through formulas and calculations). The feng shui practice discusses architecture in terms of "invisible forces" that bind the universe, earth, and humanity together, known as ''[[qi]]''.

Historically, feng shui was widely used to orient buildings—often spiritually significant structures such as tombs, but also dwellings and other structures—in an [[wikt:auspicious|auspicious]] manner. Depending on the particular style of feng shui being used, an auspicious site could be determined by reference to local features such as bodies of water, or stars or the compass.

==History==
===Origins===
{{As of | 2013}} the [[Yangshao culture|Yangshao]] and [[Hongshan culture]]s provide the earliest known evidence for the use of feng shui. Until the invention of the [[magnetic compass]], feng shui apparently relied on [[Chinese astronomy|astronomy]] to find correlations between humans and the universe.&lt;ref&gt;
Sun, X. (2000) Crossing the Boundaries between Heaven and Man: Astronomy in Ancient China. In H. Selin (ed.), ''Astronomy Across Cultures: The History of Non-Western Astronomy.'' 423–54. Kluwer Academic.
&lt;/ref&gt;
In 4000 BC, the doors of [[Banpo]] dwellings aligned with the [[Asterism (astronomy)|asterism]] ''Yingshi'' just after the [[winter solstice]]—this sited the homes for [[solar gain]].&lt;ref&gt;
David W. Pankenier. 'The Political Background of Heaven's Mandate.' ''Early China'' 20 (1995): 121-76.&lt;/ref&gt; During the [[Zhou Dynasty|Zhou]] era, ''Yingshi'' was known as ''Ding'' and used to indicate the appropriate time to build a capital city, according to the ''[[Shijing]]''. The late Yangshao site at [[Dadiwan]] (c. 3500–3000 BC) includes a palace-like building (F901) at the center. The building faces south and borders a large plaza. It stands on a north-south axis with another building that apparently housed communal activities. Regional communities may have used the complex.&lt;ref&gt;Li Liu. ''The Chinese Neolithic: Trajectories to Early States.'' Cambridge University Press (2004) 85–88.&lt;/ref&gt;

A grave at [[Puyang]] (around 4000 BC) that contains mosaics— actually a [[Chinese star map]] of the Dragon and Tiger asterisms and [[Big Dipper|Beidou]] ([[Dipper|the Big Dipper, Ladle or Bushel]])— is oriented along a north-south axis.&lt;ref&gt;Zhentao Xuastronomy. 2000: 2&lt;/ref&gt; The presence of both round and square shapes in the Puyang tomb, at Hongshan ceremonial centers and at the late Longshan settlement at Lutaigang,&lt;ref&gt;
Li Liu. ''The Chinese Neolithic: Trajectories to Early States.'' Cambridge University Press (2004) 248–249.
&lt;/ref&gt;
suggests that ''gaitian'' cosmography (heaven-round, earth-square) existed in Chinese society long before it appeared in the ''[[Zhoubi Suanjing]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Sarah M. Nelson, Rachel A. Matson, Rachel M. Roberts, Chris Rock and Robert E. Stencel. (2006) ''Archaeoastronomical Evidence for Wuism at the Hongshan Site of Niuheliang''. p. 2.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Cosmography]] that bears a striking resemblance to modern feng shui devices and formulas appears on a piece of jade unearthed at Hanshan and dated around 3000 BC. Archaeologist [[Li Xueqin]] links the design to the ''liuren'' [[astrolabe]], ''zhinan zhen'', and [[luopan]].&lt;ref&gt;Chen Jiujin and Zhang Jingguo. 'Hanshan chutu yupian tuxing shikao,' ''Wenwu'' 4, 1989:15&lt;/ref&gt;

Beginning with palatial structures at [[Erlitou]],&lt;ref&gt;
Li Liu. ''The Chinese Neolithic: Trajectories to Early States.'' Cambridge University Press (2004) 230–37.
&lt;/ref&gt;
all capital cities of China followed rules of feng shui for their design and layout. During the Zhou era, the ''Kaogong ji'' ({{lang-zh|t=考工記|s=考工记}}; "Manual of Crafts") codified these rules. The carpenter's manual ''Lu ban jing'' ({{lang-zh|t=魯班經|s=鲁班经}}; "Lu ban's manuscript") codified rules for builders. Graves and tombs also followed rules of feng shui, from [[Puyang]] to [[Mawangdui]] and beyond. From the earliest records, the structures of the graves and dwellings seem to have followed the same rules.

===Early instruments and techniques===
[[File:La-chinatown-spiral.jpg|thumb|A feng shui [[spiral]] at [[Chinatown, Los Angeles, California|LA Chinatown]]'s [[Los Angeles Metro Rail|Metro]] station]]
The history of feng shui covers 3,500+ years&lt;ref&gt;Aihe Wang. ''Cosmology and Political Culture in Early China.'' 2000: 55&lt;/ref&gt; before the invention of the magnetic compass. It originated in [[Chinese astronomy]].&lt;ref&gt;Feng Shi. Zhongguo zhaoqi xingxiangtu yanjiu. ''Zhiran kexueshi yanjiu,'' 2 (1990).&lt;/ref&gt; Some current techniques can be traced to [[Neolithic]] China,&lt;ref&gt;Aihe Wang. ''Cosmology and Political Culture in Early China.'' 2000: 54-55&lt;/ref&gt; while others were added later (most notably the [[Han Dynasty|Han]] dynasty, the [[Tang Dynasty|Tang]], the [[Song Dynasty|Song]], and the [[Ming Dynasty|Ming]]).&lt;ref&gt;Cheng Jian Jun and Adriana Fernandes-Gonçalves. ''Chinese Feng Shui Compass: Step by Step Guide.'' 1998: 21&lt;/ref&gt;

The astronomical history of feng shui is evident in the development of instruments and techniques. According to the ''Zhouli'', the original feng shui instrument may have been a ''[[gnomon]]''. Chinese used circumpolar stars to determine the north-south axis of settlements. This technique explains why Shang palaces at [[Yinxu|Xiaotun]] lie 10° east of due north. In some of the cases, as [[Paul Wheatley (geographer)|Paul Wheatley]] observed,&lt;ref&gt;''The Pivot of the Four Quarters'' (1971: 46)&lt;/ref&gt; they bisected the angle between the directions of the rising and setting sun to find north. This technique provided the more precise alignments of the Shang walls at [[Yanshi]] and [[Zhengzhou]]. Rituals for using a feng shui instrument required a diviner to examine current sky phenomena to set the device and adjust their position in relation to the device.&lt;ref&gt;Mark Edward Lewis (2006).'' The Construction of Space in Early China.'' p. 275&lt;/ref&gt;

The oldest examples of instruments used for feng shui are ''liuren'' astrolabes, also known as ''shi''. These consist of a [[lacquer]]ed, two-sided board with astronomical sightlines. The earliest examples of liuren astrolabes have been unearthed from tombs that date between 278 BC and 209 BC. Along with divination for [[Da Liu Ren]]&lt;ref&gt;Marc Kalinowski (1996). "The Use of the Twenty-eight Xiu as a Day-Count in Early China." Chinese Science 13 (1996): 55-81.&lt;/ref&gt; the boards were commonly used to chart the motion of [[Pole star|Taiyi]] through the nine palaces.&lt;ref&gt;Yin Difei. "Xi-Han Ruyinhou mu chutu de zhanpan he tianwen yiqi." ''Kaogu'' 1978.5, 338-43; Yan Dunjie, "Guanyu Xi-Han chuqi de shipan he zhanpan." ''Kaogu'' 1978.5, 334-37.&lt;/ref&gt; The markings on a ''liuren/shi'' and the first magnetic compasses are virtually identical.&lt;ref&gt;Marc Kalinowski. 'The ''Xingde'' Texts from [[Mawangdui]].' ''Early China.'' 23–24 (1998–99):125–202.&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[compass|magnetic compass]] was invented for feng shui&lt;ref&gt;Wallace H. Campbell. ''Earth Magnetism: A Guided Tour Through Magnetic Fields.'' Academic Press, 2001.&lt;/ref&gt; and has been in use since its invention. Traditional feng shui instrumentation consists of the [[loupan|Luopan]] or the earlier south-pointing spoon (指南針 ''zhinan zhen'')—though a conventional compass could suffice if one understood the differences. A feng shui ruler (a later invention) may also be employed.

==Foundational concepts==

=== Definition and classification ===
The goal of feng shui as practiced today is to situate the human-built environment on spots with good ''qi'', an imagined form of "energy". The "perfect spot" is a location and an axis in time.&lt;ref name="Qimancy: Chinese Divination by Qi"&gt;Field, Stephen L. (1998). [http://www.fengshuigate.com/qimancy.html Qimancy: Chinese Divination by Qi.] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170223065625/http://www.fengshuigate.com/qimancy.html |date=2017-02-23 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Bennett, Steven J. 1978"&gt;Bennett, Steven J. (1978) "Patterns of the Sky and Earth: A Chinese Science of Applied Cosmology." ''Journal of Chinese Science.'' 3:1–26&lt;/ref&gt;

Feng shui is not a science, but is classified as a [[pseudoscience]] since it exhibits a number of classic pseudoscientific aspects such as making claims about the functioning of the world which are not amenable to testing with the [[scientific method]].&lt;ref name=matthews&gt;{{cite book|author=Michael R. Matthews|title=History, Philosophy and Science Teaching: New Perspectives|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=_3IzDwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA31|date=30 August 2017|publisher=Springer|isbn=978-3-319-62616-1|page=31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===''Qi'' (''ch'i'')===
[[File:Lingshan Islamic Cemetery - turtle tomb - DSCF8492.JPG|thumb|A traditional [[turtle-back tombs|turtle-back tomb]] of southern [[Fujian]], surrounded by an [[omega]]-shaped ridge protecting it from the "noxious winds" from the three sides&lt;ref name=deGroot941&gt;{{citation

|url=https://archive.org/details/religioussystemo03groo |pages=941–42}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]
''[[Qi]]''（氣）(pronounced "chee" in English) is a movable positive or negative life force which plays an essential role in feng shui.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.instituteoffengshui.com/fengshui.html |title=Feng Shui |publisher=Institute of Feng Shui |date= |accessdate=2011-05-15 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110713043801/http://www.instituteoffengshui.com/fengshui.html |archivedate=2011-07-13 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; In feng shui as in [[Chinese martial arts]], it refers to 'energy', in the sense of 'life force' or ''[[élan vital]]''. A traditional explanation of ''qi'' as it relates to feng shui would include the orientation of a structure, its age, and its interaction with the surrounding environment, including the local [[microclimate]]s, the slope of the land, vegetation, and soil quality.{{citation needed|date=August 2009}}

Wu Yuanyin&lt;ref&gt;''Tsang ching chien chu (Tse ku chai chung ch'ao'', volume 76), p. 1a.&lt;/ref&gt; (Qing dynasty) said that vital ''qi'' was "congealed ''qi''", which is the state of ''qi'' that engenders life.

===Polarity===
[[wikt:polarity|Polarity]] is expressed in feng shui as [[yin and yang|''yin'' and ''yang'']] theory. Polarity expressed through ''yin'' and ''yang'' is similar to a [[magnetic dipole]]. That is, it is of two parts: one creating an exertion and one receiving the exertion. ''Yang'' acting and ''yin'' receiving could be considered an early understanding of [[Handedness|chirality]].{{clarify|date=October 2011}} The development of this theory and its corollary, [[Wu Xing|five phase theory (five element theory)]], have also been linked with astronomical observations of [[sunspot]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Sarah Allan. ''The Shape of the Turtle: Myth, Art and Cosmos in Early China''. 1991:31–32.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Five Elements or Forces (''wu xing'') – which, according to the Chinese, are metal, earth, fire, water, and wood – are first mentioned in Chinese literature in a chapter of the classic ''Book of History''. They play a very important part in Chinese thought: ‘elements’ meaning generally not so much the actual substances as the forces essential to human life.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Werner|first=E. T. C.|title=Myths and Legends of China|publisher=George G. Harrap &amp; Co. Ltd.|location=London Bombay Sydney|page=84|url=http://www.gutenberg.org/files/15250/15250-h/15250-h.htm|accessdate=2010-03-23|isbn=0-486-28092-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; Earth is a buffer, or an equilibrium achieved when the polarities cancel each other.{{citation needed|date=February 2009}} While the goal of Chinese medicine is to balance yin and yang in the body, the goal of feng shui has been described as aligning a city, site, building, or object with yin-yang force fields.&lt;ref&gt;Frank J. Swetz (2002). ''The Legacy of the Luoshu.'' pp. 31, 58.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Bagua (eight trigrams)===
Eight diagrams known as [[Ba gua|''bagua'']] (or ''pa kua'') loom large in feng shui, and both predate their mentions in the ''[[Yijing]]'' (or ''[[I Ching]]'').{{Citation needed|date=May 2011}} The ''Lo (River) Chart'' (''[[Luoshu]]'') was developed first,&lt;ref&gt;Frank J. Swetz (2002). ''Legacy of the Luoshu''. p. 36–37&lt;/ref&gt; and is sometimes associated with ''Later Heaven'' arrangement of the bagua. This and the ''[[Yellow River Map|Yellow River Chart]]'' (''Hetu'', sometimes associated with the ''Earlier Heaven bagua'') are linked to astronomical events of the sixth millennium BC, and with the Turtle Calendar from the time of Yao.&lt;ref&gt;Deborah Lynn Porter. ''From Deluge to Discourse.'' 1996:35–38.&lt;/ref&gt; The Turtle Calendar of Yao (found in the ''Yaodian'' section of the ''Shangshu'' or ''Book of Documents'') dates to 2300 BC, plus or minus 250 years.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;Sun and Kistemaker. ''The Chinese Sky During the Han.'' 1997:15–18.&lt;/ref&gt;

In ''Yaodian'', the cardinal directions are determined by the marker-stars of the mega-constellations known as the Four Celestial Animals:&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

*East: The [[Azure Dragon]] (Spring equinox)—''Niao'' (Bird 鳥), [[Antares|α Scorpionis]]
*South: The [[Vermilion Bird]] (Summer solstice)—''Huo'' (Fire 火), [[Alpha Hydrae|α Hydrae]]
*West: The [[White Tiger (Chinese astronomy)|White Tiger]] (Autumn equinox)—''Mǎo'' (Hair 毛), η Tauri (the [[Pleiades]])
*North: The [[Black Tortoise]] (Winter solstice)—''Xū'' (Emptiness, Void 虛), [[Alpha Aquarii|α Aquarii]], [[Beta Aquarii|β Aquarii]]

The diagrams are also linked with the ''sifang'' (four directions) method of divination used during the Shang dynasty.&lt;ref&gt;Aihe Wang. ''Cosmology and Political Structure in Early China.'' 2000: 107–28&lt;/ref&gt; The ''sifang'' is much older, however. It was used at Niuheliang, and figured large in [[Hongshan culture]]'s astronomy. And it is this area of China that is linked to [[Yellow Emperor]] (Huangdi) who allegedly invented the south-pointing spoon (see [[Compass#China|compass]]).&lt;ref&gt;Sarah M. Nelson, Rachel A. Matson, Rachel M. Roberts, Chris Rock, and Robert E. Stencel. ''[https://portfolio.du.edu/portfolio/getportfoliofile?uid=38863 Archaeoastronomical Evidence for Wuism at the Hongshan Site of Niuheliang] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060923142811/https://portfolio.du.edu/portfolio/getportfoliofile?uid=38863 |date=2006-09-23 }}.'' 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

==Traditional feng shui==
Traditional feng shui is an ancient system based upon the observation of heavenly time and earthly space. The literature of ancient China, as well as archaeological evidence, provide some idea of the origins and nature of the original feng shui techniques.

===Form School===
The Form School is the oldest school of feng shui. [[Qing Wuzi]] in the [[Han dynasty]] describes it in the "Book of the Tomb" [https://books.google.com/books?id=-mV09cvO8sYC&amp;lpg=PA75&amp;dq=Qing%20Wuzi&amp;pg=PA75#v=onepage&amp;q=Qing%20Wuzi&amp;f=false] and [[Guo Pu]] of the [[Jin Dynasty (265–420)|Jin dynasty]] follows up with a more complete description in ''[[The Book of Burial]]''.

The Form School was originally concerned with the location and orientation of tombs ([[Yin House feng shui]]), which was of great importance.&lt;ref name="Qimancy: Chinese Divination by Qi"/&gt; The school then progressed to the consideration of homes and other buildings ([[Yang House feng shui]]).

The "form" in Form School refers to the shape of the environment, such as mountains, rivers, plateaus, buildings, and general surroundings. It considers the five celestial animals (phoenix, green dragon, white tiger, black turtle, and the yellow snake), the [[yin-yang]] concept and the traditional five elements ([[Wu Xing]]: wood, fire, earth, metal, and water).

The Form School analyses the shape of the land and flow of the wind and water to find a place with ideal [[qi]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Complete Idiot's Guide to Feng Shui|authors=Moran, Yu, Biktashev|publisher=Pearson Education|year=2002}}&lt;/ref&gt; It also considers the time of important events such as the birth of the resident and the building of the structure.

===Compass School===
The Compass School is a collection of more recent feng shui techniques based on the eight [[cardinal directions]], each of which is said to have unique qi. It uses the [[Luopan]], a disc marked with formulas in concentric rings around a magnetic compass.&lt;ref name="fengshuinatural1"&gt;{{cite web|title=Feng Shui Schools|url=http://www.fengshuinatural.com/en/schools.html|publisher=Feng Shui Natural|accessdate=6 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Cheng Jian Jun and Adriana Fernandes-Gonçalves. ''Chinese Feng Shui Compass Step by Step Guide.'' 1998:46–47&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;MoonChin. ''Chinese Metaphysics: Essential Feng Shui Basics.'' {{ISBN|978-983-43773-1-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Compass School includes techniques such as [[Flying Star (feng shui technique)|Flying Star]] and [[Eight Mansions]].

===Transmission of traditional feng shui techniques===
Aside from the books written throughout history by feng shui masters and students, there is also a strong oral history. In many cases, masters have passed on their techniques only to selected students or relatives.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last = Cheung Ngam Fung | first =Jacky | title =History of Feng Shui| publisher = | year =2007 | url =http://www.fengshui-liufa.com/history.html| accessdate = |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070927122452/http://www.fengshui-liufa.com/history.html |archivedate = 2007-09-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Current usage of traditional schools===
There is no contemporary agreement that one of the traditional schools is most correct. Therefore, modern practitioners of feng shui generally draw from multiple schools in their own practices.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Feng Shui Schools |url=http://interiordesigncoursesdelhiinstitutes.in/2018/10/26/feng-shui-schools-delhi/|publisher=Feng Shui Natural |accessdate=6 February 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Western forms of feng shui==
More recent forms of feng shui simplify principles that come from the traditional schools, and focus mainly on the use of the [[bagua]].

===Aspirations Method===
The [[Eight Life Aspirations]] style of feng shui is a simple system which coordinates each of the eight cardinal directions with a specific life aspiration or station such as family, wealth, fame, etc., which come from the [[Ba gua#Bagua of the eight aspirations|Bagua government of the eight aspirations]]. Life Aspirations is not otherwise a geomantic system.

Traditional feng shui relies upon the compass to give accurate readings.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Guide to the Feng Shui Compass: A Compendium of Classical Feng Shui|first=Stephen|last=Skinner|publisher=[[Golden Hoard]]|year=2008|isbn=9780954763992|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=NqU2uQAACAAJ}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=8UCNAAAAQBAJ|p=185|title=Feng Shui for the Curious and Serious|volume=1|first=Phil N.|last=Nguyen|publisher=[[Xlibris Corporation]]|year=2008|isbn=9781469118826}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, critics point out that the compass degrees are often inaccurate as fluctuations caused by solar winds have the ability to greatly disturb the electromagnetic field of the earth.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|p=102|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=S4xDhVCxAQIC|title=The Cambridge Guide to the Solar System|first=Kenneth R.|last=Lang|edition=2|publisher=[[Cambridge University Press]]|year=2011|isbn=9781139494175}}&lt;/ref&gt; Determining a property or site location based upon Magnetic North will result in inaccuracies because true magnetic north fluctuates.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Earth's Inconstant Magnetic Field|url=https://science.nasa.gov/science-news/science-at-nasa/2003/29dec_magneticfield|publisher=NASA Science|accessdate=6 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Matteo Ricci]] (1552–1610), one of the founding fathers of [[Jesuit China missions]], may have been the first European to write about feng shui practices. His account in ''[[De Christiana expeditione apud Sinas]]...'' tells about feng shui masters (''geologi'', in Latin) studying prospective construction sites or grave sites "with reference to the head and the tail and the feet of the particular dragons which are supposed to dwell beneath that spot". As a Catholic missionary, Ricci strongly criticized the "recondite science" of geomancy along with [[astrology]] as yet another ''superstitio absurdissima'' of the heathens: "What could be more absurd than their imagining that the safety of a family, honors, and their entire existence must depend upon such trifles as a door being opened from one side or another, as rain falling into a courtyard from the right or from the left, a window opened here or there, or one roof being higher than another?".&lt;ref&gt;"China in the Sixteenth Century: The Journals of Matteo Ricci", Random House, New York, 1953. Book One, Chapter 9, pp. 84–85. This text appears in pp. 103–04 of Book One of the original Latin text by Ricci and [[Nicolas Trigault]], [https://books.google.com/books?id=iLsWAAAAQAAJ&amp;lr=&amp;pg=RA1-PA3#v=onepage&amp;q=&amp;f=false ''De Christiana expeditione apud Sinas suscepta ab Societate Jesu'']&lt;/ref&gt;

Victorian-era commentators on feng shui were generally ethnocentric, and as such skeptical and derogatory of what they knew of feng shui.&lt;ref&gt;Andrew L. March. 'An Appreciation of Chinese Geomancy' in ''The Journal of Asian Studies'', Vol. 27, No. 2. (February 1968), pp. 253–67.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1896, at a meeting of the Educational Association of China, Rev. P.W. Pitcher railed at the "rottenness of the whole scheme of Chinese architecture," and urged fellow missionaries "to erect unabashedly Western edifices of several stories and with towering spires in order to destroy nonsense about ''fung-shuy''".&lt;ref&gt;Jeffrey W.

After the founding of the [[People's Republic of China]] in 1949, feng shui was officially considered a "feudalistic superstitious practice" and a "social evil" according to the state's ideology and was discouraged and even banned outright at times.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://zjc.zjol.com.cn/05zjc/system/2005/01/14/003828695.shtml |title=Chang Liang (pseudoym), 14 January 2005, ''What Does Superstitious Belief of 'Feng Shui' Among School Students Reveal?'' |publisher=Zjc.zjol.com.cn |date=2005-01-31 |accessdate=2012-05-14 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120306142756/http://zjc.zjol.com.cn/05zjc/system/2005/01/14/003828695.shtml |archivedate=2012-03-06 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://blog.csdn.net/taoshilong/archive/2006/04/03/649650.aspx Tao Shilong, 3 April 2006, ''The Crooked Evil of 'Feng Shui' Is Corrupting The Minds of Chinese People'']{{Dead link|date=September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Feng shui remained popular in Hong Kong, and also in the [[Republic of China (Taiwan)]], where traditional culture was not suppressed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/asia/hongkong/8206601/Hong-Kong-government-spends-millions-on-feng-shui.html | location=London | work=The Daily Telegraph | first=Malcolm | last=Moore | title=Hong Kong government spends millions on feng shui | date=2010-12-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Persecution was the most severe during the [[Cultural Revolution]], when feng shui was classified as a custom under the so-called [[Four Olds]] to be wiped out. Feng shui practitioners were beaten and abused by [[Red Guards (China)|Red Guards]] and their works burned. After the death of [[Mao Zedong]] and the end of the [[Cultural Revolution]], the official attitude became more tolerant but restrictions on feng shui practice are still in place in today's [[China]]. It is illegal in the PRC today to register feng shui consultation as a business and similarly advertising feng shui practice is banned. There have been frequent crackdowns on feng shui practitioners on the grounds of "promoting feudalistic superstitions" such as one in Qingdao in early 2006 when the city's business and industrial administration office shut down an art gallery converted into a feng shui practice.&lt;ref&gt;[http://gwzz.blogbus.com/logs/2006/01/1854093.html Chen Xintang ''Art Gallery Shut by the Municipality's Business and Industrial Department After Converting to 'Feng Shui' Consultation Office'' Banduo Daoxi Bao, Qingdao, January 19, 2006] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060426162415/http://gwzz.blogbus.com/logs/2006/01/1854093.html |date=April 26, 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Some communist officials who had previously consulted feng shui were terminated and expelled from the Communist Party.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/hi/chinese/news/newsid_1210000/12108792.stm |title="風水迷信"困擾中國當局 – Feng Shui Superstitions Troubles Chinese Authorities|publisher=BBC News |date=9 March 2001|accessdate=2012-05-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Partly because of the [[Cultural Revolution]], in today's mainland China less than one-third of the population believe in feng shui, and the proportion of believers among young urban Chinese is said to be much lower&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.yuce49.com/showjs.asp?js_id=45 ''Debate on Feng Shui''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080215232943/http://www.yuce49.com/showjs.asp?js_id=45 |date=2008-02-15 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Learning feng shui is still somewhat considered taboo in today's China.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://jiugu861sohu.blog.sohu.com/58913151.html |title=Beware of Scams Among the Genuine Feng Shui Practitioners |publisher=Jiugu861sohu.blog.sohu.com |date= |accessdate=2012-05-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://culture.people.com.cn/GB/27296/3941393.html|title=ˮȨɽ--Ļ--|work=people.com.cn}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://newmind40.com/01_4/hxd2.htm|title=方术之国|work=newmind40.com|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304040204/http://newmind40.com/01_4/hxd2.htm|archivedate=2016-03-04|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless, it is reported that feng shui has gained adherents among Communist Party officials according to a BBC Chinese news commentary in 2006,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Jiang Xun |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/chinese/trad/hi/newsid_4870000/newsid_4872500/4872542.stm |title=Focus on China ''From Voodoo Dolls to Feng Shui Superstitions''|language=Chinese|publisher=BBC Chinese service|date=11 April 2006 |accessdate=2012-05-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; and since the beginning of Chinese economic reforms the number of feng shui practitioners is increasing. A number of Chinese academics permitted to research on the subject of feng shui are anthropologists or architects by profession, studying the history of feng shui or historical feng shui theories behind the design of heritage buildings, such as Cao Dafeng, the Vice-President of [[Fudan University]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fudan.edu.cn/new_genview/now_caidafeng.htm |title=蔡达峰 – Cao Dafeng |publisher=Fudan.edu.cn |date= |accessdate=2012-05-14 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120509032825/http://fudan.edu.cn/new_genview/now_caidafeng.htm |archivedate=2012-05-09 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; and Liu Shenghuan of [[Tongji University]].

===Contemporary feng shui===
Westerners were criticized at the start of the anti-Western [[Boxer Rebellion]] for violating the basic principles of feng shui in the construction of railroads and other conspicuous public structures throughout China. However, today, feng shui is practiced not only by the Chinese, but also by Westerners and still criticized by Christians around the world. Many modern Christians have an opinion of feng shui similar to that of their predecessors:&lt;ref&gt;Mah, Y.-B. Living in Harmony with One's Environment: A Christian Response to Feng Shui. ''Asia Journal of Theology.'' 2004, 18; Part 2, pp 340–361.&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;It is entirely inconsistent with Christianity to believe that harmony and balance result from the manipulation and channeling of nonphysical forces or energies, or that such can be done by means of the proper placement of physical objects. Such techniques, in fact, belong to the world of sorcery.&lt;ref&gt;Marcia Montenegro. Feng Shui" New Dimensions in Design. ''Christian Research Journal.'' 26:1 (2003)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Still others are simply skeptical of feng shui. Evidence for its effectiveness is based primarily upon anecdote and users are often offered conflicting advice from different practitioners. Feng shui practitioners use these differences as evidence of variations in practice or different schools of thought. Critical analysts have described it thus: "Feng shui has always been based upon mere guesswork".&lt;ref&gt;Edwin Joshua Dukes, The Encyclopædia of Religion and Ethics, T &amp; T Clark, Edinburgh, 1971, p 834&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Monty Vierra. Harried by "Hellions" in Taiwan. ''Sceptical Briefs'' newsletter, March 1997.&lt;/ref&gt; Some are skeptical of feng shui's lasting impact.&lt;ref&gt;Jane Mulcock. Creativity and Politics in the Cultural Supermarket: synthesizing indigenous identities for the r-evolution of spirit. ''Continuum''. 15:2. July 2001, 169–85.&lt;/ref&gt; Mark Johnson:&lt;ref&gt;"Reality Testing in Feng Shui." ''Qi'' Journal. Spring 1997&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;This present state of affairs is ludicrous and confusing. Do we really believe that mirrors and flutes are going to change people's tendencies in any lasting and meaningful way? ... There is a lot of investigation that needs to be done or we will all go down the tubes because of our inability to match our exaggerated claims with lasting changes.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Nonetheless, after [[Richard Nixon]] journeyed to the [[People's Republic of China]] in 1972, feng shui became marketable in the [[United States]] and has since been reinvented by New Age [[entrepreneur]]s for Western consumption. Critics of contemporary feng shui are concerned that with the passage of time much of the theory behind it has been lost in translation, not paid proper consideration, frowned upon, or even scorned. Robert T. Carroll sums up what feng shui has become in some instances:

&lt;blockquote&gt;...feng shui has become an aspect of interior decorating in the Western world and alleged masters of feng shui now hire themselves out for hefty sums to tell people such as [[Donald Trump]] which way his doors and other things should hang. Feng shui has also become another New Age "energy" scam with arrays of metaphysical products...offered for sale to help you improve your health, maximize your potential, and guarantee fulfillment of some fortune cookie philosophy.&lt;ref name="The Skeptic's Dictionary"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.skepdic.com/fengshui.html |title=feng shui|first= Robert T. |last=Carroll |work=The Skeptic's Dictionary |date= |accessdate=2012-05-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Others have noted how, when feng shui is not applied properly, it can even harm the environment, such as was the case of people planting "lucky bamboo" in ecosystems that could not handle them.&lt;ref name="Fabulous Feng Shui"&gt;Elizabeth Hilts, [http://www.emagazine.com/view/?1189&amp;src= "Fabulous Feng Shui: It's Certainly Popular, But is it Eco-Friendly?"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050227193557/http://www.emagazine.com/view/?1189&amp;src= |date=2005-02-27 }} ''E'' Magazine&lt;/ref&gt;

Feng shui practitioners in China find superstitious and corrupt officials easy prey, despite official disapproval. In one instance, in 2009, county officials in [[Gansu]], on the advice of feng shui practitioners, spent $732,000 to haul a 369-ton "spirit rock" to the county seat to ward off "bad luck."&lt;ref name=NYT51013&gt;{{cite news|title=China Officials Seek Career Shortcut With Feng Shui|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2013/05/11/world/asia/feng-shui-grows-in-china-as-officials-seek-success.html|accessdate=May 11, 2013|newspaper=The New York Times|date=May 10, 2013|author=Dan Levin}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The stage magician duo [[Penn and Teller]] dedicated an episode of their ''[[Penn &amp; Teller: Bullshit!|Bullshit!]]'' television show to criticise the construal of contemporary practice of Feng Shui in the Western World as [[science]]. In this episode, they devised a test in which the same dwelling was visited by five different Feng Shui consultants, all five producing different opinions about said dwelling, by which means it was attempted to show there is no consistency in the professional practice of Feng Shui.

==Contemporary practice ==

Many Asians, especially people of [[Chinese people|Chinese]] descent, believe it{{clarify|date=February 2014}}&lt;!-- I hope this "it" refers to feng shui, and not just states the importance of living such life. --&gt; is important to live a prosperous and healthy life as evident by the popularity of [[Fu Lu Shou]] in the Chinese communities. Many of the higher-level forms of feng shui are not easily practiced without having connections in the community or a certain amount of wealth because hiring an expert, altering architecture or design, and moving from place to place requires a significant financial outlay. This leads some people of the lower classes to lose faith in feng shui, saying that it is only a game for the wealthy.&lt;ref name="''Journal of Popular Culture''1"&gt;Emmons, C. F. "Hong Kong's Feng Shui: Popular Magic in a Modern Urban Setting." ''Journal of Popular Culture'', Volume 26, Issue 1, Summer 1992, p. 42&lt;/ref&gt; Others, however, practice less expensive forms of feng shui, including hanging special (but cheap) mirrors, forks, or woks in doorways to deflect negative energy.&lt;ref name="''Journal of Popular Culture''2"&gt;Emmons, C. F. "Hong Kong's Feng Shui: Popular Magic in a Modern Urban Setting." ''Journal of Popular Culture'', Volume 26, Issue 1, Summer 1992, p. 46&lt;/ref&gt;

In recent years,{{when|date=January 2013}} a new brand of easier-to-implement [[Do it yourself|DIY]] Feng Shui known as ''Symbolic Feng Shui'', which is popularized by best-selling author [[Lillian Too]], is being practised by Feng Shui [[enthusiast]]s. It entails placements of auspicious (and preferably aesthetically pleasing) [[Wu Xing|Five Element]] objects, such as ''Money God'' and ''tortoise'', at various locations of the house so as to achieve a pleasing and substitute-alternative ''Productive-Cycle'' environment if a good natural environment is not already present or is too expensive to build and implement.

Feng shui is so important to some strong believers, that they use it for healing purposes (although there is no empirical evidence that this practice is in any way effective) in addition to guide their businesses and create a peaceful atmosphere in their homes,&lt;ref name="Journal of Popular Culture''3"&gt;Emmons, C. F. "Hong Kong's Feng Shui: Popular Magic in a Modern Urban Setting." ''Journal of Popular Culture'', Volume 26, Issue 1, Summer 1992, p. 48&lt;/ref&gt; in particular in the bedroom where a number of techniques involving colours and arrangement are used to achieve enhanced comfort and more peaceful sleep.{{citation needed|date=June 2017}} In 2005, even Disney acknowledged feng shui as an important part of Chinese culture by shifting the main gate to [[Hong Kong Disneyland]] by twelve degrees in their building plans, among many other actions suggested by the master planner of architecture and design at Walt Disney Imagineering, [[Wing Chao]], in an effort to incorporate local culture into the theme park.&lt;ref name="Feng Shui Kingdom"&gt;Laura M. Holson, ''[https://www.nytimes.com/2005/04/25/business/worldbusiness/the-feng-shui-kingdom.html "The Feng Shui Kingdom"]''&lt;/ref&gt;

At [[Singapore polytechnic|Singapore Polytechnic]] and other institutions, many working professionals from various disciplines (including engineers, architects, property agents and [[interior design]]ers) take courses on feng shui and divination every year with a number of them becoming part-time or full-time feng shui (or [[geomancy]]) consultants eventually.&lt;ref name="AsiaOne"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.asiaone.com/News/Education/Story/A1Story20090206-119946.html |title=Feng Shui course gains popularity |publisher=Asiaone.com |date=2009-02-06 |accessdate=2012-05-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Abstract: "Extant written records indicate that knowledge of an ancient type of compass in China is very old – dating back to before the Han dynasty (206 BC – 220 AD) to at least the 4th century BC. Geomancy (feng shui) was practised for a long time (for millennia) and had a profound influence on the face of China's landscape and city plans. The tombs (pyramids) near the former Chinese capital cities of Xi'an and Luoyang (together with their suburban fields and roads) show strong spatial orientations, sometimes along a basic South-North axis (relative to the geographic pole), but usually with deviations of several degrees to the East or West. The use of the compass means that the needle was directed towards the actual magnetic pole at the time of construction, or last reconstruction, of the respective tomb. However the magnetic pole, relative to the nearly 'fixed' geographic pole, shifts significantly over time. By matching paleomagnetic observations with modeled paleomagnetic history we have identified the date of pyramid construction in central China with the orientation relative to the magnetic pole positions at the respective time of construction. As in Mesoamerica, where according to the Fuson hypothesis the Olmecs and Maya oriented their ceremonial buildings and pyramids using a compass even before the Chinese, here in central China the same technique may have been used. We found a good agreement of trends between the paleodeclinations observed from tomb alignments and the available global geomagnetic field model CALS7K.2."

== Artist ==
Claude Joseph Vernet was considered the leading French artist of his time in his genre, marine art and [[landscape painting]]. He came from a family of [[French painters]]: he was the son of a decorative painter, and his son Antoine-Charles-Horace Vernet, [[Carle Vernet]] (1758–1836), &lt;!-- painted large battle pictures for Napoleon, notably the Battle of Marengo (1806, Versailles), and after the restoration of the monarchy he became official painter to Louis XVIII, for whom he did racing and hunting scenes. --&gt; and his grandson [[Horace Vernet]] (1789–1863) were known as military painters. Vernet lived in Italy for 20 years, 1734 to 1753, where he had an atelier in [[Rome]]. His style was influenced by the Italian 17th-century painters [[Claude Lorrain]] and  [[Salvator Rosa]]. His landscapes and especially seascapes were celebrated for their romantic qualities. Upon his return to France, a series of marine paintings were commissioned from him around 1753 by the French king [[Louis XV]]. This was to depict a series of [[seaport]]s, of which 15 paintings were executed. The project lasted for about 10 years, and until 1765 he traveled around France painting seascapes, eventually abandoning the project unfinished.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.museothyssen.org/en/thyssen/ficha_artista/588|title=Biography and Works, Joseph Vernet|publisher=www.museothyssen.org|accessdate=2015-01-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://archive.org/stream/encyclopaediabri27chisrich#page/1029/mode/1up|title=Encyclopædia Britannica, Joseph Vernet|publisher=www.archive.org|accessdate=2015-01-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://arthistory.about.com/od/from_exhibitions/ig/making_nature/moela_agsa_09_08.htm|title=making_nature|publisher=arthistory.about.com|accessdate=2015-01-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Paintings ==
In the series of four paintings, the first depiction is entitled ''Morning''. The painting shows a misty morning scene with [[fishermen]] with their boat. The second, entitled ''Midday'' depicts a sudden, unexpected [[storm]]. The painting ''Evening'' shows women bathing and washing their clothes. The final scene shows a rocky [[inlet]], with fishermen drying their nets while others are gathered round a fire. The scenes depicted in the paintings were Vernet's favourite scenes that he painted in different settings throughout his career.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/arts/yourpaintings/artists/claude-joseph-vernet|title=Claude Joseph Vernet|publisher=www.bbc.co.uk|accessdate=2015-01-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nationaltrustcollections.org.uk/object/138286.1|title=National Trust Collections, Vernet|publisher=www.nationaltrustcollections.org.uk|accessdate=2015-01-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:ConnectorSymbols.svg|thumb|Schematic symbols for male and female connector pins]]
In [[electrical]] and [[machine|mechanical]] trades and manufacturing, each half of a pair of mating [[Electrical connector|connectors]] or [[fastener]]s is conventionally assigned the designation '''male''' or '''female'''. The "female" connector is generally a [[AC power plugs and sockets|receptacle]] that receives and holds the "male" connector. On occasion, the terms "male" and "female" are respectively referred to as the '''A''' and '''B''' ends{{citation needed|date=February 2017}}, though the names of some standards conflict with this as they contain the letters A or B within the name; unambiguous, though rare, terms include '''plug''' and '''socket''' or '''jack'''.

The assignment is a direct [[analogy]] with [[genitalia]] and [[heterosexual]] [[Sexual intercourse|sex]]; the part bearing one or more [[Protrusion|protrusions]], or which fits inside the other, being designated [[male]] in contrast to the part containing the corresponding indentations, or fitting outside the other, being designated [[female]]. Extension of the analogy results in the verb '''to [[mating|mate]]''' being used to describe the process of connecting two corresponding parts together. 

In some cases (notably electrical power connectors), the gender of connectors is selected according to rigid rules, to enforce a sense of one-way directionality (e.g. a flow of power ''from'' one device ''to'' another). This gender distinction is implemented to enhance safety or ensure proper functionality by preventing unsafe or non-functional configurations from being set up.

In terms of mathematical [[graph theory]], an electrical power distribution network made up of plugs and sockets is a [[directed tree]], with the directionality arrows corresponding to the female-to-male transfer of electrical power through each mated connection. This is an example where male and female connectors have been deliberately designed and assigned to physically enforce a safe network topology.

In other contexts, such as plumbing, one-way flow is ''not'' enforced through connector gender assignment. Flows through piping networks can be bidirectional, as in underground water distribution networks which have designed-in [[redundancy (engineering)|redundancy]]. In plumbing situations where one-way flow ''is'' desired, it is implemented through other means (e.g. gravity flow, one-way check valves), and not through male-female gender schemes.

==Mechanical fasteners==
[[Image:Bolt-with-nut.jpg|thumb|''Female'' nut threaded onto a ''male'' bolt]]
In mechanical design, the prototypical "male" component is a threaded bolt, but an alignment post, a [[mounting boss]], or a sheet metal tab connector can also be considered as male. Correspondingly, a threaded nut, an alignment hole, a mounting recess, or sheet metal slot connector is considered to be female.

While some mechanical designs are "one-off" custom setups not intended to be repeated, there is an entire [[fastener]] industry devoted to manufacturing mass-produced or semi-custom components. To avoid unnecessary confusion, conventional definitions of fastener gender have been defined and agreed upon.

==Modular construction toys==
[[Image:LEGO-01.jpg|thumb|Lego toy brick connections are ''male'' on top, and ''female'' underneath]]
Although this aspect is not highlighted in their promotional literature, several common construction toys&lt;ref name=Toys&gt;[[:Category:Construction toys]]&lt;/ref&gt; embody gendered (and in some cases, genderless) mechanical interconnections. This should not be surprising, since these toys feature the nearly infinite flexibility and versatility of shape that a modular interconnect architecture can enable. Mathematicians have begun to classify well-known [[construction set]]s using [[group theory]] to study the combinatoric possibilities of structures that can be built.

For example, the canonical [[LEGO]] plastic blocks have "female" indentations on the lower surface, and "male" bosses or protrusions on the upper surfaces. [[Meccano]] and [[Erector]] have many gendered connections, starting with the nut-and-bolt fasteners they use frequently.

[[Stickle bricks]], using interlocking plastic protrusions, are effectively genderless. [[Lincoln logs]] use a very simple form of genderless connections. [[Kapla]] or [[KEVA planks]] are extremely simple genderless systems interconnected only by gravity.

==Plumbing==
{{main article|Threaded pipe}}
[[Image:Malefemalepipe.jpg|thumb|right|Left: A ''male'' threaded pipe,&lt;br&gt;Right: a ''female'' threaded [[Piping and plumbing fittings|elbow]]]]

In plumbing fittings, the "M" or "F" usually comes at the beginning rather than the end of the abbreviated designation. For example:
* MIPT denotes Male Iron Pipe Thread;
* FIPT denotes Female Iron Pipe Thread.

A short length of pipe having an MIP thread at both ends is sometimes called a [[Piping and plumbing fittings#Nipple|nipple]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.plumbingsupply.com/chrome.html Chrome Fittings &amp; Nipples]&lt;/ref&gt; A short pipe fitting having an FIP thread at both ends is sometimes called a [[Piping and plumbing fittings#Coupling|coupling]].

[[Hermaphroditic]] connections, which include both male and female elements in a single unit, are used for some specialized tubing fittings, such as [[Storz]] [[fire hose]] connectors. A picture of such fittings appears in the 
[[#Genderless (hermaphroditic)]] connectors section of this article.

==Downspout==
[[Downspout]]s ('''downpipes''', '''rain conductors''' or '''leaders''') are used to convey rainwater from [[roof gutters]] to the ground through hollow pipes or tubes.  These tubes usually come in sections, joined by inserting the male end (often [[crimp connection|crimped]] with a special tool to slightly reduce its size) into the female end of the next section.  These connections are usually not sealed or caulked, instead relying on gravity to move the rainwater from the male end and into the receiving female connection located directly below.

==Ductwork==
[[Sheet metal]] [[ductwork]] for conveying air in [[HVAC]] systems typically uses gendered connections.  Typically,  the airflow through a ductwork connection is from male to female.  However, since one-way flow is implemented by forced-air fans or blowers,  "backwards" gendered connections can be seen frequently in some systems, since all connections are typically sealed with duct sealing [[Adhesive|mastic]] or tape to prevent leakage anyway.  The flow convention is usually loosely adhered to for simplicity of design, and to reduce the number of gender changer fittings required, but exceptions are made whenever expedient.

Although the gender of tubing and plumbing fittings is usually obvious, this may not be true of [[electrical connectors]] because of their more complex and varying constructions. Instead, connector gender is conventionalized and thus can be somewhat obscure to the uninitiated. For example, the female [[D-subminiature]] connector body projects outward from the mounting plane of the chassis, and this protrusion could be erroneously construed as male. Instead, the "maleness" of the D-subminiature connectors is defined by specific presence of ''male pins'', rather than by the protrusion of the connector, which is also true for many other pin-based connectors like [[XLR connector|XLR]]. The male/female distinction is more obvious with ring crimp lug connectors which are placed around a screw post, but again with spade or split ring crimp lug connectors the end alone is not obviously female.

Further confusion can be caused by the term "[[jack (connector)|jack]]", which is used for both female and male connectors and typically refers to the fixed (panel) side of a connector pair. IEEE STD 100, IEEE-315-1975 and [[IEEE 200-1975]] (replaced by [[ASME Y14.44-2008]]) define "[[plug (connector)|Plug]]" and "[[jack (connector)|Jack]]" by location or mobility, rather than gender.&lt;ref name=IEEE3151975&gt;{{cite book|title=Graphic Symbols for Electrical and Electronics Diagrams (including Reference Designation Letters)|year=1975|publisher=IEEE|url=http://standards.ieee.org/findstds/standard/315-1975.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=IEEE2001975&gt;{{cite book | title = Standard Reference Designations for Electrical and Electronics Parts and Equipments: IEEE-200-1975 (Reaffirmed 1988): Section 4.1.5.3 | publisher = IEEE and ANSI, New York, NY | year = 1975 | url = http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;q=ieee-200-1975}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=ASME-y14-44-2008&gt;{{cite book | title = Reference Designations for Electrical and Electronics Parts and Equipment: ASME Y14.44-2008 : Section 2.1.5.3 (2) | publisher = ASME, Fairfield, NJ | year = 2008 | url = https://www.asme.org/products/codes-standards/y1444-2008-reference-designations-electrical}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A connector in a fixed location is a jack and a moveable connector is a plug.&lt;ref name="IEEE3151975" /&gt;&lt;ref name="ASME-y14-44-2008" /&gt; The distinction is relative, so a portable radio is considered stationary compared to the cable from the headphones; the radio has a jack, and the headphone cable has a plug. Where the relationship is equal, such as when two flexible cables are connected, each is considered a plug.  Jacks use the [[reference designator]] prefix of J and plugs use the [[reference designator]] prefix of P.&lt;ref name="IEEE3151975" /&gt;&lt;ref name="ASME-y14-44-2008" /&gt;  It is possible in the case of box mounted connectors for the connector to be a receptacle with male pin contacts.  In this case the connector is designated a jack (J ref des) regardless of the contact gender because the housing for the contacts is in fact configured as the receptacle even though its mate (the plug) goes around the receptacle. See MIL-STD-38999 and similar cases.

It is common practice to use female connectors for jacks, so the informal gender-based usage often happens to agree with the functional description of the technical standards. However, this is ''not'' always the case; often-seen exceptions include a computer's AC Power Inlet and EIA232 DE9 Serial Port, or the male [[Coaxial power connector|coaxial power]] jacks for connecting external power adapters to portable equipment.

To summarize, it is considered best practice to use "male" and "female" for connector ''gender'', and "plug" and "jack" for connector ''function'' or ''mobility''.

===Variant usages===
In the UK, many [[Commonwealth countries]] and some non-English-speaking countries{{where|date=March 2012}}, the word "jack" may refer to the ''plug'' on the end of a removable cable. These connectors were originally referred to as "jack plugs", or plugs intended to be mated with fixed receptacles, or ''sockets'' (which North Americans would call "jacks"), but the second word was dropped.{{citation needed|date=March 2012}}  This variant usage is in direct contradiction to common usage and official standards in North America.

In the United Kingdom, for example, the connector on the end of a headphone lead is known as a "jack", that plugs into a ''socket'' on the main unit. The same generally occurs also in Italy, where the English word "jack" is commonly used to indicate the connector on the end of a headphone lead.

In Romania female connectors are known as "mamă" (mother) and male connectors are "tată" (father).

===Abbreviations and alternate terminology===
The standard letters "M" and "F" are commonly used in part numbers to designate connector gender. For example, in Switchcraft XLR [[microphone]] or [[hydrophone]] connectors, the part numbers are denoted as follows:
* A3F = Audio 3-pin Female connector;
* A3M = Audio 3-pin Male connector.

The terms '''plug''', '''pin''', and '''prong''' are also often used for "male" connectors, and '''receptacle''', '''socket''', and '''slot''' are used for "female" connectors. In many cases these terms are more common than ''male'' and ''female'', especially in documentation intended for the non-specialist. These nearly synonymous terms can cause a fair amount of confusion when the designations are shortened in labels.

For example, a female high-density [[D-subminiature]] connector with a size 1 shell can be named DE15F or DE15S (see accompanying pictures). Both terms mean the same thing but could be construed to be completely different items. Similarly, a male standard-density D-sub with a size 1 shell can be named DE9M or DE9P; a female standard-density D-sub with a size 2 shell can be named DA15F or DA15S; a male high-density D-sub with a size 3 shell can be named DB44M or DB44P; and so forth.

===Gender selection in electronic design===
Electronic designers often select female jack connectors for fixed mounting on electronic equipment they design. This is usually done because female connectors are more resistant to damage or contamination, by virtue of their concealed or recessed electrical contacts. A damaged motherboard connector can result in the scrapping of an expensive piece of electronic equipment. The risk of expensive damage is reduced by relegating the more exposed male contacts to connecting cables, which can be repaired or replaced at lower cost.

With an RS232 [[serial port]], the male connector is more fragile than the female connector.&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;

Such cost and reliability considerations probably drove the design decision to use female jack connectors on many computer terminals (and some personal computers) for the [[serial port]], in direct violation of the connector gender convention specified in the [[RS-232]] standard for "DTE" computer equipment. This confusing reversal of the RS-232 connector gender convention would cause many hours of frustration for ill-informed end users, as they tried to troubleshoot non-functional serial port equipment connections.

In the case of electrical power connections, designers do not reverse connector gender in such a casual fashion, because exposing live AC line power on male connectors is unsafe and generally illegal. Devices that need to be robust against mechanical damage use a special male [[IEC 60320 C14]] connector (see Gallery above), which is recessed below the surface of a mounting panel, providing the desired physical protection while conforming to safety regulations.

===Safety===
[[File:NEMA 5-15 Outlet 120V-15A.jpg|thumb|upright|Electrical power outlets are ''female'' for safety.]]

In electrical connections where [[voltage]] or [[Electric current|current]] is sufficient to cause [[Electric shock|injury]], the part permanently connected to the power ''source'' is invariably female, with concealed contacts, to prevent inadvertent touching of live conductors. A male plug, with fully exposed protruding contacts, is installed on the cord of (or directly onto) the device ''receiving'' the power.

In the case of consumer-level AC power, connector gender is used to implicitly enforce safe use of power connectors. Because of this consideration, it is illegal under [[electrical code]] to make or use any ''gender changers'' to connect AC line power to consumer-level equipment.

In [[Extra-low voltage|low-voltage]] use such as for [[telecommunication|data communications]], electrical shock hazard is not an issue, and male or female connectors are used based on other engineering factors such as convenience of use, cost, or ease of manufacturing. For example, the common [[Category 5 cable|"patch cables"]] used for [[Ethernet]] (and the similar cords used for [[telephone]]s) typically have male [[modular plug]]s on both ends, to connect to jacks on equipment or mounted in walls.

[[File:Hohlstecker und Hohlbuchse 5,5x2,5.jpg|thumb|left|Common 5.5×2.5&amp;nbsp;mm [[coaxial power connector]]s. Power is provided by the ''female'' ''plug'' on the right to the ''male'' ''jack'' on the left; the exposed conductors are not hazardous due to the low voltage. See text for further explanation. &lt;!--It's also usually isolated, but that's a lot of explanation...--&gt;]]

As an illustrative example of some design tradeoffs in power connector selection, consider the adjacent picture. A commonly seen [[coaxial power connector]] is usually set up so that power is fed ''from'' the female plug on the right ''into'' the male jack on the left (which is typically a part of the electronic device accepting the power). Although the plug is female, with a partially recessed center contact, it is still possible for casual accidental contact with a metallic object to [[Short circuit|short-circuit]] the power source. Depending on the design of the power adapter, it may react to a short circuit by shutting down temporarily, or instead by blowing out an internal safety [[Fuse (electrical)|fuse]].

In this example, the marginal reliability of the connector choice was deemed to be acceptable by the equipment designer, since the power adapter supplies [[Extra-low voltage|low voltage]] that does not pose an electric shock hazard. The potential fire hazard from accidental short-circuiting is addressed by the internal safety fuse, although this requires that a failed power adapter must be completely replaced. In a different design, if the power adapter were intended to supply a voltage sufficient to cause electrical shock, the semi-exposed center contact of the female plug would be considered unacceptably hazardous, requiring a different choice of power connector.
{{clear right}}

===Ambiguous gender===
Some electrical connectors are [[hermaphroditic]] because they include both male and female elements in a single unit intended to interconnect freely, without regard for gender. See the discussion of [[#Genderless (hermaphroditic)|Genderless connectors]] elsewhere in this article for more detailed information.

As an additional complication, certain electronic connector designs may incorporate combinations of male and female pins in a ''single'' connector body, for mating with a complementary connector with opposite gender pins in corresponding positions. In these unusual cases, gender is often defined by the shape of the connector ''body'', rather than the mixed-gender connector ''pins'' and ''sockets''. These types of connectors are not strictly speaking hermaphroditic, since mating connectors are ''not'' freely interchangeable. An informal term that has been used for these connectors is "bisexual", in addition to the more official terminology, '''mixed-gender'''. Thus, for example, one can have a mixed-gender female plug that connects to a mixed-gender male jack (though a reversed gender assignment of connectors would be a more typical design choice in this example).

Male connector pins are often protected by a '''shell''' (also called a '''shroud''', '''surround''', or '''shield'''), which may envelop the entire female connector when mated. [[RF connector]]s often have multiple layers of interlocking shells to properly connect the shields of [[Coaxial cable|coaxial]] and [[triaxial cable]]. In such cases, the gender is assigned based on the ''innermost'' connecting point.  With the exception of reverse polarity BNC or TNC, where the outer shell determines the gender and the innermost connecting points are opposite to a standard connector, for example a female RP-TNC connector has a solid innermost pin.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Better Know a Connector: RP-TNC|url=http://blog.showmecables.com/rp-tnc-connector/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another ambiguous situation arises with the connectors used for [[USB]], [[FireWire]] (IEEE-1394), [[HDMI]], and [[Thunderbolt (interface)|Thunderbolt]] serial data bus connections. Close examination of these connectors reveals that the contact "pins" are not actually pins, but instead are conductive surfaces that slide past each other when they mate. Therefore, the traditional pin and socket nomenclature is not applicable. Instead, most computer hardware people fall back to referring to the wrap-around metal shield on the plug connector ''as if'' it were a connector ''pin''. By this convention, the connectors on serial bus cables are "male plugs", and the corresponding connectors on equipment are "female jacks".  A unique connector configuration where the contacts are hermaphroditic is the ELCO Varicon where the contacts are bifurcated and nest with one another axial at a 90 degree rotation in cross-shaped wells.  In this case the plugs had the contacts oriented transversely and the sockets longitudinally. 

A casual glance at a USB "Type A" plug connector may give the false impression that it is hermaphroditic. However, a physical attempt to mate two USB "Type A" cables with each other reveals the fact that the connectors will not interconnect. Classifying according to mathematical [[graph theory]], USB buses are [[directed tree]]s, whereas FireWire buses have a true [[bus network]] topology. This difference is reflected in the bus connectors used, in that USB cables are asymmetrical (one end Type A, other end Type B) while FireWire cables may have identical connectors at both ends.

==Genderless (hermaphroditic)==
[[Image:Train coupling.jpg|thumb|Paired "knuckle" type hermaphroditic mechanical [[Janney coupler|couplers]] for railcars (viewed from above)]]
[[Image:Arduino Protoboard Shields.jpg|thumb|[[Arduino]] "shield" boards connected via stackable bus connectors]]
By definition, a [[hermaphroditic]] connector includes mating surfaces having simultaneous male and female aspects, involving complementary paired identical parts each containing both protrusions and indentations. These mating surfaces are mounted into identical fittings which can freely mate with any other, without regard for gender (provided that the size and type are already matched). Alternative names include '''hermaphrodite''', [[Androgynous Peripheral Attach System|androgynous]], '''genderless''', '''sexless''', '''combination''' (or '''combo'''), '''two-in-one''', '''two-way''', and other descriptive terms. Several of these latter alternate names are ambiguous in meaning, and should not be used unless carefully defined in context. True hermaphroditic connectors should not be confused with ''mixed gender'' connectors, which are described elsewhere in this article.

Another closely related type is the '''stackable connector''' for electronics, which typically has male pins on one surface, and complementary female sockets on the opposite surface, allowing multiple units to be stacked up like plastic [[milk crate]]s. Examples of this include stackable banana plugs, and interconnect cables specified for the [[IEEE-488]] instrumentation bus. '''Stackable mezzanine bus connectors''' are used on some modular microcomputer accessory boards for systems such as the [[Arduino]] add-on daughterboards called "shields". The older [[PC/104]] embedded PC modules use a similar stackable format for interconnection. Stackable connectors are not classified as hermaphroditic in the strictest sense, but are often described as such in looser usage.

The hermaphroditic design is useful when multiple complex or lengthy components must be arbitrarily connected in various combinations. For example, if hoses have hermaphroditic fittings, they can be connected without having to pull a lengthy hose and reverse it because it has the wrong gender to connect to another hose. Some military fiber optical cables also have hermaphroditic connectors to prevent "wrong gender" connector problems in field deployments.&lt;ref name=Timbercon&gt;{{cite web|last=Timbercon|title=Hermaphroditic Fiber Optic Connectors|url=http://www.timbercon.com/hermaphroditic-connectors/|accessdate=2011-03-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=AmphenolFiber&gt;{{cite web |last=Amphenol Fiber Systems International |title=TFOCA-III Fiber Optic Connectors |url=http://www.fibersystems.com/product_detail.aspx?pt=Products&amp;ProductID=60&amp;CategoryID=51 |accessdate=2011-03-24 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111118185522/http://www.fibersystems.com/product_detail.aspx?pt=Products&amp;ProductID=60&amp;CategoryID=51 |archivedate=2011-11-18 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; In a similar fashion, [[railcar]]s are usually equipped with hermaphroditic [[railway coupling]] mechanisms that allow either end of the vehicle to be connected to a [[train]] consist without having to turn the railcar around first.
For the same reason, several [[spacecraft docking mechanism]]s are designed to be "androgynous",
including the [[Androgynous Peripheral Attach System]], the [[NASA Docking System]], and [[Chinese Docking Mechanism]].

In the absence of genderless connectors, ''[[gender changer]]'' fittings might be used to enable certain connections. The designer of a connection system may use one or both schemes to allow arbitrary connectivity, or even combine both schemes into a single system.

When an enforced sense of unidirectionality or "one-way flow" is required for safety or other reasons (for example, AC electrical power connections), a strict assignment of connector genders is implemented to prevent undesired configurations, and gender changers are banned.

Some commonly seen examples of hermaphroditic connectors include the [[SAE connector]] for 12 V DC power, [[jackhammer]] air hose connectors, and the [[Anderson Powerpole]] series of modular high-current power connectors. The [[IBM]] [[token ring]] connector was another widespread example, but it has become obsolete and is being phased out. The General Radio Corporation ([[GenRad]]) developed a hermaphroditic coaxial radio frequency connector often called the "[[GR connector]]".

Some [[audio multicore cable]]s are fitted with hermaphroditic multipin quick-disconnect connectors for ease of use in the field. One style of this audio signal cable is fitted on both ends with connectors that are each populated half with pins and half with sockets.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.whirlwindusa.com/massdiff.html Whirlwind Technical Articles. ''Wiring MASS Connectors FAQ'']&lt;/ref&gt; The advantage to the user is that it does not matter which end connects to the [[Stage (theatre)|stage]] and which to the [[audio mixer]], facilitating faster set up.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.livesoundint.com/archives/2003/april/big/big.php Live Sound International. Archives, April 2003. ''Connect Corner: The ins and outs of multipin connector designs''. Peter Janis, Cabletek.]&lt;/ref&gt; Another style of connector uses hybrid male/female pins with a receiving slot fitted in the center of each two-tine pin, and relies on 90-degree rotation of the pin axes to mate. The connector housings themselves are sexed male and female.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.edac.net/product.html?ProductID=61 EDAC.

==Gender changers==
Devices used for mating two connectors of the same gender have a wide variety of terms, including for example: "[[gender changer]]", "gender mender", "gender bender", "gender blender", "sex changer", and "homosexual adapter".&lt;ref&gt;[http://catb.org/jargon/html/G/gender-mender.html Jargon File: gender mender]&lt;/ref&gt; A specific gender changer can be referred to by either the gender of its connectors, or the gender which it is designed to connect to, resulting in a thoroughly ambiguous terminology. Thus a "male gender changer" might have female connectors to mate two male ends, or male connectors to mate two female ends.

Adding to this potential for confusion, some gender changers also combine additional functions such as [[Crossover_cable|cross-over]] pin-outs or even [[Active_cable|embedding micro-controllers]] for performance, or for [[Logic_level#Logic_voltage_levels|logic level]] or protocol adaptations, which would properly make them an [[Adapter_(computing)|adapter]], but this nomenclature is sometimes neglected in marketing materials or common parlance.

'''''God's Choice: The Total World of a Fundamentalist Christian School''''' is a 1986 book written by [[Alan Peshkin]] and published by the [[University of Chicago Press]]. It is the product of his late 1970s 18-month [[ethnographic]] study of a 350-person [[Christian fundamentalist]] [[Baptist]] school in Illinois. He describes the [[K–12]] [[day school]]'s function as a [[total institution]] that educates about a singular truth ([[God's will]]) and subordination before God. The final chapter is a comparative analysis of the school and other schools, institutions, and social movements, wherein Peshkin concludes that the school is divisive in American society for promoting intolerance towards [[religious plurality]], the very condition that permits the school's existence.

Reviewers wrote that Peshkin's account was fair, and praised his decision to let the participants speak for themselves through quotations. They also noted that the book filled a literary [[Lacuna (manuscripts)|lacuna]] in scholarly understanding of the rapidly expanding and understudied fundamentalist [[Christian school]].

== Summary ==

''God's Choice: The Total World of a Fundamentalist Christian School'' is a 1986 book written by [[Alan Peshkin]].{{sfn|Appleby|1989|p=62}} It is a profile of an Illinois [[Christian fundamentalist]] school{{sfn|Appleby|1989|p=66}}—its policies, practices, and participants.{{sfn|Rose|1987|p=81}} Peshkin, then Professor of Education at the [[University of Illinois at Urbana–Champaign]],{{sfn|Holm|1986}} intended his account to be both impartial and "empathetic".{{sfn|Appleby|1989|p=68}} He presents the fundamentalists as disciplined, dedicated, and determined with "formulas for success" opposite "fragmented and defensive" detractors.{{sfn|Appleby|1989|p=68}} They believe in "one Truth"—God's plan—and reject philosophies of multiple truths.{{sfn|Appleby|1989|pp=68–69}} A teacher told Peshkin that their job is to prepare students for this "one pattern" of thought.{{sfn|Appleby|1989|p=69}} In turn, the community's constituents do not wish to leave, but appreciate conformity as an end in itself. Peshkin describes the school as a "[[total institution]]": a place where many similar people live by their own formal rules apart from outside society, as based on [[Erving Goffman]]'s 1961 essay. Peshkin asserts that this was a natural conclusion from a school "based on absolute truth".{{sfn|Appleby|1989|p=72}} ''God's Choice'' was the third book in his series of studies on school–community relationships.{{sfn|Holm|1986}} It was published by the [[University of Chicago Press]].{{sfn|Appleby|1989|p=62}}

In 1978, Peshkin moved to an Illinois community of 50,000 people that he pseudonymically called Hartney, where he stayed and observed for 18 months.{{refn|Peshkin did return home on weekends, leaving Friday night and returning for Sunday services.{{sfn|Holm|1986}}}} He lived in an apartment within the home of a family associated with what he called the Bethany [[Baptist]] church. Peshkin studied their 350-student [[K–12]] Christian day school, Bethany Baptist Academy (also a pseudonym). The school opened six years prior with 88 students{{sfn|Appleby|1989|p=67}} and was one of over one thousand members of the [[American Association of Christian Schools]].{{sfn|Holm|1986}} The study focuses on the 125 students in the junior–senior high school.{{sfn|Holm|1986}} After a semester, Peshkin began to interview the community members, and used their quotes to let them "speak for themselves".{{sfn|Holm|1986}} The book includes eight portraits of students—four from faith and four "scorners" who "consciously deviate"—as well as student and teacher survey data, displayed in 16 tables.{{sfn|Holm|1986}} An appendix includes course offerings and a bibliography.{{sfn|Holm|1986}}

Peshkin's findings show a "total world" where the lessons of religion and education are intertwined into an "interrelated, interdependent" philosophy.{{sfn|Appleby|1989|p=70}} The academy's intent is to make Christian professionals as what Peshkin describes as "a vocational school directed to work in the Lord's service".{{sfn|Appleby|1989|p=71}} When compared to the work of public schools, the private school's instructors said both kinds of institutions impose a lifestyle and set of values as a kind of "brainwashing".{{sfn|Appleby|1989|p=71}} Peshkin notes that while students "largely identify with" and uphold the fundamentalist teachings, they permit themselves the option of having "individual interpretations" and minor beliefs.{{sfn|Rose|1987|p=82}} Some students either dissent against the academy's rules or are regarded as too pious, but most students are moderate.{{sfn|Groves|1989|p=227}}

Students take classes to be effective Christian leaders, including "Bible study and 'soul-winning', English, speech, drama, and music", which are seen as important to "read and proclaim the Word".{{sfn|Appleby|1989|p=71}} Academy teachers establish their authority through discipline and teach "the truth" as established by "facts" from the Bible.{{sfn|Appleby|1989|p=71}} Bible passages are associated with the subject matter in a process called "integration".{{sfn|Appleby|1989|p=71}} The academy uses science books from [[Bob Jones University]] as an alternative to books that promote secular humanism, which is described as "the 'official religion' of the public school system".{{sfn|Appleby|1989|p=71}} The Bob Jones science books associate the Bible with science, and often comment the relationship between God's intelligence and the intricacies of nature. Classes like science, social studies, and math are viewed as less important for the goal of making Christian professionals apart from their training to do "everything a sinner can do, better".{{sfn|Appleby|1989|p=71}} Some classes are "memorization and recitation"-focused, reflecting an inelastic view of knowledge, which the academy believes to be fixed as based in biblical inerrancy.{{sfn|Appleby|1989|p=71}} Their biggest external influence on curriculum is new books, which may affect how classes are taught, though the content ("the truth") remains the same.{{sfn|Appleby|1989|p=71}}

In a chapter on teacher selection and training, the task of socializing students with obedience and discipline takes precedence over the task of teaching content.{{sfn|Appleby|1989|pp=71–72}} Students are under constant supervision to uphold a pledge to avoid outside activities such as theater, fashion, dances, and certain television shows. They also avoid some activities altogether, such as sexualized contact, drugs, alcohol, and smoking. This pledge is to be upheld at home as well, and students are encouraged to report errancies. Teachers too pledge to prioritize "the pursuit of holiness" over all things in a "born again" activity where they "confess their sins and accept Jesus Christ as their personal savior".{{sfn|Appleby|1989|p=72}} The school is unapologetic in its insistence on "telling the kids what is right" and its according preference for lecture over discussion.{{sfn|Holm|1986}} Teachers are also afforded the option of [[corporal punishment]], though it is rarely used.{{sfn|Appleby|1989|p=72}}

The last two chapters feature Peshkin's commentary on the school in society, its tradeoffs and comparison with other total institutions{{sfn|Holm|1986}} and larger social movements, like the [[Christian right|New Religious Right]].{{sfn|Groves|1989|p=228}} He also compares the academy to public and parochial schools, wherein he finds public school students more politically tolerant and acceptant of [[religious pluralism]]. Peshkin's final reflections are written as a "[[cost-benefit analysis]]" of these Christian schools in the larger American society.{{sfn|Rose|1987|p=81}} In the last chapter, Peshkin contemplates how his Jewish identity is insulated within a pluralistic and secular society, and how he is fearful of absolutist "imperious, implacable logic" and "zeal for conversion and exclusivism".{{sfn|Appleby|1989|pp=69–70}} He recounted that while the school spoke derogatorily of non-fundamentalists and non-Christians, no one spoke of the American religious plurality that permitted this.{{sfn|Appleby|1989|p=70}} In response to the encroaching state, fundamentalists feel that their political conviction should mirror that of their religion.{{sfn|Appleby|1989|p=73}} Peshkin views the school as schismatic in a larger society for promoting intolerance towards fellow Americans.{{sfn|Groves|1989|p=227}} He also praised traits of the schools including its community, dedicated teachers, and attractive image. At the time of print, Christian schools like Bethany were outpacing the growth of other schools.{{sfn|Holm|1986}} In 1989, Christian schools comprised about 20% of private school enrollment—around 700,000 students.{{sfn|Appleby|1989|p=66}}

== Reception ==

Reviewers wrote that Peshkin's account was fair in its presentation,{{sfn|Rose|1987|p=81}}{{sfn|Parsons|1986|p=41}} and that his choice to let individuals "speak for themselves" through abundant quotations was a strength.{{sfn|Holm|1986}}{{sfn|Rose|1987|p=81}} They also noted how the book filled a gap in the field{{sfn|Rose|1987|p=82}}{{sfn|Pierard|1987|p=167}} and that his final chapter was too moralistic.{{sfn|Groves|1989|p=228}}

R. Scott Appleby (''[[American Journal of Education]]'') wrote that Peshkin succeeded at his attempt to be impartial, and that his presentation of fundamentalist culture is made both "understandable" and, in part, "admirable".{{sfn|Appleby|1989|p=68}} He reflected that this Christian pedagogy was closer to indoctrination than education in that it did not develop "critical skills and ... human capacities" in "open-ended" learning but professed a fixed chain of knowledge "from on high" where humans are errant and need authoritarian guidance.{{sfn|Appleby|1989|p=70}} Appleby added that fundamentalism blames public schools and its associated state apparatus as both a manufacturer enemy needed to feed its "sense of crisis" and for creating "unsafe" areas unregulated by "Christian truth".{{sfn|Appleby|1989|p=73}} Sociologist Susan Rose "broadens the base" of ''God's Choice'' in her 1988 ''Keeping Them Out of the Hands of Satan'', and Appleby writes that the two books compliment each other's lacunae. While ''God's Choice'' has an "engaging, sometimes riveting narrative" with vivid characters but little outside information apart from statistics, ''Keeping Them Out of the Hands of Satan'' includes extra detail on how fundamentalist groups interact and share a larger societal milieu.{{sfn|Appleby|1989|p=74}} For example, Rose explains the difference in "born-again experiences" of evangelicals and fundamentalists, which Peshkin glosses over.{{sfn|Appleby|1989|p=75}}

In her own review of Peshkin's book, Rose (''[[Contemporary Sociology]]'') praised its "clear and detailed"{{sfn|Rose|1987|p=81}} contribution to the field but wished for more overview material on the Christian School Movement's rise, proponents, philosophical consistency, and "sociohistorical context".{{sfn|Rose|1987|p=82}} She wrote that few had studied Christian schools, the "fastest growing sector of private education in the United States".{{sfn|Rose|1987|p=81}} In commending Peshkin's even-handedness, she wrote that his forthrightness about declaring his own biases and effort to present participant voices through direct quotation were strong elements, though he described more than he analyzed. Rose felt that the "interesting" final chapters of analysis and comparison with public schools "grounded" the overall ethnography, though she wished for more comparison of the adolescent student experience between the academy and other kinds of American schools.{{sfn|Rose|1987|p=81}} She considers Peshkin's "discussion of the politics of pluralism", that Christian schools both add to American religious pluralism while advocating against it, possibly his best contribution.{{sfn|Rose|1987|p=82}}

Jean Holm (''[[The Times Higher Education Supplement]]'') too noted the fast growth of conservative Christian schools but added that the book was also relevant in Britain, which was experiencing similar growth. She found the first few chapters somewhat repetitive as it expressed the uniformity of the school's practices.{{sfn|Holm|1986}} Richard V. Pierard (''[[Christian Century]]'') &lt;!--wrote that television evangelism and the New Christian Right had popularized conservative fundamentalism beginning in the 1950s. Their schools were later accepted by [[Secretary of Education]] [[William Bennett]] and [[United States President|President]] [[Ronald Reagan]] in the 1980s. Pierard --&gt;felt that Peshkin wrote with "deeply respect" for the school and its community, but Pierard, himself an evangelical, was "disturbed" by the community's "indoctrinated" values—"biblical absolutes" that are "part of a conservative program that has been read into Scripture".{{sfn|Pierard|1987|pp=167–168}} Paul F. Parsons (''[[Christianity Today]]'') noted that Peshkin found the school successful by traditional terms, with standardized tests, orderly climate, and "fun-loving" students, but lacking free exchange of ideas, as education is seen more as a transfer than a quest, and students do not learn "choice, doubt, suspended judgment, [or] dissent".{{sfn|Parsons|1986|p=35}} Parsons affirmed Peshkin's findings as "remarkably representative" based on his own visits to "Christian schools in 60 cities", though others are less absolutist.{{sfn|Parsons|1986|p=41}} And while Julian McAllister Groves (''[[Journal of Contemporary Ethnography]]'') described the text as "beautifully written" and "poetic", he doubted whether the school's students were as converted as they said, and felt that Peshkin might have seen more "role distance" and examples of playing along simply for community acceptance had he stayed for lunch and other informal observations.{{sfn|Parsons|1986|pp=227–228}}

"'''Infinite Crisis'''" is a 2005–2006 comic book storyline published by [[DC Comics]], consisting of an eponymous, seven-issue [[comic book]] [[Limited series (comics)|limited series]] written by [[Geoff Johns]] and illustrated by [[Phil Jimenez]], [[George Pérez]], [[Ivan Reis]], and [[Jerry Ordway]], and a number of tie-in books. The main miniseries debuted in October [[2005 in comics|2005]], and each issue was released with two variant covers: one by Pérez, and one by [[Jim Lee]] and Sandra Hope.

The series storyline was a [[sequel]] to DC's [[1985 in comics|1985]] limited series ''[[Crisis on Infinite Earths]]'', which "rebooted" much of the DC continuity in an effort to fix 50 years of contradictory character history. It revisited characters and concepts from that earlier ''Crisis'', including the existence of DC's [[Multiverse (DC Comics)|Multiverse]]. Some of the characters featured were [[parallel universe (fiction)|alternate versions]] of comic icons such as an alternate [[Superman]] named [[Superman (Kal-L)|Kal-L]], who came from a parallel universe called Earth-Two. A major theme was the nature of heroism, contrasting the often dark and conflicted modern-day heroes with memories of "lighter" and ostensibly more noble and collegial heroes of [[American comic book]]s' [[Silver Age of Comics|earlier days]].

''Infinite Crisis'' #1 was ranked first in the top 300 comics for October 2005 with pre-order sales of 249,265. This was almost double the second ranked comic ''[[House of M]]'' #7 which had pre-order sales of 134,429.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| date=2005-11-15| url=http://www.icv2.com/articles/home/7812.html| title=Top 300 Comics Actual—October 2005| publisher=icv2.com
|accessdate=2008-07-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Infinite Crisis'' #2 was also the top seller in top 300 comics for November 2005 with pre-order sales of 207,564.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| date=2005-12-19

==Overview==
The plot begins when, in ''Crisis on Infinite Earths'', [[Superman (Earth Two)|Kal-L]] (the Superman of pre-''Crisis'' Earth-Two), the [[Superboy-Prime|Superboy of Earth Prime]], [[Alexander Luthor, Jr.]] of pre-Crisis Earth-Three, and [[Lois Lane#Golden Age|Lois Lane Kent]] of pre-''Crisis'' Earth-Two voluntarily sequestered themselves in "paradise". DC officially began leading up to the new ''Crisis'' with a [[one-shot (comics)|one-shot]] issue ''[[Countdown to Infinite Crisis]]'', followed by four six-issue limited series that tied into and culminated in ''Infinite Crisis''.

Once the ''Crisis'' was completed, DC used the ''[[One Year Later]]'' event to move the narratives of most of its DC Universe series forward by one year. The weekly series ''[[52 (comics)|52]]'' began publication in May [[2006 in comics|2006]], and depicts some of the events which occurred between ''Infinite Crisis'' and ''One Year Later''.

In [[2008 in comics|June 2008]], a third and ''[[Final Crisis]]'' began a run, set immediately following the conclusion of the 51-issue ''[[Countdown to Final Crisis]]''.

==Publication history==

===Lead-ups===
''Infinite Crisis'' was announced in March [[2005 in comics|2005]]. The event was kicked off with the release of ''[[Countdown to Infinite Crisis]]''. ''Countdown to Infinite Crisis'' was followed by four six-issue [[Limited series (comics)|limited series]]: ''[[The OMAC Project]]'', ''[[Rann–Thanagar War]]'', ''[[Day of Vengeance]]'', and ''[[Villains United]]'', as well as a four-part [[Limited series (comics)|limited series]] ''DC Special: The Return of Donna Troy''. These first four limited series each had a special tie-in issue, released at monthly intervals during the ''Infinite Crisis'' event.

===Tie-ins===
As with many large-scale comic crossovers, ''Infinite Crisis'' featured a large number of tie-ins. Before the event was announced, books such as ''[[Adam Strange]]'' and ''[[Identity Crisis (DC Comics)|Identity Crisis]]'' were being described as part of bigger plans. After ''Countdown'', several books were identified as tie-ins to the four mini-series. Thus, although ''Infinite Crisis'' itself is only seven issues long, its plot elements appeared in dozens of publications.

Some of these books were of direct and major importance, such as the ''Superman'' "''Sacrifice''" and ''JLA'' "''Crisis of Conscience''" storylines, the latter of which ended with the Justice League's lunar [[Justice League Watchtower|Watchtower]] being destroyed, leading directly into ''Infinite Crisis'' #1.

===Editorial planning===
DC Comics executive editor [[Dan DiDio]] stated that ''Infinite Crisis'' was being hinted at in various stories for two years prior to its launch, starting with the "death" of [[Donna Troy]].&lt;ref&gt;{{note|newsarama.1}} {{cite web | title=Counting Down in the DCU with Dan Didio | url=http://www.newsarama.com/pages/DC/Didio_Countdown.htm | accessdate=February 10, 2006 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20060410185820/http://www.newsarama.com/pages/DC/Didio_Countdown.htm &lt;!-- Bot retrieved archive --&gt; |archivedate = April 10, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; The leadup was mostly understated until the release of the ''[[Adam Strange]]'' limited series in 2004, at which point industry press began to report that DC was planning a very large event, mentioning the titles ''[[Teen Titans]]'', ''[[Wally West|The Flash]]'', and ''[[Justice Society of America|JSA]]'', all written by Geoff Johns. {{Citation needed|date=February 2007}}

With ''Countdown to Infinite Crisis'', ''Infinite Crisis'' began to visibly affect DC's editorial policy. Geoff Johns and [[Grant Morrison]] moved into editorial positions in addition to their writing duties, respectively to coordinate coherence of the DC Universe and to handle reimaginings of several characters.{{Citation needed|date=August 2008}} [[Mark Waid]] signed an exclusive contract with DC, receiving a similar editorial role. DC replaced its official decades-old logo (the "DC bullet") with a new one (the "DC spin") that debuted in the first issue of ''DC Special: The Return of Donna Troy''.

Aside from marking a major editorial shift within DC Comics, ''Infinite Crisis'' was a return to large company-wide crossovers of a sort that had been uncommon since the downturn of the comic industry in the 1990s.

==Plot==
The story begins in the wake of the four lead-in [[Limited series (comics)|limited series]], with [[Superman]], [[Wonder Woman]], and [[Batman]] feuding, the [[Justice League Watchtower|JLA Watchtower]] destroyed, and the heroes of the world all facing a variety of menaces. Over this backdrop, [[Superman (Earth-Two)|Kal-L]] (the [[Earth-Two]] Superman), along with [[Lois Lane#Golden Age|Earth-Two's Lois Lane]], [[Earth-Three]]'s [[Alexander Luthor, Jr.|Alexander Luthor]], and [[Superboy-Prime]] escape from the [[pocket universe]] where they had been left in at the end of ''[[Crisis on Infinite Earths]]''.&lt;ref name="IC1"&gt;{{Cite comic|Writer = Johns, Geoff|Title = Infinite Crisis|Volume = 1|Issue = 1|Date = December 2005|Publisher = DC Comics}}&lt;/ref&gt; Kal-L seeks out his cousin, [[Power Girl]], also a survivor of Earth-Two.  Believing Lois' health will improve on her native world, he hopes to replace the current Earth with Earth-Two, which he considers perfect.&lt;ref name="IC2"&gt;{{Cite comic|Writer = Johns, Geoff|Title = Infinite Crisis|Volume = 1|Issue = 2|Date = January 2006|Publisher = DC Comics}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="jsa82"&gt;''JSA'' #82 (2006)&lt;/ref&gt;

Kal-L tries to enlist Batman's support, stating that the Post-Crisis Earth's inherent "bad" nature caused Batman's recent mistrust and hostility. Batman refuses and tries to use his Kryptonite Ring, but as this is not native to Kal-L's universe, it fails, and is destroyed by heat-vision. Afterward, Batman learns Superboy-Prime destroyed the JLA Watchtower.&lt;ref name="IC3"&gt;{{Cite comic|Writer = Johns, Geoff|Title = Infinite Crisis|Volume = 1|Issue = 3|Date = February 2006|Publisher = DC Comics}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Alexander reveals to Power Girl that he and Superboy-Prime had been leaving their "paradise" for some time, manipulating events to help create an inter-dimensional tuning fork. Using the [[Anti-Monitor]]'s remains and captured heroes and villains specifically attuned to former universes (Power Girl among them after Superboy-Prime knocks her out), Alex restores Earth-Two, unpopulated except for the Earth-Two heroes transported there.&lt;ref name="IC4"&gt;{{Cite comic|Writer = Johns, Geoff|Title = Infinite Crisis|Volume = 1|Issue = 4|Date = March 2006|Publisher = DC Comics}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Superboy-Prime attacks [[Superboy (Kon-El)|Conner Kent]], this world's Superboy. Multiple super-teams intervene. Superboy-Prime accidentally kills several heroes before the [[Flash (comics)|Flash]]es and [[Bart Allen|Kid Flash]] force him into the [[Speed Force]], assisted by the speedsters already within it. [[Flash (Jay Garrick)|Jay Garrick]], the only speedster left behind, says the Speed Force is now gone.&lt;ref name="IC4" /&gt;&lt;ref name="tt31"&gt;''Teen Titans'' (vol. 3) #32 (2006)&lt;/ref&gt;

Seeking to create a perfect world, Alexander restores many alternate Earths. The Earth-Two Lois dies, and an aggrieved Kal-L and the younger Superman Kal-El fight until Wonder Woman separates them.&lt;ref name="IC5"&gt;{{Cite comic|Writer = Johns, Geoff|Title = Infinite Crisis|Volume = 1|Issue = 5|Date = April 2006|Publisher = DC Comics}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="s226"&gt;''Superman'' (vol. 2) #226–227 (2006)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="aos648"&gt;''Adventures of Superman''  #648 &amp; #649 (2006)&lt;/ref&gt; Bart Allen (wearing [[Flash (Barry Allen)|Barry Allen]]'s costume and aged to adulthood) emerges from the Speed Force, warning that he and the other speedsters were unable to hold Superboy-Prime, who returns wearing Anti-Monitor inspired armor that stores yellow sun radiation to empower him, making him even stronger.

Batman's strike force destroys Brother Eye, a satellite AI created by Batman that had gone rogue and begun transforming civilians into nano-infused robots. Alexander selects and merges alternate Earths, trying to create a "perfect" world, until [[Firestorm (comics)|Firestorm]] blocks his efforts. Conner, [[Dick Grayson|Nightwing]], and [[Wonder Girl (Cassie Sandsmark)|Wonder Girl]] release the Tower's prisoners.&lt;ref name="tt32"&gt;''Teen Titans'' (vol. 3) #33 (2006)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="IC6"&gt;{{Cite comic|Writer = Johns, Geoff|Title = Infinite Crisis|Volume = 1|Issue = 6|Date = May 2006|Publisher = DC Comics}}&lt;/ref&gt; Fighting each other, Conner and Superboy-Prime collide with the tower, destroying it. The multiple Earths recombine into a "New Earth" as Conner dies in Wonder Girl's arms. Power Girl soon arrives and asks Kal-El what happened to Lois. The answer causes her to break down prompting her to ask Kal-L why.

He answers her simply, telling her it was because he chose the wrong Superboy to condemn and the wrong Superboy to condone.

When a horde of supervillains attack Metropolis,&lt;ref name="ic villains"&gt;''Infinite Crisis Special: Villains United'' (2006)&lt;/ref&gt; heroes, current and retired, fly off to the rescue. They are joined by the National Guard. The battle results in multiple deaths on both sides, including many by Superboy-Prime himself, who kills villains and heroes alike. During the battle, Superboy-Prime takes off to destroy [[Oa]], planning to collapse the Universe, and recreate it with himself as the only superhero. Superboy-Prime breaks through a 300-mile thick wall of willpower created by the [[Green Lantern Corps]] and then kills thirty-two Green Lanterns before Kal-L and Kal-El carry him toward what is left of [[Krypton (comics)|Krypton]]. It is essentially a huge cloud of [[kryptonite]]. Flying through Krypton's red sun, [[Rao (comics)|Rao]], destroys Superboy-Prime's armor and causes all three Kryptonians' powers to diminish. Falling to the sentient planet (and Green Lantern Corps member) [[Mogo]], they fight. Kal-El finally knocks Superboy-Prime out and the older Superman Kal-L dies of his injuries in the arms of his cousin, Power Girl.

Back on Earth, Batman, struggling with Superboy's death and Nightwing's severe injuries sustained during the Metropolis battle, contemplates shooting Alex. Batman is discouraged by Wonder Woman. Alex manages to escape.&lt;ref name="dc-ency"&gt;{{Cite book  | last = Wallace  | first = Dan | author-link =  | contribution = Batman | editor-last = Dougall  | editor-first = Alastair  | title = The DC Comics Encyclopedia  | pages = 40–44  | publisher = [[Dorling Kindersley]]  | place = London  | year = 2008 | isbn = 0-7566-4119-5  | postscript = .}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Wonder Woman]], Batman, and [[Superman]] later meet up in [[Gotham City]]. Wonder Woman plans to find out who she is. Batman plans a similar journey of self-discovery, revisiting the training of his youth, this time with [[Dick Grayson]], now healthier, and with [[Robin (Tim Drake)|Tim Drake]] joining him. Superman retires from super heroics until his powers return.&lt;ref name="upupaway"&gt;[[One Year Later|"''Up, Up, and Away''"]]&lt;/ref&gt;

Hiding in an alley in [[Gotham City]] and making new plans, Alexander Luthor is found by [[Lex Luthor]] and the [[Joker (comics)|Joker]]. The Joker deforms him by spraying acid onto his face, then electrifies it, and finally, kills Alexander by shooting him as Lex mocks him for making the mistake of not letting the Joker play in the [[Secret Society of Super Villains|Secret Society]].

The Green Lantern Corps imprison Superboy-Prime inside a red [[Sun-Eater]]. The series ends with him carving an ''[[Superman logo|S]]'' into his chest with his bare hands and declaring that he has escaped from worse prisons than this.&lt;ref name="IC7"&gt;{{Cite comic|Writer = Johns, Geoff|Title = Infinite Crisis|Volume = 1|Issue = 7|Date = June 2006|Publisher = DC Comics}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Hardcover revisions ===
The [[hardcover]] collecting all seven issues of ''Infinite Crisis'' included changes in coloring, as well as, more significantly, alterations in [[dialogue]], most of which relate to hints to the re-emergence of the [[DC Multiverse]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://jigsawmen.googlepages.com/thecollectededition|title=The Collected Edition|publisher=The Annotated ''Infinite Crisis''|accessdate=2008-02-19 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20080703223840/http://jigsawmen.googlepages.com/thecollectededition &lt;!-- Bot retrieved archive --&gt; |archivedate = 2008-07-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://blog.newsarama.com/2007/01/24/marvel-at-math/?p=1330|title=nfinite Rewrites, or: Crisis on Infinite Versions of DC's Major Crossover Series|publisher=[[Newsarama]]|date=2006-10-11|accessdate=2008-02-19}} {{Dead link|date=October 2010|bot=H3llBot}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Also changed is the two-page spread near the end of the book, where a new [[George Pérez]] image is substituted. Four additional pages of art by [[Phil Jimenez]] were added, who also illustrated new cover art for the dust jacket of hardcover collection. An interview section included as an afterword explains the reasoning behind some of these alterations.

==Consequences==
{{main|Character changes during Infinite Crisis|Continuity changes during Infinite Crisis}}

===Aftermath===
*''[[52 (comics)|52]]'': Weekly comic book presenting events that occur during the year between ''Infinite Crisis'' #7 and the "''One Year Later''" stories.
*''[[Blüdhaven|Crisis Aftermath: The Battle for Blüdhaven]] #1–6
*''[[Spectre (comics)|Crisis Aftermath: The Spectre]] #1–3
*''[[Crisis Aftermath: In the Wake of Infinite Crisis: Brave New World]]''
*''[[One Year Later]]'': After the publication of ''Infinite Crisis'' #5, storylines in most DC Universe series jumped forward one year, occurring after the events chronicled in ''52''.
*''[[Countdown to Final Crisis]]'' is a weekly series that is actually a lead in to yet another crisis, ''[[Final Crisis]]''. It does not take place immediately after ''[[52 (comics)|52]]''; it actually, chronologically speaking, takes place concurrently with the comics DC was publishing at the time, over a year (in real world time, less in internal comic book time) after the One Year Gap.

===Series canceled during the crossover===
A number of series were canceled with the "One Year Later" jump. Some ended outright, like ''[[Batgirl]]'', ''[[Gotham Central]]'', and ''[[Batman: Gotham Knights]]'', while others were suspended and restarted later with new volumes, notably ''[[Justice League|JLA]]'', ''[[Justice Society|JSA]]'', ''[[Flash (comics)|Flash]]'', and ''[[Wonder Woman]]''. Additionally, ''[[The Adventures of Superman (comic book)|Adventures of Superman]]'' returned to its original title of ''Superman'', while the book that had previously been coming out as ''Superman'' since 1987 was canceled, thus making the Superman line's two books, ''Superman'' and ''Action Comics'', match the Batman lines ''Batman'' and ''Detective Comics'' (in addition to the shared title ''[[Superman/Batman|Batman and Superman]]''.)

==Adaptations==
[[Ace Books]], under the imprint of the [[Berkley Publishing Group]] and published by the [[Penguin Group]], released an October 2006 novelization adaption of the series written by [[Greg Cox (writer)|Greg Cox]], with an introduction by [[Mark Waid]], and cover art designed by Georg Brewer and illustrated by [[Daniel Acuña]].&lt;ref&gt;Cox, Greg. ''Infinite Crisis'' (October 2006) Ace Books. {{ISBN|0-441-01444-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; The novel was primarily adapted from the seven-issues mini-series published by [[DC Comics]] (December 2005 to June 2006). Additional materials on the book was adapted from:

*''Aquaman'' #37 (February 2006)
*''Day of Vengeance: Infinite Crisis Special'' (March 2006)
*''Gotham Central'' # 38 (February 2006)
*''JLA'' #119 (November 2005)
*''JSA Classified'' #4 (December 2005)
*''Rann/Thanagar War: Infinite Crisis Special'' (April 2006)
*''Teen Titans'' #32 (March 2006)
*''Wonder Woman'' (vol. 2) #223–224 (January and February 2006)

GraphicAudio produced an audiobook of the novelization of ''Infinite Crisis''. The audiobook spans two volumes with 6 CDs each and features a full cast, music and sound effects. Volume 1 released May 2007 runs 6 hours, and Volume 2 released June 2007 runs 7 hours.

===Video game===
{{main|Infinite Crisis (video game)}}

In March 25, 2013, [[WB Games]] and [[DC Comics]] announced a [[multiplayer online battle arena]] video game adaptation loosely based on the comic book series. The game was developed by [[Turbine, Inc.]]

'''Italia Turrita''' ({{IPA-it|iˈtaːlja turˈriːta|pron}}) is the [[national personification]] or [[allegory]] of [[Italy]], characterised by a [[mural crown]] (hence ''turrita'' or "with towers" in [[Italian language|Italian]]) typical of Italian civic [[heraldry]] of [[Medieval commune|Medieval communal]] origin. In broader terms, the crown symbolizes its mostly urban history. She often holds in her hands a bunch of corn ears (a symbol of fertility and reference to the agrarian economy); during the [[Italian fascism|fascist era]], she held a [[fascio littorio|bundle of fasces]].

== History ==
Italy’s first allegory, a laurel-crowned female head, appears on the coins coined during the [[Social War (91–88 BC)|Social War]] between the [[Roman Republic]] and several other cities of [[Central Italy]] from 91 to 88 BC. Under the emperor [[Augustus]], an allegorical representation of Italy known as ''Saturnia Tellus'' was sculpted in marble on ''[[Ara Pacis]]’'' external wall (13-9 BC) in Rome. Another allegory of Italy appears on the coins coined during the reign of emperor [[Nerva]] in 97 AD.

The representation of ''Italia turrita'' was proposed under the emperor [[Trajan]], who wanted it to be sculpted on the [[Arch of Trajan (Benevento)|Trajan’s Arch]] erected in [[Benevento]] in 114-117, and also on one of the two ''Pluteos'' called ''anaglypha'', four years later. Afterwards, from 130 AD on, under the emperors [[Hadrian]], [[Antoninus Pius]], [[Marcus Aurelius]], [[Commodus]], [[Septimius Severus]] and [[Caracalla]], Roman coins reproduced the allegorical representation of Italy as a dressed and towered woman who sometimes carries a cornucopia. The towered crown is the symbol of ''[[Civitas]] romana'', therefore the allegory shows the sovereignty of the Italian peninsula as a land of free cities and of Roman citizens to whom a proper right has been granted: the ''[[Ius Italicum]]''.

This mythographical setting-up of the Italian land became also popular during the Middle Ages. In 1490, [[Ludovico Sforza]], duke of Milan, had an ''Italia turrita'' painted on a medallion of the castle in Piazza Ducale, [[Vigevano]]. The ''Caesaris Astrum'' appeared again in 1574 on the cover of ''Historiarium de Regno Italiae'', a book written by the historian [[Carlo Sigonio]].

== Stella d'Italia ==
{{main|Stella d’Italia}}
Over her head, a five-pointed star is usually seen shining radiant; an ancient secular symbol of Italy purported to protect the nation, known as ''Stella d'Italia'' or Star of Italy. Iconographic of the [[Risorgimento]], it was used as the [[crest (heraldry)|crest]] of the [[armorial bearings]] of the [[Kingdom of Italy (1861–1946)|Kingdom of Italy]] from 1870 to 1890 and is the dominant element in the modern day emblem of Italy adopted at the [[Italian constitutional referendum, 1946|birth of the Italian Republic]] in 1948.

'''Main lesson''' or '''main lesson block''' refers to a subject lesson or topic that is taught more intensely for a period of several (often three or four) weeks. The main lesson period is usually the first period of the day and typically lasts 100 to 120 minutes.

The topic of the main lesson is taught daily during that period but can connect different subjects if the topic allows for exploration from the perspectives of different subjects.
The concept is primarily used in [[Waldorf education|Waldorf pedagogy]].

'''Matkot''' ({{lang-he|מטקות}} lit. "racquets") is a popular [[Padel (sport)|Padel ball]] game in [[Israel]] similar to [[beach tennis]], often referred to by Israelis as their national beach sport.&lt;ref name="Fogelman"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.haaretz.com/hasen/spages/1099549.html |title=Beach Paddle Battle |author=Fogelman, Shay |work=Haaretz |date=2009-07-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=Yolande | last=Knell | url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/magazine-22907051 | title=Matkot madness: Israel's extreme bat and ball beach craze | work=[[BBC News Online]], Magazine | date=16 June 2013 | accessdate=16 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;
==History==
[[Image:Playing matkot.jpg|thumb|Player poised to hit the ball]] 
Matkot has been played on the Israeli beaches since the 1920s.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424127887324077704578361030085523620 In Israel, sounds of spring include thwack of paddleballs]&lt;/ref&gt; Early documentation of the game includes a 1932 Tel Aviv beach scene by Israeli artist [[Nahum Gutman]] showing two young men holding rounded paddles and hitting a ball back and forth on the beach.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jpost.com/Local-Israel/Tel-Aviv-And-Center/Meshugas-for-matkot Meshugas for matkot]&lt;/ref&gt;

The goal of the game is to hit a small rubber ball with a wooden racket as many times as possible without dropping it.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2012/06/30/travel/looking-to-play-some-matkot-tel-avivs-the-place.html Looking to Play Some Matkot? Tel Aviv’s the Place]&lt;/ref&gt; Two or more players hit the ball back and forth  using paddles.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.touristisrael.com/tel-aviv-beaches/387/ Tel Aviv beaches]&lt;/ref&gt; The sport is named after the racquet, the ''matka''; the origin of this word is unclear.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Rosenthal|first=Ruvik|title=Dictionary of Israeli Slang|year=2005|publisher=Keter|location=Jerusalem|isbn=965-07-1401-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!-- If you have a reliable source for an etymology, feel free to add it, but don't add any guesses. --&gt;

The racquets are traditionally made of wood, although sometimes the handles are reinforced with a plastic covering. Carbon fiber is also used. The head of a racquet may vary somewhat in size and shape. The heads are circular and about {{convert|30|cm|in}} in diameter. The racquet handles are short, and with very little trunk between the handle and the racquet head. 

The standard ball used is the same ball as is used in [[Squash (sport)|squash]]. However, novice and intermediate players sometimes use a ball that is similar in size to a squash ball, but lighter and/or bouncier.

The game has developed a moderate level of popularity outside of Israel as a participatory sport, particularly where there is either a strong beach culture (e.g. [[Brazil]], where it is also highly popular, but more commonly known as frescoball), or a significant number of Israelis living abroad (e.g. [[Thailand]]).&lt;ref&gt;[http://sussle.org/t/Matkot]&lt;/ref&gt;

The first Israeli matkot competition was held in 2000, capped by a national championship in Tel Aviv.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424127887324077704578361030085523620 In Israel, sounds of spring include thwack of paddleballs]&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Mobile Electronic Certified Professional''' (MECP) is a certificate of achievement program in the United States that it is managed and administered by the [[Consumer Electronics Association]] (CEA).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mecp.com/Home.aspx|title=Mobile Electronics Certified Professional - My Site|work=mecp.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; The purpose of this certification is to ensure that individuals who install after-market electronics into vehicles and other vessels (such as aircraft or watercraft) do so in a consistent, safe, and reliable manner. Designed for mobile electronics installers, MECP certification training teaches the theory and practice of the 12-volt electronics industry. Exam questions and course content focus on "real-world" scenarios such as "eliminating noise, selecting proper gauge wires, determining ground locations and dealing with customer issues."&lt;ref name="Training"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ce.org/Training.aspx |title=Training |publisher=Consume Electronics Association |accessdate=10 July 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120622004622/http://www.ce.org/Training.aspx |archivedate=22 June 2012 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Major organizations such as [[Best Buy]] subsidiary [[Geek Squad]] has adopted the MECP into its job requirements.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.geeksquad.com/careers/car-autotech/mecp-advanced-certified.aspx|title=MECP Advanced Certified|work=geeksquad.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are four levels of certification offered through CEA, including three technical certifications of varying degrees, and one sales certification.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mecp.com/FAQ.aspx|title=Mobile Electronics Certified Professional - My Site|work=mecp.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1805">The '''mythology of Oceania''' and the gods of the [[Pacific Ocean|Pacific region]] are both complex and diverse.  They have been developed over many centuries on each of the islands and atolls that make up [[Oceania]]. Some gods are shared between many groups of islands while others are specific to one set of islands or even to a single island. Their exact roles are often overlapping as one god can appear in different places under different names. A god can also appear in many different forms.

'''The National Library of Bhutan''' ('''NLB''') (Dzongkha: ''Druk Gyelyong Pedzö'' འབྲུག་རྒྱལ་ཡོངས་དཔེ་མཛོད།), [[Thimphu]], [[Bhutan]] was established in 1967 for the purpose of "preservation and promotion of the rich cultural and religious heritage" of Bhutan. It is located in the Kawajangtsa area of Thimphu, above the Royal Thimphu Golf Course, near the [[Folk Heritage Museum]] and the National Institute for Zorig Chusum (Traditional Arts and Crafts).

==History==
[[File:National Library and Archives, Bhutan, 2014-05-14.jpg|right|thumb|300px|The National Library and Archives of Bhutan.]]

The National Library of Bhutan was first established in 1967 under the patronage of HM Queen Ashi Phuntso Choden (1911–2003), with a small collection of precious texts. The library was initially housed within the central tower (utse) of [[Tashichodzong]]. Later, due to its growing collection, it had to move to a building in the Changgangkha area of [[Thimphu]].

To provide a permanent home for the sacred religious books and manuscripts in the growing collection,  construction of the present four-storeyed eight-cornered traditional building, which looks like the central tower temple of a Bhutanese [[Dzong]], in the Kawajangtsa area of Thimphu was initiated. The cost of the construction of this building  was borne entirely by the Royal Government of Bhutan without any foreign aid.

This building, which houses the collection of traditional texts, was inaugurated and consecrated as a temple by [[Dilgo Khyentse|H.H. Dilgo Khyentse Rinpoche]] on November 23, 1984 in order to provide a sacred space for the religious books which form the bulk of the collection. The library moved into its permanent home at the end of 1984 under the auspices of the then Special Commission for Cultural Affairs.

==National Archives&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.library.gov.bt/archive/index.html|title=National Library &amp; Archives of Bhutan: Archives|website=www.library.gov.bt|access-date=2017-06-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;==

The National Archives is responsible for collecting and preserving important past, present and future documents on [[Bhutan]] for future generations.

In July 2000 [[Denmark]] signed an agreement to support the National Archives to provide assistance for the construction of a modern archive building. This two storied building, which was completed in 2004 is equipped with a modern security and fire alarm system as well as temperature and humidity control.

===Our National Memory Bank===

The repository rooms of the archives now house many important documents including old records, old letters and around seven thousand important photographs. The archives also hold [[microfilms]] of many other important documents. Particularly rare and important books and manuscripts from the National Library collection are also kept in their secure and controlled facilities. Thus the archives is the foundation of our National Memory Bank.

The National Archives solicits co-operation from all concerned in its effort to create our National Memory Bank. We therefore request individuals and institutions, inside and outside the country holding important documents and other material related to [[Bhutan]] which may be of interest to future generations, to provide copies for our National Archives.

===Microfilming Facility &amp; Service===

The National Library offers a free microfilming service for institutions and individuals within Bhutan holding important and rare texts and documents. They actively encourage anyone holding such documents to bring them to the library for microfilming in order to ensure the [[long term preservation]] of the contents of these documents should anything happen to the original. Upon microfilming the original text or document will be returned to the provider along with one microfilm copy, and one copy will be held in the archives in safe and secure controlled storage conditions.

===Conservation &amp; Preservation===

The archives primarily deals with paper documents. Paper is composed of organic materials which deteriorate with the passage of time. Documents printed on modern paper often contain bleaches and other chemicals which can speed up this deterioration. Similarly photographs and film often contains chemical traces left over from processing which can cause deterioration. Therefore, when documents or photographs are selected for preservation it is important that they are treated to neutralize these harmful [[chemical residue]]s.

=== [http://www.library.gov.bt/archive/LegalDepositAct.html Legal Deposit Act] ===
National Assembly of Bhutan hereby enacts this Legal Deposit Act: An Act to Collect, Preserve and Manage Bhutan’s Documentary Heritage in July 20, 1999 to legally collect and save print, non-print, electronic, audio visual and electronic texts, all the forms of documents that relate to the Bhutan and national interests. There are eight parts in the Legal Deposit Act.

===Future Plans===
In the 10th five-year plan the National Archives plans to carry out a nationwide survey to determine where records of national importance are located; and in what form, shape and condition these records are being maintained. If such records are not being taken care of properly we will endeavour to assist the owners and custodians of these records to ensure their proper preservation.

They also plan to create special Oral History Tradition and Audio Visual Unit to survey, create and maintain Oral History and Audio Visual documentation for the nation.

==Highlights of the collections==
*Longchenpa's Seven Treasuries - (Longchen Dzo Dun) - The complete set of printing blocks for the  edition of the [[Seven Treasuries]] originally commissioned by Dodrup Chen Rinpoche in Gangtok (c. 1968) are now held at the National Library of Bhutan and re-printed from time to time on Bhutanese paper.
* Collected Works of Padma Karpo (Kunkhyen Ka-bum) - A complete set of xylographic printing blocks of the complete works of [[Kunkhyen Pema Karpo|Kunkhyen Padma Karpo]] are held at the National Library of Bhutan and re-printed from time to time.

'''''Newhart''''' is an American [[sitcom]] that aired on [[CBS]] from October 25, 1982, to May 21, 1990, with a total of 184 half-hour episodes spanning over eight seasons. The series stars [[Bob Newhart]] and [[Mary Frann]] as an author and wife, respectively, who own and operate an inn located in a small, rural [[Vermont]] town that is home to many eccentric characters. ''[[TV Guide]]'', [[TV Land]], and [[A&amp;E (TV channel)|A&amp;E]] named the ''Newhart'' series finale as one of the most memorable in television history. ''Newhart'' was recorded on videotape for Season 1, with the remaining seasons shot on film. The theme music for ''Newhart'' was composed by [[Henry Mancini]].

==Premise==
Bob Newhart plays Dick Loudon, an author of [[do-it-yourself]] and travel books. He and his wife Joanna move from New York City to a small town in rural Vermont to operate the 200-year-old Stratford Inn. (Although the town's name was never specified in the show, some media sources identified it as [[Norwich, Vermont|Norwich]].)&lt;ref&gt;[http://articles.latimes.com/1990-05-20/news/tv-107_1_bob-newhart "Bye Bye, Bob : There's No One Left at the Inn as 'Newhart' Signs Off"]. ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'', May 20, 1990.&lt;/ref&gt;

Dick is a sane, mild-mannered everyman surrounded by a community of oddballs in a town that exists in an illogical world governed by rules that elude him. Near the end of the second season, Dick began hosting a low-rated talk show on the town's [[local television]] station. As the series progressed, episodes focused increasingly on Dick's TV career and the quirky townsfolk.

[[File:Newhartfinale.jpg|right|thumb|(Top) Dick Loudon is hit by a golf ball. (Bottom) Dr. Robert Hartley wakes up and tells his wife about the dream he had, of living in an inn in Vermont.]]

The [[series finale]] of ''Newhart'', titled "The Last Newhart", has been described as one of the most memorable in television history.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=100 most memorable TV moments|url=http://www.tvland.com/originals/100moments/page4.jhtml|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20041215031537/http://www.tvland.com/originals/100moments/page4.jhtml|dead-url=yes|archive-date=December 15, 2004|accessdate=17 January 2017|df=mdy-all}} &lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Karol2006"&gt;{{cite book|last=Karol|first=Michael|title=Sitcom Queens: Divas of the Small Screen|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=9z7tMWnJC0AC&amp;pg=PA118|accessdate=February 28, 2011|date=July 2006|publisher=iUniverse|isbn=978-0-595-40251-9|page=118}}&lt;/ref&gt; The entire town is purchased by a visiting Japanese tycoon, who turns the hamlet into an enormous golf course and recreation resort. Dick and Joanna are the only townspeople who refuse to leave. The others accept huge payoffs and leave in a farewell scene that parodies ''[[Fiddler on the Roof]]''.

Five years later, Dick and Joanna continue to run the Stratford Inn, which is now located in the middle of the golf course. The other townspeople, now richer and older than before, unexpectedly return for a reunion. The Darryl brothers also speak for the first time on screen, loudly yelling "Quiet!" at their wives in unison. Dick gets frustrated with the increasingly chaotic scene, and storms out shouting "You're all crazy!", only to be knocked out by an errantly struck golf ball.

The setting of the last scene is nighttime, in the bedroom of Dr. Bob Hartley (''[[The Bob Newhart Show]]'') and his wife Emily ([[Suzanne Pleshette]]). Hartley awakens, upset, and he wakes Emily to tell her about the very strange dream he has just had: that he was an innkeeper in a small Vermont town filled with eccentric characters and married to a beautiful blonde. Emily tells him he can not have Japanese food before bed anymore.

Several references are made to Newhart's former show, including the use of its theme song and credits. Although the ''Bob Newhart Show'' theme was missing from the final closing credit shot in the series' initial syndication run, the theme has been reinstated in the current version syndicated by [[20th Century Fox Television]].

The MTM cat logo normally closed the show [[end credits]] with Newhart voicing-over the "meow", but for the finale, the cat's voiceover was a reprise of Darryl and Darryl yelling "Quiet!"

===Reception to the finale===
Interviews with Newhart, Pleshette, and director [[Dick Martin (comedian)|Dick Martin]]&lt;ref name="emmytvlegends.org"&gt;{{cite web|title=Newhart: The Last Newhart|url=http://www.emmytvlegends.org/interviews/shows/newhart-the-last-newhart|website=Archive of American Television|accessdate=17 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; reveal that the final scene was kept a secret from the cast and most of the crew. A fake ending was written to throw off the [[Tabloid journalism|tabloids]] that involved Dick Loudon going to heaven after being hit with a golf ball and talking to God played by [[George Burns]] or [[George C. Scott]]. Pleshette was kept hidden until her scene was shot. When the scene began, many people in the live audience recognized the set as the bedroom from ''The Bob Newhart Show'' and burst into spontaneous applause. Pleshette and Newhart did the scene in one take.&lt;ref name="emmytvlegends.org"/&gt;

In 1991, the cast of ''The Bob Newhart Show'' reunited in a primetime special. One of the things they did was analyze Bob's dream. During the discussion, the Hartleys' neighbor, Howard Borden ([[Bill Daily]]), quipped, "I had a dream like that once. I dreamed I was an astronaut in Florida for five seasons", while scenes were shown from ''[[I Dream of Jeannie]]'', which featured Daily in all five seasons. At the end of the reunion special, Dr. Bob Hartley gets on the elevator only to see three familiar workmen doing repairs in the elevator and one of them says to Bob, "Hi. I'm Larry. This is my brother Darryl and this is my other brother Darryl."

In his book ''I Shouldn't Even Be Doing This! And Other Things that Strike Me as Funny'', Newhart stated that his wife Ginnie proposed the ending of ''Newhart''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Newhart|first1=Bob|authorlink1=Bob Newhart|title=I Shouldn't Even Be Doing This! And Other Things that Strike Me as Funny|date=2006|publisher=Hyperion|location=New York|isbn=1401302467|pages=225–26 |edition=1st}}&lt;/ref&gt; He reiterated this in a 2013 interview with director and comedian [[David Steinberg]], saying,
{{quote|That was Ginnie's idea. ... She said, 'You ought to end in a dream sequence because there was so much inexplicable about the show.' She said, 'You should wake up in bed with Susie and explain what's so—" and I said, 'What a great idea,' and I gave the idea to the writers and they fleshed it out with the Japanese buying the town and our not selling."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite episode | title = Bob Newhart and Louis C.K. | series = Inside Comedy | network = [[Showtime (TV channel)|Showtime]] | airdate = 16 February 2013 | season = 2 | number = 1 | accessdate = 19 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

In a letter-to-the-editor published in ''[[Entertainment Weekly]]'', the show's executive producers, Mark Egan, Mark Solomon, and Bob Bendetson, wrote, "[T]he final episode of ''Newhart'' was not 'dreamed up' by Bob's wife, Ginny. She had absolutely no connection with the show. ... We wrote and produced the Emmy-nominated script (with special thanks to [[Dan O'Shannon]])."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,297454,00.html |title=Mail Page |work=[[Entertainment Weekly]] (ew.com) |accessdate=March 23, 2009 |date=June 2, 1995 | archivedate = October 11, 2012 | deadurl = no | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20121011112448/http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,297454,00.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In November 2005, the series finale was named by ''TV Guide'' and TV Land as the most unexpected moment in TV history.{{Citation needed|date=June 2010}} The episode was watched by 29.5 million viewers, bringing in an 18.7/29 rating/share, and ranking as the most-watched program that week.

In 2011, the finale was ranked number four on the [[TV Guide Network]] special, ''TV's Most Unforgettable Finales'',&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite episode |series=TV's Most Unforgettable Finales |network=TV Guide Network |airdate=May 22, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; and in 2013 was ranked number 1 in [[Entertainment Weekly]]'s ''20 Best TV Series Finales Ever''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ew.com/tv/20-best-tv-series-finales-ever/20|title=Entertainment Weekly's EW.com|work=Entertainment Weekly's EW.com|accessdate=6 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====In popular culture====
On the February 11, 1995, episode of ''[[Saturday Night Live]]'' which was [[Saturday Night Live (season 20)|hosted by Bob Newhart]], the episode's closing sketch ended with a redux of ''Newhart'''s final scene, in which Bob Hartley again wakes with his wife Emily (special guest Suzanne Pleshette) and tells her that he had just had a dream of hosting ''Saturday Night Live''. Emily responds, "''Saturday Night Live'', is that show still on?"—this during a period when ''SNL'' was heavily criticized for its declining quality.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Newcomb|first1=Horace|title=Encyclopedia of Television|date=2004|publisher=Fitzroy Dearborn|isbn=1579583946|page=278}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | url = http://nymag.com/arts/tv/features/47548/ | title = Comedy Isn't Funny: Saturday Night Live at twenty – how the show that transformed TV became a grim joke | work = [[New York (magazine)|New York Magazine]] | first = Chris | last = Smith | date = 1995-03-13 |accessdate=2015-02-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2010, ''[[Jimmy Kimmel Live!]]'' presented several parody alternate endings to the television show ''[[Lost (TV series)|Lost]]'', one of which mirrored the finale of ''Newhart'' complete with a cameo appearance by Bob Newhart and with ''Lost'' star [[Evangeline Lilly]] in place of Emily/Pleshette.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://blogs.wsj.com/speakeasy/2010/05/24/lost-ending-jimmy-kimmel-and-the-parodies/|title=‘Lost’ Ending: Jimmy Kimmel and the Parodies|author=WSJ Staff|work=WSJ|accessdate=April 20, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The final scene with Newhart and Pleshette was later parodied in an alternate ending to the television series ''[[Breaking Bad]]'' where actor [[Bryan Cranston]] wakes from a dream next to his ''[[Malcolm in the Middle]]'' co-star [[Jane Kaczmarek]] where they assume their respective roles of Hal and Lois. Hal recounts the events of ''Breaking Bad'' in humorous fashion as though he is horrified that he could do those things albeit as [[Walter White (Breaking Bad)|Walter White]]. Lois reassures him that everything is all right and the final shot is of Walter's hat.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Breaking Bad' Reveals Wonderful Alternate Ending With 'Malcolm In The Middle,' Jane Kaczmarek |publisher=Huffington Post |date=2013-11-18 |author=Chris Harnick |url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/11/17/breaking-bad-alternate-ending-jane-kaczmarek_n_4291566.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The final scene of ''[[The Late Late Show with Craig Ferguson]]'' parodied this, as well. After revealing that Bob Newhart had been playing the on-set [[pantomime horse]] Secretariat, Ferguson wakes up as his ''[[The Drew Carey Show]]'' character Nigel Wick, in bed with his co-star [[Drew Carey]]. The two then discuss the crazy possibility of Wick being a talk show host and Carey losing weight and becoming a game show host. (The shot continued with a parody of the twist ending of ''St. Elsewhere'' and then the [[Don't Stop Believin'|closing song]] from ''[[The Sopranos]]'' [[Made in America (The Sopranos)|finale]].)

==Reception==

{{unreferenced section|date=July 2017}}
''Newhart'' was a solid ratings winner, finishing six out of eight seasons in the [[Nielsen ratings|Nielsen]] top 25 at its highest rating of number 12 for two consecutive seasons from 1986 to 1988. Despite not finishing in the top 30 for its last two seasons, Bob Newhart stated in an interview with the [[Archive of American Television]] that CBS was satisfied enough with the show's ratings to renew it for a ninth season in 1990. However, Newhart, who was anxious to move onto other projects, declined the offer,  promising CBS that he would develop a new series for the network, which he was under contract to do. This resulted in the 1992 series ''[[Bob (TV series)|Bob]]'', which lasted for two seasons.

'''Patriarchy''' is a [[social system]] in which males hold primary power and predominate in roles of political leadership, [[moral authority]], [[social privilege]] and control of property. Some patriarchal societies are also [[patrilineal]], meaning that property and title are inherited by the male lineage.

Patriarchy is associated with a set of ideas, a patriarchal [[ideology]] that acts to explain and justify this dominance and attributes it to inherent natural differences between men and women. Sociologists tend to see patriarchy as a social product and not as an outcome of innate differences between the sexes and they focus attention on the way that [[gender role]]s in a society affect power differentials between men and women.&lt;ref name=":2"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Henslin"/&gt;

Historically, patriarchy has manifested itself in the social, legal, political, religious, and economic organization of a range of different cultures.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last= Malti-Douglas |first=Fedwa |title=Encyclopedia of Sex and Gender |year=2007 |publisher= Macmillan |location=Detroit |isbn=0-02-865960-0}}{{Page needed |date=October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Even if not explicitly defined to be by their own constitutions and laws, most contemporary societies are, in practice, patriarchal.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Societies, Networks, and Transitions |volume=1 |last=Lockard |first=Craig |publisher=Cengage Learning |year=2007 |isbn=9780547047669 |location= |pages=111–114 |quote="Today, as in the past, men generally hold political, economic, and religious power in most societies." }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|encyclopedia=The Wiley Blackwell Encyclopedia of Gender and Sexuality Studies|first1=Carole|last1=Pateman|title=Sexual Contract|url=https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/9781118663219.wbegss468|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons, Ltd|year=2016|location=Singapore|isbn=978-1-4051-9694-9|doi=10.1002/9781118663219.wbegss468}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Historically, the term ''patriarchy'' was used to refer to [[autocratic]] rule by the male head of a family.

[[Marxist]] theory, as articulated mainly by [[Friedrich Engels]], assigns the origin of patriarchy to the emergence of [[private property]], which has traditionally been controlled by men. In this view, men directed household production and sought to control women in order to ensure the passing of family property to their own (male) offspring, while women were limited to household labor and producing children.{{refn|name=Cannell &amp; Green}}{{refn|name=Gardiner}}&lt;ref name="Bryson"&gt;{{cite book |last=Bryson |first=Valerie |editor1=Kramarae, Cheris |editor2=Spender, Dale |title=Routledge International Encyclopedia of Women: Global Women's Issues and Knowledge, Volume 2 |date=2000 |location=New York; Abingdon, UK |isbn=978-0-41-5-92088-9 |page=791 |chapterurl=https://books.google.com/books/about/Routledge_International_Encyclopedia_of.html?id=QAOUAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT850&amp;dq=patriarchy |chapter=Feminism: Marxist}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lerner disputes this idea, arguing that patriarchy emerged before the development of class-based society and the concept of private property.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/13323175|title=The creation of patriarchy|last=1920-2013.|first=Lerner, Gerda,|date=1986|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=0195039963|location=New York|oclc=13323175}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Domination by men of women is found in the [[Ancient Near East]] as far back as 3100 BCE, as are restrictions on a woman's reproductive capacity and exclusion from "the process of representing or the construction of history".&lt;ref name="Strozier"/&gt; According to some researchers, with the appearance of the [[Hebrews]], there is also "the exclusion of woman from the God-humanity covenant".&lt;ref name="Strozier"/&gt;&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite book |last=Lerner |first=Gerda |year=1986 |url=https://books.google.com/books?&amp;id=Zc318kI-TPMC |title=The Creation of Patriarchy |publisher=Oxford University Press |series=Women and History |isbn=978-0195039962 |pages=8–11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The archaeologist [[Marija Gimbutas]] argues that waves of [[kurgan hypothesis|kurgan]]-building invaders from the Ukrainian steppes into the early agricultural cultures of [[Old Europe (archaeology)|Old Europe]] in the Aegean, the Balkans and southern Italy instituted male hierarchies that led to the rise of patriarchy in [[Western society]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Gimbutas |first=Marija | chapter = The end of Old Europe: the intrusion of Steppe Pastoralists from South Russia and the transformation of Europe | chapterurl = https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=ktftAAAAMAAJ |title=The Civilization of the Goddess: The World of Old Europe | pages = 351&amp;ndash;510 |publisher=Harper Collins | location = San Francisco, California |year=1992 |isbn=978-0062503374}}&lt;/ref&gt; Steven Taylor argues that the rise of patriarchal domination was associated with the appearance of socially stratified hierarchical polities, institutionalised violence and the separated individuated ego associated with a period of climatic stress.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Taylor |first=Steven | chapter = What's wrong with human beings? | chapterurl = https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=mSPtBAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT12 |title=The Fall: The Insanity of the Ego in Human History | pages = 17&amp;ndash;19 | publisher = O Books | location = Winchester | year = 2005 | isbn = 978-1905047208 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Ancient history===
A prominent Greek general [[Meno (general)|Meno]], in the Platonic dialogue of the same name, sums up the prevailing sentiment in [[Classical Greece]] about the respective virtues of men and women. He says:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=W.R.M. Lamb, |title=Plato in Twelve Volumes |volume=3 |location=Cambridge, Massachusetts |publisher=Harvard University Press |date=1967 |chapter=71E: Meno |url=http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus:text:1999.01.0178:text=Meno:section=71e |accessdate=9 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;
{{quote | First of all, if you take the virtue of a man, it is easily stated that a man's virtue is this—that he be competent to manage the affairs of his city, and to manage them so as to benefit his friends and harm his enemies, and to take care to avoid suffering harm himself. Or take a woman's virtue: there is no difficulty in describing it as the duty of ordering the house well, looking after the property indoors, and obeying her husband. | Meno | Plato in Twelve Volumes}}

The works of [[Aristotle]] portrayed women as morally, intellectually, and physically inferior to men; saw women as the property of men; claimed that women's role in society was to reproduce and to serve men in the household; and saw male domination of women as natural and virtuous.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Fishbein, Harold D.|title=Peer prejudice and discrimination: the origins of prejudice|edition= 2nd|publisher=Psychology Press|date=2002|isbn=978-0-8058-3772-8|page=27|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=HBwAYLFPP3sC&amp;pg=PA27}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Dubber, Markus Dirk|title=The police power: patriarchy and the foundations of American government|publisher=Columbia University Press|date=2005|isbn=978-0-231-13207-7|pages=5–7|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=cjdbRF8PXhUC&amp;pg=PA5}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|author=Bar On, Bat-Ami|title=Engendering origins: critical feminist readings in Plato and Aristotle|publisher=SUNY Press|date=1994|isbn=978-0-7914-1643-3|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=6UVq3z2Kd6cC}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Gerda Lerner]], author of ''The Creation of Patriarchy,'' states that Aristotle believed that women had colder blood than men, which made women not evolve into men, the sex that Aristotle believed to be perfect and superior. Maryanne Cline Horowitz stated that Aristotle believed that "soul contributes the form and model of creation". This implies that any imperfection that is caused in the world must be caused by a woman because one cannot acquire an imperfection from perfection (which he perceived as male). Aristotle had a hierarchical ruling structure in his theories. Lerner claims that through this patriarchal belief system, passed down generation to generation, people have been conditioned to believe that men are superior to women. These symbols are benchmarks which children learn about when they grow up, and the cycle of patriarchy continues much past the Greeks.&lt;ref name="Lerner1986"&gt;{{cite book |last=Lerner, |first=Gerda |date=1986 |title=The Creation of Patriarchy |location=New York |publisher=Oxford University Press |chapter=Chapter 10: Symbols}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Egypt]] left no philosophical record, but [[Herodotus]] left a record of his shock at the contrast between the roles of Egyptian women and the women of Athens. He observed that Egyptian women attended market and were employed in [[trade]]. In ancient Egypt, middle-class women were eligible to sit on a local [[tribunal]], engage in [[real estate]] transactions, and inherit or bequeath [[property]]. Women also secured loans, and witnessed legal documents. Athenian women were denied such rights.&lt;ref&gt;Ptahhotep, trans. John A. Wilson.

Greek influence spread, however, with the conquests of [[Alexander the Great]], who was educated by Aristotle.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Bristow |first=John Temple |title=What Paul Really Said About Women: an Apostle's liberating views on equality in marriage, leadership, and love |location=New York |date=1991 |publisher=HarperOne |isbn=978-0060610630}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During this time period in China, gender roles and patriarchy remained shaped by Confucianism. Adopted as the official religion in the [[Han dynasty]], Confucianism has strong dictates regarding the behavior of women, declaring a woman's place in society, as well as outlining virtuous behavior.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Adler|first=Joseph A.|date=Winter 2006|title=Daughter/Wife/Mother or Sage/Immortal/Bodhisattva?

It explains that an obedient woman is to obey their father before her marriage, her husband after marriage, and her first son if widowed, and that a virtuous woman must practice sexual propriety, proper speech, modest appearance, and hard work.&lt;ref&gt;LARGEN, KRISTIN JOHNSTON. “A Brief Introduction to Confucianism.” ''Finding God Among Our Neighbors: An Interfaith Systematic Theology'', Augsburg Fortress, Publishers, Minneapolis, 2017, pp. 61–88. ''JSTOR'', www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt1ggjhm3.7.&lt;/ref&gt; Ban Zhao, a Confucian disciple, writes in her book ''Precepts for Women'', that a woman's primary concern is to subordinate themselves before patriarchal figures such as a husband or father, and that they need not concern themselves with intelligence or talent.&lt;ref&gt;Gao, Xiongya. “Women Existing for Men: Confucianism and Social Injustice against Women in China.” ''Race, Gender &amp; Class'', vol. 10, no. 3, 2003, pp. 114–125. ''JSTOR'', JSTOR, www.jstor.org/stable/41675091.&lt;/ref&gt; Ban Zhao is considered by some historians as an early champion for women's education in China, however her extensive writing on the value of a woman's mediocrity and servile behavior leaves others feeling that this narrative is the result of a misplaced desire to cast her in a contemporary feminist light.&lt;ref&gt;Goldin, Paul R. “Ban Zhao in Her Time and in Ours.” ''After Confucius: Studies in Early Chinese Philosophy'', University of Hawai'i Press, Honolulu, 2005, pp. 112–118. ''JSTOR'', www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt1wn0qtj.11.&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly to ''Three Obediences and Four Virtues'', ''Precepts for Women'' was meant as a moral guide for proper feminine behavior, and was widely accepted as such for centuries.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/42922667|title=Technology and gender : fabrics of power in late imperial China|last=Francesca.|first=Bray,|date=1997|publisher=University of California Press|isbn=9780520919006|location=Berkeley|oclc=42922667}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although many 16th and 17th century theorists agreed with Aristotle's views concerning the place of women in society, none of them tried to prove political obligation on the basis of the patriarchal family until sometime after 1680. The patriarchal political theory is closely associated with Sir [[Robert Filmer]]. Sometime before 1653, Filmer completed a work entitled ''Patriarcha''. However, it was not published until after his death. In it, he defended the divine right of kings as having title inherited from [[Adam]], the first man of the human species, according to [[Judeo-Christian]] tradition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|last=Gordon|first=Schochet|title=Patriarchy and Paternalism|encyclopedia=Europe, 1450 to 1789: Encyclopedia of the Early Modern World|date=2004|publisher=Charles Scribner's Sons|isbn=068431200X}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, in the latter half of the 18th century, clerical sentiments of patriarchy were meeting challenges from intellectual authorities – [[Diderot]]'s [[Encyclopedia]] denies inheritance of paternal authority stating, "... reason shows us that mothers have rights and authority equal to those of fathers; for the obligations imposed on children originate equally from the mother and the father, as both are equally responsible for bringing them into the world. Thus the positive laws of God that relate to the obedience of children join the father and the mother without any differentiation; both possess a kind of ascendancy and jurisdiction over their children...."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Encyclopedie, Paternal Authority|url=http://quod.lib.umich.edu/d/did/did2222.0000.040/--paternal-authority?rgn=main;view=fulltext;q1=education|publisher=Digital Library Platform &amp; Services (DLPS), University of Michigan |accessdate=1 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 19th century, various women began to question the commonly accepted patriarchal interpretation of Christian scripture. One of the foremost of these was [[Sarah Grimké]], who voiced skepticism about the ability of men to translate and interpret passages relating to the roles of the sexes without bias. She proposed alternative translations and interpretations of passages relating to women, and she applied historical and cultural criticism to a number of verses, arguing that their admonitions applied to specific historical situations, and were not to be viewed as universal commands.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Durso|first=Pamela R.|title=The Power of Woman: The Life and writings of Sarah Moore Grimké|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=aQFTJJgK8esC&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|date=2003|publisher=Mercer University Press|location=Macon, Ga.|isbn=978-0-86554-876-3|pages=130–138|edition= 1st}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Elizabeth Cady Stanton]] used Grimké's criticism of biblical sources to establish a basis for feminist thought. She published ''[[The Woman's Bible]]'', which proposed a feminist reading of the Old and New Testament. This tendency was enlarged by feminist theory, which denounced the patriarchal Judeo-Christian tradition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Castro, Ginette|title=American Feminism: a contemporary history|publisher=NYU Press|date=1990|isbn=|page=31}}&lt;/ref&gt; In his essay, ''A Judicial Patriarchy: Family Law at the Turn of the Century'', Michael Grossberg coined the phrase ''judicial patriarchy'' stating that, "The judge became the buffer between the family and the state." and that, "Judicial patriarchs dominated family law because within these institutional and intraclass rivalries judges succeeded in protecting their power over the law governing the hearth.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Gossberg | first = Michael | chapter = A judicial patriarchy: family law at the turn of the century | chapterurl = https://books.google.com/books?id=bCHkkM1dRYgC&amp;pg=PA289 | editor-last = Grossberg | editor-first = Michael | title = Governing the hearth: law and the family in nineteenth-century America | pages = 289&amp;ndash;307 | publisher = The University of North Carolina Press | location = Chapel Hill London | date = 1985 | isbn = 9780807863367 }}

In China's [[Qing dynasty|Qing Dynasty]], laws governing morality, sexuality, and gender-relations continued to be based on Confucian teachings. Men and women were both subject to strict laws regarding sexual behavior, however men were punished infrequently in comparison to women. Additionally, women's punishment often carried strong social stigma, "rendering [women] unmarriageable," a stigma which did not follow men.&lt;ref&gt;Ruskola, Teemu. “Law, Sexual Morality, and Gender Equality in Qing and Communist China.” ''The Yale Law Journal'', vol. 103, no. 8, 1994, pp. 2531–2565.

In the modern era, the concept of Patriarchy is asserted to manifest itself in [[Institutionalisation|institutionalized]] control, rather than simply being about an individual's sexism.

==Feminist theory==
Feminist theorists have written extensively about patriarchy either as a primary cause of women's oppression, or as part of an interactive system. [[Shulamith Firestone]], a radical-libertarian feminist, defines patriarchy as a system of oppression of women. Firestone believes that patriarchy is caused by the biological inequalities between women and men, e.g. that women bear children, while men do not. Firestone writes that patriarchal ideologies support the oppression of women and gives as an example the joy of giving birth, which she labels a patriarchal myth. For Firestone, women must gain control over reproduction in order to be free from oppression.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Feminist historian [[Gerda Lerner]] believes that male control over women's sexuality and reproductive functions is a fundamental cause and result of patriarchy.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; [[Alison Jaggar]] also understands patriarchy as the primary cause of women's oppression. The system of patriarchy accomplishes this by alienating women from their bodies.

Interactive systems theorists [[Iris Marion Young]] and [[Heidi Hartmann]] believe that patriarchy and capitalism interact together to oppress women. Young, Hartmann, and other [[Socialist feminism|socialist]] and [[Marxist feminism|Marxist feminists]] use the terms ''patriarchal capitalism'' or ''capitalist patriarchy'' to describe the interactive relationship of capitalism and patriarchy in producing and reproducing the oppression of women.&lt;ref name="Tong"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Feminist thought : a more comprehensive introduction|last=Rosemarie|first=Tong|publisher=|others=Botts, Tina Fernandes|date=2017-07-18|isbn=9780813350707|edition= Fifth |location=New York|pages=|oclc=979993556}}&lt;/ref&gt;  According to Hartmann, the term ''patriarchy'' redirects the focus of oppression from the labour division to a moral and political responsibility liable directly to men as a gender. In its being both systematic and universal, therefore, the concept of patriarchy represents an adaptation of the Marxist concept of class and class struggle.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Hartmann |first1=Heidi |title=The Unhappy Marriage of Marxism and Feminism |journal=Capital and Class |volume=8 |page=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

[[Audre Lorde]], an African American feminist writer and theorist, believed that [[racism]] and patriarchy were intertwined systems of oppression.&lt;ref name="Tong" /&gt; [[Sara Ruddick]], a philosopher who wrote about "good mothers" in the context of maternal ethics, describes the dilemma facing contemporary mothers who must train their children within a patriarchal system. Does a "good mother," she asks, train her son to be competitive, individualistic, and comfortable within the hierarchies of patriarchy, knowing that he may likely be economically successful but a mean person? Or does a good mother resist patriarchal ideologies and socialize her son to be cooperative and communal but economically unsuccessful?&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

[[Gerda Lerner]], in her 1986 ''The Creation of Patriarchy'', makes a series of arguments about the origins and reproduction of patriarchy as a system of oppression of women, and concludes that patriarchy is socially constructed and seen as natural and invisible.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

Some feminist theorists believe that patriarchy is an unjust social system that is harmful to both men and women.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=David A. J. Richards|title=Resisting Injustice and the Feminist Ethics of Care in the Age of Obama: "Suddenly ...

Because patriarchy is a social construction, it can be overcome by revealing and critically analyzing its manifestations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Tickner, Ann J.|chapter=Patriarchy|title=Routledge Encyclopedia of International Political Economy: Entries P-Z|publisher=Taylor &amp; Francis|date=2001|isbn=978-0-415-24352-0|pages=1197–1198|chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=lSmU3aXWIAYC&amp;pg=PA1197}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Jaggar, Young, and Hartmann are among the feminist theorists who argue that the system of patriarchy should be completely overturned, especially the [[Heteropatriarchy|heteropatriarchal]] family, which they see as a necessary component of female oppression. The family not only serves as a representative of the greater civilization by pushing its own affiliates to change and obey, but performs as a component in the rule of the patriarchal state that rules its inhabitants with the head of the family.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.unesco.org|title=Violence against Women and Media: Advancements and Challenges of a Research and Political Agenda|last=Montiel|first=Aimée Vega|date=8 October 2014|publisher=UNESCO }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many feminists (especially scholars and activists) have called for culture repositioning as a method for deconstructing patriarchy. Culture repositioning relates to [[culture change]]. It involves the reconstruction of the cultural concept of a society.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Chigbu|first=Uchendu Eugene|title=Repositioning culture for development: women and development in a Nigerian rural community|journal=Community, Work &amp; Family|date=2015|volume=18|issue=3|pages=334–350|doi=10.1080/13668803.2014.981506}}&lt;/ref&gt; Prior to the widespread use of the term ''patriarchy'', early feminists used ''male [[chauvinism]]'' and ''sexism'' to refer roughly to the same phenomenon.&lt;ref name="hooks, bell 2004 17–25"&gt;{{cite book|last=hooks | first = bell|chapter=Understanding patriarchy|chapterurl=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=G28LTQltyVAC&amp;pg=PA17|title=The will to change: men, masculinity, and love|publisher=Washington Square Press|date=2004|pages=17–25|isbn=9780743480338|quote=Patriarchy is a political-social system that insists that males are inherently dominating, superior to everything and everyone deemed weak, especially females, and endowed with the right to dominate and rule over the weak and to maintain that dominance through various forms of psychological terrorism and violence.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Author [[bell hooks]] argues that the new term identifies the ideological system itself (that men claim dominance and superiority to women) that can be believed and acted upon by either men or women, whereas the earlier terms imply only men act as oppressors of women.&lt;ref name="hooks, bell 2004 17–25" /&gt;

Sociologist Joan Acker, analyzing the concept of patriarchy and the role that it has played in the development of feminist thought, says that seeing  patriarchy as a universal, trans-historical and trans-cultural phenomenon where "women were everywhere oppressed by men in more or less the same ways […] tended toward a biological essentialism.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Acker |first1=John |title=The Problem with Patriarchy |journal=Sociology |date=1989 |volume=23 |issue=2 |page=235}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Anne Pollart has described attempts the use of patriarchy as circular and conflating description and explanation. She remarks the discourse on patriarchy creates a ‘theoretical impasse […] imposing a structural label on what it is supposed to explain’ and therefore impoverishes the possibility to explain gender inequalities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Pollart |first1=Anne |title=Gender and Class Revisited, or the Poverty of Patriarchy |journal=Sociology |date=1996 |volume=30 |issue=4 |page=235}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Biological versus social theories==
{{Main|Sex differences in humans|Social construction of gender difference}}

As a common standard of differentiation between sexes, advocates for a patriarchal society like to focus on the influences that hormones have over biological systems.{{Citation needed|date=December 2017}} Hormones have been declared as the "key to the sexual universe" because they are present in all animals and are the driving force in two critical developmental stages: sex-determinism in the fetus, and puberty in the teenage individual.&lt;ref name=Lewontin&gt;{{cite book | chapter = The determined patriarchy | chapterurl = https://athens.indymedia.org/media/upload/2016/09/06/Steven_Rose_Richard_Lewontin_Leon_J._Kamin-Not_In_Our_Genes__Biology_Ideology_and_Human_Nature__-Penguin_Books_Ltd_1990.pdf | last1 = Lewontin | first1 = Richard C. | last2 = Rose | first2 = Steven | last3 = Kamin | first3 = Leon J. | author-link1 = Richard Lewontin | title = Not in our genes: biology, ideology, and human nature | pages = 132&amp;ndash;163 | publisher = Pantheon Books | location = New York | date = 1984 | isbn = 9780140226058 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Playing a critical role in the development of the brain and behavior, testosterone and estrogen have been labeled the "male-hormone" and "female-hormone" respectively as a result of the impact they have when masculinizing or feminizing an individual.

Sociologists tend to reject predominantly biological explanations of patriarchy&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;Macionis, John J. (2012). ''Sociology'' (13th ed.). Prentice Hall. {{ISBN|0205181090}}&lt;/ref&gt; and contend that socialization processes are primarily responsible for establishing [[gender roles]].&lt;ref name="Henslin"&gt;{{cite book|title=Essentials of Sociology|first=James M.|last=Henslin|publisher=Taylor &amp; Francis|date=2001|pages=65–67, 240|isbn=9780536941855}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to standard sociological theory, patriarchy is the result of sociological constructions that are passed down from generation to generation.&lt;ref name="Sanderson"&gt;{{cite book|title=The Evolution of Human Sociality|last=Sanderson|first=Stephen K.|date=2001|publisher=Rowman &amp; Littlefield|isbn=9780847695348|location=Lanham, Maryland|page=198}}&lt;/ref&gt; These constructions are most pronounced in societies with traditional cultures and less economic development.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Sociology: A Global Introduction|first1=John J.|last1=Macionis|last2=Plummer |first2 = Ken |publisher=Prentice Hall|location=Harlow|date=2000|page=347|isbn= 9780130407375}}&lt;/ref&gt; Even in modern, developed societies, however, gender messages conveyed by family, mass media, and other institutions largely favor males having a dominant status.&lt;ref name="Henslin"/&gt;

Biologist [[Richard Lewontin]] asserts that patriarchy persists through social and political reasons, rather than purely biological causes. Opponents of [[gender feminism]], such as [[Christina Hoff Sommers]], have argued that patriarchy has its origin in biological factors.&lt;ref name=Hoff_Sommers&gt;{{cite book |author=Sommers, Christina Hoff |authorlink=Christina Hoff Sommers |title=Who Stole Feminism? How Women Have Betrayed Women |date=1995 |publisher=Simon &amp; Schuster |location=New York |isbn=978-0-684-80156-8 |page=320|title-link=Who Stole Feminism? How Women Have Betrayed Women }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Undue weight inline|Independent source preferred|date=September 2018}}

This is called [[biological determinism]], which looks at humanity from a strictly biological point of view. Thus, the evolution of science in a patriarchal society's focus begins with man and woman. The male [[testosterone]] hormone is, for instance, known to greatly enhance risk taking behaviour; which can generate increased status in groups if successful (balanced with an equal increase in number of failures, with potential losses of status or death as result). The potential magnitude, frequency and longevity of the increased status from a hormonally driven risk-taking success depends on opportunities, which increases rapidly with societal complexity.

A hypothetical patriarchal culture based primarily on a hormonally-driven increased rate of male successes, thus require a certain critical level of societal evolution{{clarify|date=May 2016}} before it could evolve. Other proponents of this theory posit that because of a woman's biology, she is more fit to perform roles such as anonymous child-rearing at home, rather than high-profile decision-making roles, such as leaders in battles. Through this simple basis, "the existence of a sexual division of labor in primitive societies is a starting point as much for purely social accounts of the origins of patriarchy as for biological."&lt;ref name="Lewontin" /&gt;{{rp|157}} Hence, the rise of patriarchy is recognized through this apparent "sexual division".&lt;ref name="Lewontin" /&gt;

Although patriarchy exists within the scientific atmosphere, "the periods over which women would have been at a physiological disadvantage in participation in hunting through being at a late stage of pregnancy or early stage of child-rearing would have been short",&lt;ref name="Lewontin" /&gt;{{rp|157}} during the time of the nomads, patriarchy still grew with power. Lewontin and others argue that such biological determinism unjustly limits women. In his study, he states women behave a certain way not because they are biologically inclined to, but rather because they are judged by "how well they conform to the stereotypical local image of femininity".&lt;ref name="Lewontin" /&gt;{{rp|137}}

Feminists believe that people have gendered biases, which are perpetuated and enforced across generations by those who benefit from them.&lt;ref name="Lewontin" /&gt; For instance, it has historically been claimed that women cannot make rational decisions during their menstrual periods. This claim cloaks the fact that men also have periods of time where they can be aggressive and irrational; furthermore, unrelated effects of aging and similar medical problems are often blamed on menopause, amplifying its reputation.&lt;ref name=Coney&gt;{{cite book | last = Coney | first = Sandra | title = The menopause industry: how the medical establishment exploits women | publisher = Hunter House | location = Alameda, California | date = 1994 | isbn = 9780897931618 }}&lt;/ref&gt; These biological traits and others specific to women, such as their ability to get pregnant, are often used against them as an attribute of weakness.&lt;ref name="Lewontin" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Coney" /&gt;

A growing body of research has found key points of the biological argument to be groundless. For example, it was asserted for over a century that women were not as intellectually competent as men because they have slightly smaller brains on average.&lt;ref name="Gould1980"&gt;{{cite book |last= Gould | first= Stephen |title= The panda's thumb: more reflections in natural history |pages= 152–159 |publisher= Norton |location = New York |date= 1992 |origyear= 1980 |isbn= 978-0393340839 }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, no substantiated significant difference in average intelligence has been found between the sexes. On the other hand, men have a greater variability in intelligence, and except in tests of reading comprehension, in tests of perceptual speed and associative memory, males typically outnumber females substantially among high-scoring individuals.&lt;ref name="Hedges and Nowell"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Hedges | first1 = Larry V. | last2 = Nowell | first2 = Amy | title = Sex differences in mental test scores, variability, and numbers of high-scoring individuals | journal = [[Science (journal)|Science]] | volume = 269 | issue = 5220 | pages = 41&amp;ndash;45 | doi = 10.1126/science.7604277 | pmid = 7604277 | jstor = 2889145 | date = 7 July 1995 | ref = harv }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Furthermore, no discrepancy in intelligence is assumed between men of different heights, even though on average taller men have been found to have slightly larger brains.&lt;ref name="Gould1980"/&gt; Feminists assert that although women may excel in certain areas and men in others, women are just as competent as men.&lt;ref name="Lewontin" /&gt; Therefore, through the growing power of the patriarchal system, a gender bias is created in the work force, leading to a situation in which "men are more likely to be cabinet ministers or parliamentarians, business executives or tycoons, Nobel Prize-winning scientists or fellows of academies, doctors or airline pilots. [As for] [w]omen [they] are more likely to be secretaries, laboratory technicians, office cleaners, nurses, airline stewardesses, primary school teachers, or social workers."&lt;ref name="Lewontin" /&gt;{{rp|132}}

Within the structure of a patriarchal society, patriarchal biases and values are more likely to be promoted in the educational system. Particularly in mathematical and scientific fields, boys are presumed to have more keen spatial abilities than girls, whereas girls are supposed to assume better linguistic skills. These stereotypical manifestations within educational institutions contract with the notions of differently gendered brains and a "relationship between intelligence and brain size".&lt;ref name="Lewontin" /&gt;{{rp|143}} However, there is "no correlation between skull capacity and hence brain weight and 'intellectual power'",&lt;ref name="Lewontin" /&gt;{{rp|143}} yet there is still a constant struggle of gender bias in science.

Sociologist [[Sylvia Walby]] has composed six overlapping structures that define patriarchy and that take different forms in different cultures and different times:
# The state: women are unlikely to have formal power and representation
# The household: women are more likely to do the housework and raise the children
# Violence: women are more prone to being abused
# Paid work: women are likely to be paid less
# Sexuality: women's sexuality is more likely to be treated negatively
# Culture: representation of women in media, and popular culture is "within a patriarchal gaze".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Walby | first = Sylvia | title = Theorizing patriarchy |page=20 | publisher = Wiley-Blackwell | location = Oxford, UK Cambridge, Massachusetts | date = 1990 | isbn = 9780631147688 }}

Some [[sociobiologist]]s, such as [[Steven Goldberg]], argue that social behavior is primarily determined by [[genetics]], and thus that patriarchy arises more as a result of inherent biology than social conditioning. Goldberg also contends that patriarchy is a universal feature of human culture. In 1973, Goldberg wrote, "The ethnographic studies of every society that has ever been observed explicitly state that these feelings were present, there is literally no variation at all."&lt;ref name="Goldberg, Steven"&gt;{{cite book | last = Goldberg | first = Steven | title = The inevitability of patriarchy | publisher = W. Morrow | location = New York | date = 1974 | isbn = 9780688051754 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Goldberg has critics among anthropologists. Concerning Goldberg's claims about the "feelings of both men and women", [[Eleanor Leacock]] countered in 1974 that the data on women's attitudes are "sparse and contradictory", and that the data on male attitudes about male–female relations are "ambiguous". Also, the effects of colonialism on the cultures represented in the studies were not considered.&lt;ref name="Leacock, Eleanor"&gt;{{cite journal | last = Leacock | first = Eleanor | author-link = Eleanor Leacock | title = Reviewed Work: ''The Inevitability of Patriarchy'' by Steven Goldberg | journal = [[American Anthropologist]] | volume = 76 | issue = 2 | pages = 363&amp;ndash;365 | doi = 10.1525/aa.1974.76.2.02a00280 | jstor = 674209 | date = June 1974 | ref = harv }}&lt;/ref&gt;

An early theory in [[evolutionary psychology]] offered an explanation for the origin of patriarchy which starts with the view that females almost always invest more energy into producing offspring than males, and therefore in most [[species]] females are a [[limiting factor]] over which males will compete. This is sometimes referred to as [[Bateman's principle]]. It suggests females place the most important preference on males who control more resources that can help her and her offspring, which in turn causes an [[evolutionary pressure]] on males to be competitive with each other in order to gain resources and power.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Buss | first1 = David Michael | last2 = Schmitt | first2 = David P. | title = Evolutionary psychology and feminism | journal = [[Sex Roles (journal)|Sex Roles]] | volume = 64 | issue = 9&amp;ndash;10 | pages = 768&amp;ndash;787 | doi = 10.1007/s11199-011-9987-3 | date = May 2011 | ref = harv }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The idea that patriarchy is natural has, however, come under attack from many sociologists, explaining that patriarchy evolved due to historical, rather than biological, conditions. In technologically simple societies, men's greater physical strength and women's common experience of pregnancy combined together to sustain patriarchy.&lt;ref name="Lewontin" /&gt; Gradually, technological advances, especially industrial machinery, diminished the primacy of physical strength in everyday life. Similarly, contraception has given women control over their reproductive cycle.{{citation needed|date=December 2014}}

There is considerable variation in the role that gender plays in human societies. The ''[[Encyclopædia Britannica]]'' states, "The consensus among modern anthropologists and sociologists is that while many cultures bestow power preferentially on one sex or the other, matriarchal societies in this original, evolutionary sense have never existed."&lt;ref name=Britannica&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|title=Matriarchy|encyclopedia=[[Encyclopædia Britannica]]|date=2018|accessdate=June 23, 2018|url=https://www.britannica.com/topic/matriarchy}}&lt;/ref&gt; The masculinities scholar [[David Buchbinder]] suggests that [[Roland Barthes]]' description of the term ''[[ex-nomination]]'' (i.e. patriarchy as the 'norm' or common sense) is relevant, "[f]or as long as patriarchy remained tacit as a key principle of experiencing gender difference and hence a dominant discourse in the organization of society, it was difficult to contest its power."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Buchbinder | first = David | author-link = David Buchbinder | chapter = Troubling patriarchy | chapter-url = https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=TmfUzE4WnW8C&amp;pg=PA106 | title = Studying men and masculinities | pages = 106–107 | publisher = Routledge | location = Abingdon, Oxon, UK; New York, N.Y. | year = 2013 | isbn = 9780415578295 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Among the [[Mosuo]] (a tiny society in the Yunnan Province in China), however, women exert greater power, authority, and control over decision-making.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Other societies are [[matrilinear]] or [[matrilocal]], primarily among indigenous tribal groups.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Schlegel|first=Alice|title=Male dominance and female autonomy: domestic authority in matrilineal societies|date=1972|publisher=HRAF Press|location=New Haven, Connecticut|isbn =9780875363288}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some [[hunter-gatherer]] groups have been characterized as largely [[egalitarianism|egalitarian]].&lt;ref name="erdal"&gt;{{cite book | last1 = Erdal | first1 = David | last2 = Whiten | first2 = Andrew | chapter = Egalitarianism and Machiavellian intelligence in human evolution | chapterurl = https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=-okQAQAAIAAJ | editor-last1 = Mellars | editor-first1 = Paul | editor-last2 = Gibson | editor-first2 = Kathleen Rita | title = Modelling the early human mind | publisher = McDonald Institute for Archaeological Research, University of Cambridge | location = Cambridge Oakville, Connecticut | series = Cambridge McDonald Monograph Series | date = 1996 | isbn = 9780951942017 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Some anthropologists, such as Ciccodicola, have argued that patriarchy is a [[cultural universal]].&lt;ref name="Ciccodicola2012"&gt;{{cite book | last = Ciccodicola | first = Floriana | title = Practicing anthropology in development processes: new perspectives for a radical anthropology | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=Gq9QSx4CQLAC&amp;pg=PA160 | page = 160 | publisher = Edizioni Nuova Cultura | location = Roma | date = 2012 | isbn = 9788861347915 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
Barbara Smuts argues that patriarchy evolved in humans through conflict between the reproductive interests of males and the reproductive interests of females. She lists six ways that it emerged:
# a reduction in female allies
# elaboration of male-male alliances
# increased male control over resources
# increased hierarchy formation among men
# female strategies that reinforce male control over females
# the evolution of language and its power to create ideology.&lt;ref&gt;Smuts, Barbara. "The Evolutionary Origins of Patriarchy."  Human Nature, Vol. 6, No. 1, 1995&lt;/ref&gt;

==Psychoanalytic theories==
While the term ''patriarchy'' often refers to male domination generally, another interpretation sees it as literally "rule of the father".&lt;ref name="Mitchell_409"&gt;{{cite book | last = Mitchell | first = Juliet | author-link = Juliet Mitchell | chapter = The cultural revolution | chapter-url = https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=DwG0AAAAIAAJ | title = Psychoanalysis and feminism | page = 409 | publisher = Pantheon Books | location = New York | date = 1974 | isbn = 9780394474724 }}&lt;/ref&gt; So some people{{Who|date=September 2018}} believe patriarchy does not refer simply to of male power over women, but the expression of power dependent on age as well as gender, such as by older men over women, children, and younger men. Some of these younger men may inherit and therefore have a stake in continuing these conventions. Others may rebel.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Eherenreich | first = Barbara | chapter = Life without father | chapterurl = https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=4_zeRtk81pcC | editor-last1 = McDowell | editor-first1 = Linda | editor-last2 = Pringle | editor-first2 = Rosemary | title = Defining women: Social institutions and gender divisions | publisher = Polity/Open University | location = London | date = 1992 | isbn = 9780745609799 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Cockburn | first = Cynthia | title = Brothers: male dominance and technological change | publisher = Pluto | location = London Concord, Massachusetts | date = 1991 | isbn = 9780745305837 }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Explain|date=September 2018}}

This psychoanalytic model is based upon revisions of Freud's description of the normally neurotic family using the analogy of the story of [[Oedipus]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last= Lacan | first = Jaques | author-link = Jaques Lacan | chapter = The mirror stage as formative of the function of the I as revealed in psychoanalytic experience (1949) | chapterurl = https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=XFtrNAEACAAJ |editor-last= Sheridan |editor-first= Alan |title= Écrits: a selection | publisher= Routledge |location= London |date=2001 |origyear= 1977 |isbn= 9780415253925 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Mulvey | first = Laura | author-link = Laura Mulvey | chapter = The Oedipus myth: beyond the riddles of the Sphinx | chapterurl = https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=P6awCwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA177 | title = Visual and other pleasures | pages = 177&amp;ndash;200 | publisher = Palgrave Macmillan | location = Houndmills, Basingstoke, Hampshire England New York | date = 2009 | edition=   2nd | isbn = 9780230576469 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Those who fall outside the Oedipal triad of mother/father/child are less subject to male authority.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Butler | first = Judith | author-link = Judith Butler | title = Antigone's claim: kinship between life and death | publisher = Columbia University Press | location = New York | date = 2000 | isbn = 9780231118958 }}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The operations of power in such cases are usually enacted unconsciously. All are subject, even fathers are bound by its strictures.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite thesis|degree=PhD|last=Dalton|first=Penelope| author-link = Pen Dalton|date=2008| chapter=Complex family relations|title=Family and other relations: a thesis examining the extent to which family relationships shape the relations of art|chapterurl =http://hdl.handle.net/10026.1/758|publisher=[[University of Plymouth]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is represented in unspoken traditions and conventions performed in everyday behaviors, customs, and habits.&lt;ref name="Mitchell_409" /&gt; The triangular relationship of a father, a mother and an inheriting eldest son frequently form the dynamic and emotional narratives of popular culture and are enacted [[Performativity|performatively]] in rituals of courtship and marriage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Dalton | first = Pen | author-link = Pen Dalton| chapter = Theoretical perspectives | chapterurl = https://www.mheducation.co.uk/openup/chapters/0335196489.pdf | title = The gendering of art education: modernism, identity, and critical feminism | pages = 9&amp;ndash;32 | publisher = Open University | location = Buckingham England Philadelphia, Pennsylvania | date = 2001 | isbn = 9780335196494 }}&lt;/ref&gt; They provide conceptual models for organising power relations in spheres that have nothing to do with the family, for example, politics and business.&lt;ref&gt;''Citations'':

Arguing from this standpoint, radical feminist [[Shulamith Firestone]] wrote in her 1970 ''[[The Dialectic of Sex]]'':

&lt;blockquote&gt;Marx was on to something more profound than he knew when he observed that the family contained within itself in embryo all the antagonisms that later develop on a wide scale within the society and the state. For unless revolution uproots the basic social organisation, the biological family – the vinculum through which the psychology of power can always be smuggled – the tapeworm of exploitation will never be annihilated.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Firestone |first=Shulamith | author-link = Shulamith Firestone | title = The dialectic of sex: the case for feminist revolution | url = https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=Zxy2AAAAIAAJ | publisher = Quill | location = New York | date = 1970 | isbn = 9780688123598 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

'''Perizoma''' (from [[Greek language|Greek]] {{lang|grc|περίζωμα}}, from ''peri'' "around, about" and ''zoma'' "loin-cloth, drawers, band, belt") is a type of [[loincloth]] that originated with the [[Minoan civilization]] in [[Crete]]. Surviving depictions show it being worn by male and female acrobats (for example, in the ''[[Bull-Leaping Fresco]]'').&lt;ref name=bonfa/&gt;

A perizoma was possibly worn by [[Jesus]] during his crucifixion. It is a standard feature of the [[crucifixion in the arts]]. However, Roman custom was to crucify victims naked, and there is no evidence to suggest that Jesus was an exception.&lt;ref name=tombs/&gt; Perizoma was likely added by later artists to preserve modesty (see [[fig leaf]]) and first appeared in the 8th century.&lt;ref name=vilad/&gt; [[Aachen Cathedral]] claims to have the actual relic of the perizoma, preserved inside the [[Marienschrein]] reliquary.&lt;ref name=nicke/&gt;

==History==

The step-by-step mechanism of process thinking is a prominent part of cognitive behavioral thinking, which was developed by psychiatrist [[Aaron Beck]].&lt;ref name="Burke" /&gt; In the 1960s, Beck developed [[Cognitive behavioral therapy|a therapy]] which relies on the idea that thoughts affect feelings, and that good mental habits are systematically built up one step at a time.&lt;ref&gt;Layard, Richard and David M. Clark [http://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/richard-layard/mental-health-issues-uk_b_5558239.html Why Do Fewer Than One in Three People With Mental Illness Receive Treatment?] ''Huffington Post UK''.

{{rquote|right|''Don’t think about winning the SEC Championship. Don’t think about the national championship. Think about what you needed to do in this drill, on this play, in this moment. That’s the process: Let’s think about what we can do today, the task at hand.''|Nick Saban&lt;ref name="RH"&gt;{{cite book |last=Holiday |first=Ryan |authorlink=Ryan Holiday |date=2015 |title=The Obstacle Is The Way}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Nick Saban formulated process thinking as it pertains to [[American football]] with the help of [[psychiatry]] [[professor]] Lionel Rosen while Saban was the head coach at [[Michigan State University]].&lt;ref name="GQ" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Observer"&gt;Holiday, Ryan [http://observer.com/2015/12/heres-the-strategy-elite-athletes-follow-to-perform-at-the-highest-level/ Here’s the Strategy Elite Athletes Follow to Perform at the Highest Level] ''New York Observer''. January 5, 2016&lt;/ref&gt; Saban and Rosen broke down complicated tasks like football games—and entire seasons—down into smaller, more manageable pieces. Rosen emphasized that the average football play lasts only seven seconds so coaches and players should concentrate only on those seconds, take a rest between plays, then do it all over again.&lt;ref name="Burke" /&gt;

During his time with [[Louisiana State University|LSU]], the [[Miami Dolphins]], and later the [[University of Alabama]], Saban refined this systematic approach and extended it to include all aspects of managing a football program, which he calls "the process."&lt;ref&gt;Burke, Monte [https://www.forbes.com/sites/monteburke/2015/08/04/9-leadership-lessons-from-nick-saban/2/ 9 Leadership Lessons From Nick Saban] ''Forbes''. January 5, 2016&lt;/ref&gt; A key element of Saban's process, often stylized "The Process", is clearly defined expectations for his players not only on the field, but also academically and personally (including a dress code), which are monitored year-round.&lt;ref name="GQ" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;O'Keefe, Brian [http://fortune.com/2012/09/07/leadership-lessons-from-alabama-football-coach-nick-saban/ Leadership lessons from Alabama football coach Nick Saban] ''Fortune''.

'''Radical translation''' is a thought experiment in ''[[Word and Object]]'', a major philosophical work from American philosopher [[Willard Van Orman Quine]]. It is used as an introduction to his theory of the [[indeterminacy of translation]], and specifically to prove the point of [[inscrutability of reference]]. Using this concept of radical translation, Quine paints a setting where a linguist discovers a native linguistic community whose linguistic system is completely unrelated to any language familiar to the linguist. Quine then describes the steps taken by the linguist in his attempt to fully translate this unfamiliar language based on the only data he has; the events happening around him combined with the verbal and non-verbal behaviour of natives.

==Direct translation==
As a first step, the linguist will use direct translation on occasion sentences. Hearing a lot of utterances of the one-word-sentence 'Gavagai' whenever the linguist sees rabbits, he suspects the one-word-sentence 'Rabbit' to be the correct translation and starts a process of questioning and pointing until he is reasonably certain that the native has the verbal disposition to assent to 'Gavagai' if seeing the stimulus, a rabbit. This stimulus is the affirmative stimulus meaning of 'Gavagai', and the linguist can conclude this is a correct translation.

===Collateral information===
The translation of occasion sentences may be complicated through collateral information. A native, with full expertise of his surroundings, may already assent to 'Gavagai' when not even seeing a rabbit, but is sufficiently satisfied to assent when spotting a specific rabbit-fly that only flies around rabbits. The linguist on the other hand has no such expertise, and will wonder why his hypothesis seems off. 
Collateral information can also create a difference of stimulus meaning between members of the same language community. To solve this issue, the linguist will determine intrasubjective stimulus synonymy, enabling him to pair non-observational occasion sentences such as 'Bachelor' and 'Unmarried man'. While they may differ in stimulus meaning between various speakers, they are stimulus synonymous for the entire language community.

===Stimulus analyticity===
It is also possible for the linguist to determine stimulus analytic sentences, to which the native will assent given any (or no) stimulus. Social analytic sentences are sentences that are stimulus analytic for the entire language community.

==Words and grammar==
So far the linguist has taken his first steps in the creation of a translation manual. However, he has no idea if the term 'gavagai' is actually synonymous to the term 'rabbit', as it is just as plausible to translate it as 'one second rabbit stage', 'undetached rabbit part', 'the spatial whole of all rabbits', or 'rabbithood'.
To question these differences, the linguist now has to translate words and logical particles.

Starting off with the easiest task, to translate logical connectives, he formulates questions where he pairs logical connectives with occasion sentences and going through several rounds of writing down the assent or dissent to these questions from the natives to establish a translation. Any further translation of logical particles is however impossible, as translation of categorical statements (for example) relies on the translation of words, which in turn relies on the translation of categorical statements.

===Inscrutability of reference===
{{See also|Inscrutability of reference}}
As it appears impossible to determine a unique correct translation of 'gavagai' caused by the limits of translation, the linguist can take any of the mentioned possibilities and have it correspond to the stimulus meaning through adaption of the logical connectives. This implies there is no matter of fact to which the word refers.
An example is to take the sentence 'Gavagai xyz gavagai', of which the linguist assumes it translates to 'This rabbit is the same as this rabbit', and to which the native assents. Now, when 'gavagai' is taken as 'undetached rabbit part' and 'xyz' as 'is part of the same animal as', the sentence 'This undetached rabbit part is part of the same animal as this undetached rabbit part', to which the native would also assent. Both sentences have the same stimulus meaning and truth condition. It therefore is impossible to derive the (object of) reference of the term 'gavagai' from the verbal disposition of the native.

==Analytical hypotheses==
So far the linguist has been able to
(1)	Translate observational sentences
(2)	Translate truth functions
(3)	Recognize stimulus analytic sentences
(4)	Recognize intrasubjective stimulus synonymous sentences
To go beyond the limits of translation by stimulus meaning, the linguist uses analytical hypotheses, where he hypothetically equates parts of native sentences to parts of sentences in his own language. Using this, he can now form new sentences and can create a complete translation manual by trial and error through the use of these sentences and adaption of his analytical hypotheses where needed.

==Indeterminacy of translation==
{{See also|Indeterminacy of translation}}
The whole of analytical hypotheses cannot be evaluated as true or false, as they are predictions that can only be judged within their own system.  As a result, all translation is fundamentally undetermined (and not just underdetermined).  This indeterminacy is not meaningless, as it is it is possible to construct two separate translation manuals that are equally correct yet incompatible with each other due to having opposing truth values. A good translation is possible, but an objectively right translation of exact terms is impossible.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="11961">The '''Registry of Interpreters for the Deaf, Inc''' (RID) is a [[non-profit organization]], founded in 1964 and incorporated in 1972, that seeks to uphold standards, ethics, and professionalism for [[American Sign Language]] [[Language interpretation|interpreters]]. RID is the only organization in the United States that credentials both d/Deaf and Hearing interpreters to provide services in a wide range of settings, as well as test and certify interpreters for legal work. The RID Board is committed to the "4 R's" which are: Roots, Respect, Relevance and Results. As of 2014 there were over 15,000 members and 58 affiliate chapters.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=RID - 2014 Annual Report |url=http://www.rid.org/2014-annual-report/#mem-svcs|publisher=Registry of Interpreters for the Deaf|accessdate=13 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Since August 2004, RID has been building stronger ties with the [[National Association of the Deaf (United States)|National Association of the Deaf]] (NAD), including a joint Code of Professional Ethics and the merging of their respective certification programs. They jointly developed the National Interpreter Certification test (NIC), which was adopted in 2005.

RID is headquartered in Alexandria, Virginia, with a roughly $3,000,000 annual budget and around 20 employees. The association's operations are led by an executive director (currently vacant) and governed by an eleven-member board of directors. 

== Governance and Operations ==
RID is governed by an eleven-member board of directors elected directly by the voting membership for a two-year term. Voting rights are determined by being a member in good standing of both RID (in the certified or associate category) and a sanctioned affiliate chapter. The board is made up of the following positions: 
* President
* Vice President
* Secretary
* Treasurer
* Member-at-Large
* Deaf Member-at-Large
* Region I Representative
* Region II Representative
* Region III Representative
* Region IV Representative
* Region V Representative
Following the expiration of the president's term, they serve an ex officio non-voting term on the board of directors as Immediate Past President. 

The Executive Board consists of the President, Vice President, Secretary, Treasurer, Member-at-Large, and Deaf Member-at-Large, and is elected on odd years for two-year terms. The regional representative positions are elected on even years for two-year terms. 

To run for election to the Executive Board, members must collect 25 nomination signatures from voting members with at least one from each region of RID. Regional representative candidates must collect 25 nomination signatures from within their region. All positions except the Member-at Large require the candidate to be certified member of RID for four consecutive years prior to candidacy. Member-at-Large requires either associate or certified membership in RID for four consecutive years prior to candidacy. Additionally, regional representative candidates must have resided in their region at least two years prior to candidacy&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B3DKvZMflFLda1BVN2EyX25FdTA/view|title=RID Bylaws|last=|first=|date=|website=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;. If there are more than one candidates, an election is held via on-line balloting. p

The 2007–2018 board of directors are as follows:

RID operations are conducted by a paid staff led by an Executive Director. Since 2014, RID has not had a permanent Executive Director following the departure of Shane Feldman. The board contracted with Anna Witter-Merithew who served as Interim Executive Director until August 2017. Since that time, the board has served as Executive Director through President Melvin Walker while continuing a permanent Executive Director search.

== Code of Professional Conduct ==

As part of their push to improve the ethical behavior of practitioners in the field, RID revised and updated existing guidelines from the Code of Ethics.&lt;ref name=Code&gt;{{cite web|title=NAD-RID Code of Professional Conduct|url=http://www.rid.org/UserFiles/File/NAD_RID_ETHICS.pdf|publisher=Registry of Interpreters for the Deaf|accessdate=4 June 2013|year=2005|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130930211448/http://www.rid.org/UserFiles/File/NAD_RID_ETHICS.pdf|archivedate=30 September 2013|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2005, the Code of Professional Conduct was adopted as the newest set of principles interpreters should adhere to. Certified interpreters have an especially strong duty to follow the principles laid out by RID, for the integrity of the work, the well being of the stakeholders, and to avoid causing harm.

The tenets from the current Code of Professional Conduct are:

# Interpreters adhere to standards of confidential communication.
# Interpreters possess the professional skills and knowledge required for the specific interpreting situation.
# Interpreters conduct themselves in a manner appropriate to the specific interpreting situation.
# Interpreters demonstrate respect for consumers.
# Interpreters demonstrate respect for colleagues, interns, and students of the profession.
# Interpreters maintain ethical business practices.
# Interpreters engage in professional development.

== RID certifications ==

RID has a national certification system with three key components:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=About RID Overview|url=http://rid.org/aboutRID/overview/index.cfm|publisher=Registry of Interpreters for the Deaf|accessdate=4 June 2013|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130601064321/http://rid.org/aboutRID/overview/index.cfm|archivedate=1 June 2013|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

* The National Testing System (NTS)
* The Certification Maintenance Program (CMP) - assures the continual skill development of certified interpreters.
* The Ethical Practices System (EPS) - gives consumers the ability to express concerns or make complaints about the quality of interpreting/transliterating services.

In previous incarnations of the NTS, the following certifications were given to interpreters meeting the testing criteria (All credentials awarded by the Registry of Interpreters for the Deaf will remain valid as long as the holder of said certification(s) maintains their membership and maintenance program.):

Previously offered certificates:

* CSC - Comprehensive Skills Certificate (1972–1988)
* MCSC - Master Comprehensive Skills Certificate (1972–1988)
* RSC - Reverse Skills Certificate - awarded only to Deaf / hard-of-hearing interpreters/transliterators (1972–1988)
* OIC:C - Oral Interpreting Certificate, Comprehensive (1979–1985)
* OIC: S/V - Oral Interpreting Certificate, Spoken to Visible (1979–1985)
* OIC: V/S - Oral Interpreting Certificate, Visible to Spoken (1979–1985)
* IC - Interpretation Certificate (1972–1988)
* TC - Transliteration Certificate (1972–1988)
* IC/TC - Interpretation and Transliteration Certificates (1972–1988)
* SC: L - Specialist Certificate: Legal (first certificate version of this certification was offered 1975–1978)
* SC: PA - Specialist Certificate: Performing Arts (1971–1988)
* OIC: C - Oral Interpreting Certificate (1979–1983)
* CI - Certificate of Interpretation (1988–2005)
* CT - Certificate of Transliteration (1988–2005)
* NIC Advanced and NIC Master (These levels were offered from 2005 to 2011) 

Currently offered certificates:

* CDI - Certified Deaf Interpreter (On moratorium since August, 2015)
* OTC - Oral Transliteration Certificate (On moratorium since August, 2015)
* SC: L - Specialist Certificate: Legal (On moratorium since August, 2015)
* NIC- National Interpreter Certification 

RID granted certified membership to holders of the defunct NAD certification at levels III, IV and V as well as those who pass the Educational Interpreter Performance Assessment (EIPA) at proficiency level 4.0 with a passing score on the EIPA written exam. The certifications for these members are listed as:
* NAD III
* NAD IV
* NAD V
* ED:K12
No new certified member status is being granted for any of these categories. 

As of July 2005, a new certification test, developed with the NAD, was implemented and the CI and CT tests began to be phased out. The new generalist certification for hearing interpreters is the NAD-RID National Interpreter Certification (NIC). In 2015 NAD decided to withdraw its involvement from the NIC resulting its name being removed from the test. 

== CASLI ==
RID formed a [[limited liability company]] called the Center for Assessment of Sign Language Interpretation (CASLI) in 2015 to carry out all testing functions. CASLI is a wholly owned subsidiary, supported operationally by RID headquarters staff and governed by a Managing Board that reports to the RID Board of Directors. As of 2017, the Board of Managers consisted of: 
{| class="wikitable"
|+Board of Managers

|-
|Vice President
|Keith Cagle
|-
|Vice President
|Patrick Boudreault
|-
|Secretary
|Anthony Aramburo
|-
|Treasurer
|Lyle Vold
|}
In 2017, CASLI's operations began direct supervision by Star Grieser, CDI who reports to the RID Deputy Director. 

CASLI's formation began a clearer philosophical and practical split of certification from professional testing. Under this new scheme, CASLI is granted greater autonomy to design, prepare and conduct generalist testing for both Deaf and hearing interpreters. RID retains the function of certifying interpreters based on their testing results and other certification criteria. As such, the EPS and CMP systems remain under RID's direct control.

{{Use dmy dates|date=May 2014}}
{{Mandaeism}}
The '''Sabians''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|s|eɪ|b|i|ən|z}}; {{lang-ar|الصابئة}} ''{{transl|ar|ALA|al-Ṣābiʼah}}'' or {{rtl-lang|ar|الصابئون}} ''{{transl|ar|ALA|al-Ṣābiʼūn}}'') of Middle Eastern tradition were a religious group mentioned three times in the [[Quran]] as a [[People of the Book]], along with the [[Jews]] and the [[Christian]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Bernard Lewis, ''The Jews of Islam'', 1987, page 13.&lt;/ref&gt; In the ''[[hadith]]'', they were described simply as converts to [[Islam]].&lt;ref&gt;E.g. [[Sahih Bukhari]] Book No. 7, Hadith No. 340; Book No. 59, Hadith No. 628; Book No. 89, Hadith No. 299 etc.&lt;/ref&gt; Interest in the identity and history of the group increased over time. Discussions and investigations of the Sabians began to appear in later Islamic literature. The Sabians were identified by early writers with the ancient Jewish Christian group the [[Elcesaites]], and with [[Gnosticism|gnostic]] groups such as the [[Hermeticism|Hermeticists]] and the [[Mandaeism|Mandaeans]]. Today, the [[Mandaeans]] are still widely identified as Sabians.&lt;ref name="Churton2009"&gt;{{cite book|last=Churton|first=Tobias|title=The Invisible History of the Rosicrucians|date=9 September 2009|publisher=Inner Traditions / Bear &amp; Co|language=English|isbn=9781594779312|page=107}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Etymology==
There has been much speculation as to the origins of the religious [[:wikt:endonym#Noun|endonym]] from this practice. The Arabic root {{lang|ar|ص ب ء}} ({{transl|ar|ALA|ṣ-b-ʾ}}), means to grow forth or rise out of. When said of a star it means to rise, which may explain the association with star-worshippers. When relating to a religion it means one who left his former religion and was even a title of [[Muhammad]] for not being part of his tribe's faith.&lt;ref&gt;pg. 1640 of Edward William Lane's Arabic-English Lexicon&lt;/ref&gt; From such a root and in the context of the Qurʼanic passages, it may refer to all people who leave their faiths, finding fault in them, but have yet to come to Islam, related to the [[Hanif]].&lt;ref&gt;Qurʼan 2:62, 5:69, and 22:17&lt;/ref&gt; The word Sabians or ''{{transl|sem|Ṣubba}}'' is also said to be derived from the Aramaic root related to [[baptism]], the neo-Mandaic is ''{{transl|sem|Ṣabi}}.''&lt;ref name="Häberl1"&gt;{{Harvnb|Häberl|2009|p=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Judah Segal]] (1963)&lt;ref&gt;[[Judah Benzion Segal]], ''The Sabian Mysteries. The Planet Cult of Ancient Harran, Vanished Civilizations,'' ed. by E. Bacon, London 1963&lt;/ref&gt; argued that the term ''Sābi'ūn'' derives from [[Shiva]], a primary god of Hinduism.&lt;ref&gt;''The city of the Moon God: Religious Traditions of [[Harran]]'', p112 Tamara M. Green, 1992. "Segal was inclined to believe that the root of the word Sabian was Syriac. Rejecting the notion that it means baptizer ... Even if the etymology proposed by Segal is correct, nevertheless the question of how Muhammad learned about these ..."&lt;/ref&gt;

==In the Qur'an==
The Qur'an briefly mentions the Sabians in three places, with [[hadith]] providing additional details as to who they were:

{{quote|Indeed, the believers, Jews, Christians, and Sabians—whoever ˹truly˺ believes in God and the Last Day and does good will have their reward with their Lord. And there will be no fear for them, nor will they grieve.{{Cite quran|2|62}}}}

{{quote|Indeed, the believers, Jews, Sabians and Christians—whoever ˹truly˺ believes in God and the Last Day and does good, there will be no fear for them, nor will they grieve.{{Cite quran|5|69}}}}

==In later Islamic sources==
The Muslim scholar [[Al-Khalil ibn Ahmad al-Farahidi]] (d. 786–787 CE), who was in Basra before his death, wrote: "The Sabians believe they belong to the prophet [[Noah]], they read [[Zabur]], and their religion looks like Christianity." He also states that "they worship the angels".{{citation needed|date=June 2016}} According to the Qur'an, the ''[[Zabur]]'', the second book of Abrahamic tradition, was given to [[David in Islam|King David]] of [[History of ancient Israel and Judah|ancient Israel]]. Many modern scholars identify the ''Zabur'' as the [[Psalms]]. 

Most of what is known of the Sabians comes from [[ibn Wahshiyya]]'s ''The Nabatean Agriculture'', translated in 904 CE from Syriac sources. The text discusses beliefs attributed to the Sabians, in particular that they were people who lived in [[Pre-Adamite]] times, that [[Adam]] had parents and that he came from [[History of India|India]].

Other classical Arabic sources include the ''Fihrist'' of [[ibn al-Nadim]] (c. 987), who mentions the ''Mogtasilah'' ("Mughtasila", or "self-ablutionists"), a sect of Sabians in southern Mesopotamia who counted El-Hasaih or al-Hasih (possibly Arabic for "[[Elcesaites|Elchasai]]") as their founder.&lt;ref&gt;[[Daniel Chwolson]], ''Die Ssabier und der Ssabismus'' (Sabians and Sabianism), 1856, I, 112; II, 543, cited by Salmon.{{who|date=June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

[[Al-Biruni]] (writing at the beginning of the eleventh century CE) said that the '"real Sabians'" were "the remnants of the Jewish tribes who remained in [[Babylonia]] when the other tribes left it for [[Jerusalem]] in the days of [[Cyrus the Great|Cyrus]] and [[Artaxerxes I of Persia|Artaxerxes]]. According to [[E. S. Drower]] (1937) these remaining tribes ... adopted a system mixed up of Magism and [[Judaism]].'&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.farvardyn.com/mandaean.php Extracts from Ethel Stefana Drower, 1937, ''Mandaeans of Iraq and Iran'']&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Abu Yusuf Absha al-Qadi, Caliph [[al-Ma'mun]] of [[Baghdad]] in 830 CE stood with his army at the gates of [[Harran]] and questioned the Harranians about what protected religion they belonged to. As they were neither Muslim, Christian, Jewish or Magian, the caliph told them they were non-believers. He said they would have to become Muslims, or adherents of one of the other religions recognized by the Qur'an by the time he returned from his [[Arab–Byzantine wars|campaign against the Byzantines]] or he would kill them.&lt;ref&gt;(Churton p. 26)&lt;/ref&gt; The Harranians consulted with a lawyer, who suggested that they find their answer in the Qur'an II.59, which said that Sabians were tolerated. It was unknown what the sacred text intended by "Sabian" and so they took the name.&lt;ref&gt;[[Tobias Churton]] pp. 26–7&lt;/ref&gt;

These newly dubbed Harranian Sabians acknowledged [[Hermes Trismegistus]] as their prophet and the ''[[Hermetica]]'' as their sacred text, being a group of [[Hermeticism|Hermeticists]]. Validation of Hermes as a prophet comes from his identification as [[Idris (prophet)|Idris]] (i.e. [[Enoch (ancestor of Noah)|Enoch]]) in the Qur'an (19.57 and 21.85).&lt;ref name="Churton p. 27"&gt;(Churton p. 27)&lt;/ref&gt;

However, this account of the Harranian Sabians does not fit with the existence of earlier records making reference to Sabians in Harran. Usamah ibn Ayd, writing before 770 CE (his year of death), already referred to a city of Sabians in the region where Harran lies.&lt;ref&gt;Green, Tamara M. The City of the Moon God. Published by E.J. Brill. 1992. p. 106&lt;/ref&gt;  The jurist Abu Hanifa, who died in 767 CE, is recorded to have discussed the legal status of Harranian Sabians with two of his disciples.&lt;ref&gt;Green p. 112&lt;/ref&gt;

The Harranian Sabians played a vital role in Baghdad and in the rest of the Arab world from 856 until about 1050; serving as the main source of [[ancient Greek philosophy]] and science as well as shaping intellectual life. The most prominent of the Harranian Sabians was [[Thābit ibn Qurra]].&lt;ref name="Churton p. 27"/&gt;

==Non-Islamic sources==

===Maimonides===
The Jewish scholar [[Maimonides]] (1125–1204) translated the book ''The Nabataean Agriculture'', which he considered an accurate record of the beliefs of the Sabians, who believed in idolatrous practices "and other superstitions mentioned in the Nabatean Agriculture." &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sacred-texts.com/jud/gfp/gfp173.htm ''The Guide for the Perplexed,'' Book Three, Chapter 37 p. 334] M. Friedlander. Dover Publications, Inc. New York. 1956.&lt;/ref&gt; He provided considerable detail about the Sabians in his ''[[The Guide for the Perplexed|Guide for the Perplexed]]'' (completed 1186–1190).

===Hippolytus of Rome===
[[Hippolytus of Rome]] describes how Elchasai, founder of the Elcesaites, preached in Parthia to the "Sobiai". Academics{{which|date=June 2016}} agree that this is probably a reference to the Sabians. According to [[Daniel Chwolson]] (1856), they appear to have gravitated around the original pro-Jewish ''Hanputa'' or [[Elcesaites]], from which the prophet [[Mani (prophet)|Mani]] seceded. They are later identified as the pro-Torah ''Sampsaeans''.{{citation needed|date=July 2015}}

==Modern identification==

===In Bahá'í writings===
The Sabians are also mentioned in the literature of the [[Bahá'í Faith]]. These references are generally brief, describing two groups of Sabians: those "who worship idols in the name of the stars, who believed their religion derived from [[Seth]] and [[Idris (prophet)|Idris]]", and others "who believed in the son of Zechariah ([[John the Baptist]]) and didn't accept the advent of the son of Mary (Jesus Christ)".&lt;ref group="note"&gt;Á'ín-i Sábi'ín by Rúhu'lláh Mihrábkháni, Institute for Bahá'í Studies, Ontario, Canada, 1994&lt;/ref&gt; [['Abdu'l-Bahá]] briefly describes Seth as one of the "sons of Adam".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author='Abdu'l-Bahá |authorlink='Abdu'l-Bahá |origyear=1912 |year=1982 |title=The Promulgation of Universal Peace |edition=Hardcover |publisher=Bahá'í Publishing Trust |location=Wilmette, Illinois, USA |isbn=0-87743-172-8 |url=http://reference.bahai.org/en/t/ab/PUP/pup-111.html#pg365 |pages=365}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Bahá'u'lláh]] in a [[Tablet (religious)|Tablet]] identifies Idris with [[Hermes]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author=Bahá'u'lláh | origyear=1873–92 | year=1994 | title=Tablets of Bahá'u'lláh Revealed After the Kitáb-i-Aqdas | publisher=Bahá'í Publishing Trust | location=Wilmette, Illinois, USA |isbn=0-87743-174-4 | url=http://reference.bahai.org/en/t/b/TB/tb-10.html#pg152 | pages=152}}&lt;/ref&gt; He does not, however, specifically name Idris as the prophet of the Sabians.

===Nicolas Siouffi===
The  [[Syriac Christianity|Syrian Christian]],&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=zJ73YfrZ2T4C&amp;pg=PA12&amp;lpg=PA12&amp;dq=Nicolas+Siouffi+christian&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=mPuzf0GSjA&amp;sig=Nlvn7dMvjlsv_e3epFdKk628rB0&amp;hl=it&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwio1cWq3qrKAhWKfRoKHYhcDfQQ6AEIIDAA#v=onepage&amp;q=Nicolas%20Siouffi%20christian&amp;f=false The Mandaeans: The Last Gnostics]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=TJUrBgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA126&amp;lpg=PA126&amp;dq=Nicolas+Siouffi+christian&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=E6jQ6DppHS&amp;sig=aF6DdzNa9-epZ1sZ0KGvU8Egh0s&amp;hl=it&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwio1cWq3qrKAhWKfRoKHYhcDfQQ6AEIJTAB#v=onepage&amp;q=Nicolas%20Siouffi%20christian&amp;f=false Survival Among The Kurds]&lt;/ref&gt; and later French Vice-Consul at [[Mosul]], [[Nicolas Siouffi]] in his ''Études sur la religion des Soubbas ou Sabéens, leurs dogmes, leurs moeurs'' (Paris: Imprimerie Nationale, 1880) claimed to have identified 4,000 Sabians in the [[Soubbha]]s. Siouffi's work was well received by the Theosophist [[G. R. S. Mead]],&lt;ref&gt;[[G. R. S. Mead]], ''Gnostic John the Baptizer: Selections from the Mandaean John-Book,'' p137 "... the French Vice-Consul at Mosul, estimated them at some 4000 souls in all (''Etudes sur la Religion des Soubbas ou Sabéens,'' Paris, 1880). These were then to be found chiefly in the neighbourhood of Baṣra aud Kút. Siouffi's estimate, "&lt;/ref&gt; but scholars criticized the estimates and study.&lt;ref&gt;''The Edinburgh Review,'' 1880, Sydney Smith. "Admitting M. Siouffi's ignorance and his teacher's possible dishonesty, these are scarcely sufficient to account for the origin of all the traditions and beliefs described in the * Etudes sur la religion ' des Soubbas. ..."&lt;/ref&gt;

===21st century scholars===
21st century scholars have possibly identified the Sabians as [[Mandaean]]s or [[Harranian]]s. Jaakko Hämeen-Anttila (2002, 2006) notes that in the [[Mesopotamian Marshes|marsh areas of Southern Iraq]], there was a continuous tradition of Mandaean religion, and that another pagan, or "Sabian", centre in the tenth-century Islamic world centred on [[Harran]].&lt;ref&gt;Jaakko Hämeen-Anttila in ''Ideologies as intercultural phenomena'' p90, ed. Antonio Panaino, Giovanni Pettinato, International Association for Intercultural Studies of the [[MELAMMU]] Project, 2002 "... that in the marsh areas of Southern Iraq there was a continuous tradition of Mandaean religion, but it seems to have been totally neglected in scholarship that there was another pagan, or Sabian, centre in the tenth-century Islamic world, in the countryside of Iraq (sawad) around Baghdad"&lt;/ref&gt; These pagan "Sabians" are mentioned in the [[Nabataean corpus]] of [[Ibn Wahshiyya]].&lt;ref&gt;Jaakko Hämeen-Anttila, 2002. First, the books of the Nabatean corpus themselves claim to be translations from "ancient Syriac" (e.g. Filaha 1:5) made by Ibn Wahshiyya and transmitted to a student of his, Ibn az-Zayyat. The real authors of, e.g., Filaha, according to...&lt;/ref&gt;

A group of modern-day people based in [[Iraq]] call themselves Sabians and follow the teachings of [[John the Baptist]]. They are Mandaeans (or ''Sabian Mandaeans''). They are more urban than other Mandaeans living in southern Iraq, which perhaps explains why they prefer to be called Sabians.&lt;ref name=USATodaySabians/&gt; Due to their faith, pacifism and lack of tribal ties, they have been vulnerable to violence since the [[2003 invasion of Iraq]], and numbered fewer than 5,000 in 2007. They primarily live around [[Baghdad]], where the last sheik resides who conducts services and baptisms. Many from the sect have moved from Baghdad to [[Iraqi Kurdistan|Kurdistan]] where it is safer.&lt;ref name=USATodaySabians&gt;[http://usatoday30.usatoday.com/news/world/iraq/2007-09-27-iraqweek_N.htm?csp=34 "Sabian sect keeps the faith"], ''USA Today,'' 27 September 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6078">Sexual opportunism is the selfish pursuit of sexual opportunities for their own sake when they arise, often with the negative moral connotation that in some way it "takes advantage" of others, or "makes use" of, or "exploits", other persons for sexual purposes. Sexual opportunism is sometimes also defined as the use of sexual favours for selfish purposes ''quite unrelated'' to the sexual activity, in which case taking a sexual opportunity is merely the ''means'' to achieve a quite different purpose, for example to advance one's [[career]] or obtain [[social status|status]] or [[money]].&lt;ref&gt;Graham Scambler, "Sex Work Stigma: Opportunist Migrants in London".  ''Sociology'',  vol. 41, no. 6, December 2007, pp. 1079-1096.&lt;/ref&gt; This may be accepted or tolerated, or it may be criticized because the concerns of others are not adequately taken into consideration (or because it is contrary to authentic sexual love).

To the extent that the feelings, wishes, intentions, purposes, interests or norms of others are not adequately considered in the pursuit of sexual gratification, it then conflicts with some or other principle for appropriate behaviour, and it may involve deceit or dishonesty (for example, the deliberate exploitation of sexual [[innocence]]). In that case, the sexual opportunist is considered to lack sexual and/or personal integrity. In a clinical or scientific sense, sexual opportunism is often straightforwardly described as observable sexual [[promiscuity]] or the observable propensity to engage in [[casual sex]],  whatever the motive.

In that case, the sexual opportunist is considered to lack sexual and/or personal integrity.

Sexual opportunism has always been a much disputed concept, because: 
*moral [[norm (sociology)|norms]] for the legitimate pursuit of sexual desire are often not agreed upon, or influenced by different religious, cultural or spiritual beliefs.  The range of sexual behaviours tolerated or not tolerated can vary greatly across time and place. In some cultures, for example, there are very strong social sanctions against "sex purely for the sake of sex", in other cultures this is regarded more as a private or personal matter, unless it involves unlawful activity. Inversely, the use of sex for a purpose or function unrelated to the sexual activity itself may be tolerated in one context or place, and proscribed in another (see also [[prostitution]] and [[sex tourism]]).
*because a discrepancy between motives considered appropriate, and purely selfish or self-serving motives, may be very difficult to establish, even for the people involved, particularly if an allegedly "opportunist" sexual advance is validated by its acceptance by a potential sexual partner, who responds positively to the opportunity out of personal free will. Thus the exact boundary between "seizing a sexual opportunity" and "sexual opportunism" may in practice be difficult to distinguish. Often sexual [[seduction]] involves precisely the "disguise" of sexual motive, and an attempt to persuade a potential sexual partner that more, or other (honourable) motives are involved than ''just sex'', which may or may not be true—without this being easily verifiable—even for the persons involved themselves. The complicating factor is that the motivations or intentions involved in a sexual attraction may not be clear even to those who are party to it.

In a clinical or scientific sense, sexual opportunism is often straightforwardly described as observable sexual [[promiscuity]] or the observable propensity to engage in [[casual sex]],  whatever the motive. Such an "objective" description is used, because:
* it may not clear or provable that such behaviour conflicts with relevant principles (unless it demonstrably involves unlawful behaviour).
*what matters for medical, juridical or scientific purposes is primarily that it occurs, irrespective of what the motives are, or how those motives are morally judged by the people involved or by others.
*because the judgment that the motives involved are "selfish" or signify "irresponsibility" depends on one's point of view and cannot, or not easily, be objectively or scientifically established.

Promiscuous behaviour or the pursuit of casual sex can occur in varying degrees, or be circumstantial, but can also be motivated by some kind of [[sexual addiction]] or [[hypersexuality]] in which the opportunist actively "preys" on people who are most likely to satisfy his sexual desires, or are easily available for sexual activity ("an easy lay"). The practice is normally considered [[pathological]] only if it significantly harms the sexual opportunist himself, and/or significantly harms his (potential) sexual partners – in a physical or psychological sense – or if it involves unlawful activity (see also [[Harvey Weinstein sexual abuse allegations]]). The definition of "harm" involved may however be contested, insofar as it is not obvious and open to interpretation.

'''Software studies''' is an emerging [[interdisciplinary]] research field, which studies [[software systems]] and their social and cultural effects.

==Overview==
The implementation and use of software has been studied in recent fields such as [[cyberculture]], [[Internet studies]], [[new media studies]], and [[digital culture]], yet prior to software studies, software was rarely ever addressed as a distinct object of study.

Software studies is an interdisciplinary field. To study software as an artifact, it draws upon methods and theory from the [[digital humanities]] and from computational perspectives on software. Methodologically, software studies usually differs from the approaches of [[computer science]] and [[software engineering]], which concern themselves primarily with software in information theory and in practical application; however, these fields all share an emphasis on computer literacy, particularly in the areas of programming and source code. This emphasis on analyzing software sources and processes (rather than interfaces) often distinguishes software studies from new media studies, which is usually restricted to discussions of interfaces and observable effects.

==History==
The conceptual origins of software studies include [[Marshall McLuhan]]'s focus on the role of media in themselves, rather than the content of media platforms, in shaping culture. Early references to the study of software as a cultural practice appear in [[Friedrich Kittler]]'s essay, "Es gibt keine Software,"&lt;ref name="Kittler, 1993"&gt;{{Cite book| publisher = Reclam| pages = 225–242| last = Kittler| first = Friedrich| title = Draculas Vermächtnis: Technische Schriften| chapter = Es gibt keine Software| location = Leipzig| year = 1993}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web| last = Kittler| first = Friedrich| title = There is no software| work = CTheory.net| accessdate = 2013-01-19| date = 1995| url = http://www.ctheory.net/articles.aspx?id=74}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Lev Manovich]]'s ''Language of New Media'',&lt;ref name="Manovich, 2001"&gt;{{Cite book| publisher = MIT Press| isbn = 0-262-13374-1 | pages = xxxix, 354| last = Manovich| first = Lev| title = The language of new media| year = 2001}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Matthew Fuller's ''Behind the Blip: Essays on the culture of software''.&lt;ref name="Fuller, 2003"&gt;{{Cite book| publisher = Autonomedia| isbn = 1-57027-139-9 | page = 165| last = Fuller| first = Matthew| title = Behind the Blip: Essays on the culture of software| year = 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt; Much of the impetus for the development of software studies has come from videogame studies, particularly platform studies, the study of videogames and other software artifacts in their hardware and software contexts. New media art, software art, motion graphics, and [[computer-aided design]] are also significant software-based cultural practices, as is the creation of new protocols and platforms.

The first conference events in the emerging field were Software Studies Workshop 2006 and SoftWhere 2008.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20100327185154/http://pzwart.wdka.hro.nl/mdr/Seminars2/softstudworkshop Software Studies Workshop] Rotterdam 2006 conference website&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://workshop.softwarestudies.com/ SoftWhere: Software Studies Workshop] San Diego 2008 conference website&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2008, [[MIT Press]] launched a ''Software Studies'' book series&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|last=Fuller |first=Matthew |author2=Lev Manovich |author3=Noah Wardrip-Fruin |title=Software Studies - Series |work=MIT Press |accessdate=2013-01-18 |date=2010 |url=http://mitpress.mit.edu/catalog/browse/browse.asp?btype=6&amp;serid=179 |deadurl=unfit |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100803154024/http://mitpress.mit.edu/catalog/browse/browse.asp?btype=6&amp;serid=179 |archivedate=August 3, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; with an edited volume of essays (Matthew Fuller's "Software Studies: a Lexicon"),&lt;ref name="Fuller, 2008"&gt;{{cite book | last = Fuller | first = Matthew | title = Software Studies: a lexicon | year = 2008 | publisher = The MIT Press | url = http://mitpress.mit.edu/catalog/item/default.asp?ttype=2&amp;tid=11476 | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20100717061342/http://mitpress.mit.edu/catalog/item/default.asp?ttype=2&amp;tid=11476 | archivedate = 2010-07-17 | isbn = 0-262-06274-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the first academic program was launched, ([[Lev Manovich]], [[Benjamin H. Bratton]] and [[Noah Wardrip-Fruin]]'s "Software Studies Initiative" at U.

In 2011, a number of mainly British researchers established ''Computational Culture'', an open-access peer-reviewed journal. The journal provides a platform for "inter-disciplinary enquiry into the nature of the culture of computational objects, practices, processes and structures."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gold.ac.uk/cultural-studies/calendar/?id=4870|title=Computational Culture: Double Book Launch and Launch of Computational Culture, a journal of software studies|work=Goldsmiths|date=December 2011|accessdate=January 18, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Related fields==
Software studies is closely related to a number of other emerging fields in the [[digital humanities]] that explore functional components of technology from a social and cultural perspective.  Software studies' focus is at the level of the entire program, specifically the relationship between interface and code.  Notably related are [[critical code studies]], which is more closely attuned to the code rather than the program,&lt;ref&gt;http://criticalcodestudies.com/wordpress&lt;/ref&gt; and platform studies, which investigates the relationships between hardware and software.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | last = Bogost | first = Ian |author2=Nick Montfort  | title = Platform Studies, a book series published by MIT Press | work = Platform Studies | accessdate = 2013-01-18 | url = http://platformstudies.com/ }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal| last = Kirschenbaum| first = Matthew| title = Where Computer Science and Cultural Studies Collide [paywalled]| journal = The Chronicle of Higher Education| accessdate = 2013-01-18| date = 2009-01-23| url = http://chronicle.com/article/Where-Computer-Science-and/14806}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Structural violence''' is a term commonly ascribed to [[Johan Galtung]], which he introduced in the article "Violence, Peace, and Peace Research" (1969).&lt;ref&gt;Galtung, Johan. "Violence, Peace, and Peace Research" ''[[Journal of Peace Research]]'', Vol. 6, No. 3 (1969), pp. 167–191&lt;/ref&gt; It refers to a form of violence wherein some [[social structure]] or [[social institution]] may harm people by preventing them from meeting their basic needs. Institutionalized [[Adultism#Institutional adultism|adultism]], [[ageism]], [[classism]], [[elitism]], [[ethnocentrism]], [[nationalism]], [[speciesism]], [[racism]], and [[sexism]] are some examples of structural violence as proposed by Galtung.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.galtung-institut.de/en/home/johan-galtung/ Johan Galtung]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.iais.org.my/e/index.php/events-sp-1744003054/past-events/517-public-lecture-seeking-peace-from-resolving-conflict-between-buddhists-and-muslims-in-myanmar-and-sri-lanka-by-prof-dr-johan-galtung.html "Seeking Peace from Resolving Conflict between Buddhists and Muslims in Myanmar and Sri Lanka" by Prof. Dr. Johan Galtung]&lt;/ref&gt; According to Galtung, rather than conveying a physical image, structural violence is an "avoidable impairment of fundamental human needs".&lt;ref&gt;Johan Galtung, "Kulturelle Gewalt" (1993) Vol. 43 ''Der Burger im Staat'' p. 106 in Ho, Kathleen "Structural Violence as a Human Rights Violation" (2007). ''Essex Human Rights Review'' Vol. 4 No. 2 September 2007&lt;/ref&gt; As it is avoidable, structural violence is a high cause of premature death and unnecessary disability. Because structural violence affects people differently in various social structures, it is very closely linked to social injustice.&lt;ref name=PLoS/&gt; Structural violence and direct violence are said to be highly interdependent, including [[domestic violence|family violence]], [[sexual violence|gender violence]], [[hate crime]]s, [[racial violence]], [[police violence]], [[state violence]], [[terrorism]], and [[war]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first1 = James |last1 = Gilligan |authorlink = James Gilligan |year = 1997 |title = Violence: Reflections on a National Epidemic |location =  |publisher = [[Vintage Books]] |isbn = 978-0679779124 |quote = Structural violence is ... the main cause of behavioral violence on a socially and epidemiologically significant scale (from homicide and suicide to war and genocide). The question as to which of the two forms of violence—structural or behavioral—is more important, dangerous, or lethal is moot, for they are inextricably related to each other, as cause to effect. |page = 196 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In his book ''Violence: Reflections on a National Epidemic'', [[James Gilligan]] defines structural violence as "the increased rates of death and disability suffered by those who occupy the bottom rungs of society, as contrasted with the relatively lower death rates experienced by those who are above them". Gilligan largely describes these "excess deaths" as "non-natural" and attributes them to the stress, shame, [[discrimination]], and denigration that results from lower status. He draws on Sennett and Cobb, who examine the "contest for dignity" in a context of dramatic [[social inequality|inequality]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Gilligan|first1=James|title=Violence: Reflections on a National Epidemic|date=1996|publisher=First Vintage Books|location=New York|isbn=0-679-77912-4|edition=second}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Bandy X Lee wrote in her article ''Causes and cures VII: Structural violence,'' "It refers to the avoidable limitations society places on groups of people that constrain them from achieving the quality of life that would have otherwise been possible. These limitations could be political, economic, religious, cultural, or legal in nature and usually originate in institutions that have authority over particular subjects."&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Aggression and Violent Behavior|last=|first=|publisher=|year=2016|isbn=|location=|pages=109–114|quote=|via=ScienceDirect}}&lt;/ref&gt; She goes on to say that it "directly illustrates a power system wherein social structures or institutions cause harm to people in a way that results in maldevelopment or deprivation".&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Rather than the term being called social injustice or oppression, there is an advocacy for it to be called violence because this phenomenon comes from, and can be corrected by human decisions, rather than just natural causes.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== Cause and effects ==
In ''The Sources of Social Power'',&amp;nbsp;Michael Mann makes the argument that within state formation, "increased organizational power is a trade-off, whereby the individual obtains more security and food in exchange for his or her freedom."&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|title=How Old is Human Brutality?: On the Structural Origins of Violence|journal=Common Knowledge|volume=22|issue=1|last=Malešević|first=Siniša|publisher=Duke University Press|year=2016|isbn=|location=|pages=81–104|quote=|via=Academic Search Premier}}&lt;/ref&gt;&amp;nbsp;Siniša&amp;nbsp;Malešević&amp;nbsp;elaborates on Mann's argument by saying, "Mann's point needs extending to cover all social organizations, not just the state. The early chiefdoms were not states, obviously; still, they were established on a similar basis—an inversely proportional relationship between security and resources, on the one hand, and liberty, on the other."&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; This means that although those who live in organized, centralized social systems are not likely subject to hunger or to die in an animal attack, they are likely to engage in organized violence, which could include war. These structures make for opportunities and advances that humans could not create for themselves, including the development of agriculture, technology, philosophy, science, and art; however, these structures take tolls elsewhere, meaning that these structures are both productive and detrimental. In our early history, hunter-gather groups used organizational power to acquire more resources and produce more food, but at the same time, this power was also used to dominate, kill, and enslave other groups in order to expand territory and supplies.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

Although structural violence is said to be invisible, it has a number of influences which shape it. These include identifiable institutions, relationships, force fields, and ideologies, including discriminatory laws, gender inequality, and racism.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Chopra|first=Anayika|year=2014|title=Structural Violence|url=|journal=International Journal of Multidisciplinary Approach &amp; Studies|volume=1| issue =  4|pages=19–23|via=Academic Search Premier}}&lt;/ref&gt; Moreover, this does not only exist for those of the lower class, although the effects are much heavier on them, including the highest rate of disease and death, unemployment, homelessness, lack of education, powerlessness, and shared fate of miseries. The whole social order is effected by social power, but these other groups have much more indirect effects on them, with the acts generally being less violent.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

Due to the social and economic structure in place today, specifically the division into rich and poor, powerful and weak, and superior and inferior, the death rate is between 10 and 20 million per year, which is about ten times the death rates from suicide, homicide, and warfare combined.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

==Cultural violence==
"Cultural violence" refers to aspects of a culture that can be used to justify or legitimize direct or structural violence, and may be exemplified by religion and ideology, language and art, empirical science and formal science.&lt;ref&gt;Galtung, Johan. "Cultural Violence," ''Journal of Peace Research'', Vol. 27, No. 3 (Aug., 1990), pp. 291–305&lt;/ref&gt;

Cultural violence makes direct and structural violence look or feel "right", or at least not wrong, according to Galtung.&lt;ref&gt;Galtung 1990, p. 291&lt;/ref&gt; The study of cultural violence highlights the ways the act of direct violence and the fact of structural violence are legitimized and thus made acceptable in society. One mechanism of cultural violence is to change the "moral color" of an act from "red/wrong" to "green/right", or at least to "yellow/acceptable".&lt;ref&gt;Galtung 1990, p. 292&lt;/ref&gt;

==International scope==
{{see also|Structural violence in Haiti}}
[[Petra Kelly]] wrote in her first book, ''Fighting for Hope'' (1984):

{{quote|A third of the 2 Billion people in the [[developing countries]] are [[starving]] or suffering from [[malnutrition]]. Twenty-five percent of their children die before their fifth birthday […] Less than 10 per cent of the 15 million children who died this year had been [[vaccinated]] against the six most common and dangerous [[Childhood disease|children's diseases]]. Vaccination costs £3 per child. But not doing so costs us five million lives a year. These are classic examples of ''structural violence''.}}

The violence in structural violence is attributed to the specific organizations of society that injure or harm individuals or masses of individuals. In explaining his point of view on how structural violence affects the health of subaltern or marginalized people, [[medical anthropologist]] [[Paul Farmer]] writes:

{{quote|Their sickness is a result of structural violence: neither culture nor pure individual will is at fault; rather, historically given (and often economically driven) processes and forces conspire to constrain individual agency. Structural violence is visited upon all those whose social status denies them access to the fruits of scientific and social progress.}}

This perspective has been continually discussed by [[Paul Farmer]], as well as by [[Philippe Bourgois]] and [[Nancy Scheper-Hughes]].

Theorists argue that structural violence is embedded in the current world system; this form of violence, which is centered on apparently inequitable social arrangements, is not inevitable. Ending the global problem of structural violence will require actions that may seem unfeasible in the short term. To some,{{who|date=June 2015}} this indicates that it may be easier to devote resources to minimizing the harmful impacts of structural violence. Others, such as futurist Wendell Bell, see a need for long-term vision to guide projects for social justice. Many structural violences, such as [[racism]] and [[sexism]], have become such a common occurrence in society that they appear almost invisible. Despite this fact, sexism and racism have been the focus of intense cultural and political resistance for many decades. Significant reform has been accomplished, though the project remains incomplete.{{citation needed|date=June 2015}}

Paul Farmer notes that there are three reasons why structural violence is hard to see. 

1. Suffering is exoticized--that is, when something/someone is distant or far away, individuals tend to not be affected by it. When suffering lacks proximity, it's easy to exoticise. 
2. The weight of suffering is also impossible to comprehend. There is simply no way that many individuals are able to comprehend what suffering is like. 
3. Lastly, the dynamics and distribution of suffering are still poorly understood. &lt;ref&gt;Women, Poverty &amp; AIDS: Sex, Drugs and Structural Violence (Series in Health and Social Justice), with coauthor Margaret Connors, Common Courage Press; Reprint edition (September 1996), {{ISBN|978-1-56751-074-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Access to health care===
Structural violence affects the availability of [[health care]] in the sense that physicians often need to pay attention to broad social forces (racism, gender inequality, classism, etc.) to determine who falls ill and who will be given access to care. It is more likely for structural violence to occur in areas where biosocial methods are neglected in a country's health care system. Since structurally violent situations are viewed primarily as biological consequences, it neglects environmentally stimulated problems, such as negative social behaviours or inequality prominence. If biosocial understandings are forsaken when considering [[discrimination against people with HIV/AIDS|communicable diseases such as HIV]], for example, prevention methods and treatment practices become inadequate and unsustainable for populations. However, the challenge is obvious: many countries cannot afford to stop the harmful cycle of structural violence.&lt;ref name="PLoS"&gt;{{cite journal |last = Farmer |first = Paul E. |authorlink = Paul Farmer |author2 = Nizeye Bruce |author3 = Stulac Sara |author4 = Keshavjee Salmaan |date = October 24, 2006 |title = Structural Violence and Clinical Medicine |journal = [[PLoS Medicine]] |volume = 3 |issue = 10 |pages = 1686–1691 |doi = 10.1371/journal.pmed.0030449 |url = http://www.plosmedicine.org/article/info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pmed.0030449 |pmid = 17076568 |pmc = 1621099 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Paul Farmer argues that the major flaw in the dominant model of medical care is that medical services are sold as a [[commodity]], remaining only available to those who can afford them.&lt;ref name=PLoS/&gt; The concept of structural violence is used to show how medical professionals are not trained to understand the social forces behind disease, nor are they trained to deal with or alter them. Medical professionals have to ignore the social determinants that alter access to care, and as a result, medical interventions are significantly less effective in low-income countries.&lt;ref name=PLoS/&gt; Structural violence is an issue not only in developing countries, but also in North America. For example, it has had a significant impact on diagnosis and treatment of AIDS in the United States. A 1990 study by Moore et al. found that blacks had a significantly lesser chance of receiving treatment than whites.&lt;ref name=PLoS/&gt;  Findings from another study suggest that the increased rate of workplace injury among undocumented Latino immigrants in the United States can be understood as an example of structural violence.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Flynn|first=Michael A.|last2=Eggerth|first2=Donald E.|last3=Jacobson|first3=C. Jeffrey|date=2015-09-01|title=Undocumented status as a social determinant of occupational safety and health: The workers’ perspective|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/281671993_Undocumented_status_as_a_social_determinant_of_occupational_safety_and_health_The_workers%2527_perspective|journal=American Journal of Industrial Medicine|volume=58|issue=11|pages=1127–1137|doi=10.1002/ajim.22531|issn=1097-0274|pmc=4632487|pmid=26471878}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Structural violence is the result of policy and [[social structure]]s, and change can only be a product of altering the processes that encourage structural violence in the first place. Paul Farmer claims that "structural interventions" are one possible solution.

Countries such as Haiti and Rwanda have implemented these interventions with positive outcomes. Examples include prohibiting the [[commodification]] of the citizen needs, such as health care, ensuring equitable access to effective therapies, and developing social safety nets. These initiatives increase citizen's [[economic, social and cultural rights|social and economic rights]], thus decreasing structural violence. However, for these structural interventions to be successful, medical professionals need to be capable of executing such tasks. Unfortunately, many of these professionals are not trained to perform structural interventions.&lt;ref name=PLoS/&gt; Moreover, medical professionals continue to operate under conventional clinical intervention because physicians can rightly note that structural interventions are not their job. Therefore, the onus falls more on political and other experts to implement such structural changes. As noted, structural forces account for most if not all epidemic diseases (e.g., HIV). Medical professionals still continue to operate under the downstream phenomenon, with a focus is on individual lifestyle factors rather than general socio-economic, cultural, and environmental conditions. This paradigm obscures the structural impediments to changes because it tends to avoid the root causes that should be focused on. One response is to incorporate medical professionals and to acknowledge that such active structural interventions are necessary to address real public health issues.&lt;ref name=PLoS/&gt;

The lessons that have been learned from successful examples of structural interventions in these countries are fundamental. Although health disparities resulting from social inequalities are possible to reduce, as long as health care is exchanged as a commodity, those without the power to purchase it will have less access to it. Biosocial research should be the main focus. Sociology can better explain the origin and spread of infectious diseases, such as HIV or AIDS. Research shows that the risk of HIV is highly affected by one's behavior and habits.&lt;ref name=PLoS/&gt; Although some structural interventions can decrease premature morbidity and mortality, the social and historical determinants of the structural violence cannot be omitted. Although the interventions have enormous influence on economical and political aspects of international bodies, more interventions are needed to improve access.&lt;ref name=PLoS/&gt;

Structural violence also exists in the area of [[mental health]], where systems are designed to ignore the lived experiences of people with mental illnesses when making decisions about services and funding without consulting with the ill, including those who are illiterate, cannot access computers, do not speak the dominant language, are homeless, are too unwell to fill out long formal surveys, or are in locked psychiatric and forensic wards. Online-only consultation may be inappropriate for people with a lived experience of mental illness. Structural violence is also apparent when consumers in developed countries die from preventable diseases 15–25 years earlier than do people without a lived experience of mental health.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3690">The '''Summer Work Travel Program''' is a program founded and maintained by the [[United States Department of State]], which determines the number of students that have a right to take part each year. The program works with private companies that register students into the program and help to provide information and get the necessary documents, including the [[J-1 visa]]. Some agencies also help program participants to plan their journey to their future place of work, giving the possibility of purchasing international airline tickets on students tariffs.{{clarify|date=May 2017|reason=What does this mean? (copied from Work and Travel USA's 2nd paragraph)}}

==Program details==
{{Prose|section|date=May 2017}}
The Summer Work Travel Program is intended for students who wish to familiarize themselves with the culture of the United States and to work during their summer vacation. Terms of the program, work placement, conditions, and payment are arranged in advance of the trip. Upon completion, students are free to travel throughout the United States.&lt;ref&gt;[http://j1visa.state.gov/programs/summer-work-travel/ Summer Work Travel Program] Retrieved 2011-09-19.&lt;/ref&gt;

State Department conducts the necessary supervision and co-ordination of the program and determines the possible number of program participants annually.

Sponsors are US organizations approved by State Department to manage the Summer Work and Travel Program.

Overseas agencies recruit organizations that work closely with Sponsors to select the right students for the program.

Employer is a US company that offers jobs to the international students.

Participant to Summer Work and Travel Program is an International Student that comes to the United States for cultural exchange, work and travel period of 4 months.

The program uses SEVIS, a United States Government computerized system that collects and manages data about all international students and exchange visitors during their stays. SEVIS tells the U.S. government where students live, work, and their legal status during your program. Generic distribution information of program participants is publicly available on the [[J-1 visa]] website.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://j1visa.state.gov/swt-participants-map/|title=Summer Work Travel Participants Map {{!}}  J-1 Visa|publisher=[[United States Department of State]]|access-date=2017-05-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The program window varies by country to account for local differences in summer vacation duration and dates. Participants in the [[southern hemisphere]] participate during the winter in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://j1visa.state.gov/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/February-1-2016-Program-Date-Chart.pdf|title=Summer Work Travel 2015-2016 Season Program Dates by Country|date=February 19, 2016|publisher=[[United States Department of State]]|accessdate=May 21, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Requirements==
Summer Work and Travel students must be:
* Sufficiently proficient in English to successfully interact in an English speaking environment
* Post-secondary school students enrolled in and actively pursuing a degree or other full-time course of study at an accredited classroom based, post-secondary educational institution outside the United States
* Have successfully completed at least one semester or equivalent of post-secondary academic study
* Pre-placed in a job prior to entry unless from a [[Visa Waiver Program|visa waiver country]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://j1visa.state.gov/programs/summer-work-travel/|title=Summer Work Travel Program|last=State|first=Department of|access-date=2016-08-29}} {{PD-notice}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Taibai Jinxing''' ({{zh|c=太白金星|p=Tài Bái Jīn Xīng|l=Great White Golden Star}}) also referred to as Tai Bai Jin Xing, is a fictional character in the Chinese classical novel ''[[Journey to the West]]''. He was an envoy of the [[Jade Emperor]], the ruler of Heaven. After hearing of the appearance of [[Sun Wukong]], the Jade Emperor tasked Taibai Jinxing to summon him to Heaven. Initially Taibai Jinxing was the first person from Heaven that was to see Sun Wukong. After which Sun Wukong consented to leave with Taibai Jinxing. However, Sun Wukong was angry at the fact that he was appointed as the Protector of the Horses (i.e., made the [[stableboy]] as an insult), and rebelled against Heaven. This led to Taibai Jinxing to once again act as a messenger and somewhat a friend toward Sun Wukong. Taibai Jinxing was not mentioned after the first few chapters of ''Journey to the West''. Taibai Jinxing was also the reason the other members of ''Journey to the West'', such as [[Sha Wujing]] to be alive. In [[Chinese astronomy]], Taibai Jinxing is the name for [[Venus]]. Taibai Jinxing is also associated as the messenger god of [[Shenism]], or the Chinese folk religion.

'''''The Day After Tomorrow''''' (also known as '''''Into Infinity''''' in the United Kingdom) is a 1975 British [[Science fiction on television|science-fiction]] television drama produced by [[Gerry Anderson]] between the first and second series of ''[[Space: 1999]]''. Written by [[Johnny Byrne (writer)|Johnny Byrne]] and directed by [[Charles Crichton]], it stars [[Brian Blessed]], [[Joanna Dunham]] and [[Nick Tate]] and is narrated by [[Ed Bishop]]. ''The Day After Tomorrow'' first aired in December 1975 in the United States on [[NBC]], as an episode of an occasional series of [[after school special]]s for children, ''[[Special Treat]]''. In the UK, it was broadcast on [[BBC1]] as a [[TV special]] in December 1976 and December 1977; 37 years later, in November 2014, a revised version was broadcast on [[BBC Four]]. The plot of ''The Day After Tomorrow'' concerns the interstellar mission of ''Altares'', a science spacecraft of the future that can travel at the [[speed of light]]. From its initial destination of [[Alpha Centauri]], the starship pushes deeper into space; there, her crew of three adults and two children encounter such phenomena as a [[meteor shower]], a [[red giant]] and, finally, a [[black hole]], which pulls the ship into [[another universe]].

Originally commissioned to create a child-friendly introduction to [[Albert Einstein]]'s [[special relativity]] theory in the form of an exciting action-adventure, Anderson and Byrne conceived ''The Day After Tomorrow'' as a [[television pilot]] for a potential series and gave it an alternative episode title of "Into Infinity". Ultimately, Anderson's limited budget prevented additional episodes from being made. With a cast and crew including veterans of earlier Anderson productions, filming on ''The Day After Tomorrow'' ran from July to September 1975; this comprised ten days of [[principal photography]] and six weeks of [[special effects]] shooting. The visuals of ''Space: 1999'' provided inspiration for both [[Martin Bower]], who designed the [[scale model]] effects for the special, and production designer [[Reg Hill]], who re-used set elements created for various episodes of that series to build the interiors of ''Altares''. Newcomer [[Derek Wadsworth]] collaborated with Steve Coe to compose the [[Theme music|theme]] and [[incidental music]].

Critical reception to ''The Day After Tomorrow'' remains mixed. The model effects and music have been praised; however, commentators have been both favourable and unfavourable in their comparisons of the special's "psychedelic" images to the visual style employed by film director [[Stanley Kubrick]]. Although Byrne's scriptwriting has been described as "lyrical", and it has been suggested that ''The Day After Tomorrow'' contains homages to the 1960s TV series ''[[Lost in Space]]'', the plot has been criticised for a lack of suspense, which critics have generally attributed to the fact that the special is primarily a science education programme. Further criticism has been directed at the acting, with [[Martin Lev]]'s performance attracting a particularly negative response. Author [[Douglas R. Mason]]'s [[novelisation]] of the special remains unpublished, but a new novelisation by Gregory L Norris was released by Anderson Entertainment in September 2017.

==Plot==
In the future, the survival of human civilisation is increasingly threatened by rising pollution, environmental damage and the depletion of the Earth's [[natural resource]]s.&lt;ref name="Bentley, p. 315"/&gt; The narrator ([[Ed Bishop]]) introduces Space Station Delta and the "lightship" ''Altares'' – the latter of which is the first Earth spacecraft to "harness the limitless power of the [[photon]]", allowing it to travel at the [[speed of light]]: "This could create the effects predicted by [[Einstein]]'s [[Special relativity|Theory of Relativity]] – effects that could shrink the very fabric of space, distort time, and perhaps alter the structure of the universe as we understand it."

''Altares'' is due to leave Delta on a mission beyond the [[Solar System]] to seek out [[Terrestrial planet|Earth-like planets]] for possible colonisation. Due to the effects of [[time dilation]], by which astronauts travelling at near-light speed age far more slowly than people on Earth, the ship will be crewed by two whole "family units". Arriving in a [[United Nations]] shuttle, Doctors Tom and Anna Bowen ([[Brian Blessed]] and [[Joanna Dunham]]) board ''Altares'' with their son, David ([[Martin Lev]]). Meanwhile, Jane Masters ([[Katharine Levy]]) leaves her dog, Spring, in the care of station commander Jim Forbes ([[Don Fellows]]). Her father, Captain Harry Masters ([[Nick Tate]]), engages ''Altares''&lt;nowiki&gt;'&lt;/nowiki&gt;s "photon drive" and the vessel starts its 4.3-[[light-year]] journey to the star [[Alpha Centauri]],&lt;ref name="Bentley, p. 316"&gt;Bentley, p. 316.&lt;/ref&gt; its first scheduled stop. As ''Altares'' nears the edge of the Solar System, Jane and David observe how [[Pluto]] appears to change colour from blue to red due to the shortening and lengthening of light waves caused by the [[Doppler effect]]. Arriving at Alpha Centauri, the crew launch a series of satellites to relay data back to Earth. Having completed their primary objective, the Masters and Bowen families then agree to push deeper into space.

When ''Altares'' encounters a [[star cluster]], Anna tells Jane of Einstein's accomplishments in the areas of special relativity and [[unified field theory]]. Shortly after, the ship is hit by a [[meteor shower]] that damages various systems and causes the photon drive to re-activate, hurling ''Altares'' through space at such velocity that the travellers are knocked out. A fail-safe brings the vessel, now powerless, to a halt within the gravitational field of a [[red giant]] on the brink of [[supernova]]. Donning a heat suit, Captain Masters risks his life by entering the reactor core in a bid to repair the drive. He succeeds, and Anna and Jane pilot the ship outside the blast radius of the star before it explodes.

Detecting a signal from Delta, which has taken the equivalent of 15 Earth years to reach them, the travellers are able to plot their position and lay in a course home. However, disaster strikes when ''Altares'' is caught in the gravity of a [[black hole]] that has formed from a collapsed star. The photon drive is unable to provide the [[faster-than-light]] speeds necessary to break free; nevertheless, Anna urges the crew not to give up hope, for she suspects that the object may be a gateway to [[another universe]]. Her theory is proven correct when, sustaining the various space-time distortions at the [[event horizon]], ''Altares'' safely emerges from the black hole – intact, albeit with no way of returning to Earth. As the vessel and its intrepid crew approach a planet, the narrator concludes, "One thing is sure – this is not the final word. Not the end, but the beginning. A new universe, a new hope? Only time will tell."

==Production==
In the spring of 1975, after filming on "[[List of Space: 1999 episodes#Year One (1975–1976)|Year One]]" of ''[[Space: 1999]]'' had been completed, [[NBC]] agent George Heinemann contacted [[AP Films#Group Three|Group Three]] producer [[Gerry Anderson]] with an idea for a new science-fiction TV series.&lt;ref name="Archer and Hearn, p. 226"&gt;Archer and Hearn, p. 226.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Archer and Nicholls, p. 174"&gt;Archer and Nicholls, p. 174.&lt;/ref&gt; This would comprise seven one-hour episodes&lt;ref name="Bentley, p. 315"&gt;Bentley, p. 315.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="FandersonGuide"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fanderson.org.uk/epguides/tdateg.html|title=Fanderson Presents a Gerry Anderson Production: ''The Day After Tomorrow'': 'Into Infinity'|year=2004|work=fanderson.org.uk|publisher=[[Fanderson]]|location=[[Bradford]]|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080506213418/http://www.fanderson.org.uk/epguides/tdateg.html|archivedate=6 May 2008|accessdate=14 December 2010|deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt; designed to teach children about scientific subjects in the format of an entertaining action-adventure.&lt;ref name="Archer and Hearn, p. 226"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Archer and Nicholls, p. 174"/&gt; To publicise the series, NBC undertook to distribute information leaflets to schools.&lt;ref name="Archer and Hearn, p. 226"/&gt; Heinemann hired Anderson to produce a [[Television special|TV special]] that would discuss, as its main topic, the physicist [[Albert Einstein]]'s theory of [[special relativity]], which holds that the [[speed of light]] cannot be exceeded and remains constant whether an object is still or in motion.&lt;ref name="Archer and Hearn, p. 226"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Archer and Nicholls, p. 174"/&gt;

===Writing===
By 1975, Group Three Productions had received no assurance from its distributor, [[ITC Entertainment]], that a second series of ''Space: 1999'' would be commissioned.&lt;ref name="Bentley, p. 315"/&gt; With the possibility of cancellation looming, Anderson and his scriptwriter, ''Space: 1999'' script editor [[Johnny Byrne (writer)|Johnny Byrne]], conceived the special that would become ''The Day After Tomorrow'' as the [[pilot episode]] of a prospective new series.&lt;ref name="Bentley, p. 315"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Archer and Hearn, p. 226"/&gt; If successful, the pilot, titled "Into Infinity", would be followed by additional episodes – the series itself to be named ''The Day After Tomorrow''.&lt;ref name="Bentley, p. 315"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Archer and Hearn, p. 226"/&gt; Ultimately, Anderson was unsuccessful in securing the funding needed to make a full series, and ''The Day After Tomorrow'': "Into Infinity" remains a self-contained science-fiction drama.&lt;ref name="Bentley, p. 315"/&gt;

In preparation for his work on the special, Anderson researched Einstein's achievements; in his authorised biography, he admitted that he did not understand any of the physicist's theories.&lt;ref name="Archer and Hearn, p. 226"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Archer and Nicholls, p. 174"/&gt; Byrne's script directed that ''E''=''mc''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; – the Einsteinian formula that [[Mass-energy equivalence|relates mass to energy]] – appear on-screen at intervals. Of the ending, it commented that, "it's a universe not only stranger than we imagine, but stranger than we ''can'' imagine."&lt;ref name="RFTBlogspot"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://reflectionsonfilmandtelevision.blogspot.com/2008/12/cult-movie-review-day-after-tomorrow.html |title=Cult Movie Review: ''The Day After Tomorrow'' (1975) |first=John |last=Kenneth Muir |authorlink=John Kenneth Muir |date=10 December 2008 |work=[[Blogger (service)|reflectionsonfilmandtelevision.blogspot.com]] |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5uydZoWn8?url=http://reflectionsonfilmandtelevision.blogspot.com/2008/12/cult-movie-review-day-after-tomorrow.html |archivedate=14 December 2010 |accessdate=14 December 2010 |deadurl=no |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Although special relativity provides the main scientific and educational focus of the programme, ''The Day After Tomorrow'' also examines [[time dilation]] – an effect whereby time decelerates at a rate proportional to that of the acceleration of an object.&lt;ref name="FandersonGuide"/&gt; For the crew of ''Altares'', a ship capable of travelling at the speed of light, the mission to [[Alpha Centauri]] is measured in years, while whole decades pass on Earth.&lt;ref name="FandersonGuide"/&gt; To encourage children to explore the topics in their own time (and thereby develop their research skills), Byrne wrote the characters in such a way that they provide only partial explanations of special relativity and related subjects.&lt;ref name="FandersonGuide"/&gt;

Most of the cast of ''The Day After Tomorrow'' had appeared in or otherwise contributed to earlier Anderson productions.&lt;ref name="Archer and Hearn, p. 226"/&gt; [[Nick Tate]], who had appeared as the supporting character of [[Alan Carter (Space 1999)|Alan Carter]] in Year One of ''Space: 1999'', played the Captain of ''Altares'', Harry Masters.&lt;ref name="Bentley, p. 316"/&gt; His contract awarded him third place in the credits.&lt;ref name="FandersonGuide"/&gt; [[Brian Blessed]] and [[Joanna Dunham]], starring as the husband-and-wife duo of Doctors Tom and Anna Bowen, and billed above Tate, had both appeared in guest roles – Blessed in the episode "Death's Other Dominion", Dunham in "[[Missing Link (Space: 1999)|Missing Link]]".&lt;ref name="Bentley, p. 316"/&gt;

In the role of Space Station Delta Commander Jim Forbes was [[Don Fellows]], who had played an uncredited voice part in ''Space: 1999''&lt;nowiki&gt;'&lt;/nowiki&gt;s first episode, "[[Breakaway (Space: 1999)|Breakaway]]".&lt;ref name="Bentley, p. 316"/&gt; [[Ed Bishop]] had voiced the character of [[Captain Blue (Captain Scarlet)|Captain Blue]] in Anderson's late-1960s puppet series ''[[Captain Scarlet and the Mysterons]]'' before taking on in the lead role of Commander Ed Straker in the live-action ''[[UFO (TV series)|UFO]]''.&lt;ref name="Bentley, p. 316"/&gt; Neither [[Martin Lev]] nor [[Katherine Levy]] had any previous acting experience, although the filming of ''The Day After Tomorrow'' at Pinewood Studios coincided with that of [[Alan Parker]]'s musical comedy ''[[Bugsy Malone]]'', in which Lev played the role of gangster Dandy Dan.&lt;ref name="Bentley, p. 316"/&gt; Byrne's dog, Bones, appeared as the Masters' pet, Spring.&lt;ref name="Bentley, p. 316"/&gt;

===Filming===
[[File:DayAfterTomorrowAltares.jpg|thumb|200px|alt=The image depicts a futuristic spaceship docked to a structure that represents part of a space station.|Drawing inspiration from designs that had been used in ''[[Space: 1999]]'', special effects technician [[Martin Bower]] constructed a {{Convert|6|ft|m|adj=mid|spell=in}} [[scale model]] of ''Altares'' (depicted here above the model representing Space Station Delta).&lt;ref name="Bentley, p. 315"/&gt; His designs have received critical praise.&lt;ref name="Space1970Blogspot"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Andersonic"/&gt;]]

[[Principal photography]]  was conducted over ten days in July 1975 at [[Pinewood Studios]] in Buckinghamshire on a budget of £105,000.&lt;ref name="Bentley, p. 315"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Archer and Hearn, p. 226"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Archer and Nicholls, p. 174"/&gt; The [[special effects]] sequences required a further six weeks' filming at [[Bray Studios (UK)|Bray Studios]] in Berkshire; production ended in September.&lt;ref name="Bentley, p. 315"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Archer and Nicholls, p. 174"/&gt; During the filming of ''Space: 1999''&lt;nowiki&gt;'&lt;/nowiki&gt;s "[[List of Space: 1999 episodes#Year Two (1976–1977)|Year Two]]", Group Three re-used a number of props from ''The Day After Tomorrow'' as a cost-saving measure.&lt;ref name="Bentley, p. 315"/&gt; The production staff included several Anderson regulars who had contributed to the earlier series – among them effects director [[Brian Johnson (special effects)|Brian Johnson]], editor [[David Lane (director)|David Lane]] and cinematographer Frank Watts.&lt;ref name="Bentley, p. 315"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Archer and Hearn, p. 226"/&gt; [[Charles Crichton]], whose credits included eight episodes of ''Space: 1999'', returned to direct ''The Day After Tomorrow''. As [[Barry Gray]] was busy with other commitments, the task of composing the theme music fell to newcomer [[Derek Wadsworth]], who also collaborated with Steve Coe to produce the [[incidental music]] and would subsequently compose for Year Two of ''Space: 1999''.&lt;ref name="FandersonGuide"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Archer and Nicholls, p. 179.&lt;/ref&gt; Professor John Taylor served as scientific adviser on the production.&lt;ref name="Bentley, p. 316"/&gt;

In the absence of Bob Bell and [[Keith Wilson (production designer)|Keith Wilson]], who were working on ''[[The New Avengers (TV series)|The New Avengers]]'' and ''[[Star Maidens]]'', the role of production designer was taken up by [[Reg Hill]].&lt;ref name="Bentley, p. 315"/&gt; The set designs for the ''Altares'' interiors were the first that Hill had presented to Anderson since the making of the [[Supermarionation]] series ''[[Fireball XL5]]'' in 1961.&lt;ref name="Bentley, p. 315"/&gt; To realise Hill's concepts, the production team adapted parts of the ''[[Ultra Probe]]'' set created for the ''Space: 1999'' episode "[[Dragon's Domain]]", along with various set elements that had appeared in other episodes.&lt;ref name="Space1970Blogspot"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://space1970.blogspot.com/2010/09/day-after-tomorrow-into-infinity-1975.html |title=Revisiting ''The Day After Tomorrow'': 'Into Infinity' (1975) |first=Christopher |last=Mills |date=9 September 2010 |work=space1970.blogspot.com |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5zCJnTEd2?url=http://space1970.blogspot.com/2010/09/day-after-tomorrow-into-infinity-1975.html |archivedate= 4 June 2011 |accessdate=12 June 2011 |deadurl=no |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Working on the mistaken assumption that his commissions were to appear in ''Space: 1999'', uncredited effects technician [[Martin Bower]]&lt;ref name="Bentley, p. 316"/&gt; took inspiration from the appearance of spaceships featured in the earlier series in designing and building [[scale model]]s of the lightship ''Altares''.&lt;ref name="Bentley, p. 315"/&gt; A small, {{Convert|3|ft|m|adj=mid|spell=in}} model appears in [[long shot]]s; a larger, {{Convert|6|ft|m|adj=mid|spell=in}} version, fitted with gas-powered rocket jets to simulate exhaust and a high-powered light to represent the photon drive, was used for close-ups.&lt;ref name="Bentley, p. 315"/&gt; To construct the {{Convert|10|ft|m|adj=mid}} model of Space Station Delta, Bower revamped the ''SS Daria'' prop first seen in "[[Mission of the Darians (Space: 1999)|Mission of the Darians]]".&lt;ref name="Bentley, p. 315"/&gt; The [[United Nations]] shuttle model was {{Convert|2.5|ft|m}} long.&lt;ref name="Bentley, p. 315"/&gt;

==Broadcast==
In the United States, ''The Day After Tomorrow'' aired on 9 December 1975 on NBC as the third episode of ''Special Treat''.&lt;ref name="Bentley, p. 315"/&gt; In the United Kingdom, it was first broadcast on 11 December 1976 on BBC1.&lt;ref name="Bentley, p. 315"/&gt;

Fearing that the use of both the "Day After Tomorrow" and "Into Infinity" titles would confuse British audiences (as ''The Day After Tomorrow'' was to air not as a [[Television pilot|pilot]], but as a [[Television special|special]] on UK television), the [[BBC]] edited the [[opening titles]] to delete the former.&lt;ref name="Bentley, p. 315"/&gt; In any case, the removal of the episode title, "Into Infinity", would have been more difficult; while the series title appears against a simple [[Starfield (astronomy)|starfield]], the episode title is superimposed on a moving model shot of the lift that transfers the Bowen and Masters families from Space Station Delta to ''Altares'' during the programme's opening scenes.&lt;ref name="Bentley, p. 315"/&gt; Consequently, ''The Day After Tomorrow'' was listed in ''[[Radio Times]]'' magazine and other British media exclusively under the title of "Into Infinity".&lt;ref name="Bentley, p. 315"/&gt;

''The Day After Tomorrow'' had its first UK repeat on BBC1 on 6 December 1977.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite magazine|url=http://genome.ch.bbc.co.uk/schedules/bbcone/london/1977-12-06|title=BBC One London – 6 December 1977: Listings|magazine=[[Radio Times]]|issue=2,821|pages=47–9|publisher=[[BBC Magazines]]|location=London|issn=0033-8060|accessdate=10 November 2014|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141017215632/http://genome.ch.bbc.co.uk/schedules/bbcone/london/1977-12-06|archivedate=17 October 2014|deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1997, the BBC deleted the master tape from its [[BBC Archives|archives]] but retained an edited copy for possible future repeats.&lt;ref name="FandersonGuide"/&gt; Clips of ''The Day After Tomorrow'' (as well as the ''Space: 1999'' episode "Black Sun") were featured in "Black Holes", a 1997 edition of the [[Channel 4]] documentary series ''[[Equinox (TV series)|Equinox]]''.&lt;ref name="Bentley, p. 316"/&gt;

==Reception==
{{Quote box|quote=The premise is a good one, offering scope for a potential series, although it lacks the originality of previous [[Gerry Anderson|Anderson]] series and is perhaps too close to ''[[Lost in Space]]'' in that it features a family crew with a malfunctioning spaceship (but without the [[Robot B-9|robot]] and [[Stanley Adams (actor)|talking carrot]]).|source=–&amp;nbsp;Vincent Law&lt;ref name="Andersonic"/&gt;|align=right|salign=right|width=25%}}

Chris Bentley, author of ''The Complete Gerry Anderson: The Authorised Episode Guide'', notes similarities between ''The Day After Tomorrow'' and the ''[[Fireball XL5]]'' episode "Faster Than Light", whose plot concerns the problems encountered by the crew of spacecraft when it accelerates to light speed.&lt;ref name="Bentley, p. 315"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Bentley, p. 316"/&gt; Elizabeth Howell, a science journalist, argues that the programme is remarkable for its depiction of space exploration "in the [[Space colonization|colonisation]] sense, rather than ''[[Star Wars]]'' and its descendants who show space as a spot to be conquered."&lt;ref name="Pars3c"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pars3c.com/2011/02/13/review-the-day-after-tomorrow-into-infinity/ |title=Review: ''The Day After Tomorrow'': 'Into Infinity' |first=Elizabeth |last=Howell |date=13 February 2011 |publisher=pars3c.com |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5zCJki6Vx?url=http://www.pars3c.com/2011/02/13/review-the-day-after-tomorrow-into-infinity/ |archivedate= 4 June 2011 |accessdate=12 June 2011 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; She comments further that the themes are "strangely timeless&amp;nbsp;... the true, unknown part hits you at the very end."&lt;ref name="Pars3c"/&gt; In a review published in ''[[TV Zone]]'' magazine in 2002, Andrew Pixley praised the acting, music and direction in general, writing that the film "oozes with the charm associated with the golden era of [[Gerry Anderson|Anderson]]."&lt;ref name="TVZone"&gt;{{cite magazine|last=Pixley|first=Andrew|date=June 2002|title=''Into Infinity'' and ''Star Laws''|magazine=[[TV Zone]]|issue=152|publisher=[[Visual Imagination]]|location=London|issn=0957-3844|oclc=226121852|accessdate=14 December 2010|url=http://www.fanderson.org.uk/fansales/tdatdvdreview.html|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080517182609/http://www.fanderson.org.uk/fansales/tdatdvdreview.html|archivedate=17 May 2008|deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, criticising other aspects, he argued that "it is the fundamental concept that falls flat. Rather than making physics a palatable piece of [[Escapism|escapist]] hokum, the format is dragged down to the level of a scantily-illustrated physics textbook&amp;nbsp;... something isn't quite right."&lt;ref name="TVZone"/&gt;

Vincent Law, in a review published in the Gerry Anderson-centric fanzine ''Andersonic'', considers ''The Day After Tomorrow'' an "oddity" and an "uncharacteristically lacklustre entry in the Anderson [[Canon (fiction)|canon]]", commenting that the programme "cracks along at a fair old pace, but the educational content does tend to deaden the first half of the story and limits the room for character development."&lt;ref name="Andersonic"&gt;{{cite magazine|last=Law |first=Vincent |date=Spring 2006 |title=''Into Infinity'' |magazine=Andersonic |issue=2 |accessdate=14 December 2010 |url=http://andersonic.co.uk/page5.htm |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080703080146/http://www.andersonic.co.uk/page5.htm |archivedate= 3 July 2008 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Although he credits the production for "getting its science lesson across in a superficial way", he expresses a negative view of the narration, remarking that "at times [[Ed Bishop|Ed]] [Bishop] comes across like a presenter of one of those old schools programmes from the 70s, just imparting a string of dry facts."&lt;ref name="Andersonic"/&gt; He believes that Jane is the only character who develops over the course of the special.&lt;ref name="Andersonic"/&gt; The adults, by contrast, are "pretty much peripheral", while David can be considered a "miniature [[Spock]]" who "lurks around the ship either brandishing his [[slide rule]], threatening to calculate something, or staring out of the porthole (a nice touch!) dribbling about [[pulsar]]s."&lt;ref name="Andersonic"/&gt;

[[File:DayAfterTomorrowEnding.jpg|thumb|left|alt=The image depicts a futuristic spaceship moving past a brightly-coloured planet, with a nebula and stars in the background and the formula E=MC2 superimposed in bold white letters over the planet surface.|The [[special effects]] have received a mixed critical response, and inspired comparisons to film director [[Stanley Kubrick]].&lt;ref name="RFTBlogspot"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Andersonic"/&gt; The appearances of the [[mass-energy equivalence]] equation have been seen as confusing.&lt;ref name="Andersonic"/&gt;]]

Law believes that the general standard of production design and [[special effects]] is lower than that of ''[[Space: 1999]]'', expressing satisfaction with the [[scale model]]s but suggesting that "the slow-motion filming and wobbly mirror effects are more in keeping with ''[[Blake's 7]]''."&lt;ref name="Andersonic"/&gt; He views the "[[Exposition (literary technique)|info dump]]" opening titles as a weak imitation of the ''Space: 1999'' introduction, and the multiple appearances of the [[Mass-energy equivalence|''E''=''mc''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;]] equation as confusing.&lt;ref name="Andersonic"/&gt; Certain props (such as the slide rule) and design elements (such as [[punched card]]s) also come under criticism from Law, who questions whether a futuristic "lightship" would be equipped with such relatively primitive technology.&lt;ref name="Andersonic"/&gt; Although he suggests that the plot device of the accident-prone ''Altares'' reflects the shifting public perception of space exploration in the 1970s ("a time when optimism in the [[NASA|space programme]] was on the wane"), Law regards such design elements as indicative of the manner in which ''The Day After Tomorrow'' "has stood the test of time less well than other series."&lt;ref name="Andersonic"/&gt;

Commenting on his online blog, literary critic [[John Kenneth Muir]] praises [[Johnny Byrne (writer)|Johnny Byrne]]'s "lyrical" scriptwriting, judges [[Brian Johnson (special effects)|Brian Johnson]]'s effects to be "top-notch for the era", and deems Frank Watts' filming "stunning".&lt;ref name="RFTBlogspot"/&gt; For Muir, the message of the special implies a "high-tech, science-minded update of the whole ''[[Lost in Space]]'' format", while the plot effectively mixes elements of the "claustrophobic" and "action-packed" with "[[psychedelia|psychedelic]]" elements such as the descent into the [[black hole]], a subject on which he alludes to the work of [[Stanley Kubrick]]: the sequence is "a Kubrickian wonder, a montage dominated by double images, slow-motion photography and the use of a creepy distortion lens. Pretty powerful stuff for a kids' show."&lt;ref name="RFTBlogspot"/&gt; Law, meanwhile, considers the [[faster-than-light]] shots to be the special's best effects, and compares the black hole sequence unfavourably to the closing act of Kubrick's 1968 film ''[[2001: A Space Odyssey (film)|2001: A Space Odyssey]]'': "Kubrick's Star-Gate it is not."&lt;ref name="Andersonic"/&gt;

Arguing that ''The Day After Tomorrow'' is "kinda like Kubrick's ''2001: A Space Odyssey''&amp;nbsp;... for kids", science-fiction writer and reviewer Christopher Mills expresses disappointment with the effect of the black hole itself, but describes the fall into the anomaly as "very colourful".&lt;ref name="Space1970Blogspot"/&gt; However, in contrast with Muir, he views the sequences set inside ''Altares'' during the descent as "a bit of a hoot", directing particular criticism at the actors' exaggerated gesticulations.&lt;ref name="Space1970Blogspot"/&gt; Commenting that the plot contains "plenty of wonky [[pseudo-science]] and insanely improbable coincidences", Mills also recalls his fascination at "how 'British'&amp;nbsp;... the characters [are], facing each new peril with remarkable calm and '[[stiff upper lip]]' stoicism. By the time they're caught in the clutches of the ominous black hole, they're apparently so resigned to being jerked around by the universe that they just hold hands and calmly await their fate."&lt;ref name="Space1970Blogspot"/&gt;

{{Quote box|quote=Despite the mostly cold and inexpressive characters, lack of dramatic conflict, or really, even much of a narrative, "Into Infinity" is still entertaining. The sets are convincing (if familiar), the design of the ''Altares'' is fantastic, and the passage through the [[black hole]] is appropriately [[psychedelia|psychedelic]].|source=–&amp;nbsp;Christopher Mills&lt;ref name="Space1970Blogspot"/&gt;|align=right|salign=right|width=30%}}

Muir suggests that the feel of ''The Day After Tomorrow'' is "a little more colourful (less [[minimalist]]) in colour and costume than ''Space: 1999''&lt;nowiki&gt;'&lt;/nowiki&gt;s sterling [[List of Space: 1999 episodes#Year One (1975–1976)|Year One]]", with such elements as Wadsworth's "hard-hitting, hard-driving musical score" livening up the proceedings.&lt;ref name="RFTBlogspot"/&gt; The music has also received praise from Law, who notes a "dynamic pace",&lt;ref name="Andersonic"/&gt; as well as Anderson himself.&lt;ref&gt;Archer and Hearn, p. 232.&lt;/ref&gt; Muir summarises the final product as a "Year One-style 'awe and mystery of space' narrative, but one conveyed in the more colourful-looking or -sounding [[List of Space: 1999 episodes#Year Two (1976–1977)|Year Two]] fashion", and a "time capsule of once-state-of-the-art science fiction".&lt;ref name="RFTBlogspot"/&gt; To Law, it is "half-forgotten experiment which is now perhaps only of interest to aficionados", but "an interesting look at what might have been" if Anderson had been able to produce a full series.&lt;ref name="Andersonic"/&gt; Mills interprets it as a "solid little piece of 70s juvenile sci-fi" that is perhaps "not quite as 'scientifically accurate' as it pretends to be, but fun".&lt;ref name="Space1970Blogspot"/&gt;

In 1997, the [[British Board of Film Classification]] (BBFC) awarded ''The Day After Tomorrow'' a [[History of British film certificates|U certificate]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bbfc.co.uk/website/Classified.nsf/0/15DF4C3B5ED7A6A38025660B00305207?OpenDocument|title=''The Day After Tomorrow'': 'Into Infinity' Rated U by the BBFC|date=24 April 1997|work=bbfc.co.uk|publisher=[[British Board of Film Classification]]|location=London|archiveurl=https://archive.is/20130420202043/http://www.bbfc.co.uk/website/Classified.nsf/0/15DF4C3B5ED7A6A38025660B00305207?OpenDocument|archivedate=20 April 2013|accessdate=14 December 2010|deadurl=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Licensed releases of ''The Day After Tomorrow'' are available in a compilation DVD set entitled 'The Lost Worlds of Gerry Anderson' which is available in the UK and Australia/New Zealand.

Science-fiction writer [[Douglas R. Mason]], an author of several ''[[Space: 1999]]'' novels, wrote a [[novelisation]] of [[Johnny Byrne (writer)|Johnny Byrne]]'s script for ''The Day After Tomorrow''.&lt;ref name="Bentley, p. 316"/&gt; Mason's publisher, Futurama Publications, had originally intended to release additional books, since Anderson had conceived ''The Day After Tomorrow'' as the pilot episode for a prospective TV series.&lt;ref name="Bentley, p. 316"/&gt; When Anderson abandoned this idea, Futurama cancelled Mason's novelisation, which currently remains unpublished.&lt;ref name="Bentley, p. 316"/&gt; However a 2017 novelisation of the story by Gregory L Norris was released by Anderson Entertainment in September 2017.

'''''The Manchurian Candidate''''' is a 1962 American [[suspense thriller]] film about the [[Cold War]] and sleeper agents. It was directed and produced by [[John Frankenheimer]]. The screenplay was written by [[George Axelrod]], and was based on the 1959 [[Richard Condon]] novel ''[[The Manchurian Candidate]]''. The film's leading actors are [[Frank Sinatra]], [[Laurence Harvey]] and [[Janet Leigh]], with [[Angela Lansbury]], [[Henry Silva]], and [[James Gregory (actor)|James Gregory]] among the performers cast in the supporting roles.&lt;ref name="SilverWard"&gt;{{cite book|author1-last=Macek|author1-first=Carl|author2-last=McGarry|author2-first=Eileen|editor1-last=Silver|editor1-first=Alain|editor2-last=Ward|editor2-first=Elizabeth|title=Film Noir: An Encyclopedic Reference to the American Style|location=New York City, Woodstock, NY &amp; London|publisher=Overlook Press|year=1996|pages=183–84}}&lt;/ref&gt;  

The plot centers on the [[Korean War]] veteran Raymond Shaw, the progeny of a prominent political family. Shaw was a [[prisoner of war]] during the conflict in Korea and while being held was [[brainwashing|brainwashed]] by his captors. After his discharge back into civilian life, he becomes an unwitting assassin involved in an international [[communist]] conspiracy.  Officials from China and the Soviet Union employ Shaw as a [[sleeper agent]] in an attempt to subvert and take over the United States government.

The film was released in the United States on October 24, 1962, at the height of [[Soviet Union–United States relations#Cold War (1945–91)|U.S.-Soviet hostility]] during the [[Cuban Missile Crisis]]. It was well-received by critics and was nominated for two [[Academy Award]]s: [[Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress|Best Supporting Actress]] (Lansbury) and [[Academy Award for Best Film Editing|Best Editing]]. It was selected in 1994 for preservation in the United States [[National Film Registry]] by the [[Library of Congress]] as being "culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant."

==Plot==
During the [[Korean War]], the [[Soviet Union|Soviets]] capture a U.S. platoon and take it to [[Manchuria]] in [[People's Republic of China|communist China]]. Three days later, all but two of the soldiers return to the U.S. lines and [[Staff Sergeant]] Raymond Shaw ([[Laurence Harvey]]) is credited by the survivors with saving their lives in combat. Upon recommendation of the platoon's commander, [[Captain (OF-2)|Captain]] Bennett Marco ([[Frank Sinatra]]), Shaw is awarded the [[Medal of Honor]]. He returns stateside to a hero's welcome, exploited by his mother, Mrs. Eleanor Iselin ([[Angela Lansbury]]), on behalf of the political career of her husband and Shaw's stepfather, United States Senator John Yerkes Iselin ([[James Gregory (actor)|James Gregory]]). When asked to describe him, Marco and the other soldiers automatically respond, "Raymond Shaw is the kindest, bravest, warmest, most wonderful human being I've ever known in my life.", even though Shaw is a cold, sad, unsympathetic loner.

In the years to follow, Marco, who has since been promoted to [[major]] and assigned to [[Military Intelligence Corps (United States Army)|Army Intelligence]], suffers from a recurring nightmare. In it, a hypnotized Shaw blithely and brutally murders the two missing soldiers before an assembly of military leaders from the communist nations, during a practical demonstration of a revolutionary [[brainwashing]] technique. Marco is compelled to investigate, but with no solid evidence to back his claims fails to receive support from his uplines. However, Marco learns that another soldier from the platoon, Allen Melvin ([[James Edwards (actor)|James Edwards]]), has had the same nightmare. When Melvin and Marco separately identify the identical two men from their dreams as leading figures in communist governments, Army Intelligence agrees to help Marco investigate.

[[File:Sinatra and Harvey in Manchurian Candidate NYWTS.jpg|thumb|upright|left|Shaw (Harvey, left) with Major Marco (Sinatra) after having jumped into a lake in New York City's [[Central Park]] when his programming was accidentally triggered]]

Meanwhile, Eleanor drives the ascension of Iselin, a [[Joseph McCarthy|McCarthy]]-like [[demagogue]] stirring domestic turmoil and climbing the political ladder based on claims that varying numbers of communists work within the [[United States Department of Defense|Department of Defense]]. Shaw, who broke with the couple immediately upon his return to America, is gradually revealed to have had been programmed by Russian and Chinese communists to be a [[sleeper agent]] who will blindly obey orders without any memory of his actions. His heroism was a [[false memory]] implanted in the platoon during their brainwashing in Manchuria. His programming is triggered by seeing the Queen of Diamonds card while playing solitaire after being induced by his handlers.

Several years pass before Shaw finds happiness when he rekindles a youthful romance with Jocelyn Jordan ([[Leslie Parrish]]), the daughter of liberal Senator Thomas Jordan ([[John McGiver]]), one of his stepfather's political rivals. Mrs. Iselin had previously broken up the relationship, but now facilitates the couple's reunion in order to garner Jordan's support for Iselin's bid for [[Vice President of the United States|Vice President]]. Although pleased with the match, Jordan makes it clear that he will block any effort of Iselin's to seek their party's nomination. Jocelyn, wearing a Queen of Diamonds costume at a party for her thrown by the Iselins, inadvertently triggers Shaw's programming and elopes with him. In response to the senator's rebuff, Mrs. Iselin, who is revealed to be Shaw's American handler, triggers him to kill Jordan at his home, shooting Jocelyn as well when she happens upon the scene. Afterwards, Shaw has no knowledge of his actions and is grief-stricken when he learns of the murders.

Eventually discovering the card's role in Shaw's conditioning, Marco uses a [[Trick deck#forcing decks|forced deck]] in an attempt to deprogram him and reveal his next assignment, which appears imminent. Mrs. Iselin primes her son to assassinate their party's presidential nominee at the height of the ongoing [[political convention]] so that Senator Iselin, as the vice-presidential candidate, will become the nominee by default. In the uproar, he will immediately seek emergency powers that when elected will, in Mrs. Iselin's words, "make [[martial law]] seem like anarchy." Mrs. Iselin tells Shaw that while she had requested a programmed assassin for the task, she never knew it would be her own son, who was selected by the communists in order to bind her more closely to their cause. Kissing Shaw on the lips in a hint at the novel's incestuous relationship, she vows that once in power she will exact revenge for her son's selection as assassin.

Shaw enters the convention hall disguised as a priest and takes up a sniper's position high in its farthest reaches. Alarmed by Shaw's failure to call by the appointed time, Marco and his supervisor, Colonel Milt ([[Douglas Henderson (actor)|Douglas Henderson]]), race to the hall to find and stop him. When the moment to shoot comes, Shaw, instead kills his mother and Senator Iselin. When Marco arrives an instant later, Shaw tells him he failed to call to prevent anyone from interfering with his change in plans. Shaw then fatally turns the rifle on himself.

==Production==
For the role of Mrs. Iselin, Sinatra suggested [[Lucille Ball]], but Frankenheimer, who had worked with Lansbury in ''[[All Fall Down (film)|All Fall Down]]'', countered with her,&lt;ref name=FrankenDVD/&gt; insisting Sinatra watch her in that film before a final choice was made. Although Lansbury played Raymond Shaw's mother, played by Laurence Harvey, she was in fact only three years older than Harvey. An early scene in which Shaw, recently decorated with the Medal of Honor, argues with his parents was filmed in Sinatra's own private plane.&lt;ref name=FrankenDVD/&gt;

[[Janet Leigh]] plays Marco's love interest. In a short biography of Leigh broadcast on [[Turner Classic Movies]], actress [[Jamie Lee Curtis]] reveals her mother had been served divorce papers on behalf of her father, actor [[Tony Curtis]], the morning of the scene where she and Sinatra first meet on a train.

In a scene where Marco attempts to deprogram Shaw in a hotel room opposite the convention Sinatra is at times slightly out of focus. It was a first take, and Sinatra failed to be as effective in subsequent retakes, a common factor in his film performances.{{cn|date=March 2018}} In the end, Frankenheimer elected to use the original. Critics subsequently praised him for showing Marco from Shaw's distorted point of view.&lt;ref name = FrankenDVD/&gt;

In the novel Mrs. Iselin had been sexually abused by her father as a child. Before the dramatic climax, she uses her son's brainwashing to have sex with him. Concerned with blowback over even a reference to such a taboo topic as [[incest]] in a mainstream motion picture of the time, the filmmakers instead opted for Mrs. Iselin to simply kiss Shaw on the lips to imply her incestuous attraction to him.&lt;ref name=FrankenDVD&gt;Director John Frankenheimer's audio commentary, available on ''The Manchurian Candidate'' DVD&lt;/ref&gt;

Nearly half of the film's production budget of $2.2 million went on Sinatra's salary for his performance.{{cn|date=March 2018}}

On the [[review aggregator]] website [[Rotten Tomatoes]], ''The Manchurian Candidate'' holds an approval rating of 98% rating based on 54 reviews, with an average rating of 8.7/10. The website's critical consensus states, "A classic blend of satire and political thriller that was uncomfortably prescient in its own time, ''The Manchurian Candidate'' remains distressingly relevant today."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/1013227-manchurian_candidate/ |title= ''The Manchurian Candidate'' (1962) | publisher=[[Fandango Media]] | work=[[Rotten Tomatoes]] | accessdate = March 1, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; On [[Metacritic]], which uses a [[weighted average]], the film has a score of 94 out of 100, based on 14 critics, indicating "universal acclaim".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.metacritic.com/movie/the-manchurian-candidate-1962|title=The Manchurian Candidate Reviews |publisher=[[Metacritic]] ([[CBS Interactive]]) |accessdate=March 18, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Film critic [[Roger Ebert]] listed ''The Manchurian Candidate'' on his "Great Movies" list, declaring that it is "inventive and frisky, takes enormous chances with the audience, and plays not like a 'classic' but as a work as alive and smart as when it was first released".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.rogerebert.com/reviews/great-movie-the-manchurian-candidate-1962 | title=Great Movie: ''The Manchurian Candidate'' | first=Roger | last=Ebert | authorlink=Roger Ebert | date=December 7, 2003 | publisher=rogerebert.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Releases==
According to rumor, Sinatra removed the film from distribution after the [[John F. Kennedy assassination]] on November 22, 1963. Michael Schlesinger, who was responsible for the film's 1988 reissue by [[MGM/UA]], denies the rumor. According to him the film was not removed, but there was lack of public interest in it by 1963.{{r|schlesinger20080127}} 

Sinatra's representatives acquired rights to the film in 1972 after the initial contract with [[United Artists]] expired.{{r|schlesinger20080127}} The film was broadcast on television in April 1974 on ''[[NBC Saturday Night at the Movies]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.ultimate70s.com/seventies_history/19740427/television | title=Prime-time network TV listings for Saturday April 27, 1974 | publisher=Ultimate70s.com | accessdate=April 2, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; After a successful showing at the [[New York Film Festival]] in 1987 increased public interest in the film, the studio reacquired the rights and it became again available for theater and video releases.&lt;ref name="schlesinger20080127"&gt;{{cite news |first=Michael |last=Schlesinger |title=A 'Manchurian' myth |url=http://articles.latimes.com/2008/jan/27/entertainment/ca-pulloutletter27 |publisher=Los Angeles Times |date=2008-01-27 |accessdate=2008-01-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="santopietro2009"&gt;{{cite book |title=Sinatra in Hollywood |publisher=Macmillan |url=http://books.google.com/books?id=0qUJ-JuSPdQC&amp;pg=PA324&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=vDuoUJfYAqrwigLjo4DQDw&amp;ved=0CEIQ6AEwBg#v=onepage&amp;f=false |author=Santopietro, Tom |year=2009 |pages=324–326 |isbn=9781429964746}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==1970s==

* '''1970'''
** Radio Capital, later to become Capital Radio, is formed in early 1970 by David Maule-ffinch with the intent to apply for [[London]]’s [[Independent Local Radio]] general entertainment licence. In late 1970, Maule-ffinch's future father-in-law, Barclay Barclay-White became involved. The Radio Capital team that was finally in place at the time of application to the IBA included [[Richard Attenborough|Sir Richard Attenborough]], [[George Martin|Sir George Martin]], [[Bryan Forbes]], [[Peter Saunders (impresario)|Sir Peter Saunders]], David Maule-Ffinch and Barclay Barclay-White.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://travel.timesonline.co.uk/article/0,,60-2559200,00.html |title=Obituary: Barclay Barclay-White – Dentist who was instrumental in the launch of London's commercial broadcaster Capital Radio|work= Times Online|date= 22 January 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

**Spring – [[Neil Fox (broadcaster)|Neil Fox]] leaves.
** May – Capital Radio Group and GWR Group merge to form [[GCap Media]].
** DAB station Life is relaunched as [[Capital Life]] with a full presenter line-up. This didn’t last long as in the new year the presenters, apart from breakfast, were dropped.
** December – A new policy started of two advertisements in each break to win favour with listeners, though there were more frequent breaks as a result. This policy was changed within a few months.

*'''2006'''

** March – The station is rebranded once again. It is renamed ''Capital 95.8'' and its slogan becomes "The Sound of London”.
** 3 August – All stations in the [[Classic Gold digital network|Classic Gold]] and [[Capital Gold]] networks are replaced by a new network called simply '''Gold''', the result of the merger of the Classic Gold and Capital Gold networks under one owner, GCap Media.
** 10 December – Following further slips down the listening charts which sees it now down to fourth place in London, the tagline of ‘’London’s Hit Music Network’’ returns, Greg Burns replaces Lucio on drivetime with Lucio moving to the evening show, replacing [[Peter Poulton|Bam Bam]] who leaves the station.

The {{nihongo|'''''Touhou Project'''''|東方Project|Tōhō Purojekuto|lit. Eastern Project|lead=yes}}, also known as '''''Toho Project''''' or '''''Project Shrine Maiden''''', is a series of Japanese [[Shoot 'em up#Bullet hell and niche appeal|bullet hell]] shooter video games developed by the single-person [[Team Shanghai Alice]]. Team Shanghai Alice's sole member, ZUN, independently produces the games' graphics, music, and programming.&lt;ref name="r25"&gt;{{cite web|author=Tomohiro, Katada|url=http://r25.yahoo.co.jp/fushigi/wxr_detail/?id=20081003-90005110-r25|trans-title=What is this Touhou Project popular on Nicovideo and 2ch?|title=ニコ動、2ちゃんねるで人気の｢東方Project｣って何だ?|publisher=R25.jp|date=2008-10-03|accessdate=2009-07-10|language=Japanese|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130729011923/http://r25.yahoo.co.jp/fushigi/wxr_detail/?id=20081003-90005110-r25|archivedate=2013-07-29|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Plots in the ''Touhou Project'' games revolve around the strange phenomena occurring in Gensokyo, a fictional realm inhabited by humans and ''[[yōkai]]'', supernatural beings. Prior to the events of the games, Gensokyo was sealed off from the outside world by a magical barrier. The main protagonist of the series, [[Reimu Hakurei]], is a [[miko|shrine maiden]] who manages the border, fighting antagonistic ''yōkai''. The first five games were produced for the Japanese [[NEC PC-9801]] computer series; bullet hell mechanics were introduced in the second game, ''Story of Eastern Wonderland''. ''[[The Embodiment of Scarlet Devil]]'', released in August 2002, marked a shift to the [[Microsoft Windows]] platform, bringing the games to a larger audience. Several sequels followed, including spin-off [[fighting game]]s that diverged from the series' traditional mechanics.

The series was inducted into the [[Guinness World Records]] in October 2010 for being the "most prolific fan-made shooter series".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130424041751/http://www.guinnessworldrecords.com/records-8000/most-prolific-fan-made-shooter-series/|url=http://www.guinnessworldrecords.com/records-8000/most-prolific-fan-made-shooter-series/|title=Most prolific fan-made shooter series|publisher=[[Guinness World Records]]|archivedate=April 24, 2013|accessdate=2011-09-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Guinness World Records Gamer's Edition 2011 |year = 2011 |publisher = Guinness World Records Ltd |isbn = 978-1-4053-6546-8 |page = 49}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ''Touhou Project'' has spawned a [[media franchise]] including commercial fan books, music, [[light novel]]s, [[manga]], and several fanmade [[anime]] in addition to the main series.

===PC-98 predecessor games===
[[File:TH1to5 covers.jpg|250px|thumb|Cover arts of PC-98 ''Touhou'' games&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://www.rebrank.org/products/dpd1/|title=Doujin Game Package Design Vol.01|publisher=RebRank (a dōjin circle in Japan)|year=2013|page=7|language=Japanese}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]
The ''Touhou'' series of games started on the Japanese [[NEC PC-9801|PC-98]] series of computers and its first five entries are native to that platform; standard PC users are only capable of playing them through an emulator. Also, the PC-9801 series of computers was already on the decline when these games were released. Because of this, they are not well known among players. The group that published these games was called Amusement Makers.

;{{Nihongo|''Highly Responsive to Prayers''|東方靈異伝|Tōhō Reiiden|lit. "Strange Spirit Legend of the East"}}
:The 1st game of the ''Touhou'' series, released in November 1996. It is not a vertical top-down shooter like most other games in the series, and is similar to ''[[Arkanoid]]'' instead. Reimu Hakurei, the perpetual protagonist, was introduced in this game. Reimu Hakurei enters through the gateway into another world, intent on locating and punishing the one responsible for destroying her shrine. Players direct a [[yin yang]] orb with amulets to break away blocks and the level is over once all of them are gone. If the player runs out of time on a level, bullets will rain down until the player completes the level or dies. Bosses are defeated by hitting the orb into them until their life is fully depleted.

;{{Nihongo|''Story of Eastern Wonderland''|東方封魔録|Tōhō Fūmaroku|lit. "Recorded Sealing of an Oriental Demon"}}
:The 2nd ''Touhou'' game released in August 1997 at [[Comiket]] 52. This is the first danmaku game of the series, and also marks the first appearance of Marisa Kirisame (here as the second-to-last boss), the second major player character of the series. The resident shrine maiden Reimu Hakurei returns from a training session in the mountains only to find the Hakurei Shrine overrun by a contingent of ghosts and [[yōkai]]. Excited at the opportunity to test her fledgling abilities, she takes the powerful Hakurei Yin-Yang Orbs and takes off on the back of her turtle Genjii to seek out the source of the invasion. The gameplay is generally the same as ''Eastern Wonderland'' throughout the rest of the series.

;{{Nihongo|''Phantasmagoria of Dim. Dream''|東方夢時空|Tōhō Yumejikū|lit. "Oriental Dream Dimensions"}}
:A two-player versus-type shooter similar to ''[[Twinkle Star Sprites]]'', the game is labeled as the 3rd ''Touhou'' game, released in December 1997 in [[Comiket]] 53. Reimu Hakurei discovers that some mysterious ruins have suddenly appeared just outside the Hakurei Shrine. She joins in a violent competition with the other people who want to explore them—it is said that the one who reaches the heart of the ruins first will win a prize.

;{{Nihongo|''Lotus Land Story''|東方幻想郷|Tōhō Gensōkyō|lit. "Eastern Fantasy Land"}}
:The 4th game of the series, released in August 1998 in Comiket 54. This game introduces the focus mode, a staple of the series hereafter, that slows the [[sprite (computer graphics)|sprite]]'s movement to facilitate dodging bullets. Following the events of the previous games, the Eastern Country is once again at peace until yōkai begin to swarm the Hakurei Shrine and a tremendous power surges from beneath a lake high in the mountains. The shrine maiden Reimu Hakurei once again seeks out and eliminates the source of the disturbance - only, on this occasion, she is unwittingly joined by an old rival. According to ZUN, only 200 to 300 copies of the game were sold at the time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://twitter.com/korindo/statuses/8951043502|title=ZUN's tweet regarding Lotus Land Story|publisher=[[Twitter]]|author=ZUN|date=February 11, 2010|accessdate=February 11, 2010|language=Japanese}}&lt;/ref&gt; The game's title used the caption "Gensokyo", but the world's name is not used until ''The Embodiment of Scarlet Devil''.

;{{Nihongo|''Mystic Square''|東方怪綺談|Tōhō Kaikidan|lit. "Eastern Strange and Lovely Tales"}}
:The 5th and final ''Touhou'' game for the PC-98, released in December 1998 in Comiket 55. Mima and Yuka, final bosses of ''The Story of Eastern Wonderland'' and ''Lotus Land Story'' respectively, return as playable characters in this game. As so often is the case in ''Touhou'' games, something is amiss within the Eastern Country. A massive quantity of demons are pouring from a cave high within the mountains. Seeking the source of this invasion, Reimu Hakurei and others must travel through Makai to the one behind the problem.

===Windows games===
After ''Mystic Square'', the ''Touhou Project'' became inactive for four years while its creator ZUN began to develop several music scores for the ''Seihou'' games. He then left the group and made ''Touhou'' games for [[Microsoft Windows|Windows]] under his own group, Team Shanghai Alice. The playability of the Windows games was substantially improved compared to that of the PC-98 counterparts. Most ''[[dōjin]]'' works derived from the ''Touhou'' series are centered on these games.

;{{Nihongo|''[[The Embodiment of Scarlet Devil]]''|東方紅魔郷|Tōhō Kōmakyō|lit. "Eastern Lands of the Scarlet Devil"}}
:The 6th ''Touhou'' game and the first on Windows. It greatly exceeded the PC-98 games graphically, switched from [[FM Synthesis]] to synthesized [[Pulse-code modulation|PCM]] music (with simplified [[MIDI]] as a fall-back), and was the first game to gather a substantial Western fanbase. The story, set in the 118th season,&lt;ref name="文花帖（書籍）"&gt;文花帖（書籍）&lt;/ref&gt; told by conversations between characters during interludes in the action, goes as such: the land of [[#Setting|Gensokyo]] (setting of all the ''Touhou'' games) has been engulfed by a scarlet mist, and its inhabitants no longer see the sun. As the [[miko|shrine maiden]] [[Reimu Hakurei]] or the [[Asian witchcraft#Japan|witch]] [[Marisa Kirisame]], the player attempts to deal with the source of the mist, a mysterious figure called the Scarlet Devil.
[[File:Perfect Cherry Blossom screenshot.jpg|thumb|right|In-game screenshot of ''Perfect Cherry Blossom'']]
;{{Nihongo|''[[Perfect Cherry Blossom]]''|東方妖々夢|Tōhō Yōyōmu|lit. "Bewitching Eastern Dream"}}
:The 7th ''Touhou'' game. It is unusual among the recent releases in that the English and Japanese titles are not similar in meaning; its Japanese title could be rendered as ''Bewitching Dream''. As the month turns to May, winter has lasted far longer than normal in Gensokyo, and the denizens begin to suspect foul play. As Reimu, Marisa, or the new arrival Sakuya Izayoi, the player embarks in the 119th season&lt;ref name="文花帖（書籍）"/&gt; on a search for those who are working to prevent spring's coming. ''Perfect Cherry Blossom'' continues the tradition of the ''Touhou'' games, with the reappearance of former bosses as playable characters.

;{{Nihongo|''[[Immaterial and Missing Power]]''|東方萃夢想|Tōhō Suimusō|lit. "Gathering Dreams in the East"}}
:''Immaterial and Missing Power'' was produced in collaboration with [[Twilight Frontier]], and is the 7.5th ''Touhou'' game in the series. Despite being released after ''Imperishable Night'', it is numbered 7.5 because the events in this game took place before those of ''[[Imperishable Night]]''. ''Immaterial and Missing Power'' is a 2D [[fighting game]] instead of the usual scrolling shooter. Though Team Shanghai Alice was only responsible for the storyline and some of the music, the game was listed as one of the team's official works.

:Initially playable characters in this game include some of the characters from previous Windows games, such as the two protagonists [[Reimu Hakurei]] and [[Marisa Kirisame]], [[Alice Margatroid]], [[Youmu Konpaku]] (both bosses from ''Perfect Cherry Blossom''), [[Sakuya Izayoi]] and [[Patchouli Knowledge]] (both bosses from ''Embodiment of Scarlet Devil''). More characters become playable as the player finishes the story mode with the initially playable characters, and so on. An official patch to the game adds [[Hong Meirin]] (from ''Embodiment of Scarlet Devil'') as a playable character, but she is not available in the story mode.

:Set within the 119th season, it is about the Hyakki Yagyou that happens once every 3 days.&lt;ref name="文花帖（書籍）"/&gt;

;{{Nihongo|''[[Imperishable Night]]'''''|東方永夜抄|Tōhō Eiyashō|lit. "Eternal Night Vignette from the East"}}
:The 8th ''Touhou'' game. It was released at the [[Comiket]] 66 Convention in August 2004. This story's focus is on a rather more insidious evil than past games. Gensokyo's yearly event, the [[Tsukimi|Moonviewing Feast]], is only one dawn away, but someone seems to have replaced the moon with a fake that will not grow full. A team of human and yōkai set out to remedy this before the night is over.

: In this entry, each of the usual playable characters gets a teammate from the non-human side of Gensokyo. [[Reimu Hakurei]] allies with [[Yukari Yakumo]], [[Yōkai]] of the Boundary; [[Marisa Kirisame]] with [[Alice Margatroid]], the Seven-Colored Puppeteer; and Sakuya brings her mistress, [[Remilia Scarlet]]. The new team is half-[[ghost]] [[Youmu Konpaku]] and full-ghost [[Yuyuko Saigyouji]], Stage 5 and Final bosses of ''Perfect Cherry Blossom'' respectively. All the other characters (except Remilia) appeared in ''Perfect Cherry Blossom.''

;{{Nihongo|''[[Phantasmagoria of Flower View]]''|東方花映塚|Tōhō Kaeizuka|lit. "Oriental Flower Viewing Mound"}}
:The 9th ''Touhou'' game. It was released in August 2005 at the summer [[Comiket]] 68 convention. This game is a versus-type shooter like ''Phantasmagoria of Dim. Dream'', and has very different gameplay from the past three entries in the series. Set within the 120th season,&lt;ref name="文花帖（書籍）"/&gt; the story puts the characters in an investigation on why the flowers of Gensokyo are blooming out of season and more than usual, an incident said to occur every 60 years. Initially playable characters include Reimu, Marisa and Sakuya as usual (as well as two other characters from previous games), but the list adds on as the player progresses in the storyline of each of the players.

:The 9.5th game in the series. It was released at the Comiket 69 convention in December 2005. The game is meant to be the game version of the official fanbook, ''Bohemian Archive in Japanese Red''. The player, as [[tengu]] reporter [[Aya Shameimaru]], is tasked with taking pictures of bosses for her newspaper to clear successively more difficult stages. The game is unique in that the player has no standard shot or bombs; rather, the camera is the main method of offense and defense as it clears bullets from the screen. Scoring is based on the contents of each photo, boss location, number of bullets, and Aya's position. Notably, this is one of only three games in which [[Reimu Hakurei]] is not a playable character—in fact, she does not even appear as an enemy.

:''Alternative Facts in Eastern Utopia'' is an official ''Touhou'' book released on March 30, 2017. It is presented as Aya Shameimaru's attempt to create a tabloid magazine in the style of those from the outside world, which she eventually cancelled and left unpublished. The book features in-universe articles, interviews and advertisements similar to the earlier ''Bohemian Archive in Japanese Red'', but in a significantly more chaotic and haphazard format.

==Gameplay==
In the shooting games, the player's bullet power increases on a linear scale as the player collects power-ups dropped by enemies, and eventually maxes out. The player can also collect 'point' icons to earn extra lives; the amount needed grows exponentially as the player's score rises. The player can use 'focus', the shift key by default, which slows down the player's movement, makes the collision box visible, and (generally; some characters are reversed) focuses the player's attack to make it more powerful. The graze counter, missing from ''Mountain of Faith'' and ''Story of Eastern Wonderland'', tracks how many bullets entered the character sprite but avoided the collision box, and rewards the player with a score bonus for living on the edge.

The player can use a weapon called a 'spell card', which is similar to a 'bomb' in most other shooting games. While the player has a limited number, using one makes the user temporarily invulnerable and uses a special magical attack that generally clears the screen. Each character has two cards with different names and patterns. The player can use one during a short period after being hit by a bullet (known as the 'border between life and death') to avoid loss of a life. The amount of time the player has available to use the border is usually around 0.3 seconds. Bosses also have spell cards, but with bosses the term applies to a prolonged pattern of movements and shots that lasts until the player depletes the boss' health by a certain amount or the time runs out, not a one-shot attack.

Each individual game of the main series from ''Perfect Cherry Blossom'' to ''Ten Desires'' has additional items that affect some aspect of gameplay, such as scoring or gaining extra lives/bombs. For example, ''Perfect Cherry Blossom'' has "cherry points", which are used mostly in scoring, but can grant temporary invulnerability (known as 'supernatural border'); ''Imperishable Night'' has "time points", which are essential for advancing to later stages, and also determine if the player gets to challenge a boss's 'final spell' on normal or higher difficulties; ''Mountain of Faith'' has 'faith' points, which boost the score the player receives upon gathering point items and bonuses for clearing spell cards without dying or using a spell card.

Each ''Touhou'' game has four difficulty levels—easy, normal, hard, and lunatic—with each one being harder than the previous one. Regardless of difficulty choice, there are six stages in each game and each one is harder than the previous. The only exceptions to this are ''Story of Eastern Wonderland'', and ''Embodiment of Scarlet Devil'' on easy difficulty, both of which only have five stages.

In addition to the four main difficulties, there is an extra stage which is a long and difficult stage in which players must play through hordes of enemies, and an especially long boss fight (usually with ten spell cards). In order to reach the extra stage, one must beat the game on normal difficulty or higher without the use of a continue. The only games that allow players to reach the extra stage by completing the easy difficulty are ''Story of Eastern Wonderland'', ''Mystic Square'', ''Perfect Cherry Blossom'', ''Imperishable Night'', ''Fairy Wars'', ''Double Dealing Character'', and ''Legacy of Lunatic Kingdom''. In terms of difficulty, the extra stage is around the normal difficulty level or above. In ''Perfect Cherry Blossom'', there is also a phantasm extra stage in which the enemies that were already difficult in the extra stage have become even more challenging. Although the phantasm stage is aimed for the most experienced players, the difficulty is somewhere in between hard and lunatic. The phantasm stage is accessed by beating the extra stage and capturing at least 60 spells with any of the characters and weapon types combined.

==Plot==

===Background===
The plots of the ''Touhou Project'' revolve around the strange [[phenomena]] that occur in the fictional realm of {{Nihongo|'''Gensokyo'''|幻想郷|Gensōkyō|literally ''Fantasy Village'' or ''Fantasy Land''}}, which ZUN designed with a human village in the grounds of some remote mountain recesses in Japan. Originally, it was simply called "a remote separated land of a human village in an eastern country." Long before Touhou Project's story begins, there lived many non-humans like ''[[yōkai]]'' as well as some humans in the area. After a few humans lost their way into Gensokyo, humans became afraid of approaching this area, although others settled here for the sake of yōkai extermination. However, as time went on, humans developed civilization and multiplied in number, and thus the yōkai became distressed about how this would affect the balance between humans and yōkai. Thus, 500 years before ''The Embodiment of Scarlet Devil'' (EoSD), the yōkai sage Yukari Yakumo developed the "boundary of phantasm and substance," which was favored by the yōkai and protected the balance. This was called the "Yōkai Expansion Project" and made Gensokyo a phantasmal world that automatically called out to the weakened yōkai of the outside world. Other things that disappear from the outside world, like extinct animals, lost tools, and architecture, also became abundant in Gensokyo. Since Gensokyo was a plot of land in Japan that was separated by a barrier, it is Japan that is immediately outside of this barrier.

As a result of the seal, Gensokyo became inaccessible from the outside world, and similarly, those in Gensokyo were unable to leave. Gensokyo's existence could not be confirmed from the outside world, nor could the outside world be confirmed within Gensokyo. As a result, the isolated community developed its own civilization, different from that of the outside world. Although separated by a barrier, it is a bordering world to its outside, as opposed to being in a [[Parallel universe (fiction)|parallel universe]]. There are no seas in Gensokyo, since it is an inland mountain. In Gensokyo, there are few humans, and various kinds of yōkai. Some species include magicians, beasts, therianthropies, vampires, [[Yūrei|bōrei]], [[tengu]], mermaids, [[Kappa (folklore)|kappa]], and yōkai (a kind of miscellaneous group). There are others species that could be yōkai depending on definition, like fairies, spirits, [[yūrei]], [[onryō]], poltergeists, hermits, [[Oni (folklore)|oni]], and gods.

In present Gensokyo, which is presented in all ''Touhou Project'' games since EoSD, as opposed to the outside world where unscientific phenomena were dismissed as "superstition" by the time of the [[Meiji period|Meiji era]], magical and spiritual qualities prevail. The only known gateway from the outside world into Gensokyo is the Hakurei Shrine on the border of Gensokyo. The spell card rules were also established to keep up the relationship between humans and yōkai in a mock style, which was necessary for the preservation of the balance of Gensokyo. The "Great Hakurei Barrier," managed by Hakurei [[Miko]], was constructed  several decades before EoSD, which is described as a "barrier of common sense," and is thus a strong logical barrier that not even yōkai can pass through. The yōkai were at first against its construction, but then gradually understood its usefulness.

===In-game events===
In Gensokyo, events called "incidents" occur once in a while. An incident is an event that affects all of Gensokyo and is of unknown cause at the time it occurs.&lt;ref name="g_pp.112-116"&gt;''Perfect Memento in Strict Sense'' pp. 112–116 "Hakurei Reimu."&lt;/ref&gt; ''Touhou Project'' mainly focuses on incidents in its stories, but there are also works like ''[[Mountain of Faith]]'' that are about events other than incidents.

Frequently, incidents are due to a yōkai's whim or curiosity, and usually Reimu Hakurei would go to investigate it and then find and chastise the perpetrator. Usually, the shrine maiden of the Hakurei Shrine resolves incidents, but there are cases where Marisa Kirisame and other imitators would resolve them.&lt;ref name="g_pp.112-116"/&gt; When a major incident occurs, the spirits and fairies are affected by the circumstances, the incident, and the perpetrator, and experience an increase in power for the duration incident, so there are also cases where a mere fairy defeats Reimu.&lt;ref name="sangetsu_sakesanbai"&gt;"Sangetsusei Part 2 Separate volume edition, volume 1, p. 129-143 "番外編 酒三杯にして……"&lt;/ref&gt; It has additionally been stated that people of the village also go out to resolve incidents.&lt;ref&gt;''Perfect Memento in Strict Sense'' p. 136-137 "Human Village"&lt;/ref&gt;

===Characters===
{{main|List of Touhou Project characters}}
With its focus on [[bishōjo]] characters, the ''Touhou'' series possesses a large cast compared to other shooting games. While they aren't developed nearly to the standards of a story-based game, many players love them, and even obscure stage bosses who only appear once have a fanbase. One example is Hong Meiling, affectionately known as Chūgoku (China), the stage 3 boss of ''The Embodiment of Scarlet Devil'', who won a popularity contest in Japan out of all ''Touhou'' characters.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://f39.aaa.livedoor.jp/~nullpopo/toho2/|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050209080524/http://f39.aaa.livedoor.jp/%7Enullpopo/toho2/|dead-url=yes|archive-date=2005-02-09|title=Touhou Saimoe 2 official website and contest results|publisher=[[Livedoor]]|accessdate=2007-01-11|language=Japanese}}&lt;/ref&gt; Among the vast array of characters, only six named characters are male. One (Genjii) is a turtle, one is a cat (Sokrates), two (Youki Konpaku and Myouren Hijiri) are only mentioned in passing, one (Rinnosuke Morichika) is only featured in the serialized novel, and the last (Unzan) is a cloud-like entity. There is also one before all these (Shingyoku), but this character has three forms of different genders, so this character may not exactly be male.

Though each game features a collection of different characters, the main protagonist of the series is always [[List of Touhou Project characters#Reimu Hakurei|Reimu Hakurei]], joined by [[List of Touhou Project characters#Marisa Kirisame|Marisa Kirisame]] after the second game. Exceptions to this include ''Shoot the Bullet'' and ''Double Spoiler'' ([[List of Touhou Project characters#Aya Shameimaru|Aya Shameimaru]] is playable on both, and [[List of Touhou Project characters#Hatate Himekaidou|Hatate Himekaidou]] can become playable in ''Double Spoiler''); ''[[Fairy Wars]]'' (which has [[List of Touhou Project characters#Cirno|Cirno]] as the sole playable character); ''Impossible Spell Card'' (where only [[List of Touhou Project characters#Seija Kijin|Seija Kijin]] is playable); and ''Violet Detector'' (where only Sumireko Usami is playable).

==Development==
The ''Touhou Project'' is a one-man project by a Japanese game maker, Jun'ya Ōta (usually under the pseudonym ZUN), who does all the graphics, music, and programming alone for the bullet hell games, with the exceptions of the portrait art in ''Fairy Wars'', which is by Makoto Hirasaka, and the fighting games, ''Immaterial and Missing Power'', ''Scarlet Weather Rhapsody'', ''Touhou Hisōtensoku'', ''Hopeless Masquerade'', and ''Urban Legend in Limbo'', which were dual efforts with [[Twilight Frontier]].

The idea of ''Touhou'' first came to ZUN during his high school years, when shrine maiden-themed games were in the minority. "It would be nice to make shrine maiden games," he thought, and often imagined the music that would go with such games. He went to college, hoping to compose music for fighting games, since they were popular at the time due to ''[[Street Fighter II]]''. However, he decided that in order to put his music into games, it would be easier to make his own game to go with it, thus the first ''Touhou'' game, ''Highly Responsive to Prayers'', was released in 1996. The first game was originally intended as a practice in programming. ''Touhou'' only became a shooting game series starting from the second game, because the popularity of shooting games had revived due to ''[[RayForce]]'' and ZUN had long been a fan of such games.&lt;ref name="dawn"&gt;{{cite web|author=|url=http://animeiji.s80.xrea.com/event/easterndawn/report1.html|trans-title=Dawn of Touhou|script-title=ja:東方の夜明け|publisher=Meiji University Anime and Voice Actors Research Club|accessdate=2009-07-10|language=Japanese|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090311055603/http://animeiji.s80.xrea.com/event/easterndawn/report1.html|archivedate=2009-03-11|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; ZUN remarked how the general theme and direction of ''Touhou'' only started coming together in the sixth game, ''Embodiment of Scarlet Devil''.&lt;ref name="gensou"&gt;{{cite web|author=Solamarle|url=http://www.gensokyo.org/archives/92#more-92|trans-title=|title=Notes on ZUN's Genyou Denshou Lecture|publisher=Gensokyo.org|date=2007-11-09|accessdate=2009-07-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

ZUN develops his games with [[Visual Studio]], [[Adobe Photoshop]], and [[Steinberg Cubase|Cubase]], according to his interview in ''Bohemian Archive in Japanese Red''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author= ZUN |title= Bohemian Archive in Japanese Red |publisher= [[Ichijinsha]] |date=August 2005 |isbn= 4-7580-1037-4 |page= 166}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A prodigious number of [[derivative work]]s based on ''Touhou'' have been created since the release of ''Embodiment of Scarlet Devil''. These include [[dōjinshi]], [[dōjin music]], dōjin anime, and [[dōjin soft|dōjin games]] (even though the ''Touhou'' games themselves are dōjin games). The vast scope of ''Touhou'' derivatives prompted commentary, noting that ''Touhou Project'' became an unmissable aspect of Japanese [[consumer generated media]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://biz.bcnranking.jp/article/explanation/0810/081020_115573.html|trans-title=The gigantic site of 10 million users sets off a chain reaction of creativity: The freedom of expression through music and video|title=1000万IDの巨大サイトも創作の連鎖反応を引き起こす 音楽や映像で自由に表現|publisher=Weekly BCN|date=2008-10-20|accessdate=2009-07-10|language=Japanese}}&lt;/ref&gt; These dōjin activities are mostly responsible for adding original attributes to characters that ZUN may not have intended. ZUN, for the most part, had acknowledged, appreciated, and even encouraged these derivative works by imposing very few restrictions on the use of his works.&lt;ref name="r25" /&gt; The major restrictions are on unauthorized commercial distribution (as opposed to dōjin) and the [[Spoiler (media)|spoiling of endings]]; proper attribution to Team Shanghai Alice is a recommendation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|publisher=ZUN|url= http://www16.big.or.jp/~zun/html/th10man/html/faq.html#faq32|title=Mountain of Faith: FAQ|accessdate=2009-07-10|language=Japanese}}&lt;/ref&gt; ZUN stated himself that he did not want the ''Touhou Project'' game series to be officially commercialized.
The first recent publication of ''Touhou'' derivative doujinshi occurred during December 2003, following the release of ''Perfect Cherry Blossom''; seven [[Dōjinshi|circles]] sold ''Touhou'' derivative works at Comiket 65 in December 2003. At the Comiket 74 in August 2008, a total of 885 circles had ''Touhou'' derivative works on display or for sale, out of a total of 35,000 circles participating at Comiket.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://addb.jp/index.php?Diary%2F2008-07-30|title=August Dojin Data Base|publisher=Addb.jp|accessdate=2009-02-14|language=Japanese|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110722080729/http://addb.jp/index.php?Diary%2F2008-07-30|archivedate=2011-07-22|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.comiket.co.jp/info-a/WhatIsEng080528.pdf|title=What is the Comic Market?

The dōjin games based on ''Touhou'' include adaptations of other game series' mechanics with ''Touhou'' characters, such as ''Super Marisa Land'' and ''Super Marisa World'' (parodies of the [[Mario]] games with the titles being a play on ''[[Super Mario Land]]'' and ''[[Super Mario World]]'', respectively), ''MegaMari'' (based on the ''[[Mega Man (original series)|Mega Man series]]''), and ''Touhou Soccer'' (based on the ''[[Captain Tsubasa]]'' games by [[Tecmo]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://gaminghell.co.uk/TouhouTime3.html|archive-url=https://archive.is/20130420044622/http://gaminghell.co.uk/TouhouTime3.html|dead-url=yes|archive-date=April 20, 2013|title=Touhou Time: The Fandom of Touhou|publisher=Gaming Hell|accessdate=October 28, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The music of ''Touhou'' is also very popular and many arrangement CDs can be found for sale at Comiket and other Japanese conventions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Gann, Patrick|url=http://www.originalsoundversion.com/favs-of-comiket-fruited-vagabond-review/|title=Favs of Comiket: Fruited Vagabond (Review)|publisher=Original Sound Version|date=August 29, 2012|accessdate=October 28, 2012|quote=Every six months, Comiket sweeps Japan, and a boatload of doujin music albums are released...

Among the most popular derivatives are the series of [[Adobe Flash|Flash]] videos created by the [[dōjin music]] circle [[IOSYS]]. Many of them, one of which is "Marisa Stole the Precious Thing," are popular on otaku [[internet forum]]s and [[Nico Nico Douga]].

[[File:YukkuriShiteIttene!!!.png|thumb|The original "Yukkuri shite itte ne!!!" [[Shift JIS art]].&lt;br&gt;Yukkuri Reimu (left) and Yukkuri Marisa (right)]]

A major [[internet meme]] based on ''Touhou'' is {{nihongo|"Yukkuri shite itte ne!!!"|ゆっくりしていってね!!!||often translated as "You should be taking it easy!!!"}}, which centers around the disembodied, deformed heads of ''Touhou'' characters, often referred to as "yukkuris". This meme originated from a disfigured attempt to draw the main characters Reimu and Marisa with [[Shift JIS art]]. Yukkuris became so popular that the phrase "Yukkuri shite itte ne!!!" won bronze for 2008's "Net Slang of the Year" in Japan.

A dōjin anime project by the dōjin circle Maikaze, titled {{nihongo|''A Summer Day's Dream''|夢想夏郷}}, is a fan-made anime adaptation with an original plot featuring ''Touhou'' characters, with four episodes released from 2008 to 2016, and the 2.5th episode released in 2014; the last episode will be released in 2020.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://maikaze.com/musou/#|title=musoukakyo {{!}} 舞風-Maikaze|publisher=Maikaze|language=Japanese|access-date=July 8, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Albeit created by an amateur studio, the project featured professional voice actors. Another dōjin anime by the circle Manpuku Jinja, titled {{nihongo|''Fantasy Kaleidoscope ~ The Memories of Phantasm''|幻想万華鏡}} (without voice dubbing but have background music and sound), was released at Comiket 80 in 2011, with one episode released based on the storyline of ''Perfect Cherry Blossom'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/news/2011-08-16/touhou-based-the-memories-of-phantasm-posted-online|title=''Touhou''-Based 'The Memories of Phantasm' Anime Streamed|publisher=[[Anime News Network]]|date=August 16, 2011|accessdate=October 28, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; and there are nine episodes as of 2017.

Kyoto Fantasy Troupe,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://kyotofantasytroupe.net/|title=京都幻想剧团|publisher=Kyoto Fantasy Troupe|accessdate=June 24, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; a Chinese dōjin circle, made a dōjin anime titled ''Hifuu Club Activity Record ~ The Sealed Esoteric History'' ({{lang|zh|秘封活动记录}}). The first episode was released at Comiket 89 in late 2015 and Chengdu TouhouOnly05 in early 2016, and it also featured professional Japanese voice actors when it was released again later. The second episode was released in 2017. Another Chinese dōjin circle, Perpetual Motion Niche,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.forevershrine.net/|title=幽幻天仪盘-东方旧作动画{{!}}永动之龛|publisher=Perpetual Motion Niche|accessdate=June 24, 2017|language=Chinese}}&lt;/ref&gt; is also making a dōjin anime titled ''Secluded Magic Instrument~ Meteors of Triple Dimension'' ({{lang|zh|幽幻天仪盘}}), which is about the story of the collision of three worlds——the forgotten Eastern Country (in the PC-98 games), Gensokyo (in the Windows games) and the outside world; the first episode was released in Q3 2017.

The ''Touhou Project'' was nominated for the 11th annual [[Japan Media Arts Festival|Media Arts Awards]] held by Japan's [[Agency for Cultural Affairs]], under the Entertainment category,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://plaza.bunka.go.jp/open/works.html|title=2007 11th Japan Media Arts Festival Open form|publisher=Japan Media Arts Plaza, [[Agency for Cultural Affairs]]|accessdate=2007-11-19|language=Japanese}}&lt;/ref&gt; where ''Touhou Project'' eventually lost to [[Nintendo]]'s ''[[Wii Sports]]'' for the Grand Prize award.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://plaza.bunka.go.jp/english/festival/2007/|title=2007 Eleventh Japan Media Arts Festival Award-winning Works|publisher=Japan Media Arts Plaza, [[Agency for Cultural Affairs]]|accessdate=February 29, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Reitaisai===
The {{Nihongo|'''Hakurei Shrine Reitaisai'''|博麗神社例大祭|Hakurei Jinja Reitaisai|Hakurei Shrine's Regular Grand Festival}} is the largest of the many dōjin conventions hosting only ''Touhou'' content.  Although the coordinator of this convention has nothing to do with Team Shanghai Alice officially, the name "Hakurei Shrine Reitaisai" was given by ZUN himself. It first started in the year 2004 as a way for Team Shanghai Alice to publicly distribute the trial version for their upcoming games to the fans well in advance of releasing them on the internet; in addition, the 2004 Reitaisai featured a total of 114 participating circles. Since then, many ''Touhou'' derivative works are also gathered and sold there. Commencing every year in April or May, the convention has been hosted in [[Ōta, Tokyo]] in 2004; [[Naka-ku, Yokohama]] in 2005; [[Sunshine City, Tokyo]] in 2006 and 2007; and the [[Tokyo Big Sight]] in 2008 and after. The year 2010 saw the birth of Reitaisai SP, an additional Reitaisai to be held every autumn due to increasing popularity, but Reitaisai SP was canceled after 2011. The 2011 Reitaisai was originally canceled due to safety concerns after the [[2011 Tōhoku earthquake and tsunami]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://twitter.com/reitaisai_sp/status/46141410918924288|title=Reitaisai Twitter account|publisher=[[Twitter]]|date=March 11, 2011|accessdate=March 11, 2011|language=Japanese}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was later rescheduled and held on May 8, 2011 with approximately 4,940 participating circles. In addition to events in Japan, there is another Reitaisai held in [[Taiwan]] starting in 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://reitaisai.com/rtstw/|title=博麗神社例大祭 in 台湾|publisher=博麗神社社務所|language=Japanese}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Arrival in New Zealand==
After a conflict in which he killed the son of the chief [[Uenuku]],  Turi departed for New Zealand with many others in the Aotea Canoe.  This canoe had been given to Turi by [[Toto (mythology)|Toto]], father of Turi’s wife [[Rongorongo (wife of Turi)|Rongorongo]]. In some traditions, Turi and his party stopped at Rangitāhua, believed by some to be [[Raoul Island|Raoul]] of the [[Kermadec Islands]], where they encountered some of the crew from the [[Kurahaupō]] canoe.  Continuing on, Turi and his followers eventually arrived and settled at [[Aotea Harbour]] on the west coast of the [[North Island]].

After some time at Aotea Harbour, Turi settled the [[Patea|Pātea]] region where he lived with his people along [[Patea River|Pātea river]].  His daughter Tāneroroa married Ruanui, the eponymous ancestor of [[Ngāti Ruanui]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="11260">The '''U.S.- Italy Fulbright Commission''' is a bi-national, non-profit organization promoting the opportunities for study, research, and teaching in [[Italy]] and the [[United States]]. The commission acts as executor of the [[Fulbright Program]] to and from Italy. Since 1948, the commission has fostered mutual cultural understanding through educational exchange of persons, knowledge, and skills. The commission offers competitive, merit-based grants for students, scholars, teachers, professionals, scientists and artists.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fulbright.it/it|title=The Commission|accessdate=8 November 2012|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121102114314/http://www.fulbright.it/it|archivedate=2 November 2012|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==The U.S.-Italy Fulbright Commission==
Created in 1948, the U.S.-Italy Fulbright Commission is one of 50 bi-national organizations responsible for overseeing the international collaboration of the [[Fulbright Program]], one of the most well-known and prestigious scholarship programs in the world.

The commission is governed by a Board of twelve members: six US members, nominated by the United States Ambassador to Italy, and six Italian members, nominated by the Italian Minister of Foreign Affairs.

The [[Italian Minister of Foreign Affairs]] and the [[United States Ambassador to Italy]] are honorary presidents of the commission.

The [[United States Department of State]], the [[Bureau of Educational and Cultural Affairs]], and the [[Italian Ministry of Foreign Affairs]], General Directorate for Cultural Promotion and Cooperation and General Directorate for the Americas, ensure financial coverage and jointly manage the program.

The commission promotes study, research and lectureship opportunities in Italy and in the United States through the Fulbright scholarships for Italian and American citizens (approximately 100 scholarships a year). It organizes and sponsors cultural and educational activities with both a national and international outreach and offers an Information Service on the Fulbright Program and on study and research opportunities in both the United Statrs and Italy.

==The Fulbright Program==
Currently, the Fulbright Program is the largest program of international cultural exchanges in the United States. It was proposed by Senator [[J. William Fulbright]] of [[Arkansas]]; he believed that an international educational program could be an essential vehicle to promote peace and mutual understanding between individuals, institutions, and future leaders, wherever they may be.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Fulbright Commissions|url=http://fulbright.state.gov/participating-countries/fulbright-commissions|publisher=Bureau of Education and Cultural Affairs|accessdate=8 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The program operates in more than 155 countries worldwide, with approximately 294,000 participants awarded over the course of 60 years. Awards vary between study programs, research or teaching in the United States and other participating countries. Each year, approximately 7,500 Fulbright scholarships are awarded.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1&gt;{{cite web|title=The Fulbright Program|url=http://www.fulbright.it/it/chi-siamo/il-programma|accessdate=8 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Villa Ocampo.gif|thumb|210px|Villa Ocampo]]
'''Villa Ocampo''' is the former house of [[Victoria Ocampo]] (1890 – 1979), one of [[Argentina]]'s greatest cultural figures, founder and director of  ''[[Sur (magazine)|Sur]]'' magazine. The house is located in [[San Isidro, Buenos Aires|San Isidro]], in the province of [[Buenos Aires Province|Buenos Aires]], approximately 30&amp;nbsp;km north of the city of [[Buenos Aires]].

==Creative guests==
Originally the summer house of the Ocampo family, it became Victoria Ocampo's permanent residence in 1940. The house is famous for its list of distinguished visitors who came to Argentina invited by Victoria: [[Rabindranath Tagore]], [[Igor Stravinsky]], [[Le Corbusier]], [[Albert Camus]], [[Graham Greene]], [[Federico García Lorca]], [[André Malraux]], [[José Ortega y Gasset]], [[Antoine de Saint-Exupéry]], [[Saint-John Perse]] (Alexis Léger), among many others. Villa Ocampo was also a regular meeting place for Argentine writers, among them [[Jorge Luis Borges]] and [[Adolfo Bioy Casares]], who met there for the first time in 1931. It was the inspiration for the Blue Villa in [[Alain Robbe-Grillet]]'s 1965 novel ''La Maison de rendez-vous''.

==Design==
The Villa was built in 1891 by Manuel Ocampo, Victoria’s father. Its architecture is eclectic, combining influences of British and French origin. The house is surrounded by an 11,000 m² historical garden and hosts an important collection of art, furnishings and a library of 12,000 books, photographs, letters and personal papers of Victoria Ocampo.

==Landmark==
The house has been owned by [[UNESCO]] since 1973. It was fully restored in 2003 and is now a cultural center open to the public. It welcomes guests from around the world and hosts meetings for distinguished groups such as the Fulbright NEXUS group in 2011.

Visit: From Wednesday to Sunday.

Open: From 12:30 to 18:00 hs

Address: Elortondo 1837. Beccar, San Isidro.

'''Witblits''', or '''"white lightning"''', is a clear spirit that has been distilled in [[South Africa]] for many years. Witblits is predominately produced in the [[Western Cape]] where it has enjoyed over 200 years.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = The Rise of Craft Distillation|url = https://www.jd7.co.za/content.php?num-2|website = www.jd7.co.za|access-date = 2016-02-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many producers take great pride in their product, often brewing small batches to sell at informal markets so as to maintain or improve their recipes. Another name used to describe this alcoholic beverage is "firewater", a name earned without a doubt from the strong punch it delivers.

== Brief History ==

In 1924 [[KWV South Africa (Pty) LTD|KWV]] was granted legal control over the production of wine, spirits and brandy.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Charles W H Kohler|url = http://www.sahistory.org.za/people/charles-w-h-kohler|website = www.sahistory.org.za|access-date = 2016-02-12|last = Anonymous}}&lt;/ref&gt; Accordingly, the distillation of Witblits was criminalized for many years. Although KWV maintained a monopoly on certain lines of liquor, it is evident that many traditions and familial practices could be maintained. Once the ban was lifted distilling for personal use is now legal, provided an appropriate license is obtained.

== Characteristics ==

Witblits is a brandy made from grapes, usually by using leftovers from the winery. Witblits is un-aged, meaning no maturation takes place which results in the liquid staying quite clear. Another one of Witblits' traits is that it is undiluted; this gives it its characteristically high proof. These factors, as with Mampoer,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Distillique - Mampoer, brandy and other liquor definitions|url = http://distillique.co.za/distilling_shop/blog/138-mampoer-brandy-and-other-liquor-definitions|website = distillique.co.za|access-date = 2016-02-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; allow us to classify Witblits as [[Moonshine]]. The association to Moonshine should not necessarily be linked to quality. Many farmers take pride in making witblits using refined handed down recipes&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|title = Mampoer vs Witblits|url = http://food.iafrica.com/happy_hour/142234.html|website = iAfrica.com|access-date = 2016-02-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; resulting in a brandy of higher quality than typical moonshine.

== Witblits Versatility ==

Drinking - The dominant reason for production. Witblits consumption is associated with social activities as well as those of relaxation.

Cleaning Agent - Thanks to Witblits' high alcohol content it is really good at cutting through stains and clean them up. Add to this that the alcohol has a strong smell and evaporates quickly, it can be used to assist with deodorizing too.

Medical Applications - Witblits is a strong disinfectant, again due to the high alcohol content. Alcohol [[Denaturation (biochemistry)|denatures]] proteins very well and by extension germs too. Soaking items in Witblits or rubbing it onto an area
where skin is going to be pierced (Example. injections and piercings) will
reduce the risk of infection.

Herbal Remedies - The high alcoholic content has found use by many as a solvent in [[tincture]]s, increasing the shelf-life and effectiveness of the flowers and herbs in use.

== Marketing and Promotion ==

Various farms producing Witblits in the Western Cape have scheduled witblits tastings and witblits tours to promote the liquor and raise the profile of their brands. In Philippolis, located in the Free State Province, an annual Witblits Festival is held every April, where visitors to the festival and taste and purchase their Witblits liquors.
If you do find yourself attending the Wiblits Festival, be prepared to witness or partake in the ’bokdrol spoeg’&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; a competition which involves spitting Witblits-soaked kudu droppings.

== Legal Concerns ==

Witblits distillation for the purpose of large volume resale is illegal in South Africa. In 1924 the government passed legislation which gave KWV a monopoly on brandy production. All stills had to be marked and registered with Customs and Excise, and detailed records kept as to the amount and strength of any liquor produced. Farmers were allowed to produce liquor only from fruit grown on their land. In the United States of America (USA) Moonshine is illegal mainly due to the revenue that it produces compared to beer or wine. The tax excise on spirits is approximately $2.14 per bottle compared to $0.14 per bottle of wine and $0.05 per can of beer. There is also a concern for the health of consumers thereof and the safety risk behind homemade brewing due to the apparatus involved. In some States a person can still purchase a legal version of witblits or moonshine from commercial distillers. Total volume produced cannot exceed a fixed amount per year as detailed in local South African laws.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = South Africa {{!}} Wine law  {{!}} SAWIS|url = http://www.sawis.co.za/winelaw/southafrica.php|website = www.sawis.co.za|access-date = 2016-02-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Liquor Products Act {{!}} South African Government|url = http://www.gov.za/documents/liquor-products-act-24-mar-2015-1450|website = www.gov.za|access-date = 2016-02-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;
