      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1004">'''Association theory''' (also '''aggregate theory''') is a discredited theory first advanced by chemist [[Thomas Graham (chemist)|Thomas Graham]] in 1861 to describe the molecular structure of substances such as [[cellulose]] and [[starch]], now understood to be [[polymer]]s.  Association theory postulates that such materials are composed of a collection of smaller molecules bound together by an unknown force.  Graham termed these materials [[colloids]].  Prior to the development of [[macromolecule|macromolecular]] theory by [[Hermann Staudinger]] in the 1920s, association theory remained the most prevalent model of polymer structure in the scientific community.

On 20 June 2017 Atanas Skatov climbed solo in alpine style Denali peak in Alaska and became the world's first vegan who climbed the [[Seven Summits]].    

On 13 May 2018 Atanas Skatov climbed solo with out supplemental oxygen Cho Oyu, 8201m.     

== Biography ==
Atanas Skatov was born on 11 March, 1978 in [[Sliven]], [[Bulgaria]]. In 2001, he graduated with distinction from the Agricultural University in [[Plovdiv]], Bulgaria and holds a master's degree in plant protection. During his study he gained two scholarships, allowing him to study for two semesters at [[Humboldt University of Berlin|Humboldt University]], Berlin, Germany. From 2001–2004, he was a full-time PhD student, in the departments of both horticulture and phytomedicine (plant protection). In February 2005, he was awarded a Doctorate degree in Agricultural Science after successfully presenting his dissertation on “Integrated Tomato Production (''Lycopersicon esculentum'') in a glasshouse with an emphasis on integrated and biological pest control against the greenhouse whitefly (''Trialeurodes vaporariorum westwood'')”.

In 2015, he published his first book ''The Mother Goddess of the Universe''.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Богинята Майка на Вселената. Дневникът на един веган|last=|first=|publisher=Кибеа|year=2015|isbn=978-954-474-714-5|location=София|pages=|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the same time his first documentary movie: [https://vimeo.com/151119751 ''Skatov, The Experiment, Episode 1: The First Vegan on Everest''] &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://vimeo.com/151119751|title=The SKATOV experiment|website=Vimeo|access-date=2017-02-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; was released. Skatov has published many scientific articles in Bulgaria and abroad, including instructions for the National Service for Plant Protection. He conducts presentations and motivational meetings. He has been interviewed more than 100 times regarding his latest project: Climbing the 14 highest summits on the planet without consumption of food of animal origin.

Skatov has one son, born in 2009.

Skatov says he had never been on a mountain until 2010, and before 2012 had never been an active sports person. Without passing even a basic mountaineering or climbing training program, he became the first known person of the world on a vegan diet who climbed the highest summits on six of the continents in less than two years, climbing four [[Eight-thousander|eight – thousanders]] in a week apiece. He is the first Bulgarian mountaineer taking part in four expeditions to climb eight-thousanders in a single season.

Skatov became a vegan January 2012, and decided to put on test this kind of diet by climbing the highest summits of each continent in the world, testing his physical and mental endurance. He has chosen the high-altitude mountaineering as it allows a human being to put his physical and mental health under intense pressure.

In 2015, Skatov was awarded a “Honorary Citizen” of Sliven,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://slivenpress.bg/novini-sliven/16481-%D0%9F%D0%95%D0%A2%D0%98%D0%9C%D0%90-%D0%9F%D0%9E%D0%A7%D0%95%D0%A2%D0%9D%D0%98-%D0%93%D0%A0%D0%90%D0%96%D0%94%D0%90%D0%9D%D0%98-%D0%9D%D0%90-%D0%A1%D0%9B%D0%98%D0%92%D0%95%D0%9D|title=ПЕТИМА ПОЧЕТНИ ГРАЖДАНИ НА СЛИВЕН|last=Прес|first=Сливен|website=slivenpress.bg|language=bg-bg|access-date=2017-02-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bulgaria.

== Scientific research ==
Dr. Skatov has conducted scientific researches in areas such as: 
* Morphology; bio ecology and controlling horticultural pests on crops (''Trialeurodes vaporariorum westwood'', ''Tetranychus urticae koch'', ''Bradysia difformis frey'', ''Myzus persicae sulzer'', ''Aphis gossypi glover'', etc.);
* Insecticidal effect of certain plant extracts, such as: pine oil, castor oil, lavender oil, quasi (''Quassia amara''), pyrethrum, azadirachtine, etc.;
* Beneficial insects: Encarsia formosa Gahan, Macrolophus pygmaeus Rambur, Dacnusa sibirica Telenga, Lysiphlebus testacepies Cresson, Phytoseiulus persimilis Athias-Henriot, etc.;
* Entomopathogenic fungi - Verticillium lecanii (Zimmerman) Viegas;
* Pests in stored products;
* Hydroponic methods of growing crops in greenhouses.

== Alpinism and veganism ==
At 14 years of age, as a school boy at the Gymnasium of Electronics and Electrical Engineering in Sliven, he dreamed of completing Bulgaria’s longest high-mountain hiking trail from Kom to Emine (650&amp;nbsp;km). This dream came true 18 years later, in the summer of 2010. In his childhood, until he the age of 18, he had been part of the prominent folklore dance ensemble “Trakiyche”. Until 2012, he had never participated in any sports competitions.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://spisanie8.bg/%D1%80%D1%83%D0%B1%D1%80%D0%B8%D0%BA%D0%B8/%D0%BB%D0%B8%D1%87%D0%BD%D0%BE%D1%81%D1%82%D0%B8/2352-%D0%B4%D1%80-%D1%81%D0%BA%D0%B0%D1%82%D0%BE%D0%B2-%D0%BF%D0%BE-%D1%81%D0%BA%D0%B0%D1%82%D0%BE%D0%B2%D0%B5%D1%82%D0%B5.html|title=Д-р Скатов по скатовете - Списание Осем|newspaper=Списание Осем|access-date=2017-02-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; He started in the summer of 2010, when for the first time he hiked the [[Kom–Emine|Kom-Emine]] trail. Later in 2011 and 2012 repeated the hike, captivated by the magic of the mountain. In the mountains, he considered what could be done for the safety of the planet. Since 2000, he was concerned that the world's population is constantly growing and that agricultural areas are limited. 

At the end of 2011, he had the idea to become a vegan and to climb the highest peaks on all continents as well as all eight–thousanders as a vegan. In that way, he combined veganism and alpinism in his first Project: Climbing the highest peaks on all seven continents as a vegan.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.spisanie8.bg/%D1%80%D1%83%D0%B1%D1%80%D0%B8%D0%BA%D0%B8/%D0%BB%D0%B8%D1%87%D0%BD%D0%BE%D1%81%D1%82%D0%B8/3249-%D0%B4%D1%80-%D1%81%D0%BA%D0%B0%D1%82%D0%BE%D0%B2-%D1%81%D0%BB%D0%B5%D0%B4-%D0%B2%D1%80%D0%B5%D0%BC%D0%B5-%D0%B2%D1%81%D0%B8%D1%87%D0%BA%D0%B8-%D1%89%D0%B5-%D1%81%D0%B5-%D1%81%D1%80%D0%B0%D0%BC%D1%83%D0%B2%D0%B0%D0%BC%D0%B5-%D1%87%D0%B5-%D1%81%D0%BC%D0%B5-%D1%8F%D0%BB%D0%B8-%D0%BC%D0%B5%D1%81%D0%BE.html|title=Д-р Скатов: След време всички ще се срамуваме, че сме яли месо  - Списание Осем|newspaper=Списание Осем|access-date=2017-02-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; In less than two years he reached the highest summits of all seven continents. 

Skatov is self-educated in the subject of climbing and alpinism. He does not conduct preliminary research on a given peak prior to the expedition, in order to feel the spirit of the pioneers who hadn’t known what to expect while climbing.

In 2015, he launched his second project: climbing the 14 highest summits on the planet, the "Crown of the Himalaya” without consumption of food of animal origin (including an expedition to the eighth highest peak on the planet – Manaslu, 8163 m., which had not been climbed by a Bulgarian before). Only Skatov, from all the alpinists present in the autumn of 2015, made three consecutive attempts to attack the peak and on 1 October 2015 at 5:50 am he reached the peak.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.standartnews.com/balgariya-obshtestvo/veganat_skatov_pokoril_manaslu_ot_treti_opit-303791.html#|title=Веганът Скатов покорил Манаслу от трети опит|newspaper=Веганът Скатов покорил Манаслу от трети опит - Общество - Стандарт Нюз|access-date=2017-02-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; Only a few hours prior, another Bulgarian alpinist had climbed the summit in his first attempt. Skatov then became the second Bulgarian and possibly the second vegan in the world to have climbed Manaslu.

In 2016, Skatov took part in three expeditions for climbing eight-thousanders in [[Himalayas]] before monsoons in spring, which no other Bulgarian had done before and there are just a few similar cases in the world. On 16 April he reached 7700 m. of Annapurna I, 8091 m. with another five alpinists, but due to the bad weather is forced to went down to the Base Camp. However, on 1 May 2016 he climbed successfully the tenth highest summit on the planet – Annapurna I, which is the deadliest one, possibly being the first vegan to step on the peak of Annapurna.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.dnevnik.bg/sport/2016/05/01/2752737_atanas_skatov_sushto_izkachi_anapurna/|title=Атанас Скатов също изкачи Анапурна|newspaper=www.dnevnik.bg|access-date=2017-02-13|language=bg}}&lt;/ref&gt; Immediately after Annapurna, he tried to climb Dhaulagiri, 8172 m., reaching 7900 m. in alpine style on 15 May 2016. He didn’t have time for second attempt because he had a bigger target in mind, the fifth highest peak in the world – Makalu, 8485 m. 

Having only one day to rest, after [[Dhaulagiri]] he aimed at Makalu and for only one night at Base Camp, started his climb at Makalu, in alpine style. On 23 May, at 12:00 pm, Skatov became the first known vegan to climb Makalu and, according to the data provided by his fellow mountaineers, he accomplished the fastest expedition to Makalu, for just 96 hours with only one night at the Base Camp before the attack. Thus, for 23 days he participated in three expeditions on eight-thousenders, as two of them in alpine style in less than a week, for the first time in the world from a Bulgarian and a known vegan.

Two weeks after his return from 80-days triple expedition in [[Nepal]], on 15 June 2016 Skatov flew to Pakistan, where he joined in an expedition to [[Gasherbrum I]] and [[Gasherbrum II]]. For Skatov, it is important to constantly pursue the limits of his physical and mental strength while on a vegan diet. After almost a month on Base Camp Gasherbrum, time spent for acclimatization, on 21 July, he headed towards Camp I at Gasherbrum II. On 22 July, a snow started to fall for 26 hours nonstop, so on 23 July, Skatov went down to Base Camp and suspended the expedition.

In conclusion, for 2016, Atanas Skatov participated in four expeditions above 8 000 meters, which hasn’t been done by any other known vegan or a Bulgarian. Atanas Skatov considers that examining the vegan diet is the most prominent scientific research, he has ever done. In January 2017, he marked six years of the beginning of his vegan lifestyle which he says he has no intention to change. He is regularly subject to blood tests, checking the important for a human being indices. Additionally, he maintains a diary regarding sport activities and his mental health.

In 2017, Skatov took part in two expeditions for climbing eight-thousanders in [[Himalayas]] before monsoons. On 16 May 2017 he climbed successfully the fourth highest summit on the planet -Lhotse, 8516m. Only 5 days later Skatov climbed successfully on 22 May Everest, 8848 for second time, but now from south side. So Atanas Skatov is the first Bulgarian, who climbed Mount Everest from north and from south ridges. 

After Lhotse and Everest, Skatov climbed solo in alpine style on 20 June 2017his last one of Seven summits-Denali, 6197m.

'''''Beyond Star Trek: Physics from Alien Invasions to the End of Time''''' is the fourth non-fiction book by the American theoretical physicist [[Lawrence M. Krauss]].  The book was initially published on November 7, 1997 by [[Basic Books]] and since then has appeared in five foreign editions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.utoronto.ca/science-movies-physics-star-trek|title=Science at the Movies: the physics of Star Trek Theoretical astrophysicist Lawrence Krauss on First Contact|publisher=[[utoronto.ca]]|accessdate=2015-07-28|date=2013-02-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;In his previous work, ''[[The Physics of Star Trek]]'', Lawrence Krauss explained a number of ideas and concepts featured in the series; they may or may not exist in our universe. In this book, Krauss goes farther to discuss the realities of physics when it is applied to components from other sci-fi story lines.

==Review==
A reviewer of ''[[Kirkus Reviews]]'' wrote "The author...scored a bestseller with his previous book, ''[[The Physics of Star Trek]]'' (1995). Now he expands his scope to address other sci-fi hits, ranging from the film ''[[2001: A Space Odyssey (film)|2001: A Space Odyssey]]'' to TV's ''[[The X-Files]]''. He also scrutinizes such newsworthy events as the chess match between world champion [[Garry Kasparov]] and an IBM computer. Krauss begins by examining the alien attack on Earth that was portrayed in the movie ''[[Independence Day (1996 film)|Independence Day]]''. He uses basic [[Newtonian physics]] to show that the gravitational effects of the huge arriving alien ships would have caused floods and earthquakes sufficient to destroy our civilization before the invaders had even fired a shot. Next, the author assesses the supposed flight characteristics of UFOs, depicted as stopping on a dime and making sudden sharp turns at utterly unbelievable speeds. Krauss calculates that these maneuvers would create inertial G-forces greater than a close-range nuclear explosion; neither the pilots nor any conceivable construction material could withstand them. Another chapter examines the cost of mounting an interstellar expedition, a journey that would require many decades to complete and cost more than the moon. Later chapters apply the principle of general relativity to star travel, explore computer consciousness, and forecast the end of the world. The book concludes by affirming the author's belief that the universe is a place of boundless potential--and that we must fathom it."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.kirkusreviews.com/book-reviews/lawrence-m-krauss/beyond-star-trek-physics/|title=Beyond Star Trek, Lawrence M.

'''Boyana Glacier''' (Lednik Boyana \'led-nik bo-'ya-na\) in [[Levski Ridge]], [[Tangra Mountains]] on [[Livingston Island]], [[South Shetland Islands]] in Antarctica is situated southeast of [[Macy Glacier]] and west-southwest of [[Srebarna Glacier]].  It is bounded by [[Vazov Rock]] on the west, [[St. Naum Peak]], [[Starosel Gate]], [[Silistra Knoll]] and [[Kotel Gap]] on the north, and [[Christoff Cliff]] on the east.  The glacier extends 3 km in east-west direction and 1.6 km in north-south direction, and flows southeastward into the [[Bransfield Strait]] between [[Vazov Point]] and [[Aytos Point]].

The feature is named after the Bulgarian settlement of [[Boyana]], now part of [[Sofia]].

==Location==
The glacier is centred at {{coord|62|42|18|S|60|05|30|W|display=inline,title|type:glacier}}. Bulgarian mapping in 2005 and 2009.

Campbell]],&lt;ref name="Campbell-1976"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Campbell | first1 = Donald T | year = 1979| title =  Assessing the impact of planned social change| doi = 10.1016/0149-7189(79)90048-X | journal = Evaluation and Program Planning | volume = 2 | issue = 1| pages = 67–90 }}&lt;/ref&gt; a psychologist and [[Social science|social scientist]] who often wrote about [[research methodology]], which states "The more any quantitative [[social indicator]] is used for social decision-making, the more subject it will be to corruption pressures and the more apt it will be to distort and corrupt the social processes it is intended to monitor." (p. 85) On a similar note, Campbell also wrote:&lt;blockquote&gt;Achievement tests may well be valuable indicators of general school achievement ''under conditions of normal teaching aimed at general competence.'' But when test scores become the goal of the teaching process, they both lose their value as indicators of educational status and distort the educational process in undesirable ways. (Similar biases of course surround the use of objective tests in courses or as entrance examinations.)&lt;ref name="Campbell-1976" /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;Campbell's law can be seen as an example of the [[cobra effect]]. The social science principle of Campbell's law is sometimes used to point out the negative consequences of [[high-stakes testing]] in U.S. classrooms.&lt;ref&gt;[http://dianeravitch.net/2012/05/25/what-is-campbells-law/ What is Campbell's Law ''Diane Ravich's Blog'' 25 May, 2012]&lt;/ref&gt; This may take the form of [[teaching to the test]] or outright cheating.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Aviv|first=Rachel|date=21 July 2014|title=Wrong Answer|journal=The New Yorker|url=http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2014/07/21/wrong-answer?currentPage=all}}&lt;/ref&gt; An example is "The High-Stakes Education Rule" as described in the ''Learning-Disadvantage Gap''.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.allartsallkids.org/learning_disadvantage_gap.html&lt;/ref&gt;

There are closely related ideas known by different names, such as [[Goodhart's law]] and the [[Lucas critique]]. Another concept related to Campbell's law emerged in 2006 when UK researchers Rebecca Boden and Debbie Epstein published an analysis of [[evidence-based policy]], a practice espoused by [[Prime Minister of the United Kingdom|Prime Minister]] [[Tony Blair]]. In the paper, Boden and Epstein described how a government that tries to base its policy on evidence can actually end up producing corrupted data because it "seeks to capture and control the knowledge producing processes to the point where this type of 'research' might best be described as '[[policy-based evidence making|policy-based evidence]]'."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Boden|first=Rebecca|last2=Epstein|first2=Debbie|date=2006|title=Managing the research imagination?

When someone distorts decisions in order to improve the performance measure, they often [[Surrogation | surrogate]], coming to believe that the measure is a better measure of true performance than it really is.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Bentley|first=Jeremiah W.|date=2017-02-24|title=Decreasing Operational Distortion and Surrogation through Narrative Reporting|ssrn=2924726|location=Rochester, NY}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Campbell’s Law imparts a more positive but complicated message. It is important to measure progress making use of quantitative and qualitative indicators&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://monitoringevaluation.weebly.com/quantitative--qualitative-indicators.html|title=Quantitative &amp; Qualitative Indicators|website=Monitoring &amp; Evaluation|language=en|access-date=2018-06-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;. However, utilizing quantitative data for evaluation can distort and manipulate these indicators. Concrete measures must be adopted to reduce alteration and manipulation of information. In his article, “Assessing the Impact of Planned Social Change&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|date=1979-01-01|title=Assessing the impact of planned social change|url=https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/014971897990048X|journal=Evaluation and Program Planning|language=en|volume=2|issue=1|pages=67–90|doi=10.1016/0149-7189(79)90048-X|issn=0149-7189}}&lt;/ref&gt;”, Campbell emphasized that “''the more quantitative social indicator used for social decision-making is subjected to corruption pressure and liable to distort and damage social processes it meant to monitor''.” Campbell’s Law helps people discern that the No Child Left Behind and Race to the Top statutes can impair education&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://edexcellence.net/commentary/education-gadfly-daily/common-core-watch/2013/trust-but-verify-the-real-lessons-of-campbells-law.html|title=Trust but verify: The real lessons of Campbell’s Law {{!}} The Thomas B.

In [[sedimentology]], '''compaction''' is the process by which a [[sediment]] progressively loses its [[porosity]] due to the effects of loading. This forms part of the process of [[lithification]]. When a layer of sediment is originally deposited, it contains an open framework of particles with the pore space being usually filled with water. As more sediment is deposited above the layer, the effect of the increased loading is to increase the particle-to-particle stresses resulting in porosity reduction primarily through a more efficient packing of the particles and to a lesser extent through elastic compression and [[pressure solution]]. The initial porosity of a sediment depends on its [[lithology]]. [[Mudstone]]s start with porosities of &gt;60%, [[sandstone]]s typically ~40% and [[carbonate]]s sometimes as high as 70%. Results from [[hydrocarbon exploration]] wells show clear porosity reduction trends with depth.&lt;ref&gt;Sclater, J.G. &amp; Christie, P.A.F. 1980. Continental stretching: an explanation of the post-mid-Cretaceous subsidence of the Central North Sea Basin. Journal of Geophysical Research, 85, 3711–3739&lt;/ref&gt;

In sediments compacted under self-weight, especially in sedimentary basins,the porosity profiles often show an exponential decrease, called Athy's law as first shown by Athy in 1930. A mathematical analytical solution was obtained by Fowler and Yang&lt;ref&gt;A. C. Fowler and X. S. Yang, Fast and slow compaction in sedimentary basins, SIAM J. Appl. Math., 59, 365-385(1998)&lt;/ref&gt; to show the theoretical basis for Athy's law. This process can be easily observed in experiments and used as a good approximation to many real data.&lt;ref&gt;D. B. Bahr, E. W. Hutton, J. P. Syvitski, L. F. Pratson, Exponential approximations to compacted sediment porosity profiles,Computers &amp; Geosciences, 27, 691-700 (2001).&lt;/ref&gt;

==Differential compaction==
If there is a variation in thickness and compactability of a sequence, loading by later deposits will give rise to spatially varying amounts of compaction. This form of compactation is a function of the lithology of the base sediment. Both the thickness and structure of the later sequence will be controlled by the underlying geology in the absence of any active tectonics. Buried tilted [[Fault (geology)|fault]] blocks in a [[rift]] basin often produce large [[Anticline|anticlinal]] closures in the post-rift section that may form traps for [[hydrocarbons]] e.g. the [[Daqing Field]], the largest [[oil field]] in the [[People's Republic of China]] (PRC), in the Songliao Basin.&lt;ref&gt;http://energy.cr.usgs.gov/WEcont/regions/reg3/P3/tps/AU/au314412.pdf| USGS report on the Songliao Basin&lt;/ref&gt;

== 2. Geometric Modeling Principles ==
For the calculation strategy of CASTp, alpha-shape and discrete-flow methods are applied to the protein binding site, also the measurement of pocket size by the program of CAST by Liang et al in 1998,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Edelsbrunner|first=Herbert|last2=Facello|first2=Michael|last3=Liang|first3=Jie|date=1998-11|title=On the definition and the construction of pockets in macromolecules|journal=Discrete Applied Mathematics|volume=88|issue=1–3|pages=83–102|doi=10.1016/s0166-218x(98)00067-5|issn=0166-218X}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Liang|first=Jie|last2=Woodward|first2=Clare|last3=Edelsbrunner|first3=Herbert|date=1998-09|title=Anatomy of protein pockets and cavities: Measurement of binding site geometry and implications for ligand design|journal=Protein Science|volume=7|issue=9|pages=1884–1897|doi=10.1002/pro.5560070905|pmid=9761470|pmc=2144175|issn=0961-8368}}&lt;/ref&gt; then updated by Tian et al in 2018. Firstly, CAST identifies atoms which form the protein pocket, then calculates the volume and area, identifies the atoms forming the rims of pocket mouth, computes how many mouth openings for each pocket, predict the area and circumference of mouth openings, finally locates cavities and calculate their size. The secondary structures were calculated by DSSP.

== 3. Instructions of Protein Pocket Calculation ==
'''3.1 Input'''

Protein structures in PDB format, and a probe radius.

'''3.2 Searching'''

Users can either search for pre-computed result by 4-letter PDB ID, or upload their own PDB file for customized computation. The core algorithm helps in finding the pocket or cavity with capability of housing a solvent, with a default or adjusted diameter.  

'''3.3 Output'''

CASTp identifies all surface pockets, interior cavities and cross channels, provides detailed delineation of all atoms participating in their formation, including the area and volume of pocket or void as well as measurement of numbers of mouth opening of a particular pocket ID by [[Solvent accessible surface area|solvent accessible surface model]] (Richards' surface)&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Lee|first=B.|last2=Richards|first2=F.M.|date=1971-02|title=The interpretation of protein structures: Estimation of static accessibility|journal=Journal of Molecular Biology|volume=55|issue=3|pages=379–IN4|doi=10.1016/0022-2836(71)90324-x|issn=0022-2836}}&lt;/ref&gt; and by molecular surface model ([[Connolly surface]]),&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Connolly|first=M.|date=1983-08-19|title=Solvent-accessible surfaces of proteins and nucleic acids|journal=Science|volume=221|issue=4612|pages=709–713|doi=10.1126/science.6879170|issn=0036-8075}}&lt;/ref&gt; all calculated analytically.

== 4. Why CASTp is Useful? ==
'''4.1 Protein science, from an amino acid to sequences and structures'''

Proteins are large, complex molecules that playing critical roles to maintain the normal functioning of the human body. They are essential not just for the structure and function, but also the regulation among the body’s tissues and organs. Proteins are made up of hundreds of smaller units called amino acids that are attached to one another by peptide bonds, forming a long chain.

'''4.2 Protein active sites'''

Usually, the active site of a protein locates on its center of action and, the key to its function. The first step is the detection of active sites on the protein surface and an exact description of their features and boundaries. These specifications are vital inputs for subsequent target druggability prediction or target comparison. Most of the algorithms for active site detection are based on geometric modeling or energetic features based calculation.

'''4.3 The role of protein pockets'''

The shape and properties of the protein surface determine what interactions are possible with ligands and other macromolecules. Pockets are an important yet ambiguous feature of this surface. During drug discovery process, the first step in screening for lead compounds and potential molecules as drugs is usually a selection of the shape of the binding pocket. Shape plays a role in many computational pharmacological methods. Based on existing results, most features important to predicting drug-binding were depended on size and shape of the binding pocket, with the chemical properties of secondary importance. The surface shape is also important for interactions between protein and water. However, defining discrete pockets or possible interaction sites still remains unclear, due to the shape and location of nearby pockets affected promiscuity and diversity of binding sites. Since most pockets are open to solvent, to define the border of a pocket is the primary difficulty. Those closed to solvent we refer to as buried cavities. With the benefit of well-defined extent, area and volume, buried cavities are more straightforward to locate. In contrast, the border of an open pocket defines its mouth and it provides the cut-off for determination of the surface area and volume. Even defining the pocket as a set of residues does not define the volume or the mouth of the pocket.

'''4.4 Druggability role prediction'''

In pharmaceutical industry, the current priority strategy for target assessment is high-throughput screening (HTS). NMR screenings are applied against large compound datasets. Chemical characteristics of compounds binding against specific targets are measured, so how well the compound sets bind to the chemical space will decide the binding efficiency. Success rates of virtually docking of the drug-like ligands into the active sites of the target proteins would be detected for prioritization, while the most of the active sites located at the pockets.

With the benefits of large amount of structural data, computational methods from different perspectives for druggability prediction have been introduced during the last 30 years with positive results, as a vital instrument to accelerate the prediction accessibility.  Many candidates have been integrated into drug discovery pipeline already since then.

==5. New Features in CASTp 3.0==
'''5.1 Pre-computed results for biological assemblies'''

For a lot of proteins deposited in Protein Data Bank, the asymmetric unit might be different from biological unit, which would make the computational result biologically irrelevant. So the new CASTp 3.0 computed the topological features for biological assemblies, overcome the barriers between asymmetric unit and biological assemblies.

'''5.2 Imprints of negative volumes of topological features'''

In the 1st release of CASTp server in 2006, only geometric and topological features of those surface atoms participated in the formation of protein pockets, cavities, and channels. The new CASTp added the “negative volume” of the space, referred to the space encompassed by the atoms formed these geometric and topological features.

'''5.3 Comprehensive annotation on single amino-acid polymorphism'''

The latest CASTp integrated protein annotations aligned with the sequence, including the brief feature, positions, description, and reference of the domains, motifs, and single amino-acid polymorphisms.

'''5.4 Improved user interface &amp; convenient visualization'''

The new CASTp now incorporated 3Dmol.js for structural visualization, made users able to browse, to interact the protein 3D model, and to examine the computational results in latest web-browsers including Chrome, Firefox, Safari, et al. Users can pick their own representation style of the atoms which form each topographic feature, and to edit the colors by their own preferences.

'''''Computer Graphics: Principles and Practice''''' is a [[textbook]] written by [[John F. Hughes]], [[Andries van Dam]], [[Morgan McGuire]], [[David F. Sklar]], [[James D. Foley]], [[Steven K. Feiner]], and [[Kurt Akeley]] and published by [[Addison–Wesley]]. First published in 1982 as ''Fundamentals of Interactive Computer Graphics'', it is widely considered a classic standard reference book on the topic of [[Computer graphics (computer science)|computer graphics]]. It is sometimes known as ''the bible of computer graphics'' (due to its size).

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="12193">In [[climatology]], the '''Coupled Model Intercomparison Project''' (CMIP) is a collaborative framework designed to improve knowledge of [[climate change]], being the analog of [[Atmospheric Model Intercomparison Project]] (AMIP) for global coupled ocean-atmosphere general circulation models (GCMs). It was organized in 1995 by the Working Group on Coupled Modelling (WGCM) of the [[World Climate Research Programme]]’s (WCRP). It is developed in phases to foster the climate model improvements but also to support national and international assessments of climate change. 

== CMIP phases ==


The [[Program for Climate Model Diagnosis and Intercomparison]] at [[Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory]] has been supporting the several CMIP phases by helping WGCM to determine the scope of the project, by maintaining the project's data base and by participating in data analysis. CMIP has received model output from the pre-industrial climate simulations ("control runs") and 1% per year increasing-CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; simulations of about 30 coupled GCMs. More recent phases of the project (20C3M, ...) include more realistic scenarios of climate forcing for both historical, paleoclimate and future scenarios.

=== CMIP Phases 1 and 2 ===


According to [[Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory]] PCMDI, the response to the CMIP1 announcement was very successful and up to 18 global coupled models participated in the data collection representing most of the international groups with global coupled GCMs. In consequence, at the September 1996 meeting of CLIVAR NEG2 in Victoria, Canada, it was decided that CMIP2 will be an inter-comparison of 1% per year compound CO2 increase integrations (80 years in length) where CO2 doubles at around year 70. 

=== CMIP Phase 3 ===


During 2005 and 2006, a collection of climate model outputs was coordinated and stored by PCMDI &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://pcmdi.llnl.gov/mips/cmip3/ |title=CMIP3-Info |website=pcmdi.llnl.gov|language=en|access-date=2018-05-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;. The climate model outputs included simulations of past, present and future climate scenarios  This activity enabled those climate models, outside the major modeling centers to perform research of relevance to climate scientists preparing the [[ IPCC Fourth Assessment Report ]] (IPCC-AR4). For the CMIP3 a list of 20 different experiments were proposed &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://pcmdi.llnl.gov/ipcc/standard_output.html#Experiments|title=CMIP3-Experiments |website=pcmdi.llnl.gov|language=en|access-date=2018-05-20 }}&lt;/ref&gt;, and the PCMDI kept the  documentation of all the global climate model involved  &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://pcmdi.llnl.gov/ipcc/model_documentation/ipcc_model_documentation.html  |title=CMIP3-Models |website=pcmdi.llnl.gov|language=en|access-date=2018-05-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;. Additional information and data-sets are in &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://cmip.llnl.gov/cmip3_overview.html |title=CMIP3-Overview |website=cmip.llnl.gov|language=en|access-date=2018-05-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;. 

=== CMIP Phase 5 ===

The most recently completed phase of the project (2010-2014) is CMIP5.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://esgf-node.llnl.gov/projects/esgf-llnl/|title=ESGF-LLNL - Home {{!}} ESGF-CoG|website=esgf-node.llnl.gov|language=en|access-date=2017-10-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.economist.com/news/science-and-technology/21729423-new-estimates-permissible-carbon-dioxide-emissions-notwithstanding-there|title=There is still no room for complacency in matters climatic|work=The Economist|access-date=2017-10-09|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; CMIP5 included more [[metadata]] describing model simulations than previous phases. The [[METAFOR]] project created an exhaustive [[Conceptual model|schema]] describing the scientific, technical, and numerical aspects of CMIP runs which was archived along with the output data.

A main objective of the CMIP5 experiments is to address outstanding scientific questions that arose as part of the IPCC AR4 process, improve understanding of climate, and to provide estimates of future climate change that will be useful to those considering its possible consequences. The [[ IPCC Fifth Assessment Report]] summarizes information of CMIP5 experiments, while the CMIP5 experimental protocol was endorsed by the 12th Session of the WCRP Working Group on Coupled Modelling (WGCM) &lt;ref name="CMIP5Design"&gt;{{

=== CMIP Phase 6 ===

Planning meetings for Phase 6 began in 2013, and an overview of the design and organization was published in 2016. By 2018 CMIP6 had endorsed 23 Model Intercomparison Projects (MIPs) involving 33 modeling groups in 16 countries. A small number of common experiments were also planned. The deadline for submission of papers to contribute to the IPCC 6th Assessment Report Working Group I is early 2020.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Eyring |first1=Veronika |last2=et al. |title=Overview of the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 6 (CMIP6) Experimental Design and Organization |url=https://www.wcrp-climate.org/images/modelling/WGCM/CMIP/CMIP6FinalDesign_GMD_180329.pdf |accessdate=6 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''structure of the CMIP6''' has been extended with respect to CMIP5 by providing an equivalent framework named CMIP Diagnostic, Evaluation and Characterization of Klima (DECK), together with a set of Endorsed MIPs   to improve the description of aspects of climate models beyond the core set of common experiments included in DECK. However, CMIP-Endorsed Model Intercomparison Projects (MIPs) are still built on the DECK and CMIP historical simulations, therefore their main goal is just to address a wider range of specific questions [https://www.wcrp-climate.org/modelling-wgcm-mip-catalogue/modelling-wgcm-cmip6-endorsed-mips]. This structure will be kept in future CMIP experiments.

CMIP6 also aims to be consistent regarding common standards and documentation. To achieve that it includes methods to facilitate a wider distribution and characterization of model outputs, and common standard tools for their analyses. A number of guides has been created [https://www.wcrp-climate.org/wgcm-cmip/wgcm-cmip6] for data managers, modelers and users. 

A set of official/common forcings datasets are available for the studies under DECK, as well as several MIPS. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://docs.google.com/document/d/1pU9IiJvPJwRvIgVaSDdJ4O0Jeorv_2ekEtted34K9cA/edit#heading=h.jdoykiw7tpen|title=CMIP6_Forcing_Datasets_Summary|work=Google Docs|access-date=2018-07-18|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; That allows for more sensible comparisons on the model ensemble created under the CMIP6 umbrella. 

These '''common dataset forcings''' [https://www.wcrp-climate.org/wgcm-cmip/wgcm-cmip6?view=article&amp;id=1321:modelling-wgcm-cmip6-historycmip6forcings&amp;catid=55] are stored and coordinated by input4MIPS (input datasets for Model Intercomparison Projects).

[[Evolutionary psychology]] has generated substantial controversy and criticism. The criticism  includes but is not limited to: disputes about the testability of evolutionary hypotheses, alternatives to some of the cognitive assumptions (such as massive modularity) frequently employed in evolutionary psychology, alleged vagueness stemming from evolutionary assumptions (such as uncertainty about the environment of evolutionary adaptation), differing stress on the importance of non-genetic and non-adaptive explanations, and political and ethical issues.&lt;ref name="Plotkin, Henry p.150"&gt;{{cite book |author=Plotkin, Henry |date=2004 |title=Evolutionary thought in Psychology: A Brief History |publisher=Blackwell |page=150}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While evolutionary psychology has been accused of [[straw man]] evidence, ideologically rather than scientifically motivated, evolutionary psychologists respond by arguing that these criticisms are also straw men, are based on an incorrect [[nature versus nurture]] dichotomy, or are based on misunderstandings of the discipline.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1=Confer | first1=J.

==Massive modularity==
{{main|Modularity of mind}}
Evolutionary psychologists have postulated that the mind is composed of cognitive modules specialized to perform specific tasks. Evolutionary psychologists have theorized that these specialized modules enabled our ancestors to react quickly and effectively to environmental challenges. As a result, [[Domain specificity|domain-specific]] modules would have been selected for, whereas broad general-purpose cognitive mechanisms that worked more slowly would have been eliminated in the course of evolution.&lt;ref name=Hamilton&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Hamilton |first1=Richard |year=2008 |title=The Darwinian cage: Evolutionary psychology as moral science |journal=Theory Culture and Society |volume=25 |issue=2 |pages=105–25 |publisher=|doi=10.1177/0263276407086793 |url=http://researchonline.nd.edu.au/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1002&amp;context=phil_article&amp;sei-redir=1&amp;referer=http%3A%2F%2Fscholar.google.com%2Fscholar%3Fhl%3Den%26q%3DDarwinian%2Bcage%2Bevolutionary%2Bpsychology%26btnG%3D%26as_sdt%3D1%252C5%26as_sdtp%3D#search=%22Darwinian%20cage%20evolutionary%20psychology%22 |accessdate=March 30, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Ward&gt;{{cite book |last1=Ward |first1=Chuck |editor1-first=Kathryn S. |editor1-last=Plaisance |editor1-link=|editor2-first=Thomas A.

Specifically, they posit that someone who received a benefit and does not pay the cost is cheating. However, in real-life social exchange situations people can benefit and not pay without cheating (as in the case of receiving gifts or benefiting from charity).&lt;ref name="Davies"/&gt;

Some critics have suggested that our genes cannot hold the information to encode the brain and all its assumed modules.&lt;ref name=peters/&gt; Humans share a significant portion of their genome with other species and have corresponding DNA sequences so that the remaining genes must contain instructions for building specialized circuits that are absent in other mammals.&lt;ref name=peters/&gt;&lt;ref name=ehrlichfeldman&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Ehrlich |first1=Paul |last2=Feldman |first2=Marcus |title=Genes and Cultures: What Creates Our Behavioral Phenome? |journal=[[Current Anthropology]] |volume=44 |issue=1 |year=2003 |pages=87–107 |doi=10.1086/344470 |url=http://www.stanford.edu/group/CCB/Pubs/paulpdfs/2003_EhrlichandFeldman_whatcreatesour.pdf |accessdate=May 4, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Ehrlich |first1=Paul |last2=Ehrlich |first2=Anne H. |title=The Dominant Animal: Human Evolution and the Environment |chapter=Of Genes and Culture |chapterurl=https://books.google.com/books?id=G626f_bN_28C&amp;pg=PA68 |publisher=[[Island Press]] |location=Washington, DC |year=2009 |pages=68–96 |isbn=1-59726-097-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One controversy concerns the particular modularity of mind theory used in evolutionary psychology (massive modularity). Critics argue in favor of other theories.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Samuels |first=Richard |year=1998 |title=Evolutionary Psychology and the Massive Modularity Hypothesis |journal=[[British Journal for the Philosophy of Science]] |volume=49 |issue=4 |pages=575–602 |doi=10.1093/bjps/49.4.575 |url=http://sas-space.sas.ac.uk/937/1/R_Samuels_Evolutionary.pdf |accessdate=May 3, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Buller |first1=David J. |last2=Hardcastle |first2=Valerie |year=2000 |title=Evolutionary Psychology, Meet Developmental Neurobiology: Against Promiscuous Modularity |journal=Brain and Mind |volume=1 |issue=3 |pages=307–25 |publisher=|doi=10.1023/A:1011573226794 |url=http://commons.lib.niu.edu/bitstream/10843/13181/1/evolutionarypsych.pdf |accessdate=March 23, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Fear and phobias as innate or learned ==
Critics have questioned the proposed innateness of certain [[phobia]]s, such as fear of snakes.&lt;ref&gt;Buller, David. (2005) ''Adapting Minds''.&lt;/ref&gt; Recent evidence, however, suggests that Japanese macaques, and presumably other primates, have a [[Snake Detection Theory|snake-detection]] brain module—neurons in the preferential medial and dorsolateral pulvinar—that respond very rapidly to images of snakes, even without any prior exposure to snakes.&lt;ref&gt;Vence, T.

== Environment of evolutionary adaptedness ==

One method employed by evolutionary psychologists is using knowledge of the environment of evolutionary adaptedness to generate [[hypotheses]] regarding possible psychological adaptations.

Part of the critique of the scientific basis of evolutionary psychology is of the concept of the environment of evolutionary adaptation. Evolutionary psychology often assumes that human evolution occurred in a uniform environment, and critics suggest that we know so little about the environment (or probably multiple environments) in which homo sapiens evolved, that explaining specific traits as an adaption to that environment becomes highly speculative.&lt;ref name="Plotkin, Henry p.149"&gt;Plotkin, Henry. 2004 Evolutionary thought in Psychology: A Brief History. Blackwell. p.149.&lt;/ref&gt;

The evolutionary psychologists John Tooby and Leda Cosmides state that research is confined to certainties about the past, such as pregnancies only occurring in women, and that humans lived in groups. They argue that there are many environmental features that are known regarding our species' evolutionary history. They argue that our [[hunter-gatherer]] ancestors dealt with predators and prey, [[foraging|food acquisition]] and sharing, mate choice, child rearing, interpersonal aggression, interpersonal assistance, diseases and a host of other fairly predictable challenges that constituted significant selection pressures. Knowledge also include things such as nomadic, kin-based lifestyle in small groups, long life for mammals, low fertility for mammals, long female pregnancy and lactation, cooperative hunting and aggression, tool use, and sexual division of labor.&lt;ref&gt;The Handbook of Evolutionary Psychology (2005), David M. Buss, Chapter 1, pp. 5-67, Conceptual Foundations of Evolutionary Psychology, John Tooby and Leda Cosmides&lt;/ref&gt;

== Empirical evidence ==
Some hypotheses that certain psychological traits are evolved adaptations have not been empirically corroborated.&lt;ref name="TDB"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thedailybeast.com/newsweek/2009/06/19/why-do-we-rape-kill-and-sleep-around.html|title=Why Do We Rape, Kill and Sleep Around?|first= Sharon|last=Begley|website=The Daily Beast|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110917175113/http://www.thedailybeast.com/newsweek/2009/06/19/why-do-we-rape-kill-and-sleep-around.html|archive-date=September 17, 2011|date=June 19, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Rape and attraction to aggression===

Smith et al. (2001) criticized [[A Natural History of Rape|Thornhill and Palmer's hypothesis]] that a predisposition to rape in certain circumstances might be an evolved sexually dismorphic psychological adaptation. They developed a fitness cost/benefit mathematical model and populated it with estimates of certain parameters (some parameter estimates were based on studies of the [[Aché people|Aché]] in Paraguay). Their model suggested that, on average, the costs of rape for a typical 25-year-old male outweigh benefits by a factor of ten to one. On the basis of their model and parameter estimates, they suggested that this would make it unlikely that rape generally would have net fitness benefits for most men. They also find that rape from raiding other tribes has lower costs but does not offer net fitness benefits, making it also unlikely that was an adaptation.&lt;ref name="TDB"/&gt;&lt;ref name="SEM"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Smith |first1=Eric |last2=Mulde |first2=Monique|last3=Hill|first3=Kim |year=2001 |title=Controversies in the evolutionary social sciences: a guide for the perplexed|journal=[[Trends in Ecology &amp; Evolution]] |volume=16 |issue=3 |pages=128–35 |url=http://instruct.uwo.ca/psychology/371g/Smith2001.pdf|accessdate=July 1, 2013 |doi=10.1016/s0169-5347(00)02077-2 |pmid=11179576}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Beckerman et al. (2009) disputed explanations of male aggression as a reproductive strategy. In a study of the [[Huaorani people|Waorani]] tribes, the most aggressive warriors had the fewest descendants.&lt;ref name="TDB"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Beckerman"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Beckerman|first1=Stephen |last2=Erickson|first2=Pamela |last3=Yost|first3=James|last4=Regalado|first4=

===Waist-to-hip ratios===
Others have criticized the assertion that men universally preferred women with a [[Waist–hip ratio|waist-to-hip ratio]] of 0.7 or the "hourglass" figure. Studies of peoples in Peru and Tanzania found that men preferred ratios of 0.9.&lt;ref name="TDB"/&gt; Cashdan (2008) found that in male preferences for waist-to-hip ratios varied and were correlated to economic dependence for women; societies with less economic equality such as Greece, Japan and Portugal favored lower ratios while more egalitarian societies favored higher hip ratios.&lt;ref name="TDB"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Cashdan"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Cashdan |first=Elizabeth |year=2008 |title=Waist-to-Hip Ratio across Cultures: Trade-Offs between Androgen- and Estrogen-Dependent Traits |journal=[[Current Anthropology]] |volume=49 |issue=6 |url=http://www1.anthro.utah.edu/PDFs/cashdan/whr.pdf |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100609210821/http://www.anthro.utah.edu/PDFs/cashdan/whr.pdf |dead-url=yes |archive-date=June 9, 2010 |accessdate=July 1, 2013 |doi=10.1086/593036 |pages=1099–1107}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Recent studies utilizing realistic stimuli{{clarify|date=September 2017}}, by contrast, show that men display a cross-cultural consensus in preferring a low waist-to-hip ratio (i.e., hourglass-like figure), with some fluctuation depending on whether the local ecology is nutritionally-stressed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Singh|first1=Devendra|last2=Dixson|first2=B.

===Hidden hunger, female curves and intertribal trade===
A number of theories in evolutionary psychology that are hinged on the assumption that sheer number of [[calory|calories]] constitute the only important bottleneck in [[nutrient|nutrition]] are challenged by research on hidden hunger, types of [[malnutrition]] in which deficits of specific essential micronutrients cause diseases or even death despite a suitable number of calories. Comparisons between species show that although human brains consume more nutrients than the brains of other species, human brains consuming roughly 20% of the body's total calory requirements in adult humans and 60% in young children, there are other organs in many other species that consume more calories than their human counterparts. This means that humans do not stand out in requirements for calories at any stage of life, though human brains stand out in requiring higher amounts of many different essential nutrients while other organs in other species may require higher amounts of two or three specific micronutrients. While studies of blood flow in the brain's [[dura mater]] in fossil humans show a negligible difference in oxygen and with it caloric requirements between [[Neanderthal]]s and modern humans, the fact that some Neanderthal groups in Belgium lived exclusively of large land animal meat while other Neanderthal groups in Spain lived exclusively of plants that were present there at the time with a much narrower range of nutrients than the diets [[veganism|vegans]] eat today shows that although Neanderthals were capable of varying their diets, they could also survive off non-varied diets that would cause lethal deficits in modern humans. Since many micronutrient deficits in modern humans cause neurological symptoms, this is explainable as a result of less flexible synapses in Neanderthal brains requiring lower levels of many specific mincronutrients than the highly flexible synapses of modern humans. This contradicts the claim that human females were under unique selection pressure to evolve curvy shapes for fat storage for fetal brain development, as fat would only store calories and not micronutrients which could be stored without affecting body shape and nonhuman animals with other high fetal calory requirements do not have curvy females. The claim that human females evolved large breasts to feed infants needing many calories is also challenged, empirically citing the human example that while most asian women have small breasts, asian people do not have smaller brains than other people and that explaining it away as a "trade-off" would be a misuse of the term as the observation is one trait (brain size) being unaffected by a dramatic reduction of another trait (breast size) as opposed to the correct definition of "trade-off" which is an otherwise adaptive trait being reduced by a change of something else. The distribution of essential nutrients between different types of food varied dramatically between regions in the [[paleolithic]] before the exchange of breeding stock of domestic and feral plants and animal species over long distances at the dawn of [[agriculture]] and the many micronuitrients required in higher levels by sapiens than by archaics meant that in every region, one or more types of food became narrower bottlenecks for sapiens group size than for archaic group size though the specific bottleneck food varied from region to region. This contradicts evolutionary psychology's claim that sapiens evolved in larger group sizes and since many essential nutreients are in types of food that cannot be prevented from going rancid in short times while other essential nutrients degrade fast even if the food in which they are contained does not become rancid, trade over long distances could not address the problem. The discovery of stone tools further from the origin of the stone at sapiens sites than at archaic sites is therefore not explainable by trade between tribes, but can be explained by people moving further to eat the essential nutrients and that the same movement patterns in other sapiens groups making them less capable of consistent territorial defense than archaics were, allowing sapiens to move longer and take their tools with them. It also challenges evolutionary psychology's claim of an universal exchange value of animal versus vegetable food that would have maintained an universal division of labour between hunting men and gathering women and/or a need for stable pair bonds in a context of paying for guard services with food within the tribe, as the most valuable essential micronutrient food would have been animal in some regions yet vegetable in other regions and such differences were commonly found between different localities within the relatively large part of Africa in which Homo sapiens evolved as a number of interbreeding groups.&lt;ref&gt;Jonathan Silvertown (2017) "Dinner with Darwin: Food, Drink, and Evolution"&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Patricia C. Rice, Norah Moloney (2016) "Biological Anthropology and Prehistory: Exploring Our Human Ancestry"&lt;/ref&gt;

== Testability ==
A frequent criticism of evolutionary psychology is that its hypotheses are difficult or impossible to test, challenging its status as an empirical science. As an example, critics point out that many current traits likely evolved to serve different functions from those they do now, confounding attempts to make backward inferences into history.&lt;ref name="Psychology"&gt;Schacter, Daniel L, Daniel Wegner and Daniel Gilbert. 2007. Psychology. Worth Publishers. pp. 26-27&lt;/ref&gt; Evolutionary psychologists acknowledge the difficulty of testing their hypotheses but assert it is nevertheless possible.&lt;ref name="Buss, Haselton 2007. pp. 26-27"&gt;"Testing ideas about the evolutionary origins of psychological phenomena is indeed a challenging task, but not an impossible one (Buss, Haselton, Shackelford, Bleske, &amp; Wakefield, 1998; Pinker, 1997b)." Schacter, Daniel L, Daniel Wegner and Daniel Gilbert. 2007. Psychology. Worth Publishers. pp. 26-27&lt;/ref&gt;

Critics argue that many hypotheses put forward to explain the adaptive nature of human behavioural traits are "[[just-so stories]]"; neat adaptive explanations for the evolution of given traits that do not rest on any evidence beyond their own internal logic.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Plotkin |first=Henry C. |title=Evolutionary thought in psychology: a brief history |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=CKoRENaag8YC&amp;pg=PA118 |year=2004 |publisher=[[Wiley-Blackwell]] |isbn=978-1-4051-1377-9 |page=118 }}&lt;/ref&gt; They allege that evolutionary psychology can predict many, or even all, behaviours for a given situation, including contradictory ones. Therefore, many human behaviours will always fit some hypotheses. [[Noam Chomsky]] argued:

:"You find that people cooperate, you say, 'Yeah, that contributes to their genes' perpetuating.' You find that they fight, you say, ‘Sure, that’s obvious, because it means that their genes perpetuate and not somebody else's. In fact, just about anything you find, you can make up some story for it."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title=The Undiscovered Mind: How the Brain Defies Explanation | first=John | last=Horgan | authorlink=John Horgan (American journalist) | origyear=1999 | year=2000 | publisher=Phoenix | location=London | pages=179}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Chomsky versus Trivers |author=Horgan, John |date=September 28, 2006 |url=http://www.stevens.edu/csw/cgi-bin/blogs/horganism/?p%3D11 |accessdate=April 14, 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090906015525/http://www.stevens.edu/csw/cgi-bin/blogs/horganism/?p=11 |archivedate=September 6, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Leda Cosmides]] argued in an [http://www.psych.ucsb.edu/research/cep/ledainterview.htm interview]:

:"Those who have a professional knowledge of evolutionary biology know that it is not possible to cook up after the fact explanations of just any trait. There are important constraints on evolutionary explanation. More to the point, every decent evolutionary explanation has testable predictions about the design of the trait. For example, the hypothesis that pregnancy sickness is a byproduct of prenatal hormones predicts different patterns of food aversions than the hypothesis that it is an adaptation that evolved to protect the [[fetus]] from pathogens and plant toxins in food at the point in embryogenesis when the fetus is most vulnerable – during the first trimester. Evolutionary hypotheses – whether generated to discover a new trait or to explain one that is already known – carry predictions about the nature of that trait. The alternative – having no hypothesis about adaptive function – carries no predictions whatsoever. So which is the more constrained and sober scientific approach?"

A 2010 review article by evolutionary psychologists describes how an evolutionary theory may be empirically tested. A hypothesis is made about the evolutionary cause of a psychological phenomenon or phenomena. Then the researcher makes predictions that can be tested. This involves predicting that the evolutionary cause will have caused other effects than the ones already discovered and known. Then these predictions are tested. The authors argue numerous evolutionary theories have been tested in this way and confirmed or falsified.&lt;ref name=AmPs2010&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Confer | first1 = J.

Accordingly, he views evolutionary psychology as a [[paradigm]] rather than a theory, and  attributes this view to prominent evolutionary psychologists including Cosmides, Tooby, Buss, and Pinker.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1=Buller | first1=D. | year=2005 | title=Evolutionary psychology: the emperor's new paradigm | url=| journal=Trends in Cognitive Sciences | volume=9 | issue=6| pages=277–283 | doi=10.1016/j.tics.2005.04.003 | pmid=15925806}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In his review article "Discovery and Confirmation in Evolutionary Psychology" (in The Oxford Handbook of Philosophy of Psychology) Edouard Machery concludes:&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pitt.edu/~machery/papers/Discovery_and_Confirmation_in_Evolutionary_Psychology_FINAL.pdf Discovery and Confirmation in Evolutionary Psychology]&lt;/ref&gt;

:"Evolutionary psychology remains a very controversial approach in psychology, maybe because skeptics sometimes have little first-hand knowledge of this field, maybe because the research done by evolutionary psychologists is of uneven quality. However, there is little reason to endorse a principled skepticism toward evolutionary psychology: Although clearly fallible, the discovery heuristics and the strategies of confirmation used by evolutionary psychologists are on a firm grounding."

== Ethnocentrism ==
One aspect of evolutionary psychology is finding traits that have been shown to be universal in humans. Many critics have pointed out that many traits considered universal at some stage or another by evolutionary psychologists often turn out to be dependent on cultural and particular historical circumstances.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Paulson |first1=William R. |authorlink1=|title=Literary Culture in a World Transformed: A Future for the Humanities |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=aFH-A8VQoxwC&amp;pg=PA83 |year=2001 |publisher=[[Cornell University Press]] |location=Ithaca |isbn=978-0-8014-8730-9 |page=83 |pages=|chapter=|chapterurl=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Lancaster 2003"&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://www.ucpress.edu/book.php?isbn=9780520236202|title=The Trouble with Nature: Sex in Science and Popular Culture|last=Lancaster|first=Roger|publisher=University of California Press|year=2003|isbn=9780520236202|location=Berkeley|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Davies |first1=Stephen |authorlink1=Stephen Davies (philosopher) |title=The Artful Species: Aesthetics, Art, and Evolution |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=2rbn9pkAfjEC&amp;pg=PA142 |year=2012 |publisher=[[Oxford University Press]] |location=Oxford |isbn=978-0-19-965854-1 |page=142 |chapter=|chapterurl=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Critics allege that evolutionary psychologists tend to assume that their own current cultural context represents a universal human nature. For example, [[Anthropology|anthropologist]] Susan McKinnon argues that evolutionary theories of [[kinship]] rest on [[Ethnocentrism|ethnocentric]] presuppositions. Evolutionary psychologists assert that the degree of genetic relatedness determines the extent of kinship (e.g., solidarity, nurturance, and altruism) because in order to maximize their own reproductive success, people "invest" only in their own genetic children or closely related kin. [[Steven Pinker]], for instance, stated "You're either someone's mother or you aren't". McKinnon argues that such biologically centered constructions of relatedness result from a specific cultural context: the kinship category "mother" is relatively self-evident in Anglo-American cultures where biology is privileged but not in other societies where rank and marital status, not biology, determine who counts as a mother or where mother's sisters are also considered mothers and one's mother's brother is understood as the "male mother".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=McKinnon |first1=Susan |authorlink1=|authorlink2=|editor1-first=Susan |editor1-last=McKinnon |editor2-first=Sydel |editor2-last=Silverman |title=Complexities: Beyond Nature and Nurture |url=|year=2005 |publisher=University of Chicago Press |location=Chacago |isbn=978-0-226-50023-2 |page=|pages=106–131 |chapter=On Kinship and Marriage: A Critique of the Genetic and Gender Calculus of Evolutionary Psychology |chapterurl=https://books.google.com/books?id=QR-LfboRTwUC&amp;pg=PA106 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a review of Pinker's book on evolutionary psychology (''[[The Blank Slate]]''), [[Louis Menand]] wrote: "''In general, the views that Pinker derives from 'the new sciences of human nature' are mainstream Clinton-era views: incarceration is regrettable but necessary; sexism is unacceptable, but men and women will always have different attitudes toward sex; dialogue is preferable to threats of force in defusing ethnic and nationalist conflicts; most group stereotypes are roughly correct, but we should never judge an individual by group stereotypes; rectitude is all very well, but 'noble guys tend to finish last'; and so on.''"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Menand |first=Louis |title=What Comes Naturally |work=[[The New Yorker]] |date=November 22, 2002 |url=http://www.newyorker.com/archive/2002/11/25/021125crbo_books |accessdate=March 26, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, evolutionary psychologists{{who|date=July 2011}} point out that their research actually focuses on commonalities between people of different cultures to help to identify "human psychological nature" and [[cultural universals]]. It is not a focus on local behavioral variation (which may sometimes be considered ethnocentric) that interests evolutionary psychologists; rather their focus is to find underlying psychological commonalities between people from various cultures.&lt;ref&gt;Buss, D. M. (2011) ''Evolutionary Psychology: The New Science of the Mind''. Psychology Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Reductionism and determinism ==
Some critics view evolutionary psychology as influenced by [[genetic determinism]] and [[Reductionism#Reductionism and science|reductionism]].&lt;ref name="Plotkin, Henry p.150"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Lancaster 2003"/&gt;&lt;ref name=Hamilton/&gt;&lt;ref name=ehrlichfeldman/&gt;&lt;ref name="Lickliter&amp;Honeycutt1"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Lickliter |first1=Robert |last2=Honeycutt |first2=Hunter |year=2003 |title=Developmental Dynamics: Toward a Biologically Plausible Evolutionary Psychology |journal=[[Psychological Bulletin]] |volume=129 |issue=6 |pages=819–835 |publisher=American Psychological Association |doi=10.1037/0033-2909.129.6.819 |url=http://academic.brooklyn.cuny.edu/biology/jbasil/documents/PaulCurtainPaper.pdf |accessdate=March 25, 2013 |pmid=14599279}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Maiers |first1=Wolfgang |authorlink1=|authorlink2=|editor1-first=John R. |editor1-last=Morss |editor1-link=|editor2-first=Niamh |editor2-last=Stephenson |editor3-first=Hans |editor3-last=van Rappard |title=Theoretical Issues in Psychology |url=|year=2001 |publisher=Kluwer Academic |location=Boston |isbn=978-0-7923-7337-7 |page=281 |pages=|chapter=Psychological Theorising in Transdisciplinary Perspective |chapterurl=https://books.google.com/books?id=lBJ1A1BX5uIC&amp;pg=PA281}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Evolutionary psychology is based on the theory that human [[physiology]] and [[psychology]] are influenced by [[gene]]s. Evolutionary psychologists assume that genes contain instructions for building and operating an organism and that these instructions are passed from one generation to the next via genes.&lt;ref name="Lickliter&amp;Honeycutt1"/&gt;

Lickliter and Honeycutt (2003) have argued that evolutionary psychology is a predeterministic and [[Preformationism|preformationistic]] approach that assumes that physical and psychological traits are predetermined and programmed while virtually ignoring non-genetic factors involved in human development. Even when evolutionary psychologists acknowledge the influence of the environment, they reduce its role to that of an activator or trigger of the predetermined developmental instructions presumed to be encoded in a person's genes. Lickliter and Honeycutt have stated that the assumption of genetic determinism is most evident in the theory that learning and reasoning are governed by innate, domain-specific modules. Evolutionary psychologists assume that modules preexist individual development and lie dormant in the structure of the organism, awaiting activation by some (usually unspecified) experiential events. Lickliter and Honeycutt have opposed this view and suggested that it is the entire developmental system, including the specific features of the environment a person actually encounters and interacts with (and not the environments of distant ancestors) that brings about any modularity of cognitive function.&lt;ref name="Lickliter&amp;Honeycutt1"/&gt;

Critics argue that a reductionist analysis of the relationship between genes and behavior results in a flawed research program and a restricted interpretation of the evidence, creating problems for the creation of models attempting to explain behavior. Lewontin, Rose &amp; Kamin instead advocate a [[dialectical]] interpretation of behavior in which "it is not just that wholes are more than the sum of their parts, it is that parts become qualitatively new by being parts of the whole". They argue that reductionist explanations such as the hierarchical reductionism proposed by [[Richard Dawkins]] will cause the researcher to miss dialectical ones.&lt;ref name="Lewontin, R.C. 1984"/&gt; Similarly, [[Hilary Rose (sociologist)|Hilary Rose]] criticizes evolutionary psychologists' explanations of [[child abuse]] as excessively reductionist. As an example she cites [[Martin Daly]] and Margot Wilson's theory that stepfathers are more abusive because they lack the nurturing instinct of natural parents and can increase their reproductive success in this way. According to Rose this does not explain why most stepfathers do not abuse their children and why some biological fathers do. She also argues that cultural pressures can override the genetic predisposition to nurture as in the case of sex-selective [[infanticide]] prevalent in some cultures where male offspring are favored over female offspring.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Rose |first1=Hilary |authorlink1=|authorlink2=|editor1-first=Steven |editor1-last=Rose |editor1-link=|editor2-first=Hilary |editor2-last=Rose |title=Alas, Poor Darwin: Arguments against Evolutionary Psychology |url=|year=200 |publisher=Harmony Books |location=New York |isbn=978-0-609-60513-4 |page=|pages=127–53 |chapter=Colonizing the Social Sciences? |chapterurl=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Evolutionary psychologists Workman and Reader reply that while reductionism may be a "dirty word" to some it is actually an important scientific principle. They argue it is at the root of discoveries such as the world being made up of atoms and complex life being the result of evolution. At the same time they emphasize that it is important to look at all "levels" of explanations, e.g. both psychologists looking at environmental causes of depression and neuroscientists looking the brain contribute to different aspects of our knowledge of depression. Workman and Reader also deny the accusation of genetic determinism, asserting that genes usually do not cause behaviors absolutely but predispose to certain behaviors that are affected by factors such as culture and an individual's life history.&lt;ref&gt;Evolutionary psychology: an introduction, Lance Workman, Will Reader, Cambridge University Press; 2004, p25-26&lt;/ref&gt;

== Alternative explanations ==

=== Adaptive explanations vs. environmental, cultural, social, and dialectical explanations ===
A common critique is that evolutionary psychology does not address the complexity of individual development and experience and fails to explain the influence of genes on behavior in individual cases.&lt;ref name="EBO instinct"&gt;"instinct." Encyclopædia Britannica. Encyclopædia Britannica Online. Encyclopædia Britannica, 2011. Web. 09 Feb. 2011. [http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/289249/instinct].&lt;/ref&gt;

Critics assert that evolutionary psychology has trouble developing research that can distinguish between environmental and cultural explanation and adaptive evolutionary explanations. Some studies have been criticized for their tendency to attribute to evolutionary processes elements of human cognition that may be attributable to social processes (e.g. preference for particular physical features in mates), cultural artifacts (e.g. patriarchy and the roles of women in society), or dialectical considerations (e.g. behaviours in which biology interacts with society, as when a biologically determined skin colour determines how one is treated). Evolutionary psychologists are frequently criticized for ignoring the vast bodies of literature in psychology, philosophy, politics and social studies. Both sides of the debate stress that statements such as "biology vs. environment" and "genes vs. culture" amount to [[false dichotomy|false dichotomies]], and outspoken critics of [[sociobiology]] such as [[Richard Lewontin]], Steven Rose and [[Leon Kamin]] helped to popularise a "dialectical" approach to questions of human behaviour, where biology and environment interact in complex ways to produce what we see.&lt;ref&gt;Lewontin, Rose &amp; Kamin (1984) "Biology, Ideology and Human Nature: Not In Our Genes", Chapter 10&lt;/ref&gt;

Evolutionary psychologists respond that their discipline is not primarily concerned with explaining the behavior of specific individuals, but rather broad categories of human behaviors across societies and cultures. It is the search for species-wide psychological adaptations (or "human nature") that distinguishes evolutionary psychology from purely cultural or social explanations. These psychological adaptations include cognitive decision rules that respond to different environmental, cultural, and social circumstances in ways that are (on average) adaptive.{{Citation needed|date=July 2011}}

Evolutionary psychologists Confer et al. argue that evolutionary psychology fully accepts nature-nurture interactionism, and that it is possible to test the theories in order to distinguish between different explanations.&lt;ref name=AmPs2010/&gt;

=== Adaptive explanations vs. other evolutionary mechanisms ===

Critics point out that within evolutionary biology there are many other non-adaptive pathways along which evolution can move to produce the behaviors seen in humans today. Natural selection is not the only evolutionary process that can change gene frequencies and produce novel traits. [[Genetic drift]] is caused by chance variation in the genes, environment, or development. Evolutionary by-products are traits that were not specially designed for an adaptive function, although they may also be species-typical and may also confer benefits on the organism. A "[[spandrel (biology)|spandrel]]" is a term coined by [[Stephen Jay Gould|Gould]] and Lewontin (1979a) for traits which confer no adaptive advantage to an organism, but are 'carried along' by an adaptive trait. Gould advocates the hypothesis that cognition in humans came about as a spandrel: "Natural selection made the human brain big, but most of our mental properties and potentials may be spandrels – that is, nonadaptive side consequences of building a device with such structural complexity".&lt;ref&gt;Quote from Stephen Jay Gould, ''The Pleasures of Pluralism'', p.11&lt;/ref&gt; Once a trait acquired by some other mechanism confers an adaptive advantage, it may be open to further selection as an "[[exaptation]]".&lt;ref name="Gould1982"&gt;{{cite journal | last1=Gould | first1=S. J. | last2=Vrba | first2=E. S. | year=1982 | title=Exaptation - a missing term in the science of form | journal=Paleobiology | volume=8 | issue=1 | pages=4–15 | jstor=2400563 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Evolutionary psychologists suggest that critics misrepresent their field, and that their empirical research is designed to help identify which psychological traits are prone to adaptations, and which are not.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |journal=American Psychologist |year=1998 |volume=53 |number=5 |pages=533–548 |title=Adaptations, Exaptations, and Spandrels |last1=Buss |first1=David M. |last2=Haselton |first2=Martie G. |last3=Shackleford |first3=Todd K. |last4=Bleske |first4=April L. |last5=Wakefield |first5=Jerome C.|url=http://www.sscnet.ucla.edu/comm/haselton/webdocs/spandrels.html |doi=10.1037/0003-066x.53.5.533 |pmid=9612136}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Disjunction and grain problems ===
Some have argued that even if the theoretical assumptions of evolutionary psychology turned out to be true, it would nonetheless lead to methodological problems that would compromise its practice.&lt;ref name=Bradley2005&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Franks | first1 = Bradley | year = 2005 | title = The Role of 'The Environment' in Cognitive and Evolutionary Psychology | url = | journal = Philosophical Psychology | volume = 18 | issue = 1| pages = 59–82 | doi=10.1080/09515080500085387}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=richardson/&gt; The disjunction and grain problems are argued to create methodological challenges related to the indeterminacy of evolutionary psychology’s adaptive functions. That is, the inability to correctly choose, from a number of possible answers to the question: "what is the function of a given mechanism?"&lt;ref name=Bradley2005/&gt;

The ''disjunction problem''&lt;ref name=Bradley2005/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Fodor, Jerry (1991). Reply to Millikan. In B. Loewer &amp; G. Rey (Eds.), Meaning in mind. Fodor and his critic. Oxford, England: Blackwell.&lt;/ref&gt; occurs when a mechanism appears to respond to one thing (''F''), but is also correlated with another (''G''). Whenever ''F'' is present, ''G'' is also present, and the mechanism seems to respond to both ''F'' and ''G''. The difficulty thus involves deciding whether to characterize the mechanism's adaptive function as being related to ''F'', ''G'', or ''both''. "For example, a frogs pre-catching mechanism responds to flies, bees, food pellets, etc.; so is its adaptation attuned to flies, bees, fleebees, pellets, all of these, or just some?"&lt;ref name=Bradley2005/&gt;

The ''grain problem''&lt;ref name=Bradley2005/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Sterelny, K., &amp; Griffiths, P. E. (1999). Sex and death: An Introduction to Philosophy of Biology. London: University of Chicago Press.&lt;/ref&gt; refers to the challenge in knowing what kind of environmental 'problem' an adaptive mental mechanism might have solved. As summarized by Sterenly &amp; Griffiths (1999): "What are the problems 'out there' in the environment? Is the problem of mate choice a single problem or a mosaic of many distinct problems? These problems might include: When should I be unfaithful to my usual partner? When should I desert my old partner? When should I help my sibs find a partner? When and how should I punish infidelity?"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Sterelny | first1 = K. | last2 = Griffiths | first2 = P. E. | year = 1999 | title = Sex and death: An Introduction to Philosophy of Biology. In B. Franks, The Role of 'The Environment' in Cognitive and Evolutionary Psychology | url = | journal = Philosophical Psychology | volume = 18 | issue = 1| page = 66 | doi=10.1080/09515080500085387}}&lt;/ref&gt; The grain problem therefore refers to the possibility that an adaptive problem may actually involve a set of nested 'sub-problems' "which may themselves relate to different input domains or situations. Franks states that "if both adaptive problems and adaptive solutions are indeterminate, what chance is there for evolutionary psychology?"&lt;ref name=Bradley2005/&gt;

Franks also states that "The arguments in no sense count against a general evolutionary explanation of psychology." and that by relaxing assumptions the problems may be avoided, although this may reduce the ability to make detailed models.&lt;ref name=Bradley2005/&gt;

== Behaviors that reduce reproductive success ==
"Maladaptive" behaviors such as [[homosexuality]] and [[suicide]] seem to reduce reproductive success and pose a challenge for evolutionary psychology. Evolutionary psychologists have proposed explanations, such that there may be higher fertility rates for the female relatives of homosexual men, thus progressing a potential homosexual gene,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Ciani | first1 = A. S. C. | last2 = Fontanesi | first2 = L. | last3 = Iemmola | first3 = F. | last4 = Giannella | first4 = E. | last5 = Ferron | last6 = Lombardo | first6 = L. | year = 2012 | title = Factors Associated with Higher Fecundity in Female Maternal Relatives of Homosexual Men | url = | journal = Journal of Sexual Medicine | volume = 9 | issue = 11| pages = 2878–2887 | doi = 10.1111/j.17436109.2012.02785.x }}&lt;/ref&gt; or that they may be byproducts of adaptive behaviors that usually increase reproductive success. However, a review by Confer et al. states that they "remain at least somewhat inexplicable on the basis of current evolutionary psychological accounts".&lt;ref name=AmPs2010/&gt; If seen to be of a maladaptive nature, and therefore disregarding the evolutionary psychological evidence for things such as homosexuality, these behaviours can simply be seen in a no different manner than other maladaptations such as poor eyesight.

== Ethical implications ==
{{see also|Evolutionary ethics}}

Many critics have argued that evolutionary psychology and sociobiology justify existing social hierarchies and [[reactionary]] policies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Rose |first1=Hilary |last2=Rose |first2=Steven |editor1-link=|others=|title=Alas, Poor Darwin: Arguments against Evolutionary Psychology |url=|edition=|year=2000 |publisher=Harmony Books |location=New York |isbn=978-0-609-60513-4 |page=|pages=1–13 |chapter=Introduction |chapterurl=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="wilson2003"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Wilson |first1=David Sloan |last2=Dietrich |first2=Eric |last3=Clark |first3=Anne B. |year=2003 |title=On the inappropriate use of the naturalistic fallacy in evolutionary psychology |journal=Biology and Philosophy |volume=18 |issue=5 |pages=669–81 |publisher=|doi=10.1023/A:1026380825208 |url=http://evolution.binghamton.edu/dswilson/wp-content/uploads/2010/01/DSW14.pdf |accessdate=March 23, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Evolutionary psychologists have been accused of conflating [[Is–ought problem|"is" and "ought"]], and evolutionary psychology has been used to argue against social change (because the way things are now has been evolved and adapted) and against social justice (e.g. the argument that the rich are only rich because they've inherited greater abilities, so programs to raise the standards of the poor are doomed to fail).&lt;ref name="Lewontin, R.C. 1984"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Lewontin |first1=Richard C. |authorlink1=Richard Lewontin |last2=Rose |first2=Steven P.

It has also been suggested by critics that evolutionary psychologists' theories and interpretations of empirical data rely heavily on [[Ideology|ideological]] assumptions about race and gender.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Caporael |first1=Linnda R. |last2=Brewer |first2=Marilynn B. |year=1991 |title=The Quest for Human Nature: Social and Scientific Issues in Evolutionary Psychology |journal=Journal of Social Issues |volume=47 |issue=3 |pages=1–9 |publisher=|doi=10.1111/j.1540-4560.1991.tb01819.x |url=|accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Halford Fairchild]], for example, argues that [[J. Philippe Rushton]]'s work on [[race and intelligence]] was influenced by preconceived notions about race and was "cloaked in the nomenclature, language and 'objectivity'" of evolutionary psychology, sociobiology and population genetics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Fairchild |first1=Halford H. |year=1991 |title=Scientific Racism: The Cloak of Objectivity |journal=Journal of Social Issues |volume=47 |issue=3 |pages=101–115 |doi=10.1111/j.1540-4560.1991.tb01825.x |url=http://bernard.pitzer.edu/~hfairchi/pdf/ScientificRacism.pdf |accessdate=March 23, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Moreover, evolutionary psychology has been criticized for its ethical implications. Richardon (2007) and Wilson et al. (2003) have cited the theories in ''[[A Natural History of Rape]]'' where [[rape]] is described as a form of [[mate choice]] that enhances male [[Fitness (biology)|fitness]] as examples.&lt;ref name="wilson2003"/&gt;&lt;ref name=richardson/&gt; Critics have expressed concern over the moral consequences of such evolutionary theories and some critics have understood them to justify rape.&lt;ref name="wilson2003"/&gt;&lt;ref name=richardson&gt;{{cite book |last1=Richardson |first1=Robert C. |authorlink1=|authorlink2=|editor1-link=|others=|title=Evolutionary Psychology As Maladapted Psychology |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=KeqiKNFa3YgC&amp;pg=PA36 |edition=|year=2007 |publisher=[[MIT Press]] |location=Cambridge, Mass. |isbn=978-0-262-18260-7 |page=36 |pages=|chapter=|chapterurl=}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, empirical research has found that, compared to a control group, exposure to evolutionary psychology theories had no observable impact on male judgments of men’s criminal sexual behavior.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Dar-Nimrod | first1 = I. | last2 = Ilan | first2 = D. | last3 = Heine | first3 = S.

Evolutionary psychologists caution against committing the [[naturalistic fallacy]] – the idea that "ought can be derived from is" and that "what is natural" is necessarily a moral good.&lt;ref name="wilson2003"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Levy"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Levy |first1=Neil |year=2004 |title=Evolutionary Psychology, Human Universals, and the Standard Social Science Model |journal=[[Biology and Philosophy]] |volume=19 |issue=3 |pages=459–72|publisher=[[Kluwer Academic Publishers]] |doi=10.1023/B:BIPH.0000036111.64561.63 |citeseerx=10.1.1.90.9290 |accessdate=&lt;!-- March 18, 2013 --&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the book ''[[The Blank Slate]]'', Steven Pinker contends that critics have committed two logical fallacies: &lt;blockquote&gt;The [[naturalistic fallacy]] is the idea that what is found in nature is good. It was the basis for Social Darwinism, the belief that helping the poor and sick would get in the way of evolution, which depends on the survival of the fittest. Today, biologists denounce the Naturalistic Fallacy because they want to describe the natural world honestly, without people deriving morals about how we ought to behave -- as in: If birds and beasts engage in adultery, infanticide, cannibalism, it must be OK. The [[moralistic fallacy]] is that what is good is found in nature. It lies behind the bad science in nature-documentary voiceovers: lions are mercy-killers of the weak and sick, mice feel no pain when cats eat them, dung beetles recycle dung to benefit the ecosystem and so on. It also lies behind the romantic belief that humans cannot harbor desires to kill, rape, lie, or steal because that would be too depressing or reactionary.&lt;ref&gt;Q&amp;A: Steven Pinker of 'Blank Slate', United Press International, 10/30/2002, http://pinker.wjh.harvard.edu/books/tbs/media_articles/2002_10_30_upi.html&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Similarly, the authors of ''A Natural History of Rape'', Thornhill and Palmer, as well as McKibbin et al. respond to allegations that evolutionary psychologists legitimizes rape by arguing that their critics' reasoning is a naturalistic fallacy in the same way it would be a fallacy to accuse the scientists doing research on the causes of [[cancer]] of justifying cancer. Instead, they argue that understanding the causes of rape may help create preventive measures.&lt;ref name="wilson2003"/&gt;&lt;ref name=McKibbin&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = McKibbin | first1 = W. F. | last2 = Shackelford | first2 = T. K. | last3 = Goetz | first3 = A. T. | last4 = Starratt | first4 = V. G. | title = Why do men rape?

Wilson et al. (2003) have stated that evolutionary psychologists are themselves confused about the naturalistic fallacy and misuse it to forestall legitimate ethical discussions. The authors have argued that a factual statement must be combined with an ethical statement to derive an ethical conclusion. Thus, "ought" cannot be described ''exclusively'' from "is". They have suggested that if one combines Thornhill and Palmer's theory that rape increases the fitness of a woman's offspring with the ethical premise that it is right to increase fitness of offspring, the resulting deductively valid conclusion is that rape has also positive effects and that its ethical status is ambiguous. Wilson et al. have stated: "Any critic who objects to Thornhill and Palmer's evolutionary interpretation of rape on ethical grounds is dismissed with the phrase 'naturalistic fallacy' like a child stupid enough to write 2+2=5, stifling any meaningful discussion of the ethical issues surrounding the subject of rape. Yet, it is Thornhill and Palmer who are thinking fallaciously by using the naturalistic fallacy in this way." However, in the same article these authors also note that "...we want to stress that we are sympathetic with the goals of evolutionary psychology and think that research should proceed on all fronts, including the possibility that unethical behaviors such as rape evolved by natural selection".&lt;ref name="wilson2003"/&gt;

== Political stance ==

Part of the controversy has consisted in each side accusing the other of holding or supporting extreme political viewpoints: evolutionary psychology has often been accused of supporting right-wing politics, whereas critics have been accused of being motivated by [[Marxism|Marxist]] view points.&lt;ref name="Plotkin, Henry p.149"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Segerstråle, Ullica Christina Olofsdotter |title=Defenders of the truth : the battle for science in the sociobiology debate and beyond |publisher=Oxford University Press |location=Oxford |year=2000 |pages=|isbn=0-19-850505-1 |oclc=|doi=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Linguist and activist [[Noam Chomsky]] has said that evolutionary psychologists often ignore evidence that might harm the political status quo:

{{quote|The founder of what is now called "sociobiology" or "evolutionary psychology"-the natural historian and anarchist [[Peter Kropotkin]]-concluded from his investigations of animals and human life and society that "mutual aid" was a primary factor in evolution, which tended naturally toward [[Anarchist communism|communist anarchism]]....Of course, Kropotkin is not considered the founding figure of the field and is usually dismissed if mentioned at all, because his quasi-Darwinian speculations led to unwanted conclusions.&lt;ref name="ChomskyBook"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Bricmont|first1=Jean|last2=Franck|first2=Julie|year=2010|title=Chomsky Notebook}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Chomsky has also said that not enough is known about human nature to point to any political conclusions.&lt;ref name="ChomskyBook"/&gt;

Evolutionary psychologist [[Glenn Wilson (psychologist)|Glenn Wilson]] argues that "promoting recognition of the true power and role of instincts is not the same as advocating the total abandonment of social restraint".&lt;ref&gt;Wilson, G.D. Love and Instinct, 1981.&lt;/ref&gt; Left-wing philosopher [[Peter Singer]] in his book ''[[A Darwinian Left]]'' has argued that the view of human nature provided by evolution is compatible with and should be incorporated into the ideological framework of the Left.

Evolutionary psychology critics have argued that researchers use their research to promote a right-wing agenda. Evolutionary psychologists conducted a 2007 study investigating the views of a sample of 168 United States [[PhD]] psychology students. The authors concluded that those who self-identified as [[Adaptationism|adaptationists]] were much less conservative than the general population average. They also found no differences compared to non-adaptationist students and found non-adaptationists to express a preference for less strict and quantitative scientific methodology than adaptationists.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Tybur | first1 = J.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10584">'''Dual process theory''' is an influential theory of human [[moral judgment]] that alleges that human beings possess emotion-based and rationally-based cognitive subsystems that compete in [[moral reasoning]] processes. Initially proposed by [[Joshua Greene (psychologist)|Joshua Greene]] along with Brian Sommerville, Leigh Nystrom, [[John M. Darley|John Darley]], Jonathan Cohen and others,&lt;ref&gt;Greene, J. D., Sommerville, R. B., Nystrom, L. E., Darley, J. M., &amp; Cohen, J. D. (2001). An fMRI investigation of emotional engagement in moral judgment. Science, 293(5537), 2105–8.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Greene, J. D., Nystrom, L. E., Engell, A. D., Darley, J. M., &amp; Cohen, J. D. (2004). The neural bases of cognitive conflict and control in moral judgment. Neuron, 44(2), 389–400.&lt;/ref&gt; the theory can be seen as a domain specific example of more general [[Dual process theory|dual process accounts]] in [[psychology]].

==Assertions and influence==
The dual process account asserts that human beings have two separate methods for moral reasoning. The first refers to intuitive or instinctual responses to moral violations.  These responses are implicit and the factors affecting them may be consciously inaccessible.&lt;ref&gt;Cushman, F.; Young, L.; Hauser, M. (2006). The Role of Conscious Reasoning and Intuition in Moral Judgment Testing Three Principles of Harm. Psychological Science, 17(12), 1082–1089.&lt;/ref&gt;  Greene asserts that these responses are supported by emotional activation.  The second method refers to conscious, controlled reasoning processes.  These processes ignore the emotional aspects of decision making, instead focusing on maximizing gain or obtaining the most desirable overall outcome.  In everyday decision making, most decisions use one or other system, but in moral dilemmas in which an individual must compromise between violating moral rules and maximizing overall good, the systems come into conflict.

Greene ties the two processes to theories of [[ethics]] existing in moral philosophy, specifically [[consequentialism]] and [[deontological ethics]].&lt;ref&gt;Greene, J. D. (2008). The secret joke of Kant’s soul. In Sinnott-Armstrong (Ed.), Moral Psychology: Volume 3 (pp. 35–80). Cambridge: MIT University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; He argues that the existing tension between systems of ethics that focus on "right action" and those that focus on "best results" can be explained by the existence of the proposed dueling systems in individual human minds.

This theory of moral judgment has had influence on research in moral psychology. The original fMRI investigation&lt;ref&gt;Greene, J. D., Sommerville, R. B., Nystrom, L. E., Darley, J. M., &amp; Cohen, J. D. (2001). An fMRI investigation of emotional engagement in moral judgment. Science, 293(5537), 2105–8.&lt;/ref&gt; proposing the dual process account has been cited in excess of 2000 scholarly articles, generating extensive use of similar methodology as well as criticism. An alternative formulation of dual process theory in moral psychology may be found in.&lt;ref&gt;Sun, R. (2013). Moral judgment, human motivation, and neural networks. Cognitive Computation, 5(4), 566-579&lt;/ref&gt;

==Evidence==
The dual process account first grew out of [[functional magnetic resonance imaging|fMRI]] experiments showing that moral dilemmas such as the [[trolley problem]] engaged areas of the brain corresponding to emotional processing when the context involved "personal" moral violations (such as direct bodily force).  When the context of the dilemma was more "impersonal" (the decision maker pulls a switch rather than use bodily force) areas corresponding to working memory and controlled reasoning were engaged instead.&lt;ref&gt;Greene, J. D., Sommerville, R. B., Nystrom, L. E., Darley, J. M., &amp; Cohen, J. D. (2001). An fMRI investigation of emotional engagement in moral judgment. Science, 293(5537), 2105–8.&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Neuropsychology|Neuropsychological]] evidence from [[Lesion|lesion studies]] focusing on patients with damage to the [[ventromedial prefrontal cortex]] also points to a possible dissociation between emotional and rational decision processes.  Damage to this area is typically associated with antisocial personality traits and impairments of moral decision making.&lt;ref&gt;Aaron D Boes et al (2011). "Behavioral effects of congenital ventromedial prefrontal cortex malformation". BMC Neurology 11 (151).&lt;/ref&gt;  Patients with these lesions tend to show more frequent endorsement of the "utilitarian" path in trolley problem dilemmas.&lt;ref&gt;Koenigs, M., Young, L., Adolphs, R., Tranel, D., Cushman, F., Hauser, M., &amp; Damasio, A. (2007). Damage to prefrontal cortex increases utilitarian moral judgments. Nature, 446(7138), 908–911.&lt;/ref&gt;  Greene et al. claim that this shows that when emotional information is removed through context or damage to brain regions necessary to render such information, the process associated with rational, controlled reasoning dominates decision making.&lt;ref&gt;Greene, J. D. (2007). Why are VMPFC patients more utilitarian? A dual-process theory of moral judgment explains. Trends in Cognitive Sciences, 11(8), 322–3; author reply 323–4.&lt;/ref&gt;

Another critical piece of evidence supporting the dual process account comes from reaction time data associated with moral dilemma experiments. Subjects who choose the "utilitarian" path in moral dilemmas showed increased reaction times under high [[cognitive load]] in "personal" dilemmas, while those choosing the "deontological" path remained unaffected.&lt;ref&gt;Greene, J. D., Morelli, S. a, Lowenberg, K., Nystrom, L. E., &amp; Cohen, J. D. (2008). Cognitive load selectively interferes with utilitarian moral judgment. Cognition, 107(3), 1144–54.&lt;/ref&gt; Cognitive load in general is also found to increase the likelihood "deontological" judgment.&lt;ref&gt;Trémolière, B., Neys, W. De, &amp; Bonnefon, J.-F. (2012). Mortality salience and morality: thinking about death makes people less utilitarian. Cognition, 124(3), 379–84.&lt;/ref&gt; These laboratory findings are supplemented by work that looks at the decision-making processes of real world altruists in life-or-death situations.&lt;ref&gt;Rand, David G., and Ziv G. Epstein. [http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0109687 "Risking your life without a second thought: Intuitive decision-making and extreme altruism."] PLoS ONE 9.10 (2014): e109687.&lt;/ref&gt; These heroes overwhelming described their actions as fast and intuitive, and virtually never as carefully reasoned.

==Criticisms==
Several criticisms have been leveled against the dual process account. The most common criticism asserts that the dual emotional/rational model ignores the motivational aspect of decision making in human social contexts &lt;ref&gt;Moll, J., De Oliveira-Souza, R., &amp; Zahn, R.

Moral Judgement, Human Motivation, and Neural Networks. Cognitive Computation&lt;/ref&gt; A more specific example of this criticism focuses on the ventromedial prefrontal cortex lesion data. Although patients with this damage display characteristically "cold-blooded" behavior in the trolley problem, they show more likelihood of endorsement of emotionally laden choices in the [[Ultimatum Game]].&lt;ref&gt;Koenigs, M., &amp; Tranel, D. (2007). Irrational economic decision-making after ventromedial prefrontal damage: evidence from the Ultimatum Game. The Journal of Neuroscience, 27(4), 951–6.&lt;/ref&gt;  It is argued that moral decisions are better understood as integrating emotional, rational, and motivational information, the last of which has been shown to involve areas of the brain in the limbic system and brain stem.&lt;ref&gt;Moll, J., &amp; de Oliveira-Souza, R. (2007). Response to Greene: Moral sentiments and reason: friends or foes? Trends in Cognitive Sciences, 2(3-4), 336–52.&lt;/ref&gt;

Other criticisms focus on the methodology of using moral dilemmas such as the trolley problem. These criticisms note the lack of affective realism in contrived moral dilemmas and their tendency to use the actions of strangers to offer a view of human moral sentiments. [[Paul Bloom (psychologist)|Paul Bloom]] in particular, argues that a multitude of attitudes towards the agents involved are important in evaluating an individual's moral stance, as well as evaluating the motivations that may inform those decisions.&lt;ref&gt;Bloom, P. (2011). Family, community, trolley problems, and the crisis in moral psychology. The Yale Review, 99(2), 26-43.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Thomas Nagel]] critiques it by suggesting that Joshua Greene, in his book ''Moral Tribes,'' is too quick to conclude utilitarianism specifically from the general goal of constructing an impartial morality; for example, he says, Kant and Rawls offer other impartial approaches to ethical questions.&lt;ref name=Nagel2013&gt;{{cite web|last=Nagel|first=Thomas|title=You Can't Learn About Morality from Brain Scans: The problem with moral psychology|url=https://newrepublic.com/article/115279/joshua-greenes-moral-tribes-reviewed-thomas-nagel|work=New Republic|accessdate=24 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Robert Wright (journalist)|Robert Wright]] calls&lt;ref name=Wright2013&gt;{{cite news|last=Wright|first=Robert|title=Why Can't We All Just Get Along? The Uncertain Biological Basis of Morality|url=https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2013/11/why-we-fightand-can-we-stop/309525/|accessdate=24 November 2013|newspaper=The Atlantic|date=23 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Joshua Greene's proposal for global harmony ambitious and adds, "I like ambition!" But he also claims that people have a tendency to see facts in a way that serves their ingroup, even if there's no disagreement about the underlying moral principles that govern the disputes. "If indeed we’re wired for tribalism," Wright explains, "then maybe much of the problem has less to do with differing moral visions than with the simple fact that my tribe is my tribe and your tribe is your tribe. Both Greene and [[Paul Bloom (psychologist)|Paul Bloom]] cite studies in which people were randomly divided into two groups and immediately favored members of their own group in allocating resources -- even when they knew the assignment was random." Instead, Wright proposes that "nourishing the seeds of enlightenment indigenous to the world’s tribes is a better bet than trying to convert all the tribes to utilitarianism -- both more likely to succeed, and more effective if it does."

'''Energy engineering''' or '''energy systems engineering''' is a broad field of [[engineering]] dealing with [[efficient energy use|energy efficiency]], [[energy services]], [[facility management]], plant engineering, [[environmental compliance]] and [[alternative energy]] technologies. Energy engineering is one of the more recent engineering disciplines to emerge. Energy engineering combines knowledge from the fields of [[physics]], [[math]], and [[chemistry]] with economic and environmental engineering practices. Energy engineers apply their skills to increase efficiency and further develop renewable sources of energy.
The main job of energy engineers is to find the most efficient and sustainable ways to operate buildings and manufacturing processes. Energy engineers audit the use of energy in those processes and suggest ways to improve the systems. This means suggesting advanced lighting, better insulation, more efficient heating and cooling properties of buildings.&lt;ref name=Berkeley&gt;Berkeley Engineering (2013).&lt;/ref&gt; Although an energy engineer is concerned about obtaining and using energy in the most environmentally friendly ways, their field is not limited to strictly renewable energy like hydro, solar, biomass, or geothermal. Energy engineers are also employed by the fields of oil and natural gas extraction.&lt;ref name=Berkeley/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;AGCAS editors (2011).&lt;/ref&gt;

==Purpose==
Energy minimization is the purpose of this growing discipline. Often applied to building design, heavy consideration is given to [[HVAC]], [[lighting]], [[refrigeration]], to both reduce energy loads and increase [[efficiency]] of current systems. Energy engineering is increasingly seen as a major step forward in meeting [[Carbon neutrality|carbon reduction targets]]. Since buildings and houses consume over 40% of the United States energy, the services an energy engineer performs are in demand.&lt;ref&gt;Science Buddies (2013).&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Human beings have been transferring [[energy]] from one form to another since their use of fire. The efficiency of the transfer of energy is a new field. The [[1973 oil crisis|oil crisis of 1973]] and [[1979 energy crisis|energy crisis of 1979]] brought to light the need to get more work out of less energy. The [[United States]] government passed several laws in the seventies to promote increased [[Efficient energy use|energy efficiency]], such as United States public law 94-413, the [[Federal Clean Car Incentive Program]].&lt;ref&gt;Berman (2011).&lt;/ref&gt;

==Power engineering==
Considered a subdivision of energy engineering, [[power engineering]] applies math and physics to the movement and transfer of energy to work in a system.

==Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design==
[[Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design]] (LEED) is a program created by the [[United States Green Building Council]] (USGBC) in March 2000. LEED is a program that encourages green building and promotes sustainability in the construction of buildings and the efficiency of the utilities in the buildings.

In 2012 the United States Green Building Council asked the independent firm [[Booz Allen Hamilton]] to conduct a study on the effectiveness of LEED program. "This study confirmed that green buildings generate substantial energy savings. From 2000–2008, green construction and renovation generated $1.3 billion in energy savings. Of that $1.3 billion, LEED-certified buildings accounted for $281 million." The study also found the summation of all green construction supported 2.4 million jobs.&lt;ref&gt;Booz Allen Hamilton (2012).&lt;/ref&gt;

==Energy efficiency==
[[Energy efficiency (physics)|Energy efficiency]] is seen two ways. The first view is that more work is done from the same amount of energy used. The other perception is that the same amount of work is accomplished with less energy used in the system.&lt;ref&gt;Battles and Burns (1999).&lt;/ref&gt; Some ways to get more work out of less energy is to "Reduce, Reuse, and Recycle" the materials used in daily life. The advancement of technology has led to other uses of waste. Technology such as [[waste-to-energy]] facilities which convert solid wastes through the process of [[gasification]] or [[pyrolysis]] to liquid fuels to be burned. The [[Environmental Protection Agency]] stated that the United States produced 250 million tons of municipal waste in 2010. Of that 250 million tons roughly 54% gets thrown in land fills, 33% is recycled, and 13% goes to [[energy recovery]] plants.&lt;ref name=Crawford_2013&gt;Crawford (2013).&lt;/ref&gt; In European countries who pay more for fuel, such as Denmark where the price for a gallon of gas neared $10 in 2010, have more fully developed waste-to energy facilities.&lt;ref&gt;Thompson (2011).&lt;/ref&gt; In 2010 Denmark sent 7% of waste to landfills, 69% was recycled, and 24% was sent to waste-to-energy facilities. There are several other developed Western European countries that also have taken energy engineering into consideration.&lt;ref name=Crawford_2013/&gt; [[Germany]]'s "[[Energiewende]]", a policy which set the goal by 2050 to meet 80% of electrical needs from renewable energy sources.&lt;ref&gt;Baake and Morgan (2013).&lt;/ref&gt;

==Statistics==
The median yearly salary for an energy engineer is $64,587 U.S. dollars. 83% of energy engineers are male while the remaining 17% are female. 65% of energy engineers have less than five years of experience in their profession.&lt;ref&gt;PayScale (June 12, 2013).&lt;/ref&gt;

==Professional organizations==
Energy engineers have one main professional organization. The [[Association of Energy Engineers]] (AEE) founded in 1977. It now has 16,000 members in 89 countries. The organizations main responsibility is to lead energy certification programs to teach individuals across the world and certify as qualified to perform the job of an energy engineer.

==Education==

A bachelor’s degree is a primary requirement of becoming an energy engineer. Some energy engineers are registered [[Professional Engineer|Professional Engineers]] (P.E.); although the completion of that program is not a necessity. Of the 16,000 energy engineers that are in the [[Association of Energy Engineers]] (AEE), 58.4% have post-graduate degrees from accredited colleges. If the engineer is not a P.E. he or she would need a Certified Energy Manager (CEM) or Certified Energy Auditor (CEA) certificate from a group like the [[Association of Energy Engineers]] (AEE). Both CEM and CEA Certifications are recognized by the [[United States Department of Energy]]&lt;ref&gt;https://commonwealthengineers.com/cea-program-receives-recognition-from-department-of-energy/&lt;/ref&gt;

While a student who wants to become an energy engineer does not directly need to get a degree in energy engineering, several universities across the world have established departments or centers offering energy engineering degrees, to better prepare future engineers for their career. One of those programs is the IEP PEM Certification which is offered at [[Virginia Tech]] University.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.cpe.vt.edu/pemcert/&lt;/ref&gt; The Certified Professional Energy Manager (PEM) was created in conjunction by the Institute of Energy Professionals (IEP) and Energy University. Since 2009, Energy University has provided energy efficiency education to more than 130,000 professionals worldwide. The program offers more than 150 courses.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.energymanagertoday.com/energy-university-intros-online-energy-manager-certification-086994/&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Engineering Legends: Great American Civil Engineers''''' is a 2005 book by engineer [[Richard Weingardt]]. The book features a list of 32 engineering legends from the 1700s to the present, including [[Fazlur Khan]], [[Srinivasa 'Hal' Iyengar|Hal Iyengar]], [[Tung-Yen Lin]], [[Benjamin Wright]], and [[Fred Severud]].

Weingardt describes how the ingenuity of these engineers, many of whom were immigrants to the United States, revolutionized the world, and how people take so many things for granted which were made possible because of the genius of these engineers. The book discusses the fact that while the engineering achievements are regularly recognized, the engineers themselves are rarely discussed. These engineers should become common household names.

The book explores the personal lives and professional accomplishments of its subjects, providing an in-depth look at the people behind these achievements. The book also illustrates the diversity surrounding these engineers, such as their differing backgrounds, their reasons for becoming engineers, the obstacles they faced, and their work in different disciplines of civil engineering. In the foreword, [[Henry Petroski]] describes the book as a work that "cannot help but inspire engineers, future engineers, and all who benefit (and will continue to benefit) from their work".

'''''Heliophysics''''' is an aspect of '''''NASA science''''' that enables understanding the [[sun]], [[heliosphere]], and [[planetary environment]]s as a single connected system. In addition to [[sun|solar processes]], this domain of study includes the interaction of [[solar plasma]] and [[solar radiation]] with Earth, the other planets, and [[milky way galaxy|the galaxy]]. By analyzing the connections between the sun, [[solar wind]], planetary space environments, and human's place in the [[milky way galaxy]], the fundamental physical processes that occur throughout the universe are uncovered. Understanding the connections between the Sun and its planets will allow for predicting the impacts of solar interaction on humans, technological systems, and even the presence of life itself. This is also the stated goal of Science Mission Directorate's Heliophysics Research.&lt;ref name=helionasa&gt;

==Local effects==

Furthermore, ''[[heliophysics]]'' of ''NASA science'' views [[sun|the sun]] as an [[star| active star]], and that the earth is physically located within its [[solar atmosphere|atmosphere]]. This view also encompasses the interaction of the earth's [[geophysics|geophysical properties]] with this active star. For example, the sun' light influences all life and processes on Earth.  It is an energy provider that allows and sustains [[life]] on earth. However, the sun also produces streams of [[charged particles | high energy particles]] known as the [[solar wind]], and radiation that can harm life or alter its evolution. Additionally, under the protective shield of [[earth's magnetic field]] and its atmosphere, NASA science sees the Earth as an island in the universe where life has developed and flourished. The origins and fate of life on Earth are intimately connected to the sun's behavior. Hence, NASA science studies [[Heliophysics]] from this perspective.&lt;ref name=helionasa/&gt;&lt;ref name=pesnell&gt;{{cite journal

==Heliophysics research program==

[[Sun#History_of_observation|Methods have been developed]] to see into the internal workings of the sun and understand how the [[earth's magnetosphere]] responds to [[solar activity]]. Further studies are concerned with exploring the full system of complex interactions that characterize the relationship of the Sun with the [[solar system]]. According to NASA, understanding these connections is especially critical as we contemplate our destiny in the third millennium. Heliophysics is needed to facilitate the accelerated expansion of human experience beyond the confines of our earthly home. Recent advances in technology allow us, for the first time, to realistically contemplate voyages beyond the solar system.&lt;ref name=helionasa/&gt;&lt;ref name=pesnell/&gt;

There are three primary objectives that define the multi-decadal studies needed: &lt;ref name=helionasa/&gt;&lt;ref name=burch/&gt;

* To understand the changing flow of energy and matter throughout the Sun, Heliosphere, and Planetary Environments. 
* To explore the fundamental physical processes of space plasma systems. 
* To define the origins and societal impacts of variability in the Earth-Sun System. 
* A combination of interrelated elements is used to achieve these objectives. They include complementary missions of various sizes; timely development of enabling and enhancing technologies; and acquisition of knowledge through research, analysis, theory, and modeling.

== A variable star ==
Earth is located within the extended atmosphere of a [[magnetic]] [[variable star]] that drives the local [[solar system]] and sustains [[Life|life on Earth]]. The Sun is observed to vary from multiple perspectives. The Sun emits light in the [[infrared]], visible, [[ultraviolet]], and at x-ray energies, and it emits a [[magnetic field]], bulk plasma ([[solar wind|the solar wind]]) and energetic particles moving up to nearly the [[speed of light]], and all of these emissions vary.&lt;ref name=big-q-s/&gt;

The intertwined response of the earth and [[heliosphere]] are studied because this planet is immersed in this unseen yet exotic and inherently dangerous environment. Above the protective cocoon of Earth’s lower atmosphere is a plasma soup composed of electrified and magnetized matter entwined with penetrating radiation and energetic particles. The sun has an impact because modern society depends heavily on a variety of technologies that are susceptible to the extremes of [[space weather]] — severe disturbances of the upper atmosphere and of the near-Earth space environment that are driven by the magnetic activity of the Sun. Strong electrical currents driven in the Earth’s surface during auroral events can disrupt and damage modern electric power grids and may contribute to the corrosion of oil and gas pipelines. &lt;ref name=big-q-s&gt;

==Main focus==

Building on NASA’s rich history of exploration of Earth’s neighborhood and distant planetary systems, we are poised to provide a predictive understanding of our place in the solar system. We do not live in isolation; we are intimately coupled with the Sun and the space environment through Earth’s climate system, our technological systems, the habitability of planets and solar system bodies we plan to explore, and ultimately the fate of Earth itself. Variability in this environment affects the daily activities that constitute the underpinning of modern society, including communication, navigation, and weather monitoring and prediction. Because the space environment matters to humans and their technological systems both on Earth and in space, it is essential as a space-faring Nation that we develop an understanding of these space plasma processes. &lt;ref name=focus&gt;

|url=https://science.nasa.gov/heliophysics/focus-areas//}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

===Heliosphere===

Plasmas and their embedded magnetic fields affect the formation, evolution and destiny of planets and planetary systems. The heliosphere shields the solar system from galactic cosmic radiation. Our habitable planet is shielded by its [[magnetic field]], protecting it from solar and cosmic particle radiation and from erosion of the atmosphere by the solar wind. Planets without a shielding magnetic field, such as Mars and Venus, are exposed to those processes and evolve differently. And on Earth, the magnetic field changes strength and configuration during its occasional polarity reversals, altering the shielding of the planet from external radiation sources. &lt;ref name=focus/&gt;

===Magnetospheres===

Determine changes in the Earth's magnetosphere, ionosphere, and upper atmosphere in order to enable specification, prediction, and mitigation of their effects. Heliophysics seeks to develop an understanding of the response of the near-Earth plasma regions to space weather. This complex, highly coupled system protects Earth from the worst solar disturbances while redistributing energy and mass throughout. &lt;ref name=burch/&gt;&lt;ref name=focus/&gt;

===Space environment===

Understand the causes and subsequent evolution of solar activity that affects Earth's space climate and environment. The climate and space environment of Earth are significantly determined by the impact of plasma, particle, and radiative outputs from the Sun. Therefore, it is essential to understand the Sun, determine how predictable solar activity truly is, and develop the capability to forecast solar activity and the evolution of disturbances as they propagate to Earth. &lt;ref name=focus/&gt;

'''''Hiding in the Mirror''''' is a popular science book by the theoretical physicist [[Lawrence M. Krauss]]. The text was initially published on October 20, 2005 by [[Viking Press]]. This is his seventh non-fiction book.

==Synopsis==
The work draws on the works of scientists, mathematicians, artists, and writers to consider the cultural and scientific aspects of extra dimensions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author1=Andrew Zimmerman Jones|title=Hiding in the Mirror by Lawrence Krauss|url=http://physics.about.com/od/stringtheorybooks/gr/hidingmirror.htm|website=About.com|accessdate=18 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The book explores popular theories about such topics as [[black hole]]s, life in other [[dimension]]s, and [[string theory]].

==Review==
A reviewer of ''[[Publishers Weekly]]'' mentioned "Physicist Krauss offers an erudite and well-crafted overview of the role multiple dimensions have played in the history of physics. This isn't an easy book, even with a writer as talented as Krauss (whom some will recognize as the author of ''[[The Physics of Star Trek]]'' and ''[[Beyond Star Trek]]'') serving as one's Virgil. Long on science and short on its connections with culture, the book is essentially an introduction to the physics and mathematics of extra dimensions with a few more or less disconnected chapters that touch on how these ideas show up in art and popular culture; there's more on [[Brane world|brane-world]] and the [[ekpyrotic universe]] than on Plato's cave, whose inhabitants could not perceive reality in all its dimensions, or [[Buckaroo Banzai]]."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.publishersweekly.com/978-0-670-03395-9|title=Hiding in the Mirror: The Mysterious Allure of Extra Dimensions, from Plato to String Theory and Beyond -- Lawrence Krauss, Author|publisher=[[publishersweekly.com]]|accessdate=2015-07-06|}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4021">The '''INTEROP V-Lab''' (''International Virtual Laboratory for Enterprise Interoperability'') is a network of organizations, which links scientists, research centers, representatives of industry, and small and medium-sized enterprises. The members come from several European countries as well as China and represent 250 scientists and 70 organizations.

INTEROP-VLab was founded in 2007 and is the continuation of the INTEROP Network of Excellence (Interoperability research for networked enterprise applications and software), a research initiative of the [[European Union]] founded early 2000s,&lt;ref&gt;Panetto, Hervé, Monica Scannapieco, and Martin Zelm. "INTEROP NoE: interoperability research for networked enterprises applications and software." ''On the Move to Meaningful Internet Systems 2004: OTM 2004 Workshops.'' Springer Berlin Heidelberg, 2004.&lt;/ref&gt; which developed the [[Model Driven Interoperability#MDI Framework (INTEROP NoE)|Model Driven Interoperability (MDI) Framework]].

In 2012 [[Guy Doumeingts]] was appointed general manager of INTEROP-VLab.

== Overview ==
INTEROP-VLab is an initiative that is working within the context of [[interoperability]], in particular the so-called [[Enterprise Interoperability]] (EI). It aims to link together in a network researchers and research institutions and industry representatives, engaged in developing approaches and integrative solutions to connect heterogeneous industrial systems, public administrations or organizations.

The basic objective of INTEROP-VLab is the defragmentation of the European research and scientific landscape and support the cooperation of other regions of the world:
* through support of research, teaching and innovation in the field of Enterprise Interoperability
* through the work of a center of excellence in the field of Enterprise Interoperability world

== Activities ==
The activities of INTEROP-VLab consist of research, teaching and training services and standardization consultancy.

The independent research within INTEROP-VLabs is based on the following three key components:
* Information and communication technology as a technological foundation of interoperable systems
* Modeling of processes, organizations and organizational units to develop and implement appropriate structures for interoperable companies and public organizations
* The development and specification of ontologies to ensure semantic consistency within organizations affiliated with the following priorities:
** Theoretical groundwork
** Investigation and development of key technologies
** Development of exemplary applications

Within INTEROP-VLab developed solutions include:
* IV kmap (INTEROP-VLab Knowledge Map ), a competence management system within the EI range that is based on an ontology-based search engine and allows to find relevant documents and content relating to a particular knowledge domain.
* The IV e-learning platform, with 50 web-courses and seminars in the field of EI, modeling, ontologies offers and Architecture &amp; Platforms

== Members ==
The members of the INTEROP-VLab are organize in poles of geographic regions within a State or group of States. Activities of each organization are coordinated at European level. The members of the INTEROP-VLab are:
* INTEROP-VLab poles France Grand Sud-Ouest (PGSO)

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7683">'''Intellectual curiosity''' (also called epistemic curiosity) is curiosity that leads to an acquisition of [[general knowledge]]. It can include curiosity about such things as: what objects are composed of, the underlying mechanisms of systems, mathematical relationships, languages, social norms, and history. It can be differentiated from another type of curiosity that does not lead to acquisition of [[general knowledge]], such as curiosity about the intimate secrets of other people. It is a facet of [[openness to experience]] in the [[Five Factor Model]] used to describe human personalities.&lt;ref&gt;Costa, P. T. &amp; McCrae, R. R. (1992). ''NEO personality Inventory professional manual''. Odessa, FL: Psychological Assessment Resources.{{page needed|date=November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is similar to [[need for cognition]] and [[typical intellectual engagement]].

==History==
In antiquity,  the Roman philosopher [[Cicero]] wrote about our innate love of learning:
{{Quote|text=So great is our innate love of learning and of knowledge that no one can doubt that man’s nature is strongly attracted to these things even without the lure of any profit. For my part, I believe Homer had something of this sort in view in his imaginary account of the songs of the Sirens. Apparently it was not the sweetness of their voices or the novelty and diversity of their songs, but their professions of knowledge that used to attract the passing voyagers; it was the passion for learning that kept men rooted to the Sirens’ rocky shores. |author=Marcus Tullius Cicero |source=&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Rackham|first1=Marcus Tullius Cicero; with an English translation by H.|title=De finibus bonorum et malorum|date=2006|publisher=Harvard University Press|location=Cambridge, Mass.|isbn=9780674990449|page=48|edition=2nd}}&lt;/ref&gt; }}
In 1738, the Scottish philosopher [[David Hume]] differentiated intellectual curiosity from a more primitive form of curiosity: {{Quote|text=The same theory, that accounts for the love of truth in mathematics and algebra, may be extended to morals, politics, natural philosophy, and other studies, where we consider not the other abstract relations of ideas, but their real connexions and existence. But beside the love of knowledge, which displays itself in the sciences, there is a certain curiosity implanted in human nature, which is a passion derived from a quite different principle. Some people have an insatiable desire of knowing the actions and circumstances of their neighbours, though their interest be no way concerned in them, and they must entirely depend on others for their information; in which case there is no room for study or application. Let us search for the reason of this phenomenon.|author=David Hume|title=A treatise of human nature (p. 453)|source=&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Selby-Bigge |first1=David Hume. Ed. by L. A. |title=A treatise of human nature |date=1987 |publisher=Clarendon |location=Oxford |isbn=978-0-19-824588-9 |edition=2nd }}&lt;/ref&gt;}}
Later, in 1954, Berlyne differentiated it into perceptual curiosity and epistemic curiosity,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1111/j.2044-8295.1954.tb01243.x |pmid=13190171 |title=A Theory of Human Curiosity |journal=British Journal of Psychology. General Section |volume=45 |issue=3 |pages=180–91 |year=1954 |last1=Berlyne |first1=D. E }}&lt;/ref&gt; and in 2004 a psychometric scale to assess epistemic and perceptual curiosity was developed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1037/0022-0663.84.4.537 |title=Personality-intelligence relations: Assessment of typical intellectual engagement |journal=Journal of Educational Psychology |volume=84 |issue=4 |pages=537–52 |year=1992 |last1=Goff |first1=Maynard |last2=Ackerman |first2=Phillip L }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Intellectual development in children==
Humans seem to be born with intellectual curiosity, but depending on how parents react to questions from their children, intellectual curiosity might be increased or decreased.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Engel|first1=Susan|title=The Hungry Mind: The Origins of Curiosity in Childhood|publisher=Harvard University Press|isbn=978-0-674-73675-7|language=English}}{{page needed|date=January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Parents that always react negatively to questions asked by their children, are discouraging them from asking questions, and that is likely to make them less curious. On the other hand, parents that always react positively to questions asked by their children, are encouraging them to ask questions, and that is likely to make them more curious. There is a book about how to foster intellectual curiosity and a love for knowledge in children.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Swanson|first1=Kristen|last2=Krause|first2=Dianne|last3=Selak|first3=Bill|last4=Casas|first4=Jimmy|last5=Hasty|first5=Desmond|last6=Juliani|first6=A.

==Academic performance==
It has been positively correlated with academic performance (0.20), together with general intelligence (0.35) and conscientiousness (0.20).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1177/1745691611421204 |pmid=26168378 |title=The Hungry Mind |journal=Perspectives on Psychological Science |volume=6 |issue=6 |pages=574–88 |year=2011 |last1=von Stumm |first1=Sophie |last2=Hell |first2=Benedikt |last3=Chamorro-Premuzic |first3=Tomas }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Scientific progress==
Toby E. Huff has argued that the European civilization had a high level of intellectual curiosity during the scientific revolution.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Huff|first1=Toby E.|title=Intellectual curiosity and the scientific revolution a global perspective|date=2010|publisher=Cambridge University Press|location=Cambridge|isbn=978-0-521-17052-9|edition=1st}}{{page needed|date=January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; He also argues that other civilizations have had a high level of intellectual curiosity in their most progressive stages.

==Neurobiological basis==
The [[temporal lobe]] is involved in understanding.&lt;ref name=smith07&gt;{{cite book|last=Smith|last2=Kosslyn|title=Cognitive Psychology: Mind and Brain|year=2007|publisher=Prentice Hall|location=New Jersey|pages=21, 194–199, 349}}&lt;/ref&gt; Intellectual curiosity might be regarded as the trait that motivates growth of understanding in the [[temporal lobe]]. Motivation is effectuated by the neurotransmitter dopamine&lt;ref name=pmid24911320&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1037/a0037128 |pmid=24911320 |title=Dopamine modulates novelty seeking behavior during decision making |journal=Behavioral Neuroscience |volume=128 |issue=5 |pages=556–66 |year=2014 |last1=Costa |first1=Vincent D |last2=Tran |first2=Valery L |last3=Turchi |first3=Janita |last4=Averbeck |first4=Bruno B }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Similarity to other concepts==
Due to a high level of correlation (.78), it has been argued that [[need for cognition]] and [[typical intellectual engagement]] basically are measuring the same trait.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/j.paid.2007.04.022 |title=Integrating personality and intelligence: Typical intellectual engagement and need for cognition |journal=Personality and Individual Differences |volume=43 |issue=6 |pages=1635–9 |year=2007 |last1=Woo |first1=Sang Eun |last2=Harms |first2=Peter D |last3=Kuncel |first3=Nathan R }}&lt;/ref&gt; Intellectual curiosity might be regarded as an umbrella term for these two traits.

A '''Jefferson fracture''' is a [[bone fracture]] of the anterior and [[Atlas (anatomy)#Posterior arch|posterior arches]] of the C1 vertebra,&lt;ref name = Wheeless&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.wheelessonline.com/ortho/atlas_frx_jefferson_fracture | title = Atlas Frx / Jefferson Fracture  | accessdate = 2007-11-29 | last = Wheeless | first = Clifford | publisher = [[Duke University]] Division of Orthopaedic Surgery }}&lt;/ref&gt; though it may also appear as a three- or two-part fracture.  The fracture may result from an [[axial loading|axial load]] on the back of the head or [[Extension (kinesiology)|hyperextension]] of the neck (e.g. caused by [[Diving (sport)|diving]]), causing a posterior break, and may be accompanied by a break in other parts of the [[cervical spine]].&lt;ref name = Wheeless/&gt;

It is named after the [[United Kingdom|British]] neurologist and neurosurgeon Sir [[Geoffrey Jefferson]], who reported four cases of the fracture in 1920 in addition to reviewing cases that had been reported previously.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Jefferson G|title=Fracture of the atlas vertebra: report of four cases, and a review of those previously recorded|year=1920|journal=Br J Surg| volume=7|issue=27|pages=407–22|doi=10.1002/bjs.1800072713}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Signs and symptoms==
Individuals with Jefferson fractures usually experience [[pain]] in the upper neck but no [[Neurology#Testing examinations|neurological signs]].  The fracture may also cause damage to the arteries in the neck, resulting in [[lateral medullary syndrome]], [[Horner's syndrome]], [[ataxia]], and the inability to sense pain or temperature.&lt;ref name = Wheeless/&gt;

In rare cases, [[Congenital disorder|congenital abnormality]] may cause the same symptoms as a Jefferson fracture.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=de Zoete A, Langeveld UA |title=A congenital anomaly of the atlas as a diagnostic dilemma: a case report |journal=J Manipulative Physiol Ther |volume=30 |issue=1 |pages=62–4 |year=2007 |pmid=17224357 |doi=10.1016/j.jmpt.2006.11.011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Gehweiler JA, Daffner RH, Roberts L |title=Malformations of the atlas vertebra simulating the Jefferson fracture |journal=AJR Am J Roentgenol |volume=140 |issue=6 |pages=1083–6 |year=1983 |pmid=6602470 |doi=10.2214/ajr.140.6.1083}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Cause==
[[File:Jeffersonfraktur - 84jm- CT axial - 001.jpg|thumb|400x400px|Axial CT scan showing a Jefferson fracture.]]
Jefferson fracture is often caused by an impact or load on the [[Occiput|back of the head]], and are frequently associated with diving into shallow water, impact against the roof of a vehicle and falls,&lt;ref name = Foster&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.emedicine.com/orthoped/topic31.htm | title = C1 Fractures | date = 2006-12-01 | accessdate = 2007-11-29 | last = Foster | first = Mark | publisher = [[WebMD]] }}&lt;/ref&gt; and in children may occur due to falls from playground equipment.&lt;ref name = Korinth&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Korinth MC, Kapser A, Weinzierl MR |title=Jefferson fracture in a child--illustrative case report |journal=Pediatr Neurosurg |volume=43 |issue=6 |pages=526–30 |year=2007 |pmid=17992046 |doi=10.1159/000108801}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Less frequently, strong [[rotation]] of the head may also result in Jefferson fractures.&lt;ref name = Foster/&gt;

Jefferson fractures are extremely rare in children, but recovery is usually complete without [[surgery]].&lt;ref name = Korinth/&gt;

==Treatment==
The use of [[surgery]] to treat a Jefferson fracture is somewhat controversial.&lt;ref name = Hein&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Hein C, Richter HP, Rath SA |title=Atlantoaxial screw fixation for the treatment of isolated and combined unstable jefferson fractures - experiences with 8 patients |journal=Acta Neurochir (Wien) |volume=144 |issue=11 |pages=1187–92 |year=2002 |pmid=12434175 |doi=10.1007/s00701-002-0998-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Non-surgical treatment varies depending on if the fracture is stable or unstable, defined by an intact or broken [[Transverse ligament of the atlas|transverse ligament]] and degree of fracture of the [[Atlas (anatomy)#Anterior arch|anterior arch]].&lt;ref name = Wheeless/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Lee C, Woodring JH |title=Unstable Jefferson variant atlas fractures: an unrecognized cervical injury |journal=AJNR Am J Neuroradiol |volume=12 |issue=6 |pages=1105–10 |year=1991 |pmid=1763734 |doi=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  An intact ligament requires the use of a soft or hard collar, while a ruptured ligament may require [[Traction (orthopedics)|traction]], a [[Halo (medicine)|halo]] or surgery.  The use of rigid halos can lead to intracranial infections and are often uncomfortable for individuals wearing them, and may be replaced with a more flexible alternative depending on the stability of the injured bones, but treatment of a stable injury with a halo collar can result in a full recovery.&lt;ref name = Lee&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Lee TT, Green BA, Petrin DR |title=Treatment of stable burst fracture of the atlas (Jefferson fracture) with rigid cervical collar |journal=Spine |volume=23 |issue=18 |pages=1963–7 |year=1998 |pmid=9779528 |doi=10.1097/00007632-199809150-00008}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Surgical treatment of a Jefferson fracture involves [[Vertebral fusion|fusion]] or [[Vertebral fixation|fixation]] of the first three [[cervical vertebrae]];&lt;ref name = Wheeless/&gt;&lt;ref name = Hein/&gt; fusion may occur immediately, or later during treatment in cases where non-surgical interventions are unsuccessful.&lt;ref name = Hein/&gt;  A primary factor in deciding between surgical and non-surgical intervention is the degree of stability&lt;ref name = Hein/&gt;&lt;ref name = Lee/&gt; as well as the presence of damage to other cervical vertebrae.&lt;ref name = Lee/&gt;

Though a serious injury, the long-term consequences of a Jefferson's fracture are uncertain and may not impact longevity or abilities, even if untreated.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Mindell ER |title=James Platt White, MD (1811-1881): his interesting and remarkable accident |journal=Clin.

== Career ==
In 2009 Arcand launched ''From Earth to the Universe'' with [[UNESCO]], a series of large exhibitions that occurred in 1,000 locations around the world.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.fromearthtotheuniverse.org/event_photos.php|title=From Earth to the Universe Exhibition|website=www.fromearthtotheuniverse.org|access-date=2018-11-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; She is Principal Investigator of the Aesthetics and Astronomy image response project at the [[Harvard–Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics]].&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://astroart.cfa.harvard.edu/about|title=About {{!}} Aesthetics &amp; Astronomy|website=astroart.cfa.harvard.edu|language=en-US|access-date=2018-11-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; The project launched in 2010 and looks at variations in the presentation of colour and scale in astronomical images. They look at how people respond to images, and the misconceptions that non-experts have when they view them.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; The project began when Randall and Lisa Smith realised that there was a lot [[Astrophysics|astrophysicists]] could learn from art about how to present results.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://news.harvard.edu/gazette/story/2011/09/scientific-research-artfully-shown/|title=Scientific research, artfully shown|date=2011-09-22|work=Harvard Gazette|access-date=2018-11-14|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; The group explored the public perception of astronomical pictures using a survey linked to the [[NASA]] Astronomical Picture of the Day site, gaining almost 10,000 responses.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Smith|first=Lisa F.|last2=Smith|first2=Jeffrey K.|last3=Arcand|first3=Kimberly K.|last4=Smith|first4=Randall K.|last5=Bookbinder|first5=Jay|last6=Keach|first6=Kelly|date=2010-08-18|title=Aesthetics and Astronomy: Studying the Public’s Perception and Understanding of Imagery From Space|url=https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/1075547010379579|journal=Science Communication|language=en|volume=33|issue=2|pages=201–238|doi=10.1177/1075547010379579|issn=1075-5470}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2013 Arcand earned a [[Master's degree]] in Public [[Humanities]] from [[Brown University]].

She worked closely with [[UNESCO]] to celebrate the [[International Year of Light]].&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Citation|last=Chandra X-ray Observatory|title=Light Beyond the Bulb: Bent Light in Space|date=2015-10-13|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u-p4IakVWc8|access-date=2018-11-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was an open-source exhibition that showcased science based on light.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://lightexhibit.org/|title=LIGHT: Beyond the Bulb|website=lightexhibit.org|language=en|access-date=2018-11-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; The celebration was supported by [[SPIE]].&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; Using [[NASA]] data, Arcand developed a way to [[3D printing|3D print]] a supernova remnant and virtual reality application.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://chandra.si.edu/deadstar/deadstar.html|title=X-RAY UNIVERSE|website=chandra.si.edu|language=en|access-date=2018-11-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://chandra.si.edu/vr/|title=Walking among the stars|website=chandra.si.edu|language=en|access-date=2018-11-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Smith: ''Flexible product development: building agility for changing markets'', John Wiley &amp; Sons, 2007, {{ISBN|978-0-7879-9584-3}}, [https://books.google.com/books?id=uqMP-2L4wjQC&amp;pg=PA245 p. 245]&lt;/ref&gt; She also contributed to the book ''97 Things Every Software Architect Should Know'', edited by [[Kevlin Henney]] and published by O´Reilly in 2009 ({{ISBN|059652269X}}).

== University education ==
In 1964, Rising obtained a bachelor's degree in chemistry at the [[University of Kansas]], in 1984 a Master of Science degree in [[computer science]] at [[Southern Illinois University]] and in 1987 a M. A. in mathematics at the [[Southwest Missouri State University]]. In 1992, Rising obtained her [[PhD]] degree in [[computer science]] from the [[Arizona State University]], with her thesis entitled ''Information hiding metrics for modular programming languages'' relating to object-based design metrics.&lt;ref name="cox"&gt;[http://members.cox.net/risingl1/Articles/resume.html Linda Rising] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090401174619/http://members.cox.net/risingl1/Articles/resume.html |date=2009-04-01 }} at cox.net&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.infoq.com/interviews/Linda-Rising-Customer-Interaction-Patterns Linda Rising on Customer Interaction Patterns], Interview with Linda Rising by Dan Puckett on December 29, 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

== Teaching ==
Rising taught as instructor in mathematics and computer science at various universities throughout the midwest from 1977 to 1984 and worked as [[assistant professor]] from 1984 to 1987 at [[Indiana University – Purdue University Fort Wayne]].&lt;ref name="cox"/&gt;

== Industry, consulting and writing ==
In industry, she worked in the areas of telecommunications, avionics, and tactical weapons systems.&lt;ref name="meetup-15941783"&gt;[http://www.meetup.com/skillsmatter/calendar/15941783/ Linda Rising] at: Meetup - OpenSource &amp; Agile Community Events&lt;/ref&gt;

Rising has extended the use of ''patterns'', building upon the work of [[Christopher Alexander]] on a [[pattern language]] for architecture and the work of the ''[[Design Patterns|Gang of Four]]'' on [[Design pattern (computer science)|patterns for software development]]. She extended the use of patterns to the support of [[Change management|organisational change]]. Her work and lectures cover [[pattern]]s, [[retrospectives]], [[agile development]] approaches and the [[change process]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://qconlondon.com/london-2008/speaker/Linda+Rising Linda Rising] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120513001827/http://qconlondon.com/london-2008/speaker/Linda%20Rising |date=2012-05-13 }}, QCon&lt;/ref&gt; topics on which she is an internationally known lecturer.&lt;ref name="meetup-15941783"/&gt;

Since 2010, she is editor of the ''Insights'' series of the [[IEEE Software]] magazine.&lt;ref&gt;Linda Rising: ''Telling Our Stories'', IEEE Software, IEEE Computer Society, May/June 2010, pp. 6-7 (available online from her [http://www.lindarising.org/ homepage])&lt;/ref&gt;

Her book ''The Pattern Almanac 2000'' provides a comprehensive inventory of patterns compiled from publications in patterns conferences and books prior to the year 2000.&lt;ref name="mussbacher"&gt;Gunter Mussbacher, Daniel Amyot, Michael Weiss: ''Formalizing patterns with user requirements notation'', In: Toufuk Taibi: ''Design patterns formalisation techniques'', IGI Publishing, {{ISBN|978-1-59904-219-0}}, p. 302-323, Page: 315&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="birukou"&gt;Aliaksandr Birukou, Enrico Blanzieri, Paolo Giorgini: ''Facilitating Pattern Repository Access with the Implicit Culture Framework'', [http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/summary?doi=10.1.1.77.2404 DOI 10.1.1.77.2404], [http://disi.unitn.it/~pgiorgio/papers/EPLOP07.pdf p. 1]&lt;/ref&gt; The patterns are listed by name and divided into categories, and for each pattern a rudimentary description as well as a reference to a book, journal or URL where the actual published pattern can be found is provided.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.angelikalanger.com/Articles/Reviews/PatternAlmanac/review.htm A directory of patterns] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110707143251/http://www.angelikalanger.com/Articles/Reviews/PatternAlmanac/review.htm |date=2011-07-07 }} (book review)&lt;/ref&gt; ''The Pattern Almanac 2000'' has been cited as reference on existing patterns&lt;ref name="mussbacher"/&gt; and used as starting-point of further research.&lt;ref&gt;C.

Many synthetic [[cannabinoid]]s were designed by Pfizer in the 1970s and 1980s, and feature an alphanumeric code beginning with the prefix "CP". Recently, several members of this class of cannabinoids have been discovered in recreational drug products.

* [[CP 47,497]] &amp;mdash;
* [[(C6)-CP 47,497]] &amp;mdash;
* [[(C7)-CP 47,497]] (CP 47,497 itself) &amp;mdash;
* [[(C8)-CP 47,497]] (Cannabicyclohexanol) &amp;mdash;
* [[(C9)-CP 47,497]] &amp;mdash;
* [[CP 50,556-1]] (Levonantradol) &amp;mdash;
* [[CP 55,244]] &amp;mdash;
* [[CP 55,940]] &amp;mdash;
* [[(±)-CP 55,940]] &amp;mdash; (±)-CP 55,940 is a widely used cannabinoid research tool.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6412">This is a '''list of diseases''' known (or declared) to have been '''[[Eradication of infectious diseases |eliminated]] from the United States''', either permanently or at one time. Most of the diseases listed were eliminated after coordinated public health campaigns. (Since some diseases can be eliminated and then reintroduced at a later time, such diseases are still eligible for the list, but with the fact of reintroduction noted.) Some entries are based on formal public health declarations, others are based on reliable information in the medical or public health literature. Since some diseases can be eliminated, but subsequently reimported without transmitting additional [[Endemic (epidemiology)|endemic]] cases, these are noted in a dedicated column. Although no fixed rule always applies, many infectious diseases (e.g., measles) are considered eliminated when no cases have been reported to public health authorities for at least 12 months.

(NB: In recent years, "elimination" is the preferred term for "regional eradication" of a disease; the term "eradication" is reserved for the reduction of an infectious disease's ''global'' prevalence to zero.)

==Possible future eliminations==
Various public health projects are going on, with a goal of eliminating diseases from the country. Several infectious diseases in the United States, not on the above list, are considered close to elimination (98-99% reductions): e.g., ''[[Hemophilus influenzae]]'', [[mumps]], [[rubella]], [[congenital rubella]], and [[tetanus]].  Other disease pathogens (e.g., those of [[anthrax]] and [[rabies]]) have been almost entirely eliminated from humans in the US, but remain as hazards in the environment, so cannot accurately be described as eliminated.  The stated goal of "eradication" of [[hookworm]] from the southeast US (1915-20) was not achieved, although the hookworm-infection rate of that region did drop by more than half.&lt;ref&gt;[[Hoyt Bleakley|Bleakley, Hoyt]], [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3800113/ “Disease and Development: Evidence from Hookworm Eradication in the American South”], ''Q J Econ''. 2007; 122(1): 73–117.&lt;/ref&gt;
{{listdev|date=March 2016}}
*In 1954, Congressional funds were first approved for a Cooperative State-Federal Brucellosis Eradication Program to eliminate the disease from the country. ([[Brucellosis]] is a problem mainly in livestock. In 1956, 124,000 affected herds were found by testing in the US. By 1992, the number had dropped to 700 herds and the number of affected, domestic herds has declined to single digits since then.) 
*The [[Centers for Disease Control and Prevention|CDC]] Division of TB Elimination has a goal of controlling [[tuberculosis]] and eliminating it from the United States by minimizing the likelihood of ''[[Mycobacterium tuberculosis]]'' transmission, which will prevent the occurrence of new cases.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=CDC TB Division Mission Statement and Activities|url=https://www.cdc.gov/tb/about/mission.htm|website=www.cdc.gov|accessdate=19 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*The Oral Rabies Vaccine (ORV) Program has a goal of preventing the spread of raccoon variant rabies and eventually eliminating it from the United States.
*An effort has been made for several years to eliminate [[syphilis]] from the US.&lt;ref&gt;Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. 2010 National STD Prevention Conference.  2010. https://www.cdc.gov/stdconference/2006/media/SEE-fact-sheet.htm. May 9, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; The rate of infection decreased through the 1990s, and in 2000, it was the lowest since reporting began in 1941, leading the US Surgeon General to issue a plan to eliminate the disease from the country. It has been staging a comeback, however, increasing each year since 2001.

'''Peenemünde Airfield''' {{Airport codes|PEF|EDCP}}&lt;ref&gt;{{WAD|EDCP}}&lt;/ref&gt; is an airfield along the [[Baltic Sea]] north of [[Peenemünde]], Germany.  Today round trips in light aircraft take place from Peenemünde Airfield. Bus tours are also available, on which one can visit the former shelters of the NVA and the remnants of the [[V-1 flying bomb facilities]]. Because of its long runway the airfield Peenemünde is also a location for [[flight school]]s.

==History==
On April 2, 1936, the [[Reich Air Ministry]] paid 750,000 [[German Reichsmark]]s to the town of [[Wolgast]]&lt;ref name=Dornberger&gt;

V-1 launch crew training was at the nearby resort of [[Zempin]], and after [[Bombing of Peenemünde in World War II|the August 1943 Operation ''Hydra'' bombing]] of the area, V-1 flight testing was moved to  [[Brüsterort]].&lt;ref name=Cooksley/&gt;{{Rp|27}}  Peenemünde West also developed [[Battle of the Beams|World War II night-navigation and radar systems]] (Dr. [[Johannes Plendl]]).{{Citation needed|reason=Statement originally at Peenemünde wikipage|date=December 2007}}  After the [[2nd Belorussian Front]] under General [[Konstantin Rokossovsky]] captured the [[Świnoujście|Swinemünde]] port and [[Usedom]] island on May 5, 1945, the airfield became part of the [[Allied Occupation Zones in Germany|Soviet Zone of Occupation]].

===Post-war===
[[File:Peenemünde Airfield.png|thumbnail|left|Peenemünde Airfield]]
In 1956, the airfield received a new 2,465&amp;nbsp;metre-long concrete runway, which is oriented in a northwesterly direction and allows the operation of modern military jet planes. A further landmark is the collection of [[radio beacon]]s at the northwest end, which were built{{When|date=May 2011}} on artificial islands in the sea. In 1961, the airfield was transferred to the [[National People's Army]] (NVA), which used it until 1989.  After 1989, the airfield was used among other things as parking area of former military vehicles of the NVA. From Summer 2010, a high-performance [[jet trainer]] [[aircraft]] [[Aero L-39]] Albatros of the former [[National People's Army]] (NVA) is back on Peenemünde Airfield.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.migflug.com/jet-fluege/angebote/l-39-albatros-in-deutschland.html Aero L-39 Albatros on Peenemünde]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Port Lockroy''' is a [[Harbor#Natural harbors|natural harbour]] on the north-western shore of [[Wiencke Island]] in the [[Palmer Archipelago]] in front of the [[Antarctic Peninsula]]. The Antarctic base includes the most southerly operational [[post office]] in the world.

==History==
The bay was discovered during 1904 and named after [[Edouard Lockroy]], a French politician and Vice President of the Chamber of Deputies, who assisted [[Jean-Baptiste Charcot]] in obtaining government funding for his [[French Antarctic Expedition]].  The harbour was used for [[whaling]] between 1911 and 1931.  During [[World War II]], the British military [[Operation Tabarin]] established the Port Lockroy '''Station A''' on tiny [[Goudier Island]] in the bay, which continued to operate as a British [[research station]] until January 16, 1962.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.bas.ac.uk/about/about-bas/our-history/british-research-stations-and-refuges/port-lockroy-a/ Station A] ''British Antarctic Survey''&lt;/ref&gt;

During 1996, the Port Lockroy base was renovated and is now a museum and [[post office]] operated by the [[United Kingdom Antarctic Heritage Trust]].

It is one of the most popular tourist destinations for cruise-ship passengers in Antarctica. Proceeds from the small souvenir shop fund the maintenance of the site and other historic sites and monuments in [[Antarctica]].&lt;ref name=baslockroy&gt;{{cite web |title=Port Lockroy Station |publisher=British Antarctic Survey |url=https://www.bas.ac.uk/polar-operations/life-in-the-polar-regions/virtual-tours/virtual-trip-to-antarctica/port-lockroy/ |date=&lt;!--undated--&gt; |accessdate=2016-02-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Trust collects data for the [[British Antarctic Survey]] to observe the effect of tourism on penguins. Half the island is open to tourists, while the other half is reserved for penguins. A staff of four typically process 70,000 pieces of mail sent by 18,000 visitors that arrive during the five month Antarctic cruise season.&lt;ref name=cbsnews-18feb2015&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.cbsnews.com/news/wanted-postmaster-at-the-end-of-the-world/ |title=Wanted: Postmaster at the end of the world |website=[[CBS News]] |date=2015-02-18 |first=Kim |last=Peterson}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=pbs-28jan2015&gt;{{cite episode |url=https://www.pbs.org/wnet/nature/penguin-post-office/11498/ |title=Penguin Post Office |airdate=2015-01-28 |network=[[PBS]] |series=Nature |season=33 |number=9 |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=pbs-21jan2015&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.pbs.org/wnet/nature/blog/living-and-working-among-antarctic-penguins-post-office/ |title=What It’s Like to Live and Work Among Antarctic Penguins |website=[[PBS]] |date=2015-01-21 |first=Liesl |last=Schernthanner}}&lt;/ref&gt;  A souvenir [[passport stamp]] is also offered to visitors.&lt;ref&gt;[http://travelblog.viator.com/penguins-and-postcards-in-port-lockroy-antarctica/ Penguins and Postcards in Port Lockroy, Antarctica]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Historic site===
The historic importance of the site relates to both its establishment as an [[Operation Tabarin]] base during 1944, and for the scientific work performed there, including the first measurements of the [[ionosphere]], and the first recording of an [[Auroral chorus|atmospheric whistler]], from Antarctica. It was also a key monitoring site during the [[International Geophysical Year]] (1957). The site has been designated a [[Historic Sites and Monuments in Antarctica|Historic Site or Monument]] (HSM 61), following a proposal by the United Kingdom to the [[Antarctic Treaty System|Antarctic Treaty Consultative Meeting]].&lt;ref name=atcm&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ats.aq/documents/ATCM35/WW/atcm35_ww003_e.pdf |title=List of Historic Sites and Monuments approved by the ATCM (2012)|accessdate=2014-01-04 |work= |first= |last= |publisher=Antarctic Treaty Secretariat |year=2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==

During [[World War II]] the [[United States Office of War Information]] (OWI) launched a large-scale information and propaganda campaign both at home and abroad through radio broadcasts, newspapers, posters, photographs, films and other forms of media, but ''psychological warfare'' operations had been run by special military units.

After the end of the war President [[Harry S. Truman|Truman]] transferred the operations of the OWI as well as control over [[Voice of America]] overseas radio network to the Interim International Information Service (IIS) within the State Department.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Needell|first=Allan|title=Science, Cold War and the American State|url={{Google books|mMDSO8Ci42cC|page=156|plainurl=yes}}|page=156}}&lt;/ref&gt; The State Department, eager to assert leadership in this area, organized a civilian-sponsored project on new methods and approaches to [[Cold War]] propaganda, code-named Project Troy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Needell|first=Allan|title=Science, Cold War and the American State|url={{Google books|mMDSO8Ci42cC|page=155|plainurl=yes}}|page=155}}&lt;/ref&gt; Convened in October 1950 at the State Department's request, it brought together for a period of almost three months a group of twenty-one distinguished scientists, social scientists, and historians, most of whom were academics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://academic.oup.com/dh/article-abstract/17/3/399/392265/Truth-Is-Our-Weapon-Project-TROY-Political-Warfare|title="Truth Is Our Weapon": Project TROY, Political Warfare, and Government-Academic Relations in the National Security State|date=1 June 2007|first=Allan|last=Needell}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It can be assumed that the Truman administration tried to implement plans established by the Project Troy in the project ''Overload and Delay''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Mitrovich|first=Gregory|title=Undermining the Kremlin: America's Strategy to Subvert the Soviet Bloc, 1947–1956|url={{Google books|w6TVdT-q7vcC|page=77|plainurl=yes}}|page=77}}&lt;/ref&gt; The purpose of the latter was to break the [[Stalinism|Stalinist]] system by increasing the number of input points in the system and by creating complex and unpredictable situations requiring action.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Mitrovich|first=Gregory|title=Undermining the Kremlin: America's Strategy to Subvert the Soviet Bloc, 1947–1956|url={{Google books|w6TVdT-q7vcC|page=76|plainurl=yes}}|page=76}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Memorandum on the Troy Report ==

On 26 March 1951 Robert J. Hooker delivered a memorandum on the Troy Report to the Director of the [[Policy Planning Staff (United States)|Policy Planning Staff]] [[Paul Nitze]], asserting that the report "deserves the most serious consideration. It lays down principles and techniques for the conduct of political warfare which, with few exceptions, seem worthy of adoption."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://history.state.gov/historicaldocuments/frus1950-55Intel/d59 |title=Memorandum From Robert J.

'''San Francisco Women on the Web''' (SFWOW) is a [[nonprofit organization]] based in [[San Francisco]], [[California]]. It works to serve, educate and empower women in technology through professional development, support, and networking opportunities. In 1998, the organization created a nationally recognized awards program called the '''Top 25 Women on the Web''', a program that continued through 2007.

==History==
San Francisco Women on the Web began as a chapter of [[Webgrrls]]. The volunteers of that chapter broke away in 1998 and formed an independent organization&lt;ref&gt;Laura Lambert, Hilary W. Poole, Chris Woodford, Christos J. P. Moschovitis. ''The Internet: A Historical Encyclopedia.'' ABC-CLIO, 2005, {{ISBN|1-85109-659-0}}.&lt;/ref&gt; and began discussions and paperwork to achieve nonprofit status, which they did in 2000. In 1998, while still a part of Webgrrls, the San Francisco volunteers created an awards program called the Top 25 Women on the Web, which was held up to 2001 and garnered regular press attention, including national coverage. Membership (non-dues) totaled 1807 in 2007. Volunteer-run, it organized workshops, from HTML to Java, events, monthly meetings, study groups, coffee klatches, and "scrappies" a kind of happy hour networking gathering.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4417">'''Dr. Sighard F. Hoerner''' (born 18 April 1906, [[Münster]], Germany — d. 22 June 1971, [[Brick Township, New Jersey|Brick Town]], USA) &lt;ref&gt;Hager, Willy (2009). ''Hydraulicians in Europe 1800-2000, Volume 2'', p. 1093. CRC Press, London. {{ISBN|9789078046066}}.&lt;/ref&gt; was an important figure in the aerodynamics field and is known worldwide for his two compendiums of aerodynamic knowledge, ''Fluid-Dynamic Drag'' and ''Fluid-Dynamic Lift''. He is also notable for his design work on the pioneering STOL aircraft, the [[Fieseler Fi 156|Fieseler Fi 156 ''Storch'']].

==Education==
Dr. Hoerner studied mechanical engineering at the [[Technical University of Munich]], earning a Dipl.Ing. and he earned a degree as Dr.-Ing. in aerodynamics at the Institute of Technology at Braunschweig.  Finally, he obtained a degree as Dr.-Ing.-habil. from the TH Berlin.&lt;ref&gt;[Hoerner 1965]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career==
Initially, he served as research assistant at the Deutsche Versuchsanstalt fur Luftfahrt (DVL, near Berlin).  After this, he worked as an aerodynamicist at the Fieseler Corporation, where he worked on the aerodynamic design of the [[Fieseler Fi 156 Storch]] STOL aircraft.  From there, he went to [[Junkers]], where he worked as the head of design aerodynamics, before going to [[Messerschmitt]], where he worked as a research aerodynamicist during [[World War II]].  After the war, he was "invited" ([[Operation Paperclip]]) to emigrate to the United States, where he worked in aerodynamics at [[Wright Field]] in Ohio. Eventually, he ended up working as a specialist in aerodynamics and hydrodynamics in the field of naval architecture at Gibbs &amp; Cox, Inc. in New York City.&lt;ref&gt;[Hoerner 1965]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Contributions==
In 1945 and 1946, Dr. Hoerner prepared a manuscript for the book ''Aerodynamic Drag''.  The technical publishing houses in New York City were not confident enough to bring a book as specialized as this to the market.  As a result, he published the book himself in 1951, using a photo-offset process and sold copies of the book by mail order from his home.&lt;ref&gt;[Hoerner 1951]&lt;/ref&gt; The book got very good reviews and demand was steady. In 1958 it was reissued as ''Fluid-Dynamic Drag''. With the rapid progress in aerodynamics over the years, he prepared an update to the book, which was published in 1965.&lt;ref&gt;[Hoerner 1965]&lt;/ref&gt;  As before, the book was self-published by Hoerner Fluid Dynamics. This book contains documentation of the worldwide knowledge (at the time) of the sources of aerodynamic drag and the means to quantify aerodynamic drag. While substantial knowledge on this subject has been learned since 1965, this book is often the starting point in work where aerodynamic drag must be calculated.

The US Navy Office of Naval Research gave Dr. Hoerner a contract in the mid-1960s to write a companion volume ''Fluid-Dynamic Lift''. Co-authored with Henry V. "Hank" Borst, this book was published by Hoerner Fluid Dynamics in 1975. Unfortunately, Dr. Hoerner died  before publication. This book, like its companion, contains documentation of the worldwide knowledge on the generation of aerodynamic lift and is still used heavily.&lt;ref&gt;[Hoerner 1975]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Personal life==
Dr. Hoerner was married to Liselotte A. Hoerner. After his death, she continued the mail order business, selling copies of both books to engineers around the world.&lt;ref&gt;[Hoerner 1975]&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Space Shuttle orbiter''' was the [[spaceplane]] component of the [[Space Shuttle]], a partially [[reusable launch system|reusable]] orbital [[spacecraft]] system that was part of the [[Space Shuttle program]]. Operated by [[NASA]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nasa.gov/centers/kennedy/shuttleoperations/orbiters/orbiters_toc.html |title=Facts About the Space Shuttles |publisher=NASA}}&lt;/ref&gt; the U.S. space agency, this vehicle could carry astronauts and payloads into [[low Earth orbit]], perform in-space operations, then [[atmospheric entry|re-enter the atmosphere]] and land as a [[glider aircraft|glider]], returning its crew and any on-board payload to the Earth.

Six orbiters were built for flight: ''[[Space Shuttle Enterprise|Enterprise]]'', ''[[Space Shuttle Columbia|Columbia]]'', ''[[Space Shuttle Challenger|Challenger]]'', ''[[Space Shuttle Discovery|Discovery]]'', ''[[Space Shuttle Atlantis|Atlantis]]'', and ''[[Space Shuttle Endeavour|Endeavour]]''. All were built in [[Palmdale, California]], by the [[Pittsburgh]], [[Pennsylvania]]-based [[Rockwell International]] company. The first orbiter, ''Enterprise'', made its maiden flight in 1977. An unpowered glider, it was carried by a modified [[Boeing 747]] airliner called the [[Shuttle Carrier Aircraft]] and released for a series of atmospheric test flights and landings. ''Enterprise'' was partially disassembled and retired after completion of critical testing. The remaining orbiters were fully operational spacecraft, and were launched vertically as part of the [[Space Shuttle]] stack.

''Columbia'' was the first space-worthy orbiter, and made its inaugural flight in 1981. ''Challenger'', ''Discovery'', and ''Atlantis'' followed in 1983, 1984 and 1985 respectively. In 1986, ''Challenger'' was [[Space Shuttle Challenger disaster|destroyed in an accident]] shortly after launch. ''Endeavour'' was built as ''Challenger''{{'}}s replacement, and was first launched in 1992. In 2003, ''Columbia'' was [[Space Shuttle Columbia disaster|destroyed during re-entry]], leaving just three remaining orbiters. ''Discovery'' completed its final flight on March 9, 2011, and ''Endeavour'' completed its final flight on June 1, 2011. ''Atlantis'' completed the last ever Shuttle flight, [[STS-135]], on July 21, 2011.

In addition to their crews and payloads, the reusable orbiter carried most of the [[Space Shuttle|Space Shuttle System]]'s [[liquid-propellant rocket|liquid-fueled rocket propulsion system]], but both the [[liquid hydrogen]] [[fuel#Chemical|fuel]] and the [[liquid oxygen]] [[oxidizer]] for its three [[Space Shuttle Main Engine|main rocket engines]] were fed from an [[Space Shuttle external tank|external cryogenic propellant tank]]. Additionally, two reusable [[Space Shuttle Solid Rocket Booster|solid rocket boosters]] provided additional thrust for approximately the first two minutes of launch. The orbiters themselves did carry [[hypergolic propellant]]s for their RCS [[Spacecraft propulsion|thrusters]] and Orbital Maneuvering System engines.

==Description==

===Attitude control system===
[[File:Shuttle front RCS.jpg|thumb|Space Shuttle forward reaction control thrusters]]

The Space Shuttle orbiter resembled an [[airplane]] in its design, with a standard-looking [[fuselage]] and two [[double delta]] wings, both [[swept wing]]s at an angle of 81 [[degree (angle)|degrees]] at their inner [[leading edge]]s and 45 degrees at their outer leading edges. The [[vertical stabilizer]] of the orbiter had a [[leading edge]] that was swept back at a 45-degree angle. There were four [[elevon]]s mounted at the [[trailing edge]]s of the delta wings, and the combination [[Flight control surfaces#Rudder 2|rudder]] and [[speed brake]] was attached at the trailing edge of the [[vertical stabilizer]]. These, along with a movable body flap located underneath the main engines, controlled the orbiter during later stages of descent through the [[atmosphere]] and landing.

Overall, the Space Shuttle orbiter was roughly the same size as a [[McDonnell Douglas DC-9]] [[airliner]].

The [[Reaction Control System]] (RCS) was composed of 44 small [[liquid-fuel rocket|liquid-fueled rocket]] thrusters and their very sophisticated [[fly-by-wire]] [[flight control system]], which utilized computationally intensive digital [[Kalman filter]]ing. This control system carried out the usual [[aircraft attitude|attitude control]] along the pitch, roll, and yaw axes during all of the flight phases of launching, [[orbit]]ing, and re-entry. This system also executed any needed orbital maneuvers, including all changes in the orbit's altitude, [[orbital plane (astronomy)|orbital plane]], and [[orbital eccentricity|eccentricity]]. These were all operations that required a lot more power and energy than mere attitude control.

The forward rockets of the Reaction Control System, located near the nose of the Space Shuttle orbiter, included 14 primary and two [[Vernier thruster|vernier]] RCS rockets. The aft RCS engines were located in the two [[Orbital Maneuvering System]] (OMS) pods at the rear of the orbiter, and these included 12 primary (PRCS) and two vernier (VRCS) engines in each pod. The PRCS system provided the pointing control of the Orbiter, and the VRCS was used for fine maneuvering during the rendezvous, docking, and undocking maneuvers with the [[International Space Station]], or formerly with the Russian [[Mir space station]]. The RCS also controlled the attitude of the orbiter during most of its re-entry into the Earth's atmosphere – until the air became dense enough that the rudder, elevons and body flap became effective.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://spaceflight.nasa.gov/shuttle/reference/shutref/orbiter/rcs/overview.html |title=HSF – The Shuttle |publisher=Spaceflight.nasa.gov |accessdate=July 17, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the early design process of the orbiter, the forward RCS thrusters were to be hidden underneath retractable doors, which would open once the orbiter reached space. These were omitted in favor of flush-mounted thrusters for fear that the RCS doors would remain stuck open and endanger the crew and orbiter during re-entry.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Young |first=John W. |title=Forever Young: A Life of Adventure in Air and Space |year=2012 |publisher=University Press of Florida |author2=Hansen, James R. |format=Kindle eBook |chapter=4 |quote="In the design plans, we saw that the RCS would have big doors that opened outward. The problem was, if those doors failed to close, the orbiter would be lost as it was coming back through the atmosphere. I wrote a 'review item disposition' (RID) asking NASA to eliminate the outward-opening doors.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Pressurized cabin===
[[File:STSCPanel.jpg|thumb|left|Space Shuttle [[glass cockpit]]]]
[[File:S123 Linnehan through the window.jpg|thumb|A Rear window]]
The orbiter crew cabin consisted of three levels: the flight deck, the mid-deck, and the utility area. The uppermost of these was the flight deck, in which sat the Space Shuttle's commander and pilot, with up to two mission specialists seated behind them. The mid-deck, which was below the flight deck, had three more seats for the rest of the crew members.

The galley, toilet, sleep locations, storage lockers, and the side hatch for entering and exiting the orbiter were also located on the mid-deck, as well as the [[airlock]]. The airlock had an additional hatch into the payload bay. This airlock allowed two or three astronauts, wearing their [[Extravehicular Mobility Unit]] (EMU) space suits, to depressurize before a [[extravehicular activity|walk in space]] ([[Extra-vehicular activity|EVA]]), and also to repressurize and re-enter the orbiter at the conclusion of the EVA.

The utility area was located under the floor of the mid-deck and contained air and water tanks in addition to the [[Carbon dioxide scrubber|carbon dioxide scrubbing]] system.

===Propulsion===
[[File:020408 STS110 Atlantis launch.jpg|thumb|''Atlantis''{{'s}} main engines during launch]]

Three [[Space Shuttle Main Engine]]s (SSMEs) were mounted on the orbiter's aft fuselage in the pattern of an [[equilateral triangle]]. These three liquid-fueled engines [[thrust vectoring|could be swiveled]] 10.5 degrees vertically and 8.5 degrees horizontally during the rocket-powered ascent of the orbiter in order to change the direction of their thrust. Hence, they steered the entire Space Shuttle, as well as providing rocket thrust towards orbit. The aft fuselage also housed three [[auxiliary power unit]]s (APU). The APUs chemically converted [[hydrazine]] fuel from a [[liquid state]] to a [[gas state]], powering a [[hydraulic pump]]  which supplied pressure for all of the hydraulic system, including the hydraulic sub-system that pointed the three main liquid-fueled rocket engines, under computerized [[flight control]]. The hydraulic pressure generated was also used to control all of the orbiter's "[[flight control surfaces]]" (the elevons, rudder, speed brake, etc.), to deploy the [[landing gear]] of the orbiter, and to retract the umbilical hose connection doors located near the rear landing gear, which supplied the orbiter's SSMEs with liquid hydrogen and oxygen from the external tank.

Two [[Orbital Maneuvering System]] (OMS) thrusters were mounted in two separate removable pods on the orbiter's aft fuselage, located between the SSMEs and the vertical stabilizer. The OMS engines provided significant thrust for coarse [[orbital maneuver]]s, including insertion, circularization, transfer, rendezvous, deorbit, [[Space Shuttle abort modes|abort to orbit, and to abort once around]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://science.ksc.nasa.gov/shuttle/technology/sts-newsref/sts-oms.html#sts-oms |title=Orbital Maneuvering System |publisher=Science.ksc.nasa.gov |accessdate=July 17, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;  At lift-off, two [[solid rocket boosters]] (SRBs) were used to take the vehicle to an altitude of roughly 140,000 feet.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|author1=Kulkarni, Nilesh |author2=Krishnakumar, Kalmaje |title=Spacecraft guidance, navigation, and control requirements for an intelligent plug-n-play avionics (PAPA) architecture |work=American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics |publisher=NASA Ames Research Center |hdl=2060/20060019188 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Electrical power===
[[Electric power]] for the orbiter's [[subsystem]]s was provided by a set of three hydrogen-oxygen [[fuel cell]]s which produced 28 volt [[DC power]] and was also converted into 115 volt 400&amp;nbsp;Hz AC [[three-phase electric power]] (for systems that used [[AC power]]).&lt;ref name="Electrical Power System"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://spaceflight.nasa.gov/shuttle/reference/shutref/orbiter/eps/ |work=Shuttle Reference Manual |publisher=NASA Human Spaceflight |title=Electrical Power System |accessdate=February 1, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; These provided power to the entire Shuttle stack (including the SRBs and ET) from T-minus 3m30s up through the end of the mission. The hydrogen and oxygen for the fuel cells was kept in pairs of [[cryogenic]] storage tanks in the mid-fuselage underneath the payload bay liner, and a variable number of such tanks could be installed (up to five) depending on the requirements of the mission. The three fuel cells were capable of generating 21 kilowatts of power continuously (or a 15-minute peak of 36 kilowatts) with the orbiter consuming an average of about 14 kilowatts of that power (leaving 7 kilowatts for the payload).

Additionally, the fuel cells provided [[potable water]] for the crew during the mission.

===Computer systems===
The orbiter's computer system consisted of five identical [[IBM AP-101]] [[avionics]] computers, which redundantly controlled the vehicle's on-board systems. The specialized [[HAL/S]] programming language was used for orbiter systems.&lt;ref name="nasagpc"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://spaceflight.nasa.gov/shuttle/reference/shutref/orbiter/avionics/dps/gpc.html |title=General-Purpose Computers |work=NASA.gov |accessdate=January 18, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="nyt20030207"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2003/02/07/us/loss-shuttle-technology-computers-driving-shuttle-are-be-included-inquiry.html?pagewanted=all |title=Loss of the Shuttle: Technology; Computers Driving Shuttle Are to Be Included in Inquiry |work=[[The New York Times]] |first=Steve |last=Lohr |date=February 7, 2003 |accessdate=January 18, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Thermal protection===
[[File:STS-114 Discovery thermal protection system (S114-E-6412).jpg|thumb|''Discovery''{{'s}} ventral thermal protection system]]

The orbiters were protected by [[Space Shuttle thermal protection system|Thermal Protection System]] (TPS) materials (developed by [[Rockwell International|Rockwell Space Systems]]) inside and out, from the Orbiter's outer surface to the payload bay.&lt;ref name="NASA Tech Briefs"&gt;{{Cite journal|title=NASA Tech Briefs, September 1998 |work=NASA Tech Briefs |publisher=NASA |hdl=2060/20110003618 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The TPS protected it from the cold soak of {{convert|−121|C}} in space to the {{convert|1649|C}} heat of re-entry.

===Structure===
The orbiter's structure was made primarily from [[aluminium alloy]], although the engine thrust structure was made from [[titanium alloy]]. The later orbiters (''Discovery'', ''Atlantis'' and ''Endeavour'') substituted [[graphite epoxy]] for aluminum in some structural elements in order to reduce weight. The windows were made of [[aluminum silicate]] glass and [[fused silica]] glass, and comprised an internal pressure pane, a {{convert|1.3|in|mm|adj=mid|-thick}} optical pane, and an external thermal pane.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nasa.gov/missions/highlights/webcasts/shuttle/sts113/processing-qa.html |title=STS-113 Space Shuttle Processing Questions &amp; Answers (NASA KSC) |publisher=Ksc.nasa.gov |date=November 15, 2002 |accessdate=July 17, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; The windows were tinted with the same ink used to make [[Federal Reserve Note|American banknotes]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=http://www.kansascity.com/105/story/441167-p4.html |title=www.kansascity.com |publisher=Web.archive.org |accessdate=July 17, 2009 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080117121138/http://www.kansascity.com/105/story/441167-p4.html |archivedate=January 17, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Landing gear===
[[File:Space Shuttle Atlantis landing at KSC following STS-122 (crop).jpg|thumb|left|''Atlantis''{{'s}} landing gear are deployed following STS-122]]

The Space Shuttle orbiter had three sets of [[landing gear]] which emerged downwards through doors in the heat shield. As a weight-saving measure, the gear could not be retracted once deployed. Since any premature extension of the landing gear would very likely have been catastrophic (because it opened through the heat shield layers), the landing gear could only be lowered by manual controls, and not by any automatic system.

Similarly, since the Shuttle landed at high speed and could not abort its landing attempt, the gear had to deploy reliably on the first try every time. The gear were unlocked and deployed by triple redundant hydraulics, with the gear doors actuated by mechanical linkages to the gear strut. If all three hydraulic systems failed to release the landing gear uplocks within one second of the release command, pyrotechnic charges automatically cut the lock hooks and a set of springs deployed the gear.

During landing, the Shuttle nose wheel could be steered with the [[rudder pedal]]s in the cockpit. During the construction of {{OV|105}}, an improved nose wheel steering system was developed which allowed easier and better nose wheel steering. After ''Endeavour''{{'s}} roll-out, the system was installed on the other shuttles except ''Challenger'', during their overhauls in the early 1990s.

===Lack of navigational lights===

The Space Shuttle orbiter did not carry [[strobe light|anti-collision lights]], [[navigation light|navigational lights]], or [[aircraft landing lights|landing lights]], because the orbiter always landed in areas that had been specially cleared by both the [[Federal Aviation Administration]] and the [[U.S. Air Force|Air Force]]. The Orbiter nearly always landed at either [[Edwards Air Force Base]] (California) or at the Kennedy Space Center [[Shuttle Landing Facility]] (Florida), although one mission – [[STS-3]] – landed at the [[White Sands Space Harbor]] in New Mexico. Similar special clearances (no-fly zones) were also in effect at potential emergency landing sites, such as in Spain and in West Africa during all launches.

When an orbiter landing was carried out at night, the runway was always strongly illuminated with light from [[High-intensity discharge lamp|floodlights]] and [[Searchlight|spotlights]] on the ground, making landing lights on the orbiter unnecessary and also an unneeded spaceflight weight load. A total of 26 landings took place at night, the first being [[STS-8]] in September 1983.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/shuttle/launch/night_landings.html |title=NASA – Space Shuttle Night Landings |publisher=NASA |accessdate=July 23, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Markings and insignia===
[[File:World's First Five Spaceplanes.PNG|thumb|upright=1.5|The [[Space Shuttle]] orbiter ranks second among the [[world]]'s first [[spaceplane]]s, preceded only by the [[North American X-15]] and followed by the [[Buran (spacecraft)|Buran]], [[SpaceShipOne]], and the [[Boeing X-37]].]]

The [[typeface]] used on the Space Shuttle Orbiter was [[Helvetica]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite video |date=September 12, 2007 |title=[[Helvetica (film)|Helvetica]] |medium=Documentary}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The prototype orbiter ''Enterprise'' originally had a [[flag of the United States]] on the upper surface of the left wing and the letters "USA" in black on the right wing. The name "Enterprise" in black was painted on the payload bay doors just above the forwardmost hinge and behind the crew module; on the aft end of the payload bay doors was the [[NASA insignia|NASA "worm" logotype]] in gray. Underneath the rear of the payload bay doors on the side of the fuselage just above the wing was the text "United States" in black with a [[flag of the United States]] ahead of it.

The first operational orbiter, ''Columbia'', originally had the same markings as ''Enterprise'', although the letters "USA" on the right wing were slightly larger and spaced farther apart. ''Columbia'' also had black tiles which ''Enterprise'' lacked on its forward RCS module, around the cockpit windows, and on its vertical stabilizer. ''Columbia'' also had distinctive black "chines" on the forward part of its upper wing surfaces, which none of the other orbiters had.

''Challenger'' established a modified marking scheme for the shuttle fleet that would be matched by ''Discovery'', ''Atlantis'' and ''Endeavour''. The letters "USA" in black above an American flag were displayed on the left wing, with the NASA "worm" logotype in gray centered above the name of the orbiter in black on the right wing. Also, the name of the orbiter was inscribed not on the payload bay doors, but on the forward fuselage just below and behind the cockpit windows. This would make the name visible when the orbiter was photographed in orbit with the doors open. ''Challenger'' also had black tiles on the tip of its vertical stabilizer much like ''Columbia'', which the other orbiters lacked.

In 1983, ''Enterprise'' had its wing markings changed to match ''Challenger'', and the NASA "worm" logotype on the aft end of the payload bay doors was changed from gray to black. Some black markings were added to the nose, cockpit windows and vertical tail to more closely resemble the flight vehicles, but the name "Enterprise" remained on the payload bay doors as there was never any need to open them. ''Columbia'' had its name moved to the forward fuselage to match the other flight vehicles after [[STS-61-C]], during the 1986–88 hiatus when the shuttle fleet was grounded following the [[Space Shuttle Challenger disaster|loss of ''Challenger'']], but retained its original wing markings until its last overhaul (after [[STS-93]]), and its unique black wing "chines" for the remainder of its operational life.

Beginning in 1998, the flight vehicles' markings were modified to incorporate the NASA [[NASA insignia|"meatball" insignia]].  The "worm" logotype, which the agency had phased out, was removed from the payload bay doors and the "meatball" insignia was added aft of the "United States" text on the lower aft fuselage. The "meatball" insignia was also displayed on the left wing, with the American flag above the orbiter's name, left-justified rather than centered, on the right wing. The three surviving flight vehicles, ''Discovery'', ''Atlantis'' and ''Endeavour'', still bear these markings as museum displays. ''Enterprise'' became the property of the [[Smithsonian Institution]] in 1985 and was no longer under NASA's control when these changes were made, hence the prototype orbiter still has its 1983 markings and still has its name on the payload bay doors.

===Retirement===
With the end of the shuttle program, plans were made to place the three remaining shuttle orbiters on permanent display. NASA Administrator [[Charles Bolden]] announced the disposition location of the orbiters on April 12, 2011, the 50th anniversary of the [[Vostok 1|first human space flight]] and the 30th anniversary of the [[STS-1|first flight]] of ''Columbia''. ''Discovery'' went to the Smithsonian's [[Steven F. Udvar-Hazy Center]], replacing ''Enterprise'' which was moved to the [[Intrepid Sea, Air &amp; Space Museum]] in New York City. ''Endeavour'' went to the [[California Science Center]] in Los Angeles arriving on October 14, 2012. ''Atlantis'' went to the [[Kennedy Space Center]] Visitor Complex on November 2, 2012. Hundreds of other shuttle artifacts will be put on display at various other museums and educational institutions around the US.&lt;ref name="NASA_release_11-107"&gt;{{cite news |first=David |last=Weaver |title=VNASA Announces New Homes For Shuttle Orbiters After Retirement |url=http://www.nasa.gov/home/hqnews/2011/apr/HQ_11-107_Orbiter_Disposition.html |agency=[[NASA]] |date=April 12, 2011 |accessdate=April 12, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Cargo bay is 18.3 m long and 4.6 m wide (60 ft by 15 ft), with a payload rating of 16,050 kg (35,380 lb) to ISS, and return-to-Earth payload of 14,400 kg (31,700 lb

The orbiter's maximum [[glide ratio]]/[[lift-to-drag ratio]] varied considerably with speed, ranging from 1:1 at [[hypersonic speed]]s, 2:1 at [[supersonic speed]]s, and reaching 4.5:1 at subsonic speeds during approach and landing.&lt;ref&gt;http://klabs.org/DEI/Processor/shuttle/shuttle_tech_conf/1985008580.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

==Fleet==
[[File:Shuttle profiles.jpg|thumb|center|upright=1.7|Shuttle launch profiles. From left to right: ''[[Space Shuttle Columbia|Columbia]]'', ''[[Space Shuttle Challenger|Challenger]]'', ''[[Space Shuttle Discovery|Discovery]]'', ''[[Space Shuttle Atlantis|Atlantis]]'', and ''[[Space Shuttle Endeavour|Endeavour]]''.]]

Individual Space Shuttle orbiters were named in honor of antique sailing ships of the navies of the world, and they were also numbered using the NASA [[Orbiter Vehicle Designation]] system. Three of the names had also been borne by Apollo spacecraft between 1969 and 1972: [[Apollo 11]] Command Module ''Columbia'', [[Apollo 15]] Command Module ''Endeavour'', and [[Apollo 17]] Lunar Module ''Challenger''.

While all of the orbiters were externally practically identical, they had minor differences in their interiors. New equipment for the Orbiters was installed in the same order that they underwent maintenance work, and the newer orbiters were constructed by Rockwell International, under NASA supervision, with some more advanced, lighter in weight, structural elements. Thus, the newer orbiters (''Discovery'', ''Atlantis'' and ''Endeavour'') had slightly more cargo capacity than ''Columbia'' or ''Challenger''.

The Space Shuttle orbiters were assembled at Rockwell's assembly facility in [[Palmdale, California]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://science.ksc.nasa.gov/shuttle/technology/sts-newsref/sts_asm.html |title=Orbiter Manufacturing and Assembly |publisher=NASA |quote=Rockwell's Palmdale assembly facility was where all the individual parts, pieces and systems (many of which were built by various subcontractors) came together and were assembled and tested}}&lt;/ref&gt; at the federally owned [[Plant 42]] complex.

'''''Stalin and the Scientists: A History of Triumph and Tragedy 1905–1953''''' is a 2016 [[popular science]] non-fiction book on the history of science in the [[Soviet Union]] under [[Joseph Stalin]] by English novelist and science writer, [[Simon Ings]]. It is Ings' second non-fiction book, the first being ''The Eye: A Natural History'' (2007). He had previously published eight novels.

''Stalin and the Scientists'' was longlisted for the 2016 [[Baillie Gifford Prize|Baillie Gifford Prize for Non-Fiction]].&lt;ref name=bailliegiffordprize/&gt;

==Background==
Ings' inspiration for ''Stalin and the Scientists'' came from Soviet [[psychology|psychologist]], [[Alexander Luria]]'s book ''Mind of a Mnemonist'', about the life of Russian journalist and [[mnemonist]], [[Solomon Shereshevsky]]. Ings said in 2016 interviews that Luria is often referred to as the founder of modern [[neuroanatomy]] and "the godfather of the literary genre we call popular science".&lt;ref name=Hunter/&gt; "Luria's account more or less set the template for modern popular science and ... pretty much set me on the path I'm on now."&lt;ref name=bailliegiffordprize-interview/&gt; Ings had considered writing a biography about Luria, but felt that while Luria's achievements were "extraordinary", considering the climate of [[political repression]] he worked in, Ings was concerned that Western readers would consider his career too ordinary, and would miss the context in which it unfolded.&lt;ref name=Hunter/&gt; Ings' passion for [[popular science]] and the need to explain the context within which Luria and other Soviet scientists worked, changed what would have been a one-year "modest biography" into a "five-year behemoth" that "burned through three editors" and, Ings added, "nearly killed me".&lt;ref name=Hunter/&gt;

Ings said, as a novelist, he was "absurdly under-qualified" to tackle a book like ''Stalin and the Scientists'', but added that only a novelist could be so "ridiculously ambitious" and "naive enough to stick his or her neck out so far".&lt;ref name=bailliegiffordprize-interview/&gt; Ings felt that given the kind of science prevalent in Russia at the time, perhaps this "really has to be the job of a novelist rather than a historian".&lt;ref name=bailliegiffordprize-interview/&gt; Responding to statements that this is "the first history" of Soviet science, Ings said, "Certainly no-one's been foolish enough to attempt to tell the whole story of science under Stalin in a single volume, but be assured I didn't dig this entire thing single-handed from virgin ground."&lt;ref name=bailliegiffordprize-interview/&gt;

==Reception==
In a review in ''[[The Guardian]]'', David Holloway described ''Stalin and the Scientists'' as a "fascinating story" that reveals "the tragedy and the triumph" of Soviet science.&lt;ref name=Holloway/&gt; He called it a "lively book" and complimented Ings on his "clear and simple" scientific explanations, and the way he highlighted the personalities of those involved: the "brilliant scientists", the "charlatans", the "visionaries" and the "careerists".&lt;ref name=Holloway/&gt; A reviewer of the book in ''[[Publishers Weekly]]'' complimented Ings on the sensitive way in which he exposed the lives of the scientists and their experiences, and how he "ably documents the challenges, failures, and achievements of Soviet science".&lt;ref name=PublisherWeekly/&gt; The reviewer commented that while Ings "can be long-winded", he "engagingly fuses history, science, and storytelling".&lt;ref name=PublisherWeekly/&gt;

British historian and author [[Simon Sebag Montefiore]] wrote in ''[[The New York Times]]'' that Ings "skillfully" portrays the lives of the scientists of this period. He called Ings "an entertaining storyteller who often captures the essence of things", and described the book as "lively and interesting" and full of "priceless nuggets and a cast of frauds, crackpots and tyrants".&lt;ref name=Montefiore/&gt; Montefiore added, however, that while Ings highlights the failures of Soviet science, he omits its successes, for example the [[List of Tupolev aircraft|Tupolev]] and [[List of Mikoyan and MiG aircraft|MiG]] airplanes, and the [[T-34]] tank.&lt;ref name=Montefiore/&gt; Montefiore was also critical of errors in the book, for example Stalin's birthday and [[Felix Dzerzhinsky]]'s tenure as head of [[Cheka]], the Soviet secret police.&lt;ref name=Montefiore/&gt;

Writing in ''[[Socialist Review]]'', John Parrington was also critical of flaws and omissions. While he described the book as "ambitious in scope", and called it "fascinating" and "important", Parrington said it is not without "elementary errors", like Ings' statement that "the Bolsheviks ... and the Mensheviks ... missed the 1905 revolution".{{sfn|Ings|2016|loc=Chapter 2: Revolutionaries}}&lt;ref name=Parrington/&gt; Parrington also complained that Ings does not explain what it was that "destroyed the hopes and dreams" of Russian scientists in the 1920s when Stalin came to power.&lt;ref name=Parrington/&gt;

American science historian [[Loren Graham]] also criticised errors and omissions in the book. In a review in ''[[The Wall Street Journal]]'', he said Ings is "a gifted writer", and called ''Stalin and the Scientists'' "a good single source" for readers new to Soviet science.&lt;ref name=Graham/&gt; But Graham felt that one of the book's shortcomings was that Ings only focuses on topics that interest him, like biology, physiology and psychology, while giving little attention to mathematics and theoretical physics. Graham also noted several "incorrect or exaggerated" statements in the book,&lt;ref name=Graham/&gt; for example: [[Aleksei Gastev|Alexei Gastev]] was a "leading architect of Russia's industrialisation programme";{{sfn|Ings|2016|loc=Preface}} [[Nikolai Bernstein]] "invented cybernetics";{{sfn|Ings|2016|loc=Chapter 4: Workers}} and Stalin was "the last in a long line of European philosopher kings".{{sfn|Ings|2016|loc=Chapter 18: 'How did anyone dare insult Comrade Lysenko?'}} Graham concluded that the book is the result of "an impressive amount of study" and "deserves attention", but "a very critical form of attention".&lt;ref name=Graham/&gt;

'''Stefan Marinov''' ({{lang-bg|Стефан Маринов}}) (1 February 1931 – 15 July 1997) was a [[Bulgaria]]n [[physicist]], researcher, writer and lecturer who promoted [[Criticism of the theory of relativity|anti-relativistic theoretical viewpoints]], and later in his life defended the ideas of [[perpetual motion]] and [[Second law of thermodynamics|free energy]]. In 1997 he self-published experimental results that confirmed [[classical electromagnetism]] and disproved that a machine constructed by Marinov himself could be a source of perpetual motion.&lt;ref name="mar1997DPa"/&gt;&lt;ref name="mar1997DPb"/&gt; Devastated by the negative results, he committed suicide&lt;ref name="NEN1997"/&gt; in [[Graz]], [[Austria]] on 15 July 1997.

==Life and education==
Marinov was born on 1 February 1931 in [[Sofia]] to a family of intellectual [[communist]]s.&lt;ref name="Marinov1987"&gt;

In 1948 he finished Soviet College in [[Prague]], then studied [[physics]] at the [[Czech Technical University in Prague]] and [[Sofia University]]. He was an Assistant Professor of Physics from 1960 to 1974 at [[Sofia University]]. In 1966-67, 1974, and 1977 he was subject to compulsory [[Psychiatry|psychiatric]] treatment in Sofia because of his [[political dissent]]. In September 1977 Marinov received a passport and he successfully emigrated out of the country, moving to [[Brussels]]. In 1978, Marinov moved to [[Washington, D.C.]]. Later he lived in [[Italy]] and [[Austria]]. In his later years, Marinov earned a living as a groom for horses.

On 15 July 1997, Marinov jumped to his death from a staircase at a library at the [[University of Graz]], after leaving suicide notes.&lt;ref name="NEN1997"/&gt;  He was 66 years old and was survived by his son Marin Marinov, who at the time was a [[List of ministries of Bulgaria|vice-Minister of Industry of Bulgaria]].

==Work==
One of Marinov's interests was the quest for [[Perpetual motion|free energy]] sources via construction of toy theories (new axiomatic systems that putatively describe our physical reality) and their experimental testing against mainstream physical theories. In 1992 Marinov wrote a letter to German Federal Chancellor [[Helmut Kohl]] in support of a German company, Becocraft, that was doing research into "[[Perpetual motion|free energy]]" technologies and had recently been the target of lawsuits. In the letter, Marinov threatened to set himself on fire at the steps of the [[German parliament]] if Kohl was not willing to intervene in favour of Marinov's associates.

== Research ==

Marinov attempted to find experimental disproof of the theory of relativity by testing the speed of light in different directions using an arrangement of ''coupled mirrors'' and ''coupled shutters''.&lt;ref name="Marinov1983"&gt;

Marinov was involved publicly with many quarrels with [[John Maddox]], the editor of ''[[Nature (journal)|Nature]]'', who refused to print either his papers or his letters to the editor. He retaliated by securing the funds to place a full-page [[advertisement]] in ''Nature'' expressing his frustration with what he regarded as the dogmatic attitude of the establishment.&lt;ref name="Marinov1996"&gt;

'''''Technica Curiosa''''' was an early compendium of scientific and medical technologies.  It was published in 1664 by [[Gaspar Schott]]&lt;ref&gt;Schott, Gaspar, ''Technica curiosa, sive mirabilia artis, libris XII comprehensa,'' Nuremberg, Johann Andreas Endter, 1664&lt;/ref&gt; near the beginning of the [[scientific revolution]].  It contained some of the first accounts of [[Otto von Guericke]]'s experiments with a vacuum.&lt;ref&gt;https://galileo.ou.edu/exhibits/curious-technology&lt;/ref&gt;  One of the first "popular science" publications, the book did much to inspire interest in the sciences.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.technicacuriosa.com &lt;/ref&gt;

During 2017, the title 'Technica Curiosa' is being reused for an online publication with content of a similar nature for a modern audience.  It will incorporate the titles of ''[[Popular Astronomy (US magazine)|Popular Astronomy]]'', ''[[Popular Electronics]]'', and ''[[Mechanix Illustrated]]''.{{cn|date=March 2017}}

'''''The Feynman Lectures on Physics''''' is a [[physics]] [[textbook]] based on some lectures by [[Richard Feynman|Richard P. Feynman]], a Nobel laureate who has sometimes been called "The Great Explainer".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=LeVine |first=Harry |year=2009 |title=The Great Explainer: The Story of Richard Feynman |publisher=Morgan Reynolds |location=Greensboro, North Carolina |isbn=978-1-59935-113-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; The lectures were presented before [[undergraduate student]]s at the [[California Institute of Technology]] (Caltech), during 1961–1963.  The book's co-authors are Feynman, [[Robert B. Leighton]], and [[Matthew Sands]].

''The Feynman Lectures on Physics'' is perhaps the most popular physics book ever written. More than 1.5 million English-language copies have been sold; probably even more copies have been sold in a dozen foreign-language editions.&lt;ref name="FLP"&gt;{{cite web|title=Tales of The Feynman Lectures on Physics|url=http://www.feynmanlectures.info/stories.html|website=www.feynmanlectures.info|accessdate=2012-02-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; A 2013 review in ''[[Nature (journal)|Nature]]'' described the book as having "simplicity, beauty, unity ... presented with enthusiasm and insight".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Phillips|first=Rob|date=2013-12-05|title=In retrospect: The Feynman Lectures on Physics|url=http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v504/n7478/full/504030a.html?foxtrotcallback=true|journal=Nature|language=en|volume=504|issue=7478|pages=30–31|doi=10.1038/504030a|issn=0028-0836|bibcode=2013Natur.504...30P}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Description==
The textbook comprises three volumes.  The first volume focuses on [[mechanics]], [[radiation]], and [[heat]], including [[Special relativity|relativistic effects]]. The second volume covers mainly [[electromagnetism]] and [[matter]]. The third volume covers [[quantum mechanics]]; for example, it shows how the [[double-slit experiment]] demonstrates the essential features of quantum mechanics. The book also includes chapters on the [[relationship between mathematics and physics]], and the relationship of physics to other sciences.

In 2013, Caltech in cooperation with The Feynman Lectures Website made the book freely available, on the web site.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://feynmanlectures.info |title=Website for The Feynman Lectures on Physics New Millennium Edition |first= |last= |date= |website= |accessdate=18 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
[[File:FeynmanLecturesOnPhysics.jpg|thumb|left|Feynman the “Great Explainer”: ''The Feynman Lectures on Physics'' found an appreciative audience beyond the undergraduate community.]]
By 1960, [[Richard Feynman]]’s research and discoveries in physics had resolved a number of troubling inconsistencies in several fundamental theories. In particular, it was his work in [[quantum electrodynamics]] for which [[List of Nobel laureates in Physics|he was awarded]] the 1965  [[List of Nobel laureates in Physics|Nobel Prize in physics]]. At the same time that Feynman was at the pinnacle of his fame, the faculty of the [[Caltech|California Institute of Technology]] was concerned about the quality of the introductory courses for undergraduate students. It was thought the courses were burdened by an old-fashioned syllabus and the exciting discoveries of recent years, many of which had occurred at Caltech, were not being taught to the students.

Thus, it was decided to reconfigure the first physics course offered to students at Caltech, with the goal being to generate more excitement in the students. Feynman readily agreed to give the course, though only once. Aware of the fact that this would be a historic event, Caltech recorded each lecture and took photographs of each drawing made on the blackboard by Feynman.

Based on the lectures and the tape recordings, a team of physicists and graduate students put together a manuscript that would become ''The Feynman Lectures on Physics''. Although Feynman's most valuable technical contribution to the field of physics may have been in the field of quantum electrodynamics, the Feynman Lectures were destined to become his most widely-read work.

''The Feynman Lectures'' are considered to be one of the most sophisticated and comprehensive college-level introductions to physics.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=From paradox to reality: our basic concepts of the physical world|first1=Fritz|last1=Rohrlich|publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=1989|isbn=0-521-37605-X|page=157|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=3TqA1394OVcC}} [https://books.google.com/books?id=3TqA1394OVcC&amp;pg=PA157 Extract of page 157]&lt;/ref&gt; Feynman himself stated in his original preface that he was “pessimistic” with regard to his success in reaching all of his students. The Feynman lectures were written “to maintain the interest of very enthusiastic and rather smart students coming out of high schools and into Caltech”. Feynman was targeting the lectures to students who, “at the end of two years of our previous course, [were] very discouraged because there were really very few grand, new, modern ideas presented to them”. As a result, some physics students find the lectures more valuable after they have obtained a good grasp of physics by studying more-traditional texts, and the books are sometimes seen as more helpful for teachers than for students.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Crease|first=Robert P.|date=2014|title=Feynman's failings|url=http://stacks.iop.org/2058-7058/27/i=03/a=34|journal=Physics World|language=en|volume=27|issue=03|pages=25|doi=10.1088/2058-7058/27/03/34|issn=2058-7058|bibcode=2014PhyW...27c..25C}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While the two-year course (1961–1963) was still underway, rumors of it spread throughout the physics research and teaching community. In a special preface to the 1989 edition, [[David Goodstein]] and [[Gerry Neugebauer]] claimed that as time went on, the attendance of registered undergraduate students dropped sharply but was matched by a compensating increase in the number of faculty and graduate students. Co-author [[Matthew Sands]], in his memoir accompanying the 2005 edition, contested this claim. Goodstein and Neugebauer also stated that, “it was [Feynman’s] peers — scientists, physicists, and professors — who would be the main beneficiaries of his magnificent achievement, which was nothing less than to see physics through the fresh and dynamic perspective of Richard Feynman”, and that his "gift was that he was an extraordinary teacher of teachers".

[[Addison-Wesley]] published a collection of exercises and problems to accompany ''The Feynman Lectures on Physics''. The problem sets were first used in the 1962-1963 academic year, and were organized by [[Robert B. Leighton]]. Some of the problems are sophisticated and difficult enough to require an understanding of advanced topics, such as [[Kolmogorov's zero–one law]]. The original set of books and supplements contained a number of errors, some of which rendered problems insoluble. Various [[errata]] were issued, which are now available online.&lt;ref name="Errata"&gt;{{cite web|title=Errata for The Feynman Lectures on Physics|url=http://www.feynmanlectures.info/flp_errata.html|website=www.feynmanlectures.info|accessdate=2012-02-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Addison–Wesley also released in [[compact disc|CD]] format all the [[audio tape]]s of the lectures, over 103 hours with Richard Feynman, after [[Audio mastering|remastering]] the sound and clearing the recordings. For the CD release, the order of the lectures was rearranged from that of the original texts. The publisher has released a table showing the [http://www.feynmanlectures.info/other/Feynman_lectures_Audio_CD_map.htm correspondence between the books and the CDs].

In March 1964, Feynman appeared once again before the freshman physics class as a lecturer, but the notes for this particular guest lecture were lost for a number of years. They were finally located, restored, and made available as ''[[Feynman's Lost Lecture: The Motion of Planets Around the Sun]]''.

In 2005, Michael A. Gottlieb and [[Ralph Leighton]] co-authored ''Feynman's Tips on Physics'', which includes four of Feynman's freshman lectures which had not been included in the main text (three on [[problem solving]], one on [[inertial guidance]]), a memoir by Matthew Sands about the origins of the ''Feynman Lectures on Physics'', and exercises (with answers) that were assigned to students by Robert B. Leighton and Rochus Vogt in recitation sections of the Feynman Lectures course at Caltech. Also released in 2005, was a "Definitive Edition" of the lectures which included corrections to the original text.

An account of the history of these famous volumes is given by Sands in his memoir article “Capturing the Wisdom of Feynman",&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Sands|first=Matthew|date=2005-04-01|title=Capturing the Wisdom of Feynman|url=http://physicstoday.scitation.org/doi/10.1063/1.1955479|journal=Physics Today|volume=58|issue=4|pages=49–55|doi=10.1063/1.1955479|issn=0031-9228|bibcode=2005PhT....58d..49S}}&lt;/ref&gt; and another article "Memories of Feynman" by the physicist T.

In a September 13, 2013 email to members of the Feynman Lectures online forum, Gottlieb announced the launch of a new [http://www.feynmanlectures.caltech.edu/ website] by Caltech and The Feynman Lectures Website which offers "[A] free high-quality online edition" of the lecture text.

'''''The Origins of Virtue''''' is a 1996 [[popular science]] [[book]] by [[Matt Ridley]], which has been recognised as a classic in its field.&lt;ref name=Kealey&gt;T. Kealey (2000), ''Nature Genetics'', '''24''' (21)&lt;/ref&gt;  In the book, Ridley explores the issues surrounding the development of [[human]] [[morality]]. The book, written from a [[sociobiology|sociobiological]] viewpoint, explores how [[genetics]] can be used to explain certain traits of human behaviour, in particular morality and [[altruism]].

Starting from the premise that society can on a simplistic level be represented as a variant of the [[prisoner's dilemma]], Ridley examines how it has been possible for a society to arise in which people choose to co-operate rather than defect.

Ridley examines the history of different attempts which have been made to explain the fact that humans in society do not defect, looking at various computer generated models which have been used to explain how such behaviour could arise. In particular he looks at systems based on the idea of [[tit for tat]], where members of the group only cooperate with those who also cooperate and exclude those who do not. This allows altruistic behaviour to develop, and causes the optimum solution to the dilemma, to no longer be to defect but instead to cooperate. He applies this to humans and suggests that genes which generated altruistic-tit for tat behaviour would be likely to be passed on and therefore give rise to the kind of behaviour we see today.

From this argument Ridley argues that society operates best in groups of around 150 individuals, which he suggests is the level at which humans are capable of being sure about which members to cooperate with and which to exclude. Although he avoids drawing any specific political points, Ridley ends his book by arguing for a smaller state operating on a more local level.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6023">'''Thermodynamic efficiency limit''' is the absolute maximum theoretically possible [[conversion efficiency]] of [[sunlight]] to [[electricity]]. Its value is about 86%, which is the [[Endoreversible thermodynamics|Chambadal-Novikov efficiency]], an approximation related to the [[Carnot cycle|Carnot limit]], based on the temperature of the [[photon]]s emitted by the Sun's surface.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.intechopen.com/books/solar-cells-new-approaches-and-reviews/theoretical-calculation-of-the-efficiency-limit-for-solar-cells|accessdate=28 November 2016|work=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Effect of band gap energy ==
[[Solar cells]] operate as [[quantum]] [[energy conversion device]]s, and are therefore subject to the thermodynamic efficiency limit. [[Photons]] with an energy below the [[band gap]] of the absorber material cannot generate an [[electron-hole pair]], and so their energy is not converted to useful output and only generates [[heat]] if absorbed. For photons with an energy above the band gap energy, only a fraction of the energy above the band gap can be converted to useful output. When a photon of greater energy is absorbed, the excess energy above the band gap is converted to [[kinetic energy]] of the [[carrier recombination]]. The excess kinetic energy is converted to heat through phonon interactions as the kinetic energy of the carriers slows to equilibrium velocity. Hence, the solar energy cannot be converted to electricity beyond a certain limit.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.me.berkeley.edu/~ndhillon/Publications/PDF/reports/6_organic_solar_cells.pdf|title= Nanostructured Organic Solar Cell|publisher=me.berkeley.edu|accessdate=2011-07-22|work=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Solar cells with multiple band gap absorber materials improve efficiency by dividing the solar spectrum into smaller bins where the thermodynamic efficiency limit is higher for each bin.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title=Limiting efficiencies for multiple energy-gap quantum devices| author=Cheng-Hsiao Wu and Richard Williams|doi=10.1063/1.331859|journal=J.

== Efficiency limits for different solar cell technologies ==
Thermodynamic efficiency limits for different solar cell technologies are as follows: 
* Single junctions ≈ 31%
* 3-cell stacks and impure PVs ≈ 50%
* Hot carrier- or impact ionization-based devices ≈ 54-68%
* Commercial modules are ≈ 12-21%
* Solar cell with an upconverter for operation in the AM1.5 spectrum and with a 2eV bandgap ≈ 50.7%&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://gcep.stanford.edu/pdfs/assessments/solar_assessment.pdf|title= An Assessment of Solar Energy Conversion Technologies and Research Opportunities|publisher=gcep.stanford.edu|accessdate=2011-07-22|work=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Thermodynamic efficiency limits with carrier multiplication ==
[[Carrier multiplication]] facilitates multiple [[electron-hole pair]] generation for each photon absorbed. Efficiency limits for photovoltaic cells can be theoretically higher considering thermodynamic effects. For a solar cell powered by the Sun's unconcentrated [[black body radiation]], the theoretical maximum efficiency is 43% whereas for a solar cell powered by the Sun's full concentrated radiation, the efficiency limit is up to 85%. These high values of efficiencies are possible only when the solar cells use [[radiative recombination]] and carrier multiplication.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Brendel|first1=Rolf|last2=Werner|first2=Jürgen H.|last3= Queisser|first3=Hans J.|year=1996|title=Thermodynamic efficiency limits for semiconductor solar cells with carrier multiplication|journal=Solar Energy Materials and Solar Cells|publisher=Elsevier|doi=10.1016/0927-0248(95)00125-5|issn=0927-0248|url=http://www.mendeley.com/research/thermodynamic-efficiency-limits-semiconductor-solar-cells-carrier-multiplication/|accessdate=2011-07-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Two in the Far North''''' is a [[biographical novel]] written by [[Margaret Murie]]. Raised in [[Fairbanks, Alaska|Fairbanks]], in the [[United States|U.S.]] state of [[Alaska]], and wife and companion of the biologist [[Olaus Murie]], she tells the tale of their lives spent first living, then exploring and finally fighting for the preservation of the final wilderness frontiers of Alaska.

The book is divided into sections covering her childhood in the northernmost state (including the beginning of rail travel), her honeymoon in the unexplored wilds, later biological survey expeditions (with members including her husband and small baby) and finally her whirlwind trips back to Alaska from her home in Wyoming.

In biology, a '''whorl''' is a cluster of cells or tissue that surrounds another and wraps around another in an expanding circular pattern.  Whorls occur at the ends of different structures or in the middle of structures. Structures of some organs are often described as whorls and used in the aid of identification.

The [[Hassall's corpuscle]], formed from type VI [[epithelial]] [[reticular]] cells in the [[thymus]], is an example of a whorl-shaped structure.

E. and R. L. Winstead, 1980. Estimating the numbers of wildlife populations. Pp. 221-247. In S.D. Schemnitz (editor). Wildlife Management and Techniques Manual. The Wildlife Society,Washington, D.C.&lt;/ref&gt; The process of scientific wildlife observation includes the reporting of what ([[diagnosis]] of the species), where ([[geographical location]]), when (date and time), who (details about observer), and why (reason for observation, or explanations for occurrence). Wildlife observation can be performed if the animals are alive, with the most notable example being face-to-face observation and live cameras, or are dead, with the primary example being the notifying of where roadkill has occurred. This outlines the basic information needed to collect data for a wildlife observation; which can also contribute to scientific investigations of distribution, habitat relations, trends, and movement of wildlife species. One example of this type of activity is [[birdwatching|bird watching.]] Wildlife observation allows for the study of organisms with minimal disturbance to their ecosystem depending on the type of method or equipment used. The use of equipment such as unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), more commonly known as drones, may disturb and cause negative impacts on wildlife.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Hodgson|first=Jarrod C.|last2=Koh|first2=Lian Pin|date=2016-05-23|title=Best practice for minimising unmanned aerial vehicle disturbance to wildlife in biological field research|journal=Current Biology|volume=26|issue=10|pages=R404–405|doi=10.1016/j.cub.2016.04.001|issn=1879-0445|pmid=27218843}}&lt;/ref&gt; Specialized equipment can be used to collect more accurate data.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.fws.gov/policy/605fw4.html|title=605 FW 4, Wildlife Observation, Fish and Wildlife Service Manual, U.S.  Fish and Wildlife Service|website=www.fws.gov|access-date=2016-09-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Importance==
Through wildlife observation, there are many important details that can be discovered about the environment. For instance, if a fisher in Taiwan discovers that a certain species of fish he/she frequently catches is becoming rarer and rarer, there might be a substantial issue in the water that fisher is fishing in. It could be that there is a new predator in the water that has changed the [http://nationalgeographic.org/encyclopedia/food-chain/ animal food chain], a source of pollution, or perhaps even a larger problem. Regardless of the reason, this process of observing animals can help identify potential issues before they become severe problems in the world.

Additionally, through animal observation, those who participate are also actively participating in the conservation of animal life. Oftentimes, the two subjects go hand-in-hand with one another because through the observation of animals, individuals are also discovering what issues animals around the world are currently facing and if there are any ways to put up a fight against them.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://globalwildlife.org|title=Global Wildlife Conservation|website=globalwildlife.org|access-date=2016-12-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; With more observation, fewer species of animals will become extinct.

==Research==
Before one can get started observing wildlife and helping the environment, it is important to research the animal they are choosing to observe. If one simply went into the observation process and skipped the crucial process of obtaining knowledge about the animals, it would be difficult for them to determine if anything was out of the ordinary.&lt;ref name="How to Watch Wildlife"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.wikihow.com/Watch-Wildlife|title=How to Watch Wildlife|newspaper=wikiHow|access-date=2016-12-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; Before observing, it would be wise to find out simple information about the animal such as:
* What the animal eats - Is the animal a carnivore, herbivore, or omnivore?
* What animals prey on the animal?
* Where does the animal live?
* Is the animal dangerous?
* Is it endangered?
* Does the animal travel in packs or alone?
* What are the animal's sleeping habits? &lt;ref name="How to Watch Wildlife"/&gt;

==Projects and programs devoted to wildlife observation==

===Projects===
There are a variety of projects and websites devoted to wildlife observations. One of the most common projects are for bird observations (for example: [http://ebird.org e-bird]). For those who enjoy bird watching, there are a variety of ways one can contribute to this type of wildlife observation. The National Wildlife Refuge System has volunteer opportunities, citizen science projects, and if one is limiting in time; could purchase a Federal Duck Stamp that donates money to the wildlife refuge lands.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.fws.gov/refuges/birding/getinvolved.html|title=Get Involved {{!}} National Wildlife Refuge System|last=System|first=National Wildlife Refuge|website=www.fws.gov|language=en|access-date=2017-05-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the past few years, websites dedicated to reporting wildlife across broad taxonomic ranges have become available. For example, the [http://www.wildlifecrossing.net/california California Roadkill Observation System] provides a mechanism for citizen-scientists in California to report wildlife species killed by vehicles. The [http://www.wildlifecrossing.net/maine Maine Audubon Wildlife Road Watch] allows reporting of observations of both dead and live animals along roads. A more recent addition to wildlife observation tools are the web sites that facilitate uploading and management of images from remote wildlife cameras. For example, the [[Smithsonian Institution]] supports the [http://eMammal.wordpress.com eMammal] and [http://siwild.si.edu Smithsonian Wild] programs, which provide a mechanism for volunteer deployment of wildlife cameras around the world.  Similarly, the [http://wildlifeobserver.net Wildlife Observer Network] hosts over a dozen wildlife-camera projects from around the world, providing tools and a database to manage photographs and camera networks.

===Monitoring programs===
Monitoring programs for wildlife utilize new and easier ways to monitor animal species for citizen scientists and research scientists alike. One such monitoring device is the automated recorder. Automated recorders are a reliable way to monitor species such as bird, bats, and amphibians as they provide ability to save and independently identify a specific animal call.&lt;ref name="Furnas"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Furnas|first1=Brett J.|title=Using Automated Recorders and Occupancy Models to Monitor Common Forest Birds Across a Large Geographic Region|journal=Journal of Wildlife Management|date=February 2015|volume= 79|pages=pp.&amp;nbsp;325–337.|doi=10.1002/jwmg.821}}&lt;/ref&gt; The automated recorder analyzes the sounds of the species to identify the species and how many there are.&lt;ref name="Furnas" /&gt; It was found that using the automated recorders produced larger quantity and even more quality data when compared with traditional, point-count data recording.&lt;ref name="Acevedo"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Acevedo|first1=Miguel A.and |last2=Villanueva-Rivera|first2=Luis J.|title=Using Automated Digital Recording Systems as Effective Tools for the Monitoring of Birds and Amphibians|journal=Wildlife Society Bulletin|date=2006|volume= 34 | issue = 1 |pages=pp.&amp;nbsp;211–214. |doi=10.2193/0091-7648(2006)34[211:uadrsa]2.0.co;2}}&lt;/ref&gt; While providing better quality, it also provides a permanent record of the census which can be continually reviewed for any potential bias.&lt;ref name="Acevedo" /&gt; This monitoring device can improve wildlife observation and potentially save more animals. Using this device can allow for continued tracking of populations, continued censusing of individuals within a species, and allow for faster population size estimates.&lt;ref name="Furnas" /&gt;

==Live watching and observation==

===Birdwatching===
One of the most popular forms of wildlife observation, [[birdwatching]], is typically performed as a recreational pleasure. Those looking to birdwatch typically travel into a forest or other wooded area with a pair of binoculars in hand to aid the process. Birdwatching has become all the more important with the amount of deforestation that has been occurring in the world. Birds are arguably the most important factor in the balance of environmental [[system]]s: "They pollinate plants, disperse seeds, scavenge carcasses and recycle nutrients back into the earth."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.audubon.org/magazine/march-april-2013/why-do-birds-matter|title=Why Do Birds Matter?|date=2013-03-06|newspaper=Audubon|access-date=2016-11-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; A decrease in the total number of birds would cause destruction to much of the environmental system. The plants and trees around the world would die at an alarming rate which would, in turn, set off a chain reaction that would cause many other animals to die due to the environment change and [[Habitat destruction|habitat loss]]. 
[[File:Birdwatching on beach.jpg|thumb|244x244px|Birdwatchers on a beach]]

One of the ways that birdwatching has an effect on the environment as a whole is that through consistent birdwatching, an observer would be able to identify whether they are seeing less of a certain species of bird. If this happens, there typically is a reasons for the occurrence, whether it be because of an increase in pollution in the area or possibly an increase in the population of predators.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://birding.about.com/od/birdconservation/a/importconserve.htm|title=bird wildlife conservation protect protection conserve environment|newspaper=About.com Home|access-date=2016-11-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; If a watcher were to take notice of a change in what they typically see, they could notify the city or park and allow them to investigate into the cause a bit further. Through this action, birdwatchers are preserving the future for both animal and human life.

Subsequently, by taking children birdwatching it is allowing the future generation to understand the importance of animal observation. If children learn at a young age how the environmental system works and that all life is intertwined, the world will be in much better hands.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; These children will be the ones pioneer conservation movements and attempt to protect the habit for all animals.

===Livestreams===
Live streams of animal exhibits at various zoos and aquariums across the United States have also become extremely popular. The [[Tennessee Aquarium]] has a webcam that allows online viewers to take a look into the happening so their Secret Reef exhibit which consists of reef fish, sharks, and a rescued green sea turtle.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.tnaqua.org/animals-exhibits/secret-reef-cam/|title=Secret Reef Cam {{!}} Tennessee Aquarium|last=Aquarium|first=Tennessee|website=www.tnaqua.org|access-date=2016-10-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Perhaps the most popular animals cams in the United States though come from, naturally, the largest zoo in the United States: [[San Diego Zoo|The San Diego Zoo]]. The San Diego Zoo features eight live cams on their website – A panda, elephant, ape, penguin, polar bear, tiger, condor, and koala. The purpose of the live streams is to help educate the public about the behaviors of several different animals and to entertain those who might not be able to travel to a zoo.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://zoo.sandiegozoo.org/content/video-more|title=Video &amp; More|date=2013-12-03|newspaper=San Diego Zoo|access-date=2016-10-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The other notable zoos that have webcams are the [[National Zoological Park (United States)|National Zoo]], [[Woodland Park Zoo]], [[Houston Zoo]], and [[Zoo Atlanta|Atlanta Zoo]].

Additionally, the [[National Museum of Natural History|Smithsonian National Museum of Natural History]] has opened a butterfly and plant observation pavilion. Visitors walk into a large tent and experience a one-of-a-kind situation in which hundreds of rare butterflies from all across the world are inches from their faces.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://naturalhistory.si.edu/butterflies/|title=Butterflies + Plants: Partners in Evolution, Home Page|website=naturalhistory.si.edu|access-date=2016-10-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Collecting data===
As is the case with a majority of subjects, one of the best and most effective ways to observe live animals is through data collection. This process can be done through a livestream or in the wild but it is more useful if the data is collected on animals that are in currently in the wild.&lt;ref name="study.com"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://study.com/academy/lesson/how-to-observe-measure-describe-animal-behavior.html|title=How to Observe, Measure &amp; Describe Animal Behavior {{!}} Study.com|newspaper=Study.com|access-date=2016-12-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ways the data can be collected are endless and it really just depends on what purpose an individual has as to what data would be the most useful.

For example, if someone is interested in how deer interact with other animals in a certain location, it would be beneficial for them to take notes and record all of the animals that are native to the area where the deer are located. From there, they can describe any scenarios in which the deer had a positive or negative interaction with the other species of animals. In this instance, it would not really be helpful for the observer to collect data pertaining to the types of food the deer eat because the study is only focusing on the interaction amongst animals.

Another example of how collecting data on wildlife would be useful is keeping track of the total number of a certain species exists within a forest. Naturally, it will be impossible to get a definitive number but if an accurate approximation can be made, it could be beneficial in determining if there has been a random increase or decrease in the population. If there is an increase, it could be due to a change in the species migration habits and if there is a decrease, it could be due to an external factor such as pollution or introduction of a new predator.&lt;ref name="study.com"/&gt;

===Online systems and mobile apps===
Many states have already begun to set up websites and systems for the public. The main purpose behind the movement is so that they can notify other individuals about [[Roadkill|road-killed]] wildlife. If enough people fill out the forms located on the websites, the government will become notified that there have been occurrences of a loss of animal life and will take the steps required to prevent it. Typically, the step that is taken is the posting of a wildlife crossing sign that, in turn, allows the public to know where there are common animal crossings. Maine and California are the states that have been the pioneers of this movement and this process has become particularly important on heavily traveled roads as no one would like endanger the animals or themselves.&lt;ref name="wildlifecrossing.net|title=wildlifecrossing.net"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.wildlifecrossing.net|title=wildlifecrossing.net {{!}} wildlife observation reporting|website=www.wildlifecrossing.net|access-date=2016-10-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Currently, there is an app (available on both iPhone and Android devices) made specifically for the purpose of identifying road-kill called [https://www.herpmapper.org/mobile/mapper “Mobile Mapper.”] The app is a partner of the HerpMapper website. The purpose of the website is to use the user recorded observations for research and conservation purposes.&lt;ref name="wildlifecrossing.net|title=wildlifecrossing.net"/&gt;

On average, the cost of repairing a car that has been damaged by a deer or other medium to large-sized animal is $2,000.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.hcn.org/issues/291/15268|title=Roadkill statistics|access-date=2016-11-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; Even though there is no way that accidents involving animals can completely be prevented, placing more signs about possible animal crossings zones would cause drivers to drive more carefully and therefore have fewer accidents. Economically, this means that more families will be saving money and it could be used in a different way to help contributed to society as a whole.

==Issues leading to the extinction of animals==

===Climate change===
[[Climate change]] is one of the most heavily discussed topics around the world today, both politically and scientifically. The climate that Earth is currently experiencing has been steadily changing over time due to both natural causes and human exploitation.&lt;ref name="Media"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.climateandweather.net/global-warming/climate-change-and-animals.html|title=Climate change - effects on animals|last=Media|first=Ali Penman {{!}} Web Smart|website=www.climateandweather.net|access-date=2016-12-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; Climate change has the potential to be detrimental to wildlife across the world, whether that be through rising sea levels, changes in temperatures through the years, or [[deforestation]].&lt;ref name="Media"/&gt; These are just a few of the examples of the contributing factors to climate change.

Climate change is not something that citizens can entirely prevent from happening even if they wanted to. There are many natural causes such as [[Volcano|volcanic activity]] and the Earth's orbit around the sun that are strong contributing factors to the phenomena.&lt;ref name="Canada"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.climatechange.gc.ca/default.asp?lang=En&amp;n=65CD73F4-1|title=climatechange.gc.ca - Facts on Climate Change - Causes of Climate Change|last=Canada|first=Government of Canada, Environment and Climate Change|website=www.climatechange.gc.ca|access-date=2016-12-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are, however, prevention measures that can be taken to prevent climate change from happening as quickly. The primary way to prevent climate change is for society to reduce the amount of [[greenhouse gas]]es that are present in the atmosphere.&lt;ref name="Canada"/&gt; This can be done through the improving of energy efficiency in many buildings, the stoppage of deforestation so more carbon dioxide can be removed from the atmosphere, and mode switching.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://cehtp.org/faq/climate_change/preventing_and_preparing_for_climate_change|title=Climate Change|website=cehtp.org|access-date=2016-12-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Rising sea levels====
One of the more notable effects climate change has on the environment is the rising of sea levels around the world. Over the past 100 years, the sea level has risen approximately 1.8 millimeters each year.&lt;ref name="actforlibraries.org"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.actforlibraries.org/the-impact-of-rising-sea-levels-on-animal-life/|title=The Impact of Rising Sea Levels on Animal Life {{!}} Actforlibraries.org|website=www.actforlibraries.org|access-date=2016-12-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; The steady rise in sea levels can be attributed to the steadily increasing temperatures the Earth faces each year which causes the ice caps and glaciers to melt.&lt;ref name="actforlibraries.org"/&gt; This increase in sea level is detrimental to the [[Coast|coastal ecosystems]] that exist around the world.
[[File:Polar bear after unlucky hunt for a seal.jpg|thumb|Polar bear hunting for food]]
The increase in sea level causes flooding on coastal wetlands, where certain animals will be unable to survive due to [http://eden.cce.cornell.edu/disasters/Documents/PDFs/saltwater%20innundation%20fact%20sheet.pdf saltwater inundation].&lt;ref name="actforlibraries.org"/&gt; The increase in the total amount of saltwater present in these wetlands could prove to be problematic for many species. While some may simply have to migrate to other areas, smaller ecosystems within the wetlands could be destroyed which, once again, influences the animal food chain.&lt;ref name="actforlibraries.org"/&gt;

[[Polar bear]]s are animals that are specifically affected through the process of rising sea levels. Living near the Arctic region, polar bears find their food on ice caps and sheets of ice. As these sheets continue to become fewer in quantity, it is predicted that the polar bears will have a difficult time sustaining life and that by the year 2050, there could be less than 20,000 on Earth.&lt;ref name="actforlibraries.org"/&gt;

[[Coral reef]]s are the primary ecosystem that would be affected through a continuing increase in the sea level:&lt;blockquote&gt;"The coral reef ecosystem is adapted to thrive within certain temperature and sea level range. Corals live in a symbiotic relationship with photosynthetic [[zooxanthellae]]. Zooxanthellae need the sunlight in order to produce the nutrients necessary for the coral. Sea level rise may cause a decrease in solar radiation at the sea surface level, affecting the ability of photosynthetic zooxanthellae to produce nutrients for the coral, whereas, a sudden exposure of the coral reef to the atmosphere due to a low tide event may induce coral bleaching."&lt;ref name="actforlibraries.org"/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
[[File:Coral reefs with fishes.JPG|thumb|Coral reef with fish]]
The loss of coral would have a subsequent effect on the total number of fish that exist within these ecosystems. In the Indo-Pacific coral reefs alone, there are in-between 4000 and 5000 different species of fish that have a relationship with the species of coral.&lt;ref name="eatlas.org.au"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://eatlas.org.au/content/relationship-between-corals-and-fishes-great-barrier-reef|title=Relationship between corals and fishes on the Great Barrier Reef {{!}} eAtlas|website=eatlas.org.au|access-date=2016-12-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; Specifically, the numerous different species of [[Butterflyfish|butterfly fish]] that feed on coral within these reefs would be affected if the coral was unable to live due to an increase in sea level.&lt;ref name="eatlas.org.au"/&gt; Referring back to the food chain topic, this would then subsequently but directly affect species of snappers, eels, and sharks that use butterfly fish as a primary source of food.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://a-z-animals.com/animals/butterfly-fish/|title=Butterfly Fish (Chaetodontidae) - Animals - A-Z Animals - Animal Facts, Information, Pictures, Videos, Resources and Links|last=A-Z-Animals.com|website=a-z-animals.com|access-date=2016-12-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; If the snappers cannot find any butterfly fish to eat because the butterfly fish are dying due to the lack of coral, it means that the snapper population will decrease as well.

The rising of sea level has the possibility to be catastrophic to the coastal ecosystems.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.epa.gov/climate-impacts/climate-impacts-coastal-areas|title=Climate Impacts on Coastal Areas|last=EPA,OA|first=US|website=www.epa.gov|language=en|access-date=2016-12-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Pollution===
[[Pollution]] is another crucial threat to animal life, and human life, across the world. Every form of pollution has an effect on wildlife, whether it be through the air, water, or ground. While sometimes the origin and form of pollution is visible and easy to determine, other times it can be a mystery as to what exactly is causing the death of animals. Through constant and consistent observation of habitat analysis, humans can help prevent the loss of animal life by recognizing the early signs of pollution before the problem becomes too large.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.worldwildlife.org/threats/pollution|title=Pollution {{!}} Threats {{!}} WWF|website=World Wildlife Fund|access-date=2016-12-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Ocean and water pollution====
[[File:Deepwater Horizon oil spill fishing closure map 2010-06-02.png|thumb|Map of the area where fishing was affected because of the BP oil spill]]
Pollution can enter bodies of water in many different ways - Through toxic runoff from pesticides and fertilizers, containers of oil and other hazardous materials falling off of ships, or just from debris  from humans that has not been picked up.&lt;ref name="Pollution {{!}} Threats {{!}} WWF"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.worldwildlife.org/threats/pollution|title=Pollution {{!}} Threats {{!}} WWF|website=World Wildlife Fund|access-date=2016-12-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; No matter what the form of pollution is, the effects water pollution has on animal life can be drastic. For example, the [[Deepwater Horizon oil spill|BP oil spill]] which occurred in 2010 impacted over 82,000 birds, 6,000 sea turtles, approximately 26,000 marine animals, and hundreds of thousands of fish.&lt;ref name="A Deadly Toll"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.biologicaldiversity.org/programs/public_lands/energy/dirty_energy_development/oil_and_gas/gulf_oil_spill/a_deadly_toll.html|title=A Deadly Toll|website=www.biologicaldiversity.org|access-date=2016-12-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While the observation of how animal life was and has been affected by this spill is unique and definitely on the larger scale, it still represents an accurate depiction of how observation can be crucial to animal lives. For example, by observing that a certain species of sea turtle was affected by the oil spill, zoologists and their teams would be able to determine the effects the loss of that sea turtle would have.&lt;ref name="A Deadly Toll"/&gt;

Another prominent example is how if one day a fisherman goes to a lake that he/she frequently visits and notices two or three dead fish on the surface. Knowing that that frequently does not happen, the fisherman tells his local city officials and park rangers about the occurrence and they find out that a farmer has been using a new pesticide that runs off into the lake. By simply observing what is common and what is not, the effects of some water pollution can be stopped before becoming too severe.

====Air pollution====
[[File:Pollution de l'air.jpg|thumb|Smoke coming from a factory]]
Air pollution is commonly associated with the image of billowing clouds of smoke rising into the sky from a large factory. While the fumes and smoke previously stated definitely is a prominent form of air pollution, it is not the only one. Air pollution can come from the emission of cars, smoking, and other sources.&lt;ref name="Pollution {{!}} Threats {{!}} WWF"/&gt; Air pollution does not just affect birds though, like one may have thought. Air pollution affects mammals, birds, reptiles, and any other organism that requires oxygen to live.&lt;ref name="Pollution {{!}} Threats {{!}} WWF"/&gt; Frequently, if there is any highly dangerous air pollution, the animal observation process will be rather simple: There will be an abundance of dead animals located near the vicinity of the pollution.

The primary concern of air pollution is how widespread the pollution can become in a short period of time. [[Acid rain]] is one of the largest forms of pollution today. The issue with acid rain is that it affects literally every living organism it comes in contact with, whether that be trees in a forest, water in an ocean or lake, or the skin of humans and animals.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.climateandweather.net/world-weather/acid-rain.html|title=Acid Rain|last=Media|first=Ali Penman {{!}} Web Smart|website=www.climateandweather.net|access-date=2016-12-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; Typically, acid rain is a combination of sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxides that are emitted from factories.&lt;ref name="Pollution {{!}} Threats {{!}} WWF"/&gt; If it is not controlled in a timely manner, it could lead to loss of life due to the dangerous nature of the composition of the rain.

===Deforestation===
Deforestation has become one of the most prevalent issues environmentally. With an continuously growing population and not having the space to contain all the humans on Earth, forests are frequently the first areas that are cleared to make more room.&lt;ref name="Society"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://environment.nationalgeographic.com/environment/global-warming/deforestation-overview/|title=Deforestation Facts, Deforestation Information, Effects of Deforestation - National Geographic|last=Society|first=National Geographic|newspaper=National Geographic|access-date=2016-12-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to National Geographic, forests still cover approximately 30 percent of the land on Earth but each year large portions are cleared.&lt;ref name="Society"/&gt;

With deforestation, there are numerous subsequent side effects. Most notably, the clearing of entire forests (in some instances) destroys the habitat for hundreds of species of animals and 70 percent of the animals that reside in the forest will die as a result.&lt;ref name="Society"/&gt; Additionally, deforestation causes a reduction in the total [[Canopy (biology)|canopy cover]] which leads to more extreme temperature swings on the ground level because there are no branches and leaves to catch the sun's rays.&lt;ref name="Society"/&gt;

The way to combat the severe effects on the loss of animal life would be to stop cutting trees and forests down. While this is unlikely and almost impossible to happen, there is another solution: the partial removal of forests. By only removing portions of the forest, it keeps the environment of the entire forest in tact which allows the animals to adapt to their surroundings.&lt;ref name="Society"/&gt; Additionally, it is recommended that for every tree that is cut down that another one be planted elsewhere in the forest.&lt;ref name="Society"/&gt;

==Economic effects of animal observation==

===Costs of observation===
Typically, the costs of animal observation are minuscule. As previously stated, animal observation can be done on a small or large scale; it just depends what goal an individual has in mind. For example, animal observation can be performed in the backyard of a house or at a local state park at no charge. All one would have to do is take a notepad, phone, or other device to write down their data and observations. On a larger scale, animal observation could be performed at an animal reserve, where the associated costs would be those associated with keeping the animals happy inside the reserve.

While it is impossible to pinpoint exactly how much the zoos across the world spend on live streaming, it is estimated to be in the $1,000 range for every camera that is set up.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://livestream.com/platform/pricing|title=Livestream {{!}} Plans &amp; Pricing|website=Livestream|access-date=2016-12-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Costs that observation prevents===
Referring back to the example from the "Deceased Wildlife Observation" section, it becomes apparent how animal observation can save families and the government money. With the average cost of repairing a car that has damage from a large sized animal being $2,000, families and the government could save money by making the public aware that they should proceed with caution in areas where animals have been hit.&lt;ref name="Roadkill statistics"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.hcn.org/issues/291/15268|title=Roadkill statistics|access-date=2016-12-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Pollution in Maracaibo lake.jpg|thumb|298x298px|Water pollution at Maracaibo lake]]
Additionally, approximately $44 million of the $4.3 billion spent on water purity is spent each year on protecting aquatic species from nutrient pollution.&lt;ref name="Roadkill statistics"/&gt; It is encouraging that the government is willing to spend the money to help save animals' lives, sometimes the effects of the pollution take effect before they are able to stop them entirely.  One million seabirds and hundred thousand aquatic mammals and fish that are killed as a result of water pollution each year and that has its economic effects, both directly and indirectly.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.dosomething.org/us/facts/11-facts-about-pollution|title=11 Facts About Pollution {{!}} DoSomething.org {{!}} Volunteer for Social Change|website=www.dosomething.org|access-date=2016-12-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Directly, the loss of aquatic mammals and fish has a direct impact on the sales of food. The EPA estimated recently that the effects of pollution cost the fishing industry tens of millions of dollars in sales.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.epa.gov/nutrientpollution/effects-economy|title=The Effects: Economy|last=EPA,OW,OWOW|first=US|website=www.epa.gov|language=en|access-date=2016-12-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; Indirectly, the loss of birds causes humans to spend more money on pest control because the food chain is out of order.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.whatdobirdseat.info|title=What do Birds Eat?|website=www.whatdobirdseat.info|access-date=2016-12-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; The small rodents and insects that some birds prey upon are no longer being killed if the birds die. This means more of these pests find their ways into homes which causes more people to call exterminators, therefore setting off a chain reaction. The exterminators then must use insecticides to kill the animals which can have harmful runoff into the ground and local water systems, instead of allowing it to be done naturally by the animal food chain.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.toxicsaction.org/problems-and-solutions/pesticides|title=The Problem with Pesticides {{!}} Toxics Action Center|website=www.toxicsaction.org|access-date=2016-12-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;
