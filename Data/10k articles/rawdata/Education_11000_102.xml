{{Campaignbox Bangladesh Liberation War}}
In 1971 the [[Pakistan Army]] and their local collaborators, most notably the extreme right wing [[Islamist]] militia groups [[Al-Badr (East Pakistan)|Al-Badr]], engaged in the systematic execution of [[Bengali people|Bengali]] pro-liberation intellectuals during the [[Bangladesh liberation war]] of 1971, a [[war crime]]. Intellectuals were killed during the entire duration of the war. The largest number of executions took place on 25 March and 14 December 1971, as it became apparent that Bangladesh would become independent. 14 December is commemorated in Bangladesh as [[Martyred Intellectuals Day]].

== Black Night of 25 March ==
{{Expand section|date=December 2015}}

At the beginning of [[Operation Searchlight]], on the night of 25 March 1971, a number of professors from [[Dhaka University]] were killed.&lt;ref&gt;Annual Report: Dhaka University 1971–72, Dr. Mafijullah Kabir&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Blood"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.state.gov/documents/organization/48049.pdf |title=Telegram 978 From the Consulate General in Dacca to the Department of State, March 29, 1971, 1130Z |website=US Department of State |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090808144647/http://www.state.gov/documents/organization/48049.pdf |archive-date=8 August 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Reason behind the killing ==
Since the establishment of the State of [[Pakistan]], the rulers of West Pakistan discriminated against citizens of East Pakistan and denied them civil and political rights.{{citation needed|date=December 2015}} The discrimination was visible in all disciplines and the attack on the language and culture was direct. As a result, the discontent and anger in the minds of Bengalis turned to political and cultural protests and these movements were led by intellectuals from all parts of the society. They encouraged and seeded the idea of nationalism in the heart of Bengalis through social and cultural activities. As a result of their cultural movement, the people of East Pakistan (now Bangladesh) gradually became aware of their rights which turned the movement towards political protests.&lt;ref&gt;মুনতাসীর মামুন। । প্রকাশক: সময় প্রকাশন। আইএসবিএন 984-458-202-4।&lt;/ref&gt;

== 14 December executions ==
[[File:Dead bodies of Bengali intellectuals, 14 December 1971.jpg|thumbnail|Dead bodies of Bengali intellectuals found on 15 December 1971]]

As the war neared its end, a final effort to wipe off as many intellectuals as possible took place, mostly planned between 12 and 14 December to eliminate the future leaders of the new nation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Hensher|first=Philip|title=The war Bangladesh can never forget|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/asia/the-war-bangladesh-can-never-forget-8501636.html|newspaper=The Independent|date=19 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 14 December 1971, over 200 of East Pakistan's intellectuals including professors, journalists, doctors, artists, engineers, and writers were picked up from their homes in Dhaka by the Al-Badr militias and Pakistani Army. Notable novelist [[Shahidullah Kaiser]] and playwright [[Munier Choudhury]] were among the victims. They were taken blindfolded to torture cells in Mirpur, Mohammadpur, [[Nakhalpara]], Rajarbagh and other locations in different sections of the city. Later they were executed en masse, most notably at Rayerbazar and Mirpur. In memory of the martyred intellectuals, 14 December is mourned in Bangladesh as Shaheed Buddhijibi Dibosh [[Day of the Martyred Intellectuals]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.newstoday.com.bd/index.php?option=details&amp;news_id=2331520&amp;date=2012-12-14 | title=DU set to observe Martyred Intellectuals Day, Victory Day | publisher=[[The News Today (India)|The News Today]] | accessdate=14 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is widely speculated that the killings of 14 December was orchestrated by Maj Gen [[Rao Farman Ali]]. After the liberation of Bangladesh a list of Bengali intellectuals (most of whom were executed on 14 Dec) was discovered in a page of his diary left behind at the Governor's House. The existence of such a list was confirmed by Ali himself although he denied the motive of genocide. The same was also confirmed by Altaf Gauhar, a former Pakistani bureaucrat. He mentioned an incident in which Altaf requested Ali to delete a friend's name from the list and Ali did that in front of him.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last= Mamoon, Muntassir |author2= translation by Kushal Ibrahim |title= The Vanquished Generals and the Liberation War of Bangladesh |publisher= Somoy Prokashon |date=June 2000 | edition = First  |isbn= 984-458-210-5| page = 29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Verdict on the killing ==
On 3 November 2013, a Special Court in Dhaka has sentenced two former leaders of the al-Badr killing squad to death for war crimes committed during Bangladesh's war of liberation in 1971. [[Chowdhury Mueen-Uddin]], a Muslim leader based in London, and [[Ashrafuz Zaman Khan]], based in the US, were sentenced in absentia after the court found that they were involved in the abduction and murders of 18 intellectuals – nine Dhaka University professors, six journalists and three physicians – in December 1971. Prosecutors said the killings were carried out between 10 and 15 December, when Pakistan was losing the war in Bangladesh (then East Pakistan), and were part of a campaign intended to strip the newborn nation of its intellectuals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=UK Muslim leader Chowdhury Mueen Uddin sentenced to death in Bangladesh|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/asia/uk-muslim-leader-chowdhury-mueen-uddin-sentenced-to-death-in-bangladesh-8919895.html|newspaper=The Independent|date=3 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 2 November 2014 [[International Crimes Tribunal (Bangladesh)|International Crimes Tribunal, Bangladesh]] sentenced [[Mir Quasem Ali]] to death for war crimes which include the killings of intellectuals. It was proved in the tribunal that he was a key organiser of the [[Al-Badr (East Pakistan)|Al-Badr]], which planned and executed the killing of the intellectuals on 14 December 1971.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Bangladesh Islamist party leader files appeal against death penalty|url=http://www.shanghaidaily.com/article/article_xinhua.aspx?id=255697|accessdate=14 December 2014|work=[[Shanghai Daily]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=War trial: Mir Quasem verdict Sunday |url=http://www.thedailystar.net/war-trial-mir-quasem-verdict-sunday-48077 |newspaper=[[The Daily Star (Bangladesh)|The Daily Star]] |date=30 October 2014 |accessdate=14 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Biography ==
Rogers spent her whole life advocating for the admittance of women into Michigan universities. In September 1855, she founded the Michigan Women's College in [[Lansing, Michigan]] with Delia Rogers and pioneer James Turner&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Dunbar|first1= Willis F.|last2=May |first2=George S.|date= 5 September 1995 |title=Michigan: A History of the Wolverine State |url=https://books.google.co.nz/books?id=HqGWEAnByeMC |location=Grand Rapids, MI |publisher= Wm.

The college held daily sessions in the [[Michigan State Capitol]] until acquiring a location of their own in 1857. Ten years later over 1000 students had been educated. In 1869, Rogers died. Later that same year, in part as a result of her work [[Michigan State University]] (in 1869) admitted women, and the next year, the [[University of Michigan]] (in 1870) admitted women. The Michigan Women's College would eventually become the Michigan School for the Blind.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.lansingmi.gov/955/Michigan-Female-College|title=Michigan Female College {{!}} Lansing, MI|website=www.lansingmi.gov|language=en|access-date=2017-11-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.michiganwomenshalloffame.org/Images/Rogers,%20Abigail.pdf|title=Abigail Rogers|last=|first=|date=|website=Michigan Women's Hall of Fame|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.cadl.org/news/2017/03/15/michigan-women-in-history/ |title=Michigan Women in History |last= |first= |date=15 March 2017 |website=Capital Area District Libraries |publisher= |access-date=8 December 2017 |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6373">'''BCeSIS''' (the '''British Columbia Enterprise Student Information System''') is the implementation of a common student information system by independent schools and school districts of [[British Columbia]], [[Canada]]. eSIS is commercial software developed by The Administrative Assistants Ltd of Ontario, Canada, that provides a foundation for a centrally hosted, web accessible [[student information system]].

==Background==
The BCeSIS System is currently hosted by Fujitsu Canada under contract to the British Columbia Ministry of Education. Currently all districts have signed a [[memorandum of understanding]] to voluntarily adopt BCeSIS on their own timeline.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.sd42.ca/helpdesk_bcesis_description |title=Archived copy |access-date=2013-01-15 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131025085616/http://www.sd42.ca/helpdesk_bcesis_description |archive-date=2013-10-25 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Support for schools and districts adopting the new system is provided by their own local staff resources in conjunction with Fujitsu Service Desk  and the Ministry of Education. The Independent Schools of BC have pooled their resources as a consortium (the iGroup) and implementation/training and support of BCeSIS for Independent and First Nations School is handled by this consortium.

==Criticism==

===Social Criticism===

Some teachers dislike the system, believing it to be a tool of social control, centralizing potentially sensitive private information, and placing important decisions about student education in the hands of unelected committees with no background in education.&lt;ref&gt;http://bctf.ca/publications/NewsmagArticle.aspx?id=10454&lt;/ref&gt;

===Poor User Interface===

The system also draws criticism for its archaic user interface.  Some screens within the program allow arrow key movement, some functions use icons or multi-level text clicks, others require mouse clicks.  The general design was not field tested on its intended users, nor was it tested on multiple browsers, and resulted in a poor user experience.  For example, fields containing parent phone numbers only display the part of the number; a mouse click and arrow clicks are required to see the rest.  Students lists (a typical class consists of 24&amp;ndash;30 students) shows only thirteen names on the screen; one has to scroll down for the rest.  Marks entry encounters similar design faults: sideways scrolling within student field-sets are required to access the three types of data typically entered (percent, work habits, comment selection).  Combined with a start-up beset with server problems the introduction of BCeSIS was met with sharp anxiety and a call to examine whether the system was worth the $80 million expenditure.&lt;ref&gt;http://bctf.ca/publications/NewsmagArticle.aspx?id=17540&lt;/ref&gt;

BCeSIS requires the use of outdated Java versions, as support for newer versions of Java was never implemented.&lt;ref&gt;http://bcsupportonline.com/common-bcesis-questions/java-error/&lt;/ref&gt; There are many known serious security issues with the outdated version of Java required to run BCeSIS &lt;ref&gt;http://www.cvedetails.com/vulnerability-list/vendor_id-5/product_id-1083/version_id-104592/SUN-JDK-1.6.0.html&lt;/ref&gt;

Using the Teacher Assistant interface, the teacher has access to the student demographics and contact information as well as details regarding the students' performance, programs and special education needs. BCeSIS gathers attendance in the classroom using an electronic attendance checklist and allows both the teacher and the office to share information regarding student absences. In an upcoming release of BCeSIS the province will be implementing a new capability called Parent Assistant that will allow parents to monitor their children's attendance and performance as it is entered into the system.

==Media Attention==
BCeSIS drew media attention in September 2010 &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://communities.canada.com/vancouversun/blogs/reportcard/archive/2010/09/13/continued-frustration-with-school-software-known-as-bcesis.aspx |title=Archived copy |access-date=2010-09-25 |archive-url=https://archive.is/20120707113730/http://communities.canada.com/vancouversun/blogs/reportcard/archive/2010/09/13/continued-frustration-with-school-software-known-as-bcesis.aspx |archive-date=2012-07-07 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; for slow performance that hampered the efforts of schools to make timetable changes, process student transfers, and complete attendance.  With new school district using the service, Fujitsu Service Desk was forced to limit the number of logins and post "BCeSIS unavailable" messages during peak usage hours.  This compounded the performance issues and resulted in a number of internet parodies, including a re-subtitled scene from the movie [[Downfall (2004 film)|Downfall]].&lt;ref&gt;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ql-iQE08qQo&lt;/ref&gt;

On September 19, 2011, [[The Vancouver Sun]] reported that the Ministry of Education would be discontinuing use of the BCeSIS software, based on a recommendation by [[Gartner|Gartner, Inc]],&lt;ref&gt;https://vancouversun.com/pdf/bc_education_final_report.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; and would likely not have a replacement in place until 2014.&lt;ref&gt;https://vancouversun.com/technology/schools+scrap+records+software/5422355/story.html&lt;/ref&gt; The Minister of Education, [[George Abbott (politician)|George Abbott]], said that the system had glitches but was still good value for money, and was being replaced largely because the technology was outdated.

==Future==

BCeSIS is now being replaced by MyEducationBC. The first schools will be going live in September 2014. More information about implementation of MyEducationBC can be found at: https://web.archive.org/web/20140406113440/http://sisimplementation.ca/

The '''Council for Higher Education in Israel''' ({{lang-he|המועצה להשכלה גבוהה}}, ''HaMo'atza LeHaskala Gevoha'') is a supervisory body for universities and colleges in [[Israel]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://eacea.ec.europa.eu/tempus/participating_countries/overview/israel_tempus_country_fiche_final.pdf | title=Higher Education in Israel | publisher=[[European Commission]] | location=Europe | format=[[PDF]] | accessdate=28 October 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It is the only organization with the authority to award academic [[educational accreditation]]. The head of the council is always the [[Education Minister of Israel|Minister of Education]], and at least two-thirds of its members are academics.

The council is located in [[Albert Einstein Square (Jerusalem)|Albert Einstein Square]], [[Jerusalem]], next to the [[Israel Academy of Sciences and Humanities]].

==History==
The council was established in 1958, a time at which most of the academic institutions were dependent on the governmental budget, and there was concern among academics that the government would politically influence higher education institutions.{{fact|date=October 2015}}

In 1956 the government appointed a special committee, which was supposed to advise the government how to act, in order to assure that no ruling political party will be able to influence the academic institutions. The Governor of the [[Bank of Israel]], [[David Horowitz]], was the head of the committee, which advised the government to appoint a special apolitical and academic council which would supervise the functioning of the academic institutions and their relations with the government. Soon after, in 1958, the Knesset passed the Council for Higher Education Law, which established the organisation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.che.org.il/template/default_e.aspx?PageId=265 | title=The Council for Higher Education | publisher=Council for Higher Education | location=Israel | accessdate=28 October 2015 | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160303165500/http://che.org.il/template/default_e.aspx/?PageId=265 | archivedate=3 March 2016 | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In December 2005, new legislation came into force, which enlarged the student representation at the council from one to two members, one for university students and one for college students.{{fact|date=October 2015}}

==Structure and responsibilities==
The total budget of the council, which is funded by the government, is 6 billion [[shekels|NIS]] per year, which is then transferred to the public universities and colleges.{{fact|date=October 2015}} Among its duties, the council is responsible for the establishment of new universities and the expansion of existing universities.

The most important body of the council is the committee for budget and planning, which deals with the division of funding between the various universities and colleges.{{fact|date=October 2015}}

'''David Wechsler''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|w|ɛ|k|s|l|ər}}; January 12, 1896 – May 2, 1981) was a Romanian-American psychologist. He developed well-known intelligence scales, such as the [[Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale]] (WAIS) and the [[Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children]] (WISC). A ''[[Review of General Psychology]]'' survey, published in 2002, ranked Wechsler as the 51st most cited psychologist of the 20th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Haggbloom |first=Steven J. |title=The 100 most eminent psychologists of the 20th century |journal=Review of General Psychology |volume=6 |issue=2 |year=2002 |pages=139–152 |doi=10.1037/1089-2680.6.2.139 |last2=Warnick |first2=Renee |last3=Warnick |first3=Jason E. |last4=Jones |first4=Vinessa K. |last5=Yarbrough |first5=Gary ., III| displayauthors=2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Biography==
Wechsler was born in a [[History of the Jews in Romania|Jewish]] family in [[Lespezi]], [[Romania]], and emigrated with his parents to the [[United States]] as a child. He studied at the [[City College of New York]] and [[Columbia University]], where he earned his master's degree in 1917 and his Ph.D. in 1925 under the direction of [[Robert S. Woodworth]]. During [[World War I]], he worked with the [[United States Army]] to develop psychological tests to screen new draftees while studying under [[Charles Spearman]] and [[Karl Pearson]].

After short stints at various locations (including five years in private practice), Wechsler became chief [[psychologist]] at [[Bellevue Hospital Center|Bellevue Psychiatric Hospital]] in 1932, where he stayed until 1967.

He died on May 2, 1981.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author=[[Wolfgang Saxon]] |coauthors= |title=Dr. David Wechsler, 85, Author Of Intelligence Tests |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1981/05/03/obituaries/dr-david-wechsler-85-author-of-intelligence-tests.html |quote=Dr. David Wechsler, a psychologist who was the author of widely used intelligence tests, died yesterday at his home on Manhattan's East Side. He was 85 years old. |newspaper=[[The New York Times]] |date=May 3, 1981 |accessdate=2014-08-18 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Intelligence scales==

Wechsler is best known for his intelligence tests. He was one of the most influential advocates of the role of nonintellective factors in testing. He emphasized that factors other than intellectual ability are involved in intelligent behavior.&lt;ref&gt;Kaplan, R. M. &amp; Saccuzzo, O. P. (2009). Psychological testing: Principles, applications, and issues (7 ed.), (pp. 250). Belmont, CA: Wadsworth.&lt;/ref&gt; Wechsler objected to the single score offered by the 1937 Binet scale. Although his test did not directly measure nonintellective factors, it took these factors into careful account in its underlying theory.&lt;ref&gt;Kaplan, R. M. &amp; Saccuzzo, O. P. (2009). Psychological testing: Principles, applications, and issues (7 ed., pp 250-251). Belmont, CA: Wadsworth.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale]] (WAIS) was developed first in 1939 and then called the Wechsler-Bellevue Intelligence Test. From these he derived the [[Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children]] (WISC) in 1949 and the [[Wechsler Preschool and Primary Scale of Intelligence]] (WPPSI) in 1967. Wechsler originally created these tests to find out more about his patients at the Bellevue clinic and he found the then-current [[Stanford-Binet IQ test|Binet IQ test]] unsatisfactory. The tests are still based on his philosophy that intelligence is "the global capacity to act purposefully, to think rationally, and to deal effectively with [one's] environment" (cited in Kaplan &amp; Saccuzzo, p.&amp;nbsp;256).

The Wechsler scales introduced many novel concepts and breakthroughs to the intelligence testing movement. First, he did away with the quotient scores of older intelligence tests (the Q in "[[Intelligence quotient|I.Q.]]"). Instead, he assigned an arbitrary value of 100 to the mean intelligence and added or subtracted another 15 points for each [[standard deviation]] above or below the mean the subject was. While not rejecting the concept of [[g factor (psychometrics)|general intelligence]] (as conceptualized by his teacher [[Charles Spearman]]), he divided the concept of [[intelligence (trait)|intelligence]] into two main areas: verbal and performance (non-verbal) scales, each evaluated with different subtests.

==Overview==

The term '''''educology''''' denotes the fund of knowledge about education.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Fisher|first=James E|title=Contributing Paper 1.1 in History and Philosophy of Educology, Part I (A paper used as the basis for a series of seven lectures to faculty and doctoral students in educology at Vytautas Magnus University (VMU) in December, 2001)|journal=Pedagogika|publisher=Kaunus, Lithuania: Vytauto Didziojo universiteto leidykla|year=2001|url=http://www.era-usa.net/contributingpapersset1.html|issn= 1392-0340}}&lt;/ref&gt; The fund consists of the entire set of recorded true statements about education. Educology includes
# '''facts''' (verified accurate descriptions) about the field of phenomena denoted by the term ''education'',
# '''theories''' (highly plausible and well supported explanations) about how, why and when things happen as they do in education,
# '''evaluations and recommendations''' (judgments about the worth of states of affairs in education and recommendations for action to take or avoid in relation to education) and
# '''justifications''' (sound reasons based on norms and criteria) for evaluations and prescriptions made for states of affairs in education.
Some basic warranted assertions about education which have been produced by educological research and inquiry include:
# '''Education is a social system'''. It consists of the elements of teacher, student, content and setting (physical, social and cultural). In education, someone, playing the role of teacher, provides guidance and opportunities to study, and someone else, playing the role of student, intentionally studies under guidance some content (some fund of knowledge and/or some exemplification of knowing) within some physical, social and cultural setting with a view in mind that the student extends his or her range of knowing and understanding. 
# '''Education can be official or unofficial'''. Official education occurs in schools, colleges, universities and the like. Unofficial education occurs in families, in peer groups, with work colleagues, etc.
# '''Education can be effective or ineffective'''. Students can undertake to learn something and not achieve the intended learning outcomes, in which case the education has been ineffective. Or students can undertake to learn something and achieve the intended learning outcomes, in which case, the education has been effective. 
# '''Education can be good or bad'''. Bad education may have either unworthwhile, inethical, immoral, etc. intended learning outcomes or it may use undesirable, inethical, immoral, etc. means to achieve intended learning outcomes, or both conditions may exist. Good education has both worthwhile intended learning outcomes, and it employs desirable (ethical, worthy, moral, etc.) means of achieving the intended learning outcomes.
# '''Education either constructs, maintains or reconstructs social and cultural norms'''. Both official and unofficial education function, under various circumstances (political, economic, religious, historical, etc.), either to construct, maintain or reconstruct (improve, reform) the prevalent norms of the social and cultural setting in which the educational process is operating.
# '''Learning from education is intentional and guided'''. Whether official or unofficial, learning from education is intentional guided learning. It is achieved through intentional guidance and intentional study. Intentional guided learning contrasts with coerced learning, accidental learning and discovery learning. Coerced learning is achieved through the processes of socialization, enculturation, indoctrination and psychological conditioning. Accidental learning is achieved through misadventures, mishaps, catastrophes and chance experiences. Discovery learning is achieved through systematic inquiry, careful disciplined research and trial &amp; error.

Educology consists of knowledge about all aspects of education, official and unofficial, effective and ineffective, good and bad. It includes knowledge (recorded true statements) about
# '''patterns and meanings of discourse''' among teachers, students and third parties in the educational process,
# '''past states of affairs''' in education, including what happened, why it happened, what followed,
# '''extant states of affairs''' in education, including what happens, why it happens, what will happen given some set of conditions,
# '''effective practices and relations''' instrumental for achieving desired states of affairs in education and avoiding and/or eliminating undesired states of affairs in education,
# '''good and bad states of affairs''' for and in education and
# '''laws, rules and regulations''' which govern education.
For the purposes of research and guided study, educology is commonly organized into subsets or subfunds of educology. The organization is done in relation to features or aspects in the field of phenomena of education that are being researched and/or studied under guidance. Common subfunds of educology include
# '''the educology of mind (or psyche)''', which includes the part of psychology of education that treats education as the dependent variable,
# '''the educology of society''', which includes the part of sociology of education that treats education as the dependent variable,
# '''the educology of economic systems''', which includes the part of economics of education that treats education as the dependent variable,
# '''the educology of culture''', which includes the part of anthropology of education that treats education as the dependent variable,
# '''the educology of nations''', which is the same subfund of educology denoted by the term ''comparative and international education'',
# '''the educology of past states of affairs in education''', which is the same subfund of educology denoted by the term ''history of education'',
# '''the educology of good states of affairs in education''', which is the same subfund of educology denoted by the term ''philosophy of education'',
# '''the educology of effective teaching and effective guided studying''', which is the subfund of educology that includes more than, but is partly denoted by the term ''studies of teaching strategies and methodologies'' and partly denoted by the term ''productive pedagogies'',
# '''the educology of administration''', which is the same subfund of educology denoted by the term ''educational administration studies'',
# '''the educology of counseling and guidance''', which is the same subfund of educology denoted by the term ''studies of school counseling and guidance'',
# '''the educology of curriculum''', which is the same subfund of educology denoted by the term ''curriculum studies'',
# '''the educology of early childhood education''', which is the same subfund of educology denoted by the term ''early childhood education studies'',
# '''the educology of elementary education''', which is the same subfund of educology denoted by the term ''elementary education studies'',
# '''the educology of secondary education''', which is the same subfund of educology denoted by the term ''secondary education studies'',
# '''the educology of higher education''', which is the same subfund of educology denoted by the term ''higher education studies'',
# '''the educology of adult education''', which is the same subfund of educology denoted by the term ''adult education studies'',
# '''the educology of assessment and evaluation''', which is the subfund of educology that includes more than, but is partly denoted by the term ''studies of tests and measurements'',
# '''the educology of mathematics education''' which is the same subfund of educology denoted by the term ''mathematics education studies'',
# '''the educology of music education''' which is the same subfund of educology denoted by the term ''music education studies'',
# '''the educology of science education''' which is the same subfund of educology denoted by the term ''science education studies'',
# '''the educology of [any aspect of education]''', i.e. recorded true statements about any feature or characteristic of the set of phenomena denoted by the term ''education'', including any aspect of teachers, students, content and setting and any relation (e.g. dependent, independent, coincidental, causal, constructive, destructive, reconstructive, sustaining, etc.) among those four elements of education.
Development of educology commenced in the 1950s. Since that time, educology has been extended through publication of research findings in journals and books and through the establishment of departments of educology and the provision of educology courses in universities.&lt;ref name=brezinkaetal&gt;See:

==History and etymology==

===Use from the 1950s through the 1970s===
The term '''''educology''''' has been in use in the English language since the seminal work in educology by Professor Lowry W. Harding&lt;ref&gt;Lowry Harding published four works in educology. They have a light hearted tone, but there is a serious underlying message about the necessity to clarify the distinction between the educational process and knowledge about that process:

===Argument for the term ''educology''===
The term ''educology'' derives from the term ''[[education]]'' and the suffix ''-logy''. The term was coined to dispel the confusion caused by using the term ''[[education]]'' to name the process of [[teaching]], [[studying]] and learning under guidance, and calling [[knowledge]] about the educational process by the same name, ''[[education]]''.&lt;ref&gt;The first publications in English to make explicit the distinction between education, the process, and educology, the knowledge about the process, were:

Within common usage of the English language and also within special usages (i.e. technical usages) of that language, several terms have been used to name the fund of recorded knowledge about education. Included among those terms are ''[[pedagogy]]'', ''[[andragogy]]'',&lt;ref&gt;For the argument that ''andragogy'' is an appropriate name for ''knowledge about education'', see [[Malcolm Knowles]] and [[K. Patricia Cross]]:

# It names nothing less than the fund of knowledge about education.
# It names nothing more than the fund of knowledge about education.
# It prevents conceptual conflation of
::(a) the educational process with
::(b) recorded propositional knowledge about that process.
Educologists argue that the concept of educology implies the inclusion of the entire fund of recorded propositional knowledge about the entire process of education, from nascence to senescence. It is not limited only to knowledge about the education of children ([[pedagogy]])&lt;ref&gt;The argument for the term ''educology'' over the term ''[[pedagogy]]'' is cogently stated in {{cite book |last1=Steiner |first1=Elizabeth |title=Educology for the Free|year=1981|publisher=Philosophical Library |location=New York |isbn=0802223737}}, and it is iterated in{{cite book |last1=Christensen |first1=James E|title=Curriculum, Education, and Educology |year=1981 |publisher=Educology Research Associates |location=Sydney |isbn=0-949784-01-X}}&lt;/ref&gt; or to that of male adults ([[andragogy]]). It is not recorded knowledge about processes other than education, such as knowledge about character development ([[ethology]])&lt;ref&gt;See {{cite book |last1=Steiner |first1=Elizabeth |title=Educology for the Free|year=1981|publisher=Philosophical Library |location=New York |isbn=0802223737}}, pp. 50-51, for the full argument for the use of the term ''educology'' over ''[[ethology]]''.&lt;/ref&gt; or a combination of psychological knowledge and knowledge about the practice of teaching ([[psychopedagogy]]). The name ''educology'' eliminates the ambiguity which is created by naming the process of guided study with the term ''education'' and naming the fund of recorded [[propositional knowledge]] about that process with the same term ''education''.

Educologists demonstrate the power of the term ''educology'' to dispel ambiguity through techniques such as word substitution in sentences. For example, the practice of capitalizing the term ''education'' and of adding the term ''professional'' or the term ''studies'' or the term ''teacher'' to the term ''education'' are attempts to remove ambiguity. Educologists argue that the use of these terms (''Education'', ''Education Studies'', ''Professional Education'' and ''Teacher Education'') are not nearly as cogent in dispelling the ambiguity as is the use of the term ''educology''. This can be illustrated with, for example, the sentence,
{{quotation|In their ['''education'''] to qualify as primary school teachers, students study some psychology, sociology and ['''education'''].}}
The ambiguity created in the meaning of the sentence can be reduced somewhat, but not entirely, by substituting the second ''education'' with the terms ''Education'', ''Education Studies'', ''Professional Education'' and ''Teacher Education''.
# In their ['''education'''] to qualify as primary school teachers, students study some psychology, sociology and ['''Education'''].
# In their ['''education'''] to qualify as primary school teachers, students study some psychology, sociology and ['''Education Studies'''].
# In their ['''education'''] to qualify as primary school teachers, students study some psychology, sociology and ['''Professional Education'''].
# In their ['''education'''] to qualify as primary school teachers, students study some psychology, sociology and ['''Teacher Education''']. 
The ambiguity created in the meaning of the sentence can be eliminated entirely by substituting the second ''education'' with the term ''educology''.
{{quotation|In their ['''education'''] to qualify as primary school teachers, students study some psychology, sociology and ['''educology'''].}}
The term substitution of '''''educology''''' for '''''education''''' completely eliminates the ambiguity and conforms with the convention for naming funds of knowledge with the suffix ''-logy'': for example, ''psychology'' from ''psyche'' (mind) plus ''-logy'' (knowledge about); ''sociology'' from ''society'' plus ''–logy'' (knowledge about); ''educology'' from ''education'' plus ''–logy'' (knowledge about).

Educologists maintain that there are at least three compelling reasons for creating new terms in discourse about the educational process.
# A new term is indicated when a new meaning arises for which there is no satisfactory existing term.
# It is indicated when a meaning is misnamed by current usage.
# A new term is called for when current usage is ambiguous.

Educologists conclude that the case for the term ''educology'' is supported by all three reasons. The term ''education'' functions ambiguously to name the process and also to name warranted assertions about the process. To educologists, it is a misnomer to name warranted assertions about the educational process with the term ''education''. It is like using the term ''animals'' to name zoology. It is a category mistake. The term ''educology'' names a new meaning for which there is no satisfactory existing term. It names, and only names, and names nothing more than, nor less than, knowledge about education.&lt;ref name=brezinkaetal/&gt;

==Educational discourse and educological discourse==
Educologists recognize that there is discourse ''in'' education and discourse ''about'' education.&lt;ref name=chrisanalytic&gt;{{cite book|last1=Christensen |first1=James E|last2=Fisher |first2=James E|title=Analytic Philosophy of Education as a Subdiscipline of Educology|year=1979 |publisher=University Press of America|location=Washington, DC|isbn=0-8191-0802-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; Discourse ''in'' education occurs in the form of talk and writing within the educational process. Discourse ''in'' education is one of many phenomena within the educational process. Discourse ''about'' education, when it is sound, well founded and warranted, is educology. These two categories of discourse are illustrated in Table 1.

| '''The scenario is that Mark is a single parent who lives in Los Angeles. He works as an insurance adjuster. He has one child, a daughter, Bronwyn, who is just over two years old. Here is a conversation between them.'''
| '''This is an educological analysis of the conversation between Mark and Bronwyn.'''
|-
|
* Bronwyn: ''Cat! Cat!''
* Mark: ''Did you see the cat? Daddy doesn't see the cat. Where is it?''
* Bronwyn: ''Cat gone. All gone.''
* Mark: ''Daddy doesn't see the cat. Did the cat go away?''
* Bronwyn: ''See cat!''
* Mark: ''Where did the cat go? Drink your juice now.''
* Bronwyn: ''Juice!''
* Mark: ''That's right, drink your juice.''
* Bronwyn: ''Drink? Cat! Cat!''
* Mark: ''Finish your juice.''
* Bronwyn: ''Finish. Juice all gone.''
* Mark: ''Good. You've finished your juice. Your juice is all gone.''
| From an ''educological'' viewpoint, the conversation between Bronwyn and Mark is typical of the educational process. The episode has all of the distinguishing characteristics of an educational event or episode.
# Bronwyn is playing the role of student.
# Mark is playing the role of teacher.
# The content which Bronwyn is [[studying]] under guidance and Mark is teaching is the [[syntax]] (order), [[semantics]] (meaning) and [[grammar]] (inflections) of the English language.
# The setting is the physical milieu of the home, the social milieu of the single parent family, and the cultural milieu of urban America.
# The teaching methods which Mark uses include modeling, asking questions and giving directives. Bronwyn's sentences are much shorter than Mark's – one, two or three words. Mark extends the sentences and puts in all of the words required for correct grammatical, syntactical and semantic use of the language. This provides a model for Bronwyn to imitate, reduce, reconstruct and transform into new sentences.
# Bronwyn's study methods include imitation, practice, reduction, reconstruction and transformation.
# Mark's teaching style is fatherly, caring and supportive.
# Bronwyn's study style is natural, unselfconscious and spontaneous.
'''The activities of teaching'''. Mark does his [[teaching]] as a matter of course, without being selfconscious of his teaching. Educologically, this is significant because it illustrates that it is possible to act intentionally without being fully selfconscious the whole time of the intentionality. This occurs especially when the intentional action has become integrated into a person's patterns of conduct and thought in the form of habits.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Green |first1=Thomas E |title=The Activities of Teaching |year=1971 |publisher=McGraw-Hill Inc |location=New York |isbn=0-9658339-5-X}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''The activities of studying'''. The same is true of Bronwyn's [[studying]] under guidance. Intentional, unselfconscious performances are what Bronwyn and Mark are undertaking with each other in the studying and teaching of language.

'''Methods and intentions in teaching'''. It is part of Mark's set of habits to expand what Bronwyn says into full, [[syntactically]], [[grammatically]] and [[semantically]] correct sentences. His intention is to help Bronwyn to develop her ability to make such sentences, even though he may not be selfconscious of his intentionality because it has become habit.

'''Methods and intentions in studying'''. In turn, Bronwyn accepts his guidance and uses it, sometimes unselfconsciously and sometimes consciously, to signify [[meaning (linguistics)|meaning]] with her words. All of the elements for an educational transaction are present: teacher, student, content and setting, including physical, social and cultural.

'''Unofficial vs. official education'''. Mark and Bronwyn are engaged in unofficial (vs. official) education. There is no written lesson plan, instructional program, syllabus, curriculum, assessment or certification of achievement. There are no licensed teachers, principals or superintendents. The conversation is an unofficial educational episode involving a parent and child.

'''Table 1: Example of educational discourse and educological discourse'''

==Study, education, and educology==
The term ''study'' denotes the set of activities one undertakes to learn something.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Fisher|first=James E|title=The Domain of Educology|journal=International Journal of Educology|volume=10|issue=1|pages=66–143|publisher=Educology Research Associates|year=1996|url=http://catalogue.nla.gov.au/Record/1438074?lookfor=international%20journal%20of%20educology&amp;offset=2&amp;max=726406|issn=0818-0563}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Study can be done independently, outside of the educational process, without the guidance of a teacher. And it can be undertaken under the guidance of a teacher, within the educational process. Education is a process about which one can conduct inquiry and research. Educology is the fund of knowledge which is produced from well disciplined and successful inquiry and research about the process.&lt;ref&gt;One of the best sources for a clear explication of this distinction is in
* {{cite book |last=Brezinka|first=Wolfgang |editor-first=James E| editor-last=Christensen |title=Perspectives on Education as Educology |publisher=Washington, DC: University Press of America|year=1981 |pages=7–26|chapter=Chapter 1: Meta-Theory of Education: European Contributions from an Empirical-Analytic Point of View |isbn=0-8191-1394-8}}

Educology is not the study of education because educology is not an activity. Study is an activity.  One can study educology, i.e. undertake activities to learn knowledge about education with a view to extending one's range of knowing about education.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Christensen|first=James E|editor-first=James E| editor-last=Christensen|title=Perspectives on Education as Educology|publisher=Washington, DC: University Press of America|year=1981 |pages=121–158| chapter=Chapter 6: Educology and Some Related Concepts|isbn=0-8191-1394-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; But the activity of studying about education is not the fund of knowledge about education.

Education is studied by experiencing it as a participant and an observer. The study of education (i.e. undertaking study about the educational process), if conducted as serious, well disciplined inquiry and research, can produce educology (recorded true statements about education).

Educology is studied by reading it. The study of educology (i.e. undertaking study of the fund of knowledge about education), conducted independently or conducted under the guidance of a teacher, can lead a student to learn educology and develop an educological understanding of education.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Christensen|first=James E|title=Education, Educology and Educological Discourse: Theory and Structure for Education and Constructive Action in Education|journal=International Journal of Educology|volume=1|issue=1|pages=1–32|publisher=Educology Research Associates|year=1987|url=http://www.eric.ed.gov/contentdelivery/servlet/ERICServlet?accno=ED360376|issn=0818-0563}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Theory and educology==

Educology is the fund of knowledge about education, so it is not accurate to characterize educology as theory, and only theory. Educology incorporates facts with theories. Educologists develop and use theory to extend and organize educology. They also use theory to guide their research. Three kinds of theory commonly developed and used in educological inquiry are descriptive, explanatory and normative theory.

'''Descriptive theory''' consists of well defined terms. Educologists formulate and use well defined terms to denote, discern, observe and describe aspects or features in the field of phenomena of education. For example, they use clear, unambiguous, phenomenologically sound definitions of the terms ''teacher'', ''student'', ''content'' and ''setting'' to denote, discern, observe and describe teachers, students, content and settings within the field of phenomena of education.

'''Explanatory theory''' consists of a system of mutually implied statements. Educologists develop and use explanatory theory to provide reasons for why things happen as they do in education and to predict what will happen under a given set of circumstances. The predictions serve as hypotheses which can be tested. The verification or falsification of hypotheses provides evaluations of the adequacy or inadequacy of the explanatory theory. Through the evaluation of explanatory theory, the theory is affirmed, or revised, or abandoned for a more suitable explanatory theory.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Steiner |first1=Elizabeth | title= Methodology of Theory Building | year=1988  |url=https://www.indiana.edu/~tedfrick/steiner/Methodology%20of%20Theory%20Building.pdf |publisher= Educology Research Associates |location=Sydney | isbn=0949784060 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Normative theory''' consists of norms (i.e., an explicitly stated set of standards and/or rules) which are appropriate to use in making and justifying evaluations (i.e. judgments about the instrinsic worth of something) and prescriptions (i.e. recommendations about what proper, moral, ethical action ought to be taken). Educologists conduct inquiry about what set of norms are appropriate and justifiable, and they use the norms to make and justify evaluations of states of affairs in education and prescriptions for actions to take in the field of phenomena of education.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Christensen | first1=James E | title= Education, Research and Educology | year=2016 | publisher= Kindle Edition | location= Amazon.com | url=https://www.amazon.com/Education-Research-Educology-James-Christensen-ebook/dp/B0798C78ZF/ref=asap_bc?ie=UTF8 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Disciplines requisite for producing educology==
Educology is a fund of knowledge, not a discipline. But educologists use a set of disciplines to produce educology. The set of disciplines requisite for producing educology includes the sets of techniques and rules which are necessary for conducting at least three categories of inquiry and research:&lt;ref name=chrisanalytic/&gt;
# analytic inquiry and research, which requires the use of the principle of necessity reasoning,
# normative inquiry and research, which requires the use of the principle of normative reasoning,&lt;ref name=taylornormative&gt;{{cite book |last1=Taylor |first1=Paul | title=Normative Discourse |year=1961 |publisher=Prentice-Hall, Inc |location=Englewood Cliffs, NJ |url=https://www.questia.com/PM.qst?a=o&amp;d=5965524}}&lt;/ref&gt; and
# empirical inquiry and research (including experimental and non-experimental research), which requires the use of the principle of observation (including [[extrospection]] and [[introspection]]).
Educologists use the term ''process of inquiry'' to mean the same as the process of asking questions, formulating answers to those questions, and presenting necessary and sufficient evidence to warrant that the answers which are formulated are necessarily true, in the case of analytic educological facts, or very highly probably true, in the case of empirical educological facts, or are valid, sound and fruitful, in the case of educological explanatory theories and educological justificatory arguments.&lt;ref name=chrisanalytic/&gt;

==The educological perspective==
The educological perspective is inclusive of the following perspectives in discourse about the educational process or about aspects of the educational process:
# the scientific perspective (accurately characterizing what happens, why it happens and what will happen - given some specified set of circumstances - in education);
# the empirical non-scientific perspective (accurately characterizing what happens in education, but without theoretically generated prediction and hypotheses);
# the praxiological perspective (accurately prescribing what to do, what to avoid doing, what relationships to establish and what relationships to avoid to achieve desired states of affairs and outcomes in the educational process);
# the historical perspective (characterizing what has happened and why it has happened in education in the past);
# the jurisprudential perspective (characterizing what is legally allowed, prohibited and required in education);
# the analytic philosophical perspective (characterizing the implicative meanings of terms and sentences used in the educational process);
# the normative philosophical perspective (characterizing what is good or bad, desirable or undesirable, ethical or unethical and sound or not sound for and in the educational process).
Educologists use one, or a selection and sometimes all of these perspectives in their inquiry. For example, in conducting inquiry about secondary education, educologists typically address the questions of:
# What set of phenomena does the term ''secondary education'' denote? (an analytic philosophical educological question);
# What is good and what is bad secondary education? (a normative philosophical educological question);
# What are current and prevailing practices and states of affairs in secondary education, why are they that way and what are the most probable outcomes of those practices and states of affairs (a scientific educological question);
# What are current and prevailing practices and states of affairs in secondary education? (an empirical non-scientific educological question);
# What are effective practices and optimal relations which achieve desired results in secondary education? (a praxiological educological question);
# What have been past practices and states of affairs in secondary education, what have been their antecedents and what have been their consequences? (a historical educological question);
# What laws, rules and regulations govern secondary education? (a jurisprudential educological question).
Well founded and warranted answers to these questions are all part of the educology of secondary education.&lt;ref&gt;These distinctions are defined, explicated and illustrated in:
* {{cite book |last1=Christensen |first1=James E|last2=Fisher|first2=James E|title=Analytic Philosophy of Education as a Subdiscipline of Educology|pages=129–147|year=1979|publisher=University Press of America|location=Washington, DC|isbn=0-8191-0802-2}}
* {{cite book |last=Brezinka|first=Wolfgang |editor-first=James E| editor-last=Christensen |title=Perspectives on Education as Educology |publisher=Washington, DC: University Press of America|year=1981 |pages=7–26|chapter=Chapter 1: Meta-Theory of Education: European Contributions from an Empirical-Analytic Point of View |isbn=0-8191-1394-8}}

==Education as the dependent variable==
In contrast to other viewpoints (in the sense of arrangements of discourse, e.g. [[sociology]], [[anthropology]], [[psychology]]), the educological perspective treats the educational process as the [[dependent variable]], and it is used to conduct research and inquiry about the effects of other factors, such as social settings, economic activity and political attitudes, upon the educational process.&lt;ref name=steinerfreedom&gt;{{cite book |last1=Steiner |first1=Elizabeth |title=Educology for the Free|year=1981|publisher=Philosophical Library |location=New York |isbn=0802223737}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Treating education ''qua'' education, the educological perspective conceives of education as a system made up of the elements of teacher, student, content and setting, all standing in relation to each other. The educological perspectives analyzes the relations among these four elements. For example, it examines what set of relations does
# the setting (physical, social, cultural) have to teachers, students and content?
# a teacher (or set of teachers) have to students, content and setting?
# a student (or set of students) have to teachers, content and setting?
# content have to teachers, students and setting?
All other educological questions derive from this basic set of four questions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Steiner |first1=Elizabeth |title=Methodology of Theory Building Free|year=1988|publisher=Educological Research Associates |location=Sydney |isbn=0949784060}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Of course, regardless of what questions are asked about a field or how a field of phenomena is described or characterized, that field remains unchanged. Spoken or written discourse about the way a plant uses sunlight, water and soil to grow does not affect the plant in its use of those things. We can use spoken or written discourse, however, to take effective action in relation to a plant to influence its growth.

And so it is with the different arrangements of discourse (or viewpoints) about the educational process. None of the arrangements ([[sociology]], [[anthropology]], [[psychology]], educology, etc.) changes the form and function of the educational process. All can be used to take some kind of action in relation to the educational process to achieve some intended outcome or desired goal, aim, objective or state of affairs.&lt;ref name=steinerfreedom/&gt;

==The domain of educology==
The domain or territory of educology is the set of all phenomena within the educational process. Inquiry and research from an educological perspective is undertaken about this set of phenomena with the intention of producing warranted assertions, or knowledge, about education. Part of the domain or territory of educology is represented in the following table.&lt;ref&gt;See

'''Table 2: Categories of phenomena within the educational process for educological inquiry'''

==Logic, techniques and products of educological inquiry==
The relationship between educological inquiry and educology is the relationship between a process and its product. Educological inquiry uses a logic of inquiry and a set of techniques of inquiry to produce a set of products of inquiry.&lt;ref name=brezinkaetal/&gt;

'''Logic of inquiry'''. The set of disciplines which is used in the verification of statements (i.e. the warranting of assertions) is the logic of an inquiry. At least three principles of verification are used in educological inquiry.
# '''''Principle of necessity reasoning'''''. There is the principle of necessity reasoning, in which the logic requires that a statement be judged true (i.e. warranted) when it is necessarily implied by a set of true statements. The principle of necessity reasoning is the same as the principle of [[deductive reasoning|deduction]].
# '''''Principle of normative reasoning'''''. There is the principle of normative reasoning, which is used to produce evaluations and prescriptions (and justifications of evaluations and prescriptions). Evaluations are statements of the form, "X is good." Prescriptions are statements of the form, "Person A ought to do X." Justification is a set of reasons organized into an argument which verifies, validates and vindicates evaluations and/or prescriptions. Evaluations and prescriptions are judged to be true when they are consistent with a set of norms to which all persons can rationally adhere if they were in the same set of circumstances.&lt;ref name=taylornormative/&gt;
# '''''Principle of observation'''''. There is the principle of [[observation]], in which the logic requires that a statement be judged true (i.e. an assertion be affirmed as warranted) if it is consistent with necessary and sufficient observable evidence (i.e. evidence which can be accessed by [[extrospection]] and/or [[introspection]]).

'''Techniques of inquiry'''. The actual behaviors performed and the procedures followed in adducing evidence to verify a statement (warrant an assertion) are the techniques of an inquiry. Examples include conducting surveys, experimentation, drawing analogies, running simulations, locating documents, taking notes, classifying objects, defining terms, clarifying concepts, etc.

'''Products of inquiry'''. The product of successful inquiry about the educational process is educology. Educology is the set of warranted assertions (i.e. statements which are judged to be true) about some aspect of the process of teaching, studying and guided intentional learning. The set can be classified into at least three categories, viz. analytic, normative and empirical knowledge.

'''Discipline for forming educology'''. The logic and techniques for conducting inquiry about the educational process constitute the discipline requisite for conducting sound and productive educological research and inquiry, including retro-search, re-search and neo-search.&lt;ref name=steinerlater&gt;{{cite book |last=Steiner|first=Elizabeth |editor-first=James E| editor-last=Christensen |title=Perspectives on Education as Educology |publisher=Washington, DC: University Press of America|year=1981 |pages=101–120|chapter=Chapter 5: Educology: Thirteen Years Later|isbn=0-8191-1394-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; The product of sound, well disciplined and fruitful educological inquiry is educology.&lt;ref name=brezinkaetal/&gt;

'''Table 3: The discipline requisite for producing educology'''

==Critical categories for arrangement of educology into subfunds==
The product of successful educological inquiry is educology, and educology can be arranged into subsets or subfunds of educology. Two categories which are critical for the arrangement of the product of educological inquiry and research are (1) the phenomena about which inquiry is conducted and (2) the purpose of the inquiry. The use of these categories makes possible the arrangement of subfunds of educology.&lt;ref name=brezinkaetal/&gt;

'''Phenomena of inquiry'''. The something which is investigated in the act of research (including retro-search, re-search and neo-search)&lt;ref name=steinerlater/&gt; is the set of phenomena being inquired about, or the phenomena of inquiry, or the object of knowledge. Phenomena in the educational process can be classified into many categories. Six of the critical categories are:
# implications of educational discourse (discourse within education),
# worthwhile policies, practices, goals and states of affairs for and within education,
# education in past times and ages,
# existing educational phenomena,
# effective educational practices,
# legal language which guides and regulates education.

'''Purpose of inquiry'''. The intended outcome of an inquiry is its purpose. At least seven purposes of inquiry can be distinguished: (1) characterization, (2) description, (3) explanation, (4) prediction, (5) prescription, (6) evaluation and (7) justification.. '''''Characterization''''' is a set of statements which identifies the essential properties which distinguish one category of phenomena from another. '''''Description''''' is a set of statements which elucidates and represents a state of affairs as it exists. '''''Explanation''''' is a set of statements which provides reasons for why a state of affairs is as it is. '''''Prediction''''' is a set of statements which foretells how a state of affairs will be. '''''Prescription''''' is a set of statements which tells what, how and when to do something in order to achieve a desired state of affairs. '''''Evaluation''''' is a set of statements which reports that a state of affairs is good (or bad) or relatively better (or worse). '''''Justification''''' is a set of statements which presents a coherent argument about why a course of action ought to be taken (or not be taken) and/or why a state of affairs is good (or bad), better (or worse), ethical (or inethical), valuable (or worthless).

'''Subfunds of educology'''. An arrangement of educological assertions in relation to a nominated set of purposes and a specified set of features within the educational process constitutes a subfund of educology. At least seven major subfunds of educology can be distinguished with respect to phenomena of inquiry and purpose of inquiry.  They include
# analytic philosophical educology
# normative philosophical educology
# historical educology
# scientific educology
# empirical non-scientific educology
# praxiological educology
# jurisprudential educology
Other arrangements, of course, are possible. Examples include the
# educology of culture
# educology of curriculum
# educology of early childhood
# educology of economic systems
# educology of gender equity
# educology of learning
# educology of mind
# educology of moral judgment
# educology of motivation
# educology of play
# educology of school administration
# educology of society
# educology of social class
# educology of social justice
# educology of women
Culture, curriculum, early childhood, etc. are phenomena of inquiry. Thus, the subfunds of educology in the second list are arranged in relation to some subset of phenomena found in the field of phenomena of education. The subfunds of educology arranged by phenomena of inquiry typically include (1) analytic philosophical, (2) normative philosophical, (3) historical, (4) scientific, (5) empirical non-scientific, (6) praxiological, and (7) jurisprudential educology within them. For example, the educology of women implies all seven subfunds. Thus, within the educology of women, there is the
# analytic philosophical educology of women
# normative philosophical educology of women
# historical educology of women
# scientific educology of women
# empirical non-scientific educology of women
# praxiological educology of women
# jurisprudential educology of women

'''Table 4: Critical categories for arranging educology into subfunds of educology'''

==Four meanings of the term ''philosophy of education''==
At least four meanings of the term ''philosophy of education'' can be distinguished:
# [[analytic philosophy]] of education, or the fund of knowledge about meanings of concepts and propositions in educational discourse, or discourse within the educational process (this subfund of educology is analytic philosophical educology);
# [[normative]] philosophy of education, or the fund of knowledge about worthwhile states of affairs in the educational process (this subfund of educology is normative philosophical educology);
# analytic philosophy of educology, or the fund of knowledge about the meanings of concepts and propositions in educological language, or language about education;
# normative philosophy of educology, or the fund of knowledge about worthwhile states of affairs in educology (in discourse about education).
The first two are subfunds of educology. The third and fourth are knowledge about educology, not about education. Therefore, they are meta-educology, or knowledge about knowledge about education.&lt;ref&gt;Elizabeth Steiner coined the term ''meta-educology'' and explicated its meaning in {{cite book|last=Steiner|first=Elizabeth|editor-first=John Martin| editor-last=Rich|title=Readings in the Philosophy of Education, Second Edition| publisher=Belmont, California: Wadsworth Publishing Company|year=1972|chapter=The Non-Identity of Philosophy and Theory of Education|isbn=978-0-534-00204-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Analytic philosophy of education''' (or analytic philosophical educology) is an arrangement of warranted assertions which describes and characterizes the necessary implications of concepts and propositions used in discourse within the process of education. The theorizing of James Gribble, George F. Kneller, John B. Magee, [[Gilbert Ryle]], Israel Scheffler and B. Othanel Smith, for example, exemplifies analytic philosophy of education, or analytic philosophical educology.&lt;ref&gt;See
* {{cite book |last1=Gribble |first1=James |title=Introduction to Philosophy of Education|year=1969|publisher=Allyn &amp; Bacon|location=Boston}}
* {{cite book |last1=Kneller |first1=George F |title=Logic and Language of Education|year=1966|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons|location=New York|isbn=0-471-49518-2}}
* {{cite book |last1=Magee |first1=John B. |title=Philosophical Analysis in Education|year=1971|publisher=Harper &amp; Row, Publishers|location=New York|isbn=9780060441647}}
* {{cite book |last1=Ryle |first1=Gilbert |title=The Concept of Mind|year=1949|publisher=Barnes &amp; Noble |location=New York|isbn=0-389-00232-1}}
* {{cite book |last1=Scheffler |first1=Israel |title=The Language of Education|year=1960|publisher=Charles C Thomas |location=Springfield, Illinois|isbn=0-398-01656-9}}
* {{cite book|last1=Smith |first1=B Othanel|last2=Ennis |first2=Robert H (editors)|title=Language and Concepts in Education|year=1961 |publisher=Rand McNally &amp; Company|location=Chicago, Illinois}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Relevant to the explication of [[philosophy of education]] is the concept of ''language of education''. The term functions ambiguously. It can mean (1) ''language or discourse which occurs within the process of teaching and studying'', and it can also mean (2) ''language or discourse which is about the process of teaching and studying''. In its first sense, language of education means language ''in'' education. In its second sense, it means language ''about'' education. These two senses can be distinguished by subscripts:
# [language of education]&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; is language ''in'' education;
# [language of education]&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; is language ''about'' education.
What people say while engaged in the role of teaching or in the role of studying under guidance are examples of [language of education]&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; or language ''in'' education. Educology is [language of education]&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; or language ''about'' education. Educology is only that language or discourse about education which is warranted with evidence. Obviously not all discourse (or assertions) about education is warranted with evidence.&lt;ref name="chrisanalytic"/&gt;

'''Normative philosophical educology''' is the same as normative knowledge about education or normative philosophy of education. This arrangement of educology again requires the use of the three disciplines (analytic, normative, empirical). Questions of what is desirable and undesirable for and in the educational process (normative questions) lead on to questions of meaning (analytic questions) and questions of the actual consequences of actions or practices (empirical questions). To settle normative questions competently, one must also be able to settle questions of meaning and questions of actual consequences.

Normative philosophical educology addresses questions such as,
# ''Is an inquiry approach to the teaching of natural sciences an intrinsically better one than an expository approach''?
# ''Should understanding, acceptance and appreciation of gay, lesbian, bisexual, transsexual and transgender human beings be taught in schools''?

Normative philosophy of education (or normative philosophical educology) describes and characterizes that which has worth in education. The theorizing of Ernest Bayles, [[John Dewey]] and John Butler, for example, exemplifies normative philosophy of education, or normative philosophical educology.&lt;ref&gt;See for example
* {{cite book |last1=Bayles |first1=Ernest E |title=Pragmatism in Education|year=1966|publisher=Harper and Row|location=New York|isbn=0-06-040894-4}}
* {{cite book |last1=Dewey |first1=John |title=Democracy and Education|year=1916|publisher=The Macmillan Company|location=New York}}
* {{cite book |last1=Butler |first1=John |title=Idealism in Education|year=1966|publisher=Harper and Row|location=New York}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Normative philosophical educology is part of educology. It is a subfund of educology. Its focus is upon desirable and undesirable or relatively desirable and undesirable states of affairs, relationships, entities, practices, situations and the like within the educational process (and for the educational process).

Normative philosophical educology is closely related to [[philosophy of education]], but it is not identical with it. Often the term ''philosophy of education'' is used without distinguishing between normative and [[analytic philosophy]]. This usage conflates different arrangements of knowledge.&lt;ref name=chrisanalytic/&gt;

'''Philosophy of educology.''' Given the distinction between two senses of language of education, a third meaning of [[philosophy of education]] is possible to distinguish. Language about education can be an object of inquiry, or something about which inquiry can be conducted. It can be analyzed, and true statements about it can be produced. This set of true statements, or warranted assertions, constitutes a fund of knowledge. That fund includes the logic, epistemology, ethics and praxiology of making warranted assertions about the educational process. The fund includes that which is named by the term ''research methods'' or ''research methodologies'', because research methodologies about the educational process are included in the praxiology of ''educology'' (vs. the praxiology of ''education'').&lt;ref name=brezinkaetal/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Steiner |first1=Elizabeth |title=Logical and Conceptual Analytic Techniques for Educational Researchers|year=1978|publisher=University Press of America|location=Washington, DC|isbn=0-8191-0406-X}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In common usage discourse about education, the [[logic]] and [[epistemology]] of forming warranted assertions about the educational process is called ''philosophy of education'', because in common usage, the term ''education'' names (1) ''the teaching and studying process'' and (2) ''knowledge about that process''. But a name which more adequately characterizes the fund is the term ''philosophy of educology''. The substitution of the term ''educology'' for the term ''education'' in the name ''philosophy of education'' (making it ''philosophy of educology'') clarifies the point that the object of knowledge (i.e. that which the knowledge describes, characterizes and explains) is language (discourse) about education. Philosophy of educology includes '''analytic philosophy of educology''' and '''normative philosophy of educology'''.&lt;ref name=chrisanalytic/&gt;

==Educology and meta-educology==
In addition to educological inquiry and subfunds of educology, there is meta-educological inquiry and meta-educology. There is language (or discourse) ''within'' the educational process (what teachers say to students and vice versa) and language (or discourse) ''about'' the educational process (what is said about teachers and students). There can be warranted assertions about the educational process, i.e. verified statements about teachers and students. There can also be warranted assertions about what is said about teachers and students, i.e. verified statements about statements about the educational process. Warranted assertions about the educational process are educology. Warranted assertions about statements about the educational process are meta-educology.&lt;ref name=brezinkaetal/&gt; The statement,
{{quotation|''Compulsory schooling is a requirement which all contemporary nations have stipulated in law''}}
is an example of educology. In contrast, the statement in brackets,
{{quotation| [''The statement, "Compulsory school is a requirement which all contemporary nations have stipulated in law," requires verification by examining the statutes of every nation'']}}
is an example of meta-educology. It is a warranted assertion about a statement about education.

'''Meta-educological inquiry'''. Meta-educological inquiry includes asking and answering questions (with the necessary and sufficient evidence) about (1) the necessary implications, (2) the value and worth and (3) the attribution and provenance of discourse about the educational process. Thus, at least three categories of meta-educological inquiry can be distinguished: (1) analytic, (2) normative and (3) empirical.&lt;ref name=chrisanalytic/&gt;

'''Analytic meta-educological inquiry''' requires the use of the principle of necessity reasoning as its logic of inquiry. It produces warranted analytic meta-statements as its product of inquiry. Its techniques of inquiry include concept isolation, propositional isolation, concept analysis, propositional analysis, definition (including classificatory, synonymy, equivalent expression definition), identification of definition functions (including reportive, stipulative, programmatic functions), explication, model case, contrary case, borderline case, invented case, related concept, unrelated concept, term substitution, subscripts, invented terms, social context technique, result in language technique, practical results technique.&lt;ref name=chrisanalytic/&gt; Its phenomenon of inquiry (phenomenon about which inquiry is conducted) is the entire set of discourse about the educational process. Its purpose of inquiry is description and explanation of the implications of all discourse about the educational process.&lt;ref name=chrisanalytic/&gt; The statement in brackets, {{quotation|[''The statement, "Individualization is instruction that is adapted to individual needs . . .," is an analytic statement verifiable by the principle of necessity reasoning'']}}
is an example of an analytic meta-educological statement.

'''Normative meta-educological inquiry''' requires the use of the principle of normative reasoning as its logic of inquiry. It produces warranted normative meta-statements (evaluations and prescriptions) as its product of inquiry. Its techniques of inquiry include value clarification, value validation, value vindication and rational value choice.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Taylor |first1=Paul W |title=Normative Discourse|year=1961|publisher=Prentice-Hall Inc|location=Englewood Cliffs, NJ|isbn=0-8371-6628-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; Its phenomena of inquiry (phenomena about which inquiry is conducted) are intrinsically and extrinsically good and bad states of affairs for and within discourse about the educational process. Its purpose of inquiry is description, explanation, prediction, prescription and justification of intrinsically and extrinsically good states of affairs for and within discourse about the educational process.&lt;ref name=chrisanalytic/&gt; The statement in brackets, {{quotation| [''The statement, "Individualization is instruction that is adapted to individual needs . . .," is a good statement for beginning inquiry about individualization of instruction in the educational process'']}}
is an example of a normative meta-educological statement.

'''Empirical meta-educological inquiry''' requires the use of the principle of observation (extrospection) as its logic of inquiry.  It produces warranted empirical meta-statements as its product of inquiry.  Its techniques of inquiry include location of recorded texts, authentication of recorded texts and citation of recorded texts. Its phenomena of inquiry (phenomena about which inquiry is conducted) is extant recorded statements (i.e. texts in articles, journals, papers, books, etc.) about the educational process.  Its purpose of inquiry is description, attribution and provenance of extant discourse about the educational process. The statement in brackets,
{{quotation|[''The statement, "Individualization is instruction that is adapted to individual needs . . .," is found on p. 272 of'' The Teacher's Handbook ''(Dwight W. Allen &amp; Eli Seifman, Eds., 1971)'']}}
is an example of an empirical meta-educological statement.

'''Not a subfund of educology'''. Meta-educology does not constitute a subfund of educology. Educology is its phenomenon of inquiry, just as education is the phenomenon of inquiry for educology. Educology is the phenomenon about which meta-educological research inquires. Education is the phenomenon about which educological research inquires. See Table 5.

==Responsibilities of educological researchers==
It is the responsibility of educological researchers to be expert in both educological inquiry and meta-educological inquiry.&lt;ref name=chrisanalytic/&gt; Both activities are required in the task of competently making warranted assertions about the educational process. It is the educological researcher's responsibility to identify significant problems about the educational process and to solve those problems. It is also the educological researcher's obligation to clarify:

# What kind of problem is being posed to solve, i.e. what logic of inquiry does the problem require?
# What product of inquiry does the problem imply?
# What techniques of inquiry does it indicate?
# Which phenomena of inquiry demand its focus?
# What purpose of inquiry does the problem serve?

To ask and answer these five questions is to undertake meta-educological research. If the educological researcher omits these questions, the researcher risks derailment at the very beginning of the inquiry. Much work can be wasted and invalid results perpetrated if an analytic question is mistaken for an empirical one, or an empirical one, for a normative one. Each kind of question implies its appropriate logic, product, techniques, phenomena and purpose of inquiry. Analytic questions must be treated as analytic questions for the results to be valid, and so it is for normative and empirical questions. This is why educological researchers, in order to do their job properly and correctly, must be able to undertake expert meta-inquiry at the second level of discourse, i.e. at the level of warranted assertions about statements about the educational process. See Table 6.

==Knowledge about education vs. knowing about education==
Educologists distinguish between knowledge about education and knowing about education.&lt;ref name=brezinkaetal/&gt; Knowledge is recorded warranted assertions. Knowing is the learned ability to perform consciously, purposefully, intelligently and adequately in relation to some state of affairs.

'''Educological knowledge.''' Educology is one among many funds of knowledge. It is the fund of recorded warranted assertions about the educational process. It is located in the discourse of books or any other medium suitable for recording statements, e.g. magnetic tape, microfilm, microfiche, computer memory, CDs, DVDs. Recorded propositional knowledge about the educational process is related to knowing about the educational process, but it is quite distinct from it as well.&lt;ref name=brezinkaetal/&gt;

'''Educological knowing.''' From an educological viewpoint, knowing is an ability which is realized (vs. potential). It is learned (vs. being inherited or being instinctual). It is an ability to perform with some intention (i.e. it is a purposeful performance). It is done in relation to some state of affairs. And the ability takes some form, or is manifested in some way (at least five forms of knowing can be distinguished). An example of knowing is that of knowing about education. Knowing about education is educological knowing. It is the learned ability to perform adequately with intention or purpose in relation to the educational process. Knowing is located within the function of people. It is their cognitive function in relation to the educational process. People can know, but not be demonstrating that knowing at any one instant. An instance of demonstrated knowing is an exemplification of knowing. For example, a woman sitting on a bus one morning may be able to ice skate. While she is not ice skating at that moment, she still knows how to ice skate. When she actually ice skates later that afternoon, she is providing an exemplification of her knowing how to ice skate. When she teaches her students that afternoon how to execute a three-point turn, her demonstration of the three-turn is an exemplification of knowing how to do a three-turn organized for purposes of teaching and guided study. As students, people can study the recorded propositions in educology and exemplifications of educological knowing (live or recorded in some medium - sound, photographs, film, DVD, etc.) in order to extend their educological knowing. In doing so, they extend their cognitive function in relation to the educational process. Through their study, they might improve their function with respect to their conduct as teachers, students, counselors, coaches, trainers, mentors, curriculum developers, educational administrators and managers, or educological researchers (including retro-researchers, re-searchers and neo-searchers).&lt;ref name=brezinkaetal/&gt;

'''Extension of knowing from studying educology.''' As students, through their study of educology and exemplifications of educological knowing (knowing-that-one, knowing-that, knowing-how and knowing-to), people can extend their ability to speak purposefully and adequately about education or to speak purposefully and adequately while engaging within the process of education as a teacher, student, counselor, curriculum developer, administrator or manager. They might extend their ability to think to themselves, silently, about education, to write soundly about education, or to draw supportable and warranted inferences about education. Studying educology and representations of educological knowing, under guidance or independently, is a means by which one can extend one's ability to recall educational states of affairs, anticipate educational moments, create educational occasions, or discern educational transactions.&lt;ref name=brezinkaetal/&gt;

'''Transience of knowing vs. permanence of knowledge.''' It is the nature of human beings that we are mortal. We all die, and our knowing dies with us. But educology and recorded exemplifications of educological knowing do not die. While a person's cognitive function ceases with that person, recorded propositions about education remain in the recorded media, and recorded exemplifications of educological knowing also remain in the recorded media. Each person who comes anew as a student to the fund of educology and the recorded exemplifications of educological knowing has the opportunity to extend her or his educological knowing. In addition, new generations, through successful educological research (retro-search, re-search, neo-search) have the opportunity to contribute to the revision and extension of the fund of warranted assertions which constitutes educology.&lt;ref name=brezinkaetal/&gt;

==The range of educological knowing==
Educologists distinguish at least four kinds of educological knowing. Each of the kinds may be manifested in at least five forms and at three levels. The four kinds are ''knowing-that-one'', ''knowing-that'', ''knowing-how'' and ''knowing-to''.&lt;ref&gt;See

The five forms of knowing are distinguishable with respect to the manner in which the knowing is manifested. The three levels of knowing are distinguishable with respect to the degree of expertise with which the knowing is performed.

'''Range of knowing.''' The combination of kinds, forms and levels of knowing constitutes a range of knowing. A range of knowing may vary from narrowly restricted to widely extended. It is possible for a person to develop ''knowing-that-one'' without ''knowing-how'' or ''knowing-that'' without ''knowng-to''. It is possible for a person to develop, for example, ''knowing-how'' at a conventional level in a linguistic form, but not in a physical form. A wide or extensive range of knowing constitutes understanding.

'''Table 7: Range of knowing as combinations of levels, kinds and forms of knowing'''

'''Knowing-that-one.''' ''Knowing-that-one'' about education is the ability to perform adequately in relation to unique states of affairs within education. A teacher recognizes, is acquainted with and appreciates Michael's moods, motivations, aspirations and capabilities, not as an adolescent or a middle class child or a student in his 9th year of school, but as Michael, in all of his uniqueness. This is an example of a teacher's ''knowing-that-one''. The teacher might be able to manifest this ''knowing-that-one'' of Michael in talking with Michael (linguistic knowing), in anticipating Michael's behavior (imaginal knowing), in making gestures to which Michael will respond positively (physical knowing). ''Knowing-that-one'' of education gives the knower (e.g. teacher, student, counselor, administrator, manager, curriculum developer, researcher) sensitivity for the educational process and for features within the process so that significant and important aspects of the process can be discerned and appreciated by the knower.

'''Knowing-that.''' ''Knowing-that'' about education is the ability to perform adequately in relation to states of affairs within education as members of categories. A teacher can, for example, classify Michael's behavior as typical of 15-year-olds. The teacher can categorize Michael's capabilities as characteristic of middle level achievers and relate his aspirations and motivations to what one might expect of middle class adolescents. The teacher might manifest this ''knowing-that'' in writing a report (linguistic knowing), in having a feeling of familiarity and towards Michael's behavior as typical of boys of his age (an emotional knowing), in imagining how Michael will resemble his mates in a year's time (imaginal knowing), in making gestures and managing body language towards boys of Michael's kind (physical knowing). ''Knowing-that'' gives the knower adequacy and power with respect to theory (i.e. ''knowing-that'' gives theoretical adequacy). The knower with ''knowing-that'' about education can describe and explain (i.e. theorize) about the educational process in terms of categories, classifications and relationships of features or aspects of the educational process. The knower can do this, if she or he has ''knowing-that'', with necessary and sufficient evidence and sound inferences.

'''Knowing-how.''' ''Knowing-how'' is the ability to use a set of procedures to achieve an intended result. A teacher, for example, starts class by having the children line up outside the classroom, enter the classroom in single file and take their seats as assigned seats. The teacher has learned that this set of procedures achieves an orderly entry into the room and focuses the attention of pupils upon what is to happen next in the lesson. In this example, this teacher is manifesting ''knowing-how''. When the teacher is giving directions, the ''knowing-how'' is being manifested as linguistic ''knowing-how''. It can be manifested in gestures and body language (physical knowing), in feelings (emotional knowing), in anticipation (imaginal knowing). ''Knowing-how'' is the basis for effective action within the educational process.

'''Knowing-to.''' ''Knowing-to'' is the realized ability to exercise conscious intention, will and choice in a rational way that is consistent with a set of freely and rationally chosen norms (i.e. standards and/or rules). A synonym for ''knowing-to'' is conative knowing. Conative knowing is a state of ''knowing-to'', as distinct from ''knowing-that-one'', ''knowing-that'' or ''knowing-how''. Individuals have achieved a state of ''knowing-to'' when they can say (and mean and justify it), "I am willing to do that." That state of willingness, or ''knowing-to'', is the same as conative knowing.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Maccia|first=George|title=Educological Epistemology|journal=A paper presented to the 1973 Annual Meeting of the Ohio Valley Philosophy of Education Society| publisher=Cincinnati, Ohio|date=November 1973}}&lt;/ref&gt; Conative knowing is the ability to choose rational courses of action which are consistent with standards and rules by which to regulate, control and direct one's self. Conative knowing is the basis for living a rational, principled life. Conative knowing gives us the ability to set goals and make plans in relation to criteria and to make choices consistent with chosen plans and goals. Conative knowing, or ''knowing-to'', is the realized ability to consciously and thoughtfully live consistently by a set of standards and rules. An example of ''knowing-to'' is a teacher consciously choosing to treat each and every student respectfully, courteously and fairly.

'''Other possibilities of knowing.''' While the examples just given of ''knowing-that-one'', ''knowing-that'', ''knowing-how'' and ''knowing-to'' were ones in which a teacher manifested the four kinds and five forms of knowing, other players in the educational process are capable of learning these kinds and forms of knowing about education. These include students, counselors, coaches, mentors, administrators, managers, curriculum specialists and any one interested in knowing about education from a professional viewpoint or from the viewpoint of extending one's liberal education. One can develop educological knowing as a liberal study as well as a professional study.

'''Levels of knowing.''' At least three levels of knowing are possible (preconventional, conventional and postconventional). The three levels relate to the distinctions of beginner, intermediate, expert and expert innovator. One who has preconventional knowing is just at the beginning of learning some kind and form of knowing about education. The person has not yet achieved the conventions for a set of knowing. At the conventional level, the person has learned the conventions, and the level includes both intermediate and expert performances. The postconventional level is being manifested when the knower is creating innovations which have not yet become conventions. Innovative expert performers within the educational process and researchers who are engaged in neo-search about the educational process, if successful, are performing at the postconventional level of knowing. They are setting new standards or conventions of knowing about education.

==Educological understanding==
From an educological viewpoint, understanding is the realized ability to perform consciously, purposefully, intelligently and in a well informed way to resolve challenges, solve problems and achieve desired results within some state of affairs.&lt;ref&gt;See

More specifically, educological understanding is the realized ability to perform consciously, purposefully, intelligently and in a well informed way to resolve challenges, solve problems and achieve desired results for and within the educational process. Educological understanding relates to educological knowing in that educological understanding is the achievement of some range of educological knowing at the conventional and post-conventional levels. A wide or extensive range of educological knowing at the conventional and post-conventional levels constitutes educological understanding.

==The way to rational constructive action in education==
Within matters educational, experience is highly prized. While it is true that experience within the educational process is important for developing educological understanding, educologists maintain that experience alone is insufficient.&lt;ref name=brezinkaetal/&gt; All of us experience disease, but this does not qualify us as medical practitioners. We occupy space and exist in time, but this experience does not transform us into physicists. So it is with educological knowing. In order to develop educological understanding, one must engage in experiences with an educological perspective so that the significant and important features of the experience may be discerned, reflected upon, evaluated and appreciated educologically. In order to develop a range of knowing about education, one must, as a student, study educology and representations of educological knowing in addition to having experience within the educational process. Rational constructive action within the educational process requires educological understanding. Without understanding, naive uninformed action can be taken, but not rational, well informed action. If naive uninformed action is constructive, it will be by accident, not by educological knowing. The way to rational constructive action within the educational process is through coming to know as much as one can about education from an educological perspective. Educological knowing requires study of educology, i.e. the reading and comprehension, reflection upon and intelligent action in relation to warranted assertions about the educational process. It is educology which provides concepts, propositions, facts and theory about education and cognitive structure for reasoning about education and for taking rational constructive action in and for education.

==Uses of educology==
'''Liberal and professional education.''' Educologists argue that educology has uses in the curriculum of liberal education as well as professional education. Liberal education is undertaken to extend one's ability to function as a free person with free will within a free and democratic society. Professional education is undertaken to function as an effective, ethical and accountable practitioner, e.g. a teacher, counsellor or mentor, within the educational process.&lt;ref name=steinerfreedom/&gt; Sound educological understanding provides the basis for undertaking rational, constructive action within the educational process and for engaging in sound, well informed discourse about the educational process. Through studying educology, one can develop educological understanding towards several ends, e.g. towards
# heightened sensitivity for, to and within educational situations,
# effective participation within educational situations (as teacher, student, counsellor, coach, manager, etc.),
# articulation of sound theory and justificatory arguments about educational situations and
# resolution of problems connected with educational situations.
The liberal and professional uses of educology are described, explained and illustrated in a number of educological works.&lt;ref name=brezinkaetal/&gt;

'''Naming professional organizations.''' Another important use of educology is the naming of professional organizations whose purposes are to conduct research, produce knowledge and disseminate knowledge about the educational process. For example, the conflation of (1) object of inquiry with (2) product of inquiry is removed by making the change of name from:
# the ''American '''Educational''' Research Association'' to the ''American '''Educological''' Research Association'',
# the ''Australian Association for Research in '''Education''''' to the ''Australian Association for Research in '''Educology''''',
# the ''Comparative '''Education''' Society'' to ''Comparative '''Educology''' Society'' and
# the ''Society of Professors of '''Education''''' to the ''Society of Professors of '''Educology'''''.&lt;ref name=chrisorganization&gt;For detailed explanation and exemplification, see:

'''Naming organizational units.''' Likewise, educology has an important use for naming organizational units whose purpose it is to teach and extend knowledge about the educational process. The use of educology in the naming of organizational units within academies, institutes, colleges and universities dispels conflation of concepts and confusion in discourse about education. For example, the name change from:
# ''college of '''education''''' to ''college of '''educology''''',
# ''school of '''education''''' to ''school of '''educology''''',
# ''faculty of '''education''''' to ''faculty of '''educology''''' and
# ''department of '''education''''' to ''department of '''educology'''''
removes the conflation of (1) object of inquiry with (2) product of inquiry and makes clear that the purpose of the units is to teach and study knowledge about educational phenomena and extend knowledge about the educational process.&lt;ref name=chrisorganization/&gt;

'''Structuring programs, curricula and courses.''' Within organizational units of educology (university faculties, colleges, schools, departments) the six critical categories of
# kind of inquiry
# logic of inquiry
# techniques of inquiry
# phenomena inquired about
# purpose of inquiry
# products of inquiry
have important applications for making decisions about
# course titles and descriptions,
# curriculum arrangements and
# organization of academic staff.
Use of these categories reduces the likelihood of category mistakes, nonsensical contradictions and wasteful duplication in educological programs, curricula, courses and organization of staff. The application of the six categories also increases the probability of arrangements of academic staff and curricula which have coherency, clarity and flexibility, without ambiguity or equivocation. The benefits of using the six critical categories include the likelihood of producing an organization which (1) makes sense to those whom it arranges and (2) contributes to cooperative effort towards the worthwhile goal of extending knowledge about education.&lt;ref name=chrisorganization/&gt;

'''The role of units of educology.''' From an educological perspective, the proper role of a unit of educology (i.e. a faculty, school, college, department or division of educology) within a university is to provide a favorable and supportive environment in which
# educologists may conduct research about the educational process and extend educology,
# teachers of educology may successfully guide their students in extending their range of educological knowing and understanding,
# users of educology may consult with educologists about ways and means of resolving issues and meeting challenges in the educational process,
# meta-educologists may conduct research about discourse about the educational process and extend meta-educology,
# teachers of meta-educology may successfully guide their students in extending their range of meta-educological knowing and understanding and
# users of meta-educology may use their meta-educological understanding as educologists in the conduct of their educological research.&lt;ref name=chrisorganization/&gt;

The '''Evangelical Theology Student Council''' (German: „Studierendenrat Evangelische Theologie“) or SETh, is a German student advisory board which represents the interests of all Evangelical [Lutheran] theology students throughout [[Federal Republic of Germany|Germany]]. More than 40 member organisations, consisted of student representatives at state and clerical universities, as well as student convents of Evangelical churches, belong to the SETh.

== Organisation and Work ==
The highest organ of the SETh is the three times annually plenary meeting which assembles delegates of all member organisations, residing at places provided by varying student boards within the SETh. Subjects of the plenary meetings are, among others, education and church politics in Germany.

The SETh maintains relations to the [[Evangelical Church in Germany]] (German: Evangelische Kirche in Deutschland), the assembly of the Evangelical Theological Faculties in Germany (German: Evangelisch-Theologischer Fakultätentag), the [[Kultusministerkonferenz|Standing Conference of the Ministers of Education and Cultural Affairs of the Länder in the Federal Republic]] (German: Kultusminsterkonferenz), and other related organisations.

The faculty is widely recognized as one of the leading international relations institutes. The Academic Ranking and Rating Agency ranked the faculty's [[international relations|international affairs]] and [[diplomacy]] program first in nation, and among top in [[Central Europe]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://tvnoviny.sk/sekcia/spravy/domace/prinasame-rebricky-fakult-vysokych-skol.html |title=Prinášame rebríčky fakúlt vysokých škôl |publisher=tvnoviny.sk |date= |accessdate=2012-07-04 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120714060831/http://tvnoviny.sk/sekcia/spravy/domace/prinasame-rebricky-fakult-vysokych-skol.html |archivedate=2012-07-14 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since 2009 the faculty headquarters the National Center of Excellence for International Security Studies&lt;ref name="projekty1"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.projekty.umb.sk/OPVaV/2.1/26220120010/umbbd.nsf |title=Centrum Excelentnosti Úvod |language=sk |publisher=Projekty.umb.sk |date= |accessdate=2012-07-04 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111013190757/http://www.projekty.umb.sk/OPVaV/2.1/26220120010/umbbd.nsf |archivedate=2011-10-13 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; funded through the RD Program of the [[European Union|EU]].

==Campus==
[[File:Courtyard of FPVMV.jpg|thumb|right|Courtyard of The Faculty of Political Science and International Relations, UMB]]
The faculty campus is located in the historical city downtown of [[Banská Bystrica]], bordering the branch office of the [[National Bank of Slovakia]] and the Matej Bel University Rector´s department. The campus consists of two buildings, which are set in a 4-acre urban park overlooking the river [[Hron]]. The main building is an early 17th-century [[chateau]], which was completely reconstructed in 1995 and 2010. The second building is an early 17th-century servant's house, which served for many years as a headquarters for the faculty's various student organizations. Partially reconstructed by the Euro-Atlantic Center, it had been the headquarters for the Slovak Atlantic Commission and the Centre of Nations, until 2011 when the newly established Slovak-French university institute moved into this object.

==Academics==
The faculty has had a distinctive international reputation since it was founded in 1995. The faculty's graduates have, on average, one of the largest salaries in the country.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://vs.iedu.sk/sk/profil/-/-/fakulta=f714060000 |title=Informácie o vysokých školách - Profil |publisher=Vs.iedu.sk |date= |accessdate=2012-07-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The faculty publishes the ''Politické vedy'' journal which was run from 1998-2000 in cooperation with the Institute of Political Sciences at the [[Slovak Academy of Sciences]], but since 2000 it has been exclusively administrated by the Faculty of Political Science and International Relations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.upv.sav.sk/index.php?ID=118 |title=Politické vedy - 1998 - 2000 |publisher=Upv.sav.sk |date= |accessdate=2012-07-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Partnerships===
As a part of its internationally focused education, it encourages students to add an international component to their studies by living in a foreign country. The school believes that the experience is a key part of an education in international affairs because it increases understanding of the world by providing students with a variety of new and unexpected perspectives. The program functions as bilateral partnerships with a number of schools.

Some of these include [[The London School of Economics]] in UK, [[Indiana University]] in US, [[University of Bologna]] in Italy, [[University of Cologne]] in Germany, [[Katholieke Universiteit Leuven]] in Belgium, [[Ministry of Foreign Affairs (Serbia)]] - Diplomatic Academy, [[Complutense University of Madrid]] in Spain etc. The faculty constantly looks for new partners and schools are added on a yearly basis.

In 2011, the faculty established the [https://web.archive.org/web/20120518200110/http://www.iufs.sk/lang/fr Slovak-French University Institute], in partnership with the [[French Embassy]] in Slovakia and two French Universities. The institute is headquartered on the school's campus and its main goal is to support [[scientific]] [[cooperation]] and [[academic mobility]] between French and Slovakian universities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.esn.sk/article/international-day-matej-bel-university?page=1 |archive-url=https://archive.is/20120804013731/http://www.esn.sk/article/international-day-matej-bel-university?page=1 |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2012-08-04 |title=International Day at Matej Bel University &amp;#124; ESN Slovakia |publisher=Esn.sk |date= |accessdate=2012-07-04 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Debating club MB school of political sciences and international relations.jpg|thumb|Debating club - Video conference with Ioannis Vrailas, deputy head of the European Union Delegation to the United Nations]]
There are about 600 full-time students and 100 part-time students at the faculty.

Student organizations at FPVaMV-UMB provide students with opportunities to get involved in a wide variety of interest areas including academic, social, religious, artistic, service-based, diversity and many more.

===Greek life===
The Faculty of Political Science and International Relations of Matej Bel University is home to the Sigma Phi Kappa&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.facebook.com/pages/SIGMA-PHI-KAPPA/322043315439 |title=Sigma Phi Kappa |publisher=Facebook |date=2012-06-16 |accessdate=2012-07-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; fraternity. However, there is no "Greek row" on campus, nor is the fraternity formally acknowledged by the faculty. Activities of SPK are wide-ranging and include the organization of sporting events, organizing student parties, participating in fund raising events and more. The Sigma Phi Kappa also publishes a newsletter called PARTA HREJ.

SPK's symbol is a [[platypus]], representative colors are yellow and light blue.

==Administration==
The school is administrated by the Dean's department. The school's scientific and research tasks are however determined by the Scientific Board. The main governing body of the school is the Academic Senate.

The faculty's current dean is Associate Professor Branislav Kováčik. The first dean of the faculty was Peter Kulašik, formerly a senior scientist at the Political Science Institute of the Slovak Academy of Sciences.

'''National Financial Literacy Month''' is recognized in the United States in April in an effort to highlight the importance of [[financial literacy]] and teach Americans how to establish and maintain healthy financial habits.&lt;ref&gt;Senate Resolution 316; sponsored by Sen. Daniel Akaka D-HI&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2000, The National Endowment for Financial Education introduced Youth Financial Literacy Day and turned it over to the Jump$tart Coalition for Personal Financial Literacy so that the event would not promote any one organization and instead focus on financial literacy as a whole. The Jump$tart Coalition and its approximately 150 partners expanded the event to a month.
  
In 2003, the [[United States Senate]] designated April as ''Financial Literacy for Youth Month''. In March 2004 the Senate passed Resolution 316 that officially recognized April as ''National Financial Literacy Month''.

Many{{Weasel-inline|date=May 2010}} of the country’s [[financial institutions]] and [[nonprofit]] financial educational organizations promote the month{{Citation needed|date=January 2009}} by holding promotional events and creating educational materials that center around effectively handling money and dealing with debt.

==Educational initiatives==
{{see also|Financial Literacy Curriculum}}
[[Money Management International]], a nonprofit credit and debt counseling firm, created a [[microsite]] to support the mission of National Financial Literacy Month, with a step by step process for improving financial wellness.

==Government support==
In 2003 the [[United States Congress]] showed its support for the idea of a financial literacy month. Senate Resolution 48 and House Resolution 127 asked President [[George W. Bush]] to declare April Financial Literacy for Youth Month. At that time, governors of eight states had already named the month of April as such.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.jumpstartcoalition.org/fileuptemp/AprilFinancialLiteracyMonth.doc&lt;/ref&gt; April was named National Financial Literacy Month by the passing of Senate Resolution 316 with [[unanimous consent]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.jumpstartcoalition.org/fileuptemp/AprilFinancialLiteracyMonth.doc and http://www.jumpstartcoalition.org/fileuptemp/FINAL%20PR%202004%20Legislator%20Award.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

In April 2005, the [[United States House of Representatives]] passed a bill supporting the goals and ideals of Financial Literacy Month.&lt;ref name=2005house&gt;http://thomas.loc.gov/cgi-bin/bdquery/z?d109:HE00148:@@@L&amp;summ2=m&amp;&lt;/ref&gt;  This bill, and the resolution passed by the Senate, called on President Bush to issue a proclamation calling on Federal Government, States, localities, schools, nonprofit organizations business and the people of the United States to observe the month with appropriate programs and activities.&lt;ref name=2005house/&gt; During his term in office, President Bush did not issue a proclamation.{{Citation needed|date=January 2009}}

During Financial Literacy Month in 2006, The [[Financial Literacy and Education Commission]] unveiled a new national strategy in their report "Taking Ownership of the Future: The National Strategy for Financial Literacy". The report outlined a series of outreach and education goals for the public and private sectors aimed to help Americans improve their understanding of financial issues such as credit management, savings, and homeownership.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.mymoney.gov/pdfs/ownership.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

Throughout the years, multiple states have also proclaimed April as Financial Literacy Month including [http://www.cscuf.coop/repository/arkansas+proclamation.pdf Arkansas], [http://www.cscuf.coop/repository/Oklahoma+April+Proclamation+optimized.pdf Oklahoma], [http://www.legis.state.pa.us/cfdocs/billInfo/billInfo.cfm?sYear=2017&amp;sInd=0&amp;body=H&amp;type=R&amp;bn=0777 Pennsylvania], and [http://www.cscuf.coop/repository/Texas+April+Proclamation.pdf Texas].

==Financial Literacy Month in Canada==
Differing from the US, November is Canada’s Financial Literacy Month. The month is organized by the Financial Literacy Action Group (FLAG), a coalition of 7 non-profit organizations who work with the federal government body [[Financial Consumer Agency of Canada]] (FCAC).

Throughout November FLAG organizes events across Canada to educate and engage with the public regarding the need for financial literacy and promote services available to the public: 
“[FLAG] raises awareness of the need for financial literacy and highlights the programs, services and tools available to help Canadians improve their financial knowledge, skills and confidence.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.financialliteracymonth.ca/en/about-flm&lt;/ref&gt;”

The purpose of this month is to educate the public so Canadians are equipped to:

- Provide for themselves and their family

- Invest in their future and the future of their children

- Understand their financial rights and obligations

- Contribute to the community as a good citizen

Similar to the United States, many of the country’s [[financial institutions]] (such as Planswell, Wealthsimple, RBC) and [[nonprofit]] financial educational organizations promote the month by creating educational material and hosting promotional events that center around topics of personal finances.

The first documented use of the term '''firsthand learning''', by Mark St. John of Inverness Research Associates,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.inverness-research.org/reports/1999-09-Rpt-waitdonttellme-polinqlc.PDF | last=St. John | first=Mark | title=Wait!

Firsthand learning is, at its core, learning from [[direct experience]].

Arising from a learner's [[innate]] [[curiosity]] and the desire to investigate real phenomena, firsthand learning empowers people by providing them with opportunities to figure things out for themselves, to believe in the analytical abilities of their own minds, and to connect with the world around them. It requires close engagement with the immediate environment.

Firsthand learning is an [[inquiry]] process that is generative of questions that focus subsequent investigations. The process invites learners to gather and record their observations, to analyze&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

Firsthand learning involves communication of the results of this investigative process. Sharing evidence and discussing findings with others underscores that learning is a social process.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation

'''The Friends of Waldorf Education''' (''Freunde der Erziehungskunst Rudolf Steiners e. V.''), referred to as the “Friends” below, is a [[Charitable organization|charity]] association  founded in 1971 registered in [[Stuttgart]], Germany. The association fosters initiatives all over the world for a free education and organisations that work on the basis of [[Waldorf education]].

As umbrella organisation for the German government-sponsored Voluntary Services, the association places approximately 1000 volunteers per year both inside Germany and internationally.

The branch “Crisis or Emergency Education” of the Friends of Waldorf Education carries out international War and Catastrophe assistance for traumatised children and young people since 2006.

==History==
in 1969, Waldorf education celebrated the 50th anniversary of its establishment and was expanding increasingly throughout the world. In order to bring together a group of people who would support the growing school movement both ideally and financially, [[Ernst Weissert]] founded the Friends of Waldorf Education on 10 October 1971.

Ernst Weissert himself did not stand for membership of the Executive, leaving this task to his closest assistant and second member, Dr. Manfred Leist. Other members of the Executive were Günter Ziegenbein (member of the Board of the Waldorf school in the Kräherwald, Stuttgart), and Armin Scholter, the administrator of the same school. This guaranteed a secure existence for the association. Many former students of the Waldorf school, Uhlandshöhe became members and have, to a great extent, remained so until today. Both Ernst Weissert and Manfred Leist had, however, other pressing tasks in building up the German school’s movement and within the leadership of the [[:de:Bund der Freien Waldorfschulen|Bund der Freien Waldorfschulen]], so that there was little time left over for this association.

In 1976, certain former Waldorf students had the idea of founding a Worldwide School’s association. Ernst Weissert took up this intention and offered them the Association Friends of Waldorf Education as a legal entity. Andreas Büttner, Nana Göbel and Justus Wittich were elected onto the executive in November 1978, Günther Ziegenbein and Armin Scholter withdrew. The association was renamed  “Freunde der Erziehungskunst Rudolf Steiners” (Friends of the Art of Education of Rudolf Steiner). Under the guidance of the new executive, the international support and networking activity was built up, amongst others with the newly founded International Aid Fund.

In 1994 the Friends were invited by [[UNESCO]] to attend the International Education Conference in Geneva in order to present Waldorf Education before an international public. This co-work with UNESCO continued and in May 2001 the Friends of Waldorf Education established official relations with UNESCO.&lt;ref&gt;Freunde der Erziehungskunst Rudolf Steiners (Hrsg.): ''Waldorfpädagogik weltweit.'' Berlin, 2001, S. 12–17.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://ngo-db.unesco.org/r/or/en/1100053723|title= Friends of Waldorf Education|work=ngo-db.unesco.org|date= |accessdate=2014-08-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Today the association employs about 90 co-workers and has two branches, one in [[Berlin]] and another in [[Karlsruhe]]

In the executive of the association are Nana Göbel, Bernd Ruf, [[Henning Kullak-Ublick]] and Andreas Schubert.

==Areas of work==
The work of the Friends consists of different areas of activity, all of which stand in relation to and serve Waldorf education.

=== Project support/International Aid Fund ===
The Friends support Waldorf schools, Waldorf kindergartens, and anthroposophical [[Special education]] organisations throughout the world through donations but also through counselling, networking, mentoring etc. The association has no capital of its own, is thus not a foundation, but receives donations and legacies from many different individual donors, from Waldorf schools and other institutions and from foundations connected with it. These it uses in accordance with the wishes of the donors, for is important for the Friends that the donors themselves decide who or what they wish to support.

95% of all donations received by the Friends are for a specific pre-defined purpose. The donors support institutions to which they themselves have a relationship, because of a report they have read or some other personal reason.

In order to support essential larger investments, the Friends work together with foundations and other aid funds, as well as with the [[Federal Ministry of Economic Cooperation and Development|BMZ]] (Federal Ministry of Economic Cooperation and Development).

===Voluntary services===
Since 1993 the Friends have promoted and organised international voluntary services.

Volunteers work in Waldorf educational or anthroposophicallly oriented institutions, communities (of persons with and without disability), schools, nursery schools and social projects.

A year of social service abroad can be arranged with the Friends through the following (German) state funded programmes:
* [http://www.internationaler-jugend-freiwilligendienst.de/ Internationaler Jugendfreiwilligendienst ](IJFD)
* Entwicklungspolitischer Freiwilligendienst 
* [[:de:Anderer Dienst im Ausland|Anderer Dienst im Ausland]] (ADiA)

The Friends are certified for this international social service work with the Quifd Quality Seal Quifd-Gütesiegel (Qualität im Freiwilligendienst).

From 2011, the association offers voluntary services within Germany itself.
* [[:de:Bundesfreiwilligendienst|Bundesfreiwilligendienst]] (BFD)
* [[:de:Freiwilliges Soziales Jahr|Freiwilliges Soziales Jahr]] (FSJ)

In 2006 the Friends were authorised to offer a year of social service to international volunteers in Germany. This “incoming” programme has been incorporated into the State Voluntary Services since 2011.

===Educational Godparenting===
At the end of the 1990s the organisation of educational godparents was taken up as a new area of engagement in order to enable individual children in countries where Waldorf schools receive no state funding, having therefore to rely entirely on fee income, to nevertheless attend a Waldorf school.

Godparents constitute a quite individual form of assistance. Waldorf schools have from the beginning been dedicated and open to all human beings and classes of society. It should not depend on the economic situation of the parents whether a child is able to attend a Waldorf school or not. In this manner the godparents support the individual child and also the whole school community.

Thus far the association has organised around 700 godparents.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.freunde-waldorf.de/fileadmin/user_upload/documents/Die_Freunde/Publikationen/Rundbrief/RB_2013_H.pdf|title= Bildungspatenschaften – Rundbrief der Freunde der Erziehungskunst – Herbst 2013|publisher=Friends of Waldorf Education|date= |accessdate=2014-08-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; These support the equivalent number of children at over 50 schools with amounts ranging between 25 and 200 Euros per month.

===WOW-Day===
From 1994 on, students have engaged themselves on one day of the year for Waldorf initiatives the world over. By means of artistic endeavours or day jobs they collect money for Waldorf institutions and projects that are in need of financial assistance.

With the help of the Friends and their partner organisations, the Bund der Freien Waldorfschulen and the European Council for Steiner Waldorf Education, the student campaign has grown from year to year. Students learn to become engaged on behalf of others and to take an interest in other cultural environments as well as experiencing how to organise community events and transform their ideas into reality.

Over 200 Waldorf schools participate each year in more than 30 countries on a commonly agreed day in Autumn.

Around 2.5 million Euros have been collected by students on the WOW-Days since 1994 (2013) and have supported over 100 organisations worldwide.

Collected donations are first paid into the account of the Friends of Waldorf Education, who undertake to transfer 100% of the amount on to the projects.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.freunde-waldorf.de/fileadmin/user_upload/documents/Die_Freunde/Publikationen/Rundbrief/RB_2013_H.pdf|title= WOW-Day – Rundbrief der Freunde der Erziehungskunst Rudolf Steiners, Herbst 2013|publisher=Friends of Waldorf Education|date=|accessdate=2014-08-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Crisis or emergency education===
Emergency or crisis education concerns itself with the psychological stabilising of children and young people in warfare and the aftermaths of natural catastrophes. To date over 25 engagements have taken place in nine different countries.

Curative teacher Bernd Ruf developed a comprehensive concept based on the insights of Waldorf education for this Emergency education after he had experienced the results of trauma on children in a refugee camp in Beirut during the war in Lebanon in 2006.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.treuhandstelle-hh.de/files/Hinweis_2012_11.pdf|title=hinweis – November 2012|work=treuhandstelle-hh.de|date=|accessdate=2014-08-15|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140203210003/http://www.treuhandstelle-hh.de/files/Hinweis_2012_11.pdf|archivedate=2014-02-03|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Following on armed conflicts and natural catastrophes the Friends have thus far worked in Lebanon (2006, 2013), China (2008, 2013), Gaza (2009 – 2013), Indonesia (2009), Haiti (2010), Kirgistan (2010), Japan (2011), and Kenya (2012, 2013). They are members of the aid organisation Aktion Deutschland Hilft (ADH) and work in cooperation with partners such as the organisation [[Habitat for Humanity]] in Chile.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aktion-deutschland-hilft.de/de/fachthemen/katastrophenvorsorge/informationsaustausch/|title= Katastrophenvorsorge - Informationsaustausch zweier Mitgliedsorganisationen von Aktion Deutschland Hilft|publisher=Aktion Deutschland Hilft|date= |accessdate=2014-08-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.aktion-deutschland-hilft.de/en/member-organisations/friends-of-waldorf-education/|title= Friends of Waldorf Education Emergency Pedagogy Division|publisher= Aktion Deutschland Hilft|date=|accessdate=2014-08-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Fundamentals of Physics''''' is a [[calculus]]-based [[physics]] textbook by [[David Halliday (physicist)|David Halliday]], [[Robert Resnick]], and [[Jearl Walker]]. The textbook is currently in its tenth edition (published 2013). The current version is a revised version of the original 1960 textbook ''Physics for Students of Science and Engineering'' by Halliday and Resnick, which was published in two parts (Part I containing Chapters 1-25 and covering mechanics and thermodynamics; Part II containing Chapters 26-48 and covering electromagnetism, optics, and introducing quantum physics).  A 1966 revision of the first edition of Part I changed the title of the textbook to ''Physics''.&lt;ref&gt;Resnick &amp; Halliday, ''Physics'', Part I, rev. ed. (New York, London, and Sydney: John Wiley &amp; Sons, 1966), pp. v-vi, and Resnick &amp; Halliday, ''Physics for Students of Science and Engineering'', Part II, 2nd ed. (New York and London: John Wiley &amp; Sons, 1962), pp. xi-xv.&lt;/ref&gt; It is widely used in [[college]]s as part of the [[undergraduate]] physics courses, and has been well known to [[science]] and [[engineering]] students for decades as "the gold standard" of [[freshman]]-level physics texts. In 2002, the [[American Physical Society]] named the work the most outstanding introductory physics text of the 20th century.

The first edition of the book to bear the title ''Fundamentals of Physics'', first published in 1981, was revised from the original text by [[Farrell Edwards]] and [[John J. Merrill]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.physics.byu.edu/department/publications/merrill-0 Publications by John J. Merill], Brigham Young University&lt;/ref&gt; Walker has been the revising author since 1990.&lt;ref&gt;[http://facultyprofile.csuohio.edu/csufacultyprofile/detail.cfm?FacultyID=HRW Jearl D Walker], Profile page at CSU Ohio.&lt;/ref&gt;

* [[Special Relativity]]

The extended edition also contains introductions to topics such as [[quantum mechanics]], [[atomic theory]], [[solid-state physics]], [[nuclear physics]] and [[cosmology]]. A solutions manual and a study guide are also available.&lt;ref name="refname2"&gt;{{cite journal

[[File:Wuppertal - Katholische Hauptschule Bundesallee 01 ies.jpg|thumb|right|230px|Catholic Hauptschule in [[Wuppertal]], [[North Rhine-Westphalia]], [[Germany]].]]
A '''''Hauptschule''''' ({{IPA-de|ˈhaʊptʃuːlə|lang}}, "general school") is a [[secondary school]] in [[Germany]], starting after four years of [[Grundschule|elementary schooling]], which offers Lower Secondary Education (Level 2) according to the [[International Standard Classification of Education]]. Any student who attends a German [[elementary school]] can go to a ''Hauptschule'' or ''[[Gesamtschule]]'', while students who want to attend a ''[[Realschule]]'' or ''[[Gymnasium (Germany)|Gymnasium]]'' need to have good marks in order to do so. The students spend five to six years at the ''Hauptschule'', from 5th to 9th (or 10th) grade. They finish around age 15 to 17.

==History==
''Hauptschulen'' were first introduced in [[West Germany]] in 1950 and are now a part of secondary education in Germany, the other schools being the ''[[Gymnasium (school)|Gymnasium]]'' for the university-bound and the ''[[Realschule]]'' for the future technicians.

==Basics==
The main aim of ''Hauptschulen'' is to offer young students with average grades or below, most of whom will not attend a university, an adequate general academic education. (However some of the graduates will attend a university later in life, see below.) They largely teach the same subjects as a ''[[Realschule]]'' or ''[[Gymnasium (Germany)|Gymnasium]]'', but at a slower pace.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.howtogermany.com/pages/germanschools.html|title=How To Germany - German School System|author=|date=|website=www.howtogermany.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; Subjects that are taught at ''Gymnasien'', but not at ''Hauptschulen'', include Latin and Ancient Greek, while "introduction to the world of work" (''Arbeitslehre'') is taught at Hauptschulen, but not at ''Gymnasien''.

Subjects taught at a ''Hauptschule'' also include mathematics, physics/chemistry, biology, geography, history, religion (or a substitute subject), music, art, politics, sport and language. From the first year of ''Hauptschule'', all children learn English. Once students have obtained their leaving certificate at the age of 15/16, they can go into practical vocational training, start work in the public service at basic or secretarial level, or attend a ''Berufsfachschule'' (full-time vocational school). The jobs for which they apply consequently require practical skills rather than academic knowledge. They may also qualify for further education in a ''Realschule'' or ''Gymnasium'' if their marks are good enough.

Most ''Hauptschulen'' are state-run and thus do not cost any money to attend; however some private ''Hauptschulen'' do exist. Such ''Hauptschulen'' have comparatively low tuition fees and/or offer stipends. The "youth welfare office" may also cover the costs of the student attending a private ''Hauptschule''.

The German state spends more money on students attending public ''Hauptschulen'' than it spends on students attending public ''Realschulen'' or ''Gymnasien'', and ''Hauptschulen'' have a more favourable student-teacher-ratio than those other types of school.&lt;ref&gt;Klaus Klemm: "Bildungsausgaben im föderalen System – Zur Umsetzung der Beschlüsse des ‚Bildungsgipfels’". Friedrich Ebert Stiftung http://library.fes.de/pdf-files/stabsabteilung/06218.pdf p.41&lt;/ref&gt; ''Hauptschulen'' often have a very diverse student body in terms of ethnic groups, languages spoken at home, religions, social classes, and students' abilities. The schools face many challenges, because they sometimes have to educate students of average abilities alongside students that have learning difficulties or need special attention.&lt;ref&gt;Werner Helsper &amp; Christine Wiezorek: Zwischen Leistungsforderung und Fürsorge. Perspektiven der Hauptschule im Dilemma von Fachunterricht und Unterstützung. In: Die Deutsche Schule. 98 (4), 2006, p. 445 f.&lt;/ref&gt; In some German states, such as Bavaria, ''Hauptschulen'' offer different classes to their students. They offer the so-called M-classes for it advanced students, regular classes and the so-called P-classes for students who are struggling.

Percentage of jobholders holding ''[[Hauptschulabschluss]]'', ''[[Realschulabschluss]]'' or ''[[Abitur]]'' in Germany:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last = Frietsch | first = Rainer | date = November 2003 | title = "Intensivierung" von Bildungsabschlüssen zwischen 1970 – 2000 | journal = Studien zum deutschen Innovationssystem | issue = 5-2004 | issn = 1613-4338 | url = http://www.bmbf.de/pub/sdi_05_04_bildungsintensivierung.pdf | format = [[PDF]] | accessdate = 2009-11-21 | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://www.webcitation.org/5qovoV01d?url=http://www.bmbf.de/pub/sdi_05_04_bildungsintensivierung.pdf | archivedate = 2010-06-28 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Historically, a vast majority in Germany went to ''Hauptschule''; in 2000 54.5% of jobholders had an ''Hauptschulabschluss'', indicating they graduated from one. However, in the 1970s an educational expansion started and parents started sending their children to better schools. Thus younger jobholders are less likely to hold a ''[[Hauptschulabschluss]]'' than older ones.

==Problems==

The percentage of children attending a ''Hauptschule'' differs very much by region (it may be as high as 60% or as low as 4%). Most ''Hauptschulen'' reside in conservative areas (like Bavaria), because conservative parties want to strengthen the ''Hauptschule'', while the [[Social Democratic Party of Germany|SPD]] closed ''Hauptschulen'', replacing them with comprehensive schools. In these areas, in many cases, the Hauptschule is not a school of first choice for a student and is attended by students, of whom is believed that they for a number of reasons may not profit from the more competitive environment of other schools.

In some areas, where few students attend the ''Hauptschule'', and those who do often suffer from learning disabilities, ''Hauptschule'' students have come to be increasingly [[social stigma|stigmatized]] over the last years, the opinion of the general public often being that ''Hauptschulen'' only harbor the bottom end of society. Stereotypes of [[dysfunctional family]] backgrounds, absent and/or [[unemployment|unemployed]] parents and [[domestic violence]] and [[alcohol abuse]] are often cited when describing what is believed to be the typical social origin of these students. Teachers often complain about ongoing difficulties in trying to properly educate them and parents refusing to take responsibility. Moreover, and based on these problems, in some areas it has become very hard for ''Hauptschule'' graduates to find qualified work or begin an [[apprenticeship]], even in professions which traditionally welcomed them and in some areas have now shifted their focus to better qualified applicants, e.g. mechanics, construction or sales. In some areas, an overwhelming majority of each graduating class is therefore forced to accept low-paying unskilled labor or live on [[welfare (financial aid)|welfare]] indefinitely; many choose to stay in school for another year to obtain their diploma, which slightly, but not fundamentally, improves their career prospects. In 2006 a debate about violence at German Hauptschulen was sparked after teachers of the infamous [[Rütli School]] wrote a letter to the [[Senate of Berlin|senate]] office demanding the school to be closed down. The letter stated: 
:''We must realize that the mood in some classes currently is marked by aggressiveness, disrespect, and ignorance towards adults … The tendency toward violence against property is growing … In most of the families of our students, they are the only ones getting up in the morning. For them, school is a stage and battleground for attention. The worst culprits become role models''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.spiegel.de/international/0,1518,409876,00.html|title=Letter From Berlin: Germany's School of Hard Knocks|first=Marc|last=Young|date=5 April 2006|publisher=|via=Spiegel Online}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Baumert, Stanat and Watermann did a report on so called "problem schools" in 2000. "Problem schools" according to the scientist were:
:''Hauptschulen that exist in an underprivileged environment. There is a cumulation of risk factors. Half of all students have repeated a grade. [...] 40 percent of parents have not learnt a trade. One third of parents have no job. The percentage of students who destroyed school property is high. The level of aptitude and performance on test is very low. 16 percent of Hauptschulen must be called a problem school.''&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;Ulrich Sprenger: "Ergebnisse aus dem vierten Berichtsband zu PISA 2000-E (PISA-2000/06)" [http://www.schulformdebatte.de/contentbox/data/pisa_2000-06.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt;

The number of "problem schools" that could be identified varied greatly by State of Germany. In [[Bavaria]] no "problem school" could be found. In [[Baden-Württemberg]] only 4.8 percent of Hauptschulen and in [[Rheinland-Pfalz]] 8.7 percent of Hauptschulen must be called "problem schools". In contrast 60 percent of all Hauptschulen in [[Berlin]], 68.8 percent of Hauptschulen in [[Hamburg]] and 95.7 percent of all Hauptschulen that existed in [[Bremen]] must be called "problem schools".&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt; (Berlin and Hamburg have abolished the Hauptschule since then.)

The graduation certificate is the ''[[Hauptschulabschluss]]'', which like the assignment to other types high schools is less valuable than the ''[[Realschulabschluss]]'' or university-bound [[Abitur]]. 
Furthermore, persons holding a ''Hauptschulabschluss'' may go to night school  in order to earn their ''[[Realschulabschluss]]'' or [[Abitur]].
However, in some States of Germany students that do well enough in ''Hauptschule'' receive the ''[[Mittlere Reife]]''.  Students holding a ''Mittlere Reife'' are allowed to participate in classes at the Gymnasium. They can get their Abitur there.

==Hauptschule in different States of Germany==

Some States of Germany do not have a Hauptschule. In most Eastern German States, Hauptschulen never existed and still do not exist. In the [[German Democratic Republic]] most students attended a polytechnical school, and only a select few attended a specialist school. Nowadays, all Eastern German States offer some kind of "Intermediate School" (which may be called [[Regelschule]], [[Mittelschule]],  or [[Regionale Schule]]). It has to be pointed out that while those schools are called "intermediate schools", there are actually no "intermediate schools", because no school called "lower school" exists. Intermediate schools do not select students on aptitude. All States of Eastern Germany also offer [[Gymnasium (Germany)|Gymnasien]], while all but [[Saxony]] also offer comprehensive schools.

In the German state of Saarland, the Hauptschule has been abolished, and Hauptschulen have been merged with [[Realschule]]n to form "Erweiterte Realschulen", however those "Erweiterte Realschulen" still do stream by ability after 7th grade. They offer a fast and a slow track. The state of Schleswig-Holstein also abolished the Hauptschule and mainstreamed students into the [[Regionalschule]].

The state of [[Rhineland-Palatinate]] has merged Hauptschulen and [[Realschule]]n to form a new type of school called "Realschule plus", which offers general education classes (that resemble classes held at the normal Realschule) as well as remedial classes.

==Abolition of the Hauptschule in Berlin and Hamburg==

Starting in 2010/2011 Hauptschulen were formally abolished in the German States Berlin and Hamburg. They were merged with [[Realschule]]n and [[Gesamtschule]]n to form a new type of comprehensive school called ''Stadtteilschule'' in Hamburg and ''Sekundarschule'' in Berlin (see: [[Education in Berlin]], [[Education in Hamburg]]).

== Similarities to US schools ==
In the United States, most schools are [[comprehensive high school]]s and educate students of all ability ranges, as the concept of tracking by test score was largely abandoned there by the 21st century. However, some school districts, such as the [[Renton School District]], maintain separate schools for students who do not succeed in the comprehensive school, usually students who get the lowest test score results. Although most US students get uniform diplomas, some states are adopting [[high school graduation examination]]s with very high standards.

Although Marc Tucker of the [[NCEE]] designed the [[Certificate of Initial Mastery]] around the German education model, most US states expect all students to meet one high passing standard, and tests are used to ensure success for all rather than sorting between types of high schools. High school is mandatory until the age of 17–18 in most states, but those who leave before receiving a diploma are considered to be [[Dropping out|dropout]]s with a dismal future. All students, even those not going to college, must graduate with the skills necessary to succeed in college. It is thought that the incentive of losing a diploma will provide enough incentive to make that a reality, but some critics doubt that it was ever a practical idea. Students who do not pass the tests will receive no diploma or alternate documents that indicate that they do not meet the state's minimum standards for graduation.

"'''High-probability request sequence'''" is a term used to describe one of several strategies which are used by educators and others to promote and maintain appropriate behaviors in children and in adults with developmental [[Disability|disabilities]].

A "high-[[probability]] request" is a request to which the learner [[Compliance (psychology)|complies]] willingly under most conditions.  In contrast, a "low-probability request" is one that often results in a challenging or inappropriate behavior. The "high-probability request sequence" involves both kinds of requests.&lt;ref name=cooper&gt;Cooper, J. O., Heron, T. E., &amp; Heward, W. L. (2007). Applied behavior analysis (2nd ed.) Upper Saddle River, NJ: Merrill/Prentice Hall.&lt;/ref&gt;

When using this strategy, an [[Teacher|educator]] or parent first chooses a "target" behavior that is not usually performed when requested.&lt;ref name=houlihan&gt;Houlihan, D., Jacobson, L., &amp; Brandon, P. K. (1994). [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1297860/ Replication of a high-probability request sequence with varied interprompt times in a preschool setting.] Journal of Applied Behavior Analysis, 27, 737- 738.&lt;/ref&gt; Then he or she quickly asks the learner to do several tasks that he or she normally does willingly (the "high-probability requests"), followed immediately by an instruction that's more difficult or less popular (the "low-probability request").&lt;ref&gt;Santos, R. M. (2001). Using what children know to teach them something new: Applying high-probability procedures at home and in the preschool classroom. In Young Exceptional Children Monograph Series, 3.

'''Ida M. Eliot''' (1839–1923) was a writer, educator, philosopher, and [[entomologist]] who published one of the first books on [[caterpillars]], [https://books.google.com/books?id=6tE-AAAAYAAJ ''Caterpillars and Their Moths''] (1902) with Caroline Soule.

==Early life and career==
Eliot was born in 1839 in [[New Bedford, Massachusetts]] to Congressman [[Thomas D. Eliot]]. Eliot graduated from the Salem Normal School (now [[Salem State University]]) in [[Salem, Massachusetts]]. Eliot then moved to St. Louis, Missouri where her uncle, [[William Greenleaf Eliot]] was a prominent minister and philanthropist. In St. Louis after the Civil War, Eliot founded a school for freed [[African America]] students in a church basement.&lt;ref&gt;John Thomas Scharf, ''History of Saint Louis City and County: From the Earliest Periods to ...''
- 1883 - Saint Louis (Mo.), pg. 548 https://books.google.com/books?id=RIg6AQAAIAAJ&lt;/ref&gt; She served as assistant principal of the St. Louis Normal School ([[Harris-Stowe State College]]) under her close friend, [[Anna Brackett]]. Eliot and Brackett associated with the St. Louis [[Hegelianism|Hegelians]], and both later published philosophical works.{{sfn|Rogers|2005|p=73-74}} In 1872 when Anna Brackett resigned as principal, Eliot moved with Brackett to New York City. With Brackett, Eliot adopted a three-year-old daughter, Hope Davison, in 1873 and a second daughter, Bertha Lincoln, in 1875. In New York, Brackett and Eliot started The Brackett School for Girls, located at 9 West 39th Street, and they hired notable female teachers such as [[Mary Mitchell Birchall]], the first woman to receive a bachelor's degree from a New England college.&lt;ref&gt;The Century Illustrated Monthly Magazine, Volume 44, edited by Richard Watson Gilder, p.980&lt;/ref&gt; Eliot's adopted daughter, Hope, went on to graduate from college.&lt;ref&gt;America's First Women Philosophers: Transplanting Hegel, 1860–1925

Rogers, pg. 82&lt;/ref&gt; By 1900 Ida had moved back to New Bedford with her daughter, Ida, and sister Edith.&lt;ref&gt;1900 Census accessed on https://www.familysearch.org&lt;/ref&gt; Eliot died 1923 and was buried in [[New Bedford, Massachusetts]].&lt;ref&gt;https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/184467319/ida-mitchel-eliot&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Integrity Watch Afghanistan (IWA)''' is an Afghan [[non-governmental organization]] that works to increase [[transparency (social)]], [[integrity]] and [[accountability]] in [[Afghanistan]] through the provision of policy-oriented research, monitoring, capacity building and advocacy on [[political corruption]] and [[aid effectiveness]].

== History ==
IWA was created in October 2005 and developed a National Corruption Survey which measures Afghans' perspective on petty corruption. Prior to 2010 the Corruption Survey included only a few of the 34 provinces and was not able to give a national overview of the corruption situation in Afghanistan. In the 2010 National Corruption Survey, 32 out of the 34 [[provinces of Afghanistan]] were covered but the survey still faces some limitations as it was unable to survey areas that are in conflict and under pure [[Taliban]] control.

IWA's research measures the evolution of corruption trends and habits in Afghanistan and produces training tools to raise awareness about corruption. The organisation also works to strengthen local capacities to prevent corruption within the Afghan public institutions, private sector, civil society organisations and the public at large. IWA has three programmatic pillars: Community Based Monitoring, Public Service Monitoring and Extractive Industries Monitoring.

{{about||the  sexualized form of Japanese girls' school uniform|Kogal}}
[[File:Sailor-fuku for winter.jpg|thumb|A winter [[sailor suit|sailor fuku (sailor outfit)]] with long sleeves on a mannequin.]]
The '''Japanese school uniform''' is modeled in appearance similar to that of the European-style naval uniforms and was first used in Japan in the late 19th century, replacing the traditional kimono.&lt;ref name=chance&gt;{{cite web|url=https://chanceandphysics.com/2017/08/25/seifuku/|title=Seifuku|author=Katarina Kottonen|date=2017-08-25|publisher=Chance and Physics}}&lt;/ref&gt; Today, [[school uniform]]s are common in many of the Japanese public and private school systems. The [[Japan]]ese word for this type of [[uniform]] is {{Nihongo|'''''seifuku'''''|制服}}.

==History==
The gakuran and sailor-style dress have always been a part of Japan's "growing modern" culture due to it appearing formal and has existed as a concept. An official from Tombow Co., a manufacturer of the sailor fuku (sailor outfits), said that the Japanese took the idea from scaled down sailor suits worn by children of European [[Royal Family|royal families]]. The official said "In Japan, they were probably seen as adorable Western-style children’s outfits, rather than navy gear."&lt;ref name=Asahidecline&gt;"[https://www.japanbullet.com/life-style/schoolgirl-sailor-style-uniforms-on-decline Schoolgirl sailor-style uniforms on decline]." ''[[Asahi Shimbun]]'' / Japan Bullet. April 7, 2012. Retrieved on February 6, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; Sailor suits were adopted in Japan for girls because the uniforms were easy to sew. Old-fashioned textbooks state that the uniforms were based on the [[Imperial Japanese Army]] uniform rather than the said stated of the European. The sides of the uniform had similarity to existing styles of Japanese dressmaking, and the collar had straight lines. Many [[home economics]] classes in Japan up until the 1950s gave sewing sailor outfits as assignments. Girls sewed sailor outfits for younger children in their communities.&lt;ref name=Asahidecline/&gt;

In the 1980s ''[[sukeban]]'' gangs began modifying uniforms by making skirts longer and shortening the tops, and so schools began switching to [[blazer]] or [[sweater vest]] style uniforms&lt;ref name=chance /&gt; to try to combat the effect. As of 2012, 50% of Japanese junior high schools and 20% of senior high schools use sailor suit uniforms.&lt;ref name=Asahidecline/&gt;

The ''[[Asahi Shimbun]]'' stated in 2012 that "The sailor suit is changing from adorable and cute, a look that 'appeals to the boys,' to a uniform that 'girls like to wear for themselves.'"&lt;ref name=Asahidecline/&gt; As of that year, contemporary sailor suits have front closures with zippers or snaps and more constructed bodices. The ''Asahi Shimbun'' stated that "[t]he form is snug to enhance the figure—the small collar helps the head look smaller, for better balance".&lt;ref name=Asahidecline/&gt;

==Usage==
[[File:Uwabaki.jpg|thumb|In almost all schools, Japanese students are required to take off the shoes they wear outdoors and wear different indoor shoes. At some schools, students wear ''[[uwabaki]]'', a kind of soft slipper meant to be used only indoors.]]

The Japanese junior and senior-high-school uniform traditionally consists of a [[#Gakuran|military-styled uniform]] for boys and a [[#Sailor fuku|sailor outfit]] for girls. These uniforms are based on [[Meiji era]] formal military dress, themselves modeled on European-style naval uniforms. The sailor outfits replace the undivided [[hakama]] (andon bakama 行灯袴) designed by [[Utako Shimoda]] between 1920 and 1930.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hyogo-c.ed.jp/~kaibara-hs/gaiyo/100nen/33.htm 制服でたどる百年]&lt;/ref&gt; While this style of uniform is still in use, many schools have moved to more Western-pattern [[catholic school uniform]]  styles. These uniforms consist of a white shirt, tie, blazer with school crest, and tailored trousers (often not of the same color as the blazer) for boys and a white blouse, tie, blazer with school crest, and [[tartan]] culottes or skirt for girls.

Regardless of what type of uniform any particular school assigns its students, all schools have a summer version of the uniform (usually consisting of just a white dress shirt and the uniform slacks for boys and a reduced-weight traditional uniform or blouse and tartan skirt with tie for girls) and a sports-activity uniform (a polyester track suit for year-round use and a T-shirt and short pants for summer activities). Depending on the discipline level of any particular school, students may often wear different seasonal and activity uniforms within the same classroom during the day. Individual students may attempt to subvert the system of uniforms by wearing their uniforms incorrectly or by adding prohibited elements such as large [[loose socks]] or badges. Girls may shorten their skirts, permanently or by wrapping up the top to decrease length; boys may wear trousers about the hips, omit ties, or keep their shirts unbuttoned.

Since some schools do not have sex-segregated changing- or locker-rooms, students may change for sporting activities in their classrooms. As a result, such students may wear their sports uniforms under their classroom uniforms. Certain schools also regulate student hairstyles, footwear, and book bags; but these particular rules are usually adhered to only on special occasions, such as trimester opening and closing ceremonies and school photo days.

It is normal for uniforms to be worn outside of school areas, however this is going out of fashion and many students wear a casual dress.&lt;ref&gt;[http://keihanenglish.blogspot.com/2011/06/uniforms-japanese-fashion-everyone.html "Uniforms - The Japanese Fashion Everyone Loves"] (April 2011). ''[[Hiragana Times]]'', Volume 294, pp. 12–15.&lt;/ref&gt; While not many public elementary schools in Japan require uniforms, many private schools and public schools run by the central government still do so.

==Gakuran==
[[File:Ichikawa Gakuen school uniform.jpg|thumb|Museum exhibit of the uniforms of the [[Ichikawa Gakuen]] school. The middle mannequin is displaying a gakuran.]]
The {{Nihongo|''gakuran''|学ラン}} and the {{Nihongo|''tsume-eri''|詰襟}} are the [[uniform]]s for many middle-school and high-school boys in [[Japan]]. The color is normally black, but some schools use navy blue.

The top has a standing collar buttoning down from top-to-bottom. Buttons are usually decorated with the school emblem to show respect to the school. Pants are straight leg and a black or dark-colored belt is worn with them. Boys usually wear [[penny loafer]]s or [[sneakers]] with this uniform. Some schools may require the students to wear collar-pins representing the school and/or class rank.

The second button from the top of a male's uniform is often given away to a female he is in love with, and is considered a way of confession. The second button is the one closest to the heart and is said to contain the emotions from all three years attendance at the school. This practice was apparently made popular by a scene in a novel by [[Taijun Takeda]].

Traditionally, the gakuran is also worn along with a matching (usually black) [[student cap]], although this custom is less common in modern times.

The gakuran is derived from the Prussian [[Waffenrock]]. The term is a combination of ''gaku'' (学) meaning "study" or "student", and ''ran'' (らん or 蘭) meaning the [[Netherlands]] or, historically in Japan, [[Western world|the West]] in general; thus, ''gakuran'' translates as "Western student (uniform)". Such clothing was also worn by school children in [[South Korea]] and [[Republic of China (1912–1949)|pre-1949 China]].

==Sailor fuku== &lt;!-- This section is redirected to from [[Sailor fuku]] and linked to from [[Sailor Moon]] --&gt;
[[File:少女５.jpg|thumb|upright|Japanese junior schoolgirl in sailor suit]]
The {{Nihongo|sailor fuku|セーラー服|sērā fuku|Sailor outfits}} is a common style of uniform worn by female middle school students, traditionally by high school students, and occasionally, elementary school students. It was introduced as a school uniform in 1920 in {{Nihongo|Heian Jogakuin|平安女学院}}&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tombow.gr.jp/uniform_museum/style/change07.html 女子生徒に洋装制服登場、大正モダン] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090609055725/http://www.tombow.gr.jp/uniform_museum/style/change07.html |date=2009-06-09 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and 1921 by the principal of {{Nihongo|[[Fukuoka Jo Gakuin University]]|福岡女学院}},&lt;ref&gt;[http://design9.blog49.fc2.com/blog-entry-477.html 平安女学院（京都）と福岡女学院（福岡）の間で、セーラー服の起源を巡る論争が勃発！]&lt;/ref&gt; Elizabeth Lee. It was modeled after the uniform used by the [[Royal Navy|British Royal Navy]] at the time, which Lee had experienced as an exchange student in the [[United Kingdom]].

Much like the male uniform, the [[#Gakuran|gakuran]], the sailor outfits bears a similarity to various military styled [[naval]] uniforms. The uniform generally consists of a [[blouse]] attached with a sailor-style collar and a [[pleat]]ed [[skirt]]. There are seasonal variations for summer and winter: sleeve length and fabric are adjusted accordingly. A ribbon is tied in the front and laced through a loop attached to the blouse. Several variations on the ribbon include [[necktie]]s, [[bolo tie]]s, [[neckerchief]]s, and bows. Common colors are navy blue, white, grey, light green and black.

Shoes, socks, and other accessories are sometimes included as part of the uniform. These socks are typically navy or white.  The shoes are typically brown or black [[penny loafer]]s. Although not part of the prescribed uniform, alternate forms of legwear (such as [[loose socks]], knee-length stockings, or similar) are also commonly matched by more fashionable girls with their sailor outfits.

The sailor uniform today is generally associated solely with junior high schools, since a majority of (though by no means all) high schools have changed to more Western-style [[Catholic school uniform|plaid skirts]] or [[blazer]]s.

==Cultural significance==
[[File:制服 (5346443876).jpg|thumb|[[Kogal|''Kogal'' culture]]: Japanese schoolgirls wearing short skirts and [[loose socks]]]]
Various schools are known for their particular uniforms.  Uniforms can have a nostalgic characteristic for former students, and are often associated with relatively carefree youth. Uniforms are sometimes modified by students as a means of exhibiting individualism, including lengthening or shortening the skirt, removing the ribbon, hiding patches or badges under the collar, etc. In past decades, brightly coloured variants of the sailor outfits were also adopted by Japanese ''[[yankee#In other parts of the world|yankii]]'' and ''[[Bōsōzoku]]'' biker gangs.

Because school uniforms are a popular [[Schoolgirl uniform fetish|fetish item]], second-hand sailor outfits and other items of school wear are brokered through underground establishments known as ''[[burusera]]'', although changes to Japanese law have made such practices difficult. The pop group [[Onyanko Club]] had a provocative song called "[[Sailor Fuku o Nugasanai de|Don't Strip Off the Sailor Suit!]]".&lt;ref name ="Grigsby"&gt;Grigsby, Mary (1998).

'''Johan Willem van Hulst''' (28 January 1911 – 22 March 2018) was a Dutch school director, university professor, author and politician.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-43569049&lt;/ref&gt; In 1943, with the help of the [[Dutch resistance]] and students of the nearby [[University of Amsterdam]], he was instrumental in saving over 600 [[History of the Jews in the Netherlands|Jewish children]] from the nursery of the [[Hollandsche Schouwburg]] who were destined for deportation to [[Nazi concentration camps]]. For his [[Humanitarianism|humanitarian]] actions he received the [[Yad Vashem]] distinction [[Righteous Among the Nations]] from the [[Israel|State of Israel]] in 1973.

Van Hulst served as [[Senate (Netherlands)|Senator of the Netherlands]] from July 1956 to June 1981. He was elected to be the [[parliamentary leader]] of the [[Christian Historical Union]] (CHU) in the Senate from December 1968 until June 1977, when the CHU merged into the [[Christian Democratic Appeal]] CDA. He then became the first CDA Leader in the Senate. Van Hulst previously served as the [[party chair]] of the CHU from September 1969 until February 1972. He also was a [[Member of the European Parliament]] (MEP) for the [[European People's Party|Christian Democratic Group]] from October 1961 until September 1968.

He later was an ''emeritus'' professor of pedagogy at the [[VU University Amsterdam]] and a prolific author with more than a hundred publications. He was also a noted chess player.

==Early life==
Van Hulst was born on 28 January 1911 in Amsterdam, the son of Gerrit van Hulst and Geertruida Hofman. He studied psychology and [[pedagogy]] at the [[VU University Amsterdam]].

In the meantime he worked as a teacher and mentor in [[Oudewater]], [[Utrecht]] and [[Purmerend]].

==Rescue of Jewish children==
{{Righteous Among the Nations}}
In 1942 van Hulst was the director of the Reformed Teacher Training College, a Protestant religious seminary at Plantage Middenlaan 27, Amsterdam.&lt;ref name="yadVashem"/&gt;&lt;ref name="TimesISrael"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.timesofisrael.com/dutch-lawmaker-who-saved-hundreds-of-jewish-children-in-holocaust-dies-at-107/|title=Dutch lawmaker who saved hundreds of Jewish children in Holocaust dies at 107|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Across the street at Plantage Middenlaan 24 was the [[Hollandsche Schouwburg|Hollandse Schouwberg]] theatre, the main clearing site for the Jews living in Amsterdam who had been issued deportation notices by the Nazi government.&lt;ref name="Paldiel1993"&gt;{{cite book|author=Mordecai Paldiel|title=The Path of the Righteous: Gentile Rescuers of Jews During the Holocaust|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=YCz0J-8HIIMC&amp;pg=PA116|year=1993|publisher=KTAV Publishing House, Inc.|isbn=978-0-88125-376-4|pages=116–}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Children who arrived at the Schouwberg were separated from their families and sent to the neighbouring crèche at Plantage Middenlaan 31 run by [[Henriëtte Pimentel]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.joodsamsterdam.nl/henriette-pimentel-wie-een-mens-redt-redt-een-hele-wereld/|title=henriëtte pimentel / wie één mens redt, redt een hele wereld ''(who saves one person saves a whole world)''- joodsamsterdam|author=|date=|website=joodsamsterdam.nl|accessdate=30 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="TimesISrael"/&gt;  The créche shared a back garden with the college that van Hulst directed.&lt;ref name="TimesISrael"/&gt; 

Starting in January 1943, Pimentel and [[Walter Süskind]], a German Jew who had been appointed by the Nazis to run the Hollandsche Schouwberg operation,&lt;ref name="timesofisrael.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.timesofisrael.com/where-500-children-disappeared-from-nazi-clutches-a-new-dutch-shoah-museum-emerges/|title=Where 500 children ‘disappeared’ from Nazi clutches, a new Dutch Shoah museum emerges|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; began canvassing potential adoptive families for physical descriptions of children who could fit into their families without detection.&lt;ref name="companion"&gt;{{cite book|title=A Companion to Women's Military History|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=SbEyAQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA534|date=17 August 2012|publisher=BRILL|isbn=978-90-04-20682-3|pages=534–}}&lt;/ref&gt; Once the children's parents had agreed, the names of the children to be rescued were removed from the Nazi's registry of Jews who had passed through the Schouwberg theatre.&lt;ref name="BartropDickerman2017"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Paul R. Bartrop|author2=Michael Dickerman|title=The Holocaust: An Encyclopedia and Document Collection &amp;#91;4 volumes&amp;#93;|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=u4I2DwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA629|date=15 September 2017|publisher=ABC-CLIO|isbn=978-1-4408-4084-5|pages=629–}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Then, working with Pimentel, Süskind and dozens of other volunteers, Van Hulst arranged for the children to be spirited over the hedge separating the neighbouring back yards of the crèche and the teachers' college, often assisted by the teachers-in-training or local university students.&lt;ref name="BartropDickerman2017"/&gt;&lt;ref name="NR180430"&gt;{{cite web| url=https://www.nationalreview.com/magazine/2018/04/30/the-week-april-30-2018/ |publisher=''[[National Review]]'' |work=''National Review'' magazine |title=The Week |date=30 April 2018 |issue=30 April 2018 |volume=LXX |number=8 |p=11}}&lt;/ref&gt; When the time came to move the rescued children and babies away from the school, they would be hidden in containers such as bags, sacks or laundry baskets.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.spokesman.com/stories/2018/mar/28/johan-van-hulst-dutch-schoolteacher-who-saved-hund/|title=Johan van Hulst, Dutch schoolteacher who saved hundreds of Jewish children during Holocaust, dies at 107|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="TimesISrael"/&gt;

Numerous methods were used to move the hidden children from the school. In one method, the operation's helpers would wait for the moment a tram passed, blocking the view of Nazi guards at the facing Hollandsche Schouwberg, to cycle away with the hidden child.&lt;ref name="wapo"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/local/obituaries/johan-van-hulst-dutch-schoolteacher-who-saved-hundreds-of-jewish-children-during-holocaust-dies-at-107/2018/03/28/cdbd44c2-31ca-11e8-94fa-32d48460b955_story.html|title=Johan van Hulst, Dutch schoolteacher who saved hundreds of Jewish children during Holocaust, dies at 107|first=Ellie|last=Silverman|date=28 March 2018|publisher=|via=www.washingtonpost.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;  

The operation came to a halt on 29 September 1943 when the Nazis sent Pimentel and 100 children from the crèche to [[Nazi concentration camps]].&lt;ref name="companion"/&gt; Decades later, Van Hulst described his experience: "Now try to imagine 80, 90, perhaps 70 or 100 children standing there, and you have to decide which children to take with you. [...] That was the most difficult day of my life. [...] You know for a fact that the children you leave behind are going to die. I took 12 with me. Later on I asked myself: ‘Why not 13?'"&lt;ref name="yadVashem"&gt;[http://db.yadvashem.org/righteous/family.html?language=en&amp;itemId=4043272 The Righteous Among The Nations, Hulst van FAMILY] at yadvashem.org, accessed 30 March 2018.&lt;/ref&gt; Van Hulst thought twelve was the right number, otherwise the Germans would notice his plan and shut it down. In total, the operation had rescued between 500 and 1,000 Jewish babies and children.&lt;ref name="tablet"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tabletmag.com/scroll/259069/johan-van-hulst-righteous-among-the-nations-dies-at-107|title=Johan van Hulst, Righteous Among The Nations, Dies at 107|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Paldiel1993"/&gt;

Van Hulst received the [[Yad Vashem]] distinction in 1973.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.yadvashem.org/yv/en/righteous-linked/statistics/netherlands.pdf statistics/netherlands] at yadvashem.org&lt;/ref&gt; During a visit to the Netherlands in 2012, Israeli Prime Minister [[Benjamin Netanyahu]] said of Van Hulst: "We say, those who save one life saves a universe. You saved hundreds of universes. I want to thank you in the name of the Jewish people, but also in the name of humanity." Van Hulst replied, talking about the children he could not save: "I only can hope the angels may conduct you into paradise."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.jta.org/2018/03/26/news-opinion/johan-van-hulst-dutch-politician-saved-hundreds-jewish-children-holocaust-dies-107|title=Johan van Hulst, Dutch politician who saved hundreds of Jewish children during Holocaust, dies at 107 - Jewish Telegraphic Agency|website=www.jta.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2016, the former Reformed Teacher Training College became the Dutch National Holocaust Museum.&lt;ref name="timesofisrael.com"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://jck.nl/en/location/national-holocaust-museum|title=National Holocaust Museum - Jewish Cultural Quarter|website=jck.nl}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Shortly before his 107th birthday in 2018, Van Hulst gave an interview on Dutch television, talking about his experiences during the war.&lt;ref name="nosNL"&gt;[https://nos.nl/artikel/2214126-107-jarige-redde-honderden-joodse-kinderen-in-de-oorlog.html 107-jarige redde honderden joodse kinderen in de oorloog ''(107-year-old saved hundreds of Jewish children in the war)''] at nos.nl.&lt;/ref&gt;

From 1972 until 1981 Van Hulst was group leader in the Senate; first for the CHU and from 1977 on for the CDA.&lt;ref&gt;{{nl icon}} Parlement en Politiek [http://www.parlement.com/9353000/1f/j9vvhy5i95k8zxl/vg09ll1vufwd Dr. J.W. (Johan) van Hulst]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Party chair===
Van Hulst was elected as Chairman of the CHU on 5 October 1968 during the CHU party conference of 1968.

Van Hulst was tasked with preparing for the upcoming [[Dutch general election, 1971|general election of 1971]].

==Personal==
Van Hulst was an active chess player. At the age of 95 he won the Corus Chess Tournament for former politicians. He won it again in 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{nl icon}} schaaksite.nl [http://www.schaaksite.nl/2010/01/17/johan-van-hulst-99-jaar-wint-toernooi-parlementariers/ Johan van Hulst (99 jaar) wint toernooi parlementariërs ''(Johan van Hulst (99 years old) wins tournament (among?) members of parliament)'']&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Chess Vibes [http://www.chessvibes.com/columns/the-endgame-technique-of-a-99-year-old/ The endgame technique of a 99-year-old] 3 March 2010&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|language=Dutch|work= Man Bijt Hond|url=http://www.manbijthond.nl/fragmenten/max-euwe-werd-75-jaar-geleden-wereldkampioen-schaken |title=Max Euwe werd 75 jaar geleden wereldkampioen schaken ''(Max Euwe was world champion chess 75 years ago)''|date= 15 December 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

According to [[René van der Linden]], who served as President of the Senate of the Netherlands, Van Hulst was the first former member of the Senate to reach the age of 100 since the establishment of the upper house in 1815.&lt;ref&gt;{{nl icon}} [[Eerste Kamer der Staten-Generaal]] [http://www.eerstekamer.nl/nieuws/20110128/kamervoorzitter_feliciteert Kamervoorzitter feliciteert honderdjarige oud-senator Van Hulst ''(President of the Chamber congratulates centenary senator Van Hulst)''] 28 January 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
[[File:Lebanese International University (old logo).png|thumb|250px|The old LIU logo]]
The Lebanese International University was established in April, 2001, as "The Bekaa University" under Presidential Decree No.5294 as, with its grand campus constructed within the western region of the [[Beqaa Valley]]; at Al-Khyara, the West Beqaa (al-Beqaa al-Gharbi).

Having graduated its first Freshman class in June 2002, with a vision of becoming a true national university with international presence, a new campus in [[Beirut]] was opened and the name was changed to "Lebanese International University", or LIU in short. Another five campuses were later built: next to [[Sidon]] in south [[Lebanon]], Tyr, Nabatieh, Tripoli and Mount Lebanon.

LIU created buildings in Aden, [[Lebanese International University (Yemen)|Sana'a]] and Taiz in Yemen as well as two additional campuses in [[Lebanese International University (Mauritania)|Mauritania]] and [[Senegal]].

The Beirut campus is located within a residential area of Mouseitbeh in west Beirut. It consists of seven buildings, Blocks A to G.

The first building, as shown on the picture, is Block-A. This building is about five to six stories high, and the office of the campus manager can be found at the fifth floor.

The second building, Block-B, is much larger, and it is about eight stories high. Three stories below, the university has an underground parking space and two auditoriums. Major facilities for students, such as the registration office, the business office, and student affairs office, are located at the first floor of the building. The university cafeteria can also be found in this story.
The third building, Block-C, is almost the biggest building among the Blocks, it is about  nine stories high. Two stories below considered as parking, Block-C contains at his ninth floor the Mass Communication offices and Specialized Rooms as a Studio equipped with all the needed equipments for the students knowing that the Lebanese International University offers four different Bachelors in the Mass Communication department.

Starting Autumn 2011-2012, three new blocks will be founded to acquire the upcoming number of students, named as Block D, E &amp; G
made of five stories each, in addition to the dorms made for the transferring students moving from other campuses to Beirut.

'''Lee Joseph Cronbach''' (April 22, 1916 – October 1, 2001) was an American [[educational psychology|educational psychologist]] who made contributions to psychological testing and measurement.
At the University of Illinois, Urbana, Cronbach produced many of his works: the "Alpha" paper (Cronbach, 1951), as well as an essay titled The Two Disciplines of Scientific Psychology, in the [[American Psychologist]] magazine in 1957, where he discussed his thoughts on the increasing divergence between the fields of [[experimental psychology]] and correlational psychology (to which he himself belonged).

Cronbach was the president of the [[American Psychological Association]], president of the [[American Educational Research Association]], Vida Jacks Professor of Education at Stanford University and a member of the [[United States National Academy of Sciences]]. Cronbach is considered to be  "one of the most prominent and influential educational psychologists of all time." &lt;ref name ="Kupermintz"/&gt; A ''[[Review of General Psychology]]'' survey, published in 2002, ranked Cronbach as the 48th most cited psychologist of the 20th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Haggbloom |first=Steven J. |last2=''et al.'' |title=The 100 most eminent psychologists of the 20th century |journal=Review of General Psychology |volume=6 |issue=2 |year=2002 |pages=139–152 |doi=10.1037/1089-2680.6.2.139 |url=http://www.apa.org/monitor/julaug02/eminent.aspx |first2=Renee |last3=Warnick |first3=Jason E. |last4=Jones |first4=Vinessa K. |last5=Yarbrough |first5=Gary L. |last6=Russell |first6=Tenea M. |last7=Borecky |first7=Chris M. |last8=McGahhey |first8=Reagan |last9=Powell |first9=John L., III| displayauthors = 8 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Education and career==
Born in [[Fresno, California|Fresno]], [[California]], Cronbach was selected as a child to participate in [[Genetic Studies of Genius|Lewis Terman's long-term study of talented children]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Friedman|first=Howard|title=The Longevity Project|year=2011|publisher=Hudson Street Press|location=New York|isbn=978-1-59463-075-0|pages=76–77}}&lt;/ref&gt; He received a bachelor's degree from Fresno State College and a master's degree from the [[University of California, Berkeley]]. Cronbach had an interest in educational and psychological measurement due to Thurstone’s work on the measurement of attitudes.  This work of [[Thurstone]] intrigued Cronbach, motivating him to complete and receive his [[doctorate]] in [[educational psychology]] from the [[University of Chicago]] in 1940.&lt;ref name =Kupermintz&gt;Kupermintz, H. (2003). Lee J. Cronbach's contributions to educational psychology. In B. J. Zimmerman and D. H. Schunk (Eds.). ''Educational Psychology: A Century of Contributions'', pp. 289-302&lt;/ref&gt;

After teaching mathematics and chemistry at Fresno High School, Cronbach took faculty positions at the [[State College of Washington]] (now Washington State University), the University of Chicago, and the [[University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign|University of Illinois]], finally settling at [[Stanford University]] in 1964. In 1956 he was elected as a [[Fellow of the American Statistical Association]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.amstat.org/awards/fellowslist.cfm View/Search Fellows of the ASA], accessed 2016-07-23.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Contributions to educational psychology ==
Cronbach's research can be clustered into three main areas: measurement theory, program evaluation, and instruction.&lt;ref name=Shavelson&gt;Shavelson, R. J. (2003). Lee J. Cronbach. ''The American Philosophical Society'', 147(4), 380-385.&lt;/ref&gt; This includes several issues, such as the nature of the teaching-learning process, the measurement of variables describing instructional interactions, the evaluation of educational programs, and educational psychology’s aspiration as an emerging social science discipline. His contributions to measurement issues were of great importance to all educational psychologists. These contributions included improvements to the technology of psychometric modeling, as well as reformulations, which went beyond the mathematics of understanding the psychology of test performances.&lt;ref name ="Kupermintz"/&gt;

Educational psychologists have benefited from Cronbach's quest for a better explanation of learning in response to instruction; making countless contributions to educational psychology. Cronbach was able to sharpen the sensitivity of educational research, such as how different learners cope with the demands within different learning environments. He advocated the use of extensive local studies and field methods, producing useful narratives of teaching and learning.  Cronbach's contributions include refining research questions which seek to understand the person-situation interactions in educational settings, recognizing the abandonment of strict scientism is in favour of a more pluralistic philosophical and empirical agenda, and emphasizing that the role of context is just as essential as improved interpretations of educational processes. Cronbach developed a framework for evaluation design, implementation and analysis.&lt;ref name ="Kupermintz"/&gt; He believed that the purpose of evaluation to provide constructive feedback for program implementers and clients was incorrect. On the contrary, he believed that it was the design, implementation and analysis which should reflect the feedback goal.

Cronbach has proven that research is valuable {{Dubious-inline|reason=I don't think you can *prove* research is valuable per se|date=March 2015}} - to the extent where research serves the purpose of improving some aspect of social reality.  This allowed Cronbach to lay out guidelines - much like a road-map - for researchers and practitioners of educational psychology spreading awareness of the challenges and prospects of conducting program evaluations.&lt;ref name ="Kupermintz"/&gt;

"The special task of the social scientist in each generation is to pin down the contemporary facts. Beyond that, [Cronbach] shares with the humanistic scholar and the artist in the effort to gain insight into contemporary relationships, and to align the culture’s view of man with present realities. To know man as he is &lt;!-- not a mistake--&gt;is no mean aspiration." &lt;ref&gt;Cronbach, L. J. 1975. Beyond the two disciplines of scientific psychology. ''American Psychologist'' 30:671–84.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Cronbach's alpha ==
Cronbach worked on the concept of reliability which had a huge impact on the field of educational measurement. His earliest work was the publication of ''[[Cronbach's alpha]]''&lt;ref name =Cronbach1951&gt;Cronbach, L. J. (1951) (originally developed by Louis Guttman in 1945),. Coefficient alpha and the internal structure of tests. ''Psychometrika'', 16,297-334.&lt;/ref&gt; a method for determining the reliability of educational and psychological tests.  This allowed new interpretations of the index of reliability.  Cronbach had created this formula which could be applied throughout a variety of tests and other measurement instruments - gaining an enormous amount of popularity among practitioners.&lt;ref name ="Kupermintz"/&gt;  
Cronbach's Alpha provided a measure of reliability from a single test administration thus showing that on repeated occasions, or even other parallel forms of testing, were not needed to estimate a test's consistency (this followed closely from the works of  [[Kuder]] and Richardson). The Alpha is useful because  not only is it easily calculated, but it is also quite general and can be applied universally - for example: dichotomously scored multiple-choice items or polytimous attitude scales.&lt;ref name ="Shavelson"/&gt;

== The generalizability theory (the "G" theory) ==
As Cronbach’s work on reliability progressed, during the 1950s and 1960s it led to his work on the [[generalizability theory]]. He began his work with the aim to produce a handbook on measurement - allowing people to apply mathematical concepts to transform one’s behaviours and events into quantitative results.  Cronbach believed that there were two flaws in the concept of taking observed test scores into true score and error components: he believed that true scores were "ill-defined" and errors were "all-inclusive".  The Generalizability theory addresses the question of the relative influence on test performance based on different aspects of how tests are being administered to people. A question that would be addressed, for example, would be: "will students perform consistently on different occasions?" &lt;ref name ="Kupermintz"/&gt;

The Generalizability theory expanded when Cronbach became concerned that an undifferentiated error term covered up information about systematic variations which could be important in terms of test performance.  With this in mind, he teamed up with two other members and developed a "random model" (introduced by the British statistician [[R.A. Fisher]]) where he was determined to figure out the complexities of error variance.&lt;ref name ="Kupermintz"/&gt; This "G" theory thus provided a combination of the psychological with the mathematical producing a comprehensive framework and statistical model which identified sources of measurement error.&lt;ref name ="Shavelson"/&gt;

Cronbach's theory goes beyond examining consistency in a student’s relative standing in distribution – it recognizes and acknowledges that the particular item used in any given test is only a small indicator from a wider domain of knowledge. Only such extensions to reliability investigations were made possible by the Generalizability theory - which allowed researchers to address more realistic educational problems, and encouraged researchers to place substantial considerations when they made inquires to demonstrate that validity is important especially when evaluating information extracted from test scores.&lt;ref name ="Kupermintz"/&gt;

With the help from [[Paul Meehl]], Cronbach placed the concept of validity theory in the centre of educational and psychological testing.&lt;ref name ="Shavelson"/&gt; Cronbach &amp; Meehl believed that "...it [is]imperative that psychologists make a place for [advocating construct validity] in their methodological thinking, so that its rationale, its scientific legitimacy, and its dangers may become explicit and familiar. This would be preferable to the widespread current tendency to engage in what actually amounts to construct validation research and use of constructs in practical testing, while talking an "operational" methodology which, if adopted, would force research into a mold it does not fit." &lt;ref name =Meehl&gt;Cronbach, L. J., &amp; Meehl, P.E. (1955). Construct validity in psychological tests. ''Psychological Bulletin'', 52, 281-302.&lt;/ref&gt; Cronbach acknowledged reliability as an important characteristic of a test, but believed that reliability and validity went hand-in-hand,and at times, 'trade-offs' were necessary in order to improve reliability. The paper, ''Construct Validity in Psychological Tests'', compiled by both Cronbach and Meehl, represents their research efforts for over 50 years on validity.&lt;ref name="Shavelson"/&gt;

'''Mary Wollstonecraft''' (27 April 1759&amp;nbsp;– 10 September 1797) was an English writer, philosopher, and advocate of [[women's rights]]. During her brief career, she wrote novels, treatises, a [[travel literature|travel narrative]], a history of the [[French Revolution]], a [[conduct book]], and a children's book. Wollstonecraft is best known for ''[[A Vindication of the Rights of Woman]]'' (1792), in which she argues that women are not naturally inferior to men, but appear to be only because they lack education. She suggests that both men and women should be treated as rational beings and imagines a [[social order]] founded on reason.

Until the late 20th century, Wollstonecraft's life, which encompassed several unconventional personal relationships, received more attention than her writing. After two ill-fated affairs, with [[Henry Fuseli]] and [[Gilbert Imlay]] (by whom she had a daughter, [[Fanny Imlay]]), Wollstonecraft married the philosopher [[William Godwin]], one of the forefathers of the anarchist movement. Wollstonecraft died at the age of 38, eleven days after giving birth to her second daughter, leaving behind several unfinished manuscripts. This daughter, Mary Wollstonecraft Godwin, became an accomplished writer herself, as [[Mary Shelley]], whose best known work was ''[[Frankenstein]]''.

After Wollstonecraft's death, her widower published a ''[[Memoirs of the Author of A Vindication of the Rights of Woman|Memoir]]'' (1798) of her life, revealing her unorthodox lifestyle, which inadvertently destroyed her reputation for almost a century. However, with the emergence of the [[feminist movement]] at the turn of the twentieth century, Wollstonecraft's advocacy of women's equality and critiques of conventional femininity became increasingly important. Today Wollstonecraft is regarded as one of the founding [[feminist philosophy|feminist philosophers]], and feminists often cite both her life and work as important influences.

==Biography==

===Early life===
Wollstonecraft was born on 27 April 1759 in [[Spitalfields]], London. She was the second of the seven children of Elizabeth Dixon and Edward John Wollstonecraft.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Feminist papers: from Adams to de Beauvoir|first=Alice S. |last= Rossi | authorlink = Alice S. Rossi |year= 1988|publisher=Northeastern|page=25}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although her family had a comfortable income when she was a child, her father gradually squandered it on speculative projects. Consequently, the family became financially unstable and they were frequently forced to move during Wollstonecraft's youth.&lt;ref&gt;Tomalin, 9, 17, 24, 27; Sunstein, 11.&lt;/ref&gt; The family's financial situation eventually became so dire that Wollstonecraft's father compelled her to turn over money that she would have inherited at her maturity. Moreover, he was apparently a violent man who would beat his wife in drunken rages. As a teenager, Wollstonecraft used to lie outside the door of her mother's bedroom to protect her.&lt;ref&gt;Todd, 11; Tomalin, 19; Wardle, 6; Sunstein, 16.&lt;/ref&gt; Wollstonecraft played a similar maternal role for her sisters, Everina and Eliza, throughout her life. For example, in a defining moment in 1784, she convinced Eliza, who was suffering from what was probably [[postpartum depression]], to leave her husband and infant; Wollstonecraft made all of the arrangements for Eliza to flee, demonstrating her willingness to challenge social norms. The human costs, however, were severe: her sister suffered social condemnation and, because she could not remarry, was doomed to a life of poverty and hard work.&lt;ref&gt;Todd, 45–57; Tomalin, 34–43; Wardle, 27–30; Sunstein, 80–91.&lt;/ref&gt;

Two friendships shaped Wollstonecraft's early life. The first was with [[Jane Gardiner|Jane Arden]] in [[Beverley]]. The two frequently read books together and attended lectures presented by Arden's father, a self-styled philosopher and scientist. Wollstonecraft revelled in the intellectual atmosphere of the Arden household and valued her friendship with Arden greatly, sometimes to the point of being emotionally possessive. Wollstonecraft wrote to her: "I have formed romantic notions of friendship&amp;nbsp;... I am a little singular in my thoughts of love and friendship; I must have the first place or none."&lt;ref&gt;Quoted in Todd, 16.&lt;/ref&gt; In some of Wollstonecraft's letters to Arden, she reveals the volatile and depressive emotions that would haunt her throughout her life.&lt;ref&gt;See, for example, Todd, 72–75; Tomalin, 18–21; Sunstein, 22–33.&lt;/ref&gt; The second and more important friendship was with [[Fanny Blood|Fanny (Frances) Blood]], introduced to Wollstonecraft by the Clares, a couple in [[Hoxton]] who became parental figures to her; Wollstonecraft credited Blood with opening her mind.&lt;ref&gt;Todd, 22–24; Tomalin, 25–27; Wardle, 10–11; Sunstein, 39–42.&lt;/ref&gt;

Unhappy with her home life, Wollstonecraft struck out on her own in 1778 and accepted a job as a [[lady's companion]] to Sarah Dawson, a widow living in [[Bath, Somerset|Bath]]. However, Wollstonecraft had trouble getting along with the irascible woman (an experience she drew on when describing the drawbacks of such a position in ''[[Thoughts on the Education of Daughters]]'', 1787). In 1780 she returned home, called back to care for her dying mother.&lt;ref&gt;Wardle, 12–18; Sunstein 51–57.&lt;/ref&gt; Rather than return to Dawson's employ after the death of her mother, Wollstonecraft moved in with the Bloods. She realized during the two years she spent with the family that she had idealized Blood, who was more invested in traditional feminine values than was Wollstonecraft. But Wollstonecraft remained dedicated to her and her family throughout her life (she frequently gave pecuniary assistance to Blood's brother, for example).&lt;ref&gt;Wardle, 20; Sunstein, 73–76.&lt;/ref&gt;

Wollstonecraft had envisioned living in a female utopia with Blood; they made plans to rent rooms together and support each other emotionally and financially, but this dream collapsed under economic realities. In order to make a living, Wollstonecraft, her sisters, and Blood set up a school together in [[Newington Green]], a [[English dissenters|Dissenting]] community. Blood soon became engaged and after their marriage her husband, Hugh Skeys, took her to [[Lisbon]], Portugal, to improve her health, which had always been precarious.&lt;ref&gt;Todd, 62; Wardle, 30–32; Sunstein, 92–102.&lt;/ref&gt; Despite the change of surroundings Blood's health further deteriorated when she became pregnant, and in 1785 Wollstonecraft left the school and followed Blood to nurse her, but to no avail.&lt;ref&gt;Todd, 68–69; Tomalin, 52ff; Wardle, 43–45; Sunstein, 103–106.&lt;/ref&gt; Moreover, her abandonment of the school led to its failure.&lt;ref&gt;Tomalin, 54–57.&lt;/ref&gt; Blood's death devastated Wollstonecraft and was part of the inspiration for her first novel, ''[[Mary: A Fiction]]'' (1788).&lt;ref&gt;See Wardle, chapter 2, for autobiographical elements of ''Mary''; see Sunstein, chapter 7.&lt;/ref&gt;

==="The first of a new genus"===

[[File:MaryWollstonecraft.jpg|thumb|Mary Wollstonecraft in 1790–1, by [[John Opie]]]]

After Blood's death, Wollstonecraft's friends helped her obtain a position as [[governess]] to the daughters of the [[Anglo-Irish]] [[Baron Kingsborough|Kingsborough family]] in Ireland. Although she could not get along with Lady Kingsborough,&lt;ref&gt;See, for example, Todd, 106–07; Tomalin, 66; 79–80; Sunstein, 127–28.&lt;/ref&gt; the children found her an inspiring instructor; [[Margaret King]] would later say she "had freed her mind from all superstitions".&lt;ref&gt;Todd, 116.&lt;/ref&gt; Some of Wollstonecraft's experiences during this year would make their way into her only children's book, ''[[Original Stories from Real Life]]'' (1788).&lt;ref&gt;Tomalin, 64–88; Wardle, 60ff; Sunstein, 160–61.&lt;/ref&gt;

Frustrated by the limited career options open to respectable yet poor women—an impediment which Wollstonecraft eloquently describes in the chapter of ''[[Thoughts on the Education of Daughters]]'' entitled "Unfortunate Situation of Females, Fashionably Educated, and Left Without a Fortune"—she decided, after only a year as a governess, to embark upon a career as an author. This was a radical choice, since, at the time, few women could support themselves by writing. As she wrote to her sister Everina in 1787, she was trying to become "the first of a new genus".&lt;ref&gt;Wollstonecraft, ''The Collected Letters'', 139; see also Sunstein, 154.&lt;/ref&gt; She moved to London and, assisted by the liberal publisher [[Joseph Johnson (publisher)|Joseph Johnson]], found a place to live and work to support herself.&lt;ref&gt;Todd, 123; Tomalin, 91–92; Wardle, 80–82; Sunstein, 151–55.&lt;/ref&gt; She learned French and German and translated texts,&lt;ref&gt;Todd, 134–35.&lt;/ref&gt; most notably ''Of the Importance of Religious Opinions'' by [[Jacques Necker]] and ''Elements of Morality, for the Use of Children'' by [[Christian Gotthilf Salzmann]]. She also wrote reviews, primarily of novels, for Johnson's periodical, the ''[[Analytical Review]]''. Wollstonecraft's intellectual universe expanded during this time, not only from the reading that she did for her reviews but also from the company she kept: she attended Johnson's famous dinners and met such luminaries as the radical pamphleteer [[Thomas Paine]] and the philosopher [[William Godwin]]. The first time Godwin and Wollstonecraft met, they were disappointed in each other. Godwin had come to hear Paine, but Wollstonecraft assailed him all night long, disagreeing with him on nearly every subject. Johnson himself, however, became much more than a friend; she described him in her letters as a father and a brother.&lt;ref&gt;Tomalin, 89–109; Wardle, 92–94; 128; Sunstein, 171–75.&lt;/ref&gt;

While in London, Wollstonecraft pursued a relationship with the artist [[Henry Fuseli]], even though he was already married. She was, she wrote, enraptured by his genius, "the grandeur of his soul, that quickness of comprehension, and lovely sympathy".&lt;ref&gt;Quoted in Todd, 153.&lt;/ref&gt; She proposed a platonic living arrangement with Fuseli and his wife, but Fuseli's wife was appalled, and he broke off the relationship with Wollstonecraft.&lt;ref&gt;Todd, 197–98; Tomalin 151–52; Wardle, 171–73; 76–77; Sunstein, 220–22.&lt;/ref&gt; After Fuseli's rejection, Wollstonecraft decided to travel to France to escape the humiliation of the incident, and to participate in the revolutionary events that she had just celebrated in her recent ''[[Vindication of the Rights of Men]]'' (1790). She had written the ''Rights of Men'' in response to the Whig MP [[Edmund Burke]]'s conservative critique of the [[French Revolution]] in ''[[Reflections on the Revolution in France]]'' (1790) and it made her famous overnight. ''Reflections on the Revolution in France'' was published on 1 November 1790, and so angered Wollstonecraft that she spent the rest of the month writing her rebuttal. ''A Vindication of the Rights of Men, in a Letter to the Right Honourable Edmund Burke'' was published on 29 November 1790, initially anonymously;&lt;ref name="Furniss 60"&gt;Furniss 60&lt;/ref&gt; the second edition of ''A Vindication of the Rights of Men'' was published on 18 December, and this time the publisher revealed Wollstonecraft as the author.&lt;ref name="Furniss 60"/&gt;

Wollstonecraft called the French Revolution a "glorious ''chance'' to obtain more virtue and happiness than hitherto blessed our globe".&lt;ref name="Furniss 61"&gt;Furniss 61&lt;/ref&gt; Against Burke's dismissal of the Third Estate as men of no account, Wollstonecraft wrote: "Time many show, that this obscure throng knew more of the human heart and of legislation than the profligates of rank, emasculated by hereditary effeminacy".&lt;ref name="Furniss 61"/&gt; About the events of 5–6 October 1789, when the royal family was marched from Versailles to Paris by a group of angry housewives, Burke praised Queen Marie Antoinette as a symbol of the refined elegance of the ''ancien régime'', who was surrounded by "furies from hell, in the abused shape of the vilest of women".&lt;ref name="Furniss 61"/&gt; Wollstonecraft by contrast wrote of the same event: "Probably you [Burke] mean women who gained a livelihood by selling vegetables or fish, who never had any advantages of education".&lt;ref name="Furniss 61"/&gt;

Wollstonecraft was compared with such leading lights as the theologian and controversialist [[Joseph Priestley]] and Paine, whose ''[[Rights of Man]]'' (1791) would prove to be the most popular of the responses to Burke. She pursued the ideas she had outlined in ''Rights of Men'' in ''[[A Vindication of the Rights of Woman]]'' (1792), her most famous and influential work.&lt;ref&gt;Tomalin, 144–55; Wardle, 115ff; Sunstein, 192–202.&lt;/ref&gt; Wollstonecraft's fame extended across the English channel, for when the French statesmen [[Charles Maurice de Talleyrand-Périgord]] visited London in 1792, he visited her, during which she asked that French girls be given the same right to an education that French boys were being offered by the new regime in France.&lt;ref&gt;Furniss 63&lt;/ref&gt;

===France and Gilbert Imlay===

Wollstonecraft left for Paris in December 1792 and arrived about a month before [[Execution of Louis XVI|Louis XVI was guillotined]]. Britain and France were on the brink of war when she left for Paris, and many advised her not to go.&lt;ref&gt;Furniss 64.&lt;/ref&gt; France was in turmoil. She sought out other British visitors such as [[Helen Maria Williams]] and joined the circle of expatriates then in the city.&lt;ref&gt;Todd, 214–15; Tomalin, 156–82; Wardle, 179–84.&lt;/ref&gt; On 26 December 1792, Wollstonecraft saw the former king, Louis XVI, being taken to be tried before the National Assembly, and much to her own surprise, found the sight of Louis riding down the streets as a prisoner in a wagon "made the tears flow insensibly from my eyes, when I saw Louis sitting, with more dignity than I expected from his character, in a hackney coach going to meet death, where so many of his race have triumphed".&lt;ref name="Furniss 65"&gt;Furniss 65.&lt;/ref&gt; During her time in Paris, Wollstonecraft associated mostly with the moderate [[Girondins]] rather than the more radical [[Jacobins]].&lt;ref name="Furniss 65"/&gt;

In February 1793, France declared war on Britain, and Wollstonecraft attempted to leave France for Switzerland, but was declined permission.&lt;ref name="Furniss 68"&gt;Furniss 68.&lt;/ref&gt; In March 1793, the Jacobin-dominated Committee of Public Safety came to power in France, instituting a totalitarian regime meant to mobilise France for the first "total war", and life become very difficult for foreigners in France.&lt;ref name="Furniss 66"&gt;Furniss 66.&lt;/ref&gt; All foreigners living in France were put under police surveillance, had to produce six written statements from Frenchmen testifying to their loyalty to the republic in order to be granted residency permits, and on 12 April 1793 all foreigners were forbidden to leave France.&lt;ref name="Furniss 67"&gt;Furniss 67.&lt;/ref&gt; Despite her sympathy for the revolution, life for Wollstonecraft become very uncomfortable, all the more so as the Girondins had lost out to the Jacobins.&lt;ref name="Furniss 67"/&gt; Some of Wollstonecraft's French friends lost their heads to the guillotine as the Jacobins set out to annihilate all of their enemies.&lt;ref name="Furniss 67"/&gt;

Having just written the ''Rights of Woman'', Wollstonecraft was determined to put her ideas to the test, and in the stimulating intellectual atmosphere of the [[French revolution]] she attempted her most experimental romantic attachment yet: she met and fell passionately in love with [[Gilbert Imlay]], an American adventurer. Wollstonecraft put her own principles in practice by sleeping with Imlay despite not being married, which was not something that was considered acceptable behavior from a "respectable" British woman at the time.&lt;ref name="Furniss 67"/&gt; Whether or not she was interested in marriage, he was not, and she appears to have fallen in love with an idealized portrait of the man. While Wollstonecraft had rejected the sexual component of relationships in the ''Rights of Woman'', Imlay awakened her passions and her interest in sex.&lt;ref&gt;Todd, 232–36; Tomalin, 185–86; Wardle, 185–88; Sunstein, 235–45.&lt;/ref&gt; Wollstonecraft was to a certain extent disillusioned by what she saw in France, writing that the people under the republic were still behaved slavishly to those who held power while the government remained "venal" and "brutal".&lt;ref name="Furniss 66"/&gt; Despite her disenchantment, Wollstonecraft wrote: "I cannot yet give up the hope, that a fairer day is dawning on Europe, though I must hesitatingly observe, that little is to be expected from the narrow principle of commerce, which seems everywhere to be shoving aside ''the principle of honor'' of the ''noblesse''. For the same pride of office, the same desire of power are still visible; with this aggravation, that, fearing to return to obscurity, after having but just acquired a relish for distinction, each hero, or philosopher, for all are dubbed with these new titles, endeavors to make hay while the sun shines."&lt;ref name="Furniss 66"/&gt; Wollstonecraft was offended by the way that the Jacobins refused to grant Frenchwomen equal rights, denounced "Amazons", and made it clear the role of women was to conform to Rousseau's ideal of as a helper to men.&lt;ref name="Gordon 215"&gt;Gordon 215.&lt;/ref&gt; On 16 October 1793, Marie Antoinette was guillotined with one of the charges that she been convicted of being she had committed incest with her son.&lt;ref name="Gordon 214–215"&gt;Gordon 214–215.&lt;/ref&gt; Though Wollstonecraft disliked the former queen, she was troubled by the way that the Jacobins had made Marie Antoinette's alleged perverted sexuality that had caused her to engage in an incestuous relationship with the Dauphin one of the central reasons for why the French people should hate her.&lt;ref name="Gordon 215"/&gt; On 31 October 1793, most of the Girondin leaders were guillotined, which caused Wollstonecraft to faint when Imlay broke the news to her.&lt;ref name="Gordon 214–215"/&gt;

To protect Wollstonecraft, Imlay registered her as his wife in 1793, even though they were not married.&lt;ref&gt;St Clair, 160; Wardle, 192–93; Sunstein, 262–63.&lt;/ref&gt; After declaring war on Britain, France was blockaded by the Royal Navy, which caused shortages that worsened the problem of inflation.&lt;ref name="Gordon 215"/&gt; Imlay engaged in blockade-running, chartering ships to bring in food and soap from America into France, which explained why both he and Wollstonecraft were not arrested during the Reign of Terror.&lt;ref&gt;Gordon 215 &amp; 224.&lt;/ref&gt; As the Terror began in France with arrests and executions occurring daily, Wollstonecraft came under suspicion as someone from a nation that was at war with France and who was known to be a friend of leading Girondins, which led Imlay to make a false statement to the U.S. embassy in Paris that he had married her, automatically making her into an American citizen, in order to protect her from arrest.&lt;ref name="Furniss 67"/&gt; Some of her friends were not so lucky; many, like Thomas Paine, were arrested, and some were even guillotined (Wollstonecraft's sisters believed she had been imprisoned). Wollstonecraft called life under the Jacobins "nightmarish" with gigantic parades in the day where everyone had to cheer, lest they fall under suspicion of not being committed to the republic, and police raids at night to arrest "enemies of the republic".&lt;ref name="Furniss 67"/&gt; In a letter to her sister Everina, written in March 1794, Wollstonecraft wrote: &lt;blockquote&gt;It is impossible for you to have any idea of the impression the sad scenes I have been a witness to have left on my mind...death and misery, in every shape of terrour, haunts this devoted country – I certainly am glad that I came to France, because I never could have had else a just opinion of the most extraordinary event that has ever been recorded.&lt;ref name="Furniss 67"/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Wollstonecraft soon became pregnant by Imlay, and on 14 May 1794 she gave birth to her first child, [[Fanny Imlay|Fanny]], naming her after perhaps her closest friend.&lt;ref&gt;Tomalin, 218; Wardle, 202–03; Sunstein, 256–57.&lt;/ref&gt; Wollstonecraft was overjoyed; she wrote to a friend: "My little Girl begins to suck so MANFULLY that her father reckons saucily on her writing the second part of the R[igh]ts of Woman" (emphasis hers).&lt;ref&gt;Qtd. in Wardle, 202.&lt;/ref&gt; She continued to write avidly, despite not only her pregnancy and the burdens of being a new mother alone in a foreign country, but also the growing tumult of the French Revolution. While at [[Le Havre]] in northern France, she wrote a history of the early revolution, ''An Historical and Moral View of the French Revolution'', which was published in London in December 1794.&lt;ref&gt;Tomalin, 211–19; Wardle, 206–14; Sunstein, 254–55.&lt;/ref&gt; Imlay, unhappy with the domestic-minded and maternal Wollstonecraft, eventually left her. He promised that he would return to Le Havre where she went to give birth to her child, but his delays in writing to her and his long absences convinced Wollstonecraft that he had found another woman. Her letters to him are full of needy expostulations, explained by most critics as the expressions of a deeply depressed woman but by some as a result of her circumstances—alone with an infant in the middle of a revolution.&lt;ref&gt;Todd, Chapter 25; Tomalin, 220–31; Wardle, 215ff; Sunstein, 262ff.&lt;/ref&gt;

In July 1794, Wollstonecraft welcomed the fall of the Jacobins, predicting this would be followed with a restoration of freedom of press in France, which led her to return to Paris.&lt;ref name="Furniss 67"/&gt; In August 1794, Imlay departed for London and promised to return soon.&lt;ref name="Furniss 67"/&gt; The winter of 1794–95 was the coldest winter in Europe for over a century, which reduced Wollstonecraft and her daughter Fanny down to desperate circumstances.&lt;ref&gt;Furniss 67–68.&lt;/ref&gt; The river Seine froze that winter, which made it impossible for ships to bring food and coal to Paris, leading to widespread starvation and deaths from the cold in that city.&lt;ref&gt;Gordon 243.&lt;/ref&gt; Wollstonecraft continued to write to Imlay, asking him to return to France at once, declaring she still had faith in the revolution and did not wish to return to Britain.&lt;ref name="Furniss 68"/&gt; In 1793, the British government began a crackdown on radicals, suspending civil liberties, imposing drastic censorship, and trying for treason all suspected of sympathy with the revolution, which led Wollstonecraft to fear she would be imprisoned if she returned.&lt;ref name="Furniss 68"/&gt; After she left France on 7 April 1795, she continued to refer to herself as "Mrs Imlay", even to her sisters, in order to bestow legitimacy upon her child.&lt;ref&gt;Tomalin, 225.&lt;/ref&gt;

The British historian Tom Furniss called ''An Historical and Moral View of the French Revolution'' the most neglected of Wollstonecraft's books, which was first published in London in 1794, and a second edition did not appear until 1989.&lt;ref name="Furniss 68"/&gt; The reason for this neglect is later generations were more interested in her feminist writings rather her account of the French Revolution, which Furniss regretted as he called ''An Historical and Moral View of the French Revolution'' easily Wollstonecraft's  "best work".&lt;ref name="Furniss 68"/&gt; Wollstonecraft was not trained as a historian, but she used all sorts of journals, letters and documents recounting how ordinary people in France reacted to the Revolution, and attempted to counter-act what Furniss called the "hysterical" anti-revolutionary mood in Britain, which depicted the Revolution as due to the entire French nation apparently all going mad.&lt;ref name="Furniss 68"/&gt; Wollstonecraft argued that the revolution was not due to the French people all going insane in 1789 as popular opinion in Britain held, but was due to a set of social, economic and political conditions that left no other way out of the crisis that gripped France in 1789.&lt;ref name="Furniss 68"/&gt;  ''An Historical and Moral View of the French Revolution'' presented a difficult balancing act for Wollstonecraft as she condemned the Jacobin regime and the Reign of Terror, but at same time, she continued to argue that revolution was a great achievement, which led her to stop her history in late 1789 rather than write about the Terror of 1793–94.&lt;ref&gt;Furniss 68–69.&lt;/ref&gt; Burke had ended the ''Reflections'' with reference to the events of 5–6 October 1789, when a group of women from Paris forced the French royal family from the Palace of Versailles to Paris.&lt;ref&gt;Furniss 72.&lt;/ref&gt; Burke called the women "furies from hell" while Wollstonecraft called the women just merely ordinary housewives angry about a lack of bread to feed their families.&lt;ref name="Furniss 68"/&gt; Against Burke's idealised portrait of Marie Antoinette as a noble victim of a mob, Wollstonecraft portrayed the queen as a ''femme fatale'', a seductive, scheming and dangerous woman.&lt;ref name="Callender 384"&gt;Callender 384&lt;/ref&gt; Wollstonecraft argued that the values of the aristocracy were corrupting ones for women since in a monarchy, the main purpose of a woman was to bear sons to continue the house, which essentially reduced a woman's value down to her womb.&lt;ref name="Callender 384"/&gt; Moreover, Wollstonecraft argued unless a queen was a queen regnant, most queens were queen consorts, which meant a woman to exercise influence via her husband or son, which encouraged manipulative behavior. Wollstonecraft argued that aristocratic values by emphasising the value of a woman's body and her ability to be charming over the value of her mind and character had encouraged women like Marie Antoinette to be manipulative and ruthless, making the queen into a corrupted and corrupting product of the ''ancien régime''.&lt;ref name="Callender 384"/&gt;

===England and William Godwin===
Seeking Imlay, Wollstonecraft returned to London in April 1795, but he rejected her. In May 1795 she attempted to commit suicide, probably with [[laudanum]], but Imlay saved her life (although it is unclear how).&lt;ref&gt;Todd, 286–87; Wardle, 225.&lt;/ref&gt; In a last attempt to win back Imlay, she embarked upon some business negotiations for him in Scandinavia, trying to recoup some of his losses. Wollstonecraft undertook this hazardous trip with only her young daughter and a maid. She recounted her travels and thoughts in letters to Imlay, many of which were eventually published as ''[[Letters Written in Sweden, Norway, and Denmark|Letters Written During a Short Residence in Sweden, Norway, and Denmark]]'' in 1796.&lt;ref&gt;Tomalin, 225–31; Wardle, 226–44; Sunstein, 277–90.&lt;/ref&gt; When she returned to England and came to the full realization that her relationship with Imlay was over, she attempted suicide for the second time, leaving a note for Imlay:

{{quote|Let my wrongs sleep with me! Soon, very soon, shall I be at peace. When you receive this, my burning head will be cold&amp;nbsp;... I shall plunge into the Thames where there is the least chance of my being snatched from the death I seek. God bless you! May you never know by experience what you have made me endure. Should your sensibility ever awake, remorse will find its way to your heart; and, in the midst of business and sensual pleasure, I shall appear before you, the victim of your deviation from rectitude.&lt;ref&gt;Wollstonecraft, ''The Collected Letters'', 326–327.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

[[File:WilliamGodwin.jpg|thumb|left|alt=Half-length profile portrait of a man. His dark clothing blends into the background and his white face is in stark contrast.|[[James Northcote (painter)|James Northcote]], ''[[William Godwin]],'' oil on canvas, 1802, the [[National Portrait Gallery (London)|National Portrait Gallery]]]]
She then went out on a rainy night and "to make her clothes heavy with water, she walked up and down about half an hour" before jumping into the [[River Thames]], but a stranger saw her jump and rescued her.&lt;ref&gt;Todd, 355–56; Tomalin, 232–36; Wardle, 245–46.&lt;/ref&gt; Wollstonecraft considered her suicide attempt deeply rational, writing after her rescue, &lt;blockquote&gt;I have only to lament, that, when the bitterness of death was past, I was inhumanly brought back to life and misery. But a fixed determination is not to be baffled by disappointment; nor will I allow that to be a frantic attempt, which was one of the calmest acts of reason. In this respect, I am only accountable to myself. Did I care for what is termed reputation, it is by other circumstances that I should be dishonoured.&lt;ref&gt;Todd, 357.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Gradually, Wollstonecraft returned to her literary life, becoming involved with [[Joseph Johnson (publisher)|Joseph Johnson's]] circle again, in particular with [[Mary Hays]], [[Elizabeth Inchbald]], and [[Sarah Siddons]] through [[William Godwin]]. Godwin and Wollstonecraft's unique courtship began slowly, but it eventually became a passionate love affair.&lt;ref&gt;St. Clair, 164–69; Tomalin, 245–70; Wardle, 268ff; Sunstein, 314–20.&lt;/ref&gt; Godwin had read her ''Letters Written in Sweden, Norway, and Denmark'' and later wrote that "If ever there was a book calculated to make a man in love with its author, this appears to me to be the book. She speaks of her sorrows, in a way that fills us with melancholy, and dissolves us in tenderness, at the same time that she displays a genius which commands all our admiration."&lt;ref name="Godwin95"/&gt; Once Wollstonecraft became pregnant, they decided to marry so that their child would be legitimate. Their marriage revealed the fact that Wollstonecraft had never been married to Imlay, and as a result she and Godwin lost many friends. Godwin received further criticism because he had advocated the abolition of marriage in his philosophical treatise ''[[Political Justice]]''.&lt;ref&gt;St. Clair, 172–74; Tomalin, 271–73; Sunstein, 330–35.&lt;/ref&gt; After their marriage on 29 March 1797, Godwin and Wollstonecraft moved to 29 The Polygon, [[Somers Town, London|Somers Town]]. Godwin rented an apartment 20 doors away at 17 Evesham Buildings in Chalton Street as a study, so that they could both still retain their independence; they often communicated by letter.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Carl Pforzheimer Library|authorlink1=Carl Pforzheimer|editor1-last=Cameron|editor1-first=Kenneth Neill|editor2-last=Reiman|editor2-first=Donald H.|title=Shelley and His Circle, 1773–1822, Volume 1|date=1961|publisher=Harvard University Press|page=185|url=https://books.google.com.au/books?id=NY-CUysZc8AC&amp;pg=PA185|accessdate=1 May 2018|chapter=The Death of Mary Wollstonecraft}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Sunstein has printed several of these letters in order so that the reader can follow Wollstonecraft and Godwin's conversation (321ff.)&lt;/ref&gt; By all accounts, theirs was a happy and stable, though brief, relationship.&lt;ref&gt;St. Clair, 173; Wardle, 286–92; Sunstein, 335–40.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Death and Godwin's ''Memoirs''===
[[File:GodwinMemoirs.jpg|right|thumb|alt=Title page reads "Memoirs of the Author of A Vindication of the Rights of Woman. By William Godwin. The Second Edition, Corrected. London: Printed for J. Johnson, No. 72, St. Paul's Church-yard. 1798.|Title page for [[William Godwin|Godwin's]] ''[[Memoirs of the Author of A Vindication of the Rights of Woman]]'' (1798)]]

On 30 August 1797, Wollstonecraft gave birth to her second daughter, [[Mary Shelley|Mary]]. Although the delivery seemed to go well initially, the [[placenta]] broke apart during the birth and became infected; [[puerperal (childbed) fever]] was a common and often fatal occurrence in the eighteenth century.&lt;ref&gt;Gordon, 356&lt;/ref&gt; After several days of agony, Wollstonecraft died of [[septicaemia]] on 10 September.&lt;ref&gt;Todd, 450–56; Tomalin, 275–83; Wardle, 302–06; Sunstein, 342–47.&lt;/ref&gt; Godwin was devastated: he wrote to his friend [[Thomas Holcroft]], "I firmly believe there does not exist her equal in the world. I know from experience we were formed to make each other happy. I have not the least expectation that I can now ever know happiness again."&lt;ref&gt;Quoted in C. Kegan Paul, ''[http://dwardmac.pitzer.edu/anarchist_Archives/godwin/friends/toc.html William Godwin: His Friends and Contemporaries]'', London: Henry S. King and Co. (1876). Retrieved 11 March 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; She was buried at [[St Pancras Old Church|Old Saint Pancras Churchyard]], where her tombstone reads, "Mary Wollstonecraft Godwin, Author of ''A Vindication of the Rights of Woman'': Born 27 April 1759: Died 10 September 1797."&lt;ref&gt;Todd, 457.&lt;/ref&gt; (In 1851, her remains were moved by her grandson [[Percy Florence Shelley]] to his family tomb in [[St Peter's Church, Bournemouth]].)&lt;ref&gt;Gordon, 446.&lt;/ref&gt; Her monument in the churchyard lies to the north-east of the church just north of [[Sir John Soane]]'s grave. Her husband was buried with her on his death in 1836, as was his second wife, Mary Jane Godwin (1766–1841).

In January 1798 Godwin published his ''[[Memoirs of the Author of A Vindication of the Rights of Woman]]''. Although Godwin felt that he was portraying his wife with love, compassion, and sincerity, many readers were shocked that he would reveal Wollstonecraft's illegitimate children, love affairs, and suicide attempts.&lt;ref&gt;St. Clair, 182–88; Tomalin, 289–97; Sunstein, 349–51; Sapiro, 272.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Romanticism|Romantic]] poet [[Robert Southey]] accused him of "the want of all feeling in stripping his dead wife naked" and vicious satires such as ''[[The Unsex'd Females]]'' were published.&lt;ref&gt;[[Robert Southey]] to [[William Taylor (man of letters)|William Taylor]], 1 July 1804. ''A Memoir of the Life and Writings of William Taylor of Norwich''. Ed. J. W. Robberds. 2 vols. London: John Murray (1824) 1:504.&lt;/ref&gt; Godwin's ''Memoirs'' portrays Wollstonecraft as a woman deeply invested in feeling who was balanced by his reason and as more of a religious sceptic than her own writings suggest.&lt;ref&gt;Sapiro, 273–74.&lt;/ref&gt; Godwin's views of Wollstonecraft were perpetuated throughout the nineteenth century and resulted in poems such as "Wollstonecraft and Fuseli" by British poet [[Robert Browning]] and that by [[William Roscoe]] which includes the lines:&lt;ref&gt;Quoted in Sapiro, 273.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;poem&gt;
:Hard was thy fate in all the scenes of life
:As daughter, sister, mother, friend, and wife;
:But harder still, thy fate in death we own,
:Thus mourn'd by Godwin with a heart of stone.
&lt;/poem&gt;

Wollstonecraft has what scholar Cora Kaplan labelled in 2002 a "curious" legacy that has evolved over time: "for an author-activist adept in many genres&amp;nbsp;... up until the last quarter-century Wollstonecraft's life has been read much more closely than her writing".&lt;ref&gt;Kaplan, "Wollstonecraft's reception", 247.&lt;/ref&gt; After the devastating effect of Godwin's ''Memoirs'', Wollstonecraft's reputation lay in tatters for nearly a century; she was pilloried by such writers as [[Maria Edgeworth]], who patterned the "freakish" Harriet Freke in ''[[Belinda (Edgeworth novel)|Belinda]]'' (1801) after her. Other novelists such as [[Mary Hays]], [[Charlotte Turner Smith]], [[Fanny Burney]], and [[Jane West]] created similar figures, all to teach a "moral lesson" to their readers.&lt;ref&gt;Favret, 131–32.&lt;/ref&gt; (Hays had been a close friend, and helped nurse her in her dying days.)&lt;ref name=Pennell&gt;[[Elizabeth Robins Pennell|Pennell, Elizabeth Robins]]. ''Life of Mary Wollstonecraft'' (Boston: Roberts Brothers, 1884), 351. [https://archive.org/details/lifemarywollsto03penngoog Full text.]&lt;/ref&gt;

In contrast, there was one writer of the generation after Wollstonecraft who apparently did not share the judgmental views of her contemporaries. [[Jane Austen]] never mentioned the earlier woman by name, but several of her novels contain positive allusions to Wollstonecraft’s work.&lt;ref name="Mellor 156"&gt;Mellor 156.&lt;/ref&gt; The American literary scholar [[Anne K. Mellor]] notes several examples. In ''[[Pride and Prejudice]]'', Mr Wickham seems to be based upon the sort of man Wollstonecraft claimed that [[standing army|standing armies]] produce, while the sarcastic remarks of protagonist [[Elizabeth Bennet]] about "female accomplishments" closely echo Wollstonecraft's condemnation of these activities. The balance a woman must strike between feelings and reason in ''[[Sense and Sensibility]]'' follows what Wollstonecraft recommended in her novel ''Mary'', while the moral equivalence Austen drew in ''[[Mansfield Park]]'' between slavery and the treatment of women in British society tracks one of Wollstonecraft's favorite arguments. In ''[[Persuasion]]'', Austen's characterization of Anne Eliot (as well as her late mother before her) as better qualified than her father to manage the family estate also echoes a Wollstonecraft thesis.&lt;ref name="Mellor 156"/&gt;

Scholar Virginia Sapiro states that few read Wollstonecraft's works during the nineteenth century as "her attackers implied or stated that no self-respecting woman would read her work".&lt;ref&gt;Sapiro, 274.&lt;/ref&gt; (Still, as Craciun points out, new editions of ''Rights of Woman'' appeared in the UK in the 1840s and in the US in the 1830s, 1840s, and 1850s.&lt;ref name="Routledgeliterary"&gt;''A Routledge literary sourcebook on Mary Wollstonecraft's A vindication of the rights of woman''. Adriana Craciun, 2002, p36&lt;/ref&gt;) If readers were few, then ''many'' were inspired; one such reader was [[Elizabeth Barrett Browning]], who read ''Rights of Woman'' at age 12 and whose poem ''[[Aurora Leigh]]'' reflected Wollstonecraft's unwavering focus on education.&lt;ref&gt;Gordon, 449&lt;/ref&gt; [[Lucretia Mott]],&lt;ref&gt;Sapiro, 276–77.&lt;/ref&gt; a Quaker minister, and [[Elizabeth Cady Stanton]], Americans who met in 1840 at the [[World Anti-Slavery Convention]] in London, discovered they both had read Wollstonecraft, and they agreed upon the need for (what became) the [[Seneca Falls Convention]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Lasser &amp; Robertson|title=Antebellum Women: Private, Public, Partisan|date=2013|publisher=Rowman &amp; Littlefield|pages=46–47}}&lt;/ref&gt; an influential women's rights meeting held in 1848. Another woman who read Wollstonecraft was [[George Eliot]], a prolific writer of reviews, articles, novels, and translations. In 1855, she devoted an essay to the roles and rights of women, comparing Wollstonecraft and [[Margaret Fuller]]. Fuller was an American journalist, critic, and women's rights activist who, like Wollstonecraft, had travelled to the Continent and had been involved in the struggle for [[reform]] (in this case the [[Roman Republic (19th century)|Roman Republic]])—and she had a child by a man without marrying him.&lt;ref&gt;[[Donna Dickenson|Dickenson, Donna]].

Wollstonecraft's work was exhumed with the rise of the [[Women's suffrage in the United Kingdom|movement to give women a political voice]]. First was an attempt at rehabilitation in 1879 with the publication of Wollstonecraft's ''Letters to Imlay, with prefatory memoir'' by [[Charles Kegan Paul]].&lt;ref&gt;Wollstonecraft, Mary. ''Letters to Imlay, with prefatory memoir by C. Kegan Paul''. London: C. Kegan Paul, 1879.

With the advent of the modern [[feminist movement]], women as politically dissimilar from each other as [[Virginia Woolf]] and [[Emma Goldman]] embraced Wollstonecraft's life story.&lt;ref&gt;[[Virginia Woolf|Woolf, Virginia]].

The Richards Press, St James's Square, 1951.&lt;/ref&gt;

With the emergence of [[feminist criticism]] in academia in the 1960s and 1970s, Wollstonecraft's works returned to prominence. Their fortunes reflected that of the [[second wave feminism|second wave]] of the North American feminist movement itself; for example, in the early 1970s, six major biographies of Wollstonecraft were published that presented her "passionate life in &lt;!--not opposition--&gt;[[wikt:apposition|apposition]]&lt;!--not opposition--&gt; to [her] radical and rationalist agenda".&lt;ref&gt;Kaplan, "Wollstonecraft's reception", 254; Sapiro, 278–79.&lt;/ref&gt; The feminist artwork ''[[The Dinner Party]]'', first exhibited in 1979, features a place setting for Wollstonecraft.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.brooklynmuseum.org/eascfa/dinner_party/place_settings Place Settings].

Wollstonecraft's work has also had an effect on feminism outside the academy in recent years. [[Ayaan Hirsi Ali]], a political writer and [[List of former Muslims#Part of an unorganized religion or no religion|former Muslim]] who is [[Criticism of Islam|critical of Islam]] in general and [[Women and Islam|its dictates regarding women]] in particular, cited the ''Rights of Woman'' in her autobiography ''[[Infidel (book)|Infidel]]'' and wrote that she was "inspired by Mary Wollstonecraft, the pioneering feminist thinker who told women they had the same ability to reason as men did and deserved the same rights".&lt;ref&gt;[[Ayaan Hirsi Ali|Hirsi Ali, Ayaan]]. ''Infidel''.

[[Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences|Nobel Laureate]] [[Amartya Sen]], the Indian economist and philosopher who first identified the [[missing women of Asia]], draws repeatedly on Wollstonecraft as a political philosopher in ''[[The Idea of Justice]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b00kfgd1|title=BBC Radio 4 series ''Letters to Mary'': Episode 2|work=BBC|accessdate=21 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Major works==

===Educational works===
[[File:WollstonecraftEducation.png|thumb|right|alt=Page reads ""THOUGHTS ON THE EDUCATION OF DAUGHTERS. THE NURSERY. As I conceive it to be the duty of every rational creature to attend to its offspring, I am sorry to observe, that reason and duty together have not so powerful an influence over human"|First page of the first edition of ''[[Thoughts on the Education of Daughters]]'' (1787)]]
{{Main|Thoughts on the Education of Daughters|Original Stories from Real Life}}

The majority of Wollstonecraft's early productions are about education; she assembled an anthology of literary extracts "for the improvement of young women" entitled ''The Female Reader'' and she translated two children's works, Maria Geertruida van de Werken de Cambon's ''Young Grandison'' and [[Christian Gotthilf Salzmann]]'s ''Elements of Morality''. Her own writings also addressed the topic. In both her [[conduct book]] ''Thoughts on the Education of Daughters'' (1787) and her [[children's literature|children's book]] ''Original Stories from Real Life'' (1788), Wollstonecraft advocates educating children into the emerging middle-class ethos: self-discipline, honesty, frugality, and social contentment.&lt;ref&gt;Jones, "Literature of advice", 122–26; Kelly, 58–59.&lt;/ref&gt; Both books also emphasize the importance of teaching children to reason, revealing Wollstonecraft's intellectual debt to the important seventeenth-century educational philosopher [[John Locke]].&lt;ref&gt;Richardson, 24–27; Myers, "Impeccable Governesses", 38.&lt;/ref&gt; However, the prominence she affords religious faith and innate feeling distinguishes her work from his and links it to the discourse of [[sensibility]] popular at the end of the eighteenth century.&lt;ref&gt;Jones, "Literature of advice", 124–29; Richardson, 24–27.&lt;/ref&gt; Both texts also advocate the education of women, a controversial topic at the time and one which she would return to throughout her career, most notably in ''[[A Vindication of the Rights of Woman]]''. Wollstonecraft argues that well-educated women will be good wives and mothers and ultimately contribute positively to the nation.&lt;ref&gt;Richardson, 25–27; Jones, "Literature of advice", 124; Myers, "Impeccable Governesses", 37–39.&lt;/ref&gt;

===''Vindications''===

====''Vindication of the Rights of Men'' (1790)====
{{Main|A Vindication of the Rights of Men}}

Published in response to [[Edmund Burke]]'s ''[[Reflections on the Revolution in France]]'' (1790), which was a defence of [[constitutional monarchy]], aristocracy, and the [[Church of England]], and an attack on Wollstonecraft's friend, the Rev [[Richard Price]] at the [[Newington Green Unitarian Church]], Wollstonecraft's ''A Vindication of the Rights of Men'' (1790) attacks [[aristocracy]] and advocates [[republicanism]]. Hers was the first response in a pamphlet war that subsequently became known as the ''[[Revolution Controversy]]'', in which [[Thomas Paine]]'s ''[[Rights of Man]]'' (1792) became the rallying cry for reformers and radicals.

Wollstonecraft attacked not only monarchy and hereditary privilege but also the language that Burke used to defend and elevate it. In a famous passage in the ''Reflections'', Burke had lamented: "I had thought ten thousand swords must have leaped from their scabbards to avenge even a look that threatened her &lt;nowiki&gt;[&lt;/nowiki&gt;[[Marie Antoinette]]&lt;nowiki&gt;]&lt;/nowiki&gt; with insult.—But the age of chivalry is gone."&lt;ref&gt;Qtd. in Butler, 44.&lt;/ref&gt; Most of Burke's detractors deplored what they viewed as theatrical pity for the French queen—a pity they felt was at the expense of the people. Wollstonecraft was unique in her attack on Burke's gendered language. By redefining the [[sublime (philosophy)|sublime]] and the beautiful, terms first established by Burke himself in ''[[A Philosophical Enquiry into the Origin of Our Ideas of the Sublime and Beautiful]]'' (1756), she undermined his rhetoric as well as his argument. Burke had associated the beautiful with weakness and femininity and the sublime with strength and masculinity; Wollstonecraft turns these definitions against him, arguing that his theatrical ''tableaux'' turn Burke's readers—the citizens—into weak women who are swayed by show.&lt;ref&gt;Wollstonecraft, ''Vindications'', 45; Johnson, 26; Sapiro, 121–22; Kelly, 90; 97–98.&lt;/ref&gt; In her first unabashedly feminist critique, which Wollstonecraft scholar [[Claudia L. Johnson (scholar)|Claudia L. Johnson]] argues remains unsurpassed in its argumentative force,&lt;ref&gt;Johnson, 27; see also, Todd, 165.&lt;/ref&gt; Wollstonecraft indicts Burke's defence of an unequal society founded on the passivity of women.

In her arguments for republican virtue, Wollstonecraft invokes an emerging middle-class ethos in opposition to what she views as the vice-ridden aristocratic code of manners.&lt;ref&gt;Sapiro, 83; Kelly, 94–95; Todd, 164.&lt;/ref&gt; Influenced by [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]] thinkers, she believed in progress and derides Burke for relying on tradition and custom. She argues for rationality, pointing out that Burke's system would lead to the continuation of [[slavery]], simply because it had been an ancestral tradition.&lt;ref&gt;Wollstonecraft, ''Vindications'', 44.&lt;/ref&gt; She describes an idyllic country life in which each family can have a farm that will just suit its needs. Wollstonecraft contrasts her [[utopia]]n picture of society, drawn with what she says is genuine feeling, to Burke's false feeling.&lt;ref&gt;Jones, "Political tradition", 44–46; Sapiro, 216.&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''Rights of Men'' was Wollstonecraft's first overtly political work, as well as her first feminist work; as Johnson contends, "it seems that in the act of writing the later portions of ''Rights of Men'' she discovered the subject that would preoccupy her for the rest of her career."&lt;ref&gt;Johnson, 29.&lt;/ref&gt; It was this text that made her a well-known writer.

====''Vindication of the Rights of Woman'' (1792)====
{{Main|A Vindication of the Rights of Woman}}

''A Vindication of the Rights of Woman'' is one of the earliest works of feminist philosophy. In it, Wollstonecraft argues that women ought to have an education [[wikt:commensurate|commensurate]] with their position in society and then proceeds to redefine that position, claiming that women are essential to the nation because they educate its children and because they could be "companions" to their husbands rather than mere wives.&lt;ref&gt;Wollstonecraft, ''Vindications'', 192.&lt;/ref&gt; Instead of viewing women as ornaments to society or property to be traded in marriage, Wollstonecraft maintains that they are human beings deserving of the same fundamental rights as men. Large sections of the ''Rights of Woman'' respond vitriolically to [[conduct book]] writers such as [[James Fordyce]] and [[John Gregory (moralist)|John Gregory]] and educational philosophers such as [[Jean-Jacques Rousseau]], who wanted to deny women an education. (Rousseau famously argues in ''[[Emile: Or, On Education|Émile]]'' (1762) that women should be educated for the pleasure of men.)&lt;ref&gt;Kelly, 123; 126; Taylor, 14–15; Sapiro, 27–28; 13–31; 243–44.&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Vindication1b.jpg|thumb|left|alt=Title page reads "A VINDICATION OF THE RIGHTS OF WOMAN: WITH STRICUTRES ON POLITICAL AND MORAL SUBJECTS. BY MARY WOLLSTONECRAFT. PRINTED AT BOSTON, BY PETER EDES FOR THOMAS AND ANDREWS, Faust's Statue, No. 45, Newbury-Street, MDCCXCII."|Title page from the first American edition of ''[[A Vindication of the Rights of Woman]]'' (1792)]]
Wollstonecraft states that currently many women are silly and superficial (she refers to them, for example, as "spaniels" and "toys"&lt;ref&gt;Wollstonecraft, ''Vindications'', 144.&lt;/ref&gt;), but argues that this is not because of an innate deficiency of mind but rather because men have denied them access to education. Wollstonecraft is intent on illustrating the limitations that women's deficient educations have placed on them; she writes: "Taught from their infancy that beauty is woman's sceptre, the mind shapes itself to the body, and, roaming round its gilt cage, only seeks to adorn its prison."&lt;ref&gt;Wollstonecraft, ''Vindications'', 157.&lt;/ref&gt; She implies that, without the encouragement young women receive from an early age to focus their attention on beauty and outward accomplishments, women could achieve much more.&lt;ref&gt;Kelly, 124–26; Taylor, 14–15.&lt;/ref&gt;

While Wollstonecraft does call for equality between the sexes in particular areas of life, such as morality, she does not explicitly state that men and women are equal.&lt;ref&gt;See, for example Wollstonecraft, ''Vindications'', 126, 146.&lt;/ref&gt; What she does claim is that men and women are equal in the eyes of God. However, such claims of equality stand in contrast to her statements respecting the superiority of masculine strength and valour.&lt;ref&gt;Wollstonecraft, ''Vindications'', 110.&lt;/ref&gt; Wollstonecraft famously and ambiguously writes: "Let it not be concluded that I wish to invert the order of things; I have already granted, that, from the constitution of their bodies, men seem to be designed by Providence to attain a greater degree of virtue. I speak collectively of the whole sex; but I see not the shadow of a reason to conclude that their virtues should differ in respect to their nature. In fact, how can they, if virtue has only one eternal standard? I must therefore, if I reason consequently, as strenuously maintain that they have the same simple direction, as that there is a God."&lt;ref&gt;Wollstonecraft, ''Vindications'', 135.&lt;/ref&gt; Her ambiguous statements regarding the equality of the sexes have since made it difficult to classify Wollstonecraft as a modern feminist, particularly since the word and the concept were unavailable to her.&lt;ref&gt;The words ''feminist'' and ''feminism'' did not come into existence until the 1890s. ''Oxford English Dictionary''. Retrieved 17 September 2007; see Taylor, 12; 55–57; 105–06; 118–20; Sapiro, 257–59.&lt;/ref&gt;

One of Wollstonecraft's most scathing critiques in the ''Rights of Woman'' is of false and excessive [[sensibility]], particularly in women. She argues that women who succumb to sensibility are "blown about by every momentary gust of feeling" and because they are "the prey of their senses" they cannot think rationally.&lt;ref&gt;Wollstonecraft, ''Vindications'', 177.&lt;/ref&gt; In fact, she claims, they do harm not only to themselves but to the entire civilization: these are not women who can help refine a civilization—a popular eighteenth-century idea—but women who will destroy it. Wollstonecraft does not argue that reason and feeling should act independently of each other; rather, she believes that they should inform each other.&lt;ref&gt;Jones, 46.&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to her larger philosophical arguments, Wollstonecraft also lays out a specific educational plan. In the twelfth chapter of the ''Rights of Woman'', "On National Education", she argues that all children should be sent to a "country day school" as well as given some education at home "to inspire a love of home and domestic pleasures." She also maintains that schooling should be [[coeducation|co-educational]], arguing that men and women, whose marriages are "the cement of society", should be "educated after the same model."&lt;ref&gt;Wollstonecraft, ''Vindications'', Chapter 12; see also Kelly, 124–25; 133–34; Sapiro, 237ff.&lt;/ref&gt;

Wollstonecraft addresses her text to the middle-class, which she describes as the "most natural state", and in many ways the ''Rights of Woman'' is inflected by a [[bourgeoisie|bourgeois]] view of the world.&lt;ref&gt;Kelly, 128ff; Taylor, 167–68; Sapiro, 27.&lt;/ref&gt; It encourages [[modesty]] and industry in its readers and attacks the uselessness of the aristocracy. But Wollstonecraft is not necessarily a friend to the poor; for example, in her national plan for education, she suggests that, after the age of nine, the poor, except for those who are brilliant, should be separated from the rich and taught in another school.&lt;ref&gt;Wollstonecraft, ''Vindications'', 311; see also Taylor, 159–61; Sapiro, 91–92.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Novels===
[[File:Otto Scholderer Lesendes Mädchen.jpg|thumb|right|alt=Portrait of a girl reading a book with her shoulder and back exposed painted in a brown palette.|[[Otto Scholderer]]'s ''Young Girl Reading'' (1883); in both ''Mary'' and ''The Wrongs of Woman'', Wollstonecraft criticizes women who imagine themselves as sentimental heroines.]]
{{Main|Mary: A Fiction|Maria: or, The Wrongs of Woman}}

Both of Wollstonecraft's novels criticize what she viewed as the [[wikt:patriarchal|patriarchal]] institution of marriage and its deleterious effects on women. In her first novel, ''Mary: A Fiction'' (1788), the eponymous heroine is forced into a loveless marriage for economic reasons; she fulfils her desire for love and affection outside of marriage with two passionate [[romantic friendship]]s, one with a woman and one with a man. ''Maria: or, The Wrongs of Woman'' (1798), an unfinished novel published posthumously and often considered Wollstonecraft's most radical feminist work,&lt;ref&gt;Taylor, Chapter 9.&lt;/ref&gt; revolves around the story of a woman imprisoned in an insane asylum by her husband; like Mary, Maria also finds fulfilment outside of marriage, in an affair with a fellow inmate and a friendship with one of her keepers. Neither of Wollstonecraft's novels depict successful marriages, although she posits such relationships in the ''Rights of Woman''. At the end of ''Mary'', the heroine believes she is going "to that world where there is neither marrying, nor giving in marriage",&lt;ref&gt;Wollstonecraft, ''Mary'', 68.&lt;/ref&gt; presumably a positive state of affairs.&lt;ref&gt;Poovey, 100–01; Taylor, 232–33.&lt;/ref&gt;

Both of Wollstonecraft's novels also critique the discourse of [[sensibility]], a moral philosophy and aesthetic that had become popular at the end of the eighteenth century. ''Mary'' is itself a novel of sensibility and Wollstonecraft attempts to use the tropes of that genre to undermine sentimentalism itself, a philosophy she believed was damaging to women because it encouraged them to rely overmuch on their emotions. In ''The Wrongs of Woman'' the heroine's indulgence on romantic fantasies fostered by novels themselves is depicted as particularly detrimental.&lt;ref&gt;Johnson, 60; 65–66; Kelly, 44; Poovey, 89; Taylor, 135; Todd, ''Women's Friendship'', 210–11.&lt;/ref&gt;

Female friendships are central to both of Wollstonecraft's novels, but it is the friendship between Maria and Jemima, the servant charged with watching over her in the insane asylum, that is the most historically significant. This friendship, based on a sympathetic bond of motherhood, between an upper-class woman and a lower-class woman is one of the first moments in the history of feminist literature that hints at a cross-class argument, that is, that women of different economic positions have the same interests because they are women.&lt;ref&gt;Todd, ''Women's Friendship'', 208, 221–22; Johnson, 67–68; Taylor, 233; 243–44; Sapiro, 155.&lt;/ref&gt;

===''Letters Written in Sweden, Norway, and Denmark'' (1796)===
{{Main|Letters Written in Sweden, Norway, and Denmark}}

Wollstonecraft's ''Letters Written in Sweden, Norway, and Denmark'' is a deeply personal [[travel literature|travel narrative]]. The twenty-five letters cover a wide range of topics, from sociological reflections on Scandinavia and its peoples to philosophical questions regarding identity to musings on her relationship with [[Gilbert Imlay|Imlay]] (although he is not referred to by name in the text). Using the rhetoric of the [[sublime (philosophy)|sublime]], Wollstonecraft explores the relationship between the self and society. Reflecting the strong influence of [[Jean-Jacques Rousseau|Rousseau]], ''Letters Written in Sweden, Norway, and Denmark'' shares the themes of the French philosopher's ''[[Reveries of a Solitary Walker]]'' (1782): "the search for the source of human happiness, the stoic rejection of material goods, the ecstatic embrace of nature, and the essential role of sentiment in understanding".&lt;ref&gt;Favret, 104; Sapiro, 286–87.&lt;/ref&gt; While Rousseau ultimately rejects society, however, Wollstonecraft celebrates domestic scenes and industrial progress in her text.&lt;ref&gt;Favret, 105–06.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:The Icebergs (Frederic Edwin Church), 1861 (color).jpg|thumb|left|alt=Painting of icebergs, with one white iceberg dominating the center of the work and dark blue and black icebergs framing the piece. The work is painted in a suggestive style rather than with precise detail.|''[[The Icebergs]]'' (1861) by [[Frederic Edwin Church]] demonstrates the aesthetic of the [[sublime (philosophy)|sublime]].]]
Wollstonecraft promotes subjective experience, particularly in relation to nature, exploring the connections between the sublime and [[sensibility]]. Many of the letters describe the breathtaking scenery of Scandinavia and Wollstonecraft's desire to create an emotional connection to that natural world. In so doing, she gives greater value to the imagination than she had in previous works.&lt;ref&gt;Myers, "Wollstonecraft's ''Letters''", 167; 180; Poovey, 83–84; 106; Kelly, 189–90.&lt;/ref&gt; As in her previous writings, she champions the liberation and education of women.&lt;ref&gt;Myers, "Wollstonecraft's ''Letters''", 174; Favret, 96; 120; 127.&lt;/ref&gt; In a change from her earlier works, however, she illustrates the detrimental effects of commerce on society, contrasting the imaginative connection to the world with a commercial and mercenary one, an attitude she associates with Imlay.&lt;ref&gt;Favret, 119ff; Poovey, 93; Myers, "Wollstonecraft's ''Letters''", 177; Kelly, 179–181.&lt;/ref&gt;

''Letters Written in Sweden, Norway, and Denmark'' was Wollstonecraft's most popular book in the 1790s. It sold well and was reviewed positively by most critics. [[William Godwin|Godwin]] wrote "if ever there was a book calculated to make a man in love with its author, this appears to me to be the book."&lt;ref name=Godwin95&gt;Godwin, 95.&lt;/ref&gt; It influenced [[Romanticism|Romantic]] poets such as [[William Wordsworth]] and [[Samuel Taylor Coleridge]], who drew on its themes and its aesthetic.&lt;ref&gt;Todd, 367; Kaplan, "Mary Wollstonecraft's reception", 262; Sapiro, 35; Favret, 128.&lt;/ref&gt;

It is one of the [[regional accreditation|seven]] regional [[school accreditation|accreditation]] organizations dating back 125 years and is recognized by the [[United States Department of Education]] and the [[Council for Higher Education Accreditation]].

Its headquarters are in [[Center City, Philadelphia]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.msche.org/ Home page]. Middle States Association of Colleges and Schools. Retrieved on May 12, 2015. "200 Market Street Philadelphia, PA 19104"&lt;/ref&gt;

==Region and scope==

==History==
MSCHE grew out of the [[Middle States Association of Colleges and Schools]] (MSA), an organization established in 1887 to improve education using evaluation and accreditation. MSCHE itself was established in 1919 and was one of three Commissions of MSA until 2013 when MSCHE incorporated as a separate entity in Pennsylvania as the Mid-Atlantic Region Commission on Higher Education doing business as the Middle States Commission on Higher Education.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.msche.org/?Nav1=ABOUT&amp;Nav2=FAQ&amp;Nav3=QUESTION04 |title=Frequently Asked Questions About the Middle States Association and the Middle States Commission on Higher Education |publisher=Middle States Commission on Higher Education |date=2015 |accessdate=December 18, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== History ===
[[Image:湛若水.jpg|thumb|150px|南雍祭酒 湛若水 ([[Zhan Ruoshui]], former 'president')]]

Nanjing, situated in the lower part of the [[Yangtze]], has historically been the capital of various kingdoms and dynasties, with the reputation as the center of education. In 258 CE, the [[Eastern Wu|Kingdom of Wu]] under the reign of [[Sun Xiu|Emperor Jing of Wu]], founded a [[Confucian]] learning institute for the purpose of learning [[Six Arts]]. In the first year of Jianwu reign (317), Taihsueh (太學) campus was built in today's [[Fuzimiao]] ({{lang|zh-hans|夫子廟}}) area on the banks of [[Qinhuai River]], and Nanking Imperial University began recruiting students from common families instead of only from noble families.&lt;ref&gt;Nanking Taihsueh campus was initially located in north of Qinhuai River, twenty years later the campus in south of Qinhuai was constructed, and thus the school was on both banks of the river.&lt;/ref&gt; Like its forerunner Chengjun ({{lang|zh-hans|成均}}) and succeeding [[Shang Xiang|Shang Hsiang]] ({{lang|zh-hans|上庠}}) founded by [[Yu the Great|Yu]] ({{lang|zh-hans|禹}}, 21st century BCE) in Chungyuan, the earliest recorded imperial higher learning institutions and their successors, it was the Kingdom's central university, which after [[Han dynasty]] excellent students from local schools could be selected to attend to pursue further education.

In 470 during the [[Former Song dynasty]], the Imperial Central University (Zongmingguan) became a comprehensive institution combining higher education and research, with five divisions: Literature, History, [[Confucianism|Confucian Study]], [[Xuan Study]] and [[School of Naturalists|Yin Yang Study]]. The campus of School of Literature and School of History were located in today's Nanjing University Gulou campus, west to [[Drum Tower of Nanjing|Gulou]] ({{lang|zh-hans|鼓樓}}) mountain, and the campus was moved to today's [[Chaotian Palace]] ({{lang|zh-hans|朝天宮}}) area at the time when [[Wang Jian (Southern Qi)|Wang Jian]] ({{lang|zh-hans|王儉}}) was university president and the areas of study were narrowed, with a heavy focus on [[Confucian classics]]. In the period the faculty members included such scholars and scientists as [[Zu Chongzhi]] ({{lang|zh-hans|祖沖之}}), [[Ge Hong]] ({{lang|zh-hans|葛洪}}), [[Wang Xizhi]] ({{lang|zh-hans|王羲之}}), and students included such figures as Xiao Daocheng, [[Emperor Gao of Southern Qi]] who studied at School of Confucian Studies, and [[Zhong Rong]], a founding scholar of poetics who graduated from division of literature. After the fall of [[Chen dynasty]], the school was closed and later replaced by Nanking Academy (or Jiangzhou Academy, Jiangzhou Zhouxue) in [[Sui dynasty]].

In 937 when campus of the imperial national university was again in Fuzimiao area, [[Li Shandao]], a scholar of the university, established another national school [[Mount Lu|Lushan]] National Academy outside the capital city Nanking which is called [[Bailudong Shuyuan]] ([[White Deer Grotto Academy]]), a famous academy that hosted many renowned scholars including [[Zhu Xi]], [[Lu Jiuyuan]] and [[Wang Yangming]].

In 1382 the Imperial University ({{lang|zh-hans|國子監}} [[Kuotzuchien]] or [[Guozijian]]) moved campus from Nanking Fuzimiao area to south of Qintian Mountain ({{lang|zh-hans|欽天山}}) and [[Xuanwu Lake]] (the area around Nanjing University campus before 1952. In 1952 Nanjing University moved to Gulou and its engineering school was split and formed several independent colleges including [[Nanjing Institute of Technology]], which at its peak spanning 10 Li and hosting near 10,000 students, and around there were institutes including Qintian Jian (Imperial Astronomy Institute) and Taiyi Yuan (Imperial Medical Institute). In 1403 Peking Guozijian ([[Beijing Guozijian]], Imperial University of Peking) was established. The Imperial University of Nanking ({{lang|zh-hans|南京國子監}}) developed and flourished in the period, consisting of six schools: three basic level colleges (Chengyi, ChongChih, Guangye), two middle level schools (Hsiudao, Chenghsin) and one advanced level school (Shuaihsing), altogether 4 years to complete according to the system, one and a half years for both of the former two levels and one year for the latter level, to achieve 8 credit points a year and then upon graduation Chushen (qualification, diploma) would be awarded, with subjects including [[Confucian classics]], history, literature, mathematics, law, calligraphy, equestrianism and archery, etc.&lt;ref&gt;According to the system, it takes 4 years to complete the three stage study. However, actually many took more years to complete, and some even spent more than ten years, partly due to the substantial subsidies provided to the university including to its students by government, but later with the scale expanding the subsidies were often delayed, as indicated in the Report of Nanking Imperial University by the president Chao Yonghsian (趙用賢：《南京太學條陳疏》).&lt;/ref&gt; [[Yongle Encyclopedia]] was completed at Imperial Nanking University in 1408 after five years compilation, 9169 scholars selected from nationwide took part in it, thereinto 2180 were student scholars of the university. The publishing house of the imperial university of Nanking had been a publishing centre for several hundred years. [[Wu Cheng'en]], [[Tang Xianzu|Tang Hsiantzu]] and [[Zheng Chenggong]] studied there during the [[Ming dynasty]].

Each time when Nanking became a non-capital city, the Nanking Imperial University was changed to be regional Nanking Academy. The Imperial Nanking University was changed to Nanking Academy ({{lang|zh-hans|江寧府學}}, [[Nanjing|Jiangning]] Fuxue) in 1650 after [[Qing dynasty]] replaced [[Ming dynasty]], and in 1865 after Taiping Rebellion the academy was relocated to Chaotian Palace. The ancient school history was recognized during ROC. In 1954 the school authority controlled by CPC decided to set the year starting to establish the modern new type school Sanjiang Normal College as the school's new founding year.&lt;ref group="Note" name=historyrecognition&gt;The university since controlled by Conmmuist Party of China (CPC) which established People's Republic of China (PRC) has not officially recognized the ancient history of the university, however, since reform era in many occasions it recognizes, for instance, Nanyong, one of the school names used in Ming dynasty which was also used by the school after the dynasty, is still often used, e.g., Nanjing University history record is often called Nanyong history record, the series of selected academic works in humanity by Nanjing University scholars in Republic of China (ROC) era republished by Nanjing University Publishing House is called Nanyong Academic Classics, the concert performed by Nanjing University [[Guqin]] Society is called Nanyong Qin Concert.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Late Qing and Republic of China ===
[[File:道貫古今.gif|thumb|left|[[Paifang]] of "[[Tao]] is Universal Through All Times" ({{lang|zh-hans|道貫古今}}), at the former campus site [[Chaotian Palace]]]]

In 1902, Sanjiang Normal College ({{lang|zh-hans|三江師範學堂}}) under the new educational system, using Japanese modern higher institutions of learning as references, was beginning to be established to replace the traditional Chinese school Nanking Academy, and was opened in the next year, with campus constructed south to Qintian Mountain. The name was changed to Liangjiang Normal College ({{lang|zh-hans|兩江師範學堂}}) in 1906, and the new president [[Li Ruiqing]] ({{lang|zh-hans|李瑞清}}) established the first faculty of modern art in China.

In 1915 after the [[Republic of China (1912–49)|Republic of China]] replaced Qing dynasty, the Nanking Higher Normal School ({{lang|zh-hans|南京高等師範學校}}) was founded to replace Liangjiang Higher Normal School which was closed three years before due to [[Xinhai Revolution]], [[Jiang Qian]] ({{lang|zh-hans|江謙}}) was appointed as the president.&lt;ref&gt;Jiang Qian was appointed as the president of Nanking Higher Normal School in July 1914, to establish the school in the campus of the closed Liangjiang Higher Normal School, and the charger of keeping of Liangjiang Higher Normal School became a member of the preparatory committee of Nanking Higher Normal School. Nanking Higher Normal School opened in September 1915.&lt;/ref&gt; The school established the China's first faculty of modern gymnastics ([[physical education]]) in 1916. In 1920 the school consisted of five colleges: Liberal Arts, Agriculture, Engineering, Commerce and Education.

The "[[China Science Society]]" ({{lang|zh-hans|中國科學社}}), a major science organization in the modern history of China, founded its headquarter in the school in 1918. Its members established "[[Academia Sinica]]" ({{lang|zh-hans|中央研究院}}) which was later moved to Taiwan and known as the "[[Chinese Academy of Sciences]]" ({{lang|zh-hans|中國科學院}}) in mainland China. Numerous Chinese modern science pioneers, most of whom studied in America and some European countries such as Britain, France, and Germany, converged there to found many fields of science in China. It became the Chinese cradle of modern science. Among 81 academicians of "[[Academia Sinica]]" elected for the first time in 1948, five entered or graduated from the university in 1920. More than half of the leading Chinese scientists whose works were published in scientific journals in the early period of Chinese modern science were graduates or academics of Nanjing University.

[[Kuo Ping-wen]] (Guo Bingwen, {{lang|zh-hans|郭秉文}}), an influential university president, was appointed in 1919 after Jiang Qian. The school meeting passed ''The Audit Law for Women Students'' ({{lang|zh-hans|《規定女子旁聽法案》}}) on December 7, 1919, as result of efforts of the educationist [[T'ao Hsing-chih]] (Tao Xingzhi, {{lang|zh-hans|陶行知}}), as well as the president Guo Bingwen, and the professors including [[Liu Boming (philosopher)|Liu Boming]] ({{lang|zh-hans|劉伯明}}), [[Luh Chih-wei]] (Lu Zhiwei, {{lang|zh-hans|陸志偉}}), [[Yang Hsingfo]] (Yang Xingfo, {{lang|zh-hans|楊杏佛}}), etc., and then decided to formally recruit female students. The school became the first higher learning institution in China to recruit [[coeducation]]al students. It enrolled eight women students in the first year 1920, and in addition, more than 50 female auditing students were admitted.

In 1921 the National Southeastern University ({{lang|zh-hans|國立東南大學}}) was founded, and in 1923 Nanking Higher Normal School was merged into it. In the autumn of 1921, the Faculty of Business established in 1917 was moved to [[Shanghai]] to establish the first [[business school]] conferring degrees in China. The university consisted of five colleges (or schools) at the time: Liberal Arts (including departments of Chinese literature, foreign literature, history, philosophy, psychology，mathematics, physics, chemistry, biology, geoscience, and the Department of Politics, Law and Economics), Education, Agriculture, Engineering, and Commerce (or Business, including  departments of general commerce, business administration, accounting, finance, economics, international trade, etc.), and soon later the College of Liberal Arts was divided to be College of Humanities and College of Sciences. The earliest modern scientific research laboratories and groups in China were established at the university. It integrated teaching and research, with status of university's independence and academic freedom, and was regarded as the earliest Chinese modern university. The university along with its affiliated primary school and middle school served as a pioneer and model which laid the foundations for the establishment of modern educational system ({{lang|zh-hans|壬戌學制}}, Renhsü Hsüehchih, 1922) in China, and in addition, its experimental kindergarten (Gulou Kindergarten) founded in 1923 was later also adopted as the model for Chinese kindergartens (Kindergarten Courses Standards by Ministration of Education, 1932), including its teaching system, teaching materials, teaching methods and teaching tools. In October 1921, "Hsuehheng Society" (or Xueheng Society, {{lang|zh-hans|學衡社}}) was founded in the university which was the focus of the "Hsuehheng School" included the scholars [[Liu Yizheng]] ({{lang|zh-hans|柳詒徵}}), [[Liu Boming (philosopher)|Liu Boming]] (劉伯明), [[Mei Guangdi]] ({{lang|zh-hans|梅光迪}}), [[Wu Mi]] ({{lang|zh-hans|吳宓}}) and [[Hu Hsien-Hsu]] (Hu Xiansu, {{lang|zh-hans|胡先驌}}). They reinvigorated [[Confucianism|Confucian culture]] and [[humanism]] and published the monthly "Critical Review" (Xueheng, {{lang|zh-hans|學衡}} in Chinese) in January 1922. It enabled Nanjing University to become a center of Confucian thought and humanistic scholarship. During this period, Nanjing University was known as the foremost "Oriental Education Centre" and recognized as an academic and cultural exchange centre for east and west. Many scholars visited and instructed there, including the American educationist [[Paul Monroe]], [[W. H. Kilpatrick]], [[E. L. Thorndike]], philosopher [[John Dewey]], British philosopher [[Bertrand Russell]], German philosopher [[Hans Driesch]] and the [[India]]n (also [[Bengal]]i) poet [[Rabindranath Tagore]].

The university became the capital national university after Nanking was made the capital by [[Nationalist Government]], initially renamed National Dyisyi Chungshan University (or called National Nanking Chungshan University) in June 1927 when National Southeastern University merged eight public schools in Jiangsu province, and was renamed Jiangsu University in February 1928, and in May 1928, it was renamed National Central University ({{lang|zh-hans|國立中央大學}}).&lt;ref&gt;The university was called the capital national university after Nanking was made the capital city again in 1927, and in the June National Southeastern University merged eight public schools in Jiangsu province: the national [[Hohai Technology University]] and [[Shanghai University of Finance and Economics|Shanghai Commerce University]] and the provincial Jiangsu Law and Politics University, Jiangsu Medical University, Nanking Agricultural School, Nanking Technical Specialized School, Soochow Technical Specialized School and Shanghai Commercial Specialized School, and was renamed National Dyisyi Chungshan University (Disi Zhongshan University, the Fourth Chungshan University or the Fourth Zhongshan University. Dyisyi or Disi, meaning the fourth, indicates that the city was the fourth major city captured by the Northern Expeditionary Army and with a national university under Nationalist Government. Chungshan of the time, or Zhongshan as the spelling now in mainland China, is another name of [[Sun Yat-sen]].) which was also called National Nanking Chungshan University (or Nanjing Zhongshan University) due to its location. The students movement against the renaming broke out after it was renamed Jiangsu University by the government in February 1928, and the students requested that the school be renamed National Nanking University. Then there emerged the proposal (by [[Woo Chih-hui]], who was soon later selected as the university president and did not take up the post and was appointed the first president of [[Academia Sinica]]) to rename National Capital University and the proposal (by Ma Yinbing, who was at the time responsible for Nanking municipal construction) to rename National Central University which gained wide support and was accepted by the university students. And in May 1928, the school was renamed National Central University (National Chungyang University or Zhongyang University, Kuoli Chungyang Tahsueh, 國立中央大學).&lt;/ref&gt; At the time there were eight colleges (or schools): Humanity, Social Science, Natural Science, Engineering, Education, Commerce, Agriculture, and Medicine. The College of Commerce moved to Shanghai in 1921 and College of Medicine established in Shanghai in 1927 were split from the university in 1932.&lt;ref&gt;The university's commerce college became [[National Shanghai Commerce College]] and then [[Shanghai University of Finance and Economics]], and medical college became [[National Shanghai Medical College]] and then [[Shanghai Medical University]] which later merged with [[Fudan University]].&lt;/ref&gt; In 1935 College of Medicine was again established, in Nanjing. During the [[Anti-Japanese War]] between 1937 and 1945, the university moved to [[Chongqing]], while the College of Medicine and Department of Animal Husbandry &amp; Veterinary Medicine of College of Agriculture moved to [[Chengdu]]. The Chinese Association of Natural Science ({{lang|zh-hans|中華自然科學社}}) was originated at the university in 1927 and adopted the name next year, which was the second largest scientific organization in China in 1949, after China Science Society. China Association of Scientific Workers ({{lang|zh-hans|中國科學工作者協會}}) was founded in the university in 1944.&lt;ref&gt;China Association of Scientific Workers was initiated by China Science Society along with Chinese Association of Natural Science and other specialized associations including Chinese Agricultural Association and China Engineering Society in 1944 in the Republic of China. China Association of Scientific Workers, together with corresponding associations of other states including [[British Association of Scientific Workers]], founded [[World Federation of Scientific Workers]] in [[London]] in 1946 after World War II.&lt;/ref&gt; China Science Society and the associations were merged to be the [[China Association for Science and Technology]] ({{lang|zh-hans|中國科學技術協會}}) in 1958 in [[Beijing]]. The Natural Science Forum was initiated by the university faculties in 1939, which was later renamed Jiusan Forum (Sept. 3rd Forum) and became [[Jiusan Society]] in 1945, an organization for intellectual groups in China.  In the united college entrance examinations beginning in 1937, about two-thirds of students put the university as the first choice. It became the first Chinese university enrolling blind college student, when enrolled Luo Fuxin ({{lang|zh-hans|羅福鑫}}) in 1942.

=== People's Republic of China ===
In 1949, during the late time of [[Chinese Civil War]], the central government of the [[Republic of China (1912–1949)|Republic of China]] retreated from [[Nanking]] and the National Central University was renamed National Nanking University (National Nanjing University, {{lang|zh-hans|國立南京大學}}) after Nanking was controlled by CPC army, before the establishment of [[People's Republic of China]]. In 1952, many colleges and departments, mainly colleges of education (or teacher, normal, including art and physical education departments), engineering, agriculture, and medicine, were split from Nanjing University, and many new independent schools were formed, including [[Nanjing Normal University]], [[Nanjing Institute of Technology]] which was located at former Nanjing University site and later renamed [[Southeast University]], etc.&lt;ref&gt;The split schools and departments of Nanjing University formed independent schools in 1952 include today's [[Nanjing Normal University]], [[Southeast University]], [[Hohai University]], [[Nanjing Agricultural University]], [[Nanjing Forestry University]], etc., and the schools share the source and were independently established after that time include the [[Fourth Military Medical University]], [[Nanjing University of Information Science and Technology]], [[Nanjing University of Technology]], [[Jiangsu University]], [[Jiangnan University]], [[Changzhou University]], etc..&lt;/ref&gt; At the same time, [[University of Nanking]] ({{lang|zh-hans|金陵大學}}), a private university established in 1888 and sponsored by American churches, was merged into Nanjing University ({{lang|zh-hans|南京大學}}), which lost its "national" appellation in 1950 to reflect the reality that all universities in the PRC would be public, and  Nanjing University moved campus to the site of University of Nanking where was west to Gulou Mountain and was also once the site of imperial Nanjing University in ancient times. A separate [[National Central University]] was reinstated in [[Taiwan]] by its old alumni association in 1962.

During the period of communist society including the period of [[Cultural Revolution|Proletarian Cultural Revolution]], the school suffered heavily. In 1976, Nanjing University faculty members and students launched Anti [[Cultural Revolution]] Force Movement which was called "[[Nanjing Incident (Cultural Revolution Period)|Nanjing Incident]]" by the authorities of the time, spreading countrywide. In 1978, Hu Fuming, a faculty member of Nanjing University in philosophy, wrote the historic article entitled "Practice is the Sole Criterion for Testing Truth", and after being published it led to the nationwide "[[Debate on Standards for Judging the Truth]]", and thus in certain degree liberated thought and promoted the ending of Cultural Revolution and the coming of reform era.

=== After the Reform and new development ===
Many faculties have been reestablished or newly founded since the Reform after 1978, e.g., law reestablished in 1981, medical school in 1987, environmental department newly founded in 1984. Some departments were divided into two or more departments, e.g., the Chinese language and literature department divided into departments of language &amp; linguistics, literature, philology and drama arts, or some new faculties came out of older faculties, e.g., computer came out of mathematics, urban planning came out of geography, in many case formed integratively, i.e., formed based on parts of two or more faculties, e.g., parts of faculties of physics and chemistry integratively formed material faculty. In around 1990 the university consisted of schools (colleges) of Humanities, Sciences, Technological Sciences, Medicine, Business, etc.. Then many departments became schools, e.g., mathematics, physics, chemistry, or grouped into new schools, e.g., architecture and urban planning. The size of university significantly expanded during the years.

In 2009, Xianlin Campus was opened, replacing Pukou Campus which was put into use in 1993, and Pukou Campus became the campus of Jinling College which was founded by Nanda. The Xianlin campus is a main campus along with Gulou campus.

== Faculties ==
[[Image:Nju.auditoria.jpg|thumb|Old Great Hall ({{lang|zh-hans|大禮堂}})]]

More than 1500 years ago, ancient University of Nanjing founded the earliest faculties of literature, history, etc.. In modern times, Nanjing University established Chinese first faculties of art, gymnastics, biology, psychology, business management, etc.. Its faculties, departments and schools have been changed and evolved timely. For example, in 1921, the university consisted of 5 schools: liberal arts, education, agriculture, engineering and business, in 1928 the school of liberal arts had become three schools, and the university consisted of 8 schools: humanities, social sciences, natural sciences, education, agriculture, engineering, business and medicine, and now, many former departments of humanities, natural sciences and social sciences have become schools.

The system of academic degree or diploma has also been changed. In the early years of ROC the university adopted the system similar to western especially American universities and began to award bachelor's degree. The university founded China's first modern laboratories in physics, chemistry, etc.. In 1922, the university professors founded The Biology Research Institute of Science Society of China, the first modern scientific research institute in China, integrated with the university's biology department. With the aid of Rockefeller Foundation, Science Centre was constructed in 1924 and completed three years later. In 1926 the university passed The General Regulation of Graduate Institute. China's first doctor's degree was awarded by the school of medicine of the university in 1931. Soon the educational system was changed. In the early 1980s after a period of transformation, universities in mainland China resumed to award doctor's degrees, and graduate and undergraduate education were integrated into departments and schools. Nanjing University is the first in mainland China to award doctor's degrees in such fields as Chinese studies, world history, computer science.

It is distinguished in many fields including Chinese Language and Literature,&lt;ref name="sohu.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://learning.sohu.com/20070414/n249432884.shtml |script-title=zh:南京大学：中文系的排名和北大并列第一-搜狐教育|website=learning.sohu.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://edu.people.com.cn/n1/2016/0613/c9320-28430359.html |script-title=zh:2016中国721所大学各学科排行榜--教育--人民网|first=|last=2628|website=edu.people.com.cn}}&lt;/ref&gt; and natural sciences.&lt;ref name="natureindex.com"/&gt;

== Campus ==
[[File:Nanjing University, Gulou Campus.jpg|thumb|The Gulou campus in autumn]]
[[File:Nanjing Univeristy Xianlin Campus Library 2.jpg|thumb|Duxia Library in Nanjing University, Xianlin Campus, built in 2007]]

Nanjing University has three main campuses: Gulou, Xianlin and Pukou campus. The distance between Gulou and Xianlin campus is about 18 kilometers.

Gulou Campus is located in Gulou District, at the center of [[Nanjing City]]. The main campus itself is divided into two sections by Hankou Road: North Garden, Bei Yuan, is where teaching and research take place; and South Garden, Nan Yuan, serves as the living area for both students and academic staff.

Pukou Campus is situated in the suburban Pukou District, by the northern side of Nanjing New &amp; High-Tech Industry Development Zone, and became part of Nanjing University in 1993. Once Pukou campus hosted undergraduate freshmen, sophomore and junior students. In 2009, the Pukou campus became the campus hosted the undergraduate students in Nanjing University Jinling College, which was founded by Nanjing University in 1998. Nanjing University Biomedical Research Institute is also located in Pukou.

Xianlin Campus is located in the northeast of Nanjing, in the Xianlin Universities Town, south of [[Yangtse River]] and [[Qixia Mountain]], east of [[Purple Mountain (Nanjing)|Purple Mountain]], and west of [[Baohua Mountain]]. The campus is home to undergraduate students and parts of graduate students. It was opened in September 2009. There is the stop of Nanjing University Xianlin Campus on Line 2 of [[Nanjing Subway]], which enables Xianlin and Gulou campus to be connected through subway.

In Gulou campus, there are several museums including Nanjing University Museum, Museum of Art and Archaeology, Museum of Earth Science. There is [[Sun Yat-sen House (Nanjing)|Sun Yat-sen House]]. It's said that [[Sun Yat-sen]], the first president (provisional president) of the Republic of China, lived there. There are also [[Pearl Buck]] House, [[John Rabe House]], etc.. Gulou campus is now becoming mainly for professional graduate campus.

The location of Nanjing University has changed for several times, with historical campuses mainly in [[Fuzimiao]] (on the bank of [[Qinhuai River]]), Gulou, [[Chaotian Palace|Chaotiangong]] and Sipailou (south of [[Qintian Mountain]]) areas. In addition, during [[Anti-Japanese War]], its main campus moved to Shapingba, [[Chungking]], with two auxiliary campuses, one in Bohsi, Chungking, and one in Hwahsiba, [[Chengdu]], in some sense combined with [[Chongqing University]] and Western China University (now medical school of [[Sichuan University]]) respectively. It also deserves to mention that before the war, with the rapid development of the university, a new campus planned to cover an area of 8000 mu (about {{convert|5.3|km2|disp=or|abbr=on}}) south to Niushou Mountain in the southern suburb area of Nanjing had been built for near a year. After the war, it moved back to Nanjing, making former campus Sipailou as main campus, and the new campus Dingjiaqiao was built for agriculture and medical schools. Nanjing University relocated in Gulou six years after moving back, and then near sixty years later Xianlin campus emerged. Today's Nanjing University Gulou campus is the location of Imperial University of Nanjing during [[Former Song dynasty]] in more than 1500 years ago when it was in the west of the city, and now it's in the centre of the city.

== Culture ==

=== School motto ===
Officially translated into English as "Sincerity with Aspiration, Perseverance and Integrity". Another version is "Be Honest and Intelligent, Study Hard and Act Sincerely."({{zh|t=誠樸雄偉 勵學敦行|s=诚朴雄伟 励学敦行|hp=chéng pǔ xióng wěi lì xué dūn xíng|links=no}})

The first half of this motto was the motto during the National Central University time, and the last half was quoted from the classic literature work ''[[Book of Rites]]''. It was voted to be the motto by university students in 2002, and the then university president supported it and wrote an article to interpret it.&lt;ref name="Official State of school motto"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nju.edu.cn/html/ndgk/xgxx/1.html|title=School motto|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140630225002/http://nju.edu.cn/html/ndgk/xgxx/1.html|archivedate=2014-06-30|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The translation does not fully express the meaning of the Chinese words of the motto. Motto counterparts between Chinese and English literally: Cheng (诚, Sincerity, Honesty, Integrity), [[Pu (Daoism)|Pu]] (樸, Simplicity, Austerity, naturally being oneself), Xiong (雄, Sturdiness, Majesty, being vigorous and keeping ideal and ambition, being firm and persistent with fortitude), Wei (偉, Greatness, having great ideal and ambition, with great mind comprehending, containing and improving world), Li Xue (勵學, Endeavor to Learn), Dun Xing (敦行, Urge to Act, Act Sincerely). The term Dun Xing comes from the context in [[Book of Rites]]: Having broad knowledge and strong learning ability and being modest, acting in sincerity and benignity and not slack, that is a gentleman (gentleperson) (博聞強識而讓 敦善行而不怠 謂之君子).

=== School song ===
The school song, recovered in 2002, was created in 1916. It is the first school song in the modern history of Nanjing University, with the lyrics written by [[Jiang Qian]] and melody composed by [[Li Shutong]] ({{lang|zh-hans|李叔同}}).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nju.edu.cn/html/ndgk/xgxx/1.html School song of Nanjing University] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140630225002/http://nju.edu.cn/html/ndgk/xgxx/1.html |date=2014-06-30 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Anniversary ===
The present school anniversary is on May 20 every year, which was set by the school authority in 1954 in some sense due to some ideological reasons of the time, with the starting year being 1902 when relaunching the school as a modern higher learning institution, and the day May 20 in memory of the movement of anti-hunger and anti-war initiated by the university in that day of 1947. In recent years, the date May 20 has another new meaning: in Chinese Nanjing pronunciation, 5.20, sounds like I Love You (Wu Ai Ni). It shows students' love to their Alma Mater.

== Recent status ==

=== Recent developments and present status ===
The School of Modern Engineering and Applied Sciences was established in 2009, replacing former School of Technological Sciences. NU received a RMB 400 million endowment gift from enterpriser Yang Xiu on the anniversary day in 2012, 300 million was designated for the establishment of engineering school and the rest for history study development fund. The Engineering Building covering floor space of 6000 sqm was started to construct in Xianlin campus in 2014.

The '''National Geographic GeoBee''' (called the '''National Geography Bee''' from 1989-2000 and the '''National Geographic Bee''' from 2001-2018,&lt;ref&gt;https://www.nationalgeographic.org/bee&lt;/ref&gt; also referred to as the '''Nat Geo Bee''') is an annual [[geography]] contest sponsored by the [[National Geographic Society]]. The [[Communal work|bee]], held every year since 1989, is open to students in the fourth through eighth grades in participating schools from the [[United States]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.nationalgeographic.com/geobee/&lt;/ref&gt;

The entities represented at the national level come from all fifty [[U.S. state|States]], all the [[U.S. territories]], the [[Department of Defense Dependents Schools|U.S. Department of Defense Dependents Schools]] (DoDDS), and the [[District of Columbia]].

The National Geographic Bee Finals was moderated by ''[[Jeopardy!]]'' host [[Alex Trebek]] for its first 25 years (1989-2013). However, at the [[25th National Geographic Bee|2013 National Geographic Bee]], Trebek announced that 2013 would be his last year hosting the Finals. Newscaster [[Soledad O'Brien]] took his place the following year, moderating the bee in [[26th National Geographic Bee|2014]] and [[27th National Geographic Bee|2015]]. O'Brien was then replaced by [[Mo Rocca]] in [[28th National Geographic Bee|2016]], [[29th National Geographic Bee|2017]], and [[30th National Geographic Bee|2018]].

The current champion is Venkat Ranjan, from [[Windemere Ranch Middle School]] in [[San Ramon, California]].

==Procedure==

===School competitions===
The competition begins at the [[Elementary school (United States)|elementary school]] and middle school levels (4th grade - 8th grade) and usually occurs in November, December, or January. This competition requires at least 6 people to enter. Private, public, and homeschooled students are allowed to enter. Typically, between five and six million students are entered each year (any number of competitors may enter this competition). The two major stages in this competition are called the preliminary and the final stages. Often, the preliminary competition is further split into preliminary rounds and a semi-final. In the event of a tie, a [[tiebreaker]] round is held at the end of the preliminary rounds.

In the preliminary rounds, competitors are divided into groups of twenty and each contestant is asked one question from each of the eight themed rounds.  Categories include:
*[[Cultural geography|Cultural Geography]]
*[[Economic geography|Economic Geography]]
*[[Geography of the United States|Across-the-Country]], [[World (geography)|Around-the-World]]
*[[Science]]
* Geographic Comparisons
*[[Physical geography|Physical Geography]]
* Odd-Item-Out (a category where one contestant is given three choices, plus a description. The contestant must determine which of the three choices does not fit.)
Contestants are awarded 1 point per question. At the end of seven rounds, players with the top ten scores advance to the finals. In addition to the game, a player may ask for a repeat of a [[spelling]] during these rounds. However, they are restricted to only asking twice in duration of the entire geographic bee.

Quite often there is a [[Tie (draw)|tie]], in which case a semi-final tiebreaker round is needed. For example, if six players finished the preliminary rounds with eight points and fifteen finished with seven points, the six who finished with eight points automatically advance to the final competition. The fifteen with seven points move into the semi-final round where the top four are determined to fill the remainder of the seats in the finals. This is done by asking every player the same question at the same time and giving each player twelve seconds to write down the answer. Each question is automatically repeated twice.  Everyone reveals their answer at the end of the twelve seconds and players are eliminated on a single-elimination basis.  If, using the above example of four open seats in the finals, there is a question where eight players are left in the semi-final round and three players get the question right, those three advance to the finals. The other five who got the question wrong will continue with the single-elimination procedure to determine which competitor will take the last open seat in the finals. A player cannot ask judges to spell or repeat words in the semi-final round.

The final competition consists of two parts: the final round and the championship round. Each of the ten finalists starts with a clean slate and is eliminated after two incorrect answers. This continues until the number of contestants drops from ten to two and a third-place finisher is determined. A player is not officially eliminated until the end of a series of questions, since if all but one competitor makes their second miss in that round, all the players stay in the competition. Again, a player may ask for a spelling or repeat on any question, but only once per question. Earlier in the round, questions may require oral answers or written answers from all the competitors at one time. Quite often, many of the earlier questions in this round contain visuals as part of the question, such as [[map]]s or pictures. Question examples in the past have included pictures of state quarters with the name rubbed off and maps of the US with national forests shown and numbered. Contestants, at the time, were given the name of the national forest and (he or she) must match states with trees. At the national level, competitions may include items such as [[flag]]s, [[musical instrument]]s, [[hat]]s, and even live animals. After a certain round, all questions must require oral answers only.

If there is a tie for the championship round or third place, there will be an elimination round. For example, if four players are left and three make their second mistake, the fourth advances to the championship round and the other three enter the tiebreaker. The moderator will then ask each of the three players, at the same time, to write their answers to the same question. In this special round, questions can be repeated by players but they cannot ask how to spell a given word. As a result, if one of three responses are correct, he or she will rise to the championship round and the other two will move to the tiebreaker round until a third-place winner determined.

In the championship round, both players start with a clean slate again. The moderator asks both contestants the same question at the same time, repeated twice, and both players have fifteen seconds to write their answer. Both players then show their answers and each player who wrote a correct answer receives one point. There are three questions in the championship round. The player with the most points at the end is the champion. If both players are tied at the end, the competition enters the championship tiebreaker round. The rules are the same as for the championship round, except that the last player to answer a question incorrectly is the runner-up.

In 2010, National Geographic partnered with mobile development company [[Concentric Sky]] to launch a series of official app-based study tools titled Geobee Challenge.&lt;ref&gt;http://projects.registerguard.com/csp/cms/sites/web/business/24893551-46/concentric-national-geographic-skipper-sky.csp&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Qualifying Test '''

The Qualifying Test is the only part of the bee that is entirely written. Every school champion takes this test to see if he or she can qualify for the state bee. The test comprises 70 multiple choice questions, which must be completed in 60 minutes. The top 100 scorers in each state or territory advance to the state level competition. Beginning with the 2016 Bee, the Qualifying test is online, and no longer is administered on paper.&lt;ref&gt;http://patch.com/new-york/wantagh/wantagh-student-heading-states-national-geographic-bee&lt;/ref&gt;

===State and national competitions===
The winner of each school-level competition takes an online test, and the top 100 in each state or territory qualify for the State Bee. If there is a tie in the State Qualifying Test, all students in the tie get an invitation to the State Bee (i.e. there were 105 State Bee Qualifiers in the 2018 California State Geographic Bee). The rules at the state level are same as that at the school level, except that there are eight preliminary rounds instead of seven and each player is limited to two repeats or spelling for all eight preliminary rounds. Players are also limited to two repeats or spellings in the final round if they qualify. All the state bees are held on the same date, at the same time (in early April or late March) at all locations. The most recent Bee was held on 6 April 2018. State bees originally occurred for the fifty states, five U.S. territories (Guam, Puerto Rico, US Virgin Islands, American Samoa, Northern Mariana Islands), [[Washington, D.C.]], and the [[Department of Defense Dependent Schools]] (DoDDS), for a total of 57. The third-place finisher from each state receives $50, the second-place finisher $75, and the winner $100. ( The 2018 state Bee doubled that price.) In 1999 the state competitions for Guam, American Samoa, and Northern Mariana Islands were merged into one state competition known as the Pacific Territories, bringing the number down to 55. In 2009, the Puerto Rico and US Virgin Islands competitions were merged into a single competition known as the Atlantic Territories, and since then there have only been 54 state competitions. The 54 state champions receive an all-expense paid trip to Washington, D.C. for the national competition.

The rules at the national level are the same as those at the state, except that there are ten preliminary rounds instead of eight. There was also a video part of the prelims where students submitted a video worth 6 points, but was replaced by a written test. The championship round can also consist of five questions instead of three. The competition is held over four days, with the preliminary rounds on the first day and the final rounds on the third. The national finals are held in late May at [[National Geographic Society]] headquarters in Washington, D.C. and are hosted by [[Mo Rocca]]. The ten finalists are guaranteed $500. The third-place finisher receives a $10,000 college scholarship, the second-place finisher receives a $25,000 college scholarship, and the National Champion receives a $50,000 college scholarship, as well as a lifetime membership in the [[National Geographic Society]]. From 2009 to 2015, the National Champion also won a trip to the [[Galápagos Islands]]. In 2016, National Champion Rishi Nair won a trip to southeast [[Alaska]], including a stop at [[Glacier Bay National Park]]. This was because 2016 was the centenary of the [[National Park Service|U.S. National Park Service]]. 2017 National Champion, Pranay Varada, received a trip to the Galápagos Islands. The Top Ten format is also different from state. Originally, it was the same format, but in 2012, they changed it where correct answers are worth points, and a bonus question can earn you extra points as well, with eliminations being every few rounds. In 2015, they adopted the current format. There are no longer bonus questions, and the first five rounds are USA based and worth one point for most questions. The fifth round is a “lightning round” where you are asked three rapid fire questions. Then, four students with the lowest scores are eliminated, a tie being broken with a tiebreaker about estimation. The next four rounds are global and are all worth two points per question, and end again with another lightning round. After this, the top three are left. There are two “GeoChallenges” in the final competition, one worth three points in round 3, and for the top ten a 45-second oral response worth six points. The top two then compete in a normal championship round.

===International competition===
{{main|National Geographic World Championship}}
There was an [[National Geographic World Championship|international competition]], which was also moderated by [[Alex Trebek]], but it was run differently. The top finishers from each country's national competition formed a team representing their country and participated in an [[Olympics|Olympic]]-style event which included a team written competition and a team oral competition. The 2013 competition was held in [[Saint Petersburg, Russia]]. The 2015 [[National Geographic World Championship]], originally planned to take place in [[Stockholm, Sweden]], was canceled, and the competition was since put on hiatus.

===Criticism===
The selection process of the National Geographic GeoBee competition is not well designed to reliably promote the most qualified contestants as it leaves significant room for chance. This is due to the small number of questions and the fact that each contestant answers different questions.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.nationalgeographic.org/bee/faq&lt;/ref&gt; Particularly, during the preliminary rounds contestants are eliminated with a single mistake if there are more than 9 perfect scores.
The fact that a single mistake is not a reliable indicator for a contestant's overall strength was demonstrated during the [[26th National Geographic Bee|2014 National competition]]. The preliminary rounds resulted in 9 contestants with perfect score who accordingly became finalists. The 10th spot was filled by tie breaker rounds between contestants who made a single mistake during the preliminaries and went to the Virginia champion [http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2014/05/140521-geography-bee-national-geographic-world-scholarship-students/ Akhil Rekulapelli], who then went on to win the finals.

==Champions==

===National Champions===
Of the twenty-nine National Geographic GeoBee champions, twenty-seven are male and two are female. Five are from the state of [[Washington (state)|Washington]], four are from the state of [[Michigan]], four are from [[Texas]], two are from [[Kansas]], two are from [[New Jersey]], two are from [[Florida]], and various other states have been home to one champion each.

'''''Ngapartji Ngapartji''''' was a community development and Indigenous language maintenance/[[Language revitalization|revitalisation]] project produced by the Australian arts and social change company [[Big hART|Big ''h''ART]] conducted in various locations across the [[Anangu]], [[Pitjantjatjara]] and [[Yankunytjatjara dialect|Yankunytjatjara]] [[Apy lands|(APY) Lands]] in [[Central Australia]] and in [[Alice Springs]].&lt;ref&gt;Sometimes, Beth et al: “Ngapartji Ngapartji; Indigenous Languages in the Arts”, in: Hobson, John et al: Re-Awakening Languages. Theory and Practice in the Revitalisation of Australia’s Indigenous Languages, Sydney: Sydney University Press, 2010. p.86| quote= Ngapartji Ngapartji participants include young people from Alice Springs town camps such as Abbott’s Camp, Anangu Pitjantjatjara Yankunytjatjara (APY) land residents who have shifted to Alice because they or their partners are in need of renal dialysis, and both young people and Elders from remote communities – in particular Ernabella, on the APY lands. The project has worked with around 300 participants since 2005 and about 25 of those have come on one or more of the nine national tours of Ngapartji Ngapartji.&lt;/ref&gt; The project ran from 2005 to 2010 with spin-off projects and related performances. The project was structured around an experimental and reflexive arts-based [[Community development|community development program]] which included the creation of an online interactive language and culture learning website by Pitjantjatjara-speaking young people, elders and [[linguists]]; a [[bilingual]] touring [[theatre]] work and a [[media campaign]] promoting the development of an Australian national Indigenous [[language policy]].&lt;ref&gt;Somestimes, Beth et al: “Ngapartji Ngapartji; Indigenous Languages in the Arts”, in: Hobson, John et al: Re-Awakening Languages. Theory and Practive in the Revitalisation of Australia’s Indigenous Languages, Sydney: Sydney University Press, 2010. p.84 |quote= Ngapartji Ngapartji was a high-profile arts, theatre and language maintenance and revitalisation promotion project produced by social-change company Big hART. Since 2005 Ngapartji Ngapartji has been operating an innovative and experimental program which includes: the creation of an online interactive language and culture learning website, working with Pitjantjatjara-speaking young people, Elders and linguists; an arts-based community development program; a highly successful touring theatre work which is performed bilingually and a media campaign promoting the development of a national Indigenous languages policy.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Objectives==
''Ngapartji Ngapartji''’s main objective was to effect a sustained positive change in various [[disadvantaged]], struggling [[Indigenous Australians|Indigenous]] communities by offering local individuals opportunities to engage with their [[cultural capital]] in arts-based practice. Through the creation of [[art]] in various forms, Big ''h''ART sought to maintain and [[Language revitalization|revitalise]] the Pitjantjatjara language and thus to preserve cultural knowledge, to improve general [[literacy]] levels (defined as both the ability to read and write as well as the ability to engage in a culturally meaningful manner with [[new media]] and [[modern technology]]) and to promote [[social cohesion]] as a [[crime prevention]] measure.&lt;ref&gt;Palmer, Dave: Ngapartji Ngapartji: The Consequences of Kindness, Perth: Murdoch University, 2010. p. 14-20&lt;/ref&gt; It was part of the project’s aim to “positively [profile] the strength of culture at a time where health and social issues [were] dominating […] media [accounts of the region and its people].”.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/2006-10-23/indigenous-theatre-heads-for-sydney-opera-house/1292716 |title=Indigenous Theatre Heads for Sydney Opera House |work=ABC News |date=23 Oct 2006 |accessdate=15 Jan 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On a global scale, the project aimed to raise awareness, interest and appreciation of Indigenous languages in general and to provide a [[Conceptual model|model]] for [[Language revitalization|revitalisation]] of endangered languages.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ourlanguages.net.au/language-centres/item/ngapartji-ngapartji.html |title=Ngapartji Ngapartji |work=Our Languages |date=November 2009 |accessdate=15 Jan 2013 |quote= Ultimately it is hoped that the profile of the Ngapartji Ngapartji project and its model generate a broader understanding of and interest in the value and preservation of all Indigenous languages, not just Pitjantjatjara.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The online language course created as part of the project [was] “to encourage audience interaction and introduce people to a language and culture they may not have experienced before” as well as to generate interest among Indigenous communities themselves to maintain their cultural capital.

==Project==
Between 1955 and 1963 the British military was given permission to conduct a number of [[British nuclear tests at Maralinga|nuclear tests]] around [[Maralinga]] in the [[South Australia]]n desert. After initially downplaying the environmental and social impacts of those tests, the Australian and UK governments conceded in 1994 to a payment of AUD$13.5 million in compensation to the local [[Maralinga Tjarutja]] people.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bmamag.com/articles/exhibitionist/20120717-ngapartji-ngpartji/ |title=Ngapartji Ngapartji One |work=by Ben Hermann for BMA Magazine |date=17 Jul 2012 |accessdate=15 Jan 2013 |quote= Between 1955 and 1963 the British conducted a number of nuclear tests in the Maralinga Desert near Woomera, South Australia. Despite an initial 'cleanup' in 1967, in 1985 it was conceded that significant radiation hazards existed in the area. In 1994, nearly 40 years after the tests began, the Australian Government acknowledged the severe effect the tests had on the Aboriginal owners of the land and paid $13.5 million in compensation to the local Maralinga Tjarutja people. }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The research for a planned [[theatre]] show on actor [[Trevor Jamieson|Trevor Jamieson’s]] family brought him and [[Big hART|Big ''h''ART]]’s creative director [[Scott Rankin]] and producer [[Alex Kelly (filmmaker)|Alex Kelly]] to the [[Apy lands|APY Lands]] where many of the displaced Maralinga Tjarutja people found shelter. Consultations with community elders and the Jamieson’s extended family about the regions’ history and contemporary challenges brought forth first ideas about the project's focus and structure.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bmamag.com/articles/exhibitionist/20120717-ngapartji-ngpartji/ |title=Ngapartji Ngapartji One |work=by Ben Hermann for BMA Magazine |date=17 Jul 2012 |accessdate=15 Jan 2013 |quote="My side was to look at the storytelling of the families out in the desert," Jamieson says of the creative development of the production by him and Rankin. "I went out and sat down with the elders and got the testimonies of the people who actually witnessed [the nuclear testing]."  }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2002, the play ''Career Highlights of the Mamu''&lt;ref&gt;http://trove.nla.gov.au/work/31674435?versionId=38410944&lt;/ref&gt; represented the first stage in the theatrical exploration of the family’s story.&lt;ref&gt;Grehan, Helena: Performance, Ethics and Spectatorship in a Global Age, Basinstoke: Palgrave Macmillan, 2009. p.63-92&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2005, [[Alex Kelly (filmmaker)|Kelly]] moved to [[Alice Springs]] and started to establish further contacts with community members, organisations and institutions across the APY Lands.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.abc.net.au/local/audio/2011/09/14/3317775.htm |title= Guestroom - Alex Kelly |work=by Kate O'Toole and Miranda Tetlow for ABC |date= 20 Sep 2011 |accessdate= 23 Nov 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The objective of this early stage was to meet locals, to listen to their stories and their first-hand accounts of issues facing their communities and to learn about local ideas on how to tackle those problems. At the heart of the issues people repeatedly identified in the [[Public consultation|consultations]] lay two causes: [[Social alienation|alienation]] between the [[Generation|generations]] and an imminent loss of the Pitjantjatjara language and culture.&lt;ref&gt;Somestimes, Beth et al: “Ngapartji Ngapartji; Indigenous Languages in the Arts”, in: Hobson, John et al: Re-Awakening Languages. Theory and Practive in the Revitalisation of Australia’s Indigenous Languages, Sydney: Sydney University Press, 2010. p.85 |accessdate=15 Jan 2013 |quote= Pitjantjatjara can be seen as a strong language with over 2500 speakers across northern South Australia, the south of the Northern Territory and into Western Australia. However Pitjantjatjara is still regarded as endangered as it is changing substantially among generations with classical Pitjantjatjara being spoken less and less by young people. The domains of the language are shrinking, especially among young people, and particularly those young people that no longer live on traditional Pitjantjatjara country, but in towns such as Alice Springs, Port Augusta, Coober Pedy and Adelaide where they speak a mix of Pitjantjatjara, English and other Indigenous languages such as Luritja and Arrernte.&lt;/ref&gt;

A challenge for [[Big hART|Big ''h''ART]] workers and community members involved was to find a suitable framework that would capture the imagination of both old and young and would bring them together in a meaningful exchange.&lt;ref&gt;Palmer, Dave: Ngapartji Ngapartji: The Consequences of Kindness, Perth: Murdoch University, 2010. p.45&lt;/ref&gt; The development of a second mainstage theatre production taking place in interaction with the [[Ernabella]] (SA) community provided one possible field of interaction. To allow for a more targeted approach in language maintenance, the development of an integrated online language course based on short film-clips proved to be another: The technological aspect and fun of creating film and [[digital media]] appealed to a large number of young people whilst elders were able to pass on language and cultural knowledge in a setting which fostered respect for their wealth of experience.&lt;ref&gt;Sometimes, Beth et al: “Ngapartji Ngapartji; Indigenous Languages in the Arts”, in: Hobson, John et al: Re-Awakening Languages. Theory and Practice in the Revitalisation of Australia’s Indigenous Languages, Sydney: Sydney University Press, 2010. p.86 |quote=Through producing work that engages multiple age groups from the community, an intergenerational exchange occurs with a language focus. Ninti Mulapa translates as highly knowledgeable and is the name given to the language reference group made up of senior Pitjantjatjara people who advise and consult on aspects of Ngapartji Ngapartji, in particular the Ninti website, created as a language and culture learning forum. Through the process of reviewing film and other content created by young people both in town and out bush, these senior people are able to re-engage with communities from which they are separated, consult on subject matter and monitor language use.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Sometimes, Beth et al: “Ngapartji Ngapartji; Indigenous Languages in the Arts”, in: Hobson, John et al: Re-Awakening Languages. Theory and Practice in the Revitalisation of Australia’s Indigenous Languages, Sydney: Sydney University Press, 2010. p.88 |quote= The engagement of young speakers in developing content in their own languages in turn empowers communities. A multigenerational approach enhances language use as a broader part of cultural continuity. Engaging young community members through language-based activities gives access to Elders who have the relevant cultural and life experience to understand the importance of language revitalisation, whilst legitimising the cultural forms to which young people are attracted.&lt;/ref&gt; In a series of workshops, artists associated with [[Big hART|Big ''h''ART]] developed short film clips on country with a group of youngsters from town camps and remote communities, while elders were providing and advising on the content of the language lessons.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ourlanguages.net.au/language-centres/item/ngapartji-ngapartji.html |title=Ngapartji Ngapartji |work=Our Languages |date=November 2009 |accessdate=15 Jan 2013 |quote= A language and culture reference group, Ninti Mulapa, comprising senior Pitjantjatjara elders and language workers, oversees and reviews the cultural and linguistic appropriateness of site content }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Over the course of the project, this kind of working environment fostered mutual learning that allowed participants to experience themselves and others as creative and productive co-workers as well as helping to reduce the [[Social alienation|alienation]] between the generations.&lt;ref&gt;Sometimes, Beth et al: “Ngapartji Ngapartji; Indigenous Languages in the Arts”, in: Hobson, John et al: Re-Awakening Languages.

Both younger and older Pitjantjatjara participants engage[d] with broader dialogue concerning language, and in discussion around emerging conceptual realms regarding the experiences that [were] being shared.".&lt;ref&gt;Sometimes, Beth et al: “Ngapartji Ngapartji; Indigenous Languages in the Arts”, in: Hobson, John et al: Re-Awakening Languages. Theory and Practice in the Revitalisation of Australia’s Indigenous Languages, Sydney: Sydney University Press, 2010. p.86&lt;/ref&gt;

Many of the films were, in addition to being uploaded onto the ninti-website, published on DVD compilations and distributed by the young people across their communities.&lt;ref&gt;Palmer, Dave: Ngapartji Ngapartji: The Consequences of Kindness, Perth: Murdoch University, 2010. p. 27&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Sometimes, Beth et al: “Ngapartji Ngapartji; Indigenous Languages in the Arts”, in: Hobson, John et al: Re-Awakening Languages.

Activities included song writing, performing, voice training, recording and sampling. As well as bringing artists to remote communities to conduct those workshops, [[Big hART|Big ''h''ART]] also partnered with the record label ‘Tracks of the Desert’ to record and publish project material, i.e. the “Ngurakutu Ara” CD in [[Ernabella]] (SA) with proceeds going towards purchasing musical equipment for the community. All songs and other materials recorded in the project have been made available to the communities by way of portable storage media and by uploading material onto publicly accessible computers.&lt;ref&gt;Palmer, Dave: Ngapartji Ngapartji: The Consequences of Kindness, Perth: Murdoch University, 2010. p. 28&lt;/ref&gt;

Especial care was taken to afford the young people as much exposure for their artworks as possible to enhance the experience of appreciation and to incite communication and reflection. Participants presented the project and their works at conferences and festivals while a strong media strategy ensured regular coverage on local and national level.&lt;ref&gt;Palmer, Dave: Ngapartji Ngapartji: The Consequences of Kindness, Perth: Murdoch University, 2010. p. 25&lt;/ref&gt;

To afford opportunities for the expansion of professional skills, creative developments of the associated theatre show were organised in [[Ernabella]] (SA) to give people the chance to observe working processes, to grow and to participate in various capacities on and off-stage, i.e. by joining the multiple tours of the production to national festivals as paid performers or assisting technicians.&lt;ref&gt;Palmer, Dave: Ngapartji Ngapartji: The Consequences of Kindness, Perth: Murdoch University, 2010. p. 25/33&lt;/ref&gt;

In order to maximise the impact of [[Language revitalization|language revitalisation]], [[Big hART|Big ''h''ART]] collaborated with the ‘Centre for Aboriginal Economic Policy and Research’ of the [[Australian National University]] (ANU) whose researchers advised on the literacy elements of the project while conducting a three-year study,&lt;ref&gt;Kral, Inge &amp; Schwab, Robert G.: ''Learning spaces: Youth, Literacy and New Media in Remote Indigenous Australia'', Canberra: ANU E Press, 2012&lt;/ref&gt; as part of the ‘Lifespan Learning and Literacy in Remote Indigenous Communities 2007-10’ ANU and Fred Hollows Foundation linkeage project.&lt;ref&gt;Palmer, Dave: Ngapartji Ngapartji: The Consequences of Kindness, Perth: Murdoch University, 2010. p. 53&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Palmer, Dave: Ngapartji Ngapartji: The Consequences of Kindness, Perth: Murdoch University, 2010. p. 68&lt;/ref&gt; Improvement of literacy in both Pitjantjatjara and English was a strong element of the project: As many participants had had negative experiences with formal education settings and [[shame]] being a strong inhibitor to participation in Indigenous communities, literacy was playfully integrated into the general workshop activities and ‘trained on the job’. This tied in with the asset-based approach [[Big hART|Big ''h''ART]] adopted for the project in that the task-focus was laid on the story while literacy skills were imparted by way of accessing this story and supporting the individuals in translating it into art.&lt;ref&gt;Palmer, Dave: Ngapartji Ngapartji: The Consequences of Kindness, Perth: Murdoch University, 2010. p. 73/74&lt;/ref&gt;

Together with the [[Australian National University|ANU]] researchers and other experts in the field, [[Big hART|Big ''h''ART]] commenced to push for a change in national [[policy]] regarding the maintenance of Indigenous languages in Australia as part of the project’s legacy which eventually prompted the release of the Commonwealth Government’s strategy paper "Indigenous Languages – A National Approach" in August 2009 and the tabling of the [http://www.aph.gov.au/parliamentary_business/committees/house_of_representatives_committees?url=atsia/languages/report/index.htm House of Representatives Standing Committee Report into Indigenous Language Learning].&lt;ref&gt;Sometimes, Beth et al: “Ngapartji Ngapartji; Indigenous Languages in the Arts”, in: Hobson, John et al: Re-Awakening Languages.

The two pillars of the project, the Pitjantjatjara language course and the performance piece, kept informing each other throughout the project.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ourlanguages.net.au/language-centres/item/ngapartji-ngapartji.html |title=Ngapartji Ngapartji |work=Our Languages |date=November 2009 |accessdate=15 Jan 2013 |quote= Young people and elders, along with arts mentors and language workers, [were] producing diverse linguistic and cultural material for Ngapartji Ngapartji''s online language and culture site, Ninti ([[ninti.ngapartji.org]]).

The play has lead actor [[Trevor Jamieson]] recounting his family’s story, situating it in the larger context of the [[British nuclear tests at Maralinga|British nuclear testing around Maralinga]]. The show explores themes of dispossession and displacement from country, home and family,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.currency.com.au/product_detail.aspx?productid=2516 |title=Namatjira/Ngapartji Ngapartji |work=Currency Press |year=2012 |accessdate=15 Jan 2013 |quote=Exploring themes of dispossession and displacement from country, home and family, the play tells the story of a Pitjantjatjara family forcibly moved off their lands to make way for the testing of British Atomic bombs at Maralinga.}}&lt;/ref&gt; yet within this political constellation, the focus remains firmly on the detrimental impacts the events had on the social fabric and cultural life of the Indigenous people of the region.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.australianstage.com.au/201207265644/reviews/canberra/ngapartji-ngapartji-%7c-big-hart.html |title=Ngapartji Ngapartji, Big hART |work=by Trevan Allan Chilver for Australian Stage |date=27 Jul 2012 |accessdate=29 Jul 2012 |quote= Of course the story of the Maralinga tests is invariably political, but while Ngapartji Ngapartji addresses the political context, this story is about the people whose way of life, culture and heritage was irrevocably changed by events so extraordinarily remote from the centre of their world.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As Ben Hermann notes, the play “mixes traditional storytelling, tragedy, humour, pop-culture references and direct audience participation to both entertain and educate audiences about the history of Indigenous Australians”.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bmamag.com/articles/exhibitionist/20120717-ngapartji-ngpartji/ |title=Ngapartji Ngapartji One |work=by Ben Hermann for BMA Magazine |date=17 Jul 2012 |accessdate=15 Jan 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The feature of direct participation awards [[audiences]] opportunities to learn Pitjantjatjara words and phrases, thus tying-in the show with the language focus of the larger project. As a whole, Sometimes argues, “''Ngapartji Ngapartji'' […] exposed the general public to Indigenous language in an emotive context – theatre – providing a platform for meaningful engagement and giving liberty to understanding.".&lt;ref&gt;Sometimes, Beth et al: “Ngapartji Ngapartji; Indigenous Languages in the Arts”, in: Hobson, John et al: Re-Awakening Languages. Theory and Practice in the Revitalisation of Australia’s Indigenous Languages, Sydney: Sydney University Press, 2010. p.88&lt;/ref&gt;

===Plot synopsis===
The [[Play (theatre)|play]] starts out in its [[bilingual]] form with an introduction given by Trevor Jamieson in which he establishes his troubled brother Jangala as the touchstone of his narrative. The following show sets out to contextualise his story within the larger family story which in turn is framed by the political history of their home-country, the [[Spinifex people|Spinifex]] nation of the South Australian desert which encompasses the [[British nuclear tests at Maralinga|British nuclear testing site of Maralinga]].

Before jumping into the narrative which spans 60 years of dislocation and emotional [[Psychological trauma|trauma]], the cast (an Indigenous choir, members of the Jamieson family and a group of non-Indigenous, Australian actors from mixed ethnic backgrounds) teaches the children’s song ‘[[Head, Shoulders, Knees and Toes|Head, Shoulder, Knees and Toes]]’ in Pitjantjatjara to the audience. The song resurfaces throughout the performance in different languages and contexts to signal and remind of a common humanity all people on earth share.&lt;ref&gt;while later also turning into a reference for a body infested with cancer&lt;/ref&gt; To strengthen this theme and to open up an emotive space of understanding, the show also makes use of a wide array of popular songs translated into Pitjantjatjara and performed [[bilingual]]ly.

The family story then quickly proceeds from the family-focalised first encounters with [[Afghans in Australia|Afghan Australian]] people in the desert to the beginnings of Christian missionary endeavours.

Intersecting the family story is a larger global narrative of the [[Second World War]] and its annihilating race for [[Atom bomb|nuclear power]] which will invariably come to affect the Jamieson’s as their home-country is turned into a nuclear testing ground. The links established by this narrative eventually all tie in with the family story and serve to turn the abstract, political frame into an intimately personal one in which accountability and impact can no longer be deferred onto the distant and [[Other (philosophy)|other]].&lt;ref&gt;i.e. through the stereotypical role of the Japanese as archenemy being turned inside out as references to their alliance in World War 1 precedes the haunting account of Japanese dancer Yumi Umiumare as a mother experiencing atom bombs melting her world beyond recognition which again resonates with the trauma experienced by the Indigenous families; through the story of British Prime Minister [[Tony Blair]]’s mother sheltering him from a radioactive cloud passing over Adelaide with the mention of her death caused by [[cancer]] years later; or through the non-Indigenous Australian soldier who signed up as a volunteer to support his government in the Maralinga tests and finds himself poisoned and written out of his country’s history&lt;/ref&gt;

The story resumes with father Arnold Jamieson being born on country just before the family is moved to Cundalee mission ca. 440&amp;nbsp;km west of their home country. The strain of dislocation and attempts to save as many family members as possible while evacuation measures of the government fall short of communicating over the cultural divide, eventually break up the grandparents’ marriage, ending in the murder of the grandmother by the grandfather. The story then follows Arnold on his journey into adulthood, longing for his country while restricted to far-away missions. The love and belonging he finds with his wife Gail opens up the hope for a new beginning beyond trauma and sorrow. Overcoming, however, is barred by the murder of Gail’s mother on her way to the wedding by a taxi-driver and the vision of more and more Pitjantjatjara people losing their way in between the two cultures. As cultural protocols are explained, the audience is invited to consider the adopted solutions for reconciliation in Australia from an Indigenous perspective.
The last third of the show is increasingly interspersed with video footage of intimate family conversations revolving around the worry for Jangala’s life in this culturally divided space, bringing the focus back onto the brother and present issues facing the displaced Spinifex people in their country. The play ends on a note that affirms Indigenous persistence and survival, expressing hope to be one day released from the cycle of trauma and sorrow.

===Production history===
''Ngapartji Ngapartji'' has toured Australia extensively in between 2005 and 2008 with the show undergoing various developments throughout its production history. In 2012, the show was revived in [[Canberra]] in a condensed version under the name ''Ngapartji One''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.canberratimes.com.au/entertainment/stage/memories-of-atomic-horror-20120713-21zel.html#ixzz2I04FlyPA |title= Memories of Atomic Horror |work=by Diana Streak for Canberra Times |date=Jul 14, 2012  |accessdate=15 Jan 2013 |quote= Ngapartji Ngapartji  has been around for nearly a decade morphing through a variety of forms and sizes. The version coming to Canberra is a distillation of the story and includes Jamieson's experiences of telling it over the years, including a heart-wrenching decision whether to include references to his father after he died. It was originally a sweeping narrative work with a large cast that included a choir, elders teaching Pitjantjatjara language, storytelling, singing and dancing.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legacy==
The ''Ngapartji Ngapartji'' project officially wrapped in 2010. However, in order to create a tangible legacy of the project, [[Big hART|Big ''h''ART]] produced a range of media illustrating the project’s journey:

The media kit ‘Memory Basket’ “captures the story of the project through photos, music, text and film” and was distributed across Australian libraries.&lt;ref&gt;Sometimes, Beth et al: “Ngapartji Ngapartji; Indigenous Languages in the Arts”, in: Hobson, John et al: Re-Awakening Languages. Theory and Practice in the Revitalisation of Australia’s Indigenous Languages, Sydney: Sydney University Press, 2010. p.89&lt;/ref&gt;

The film ''Nothing Rhymes with Ngapartji''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.roninfilms.com.au/feature/4689/nothing-rhymes-with-ngapartji.html |title= Nothing Rhymes with Ngapartji |work=Ronon Films |year=2010 |accessdate=17 Jan 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; documents the staging of the theatre show in a creek bed in the remote Indigenous community of [[Ernabella]] (SA) in 2008, the negotiation of cultural protocols following the death of Arnold Jamieson and the personal repercussions for the creative team.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.abc.net.au/arts/stories/s3257394.htm |title=Nothing Rhymes with Ngapartji |work=ABC Arts Blog |date=30 Jun 2011 |accessdate=15 Jan 2013 |quote= The film follows the Ngapartji Ngapartji team's journey to Ernabella and performance of their acclaimed show. It is terrible timing for Trevor, whose father, a central character in the stage show, passed away only weeks before. Not only does Trevor have to confront his grief in order to deliver the performance, in doing so he has to grapple with the decision to risk breaking traditional law by saying his father's name, acting the part of him, and showing footage of him as part of the show. }}&lt;/ref&gt;

As mentioned above, the joint advocacy for a new national policy to [[Language revitalization|revitalise]] and maintain Indigenous languages across Australia eventually prompted the release of the Commonwealth Government’s strategy paper "Indigenous Languages – A National Approach" in August 2009 and the tabling of the [http://www.aph.gov.au/parliamentary_business/committees/house_of_representatives_committees?url=atsia/languages/report/index.htm House of Representatives Standing Committee Report into Indigenous Language Learning].&lt;ref&gt;Sometimes, Beth et al: “Ngapartji Ngapartji; Indigenous Languages in the Arts”, in: Hobson, John et al: Re-Awakening Languages. Theory and Practice in the Revitalisation of Australia’s Indigenous Languages, Sydney: Sydney University Press, 2010. p.87/88 |quote= Over the last three years the Ngapartji Ngapartji team have researched the status of language support in each state and put together a position paper on language policy. Every touring season politicians, advisors, language workers, academics, linguists and other influential people are invited to watch the show and encouraged to consider the importance of Indigenous languages.&lt;/ref&gt;

Another legacy of the project is the spin-off performance work ''Nyuntu Ngali'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.windmill.org.au/shows/current/nyuntu-ngali |title=Nyuntu Ngali |work=Windmill Theatre |year=2009 |accessdate=17 Jan 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; which was workshopped in [[Ernabella]] (SA) in early 2009 before completing seasons at the Adelaide Festival Theatre (Nov 2009), the Australian Performing Arts Market (Feb 2010) and the [[Sydney Theatre Company]] (May 2010).&lt;ref&gt;Palmer, Dave: Ngapartji Ngapartji: The Consequences of Kindness, Perth: Murdoch University, 2010. p. 44&lt;/ref&gt;

The creative team of ''Ngapartji Ngapartji'' was invited to Japan in early 2012 to attend the commemorations of the [[Fukushima Daiichi nuclear disaster|Fukushima disaster]] and to celebrate the publication of a Japanese translation of the script.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.canberratimes.com.au/entertainment/stage/memories-of-atomic-horror-20120713-21zel.html#ixzz2I04FlyPA |title= Memories of Atomic Horror |work=by Diana Streak for Canberra Times |date=Jul 14, 2012  |accessdate=15 Jan 2013 |quote= In March Rankin and Yumi Umiumare visited Japan on the anniversary of the catastrophic earthquake and tsunami that struck the Fukushima nuclear power plant in 2011. ''Trevor couldn't do it because he was touring Namatjira so Yumi and I took this story in a lecture-based outing as part of the anniversary of Fukushima. Some Japanese people are coming to the Canberra Theatre Centre to see it because they are very interested in the story with the potential of taking it back there. It's also an interesting tie-up given the twin city relationship between Canberra and Nara,'' he says. The new version is designed to travel. ''It will be in a shape that we can tour internationally if and as we want to. There is a special reason for doing it in Japan, there is a comradeship there and I think that would fit very well with where the material is after 10 years of working on it. }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Big ''h''ART’s [[Namatjira Project|''Namatjira'' project]] was also incepted during ''Ngapartji Ngapartji''’s lifetime as Elton Wirri (artist and project participant) provided the link to the [[Hermannsburg, Northern Territory|Hermannsburg]] community and helped promote [[Big hART|Big ''h''ART]] as a company of credence among elders.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.smh.com.au/news/arts/the-skill-of-namatjiras-grandson/2006/10/31/1162278141730.html |title=The Skill of Namatjira’s Grandson |work=by Emily Dunn for The Sydney Morning Herald |date=1 Nov 2006 |accessdate=19 Dec 2012 |quote=His work […] forms the backdrop for ''Ngapartji Ngapartji'', a performance at the Sydney Opera House which tells the story of the Spinifex or Pitjantjatjara tribe of Central Australia and their encounter with atomic testing at Maralinga in the 1950s. For ''Ngapartji Ngapartji'', one of Elton's watercolours was cut into small squares which are turned as the play progresses to reveal the landscape. }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A most important legacy of the project according to academic Dave Palmer was that people connected with their culture in a new way, building strong identities and asserting themselves flexibly and successfully in a multicultural context. The Pitjantjatjara concept of ‘ngapartji ngapartji’ itself provided the overarching framework for such a new form of intercultural engagement: glossed as ‘I give you something. You give me something’ it denotes a reciprocal exchange of gifts that create a social framework of mutual obligations. In contrast to Western ideas of trade, here the defining element of exchange is not the material value of the objects and services traded but the fact that trading itself establishes bonds that link people to each other – not only in a material way, but also socially, emotionally and spiritually. Consequently, it is deferral of immediate gratification that keeps people engaged and not a quid pro quo situation that is sought.&lt;ref&gt;Palmer, Dave: Ngapartji Ngapartji: The Consequences of Kindness, Perth: Murdoch University, 2010. p. 4-6&lt;/ref&gt;

“'''On the Cruelty of Really Teaching Computing Science'''” is a 1988 paper by [[Edsger W. Dijkstra|E. W. Dijkstra]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite EWD|1036|On the Cruelty of Really Teaching Computing Science}}&lt;/ref&gt; which argues that [[computer programming]] should be understood as a branch of [[mathematics]], and that the formal [[mathematical proof|provability]] of a [[computer program|program]] is a major criterion for correctness.

Despite the title, most of the article is on Dijkstra’s attempt to put [[computer science]] into a wider perspective within [[science]], teaching being addressed as a [[corollary]] at the end.
Specifically, Dijkstra made a “proposal for an introductory programming course for freshmen” that
consisted of [[Hoare logic]] as an uninterpreted [[formal system]].

== Debate over feasibility ==

Since the term "software engineering" was coined, [[formal verification]] has almost always been considered too resource-intensive to be feasible.  In complex applications, the difficulty of correctly specifying what the program should do in the first place is also a common source of error.  Other methods of [[software testing]] are generally employed to try to eliminate [[Software bug|bugs]] and many other factors are considered in the measurement of [[software quality]].

The notion that cost of production of hardware should be a constraint in programming was foreign to Dijkstra. He viewed the cost controls as artifacts that could become excuses and the controls of nature as nonexistent in [[digital electronics|digital system]]s, which above the level of circuits guarantee a second, constructed nature.{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}}

Until the end of his life, Dijkstra maintained that the central challenges of computing hadn’t been met to his satisfaction, due to an insufficient emphasis on [[program correctness]] (though not obviating other requirements, such as [[maintainability]] and [[algorithmic efficiency|efficiency]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite EWD|1304|The end of Computing Science?}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Pedagogical legacy ==

Computer science as taught today does not follow {{em | all}} of Dijkstra's advice.  The curricula generally emphasize techniques for managing complexity and preparing for future changes, following Dijkstra's earlier writings.  These include [[Abstraction (computer science)|abstraction]], [[programming by contract]], and [[Design pattern (computer science)|design patterns]].  Programming techniques to avoid bugs and conventional software testing methods are taught as basic requirements, and students are exposed to certain mathematical tools, but formal verification methods are not included in the curriculum except perhaps as an advanced topic.&lt;ref&gt;MIT Courses :

&lt;/ref&gt; So in some ways, Dijkstra's ideas have been adhered to; however, the ideas he felt most strongly about have not been.

Newly formed curricula in software engineering have adopted Dijkstra's recommendations.  The focus of these programs is the formal specification of software requirements and design in order to facilitate the formal validation of system correctness.  In Canada, they are often accredited engineering degrees with similar core competencies in physics-based engineering.&lt;ref&gt;[http://courses.utep.edu/portals/870/parnas_seisnotcs.pdf ''Software Engineering Programs Are Not Computer Science Programs'']&lt;/ref&gt;

There is also greater emphasis on the social aspects of programming, such as learning how to program as part of a team, and how to write code that is easily re-used by other people, or "borrowing" code from other programs' source code, which was not considered immoral or illegal at the time. Some institutions focus more on pleasing the computing industry by teaching the most popular programming languages, or teaching the use of commonly available development tools, than they do on imparting the foundational concepts of computing science.{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}}

'''Pre-service teacher education''' is the education and training provided to [[student teacher]]s before they have undertaken any teaching.

== Requirements for acceptance to pre-service programs ==
Before entering into a pre-service education program, most students will have obtained a previous [[academic degree]], either a general or honours, in a subject of their choice, (''e.g.'' English, math, science, religion). The alternative to this is that students may work simultaneously on an undergraduate bachelor's degree and a pre-service education program. The latter route incorporates education courses throughout the program's 4 or 5 years, and culminates in a final year of specific pre-service training. Students who complete a bachelor's degree before returning to a university to complete the pre-service education program are in a ''consecutive'' pre-service program, while students who complete their pre-service training at the same time as their undergraduate degree are in a ''concurrent" program.&lt;ref name="van nuland"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Van Nuland |first1=S. |title=Teacher education in Canada |journal=Journal of Education for Teaching |date=2011 |volume=37 |issue=4 |pages=409–421 |doi=10.1080/02607476.2011.611222}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

===Australia===
In Australia, pre-service teachers generally undergo an online course for qualification into pre-service teacher education. these courses are designed to enhance teachers' knowledge, skills and confidence.&lt;ref&gt;Australian Institution for Teaching and School Leadership. (2016).&lt;/ref&gt;

===United Kingdom===
In the United Kingdom, a teaching qualification in further education (TQFE) is offered at many universities and can be used as a qualification in pre-service teacher education.&lt;ref&gt;University of Stirling, postgraduate teacher education. 2016.&lt;/ref&gt;

===United States===
In the US, students are often required to take a test prior to acceptance into an accredited program, and/or upon graduation in order to earn certification.  Commonly, the [[praxis test|PRAXIS I or PRAXIS II]] are required for this purpose. Common topics include [[classroom management]], [[lesson plan]]s, and professional development. There are a number of places to study pre service teacher education in the US. The Michigan State University offers courses in elementary and secondary teacher preparation, as well as a master's degree in teaching and curriculum.&lt;ref&gt;Broad, K., Evans, M., Gambhir, R., &amp; Gaskell, J. (2008). Characterizing initial teacher education in Canada: Themes and issues. Ontario Institute for Studies in Education, University of Toronto. Michigan State University, Department of Teacher Education. (2016).&lt;/ref&gt;

== Foundational thinking on pre-service education programs ==
The practical nature of pre-service education training programs aligns with American philosopher [[John Dewey]]'s theory of experience.  In his book [[Experience and Education (book)|Experience and Education]] Dewey prescribes that learning must be based upon the actual life experiences of an individual that are interactive, experimental, and purposive in nature. [[Donald Schön|Donald Schon]] expanded upon Dewey's model by focusing further upon the importance of [[reflective practice]] in the learning process.  Schon was a proponent of using reflection in teacher education and other professions to guide learning through reflection on past experiences to guide future learning and practice, as evidenced in his 1996 work, Educating the reflective practitioner: Toward a new design for teaching and learning in the professions.&lt;ref&gt;Schon, D.A. (1996). ''Educating the reflective practitioner: Toward a new design for teaching and learning in the professions''. San Francisco: Jossey-Bass, Inc.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Major foci of pre-service teacher education program ==

Provincial and state territories across North America vary greatly in population, language, demographics, geography and other social factors. As such the universities and colleges that offer pre-service education recognize unique factors about the student populations they serve, and in response have created unique programs to meet those needs.&lt;ref name="van nuland" /&gt; That being said, there are two major components that are common to pre-service education programs.

=== Practicum ===
A major focus in the pre-service education program is the practicum - the pre-service teacher is placed within a school setting (either elementary, or senior) and shadows an experienced teacher. All faculties of education in Canada include a practicum component in their pre-service programs.&lt;ref&gt;Broad, K., Evans, M., Gambhir, M., &amp; Gaskell, J. (2008). Characterizing initial teacher education in Canada: Themes and issues. Ontario Institute for Studies in Education, University of Toronto.&lt;/ref&gt;  The pre-service teacher will be given opportunities to develop skills through observing their associate teacher, creating lesson plans, teaching lessons and experiential learning about classroom management.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Allen |first1=J. M. |last2=Wright |first2=S. E. |title=Integrating theory and practice in the pre-service teacher education practicum |journal=Teachers and Teaching |date=2014 |volume=20 |issue=2 |pages=136–151 |doi=10.1080/13540602.2013.848568}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Course work ===
To complement the practicum, pre-service programs offer academic based courses, designed to expose teacher candidates to collaborative inquiry, current research, educational philosophy, theory, pedagogy and practical resources to provide a foundation for their work as educators.&lt;ref&gt;Broad, K., Evans, M., Gambhir, M., &amp; Gaskell, J. (2008). Characterizing initial teacher education in Canada: Themes and issues. Ontario Institute for Studies in Education, University of Toronto.&lt;/ref&gt; This, combined with the experience gained through the practicum prepare the next generation of teachers for the challenges of the classroom.

== Pre-service graduate challenges ==
After completing a pre-service program, a graduate must apply for certification to be hired by a public school board. This is granted by a provincial or state governing authority.&lt;ref&gt;Ontario College of Teachers. (2014) Becoming a Teacher: Requirements. Retrieved from http://www.oct.ca/becoming-a-teacher/requirements&lt;/ref&gt; Not all pre-service programs are designed the same and a certificate obtained in one country may not be recognized in another.&lt;ref&gt;Ontario College of Teachers. (2014) Becoming a Teacher: Requirements. Retrieved from http://www.oct.ca/becoming-a-teacher/requirements&lt;/ref&gt;  Within the US, state-to-state reciprocity is limited.  In Canada jurisdictional requirements for teacher education differs provincially,&lt;ref name="van nuland" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ontario College of Teachers. (2014) Becoming a Teacher: Requirements. Retrieved from http://www.oct.ca/becoming-a-teacher/requirements&lt;/ref&gt; and each province has a designated authority responsible for the evaluation, certification and provision of teacher qualifications.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://resource.educationcanada.com/certification.html|title=Teaching Jobs in Canada|publisher=EducationCanada.com|accessdate=October 22, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is significantly more challenging to receive certification in a state or province other than that in which the teacher attended their pre-service program.&lt;ref&gt;Broad, K., Evans, M., Gambhir, M.,&amp; Gaskell, J. (2008). Characterizing initial teacher education in Canada: Themes and issues. Ontario Institute for Studies in Education, University of Toronto.&lt;/ref&gt; This makes it difficult for pre-service graduates to find employment outside of the state or province in which they received their training.

'''Southern Oregon University''' ('''SOU''') is a public [[liberal arts college]] located in [[Ashland, Oregon|Ashland]], [[Oregon]], [[United States]]. Founded in 1926, it was formerly known as Southern Oregon College and Southern Oregon State College. It offers programs in business, economics, criminology, natural sciences, including environmental science, [[William Shakespeare|Shakespearean]] studies and theatre arts programs. It is headquarters for [[Jefferson Public Radio]] and public access station [[Rogue Valley Television]]. Southern Oregon University is a member of the [[Council of Public Liberal Arts Colleges]].

==History==
Southern Oregon University began as '''Ashland Academy''' in 1872, founded in part by Reverend Henry Skidmore of Oregon's [[Methodist Episcopal Church]].&lt;ref name=Kreisman&gt;Kreisman, Authur. Remembering: A History of Southern Oregon University . Eugene, Ore.: [[University of Oregon Press]], 2002.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1878, the school was renamed '''Ashland College''', and then renamed '''Ashland College and Normal School''' in 1879. In 1887, the [[Government of Oregon|State of Oregon]] proclaimed the school an official state [[normal school]]. However, the state did not provide any funding for the school, and in 1890 the school closed.&lt;ref name=Kreisman/&gt; In 1892, the school selected a new site in the city with financial assistance from Methodists in [[Portland, Oregon|Portland]], and construction began on what was named the '''Ashland Collegiate Institute'''.&lt;ref name=Kreisman/&gt; The school reopened in 1895 as the '''Southern Oregon State Normal School''', and state funding began in 1899.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.move2ashland.com/ashland/history_of_ashland.htm History of Ashland] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110720140119/http://www.move2ashland.com/ashland/history_of_ashland.htm |date=2011-07-20 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Ashland Normal School manual training 1908.jpeg|thumb|left|300px|Students in the manual training program at Ashland Normal School in 1908.]]

In 1904, the school became a full state school, but funding was eliminated in 1909, leading to the closing of the campus.{{Citation needed|date=September 2008}} In 1926, the state reestablished Southern Oregon State Normal School in Ashland at a new location on land donated by the city, where the university is currently located.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ous.edu/about/chanoff/files/history.pdf Chronological History of the Institutions of the Oregon University System] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060906200605/http://www.ous.edu/about/chanoff/files/history.pdf |date=2006-09-06 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The residents of Ashland passed the "Normal School Site Bonds" to build the new facility. The building was later named Churchill Hall after the Normal School' president Churchill who oversaw the relocation project. Churchill now serves as Southern's administrative building, with the president's office on the first level. Churchill Hall closely resembles [[Eastern Oregon University]]'s Inlow Hall. Both buildings were built at during the same time from the same architecture semantics. The buildings were designed by architect [[John Bennes]] and retain their original [[Renaissance Revival Architecture|Renaissance style]].

In 1932, the [[Oregon State Board of Higher Education]] renamed the institute '''Southern Oregon Normal School'''. In 1939, the state board eliminated normal schools in Oregon. The university received full accreditation from the [[American Association of Teachers Colleges]]. With the accreditation, [[Governor of Oregon|Oregon Governor]] [[Charles A. Sprague]] signed into law the bill changing the institution's name to '''Southern Oregon College of Education'''.&lt;ref name=Kreisman/&gt; In 1956, the university underwent another name change, to '''Southern Oregon College''' to reflect the institute's diverse degree options. In 1975, it was renamed''' Southern Oregon State College'''. In 1979 Dr. Natale Sicuro became president and led the movement in 1997, it officially became Southern Oregon University.

In the spring of 2014 the faculty of Southern Oregon University held a vote of no confidence in President [[Mary Cullinan]], [[Provost (education)|Provost]] James Klein, and Vice President of Finance and Administration Craig Morris, citing a failure in leadership and fiscal mismanagement. 83% of the faculty participated in the vote, with 76% of those faculty expressing no confidence in Cullinan, 84% expressing no confidence in Klein, and 92% expressing no confidence in Morris. &lt;ref name="No Confidence"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://kobi5.com/news/item/professor-there-is-right-now-a-climate-of-fear-at-sou.html |title=Professor: 'There is right now a climate of fear at SOU' |date=2014-03-17 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140908000201/http://kobi5.com/news/item/professor-there-is-right-now-a-climate-of-fear-at-sou.html |archivedate=2014-09-08 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Cullinan and Klein subsequently left the University.

In 2014, Roy Saigo signed on as the university's interim president. He served until the end of 2015-16 school year.

==Academics==
Southern Oregon University consists of the College of Arts and Sciences, the School of Business, and the School of Education. In addition to the main campus, classes are offered on the university's satellite campus in downtown [[Medford, Oregon|Medford]]. The main campus is home to an Oregon Health Science University satellite campus, which maintains a school of nursing. An Honors College was inaugurated in 2013. 

The College of Arts and Sciences was formed in 2007 by combining the SOU School of Arts &amp; Letters, School of Sciences, and the School of Social Sciences.&lt;ref name="sou.edu"&gt;[http://www.sou.edu/CAS/ Southern Oregon University] Official website&lt;/ref&gt; In 2011, ''U.S. News &amp; World Report'' ranked Southern as the 71st best amongst the regional universities in the west.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Siemers|first=Erik|title=UofO 101st, OSU 138th in U.S. News rankings|url=http://www.bizjournals.com/portland/morning_call/2011/09/uofo-101st-osu-138th-in-us-news.html|accessdate=4 February 2012|newspaper=Portland Business Journal|date=September 14, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Rogue Community College and Southern Oregon University Higher Education Center==
Southern Oregon University and Rogue Community College worked together to implement the guidelines of the white paper "Annexation of Jackson County to the District of Rogue Community College," signed on March 6, 1996. During the 1997&amp;ndash;99 biennium, Rogue Community College and Southern Oregon University received regional partnership funding from the legislature to jointly launch several new initiatives to provide additional access for a larger number of residents in southern Oregon. Construction on the downtown Medford center broke ground March 2007 and was completed September 2008.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Darling|first=John|title=RCC-SOU Joint Project Breaks Mold|url=http://www.mailtribune.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20070321/NEWS/303219999&amp;cid=sitesearch|work=Medford Mail Tribune|publisher=Dow Jones Local Media Group|date=March 21, 2007|accessdate=March 3, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The three-story, {{convert|68700|sqft|m2|adj=on}} center includes classrooms, science labs, computer labs, a [[Prometric]] Testing Center and the Business Center. The Higher Education Center offers lower- and upper-division level courses, as well as three master's degree programs: Master in Business Administration (offered in a cohort format with classes held on Saturdays), Master in Management (courses offered online and at night), and the Master of Arts in Teaching (a two-year, part-time version of the Southern Oregon University one-year Master of Arts in Teaching program).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rcc-sou.org/ RCC/SOU Higher Education Center]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Hannon Library==
The library was named after Oregon state senator Lenn Hannon after he secured $20 million in government bonds and $3.5 million in private support. The ''Hannon Library'' finished construction in 2005. To show their support the board named initially named the library ''The Lenn and Dixie Hannon Library'' but was later changed to just ''Hannon Library''. The library almost doubled the size of the existing library and making much needed room for expanding publications. The library also had many technological advancements  that kept long term value for the community. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://hanlib.sou.edu/about/hannon.html|title=Lenn and Dixie Hannon - Hannon Library at Southern Oregon University|author=|date=|website=hanlib.sou.edu|accessdate=6 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Publications==
The ''Siskiyou'' a student edited university paper staffed by student reporters and photographers. It is published online each Wednesday during the academic year.

==Campus life==
Many of the majors offered at the university have associated clubs. There are clubs for hobbies, sports, and music, as well as continued support for multiculturalism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sou.edu/su/mrc/|title=Multicultural Resource Center|author=|date=|website=sou.edu|accessdate=6 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Southern Oregon University students are involved in community arts.  ''[[Outside (magazine)|Outside]]'' magazine rated Southern Oregon University 20th on a list of U.S. universities in 2003, based on recreational opportunities.&lt;ref name="outside"&gt;"[http://outsideonline.com/outside/features/200309/200309_college_towns_4.html Outside University] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100920034841/http://outsideonline.com/outside/features/200309/200309_college_towns_4.html |date=2010-09-20 }}". ''Outside''. Retrieved 2006-05-05.&lt;/ref&gt;

Student activities and support are supplemented by a number of resource centers on campus. [http://www.sou.edu/wrc/ The Women's Resource Center], Ecology Center of the Siskiyous, Commuter Resource Center,  and the Queer Resource Center all provide services, resources, and events to their respective communities. The university is represented on the Board of Directors of the [[Oregon Student Association]].

There are several [[dorm|Residence Halls]] on campus, as well as family housing complexes.
* The Greensprings Complex consists of four halls: Applegate, Bear Creek, Crater Lake, and Deschutes.
* The oldest residence hall on campus, Susanne Homes, was built in the 1940s. Susanne Homes (Suzy) is now the home to ROTC, The Honors College, CORE, and the Southern Oregon University McNair Program. Only ROTC students live in the building currently. The main area of the building called "the Fishbowl" is used by all four groups on a shared basis.
* The Madrone Apartment complex consists of Apartments, each of which contain four bedrooms, two bathrooms (one shower and either one bathtub or one [[Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990|ADA]] compliant shower), and one kitchen and living room area. The Madrone Apartments opened in September 2005.
* The newest residence halls on campus are Shasta Hall and McLoughlin Hall. There is also a  new dining hall, The Hawk. 
* The Old Mill Village is a complex of apartments specifically for students attending Southern Oregon University who have families. The university also has houses available to qualified students.
A new residence complex, the North Campus Village, began construction in the Spring of 2012 and opened in the Fall of 2013.

===Athletics===
{{main|Southern Oregon Raiders}}

Southern Oregon sports teams, known as the [[Southern Oregon Raiders|Raiders]], have the [[Red-tailed Hawk]] as a mascot. The Raiders are a member of the [[National Association of Intercollegiate Athletics|NAIA]], primarily competing in the [[Cascade Collegiate Conference]]. Men's sports include basketball, cross country, football, track &amp; field and wrestling; while women's sports include basketball, cross country, soccer, softball, track &amp; field and volleyball. Southern Oregon's football team competes in the [[Frontier Conference]], winning the NAIA championship in 2014, and its wrestling team competes as an Independent in the NAIA West Regional, winning the National Wrestling Championship four times: in 1978, 1983, 1994, and 2001.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.netitor.com/photos/schools/naia/sports/m-wrestl/auto_pdf/WRST_champ_history.pdf|title=NAIA Wrestling Championship History|author=|date=|website=netitor.com|accessdate=6 April 2018|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110714170133/http://www.netitor.com/photos/schools/naia/sports/m-wrestl/auto_pdf/WRST_champ_history.pdf|archivedate=14 July 2011|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Théodore Limperg jr.''' (Amsterdam, December 21, 1879&amp;nbsp;– Amsterdam, December 6, 1961) was a Dutch [[accountant]], and Professor in [[Business economics]] at the [[University of Amsterdam]]. He is particularly known for his contribution to the international debate about [[replacement cost]]s in the 1920s.&lt;ref&gt;[[Clarke, Frank L.]], and [[Graeme W. Dean]]. ''Contributions of Limperg and Schmidt to the Replacement Cost Debate in the 1920s.'' Garlan, 1990.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Biography ==
Théodore Limperg was born late 1879 as the son of Theodorus Limperg, chief administrative officer in Amsterdam, and Mathilda Speijer. Because his father's first name and his were almost alike, he called himself Th. Limperg jr. throughout his life. He graduated in 1897 at the Commercial High School, and in 1900 obtained a teaching licence in accounting. In the same year he started his training to become [[Chartered Accountant]] at the  Dutch Institute of Accountants (Nederlands Instituut van Accountants NIvA), predecessor of the Nederlands Instituut van Registeraccountants (NIVRA), and acquired his degree in 1904.

Limperg had started working as assistant accountant to gain practical experience. In 1901 he was admitted to the Netherlands Institute of Accountants, and joined the accountancy firm Volmer &amp; Co as member.&lt;ref&gt;A. van Seventer, " [http://clio.lib.olemiss.edu/cdm/ref/collection/aah/id/464 Limperg, Theodore Jr. (1879-1961)", in ''History of Accounting: An International Encyclopedia'', Garland Publishing, New York, 1996, p. 385.]&lt;/ref&gt; Some years later with his younger brother, who had become auditor, he founded the firm Th. and L. Limperg. This company merged in 1970 with Moret, De Jong &amp; Starke to Moret &amp; Limperg, which eventually merged into [[Ernst &amp; Young]]. In 1922 Limperg was appointed Professor of Business Economics at the Municipal University of Amsterdam, nowadays [[University of Amsterdam]]. He ended his work as practicing accountant at the firm Th. and L. Limperg. In addition to his professorship he served in various administrative and advisory positions.

During World War II within the Senate of the Municipal University of Amsterdam, he was one of the leading figures in the resistance against the Germans. He was dismissed from his post in April 1943 and was forced into hiding. His son, the architect Koen Limperg, belonged to the resistance group that organised the attack on the Amsterdam Resident registration office in 1943. He was later captured and executed 1 July 1943 in [[Overveen]].

After the [[Liberation Day (Netherlands)|Liberation]] Limperg took up his professorship again, and served another five years until his retirement in 1950.

Limperg married twice: In 1906 with Emma Altink (deceased in 1947), and in 1953 with Marguerite Isabelle Marie Goossens. He had three children. Besides Koen he had a son Theo, who was a lawyer and specialized in copyright law, and a daughter Emmy, first economics teacher and later lecturer in [[Wageningen University and Research Centre|Wageningen]].

== Work ==
Limpergs ideas on accountancy in general are considered of great significance for the development of accountancy and business economics in The Netherlands. However, he sparingly published. His collected works was largely compiled from college notes made by his disciples. Limperg's economic theories have become known through the writings of his students, especially through the work of Salomon Kleerekoper. Limperg has been named 'patriarch of the Dutch accountants.'&lt;ref&gt;Joost Ramaer. "Accountant Den Hartog moet het stuur blijven hanteren," in: ''Volkskrant,'' 19 januari 2002.&lt;/ref&gt; The cornerstone of his work was his theory about [[replacement value]].

=== Accountancy ===
Limperg wanted to bring the accountancy practice and theory on a higher level. He published a series of articles starting in 1905 in the newly established ''Accountancy'' journal about the future direction of the profession, and its requirements. Another focus was on the relationship between accountancy and society. Limperg argued, that auditor reports should not only be prepared for direct clients, but for anyone who wants to take notice.

In 1905 he became editor-in-chief at the ''Accountancy'' journal. In his articles he criticized the Nederlands Instituut van Accountants NIvA (Dutch Institute of Chartered Accountants), of which he was a member as well. The institute didn't take this for granted. When the board of the institute came into conflict with a fellow member, [[Johannes Gerardus Charles Volmer|J.G.Ch. Volmer]],&lt;ref&gt;[[Johannes Gerardus Charles Volmer]] (1865-1935), since 1909 Professor of Business Administration in Delft and in Rotterdam since 1914, was a colleague of Limperg for many years.&lt;/ref&gt; Limperg chose his side. In 1906 Limperg was disbarred by Niva-governance. Many other members followed his example and stepped down. In the same year these dissidents jointly founded the Nederlandsche Accountants-Vereeniging NAV (Dutch Accountants Institute).&lt;ref&gt;Van Baalen, Peter J., and Luchien Karsten. "[http://repub.eur.nl/pub/1817/ERS%202004%20099%20LIS.pdf The Social Shaping of the early Dutch Management Schools-Professions and the power of Abstraction]." (2004). p. 23&lt;/ref&gt;

In the years following Limperg would shape the organization a model accountancy organization. The  ''Accountancy'' journal became the prime magazine of the association. The Nederlandsche Accountants-Vereeniging upheld stringent entrance requirements, and conducted its own examinations. A disciplinary board supervised the conduct of its members. The Nederlandsche Accountants-Vereeniging eventually merged into the Nederlands Instituut van Accountants in 1919. With the merge the new methods, quality standards for membership and the disciplinary board, became standard practice.

In 1923 after a dispute with the publisher Limperg started a new monthly accountancy magazine, entitled ''Maandblad voor Accountancy en Bedrijfseconomie (MAB),'' which still exists nowadays.

=== Trade Education ===
Beside the accountancy profession, Limperg campaigned for quality improvement of the Dutch business education and trade education on an academic level in a separate university. In 1913 he got his way, when in Rotterdam the Netherlands School of Commerce was founded, which in 1973 became the [[Erasmus University Rotterdam]]. In 1921 in the [[University of Amsterdam]] a new Faculteit der Handelswetenschappen (Faculty of Trade science) got started, which would become the Faculty of Economics and Econometrics.

Limperg would bear his mark on the organization and growth of the new faculty. He proposed additional auditor training, which started in 1929, and proposed to change its name to Faculty of Economics, which was implemented in 1935.&lt;ref&gt;Since 1987 it is named Faculty of Economics and Econometrics&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Replacement value ===
In his days, buildings, machinery and inventories on the balance sheet were traditionally validated based on [[historical cost]]s; the costs  paid to produce or to purchase the item. Another, better picture of the value can be determined based on [[replacement cost]]s; the price one would pay to produce or to purchase the item. As a consequence, the assets of the company should be regularly reassessed. That provides a revaluation reserve, which is part of the equity.

This idea didn't originate from Limperg, but he did further develop the concept. His ideas had a decisive influence on the method of cost calculation and determination of profit in several Dutch companies, including [[Philips]].

The Dutch legislation offers a choice between valuation at historical cost or valuation at replacement cost. Even after the introduction of the [[International Financial Reporting Standards]] (IFRS) for listed companies that still applies. Under International Financial Reporting Standards, the company is required to pay for the replacement of the value to be taken. For equipment they may continue to use the replacement cost.

=== Notable students of Limperg ===
Some of the most noted students of Limperg.
* Abraham Mey (1890-1971), professor at the University of Amsterdam
* Salomon Kleerekoper (1893-1970), professor at the University of Amsterdam
* Henri Johan van der Schroeff (1900-1974), professor at the University of Amsterdam
* Jacob Louis Mey (1900-1966), professor at University of Groningen until 1964 and then Technische Universiteit Delft
* [[Jacobus Franciscus Haccoû]] (1903-1972), professor at the University of Amsterdam
* Louis Jacques Zimmerman (1913-1998), professor at the University of Amsterdam
* [[Joop Klant]] (1915-1994), professor at the University of Amsterdam, also a prose writer
* Gerard Leonard Groeneveld (1904-1989), professor at the Catholic University Tilburg, delivered the collected works of Limperg
Because many proponents of Limperg's theories taught at the [[University of Amsterdam]] (like Limperg himself), they are often called the "Amsterdam School" of accountancy.&lt;ref&gt;[[Mattessich, Richard. V.]] "[https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Richard_Mattessich/publication/229852212_Fritz_Schmidt_(18821950)_and_his_pioneering_work_of_current_value_accounting_in_comparison_to_Edwards_and_Bell's_theory*/links/0deec51e43bb47832c000000.pdf Fritz Schmidt (1882–1950) and his pioneering work of current value accounting in comparison to Edwards and Bell's theory*.]" Contemporary Accounting Research 2.2 (1986): p. 160.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Political views ===
Limperg can be seen in many ways as a [[social democrat]]. He didn't emphasize his political views too much, to uphold his position as scientist, but he was politically engaged. In November 1938 he co-authored with fourteen others (among them the later Minister of Finance [[Piet Lieftinck]]), an open letter to the government regarding the policy of public finance. The manifesto opposed the conservative politics promoted by the direct advisers to the government, and called for a more active economic policy. Limperg also espoused the Plan van de Arbeid (Labor Plan), a plan to combat the economical crisis, drawn up by [[Hein Vos]] and [[Jan Tinbergen]] in the early thirties.

After the Second World War Limperg took a seat in the Board of Trustees of the scientific department of the [[Nederlands Verbond van Vakverenigingen]] (Dutch Trade Union Confederation).

== Recognition ==
The work of Limperg received much acknowledgements. In 1935 he was appointed honorary president of the Comité International de l'Organisation Scientifique. The Netherlands School of Commerce (now Erasmus University Rotterdam) awarded him an honorary doctorate in 1947. In 1950 he received the [[Wallace Clark Medal]] for his international contribution to [[scientific management]].

The Dutch inter-university institute for accountancy bears his name: Limperg Institute. This institute, in which five universities and the Nederlandse Beroepsorganisatie van Accountants (NBA), the Dutch association of auditors, cooperate, coordinates the Dutch postgraduate accountancy courses. The Institute organizes the annual Limperg Day, where the Limperg Medal is awarded to an individual, who has made a significant contribution to scientific research in the fields of accounting and auditing.

The '''University of North Carolina academic-athletic scandal''' involved proven [[fraud]] and [[academic dishonesty]] committed at the [[University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill]] (UNC). It is one of the most notorious academic scandals in United States history.&lt;ref name="UNC Scandal"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cbssports.com/collegebasketball/eye-on-college-basketball/25205236/unc-scandal-allegations-responses-and-a-timeline-on-whats-to-come|title=UNC Scandal|date=June 4, 2014|publisher=www.cbssports.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; Following a [[University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill football scandal|lesser scandal that began in 2010]] involving academic fraud and improper benefits with the university's [[North Carolina Tar Heels football|football program]], two hundred questionable classes offered by the university's African and Afro-American Studies department (commonly known as AFAM) came to light. While initially the media focused more on the implications for the famous [[North Carolina Tar Heels men's basketball|UNC men's basketball program]], the entire university was placed on probation by its accrediting organization.

An internal investigation by the university released in 2011 and another investigation commissioned by former North Carolina governor [[James G. Martin|Jim Martin]] in 2012 found numerous academic and ethical issues with the AFAM department, including unauthorized grade changes and faculty signatures, a disproportionate number of [[independent study]] class offerings relative to other departments, and an over-representation of student-athletes enrolled in such classes. Then in 2014 began charges and counter-charges between university officials and former learning specialist Mary Willingham, including disputes about statistics and methods of analysis by Willingham alleging that certain student-athletes are not academically qualified for college.&lt;ref name=twsPaulBarrett/&gt;  As a result of these revelations, the [[Southern Association of Colleges and Schools]] placed the university on probation for one year, endangering the university's [[regional accreditation]]. Losing accreditation would have resulted in the loss of any federal funding or support. 

The university introduced new standards, protocols and rules to ensure nothing similar could ever happen again. As a result, UNC successfully exited probation and regained full standing by June 2016. The [[National Collegiate Athletic Association]] (NCAA) then completed its own investigation in October 2017, finding no violations of its rules, since the NCAA does not interfere with a university's academic programs. &lt;ref&gt;https://www.ncaa.org/sites/default/files/Oct2017_University-of-North-Carolina-at-Chapel-Hill_InfractionsDecision_20171013.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

The controversy sparked debate as to whether the university educated some of its student-athletes improperly and called into question the role of [[Division I (NCAA)|NCAA Division I]] athletics relative to the academic mission of NCAA-member colleges and universities.&lt;ref name=twsDanKane&gt;July 9, 2014, News Observer, Dan Kane, [http://www.newsobserver.com/2014/07/09/3995403/at-us-senate-hearing-ncaas-emmert.html?sp=/99/102/110/112/973/ At US Senate hearing, NCAA's Emmert pledges to work for change], Accessed July 15, 2014, "...With several United States senators at a hearing Wednesday questioning whether the NCAA and its member schools care about the well-being of college athletes...."&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==

===North Carolina football scandal===
{{main|University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill football scandal}}

Greg Barnes of Inside Carolina initially broke the scandal with ESPN following closely behind. On July 15, 2010, [[ESPN]] reported that the NCAA interviewed several North Carolina football players over alleged gifts, extra benefits, and sports agent involvement.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sports.espn.go.com/ncf/news/story?id=5384232|title=Sources: NCAA probing UNC football|publisher=ESPN|date=July 15, 2010|accessdate=June 30, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Reportedly, the investigation began after North Carolina defensive tackle [[Marvin Austin]] made a post on [[Twitter]] on May 29 that year, and the post contained a reference to a nightclub in [[Miami]] in which a sports agent's party had taken place two months earlier.&lt;ref name="UNC's Austin posted more than 2,400 Twitter updates"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Giglio|first1=J.P.|title=UNC's Austin posted more than 2,400 Twitter updates|url=http://www.newsobserver.com/2010/07/21/590713/austin-prolific-tweeter.html|website=Raleigh News &amp; Observer|accessdate=June 28, 2014|date=July 21, 2010|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140815173426/http://www.newsobserver.com/2010/07/21/590713/austin-prolific-tweeter.html|archive-date=August 15, 2014|dead-url=yes|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; The university later suspended Austin and over ten other football players from the team.&lt;ref name="Agent scandal costs UNC three players"&gt;{{cite web|title=Agent scandal costs UNC three players|url=http://sports.espn.go.com/ncf/news/story?id=5673405|publisher=ESPN|accessdate=June 28, 2014|date=October 11, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Shaun Draughn returns"&gt;{{cite web|author=Associated Press|url=http://sports.espn.go.com/ncf/news/story?id=5567679|title=Shaun Draughn returns to UNC lineup|work=ESPN.com|date=September 13, 2010|accessdate=June 30, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; On October 11, 2010, Austin was expelled from the football team, and the NCAA declared wide receiver [[Greg Little (American football)|Greg Little]] and defensive end [[Robert Quinn (American football)|Robert Quinn]] "permanently ineligible" due to receiving improper benefits.&lt;ref name="Agent scandal costs UNC three players"/&gt;

On August 26, 2010, the NCAA began a separate investigation of North Carolina football that involved possible academic fraud involving a tutor in the university's academic support program. The tutor was later identified as Jennifer Wiley ({{as of|2013|lc=y}} known as Jennifer Wiley Thompson due to marriage).&lt;ref name="Tutor too close to athletes"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Former UNC tutor connected to football scandal charged with violating NC sports agent laws"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Blythe|first1=Anne|title=Former UNC tutor connected to football scandal charged with violating NC sports agent laws|url=http://www.newsobserver.com/2013/10/03/3250242/former-unc-tutor-connected-to.html|website=News &amp; Observer|accessdate=June 30, 2014|date=October 3, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another source familiar with the investigation said that Wiley was accused of "inappropriate help on papers that football players were required to write for classes."&lt;ref name="Tutor too close to athletes"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.newsobserver.com/2010/09/24/699742/tutor-too-close-to-athletes.html|title=Tutor too close to athletes|author1=Pickeral, Robbi|author2=Curliss, J.

==Academic irregularities and punishment==
The crux of the alleged irregularities proceeded from the UNC Department of African and Afro-American Studies. Over approximately fifteen years, the department offered two hundred [[independent study]] courses, many without full adherence to University procedure for course provisioning or sufficient professorial oversight.  The irregularities called into question the Department's academic integrity and led to the [[Southern Association of Colleges and Schools]] putting the university on academic probation for one year, an almost unprecedented step against a major research university.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.cbssports.com/college-football/news/unc-academic-scandal-leaves-university-in-peril-beyond-athletics/&lt;/ref&gt;

===Overview===
[[File:Bloomberg Businessweek UNC cover.jpg|thumb|right|The March 3, 2014 ''[[Bloomberg BusinessWeek]]'' magazine had a cover story by Paul M. Barrett alleging academic improprieties by the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill regarding student-athletes.]]
A basic charge by critics was that UNC did not live up to its end of the bargain by not sufficiently educating some of its student-athletes.&lt;ref name=twsPaulBarrett&gt;{{cite web|author=Barrett, Paul M.|title=In Fake Classes Scandal, UNC Fails Its Athletes—and Whistle-Blower|url=http://www.businessweek.com/printer/articles/186365-in-fake-classes-scandal-unc-fails-its-athletes-and-whistle-blower|work=Bloomberg Businessweek|date=March 3, 2014|accessdate=July 15, 2014|quote=...rather than educating its recruited athletes, UNC was playing a shell game...}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rebecca Schuman of ''[[Slate (magazine)|Slate.com]]'' accused the university of "abjectly failing some of its students" by keeping them "functionally illiterate."&lt;ref name=twsRebeccaSchuman&gt;{{cite web|author=Schuman, Rebecca|work=Slate|url=http://www.slate.com/articles/life/education/2014/01/mary_willingham_north_carolina_scandal_use_unemployed_ph_d_s_to_teach_athletes.html|title=Postdocs for Jocks: The latest UNC scandal reminds us that schools don't care about whether their athletes can read.

Gerald Gurney, president of the [[Drake Group|Drake Group for Academic Integrity in College Sport]], called UNC "the mother of all academic fraud violations" because of "cooperation of friendly faculty and [a] [[cover-up]]."&lt;ref name=twsCNN2/&gt; Paul M. Barrett, in a cover story for the March 3, 2014 ''[[Bloomberg Businessweek]]'' magazine, wrote: "...rather than seriously investigate the connection between sports and classroom corruption, top university administrators used vague committee reports to obfuscate the issue."&lt;ref name=twsPaulBarrett/&gt;

&lt;ref name=twsNYTimes2/&gt; Reporter [[Dan Kane]] of the ''[[News &amp; Observer]]'' was part of a three-person investigative team which exposed the scandal, despite substantial resistance by the university, according to a subsequent report in the ''[[New York Times]]''.&lt;ref name=twsNYTimes2&gt;{{cite web|author=Lyall, Sarah|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2014/04/27/sports/reporter-digging-into-scandal-hits-a-universitys-raw-nerve.html|title=Reporter Digging Into Scandal Hits a University's Raw Nerve: University of North Carolina Is at Odds With a Raleigh Newspaper|date=April 27, 2014|accessdate=July 15, 2014|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140501055726/http://www.nytimes.com/2014/04/27/sports/reporter-digging-into-scandal-hits-a-universitys-raw-nerve.html|archivedate=May 1, 2014|deadurl=no|quote=...Kane ... member of a three-person investigative team ... helped unearth, often against serious university resistance, many of the most shocking examples of malfeasance....}}&lt;/ref&gt; Kane has been criticized by detractors for leading a "wrongheaded effort" to link college sports with academic improprieties; college administrators "no longer take his calls", and some faculty describe his efforts as a witch hunt for a conspiracy that does not exist.&lt;ref name=twsNYTimes2/&gt;

===Initial accusations===
Suspicions about the UNC Department of African and Afro-American Studies were raised as early as 2011. UNC defensive end [[Michael McAdoo]] filed a lawsuit against the NCAA on July 1, 2011 seeking reinstatement to the football team.&lt;ref name="McAdoo to put NCAA to test as he seeks injuction to end ineligibility"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Staples|first1=Andy|title=McAdoo to put NCAA to test as he seeks injuction to end ineligibility|url=https://www.si.com/more-sports/2011/07/06/mcadoo-lawsuit|website=SI.com|accessdate=June 30, 2014|date=July 6, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The NCAA declared McAdoo ineligible for accepting improper benefits and committing academic fraud, based on the UNC Undergraduate Honor Court finding that McAdoo committed academic dishonesty by having Jennifer Wiley complete a bibliography and works-cited section on a research paper for an AFAM class.&lt;ref name="McAdoo to put NCAA to test as he seeks injuction to end ineligibility"/&gt; From this lawsuit, McAdoo was forced to make public the paper; an analysis by Dan Kane of the Raleigh ''News &amp; Observer'' found that the Honor Court failed to find multiple instances of plagiarism in McAdoo's paper.&lt;ref name="UNC honor court failed to find McAdoo's obvious plagiarism"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Kane|first1=Dan|title=UNC honor court failed to find McAdoo's obvious plagiarism|url=http://www.newsobserver.com/2011/07/17/1349691/mcadoo-paper-case-looks-bad-for.html|website=News &amp; Observer|accessdate=June 30, 2014|date=July 17, 2011|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121012175018/http://www.newsobserver.com/2011/07/17/1349691/mcadoo-paper-case-looks-bad-for.html|archive-date=October 12, 2012|dead-url=yes|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; On July 13, a North Carolina Superior Court judge in [[Durham, North Carolina|Durham]] refused to grant an injunction against the NCAA, thus upholding ineligibility for McAdoo.&lt;ref name="UNC honor court failed to find McAdoo's obvious plagiarism"/&gt;

Then in August, Dan Kane reported that football player [[Marvin Austin]] took a 400-level course in the department the summer before his freshman fall semester. According to an academic adviser at the university, "it is unusual for any freshman to begin his or her college education with a 400 level course."&lt;ref name="Austin's UNC transcript raises questions"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Kane|first1=Dan|title=Austin's UNC transcript raises questions|url=http://www.newsobserver.com/news/local/education/unc-scandal/article10349711.html|website=The News &amp; Observer|accessdate=April 28, 2016|date=August 23, 2011|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110929093234/http://www.newsobserver.com/2011/08/21/1425946/uncs-austin-got-unusual-start.html?storylink=MI_emailed|archivedate=September 29, 2011|deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt; On September 1, 2011, just over a week after Kane's article about Austin's transcript was published, AFAM department chair Julius Nyang'oro resigned from his executive position but remained on faculty.&lt;ref name="UNC professor resigns academic chairman post"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Kane|first1=Dan|title=UNC professor resigns academic chairman post|url=http://www.newsobserver.com/2011/09/02/1454391/unc-professor-resigns-academic.html|website=News &amp; Observer|accessdate=June 30, 2014|date=September 2, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

More controversy for AFAM came after the transcript of former North Carolina football and basketball player [[Julius Peppers]] was found under a University of North Carolina web address (www.unc.edu) by members of ''PackPride'', a [[Scout.com]] community for fans of rival school [[NC State Wolfpack|NC State]].&lt;ref name="Peppers' transcript might point to broader academic issues at UNC"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Kane|first1=Dan|title=Peppers' transcript might point to broader academic issues at UNC|url=http://www.newsobserver.com/2012/08/13/2266292/transcript-in-unc-probe-may-be.html|website=The News &amp; Observer|accessdate=August 13, 2014|date=August 13, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="How Julius Peppers' transcript was exposed"&gt;{{cite web|title=How Julius Peppers' transcript was exposed|url=http://www.newsobserver.com/2012/08/31/2304496/how-julius-peppers-transcript.html|website=The News &amp; Observer|accessdate=August 13, 2014|date=August 31, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; A university staffer originally posted the transcript with Peppers's identifying information removed on a secure UNC server as a test record in 2001.

[[File:James G. Martin at Johnson AFB, Dec 29, 1988.JPEG|thumb|right|Former North Carolina governor Jim Martin commissioned a 2012 report that reviewed irregularities in the UNC Department of African and Afro-American Studies.]]

On May 2, 2012, UNC released the results of an internal investigation into AFAM courses commissioned by Jonathan Hartlyn, senior associate dean for social sciences and global programs, and William L. Andrews, senior associate dean for fine arts and humanities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author1=Hartlyn, Jonathan, and Andrews, William L.|title=Review of courses in the Department of African and Afro-American Studies, College of Arts and Sciences|url=http://www.unc.edu/news/12/1.pdf|publisher=University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill|accessdate=July 30, 2014|date=May 2, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The report examined AFAM classes from the summer 2007 to summer 2011 sessions.&lt;ref name="Report finds academic fraud evidence in UNC department"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Kane|first1=Dan|title=Report finds academic fraud evidence in UNC department|url=http://www.newsobserver.com/2012/05/04/2044178/report-finds-academic-fraud-evidence.html|website=The News &amp; Observer|accessdate=July 30, 2014|date=May 4, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Among the findings in the Hartlyn-Andrews report:
*Nearly 40 percent of students enrolled in questionable AFAM classes were football and basketball players.&lt;ref name="UNC players made up 39 percent of suspect classes"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Kane|first1=Dan|title=UNC players made up 39 percent of suspect classes|url=http://www.newsobserver.com/2012/05/07/2050241/unc-football-basketball-players.html|website=News &amp; Observer|accessdate=June 30, 2014|date=May 7, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
*However, there was no evidence showing that student-athletes who took AFAM classes got preferential treatment.&lt;ref name="Report finds academic fraud evidence in UNC department"/&gt;
*AFAM administrator Deborah Crowder likely oversaw scheduling and grade rosters of questionable classes.&lt;ref name="Report finds academic fraud evidence in UNC department"/&gt;
*Nearly nine classes lacked evidence that a professor taught course material and graded work. For one [[Swahili language|Swahili]] class, the syllabus listed AFAM chair Julius Nyang'oro as professor, but Nyang'oro told university investigators that he did not teach that class. For 40 other courses listing Nyang'oro as instructor, mostly during summer sessions, a professor was present during class but seldom taught.&lt;ref name="Report finds academic fraud evidence in UNC department"/&gt;

===Martin Report (2012)===
On December 19, 2012, UNC released a report, commissioned by former North Carolina governor [[James G. Martin|Jim Martin]], in collaboration with accounting firm [[Baker Tilly Virchow Krause, LLP]]. The report examined data back to the 1990s. Among its findings:
*Student-athletes were disproportionately enrolled in suspect classes.&lt;ref name=twsPaulBarrett/&gt; 
*From the 1990s through 2011, AFAM offered two hundred lecture courses that never took place, as well as offering dubious independent study programs that required little work to complete.&lt;ref name=twsPaulBarrett/&gt;&lt;ref name=twsCNN2/&gt;&lt;ref name=twsRonMorris&gt;{{cite web|author=Morris, Ron|url=http://www.thestate.com/2014/06/16/3512712/morris-uncs-alleged-academic-fraud.html|title=UNC's alleged academic fraud just the tip of the iceberg|work=The State|publisher=McClatchy|place=Columbia, S.C.|date=June 16, 2014|accessdate=July 15, 2014|quote=The academic scandal that has tainted the University of North Carolina athletics department is disgusting, despicable and altogether not surprising.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Also, some professors never showed up to teach classes.&lt;ref name=twsDudash&gt;{{cite web|author=Dudash, April|title=UNC responds to report condemning student-athletes' reading levels|

* In "dozens of instances", eight professors "were unwittingly and indirectly compromised" when their signatures were forged by others on grade rosters.

There were felony fraud charges brought against Nyang'oro for being paid $12,000 to teach a non-existent class, but these charges were dropped by the [[Orange County, North Carolina|Orange County]] district attorney based on recommendations from Kenneth Wainstein in exchange for Nyang'oro's cooperation.&lt;ref name=twsCNN2&gt;Sara Ganim, CNN, July 3, 2014, [http://www.cnn.com/2014/07/03/us/university-of-north-carolina-paper-classes-case/ Charges dropped in University of North Carolina 'paper classes' case], Accessed July 15, 2014, "...ex-professor Julius Nyang'oro would no longer be facing a felony fraud charge..."&lt;/ref&gt;

In early 2014, Willingham went to national media to express her concerns about the university. In interviews with [[Sara Ganim]] of [[CNN]] in January and Paul M. Barrett of ''[[Bloomberg Businessweek]]'' in March, Willingham alleged:
*Students accessed a team-maintained computer hard drive which contained a database of previous papers, and submitted recycled documents with cosmetic changes.&lt;ref name=twsPaulBarrett/&gt;
* Some student-athletes reading below college levels. In an interview with [[CNN]], Willingham claimed that 60% of 183 UNC football and basketball players, which she analyzed from 2004 to 2012, were reading at fourth- to eighth-grade levels, and that 10% read below a third-grade level.&lt;ref name=twsNewsObserver/&gt;
* She steered academically disadvantaged student-athletes towards enrolling in sham AFAM lecture courses.&lt;ref name=twsPaulBarrett/&gt;&lt;ref name=twsCNN2/&gt;
* The university was playing a "shell game" to prevent student-athletes from having to do any serious studying.&lt;ref name=twsPaulBarrett/&gt;

In response to Willingham's claims about student-athlete literacy, UNC released another report by a board of educational experts outside the university that examined data between 2004 and 2012. That report found that there were 341 men's and women's basketball players and football players during these years; of this group, 34 students did not meet CNN's threshold of being "college literate", which meant a minimum [[SAT]] reading score of 400 or an [[ACT (test)|ACT]] score of 16; essentially, the university suggested that of its athletes, ten percent had academic issues.&lt;ref name=twsDailyTarheel1/&gt; This is in contrast with the allegation by Mary Willingham, based on her personal investigations, that 60% of college athletes were not "college literate".&lt;ref name=twsDailyTarheel1/&gt; In another of her analyses, she found that 150 to 200 of 400 student-athletes were "underperforming", some "badly underperforming", with the last group being mostly made of men's and women's players of basketball and football.&lt;ref name=twsPaulBarrett/&gt; One view suggested that the university's response to these and other allegations was to try to change the focus away from wrongdoing, in part by challenging Willingham's assertions and research.&lt;ref name=twsBusinessWeek&gt;{{cite news|last1=Barrett|first1=Paul M.|title=UNC Fake-Classes Whistleblower Resigns After Meeting With Chancellor|url=http://www.businessweek.com/articles/2014-04-22/mary-willingham-the-fake-classes-whistleblower-at-university-of-north-carolina-resigns-after-meeting-with-chancellor|accessdate=1 July 2014|work=Bloomberg|date=April 22, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The review board disputed her findings on the grounds that her methodology was not appropriate.&lt;ref name=twsDailyTarheel1&gt;[http://www.dailytarheel.com/article/2014/04/unc-releases-outside-review-of-mary-willinghams-research BREAKING: UNC releases outside review of Mary Willingham's research], Accessed July 15, 2014, "...&lt;/ref&gt;

A series of emails released on 11/29/2015 containing 20,000+ pages of communications, including emails between Mary Willingham and other UNC staff members, seem to lend credence to the review board's refutation of Willinghams's methodology. Willingham never provided the methodology she used to come to her conclusions. Notwithstanding the fact that there is no methodology for combining multiple tests to determine grade levels, however there was one person who could completely confirm Willingham's findings. Lyn Johnson was the psychologist who administered and scored the tests in question and aggregated the data for the UNC academic support program.  In a January 16, 2014 email exchange between Johnson and Willingham, Johnson asks Willingham to explain her conclusions, stating "Where did you get the 60% reading below 8th grade level?"  Willingham didn't explain how, and that Johnson had to ask confirms Willingham didn't obtain her conclusions from Johnson.  This strongly supports the review board's findings that Willinghams's methodology was not appropriate.&lt;ref name="Coaching The Mind"&gt;[https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B3OnDyFpkUlMWDctQUJ5LWozY1k/view], Released November 29, 2015, "...&lt;/ref&gt;

The report was a general look at how some top NCAA Division I schools hire learning specialists like Willingham to help keep student-athletes eligible.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.newsobserver.com/2014/03/24/3729368/hbos-real-sports-looks-at-academic.html|title=HBO's 'Real Sports' looks at academic programs for UNC student-athletes|author=Cain, Brooke|work=Happiness Is a Warm TV|publisher=newsobserver.com|date=March 24, 2014|accessdate=July 26, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; A representative for UNC stated in response that HBO reported on "information that has previously been reported and discussed."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://uncnews.unc.edu/2014/03/25/shell/|title=University response to HBO Real Sports segment|publisher=University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill|accessdate=July 26, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A segment by [[ESPN]]'s ''[[Outside the Lines]]'' from March 25, 2014&lt;ref&gt;3:00 mark of video "[http://espn.go.com/video/clip?id=10671809 UNC Academic Scandal: Whistleblower, Former Athlete Speak Out ]"&lt;/ref&gt; drew attention because Willingham showed a 146-word essay about [[Rosa Parks]] and claimed that an unnamed student-athlete at UNC earned an A-minus in an AFAM class for turning that essay in. However, according to ''[[Slate.com]]'', the paper shown by Willingham "was most likely a draft of one piece of a take-home final for a legitimate introductory course."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.slate.com/blogs/moneybox/2014/04/03/the_146_word_essay_that_got_a_unc_jock_an_a_here_s_the_real_story.html|title=That Horrible Essay That Got a UNC Jock an A-?

In August 2014, citing posts in the [[Scout.com]] UNC message board ''Inside Carolina'', Dan Kane reported in ''The News &amp; Observer'' that passages in Willingham's 2009 master's thesis appeared to be plagiarized.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Kane, Dan|url=http://www.newsobserver.com/2014/08/04/4050924/unc-critic-accused-of-plagiarism.html|title=UNC critic Mary Willingham accused of plagiarism in thesis|work=The News &amp; Observer|date=August 4, 2014|accessdate=August 6, 2014|quote=...several examples in which her wording either mirrors or closely resembles other sources... cites sources but doesn't put their information in quotes ... not cite the source...}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Accusations by Rashad McCants===
[[File:Rep. Tony Cardenas and Rashad McCants.jpg|thumb|right|[[Rashad McCants]], a member of the North Carolina basketball team that won the [[2005 NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Tournament|2005 NCAA championship]], received national attention for claiming to have had a substandard education at North Carolina. He met with Representative [[Tony Cárdenas]] (left) to discuss NCAA reform issues.]]

{{Quote|When you get to college, you don't go to class, you don't do nothing, you just show up and play ... That's exactly how it was, you know, and I think that was the tradition of college basketball, or college, period, any sport.

{{quote|The question is what are we talking about, honestly. I mean I have a check being written to me from the University of North Carolina for over '''$10 million''' due to the exploitation of me as a player and the lack of education that I received.

On June 6, 2014, the [[ESPN]] program ''[[Outside the Lines]]'' broadcast an interview with [[Rashad McCants]], who was a starter on the [[2004–05 North Carolina Tar Heels men's basketball team|North Carolina basketball team]] that won the [[2005 NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Tournament|2005 NCAA championship]], in which McCants claimed to have taken phony classes and had tutors write his classwork.&lt;ref name=twsRonMorris/&gt;&lt;ref name="McCants OTL"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Delsohn|first1=Steve|title=UNC's McCants: 'Just show up, play'|url=http://espn.go.com/espn/otl/story/_/id/11036924/former-north-carolina-basketball-star-rashad-mccants-says-took-sham-classes|publisher=ESPN|accessdate=July 23, 2014|date=June 6, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, all sixteen other members of the 2005 team released a statement which disputed McCants's account.&lt;ref name="McCants OTL"/&gt; Additionally, coach [[Roy Williams (coach)|Roy Williams]], separately interviewed by the same program, disputed McCants's claims.&lt;ref name="Williams OTL"&gt;{{cite web|title=Williams: McCants doesn't ring true|url=http://espn.go.com/espn/otl/story/_/id/11047963/north-carolina-coach-roy-williams-disbelief-rashad-mccants-claims-academic-fraud|publisher=ESPN|accessdate=July 23, 2014|date=June 8, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In contrast, in a noted 2004 interview with television station [[WRAL-TV|WRAL]], McCants compared attending UNC with being in jail.&lt;ref name="McCants jail comment"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Parsons|first1=Keith|title=McCants: 'I love North Carolina'|url=http://www.cstv.com/sports/m-baskbl/stories/101904abb.html|publisher=Associated Press|accessdate=July 30, 2014|date=October 19, 2004}} Original AP wire title: "McCants Says He Likes Being at Carolina"&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wralsportsfan.com/rs/story/1090689/|title=McCants Compares UNC Basketball To Job, Prison|publisher=WRAL-TV|date=October 19, 2004|accessdate=July 30, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Interviewed again on ''Outside the Lines'' on June 11, McCants stood by his claims about his academic experience at North Carolina. He also called on his fellow members of the 2004–05 basketball team to release their university transcripts because, in his opinion, "the truth is there in the transcripts" regarding bogus classes.&lt;ref name="McCants 6-11"&gt;{{cite web|title=McCants: 'All I know is the truth'|url=http://espn.go.com/espn/otl/story/_/id/11068696/rashad-mccants-holding-firm-allegations-unc-coach-roy-williams|publisher=ESPN|accessdate=July 23, 2014|date=June 11, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

University officials contacted McCants via mail and text message in the days following ESPN's initial interview with McCants, because McCants expressed "knowledge of potential NCAA rule violations involving the University of North Carolina," according to a letter signed by the athletics director of compliance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=UNC reaches out to McCants|url=http://www.newsobserver.com/2014/07/07/3990087/unc-reaches-out-to-mccants.html|website=News &amp; Observer|accessdate=July 23, 2014|date=July 7, 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140710030516/http://www.newsobserver.com/2014/07/07/3990087/unc-reaches-out-to-mccants.html|archive-date=July 10, 2014|dead-url=yes|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, McCants had not responded as of July 7, nor had he discussed his claims with the NCAA, according to the [[Associated Press]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=UNC asks McCants to meet over academic allegations|url=http://collegebasketball.ap.org/article/unc-asks-mccants-meet-over-academic-allegations|publisher=Associated Press|accessdate=July 23, 2014|date=July 7, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Actions by the university==

[[File:Ken Wainstein.jpg|thumb|right|Former U.S. Department of Justice official [[Kenneth L. Wainstein]] commissioned an independent investigative report of the UNC AFAM department.]]

=== Reforms ===
Some reforms have been instituted. These included better governance standards, more accountability for support programs for student-athletes, new department structures, and more classroom audits and oversight of courses, according to a university source.&lt;ref name="twsUSAToday1" /&gt; Employees called ''checkers'' were sent to classes to see whether, in fact, they were being held, as part of an improved auditing system.&lt;ref name="twsDudash" /&gt; Further, university officials made statements which affirmed that they were proud of the accomplishments of their sports programs and varsity teams.&lt;ref name="twsDudash" /&gt; An athletics director spoke highly of the university's scholarship program; one said most of their student-athletes graduate and have successful careers.&lt;ref name="twsDudash" /&gt; Some officials criticized the allegations; for example, a basketball coach objected that the allegations had slandered the "moral character of his players."&lt;ref name="twsPaulBarrett" /&gt;

==Conclusion==
[[File:2005 NCAA North Carolina v Michigan State.JPG|thumb|right|350px|North Carolina versus Michigan State basketball game.]]

Committee on Infractions head for the NCAA, [[Greg Sankey]], stated "While student-athletes likely benefited from the so-called 'paper courses' offered by North Carolina, the information available in the record did not establish that the courses were solely created, offered and maintained as an orchestrated effort to benefit student-athletes."&lt;ref name="NYT Fin"/&gt; North Carolina chancellor [[Carol Folt]] commented on the resolution of the case when she said "I believe we have done everything possible to correct and move beyond the past academic irregularities and have established very robust processes to prevent them from recurring."&lt;ref name="NYT Fin"/&gt; Tyrone P. Thomas, a lawyer for Mintz Levin and does work with colleges and universities, felt the ruling was "... a massive loophole, and from the P.R. side it looks horrible — these athletes can do what they do, and it looks horrible. But guess what? Maybe that's not the N.C.A.A.'s job. This is something the schools have always self-regulated." &lt;ref name="NYT Fin"/&gt;

The '''Victorian Curriculum and Assessment Authority''' (VCAA) is a statutory authority of the [[Government of Victoria]] responsible for the provision of curriculum and assessment programs for students in [[Victoria, Australia]]. The VCAA is primarily accountable to the [[Minister for Education_(Victoria)|Victorian Minister for Education]]. It is also responsible to the Minister for Training and Skills and the Minister for Families and Children in relation to sections of Part 2.5 of the ''Education and Training Reform Act 2006''.

The mission of the VCAA is to provide high quality curriculum, assessment and reporting that enables individual lifelong learning. 

The VCAA is responsible for the Victorian Early Learning and Development Framework (VELDF) and the Victorian Curriculum. The Victorian Curriculum F–10 sets out a single, coherent and comprehensive set of content descriptions and associated achievement standards to enable teachers to plan, monitor, assess and report on the learning achievement of every student. The Victorian Curriculum F–10 incorporates and reflects much of the Australian Curriculum F–10, but differs in some important respects, most notably the representation of the curriculum as a continuum of learning and the structural design. Victorian Government and Catholic schools are required to use the Victorian Curriculum F–10. Independent schools may use the Victorian Curriculum F–10 as a model and resource for the effective implementation of the Australian Curriculum.

The VCAA has taken a leading role in expanding delivery of the Victorian curriculum internationally. The framework to support this includes a northern hemisphere timetable. In 2015-16, more than 1400 students participated in VCAA assessment programs with 25 overseas providers and in 2015, 460 students completed the [[Victorian Certificate of Education|Victorian Certificate of Education (VCE)]] with offshore providers.

At the senior secondary level, the VCAA provides curriculum and assessment for the VCE and the [[Victorian Certificate of Applied Learning|Victorian Certificate of Applied Learning (VCAL)]].

In 2015 VCAA issued 258,472 VCE study scores to 76,320 students. There were 49,460 VCE completions and 13,257 VCAL certificate completions.

The VCAA also administers the [[National Assessment Program – Literacy and Numeracy|National Assessment Program – Literacy and Numeracy (NAPLAN)]] which provides an indication of the [[literacy]] and [[numeracy]] skills of students. Students in Victoria undertake the testing in Years 3, 5, 7 and 9.

The VCAA showcases excellence in student work through the VCE Season of Excellence, an annual festival of works created by VCE students in technology, design, multimedia and the cinematic, visual and performing arts. It also recognises student achievement through the VCE Leadership Awards, Plain English Speaking Awards, VCAL Achievement Awards and Margaret Schofield Memorial Scholarships.

In a Year 12 VCE English examination in 2011 the VCAA instructed over 40,000 students to analyse a supposedly made-up blog that they in fact plagiarised from an opinion piece written by [[Helen Razer]] which was published in Melbourne-based newspaper ''[[The Age]]'' in 2010. Some of the comments written on the original article's webpage were also plagiarised.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.theage.com.au/national/education/sloppy-copy-in-exam-raises-ire-20111109-1n7eo.html | location=Melbourne | work=The Age | title=Sloppy copy in exam raises ire | date=2011-11-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; The VCAA apologised for this error and strengthened its practices to ensure that examination setting panels complied with copyright requirements in future.

In 2012 the VCAA caused further controversy when they published a digitally altered depiction of the painting ''Storming of the Winter Palace'' by Nikolai Kochergin in a history examination, which formed part of an image analysis question on the [[Russian Revolution]]. The altered painting depicted a [[BattleTech]] Marauder II robot participating in the storming along with the [[Bolsheviks]] in 1917.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.theage.com.au/victoria/vce-scores-changed-over-battle-tech-marauder-confusion-20130208-2e2qn.html "VCE scores changed over Battle Tech Marauder confusion."] ''The Age''. Retrieved 5 October 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; A VCAA spokesperson stated that the image was sourced from the internet, and that 5.5 percent of students had their scores adjusted due to the robot's presence. VCAA subsequently instituted a policy to ensure that future content would only be obtained from original source websites, rather than aggregator sites.

In 2016, a computer error allowed for 2075 students (approximately 2.5% of VCE candidates) to receive their ATAR score and VCE results five days earlier than they were supposed to be announced. External SMS provider for VCAA and VTAC, Salmat Digital, created an error that allowed for students to receive their results by texting VCAA and requesting their scores to be sent to them on the expected release date. This sparked outrage from parents of students who did not receive their scores, citing that they considered it "unfair".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Rania Spooner, Henrietta Cook, Bianca Hall and Timna Jacks|title=Fear and worry as VCE results are issued days early|url=http://www.theage.com.au/national/secondary-education-victoria/vce-2016-year-12-students-getting-atar-results-days-early-20161207-gt6dsl.html|website=The Age|accessdate=26 December 2016|date=8 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The VCAA and VTAC acted quickly to contact affected students and their schools to reassure them regarding the accidental early results release. The release of the remaining 97.5% of results took place without further issue at the planned time.

By tradition the Weriyeng school was founded on the island of [[Pulap]], which is today in the [[Pattiw]] region of [[Chuuk State]], [[Federated States of Micronesia]].

[[Mau Piailug]] is one of the most famous navigators of this school.

On 26 September 2018, Julian Assange stepped down as editor-in-chief of WikiLeaks.{{citation needed|date=October 2018}}

===Purpose===
According to the WikiLeaks website, its goal is "to bring important news and information to the public ... One of our most important activities is to publish original source material alongside our news stories so readers and historians alike can see evidence of the truth." Another of the organisation's goals is to ensure that journalists and [[whistleblower]]s are not prosecuted for emailing sensitive or classified documents. The online "drop box" is described by the WikiLeaks website as "an innovative, secure and anonymous way for sources to leak information to [WikiLeaks] journalists".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://epic.org/foia/epic_v_doj_fbi_wikileaks.html |publisher=[[Electronic Privacy Information Center]] |title=EPIC v.

Some describe WikiLeaks as a media or journalistic organisation. For example, in a 2013 resolution, the [[International Federation of Journalists]], a trade union of journalists, called WikiLeaks a "new breed of media organisation" that "offers important opportunities for media organisations".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.alliance.org.au/global-journalists-union-supports-wikileaks |title=Global journalists' union supports Wikileaks |publisher=Alliance.org.au |date=16 July 2013 |access-date=2 March 2014 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131231025031/http://www.alliance.org.au/global-journalists-union-supports-wikileaks |archivedate=31 December 2013 |deadurl=yes |df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Harvard University|Harvard]] professor [[Yochai Benkler]] praised WikiLeaks as a new form of journalistic enterprise,&lt;ref&gt;David Dishneau, [https://www.usnews.com/news/us/articles/2013/07/10/harvard-prof-is-star-witness-at-wikileaks-trial Harvard prof is star witness at WikiLeaks trial], Associated Press (13 July 2016).&lt;/ref&gt; testifying at the court-martial of Chelsea Manning (then Bradley Manning) that "WikiLeaks did serve a particular journalistic function," and that the "range of the journalist's privilege" is "a hard line to draw".&lt;ref&gt;Rainey Reitman, [https://freedom.press/blog/2016/04/transcript-yochai-benkler-testifies-bradley-manning-trial Transcript: Yochai Benkler Testifies at Bradley Manning Trial], Freedom of the Press Foundation (10 July 2013).&lt;/ref&gt; Others do not consider WikiLeaks to be journalistic in nature. Media ethicist Kelly McBride of the [[Poynter Institute for Media Studies]] wrote in 2011: "WikiLeaks might grow into a journalist endeavor. But it's not there yet."&lt;ref name="McBridge"&gt;Kelly McBridge, "What Is WikiLeaks? That's the Wrong Question" in ''Page One: Inside the New York Times and the Future of Journalism'' (ed. [[David Folkenflik]]: PublicAffairs, 2011).&lt;/ref&gt; [[Bill Keller]] of ''The New York Times'' considers WikiLeaks to be a "complicated source" rather than a journalistic partner.&lt;ref name="McBridge" /&gt; Prominent [[First Amendment]] lawyer [[Floyd Abrams]] writes that WikiLeaks is not a journalistic group, but instead "an organization of political activists; ... a source for journalists; and ... a conduit of leaked information to the press and the public".&lt;ref name="Abrams"&gt;[[Floyd Abrams]], ''Friend of the Court: On the Front Lines with the First Amendment'' (Yale University Press, 2013), p. 390.&lt;/ref&gt; Noting Assange's statements that he and his colleagues read only a small fraction of information before deciding to publish it, Abrams writes: "No journalistic entity I have ever heard of—none—simply releases to the world an elephantine amount of material it has not read."&lt;ref name="Abrams" /&gt;

==Administration==
According to a January 2010 interview, the WikiLeaks team then consisted of five people working full-time and about 800 people who worked occasionally, none of whom were compensated.&lt;ref name="leakonomy"/&gt; WikiLeaks does not have any official headquarters.

Until August 2010, WikiLeaks was hosted by [[PRQ]], a Sweden-based company providing "highly secure, no-questions-asked hosting services".

He talks about the [[Constitution of Sweden|Swedish constitution]], which gives the information–providers total legal protection.&lt;ref name="DN1" /&gt; It is forbidden, according to Swedish law, for any administrative authority to make inquiries about the sources of any type of newspaper.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Därför blir Julian Assange kolumnist i Aftonbladet |language=Swedish |author=Helin, Jan |newspaper=[[Aftonbladet]] (blog) |place=Stockholm |date=14 August 2010 |url=http://blogg.aftonbladet.se/janhelin/2010/08/darfor-blir-julian-assange-kolumnist-i-aftonbladet |access-date=15 August 2010 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120820032744/http://blogg.aftonbladet.se/janhelin/2010/08/darfor-blir-julian-assange-kolumnist-i-aftonbladet |archivedate=20 August 2012 |deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt; These laws, and the hosting by PRQ, make it difficult for any authority to eliminate WikiLeaks; they place an onus of proof upon any complainant whose suit would circumscribe WikiLeaks' liberty, e.g. its rights to exercise free speech online. Furthermore, "WikiLeaks maintains its own servers at undisclosed locations, keeps no logs and uses military-grade [[encryption]] to protect sources and other confidential information." Such arrangements have been called "[[bulletproof hosting]]".&lt;ref name="goodwin"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.blogs.cnn.com/2010/07/25/what-is-wikileaks/?iref=storysearch |title=What is WikiLeaks? |work=This Just In (CNN blog) |date=25 July 2010 |access-date=6 August 2010 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140114095005/http://news.blogs.cnn.com/2010/07/25/what-is-wikileaks/?iref=storysearch |archivedate=14 January 2014 |deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For example, our terms of service state that 'you represent and warrant that you own or otherwise control all of the rights to the content ... that use of the content you supply does not violate this policy and will not cause injury to any person or entity.'

WikiLeaks used [[EveryDNS]], but was dropped by the company after distributed denial-of-service ([[DDoS]]) attacks against WikiLeaks hurt the quality of service for its other customers. Supporters of WikiLeaks waged verbal and DDoS attacks on EveryDNS. Because of a typographical error in blogs mistaking EveryDNS for competitor ''[[EasyDNS]]'', the sizeable Internet backlash hit EasyDNS. Despite that, EasyDNS (upon request of a customer who was setting up new WikiLeaks hosting) began providing WikiLeaks with DNS service on "two 'battle hardened' servers" to protect the quality of service for its other customers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Canadian firm caught up in Wiki wars |first=Steve |last=Ladurantaye |url=https://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/technology/canadian-firm-caught-up-in-wiki-wars/article1830732/ |newspaper=The Globe and Mail |place=Toronto |date=8 December 2010 |access-date=9 December 2010 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110727052959/http://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/technology/canadian-firm-caught-up-in-wiki-wars/article1830732/ |archivedate=27 July 2011 |deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

WikiLeaks restructured its process for contributions after its first document leaks did not gain much attention.

However, WikiLeaks established an editorial policy that accepted only documents that were "of political, diplomatic, historical or ethical interest" (and excluded "material that is already publicly available").&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://wikileaks.org/wiki/Wikileaks:Submissions |title=WikiLeaks' submissions page |publisher=WikiLeaks |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080419013425/https://wikileaks.org/wiki/Wikileaks%3ASubmissions |archivedate=19 April 2008 |deadurl=yes|access-date=17 June 2010 |df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; This coincided with early criticism that having no editorial policy would drive out good material with spam and promote "automated or indiscriminate publication of confidential records".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://fas.org/blogs/secrecy/2007/01/wikileaks_and_untraceable_docu/ |title=Wikileaks and untraceable document disclosure |author=Aftergood, Steven |date=3 January 2007 |work=Secrecy News|access-date=21 August 2008 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130311214041/https://fas.org/blog/secrecy/2007/01/wikileaks_and_untraceable_docu.html |archivedate=11 March 2013 |deadurl=no |publisher=Federation of American Scientists}}&lt;/ref&gt; The original FAQ is no longer in effect, and no one can post or edit documents on WikiLeaks.

In Australia, the government and the [[Australian Federal Police]] have not stated what Australian laws may have been violated by WikiLeaks, but then Prime Minister [[Julia Gillard]] has stated that the foundation of WikiLeaks and the stealing of classified documents from the United States administration is illegal in foreign countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite interview |title=Gillard refines verdict on Assange |first=Julia |last=Gillard |date=7 December 2010 |url=http://www.abc.net.au/worldtoday/content/2010/s3086783.htm |interviewer=Lyndal Curtis |work=[[The World Today (Australian radio program)|The World Today]] |publisher=[[Australian Broadcasting Corporation|ABC Radio]] (Australia) |access-date=12 December 2010 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140209143804/http://www.abc.net.au/worldtoday/content/2010/s3086783.htm |archivedate=9 February 2014 |deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt; Gillard later clarified her statement as referring to "the original theft of the material by a junior U.S. serviceman rather than any action by Mr Assange."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Patricia |last=Karvelas |title=Party revolt growing over Prime Minister Julia Gillard's WikiLeaks stance |newspaper=[[The Australian]] |place=Sydney |date=14 December 2010 |url=http://www.news.com.au/features/wikileaks/party-revolt-at-pms-wiki-stance/story-fn79cf6x-1225970594165 |access-date=14 December 2010 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130731185654/http://www.news.com.au/features/wikileaks/party-revolt-at-pms-wiki-stance/story-fn79cf6x-1225970594165 |archivedate=31 July 2013 |deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt; Spencer Zifcak, president of Liberty Victoria, an Australian civil liberties group, notes that without a charge or a trial completed, it is inappropriate to state that WikiLeaks is guilty of illegal activities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite interview |subject=Robinson, Jennifer |subject2=Zifcak, Spencer |subject3=Saul, Ben |title=Law experts say WikiLeaks in the clear |quote=There is no charge and there has been no trial and even given all of those things the Prime Minister had the confidence to say that Mr Assange was guilty of illegality.

===Use of leaked documents in court===

In a [[Supreme Court of the United Kingdom|UK Supreme Court]] judgement given on 8 February 2018, the court unanimously decided that a document leaked through WikiLeaks "could be admitted into evidence".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bailii.org/uk/cases/UKSC/2018/3.html|title=R (on the application of Bancoult No 3) (Appellant) v Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs (Respondent)|publisher=United Kingdom Supreme Court|date=2018-02-08|accessdate=2018-09-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="brickcourt.co.uk"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.brickcourt.co.uk/news/detail/supreme-court-admits-wikileaks-documents-about-chagos-islanders-into-evidence|title=Supreme Court considers important test of Vienna Convention in relation to Wikileaks documents|publisher=Brick Court Chambers|date=2018-02-12|accessdate=2018-09-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The appeal that led to this ruling centred on a US government cable provided by [[Chelsea Manning]] and published by WikiLeaks. The [[Chagos islanders]] argued that the document showed the UK's motive for setting up a marine park on their territory was improper, but it had been excluded from proceedings earlier in the case.&lt;ref name="rt.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.rt.com/uk/418330-wikileaks-cables-supreme-court-chagos/|title=Leaked US documents can be used as evidence, rules UK Supreme Court|publisher=Russia Today|date=2018-02-09|accessdate=2018-09-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In an "important test of Vienna Convention in relation to Wikileaks documents" The Court ruled that "the cable should have been admitted into evidence before the Administrative Court", addressing the main issue. During this decision, the leaked document was said to not meet the criteria necessary to help the Chagos Refugee Group [[Expulsion of the Chagossians|recover their homeland]].&lt;ref name="brickcourt.co.uk"/&gt;&lt;ref name="rt.com"/&gt;

==Financing==
WikiLeaks is a self-described [[not-for-profit organisation]], funded largely by volunteers, and it is dependent on public donations. Its main financing methods include conventional [[Wire transfer|bank transfers]] and [[E-commerce payment system|online payment systems]]. According to Assange, WikiLeaks' lawyers often work pro bono. Assange has said that in some cases legal aid has been donated by media organisations such as the [[Associated Press]], the ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'', and the [[National Newspaper Publishers Association]].&lt;ref name="leakonomy" /&gt; Assange said in 2010 that WikiLeaks' only revenue consists of donations, but it has considered other options including auctioning early access to documents.&lt;ref name="leakonomy" /&gt; During September 2011, WikiLeaks began auctioning items on [[eBay]] to raise funds, and Assange told an audience at Sydney's Festival of Dangerous Ideas that the organisation might not be able to survive.{{citation needed|date=April 2016}}

On 24 December 2009, WikiLeaks announced that it was experiencing a shortage of funds{{citation needed|date=October 2017}}&lt;!-- WP:RS needed; removed link to WP:SPS (Twitter, FB, WP)--&gt; and suspended all access to its website except for a form to submit new material.&lt;ref name="digdeep"/&gt; Material that was previously published was no longer available, although some could still be accessed on unofficial [[mirror website]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=WikiLeaks&amp;nbsp;– Mirrors |url=http://wikileaks.ch/Mirrors.html |publisher=WikiLeaks |access-date=18 December 2010 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5ulmvdkVL?url=http://wikileaks.ch/mirrors.html |archivedate=6 December 2010 |deadurl=yes |df=dmy}}&lt;/ref&gt; WikiLeaks stated on its website that it would resume full operation once the operational costs were paid.&lt;ref name="digdeep"&gt;{{cite news |last=Butselaar |first=Emily |url=https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/libertycentral/2010/jan/29/wikileaks-shut-down |title=Dig deep for WikiLeaks |work=The Guardian |date=29 January 2010 |access-date =30 January 2010 |place=London |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110827012108/http://www.guardian.co.uk/commentisfree/libertycentral/2010/jan/29/wikileaks-shut-down |archivedate=27 August 2011 |deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt; WikiLeaks saw this as a kind of work stoppage "to ensure that everyone who is involved stops normal work and actually spends time raising revenue".&lt;ref name="leakonomy"&gt;{{cite news |title=Leak-o-nomy: The Economy of Wikileaks (Interview with Julian Assange) |author=Mey, Stefan |url=http://stefanmey.wordpress.com/2010/01/04/leak-o-nomy-the-economy-of-wikileaks/ |access-date=19 December 2010 |work=Medien-Ökonomie-Blog |date=4 January 2010 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101213110334/http://stefanmey.wordpress.com/2010/01/04/leak-o-nomy-the-economy-of-wikileaks/ |archivedate=13 December 2010 |deadurl=yes |df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; While the organisation initially planned for funds to be secured by 6 January 2010,{{citation needed|date=October 2017}}&lt;!-- WP:RS needed; removed link to WP:SPS (Twitter, FB, WP)--&gt; it was not until 3 February 2010 that WikiLeaks announced that its minimum fundraising goal had been achieved.{{citation needed|date=October 2017}}&lt;!-- WP:RS needed; removed link to WP:SPS (Twitter, FB, WP)--&gt;

The [[Wau Holland Foundation]] helps to process donations to WikiLeaks. In July 2010, the Foundation stated that WikiLeaks was not receiving any money for personnel costs, only for hardware, travelling and bandwidth.&lt;ref name="techeye"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.techeye.net/internet/wau-holland-foundation-sheds-light-on-wikileaks-donations |title=Wau Holland Foundation sheds light on WikiLeaks donations&amp;nbsp;– Hardware, ISP, travelling costs |publisher=TechEye.net |date=13 July 2010 |access-date=1 August 2010 |author=Daly, John W. |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110727011201/http://www.techeye.net/internet/wau-holland-foundation-sheds-light-on-wikileaks-donations#ixzz0td0dXhBx |archivedate=27 July 2011 |deadurl=yes |df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; An article in [[TechEye]] stated: 

{{quote|As a charity accountable under German law, donations for WikiLeaks can be made to the foundation.

However, in December 2010 the [[Wau Holland Foundation]] stated that 4 permanent employees, including Julian Assange, had begun to receive salaries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://m.thelocal.de/sci-tech/20101223-31975.html |work=The Local |place=Berlin |title=Wikileaks donations still flowing, but not to Assange legal fund |access-date=23 December 2010 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131002143644/http://m.thelocal.de/sci-tech/20101223-31975.html |archivedate=2 October 2013 |deadurl=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2010, Assange said the organisation was registered as a library in Australia, a foundation in France, and a newspaper in Sweden, and that it also used two United States-based non-profit [[501c3]] organisations for funding purposes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424052748704554104575436231926853198 |title=How WikiLeaks Keeps Its Funding Secret |date=23 August 2015|access-date=3 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 22 January 2010, the Internet payment intermediary [[PayPal]] suspended WikiLeaks' donation account and froze its assets. WikiLeaks said that this had happened before, and was done for "no obvious reason".{{citation needed|date=October 2017}}&lt;!-- WP:RS needed; removed link to WP:SPS (Twitter, FB, WP)--&gt; The account was restored on 25 January 2010.{{citation needed|date=October 2017}}&lt;!-- WP:RS needed; removed link to WP:SPS (Twitter, FB, WP)--&gt; On 18 May 2010, WikiLeaks announced that its website and archive were operational again.{{citation needed|date=October 2017}}&lt;!-- WP:RS needed; removed link to WP:SPS (Twitter, FB, WP)--&gt;

In June 2010, WikiLeaks was a finalist for a grant of more than half a million dollars from the [[John S. and James L.

Lee]], who has done PR work for WikiLeaks with the press and on social networking websites.&lt;ref name="Cook" /&gt;

During 2010, WikiLeaks received €635,772.73 in PayPal donations, less €30,000 in PayPal fees, and €695,925.46 in bank transfers. €500,988.89 of the sum was received in the month of December, primarily as bank transfers as PayPal suspended payments 4 December. €298,057.38 of the remainder was received in April.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://cryptome.org/0003/wl-finance-en.pdf |title="Project 04: Enduring freedom of information" Preliminary transparency report 2010 |publisher=Wau-Holland-Stiftung (WHS) ''via'' [[Cryptome]] |date=26 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Wau Holland Foundation]], one of the WikiLeaks' main funding channels, stated that they received more than €900,000 in public donations between October 2009 and December 2010, of which €370,000 has been passed on to WikiLeaks. Hendrik Fulda, vice-president of the Wau Holland Foundation, mentioned that the Foundation had been receiving twice as many donations through [[PayPal]] as through normal banks, before PayPal's decision to suspend WikiLeaks' account. He also noted that every new WikiLeaks publication brought "a wave of support", and that donations were strongest in the weeks after WikiLeaks started publishing leaked diplomatic cables.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Donations Were Never as Strong as Now |work=Spiegel International |place=Hamburg |date=13 December 2010 |url=http://www.spiegel.de/international/world/0,1518,734318,00.html |access-date=15 December 2010 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110715205752/http://www.spiegel.de/international/world/0%2C1518%2C734318%2C00.html |archivedate=15 July 2011 |deadurl=no |df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Financing WikiLeaks |first=Scott |last=Horton |newspaper=Harper's Magazine |place=New York |date=6 August 2010 |url=http://www.harpers.org/archive/2010/08/hbc-90007485 |access-date=15 December 2010 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121019211817/http://harpers.org/archive/2010/08/hbc-90007485 |archivedate=19 October 2012 |deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Icelandic judiciary decided that [[Valitor]] (a company related to [[Visa Inc.|Visa]] and [[MasterCard]]) was violating the law when it prevented donation to the site by credit card.

==Authenticity==
WikiLeaks has contended that it has never released a misattributed document and that documents are assessed before release. In response to concerns about the possibility of misleading or fraudulent leaks, WikiLeaks has stated that misleading leaks "are already well-placed in the mainstream media.

In July 2016, the [[Aspen Institute]]'s Homeland Security Group, a bipartisan counterterrorism organisation, warned that hackers who stole authentic data might "salt the files they release with plausible forgeries."&lt;ref name="Zorn"/&gt; Russian intelligence agencies have frequently used [[disinformation]] tactics, "which means carefully faked emails might be included in the WikiLeaks dumps.

The ''Guardian'' wrote that WikiLeaks, along with individuals and groups on the hard right, had been involved in the "ruthless exploitation of [Rich's] death for political purposes".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/media/2017/aug/07/seth-rich-trump-white-house-fox-news |title=The strange case of Fox News, Trump and the death of young Democrat Seth Rich |last=Pilkington |first=Ed |date=7 August 2017 |work=The Guardian|access-date=26 October 2017 |issn=0261-3077}}&lt;/ref&gt; The executive director of the [[Sunlight Foundation]], an organization that advocates for open government, was critical of WikiLeaks' fueling of conspiracy theories surrounding the [[murder of Seth Rich]]: "If they feel like they have a link to the staffer's death, they should say it and be responsible about it.

===Democratic Party and Hillary Clinton===
WikiLeaks has popularized [[Conspiracy theory|conspiracies]] about the Democratic Party and Hillary Clinton, such as tweeting an article which suggested Clinton campaign chairperson John Podesta engaged in satanic rituals (which was later revealed to be false),&lt;ref name=":23" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":10"&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://www.vox.com/world/2016/11/8/13563750/wikileaks-2016-election-statement |title=WikiLeaks just tried to justify its behavior this year in a bizarre Election Day statement |last=Beauchamp |first=Zack |newspaper=Vox|access-date=8 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":22"&gt;{{Cite news |url=http://www.snopes.com/john-podesta-spirit-cooking/ |title=FALSE: Clinton Campaign Chairman John Podesta Involved in Satanic 'Spirit Cooking' |last=Evon |first=Dan |newspaper=snopes|access-date=8 November 2016 |language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; implying that the Democratic Party had [[Murder of Seth Rich|Seth Rich]] killed,&lt;ref name=":24" /&gt; suggesting that Clinton wore earpieces to debates and interviews,&lt;ref name=":25"&gt;{{Cite news |url=http://thehill.com/blogs/ballot-box/presidential-races/295116-wikileaks-piles-on-to-clinton-earpiece-conspiracy |title=WikiLeaks piles on to Clinton earpiece conspiracy |last=Firozi |first=Paulina |date=8 September 2016 |newspaper=TheHill|access-date=8 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; claiming that Hillary Clinton wanted to drone strike Assange,&lt;ref name=":26"&gt;{{Cite news |url=http://www.snopes.com/julian-assange-drone-strike/ |title=To Silence Wikileaks, Hillary Clinton Proposed Drone Strike on Julian Assange? |last=LaCapria |first=Kim |newspaper=snopes|access-date=8 November 2016 |language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; promoting conspiracy theories about Clinton's health,&lt;ref name="bloomberg" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":27"&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2016/08/25/wikileaks-plays-doctor-gives-hillary-clinton-fake-disease.html |title=WikiLeaks Plays Doctor, Gives Hillary Clinton Fake Disease |last=Collins |first=Ben |date=25 August 2016 |website=The Daily Beast|access-date=29 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":28"&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/wikileaks-conspiracy-theory-hillary-clinton_us_57d6f4b2e4b00642712ebbd0 |title=WikiLeaks Feeds Conspiracy Theories That Hillary Clinton Has Parkinson's Or Head Injury Complications |last=Reporter |first=Dana Liebelson Staff |last2=Post |first2=The Huffington |date=12 September 2016 |website=HuffPost|access-date=29 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; and promoting a conspiracy theory from a Donald Trump–related Internet community tying the Clinton campaign to child kidnapper [[Laura Silsby]].&lt;ref name=":29"&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2016/11/03/wikileaks-latest-find-is-a-conspiracy-theory-from-trump-s-subreddit.html |title=WikiLeaks' Latest 'Find' Is a Conspiracy Theory From Trump's Subreddit |last=Collins |first=Ben |date=4 November 2016 |website=The Daily Beast|access-date=10 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Controversy==

===Allegations of anti-Americanism===
Short of simply disclosing information in the public interest, WikiLeaks has been accused of purposely targeting certain states and people, and presenting its disclosures in misleading and conspiratorial ways to harm those people.&lt;ref name=":10" /&gt; Writing in 2012, ''Foreign Policy''&lt;nowiki/&gt;'s Joshua Keating noted that "nearly all its major operations have targeted the U.S. government or American corporations."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://foreignpolicy.com/2012/08/16/how-wikileaks-blew-it/ |title=How WikiLeaks Blew It |website=Foreign Policy|access-date=8 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a 2017 speech addressing the [[Center for Strategic and International Studies]], CIA Director [[Mike Pompeo]] referred to WikiLeaks as "a non-state hostile intelligence service" and described founder Julian Assange as a narcissist, fraud, and coward.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.cia.gov/news-information/speeches-testimony/2017-speeches-testimony/pompeo-delivers-remarks-at-csis.html |title=Director Pompeo Delivers Remarks at CSIS — Central Intelligence Agency |website=www.cia.gov}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Allegations of anti-Clinton and pro-Trump bias ===
Assange wrote on WikiLeaks in February 2016: "I have had years of experience in dealing with Hillary Clinton and have read thousands of her cables. Hillary lacks judgement and will push the United States into endless, stupid wars which spread terrorism. ... &amp;nbsp;she certainly should not become president of the United States."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://observer.com/2016/06/why-julian-assange-doesnt-want-hillary-clinton-to-be-president/ |title=Why Julian Assange Doesn't Want Hillary Clinton to Be President |work=[[The Observer]] |date=24 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In July 2017, during an interview by [[Amy Goodman]], Julian Assange said that choosing between [[Hillary Clinton]] and [[Donald Trump]] is like choosing between [[cholera]] or [[gonorrhea]]. "Personally, I would prefer neither."&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.politico.com/story/2016/07/julian-assange-us-election-2016-226281 Assange: 2016 election is like choosing between 'cholera or gonorrhea']". ''[[Politico]].'' 27 July 2016.&lt;/ref&gt; WikiLeaks editor, [[Sarah Harrison (journalist)|Sarah Harrison]], has stated that the site is not choosing which damaging publications to release, rather releasing information that is available to them.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2016-10-11/how-julian-assange-turned-wikileaks-into-trump-s-best-friend |title=How Julian Assange Turned WikiLeaks Into Trump's Best Friend |newspaper=Bloomberg.com|access-date=27 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In conversations that were leaked in February 2018, WikiLeaks expressed a preference for a Republican victory in the 2016 election.&lt;ref name=":46" /&gt;

Having released information that exposed the inner working of a broad range of organisations and politicians, WikiLeaks started by 2016 to focus almost exclusively on Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton.&lt;ref name=":39"&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://foreignpolicy.com/2017/08/17/wikileaks-turned-down-leaks-on-russian-government-during-u-s-presidential-campaign/ |title=WikiLeaks Turned Down Leaks on Russian Government During U.S. Presidential Campaign |website=Foreign Policy|access-date=17 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the [[United States presidential election, 2016|2016 US presidential election]], WikiLeaks only exposed material damaging to the Democratic National Committee and Hillary Clinton. WikiLeaks even rejected the opportunity to publish unrelated leaks, because it dedicated all its resources to Hillary Clinton and the Democratic Party. According to ''The New York Times'', WikiLeaks timed one of its large leaks so that it would happen on the eve of the Democratic Convention.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2016/07/27/us/politics/assange-timed-wikileaks-release-of-democratic-emails-to-harm-hillary-clinton.html |title=Assange, Avowed Foe of Clinton, Timed Email Release for Democratic Convention |last=Savage |first=Charlie |date=26 July 2016 |work=The New York Times|access-date=23 October 2017 |issn=0362-4331}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ''Washington Post'' noted that the leaks came at an important sensitive moment in the Clinton campaign, as she was preparing to announce her vice-presidential pick and unite the party behind her.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/post-politics/wp/2016/07/22/on-eve-of-democratic-convention-wikileaks-releases-thousands-of-documents-about-clinton-the-campaign-and-internal-deliberations/ |title=WikiLeaks releases thousands of documents about Clinton and internal deliberations |last=Hamburger |first=Tom |date=22 July 2016 |work=The Washington Post|access-date=23 October 2017 |last2=Tumulty |first2=Karen |issn=0190-8286}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Sunlight Foundation]], an organisation that advocates for open government, said that such actions meant that WikiLeaks was no longer striving to be transparent but rather sought to achieve political goals: "It's become something else. It's not striving for objectivity. It's more careless. When they publish information it appears to be in service of some specific goal, of retribution, at the expense of the individual."&lt;ref name=":40" /&gt;

WikiLeaks explained its actions in a 2017 statement to ''[[Foreign Policy]]'': "WikiLeaks schedules publications to maximize readership and reader engagement. During distracting media events such as the Olympics or a high profile election, unrelated publications are sometimes delayed until the distraction passes but never are rejected for this reason."&lt;ref name=":39" /&gt; On 7 October 2016, an hour after the media had begun to dedicate wall-to-wall coverage of the revelation that Trump had bragged on video about sexually harassing women, WikiLeaks began to release emails hacked from the personal account of Clinton campaign chairman John Podesta.&lt;ref name=":42"&gt;{{Cite news |url=http://edition.cnn.com/2017/10/07/politics/one-year-access-hollywood-russia-podesta-email/index.html |title=Access Hollywood and emails: One year later |last=Cohen |first=Marshall |publisher=CNN|access-date=24 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":41"&gt;{{Cite news |url=http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2016/dec/18/john-podesta/its-true-wikileaks-dumped-podesta-emails-hour-afte/ |title=True: Wikileaks dumped Podesta emails hour after Trump video |work=@politifact|access-date=24 October 2017 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; CNN notes that due to extensive coverage of the Trump tapes, the leaks were an "afterthought" in news coverage.&lt;ref name=":42" /&gt; Podesta suggested that the emails were timed to deflect attention from the Trump tapes.&lt;ref name=":41" /&gt;

In 2010, Donald Trump called WikiLeaks "disgraceful" and suggested that the "death penalty" should be a punishment for WikiLeaks' releases of information.&lt;ref&gt;"[https://edition.cnn.com/2017/01/04/politics/kfile-trump-wikileaks/index.html Trump in 2010: WikiLeaks 'disgraceful,' there 'should be like death penalty or something']". CNN.

(Retrieved 7 March 2017.)&lt;/ref&gt; Trump made many references to WikiLeaks during the course of the campaign; by one estimate, he referenced disclosures by WikiLeaks over 160 times in speeches during the last 30 days of the campaign.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2017/apr/21/jackie-speier/did-trump-really-mention-wikileaks-over-160-times-/ |title=Did Trump mention WikiLeaks over 160 times in October 2016? |work=@politifact|access-date=9 May 2017 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Correspondence between WikiLeaks and Donald Trump Jr. ====
In November 2017, it was revealed that the WikiLeaks Twitter account corresponded with [[Donald Trump Jr.]] during the 2016 presidential election.&lt;ref name=":45"&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2017/11/the-secret-correspondence-between-donald-trump-jr-and-wikileaks/545738/ |title=The Secret Correspondence Between Donald Trump Jr. and WikiLeaks |last=Ioffe |first=Julia |work=The Atlantic|access-date=13 November 2017 |language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; The correspondence shows how WikiLeaks actively solicited the co-operation of Trump Jr., a campaign surrogate and advisor in the campaign of his father. WikiLeaks urged the Trump campaign to reject the results of the 2016 presidential election at a time when it looked as if the Trump campaign would lose.&lt;ref name=":45" /&gt; WikiLeaks asked Trump Jr. to share a false claim by Assange that Hillary Clinton had wanted to attack him with drones.&lt;ref name=":45" /&gt; WikiLeaks also shared a link to a site that would help people to search through WikiLeaks documents.&lt;ref name=":45" /&gt; Trump Jr. shared both. After the election, WikiLeaks also requested that the president-elect push Australia to appoint Assange as ambassador to the US. After ''The New York Times'' published a fragment of Donald Trump's tax returns for one year, WikiLeaks asked Trump Jr. for one or more of his father's tax returns, explaining that it would be in his father's best interest because it would "dramatically improve the perception of our impartiality" and not come "through the most biased source (e.g. NYT/MSNBC)."&lt;ref name=":45" /&gt; WikiLeaks also asked Trump Jr. to leak his own e-mails to them days after ''The New York Times'' broke a story about e-mail correspondence between Trump Jr. and a Kremlin-affiliated lawyer; WikiLeaks said that it would be "beautifully confounding" for them to publish the e-mails and that it would deprive other news outlets from putting a negative spin on the correspondence.&lt;ref name=":45" /&gt; Trump Jr. provided this correspondence to congressional investigators looking into Russian interference in the 2016 election.&lt;ref name=":45" /&gt;

=== Allegations of Russian influence ===
In August 2016, after WikiLeaks published thousands of DNC emails, it was claimed that Russian intelligence had hacked the e-mails and leaked them to WikiLeaks. At the time, DNC officials made such claims, along with a number of cybersecurity experts and cybersecurity firms.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://www.bloomberg.com/view/articles/2016-07-25/cybersecurity-experts-say-russia-hacked-the-democrats |title=Cyber-Experts Say Russia Hacked the Democratic National Committee |last=Lake |first=Eli |date=25 July 2016 |newspaper=Bloomberg View|access-date=23 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://www.wired.com/2016/07/heres-know-russia-dnc-hack/ |title=Here's What We Know About Russia and the DNC Hack |last=Glaser |first=April |newspaper=WIRED|access-date=23 October 2016 |language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; In October 2016, the US intelligence community announced that it was "confident that the Russian Government directed the recent compromises of e-mails from U.S. persons and institutions, including from U.S. political organizations".&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; The US intelligence agencies said that the hacks were consistent with the methods of Russian-directed efforts, and that people high up within the Kremlin were likely involved.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; On 14 October 2016, [[CNN]] reported that "there is mounting evidence that the Russian government is supplying WikiLeaks with hacked emails pertaining to the [[United States presidential election, 2016|U.S. presidential election]]."&lt;ref name="ufge"&gt;Jim Sciutto, Nicole Gaouette and Ryan Browne (14 October 2016).

In September 2016, the German weekly magazine ''[[Focus (German magazine)|Focus]]'' reported that according to a confidential German government dossier, WikiLeaks had long since been infiltrated by Russian agents aiming to discredit [[NATO]] governments. The magazine added that French and British intelligence services had come to the same conclusion and said Russian President [[Vladimir Putin]] and Prime Minister [[Dmitry Medvedev]] receive details about what WikiLeaks publishes before publication.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.focus.de/politik/ausland/merkel-vorgefuehrt-russischer-geheimdienst-nutzt-wikileaks-fuer-kampagnen_id_5977879.html Russischer Geheimdienst nutzt WikiLeaks für Kampagnen] ''[[Focus (German magazine)|Focus]]'' 23 September 2016&lt;/ref&gt; The ''Focus'' report followed a ''[[The New York Times|New York Times]]'' story that suggested that WikiLeaks may be a laundering machine for compromising material about Western countries gathered by Russian spies.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2016/09/01/world/europe/wikileaks-julian-assange-russia.html How Russia Often Benefits When Julian Assange Reveals the West's Secrets] ''[[The New York Times]]'' 31 August 2016&lt;/ref&gt;

On 10 December 2016, several news outlets, including ''[[The Guardian]]'' and ''[[The Washington Post]]'', reported that the [[Central Intelligence Agency]] concluded that Russia intelligence operatives provided materials to WikiLeaks in an effort to help Donald Trump's election bid. ''The Washington Post'' article stated: "The CIA has concluded in a secret assessment that Russia intervened in the 2016 election to help Donald Trump win the presidency, rather than just to undermine confidence in the U.S. electoral system, according to officials briefed on the matter."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/national-security/obama-orders-review-of-russian-hacking-during-presidential-campaign/2016/12/09/31d6b300-be2a-11e6-94ac-3d324840106c_story.html |title=Secret CIA assessment says Russia was trying to help Trump win White House |date=9 December 2016 |newspaper=The Washington Post|access-date=10 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''The Guardian'' article reported, "individuals linked to the Russian government had provided WikiLeaks with thousands of confidential emails stolen from the Democratic National Committee (DNC) and others."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/dec/10/cia-concludes-russia-interfered-to-help-trump-win-election-report |title=CIA concludes Russia interfered to help Trump win election, say reports |date=10 December 2016 |newspaper=The Guardian|access-date=10 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; WikiLeaks has frequently been criticised for its absence of whistleblowing on or criticism of Russia.&lt;ref name=":30" /&gt; ''The Guardian'' notes that journalists are killed frequently in Russia, and notes that ''Freedom House'' has ranked Russian press freedom as "not free ... The main national news agenda is firmly controlled by the Kremlin. The government sets editorial policy at state-owned television stations, which dominate the media landscape and generate propagandistic content.&lt;ref name=":11"&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/media/2016/dec/24/julian-assange-donald-trump-hillary-clinton-interview |title=Julian Assange gives guarded praise of Trump and blasts Clinton in interview |last=Jacobs |first=Ben |date=24 December 2016 |newspaper=The Guardian|access-date=25 December 2016 |issn=0261-3077}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In April 2016, WikiLeaks tweeted criticism of the [[Panama Papers]], which had among other things revealed Russian businesses and individuals linked with [[Offshore financial centre|offshore]] ties (Vladimir Putin's associates had as much as $2&amp;nbsp;billion in offshore accounts).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/investigations/associates-of-russias-putin-had-2-billion-in-offshore-accounts-report-says/2016/04/03/25437e1e-f839-11e5-8b23-538270a1ca31_story.html |title=Putin associates had $2&amp;nbsp;billion in offshore accounts, report says |website=The Washington Post|access-date=8 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":39" /&gt; The WikiLeaks Twitter account tweeted, "#PanamaPapers Putin attack was produced by OCCRP which targets Russia &amp; former USSR and was funded by USAID and [George] Soros".&lt;ref name=":15" /&gt; Putin would later go on to dismiss the Panama Papers by citing WikiLeaks: "WikiLeaks has showed us that official people and official organs of the U.S. are behind this."&lt;ref name=":15" /&gt; According to ''The New York Times'', both Assange claims are substance-free: "there is no evidence suggesting that the United States government had a role in releasing the Panama Papers."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2017/01/06/us/politics/russian-hack-report.html |title=What Intelligence Agencies Concluded About the Russian Attack on the U.S. Election |last=Shane |first=Scott |date=6 January 2017 |newspaper=The New York Times|access-date=7 January 2017 |issn=0362-4331}}&lt;/ref&gt; Assange also falsely asserted that the Panama Papers gave Western figures a free pass, when the leaks in fact reported on a number of high-profile Western politicians, including UK Prime Minister David Cameron.&lt;ref name=":39" /&gt;

In 2012 when WikiLeaks began to run out of funds, Assange began to host a television show on Russia Today, Russia's state-owned news network.&lt;ref name=":16"&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2016/09/01/world/europe/wikileaks-julian-assange-russia.html |title=How Russia Often Benefits When Julian Assange Reveals the West's Secrets |last=Erlanger |first=Jo Becker, Steven |date=31 August 2016 |newspaper=The New York Times|access-date=6 January 2017 |last2=Schmitt |first2=Eric |issn=0362-4331}}&lt;/ref&gt; Assange has never disclosed how much he or WikiLeaks were paid for his tv-show.&lt;ref name=":16" /&gt;

After President Trump's National Security Advisor Michael T. Flynn resigned in February 2017 due to reports over his communications with Russian officials and subsequent lies over the content and nature of those communications, WikiLeaks tweeted that Flynn resigned "after destabilization campaign by U.S. spies, Democrats, press."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=http://www.haaretz.com/us-news/1.771716 |title=Wikileaks: Flynn Resigned Due to 'Destabilization Campaign by U.S. Spies, Democrats, Press ' |last=Haaretz |newspaper=Haaretz|access-date=14 February 2017 |last2=Press |first2=The Associated |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=http://thehill.com/homenews/319386-wikileaks-flynn-leaving-due-to-destabilization-campaign-by-dems-media |title=WikiLeaks: Flynn leaving due to 'destabilization campaign' by Dems, media |last=Shelbourne |first=Mallory |date=14 February 2017 |newspaper=TheHill|access-date=14 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In April 2017, the WikiLeaks Twitter account suggested that the [[Khan Shaykhun chemical attack]], which international human rights organisations and governments of the United States, United Kingdom, Turkey, Saudi Arabia, France, and Israel attributed to the Syrian government, was a [[false flag]] attack.&lt;ref name=":21"&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/worldviews/wp/2017/04/06/trump-loves-a-conspiracy-theory-now-his-allies-in-the-media-say-hes-falling-for-one-in-syria/ |title=Analysis {{!}} Trump loves a conspiracy theory.

In May 2017, cybersecurity experts stated that they believed that groups affiliated with the Russian government were involved in the hacking and leaking of e-mails associated with the Emmanuel Macron campaign; these e-mails were published on [[Pastebin]] but heavily promoted by WikiLeaks social media channels.&lt;ref name=":36" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":37" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":38" /&gt;

In April 2017, CIA Director [[Mike Pompeo]] stated: "It is time to call out WikiLeaks for what it really is – a non-state hostile intelligence service often abetted by state actors like Russia." Pompeo said that the US Intelligence Community had concluded that Russia's "primary propaganda outlet," [[RT (TV network)|RT]] had "actively collaborated" with WikiLeaks.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=http://www.cbsnews.com/news/cia-director-calls-wikileaks-a-non-state-hostile-intelligence-service/ |title=CIA director calls WikiLeaks Russia-aided "non-state hostile intelligence service" |author=Kathryn Watson |date=13 April 2017 |publisher=CBS News}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In August 2017, ''Foreign Policy'' reported that WikiLeaks had in the summer of 2016 turned down a large cache of documents containing information damaging to the Russian government.&lt;ref name=":39" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=http://thehill.com/policy/cybersecurity/347007-wikileaks-rejected-documents-on-russia-during-2016-election |title=WikiLeaks rejected documents on Russia during 2016 election: report |last=Uchill |first=Joe |date=17 August 2017 |work=TheHill|access-date=17 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; WikiLeaks justified this by saying "As far as we recall these are already public ...

In October 2017, it was revealed that [[Cambridge Analytica]], a company working on behalf of the Trump presidential campaign, had contacted WikiLeaks about missing Hillary Clinton e-mails and the possibility of creating a searchable database for the campaign to use.&lt;ref name=":43"&gt;{{Cite news |url=http://edition.cnn.com/2017/10/25/politics/cambridge-analytica-julian-assange-wikileaks-clinton-emails/index.html |title=Trump campaign analytics company contacted WikiLeaks about Clinton emails |last=CNN |first=Kara Scannell, Dana Bash and Marshall Cohen, |publisher=CNN|access-date=26 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":44"&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://apnews.com/020bfc7fb4d5438f9cd7c8c1695cf099/The-Latest:-Wikileaks-confirms-approach-from-Trump-campaign |title=The Latest: Trump_ It's disgrace Democrats paid for dossier |work=AP News|access-date=26 October 2017 |language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; After this was reported, Assange confirmed that WikiLeaks had been approached by Cambridge Analytica but had rejected the approach.&lt;ref name=":43" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":44" /&gt; WikiLeaks did not disclose what the subject of Cambridge Analytica's approach was.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/wikileaks-assange-says-he-rejected-overture-from-trump-linked-group-1508961298 |title=Wikileaks' Assange Says He Rejected Overture From Trump-Linked Group |last=Ballhaus |first=Rebecca |date=25 October 2017 |work=The Wall Street Journal|access-date=26 October 2017 |issn=0099-9660}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Allegations of anti-semitism  ===
WikiLeaks has been accused of anti-semitism.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.haaretz.com/jewish/british-magazine-assange-says-jewish-conspiracy-trying-to-discredit-wikileaks-1.346686 |title=British magazine: Assange says Jewish conspiracy trying to discredit WikiLeaks |website=Haaretz|access-date=23 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite news |url=http://www.slate.com/blogs/the_slatest/2016/07/25/what_wikileaks_might_have_meant_by_that_anti_semitic_tweet.html |title=Here's What WikiLeaks Might Have Meant by That Anti-Semitic Tweet It Deleted |last=Stahl |first=Jeremy |date=25 July 2016 |newspaper=Slate|access-date=23 October 2016 |issn=1091-2339}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite news |url=http://forward.com/news/national/347546/why-does-wikileaks-have-a-reputation-for-anti-semitism/ |title=Why Does Wikileaks Have a Reputation for Anti-Semitism? |newspaper=The Forward|access-date=23 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://www.wired.com/2016/07/wikileaks-officially-lost-moral-high-ground/ |title=WikiLeaks Has Officially Lost the Moral High Ground |last=Ellis |first=Emma Grey |newspaper=WIRED|access-date=23 October 2016 |language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; The WikiLeaks Twitter account tweeted anti-semitic jibes.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; The organisation has called out Jewish "lobbies" and claimed that a "Jewish conspiracy" is attempting to discredit the organisation.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/media/2011/mar/01/julian-assange-jewish-conspiracy-comments |title=Julian Assange 'Jewish conspiracy' comments spark row |last=Quinn |first=Ben |date=1 March 2011 |newspaper=The Guardian|access-date=23 October 2016 |issn=0261-3077}}&lt;/ref&gt; In July 2016, WikiLeaks suggested that [[triple parentheses]], or (((echoes))) – a tool used by neo-Nazis to identify Jews on Twitter, appropriated by Jews across the Twittersphere – had been used as a way for "establishment climbers" to identify one another.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; Assange denied making claims of a Jewish conspiracy, stating, "'Jewish conspiracy' is completely false, in spirit and in word. It is serious and upsetting."&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

In leaked internal conversations, WikiLeaks described a journalist as a "rat" and noted that "he's Jewish".&lt;ref name=":46" /&gt; WikiLeaks also noted that the journalist had been "engaged" in the contesting anti-Semitic jibes on Twitter, and encouraged others to troll the journalist.&lt;ref name=":46" /&gt;

===  Exaggerated and misleading descriptions of the contents of leaks ===
WikiLeaks has been criticised for making misleading claims about the contents of its leaks.&lt;ref name=":7"&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2017/03/09/opinion/the-truth-about-the-wikileaks-cia-cache.html |title=The Truth About the WikiLeaks C.I.A. Cache |last=Tufekci |first=Zeynep |date=9 March 2017 |work=The New York Times|access-date=10 March 2017 |issn=0362-4331}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":34"&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://www.wired.com/2017/03/wikileaks-cia-hack-signal-encrypted-chat-apps/ |title=The CIA Can't Crack Signal and WhatsApp Encryption, No Matter What You've Heard |last=Barrett |first=Brian |work=WIRED|access-date=10 March 2017 |language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; Media outlets have also been criticised for reporting on WikiLeaks' claims about the CIA leak, which were later retracted.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt;

According to [[University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill|University of North Carolina]] Professor [[Zeynep Tufekci]], this is part of a pattern of behaviour. After the [[2016 Turkish coup d'état attempt]], WikiLeaks announced that it would release e-mails belonging to Turkey's ruling conservative [[Justice and Development Party (Turkey)|Justice and Development Party]]. WikiLeaks released Turkish emails and documents as a response to the [[2016–present purges in Turkey|Turkish government's crackdown]] on real or alleged government opponents that followed the coup attempt.&lt;ref name="ThReut_WikiLeaks"/&gt; When these e-mails were released, however, it "was nothing but mundane mailing lists of tens of thousands of ordinary people who discussed politics online. Back then, too, the ruse worked: Many Western journalists had hyped these non-leaks."&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt; According to Tufekci, there are three steps to WikiLeaks' "disinformation campaigns": "The first step is to dump many documents at once — rather than allowing journalists to scrutinise them and absorb their significance before publication. The second step is to sensationalise the material with misleading news releases and tweets. The third step is to sit back and watch as the news media unwittingly promotes the WikiLeaks agenda under the auspices of independent reporting."&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt;

=== Inadequate curation and violations of personal privacy ===
WikiLeaks has drawn criticism for violating the personal privacy of a multitude of individuals and inadequately curating its content. These critics include transparency advocates, such as [[Edward Snowden]], the [[Sunlight Foundation]] and the [[Federation of American Scientists]].&lt;ref name=":31" /&gt;

WikiLeaks has published individuals' [[Social Security number]]s, medical information, and credit card numbers.&lt;ref name=":12" /&gt; An analysis by the Associated Press found that WikiLeaks had in one of its mass-disclosures published "the personal information of hundreds of people – including sick children, rape victims and mental health patients".&lt;ref name=":12" /&gt; WikiLeaks has named teenage rape victims, and outed an individual arrested for homosexuality in Saudi Arabia.&lt;ref name=":12" /&gt; Some of WikiLeaks' cables "described patients with psychiatric conditions, seriously ill children or refugees".&lt;ref name=":12" /&gt; An analysis of WikiLeaks' Saudi cables "turned up more than 500 passport, identity, academic or employment files ... three dozen records pertaining to family issues in the cables – including messages about marriages, divorces, missing children, elopements and custody battles. Many are very personal, like the marital certificates that reveal whether the bride was a virgin. Others deal with Saudis who are deeply in debt, including one man who says his wife stole his money. One divorce document details a male partner's infertility. Others identify the partners of women suffering from sexually transmitted diseases including HIV and Hepatitis C."&lt;ref name=":12" /&gt; Two individuals named in the DNC leaks were targeted by identity thieves following WikiLeaks' reveal of their Social Security and credit card information.&lt;ref name=":12" /&gt; In its leak of DNC e-mails, WikiLeaks revealed the details of an ordinary staffer's suicide attempt and brought attention to it through a tweet.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://fortune.com/2016/10/13/hacked-private-emails/ |title=Publishing Hacked Private Emails Can Be a Slippery Slope |website=Fortune|access-date=6 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://www.buzzfeed.com/zeyneptufekci/dear-france-you-just-got-hacked-dont-make-the-same-mistakes |title=Dear France: You Just Got Hacked.

WikiLeaks' publishing of Sony's hacked e-mails drew criticism for violating the privacy of Sony's employees and for failing to be in the public interest.&lt;ref name=":13"&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://www.bostonglobe.com/opinion/editorials/2015/04/24/wikileaks-and-media-shrinking-our-zone-privacy/6emuRl1zP4Iyl2frKo46uK/story.html |title=Wikileaks has done far more damage to privacy than the NSA |author=Michael A.

Cohen, a fellow at the Century Foundation, argues that "data dumps like these represent a threat to our already shrinking zone of privacy."&lt;ref name=":13" /&gt; He noted that the willingness of WikiLeaks to publish information of this type encourages hacking and cybertheft: "With ready and willing amplifiers, what's to deter the next cyberthief from stealing a company's database of information and threatening to send it to Wikileaks if a list of demands aren't met?"&lt;ref name=":13" /&gt;

The [[Sunlight Foundation]], a nonprofit that advocates for open government, has criticised WikiLeaks for inadequate curation of its content and for "weaponised transparency," writing that with the DNC leaks, "Wikileaks again failed the due diligence review we expect of putatively journalistic entities when it published the personal information of ordinary citizens, including passport and Social Security numbers contained in the hacked emails of Democratic National Committee staff. We are not alone in raising ethical questions about Wikileaks' shift from whistleblower to platform for weaponised transparency. Any organisation that 'doxxes' a public is harming privacy."&lt;ref name=":14"&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://sunlightfoundation.com/2016/07/28/on-weaponized-transparency/ |title=On weaponized transparency |authors=Alex Howard &amp; John Wonderlich |date=28 July 2016 |publisher=Sunlight Foundation}}&lt;/ref&gt; The manner in which WikiLeaks publishes content can have the effect of censoring political enemies: "Wikileaks' indiscriminate disclosure in this case is perhaps the closest we've seen in reality to the bogeyman projected by enemies to reform — that transparency is just a Trojan Horse for chilling speech and silencing political enemies."&lt;ref name=":14" /&gt;

In July 2016, [[Edward Snowden]] criticised WikiLeaks for insufficiently curating its content.&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt; When Snowden made data public, he did so by working with the ''Washington Post'', the ''Guardian'' and other news organisations, choosing only to make documents public which exposed National Security Agency surveillance programs.&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt; Content that compromised national security or exposed sensitive personal information was withheld.&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt; WikiLeaks, on the other hand, makes little effort to remove sensitive personal information or withhold content with adverse national security implications. WikiLeaks responded by accusing Snowden of pandering to Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton.&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt;

University of North Carolina Professor [[Zeynep Tufekci]] has criticised WikiLeaks for exposing sensitive personal information: "WikiLeaks, for example, gleefully tweeted to its millions of followers that a Clinton Foundation employee had attempted suicide ... Data dumps by WikiLeaks have outed rape victims and gay people in Saudi Arabia, private citizens' emails and personal information in Turkey, and the voice mail messages of Democratic National Committee staff members."&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt; She argues these data dumps which violate personal privacy without being in the public interest "threaten our ability to dissent by destroying privacy and unleashing a glut of questionable information that functions, somewhat unexpectedly, as its own form of censorship, rather than as a way to illuminate the maneuverings of the powerful."&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt;

In January 2017, the WikiLeaks Task Force, a Twitter account associated with WikiLeaks,&lt;ref name=":19"&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/tech/news/2017/01/06/wikileaks-threatens-publish-twitter-users-personal-info/96254138/ |title=WikiLeaks threatens to publish Twitter users' personal info |author=Jessica Guynn |date=6 January 2017 |newspaper=USA Today}}&lt;/ref&gt; proposed the creation of a database to track verified Twitter users, including sensitive personal information on individuals' homes, families and finances.&lt;ref name=":18"&gt;{{Cite news |url=http://www.chicagotribune.com/news/nationworld/ct-wikileaks-tracking-verified-twitter-20170106-story.html |title=WikiLeaks proposes tracking verified Twitter users' homes, families and finances |last=Fung |first=Brian |newspaper=Chicago Tribune|access-date=6 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":19" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=http://thehill.com/policy/technology/313071-wikileaks-floats-creating-database-of-twitter-users-personal-data |title=WikiLeaks floats creating database of Twitter users' personal data |last=Mali |first=Meghashyam |date=6 January 2017 |newspaper=The Hill|access-date=6 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to the ''Chicago Tribune'', "the proposal faced a sharp and swift backlash as technologists, journalists and security researchers slammed the idea as a 'sinister' and dangerous abuse of power and privacy."&lt;ref name=":18" /&gt; Twitter furthermore bans the use of Twitter data for "surveillance purposes," stating "Posting another person's private and confidential information is a violation of the Twitter rules."&lt;ref name=":19" /&gt;

=== Internal conflicts and lack of transparency ===
Within WikiLeaks, there has been public disagreement between founder and spokesperson [[Julian Assange]] and [[Daniel Domscheit-Berg]], the website's former German representative who was suspended by Assange. Domscheit-Berg announced on 28 September 2010 that he was leaving the organisation due to internal conflicts over management of the website.&lt;ref name="bates"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.aolnews.com/2010/09/28/wikileaks-woes-grow-as-spokesman-quits-site/ |title=WikiLeaks' Woes Grow as Spokesman Quits Site |author=Bates, Theunis |date=28 September 2010 |work=AOL News|access-date=22 October 2010 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140209122932/http://www.aolnews.com/2010/09/28/wikileaks-woes-grow-as-spokesman-quits-site/ |archivedate=9 February 2014 |deadurl=yes |df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.physorg.com/news205093515.html |title=WikiLeaks chief lashes out at media during debate |last=Satter |first=Raphael G. |date=30 September 2010 |publisher=PhysOrg.com|access-date=22 October 2010 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101020041136/http://www.physorg.com/news205093515.html |archivedate=20 October 2010 |deadurl=no |agency=Associated Press}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/g/a/2010/09/28/businessinsider-wikileaks-spokesman-quits.DTL |title=WikiLeaks Spokesman Quits, Blasts Founder Julian Assange As Paranoid Control Freak, Admits To Using Fake Name |last=Blodget |first=Henry |date=28 September 2010 |newspaper=San Francisco Chronicle|access-date=12 December 2010 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120306180126/http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=%2Fg%2Fa%2F2010%2F09%2F28%2Fbusinessinsider-wikileaks-spokesman-quits.DTL |archivedate=6 March 2012 |deadurl=no |authorlink=Henry Blodget |df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Those working for WikiLeaks are reportedly required to sign sweeping [[non-disclosure agreement]]s covering all conversations, conduct, and material, with Assange having sole power over disclosure.&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://www.buzzfeed.com/jamesball/heres-what-i-learned-about-julian-assange |title=Here's What I Learned About Julian Assange While Working Alongside Him |newspaper=BuzzFeed|access-date=23 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The penalty for non-compliance in one such agreement was reportedly £12&amp;nbsp;million.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; WikiLeaks has been challenged for this practice, as it seen to be hypocritical for an organisation dedicated to transparency to limit the transparency of its inner workings and limit the accountability of powerful individuals in the organisation.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://www.wired.com/2011/05/nda-wikileaks/ |title=WikiLeaks Threatens Its Own Leakers With $20 Million Penalty |last=Poulsen |first=Kevin |newspaper=WIRED|access-date=23 October 2016 |language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2011/may/12/wikileaks-confidentiality-agreement-julian-assange |title=WikiLeaks, get out of the gagging game |date=12 May 2011 |newspaper=The Guardian|access-date=23 October 2016 |issn=0261-3077}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Also in April 2017, [[United States Attorney General|Attorney General]] [[Jeff Sessions]] stated that arresting Julian Assange of WikiLeaks was a priority: "We have professionals that have been in the security business of the United States for many years that are shocked by the number of leaks and some of them are quite serious.
