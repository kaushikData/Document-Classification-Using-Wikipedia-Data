'''''Bank Markazi v. Peterson''''', 578 U.S. ___ (2016), was a [[Supreme Court of the United States|United States Supreme Court]] case that found that a law which only applied to a specific case, identified by [[Docket (court)|docket number]], and eliminated all of the defenses one party had raised does not violate the [[Separation of powers under the United States Constitution|separation of powers]] in the [[United States Constitution]] between the legislative ([[Congress of the United States|Congress]]) and [[judiciary|judicial]] branches of government. The [[plaintiff]]s in the [[trial court]], respondents in the Supreme Court, were several parties who had obtained [[Judgment (law)|judgments]] against [[Iran]] for its role in supporting [[state-sponsored terrorism]], particularly the [[1983 Beirut barracks bombings]] and 1996 [[Khobar Towers bombing]], and sought [[Writ of execution|execution]] against a bank account in New York held, through European intermediaries, on behalf of [[Central Bank of the Islamic Republic of Iran|Bank Markazi]], the [[State ownership|state-owned]] [[Central Bank]] of Iran. The initial plaintiffs obtained court orders preventing the transfer of funds from the account in 2008 and initiated their lawsuit in 2010. Bank Markazi raised several defenses against the execution against the account, including that the account was not an asset ''of'' the bank, but rather an asset of its European intermediary, under both New York state property law and §201(a) of the [[Terrorism Risk Insurance Act]]. In response to concerns that existing laws were insufficient for the account to be used to settle the judgments, Congress included a section within a 2012 bill, [[Codification (law)|codified]] after enactment as 22 [[United States Code|U.S.C.]] §&amp;nbsp;8772, that identified the pending lawsuit by docket number, applied only to the assets in the identified case, and essentially abrogated every legal basis available to Bank Markazi to prevent the plaintiffs from executing their claims against the account. Bank Markazi then argued that §&amp;nbsp;8772 was an unconstitutional breach of the separation of power between the legislative and judicial branches of government, because it effectively directed a particular result in a single case without changing the generally applicable law. The [[United States District Court for the Southern District of New York]] and, on appeal, the [[United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit]] both upheld the constitutionality of §&amp;nbsp;8772 and cleared the way for the plaintiffs to execute their judgments against the account, which held about $1.75&amp;nbsp;billion in cash.

The United States Supreme Court granted [[certiorari]] and heard oral arguments in the case in January 2016, releasing their opinion in April 2016. A 6–2 majority found that §&amp;nbsp;8772 was not unconstitutional, because it "changed the law by establishing new substantive standards"&lt;ref name="Slip opinion majority"/&gt;{{Rp|18}}—essentially, that if Iran owns the assets, they would be available for execution against judgments against Iran—for the district court to apply to the case.&lt;ref name="Slip opinion majority"/&gt;{{Rp|18–19}} [[Associate Justice of the United States Supreme Court|Justice]] [[Ruth Bader Ginsburg]], writing for the majority, explained that the federal judiciary has long upheld laws that affect one or a very small number of subjects as a valid exercise of Congress' legislative power&lt;ref name="Slip opinion majority"/&gt;{{Rp|21}} and that the Supreme Court had previously upheld a statute that applied to cases identified by docket number in ''Robertson v. Seattle Audubon Society''&amp;nbsp;(1992).&lt;ref name="Slip opinion majority"/&gt;{{Rp|19}} The majority also upheld §&amp;nbsp;8772 as a valid exercise of Congress' authority over foreign affairs. Prior to the enactment of the [[Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act]]&amp;nbsp;(FSIA) in 1976, Congress and the Executive branch had authority to determine the immunity of foreign states from lawsuits. Despite transferring the authority to determine immunity to the courts through the FSIA, the majority contended that "it remains Congress' prerogative to alter a foreign state's immunity."&lt;ref name="Slip opinion majority"/&gt;{{Rp|23}}

[[Chief Justice of the United States|Chief Justice]] [[John Roberts]], joined by Justice [[Sonia Sotomayor]], dissented and harshly criticized the majority's holding. After providing historical context for the separation of powers between the legislature and judiciary found in [[Article III of the United States Constitution]], the Chief Justice explained that §&amp;nbsp;8772 is a type of unconstitutional breach of the separation of powers between Congress and the judiciary "whereby Congress assumes the role of judge and decides a particular case in the first instance."&lt;ref name="Slip opinion dissent"/&gt;{{Rp|7}} In his view, §&amp;nbsp;8772 is no different than a hypothetical law applying to a case ''Smith v. Jones'' in which the legislature says simply "Smith wins". In the Chief Justice's view, §&amp;nbsp;8772 was not a valid exercise of Congress' foreign affairs authority; he contended that Congress and the Executive branch have sufficient authority that they do not need to "seize" the judiciary's power to "make a political decision look like a judicial one."&lt;ref name="Slip opinion dissent"/&gt;{{Rp|16}} Quoting [[James Madison]] in ''[[Federalist No. 48]]'', the Chief Justice lamented that this case "will indeed become a blueprint for extensive expansion of the legislative power at the judiciary's expense, feeding Congress's tendency to 'extend[] the sphere of its activity and draw[] all power into its impetuous vortex.'"&lt;ref name="Slip opinion dissent"/&gt;{{Rp|16–17}}

The decision came as Iran was seeking access to the world financial market just three months after [[sanctions against Iran|many sanctions]] were lifted as a result of Iran's compliance with [[Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action|an agreement]] for curtailing development of [[Nuclear program of Iran|its nuclear enrichment program]]. Various Iranian officials denounced the decision as "theft",&lt;ref name="Reuters: decision reaction"/&gt; "a ridicule of law and justice",&lt;ref name="Reuters: decision reaction"/&gt; and "open hostility by the United States against the Iranian people."&lt;ref name="AFP: Khamenei remarks"/&gt; Iran announced that they would file suit against the United States in the [[International Court of Justice]] (ICJ) for reparations if the U.S. courts begin to "plunder"&lt;ref name="NYT: ICJ action threatened"/&gt; assets from the Citibank account to give to the winning plaintiffs, although it is not clear if the ICJ would have jurisdiction to entertain the case.

==Background==

===State immunity===
Foreign states generally enjoy [[state immunity|immunity from lawsuits]] in the United States under the [[Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act]] (FSIA). The FSIA is the exclusive basis for U.S. courts to exercise [[jurisdiction]] over a foreign government.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Stewart|first1=David P.|title=The Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act: A Guide for Judges|date=2013|publisher=Federal Judicial Center|page=1|url=http://www.fjc.gov/public/pdf.nsf/lookup/fsiaguide2013.pdf/$file/fsiaguide2013.pdf|accessdate=31 May 2016|quote=The [FSIA] provides the exclusive basis for obtaining jurisdiction over these entities in U.S. courts (including special rules for service of process) and contains 'a comprehensive set of legal standards governing claims of immunity in every civil action against a foreign state or its political subdivisions, agencies, or instrumentalities.'}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{ussc|name=OBB Personenverkehr AG v. Sachs|link=OBB Personenverkehr AG v. Sachs|volume=577|year=2015|docket=13-1067|slip=3}}&lt;/ref&gt; Prior to enactment of the FSIA in 1976, the executive branch was responsible for determining the immunity of foreign states on a case-by-case basis. By enacting the FSIA, Congress codified the guidelines for the immunity of foreign states and transferred responsibility for determining a foreign state's immunity from the executive branch to the judiciary.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Stewart|first1=David P.|title=The Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act: A Guide for Judges|date=2013|publisher=Federal Judicial Center|pages=5–6|url=http://www.fjc.gov/public/pdf.nsf/lookup/fsiaguide2013.pdf/$file/fsiaguide2013.pdf|accessdate=31 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{USC|28|1602}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Slip opinion majority"/&gt;{{Rp|22–23}}

The FSIA contains an exception to the immunity of foreign states for victims of state-sponsored terrorism.&lt;ref&gt;{{USC|28|1605A}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Slip opinion majority"/&gt;{{Rp|2–3}} Prior to 2002, if a judgment was awarded against a foreign government, only assets of the foreign government that were located in the U.S. and "used for commercial activity" could have been seized to satisfy the judgment.&lt;ref name="Slip opinion majority"/&gt;{{Rp|3}} To make judgments easier to enforce, Congress enacted the [[Terrorism Risk Insurance Act of 2002]] (TRIA) which allows judgments to be executed against "the blocked assets of [a] terrorist party."&lt;ref name="TRIA 201(a)"&gt;{{cite act |title=Terrorism Risk Insurance Act of 2002 |type=Public Law |number=107-297 |language= |date=2002 |article=II, §201(a) |articletype=Title |page= |url=https://www.congress.gov/bill/107th-congress/house-bill/3210/text/pl |ref=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Slip opinion majority"/&gt;{{Rp|3}} Blocked assets include assets that may be seized by the [[President of the United States of America|President]] pursuant to his authority granted by [[United States Congress|Congress]].&lt;ref name="Slip opinion majority"/&gt;{{Rp|4}}

===Litigation before §&amp;nbsp;8772 was enacted &lt;!-- Alternate (better?) title: Initial litigation against the Citibank account --&gt;===
The suit involved more than 1300 individuals who had won several separate [[Judgment (law)|judgments]] against Iran for its supportive role in the [[1983 Beirut barracks bombings]], the 1996 [[Khobar Towers bombing]], several other bombings, an assassination, and a kidnapping.&lt;ref name="Bank Markazi cert opposition"&gt;{{Cite report |authors=Liviu Voegel (Counsel of record)|date=2015 |title=In the Supreme Court of the United States: Bank Markazi, the Central Bank of Iran, Petitioner, v.

And I don't care what you thought the law was, decide it this way.|Bank Markazi, oral argument}}

His dissenting opinion is discussed in detail below.

==Opinion of the Court==
[[File:Ruth Bader Ginsburg, official SCOTUS portrait, crop.jpg|thumb|upright=0.6|alt=headshot portrait of Justice Ginsburg|Justice Ginsburg, who authored the majority opinion]]
Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg wrote the majority opinion, which held that §&amp;nbsp;8772 does not infringe on the separation of powers between the legislative and judicial branches of government, considering also that the law is an exercise of congressional authority regarding foreign affairs.&lt;ref name="Slip opinion majority"/&gt; Justice [[Anthony Kennedy]], Justice [[Clarence Thomas]], Justice [[Stephen Breyer]], Justice [[Samuel Alito]], and Justice [[Elena Kagan]] joined the majority opinion (however, Justice Thomas did not join as to Part II-C of the opinion).&lt;ref name="SCOTUS docket"/&gt;

The majority began by explaining that judiciary's authority under [[Article III of the United States Constitution]] is to "'say what the law is'", quoting ''[[Marbury v. Madison]]'' (1803).&lt;ref name="Slip opinion majority"/&gt;{{Rp|12}} "Congress, no doubt, may not usurp a court's power to interpret and apply the law to the circumstances before it"&lt;ref&gt;''Bank Markazi'', slip op. at 12 (internal citations omitted)&lt;/ref&gt; by, for example, saying in a hypothetical case ''Smith v. Jones'' that Smith wins&lt;ref name="Slip opinion majority"/&gt;{{Rp|12–13 &lt;!-- (n. 13) --&gt;}} or compelling the courts to reexamine a case after final judgment has been issued.&lt;ref name="Slip opinion majority"/&gt;{{Rp|13}}

Bank Markazi relied on ''[[United States v. Klein]]'' (1871) for much of its argument.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author1=Morrison, Alan|authorlink1=Alan Morrison (lawyer)|title=Bank Markazi v. Peterson – Equity and Justice versus the Separation of Powers|url=http://www.gwlr.org/bank-markazi-v-peterson-equity-and-justice-versus-the-separation-of-powers/|website=[[The George Washington Law Review]]|publisher=[[The George Washington University Law School]]|date=April 21, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In ''Klein'', the Court questioned whether "'the legislature may prescribe rules of decision to the Judicial Department&amp;nbsp;... in cases pending before it.'"&lt;ref&gt;''Bank Markazi'', slip op. at 15 (quoting ''Klein'', 13 Wall., at 146)&lt;/ref&gt; The majority found that "[o]ne cannot take this language from ''Klein'' at face value"&lt;ref&gt;''Bank Markazi'', slip op. at 15 (internal citations omitted)&lt;/ref&gt; because the power of Congress to make retroactive laws applicable to pending cases has long been recognized.&lt;ref name="Slip opinion majority"/&gt;{{Rp|15}} The majority explained that the contemporary significance of ''Klein'' is that "Congress may not exercise its authority, including its power to regulate federal jurisdiction, in a way that requires [federal courts]...to become active participants in violating the Constitution."&lt;ref&gt;''Bank Markazi'', slip op. at 15 n. 19 (internal citations omitted)&lt;/ref&gt; The unfairness of any retroactive legislation is "'not a sufficient reason for a court to fail to give that law its intended scope.'"&lt;ref&gt;''Bank Markazi'', slip op. at 16 (quoting ''Landgraf v. USI Film Products'', 511 U.S. 244, 267–268 (1994))&lt;/ref&gt; The Constitution contains only limited constraints on the enactment of retroactive legislation:
{{quote|The [[Ex Post Facto Clause]] flatly prohibits retroactive application of penal legislation. Article I, §10, cl. 1, prohibits States from passing&amp;nbsp;... laws '[[Contract Clause#Modification of private contracts|impairing the Obligation of Contracts]].' The [[Fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Fifth Amendment]]'s [[Takings Clause]] prevents the Legislature (and other government actors) from depriving private persons of vested property rights except for a 'public use' and upon payment of 'just compensation.' [[Bill of attainder#United States|The prohibitions]] of '[[Bill of attainder|Bills of Attainder]]' in Art. I, &lt;!-- quoted text uses two section symbols --&gt;§§9–10, prohibit legislatures from singling out summary punishment for past conduct. The [[Due Process Clause]] also protects the interests in fair notice and repose that may be compromised by retroactive legislation; a justification sufficient to validate a statute's prospective application under the Clause 'may not suffice' to warrant its retroactive application.|''Bank Markazi'', slip op. at 16 (2016) (quoting ''Landgraf v. USI Film Products'', 511 U.S. 244, 266–267 (1994))}}
The majority affirmed that "Congress may indeed direct courts to apply newly enacted, outcome-altering legislation in pending civil cases,"&lt;ref name="Slip opinion majority"/&gt;{{Rp|16}} citing its previous decisions in ''[[Plaut v. Spendthrift Farm, Inc.]]''&amp;nbsp;(1995), ''[[Robertson v. Seattle Audubon Society]]''&amp;nbsp;(1992), and ''[[Landgraf v. USI Film Products]]''&amp;nbsp;(1994).&lt;ref name="Slip opinion majority"/&gt;{{Rp|16}} Accordingly, the majority found that §&amp;nbsp;8772 "changed the law by establishing new substantive standards"&lt;ref name="Slip opinion majority"/&gt;{{Rp|18}}—essentially, that if Iran owns the assets, they would be available for execution against judgments against Iran—for the district court to apply to the case.&lt;ref name="Slip opinion majority"/&gt;{{Rp|18–19}} Section&amp;nbsp;8772 left several issues for the District Court to adjudicate: it did not define its key terms "beneficial interest" and "equitable title"; whether any other party had a constitutionally protected interest in the account; and whether the assets were "held in the United States" (Clearstream argued the assets were located in Luxembourg, not New York).&lt;ref name="Slip opinion majority"/&gt;{{Rp|17}}

The fact that the law only applied to one case does not change its validity,&lt;ref name="Slip opinion majority"/&gt;{{Rp|20–22}} although the majority conceded that a narrowly crafted law affecting just one person or a limited number of people may violate the [[Equal Protection Clause]] of the [[Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Fourteenth Amendment]] "if arbitrary or inadequately justified."&lt;ref name="Slip opinion majority"/&gt;{{Rp|21 &lt;!-- (n. 27) --&gt;}} The federal judiciary has long upheld laws that affect one or a very small number of subjects as a valid exercise of Congress' legislative power,&lt;ref name="Slip opinion majority"/&gt;{{Rp|21}} and the Supreme Court upheld a statute that applied to cases identified by docket number in ''Robertson v. Seattle Audubon Society''&amp;nbsp;(1992).&lt;ref name="Slip opinion majority"/&gt;{{Rp|19}}

The final portion of the majority's opinion, in which Justice Thomas did not join,&lt;ref name="SCOTUS docket"/&gt; upheld §&amp;nbsp;8772 as a valid exercise of Congress' authority to regulate foreign affairs.&lt;ref name="Slip opinion majority"/&gt;{{Rp|22}} Citing ''[[Dames &amp; Moore v.

Prior to the enactment of the Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act (FSIA), the Executive branch routinely made case-specific determinations of the scope of immunity for foreign states.&lt;ref name="Slip opinion majority"/&gt;{{Rp|23}} Those decisions were not rejected as infringements on the judiciary's authority. Although the enactment of the FSIA in 1976 transferred authority to the courts to determine foreign-state immunity, the majority held that "it remains Congress' prerogative to alter a foreign state's immunity."&lt;ref name="Slip opinion majority"/&gt;{{Rp|23}} When Congress enacted §&amp;nbsp;8772, it "acted comfortably within the political branches' authority over foreign sovereign immunity and foreign-state assets."&lt;ref name="Slip opinion majority"/&gt;{{Rp|23}}

===Chief Justice Roberts' dissenting opinion===
[[File:File-Official roberts CJ cropped.jpg|thumb|upright=0.6|alt=headshot portrait of Chief Justice Roberts|Chief Justice Roberts wrote a dissenting opinion]]
Chief Justice John Roberts, joined by Justice [[Sonia Sotomayor]], dissented from the majority's ruling.

Roberts began his argument with an analogy:
{{quote|Imagine your neighbor sues you, claiming that your fence is on his property. His evidence is a letter from the previous owner of your home, accepting your neighbor's version of the facts. Your defense is an official county map, which under state law establishes the boundaries of your land. The map shows the fence on your side of the property line. You also argue that your neighbor's claim is six months outside the statute of limitations.

Now imagine that while the lawsuit is pending, your neighbor persuades the legislature to enact a new statute. The new statute provides that for your case, and your case alone, a letter from one neighbor to another is conclusive of property boundaries, and the statute of limitations is one year longer. Your neighbor wins. Who would you say decided your case: the legislature, which targeted your specific case and eliminated your specific defenses so as to ensure your neighbor's victory, or the court, which presided over the ''fait accompli''?

That question lies at the root of the case the Court confronts today.|''Bank Markazi'', slip op. at 1 (2016) (Roberts, C.J., dissenting)}}
In the Chief Justice's view, §&amp;nbsp;8772 violates the separation of powers in Article III "[n]o less than if [Congress] had passed a law saying 'respondents win.'"&lt;ref name="Slip opinion dissent"/&gt;{{Rp|1–2}} The majority responded that a more appropriate analogy to the case is if a legislature enacts a law specifying that a 2000 map supersedes a 1990 map in an ongoing property dispute in which the parties are contesting whether an ambiguous statute makes a 1990 or 2000 county map the authoritative source for establishing property boundaries.&lt;ref name="Slip opinion majority"/&gt;{{Rp|19}}

The Chief Justice proceeded to detail the origin, purpose, and case law history of the separation of powers.

In the hypothetical case of ''Smith v.

Finally, the Chief Justice distinguished this case from ''Dames &amp; Moore''.

===Payout to plaintiff-respondents===

===Legal community reactions===
Attorney and law professor [[Alan Morrison (lawyer)|Alan Morrison]], writing for ''[[The George Washington Law Review]]'', remarked that:&lt;ref name="GWLR: Morrison"/&gt;
{{quote|To a non-lawyer trying to decide who should win just on the equity, the Bank’s chances did not look very good, and on April 20, 2016, the Supreme Court ... upheld the constitutionality of § 8772, thereby removing a major barrier to the victims collecting at least some of their judgments. Those were the atmospherics, but on the legal issues, there was substantial agreement between the two opinions, although in their conclusions they were very far apart. All of the Justices agreed that Congress could pass laws changing the existing law and make those changes generally applicable to pending cases, provided it did so clearly. They also agreed that Congress could not pass a law in a pending case that said something along the lines of, “The Court is directed to enter judgment for the plaintiff,” or that “The plaintiff wins and defendant loses.” To do so would usurp the judicial role and improperly expand that of Congress. Nor could Congress change the law in a way that re-opened a case in which there was a final judgment not subject to further appeal. There was also agreement that Congress could write laws that applied to a limited category of cases, at least in those cases in which only the Government was adversely affected by the change in the law. The issue here was where § 8772 fell on that spectrum.}}
Morrison expressed "concern ... that what happened here will repeat itself in other circumstances in which the equities [are] quite different".&lt;ref name="GWLR: Morrison"/&gt; Although Morrison suggested that an individual aggrieved by such a law could bring a claim for relief under the [[Equal Protection Clause]] of the [[Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Fourteenth Amendment]], he argued that such a claim is unlikely to be successful because the law will likely be upheld when reviewed under the [[Rational basis review|rational basis test]].&lt;ref name="GWLR: Morrison"&gt;{{cite web|author1=Morrison, Alan B.|authorlink1=Alan Morrison (lawyer)|title=Bank Markazi v.

Law professor Evan Zoldan, writing in the ''Yale Law &amp; Policy Review Inter Alia'', noted that the ruling allowed Congress to pick a winner in a particular pending case. He wrote that "By permitting Congress to direct judgment in favor of victims of terrorism, the Bank Markazi Court helped compensate hundreds of people who suffered great tragedies. But, perhaps inadvertently, the Court also conferred on Congress the expansive, and dangerous, power to target an individual for special treatment that is not applied to the population in general."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Zoldan|first1=Evan|title=Bank Markazi and the Undervaluation of Legislative Generality|url=http://ylpr.yale.edu/inter_alia/bank-markazi-and-undervaluation-legislative-generality|website=Yale Law &amp; Policy Review|publisher=Yale Law School|accessdate=February 12, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Stuart Newberger, an attorney who represents terror victims, the ruling could hinder foreign governments from using the judiciary to override determinations by Congress and the President regarding the availability of their assets to satisfy judgments against them.&lt;ref name="Law360 Weinberger"/&gt; Newberger praised the ruling as "a message for any country that if Congress and the president take steps to freeze assets, make assets available to victims, that the courts are going to defer."&lt;ref name="Law360 Weinberger"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Weinberger|first1=Evan|title=Iran Bank Ruling Will Keep Courts Out Of Foreign Affairs|url=https://www.crowell.com/files/20160420-Iran-Bank-Ruling-Will-Keep-Courts-Out-Of-Foreign-Affairs-Newberger.pdf|accessdate=8 June 2016|work=[[Law360]]|date=April 20, 2016|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160608024252/https://www.crowell.com/files/20160420-Iran-Bank-Ruling-Will-Keep-Courts-Out-Of-Foreign-Affairs-Newberger.pdf|archivedate=June 8, 2016|deadurl=no|format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{United States patent law}}
As with all utility patents in the United States, a [[biological patent]] provides the [[patent]] holder with the right to exclude others from making, using, selling, or importing the claimed [[invention]] or discovery in [[biology]] for a limited period of time - for patents filed after 1998, 20 years from the filing date.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Cook-Deegan|first=Robert|title=Gene patents|url=http://www.thehastingscenter.org/publications/briefingbook/detail.aspx?id=2174|publisher=The Hastings Center|accessdate=10 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Until recently, natural biological substances themselves could be patented (apart from any associated process or usage) in the United States if they were sufficiently "isolated" from their naturally occurring states. Prominent historical examples of such patents on isolated products of nature include [[adrenaline]], [[insulin]], [[Vitamin B12|vitamin B&lt;sub&gt;12&lt;/sub&gt;]], and [[Biological patent|gene patents]]. However, the [[Supreme Court of the United States|US Supreme Court]] ruled in 2013 that mere isolation by itself is not sufficient for something to be deemed inventive subject matter.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Sheehan|first1=Teige|title=The Supreme Court Holds Genes Are Patent-Ineligible Products of Nature|url=http://www.hrfmlaw.com/img/articles/The_Supreme_Court_Holds_Genes_Are_Patent-Ineligible_Products_of_Nature_article_295628.pdf|accessdate=22 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The United States has been patenting chemical compositions based upon human products for over 100 years.
The first patent for a human product was granted on March 20, 1906, for a purified form of [[adrenaline]]. It was challenged and upheld in [[Parke-Davis|''Parke-Davis v. Mulford'']].&lt;ref&gt;Parke-Davis &amp; Co. v. H.K. Mulford Co., 189 F. 95 (C.C.S.D.N.Y. 1911), Learned Hand, J.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Learned Hand|Judge Hand]] argued that natural substances when they are purified are more useful than the original natural substances.&lt;ref&gt;Dutfield, Graham. "DNA Patenting: Implications for Public Health Research." [[Bulletin of the World Health Organization]], May 2006, Volume 85, Issue 5.&lt;/ref&gt;

The 1970s marked the first time when scientists patented methods on their biotechnological inventions with [[recombinant DNA]].  It wasn’t until 1980 that patents for whole-scale living organisms were permitted.  In 1980, the U.S. Supreme Court, in ''[[Diamond v. Chakrabarty]]'', upheld the first patent on a newly created living organism, a bacterium for digesting crude oil in oil spills. The patent examiner for the [[United States Patent and Trademark Office]] had rejected the patent of a living organism, but [[Ananda Mohan Chakrabarty|Chakrabarty]] appealed. As a rule, raw natural material is generally rejected for patent approval by the USPTO. The Court ruled that as long as the organism is truly "man-made," such as through genetic engineering, then it is patentable. Because the DNA of Chakrabarty's organism was modified, it was patentable.

Since that 1980 court case, there has been much patenting of [[genetically modified organisms]].  This includes bacteria (as just mentioned), viruses, seeds, plants, cells, and even non-human animals.   Isolated and manipulated cells  - even human cells - can also be patented.  In 1998, the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office (PTO) issued a broad patent claiming primate (including human) embryonic stem cells, entitled "Primate Embryonic Stem Cells" ({{Cite patent|US|5843780}}). On 13 March 2001, a second patent ({{Cite patent|US|6200806}}) was issued with the same title but focused on human embryonic stem cells.   In another example, a genetically modified mouse, dubbed the [[Oncomouse]], that is useful for studying cancer, was patented by [[Harvard University]] as {{Cite patent|US|4736866}}.

Companies and organizations, like the [[University of California]], have patented entire [[genome]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Stix, Gary. “Owning The Stuff Of Life.” [[Scientific American]], Feb. 2006, Volume 294, Issue 2.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Food patents==
An early example of a food patent is the patent granted to [[RiceTec]] for [[basmati]] rice in 1997.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Luke Harding in New Delhi |url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2001/aug/23/highereducation.biologicalscience |title=India outraged as US company wins patents on rice &amp;#124; World news |publisher=The Guardian |date= August 23, 2001|accessdate=2012-08-03 |location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1999, a patent was filed for a peanut butter and jelly sandwich that was without crust.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=&amp;bull; 5:30 am PDT |url=http://www.good.is/post/can-you-patent-a-sandwich/ |title=Can You Patent a Sandwich? - Lifestyle - GOOD |publisher=Good.is |date=2011-09-26 |accessdate=2012-08-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; Agriculture giant [[Monsanto]] filed for a patent on certain [[pig]] genes in 2004.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Feature story - August 2, 2005 |url=http://www.greenpeace.org/international/en/news/features/monsanto-pig-patent-111/ |title=Monsanto files patent for new invention: the pig &amp;#124; Greenpeace International |publisher=Greenpeace.org |date=2005-08-02 |accessdate=2012-08-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Gene patents==
A gene patent is a patent on a specific isolated [[gene]] sequence, its [[chemical composition]], the processes for obtaining or using it, or a combination of such [[Claim (patent)|claims]].  With respect to subject matter, gene patents may be considered a subset of the broader category of biological patents.

Gene patents may claim the isolated natural sequences of genes, the use of a natural sequence for purposes such as diagnostic testing, or a natural sequence that has been altered by adding a promoter or other changes to make it more useful.  In the United States, patents on genes have only been granted on isolated gene sequences with known functions, and these patents cannot be applied to the naturally occurring genes in humans or any other naturally occurring organism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Federal Register - Utility Examination Guidelines -  Comments and Responses|url=http://frwebgate.access.gpo.gov/cgi-bin/getdoc.cgi?dbname=2001_register&amp;docid=01-322-filed|date=January 5, 2001|accessdate=April 5, 2010}} See Comment 2 in which this objection is specifically raised and addressed.&lt;/ref&gt;

The "[[Diamond v. Chakrabarty|Chakrabarty patent]]", owned by [[General Electric]], was filed in 1972 and issued in 1981 after the Supreme Court decision discussed above.&lt;ref name=Rimmer&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Rimmer |first1=Matthew |title=Genentech and the Stolen Gene: Patent Law and Pioneer Inventions |journal=Bio-Science Law Review |date=2002-2003 |volume=5 |issue=6 |pages=198-211 |url=https://ssrn.com/abstract=603221 |language=en}} {{open access}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.google.com/patents/US4259444 Chakrabarty - U.S. Patent No. 4,259,444]&lt;/ref&gt;  While not commercially important,&lt;ref name=Rimmer/&gt; this patent and the Supreme Court case "opened the floodgates for protection of biotechnology-related inventions and helped spark the growth of an industry."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Robinson |first1=Douglas |last2=Medlock |first2=Nina |title=Diamond v.

In 1978 [[University of California]] filed a patent application for the cDNA encoding [[human growth hormone]], which issued in 1982 as U.S. Patent No. 4,363,877 and listed Howard M. Goodman, John Shine, and Peter H. Seeburg as inventors.&lt;ref name=Rimmer /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.google.com/patents/US4363877 U.S. Patent No. 4,363,877]&lt;/ref&gt;  University of California licensed its patent to [[Eli Lilly and Company|Lilly]], leading to extended litigation among University of California, Lilly, and Genentech; each of Lilly and [[Genentech]] had introduced recombinant human growth hormone drugs, which were among the first biotech drugs brought to market.&lt;ref name=Rimmer /&gt;

The "Cohen/Boyer patents" were invented by [[Stanley Norman Cohen|Stanley Cohen]] of [[Stanford University]] and [[Herbert Boyer]] of [[University of California, San Francisco]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.google.com/patents/US4237224 U.S. Patent No. 4,237,224]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.google.com/patents/US4468464 U.S. Patent No. 4,468,464]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.google.com/patents/US4740470 U.S. Patent No. 4,740,470]&lt;/ref&gt;  The patents cover inventions for splicing genes to make [[recombinant proteins]] that are foundational to the biotechnology industry.&lt;ref name=IPHandbook&gt;Feldman MP, A Colaianni and C Liu. 2007.

===Myriad Genetics case===
{{Main article|Association for Molecular Pathology v. Myriad Genetics}}

''[[Association for Molecular Pathology v. Myriad Genetics]]'' was a 2013 case challenging the [[Patentable subject matter|validity]] of [[gene patent]]s in the United States, specifically challenging certain claims in issued [[patent]]s owned or controlled by [[Myriad Genetics]] that covered [[DNA extraction|isolated DNA]] sequences, methods to diagnose propensity to cancer by looking for mutated [[DNA]] sequences, and methods to identify drugs using isolated DNA sequences.

The case was originally heard in the [[United States District Court for the Southern District of New York]], which ruled that all the challenged claims were not [[patentable subject matter]]. Myriad then appealed to the [[United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit]]. The Circuit court overturned the previous decision in part, ruling that isolated DNA which does not exist alone in nature ''can'' be patented and that the drug screening claims were valid, and confirmed in part, finding the diagnostic claims unpatentable. The plaintiffs appealed to the Supreme Court, which granted cert and remanded the case back to the Federal Circuit.  The Federal Circuit did not change its opinion, so on September 25, 2012, the [[American Civil Liberties Union]] and the [[Public Patent Foundation]] filed a petition for [[certiorari]] with the Supreme Court with respect to the second Federal Circuit Decision.

On November 30, 2012, the [[Supreme Court of the United States|Supreme Court]] agreed to hear the plaintiffs' appeal of the Federal Circuit's ruling.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Supreme Court Grants Myriad’s Petition for Cert.  |url=http://www.natlawreview.com/article/supreme-court-grants-myriad-s-petition-cert|publisher=Schwegman, Lundberg &amp; Woessner, P.A. |work=The National Law Review|date=December 3, 2012|accessdate=December 5, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; In June 2013, in ''Association for Molecular Pathology v. Myriad Genetics'' (No. 12-398), the court unanimously ruled that, "A naturally occurring DNA segment is a product of nature and not patent eligible merely because it has been isolated," invalidating Myriad's patents on the BRCA1 and BRCA2 genes. However, the Court also held synthesized DNA sequences, not occurring in nature, can still be eligible for patent protection.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Liptak|first=Adam|title=Supreme Court Rules Human Genes May Not Be Patented|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2013/06/14/us/supreme-court-rules-human-genes-may-not-be-patented.html?_r=0|accessdate=13 June 2013|newspaper=New York Times|date=13 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.cbsnews.com/8301-250_162-57589140/supreme-court-says-human-genes-cannot-be-patented/ |title=Supreme Court says human genes cannot be patented |author=Associated Press |publisher=CBS News |accessdate=June 13, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Controversy==
Controversy over biological patents occurs on many levels, driven by, for example, concern over the expense of patented medicines or diagnostics tests&lt;ref&gt;See for example 2009-2010 [http://dockets.justia.com/docket/new-york/nysdce/1:2009cv04515/345544/ litigation]&lt;/ref&gt; (against [[Myriad Genetics]] with respect to their breast cancer diagnostic test), concerns over genetically modified food which comes from patented genetically modified seeds as well as farmer's rights to harvest and plant seeds from the crops, for example legal actions by [[Monsanto]] using its patents.

The patenting of organisms or extracts from indigenous plants or animals that are already known to local populations has been called [[biopiracy]]. Critics say that such patents deny local populations the right to use those inventions, for instance, to grow food.&lt;ref name="pt"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://pib.nic.in/release/release.asp?relid=61511|title=Known Instances of Patenting on the UES of Medicinal Plants in India|date=May 6, 2010|publisher=PIB, Ministry of Environment and Forests|accessdate=21 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the United States, biological material derived from humans can be patented if it has been sufficiently transformed.  In litigation that was famous at the time, a cancer patient, [[John Moore (patent)|John Moore]], sued the University of California.  Cancer cells had been removed from Moore as part of his medical treatment; these cells were studied and manipulated by researchers.  The resulting cells were [[Biological immortality|"immortalized"]] and were patented by the university as  {{US patent|4438032}} and have become widely used research tools.    The subject of the litigation was the financial gain that the university and researchers achieved by additionally charging money to companies by licensing the cell line.

[[Michael Heller (law professor)|Michael Heller]] and [[Rebecca Eisenberg]] are academic law professors who believe that biological patents are creating a "[[tragedy of the anticommons]]," "in which people underuse scarce resources because too many owners can block each other."&lt;ref name=science&gt;{{cite journal |last=Heller |first=M. A. |last2=Eisenberg |first2=R. |title=Can Patents Deter Innovation?

Professional societies of [[pathologists]] have criticized patents on disease genes and exclusive licenses to perform DNA diagnostic tests.  In the 2009 Myriad case, doctors and pathologists complained that the patent on [[BRCA1]] and [[BRCA2]] genes prevented patients from receiving second opinions on their test results. Pathologists complained that the patent prevented them from carrying out their medical practice of doing diagnostic tests on patient samples and interpreting the results.&lt;ref name=Sweet&gt;{{cite news|title=Association For Molecular Pathology, et al.,  vs. United States Patent  and Trademark Office, et al. |date=March 29, 2010  |url=http://graphics8.nytimes.com/packages/pdf/national/20100329_patent_opinion.pdf|format=PDF|work=The New York Times|accessdate=March 30, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another example is a series of lawsuits filed by the Alzheimer’s Institute of America (AIA) starting in 2003 with the last ending in 2013, concerning a gene patent it controlled on the [[Swedish mutation]] and [[transgenic mice]] carrying it; the mutation that is important in Alzheimers. The mice are widely used in Alzheimer's research, both by academic scientists doing basic research and by companies that use the mice to test products in development. Two of these suits are directed to companies that were started based on inventions made at universities (Comentis and Avid), and in each of those cases, the university was sued along with the company. While none of the suits target universities that are conducting basic research using the mice, one of the suits is against [[Jackson Laboratory|Jackson Labs]], a nonprofit company that provides transgenic mice to academic and commercial researchers and is an important repository of such mice.  Ultimately all the suits failed; the suit against Jackson Labs failed after the NIH granted it protection as a government contractor.&lt;ref name=Trolled&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Bubela |first1=T |last2=Vishnubhakat |first2=S |last3=Cook-Deegan |first3=R |title=The Mouse That Trolled: The Long and Tortuous History of a Gene Mutation Patent That Became an Expensive Impediment to Alzheimer's Research. |journal=Journal of law and the biosciences |date=July 2015 |volume=2 |issue=2 |pages=213-262 |doi=10.1093/jlb/lsv011 |pmid=26594384 |pmc=4650893}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nature.com/news/2011/110405/full/472020a.html Patent dispute threatens US Alzheimer's research; Lawsuit could expose hundreds of scientists to property-rights litigation.] Erika Check Hayden, 5 April 2011, ''Nature'' 472, 20 (2011) | {{doi|10.1038/472020a}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While there is some controversy concerning the patenting of isolated genes and the way those patents are used, and there is controversy concerning patents on the diagnostic uses of genes (the real source of dispute in the Myriad court case), it is difficult to find controversy surrounding patents on genes that are used to manufacture therapeutic proteins (for an example of patents on therapeutic proteins, the drug candidate that is the subject of the early part of the movie '[[Extraordinary Measures]]' was covered in part by a classic gene patent, U.S. Patent No. 6,770,468.[http://patft1.uspto.gov/netacgi/nph-Parser?patentnumber=6770468]) There is also little controversy concerning the role of gene patents in the chemical industry—for instance in the manufacture of enzymes used in consumer products or industrial processes.&lt;ref&gt;New Zealand Institute of Chemistry [http://nzic.org.nz/ChemProcesses/biotech/12H.pdf Biocatalysis: Industrial Enzymes And The Exploitation Of Micro-Organisms ]&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10386">'''Bisexual politics''' are arguments surrounding individuals who identify as [[bisexual]] and their perspectives on issues involving sexuality, equality, visibility and inclusion. Some authors describe "bisexual politics" as a form of [[identity politics]].
One form of activism within ''bisexual politics'' includes the addition of the word ''bisexual'' onto lesbian and gay organisations (such as the acronym [[LGBT|LGB]]) and fighting employment discrimination for bisexual individuals.&lt;ref&gt;Morfis, 1996&lt;/ref&gt; However, the political issues as well as the position of bisexuals on these issues are considerably more complex.{{cn|date=January 2015}}

== Criticism ==
[[New York University School of Law]] professor [[Kenji Yoshino]] says:
&lt;blockquote&gt;Gays de-legitimatize bisexuals ... the lesbian and gay community abounds with negative images of bisexuals as fence-sitters, traitors, cop-outs, closet cases, people whose primary goal in life is to retain 'heterosexual privilege'.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Yoshino|first1=Kenji|title=The Epistemic Contract of Bisexual Erasure|journal=Stanford Law Review|date=January 2000|volume=52|issue=2|page=399|doi=10.2307/1229482}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
There is an underlying fear that including bisexuals as members in gay rights movements may hurt the movement, either because it is believed that bisexuals "enjoy heterosexual privilege",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Eisner|first1=Shiri|date=2 July 2013|title=Bi: Notes for a Bisexual Revolution|isbn=1-58005-475-7|page=46|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=CbJaZIosLwQC&amp;pg=PT46|accessdate=31 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; that they had less to lose than lesbian women or gay men,&lt;ref name=glbtq&gt;{{cite web|title=Bisexual Movements|url=http://www.glbtq.com/social-sciences/bisex_movements.html|website=glbtq.com|publisher=glbtq: an encyclopedia of lesbian, gay, transgender &amp; queer culture|accessdate=31 January 2015|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150301183013/http://www.glbtq.com/social-sciences/bisex_movements.html|archivedate=1 March 2015|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; or because their presence lessens the solidarity among gay and lesbian groups in some way. Rather than fence sitters, bisexuals are at further risk for [[marginalization]] because they can be ostracized by both straight and gay communities. Writers on [[bisexuality]] recognize this danger however, as sociologist Amanda Udis-Kessler, puts it, "We are not fence-sitters. Let us strive to be bridge-builders".&lt;ref name="Clarke, 1991" /&gt; These concerns are recognized by Lisa Orlando author of ''Loving whom we choose'', who writes:
&lt;blockquote&gt;We challenge many people's personal sense of what constitutes sexual identity. Whether we threaten by introducing a third category or by undermining the notion of categories altogether, we cause enough discomfort that many people deny our existence.&lt;ref name="Clarke, 1991"&gt;Clarke, 1991&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
Thus, bisexual politics involve, among other issues, the debate over inclusion in both gay and straight movements and cultures.

== Issues ==

=== Identity ===

The problem of identity centers upon whether bisexuals build an identity around their bisexuality, what being a bisexual means socially, and how it relates to other identities such as [[feminism]].{{cn|date=January 2015}} One debate is whether or not it is valuable to establish bisexuality as a sexual identity. As author Jennifer Baumgardner writes:
&lt;blockquote&gt;It is feminist to understand bisexuality as its own identity too, because it's a chapter of women's history that has been repressed and misunderstood, and one that has contributed substantially to current ideas about queerness&lt;ref name="Baumgardner, 2008"&gt;Baumgardner, 2008&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
However the author recognizes that there are also political limitations to identifying as bisexual, saying that:
&lt;blockquote&gt;The thing about being bisexual is that you don't really have to be out in the same ways. You can often pass for straight. This can be a weak position politically – how can we organize people around gay rights if we don't identify, and can't be identified by others, as gay?&lt;ref name="Baumgardner, 2008" /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
Out of this debate, a variety of identity terms have expanded to include the many ideas surrounding this complex issue of identity and sexuality including, ''[[pansexuality]]'' (''omnisexuality''), ''[[polysexuality]]'', and just "being sexual".{{cn|date=January 2015}}

=== Entitlement ===
Among some critics, a belief is held that bisexual politics is important to equal rights on the basis of ''entitlement''. The term ''entitlement'' here refers specifically to the belief that a bisexual can be and are viewed as straight in some public spheres and thus enjoy the  benefits of equality that come along with "assumed heterosexuality."&lt;ref name="Baumgardner, 2008" /&gt; Baumgardner recognizes this view and writes:
&lt;blockquote&gt;Bisexuality [...] contains the liberating potential of aligning with a disparaged (gay and lesbian) group but not being relegated – at least not full-time – to the ghetto. This is the political value of what is called, negatively, entitlement. The political weakness of entitlement (lack of consciousness) have been overstated – as with young feminists – and its potential for change has been neglected [...] Perhaps we need those bridging people on the side of privilege willing to connect the gay and straight worlds- in order to get more done [...] It takes someone who has known relative freedom, who expects it and loves it, to help ignite social change&lt;ref name="Baumgardner, 2008" /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

=== Visibility ===
Bisexual politics also involves the arguments surrounding how visible a minority of bisexuals are in society, and how this interacts bisexual activism. It has been said that bisexuals can identify between groups at different times. For example the question, "When a female bisexual is in a relationship with a man does she cease to become bisexual and alternatively heterosexual?" and also, "When the bisexual female abandons her male partner for a female one, can that individual identify as homosexual?" This belief can lead to issues of visibility in that, a bisexual person may identify with either sexual orientation or alternatively, with neither. Another aspect of this debate is whether bisexuals should operate as visible minorities distinct from homosexuals.{{cn|date=January 2015}} As Lani Kaahumanu writes, "So, why does the attitude exist that there is no bisexual community, and why has it been used against us so effectively? Why have we 'accepted' invisibility, and why haven't we, up to this point, projected a more visible presence, creating a more prominent community that even the most virulent biphobes would have to recognize?"&lt;ref name="Clarke, 1991" /&gt;

=== Inclusion ===
Inclusion is a main issue with regard to bisexual politics as this group is at risk of being viewed as homosexual by heterosexual groups, and also as "traitors" or closeted by the gay and lesbian communities. Lesbian and gay organizations all over the country hotly debate whether or not to include bisexuals in programming and names of groups and events.&lt;ref name="Clarke, 1991" /&gt;  Author Naiomi Tucker argues:
&lt;blockquote&gt;Bisexuality can be a unifying force in the world. But we must avoid the mistakes of some of our lesbian sisters who profess sexual acceptance [...] [while they] invalidate bisexuality as an orientation [...] If we claim self-definition for ourselves, then we must accord that right to others [...] As a bisexual movement we can create a community where it is safe for everyone to comfortably express their sexuality. As well, a quote from collection of bisexual testimonials puts the issue poignantly "I very much resented the smugness of lesbians who said my evolution was incomplete [...] Although I understand sexual politics, I could no sooner change my sexual orientation, nor would I want to, any more than a lesbian could.&lt;ref name="Clarke, 1991" /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
Inclusion continues to be an issue in bisexual politics, and specifically whether bisexuals represent an additional minority or rather a merging of opposing heterosexual and homosexual groups. Thus bisexual politics considers how bisexuals may offer a bridge by which individuals can reconcile differences and be a positive force in human rights.

There has been much debate over how to include bisexuality into LGBT communities. Much of this involves the invisibility of the bisexual community. Many people do not fully understand bisexuality. Many members of the bisexual community tend to gravitate more toward either the heterosexual or gay communities. This has led to difficulty in creating visibility for bisexuality because western culture has created a binary of heterosexual or gay, with very few people choosing to live in both communities.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;id=cnmMCgAAQBAJ&amp;oi=fnd&amp;pg=PA149&amp;dq=bisexual+politics&amp;ots=2PUPrc7cXa&amp;sig=4YXkmOJk8tDgjD10eNJablf0AVM#v=onepage&amp;q=bisexual%20politics&amp;f=false|title=The Ashgate Research Companion to Lesbian and Gay Activism|last=Tremblay|first=Professor Manon|last2=Paternotte|first2=Dr David|date=2015-09-28|publisher=Ashgate Publishing, Ltd.|isbn=9781409457091|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''The Burial Laws Amendment Act 1880''' (43 &amp; 44 Vict c 41) is an [[Acts of Parliament in the United Kingdom|Act]] of the [[Parliament of the United Kingdom]]. It is one of the [[Burial Acts 1852 to 1885]].&lt;ref&gt;The [[Short Titles Act 1896]], section 2(1) and Schedule 2&lt;/ref&gt;

This Act is excluded by [http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/Geo6/8-9/27/section/4 section 4] of the [[Welsh Church (Burial Grounds) Act 1945]].

For the construction of references in this Act to a "parish" or "burial board", in the application of this Act to [[Greater London]], see [http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1963/33/section/44 section 44(4)] of the [[London Government Act 1963]].

From 1882 to 1961, this Act was applied by section 3 of the [[Interments (felo de se) Act 1882]].

==Preamble==
The preamble was repealed by the [[Statute Law Revision Act 1894]].

==Section 7 - Burials to be conducted in a decent and orderly manner and without obstruction==
This section reads:

{{Blockquote|All burials under this Act, whether with or without a religious service, shall be conducted in a decent and orderly manner; and every person guilty of any riotous, violent, or indecent behaviour at any burial under this Act, or wilfully obstructing such burial or any such service as aforesaid thereat, or who shall, in any such churchyard or graveyard as aforesaid, deliver any address, not being part of or incidental to a religious service permitted by this Act, and not otherwise permitted by any lawful authority, or who shall, under colour of any religious service or otherwise, in any such churchyard or graveyard, wilfully endeavour to bring into contempt or obloquy the Christian religion, or the belief or worship of any church or denomination of Christians, or the members or any minister of any such church or denomination, or any other person, shall be guilty of a [[misdemeanor]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/Vict/43-44/41/section/7 Digitised copy of section 7] from Legislation.gov.uk&lt;/ref&gt;}}

'''"Riotous"'''

See sections 10(3) and (4) of the [[Public Order Act 1986]].

'''Sentence'''

A person guilty of this offence is liable to imprisonment for a term not exceeding two years.&lt;ref&gt;Castro v R (1880) 5 QBD 490 at 508; the [[Powers of Criminal Courts (Sentencing) Act 2000]], [http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2000/6/section/77 section 77]&lt;/ref&gt;

Where a person is convicted on indictment of this offence, the court, if not precluded from sentencing an offender by its exercise of some other power, may impose a fine instead of or in addition to dealing with him in any other way in which the court has power to deal with him, subject however to any enactment requiring the offender to be dealt with in a particular way.&lt;ref&gt;The [[Criminal Justice Act 2003]], [http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2003/44/section/163 section 163]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Proposal for repeal'''

In 1985, the [[Law Commission (England and Wales)|Law Commission]] said that this offence was no longer used and recommended that it be repealed.&lt;ref&gt;The Law Commission. Criminal Law: Offences against Religion and Public Worship. Law Com 145. HMSO. London. 1985. Paragraph 3.25 at page 39.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1981, they said that in relation to cemeteries and crematoria managed by local authorities, this offence was effectively superseded by articles 18 and 19 of the [[Local Authorities' Cemeteries Order 1977]] (SI 1977/204), made under section 214 of the [[Local Government Act 1972]].&lt;ref&gt;The Law Commission. Offences against Religion and Public Worship. Working Paper No 79. HMSO. London. 1981. Paragraphs 12.11 and 12.21 at pages 152 and 160.&lt;/ref&gt; They also said that there was a considerable overlap with the offence in section 2 of the [[Ecclesiastical Courts Jurisdiction Act 1860]].&lt;ref&gt;The Law Commission. Offences against Religion and Public Worship. Working Paper No 79. HMSO. London. 1981. Paragraph 12.13 at page 154.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Section 11 - Order of coroner or certificate of registrar to be delivered to relative, etc instead of to person who buries==
This section was repealed by [http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/Geo5/16-17/48/section/13/enacted section 13(1)] of, and [http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/Geo5/16-17/48/schedule/SECOND/enacted Second Schedule] to, the [[Births and Deaths Registration Act 1926]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2175">The '''Child Pornography Prevention Act of 1996''' (CPPA) was a [[United States]] federal law to restrict [[child pornography]] on the [[internet]], including [[Simulated child pornography|virtual child pornography]].

Before 1996, Congress defined child pornography with reference to the ''Ferber'' standard.  In ''[[New York v. Ferber]]'', {{ussc|458|747|1982}}, the [[Supreme Court of the United States|Supreme Court]] held that the government could restrict the distribution of child pornography to protect children from the [[child sexual abuse]] harm inherent in making it.  In ''[[Osborne v. Ohio]]'', {{ussc|495|103|1990}}, the ''Ferber'' proscription was extended by the Court to the mere possession of child pornography.

The Child Pornography Prevention Act added two categories of speech to the definition of child pornography.  The first prohibited "any visual depiction, including any [[photograph]], [[film]], [[video]], [[picture]], or computer or [[computer-generated image]] or picture" that "is, or appears to be, of a [[minor (law)|minor]] engaging in sexually explicit conduct."  In Ashcroft case, the Court observed that this provision "captures a range of depictions, sometimes called 'virtual child pornography,' which include computer-generated images, as well as images produced by more traditional means."

The second prohibited "any sexually explicit image that was advertised, promoted, presented, described, or distributed in such a manner that conveys the impression it depicts a minor engaging in sexually explicit conduct."

The Supreme Court struck down CPPA in 2002 in ''[[Ashcroft v. Free Speech Coalition]]'' as a violation of the [[First Amendment to the United States Constitution|First Amendment]] for being too broad.

'''''The City of [[Gotha]] and [[Federal Republic of Germany]] v. [[Sotheby's]] and Cobert Finance S.A.''''' was a September 1998 case in the [[High Court of England and Wales]] involving the ownership of a [[Joachim Wtewael]] painting. The case was the first reported court decision on section 221 of the German Civil Code ([[Burgerliches Gesetzbuch]]). This section involves the limitation of proprietary actions when a third party has acquired possession of the property.&lt;ref&gt;''City of Gotha and Federal Republic of Germany v. Sotheby's and Cobert Finance S.A.'' [Gotha]&lt;/ref&gt; The case is important in regards to the concepts of statutes of limitation and acquisitive [[Custom (law)|prescription]].&lt;ref&gt;Muller-Katzenburg, "Possession and Ownership of Stolen or Otherwise Lost Works of Art" in Prott, Lyndel V.,eds, ''Witnesses to History: A Compendium of Documents and Writings on the Return of Cultural Objects ''(Paris: United Nations Educational, Scientific, and Cultural Organization, 2009) at 315.

==Procedural History==

The case was a consolidation between an action brought by the City of Gotha against Sotheby's and an action brought by Federal Republic of Germany against Cobert Finance S.A.&lt;ref&gt;Supra note 1[Gotha]&lt;/ref&gt;
The Federal Republic of Germany and the city of Gotha both claim ownership of the painting and claim that Cobert converted the painting by "taking constructive delivery of it March 1989, by consigning it to Sotheby's for sale at that time, by offering it for sale through Sotheby's to the City of Gotha in October 1991 and/or by demanding its return from Sotheby's in August 1993".&lt;ref&gt;Ibid&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==

The Duke Family of [[Saxe-Coburg-Gotha]] began to buy paintings in 1656. The Joachim Wtewael painting The ''Holy Family with Saints John and Elizabeth'', the painting involved in the case, was featured in an 1826 catalogue of the family's paintings. In July 1905 an act was created declaring that the art collection was part of the estate of the Duke. On 9 November 1918 the workers' and soldiers' council of Gotha deposed of the Duke and the estate was voluntarily dissolved. In November 1927, by an agreement between the Duke and Land of Thuringia the Duke of Saxe-Coburg-Gotha, the Foundation for Art and Science (Art Foundation) was created with the purpose of preserving the art collection. The most valuable pieces of the Art Foundation were moved to safety at Reinharsbrunn at the start of the [[Second World War]].

[[File:German Empire - Saxe Coburg and Gotha (1871).svg|thumbnail|left|Saxe-Coburg Gotha]]

==History of the Painting Relevant to the Case==

After the Second World War, the painting left the collection of the Ducal Family of Saxe-Coburg-Gotha in the city of Gotha. In the 1980s, the painting was arranged to be sold by two art smugglers, Makhin and Greshnikov, to a man named Furst. They arranged the smuggling of the painting from Moscow to West Berlin by Mrs. Dikeni, the wife of the Togo Ambassador in Moscow. She was supposed to deliver the painting to Furst, but did not; and it ended up in the hands of a man named Rohde. The painting was then acquired by Mina Breslav in 1988 and received by Sotheby's on 29 November 1988. The painting was offered for sale and bought by Cobert in March 1989.

==Issues in the Case==

1. Whether the Federal Republic of Germany can establish title to the painting and
[[File:Deutschland Lage von Thüringen.svg|thumbnail|right|Region of Thuringia]]
2. Whether if it can, its claim is time-barred under the German law of limitation

For the first question to be answered it is needed to find:

1.1 Whether as a matter of fact, it can be established that the painting was in [[Thuringia]] in 1945 and 1946;

1.2 Whether title to the painting passed to the Land of Thuringia by virtue of the confiscation police order of 6 July 1945, read with the 
expropriation Law of 9 October 1945 or, if the painting was still in Thuringia in July 1946, by the operation of the Law of 24 July 1946;

1.3 Whether title to the painting passed to the Land of Thuringia by virtue of the dissolution of the Art Foundation on 14 October 1950;

1.4 Whether an English Court will recognize or enforce the Federal Republic of Germany's title to the painting under German law;

1.5 Whether the arrival of the painting in [[West Berlin]], allegedly via [[East Germany]] in 1987 perfects an inchoate expropriation;

1.6 Whether the City of Gotha has a right to possession of the painting.

For the second question to be answered it is needed to find:

2.1 Whether as a matter of fact the painting was misappropriated by a subsequent possessor after it had been stolen from Gotha;

2.2 Whether the German limitation period is relevant pursuant to Section 1 of the Foreign Limitation Periods Act 1984;

2.3 Whether, if German law is relevant, the right to recover is statute-barred under German law;

2.4 Whether pursuant to Section 2 (1) of the Foreign Limitation Periods Act 1984, the judge should disapply German law, if it bars the claim, on the grounds that it conflicts with English public policy.

===1.1 The Location of the Painting in 1945 and 1946===

To establish ownership of the painting, it is necessary to rely on laws which only had effect within the region of Thuringia or other territory that the [[Soviet]] Military Administration had jurisdiction over. The judge found that the most likely time that the painting was taken, was during the Soviet trophy brigades under Major Alexeyev, when the brigades raided the museum in January 1946. By July 1946 it was confirmed that the painting was gone.

===1.2 Approach to Foreign Law===

====Law Applicable to the Transfer of Title to the Painting====

The judge found that he was required to apply German domestic law as "the validity of a transfer of a tangible, movable"&lt;ref&gt;Ibid&lt;/ref&gt; piece of property is governed by the law of the country where it is transferred. He stated that the Federal Republic of Germany had to establish title under German law.

====Title to the Painting under German Law====

The determination of title is established by legislation passed between July 1945 to July 1946. This legislation concerns [[confiscation]], [[wikt:sequester|sequestration]] and [[expropriation]] of property within the area. It is only laws relating to expropriation which have the effect of depriving an owner of title.

=====Law of 6 July 1945=====

The law of 6 July 1945 confiscated the assets of the house of Saxe-Coburg-Gotha. The judge found this law to be legally effective.

=====Law of 9 October 1945=====

The Law of 9 October 1945 expropriated the assets of Art Foundation of Saxe-Coburg-Gotha which had been confiscated by the 6 July 1945 law.

=====Order No. 124 and Order No. 38=====

Order No. 124 and Order No. 38, passed in 4 December 1945 and 24 July 1946, stated that the law of 9 October 1945 was repealed.

=====Was the Expropriation by the Law of 9 October 1945 Repealed by the Law of 4 December 1945?=====

The judge found that the expropriation of the paintings remained effective. He found that the Law of December 1945 replaced the regime previously existing under the law but did not repeal confiscations carried out before the law of October 1945.

=====Order No. 154/181 and Order No. 38=====

Sequestered and confiscated property belonging to the [[Nazi]] party and put the assets under the authority of German administrative authorities. The orders expropriated property covered by Order No. 124 and required their delivery to the state of Thuringia.

====Judge's Finding on Laws====

The Judge found that if the painting was still in the jurisdiction of the Soviet military administration in July 1946 the law of July 1946 would have expropriated the paintng.

===1.3 Dissolution of the Foundation on 14 October 1950===

The Minister of Justice of Thuringia attempted to dissolve the Saxe-Coburg-Gotha Art Foundation on 14 October 1950.

====Was the Dissolution Effective to Transfer Title to the Painting to the Land?====

Article 87 (1) of the German Civil Code states that "if the fulfillment of the object of the foundation has become impossible, or if it endangers the public interest, the competent authority may give the foundation another stated object or dissolve it". Article 88 states that on the dissolution of a foundation, the assets pass to the person specified in the constitution. The Constitution of the foundation did not specify a beneficiary. This led to claims that the failure to specify a beneficiary and the absence of a reference to the board of directors confirmed that the dissolution of the foundation was an act of expropriation.

====Did the Property of the Art Foundation Including the Painting Situated then in the [[Soviet Union]] pass to the Land Thuringia?====

The judge found that the dissolution of the foundation did not amount to an act of expropriation.

====Judge's Conclusions on the Dissolution====

The Judge found that the seat of the Art Foundation was in Gotha in 1950, that the Ministry of Justice of Thuringia was the competent authority to dissolve the foundation, that the dissolution was not an act of expropriation and that by [[universal succession]], title to the property of the foundation passed to the land of Thuringia.

===1.4 Recognition or enforcement in an English Court of Federal Republic of Germany's Title to the Painting under German Law===

Cobert brought forward the principle that English courts will not recognize a governmental act affecting private property rights when the property is situated outside the territory of that government; and that English courts will not enforce the "penal, revenue or other public laws of a foreign state"&lt;ref&gt;Ibid&lt;/ref&gt;

====Was the Dissolution a Governmental Act?====

The judge found that the Ministry of Justice's attempt to dissolve the Art Foundation only concerned the status of the Foundation and that English law should recognise the effects of the law.

====Is this Action an Action for the Enforcement Directly or Indirectly of a Penal Revenue or Other Public Law of a Foreign State?====

The court found that the act of dissolution only concerned the existence of the Foundation, was not an exercise of sovereign authority, and therefore could be recognized under English law.

===1.5 Return of the Painting to the German Democratic Republic in 1987===

The Federal German Republic contended that the painting would have entered the German Democratic Republic in 1987 on its way to West Berlin. The judge found as there was no evidence relating to how the painting entered West Berlin, this was irrelevant.

===1.6 City of Gotha's Claim to Possession===

The Judge found that the city of Gotha had no claim to possession; and if the Federal German Republic's claim had failed, the city's claim would fail as well. The location of the painting within Gotha does not establish a legal right of the city for possession. The only legal claim to possession would be the assignment of the museum to the city in 1952, but the painting had left the city earlier than that date.

===Answer to First Question===

The court found that the Federal German Republic had title to the painting.

===2.1 Facts Relating to Limitation; the Arrival of the Painting in West Berlin from Moscow, 1987-1989===

There was an issue of whether the painting had been misappropriated by Mrs. Dikeni or Rohde.

====Finding of Fact as to Misappropriation====

The judge looked at various witness testimonies, but questioned their credibility do to their involvement in criminal activities. The judge found that after the painting was given to Mrs. Dikeni, it was not returned; and that Mrs. Dikeni misappropriated the painting in 1987.

===2.2 Is the German Limitation Period Relevant?===

The period of limitation only starts when the painting is purchased in good faith

The Foreign Limitations Periods Act 1984 Section 1 states:

(1) Subject to the following provisions of this Act, where in any action or proceedings in a court in England and Wales, the law of any other country falls to be taken into account in the determination of any matter

a) the law of that other country relating to limitation shall apply in respect of that matter for the purposes of the action or proceedings; and

b)except where the matter falls within subsection (2) below, the law of England and Wales relating to limitation shall not so apply

(2) A matter falls within this subsection if it is a matter in the determination of which both the law of England and Wales and the law of some other country fall to be taken into account&lt;ref&gt;Ibid&lt;/ref&gt;

The judge found that the laws of both Germany and England are applicable and Section 1 (2) of the Act applies.

===2.3 Limitation under German Law===

The judge found that under German law:

* the right to recovery is statute-barred after a period of thirty years
* no title is transferred to the person in possession by the expiry of the limitation period of thirty years
* the limitation period begins when the claim arises
* the thirty-year period continued to apply even when the painting was outside Germany, within the Soviet Union
* time runs irrespective of whether the claimant is aware of the existence of the claim or the identity of his opponent
* a new claim for recovery arises against each new possessor&lt;ref&gt;Ibid&lt;/ref&gt;

The contention depends on article 221 of the German Civil Code which states:

If a thing, with regard to which a claim in rem exists, comes by succession into the possession of a third party, the time of prescription which elapsed during the time of possession by the predecessor in title is reckoned in favor of the successor in title&lt;ref&gt;Ibid&lt;/ref&gt;

If article 221 is applicable, the last possessor gains all periods of limitation expired by previous possessors.

Professor Siehr alleged that the 30 year limitation period had not expired because

1 Article 221 does not apply to a transfer between a [[bailor]] to a [[bailee]]; and

2 Article 221 does not have effect where a direct possessor misappropriates the asset&lt;ref&gt;Ibid&lt;/ref&gt;

====The Application of Article 221 to a Transfer from Bailor to Bailee====

A bailee is someone in direct possession, and a bailor after possession is in indirect possession. The judge found that both bailee and bailor could rely upon the limitation period.

====Subsequent Misappropriation by the Succeeding Possessor====

The judge found that if a bailee misappropriates an asset the limitation period which had elapsed is restarted, as the chain of non-proprietary possession has been broken. He found that the limitation period started to run when Mrs. Dikeni misappropriated the painting in 1987 or by Rohde later that year.

===2.4 Public policy===

The judge found that if the claim had been barred under German law, it would have been imperative to examine whether this conflicted with English public policy.&lt;ref&gt;Ibid&lt;/ref&gt; The judge found that there was a policy that time was not to run in favor of the thief or a transferee who did not purchase the painting in good faith.&lt;ref&gt;O'Keefe, Patrick. "Using UNIDROIT to avoid Cultural Heritage Disputes: Limitation Periods" (2006) at 241.[O'Keefe]&lt;/ref&gt; He also found that there was no public policy which would deprive the Federal Republic of Germany of the benefits of the German limitation laws; and that this could not be done simply because the application of English laws would lead to different results.&lt;ref&gt;Supra note 1 [Gotha]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Answer to Second Question===

The judge found that the German limitation period of 30 years had not expired at the time of the claim.&lt;ref&gt;Supra note 12 [O'Keefe]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Judge's Findings==

1.1 The painting was taken from Thuringia in January 1946;

1.2 Title passed to the land Thuringia by virtue of the law of 9 October 1945, the expropriatary effect of which was not repealed by the law of 4 December 1945

1.3 Had not title passed in 1945 it would have passed to the land by virtue of the dissolution of the Art Foundation 14 October 1950

1.4 English Courts will recognize and enforce the Federal Republic of Germany's title to the painting, whether derived from the law of October 1945 or the dissolution in 1950

1.5 It has not been proved that the painting entered the territory of the German Democratic Republic in 1987

1.6 The city of Gotha cannot claim possession of the painting

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1249">The '''Civil Jurisdiction and Judgments Act 1991''' is an [[Act of Parliament]] made by the [[Parliament of the United Kingdom]] in order to implement the [[Brussels Regime|Lugano Convention]] of 1988 into British law.

==Contracting states in 1991==
In addition to the contracting states to the Brussels Convention over which the [[Civil Jurisdiction and Judgments Act 1982]] gave the UK courts jurisdiction, the contracting states to the Lugano Convention were the members of the [[European Free Trade Association]] who were not members of the [[European Economic Community]] (now [[European Union]]); namely [[Austria]], [[Finland]], [[Iceland]], [[Norway]], [[Sweden]] and [[Switzerland]]. [[Poland]] became a contracting state when it signed the Lugano Convention in 2000.

The '''Convention on the Conservation of Antarctic Marine Living Resources''',  also '''Commission for the Conservation of Antarctic Marine Living Resources''', and ''' CCAMLR''',  is part of the [[Antarctic Treaty System]]. The Convention was opened for signature on 1 August 1980 and entered into force on 7 April 1982 by the Commission for the Conservation of Antarctic Marine Living Resources, headquartered in [[Tasmania]], [[Australia]]. The goal is to preserve [[marine life]] and environmental integrity in and near [[Antarctica]].

It was established in large part to concerns that an increase in [[krill]] catches in the [[Southern Ocean]] could have a serious impact on populations of other marine life which are dependent upon krill for food.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.ccamlr.org/ |title=Commission for the Conservation of Antarctic Marine Living Resources  |work=ccamlr.org |year=2011 |accessdate=11 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1989, CCAMLR set up the [[Convention on the Conservation of Antarctic Marine Living Resources Ecosystem Monitoring Program|Ecosystem Monitoring Program]] (CEMP) to further monitor the effects of fishing and harvesting of species in the area.

In July 2013, the CCAMLR held a meeting in [[Bremerhaven]] in Germany, to decide whether to turn the Ross Sea into an MPA (Marine Protected Area). The deal failed due to Russia voting against it, citing uncertainty about whether the commission had the authority to establish a marine protected area.&lt;ref&gt;[[New Scientist]], No. 2926, 20 July, "Fight to preserve last pristine ecosystem fails"&lt;/ref&gt;

On 28 October 2016 at its annual meeting in [[Hobart]], a [[Ross Sea]] marine park was finally declared by the CCAMLR, under an agreement signed by 24 countries and the [[European Union]]. It protects over 1.5 million square kilometres of sea, and is the world's largest.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="12174">The '''Convention on the Nationality of Married Women''' is an international convention passed by the United Nations General Assembly in 1957. It entered into force in 1958 and as of 2013 it has 74 state parties.

==Background==
Before the ''Convention on the Nationality of Married Women'', no legislation existed to protect married women's right to retain or renounce national citizenship in the way that men could. Women's rights groups recognized a need to legally protect the citizenship rights of women who married someone from outside their country or nationality. The [[League of Nations]], the international organization later succeeded by the [[United Nations]], was lobbied by women's rights groups during the early 20th century to address the lack of international laws recognizing married women's rights of national citizenship. The [[Conference for the Codification of International Law]], held at [[The Hague]] in 1930, drew protests from international women's rights groups, yet the League declined to include legislation enforcing married women's nationality rights. The League took the position that it was not their role, but the role of member states, to deal with equality between men and women.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Berkovitch|first=Nitza|title=From Motherhood to Citizenship: Women's Rights and International Organizations|year=1999|publisher=JHU Press|isbn=9780801860287|pages=80}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The International Women's Suffrage Alliance (IWSA, later renamed the [[International Alliance of Women]]) launched a telegram campaign in 1931 to pressure the League of Nations to address the lack of legislation. Women from around the world sent telegrams to the League of Nations as a protest. The League made the concession of creating an unfunded Consultative Committee on Nationality of Women.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Berkovitch|first=Nitza|title=From Motherhood to Citizenship: Women's Rights and International Organizations|year=1999|publisher=JHU Press|isbn=9780801860287|pages=80}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Pan-American Conference]] in [[Montevideo]] passed a ''[[Convention on the Nationality of Women]]'' in 1933.&lt;ref name="umn.edu/"&gt;{{cite web|title=Convention on the Nationality of Women, O.A.S. Treaty Series No. 4, 38, entered into force Aug. 29, 1934|url=https://www1.umn.edu/humanrts/instree/uruguay1933.html|publisher=University of Minnesota Human Rights Library|accessdate=28 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was passed by the Pan American Conference at the same time as the ''Treaty on the Equality of Rights Between Men and Women''. These were the first pieces of international law to "explicitly set sexual equality as a principle to be incorporated into national legislation"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Berkovitch|first=Nitza|title=From Motherhood to Citizenship: Women's Rights and International Organizations|year=1999|publisher=JHU Press|isbn=9780801860287|pages=81}}&lt;/ref&gt; which was required of countries ratifying the convention and treaty. Lobbying by the [[American National Women's Party]] has been credited with this legislation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Berkovitch|first=Nitza|title=From Motherhood to Citizenship: Women's Rights and International Organizations|year=1999|publisher=JHU Press|isbn=9780801860287|pages=82}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, neither the [[International Labour Organization]] (ILO) nor the League of Nations passed any legislation on the issue during the interwar years.

==Entry into force==
The issue of the nationality of married women was a leading women's rights issue facing the [[United Nations]] after its establishment. The [[United Nations Commission on the Status of Women]] was created, and made it a priority of their agenda, launching a study in 1948. The Commission recommended to the United Nations Economic and Social Council that legislation be drafted to give women equal rights as set out in Article 15 of the [[Universal Declaration of Human Rights]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Joyce|first=James Avery|title=Human Rights: International Documents, Volume 1|year=1978|publisher=Brill Archive|isbn=9789028602984|pages=183}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ''Convention on the Nationality of Married Women'' entered into force on 11 August 1958.

As of 2013, the convention has been ratified by 74 states. It has been denounced by the ratifying states of [[Luxembourg]], [[Netherlands]], and [[United Kingdom]].

==Purpose==
The Convention was concluded in the light of the [[conflict of laws|conflicts of law]] on [[nationality]] derived from provisions concerning the loss or acquisition of [[nationality]] by women as a result of [[marriage]], [[divorce]], or of the change of [[nationality]] by the husband during [[marriage]]. It allows women to adopt the nationality of their husband based upon the woman's own decision, but does not require it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Kinnear|first=Karen L.|title=Women in Developing Countries: A Reference Handbook|year=2011|publisher=ABC-CLIO|isbn=9781598844252|pages=179}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Convention seeks to fulfill aspirations articulated in Article 15 of the [[Universal Declaration of Human Rights]] that 'everyone has a right to a [[nationality]]' and 'no one shall be arbitrarily deprived of his [[nationality]] nor denied the right to change his [[nationality]]'.

==Key principles==
&lt;blockquote&gt;Article 1
* Woman's [[nationality]] not to be automatically affected by [[marriage]] to an [[Alien (law)|alien]].

Article 2
* Acquisition or renunciation of a [[nationality]] by a husband not to prevent the wife's retention of her [[nationality]].

Article 3
* Specially privileged nationality procedures to be available for wives to take the nationality of their husbands.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The [[Confucius Institute]] (CI) program, which began establishing centers for Chinese language instruction in 2004, has been the subject of criticisms, concerns, and controversies during its international expansion.

Many such concerns stem from the CI's relationship to [[Chinese Communist Party]] authorities, giving rise to criticisms about undermining academic freedom at host universities, engaging in industrial and military espionage, surveillance of Chinese students abroad, and attempts to advance the Chinese government's political agendas on controversial issues such as [[human rights in China]], [[Taiwan]] and [[Tibet]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://freetibet.org/news-media/na/free-tibet-challenges-chinas-propaganda-schools Free Tibet challenges China's propaganda in schools.] ''Free Tibet''. 30 March 2015. Retrieved 31 March 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.studentsforafreetibet.org/news/campaigners-shut-down-confucius-institute5 Campaigners Shut Down Confucius Institute]. ''Students for a Free Tibet''. 29 October 2014. Retrieved 31 March 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; Additional concerns have arisen over the institutes’ financial and academic viability, teaching quality, and relations with Chinese partner universities.&lt;ref name=EJE2009&gt;Starr, Don [http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1465-3435.2008.01371.x/full "Chinese Language Education in Europe: the Confucius Institutes"], ''European Journal of Education'' (2009). Volume 44, Issue 1, pages 78–79.&lt;/ref&gt;

Confucius Institutes have defended their establishments,  comparing them with other cultural promotion organizations such as [[Alliance française]] and [[Goethe-Institut]].&lt;ref name="20110220smh"/&gt; However, unlike the Alliance francaise or Goethe-Institut, many Confucius Institutes operate directly on university campuses, thus giving rise to unique concerns related to academic freedom and political influence.&lt;ref name=ChinaU/&gt; Some observers have noted that CIs are largely limited to teaching cultural and language programs, and the institutes' staff tend to see political and controversial subjects as human rights and democracy as outside the context of the mission of a Confucius Institute.&lt;ref name=ChinaU/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ulara Nakagawa (2011), [http://the-diplomat.com/new-emissary/2011/03/07/confucius-controversy/ "Confucius Controversy"], ''[[The Diplomat]]'', 7 March 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Confucius Institute program began in 2004 and is financed by the quasi-governmental [[HanBan|Office of Chinese Language Council International]] (colloquially, ''Hanban''), which is chaired by Politburo member and Vice Premier [[Liu Yandong]], former head of the [[United Front Work Department]]. Hanban is governed by "a council of high state and party officials" drawn from a variety of [[Communist Party of China|party]] and state ministries including Foreign Affairs, Education, and the State Council Information Office (also known as the "Office of Foreign Propaganda") . Marshall Sahlins of the University of Chicago describes Hanban as "an instrument of the party state operating as an international pedagogical organization."&lt;ref name=ChinaU&gt;{{cite news|last=Sahlins|first=Marshall|title=China U.|url=http://www.thenation.com/article/176888/china-u#|accessdate=11 April 2014|newspaper=The Nation|date=29 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The institutes operate in co-operation with local affiliate colleges and universities around the world. The related Confucius Classroom program partners with secondary schools and school districts to provide Chinese language teachers and instructional materials.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Introduction to the Confucius Institutes|url=http://college.chinese.cn/en/article/2009-08/29/content_22308.htm|accessdate=2 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Jianguo Chen |author2=Chuang Wang |author3=Jinfa Cai |title=Teaching and learning Chinese: issues and perspectives|year=2010|publisher=IAP|pages=xix|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=pGURhDOkdxEC&amp;pg=PR19&amp;dq=confucius+institute&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=TLkOTsO4GqnUiAKHkpH8DQ&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=5&amp;ved=0CEsQ6AEwBA#v=onepage&amp;q=Confucius%20institute&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Confucius Institute has grown rapidly from one campus in Seoul in 2004 to more than 400 worldwide&lt;ref&gt;Confucius Institute, University of Nebraska, Lincoln [http://confuciusinstitute.unl.edu/institutes.shtml], "Confucius Institutes around the globe"&lt;/ref&gt; in 2013, and opposition to the program "has grown almost as dramatically." Critics have accused CIs of having restrictive hiring practices and "spreading propaganda" about issues such as the legitimacy of the Taiwanese state and origins of the Korean War.&lt;ref&gt;Jon Marcus, [http://www.timeshighereducation.co.uk/news/wests-universities-reconsider-china-funded-confucius-institutes/2002870.article West’s universities reconsider China-funded Confucius Institutes], ''The Times'' Higher Education, 4 April 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://dailysignal.com/2014/10/16/confucius-institutes-merely-outlets-chinese-propaganda/ Confucius Institute Under Fire as Conduit of Chinese Propaganda], ''The Daily Signal'', [[The Heritage Foundation]], 16 October 2014&lt;/ref&gt;

In evidence of the "spectacular proliferation" of CIs, Lionel Jensen notes they have become so familiar in the United States a segment of [[The Daily Show]] made a parody out of a community group's opposition to the CI teaching Mandarin in a public school.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| publisher=| title=China in and beyond the Headlines | author1= Lionel M.

==Objectives==
Confucius Institutes’ stated missions are to promote knowledge of Chinese language and culture abroad, as well as to promote commercial and trade cooperation. In the context of the Chinese Communist Party's foreign policy objectives, the institutes serve as tools of cultural diplomacy intended to bolster China's [[soft power]] abroad.

Official Communist Party literature describes the Institutes in the context of [[Hu Jintao]]’s soft power initiatives, designed to influence perceptions of China and its policies abroad. [[Li Changchun]], the 5th-highest-ranking member of the [[Politburo Standing Committee of the Communist Party of China|Politburo Standing Committee]], was quoted in ''[[The Economist]]'' saying the Institutes were "an important part of China’s overseas propaganda set-up".&lt;ref name=20091022economist&gt;[http://www.economist.com/node/14678507 A message from Confucius; New ways of projecting soft power], ''The Economist''. 22 October 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

''The Economist'' notes China "has been careful not to encourage these language centres to act as overt purveyors of the party’s political viewpoints, and little suggests they are doing so", but also noted the important goal of give the world a "correct" understanding of China, as well as efforts in opposing Chinese dissident groups abroad, such as Tibetan independent activists, democracy groups and the Falun Gong.&lt;ref&gt;The Economist, [https://www.economist.com/blogs/asiaview/2011/01/china%E2%80%99s_confucius_institutes China’s Confucius Institutes: Rectification of statues], "Asia Banyan", 20 January 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

Citing what are called the Hanban's three "T-words" (Taiwan, Tibet, and Tiananmen) that are anathema for discussion at Confucius Institutes, Alan H. Yang and Michael Hsiao said the straightforward mission and goal of CIs is "to improve and reshape the image of China" as "recalibrated and discoursed by Beijing government."&lt;ref&gt;Alan H. Yang and Michael Hsiao [http://www.jamestown.org/single/?no_cache=1&amp;tx_ttnews%5Btt_news%5D=39592&amp;tx_ttnews%5BbackPid%5D=589#.Uc4timLVBIE Confucius Institutes and the Question of China’s Soft Power Diplomacy], ''China Brief'', Volume 12 Issue 13, 6 July 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

Lionel M. Jensen, associate professor of East Asian languages and cultures from the [[University of Notre Dame]], while noting "so far there have not been any events in which the academic freedom of the host university was explicitly threatened by authorities of Hanban", expressed concerns regarding the CI's educational objectives and quality of teaching. Jensen said the Hanban has reduced the diversity of China's cultures to a "uniform, quaint commodity", characterized by Chinese opera and dance performances, which he calls "culturetainment", meaning "the abridgment of Chinese civilization in the name of digestible forms of cultural appeal can be readily shipped overseas."&lt;ref&gt;Elizabeth Redden (2012), [http://www.insidehighered.com/news/2012/01/04/debate-over-chinese-funded-institutes-american-universities Confucius Says … Debate over Chinese-funded institutes at American universities], ''[[Inside Higher Ed]]'' 4 January 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

Randolph Kluver, Director of the Confucius Institute at [[Texas A&amp;M University]], said that the soft power paradigm was inadequate for understanding CIs, which could better be understood within a "communicative paradigm" of bringing China's cultural resources into a global conversation about values, politics, and culture.&lt;ref&gt;Randolph Kluver (2014), [http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/cccr.12046/abstract "The Sage as Strategy: Nodes, Networks, and the Quest for Geopolitical Power in the Confucius Institute"]. ''[[Communication, Culture &amp; Critique]]'', 7(2).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Randolph Kluver (2014), [http://ww2.chinamediaresearch.net/readmore/vol10no1/CMR140101-Randy-Kluver-done.jpg "Introduction: the Confucius Institute as a Communicative Phenomenon"]. ''China Media Research'', 10 (1).&lt;/ref&gt; Kluver concluded that despite the Chinese government's attitude, Confucius Institutes had little impact on attitudes towards Chinese political agendas.

''[[The New York Times]]'' foreign correspondent [[Jane Perlez]] reported that the 2013 [[Pew Global Attitudes Project]] survey revealed China's approval rating in the United States had dropped 14 percentage points in two years, to the lowest rating for China in any region of the world. Perlez cited an article in the ''[[Journal of Contemporary China]]'' by Tao Xie, a professor of political science at Beijing Foreign Studies University, who said in an interview that his analysis "was rejected by Chinese academic publications because it criticized the Confucius Institutes that the Chinese government has opened in many countries."&lt;ref&gt;Jane Perlez (2013), [https://www.nytimes.com/2013/07/18/world/asia/in-china-and-us-mutual-distrust-grows-study-finds.html?pagewanted=1&amp;_r=0 In China and U.S., Mutual Distrust Grows, Study Finds], ''The New York Times'' 18 July 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; Professor Tao statistically analyzed data from the 2007 Pew Global Attitudes survey for factors that affect cross-national variations in China's national image.&lt;ref&gt;Tao Xie and Benjamin I. Page (2013), [http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/pdf/10.1080/10670564.2013.782130 What Affects China's National Image? A cross-national study of public opinion], ''[[Journal of Contemporary China]]'', Routledge.&lt;/ref&gt; Presuming that Chinese [[foreign direct investment]] would increase positive public perceptions of China among recipients, Tao tested and disproved a hypothesis that "the number of Confucius institutes in a country should be positively related to favorable opinions about China among that country’s people."&lt;ref&gt;Tao and Page (2013), p. 7.&lt;/ref&gt; Tao methodologically notes that the number of institutes many be [[Endogeneity (economics)|endogenous]] in statistical terms, because the Hanban has opened most CIs in Europe and North America, "where perceptions of China have been the most unfavorable".&lt;ref&gt;Tao and Page (2013), p. 11.&lt;/ref&gt; Professor Tao concludes that the data reveal, "the Confucius institutes and classrooms have not succeeded in reversing the rather negative image of China in most of the countries where they are located."&lt;ref&gt;Tao and Page (2013), p. 17.&lt;/ref&gt;

Addressing a 2014 Dublin conference for European CIs, [[Liu Yunshan]], Director of the [[Propaganda Department of the Communist Party of China]], said Confucius Institutes had emerged at the right moment, and described them as a "spiritual high-speed rail" [心灵高铁], promoting friendship by connecting "Chinese dreams" with those of the rest of the world.&lt;ref name="Confucius says"&gt;[https://www.economist.com/news/china/21616988-decade-ago-china-began-opening-centres-abroad-promote-its-culture-some-people-are-pushing Confucius says], ''The Economist'', 13 September 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Perceived influences==
{{Further|Hanban}}
A number of criticisms surrounding the Confucius Institutes stem from their relationships with the Chinese government, through the Office of Chinese Language Council International or "[[Hanban]]". The Hanban website states that Confucius Institutes and Classrooms are non-profit educational institutions,&lt;ref&gt;[http://english.hanban.org/node_10971.htm Confucius Institute/Classroom], Hanban English website.&lt;/ref&gt; but they have close ties to several senior [[Communist Party of China|Communist Party]] officials, including the current Hanban chair and Politburo member [[Liu Yandong]],&lt;ref&gt;Hanban News, [http://english.hanban.org/article/2010-03/01/content_150421.htm 'Madame [[Liu Yandong]], State Councilor and Chair of the Confucius Institute Headquarters Delivers a New Year’s Address to Confucius Institutes Overseas'], 1 March 2010. Accessed 7 September 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; who was formerly head of the [[United Front Work Department]]. The Hanban members encompass twelve Chinese government institutions, from the [[Ministry of Education of the People's Republic of China|Ministry of Education]] to the [[State Council Information Office]] (or "Office of Foreign Propaganda") and the [[National Development and Reform Commission]], "through organizations dealing with Finance, Overseas Chinese, Foreign Affairs, Foreign Trade, Culture and all the media organizations."&lt;ref&gt;Valérie Niquet (2011), "'Confu-talk': the use of Confucian concepts in contemporary Chinese foreign policy," in [https://www.amazon.com/Thought-Management-Routledge-Studies-Transition/dp/0415616735/ ''China's Thought Management''], ed. by Anne-Marie Brady, Routledge, p. 82.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://sydney.edu.au/confucius_institute/partners/hanban.shtml The Office of Chinese Language Council International (Hanban)], The University of Sydney Confucius Institute.&lt;/ref&gt; "United Front Work" is a concept that harks back to the [[Chinese civil war]] and refers to "Beijing’s efforts to identify friends and isolate enemies. The logic here is that true friends will identify and isolate enemies from the CCP, while hiding any hint of direct involvement by the Party itself."&lt;ref&gt;Narayani Basu, [http://www.eurasiareview.com/08082012-confucius-institutes-in-america-soft-power-or-propaganda-analysis/ Confucius Institutes In America: Soft Power or Propaganda? – Analysis], ''Eurasia Review'', 8 August 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Steven W. Mosher]], president of the [[Population Research Institute]], testified the United Front Work Department's purpose "is subversion, cooption and control," and claimed one of the CI's chief purposes is "to subvert, coopt, and ultimately control Western academic discourse on matters pertaining to China."&lt;ref name="foreignaffairs.house.gov"&gt;Mosher, Steven W. (2012), [http://foreignaffairs.house.gov/112/HHRG-112-FA17-WState-MosherS-20120328.pdf Confucius Institutes: Trojan Horses with Chinese Characteristics], Testimony Presented to the [[United States House Foreign Affairs Subcommittee on Oversight and Investigations]], 28 March 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

An article from the state-run ''[[China Daily]]'' said that "Confucius Institutes' work is misunderstood from time to time," citing the example of Mosher calling CIs "[[Trojan Horses]] with Chinese characteristics." In response, Xu Lin, director-general of the Hanban, said, "The Confucius Institutes are definitely not Trojan Horses, since we are holding no weapons in our hands."&lt;ref&gt;Qu Yingpu, Zhao Huanxin and Cheng Ying (2012), [http://www.chinadaily.com.cn/china/2012-12/02/content_15978436.htm Confucius Institutes go beyond borders], ''China Daily'' 2012-12-02.&lt;/ref&gt; An ''[[Asian Survey]]'' article notes concerns over a "[[Trojan horse]] effect" of CIs. "The Confucius Institute project can be seen at one level as an attempt to increase Chinese language learning and an appreciation of Chinese culture, but at another level it is part of a broader soft power projection in which China is attempting to win hearts and minds for political purposes." Besides CIs, some other ways China raises its cultural profile overseas include [[Chinese contemporary art]] exhibitions, television programs, concerts by popular singers, and translations of Chinese literature.&lt;ref&gt;James F. Paradise (2009), [http://wenku.baidu.com/view/3b7190f79e31433239689307.html China and International Harmony: The Role of Confucius Institutes in Bolstering Beijing's Soft Power], ''Asian Survey'' 49.4: 648–649.&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Fabrice De Pierrebourg and Michel Juneau-Katsuya, a number of individuals holding positions within the Confucius Institute system have backgrounds in Chinese security agencies and [[United Front Work Department]], "which manages important dossiers concerning foreign countries. These include propaganda, the control of Chinese students abroad, the recruiting of agents among the Chinese diaspora (and among sympathetic foreigners), and long-term clandestine operations."&lt;ref name=Nest/&gt;

A declassified intelligence report by the [[Canadian Security Intelligence Service]] (CSIS) says, "Beijing is out to win the world's hearts and minds, not just its economic markets, as a means of cementing power."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.westendchronicle.com/article-cp69319033-CSIS-say-Confucius-part-of-Chinese-bid-to-win-over-western-hearts.html "CSIS say: Confucius part of Chinese bid to win over western hearts"], ''The Chronicle'', 27 May 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; In an interview on [[CBC Television]], [[Richard Fadden]], director of the CSIS, said that while China was funding Confucius Institutes in most of the campuses across Canada, they were "managed by people operating out of the embassy or consulates" who had organized "demonstrations to deal with what are called the five poisons: Taiwan, Falun Gong and others".&lt;ref name="Marcus 2013"&gt;Marcus (2013).&lt;/ref&gt; Stockholm's [[Institute for Security and Development Policy]] described the founding of CIs as "an image management project, the purpose of which is to promote the greatness of Chinese culture while at the same time counterattacking public opinion which maintains the presence of a 'China threat' in the international community."&lt;ref&gt;Xiaolin Guo (2008), [http://silkr.cqtest.se/files/publications/ap/08/xg08repackagingconfucius.pdf Repackaging Confucius], Institute for Security and Development Policy, Stockholm, Sweden, July 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

Although the number of Indian students taking Chinese language courses is on the increase, the [[Ministry of External Affairs (India)|Ministry of External Affairs]] rejected the idea of establishing Confucius Institutes in schools, as they were "using culture to spread propaganda and influence."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.domain-b.com/economy/general/20091008_pratibha_patil.html No Chinese in India, says government news], Domain-b, 8 Oct 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/home/sunday-toi/special-report/How-to-be-a-cultural-superpower/articleshow/5256363.cms How to be a cultural superpower], ''Times of India'', 22 Nov 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; Of the more than 17 CIs launched in Japan since 2005, all were at private colleges, instead of at more prestigious [[National university|national universities]]. "Chinese culture traditionally holds significant influence in Japan, but people remain concerned by the potential ideological and cultural threat of Chinese government-run projects such as CIs."&lt;ref&gt;Ren Zhe (2010).&lt;/ref&gt;

A ''[[Der Spiegel]]'' article about threats from China's soft power criticized Beijing for using Confucius Institutes "in hopes of promoting what it views as China's cultural superiority".&lt;ref&gt;Erich Follath (2010), [http://www.spiegel.de/international/world/0,1518,708645-2,00.html The Dragon's Embrace: China's Soft Power Is a Threat to the West], Der Spiegel 07/28/2010.&lt;/ref&gt; German sinologists disagree about the degree of government control over the system. Jörg-Meinhard Rudolph from the [[East Asia Institute (Ludwigshafen)]] noted no German political party had financed any educational institutions in [[German universities]], "yet they are accepting money from the undemocratic Chinese Communist Party." Michael Lackner, deputy head of the Confucius Institute at the [[University of Erlangen-Nuremberg]], described the influence of German universities and said, "I am not sure whether Confucius Institute Headquarters really know what Chinese culture is. Thus, German academics could help define Chinese culture as a world culture."&lt;ref&gt;Christopher Ricking (2012), [http://www.dw.de/dw/article/0,,15688977,00.html Critics fear influence of Chinese state on Confucius Institute affiliates], [[Deutsche Welle]], 25 January 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

At a hearing of the [[United States-China Economic and Security Review Commission]], [[Anne-Marie Brady]], a [[University of Canterbury]] political science professor, testified that China considers propaganda work the "life blood of the Party-State in the current era", and promotes foreign propaganda towards the [[Overseas Chinese]] community through Confucius Institutes and activities such as "root-seeking" cultural tours.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.uscc.gov/hearings/2009hearings/written_testimonies/09_04_30_wrts/09_04_30_brady_statement.php?action=feb09 Testimony of Associate-Professor Anne-Marie Brady]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.uscc.gov/hearings/2009hearings/written_testimonies/09_04_30_wrts/09_04_30_brady_statement.pdf China’s Propaganda and Influence Operations, Its Intelligence Activities that Target the United States, and the Resulting Impacts on U.S. National Security], U.S.-China Economic &amp; Security Review Commission.&lt;/ref&gt; Three years later, Professor Brady analogized, "If we had a U.S. government agency that was stating that it was a tool for U.S. government propaganda, my colleagues would be up in arms about having a center like that on campus."&lt;ref name="Redden 2012"&gt;Redden (2012).&lt;/ref&gt;

There has also been criticism over the Communist Party's appropriation of Confucius. Under Mao Zedong, Confucian values and teachings were perennial targets of criticism and suppression, being viewed as vestiges of feudalism. According to ''[[Asia Times Online]]'', the [[Chinese Communist Party]] under [[Mao Zedong]] criticized Confucian teachings as "rubbish that should be thrown into the 'Ash heap of history'" while the 21st-century CCP uses Confucianism as "an assistant to the Chinese [[Cai Shen|god of wealth]] (and a representative of Chinese diplomacy), but not a tutor for Chinese soul."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.atimes.com/atimes/China/KJ09Ad01.html Confucianism a vital string in China's bow], Jian Junbo, ''Asia Times'' , 9 October 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Comparisons with similar organizations===
Confucius Institutes are frequently compared to cultural associations such as the UK's [[British Council]],&lt;ref&gt;Jessica Shephard (2007), [https://www.theguardian.com/education/2007/nov/06/highereducation.internationaleducationnews 'Not a propaganda tool': China's Confucius Institutes are proliferating at UK universities, but are they cultural or political bodies?], ''The Guardian'' 5 November 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; Germany's [[Goethe-Institut]],&lt;ref name=20110220smh&gt;Justin Norrie (2011), [http://www.smh.com.au/national/education/confucius-says-schools-in-but-dont-mention-democracy-20110219-1b09x.html Confucius says school's in, but don't mention democracy], ''The Sydney Morning Herald'', 20 February 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;  France's [[Alliance Française]], Italy's [[Società Dante Alighieri]], and Spain's [[Instituto Cervantes]].&lt;ref&gt;Alexander Kuenzle and Ting Song (2012), [http://www.swissinfo.ch/eng/politics/Chinese_culture_centres_spark_propaganda_fears_.html?cid=32216386 Chinese culture centres spark propaganda fears], 5 March 2012, [[swissinfo]].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=uwn20071202maslen/&gt;  For instance, an editorial in the state-owned ''[[China Daily]]'' newspaper accused CI opponents of double standards for not calling "Goethe-Institut, Alliance Française or [[Instituto Cervantes|Cervantes Institutes]] propaganda vehicles or tools of cultural invasion". The editorial noted that "China is not the first to set up such institutes nor does it have a monopoly over overseas cultural promotion."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url= http://www.chinadaily.com.cn/opinion/2010-08/14/content_11153143.htm|title=No need to fuss over Confucius Institutes|first=Liu|last=Chang|agency=[[Xinhua]]|work=China Daily|date=12 August 2010|accessdate=14 August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, unlike the aforementioned organizations, the CI model is attachment to universities or other educational institutions, thus leading to suspicions the institutes are "aimed less at fostering interest in China and Chinese culture itself, and more at ensuring that such interest is guided along lines approved of by the Chinese party-state."&lt;ref name=CHQ26/&gt; Steven Mosher notes: "Unlike Alliance Francaise, the Confucius Institutes are not independent from their government; unlike the Goethe-Institut establishments, they do not occupy their own premises. Instead, participating universities agree to provide office space in exchange for funding, and to cede academic control to the United Front Work Department of the Chinese Communist Party."&lt;ref&gt;Steven W. Mosher, [http://www.humanevents.com/2012/09/07/confucius-institutes-how-china-is-carrying-out-a-long-march-through-our-universities-and-brainwashing-the-next-generation/ Confucius Institutes: China Carries out a 'Long March' through our Universities], ''[[Human Events]]'', 7 September 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; Martin Davidson, chief executive of the British Council, criticized comparisons between his institution and CIs. "We are a stand-alone organization operating out of our own premises. They are being embedded in university campuses. The real question has to be one of independence." Davidson said while the Chinese are very clear about wanting to combat negative propaganda with positive propaganda, "The danger is more of self-censorship — which is a very subtle thing."&lt;ref&gt;[[D.

Jocelyn Chey, a former diplomat and expert in Australia-China relations, stated the Confucius Institutes are more closely managed by its government compared with its French counterpart.&lt;ref name=uwn20071202maslen/&gt; She believes the institute's program is most valuable where it supports culture and outreach into the community.&lt;ref name=20080618smhharriet/&gt; Chey however states CI is "a propaganda vehicle for the Chinese communist party, and not a counterpart to the Goethe Institute or Alliance Française",&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.theaustralian.news.com.au/story/0,25197,22284825-12332,00.html "Confucius deal close despite concerns"], ''[[The Australian]]'', 22 August 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Jocelyn Chey (2008), [http://www.thesydneyinstitute.com.au/podcast/chinese-%E2%80%9Csoft-power%E2%80%9D-%E2%80%93-diplomacy-and-the-confucius-institute/ "Chinese 'Soft Power' – Diplomacy and The Confucius Institute podcast"], Sydney Papers Vol. 20 No. 1, pp. 33–48.&lt;/ref&gt; and speculates the close links between the institutes and the Chinese Communist Party "could lead at best to a 'dumbing down' of research and at worst could produce propaganda."&lt;ref name=20080618smhharriet&gt;Harriet Alexander (2008), [http://www.smh.com.au/news/national/sydney-is-chinas-new-friend/2008/06/17/1213468423152.html Sydney is China's new friend], Higher Education Reporter, ''Sydney Morning Herald'', 18 June 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; On the other hand, ''The Sydney Morning Herald'' cites a Queensland University of Technology student that "It would be best to understand [Confucius institutes] not as 'propaganda tools' but as 'one instrument of China's cultural diplomacy to wield and bolster Chinese soft power globally'".&lt;ref name=20110220smh/&gt;

Confucius Institutes also bear similarities{{source?|date=October 2017}} to the [[Chinese Students and Scholars Association]] which has come under criticism for interference by the Chinese government on American university campuses.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2017/05/04/us/chinese-students-western-campuses-china-influence.html|}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Financing==
Confucius Institutes mostly run a small number of classes, with an average budget of US$400,000 per institute in 2009.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hanban.org/report/pdf/2009_final.pdf 2009 Annual Report], Hanban.org.&lt;/ref&gt; They are funded jointly by grants from China's Ministry of Education and funds from host universities; although Hanban set a financial objective for self-sufficiency within five years, many CIs have struggled.&lt;ref name="ATp1"&gt;[http://www.atimes.com/atimes/China/IE24Ad01.html The language of Chinese soft power in the US].

David Prager Branner, a Chinese professor at Columbia University, warns that taking money from China to set up Confucius Institutes could have long-term consequences and questions whether it would be in America's national interest.&lt;ref name="Redden 2012"/&gt; Some critics have suggested Beijing's contributions to host universities gives Chinese authorities too much leverage over those institutions. The sizeable grants coming with the establishment of Confucius Institutes could make universities more susceptible to pressures from Beijing to exercise self-censorship, particularly on Chinese human rights issues or other politically sensitive topics.&lt;ref name=BCIT&gt;Janet Steffenhagen, [http://www.canada.com/vancouversun/news/westcoastnews/story.html?id=179b4e77-f0cf-4608-a8b7-a9943116f489 'Has BCIT sold out to Chinese propaganda?'], ''Vancouver Sun'', 2 April 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;  ''The Economist'' points out that some Chinese language courses at Confucius Institutes are even paid for by the Pentagon under the [[National Security Language Initiative]].&lt;ref name=20091022economist/&gt;

In January 2010, the [[Ministry of Finance of the People's Republic of China]] announced that the winning bid (CEIECZB01-09JX033) to build and maintain the Confucius Institute Online website was awarded to the Hanban subsidiary company Wuzhou Hanfeng Web Technology Ltd.

Maria Wey-Shen Siow, East Asia bureau chief of [[Channel NewsAsia]], wrote in the [[East-West Center]]’s ''Asia Pacific Bulletin'' the concerns over Confucius Institutes projecting political undertones "are not completely unfounded, but may not be totally warranted."&lt;ref name=Siow&gt;Maria Wey-Shen Siow (2011), "[http://www.eastwestcenter.org/publications/search-for-publications/browse-alphabetic-list-of-titles/?class_call=view&amp;pub_ID=3691&amp;mode=view China’s Confucius Institutes: Crossing the River by Feeling the Stone]," ''Asia Pacific Bulletin'', No. 91.&lt;/ref&gt;  She highlights, for all the CI controversies, "Han Ban’s annual budget was only US$145 million in 2009 so it would be false to state China has been spending massively on these institutes."&lt;ref name="Siow"/&gt; Lionel Jensen writes, "According to a 2006 BBC report, the Chinese government initially committed $10 billion for operating the Confucius Institute program."&lt;ref&gt;Lionel M.

In a 2010 [[United States Senate Committee on Foreign Relations|Senate Foreign Relations Committee]] hearing, Senator [[Richard Lugar]] asked Secretary of State [[Hillary Clinton]] why China had established 60 Confucius Institutes in the United States but only permitted 4 comparable US cultural centers in China, and she replied, "The Chinese government provides each center with a million dollars to launch, plus they cover operating expenses that exceed $200,000 per year. We don't have that kind of money in the budget."&lt;ref&gt;Nicholas Kralev, [http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2010/apr/08/china-60-us-0-culture-centers-in-others-country/?page=all China 60, U.S. 0: Culture Centers in Other’s Country], ''The Washington Times'', 8 April 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

Some critics, including within China, have expressed worry "the government’s support for the CIs' budgets detracts from domestic spending" when the [[Ministry of Education of the People's Republic of China|Ministry of Education]] "budget for domestic compulsory education remains inadequate." Swedish parliamentarian [[Göran Lindblad]] asked why Chinese authorities are subsidizing Western educational institutions when "China has ten million children without proper schools."&lt;ref&gt;Starr (2009), p. 6.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"i Kina är tio miljoner barn utan en ordentlig skola" [http://www.riksdagen.se/Webbnav/index.aspx?nid=101&amp;bet=2007/08:46 Riksdagens snabbprotokoll 2007/08:46 (in Swedish)]&lt;/ref&gt;

Financing for the Confucius Institute at the [[London School of Economics]] came under criticism following the "[[LSE Gaddafi links]]" controversy over accepting a £1.5 million donation from [[Libya]]. Christopher Hughes, professor of international relations, said the school's acceptance of about £400,000 from China showed it had failed to learn from the scandal. Hughes accused the CI of being a "divisive" and "illegitimate" propaganda organization, and said its existence would damage the school's reputation.&lt;ref&gt;Richard Kerbaj (2012), [http://www.timesplus.co.uk/sto/?login=false&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.thesundaytimes.co.uk%2Fsto%2Fnews%2Fuk_news%2FEducation Beijing cash threatens to plunge LSE into new donations scandal], ''The Sunday Times'', 20 May 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; In reference to Hughes, [[Liu Xiaoming]], Chinese ambassador to the United Kingdom, accused CI critics of clinging to "outdated 'cold war' mentality"; to which Hughes replied that it was "gross interference" for Liu to complain about an internal LSE discussion on ethics.&lt;ref&gt;Tania Branigan, [https://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/jun/15/confucius-institutes-universities-chinese-ambassador Chinese ambassador attacks 'cold war' fears over Confucius Institutes], [[The Guardian]], 15 June 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

On 10 June, Hughes emailed colleagues discussing CI teaching materials a link to an animated video, in Chinese with English subtitles, on the official Confucius Institute Online website. It was titled "The War to Resist US Aggression and Aid Korea" (which is the Chinese official name ''Kangmeiyuanchao zhanzheng'' 抗美援朝战争 for "Korean War) and summarized the [[Korean War]] with negative [[Historical revisionism (negationism)|historical revisionism]]. Specifically, the film "declares that the Chinese were provoked into entering the war because the United States had bombed Chinese villages near the Korean border, and had manipulated the UN Security Council into passing a resolution that enabled American troops to expand aggression against Korea."&lt;ref name=ChinaU/&gt; After the video link began circulating on Twitter,&lt;ref&gt;Colin Freeze, James Bradshaw, and Mark Mackinnon (2012).&lt;/ref&gt; the CI website deleted the webpage on June 11,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.freedomhouse.org/article/china-media-bulletin-issue-no-62 Confucius Institutes face ethical concerns in Britain, Canada], ''China Media Bulletin: Issue No. 62'', 28 June 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://kid.chinese.cn/en/article/2009-09/01/content_51110.htm 本网页已删除] [This webpage already deleted].&lt;/ref&gt; but cache copies remain available.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=13k3AEjHNR0 The War to Resist US Aggression and Aid Korea], YouTube, 19 June 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; This educational animation was part of an online "Chinese history" course under the CI homepage's "Chinese Learning for Kids ＆ Teens" section.&lt;ref&gt;[http://kid.chinese.cn/en/article/2009-09/01/content_51109.htm Chinese history, The Founding of New China, Related Video], Confucius Institute Online.&lt;/ref&gt; The censored video claimed the "United States manipulated the UN Security Council … to enlarge the aggression against Korea" and "tried to seize the whole peninsula"; in response, Chinese "volunteers" from the [[People's Liberation Army]] joined the fight and "crushed the imperialists' aggressive ambitions", which "enhanced China’s international prestige" in the Korean War.&lt;ref&gt;Josh Rudolph, [http://chinadigitaltimes.net/2012/06/controversy-continues-confucius-institutes/ Controversy continues over Confucius Institutes], ''[[China Digital Times]]'', 20 June 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

A 2012 article in ''[[The Atlantic]]'' questions whether China has squandered the soft-power money spent on CIs and expensive [[CCTV-4|CCTV-4 America]] studios when wealthy Chinese are seeking [[Visa requirements for Chinese citizens|exit visas]] to the US; asking, "What good are Confucius Institutes … when many of your country's elites are voting with their feet and hedging against domestic unpredictability?"&lt;ref&gt;Damien Ma, [https://www.theatlantic.com/international/archive/2012/05/losing-face-why-china-cant-stop-squandering-its-soft-power/257090/ Losing Face: Why China Can't Stop Squandering Its Soft Power], ''The Atlantic'', 14 May 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

''The Economist'' describes the Hanban's spending on CIs as "considerable, and growing rapidly". In 2013 it was $278m, more than six times as much as in 2006. China's funding for Confucius Institutes amounts to about $100,000-200,000 a year on many campuses, and sometimes more.&lt;ref name="Confucius says"/&gt;
According to an article in [[Foreign Policy]], many Chinese view this $278 million expenditure for an overseas soft-power initiative as a waste of money, which would be better spent on building schools in poor rural areas of China.&lt;ref name="foreignpolicy.com"/&gt;

== Espionage ==
Critics of Confucius Institutes have cited concerns it could serve as a vehicle for industrial and military espionage, as well as for surveillance of Chinese students studying abroad.  The intelligence services of several countries have investigated Confucius Institutes, including the Canadian organization CSIS.&lt;ref name=Nest&gt;Fabrice de Pierrebourg and Michel Juneau-Katsuya, "Nest of Spies: the starting truth about foreign agents at work within Canada’s borders," HarperCollins Canada, 2009. pp 160 – 162&lt;/ref&gt; [[David Matas]] said that "informally [the institutes] become a vehicle the Chinese government uses to basically intimidate the academic institutions to run according to their guise and also as a vehicle for infiltration and spying into the campuses to find out what's going on hostile to their interest."&lt;ref name=BCIT/&gt;

Pierrebourg and Juneau-Katsuya also raised concerns over ties between Confucius Institute administrators and large state-run Chinese companies. For instance, they point to the Confucius Institute at the [[University of Texas at Dallas]], where one of the top officials is also vice-president of [[Huawei]], a Chinese telecom company the U.S. government regards as a national security threat, and which has been accused of [[industrial espionage]],&lt;ref name=Nest/&gt; though an extensive security review found no clear evidence of spying.&lt;ref&gt;Joseph Mann (2012), " Exclusive: White House review finds no evidence of spying by Huawei – sources," Reuters, 17 Oct 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''[[People's Daily]]'' reports [[Osaka Sangyo University]], which opened a Confucius Institute and closed it after one year of operation, formally apologized for an employee who called the CI "a spy agency established to gather cultural intelligence."&lt;ref name="english.peopledaily.com.cn"&gt;[http://english.peopledaily.com.cn/90001/90782/7023278.html Japanese university apologizes for calling Confucius Institute spy agency], ''People's Daily'', 12 June 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Political ==
Confucius Institutes are described as transmitting political influence in a "sublimely veiled manner".&lt;ref&gt;Sheng Ding and Robert A. Saunders (2006), "Talking Up China: An Analysis of China’s Rising Cultural Power and the Global Promotion of the Chinese Language," ''East Asia: An International Journal'', Vol. 23, No. 2, p. 21.&lt;/ref&gt; Canada's ''[[The Globe and Mail|Globe and Mail]]'' reported, "Despite their neutral scholarly appearance, the new network of Confucius Institutes does have a political agenda." For example, teaching with the [[simplified Chinese characters]] used in the PRC rather than the [[Traditional Chinese characters]] used in Taiwan "would help to advance Beijing’s goal of marginalizing Taiwan in the battle for global inﬂuence.”&lt;ref&gt;Geoffrey York (2005), "Beijing uses Confucius to lead [[charm offensive]]" ''The Globe and Mail'', 9 September 2005. Quoted by Sheng Ding and Robert A. Saunders (2006), "Talking up China: An analysis of China’s rising cultural power and global promotion of the Chinese language," ''East Asia'', 23.2, p. 21.&lt;/ref&gt; An article in ''China Heritage Quarterly'' criticizes teaching only simplified characters in the context of Confucius Institutes as "semi-literacy in Chinese".&lt;ref name=CHQ26&gt;Michael Churchman (2011), [http://www.chinaheritagequarterly.org/articles.php?searchterm=026_confucius.inc&amp;issue=026 Confucius Institutes and Controlling Chinese Languages], ''China Heritage Quarterly'' 26, The Australian National University.&lt;/ref&gt; In response to the PRC's CI program, the [[Republic of China]] announced plans in 2011 to establish "Taiwan Academies" in America, Europe, and Asia as part of its cultural diplomacy. The Taiwan Academy program is designed to promote "Taiwanese-favored" [[Mandarin Chinese]], traditional Chinese characters, and Taiwanese topics.&lt;ref&gt;[https://blogs.wsj.com/chinarealtime/2011/08/12/soft-power-smackdown-confucius-institute-vs-taiwan-academy/ Soft Power Smackdown! Confucius Institute vs. Taiwan Academy], ''The Wall Street Journal'' 12 August 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; Marshall Sahlins also makes this claim about simplified characters, which scholars have disputed; [[George Washington University]] historian Edward McCord says many Chinese language departments teach simplified characters of their own volition, and [[Lewis &amp; Clark College]] anthropologist Jennifer Hubbert says Sahlins overlooked the fact that most trained sinologists can read Chinese in both character sets, and training in one does not preclude access to the other.&lt;ref&gt;Jennifer Hubbert, [http://www.anthropology-news.org/index.php/2014/05/01/the-anthropology-of-confucius-institutes/ The Anthropology of Confucius Institutes], ''Anthropology News'',1 May 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Peng Ming-min]], a [[Taiwan independence]] activist and politician, writes although on the surface China merely demonstrates its "soft power" through CIs, "Colleges and universities where a Confucius Institute is established all have to sign a contract in which they declare their support for Beijing’s “one China” policy. As a result, both Taiwan and Tibet have become taboos at these institutes." Peng lists other examples of CI "untouchable" issues including the [[1989 Tiananmen Square massacre]], neglect of [[Human rights in the People's Republic of China|human rights]], environmental [[pollution in China]], and the imprisonment of [[Liu Xiaobo]].&lt;ref&gt;Peng Ming-min 彭明敏 (31 May 2011), [http://www.taipeitimes.com/News/editorials/archives/2011/05/31/2003504575 "China picks pockets of academics worldwide"], ''Taipei Times'', p. 8.&lt;/ref&gt; However, BC lawyer and China expert Clive Ansley said there were "troubling signs of [China's] growing influence on western campuses" before Confucius Institutes were established. He saw signs the public discussions about certain human-rights issues were being self-censored, out of fear of losing out on intake of Chinese students.&lt;ref name=BCIT/&gt;

Michael Nylan, professor of Chinese history at the [[University of California at Berkeley]], says CIs have become less heavy-handed in their demands, and have learned from "early missteps," such as insisting universities adopt a policy Taiwan is part of China. Nylan took an informal survey of faculty and administrators at fifteen universities with Confucius Institutes; "two respondents reported that institutes had exerted pressure to block guest speakers," but both events went ahead anyway.&lt;ref name=20111102bloomberg/&gt;

Taiwan is one of the few major countries that do not have Confucius Institutes, and scholars from [[Academia Sinica]]'s Center for Asia-Pacific Area Studies carried out a two-year research project to collect empirical evidence on CIs. The project leader Michael Hsiao (蕭新煌), chairperson of Academia Sinica's Institute of Sociology, said he learned the implicit rules about off-limit topics—Taiwan, Tibet, the Dalai Lama, the Tiananmen Square massacre, and Falun Gong—during interviews with staff at CI host institutions in Southeast Asian countries and in the US. Hsiao called the Hanban's rapid expansion of Confucius Institutes into over 105 countries "a smart move," but also mentioned that CI criticisms have arisen in at universities worldwide. "People in favor of the institutes say they bring in revenue and provide opportunities for students to learn Chinese. Those opposed to the initiative worry they place limitations on academic freedom and dislike the political machinations behind them."&lt;ref&gt;Shih Hsiu-chuan, [http://www.taipeitimes.com/News/taiwan/archives/2012/12/10/2003549802/1 Academics divided on role of Confucius Institutes], ''Taipei Times'', 10 December 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

The historian [[Yu Ying-shih]] received the inaugural Tang Prize in [[Sinology]] in 2014. At the awards ceremony, he criticized the CCP's promotion of Confucianism and establishment of 465 Confucius Institutes worldwide as "all propaganda with political purposes".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ntdtv.com/xtr/b5/2014/09/22/a1140166.html Tang Prize Winner Yu Ying-shih Criticizes Communist Confucianism], [[NDTV]], 22 September 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Censorship and academic freedom==
{{further|Censorship in China|Political status of Taiwan}}
Jonathan Zimmerman critically framed the question of Confucius Institutes and academic freedom, "Let's suppose that a cruel, tyrannical, and repressive foreign government offered to pay for American teens to study its national language in our schools. Would you take the deal?" Zimmerman concluded that more Americans should study Chinese, but "on our own terms, making sure that it also reflects our best civic language of freedom, open discussion, and democracy."&lt;ref name=CSM20060906zimmer/&gt; Chinese history professor Jonathan Lipman from [[Mount Holyoke College]] expressed the dilemma of accepting CI funding thus: "By peddling a product we want, namely Chinese language study, the Confucius Institutes bring the Chinese government into the American academy in powerful ways. The general pattern is very clear. They can say, 'We'll give you this money, you'll have a Chinese program, and nobody will talk about Tibet.' In this economy, turning them down has real costs."&lt;ref name=20111102bloomberg&gt;Golden, Daniel (2 November 2011), [https://www.bloomberg.com/news/2011-11-01/china-says-no-talking-tibet-as-confucius-funds-u-s-universities.html China Says No Talking Tibet as Confucius Funds U.S. Universities], ''Bloomberg News''.&lt;/ref&gt; Professor Terry Russell at the [[University of Manitoba]] questioned the Hanban's real motivation, fearing the university would not be able to organize certain activities judged "sensitive" to the Chinese, such as bringing the Dalai Lama onto campus. He said, "'We have a real conflict of our principles of academic freedom,' with the potential to have a faculty version of Chinese history and a Confucius Institute version being taught on campus."&lt;ref name=macleans20110427&gt;Nick Martin (27 April 2011), Manitoba Profs Wary Chinese Could Start Spying on Campus, ''Ottawa Citizen'', 27 April 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://oncampus.macleans.ca/education/2011/04/27/profs-worry-china-preparing-to-spy-on-students/ Profs worry China preparing to spy on students], Macleans.&lt;/ref&gt; According to Cameron Morrill, president of the University of Manitoba Faculty Association, "It is inappropriate to allow any government, either foreign or domestic, control over a university classroom, regardless of how much money they offer."&lt;ref name="Redden 2012"/&gt; The university later decided against taking Chinese government money to set up CIs.&lt;ref&gt;Josh Dehaas, [http://oncampus.macleans.ca/education/2011/06/21/talks-end-between-confucius-institutes-and-u-manitoba/ Talks end between Confucius Institutes and U Manitoba], ''Macleans on Campus'', 21 June 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2010, the [[University of Oregon]] "came under – and resisted – pressure from the Chinese consul general in San Francisco" to cancel a lecture by Peng Ming-Min (see above).&lt;ref name=chronicle20100601schmidt/&gt; [[Glenn Anthony May]], a UO history professor wrote an article expressing concerns that Confucius Institutes "come with visible strings attached." For instance, host institutions must sign a memorandum of understanding to support the [[One-China policy]]. "At universities, we normally have an opportunity to debate issues like that, allowing professors like me and students to take issue publicly with our government's policy. Hanban, for obvious reasons, wants no such discussion to occur."&lt;ref&gt;Glenn Anthony May (2011), [http://www.asiasentinel.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=3035&amp;Itemid=206 Confucius on the Campus], ''Asia Sentinel'', 4 March 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; Meiru Liu, director of the Confucius Institute at [[Portland State University]], rejects May's criticisms CIs hinder open discussions of issues such as the treatment of political activist [[Liu Xiaobo]]. Meiru Liu explained that while [[Falun Gong]], dissidents and [[1989 Tiananmen Square protests]] are not topics the Confucius Institute headquarters would like to see organized by the institutes, they are "not major interest and concerns now by general public at large here in the US."&lt;ref name="oregonlive.com"&gt;[http://www.oregonlive.com/business/index.ssf/2011/03/oregon_pacific_rim_roundup_bei.html Oregon Pacific Rim roundup: Beijing moves into U.S. campuses], OregonLive, 8 March 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; Fellow UO professor and CI director Bryna Goodman countered May, noting the local Confucius Institute hosted forums on sensitive topics such as China's internet censorship and economic regulations, and "We haven't gotten any topic that has been proposed to us that we have considered out of bounds."&lt;ref name="oregonlive.com"/&gt;

The establishment of some Confucius Institutes has been opposed or blocked by faculty members at universities. Faculty at the [[University of Pennsylvania]] decided not to negotiate with CI due to fears of meddling in course curriculum.&lt;ref&gt;Christine Armario, [http://www.newsday.com/news/nation/china-expands-language-institutes-at-us-colleges-1.1560189 China expands language institutes at US colleges], [[Associated Press]], 30 October 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Julie Xie, [http://thedp.com/index.php/article/2011/11/confucius_institutes_to_be_reconsidered_by_penn Confucius Institutes to be reconsidered by Penn], ''The Daily Pennsylvanian'' 13 November 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;  Members of the Chinese studies department at the [[University of Melbourne]] forced the institute off the main campus.&lt;ref name=uwn20071202maslen&gt;Geoff Maslen (2007), [http://www.universityworldnews.com/article.php?story=20071130094503100 Warning – be wary of Confucius institutes] University World News, 2 December 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; Faculty at [[Stockholm University]] demanded the separation of the Nordic Confucius Institute from the university, but an independent assessment rejected their claims that the Chinese Embassy in Stockholm was using the CI for conducting political surveillance and inhibiting academic freedom.&lt;ref name=EJE2009/&gt;

In writing for the ''[[Christian Science Monitor]]'', Jonathan Zimmerman, a historian at New York University, warned that Confucius Institutes resemble the 1930s "Mussolini model" of financing Italian language schools in America for Fascist propaganda purposes.&lt;ref name=CSM20060906zimmer&gt;Zimmerman, Jonathan (6 September 2006).

A major concern of Confucius Institutes is their response to politically-sensitive and controversial material such as human rights and Taiwan. Meiru Liu, director of the Confucius Institute at [[Portland State University]], states the local institute had sponsored lectures on Tibet, China's economic development, currency, and US-China relations. Mary E. Gallagher, director of the Center for Chinese Studies at the [[University of Michigan]], said the institutes has been free in covering "that are controversial and sensitive in China".&lt;ref&gt;Schmidt, Peter (17 September 2010), [http://chronicle.texterity.com/chronicle/20101022a?pg=8#pg8 At U.S. Colleges, Chinese-Financed Centers Prompt Worries About Academic Freedom], ''The Chronicle of Higher Education''.&lt;/ref&gt; In particular, the Confucius Institute in [[Edinburgh]] promoted a talk by a dissident Chinese author whose works are banned in China.&lt;ref name="20091022economist"/&gt;

Lionel M. Jensen, professor of East Asian Languages and history at the [[University of Notre Dame]], said, "Every Confucius Institute is a spectacular experiment in cultural outreach", but "the placement of institutes within the centers, departments, and institutes of public and private universities is ''without precedent'', and threatens the independent pursuit of research that is the enabling premise of higher education."&lt;ref&gt;Lionel M. Jensen (2011), "Culture Industry, Power, and the Spectacle of China's 'Confucius Institutes'," in Timothy B. Weston and Lionel M.

A 21 June 2014 editorial in ''[[The Washington Post]]'' listed recent concerns about Confucius Institutes, including the AAUP advising universities to cut ties with CIs unless Hanban agreements are renegotiated, alleged violations of freedom of speech and human rights, and the secrecy of undisclosed contracts between schools and the Hanban. It concluded that "academic freedom cannot have a price tag", and recommended that if universities will not publish their CI agreements, the programs should end.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/the-price-of-confucius-institutes/2014/06/21/4d7598f2-f7b6-11e3-a3a5-42be35962a52_story.html The price of Confucius Institutes], The Washington Post, 21 June 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; The official Chinese news agency Xinhua "hit back with an angry editorial" on 24 June,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.weekinchina.com/2014/07/compulsory-education/ Compulsory education: A setback for Confucius], Week in China, 4 July 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; saying the claims by the AAUP and others that CIs "function as an arm of the Chinese state and are pushing political agendas", actually "expose not so much communist propaganda as their own intolerance of exotic cultures and biased preconceived notions to smear and isolate the CPC".&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.xinhuanet.com/english/china/2014-06/24/c_133431220.htm China Voice: Fear, ignorance behind calls to stem Confucius Institutes], Xinhua, 23 June 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Columbia University]] received $1 million in Hanban funds over five years, to begin a CI. Professor Robert Barnett, the director of the Modern Tibetan Studies Program, described a "strange silence about Tibet and other sensitive issues when it comes to Columbia, academics, and talks of China." Barnett said, "The issue is not China wants to promote itself and pay for Chinese to be taught. The issue is it wants to have a presence in the campus and much more than that. It wants to have a presence in the faculty and in teaching departments."&lt;ref name=columspect20111111/&gt; Lening Liu, director of the Confucius Institute at Columbia, said that it was "committed to academic integrity and that it would reject any attempt by Hanban to censor its research."&lt;ref name=columspect20111111&gt;von Mayrhauser, Melissa (11 November 2011), [http://www.columbiaspectator.com/2011/11/11/china-government-bankrolls-culture-institute-columbia China-funded institute tests Columbia's commitment to academic integrity], ''Columbia Spectator''.&lt;/ref&gt; Other academics have questioned how universities should respond when foreign governments limit academic freedom abroad. Since the 2001 publication of Columbia University professor [[Andrew J. Nathan]]'s ''[[Tiananmen Papers]]'', he and several other faculty members have been denied visas to China, and the Chinese government shut down the Modern Tibetan Studies Program's study abroad program in Tibet.&lt;ref name=columspect20111111/&gt;

Over 170 [[University of Chicago]] faculty members petitioned president [[Robert Zimmer]] against the establishment, without Faculty Senate approval, of a CI as well as a Milton Friedman Institute for Research in Economics.&lt;ref&gt;[http://uchicago-cores.org/petition/ Petition], CORES at UChicago.&lt;/ref&gt; The petition called Confucius Institutes "an academically and politically ambiguous initiative" sponsored by the PRC, and said the university risked having its own reputation used to "legitimate the spread" of CIs in the United States and around the world.&lt;ref name=chronicle20100601schmidt&gt;Peter Schmidt (2010a), [http://chronicle.com/article/U-of-Chicagos-Plans-for-M/65737/ U. of Chicago's Plans for Milton Friedman Institute Stir Outrage on the Faculty], ''[[The Chronicle of Higher Education]]'', 1 June 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

In late October 2013, Marshall Sahlins, a professor emeritus at the University of Chicago, published the article "China U: Confucius Institutes censor political discussions and restrain the free exchange of ideas. Why, then, do American universities sponsor them?" arguing that universities like the University of Chicago should take the lead in cancelling the arrangement.&lt;ref&gt;The Nation, print issue of 18 November 2013. http://www.thenation.com/article/176888/china-u&lt;/ref&gt; Writing in ''Forbes'', the Irish journalist [[Eamonn Fingleton]] says, "In one of the most scandalous sell-outs in intellectual history, more and more universities now accept funding from the Beijing Ministry of Education".&lt;ref&gt;Eamonn Fingleton, [https://www.forbes.com/sites/eamonnfingleton/2014/06/01/follow-the-chinese-money-the-tienanmen-anniversary-and-a-strange-silence-on-u-s-campuses/ Follow the (Chinese) Money: The Tiananmen Anniversary and a Scandalous Silence on U.S. Campuses], Forbes, 1 June 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; He calls the CI program a "Chinese mega-blooper", and says that largely thanks to Sahlins’ leadership, "academic staff at many universities have begun agitating to rid campuses of the phenomenon."&lt;ref&gt;Eamonn Fingleton, [https://www.forbes.com/sites/eamonnfingleton/2014/07/18/taking-back-america-here-finally-is-a-chinese-mega-blooper-and-a-chance-for-the-u-s-to-turn-the-tables/ Taking Back America: Here, Finally, Is A Chinese Mega-Blooper -- And A Chance For The U.S. To Turn The Tables], ''Forbes'' 18 July 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2014, Professor Sahlins wrote ''Confucius Institutes: Academic Malware'' because incidents of academic malpractice in CIs, "from the virtually unnoticeable to the publicly notorious, are disturbingly common".&lt;ref&gt;Marshall Sahlins (2014) ''Confucius Institutes: Academic Malware'', Prickly Paradigm Press, p. 5; revised and updated as [http://japanfocus.org/-Marshall-Sahlins/4220 Confucius Institutes: Academic Malware 孔子学院　学術的マルウェア], ''The Asia-Pacific Journal''  12.45.1.&lt;/ref&gt; Sahlins told the ''[[Times Higher Education]]'' that his book did not represent some sort of "rabid anti-communism of a McCarthyite or Cold War sort – as defenders of Confucius Institutes have claimed", but rather, the issue is the preservation of the "values of academic freedom and intellectual autonomy upon which universities in the US and most of the world are founded."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.timeshighereducation.co.uk/news/sector-urged-to-put-brakes-on-confucius-institutes-expansion/2016989.article Sector urged to put brakes on Confucius Institutes’ expansion], The ''Times Higher Education'', 20 November 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;

According to a ''Chronicle of Higher Education'' article, since the first Confucius Institute in the United States was established at the [[University of Maryland]] in 2004, "there have been no complaints of the institutes' getting in the way of academic freedom on American campuses"; the same article goes on to say that the Institutes are "distinct in the degree to which they were financed and managed by a foreign government."&lt;ref name=Chronicle20100917&gt;Peter Schmidt (2010b), [http://chronicle.texterity.com/chronicle/20101022a?pg=8#pg8 At U.S. Colleges, Chinese-Financed Centers Prompt Worries About Academic Freedom], ''The Chronicle of Higher Education'', 17 September 2010.

[[Stanford University]] was initially offered $4 million to host a CI and endow a Confucius Institute Professorship in Sinology, but Hanban requested that the professor not discuss "delicate issues". After Stanford refused based on academic freedom grounds, Hanban accepted making an unrestricted gift, and the university plans to use the money for a professorship in classical Chinese poetry.&lt;ref name=20111102bloomberg/&gt; Dean Richard Saller, who is also the CI director, explained the Hanban prizes the Stanford relationship too much to jeopardize it by interfering with academic freedom.

In 2009, [[North Carolina State University]] cancelled a planned appearance by the [[Dalai Lama]] to speak on its Raleigh campus, citing concerns about a Chinese backlash and a shortage of time and resources. Provost Warwick Arden said "China is a major trading partner for North Carolina," and a CI presents an "opportunity for subtle pressure and conflict."&lt;ref&gt;Golden (2011).&lt;/ref&gt; However, in 2010, the Dalai Lama spoke at Stanford University and [[Miami University]] (Ohio) &amp;ndash; both institutions have Confucius Institutes.&lt;ref name=20111102bloomberg/&gt;

On 28 March 2012, the [[United States House Foreign Affairs Subcommittee on Oversight and Investigations]] held a hearing on "The Price of Public Diplomacy with China," focusing upon Chinese propaganda efforts in the U.S., including Confucius Institutes on university campuses.&lt;ref&gt;[http://archives.republicans.foreignaffairs.house.gov/112/73537.pdf The Price of Public Diplomacy with China], Subcommittee on Oversight and Investigations House Committee on Foreign Affairs, 28 March 2012, full transcript and webcast.&lt;/ref&gt; Representative [[Dana Rohrabacher]] said, "The two pillars of America’s status as an open society are freedom of the press and academic freedom. Communist China, which does not believe in or allow the practice of either type of freedom, is exploiting the opportunities offered by America to penetrate both private media and public education to spread its state propaganda."&lt;ref&gt;[http://archives.republicans.foreignaffairs.house.gov/112/73537.pdf The Price of Public Diplomacy with China].&lt;/ref&gt; [[Steven W. Mosher]] testified, "there have been allegations of Confucius Institutes undermining academic freedom at host universities, engaging in industrial and military espionage, monitoring the activities of Chinese students abroad, and attempting to advance the Chinese Party-State’s political agenda on such issues as the Dalai Lama and Tibet, Taiwan independence, the pro-democracy movement abroad, and dissent within China itself."&lt;ref name="foreignaffairs.house.gov"/&gt; Responding to Mosher's testimony, Rohrabacher argued, "It appears as though Beijing is able to expand its campaign against academic freedom from China to America when U.S. universities value Chinese favors and money more than truth and integrity."&lt;ref&gt;[http://rohrabacher.house.gov/press-release/press-release-rep-rohrabacher-holds-hearing-increased-chinese-propaganda-efforts-us ***Press Release*** Rep.

The [[US Department of State]] issued a 17 May 2012 directive stating that the Chinese professors at university-based CIs were violating their [[J-1 visa]]s by teaching in schools at the precollege level and would have to return to China by 30 June to apply for a new visa. In addition, the institutes would be required to obtain US academic accreditation.&lt;ref&gt;[http://chronicle.com/items/biz/pdf/Guidance%20Directive%202012-06%20Confucius%20Institutes.pdf Guidance Directive 2012-06, Exchange Visitor Program – Confucius Institutes], US Department of State.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Karin Fischer (2012), [http://chronicle.com/article/State-Department-Directive/131934/ State Department Directive Could Disrupt Teaching Activities of Campus-Based Confucius Institutes], ''The Chronicle of Higher Education'', 21 May 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; Chinese officials reportedly applied pressure on Washington in response.&lt;ref&gt;Xinhua News, [http://news.xinhuanet.com/english/video/2012-05/26/c_131612830.htm US reverses directive on Confucius Institutes], ''Xinhuanet'', 26 May 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://english.cntv.cn/program/newshour/20120526/111705.shtml US reverses directive on Confucius Institutes], [[China Central Television]], 26 May 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; On 24 May, State Department spokesperson [[Victoria Nuland]] said there was "a mess-up in the processing in general" and called the original directive "sloppy and incomplete."

In April 2014, over 100 professors at the [[University of Chicago]] signed a petition calling for a University Senate Council vote against renewing the university's CI contract, saying that the Hanban's control of hiring and training teachers "subjects the university’s academic program to the political constraints on free speech and belief that are specific to the People’s Republic of China." The CI director [[Dali Yang]] denied these charges and said, "Our Confucius Institute does not offer classes of its own; the teachers participate in the University of Chicago Chinese language program." Marshall Sahlins said that if the U. of C. withdrew from the Confucius Institutes, other universities "will think twice about joining or renewing their contracts."&lt;ref&gt;Elizabeth Redden, [http://www.insidehighered.com/news/2014/04/29/chicago-faculty-object-their-campuss-confucius-institute#sthash.YZsyYMpg.dpbs Rejecting Confucius funding], ''Inside Higher Ed'', 29 April 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;

Media widely reported on this protest by U. of C. faculty. Historian [[Bruce Cumings]], who signed the petition, noted that China had recently fired prominent faculty members for their political views, and warned, "American universities should not be taking money or institute funds from governments that are jailing professors and that do not provide academic freedom in their own country."&lt;ref&gt;Harini Jaganathan and Alice Xiao, [http://chicagomaroon.com/2014/05/02/confucius-insitute-protested-by-faculty/ Confucius Institute protested by faculty], ''Chicago Maroon'', 2 May 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Anthony C.

On 25 September 2014, the [[University of Chicago]] stated that they had suspended negotiations to renew its CI contract because "recently published comments about UChicago in an article about the director-general of Hanban are incompatible with a continued equal partnership."&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.uchicago.edu/article/2014/09/25/statement-confucius-institute-university-chicago Statement on the Confucius Institute at the University of Chicago] 25 September 2014&lt;/ref&gt; This referred to Xu Lin's interview with the ''[[Jiefang Daily]]'', the official newspaper of the Communist Party in Shanghai.&lt;ref&gt;[http://newspaper.jfdaily.com/jfrb/html/2014-09/19/content_17605.htm 文化的困境, 在于不知不觉], Jiefang Daily, 19 September 2014&lt;/ref&gt; The article states that following the UChicago faculty petition, Xu Lin wrote a letter to Chicago's president and called the university representative in Beijing (where Chicago has a research center), "with only one line: 'If your school decides to withdraw, I will agree to it.' Her attitude made the other side anxious. The school quickly responded that it will continue to properly manage the Confucius Institute."&lt;ref name="insidehighered.com"&gt;[https://www.insidehighered.com/news/2014/09/26/chicago-severs-ties-chinese-government-funded-confucius-institute Chicago to Close Confucius Institute], Inside Higher Ed, 26 September 2014&lt;/ref&gt; Hanban Vice Director Hu Zhiping responded to Chicago's decision with a written statement: "Hanban thinks it’s a pity that the University of Chicago has made the public statement before finding out the truth. Since Confucius Institute is a collaboration program, both sides can make a choice." [[Dali Yang]], the Chicago CI director, said the institute would continue to support existing projects after the current five-year agreement expired on 29 September.

Several UChicago faculty members commented on the CI closure. [[Bruce Lincoln]], Professor of the History of Religions at Chicago, summarized the lengthy negotiations; the university administrators "accurately represented the institution's core values" when they argued against having a CI on campus, while the Chinese officials were "heavy-handed, condescending, and difficult."&lt;ref name="insidehighered.com"/&gt; Marshall Sahlins, an emeritus professor who helped lead the fight against the CI, said the newspaper article "fulsomely" praised Xu Lin,&lt;ref name="World should watch for Confucius"&gt;[http://www.chinapost.com.tw/commentary/the-china-post/frank-ching/2014/10/01/418395/World-should.htm World should watch for Confucius], The China Post, 1 October 2014&lt;/ref&gt; and told ''The Wall Street Journal'', "They knew that this was a dubious operation to begin with. They knew that there was a large opposition from an important segment of the faculty. And then, given that, the newspaper report simply triggered or changed the balance definitively."&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.wsj.com/articles/university-of-chicago-cuts-ties-with-chinese-academic-center-1411773300 Wall Street Journal: University of Chicago Cuts Ties With Chinese Academic Center], Wall Street Journal, 27 September 2014&lt;/ref&gt;

Gary Rawnsley, a British expert on international communication, said that Xu Lin could not have picked a worse time "to assert her imaginary authority", and the ''[[Business Spectator]]'' concluded this hardline behavior highlights one of the biggest problems for Beijing's charm offensive. "It still relies on officials like Xu, who still think and act like party ideologues who like to assert their authority and bully people into submission."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.businessspectator.com.au/article/2014/9/29/china/hard-times-chinas-soft-power Hard times for China's soft power], Business Spectator, 29 September 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;

''[[The Economist]]'' called Xu Lin's statement "a boastful challenge" and said opponents of Confucius Institutes will claim this as a victory for academic freedom.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.economist.com/blogs/analects/2014/09/confucius-institutes Confucius Institutes About-Face], The Economist, 26 September 2014&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[The Diplomat]]'' said that the current CI program of 465 institutes is heavily weighted toward the West, with 97 located in the U.S. but only 95 institutes in all of Asia. However, if backlash in the West continues to grow, the number of CIs "may plateau in the West while there remains immense potential for growth in other regions", including Africa, the Middle East, and Latin America.&lt;ref&gt;[http://thediplomat.com/2014/09/the-future-of-chinas-confucius-institutes/ The Future of China's Confucius Institutes], The Diplomat, 30 September 2014&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Jae Park(2013),[https://dx.doi.org/10.1080/09620214.2013.770205/ Cultural artifact, ideology export or soft power?

The official newspaper of the Communist party, the ''[[People's Daily]]'' responded to the University of Chicago's closure of its Confucius Institute.&lt;ref&gt;[http://english.people.com.cn/n/2014/0928/c90780-8789083.html Rejecting Confucius Institutes not helpful to understand China], ''Peoples' Daily'', 28 September 2014&lt;/ref&gt;

On 1 October 2014, [[Pennsylvania State University]] confirmed that it would close its Confucius Institute on 13 December 2014 when the contract expires, with its dean saying through a written statement that several of the university's goals are "not consistent with those of the Office of Chinese Languages Council International, known as the Hanban, which provides support to Confucius Institutes throughout the world."&lt;ref name="Confucius Institute update"&gt;[http://www.la.psu.edu/news/confucius-institute-update Confucius Institute update], Penn State College of Liberal Arts, 1 October 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;

In an interview, a former director of the Penn State Confucius Institute, Eric Hayot, said he suspected that the Confucius Institute may not have been providing enough of a return on its investment. "I will say that in my experience as CI director one of the major frustrations with the relationship was that we consistently had more ambitious ideas for the ways CI funding could be used", such as research projects proposed by Penn State professors on topics concerning the environment, science, and politics. He said the Hanban regularly rejected such proposals "too far outside the official CI ambit (which they would tell us was mainly 'cultural'),"&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.insidehighered.com/quicktakes/2014/10/01/another-confucius-institute-close Another Confucius Institute to Close], Inside Higher Ed, 1 October 2014&lt;/ref&gt;  "A lot of what the Hanban wanted us to do didn’t make sense given our institution, faculty population, and student population," said Professor Hayot, who was not involved in the CI contract negotiations this summer. "Had they been flexible, it would have helped Confucius Institute succeed here."&lt;ref&gt;[http://sinosphere.blogs.nytimes.com/2014/10/02/penn-state-severs-ties-to-confucius-institute/ Another U.S. University Severs Ties to Confucius Institute], The New York Times, 2 October 2014&lt;/ref&gt;

''The Telegraph'' said China's effort to project soft power "has suffered another serious setback", and the UChicago and Penn State closures represent a major blow to China's attempt at using the government-funded institutes to improve its image around the world.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/northamerica/usa/11133921/China-soft-power-set-back-as-US-universities-shut-second-Confucius-Institute-in-a-week.html China soft power set back as US universities shut second Confucius Institute in a week], The Telegraph, 1 October 2014&lt;/ref&gt;

Henry Reichman, a vice president of the AAUP and chairman of the committee that issued a statement condemning Confucius Institutes, said, "There is clearly a growing sense that these academic centers need to be looked at a little more carefully ... I suspect U Chicago and Penn State won't be the only ones to come to the conclusion that a relationship with these institutes is not really worth it."&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.wsj.com/articles/penn-state-latest-school-to-drop-chinas-confucius-institute-1412196655 Penn State Latest School to Drop China's Confucius Institute], The Wall Street Journal, 1 October 2014&lt;/ref&gt;

A ''[[Bloomberg News]]'' editorial mentioned the three CI closures within two weeks, and says, "If the institutes are meant to be insidious vehicles of Chinese soft-power indoctrination, they're doing a terrible job.

Fellow Greens MP [[Jamie Parker (politician)|Jamie Parker]] organized a petition with more than 10,000 signatures, calling for removing the Confucius Classroom Program from local schools.&lt;ref name="inner-west-courier.whereilive.com.au"&gt;Tyson Butson, [http://inner-west-courier.whereilive.com.au/news/story/greens-attack-reds/ Greens want to axe Chinese cultural classes], ''Inner West Courier'' 13 October 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; NSW Minister for Education [[Adrian Piccoli]] defended the classes, and noted the Chinese language syllabuses did not include the study of political content.&lt;ref&gt;Anna Patty, [http://www.smh.com.au/national/education/call-to-scrap-biased-chinese-culture-classes-20110712-1hcdf.html Call to scrap 'biased' Chinese culture classes], The Sydney Morning Herald, 13 July 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; Shuangyuan Shi, director of Confucius Institute in Sydney, noted the institute primarily focuses on language, and teachers are not there to draw conclusions for students in regards to controversial subjects.&lt;ref name="inner-west-courier.whereilive.com.au"/&gt; Senior Department of Education officials acknowledge the institutes play an important role in fostering greater literacy in Asian languages, they admit to concerns about China's influence over the program's content.

After the [[University of Sydney]]'s Institute for Democracy and Human Rights organized a 2013 talk by the Dalai Lama, the university warned that they could not use its logo, allow media coverage, or permit entry to the event by Tibet activists—forcing organizers to move the event off campus. University officials decided, "there was a better way of doing it. A small group, a small section of the student body, was really not the best thing." [[Sarah Hanson-Young]], an [[Australian Greens]] senator, said "As a democratic country, we should be encouraging more open and frank discussion about the current situation in Tibet, not banning the country's spiritual leader from addressing students and staff at universities." A spokesperson for the activist [[Australia Tibet Council]] said the university had given in to China. "They have compromised their academic freedom and integrity, and it also sends a disheartening message to the Tibetan people," more than 100 of whom have died in recent [[self-immolation protests by Tibetans in China|self-immolation protests]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/apr/18/sydney-university-dalai-lama Sydney University criticised for blocking Dalai Lama visit], ''The Guardian'', 18 April 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; June Teufel Dreyer, a [[University of Miami]] (Florida) professor of political science, claims that Confucius Institutes have distorted history, citing universities in Australia inviting speakers "to shill for the government and talk about how happy all the Tibetans were".&lt;ref name="Marcus 2013"/&gt; A Joint Conference of Australia's 13 Confucius Institutes was held in Sydney on 4 September 2014, intending to increase the CI network's "visibility in Australia’s industry and public policy making communities".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aph.gov.au/About_Parliament/Parliamentary_Departments/Parliamentary_Library/FlagPost/2014/November/Confucius_Institutes_and_Chinese_soft_power_in_Australia Confucius Institutes and Chinese soft power in Australia], ''FlagPost'', Parliament of Australia, 24 November 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Canada===
In December 2013, the [[Canadian Association of University Teachers]] passed a resolution calling on all Canadian universities and colleges that currently host CIs on their campuses to cease doing so, and those contemplating such arrangements to pursue them no further. This action followed upon the [[Université de Sherbrooke]] in Quebec closing its Confucius Institute,&lt;ref name="theglobeandmail.com"&gt;Caroline Alphonso and Karen Howlett, [https://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/toronto/toronto-school-board-seeks-end-to-china-deal/article19651681/ Toronto school board seeks end to China deal], The Globe and Mail, 17 July 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; the [[University of Manitoba]] voting against hosting a CI out of concerns over political censorship, and [[McMaster University]] cancelling its CI contract following an instructor's human rights complaint. CAUT executive director James Turk said Canadian universities that agree to host CIs are compromising their own integrity by allowing the Hanban to have a voice in academic matters such as curriculum, texts, and topics of class discussion, describing such interference as a "fundamental violation of academic freedom."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.caut.ca/news/2013/12/17/universities-and-colleges-urged-to-end-ties-with-confucius-institutes Universities and colleges urged to end ties with Confucius Institutes], Canadian Association of University Teachers, 17 December 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; Turk described CIs as "essentially political arms of the Chinese government", which restrict the free discussion of topics Chinese authorities deem controversial, and "should have no place on our campuses."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.universitiesnews.com/2014/01/02/canadas-association-of-university-teachers-calls-on-universities-to-close-confucius-institutes/ Canada's Association of University Teachers Calls on Universities to Close Confucius Institutes], ''Universities News'', 25 December 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

At the 19 June 2014 meeting of the [[Toronto District School Board]], Canada's largest school board, trustees voted to postpone the planned September startup of a Confucius Institute, in order to more closely examine a 2012 agreement that chair Chris Bolton unilaterally negotiated with the Hanban. On the morning of the meeting, Bolton suddenly resigned and was not available to answer questions. Many trustees complained that they had not received enough information about the partnership and were caught off guard when they received hundreds of emails and phone calls from parents protesting against CIs.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/toronto/tdsb-delays-deal-with-china-s-confucius-institute-1.2680015 TDSB delays deal with China's Confucius Institute], CBC News, 18 June 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Moira MacDonald, [http://news.nationalpost.com/2014/06/18/toronto-public-school-board-delays-china-backed-confucius-institute-amid-fears-it-will-used-be-as-propaganda-tool/ Toronto public school board delays China-backed Confucius Institute amid fears it will used be as propaganda tool], National Post, 19 June 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; An editorial in ''The Globe and Mail'' said Bolton "showed a stunning lack of judgment", and warned that "the Confucius Institute functions as little more than a long arm of the Chinese state, pushing its political agenda under the guise of simple language instruction."&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theglobeandmail.com/globe-debate/editorials/confucius-institute-chinese-for-conflict-of-interest/article19401054/ Confucius Institute: Chinese for ‘conflict of interest’?], The Globe and Mail, 1 July 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; 
The deputy director-general of the [[Hunan]] Provincial Department of Education sent a letter to the TDSB that said, "If the Confucius Institute in Toronto was suspended, there would be a great damage to the relationship between the two sides, which is hard for us to accept."&lt;ref&gt;Caroline Alphonso and Karen Howlett, [https://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/national/education/toronto-school-boards-qualms-over-chinese-partnership-cause-backlash/article20166438/ Toronto school board’s qualms over Chinese partnership prompt backlash], ''The Globe and Mail'', 22 August 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://toronto.ctvnews.ca/tdsb-votes-to-delay-partnership-with-confucius-institute-1.1875899 TDSB Votes to Delay Partnership with Confucius Institute], CTV News Toronto, 18 June 2014&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.thestar.com/yourtoronto/education/2014/06/26/why_the_uproar_over_the_tdsbs_partnership_with_the_confucius_institute.html Why the uproar over the TDSB’s partnership with the Confucius Institute?], The Star, 26 June 2014&lt;/ref&gt;

On 30 September 2014, the TDSB's Planning and Priorities Committee voted to terminate the Confucius Institute program, leaving the final decision to the full board meeting at the end of October. TDSB chair Mari Rutka declared she did not feel reassured that going forward would be a good move, and said, "There have been too many concerns raised, I think, again, we have the examples of a number of other institutions that have decided not to go on with this."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/toronto/hundreds-demonstrate-over-tdsb-confucius-institute-partnership-1.2784776 Hundreds demonstrate over TDSB-Confucius Institute partnership], CBC News Toronto, 1 October 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; Trustees said they had heard both sides of the argument, and received pressure from both parents alarmed over China's control of the programs and from Chinese officials who warned them that dissolving the partnership would endanger the TDSB's most lucrative market for fee-paying international students.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/world/tdsb-votes-to-stop-confucius-institute/article20888419/ Toronto school committee votes to end Confucius Institute programs], The Globe and Mail, 1 October 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; The CI issue has been contentious, involving a website and petitions.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.saynotoci.ca/ Say No To C.I., Stop China's Institute in TBSD]&lt;/ref&gt; The committee heard from 10 speakers, half against the contract (including a former [[Canadian Security Intelligence Service]] Asia/Pacific chief who warned the institutes are a "Trojan horse"), and half in favor (a spokesperson from the Confederation of Chinese Canadian Organizations in Toronto who said the issue was not political but "about culture and language").&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.thestar.com/yourtoronto/education/2014/10/01/tdsb_committee_votes_to_cut_ties_with_controversial_confucius_institute.html TDSB committee votes to cut ties with controversial Confucius Institute], The Star, 5 October 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; A newspaper editorial described CIs as state-supported, state-directed entities controlled by a "one-party regime that recently evolved from Marxism-Leninism into what can be best described as a novel form of non-democratic elitism with kleptocratic tendencies."&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theglobeandmail.com/globe-debate/editorials/theres-no-room-for-beijing-in-canadas-schools/article20898741/ There’s no room for Beijing in Canada’s schools], The Globe and Mail, 2 October 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;

At the 30 October 2014 full meeting, the TDSB voted 20-2 to cancel the CI contract. Trustee Pamela Gough said her concern was that "the Confucius Institute is directly controlled by the Communist Party of China, and there is irrefutable evidence that the party exerts its influence through [the institute]".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ibtimes.com/toronto-district-school-board-votes-cancel-confucius-institute-partnership-after-local-1715976 Toronto District School Board Votes To Cancel Confucius Institute Partnership After Local Opposition], ''International Business Times'', 30 October 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="scmp.com"&gt;[http://www.scmp.com/news/world/article/1628071/toronto-schools-reject-tie-chinas-confucius-institute Toronto schools reject tie-up with China’s Confucius Institute], ''South China Morning Post'', 30 October 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; In response to the TDSB rejection, an [[op-ed]] from the state-run ''China Daily'' called the criticisms "unfair" and accused CI critics of having "a deep bias against China".&lt;ref&gt;[http://usa.chinadaily.com.cn/opinion/2014-10/30/content_18826273.htm Criticism of Confucius Institutes unfair], ''China Daily'', 30 October 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; David Mulroney, a former [[List of Canadian ambassadors to China|Canadian ambassador to China]], said, "We're seeing really the end of the free ride that Confucius Institutes have had, particularly in North America".&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/toronto/toronto-school-board-votes-to-sever-ties-to-confucius-institute/article21376636/ TDSB votes to officially cut ties with Confucius Institute], ''The Globe and Mail'', 29 October 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Scandinavia===

In December 2014, [[Stockholm University]], the first university in Europe to host a Confucius Institute, announced it was terminating the program. Press coverage of the Braga incident in the Swedish press was said to have influenced the decision. "Generally it is questionable to have, within the framework of the university, institutes that are financed by another country," said the university's chancellor.&lt;ref&gt;[https://networks.h-net.org/node/22055/discussions/56521/stockholm-university-terminating-its-confucius-institute Stockholm University terminating its Confucius Institute]&lt;/ref&gt; No major university in Sweden and Denmark now hosts a Confucius Institute.

A censorship effort by the Confucius Institute's international director [[Xu Lin (Hanban)|Xu Lin]] against Taiwan occurred in Portugal in July 2014.&lt;ref&gt;Peter Cai, [http://www.businessspectator.com.au/article/2014/8/6/china/china-fails-soft-power-test], [[Business Spectator]], 6 August 2014.

On the first day of the annual conference of the [[European Association for Chinese Studies]] (EACS), with several hundred attendees, Xu Lin ordered the programs seized. Four pages were torn out of the program before they were re-issued to conference attendees the next day.

The president of the EACS ordered 500 copies of the deleted pages to be distributed to attendees and issued a report on the incident. The U.S. online university site [[Inside Higher Ed]] quoted [[Marshall Sahlins]], professor emeritus at the [[University of Chicago]] and a leading critic of the Confucius Institutes, who said that this incident illustrated the Confucius Institutes provision that programming they fund must abide by Chinese laws, including those restricting speech; "Moreover they’re going to enforce them the way they do in China, which is not so much by going to court... but simply by fiat."&lt;ref&gt;Elizabeth Redden [https://www.insidehighered.com/news/2014/08/06/accounts-confucius-institute-ordered-censorship-chinese-studies-conference], "[[Inside Higher Ed]]", "Censorship at China Studies Meeting", 6 August 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; Taiwan's cabinet-level [[Mainland Affairs Council]] issued a reproach over the censorship incident, saying, "The mainland should deal with Taiwan's participation in activities on international occasions pragmatically. If there is no respect for each other, the development of [[Cross-Strait relations|cross-strait relations]] will be seriously hurt."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.chinapost.com.tw/taiwan/china-taiwan-relations/2014/07/29/413535/Chinas-obstruction.htm], "[[The China Post]]", "China's Obstruction at Conference Hurts Ties", 29 July 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;

''[[The Christian Science Monitor]]'' reported that the censorship has made more academics in the US, UK, Canada, and Australia grow uneasy with Confucius Institutes.&lt;ref&gt;Robert Marquand, [http://www.csmonitor.com/World/Asia-Pacific/2014/0822/Academic-flap-turns-up-heat-on-China-s-Confucius-Institutes Academic flap turns up heat on China's Confucius Institutes], ''The Christian Science Monitor'', 22 August 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Eamonn Fingleton]] suggests that perhaps the most embarrassing aspect of the whole Braga Incident is that Beijing has reversed itself on the "hot-button issue at the center of the entire controversy. After vehemently denying for years that the Confucius Institutes have any kind of censorship agenda, Beijing has now tacitly acknowledged that this was false."&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.forbes.com/sites/eamonnfingleton/2014/08/31/is-this-american-academes-most-shameful-moment/ Is This American Academe's Most Shameful Moment?], Forbes, 31 September 2014&lt;/ref&gt;

===Russia===
On 27 July 2015, a prosecutor filed a complaint to the city court in [[Blagoveshchensk]] [[Amur Oblast]], [[Russia]], asking that the court shut down the [[Blagoveschensk State Pedagogical University]] Confucius Institute on the grounds that it is violating Russian law by not being registered as a non-commercial organization, and thus, foreign teachers have no legal grounds to work at the institute. The prosecutor's statement said that instead of being a part of the university, the CI should be registered as a foreign cultural center.&lt;ref&gt;Ivan Nechepurenko, [http://www.themoscowtimes.com/news/article/prosecutors-in-russias-far-east-want-chinese-culture-center-shut-down/526280.html Prosecutors in Russia's Far East Want Chinese Culture Center Shut Down], ''The Moscow Times'', 27 July 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Confucius Classrooms ==
The Confucius Classroom program partners with local secondary schools or school districts to provide teachers and instructional materials.

===United Kingdom===

Campaign groups raised concerns about Confucius Classrooms in the UK in 2015. Isabel Hilton, a broadcaster and writer whose own work was censored by the Confucius Institute, said: "State control undertaking in China in the teaching of culture means contestation is not really allowed. If this is happening in our schools where people are not familiar with the Chinese buying their way into our education system, we ought to ask serious questions about whether that's a good thing."&lt;ref name="espinoza2015"&gt;Espinoza, Javier (30 March 2015).

The [[Bibb County Public School District]], which includes [[Macon, Georgia]], mandated that Mandarin Chinese would become a required subject for every student, pre-K through 12th grade. Although the superintendent described the agreement for the Confucius Classroom to supply the Chinese language teachers as "a win-win for everyone," some parents were critical. A few feared a "Communist regime enacting its geopolitical agenda on their children", but most had practical concerns, such as whether local students would benefit more from learning Spanish than Chinese as a foreign language.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.npr.org/2012/09/08/160028396/looking-to-future-ga-schools-require-mandarin Some Ga.

In 2011, the instructor hiring policies posted publicly on Hanban's website stated that candidates for teaching positions should be "aged between 22 and 60, {{sic|physical and mental}} healthy, no record of participation in Falun Gong and other illegal organizations, and no criminal record".&lt;ref&gt;Hanban, [https://www.webcitation.org/64a6u7UuU?url=http://www.chinese.cn/hanban_en/node_9806.htm 'Overseas Volunteer Chinese Teacher Program'], Hanban.

In 2012, ''The Globe and Mail'' reported that Sonia Zhao quit her teaching position at [[McMaster University]]'s Confucius Institute in [[Hamilton, Ontario]], and sought political asylum in Canada based on [[religious discrimination]]. In a complaint filed to the [[Human Rights Tribunal of Ontario]], Ms. Zhao stated she was forced to hide her belief in the [[Falun Gong]] spiritual movement, which the Chinese government calls an illegal "evil cult", and argued that McMaster "is giving legitimization to discrimination." She told an interviewer that during her CI training in Beijing, she was told that if students asked about Tibet or other sensitive topics, "Don’t talk about this. If the student insists, you just try to change the topic, or say something the Chinese Communist Party would prefer." Andrea Farquhar, McMaster's assistant vice-president of public and government affairs, said the university was "looking for clarity" from its Chinese partners on aspects of their agreement, notably hiring practices. Having lent its name to the Confucius Institute on its campus, Ms. Farquhar said McMaster was insisting that Canadian laws and expectations be respected.&lt;ref name="Colin Freeze 2012"&gt;Colin Freeze, James Bradshaw, and Mark Mackinnon [https://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/world/are-schools-too-eager-to-forge-chinese-ties/article4353705 Canadian universities, colleges confront questions about Chinese ties], ''The Globe and Mail'', 19 June 2012, updated 10 October 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://chinadigitaltimes.net/2012/06/controversy-continues-confucius-institutes/ Controversy continues over Confucius Institutes], ''[[China Digital Times]]'', 20 June 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; In 2013, McMaster University announced they would close their Confucius Institute.&lt;ref&gt;[http://dailynews.mcmaster.ca/worth-mentioning/confucius-institute-will-complete-its-work-at-mcmaster-this-summer/ Confucius Institute will complete its work at McMaster this summer], McMaster University ''The Daily News'', 7 February 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; Andrea Farquhar explained that after months of making a concerted effort to save their 5-year partnership with Hanban, "We were uncomfortable, and felt that it didn’t reflect the way the university would do hiring", and explained that McMaster's Chinese partners replied with a letter expressing "some disappointment."&lt;ref name="Colin Freeze 2013"&gt;James Bradshaw and Colin Freeze, [https://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/national/education/mcmaster-closing-confucius-institute-over-hiring-issues/article8372894/ McMaster closing Confucius Institute over hiring issues], ''The Globe and Mail'', 7 February 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; Ms. Zhao, a Chinese citizen, has since been granted refugee status in Canada.&lt;ref name="Marcus 2013"/&gt;

==Closures==
While many universities (such as the [[University of Pennsylvania]] and [[University of Manitoba]]) have refused Hanban offers to host Confucius Institutes, a few hosting universities have decided to terminate their 5-year renewable CI contracts: 1 Japanese university in 2010, 1 French and 2 Canadian in 2013, 1 Canadian, 1 Swedish, and 2 American universities in 2014, and one German university in 2015. Regarding the recent international closures of Confucius Institutes, a July 2015 article in ''The Diplomat'' said that although nations like Japan use soft power to promote positive images of themselves for the sake of political profit, China uses soft power for lies and censorship, but the world "sees through its con".&lt;ref&gt;[http://thediplomat.com/2015/07/chinas-confucius-institutes-and-the-soft-war/ China's Confucius Institutes and the Soft War], ''The Diplomat'', 8 July 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;

===McMaster University===
On 7 February 2013, Canada's [[McMaster University]] terminated its CI contract owing to an instructor's human rights complaint and the university's lack of control over hiring CI employees. The Hanban replied with a letter expressing "some disappointment."&lt;ref name="Colin Freeze 2013"/&gt; In the previous year, Sonia Zhao, a Chinese national, quit her teaching position at McMaster's Confucius Institute and sought political asylum in Canada based on [[religious discrimination]]. Ms. Zhao filed a complaint with the [[Human Rights Tribunal of Ontario]], stating that McMaster was "giving legitimization to discrimination" because she was forced to hide her belief in the [[Falun Gong]] spiritual movement, for which the Hanban would fire her. The university insisted that the Confucius Institute respect Canadian laws and expectations on hiring and firing practices.&lt;ref name="Colin Freeze 2012"/&gt;

===University of Lyon===
On 24 September 2013, France's [[University of Lyon]] closed their Confucius Institute at [[Lumière University Lyon 2]] and [[Jean Moulin University Lyon 3]], which had been established in 2009. [[Gregory B. Lee]], board chair of the CI said its director was "taking his instructions directly from Beijing" and "questioned the content of our courses."&lt;ref name="World should watch for Confucius"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gregorylee.net/ Gregory B. Lee: Professional Pages].&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Université de Sherbrooke ===
On 31 December 2013, Canada's [[Université de Sherbrooke]] in Quebec closed their Confucius Institute after months of failed negotiations, saying that the Hanban arrangement no longer met the university's international plans.&lt;ref name="theglobeandmail.com"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rcinet.ca/en/2014/09/09/university-teachers-call-for-an-end-to-confucius-institutes/ University teachers call for an end to Confucius Institutes], Radio Canada International, 9 September 2014&lt;/ref&gt; On 17 December 2013, the [[Canadian Association of University Teachers]] passed a resolution calling on all Canadian universities and colleges that currently host CIs on their campuses to cease doing so, and those contemplating such arrangements to pursue them no further. Of the six Canadian universities that sent replies to the CAUT, only the Université de Sherbrooke said it would be severing ties with the CI.

Montreal's [[Dawson College]], which partnered with Université de Sherbrooke in 2007 to establish the Confucius Institute in Quebec, decided to continue hosting. Agents from the [[Canadian Security Intelligence Service]] interviewed Meng Rong, director of the CI in Quebec, showed her a list of names, and asked if she could identify anyone. Meng told an interviewer that the CI had "nothing to do with politics or spying".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/montreal/local-chinese-school-visited-by-csis-director-says-1.2759399 Local Chinese school visited by CSIS, director says], CBC News Montreal, 8 September 2014&lt;/ref&gt;

===University of Chicago===
On 25 September 2014, the [[University of Chicago]] suspended lengthy negotiations to renew its Confucius Institute contract, citing director-general Xu Lin's boastful claims in the official Communist ''[[Jiefang Daily]]'' that she made the university fear cancelling with one sentence—"If your school decides to withdraw, I will agree to it."&lt;ref name="insidehighered.com"/&gt;

===Pennsylvania State University===
On 1 October 2014, [[Pennsylvania State University]] announced that it will discontinue hosting a Confucius Institute at the end of the year when their contract expires. The university spokesperson said their goals are not consistent with those of the Hanban, or Office of Chinese Languages Council International.&lt;ref name="Confucius Institute update"/&gt;

===Toronto District School Board===
On 30 October 2014, the [[Toronto District School Board]], which oversees public schools with 232,000 students, voted to cancel their CI contract. Trustee Pamela Gough said it was clear that "this partnership is not aligned with TDSB and community values, and its continuation is not appropriate."&lt;ref name="scmp.com"/&gt;

===Stockholm University===
On 20 December 2014 Stockholm University, Sweden, announced that the Stockholm Confucius Institute will be closed by the end of June 2015.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.su.se/om-oss/press-media-nyheter/nyheter/beslut-taget-om-avveckling-av-institut-1.216304]&lt;/ref&gt; According to the vice-chancellor of Stockholm University the new contracts for the Confucius Institutes are not in line with how Swedish universities are governed.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dn.se/nyheter/kontroversiellt-institut-laggs-ned]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Stuttgart Media University and University of Hohenheim===
In 2014, the Hanban signed a contract with the [[Hochschule der Medien|Stuttgart Media University]] and [[University of Hohenheim]] to open a CI in [[Stuttgart, Germany]], but in June 2015, the universities abandoned the plan. A spokesperson blamed the decision on a failure to find the necessary support for the Confucius Institute,&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.insidehighered.com/quicktakes/2015/06/08/german-university-abandons-plans-confucius-institute German University Abandons Plans for Confucius Institute], ''Inside Higher Ed'', 8 June 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; nonetheless, a [[Students for a Free Tibet]] press release said their "Say No to Confucius Institutes" campaign's opposition to the Stuttgart plan had been successful, and declared a victory for democratic values and academic freedom worldwide.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.heraldscotland.com/news/13211073.Worldwide_campaign_launched_against_Confucius_Institutes/ Worldwide campaign launched against Confucius Institutes], ''The Sunday Herald'', 24 April 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.studentsforafreetibet.org/media-center/press-releases/press-releases/first-china-backed-confucius-institute-shutdown-in-germany First China-backed Confucius Institute shutdown in Germany, Tibet Campaigners declare victory], ''Students for a Free Tibet'', 3 June 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Cultural governance''' is [[governance]] of [[culture]]. It includes [[cultural policy]] made by [[government]]s but extends also to cultural influence exerted by [[non-state actor]]s and to policies which influence culture indirectly.

== Meaning ==

The tendency to discuss cultural governance rather than policy corresponds to the broader shift from [[government]] to governance, with the emphasis shifting from state policymakers to include the influence of [[civil society organizations]] and the [[private sector]]. A broad interpretation of "governance" could also include government policies outside the scope of cultural policy which nevertheless impact culture.&lt;ref&gt;Schmitt (2011), pp. 48–49. “In order to be able to understand the governance of a cultural object, this must not just be considered alone, but also in the light of the often conflicting overlaps and interferences between different fields of governance that have an interest in the “cultural object”. Such considerations lead to the concept of cultural governance ''in the broad sense''. For example, the members of a theater ensemble may be bound by labour regulations, or the treatment of a historic building may be determined by fire prevention regulations or the specific interest of the users.”&lt;/ref&gt;

The precise meaning of "cultural governance" also depends heavily on the definition of culture, which can range from narrow reference to institutions like [[museum]]s and [[concert hall]]s connected with [[the arts]] to broad meanings such as a society’s [[Lifestyle (sociology)|way of life]] or its systems of [[knowledge]] and [[symbol]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Schmitt (2011), pp. 11–18. Concepts or ideas thus have a twofold dialectical relationship with human agency on the one hand, and institutions on the other hand: concepts or ideas have a discursive influence on human agency, shaping actions, whether consciously, practically or unconsciously (see also Giddens 1984, Werlen 1997: 153). However, when actors take up ideas and appropriate them for themselves, they can change them, or they can create new ideas; they do not always have to act as passive recipients and actualizers of discourses. There is also a dialectical relationship between ideas and concepts on the one hand, and institutions on the other hand; but strictly speaking this relationship is always mediated by human agency. Political institutions (such as UNESCO) can take up and spread ideas, and can also reshape them. Ideas and institutions mutually “frame” each other (for a neo-Gramscian view, see Bøås/ McNeill 2004). / Ideas, symbols, concepts constitute one pole of the cultural sphere, while the other pole is made up of actions and practices (especially rituals and performances) and the material (or digital) artefacts in which concepts, ideas, senses and meanings are manifested.”&lt;/ref&gt; In the broader view, cultural governance deals holistically with the production of meaning in a society, through aspects including the [[culture industry]], the formation of [[taste (sociology)|taste]], and the use of [[language]].&lt;ref name=Schmitt2009&gt;Thomas M. Schmitt, “[https://www.erdkunde.uni-bonn.de/archive/2009/global-cultural-governance.-decision-making-concerning-world-heritage-between-politics-and-science Global Cultural Governance: Decision-Making Concerning World Heritage Between Politics and Science]”; ''[[Erdkunde]]'' 63(2), 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Global ==

The dominant actor in global cultural governance is [[UNESCO]], a United Nations specialized agency created in 1946 and headquartered in Paris, France.&lt;ref name=DuxburyJeannotte2013 /&gt; UNESCO produces documents which local governments frequently use as guidelines and may incorporate into law. It has also promoted the development of networks such as the Global Alliance for Cultural Diversity to promote [[public/social/private partnership]] in the cultural area. In recent years{{when|date=September 2017}} the organization has emphasized the importance of [[cities]] (with non-profit organizations participating in local governance) as cultural actors with networks such as the [[International Coalition of Cities Against Racism]] and the [[Creative Cities Network]].&lt;ref name=DuxburyJeannotte2013&gt;Nancy Duxbury &amp; Sharon Jeannotte, "[http://www.ces.uc.pt/myces/UserFiles/livros/1097_Global_Cultural_Governance_Policy_Duxbury-Jeannotte_2013.pdf Global Cultural Governance Policy]"; Chapter 21 in ''The Ashgate Research Companion to Planning and Culture''; London: Ashgate, 2013. "While global entities such as the World Bank or the World Trade  Organization have  played roles in global cultural governance, the primary actor in this policy area over the past 40 or 50 years has been the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO)."&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:C21 trilingue.jpg|thumb|Logo of [[Agenda 21 for culture]]]]

UNESCO itself relies upon partnerships with the [[private sector]] in selecting, developing, and promoting [[World Heritage Site]]s.&lt;ref name=DuxburyJeannotte2013 /&gt; Meetings for the selection of these sites attract several hundred attendees, including representatives of interested groups. "World heritage" issues gain prominence through promotion in the [[mass media]] with publications such as ''[[National Geographic (magazine)|National Geographic]]'' and many others. All steps of the process promote the development of a [[metaculture]] capable of adjudicating global cultural issues and producing a global [[literary canon]] from a vantage point of [[Universality (philosophy)|universality]].&lt;ref name=Schmitt2009 /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Barbara Kirshenblatt-Gimblett, “[https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Barbara_Kirshenblatt-Gimblett/publication/227993210_Intangible_Heritage_as_Metacultural_Production1/links/551acdb60cf2fdce8437efb3/Intangible-Heritage-as-Metacultural-Production1.pdf Intangible Heritage as Metacultural Production]”; ''Museum International'', June 2004; [[doi:10.1111/j.1350-0775.2004.00458.x]].&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Agenda 21 for culture]], administered by an international organization called [[United Cities and Local Governments]], represents a vector for [[global governance]] conducted by its members at a local level.&lt;ref name=DuxburyJeannotte2013 /&gt; This concept endorses "culture as a fourth pillar of sustainable development", adding to the three pillars of [[sustainable development]] identified in [[Agenda 21]]: economy, society, and environment.&lt;ref name=DuxburyJeannotte2013 /&gt;

=== European Union ===

Cultural governance in the European Union includes a range of [[Cultural policies of the European Union|cultural policies]] geared toward promoting European culture.{{cn|date=September 2017}}

The [[European Commission]]'s 2007 communication "on a European agenda for culture in a globalizing world" describes interaction with culture through a various channels, including support for and consultation with [[cultural organization]]s, encouragement of artist mobility and [[intercultural communication]], use of European culture in international relations, maintenance of [[Copyright law of the European Union|EU copyright law]], and promotion of European cultural goods and services.&lt;ref&gt;Commission of the European Communities, ''[http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=COM:2007:0242:FIN:EN:PDF Communication from the Commission to the European Parliament, the Council, the European Economic and Social Committee and the Committee of the Regions]''; Brussels, 10 May 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Smith2015&gt;Rachael Craufurd Smith, “The Cultural Logic of Economic Integration”; in Psychogiopoulou (2015).&lt;/ref&gt; The European governments consider it necessary to promote and guide cultural development actively because of deficiencies in cultural outcomes of the [[free market]]. Further, intercultural communication and integration are considered intertwined with [[economic integration]].&lt;ref name=Smith2015 /&gt;

=== China ===
[[File:024 - Peaceful Liberation Monument.jpg|thumb|The [[Monument to the Peaceful Liberation of Tibet]] in [[Lhasa]], Tibet, exemplifies [[public art]] with a political objective.{{cn|date=September 2017}}]] 
In the [[China|People's Republic of China]] a major goal of cultural governance is to reinforce the legitimacy of the government.&lt;ref name=Perry2013 /&gt; Culture has long played a role in the governance of China, from the harmonious society promoted by [[Confucianism]] to the [[Cultural Revolution]] and other [[Chinese Communist Party]] strategies for transforming [[Chinese social structure|traditional society]] into [[Chinese industrialization|industrialized]] communism. Present-day Chinese leaders have made significant references in speeches to a continual tradition of [[Chinese culture]] and its importance for [[nationalism|nationalist]] and [[geopolitics|geopolitical]] purposes. Cultural governance is integrated with [[Propaganda in the People's Republic of China|propaganda]], [[Censorship in China|censorship]], [[political music in China|music]], and [[education in China|education]].&lt;ref name=Perry2013&gt;[[Elizabeth J. Perry]], ''[https://dash.harvard.edu/handle/1/11386987 Cultural Governance in Contemporary China: “Re-Orienting” Party Propaganda]''; Harvard-Yenching Institute Working Paper Series, 2013. "Despite such monumental ideological and institutional changes, however, the contemporary Chinese state also leans heavily on cultural governance. While far from 'traditional' in its espoused secularism and embrace of a 'scientific development outlook,' the PRC continues to devote considerable attention and energy to the exercise of symbolic power as a means to affirm its right to rule. [...] China's rulers today are quite explicit in the high value they put on cultural governance. They are almost equally explicit in their instrumental use of cultural governance for nationalistic ends."&lt;/ref&gt; Within the Chinese [[Ministry of Culture of the People's Republic of China|Ministry of Culture]], the [[State Administration of Cultural Heritage]] has stated that China's [[cultural heritage]] should be used to "strengthen national unity and promote sustainable development of the natural culture".&lt;ref name=ShepherdYu2013p50&gt;Shepherd &amp; Yu (2013), pp. 49–51.&lt;/ref&gt;

Localities in China have assumed much of the responsibility for identifying heritage sites, with the result that 300,000 such sites have been declared, many without state protection and support. Local governments have frequently turned to private companies to [[cultural heritage management|manage]] these sites and operate [[tourism in China|tourism businesses]].&lt;ref name=ShepherdYu2013p50 /&gt;&lt;ref name=HuangRyanYang2013 /&gt; Sites may also come under many overlapping authorities, as in the case of [[Mount Wutai]], a national park and World Heritage Site, which is managed by eight government agencies and governed by 29 international, national, and local laws.&lt;ref&gt;Shepherd &amp; Yu (2013), p. 53. "Mount Wutai, a sacred Buddhist mountain area designated a national park in 1982 and inscribed as a world heritage site in 2009, illustrates this fragmented bureaucratic structure of competing interests. Overall management authority is shared by the Ministry of Housing and Urban–rural Development and the Construction Authority of Shanxi Province. But the park’s forest reserves are overseen by the State Forestry Administration, temple sites by the State Administration of Cultural Heritage, religious practice at temples and monasteries by the State Administration for Religious Affairs, geological sites by the Ministry of Geology, fossils by the Ministry of Land and Resources, and tourism by the National Tourism Administration. Finally, 29 different international, national, and provincial conventions, laws, and decrees impact the site (Shepherd 2012 ) . These range from the 1972 Convention on World Heritage and various State Council decrees on heritage protection to national laws regulating geological heritage (1995), forests (1998), fossils (2002), cultural relics (2003), religious practice (2004), and scenic areas (2006)."&lt;/ref&gt;

It was established in 2000, and was meant to develop a [[web portal]] for [[online trade]]. It was a cooperation between telecommunications company [[Telenor]] and [[Den norske Bank]]. Chairman was Petter Jansen, and among the board members were [[Gunn Wærsted]], [[Jon Fredrik Baksaas]] and [[Ingvild Myhre]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Hånd i hånd om e-handel|last=Egede-Nissen|first=Heidi|date=31 October 2000|work=Dagens Næringsliv|page=11|language=Norwegian}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Åpner for banktopper|last=Egede-Nissen|first=Heidi|date=18 January 2001|work=Dagens Næringsliv|page=7|language=Norwegian}}&lt;/ref&gt; The goal was to create the largest market place of its kind in Norway.

'''Estoppel''' is a judicial device in [[common law jurisdictions|common law legal systems]] whereby a [[court]] may prevent, or "estop" a person from making assertions or from going back on his or her word; the person being sanctioned is "estopped".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.duhaime.org/LegalDictionary/E/Estoppel.aspx|title=Estoppel Definition|publisher=Duhaime's Law Dictionary|accessdate=18 December 2015|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151222171456/http://www.duhaime.org/LegalDictionary/E/Estoppel.aspx|archivedate=22 December 2015|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''[[Black's Law Dictionary]]'' defines estoppel as a "bar or impediment raised by the law, which precludes a man from alleging or from denying a certain fact or state of facts, in consequence of his previous allegation or denial or conduct or admission, or in consequence of a final adjudication of the matter in a court of law".&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://thelawdictionary.org/estoppel/|title=Estoppel|publisher=''[[Black's Law Dictionary]]''|accessdate=18 December 2015|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151213120728/http://thelawdictionary.org/estoppel/|archivedate=13 December 2015|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Estoppel may prevent someone from  bringing a particular claim, particularly if a promise unsupported by consideration{{clarify|date=March 2018}} is being relied on by the other party.&lt;ref name="High Trees"&gt;''[[Central London Property Trust Ltd v High Trees House Ltd]]'' [1947] [[Kings Bench Law Reports|KB]] 130.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Legal doctrine]]s of estoppel are based in both [[common law]] and [[Equity (law)|equity]].&lt;ref&gt;See ''Jorden v Money''  [1854] 10 ER 868&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://swarb.co.uk/jorden-and-louisa-his-wife-v-money-hl-30-jul-1854/ ''Jorden v Money'']&lt;/ref&gt; 

It is also a concept in [[international law]].&lt;ref&gt;T. COTTIER, H. P. MÜLLER, "[http://opil.ouplaw.com/view/10.1093/law:epil/9780199231690/law-9780199231690-e1401 Estoppel]" in ''Max Planck encyclopedia of Public International Law'', april 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Types of estoppel==
There are many different types of estoppel which can arise, but the common thread between them is that a person is restrained from asserting a particular position in law where it would be inequitable to do so. By way of illustration:

* If a landlord promises the tenant that he will not exercise his right to terminate a lease, and relying upon that promise the tenant spends money improving the premises, the doctrine of ''[[promissory estoppel]]'' may prevent the landlord from exercising a right to terminate, even though his promise might not otherwise have been legally binding as a contract. The landlord is precluded from asserting a specific ''right''.
* If a person brings legal proceedings in one country claiming that a second person negligently injured them and the courts of that country determine that there was no negligence, then under the doctrine of ''[[issue estoppel]]'' the first person will not normally be able to argue before the courts of another country that the second person was negligent (whether in respect of the same claim or a related claim). The first person is precluded from asserting a specific ''claim''.

Estoppel is an equitable doctrine.&lt;ref name="Waltons HCA"&gt;{{Cite AustLII|HCA|7|1988|litigants=[[Waltons Stores (Interstate) Ltd v Maher]] |parallelcite=(1988) 164 [[Commonwealth Law Reports|CLR]] 387 |date=19 February 1988 |courtname=auto}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Accordingly, any person wishing to assert an estoppel must normally come to the court with "[[clean hands]]".

The doctrine of estoppel (which may prevent a party from asserting a right) is often confused with the doctrine of [[waiver]] (which relates to relinquishing a right once it has arisen). It also substantially overlaps with, but is distinct from, the equitable doctrine of [[Laches (equity)|laches]].

==Etymology and usage==
The verb is ''estop'', which comes from [[Middle English]] ''estoppen'', itself borrowed from [[Old French]] ''estop(p)er'', ''estouper'', presumably from [[Vulgar Latin]] *''stuppāre.'' 'to stop up with tow, caulk', from [[Latin]] ''stuppa'', 'broken flax', from [[Ancient Greek]] ''stuppe'', 'broken flax'.&lt;ref&gt;"estop" and "stop", in ''American Heritage Dictionary of the English Language'' (2004), Fourth Edition, Boston:  Houghton Mifflin.&lt;/ref&gt; The noun form ''estoppel'' is based on the [[Old French]] ''estoupail,'' 'stopper, bung', a derivative of ''estouper''.

Where a court finds that a party has done something warranting a form of estoppel, that party is said to be estopped from making certain related arguments or claiming certain related rights. The defendant is estopped from presenting the related defence, or the plaintiff is estopped from making the related argument against the defendant. [[Edward Coke|Lord Coke]] stated, "It is called an estoppel or conclusion, because a man's own act or acceptance stoppeth or closeth up his mouth to allege or plead the truth."&lt;ref&gt;2 Coke, Littleton 352a&lt;/ref&gt;

== Overview ==
Estoppel is sometimes said to be a rule of evidence&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://ceds.vu.edu.au/buslaw/centrallon.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-12-10 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120125082725/http://ceds.vu.edu.au/buslaw/centrallon.htm |archivedate=2012-01-25 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; whereby a person is barred from leading evidence of a fact that has already been settled or they are otherwise precluded from asserting, but that may be an oversimplification. Firstly, although some estoppels relate to preventing a party from asserting ''facts'', others relate to preventing a party from asserting a ''right'' or a ''claim''. Secondly, under the [[conflict of laws]] in common law jurisdictions, matters of evidence are usually treated as [[Procedure in conflict of laws|procedural matters]] for the law of the local court (the ''[[lex fori]]''), whereas it is generally accepted that an estoppel may affect substantive rights and are therefore matters to be determined by the proper law (or ''[[lex causae]]'') that governs the particular issue.&lt;ref&gt;[[Dicey Morris &amp; Collins]], 14th ed. (2006) at '''7-031''': "For the purposes of English domestic law, estoppel is sometimes said to be a rule of evidence.  Whether ... it should be regarded as a rule of substance or procedure ... may well vary with the type of estoppel under consideration."&lt;/ref&gt;

There are many different types of estoppel that can arise under common law legal systems. It has been judicially noted on more than one occasion that the link between them is often somewhat tenuous. ''Treitel on Contracts'' notes that "unconscionability...provides the link between them", but they nevertheless have "separate requirements and different terrains of application".&lt;ref&gt;''Treitel on Contracts'', 14th ed. (2015) at '''3-090'''.&lt;/ref&gt;  The courts have long abandoned an attempt to create a single general underlying rationale or principle:
{{Cquote|the attempt... to demonstrate that all estoppels... are now subsumed in the single and all-embracing estoppel by representation and that they are all governed by the same principle [has] never won general acceptance.&lt;br /&gt;{{align|right|-- [[Peter Millett, Baron Millett|Lord Millett]]&lt;ref&gt;''First National Bank plc v Thompson'' [1996] Ch 231 at 236&lt;/ref&gt;}}}}

The plea of estoppel is often closely connected with the plea of [[waiver]], the object of both being to ensure [[bona fide]]s in day-to-day transactions.&lt;ref name=Olga&gt;India -- ''Olga Tellis v. Bombay Municipal Corporation'' (1985.07.10) (Right to Life and Livelihood for Homeless)&lt;/ref&gt; It is also related to the doctrines of variation and election. It is applied in many areas of contract law, including insurance, banking, and employment. In [[English law]], the concept of [[legitimate expectation]] in the realm of [[administrative law]] and [[judicial review]] is estoppel's counterpart in [[public law]].

Promissory estoppel is often applied where there is an agreement without a consideration, or the consideration is future-based (as a promise). When applied in defense by a defendant it may be called a "shield", and where applied by a plaintiff it may be called a "sword".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=https://mq.academia.edu/EsterLioe/Papers/1141002/Promissory_Estoppel_Serves_as_a_Shield_and_a_Swords_Guarding_Unconscionable|title=Promissory Estoppel Serves as a Shield and a Swords Guarding Unconscionable|first=Ester|last=Lioe|date=|website=academia.edu|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120425121254/http://mq.academia.edu/EsterLioe/Papers/1141002/Promissory_Estoppel_Serves_as_a_Shield_and_a_Swords_Guarding_Unconscionable|archivedate=2012-04-25|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.australiancontractlaw.com/cases/walton.html|title=Australian Contract Law - Julie Clarke|author=|date=|website=www.australiancontractlaw.com|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140313074030/http://www.australiancontractlaw.com/cases/walton.html|archivedate=2014-03-13|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is most commonly used as a shield,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.coursework.info/University/Law/Contract_Law/Promissory_Estoppel_is_a_shield_not_a_sw_L845199.html|title=Promissory Estoppel is a shield not a sword - University Law - Marked by Teachers.com&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;|author=|date=|website=coursework.info|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120129021800/http://www.coursework.info/University/Law/Contract_Law/Promissory_Estoppel_is_a_shield_not_a_sw_L845199.html|archivedate=2012-01-29|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; with some commentators stating that it can only be used as a shield, although this varies with jurisdictions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://netk.net.au/Contract/07Estoppel.asp|title=Contract Law lecture - Estoppel - its origins and forms|author=|date=|website=netk.net.au}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Examples ===
Estoppel can be understood by considering examples such as the following:

#A city entered into a contract with another party. The contract stated that it had been reviewed by the city's counsel and that the contract was proper.  Estoppel applied to estop the city from claiming the contract was invalid.&lt;ref&gt;''Speckman v. City of Indianapolis'', 540 N.E.2d 1189, 1191 (Ind. 1989).&lt;/ref&gt;
#A [[creditor]] unofficially informs a [[debtor]] that the creditor forgives the [[debt]] between them. Even if such forgiveness is not formally documented, the creditor may be estopped from changing its mind and seeking to collect the debt, because that change would be unfair.
#A [[landlord]] informs a [[leasehold estate|tenant]] that rent has been reduced, for example, because there was construction or a lapse in utility services. If the tenant relies on this statement in choosing to remain in the premises, the landlord could be estopped from collecting the full rent.

=== Types ===
Some types of estoppel under English, Australian, and American laws are as follows:

==== In civil cases ====
*'''Reliance-based estoppels''': These involve one party relying on something the other party has done or said. The party who performed/spoke is the one who is estopped. This category is discussed [[#Reliance-based estoppels|below]].
*'''Estoppel by record''': This frequently arises as issue/cause of action estoppel or judicial estoppel where the orders or judgments made in previous legal proceedings prevent the parties from relitigating the same issues or causes of action.
*'''[[Estoppel by deed]]''': Situations where rules of [[Evidence (law)|evidence]] prevent a litigant from denying the truth of what was said or done.
*'''Estoppel by silence''' or [[acquiescence]]: Estoppel that prevents a person from asserting something when he had the right and opportunity to do so earlier, and such silence put another person at a disadvantage.
*'''[[Laches (equity)|Laches]]''': Estoppel after a litigant deliberately and avoidably delays an action so as to disadvantage an adversary.

=== In American criminal cases ===
*'''Entrapment by estoppel''': In American criminal law, although "[[ignorance of the law is no excuse]]" is a principle which generally holds for traditional (older [[common law]]) crimes, courts sometimes allow this [[excuse]] as a defense, when defendant can show they reasonably relied on an interpretation of the law by the public official(s) charged with enforcement or interpretation of that law, such as a regulatory official (even if that official's interpretation is later determined to be wrong).&lt;ref name=Twitchell&gt;[[Commonwealth v. Twitchell]], Supreme Judicial Court of Massachusetts, 416 Mass. 114, 617 N. E.2d (1993); Wilkins, Justice&lt;/ref&gt; The defense is based on "[[Equity (law)|fairness]]" principles in the [[Fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Fifth Amendment]].&lt;ref name=Twitchell/&gt; It generally involves [[determination of fact]], not of law,&lt;ref name=Twitchell/&gt; except as to determination of whether the interpreting government official had the legal status asserted by the defense.&lt;ref name=Twitchell/&gt;

== Reliance-based estoppels ==
Reliance-based estoppels (at English law) include:&lt;ref&gt;''Halsbury's Laws of England'', Vol 16(2), 2003&lt;/ref&gt;
*by representation of fact, where one person asserts the truth of a set of facts to another;
*promissory estoppel, where one person makes a promise to another, but there is no enforceable contract; and
*proprietary estoppel, where the parties are litigating the title to land.
Both ''Halsbury's'' and Spencer Bower (see below) describe these three estoppels collectively as '''estoppels by representation'''.  More simply, one party must say or do something and see the other party rely on what is said or done to change behavior.

All reliance-based estoppels require the victimised party to show both ''inducement'' and ''detrimental reliance'', i.e.:
* there must be evidence to show that the representor actually intended the victim to act on the representation or promise, '''or'''
* the victim must satisfy the court that it was reasonable for him or her to act on the relevant representation or promise, '''and'''
* what the victim did must either have been reasonable, '''or'''
* the victim did what the representor intended, '''and'''
* the victim would suffer a loss or ''detriment'' if the representor was allowed to deny what was said or done—detriment is measured at the time when the representor proposes to deny the representation or withdraw the promise, not at the time when either was made, '''and'''
* in all the circumstances, the behavior of the representor is such that it would be "unconscionable" to allow him or her to resile.

Simply put, promissory estoppel has four necessary elements which the plaintiff must prove:
* there was a promise
* that was reasonably relied upon
* resulting legal detriment to the promisee
* justice requires enforcement of the promise

Estoppel by representation of fact and promissory estoppel are mutually exclusive: the former is based on a representation of existing fact (or of mixed fact and law), while the latter is based on a promise not to enforce some pre-existing right (i.e. it expresses an intention as to the future). A promissory estoppel operates only between parties who, at the time of the representation, were in an existing relationship, while this is not a requirement for estoppel by representation of fact.

The test for '''[[unconscionability]]''' in the English and Australian courts takes many factors into account, including the behavior, state of mind and circumstances of the parties. Generally, the following eight factors are determinative:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Michael |last=Spence |title=Protecting Reliance: The Emergent Doctrine of Equitable Estoppel |publisher=Hart Publishing |year=1999 |pages=60–66 |ISBN=9781901362626}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*how the promise/representation and reliance upon it were induced;
*the content of the promise/representation;
*the relative knowledge of the parties;
*the parties' relative interest in the relevant activities in reliance;
*the nature and context of the parties' relationship;
*the parties' relative strength of position;
*the history of the parties' relationship; and
*the steps, if any, taken by the promisor/representor to ensure he has not caused preventable harm.

But in ''Cobbe v Yeoman's Row'',&lt;ref name=cobbe&gt;''Cobbe v Yeoman's Row'' [2008] UKHL 55&lt;/ref&gt; Lord Scott of Foscote stated the following:

{{quote|the ingredients for a proprietary estoppel should include, in principle, a proprietary claim made by a claimant and an answer to that claim based on some fact, or point of mixed fact and law, which the person against whom the claim was made could be estopped from asserting. To treat a "proprietary estoppel equity" as requiring simply unconscionable behaviour was a recipe for confusion. The remedy to which, on the facts as found by the judge, the claimant was entitled could be described neither as based on an estoppel nor as proprietary in character. His Lordship's present view was that proprietary estoppel could not be prayed in aid to render enforceable an agreement declared by statute (s.&amp;nbsp;2 of the Law Reform (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 1989) to be void. A claim for the imposition of a constructive trust to provide a remedy for a disappointed expectation engendered by a representation made in the course of incomplete contractual negotiations was misconceived and could not be sustained by reliance on unconscionable behaviour. The claimant was, however, entitled to a quantum meruit payment for his services in obtaining the planning permission.}}

=== England and Wales ===
==== Estoppel by representation of fact ====
In English law, '''estoppel by representation of fact''' is a term coined by Spencer Bower. This species of estoppel is also referred to as "common law estoppel by representation" in ''Halsbury's Laws of England'', vol 16(2), 2003 reissue.

Spencer Bower defines estoppel by representation of fact as follows:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The Law relating to Estoppel by Representation |edition=4th |first=Spencer |last=Bower |year=2004 |at=para. I.2.2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|Where one person ('the representor') has made a representation of fact to another person ('the representee') in words or by acts or conduct, or (being under a duty to the representee to speak or act) by silence or inaction, with the intention (actual or presumptive) and with the result of inducing the representee on the faith of such representation to alter his position to his detriment, the representor, in any litigation which may afterwards take place between him and the representee, is estopped, as against the representee, from making, or attempting to establish by evidence, any averment substantially at variance with his former representation, if the representee at the proper time, and in proper manner, objects thereto.}}

A second definition comes from Sean Wilken and Theresa Villiers:&lt;ref name=wilkenvilliers&gt;{{cite book  |title=The Law of Waiver, Variation and Estoppel |first1=Sean |last1=Wilken |first2=Theresa |last2=Villiers |edition=2nd |publisher=Oxford University Press |year=2002}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|para. 9.02}}

{{quote|An estoppel by representation [of fact] will arise between A and B if the following elements are made out. First, A makes a false representation of fact to B or to a group of which B was a member. [It is not necessary to demonstrate A knew that the representation was untrue.] Second, in making the representation, A intended or [in the alternatively,] knew that it was likely to be acted upon. Third, B, believing the representation, acts to its detriment in reliance on the representation. [It must have been reasonable to rely on the representation.] Fourth, A subsequently seeks to deny the truth of the representation. Fifth, no defence to the estoppel can be raised by A.}}

A representation can be made by words or conduct. Although the representation must be clear and unambiguous, a representation can be inferred from silence where there is a duty to speak or from negligence where a duty of care has arisen. Under English law, estoppel by representation of fact usually acts as a defence, though it may act in support of a cause of action or counterclaim.

==== Equitable estoppel ====
{{Main|Estoppel in English law}}
Under English and Australian legal systems, ''estoppels in [[Equity (law)|equity]]'' include promissory and proprietary estoppels, described below.  (Contrast with estoppel by representation, which is a claim (under the English system) at law.)

===== Proprietary estoppel =====
{{Main|Proprietary estoppel}}
In English law, ''proprietary estoppel'' is distinct from promissory estoppel.  ''Proprietary estoppel'' is not a concept in American law, but a similar result is often reached under the general doctrine of promissory estoppel.

Traditionally, ''proprietary estoppel'' arose in relation to rights to use the land of the owner, and possibly in connection with disputed transfers of ownership.  Although proprietary estoppel was only traditionally available in disputes affecting title to real property, it has now gained limited acceptance in other areas of law.  Proprietary estoppel is closely related to the doctrine of constructive trust.&lt;ref name=cobbe/&gt;

J. Fry summarized the five '''elements''' for proprietary estoppel as:&lt;ref&gt;''Wilmott v Barber'' (1880) 15 Ch D 96&lt;/ref&gt;

* the claimant
** made a mistake as to his legal rights (typically because the actual owner attempted to convey the property, but the transfer is invalid or ineffective for some reason);
** did some act of reliance;
* the defendant
** knows of the existence of a legal right which he (the defendant) possesses, and which is inconsistent with the right claimed by the claimant;
** knows of the claimant's mistaken belief; and
** encouraged the claimant in his act of reliance.

'''Example:''' A father promised a house to his son who took possession and spent a large sum of money improving the property, but the father never actually transferred the house to the son.  Upon the father's death, the son claimed to be the equitable owner. The court found the testamentary trustees (as representatives of the deceased father's estate) were ''estopped'' from denying the son's proprietary interest, and ordered them to convey the land to the son.&lt;ref&gt;''Dillwyn v Llewelyn'' (1862) 4 De G.F.&amp; J. 517 C.A. See also ''Inwards v Baker'' [1965] 2 Q.B. 29, C.A.&lt;/ref&gt;

===== Promissory estoppel =====
The [[doctrine]] of ''promissory estoppel'' prevents one party from withdrawing a promise made to a second party if the latter has reasonably relied on that promise.

A promise made without [[consideration]] is generally not enforceable. It is known as a bare or gratuitous promise. Thus, if a car salesman promises a potential buyer not to sell a certain car over the weekend, but does so, the promise cannot be enforced. But should the car salesman accept from the potential buyer even one penny in consideration for the promise, the promise will be enforceable in court by the potential buyer. Estoppel extends the court's purview even to cases where there is no consideration, though it is generally not a 'sword': not a basis on which to initiate a lawsuit.

The doctrine of ''promissory estoppel'' was first developed in ''[[Hughes v. Metropolitan Railway Co]]'' [1877] but was lost for some time until it was resurrected by [[Lord Denning|Denning J]] in the controversial case of ''[[Central London Property Trust Ltd v High Trees House Ltd]]''.&lt;ref name="High Trees"/&gt;

Promissory estoppel requires:
#an unequivocal promise by words or conduct
#evidence that there is a change in position of the promisee as a result of the promise (reliance but ''not necessarily to their detriment'')
#inequity if the promisor were to go back on the promise

In general, estoppel is "a shield not a sword"—it cannot be used as the basis of an action on its own.&lt;ref name="test"&gt;''Combe v Combe'' (1951) 2 [[Kings Bench Law Reports|KB]] 215&lt;/ref&gt; It also does not extinguish rights. In ''High Trees'' the plaintiff company was able to restore payment of full rent from early 1945, and could have restored the full rent at any time after the initial promise was made provided a suitable period of notice had been given. In this case, the estoppel was applied to a "negative promise", that is, one where a party promises not to enforce full rights.

Estoppel is an equitable (as opposed to common law) construct and its application is therefore discretionary. In the case of ''[[D &amp; C Builders v. Rees]]'' the courts refused to recognise a promise to accept a part payment of £300 on a debt of £482 on the basis that it was extracted by duress. In ''[[Combe v. Combe]]'' Denning elaborated on the equitable nature of estoppel by refusing to allow its use as a "sword" by an ex-wife to extract funds from the destitute husband.

The general rule is that when one party agrees to accept a lesser sum in full payment of a debt, the debtor has given no consideration, and so the creditor is still entitled to claim the debt in its entirety. This is not the case if the debtor offers payment at an earlier date than was previously agreed, because the benefit to the creditor of receiving payment early can be thought of as consideration for the promise to waive the rest of the debt. This is the rule formulated in ''[[Pinnel's Case]]'',&lt;ref&gt;''[[Pinnel's Case]]'' (1602) 5 Co Rep 117a&lt;/ref&gt; and affirmed in ''[[Foakes v Beer]]''.&lt;ref&gt;''[[Foakes v Beer]]'' (1884) 9 App Cas 605&lt;/ref&gt;

The decision of the Court of Appeal in ''Collier v P &amp; MJ Wright (Holdings) Ltd'' suggests that the doctrine of promissory estoppel can now operate to mitigate the harshness of this common law rule.&lt;ref&gt;''Collier v P &amp; MJ Wright (Holdings) Ltd'' 2008 1 WLR 643&lt;/ref&gt; Moreover, [[Arden LJ]] held that allowing a creditor to renege on his promise to forebear seeking the balance of a debt in return for part payment would be, in and of itself, inequitable. Therefore, the only reliance that the promisee must demonstrate is the actual making of the part payment. This approach has been criticised as doing violence to the principle set down in Hughes and the extent to which the other members of the Court, namely [[Longmore LJ]], agreed with it is uncertain.

=== United States ===
==== Equitable estoppel ====
Equitable estoppel is the American counterpart to estoppel by representation. Its elements are summarized as:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Lucian B. |last=Cox |title=Equity: Principles and procedures in Virginia and West Virginia |at=§ 288 |year=1951}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*Facts misrepresented or concealed
*Knowledge of true facts
*Fraudulent intent
*Inducement and reliance
*Injury to complainant
*Clear, concise, unequivocal proof of actus (not by implication)

For example, in ''Aspex Eyewear v. Clariti Eyewear'', eyeglass frame maker Aspex sued competitor Clariti for patent infringement.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cafc.uscourts.gov/opinions/09-1147.pdf|title=''Aspex Eyewear v.

During this period, Clariti expanded its marketing and sales of the products. The [[Federal Circuit]] found that Aspex misled Clariti to believe it would not enforce its patent, and thus estopped Aspex from proceeding with the suit.&lt;ref&gt;Joel Leeman, [http://sunsteinlaw.com/silence-is-deadly-the-peril-of-inaction-after-calling-someone-an-infringer/ "Silence is Deadly: The Peril of Inaction After Calling Someone an Infringer"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140714223656/http://sunsteinlaw.com/silence-is-deadly-the-peril-of-inaction-after-calling-someone-an-infringer/ |date=2014-07-14 }}, Sunstein IP Update (June 2010)&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Promissory estoppel ====
In many jurisdictions of the United States, ''promissory estoppel'' is an alternative to [[consideration]] as a basis for enforcing a promise. It is also sometimes called ''detrimental reliance.''

The [[American Law Institute]] in 1932 included the principle of estoppel into § 90 of the [[Restatement of Contracts]], stating:

{{quote|A promise which the promisor should reasonably expect to induce action or forbearance of a definite and substantial character on the part of the promisee and which does induce such action or forbearance is binding if injustice can be avoided only by enforcement of the promise.|Restatement (Second) removed the requirement that the detriment be "substantial".}}

However:

{{quote|Equitable estoppel is distinct from promissory estoppel. Promissory estoppel involves a clear and definite promise, while equitable estoppel involves only representations and inducements. The representations at issue in promissory estoppel go to future intent, while equitable estoppel involves statement of past or present fact. It is also said that equitable estoppel lies in tort, while promissory estoppel lies in contract. The major distinction between equitable estoppel and promissory estoppel is that the former is available only as a defense, while promissory estoppel can be used as the basis of a cause of action for damages.|28 Am Jur 2d Estoppel and Waiver § 34}}

Suppose that B goes to a store and sees a sign that the price of a radio is $10. B tells the shopkeeper that he will get the money and come back later that day to purchase it; there is no discussion of price. The shopkeeper says that when B returns, he will welcome B as a customer—unless he sells all three of his radios first. Hearing this, B goes and sells his watch for $10 (it was really worth $15, but since B wanted the money right away, he chose not to wait for the best price). When B returns, the sign says $11, and the owner tells B that he has raised the price. In equity, can you argue that the shopkeeper is estopped by conduct? B relied upon the implied representation that a radio would be sold for $10 when he returned with the money; B has sold his watch at a discount, to his detriment. (This element would be absent if B sold the watch at the market price.) But the shopkeeper did not guarantee to hold one of the radios against the possibility of B's return nor did they agree a fixed price.

In some common-law jurisdictions, a promise by the shopkeeper to hold a specific radio would create a binding contract, even if B had to go for the money. A ''promise'' to pay the owner in the future is good consideration if it is made in exchange for a promise to sell a specific radio (one from three is probably sufficiently specific): one promise in exchange for a second promise creates equal value. So the shopkeeper's actual words and knowledge are critical to deciding whether either a contract or an estoppel arises.

The drafters of the Second Restatement debated how to calculate the amount of damages flowing from a promissory estoppel, using the following example: A young man's uncle promises to give him $1,000 to buy a car. The young man buys a car for $500, but the uncle refuses to pay any money. Is the young man entitled to $1,000 (the amount promised), or merely $500 (the amount he actually lost)? The Restatement states that "The remedy granted for breach may be limited as justice requires."—leaving quantification to the discretion of the court. In practice, however, a recent study of over 300 promissory estoppel cases decided under the Restatement (Second) of Contracts has found that many courts continue to enforce the promise to the full extent (i.e., $1,000 in the example above).&lt;ref&gt;[https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=1373861&amp;download=yes "The Many Faces of Promissory Estoppel: An Empirical Analysis under the Restatement (Second) of Contracts"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170325025745/https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=1373861&amp;download=yes |date=2017-03-25 }}, by Marco Jimenez&lt;/ref&gt;

== Other estoppels ==

=== Pais ===
''Estoppel in pais'' (literally "by act of notoriety", or "solemn formal act") is the historical root of common law estoppel by representation and equitable estoppel. The terms ''Estoppel in pais'' and equitable estoppel are used interchangeably in American law.

=== Convention ===
''Estoppel by convention'' in English law (also known as ''estoppel by agreement'') occurs where two parties negotiate or operate a contract but make a [[Mistake (contract law)|mistake]]. If they share an assumption, belief, or understanding of the contract's interpretation or legal effect, then they are bound by it, if:{{Citation needed|date=September 2009}}

#They both knew the other had the same belief, and
#They both based their subsequent dealings on those beliefs.

Estoppel by convention is most commonly invoked if one party wishes to rely on pre-contract negotiation as an aid to construction of the contract.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite BAILII|litigants=Chartbrook Ltd and another v Persimmon Homes Ltd and another |court=UKHL |division= |year=2009 |num=38 |date= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is debatable whether ''estoppel by convention'' is a separate estoppel doctrine, or merely a case of ''reliance-based estoppel'' (''estoppel by representation'' would be its most frequent form), or of the rule of interpretation that, where words in a contract are ambiguous, one always interprets those words so as to give effect to the actual intentions of the parties even if that would not be the usual legal outcome (see ''Amalgamated Investment and Property Co. Ltd. v Texas Commerce International Bank Ltd'' [1982] QB 84).

=== Acquiescence ===
{{Main|Estoppel by acquiescence}}

''Estoppel by [[acquiescence]]'' may arise when one person gives a legal warning to another based on some clearly asserted facts or legal principle, and the other does not respond within "a reasonable period of time". By ''acquiescing'', the other person is generally considered to have lost the legal right to assert the contrary.

As an example, suppose that Jill has been storing her car on Jack's land with no contract between them. Jack sends a registered letter to Jill's legal address, stating: "I am no longer willing to allow your car to stay here for free. Please come get your car, or make arrangements to pay me rent for storing it. If you do not do so, within 30 days, I will consider the car abandoned and will claim ownership of it. If you need more time to make arrangements, please contact me within 30 days, and we can work something out." If Jill does not respond, she may be said to have ''relinquished'' her ownership of the car, and ''estoppel by acquiescence'' may prevent any court from invalidating Jack's actions of registering the car in his name and using it as his own.

=== Contractual ===

The law relating to contractual estoppel (in English law) was summarised in {{cite BAILII|litigants=Peekay Intermark Ltd v Australia and New Zealand Banking Group Ltd |court=EWCA |division=Civ |year=2006 |num=386 |date= }}:

{{cquote|There is no reason in principle why parties to a contract should not agree that a certain state of affairs should form the basis for the transaction, whether it be the case or not. For example, it may be desirable to settle a disagreement as to an existing state of affairs in order to establish a clear basis for the contract itself and its subsequent performance. Where parties express an agreement of that kind in a contractual document neither can subsequently deny the existence of the facts and matters upon which they have agreed, at least so far as concerns those aspects of their relationship to which the agreement was directed. The contract itself gives rise to an estoppel ...&lt;ref&gt;''Peekay Intermark Ltd v Australia and New Zealand Banking Group Ltd'', at paragraph 56.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

=== Deed ===
{{Main|Estoppel by deed}}

''Estoppel by deed'' is a rule of evidence arising from the status of a [[deed|contract signed under seal]]—such agreements, called deeds, are more strictly enforced than ordinary contracts and the parties are expected to take greater care to verify the contents before signing them. Hence, once signed, all statements of fact (usually found in the opening recital which sets out the reason(s) for making the deed) are conclusive evidence against the parties who are estopped from asserting otherwise.

=== Conflict estoppel ===
"[O]ne who by his speech or conduct has induced another to act in a particular manner ought not be permitted to adopt an inconsistent position, attitude or course of conduct may not be adopted to loss or injury of another".&lt;ref&gt;''Brand v. Farmer's Mut. Protective Assoc of Texas'', Tex. App 95 S.W.2d 994, 997&lt;/ref&gt; For example, as between two or more claimants, a party that takes multiple and inconsistent legal positions is estopped to assert its positions against another consistent and certain claim, i.e. preferential treatment for certain over uncertain claims.

===Issue estoppel===&lt;!--"issue estoppel" redirects here--&gt;
{{See also|Res judicata}}
Issue estoppel (more commonly known as issue preclusion) prevents, in some cases, an issue that has already been litigated and decided on the merits from being re-litigated, even when the parties are different.  In the world of crime, some cases have achieved notoriety, e.g. in the [[Birmingham Six]] saga, the [[Judicial Committee of the House of Lords|House of Lords]] ruled in ''Hunter v Chief Constable of the West Midlands Police (1982)'' that ''issue estoppel'' applied. [[Kenneth Diplock, Baron Diplock|Lord Diplock]] said:

{{quote|[This case] concerns the inherent power which any court of justice must possess to prevent misuse of its procedure in a way which, although not inconsistent with the literal application of its procedural rules, would nevertheless be manifestly unfair to a party to litigation before it, or would otherwise bring the administration of justice into disrepute among right-thinking people.&lt;ref&gt;[https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld200405/ldjudgmt/jd050210/polan-3.htm Judgments - Polanski (Appellant) v Conde Nast Publications Limited (Respondents)] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170708134446/https://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld200405/ldjudgmt/jd050210/polan-3.htm |date=2017-07-08 }} UK Parliament publications &gt; Business &gt; Lords Publications &gt; Judgment Index &gt; Judgment. Paragraph 86&lt;/ref&gt;}}

A variant of issue estoppel also precludes a party from bringing a claim in subsequent proceedings which ought properly to have been brought as part of earlier legal proceedings.&lt;ref&gt;''[[Henderson v Henderson]]'' (1843) 3 Hare 100, 67 ER 313.&lt;/ref&gt;

==In other countries==

=== Australia ===
The doctrine of promissory estoppel was adopted into [[Australia]]n law in ''[[Legione v Hateley]]''. However, the plaintiffs were unsuccessful in that case because the reliance was unreasonable and the promise not unequivocal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite AustLII|HCA|11|1983|litigants=[[Legione v Hateley]] |parallelcite=(1983) 152 [[Commonwealth Law Reports|CLR]] 406 at p 440  |date=14 April 1983 |courtname=auto}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Australian law has now gone beyond the position espoused in the English ''High Trees'' case,&lt;ref name="High Trees"/&gt; to cases where there is no pre-existing legal relationship between the two parties, and promissory estoppel can be wielded as a "sword", not just as a "shield". Mason CJ and Wilson J in ''[[Waltons Stores (Interstate) Ltd v Maher]]''&lt;ref name="Waltons HCA"/&gt; held that if estoppel is proven, it gives rise to an equity in favour of the plaintiff, and the court will do the minimum equity that is just in the circumstances. From this case, it is also possible for the promise to come from silence or inaction.

Stated by Brennan J in ''Waltons Stores'': {{quote|To establish an equitable estoppel, it is necessary for the plaintiff to prove that 1) the plaintiff assumed that a particular legal relationship would exist between them (and in the latter case) that the defendant would not be free to withdraw from that expected legal relationship; 2) the defendant has induced the plaintiff to adopt that assumption or expectation; 3) the plaintiff acts or abstains from acting in reliance on the assumption or expectation; 4) the defendant knew or intended him to do so; 5) the plaintiff's action or inaction will occasion detriment if the assumption of expectation is not fulfilled; and 6) the defendant has failed to act to avoid that detriment whether by fulfilling the assumption or expectation of otherwise.&lt;ref name="Waltons HCA"/&gt;}}

Although there is some debate as to whether "unconscionability" is an element that English courts need to take into account when considering estoppel by representation of fact, the Australian courts clearly do.&lt;ref name=wilkenvilliers/&gt;{{rp|para. 9-03}}&lt;ref name="Cth v Verwayen"&gt;{{cite AustLII|HCA|39|1990|litigants=[[Commonwealth v Verwayen]] |parallelcite=(1990) 170 [[Commonwealth Law Reports|CLR]] 394 at p 444 per Deane J |courtname=auto}}.&lt;/ref&gt;  This element is satisfied if one party encourages the other party to create assumptions that lead to reliance.&lt;ref name="Thompson v Palmer"&gt;{{cite AustLII|HCA|61|1933|litigants=Thompson v Palmer |parallecite=(1933) 49 [[COmmonwealth Law Reports|CLR]] 507 |date=14 December 1933 |courtname=auto}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Today, the principle of estoppel may give birth to an enforceable obligation even without a consideration under the following conditions:
# promise&lt;ref&gt;{{cite AustLII|NSWSC|43|1996|litigants=W v G |courtname=auto}}.&lt;/ref&gt;
# dishonest behaviour of the promisor
# special relationship between the promisor and the promisee,&lt;ref name="Con-stan Industries v Norwich"&gt;{{cite AustLII|HCA|14|1986|litigants=[[Con-stan Industries of Australia Pty Ltd v Norwich Winterthur Insurance (Australia) Ltd]] |parallelcite=(1986) 160 [[Commonwealth Law Reports|CLR]] 226 |courtname=auto |date=11 April 1986}}.&lt;/ref&gt; (e.g., duty of information);
# irreversible change of position on the part of the promisee

When enforcing an estoppel, Australian courts will look to the impact that enforcement will have on others, especially third parties. Relief in estoppel thus remains discretionary, and will not always be granted based on the expectation of the plaintiff.&lt;ref name="Giumelli v Giumelli"&gt;{{cite AustLII|HCA|10|1999|litigants=Giumelli v Giumelli |parallecite=(1999) 196 [[Commonwealth Law Reports|CLR]] 101}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite AustLII|NSWCA|84|2010|litigants=Delaforce v Simpson-Cook |date=20 July 2010 |courtname=auto}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

The status of estoppel by representation of fact is less clear in Australia. Two seminal decisions purport to fuse common law and equitable estoppels into a single unified doctrine,&lt;ref name="Waltons HCA"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Cth v Verwayen"/&gt; but the New South Wales Court of Appeal&lt;ref&gt;{{cite AustLII|NSWCA|158|2002|litigants=Byron Shire Council v Vaughan |courtname=auto}}.&lt;/ref&gt; continues to treat estoppel by representation at common law as distinct from equitable estoppel.&lt;ref&gt;Meagher, Gummow &amp; Lehane, ''Equity: Doctrines &amp; Remedies'', 4th edition, Butterworth: 2002, Chapter 17; and Parkinson, ''The Principles of Equity'', 2nd edition, LBC: 2003, Chapter 7.&lt;/ref&gt;  This can be significant in deciding which court has jurisdiction to adjudicate on the issue.

Whilst there also exists a doctrine of proprietary estoppel, the High Court of Australia merged this doctrine with the doctrine of promissory estoppel by virtue of their similar criteria.&lt;ref name="Waltons HCA"/&gt;

Nonetheless, authority for the doctrine of proprietary estoppel indicates that if a landlord allows a licensee to expend money on the land under an expectation created or encouraged by the landlord that he/she will be able to remain there, and the licensee suffers a detriment in relying on that expectation, an equity arises in the licensee such as to entitle him/her to stay.&lt;ref&gt;for expectation interest/assumption, see also {{cite AustLII|FCA|205|1998|litigants=Mobil Oil Australia Ltd v Wellcome International Pty Ltd |date=13 March 1998 |courtname=auto}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Inwards v Baker'' (1965) 2 [[Queens Bench Law Reports|QB]] 29.&lt;/ref&gt; Where a proprietary estoppel is found to exist, the court does not have to grant the plaintiff a proprietary interest in the land subject to the dispute. It may instead make an order that the plaintiff receive equitable compensation.&lt;ref name="Giumelli v Giumelli"/&gt;

=== India ===
Section 115 of the [[Indian Evidence Act]] defines estoppel: "When one person has, by his declaration, act or omission, intentionally caused or permitted another person to believe a thing to be true and to act upon such belief, neither he nor his representative shall be allowed, in any suit or proceeding between himself and such person or his representative, to deny the truth of that thing."

So, for instance, if A intentionally and falsely leads B to believe that certain land belongs to A, and thereby induces B to buy and pay for it, and only later does A acquire the land, then A is not allowed to argue to void the sale on the ground that, at the time of the sale, he had no title.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://indiankanoon.org/doc/565781/|title=Section 115 in The Indian Evidence Act, 1872|author=|date=|website=indiankanoon.org|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120813041454/http://www.indiankanoon.org/doc/565781/|archivedate=2012-08-13|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The doctrine of estoppel is based on the principle that consistency in word and action imparts certainty and honesty to human affairs. If a person makes a representation to another, on the faith of which the latter acts, to his prejudice, the former cannot recant the representation.

However, estoppel has no application to representations made regarding the fundamental rights conferred by the [[Constitution of India]], the source of all laws, which exists not only to benefit individuals but to secure collective rights. Thus, no one can barter away the freedoms conferred upon him by the Constitution. A concession made by him in a proceeding, whether under a [[mistake of law]] or otherwise, that he does not possess or will not enforce any particular fundamental right, cannot estop him, as enforcing estoppel would defeat the purpose of the Constitution.&lt;ref name=Olga/&gt;

'''FIN 48''' (mostly codified at ASC 740-10) is an official interpretation of United States accounting rules that requires businesses to analyze and disclose income tax risks. It was effective in 2007 for publicly traded entities, and is now effective for all entities adhering to [[US GAAP]]. A business may recognize an income tax benefit only if it is more likely than not that the benefit will be sustained. The amount of benefit recognized is based on relative probable outcomes.

==Background and concept==
Income for financial statements may differ from [[taxable income]] for many valid reasons.  U.S. [[Generally Accepted Accounting Principles]] have long required that [[income tax]] be accrued for all events recognized for financial reporting purposes.&lt;ref&gt;APB 11, released in 1967, was later superseded by [ SFAS 109] which is now codified as [http://asc.fasb.org/topic&amp;trid=2144680&amp;nav_type=left_nav&amp;analyticsAssetName=subtopic_page_left_nav_topic AC 740].&lt;/ref&gt;  The tax must be accrued if the liability is probable of assertion and can be determined with reasonable accuracy.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fasb.org/cs/BlobServer?blobcol=urldata&amp;blobtable=MungoBlobs&amp;blobkey=id&amp;blobwhere=1175820910926&amp;blobheader=application%2Fpdf SFAS 5], 1975, now incorporating fair value concepts at [http://asc.fasb.org/subtopic&amp;trid=2127163%26analyticsAssetName=section_page_subtopic%26nav_type=section_page AC 450-20].&lt;/ref&gt;  The tax must be recognized on all worldwide income of the business that may eventually be taxed.  Credits expected to be claimed may reduce this tax.  Certain limited exceptions apply. Thus, the total income tax of a U.S. company is generally the U.S. Federal income tax rate times book income, plus state and foreign taxes, less credits to be claimed presently or in the future. This tax expense is recorded as a combination of taxes currently payable and [[deferred tax]] assets and liabilities.

In 2006, the [[Financial Accounting Standards Board]] issued [http://www.fasb.org/cs/BlobServer?blobcol=urldata&amp;blobtable=MungoBlobs&amp;blobkey=id&amp;blobwhere=1175820931560&amp;blobheader=application%2Fpdf FASB Interpretation No. 48] on the above rules. Under FIN 48, businesses must analyze all tax positions that are less than certain. Only those positions that are more likely than not to produce benefit can be recognized in accruing tax. This is known as the recognition step. The likely outcomes of recognized positions are then computed and assigned probabilities. The most favorable set of outcomes that achieves 50% probability is then recognized. This is known as the measurement step. The business must then record tax expense or benefit, liabilities, and assets, as so measured.

Tax positions requiring analysis include all aspects of tax returns, including whether tax returns are filed in a jurisdiction. Further, businesses must accrue and disclose the effect of interest and penalties as part of the FIN 48 analysis.

==Recognition==
Income tax expense, just as any other expense, must be generally [http://asc.fasb.org/section&amp;nav_type=topic_page%26analyticsAssetName=topic_page_subsection%26trid=2144693#topic-740-10-25-subsect-01-109314 recognized] when income is earned. Credits or other items that reduce this tax are recognized only if it is more likely than not that the reductions will be sustained by tax authorities.  FIN 48 clarifies several aspects of this process:
*Analysis is at the "unit of account" rather than in aggregate
*The "more likely than not" standard applies at this level
*It is presumed that all positions will be examined, and tax authorities will have full knowledge of all relevant information
*Whether a position can be sustained is based solely on the technical merits of the position

The level of detail of the analysis (unit of account) depends on how the business keeps its records, presents its financial statements, and deals with tax authorities. This may vary from business to business, and may change over time. Further, materiality is determined at the unit of account level.

One key clarification is the presumption of examination of all positions by knowledgeable tax authorities and a resolution of disputes over those positions solely on the technical merits of each position. All relevant tax law is to be considered for the individual position. Positions that are not technically correct are allowed only where there is widely understood administrative practice allowing the position.&lt;ref&gt;One example of such position is expensing rather than capitalizing and depreciating small assets.  See AC 740-10-25-7b.&lt;/ref&gt;  Thus, for example, a position would not be acceptable merely because an [[Internal Revenue Service]] agent allowed it in a previous year.

==Measurement==
If it is more likely than not that a position will be sustained, then the effect of the position must be measured.  Measurement is a three-step process:
*Determine possible outcomes of each position,
*Determine the likelihood of such outcome, and
*Determine the outcome that is most favorable with a cumulative likelihood of more than 50%.

For example, assume a position exists which is more likely than not to be sustained at least in part.  Management determines that it is 25% likely that $100 of benefit will be sustained, and 30% likely that $75 of benefit will be sustained.  The business must accrue only $75 of benefit.

Positions that are highly certain of full recognition may require very limited analysis.

==Disclosure==
In addition to accruing the tax, FIN 48 requires disclosures in footnotes to the financial statements.  Year end statements must include:
*A tabular reconciliation of unrecognized tax benefits,
*The total amount of unrecognized tax benefits that, if recognized, would affect the effective tax rate,
*Total interest and penalties recognized in the analysis,
*Unrecognized tax benefits that may significantly change within 12 months of the financial statements, and
*A description of tax years that remain subject to examination, by major applicable tax jurisdiction.

==Impact on Acquisitions and Dispositions of Businesses==
Parties involved in disposition of a business to US publicly traded companies need to take into account the potential that FIN 48 disclosures might alert relevant tax authorities to aggressive tax positions taken by the business.  This may be of particular concern in countries such as Brazil with complex tax legislation.  .&lt;ref&gt;
[Kapur, Sanjiv K., Revista Comercialista, November 2013 "FIN 48 is no Fun for Brazilian Companies with Uncertain Tax Positions" http://issuu.com/revistacomercialista/docs/comercialista_v.9_-_m_a#!]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Flat Rock Assembly Plant''', formerly known as Ford's Michigan Casting Center (MCC) (1972–81), Mazda Motor Manufacturing USA (1987–92) and '''AutoAlliance International''' (1992–2012), is a [[Ford Motor Company]] assembly plant located at {{nowrap|1 International}} Drive in [[Flat Rock, Michigan]] in [[Metro Detroit]]. 

The plant currently comprises {{convert|2900000|sqft|m2}} of production space and employs 3,510 hourly workers and 140 salaried workers &amp;mdash; and currently manufactures the [[Ford Mustang]] coupe and the tenth generation [[Lincoln Continental#Tenth generation (2017–present)|Lincoln Continental]].

==History==
[[File:FORD MOTOR COMPANY'S NEW CASTING PLANT AT FLAT ROCK - NARA - 549726.jpg|thumb|right|Casting plant, 1973.]]
Following three years of work and the largest single investment by Ford, the Michigan Casting Center (MCC) opened in January 1972, at the time one of the most technologically advanced casting facilities in the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Ford Opens a Giant Casting Centre|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=6GwtAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=4YkFAAAAIBAJ&amp;dq=michigan%20casting%20center%20opened&amp;pg=2695%2C4464032|work=Schenectady Gazette|accessdate=11 April 2013|date=20 January 1972}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Despite the sizable capital investment, frequent union labor problems and work injuries&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Detroit plant|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=jTQ_AAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=d1EMAAAAIBAJ&amp;dq=michigan%20casting%20center%20opened&amp;pg=1110%2C375353|work=Windsor Star|accessdate=11 April 2013|date=1 November 1973}}&lt;/ref&gt;  and declining demand for the V8 engine blocks produced there led to the facility's closure in 1981.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Ford Will Close Unit in Flat Rock|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1981/09/15/business/ford-will-close-unit-in-flat-rock.html|work=New York Times|accessdate=11 April 2013|date=15 September 1981}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Flat Rock Mayor Hopeful|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=IFwiAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=AasFAAAAIBAJ&amp;dq=michigan%20casting%20center%20closed&amp;pg=1337%2C2901659|work=The Argus-Press|accessdate=11 April 2013|date=3 December 1984}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A worker, [[Robert Williams (robot fatality)|Robert Williams]], was killed by an [[industrial robot]] arm on January 25, 1979. He is the first known human to be killed by a robot.

[[Mazda|Mazda Motor Corporation]] started construction of a new building on the site of the Michigan Casting Center in 1985 and cars started production at Mazda Motor Manufacturing USA in September 1987 with the [[Mazda MX-6]] and [[Ford Probe]] coupes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Manji|first=James F.|title=Building cars with Mazda quality.

Ford repurchased a 50% share in the plant on April 15, 1992, and it officially became a joint-venture and was renamed AutoAlliance International on July 1, 1992.&lt;ref name=Mazda2008&gt;{{cite web|title=North American All-New Mazda6 Production Begins at AutoAlliance International|url=http://www.mazda.com/publicity/release/2008/200807/080723.html|work=Mazda|accessdate=11 April 2013|date=23 July 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;   The plant began production of all models of the [[Mazda 626]] sold in America starting in 1993.  During this era, [[Deepak Ahuja]] was Chief Financial Officer of the joint venture.&lt;ref name="star-20111111"&gt;{{cite magazine|url=https://www.mccormick.northwestern.edu/magazine/fall-2011/PDF/alumni-profile-deepak-ahuja.pdf|title=Alumni profile: Deepak Ahuja|work=McCormick Magazine|issue=Fall 2011|page=42|date=11 November 2011|accessdate=18 September 2018|first=Leanne|last=Star}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Ford Contour]]-derived [[Mercury Cougar]] was produced at the plant from 1998 to 2002. Production of North American [[Mazda 6]] began in the 2003 model year, followed by the [[Ford Mustang]] starting in 2005.

The last Mazda 6 rolled off the line on Friday, August 24, 2012, with Mazda discontinuing production on American soil, effectively ending the 20 year joint-venture between Mazda and Ford. Mazda moved production of the Mazda 6 back to the [[Hofu (Mazda factory)|Hofu factory]] in Japan and opened a new factory in Salamanca, Mexico to build the [[Mazda 2]] and [[Mazda 3]] subcompact and compact cars.

On September 10, 2012, Ford Motor Company re-took full management control of the plant, renaming it the Ford Flat Rock Assembly Plant, and confirming $555 million in investments designed to retool the plant for the production of the 2013 [[Ford Fusion (Americas)|Ford Fusion]] midsize sedan.&lt;ref name="media.ford.com"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://media.ford.com/article_display.cfm?article_id=37067 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2012-11-25 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121112164832/http://media.ford.com/article_display.cfm?article_id=37067 |archivedate=2012-11-12 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On July 15, 2015, Ford confirmed that the new 2017 [[Lincoln Continental]] sedan would be produced at the Flat Rock plant starting in 2016.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Lincoln Continental to be made at Ford Flat Rock plant|url=http://www.freep.com/story/money/cars/ford/2015/07/15/ford-confirms-lincoln-continental-production-flat-rock-michigan-plant/30197835|date=15 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On January 3, 2017, Ford announced that it will begin manufacturing an electric small SUV by 2020, and a high passenger volume autonomous vehicle designed for commercial ride hailing or ride sharing by 2021, both to be built at Flat Rock.&lt;ref&gt;https://media.ford.com/content/fordmedia/fna/us/en/news/2017/01/03/ford-adding-electrified-f-150-mustang-transit-by-2020.html&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Franchising''' is based on a marketing concept which can be adopted by an organization as a strategy for business expansion. Where implemented, a franchiser licenses its know-how, procedures, intellectual property, use of its [[business model]], brand, and rights to sell its branded products and services to a franchisee. In return the franchisee pays certain fees and agrees to comply with certain obligations, typically set out in a Franchise Agreement.

The word "franchise" is of Anglo-French derivation—from ''franc'', meaning free—and is used both as a noun and as a (transitive) verb.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=franchise&amp;allowed_in_frame=0 "franchise"] ''Online Etymology Dictionary''&lt;/ref&gt;
For the franchiser, use of a franchise system is an alternative business growth strategy, compared to expansion through corporate owned outlets or "[[chain store]]s". Adopting a franchise system business growth strategy for the sale and distribution of goods and services minimizes the franchiser's capital investment and liability risk.

As with any business venture, franchising is not immune to risk. But if undertaken in the right way, franchising can be a vehicle of success for both the franchisor and franchisee.

Thirty-three countries have laws that explicitly regulate franchising, with the majority of all other countries having laws which have a direct or indirect effect on franchising.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dlapiper.com/us/services/detail.aspx?service=256|title=International Franchise and Distribution|accessdate=2012-02-02|year=2012|work=DLA Piper|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120402043832/http://www.dlapiper.com/us/services/detail.aspx?service=256|archivedate=2012-04-02|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Franchising is also used as a [[foreign market entry modes|foreign market entry mode]].

==History==
The boom in franchising did not take place until after [[World War II]]. Nevertheless, the rudiments of modern franchising date back to the [[Middle Ages]] when landowners made franchise-like agreements with tax collectors, who retained a percentage of the money they collected and turned the rest over.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.franchoice.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/History-of-Franchising.pdf|title=History of Franchising|last=|first=|date=|website=Franchoice.com|access-date=30 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The practice ended around 1562 but spread to other endeavors.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.franchise-chat.com/resources/where_it_all_began_the_evolution_of_franchising.htm|title=Where it all began.  The evolution of franchising. {{!}} Franchise-chat Resource Archive|website=Franchise-chat.com|access-date=2017-06-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, in 17th century England franchisees were granted the right to sponsor markets and fairs or operate ferries. There was little growth in franchising, though, until the mid-19th century, when it appeared in the United States for the first time.

One of the first successful American franchising operations was started by an enterprising druggist named [[John Pemberton|John S. Pemberton]]. In 1886, he concocted a beverage comprising sugar, molasses, spices, and cocaine. Pemberton licensed selected people to bottle and sell the drink, which was an early version of what is now known as Coca-Cola. His was one of the earliest—and most successful—franchising operations in the United States.

The [[Singer Corporation|Singer Company]] implemented a franchising plan in the 1850s to distribute its sewing machines. The operation failed, though, because the company did not earn much money even though the machines sold well. The dealers, who had exclusive rights to their territories, absorbed most of the profits because of deep discounts. Some failed to push Singer products, so competitors were able to outsell the company. Under the existing contract, Singer could neither withdraw rights granted to franchisees nor send in its own salaried representatives. So, the company started repurchasing the rights it had sold. The experiment proved to be a failure. That may have been one of the first times a franchisor failed, but it was by no means the last. (Even Colonel Sanders did not initially succeed in his [[Kentucky Fried Chicken]] franchising efforts.) Still, the Singer venture did not put an end to franchising.

Other companies tried franchising in one form or another after the Singer experience. For example, several decades later, [[General Motors Corporation]] established a somewhat successful franchising operation in order to raise capital. Perhaps the father of modern franchising, though, is [[Louis K. Liggett]]. In 1902, Liggett invited a group of druggists to join a "drug cooperative." As he explained to them, they could increase profits by paying less for their purchases, especially if they set up their own manufacturing company. His idea was to market private label products. About 40 druggists pooled $4,000 of their own money and adopted the name "[[Rexall]]". Sales soared, and Rexall became a franchisor. The chain's success set a pattern for other franchisors to follow.

Although many business owners did affiliate with cooperative ventures of one type or another, there was little growth in franchising until the early 20th century, and what franchising there was did not take the same form as it does today. As the United States shifted from an agricultural to an industrial economy, manufacturers licensed individuals to sell automobiles, trucks, gasoline, beverages, and a variety of other products. The franchisees did little more than sell the products, though. The sharing of responsibility associated with contemporary franchising arrangement did not exist to any great extent. Consequently, franchising was not a growth industry in the United States.

It was not until the 1960s and 1970s that people began to take a close look at the attractiveness of franchising. The concept intrigued people with entrepreneurial spirit. However, there were serious pitfalls for investors, which almost ended the practice before it became truly popular.

Mid-sized franchises like restaurants, gasoline stations and trucking stations involve substantial investment and require all the attention of a businessperson.

There are also large franchises like hotels, spas and hospitals, which are discussed further under [[technological alliance]]s.

==Fees and contract arrangement==
Three important payments are made to a franchisor: (a) a [[royalties|royalty]] for the trademark, (b) reimbursement for the training and advisory services given to the franchisee, and (c) a percentage of the individual business unit's sales. These three fees may be combined in a single 'management' fee. A fee for "disclosure" is separate and is always a "front-end fee".

A franchise usually lasts for a fixed time period (broken down into shorter periods, which each require renewal), and serves a specific territory or geographical area surrounding its location. One franchisee may manage several such locations. Agreements typically last from five to thirty years, with premature cancellations or terminations of most contracts bearing serious consequences for franchisees. A franchise is merely a temporary business investment involving renting or leasing an opportunity, not the purchase of a business for the purpose of ownership. It is classified as a wasting asset due to the finite term of the license.

Franchise fees are on average 6.7% with an additional average marketing fee of 2% &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.franchise.org/industrysecondary.aspx?id=31612|title=The Profile of Franchising Report Series III – Royalty and Advertising Fees|year=2006|work=International Franchise Association}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, not all franchise opportunities are the same and many franchise organizations are pioneering new models that challenge antiquated structures and redefine success for the organization as well as the franchisee.

A franchise can be exclusive, non-exclusive or "sole and exclusive".

Although franchisor revenues and profit may be listed in a [[Franchise Disclosure Document|franchise disclosure document]] (FDD), no laws require an estimate of franchisee profitability, which depends on how intensively the franchisee "works" the franchise. Therefore, franchisor fees are typically based on "gross revenue from sales" and not on profits realized. See [[remuneration]].

Various tangibles and intangibles such as national or international [[advertising]], [[training]] and other support services are commonly made available by the franchisor.

Franchise brokers help franchisors find appropriate franchisees.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Libava|first1=Joel|title=What is a Franchise Broker|url=https://www.sba.gov/blogs/what-franchise-broker|website=Small Business Administration|accessdate=22 July 2017|date=5 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are also main 'master franchisors' who obtain the rights to sub-franchise in a territory.

According to the International Franchise Association approximately 44% of all businesses in the United States are franchisee-worked.

==Rationale and risk shift==
Franchising is one of the few means available to access [[venture capital]] without the need to give up control of the operation of the chain and build a distribution system for servicing it. After the brand and formula are carefully designed and properly executed, franchisors are able to sell franchises and expand rapidly across countries and continents using the capital and resources of their franchisees while reducing their own risk.

There is also risk for the people buying the franchises. However, failure rates are much lower for franchise businesses than independent business startups.&lt;ref name="TimothyNoah"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Noah|first1=Timothy|title=Disenfranchised: Why are Americans Still Buying Into the Franchise Dream|url=https://psmag.com/economics/disenfranchised-fast-food-workers-quiznos-73967|website=Pacific Standard|publisher=The Social Justice Foundation|accessdate=22 July 2017|date=4 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Franchisor rules imposed by the franchising authority are becoming increasingly strict. Some franchisors are using minor rule violations to terminate contracts and seize the franchise without any reimbursement.&lt;ref name="TimothyNoah" /&gt;

== Advantages and disadvantages of franchising as an entry mode ==
Franchising brings with it several advantages and disadvantages for firms looking to expand into new areas and foreign markets. The primary advantage is that the firm does not have to bear the development cost and risks of opening a foreign market on its own, as the Franchisee is typically responsible for those costs and risks, putting the onus on the Franchisee to build a profitable operation as quickly as possible.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title=International Business|last=Hill|first=Charles W.L.|publisher=McGraw-Hill Education|year=2015|isbn=978-0-07-811277-5|location=New York|pages=457}}&lt;/ref&gt; Through franchising a firm has the potential of building a global presence quickly and also at a low cost and risk.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

A primary disadvantage to franchising is quality control, as the franchisor wants the firm's brand name to convey a message to consumers about the quality and consistency of the firm's product.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; They want the consumer to experience the same quality regardless of location or franchise status.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; This can prove to be an issue with franchising, as a customer who had a bad experience at one franchise may assume that they will have the same experience at other locations with other services. Distance can make it difficult for firms to detect whether or not the franchises are of poor quality.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; One way around this disadvantage is to set up extra subsidiaries in each country or state in which the firm expands. This creates a smaller number of franchisees to oversee, which will reduce the quality control challenges.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

==Obligations of the parties==
Each party to a franchise has several interests to protect.  The franchisor is involved in securing protection for the trademark, controlling the business concept and securing [[know-how]]. The franchisee is obligated to carry out the services for which the trademark has been made prominent or famous. There is a great deal of standardization required. The place of service has to bear the franchisor's signs, logos and trademark in a prominent place. The uniforms worn by the staff of the franchisee have to be of a particular design and color.  The service has to be in accordance with the pattern followed by the franchisor in the successful franchise operations. Thus, franchisees are not in full control of the business, as they would be in retailing.

A service can be successful if equipment and supplies are purchased at a fair price from the franchisor or sources recommended by the franchisor. A coffee brew, for example, can be readily identified by the trademark if its raw materials come from a particular supplier.  If the franchisor requires purchase from her stores, it may come under [[anti-trust legislation]] or equivalent laws of other countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.maslynlaw.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/Supplier-Paper.pdf|format=PDF|title=Contractual and Business Aspects of Structuring Supplier Agreements|website=Maslynlaw.com|accessdate=30 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; So too the purchase things like uniforms of personnel and signs, as well as the franchise sites, if they are owned or controlled by the franchisor.

The franchisee must carefully negotiate the license and must develop a marketing or business plan with the franchisor.  The fees must be fully disclosed and there should not be any hidden fees. The start-up costs and working capital must be known before the license is granted. There must be assurance that additional licensees will not crowd the "territory" if the franchise is worked according to plan. The franchisee must be seen as an independent merchant. It must be protected by the franchisor from any trademark infringement by third parties. A franchise attorney is required to assist the franchisee during negotiations.&lt;ref&gt;''Manual on Technology Transfer Negotiation (A reference for policy-makers and practitioners on Technology Transfer)'', 1996, United Nations Industrial Development Organization, Vienna, 1990, {{ISBN|92-1-106302-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Often the training period – the costs of which are in great part covered by the initial fee – is too short in cases where it is necessary to operate complicated equipment, and the franchisee has to learn on their own from instruction manuals. The training period must be adequate, but in low-cost franchises it may be considered expensive. Many franchisors have set up corporate universities to train staff online. This is in addition to providing literature, sales documents and email access.

Also, franchise agreements carry no guarantees or [[warranty|warranties]] and the franchisee has little or no recourse to legal intervention in the event of a dispute.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Larson|first1=Aaron|title=Should You Invest in a Franchise Opportunity|url=https://www.expertlaw.com/library/business/evaluating_franchise.html|website=ExpertLaw|accessdate=22 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Franchise contracts tend to be unilateral and favor of the franchisor, who is generally protected from lawsuits from their franchisees because of the non-negotiable contracts that franchisees are required to acknowledge, in effect, that they are buying the franchise knowing that there is risk, and that they have not been promised success or profits by the franchisor. Contracts are renewable at the sole option of the franchisor. Most franchisors require franchisees to sign agreements that mandate where and under what law any dispute would be litigated.

==Regulations==
===Australia===
In 2016 there was an estimated 1,120 franchise brands operating in Australia and an estimated 79,000 units operating in business format franchises, with a total brand turnover of approximately $146 billion and a sales revenue of approximately $66.5 billion.&lt;ref name="FA2016"&gt;{{cite web|title=Franchising Australia 2016|url=https://www.franchise.org.au/research.html|website=Franchise Council Of Australia|accessdate=2 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2016 the majority of franchise brands were retailers with the largest segment being non-food retailing, accounting for 26 percent of brands, a further 19 percent of brands were involved in food retailing, 15 percent of franchisors operated in administration and support services, 10 percent in other services, 7 percent in education and training and 7 percent in rental, hire and real estate services.&lt;ref name=FA2016/&gt; 

Franchising in Australia commenced in a significant way in the early 1970s under the influence of the franchised US fast food systems such as [[KFC]], [[Pizza Hut]], and [[McDonald's]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Franchising: An Introduction|url=https://www.franchise.org.au/franchising--an-introduction.html|website=Franchise Council Of Australia|accessdate=2 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was however underway prior to this and a decade earlier in 1960 [[Leslie Joseph Hooker]], considered a pioneer of franchising, created Australia’s first national real estate agency network of [[LJ Hooker|Hooker]] real estate agencies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=L J Hooker, the man behind the brand|url=http://www.abc.net.au/radionational/programs/lifematters/lj-hooker-the-man-behind-the-brand/3007464|website=ABC|accessdate=2 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=LJ Hooker's Heritage, History and Brand|url=https://www.ljhooker.com.au/about-us/lj-hookers-heritage-history-and-brand|website=LJ Hooker|accessdate=2 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Australia, franchising is regulated by the Franchising Code of Conduct, a mandatory [[code of conduct]] concluded under the [[Trade Practices Act 1974]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.legislation.gov.au/Details/F2008C00090%7Ctitle=Trade|title=Federal Register of Legislation – Australian Government|website=Legislation.gov.au|accessdate=11 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The ACCC regulates the Franchising Code of Conduct, which is a mandatory industry code that applies to the parties to a franchise agreement.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://www.comlaw.gov.au/Details/F2014L01472 |title=Archived copy |access-date=2015-08-17 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150607140933/http://www.comlaw.gov.au/Details/F2014L01472 |archive-date=2015-06-07 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;
This code requires franchisors to produce a disclosure document which must be given to a prospective franchisee at least 14 days before the franchise agreement is entered into.

The code also regulates the content of franchise agreements, for example in relation to marketing funds, a [[Standstill period|cooling-off period]], termination, and the [[resolution of disputes]] by [[mediation]].

==== Franchising code of conduct ====

On 1 January 2015, the old Franchising Code was repealed and replaced with a new [https://www.comlaw.gov.au/Details/F2014L01472 Franchising Code of Conduct]. The new Code applies to conduct on or after 1 January 2015.

'''The new Code:'''
* introduces an obligation under the Code for parties to act in good faith in their dealings with one another
* introduces financial penalties and infringement notices for serious breaches of the Code
* requires franchisors to provide prospective franchisees with a short information sheet outlining the risks and rewards of franchising
* requires franchisors to provide greater transparency in the use of and accounting for money used for marketing and advertising and to set up a separate marketing fund for marketing and advertising fees
* requires additional disclosure about the ability of the franchisor and a franchisee to sell online
* prohibits franchisors from imposing significant capital expenditure except in limited circumstances.

These are significant changes and it is important that franchisors, franchisees and potential franchises understand their rights and responsibilities under the Code.

For further information about the changes to the Code, please see the updated Franchisor Compliance Manual and the Franchisee Manual.

The Code explanatory materials are available from the ComLaw website (link is external).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.accc.gov.au/business/industry-codes/franchising-code-of-conduct|title=Franchising Code of Conduct|first=Australian Competition and Consumer|last=Commission|date=11 September 2012|website=Accc.gov.au|accessdate=11 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===New Zealand===
New Zealand is served by around 423 franchise systems operating 450 brands, giving it the highest proportion of franchises per capita in the world. Despite (or because of) the 2008-09 recession, the total number of franchised units increased by 5.3% from 2009 to 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.franchise.co.nz/article/view/1167-survey-finds-franchise-sector-br-resilient-growing|title=survey finds franchise sector  RESILIENT &amp; GROWING – Franchise New Zealand|website=Franchise.co.nz|accessdate=22 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; There is no separate law covering franchises, so they are covered by normal commercial law. This functions very well in New Zealand and includes law as it applies to contracts, restrictive trade practices, intellectual property, and the law of misleading or deceptive conduct.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.franchise.co.nz/article/view/195-legislation-help-or-hindrance-|title=Legislation: Help Or Hindrance?|website=Franchise.co.nz|accessdate=22 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Franchise Association of New Zealand introduced a self-regulatory code of practice for its members in 1996. This contains many provisions similar to those of the Australian Franchising Code of Practice legislation, although only around a third of all franchises are members of the association and therefore bound by the code.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.franchise.co.nz/article/view/117-an-introduction-to-franchising-in-new-zealand|title=an introduction to FRANCHISING IN NEW ZEALAND|website=Franchise.co.nz|accessdate=22 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A case of fraud in 2007 perpetrated by a former master franchisee of the country's largest franchise system&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.franchise.co.nz/article/view/731-green-acres-master-charged-with-fraud|title=Green Acres master charged with fraud|website=Franchise.co.nz|accessdate=22 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; led to a review of the need for franchise law by the Ministry of Economic Development.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.franchise.co.nz/article/view/831|title=Regulation Off the Agenda?|website=Franchise.co.nz|accessdate=22 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The New Zealand Government decided there was no case for franchise-specific legislation at that time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.franchise.co.nz/article/view/838-government-decides-against-franchise-regulation|title=Government Decides AGAINST Franchise Regulation|website=Franchise.co.nz|accessdate=22 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; This decision was criticised by the opposition,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.franchise.co.nz/article/view/839-national-s-failure-to-act-on-franchise-regulation-disappointing-|title=National's failure to act on franchise regulation 'disappointing'|website=Franchise.co.nz|accessdate=22 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; which had initiated the review when in power, and the review process was questioned by a leading academic.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.franchise.co.nz/article/view/1226-franchise-regulation-br-reviewing-the-review|title=franchise regulation REVIEWING THE REVIEW – Franchise New Zealand|website=Franchise.co.nz|accessdate=22 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Franchise Association originally supported the positive regulation of the franchise sector&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.franchise.co.nz/article/view/576-franchise-association-calls-for-positive-regulation|title=Franchise Association Calls For Positive Regulation|website=Franchise.co.nz|accessdate=22 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; but its eventual submission to the review was in favour of the status quo – self-regulation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.franchise.co.nz/article/view/746-ministry-receives-submissions-on-regulation|title=Ministry receives submissions on regulation|website=Franchise.co.nz|accessdate=22 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Brazil===
By the end of 2012, there were about 2,031 franchise brands operating in Brazil, with approximately 93,000 locations,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Geromel|first1=Ricardo|title=Franchising: The Best Way of Investing in Brazil|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/ricardogeromel/2012/07/27/franchising-the-best-way-of-investing-in-brazil/#69289e3a51e5|website=Forbes|accessdate=22 July 2017|date=27 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; making it one of the largest countries in the world in terms of number of units. Around 11 percent of this total were foreign-based franchisors.

The Brazilian Franchise Law (Law No. 8955 of December 15, 1994) defines the franchise as a system in which the franchisor licenses the franchisee, for a payment, the right to use a trademark or patent along with the right to distribute products or services on an exclusive or semi-exclusive basis.
The provision of a "Franchise Offer Circular", or disclosure document, is mandatory before execution of agreement and is valid for all of the Brazilian territory. Failure to disclose voids the agreement, which leads to refunds and serious payments for damages. The Franchise Law does not distinguish between Brazilian and foreign franchisors. The National Institute of Industrial Property (INPI) is the registering authority. Indispensable documents are a Statement of Delivery (of disclosure documentation) and a Certification of Recording (INPI). The latter is necessary for payments. All sums may not be convertible into foreign currency. Certification may also mean compliance with Brazil's antitrust legislation.

Parties to international franchising may decide to adopt the English language for the document, as long as the Brazilian party knows English fluently and expressly acknowledges that fact, to avoid translation. The registration accomplishes three things:

: * It make the agreement effective against third parties
: * It permits the remittance of payments
: * It qualifies the franchisee for tax deductions.

===Canada===
In Canada, recent legislation mandate better disclosure and fair treatment of franchisees. The regulations also ensure their right to form associations and launch collective action, even if they signed contracts prohibiting such moves.  Franchising in Canada involves 1,300 brands, 80,000 franchise units accounting for about 20% of all consumer spending.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Milner|first1=Brian|title=Pity the franchisees|url=https://www.theglobeandmail.com/report-on-business/rob-magazine/why-buying-a-franchise-isnt-as-funor-profitableas-youthink/article37029319/|accessdate=22 November 2017|work=Report on Business|publisher=[[The Globe and Mail]]|date=21 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===China===
China has the most franchises in the world but the scale of their operations is relatively small. Each system in China has an average of 43 outlets, compared to more than 540 in the United States. Together, there are 2600 brands in some 200,000 retail markets. KFC was the most significant foreign entry in 1987 and is widespread &lt;ref name=FIC&gt;[http://www.franchise.org/uploadedFiles/Franchise_Industry/International_Development/franchising%20in%20China.pdf "Franchising in China"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101214152311/http://www.franchise.org/uploadedFiles/Franchise_Industry/International_Development/franchising%20in%20China.pdf |date=2010-12-14 }} ''Franchise.org''&lt;/ref&gt; Many franchises are in fact joint-ventures, as at their forming the franchise law was not explicit. For example, [[McDonald's]] is a joint venture. [[Pizza Hut]], [[T.G.I. Friday's|TGIF]], [[Walmart|Wal-mart]], [[Starbucks]] followed a little later. But total franchising is only 3% of retail trade, which seeks foreign franchise growth.

The year 2005 saw the birth of an updated franchise law,&lt;ref name=FIC/&gt; "Measures for the Administration of Commercial Franchise".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pfa.org.ph/images/stories/PFA/PDF/chinafranchiseregulations.pdf]{{dead link|date=October 2017|bot=InternetArchiveBot|fix-attempted=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; Previous legislation (1997) made no specific inclusion of foreign investors. Today the franchise law is much clearer by virtue of the 2007 law,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.franchise-update.com/article.php?id=316|title=Franchise update – The Definitive Resource For Franchisors|website=Franchising.com|accessdate=22 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; a revision of the 2005 law.

The laws are applicable if there are transactions involving a trademark combined with payments with many obligations on the franchisor. The law comprises 42 articles and eight chapters.

Among the franchisor obligations are:
* The FIE (foreign-invested enterprise) franchisor must be registered by the regulator
* The franchisor (or its subsidiary) must have operated at least two company-owned franchises in China (revised to "anywhere") for more than 12 months ("the two-shop, one-year" rule)
* The franchisor must disclose any information requested by the franchisee
* Cross-border franchising, with some caveats, is possible (2007 law).

The franchisor must meet a list of requirements for registration, among which are:
* The standard franchise agreement, working manual and working capital requirements,
* A track-record of operations, and ample ability to supply materials,
* The ability to train the Chinese personnel and provide long-term operational guidance,
* The franchise agreement must have a minimum three-year term.

Among other provisions:
* The franchisor is liable for certain actions of its suppliers
* Monetary and other penalties apply for infractions of the regulations.

The disclosure must take place 20 days in advance. It has to contain:
* Details of the franchisor's experience in the franchised business with scope of business
* Identification of the franchisor's principal officers
* Litigation of the franchisor during the past five years
* Full details about all franchise fees
* The amount of a franchisee's initial investment
* A list of the goods or services the franchisor can supply, and the terms of supply
* The training franchisees will receive
* Information about the trademarks, including registration, usage and litigation
* Demonstration of the franchisor's capabilities to provide training and guidance
* Statistics about existing units, including number, locations and operational results, and the percentage of franchises that have been terminated, and
* An audited financial report and tax information (for an unspecified period of time).

Other elements of this legislation are:
* The franchisee's confidentiality obligations continue indefinitely after termination or expiration of the franchise agreement
* If the franchisee has paid a deposit to the franchisor, it must be refunded on termination of the franchise agreement; upon termination, the franchisee is prohibited from continuing to use the franchisor's marks.

===India===
The franchising of foreign goods and services to India is in its infancy. The first International Exhibition was only held in 2009.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.franchisebusiness.in/c/Franchising-Association-of-India/Franchise-laws-in-India-n863929|title=Franchise laws in India|website=Franchisebusiness.in|accessdate=22 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;  India is, however, one of the biggest franchising markets because of its large middle-class of 300 million who are not reticent about spending and because the population is entrepreneurial in character. In a highly diversified society, (see [[Demographics of India]]) McDonald's is a success story despite its fare's differing from that of the rest of the world.&lt;ref&gt;''Patterns of Internationalization for Developing Country Enterprises  (Alliances and Joint Ventures)'' United Nations Industrial Development Organization, Vienna, 2008, {{ISBN|978-92-1-106443-8}},&lt;/ref&gt;

So far, franchise agreements are covered under two standard commercial laws: the Contract Act 1872 and the Specific Relief Act 1963, which provide for both specific enforcement of covenants in a contract and remedies in the form of damages for breach of contract.

===Kazakhstan===
In Kazakhstan franchise turnover for 2013 is 2.5 billion US$ dollars per year.  Kazakhstan is the leader in Central Asia in the franchising market. There is a special law on franchising which went into effect in 2002. There are more than 300 franchise systems and the number of franchised outlets approaches 2000.&lt;ref&gt;B.Kissikov  [http://www.kazfranch.kz "Franchising in Kazakhstan"], Kazakhstan Franchise Association&lt;/ref&gt; Kazakhstan franchising began with the emergence of a "Coca-Cola" factory, opened to sublicense a Turkish licensor of the same brand.  The plant was built in 1994. Other brands that are also present in Kazakhstan through the franchise system include Pepsi, Hilton, Marriott, Intercontinental, and Pizza Hut.

===Europe===
Franchising has grown rapidly in Europe in recent years, but the industry is largely unregulated.  Unlike the United States, the European Union has not adopted a uniform franchise law.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=CELEX:31988R4087|title=EUR-Lex – 31988R4087 – EN – EUR-Lex|website=eur-lex.europa.eu|accessdate=11 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Only six of the 28 member states have a pre-contractual disclosure law. They are France (1989), Spain (1996), Romania  (1997), Italy (2004) Sweden ( 2004) and Belgium (2005).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.peralaw.com/franchise_disclosure.html|title=Franchise Disclosure Laws in the European Union|website=Peralaw.com|accessdate=22 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Estonia and Lithuania have franchise laws that impose mandatory terms on franchise agreements.  In Spain there is also mandatory registration on a public registry. Although they have no franchise specific laws, Germany and those countries with a legal system based upon that of Germany, such as Austria, Greece and Portugal, probably impose the greatest regulatory burden on franchisors due to their tendency to treat franchisees as quasi consumers in certain circumstances and the willingness of the judiciary to use the concept of good faith to make pro-franchisee decisions. In the UK, the recent {{when|date=February 2015}} Papa John case shows that there is also a  need for pre-contractual disclosure and the Yam Seng case shows that there is a duty of good faith in franchise relationships.

The European Franchising Federation's Code of Ethics has been adopted by seventeen national franchise associations. However this has no legal force and enforcement by the national associations is neither uniform of rigorous. Commentators like Dr Mark Abell, in his book  "The Law and Regulation of Franchising in the EU" ( Published in 2013 by Edward Elgar {{ISBN|978 1 78195 2207}}) consider this lack of uniformity to be one of the greatest barriers to the franchising realising its potential in the EU.

When adopting a European strategy  it is important that a franchisor takes expert legal advice.  Most often one of the principal tasks in Europe is to find retail space, which is not so significant a factor in the USA. This is where the franchise broker, or the master franchisor, plays an important role. Cultural factors are also relevant, as local populations tend to be heterogeneous.

====France====
France is one of Europe's largest markets. Similar to the United States, it has a long history of franchising, dating back to the 1930s. Growth came in the 1970s. The market is considered difficult for outside franchisors because of cultural characteristics, yet McDonald's and Century 21 are found everywhere. There are some 30 U.S. firms involved in franchising in France.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.franchise.org/franchise-news-detail.aspx?id=33190|title=France Serves as a Gateway to Europe – International Franchise Association|website=Franchise.org|accessdate=30 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are no government agencies regulating franchises. The Loi Doubin Law of 1989 was the first European franchise disclosure law. Combined with Decree No. 91-337, it regulates disclosure, although the decree also applies to any person who provides to another person a corporate name, trademark or trade name or other business arrangements.  The law applies to "exclusive or quasi-exclusive territory". The disclosure document must be delivered at least 20 days before the execution of the agreement or any payments are made.

The specific and important disclosures to be made are:&lt;ref name=EUFD&gt;[http://www.peralaw.com/EU_Franchise_Disclosure.html EU Franchise Disclosure] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140527213507/http://www.peralaw.com/EU_Franchise_Disclosure.html |date=2014-05-27 }} ''peralaw.com''&lt;/ref&gt;

#  The date of the founding of the franchisor's enterprise and a summary of its business history and all information necessary to assess the business experience of the franchisor, including bankers,
#  A description of the local market for the goods or services,
#  The franchisor's financial statements for the previous two years,
#  A list of all other franchisees currently in the network,
#  All franchisees who have left the network during the preceding year, whether by termination or non-renewal, and
#  The conditions for renewal, assignment, termination and the scope of exclusivity.

Initially, there was some uncertainty whether any
breach of the provisions of the Doubin Law would
enable the franchisee to walk away from the contract.
However, the French supreme court (Cour de cassation)
eventually ruled that agreements should only be
annulled where missing or incorrect information
affected the decision of the franchisee to enter into the
agreement. The burden of proof is on the franchisee.
&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ffw.com/pdf/Franchise-disclosure-in-Europe.pdf|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110710235841/http://www.ffw.com/pdf/Franchise-disclosure-in-Europe.pdf|dead-url=yes|archive-date=10 July 2011|title=Wayback Machine|date=10 July 2011|accessdate=30 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Dispute settlement features are only incorporated in some European countries. By not being rigorous, franchising is encouraged.

====Italy====
Under Italian law franchise  &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.eurofranchiselawyers.com/pdf/Comparative_Table_08_06_09%20printable.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-02-28 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110710204622/http://www.eurofranchiselawyers.com/pdf/Comparative_Table_08_06_09%20printable.pdf |archivedate=2011-07-10 |df= }} ''EuroFranchiseLawyers.com''&lt;/ref&gt; is defined as an arrangement between two financially independent parties where a franchisee is granted, in exchange for a consideration, the right to market goods and services under particular trademarks.  In addition, articles dictate the form and content of the franchise agreement and define the documents that must be made available 30 days prior to execution. The franchisor must disclose:

:a)  A summary of the franchise activities and operations,
:b)  A list of franchisees currently operating in the franchise system in Italy,
:c)  Year-by-year details of the changes in the number of franchisees for the previous three years in Italy,
:d)  A summary of any court or arbitral proceedings in Italy related to the franchise system, and
:e)  If requested by the franchisee, copies of franchisor's balance sheets for the previous three years, or since start-up if that period is shorter.

====Norway====
There are no specific laws regulating franchising in Norway. However, the Norwegian Competition Act section 10 prohibits cooperation which may prevent, limit or diminish the competition. This may also apply to vertical cooperation such as franchising..

====Russia====
In Russia, under chapter 54 of the Civil Code (passed 1996), franchise agreements are invalid unless written and registered, and franchisors cannot set standards or limits on the prices of the franchisee's goods. Enforcement of laws and resolution of contractual disputes is a problem:{{citation needed|date=October 2011}} [[Dunkin' Donuts]] chose to terminate its contract with Russian franchisees who were selling vodka and meat patties contrary to their contracts, rather than pursue legal remedies.&lt;ref&gt;Anttonen, Noora, Mika Tuunanen, Ilan Alon (2005), "The International Business Environments of Franchising in Russia," Academy of Marketing Science Review, (5), 1–18.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Spain====
The legal definition of franchising in Spain is an activity in which an undertaking, the franchisor, grants to another party, the franchisee, for a specific market and in exchange for financial compensation (either direct, indirect or both), the right to exploit an owned system to commercialize products or services already exploited by the franchisor with enough success and experience.

The Spanish Retail Trading Act regulates franchising.&lt;ref&gt;The offer and sale of franchises are governed in Spain by the Retail Trade Act 7/1996 of January 15 as amended by [http://www.boe.es/boe/dias/2010/03/02/pdfs/BOE-A-2010-3365.pdf Act 1/2010 of March 1]. Particularly Article 62 is applicable to franchise agreements. The Act is completed by the [http://www.boe.es/boe/dias/2010/03/13/pdfs/BOE-A-2010-4175.pdf Royal Decree 210/2010 of February 26 on Franchise Agreements].&lt;/ref&gt; The contents of the franchise must include, at least:
* The use of a common name or brand or any other intellectual property right and a uniform presentation of the premises or the transport means included in the agreement.
* The communication by the franchisor to the franchise of certain technical knowledge or substantial and singular know-how that has to be owned by the franchisor, and
* Technical or commercial assistance or both, provided by the franchisor to the franchisee during the agreement, without prejudice to any supervision faculty to which the parties could freely agree in the contract.

In Spain, the franchisor submits the disclosure information 20 days prior to signing the agreement or prior to any payment made by the franchisee to the franchisor. Franchisors are to disclose to the potential franchisee specific information in writing. This information has to be true and not misleading and include:
* Identification of the franchisor;
* Justification of ownership or license for use of any trademark or similar sign and judicial claims affecting them as well as the duration of the license;
* General description of the sector in which the franchise operates;
* Experience of the franchisor;
* Contents and characteristics of the franchise and its exploitation;
* Structure and extension of the network in Spain;
* Essential elements of the franchise agreement.

Franchisors (with some exceptions) should be registered in the Franchisors' Register and provide the requested information. According to the regulation in force in 2010 this obligation has to be met within three months after the start of its activities in Spain.&lt;ref&gt;See also Spain Chapter of ''[http://www.GettingTheDealThrough.com Getting the Deal Through. Franchise 2011]'' by [http://www.advocatia.net/profesional.asp?id=2 Ignacio Alonso]&lt;/ref&gt;

====Turkey====

Franchising is a [[sui generis]] contract which bears the characteristics of several explicitly regulated contracts such as; agency, sales contract and so forth. The regulations concerning these kinds of contracts in Turkish Commercial Code and in Turkish Code of Obligations are applied to franchising. Franchising is described in doctrine and has several essential components such as; the independence of the franchisee from the franchisor, the use of know-how and the uniformity of product and services, standard use of the brand and logo, payment of a royalty fee, increasement of sales by the franchisee and continuity.
Franchising may be for a determined or undetermined period of time. The undetermined one can only be annulled either by a notice before a reasonable amount of time or by a just cause. The franchising agreement with a determined time period ends within the end of the time period if not specified otherwise in the agreement. However, termination based on just cause is also foreseen for franchising agreement with a determined time period.

====United Kingdom====
In the United Kingdom there are no franchise-specific laws; franchises are subject to the same laws that govern other businesses.&lt;ref&gt;However the recent Pappa Johns case shows that the courts will expect clear disclosure of relevant facts by the franchisor before the franchisee signs up and the recent Yam Seng  case clearly establishes that the franchise relationship involves a duty of good faith. The Trading Schemes Act also regulates Multi tier franchises  [http://www.selectyourfranchise.com/franchise-blog/2009/10/franchise-agreements-subject-to-european-code-of-ethics/ Franchise agreements subject to European Code of ethics] (blog)&lt;/ref&gt; There is some self-regulation through the British Franchise Association (BFA).

There are a number franchise businesses which are not members of the BFA and many which do not meet the BFA membership criteria. Part of the BFA's role in self-regulation is to work with franchisors through the application process and recommend changes which will lead to the franchise business meeting BFA standards.  A number of businesses that refer to themselves as franchises do not conform to the BFA Code of Ethics are therefore excluded from membership.

On 22 May 2007, hearings were held in the UK Parliament concerning citizen-initiated petitions for special regulation of franchising by the government of the UK due to losses incurred by citizens who had invested in franchises. The Minister of Industry, Margaret Hodge, conducted hearings but saw no need for any government regulation of franchising with the advice that government regulation of franchising might lull the public into a false sense of security. Mr Mark Prisk MP suggested that the costs of such regulation to the franchisee and franchisor could be prohibitive and would in any case provide a system which mirrored the work already being completed by the BFA. The Minister of Industry indicated that if due diligence were performed by the investors and the banks, the current laws governing business contracts in the UK offered sufficient protection for the public and the banks. The debate also made reference to the self-regulatory function performed by the BFA recognizing that the association "punched above its weight".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |journal=Daily Hansard |date=22 May 2007 |pages= 363WH; [https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200607/cmhansrd/cm070522/halltext/70522h0001.htm part 1], [https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200607/cmhansrd/cm070522/halltext/70522h0002.htm part 2], [https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200607/cmhansrd/cm070522/halltext/70522h0003.htm part 3] |title=Franchise Industry|nopp=true}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===United States===
[[Isaac Singer]], who made improvements to an existing model of a sewing machine in the 1850s, began one of the first franchising efforts in the United States, followed later by [[Coca-Cola]], [[Western Union]],  etc.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.referenceforbusiness.com/encyclopedia/For-Gol/Franchising.html|title=Franchising – benefits|website=Referenceforbusiness.com|accessdate=22 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; and by agreements between automobile manufacturers and dealers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.thefranchiseking.com/issac-singer-the-first-franchise |title=It's Issac Singer's Fault |author= |publisher='The Franchise King' |page= |date= |accessdate=October 28, 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Modern franchising came to prominence with the rise of franchise-based food service establishments. In 1932, Howard Deering Johnson established the first modern restaurant franchise based on his successful Quincy, Massachusetts [[Howard Johnson's]] restaurant founded in the late 1920s.&lt;ref&gt;Allen, kolin chakma.[https://archive.is/20120715222511/http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m3190/is_n4_v32/ai_20199526 Foodservice's theory of evolution: Survival of the fittest] (1998).

The growth in franchising accelerated in the 1930s when such chains as [[Howard Johnson's]] started to franchise motels.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Franchising: A Brief History|url=http://www.wdfi.org/fi/securities/franchise/history.htm|website=State of Wisconsin Department of Financial Institutions|accessdate=22 July 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170730213741/http://www.wdfi.org/fi/securities/franchise/history.htm|archive-date=2017-07-30|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The 1950s saw a boom in franchise chains in conjunction with the development of the U.S. Interstate Highway System and the growing popularity of [[fast food]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.franchise-law.com/franchise-law-overview/a-brief-history-of-franchising.shtml#|title=A Brief History of Franchising – American Franchise Attorney {{!}} Washington D.C., U.S. {{!}} Franchise Law|website=Franchise-law.com|language=en-US|access-date=2017-06-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the United States, the [[Federal Trade Commission]] has oversight of franchising, rather than the U.S. [[Securities and Exchange Commission]]. The FTC administrates oversight via the FTC Franchise Rule.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ftc.gov/os/fedreg/2007/march/070330franchiserulefrnotice.pdf#page=102|title=Disclosure Requirements and Prohibitions Concerning Franchising &amp; Disclosure Requirements Concerning Business Opportunities – 16 CFR Parts 436 and 437|website=Ftc.gov|accessdate=22 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The FTC requires that the franchisee be furnished with a [[Franchise Disclosure Document]] (FDD) by the franchisor at least fourteen days before money changes hands or a franchise agreement is signed. The final agreement is always a negotiated document setting forth fees and other terms. Whereas elements of the disclosure may be available from third parties, only that provided by the franchisor can be depended upon. The U.S. Franchise Disclosure Document (FDD) is lengthy (300–700 pp +) and detailed (see Uniform Franchise Offering Circular (UFOC) for elements of disclosure), and generally requires audited financial statements from the franchisor in a particular format, except in some circumstances, such as where a franchisor is new. It must include such data as the names, addresses and telephone numbers of the franchisees in the licensed territory (who may be contacted and consulted before negotiations), estimate of total franchise revenues and franchisor profitability.

Individual states may require the FDD to contain their own specific requirements, but the requirements in state disclosure documents must be in compliance with the federal rule that governs federal regulatory policy. There is no [[private right of action]] of action under the FTC rule for franchisor violation of the rule, but fifteen or more of the states have passed statutes that provide this right of action to franchisees when fraud can be proven under these special statutes. The majority of franchisors have inserted mandatory arbitration clauses into their agreements with their franchisees, some of which the U.S. Supreme Court has dealt with.

There is no federal registry of franchises or any federal filing requirements for information. States are the primary collectors of data on franchising companies and enforce laws and regulations regarding their presence and their spread in their jurisdictions.

Where the franchisor has many partners, the agreement may take the shape of a business format franchise – an agreement that is identical for all franchisees.

==Social franchises==
In recent years, the idea of franchising has been picked up by the [[social enterprise]] sector, which hopes to simplify and expedite the process of setting up new businesses. A number of business ideas, such as soap making, wholefood retailing, aquarium maintenance, and hotel operation have been identified as suitable for adoption by social firms employing disabled and disadvantaged people.

The most successful examples are probably the ''Kringwinkel'' second-hand shops employing 5,000 people in Flanders, franchised by KOMOSIE,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.komosie.be/|title=Home – Komosie|website=Komosie.be|accessdate=22 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; the [[CAP Markets]], a steadily growing chain of 100 neighbourhood [[supermarket]]s in Germany.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cap-markt.de|title=CAP-Markt: CAP Märkte|website=Cap-markt.de|accessdate=22 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the Hotel Tritone in [[Trieste]], which inspired the Le Mat social franchise, now active in Italy and Sweden.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://lemat.it/en/the-brand/le-mat-europe|title=Le Mat Europe – Pagine Statiche – Le Mat Europe|website=Lemat.it|accessdate=22 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Social franchising]] also refers to a technique used by governments and aid donors to provide essential clinical health services in the developing world.

Social Franchise Enterprises objective is to achieve development goals by creating self sustainable activities by providing services and goods in un-served areas. They use the Franchise Model characteristics to deliver Capacity Building, Access to Market and Access to Credit/Finance.&lt;ref&gt;Alvaro Hidalgo,''[http://www.wattjet.com/pdf/SocialFranchiseEntreprise.pdf%20 The Franchise as a Development tool] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140513011056/http://www.wattjet.com/pdf/SocialFranchiseEntreprise.pdf |date=2014-05-13 }}''&lt;/ref&gt;

==Third-party logistics franchising==
[[Third-party logistics]] has become an increasingly more popular franchise opportunity due the quickly growing transportation industry &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.businessinsider.com/trucking-industry-infographic-2013-4|title=Trucking Industry Infographic – Business Insider|date=9 April 2013|work=Business Insider|accessdate=22 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; and low cost franchising.  In 2012, ''Inc. Magazine'' ranked three [[logistics and transportation]] companies in the top 100 fastest growing companies in the annual Inc. 5000 rankings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.inc.com/inc5000/list/2012/industry/logistics-transportation|title=Top Logistics &amp; Transportation Companies on the Inc. 5000 |website=Inc.com|accessdate=22 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Event franchising==
Event franchising is the duplication of public [[media event|events]] in other geographical areas, retaining the original [[brand]] ([[logo]]), mission, concept and format of the event.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Kissikov Beknur |title=Franchising |date= |isbn= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  As in classic franchising, event franchising is built on precisely copying successful events. An example of event franchising is the [[World Economic Forum]], also known as the [[Davos]] forum, which has regional event franchisees in China, Latin America, etc. Likewise, the alter-globalist [[World Social Forum]] has launched many national events. [[When the Music Stops (dating service)|When The Music Stops]] is an example of an events franchise in the UK, in this case, running [[speed dating]] and singles events.

==Home-based franchises==
The franchising or duplication of another firm's successful [[home business|home-based business]] model is referred to as a home-based franchise. Home-based franchises are becoming popular as they are considered to be an easy way to start a business as they may provide a low barrier for entry into [[entrepreneurship]]. It may cost little to start a home-based franchise, but experts say that "the work is no less hard."&lt;ref name=Inc.com&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.inc.com/guides/2010/05/start-home-based-franchise.html |title=How to Start a Home-Based Franchise |author=Issie Lapowsky |publisher=''Mansueto Ventures'' |magazine=[[Inc.

The '''German Research Institute for Public Administration''' (''GRIP'', [[German language|German]]: ''Deutsches Forschungsinstitut für öffentliche Verwaltung, FÖV'') is a non-university [[research institute]] for [[public administration]] located in [[Speyer]], [[Rhineland Palatinate]], [[Germany]]. Founded in 1976 as an organizationally independent institution under the jurisdiction of the [[List of Ministers-President of Rhineland-Palatinate|Minister-President of Rhineland-Palatinate]], it is largely integrated in, and maintains a strategic partnership with the [[German University of Administrative Sciences Speyer]]. As an "institution of nationwide interest" it forms part of the [[Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz Scientific Community]] and is thus funded equally by the [[Federal Republic of Germany|Federal Republic]]  and [[States of Germany|all 16 German states]]. At present the institute has 26 ordinary, 19 corresponding and two honorary [[fellow]]s from Germany and abroad.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nesse.fr/nesse/activities/research-mapping/educational-governance/institutions/forschungsinstitut-fur-offentliche-verwaltung-bei-der-deutschen-hochschule-fur-verwaltungswissenschaften-speyer-the-research-institute-for-public-administration-at-the-german-university-of-administrative-sciences-speyer-fov

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="16477">'''HYPO''' is a computer program that models reasoning with cases and [[hypotheticals]] in the legal domain. It is the first of its kind and the most sophisticated of the case-based legal reasoners, which was designed by Ashley for his Ph.D [[dissertation]] in 1987 at the [[University of Massachusetts Amherst]] under the supervision of Rissland. HYPO’s design represents a [[hybrid computer|hybrid]] generalization/comparative evaluation method appropriate for a domain with a weak analytical theory and applies to tasks that rarely involve just one right answer.&lt;ref&gt;Ashley, K.D., Reasoning with cases and hypotheticals in HYPO, (1991), International Journal Man-Machine St. 34(6), pp. 753-796&lt;/ref&gt; The domain covers US [[trade secret]] law, and is substantially a "[[common law]]" domain. Since the [[Anglo-American law]] is operated under the doctrine of [[precedent]], the definitive way of interpreting problems is of necessity and case-based.&lt;ref name="Rissland1"&gt;Rissland, E.L. and Skalak, D.B., Case-Based Reasoning in a Rule-Governed Domain, (1989) In Proceedings of the Fifth IEEE Conference on Artificial Intelligence Applications 1989, Institute of Electrical and Electronic Engineers Inc.&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, HYPO did not involve the analysis of a [[Statute]], as required by the [[PROLOG]] [[Computer program|program]]. Rissland and Ashley (1987) envisioned HYPO as employing the key tasks performed by lawyers when analyzing [[case law]] for precedence to generate arguments for the [[prosecution]] or the [[defense (legal)|defence]].&lt;ref name="Delgado"&gt;Delgado P. Survey of Case-Based Reasoning as Applied to the Legal Domain&lt;/ref&gt;

HYPO was a successful example of a general category of legal [[expert systems]] (LESs), it applied [[artificial intelligence]] (A.I.) techniques to the domain of legal reasoning in [[patent law]], implementing a [[case-based reasoning]] (CBR) system, in contradiction to rule based systems like [[MYCIN]], or mixed-paradigm systems integrating CBR with rule-based or model-based reasoning like IKBALS II. A legal case-based reasoning essentially reasons from previously [[tried]] cases, comparing the contextual information in the current input case with that of cases previously tried and entered into the system.&lt;ref name="Vossos"&gt;Vossos, G., Zeleznikow, J., Dillon, T., Vossos, V., An example of Integrating Legal Case Based Reasoning with Object-Oriented Rule-Based Systems: IKBALS II , (1991) In Proceedings of the Third International Conference on Artificial Intelligence and Law, 31-41, Oxford, England&lt;/ref&gt; As noted by Ashley and Rissland (1988) CBR is used to "... capture expertise in domains where rules are ill-defined, incomplete or inconsistent".&lt;ref&gt;Kolodner, J.L., An Introduction to Case-Based Reasoning, (1992), Artificial Intelligence Review 6, pp.3-34. O’ Leary, D.E. Verification and Validation of Case-Based Systems, (1993), Expert Systems with Applications 6, pp.57-66&lt;/ref&gt;

The HYPO project set out to model the creation of hypotheticals in law, where no case matches well enough. HYPO uses hypotheticals for a variety of tasks necessary for good interpretation: "to redefine old situations in terms of new dimensions, to create new standard cases when an appropriate one doesn’t exist, to explore and test the limits of a concept, to refocus a case by excluding some issues and to organize or cluster cases".&lt;ref&gt;Ashley, K.D. and Rissland E.L., A case-based approach to modeling legal expertise, (1988), IEEE Expert 3, pp. 70-77.&lt;/ref&gt; Hypotheticals can include facts that support two conflicting lines of reasoning. So, it makes and responds to arguments from competing viewpoints about who should win the dispute. HYPO use [[heuristic]]s such as making a case weaker or stronger, making a case extreme, enabling a "[[near miss (safety)|near-miss]]", disabling a "near-hit" to generate hypotheticals in the context of an argument by using the [[dimensions mechanism]].&lt;ref name="Rissland2"&gt;Rissland, E.L. and Ashley, K.D., A case-based system for trade secrets law, (1987) In Proceedings 1987 ACM International Conference on Artificial Intelligence and Law&lt;/ref&gt; Dimensions have a range of values, along which the supportive strength that may shift from one side to the other.&lt;ref&gt;Zeng, Y., Wang, R. , Zeleznikow, J., Kemp, E., A Knowledge Representation model for the intelligent retrieval of legal cases, (2007), International Journal of Law and Information Technology 15(3), pp. 299-319&lt;/ref&gt; What [[differentiation (economics)|differentiated]] this expert system from others was its facility not only to return a primary to best-case response but to return near-best-fit responses as well.

==Components==
Legal knowledge in HYPO is contained in: the case-knowledge-base (CKB) and the library of dimensions. The CKB contains HYPO’s base of known cases that are highly structured objects and sub-objects both real and hypothetical in the area of trade secret law. Each case is represented as a [[hierarchical]] set of frames whose slots are important facets of the case (e.g. [[Plaintiff]], [[defendant]], [[secret knowledge]], employer/employee data).&lt;ref name="Rissland2"/&gt;{{rp|62}}Ashley’s HYPO system used a [[database]] of thirty cases in the area [[index mapping|indexed]] by thirteen dimensions. 
A key mechanism in HYPO is a dimension i.e. a mechanism to allow [[Information retrieval|retrieval]] from the CKB, in order to represent legal cases. Ashley’s dimensions are composed of (i) prerequisites, which are a set of factual [[First-order logic|predicates]] that must be satisfied for the dimension to apply (ii) focal slots, which accommodate one or two of the dimension’s prerequisites designated as being indicative of the case’s strength along that dimension and (iii) range information, which tells how a change in focal slot value effects the strength of a party’s case along a given dimension.&lt;ref name="Vossos"/&gt;{{rp|34–35}} Dimensions focus attention on important aspects of cases. In HYPO’s domain of [[misappropriation]] of trade secrets the dimension called “secrets voluntary disclosed” captures the idea that the more disclosures the plaintiff has made of his/her putative secret, the less convincing is his/her argument that the defendant is responsible for letting the secret.&lt;ref&gt;Rissland, E.L., A.I. and Similarity, (2006), IEEE Intelligent Systems, 21(3), pp. 39-49&lt;/ref&gt;

HYPO, like any other CBR system has also the following components:

* Similarity/relevancy [[Software metric|metric]]s: that is, standards by which to evaluate the closeness of cases, judge their relevancy to the instant case, and select “most on point” cases.
* Half-Order Theory of the Application Domain: that is, hierarchies and taxonomies of knowledge, especially regarding the application domain.
* Precedent-based argumentation abilities: that is, capabilities to generate and evaluate precedent-based arguments.
* Knowledge to generate hypotheticals: that is, the ability to generate hypothetical cases to deal with various circumstances, like testing the validity of an interpretation or argument by providing ''[[gedanken]]'' experiments such as test cases or to fill in a weak CKB.&lt;ref name="Rissland1"/&gt;{{rp|49–50}}

==Functionality==
HYPO’s method of creating an argument and justifying a solution or position has several steps. HYPO begins its processing with the current fact situation ("cfs") which is direct input by the user into HYPO’s representation framework. Once the user inputs the case, HYPO begins its legal analysis. The cfc is analyzed for relevant factors. Based on these factors HYPO selects the relevant cases and produces a case-analysis-record that records which dimensions apply to the cfc and which nearly apply (i.e. are "near misses"). The combined list of applicable and near miss dimensions is called the D-list. At this point the fact gathered module may request additional information from the user in order to draw a legal conclusion. Once all the facts are in the case-positioner module it uses the case-analysis record to create the claim [[wikt:lattice|lattice]]. This is a technique that organizes the relevant retrieved cases from the point of view of the cfc and makes it easy for HYPO to ascertain the most-on point cases (mopc) and to least on-point-cases.&lt;ref name="Rissland2"/&gt;{{rp|62}} HYPO’s arguments are 3ply, leading to the construction of the skeleton of an argument: it makes a point for one side, drawing the analogy between the problem and the precedent, responds with an argument for the opponent side, endeavoring to differentiate the cited case and citing other cases as [[counterarguments]]. Then it makes a final [[rebuttal]], attempting to differentiate the counterarguments.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Popple|first=J.|author-link=James Popple|title=A Pragmatic Legal Expert System|year=1996|publisher=Dartmouth (Ashgate)|series=Applied Legal Philosophy Series|isbn=1-85521-739-2|pages=42–43|url=http://cs.anu.edu.au/~James.Popple/publications/books/shyster.pdf|format=PDF|archiveurl=https://archive.org/details/APragmaticLegalExpertSystem|archivedate=28 December 2006|deadurl=no|accessdate=7 August 2014}} Also {{Google books|ZyfNAgAAQBAJ|available}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The claim lattice also enables the HYPO-generator module to produce legally hypotheticals. With its use of dimension-based heuristics, the HYPO-generator does a [[heuristic search]] of the space of all possible cases. Lastly, the Explanation module expands upon the argument skeleton and provides explanation and justification for the different lines of analysis and cases found by HYPO.&lt;ref name="Rissland2"/&gt;{{rp|62}}

==An intelligent legal tutoring system==
[[Legal expert system]]s are specifically designed to teach an area of law and are useful for [[pedagogical]] purposes. Ashley’s work was mainly concerned to build tools to help students understand legal reasoning.&lt;ref&gt;Zeleznikow, J. and Hunter, D., Rationales for the Continued Development of Legal Expert Systems, (1992), 3, J.L. &amp; Inf. Sci. 94&lt;/ref&gt; Explanation and argument are the bases of the case method used in many [[professional schools]] in the U.S., first introduced by the [[Dean (education)|Dean]] of the [[Harvard Law School]], [[Christopher Columbus Langdell]] in 1870. The [[case method]] focuses on close readings of cases and principles; it involves students in pointed [[Socratic dialogue]] and makes strong use of hypotheticals (“hypos”).&lt;ref name="Vossos"/&gt;{{rp| 40–41}} Thus, CATO (Aleven 1997)&lt;ref&gt;Aleven, V., and Ashley, K.D., 1997, Evaluating a Learning Environment for Case Based Argumentation Skills, in Proceedings of the Sixth International Conference on Artificial Intelligence and Law, Melbourne, ACM Press, New York. pp 170-179&lt;/ref&gt; was a [[research project]] to device and test an intelligent, case-based [[tutorial]] program for teaching law students how to argue with cases implementing the HYPO program.&lt;ref name=Ashley-Aleven-1991&gt;Ashley, K.D. and Aleven, V., Toward an Intelligent Tutoring System for Teaching Law Students to argue with cases, (1991) In Proceedings of the Third International Conference on Artificial Intelligence and Law, 42-52, Oxford, England&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Ashley-Aleven-1991"/&gt;
Within the tutor system, Ashley and Aleven (1991) &lt;ref&gt;Ashley-Aleven-1991&lt;/ref&gt; proposed to [[leverage (negotiation)|leverage]] an understanding of legal reasoning against the standard case-based tutoring methodology. What makes this tutoring system stand out is the additional levels of [[abstraction]] involved in its results.&lt;ref name="Delgado"/&gt; The system presents exercises, including the facts of a problem and a set of [[on-line]] cases and instructions to make, or respond to, a legal argument about the problem. The student/user will have a set of tools to analyze the problem and fashion an answer comparing it to other cases. Instead of simply generating precedent cases, the system actually functions in such a way as to interpret student responses, comparing them against a list of possibilities and responding to student entries, for example, by citing counterexamples, and providing [[feedback]] on a student's problem solving activities with explanations of correctness or giving further hints as to what may be wrong with evaluating a student’s ability to perform legal reasoning and argumentation, examples and follow-up assignments by employing HYPO’s model of case-based structure.&lt;ref&gt;Ashley, K.D., Case-Based Reasoning and its Implications for Legal Expert Systems, (1992), Artificial Intelligence and Law 1, pp. 113-208&lt;/ref&gt;

==HYPO’s progeny==
The quality of HYPO’s results speak for themselves, in that a number of sequent legal reasoning systems are either directly based upon HYPO’s mechanisms as in the case of Kowalski (1991),&lt;ref&gt;Kowalski, A., Case-based reasoning and the deep structure approach to knowledge representation, (1991) Proceedings of the 3rd international conference on Artificial intelligence and law, 21-30&lt;/ref&gt; TAX-HYPO, precedent case-based system operating in the statutory domain of [[tax law]] (Rissland and Skalak 1989), CABARET, a mixed-paradigm cases and rule system for the income tax law domain, (Skalak and Rissland 1992), CATO, IBP, developed for argumentation to make predictions based on argumentation concepts (Brüninghaus and Ashley 2003), or their creators at least pay homage to HYPO in their discussions (Henderson and Bench-Capon 2001&lt;ref&gt;Henderson, J. &amp; Bench-Capon, T, Dynamic arguments in a case law domain, (2001) Proceedings of the 8th international conference on Artificial intelligence and law, 60-69.&lt;/ref&gt;).

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4827">The '''Hazard Communication Standard''' requires employers in the United States to disclose toxic and hazardous substances in workplaces. This is related to the [[Worker Protection Standard]].

Specifically, this requires unrestricted employee access to the [[Material Safety Data Sheet]] or equivalent, and appropriate training needed to understand health and safety risks.

==History==

Workplace safety in the USA began with Dr. Alice Hamilton in Chicago, who began working for the state of Illinois in 1910 to deal with workplace safety.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nlm.nih.gov/changingthefaceofmedicine/physicians/biography_137.html|title=Biography: Dr. Alice Hamilton|publisher=National Library of Medicine}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Occupational Safety and Health Administration]] was established in 1970 to standardize safety for all workers in the United States, and hazard communication for toxic substance exposure was included during the 1980s.

The Globally Harmonized System of Classification and Labeling of Chemicals (GHS) is currently being pursued to standardize workplace hazard protection internationally.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.osha.gov/dsg/hazcom/ghs.html|title=A Guide to The Globally Harmonized System of Classification and Labeling of Chemicals|publisher=US OSHA}}&lt;/ref&gt;

OSHA's Hazard Communication Standard (HAZCOM) was first adopted in 1983 in the United States with limited scope (48 FR 53280; November 25, 1983). In 1987, scope was expanded to cover all industries where employees are potentially exposed to hazardous chemicals (52 FR 31852; August 24, 1987). This is managed by the [[Occupational Safety and Health Administration]]. [http://www.osha.gov/dcsp/osp/index.html This is managed by states that have an approved plan].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.osha.gov/dcsp/osp/index.html|title=State Occupational Safety and Health Plans|publisher=United States Department of Labor}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The standard is identified in [http://www.osha.gov/pls/oshaweb/owadisp.show_document?p_table=standards&amp;p_id=10099 29 C.F.R. 1910.1200].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.osha.gov/pls/oshaweb/owadisp.show_document?p_table=standards&amp;p_id=10099|title=Occupational Safety and Health Standards; Toxic and Hazardous Substances; Hazard Communication|publisher=United States Department of Labor}}&lt;/ref&gt; The summary is as follows.

''Employers shall maintain copies of any material safety data sheets ...  and shall ensure that the material safety data sheets are readily accessible during each work shift to employees when they are in  their work area(s); and Employers shall ensure that employees are provided with information and training ... to detect the presence or release of a hazardous  chemical in the work area ... &lt;and&gt; the physical and health hazards of the chemials in the work area ...''

The United States Department of Defense does not manage hazards in accordance with public law.

==Purpose==

Employees access to hazard information is one of the prerequisites required for access to competent medical diagnosis and treatment.

Environmental illness share characteristics with common diseases. [[Cyanide]] exposure symptoms include weakness, headache, nausea, confusion, dizziness, seizures, cardiac arrest, and unconsciousness.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ohioline.osu.edu/b745/b745_4.html|title=Pesticide User's Guide|publisher=Ohio State University}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.health.state.ny.us/environmental/emergency/chemical_terrorism/cyanide_general.htm|title=The Facts About Cyanides|publisher=New York Department of Health}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Influenza]] and [[heart disease]] include the same symptoms. Failure to obtain proper disclosure is likely to lead to improper or ineffective medical diagnosis and treatment.

The Hazard Communication Standard requires the [[Material Safety Data Sheet]] to be made readily available for workplace exposure in the United States, because this information is required by physicians so they can do their job.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.osha.gov/pls/oshaweb/owadisp.show_document?p_table=standards&amp;p_id=10099|title=29 CFR, Standard 1910.1200, Hazard Communication|publisher=United States Occupational Safety and Health Administration}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Physicians also require epidemiological data maintained by local government agencies responsible for maintaining pesticide application data for use outside buildings (environmental exposure).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cdpr.ca.gov/docs/pur/purmain.htm|title=Pesticide Use Reporting (PUR)|publisher=California Department of Pesticide Regulation}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is part of the [[Right to know]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3774">The '''Housing Grants, Construction and Regeneration Act 1996''' is an [[Act of Parliament]] of the [[United Kingdom]].  Its [[long title]] shows that it is a piece of omnibus legislation:

:''An Act to make provision for grants and other assistance for housing purposes and about action in relation to unfit housing; to amend the law relating to construction contracts and architects; to provide grants and other assistance for [[Urban renewal|regeneration]] and development and in connection with clearance areas; to amend the provisions relating to home energy efficiency schemes; to make provision in connection with the dissolution of urban corporations, housing action trusts and the [[Commission for New Towns]]; and for connected purposes.''

Part III of the Act &lt;ref&gt;Part III E+W+S+N.I. Architects [http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1996/53/part/III/1996-10-01?timeline=true]&lt;/ref&gt; relating to [[Architects Registration in the United Kingdom|architects' registration]] has been repealed and reenacted as the [[Architects Act 1997]], under the Parliamentary rules for consolidating Acts.

==Disabled Facilities Grants (DFGs)==

The act provides legislation for the provision of grant aided adaptations for disabled persons' properties within the UK. This is covered in part 1 Chapter 1. The aim of this part of the Act is to allow for provision of adaptations to disabled persons' homes to reduce both the need for people to relocate to facilities which provide full-time care and to reduce the amount of care needed in people's homes. One way this is provided for is in the provision of stairlifts allowing people to continue use of bathroom facilities in the upstairs of their homes. [[Local authorities]] may carry out the work either through provision of money to the applicant or through an agency service. Where an agency service is offered grant applicants are not obliged to take this up in order to receive a grant. In order for adaptation's to be provided an [[occupational therapist]] is usually required to carry out an assessment of the needs of the applicant. 

A grant can be used for adaptations to give better freedom of movement into and around the home and/or to provide essential facilities within it. Examples of the work which may be covered by this assistance are:

* widening doors and installing ramps 
* providing or improving access to rooms and facilities - for example, by installing a stair lift or providing a downstairs bathroom
* bathroom conversion e.g. providing level access shower, accessible WC and wash hand basin
* improving or providing a heating system which is suitable for the disabled person's needs
* improving access to and movement around the home to enable you to care for another person who lives in the property, such as a child
* alterations to door widths and ramps
* specialist equipment i.e. baths/ kitchens

The maximum mandatory values of works is £30,000 in England; however the local authority can use discretionary powers released through a later RRO to increase the value of works.

==Construction Industry==
Part 2 of the Housing Grants, Construction and Regeneration Act 1996 relates to payments in the construction industry. This part was later amended by Part 8 of the [[Local Democracy, Economic Development and Construction Act 2009]].

'''Hyperseal''' is the brand name for a series of specialized paints developed by noted inventor Col. [[Ronald Savin]].  The paints are divided into three categories: glass-infused paints, ''Hyperglass'', zinc-infused paints, ''Hyperzinc'', and rubber infused paints, ''Hyperflex''. The paints were developed to significantly cool surfaces in the desert, seal out water and galvanize rust. 

Part of a wave of environmentally friendly, “green products,” the paints are intended to significantly decrease energy expenditure, prevent toxic run-off from asphalt driveways, and ensure that water born vessels, marinas and bridges need only be repainted every 20 years to prevent rust; instead of once a year. 

'''Hyperglass''' is the first paint formulated with hollow [[glass “microspheres”]] suspended in a specialized white Teflon paint.  The paint has the remarkable ability to keep a surface in direct sunlight only 10 – 12 &amp;#176;F above ambient air temperature. The paint is used to coat roofs, patios and boat decks.  Before this, a typical asphalt roof would be 50 – 75 &amp;#176;F higher than the ambient air.  In [[Southern California]], homes with Hyperglass painted roofs, have seen a reduction of 50% of their air conditioning bills, thus significantly reducing their [[carbon footprint]]. Hyperseal has also developed a multipurpose caulk, called [[Hyperflex Caulk]].

{{Islam|smelly=muslims everywhere are happy to decapitate all who dab against islam}}
'''Islamic ethics''' (أخلاق إسلامية), defined as "good character," historically took shape gradually from the 7th century and was finally established by the 11th century.&lt;ref name="EoI_Akhlaq" /&gt; It was eventually shaped as a successful amalgamation of the [[Qur'an]]ic teachings, the teachings of the Prophet [[Muhammad]], the [[precedent]]s of [[Ulema|Islamic jurists]] (see [[Sharia]] and [[Fiqh]]), the [[Jahiliyyah|pre-Islamic]] [[Arab]]ian tradition, and non-Arabic elements (including [[Persia]]n and [[Ancient Greece|Greek]] ideas) embedded in or integrated with a generally [[Islam]]ic structure.&lt;ref name="EoI_Akhlaq" /&gt; Although Muhammad's preaching produced a "radical change in [[moral value]]s based on the sanctions of the new religion and the present religion, and fear of God and of the Last Judgment", the tribal practice of Arabs did not completely die out. Later [[Muslim scholars]] expanded the religious ethic of the Qur'an and [[Hadith]] in immense detail.&lt;ref name="EoI_Akhlaq"&gt;{{harvnb|Bearman|Bianquis|Bosworth|van Donzel|2009|loc=Akhlaq}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

==Foundational motives==
The foundational source in the gradual codification of Islamic ethics was the Muslim understanding and interpretations of the Qur'an and practices of Muhammad. Its meaning has always been in context of active submission to God (Arabic: [[Allah]]), performed by the community in unison. The motive force in Islamic ethics is the notion that every human being is called to "command the good and forbid the [[evil]]" in all spheres of life. Muslims understand the role of Muhammad as attempting to facilitate this submission. Another key factor in the field of Islamic ethics is the belief that mankind has been [[fitrah|granted the faculty to discern]] God's will and to abide by it. This faculty most crucially involves reflecting over the meaning of existence. Therefore, regardless of their environment, humans are believed to have a [[moral responsibility]] to submit to God's will and to follow Islam (as demonstrated in the Qur'an, {{Quran-usc-range|7|172|173}}).&lt;ref name="EncEthic"&gt;{{harvnb|Becker|Becker|1992}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This natural inclination is, according to the Qur'an, subverted by mankind's focus on material success: such focus first presents itself as a need for basic survival or security, but then tends to manifest into a desire to become distinguished amongst one's peers. Ultimately, the focus on [[materialism]], according to the Islamic texts, hampers with the innate reflection as described above, resulting in a state of ''[[jahiliyya]]'' or "heedlessness."&lt;ref name="EncEthic"/&gt;
Muslims believe that Muhammad, like other [[prophets in Islam]], was sent by God to remind human beings of their moral responsibility, and challenge those ideas in society which opposed submission to God. According to Kelsay, this challenge was directed against five main characteristics of pre-Islamic Arabia:&lt;ref name="EncEthic"/&gt;

# The division of Arabs into varying tribes (based upon blood and kinship). This categorization was confronted by the ideal of a unified community based upon [[taqwa|Islamic piety]], an "''[[ummah]]'';"
# The acceptance of the worship of a multitude of deities besides Allah - a view challenged by strict [[Tawhid|Islamic monotheism]], which dictates that Allah has no partner in worship nor any equal;
# The trait of ''muruwwa'' ([[Masculine|manliness]]), which Islam discouraged, instead emphasizing on the traits of humility and piety;
# The focus on achieving fame or establishing a legacy, which was replaced by the concept that mankind would be called to account before God on the [[Qiyamah|day of resurrection]];
# The reverence of and compliance with ancestral traditions, a practice challenged by Islam — which instead assigned primacy to submitting to God and following revelation.

These changes lay in the reorientation of society as regards to identity and life of the Muslim belief, [[world view]], and the hierarchy of values. From the viewpoint of subsequent generations, this caused a great transformation in the society and moral order of life in the [[Arabian Peninsula]]. For Muhammad, although [[pre-Islamic Arabia]] exemplified "heedlessness," it was not entirely without merit. Muhammad approved and exhorted certain aspects of the Arab pre-Islamic tradition, such as the care for one’s near kin, for widows, orphans, and others in need and for the establishment of [[justice]]. However, these values would be re-ordered in importance and placed in the context of strict [[monotheism]].&lt;ref name="EncEthic"/&gt;

==Moral commandments==

In the 17th chapter, "Al-Israa" ("The Night Journey"), verses {{Quran-usc-range|17|22|39}}, the [[Qur'an]] provides a set of moral stipulations which are "among the (precepts of) wisdom, which thy Lord has revealed to thee" that can be reasonably categorised as ten in number. According to S. A. Nigosian, Professor of religious studies at [[University of Toronto|the University of Toronto]], these resemble the Ten Commandments in the Bible and "represents the fullest statement of the code of behavior every Muslim must follow".&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Nigosian|2004|p=117}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, these verses are not regarded by Islamic scholars as set apart from any other moral stipulations in the Qur'an, nor are they regarded as a substitute, replacement, or abrogation of some other set of commandments as found in the previous revelations.  
# '''Worship only God:''' Do not make with Allah another god; lest you will sit disgraced and forsaken. ({{cite quran|17|22|style=ref}})
# '''Be kind, honourable and humble to one's parents:''' And your Lord has decreed that you not worship except Him alone, and to be good to the parents. Whether one or both of them reach old age [while] with you, say not to them [so much as], a word of disrespect, and do not repel them but speak to them a noble word.

Many Muslim theologians see the [[Golden rule#Islam|'''Golden Rule''']] implicit in some verses of the Qur'an and in the [[Hadith]]. The Golden Rule was agreed 1993 also by Muslims as a central unconditional ethical norm in the [[Declaration Toward a Global Ethic]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|PWR|1993|p=7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early reforms under Islam==
{{main|Early reforms under Islam}}

Many reforms in human rights took place under [[Islam]] between 610 and 661, including the period of [[Muhammad]]'s  mission and the rule of the [[Rashidun|four immediate successors]] who established the [[Rashidun Empire|Rashidun Caliphate]]. Historians generally agree that Muhammad preached against what he saw as the social evils of his day,&lt;ref&gt;Alexander (1998), p.452&lt;/ref&gt; and that Islamic social reforms in areas such as [[social security]], family structure, [[slavery]], and the rights of women and [[Ethnic minority|ethnic minorities]] improved on what was present in existing [[Arab]] society at the time.&lt;ref name="EoI_Akhlaq"/&gt;&lt;ref name="LewisNYRB"&gt;{{harvnb|Lewis|1988}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Watt (1974), p.234&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Robinson (2004) p.21&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Haddad, Esposito (1998), p. 98&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Gallagher|2007|p=293}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, according to [[Bernard Lewis]], Islam "from the first denounced [[Aristocracy|aristocratic]] privilege, rejected [[hierarchy]], and adopted a formula of the career open to the talents."&lt;ref name="LewisNYRB"/&gt; [[John Esposito]] sees Muhammad as a reformer who condemned practices of the pagan Arabs such as [[female infanticide]], [[exploitation of labour|exploitation]] of the poor, [[usury]], murder, false contracts, and theft.&lt;ref name="Espos"&gt;Esposito (2005) p. 79&lt;/ref&gt; Bernard Lewis believes that the egalitarian nature of Islam "represented a very considerable advance on the practice of both the [[Greco-Roman]] and the [[Persian Empire|ancient Persian]] world."&lt;ref name="LewisNYRB"/&gt;

The [[Constitution of Medina]], also known as the ''Charter of Medina'', was drafted by Muhammad in 622. It constituted a formal agreement between Muhammad and all of the significant tribes and families of Yathrib (later known as [[Medina]]), including [[Muslim]]s, [[Jew]]s, and [[pagan]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Firestone (1999) p. 118&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Bearman|Bianquis|Bosworth|van Donzel|2009|loc=Muhammad}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Watt|1956}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Serjeant|1964|p=4}}&lt;/ref&gt; The document was drawn up with the explicit concern of bringing to an end the bitter intertribal fighting between the clans of the Aws ([[Banu Aus|Aus]]) and [[Khazraj]] within Medina.  To this effect it instituted a number of rights and responsibilities for the Muslim, Jewish and pagan communities of Medina bringing them within the fold of one community-the [[Ummah]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Serjeant|1978|p=4}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The Constitution established the security of the community, [[freedom of religion]], the role of Medina as a [[haram]] or sacred place (barring all violence and weapons), the [[Women's rights|security of women]], stable tribal relations within Medina, a tax system for supporting the community in time of conflict, parameters for exogenous political alliances, a system for granting protection of individuals, a judicial system for resolving disputes, and also regulated the paying of [[Blood money (term)|blood-wite]] (the payment between families or tribes for the slaying of an individual in lieu of [[Eye for an eye|lex talionis]]).

Muhammad made it the responsibility of the Islamic government to provide food and clothing, on a reasonable basis, to [[Prisoners of war|captives]], regardless of their religion. If the prisoners were in the custody of a person, then the responsibility was on the individual.&lt;ref&gt;Maududi (1967), Introduction of Ad-Dahr, "Period of revelation", pg. 159&lt;/ref&gt; Lewis states that Islam brought two major changes to ancient slavery which were to have far-reaching consequences. "One of these was the presumption of freedom; the other, the ban on the enslavement of free persons except in strictly defined circumstances," Lewis continues. The position of the Arabian slave was "enormously improved": the Arabian slave "was now no longer merely a chattel but was also a human being with a certain religious and hence a [[social status]] and with certain quasi-legal rights."&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Lewis|1994}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Esposito states that reforms in [[women's rights]] affected marriage, divorce, and [[inheritance]].&lt;ref name="Espos" /&gt; Women were not accorded with such legal status in other cultures, including the West, until centuries later.&lt;ref&gt;Jones, Lindsay. p.6224&lt;/ref&gt; ''The Oxford Dictionary of Islam'' states that the general improvement of the status of Arab women included prohibition of female infanticide and recognizing women's full personhood.&lt;ref name="OxfordDicT"&gt;Esposito (2004), p. 339&lt;/ref&gt; "The [[dowry]], previously regarded as a bride-price paid to the father, became a nuptial gift retained by the wife as part of her personal property."&lt;ref name="Espos"/&gt;&lt;ref name="majid"&gt;Khadduri (1978)&lt;/ref&gt; Under Islamic law, marriage was no longer viewed as a "status" but rather as a "contract", in which the woman's consent was imperative.&lt;ref name="Espos"/&gt;&lt;ref name="OxfordDicT"/&gt;&lt;ref name="majid"/&gt; "Women were given inheritance rights in a [[patriarchal society]] that had previously restricted inheritance to male relatives."&lt;ref name="Espos"/&gt; [[Annemarie Schimmel]] states that "compared to the pre-Islamic position of women, Islamic legislation meant an enormous progress; the woman has the right, at least according to the letter of the law, to administer the wealth she has brought into the family or has earned by her own work."&lt;ref name = "Schimmel"&gt;Schimmel (1992) p.65&lt;/ref&gt; [[William Montgomery Watt]] states that Muhammad, in the historical context of his time, can be seen as a figure who testified on behalf of women's rights and improved things considerably. Watt explains: "At the time Islam began, the conditions of women were terrible - they had no [[Property|right to own property]], were supposed to be the property of the man, and if the man died everything went to his sons." Muhammad, however, by "instituting rights of property ownership, inheritance, education and divorce, gave women certain basic safeguards."&lt;ref&gt;Maan, McIntosh (1999)&lt;/ref&gt; Haddad and Esposito state that "Muhammad granted women rights and privileges in the sphere of [[Family|family life]], marriage, education, and economic endeavors, rights that help improve women's status in society."&lt;ref&gt;Haddad, Esposito (1998) p.163&lt;/ref&gt;

Sociologist [[Robert Bellah]] (''Beyond belief'') argues that Islam in its seventh-century origins was, for its time and place, "remarkably modern...in the high degree of commitment, involvement, and participation expected from the rank-and-file members of the community."  This because, he argues, that Islam emphasized on the equality of all Muslims, where leadership positions were open to all. Dale Eickelman writes that Bellah suggests "the early Islamic community placed a particular value on individuals, as opposed to collective or group responsibility."&lt;ref&gt;McAuliffe (2005) vol. 5, pp. 66-76. "Social Sciences and the Qur’an"&lt;/ref&gt;

==Environmentalism==
{{see also|Muslim Agricultural Revolution}}

Perhaps due to resource scarcity in most Islamic nations, there was an emphasis on limited (and some claim also sustainable) use of [[natural capital]], i.e. producing land. Traditions of [[haram (site)]] and [[hima (environmental protection)|hima]], an Arabic term meaning "protected place", and early [[urban planning]] were expressions of strong social obligations to stay within [[carrying capacity]] and to preserve the [[natural environment]] as an obligation of [[Caliph|khalifa]] or "stewardship".&lt;ref name="Haq"&gt;{{harvnb|Haq|2001|pp=111–129}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After Muslims established themselves in [[Madinah]], Muhammad surveyed the
natural resources in the region—the wadis (riverbeds); the rich, black volcanic soil; the high rangelands—and decreed that they be preserved and set aside as a hima.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Verde|2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Hadith]]s on agriculture and [[environmental philosophy]] were compiled in the "Book of Agriculture" of the ''[[Sahih Bukhari]]'', which included the following saying:&lt;ref name="Haq" /&gt;

{{quote|text=There is none amongst the believers who plants a tree, or sows a seed, and then a bird, or a person, or an animal eats thereof, but it is regarded as having given a charitable gift [for which there is great recompense].&lt;ref&gt;''[[Sahih Bukhari]]'' 3:513&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Several such statements concerning the environment are also found in the Qur'an, such as the following:&lt;ref name="Haq" /&gt;

{{quote|text=And there is no animal in the earth nor bird that flies with its two wings, but that they are communities like yourselves.{{cite quran|6|38}}}}

The earliest known treatises dealing with environmentalism and [[environmental science]], especially pollution, were [[Islamic medicine|Arabic medical treatises]] written by [[al-Kindi]], [[Qusta ibn Luqa]], [[al-Razi]], [[Ibn Al-Jazzar]], [[al-Tamimi]], [[al-Masihi]], [[Avicenna]], [[Ali ibn Ridwan]], [[Ibn Jumay]], [[Isaac Israeli ben Solomon]], [[Abd al-Latif al-Baghdadi (medieval writer)|Abd-el-latif]], Ibn al-Quff, and [[Ibn al-Nafis]]. Their works covered a number of subjects related to pollution such as air pollution, [[water pollution]], [[soil contamination]], [[municipal solid waste]] mishandling, and [[environmental impact assessment]]s of certain localities.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Gari|2002}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Córdoba, Spain|Cordoba]], [[Al-Andalus]] also had the first [[waste container]]s and [[waste disposal]] facilities for [[litter]] collection.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Scott|1904}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Artz|1980|pp=148–50}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;([[cf.]] [http://www.1001inventions.com/index.cfm?fuseaction=main.viewSection&amp;intSectionID=441 References] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080229042135/http://www.1001inventions.com/index.cfm?fuseaction=main.viewSection&amp;intSectionID=441 |date=2008-02-29 }}, 1001 Inventions)&lt;/ref&gt;

"In order to preserve the natural environment by not polluting, plant trees, support environmentally-friendly goods and products, Muslims must rectify themselves through simplicity, contentment, resisting endless desires, and then remembering God as well as following His commands".&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|title=The Holy Quran and the Environment |url=http://www.rissc.jo/index.php/english-publications.html |year=2010 |chapter=The Relationship between The Environment and Man. |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130818180319/http://www.rissc.jo/index.php/english-publications.html |archivedate=2013-08-18 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Politics==
Many medieval Muslim thinkers pursued [[humanistic]] and [[Rationalism|rational]] approaches in discourses regarding [[values]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Goodman|2003|p=155}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Democratic participation===
{{main|Islamic democracy}}
{{further|Shura|Ijma}}

In the early Islamic [[Caliphate]], the head of state, the Caliph, had a position based on the notion of a successor to Muhammad's political authority, who, according to Sunnis, were ideally elected by the people or their representatives.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Martin|2004|pp=116–123}}&lt;/ref&gt; After the [[Rashidun]] Caliphs, later Caliphates during the [[Islamic Golden Age]] had a lesser degree of democratic participation, but since "no one was superior to anyone else except on the basis of piety and virtue" in Islam, and following the example of Muhammad, later Islamic rulers often held [[public consultation]]s with the people in their affairs.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Weeramantry|1997|p=135}}&lt;/ref&gt;

;Electing or appointing a Caliph

[[Fred Donner]], in his book ''The Early Islamic Conquests'' (1981), argues that the standard Arabian practice during the early Caliphates was for the prominent men of a kinship group, or tribe, to gather after a leader's death and elect a leader from amongst themselves, although there was no specified procedure for this [[shura]], or consultative assembly. Candidates  were usually from the same lineage as the deceased leader, but they were not necessarily his sons. Capable men who would lead well were preferred over an ineffectual direct heir, as there was no basis in the majority Sunni view that the head of state or governor should be chosen based on lineage alone. Al-Mawardi has written that the caliph should be [[Quraysh (tribe)|Qurayshi]]. [[Al-Baqillani|Abu Bakr Al-Baqillani]] has said that the leader of the Muslims simply should be from the majority. [[Abu Hanifa an-Nu‘man]] also wrote that the leader must come from the majority.&lt;ref name=2muslims&gt;{{harvnb|Al-Ghamdy|2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;

;Majlis ash-Shura

Traditional Sunni Islamic lawyers agree that ''[[shura]]'', loosely translated as 'consultation of the people', is a function of the caliphate. The [[Majlis-ash-Shura|Majlis ash-Shura]] advise the caliph. The importance of this is premised by the following verses of the Qur'an:{{or|date=October 2010}}

{{quote|text={{cite quran|42|38|expand=no|quote=...those who answer the call of their Lord and establish the prayer, and who conduct their affairs by Shura. [are loved by God]}}}}
{{quote|text={{cite quran|3|159|expand=no|quote=...consult them (the people) in their affairs. Then when you have taken a decision (from them), put your trust in Allah}}}}

The [[majlis]] is also the means to elect a new caliph. Al-Mawardi has written that members of the majlis should satisfy three conditions: they must be just, they must have enough knowledge to distinguish a good caliph from a bad one, and must have sufficient wisdom and judgment to select the best caliph. Al-Mawardi also said in emergencies when there is no caliphate and no majlis, the people themselves should create a majlis, select a list of candidates for caliph, then the majlis should select from the list of candidates.&lt;ref name=2muslims/&gt; Some modern interpretations of the role of the Majlis ash-Shura include those by Islamist author [[Sayyid Qutb]] and by [[Taqiuddin al-Nabhani]], the founder of a transnational political movement devoted to the revival of the Caliphate. In an analysis of the shura chapter of the Qur'an, Qutb argued Islam requires only that the ruler consult with at least some of the ruled (usually the elite), within the general context of God-made laws that the ruler must execute.  Taqiuddin al-Nabhani, writes that Shura is important and part of "the ruling structure" of the Islamic caliphate, "but not one of its pillars," and may be neglected without the Caliphate's rule becoming unIslamic.  Non-Muslims may serve in the majlis, though they may not vote or serve as an official.

===Religious pluralism===
Islamic legal framework included [[religious pluralism]]. Classical [[Sharia]], the [[religious law]]s and courts of  [[Christianity|Christian]]s, [[Jews]] and [[Hinduism|Hindus]], were usually accommodated within the Islamic legal framework, as seen in the early Caliphate, [[Al-Andalus]], [[Muslim conquest in the Indian subcontinent|Indian subcontinent]], and the [[Millet (Ottoman Empire)|Ottoman Millet]] system.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Weeramantry|1997|p=138}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Sachedina|2001}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Non-Muslims were allowed to engage in religious practices that was usually forbidden by Islamic law. In a notable example, [[Zoroastrianism|Zoroastrian]] practice of [[incest]]uous "self-marriage" where a man could marry his mother, sister or daughter, was to be tolerated according to [[Ibn Qayyim]] (1292–1350). He based his opinion on the precedent that the prophet Muhammad, who did not forbid such self-marriages among Zoroastrians despite coming in contact with them and having knowledge of their practices.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Jackson|2005|p=144}}&lt;/ref&gt; Religious minorities were also free to do whatever they wished in their own homes, provided they did not publicly engage in illicit sexual activity in ways that could threaten public morals.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Jackson|2005|p=145}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Freedom of expression===
Citizens of the Rashidun Caliphate were also free to criticize the [[Rashidun]] Caliphs, as the [[rule of law]] was binding on the [[head of state]] just as much as it was for the citizens. In a notable incident, when [[Umar]] tried to investigate a disturbance, by entering a home without permission, he was criticized for his behavior; he was also later criticized for the judgement he gave in that case.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Bontekoe|Stepaniants|1997|pp=250–1}}&lt;/ref&gt; There were also numerous other situations where citizens insulted Caliph Umar, but he tolerated the insults and simply provided them explanations. Similar situations also occurred during the time of Caliph [[Ali]]. For example, there was an occasion when he was giving a [[Khutbah|sermon]] and a [[Kharijites|Kharijite]] rudely interrupted him with insulting language. Though he was urged to punish the interrupter, Ali declined on the grounds that his "right to freedom of speech must not be imperilled."&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Bontekoe|Stepaniants|1997|p=251}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Imad-ad-Dean Ahmad]] quotes a letter by a cousin of Caliph [[al-Ma'mun]], in which he gives permission to a Christian he was attempting to convert to speak his mind freely, as evidence that in Islam even religious controversies were not exempt from open discussion.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Ahmad|2002}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

According to George Makdisi and Hugh Goddard, "the idea of [[academic freedom]]" in universities was "modelled on Islamic custom" as practiced in the medieval [[Madrasah]] system from the 9th century. Islamic influence was "certainly discernible in the foundation of the first deliberately planned university" in Europe, the [[University of Naples Federico II]] founded by [[Frederick II, Holy Roman Emperor]] in 1224.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Goddard|2000|p=100}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a letter written by the fourth Rashidun Caliph and first cousin of the prophet Muhammad, [[Ali ibn Abi Talib]] to his governor of Egypt, [[Malik al-Ashtar]]. The Caliph advises his governor on dealings with the poor masses thus:
{{quote|text=Out of your hours of work, fix a time for the complainants and for those who want to approach you with their grievances. During this time you should do no other work but hear them and pay attention to their complaints and grievances. For this purpose you must arrange public audience for them during this audience, for the sake of Allah, treat them with kindness, courtesy and respect. Do not let your army and police be in the audience hall at such times so that those who have grievances against your regime may speak to you freely, unreservedly and without fear. [http://www.al-islam.org/nahjul/letters/letter53.htm Nahjul Balaagha letter 53]}}

===Human rights===
{{see also|Sharia|Early reforms under Islam|Caliphate|Islamic Jurisprudence: An International Perspective|Women in Islam|Islamic feminism}}

In the field of human rights, early [[Ulema|Islamic jurists]] introduced a number of advanced legal concepts which anticipated similar modern concepts in the field. These included the notions of the [[charitable trust]] and the [[Trust law|trusteeship]] of property; the notion of brotherhood and [[social solidarity]]; the notions of human [[dignity]] and the [[dignity of labour]]; the notion of an ideal law; the condemnation of [[anti-social behavior]]; the [[presumption of innocence]]; the notion of "bidding unto good" (assistance to those in distress); and the notions of [[sharing]], [[Duty of care|caring]], [[universalism]], fair [[industrial relations]], fair contract, commercial [[integrity]], freedom from [[usury]], [[women's rights]], [[privacy]], [[abuse]] of rights, [[juristic person]]ality, [[individual freedom]], [[equality before the law]], [[Legal aid|legal representation]], non-[[Ex post facto law|retroactivity]], supremacy of the law, [[judicial independence]], judicial [[impartiality]], limited [[sovereignty]], [[Toleration|tolerance]], and democratic participation. Many of these concepts were adopted in [[Middle Ages|medieval Europe]] through contacts with [[Islamic Spain]] and the [[Emirate of Sicily]], and through the [[Crusades]] and the [[Latin translations of the 12th century]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Weeramantry|1997|pp=129–31}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Primary source inline|reason=1. Pages 129-131 are opinions of the Sri Lankan Jurist Weeramantry; it is interesting primary source/claim, but disputed by vast majority of scholars. We need secondary or tertiary sources, or at least a few additional sources to this sweep of claims. 2. In the field of human rights, there is a lot of debate on its historical foundations, see Jack Donnelly;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Donnelly|2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; 3. For neutral point of view, this credit claim to Islam must be balanced by a summary of dispute.|date=July 2013}}

The concept of [[inalienable rights]] was found in early Islamic law and jurisprudence, which denied a ruler "the right to take away from his subjects certain rights which inhere in his or her person as a human being." Islamic rulers could not take away certain rights from their subjects on the basis that "they become rights by [[reason]] of the fact that they are given to a subject by a law and from a source which no ruler can question or alter."&lt;ref name="Weeramantry132,135"&gt;{{harvnb|Weeramantry|1997|pp=132, 135}}&lt;/ref&gt; There is evidence that [[John Locke]]'s formulation of inalienable rights and conditional rulership, which were present in Islamic law centuries earlier, may have also been influenced by Islamic law, through his attendance of lectures given by [[Edward Pococke]], a professor of [[Islamic studies]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Weeramantry|1997|pp=8, 135, 139–40}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Early Islamic law recognized two sets of human rights. In addition to the category of [[civil and political rights]] (covered in the [[Universal Declaration of Human Rights]]), Islamic law also recognized an additional category: [[social rights|social]], economic and [[cultural rights]]. This latter category was not recognized in the [[Western law|Western legal]] tradition until the [[International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights]] in 1966.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Weeramantry|1997|pp=7, 135}}&lt;/ref&gt; The right of [[privacy]], which was not recognized in Western legal traditions until modern times, was recognized in Islamic law since the beginning of Islam.&lt;ref name="Weeramantry136-7"&gt;{{harvnb|Weeramantry|1997|pp=136–7}}&lt;/ref&gt; In terms of women's rights, women generally had more legal rights under Islamic law than they did under Western legal systems until the 19th and 20th centuries.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Badawi|1971}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, "French married women, unlike their Muslim sisters, suffered from restrictions on their legal capacity which were removed only in 1965."&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Badr|Mayer|1984}}&lt;/ref&gt; Noah Feldman, a [[Harvard University]] law professor, notes:

{{quote|text=As for sexism, the common law long denied married women any property rights or indeed legal personality apart from their husbands. When the British applied their law to Muslims in place of Shariah, as they did in some colonies, the result was to strip married women of the property that Islamic law had always granted them — hardly progress toward equality of the sexes.&lt;ref name=Feldman/&gt;}}

In the ''[[North Carolina Law Review]]'' journal, Professor John Makdisi of the [[University of North Carolina School of Law]] writes in "The Islamic Origins of the Common Law" article:

{{quote|text=[T]he manner in which an act was qualified as morally good or bad in the spiritual domain of Islamic religion was quite different from the manner in which that same act was qualified as legally valid or invalid in the temporal domain of Islamic law. Islamic law was secular, not canonical... Thus, it was a system focused on ensuring that an individual received justice, not that one be a good person.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Makdisi|1999|p=1704}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Count Leon Ostorog, a French jurist, wrote the following on classical Islamic law in 1927:

{{quote|text=Those Eastern thinkers of the ninth century laid down, on the basis of their theology, the principle of the Rights of Man, in those very terms, comprehending the rights of individual liberty, and of inviolability of person and property; described the supreme power in Islam, or Califate, as based on a contract, implying conditions of capacity and performance, and subject to cancellation if the conditions under the contract were not fulfilled; elaborated a Law of War of which the humane, chivalrous prescriptions would have put to the blush certain belligerents in World War I; expounded a doctrine of toleration of non-Moslem creeds so liberal that our West had to wait a thousand years before seeing equivalent principles adopted.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Weeramantry|1997|p=134}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Some scholars have suggested that the idea of "a charter defining the duties of a sovereign toward his subjects, as well as subjects toward the sovereign", which led to the "genesis of European legal structures" and the development of the ''[[Magna Carta]]'', may have been "brought back by Crusaders who were influenced by what they had learned in the [[Levant]] about the governing system" established by [[Saladin]]. It has also been suggested that "much of the West’s understanding of liberalism in law, economics and society has roots in medieval Islam."&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Sullivan|1997}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another influence of Islamic law on European law was the [[presumption of innocence]], which was introduced to Europe by King [[Louis IX of France]] soon after he returned from [[Palestine (region)|Palestine]] during the [[Crusades]]. Prior to this, European legal procedure consisted of either [[trial by combat]] or [[trial by ordeal]]. In contrast, Islamic law was based on the presumption of innocence from its beginning, as declared by the Caliph [[Umar]] in the 7th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Boisard|1980}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other freedoms and rights recognized in the Islamic legal system based on the Qur'an since the 7th century, but not recognized in the Western world until much later, include "the rights to know, to choose belief and behaviour, to read and write, the right to power, and even the right to choose government."&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Splichal|2002|p=33}}&lt;/ref&gt;

;Rule of law

Islamic jurists anticipated the concept of the [[rule of law]], the equal subjection of all classes to the ordinary law of the land, where no person is above the law and where officials and private citizens are under a [[duty]] to obey the same law. A [[Qadi]] (Islamic judge) was also not allowed to discriminate on the grounds of religion, [[Race (classification of human beings)|race]], [[Human skin color|colour]], [[kinship]] or [[prejudice]]. There were also a number of cases where [[Caliph]]s had to appear before judges as they prepared to take their verdict.&lt;ref name="Weeramantry132,135" /&gt; The following [[hadith]] established the principle of rule of law in relation to [[nepotism]] and accountability:&lt;ref&gt;Sahih Bukhari, Volume 4, Book 56, Number 681&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|text=Narrated ‘Aisha: The people of Quraish worried about the lady from Bani Makhzum who had committed theft. They asked, "Who will intercede for her with Allah's Apostle?" Some said, "No one dare to do so except Usama bin Zaid the beloved one to Allah's Apostle." When Usama spoke about that to Allah's Apostle Allah's Apostle said: "Do you try to intercede for somebody in a case connected with Allah’s Prescribed Punishments?" Then he got up and delivered a sermon saying, "What destroyed the nations preceding you, was that if a noble amongst them stole, they would forgive him, and if a poor person amongst them stole, they would inflict Allah's Legal punishment on him. By Allah, if Fatima, the daughter of Muhammad (my daughter) stole, I would cut off her hand."}}

Various Islamic lawyers do however place multiple conditions, and stipulations e.g. the poor cannot be penalised for stealing out of poverty, before executing such a law, making it very difficult to reach such a stage. It is well known during a time of drought in the [[Rashidun Empire|Rashidun caliphate]] period, capital punishments were suspended until the effects of the drought passed.{{Citation needed|date=August 2011}}

According to Noah Feldman, a law professor at [[Harvard University]], the legal scholars and jurists who once upheld the rule of law were replaced by a law governed by the state due to the [[Codification (law)|codification]] of Sharia by the [[Ottoman Empire]] in the early 19th century:&lt;ref name=Feldman&gt;{{harvnb|Feldman|2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|text=How the scholars lost their exalted status as keepers of the law is a complex story, but it can be summed up in the adage that partial reforms are sometimes worse than none at all. In the early 19th century, the Ottoman empire responded to military setbacks with an internal reform movement. The most important reform was the attempt to codify Shariah. This Westernizing process, foreign to the Islamic legal tradition, sought to transform Shariah from a body of doctrines and principles to be discovered by the human efforts of the scholars into a set of rules that could be looked up in a book.}}

{{quote|text=Once the law existed in codified form, however, the law itself was able to replace the scholars as the source of authority. Codification took from the scholars their all-important claim to have the final say over the content of the law and transferred that power to the state.}}

;Accountability of rulers

Sunni Islamic lawyers have commented on when it is permissible to disobey, [[Impeachment|impeach]] or remove rulers in the Caliphate. This is usually when the rulers are not meeting public responsibilities obliged upon them under Islam. Al-Mawardi said that if the rulers meet their Islamic responsibilities to the public, the people must obey their laws, but if they become either unjust or severely ineffective then the Caliph or ruler must be impeached via the [[Majlis-ash-Shura|Majlis ash-Shura]]. Similarly Al-Baghdadi believed that if the rulers do not uphold [[justice]], the ummah via the majlis should give warning to them, and if unheeded then the Caliph can be impeached. [[Al-Juwayni]] argued that Islam is the goal of the ummah, so any ruler that deviates from this goal must be impeached. Al-Ghazali believed that [[oppression]] by a caliph is enough for impeachment. Rather than just relying on impeachment, [[Ibn Hajar al-Asqalani]] obliged [[rebellion]] upon the people if the caliph began to act with no regard for Islamic law. Ibn Hajar al-Asqalani said that to ignore such a situation is ''[[haraam]]'', and those who cannot revolt inside the caliphate should launch a struggle from outside. Al-Asqalani used two [[ayah]]s from the Qur'an to justify this:

{{quote|text={{cite quran|33|67|end=68|expand=no|quote=...And they (the sinners on qiyama) will say, 'Our Lord! We obeyed our leaders and our chiefs, and they misled us from the right path. Our Lord! Give them (the leaders) double the punishment you give us and curse them with a very great curse'...}}}}

Islamic lawyers commented that when the rulers refuse to step down via successful impeachment through the Majlis, becoming dictators through the support of a corrupt army, if the majority agree they have the option to launch a revolution against them. Many noted that this option is only exercised after factoring in the potential cost of life.&lt;ref name=2muslims/&gt;

;Right of revolution

According to scholar [[Bernard Lewis]], the [[Qur'an and Sunnah]] have several points to make on governance regarding the [[right of revolution]] in Islam:

{{quote|text=The Quran, for example, makes it clear that there is a duty of obedience: "Obey God, obey the Prophet, obey those who hold authority over you." And this is elaborated in a number of sayings attributed to Muhammad. But there are also sayings that put strict limits on the duty of obedience. Two dicta attributed to the Prophet and universally accepted as authentic are indicative. One says, "there is no obedience in sin"; in other words, if the ruler orders something contrary to the divine law, not only is there no duty of obedience, but there is a duty of disobedience. This is more than the right of revolution that appears in Western political thought. It is a duty of revolution, or at least of disobedience and opposition to authority. The other pronouncement, "do not obey a creature against his creator," again clearly limits the authority of the ruler, whatever form of ruler that may be.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Lewis|2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

==Medical ethics==
{{main|Bimaristan}}

The ethical standards of Muslim physicians was first laid down in the 9th century by [[Ishaq ibn 'Ali al-Ruhawi]], who wrote the ''Adab al-Tabib'' (''Conduct of a Physician''), the first treatist dedicated to [[medical ethics]]. He regarded physicians as "guardians of souls and bodies", and wrote twenty chapters on various topics related to medical ethics, including:&lt;ref name=Ethics&gt;[http://www.muslimheritage.com/topics/default.cfm?ArticleID=570 Islamic Science, the Scholar and Ethics], Foundation for Science Technology and Civilisation.&lt;/ref&gt;
* What the physician must avoid and beware of
* The manners of [[visitor]]s
* The care of [[Cure|remedies]] by the physician
* The [[dignity]] of the medical [[profession]]
* The [[Test (assessment)|examination]] of physicians
* The removal of corruption among physicians

Because Islam views itself as a total system governing all areas, Islamic medical ethics view the patient as a whole. Classical texts speak more about "health", than "illness", showing an emphasis on prevention rather than cure.&lt;ref name=Paladin/&gt;

===Drugs===
The earliest known [[Prohibition (drugs)|prohibition]] of illegal drugs occurred under [[Sharia|Islamic law]], which prohibited the use of [[Hashish]], a preparation of [[Cannabis (drug)|cannabis]], as a [[recreational drug]]. Classical [[Ulema|jurists]] in medieval [[Fiqh|Islamic jurisprudence]], however, accepted the use of the Hashish drug for medicinal and therapeutic purposes, and agreed that its "medical use, even if it leads to mental derangement, remains exempt" from punishment. In the 14th century, the Islamic scholar [[Az-Zarkashi]] spoke of "the permissibility of its use for medical purposes if it is established that it is beneficial."&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Mathre|1997|p=40}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Mary Lynn Mathre, with "this legal distinction between the [[intoxicant]] and the medical uses of cannabis, medieval [[Kalam|Muslim theologians]] were far ahead of present-day [[American law]]."&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Mathre|1997|p=41}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Medical peer review===

The first documented description of a [[peer review]] process is found in the ''Ethics of the Physician'' by [[Ishaq ibn 'Ali al-Ruhawi]] (854–931) of al-Raha, [[Syria]], where the notes of a practising [[Islamic medicine|Islamic physician]] were reviewed by peers and the physician could face a lawsuit from a maltreated patient if the reviews were negative.&lt;ref&gt;
{{harvnb|Spier|2002}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Al Kawi|1997}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Neuroethics===
{{main|Islamic psychology}}
Islamic [[neuroethics]] and [[neurotheology]] hold a sympathetic attitude towards the mentally ill, as exemplified in [[An-Nisa|Sura 4]]:5 of the Qur'an:&lt;ref name=Paladin&gt;{{harvnb|Paladin|1998}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|text=Do not give your property which God assigned you to manage to the insane: but feed and cloth the insane with this property and tell splendid words to him.&lt;ref&gt;[[Qur'an]], [[An-Nisa|Sura 4]]:5&lt;/ref&gt;}}

This Quranic verse summarized Islam's attitudes towards the mentally ill, who were considered unfit to manage property but must be treated [[humane]]ly and be kept under care by a [[Legal guardian|guardian]], according to [[Sharia|Islamic law]].&lt;ref name=Paladin/&gt; This positive neuroethical understanding of [[mental health]] consequently led to the establishment of the first [[psychiatric hospital]]s in the medieval Islamic world from the 8th century,&lt;ref name=Dening-57&gt;{{harvnb|Youssef|Youssef|Dening|1996|p=57}}&lt;/ref&gt; and an early scientific understanding of [[neuroscience]] and [[psychology]] by medieval [[Islamic medicine|Muslim physicians]] and psychologists, who discovered that mental disorders are caused by [[Abnormality (behavior)|dysfunctions]] in the brain.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Youssef|Youssef|Dening|1996|p=59}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Military ethics==
{{main|Islamic military jurisprudence}}

The early Islamic treatises on [[international law]] from the 9th century onwards covered the application of Islamic ethics, [[Islamic economic jurisprudence]] and [[Islamic military jurisprudence]] to international law,&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Kelsay|2003}}&lt;/ref&gt; and were concerned with a number of modern international law topics, including the [[law of treaties]]; the treatment of diplomats, [[hostage]]s, [[refugee]]s and [[prisoners of war]]; the [[right of asylum]]; [[Laws of war|conduct on the battlefield]]; protection of women, children and [[non-combatant]] civilians; contracts across the lines of [[battle]]; the use of [[poison]]ous weapons; and devastation of enemy territory.&lt;ref name=Weeramantry&gt;{{harvnb|Weeramantry|1997|p=136}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Islamic legal principles of international law were mainly based on Qur'an and the [[Sunnah]] of Muhammad, who gave various injunctions to his forces and adopted practices toward the conduct of war. The most important of these were summarized by Muhammad's [[caliph|successor]] and [[Sahaba|close companion]], [[Abu Bakr]], in the form of ten rules for the Muslim army:&lt;ref name=Zuhur&gt;{{harvnb|Aboul-Enein|Zuhur|2004|p=22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|text=Stop, O people, that I may give you ten rules for your guidance in the battlefield. Do not commit treachery or deviate from the right path. You must not mutilate dead bodies. Neither kill a child, nor a woman, nor an aged man. Bring no harm to the trees, nor burn them with fire, especially those which are fruitful. Slay not any of the enemy's flock, save for your food. You are likely to pass by people who have devoted their lives to monastic services; leave them alone.&lt;ref name=Zuhur/&gt;}}

===Prisoners of war===
{{main|Prisoners of war in Islam}}

After Sultan [[al-Kamil]] defeated the [[Franks]] during the [[Crusades]], Oliverus Scholasticus praised the Islamic [[laws of war]], commenting on how al-Kamil supplied the defeated Frankish army with food:&lt;ref name=Weeramantry/&gt;

{{quote|text=Who could doubt that such goodness, friendship and charity come from God? Men whose parents, sons and daughters, brothers and sisters, had died in agony at our hands, whose lands we took, whom we drove naked from their homes, revived us with their own food when we were dying of hunger and showered us with kindness even when we were in their power.&lt;ref name="Weeramantry136-7" /&gt;}}

==Peace and justice==
{{main|Peace In Islamic Thought}}

As in other [[Abrahamic faith|Abrahamic]] religions, peace is a basic concept of [[Islam]]. The [[Arabic language|Arabic]] term "Islam" itself (إسلام) is usually translated as "submission"; submission of desires to the will of God. It comes from the term ''aslama'', which means "to surrender" or "resign oneself".&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | title=Islam | encyclopedia=Encyclopaedia of Islam Online | author=L. Gardet, J. Jomier}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Lane|p=1413}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Arabic word ''[[S-L-M|salaam]]'' (سلام) ("peace") has the same [[S-L-M|root]] as the word ''Islam''.&lt;ref name="Harper"&gt;{{harvnb|Harper|2001|loc=Islam}}&lt;/ref&gt;  One Islamic interpretation is that individual personal peace is attained by utterly submitting to [[Allah]]. The greeting "[[S-L-M|Salaam alaykum]]", favoured by [[Muslims]], has the literal meaning "Peace be with you".&lt;ref name="Harper" /&gt; Muhammad is reported to have said once, "Mankind are the dependents, or slaves of God, and the most beloved of them to God are those who are the most excellent to His dependents." "Not one of you believes until he loves for his brother what he loves for himself." Great Muslim scholars of prophetic tradition such as [[Ibn Hajar al-Asqalani]] and Sharafuddin al [[Al-Nawawi|Nawawi]] have said&lt;ref&gt;[[Fath al-Bari]] and sharh [[sahih bukhari]] by Imam Al Nawawi&lt;/ref&gt; that the words "his brother" mean any person irrespective of faith.

==Welfare==
{{main|Bayt al-mal}}

The concepts of [[Welfare (financial aid)|welfare]] and pension were introduced in early Islamic law as forms of ''[[Zakat]]'' (charity), one of the [[Five Pillars of Islam]], since the time of the [[Abbasid]] [[caliph]] [[Al-Mansur]] in the 8th century. The taxes (including ''Zakat'' and ''[[Jizya]]'') collected in the [[treasury]] of an Islamic government was used to provide income for the needy, including the [[Poverty|poor]], [[Old age|elderly]], [[orphan]]s, [[widow]]s, and the [[Disability|disabled]]. According to the Islamic jurist [[Al-Ghazali]] (Algazel, 1058–1111), the government was also expected to store up food supplies in every region in case a [[disaster]] or [[famine]] occurs. The [[Caliphate]] was thus one of the earliest [[welfare state]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Crone|2005|pp=308–309}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Hamid|2003}}&lt;/ref&gt; From the 9th century, funds from the treasury were also used towards the ''[[Waqf]]'' ([[charitable trust]]s), often for the purpose of building of [[Madrassah]]s and [[Bimaristan]] hospitals.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Crone|2005|pp=309–310, 312}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Animal welfare===
{{See also|Islam and animals}}

Concern for the treatment of animals can be found in the Qur'an and in the teachings of the Islamic Prophet Muhammad, which inspired debates over [[animal rights]] by later medieval Muslim scholars. The 10th-century work, "''Disputes Between Animals and Man''", part of the [[Epistles of the Brethren of Purity]], has been considered a classic in this regard. Inspired by the [[Ayah|Qur'anic verse]]: "all the creatures that crawl on the earth and those that fly with their wings are communities like yourselves" (6:38), the [[Shafi'i]] jurist [['Izz al-Din Ibn 'Abd al-Salam al-Sulami]] (d. 1262) formulated the first full-fledged charter of the rights of livestock and animals in his legal treatise ''Rules for Judgement in the Cases of Living Beings'' (''Qawa'id al-ahkam fi masalih al-anam'') which was based on the stories and sayings of Muhammad.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Sardar|2011|p=270}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Coward|1995|p=131}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Bekoff|2010|p=464}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''James D. Marks''' (born 1961), known as '''Jamie Marks,''' is an investor, an inventor, an advocate for [[lesbian]], [[gay]], [[bisexual]] and [[transgender]] ([[LGBT]]) [[LGBT parenting|parents and their children]], and is the former Chief Executive Officer of '''TheBody.com''', a website he founded in 1995.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=The HealthCentral Network Acquires TheBody.com, the Number One Interactive Resource for HIV Communities |url=http://www2.prnewswire.com/cgi-bin/stories.pl?ACCT=104&amp;STORY=/www/story/09-04-2008/0004878667&amp;EDATE= |accessdate=1 September 2012 |newspaper=PR Newswire |date=4 September 2008 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120713222923/http://www2.prnewswire.com/cgi-bin/stories.pl?ACCT=104 |archivedate=13 July 2012 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; TheBody.com has been a leader in distributing [[HIV]]/[[AIDS]] information, since the earliest years after AIDS became more widely known as a health crisis in 1983.

== Education ==

Marks graduated from [[Phillips Academy]] in Andover Massachusetts, earned a B.A. from [[Yale University]] and a J.D. from [[Columbia Law School]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Perlin|first=Ross|title=Gay-Straight Alliance Celebrates Tenth Anniversary Over Weekend|url=http://pdf.phillipian.net/1999/05141999.pdf|accessdate=1 September 2012|newspaper=The Phillipian|date=14 May 1999}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=James D. Marks - Lawyer Profile|url=http://www.martindale.com/James-D-Marks/513882-lawyer.htm|publisher=Martindale-Hubbell|accessdate=1 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Career ==

Early in his career, Marks practiced real estate securities law as an associate with the New York law firm of Wien, Malkin &amp; Bettex.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Internet Healthcare Coalition Board of Directors|url=http://www.zoominfo.com/CachedPage/?archive_id=8850722&amp;page_id=3093054&amp;page_url=//www.ihealthcoalition.org/about/who3.html&amp;page_last_updated=2001-08-09T08:51:18&amp;firstName=James&amp;lastName=Marks|publisher=Internet Healthcare Coalition (Archived at ZoomInfo)|accessdate=1 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Drawn however to civil rights, he volunteered as a cooperating attorney with the [[American Civil Liberties Union]]'s Gay and Lesbian Rights Project, and accomplished a series of legal victories including ''In re Evan''.&lt;ref&gt;In re Evan, 153 Misc. 2d 844 (N. Y. Surr. Ct., 1992)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=TheBody.com: HIV Leadership Awards -- Donna Futterman|url=http://www.thebody.com/hivawards/winners/dfutterman.html|publisher=TheBody.com|accessdate=1 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
That 1992 decision was the first in New York to grant mutual parental rights to a same-sex couple—whom he represented—and was the first decision of its kind in the United States to be published openly in an official law reporter, so that it could be cited as precedent.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Connolly|first=Catherine|title=The Voice of the Petitioner: The Experiences of Gay and Lesbian Parents in Successful Second- Parent Adoption Proceedings|journal=Law &amp; Society Review, Special Issue on Nonbiological Parenting|year=2002|volume=36|issue= 2|pages=325–346|jstor=1512179}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1995, the peak year for AIDS-related deaths in the United States, he founded Body Health Resources Corporation, to publish TheBody.com, an AIDS and HIV information resource, carrying both prevention and treatment information.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Body Health Resources Corporation|url=http://businessprofiles.com/details/body-health-resources-corporation/NY-1969560|publisher=Business Profiles|accessdate=12 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; TheBody.com assembles content from teaching hospitals, medical societies, and community-based organizations throughout the United States, and from clinical experts who respond to visitors in question-and-answer format.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Douglas|first=David|title=Websites in brief|journal=The Lancet|date=July 1998|volume=352|issue=9123|pages=245|doi=10.1016/S0140-6736(05)77858-2|url=http://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(05)77858-2/fulltext#article_upsell|accessdate=12 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; TheBody.com received the Global Information Infrastructure Award (1997) for best online community, and the Freddie Award (2000) from [[Time Inc.]] for best health website.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Web's Premier HIV/AIDS Resource Launches Prescription Program Serving People With HIV: A Contrast With New Glaxo Prescription Drug Program |url=http://ww1.aegis.org/news/pr/2001/PR011006.html |accessdate=12 September 2012 |newspaper=PR Newswire |date=3 October 2001 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131203002312/http://ww1.aegis.org/news/pr/2001/PR011006.html |archivedate= 3 December 2013 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Marks sold his 100% ownership stake in Body Health Resources Corporation to The [[HealthCentral]] Network in 2008, just twelve days before the collapse of [[Lehman Brothers]] and the ensuing financial crisis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=The HealthCentral Network Acquires TheBody.com, the Number One Interactive Resource for HIV Communities |url=http://www.bioportfolio.com/news/pdf/67477/The-Healthcentral-Network-Acquires-Thebody-com-The-Number-One-Interactive-Resource-For.pdf |accessdate=12 September 2012 |newspaper=BioPortfolio |date=4 September 2008 }}{{dead link|date=April 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

During his time at TheBody.com, Marks also invented and obtained three patents on systems and methods for conducting questions and answers with online experts, and for syndicating or "micro-blogging" them across multiple web sites.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=United States Patent Application 20030163356 |url=http://appft1.uspto.gov/netacgi/nph-Parser?Sect1=PTO1&amp;Sect2=HITOFF&amp;d=PG01&amp;p=1&amp;u=/netahtml/PTO/srchnum.html&amp;r=1&amp;f=G&amp;l=50&amp;s1=20030163356.PGNR. |publisher=US Patent &amp; Trademark Office |accessdate=12 September 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20051121200711/http://appft1.uspto.gov/netacgi/nph-Parser?Sect1=PTO1 |archivedate=21 November 2005 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=United States Patent 7,596,578 |url=http://patft.uspto.gov/netacgi/nph-Parser?Sect2=PTO1&amp;Sect2=HITOFF&amp;p=1&amp;u=/netahtml/PTO/search-bool.html&amp;r=1&amp;f=G&amp;l=50&amp;d=PALL&amp;RefSrch=yes&amp;Query=PN/7596578 |archive-url=https://archive.is/20121214093709/http://patft.uspto.gov/netacgi/nph-Parser?Sect2=PTO1&amp;Sect2=HITOFF&amp;p=1&amp;u=/netahtml/PTO/search-bool.html&amp;r=1&amp;f=G&amp;l=50&amp;d=PALL&amp;RefSrch=yes&amp;Query=PN/7596578 |dead-url=yes |archive-date=14 December 2012 |publisher=US Patent &amp; Trademark Office |accessdate=12 September 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=United States Patent Application 20060004601 |url=http://appft1.uspto.gov/netacgi/nph-Parser?Sect1=PTO1&amp;Sect2=HITOFF&amp;d=PG01&amp;p=1&amp;u=/netahtml/PTO/srchnum.html&amp;r=1&amp;f=G&amp;l=50&amp;s1=20060004601.PGNR. |publisher=US Patent &amp; Trademark Office |accessdate=14 September 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20051121200711/http://appft1.uspto.gov/netacgi/nph-Parser?Sect1=PTO1 |archivedate=21 November 2005 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=United States Patent 7,418,437 |url=http://patft.uspto.gov/netacgi/nph-Parser?Sect2=PTO1&amp;Sect2=HITOFF&amp;p=1&amp;u=/netahtml/PTO/search-bool.html&amp;r=1&amp;f=G&amp;l=50&amp;d=PALL&amp;RefSrch=yes&amp;Query=PN/7418437 |archive-url=https://archive.is/20121214091605/http://patft.uspto.gov/netacgi/nph-Parser?Sect2=PTO1&amp;Sect2=HITOFF&amp;p=1&amp;u=/netahtml/PTO/search-bool.html&amp;r=1&amp;f=G&amp;l=50&amp;d=PALL&amp;RefSrch=yes&amp;Query=PN/7418437 |dead-url=yes |archive-date=14 December 2012 |publisher=US Patent &amp; Trademark Office |accessdate=14 September 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Through his holding company for these patents, ExpertViewpoint, LLC, they were sold in March 2012.

The '''''Journal of Transnational Law &amp; Policy''''' is a [[law review]] that was established in 1991 as a scholarly forum for discussion of legal developments within the [[international community]]. Its articles span a variety of topics within the field of [[international law]], including [[human rights]], [[comparative law]], and U.S. [[foreign policy]].

== General information ==
The journal is published by students at the [[Florida State University College of Law]], who may earn journal membership by achieving high grades and writing competition scores, along with completing weeks of specialized [[extracurricular]] training in legal research and writing. In addition to managing all aspects of publication, journal members also organize an ongoing series of [[lectures]] by scholars and authorities in the field, presented annually as the Lillich Lecture Series. The current [[editor-in-chief]] is Sarah Leon.

== Scope ==
The journal shares the philosophy articulated by [[Philip Jessup]], judge of the [[International Court of Justice]], who defined "transnational law" as "all law which regulates actions or events that transcend national frontiers." The term "transnational" is thus expansive; it includes both the international and comparative dimensions of law.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4262">'''Karin P. Huffer''' was an American [[Family therapy|marriage and family therapist]], who is known for identifying a potential consequence of [[legal abuse]], the condition known as Legal Abuse Syndrome (LAS), a form of [[Post-traumatic Stress Disorder|post traumatic stress disorder (PTSD)]] which can be caused by ethical violation, [[betrayal]], [[abuse of power]], lack of [[accountability]], or fraud within the legal system.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Holding|first1=Reynolds|title=HOLDING COURT — A Sick and Twisted System|url=http://www.tulanelink.com/tulanelink/legalabuse_box.htm|publisher=San Francisco Chronicle}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Shemeligian|first1=Bob|title=Courtrooms guilty of stress disorder|url=http://lasvegassun.com/news/1996/jul/22/courtrooms-guilty-of-stress-disorder/|website=http://lasvegassun.com/|publisher=Las Vegas Sun|accessdate=30 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Dr. Karin Huffer|url=https://casetext.com/users/dr-karin-huffer|website=casetext.com|publisher=Case Text|accessdate=30 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
Since 1988, Huffer has worked to develop methods in training advocates in court to help those suffering from LAS. A diagnosis of LAS-related PTSD directs the court, through the [[Americans With Disabilities Act]], to offer special accommodations to the litigant. As one of the few recognized expert witnesses in the field of LAS, Dr. Huffer provides treatment, consultation, and expert witness testimony for persons with disabilities, including invisible disabilities, (i.e. autism, [[Traumatic brain injury|TBI]], PTSD, depression, and anxiety) across the country.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Court can be life-changing|url=https://www.newsreview.com/reno/court-can-be-life-changing/content?oid=15103429|website=NewsReview.com|accessdate=30 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Current work==
Huffer trains advocates working with clients effected by the Americans with Disabilities Act in methods to provide accommodations for legal abuse-related symptoms through a program called Equal Access Advocates.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=EAA Advocate Training: About Us|url=http://www.equalaccessadvocates.com/about-us/|website=Equal Access Advocates|accessdate=30 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Huffer has been an Associate Professor in Counseling and Forensic Psychology at Kings International University and is currently working as an Adjunct Professor at [[John Jay College]], a part of the [[City University of New York]], in the College of Criminal Justice.&lt;ref name="King's International University, Forensic Psychology, Faculty Member"&gt;{{cite web|title=Karin P.

The '''Lusaka Ceasefire Agreement''' attempted to end the [[Second Congo War]] through a [[ceasefire]], release of [[prisoners of war]], and the deployment of an international peacekeeping force under the auspices of the [[United Nations]]. The [[heads of state]] of [[Angola]], the [[Democratic Republic of the Congo]], [[Namibia]], [[Rwanda]], [[Uganda]], [[Zambia]], and [[Zimbabwe]] signed the agreement in [[Lusaka]], Zambia on July 10, 1999.&lt;ref name=a&gt;{{cite book|last=Laurent Baregu|first=Mwesiga|author2=Chris Landsberg |year=2003|title=From Cape to Congo: Southern Africa's Evolving Security Challenges|publisher=International Peace Academy|pages=214}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=b&gt;{{cite web|author=|url=http://www.reliefweb.int/rw/RWB.NSF/db900SID/MHII-65HB37?OpenDocument|title=DR Congo: Lusaka Ceasefire Agreement|publisher=ReliefWeb|accessdate=2008-01-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Negotiation==
[[Image:ZM-Lusaka.png|thumb|250px|Lusaka, Zambia]]
Representatives from the [[Southern African Development Community]], [[Organization of African Unity]], and the [[United Nations]] met in Lusaka and drafted the ceasefire agreement from June 21–27, 1999. Defense and Foreign Ministers of the parties to the conflict then met from June 29 to July 7 to discuss the agreement.&lt;ref name=a/&gt;

[[Zambian President]] [[Frederick Chiluba]] played a major role in the signing of the agreement in his role as Chairman of the Regional Initiative for Peace in the Democratic Republic of the Congo.&lt;ref name=a/&gt;

==Treaty terms==
The parties agreed to halt all military operations within 24 hours of signing the agreement in Article I, clause 2, section c. Article I prohibited further military movement or the transfer of armaments to the [[battle]]field and called on all nations to respect [[human rights]] and protect civilians. Article III released all [[prisoners of war]] in clause 8 and gave the [[International Red Cross]] the task of assisting the wounded in clause 9. Clause 11 requested the deployment of a United Nations [[peacekeeping]] force in accordance with [[Chapter VII of the United Nations Charter]].&lt;ref name=c&gt;{{cite web|author= |url=https://www.un.org/aboutun/charter/ |title=Chapter VII Action with Respect to Threats to the Peace, Breaches of the Peace, and Acts of Aggression |publisher=United Nations |accessdate=2008-01-07 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090220011242/http://www.un.org/aboutun/charter/ |archivedate=2009-02-20 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The document also requested that the OAU establish a temporary peacekeeping force to combat militant groups until the UN force arrived.&lt;ref name=b/&gt; Mwesiga Laurent Baregu and Chris Landsberg of the International Peace Academy criticized this provision in 2003, saying the OAU had been overwhelmed and the SADC was better equipped to handle the burden.&lt;ref name=a/&gt;

==Implementation==
The [[United Nations Secretary General]] issued a report recommending the deployment of an observer mission in the DRC on July 15, 1999. The [[United States State Department]] announced its support for a peace mission on July 23. The MLC signed the agreement on August 1. Five days later the [[United Nations Security Council]] passed [[United Nations Security Council Resolution 1258|Resolution 1258]] deploying military liaison personnel to the capitals of the signatories of the Ceasefire Agreement and established a Joint Military Commission to oversee its implementation. The [[Rally for Congolese Democracy]] (RCD) rebel group signed the agreement on August 31. The Security Council established the [[United Nations Mission in the Democratic Republic of Congo]] (MONUC) in [[United Nations Security Council Resolution 1273|Resolution 1273]], passed on November 5, to January 15, 2000. [[United Nations Security Council Resolution 1279|Resolution 1279]], passed on November 30, extended the mandate to March 1, 2000.&lt;ref name=d&gt;{{cite book|last=Government Accounting Office (GAO)|first=|year=2000|title=U.N. peacekeeping executive branch consultations with Congress did not fully meet expectations in 1999-2000|page=51}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6509">The '''Militia Acts of 1792''' were a pair of [[statute]]s enacted by the [[2nd United States Congress|second]] [[United States Congress]] in 1792.  The acts provided for the organization of the state [[militia]]s and provided for the [[President of the United States]] to take command of the state militias in times of imminent invasion or insurrection. This authority was used to suppress the [[Whiskey Rebellion]] in 1794.

==History==
The Militia Acts were passed in response to the overwhelming U.S. losses at [[St. Clair's Defeat]] in 1791.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Schecter |first=Barnet |title=George Washington's America. A Biography Through His Maps |page=238 |publisher=Walker &amp; Company |location=New York |year=2010 |isbn=978-0-8027-1748-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The [[United States Constitution|Constitution]] permitted [[United States Congress|Congress]] to provide for calling forth the militia, but it was understood at the time that the president could not do so on his own authority absent that statutory provision. There was a widespread fear that the [[Western Confederacy]] of [[Native Americans in the United States|American Indians]] would exploit their victory during the [[recess (motion)|recess]] of Congress. St. Clair's defeat was blamed in part on the poor organization and equipment of his army.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Samuel Hodgdon, 5th Quartermaster General |publisher=US Army Quartermaster Foundation |location=Fort Lee, Virginia |accessdate=9 May 2011 |url=http://www.qmfound.com/Samuel_Hodgdon.htm |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110514035058/http://www.qmfound.com/Samuel_Hodgdon.htm |archivedate=14 May 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Congress took action to remedy these problems in 1792.

==First Militia Act of 1792 ''([[wikisource:United_States_Statutes_at_Large/Volume_1/2nd_Congress/1st_Session/Chapter_28|full text]])''==
The first Act, passed May 2, 1792, provided for the authority of the president to call out the militias of the several [[U.S. state|states]], "whenever the [[United States]] shall be invaded, or be in imminent danger of invasion from any foreign nation or Indian tribe".&lt;ref&gt;[[s:Militia Act of 1792#Sec. 1.|Militia Act of 1792]], May 2, 1792, art. I, ss. 1&lt;/ref&gt;  The law also authorized the President to call the militias into Federal service "whenever the laws of the United States shall be opposed or the execution thereof obstructed, in any state, by combinations too powerful to be suppressed by the ordinary course of judicial proceedings, or by the powers vested in the [[U.S. marshal|marshals]] by this act".&lt;ref&gt;Militia Act of 1792, May 2, 1792, art. I, ss. 2&lt;/ref&gt;  This provision likely referred to uprisings such as [[Shays' Rebellion]]. The president's authority in both cases was to expire after two years.

==Second Militia Act of 1792 ''[[wikisource:United_States_Statutes_at_Large/Volume_1/2nd_Congress/1st_Session/Chapter_33|(full text)]]''==
[[Image:Columbiancentinelxvii.jpg|thumb|right|220px|Front page of a newspaper announcing the second Militia Act of 1792.]]

The second Act, passed May 8, 1792, provided for the organization of the state militias.  It [[conscription|conscripted]] every "free able-bodied white male citizen" between the ages of 18 and 45 into a local militia company.  (This was later expanded to all males, regardless of race, between the ages of 18 and 54 in 1862.)

Militia members, referred to as "every citizen, so enrolled and notified", "...shall within six months thereafter, provide himself..." with a [[musket]], [[bayonet]] and belt, two spare flints, a [[cartridge_(firearms)#History|cartridge]] box with 24 bullets, and a knapsack.  Men owning rifles were required to provide a powder horn, ¼ pound of gunpowder, 20 rifle balls, a shooting pouch, and a knapsack.&lt;ref&gt;Militia Act of 1792, May 8, 1792, art. I, ss. 1(i)&lt;/ref&gt;  Some occupations were exempt, such as congressmen, stagecoach drivers, and ferryboatmen.  

The militias were divided into "[[division (military)|division]]s, [[brigade]]s, [[regiment]]s, [[battalion]]s, and [[company (military unit)|companies]]" as the state legislatures would direct.&lt;ref&gt;Militia Act of 1792, May 8, 1792, art. I, ss. 1(iii)3&lt;/ref&gt;  The provisions of the first Act governing the calling up of the militia by the president in case of invasion or obstruction to law enforcement were continued in the second act.&lt;ref&gt;Militia Act of 1792, May 8, 1792, art. I, ss. 3&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Court martial]] proceedings were authorized by the statute against militia members who disobeyed orders.&lt;ref&gt;Militia Act of 1792, May 2, 1792, art. I, ss. 5&lt;/ref&gt;

==Use and subsequent amendments==
The authority to call forth the militia was first invoked by George Washington to put down the [[Whiskey rebellion]] in Western Pennsylvania in 1794, just before the law granting that authority expired. Congress quickly passed the [[Militia Act of 1795]], which by and large mirrored the provisions of the 1792 Act. The Militia Act of 1795 was in turn amended by the [[Militia Act of 1862]], which allowed [[African-American]]s to serve in the militias of the United States.  It was superseded by the [[Militia Act of 1903]], which established the [[United States National Guard]] as the chief body of organized military reserves in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;Michael Dale Doubler, John W. Listman, Jr., [https://books.google.com/books?id=cpaCSfXbbusC&amp;pg=PA54#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false ''The National Guard: An Illustrated History of America's Citizen-Soldiers''], Washington, D.C.: Brassey's, Inc., 2003, {{ISBN|978-1-57488-389-3}}, page 53.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''[[Mount Cook Group]] Ltd v Johnstone Motors Ltd''' [1990] 2 NZLR 488 is a cited case in New Zealand regarding claims in [[defamation]] and the issue of identification of the plaintiff and defamatory meaning.&lt;ref name="McLay"&gt;{{cite book |title=Butterworths Student Companion Torts |edition=6th |last1=McLay |first1=Geoff |publisher=LexisNexis |ISBN=9781877511400|year=2010 |page=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
Johnstone Motors purchased a sport shop in Queenstown. Amongst the stock that was included in the sale were hundreds of posters depicting a groom with his hand under his brides wedding dress, with the quote "Please darling - No children yet, fun first, let's ski Coronet Peak - Queenstown".

Mount Cook Group, which owned [[Coronet Peak]] ski field for over 40 years, were facing a consumer boycott of its airline on the basis that Mount Cook was behind this sexist poster.

MCG initially made several attempts at requesting that Johnstone Motors stop selling these posters, but the reply was that MCG could purchase all the offending posters they wanted.

MCG sued them for $15,000 in damages, as well as filing for an injunction preventing further sales.

==Held==
The Court awarded $1,000 in damages. The injunction was also granted.

The '''Biblioteca Nacional do Brasil''' (English: ''National Library of Brazil'') is the depository of the bibliographic and documentary heritage of [[Brazil]]. It is located in [[Rio de Janeiro]],the Capital of Brazil from 1822-1960, more specifically at [[Cinelândia]] square.

The largest library in [[Latin America]] and the 7th largest in the world, its collections include about 9 million items.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bn.br/portal/?nu_pagina=11 Fundação Biblioteca Nacional&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; It organized the first library science courses in Latin America and its staff has led the modernization of library services, including the development of online databases.&lt;ref&gt;Murray, Stuart A. P. “The Library: An Illustrated History.” New York, NY: [[Skyhorse Publishing]], 2012, p. 277.&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
[[File:Americana 1920 Libraries - Bibliotheca Nacional Rio de Janeiro.jpg|thumb|left|National Library, c. 1920]]
The history of the National Library began on 1 November 1755, when Lisbon suffered a violent earthquake. The Royal Library was considered one of the most important libraries in Europe at that time. This irreparable loss to the Portuguese was the impetus for moving many of its contents to Brazil.  The collection was brought in three stages, the first being in 1810 and two in 1811. The library of 60,000 books was accommodated initially in the upstairs rooms of the Third Order of Carmel Hospital (in accordance with the charter of July 27, 1810), located in the old back street of Carmel close to the [[Paço Imperial|Imperial Palace]]. The facilities, however, were considered inadequate and could jeopardize valuable collection as well. Therefore, on 29 October 1810, a date that was assigned to the official founding of the National Library, Prince Regent John (later King [[John VI of Portugal|John VI of Portugal, Brazil and the Algarves]]) issued a decree which provided that a royal library should be established from the funds of the royal treasury.&lt;ref&gt;Murray, S. (2009). The library : an illustrated history / Stuart A.P. Murray ; introduction by Donald G. Davis, Jr. ; foreword by Nicholas A. Basbanes. New York, NY : [[Skyhorse Pub.]] ; Chicago : ALA Editions, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Expansion===
[[File:Bibliotecanacional2.jpg|thumb|Main entrance to the Library]]
The works for the new building of the Library only took place in 1813, when the collection was transferred. While the process of setting up the books, which began in 1810, was taking place the consultation of the Library collection could already be carried out by scholars, by royal consent, and in 1814, after the collection of the collection was completed, the consultation was public.

Officially established, the library continued to have a significant expansion through purchases, donations, mainly, and "tips", that is, by the obligatory delivery of a copy of all printed material in the typographic offices of Portugal (By decree of 12 September 1805) and in the Royal Printing, installed in [[Rio de Janeiro]]. This legislation on tips was improved over the years and culminated in Decree No. 1,825 of 20 December 1907, commonly called the Legal Deposit Decree, still in force.

===Transfer of sovereignity===
After the death of [[Maria I of Brazil|Queen Maria I]] in March 1816, the reign of [[John VI of Portugal|King John VI]] began, and it remained in Brazil until 1821, when political circumstances made him return to [[Lisbon]] with the [[House of Braganza|Royal Family]], except for his eldest son [[Pedro I of Brazil|Prince Pedro de Alcântara of Braganza]] (future [[Emperor of Brazil]]), who came to proclaim the independence of Brazil in 1822. Here also remained the Royal Library. At that time it had grown a lot and, after Independence, in 1822, became property of the [[Empire of Brazil]], because its purchase is included in the Additional Convention to the [[Treaty of Rio de Janeiro (1825)|Treaty of Friendship and Alliance signed between Brazil and Portugal]] on 29 August 1825. For the goods left in Brazil the Royal Family was indemnified in two million [[pounds sterling]], of that value, eight hundred ''[[Brazilian real (old)|contos de reis]]'' were destined to the payment of the Royal Library, which was then called the Imperial and Public Library of the Court.

===Building===
[[File:0200 years Biblioteca Nacional in Rio de Janeiro city.jpg|thumb|left|Façade of the current building in 2010]]
In 1858, the Library was transferred to the Passeio street, number 60, in Lapa square, and installed in the building that had the purpose to better shelter its collection. As its collection continued to grow with donations, acquisitions and through legal contributions, purchase of rare art collections at auctions and in bookstores around the world, a new building was needed that best suited its needs.

The constant and permanent growth of the collection of the library was fundamental for the realization of a project of construction of a seat that would attend all the needs of the library, adequately accommodating its collections. Based on this, his current building was designed, which had its cornerstone launched on 15 August 1905, during the government of [[Rodrigues Alves]]. The inauguration took place on 29 October 1910, during the [[Nilo Peçanha]] government and in the first centenary of the Library.

The building of the National Library, whose project is signed by the military engineer Sousa Aguiar, has an [[eclectic style]], in which [[Neoclassical architecture|neoclassical]] and [[art nouveau]] elements are mixed, and contains ornaments by artists such as Eliseu Visconti, Henrique and Rodolfo Bernardelli, Modesto Brocos and Rodolfo Amoedo. Eliseu Visconti, still in 1903, had already designed the ''ex-libris'' and the emblem of the National Library.

The library building is located at [[Avenida Rio Branco|Rio Branco Avenue]], number 219, [[Cinelândia]] Square, in the center of Rio de Janeiro, composing with the [[Museu Nacional de Belas Artes|National Museum of Fine Arts]] and the [[Theatro Municipal (Rio de Janeiro)|Municipal Theater]] an architectural and cultural ensemble of great value.

===Catalog===
In 1911, Manoel Cicero Peregrino da Silva started a national union catalog for all Brazilian libraries. He set up the first library science course in South America. Many librarians went on to study in European and North American universities.&lt;ref&gt;Wayne A. Wiegand and Donald G Davis, Jr., eds, ''Encyclopedia of Library History'' (1994) pp 86=87&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legal deposit==
In 1907, presidential Decree no. 1825&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.planalto.gov.br/ccivil_03/decreto/1900-1909/DPL1825.htm Decree 1825 of 20 December 1907]&lt;/ref&gt; established the duty of all publishers to send one copy of each publication to then-called ''Bibliotheca Nacional''. In 2004, this decree was revoked by congressional Law no. 10,994,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.planalto.gov.br/ccivil_03/_Ato2004-2006/2004/Lei/L10994.htm Law 10,994 of 14 December 2004]&lt;/ref&gt; still in force, upholding the same mandate but updating its provisions.

Article 1st of Law no. 10,994 specifies that the legal deposit's aim is "to ensure the registration and custody of national intellectual production, to allow for the control, development and spreading of current Brazilian bibliography, and to defend and preserve national language and culture."

==Significant collections==
Among the significant collections of the National Library of Brazil is the Teresa Cristina Maria photograph collection, which includes 21,742 photographs dating from the nineteenth century. These photographs were left to the Library by [[Pedro II of Brazil|Emperor Pedro II]] in 1891.&lt;ref name=WDL1&gt;{{cite web|title=Old Recife|url=http://www.wdl.org/en/item/1673/|publisher=World Digital Library|accessdate=21 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; This collection has been inscribed on [[UNESCO|UNESCO's]] [[Memory of the World Programme]] Register in 2003 in recognition of its world significance and outstanding universal value.&lt;ref name=Thereza&gt;{{cite web| title= The Emperor's collection: foreign and Brazilian photography in the XIX century | date=2008-05-16 |url= http://www.unesco.org/new/en/communication-and-information/flagship-project-activities/memory-of-the-world/register/full-list-of-registered-heritage/registered-heritage-page-8/the-emperors-collection-foreign-and-brazilian-photography-in-the-xix-century/ |publisher=UNESCO Memory of the World Programme |accessdate=2012-12-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; It features images related to Brazil's history and people from the 19th century, including photographs by [[Moritz Lamberg]]. There are also photographs from [[Africa]], [[North America]], and [[Europe]].&lt;ref name=WDL1/&gt;

{{Refimprove|date=February 2017}}
A '''netlabel''' (also '''online label''', '''web label''', '''digi label''', '''MP3 label''' or '''download label''') is a [[record label]] that distributes its music through [[digital audio]] [[file format|formats]] (such as [[MP3]], [[Vorbis|Ogg Vorbis]],  [[FLAC]], or [[WAV]]) over the [[Internet]]. While similar to traditional record labels in many respects, netlabels typically emphasize free distribution online, often under licenses that encourage works to be shared (e.g., [[Creative Commons]] licenses), and artists often retain [[copyright]].&lt;ref&gt;https://web.archive.org/web/20110814083254/http://www.freesoftwaremagazine.com/articles/netlabels&lt;/ref&gt;

Netlabels may have a considerably lower staff count than traditional record labels, in some instances being only a single individual in control of his/her music, maintaining sole ownership.{{Citation needed|date=November 2010}} Physical [[LP album|LP]]s, for example, are rarely produced by a netlabel, relying entirely on [[digital distribution]] and means of the [[Internet]] to provide the product. Having no physical product makes the running costs of a netlabel considerably less than a traditional record label and some netlabels have abandoned any financial model altogether and instead, running the netlabel as a [[hobby]].{{Citation needed|date=November 2010}} Some employ [[guerrilla marketing]] to promote their work.{{Citation needed|date=November 2010}}

==History==
Online music groups date back almost as far as the history of personal computers, and share close ties with [[video game]]s and the [[demoscene]]. Early music groups released music in [[Module file|MOD]] formats, typically as part of a [[Module file#Music disk|music disk]], which often included a MOD player, visual effects, and textual information.{{Citation needed|date=November 2010}}

Netlabels began to branch out from the [[tracker (music software)|tracker]] scene when the lossy [[MP3]] file format became popular in the late 1990s. Some are still dedicated to [[electronic music]] and related genres, though this is rapidly changing and the quality of downloads are getting higher with the use of FLAC downloads offering CD quality uncompressed music. {{Citation needed|date=November 2010}}

'''Paul Matthew Gambaccini''' (born April 2, 1949) is an [[American-British]] [[Radio presenter|radio]] and [[television presenter]] and author in the [[United Kingdom]]. He has dual United States and British nationality, having become a British citizen in 2005.

Known as  "The Great Gambo"&lt;ref&gt;Burrell, Ian. [https://www.independent.co.uk/news/media/paul-gambaccini-here-there-and-everywhere-443896.html "Paul Gambaccini: Here, there and everywhere,"] ''The Independent'' (09 April 2007)&lt;/ref&gt; and "The Professor of Pop",&lt;ref&gt;Topping, Alexandra. [https://www.theguardian.com/music/2011/jan/10/rock-n-roll-read-last-rites "RIP rock'n'roll? Professor of pop reads the last rites: Rock songs in the charts fall to lowest level in 50 years, with only three tracks appearing in the top 100 best-sellers,"] ''The Guardian'' (10 January 2011).&lt;/ref&gt; Gambaccini was a [[BBC Radio 1]] presenter for 16 years, including 11 years at the helm of a ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' Top 30 countdown show. A regular contributor to [[BBC Radio 4]]'s long-running arts programme ''[[Kaleidoscope (UK radio series)|Kaleidoscope]]'', Gambaccini was a long-time TV morning show correspondent for British television, and makes regular appearances on other British TV magazine shows. He was the host of the 12-part [[Classic FM (UK)|Classic FM]] series ''Paul Gambaccini's Hall of Heroes'', and chairs the [[BBC Radio 4|Radio 4]] music quiz ''[[Counterpoint (radio)|Counterpoint]]''. He is currently the presenter of “Pick of the Pops” on [[BBC Radio 2]] on Saturday afternoons. Inducted into the [[Radio Academy Hall of Fame]] in 2005, Gambaccini is the author of more than 15 books.

==Education==
Born in [[the Bronx]], [[New York City]],&lt;ref name=Schelly&gt;[[Bill Schelly|Schelly, Bill]]. ''Founders of Comic Fandom: Profiles of 90 Publishers, Dealers, Collectors, Writers, Artists and Other Luminaries of the 1950s and 1960s'', (McFarland, 2010), pp. 176–177.&lt;/ref&gt; Gambaccini studied at [[Dartmouth College]], where he obtained a degree in history in 1970.&lt;ref name = Schelly /&gt;

He then migrated to the United Kingdom and attended [[University College, Oxford]],&lt;ref name = Schelly /&gt; where he read for a degree in [[politics, philosophy and economics]]. He has since returned to [[Oxford]], where he delivered a series of lectures in January and February 2009, as the [[News International]] Visiting Professor of Broadcast Media. In February 2010 he was invited by the [[Vice-Chancellor of Oxford University]], [[Andrew D. Hamilton|Andrew Hamilton]] to deliver the inaugural [[LGBT]] lecture ''Out on Monday'' to the university's LGBT staff, students and faculty.

==Broadcasting career==
Gambaccini's broadcasting career began at [[Dartmouth College]], where he was music director of [[WDCR (defunct)|WDCR]], a former student-operated [[Top 40 (radio format)|Top 40]] radio station. Gambaccini may have first achieved wider prominence when his tips for playlisted songs likely to see greater chart action were published in the 11 May 1968 issue of the international trade publication ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'', alongside similar tips from radio programming talent at major commercial stations across the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=pwoEAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA20 |title=Programming Aids |work=[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]] |date=11 May 1968 |pages=20–24 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Having left Oxford, Gambaccini considered further study in law at [[Harvard]] or [[Yale]], but had the opportunity of writing for ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' magazine, as British correspondent.&lt;ref name = Schelly /&gt; He attributes his broadcasting career to this post—especially an interview in 1973 with [[Elton John]] which brought him to the attention of BBC Radio producer [[John Walters (broadcaster)|John Walters]] who arranged for him to present on [[BBC Radio 1]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.broadcastnow.co.uk/news/radio/paul-gambaccini-bbc-radio-2/5002813.article |title=Paul Gambaccini, BBC Radio 2 |first=Michael |last=Rosser |work=[[Broadcast (magazine)|Broadcast]] |date=25 June 2009 |subscription=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/news/elton-john-the-rolling-stone-interview-19730816 |title=Elton John: The Rolling Stone Interview | author=Paul Gambaccini  |date =August 16, 1973 |work=Rolling Stone }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Gambaccini then started broadcasting in the UK, on BBC Radio 1, September 1973, which he did for 13 years, first as a music reporter on the [[John Peel]] Saturday show, ''Rockspeak''. He started his own U.S. chart show on 27 September 1975. He was the presenter of the ''Billboard'' US Top 30 singles chart in the UK every Saturday afternoon until his last show on 8 February 1986. Thereafter, he moved to independent radio to host ''American Countdown''. In 1990, he returned to Radio 1, but left during the tenure of controller [[Matthew Bannister]] in 1993.

In 1992, Gambaccini became a founding presenter on the UK's classical music station [[Classic FM (UK)|Classic FM]], where he presented the weekly Classical CD Chart show. He left for [[BBC Radio 3]] in 1995, where he presented an hour-long morning programme, in a slot formerly used for ''Composer of the Week''. He returned to Classic FM in 1997.

Alongside his work in music radio, he contributed regularly to [[BBC Radio 4]]'s long-running arts programme ''[[Kaleidoscope (UK radio series)|Kaleidoscope]]'' between 1975 and 1998.

For 13 years Gambaccini reviewed films for breakfast television, first on [[TV-am]] and then [[GMTV]]. In the early 1980s he presented ''The Other Side of the Tracks'' on [[Channel 4]], which ran for three series. His other television appearances include ''[[Pebble Mill at One]]'', ''[[Call My Bluff]]'', ''Music for the Millennium'', and ''[[The South Bank Show]]''.

In 1998, he joined [[BBC Radio 2]]. His first show was on 18 April 1998, once again opening the first of his weekly shows ''America's Greatest Hits'' with "[[Born to Run (Bruce Springsteen song)|Born to Run]]" by [[Bruce Springsteen]]. In 2002, he quit his role at [[Classic FM (UK)|Classic FM]], to present a weekly chart show on London's [[102.2 Jazz FM|Jazz FM]] until 2004. He was also a contributor to the London station [[LBC]] when it was taken over by Chrysalis.

He has worked widely across the BBC and the [[British Forces Broadcasting Service]] (BFBS) as well as contributing to many television shows, mostly related to music, film, and the arts. He narrated the BBC Radio [[Espedair Street (radio)|adaptation]] of ''[[Espedair Street]]'', the [[Iain Banks]] novel.

Gambaccini has presented the annual [[Ivor Novello Awards]] since 1990,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Felicity |last=Thistlethwaite |date=22 May 2014 |title=Paul Gambaccini hosts Ivor Novello awards six months after arrest under Operation Yewtree |url=http://www.express.co.uk/news/showbiz/477585/Paul-Gambaccini-hosts-Ivor-Novello-awards-and-Fleetwood-Mac-Christine-McVie-honoured |work=[[Daily Express]] |accessdate=14 August 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; the [[Parliamentary Jazz Awards]] since 2005, the Music Industry Trust's Man of the Year Dinner since 1999, and the [[Radio Academy Awards]] for a ten-year stretch from 1998 to 2008.

In August 2008, Gambaccini returned to Classic FM, to present a 12-part series ''Paul Gambaccini's Hall of Heroes'' on Sunday evenings between 9 pm and 10 pm. In March 2008, he took over as chairman of the [[BBC Radio 4|Radio 4]] music quiz ''[[Counterpoint (radio)|Counterpoint]]'' from [[Edward Seckerson]]; he was temporarily  replaced in 2013 by [[Russell Davies]] and returned to the show in November 2014 after being cleared of allegations of historical sexual offences made against him. He returned to Radio 2 with ''America's Greatest Hits'' on 15 November 2014 and hosted it until 2 July 2016 when he took over Pick of the Pops from [[Tony Blackburn]], the following week. He started his final America's Greatest Hits' with [[Born to Run (Bruce Springsteen song)|Born to Run]]" by [[Bruce Springsteen]] and ended it with [[Justin Timberlake]].

[[Trevor Nelson]] took over the Saturday timeslot that was allocated to Gambaccini's ''America's Greatest Hits'' programme for many years.{{cn|date=November 2018}}

==Books==
Gambaccini was co-author of ''The Guinness Book of British Hit Singles'' and related titles, with [[Tim Rice|Tim]] and Jo Rice, alongside Radio 1 colleague at that time, [[Mike Read]], between 1977 and 1996. Gambaccini's own books include ''Love Letters'', ''Radio Boy'', ''Top 100 Albums'' and ''Track Records''. ''The Ultimate Man'', a musical about a comic book [[superhero]], was co-written with [[Alastair King]] and Jane Edith Wilson, and produced at the Bridewell Theatre in London in 2000.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=Lyn |last=Gardner|publisher=theguardian.com|date=11 May 2000|title=The Ultimate Man|url=https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2000/may/11/theatre.artsfeatures1 |accessdate=14 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Comic book fandom==
Gambaccini was active in the realm of [[comic book]] fandom. As an American teenager in the 1960s his missives were regularly published in the [[Comic book letter column|letter columns]] of titles such as ''[[Justice League of America]]'' and ''[[The Amazing Spider-Man]]''.&lt;ref name=Schelly /&gt; Gambaccini claims to have invented the term "[[Not Brand Echh|Brand Echh]]", which later became widely used by [[Stan Lee]].&lt;ref name=Schelly /&gt;

While still in high school,&lt;ref name=Schelly /&gt; Gambaccini began contributing to comics [[fanzines]], including the publication ''[[Rocket's Blast Comicollector]]''. In 1964&lt;ref name=Schelly /&gt; he succeeded [[Jerry Bails]] (the so-called "father of comic book fandom") as executive secretary of the [[Academy of Comic-Book Fans and Collectors]],&lt;ref&gt;"With a Little Help From His Friends...," ''Alter Ego'' vol. 3, #25 (June 2003) pp. 14-19.&lt;/ref&gt; an umbrella organization for the burgeoning world of comics fandom.&lt;ref&gt;Schelly, Bill. "Jerry Bails' Ten Building Blocks of Fandom," ''Alter Ego'' vol. 3, #25 (June 2003), pp. 5-8.&lt;/ref&gt; As part of his involvement with the academy, Gambaccini helped organize the comics industry's first awards, the [[Alley Awards]].

Gambaccini and television presenter [[Jonathan Ross]] co-owned Top 10 Comics, a comic shop in London which opened in 1989 and closed in 1995.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/media/mediamonkeyblog+jonathan-ross "Media Monkey + Jonathan Ross: The Guardian's blog on advertising, marketing and the media industry,"] ''The Guardian'' (9 January 2013)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Urchin|first1=Zoe|title=Top Ten Soho comic book store 1989-1993|url=http://www.wolfshead.co.uk/top%20ten%20comic%20archive.html|website=Wolfshead|publisher=Wolfshead Promotions|accessdate=9 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Gambaccini has been an official guest at many British comic conventions, including the [[United Kingdom Comic Art Convention]] (where he co-presented the 1990 [[Eagle Awards (comics)|Eagle Awards]] and the 1997 [[National Comics Awards]]), and [[Comics Festival UK]].

A character introduced in ''The Flash'' #141 named [[Paul Gambi]], a tailor specializing in super-villain outfits, is an homage to Paul Gambaccini.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=y9YRzodtmKcC&amp;pg=PA177&amp;lpg=PA177&amp;dq=paul+gambi+paul+gambaccini&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=bR81q2SOUU&amp;sig=Ym_vxJTTdNDkzok8J0nTybGErcw&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;sqi=2&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjljpKyl_TNAhUBzGMKHZS8CPAQ6AEILjAD#v=onepage&amp;q=paul%20gambi%20paul%20gambaccini&amp;f=false Founders of Comic Fandom: Profiles of 90 Publishers, Dealers, Collectors, by Bill Schelly]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Operation Yewtree==
On 1 November 2013, it was reported that Gambaccini had been arrested on suspicion of historical sexual offences as part of an investigation by [[Operation Yewtree]] in the United Kingdom.  He was released on bail and his spokesman said that he denied the allegations.&lt;ref name="bbc 011113"&gt;[https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-24779908 "Paul Gambaccini arrested in Operation Yewtree inquiry"], BBC News, 1 November 2013&lt;/ref&gt;
It was announced on 10 October 2014 that no charges would be brought.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-29574077|title=BBC News - No charges for broadcaster Paul Gambaccini  in Yewtree case|work=BBC News|accessdate=10 October 2014|date=10 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Giving evidence to the House of Commons [[Home Affairs Select Committee]] on 3 March 2015, Gambaccini said he believed he was used as human "fly paper" to encourage other people to come forward and make allegations against him and that he had lost more than £200,000 in earnings and legal fees. The [[BBC]] reported that he also "said he suspected his bail was repeatedly extended until the end of high-profile cases involving other celebrities because police did not want juries to hear a former Radio 1 DJ had been cleared of sexual wrongdoing". Gambaccini also argued in favour of a 28-day bail limit; [[Home Secretary]] [[Theresa May]] had announced in December 2014 that she was consulting on such a limit in all but exceptional cases. However, Gambaccini's allegations of a "witch-hunt" were denied by the [[Director of Public Prosecutions (England and Wales)|Director of Public Prosecutions]] (DPP).&lt;ref name="BBC News 3 March 2015"&gt;{{cite news | title= Paul Gambaccini backs 28-day bail limit after Operation Yewtree arrest |url=  https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-31720761| author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt;|date= 3 March 2015 | website= BBC News | accessdate= 3 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The 28-day limit came into effect in April 2017.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/28-day-police-bail-limit-suspects-charged-new-police-rule-comes-into-force-today-a7663196.html |title=Police bail for suspects capped at 28 days |last=Peck |first=Tom |work=The Independent|date=2 April 2017|accessdate=27 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Gambaccini wrote an account of his experience in his book ''Love, Paul Gambaccini: My Year Under the Yewtree'', which was published in 2015.&lt;ref name="Innocence02a"&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/books/reviews/love-paul-gambaccini-by-paul-gambaccini-book-review-an-absorbing-account-of-a-year-of-injustice-a6680586.html | work=[[The Independent]]| title=Love, Paul Gambaccini by Paul Gambaccini - book review: An absorbing account of a year of injustice | author=John Clarke|date=5 October 2015 | accessdate=7 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=LovePaulGamba01a&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Pd2GCgAAQBAJ |title=Love, Paul Gambaccini: My Year Under the Yewtree|publisher=[[Biteback Publishing]]|author=Paul Gambaccini | date=2015|isbn=9781849549943|accessdate=8 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In February 2016, the Irish Supreme Court Judge [[Adrian Hardiman]] used a review of this book to criticize what he described as the radical undermining of the [[presumption of innocence]], especially in sex cases, including Gambaccini's case, by the methods used in Operation Yewtree (among other instances).&lt;ref name="Innocence01a"&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.irishtimes.com/news/crime-and-law/hardiman-questions-methods-of-uk-sex-claim-inquiries-1.2533054 | work=[[Irish Times]]| title=Hardiman questions methods of UK sex-claim inquiries | date=13 February 2016 | accessdate=7 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In February 2017, Gambaccini sued the Metropolitan Police, citing a loss of £200,000 during his time under investigation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.thetimes.co.uk/edition/news/victims-of-abuse-inquiry-blunders-sue-met-for-3m-fx59stc2h |last1=O'Neill |last2=Hamilton |first1= Sean |first2= Fiona | work=[[The Times]]| title=Victims of abuse inquiry blunders sue Met for £3m | date= 14 February 2017 | accessdate= 15 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; In November 2018, he settled a claim against the [[Crown Prosecution Service]], who agreed to pay him damages; the amount paid to Gambaccini by the CPS was not disclosed due to confidentiality clauses in the settlement agreement.&lt;ref name=PG&amp;CPDsettlementGuardian&gt;{{cite web |title=Paul Gambaccini wins CPS payout over unfounded sexual abuse claims |work=BBC Radio 2 DJ described the case against him, which was later dropped, as ‘completely ficitious’ |date=2 November 2018 |url=https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2018/nov/02/paul-gambaccini-wins-cps-payout-over-unfounded-sexual-abuse-claims |publisher=[[The Guardian]], London |accessdate=3 November 1919}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Paul Gambaccini secures CPS payout over unfounded abuse claims |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-46080092 |work=BBC News |date=3 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="19344">'''Policy entrepreneur''' refers to an individual who takes advantage of opportunities to influence policy outcomes to increase their self-interests. The term was first coined by American [[political scientist]] [[John W. Kingdon]] in his influential work ''[[John W. Kingdon|Agendas, Alternatives and Public Policies]]'' published in 1995.&lt;ref name="KINGDONBOOK" /&gt; Kingdon created the Multiple Streams Framework (MSF) which outlines that the policy process can be situated into problems, policy and politics. Political entrepreneurs are most active in the policy stream, creating solutions to potential problems and bringing them forth to the agenda setting process. The Multiple Streams Framework is a powerful tool to understand policy making and agenda setting. It was first created to analyze and understand agenda setting in the [[United States]].&lt;ref name="Knaggard"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Knaggard|first1=Å|title=The Multiple Streams Framework and the problem broker|journal=Eur J Polit Res|date=2015|issue=54|pages=450–465}}&lt;/ref&gt; Policy entrepreneurs are the most important actors in the Multiple Streams Framework, as they develop policy alternatives and couple them with problems to present solutions to policy makers at the right time. He himself describes them as "advocates who are willing to invest their resources - time, energy, reputation, money - to promote a position in return for anticipated future gain in the form of material, purposive or solidary benefits" &lt;ref name="KINGDONBOOK"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Kingdon|first1=John|title=Agendas, Alternatives, and Public Policies|date=2003|publisher=Pearson|location=New York, NY|edition=2nd}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Policy entrepreneurs use innovative ideas and non-traditional strategies to influence society, create opportunities, and promote desired policy outcomes. Policy entrepreneurship usually happens over three phases. It starts with a demand in the political landscape for some form of innovation involving a public good.&lt;ref name="MintromSolo"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Mintrom|first1=M|title=Policy Entrepreneurs and the Diffusion of Innovation|journal=American Journal of Political Science|date=1997|volume=41|issue=3|page=738|doi=10.2307/2111674}}&lt;/ref&gt; Secondly, an innovative policy instrument is proposed to supply that demand. Lastly, strategies are used such as team building, problem definition, and leadership by example to make certain that the innovation is placed on the agenda.&lt;ref name="MintromNorman"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Mintrom|first1=M|last2=Norman|first2=P|title=Policy Entrepreneurship and Policy Change|journal=Policy Studies Journal|date=2009|volume=37|issue=37|pages=649–67}}&lt;/ref&gt; Unlike a public intellect who strives to assert themselves into many different topics and be publicly vocal, a policy entrepreneur will focus on specific topics and possibly work behind the scenes with state and [[political elite]].

==Origin==
The term entrepreneur is derived from the French word entreprendre, i.e. to undertake. The French economist Jean-Baptiste Say first coined the term in 1803 and defined an entrepreneur as an individual who "shifts economic resources out of an area of lower and into an area of higher productivity and greater yield". Many decades later, scholars gradually have expanded the use of the idea of entrepreneurship and adapted the concept from business to the public sector. John Kingdon (1984) was one of the earliest scholars to apply the term entrepreneurs to the public sector; he first coined the term "policy entrepreneur" in his work Agendas, Alternatives and Public Policies.&lt;ref name="KINGDONBOOK" /&gt; This new term has been addressed in other works but hasn't been systematically used by other political scientists in theories of policy change.&lt;ref name="MintromNorman" /&gt;

==Multiple streams framework==
Kingdon’s multiple-streams framework (MSF) has been frequently used since the publication of his book Agendas, Alternatives and Public Policies in 1984.&lt;ref name="KINGDONBOOK" /&gt; His model is an interpretation of the garbage can model of organizational choice.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Cohen|first1=M. D.|last2=March|first2=J. G.|last3=Olsen|first3=J. P.|title=). Garbage can model of organizational choice|journal=Administrative Science Quarterly|date=1972|volume=17|issue=1|doi=10.2307/2392088}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a garbage can model, organization is seen as groups of choices that seek out problems, issues and feelings that look for decisions and solutions and people willing to solve them. The multiple-streams adaption of this sees that policies can be created by joining together problems, policies and politics, all of which are seen as decision aspects in a policy process.

Government agendas are created when problems are recognized that have viable solutions that will be politically correct to make at the time of decision making.&lt;ref name="KINGDONBOOK" /&gt; Kingdon recognizes when these three aspects join together using the term "policy window". When a policy window is recognized and open, there is a potential for policy making to happen. Policy entrepreneurs function at this time as the action takers who take advantage of these windows while they are open.&lt;ref name="Saetren" /&gt; In the problems stream, conditions are defined as problems based on how an individual values and believes in it and how much of an impact will happen through change. In the policy stream, ideas and solutions are formulated through policy ideas usually developed by specialists to an issue. Policy development has better chance of surviving implementation if it has support from various different communities effected by the policy. The politics stream focuses on different elements that will effect a policy such as national mood, efforts by the people to campaign for change and legislative turnover.&lt;ref name="ZahariadisSOlo"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Zahariadis|first1=Nikolaos|title=The Shield of Heracles: Multiple streams and the emotional endowment effect|date=November 2014|doi=10.1111/1475-6765.12072|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/1475-6765.12072/full|volume=54|journal=European Journal of Political Research|pages=466–481}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The multiple-streams framework is considered to provide the best conceptual insight in terms of the presence and influence of policy entrepreneurs and their role in emergence of policy windows&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Ness|first1=Erik Christian|title=The Politics of Determining Merit Aid Eligibility Criteria: An Analysis of the Policy Process|journal=The Journal of Higher Education|date=2010|volume=81|issue=1|pages=33–60|doi=10.1353/jhe.0.0080}}&lt;/ref&gt; by using the three 'streams' to explain the gap between a problem getting attention and the adoption of an impactful solution. Kingdon claims these are not linear processes, instead, these three streams are to be treated as separate streams, able to happen in any order. He states that these three streams must come together at the same time.&lt;ref name="CairneyZ"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Cairney|first1=Paul|last2=Zahariadis|first2=Nikolaos|title=Multiple streams analysis: A flexible metaphor presents an opportunity to operationalize agenda setting processes|date=2016|pages=1–21|url=https://paulcairney.files.wordpress.com/2013/10/cairney-zahariadis-multiple-streams-2016.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; These streams are that a window of opportunity must exist, as well as a viable solution, combined with the motivation and the opportunity of the policy makers to select the solution. Many opportunities for policy change open, but most of them close before anyone even has a chance to take advantage because the attention of the policy agenda shifts dramatically.&lt;ref name="CairneyZ" /&gt;

Kingdon applied this reasoning to the political system of the United States. Since policy makers do not have the time to devote to detailed policies, they give the responsibility to civil servants who consult with think tanks and interest groups to produce policy solutions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Cairney|first1=Paul|title=Policy Concepts in 1000 Words: Multiple Streams Analysis|date=October 2013|url=https://paulcairney.wordpress.com/2013/10/31/policy-concepts-in-1000-words-multiple-streams-analysis/}}&lt;/ref&gt; The likelihood of significant policy change is challenging to predict due to it requiring sustained attention, an acceptable solution, and some compromise of the political system. Building on Kingdon's work, Nikolaos Zahariadis defines it as a tool which explains how government policies are created with conditions of ambiguity.&lt;ref name="ZahariadisSOlo" /&gt;

Since 2000, Kingdon's book has been cited over 10,000 through Google Scholar and applied in over 1,900 times in peer reviewed articles.&lt;ref name="ZahariadisSOlo" /&gt;

==Idea to implementation==

In the multiple-streams frameworks, policy entrepreneurs do most of their work in the policy stream working on agenda setting ideas. The role of a policy entrepreneur is to first identify demand for innovation in the political landscape when a recognizable policy window is open. When this window is open, a policy entrepreneur has a limited amount of time to undergo the initial launch of proposing policy recommendations to supply the demand by utilizing their personal, network and institutional resources to take action on joining streams together on their idea through the policy stages. This is done by addressing issues and problems and coming up with solutions to them by creating policy alternatives into a product that they can present as a persuasive agenda that policy-makers should examine. They will implement persuasive strategies and techniques on the policy-makers to coerce their innovation onto the agenda. A successful policy entrepreneur will manage to get their issues onto a political agenda and potentially pass and influence a form of legislation that relates to their personal benefit. However, not every attempt will be successful. If unsuccessful, a policy entrepreneur may hold onto their agenda for a later time or even apply it to a different issue that they deem may work.&lt;ref name="Knaggard" /&gt;

==Characteristics==
These individuals have a credential that allows their opinions to be heard over others. This could be having expert knowledge on a topic or holding an important position of power in a corporation or special interest group that allows them to make decisions. A policy entrepreneur usually will have a large network of people with political influence that they utilize when pushing their idea forward. Persistence is essential for a policy entrepreneur to be successful. Many hours must be dedicated to their idea by giving speeches and talks, writing papers and speaking in front of government committees if they are to have success.&lt;ref name="KINGDONBOOK" /&gt;

Policy entrepreneurs are crucial actors in policy making, Kingdon himself explained that policy entrepreneurs are "advocates who are willing to invest their resources - time, energy, reputation, money - to promote a position in return for anticipated future gain in the form of material, purposive or solidary benefits".&lt;ref name="KINGDONBOOK" /&gt; Other political scientists have taken Kingdon's definition and expanded further. Michael Mintrom applied a [[Public policy|public policy perspective]] to the term stating, “they are individuals who through their creativity, strategy, networking, and persuasive argumentation are able to bring new policy ideas into the open and promote policy change".&lt;ref name="MintromSolo" /&gt; Years later, using a [[constructivism (international relations)|constructivist perspective]], Michael Mazarr added to this saying, “policy entrepreneurs can be seen as the human embodiment of the social construction of policy. Advocates determined, for one reason or another, to fight inertia, the bureaucracy, opposing interests, and anything else in their way to get the idea through the window [of opportunity] and into law or policy.”.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Mazarr|first1=Michael|title=The Iraq War and Agenda-Setting|journal=Foreign Policy Analysis|date=2007|volume=3|issue=1|pages=1–23|doi=10.1111/j.1743-8594.2007.00039.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reviews and criticisms==
Reviews of Agendas, Alternatives, and Public Policy display mixed opinions on the approaches and concepts created by Kingdon. Roger Cobb, former professor of political science at [[Brown University]] writes in an article for the [[Journal of Health Politics, Policy and Law]] that Kingdon's garbage can model approach is a completely random decision-making tool that lacks content. Cobb states that the greatest contribution of the garbage can model is the creation of new terms like policy entrepreneur that help give the sense of focus on policy problems but then argues that Kingdon himself may not fully believe in what he has created. He criticizes that Kingdon makes a legitimate arguments for structure by writing about “predictable policy windows” that are attributable to different political cycles but makes rations that would contradict his whole argument.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|date=1985|year=|title=Journal of Health Politics, Policy and Law|url=|journal=Journal of Health Politics, Policy and Law|volume=10|issue=2|pages=410–414|via=|last1=Cobb|first1=Roger|doi=10.1215/03616878-10-2-410}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Evelyn Brodkin, associate professor at [[The University of Chicago]] [[School of Social Service Administration]], writes in [[Political Science Quarterly]] that Kingdon's book provides a good analysis of how policy participants see their own role in influencing others, raising issue awareness and framing these issues for debate. She finds that his findings are beneficial for pursuing more empirical investigation and debate on different models of the agenda-setting process. In her criticism, Brodkin argues that the book fails to challenge criticisms of the pluralist theory that focus on discrepancies that illustrate how certain groups and issues systematically are excluded from the political process in which Kingdon's work is modelled on.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|date=1985|year=|title=Political Science Quarterly|url=|journal=Political Science Quarterly|volume=100|issue=1|pages=165–166|via=|last1=Brodkin|first1=Evelyn|doi=10.2307/2150882}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The frequent use of Kingdons agenda-setting framework in policy analysis is especially interesting because the book focuses solely on the United States. It can be argued that a framework developed exclusively on the basis of the examination of a single nation should not be able to generate useful insight in comparative research across the globe. Still, the MSF has been used in a large number of studies of subnational politics such as the European Union, the United Nations, and countries beyond the USA. Cairney and Zahariadis explain that this is because Kingdon's MSF possesses a language that is flexible enough to be relevant on a wide range of policy making processes.&lt;ref name="CairneyZ" /&gt; Its insights are universal enough to apply in most political systems.&lt;ref name="CairneyZ" /&gt;

Harald Sætren, professor at [[University of Bergen]] Department of Administration and Organization Theory, writes in [[Policy Sciences]] that one of the problems with the multiple-streams framework is that differing methods of finding issues and solutions potentially can effect how successful a policy entrepreneur can be in coupling policy streams.&lt;ref name="Saetren"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Sætren|first1=Harald|title=From controversial policy idea to successful program implementation: the role of the policy entrepreneur, manipulation strategy, program design, institutions and open policy windows in relocating Norwegian central agencies|journal=Policy Sciences|date=2016|volume=49|issue=1|pages=71–88|doi=10.1007/s11077-016-9242-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Policy entrepreneurs==

As of 2017, "policy entrepreneur" is not a recognized job position. John Kingdon's research consisted of case studies on 23 different people he deemed to be policy entrepreneurs.&lt;ref name="KINGDONBOOK" /&gt;

[[Isambard Kingdom Brunel]] is a mechanical engineer that engaged in the debate about whether paddle wheels or screw propellors were more powerful for moving boats. He tested this by building one of each and using them in a channel to see which would tug the hardest. The point of his story is that he was engaged on the ground and not just researching in a lab. Policy entrepreneurs need to be practically involved in testing their theories if they want their recommendations to be considered &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Isambard Kingdom Brunel|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/schools/primaryhistory/famouspeople/isambard_kingdom_brunel/|website=Primary History|publisher=BBC}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a study done by [[Mark Beeson]] and Diane Stone, [[Ross Garnaut]] was examined in a role of a policy entrepreneur. Garnaut was a highly decorated scholar, recognized economist who was also an ambassador to China and a prime ministerial advisor in Australia. In his role as advisor to [[Bob Hawke|Prime Minister Hawke]], he wrote to him about problems with fixed exchange rates and instituting labour-market reform. The government went on to implement a radical program of economic liberalisation that included addressing some of the issues Garnaut consulted on.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Beeson|first1=M|last2=Stone|first2=D|title=The Changing Fortunes of a Policy Entrepreneur: The Case of Ross Garnaut|journal=Australian Journal of Political Science, 48(1), 1-14.|date=2013|volume=48|issue=1|pages=1–14|doi=10.1080/10361146.2012.760526}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''probate sale''' is the process executed at a [[county court]] in the USA where the [[executor]] for the [[Estate (law)|estate]] of a deceased person sells property from the estate (typically [[real estate]]) in order to divide the property among the [[Beneficiary|beneficiaries]].  There is a personal representative of the estate who will determine if the real estate is going to be sold.  A personal representative is not required to use the services of a real estate broker.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Probate Sales of Real Property|url=http://www.car.org/legal/probate-folder/probate-sales-real-property/?view=Print&amp;url=http|publisher=CAR}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Determination of the value of real estate and other functions may need to be performed by a probate referee.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://probatereferees.org/memberlist.php|publisher=Ca Probate Referee Association}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Safety and Health in Mines Convention, 1995''' is  an [[International Labour Organization]] [[International Labour Organization#International Labour Conference|Convention]]. It was adopted at the 82nd International Labour Conference (ILC) of the International Labour Organization (ILO). The ILO is an agency under the [[United Nations]] that deals with international labor issues while promoting workers rights and opportunities. One of ILO’s goals is to hold annual labor conventions to create legally binding contracts for participating nations to ratify. During the Safety and Health in Mines Convention (C176), it was recognized that there are inherent [[mining#Safety|hazards in the mining workplace]], and a need for a convention was mandatory.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Nebehay|first1=Stephanie|title=Fatalities Go Unrecorded in Mining Industry: Experts|url=http://in.reuters.com/article/2010/10/11/idINIndia-52109020101011|website=Reuters|accessdate=17 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The outcome of the Convention is that miner’s health and safety is upheld and monitored through various actions involving the mining workplace. The responsible parties would be the government and employer of the countries that ratified the Convention. The laws outlined in the Convention ensure the health and safety of miners. The ILO adopted the Convention on June 22, 1995.

As of the end of 2015, 31 nations have ratified the Convention. The ILO requires any nation that ratifies a convention to be legally bound to its rules. Because ratifying the convention is optional, many prominent mining nations (including those notorious for mining incidents) have chosen not too participate.

It was established in 1995, with the preamble stating:
&lt;blockquote&gt;Recognizing that it is desirable to prevent any fatalities, injuries or ill health affecting workers or members of the public, or damage to the environment arising from mining operations, and&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;Having regard to the need for cooperation between the International Labour Organization, the [[World Health Organization]], the [[International Atomic Energy Agency]] and other relevant institutions and noting the relevant instruments, codes of practice, codes and guidelines issued by these organizations, and&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==The need for international mining regulation==
[[File:Underground mine Ales 3.jpg|thumb|right|alt=Underground mine.|The entrance to a coal mine in [[Alès|Alès, France.]] A large risk for miners is the possibility of cave-ins since tunnels are created as a result of mining. The Convention outlines guidelines to reduce the risk of these disasters from occurring.]]
Due to the hazardous conditions of the mining workplace, the Governing Body of the ILO recognized the need for a convention regarding the health and safety of miners. The ILO wanted to prevent fatalities, injuries and environmental damage as a result of mining.

===Hazards in the mining industry===
{{Main|Mining#Safety}}
Mining safety has always been a large issue in the overall working industry as numerous fatalities occur each year. As a result of the workplace being underground, the threat of harmful gases being trapped in the workplace is present. Additionally, if any miner were to become trapped due to a cave-in, the extraction process can be extremely difficult and hazardous. There is also a risk of having a secondary collapse since the necessary infrastructure to support the new topography would not be in place after an initial collapse.  This would result in additional trapped miners and rescue workers. Since miners are trapped in pockets of rock, the risk of an explosion and oxygen deprivation is high.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Mischner, Sara and Rothfeld, Paula|title=It's About Time: A Proposal to Establish a Specialized International Agency for CoalMiner Safety and Health|journal=ofstra Labor and Employment Law Journal|date=2009|volume=26|issue=2|page=12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As of 2001, more than 30 million people were employed in the mining industry. Despite that being only 1% of the world’s workforce, mining holds over 8% of workplace fatalities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite speech |last=Administration of William J. Clinton |date=September 9, 1999 |event=Message to the Senate Transmitting the Convention Concerning Safety and Health in Mines |location=Washington, D.C. }}&lt;/ref&gt; These statistics concerned the ILO, forcing them to hold a convention in order to decrease these statistics.

===Relevant pre-exiting conventions===
[[File:Health and Safety Mining Convention.jpg|thumb|left|400px|alt=Ratifying countries of c176.|The 29 Current Ratifying Countries of the Safety and Health in Mines Convention]]
Before the Safety and Health in Mines Convention, there were numerous other conventions that were slightly relevant to health and safety in the mines such as [[Safety and Health in Construction Convention, 1988|The Safety and Health in Construction Convention and Recommendation]], [[Prevention of Major Industrial Accidents Convention, 1993|The Prevention of Major Industrial Accidents Convention and Recommendation]], and [[Medical Examination of Young Persons (Underground Work) Convention, 1965|The Medical Examination of Young Persons (Underground Work) Convention]]. However, despite the many conventions that were relevant, there were not enough laws and conditions specifically laid out for miner’s health and safety. Therefore, the Safety and Health in Mines Convention was created.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=C176 - Safety and Health in Mines Convention, 1995 (No. 176)|url=http://www.ilo.org/dyn/normlex/en/f?p=NORMLEXPUB:12100:0::NO:12100:P12100_ILO_CODE:C176#A14|website=International Labour Organization}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==The Convention==
The document consists of 24 articles contained within 5 parts, preceded by a preamble.

*Preamble: Recognizes the dangerous conditions in the worlds mines, and notes multiple conventions that contain relevant laws in context with miners health and safety. 
*Part 1: Definitions. One article states a clear definition for the terms mine and employer.   
*Part 2: Scope and Means of Application. Four articles lay out who is responsible for upholding the Convention in ratifying countries. 
*Part 3: Preventative and Protective Measures At The Mine. This is divided into three sections, discussing the employers and workers duty to safety and health in mines. 
**Section A: Responsibilities of Employers. Seven articles state what the employer must do to minimize hazards and what to do in the event of one. 
**Section B: Rights And Duties of Workers and Their Representatives. Two articles discuss workers rights and their duty to comply with safety regulations.
**Section C: Cooperation. One article states the responsibility that miners and their employers have to work together to achieve health and safety in mines. 
*Part 4: Implementation. One article discusses the government’s requirement to provide inspection services and institute penalties for non-complying mines. 
*Part 5: Final Provisions. Eight articles describe the legality of ratifying the Convention, as well as how to denounce it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=C176 - Safety and Health in Mines Convention, 1995 (No. 176)|url=http://www.ilo.org/dyn/normlex/en/f?p=NORMLEXPUB:12100:0::NO:12100:P12100_ILO_CODE:C176|website=International Labour Organization}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Denouncing the Convention===
In Article 19 of Part 5, the process of denouncing the Convention is laid out. Countries are allowed to denounce the Convention only under certain circumstances. The article states that a country may denounce the Convention if they wish, only ten years after the Convention first came into force (in 1998). Therefore, in 2008 it was possible for any ratifying countries to eliminate the Convention and subsequently drop their enforcement of its laws. This would result in a major loss of support for miner’s health and safety, and even basic rights. As a result, no countries have yet to denounce the Convention.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Great Britain. Dept. for Education and Employment|title=International Labour Conference|date=1996|page=9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==United States ratification==
The 42nd President of The United States, [[Bill Clinton]], signed the Convention on January 5, 2001 with guidance from the Secretary of Labor, [[Alexis Herman]]. The United States was the 16th country to ratify the Convention. The United States ratification of the Convention showed its international support for miners who work in hazardous conditions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite speech |last=Administration of William J. Clinton |date=September 9, 1999 |event=Message to the Senate Transmitting the Convention Concerning Safety and Health in Mines |location=Washington, D.C. }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===United States mining regulation prior to the Convention===
[[File:Msha.jpg|thumb|left|alt=MSHA Inspection|Mining personnel are shown demonstrating rescue equipment to MSHA inspectors. These inspections are required under both the U.S. Mine Act as well as the Convention.]]
Since the Convention contains laws that are enforceable by the government, the United States would be held accountable for the all of the laws contained within it. However, the United States already enforces many laws relevant to the Convention. The [[Department of Labor]] has a division applicable to miners. This division, The [[Mine Safety and Health Administration]] (MSHA), is an agency that since 1977 has a mission to promote a safe and healthy workplace for miners by preventing injury and disease. The main method of doing this is by enforcing the Federal [[Mine Safety and Health Act of 1977]], known as the Mine Act. The Mine Act sets various standards intended to reduce fatal accidents and to minimize health hazards in an already dangerous occupation. Having the MSHA inspect every American mine accomplishes a part of the Mine Act. In addition, the MSHA handles all accident reporting and safety issues from miners.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=MSHA Frequently Asked Questions|url=http://www.msha.gov/faq/faqhome.htm|website=Mine Safety and Health Administration|accessdate=17 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The disease black lung, which largely affects miners, is being worked on by the MSHA to have it diminished in the United States. Similarly, the laws outlined in the Convention are aimed at lowering the amount of individuals with disease obtained from the mining workplace.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Main|first1=Joseph|title=Historic Step Forward in Effort to End Black Lung Disease|url=. http://www.msha.gov/endblacklung/|website=MSHA|accessdate=17 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Overlap with The Mine Act===
As a result of the already implemented MSHA and the Mine Act in the United States, it was not clear whether or not the Convention ratification would make a large impact in the various mining health and safety laws. A tripartite panel consisting of representatives covering American government, labor and business was held. They compared the laws from the Convention and the laws set in place by the Mine Safety and Health Act of 1977. They concluded that the Convention could be signed by the president and ratified without the introduction of any new laws. This was due to the MSHA already enforcing all of the laws stated within the Convention.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite speech |last=Administration of William J. Clinton |date=September 9, 1999 |event=Message to the Senate Transmitting the Convention Concerning Safety and Health in Mines |location=Washington, D.C. }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Bill Clinton signing the Convention in 2001===
Even though the ratification would not introduce any new laws, Bill Clinton signed the Convention in 2001. The reason for the ratification was a political and economic strategy. The United States had an interest in holding other countries accountable for miner’s health and safety. By ratifying the Convention, the United States could reach out to other countries that have ratified it for failing to comply. If the United States had not ratified the Convention, it would be difficult to task other countries for failure to enforce the applicable laws.
&lt;ref&gt;{{cite speech |last=Clinton |first=Bill |date=September 9, 1999 |event=Statement on the Convention Concerning Safety and Health in Mines |location=Washington, D.C. }}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to holding other nations accountable, the ratification would make the United States mining industry more competitive in the global economy. For example, if a coal buyer were only interested in doing business with mines that had the Convention signed, the United States would be at a loss without having it ratified.

==Turkey's ratification==
[[File:Soma mine disaster12.JPG|thumb|right|alt=Soma mine disaster|Rescue effort after the Soma mining disaster]]

===Soma mine disaster===
At least [[Soma mine disaster|301 miners were killed in Soma, Turkey]] after an explosion sent poisonous gasses throughout the mine. More than 100 workers survived the explosion and subsequent gas, but were killed as a result of the mine collapsing onto them. Backlash against the government and the mine operator was strong and negligence investigations ensued. The general manager and the operations manager were held on suspicion of neglect, which caused numerous deaths. During the Soma disaster, a commission from the International Labor Organization was sent to discuss miner’s health and safety with Turkish officials. The Turkish Labor minister, Faruk Celik, claimed that strict laws were already in place in Turkey. In addition, Turkey claimed to be in full compliance with European Union standards and had laws even more advanced than the ILO Convention.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Mining disaster kills 300 in Turkey|journal=TCE: The Chemical Engineer|date=2014|volume=876|pages=22–23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===IndustriALL push for ratification===
[[IndustriALL Global Union|IndustriALL]], a global union that represents 50 million workers from 146 countries, wanted Turkey to swiftly ratify the Convention following the Soma disaster. One of their goals as a global union is to make the worlds mines safer. They claim that the best way to accomplish this is by having countries ratify the Convention and fully implement the laws and safety regulations contained within it. In addition, they state that the first priority of mining is to promote the safety and well being of miners. By favoring profit first, it should be considered criminal behavior that should be intolerable.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Ermenek Mining Accident: Call to Sign ILO Convention 176.|url=http://www.industriall-europe.eu/news/list2.asp?stid=253.|accessdate=October 29, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Turkish Parliament approves the Convention===
Following the Soma disaster, debates occurred in Turkey as to whether or not the government was protecting its miners from disasters like this. Turkey was largely hesitant to begin ratification processes due to employer backlash of the cost to uphold to the Conventions rules and regulations. In the end, the Turkish Parliament’s General Assembly on December 4, 2014 decided to formally adopt the Convention. Turkey notice of ratification of the treaty was deposited on 23 March 2015.

However, this has not been a perfect resolution. Many employers are unable to cover the cost of the resulting changes. As a result, many companies have been forced to lay off workers and shut down mines.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Ankara|title=Turkish Parliament approves ILO’s mining safety convention|url=http://www.turkishweekly.net/news/176790/turkish-parliament-approves-ilo-s-mining-safety-convention.html|website=Hurriyet Daily News|accessdate=10 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Preventing black lung disease==
[[File:Fan, Virginia Coal Mine Ventillation.png|thumb|left|alt=Mining venitlation.|A large fan is shown blowing fresh air into a mine near [[Richlands, Virginia]]. Such equipment is required under the Convention, and reduces the incidences of black lung in miners.]]
Pneumoconiosis, also known as black lung, is a fatal health illness present in the mining industry caused by prolonged exposure to mine dust. In the United States, black lung has caused 76,000 deaths since 1968. So far, 45 billion dollars have been spent in federal compensation towards miners and their dependents in the United States. Despite the large economic and death toll, black lung is entirely preventable. A mine that is equipped with good ventilation and newer tools is at a much lower (or nonexistent) risk for miners contracting black lung.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Mischner, Sara and Rothfeld, Paula|title=It's About Time: A Proposal to Establish a Specialized International Agency for CoalMiner Safety and Health|journal=ofstra Labor and Employment Law Journal|date=2009|volume=26|issue=2|page=12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The risk of black lung in The United States has been nearly eliminated today. On the other hand, China (which has yet to ratify the Convention) had a total of 750,000 cases in 2013. That number is likely larger, but reporting is much less common in smaller Chinese mines. Ventilation, replacing dusty and hazardous air with fresh air, is the best way to prevent miners from contracting black lung.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Phillips|first1=Ari|title=Black Lung Escalates In China Just As Coal Demand Starts To Slow|url=http://thinkprogress.org/climate/2014/12/15/3603573/china-black-lung-epidemic-coal/|website=Climate Progress|accessdate=15 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Article 7 of the Convention requires that employers take measures to minimize the risk of disease. This includes having good ventilation in all locations of the mine in which miners come in contact with. The Convention also requires that the working environment is monitored for hazards that can induce disease. Finally, article 5 requires that countries publish statistics on occupational disease (included black lung).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=C176 - Safety and Health in Mines Convention, 1995 (No. 176)|url=http://www.ilo.org/dyn/normlex/en/f?p=NORMLEXPUB:12100:0::NO::P12100_INSTRUMENT_ID:312321|website=International Labour Organization|accessdate=14 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Issues with the Convention==
[[File:Coal Miner.JPG|thumb|right|alt=A Chinese coal worker.|A coal miner working in [[Xingtai|Xingtai, China]]. China is the world's leader in coal production. ]]The goal of the Convention is to create a standard that can be used for any ratifying nations to promote the health and safety of miners. It supports the notion for countries to create the proper agencies to regulate the safety and health of miner’s and implement standards. However, many prominent mining countries have yet to ratify the Convention. In addition, many ratifying nations differ in the amount of effort put into the relevant agencies.

Currently there are five main developed countries that are prominent in the mining industry. Only two of these five have ratified the Convention (The United States and Germany). There are a number of developing nations that also largely partake in mining. Despite this, only a fraction have signed the Convention. China, the worlds leading coal producer, has yet to ratify the Convention. China also has the most dangerous track record of miner’s health and safety (based on number of fatalities).

Apart from the countries that haven't ratified it, the effectiveness of the Convention relies on the strictness of the government. The ratifying nations are ultimately responsible for creating the relevant agencies and enforcing the standards laid out in the Convention.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Mischner, Sara and Rothfeld, Paula|title=It's About Time: A Proposal to Establish a Specialized International Agency for CoalMiner Safety and Health|journal=Hofstra Labor and Employment Law Journal|date=2009|volume=26|issue=2|page=12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===European Union strengthening of the Convention===
In 2008, the [[European Commission]] released a [[Recommendation (European Union)|Recommendation]] for all EU members to ratify recent conventions from the ILO, including Convention 176. Similar to the United States, many EU member States have laws already in place that would match or in some cases surpass the laws laid out in the Convention. However, the Recommendations laid out by the Commission did not just ask for the ratification of the various conventions. The Commission recognized the notion that governments can ratify, yet not enforce the Convention fully. Therefore, it asked for the conventions rules to be strengthened and made certain that a supervisory system was in place to monitor the effectiveness of the conventions enforcement. The Recommendation was released despite opposition from some EU nations claiming that the funding to the ILO should be lowered or in some cases dropped.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=EU renewed social agenda – ratification and implementation of ILO Conventions|url=http://www.tuc.org.uk/international-issues/europe/ec-social-agenda/eu-renewed-social-agenda-%E2%80%93-ratification-and|website=The Trades Union Congress|accessdate=13 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Ratifications==

As of the end of 2015, 31 countries have ratified the convention.

This figure combines Sony/ATV's 2.3 million songs and the 2.06 million songs of [[EMI Music Publishing]] it administers.

The company was formed in 1955 as [[Associated Television]] (ATV), a [[United Kingdom|British]] [[television]] broadcaster and production studio. ATV acquired [[Northern Songs]], publisher of the [[Lennon–McCartney]] song catalogue, in 1969. Entertainer [[Michael Jackson]] purchased ATV Music in 1985 for $47.5 million. Ten years later in December 1995, Jackson agreed to merge the company with Sony Music Publishing, a  [[Sony|Sony Corporation]] division, to form a 50:50 joint venture, which would become Sony/ATV Music Publishing. As ATV Music was worth more, Michael Jackson received an additional $110 million. At the time, about two thirds of ATV's value was tied to the Beatles' songs.

In 2012, an investor consortium led by Sony/ATV Music Publishing acquired [[EMI Music Publishing]] for approximately $2.2 billion,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/emi-music-publishing-sold-sony-atv-estate-michael-jackson-343848 | work=The Hollywood Reporter | first=Shirley | last=Halperin | title=Sold!

Sony/ATV and EMI Music Publishing operate as one company, with Sony/ATV administering the catalogue of EMI Publishing. Subsequent to the acquisition, Sony/ATV became the largest music publishing administrator in the world, with a library of over 3 million songs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.sonyatv.com/en|title=Sony/ATV|website=Sonyatv.com|accessdate=December 12, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In October 2018, the [[European Commission]] approved Sony/ATV's outright acquisition of [[EMI Music Publishing]].

== History of ATV ==

[[Associated Television]] (ATV) was a British television broadcasting company founded in 1955 by [[Lew Grade]]. Over the next two decades, ATV expanded through acquisitions to become an entertainment conglomerate with business lines in the record industry, music publishing and film production.

ATV entered the music industry in 1958 when it acquired 50% of [[Pye Records]], a British record company.&lt;ref&gt;"Pye Records Deal" ''[[Financial Times]]'' London 23 October 1958: 1&lt;/ref&gt; ATV expanded into music publishing in 1966 when it acquired 50% of New World Music and Jubilee Music, subsidiaries of [[Chappell &amp; Co.]]&lt;ref&gt;"ATV Goes into Music Publishing" ''Financial Times'' London 3 June 1966: 9&lt;/ref&gt; ATV also acquired the other 50% of Pye Records, making it a wholly owned subsidiary of ATV, including Pye Record's publishing subsidiary Welbeck Music.&lt;ref&gt;"ATV Buying up Pye Records for £2.1m" ''Financial Times'' London 13 July 1966: 1&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Lennon-McCartney.JPG|thumb|250px|John Lennon and Paul McCartney attempted to purchase a controlling interest in Northern Songs in 1969]]
ATV acquired [[Northern Songs]], publisher of the [[Lennon–McCartney]] song catalogue, in 1969.&lt;ref name="guest 8"&gt;Guest (2006) p8&lt;/ref&gt; The catalog featured almost every song written by [[John Lennon]] and [[Paul McCartney]]. Northern Songs was co-owned by Lennon, McCartney, [[Brian Epstein]] and [[Dick James]], who owned a controlling interest. In 1969, James offered to sell his shares to ATV. Lennon and McCartney then attempted to gain a controlling interest in the company.&lt;ref name="guest 8"/&gt; Their bid to gain control, part of a long and acrimonious fight, failed. The financial clout of Grade, their adversary in the bidding war, ensured that the songs written by the two Beatles passed into the control of ATV.&lt;ref name="guest 8"/&gt;

In 1970, ATV formed a joint publishing venture with [[Don Kirshner|Kirshner Entertainment]], called ATV-Kirshner Music.&lt;ref&gt;"ATV,Kirshner Organize Global Publishing Co.; Maclen In Fold" ''Billboard'' August 22, 1970: 7&lt;/ref&gt; The partnership agreement expired at the end of 1972 at which time ATV Music was formed to manage all of ATV's publishing interests, including Northern Songs. ATV Music remained a successful organization in the music industry throughout the 1970s, largely due to the performance of Northern Songs. ATV Music also entered into co-publishing agreements with Lennon and McCartney, whose contract with Northern Songs expired in 1973.

While ATV Music was successful, its parent company, now known as Associated Communications Corporation (ACC) began experiencing financial difficulties. From 1978 to 1981, ACC's profits declined due to losses in its film division, and share prices dropped dramatically. The main television arm of ATV lost its government-granted license in its then-current form and was restructured into [[ITV Central|Central Independent Television]]. In 1981, Grade entertained offers for Northern Songs, drawing interest from several bidders. McCartney, with Lennon's widow [[Yoko Ono]], offered £21 million but the offer was declined by Grade who decided not to sell Northern Songs separately after other suitors, including [[Sony Music#1938–1990: Columbia/CBS Records|CBS Songs]], [[EMI Music Publishing]], [[Warner Communications]], [[Paramount Pictures]] and [[Martin Bandier|the Entertainment Co.]] showed interest in buying ATV Music as a whole.&lt;ref&gt;Moore, John.

"Beatle Catalog Hopefuls Hit 'All Or Nothing' Snag" ''Billboard'' December 12, 1981: 45&lt;/ref&gt;

Meanwhile, Australian businessman [[Robert Holmes à Court]] had been acquiring shares of ACC and launched a takeover bid in earnest in January 1982. Grade resigned as chairman and was replaced by Holmes à Court who successfully acquired a controlling interest in the company.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://adbonline.anu.edu.au/biogs/A170543b.htm |title=Holmes à Court, Michael Robert Hamilton (1937–1990)|work=Australian Dictionary of Biography Online Edition|publisher=Melbourne University Publishing, The Australian National University |accessdate= January 2, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; After Holmes à Court assumed control of ACC, ATV Music was no longer for sale.&lt;ref&gt;"West Coast Publishers Keep Things Happening" ''[[Record World]]'' 27 February 1982: 8&lt;/ref&gt;

== Sale of ATV Music to Michael Jackson in 1985 ==
[[File:Michael 1988 by himself.jpg|right|thumb|150px|Michael Jackson acquired ATV Music in 1985 and merged it with Sony a decade later.]]
During this time, American singer Michael Jackson was recording "[[Say Say Say]]" for Paul McCartney's ''[[Pipes of Peace]]'' album. Jackson stayed at the home of McCartney and his wife [[Linda McCartney|Linda]] during the recording sessions, becoming friendly with both. One evening while at the dining table, McCartney brought out a thick, bound notebook displaying all the songs to which he owned the publishing rights. Jackson grew more excited as he examined the pages. He inquired about how to buy songs and what the songs were used for.&lt;ref name="hilburn"&gt;{{cite news |title=The long and winding road |author=Hilburn, Robert |url=http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/news/music/la-et-hilburn-michael-jackson-sep22,0,540678,full.story |newspaper=Los Angeles Times |date=September 22, 1985}}&lt;/ref&gt; McCartney explained that music publishing was a way to make big money. Jackson replied by telling McCartney that he would buy The Beatles' songs one day. McCartney laughed, saying "Great. Good joke."&lt;ref name="tara 333–334"&gt;Taraborrelli (2004) p333–334&lt;/ref&gt;

Jackson was first informed that the ATV catalog was up for sale in September 1984 by his attorney, [[John Branca]], who had put together Jackson's earlier catalogue acquisitions. Warned of the competition he would face in buying such popular songs, Jackson remained resolute in his decision to purchase them.&lt;ref name="tara 335–338"&gt;Taraborrelli (2004) p335–338&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="hilburn" /&gt; Branca approached McCartney's attorney to query whether the Beatle was planning to bid. The attorney stated he wasn't; it was "too pricey."&lt;ref name="tara 335–338"/&gt;&lt;ref name="jdoyle pophis"&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.pophistorydig.com/?p=2517|title=Michael &amp; McCartney, 1990s–2009|author=Doyle, Jack|date=July 7, 2009|work=The Pop History Dig}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Bert Reuter, who negotiated the sale of ATV Music for Holmes à Court, "We had given Paul McCartney first right of refusal but Paul didn't want it at that time."&lt;ref name="ch7news"&gt;{{Cite episode | title =Michael Jackson 1958–2009 | url =https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3htpIVyUtec | accessdate=January 9, 2010 |series = Today Tonight| network = [[Seven Network]]| station = [[TVW]]| airdate = 2009-06-25| minutes = Coverage of the sale of ATV Music at 2:36}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lennon's widow, [[Yoko Ono]] had been contacted as well but also did not enter bidding.&lt;ref name="jdoyle pophis"/&gt;

The competitors in the 1984 sale of ATV Music included [[Charles Koppelman]] and [[Marty Bandier]]'s New York-based the Entertainment Co., [[Virgin Records]], New York real estate tycoon [[Samuel J. LeFrak]], and financier Charles Knapp. On November 20, 1984, Jackson sent a bid of $46&amp;nbsp;million to Holmes à Court. Branca suggested the amount of the bid after having spent time evaluating the earnings of the catalogue and learning of another bid for $39&amp;nbsp;million. Jackson was only interested in the music [[copyrights]], but the package also included buildings, a recording studio and studio equipment. The two sides signed a non-binding [[Memorandum of understanding|memorandum]] of mutual interest in December 1984 and Jackson's team began a four-month process of verifying ATV Music's legal documents, financial reports, and every significant composition in the nearly 4000-song catalog.&lt;ref name="hilburn" /&gt;

The two sides began drafting contracts in January 1985 and follow-through meetings began on March 16. Jackson's team described the negotiations as frustrating, with frequent shifts of position by the seller. One Holmes à Court representative described the negotiations as a "game of poker". Jackson's team thought they had reached a deal several times, but new bidders would enter the picture or they would encounter new areas of debate. The prospective deal went through eight drafts. In May 1985, Jackson's team walked away from negotiations after having spent hundreds of hours and over $1&amp;nbsp;million. In June 1985, they learned Koppelman/Bandier had made a tentative agreement with Holmes à Court to buy the catalog for $50&amp;nbsp;million.&lt;ref name="hilburn" /&gt;

But in early August, Holmes à Court contacted Jackson and talks resumed. Jackson only raised his bid to $47.5&amp;nbsp;million, but he had the advantage of being able to close the deal faster, having completed [[due diligence]] of ATV Music prior to any formal agreement.&lt;ref name="hilburn" /&gt; He also agreed to visit Australia as a guest of Holmes à Court and appear on the [[Channel Seven Perth Telethon]].&lt;ref name="hilburn" /&gt;&lt;ref name="ch7news" /&gt; Holmes à Court included some more assets and agreed to establish a scholarship in Jackson's name at a U.S. university.&lt;ref name="hilburn" /&gt; Branca closed the deal and purchased ATV Music on Jackson's behalf for $47.5&amp;nbsp;million on August 10. 1985.&lt;ref name="tara 335–338"/&gt;&lt;ref name="hilburn" /&gt; In October 1985, Jackson fulfilled his contract provision to visit [[Perth, Western Australia]] and appear on the telethon, where he spoke briefly and met with two children.&lt;ref name="hilburn" /&gt;&lt;ref name="ch7news"/&gt;

The only Beatles song in the Northern Songs catalog that was excluded from the sale was "[[Penny Lane]]", the rights to which were gifted by Holmes à Court to his then-teenage daughter Catherine before the sale, as it was her favorite Beatles song.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Forde|first1=Eamonn|title=The long and winding road: how Paul McCartney is clawing back his catalogue|url=https://www.theguardian.com/music/musicblog/2016/mar/21/paul-mccartney-reclaims-composition-rights-beatles|website=The Guardian|accessdate=18 June 2017|date=21 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=(www.dw.com)|first1=Deutsche Welle|title=Sony secures another stake in Michael Jackson's music venture {{!}} Business {{!}} DW {{!}} 15.03.2016|url=http://www.dw.com/en/sony-secures-another-stake-in-michael-jacksons-music-venture/a-19117580|website=DW.COM|accessdate=18 June 2017|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Reactions to the acquisition ===

In an analysis of the acquisition, the ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'' noted that if "[[Yesterday (Beatles song)|Yesterday]]" were to earn $100,000 a year in royalties, the Lennon estate and McCartney would divide 50% of the income; $25,000 each. The publisher, Jackson, would receive the other 50%; $50,000. It was mentioned that "Yesterday" probably earns more than $100,000 a year. The publisher would also control the use of the song in films, commercials and stage productions.&lt;ref name="tara 335–338"/&gt;&lt;ref name="hilburn" /&gt; Jackson went on to use the Beatles' songs in numerous commercials, feeling that it would enable a new generation of fans to enjoy the music. McCartney, who had himself used the [[Buddy Holly]] song catalogue in commercials, felt saddened.&lt;ref name="tara 335–338"/&gt; Privately, Jackson was reported to have expressed exasperation at McCartney's attitude; he felt that the musician should have paid for the songs he had written.&lt;ref name="tara 335–338"/&gt; At the time, McCartney was one of the richest entertainers in the world, with a net worth of $560&amp;nbsp;million and a royalty income of $41&amp;nbsp;million.&lt;ref name="tara 335–338"/&gt; Jackson stated, "If he didn't want to invest $47.5&amp;nbsp;million in his own songs, then he shouldn't come crying to me now."&lt;ref name="tara 335–338"/&gt;

Appearing on the ''[[Late Show with David Letterman]]'' shortly after Jackson died in 2009, McCartney spoke about Jackson's acquisition of the Beatles songs and the impact of it on their relationship:&lt;ref name="mcca lettrmn"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1kYDdBWESQw |title=Paul Mccartney on David Letterman – Part 2 of 3 | date=July 17, 2009 | accessdate=November 19, 2010 |format=YouTube video |work=At 3:25 McCartney talks about Jackson acquiring the Beatles songs}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;And which was, you know, that was cool, somebody had to get it, I suppose. What happened actually was then I started to ring him up. I thought, OK, here's the guy historically placed to give Lennon–McCartney a good deal at last. Cuz we got signed when we were 21 or something in a back alley in Liverpool. And the deal, it's remained the same, even though we made this company the most famous… hugely successful. So I kept thinking, it was time for a raise. Well you would, you know. [David Letterman: Yes, I think so.] And so it was great. But I did talk to him about it. But he kind of blanked me on it. He kept saying, "That's just business Paul." You know. So, "yeah it is", and waited for a reply. But we never kind of got to it. And I thought, mm.... So we kind of drifted apart. It was no big bust up. We kind of drifted apart after that. But he was a lovely man, massively talented, and we miss him.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Ono was pleased that Jackson had acquired Northern Songs and called it a "blessing".&lt;ref name="tara 335–338"/&gt; Speaking in November 1990, Ono stated, "Businessmen who aren't artists themselves wouldn't have the consideration Michael has. He loves the songs. He's very caring."&lt;ref name="tara 335–338"/&gt; She added that if she and McCartney were to own the songs, there would certainly be arguments. Ono explained that neither she nor McCartney needed that. "If Paul got the songs, people would have said, 'Paul finally got John.' And if I got them, they'd say, 'Oh, the [[dragon lady]] strikes again.'"&lt;ref name="tara 335–338"/&gt;

== The Sony/ATV years ==

We have been working on this for over a year and, now, with the two of us together, the sky is our only limit.|source=Michael Jackson, 1995.&lt;ref name="Michael Jackson and Sony enter joint publishing venture valued at $600 million" /&gt;}}

=== Merger of ATV with Sony Music Publishing in 1995 ===
Michael Jackson record label's owner, US-based media group [[CBS Corporation]], was negotiating the sale of its record division at the end of the 1980s. [[Sony]], which sought to diversify into music, films and games, acquired CBS Records Inc. in January 1988, then changed its name to Sony Music Entertainment Inc. in January 1991 (then Sony Music Holdings Inc. in December 2008). Looking for further opportunities, Sony aimed to expand its music publishing interests and offered Jackson $110&amp;nbsp;million for a 50% stake in a combined ATV and Sony Music Publishing joint venture. Following hurriedly arranged meetings and disagreements over the selling price, a deal was sealed by Jackson during a concert in Tokyo.&lt;ref name="guest 12–13"&gt;Guest (2006) pp12–13&lt;/ref&gt; Jackson had essentially sold half ownership of the Beatles' and others' songs for a large profit.&lt;ref name="guest 12–13" /&gt; Jackson's own songs, grouped in the Mijac catalog, were not included in the deal.&lt;ref name="Michael Jackson and Sony enter joint publishing venture valued at $600 million"&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=MDsDAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA36&amp;dq=Sony/ATV+%22michael+jackson%22&amp;lr=&amp;num=100&amp;as_brr=3&amp;as_pt=ALLTYPES&amp;ei=-JHYSY-XJYbEzQSywKCgCg|title=Michael Jackson and Sony enter joint publishing venture valued at $600&amp;nbsp;million|date=November 27, 1995|publisher=''[[Jet (magazine)|Jet]]''|accessdate=April 6, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The new company was named Sony/ATV Music Publishing and became the second largest music publisher in the world.&lt;ref name="guest 12–13" /&gt; Michael P. Schulhof, President and CEO of Sony Corporation of America, welcomed the merger and praised Jackson for his efforts in the venture. "Michael Jackson is not only the most successful entertainer in history; he is also an astute businessman. Michael understands the importance of copyrights and the role they play in the introduction to new technologies."&lt;ref name="Michael Jackson and Sony enter joint publishing venture valued at $600 million" /&gt; He added that Jackson recognises Sony's "leadership in developing and realizing new technologies that serve to expand the creative horizon of artists such as himself".&lt;ref name="Michael Jackson and Sony enter joint publishing venture valued at $600 million" /&gt; Administrative expertise was provided by Sony, who installed Paul Russell as chairman. Jackson was a company director and attended board meetings regularly.&lt;ref name="guest 12–13" /&gt; As each party in the arrangement held the power of veto, both sides would have to agree on a decision before it could be made. If neither party agreed on a decisions, they would not be implemented.&lt;ref name="guest 12–13" /&gt;

In 2006, Sony gained operational control of Sony/ATV and obtained an option to buy half of Jackson's stake in the company at any time for a fixed price of $250 million.&lt;ref name="WSJ20100621"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424052748703438604575315364195884770|title=Jackson Estate Steers to Next Challenge: Loan Refinancing|last=Smith|first=Ethan|date=June 21, 2010|accessdate=2010-08-05|publisher=Wall Street Journal}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="NYT20090720"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2009/07/20/business/20fund.html|title=Jackson Assets Draw the Gaze of Wall Street|date=July 19, 2009|accessdate=2010-08-05|publisher=New York Times}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Billboard20090815"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sonyatv.com/index.php/news/549|title=The Company To Watch|date=August 15, 2009|publisher=Billboard|accessdate=2010-08-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Catalog acquisitions (2001–2007) ===
Sony/ATV Music Publishing continued to acquire song catalogues in the 21st century.

In November 2001, the company signed country singer Tony Martin to an exclusive songwriting and co-publishing deal. Through the deal, they acquired Martin's Baby Mae Music catalog of 600 songs, which includes [[Joe Diffie]]'s "[[Third Rock from the Sun (album)|Third Rock from the Sun]]" and [[Jeff Carson]]'s "[[Not on Your Love]]".&lt;ref name="Sony/ATV Music Publishing signs Tony Martin"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.bizjournals.com/nashville/stories/2001/11/19/daily12.html|title=Sony/ATV Music Publishing signs Tony Martin|date=November 20, 2001|publisher=''[[Nashville Business Journal]]''|accessdate=April 8, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In July 2002, Sony/ATV Music Publishing bought veteran country music publisher [[Acuff-Rose Music]] for $157&amp;nbsp;million. The venture included music publishing rights to 55,000 country music songs, including the music of [[Hank Williams]], [[The Everly Brothers]] and [[Roy Orbison]],&lt;ref name="Jackson made Exeter FC director"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/music/2088831.stm|title=Jackson made Exeter FC director|date=July 3, 2002|publisher=BBC|accessdate=April 8, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="In Brief: Clinic, Alanis"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/artists/clinic/articles/story/5934800/in_brief_clinic_alanis|title=In Brief: Clinic, Alanis|date=July 2, 2002|publisher=''[[Rolling Stone]]''|accessdate=April 8, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[master recording]]s of the defunct label [[Hickory Records]].

Another company acquisition was made in 2007, when Sony/ATV purchased [[Famous Music]], a music publishing business with song catalogue of more than 125,000 songs including "[[Moon River]]" and "[[Footloose (song)|Footloose]]", for $370 million. The deal, sought by [[Viacom]], included the assumption of around $30&amp;nbsp;million of debt. The song catalogue also includes the hits of [[Eminem]], [[Akon]], [[Linda Perry]], [[Björk]], [[Shakira]] and [[Beck]], as well as music from films released by Viacom divisions [[Paramount Pictures]] (which had founded Famous Music in 1928) and [[DreamWorks Pictures]].&lt;ref name="Viacom sells Famous Music to Sony/ATV"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.usatoday.com/money/economy/2007-05-30-2986621890_x.htm|title=Viacom sells Famous Music to Sony/ATV|date=May 30, 2007|accessdate=April 8, 2009|publisher=''[[USA Today]]''}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Jackson buys Eminem rights"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/music/2007/may/31/news.eminem|title=Jackson buys Eminem rights|last=Swash|first=Rosie|date=May 31, 2007|accessdate=April 8, 2009|publisher=''The Guardian''|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Notable administration and distribution deals ===
Digital [[sheet music]] provider Musicnotes.com announced in June 2006 that it had signed a long-term distribution agreement with Sony/ATV Music Publishing.

On June 27, 2017, Sony/ATV agreed to administer the music publishing rights of French motion picture company [[EuropaCorp]], soon after acquiring 1,500 music copyrights from the studio.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.musicbusinessworldwide.com/sonyatv-buys-europa-music-catalogue-16-5m|title=Sony/ATV buys EuropaCorp music catalogue for $16.5m - Music Business Worldwide|date=June 27, 2017|website=Musicbusinessworldwide.com|accessdate=December 12, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other major studios that rely on Sony/ATV's administration include Paramount, [[Nickelodeon]], [[MTV Networks]], [[Showtime (TV network)|Showtime]], [[CBS]], and DreamWorks (all since the Famous Music acquisition); [[Sony Pictures]], [[20th Century Fox]], [[A+E Networks]], [[Endemol Shine Group]], [[Hit Entertainment]], [[ITV Studios]], and [[Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://lbbonline.com/companies/sonyatv-music-publishing|title=Sony/ATV Music Publishing - LBBOnline|website=Lbbonline.com|accessdate=December 12, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Takeover of EMI Publishing in 2012===
In November 2011, [[Citigroup]] announced a deal to sell EMI in two pieces. Recorded music went to [[Vivendi]]'s [[Universal Music Group]] for $1.9&amp;nbsp;billion. [[EMI Music Publishing]] went to a Sony/ATV-led consortium for around $2.2&amp;nbsp;billion.&lt;ref&gt;Joshua R.

While Sony/ATV acquired about 30% of EMI Publishing, it put up a much lower cash contribution. In exchange, it agreed to administer the entire catalog. Sony/ATV became the largest music publisher administrator company in the world with more than 3 million songs&lt;ref name="Sony Closes Its Acquisition of EMI Music Publishing"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://articles.washingtonpost.com/2012-06-29/business/35460661_1_sony-mubadala-development-music-group-and-bmg|title=Sony Closes Its Acquisition of EMI Music Publishing|last=ElBoghdady|first=Dina|date=June 29, 2012|accessdate=January 25, 2013|publisher=Washington Post}}&lt;/ref&gt; and estimated revenues of over US$1.25&amp;nbsp;billion per year.&lt;ref name="Sony Plans To Cut 326 EMI Music Publishing Jobs Over Two Years"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.billboard.biz/bbbiz/industry/publishing/sony-plans-to-cut-326-emi-music-publishing-1006800752.story|title=Sony Plans To Cut 326 EMI Music Publishing Jobs Over Two Years|last=Christman|first=Ed|date=April 18, 2012|publisher=[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]|accessdate=January 25, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since 2012, Sony/ATV has administered Jackson's other publishing firm, Mijac, which includes songs written by Jackson himself (and others), and which used to be administered by competitor [[Warner/Chappell Music]].&lt;ref name="Michael Jackson's Mijac Music Catalog Moves to Sony/ATV"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.billboard.biz/bbbiz/others/michael-jackson-s-mijac-music-catalog-moves-1007863812.story|title=Michael Jackson's Mijac Music Catalog Moves to Sony/ATV|last=Christman|first=Ed|date=August 20, 2012|publisher=[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]|accessdate=January 25, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Acquisition of Jackson's stake by Sony in 2016 ===
On October 8, 2015, it was reported that Sony would sell its 50% stake in Sony/ATV Music Publishing to the Michael Jackson Estate.&lt;ref name="International Business Times"&gt;[http://www.ibtimes.co.uk/sony-plans-sell-its-stake-sony-atv-music-publishing-1523032 Sony plans to sell its stake in Sony/ATV Music Publishing] ibtimes.co.uk October 8, 2015, Retrieved on November 14, 2016&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Los Angeles Times"&gt;[http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/envelope/cotown/la-et-ct-sony-atv-music-20151017-story.html Sony/ATV sale expected to attract rivals, private equity] Ryan Faughnder latimes.com October 17, 2015, Retrieved on December 29, 2917&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Rolling Stones"&gt;[https://www.rollingstone.com/music/news/sony-michael-jackson-estate-in-talks-for-transfer-of-massive-catalog-20151009 Sony, Michael Jackson Estate in Talks for Transfer of Massive Catalog] Steve Knopper rollingstone.com October 9, 2015, Retrieved on December 29, 2017&lt;/ref&gt; Contrary to those reports, in October 2015, it was reported that a clause had been triggered in the agreement between Sony and the estate of Michael Jackson, allowing Sony to make a takeover bid for the Sony/ATV stake held by the estate of Michael Jackson, or vice versa. ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' felt that Sony acquiring the estate's stake was the most likely outcome, noting the potential revenue the library could bring in regards to licensing for on-demand music streaming services.&lt;ref name="bb-sonytrying"&gt;{{cite web|title=Is Sony Really Trying to Sell Its Publishing Giant? Behind the Scenes of the Sony/ATV Deal|url=http://www.billboard.com/articles/business/6722613/sony-atv-sale-analysis-contract-michael-jackson-estate|website=Billboard|accessdate=16 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On March 14, 2016, Sony announced that it will acquire the Jackson estate's stake in Sony/ATV in a deal valued at around $750 million, pending regulatory approval. The Jackson estate will retain a 10% stake in EMI Music Publishing, and its ownership of Mijac Music, which holds the rights to Michael Jackson's songs and master recordings. Sony Entertainment CEO [[Michael Lynton]] stated that the purchase would "enable Sony to more quickly adapt to changes in the music publishing business, while at the same time continuing to be an unparalleled leader in the industry and a treasured home for artists and writers." The revenue will primarily be used to pay off the estate's $250 million in debt, with the remainder to be placed in trust for Jackson's children. The deal was completed September 30, 2016.&lt;ref name="Sony Finalizes Acquisition of Michael Jackson Estate's Stake in Sony/ATV Publishing"/&gt;
===Acquisition of 60% of EMI Publishing in 2018 ===
In March 2018, media reported that Mubadala Investment Co., an Abu Dhabi sovereign wealth fund who was one of the buyers of EMI Publishing in 2012, has held talks with Sony and approached other possible buyers to sale its entire stake. Mubadala is reportedly seeking a valuation of at least $4 billion, almost twice what the Sony-led group paid six years ago.

On May 22, 2018, Sony announced it signed a legally binding [[memorandum of understanding]] ("MOU") for the sale of the Mubadala consortium's approximately 60% equity interest in EMI Music Publishing to Sony Corporation of America, a wholly owned subsidiary of Sony, for $2,3 billion, based on an enterprise value of $4.75 billion. Assuming the transaction goes through (it is subject to certain closing conditions, including regulatory approvals), Sony will indirectly own approximately 90% of EMI Music Publishing.

In July 2018, Sony/ATV bought out the Jackson estate's stake in EMI for $287.5 million. Sony has agreed to pay $2.3 billion to acquire EMI, as well as assume EMI’s debt of $1.359 billion. With Sony and Jackson’s share valued at $1.091 billion that gives EMI Music Publishing a valuation of $4.75 billion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.billboard.com/biz/articles/8467903/sony-completes-acquisition-of-michael-jackson-estates-share-of-emi-music|title=Sony Completes Acquisition of Michael Jackson Estate's Share of EMI Music Publishing|publisher=Billboard}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sony has declined to offer any concessions to the [[European Commission]].&lt;ref&gt;https://www.musicbusinessworldwide.com/sony-declines-to-submit-concessions-in-ec-over-proposed-2-3bn-emi-music-publishing-buyout&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Other developments ===

==== Death of Michael Jackson ====
Upon his death, Jackson's entertainment attorney, Joel Katz, commented on the singer's work as a businessman. "Michael Jackson was a perfectionist and his business affairs are worldwide. Many of them are quite ongoing and will be dealt with appropriately."&lt;ref name="Sony-Jackson Partnership Said to Plan on Keeping Beatles' Rights"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=20601087&amp;sid=aepaK43omDjk|title=Sony-Jackson Partnership Said to Plan on Keeping Beatles Rights|last=Fixmer|first=Andy|date=June 27, 2009|accessdate=June 28, 2009|publisher=[[Bloomberg L.P.]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ivan Thornton, a private-wealth adviser who worked with Jackson and [[Jackson family|his family]], also commended the business side of the musician. "His business mind was fascinating. We'd go to meetings with bankers and Wall Street people and once I explained the language to him, he totally got it. There was no formal education there, but his natural knack was off the charts."&lt;ref name="Sony-Jackson Partnership Said to Plan on Keeping Beatles' Rights" /&gt;

==== Ownership of the Beatles songs ====
In May 2001, Jackson denied rumours that he was planning to sell the Beatles' song catalogue. Rumours had circulated that the singer was to sell them in order to finance the upkeep of [[Neverland Ranch]] and to cover legal bill expenses.&lt;ref name="Jackson 'will not sell' Beatles song"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/music/1323693.stm|title=Jackson 'will not sell' Beatles' songs|date=May 10, 2001|accessdate=April 8, 2009|publisher=BBC}}&lt;/ref&gt; The singer announced in a statement, "I want to clarify a silly rumour – The Beatles catalogue is not for sale, has not been for sale and will never be for sale."&lt;ref name="Jackson 'will not sell' Beatles song" /&gt;

Following [[Death of Michael Jackson|Jackson's death]] in June 2009, there were reports that Jackson had left the Beatles catalogue to McCartney in his [[Will and testament|will]], having added it just five months before. (Jackson was reportedly expecting to die before McCartney despite being 16 years his junior due to various health problems.)&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.businessinsider.com/michael-jackson-left-the-beatles-catalog-to-paul-mccartney-2009-6 Michael Jackson Left The Beatles Catalog To Paul McCartney] ''Business Insider'' (June 26, 2009)&lt;/ref&gt; However, it was later revealed that Sony/ATV Music Publishing would keep control of the Beatles' songs.&lt;ref name="Sony-Jackson Partnership Said to Plan on Keeping Beatles' Rights" /&gt;

On 18 January 2017, McCartney filed a suit in [[United States district court]] against Sony/ATV Music Publishing seeking to reclaim ownership of his share of the [[Lennon–McCartney]] song catalogue beginning in 2018. Under US copyright law, for works published before 1978 the author can reclaim copyrights assigned to a publisher after 56 years.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/music/2017/jan/18/paul-mccartney-sue-sony-rights-beatles-songs|title=We can't work it out: Paul McCartney to sue Sony for rights to Beatles classics|date=18 January 2017|newspaper=The Guardian|access-date=19 January 2017|language=en-GB|issn=0261-3077}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/entertainment-arts-38675147|title=Sir Paul McCartney sues Sony over Beatles songs|date=19 January 2017|access-date=19 January 2017|publisher=BBC News|language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt; McCartney and Sony agreed to a confidential settlement in June 2017.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.theguardian.com/music/2017/jul/04/beatles-song-rights-dispute-paul-mccartney-and-sony-atv-work-it-out|title=Beatles song rights dispute: Paul McCartney and Sony ATV work it out|first=Agence|last=France-Presse|date=July 3, 2017|website=the Guardian}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://fortune.com/2017/06/30/sony-beatles-copyright/|title=Paul McCartney Settles with Sony/ATV to Reclaim Beatles Copyright|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Valuation==

=== Relevant value ===
A recent and relevant valuation is tied to Sony's acquisition of Jackson estate's stake in the company, completed on September 30, 2016&lt;ref name="Sony News Release 2016-10-03" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Sony Finalizes Acquisition of Michael Jackson Estate's Stake in Sony/ATV Publishing" /&gt; for $750 million. This values Sony/ATV at between $2.2 to $2.4 billion (including debt). &lt;!--This valuation is relevant because it is based on an actual sale.--&gt;

=== Previous estimates ===
Before the 2016 transaction with Sony, the reported value of Sony/ATV Music Publishing has varied across time and sources. Such valuations are uncertain, as illustrated by their wide variations, given a lack of actual transactions.
* In 2002, ''[[Forbes (magazine)|Forbes]]'' magazine estimated Jackson's 50% stake in the company, along with other music publishing ventures, to be worth $450&amp;nbsp;million.&lt;ref name="Who's The Unfairest Of Them All?"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.forbes.com/forbes/2002/0812/054_print.html|title=Who's The Unfairest of Them All?|last=Pulley|first=Brett|date=December 8, 2002|publisher=Forbes|accessdate=April 8, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* Industry experts valued the catalogue at between $600&amp;nbsp;million and $1&amp;nbsp;billion in 2004, based on the sales of rival catalogues.&lt;ref name="Jackson's finances are solid, adviser says"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.usatoday.com/life/people/2004-04-27-jackson-finances_x.htm|title=Jackson's finances are solid, adviser says|last=Gary|first=Strauss|date=April 27, 2004|publisher=''USA Today''|accessdate=April 8, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Charles Koppelman, a veteran music industry executive, stated that $1&amp;nbsp;billion was more reflective of Sony/ATV Music Publishing's worth.&lt;ref name="Jackson's finances are solid, adviser says" /&gt; "Buyers would be lining up around the block if it were ever put up for sale," he said. "And I'd be in the front of the line."&lt;ref name="Jackson's finances are solid, adviser says" /&gt;
* In 2005, Jackson's defense attorney, [[Thomas Mesereau]], claimed that the song catalogue had been valued at between $4&amp;nbsp;billion and $5&amp;nbsp;billion.&lt;ref name="Witness: Jacko Lived Way Above Means"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,155356,00.html|title=Witness: Jacko Lived Way Above Means|date=May 3, 2005|publisher=[[Fox News]]|accessdate=June 6, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* As of 2007, Jackson's own financial documents stated that his 50% share of the catalogue was worth $390.6&amp;nbsp;million,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2009/06/30/entertainment/main5125862.shtml | title=Family: Michael Jackson Had A Will|work=CBS News|date=June 30, 2009|accessdate=October 6, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; which would have made the entire catalogue worth $781.2&amp;nbsp;million.
* In 2009, the value of the company was further estimated by Ryan Schinman, chief of Platinum Rye, to be $1.5&amp;nbsp;billion.&lt;ref name="value"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://forbes.com/2009/06/26/michael-jackson-beatles-business-media-estate.html|title=Michael Jackson's Estate Sale|author=[[Zack O'Malley Greenburg]]|date=June 26, 2009|work=Forbes|accessdate=June 27, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{original research|date=August 2018}}
{{refimprove|date=August 2018}}
A '''statutory corporation''' is a [[corporation]] created by the state. Their precise nature varies by jurisdiction, thus, they might be ordinary companies/corporations owned by a government with or without other shareholders, or they might be a body without shareholders that is controlled by national or sub-national government to the (in some cases minimal) extent provided for in the creating legislation.

Bodies described in the English language as "statutory corporations" exist in the following countries in accordance with the associated descriptions (where provided).

==Australia==
In [[Australia]], statutory corporations are created by Acts of state or federal parliaments. Current statutory corporations include [[Australia Post]], [[Airservices Australia]], the [[Australian Rail Track Corporation]] and the [[Australian Egg Corporation]]. The purpose of their separation from normal government operations is to ensure profitability, and in theory, independence of decision making from the state or national government (to ensure that decisions are made on a commercial basis with less or no political interference.)

As statutory corporations, their regulatory and business conditions may be significantly different from private-sector companies. An example of this in Australia is the regulatory conditions placed on the national communications company [[Telstra]].

A significant number of the statutory corporations are private commercial operations, a number of which have been privatised, in part or in whole, since the 1980s: these have included the national airline [[Qantas]], [[Telstra]] (also previously known as Telecom Australia), and the [[Commonwealth Bank of Australia]].

==Germany==
A statutory corporation in Germany is called a ''Körperschaft des öffentlichen Rechts'' (KdöR). An example of a statutory corporation is a ''[[:de:Kassenärztliche Vereinigung|Kassenärztliche Vereinigung]]'', a body involved in the provision of out-patient medical services in a German state. The established Christian churches, the Jewish communities and the public broadcasters in Germany are other prominent examples.

==Hong Kong==
In Hong Kong, some corporations are incorporated by legislation. An example is the [[Kowloon-Canton Railway Corporation]], which owns the railway network and was previously also an operator. The [[MTR]] Corporation Limited was also such a company, then named as Mass Transit Railway Corporation. Other examples include the former [[Land Development Corporation]], and the Industrial Estates Corporation.

==India==
Statutory corporations are public enterprises brought into existence by a Special Act of the Parliament.  The Act defines its powers and functions, rules and regulations governing its employees and its relationship with government departments.

This is a corporate body created by the legislature with defined powers and functions and is financially independent with a clear control over a specified area or a particular type of commercial activity.  It is a [[corporate personhood|corporate person]] and has the capacity of acting in its own name. Statutory corporations therefore have the power of the government and the considerable amount of operating flexibility of private enterprises.
A few are:
* [[Airports Authority of India]]
* [[Damodar Valley Corporation]]
* [[National Highways Authority of India]]
* [[Central Warehousing Corporation]] (cewacor.nic.in/)
* [[Inland Waterways Authority of India]] (www.iwai.gov.in/)
* [[Food Corporation of India]] (fciweb.nic.in/)
* [[National Human Rights Commission of India|National Human Rights Commission]] (www.nhrc.nic.in/)

Features:
# Generally financed by the central or state government.
# May borrow funds from the public and government organisation through statutory sources.
# They have separate legal entity.
# They have to frame their own policies and procedures within the scope of state legislature.
# Provide better services to public and make adequate profit.
# They are autonomous in their functioning, thus, they enjoy operational flexibility.
# They can recruit and appoint their employees with their service condition, since they are a corporate body.
# They have to follow the special statute strictly.
# There is less government interference in matters of the corporation.
# The members of the corporation have limited liability.

==Republic of Ireland==
{{main|State-sponsored bodies of the Republic of Ireland}} 
In the [[Republic of Ireland]], a statutory corporation is a body corporate, which is created under a particular [[Act of the Oireachtas]]. Some statutory corporations are expected to operate as if they were a commercial company (with or without a [[subsidy]] from the [[Department of Finance|Exchequer]], depending on whether or not it would make a profit without one). Such bodies do not have [[shareholders]], but are typically boards appointed by a sponsor minister. The provisions of the Companies' Acts do not typically directly apply to such bodies, although their founding legislation may specify similar requirements.

The statutory corporation format was usually the form most [[state-sponsored bodies of the Republic of Ireland]] took until recent years; however, usual policy today is that a [[private limited company by shares]] or [[public limited company]] incorporated under the Companies' Acts is set up instead, with the relevant Minister holding 100% of the issued share capital. Nonetheless, {{As of|2007|lc=on}} several prominent statutory corporations continue to exist, such as [[Radio Telefís Éireann]] (RTÉ), the [[Electricity Supply Board]] (ESB), [[Bord Gáis Éireann]], [[An Bord Pleanála]], the [[Food Safety Authority of Ireland]].

In [[Northern Ireland]], statutory corporations operate as they do in other parts of the [[United Kingdom]].

==Netherlands==
{{Main|Public body (Netherlands)}}
In the [[Kingdom of the Netherlands|Netherlands]], the term "public body" is the general denomination for [[administrative division]]s within the Dutch state or certain other types of governmental organisations.

==United Kingdom==
In the [[United Kingdom]], a statutory corporation is a [[Body corporate|corporate body]] created by [[statute]].  It typically has no shareholders and its powers are defined by the Act of Parliament which creates it, and may be modified by later legislation. Such bodies were often created to provide public services, examples including [[British Railways]], the [[National Coal Board]], [[General Post Office (United Kingdom)#GPO dissolved|Post Office Corporation]] and [[Transport for London]].  Other examples include the [[county council]]s, the [[National Assembly for Wales]],&lt;ref&gt;[[Government of Wales Act 1998|Government of Wales Act]] 1998, Section 1&lt;/ref&gt; the [[BBC|British Broadcasting Corporation]] (BBC), [[Channel Four Television Corporation]], and the [[Olympic Delivery Authority]].&lt;ref&gt;[[London Olympic Games and Paralympic Games Act 2006]]&lt;/ref&gt; The phrase is not used to describe a company which operates as a conventional shareholder-owned company registered under the Companies Acts.

* A [[non-departmental public body]] is a classification to certain types of public bodies.
** [[Quango]] (quasi-autonomous-non-governmental organisation) is a commonly used acronym to refer to a non-departmental public body.
* The [[Scottish public bodies]] is used to indicate all quangos and other organisations in Scotland.

N.B. An entity described by the undefined term ''public body'' is not inevitably a ''statutory corporation''.

==United States==
At the state level, [[municipal corporation]]s and [[County (United States)|counties]] are often created by legislative acts. Some organizations such as a [[transit district]] or special purpose corporations such as a [[university]], are also created by statute.  In some states, a city or county can be created by petition of a certain number or percentage of voters or landholders of the affected area, which then causes a municipal corporation to be chartered as a result of compliance with the appropriate law.  Corporations to be established for most other purposes are usually just incorporated as any other  [[non-profit corporation]], by filing the paperwork with the appropriate agency as part of the formation of the entity.

At the Federal level, a small number of corporations are created by [[United States Congress|Congress]]. Prior to the [[District of Columbia]] being granted the ability to issue corporate charters in the late 19th century, corporations operating in the District required a [[congressional charter]]. With limited exceptions, most corporations created by Congress are not federally chartered, but are simply created as District of Columbia corporations as a result of the enabling law.{{Citation needed|date=June 2007}}

There are a number of federally chartered corporations that still exist. Some relatively famous ones include the [[Boy Scouts of America]], each of the [[Federal Reserve Bank]]s, and the [[Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation]].  The basic advantage for being federally chartered is that no other corporation anywhere in the United States is allowed to have the same name.

{{Politics of Guatemala}}
The '''Supreme Electoral Tribunal''' (officially: Supreme Electoral Tribunal of the [[Republic of Guatemala]]) is the highest authority in electoral matters. It is an independent constitutional body of political control, therefore, it is not subordinated to any organism of the State. This is governed by the Electoral and Political Parties Law, Decree 1-85 of the [[Congress of Guatemala|National Constituent Assembly]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.tse.org.gt/index.php/laip TSE]&lt;/ref&gt;

This institution has the power to hold the elections for the office of [[President of Guatemala|President of the Republic]] and [[Vice President of Guatemala|Vice President of the Republic]], for the positions of Deputies to the [[Congress of the Republic of Guatemala|Congress of the Republic]] and the [[Central American Parliament]] (as of the general elections of 2015), which it will be every four years, and popular consultation according to article 173 of the Constitution and the Electoral Constitutional Law. You must also organize them properly to make the votes cast by the citizenship transparent. However, if it does not, the Congress of the Republic is authorized to do so.

The Constitution and the Electoral Law assign to the Supreme Electoral Tribunal, Registry of Citizens and others of its organs, to exercise with exclusive functional independence the electoral jurisdiction, that is, the power to administer justice in electoral matters. That is, in addition to organizing elections and supervising the activity of political organizations, the law applies to specific cases and resolves disputes in the electoral field, acting as a second instance, when it meets the resolutions of the Citizens' Registry, which are subject to its revision, presenting an appeal for annulment.

'''Thou shalt not kill''' ([[LXX]]; {{lang|grc| οὐ φονεύσεις}}), '''You shall not murder''' ([[Biblical Hebrew|Hebrew]]: {{Hebrew| לֹא  [[:wikt:רצח|תִּרְצָח]] }} ''{{lang|he-Latn|lo tirṣaḥ}}'') or '''You shall not kill''' ([[KJV]]), is a [[moral imperative]] included as one of the [[Ten Commandments]] in the [[Torah]].&lt;ref&gt;Exodus 20:1-21, Deuteronomy 5:1-23, ''Ten Commandments,'' New Bible Dictionary, Second Edition, Tyndale House, 1982 pp. 1174-1175&lt;/ref&gt;

The imperative to not kill is in the context of ''unlawful'' killing resulting in [[:wikt:bloodguilt|bloodguilt]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/judaica/ejud_0002_0003_0_03145.html Bloodguilt, Jewish Virtual Library], Genesis 4:10, Genesis 9:6, Genesis 42:22, Exodus 22:2-2, Leviticus 17:4, Leviticus 20, Numbers 20, Deuteronomy 19, Deuteronomy 32:43, Joshua 2:19, Judges 9:24, 1 Samuel 25, 2 Samuel 1, 2 Samuel 21, 1 Kings 2, 1 Kings 21:19, 2 Kings 24:4, Psalm 9:12, Psalm 51:14, Psalm 106:38, Proverbs 6:17, Isaiah 1:15, Isaiah 26:21, Jeremiah 22:17, Lamentations 4:13, Ezekiel 9:9, Ezekiel 36:18, Hosea 4:2, Joel 3:19, Habakkuk 2:8, Matthew 23:30-35, Matthew 27:4, Luke 11:50-51, Romans 3:15, Revelation 6:10, Revelation 18:24&lt;/ref&gt;

==Hebrew Bible==

=== Retzach ===
The [[Biblical Hebrew|Hebrew]] verb {{Hebrew|[[:wikt:רצח|רצח]]}} (''r-ṣ-ḥ'', also transliterated ''retzach, ratzákh, ratsakh'' etc.) is the word in the original text that is translated as "murder" or "kill", but it has a wider range of meanings, generally describing destructive activity, including meanings "to break, to dash to pieces" as well as "to slay, kill, murder".

According to the [[Priestly Code]] of the [[Book of Numbers]], killing anyone outside the context of war with a weapon, or in unarmed combat, is considered ''retzach'', but if the killing is accidental, the accused must flee to one of the cities of refuge—and remain in that city until the high priest dies, or the “revenger of blood” can kill the accused with no legal repercussions. The Bible never uses the word ''retzach'' in conjunction with war.

The act of slaying itself, regardless of questions of bloodguilt, is expressed with the verb ''n-k-h'' "to strike, smite, hit, beat, slay, kill". This verb is used of both an Egyptian slaying an Israelite slave and of Moses slaying the Egyptian in retaliation in {{bibleverse||Exodus|2:11-12|}}. The [[Covenant Code]] and [[Holiness Code]] both prescribe the [[death penalty]] for people that commit ''n-k-h''.

The commandment against murder can be viewed as a legal issue governing human relationships, noting that the first four commandments relate strongly to man's duty to God and that the latter six commandments describe duties toward humans.&lt;ref&gt;Hester, Joseph P., ''The Ten Commandments: a handbook of religious, legal, and social issues'', MacFarland, 2003, pp. 19-20&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Commentary on Exodus 20, The Jewish Study Bible, Oxford University Press, 2004, p. 150&lt;/ref&gt;  The commandment against murder can also be viewed as based in respect for God himself.&lt;ref&gt;The Ten Commandments, William Barclay, Westminster John Knox Press, 1998, p. 52&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The Ten Commandments, G. Cambell Morgan, Flaming H. Revell, 1901, pp. 66-67&lt;/ref&gt;  Since man is made in God's image, the shedding of innocent blood is viewed as a direct offense against God.&lt;ref&gt;Genesis 9:6, see also James 3:9&lt;/ref&gt; "The voice of your brother's blood is crying to me from the ground. And now you are cursed from the ground, which has opened its mouth to receive your brother's blood from your hand." {{Bibleref2|Genesis|4:10-11|ESV}} (ESV)

The Genesis narrative also portrays the prohibition of shedding innocent blood as an important aspect of God's covenant with Noah.&lt;ref&gt;The Catholic Catechism 2260&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''The Ten commandments: a handbook of religious, legal, and social issues'', Joseph P. Hester, MacFarland, 2003, p. 21&lt;/ref&gt;
{{quote|Whoever sheds the blood of man, by man shall his blood be shed, for God made man in his own image. |{{Bibleref2|Genesis|9:6|ESV}} (ESV)}}

The [[Torah]] portrays murder as a capital crime and describes a number of details in the moral understanding and legal implementation of consequences.&lt;ref name="autogenerated52"&gt;Barclay, William. ''The Ten Commandments'', Westminster John Knox Press, 1998, pp. 52-57&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/judaica/ejud_0002_0003_0_03145.html Exodus 21:28-31 Jewish Virtual Library]&lt;/ref&gt; The Priestly Code allowed the victim's next of kin (''[[go'el|avenger of blood]]'') exact retribution on the suspect; but the accused could seek sanctuary in a ''[[Cities of Refuge|city of refuge]]''. The right of the ''avenger of blood'' to such revenge ceased, upon the death of the person who was the [[Kohen Gadol|Jewish High Priest]] at the time of the crime&lt;ref name=Saunders/&gt;

Another verb meaning "to kill, slay, murder, destroy, ruin" is ''h-r-g'', used of [[Cain and Abel|Cain slaying Abel]] in Genesis 4:8. When Cain is driven into exile, complaining that "every one that findeth me shall slay me" in {{bibleverse||Genesis|4:14|}}, he again uses this verb (''h-r-g''). Eliezer Segal observes that the [[Septuagint]] uses the term ''harag'', and that [[Augustine of Hippo]] recognized that this did not extend to wars or capital punishment. Most subsequent translations follow [[Jerome]]'s [[Vulgate]]. While Jerome had access to Jewish scholars, "even the Jewish translators were not unanimous in maintaining a consistent distinctions between the various Hebrew roots."&lt;ref&gt;[http://people.ucalgary.ca/~elsegal/Shokel/001102_ThouShaltNotMurder.html Segal, Eliezer. "Thou Shalt Not Murder", ''Jewish Free Press'', 19 October 2000, p. 8]&lt;/ref&gt; Jerome's choice of the word ''occidere'' (to kill) reflects the broader range of meanings.

In a more modern analysis, Wilma Ann Bailey also finds a broader application of the word ''retzach''.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=HGuW6v85qiMC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=thou+shalt+not+kill&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiMlrbXhZ_MAhWBWT4KHbcOCcgQ6AEILjAE#v=onepage&amp;q=thou%20shalt%20not%20kill&amp;f=false Bailey, Wilma Ann.

===Justified killing: due consequence for crime===
The [[Torah]] and [[Hebrew Bible]] made clear distinctions between the shedding of innocent blood versus killing as the due consequence of a crime.  A number of sins were considered to be worthy of the death penalty including murder,&lt;ref&gt;Exodus 21:12, Leviticus 24:17&lt;/ref&gt; incest,&lt;ref&gt;Leviticus 20:12&lt;/ref&gt; bearing false witness on a capital charge,&lt;ref&gt;Deuteronomy 19:8-21&lt;/ref&gt; adultery,&lt;ref&gt;Leviticus 20:10&lt;/ref&gt; idolatry,&lt;ref&gt;Exodus 22:20&lt;/ref&gt; [[bestiality]],&lt;ref&gt;Leviticus 20:15&lt;/ref&gt; human sacrifice to pagan gods,&lt;ref&gt;Leviticus 20:2&lt;/ref&gt; cursing a parent,&lt;ref&gt;Leviticus 20:9&lt;/ref&gt; [[fortune-telling]],&lt;ref&gt;Leviticus 20:27&lt;/ref&gt; and other sins.

For example, the Exodus narrative describes the people as having turned to idolatry with the [[golden calf]] while Moses was on the mountain receiving the law from God. When Moses came down, he commanded the Levites to take up the sword against their brothers and companions and neighbors. The Levites obeyed and killed about three thousand men who had sinned in worship of the golden calf.  As a result, Moses said that the Levites had received a blessing that day at the cost of son and brother.&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleref2|Exodus|32:29}}&lt;/ref&gt; On a separate occasion, a blasphemer was stoned to death because he blasphemed the name of the Lord ([[Yahweh]]) with a curse.&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleref2|Leviticus|24:10-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Hebrew Bible has many other examples of sinners being put to death as due consequence for crimes. Achan is put to death by Joshua because he caused defeat of Israel’s army by taking some of the plunder and hiding it in his tent.&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleref2|Joshua|7:10-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;’’The Ten Commandments,’’ G. Cambell Morgan, Flaming H. Revell, 1901, p. 69&lt;/ref&gt; David ordered that an Amalekite be put to death because he claimed to have killed King Saul.&lt;ref name=Saunders/&gt; Following the advice of his father, Solomon ordered that Joab be killed:
{{quote|Strike him down and bury him, and so clear me and my father's house of the guilt of the innocent blood that Joab shed. The Lord will repay him for the blood he shed, because without the knowledge of my father David he attacked two men and killed them with the sword. Both of them—Abner son of Ner, commander of Israel's army, and Amasa son of Jether, commander of Judah's army—were better men and more upright than he.  May the guilt of their blood rest on the head of Joab and his descendants forever. But on David and his descendants, his house and his throne, may there be the Lord's peace forever.|1 Kings 2:31-33 (NIV)}}

The biblical refrain for those justly executed as due punishment for crimes is that "their blood will be on their own heads."&lt;ref&gt;Leviticus 20, 2 Samuel 1:16, Ezekiel 18:13,&lt;/ref&gt; This expresses the idea that those guilty of certain actions have brought the shedding of blood upon themselves, and those carrying out due punishment do not bear [[wikt:bloodguilt|bloodguilt]].

===Justified killing: in warfare===
{{Further information|Herem (war or property)}}
The ancient Hebrew texts make a distinction between the moral and legal prohibition of shedding of innocent blood and killing in battle.&lt;ref&gt;The Catholic Catechism 2261&lt;/ref&gt; Rabbi Marc Gellman explains the distinction between "harag" (killing) and "ratzah" (murder) and notes the different moral connotations. "...there is wide moral agreement (not complete agreement) that some forms of killing are morally just, and killing an enemy combatant during wartime is one of them."&lt;ref&gt;[http://articles.chicagotribune.com/2012-04-12/features/sns-201204101200--tms--godsqudctngs-a20120412apr12_1_commandment-killing-murder Gellman, Marc. "The commandment that 'Thou shalt not kill' refers to murder", God Squad, ''Chicago Tribune'', 12 April 2012]&lt;/ref&gt; For example, the [[Torah]] prohibits murder, but sanctions killing in legitimate battle.&lt;ref&gt;Matthew Henry’s Commentary on Exodus 20:13, Exodus 34:10-14, Deuteronomy 7:7-26&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;
Later generations have given great consideration to the question of what constitutes "legitimate battle."&lt;/ref&gt;  The Bible often praises the exploits of soldiers against enemies in legitimate battle.  One of David’s mighty men is credited with killing eight hundred men with the spear,&lt;ref&gt;2 Samuel 23:8&lt;/ref&gt; and Abishai is credited with killing three hundred men.&lt;ref&gt;2 Samuel 23:18&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[613 Mitzvot]] extend the notion of lawful killing to the nations that inhabited the [[Promised Land]], commanding to exterminate them completely.
[[Deuteronomy]] 20:10-18 establishes rules on killing civilians in warfare:
*the population of cities outside of the Promised Land, if they surrender, should be made tributaries and left alive (20:10-11)
*those cities outside of the Promised Land that resist should be besieged, and once they fall, the male population should be exterminated, but the women and children should be left alive (20:12-15)
*of those cities that were within the Promised Land, however, everybody was to be killed.&lt;ref name=Saunders&gt;[http://www.cmf.org.uk/publications/content/?context=article&amp;id=1364 Saunders, Peter. "Thou Shalt Not Kill - The Christian case against compassionate killing", Christian Medical Fellowship]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Justified killing: intruder in the home===
As described in the Torah, the ancient understanding of the prohibition of murder made an exception for legitimate self-defense.  A home defender who struck and killed a thief caught in the act of breaking in at night was not guilty of bloodshed.  "If a thief is caught breaking in and is struck so that he dies, the defender is not guilty of bloodshed; but if it happens after sunrise, he is guilty of bloodshed."&lt;ref&gt;Exodus 22:2-3&lt;/ref&gt;
{{quote|source=Henry, M. "1706. Commentary on the whole Bible, volume I (Genesis to Deuteronomy). Christian Classics Ethereal Library."|A man's house is his castle, and God's law, as well as man's, sets a guard upon it; he that assaults it does so at his peril.|Matthew Henry}}

==Jewish doctrine==
{{Further information|Judaism and violence|Peace and war in Judaism}}
Jewish law views the shedding of innocent blood very seriously, and lists murder as one of three sins (along with idolatry and sexual immorality) that fall under the category of [[yehareg ve'al ya'avor]], meaning "One should let himself be killed rather than violate it."&lt;ref&gt;Babylonian Talmud, Sanhedrin 74a, http://www.halakhah.com/sanhedrin/sanhedrin_74.html&lt;/ref&gt;  Jewish law enumerates [[613 Mitzvot]], or commandments, including prohibition of murder and a number of other commandments related to the preserving of human life and administration of justice in cases of shedding of innocent blood.

|[[Sefer Hamitzvot]] by [[Maimonides]]}}

Life is considered very precious, even sacred by Jewish teaching.  The [[Talmud]] cites the prohibition of shedding innocent blood in Genesis 9:6 as the reason why the death penalty should be carried out against non-Jews as well as Jews, and while faithful Jews are required to obey [[613 Mitzvot]], gentiles are only obliged to obey the seven [[Noahide laws]], which include the prohibition of murder and establishment of a justice system to administer law honestly.&lt;ref&gt;Tractate Sanhedrin 57a, http://www.halakhah.com/sanhedrin/sanhedrin_57.html&lt;/ref&gt;  Rabbi Dr. Azriel Rosenfeld offers a representative modern summary of Jewish teaching regarding the command not to murder.

{{quote| Chapter 68. Murderer and Protection of Life - Rotze'ach u-Shemiras Nefesh&lt;br&gt;
It is forbidden to murder, as it says "You shall not murder" (Exodus 20:13, Deuteronomy 5:17).&lt;br&gt; A murderer must be put to death, as it says "He shall be avenged" (Exodus 21:20, see Leviticus 24:17,21); it is forbidden to accept compensation from him instead, as it says "You shall not take redemption for the life of a murderer...; and there shall be no atonement for the blood that was spilled... except the blood of him that spilled it" (Numbers 35:31-33). It is forbidden to execute a murderer before he has stood trial, as it says "And the murderer shall not die until he stands before the congregation for judgment" (Numbers 35:12). However, we are commanded to prevent an attempted murder by killing the would-be murderer if necessary, and it is forbidden to refrain from doing so, as it says "And you shall cut off her hand; you shall not be merciful" (Deuteronomy 25:12); and similarly for attempted fornication, as it says "[If the man seizes her and lies with her...] just as a man rises up against his friend and murders him, so is this thing"(Deuteronomy 22:26). It is forbidden to refrain from saving life when it is in one's power to do so, as it says "You shall not stand on your friend's blood"(Leviticus 19:16).|Rabbi Dr. Azriel Rosenfeld&lt;ref&gt;http://www.torah.org/learning/halacha-overview/chapter68.html&lt;/ref&gt;}}

In the Talmud, Genesis 9:5 is interpreted as a prohibition against killing oneself, and Genesis 9:6 is "cited in support for the prohibition of abortion."&lt;ref&gt;Commentary on Genesis 9, The Jewish Study Bible, Oxford University Press, 2004, p. 25, Talmud b.B.K 91b, b Sanhedrin 57b&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the ''[[Mishnah]]'' (older part of the ''Talmud''), it is said of [[Hillel the Elder]] that he saw a skull that was floating on top of the water and he said (to it): "Since you drowned [others, others] drowned you. And in the end, those that drowned you will be drowned."&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.sefaria.org/Pirkei_Avot.2.6?lang=bi&amp;with=all&amp;lang2=en Pirkei Avot 2:6, Babylonian Talmud] In: www.sefaria.org, retrieved 2 September 2018&lt;/ref&gt; From [[Rabbi Tarfon]] and [[Rabbi Akiva]] it is stated in the ''Mishnah'': "If we were on the ''Sanhedrin'', nobody would have ever been executed."&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.sefaria.org/Mishnah_Makkot.1.10?lang=bi&amp;with=all&amp;lang2=en Makkot 1:10] In: www.sefaria.org, retrieved 2 September 2018&lt;/ref&gt;

==New Testament doctrine==
{{POV section|reason=It seems to be written to support capital punishment|date=April 2017}}
{{See also|Biblical law in Christianity}}

The New Testament is in agreement that murder is a grave moral evil,&lt;ref&gt;Matthew 5:21, Matthew 15:19, Matthew 19:19, Matthew 22:7, Mark 10:19, Luke 18:20, Romans 13:9, 1 Timothy 1:9, James 2:11, Revelation 21:8&lt;/ref&gt; and maintains the Old Testament view of bloodguilt.&lt;ref&gt;Matthew 23:30-35, Matthew 27:4, Luke 11:50-51, Romans 3:15, Revelation 6:10, Revelation 18:24&lt;/ref&gt;   Jesus himself repeats and expands upon the commandment, "Do not murder."&lt;ref&gt;Matthew 5:21, Matthew 19:19, Mark 10:19, Luke 18:20&lt;/ref&gt;  The New Testament depicts Jesus as explaining that murder, as well as other sins, comes from the heart.
{{quote| For out of the heart come evil thoughts, murder, adultery, sexual immorality, theft, false testimony, slander.|Matthew 15:19 (NIV)}}

The New Testament acknowledges the just and proper role of civil government in maintaining justice&lt;ref&gt;Romans 13:1-7, 1 Peter 4:15, John Calvin, Institutes of the Christian Religion, Book 4, Chapter 20, http://www.reformed.org/books/institutes/books/book4/bk4ch20.html&lt;/ref&gt; and punishing evildoers, even to the point of "bearing the sword."&lt;ref&gt;Romans 13:4 and commentary, The NIV Study Bible, Zondervan, 1995 p. 2240&lt;/ref&gt;  One criminal on the cross contrasts his death as due punishment with Jesus’ death as an innocent man.&lt;ref&gt;Luke 23:41&lt;/ref&gt; When Jesus appeared before Pilate, both Pilate&lt;ref&gt;Matthew 27:24&lt;/ref&gt; and the crowd&lt;ref&gt;Matthew 27:25&lt;/ref&gt; recognize the principles of bloodguilt.  There is no indication in the New Testament that it is unjust, immoral, or inappropriate for secular civil governments to execute those guilty of shedding innocent blood.&lt;ref&gt;Matthew 22:7, Romans 13, John Calvin, Institutes of the Christian Religion, Book 4, Chapter 20, [http://www.reformed.org/books/institutes/books/book4/bk4ch20.html Catechism of the Catholic Church 2267]&lt;/ref&gt;

Like the Old Testament, the New Testament seems to depict the lawful use of force by soldiers in legitimate battles as justified.&lt;ref&gt;Catechism of the Catholic Church 2309-2310&lt;/ref&gt;  The profession of soldier is used as a metaphor by [[Paul the Apostle|Paul]] exhorting the [[Epistle to the Ephesians|Ephesians]] to "put on the full [[armor of God]]."&lt;ref&gt;Ephesians 6&lt;/ref&gt;  Cornelius, the Roman centurion, is portrayed as a righteous and God-fearing man.&lt;ref&gt;Acts 10, An Exposition of the Bible, Volume 5, Marcus Dods, et al., S.S. Scranton Co., 1903, pp. 428-435&lt;/ref&gt;  Jesus praises the faith of a Roman centurion on the occasion of healing the centurion’s servant, and states that he has not found such great faith even in Israel.&lt;ref&gt;Luke 7:1-10, An Exposition of the Bible, Volume 5, Marcus Dods, et al., S.S. Scranton Co., 1903, p. 429&lt;/ref&gt;  When John the Baptist was preaching repentance and baptizing penitent sinners in the Jordan river, soldiers came to John and asked for specific instructions regarding their repentance.  John the Baptist did not demand that the soldiers renounce their profession, instead he exhorted them to be content with their pay.&lt;ref&gt;An Exposition of the Bible, Volume 5, Marcus Dods, et al., S.S. Scranton Co., 1903, p. 429&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|Don't extort money and don't accuse people falsely—be content with your pay.|Luke 3:14 (NIV)}}

Jesus was not condoning violence as the very next verse confirms it was to satisfy the prophecy of Isaiah 53 when he told his disciples to buy a sword if they do not have one, "now if you have a purse, take it, and also a bag; and if you don't have a sword, sell your cloak and buy one."&lt;ref&gt;Luke 22:36-37 NIV&lt;/ref&gt;  Jesus was quick to correct his servant for the improper use of the sword in cutting off the ear of the high-priest’s servant.

{{quote|Then said Jesus unto him, Put up again thy sword into his place: for all they that take the sword shall perish with the sword. Thinkest thou that I cannot now pray to my Father, and he shall presently give me more than twelve legions of angels? |Matthew 26:52-53 (KJV)}}

In John 8:7 Jesus replied to the question of capital punishment because of adultery to [[wikt:let him who is without sin cast the first stone|''let him who is without sin cast the first stone'']] - and no one did.

==Roman Catholic doctrine==

This commandment demands respect for human life and is more accurately translated as "thou shalt not murder." Killing may, under limited circumstances, be justified within Catholicism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The Essential Catholic Catechism |last=Schreck |first=Alan |year=1999 |publisher=Servant Publications |isbn=1-56955-128-6 |pages=310–312}}&lt;/ref&gt; The basis of all Catholic teaching about the fifth commandment is the "[[sanctity of life]]", which is often contrasted with the "[[Quality of Life (Healthcare)|quality of life]]" to some extent.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=rzIMeFZZuycC |title=Jewish and Catholic Bioethics: An Ecumenical Dialogue |editor1=[[Edmund Pellegrino|Edmund D.

=== Abortion ===
According to the ''[[Catechism of the Catholic Church]]'':
{{quote|Human life is sacred’’ because from its beginning it involves the creative action of God and it remains for ever in a special relationship with the Creator, who is its sole end. God alone is the Lord of life from its beginning until its end: no one can under any circumstance claim for himself the right directly to destroy an innocent human being… The deliberate murder of an innocent person is gravely contrary to the dignity of the human being, to the golden rule, and to the holiness of the Creator. The law forbidding it is universally valid: it obliges each and everyone, always and everywhere... The fifth commandment forbids [[direct and intentional]] killing as [[mortal sin|gravely sinful]]. The murderer and those who cooperate voluntarily in murder commit a sin that cries out to heaven for vengeance.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.vatican.va/archive/catechism/p3s2c2a5.htm Catechism of the Catholic Church §§2258,2261,2268]&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The ''Catechism'' states that [[Abortion and the Catholic Church|abortion]] is a grave moral evil because the act takes an innocent human life: human life must be respected and protected absolutely from the moment of conception. From the first moment of his existence, "a human being must be recognized as having the rights of a person - among which is the inviolable right of every innocent being to life."&lt;ref name="vatican2"&gt;Catechism of the Catholic Church 2270 http://www.vatican.va/archive/catechism/p3s2c2a5.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Capital punishment ===
Legitimate defense is depicted as justifiable, even if the defender deals his aggressor a lethal blow.  However, a person should not use more force than necessary to repel an attack.  The legitimate defense of persons and societies should not be considered as an exception to the prohibition of murdering the innocent: the preservation of innocent life is seen as the intended outcome.  Injury or death to the aggressor is not the intended outcome, it is the unfortunate consequence of using necessary force to repel an imminent threat.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.vatican.va/archive/catechism/p3s2c2a5.htm Catechism of the Catholic Church §§2263-2264]&lt;/ref&gt;

Legitimate defense can be not only a right but a grave duty for one who is responsible for the lives of others.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.chicagoreader.com/chicago/chicago-police-chaplains-ministry-deadly-force-dan-brandt/Content?oid=19159359 DeGrane, Susan. "Thou shalt not Kill?", ''Chicago Reader'', 18 September 2015]&lt;/ref&gt; The Catechism says: "The defense of the common good requires that an unjust aggressor be rendered unable to cause harm. For this reason, those who legitimately hold authority also have the right to use arms to repel aggressors against the civil community entrusted to their responsibility."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.vatican.va/archive/catechism/p3s2c2a5.htm Catechism of the Catholic Church §2265]&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''Catechism'' teaches that legitimate public authority has the right and duty to punish criminals proportionally to the gravity of the offense to safeguard the public good.  Nonlethal means are preferred, if these are sufficient to defend and protect people’s safety. Recourse to the death penalty was not excluded in the past. In August 2018 the [[Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith]] with the approval of Pope Francis changed paragraph 2267 of the [[Catechism of the Catholic Church]] and declared that the death penalty is always regarded as inadmissible.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/europe/pope-francis-death-penalty-catholic-teaching-execution-humans-a8474256.html Pope Francis changes Catholic teaching to oppose death penalty, saying capital punishment 'attacks' human dignity] In: www.independent.co.uk, 2 August 2018&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.catholicnewsagency.com/news/vatican-changes-catechism-teaching-on-death-penalty-calls-it-inadmissible-28541 Vatican changes Catechism teaching on death penalty, calls it ‘inadmissible’] In: www.catholicnewsagency.com, 2 August 2018&lt;/ref&gt; An [[Ohio]] prosecutor publicly declared that he disagrees with that,&lt;ref&gt;[https://cruxnow.com/church-in-the-usa/2018/08/05/prosecutor-disagrees-with-pope-franciss-death-penalty-ruling/ Prosecutor disagrees with Pope Francis’s death penalty ruling] In: cruxnow.com, 5 August 2018&lt;/ref&gt; while Catholic US scholars drafted an appeal against the change and declared it "scandalous".&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.firstthings.com/web-exclusives/2018/08/an-appeal-to-the-cardinals-of-the-catholic-church An Appeal to the Cardinals of the Catholic Church] In: www.firstthings.com, 15 August 2018&lt;/ref&gt; 
:Recourse to the death penalty on the part of legitimate authority, following a fair trial, was long considered an appropriate response to the gravity of certain crimes and an acceptable, albeit extreme, means of safeguarding the common good.
:Today, however, there is an increasing awareness that the dignity of the person is not lost even after the commission of very serious crimes. In addition, a new understanding has emerged of the significance of penal sanctions imposed by the state. Lastly, more effective systems of detention have been developed, which ensure the due protection of citizens but, at the same time, do not definitively deprive the guilty of the possibility of redemption.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.vatican.va/roman_curia/congregations/cfaith/documents/rc_con_cfaith_doc_20180801_catechismo-penadimorte_en.html NEW REVISION OF NUMBER 2267] vatican.va, retrieved 2 September 2018&lt;/ref&gt;

In February 2016 [[Pope Francis]] called for the suspension of the death penalty for the duration of the [[Extraordinary Jubilee of Mercy|Holy Year]] "because modern means existed to 'efficiently repress crime without definitively denying the person who committed it the possibility of rehabilitating themselves."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Pullella|first1=Philip|title=Pope calls for worldwide abolition of death penalty|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-pope-capitalpunishment-idUSKCN0VU0GH|work=Reuters|date=21 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Suicide, euthanasia, health, intoxication ===
Catholic teaching strictly prohibits [[euthanasia]] and [[suicide]] as violations of the commandment, "You shall not kill."&lt;ref&gt;Catechism of the Catholic Church 2276-2283 http://www.vatican.va/archive/catechism/p3s2c2a5.htm&lt;/ref&gt;  Recognizing life and health as precious gifts from God, adherents are encouraged to avoid excess of food, tobacco, alcohol, and medications.  Endangering others with excesses speed or drunkenness on the roadway incurs grave guilt.&lt;ref&gt;Catechism of the Catholic Church 2288-2290 http://www.vatican.va/archive/catechism/p3s2c2a5.htm&lt;/ref&gt;  The use of drugs, except on strictly therapeutic grounds is a grave offense. Clandestine production and trafficking in drugs constitute "direct co-operation in evil." &lt;ref&gt;Catechism of the Catholic Church 2291 http://www.vatican.va/archive/catechism/p3s2c2a5.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

=== War and self-defense ===
The Catholic Catechism urges prayer for the avoidance of [[war]].  All citizens and governments are obliged to work toward the avoidance of war.  However, it recognizes that governments cannot be denied the lawful right to self-defense, once all peace efforts have failed.  The use of legitimate defense by a military force is considered grave and therefore subject to rigorous considerations of moral legitimacy.  Elements of [[just war theory]] are explicitly enumerated in the Catechism:&lt;ref&gt;Catechism of the Catholic Church 2307-2317 http://www.vatican.va/archive/ENG0015/__P81.HTM&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
*the damage inflicted by the aggressor on the nation or community of nations must be lasting, grave, and certain;
*all other means of putting an end to it must have been shown to be impractical or ineffective;
* there must be serious prospects of success;
*the use of arms must not produce evils and disorders graver than the evil to be eliminated. The power of modern means of destruction weighs very heavily in evaluating this condition.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Reformation and Post-Reformation doctrines==
[[Martin Luther]] summarized the commandment against shedding innocent blood as grounded in the fear and love of God, and as having both positive and negative aspects: negative in that we must neither harm nor hurt our neighbor’s body; positive in that we must help our neighbor and care for him when he is ill.
{{quote| You must not murder.(Exodus 20:13)
Q. What does this mean?&lt;br&gt;
A. We should fear and love God so that we may not hurt or harm our neighbor in his body, but help and befriend him in every bodily need [in every need and danger of life and body]. Martin Luther, The [[Small Catechism]]&lt;ref&gt;Martin Luther, The Small Catechism, The Fifth Commandment, http://www.ccel.org/ccel/luther/smallcat.text.i.5.html&lt;/ref&gt;}}

In a more detailed teaching, Martin Luther explains that God and government are not constrained by the commandment not to kill, but that God has delegated his authority in punishing evildoers to the government.  The prohibition of killing is forbidden to the individual in his relation to anyone else, and not to the government.

{{quote|We have now completed both the spiritual and the temporal government, that is, the divine and the paternal authority and obedience. But here now we go forth from our house among our neighbors to learn how we should live with one another, every one himself toward his neighbor. Therefore God and government are not included in this commandment nor is the power to kill, which they have taken away. For God has delegated His authority to punish evil-doers to the government instead of parents, who aforetime (as we read in Moses) were required to bring their own children to judgment and sentence them to death. Therefore, what is here forbidden is forbidden to the individual in his relation to any one else, and not to the government.| Martin Luther, [[Large Catechism]]&lt;ref&gt;The Large Catechism by Martin Luther, Translated by F. Bente and W.H.T. Dau Published in: Triglot Concordia: The Symbolical Books of the Ev. Lutheran Church (St. Louis: Concordia Publishing House, 1921) pp. 565-773 http://www.iclnet.org/pub/resources/text/wittenberg/luther/catechism/web/cat-07.html&lt;/ref&gt;}}

In [[The Institutes of the Christian Religion]], [[John Calvin]] viewed the purport of this commandment as the safety of all being entrusted to each person.  All violence and injustice, and every kind of harm from which our neighbor’s body suffers is thereby prohibited.  Christians are therefore required to faithfully perform that which is within their power to defend the life of their neighbor, be vigilant in warding off harm, and assist in removing danger when it comes.Calvin asserts that the same rule must also be applied in regulating the mind against anger, arguing that since God sees the heart and mind, the commandment against shedding innocent blood also prohibits murder of the heart and requires a sincere desire to preserve our brother’s life.  The hand does not commit the murder unless it is conceived by the mind under the influence of wrath and hatred.  According to Calvin, where wrath and hatred dwell, there is an inclination to do mischief, quoting the Bible, "whosoever hateth his brother is a murderer"([[1 John]] 3:15) and "whosoever is angry with his brother without a cause shall be in danger of the judgement" ([[Gospel of Matthew]] 5:22).&lt;ref&gt;John Calvin, Institutes of the Christian Religion, Chapter 8, Part III, Section 39 http://www.spurgeon.org/~phil/calvin/bk2ch08.html#thirtynin.htm {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141020000248/http://www.spurgeon.org/~phil/calvin/bk2ch08.html#thirtynin.htm |date=20 October 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

John Calvin also makes a case that the command against shedding blood is founded both in the creation of man in the image of God and in the need for a man to cherish his own flesh.

{{quote|Scripture notes a twofold equity on which this commandment is founded. Man is both the image of God and our flesh. Wherefore, if we would not violate the image of God, we must hold the person of man sacred—if we would not divest ourselves of humanity we must cherish our own flesh. The practical inference to be drawn from the redemption and gift of Christ will be elsewhere considered. The Lord has been pleased to direct our attention to these two natural considerations as inducements to watch over our neighbour's preservation, viz., to revere the divine image impressed upon him, and embrace our own flesh. To be clear of the crime of murder, it is not enough to refrain from shedding man's blood. If in act you perpetrate, if in endeavour you plot, if in wish and design you conceive what is adverse to another's safety, you have the guilt of murder. On the other hand, if you do not according to your means and opportunity study to defend his safety, by that inhumanity you violate the law. But if the safety of the body is so carefully provided for, we may hence infer how much care and exertion is due to the safety of the soul, which is of immeasurably higher value in the sight of God. |John Calvin&lt;ref&gt;John Calvin, Institutes of the Christian Religion, Chapter 8, Part III, Section 40 http://www.spurgeon.org/~phil/calvin/bk2ch08.html#thirtynin.htm {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141020000248/http://www.spurgeon.org/~phil/calvin/bk2ch08.html#thirtynin.htm |date=20 October 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Matthew Henry considered the commandment against killing to apply to both one’s own life as well as the life of one’s neighbor and considered it to apply not only to causing of death but also to prohibit any thing unjustly hurtful to or injurious to the health, ease, and life of one’s own body or the body of any other person.&lt;ref name="godstenlaws1"&gt;Matthew Henry’s Commentary on Exodus 20 :13 http://godstenlaws.com/ten-commandments/mh-commentary6.html&lt;/ref&gt; He also ties the commandment against bloodshed back to the command to [[Noah]], and he sees it as a command applying to the individual against his neighbor, but not against killing in lawful war, for one’s own necessary defense, or against the government instituting due punishments for criminal offenses.  He portrays lying in wait for the blood of the innocent as a grave offense against human dignity as one of the fundamental laws of nature.

{{quote|This is one of the laws of nature, and was strongly enforced by the precepts given to Noah and his sons, Gen. 9:5, 6. It does not forbid killing in lawful war, or in our own necessary defence, nor the magistrate’s putting offenders to death, for those things tend to the preserving of life; but it forbids all malice and hatred to the person of any (for he that hateth his brother is a murderer), and all personal revenge arising therefrom; also all rash anger upon sudden provocations, and hurt said or done, or aimed to be done, in passion: of this our Saviour expounds this commandment, Mt. 5:22. And, as that which is worst of all, it forbids persecution, laying wait for the blood of the innocent and excellent ones of the earth.|Matthew Henry&lt;ref name="godstenlaws1"/&gt;}}

A '''training contract''' is a compulsory period of practical training in a [[law firm]] for [[legal education|law graduates]] before they can qualify as a [[solicitor]] in the [[United Kingdom]] (UK), the [[Republic of Ireland]], [[Australia]] or [[Hong Kong]], or as an advocate and solicitor in [[Singapore]]. During the training period, the participant is known as a [[trainee solicitor]]&lt;ref name="ChambersWhatIs"&gt;[http://www.chambersstudent.co.uk/where-to-start/what-is-a-training-contract 'What is a training contract?'], ''Chambers Student''&lt;/ref&gt; or trainee lawyer (in Singapore).

A training contract can apply to any profession.  In some 21st-century contracts, a small number of contracts are secured by an Agency who represent many training professionals.  Otherwise training contracts can be negotiated locally.

==United Kingdom==
In the UK a full-time training contract is normally for two years, and applicants must have first completed the [[Legal Practice Course]].&lt;ref name="ChambersWhatIs" /&gt; [[Trainee solicitor]]s and training contracts were formerly known as [[articled clerk]]s and articles of clerkship, respectively. In the UK, the [[barrister]]'s equivalent is a twelve-month [[pupillage]] under a [[pupilmaster]], in [[chambers (law)|barristers' chambers]].

===Route===
To obtain a training contract (since 1st July 2014 a training contract was replaced by 'a period of recognised training'&lt;ref&gt;https://www.sra.org.uk/trainees/period-recognised-training.page&lt;/ref&gt;), a graduate must apply for an opening for such position at a law firm or in-house counsel, usually a year or two in advance of the start of planned employment. Many law firms offer vacation schemes (one- or two-week internships) as a lead-in to a training contract. The vacations schemes usually involve real work in one of the firm's departments, various assessment exercises and an interview. Vacation schemes students are normally paid.

A concern of the profession is that each year the number of applicants exceeds the number of contracts available.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.chambersstudent.co.uk/Articles/199|title=Trends affecting the legal recruitment market|website=Chambers Student|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120511125240/http://www.chambersstudent.co.uk/Articles/199|accessdate=28 November 2015|archivedate=2012-05-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; Graduates unable to obtain a training contract will have accrued sizeable debts with no guarantee of being able to qualify as a lawyer. In years past, it was common for aspiring lawyers to pay law firms to train them (a practice also common in other professions in the past, including officer positions in the [[Royal Navy]]).

===Legal executives===
For a [[legal executive]], who normally does not hold a [[law degree]], a training contract is not normally required to qualify as a solicitor. They typically advance toward qualification by passing exams administered by the [[Chartered Institute of Legal Executives]] (CILEx), while working under the supervision of a [[solicitor]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.chambersstudent.co.uk/Articles/200|title=Some other career options - Legal Executive|website=Chambers Student|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120511125127/http://www.chambersstudent.co.uk/Articles/200 |accessdate=28 November 2015|archivedate=2012-05-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Singapore==
In Singapore, a '''Practice Training Contract''' spans 6 months, and is normally undertaken after the applicant, who must be a "qualified person" under local legislation relating to the legal profession,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mlaw.gov.sg/practising-as-a-lawyer/admission/req/qp.html Am I a qualified person?] {{Webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20140214131011/http://www.mlaw.gov.sg/practising-as-a-lawyer/admission/req/qp.html |date=2014-02-14 }}, ''Ministry of Law (Singapore)''. Retrieved 14 February 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; has attended a 5-month practical law course, called the ''Preparatory Course leading to Part B of the Singapore Bar Examinations'' (or ''Part B Course''), and has passed ''Part B of the Singapore Bar Examinations'' (or ''Part B''),&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mlaw.gov.sg/practising-as-a-lawyer/admission/part-b.html Part B of the Bar Examinations] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140222174536/http://www.mlaw.gov.sg/practising-as-a-lawyer/admission/part-b.html |date=2014-02-22 }}, ''Ministry of Law (Singapore)''. Retrieved 14 February 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; although the reverse order is permissible.

A Practice Training Contract is a formal arrangement between a qualified person and a law practice for supervised training in relation to practicing law in Singapore.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20130908112602/http://www.mlaw.gov.sg/practising-as-a-lawyer/ptp.html Practice training period], ''Ministry of Law (Singapore)''. Retrieved 14 February 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; A qualified lawyer of at least 5 to 7 years' standing, known as a supervising solicitor, is responsible for the supervision of the practice trainee for the duration of the contract.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sile.org.sg/admission Singapore Institute of Legal Education; FAQs; Admissions], ''Singapore Institute of Legal Education''. Retrieved 14 February 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;

Upon the satisfactory completion of both the Practice Training Contract and Part B, the qualified person is, subject to certain other requirements, eligible to be admitted to practice law as an Advocate and Solicitor of the Supreme Court of Singapore (i.e. "called to the Singapore Bar").&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20140222174539/http://www.mlaw.gov.sg/practising-as-a-lawyer/admission/req/fulfil/admreq5.html Admission requirements], ''Ministry of Law (Singapore)''.

'''''United States v. Booker''''', 543 U.S. 220 (2005), is a [[Supreme Court of the United States|United States Supreme Court]] decision on criminals' sentences. The Court ruled that the [[Sixth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Sixth Amendment]] right to jury trial requires that other than a prior conviction, only facts admitted by a defendant or proved beyond a reasonable doubt to a jury may be used to calculate a sentence exceeding the prescribed statutory maximum sentence, whether the defendant has pleaded guilty or been convicted at trial. The maximum sentence that a judge may impose is based upon the facts admitted by the defendant or proved to a jury beyond a reasonable doubt.&lt;ref&gt;{{ussc|name=United States v. Booker|volume=543|page=220|pin=|year=2005}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

In its majority decision, the Court struck down the provision of the federal sentencing statute that required federal district judges to impose a sentence within the Federal Guidelines range, along with the provision that deprived federal appeals courts of the power to review sentences imposed outside the range. The Court instructed federal district judges to impose a sentence with reference to a wider range of sentencing factors set forth in the federal sentencing statute, and it directed federal appeals courts to review criminal sentences for "reasonableness," which the Court left undefined.

The ruling was the direct consequence of the Court's ruling six months earlier in ''[[Blakely v. Washington]]'', in which the Court had imposed the same requirement on a guidelines sentencing scheme employed in [[Washington (state)|Washington State]].&lt;ref&gt;{{ussc|name=Blakely v. Washington|volume=542|page=296|pin=|year=2004}}.&lt;/ref&gt; ''Blakely'' arose out of ''[[Apprendi v. New Jersey]]'' in which the Court held that except for a prior conviction, any fact that increases the defendant's punishment above the statutory maximum punishment must be submitted to a jury and proved beyond a reasonable doubt.&lt;ref&gt;{{ussc|name=Apprendi v. New Jersey|volume=530|page=466|pin=|year=2000}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==

===Booker===
In 2003, Freddie Joe Booker was arrested after police officers found 92.5&amp;nbsp;grams of crack cocaine in his duffel bag.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite court |litigants=United States v. Booker |vol=2003 |reporter=U.S. Dist. LEXIS |opinion=24609 |pinpoint= |court=[[W.D. Wis.]] |date=Sept. 5, 2003 |url=http://www.wiwd.uscourts.gov/opinions/pdfs/2003-2005/03-CR-26-S-09-05-03.pdf |accessdate=2018-11-24 |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt; He later gave a written statement to the police that admitted to selling an additional 566&amp;nbsp;grams of crack cocaine. In 2003, a jury in the [[US District Court]] for the Western District of Wisconsin found Booker guilty of possessing with intent to distribute at least 50&amp;nbsp;grams of cocaine [[base (chemistry)|base]]. Federal law provided for a statutory sentence of ten years to life in prison.&lt;ref&gt;{{USCSub|21|841|b|1|A|iii}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

At sentencing, the judge found by a [[preponderance of the evidence]] that the defendant (1) distributed 566&amp;nbsp;grams over and above the 100&amp;nbsp;grams that the jury had to have found and (2) had obstructed justice. Under the [[Federal Sentencing Guidelines]], that increased the defendant's base offense level from 32 to 36 (U.S.S.G. §§ 2D1.1(c)(2),(4)).&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt; made Booker's sentencing range of 30 years to life; the judge sentenced Booker to the minimum.

Booker appealed to the [[United States Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit]], claiming the sentencing guidelines violated his Sixth Amendment rights since the judge was able to find facts absent the findings of the jury, other than his criminal history, to determine his sentencing range. The Seventh Circuit affirmed Booker's conviction but found the application of the Guidelines violated the Sixth Amendment, as interpreted in ''Blakely'', and so reversed Booker's sentence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite court |litigants=United States v. Booker |vol=375 |reporter=F.3d |opinion=508 |pinpoint= |court=[[7th Cir.]] |date=2004 |url=https://law.justia.com/cases/federal/appellate-courts/F3/375/508/559646/ |accessdate=2018-11-24 |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Government appealed the Seventh Circuit's ruling to the Supreme Court.

===Fanfan===
Narcotics agents discovered 2.5&amp;nbsp;kilograms of cocaine and 281.6&amp;nbsp;grams of cocaine base in Ducan Fanfan's vehicle and arrested him. A jury in the US District Court for the [[District of Maine]] found that Fanfan had conspired to distribute and to possess with the intent to distribute at least 500&amp;nbsp;grams of cocaine, in violation of {{USC|21|846}}, {{USC|21|841(a)(1)}} and 841(b)(1)(B)(ii). The maximum sentence for Fanfan under the Federal Guidelines, without any additional findings, was 78 months in prison.

At sentencing, the judge, by a preponderance of the evidence, determined that Fanfan was responsible for 2.5&amp;nbsp;kilograms of cocaine powder and 261.6&amp;nbsp;grams of crack and was an organizer, leader, manager, or supervisor in the criminal activity. That would have resulted 188 to 235 months sentence under the Guidelines, which was a 10-year increase in the sentencing range from what the jury had found. The Supreme Court had issued ''Blakely'' four days before the judge imposed Fanfan's sentence. The sentencing judge, believing that ''Blakely'' had implications on federal judges increasing sentences on facts not found by juries, imposed the maximum sentence, 78 months, based on the jury's verdict. The government asked the judge to correct Fanfan’s sentence, which was denied.

===Consolidation===
The Government filed a notice of appeal in the [[United States Court of Appeals for the First Circuit]] and a petition for a [[writ of certiorari]] in the Supreme Court in the Fanfan case. Because of the importance of the case, the Supreme Court granted the petition as well as a similar petition filed by the government in Booker’s case, following the Seventh Circuit's ruling in favor of Booker. The Government asked the Court to determine whether ''Apprendi'' applied to the Sentencing Guidelines and which of the Guidelines were constitutional.

==Decision==
{{cleanup|section|date=March 2011}}
The decision of the Supreme Court was announced by two different groups of Justices.  [[John Paul Stevens|Justice Stevens]] wrote the majority opinion answering the question of whether the application of the Guidelines in these two cases violated the [[Sixth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Sixth Amendment]] as articulated in the ''Apprendi'' line of cases.  [[Stephen Breyer|Justice Breyer]] wrote the majority opinion answering the question of how to remedy the Sixth Amendment violation identified by the Court.

===Constitutional holding===
As applied to modern sentencing schemes, the Sixth Amendment demands that, other than the fact of a prior conviction, any fact that increases the defendant's punishment above the statutory maximum must be submitted to a jury and proved beyond a reasonable doubt.  The "statutory maximum" is the greatest sentence the judge can impose based solely on the jury's fact finding.  In a guidelines sentencing scheme that requires judges to impose a sentence within the guideline range, the jury-trial and reasonable-doubt requirements apply to the determination of any fact that exposes the defendant to punishment above the guideline range.

The Federal Sentencing Guidelines, like the Washington sentencing guidelines discussed in ''[[Blakely v. Washington|Blakely]]'', were mandatory; sentencing judges were required to impose sentences within the range dictated by the Guidelines.  In this sense, the decision in ''Blakely'' dictated the constitutional holding that the rule of ''Apprendi'', as construed in ''Blakely'', applies to the Federal Sentencing Guidelines.

The Government made three principal arguments against applying ''Blakely'' to the Federal Sentencing Guidelines, all of which the Court rejected:

1.  ''Commission vs. Legislature''

The Federal Sentencing Guidelines were promulgated by a [[Mistretta v. United States|sentencing commission]]; the Washington sentencing guidelines at issue in ''Blakely'', by contrast, were enacted by that state's legislature.  That distinction, the Court said, "lacked constitutional significance," because regardless of the body that set the rules, the rules required sentencing judges to increase sentences on the basis of particular facts not submitted to the jury and proved beyond a reasonable doubt.  "Regardless of whether the legal basis of the accusation [against the defendant] is in a statute or in guidelines promulgated by an independent commission, the principles behind the jury trial right are equally applicable" to each.

2.  ''[[Stare decisis]]''

The Government identified four recent cases that, it argued, precluded the Court from applying ''Blakely'' to the Guidelines under the principles of ''stare decisis''.  First, ''[[United States v. Dunnigan]]'', {{ussc|507|87|1993}}, held that the Guidelines provision that provided for an enhanced sentence if the defendant committed perjury during the trial did not violate the defendant's [[Fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Fifth Amendment]] privilege against self-incrimination.  In ''Dunnigan'', the Court had no occasion to consider whether the jury-trial right applied to that particular provision.  Furthermore, although a sentence based on such an enhancement had the potential to exceed the statutory maximum, this did not mean that the judge had to impose such a sentence.  "Thus, while the reach of ''Dunnigan'' may be limited, we need not overrule it."

Next, ''[[Witte v. United States]]'', {{ussc|515|389|1995}}, in which the Court held conduct that supported an enhancement in a prior case did not prevent a separate criminal prosecution for the same conduct, did not prevent applying ''Blakely'' to the Guidelines.  This was so because, ultimately, the conduct in the two respective cases was subject to two different burdens of proof.  The Court considered the converse of the ''Witte'' rule in ''[[United States v. Watts]]'', {{ussc|519|148|1997}}, where it held that conduct of which the defendant had been acquitted could nevertheless support a sentence enhancement under the Guidelines.  In neither case had the Court considered whether the sentence enhancements in question were subject to the jury-trial requirement.  "The issue we confront today simply was not presented."

Finally, ''[[Edwards v. United States]]'', {{ussc|523|511|1998}}, in which the Court allowed a sentence for a drug conspiracy involving both powder and crack cocaine to rest on both drugs in the face of a general verdict not specifying whether the jury believed the conspiracy involved either powder cocaine or crack cocaine or both, did not prevent the Court from applying ''Blakely'' to the Guidelines.  In ''Edwards'', the defendants could not have argued that the powder and crack cocaine were not part of the same overall conspiracy; hence, the Court's ruling in that case was not inconsistent with applying ''Blakely'' to the Guidelines.

3.  ''Separation of Powers''

The Government argued that applying the jury-trial requirement to sentencing enhancements promulgated by a commission would transform those enhancements into a criminal code, resulting in an unconstitutional delegation of legislative power to the judicial branch.  In ''[[Mistretta v. United States]]'', the Court had upheld the delegation of such legislative power to a body in the judicial branch, reasoning that the judicial branch had the power to exercise other quasi-legislative functions such as proposing rules of evidence and civil procedure for use in the federal courts.  The United States Sentencing Commission was not performing an adjudicatory function; rather, it was exercising a policy-making power appropriate for judicial officers and uniquely within their expertise.  This reasoning did not preclude applying ''Blakely'' to the Guidelines.

Thus, the Court ruled that the holding in ''Blakely'' applied to the Federal Sentencing Guidelines.

===Remedial holding===
The Court next confronted the question of a remedy for the constitutional violation.  A different majority of the Court concluded that 18 U.S.C. § 3553(b) &amp;mdash; the provision of the federal sentencing statute that required district courts to impose a sentence within the Guidelines range &amp;mdash; was "incompatible" with the constitutional holding and therefore had to be "severed and excised" from the statute.  Likewise, 18 U.S.C. § 3742(e), the provision that governed the handling of appeals from sentences, also had to be severed and excised, because that provision was inextricably linked with the provision that made the Guidelines mandatory.  The result of severing and excising these two provisions was to make the Guidelines "effectively advisory," such that district courts could, after considering the Guidelines range, tailor a sentence that reflected the broader range of concerns set forth in the federal sentencing statute.

The Court evaluated two possible remedies in light of Congress's intent in enacting the Guidelines system.  The first option, and the one preferred by the Justices who dissented from the remedial holding, "would engraft onto the existing system today's Sixth Amendment 'jury trial' requirement."  The second, the one the Court ultimately adopted, made the Guidelines advisory while at the same time "maintaining a strong connection between the sentence imposed and the offender's real conduct &amp;mdash; a connection important to the increased uniformity of sentencing that Congress intended its Guidelines system to achieve."  Although both remedies would "significantly alter the system that Congress designed," the remedial majority observed that it was not possible to "maintain the judicial factfinding that Congress thought would underpin the mandatory Guidelines system" in light of the jury factfinding requirement the constitutional majority had applied to that system.

''Why the Jury Factfinding Requirement Is Not Compatible with the Guidelines Scheme''

Several considerations persuaded the Court that Congress would not have enacted the Guidelines system and made it mandatory for federal district judges to apply if it had known that a jury factfinding requirement would apply to it.  First, the text of the sentencing statute required "the court" to consider "the nature and circumstances of the offense and the history and characteristics of the defendant" when imposing sentence.  In context, this meant "the judge sitting alone" instead of "the judge together with the jury."  When it was debating the Guidelines, Congress had intended for the judge to weigh the factors bearing on a defendant's sentence by himself.

Second, "Congress's basic statutory goal &amp;mdash; a system that diminishes sentencing disparity &amp;mdash; depends for its success upon judicial efforts to determine, and to base punishment upon, the ''real conduct'' that underlies the crime of conviction."  Many federal crimes are defined so broadly as to encompass a vast array of underlying conduct.  And other federal crimes, like robbery, can be committed in a variety of different ways.  Judges typically relied on presentence reports, which set forth the relevant conduct and offender characteristics, to assist them in determining what an appropriate sentence was.  Congress anticipated that, under the Guidelines, this practice would continue, and this expectation supported the Court's holdings in ''Witte'' and ''Watts''.  By contrast, imposing the jury factfinding requirement onto the Guidelines would "destroy the system" by "prevent[ing] a judge from relying on a presentence report for factual information, relevant to sentencing, uncovered after the trial," because such facts would necessarily not have been submitted to the jury during the course of the trial.  This, in turn, would "weaken the tie between a sentence and an offender's real conduct."

Imagine that both Smith and Jones violate the Hobbs Act, 18 U.S.C. § 1951(a), which forbids obstructing, delaying, or affecting commerce or the movement of any article or commodity in commerce by extortion.  Smith threatens to injure a co-worker if the co-worker does not advance him a few dollars from the interstate company's till.  Jones threatens to injure a co-worker unless the co-worker advances him a few thousand dollars from the company's accounts, and reinforces this threat by "making certain that the co-worker's family is aware of the threat, by arranging deliveries of various dead animals to the co-worker's home to show that he is serious, and so forth."  Both Smith and Jones, although they violated the same statute, created different harms as a result of their actions.  Under the Guidelines, their sentences would be different.  If the jury factfinding requirement were merely grafted onto the Guidelines scheme, unless prosecutors "decide to charge more than the elements of the crime," the judge would have to impose similar punishments.

Imagine next that two former felons, Johnson and Jackson, each threatened a bank teller with a gun, made off with $50,000, and injured an innocent bystander while fleeing the bank.  Suppose Johnson was charged with illegal possession of a firearm under 18 U.S.C. § 922(g), and Jackson was charged with bank robbery under 18 U.S.C. § 2113(a).  The Guidelines would have allowed a judge to impose similar sentences on both Johnson and Jackson, despite their being charged with different crimes.  Requiring the sentence-enhancing facts to be submitted to a jury undermines the ability of the Guidelines to achieve their goal of sentence uniformity, meaning uniformity of sentences imposed for the same real conduct, not for violations of the same statute.

Furthermore, imposing the jury-factfinding requirement onto the Guidelines would prove more complex than Congress could have intended.  Would the sentence enhancements have to be charged in the indictment?  How could a defendant defend against specific enhancements, such as that he used a gun during the crime, while simultaneously denying his guilt entirely?  The fact that the vast majority of criminal cases are resolved through plea bargains would not simplify things.  Instead, it would complicate them by increasing the likelihood that any agreed-upon sentence reflects more the skill of defense counsel and the prosecutor's policies than the real conduct underlying the offense.

Such a system "would have particularly troubling consequences with respect to prosecutorial power."  Because a prosecutor would control not only the charge to bring against the defendant but also the sentence enhancement, he would necessarily have the "power to decide, based on relevant information about the offense and the offender, which defendants merit heavier punishments."

Congress also would not have intended to craft a system that makes it more difficult to ratchet sentences upward than downward.  Yet imposing the jury-factfinding requirement on the Guidelines would have precisely that effect.  For all these reasons, the Court concluded that Congress would not have enacted the Guidelines as it did if it had known that many of the various sentence-enhancing factors would be subject to a jury-trial requirement.

''Which Parts of the Statute Should Be Excised?''

In order to eliminate the constitutional violation the Court had identified and at the same time tailor the federal sentencing statutes more closely to Congressional intent, the Court struck out 18 U.S.C. § 3553(b)(1), the provision of the sentencing statute that made it mandatory for district courts to impose sentences according to the Guidelines.  The rest of the sentencing statute "functioned independently."  It required district judges to "consider" the Guidelines sentencing range established for the applicable category of offense committed by the applicable category of defendant in order to impose a sentence that reflects the seriousness of the offense, promotes respect for the law, provides for adequate deterrence, protects the public, and provides the defendant with needed educational or vocational training or medical care.

Because the Court had struck out § 3553(b)(1), it also had to strike out 18 U.S.C. § 3742(e), the provision governing the standard for reviewing sentences on appeal.  This did not impose an unnecessary obstacle for handling appeals of sentences, for "a statute that does not ''explicitly'' set forth a standard of review may do so ''implicitly''."  Before the Court's decision in ''Booker'', § 3742(e) had instructed appellate courts to determine whether a sentence was "unreasonable" with respect to the Guidelines range.  After ''Booker'', the Court read the remaining provisions of the sentencing appeal statute to instruct appellate courts to determine whether sentences were "unreasonable" with respect to all the factors set forth in 18 U.S.C. § 3553(a) &amp;mdash; the statute spelling out which factors district courts were required to consider in fashioning a sentence in the first instance.  Though the Justices who dissented from the remedial holding called this standard unworkable, the Court reasoned that a standard of "reasonableness" was familiar from other areas of the law.  Together with the Sentencing Commission, which would still collect data about criminal sentencing, the courts of appeals together are able to maintain uniformity of criminal sentences.  Furthermore, if Congress was unsatisfied with this arrangement, it was free to amend the sentencing laws.

==Dissenting opinions==

===Stevens's opinion===
[[John Paul Stevens|Justice Stevens]] pointed out that it was possible to avoid the Sixth Amendment violation in Booker's case without making any changes to the Guidelines at all.&lt;ref&gt;Baron-Evans, Amy, "Booker Rules" (2012) University of Pennsylvania Law Review, vol. 160, 1631,  &lt;&lt;http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=1987041&gt;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Solely on the statute of conviction, the maximum Guidelines sentence Booker could have received was 262 months.  If the prosecution had submitted the quantity of drugs to the jury, the range would have increased to between 324 and 405 months.  Booker ultimately received a sentence of 360 months, one within the increased sentencing range and one which the sentencing judge could have imposed after evaluating Booker's criminal history and whether he had obstructed justice.  "Because the Guidelines as written possess the virtue of combining a mandatory determination of sentencing ranges and discretionary decisions within those ranges, they allow ample latitude for judicial factfinding that does not even arguably raise any Sixth Amendment issue."

But Stevens's principal objection was that the Court had crafted a new kind of severability analysis.  He started with the premise that all legislative enactments are presumed to be valid, and may only be struck down in their entirety if the law is unconstitutional in "all or nearly all of its applications," or if the invalid provision cannot be severed from the remainder of the statute.  Neither of those conditions applied to the federal sentencing laws, Stevens observed, and so there was no need to adopt a third method of curing constitutional violations.  After all, according to the Sentencing Commission, 45% of criminal sentences involve no enhancements whatsoever, and not all of the rest would actually implicate a defendant's Sixth Amendment rights.  Furthermore, defendants may waive their jury-trial rights, and so it follows that they may also waive their ''Blakely'' rights in appropriate situations.

These two observations led Stevens to the conclusion that only a "tiny portion" of criminal sentences imposed under the mandatory Guidelines scheme would actually implicate the ''Blakely'' rule.  In those cases, prosecutors, defense attorneys, and judges could cope.  Indeed, after ''Blakely'' was decided, the Department of Justice instructed prosecutors to include drug quantity allegations in the indictment.  Also, in many cases, Guidelines ranges overlap, and there would be no ''Blakely'' problem if the judge imposed a sentence within that overlapping range and based that sentence solely on judicial factfinding.  In light of these valid applications of mandatory Guidelines (constrained by ''Blakely''), Stevens saw no plausible way to say that the sentencing statute was unconstitutional in nearly all of its applications.

Stevens further envisioned no difficulty in applying ''Blakely'' to the Guidelines.  The word "court" could just as easily refer to the judge and jury together as it could to the judge alone.  Congress must presumably legislate within constitutional limitations, after all, and it was not plain from the language of the statute that this alternative interpretation was incompatible.  Stevens disputed that applying ''Blakely'' to the Guidelines would frustrate the goal of achieving uniformity in sentences based on real conduct, because judges retained discretion to impose sentences within prescribed ranges; if defendants pleaded guilty and waived their ''Blakely'' rights, the range within which the judge could exercise his discretion would necessarily increase.  Given the fact-based nature of certain sentence enhancements under the Guidelines &amp;mdash; drug quantity, firearm enhancements, and extent of injury or loss to the victim &amp;mdash; there was no reason juries could not make those determinations.  In complicated cases, prosecutors, defense attorneys, and judges together could be trusted to craft workable solutions.  To the extent prosecutors overstep their charging authority, judges retain the ability to reject unsatisfactory plea agreements.  In light of these objections, Stevens disputed that Congress would have preferred the majority's remedy to a solution of its own devising.

===Breyer's opinion===
[[Stephen Breyer|Justice Breyer]] reiterated his disagreement with the ''Apprendi'' rule, and then identified specific reasons not to apply the ''Blakely'' holding to the Federal Sentencing Guidelines.  The facts used to determine a defendant's sentence had historically been solely within a judge's purview, and the Federal Sentencing Guidelines should be treated no differently.  Creating a system that frustrated the goal of increased sentencing uniformity hardly seemed fair to defendants or to the public at large.  The fact that the Guidelines were administrative rules rather than statutes also was significant to Breyer.  And to the extent that the Guidelines did not adequately take into account an aggravating or [[mitigating factor|mitigating circumstance]], a judge was free to depart from the Guidelines range.  Thus, the defendant had every expectation that, despite the Guidelines, he might receive a sentence at or near the ''statutory'' maximum rather than at the top end of the Guidelines range.

===Scalia's opinion===
[[Antonin Scalia|Justice Scalia]] took issue with the Court's inferring a "reasonableness" standard of appellate review of sentences from the remainder of a statute from which it had excised the express statement that sentences should be reviewed for "reasonableness."  Traditionally, sentencing discretion was not reviewable on appeal.  When the Guidelines were enacted, appellate review was limited to discrete cases delineated by statute; appellate review was not plenary.  According to the text of the statute, the "power to review a sentence for reasonableness arises only when the sentencing court has departed from the applicable guideline range."  The situation here was not that the statute did not ''explicitly'' set forth a standard of review, but rather that the statute did explicitly set forth such a standard, but then excised from the statute the provision that established the standard.  Was it proper for the Court to "look for some congressional 'implication' of a ''different'' standard of review in the remnants of the statute that the Court has left standing?  Only in Wonderland."

Furthermore, it was not as easy for the courts to apply the "reasonableness" standard in the context of appellate review of sentences as the majority would have liked.  First, there was no history of applying that standard under the Guidelines regime.  Second, under the majority's holding that standard would apply across the board to all sentence appeals, including those that involved no legal error.  "The worst feature of the scheme is that no one knows &amp;mdash; and perhaps no one is meant to know &amp;mdash; how advisory Guidelines and 'unreasonableness' review will function in practice."

==Resentencings in light of ruling==
===Booker===
The lower courts had to revisit Booker's sentencing in light of the Supreme Court decision. He was resentenced by the same judge to the same 30-year sentence&lt;ref&gt;http://www.madison.com/archives/read.php?ref=/tct/2005/05/04/0505040314.php&lt;/ref&gt; (longer than the 21-year sentence the judge could have imposed if the guidelines not been made advisory); however, retroactive changes in crack cocaine guidelines meant that Booker's sentence has been reduced slightly by a federal judge (from 30 to 27 years),&lt;ref&gt;[http://sentencing.typepad.com/sentencing_law_and_policy/2009/01/though-booker-did-not-help-booker-making-the-reduced-crack-guielines-retroactive-did.html Though Booker did not help Booker, the reduced crack guidelines did]&lt;/ref&gt; and he has a projected release date of 20 June 2024.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bop.gov/iloc2/LocateInmate.jsp Federal Inmate Search]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Fanfan===
Fanfan was resentenced by the US District judge from 78 months to 210 months in prison. The new sentence was upheld on appeal by the US Court of Appeals.&lt;ref&gt;''United States v. Fanfan'', {{cite court |litigants=|vol=468 |reporter=F.3d |opinion=7 |pinpoint= |court=[[1st Cir.]] |date=2006 |url=https://www.leagle.com/decision/2006475468f3d71474 |accessdate=2018-11-24 |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt; His sentence was later reduced by the new federal sentencing guidelines for crack cocaine offenses.&lt;ref&gt;''United States v. Fanfan'', {{cite court |litigants=|vol=558 |reporter=F.3d |opinion=105 |pinpoint= |court=[[1st Cir.]] |date=2009 |url=https://www.leagle.com/decision/infco20090304088 |accessdate=2018-11-24 |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt; He has a projected release date of 13 June 2015.

==Criticism==
The decision has been criticized for fear that defendants and prosecutors will suffer from greater uncertainty and that some plea agreements will be entered into or rejected because of mistaken beliefs on the sentences that the judge will impose if the case is taken to trial or settled with a guilty plea.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=Judicial Participation in Plea Negotiations: A Comparative View|author=Jenia Iontcheva Turner|publisher=The American Journal of Comparative Law|volume=54|number=1|date=Winter 2006|pages=199–267}}&lt;/ref&gt;
