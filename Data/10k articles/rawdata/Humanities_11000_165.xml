"'''A Story of the Stone Age'''" is a [[short story]] written in 1897 by [[H. G. Wells]].

The story was featured in three parts between May and August 1897 in ''[[The Idler (1892–1911)|The Idler]]'' magazine, and was later released in collected editions. The story is set during the [[Stone Age]], and tells of a [[caveman]] named Ugh-lomi, who bonds with the young woman Eudena and kills his rival, the ''de facto'' tribal leader Uya. Whilst in exile, Ugh-lomi becomes the first man to ride a [[horse]], and to combine stone and wood to fashion an axe. He uses this weapon, along with his wits, to survive encounters with [[cave bear]]s, [[hyena]]s and [[rhinoceros|rhino]]s, and ultimately claim the position of tribal leader for himself.

'''Ahatanhel Yukhymovych Krymsky''' ({{lang-uk|Агатангел Юхимович Кримський}}, {{lang-ru|Агафангел Ефимович Крымский}}; {{OldStyleDate|15 January|1871|3 January}} – 25 January 1942) was an [[Ukraine|Ukrainian]] [[Oriental studies|Orientalist]], linguist and polyglot (knowing up to 35 languages), literary scholar, folklorist, writer, and translator. He was one of the founders of the [[National Academy of Sciences of Ukraine|All-Ukrainian Academy of Sciences]] (VUAN) in 1918 and a full member of it and of the [[Shevchenko Scientific Society]] from 1903.

== Life and career ==
Krymsky was born in [[Volodymyr-Volynskyi]] to a [[Lipka Tatars|Lipka Tatar]] father and an ethnic [[Poles|Polish]] mother.&lt;ref name="gazeta.ua"&gt;[http://gazeta.ua/articles/istoriya-movi/_shodoznavec-agatangel-krimskij-znav-do-sotni-mov/477261 Сходознавець Агатангел Кримський знав до сотні мов]{{ref-uk}}&lt;/ref&gt; His family moved soon to [[Zvenyhorodka]] in Central Ukraine. His surname "Krymsky" ({{lang-uk|Кримський}}) means "Crimean" and was received by an ancestor in the 17th century who was a [[Crimean Tatars|Crimean Tatar]] [[mullah]] from [[Bakhchysaray]].&lt;ref name="history.org.ua" &gt;[http://www.history.org.ua/?termin=Krimskii_A Енциклопедія історії України: Т. 5: Кон - Кю / Редкол.: В. А. Смолій (голова) та ін. НАН України. Інститут історії України. - К.: В-во «Наукова думка», 2008. - 568 с.: іл.]{{ref-uk}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was baptized into [[Eastern Orthodoxy]].&lt;ref name="history.org.ua" /&gt; Although Ahatanhel had no Ukrainian origin he described himself as "Ukrainophile".&lt;ref name="gazeta.ua" /&gt;&lt;ref name="history.org.ua" /&gt;

Krymsky graduated from Galagan College in [[Kiev]] in 1889, from the [[Lazarev Institute of Oriental Languages]] in [[Moscow]] in 1891, and subsequently from [[Moscow University]] in 1896. After graduation, he worked in the [[Middle East]] from 1896 to 1898, and subsequently returned to Moscow, where he became a lecturer at the Lazarev Institute, and, in 1900, a professor. Krymsky taught [[Arabic literature]] and Oriental history. In Moscow, he was active in the Ukrainian pro-independence movement and was a member of Moscow's Ukrainian [[Hromada]].&lt;ref name="history.org.ua" /&gt;&lt;ref name="ieu"&gt;[http://www.encyclopediaofukraine.com/display.asp?linkpath=pages\K\R\KrymskyAhatanhel.htm Krymsky, Ahatanhel. Internet Encyclopedia of Ukraine]&lt;/ref&gt;

In July 1918 Krymsky returned to Kiev and took part in the foundation of the [[National Academy of Sciences of Ukraine]] (VUAN). Eventually, he became the director of the Academy.&lt;ref name="ieu"/&gt; He edited 20 of the 25 volumes of ''Записки Історично-філологічного відділу'' ("Notes of the History and Philology Department") of the Academy (1920–29) and was a professor at [[Kiev University]] as well as the vice-president of the [[Ukrainian Science Society]] in Kiev from 1918. 

Although Krymsky survived the [[Great Purge]] of the 1930s, he was removed from scholarly and teaching activity for about 10 years. In 1939 he was rehabilitated,&lt;ref name="ieu"/&gt; but in July 1941 after the [[German-Soviet War|German-Soviet war]] began, the [[NKVD]] arrested him as "especially unreliable",&lt;ref name="history.org.ua" /&gt; and deported him to [[Kostanay]] in [[Kazakhstan]], where he died at the age of 71. He was finally rehabilitated in 1957.

== Activity ==
Krymsky was an expert in up to 34 languages;&lt;ref name="ieu"/&gt; some sources report that he had at least an average knowledge of 56 languages.&lt;ref name="parafia.org.ua"&gt;[http://www.parafia.org.ua/biblioteka/kultura/shenderovskyj-nehaj-ne-hasne-persha/vydatnyj-orijentalist-ukrajiny-ahyatanhel-krymskyj/ Видатний орієнталіст України — Агатангел Кримський] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140430053412/http://www.parafia.org.ua/biblioteka/kultura/shenderovskyj-nehaj-ne-hasne-persha/vydatnyj-orijentalist-ukrajiny-ahyatanhel-krymskyj/ |date=2014-04-30 }}{{ref-uk}}&lt;/ref&gt; Krymsky contributed few hundred entries to the Brockhaus, Efron, and Granat Russian encyclopedias and wrote many other works on Arabic, Turkish, Turkic, Crimean Tatar, and Iranian history and literature, some of which were pioneering textbooks in Russian Oriental studies.
[[File:Stamp of Ukraine s104.jpg|thumb|left|1996 Ukrainian commemorative stamp.]]

In particular he wrote, in Russian, histories of [[Islam]] (1904–12); of the Arabs, Turkey, Persia and their literatures, Dervish theosophy, and a study of the Semitic languages and peoples.&lt;ref name="ieu"/&gt; In the 1920s and 1930s he also wrote in Ukrainian histories of Turkey and Persia and their literatures; monographs on Hafiz and his songs and on the Turkic peoples, their languages, and literatures; and edited a collection of articles on the Crimean Tatars. With O. Boholiubsky he wrote a study of Arab higher education and the Arabian Academy of Sciences. During the last years of his life he wrote a six-volume history of the [[Khazar]]s, which was never published.&lt;ref name="ieu"/&gt;

Krymsky researched the history of the [[Ukrainian language]]. As he was an opponent of Aleksei Sobolevsky's claim that the language of the ancient [[Kyivan Rus’]] was more [[Russian language|Russian]], than Ukrainian,&lt;ref name="history.org.ua" /&gt; he wrote three polemical studies in 1904-07 on this question, later his views on the language of the Kyivan Rus were summarized in ''Українська мова, звідкіля вона взялася і як розвивалася'' ("The Ukrainian Language: Whence It Came and How It Developed"). Krymsky researched [[Ukrainian dialects]] and was actively involved in the work of standardizing the vocabulary and orthography of literary Ukrainian in the 1920s. In this activity he rejected the [[Galicia (Eastern Europe)|Galician]] orthographic tradition. He was the editor of the first two vols of the four-volume Russian-Ukrainian dictionary (1924–33) and of the Russian-Ukrainian dictionary of legal language (1926).&lt;ref name="ieu"/&gt;


Krymsky wrote three books of lyrical poetry and some [[novella]]s, and translated many Arabic and Persian literary works into Ukrainian, including [[Rubaiyat of Omar Khayyam|The Rubáiyát]] of [[Omar Khayyam]], [[One Thousand and One Nights]], and [[Hafez]]'s songs. He also translated the poetry of European writers such as [[Heinrich Heine]], [[Byron]], [[Sappho]], [[Friedrich Rückert]]. He published articles and reviews on Ukrainian writers, their works and on Ukrainian theater.&lt;ref name="ieu"/&gt;

As an ethnographer, Krymsky was an adherent of migration theory. He translated into Ukrainian and annotated [[William Alexander Clouston|W.A. Clouston]]'s ''Popular Tales and Fictions'' (1896) and also wrote many [[Orientalism|Orientalist]] works and articles about Ukrainian ethnographers.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="16661">'''Begadkefat''' (also '''begadkephat''', '''begedkefet''') is the name given to a phenomenon of [[lenition]] affecting the non-[[emphatic consonant|emphatic]] [[stop consonant]]s of [[Biblical Hebrew]] and [[Aramaic language|Aramaic]] when they are preceded by a vowel and not [[gemination|geminated]]. The name is also given to similar cases of spirantization of post-vocalic plosives in other [[language]]s; for instance, in the [[Berber languages|Berber language]] of [[Djerba]].&lt;ref&gt;See for instance: [[Werner Vycichl]], "Begadkefat im Berberischen", in: [[James Bynon|James]] and [[Theodora Bynon]] (eds.), ''Hamito-Semitica'', London 1975, pp. 315-317.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Irish language|Irish]] has a similar system.

The phenomenon is attributed to the following consonants:

The name of the phenomenon is made up with these six consonants, mixed with haphazard [[vowel]]s for the sake of pronunciation: BeGaDKePaT. The Hebrew term {{Hebrew|בֶּגֶ״ד כֶּפֶ״ת}} ([[Modern Hebrew]] {{IPA|/ˌbeɡedˈkefet/}}) denotes the letters themselves (rather than the phenomenon of spirantization).

Begedkefet spirantization developed sometime during the lifetime of Biblical Hebrew under the influence of Aramaic.&lt;ref&gt;Or perhaps [[Hurrian language|Hurrian]], but this is unlikely, c.f. Dolgoposky 1999, pp. 72-73.{{Citation not found|date=January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Its time of emergence can be found by noting that the Old Aramaic phonemes {{IPAslink|θ}}, {{IPAslink|ð}} disappeared in the 7th century BC.&lt;ref&gt;Dolgopolsky 1999, p. 72.{{Citation not found|date=January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; It persisted in Hebrew until the 2nd century CE.&lt;ref&gt;Dolgopolsky 1999, p. 73.{{Citation not found|date=January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Contradict-inline|article=Semitic languages#Consonants|date=October 2014}} During this period all six plosive / fricative pairs were [[Allophone|allophonic]].

In [[Modern Hebrew]] three of the six letters, {{hebrew|ב}} (bet), {{hebrew|כ}} (kaf) and {{hebrew|פ}} (pe) each still denote a [[stop consonant|stop]]–[[fricative consonant|fricative]] variant pair; these variants are, however, no longer purely [[allophone|allophonic]] (see [[#In Modern Hebrew|below]]). Although [[Orthography|orthographic]] variants of {{hebrew|ג}} (gimel), {{hebrew|ד}} (dalet) and {{hebrew|ת}} (tav) still exist, these letters' pronunciation always remains acoustically and phonologically indistinguishable.&lt;ref group=note&gt;In modern Hebrew, the letter gimel modified by the diacritic [[geresh]] – ג׳ – is pronounced as the [[affricate consonant|affricate]] {{IPAblink|dʒ}}; this, however, denotes a separate [[phoneme]], not connected to the phenomenon of spirantization: compare e.g. גז {{IPA|/'''ɡ'''ez/}} ("[[wool|fleece]]") ←→ ג׳ז {{IPA|/'''dʒ'''ez/}} ("[[jazz]]"); חג {{IPA|/χa'''ɡ'''/}} ("[[holiday]]") ←→ חג׳ {{IPA|/χa'''dʒ'''/}} ("the [[Hajj]]"). Conversely, dalet and tav with a geresh – ד׳ and ת׳ – respectively do denote the fricatives {{IPAblink|ð}} and {{IPAblink|θ}}, however never as sounds in Hebrew words or even [[loanword]]s, but are rather used exclusively for the [[wikt:Hebraize|hebraization]] of foreign language texts or the transliteration of foreign names. Also these modern Hebrew variants have nothing to do with the phenomenon of spirantization.&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Yiddish]], as well as in [[Ashkenazi Hebrew]]  (which was heavily influenced by Yiddish), {{hebrew|ת}} can denote a fricative variant, {{IPAblink|s}}.

==Orthography==
In [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]] [[Ktiv menuqad|writing with niqqud]], a dot in the center of one of these letters, called [[dagesh]] &lt;span style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:bidi-override"&gt;(&amp;nbsp;ּ&amp;nbsp;)&lt;/span&gt;, marks the plosive articulation:
* at the beginning of a word{{#tag:ref|In Hebrew texts that are not modern, begedkefet letters at the beginning of a word ''preceded by a vowel'' are sometimes written without a dagesh and therefore pronounced as fricatives, e.g. "אֲשֶׁר־בּוֹ פְרִי־עֵץ" ({{IPA|/aʃer bo '''f'''ri ʕets/}}, [[Book of Genesis|Genesis]] 1, 29), but not always – e.g. "עֹשֶׂה פְּרִי" ({{IPA|/ʕose '''p'''ri/}}, Genesis 1, 11 and 1, 12).&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleref|Gen|1|HE}}, Mechon Mamre.&lt;/ref&gt; This is governed by the stress and [[cantillation]] mark of the preceding word, but the detailed rules are beyond the scope of this article.|group=note}} or after a consonant (in which cases it is termed "dagesh qal"&lt;ref group=note&gt;In modern Hebrew [[ktiv menuqad]], the dagesh qal is marked also in the three begedkefet letters which can no longer denote a fricative variant – [[ג]] ({{IPAblink|ɡ}}), [[ד]] ({{IPAblink|d}}) and [[ת]] ({{IPAblink|t}}) – conserving the [[Masoretes|masoretic]] [[niqqud]] tradition.&lt;/ref&gt;),
* when the sound is – or was historically – [[gemination|geminated]] (in which case it is termed "dagesh ẖazaq", a mark for historical gemination in most other consonants of the language as well), and
* in some modern Hebrew words independently of these conditions (see below).

A line (similar to a [[Macron (diacritic)|macron]]) placed above it, called "[[rafe]]" &lt;span style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:bidi-override"&gt;(&amp;nbsp;&lt;big&gt;ֿ&lt;/big&gt;&amp;nbsp;)&lt;/span&gt;, marks in Yiddish (and rarely in Hebrew) the fricative articulation.

==In Modern Hebrew==
As mentioned above, the fricative variants of {{IPAblink|ɡ}}, {{IPAblink|d}} and {{IPAblink|t}} no longer exist in modern Hebrew.  (However, Hebrew ''does'' have the [[guttural R]] consonant {{IPAslink|ʁ}} which is the voiced counterpart of {{IPAslink|χ}} and often coincides with [[Mizrahi Hebrew]]'s fricative variant of {{IPAblink|ɡ}} ḡimel as well as [[Arabic]]'s غ ġayn, both of which are {{IPAslink|ɣ}}~{{IPAslink|ʁ}}. Modern Hebrew ר resh can still sporadically be found standing in for this phoneme, for example in the Hebrew rendering of [[Raleb Majadele|Raleb (Ghaleb) Majadele]]'s name.)  The three remaining pairs {{IPAslink|b}}~{{IPAslink|v}}, {{IPAslink|k}}~{{IPAslink|χ}}, and {{IPAslink|p}}~{{IPAslink|f}} still sometimes [[Alternation (linguistics)|alternate]], as demonstrated in [[inflection]]s of many [[Semitic root|root]]s in which the roots' meaning is retained despite variation of begedkefet letters' [[manner of articulation]], e.g.,

|}
however, in Modern Hebrew, stop and fricative variants of {{Hebrew|[[ב]]}}{{rtl}}, {{Hebrew|[[כ]]}} and {{Hebrew|[[פ]]}} are sometimes distinct phonemes, compare e.g.:
{|cellspacing=0 cellpadding=0 style="white-space:nowrap; border-style:none"
|{{•}}{{Hebrew|אִפֵּר – אִפֵר}}||&lt;span style="margin-left:5px;margin-right:5px;background-color:#e7e7e7"&gt;{{IPA|/iˈ'''p'''eʁ/}} – {{IPA|/iˈ'''f'''eʁ/}}&lt;/span&gt;||("applied make up" – "tipped ash"),

|-
|{{•}}{{Hebrew|הִשְׁתַּבֵּץ – הִשְׁתַּבֵץ}}||&lt;span style="margin-left:5px;margin-right:5px;background-color:#e7e7e7"&gt;{{IPA|/hiʃtaˈ'''b'''ets/}} – {{IPA|/hiʃtaˈ'''v'''ets/}}&lt;/span&gt;||("got integrated" – "was shocked"),
|}
and consider, e.g.:
{|cellspacing=0 cellpadding=0 style="border-style:none"
|style="vertical-align:top; padding-right:3px"|{{•}}&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;||{{hebrew|לככב}} "to star", whose common pronunciation {{IPA|/le'''k'''aˈ'''χ'''ev/}} preserves the [[manner of articulation]] of each [[Kaph|kaf]] in the word it is [[morphological derivation|derived]] from: {{hebrew|כּוֹכָב}} {{IPA|/'''k'''oˈ'''χ'''av/}} "a star" (first stop, then [[Fricative consonant|fricative]]), as opposed to the [[linguistic prescription|prescribed]] pronunciation {{IPA|/le'''χ'''aˈ'''k'''ev/}}, which regards the variation in pronunciation of kaf {{IPAslink|χ}} ←→ {{IPAslink|k}} as allophonic and determines its manner of articulation according to historical phonological principles; or:
|-
|style="vertical-align:top; padding-right:3px"|{{•}}&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;||similarly, {{hebrew|לרכל}} "to gossip", whose prescribed pronunciation {{IPA|/leʁaˈkel/}} is [[Colloquialism|colloquially]] rejected, commonly pronounced {{IPA|/leʁaˈχel/}}, preserving the fricative manner of articulation in related nouns (e.g. {{hebrew|רכילות}} {{IPA|/ʁeχiˈlut/}} "gossip", {{hebrew|רכלן}} {{IPA|/ʁaχˈlan/}} "gossiper").
|}
This phonemic divergence might be due to a number of factors, amongst others:
*due to loss of consonant gemination in modern Hebrew, which formerly distinguished the stop members of the pairs from the fricatives when intervocalic – e.g. in the [[inflection]]s:
:{|cellspacing=0 cellpadding=0 style="white-space:nowrap; border-style:none"
|{{•}}{{Hebrew|קפץ ← קיפץ}}||&lt;span style="margin-left:5px;background-color:#e7e7e7"&gt;{{IPA|/kaˈ'''f'''ats/ → /kiˈ'''p'''ets/}},&lt;/span&gt; historically &lt;span style="margin-right:5px;background-color:#e7e7e7"&gt;{{IPA|/ki'''p'''ˈ'''p'''ets/}}&lt;/span&gt;||("jumped" → "hopped"),
|-
|{{•}}{{Hebrew|שבר ← שיבר}}||&lt;span style="margin-left:5px;background-color:#e7e7e7"&gt;{{IPA|/ʃaˈ'''v'''ar/ → /ʃiˈ'''b'''er/}},&lt;/span&gt; historically &lt;span style="margin-right:5px;background-color:#e7e7e7"&gt;{{IPA|/ʃi'''b'''ˈ'''b'''er/}}&lt;/span&gt;||("broke" → "shattered"),
|-
|{{•}}{{Hebrew|שכן ← שיכן}}||&lt;span style="margin-left:5px;background-color:#e7e7e7"&gt;{{IPA|/ʃaˈ'''χ'''an/ → /ʃiˈ'''k'''en/}},&lt;/span&gt; historically &lt;span style="margin-right:5px;background-color:#e7e7e7"&gt;{{IPA|/ʃi'''k'''ˈ'''k'''en/}}&lt;/span&gt;||("resided" → "housed"),
|}
*due to the introduction, through [[loanword|foreign borrowings]], of:
:{{•}}syllable-initial {{IPAslink|f}} (e.g. {{hebrew|פברק}} &lt;span style="background-color:#e7e7e7"&gt;{{IPA|/'''f'''ibˈʁek/}}&lt;/span&gt; "fabricated"),
:{{•}}non-syllable-initial {{IPAslink|p}}  (e.g. {{hebrew|הפנט}} &lt;span style="background-color:#e7e7e7"&gt;{{IPA|/hi'''p'''ˈnet/}}&lt;/span&gt; "hypnotized")
:{{•}}non-syllable-initial {{IPAslink|b}} (e.g. {{hebrew|פברק}} &lt;span style="background-color:#e7e7e7"&gt;{{IPA|/fi'''b'''ˈʁek/}}&lt;/span&gt; "fabricated"), ג׳וֹבּ &lt;span style="background-color:#e7e7e7"&gt;{{IPA|/dʒo'''b'''/}}&lt;/span&gt; "job", {{hebrew|קוּבּ}} &lt;span style="background-color:#e7e7e7"&gt;{{IPA|/ku'''b'''/}}&lt;/span&gt; "cubic meter", {{hebrew|פָּאבּ}} &lt;span style="background-color:#e7e7e7"&gt;{{IPA|/pa'''b'''/}}&lt;/span&gt; "pub").

Apart from this partial phonemic distinction, common Israeli pronunciation no longer always concords with the original [[phonology|phonological]] principle "stop variant after a consonant; fricative after a vowel", although this principle is still [[linguistic prescription|prescribed]] as standard by the [[Academy of the Hebrew Language]], e.g.:
* The words {{hebrew|מעבורת}} ([[ferry]]) and {{hebrew|מעברות}} ([[Ma'abarot|refugee absorption camps]]), whose respective prescribed pronunciation is &lt;span style="white-space:nowrap"&gt;{{IPA|/maʕˈ'''b'''oʁet/}}&lt;/span&gt; and {{IPA|/maʕ'''b'''aˈʁot/}}, are commonly pronounced {{IPA|/ma.aˈ'''b'''oʁet/}} and {{IPA|/ma.a'''b'''aˈʁot/}}, replacing the consonant ({{IPAslink|ʕ}}) with a vowel ([[Open central unrounded vowel|{{IPA|/a/}}]]), but still preferring the stop variant {{IPAslink|b}} to its fricative counterpoint {{IPAslink|v}}.
* Similarly, the words {{hebrew|העפלה}} ([[Aliyah Bet]], called the Ha'apalim which designates the covert Jewish immigration to British Palestine, 1934-1948) and {{hebrew|מעפילים}} (the immigrants of this immigration), whose respective prescribed pronunciation is {{IPA|/haʕ'''p'''aˈla/}} and {{IPA|/maʕ'''p'''iˈlim/}}, are commonly pronounced {{IPA|/ha.a'''p'''aˈla/}} and {{IPA|/ma.a'''p'''iˈlim/}}, again replacing the consonant ({{IPAslink|ʕ}}) with the vowel ([[Open central unrounded vowel|{{IPA|/a/}}]]), but still preferring the stop {{IPAslink|p}} to the fricative {{IPAslink|f}}.
* Conversely, words like {{Hebrew|להכחיש}} (to deny) or {{Hebrew|מכחול}} (paintbrush), whose respective prescribed pronunciation is {{IPA|/leha'''χ'''ˈħiʃ/}} and {{IPA|/mi'''χ'''ˈħol/}}, are commonly pronounced {{IPA|/leha'''k'''ˈχiʃ/}} and {{IPA|/mi'''k'''ˈχol/}}, preferring the stop {{IPAslink|k}} to the fricative {{IPAslink|χ}}, although following vowels (respectively [[Open central unrounded vowel|{{IPA|/a/}}]] and {{IPAslink|i}}), due to the shifting of the original semitic pronunciation of the letter {{hebrew|ח}} ([[heth]]) from {{IPAslink|ħ}} to {{IPAslink|χ}}, rendering it identical to common Israeli pronunciation of the fricative variant of the letter {{hebrew|כ}}.

This city is located between [[Incheon]] and [[Seoul]].

Bucheon is the second most densely populated city in South Korea after Seoul,&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.heraldcorp.com/view.php?ud=20160516000533 |script-title=ko:부천시, 상동 영상단지 내 초대형 신세계 복합쇼핑몰 건립 ‘논란’… 시민단체 ‘반발’|first=|last=헤럴드경제|date=16 May 2016|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and as a result, administrative districts were abolished in July 2016 in favor of providing greater public service in community centers.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;

== Modern history ==
In 1914, outer areas of [[Incheon]] City (including former city centre of Gwangyo-dong of old Incheon) and [[Bupyeong District#History of "old Bupyeong"|Bupyeong County]] were joined together under the name ''Bucheon''. In 1931, Gyenam township (''myeon'', 계남면) was renamed Sosa township (''myeon'', 소사면). In 1936,  the westernmost part of Bucheon which were part of old Incheon (including the former Incheon city centre of Gwangyo-dong) was incorporated in Incheon City and in 1940 some other part of old Incheon belonging to Bucheon Country was incorporated in Incheon again while part of old Bupyeong was annexed to Incheon at the same time. In 1941, Sosa township promoted to ''eup'' (town) status.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

In 1988, two districts were established. Bucheon was divided into Nam-gu ("south", {{Korean|남구|labels=no}}) and Jung-gu ("central", {{Korean|중구|labels=no}}) along the Seoul-Incheon trainline. Present day Sosa-gu was formerly called Nam-gu.

In 1993, Bucheon's Jung-gu was separated into two further districts, forming [[Wonmi-gu|Wonmi]] ({{Korean|원미구|labels=no}}) and [[Ojeong-gu|Ojeong]] ({{Korean|오정구|labels=no}}) Districts.

'''Notes on Writing Systems'''
# LPO, the linguistic [[Phonetics|phonetic]] orthography, is a third orthographic system based on a variant of the [[International Phonetic Alphabet|International Phonetic Alphabet (IPA)]]. Many Salishan scholars, such as Lyon Greenwood, call the LPO orthography the Salishan orthography. This system will also be used by the Coeur d'Alene Dictionaries Project in conjunction with the Bitar system.&lt;ref name="doakmont2000"&gt;Doak, I. G., &amp; Montler, T. (2000). Orthography, lexicography and language change. Proceedings of the fourth FEL Conference. Charlotte, NC: Foundation for Endangered Languages.&lt;/ref&gt;
# Bitar is another name referring to Lawrence Nicodemus's orthography.&lt;ref name="doakmont2000" /&gt; Lawrence Nicodemus was one of [[Gladys Reichard]]'s language consultants, and in collaboration with Joseph Bitar of the Southwest Research Associates of Albuquerque, he created a second orthography, which is less accurate phonetically but reflects the native speaker's interpretation of the sounds, symbols, and words of Coeur d'Alene.&lt;ref name="doakmont2000" /&gt; 
# [[Gladys Reichard]] and [[James Teit]], students of [[Franz Boas]]. Reichard conducted early scholarly work of the Coeur d'Alene. Reichard and Teit developed an orthographic system, slightly varied from the Boasian system, which was consistent with phonetic transcriptions of native speakers Reichard worked with as well as consistent with transcriptions from Teit's previous data. This system has come to be known as the Reichard orthography.&lt;ref name="doakmont2000" /&gt; 
#  In Doak and Montler,&lt;ref name="doakmont2000" /&gt; /e/ is used in the LPO orthography, equated with /ɛ/. Doak&lt;ref name="doak97"&gt;Doak, I. G. (1997). Coeur d'Alene grammatical relations (Doctorate dissertation). Austin, TX: University of Texas at Austin.&lt;/ref&gt; explains that /ɛ/ ranges freely between [e], [ɛ], and [æ] with /ɛ/ being the most common variant. This gives clarity to her variance in representing the sound in [[vowel]] inventories of her website and her dissertation as /e/ or /ɛ/. 
# Doak and Montler,&lt;ref name="doakmont2000" /&gt; Doak,&lt;ref name="doak97" /&gt; and Doak&lt;ref name="doakmont2006"&gt;Doak, I. G., &amp; Montler, T. (2006).

Douglas Lake Okanagan: Phonology and Morphology. M.A. thesis, University of British Columbia.&lt;/ref&gt; also utilizes the wedge notation for this same phoneme: /x̌/. 
# Standard Salishan (LPO)&lt;ref name="doakmont2000" /&gt; and Doak&lt;ref name="doak97" /&gt;&lt;ref name="doakmont2006" /&gt; uses the notation /ɬ/ while Lyon,&lt;ref name="lyon2005" /&gt; and Greenwood,&lt;ref name="lyongreen2007"&gt;Lyon, J., &amp; Greene-Wood, R.

Missoula, MT: UMOPL.&lt;/ref&gt; Nicodemus et al.,&lt;ref name="Nicodemus, L. 2000"/&gt; and Reichard used the notation /ł/ in consonant inventories and orthographies in reference to the same sound which Doak&lt;ref name="doak97" /&gt; describes as bilateral.

==Phonology==
===Consonants===
In Coeur d'Alene, there are eleven places of articulation: labial, alveolar, alveopalatal, lateral, labiovelar, uvular, labio-uvular, coronal pharyngeal, pharyngeal, labiopharyngeal, and laryngeal.&lt;ref name="doakmont2000" /&gt;&lt;ref name="doak97" /&gt; Doak identifies six manners of articulation: plain and glottalized voiceless stops and affricates, voiced stops and affricate, voiceless fricatives, and plain and glottalized resonants.&lt;ref name="doak97" /&gt;&lt;ref name="doakmont2006" /&gt;&lt;ref name="lyon2005" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Bischoff11"&gt;Bischoff, S.

'''Notes on vowel inventory'''
# Doak&lt;ref name="doak97" /&gt; explains that /ɛ/ ranges freely between [e], [ɛ], and [æ] with /ɛ/ being the most common variant. Above, the phoneme /e/ has been used as Doak&lt;ref name="doakmont2006" /&gt; does.
# The schwa /ə/ only occurs unstressed as a reduced form of some unstressed vowels.&lt;ref name="doakmont2006" /&gt; It is also used by speakers to break up consonant clusters.

==Morphology and Syntax==

Coeur d'Alene is a morphosyntactically polysynthetic language. In Coeur d'Alene, a full clause can be expressed by affixing pronominal arguments and morphemes expressing aspect, transitivity and tense onto one verb stem (Doak,[13] 1997, p.&amp;nbsp;38). These affixes are discussed below.

===Basic Intransitive Clause Structure===
The basic format of an intransitive thought as Doak&lt;ref name=doak97 /&gt; identifies can be found below: 
{|
|-
| Subject – Aspect – Root
|}

===Intransitive Person Markers===
The intransitive subjects of Coeur d'Alene appear as clitics (Doak,&lt;ref name=doak97 /&gt; 1997, p.&amp;nbsp;53), and their forms as well as examples from Doak (1997,&lt;ref name=doak97 /&gt; p.&amp;nbsp;53-54) are found below:

|}

====Examples====
{|
|align="center" colspan="3"| (1) Intransitive Forms
|-
|align="left"| a) '''čn'''gʷič||||||align="left"|‘I saw.’
|-
|align="left"| b) '''kʷu'''gʷič||||||align="left"| ‘You saw.’
|-
|align="left"| c) gʷič||||||align="left"|‘He saw.’
|-
|align="left"| d) '''č'''gʷič||||||align="left"|‘We saw.’
|-
|align="left"| e) '''kʷup'''gʷič||||||align="left"|‘You folks saw.’
|-
|align="left"| f) gʷič('''ilš''')||||||align="left"|‘They saw.’
|}

===Plural –ilš===
To clarify, the parentheses used around the suffix, -ilš, are meant to show that it is optional. This 3rd person plural, optional morpheme is used to give clarity that something within the sentence has plurality, whether it is the subject or the object is a matter of context. To illustrate this more clearly, Doak (1997,&lt;ref name=doak97 /&gt; p.&amp;nbsp;59) gives the example:
{|
|colspan="6"| (1) ʔácqʔəmstusilš
|-
| √ʔacqɛʔ||-m||-st(u)||-Ø||-s||'''-ilš'''
|-
| √go.out||-m||-ct||-3abs||-3erg||'''-pl'''
|-
|colspan="6" align="center"| ‘He took them out.’/ ‘They took it out.’ / ‘They took them out.’
|}

===Determiners===
There are three determiners and one [[Oblique case|oblique marker]] that help specify participants by joining clauses and their main predicates. Doak (1997,&lt;ref name=doak97 /&gt; p.&amp;nbsp;46-48).

{| class="wikitable"
|-
! Det !! label   !! example
|-
| xʷε || det₁    || examples 2,3,4
|-
| cε  || det₂    ||  example 4
|-
| ɬε  || det₃    || example 1
|-
| Ɂε  || oblique || example 3
|}

As a general rule, adjuncts that are introduced with a determiner specify the [[Absolutive case|absolutive]], [[Accusative case|accusative]] and [[Nominative case|nominative]] pronominal arguments, while both the determiner and [[Oblique case|oblique marker]] introduce [[Ergative case|ergative]] arguments. When an indefinite participant is not indicated on the predicate, the [[Oblique case|oblique]] alone is used to indicate this participant. Doak (1997,&lt;ref name=doak97 /&gt; p.&amp;nbsp;vii)

Examples:

(1)
ɬuɁ  /  niɁt̓εk̓ʷus  /  ɬa  /  stqʷíl̇k̇ʷup  
 
prox₃ / lay.in.fire / det₃ /  fire

He lay in the fire                                 Doak (1997,&lt;ref name=doak97 /&gt; p.&amp;nbsp;47)

(2)

The horse likes to chase.                   Doak (1997,&lt;ref name=doak97 /&gt; p.&amp;nbsp;46)

(4)	
xʷε /  Ɂε  /   núnεɁs        /        hiɬ  /  cε    /    pípεɁs…

det₁ / obl  / their.mother    /        and /  det₂  /   their.father…

Their mother and their father ...        Doak (1997,&lt;ref name=doak97 /&gt; p.&amp;nbsp;46)

===Basic Transitive Clause Structure===
The construction of a transitive sentence in Coeur d'Alene&lt;ref name=doak97 /&gt; is:

{|
|-
| Aspect – Root – Transitivizer – Object – Subject
|}

===Transitivizers===
There are three types of transitives in Coeur d'Alene: simple, causative, and applicative. The different transitivizers in Coeur d'Alene are listed below as described by Bischoff (2011,&lt;ref name=Bischoff11 /&gt; p.&amp;nbsp;27 modified).

|-
| -tułt
|-
| -š(i)t
|}

====The Lone -t and Directive -nt Transitivizers====
The lone -t (-t) and the directive transitivizer -nt (-dt) are the most commonly used in Coeur d'Alene (Bischoff,&lt;ref name=Bischoff11 /&gt; 2011, p.&amp;nbsp;27). Doak (1997,&lt;ref name=doak97 /&gt; p.&amp;nbsp;115) suggests that these two are alternative forms of one another with the lone -t appearing before a limited number of roots. The person markers that follow these forms are the same in function and form: agent subjects and patient objects. Most often, these transitivizers indicate that the subject is an agent in control of his or her actions (Bischoff,&lt;ref name=Bischoff11 /&gt; 2011, p.&amp;nbsp;27).

|-
| colspan="4" align="center"| 'He was given it.' (Bischoff,&lt;ref name=Bischoff11 /&gt; 2011, p.&amp;nbsp;28)||||||
|}

====Causative Transitivizer -st(u)====
The causative transitivizer -st(u) (-ct) has three primary functions. It is used to indicate customary aspect, causative construction where the subject causes something or someone to be something, and topical object construction (Doak,&lt;ref name=doak97 /&gt; 1997, p.&amp;nbsp;124). A unique set of m-initial objects for first and second person singular replace the s-initial morphemes when the construction is with a causative -st(u) transitivizer (Bischoff,&lt;ref name=Bischoff11 /&gt; 2011, p.&amp;nbsp;29).

=====Examples=====
{|
| colspan="5"| (1) ʔɛcɡʷíčstmit||||||||
|-
| ʔɛc- ||√ɡʷíč||'''-st(u)'''||-mi||-t
|-
| cust-||√see||'''-ct'''||-2acc||-1perg

|-
| colspan="5" align="center"| 'He took me there.' (Doak,&lt;ref name=doak97 /&gt; 1997, p.&amp;nbsp;125-126)||||||||
|}

====Applicative transitivizers====
Applicative transitivizers introduce a third participant into the argument structure, and alter the role of the object. This means the participant represented by the object person marking morpheme serves as a possessor or dative with the possessor applicative transitivizer -łt (-pra) and as a beneficiary or dative with the benefactive transitivizer -š(i)t (-bt). There is also a third, much less frequent, applicative -tułt. can also indicate a dative construction, indicating the object to which something is given. It is also worthwhile to note that third person arguments are only understood from context because Coeur d'Alene only marks two arguments on the predicate using person marking morphemes (Bischoff,&lt;ref name=Bischoff11 /&gt; 2011, p.&amp;nbsp;30).

====Possessor Applicative Transitivizer -łt====
In transitive constructions with the possessor applicative -łt (-pra), the object marking on the predicate indicates the possessor, rather than the possessed, such as in Examples 1a and 1b below. In some cases, as in Example 1c below, -łt (-pra) serves to indicate a dative construction. In these cases, the role of the object shifts to dative (Bischoff,&lt;ref name=Bischoff11 /&gt; 2011, p.&amp;nbsp;30-31).

|}

====Benefactive Applicative Transitivizer -š(i)t====
In constructions with the benefactive applicative -š(i)t (-bt), the argument indicated by the ergative is agent and that  by accusative/absolutive the beneficiary. The benefactive applicative may also function to characterize an object as a recipient (Bischoff,&lt;ref name=Bischoff11 /&gt; 2011, p.&amp;nbsp;31).

=====Examples=====
{|
| colspan="4"| (1) nkʷínšicn||||||

|-
| √sing||'''-bt'''||-2acc||-1erg
|-
| colspan="4" align="center"| 'I sang to you.' (Doak,&lt;ref name=doak97 /&gt; 1997, p.&amp;nbsp;156)||||||
|}

====Dative Applicative Transitivizer -tułt====
The dative applicative -tułt is very rare, and the role of this applicative is uncertain other than that it introduces another participant into a sentence structure (Doak,&lt;ref name=doak97 /&gt; 1997, p.&amp;nbsp;157). The only examples Doak&lt;ref name=doak97 /&gt; gives only occur with third person or non-topic ergative person marking morphemes (Bischoff,&lt;ref name=Bischoff11 /&gt; 2011, p.&amp;nbsp;32).

===Transitive Person Markers===
Below are the transitive object morphemes, which appear as suffixes. The 3rd person is null. The following examples are taken from Doak (1997,&lt;ref name=doak97 /&gt; p.&amp;nbsp;55-64).

'''Notes on Transitive Objects'''
#The alternate forms of the 1st person singular accusative -sɛl/-mɛl and 2nd person singular accusative -si/-mi are selected with respect to the transitivizer used in the predicate, those occurring with m primarily occur with the causative transitivizer -st(u)- while all other transitivizers take those with s form. (Bischoff,&lt;ref name=Bischoff11 /&gt; 2011, p.&amp;nbsp;16)
#The /l/ in parentheses indicates optionality in phonetic articulation, due to phonological reductions. The phoneme /l/ appears as in examples 1a and 1b before the non-topic ergative object -m and with the 2nd person plural ergative subject -p.

===Aspect===
There are three aspects in Coeur d'Alene. The first is the completive, which has no morpheme marker. The completive aspect refers to an action that was completed in the past (Bischoff, 2011,&lt;ref name=Bischoff11 /&gt; p.&amp;nbsp;22; Reichard, 1938,&lt;ref&gt;Reichard, G. A. (1938). Coeur d'Alene. In F. Boas, Handbook of American Indian languages Part 3 (pp. 515–707). New York: J. J. Augustin, Inc.&lt;/ref&gt; p.&amp;nbsp;574).

|-
| align="center" colspan="3"| 'I smoked.' (Doak, 1997,&lt;ref name=doak97 /&gt; p.&amp;nbsp;83)
|}
The second is the customary aspect, characterized by the prefix morpheme, ʔɛc- (Doak, 1997,&lt;ref name=doak97 /&gt; p.&amp;nbsp;85). 
{|

The third aspect is the continuative, indicated by the prefix morpheme y’c-.

|}
Tense
In addition to aspect in Coeur d'Alene, there is evidence of realis and irrealis. Realis and irrealis marks a distinction between time that the speaker can directly perceive through his or her own knowledge or senses (realis)  and that which is conjectured  known of hypothetically, distantly, or by  hearsay (irrealis). Only examples of irrealis are attested in Coeur d'Alene (Doak 1997,[13]  p.&amp;nbsp;188).

Irrealis is indicated in the same way as an aspect marker, by a particle occurring before the verb. The irrealis particle is  nεʔ. There are no examples of both an aspect marker and irrealis occurring in the same predicate (Doak 1997, [13] p.&amp;nbsp;189).

'''Copán''' is an archaeological site of the [[Maya civilization]] located in the [[Copán Department]] of western [[Honduras]], not far from the border with [[Guatemala]]. It was the capital city of a major [[Mesoamerican chronology|Classic period]] kingdom from the 5th to 9th&amp;nbsp;centuries AD. The city was located in the extreme southeast of the [[Mesoamerica]]n cultural region, on the frontier with the [[Isthmo-Colombian]] cultural region, and was almost surrounded by non-[[Maya peoples]].&lt;ref name="Sharer &amp; Traxler 2006, p. 339"&gt;{{harvnb|Sharer|Traxler|2006|p=339}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Copán was occupied for more than two thousand years, from the [[Mesoamerican chronology|Early Preclassic]] period to the [[Mesoamerican chronology|Postclassic]]. The city developed a distinctive sculptural style within the tradition of the lowland Maya, perhaps to emphasize the Maya ethnicity of the city's rulers.&lt;ref name="Sharer &amp; Traxler 2006, p. 339"/&gt;

The city has a historical record that spans the greater part of the Classic period and has been reconstructed in detail by archaeologists and epigraphers.&lt;ref name="Sharer &amp; Traxler 2006, p. 339"/&gt; Copán was a powerful city ruling a vast kingdom within the [[southern Maya area]].{{sfn|Sharer|Traxler|2006|pp=339, 476}} The city suffered a major political disaster in AD&amp;nbsp;738 when [[Uaxaclajuun Ub'aah K'awiil]], one of the greatest kings in Copán's dynastic history, was captured and executed by his former vassal, the king of [[Quiriguá]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Martin|Grube2000|pp=203–205}}; {{harvnb|Looper|2003|p=76}}; {{harvnb|Miller|1999|pp=134–135}}.&lt;/ref&gt; This unexpected defeat resulted in a 17-year hiatus at the city, during which time Copán may have been subject to Quiriguá in a reversal of fortunes.&lt;ref name="Martin &amp; Grube 2000, pp. 206–207"&gt;{{harvnb|Martin|Grube2000|pp=206–207}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

A significant portion of the eastern side of the acropolis has been eroded away by the [[Copán River]], although the river has since been diverted in order to protect the site from further damage.&lt;ref name="Sharer &amp; Traxler 2006, p. 339"/&gt;

{{anchor|Etymology|Name}}

==Names==
It is thought likely that the ancient name of Copán was '''Oxwitik''' ({{IPA-myn|oʃwitik|pron}}), meaning the "Three Witiks", although the meaning of the word ''witik'' itself remains obscure.{{sfn|Stuart|1996}}{{sfn|Stuart|Houston|1994|pp=23, 25}}

==Location==
[[File:Larger Southern Maya area v3.svg|thumb|left|250px|Location of Copán]]
Copán is located in western Honduras close to the border with Guatemala. Copán lies within the [[Municipalities of Honduras|municipality]] of [[Copán Ruinas]] in the [[Departments of Honduras|department]] of [[Copán Department|Copán]]. It is situated in a fertile valley among foothills at {{convert|700|m|ft|sp=us}} [[above mean sea level]].&lt;ref name="Sharer &amp; Traxler 2006, p. 339"/&gt; The ruins of the site core of the city are located {{convert|1.6|km|mi|0|sp=us}} from the modern village of [[Copán Ruinas]], which is built on the site of a major complex dating to the Classic period.&lt;ref name="Martin &amp; Grube 2000, p. 198"&gt;{{harvnb|Martin|Grube|2000|p=198}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the Preclassic period the floor of the Copán Valley was undulating, swampy and prone to seasonal flooding. In the Early Classic, the inhabitants flattened the valley floor and undertook construction projects to protect the architecture of the city from the effects of flooding.{{sfn|Viel|Hall|2002|p=877}}

Copán had a major influence on regional centres across western and central Honduras, stimulating the introduction of Mesoamerican characteristics to local elites.{{sfn|Sheets|2000|p=434}}

==Population==
[[File:Century Mag Stela I and altar.png|thumb|right|Artistic conception of mayas at the Stela I and altar. Painting of 1898 by [[Henry Sandham]].]]
At the peak of its power in the Late Classic, the kingdom of Copán had a population of at least 20,000 and covered an area of over {{convert|250|km2|sqmi|-1|sp=us}}.{{sfn|Fasquelle|Fash|2005|p=4}} The greater Copán area consisting of the populated areas of the valley covered about a quarter of the size of the city of Tikal. It is estimated that the peak population in central Copán was between 6000 and 9000 in an area of {{convert|0.6|km2|sqmi|sp=us}}, with a further 9,000 to 12,000 inhabitants occupying the periphery—an area of {{convert|23.4|km2|sqmi|sp=us}}. Additionally, there was an estimated rural population of 3,000 to 4,000 in a {{convert|476|km2|sqmi|adj=on|sp=us}} area of the Copán Valley, giving an estimated total population of 18,000 to 25,000 people in the valley during the Late Classic period.{{sfn|Sharer|Traxler|2006|p=688}}

Little is known of the rulers of Copán before the founding of a new dynasty with its origins at [[Tikal]] in the early 5th&amp;nbsp;century AD, although the city's origins can be traced back to the Preclassic period.&lt;ref name="Sharer &amp; Traxler 2006, p. 333; Martin &amp; Grube 2000, p. 193"&gt;{{harvnb|Sharer|Traxler|2006|p=333}}; {{harvnb|Martin|Grube|2000|p=193}}.&lt;/ref&gt; After this, Copán became one of the more powerful Maya city states and was a regional power in the southern Maya region.&lt;ref name="Sharer &amp; Traxler 2006, p. 339"/&gt;  However, it suffered a catastrophic defeat at the hands of its former vassal state [[Quirigua]] in 738, when the long-ruling king [[Uaxaclajuun Ub'aah K'awiil]] was captured and beheaded by Quirigua's ruler [[K'ak' Tiliw Chan Yopaat]] (Cauac Sky).{{sfn|Sharer|Traxler|2006|p=482}} Although this was a major setback, Copán's rulers began to build monumental structures again within a few decades.&lt;ref name="Martin &amp; Grube 2000, pp. 206–207"/&gt;

The area of Copán continued to be occupied after the last major ceremonial structures and royal monuments were erected, but the population declined in the 8th and 9th&amp;nbsp;centuries from perhaps over 20,000 in the city to less than 5,000.  This decrease in population took over four centuries to actually show signs of collapse, showing the stability of this site even after the fall of the ruling dynasties and royal families.{{sfn|Snow|2010|p=267}} The ceremonial center was long abandoned and the surrounding valley home to only a few farming hamlets at the time of the arrival of the [[Spain|Spanish]] in the 16th&amp;nbsp;century.

===Predynastic history===
The fertile Copán River valley was long a site of agriculture before the first known stone architecture was built in the region about the 9th&amp;nbsp;century BC. The city was important before its refounding by a foreign elite; mentions of the predynastic history of Copán are found in later texts, but none of these predates the refounding of the city in AD&amp;nbsp;426.&lt;ref name="Sharer &amp; Traxler 2006, p. 333; Martin &amp; Grube 2000, p. 193"/&gt; There is an inscription that refers to the year 321&amp;nbsp;BC, but no text explains the significance of this date.&lt;ref name="Martin &amp; Grube 2000, p. 193"&gt;{{harvnb|Martin|Grube|2000|p=193}}.&lt;/ref&gt; An event at Copán is linked to another event that happened 208&amp;nbsp;days before in AD&amp;nbsp;159 at an unknown location that is also mentioned on a stela from Tikal, suggesting that it is a location somewhere in the Petén Basin, possibly the great Preclassic Maya city of [[El Mirador]].&lt;ref name="Sharer &amp; Traxler 2006, p. 333"/&gt; This AD&amp;nbsp;159 date is mentioned in several texts and is linked to a figure known as "Foliated [[Ajaw]]". This same person is mentioned on the carved skull of a [[peccary]] recovered from Tomb&amp;nbsp;1, where he is said to perform an action with a stela in AD&amp;nbsp;376.&lt;ref name="Martin &amp; Grube 2000, p. 193"/&gt;

===K'inich Yax K'uk' Mo' and K'inich Popol Hol===
[[File:Yax Kuk Mo.jpg|thumb|left|Ceramic lid shaped to represent K'inich Yax K'uk' Mo', recovered from the tomb of the 7th-century king Smoke Imix, under Temple&amp;nbsp;26.&lt;ref name="Martin &amp; Grube 2000, p. 202"&gt;{{harvnb|Martin|Grube|2000|p=202}}.&lt;/ref&gt;]]
The city was refounded by [[K'inich Yax K'uk' Mo']], establishing it as the capital of a new Maya kingdom.&lt;ref name="Sharer &amp; Traxler 2006, p. 339"/&gt; This coup was apparently organized and launched from Tikal. Texts record the arrival of a warrior named K'uk' Mo' Ajaw who was installed upon the throne of the city in AD&amp;nbsp;426 and given a new royal name, K'inich Yax K'uk' Mo' and the ''ochk'in kaloomte'' "Lord of the West" title used a generation earlier by [[Siyaj K'ak']], a general from the great metropolis of [[Teotihuacan]] who had decisively intervened in the politics of the central Petén.{{sfn|Sharer|Traxler|2006|pp=322, 333–338}} K'inich Yax K'uk' Mo' was probably from Tikal and was likely to have been sponsored by Siyaj Chan K'awill&amp;nbsp;II, the 16th&amp;nbsp;ruler in the dynastic succession of Tikal. K'inich Yax K'uk' Mo' may have legitimized his claim to rulership by marrying into the old Copán royal family, evidenced from the remains of his presumed widow. Bone analysis of her remains indicates that she was local to Copán.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Martin|Grube|2000|p=196}}; {{harvnb|Sharer|Traxler|2006|p=338}}.&lt;/ref&gt; After the establishment of the new kingdom of Copán, the city remained closely allied with Tikal.{{sfn|Sharer|Traxler|2006|p=338}} The hieroglyphic text on [[Copán Altar Q]] describes the lord being elevated to kingship with the receipt of his royal scepter. The ceremonies involved in the founding of the Copán dynasty also included the installation of a subordinate king at [[Quiriguá]].{{sfn|Martin|Grube|2000|p=192}}

A text from Tikal mentions K'uk' Mo' and has been dated to AD&amp;nbsp;406, 20 years before K'uk' Mo' Ajaw founded the new dynasty at Copán. Both names are likely to refer to the same individual originally from Tikal. Although none of the hieroglyphic texts that mention the founding of the new Copán dynasty describe how K'uk' Mo' arrived at the city, indirect evidence suggests that he conquered the city by military means. On Altar&amp;nbsp;Q he is depicted as a Teotihuacano warrior with goggle eyes and a war serpent shield.{{sfn|Sharer|Traxler|2006|pp=338, 341–342}} When he arrived at Copán he initiated the construction of various structures, including one temple in the [[talud-tablero]] style typical of Teotihuacan and another with inset corners and apron moldings that are characteristic of Tikal. These strong links with both the Maya and Central Mexican cultures suggest that he was at least a Mexicanized Maya or possibly even from Teotihuacan.&lt;ref name="Martin &amp; Grube 2000, p. 193"/&gt; The dynasty founded by king K'inich Yax K'uk' Mo' ruled the city for four centuries and included sixteen kings plus a probable pretender who would have been seventeenth in line. Several monuments have survived that were dedicated by K'inich Yax K'uk' Mo' and by his heir.&lt;ref name="Sharer &amp; Traxler 2006, p. 342"&gt;{{harvnb|Sharer|Traxler|2006|p=342}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

K'inich Yax K'uk' Mo' died between AD&amp;nbsp;435 and AD&amp;nbsp;437. In 1995 a tomb underneath the talud-tablero Hunal temple was discovered by a team of archaeologists led by [[Robert Sharer]] and David Sedat. The tomb contained the skeleton of an elderly man with rich offerings and evidence of battle wounds. The remains have been identified as those of K'inich Yax K'uk' Mo' due to their location underneath a sequence of seven buildings erected in his honor. Bone analysis has identified the remains as being those of someone foreign to Copán.&lt;ref name="Martin &amp; Grube 2000, p. 193"/&gt;

[[File:Copán Stela 63.jpg|thumb|right|Stela 63, probably dating to the reign of K'inich Popol Hol.{{sfn|Sharer|Sedat|2005|pp=174–175}}]]
K'inich Popol Hol inherited the throne of Copán from K'inich ax K'uk' Mo', who was his father. He undertook major construction projects with the redesign of the core of Copán. Popol Hol is not the original name of this king but rather a nickname based on the appearance of his Teotihuacan-linked name glyph.&lt;ref name="Martin &amp; Grube 2000, p. 194"&gt;{{harvnb|Martin|Grube|2000|p=194}}.&lt;/ref&gt; K'inich Popol Hol oversaw the construction of the first version of the [[Mesoamerican ballcourt]] at the city, which was decorated with images of the [[scarlet macaw]], a bird that features prominently in [[Maya mythology]]. His greatest construction activity was in the area of his father's palace, now underlying Structure 10L-16, which he demolished after entombing his father there. He then built three successive buildings on top of the tomb in rapid succession.{{sfn|Martin|Grube|2000|p=195}}

===Other early dynastic rulers===
Very little is known about Rulers 3 to 6 in the dynastic succession, although it is known from a fragment of a broken monument reused as construction fill in a later building that one of them was a son of Popol Hol. Ruler&amp;nbsp;3 is depicted on the 8th-century Altar&amp;nbsp;Q, but his name glyph has broken away. Ku&amp;nbsp;Ix was the 4th&amp;nbsp;ruler in the succession. He rebuilt temple 10L-26 in the Acropolis, erecting a stela there and a hieroglyphic step at its base. Although this king is also mentioned on a few other fragments of sculpture, no dates accompany his name. The next two kings in the dynastic sequence are only known from their sculptures on Altar&amp;nbsp;Q.&lt;ref name="Martin &amp; Grube 2000, p. 196"&gt;{{harvnb|Martin|Grube|2000|p=196}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

B'alam Nehn (often referred to as Waterlily Jaguar) was the first king to actually record his position in the dynastic succession, declaring that he was seventh in line from K'inich Yax K'uk' Mo'. Stela&amp;nbsp;15 records that he was already ruling Copán by AD&amp;nbsp;504. B'alam Nehn is the only king of Copán to be mentioned in a hieroglyphic text from outside of the southeastern Maya region. His name appears in a text on Stela&amp;nbsp;16 from [[Caracol]], a site in [[Belize]]. The stela dates to AD&amp;nbsp;534, but the text is not well understood. B'alam Nehn undertook major construction projects in the Acropolis, building over an early palace with a number of important structures.&lt;ref name="Martin &amp; Grube 2000, p. 197"&gt;{{harvnb|Martin|Grube|2000| p=197}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Wil Ohl K'inich, the eighth ruler, is another king known only by his appearance on Altar&amp;nbsp;Q.&lt;ref name="Martin &amp; Grube 2000, p. 197"/&gt; He was succeeded by Ruler&amp;nbsp;9 in AD&amp;nbsp;551, his accession being described on the Hieroglyphic Stairway. He is also depicted on Altar&amp;nbsp;Q even though he ruled for less than two years.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Martin|Grube|2000|pp=197–198}}; {{harvnb|Sharer|Traxler|2006|p=336}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Maya civilization}}
The 10th ruler is nicknamed Moon Jaguar by Mayanists. He was a son of B'alam Nehn, the 7th&amp;nbsp;ruler. He was enthroned in May&amp;nbsp;553. His surviving monuments were found in the modern village of Copán Ruinas, which was a major complex during the Classic period. The most famous construction dating to his reign is the elaborate Rosalila phase of Temple&amp;nbsp;16, discovered entombed intact under later phases of the temple during archaeological tunneling work.&lt;ref name="Martin &amp; Grube 2000, pp. 198–199"&gt;{{harvnb|Martin|Grube|2000|pp=198–199}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===K'ak' Chan Yopaat and Smoke Imix===
K'ak' Chan Yopaat was the eleventh dynastic ruler at Copán. He was crowned as king in AD&amp;nbsp;578, 24&amp;nbsp;days after the death of Moon Jaguar. At the time of his rule, Copán was undergoing an unprecedented rise in population, with residential land use spreading to all available land in the entire Copán Valley. The two surviving stelae of K'ak' Chan Yopaat contain long, hard-to-decipher hieroglyphic texts and are the oldest monuments at the site to survive without being either broken or buried. He reigned for 49&amp;nbsp;years until his death on 5&amp;nbsp;February 628. His name is recorded on four stelae erected by his successors, one of which describes a rite performed with relics from his tomb in AD&amp;nbsp;730, almost a hundred years after his death.{{sfn|Martin|Grube|2000|pp=200–201}}

Smoke Imix was crowned 16 days after the death of K'ak' Chan Yopaat. He is thought to have been the longest reigning king of Copán, ruling from 628 to 695. He is believed to have been born in AD&amp;nbsp;612 and to have become king at the age of 15. Archaeologists have recovered little evidence of activity for the first 26&amp;nbsp;years of his reign, but in AD&amp;nbsp;652 there was a sudden explosion of monument production, with two stelae being erected in the Great Plaza and a further four in important locations across the Copán Valley. These monuments all celebrated a [[k'atun]]-ending. He also erected a stela at the [[Santa Rita, Copán|Santa Rita]] site {{convert|12|km|mi|sp=us}} away and is mentioned on Altar&amp;nbsp;L at Quiriguá in relation to the same event in 652. It is thought that he was trying to stamp his authority throughout the whole valley after the end of some earlier restriction to his freedom to rule as he wished.&lt;ref name="Martin &amp; Grube 2000, p. 201"&gt;{{harvnb|Martin|Grube|2000|p=201}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

After this sudden spate of activity, Smoke Imix continued to rule until almost the end of the 7th&amp;nbsp;century; he dedicated another nine known monuments and made important changes to the architecture of Copán, including the construction of Structure&amp;nbsp;2, which closes the northern side of the Great Plaza, and a new version of Temple&amp;nbsp;26, nicknamed Chorcha. Smoke Imix ruled Copán for 67&amp;nbsp;years and died on 15&amp;nbsp;June 695 at the age of 79, an age that was so distinguished that it is used to identify him in place of his name on Altar&amp;nbsp;Q. His tomb had already been prepared in the Chorcha phase of Temple&amp;nbsp;26 and he was buried just two days after his death.{{sfn|Martin|Grube|2000|pp=202–203}}

===Uaxaclajuun Ub'aah K'awiil===
[[File:Copan (3831024263).jpg|thumb|left|Stela H, depicting king Uaxaclajuun Ub'aah K'awiil]]
[[Uaxaclajuun Ub'aah K'awiil]] was crowned as the 13th&amp;nbsp;king in the Copán dynasty in July&amp;nbsp;695. He oversaw both the apogee of Copán's achievements and also one of the city's most catastrophic political disasters. During his reign, the sculptural style of the city evolved into the full in-the-round sculpture characteristic of Copán. In AD&amp;nbsp;718, Copán attacked and defeated the unidentified site of Xkuy, recording its burning on an unusual stone cylinder. In AD&amp;nbsp;724 Uaxaclajuun Ub'aah K'awiil installed [[K'ak' Tiliw Chan Yopaat]] as a [[vassal]] on the throne of [[Quiriguá]]. Uaxaclajuun Ub'aah K'awiil was confident enough in his power to rank his city among the four most powerful states in the Maya region, together with Tikal, [[Calakmul]] and [[Palenque]], as recorded on Stela&amp;nbsp;A. In contrast to his predecessor, Uaxaclajuun Ub'aah K'awiil concentrated his monuments in the site core of the Copán; his first was Stela&amp;nbsp;J, dated to AD&amp;nbsp;702 and erected at the eastern entrance to the city.&lt;ref name="Martin &amp; Grube 2000, p. 203"/&gt;

He continued to erect a further seven high-quality stelae until AD&amp;nbsp;736, monuments that are considered masterpieces of Classic Maya sculpture with such mastery of detail that they represent the highest pinnacle of Maya artistic achievement.{{sfn|Martin|Grube|2000|pp=203–204}} The stelae depict king Uaxaclajuun Ub'aah K'awiil ritually posed and bearing the attributes of a variety of deities, including B'olon K'awiil, K'uy Nik Ajaw and Mo' Witz Ajaw.&lt;ref name="Martin &amp; Grube 2000, p. 203"/&gt; The king also carried out major construction works, including a new version of Temple&amp;nbsp;26 that now bore the first version of the Hieroglyphic Stairway, plus two temples that have now been lost to the erosion of the Copán River. He also encased the Rosalila phase of Temple&amp;nbsp;16 within a new phase of construction. He remodelled the ballcourt, then demolished it and built a new one in its place.&lt;ref name="Martin &amp; Grube 2000, pp. 204–205"&gt;{{harvnb|Martin|Grube|2000|pp=204–205}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Uaxaclajuun Ub'aah K'awiil had only recently dedicated the new ballcourt in AD&amp;nbsp;738 when a completely unexpected disaster befell the city. Twelve years earlier he had installed K'ak' Tiliw Chan Yopaat on the throne of Quiriguá as his vassal.{{sfn|Martin|Grube|2000|pp=203, 205}} By 734 the king of Quiriguá had shown he was no longer an obedient subordinate when he began to refer to himself as ''k'ul [[ajaw]]'', "holy lord", rather than simply as a subordinate lord ''ajaw''.{{sfn|Drew|1999| p=241}} K'ak' Tiliw Chan Yopaat appears to have taken advantage of wider political rivalries and allied himself with [[Calakmul]], the sworn enemy of Tikal. Copán was firmly allied with Tikal and Calakmul used its alliance with Quiriguá to undermine Tikal's key ally in the south.{{sfn|Looper|2003|p=79}}

Although the exact details are unknown, in April&amp;nbsp;738 K'ak' Tiliw Chan Yopaat captured Uaxaclajuun Ub'aah K'awiil and burned two of Copán's patron deities. Six days later Uaxaclajuun Ub'aah K'awiil was decapitated in Quiriguá.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Martin|Grube|2000|p=204}}; {{harvnb|Looper|2003|p=76}}; {{harvnb|Miller|1999|pp=134–135}}.&lt;/ref&gt; This coup does not seem to have physically affected either Copán or Quiriguá; there is no evidence that either city was attacked at this time and the victor seems not to have received any detectable tribute.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Drew|1999|p=286}}; {{harvnb|Looper|2003|p=78}}.&lt;/ref&gt; All of this seems to imply that K'ak' Tiliw Chan Yopaat managed to somehow ambush Uaxaclajuun Ub'aah K'awiil, rather than to have defeated him in outright battle. It has been suggested that Uaxaclajuun Ub'aah K'awiil was attempting to attack another site to secure captives for [[Sacrifice in Maya culture|sacrifice]] in order to dedicate the new ballcourt when he was ambushed by K'ak' Tiliw Chan Yopaat and his Quiriguá warriors.{{sfn|Looper|2003|p=78}}

In the Late Classic, alliance with Calakmul was frequently associated with the promise of military support. The fact that Copán, a much more powerful city than Quiriguá, failed to retaliate against its former vassal implies that it feared the military intervention of Calakmul. Calakmul was far enough away from Quiriguá that K'ak' Tiliw Chan Yopaat was not afraid of falling directly under its power as a full vassal state, even though it is likely that Calakmul sent warriors to help in the defeat of Copán. The alliance instead seems to have been one of mutual advantage: Calakmul managed to weaken a powerful ally of Tikal while Quiriguá gained its independence.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Looper|1999|p=271}}; {{harvnb|Looper|2003|p=81}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The disaster for Copán had long-lasting consequences; major construction ceased and no new monuments were raised for the next 17&amp;nbsp;years.{{sfn|Martin|Grube|2000|p=206}}

===Later rulers===
K'ak' Joplaj Chan K'awiil was installed as the 14th dynastic ruler of Copán on 7&amp;nbsp;June 738, 39&amp;nbsp;days after the execution of Uaxaclajuun Ub'aah K'awiil. Little is known of his reign due to the lack of monuments raised after Quiriguá's surprise victory. Copán's defeat had wider implications due to the fracturing of the city's domain and the loss of the key [[Motagua River]] [[Trade in Maya civilization|trade route]] to Quiriguá. The fall in Copán's income and corresponding increase at Quiriguá is evident from the massive commissioning of new monuments and architecture at the latter city, and Copán may even have been subject to its former vassal. K'ak' Joplaj Chan K'awiil died in January&amp;nbsp;749.&lt;ref name="Martin &amp; Grube 2000, pp. 206–207"/&gt;

[[File:Copán Stela N.jpg|thumb|left|Stela N, depicting K'ak' Yipyaj Chan K'awiil&lt;ref name="Martin &amp; Grube 2000, p. 208"&gt;{{harvnb|Martin|Grube|2000|p=208}}.&lt;/ref&gt;]]
The next ruler was K'ak' Yipyaj Chan K'awiil, a son of K'ak' Joplaj Chan K'awiil. The early period of his rulership fell within Copán's hiatus, but later on he began a programme of renewal in an effort to recover from the city's earlier disaster. He built a new version of Temple&amp;nbsp;26, with the Hieroglyphic Stairway being reinstalled on the new stairway and doubled in length. Five life-size statues of seated rulers were installed seated upon the stairway. K'ak' Yipyaj Chan K'awiil died in the early 760s and is likely to have been interred in Temple&amp;nbsp;11, although the tomb has not yet been excavated.&lt;ref name="Martin &amp; Grube 2000, pp. 207–208"&gt;{{harvnb|Martin|Grube|2000|pp=207–208}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Yax Pasaj Chan Yopaat was the next ruler, 16th in the dynasty founded by K'inich Yax K'uk' Mo', although he appears not to have been a direct descendent of his predecessor. He took the throne in June&amp;nbsp;763 and may have been only 9&amp;nbsp;years old.&lt;ref name="Martin &amp; Grube 2000, p. 209"/&gt; He produced no monumental stelae and instead dedicated hieroglyphic texts incorporated into the city's architecture and smaller altars. Texts make an obscure reference to his father but his mother was a noblewoman from distant [[Palenque]] in Mexico. He built the platform of Temple&amp;nbsp;11 over the tomb of the previous king in AD&amp;nbsp;769 and added a two-storey superstructure that was finished in AD&amp;nbsp;773.&lt;ref name="Martin &amp; Grube 2000, p. 209"/&gt; Around AD&amp;nbsp;776, he completed the final version of Temple&amp;nbsp;16 over the tomb of the founder. At the base of the temple, he placed the famous Altar&amp;nbsp;Q, which shows each of the 16&amp;nbsp;rulers of the city from K'inich Yax K'uk' Mo' through to Yax Pasaj Chan Yopaat, with a hieroglyphic text on top describing the founding of the dynasty.&lt;ref name="Martin &amp; Grube 2000, p. 210"&gt;{{harvnb|Martin|Grube|2000|p=210}}.&lt;/ref&gt; By the latter 8th&amp;nbsp;century, the nobility had become more powerful, raising palaces with hieroglyphic benches that were as richly constructed as those of the king. At the same time, local satellites were displaying their own local power, as demonstrated by the ruler of Los Higos erecting his own stela in AD&amp;nbsp;781.&lt;ref name="Martin &amp; Grube 2000, p. 210"/&gt; Towards the end of Yax Pasaj Chan Yopaat's reign, the city of Copán was struggling with overpopulation and a lack of local resources, with a distinct fall in living standards among the populace.&lt;ref name="Martin &amp; Grube 2000, p. 210"/&gt; Yax Pasaj Chan Yopaat was able to celebrate his second K'atun in AD&amp;nbsp;802 with his own monument, but the king's participation in the K'atun ending ceremony of AD&amp;nbsp;810 was marked at Quiriguá, not at Copán.&lt;ref name="Martin &amp; Grube 2000, p. 210"/&gt; By this time the city's population was over 20,000 and it had long needed to import basic necessities from outside.&lt;ref name="Martin &amp; Grube 2000, p. 211"&gt;{{harvnb|Martin|Grube|2000|p=211}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

The troubled times enveloping Copán at this time are evident from the funerary tomb of Yax Pasaj Chan Yopaat, which bears sculptures of the king performing war dances with spear and shield in hand. The sculpted column from the temple shrine has a hieroglyphic text reading "toppling of the Foundation House" that may refer to the fall of the Copán dynasty.&lt;ref name="Martin &amp; Grube 2000, p. 212"&gt;{{harvnb|Martin|Grube|2000|p=212}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Shortage and disease afflicted the massively overpopulated valley of Copán when its last known king, Ukit&amp;nbsp;Took', came to the throne on 6&amp;nbsp;February 822. He commissioned Altar&amp;nbsp;L in the style of Altar&amp;nbsp;Q but the monument was never finished — one face shows the enthronement of the king and a second face was started but two others were completely blank. The long line of kings at the once great city had come to an end. Before the end, even the nobility had been struck by disease, perhaps because epidemics among the malnourished masses spread to the elite. With the end of political authority at the city the population collapsed to a fraction of what it had been at its height.&lt;ref name="Martin &amp; Grube 2000, p. 212"/&gt; This collapse of the city-state, which people believe occurred sometime between 800 and 830 AD, was sudden. However, the population continued to persist and even flourish between the years 750 and 900 AD, and then gradually declined soon thereafter.{{sfn|Snow|2010|p=168}}  In the Postclassic period the valley was occupied by villagers who stole the stone from the monumental architecture of the city in order to build their simple house platforms.&lt;ref name="Martin &amp; Grube 2000, p. 212"/&gt;

The first post-Spanish conquest mention of Copán was in an early colonial period letter dated 8 March 1576. The letter was written by Diego García de Palacio, a member of the [[Royal Audiencia of Guatemala|Royal Audience of Guatemala]], to king [[Philip II of Spain]].{{sfn|Kelly|1996|p=277}} French explorer [[Jean-Frédéric Waldeck]] visited the site in the early 19th century and spent a month there drawing the ruins.{{sfn|Kelly|1996|p=278}} Colonel [[Juan Galindo]] led an expedition to the ruins in 1834 on behalf of the government of Guatemala and wrote articles about the site for English, French and North American publications.{{sfn|Kelly|1996|p=278}} [[John Lloyd Stephens]] and [[Frederick Catherwood]] visited Copán and included a description, map and detailed drawings in Stephens' ''Incidents of Travel in Central America, Chiapas and Yucatán'', published in 1841.{{sfn|Kelly|1996|p=278}} The site was later visited by British archaeologist [[Alfred Maudslay]].{{sfn|Kelly|1996|p=278}} Several expeditions sponsored by the [[Peabody Museum of Harvard University]] worked at Copán during the late 19th and early 20th centuries,{{sfn|Kelly|1996|pp=278-279}} including the 1892&amp;ndash;1893 excavation of the Hieroglyphic Stairway by [[John G.

The Copán buildings suffered significantly from forces of nature in the centuries between the site's abandonment and the rediscovery of the ruins. After the abandonment of the city the [[Copán River]] gradually changed course, with a [[meander]] destroying the eastern portion of the acropolis (revealing in the process its [[stratification (archaeology)|archaeological stratigraphy]] in a large vertical [[cut (archaeology)|cut]]) and apparently washing away various subsidiary architectural groups, including at least one courtyard and 10 buildings from Group 10L&amp;ndash;2.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Sharer|Traxler|2006|pp=335, 339}}; Fash et al 2005, p.268.&lt;/ref&gt; The cut is an important archaeological feature at the site, with the natural erosion having created an enormous cross-section of the acropolis. This erosion cut away a large portion of the eastern part of the acropolis and revealed a vertical cross-section that measures {{convert|37|m|ft|sp=us}} high at its tallest point and {{convert|300|m|ft|sp=us}} long.&lt;ref name="Sharer &amp; Traxler 2006, p. 339"/&gt; Several buildings recorded in the 19th&amp;nbsp;century were destroyed, plus an unknown amount of the acropolis that was eroded before it could be recorded.&lt;ref name="Sharer &amp; Traxler 2006, p. 339"/&gt; In order to avoid further destruction of the acropolis, the [[Carnegie Institution for Science|Carnegie Institution]] redirected the river to save the archaeological site, diverting it southwards in the 1930s; the dry former riverbed was finally filled in at the same time as consolidation of the cut in 1990s.{{sfn|Sharer|Traxler|2006|pp=68, 335, 339}} '''Structures 10L&amp;ndash;19, 20, 20A''' and '''21''' were all destroyed by the Copán River as it eroded the site away, but had been recorded by investigators in the 19th&amp;nbsp;century.&lt;ref name="Sharer &amp; Traxler 2006, p. 339"/&gt;

==Site description==
[[File:CPN SITE PLAN 01 en.jpg|thumb|right|Map of the center of Copán]]
The Copán site is known for a series of portrait [[Maya stelae|stelae]], most of which were placed along processional ways in the central plaza of the city and the adjoining [[acropolis]], a large complex of overlapping step-pyramids, plazas, and palaces. The site has a large court for playing the [[Mesoamerican ballgame]].&lt;ref name="Martin &amp; Grube 2000, p. 205"&gt;{{harvnb|Martin|Grube|2000|p=205}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

The site is divided into various groups, with the Main Group and the Cemetery Group in the site core linked by a [[sacbe]] to the Sepulturas Group to the northeast.&lt;ref name="Sharer &amp; Traxler 2006, p. 340"&gt;{{harvnb|Sharer|Traxler|2006|p=340}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Central Copán had a density of 1449 structures per square kilometer ({{convert|1449|/sqkm|/sqmi|disp=output only}}), while in greater Copán as a whole this density fell to {{convert|143|/sqkm|/sqmi}} over a surveyed area of {{convert|24.6|km2|sqmi|sp=us}}.{{sfn|Sharer|Traxler|2006|p=686}}

===Main Group===
[[File:IMG 2314.JPG|thumb|right|Stela M and the Hieroglyphic Stairway&lt;ref name="Sharer &amp; Traxler 2006, p. 342"/&gt;]]
The Main Group represents the core of the ancient city and covers an area of {{convert|600|x|300|m|ft|sp=us}}. The main features are the Acropolis, which is a raised royal complex on the south side, and a group of smaller structures and linked plazas to the north, including the Hieroglyphic Stairway and the [[Mesoamerican ballcourt|ballcourt]]. The Monument Plaza contains the greatest concentration of sculpted monuments at the site.{{sfn|Sharer|Traxler|2006|pp=339–340}}

The '''Acropolis''' was the royal complex at the heart of Copán. It consists of two plazas that have been named the West Court and the East Court. They are both enclosed by elevated structures.&lt;ref name="Sharer &amp; Traxler 2006, p. 340"/&gt; Archaeologists have excavated extensive tunnels under the Acropolis, revealing how the royal complex at the heart of Copán developed over the centuries and uncovering several hieroglyphic texts that date back to the Early Classic and verify details of the early dynastic rulers of the city who were recorded on Altar&amp;nbsp;Q hundreds of years later. The deepest of these tunnels have revealed that the first monumental structures underlying the Acropolis date archaeologically to the early 5th&amp;nbsp;century AD, when K'inich Yax K'uk' Mo' established the royal dynasty.{{sfn|Sharer|Traxler|2006|p=342}} These early buildings were built of stone and [[adobe]] and were themselves built upon earlier earth and cobble structures dating to the predynastic period.{{sfn|Sharer|Traxler|2006|pp=342, 344}} The two styles of building overlap somewhat, with some of the earthen structures being expanded during the first hundred years or so of the dynastic history of the city.&lt;ref name="Sharer &amp; Traxler 2006, p. 344"&gt;{{harvnb|Sharer|Traxler|2006|p=344}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The early dynastic masonry buildings of the Acropolis included several with the Early Classic apron-molding style of Tikal and one built in the ''[[talud-tablero]]'' style associated with Teotihuacan, although at the time the ''talud-tablero'' form was in use at both Tikal and [[Kaminaljuyu]] as well as in Central Mexico.&lt;ref name="Sharer &amp; Traxler 2006, p. 344"/&gt;

'''Structure 10L-4''' is a platform with four stairways situated by the Monument Plaza.&lt;ref name="Sharer &amp; Traxler 2006, p. 340"/&gt;

[[File:Honduras-0153 (2213588425).jpg|thumb|left|upright|A stone head at the bottom of Structure 10L-11]]
'''Structure 10L-11''' is on the west side of the Acropolis. It encloses the south side of the Court of the Hieroglyphic Stairway and is accessed from it by a wide monumental stairway. This structure appears to have been the royal palace of Yax Pasaj Chan Yopaat, the 16th&amp;nbsp;ruler in the dynastic succession and the last known king of Copán. Structure 10L-11 was built on top of several earlier structures, one of which probably contains the tomb of his predecessor K'ak' Yipyaj Chan K'awiil. A small tunnel descends into the interior of the structure, possibly to the tomb, but it has not yet been excavated by archaeologists.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Sharer|Traxler|2006|pp=334, 340}}; {{harvnb|Martin|Grube|2000|p=208}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Yax Pasaj Chan Yopaat built a new temple platform over his predecessor's tomb in AD&amp;nbsp;769. On top of this he placed a two-storey superstructure with a sculpted roof depicting the mythological cosmos. At each of its northern corners was a large sculpted [[Pawatun]] (a group of deities that supported the heavens). This superstructure had four doorways with panels of hieroglyphs sculpted directly onto the walls of the building. A [[Copán Bench Panel|bench]] inside the structure, removed by Maudslay in the nineteenth century and now in the [[British Museum]]'s collection, once depicted the king's accession to the throne, overseen by deities and ancestors.&lt;ref name="Martin &amp; Grube 2000, p. 209"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.britishmuseum.org/research/collection_online/collection_object_details.aspx?objectId=3428767&amp;partId=1&amp;place=9697&amp;plaA=9697-3-1&amp;page=1 British Museum Collection]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Copan (125) sm (4289308339).jpg|thumb|The West Court of Copán]]
'''Structure 10L-16''' (Temple 16) is a temple pyramid that is the highest part of the Acropolis. It is located between the East and West Courts at the heart of the ancient city.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Sharer|Traxler|2006|pp=334, 340}}; {{harvnb|Fasquelle|Fash|2005|p=201}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The temple faces the West Court within the Acropolis and is dedicated to K'inich Yax K'uk' Mo', the dynastic founder. The temple was placed on top of the original palace and tomb of the king. It is the final version of a number of temples built on top of each other, as was common practice in Mesoamerica.&lt;ref name="Sharer &amp; Traxler 2006, pp. 334, 340"&gt;{{harvnb|Sharer|Traxler|2006|pp=334, 340}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The earliest version of this temple is nicknamed Hunal; it was built in the talud-tablero style of architecture that was typical of Teotihuacan, with traces of brightly colored murals on the surviving traces of the interior walls. The king was buried in a vaulted crypt that was cut into the floor of the Hunal phase of the building, accompanied by rich offerings of [[Jade use in Mesoamerica|jade]]. K'inich Popol Hol, son of the founder, demolished the palace of his father and built a platform on top of his tomb, named Yehnal by archaeologists. It was built in a distinctively Petén Maya style and bore large masks of K'inich Tajal Wayib', the sun god, which were painted red. This platform was encased within another much larger platform within a decade of its construction. This larger platform has been named Margarita and had stucco panels flanking its access stairway that bore entwined images of [[Resplendent quetzal|quetzals]] and macaws, which both form a part of K'inich Yax K'uk' Mo's name. The Margarita phase contained a [[Margarita Tomb|tomb]] with the richly accompanied burial of an elderly woman nicknamed the "Lady in Red". It is likely that she was the widow of K'inich Yax K'uk' Mo' and the mother of K'inich Popol Hol. The upper chamber of the Margarita phase temple was converted to receive offerings and the unusual Xukpi stone, a dedicatory monument used in one of the earlier phases, was reused in this later phase.{{sfn|Martin|Grube|2000|pp=193–196}}

[[File:CPN Rosalila 01.jpg|thumb|left|Life-size reconstruction of the Rosalila temple at the site museum of Copán.{{sfn|Martin|Grube|2000|p=199}}]]
One of the best preserved phases of Temple 16 is the Rosalila, built over the remains of five previous versions of the temple. Archaeologist Ricardo Agurcia discovered the almost intact shrine while tunneling underneath the final version of the temple. Rosalila is notable for its excellent state of preservation, including the entire building from the base platform up to the [[roof comb]], including its highly elaborate painted stucco decoration. Rosalila features K'inich Yax K'uk' Mo' placed at the centre of a mythological tableau, combining the founder of the dynasty with the [[List of Maya gods and supernatural beings|sky deity]] [[Itzamna]] in avian form. The mythological imagery also includes [[Anthropomorphism|anthropomorphic]] mountains, skeletons and crocodiles. Vents in the exterior were designed so smoke from incense being burned inside the shrine would interact with the stucco sculpture of the exterior. The temple had a hieroglyphic stone step with a dedicatory inscription. The stone step is less well preserved than the rest of the building, but a date in AD&amp;nbsp;571 has been deciphered. Due to the deforestation of the Copán valley, the Rosalila building was the last structure at the site to use such elaborate stucco decoration — vast quantities of firewood could no longer be spared to reduce limestone to plaster. A life-size copy of the Rosalila building has been built at the Copán site museum.&lt;ref name="Martin &amp; Grube 2000, pp. 198–199"/&gt;

Uaxaclajuun Ub'aah K'awiil encased the Rosalila phase under a new version of the building in the early 8th&amp;nbsp;century AD. An offering was made as part of the rites to terminate the old phase and included a collection of [[Eccentric flint (archaeology)|eccentric flint]]s worked into the profiles of humans and gods, which were wrapped in blue-dyed textiles.&lt;ref name="Martin &amp; Grube 2000, p. 204"&gt;{{harvnb|Martin|Grube|2000|p=204}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Structure 10L-18''' is on the southeastern side of the Acropolis and has been damaged by the erosion caused by the Copán River, having lost its eastern side. Stairs on the south side of the structure lead down to a vaulted tomb that was looted in ancient times and was probably that of Yax Pasaj Chan Yopaat. It was apparently plundered soon after the collapse of the Copán kingdom.&lt;ref name="Sharer &amp; Traxler 2006, p. 340"/&gt; Unusually for Copán, the summit shrine had four sculpted panels depicting the king performing war dances with spear and shield, emphasizing the rising tensions as the dynasty came to its end.&lt;ref name="Martin &amp; Grube 2000, p. 212"/&gt;

[[File:CPN STR 22 01.jpg|thumb|right|The interior doorway of Structure 10L-22]]
'''Temples 10L-20''' and '''10L-21''' were probably both built by Uaxaclajuun Ub'aah K'awiil. They were lost to the Copán River in the early 20th&amp;nbsp;century.&lt;ref name="Martin &amp; Grube 2000, p. 204"/&gt;

'''Structure 10L-22''' is a large building on the north side of the East Court, in the Acropolis, and faces onto it. It dates to the reign of Uaxaclajuun Ub'aah K'awiil and is the best preserved of the buildings from his rule. The superstructure of the building has an interior doorway with an elaborate sculpted frame and decorated with masks of the mountain god ''Witz''. The outer doorway is framed by the giant mask of a deity, and has stylistic similarities with the [[Chenes]] regional style of distant [[Yucatán (state)|Yucatán]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Sharer|Traxler|2006|p=340}}; {{harvnb|Martin|Grube|2000|p=204}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The temple was built to celebrate the completion of the king's first K'atun in power, in AD&amp;nbsp;715, and has a hieroglyphic step with a first-person phrase "I completed my K'atun". The building symbolically represents the mountain where maize was created.&lt;ref name="Martin &amp; Grube 2000, pp. 204–205"/&gt;

'''Structure 10L-25''' is in the East Court of the Acropolis. It covers a rich royal tomb nicknamed Sub-Jaguar by archaeologists. It is presumed to be the tomb of either Ruler&amp;nbsp;7 (B'alam Nehn), Ruler&amp;nbsp;8 or Ruler&amp;nbsp;9, who all ruled in the first half of the 6th&amp;nbsp;century AD.{{sfn|Martin|Grube|2000|pp=197–198}}

'''Structure 10L-26''' is a temple that projects northwards from the Acropolis and is immediately to the north of Structure 10L-22. The structure was built by Uaxaclajuun Ub'aah K'awiil and K'ak' Yipyaj Chan K'awiil, the 13th and 15th&amp;nbsp;rulers in the dynastic succession. The {{convert|10|m|ft|adj=on|sp=us}} wide Hieroglyphic Stairway ascends the building on the west side from the courtyard below.&lt;ref name="Sharer &amp; Traxler 2006, pp. 334, 340"/&gt; The earliest version of the temple, nicknamed Yax, was built during the reign of K'inich Yax K'uk' Mo', the dynastic founder, and has architectural features (such as inset corners) that are characteristic of Tikal and the central Petén region.&lt;ref name="Martin &amp; Grube 2000, p. 193"/&gt; The next phase of the building was built by Yax K'uk' Mo's son K'inich Popol Hol and is nicknamed Motmot. This phase of the structure was more elaborate and was decorated with stucco. Set under the building was the Motmot capstone, covering a tomb with the unusual Teotihuacan-style burial of a woman, accompanied by a wide variety of offerings that included animal bones, [[mercury (element)|mercury]], jade and [[quartz]], along with three severed human heads, all of which were male.&lt;ref name="Martin &amp; Grube 2000, p. 194"/&gt; Ku Ix built a new phase of the building over Motmot, nicknamed Papagayo.&lt;ref name="Martin &amp; Grube 2000, p. 196"/&gt;

Smoke Imix demolished the Papagayo phase and ritually interred the broken remains of its sculpted monuments, accompanied by stone macaw heads from an early version of the ballcourt. He then built a pyramid over the earlier phases, nicknamed Mascarón by archaeologists. It in turn was developed into the Chorcha pyramid with the addition of a long superstructure with seven doorways at the front and back. Before a new building was built over the top, the upper sanctuary was demolished and a tomb was inserted into the floor and covered with 11 large stone slabs. The tomb contained the remains of an adult male and a sacrificed child. The adult's badly decayed skeleton was wrapped in a mat and accompanied by offerings of fine [[jade]], including ear ornaments and a necklace of sculpted figurines. The burial was accompanied by offerings of 44 ceramic vessels, [[jaguar]] pelts, [[spondylus]] shells, 10 paintpots and one or more hieroglyphic books, now decayed. There were also 12 ceramic incense burners with lids modeled into human figurines, thought to represent Smoke Imix and his 11 dynastic predecessors. The Chorcha building was dedicated to the long-lived 7th-century king Smoke Imix and it is therefore likely that the remains interred in the building are his.&lt;ref name="Martin &amp; Grube 2000, p. 202"/&gt; Uaxaclajuun Ub'aah K'awiil had sealed the Chorcha phase under a new version of the temple, nicknamed Esmeralda, by AD&amp;nbsp;710. The new phase bore the first version of the Hieroglyphic Stairway, which contains a lengthy dynastic history.&lt;ref name="Martin &amp; Grube 2000, p. 204"/&gt; K'ak' Yipyaj Chan K'awiil built over the Esmeralda phase in the mid-8th&amp;nbsp;century. He removed the Hieroglyphic Stairway from the earlier building and reinstalled it into his own version, while doubling the length of its text and adding five life-size statues of rulers dressed in the garb of Teotihuacano warriors, each seated on a step of the stairway. At the base of the stairway, he also raised Stela&amp;nbsp;M, with his own image. The summit shrine of the temple bore a hieroglyphic text composed of full-figure hieroglyphs, each placed beside a similar glyph in faux-Mexican style, giving the appearance of a bilingual text.&lt;ref name="Martin &amp; Grube 2000, pp. 207–208"/&gt;

[[File:Copán Ballcourt.jpg|thumb|right|The final version of the ballcourt was dedicated by Uaxaclajuun Ub'aah K'awiil in AD&amp;nbsp;738.&lt;ref name="Martin &amp; Grube 2000, p. 205"/&gt;]]
The '''Hieroglyphic Stairway''' climbs the west side of Structure 10L-26. It is {{convert|10|m|ft|sp=us}} wide and has a total of 62&amp;nbsp;steps. Stela&amp;nbsp;M and its associated altar are at its base and a large sculpted figure is located in the centre of every 12th&amp;nbsp;step. These figures are believed to represent the most important rulers in the dynastic history of the site. The stairway takes its name from the 2200&amp;nbsp;glyphs that together form the longest known Maya hieroglyphic text. The text is still being reconstructed, having been scrambled by the collapse of the glyphic blocks when the façade of the temple collapsed.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Sharer|Traxler|2006|p=340}}; {{harvnb|Martin|Grube|2000|p=208}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The staircase measures {{convert|21|m|ft|sp=us}} long and was first built by Uaxaclajuun Ub'aah K'awiil in AD&amp;nbsp;710, being reinstalled and expanded in the following phase of the temple by K'ak' Yipyaj Chan K'awiil in AD&amp;nbsp;755.&lt;ref name="Martin &amp; Grube 2000, p. 208"/&gt;

The '''Ballcourt''' is immediately north of the Court of the Hieroglyphic Stairway and is to the south of the Monument Plaza.&lt;ref name="Sharer &amp; Traxler 2006, pp. 334, 340"/&gt; It was remodeled by Uaxaclajuun Ub'aah K'awiil, who then demolished it and built a third version, which was one of the largest from the Classic period. It was dedicated to the great macaw deity and the buildings flanking the playing area carried 16 mosaic sculptures of the birds. The completion date of the ballcourt is inscribed with a hieroglyphic text upon the sloping playing area and is given as 6&amp;nbsp;January 738.&lt;ref name="Martin &amp; Grube 2000, p. 205"/&gt;

The '''Monument Plaza''' or '''Great Plaza''' is on the north side of the Main Group.&lt;ref name="Sharer &amp; Traxler 2006, pp. 334, 340"/&gt;

===Sepulturas Group===
The Sepulturas Group is linked by a ''sacbe'' or causeway that runs southwest to the Monument Plaza in the Main Group. The Sepulturas Group consists of a number of restored structures, mostly elite residences that feature stone benches, some of which have carved decorations, and a number of tombs.&lt;ref name="Sharer &amp; Traxler 2006, p. 340"/&gt;

The group has a very long occupational history, with one house having been dated as far back as the Early Preclassic. By the Middle Preclassic, large platforms were being built from [[Cobblestone architecture|cobbles]] and several rich burials were made. By AD&amp;nbsp;800, the complex consisted of about 50 buildings arranged around 7 major courtyards.&lt;ref name="Martin &amp; Grube 2000, p. 211"/&gt; At this time, the most important building was the ''House of the Bakabs'', the palace of a powerful nobleman from the time of Yax Pasaj Chan Yopaat. The building has a high-quality sculpted exterior and a carved hieroglyphic bench inside. A portion of the group was a subdistrict occupied by non-Maya inhabitants from Central Honduras who were involved in the trade network that brought in goods from that region.&lt;ref name="Martin &amp; Grube 2000, p. 211"/&gt;

The '''North Group''' is a Late Classic compound. Archaeologists have excavated fallen façades that bear hieroglyphic inscriptions and sculpted decoration.&lt;ref name="Sharer &amp; Traxler 2006, p. 340"/&gt;

The '''Cemetery Group''' is immediately south of the Main Group and includes a number of small structures and plazas.&lt;ref name="Sharer &amp; Traxler 2006, p. 340"/&gt;

'''[[Copán Altar Q|Altar Q]]''' is the most famous monument at Copán.{{sfn|Fasquelle|Fash|2005|p=201}} It was dedicated by king Yax Pasaj Chan Yopaat in AD&amp;nbsp;776 and has each of the first 16 kings of the Copán dynasty carved around its side. Each figure is depicted seated on his name glyph. A hieroglyphic text is inscribed on the upper surface, relating the founding of the dynasty in AD&amp;nbsp;426&amp;ndash;427. On one side, it shows the dynastic founder K'inich Yax K'uk' Mo' transferring power to Yax Pasaj.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Martin|Grube|2000|pp=210, 192}}; {{harvnb|Sharer|Traxler|2006|p=341}}.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Tatiana Proskouriakoff]] first discovered the inscription on the West Side of Altar Q that tells us the date of the inauguration of Yax Pasaj. This portrayal of political succession tells us much about Early Classic Maya culture.

The '''Motmot Capstone''' is an inscribed stone that was placed over a tomb under Structure 10L-26. Its face was finely sculpted with portraits of the first two kings of the Copán dynasty, K'inich Yax K'uk' Mo' and K'inich Popol Hol, facing towards each other with a double column of hieroglyphs between them, all contained within a quatrefoil frame. The frame and the hieroglyphic names of mythological locations underneath the feet of the two kings place them in a supernatural realm. The capstone bears two calendrical dates, in AD&amp;nbsp;435 and AD&amp;nbsp;441. The second of these is probably the date that the capstone was dedicated.&lt;ref name="Martin &amp; Grube 2000, p. 194"/&gt;

The '''Xukpi Stone''' is a dedicatory monument from one of the earlier phases of the 10L-16 temple constructed to honor K'inich Yax K'uk' Mo'. It bears the date of AD&amp;nbsp;437 and the names both K'inich Yax K'uk' Mo' and K'inich Popol Hol, together with a possible mention of the Teotihuacan general Siyaj K'ak'. The monument has not been completely deciphered and its style and phrasing are unusual.&lt;ref name="Martin &amp; Grube 2000, p. 196"/&gt; Originally it was used as a sculpted bench or step and the date on the monument is associated with the dedication of a funerary temple or a tomb, probably the tomb of K'inich' Yax K'uk' Mo', which was discovered underneath the same structure.&lt;ref name="Sharer &amp; Traxler 2006, p. 344"/&gt;

'''Stela 2''' was erected in the Great Plaza by Smoke Imix in AD&amp;nbsp;652.&lt;ref name="Martin &amp; Grube 2000, p. 201"/&gt;

'''Stela 3''' is another stela erected  by Smoke Imix in the Great Plaza in AD&amp;nbsp;652.&lt;ref name="Martin &amp; Grube 2000, p. 201"/&gt;

'''Stela 4''' was erected by Uaxaclajuun Ub'aah K'awiil in the early 8th&amp;nbsp;century AD.&lt;ref name="Martin &amp; Grube 2000, p. 203"/&gt;

'''Stela 7''' dates to the reign of K'ak' Chan Yopaat, and was erected to celebrate the [[K'atun]]-ending ceremony of AD&amp;nbsp;613. It was found in the western complex now underneath the modern village of Copán Ruinas. It bears a long hieroglyphic text that has been only partially deciphered.&lt;ref name="Martin &amp; Grube 2000, p. 200"&gt;{{harvnb|Martin|Grube|2000|p=200}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Stela 9''' was found in the modern village of Copán Ruinas, where it had been erected on the site of a major Classic period complex {{convert|1.6|km|mi|0|sp=us}} outside of the site core. It was dedicated by Moon Jaguar and dates to AD&amp;nbsp;564.&lt;ref name="Martin &amp; Grube 2000, p. 198"/&gt;

'''Stela 10''' was erected outside of the site core by Smoke Imix in AD&amp;nbsp;652.&lt;ref name="Martin &amp; Grube 2000, p. 201"/&gt;

'''Stela 11''' was originally an interior column from Temple 18, the funerary shrine of Yax Pasaj Chan Yopaat. When it was found, it was broken in two parts at the base of the temple. It portrays the king as the elderly [[Maya maize god]] and has imagery that seems to deliberately parallel the tomb lid of the Palenque king [[K'inich Janaab' Pakal]], probably because of Yax Pasaj Chan Yopaat's close family ties to that city. The text of the column formed part of a longer text carved onto the interior walls of the temple and may describe the downfall of the Copán dynasty.&lt;ref name="Martin &amp; Grube 2000, p. 212"/&gt;

'''Stela 12''' was erected outside of the site core by Smoke Imix in AD&amp;nbsp;652.&lt;ref name="Martin &amp; Grube 2000, p. 201"/&gt;

'''Stela 13''' was erected outside the site core by Smoke Imix in AD&amp;nbsp;652.&lt;ref name="Martin &amp; Grube 2000, p. 201"/&gt;

'''Stela 15''' is dated to AD&amp;nbsp;524, during the reign of B'alam Nehn. Its sculpture consists entirely of hieroglyphic text, which mentions that king B'alam Nehn was ruling the city by AD&amp;nbsp;504.&lt;ref name="Martin &amp; Grube 2000, p. 197"/&gt;

'''Stela 17''' dates to AD&amp;nbsp;554, during the reign of Moon Jaguar. It originally stood in the nearby village of Copán Ruinas, which was a major complex in the Classic period.&lt;ref name="Martin &amp; Grube 2000, p. 198"/&gt;

'''Stela 18''' is a fragment of a monument bearing the name of K'inich Popol Hol. It was erected in the inner chamber of the 10L-26 temple.{{sfn|Martin|Grube|2000|pp=194–196}}

'''Stela 19''' is a monument erected outside of the site core by Smoke Imix in AD&amp;nbsp;652.&lt;ref name="Martin &amp; Grube 2000, p. 201"/&gt;

'''Stela 63''' was dedicated by K'inich Popol Hol. Its sculpture consists purely of finely carved hieroglyphic texts and it is possible that it was originally commissioned by K'inich Yax K'uk' Mo' with additional texts added to the sides of the monument by his son. The text contains the same date in AD&amp;nbsp;435 that appears on the Motmot Capstone. Stela&amp;nbsp;63 was deliberately broken, together with its hieroglyphic step, during the ritual demolishing of the Papagayo phase of Temple 26. The remains of the monuments were then interred in the building before the next phase was built.{{sfn|Martin|Grube|2000|pp=194, 202}}

'''Stela A''' was erected in 731 by Uaxaclajuun Ub'aah K'awiil. It places his rulership among the four most powerful kingdoms in the Maya region, alongside Palenque, Tikal and Calakmul.&lt;ref name="Martin &amp; Grube 2000, p. 203"/&gt;

'''Stela B''' was erected by Uaxaclajuun Ub'aah K'awiil in the early 8th&amp;nbsp;century AD.&lt;ref name="Martin &amp; Grube 2000, p. 203"/&gt;

'''Stela C''' was erected by Uaxaclajuun Ub'aah K'awiil in the early 8th&amp;nbsp;century AD.&lt;ref name="Martin &amp; Grube 2000, p. 203"/&gt;

'''Stela D''' was erected by Uaxaclajuun Ub'aah K'awiil in the early 8th&amp;nbsp;century AD.&lt;ref name="Martin &amp; Grube 2000, p. 203"/&gt;

'''Stela F''' was erected by Uaxaclajuun Ub'aah K'awiil in the early 8th&amp;nbsp;century AD.&lt;ref name="Martin &amp; Grube 2000, p. 203"/&gt;

'''Stela H''' was erected by Uaxaclajuun Ub'aah K'awiil in the early 8th&amp;nbsp;century AD.&lt;ref name="Martin &amp; Grube 2000, p. 203"/&gt;

'''Stela J''' was erected by Uaxaclajuun Ub'aah K'awiil in AD&amp;nbsp;702 and was his first monument. It stood at the eastern entrance to the city and is unusual in being topped by a sculpted stone roof, converting the monument into a symbolic house. It bears a hieroglyphic text that is woven into a criss-cross mat design to form a convoluted puzzle that must be read in precisely the right order to be understood.&lt;ref name="Martin &amp; Grube 2000, p. 203"/&gt;

'''Stela M''' bears a portrait of K'ak' Yipyaj Chan K'awiil. It was raised at the foot of the Hieroglyphic Stairway of Temple&amp;nbsp;26 in AD&amp;nbsp;756.&lt;ref name="Martin &amp; Grube 2000, p. 203"/&gt;

'''Stela N''' was dedicated by K'ak' Yipyaj Chan K'awiil in AD&amp;nbsp;761 and placed at the foot of the steps to Temple&amp;nbsp;11, which is believed to contain his burial.&lt;ref name="Martin &amp; Grube 2000, p. 208"/&gt;

'''Stela P''' was originally erected in an unknown location and was later moved to the West Court of the Acropolis. It bears a long hieroglyphic text that has not yet been fully deciphered. It dates from the reign of king K'ak' Chan Yopaat and was dedicated in AD&amp;nbsp;623.&lt;ref name="Martin &amp; Grube 2000, p. 200"/&gt;

A '''double-sided painting''' is a [[canvas]] which has a [[painting]] on either side. Historically, [[artist]]s would often paint on both sides out of need of material. The [[wikt:subject-matter|subject matter]] of the two paintings was sometimes, although not normally, related.

Web: http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/egalitarianism&lt;/ref&gt; Egalitarianism is a trend of thought in political philosophy. According to the ''[[Merriam-Webster Dictionary]]'', the term has two distinct definitions in modern English:&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/egalitarianism Egalitarianism – Definition – Merriam-Webster Dictionary]&lt;/ref&gt; either as a political [[doctrine]] that all people should be treated as equals and have the same [[Political freedom|political]], [[Economic freedom|economic]], [[Social justice|social]] and [[Civil and political rights|civil rights]];&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.thefreedictionary.com/egalitarianism |title=egalitarianism |author=The American Heritage Dictionary |year=2003}}&lt;/ref&gt; or as a social philosophy advocating the [[Redistribution of income and wealth|removal of economic inequalities among people]], [[economic egalitarianism]], or the [[Decentralization|decentralization of power]]. Some sources define egalitarianism as the point of view that equality reflects the natural state of humanity.&lt;ref name=gawdy&gt;{{cite book|title=Limited Wants, Unlimited Means: A reader on Hunter-Gatherer Economics and the Environment|author=John Gowdy|year=1998|publisher=Island Press|location=St Louis|isbn=1-55963-555-X|page=342}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Dahlberg"&gt;{{cite book|author=Dahlberg, Frances.|url=https://books.google.com/?id=eTPULzP1MZAC&amp;pg=PA120|title=Woman the Gatherer|location=London|publisher=Yale university press|year=1975|isbn=0-300-02989-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Erdal, D. &amp; Whiten, A.

== Forms ==
Some specifically focused egalitarian concerns include [[communism]], [[Equality before the law|legal egalitarianism]], [[luck egalitarianism]], [[political egalitarianism]], [[Gender equality|gender egalitarianism]], [[racial equality]], [[equality of outcome]] and [[Christian egalitarianism]]. Common forms of egalitarianism include political and philosophical.

=== Legal egalitarianism ===
{{details|equality before the law}}
One argument is that [[liberalism]] provides democratic societies with the means to carry out civic reform by providing a framework for developing public policy and thus providing the right conditions for individuals to achieve civil rights.&lt;ref&gt;Rosales, José María. "Liberalism, Civic Reformism and Democracy." 20th World Contress on Philosophy: Political Philosophy. Web: 12 March 2010. [http://www.bu.edu/wcp/Papers/Poli/PoliRosa.htm Liberalism, Civic Reformism and Democracy]&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Equality of person ====
The [[Bill of Rights 1689|English Bill of Rights of 1689]] and the [[United States Constitution]] use only the term "person" in operative language involving fundamental rights and responsibilities, except for (a) a reference to "men" in the English Bill of Rights regarding men on trial for treason; and (b) a rule of  proportional Congressional representation in the [[Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|14th Amendment to the United States Constitution]].

As the rest of the Constitution, in its operative language the [[Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|14th Amendment to the United States Constitution]] uses the term "person" stating, for example, that "[...] nor shall any State deprive any person of life, liberty, or property, without due process of law; nor deny to any person within its jurisdiction the equal protection of the laws".

==== Equality of men and women in rights and responsibilities ====
An example of this form is the [[Tunisian Constitution of 2014]] which provides that "men and women shall be equal in their rights and duties".

==== Gender equality ====
The motto "''[[Liberté, égalité, fraternité]]''" was used during the [[French Revolution]] and is still used as an official motto of the French government. The 1789 [[Rights of Man and of the Citizen]] French Constitution is framed also with this basis in equal rights of mankind.

The [[Declaration of Independence of the United States]] is an example of an assertion of equality of men, the wording of "men" and "man" is a reference to both men and women i.e. "mankind" [[all men are created equal]]". [[John Locke]] is sometimes considered the founder of this form.

Many state constitutions in the United States also use "rights of man" language rather than "rights of person" since the noun "man" has always been a reference to and an inclusion of both men and women.{{citation needed|reason= sources needed both for the "always" bit and that it is the reason state constutions chose to say man rather than persons|date=June 2018}}

It is generally accepted by egalitarians that feminism falls under egalitarianism and that some feminists identify themselves as egalitarian which under the correct definition of the word is equality for both men and women.

=== Social egalitarianism ===
At a cultural level, egalitarian theories have developed in sophistication and acceptance during the past two hundred years. Among the notable broadly egalitarian philosophies are [[socialism]], [[communism]], [[social anarchism]], [[libertarian socialism]], [[left-libertarianism]], and [[progressivism]], some of which propound [[economic egalitarianism]]. Several egalitarian ideas enjoy wide support among [[intellectualism|intellectuals]] and in the general populations of many countries. However, whether any of these ideas have been significantly implemented in practice remains a controversial question. Anti-egalitarianism&lt;ref&gt;Sidanius, Jim, et al. "Social dominance orientation, anti‐egalitarianism and the political psychology of gender: an extension and cross‐cultural replication." European Journal of Social Psychology 30.1 (2000): 41-67.&lt;/ref&gt; or [[elitism]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://englishthesaurus.net/antonym/egalitarian/ |title=Antonyms for egalitarian |last= |first= |date= |website=English Thesaurus |publisher= |access-date=28 September 2018 |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt; is opposition to egalitarianism.

{{anchor|Finance|Financial|Economics|Economic egalitarianism}}

==== Economic ====
A very early example of equality of what might be described as outcome economic egalitarianism is the Chinese philosophy of [[agriculturalism]], which held that the economic policies of a country need to be based upon an egalitarian self sufficiency.&lt;ref name="dw"&gt;{{cite book|last=Denecke|first=Wiebke|year=2011|page=38|title=The Dynamics of Masters Literature: Early Chinese Thought from Confucius to Han Feizi|publisher=Harvard University Press}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[socialism]], [[social ownership]] of [[means of production]] is sometimes considered to be a form of economic egalitarianism because in an economy characterized by social ownership, the [[surplus product]] generated by industry would accrue to the population as a whole as opposed to a class of private owners, thereby granting each individual increased autonomy and greater equality in their relationships with one another. Although the economist [[Karl Marx]] is sometimes mistaken to be an egalitarian, Marx eschewed normative theorizing on moral principles altogether. However, Marx did have a theory of the evolution of moral principles in relation to specific [[economic system]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/egalitarianism/#KarMarEquRig|title=Egalitarianism|author=|date=16 August 2002|publisher=Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy|accessdate=20 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The American economist [[John Roemer]] has put forth a new perspective of equality and its relationship to socialism. Roemer attempts to reformulate Marxist analysis to accommodate normative principles of [[distributive justice]], shifting the argument for socialism away from purely technical and materialist reasons to one of distributive justice. Roemer argues that according to the principle of distributive justice, the traditional definition of socialism based on the principle that individual compensation be [[To each according to his contribution|proportional to the value of the labour one expends in production]] is inadequate. Roemer concludes that egalitarians must reject socialism as it is classically defined in order for equality to be realized.&lt;ref name="Socialism vs Social Democracy as Income-Equalizing Institutions, 2008"&gt;''Socialism vs Social Democracy as Income-Equalizing Institutions'', by Roemer, John. 2008. Eastern Economic Journal, vol. 34, issue 1, pp. 14–26.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Egalitarianism and non-human animals ===
Many philosophers, including Ingmar Persson,&lt;ref&gt;Persson, I. (1993) “A basis for (interspecies) equality”, in Cavalieri, P. &amp; Singer, P. (eds.) The Great Ape Project, New York: St. Martin’s Press, pp. 183-193.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Peter Vallentyne]],&lt;ref&gt;Vallentyne, P. (2005) “Of mice and men: Equality and animals”, Journal of Ethics, 9, pp. 403-433.&lt;/ref&gt; Nils Holtug,&lt;ref&gt;Holtug, N. (2007) “Equality for animals,” in Ryberg, J.; Petersen, T. S. &amp; Wolf, C. (eds.) New waves in applied ethics, Basingstoke: Palgrave Macmillan, pp. 1-24.&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Lewis Gompertz]]&lt;ref&gt;Gompertz, L. (1997 [1824]) Moral inquiries on the situation of man and of brutes, London: Open Gate.&lt;/ref&gt; have argued that egalitarianism implies that the interests of non-human animals must be taken into account as well. Philosopher Oscar Horta has further argued that "Egalitarianism implies rejecting [[speciesism]], and in practice it prescribes ceasing to exploit nonhuman animals" and that we should aid [[wild animal suffering|animals suffering in nature]].&lt;ref name="Horta2014"&gt;Horta, Oscar (2014) "Egalitarianism and Animals," Between the Species: Vol. 19: Iss. 1, Article 5.
Available at: http://digitalcommons.calpoly.edu/bts/vol19/iss1/5&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, Horta argues that "because [nonhuman animals] are worse off in comparison to humans, egalitarianism prescribes giving priority to the interests of nonhuman animals."&lt;ref name="Horta2014" /&gt;

=== Religious and spiritual egalitarianism ===
==== Sikhism ====
The [[Sikhism|Sikh]] faith was founded upon egalitarian principles, reaffirming the notion of equality not only based upon race, but also between the genders. This equality led to denunciation of [[Sati (practice)|sati]], the practice of widows sacrificing themselves on the [[Pyre|funeral pyres]] of deceased husband, but which actually occurred due to the wives of warriors preferring to commit self-immolation over becoming the bounty of war for the Central Asians that were waging wars in India and Afghanistan during the early Ghazni wars.{{Citation needed|date=June 2018}} The scriptural injunction is often ascribed as providing women in the Sikh faith equal rights to practice their faith and be regarded as created equal in the eyes of God. Whilst the noble premise to strive for egalitarianism, many Sikhs still practice strong tribal casteism, with greater rigidity than the [[Hinduism|Hindu]] archetype from which the practice was inherited.&lt;ref name="Darshan, S. T 2013"&gt;Darshan, S. T. "7 Sikhism and development: a perfect match?." Handbook of Research on Development and Religion (2013): 97.&lt;/ref&gt;  Despite the rhetoric of equality, scholars have "found contradictions in the Sikh rhetoric of equality and widespread discrimination against Sikh's of low castes".&lt;ref name="Darshan, S. T 2013"/&gt; Furthermore, despite many Sikh scholars decreeing the egalitarian tenets of Sikhism, denouncing sexism, female infanticide, dowry, sati or the condemning of widows to a life of solitude and isolation—the reality is these practices have remained prevalent whilst they have long fallen out of favour with the other ethnocultural religious groups in the Indian continent, like [[Hinduism|Hindus]], [[Buddhism|Buddhists]] and [[Jainism|Jains]].&lt;ref&gt;Singh, I. J. "What sikhism says about gender and sex." International Sikh Conferences. 2004.&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Christianity ====
{{Main|Christian egalitarianism|Christian communism|Christian universalism}}
The [[Christian egalitarianism|Christian egalitarian]] view holds that the [[Bible]] teaches the fundamental equality of people of all racial and ethnic mixes, all economic classes and all age groups, but within the teachings and example of [[Jesus Christ]], [[God in Christianity|God]] and the overarching principles of scripture.&lt;ref&gt;Stagg, Evelyn and Frank. ''Woman in the World of Jesus.'' Philadelphia: Westminster Press, 1978. {{ISBN|0-664-24195-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Within the wide range of [[Christianity]] there are dissenting views to this from opposing groups, some of which are [[Complementarianism|complementarians]]. There are many{{who|date=June 2018}} that say that the Bible encourages equality and also encourages law and order and social structure (for example, parents having authority over their children and husbands authority over their wives). These ideas are considered by some{{who|date=June 2018}} to be contrary to the ideals of egalitarianism.

==== Judaism ====
[[Judaism]] is a [[Universalism|universalist]] religion due to the belief that one God created the entire universe. A further distinction has to be made however. Judaism teaches that [[Jews]] (defined as either the biological descendants of [[Jacob]] "Israel", the son of Isaac and grandson of [[Abraham]] or someone who converted) have a specific covenant with [[God in Judaism|God]] as a [[chosen people]] ([[Deutoronomy]] 7:6 "chosen as God's [[Jews as the chosen people|treasured people]]") to serve as an example of [[Divine light|God's light]] to the rest of the world. The oral Torah and [[Rabbinic literature]] codified in the [[Talmud]] makes key distinctions in religious and legal contexts between Jews and the [[gentile]]s (literally, "the nations"). However, Judaism teaches that all people are the creations of God and are commanded in the seven universal moral laws known as the [[Seven Laws of Noah]]. In this aspect, Judaism is universalist in its divine message, but not in its religious obligations. In [[Reform Judaism|reform]] and [[conservative Judaism]], egalitarian refers to nullification of religious gender separations. [[Synagogue]]s that identify as egalitarian allow mixed seating (i.e. no [[mechitza]]) and allow women to lead [[Jewish prayer|services]] with men in attendance as well as read publicly from the [[Torah]].

==== Islam ====
The [[Islam]]ic stance on equality stresses that all humans are equal in the eyes of God, regardless of gender, class and race. The [[Quran]] states: "O mankind, indeed We have created you from male and female and made you peoples and tribes that you may know one another. Indeed, the most noble of you in the sight of Allah is the most righteous of you. Indeed, Allah is Knowing and Acquainted".  Louise Marlow's ''Hierarchy and Egalitarianism in Islamic Thought'' compares the egalitarianism of early Islam to current practice.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.jstor.org/discover/10.2307/4311272?uid=3739560&amp;uid=2&amp;uid=4&amp;uid=3739256&amp;sid=21104297963707 |title=Hierarchy and Egalitarianism in Islamic Thought by Louise Marlow |last1=Poonawala |first1=Ismail K. |date=Summer 1999 |website=www.jstor.org |publisher=Iranian Studies Vol. 32, No. 3 (Summer, 1999), pp. 405–407|accessdate=10 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Modern egalitarianism theory ===
Modern egalitarianism is a theory that rejects the classic definition of egalitarianism as a possible achievement economically, politically and socially. Modern egalitarianism theory (or&amp;nbsp; "new egalitarianism") outlines that if everyone had the same opportunity cost, then there would be no comparative advances and no one would gain from trading with each other. In essence, the immense gains people receive from trading with each other arise because they are unequal in characteristics and talents—these differences may be innate or developed so that people can gain from trading with each other.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://0-web.b.ebscohost.com.millenium.itesm.mx/ehost/pdfviewer/pdfviewer?vid=8&amp;sid=f2c02b96-fed4-4085-a57d-9fef664ae057%40sessionmgr101|title=Egalitarianism:Fair and Equal?

== Reception {{anchor|criticisms}} ==
The [[cultural theory of risk]] holds egalitarianism as defined by (1) a negative attitude towards rules and principles; and (2) a positive attitude towards group decision-making, with [[fatalism]] termed as its opposite.&lt;ref name="Thompson 1990"/&gt; The theory distinguishes between [[hierarchy|hierarchists]], who are positive towards both rules and groups; and egalitarianists, who are positive towards groups, but negative towards rules.&lt;ref name="Thompson 1990"&gt;Thompson et al., ''Cultural Theory'' (1990)&lt;/ref&gt; This is by definition a form of "anarchist equality" as referred to by [[Alexander Berkman|Berkman]]. The fabric of an "egalitarianist society" is thus held together by cooperation and implicit [[peer pressure]] rather than by explicit rules and punishment. However, Thompson et al. theorise that any society consisting of only one perspective, be it egalitarianist, hierarchist, [[Individualism|individualist]], [[fatalist]] or [[Autonomism|autonomist]], will be inherently unstable: the claim is that an interplay between all these perspectives are required if each perspective is to be fulfilling. For instance, although an individualist according to cultural theory is aversive towards both principles and groups, individualism is not fulfilling if individual brilliance cannot be recognised by groups, or if individual brilliance cannot be made permanent in the form of principles.&lt;ref name="Thompson 1990"/&gt; Accordingly, egalitarianists have no power except through their presence, unless they (by definition, reluctantly) embrace principles which enable them to cooperate with fatalists and hierarchists. They will also have no individual sense of direction in the absence of a group. This could be mitigated by following individuals outside their group: autonomists or individualists.

[[Alexander Berkman]] suggests that "equality does not mean an equal amount but equal opportunity [...] Do not make the mistake of identifying equality in liberty with the forced equality of the convict camp. True anarchist equality implies freedom, not quantity. It does not mean that every one must eat, drink, or wear the same things, do the same work, or live in the same manner. Far from it: the very reverse in fact [...] Individual needs and tastes differ, as appetites differ. It is equal opportunity to satisfy them that constitutes true equality [...] Far from levelling, such equality opens the door for the greatest possible variety of activity and development. For human character is diverse".&lt;ref&gt;Alexander Berkman ''What is Anarchism?'' pp. 164–165.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Marxism ===
[[Karl Marx]] and [[Friedrich Engels]] believed that a revolution would bring about a [[Socialism|socialist]] society which would then eventually give way to a [[Communism|communist]] stage of social development, which would be a classless, stateless, humane society erected on common ownership and the principle of "From each according to his ability, to each according to his needs".

However, [[Marxism]] rejected egalitarianism in the sense of greater equality between classes, clearly distinguishing it from the socialist notion of the abolition of classes based on the division between workers and owners of productive property. Marx's view of classlessness was not the subordination of society to a universal interest (such as a universal notion of "equality"), but was about the creation of the conditions that would enable individuals to pursue their true interests and desires—thus Marx's notion of [[communist society]] is radically individualistic.&lt;ref name="Karl Marx on Equality"&gt;''Karl Marx on Equality'', by Woods, Allen. http://philosophy.fas.nyu.edu/docs/IO/19808/Allen-Wood-Marx-on-Equality.pdf: "Marx thinks the idea of equality is actually a vehicle for bourgeois class oppression, and something quite different from the communist goal of the abolition of classes&amp;nbsp;... A society that has transcended class antagonisms, therefore, would not be one in which some truly universal interest at last reigns, to which individual interests must be sacrificed."&lt;/ref&gt;

Marx was a proponent of two principles, the first applied to socialism and the second to an advanced communist society: "[[To each according to his contribution]]" and "[[From each according to his ability, to each according to his needs|From each according to their ability, to each according to their needs]]&lt;nowiki/&gt;". Although Marx's position is often confused or conflated with distributive egalitarianism in which only the goods and services resulting from production are distributed according to a notional equality, in reality Marx eschewed the entire concept of equality as abstract and bourgeois in nature, preferring to focus on more concrete principles such as opposition to exploitation on materialist grounds and economic logic.&lt;ref name="Rejecting Egalitarianism, 1987"&gt;''Rejecting Egalitarianism'', by Nielsen, Kai. 1987. Political Theory, Vol. 15, No. 3 (Aug., 1987), pp. 411–423.&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Language Strife''' ({{lang-sv|Finska språkstriden|lit=Finnish language dispute}}) was a major conflict in mid-19th century [[History of Finland|Finland]]. Both the [[Swedish language|Swedish]] and [[Finnish language|Finnish]] languages were commonly used in Finland at the time, associated with descendants of Swedish colonisation and leading to class tensions among the speakers of the different languages. It became acute in the mid-19th century. The competition was considered to have officially ended when Finnish gained [[official language]] status in 1923 and became equal to the Swedish language.

== Background ==
{{Main|History of Finland}}
{{See also|Finland under Swedish rule}}
Finland had once been under Swedish rule ([[Sweden-Finland]]). [[Swedish language|Swedish]] (with some [[Latin]]) was the language of administration and education in the [[Swedish Realm]]. Swedish was therefore the most-used language of administration and higher education among the Finns. To gain higher education, one had to learn Swedish, and Finnish was considered by the upper classes to be a "language of peasants".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.aleksiskivi-kansalliskirjailija.fi/elama/elamakerta/ | title = Aleksis Kivi - Kansalliskirjailija | access-date = 2017-12-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://opinnot.internetix.fi/fi/muikku2materiaalit/lukio/hi/hi3/2_autonominen_suomi/12_kielen_asema | title = Suomen kielen asema | author = Minna Helminen | publisher = Otavan Opisto | access-date = 2017-12-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; Immigration of Swedish peasants to Finland's coastal regions also boosted the status of Swedish by sheer number of speakers. Although [[Mikael Agricola]] had started written Finnish with ''[[Abckiria]]'' in the 1500s, and a Finnish translation of the [[Civil Code of 1734]] was published in 1759 (''Ruotzin waldacunnan laki''), it had no official status as a legal publication since the official language of administration was Swedish.&lt;ref name="skvkkh" /&gt;

As a result of the [[Finnish War]], Sweden ceded Finland to [[Russia]] in 1809. Finland became the autonomous [[Grand Duchy of Finland]] within the [[Russian Empire]].&lt;ref name="gmsprengtbio"&gt;{{cite web | url = https://kansallisbiografia.fi/kansallisbiografia/henkilo/602 | title = Sprengtporten, Georg Magnus (1740 - 1819) | website = Biografiakeskus | access-date = 2017-12-07 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Under Russian rule, the laws of the Sweden–Finland era remained largely unchanged, and Swedish continued to be used in administration.&lt;ref name="skvkkh"&gt;{{cite web | url = https://journal.fi/tt/article/download/616/506/ | title = Suomen kieli vallan kielenä | author = Kaisa Häkkinen | format = PDF | access-date = 2017-12-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The language strife became more acute in the second half of the 19th century. [[Johan Vilhelm Snellman]], a Swede who wished to increase education in Finland, became a chief initiator of conflict in the 1850s due to his concern about the changing language use among the educated classes, many of whom were using Russian or Finnish.&lt;ref name="snellmanbiografia"&gt;{{cite web |url= https://kansallisbiografia.fi/english/person/3639 |title= Snellman, Johan Vilhelm (1806 - 1881) |author= Matti Klinge |date= |website= The National Biography of Finland |publisher= |access-date=2017-11-24 |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt; He wrote to [[Zachris Topelius]] in 1860: "My view is this: Whether Russian or Finnish will win, only God knows. I dare not hope for anything. But that Swedish will lose - that I do know."&lt;ref name="snellmanbiografia" /&gt; [[Elias Lönnrot]] compiled the first Finnish-Swedish dictionary (''Finsk-Svenskt lexikon''), completing it in 1880.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = https://kansallisbiografia.fi/kansallisbiografia/henkilo/2836 | title = Lönnrot, Elias (1802 - 1884) | publisher = Biografiakeskus | access-date = 2017-12-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Nationalism and the question of language ==
[[File:Kiianmies Kyander graves Tampere 20090818.JPG|thumb|right|A set of graves in Tampere, showing the Swedish surname 'Kyander' as well as the Fennicized 'Kiianmies']]

The rise of [[Fennoman]]ic Finnish [[nationalism]] in the 19th century eventually led to the revived predominance of Finnish use in the country. A significant contribution to the Finnish national awakening from the mid-19th century onward came from the members of the mostly [[Swedish-speaking Finns|Swedish-speaking]] upper classes deliberately choosing to promote Finnish culture and language. Snellman was himself was an ethnic Swede and was later ennobled.  These [[Finnish Swedes]], known as the [[Fennomans]], [[Fennicization|Fennicized]] their family names, learned Finnish, and made a point of using Finnish both in public and at home. However, another group of the Swedish-speaking population, the [[Svecomans]], did not wish to abandon Swedish and opposed the Fennoman ideology and Fennoman-inspired reforms.

In 1863 [[Alexander II of Russia|Alexander II]] (AsK 26/1863) ruled that Finnish had an [[official language]] status comparable to that of Swedish; it could thereafter be used in an official capacity in legal and state office matters.&lt;ref name="kasf"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://suomifinland100.fi/project/1863-kieliasetus/ | title = 1863 kieliasetus | access-date = 2017-12-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ylevierailu" /&gt;&lt;ref name=haar&gt;{{cite book|author=Harald Haarmann |title=Modern Finland: Portrait of a Flourishing Society |publisher=McFarland |isbn=9781476625652 |page=211 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=KEA4DQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA211 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Within a generation, the Finnish language use gained predominance in the government and the society of Finland. 

During the [[Russification of Finland]], Tsar [[Nicholas II of Russia|Nicholas II]] attempted to change the official language to Russian (''Language Manifesto of 1900''), but Russification was halted by the [[Finnish general strike of 1905|general strike of 1905]].

== After independence ==
After [[Independence of Finland|Finland gained independence]] in 1917, its relations with Sweden unexpectedly became strained in connection with the [[Finnish Civil War]] and the [[Åland crisis]]. These events aggravated the language dispute, and the controversy over Swedish and Finnish became a prominent feature of domestic politics during the 1920s and 1930s.

In the newly independent [[Constitution of Finland|Finnish constitution]] of 1919, Finnish and Swedish were given equal status as national languages. The language strife thereafter centered on this and on the role of Swedish in universities, particularly regarding the number of professors who spoke and wrote in Swedish in their teaching. In the [[interwar period]], the [[University of Helsinki]] was the scene of conflict between those who wanted to advance the use of Finnish and those who wished to maintain the use of Swedish.&lt;ref name=UppslagsFiUniv&gt;{{cite web |url=http://uppslagsverket.fi/sv/sok/view-103684-Universitetsadresserna |title=Universitetsadresserna |author=Lasse Sundman |date=2011-04-24 |website=[[Uppslagsverket Finland]] |publisher= |access-date=2017-11-30 |quote= |language=Swedish}}&lt;/ref&gt; Geographer [[Väinö Tanner (geographer)|Väinö Tanner]] was one of the most vocal defenders of Swedish.&lt;ref name=UppslagsverketFi&gt;{{cite web |url=http://uppslagsverket.fi/sv/sok/view-103684-TannerVaeinoe |title=Tanner, Väinö |author=Johan Lindberg |date=2011-08-05 |website=[[Uppslagsverket Finland]] |publisher= |access-date=2017-11-30 |quote= |language=Swedish}}&lt;/ref&gt; A campaign initiated by the [[Swedish People's Party of Finland]] collected 153,914 signatures in defense of Swedish in a petition that was presented  to the parliament and government in October 1934.&lt;ref name=UppslagsFiUniv/&gt; The conflict at the university generated an international reaction when academics from Denmark, Sweden, Norway, and Iceland sent letters to the diplomatic representatives of Finland in their respective countries warning that diminishing the role of Swedish at the university would result in a weakening of Nordic unity.&lt;ref name=UppslagsFiUniv/&gt;

The government issued a language decree on 1 January 1923 making Finnish and Swedish equal in status.&lt;ref name="ylevierailu"&gt;{{cite web | url = https://yle.fi/aihe/artikkeli/2013/06/11/keisarivierailu-vauhditti-yhteiskunnan-muutosta | title = Keisarivierailu vauhditti yhteiskunnan muutosta | author = Rita Trötschkes | publisher = Yle | date = 2013-12-09 | access-date = 2017-12-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;
 
During the resettlement of more than 420,000 [[Karelia]]n refugees after the [[Winter War]] against the Soviet Union (1939–1940), the Swedish-speaking minority feared that the new Finnish-speaking settlers would change the linguistic balance of their neighborhoods. Since the late 20th century, there has been discussion of whether the policy of [[mandatory Swedish]] classes in schools should continue.

'''''Gender Wars''''' is a [[real-time tactics]] [[action game]] developed by The 8th Day and  [[Sales Curve]] and published for [[MS-DOS]] by [[GT Interactive Software]] and Sales Curve Interactive in 1996.

==Gameplay==
{{expand section|date=August 2015}}
The player controls a squad leader and any of his or her members, as they kill enemies, destroy enemy facilities, or retrieve devices. However, the player will have to control each member at a time, as they have difficulty navigating by themselves.

==Plot==
{{expand section|date=August 2015}}
In the future, after an era of "[[Political Correctness]] and equality",&lt;ref&gt;[http://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/e664f315ab72fc8a3621f9fbef9fe13e-650-80.jpg]&lt;/ref&gt; humanity is divided into two hostile factions. Each faction represents one of humanity's two genders, the Males (who are ruled by a Patriarch) and the Females (who are ruled by a Matriarch), both of which behave in stereotypical manners (for instance, the Males being crude and focusing too much of drinking beer, the Females being easily distracted by fashion-related merchandise), and which may try to eliminate each other and capture each other's rulers. Either faction sometimes conduct raids against the other faction to steal reproductive cells, in order to produce more members for each side.

The player has to choose between the Male faction (who tries to capture the Matriarch) or the Female faction (who tries to capture the Patriarch). Regardless of the player's initial choice, the victorious faction of the two will put the remaining members of the defeated faction into servitude. The game ends by mentioning a rebellion caused by men and women working together, taking place a few years after the end of the Gender Wars.

==Reception==
[[GameSpot]] gave ''Gender Wars'' a "Fair" review score of 6.6/10, opining it is "a solid arcade strategy game that doesn't require lots of concentration, and has enough depth to keep things interesting. This basic premise, along with the game's original story line, good video and sound, and surprisingly good gameplay, make for a very engaging title."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gamespot.com/reviews/gender-wars-review/1900-2536230/ |title=Gender Wars Review |publisher=GameSpot |date=1996-09-06 |accessdate=2015-08-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; A retrospective by Richard Cobbett of ''[[PC Gamer]]'' called it "a rubbish ''[[Syndicate (video game)|Syndicate]]'' wannabe," one which still handles its subject "better than ''[[Rex Nebular and the Cosmic Gender Bender]]''."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Richard Cobbett |url=http://www.pcgamer.com/saturday-crapshoot-gender-wars/ |title=Saturday Crapshoot: Gender Wars |publisher=PC Gamer |date=2011-09-17 |accessdate=2015-08-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Lunule.JPG|thumb|300px|Provincial "dot-line" lunula from Kerivoa in [[Brittany]]]]

The '''Gold lunula''' (plural: '''lunulae''') is a distinctive type of late [[Neolithic]], [[Chalcolithic]] or (most often) early [[Bronze Age]] necklace or collar shaped like a crescent moon.&lt;ref&gt;The [[British Museum]] describe the (Irish) Blessington lunula (illustrated) as "Late Neolithic/Early Bronze Age, 2400BC-2000BC (circa)", [https://www.britishmuseum.org/research/collection_online/collection_object_details.aspx?objectId=818350&amp;partId=1 webpage]&lt;/ref&gt; They are normally flat and thin, with roundish spatulate terminals that are often twisted to 45 to 90 degrees from the plane of the body. Gold lunulae fall into three distinct groups, termed Classical, Unaccomplished and Provincial by archaeologists.  Most have been found in Ireland, but there are moderate numbers in other parts of Europe as well, from Great Britain to areas of the continent fairly near the Atlantic coasts.  Although no lunula has been directly dated, from associations with other artefacts it is thought they were being made sometime in the period between 2200–2000 BC;&lt;ref&gt;Needham 1996, 124&lt;/ref&gt; a wooden box associated with one Irish find has recently given a [[radiocarbon dating]] range of 2460–2040 BC.&lt;ref&gt;Cahill, 277, dates "CalBC (at 95% probability)"; 276–278 discuss the dating of Irish lunulae, without reaching very firm conclusions.&lt;/ref&gt;

Of the more than a hundred gold lunulae known from Western Europe, more than eighty are from Ireland;&lt;ref&gt;Wallace, 49&lt;/ref&gt; it is possible they were all the work of a handful of expert goldsmiths, though the three groups are presumed to have had different creators. Several examples have a heavily crinkled appearance suggesting that they had been rolled up at some point. One Irish example, from Ballinagroun, has had its original Classical engraved decoration beaten over to erase it (not quite successfully), and then a new Unaccomplished scheme added (see below for these classifications).&lt;ref&gt;Taylor, 1980, 33; illustrated at Wallace 2:21&lt;/ref&gt; This and the fact that it had been folded over several times suggest that it had been in use for a long time before it was deposited.&lt;ref&gt;Wallace, 60&lt;/ref&gt; The first two examples illustrated show roughly the range of widths of the lowest part of the lunula that is found.  Finds in graves are rare, perhaps suggesting they were regarded as clan or group property rather than personal possessions, and though some were found in bogs, perhaps suggesting ritual deposits, more were found on higher ground, often under standing stones.&lt;ref&gt;Taylor, 1980, 28&lt;/ref&gt;

Most gold lunulae have decorative patterns very much resembling [[Beaker culture|beaker pottery]] from roughly the same period, using geometrical patterns made up of straight lines, with zig-zags and criss-cross patterns, and many different axes of symmetry. The curving edges of the lunula are generally followed by curving border-lines, often with decoration between them. The decoration is typically most dense at the tips and edges, and the broad lower central area is often undecorated between the borders.&lt;ref&gt;Wallace, 49–50; Taylor 1980, 28ff&lt;/ref&gt; The decoration also resembles that on [[amber]] and [[Jet (lignite)|jet]] spacer necklaces, which are thought to be slightly later in date.

==Typology==
Gold lunulae have been classified into groups as follows:&lt;ref&gt;Wallace, 50; Taylor 1980, 27 onwards&lt;/ref&gt;
*Classical, perhaps all made in Ireland, on average the widest, heaviest and also thinnest group. They are thin enough to be flexible when worn, and for the incised decoration to appear as relief on their underside.  One aspect of the skill with which they are made is the variation in thickness across the piece, with the inner edge often three times thicker than the middle and the outer edge twice as thick.&lt;ref&gt;Taylor, 1980, 35&lt;/ref&gt;  
*Unaccomplished, similar but narrower and less skilfully executed, all Irish
*Provincial, only one example found in Ireland. Thicker and more rigid, they were probably all or mostly made outside Ireland. Their decoration can be more varied, and is divided into two groups: "dot-line", found in Scotland and Wales, and "linear", found in Cornwall, Belgium and north Germany, as well as the Irish example. The northern coast of France has both types.  Punches, not otherwise used in lunulae, are used for the dots in "dot-line" types.&lt;ref&gt;Taylor, 1980, 33&lt;/ref&gt;

It used to thought that these groups were produced in chronological sequence, but this is now much less certain, although the Ballinagroun lunula does show Unaccomplished decoration replacing Classical when it was reworked. In one large sample of 39 lunulae, the 19 Classical averaged 54 grams, with the 12 Unaccomplished averaging 40 gm.&lt;ref&gt;Taylor, 1980, 28&lt;/ref&gt;  Finds of Classical lunulae are concentrated in the north of Ireland, probably near the sources of gold, with Unaccomplished find spots mostly forming a "peripheral border" around this area. A few Classical lunulae have been found on the north Cornish coast and in southern Scotland.&lt;ref&gt;Taylor, 1980, 33&lt;/ref&gt;

Three Provincial lunulae were discovered in Kerivoa, [[Brittany]] (Kerivoa-en-Bourbriac, [[Côtes-d'Armor]]) in the remains of a box with some sheet gold and a rod of gold. The rod had its terminals hammered flat in the manner of the lunuae. From this it is thought that Lunulae were made by hammering a rod of gold flat so it became sheet-like and fitted the desired shape. Decoration was then applied by impressing designs with a stylus. The stylus used often leaves tell-tale impressions on the surface of the gold and it is thought that all the lunulae from Kerivoa, and another two from Saint-Potan, [[Brittany]] and [[Harlyn]] Bay, [[Cornwall]] were all made with the same tool. This suggests that all five lunulae were the work of one craftsperson and the contents of the Kerivoa box their tools of trade.&lt;ref&gt;Taylor, 1980, 34&lt;/ref&gt;

Lunulae were probably replaced as neck ornaments firstly by gold [[torc]]s, found from the Irish Middle Bronze Age, and then in the Late Bronze Age by the spectacular [[gorget]]s of thin ribbed gold, some with round discs at the side, of which 9 examples survive, 7 in the [[National Museum of Ireland]].&lt;ref&gt;Wallace, 88–89; 3:19–25&lt;/ref&gt;

The shape is sometimes found into the [[Iron Age]], now also in silver, though the relation to the much earlier Bronze Age lunulae may be tenuous.  A bronze example from the Welsh [[Llyn Cerrig Bach]] lake deposit (200 BC – 100 AD) has an embossed medallion with a [[triskele]]-based design in Celtic [[La Tène]] style, although it lacks the fastening at the back and has holes that are presumably for fixing it to a surface.  It has been suggested it fitted around the pole of a [[chariot]], or was attached to a shield, or worn by a statue.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.museumwales.ac.uk/en/2365/ National Museum of Wales, "Crescentic-shaped plaque"]&lt;/ref&gt; Two silver examples from [[Chão de Lamas]] in Portugal of about the 2nd century BC should perhaps be considered as flattened and widened [[torc]]s; similar pieces are worn by figures in sculpture from the same culture.

==Recent finds==
The known corpus continues to expand slowly. The UK [[Portable Antiquities Scheme]] has recorded three incomplete finds in England in recent years, in 2008, 2012 and 2014, the last only missing one terminal.&lt;ref&gt;[https://finds.org.uk/database/search/results/q/lunula/sort/objectType/objectType/LUNULA Portable Antiquities Scheme Database], accessed 23 March 2015&lt;/ref&gt;  In 2009 the [[Coggalbeg hoard]] surfaced in Ireland; it had actually been discovered in 1945 when cutting peat, but kept hidden. The hoard, including a lunula of the Classical type, is now in the National Museum of Ireland.&lt;ref&gt;"[http://irisharchaeology.ie/2013/02/stolen-treasure-the-coggalbeg-hoard/ Stolen treasure: The Coggalbeg Hoard]".

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9557">In [[physics]], a '''gravitational field''' is a [[scientific model|model]] used to explain the influence that a massive body extends into the space around itself, producing a force on another massive body.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author-link=Richard Feynman |first=Richard |last=Feynman |title=The Feynman Lectures on Physics |volume= I |publisher=Addison Wesley Longman |year=1970 |isbn=978-0-201-02115-8 |url=http://www.feynmanlectures.caltech.edu/I_07.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, a gravitational [[Field (physics)|field]] is used to explain [[Gravity|gravitational]] phenomena, and is measured in [[newton (unit)|newtons]] per [[kilogram]] (N/kg). In its original concept, [[gravity]] was a [[force]] between point [[mass]]es. Following [[Isaac Newton]], [[Pierre-Simon Laplace]] attempted to model gravity as some kind of [[radiation]] field or [[fluid]], and since the 19th century explanations for gravity have usually been taught in terms of a field model, rather than a point attraction.

In a field model, rather than two particles attracting each other, the particles distort [[spacetime]] via their mass, and this distortion is what is perceived and measured as a "force". In such a model one states that matter moves in certain ways in response to the curvature of spacetime,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

==Classical mechanics==

In [[classical mechanics]] as in [[physics]], a gravitational field is a physical quantity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author-link=Richard Feynman |first=Richard |last=Feynman |title=The Feynman Lectures on Physics |volume= II |publisher=Addison Wesley Longman |year=1970 |isbn=978-0-201-02115-8 |url=http://www.feynmanlectures.caltech.edu/II_01.html#Ch1-S2 |quote="A “field” is any physical quantity which takes on different values at different points in space."}}&lt;/ref&gt; A gravitational field can be defined using [[Newton's law of universal gravitation]]. Determined in this way, the gravitational field {{math|'''g'''}} around a single particle of mass {{math|''M''}} is a [[vector field]] consisting at every point of a [[Vector (geometry)|vector]] pointing directly towards the particle. The magnitude of the field at every point is calculated applying the universal law, and represents the force per unit mass on any object at that point in space. Because the force field is conservative, there is a scalar potential energy per unit mass, {{math|''Φ''}}, at each point in space associated with the force fields; this is called [[gravitational potential]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Dynamics and Relativity |first1=J. R. |last1=Forshaw |first2=A. G. |last2=Smith |publisher=Wiley |date=2009 |isbn=978-0-470-01460-8}}{{page needed|date=October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The gravitational field equation is&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Encyclopaedia of Physics |editor1-first=R. G. |editor1-last=Lerner |editor2-first=G. L. |editor2-last=Trigg |edition=2nd |publisher=[[Wiley-VCH]] |date=1991 |isbn=978-0-89573-752-6}}{{page needed|date=October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{g}=\frac{\mathbf{F}}{m}=-\frac{\mathrm{d}^2\mathbf{R}}{\mathrm{d}t^2}=-GM\frac{\mathbf{\hat R}}{\left|\mathbf{R}\right|^2}=-\nabla\Phi&lt;/math&gt;

where {{math|'''F'''}} is the [[gravitational force]], {{math|''m''}} is the mass of the [[test mass|test particle]], {{math|'''R'''}} is the position of the test particle, {{math|'''R̂'''}} is a [[unit vector]] in the direction of {{math|'''R'''}}, {{math|''t''}} is [[time]], {{math|''G''}} is the [[gravitational constant]], and {{math|∇}} is the [[del operator]].

This includes [[Newton's law of universal gravitation]], and the relation between gravitational potential and field acceleration. Note that {{math|{{sfrac|d&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;'''R'''|d''t''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;}}}} and {{math|{{sfrac|'''F'''|''m''}}}} are both equal to the [[gravitational acceleration]] {{math|'''g'''}} (equivalent to the inertial acceleration, so same mathematical form, but also defined as gravitational force per unit mass&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Essential Principles of Physics |first1=P. M. |last1=Whelan |first2=M. J. |last2=Hodgeson |edition=2nd |date=1978 |publisher=John Murray |isbn=978-0-7195-3382-2}}{{page needed|date=October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;). The negative signs are inserted since the force acts antiparallel to the displacement. The equivalent field equation in terms of mass [[density]] {{math|''ρ''}} of the attracting mass is:

:&lt;math&gt;-\nabla\cdot\mathbf{g}=\nabla^2\Phi=4\pi G\rho&lt;/math&gt;

which contains [[Gauss's law for gravity]], and [[Poisson's equation#Newtonian gravity|Poisson's equation for gravity]]. Newton's and Gauss's law are mathematically equivalent, and are related by the [[divergence theorem]]. Poisson's equation is obtained by taking the [[divergence]] of both sides of the previous equation. These classical equations are [[differential equation|differential]] [[equations of motion]] for a test particle in the presence of a gravitational field, i.e. setting up and solving these equations allows the motion of a test mass to be determined and described.

The field around multiple particles is simply the [[Vector (geometry)#Addition and subtraction|vector sum]] of the fields around each individual particle. An object in such a field will experience a force that equals the vector sum of the forces it would experience in these individual fields. This is mathematically&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Classical Mechanics |edition=2nd |first=T. W. B. |last=Kibble |series=European Physics Series |publisher=[[McGraw Hill]] |location=UK |date=1973 |isbn=978-0-07-084018-8}}{{page needed|date=October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{g}_j^\text{(net)}
=\sum_{i\ne j}\mathbf{g}_i
=\frac{1}{m_j}\sum_{i\ne j}\mathbf{F}_i
= -G\sum_{i\ne j}m_i\frac{\mathbf{\hat R}_{ij}}{\left|\mathbf{R}_i-\mathbf{R}_j\right|^2}
=-\sum_{i \ne j}\nabla\Phi_i&lt;/math&gt;

i.e. the gravitational field on mass {{math|''m&lt;sub&gt;j&lt;/sub&gt;''}} is the sum of all gravitational fields due to all other masses ''m&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;'', except the mass {{math|''m&lt;sub&gt;j&lt;/sub&gt;''}} itself. The unit vector {{math|'''R̂'''&lt;sub&gt;''ij''&lt;/sub&gt;}} is in the direction of {{math|'''R'''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt; − '''R'''&lt;sub&gt;''j''&lt;/sub&gt;}}.

==General relativity==
{{see also|Gravitational acceleration#General relativity|Gravitational potential#General relativity}}
In [[general relativity]], the [[Christoffel symbols]] play the role of the gravitational force field and the [[metric tensor (general relativity)|metric tensor]] plays the role of the gravitational potential.

In general relativity, the gravitational field is determined by solving the [[Einstein field equations]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Gravitation |first1=J. A. |last1=Wheeler |first2=C. |last2=Misner |first3=K. S. |last3=Thorne |publisher=W. H. Freeman &amp; Co |date=1973 |isbn=978-0-7167-0344-0}}{{page needed|date=October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt; \mathbf{G}=\frac{8\pi G}{c^4}\mathbf{T}&lt;/math&gt;

Here {{math|'''T'''}} is the [[stress–energy tensor]], {{math|'''G'''}} is the [[Einstein tensor]], and {{math|''c''}} is the [[speed of light]],

These equations are dependent on the distribution of matter and energy in a region of space, unlike Newtonian gravity, which is dependent only on the distribution of matter.  The fields themselves in general relativity represent the [[General relativity#Spacetime as a curved Lorentzian manifold|curvature of spacetime]].  General relativity states that being in a region of curved space is [[equivalence principle#The Einstein equivalence principle|equivalent]] to [[acceleration|accelerating]] up the [[gradient]] of the field.  By [[Newton's laws of motion#Newton's second law|Newton's second law]], this will cause an object to experience a [[fictitious force]] if it is held still with respect to the field.  This is why a person will feel himself pulled down by the force of gravity while standing still on the Earth's surface.  In general the gravitational fields predicted by general relativity differ in their effects only slightly from those predicted by classical mechanics, but there are a number of easily verifiable [[General relativity#Predictions of general relativity|differences]], one of the most well known being the [[General relativity#bending of light|bending of light]] in such fields.

The '''Hargeysa International Book Fair''' ('''HIBF''') ({{lang-so|Bandhigga Caalamiga ah ee Buugaagta Hargeysa}}) is an annual cultural event in the northwestern [[Somaliland]] region of [[Somalia]]. It is one of the largest public [[book fair]]s in the [[Horn of Africa]]. Every summer, HIBF brings writers, poets, artists and thinkers from Somaliland and from all over the world gather to share and discuss their art and literary productions with a wider audience. The main goal of the festival is to promote a culture of reading and writing in the region by producing and publishing high quality [[Somali literature]] and translating international classical literature (including fiction, poetry and drama) into Somali. Organized by the Redsea Online Culture Foundation, the event aims to enable young people to access a range of cultural heritages, with the intention of stimulating the revival of all forms of art and human expression, including painting, poetry reciting, story-telling, drama composition and writing.

==History==
===Origins===
The Hargeysa International Book Fair was inaugurated in 2008 by [[Jama Musse Jama]], who serves as Director.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Announcement: 2010 Hargeysa International Book Fair (HIBF) 23rd of July to the 27th of July 2010 in Hargeysa|url=http://www.baadiya.com/View.aspx?ID=403|publisher=Baadiya|accessdate=18 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; It grew from 200 to 10,000 participants over the following six years.

===Significance===
HIBF targets not only a young audience, but wider sectors of society. It aims to help foster cultural understanding, tolerance, democracy, and an appreciation of the diversity of Somali culture and literature. In the past few years, the Redsea Online Culture Foundation's festivals have served to raise the profile of reading and writing in the Somaliland region, and also unite youth from different provinces in the area. The main goal of the book fair is to promote critically thinking cultural and creative writing, to facilitate the habit of reading, to display books, from both local and writers abroad, to encourage members in the public to browse, read, engage with authors, serve as an inspiration to young people, and the wider society.

===Parallel events and joint ventures===
''Somaliland Moving Library'': The Moving Library Tour is the Book Fair's flagship outreach event. An exciting initiative, it takes place a week before the opening of the festival in Hargeisa and is held across all regions of Somaliland. It aims to bring the ethos and principles of the Book Fair – of citizenship and creative freedoms – closer to aspiring writers and readers outside of the city.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5438">'''''Interdisciplinary Arts''''' is an academic department in the School of Media Arts at [[Columbia College Chicago]]. As one of the earliest interdisciplinary arts programs in the United States, it has been an incubator for new approaches towards art making that has shaped the development of arts professionals for over thirty-three years. Guided by the principle that [[interdisciplinarity]] "is a defining characteristic of contemporary art practice" &lt;ref&gt;Interdisciplinary Arts Department, [http://www.colum.edu/interarts/ "Interdisciplinary Arts Department Mission Statement"], Retrieved 6 Nov 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; and "a necessary prerequisite for those artists who will shape the future of creative practice",&lt;ref&gt;Interdisciplinary Arts Department, [http://www.colum.edu/interarts/ "Interdisciplinary Arts Department Homepage"], Retrieved 6 Nov 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; the artists who work in the Interdisciplinary Arts department investigate new terrain.

Examining concepts, forms and techniques from across the fine, performing and media arts, students work with a diverse array of unique and experimental approaches that interrogate artist books, installations, gesture and movement, sound art, durational performance, interactive media, video, performance media, papermaking, letterpress, etching and offset printing, electronically controlled artworks, online artwork, performance in artificial spaces, democratic multiples, written, spoken and performed text, dramatic forms, DIY/DIT collaborative strategies and relational art forms.

== History ==
Interdisciplinary Arts was formulated in Chicago Il, 1976, by [[Suzanne Cohan-Lange]], Jean Unsworth, and Rebecca Ruben.&lt;ref&gt;Watkins, Beverly T., In Non-Traditional, Interdisciplinary Study at Columbia College, Artists Get a Chance to Broaden Their Horizons, Hone Creativity, [http://www.eric.ed.gov:80/ERICWebPortal/custom/portlets/recordDetails/detailmini.jsp?_nfpb=true&amp;_&amp;ERICExtSearch_SearchValue_0=EJ416792&amp;ERICExtSearch_SearchType_0=no&amp;accno=EJ416792 "Chronicle of Higher Education"], v37 n3 pA17,20 Sep 19 1990, {{ISSN|0009-5982}}, Retrieved 9 Nov 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; Originally accepted by the Chicago Consortium of Colleges as a program taught across several universities, in 1981, it was established as a department with a permanent home at [[Columbia College Chicago]].&lt;ref&gt;Columbia College Oral History Project, [http://www.lib.colum.edu/archives/oralhistory/index.php "Columbia College Oral History Project"], Retrieved 9 Nov 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; At that time, the Interdisciplinary Arts MA program was formalized within the context of the department. Since then, two MFA degrees were added: the Interdisciplinary Book &amp; Paper Arts MFA, launched in 1994; and the Interdisciplinary Arts &amp; Media MFA, launched in 2002. The founding of the Interdisciplinary Arts program is preceded by the undergraduate program in the [[Studio for Interrelated Media]] program founded by [[Harris Barron]] in 1969 at the [[Massachusetts College of Art and Design]] in Boston.

==Programs==
The Interdisciplinary Arts MA is for art teachers who want to expand their repertoire of techniques, as well as assist practicing artists in expanding their practice to include new media. It is immersed in the five traditional art media that make up the heart of the program: visual art, movement, sound, writing, and drama.

The Interdisciplinary Book &amp; Paper Arts MFA program enables students to participate in the contemporary art world by encouraging them to consider book and paper as a site for interdisciplinary practice. It promotes the understanding of hand papermaking and the book arts as artistic media with applications in cultural discourse, community building, and collaborative practice.

The Interdisciplinary Arts &amp; Media MFA fosters an innovative dialog between the fine, performing and media arts. It is a graduate program for traditional and performing artists who want to incorporate media into their artistic practice and for media artists who want to expand into areas such as performance, installation, interactive, and relational art forms.

==Facilities==
In the 916 S. Wabash building are housed the departmental offices, faculty offices, conference room, lecture hall, two smart classrooms, large computer lab, three installation labs and the media equipment center. Additionally, the [[Center for Book and Paper Arts]] is part of the Interdisciplinary Arts department. The [[Center for Book and Paper Arts]] occupies the entire second floor of the historic [[Ludington Building]] at 1104 South Wabash and includes a papermaking studio, a letterpress facility, a bookbindery, a gallery, a smart classroom, a multi-purpose space for performance and lectures, a computer laboratory, a critique room, studio space for artists, a resource room, and offices for the staff.  Also at 1104 South Wabash are studio spaces for the MFA students.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1941">'''Interpretive communities''' are a theoretical concept stemming from [[reader-response criticism]] and publicized by [[Stanley Fish]] although it was in use in other fields and may be found as early as 1964 in the "Historical News and Notices" of the ''Tennessee Historical Quarterly'' (p.&amp;nbsp;98) and also, and again before Fish's usage, in Richard Crouter's 1974 "H. Reinhold Neibuhr and Stoicism" in ''The Journal of Religious Ethics''.
They appeared in an article by Fish in 1976 entitled "Interpreting the ''Variorum''".&lt;ref&gt;Stanley Fish, ''Is There A Text in This Class'', Harvard U. Press, (1980), 147–174&lt;/ref&gt; Fish's theory states that a text does not have meaning outside of a set of cultural assumptions regarding both what the characters mean and how they should be interpreted. This cultural context often includes [[Authorial intentionality|authorial intent]], though it is not limited to it. Fish claims that we as individuals interpret texts because each of us is part of an interpretive community that gives us a particular way of reading a text. Furthermore, he claims, we cannot know whether someone is a part of our interpretive community or not, because any act of communication that we could engage in to tell whether we are part of the same interpretive community would have to be interpreted. That is, because we cannot escape our interpretive community, we can never really know its limits.

The idea has been very influential in reader-response criticism, though it has also been very controversial. It is often interpreted as a relativistic standpoint that "words have no meaning," though this is not what Fish means. Quite the contrary, Fish is a staunch advocate of his own readings of various texts. Rather, he means to point out that readings of a text are culturally constructed.

George - research sea shelf oceanography plymouth]&lt;/ref&gt; noted as being the originator of [[Kernewek Kemmyn]], an orthography for the [[Cornish language]] which he claims is more faithful to Middle Cornish [[phonology]] than its precursor ([[Unified Cornish]]).

George has published over eighty items relating to Celtic linguistics, including several dictionaries of Cornish. His edition of the recently discovered Middle Cornish play ''[[Bewnans Ke]]'' was published by the [[Kesva an Taves Kernewek|Cornish Language Board]] in May 2006.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.howlsedhes.co.uk/bywnanske/ Bywnans Ke Published] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060704042738/http://www.howlsedhes.co.uk/bywnanske/ |date=2006-07-04 }}&lt;/ref&gt; George received a Commendation for this work in the 2007 Holyer an Gof awards. He has translated numerous hymns and songs into Cornish, and also the lyrics of ''[[The Magic Flute|Die Zauberflöte]]''. He has composed a substantial amount of poetry in Cornish, including the full-length play ''Flogholeth Krist,'' in the style of the [[Ordinalia]].

George lives in [[Cornwall]], and speaks [[Breton language|Breton]] and [[French language|French]] as well as [[English language|English]] and Cornish. George was formerly Principal Lecturer in Ocean Science in the Institute of Marine Studies at the [[University of Plymouth]].

George was made a [[Bard]] of [[Gorseth Kernow]] in 1979, taking the [[Bardic name]] ''Profus an Mortyd'' ('Tide Predictor'). This reflected one of his research interests in oceanography, the other being numerical modelling. He has over fifty publications in the oceanographic field, including the textbook ''Tides for Marine Studies'', which has sold over 1000 copies.

George is a [[Gorseth Kernow]] representative committee member of the [[Kesva an Taves Kernewek]] (Cornish Language Board) which is a body promoting the Cornish language.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.kesva.co.uk/index.php?id=59 Kesva an Taves Kernewek (Cornish Language Board)]&lt;/ref&gt;

George took early retirement in 2006, and has recently{{when|date=February 2017}} been learning Japanese.{{citation needed|date=February 2017}}

Laurence Waddell was born on 29 May 1854, and was the son of Rev. Thomas Clement Waddell, a Doctor of Divinity at [[Glasgow University]] and Jean Chapman, daughter of John Chapman of Banton, [[Stirlingshire]].&lt;ref name="Thomas, 1939"&gt;Thomas, 1939.&lt;/ref&gt; Laurence Waddell obtained a bachelor's degree in Medicine followed by a master's degree in both Surgery and Chemistry at Glasgow University in 1878. His first job was as a resident surgeon near the university and was also the President of Glasgow University's Medical Society.&lt;ref&gt;Preston, 2009: 25.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1879 he visited Ceylon and Burma and was 'irresistibly attracted' towards Buddhism which in later years led him to study the tenets, history and art of Buddhism&lt;ref&gt;
[https://archive.org/stream/b30010706#page/n11 ''The Buddhism of Tibet, or Lamaism, Preface to the Second Edition'']
&lt;/ref&gt;
. In 1880 Waddell joined the [[British Indian Army]] and served as a medical officer with the [[Indian Medical Service]] (I.M.S), subsequently he was stationed in India and the Far East ([[Tibet]], China and [[Burma]]). The following year he became a Professor of Chemistry and Pathology at the Medical College of [[Kolkata]], India. While working in India, Waddell also studied [[Sanskrit]] and edited the ''Indian Medical Gazette''. He became Assistant Sanitary Commissioner under the government of [[India]].&lt;ref name="Thomas, 1939"/&gt;

After Waddell worked as a Professor of Chemistry and Pathology for 6 years, he became involved in military expeditions across [[Burma]] and [[Tibet]].&lt;ref&gt;Preston, 2009: 30.&lt;/ref&gt; Between 1885-1887 Waddell took part in the British expedition that annexed Upper Burma, which defeated [[Thibaw Min]] the last king of the [[Konbaung dynasty]].&lt;ref&gt;Preston, 2009: 31.&lt;/ref&gt; After his return from [[Burma]] Waddell was stationed in [[Darjeeling district]], India, and was appointed Principal Medical Officer in 1888. In the 1890s Waddell, while in [[Patna]], established that [[Agam Kuan]] was part of [[Ashoka's Hell]].&lt;ref name=doa&gt;{{cite web |title=Agam Kuan |url=http://yac.bih.nic.in/Da-01.htm#AgamKuan |date= |publisher=Directorate of Archaeology, Govt. of Bihar, official website |accessdate=April 19, 2013|quote=Waddell on his exploration of the ruins of Pataliputra during 1890s identified Agam Kuan with the legendary hell built by Ashoka for torturing people as cited by the Chinese travellers of the 5th and 7th centuries A.D.}}&lt;/ref&gt; His first publications were essays and articles on medicine and zoology, most notably "The Birds of Sikkim" (1893).&lt;ref&gt;Preston, 2009: 36.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1895 he obtained a doctorate in law.&lt;ref&gt;[http://histfam.familysearch.org/getperson.php?personID=I38626&amp;tree=Fasti Waddell Archive]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Map of 1895 excavations at Pataliputra.jpg|thumb|left|Map of 1895 excavations by Laurence Waddell at [[Pataliputra]].]]  
Waddell traveled extensively in [[India]] throughout the 1890s (including [[Sikkim]] and areas on the borders of [[Nepal]] and Tibet) and wrote about the [[Buddhism|Tibetan Buddhist]] religious practices he observed there. Stationed with the [[British army]] in [[Darjeeling]], Waddell learned the [[Standard Tibetan|Tibetan language]] and even visited Tibet several times secretly, in disguise. He was the cultural consultant on the [[British expedition to Tibet|1903-1904 British invasion of Tibet]] led by [[Francis Younghusband|Colonel Sir Francis Edward Younghusband]], and was considered alongside Sir Charles Bell as one of the foremost authorities on Tibet and Tibetan Buddhism. Waddell studied archaeology and ethnology in-between his military assignments across India and Tibet, and his exploits in the Himalayas were published in his highly successful book ''Among the Himalayas'' (1899). Various archaeological excavations were also carried out and supervised by Waddell across India, including [[Pataliputra]], of which he did not receive recognition of discovery until long after his death, in 1982, by the government of Bengal. His discoveries at Pataliputra were published in an official report in 1892.&lt;ref name="Thomas, 1939"/&gt;

During the 1890s Waddell specialised in Buddhist antiquities and became a collector, between 1895-97 he published "Reports on collections of Indo-Scythian Buddhist Sculptures from the Swat Valley", in 1893 he also read a paper to the International Congress of Orientalists: "On some newly found Indo-Grecian Buddhistic Sculptures from the Swat Valley".&lt;ref name="Thomas, 1939"/&gt; In 1895 Waddell published his book ''Buddhism of Tibet or Lamaism'', which was one of the first works published in the west on [[Buddhism]]. As a collector, Waddell had come across many Tibetan manuscripts and maps, but was disappointed to not find a single reference to a lost ancient civilization, which he had hoped to discover.

Waddell continued his military service with the Indian Medical Service. He was in China during the [[Boxer Rebellion]] (1898-1901), including the [[Battle of Peking (1900)|Relief of Peking]] in August 1900, for which he was [[Mentioned in Despatches|mentioned in despatches]], received the [[China War Medal (1900)]] with clasp, and was in 1901 appointed a [[Order of the Indian Empire|Companion of the Order of the Indian Empire]] (CIE).&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette |issue=27337 |date=24 July 1901 |page=4917 |supp=y}}&lt;/ref&gt; By late 1901 he had moved to [[North-West Frontier Province (1901–1955)|North-West Frontier Province]] and was present during the Mahsud-Waziri Blockade, 1901–02.  He was in Malakand in 1902 and took part in the [[British expedition to Tibet|Tibet Mission to Lhasa 1903–04]], for which he was again mentioned in despatches, received a medal with clasp and was appointed a [[Order of the Bath|Companion of the Order of the Bath]] (CB). Waddell then returned to England where he briefly became Professor of Tibetan at the University College of London (1906–1908).

In 1908, Waddell began to learn [[Sumerian language|Sumerian]].&lt;ref&gt;Preston, 2009: 20.&lt;/ref&gt; Thus in his later career he turned to studying the ancient near east, especially [[Sumer]]ia and dedicated his time to deciphering or translating ancient cuneiform tablets or seals, most notably including the [[Scheil dynastic tablet]]. In 1911, Waddell published two entries in the ''[[Encyclopædia Britannica]]''.&lt;ref&gt;“Lhasa” in Encyclopædia Britannica, (11th ed.), 1911. “Tibet” in Encyclopædia Britannica, (11th ed.), 1911.&lt;/ref&gt;  By 1917, Waddell was fully retired and first started exclusively writing on [[Aryan race|Aryans]], beginning in an article published in the ''Asiatic Review'' entitled "Aryan Origin of the World's Civilization".&lt;ref name="Thomas, 1939"/&gt; From the 1920s Waddell published several works which attempted to prove an [[Aryan]] (i.e., [[Indo-European languages|Indo-European]]) origin of the alphabet and the appearance of Indo-European myth figures in ancient Near Eastern mythologies (e.g., [[Hittites|Hittite]], [[Sumerian mythology|Sumerian]], [[Babylonia]]n). The foundation of his argument is what he saw as a persistence of cult practices, religious symbols, mythological stories and figures, and god and hero names  throughout Western and Near Eastern civilizations, but also based his arguments on his deciphered Sumerian and [[Indus Valley Civilization|Indus-Valley]] seals, and other archaeological findings.

Waddell died in 1938. That same year, he had completed writing ''Trojan Origin of World Civilization''. The book was never published.&lt;ref&gt;Preston, 2009: 194.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Discovery of Buddha's Birthplace== 
Waddell had actively travelled around British controlled India in search for [[Kapilavastu (ancient city)|Kapilavastu]], the Buddha's supposed birthplace. [[Alexander Cunningham |Cunningham]] had previously identified Kapilavastu as the village of Bhuila in India which Waddell and other orientalists concluded to be incorrect. They were searching for the birthplace by taking into account the topographical and geographical hints left by the ancient chinese travellers, Fa Hien and Hiuen Tsiang. Waddell was first to point out the importance of the discovery of Asoka's pillar in Nigliva in 1893 and estimate Buddha's birthplace as Lumbini. He subsequently corresponded with Government of India and arranged for the exploration of the area.It was also Waddell who was appointed to conduct the exploration to recover the inscriptions, etc.; but at the last moment, when due to adverse circumstances prevented him from proceeding, and Mr. [[Alois Anton Führer|Führer]] was sent to carry out the exploration arranged by him, he found the Lumbini grove, etc., with their inscriptions at the very spots pointed out by him&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;.

==Waddell's theories==

Waddell's voluminious writings after his retirement were based on an attempt to prove the [[Sumer]]ians (who he identified as [[Aryan race|Aryans]]) as the progenitors of other ancient civilizations, such as the [[Indus Valley Civilization]] and ancient Egyptians to "the classic Greeks and Romans and Ancient Britons, to whom they [the Sumerians] passed on from hand to hand down the ages the torch of civilization".&lt;ref&gt;Waddell, L. (1929). ''Makers of Civilization in Race &amp; History''. London: Luzac. p. 497.&lt;/ref&gt; He is perhaps most remembered for his controversial translations; the [[Scheil dynastic tablet]], the [[Bowl of Utu]] and [[Newton Stone]], as well as his ''[[British Edda]]''.

===Phoenicians===
{{See also|Newton Stone}}

Waddell in ''Phoenician Origin of Britons, Scots, and Anglo-Saxons'' (1924) argued for a [[Syro-Hittite states|Syro-Hittite]] and [[Phoenicia]]n colonization of the British Isles, turning to British folklore that mentions Trojans, such as the "Brutus Stone" in [[Totnes]] and [[Geoffrey of Monmouth]]; place-names that supposedly preserve the [[Hittite language]], and inscriptions, as evidence.

According to Waddell the "unknown" script on the [[Newton Stone]] is Hitto-Phoenician. His translation is as follows:

{{Quote|"This Sun-Cross (Swastika) was raised to Bil (or Bel, the God of Sun-Fire) by the Kassi (or Cassi-bel[-an]) of Kast of the Siluyr (sub-clan) of the "Khilani" (or Hittite-palace-dwellers), the Phoenician (named) Ikar of Cilicia, the Prwt (or Prat, that is 'Barat' or 'Brihat' or Brit-on)."}}

[[Brutus of Troy]], Waddell also regarded to be a real historical figure. In a chapter entitled "COMING OF THE "BRITONS" OR ARYAN BRITO-PHOENICIANS UNDER KING BRUTUS-THE-TROJAN TO ALBION ABOUT 1103, B.C", Waddell writes:

{{Quote|"This migration of King Brutus and his Trojan and Phoenician refugees from Asia Minor and Phoenicia to establish a new homeland colony in Albion, which event the British Chronicle historical tradition places at 1103 B.C. was probably associated with, and enforced by, not merely the loss of Troy, but also by the massacring invasion of Hittite Asia Minor, Cilicia and the Syria-Phoenician coast of the Mediterranean by the Assyrian King Tiglath Pileser I. about 1107 B.C. to 1105 B.C."}}

====Reception====
[[File:Lhasa and its mysteries.djvu|thumb|Book cover "[[Lhasa]] and its Mysteries" 3rd edition in 1906]]
Waddell's contemporaries reviewed the book very negatively. One reviewer considered the content to be "admirable fooling", but that he had "an uneasy feeling that the author really believes it".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Turner | first1 = R. L. | year = 1925 | title = The Phoenician Origin of Britons, Scots, and Anglo-Saxons [Review] | url = https://www.jstor.org/discover/10.2307/607096| journal = Bulletin of the School of Oriental Studies, University of London | volume = 3 | issue = 4| pages = 808–810 | doi=10.1017/s0041977x00000562}}&lt;/ref&gt; It has also been pointed out that Waddell took the ''[[Historia Regum Britanniae]]'' to be literal history which is why he was almost asking to be ridiculed by historians:

{{Quote|"Contrary to the general opinion of historians, he [Waddell] accepts as authentic the chronicle of Geoffrey of Monmouth, and regards as historical the legend of King Brut of Troy having reached Britain with his followers about the year 1103 BC, founded London a few years later, and spread through the land Phoenician culture, religion and art [...] His views indeed are so unorthodox that he is no doubt prepared for strong criticism, and even ridicule. King Brut of Troy has long been relegated to the company of old wives' tales."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Crownhart-Vaughan | first1 = E. A.

===Indus-Valley seals===
{{See also|Indus script|Dravidian people}}

The first [[Indus Valley Civilization|Indus Valley]] or [[Indus Valley Civilization|Harappan]] [[Seal (emblem)|seal]] was published by Alexander Cunningham in 1872.&lt;ref&gt;Cunningham, A., 1875. Archaeological Survey of India, Report for the Year 1872-73, 5: 105-8 and pl. 32-3. Calcutta: Archaeological Survey of India&lt;/ref&gt; It was half a century later, in 1912, when more Indus Valley seals were discovered by J. Fleet, prompting an excavation campaign under Sir John Hubert Marshall in 1921–22, resulting in the discovery of the ancient civilization at [[Harappa]] (later including [[Mohenjo-daro]]). As [[Seal (emblem)|seals]] were discovered from the Indus Valley, Waddell in 1925 first attempted to decipher them and claimed they were of [[Sumer]]ian origin in his ''Indo-Sumerian Seals Deciphered''.

====Reception====

In the 1920s, Waddell's theory that the Indus-Valley seals were Sumerian had some academic support, despite criticisms; [[Ralph Lilley Turner|Ralph Turner]] considered Waddell's work to be "fantasy".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Turner | first1 = R.

Preston however in a section of her biography of Waddell entitled "Opposition to Indo-Sumerian Seals Deciphered" points out that support for Waddell's theory had disappeared by the early 1940s through the work of [[Mortimer Wheeler]]:

{{Quote|"However, a shift, which made his [Waddell's] claim appear untenable, occurred in the consensus in archaeology after Sir Mortimer Wheeler was put in charge of the Archaeological Survey of India [...] Wheeler's interpretation of the archaeological data was the guideline for scholars who appear to have ruled out the possibility that the language of the seals could be akin to Sumerian and Proto-Elamite."&lt;ref&gt;Preston, 2009: 21.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

===Sumerian language===
{{See also|Sumerian language}}

The non-[[Semitic languages|Semitic]] source of the Sumerian language was established in the late 19th century by [[Julius Oppert]] and [[Sir Henry Rawlinson, 1st Baronet|Henry Rawlinson]] from which many different theories were proposed as to its origin. In his works ''Aryan Origin of the Alphabet'' and ''Sumer-Aryan Dictionary'' (1927) Waddell attempted to show the [[Sumerian language]] was of Aryan ([[Indo-European languages|Indo-European]]) root.

====Reception====

Waddell's Sumerian-Aryan equation did not receive any support at the time, despite having sent personal copies of his two books to [[Archibald Sayce]].&lt;ref&gt;Preston, 2009: 85.&lt;/ref&gt; Professor Langdon, who had earlier offered Waddell his support for a Sumerian or Proto-Elamite decipherment of the Indus-Valley seals, dismissed Waddell's publications on the Sumerian language itself:

{{Quote|"The author [Waddell] has slight knowledge of Sumerian, and commits unpardonable mistakes [...] The meanings assigned to Sumerian roots are almost entirely erroneous. One can only regret the publication of such fantastic theories, which cannot possibly do service to serious science in any sense whatsoever."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Langdon | first1 = S | year = 1927 | title = The Aryan Origin of the Alphabet; A Sumer-Aryan Dictionary by L. A. Waddell [Review] | url = https://www.jstor.org/discover/10.2307/25525780| journal = The Scottish Historical Review | volume = 25 | issue = 97| page = 53 }}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

===Chronology===
{{See also|Waddell's chronology}}

Waddell in ''The Makers of Civilization'' (1929) and ''Egyptian Civilization Its Sumerian Origin and Real Chronology'' (1930) revised conventional dates for most ancient civilizations and king lists. For example, he believed the [[Early Dynastic Period of Egypt]] began c. 2700 BC, not c. 3100 BC, arguing that [[Menes]], was [[Manishtushu|Manis-Tusu]], the son of Sargon, who in turn was King Minos of Crete. For Waddell, the earliest ancient rulers or mythological kings of Sumer, Egypt, Crete and the Indus Valley civilizations were 
all identical Aryan personages.

====Reception====

To support his revised chronology, Waddell acquired and translated several artefacts including the [[Scheil dynastic tablet]] and the [[Bowl of Utu]]. Waddell was praised for his acquisition of the latter.&lt;ref&gt;Preston, 2009: 143.&lt;/ref&gt; However Waddell's translations were always highly unorthodox and not taken serious. ''The Makers of Civilization'' was panned in a review by [[Harry L. Shapiro]]:

{{Quote|"The reader does not need to peruse this work very far to become aware of its distinct bias and unscientific method. Fortunately the 'Nordic race-mongers' have become discredited that there is little to fear from the effect of this opus on the intelligent lay public. Succinctly, Mr. Waddell believes that the beginning of all civilization dates from the Nordic [Aryan] Sumerians who were blond Nordics with blue eyes."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Shapiro | first1 = H. L. | year = 1930 | title = The Makers of Civilization in Race and History | url = | journal = Pacific Affairs | volume = 3 | issue = 12| pages = 1168–1169 | doi=10.2307/2750262}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Waddell during his own life, was deemed to be anachronistic by most scholars because of his supremacist views regarding the [[Aryan race]]:

{{Quote|"One of the reasons for the literary oblivion of Waddell's works on the history of civilization with an Aryan theme is [...] in relation to the fact that he did not give up the quest for the Aryans in terms of racial origins when it was abandoned in the 1870s, and it was very influential in his choice of career [...] His comparative studies and decipherment led him to a completely controversial and alternative perspective of ancient history. Furthermore, the titles that are now little known may have been sidelined due his use of the term 'Aryan' as it became associated with the rise of Nazism."&lt;ref&gt;Preston, 2009: 195.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

===Pan-Sumerism===

Waddell from 1917 (having first published the article "Aryan Origin of the World's Civilization") until his death was a proponent of [[Hyperdiffusionism in archaeology|hyperdiffusionism]] ("Pan-Sumerism") arguing that many cultures and ancient civilizations, such as the [[Indus Valley Civilization]], [[Minoan civilization|Minoan Crete]], [[Phoenicia]], and [[Early Dynastic Period of Egypt|Dynastic Egypt]], were the product of Aryan [[Sumer]]ian colonists.

[[Grafton Elliot Smith]] who pioneered hyperdiffusionism (but of the  Egyptians) was an influential correspondent to Waddell.&lt;ref&gt;Preston, 2009: 5, footnotes; "Waddell's thesis mirrored contemporary Grafton Elliot Smith's better-known theory of Egypt".&lt;/ref&gt;

====Reception====

R. Sawyer (1985) points out that Waddell "was of the eccentric opinion that Western, Indian and ancient Egyptian culture derived from a common Sumerian ancestry" and that his ideas were far-fetched to untenable.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Sawyer | first1 = R | year = 1985 | title = To Know the Histories: L. A. Waddell's Sumer and Akkad | url = | journal = Paideuma | volume = 14 | issue = 1| pages = 79–94 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Gabriel Moshenska of the UCL Institute of Archaeology has noted:

{{Quote|"Waddell's hopes of rewriting the story of civilization with the Aryan race as the first and only protagonist rapidly faded as his works and ideas remained restricted to, if well rooted in, the ultra right wing fringes of society and scholarship. J. H. Harvey, member of the pro-Nazi Imperial Fascist League and later a respected medievalist, wrote a short book ''The Heritage of Britain'' (1940) which aimed to summarise Waddell's works for a narrower audience on the fringes of the British Fascist movement (Macklin 2008). The British-Israelite W. T. F. Jarrold used Waddell's study of the Newton Stone to support a Biblical origin for the Anglo-Saxon race (1927). Today Waddell's works are read and referenced most commonly by white supremacists, esoteric scholars and conspiracy theorists such as David Icke (1999)."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.archaeologybulletin.org/article/view/bha.20106/51 The Later Works of Lieutenant-Colonel Professor Laurence Austine Waddell]&lt;/ref&gt;}}

==Collections==
Waddell collected bird specimens and it was on the basis of one of them that [[Henry Eeles Dresser|Henry Dresser]] named the species ''Babax waddelli'' (the [[giant babax]]) in 1905. His collections were donated in 1894 to the [[Hunterian Museum and Art Gallery|Hunterian Museum]] at the University of Glasgow. Some specimens are in the Manchester Museum and at the Natural History Museum at London. The [[University of Glasgow]] holds Waddell's papers and manuscript collection.

&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;In [[anthropology]], '''liminality''' (from the Latin word ''līmen'', meaning "a threshold"&lt;ref&gt;"liminal", ''Oxford English Dictionary''. Ed. J. A. Simpson and E. S. C. Weiner. 2nd ed. Oxford: Clarendon Press, 1989. OED Online Oxford 23, 2007; [[cf.]] ''[[Wiktionary:subliminal|subliminal]]''.&lt;/ref&gt;) is the quality of ambiguity or disorientation that occurs in the middle stage of [[rites]], when participants no longer hold their preritual status but have not yet begun the transition to the status they will hold when the rite is complete. During a rite's liminal stage, participants "stand at the threshold"&lt;ref&gt;("Nordic Work with Traumatised Refugees: Do We Really Care", edited by Gwynyth Overland, Eugene Guribye, Birgit)&lt;/ref&gt;  between their previous way of structuring their identity, time, or community, and a new way, which completing the rite establishes.

The concept of liminality was first developed in the early twentieth century by folklorist [[Arnold van Gennep]] and later taken up by [[Victor Turner]].&lt;ref&gt;"Liminality and Communitas", in "The Ritual Process: Structure and Anti-Structure" (New Brunswick: Aldine Transaction Press, 2008).&lt;/ref&gt; More recently, usage of the term has broadened to describe political and cultural change as well as rites.&lt;ref&gt;Bjørn Thomassen, ''The Uses and Meanings of Liminality'' (International Political Anthropology 2009) p. 51&lt;/ref&gt; During liminal periods of all kinds, social hierarchies may be reversed or temporarily dissolved, continuity of tradition may become uncertain, and future outcomes once taken for granted may be thrown into doubt.&lt;ref&gt;Agnes Horvath, Bjørn Thomassen, and Harald Wydra, ''Introduction: Liminality and Cultures of Change'' (International Political Anthropology 2009)&lt;/ref&gt; The dissolution of order during liminality creates a fluid, malleable situation that enables new institutions and customs to become established.&lt;ref&gt;Arpad Szakolczai, ''Liminality and Experience: Structuring transitory situations and transformative events'' (International Political Anthropology 2009) p. 141&lt;/ref&gt; The term has also passed into popular usage, where it is applied much more broadly, undermining its significance to some extent.&lt;ref&gt;Thomas Barfield, ''The Dictionary of Anthropology'' (1997) p. 477&lt;/ref&gt;

==Rites of passage==

===Arnold van Gennep===

Van Gennep, who coined the term liminality, published in 1909 his 'Rites de Passage', a work that explores and develops the concept of liminality in the context of rites in small-scale societies. Van Gennep began his book by identifying the various categories of rites. He distinguished between those that result in a change of status for an individual or social group, and those that signify transitions in the passage of time. In doing so, he placed a particular emphasis on [[Rite of passage|rites of passage]], and claimed that "such rituals marking, helping, or celebrating individual or collective passages through the cycle of life or of nature exist in every culture, and share a specific three-fold sequential structure".&lt;ref&gt;Szakolczai 2009, 141&lt;/ref&gt;

This three-fold structure, as established by van Gennep, is made up of the following components:&lt;ref&gt;Arnold van Gennep, ''The Rites of Passage'' (London 1977) p. 21&lt;/ref&gt;

* ''preliminal rites'' (or ''rites of separation''): This stage involves a metaphorical "death", as the initiate is forced to leave something behind by breaking with previous practices and routines.
* ''liminal rites'' (or ''transition rites''): Two characteristics are essential to these rites. First, the rite "must follow a strictly prescribed sequence, where everybody knows what to do and how".&lt;ref&gt;Szakolczai 2009, 148&lt;/ref&gt; Second, everything must be done "under the authority of a master of ceremonies".&lt;ref&gt;Szakolczai 2009, 148&lt;/ref&gt; The destructive nature of this rite allows for considerable changes to be made to the identity of the initiand. This middle stage (when the transition takes place) "implies an actual passing through the threshold that marks the boundary between two phases, and the term 'liminality' was introduced in order to characterize this passage."&lt;ref&gt;Szakolczai 2009, 141&lt;/ref&gt;
* ''postliminal rites'' (or ''rites of incorporation''): During this stage, the initiand is re-incorporated into society with a new identity, as a "new" being.

Turner confirmed his nomenclature for 'the three phases of passage from one culturally defined state or status to another...''preliminal'', ''liminal'', and ''postliminal'''.&lt;ref&gt;Victor W. Turner, ''The Ritual Process'' (Penguin 1969) p. 155.&lt;/ref&gt;

Beyond this structural template, Van Gennep also suggested four categories of rites that emerge as universal across cultures and societies. He suggested that there are four types of social rites of passage that are replicable and recognizable among many ethnographic populations.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|date=2015-01-01|url=https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/B9780080970868121026|language=en|pages=131–137|doi=10.1016/B978-0-08-097086-8.12102-6|title=International Encyclopedia of the Social &amp; Behavioral Sciences|last1=Andrews|first1=Hazel|last2=Roberts|first2=Les|isbn=9780080970875}}&lt;/ref&gt; They include:

* Passage of people from one status to another, initiation ceremonies in which an outsider is brought into the group. This includes marriage and initiation ceremonies that move one from the status of an outsider to an insider.
* Passage from one place to another, such as moving houses, moving to a new city, etc.
* Passage from one situation to another: beginning university, starting a new job, and graduating high school or university.
* Passage of time such as New Year celebrations and birthdays.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|date=2015-01-01|url=https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/B9780080970868121026|language=en|pages=131–137|doi=10.1016/B978-0-08-097086-8.12102-6|title=International Encyclopedia of the Social &amp; Behavioral Sciences|last1=Andrews|first1=Hazel|last2=Roberts|first2=Les|isbn=9780080970875}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Van Gennep considered rites of [[initiation]] to be the most typical rite. To gain a better understanding of "tripartite structure" of liminal situations, one can look at a specific rite of initiation: the initiation of youngsters into adulthood, which Turner considered the most typical rite. In such rites of passage, the experience is highly structured. The first phase (the rite of separation) requires the child to go through a separation from his family; this involves his/her "death" as a child, as [[childhood]] is effectively left behind. In the second stage, initiands (between childhood and adulthood) must pass a "test" to prove they are ready for adulthood. If they succeed, the third stage (incorporation) involves a celebration of the "new birth" of the adult and a welcoming of that being back into society.

By constructing this three-part sequence, van Gennep identified a pattern he believed was inherent in all ritual passages. By suggesting that such a sequence is universal (meaning that all societies use rites to demarcate transitions), van Gennep made an important claim (one that not many anthropologists make, as they generally tend to demonstrate [[cultural diversity]] while shying away from universality).

An anthropological rite, especially a [[rite of passage]], involves some change to the participants, especially their [[social status]].;&lt;ref&gt;Victor Turner, "Betwixt and Between: The Liminal Period in Rites de Passage", in ''The Forest of Symbols'' (Ithaca, NY: [[Cornell University Press]], 1967).&lt;/ref&gt; and in 'the first phase (of separation) comprises symbolic behaviour signifying the detachment of the individual...from an earlier fixed point in the social structure.&lt;ref&gt;Turner, ''Ritual'' p. 80&lt;/ref&gt; Their status thus becomes liminal. In such a liminal situation, "the initiands live outside their normal environment and are brought to question their self and the existing social order through a series of rituals that often involve acts of pain: the initiands come to feel nameless, spatio-temporally dislocated and socially unstructured".&lt;ref&gt;Bjørn Thomassen, "Liminality" in ''The Encyclopedia of Social Theory''(London 2006) p. 322&lt;/ref&gt; In this sense, liminal periods are "destructive" as well as "constructive", meaning that "the formative experiences during liminality will prepare the initiand (and his/her cohort) to occupy a new social role or status, made public during the reintegration rituals".&lt;ref&gt;Thomassen 2006, 322&lt;/ref&gt;

===Victor Turner===

Turner, who is considered to have "re-discovered the importance of liminality", first came across van Gennep's work in 1963.&lt;ref&gt;Thomassen 2009, 14&lt;/ref&gt; In 1967 he published his book ''The Forest of Symbols'', which included an essay entitled ''Betwixt and Between: The Liminal Period in Rites of Passage''. Within the works of Turner, liminality began to wander away from its narrow application to ritual passages in small-scale societies.&lt;ref&gt;Thomassen 2009, 14&lt;/ref&gt; In the various works he completed while conducting his fieldwork amongst the Ndembu in [[Zambia]], he made numerous connections between [[Tribe|tribal]] and non-tribal societies, "sensing that what he argued for the Ndembu had relevance far beyond the specific [[Ethnography|ethnographic]] context".&lt;ref&gt;Thomassen 2009, 14&lt;/ref&gt; He became aware that liminality "...served not only to identify the importance of in-between periods, but also to understand the human reactions to liminal experiences: the way liminality shaped personality, the sudden foregrounding of agency, and the sometimes dramatic tying together of thought and experience".&lt;ref&gt;Thomassen 2009, 14&lt;/ref&gt;

'The attributes of liminality or of liminal ''personae'' ("threshold people") are necessarily ambiguous'.&lt;ref&gt;Turner ''Ritual'' p. 81&lt;/ref&gt; One's sense of [[identity (social science)|identity]] dissolves to some extent, bringing about disorientation, but also the possibility of new perspectives. Turner posits that, if liminality is regarded as a time and place of withdrawal from normal modes of social action, it potentially can be seen as a period of scrutiny for central values and axioms of the culture where it occurs.&lt;ref&gt;Turner, ''Ritual'' p. 156&lt;/ref&gt;—one where normal limits to thought, self-understanding, and behavior are undone. In such situations, "the very structure of society [is] temporarily suspended"&lt;ref&gt;Szakolczai 2009, 142&lt;/ref&gt;

'According to Turner, all liminality must eventually dissolve, for it is a state of great intensity that cannot exist very long without some sort of structure to stabilize it...either the individual returns to the surrounding social structure...or else liminal communities develop their own internal social structure, a condition Turner calls "normative communitas"'.&lt;ref&gt;Peter Homas, ''Jung in Context'' (London 1979) p. 207&lt;/ref&gt;

The work of Victor Turner has vital significance in turning attention to this concept, introduced by Arnold van Gennep, a main intellectual opponent of [[Durkheim]], who subsequently was diverted out of anthropological and sociological thinking. However, Turner's approach to liminality has two major shortcomings. First, partly due to criticism, Turner was  keen to limit the meaning of the concept to the concrete settings of small-scale tribal societies, preferring the neologism coined by him, 'liminoid', to analyse certain features of the modern world, like theatre (Turner 1982). However, Agnes Horvath (2013) argues that the term can be applied to concrete historical events, and should be applied, as offering a vital means for historical and sociological understanding.  Second, again staying too close to his own experiences, Turner attributed a rather univocally positive connotation to liminal situations, as ways of renewal. However, liminal situations can be, and in actual fact in modern era, rather quite different: periods of uncertainty, anguish, even existential fear: a facing of the abyss in void.&lt;ref&gt;Horvath, Agnes. ''Modernism and Charisma''. Basingstoke: Palgrave, Macmillan. 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Types==
Liminality has both spatial and temporal dimensions, and can be applied to a variety of subjects: individuals, larger groups (cohorts or villages), whole societies, and possibly even entire civilizations.&lt;ref&gt;Thomassen 2009, 16&lt;/ref&gt; The following chart summarizes the different dimensions and subjects of liminal experiences, and also provides the main characteristics and key examples of each category.&lt;ref&gt;Thomassen 2009, 16&lt;/ref&gt;

{| class="wikitable"

|-
| '''''Moment''''' ||

|}

Another significant variable is "scale," or the "degree" to which an individual or group experiences liminality.&lt;ref&gt;Thomassen 2009, 17&lt;/ref&gt; In other words, "there are degrees of liminality, and…the degree depends on the extent to which the liminal experience can be weighed against persisting structures."&lt;ref&gt;Thomassen 2009, 18&lt;/ref&gt; When the spatial and temporal are both affected, the intensity of the liminal experience increases and so-called "pure liminality" is approached.&lt;ref&gt;Thomassen 2009, 18&lt;/ref&gt;

==In large-scale societies==

The concept of a liminal situation can also be applied to entire societies that are going through a crisis or a "collapse of order".&lt;ref&gt;Thomassen 2009, p. 19&lt;/ref&gt; Philosopher [[Karl Jaspers]] made a significant contribution to this idea through his concept of the "[[axial age]]", which was "an in-between period between two structured world-views and between two rounds of empire building; it was an age of creativity where 'man asked radical questions', and where the 'unquestioned grasp on life is loosened'".&lt;ref&gt;Thomassen 2009, pp. 19–20&lt;/ref&gt; It was essentially a time of uncertainty which, most importantly, involved entire civilizations. Seeing as liminal periods are both destructive and constructive, the ideas and practices that emerge from these liminal historical periods are of extreme importance, as they will "tend to take on the quality of structure".&lt;ref&gt;Thomassen 2009, p. 20&lt;/ref&gt; Events such as political or social revolutions (along with other periods of crisis) can thus be considered liminal, as they result in the complete collapse of order and can lead to significant social change.&lt;ref&gt;Thomassen 2006, p. 323&lt;/ref&gt;

Liminality in large-scale societies differs significantly from liminality found in ritual passages in small-scale societies. One primary characteristic of liminality (as defined van Gennep and Turner) is that there is a way in as well as a way out.&lt;ref&gt;Thomassen 2009, p. 21&lt;/ref&gt; In ritual passages, "members of the society are themselves aware of the liminal state: they know that they will leave it sooner or later, and have 'ceremony masters' to guide them through the rituals".&lt;ref&gt;Thomassen 2009, p. 21&lt;/ref&gt; However, in those liminal periods that affect society as a whole, the future (what comes after the liminal period) is completely unknown, and there is no "ceremony master" who has gone through the process before and that can lead people out of it.&lt;ref&gt;Thomassen 2009, p. 22&lt;/ref&gt; In such cases, liminal situations can become dangerous. They allow for the emergence of "self-proclaimed ceremony masters", that assume leadership positions and attempt to "[perpetuate] liminality and by emptying the liminal moment of real creativity, [turn] it into a scene of mimetic rivalry".&lt;ref&gt;Thomassen 2009, p. 22&lt;/ref&gt;

==Depth psychology==
Jungians have often seen the [[individuation]] process of self-realization as taking place within a liminal space.  'Individuation begins with a withdrawal from normal modes of socialisation, epitomized by the breakdown of the persona...liminality'.&lt;ref&gt;Homans 1979, 207.&lt;/ref&gt; Thus "what Turner's concept of social liminality does for status in society, Jung...does for the movement of the person through the life process of individuation".&lt;ref&gt;Hall, quoted in Miller and Jung 2004, 104.&lt;/ref&gt; Individuation can be seen as a "movement through liminal space and time, from disorientation to integration....What takes place in the dark phase of liminality is a process of breaking down...in the interest of "making whole" one's meaning, purpose and sense of relatedness once more'"&lt;ref&gt;Shorter 1988, 73, 79.&lt;/ref&gt; As an [[Jungian archetypes|archetypal]] figure, "the trickster is a symbol of the liminal state itself, and of its permanent accessibility as a source of recreative power".&lt;ref&gt;Robert Pelton in Young-Eisendrath and Dawson eds. 1997, 244&lt;/ref&gt;

But other depth psychologies speak of a similar process.  [[Carl Rogers]] describes "the 'out-of-this-world' quality that many therapists have remarked upon, a sort of trance-like feeling in the relationship that client and therapist emerge from at the end of the hour, as if from a deep well or tunnel.&lt;ref&gt;Rogers 1961, 202.&lt;/ref&gt; The French talk of how the analytic setting 'opens/forges the "intermediate space," "excluded middle," or "between" that figures so importantly in [[Irigaray]]'s writing".&lt;ref&gt;E. Hirsh, in Burke et al. eds. 1994, 309n&lt;/ref&gt; [[Marion Milner]] claimed that "a temporal spatial frame also marks off the special kind of reality of a psycho-analytic session...the different kind of reality that is within it".&lt;ref&gt;Quoted in Casement 1997, 158.&lt;/ref&gt;

Jungians however have perhaps been most explicit about the 'need to accord space, time and place for liminal feeling'&lt;ref&gt;Shorter 1988, 79.&lt;/ref&gt;—as well about the associated dangers, 'two mistakes: we provide no ritual space at all in our lives...or we stay in it too long'.&lt;ref&gt;Bly, 1991, 194.&lt;/ref&gt; Indeed, Jung's psychology has itself been described as 'a form of "permanent liminality" in which there is no need to return to social structure'.&lt;ref&gt;Homans  1979, 208.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Examples of general usage==
 {{Refimprove section|date=September 2010}}

===In rites===
In the context of rites, liminality is being artificially produced, as opposed to those situations (such as natural disasters) in which it can occur spontaneously.&lt;ref&gt;Thomassen 2009, p. 18&lt;/ref&gt; In the simple example of a college [[graduation]] ceremony, the liminal phase can actually be extended to include the period of time between when the last assignment was finished (and graduation was assured) all the way through reception of the diploma. That [[no man's land]] represents the limbo associated with liminality. The stress of accomplishing tasks for college has been lifted, yet the individual has not moved on to a new stage in life (psychologically or physically). The result is a unique perspective on what has come before, and what may come next.

It can include the period between when a couple get engaged and their marriage or between death and burial, for which cultures may have set ritual observances. Even sexually liberal cultures may strongly disapprove of an engaged spouse having sex with another person during this time. When a marriage proposal is initiated there is a liminal stage between the question and the answer during which the social arrangements of both parties involved are subject to transformation and inversion; a sort of "life stage limbo" so to speak in that the affirmation or denial can result in multiple and diverse outcomes.

Getz&lt;ref&gt;Getz 2007, 179.&lt;/ref&gt; provides commentary on the liminal/liminoid zone when discussing the planned event experience. He refers to a liminal zone at an event as the creation of "time out of time: a special place". He notes that this liminal zone is both spatial and temporal and integral when planning a successful event (e.g. ceremony, concert, conference etc.).&lt;ref&gt;Getz 2007, 442.&lt;/ref&gt;

===In time===
The temporal dimension of liminality can relate to moments (sudden events), periods (weeks, months, or possibly years), and epochs (decades, generations, maybe even centuries).&lt;ref&gt;Thomassen 2009, p. 16&lt;/ref&gt;
====Examples====
[[Twilight]] serves as a liminal time, between day and night—where one is 'in the twilight zone, in a liminal nether region of the night'.&lt;ref&gt;Costello 2002, 158.&lt;/ref&gt;  The title of the television fiction series ''[[The Twilight Zone (1959 TV series)|The Twilight Zone]]'' makes reference to this, describing it as "the middle ground between light and shadow, between science and superstition" in one variant of the original series' opening. The name is from an actual zone observable from space in the place where daylight or shadow advances or retreats about the Earth.  [[Noon]] and, more often, [[midnight]] can be considered liminal, the first transitioning between morning and afternoon, the latter between days.

Within the years, liminal times include [[equinox]]es when day and night have equal length, and [[solstice]]s, when the increase of day or night shifts over to its decrease.  Where the [[quarter days]] are held to mark the change in seasons, they also are liminal times. [[New Year's Day]], whatever its connection or lack of one to the astrological sky, is a liminal time.  Customs such as fortune-telling take advantage of this liminal state.  In a number of cultures, actions and events on the first day of the year can determine the year, leading to such beliefs as [[first-foot]].  Many cultures regard it as a time especially prone to hauntings by [[ghost]]s—[[liminal being]]s, neither alive nor dead.

===In religion===

====Christian worship====

Liminal existence can be located in a separated ''sacred space'', which occupies a ''sacred time''.  Examples in the Bible include the dream of Jacob ([[Book of Genesis|Genesis]] 28:12–19) where he encounters God between heaven and earth and the instance when [[Isaiah]] meets the Lord in the [[temple of holiness]] ([[Book of Isaiah|Isaiah]] 6:1–6).&lt;ref&gt;Carson, 2003, 61.&lt;/ref&gt; In such a liminal space, the individual experiences the revelation of ''sacred knowledge'' where God imparts his knowledge on the person.

Worship can be understood in this context as the church community (or ''communitas'' or ''[[koinonia]]'') enter into liminal space corporately.&lt;ref&gt;Carson 2003, 61.&lt;/ref&gt;  Religious symbols and music may aid in this process described as a [[pilgrimage]] by way of [[prayer]], [[song]], or [[liturgical]] acts.  The congregation is transformed in the liminal space and as they exit, are sent out back into the world to serve.

===Of beings===
Various minority groups can be considered liminal. In reality illegal immigrants (present but not "official"), and stateless people, for example, are regarded as liminal because they are "betwixt and between home and host, part of society, but sometimes never fully integrated".&lt;ref&gt;Thomassen 2009, p. 19&lt;/ref&gt; [[Intersex]] or [[transgender]] people, [[bisexual]] people in most contemporary societies, people of mixed [[ethnicity]], and those accused but not yet judged guilty or not guilty, are liminal. Teenagers, being neither children nor adults, are liminal people: indeed, "for young people, liminality of this kind has become a permanent phenomenon...Postmodern liminality".&lt;ref&gt;Kahane 1997, 31.&lt;/ref&gt; The "[[trickster]] as the mythic projection of the magician—standing in the ''limen'' between the sacred realm and the profane"&lt;ref&gt;Nicholas 2009, 25.&lt;/ref&gt; and related [[archetype]]s embody many such contradictions as do many [[popular culture]] [[celebrities]]. The category could also hypothetically and in [[fiction]] include [[cyborg]]s, [[Hybrid (biology)|hybrids]] between two species, [[shapeshifter]]s. One could also consider seals, crabs, shorebirds, frogs, bats, dolphins/whales and other "border animals" to be liminal: "the wild duck and swan are cases in point...intermediate creatures that combine underwater activity and the bird flight with an intermediate, terrestrial life".&lt;ref&gt;Joseph Henderson in Jung 1978, 153.&lt;/ref&gt; It should come as no surprise that these liminal creatures figure prominently in mythology as shapeshifters and spirit guides.

===In places===
The spatial dimension of liminality can include specific places, larger zones or areas, or entire countries and larger regions.&lt;ref&gt;Thomassen 2009, p. 16&lt;/ref&gt; Liminal places can range from [[border]]s and frontiers to no man's lands and [[disputed territories]], to [[crossroads (culture)|crossroads]] to perhaps [[airport]]s or [[hotel]]s, which people pass through but do not live in: arguably indeed all 'romantic travel enacts the three stages that characterize liminality: separation, marginalization, and reaggregation'.&lt;ref&gt; Illouz 1997, 143.&lt;/ref&gt; In [[mythology]] and [[religion]] or [[occult|esoteric lore]] liminality can include such realms as [[Purgatory]] or [[Da'at (Kabbalah)|Da'at]], which, as well as signifying liminality, some theologians deny actually existing, making them, in some cases, doubly liminal. "Between-ness" defines these spaces. For a hotel worker (an insider) or a person passing by with disinterest (a total outsider), the hotel would have a very different connotation. To a traveller staying there, the hotel would function as a liminal zone, just as 'doors and windows and hallways and gates frame...the definitively liminal condition'.&lt;ref&gt;Richard Brown in Corcoran 2002, 211.&lt;/ref&gt;

More conventionally, springs, caves, shores, rivers, volcanic calderas—'a huge crater of an extinct volcano...[as] another symbol of transcendence'&lt;ref&gt;Joseph Henderson, in Jung 1978, 152.&lt;/ref&gt;—fords, passes, crossroads, bridges, and marshes are all liminal: '"edges", borders or faultlines between the legitimate and the illegitimate'.&lt;ref&gt;Richard Brown in Corcoran 2002, 196&lt;/ref&gt; Oedipus (an adoptee and therefore liminal) met his father at the crossroads and killed him; the bluesman [[Robert Johnson (musician)|Robert Johnson]] met the devil at the crossroads, where he is said to have sold his soul. Major transformations occur at crossroads and other liminal places, at least partly because liminality—being so unstable—can pave the way for access to esoteric knowledge or understanding of both sides.&lt;ref&gt;El Khoury, 2015, 217&lt;/ref&gt; Liminality is sacred, alluring, and dangerous.

In contemporary culture viewing the nightclub experience (dancing in a [[nightclub]]) through the liminoid framework highlights the 'presence or absence of opportunities for social subversion, escape from social structures, and exercising choice'.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Taheri|first=Babak|last2=Gori|first2=Keith|last3=O'Gorman|first3=Kevin|last4=Hogg|first4=Gillian|last5=Farrington|first5=Thomas|date=2016-01-02|title=Experiential liminoid consumption: the case of nightclubbing|journal=Journal of Marketing Management|volume=32|issue=1–2|pages=19–43|doi=10.1080/0267257X.2015.1089309|issn=0267-257X}}&lt;/ref&gt; This allows 'insights into what may be effectively improved in hedonic spaces. Enhancing the consumer experience of these liminoid aspects may heighten experiential feelings of escapism and play, thus encouraging the consumer to more freely consume'.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Taheri|first=Babak|last2=Gori|first2=Keith|last3=O'Gorman|first3=Kevin|last4=Hogg|first4=Gillian|last5=Farrington|first5=Thomas|date=2016-01-02|title=Experiential liminoid consumption: the case of nightclubbing|journal=Journal of Marketing Management|volume=32|issue=1–2|pages=19–43|doi=10.1080/0267257X.2015.1089309|issn=0267-257X}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===In folklore===
There are a number of stories in [[folklore]] of those who could only be killed in a liminal space: [[Lleu Llaw Gyffes|Lleu]] could not be killed during the day or night, nor indoors or outdoors, nor riding or walking, nor clothed or naked (and is attacked at dusk, while wrapped in a net with one foot on a cauldron and one on a goat). Likewise, in [[Hindu]] text [[Bhagavat Purana]], [[Vishnu]] appears in a half-man half-[[lion]] form named [[Narasimha]] to destroy the demon Hiranyakashipu who has obtained the power never to be killed in day nor night, in the ground nor in the air, with [[weapon]] nor by bare hands, in a building nor outside it, by man nor beast.  Narasimha kills Hiranyakashipu at dusk, across his lap, with his sharp claws, on the threshold of the palace, and as Narasimha is a god himself, the demon is killed by neither man nor beast. In the [[Mahabharata]], [[Indra]] promises not to slay [[Namuci]] and [[Vritra]] with anything wet or dry, nor in the day or in the night, but instead kills them at dusk with foam.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia | title=Vritra |encyclopedia=Encyclopedia of Religion |publisher=Macmillan Reference USA/Gale Group |year=2006 |url=http://www.bookrags.com/Vritra |accessdate = 2007-06-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; Yet another example comes from Hayao Miyazaki's "Princess Mononoke" in which the Forest Spirit can only be killed while switching between its two forms.

===In ethnographic research===
In ethnographic research, 'the researcher is...in a liminal state, separated from his own culture yet not incorporated into the host culture'&lt;ref&gt;Norris Johnson, in Robben and Sluka 2007, 76&lt;/ref&gt;—when he or she is both participating in the culture ''and'' observing the culture. The researcher must consider the self in relation to others and his or her positioning in the culture being studied.

In many cases, greater participation in the group being studied can lead to increased access of cultural information and greater in-group understanding of experiences within the culture. However increased participation also blurs the role of the researcher in data collection and analysis. Often a researcher that engages in fieldwork as a "participant" or "participant-observer" occupies a liminal state where he/she is a part of the culture, but also separated from the culture as a researcher. This liminal state of being betwixt and between is emotional and uncomfortable as the researcher uses self-reflexivity to interpret field observations and interviews.

Some scholars argue that ethnographers are present in their research, occupying a liminal state, regardless of their participant status. Justification for this position is that the researcher as a "human instrument" engages with his/her observations in the process of recording and analyzing the data. A researcher, often unconsciously, selects what to observe, how to record observations and how to interpret observations based on personal reference points and experiences. For example, even in selecting what observations are interesting to record, the researcher must interpret and value the data available. To explore the liminal state of the researcher in relation to the culture, self-reflexivity and awareness are important tools to reveal researcher bias and interpretation.

===In popular culture===
====Novels and short stories====

''[[Rant (novel)|Rant: An Oral Biography of Buster Casey]]'' is a US novel by [[Chuck Palahniuk]] from 2007 that makes use of liminality in explaining time travel. ''[[Possession (Byatt novel)|Possession]]'' is  a romance by A. S. Byatt, which describes how [[postmodern]] 'Literary theory. Feminism...write about liminality. Thresholds. Bastions. Fortresses'.&lt;ref&gt;Byatt 1990, 505–06.&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Twilight (novel series)|The Twilight Saga]]'' is a book series by Stephanie Meyer that was turned into film series. Each book title speaks of a liminal period (''[[Twilight (Meyer novel)|Twilight]], [[New Moon (novel)|New Moon]], [[Eclipse (Meyer novel)|Eclipse]]'', and ''[[Breaking Dawn]]''). In the children's story ''[[The Phantom Tollbooth]]'' (1961), Milo enters "The Lands Beyond", a liminal place (which explains its topsy-turvy nature), through a magical tollbooth. When he finishes his quest, he returns, but changed, seeing the world differently. The giver of the tollbooth is never seen and name never known, and hence, also remains liminal. In ''[[Offshore (novel)|Offshore]]'', a British novel by [[Penelope Fitzgerald]], the characters live between sea and land on docked boats, becoming liminal people; as such, liminality is a major theme in the novel. [[Saul Bellow|Bellow]]'s varied uses of liminality...include his ''[[Dangling Man]]'', suspended between civilian life and the armed forces'&lt;ref&gt;Elsbree 1991, 66.&lt;/ref&gt; at 'the onset of the dangling days'.&lt;ref&gt;Bellow 1977, 84.&lt;/ref&gt;

Charlotte Brönte's widely-read ''[[Jane Eyre]]'' follows the protagonist through different stages of life as she crosses the threshold from student to teacher to woman.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Brontë, Charlotte (1816–1855)|volume = 1|date=2017-11-28|publisher=Oxford University Press|series=Oxford Dictionary of National Biography|doi=10.1093/odnb/9780192683120.013.3523}}&lt;/ref&gt; Her existence throughout the novel is liminal and can first be seen when she hides herself behind a large red curtain to read, closing herself off physically and existing in a paracosmic realm. At Gateshead, Jane is noted to be set apart and on the outside of the family, putting her in a liminal space in which she neither belongs nor is completely cast away.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Clark|first=Megan|date=2017|title=The Space In-Between: Exploring Liminality in Jane Eyre|url=|journal=Criterion: A Journal of Literary Criticism|volume=10|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Jane's existence emerges as paradoxical as she transcends commonly accepted beliefs about what it means to be a woman, orphan, child, victim, criminal, and pilgrim&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Gilead|first=Sarah|date=1987|title=Liminality and Antiliminality in Charlotte Brontë's Novels: Shirley Reads Jane Eyre|journal=Texas Studies in Literature and Language|volume=29|issue=3|pages=302–322|jstor=40754831}}&lt;/ref&gt; and creates her own narrative as she is torn from her past and denied a sure future.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Gilead|first=Sarah|date=1987|title=Liminality and Antiliminality in Charlotte Brontë's Novels: Shirley Reads Jane Eyre|journal=Texas Studies in Literature and Language|volume=29|issue=3|pages=302–322|jstor=40754831}}&lt;/ref&gt; Faced with a series of crises, Jane's circumstances question social constructs and allow Jane to act to progress or retract; as a result, a narrative dynamic of structure and liminality (as coined by Turner).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Gilead|first=Sarah|date=1987|title=Liminality and Antiliminality in Charlotte Brontë's Novels: Shirley Reads Jane Eyre|journal=Texas Studies in Literature and Language|volume=29|issue=3|pages=302–322|jstor=40754831}}&lt;/ref&gt;  

Karen Brooks states that Australian [[grunge lit]] books, such as Clare Mendes'  ''[[Drift Street]]'', Edward Berridge's ''[[The Lives of the Saints (fiction)|The Lives of the Saints]]'', and [[Andrew McGahan]]'s ''[[Praise]]'' "...explor[e] the psychosocial and psychosexual limitations of young sub/urban characters in relation to the imaginary and socially constructed boundaries defining...self and other" and "opening up" new "liminal [boundary] spaces" where the concept of an [[abjection|abject]] human body can be explored.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Brooks|first=Karen|year=1998|title=Shit Creek: Suburbia, Abjection and Subjectivity in Australian 'Grunge' Fiction.|url=|journal=Australian Literary Studies|volume=18.4|pages=87–99|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Brooks states that Berridge's short stories provide "...a variety of violent, disaffected and often abject young people", characters who "...blur and often overturn" the boundaries between suburban and urban space.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Brooks|first=Karen|year=1998|title=Shit Creek: Suburbia, Abjection and Subjectivity in Australian 'Grunge' Fiction.|url=|journal=Australian Literary Studies|volume=18.4|pages=87–99|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Brooks states that the marginalized characters in ''The Lives of the Saints'', ''Drift Street'' and ''Praise'') are able to stay in "shit creek" (an undesirable setting or situation) and "diver[t]... flows" of these "creeks", thus claiming their rough settings' "liminality" (being in a border situation or transitional setting) and their own "abjection" (having "abject bodies" with health problems, disease, etc.) as "sites of symbolic empowerment and agency".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Brooks|first=Karen|year=1998|title=Shit Creek: Suburbia, Abjection and Subjectivity in Australian 'Grunge' Fiction.|url=|journal=Australian Literary Studies|volume=18.4|pages=87–99|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
 
Brooks states that the story "Caravan Park" in Berridge's short story collection is an example of a story with a "liminal" setting, as it is set in a [[mobile home]] park; since mobile homes can be relocated, she states that setting a story in a mobile home "...has the potential to disrupt a range of geo-physical and psycho-social boundaries".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Brookes|first=Karen|year=1998|title=Shit Creek: Suburbia, Abjection and Subjectivity in Australian 'Grunge' Fiction.|url=|journal=Australian Literary Studies|volume=18.4|pages=87–99|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Brooks states that in Berridge's story "Bored Teenagers", the adolescents using a community drop-in centre decide to destroy its equipment and defile the space by urinating in it, thus "altering the dynamics of the place and the way" their bodies are perceived, with their destructive activities being deemed by Brooks to indicate the community centre's "loss of authority" over the teens.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Brooks|first=Karen|year=1998|title=Shit Creek: Suburbia, Abjection and Subjectivity in Australian 'Grunge' Fiction.|url=|journal=Australian Literary Studies|volume=18.4|pages=87–99|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Plays====
''[[Rosencrantz and Guildenstern Are Dead]]'', a play by [[Tom Stoppard]], takes place both in a kind of no-man's-land and the actual setting of ''[[Hamlet]]''. "Shakespeare's play ''Hamlet'' is in several ways an essay in sustained liminality ... only via a condition of complete liminality can Hamlet finally see the way forward".&lt;ref&gt;Liebler, pp. 182–84&lt;/ref&gt; In the play ''[[Waiting for Godot]]'' for the entire length of the play, two men walk around restlessly on an empty stage. They alternate between hope and hopelessness.  At times one forgets what they are even waiting for, and the other reminds him: "We are waiting for Godot". The identity of 'Godot' is never revealed, and perhaps the men do not know Godot's identity. The men are trying to keep up their spirits as they wander the empty stage, waiting.

====Films and TV shows====
''[[The Twilight Zone]]'' (1959–2003) is a US television anthology series that explores unusual situations between reality and the paranormal.  ''[[The Terminal (film)|The Terminal]]'' (2004), is a US film in which the main character (Viktor Navorski) is trapped in a liminal space; since he can neither legally return to his home country Krakozhia nor enter the United States, he must remain in the airport terminal indefinitely until he finds a way out at the end of the film. In the film ''[[Waking Life]]'', about dreams, Aklilu Gebrewold talks about liminality.

====Music and other media====
"Liminal Space" is an album by American [[breakcore]] artist Xanopticon. [[Coil (band)|Coil]] mention liminality throughout their works, most explicitly with the title of their song "Batwings (A Limnal Hymn)" ''(sic)'' from their album [[Musick to Play in the Dark Vol. 2]]. In ''[[.hack//Liminality]]'' where Harald Hoerwick, the creator of the MMORPG "The World", attempted to bring the real world into the online world, creating a hazy barrier between the two worlds; a concept called "Liminality".

==Liminoid experiences==
In 1974, Victor Turner coined the term ''liminoid'' (from the greek word eidos, meaning "form or shape"&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|date=2015-01-01|title=Liminality|url=https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/B9780080970868121026|language=en|pages=131–137|doi=10.1016/B978-0-08-097086-8.12102-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;) to refer to experiences that have characteristics of liminal experiences but are optional and do not involve a resolution of a personal crisis.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;Turner, Victor. 'Liminal to liminoid in play, flow, and ritual: An essay in comparative symbology'. ''Rice University Studies'' 1974. 60(3):53–92&lt;/ref&gt;  Unlike liminal events, liminoid experiences are conditional and do not result in a change of status, but merely serve as transitional moments in time&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://scholarship.rice.edu/bitstream/handle/1911/63159/article_RIP603_part4.pdf|title=LIMINAL TO LIMINOID, IN PLAY, FLOW, AND
RITUAL: AN ESSAY IN COMPARATIVE SYMBOLOGY|last=Turner|first=Victor|date=|website=Rice Scholar|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=11/25/18}}&lt;/ref&gt;. The liminal is part of society, an aspect of social or religious rites, while the liminoid is a break from society, part of "play" or "playing". With the rise in industrialization and the emergence of leisure as an acceptable form of play separate from work, liminoid experiences have become much more common than liminal rites.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;  In these modern societies, rites are diminished and 'forged the concept of "liminoid" rituals for analogous but secular phenomena' such as attending rock concerts and other&lt;ref&gt; Illouz, ''Consuming'' p. 142&lt;/ref&gt; liminoid experiences.

The fading of liminal stages in exchange for liminoid experiences is marked by the shift in culture from tribal and agrarian to modern and industrial. In these societies, work and play are entirely separate whereas in more archaic societies, they are nearly indistinguishable.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; In the past play was interwoven with the nature of work as symbolic gestures and rites in order to promote fertility, abundance, and the passage of certain liminal phases; thus, work and play are inseparable and often dependent on social rites&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;. Examples of this include Cherokee and Mayan riddles, trickster tales, sacred ball games, and joking relationships which serve holy purposes of work in liminal situations while retaining the element of playfulness.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

Ritual and myth were, in the past, exclusively connected to collective work that served holy and often symbolic purposes; liminal rites were held in the form of coming-of-age ceremonies, celebrations of seasons, and more. Industrialization cut the cord between work and the sacred, putting "work" and "play" in separate boxes that rarely, if ever, intersected. &lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; In a famous essay regarding the shift to liminal to liminoid in industrial society, Turner offers a twofold explanation of this sect. First, society began to move away from activities concerning collective ritual obligations, placing more emphasis on the individual than the community; this led to more choice in activities, with many such as work and leisure becoming optional. Second, the work done to earn a living became entirely separate from his or her other activities so that it is "no longer natural, but arbitrary."&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; In simpler terms, the industrial revolution brought about free time that had not existed in past societies and created space for liminoid experiences to exist.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

=== Types of Liminoid Experiences ===

==== Sports ====
Sporting events such as the Olympics, NFL football games, and hockey matches are forms of liminoid experiences. They are optional activities of leisure that place both the spectator and the competitor in in-between places outside of society's norms. Sporting events also create a sense of community among fans and reinforces the collective spirit of those who take part.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;id=RIOZwUzy0vsC&amp;oi=fnd&amp;pg=PA127&amp;dq=liminoid&amp;ots=AQGD79gCAS&amp;sig=kfUSHa6p5gBzA_n3vZAnIhIPc9A#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|title=Victor Turner and Contemporary Cultural Performance|last=John|first=Graham St|date=2008-04-01|publisher=Berghahn Books|isbn=9780857450371|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Homecoming football games, gymnastics meets, modern baseball games, and swim meets all qualify as liminoid and follow a seasonal schedule; therefore, the flow of sports becomes cyclical and predictable, reinforcing the liminal qualities.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

==== Flying ====
Airplane travel is inherently liminoid-suspended in the sky, neither here nor there and crossing thresholds of time and space, it is difficult to make sense of the experience of flying.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Murphy|first=Alexandra G.|date=2002-10|title=Organizational Politics of Place and Space: The Perpetual Liminoid Performance of Commercial Flight|url=https://doi.org/10.1080/10462930208616175|journal=Text and Performance Quarterly|language=en|volume=22|issue=4|pages=297–316|doi=10.1080/10462930208616175|issn=1046-2937}}&lt;/ref&gt; Flights shift our existence into a limbo space in which movement becomes an accepted set of cultural performances aimed at convincing us that air travel is a reflection of reality rather than a separation from it.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

As the German army retreated during the later stages of the [[World War II|Second World War]], many of the urban areas of what is now Poland were severely damaged as a result of military action between the retreating forces of the [[Nazi Germany|German]] [[Wehrmacht]] and advancing ones of the [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] [[Red Army]]. Other cities were deliberately destroyed by the German forces.  One of the most famous of these planned destructions was the razing of [[Warsaw]], the [[capital city|capital]] of Poland.&lt;ref name="anthonymtung"&gt;{{cite book | last = Anthony M.

On 17 October 1944, [[Schutzstaffel|SS]] chief [[Heinrich Himmler]] famously stated, "The city must completely disappear from the surface of the earth and serve only as a transport station for the Wehrmacht."&lt;ref name= "Wituska, Tomaszewski p. xxii"&gt;[[#refWituskaTomaszewski2006|Wituska, Tomaszewski 2006]], p. xxii.&lt;/ref&gt;  Before they were stopped by the advancing Red Army, 85% of the city had been taken out.&lt;ref name= "Free Europe Committee p. 10"/&gt;  Warsaw was far from the worst off after the Nazi retreat; 97% of [[Jasło]]&lt;ref name="austriantimes"&gt;{{cite web |date= July 7, 2009|url = http://www.austriantimes.at/news/Panorama/2009-07-07/14509/Polish_town_at_odds_over_Hitler%92s_oak|title = Polish town at odds over Hitler's oak|format = |publisher = Austrian Times| accessdate = October 8, 2009 | last=Lisa Chapman |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and 100% of [[Polanów]] were reduced to rubble.&lt;ref name="PL"/&gt;  Other towns such as [[Wałcz]] fared better, with only a quarter of the city being destroyed.&lt;ref name="PL"/&gt;  Ancient historical buildings in Polish cities were not spared; for example, [[Trzemeszno]]'s [[Romanesque architecture|Romanesque]] [[basilica]] of 1130-45 was burnt down in 1945.&lt;ref name="PL"/&gt;

This page lists common abbreviations for grammatical terms that are used in linguistic [[interlinear gloss]]ing.

Abbreviations beginning with {{sc|n-}} (a common prefix for ''non-'') or ending with {{sc|-z}} (a common suffix for ''-izer'') may not be listed separately. For example, {{nowrap|{{sc|npst}} ''non-past''}} and {{nowrap|{{sc|trz}} ''transitivizer''}} are not listed below, as they are composable from {{nowrap|{{sc|n-}} ''non-''}} + {{nowrap|{{sc|pst}} ''past''}} and {{nowrap|{{sc|tr}} ''transitive''}} + {{nowrap|{{sc|-z}} ''-izer''}}.

Abbreviations are generally written in all caps or—apart from the terms A, S, O and P—in small caps, to distinguish them from lexical words.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5983">The '''Lowry Tapes''' refers to a 2013 scandal in Ireland involving the [[Tipperary North (Dáil constituency)|Tipperary North]] [[Teachta Dála|TD]] [[Michael Lowry]], formerly a [[Fine Gael]] government minister. They feature a telephone conversation between Lowry and the land agent Kevin Phelan. The conversation featured foul language and reference to an undeclared payment of €250,000. It is believed to date from 30 September 2004 and raised uncertainty over whether Lowry had misled the [[Moriarty Tribunal]] which had previously investigated him.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.tv3.ie/article.php?article_id=98152 |archive-url=https://archive.is/20130702082643/http://www.tv3.ie/article.php?article_id=98152 |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2 July 2013 |title=Lowry tape broadcast |work=TV3 News |date=15 March 2013 |accessdate=15 March 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Much of the controversy focused on the following comments by Lowry:&lt;ref name=journal_conversation_aired_on_national_tv/&gt;
{{cquote|I'm asking you, Kevin, for fuck's sake will you protect me just a small bit. For jaysus sake don't land me in it. I'm destroyed as it fucking is. … I can't bring out that 200 – that 250 – again. If that comes out again I'm fucking ruined, I'm bankrupt. … They can't find that 200. I never declared it.}}

{{cquote|Now, the 2500 – the 250 – that I gave you, I paid that directly. I never put that through my books or my account of anything, nobody's going to fucking get it, so I've got, you, know, I mean, I'm not even bringing that into it.}}

Journalist Michael Clifford, writing in the ''[[Irish Examiner]]'', drew comparisons between the response - or lack thereof - from the Irish government and the British government's past responses to tamer crimes such as [[Jeffrey Archer]]'s perjury and [[Chris Huhne]]'s perverting the course of justice. Clifford wrote that the Lowry scandal "tells us much about what passes for democracy in this State. [It] involves ''[[prima facie]]'' evidence that at least one crime may have been committed by serving TD and former government minister, Michael Lowry. In a proper democracy [...] this would be a matter for the police."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=Michael|last=Clifford|url=http://www.irishexaminer.com/opinion/columnists/michael-clifford/lowry-and-inaction-of-gardarevenue-228210.html|title=Lowry and inaction of Garda/Revenue|newspaper=Irish Examiner|date=13 April 2013|accessdate=13 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''[[Sunday Independent (Ireland)|Sunday Independent]]'' published a transcript of the Lowry Tapes; however state broadcaster [[Raidió Teilifís Éireann|RTÉ]]'s coverage was roundly criticised and deemed inadequate. The ''Sunday Independent'' said RTÉ's self-censorship had become the story and ''[[The Sunday Times]]'' featured a piece captioned "Our state broadcaster must learn to confront, not cower."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=Eoghan|last=Harris|url=http://www.independent.ie/opinion/columnists/eoghan-harris/rtes-silence-over-lowry-tapes-is-now-the-story-29150350.html|title=RTÉ's silence over Lowry tapes is now the story|newspaper=Sunday Independent|date=24 March 2013|accessdate=24 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.thejournal.ie/rte-defends-coverage-of-the-lowry-tapes-851924-Mar2013/|title=RTÉ defends coverage of the ‘Lowry Tapes’|work=TheJournal.ie|date=31 March 2013|accessdate=31 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; One of the few mentions was provided by [[Marian Finucane]], one of RTÉ's highest earners, who brushed over the Lowry Tapes in two minutes at the end of her show when one of her panelists brought up the topic.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=Eilis|last=O'Hanlon|url=http://www.independent.ie/opinion/analysis/eilis-ohanlon-you-cant-find-time-to-discuss-lowry-the-public-begs-to-differ-29194820.html|title=You can't find time to discuss Lowry – the public begs to differ|newspaper=Sunday Independent|date=14 April 2013|accessdate=14 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Morning Ireland]]'' preferred to focus its political coverage on what were termed more trivial topics, such as [[Luke 'Ming' Flanagan]]'s driving technique and tweets by [[Gerry Adams]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=John-Paul|last=McCarthy|url=http://www.independent.ie/opinion/analysis/johnpaul-mccarthy-montrose-fails-to-see-value-in-lowry-story-29135186.html|title=Montrose fails to see value in Lowry story: John-Paul McCarthy ponders the passive reaction of both the Government and RTÉ to the Lowry tapes|newspaper=Sunday Independent|date=17 March 2013|accessdate=17 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 14 March 2013, the Lowry Tapes were broadcast in full on national television, on the [[TV3 (Ireland)|TV3]] programme ''[[Tonight with Vincent Browne]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=Jody|last=Corcoran|url=http://www.independent.ie/irish-news/coalition-tension-over-lowry-tapes-29120885.html|title=Coalition tension over Lowry tapes|newspaper=Sunday Independent|date=10 March 2013|accessdate=10 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=journal_conversation_aired_on_national_tv&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.thejournal.ie/michael-lowry-kevin-phelan-conversation-833051-Mar2013/|title=Gardaí examining Lowry tape as conversation is aired on national TV: Independent TD Michael Lowry can be heard making reference to a £250,000 payment which he said he never declared|work=TheJournal.ie|date=15 March 2013|accessdate=15 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 9 May 2013, [[Taoiseach]] [[Enda Kenny]] responded to "real concern" among the public over the Lowry Tapes but said he would not reopen the [[Moriarty Tribunal]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.rte.ie/news/2013/0509/391372-lowry-tapes/|title=Taoiseach rules out reopening Moriarty Tribunal over 'Lowry tapes'|work=RTÉ News|date=9 May 2013|accessdate=9 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Museums, Libraries and Archives Council''' ('''MLA''') was until May 2012 a [[non-departmental public body]] and registered charity in England with a remit to promote improvement and innovation in the area of museums, [[Library|libraries]] and archives. Its functions spanned the UK and it advised the [[UK government|government]] on policy and priorities for these areas in England, receiving funding from the [[Department for Culture, Media and Sport]] (DCMS). The last chairman was Sir [[Andrew Motion]] (lately [[Poet Laureate]]) and last chief executive officer (CEO) was [[Roy Clare]] CBE.

On 26 July 2010 it was announced that the MLA would be abolished under new proposals put forward by the [[Secretary of State for Culture, Olympics, Media and Sport]], [[Jeremy Hunt (politician)|Jeremy Hunt]], to reduce the number of public bodies funded by government. Its functions relating to museums and libraries were transferred on 1 October 2011 to the [[Arts Council England]], and those relating to archives to [[The National Archives (United Kingdom)|The National Archives]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url = http://www.ifacca.org/national_agency_news/2011/10/03/museums-and-libraries-formally-transfer-arts-counc/.| title = Arts Council – Museums and libraries formally transfer to Arts Council England| accessdate = 10 August 2012| deadurl = yes| archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20111125223941/http://ifacca.org/national_agency_news/2011/10/03/museums-and-libraries-formally-transfer-arts-counc/| archivedate = 25 November 2011| df = }}&lt;/ref&gt; Some staff were employed until May 2012 to carry out remaining responsibilities including the appointment of a liquidator.&lt;ref name=transfer&gt;{{cite web|title=Responsibilities transfer|url=http://mla.gov.uk/news_and_views/press_releases/2011/responsibilities_transfer|archive-url=http://webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk/20120215210953/http://mla.gov.uk/news_and_views/press_releases/2011/responsibilities_transfer|dead-url=yes|archive-date=15 February 2012|work=archived MLA website|accessdate=28 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==

The MLA was originally established as the '''Standing Commission on Museums and Galleries''' in 1931.&lt;ref name="national-archives"&gt;[http://www.ndad.nationalarchives.gov.uk/AH/12/detail.html Museum and Galleries Commission], [[The National Archives (United Kingdom)|The National Archives]], UK.&lt;/ref&gt; It was set up following the recommendations of the Final Report of the [[Royal Commission on National Museums and Galleries]], produced in 1929 and 1930. The Standing Commission was renamed the '''Museums and Galleries Commission (MGC)''' in September 1981 and given additional responsibilities. The MGC was a [[registered charity]] and incorporated under a [[Royal Charter#United Kingdom|Royal Charter]] on 1 January 1987. In April 2000, the MGC and the '''Library and Information Commission''' were combined into '''Re:source''' which was later renamed the MLA Council. The MLA was represented in London by MLA London, a separate charity that received core funding from the MLA.

In 2003 the MLA was a stakeholder in the ''Framework for the Future'' report that set out a vision for the future of public libraries in England. In 2008, working with The National Archives, the MLA developed a consultation document on "21st Century Archives". In 2009 the MLA published "Leading Museums" a vision and action plan for museums.

The MLA took over the running of the [[Designation Scheme]], which began in 1997 under the auspices of the Museums and Galleries Commission (MGC). It was expanded in 2005 to include archives and libraries as well as museums that had pre-eminent collections of national or international importance held outside of national institutions. 135 collections had been awarded Designated status by 2011. After the abolition of the MLA the Designation Scheme was taken over by Arts Council England (ACE).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.artscouncil.org.uk/what-we-do/supporting-museums/designation-scheme/about-designation-scheme/.| title = Arts Council – Designation Scheme| accessdate = 10 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Neolithic Revolution''', '''Neolithic Demographic Transition''', '''Agricultural Revolution''', or '''First Agricultural Revolution''' was the wide-scale transition of many [[human culture]]s during the [[Neolithic]] period from a lifestyle of [[hunter-gatherer|hunting and gathering]] to one of [[agriculture]] and [[sedentism|settlement]], making an increasingly larger population possible.&lt;ref name=SCNDR&gt;{{cite journal|title= When the World's Population Took Off: The Springboard of the Neolithic Demographic Transition|journal= Science|date= July 29, 2011|volume= 333|issue= 6042|pages= 560–561|doi= 10.1126/science.1208880|url= http://www.sciencemag.org/content/333/6042/560.full|accessdate= June 10, 2012|author= Jean-Pierre Bocquet-Appel|bibcode = 2011Sci...333..560B|pmid= 21798934 }}&lt;/ref&gt; These settled communities permitted humans to observe and experiment with plants to learn how they grew and developed.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book |title = Worlds together, worlds apart concise edition vol.1 |last = Pollard, Rosenberg, and Tigor |publisher = W.W.

Archaeological data indicates that the [[domestication]] of various types of plants and animals happened in separate locations worldwide, starting in the [[Geologic time scale|geological]] [[Epoch (geology)|epoch]] of the [[Holocene]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.westfalen-blatt.de/nachricht/2012-11-25-klimaschutz-die-ziele-schmelzen-dahin/613/

The Neolithic Revolution greatly narrowed the diversity of foods available, resulting in a downturn in human nutrition.&lt;ref name=Armelagos2014&gt;{{cite journal|last1= Armelagos|first1= George J.|title= Brain Evolution, the Determinates of Food Choice, and the Omnivore's Dilemma|journal= Critical Reviews in Food Science and Nutrition|volume= 54|issue= 10|year= 2014|pages= 1330–1341|issn= 1040-8398|doi= 10.1080/10408398.2011.635817|pmid= 24564590}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Neolithic Revolution involved far more than the adoption of a limited set of food-producing techniques. During the next millennia it would transform the small and mobile groups of hunter-gatherers that had hitherto dominated [[human history|human pre-history]] into [[sedentism|sedentary]] (non-[[nomad]]ic) [[society|societies]] based in built-up villages and towns. These societies radically modified their [[natural environment]] by means of specialized food-crop cultivation, with activities such as [[irrigation]] and [[deforestation]] which allowed the production of surplus food.  Other developments found very widely are the [[domestication of animals]],  [[pottery]], polished stone tools, and rectangular houses.

These developments, sometimes called the '''Neolithic package''', provided the basis for centralized administrations and political structures, hierarchical [[ideology|ideologies]], depersonalized systems of knowledge (e.g. [[history of writing|writing]]), [[population density|densely populated]] settlements, specialization and [[division of labour]], more [[trade]], the development of non-portable [[art]] and [[architecture]], and [[property]] ownership.  The earliest known [[civilization]] developed in [[Sumer]] in southern [[Mesopotamia]] ({{circa|6,500 [[Before Present|BP]]}}); its emergence also heralded the beginning of the [[Bronze Age]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url= http://www.ancient.eu/Neolithic/|title= Neolithic|work= Ancient History Encyclopedia|access-date= 2017-07-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The relationship of the above-mentioned Neolithic characteristics to the onset of agriculture, their sequence of emergence, and empirical relation to each other at various Neolithic sites remains the subject of academic debate, and varies from place to place, rather than being the outcome of universal laws of [[social evolution]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://cas.bellarmine.edu/tietjen/images/neolithic_agriculture.htm "The Slow Birth of Agriculture"] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110101201656/http://cas.bellarmine.edu/tietjen/images/neolithic_agriculture.htm |date=2011-01-01 }}, [[Heather Pringle]]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.mnsu.edu/emuseum/archaeology/sites/middle_east/zawichemishanidar.html |title=Wizard Chemi Shanidar |work=EMuseum |publisher=[[Minnesota State University]] |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080618214404/http://www.mnsu.edu/emuseum/archaeology/sites/middle_east/zawichemishanidar.html |archive-date=June 18, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Levant]] saw the earliest developments of the Neolithic Revolution from around 10,000 BCE, followed by sites in the wider [[Fertile Crescent]].

The term ''Neolithic Revolution'' was coined in 1923 by [[V. Gordon Childe]] to describe the first in a series of agricultural revolutions in [[Middle East]]ern history. The period is described as a "revolution" to denote its importance, and the great significance and degree of change affecting the communities in which new agricultural practices were gradually adopted and refined.

The beginning of this process in different regions has been dated from 10,000 to 8,000 BC in the [[Fertile Crescent]]&lt;ref name=Barker2009 /&gt;&lt;ref name=Thissen2002&gt;Thissen, L. "Appendix I, The CANeW 14C databases, Anatolia 10,000-5000 cal. BC." in: F. Gérard and L. Thissen (eds.), '' The Neolithic of Central Anatolia. Internal developments and external relations during the 9th–6th millennia cal BC'', Proc. Int.  CANeW Round Table, Istanbul 23–24 November 2001, (2002)&lt;/ref&gt; and perhaps 8000 BC in the [[Kuk Swamp|Kuk Early Agricultural Site]] of [[Melanesia]].&lt;ref name="Denham2003"&gt;{{cite journal|last = Denham|first = Tim P.|authorlink =|year = 2003|title = Origins of Agriculture at Kuk Swamp in the Highlands of New Guinea|journal = Science|volume = 301|issue = 5630|pages = 189–193|doi = 10.1126/science.1085255| pmid = 12817084 |author3 = and others|displayauthors = 2|last2 = Haberle|first2 = S.

Recent archaeological research suggests that in some regions such as the Southeast Asian peninsula, the transition from hunter-gatherer to agriculturalist was not linear, but region-specific.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Kealhofer |first=Lisa |title=Looking into the gap: land use and the tropical forests of southern Thailand |journal=Asian Perspectives |date=2003 |volume=42 |issue=1|pages=72–95 |doi=10.1353/asi.2003.0022}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are several competing (but not mutually exclusive) theories as to the factors that drove populations to take up agriculture. The most prominent of these are:
* The Oasis Theory, originally proposed by [[Raphael Pumpelly]] in 1908, popularized by [[V. Gordon Childe]] in 1928 and summarised in Childe's book ''Man Makes Himself''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Man Makes Himself|author=Gordon Childe|year=1936|publisher=Oxford university press}}&lt;/ref&gt; This theory maintains that as the climate got drier due to the Atlantic depressions shifting northward, communities contracted to [[oases]] where they were forced into close association with animals, which were then domesticated together with planting of seeds. However, today this theory has little support amongst archaeologists because subsequent climate data suggests that the region was getting wetter rather than drier.&lt;ref&gt;Scarre, Chris (2005).

London: Thames and Hudson. p. 188. {{ISBN|0500285314}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* The [[Hilly Flanks]] hypothesis, proposed by [[Robert Braidwood]] in 1948, suggests that agriculture began in the hilly flanks of the [[Taurus Mountains|Taurus]] and [[Zagros mountains]], where the climate was not drier as Childe had believed, and fertile land supported a variety of plants and animals amenable to domestication.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Rise of Civilization: From Early Hunters to Urban Society in the Ancient Near East |author=Charles E. Redman |year=1978 |publisher=Freeman |location=San Francisco}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* The Feasting model by Brian Hayden&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Hayden|first=Brian |chapter=Models of Domestication|title=Transitions to Agriculture in Prehistory |editor=Anne Birgitte Gebauer and T. Douglas Price |location=Madison |publisher=Prehistory Press |year=1992 |pages=11–18}}&lt;/ref&gt; suggests that agriculture was driven by ostentatious displays of power, such as giving feasts, to exert dominance. This required assembling large quantities of food, which drove agricultural technology.
* The Demographic theories proposed by [[Carl Sauer]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Sauer |first=Carl O. |year=1952|title=Agricultural origins and dispersals|location=Cambridge, MA|publisher=MIT Press}}&lt;/ref&gt; and adapted by [[Lewis Binford]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Binford |first=Lewis R. |year=1968 |chapter=Post-Pleistocene Adaptations |title=New Perspectives in Archaeology |editor=Sally R. Binford and Lewis R. Binford |publisher=Aldine Publishing Company |location=Chicago |pages=313–342}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Kent Flannery]] posit an increasingly sedentary population that expanded up to the carrying capacity of the local environment and required more food than could be gathered. Various social and economic factors helped drive the need for food.
* The evolutionary/intentionality theory, developed by [[David Rindos]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Origins of Agriculture: An Evolutionary Perspective|first=David|last=Rindos|publisher=Academic Press|date=December 1987|isbn=978-0125892810}}&lt;/ref&gt; and others, views agriculture as an evolutionary adaptation of plants and humans. Starting with domestication by protection of wild plants, it led to specialization of location and then full-fledged domestication.
* [[Peter Richerson]], [[Robert Boyd (anthropologist)|Robert Boyd]], and [[Robert Bettinger]]&lt;ref name="Richersonetal2001"&gt;{{cite journal|last = Richerson|first = Peter J.|authorlink =|year = 2001|title = Was Agriculture Impossible during the Pleistocene but Mandatory during the Holocene?|journal = American Antiquity|volume = 66|issue = 3|pages = 387–411|doi = 10.2307/2694241|displayauthors = etal |jstor = 2694241|last2 = Boyd|first2 = Robert}}&lt;/ref&gt; make a case for the development of agriculture coinciding with an increasingly stable climate at the beginning of the [[Holocene]]. [[Ronald Wright]]'s book and Massey Lecture Series ''[[A Short History of Progress]]''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=A Short History of Progress|first=Ronald|last=Wright|publisher=Anansi|year=2004|isbn=978-0887847066}}&lt;/ref&gt; popularized this hypothesis.
* The postulated [[Younger Dryas event|Younger Dryas impact event]], claimed to be in part responsible for [[Quaternary extinction event|megafauna extinction]] and ending the last [[glacial period]], could have provided circumstances that required the evolution of agricultural societies for humanity to survive.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Anderson|first=David G|author2=Albert C. Goodyear |author3=James Kennett |author4=Allen West |title=Multiple lines of evidence for possible Human population decline/settlement reorganization during the early Younger Dryas|journal=Quaternary International|date=2011|volume=242|issue=2|pages=570–583|doi=10.1016/j.quaint.2011.04.020|bibcode=2011QuInt.242..570A}}&lt;/ref&gt; The agrarian revolution itself is a reflection of typical overpopulation by certain species following initial events during extinction eras; this overpopulation itself ultimately propagates the extinction event.
* [[Leonid Grinin]] argues that whatever plants were cultivated, the independent invention of agriculture always took place in special natural environments (e.g., South-East Asia). It is supposed that the cultivation of cereals started somewhere in the Near East: in the hills of Palestine or Egypt. So Grinin dates the beginning of the agricultural revolution within the interval 12,000 to 9,000 BP, though in some cases the first cultivated plants or domesticated animals' bones are even of a more ancient age of 14–15 thousand years ago.&lt;ref&gt;Grinin L.E.

Volume 6, Number 2 / September 2007 [http://www.socionauki.ru/journal/articles/129510/]&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Andrew M. T. Moore|Andrew Moore]] suggested that the Neolithic Revolution originated over long periods of development in the [[Levant]], possibly beginning during the [[Epipaleolithic]]. In ''"A Reassessment of the Neolithic Revolution"'', [[Frank Hole]] further expanded the relationship between plant and [[animal domestication]]. He suggested the events could have occurred independently over different periods of time, in as yet unexplored locations. He noted that no transition site had been found documenting the shift from what he termed immediate and delayed return social systems. He noted that the full range of domesticated animals ([[goat]]s, [[sheep]], [[cattle]] and [[pigs]]) were not found until the sixth millennium at [[Tell Ramad]]. Hole concluded that ''"close attention should be paid in future investigations to the western margins of the [[Euphrates]] basin, perhaps as far south as the [[Arabian Peninsula]], especially where [[wadi]]s carrying Pleistocene rainfall runoff flowed."''&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.persee.fr/web/revues/home/prescript/article/paleo_0153-9345_1984_num_10_2_939 Hole, Frank., A Reassessment of the Neolithic Revolution, Paléorient, Volume 10, Issue 10-2, pp. 49-60, 1984.]&lt;/ref&gt;

Once agriculture started gaining momentum, around 9000 BC, human activity resulted in the [[selective breeding]] of cereal grasses (beginning with [[emmer]], [[einkorn]] and [[barley]]), and not simply of those that would favour greater caloric returns through larger seeds. Plants with traits such as small seeds or bitter taste would have been seen as undesirable. Plants that rapidly shed their seeds on maturity tended not to be gathered at harvest, therefore not stored and not seeded the following season; years of harvesting selected for strains that retained their edible seeds longer.

Several plant species, the "pioneer crops" or [[Neolithic founder crops]], were identified by [[Daniel Zohary]], who highlighted the importance of the three [[cereal]]s, and suggested that domestication of [[flax]], [[pea]]s, [[chickpea]]s, [[Vicia ervilia|bitter vetch]] and [[lentil]]s came a little later. Based on analysis of the [[gene]]s of domesticated plants, he preferred theories of a single, or at most a very small number of domestication events for each [[taxon]] that spread in an arc from the [[Levantine corridor]] around the [[Fertile Crescent]] and later into Europe.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=ZRi1AAAAIAAJ&amp;q=The+Origins+and+Spread+of+Agriculture+and+Pastoralism+in+Eurasia&amp;dq=The+Origins+and+Spread+of+Agriculture+and+Pastoralism+in+Eurasia&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=jSDLeRcJNI&amp;sig=V8u7my28ypj_bN_lBNIYmGc_HX8&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=cvUqUIbjFOmf0QXxp4GgCQ&amp;redir_esc=y Zohary, D., The mode of domestication of the founder crops of Southwest Asian agriculture. pp. 142-158 in D.

Monographie du CRA 6, Éditions Centre Nationale Recherches Scientifiques: Paris, 1992&lt;/ref&gt; Some of these pioneering attempts failed at first and crops were abandoned, sometimes to be taken up again and successfully domesticated thousands of years later: [[rye]], tried and abandoned in Neolithic [[Anatolia]], made its way to Europe as weed seeds and was successfully domesticated in Europe, thousands of years after the earliest agriculture.&lt;ref name="Weiss2006"&gt;{{cite journal | last = Weiss | first = Ehud | authorlink = | author2 = Kislev, Mordechai E.; Hartmann, Anat | year = 2006 | title = Autonomous Cultivation Before Domestication | journal = [[Science (journal)|Science]] | volume = 312 | issue = 5780 | pages = 1608–1610 | doi = 10.1126/science.1127235 | url =| pmid = 16778044 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Wild lentils presented a different problem: most of the wild seeds do not germinate in the first year; the first evidence of lentil domestication, breaking dormancy in their first year, was found in the early Neolithic at [[Jerf el Ahmar]] (in modern Syria), and quickly spread south to the [[Netiv HaGdud]] site in the [[Jordan Valley (Middle East)|Jordan Valley]].&lt;ref name="Weiss2006" /&gt; This process of domestication allowed the founder crops to adapt and eventually become larger, more easily harvested, more dependable{{clarify|date=November 2016}} in storage and more useful to the human population.

Selectively propagated [[ficus|figs]], wild barley and wild oats were cultivated at the early Neolithic site of [[Gilgal I]], where in 2006&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2006/06/060602074522.htm|title=Tamed 11,400 Years Ago, Figs Were Likely First Domesticated Crop}}&lt;/ref&gt; archaeologists found caches of seeds of each in quantities too large to be accounted for even by [[intensive gathering]], at strata datable to c. 11,000 years ago. Some of the plants tried and then abandoned during the Neolithic period in the Ancient Near East, at sites like Gilgal, were later successfully domesticated in other parts of the world.

Once early farmers perfected their agricultural techniques like irrigation, their crops would [[Crop yield|yield]] surpluses that needed storage. Most hunter gatherers could not easily store food for long due to their migratory lifestyle, whereas those with a sedentary dwelling could store their surplus grain. Eventually [[granary|granaries]] were developed that allowed villages to store their seeds longer. So with more food, the population expanded and communities developed specialized workers and more advanced tools.

The process was not as linear as was once thought, but a more complicated effort, which was undertaken by different human populations in different regions in many different ways.

===In the Fertile Crescent===

Early agriculture is believed to have originated and become widespread in Southwest [[Asia]] around 10,000–9,000 BP, though earlier individual sites have been identified. The [[Fertile Crescent]] region of Southwest Asia is the centre of domestication for three cereals (einkorn wheat, emmer wheat and barley), four legumes (lentil, pea, bitter vetch and chickpea), and flax. Domestication was a slow process involving multiple sites for each crop.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1=Brown | first1=T. A. | last2=Jones | first2=M.

===In Africa===
[[File:Nile-River1.ogv|thumb|right|Nile River Valley, Egypt]]

On the African continent, three areas have been identified as independently developing agriculture: the [[Ethiopian Highlands|Ethiopian highlands]], the [[Sahel]] and [[West Africa]].&lt;ref name="diamond"&gt;{{cite book |last=Diamond|first= Jared|authorlink=Jared Diamond| year=1999|title=Guns, Germs, and Steel|publisher= New York: Norton Press|isbn= 978-0393317558|title-link= Guns, Germs, and Steel}}&lt;/ref&gt; By contrast,   [[Agriculture in Egypt|Agriculture in the Nile River Valley]] is thought to have developed from the original Neolithic Revolution in the [[Fertile Crescent]]. 
Many grinding stones are found with the early Egyptian [[Sebilian]] and [[Mechian]] cultures and evidence has been found of a neolithic domesticated crop-based economy dating around 7,000 BP.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=JAca1F3qG34C&amp;pg=PA70&amp;lpg=PA70&amp;dq=Africa,+neolithic&amp;source=web&amp;ots=wWVGAvbwDC&amp;sig=oLsfZADAq2fplcionxe5hXjBgXw&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=V8GKSaSbO9eitge6-eibBw&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;resnum=10&amp;ct=result#PPA76,M1 The Cambridge History of Africa]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="smith"&gt;Smith, Philip E.L., Stone Age Man on the Nile, Scientific American Vol. 235 No. 2, August 1976: "With the benefit of hindsight we can now see that many Late Paleolithic peoples in the Old World were poised on the brink of plant cultivation and animal husbandry as an alternative to the hunter-gatherer's way of life".&lt;/ref&gt;
Unlike the Middle East, this evidence appears as a "false dawn" to agriculture, as the sites were later abandoned, and permanent farming then was delayed until 6,500 BP with the [[Tasian]] and [[Badarian]] cultures and the arrival of crops and animals from the Near East.

[[Bananas]] and [[Plantain (cooking)|plantains]], which were first domesticated in [[Southeast Asia]], most likely [[Papua New Guinea]], were re-domesticated in Africa possibly as early as 5,000 years ago. Asian yams and [[taro]] were also cultivated in Africa.&lt;ref name="diamond"/&gt;

The most famous crop domesticated in the Ethiopian highlands is [[coffee]]. In addition, [[khat]], [[ensete]], [[noog]], [[teff]] and [[finger millet]] were also domesticated in the Ethiopian highlands. Crops domesticated in the Sahel region include [[sorghum]] and [[pearl millet]]. The [[kola nut]] was first domesticated in West Africa. Other crops domesticated in West Africa include [[African rice]], [[Yam (vegetable)|yams]] and the [[oil palm]].&lt;ref name="diamond"/&gt;

Agriculture spread to Central and Southern Africa in the [[Bantu expansion]] during the 1st millennium BC to 1st millennium AD.

===In the Americas===
{{further|New World Crops|Ancient Pueblo Peoples|Oasisamerica|Proto-Uto-Aztecan}}

[[Maize]] (corn), [[beans]] and [[Squash (plant)|squash]] were among the earliest crops domesticated in [[Mesoamerica]], with maize beginning about 4000 BC,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |editor1=Johannessen, S. |editor2=Hastorf, C. A. |title=Corn and Culture in the Prehistoric New World |publisher=Westview Press}}&lt;/ref&gt; squash as early as 6000 BC, and beans by no later than 4000 BC. [[Potatoes]] and [[manioc]] were domesticated in [[South America]]. In what is now the eastern United States, Native Americans domesticated [[sunflower]], [[sumpweed]] and [[goosefoot]] around 2500 BC. Sedentary village life based on farming did not develop until the second millennium BC, referred to as the formative period.&lt;ref name="Barker2009p252"&gt;{{cite book|author=Graeme Barker|title=The Agricultural Revolution in Prehistory: Why Did Foragers Become Farmers?|page=  252|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=fkifXu2gx4YC|accessdate=4 January 2012|year=2009|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0199559954}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===In New Guinea===
Evidence of drainage ditches at [[Kuk Swamp]] on the borders of the [[Western Highlands Province|Western]] and [[Southern Highlands Province|Southern Highlands]] of [[Papua New Guinea]] shows evidence of the cultivation of [[taro]] and a variety of other crops, dating back to 11,000 BP. Two potentially significant economic species, taro (''[[Colocasia esculenta]]'') and [[yam (vegetable)|yam]] (''[[Dioscorea]]'' sp.), have been identified dating at least to 10,200 calibrated years before present (cal BP). Further evidence of [[banana]]s and [[sugarcane]] dates to 6,950 to 6,440 BP. This was at the altitudinal limits of these crops, and it has been suggested that cultivation in more favourable ranges in the lowlands may have been even earlier. [[Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation|CSIRO]] has found evidence that taro was introduced into the [[Solomon Islands (archipelago)|Solomon Islands]] for human use, from 28,000 years ago, making taro cultivation the earliest crop in the world.&lt;ref&gt;Denham, Tim et al. (received July 2005) "Early and mid Holocene tool-use and processing of taro (''Colocasia esculenta''), yam (''Dioscorea'' sp.) and other plants at Kuk Swamp in the highlands of Papua New Guinea" (Journal of Archaeological Science, Volume 33, Issue 5, May 2006)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Hoy, Thomas &amp; Matthew Springs (1992), " Direct evidence for human use of plants 28,000 years ago: starch residues on stone artefacts from the northern Solomon Islands" (Antiquity  Volume: 66,  Number: 253, pp. 898–912)&lt;/ref&gt;  It seems to have resulted in the spread of the [[Trans–New Guinea languages]] from New Guinea east into the Solomon Islands and west into [[Timor]] and adjacent areas of [[Indonesia]]. This seems to confirm the theories of [[Carl O. Sauer|Carl Sauer]] who, in "Agricultural Origins and Dispersals", suggested as early as 1952 that this region was a centre of early agriculture.

==Domestication of animals==
{{Further|Domestication of animals}}
When hunter-gathering began to be replaced by sedentary food production it became more profitable to keep animals close at hand.{{citation needed|date=November 2016}} Therefore, it became necessary to bring animals permanently to their settlements, although in many cases there was a distinction between relatively sedentary farmers and nomadic herders.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://genographic.nationalgeographic.com/development-of-agriculture/|title=The Development of Agriculture|work=Genographic Project|access-date=2017-07-21|language=en-US|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160414142437/https://genographic.nationalgeographic.com/development-of-agriculture/|archivedate=2016-04-14|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{original research inline|date=November 2016}} The animals' size, temperament, diet, mating patterns, and life span were factors in the desire and success in domesticating animals. Animals that provided milk, such as cows and goats, offered a source of protein that was renewable and therefore quite valuable. The animal’s ability as a worker (for example ploughing or towing), as well as a food source, also had to be taken into account. Besides being a direct source of food, certain animals could provide leather, wool, hides, and fertilizer. Some of the earliest domesticated animals included dogs ([[East Asia]], about 15,000 years ago),&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news

===Domestication of animals in the Middle East===
[[File:Menare.jpg|Dromedary caravan in Algeria|thumb|right]]

The Middle East served as the source for many animals that could be domesticated, such as sheep, goats and pigs. This area was also the first region to [[domesticate]] the [[dromedary]]. [[Henri Fleisch]] discovered and termed the [[Shepherd Neolithic]] [[flint]] industry from the [[Bekaa Valley]] in [[Lebanon]] and suggested that it could have been used by the earliest [[nomad]]ic [[shepherd]]s. He dated this industry to the [[Epipaleolithic]] or [[Pre-Pottery Neolithic]] as it is evidently not [[Paleolithic]], [[Mesolithic]] or even [[Pottery]] [[Neolithic]].&lt;ref name="CopelandWescombe1966"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Fleisch, Henri., Notes de Préhistoire Libanaise : 1) Ard es Saoude. 2) La Bekaa Nord. 3) Un polissoir en plein air. BSPF, vol. 63.&lt;/ref&gt; The presence of these animals gave the region a large advantage in cultural and economic development. As the climate in the Middle East changed and became drier, many of the farmers were forced to leave, taking their domesticated animals with them. It was this massive emigration from the Middle East that would later help distribute these animals to the rest of [[Afroeurasia]]. This emigration was mainly on an east-west axis of similar climates, as crops usually have a narrow optimal climatic range outside of which they cannot grow for reasons of light or rain changes. For instance, wheat does not normally grow in tropical climates, just like tropical crops such as bananas do not grow in colder climates. Some authors, like [[Jared Diamond]], have postulated that this East-West axis is the main reason why plant and animal domestication spread so quickly from the [[Fertile Crescent]] to the rest of Eurasia and North Africa, while it did not reach through the North-South axis of [[Africa]] to reach the Mediterranean climates of [[South Africa]], where temperate crops were successfully imported by ships in the last 500 years.&lt;ref&gt;''[[Guns, Germs, and Steel]]: The Fates of Human Societies''. [[Jared Diamond]] (1997).&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, the African [[Zebu]] of central Africa and the domesticated bovines of the fertile-crescent — separated by the dry sahara desert — were not introduced into each other's region.

==Consequences==

===Social change===
[[File:World population growth (lin-log scale).png|thumb|left|320px|World population (estimated) did not rise for a few millennia after the Neolithic revolution.]]

Despite the significant technological advance, the Neolithic revolution did not lead immediately to a rapid growth of population. Its benefits appear to have been offset by various adverse effects,
mostly diseases and warfare.&lt;ref&gt;[[James C. Scott]],''Against the Grain: a Deep History of the Earliest States'', NJ:Yale UP, (2017), "The world's population in 10 000 BC, according to a careful estimate was roughly 4 million. A full five thousand years later it has risen only to 5 million...One likely explanation for this apparent human progress in subsistance techniques together with a long period of demographic stagnation is that epidemologically this was perhaps the most lethal period in human history".&lt;/ref&gt;

The introduction of agriculture has not necessarily led to unequivocal progress. The nutritional standards of the growing Neolithic populations were inferior to that of hunter-gatherers. Several ethnological and archaeological studies conclude that the transition to cereal-based diets caused a reduction in life expectancy and stature, an increase in infant mortality and infectious diseases, the development of chronic, inflammatory or degenerative diseases (such as obesity, type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular diseases) and multiple nutritional deficiencies, including vitamin deficiencies, iron deficiency anemia and mineral disorders affecting bones (such as osteoporosis and rickets) and teeth.&lt;ref name="SandsMorris2009"&gt;{{cite journal| vauthors=Sands DC, Morris CE, Dratz EA, Pilgeram A| title=Elevating optimal human nutrition to a central goal of plant breeding and production of plant-based foods. | journal=Plant Sci | year= 2009 | volume= 177 | issue= 5 | pages= 377–389 | pmid=20467463 | doi=10.1016/j.plantsci.2009.07.011 | pmc=2866137 |  type=Review }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="OKeefeCordain2004"&gt;{{cite journal| vauthors=O'Keefe JH, Cordain L| title=Cardiovascular disease resulting from a diet and lifestyle at odds with our Paleolithic genome: how to become a 21st-century hunter-gatherer. | journal=Mayo Clin Proc | year= 2004 | volume= 79 | issue= 1 | pages= 101–108 | pmid=14708953 | doi=10.4065/79.1.101 | type=Review }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Shermer, Michael 2001 p.250"&gt;{{cite book |author=Shermer, Michael |authorlink=Michael Shermer |year=2001 |title=The Borderlands of Science |publisher=Oxford University Press |page=250}}&lt;/ref&gt; Average height went down from 5'10" (178&amp;nbsp;cm) for men and 5'6" (168&amp;nbsp;cm) for women to 5'5" (165&amp;nbsp;cm) and 5'1" (155&amp;nbsp;cm), respectively, and it took until the twentieth century for average human height to come back to the pre-Neolithic Revolution levels.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last=Hermanussen | first=Michael | last2=Poustka | first2=Fritz | title=Stature of early Europeans | journal=Hormones (Athens) | volume=2 | issue=3 | pages=175–178 |date=July–September 2003 | pmid=17003019 | doi=10.1159/000079404 | url=http://hormones.gr/preview.php?c_id=127}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The traditional view is that agricultural food production supported a denser population, which in turn supported larger sedentary communities, the accumulation of goods and tools, and specialization in diverse forms of new labor. The development of larger societies led to the development of different means of decision making and to governmental organization. Food surpluses made possible the development of a social elite who were not otherwise engaged in agriculture, industry or commerce, but dominated their communities by other means and monopolized decision-making.&lt;ref name="Eagly99"&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Eagly, Alice H. |author2=Wood, Wendy |title=The Origins of Sex Differences in Human Behavior: Evolved Dispositions Versus Social Roles |journal=American Psychologist |volume=54 |issue=6 |date=June 1999 |pages=408–423 |url=http://www.sscnet.ucla.edu/anthro/faculty/fiske/facets/eagly&amp;wood.htm |doi=10.1037/0003-066x.54.6.408}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Jared Diamond]] (in [[The World Until Yesterday]]) identifies the availability of milk and cereal grains as permitting mothers to raise both an older (e.g. 3 or 4 year old) and a younger child concurrently. The result is that a population can increase more rapidly. Diamond, in agreement with feminist scholars such as [[V. Spike Peterson]], points out that agriculture brought about deep social divisions and encouraged [[gender inequality]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Diamond, Jared |authorlink=Jared Diamond |url=http://discovermagazine.com/1987/may/02-the-worst-mistake-in-the-history-of-the-human-race  |title=The Worst Mistake in the History of the Human Race |journal=Discover Magazine |date=May 1987 |pages=64–66}}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Peterson|first=V.

===Subsequent revolutions===
[[File:Egyptian Domesticated Animals.jpg|thumb|Domesticated cow being milked in [[Ancient Egypt]]]]

[[Andrew Sherratt]] has argued that following upon the Neolithic Revolution was a second phase of discovery that he refers to as the [[secondary products revolution]]. Animals, it appears, were first domesticated purely as a source of meat.&lt;ref name="Sherratt 1981"&gt;Sherratt 1981&lt;/ref&gt; The Secondary Products Revolution occurred when it was recognised that animals also provided a number of other useful products. These included:
* [[History of hide materials|hides and skins (from undomesticated animals)]]
* [[manure]] for soil conditioning (from all domesticated animals)
* [[wool]] (from sheep, llamas, alpacas, and [[Angora goat]]s)
* [[milk]] (from goats, cattle, yaks, sheep, horses and camels)
* [[Working animal|traction]] (from oxen, [[onagers]], donkeys, horses, camels and dogs)
* guarding and herding assistance (dogs)

Sherratt argued that this phase in agricultural development enabled humans to make use of the energy possibilities of their animals in new ways, and permitted permanent intensive subsistence farming and crop production, and the opening up of heavier soils for farming. It also made possible [[nomadic pastoralism]] in semi arid areas, along the margins of deserts, and eventually led to the domestication of both the [[dromedary]] and [[Bactrian camel]].&lt;ref name="Sherratt 1981"/&gt; Overgrazing of these areas, particularly by herds of goats, greatly extended the areal extent of deserts.

Living in one spot would have more easily permitted the accrual of personal possessions and an attachment to certain areas of land. From such a position, it is argued{{by whom|date=May 2015}}, prehistoric people were able to stockpile food to survive lean times and trade unwanted surpluses with others. Once [[trade]] and a secure food supply were established, populations could grow, and society would have diversified into food producers and artisans, who could afford to develop their trade by virtue of the free time they enjoyed because of a surplus of food. The artisans, in turn, were able to develop technology such as metal weapons. Such relative complexity would have required some form of social organisation to work efficiently, so it is likely that populations that had such organisation, perhaps such as that provided by religion, were better prepared and more successful. In addition, the denser populations could form and support legions of professional soldiers. Also, during this time property ownership became increasingly important to all people. Ultimately, Childe argued that this growing social complexity, all rooted in the original decision to settle, led to a second [[Urban Revolution]] in which the first cities were built.{{Citation needed|date=November 2008}}

===Disease===

Throughout the development of sedentary societies, disease spread more rapidly than it had during the time in which hunter-gatherer societies existed. Inadequate sanitary practices and the domestication of animals may explain the rise in deaths and sickness following the Neolithic Revolution, as diseases jumped from the animal to the human population. Some examples of [[infectious diseases]] spread from animals to humans are [[influenza]], [[smallpox]], and [[measles]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1=Furuse | first1=Y. | last2=Suzuki | first2=A. | last3=Oshitani | first3=H. | title=Origin of measles virus: Divergence from rinderpest virus between the 11th and 12th centuries | doi=10.1186/1743-422X-7-52 | journal=Virology Journal | volume=7 | page=52 | year=2010 | pmc=2838858 | pmid=20202190}}&lt;/ref&gt; In concordance with a process of [[natural selection]], the humans who first domesticated the big [[mammals]] quickly built up immunities to the diseases as within each generation the individuals with better immunities had better chances of survival. In their approximately 10,000 years of shared proximity with animals, such as cows, Eurasians and Africans became more resistant to those diseases compared with the indigenous populations encountered outside [[Eurasia]] and [[Africa]].&lt;ref&gt;''[[Guns, Germs, and Steel|Guns, Germs, and Steel: The Fates of Human Societies]]''.  [[Jared Diamond]], 1997&lt;/ref&gt; For instance, the population of most [[Caribbean]] and several [[Pacific Islands]] have been completely wiped out by diseases. 90% or more of many populations of the Americas were [[Population history of American indigenous peoples|wiped out by European and African diseases]] before recorded contact with European explorers or colonists. Some cultures like the [[Inca Empire]] did have a large domestic mammal, the [[llama]], but llama milk was not drunk, nor did llamas live in a closed space with humans, so the risk of contagion was limited. According to bioarchaeological research, the effects of agriculture on physical and dental health in Southeast Asian rice farming societies from 4000 to 1500 B.P. was not detrimental to the same extent as in other world regions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Halcrow |first=S. |author2=E., Harris, N.

===Technology===

In his book ''[[Guns, Germs, and Steel]]'', [[Jared Diamond]] argues that Europeans and East Asians benefited from an advantageous geographical location that afforded them a head start in the Neolithic Revolution. Both shared the temperate climate ideal for the first agricultural settings, both were near a number of easily [[domestication|domesticable]] plant and animal species, and both were safer from attacks of other people than civilizations in the middle part of the Eurasian continent. Being among the first to adopt agriculture and sedentary lifestyles, and neighboring other early agricultural societies with whom they could compete and trade, both Europeans and East Asians were also among the first to benefit from technologies such as [[firearm]]s and steel [[sword]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/history/ancient/british_prehistory/overview_british_prehistory_01.shtml|title=BBC – History – Ancient History in depth: Overview: From Neolithic to Bronze Age, 8000–800 BC|access-date=2017-07-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;!--During and after the [[Age of Discovery]], European explorers, such as the Spanish [[conquistador]]s, encountered other groups of people who had never or only recently adopted agriculture. (SO WHAT?)--&gt;

==Archaeogenetics==
The dispersal of Neolithic culture from the Middle East has recently been associated with the distribution of human genetic markers. In Europe, the spread of the Neolithic culture has been associated with distribution of the [[E1b1b]] lineages and [[Haplogroup J (Y-DNA)|Haplogroup J]] that are thought to have arrived in Europe from North Africa and the Near East respectively.&lt;ref name="semino2004"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Semino|year=2004|title=Origin, Diffusion, and Differentiation of Y-Chromosome Haplogroups E and J: Inferences on the Neolithization of Europe and Later Migratory Events in the Mediterranean Area|pmid=15069642|first1=O|last2=Magri|first2=C|last3=Benuzzi|first3=G|last4=Lin|first4=AA|last5=Al-Zahery|first5=N|last6=Battaglia|first6=V|last7=MacCioni|first7=L|last8=Triantaphyllidis|first8=C|last9=Shen|first9=P|volume=74|issue=5|pages=1023–34|doi=10.1086/386295|pmc=1181965|journal=American Journal of Human Genetics|displayauthors=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="lancaster"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Lancaster|first=Andrew|year=2009|url=http://www.jogg.info/51/files/Lancaster.pdf|journal=Journal of Genetic Genealogy|volume=5|issue=1|title=Y Haplogroups, Archaeological Cultures and Language Families: a Review of the Multidisciplinary Comparisons using the case of E-M35}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Africa, the spread of farming, and notably the [[Bantu expansion]], is associated with the dispersal of Y-chromosome haplogroup [[E1b1a]] from West Africa.&lt;ref name="semino2004"/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1516">'''''Northern History''''' is an [[academic journal]] of the history of the northern counties of England. It was first published in 1966 under the auspices of the School of History, [[University of Leeds]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.history.ac.uk/history-online/journal/northern-history|title=Northern History - History On-line|website=History.ac.uk|accessdate=4 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is indexed by [[Scopus]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tandfonline.com/toc/ynhi20/current|title=Northern History: Vol 54, No 2|website=Tandfonline.com|accessdate=4 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;. The journal's founding Editor was G.C.F. Forster and he retired from the journal after the publication of issue 53.2. In 1997, S.J.D. Green (Professor of Modern History at the University of Leeds) joined as co-editor. In 2016, the Editorial team changed to: S.J.D. Green, Julia Barrow FBA (Professor in Medieval Studies) and Stephen Alford (Professor of Early Modern British History). The journal is currently published by Routledge. 

The journal's purpose is to publish scholarly work on the history of the seven historic Northern counties of England: Cheshire, Cumberland, Durham, Lancashire, Northumberland, Westmorland and Yorkshire. Since it was launched it has always been a refereed journal, attracting articles on Northern subjects from historians in many parts of the world.

The program was originally reported to be designed to monitor for, as well as neutralize and counter, [[cyberattack]]s against government agencies and private companies in critical parts of the U.S. private sector including defense, power plants, transportation, and major internet firms.&lt;ref name="cn1"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.cnet.com/8301-1009_3-20009952-83.html|title=Report: NSA initiating program to detect cyberattacks |last=Whitney|first=Lance|date=July 8, 2010&lt;!-- 7:06 AM PDT--&gt;|work=[[CNET.com]]|accessdate=8 July 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="dt1" /&gt; The program is the successor to a previous surveillance project called "April Strawberry".&lt;ref name="dt1"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.dailytech.com/NSAs+Perfect+Citizen+Program++Big+Brother+or+Cybersecurity+Savior/article18969.htm|title=DailyTech - NSA's "Perfect Citizen" Program:  Big Brother or Cybersecurity Savior?|last=Mick|first=Jason|date=July 8, 2010&lt;!-- 10:17 AM--&gt;|publisher=DailyTech|accessdate=8 July 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The project is still in an early stage, "but NSA officials have reportedly met with utility executives and politely asked them to cooperate with the surveillance."&lt;ref name="dt1" /&gt; Although participation is still voluntary, the government has offered incentives such as additional contracts to those who comply.&lt;ref name="cn1" /&gt;&lt;ref name="dt1" /&gt;

==Controversy==
The program, which is described by critics as "[[Big Brother (Nineteen Eighty-Four)|Big Brother]]",  has raised privacy concerns as well as concerns over government intervention in the private sector.&lt;ref name="dt1" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.cnet.com/8301-13578_3-10462563-38.html|title=White House outlines secret cybersecurity plan |last=McCullagh|first=Declan|date=March 2, 2010|work=[[CNET.com]]|accessdate=8 July 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Archaeology==
Qillqatani is the first archaeological site in the [[Lake Titicaca]] basin to be systematically excavated. Archaeologists have identified 36 cultural strata at the site. From 7500 to 4000 [[Before present|BP]], Qillqatani was inhabited by hunter-gatherers as a seasonal campsite. These early occupants hunted mostly camelids, and some deer.{{sfn|Peregrine|2001}} From 3660 BP onwards, Qillqatani was inhabited by pastoralist camelid-herders who built houses and began to occupy the site long-term.{{sfn|Peregrine|2001}} These later occupants also began to trade with people from lower attitudes to obtain ''[[Chenopodium]]''.{{sfn|Peregrine|2001}}

'''Rafael Navarro Núñez''' (April 25, 1946 – July 27, 2015) was a Spanish painter.

==Biography ==
Nuñez studied at ''la'' ''Escuela de Artes Aplicadas'' ''y Oficios Artísticos de [[Córdoba, Andalusia|Córdoba]]''  (the Córdoba School of Arts and Crafts), and in 1968 began advanced studies in the Santa Isabel of Hungary School of Fine Arts in [[Seville]]. In 1970, he joined the Saint Fernando School of Fine Arts of [[Madrid]], where he spent three years dedicated to painting, silkscreen printing, mural art, the xylography and chalcography. At the same time, he undertook four courses in Drawing in the ''Círculo de Bellas Artes'' in Madrid.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author= |url=http://www.eldiadecordoba.es/article/ocio/2079735/rafael/navarro/pintor/cordobes/la/voz/expresionista/muere/los/anos.html |title=Rafael Navarro, el pintor cordobés de la voz expresionista, muere |publisher=Eldiadecordoba.es |date=July 28, 2015 |accessdate=2015-09-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

From 1980 to 1986, Nuñez served as professor at the Córdoba School of Arts and Crafts, eventually leaving to devote himself entirely to painting.

He died in 2015.

== Career ==
[[File:Rafael Navarro, ante una de sus obras.jpg|280px|thumb|Rafael Navarro (2009)]]

His first individual exhibition was at the Madrilenian Gallery Novart in 1978. More than thirty individual exhibitions followed as well as other collective exhibitions.

Navarro liked to classify his work as [[expressionist]], somewhere between the Spanish "figuración" and [[abstract art|abstract]]. Madrid, where he spent ten years training, has always been a clear influence, especially in his grandmasters projects Goya (the [[Goya]] of the [[Black Paintings]]) as well as painters [[Francis Bacon (painter)|Francis Bacon]] and [[Antonio Saura]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.diariocordoba.com/noticias/cultura/fallece-pintor-expresionista-cordobes-rafael-navarro_977748.html |title=Fallece el pintor expresionista cordobés Rafael Navarro – Cultura – Diario Córdoba |publisher=Diariocordoba.com |date=July 28, 2015 |accessdate=2015-09-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="arsoperandi1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.arsoperandi.com/2015/07/muere-el-pintor-rafael-navarro.html |title=Fallece el pintor Rafael Navarro |publisher=Ars Operandi |date=July 27, 2015 |accessdate=2015-09-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He participated in the collective sample, "60 Years of Contemporary Art", in Córdoba (1953–2013) which was celebrated in four headquarters at the same time in December 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://cultura.cordoba.es/uploads/Publicaciones/201412-60anios-catalogo.pdf |format=PDF |title=60 Anos De Arte Contemporaneo en Cordoba : 1953–2013 |publisher=Cultura.cordoba.es |accessdate=2015-09-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Kassel exhibition===
In October 2012, he prepared a sample of his works, a magna exhibition with more than 130 works that covered more than 30 years of his work. Organized by Michael Wilkens, architect and chair of Theory of the Architecture of the [[University of Kassel]] and founder of the group Baufrösche (Ranitas constructors),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author= |url=https://www.baufroesche.de/ |title=Baufrösche |publisher=Baufroesche.de |date= |accessdate=2015-09-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; Navarro exhibited in the Atelier of Langestrasse ([[Kassel]], Germany) a group of works that were painted from 1980 to 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Manuel J. Albert |url=http://cordopolis.es/2012/10/01/rafael-navarro-el-lado-oscuro-de-la-condicion-humana/ |title=Navarro: el lado oscuro de la condición humana &amp;#124; CORDÓPOLIS, el Diario Digital de Córdoba |publisher=Cordopolis.es |date= |accessdate=2015-09-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; The exhibition displayed one of Navarro's last series, titled ''Nosferatu'', in addition to the series ''Matador'' and ''Toxic Landscape'', painted between 2004 and 2010. Eighteen pictures were added to the exhibition from the collector and commissioner of the exhibition, Alfonso Rodríguez, who contributed works between 1984 and 2004.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.diariocordoba.com/noticias/cultura/rafael-navarro-expone-muestra-obra-alemania_754715.html |title=Rafael Navarro expone una muestra de su obra en Alemania – Cultura – Diario Córdoba |publisher=Diariocordoba.com |date=October 23, 2012 |accessdate=2015-09-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="13386">'''Ratification''' is a [[principal (commercial law)|principal]]'s approval of an act of its [[agent (law)|agent]] that lacked the authority to bind the principal legally. Ratification defines the international act in which a state indicates its consent to be bound to a treaty if the parties intended to show their consent by such an act. In the case of bilateral treaties, ratification is usually accomplished by exchanging the requisite instruments, and in the case of multilateral treaties, the usual procedure is for the [[depositary]] to collect the ratifications of all states, keeping all parties informed of the situation.

The institution of ratification grants states the necessary time-frame to seek the required approval for the treaty on the domestic level and to enact the necessary legislation to give domestic effect to that treaty.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://treaties.un.org/pages/Overview.aspx?path=overview/glossary/page1_en.xml#ratification|title=United Nations Treaty Collection|author=|date=|website=un.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; The term applies to private [[contract law]], international [[treaty|treaties]], and [[constitution]]s in [[federal states]] such as the [[United States]] and [[Canada]]. The term is also used in [[parliamentary procedure]] in [[deliberative assembly|deliberative assemblies]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite parl|title = RONR|edition = 11th|year = 2011|pages = 124-125}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Private law ==
In [[contract law]], the need for ratification can arise in two ways: if the agent attempts to bind the principal despite lacking the authority to do so; and if the principal authorizes the agent to make an agreement, but reserves the right to approve it. An example of the former situation is an employee not normally responsible for procuring supplies contracting to do so on the employer's behalf. The employer's choice on discovering the contract is to ratify it or to repudiate it.

The latter situation is common in [[trade union]] [[collective bargaining agreements]]. The union authorizes one or more people to negotiate and sign an agreement with management. A collective bargaining agreement can not become legally binding until the union members ratify the agreement. If they do not approve it, the agreement is void, and negotiations resume.

== Ratification of an international treaty ==
{{Main|Treaty}}
{{See also|List of treaties by number of parties}}

The ratification of international treaties is always accomplished by filing instruments of ratification as provided for in the treaty.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://treaties.un.org/Pages/Overview.aspx?path=overview/glossary/page1_en.xml#ratification|publisher=United Nations|title=Glossary of terms relating to Treaty actions}}&lt;/ref&gt; In most democracies, the legislature authorizes the government to ratify treaties through standard legislative procedures by passing a bill.

=== India ===

The [[President of India|President]] makes a treaty in exercise of his executive power, on the aid and the advice of the Council of Ministers headed by the [[Prime Minister of India|Prime Minister]], and no court of law in India may question its validity. However, no agreement or treaty entered into by the president is enforceable by the courts which is incompatible with Indian constitution/ national law, as India follows [[Monism and dualism in international law|dualist theory]] for the implementation of international laws.

If the [[Parliament of India|Parliament]] wishes to codify the agreement entered into by the executive thereby making it enforceable by the courts of India, it may do so under [[wikisource:Constitution of India/Part XI|Article 253]] of the constitution.

=== United Kingdom ===
Treaty ratification was a [[Royal Prerogative]], exercised by [[Queen of the United Kingdom|Her Majesty]] on the advice of [[Her Majesty's Government|her Government]]. By a convention called the [[Ponsonby Rule]], treaties were usually placed before parliament for 21 days before ratification. It was put onto a statutory footing by the [[Constitutional Reform and Governance Act 2010]].

=== United States ===
Treaty power is a co-ordinated effort between the Executive branch and the Senate. The President may form and negotiate, but the treaty must be advised and consented to by a [[two-thirds majority|two-thirds vote]] in the [[US Senate|Senate]]. Only after the Senate approves the treaty can the President ratify it. Once it is ratified, it becomes binding on all the states under the [[Supremacy Clause]]. While the [[US House of Representatives|House of Representatives]] does not vote on it at all, the requirement for the Senate's advice and consent to ratification makes it considerably more difficult to rally enough political support for international treaties. Also, if implementation of the treaty requires the expenditure of funds, the House of Representatives may be able to block or at least impede such implementation by refusing to vote for the appropriation of the necessary funds.

The President usually submits a treaty to the [[United States Senate Committee on Foreign Relations|Senate Foreign Relations Committee]] (SFRC) along with an accompanying resolution of ratification or accession. If the treaty and resolution receive favorable committee consideration (a committee vote in favor of ratification or accession), the treaty is then forwarded to the floor of the full Senate for such a vote. The treaty or legislation does not apply until it has been ratified. A multilateral agreement may provide that it will take effect upon its ratification by less than all of the signatories.&lt;ref&gt;An example for such a treaty can be seen in the Convention on Cluster Munitions, which enters into force as soon as it has been ratified by at least 30 states (Article 17).&lt;/ref&gt; Even though such a treaty takes effect, it does not apply to signatories that have not ratified it. Accession has the same legal effect as ratification, for treaties already negotiated and signed by other states.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://untreaty.un.org/ola-internet/Assistance/guide.htm|title=United Nations - Office of Legal Affairs|author=|date=|website=untreaty.un.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; An example of a treaty to which the Senate did not advise and consent to ratification is the [[Treaty of Versailles]], which failed to garner support because of the [[Covenant of the League of Nations]].

The US can also enter into international agreements by way of [[Executive agreement#In the United States|executive agreement]]s. They are not made under the Treaty Clause and do not require ratification of two thirds of the Senate. Congressional-executive agreements are passed by a majority of both houses of Congress as a regular law. If the agreement is completely within the President's constitutional powers, it can be made by the President alone without Congressional approval, but it will have the force of an executive order and can be unilaterally revoked by a future President. All types of agreements are treated internationally as "treaties". See [[Foreign policy of the United States#Law]].

=== Australia ===
In [[Australia]], power to enter into treaties is an executive power within Section 51 of the Australian Constitution so the [[Australian Government]] may enter into a binding treaty without seeking parliamentary approval. However, implementation of treaties requires legislation by the [[Australian parliament]], following [[Section 51(xxix) of the Australian Constitution]], signed by the [[Governor-General of Australia]].

=== Japan ===
In [[Japan]], in principle both houses of the parliament (the [[Diet of Japan|National Diet]]) must approve the treaty for ratification. If the [[House of Councilors]] rejects a treaty approved by the [[House of Representatives of Japan|House of Representatives]], and a joint committee of both houses cannot come to agreement on amendments to the original text of the treaty, or the House of Councilors fails to decide on a treaty for more than thirty days, the House of Representatives the will be regarded as the vote of the National Diet approving the ratification. The approved treaty will then be promulgated into law by the act of the [[Emperor of Japan|Emperor]].

== Ratification of a constitution ==
Federations usually require the support of both the federal government and some given percentage of the constituent governments for amendments to the federal constitution to take effect.

=== Ratification in the Constitution of India ===
{{see|Amendment of the Constitution of India}}
Not all constitutional amendments in India require ratification by the states. Only constitutional amendments that seek to make any change in any of the provisions mentioned in the proviso to [[wikisource:Constitution of India/Part XX|Article 368]] of the Constitution of India, must be ratified by the Legislatures of not less than one-half of the States. These provisions relate to certain matters concerning the federal structure or of common interest to both the Union and the States viz., the election of the President (articles 54 and 55); the extent of the executive power of the Union and the States (Articles 73 and 162); the High Courts for Union territories (Article 241); The Union Judiciary and the High Courts in the States (Chapter IV of Part V and Chapter V of Part VI); the distribution of legislative powers between the Union and the States (Chapter I of Part XI and Seventh Schedule); the representation of States in Parliament; and the provision for amendment of the Constitution laid down in Article 368. Ratification is done by a resolution passed by the State Legislatures. There is no specific time limit for the ratification of an amending Bill by the State Legislatures. However, the resolutions ratifying the proposed amendment must be passed before the amending Bill is presented to the President for his assent.&lt;ref name="Nature and Scope"&gt;{{cite web|title=Constitution Amendment: Nature and Scope of the Amending Process|url=http://164.100.47.134/intranet/CAI/1.pdf|work=Lok Sabha Secretariat|accessdate=1 December 2013|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131203013055/http://164.100.47.134/intranet/CAI/1.pdf|archivedate=3 December 2013|df=}} {{PD-notice}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, when the treaty terms are interfering with the powers exclusively applicable to states ([[State List]]), prior ratification of all applicable states are to be obtained per [[wikisource:Constitution of India/Part XI|Article 252]] of the Indian constitution before the ratification by the [[Parliament of India|Parliament]].

=== Ratification in the United States Constitution ===
{{Main|History of the United States Constitution}}
[[Article Seven of the United States Constitution|Article Seven]] of the [[United States Constitution|constitution]] of the [[United States]] describes the process by which the entire document was to become effective. It required that conventions of nine of the thirteen original [[U.S. state|States]] ratify the constitution. If fewer than thirteen states ratified the document, it would become effective only among the states ratifying it.&lt;ref&gt;U.S. Const. art. VII.&lt;/ref&gt; [[New Hampshire]] was the ninth state to ratify, doing so on June 21, 1788, but, as a practical matter, it was decided to delay implementation of the new government until [[New York (state)|New York]] and [[Virginia]] could be persuaded to ratify. Congress intended that [[New York City]] should be the first capital, and that [[George Washington]], of [[Mount Vernon]], [[Virginia]], should be the first President, and both of those things would have been somewhat awkward if either [[New York (state)|New York]] or [[Virginia]] were not part of the new government. Ratification by those states was secured - Virginia on June 25 and New York on July 26 - and the government under the Constitution began on March 4, 1789.

For [[List of Amendments to the United States Constitution|subsequent amendments]], [[Article Five of the United States Constitution|Article Five]] describes the process of a potential amendment's adoption. Proposals to adopt an amendment may be called either by a two-thirds vote by both houses of [[Congress of the United States|Congress]] or by a national convention as a result of resolutions adopted by two-thirds (presently at least 34 out of 50) of the states' legislatures. For an amendment to be adopted, three-quarters of the states (presently at least 38 out of 50) must ratify the amendment either by a vote of approval in each state's legislature or by [[state ratifying conventions]]&amp;nbsp;– Congress may specify which method must be used to ratify the amendment. Congress may also set a deadline by which the threshold for adoption must be met.

== Use in parliamentary procedure ==
A [[deliberative assembly]], using [[parliamentary procedure]], could ratify action that otherwise was not validly taken. For example, action taken where there was no [[quorum]] at the meeting is not valid until it is later ratified at a meeting where a quorum is present.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite parl|title = RONR|edition = 11th|year = 2011|pages = 124}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="14069">'''Religiosity''' is difficult to define, but different scholars have seen this concept as broadly about religious orientations and involvement. It includes experiential, ritualistic, ideological, intellectual, consequential, creedal, communal, doctrinal, moral, and cultural dimensions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Holdcroft|first1=Barbara|title=What is Religiosity?|journal=Catholic Education: A Journal of Inquiry and Practice|date=September 2006|volume=10|issue=1|pages=89–103}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sociologists of religion have observed that the people's beliefs, sense of belonging, and behavior often are not congruent with an individual's actual religious beliefs since there is much diversity in how one can be religious or not.&lt;ref name="chaves" /&gt; Multiple problems exist in measuring religiosity. For instance, variables such as church attendance produce different results when different methods are used such as traditional surveys vs time use surveys.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Rossi |first1=Maurizio |last2=Scappini |first2=Ettore |title=Church Attendance, Problems of Measurement, and Interpreting Indicators: A Study of Religious Practice in the United States, 1975-2010 |journal=Journal for the Scientific Study of Religion |date=June 2014 |volume=53 |issue=2 |page=249–267 |doi=10.1111/jssr.12115 |url=https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/jssr.12115 |publisher=Journal for the Scientific Study of Religion |issn=0021-8294}}&lt;/ref&gt;    

==Diversity in an individuals' beliefs, affiliations, and behaviors==

Decades of anthropological, sociological, and psychological research have established that "religious congruence" (the assumption that religious beliefs and values are tightly integrated in an individual's mind or that religious practices and behaviors follow directly from religious beliefs or that religious beliefs are chronologically linear and stable across different contexts) is actually rare. People’s religious ideas are fragmented, loosely connected, and context-dependent; like in all other domains of culture and in life. The beliefs, affiliations, and behaviors of any individual are complex activities that have many sources including culture. As examples of religious incongruence he notes, "Observant Jews may not believe what they say in their Sabbath prayers. Christian ministers may not believe in God. And people who regularly dance for rain don’t do it in the dry season."&lt;ref name="chaves"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Chaves|first1=Mark|title=SSSR Presidential Address Rain Dances in the Dry Season: Overcoming the Religious Congruence Fallacy|journal=Journal for the Scientific Study of Religion|date=March 2010|volume=49|issue=1|pages=1–14|doi=10.1111/j.1468-5906.2009.01489.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Demographic studies often show wide diversity of religious beliefs, belonging, and practices in both religious and non-religious populations. For instance, out of Americans who are not religious and not seeking religion: 68% believe in God, 12% are atheists, 17% are agnostics; also, in terms of self-identification of religiosity 18% consider themselves religious, 37% consider themselves as spiritual but not religious, and 42% considers themselves as neither spiritual nor religious; and 21% pray every day and 24% pray once a month.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://commons.trincoll.edu/aris/files/2011/08/NONES_08.pdf|title=American Nones: The Profile of the No Religion Population|year=2008|publisher=American Religious Identification Survey|accessdate=2014-01-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Pew 2012 breakdown"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.pewforum.org/2012/10/09/nones-on-the-rise-religion/ |title=Religion and the Unaffiliated |work="Nones" on the Rise |date=October 9, 2012 |publisher=[[Pew Research Center]]: Religion &amp; Public Life |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Most Nones Believe God"&gt;{{cite web|title=Most of the Religiously Unaffiliated Still Keep Belief in God|url=http://www.pewresearch.org/daily-number/most-of-the-religiously-unaffiliated-still-keep-belief-in-god/|website=Pew Research Center|date=November 15, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Global studies on religion also show diversity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Global Religious Landscape|url=http://www.pewforum.org/2012/12/18/global-religious-landscape-exec/|website=Pew Research Center}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Components==
Numerous studies have explored the different components of human religiosity (Brink, 1993; Hill &amp; Hood 1999). What most have found is that there are multiple dimensions (they often employ [[factor analysis]]). For instance, Cornwall, Albrecht, Cunningham and Pitcher (1986) identify six dimensions of religiosity based on the understanding that there are at least three components to religious behavior: knowing (cognition in the mind), feeling (effect to the spirit), and doing (behavior of the body). For each of these components of religiosity, there were two cross classifications resulting in the six dimensions:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Cornwall |author2=Albrecht |author3=Cunningham |author4=Pitcher |title=The Dimensions of Religiosity: A Conceptual Model with an Empirical Test|journal=Review of Religious Research|year=1986|volume=27|issue=3|pages=226–244|doi=10.2307/3511418}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*Cognition
**traditional [[orthodoxy]]
**particularistic orthodoxy
*Effect
**Palpable
**Tangible
*Behavior
**religious behavior
**religious participation

Other researchers have found different dimensions, ranging generally from four to twelve components. What most measures of religiosity find is that there is at least some distinction between religious doctrine, religious practice, and [[spirituality]].

For example{{original research inline|date=February 2011}}, one can accept the truthfulness of the [[Bible]] (belief dimension), but never attend a church or even belong to an organized religion (practice dimension).  Another example is an individual who does not hold orthodox [[Christian]] doctrines (belief dimension), but does attend a [[Charismatic Movement|charismatic]] [[worship]] service (practice dimension) in order to develop his/her sense of oneness with the [[divinity|divine]] (spirituality dimension).

An individual could disavow all doctrines associated with organized religions (belief dimension), not affiliate with an organized religion or attend religious services (practice dimension), and at the same time be strongly committed to a higher power and feel that the connection with that higher power is ultimately relevant (spirituality dimension). These are explanatory examples of the broadest dimensions of religiosity and may not be reflected in specific religiosity measures.

Most dimensions of religiosity are correlated, meaning people who often attend church services (practice dimension) are also likely to score highly on the belief and spirituality dimensions. But individuals do not have to score high on all dimensions or low on all dimensions; their scores can vary by dimension.

[[Sociologists]] have differed over the exact number of components of religiosity. [[Charles Y. Glock|Charles Glock]]'s five-dimensional approach (Glock, 1972: 39) was among the first of its kind in the field of [[sociology of religion]].&lt;ref&gt;Glock, C. Y. (1972) ‘On the Study of Religious Commitment’ in J. E. Faulkner (ed.) Religion’s Influence in Contemporary Society, Readings 
in the Sociology of Religion, Ohio: Charles E. Merril: 38-56.&lt;/ref&gt; Other sociologists adapted Glock's list to include additional components (see for example, a  [[Mervin F. Verbit#The Twenty Four-Dimensional Religiosity Measure|six component measure]] by [[Mervin F. Verbit]]).&lt;ref&gt;Verbit, M. F. (1970). The components and dimensions of religious behavior: Toward a reconceptualization of religiosity. American mosaic, 24, 39.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Küçükcan, T. (2010). Multidimensional Approach to Religion: a way of looking at religious phenomena. Journal for the Study of Religions and Ideologies, 4(10), 60-70.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.eskieserler.com/dosyalar/mpdf%20(1135).pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

== Contributions ==

===Genes and environment===

[[File:Church Attendance and Welfare Spending Graph.png|thumb|350px|National welfare spending vs church attendance in Christian societies&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | title = State Welfare Spending and Religiosity | journal = Comparative Political Studies | first = Anthony | last = Gill |author2=Erik Lundsgaarde  | volume = 16 | issue = 4 | pages = 399–436 | year = 2004| doi = 10.1177/1043463104046694 }}  [http://faculty.washington.edu/tgill/Gill%20Lundsgaarde%20Welfare%20Religion.pdf Free PDF]&lt;/ref&gt;]]

The contributions of [[genes]] and [[Natural environment|environment]] to religiosity have been quantified in [[twin study|studies of twins]] (Bouchard ''et al.'', 1999; Kirk ''et al.'', 1999) and sociological studies of welfare, availability, and legal regulations &lt;ref&gt;Nolan, P., &amp; Lenski, G. E. (2010). Human societies: Introduction to macrosociology. Boulder, CO: Paradigm Publisher.&lt;/ref&gt; ([[state religions]], etc.).

Koenig ''et al.'' (2005) report that the contribution of genes to variation in religiosity (called [[heritability]]) increases from 12% to 44% and the contribution of shared (family) effects decreases from 56% to 18% between [[adolescence]] and [[adulthood]].&lt;ref&gt;L. B. Koenig, M. McGue, R. F. Krueger and T. J. Bouchard, Jr. (2005). Genetic and environmental influences on religiousness: findings for retrospective and current religiousness ratings. ''Journal of Personality'', '''73''', [https://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1467-6494.2005.00316.x 471-88]&lt;/ref&gt;

A market-based theory of religious choice and governmental regulation of religion have been the dominant theories used to explain variations of religiosity between societies{{Clarify|date=January 2017}}.  However, Gill and Lundsgaarde (2004) &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | title = State Welfare Spending and Religiosity | journal = Comparative Political Studies | first = Anthony | last = Gill |author2=Erik Lundsgaarde  | volume = 16 | issue = 4 | pages = 399–436 | year = 2004| doi = 10.1177/1043463104046694 }}  [http://faculty.washington.edu/tgill/Gill%20Lundsgaarde%20Welfare%20Religion.pdf Free PDF]&lt;/ref&gt; documented a much stronger correlation between welfare state spending and religiosity.  See "Welfare spending vs Church attendance" diagram on the right.

===Just-world hypothesis===
Studies have found [[Just-world hypothesis|belief in a just world]] to be correlated with aspects of religiousness.&lt;ref&gt;Begue, L. (2002). Beliefs in justice and faith in people: just world, religiosity and interpersonal trust. ''Personality and Individual Differences'', 32(3), 375-382.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Kurst, J., Bjorck, J., &amp; Tan, S. (2000). Causal attributions for uncontrollable negative events. ''Journal of Psychology and Christianity'', 19, 47–60.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Risk-aversion===
Several studies have discovered a positive correlation between the degree of religiousness and [[Risk aversion]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | title = Risk aversion and religion | journal = Journal of Risk and Uncertainty | first = Charles | last = Noussair |author2=Stefan T.

'''''Retro-Pulp Tales''''' is a [[limited edition]] [[anthology]] published by [[Subterranean Press]]&lt;ref&gt;http://subterraneanpress.com/store/product_detail/retro_pulp_tales&lt;/ref&gt; in 2006, edited by [[Joe R. Lansdale]]. It tied in winning the 2006 [[Bram Stoker Award]] for [[Bram Stoker Award for Best Anthology|Best Anthology]]&lt;ref&gt;http://www.horror.org/stokerwinnom.htm#2006&lt;/ref&gt; (the other winning title was "Mondo Zombie" edited by [[John Skipp]]).&lt;ref&gt;http://www.sfsite.com/07a/rp227.htm review retrieved 6/2/13&lt;/ref&gt;

It contains new stories written in the style of the [[pulp magazine]]s of the early 20th century. Lansdale's guidelines for Retro Pulp Tales were basic: "Write a story in the vein of the old pulps ... that takes place before 1960, and with the restrictions of those times."

It includes contributions by Bill Crider, Stephen Gallagher, Melissa Mia Hall, Alex Irvine, Tim Lebbon, Kim Newman, Norman Partridge, Gary Phillips, James Reasoner, Al Sarrantonio, Chet Williamson, and F. Paul Wilson. This collection was issued as a [[trade hardcover]], a numbered limited edition, and a lettered special edition. All issues have long since sold out.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.oocities.org/craigsbookclub/retropulptales.html extensive review retrieved 6/2/13&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Speaking into the Air: A History of the Idea of Communication,''''' written by American scholar [[John Durham Peters]], is a classic and important work in Commucation area and also the first and most well-known book of John Durham Peters. In this book, the author asserts that communicating like angels is "impossible" but it is not just a tragic fact but also a blessed one. This book talks about the history of communication failure from different aspects like philosophy, politics, media technology and so forth. This book won the [[National Communication Association]] Award in 2000.

== Themes ==
''Speaking into the Air: A history of the Idea of Communication'' studies on Communication failure. It contains five phrases of history of the idea of Communication, Plaeo's eros, The Bible's one-way dissemination, Religious Angle communication in Middle Ages, Spiritual communication in modern philosophy, and the communication idea in modern communication theory. It also involves the subject machines, animals and aliens as horizons of incommunicability.

== Book review ==
At the end of the Introduction "he Problem of Communication", Peters asserts that "dissemination" can be more charming：

"The most beautiful thing about our contact with each other is its free dissemination, not its anguished communion. The ultimate futility of our attempts to "communicate" is not lamentable; it is a handsome condition. The notion of communication deserves to be liberated from its earnestness and spiritualism, its demand for precision and agreement, demands whose long history I attempt to illustrate in this book. The requirement of interpersonal mimesis can be despotic...The idea of communication, as Adorno said, would be a condition in which the only thing that survives the disgraceful fact of our mutual difference is the delight that the difference makes possible."

And then in the first chapter "Dialogue and Dissemination", Peters compares two forms of communication: dialogue and dissemination and makes an argument that “dialogue can be tyrannical and dissemination can be just”, which provides an interesting perspective of one-way communication: dissemination. And my study about dissemination of Chinese literature is based on the pressing industries, is all about book. Compared to radio, television, internet, books like newspaper, magazines and other pressing productions can be more like the media of one-way communication, since we can easily make instant interactions through radio, television, internet but as for books, due to the lack of interaction, the audiences may have more time and freedom to interpret meanings by themselves.

To illustrate, we may use the theory of Encoding and Decoding by Stuart Hall, as shown right:
[[File:Encoding-decoding.gif|thumb]]
A programme can be encoded and decoded separately by different groups of people. In a dialogue or any other means of interaction, encoding and decoding can happen in turn or together frequently within a certain time between the two sides. And because of such strong interaction in it, say, the two sides have hugely different frameworks of knowledge, and then what will happen? Probably, they start to fight against each other... more emotion and non-rationality are filled in. Say, the two sides are more polite and open to the other’s opinions and maybe they have to force themselves to adjust their framework of knowledge and achieve a consistent but not perfectly accepted point at the end. As Peters said, dialogue can be tyrannical. More conflicts and disgraceful compromise may happen in a dialogue. Of course, in a one-way dissemination, say the dissemination of Chinese Contemporary literature books overseas, the process of encoding of Chinese writers is complete without too much distraction from the audiences overseas. The writers can fill their knowledge, feelings and thoughts in their books. And through the dissemination overseas, audiences in the far access the productions and decode the meanings by themselves with less distraction. Of course, the audiences could write book reviews or make direct connections to the authors, and at the same time, the authors could hold book launches or make a speech to make connections with the authors. But this kind of interaction afterwards can’t compete with the counterpart in instant dialogues in a phone call and chats in the social media, where encoding and decoding happen together at the same time. This kind of inspires me to reconsider the beauty of "dissemination"----one-way communication. But we should also realize that either in a dialogue or the dissemination, the failure always exists. Regardless of the tragedy, what we should also keep in mind is that “ the idea of communication, as Adorno said, would be a condition in which the only thing that survives the disgraceful fact of our mutual difference is the delight that the difference makes possible.”

He was a Visiting Chair (2013–2017) of the Centre for Corpus Approaches to Social Science at [[Lancaster University]] and was the Leibniz Professor (spring semester 2017) at the Research Academy Leipzig of the [[University of Leipzig|Leipzig University]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ral.uni-leipzig.de/en/home/research-academy-leipzig/structure/leibniz-programme/leibniz-professorship/&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;sup&gt;, &lt;/sup&gt; &lt;ref&gt;https://www.uni-leipzig.de/service/kommunikation/medienredaktion/nachrichten.html?ifab_modus=detail&amp;ifab_uid=0cbed40c0d20170413150016&amp;ifab_id=7053&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career==
Gries earned his M.A. and Ph.D. degrees at the University of Hamburg, Germany, in 1998 and 2000.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.linguistics.ucsb.edu/people/stefan-th-gries&lt;/ref&gt; He was at the Department of Business Communication and Information Science of the [[University of Southern Denmark]] at Sønderborg (1998–2005), first as a lecturer, then as assistant professor and tenured associate professor; during that time, he also taught English linguistics part-time at the Department of British and American Studies of the [[University of Hamburg]]. In 2005, he spent 10 months as a visiting scholar in the Psychology Department of the [[Max Planck Institute for Evolutionary Anthropology]] in Leipzig, Germany, before he accepted a position at [[University of California, Santa Barbara|UCSB]], starting November 1, 2005.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.linguistics.ucsb.edu/faculty/stgries/other/private.html#EducationQualification&lt;/ref&gt;
Gries was a visiting professor at the 2007, 2011, 2013, and 2015 [[Linguistic Society of America|LSA]] Linguistic Institutes at [[Stanford University]],&lt;ref&gt;http://www.linguisticsociety.org/meetings-institutes/institutes/reports/2007&lt;/ref&gt; the [[University of Colorado at Boulder]],&lt;ref&gt;https://verbs.colorado.edu/LSA2011/faculty-listings.html#G&lt;/ref&gt; the [[University of Michigan]], Ann Arbor,&lt;ref&gt;http://lsa2013.lsa.umich.edu/courses-and-events/faculty/&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[University of Chicago]],&lt;ref&gt;https://lsa2015.uchicago.edu/instructors&lt;/ref&gt; and he will be a Visiting Professor at the 2019 [[Linguistic Society of America|LSA]] Linguistic Institute at the [[University of California, Davis]].&lt;ref&gt;https://lsa2019.ucdavis.edu/courses/&lt;/ref&gt;

==Research==
Methodologically, Gries is a quantitative corpus linguist at the intersection of [[corpus linguistics]],&lt;ref&gt;https://www.routledge.com/products/9781138816275&lt;/ref&gt; [[cognitive linguistics]], and [[computational linguistics]], who uses a variety of different statistical methods to investigate linguistic topics such as [[morphophonology]] (the formation of morphological blends),&lt;ref&gt;http://www.linguistics.ucsb.edu/faculty/stgries/research/2006_STG_Blends_CogLing.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; syntax (syntactic alternations),&lt;ref&gt;https://www.amazon.com/dp/0826476066/&lt;/ref&gt; the syntax-lexis interface ([[collostructional analysis]]),&lt;ref&gt;http://www.linguistics.ucsb.edu/faculty/stgries/teaching/groningen/index.html&lt;/ref&gt; and semantics ([[polysemy]], [[antonymy]], and near [[synonymy]] in English and Russian)&lt;ref&gt;http://www.linguistics.ucsb.edu/faculty/stgries/research/2010_STG-NO_BehavProfAntonyms_ICAME.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.linguistics.ucsb.edu/faculty/stgries/research/2006_DD-STG_WaysOfTryingInRussian_CLLT.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; and corpus-linguistic methodology (corpus homogeneity and comparisons, association and dispersion measures, ''n''-gram identification and exploration, and other quantitative methods), as well as first and second/foreign language acquisition.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.linguistics.ucsb.edu/faculty/stgries/research/2009_STG-SS_VarNeighbClusteringAcquisition_JQuantLing.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.linguistics.ucsb.edu/faculty/stgries/research/2015_SW_STG_MuPDAR-AO_LAB.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; Occasionally and mainly collaboratively, he also uses experimental methods (acceptability judgments, sentence completion, priming, self-paced reading times, and sorting tasks). Much of his recent work involves the open source software [[R (programming language)|R]].&lt;ref&gt;https://www.amazon.com/dp/3110307286/&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://www.routledge.com/products/9781138816275&lt;/ref&gt;

Theoretically, he is a cognitively oriented usage-based linguist (with an interest in [[Construction Grammar]]) in the wider sense of seeking explanations in terms of cognitive processes without being a cognitive linguist in the narrower sense of following any one particular cognitive-linguistic theory. The researchers who have influenced his work most are R. Harald Baayen, Douglas Biber, [[Nick C. Ellis]], [[Adele Goldberg (linguist)|Adele E. Goldberg]], and [[Michael Tomasello]].

The 19th century saw improvements to agricultural productivity that stimulated population growth while reducing the demand for farm labour. This led to a worker surplus that was mainly absorbed by either domestic industry or New World agriculture. The surplus was roughly equal between the sexes, however disproportionate opportunities existed for men over women in employment domestically and abroad, and in armed service. By 1850 more than a quarter of the female population of the UK between 20 and 45 was unmarried, and finding increasing difficulty in accessing economic means.&lt;ref name=Lovenduski/&gt;

The 1851 [[census]] put numbers to this disparity – between five hundred thousand and one million more women than men. The figures caused moral and [[social panic]], with the widespread belief that there would be large numbers of unmarried women living lives of misery and poverty.&lt;ref name=Smith36/&gt; Between 1850 and 1900 opportunities for women were expanding beyond simple [[domestic staff|domestic employment]] – at one point representing almost 40% of the British workforce. By the outbreak of the First World War this figure had declined to 32%,&lt;ref name=Leonard118/&gt; in large part due to the decline of the domestic sector. However, these jobs tended toward low wages and poor advancement opportunities; generally factory work, one of the largest female sectors was the textile trade.&lt;ref name=Holloway130/&gt;

The outbreak of war severely impacted these sectors; for example the collapse of cotton exports. At one point female unemployment was around 44%.&lt;ref name=Holloway130/&gt;

==World War I==
Even before the war, six out of seven children in Britain were compelled by financial necessity to leave school at the age of 14 to go into the workforce to earn a wage.&lt;ref name="tcbh.oxfordjournals.org.cat1.lib.trentu.ca"&gt;Vicky Long, [http://tcbh.oxfordjournals.org.cat1.lib.trentu.ca:8080/content/20/4/454.full "From Danger and Motherhood to Health and Beauty: Health Advice for the Factory Girl in Early Twentieth-Century Britain"], Twentieth Century British History, 22 Feb 2013&lt;/ref&gt; In 1901, over half of all women workers were under 25 years of age. By 1911, 77 per cent of women workers were single, 14 per cent were married and 9 per cent were either divorced or widowed.&lt;ref name="tcbh.oxfordjournals.org.cat1.lib.trentu.ca"/&gt; Regardless of their marital status, females were able to find job opportunities, especially during the First World War due to absence of males in the workforce. Halfway through the war, by 1916, the female labor force had grown by 600,000.&lt;ref name="tcbh.oxfordjournals.org.cat1.lib.trentu.ca"/&gt;

[[World War I]] compounded the gender imbalance. The deaths of nearly one million men during the war increased the gender gap by over a million; from 670,000 to 1,700,000. The number of unmarried women seeking economic means grew dramatically. In addition, demobilisation and economic decline following the war caused high unemployment. The war increased female employment; however, the return of demobilised men displaced many from the workforce, as did the closure of many of the wartime factories. Hence women who had worked during the war found themselves struggling to find jobs and those approaching working age were not offered the opportunity.

[[File:Women workers in the New Gun Factory Woolwich WWI IWM Q 27845.jpeg|thumb|Women workers in the Royal Gun Factory ([[Royal Arsenal]], Woolwich, London, 1918.)]]

Many women during World War I sought employment opportunities at factories. Women’s health became a concern, as they were being exposed to working conditions that they were not used to. There were fears that the factory work undertaken by female workers could exert a damaging influence on their health, mind and morals.&lt;ref name="tcbh.oxfordjournals.org.cat1.lib.trentu.ca"/&gt; Specifically, women’s reproductive health was a concern.&lt;ref name="tcbh.oxfordjournals.org.cat1.lib.trentu.ca"/&gt; Britain was looking out for their future generation of workers; Britain needed a healthy labor force to maintain their country.&lt;ref name="tcbh.oxfordjournals.org.cat1.lib.trentu.ca"/&gt; The debate about female workers’ health soon went beyond an earlier concern with just their reproductive organs and functions.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;Vicky Long, [http://tcbh.oxfordjournals.org.cat1.lib.trentu.ca:8080/content/23/3/439.full "The Rise and Fall of the Healthy Factory: The Politics of Industrial Health in Britain, 1914–60"], Twentieth Century British History, 22 Feb 2013&lt;/ref&gt; There were new health codes implemented embracing the health of girls and young women who were in the workforce.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; There were efforts to implement a national occupational health service.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; This service was negotiated between the government, unions, employers, and medical professionals.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; This health movement was aimed at keeping Britain safe pre and post war.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

Also a concern, was women becoming too involved in their work life and distancing themselves from their domestic life.&lt;ref name="tcbh.oxfordjournals.org.cat1.lib.trentu.ca"/&gt; Socially, women were still expected to keep a clean house and run a smooth household. Some men were against women having a work life outside of their children.&lt;ref name="jstor.org.cat1.lib.trentu.ca"&gt;Seth Koven,[https://www.jstor.org.cat1.lib.trentu.ca:8080/stable/2163479?seq=2&amp;Search=yes&amp;searchText=duties&amp;searchText=womanly&amp;list=hide&amp;searchUri=/action/doBasicSearchQuery=womanly+duties&amp;fromHomePage=true&amp;acc=on&amp;wc=on&amp;fc=off&amp;prevSearch=&amp;item=2&amp;ttl=1636&amp;returnArticleService=showFullText&amp;resultsServiceName=null "Womanly Duties: Maternalist Politics and the Origins of Welfare States in France, Germany, Great Britain, and the United States, 1880-1920"], American Historical Review, 22 Feb 2013&lt;/ref&gt; These men believed that it was in the children's best interest to have a full-time mother around parenting the children.&lt;ref name="jstor.org.cat1.lib.trentu.ca"/&gt; Their reasoning behind their firm belief was simply that the future generation of workers were more important.&lt;ref&gt;Seth Koven,[https://www.jstor.org.cat1.lib.trentu.ca:8080/stable/2163479seq=2&amp;Search=yes&amp;searchText=duties&amp;searchText=womanly&amp;list=hide&amp;searchUri=/action/doBasicSearchQuery=womanly+duties&amp;fromHomePage=true&amp;acc=on&amp;wc=on&amp;fc=off&amp;prevSearch=&amp;item=2&amp;ttl=1636&amp;returnArticleService=showFullText&amp;resultsServiceName=null "Womanly Duties: Maternalist Politics and the Origins of Welfare States in France, Germany, Great Britain, and the United States, 1880-1920"], American Historical Review, 22 Feb 2013&lt;/ref&gt; At this point in history women were not seen as equals to men in the workforce and experienced prejudice towards their employment status. Many women were also still unmarried due to the larger number of women compared to men in Britain at this time.

==World War II==
[[World War II]] led to more job opportunities for women. Women were able to use their specific skill sets in the work force. Some women used their geographical skills and training to create accurate maps during wartime.&lt;ref&gt;Avril Maddrell,[https://www.jstor.org/stable/30131212 "The 'Map Girls' British Women Geographers' War Work, Shifting Gender Boundaries and Reflections on the History of Geography"], Transactions of the Institute of British Geographers, 22 Feb 2013&lt;/ref&gt; These women were embraced in the workforce for having such talents. After the Second World War there was a closure of wartime nurseries (Morelli 68). This became an obstacle for working mothers or mothers who wanted to work.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"&gt;Carlo Morelli,[http://tcbh.oxfordjournals.org.cat1.lib.trentu.ca:8080/content/19/1/61.fullmaxtoshow=&amp;hits=10&amp;RESULTFORMAT=&amp;fulltext=20th+century+great+britain+women+world+war+1&amp;searchid=1&amp;FIRSTINDEX=0&amp;resourcetype=HWCIT "Women and Work after the Second World War: A Case Study of the Jute Industry, Circa 1945–1954"], Twentieth Century British History, 22 Feb 2013&lt;/ref&gt; The closure of these nurseries expressed the government’s support of women staying at home and leading a domestic life.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"/&gt; This government decision had little effect on working mothers because they used other means of childcare.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"/&gt; Children would be left with family during the day or at the neighbor’s house.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"/&gt; Women still experienced low wages and high unemployment.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"/&gt; This was due to the ongoing labor shortage in the 1950s.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"/&gt; Their employers in the workforce were also continually discriminating against women. Women in the workforce were sometimes viewed as neglecting their motherly duties. Societal pressure was on for women to conform to certain norms when it came to being the proper mother or wife, this could be interpreted as women choosing not to pursue a working career.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"/&gt; After the Second World War more women were married with children compared to the First World War, decades earlier.

==Government response==
The British government viewed emigration as a solution to several social issues caused by the war and preceding century. An emigration bill in 1918 established the Government Emigration Committee, which was quickly renamed the Overseas Settlement Committee. The act aimed to organise pre-existing emigration societies – volunteer organisations, often operated by society women, set up to assist with emigration to the colonies.&lt;ref name=Fawcett/&gt;

In 1919 the committee hosted a conference on Women's emigration, which led to the creation of the Society for the Oversea Settlement of British Women. Essentially the women's department of the Overseas Settlement Committee, it received an annual budget of £5,000.&lt;ref name=Fawcett/&gt;

The SOSBW had panels devoted regions (Africa, Canada, Australia, New Zealand) and career sectors (such as nursing, training and agriculture).&lt;ref name=Fawcett/&gt;

==Postwar developments==
Further obstruction to economic means came about by the presence of a [[marriage bar]] in many occupations. Also, due to the extended life expectancy of women, the loss of pension income attached to deceased males also contributed to the surplus women issue. Florence White was instrumental in campaigning for pensions for women in order to alleviate this issue.

'''The Geological Museum and Art Gallery of Dilijan''' is a [[museum]] of [[local history]] and an [[art gallery]] in [[Dilijan]], [[Armenia]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=https://www.tripadvisor.co.uk/Attraction_Review-g1160895-d6882916-Reviews-The_Geological_Museum_and_Art_Gallery_of_Dilijan-Dilijan_Tavush_Province.html | title=The Geological Museum and Art Gallery of Dilijan | website=[[TripAdvisor]] | accessdate=20 August 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The museum was opened in 1950 by the teacher Yeghishe Hovsepyan. It provides a comprehensive view of the history of Dilijan, the historical development of the local people, their lifestile, culture monuments, historical and geographical conditions.&lt;ref name="culturaldilijan"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.culturaldilijan.am/attract/gmag.html#.V7WtZNR94rh |title=Cultural Dilijan - Local History Museum and Art Gallery|publisher=culturaldilijan.am|accessdate=2016-08-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; The art gallery was established in 1958.

==History==
[[File:Շենք երկրագիտական թանգարանի, ArmAg (8).jpg|thumb]]
Though the museum was established by Yeghishe Hovsepyan, its long-time director Albert Matinyan and the Honored Artist of the Republic of Armenia Hovhannes Sharambeyan made every effort to make it treasury of archaeological items and works of art.{{citation needed|date=August 2016}} Initially, all the items were collected in the town library. The former building of the museum was built in 1926 as a hotel, later used as a hospital and afterwards again was used as a hotel. It underwent reconstruction in 1927 to host the Geological Museum and Art Gallery of Dilijan. The old building of the museum was demolished, and during five years  new building of the museum was built. The official opening of the museum was held in 2010. It was opened to the public on 1 April 2011.{{citation needed|date=August 2016}}

==Collections==
[[File:Շենք երկրագիտական թանգարանի, ArmAg (10).jpg|thumb]]
The museum exhibits the original works of [[Hovhannes Aivazovsky]], [[Gevorg Bashinjaghian]], [[Vardges Sureniants]], [[Panos Terlemezyan]], [[Edgar Chahine]], [[Lev Lagorio]], and [[Jean-Baptiste Greuzeare]].{{citation needed|date=August 2016}} It has also works of Dutch, Italian and French painters of the 16th, 17th, and 18th centuries, as well as paintings by the American painter [[Rockwell Kent]] and works of [[Jean Carzou]].

'''Waffle''' is language without meaning; blathering, babbling, droning. One might waffle throughout an essay or a presentation, when not having enough material, or needing to fill in time. The term may be derived from the [[Scots language|Scots]] verb ''waff''&lt;ref name=Safire2004/&gt; "to wave, fluctuate".&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | author=[[John Jamieson]] | entry=WAFF | title=An etymological dictionary of the Scottish language | volume=2 | year=1808 | url=https://archive.org/details/etymologicaldict02jami}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The term "to waffle", particularly in the [[United States|U.S.]], can also denote indecision about particular subjects; "waffling" can also mean changing one's mind frequently on a topic. ''Example: "Craig always waffles when he's speaking to Genevieve on the telephone". To which Genevieve usually replies "Come on Craig, come out with it!".'' In can be used as a derogatory term; to describe, for instance, a candidate or politician who is considered to easily switch sides on issues to curry political favor (i.e. "flip-flop"), as an [[waffle|easily flipped breakfast food with the same name]] – hence the waffle famously used to represent [[President of the United States|President]] [[Bill Clinton]] in the ''[[Doonesbury]]'' [[comic strip]].&lt;ref name=Raum1994/&gt;
