The '''All Pakistan Music Conference''' (APMC) was founded in 1959 for the promotion of [[Hindustani classical music|classical music]] in Pakistan. Ever since its inception, it has been a constant source of inspiration for thousands of music lovers nationwide. APMC has been holding an annual 6-day-music-festival of live performances by the musicians of Pakistan for more than 50 years now.&lt;ref name=Dawn&gt;[https://www.dawn.com/news/1135708 All Pakistan Music Conference from 13 October 2014], Dawn (newspaper), Published 2 October 2014, Retrieved 2 September 2018&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
At the time of the [[Pakistan Movement|independence]] of [[Pakistan]] in 1947, Pakistan was so beset with insurmountable social, economic and political problems that fine arts virtually remained neglected. Upto that point in 1947, history's largest migration of people had totally upset the equilibrium of the population not only physically but also emotionally and psychologically. During such times, the arts could not get attention of the people or the government. [[Pakistani music]] was neglected more than all else. People only heard [[Radio Pakistan]] play some music now and then. The memory of live music concerts lingered in the minds of a few. If lovers of music had nostalgic memories, the musicians were totally frustrated and felt neglected. The height of despair was reflected in the decision of Ustad [[Bade Ghulam Ali Khan]] to leave his birthplace [[Pakistan]] to go back to [[India]]. Soon after, [[Roshan Ara Begum]] announced that she was giving up [[Riyaz]] ([[music practice]]) as no one seemed interested in listening to her music. Her announcement jolted concerned citizens into action. Accepting the challenge, they decided to find ways and means to revive and rejuvenate the seemingly lost but rich and glorious heritage of classical music.

On 15 September 1959, these concerned citizens met at the famous Coffee House of Lahore and launched a voluntary organization under the title of The All Pakistan Music Conference. The main objective of the APMC was to promote music and musicians by organizing concerts, conferences and festivals. It was decided to hold, as soon as possible, a large event on national level to focus attention on our melodic culture. A festival of [[Folk music|folk]], light, semi-classical and classical music was announced for 19 February 1960 to 23 February 1960. Spread over five evening and two morning sessions, the festival was an instant success. Musicians from all over the country had participated. People from all walks of life, from all the big cities, [[Dhaka]], [[Quetta]], [[Karachi]] and [[Peshawar]], and from towns and villages all over Pakistan attended the concerts in large numbers. This music festival has recently been held at the [[Alhamra Arts Council]] in [[Lahore]].&lt;ref name=Dawn/&gt; The programme started daily at eight in the evening and lasted for five to six hours with the last evening closing a couple of hours after sunrise – a glorious day had dawned. The festival was the first major step which gave new lease of life to music in Pakistan. Followed by monthly concerts, it helped promote this noble art. Simultaneously, the festival helped project musicians. Great masters of whom the general public had not even heard and who were hidden even from the discerning eye were brought to the forefront.

==Objectives==
The late [[Hayat Ahmad Khan]] (1921 &amp;ndash; 6 February 2005) had been the moving spirit behind All Pakistan Music Conference. He was not only one of its founding members but also a long-serving secretary.&lt;ref name=Dawn1&gt;[https://www.dawn.com/news/401663 Hayat Ahmad Khan's services eulogized (founder of All Pakistan Music Conference)], Dawn (newspaper), Published 9 February 2005, Retrieved 2 September 2018&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://tribune.com.pk/story/334681/tribute-apmc-remembers-hayat-ahmed-khan/ |author=Sher Khan|title=Tribute: APMC (All Pakistan Music Conference) remembers Hayat Ahmad Khan|newspaper=The Express Tribune (newspaper)|date=11 February 2012|accessdate=2 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

To encourage the classical musicians/vocalists living in obscurity after the [[Pakistan Movement|independence]] of [[Pakistan]] in 1947, and particularly influenced by [[Roshan Ara Begum]]'s probable intention to give up her 'Riyaz' due to the lack of interested listeners in Pakistan, Mr. Hayat along with several music connoisseurs laid the foundation of APMC. This project, he hoped, would rejuvenate interest in classical music in Pakistan. Many well-established artists like [[Roshan Ara Begum]], [[Akhtari Bai]], [[Rasoolan Bai]], Ustad [[Bade Ghulam Ali Khan]], Ustad [[Nusrat Fateh Ali Khan|Fateh Ali Khan]], Ustad '''Salamat Ali Khan''' and Ustad [[Ghulam Hassan Shaggan]] have performed at APMC concerts.&lt;ref name=Dawn/&gt;

Over the years, APMC has also brought forth several amateurs in the field of classical music. Notable names include Fahim Mazhar, Abdur Rauf, Sara Zaman and several others. APMC attracts music luminaries and aspiring artists alike to keep the classical music alive in the country. Not only that, both vocalists and [[instrumentalists]] from [[Afghanistan]], [[Turkey]], [[India]], [[Japan]], the [[United States]] and [[Germany]], have benefited from the regular musical sittings held at APMC over the past 59 years as of 2017.&lt;ref name=Tribune&gt;{{cite web|url=https://tribune.com.pk/story/1547329/1-entertainment-59th-music-festival-start-nov-21/ |publisher=Associated Press of Pakistan (APP) news agency|title=Entertainment: 59th Music Festival to start from Nov 21|newspaper=The Express Tribune (newspaper)|date=2 November 2017|accessdate=2 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The APMC programmes, held on a monthly basis greatly enrich the cultural ethos of Lahore. Besides these monthly mehfils, APMC also hosts a yearly six-day festival in which musicians/vocalists from all over Pakistan perform till the wee hours of morning.&lt;ref name=Dawn/&gt; 

Few would know that APMC has also been instrumental in promoting classical dance in Pakistan. Classical dance performances of Naheed Siddiqui, [[Gopi Krishna (dancer)|Gopi Krishna]] and [[Sheema Kermani]] hosted by the organization stand as evidence.

==Background==
Generally, the term [[anime]] refers to a style of animation originating from Japan. As Japanese anime became increasingly popular, Western animation studios began implementing some visual stylizations typical in anime—such as exaggerated facial expressions and "[[super deformed]]" versions of characters. In particular, ''[[Batman Beyond]]''&lt;ref name="ANN2"/&gt; displayed some characteristics of anime. Particularly for ''Batman Beyond'', some of its production processes were outsourced to Japan.&lt;ref name="ANN2"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/answerman/2003-10-17|title=Ms. Answerman: The Internet Question Massacre|date=2003-10-17|accessdate=2007-08-09|work=Rebecca Bundy, ANN}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===United States===
[[File:Thebats.jpg|thumb|right|''[[The Batman]]'' (2004–2008) characters.]]

One of the first noted attempts from American companies on making anime is in ''[[The King Kong Show]]'' in late 60s and early 70s. This animation was the result of a collaboration between [[Toei Animation]] from Japan and ''Videocraft'' from America. The result was an animation with an Anime-like visual style and a Japanese Kaiju theme, that incorporated the cartoonish style of the Hanna-Barbera era in American TV animation. Another early example of this might be ''[[Johnny Cypher in Dimension Zero]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Clements|first=Jonathan|authorlink=Jonathan Clements|author2=McCarthy, Helen |authorlink2=Helen McCarthy |title=''[[The Anime Encyclopedia]]''|publisher=[[Stone Bridge Press]]|edition=2nd expanded|location=[[Berkeley, California]]|year=2006|page=313340|isbn=1-84576-500-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Toei Animation continued this kind of collaborations in the ''[[The Transformers (TV series)|Transformers]]'' TV series, which aired in the 80s. While this animation was actually animated by Toei Animation, the series was produced by and for Americans. Transformers truly showed many influences and elements of anime including story, themes and its style that completely resembled [[Mecha]] anime. 
Another example of this is ''[[Voltron]]''; an American mecha series that reuses the animation from previously released Toei Japanese anime, creating a new story written by American writers. 

This trend continued throughout the 80s with animations like ''[[Dungeons &amp; Dragons (TV series)|Dungeons and Dragons]]'', again co-produced by Toei Animation. Furthermore, through the 90s, many American shows started to be outsourced to Japanese animators, most notably [[TMS Entertainment]], which animated popular television productions such as ''[[DuckTales]]'', ''[[Animaniacs]]'' and ''[[Spider-Man (1994 TV series)|Spider-Man]]'', most of which visually or thematically were not resembling Japanese anime. &lt;ref&gt;{{IMDb title|0085011|Dungeons &amp; Dragons}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

During the 90s, some American animations started showing strong influence from anime without having any Japanese artists directly involved in the project. An example of this can be seen in [[Cartoon Network]] shows like ''[[The Powerpuff Girls]]'' and ''[[Dexter's Laboratory]]'' or the [[Disney Channel]] show, ''[[Kim Possible]]''. 

Some other notable example of this anime-influenced shows are ''[[Batman the Animated Series]]'' which was actually partially outsourced to Japanese artists, ''[[Gargoyles (TV series)|Gargoyles]]'', and more recently ''[[Teen Titans (TV series)|Teen Titans]]'' and ''[[The Batman (TV series)|The Batman]]''.

The advent of Japanese anime stylizations appearing in Western animation questioned the established meaning of "anime".&lt;ref name="whatisanime"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/editorial/2002-07-26|title=What is anime?|date=2002-07-26|work=ANN|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070820052800/http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/editorial/2002-07-26|archivedate=20 August 2007 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;|deadurl=no|accessdate=2007-08-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; The production on ''[[The Animatrix]]'' began when the [[Wachowskis]] visited some of the creators of the anime films that had been strong influences on their work, and decided to collaborate with them.&lt;ref&gt;"What is Animatrix?" feature on ''[[The Matrix Revisited]]'' DVD.&lt;/ref&gt; 

''[[Avatar: The Last Airbender]]'', and its sequel series ''[[The Legend of Korra]]'' are other examples of Western anime so heavily influenced by Japanese anime that they started discussions among fans and viewers about what is an Anime and should a non-Japanese animation be called an Anime.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://news.awn.com/index.php?ltype=top&amp;newsitem_no=13156 | title = Avatar: The Last Airbender Article | accessdate = 2006-12-16 |date=2005-02-18 | publisher = Animation World Magazine| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20061217011106/http://news.awn.com/index.php?ltype=top&amp;newsitem_no=13156| archivedate= 17 December 2006 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Avatar'' creators [[Bryan Konietzko]] and [[Michael Dante DiMartino]] confirmed a particular Japanese anime influence in a magazine interview; that of "[[Hayao Miyazaki]], especially ''[[Spirited Away]]'' and ''[[Princess Mononoke]]''"&lt;ref name = "musogato_elements"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.musogato.com/avatar/magazine/avatarmag1_scan08.jpg|title="In Their Elements." (September 2006) ''Nick Mag Presents'', p. 6}}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as ''[[My Neighbor Totoro]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite video | people = Bryan Konietzko and Michael Dante DiMartino | title = Book 1: Water, Box Set | medium = DVD |date=2006-09-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other studios from which inspiration was drawn include [[Studio 4°C]], [[Production I.G]], [[Polygon Pictures]] and [[Studio Ghibli]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.musogato.com/avatar/magazine/anime_insider-dec06.jpg|title=Anime Insider: December 2006|accessdate=2007-03-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The same strong resemblance can be seen in ''[[Voltron: Legendary Defender]]'', a [[reboot (fiction)|reboot]] of ''[[Voltron]]'' franchise, this time completely produced by American artists. [[Lauren Montgomery]] and [[Joaquim Dos Santos]], both known for their work on the ''[[Avatar: The Last Airbender]]'' and its sequel ''[[The Legend of Korra]]'', served as showrunners while fellow crew member Tim Hedrick served as head writer.

These anime-influenced animations have become defined as "anime", in an attempt to classify all Japanese-anime styled works of non-Japanese origin.&lt;ref name="whatisanime"/&gt; The web-based series ''[[RWBY]]'' is produced using an anime art style and has been declared to be anime.&lt;ref name=rwby /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Lazar|first=Shira|title=Roosterteeth Adds Anime RWBY To YouTube Slate (WATCH)|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/shira-lazar/roosterteeth-adds-anime-r_b_3720316.html|publisher=Huffingtonpost|accessdate=August 15, 2013|date=August 7, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, the series was released in Japan, under the label of "anime" per the Japanese definition of the term and referenced as an "American-made anime".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=海外3DCGアニメ『RWBY』吹き替え版BD・DVD販売決定！ コミケで発表|url=http://kai-you.net/article/7931|website=KAI-YOU|accessdate=2014-08-19|date=2014-08-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Castillo|first1=Michelle|title=American-Made Anime From Rooster Teeth Gets Licensed In Japan|url=http://www.adweek.com/news/technology/american-made-anime-rooster-teeth-gets-licensed-japan-159528|website=AdWeek|publisher=AdWeek|accessdate=2014-08-20|date=2014-08-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; Netflix declared the company's intention to produce anime.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Schley|first1=Matt|title=Netflix May Produce Anime|url=http://www.otakuusamagazine.com/LatestNews/News1/Netflix-May-Produce-Anime-7035.aspx|website=OtakuUSA|publisher=OtakuUSA|accessdate=2015-11-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; In doing so, the company is offering a more accessible channel for distribution to Western markets.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Barder|first1=Ollie|title=Netflix Is Interested In Producing Its Own Anime|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/olliebarder/2015/11/04/netflix-is-interested-in-producing-its-own-anime/|website=Forbes|publisher=Forbes|accessdate=2015-11-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Defining anime as style has been contentious amongst fans, with John Oppliger stating, "The insistence on referring to original American art as "anime" or "manga" robs the work of its cultural identity."&lt;ref name=anna /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.animenation.net/blog/2006/05/15/ask-john-how-should-the-word-anime-be-defined/ |title=How should the word ''Anime'' be defined? |date=May 15, 2006 |accessdate=September 26, 2008 |work=AnimeNation}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
On the other hand, animations like ''[[Avatar: The Last Airbender]]'', its ''[[The Legend of Korra|sequel]]'' and ''[[Voltron: Legendary Defender]]'' have opened up more debates on whether these works should be called Anime and whether the culturally abstract approach to the word's meaning may open up the possibility of anime produced in countries other than Japan.&lt;ref name="rwby"&gt;{{cite web|last=Rush|first=Amanda|title=FEATURE: Inside Rooster Teeth's "RWBY"|url=http://www.crunchyroll.com/anime-news/2013/07/12/feature-inside-rooster-teeths-rwby|publisher=Crunchyroll|accessdate=July 18, 2013|date=July 12, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=escapist&gt;{{cite web|last=O'Brien|first=Chris|title=Can Americans Make Anime?|url=http://www.escapistmagazine.com/articles/view/features/9829-Can-Americans-Make-Anime|work=The Escapist|publisher=The Escapist|accessdate=July 17, 2013|date=July 30, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Torkaizer"&gt;{{cite web|last=Fakhruddin|first=Mufaddal|title='Torkaizer', Middle East's First Anime Show|url=http://me.ign.com/en/news/9594/-torkaizer-middle-east-s-first-anime-show|publisher=IGN|accessdate=June 12, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; While some Westerners strictly view anime as a Japanese animation product,&lt;ref name=anna&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/encyclopedia/lexicon.php?id=45 |title=Anime News Network Lexicon - Anime |accessdate=April 22, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; some scholars suggest defining anime as specifically or quintessentially Japanese may be related to a new form of [[orientalism]]{{sfn|Ruh|2014|pages=134–135}} with some fans and critics arguing that the term should be defined as a "style" rather than as a national product, which leaves open the possibility of anime being produced in other countries.&lt;ref name="webster"/&gt;&lt;ref name=escapist /&gt; 

Japanese anime has also had an influence on [[Walt Disney Animation Studios|Disney]], [[Pixar]] and [[DreamWorks Animation|DreamWorks]] productions. [[Glen Keane]], the animator for successful Disney films such as ''[[The Little Mermaid (1989 film)|The Little Mermaid]]'', ''[[Beauty and the Beast (1991 film)|Beauty and the Beast]]'', ''[[Aladdin (1992 Disney film)|Aladdin]]'' and ''[[Tangled]]'', has credited [[Hayao Miyazaki]] as a "huge influence" on ''[[The Rescuers Down Under]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Michael J. Lee (October 24, 2010), [http://movies.radiofree.com/interviews/tangled_glen_keane.shtml AN EXCLUSIVE INTERVIEW WITH GLEN KEANE], RadioFree.com&lt;/ref&gt; [[Pete Docter]], director of the popular films ''[[Up (2009 film)|Up]]'' and ''[[Monsters, Inc.]]'' as well as a co-creator of other Pixar works, has also described anime, specifically Miyazaki, as an influence on his work.&lt;ref name=pbs&gt;[http://www.kpbs.org/news/2009/may/29/interview-director-peter-docter/ Interview with Up Director Peter Docter].

''[[Stitch!]]'' is the [[anime]] [[spin-off (media)|spin-off]] of [[The Walt Disney Company|Disney's]] [[Lilo &amp; Stitch (franchise)|''Lilo &amp; Stitch'' franchise]] and the successor to ''[[Lilo &amp; Stitch: The Series]]''. It debuted in [[Japan]] in October 2008. The show features a Japanese girl named Yuna in place of Lilo, and is set on a fictional island in the [[Ryukyu Islands|Ryukyus]] off the shore of [[Okinawa]] instead of [[Hawaii]].

In the 1980s, there were Japanese-European productions such as ''[[Ulysses 31]]'', ''[[The Mysterious Cities of Gold]]'', ''[[Dogtanian and the Three Muskehounds]]'' and ''[[Sherlock Hound]]''.

The Italian animated series ''[[Winx Club]]'', one of the most popular and successful shows from Europe, uses a [[magical girl]] concept for the main characters, including transformations for each character.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bsckids.com/2016/02/winx-club-receive-live-action-film/|title=Winx Club to Receive Live-Action Film|first=Ella|last=Anders|date=February 13, 2016|work=BSC Kids|accessdate=June 13, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The French-American [[international co-production]] ''[[W.I.T.C.H.

In 2007, the Canadian anime-style animated short ''[[Flutter (animated short)|Flutter]]'' became the first work from a non-Asian nation to win the [[Tokyo Anime Award#Open Entries Grand Prize|Open Entries Grand Prize at the Tokyo Anime Awards]].&lt;ref name="Leader"&gt;{{cite news|title=Shia wins top prize|url=http://www.canada.com/reginaleaderpost/news/arts_life/story.html?id=48d81cd5-fc45-400a-9a2a-2cc63deaf0a3|accessdate=15 January 2011|newspaper=[[Regina Leader-Post]]|date=24 March 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another example of anime-influenced animation can be seen in [[Wakfu: The Animated Series]], a [[flash animation]] series based on [[Wakfu|a video game of the same title]].

The producers of the French anime ''[[Code Lyoko]]'', one of the most successful works of European anime, explicitly stated in their introductory document that they were: "Influenced by the poetry and the visual impact of Japanese animation, the series proposes a graphic universe that's particularly original and strong."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.codelyoko.net/FRA/Garage_Kids/Garage_Kids.pdf |title=Promotional document for ''Garage Kids'' }}&amp;nbsp;{{small|(798&amp;nbsp;KB)}} Page 2, paragraph 2&lt;/ref&gt; 

''[[Ōban Star-Racers]]'' is known as one of the European animations that strongly resemble anime. While the majority of the creative directors and writers were French, the production team moved to Tokyo to collaborate with a Japanese production team.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ugo.com/ugo/html/article/?id=17924 |title=Aaron McGruder - The Boondocks Interview |accessdate=October 14, 2007 |work=Troy Rogers |publisher=UnderGroundOnline|quote="We looked at Samurai Champloo and Cowboy Bebop to make this work for black comedy and it would be a remarkable thing."|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071030033247/http://www.ugo.com/ugo/html/article/?id=17924|archivedate=October 30, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.g4tv.com/screensavers/features/49962/Ten_Minutes_with_Megas_XLR.html |title=Ten Minutes with "Megas XLR" |date=October 13, 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="company"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.savtheworld.com/eng/company.php |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070813141936/http://www.savtheworld.com/eng/company.php |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2007-08-13 |title=STW company background summary }}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Animation such as ''Oban Star-Racers'' and ''Code Lyoko'', like ''Avatar: The Last Airbender'', are examples over which some critics and fans debate about the term [[anime]] and whether it is defined as a "style" rather than as a national product, which leaves open the possibility of anime being produced in other countries.&lt;ref name="webster"/&gt;&lt;ref name=escapist /&gt; 

A [[United Arab Emirates|U.A.E.]]-[[Philippines|Filipino]] produced TV series called ''Torkaizer'' is dubbed as the "Middle East's First Anime Show", and is currently in production,&lt;ref name=Torkaizer /&gt; which is currently looking for funding.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Green|first1=Scott|title=VIDEO: An Updated Look at "Middle East's First Anime"|url=http://www.crunchyroll.com/anime-news/2013/12/26/video-an-updated-look-at-middle-easts-first-anime|website=Crunchyroll|publisher=Crunchyroll|accessdate=2014-08-20|date=2013-12-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Brazil since the 2000s there have already been countless independent projects for animated series inspired by anime. Projects to adapt popular manga-styled comics like ''[[Holy Avenger]]'' and ''[[Monica Teen]]'' have already occurred, but were canceled in the course of time. In May 2016, [[Nickelodeon (Brazil)|Nickelodeon]] opened the series ''Os Under-Undergrounds''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://recreio.uol.com.br/noticias/noticias/entrevista-especial---os-under-undergrounds.phtml Entrevista especial - Os Under-Undergrounds!]&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Bahá'í sidebar}}
The '''Bahá'í Faith''' and related topics have appeared in [[fiction]] in multiple forms. The mention of the [[Bahá'í Faith]], prominent members, or even [[List of Bahá'ís|individual believers]] have appeared in a variety of fictional forms including [[science fiction]], and [[fantasy]], as well as styles of [[short story|short stories]], [[Novella|novelette]]s, and [[novel]]s, and even diverse media of the printed word and [[television program|TV series]]. A 2005 estimate is of more than 30 references though it could be far more.&lt;ref name="adherents"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.adherents.com/lit/sf_bahai.html | title = Baha'is in Science Fiction and Fantasy | publisher = adherents.com | accessdate=2006-08-12 | date=2005-07-25 | author=adherents.com| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20060808010819/http://www.adherents.com/lit/sf_bahai.html| archivedate= 8 August 2006 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; Out of these near three dozen references, there are perhaps a dozen where there is a significant relationship with the religion, where the Bahá'í Faith is a crucial aspect of the story. The first occurrence known is perhaps [[Marie von Najmajer]] wrote a poem dedicated to [[Tahirih]] in ''Gurret-úl-Eyn: Ein Bild aus Persiens Neuzeit'' published in 1874.&lt;ref name=momen1981&gt;{{cite book|author=Moojan Momen|title=The Bábí and Bahá'í religions 1844-1944: some contemporary western accounts|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=1S4KAQAAMAAJ|year=1981|publisher=G.

Soon [[Khalil Gibran]] wrote two books - [[The Prophet (book)|''The Prophet'']] and ''[[Jesus, The Son of Man]]'' - with some second hand evidence for the sustained influence of [[`Abdu'l-Bahá]] in these works.&lt;ref name="marziehgail"&gt;{{cite magazine | last = Gail | first = Marzieh | title = Juliet Thompson Remembers Kahlil Gibran as told to Marzieh Gail |magazine=World Order: A Bahá'í Magazine | volume = 12 | issue = 4 | pages = 29–31 | publisher = Bahai-Library.com | location = | date = Summer 1978 | url =http://bahai-library.com/gail_thompson_remembers_gibran| doi = | id = | accessdate = 2009-08-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; In modern times the first known occurrence is of a short story by non-Bahá'í [[Tom Ligon]] ''The Devil and the Deep Black Void'',&lt;ref name="1st"&gt;Found in Analog (New York), v.106 no.1 (Jan. 1986)&lt;/ref&gt; - he also wrote a sequel ''The Gardener''.&lt;ref name="2nd"&gt;Found in Analog (New York), v. 113 no. 11 (Nov. 1993)&lt;/ref&gt; The next fictional publication, in 1991, which references the Bahá'í Faith may be a short story "Home Is Where…"&lt;ref name="adherents" /&gt; by Bahá'í [[Maya Kaathryn Bohnhoff]],&lt;ref name="meri0"&gt;{{cite web|title=The Bahá'í Faith |last=Bohnhoff |first=Maya |url=http://www.mysticfig.com/faith.htm |accessdate=2010-10-07 |year=2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110714144537/http://www.mysticfig.com/faith.htm |archivedate=14 July 2011 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Initially, and occasionally since, reference has been made to the events and figures of [[Bábism]]. As the history of events and coverage of these events in Persia made their way to Europe coverage tended to shift to coverage of the events and figures of the [[Bahá'í Faith]].

==Bábí focus==

===Early writers===
Austrian [[Marie von Najmajer]] wrote a poem dedicated to [[Tahireh]] in ''Gurret-úl-Eyn: Ein Bild aus Persiens Neuzeit'' published in 1874.&lt;ref name=momen1981/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Manfred Hutter|title=Handbuch Bahāʼī: Geschichte, Theologie, Gesellschaftsbezug|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=cLkDQ_b-bIwC&amp;pg=PA73|accessdate=19 March 2013|date=8 April 2009|publisher=W. Kohlhammer Verlag|isbn=978-3-17-019421-2|pages=73–74}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[José Maria de Eça de Queiroz]], a well known Portuguese novelist in the 19th century, wrote a novel [[:pt:Correspondência de Fradique Mendes|Correspondência de Fradique Mendes]] in 1889 and spends several pages discussing the religion of the [[Báb]] and its impact.&lt;ref name=momen1981/&gt; The material could not all have been derived from the most widespread review of the religion in that day - the work of [[Arthur de Gobineau]]. It is speculated Queiroz encountered [[Bahá'í Faith in Egypt|Bahá'ís in Egypt]] sometimes from late 1869 to January 1870. Story is set in 1871.

A more extensive reference to the events of the Bábí Faith comes from an obscure writer, A. de Saint-Quentin, in the book ''Un Amour au Pays des Mages'' in 1891 in the background of many events of the Bábí period.&lt;ref name=momen1981/&gt;

Polish/Russian playwright [[Isabella Grinevskaya]] wrote the play ''Báb'' based on the life and events of the founder of the [[Bábism|Bábí religion]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last = Grinevskaya | first = Isabella | title = Bab | work = | publisher = | year = 1916|edition=reprint|url =http://imwerden.de/pdf/grinevskaya_bab.pdf | format = PDF  | accessdate = 2009-03-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; which was performed in St. Petersburg in 1904 and again in 1916/7,&lt;ref name="notes-ii"&gt;{{cite journal | last = Hassall | first = Graham | title = Notes on the Babi and Baha'i Religions in Russia and its territories | journal = Journal of Bahá'í Studies | volume = 5 | issue = 3 | pages =41–80, 86 | publisher = | location = | year = 1993 | url =http://bahai-library.com/hassall_babi_bahai_russia| doi = | id = | accessdate = 2009-03-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; and lauded by [[Leo Tolstoy]] and other reviewers at the time.&lt;ref name="russia"&gt;{{cite web | last = Momen | first = Moojan | title = Russia  | work = Draft for "A Short Encyclopedia of the Bahá'í Faith" | publisher = Bahá'í Library Online | url =http://bahai-library.com/momen_encyclopedia_russia | accessdate = 2008-04-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1904 Edith Wharton published a short story with mention of the Bábí Faith.

=== Sherlock Holmes "The Bab Deception" by William C Paxton ===
Published as one of four stories (78 pages out of a total 239), "The Bab Deception" in ''The Hidden Adventures of Sherlock Holmes'' by non-Bahá'í William "Bill" Paxton (not the actor [[Bill Paxton]]) was published in 2000-1.&lt;ref name="amazon"&gt;{{cite web |title=The Hidden Adventures of Sherlock Holmes: A Novel and Three Short Stories [Hardcover] |url=https://www.amazon.com/The-Hidden-Adventures-Sherlock-Holmes/dp/097022981X | date = 2006-06-05 | isbn = 097022981X}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ebay"&gt;{{cite web |title = ebay.com entry |url =http://www.ebay.com/ |date=2006-06-05 |accessdate=2013-04-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; A published synopsis:&lt;ref name="schoolandholmes"&gt;{{cite web |title = Sherlockian Story Summaries - P's | url = http://www.schoolandholmes.com/summariesp.html | accessdate = 2006-08-12 | date = 2006-06-05| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060810132252/http://www.schoolandholmes.com/summariesp.html| archivedate= 10 August 2006 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; Set in August, 1896, [[Sherlock Holmes]] expounds at great length on his occult beliefs and invites [[John Watson (Sherlock Holmes)|Watson]] to a ([[spiritualism]] based) [[séance]]. Lestrade &amp; Macintosh take Holmes &amp; Watson to the home of Sir Randolph Gretzinger, former Ambassador to [[Persia]], who has been murdered along with his servant. Holmes finds a copy of the [[Bayán (exposition)|Bayán]] in Gretzinger's hand, and he expounds at length on [[Bábism]]. Side note: Holmes is presented as having a high regard for the religion and being current on its situation enough to know that "Abo ol-Baha" is a political prisoner at that time and knowing full well that the religion would never associate with such a plot having already suffered many [[martyr]]s and known to not organize any rebellion and instead maintained a peaceful, unified vision with all mankind. He deduces that the men have been injected with poison (from small wounds in their thumbs), and expounds at length on snake venom. The following day they are summoned to the [[Diogenes Club]], where Mycroft expounds at great length on the politics of petroleum and how this may be the true reason for the murder. After visiting the dead man's widow and urging her to continue his oil negotiations with the [[Shah]] of Persia Holmes is visited by representatives of the [[Bahá'í Faith]] who fear that the book was planted on the body to implicate them. They expound at length on the assassination of the last Shah and feel an effort is being made to frame them, but Holmes assures them he is well aware of the reputation of the Bahá'ís and believes in their innocence. Holmes &amp; Watson are invited to a séance and Holmes expounds at length on the other guests. At the séance a spirit claiming to be Moriarty hurls a dagger at Holmes. Holmes organizes London Baha'is into a "Baker Street Baha'i", including ones in the Russian Embassy, to locate Gretzinger's missing appointment book from which Holmes is able to learn the murderer's name and establish the innocence of the Bahá'ís.

Note that on 1 May 1896 [[Nasser-al-Din Shah]] was indeed assassinated and some did blame a Babí but most information points to an anarchist who had been given privileged access to the person of the Shah because of the Shah’s sympathies for his suffering.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite EB1911 |wstitle=Nasr-ed-Din |volume=19 |page=249}}&lt;/ref&gt; Most Baha’is have some information of an acknowledged assassination plot by some Babis in 1852 for which Bahá’u’lláh was encarcerated in the Siyah-Chal and eventually found innocent albeit much property had been confiscated or lost to mobs as a result of simply being accused. This is a different incident.

=== Bahiyyih Nakhjavani's books ===
''The Saddlebag: A Fable for Doubters and Seekers'', a published review of the 2000 publication&lt;ref name="amazon2"&gt;{{cite web | title = Amazon.com |isbn=0807083437 |url=https://www.amazon.com/ |accessdate=2013-04-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; notes: &lt;blockquote&gt;
[A] day in the life of nine 19th-century characters traveling between Mecca and Medina in this engaging first novel. Though they come from a wide variety of religious, national and socioeconomic backgrounds, all find themselves in the same caravan when it is beset by a sandstorm and a brutal bandit attack. Each chapter recounts these events from the perspective of its title character, a device Nakhjavani uses skillfully; not only does she avoid the tedium that could result from multiple retellings, but she also turns the bit player in one narrator's story into the complicated hero of another… Nakhjavani shows how God uses their respective religious orientations and the secrets bundled in a saddlebag to reveal life-changing truths to each of them. The novel's Baha'i message is beautifully rendered in these tales of multiple paths leading to one destination.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

[[Bahiyyih Nakhjavani|Nakhjavani]] has published six books - some academic and at least two fictional, as well as articles and poetry.

Another is ''La femme qui lisait trop (The Woman Who Reads Too Much)'' in 2007.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Bahíyyih Nak̲h̲javání|title=˜La œfemme qui lisait trop|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=lkInIQAACAAJ|year=2007|publisher=Actes Sud|isbn=978-2-7427-7036-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; It tells the story of Táhirih. The writer adopts the revolving points of view, of mother, sister, daughter and wife respectively, to trace the impact of this woman's actions on her contemporaries and read her [[prophetic]] insights regarding her times, and perhaps ours too.

==Bahá'í focus==
In 1911 Brit [[E. S. Drower]] wrote ''The Mountain of God'' around the lives of the Bahá'ís in the Haifa-Akka area and is a thinly veiled set of characters showing the influence of [[`Abdu'l-Bahá]] in the community.&lt;ref name=momen1981/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://bahai-library.com/stevens_mountain_god The Mountain of God], by E.

=== Khalil Gibran's books ===
A published account notes about [[Khalil Gibran]]:&lt;ref name="marziehgail" /&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
It was on April 6, 1943, in her studio-room, upstairs at the front of the house, that Juliet shared with me and a few other guests, these memories of [[Khalil Gibran]]…

"He lived across the street from here," said Juliet Thompson, "at 51 West 10th. He was neither poor nor rich - in between. Worked on an Arab newspaper; free to paint and write. His health was all right in the early years. He was terribly sad in the later years, because of cancer. He died at forty-nine. He knew his life was ending too soon.

"His drawings were more beautiful than his paintings. These were very misty, lost things - mysterious and lost. Very poetic.

"A [[Demographics of Syria|Syrian]] brought him to see me - can't even remember his name. Khalil always said I was his first friend in New York. We became very, very great friends, and all of his books - ''The Madman'', ''The Forerunner'', ''The Son of Man'', ''[[The Prophet (book)|The Prophet]]'' - I heard in manuscript. He always gave me his books. I liked ''The Prophet'' best. I don't believe that there was any connection between [[`Abdu'l-Bahá]] and ''The Prophet''. But he told me that he thought of the `Abdu'l-Bahá all through. He said that he was going to write another book with '`Abdu'l-Bahá as the center and all the contemporaries of '`Abdu'l-Bahá speaking. He died before he wrote it. He told me definitely that [the book] ''The Son of Man'' was influenced by '`Abdu'l-Bahá."
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

It is known that `Abdu'l-Bahá also sat for portraits at the request of Gibran.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://bahai-library.com/bushrui_gibran_man_poet |title=Kahlil Gibran |publisher=Bahai-library.com |accessdate=2012-08-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://users.whsmithnet.co.uk/ispalin/heritage/pictures/dis05.htm |title=Bahá'í Heritage Pictures - Display Five - 'Abdu'l-Baha |publisher=Users.whsmithnet.co.uk |accessdate=2012-08-19 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120815065748/http://users.whsmithnet.co.uk/ispalin/heritage/pictures/dis05.htm |archivedate=15 August 2012 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt;  From the above it may be concluded that `Abdu'l-Bahá and Gibran knew each other more than in passing, but that `Abdu'l-Bahá made no formal or informal claims or suggestions about Gibran's writing but cooperated whenever asked (as for sitting for the drawings.) So the influence is really at the choice of Gibran - he could as well have chosen and mention any other source of inspiration for his book. It seems he chose `Abdu'l-Bahá. As `Abdu'l-Bahá is one of the [[:Category:Bahá'í central figures|Central figures]] of the Bahá'í Faith and these are works of fiction, it is certainly the case that at least two of Gibran's, and his most famous, are properly mentioned here.

There are many reviews of this famous book, ''The Prophet''. Here's one:&lt;ref name="reviewprophet"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.kahlil.org/prophetreview |title=review: The Prophet |author=J Tinsley |accessdate=2006-09-01 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060515192755/http://www.kahlil.org/prophetreview |archivedate=15 May 2006 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
[[Khalil Gibran|Khalil Gibran's]] ''[[The Prophet (book)|The Prophet]]'' is a book that has touched many people very deeply since its publishing in 1923. It has been translated into more than twenty languages, and the [[United States|American]] edition alone has sold more than four million copies. It is considered both by Gibran himself, and by the general public to be his literary masterpiece. ''The Prophet'' is about a man who is leaving a small town called Orphalese where he has made his home for the past twelve years. He has, for that time period, been waiting for a boat to take him back to the land of his youth. We are not told where that land is, only that he has been waiting to return there for twelve years. The entire book occurs on the date of his departure. As he is about to leave, the townsfolk stop him in the town and request that he tell them about certain things. He talks to them about life's lessons and imparts his wisdom to them. He is asked about giving, and he tells the people to give without recognition, because their reward is their own joy. He also talks about things like marriage, work, friendship and also love. He speaks about each, and more, describing the way that people should deal with each issue. This book is an interesting book. It is ninety-three pages of life's lessons set down in writing. These are words to live by, and tell others to live by. This book is certainly a book that everyone should read. Even if people don't agree with some of the beliefs, they should still read the book, if only to get their mind thinking about life, and its many quandaries from a different perspective. This book is not unlike the musings of an aging man imparting his life's lessons to an audience of just about anyone whom he can gather to listen to him. I thoroughly enjoyed this book. Its lessons and stories are wise beyond the ages, and still hold up to be as true today as they were when Gibran wrote them in 1923. The lessons enumerated within this pages are lessons that one would hope were followed by the general population, and I know that if more people read this book, then the world as a whole might become a more easily survivable place.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Here's one of many reviews of ''Jesus, The Son of Man'':&lt;ref name="reviewsonofman"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.kahlil.org/jesusreview |title=review: Jesus, The Son of Man |author=Richard Swartz |accessdate=2006-10-01 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20051230132247/http://www.kahlil.org/jesusreview |archivedate=30 December 2005 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
I find it amazing that he wrote this in the time period he did. It's very prophetic, it seems to be in line with a more modern understanding of [[Jesus]] that readers of ''The Course in Miracles'' and ''Marianne Williamson'' are a large part of vocalizing. But even [[fundamentalists]] would enjoy this book… being how it is written from the opinion of 80 different points of view, many of which do proclaim him the [[Son of God]]. Ultimately, any view can be thoughtfully stimulating because the people of any opinion have personalities and background given that support why they view Jesus with their perspective. The overall impression I received from this beautiful prose is the beauty and message of Jesus, the devotion, admiration, gratitude and love inspired by him, and the grace which he exuded with confident compassion. And whether he was [[God]], man, a combination of both that we all are potentially, or a combination we can only idolize with an envious self-debasing distorted form of humility, this book shows him to be nothing less than relevant to our comprehension.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Curiously, this is not the only case where someone associated with the Bahá'í Faith wrote a speculative work about things the [[New Testament]] is silent on in regards to [[Jesus]]. Contemporaries of Gibran [[Juliet Thompson]] and [[Wellesley Tudor Pole]] wrote books about Jesus. Thompson wrote ''[http://bahai-library.com/thompson_mary_magdalen I, Mary Magdalen]'' and Tudor Pole wrote ''The Silent Road'', ''A Man Seen Afar'', and ''Writing on the Ground'' as well as some pamphlets though these were written later in the 20th century. Both Thompson and Tudor Pole knew [[`Abdu'l-Bahá]] well having interviewed him and worked with him. Thomson wrote a diary, one of the central records of [[`Abdu'l-Bahá's journeys to the West]] as well as a portrait and Tudor Pole played a significant role in saving his life in [[World War I]]. Indeed, the whole relationship between `Abdu'l-Bahá and Jesus was one `Abdu'l-Bahá was at pains to clarify both to the general public&lt;ref name="notprophet1"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://bahai-library.com/zarqani_mahmuds_diary&amp;chapter=2#n17 | title = Mahmúd's Diary - The Diary of Mírzá Mahmúd-i-Zarqání Chronicling `Abdu'l-Bahá's Journey to America | author = `Abdu'l-Bahá Mírzá Mahmúd-i-Zarqání | accessdate = 2006-10-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; and among early Bahá'ís.&lt;ref name="notprophet2"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://bahai-library.com/lee_reconciling_other#fn10 | title = Reconciling the Other - The Baha'i Faith in America as a Successful Synthesis of Christianity and Islam | author = Anthony Lee | accessdate = 2006-10-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the succeeding stories some of the terrorists are instead driven to an unusual world orbiting a [[neutron star]] where Bahá'ís live which eventually reveals that civilizations have reached great levels of technology and then mysteriously disappeared. The initial thought is that the civilizations are eradicated by a periodic sterilization the planet undergoes but there is also evidence the civilizations vanished peacefully before the sterilization speculating that civilizations shortly after achieving deep space exploration reach some new level of civilization that doesn't require or sustain material civilization in deep space.

The author comments:&lt;ref name="tomligon" /&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
"The Devil and the Deep Black Void" had an interesting genesis. I remember being outraged by reports coming from the far east. Vietnamese "boat people" were being preyed on by pirates. I set up a situation where a political upset in a distant colony would make it likely that refugees would be preyed on by pirates. However, the story developed a mind of its own. I realized that, due to the vastness of space, the pirates would be easy to evade. The real threat was the vastness itself. Running away was certain death, and the only hope was returning to face the original problem. That quickly became the focus of the story…

I needed good victims. Recent news had offered an excellent group, the Baha'is, who had been horribly persecuted in Iran. The more I researched them, the more convinced I became that they would make excellent space colonists. My primary reference was an aged primer on the Baha'i Faith by [[John Esslemont|J. E. Esselmont]]. I did receive some comments from several Baha'is suggesting that I'd portrayed them as too pacifistic, however, I'll stick by my guns on this. My characters, while they believe in public defense, even armies, to preserve peace, are stubborn in living by a passage I found in Esselmont's book in which Baha'u'llah forbids the Baha'is from taking up arms in the defense of the faith. The story is carefully crafted to back them into this corner. Our hero is faced with a loss of his faith, which enables him to take action to save his people, but leaves him in a spiritual dilemma.

I left him in that state for about 7 years, when I had the inspiration for the sequel, "The Gardener".

Among the special qualities to Mr. Ligon's contribution to the Bahá'í Faith in fiction is that he is a non-Bahá'í, the stories mentioned explicitly reference the religion, and indeed the religion provides some of the central context for the story line, and possibly the first publication to seriously reference the Bahá'í Faith in fictional literature context. See [[Persecution of Bahá'ís]], [[Bahá'í Faith in Turkmenistan]] and [[Bahá'í Faith in Azerbaijan]] for cases of Bahá'í responses to violence. The final publication, "For a Little Price", is part of an anthology, ''A Mosque Among the Stars'', that is free for download.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

===Maya Kaathryn Bohnhoff's works===
[[Maya Kaathryn Bohnhoff|Bohnhoff]] has won several awards for her works of fiction and music (especially [[filk music]] which is music tied to science fiction or related styles or issues).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.baens-universe.com/authors/Maya_Bohnhoff |publisher=Jim Bean's Universe |accessdate=2006-08-13 |title=Maya Bohnhoff |author=Jim Bean's Universe |year=2006 }}{{dead link|date=October 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Bohnhoff's first work to use the Bahá’í Faith as a central aspect of a story may be her 1991 published "Home Is Where…" novelette summarized as "A Baha'i family from the year 2112 is on a time travel research assignment in midwest USA, in 1950."&lt;ref name="adherents" /&gt; There has not been a published review of her work noting the presence of the Bahá'í Faith in her works generally.

Another example "The White Dog" wherein a lady whose shocking albino appearance is eventually warmly loved in accordance with the special relationship pointed out by [[`Abdu'l-Bahá]] for a little white dog.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title = The White Dog |first = Maya Kaathryn| last = Bohnhoff | location = London | publisher = Interzone | year=1999 | url = http://bahai-library.com/bohnhoff_white_dog}}&lt;/ref&gt; Her longest work with a strong presence of the Bahá’í Faith is ''The Meri'' fantasy series which is a trilogy ([[The Meri]] published in 1992, [[Taminy]] in 1993, and [[The Crystal Rose]] in 1995).&lt;ref name="meri"&gt;{{cite web|title=The Meri is back in print! |last=Bohnhoff |first=Maya |url=http://www.mysticfig.com/Maya_Books.htm#meri |accessdate=2006-08-12 |date=2006-06-05 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061123025309/http://www.mysticfig.com/Maya_Books.htm |archivedate=23 November 2006 |deadurl=yes |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt; The series revolves around the period of transition among the people who live on a peninsula. The chapters are headed with quotes from scripture presented as those of the religion of the people but many are in fact quotes from [[Bahá'í literature|Bahá'í scripture]], while a few are from the [[Bible]]. The first and second book also carry an acknowledgement of [[Bahá'u'lláh]], a [[Local Spiritual Assembly]] and Bahá'í community. The plot involves a progression on the understanding of a people in relation to the role and position of women. Unknown to the people of the story, women have always been instrumental to their religion as agents of [[God]] and a chosen few have always acted as the personification of the Spirit of God, or "Meri". The first book focuses on a young girl destined to take on that role. While similar to other stories of the triumph of women it has several unique qualities most particularly a central male character being her benefactor and teacher and not an obstacle she has to overcome. The second book focuses on the return of the prior "Meri" who takes it as her mission to promulgate the new paradigm as the head of the religion. The third book focuses on her transition to being a head of state but wrestling with several of the same issues from among as well as beyond her people. Another novel she has written called [[The Spirit Gate]] has many of the same features but is written in a different context - a fantasy work set in a historical time and place of roughly 1000AD in the area today of Poland and Ukraine where two forms of Christianity and Islam met the pagan older religion. Bahá’í themes, especially in the respect granted other religions, are largely identified with the older religion, however the names of some of the central figures of the religion appear near the end without strongly hinting at any spiritual prominence (names of an ambassador and Caliph, not simply religious figures.)

Among Bohnhoff's unique contributions to the Bahá'í Faith in fiction is that she is a Bahá'í who has had more than three dozen works&lt;ref name="mayabiblio"/&gt; published in many major and some minor publishing venues and she has written at least 6 full-length novels of her own - four with strong Bahá'í references though mentioning something in relation to the religion in the others. In combination she has probably subtlety or directly presented themes of the Bahá'í Faith to the widest audience in literature. An anthology of many of her stories was published as ''I Loved Thy Creation'' which is available for download for free.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title =I Loved Thy Creation | publisher =Juxta Publishing Ltd. | year =2010 | url =http://juxta.com/books/i-loved-thy-creation/ | accessdate = 29 September 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The center pivotal periods of the story revolve around two generations of researchers: an archaeologist and his anthropologist daughter. Each in turn visits the same African island, but make vastly different discoveries as the story travels in four different time periods: humanity's distant past, near past, near future, and far future. Published in 1997 the near past and future are near enough to have their relative positions significantly altered - the 1970s for the first and the 2000s for the second, roughly now. This book is over 500 pages long and covers a wide range of topics in careful detail from the practicalities of stone axe making, through archeological digs in tyrannical third world countries, spiritual values expressed among aboriginal peoples of the world and the practical lives of individual people occasioned by mystical experiences and those around them, and so on. It follows the form of addressing life in different times and thus a kind of science fiction, but like other entries in this article emphasizes the inward issues and spiritual discoveries more than the quasi-magical or technological leaps made as part of the plot. Mr. Shepperd prefers the term "social fiction" rather than science fiction.&lt;ref name="interview" /&gt; The Bahá'ís, or any paraphrases of principles of the religion, are at best obliquely referred to until late in the second section, of the near past, when an Iranian Doctor mentions the Bahá’í Faith and his reasons for living in a place far from his home and how the principles of the religion stand in the context of the international challenges and needs of humanity. A key character in the book shows interest and later joins the religion but aside from a few specifics there is no clear statement of the future position of the religion nor how the future world culture was established (brief references to a dual process that has merged before the distant future, but doesn't state explicitly what place the Bahá’í Faith has in this pattern.) However, in the header of each section there is a text presented with a dating scheme that is exactly that of the [[Bahá'í calendar]] so for example 2007 of the common calendar is year 163 of the Bahá’í Era, or BE. While the textual reference is exact it only becomes clear when the two dating schemes are cross referenced and the explicit mention of the religion had already been made. Late in the story the [[Universal House of Justice]] is mentioned as having 19 members and a metropolis called Haifaakka is mentioned. However the Bahá'í Faith is not framed as the singular or dominant theme of the story - it is but an explicit component of the plot occasionally and a subtext for specifics recognizable but not identified as specifically related to the religion. In other words, the majority of the content of the book describes how the world at large arrives at a Bahá’í oriented future, but not how the Bahá’í Faith itself arrives to be in that position.

Mr. Sheppherd has published about 10 works before the year 2000&lt;ref name="interview" /&gt; (and lost an additional 15 unpublished works in a house fire in 2002)&lt;ref name="fire"&gt;{{cite web | title = Friends, neighbors cushion a tough week for Bend woman | last = The Bulletin (Bend, Oregon) | url = http://www.uga.edu/bahai/2002/020610-3.html| accessdate = 2006-08-12 | date = 2006-06-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; ranging from professional publications to Bahá'í centered works whether of formal introduction or children's literature, poetry or this science/speculative fiction analysis of the multi-century changes based on humanity's response to religion centered in the non-west, specifically an African island.

==Arvid Nelson's Rex Mundi==

[[Rex Mundi (Dark Horse Comics)|Rex Mundi]] is an American [[comic book]] published by [[Dark Horse Comics]] written by Bahá'í&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|last=Dale Roberts |first=Paul |title=Arvid Nelson, Writer of Rex Mundi |newspaper=Jazma Online |date=2006-01-26 |url=http://www.jazmaonline.com/interviews/interviews2.asp?intID=271 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080120002312/http://www.jazmaonline.com/interviews/interviews2.asp?intID=271 |archivedate=20 January 2008 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Arvid Nelson]]. It was first published in 2002 and has run through 2008.

The series is a quest for the [[Holy Grail]] told as a murder mystery. It is set in the year 1933, in an [[alternate history]] [[Europe]], where magic is real, feudalism persisted, and the [[Protestant Reformation]] was crushed by a still politically powerful [[Roman Catholic Church]]. All of this is woven together as "… a meditation on the prophecies surrounding the advent of the [[Bahá'í]] era.”&lt;ref name="cbr7-08"&gt;{{Cite news| last = Press | first = David | title = Arvid Nelson talks "Rex Mundi" | newspaper = CBR News | date =   2008-07-18| url = http://www.comicbookresources.com/?page=article&amp;id=17297}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nelson compares a central character Genevieve with the role of the Bahá'í Faith - of trying to bring about unity&lt;ref name="cbr12-08"&gt;{{Cite news| last = Manning  | first = Shaun| title = Arvid nelson on "rex mundi's" final arc | newspaper = CBR News | date =   2008-12-18| url =http://www.comicbookresources.com/?page=article&amp;id=19223}}&lt;/ref&gt; but the story is not used as a means to proselytize the religion.&lt;ref name="dh8-07"&gt;{{Cite news| title = Interview with Arvid Nelson 8/20/07 | newspaper = Dark Horse Interviews| publisher =[[Dark Horse Comics]]| date =   2007-08-20| url =http://www.darkhorse.com/Interviews/1470/Interview-with-Arvid-Nelson-8-20-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== TK Ralya's ''The Golden Age: Thy Kingdom Come'' ==
Official synopsis:&lt;ref name="adherents" /&gt;&lt;ref name="tkralya"&gt;{{cite web|title=Tk Ralya |url=http://www.tkralya.com/ |accessdate=2006-08-12 |date=2006-06-05 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070928181411/http://www.tkralya.com/ |archivedate=28 September 2007 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt; "After one of his friends is killed in Iraq, Geoffrey Waters prays for help in understanding God's purpose for humanity. He is whisked forward in time to witness what a world could be like when the prophesies from Isaiah bring about peace on earth, and the lines 'Thy kingdom come, Thy will be done on earth as it is in heaven' come to fruition. The people on the planet he visits explain that God's kingdom will be established on Earth no matter what, even if a horrible calamity must occur." The Bahá'í author notes that this book is her impression of what the future may be like based on the premise of fulfilled Biblical prophecy, with specifics from Bahá'í sources. There are several quotes and paraphrases from the Bahá'í Writings as well as examples of attitudes among various characters that believe as guided by these references, and the book was approved by the Special Materials Review Committee.&lt;ref name="adherents" /&gt; Directly it only refers to the Bahá'í Faith as one of many religions mentioned in the foreword (which also mentions that it is meant to be the first of a trilogy.) Internally the strongest reference perhaps is the name of the Book of the religion of the future - "Qadas", which is similar to "Aqdas" - the central Book of Laws, of the Bahá'í Faith. However "Qadas" could also be rather more obscure references ("the holiness of God",&lt;ref name="qadas1"&gt;{{cite web|title=Qadas-Jewish |url=http://www.orderofstluke.org/deanscovell_book2.pdf |format=PDF |accessdate=2006-08-12 |date=2006-06-05 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20040919174251/http://www.orderofstluke.org/deanscovell_book2.pdf |archivedate=19 September 2004 }}&lt;/ref&gt; or a Muslim style of prayer&lt;ref name="qadas2"&gt;{{cite web|title=Qadas-Moslem |url=http://qa.sunnipath.com/issue_view.asp?HD=1&amp;ID=1042&amp;CATE=4 |accessdate=2006-08-12 |date=2006-06-05 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927010605/http://qa.sunnipath.com/issue_view.asp?HD=1&amp;ID=1042&amp;CATE=4 |archivedate=27 September 2007 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt; for example.) The overall feel of the story is much like [[Madeleine L'Engle]]'s [[A Wrinkle in Time]] - of grand themes being played out not through technological achievements, but of spiritual beings and achievements. Ralya has also published&lt;ref name="tkralya" /&gt; children’s stories, two full-length musicals, a weekly newspaper column in a Minnesota paper for about 2 years, and a novel for 9- to 15-year-olds which also has significant reference to the Bahá'í Faith.

''Doing the Impossible'' official synopsis&lt;ref name="tkralya" /&gt; mentions "three fifteen-year-old girls are starting their sophomore year of high school. The 'impossible' thing they are trying to do is living according to God's standards in modern society. Megan gets the lead in the high school play, but her character is a rather 'loose' woman. Her leading man is more interested in 'fun' than appropriateness… Ashley has a learning disability and wrestles with feeling dumb and unattractive. Brittney is very smart, but overweight. She deals with her body image as well as where a smart female fits in society without being considered aggressive. Baha’i school on Sunday mornings adds the different perspectives of other students."

The unique contribution Ralya has made to the Bahá'í Faith in fiction is that her works center on the moral dilemmas of modern society in the west and spiritual insights and development that reflect an understanding of the teachings of the Bahá'í Faith in response to these challenges. On the one hand she has envisioned an attainable utopia (that is, not completely perfect) with specifics based on suggestions made in writings of the Bahá'í Faith. A particularly strong analysis is made of marital fidelity vs the divine law against adultery vs intense love and friendship between a man and a woman not married, though many topics are addressed including the moral and practical need for war, sustainable economics if children and mothers are of central importance to society, attitudes of the oneness of humanity vs racism, the importance of the arts and so on. On the other hand, she has examined many of the same issues in young ladies lives in high school.

== Karen Anne Webb's "Adventurers of the Carotian Union" series ==
Late in 2006, "The Chalice of Life" was released by [[Dragon Moon Press]], a small Canadian press specializing in science fiction and fantasy.  Webb's book, while intended as a fantasy adventure, includes many themes from the Baha'i Writings, including quotes from a variety of faith traditions&lt;ref name="liz"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.planetbahai.org/cgi-bin/articles.pl?article=319 |title=The Chalice of Life by Elizabeth Lehman |publisher=Planetbahai.org |date=2007-06-29 |accessdate=2012-08-19 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120205195657/http://www.planetbahai.org/cgi-bin/articles.pl?article=319 |archivedate=5 February 2012 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt; and a fantasy version of a society based on the fully realized society of the future envisioned by Baha'u'llah.  Central to the plot (although the idea is referred to rather than explained with great explicitness in the first book) is the idea of the School of Transcendent Oneness and the idea that a special class of being is sent into Creation from time to time to help civilization along.  She relates this to the "once and future king" concept with the introduction of the quest that forms the overall theme for the series: the search for Eliander, a Carotian prince magicked away long ago to a place outside normal space-time.  In the second book, "Tapestry of Enchantment," [[Dragon Moon Press, 2010]] this theme of the once and future king comes to the fore when the one character from a world outside the Carotian Union (the system Eliander's return is meant to save) discloses that he believes he is, in fact, living in the time of his own world's Promised One; his search for this Promised One becomes a strong theme in the series and become the pivot point of the sequel.  "Lamp of Truth," the third book, is due for publication in early 2011. Dragon Moon has contracted the entire series, the longest work it has ever put under contract, and hopes to release the remainder of the books at the rate of about one every six months (slating Eliander for release sometime in late 2013). Remaining books in the series and their settings include "The Life of the Smith" (ancient Greece); "The Floodwaters of Redemption" (Mu right before it founders); "The Treasure of Mobius" (a world projected by a powerful projective telempath; yes, it has one-sided buildings); "Dwellers in the Underdark" (the Underdark, home of the terrifying Azhur race); and "The King That Will Be" (variously the planes of incarcertation of the quest's nemesis and Eliander as well as home on Caros).

In 1959 ''[[Come Back, Africa]]'' film about Apartheid mentions the religion as part of the discussion on the philosophical underpinnings of how the Africans were to respond to the challenge of Apartheid.&lt;ref name=Watson&gt;{{cite web

It is not known if the cause of the mention of the religion was scripted or improvised, and if by the choice of [[Lionel Rogosin]], the filmmaker (who may have encountered the religion in Israel or the USA) or the Africans themselves because of their exposure to the religion in the country.&lt;ref name=Watson/&gt;

In addition to being mentioned directly in a number of works, the Bahá'í Faith and/or its teachings have also been mentioned in the TV and movie industry. For example, the TV series ''[[The Simpsons]]'' has twice referenced the Bahá'ís - once when [[Lisa Simpson]] is considering what religion to join in the episode "[[She of Little Faith]]" she sees "Bed, Bath and Bahá'í" on a sign&lt;ref name="simpsons1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.snpp.com/episodes/DABF02 |publisher=The Simpsons Archive |date=2004-06-05 |accessdate=2006-08-12 |first=Benjamin |last=Robinson |title=She of Little Faith Capsule Revision |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060617231040/http://www.snpp.com/episodes/DABF02 |archivedate=17 June 2006 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; (she ends up converting to [[Buddhism]]) and also when [[Bart Simpson]] is playing Billy Graham's Bible Blaster, a [[Christian video game]] (where the player has to convert heathens to Christianity) "a gentle Baha'i" is one of the images on the screen at [[Ned Flanders]]' house in the episode "[[Alone Again, Natura-Diddily]]".&lt;ref name="simpsons2"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.snpp.com/episodes/BABF10 | publisher = The Simpsons Archive | date =2000-11-09 | accessdate = 2006-08-12 | first = Benjamin | last = Robinson | title = Alone Again, Natura-Diddly Capsule Revision| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20060901024120/http://www.snpp.com/episodes/BABF10| archivedate= 1 September 2006 &lt;!-- DASHBot --&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The movie ''[[The Matrix]]'' uses parallel terminology to the Bahá’í Faith but there is little evidence that the movie or its makers were influenced by the religion specifically (more likely Buddhism and Gnostic Christianity&lt;ref name="matrixphil"&gt;{{cite journal | url = http://whatisthematrix.warnerbros.com/rl_cmp/new_phil_wakeup.html | journal = The Journal of Religion and Film | publisher = The University of Nebraska Omaha | accessdate = 2006-09-11 | author = Frances Flannery-Dailey and Rachel Wagner | editor =Paul Allen Williams | title = Wake Up!

The '''''bon''''' (French Canadian, Polish) was a type of [[paper currency]] issued by merchants to meet the need for small change. Bon is an abbreviation for ''bon pour'' (French for "good for"). These notes were in wide use in the early part of the 19th century. They were sometimes referred to as "shin plasters" by [[English Canadians]]. Because of their widespread use, they are considered to be the [[History of money|precursor]] to modern [[banknotes]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bankofcanada.ca/en/dollar_book/appendixb.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2009-12-27 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061003145644/http://www.bankofcanada.ca/en/dollar_book/appendixb.pdf |archivedate=2006-10-03 |df= }} Bank of Canada - Appendix B - Alternative Money&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.nunet.ca/cpms/terms.htm Canadian Paper Money Terminology&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=eGqeFWhr-5wC&amp;pg=PA100 Money and exchange in Canada to 1900] "merchants to revive the practice of issuing bons or, as they were called by the English Canadians, “shinplasters”."&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4109">In late European mythology and literature, a '''cambion''' {{IPAc-en|ˈ|k|æ|m|b|i|ən}} is the offspring of an [[incubus]] or [[succubus]] and a human, or of an incubus and succubus.

==Etymology==
A cambion is most often depicted as the offspring of an [[incubus]] or [[succubus]] or demon of any kind, and a human.
The earliest evidenced appearance of the word in this sense is in the 1818 French-Language ''[[Dictionnaire Infernal]]''. The 1825 edition of that book has the following entry:
{{quote|text=''CAMBION, -- Enfants des Demons. Delancre et Bodin pensent que les démons incubes peuvent s'unir aux démones succubes, et qu'il nait de leur commerce des enfants hideux qu'on nomme cambions....''&lt;ref&gt;Dictionnaire Infernal, Vol. 2, Jacques Albin Simon Collin de Plancy, p.314.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

{{quote|CAMBION, -- Child of Demons. Delancre and Bodin think that incubus demons could unite with succubus demons, and that born of their exchange were hideous children which are called cambions.....{{cn|date=August 2018}}}}

The word ''cambion'' previously appeared on an early first century AD inscription in [[Gaul]] (Roman France). Linguist Benjamin W. Forston IV opines that:
{{quote|...''cambion'' is from the Celtic root ''-kamb'' 'crooked', also referring to back and forth motion and exchange. It is ultimately the source for English ''change'' via late Latin ''cambiare'', a borrowing from Celtic.&lt;ref&gt;Indo-European Language and Culture: An Introduction, Benjamin W. Forston IV, p. 17.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Given the above, it is probable that the word, as de Plancy defined it in 1818, is a cognate for [[changeling]].{{Cn|date=August 2018}}

==In the ''Malleus Maleficarum''==
The ''[[Malleus Maleficarum]]'' does not use the word but states that demons, including the incubus and the succubus, are incapable of reproduction:

{{quote|text=Moreover, to beget a child is the act of a living body, but devils cannot bestow life upon the bodies they assume; because life formally proceeds only from the [[soul]], and the act of generation is the act of the physical organs which have bodily life. Therefore bodies which are assumed in this way cannot either beget or bear.&lt;ref name=Malleus&gt;[[Malleus Maleficarum]], Part I, Question III&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Because of this inability to create or nurture life, the method of the creation of a cambion is necessarily protracted. A succubus will have sex with a human male and so acquire a sample of his [[semen|sperm]]. This she will then pass on to an incubus. The incubus will, in his turn, transfer the sperm to a human female and thus impregnate her.

{{quote|text=Yet it may be said that these devils assume a body not in order that they may bestow life upon it, but that they may by the means of this body preserve human semen, and pass the semen on to another body.&lt;ref name=Malleus/&gt;}}

The text goes on to discuss at great length the arguments for and against this process being possible, citing a number of biblical quotations and noted scholars in support of its arguments, and finally concludes that this is indeed the method used by such demons.

==In the ''Encyclopedia of Occultism and Parapsychology''==
In the ''[[Encyclopedia of Occultism and Parapsychology]]'' the cambion is said to be the direct offspring of the incubus and the succubus, foregoing any need for human involvement. This same incarnation retained the absence of breath or a pulse until seven years of age, but was said to also have been incredibly heavy (even too heavy for a horse to carry) and to have cried upon being touched.&lt;ref&gt;[[Lewis Spence|Spence, Lewis]] (2000). "Cambions". In the [[Gale Group]]'s ''Encyclopedia of Occultism and Parapsychology'', p.&amp;nbsp;148. {{ISBN|0-8103-8570-8}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9444">The '''Changjiang (Yangtze River) Scholar''' award ({{zh|c=长江学者奖励计划|p=chángjiāng xuézhě jiānglì jìhuà}}), is the highest academic award issued to an individual in [[higher education]] by the [[Ministry of Education of the People's Republic of China|Ministry of Education]] of the [[People's Republic of China]].&lt;ref name="Nature"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Harvard" /&gt;&lt;ref name="WUSL"/&gt;&lt;ref name="NWU" /&gt;&lt;ref name="MOE" /&gt;&lt;ref name="people's daily"/&gt;  The award is also known as the "Cheung Kong Scholar" award&lt;ref name="lksf" /&gt; and is referred to in English both internationally and by official Chinese government publications as the "Yangtze River" Scholar award.&lt;ref name="NWU"/&gt;&lt;ref name="european union"/&gt;&lt;ref name="china daily"/&gt;&lt;ref name="global times"/&gt;

==History==
The initial funding for this program was provided by the Hong Kong-based [[Li Ka Shing Foundation]] (李嘉诚基金会), with the goal of elevating research at Chinese universities to the highest levels internationally.&lt;ref name="scholars abroad" /&gt;&lt;ref name="1000 plan" /&gt;  The program began in August 1998. 

The program has enabled Chinese universities to provide international recognition to leading academics, but has led to difficulties for less prestigious universities in China. Individuals who receive the Changjiang (Yangtze River) Scholar award have become targets for recruitment by competing Chinese universities so frequently that the Ministry of Education issued a notice in 2013 barring universities from hiring away Changjiang professors, and another 2017 discouraging Chinese universities from recruiting away top faculty from one another.&lt;ref name="Nature"/&gt;&lt;ref name="ChinaMOE"/&gt;

==Selection==
The Changjiang Scholars Program mainly recognizes China’s domestic top scholars, who receive the prestigious title of Changjiang Distinguished Professor at their own Chinese universities and are provided with some research resources to enhance the recipients' research programs.&lt;ref name="MOE" /&gt;  This is in contrast to the [[Thousand Talents Program (China)|Thousand Talents Plan]], which recruits top experts from overseas and is administered separately and directly by the central government.&lt;ref name="Nature"/&gt;

Although the award is rarely granted to foreign scientists, a few renowned international scholars are chosen each year.&lt;ref name="Harvard" /&gt;  These internationally renowned scholars include Nobel Prize Laureates&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://en.nsd.pku.edu.cn/article.asp?articleid=6975|title=Gary S.

They are typically honored with a guest or visiting professorship at a major university, with the prestigious title of Changjiang Scholar.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://en.nsd.pku.edu.cn/article.asp?articleid=6974|title=Joseph E.

Although these professorships can be affiliated with any university in China, they are awarded disproportionately to individuals affiliated with the most prestigious ([[C9 League]]) universities.&lt;ref name="Elsevier"/&gt;

'''Computers in the classroom''' include any digital technology used to enhance, supplement, or replace a traditional educational curriculum. As [[computers]] have become more accessible, inexpensive, and powerful, the demand for this technology has increased, leading to more frequent use of computer resources within classes, and a decrease in the student-to-computer ratio within schools.&lt;ref name="Cuban2001"/&gt;

==History==
===Origins===
College campuses used computer [[mainframes]] in education since the initial days of this technology, and throughout the initial development of computers. The earliest large-scale study of educational computer usage conducted for the [[National Science Foundation]] by [[The American Institute for Research]] concluded that 13% of the nation's public high schools used computers for instruction, although non-users still outnumbered users at a ratio of 2 to 1. The study also concluded that computers proved to be very popular with students, and that applications run on early models included sports statistic managers, administration tools, and physics simulators.&lt;ref name="Upi1971"/&gt;

In 1975, [[Apple Inc.]] began donating [[Apple 1]] model computers to schools, and mainframes began to lose their former dominance over academic research.&lt;ref name="Murdock2007"/&gt; Computer usage continued to grow rapidly throughout this era. In 1977, it was estimated that over 90% of students at [[Dartmouth College]] had used computers at some point in their college careers. Walter Koetke, the director of a Lexington, Massachusetts school system commented that, "It's still possible for a student to get through here without using the computer, but he would certainly have to try to do it".&lt;ref name="Haney1977"/&gt;

[[Computer-aided instruction]] gained widespread acceptance in schools by the early 1980s. It was during this period that drilling and practice programs were first developed for exclusive classroom use. Schools became divided over which computer manufacturers they were willing to support, with grade schools generally using Apple computers and high schools preferring [[DOS]] based machines. Hardware shortages in schools became a major issue, leaving many teachers unable to provide enough computers for students to use.&lt;ref name="Johnstone2003"/&gt; Despite this, by 1989 computer usage shifted from being a relative rarity in American public schools, to being present in  nearly every [[school district]].&lt;ref name="Ap1989"/&gt;

===Modern Era===
[[File:Interactive whiteboard at CeBIT 2007.jpg|300px|left|thumb|The interactive whiteboard is an example of computers replacing traditional classroom technology.]]
The early 1990s marked the beginning of modern media technology such as [[CD-ROM]]s as well as the development of modern presentation software such as [[Microsoft PowerPoint]].&lt;ref name="Murdock2007"/&gt; Other computer-based technology including the [[electronic whiteboard]]&lt;ref name="Innovatis2002"/&gt;  and the [[laptop computer]] became widely available to students. In 1990, the [[Methodist Ladies' College, Melbourne|Methodist Ladies' College]] became the first campus to require every student to purchase a laptop. Governments around the world began to take notice of the effectiveness of this policy, and began financial initiatives to significantly increase the use of laptop computers in other colleges as well.&lt;ref name="Johnstone2003"/&gt; In 1996, [[Bill Clinton]] made over $2 billion in grants available in the [https://www2.ed.gov/offices/OESE/SST/tlcf.html Technology Literacy Challenge Fund], a program which challenged schools to make computers available to every student, connected to the outside world, and engaging. This marked a significant increase in the demand for computer technology in many public school systems throughout the globe.

Correlating with the development of modern operating systems like [[Windows 98]] and the continuing support of government funding, the prevalence of educational computer usage boomed during this era. Between 1997 and 1999, the ratio of students to [[multimedia computer]]s decreased from 21 students per machine to less than 10 students per machine. Colleges began creating specialized classrooms designed to provide students with access to the utilization of the most modern technology available. Classrooms such as the "[http://www.cc.gatech.edu/fce/pubs/icse99/node6.html Classroom 2000]" built at Georgia Tech in 1999 which featured computers with audio and video equipment designed to capture detailed recordings of lectures as a replacement for traditional [[note taking]]&lt;ref name="Suggs1999"/&gt; began to become more common. By 2000, the student to computer ratio at some schools in the US decreased to only 5 students per school computer.

As [[collaborative]] classroom environments became mainstream, more schools as a whole began to invest in powerful [[Computer network|networks]] and faster Internet connections. By 2010, many school districts implemented or encouraged "1:1 learning programs" which would ensure that all students in grade school would be provided with a personal laptop.&lt;ref name="Brownjinkins2010"/&gt; Computers have significantly changed traditional teaching methodology into a more "hands-on" approach, with [[Forbes]] predicting that, "Instead of parking themselves in a lecture hall for hours, students will work in collaborative spaces, where future doctors, lawyers, business leaders, engineers, journalists and artists learn to integrate their different approaches to problem solving and innovate together."&lt;ref name="Kembel2010"/&gt;

Experience has shown, however, that excessive use of computers can be detrimental to a student's basic academic skills. The [[Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development]] has compared average student literacy, numeracy and science skills in 31 countries (considering three large cities in China separately). It also compared the levels of student computer use in those same countries. The study's conclusion, after correcting for social backgrounds and student demographics, was that moderate use of classroom computers produces the best educational outcomes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.oecd.org/education/new-approach-needed-to-deliver-on-technologys-potential-in-schools.htm|title=New approach needed to deliver on technology’s potential in schools|date=15 September 2015|publisher=OECD|accessdate=3 May 2018|quote=Even countries which have invested heavily in information and communication technologies (ICT) for education have seen no noticeable improvement in their performances in PISA results for reading, mathematics or science.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==21st century==
===Demands===
The shift in worldwide computer usage and the need for computer skills in today's workforce have pushed the United States government to create guidelines for educators to ensure that students are prepared to meet the demands of the 21st century. The [http://www.corestandards.org/the-standards Core Curriculum Content Standards] for education are aimed at preparing students with such skills demanded of those entering the 21st century learning environment as well as the 21st century and work environment.

Changes such as this, along with the changes in the ways that 21st century learners communicate, have impacted the ways that classroom computers are utilized. Currently, teachers are tapping into the enhanced abilities of current classroom computer technology by utilizing various [[Web 2.0]] tools to enhance their instruction. Such tools are also being used to extend classroom communication outside of the campus through online collaborative tools. Centered primarily on collaboration and sharing, Web 2.0 computer applications encourage student self-expression; interaction with peers, and opportunity for authentic learning experiences&lt;ref name="brooks2008"/&gt; Through the implementation and integration of Web 2.0 computer technologies into the classroom setting, authentic and meaningful learning experiences are now able to occur in ways that have been previously unimaginable. Currently, the learning that is taking place is not simply about typical concepts or facts as laid out in school curricula. Instead, it is about the process of building connections&lt;ref name="richardson2007"/&gt; As a result, the awareness of the importance and the value of communication is becoming instilled into children. Today, with a single laptop, [[Webcam]], [[Image projector|projector]], and an Internet connection, a teacher can broadcast and begin collaboration with any other classroom. As groups of learners coalesce around shared passions online, they experience something that is difficult to replicate in physical space.&lt;ref name="richardson2007" /&gt;

===Applications===
Classroom computer access to Web 2.0 applications such as online learning communities and interactive educational tools offer a more dynamic learning experience, with direct benefits to students. Web 2.0 technologies that are being utilized within the classroom have made it possible for essential learning to be introduced to students during their elementary levels of education and to be refined through their middle, high school and collegiate experiences. As classroom computer technology is being used for different types of communication—for presentation, for class interaction, and for collaboration,&lt;ref name="driscoll2007"/&gt; students are required to be readers and writers, editors and publishers; and must be willing to collaborate and co-create with others, working closely together to learn even more in the process.&lt;ref name="richardson2007"/&gt; Web 2.0 Interaction involves not only sharing ideas or information with someone else, but also receiving feedback. The collaboration engages groups of people in not only sending and receiving feedback but working together for creating, building, and editing,&lt;ref name="driscoll2007"/&gt; These skills are a necessity for students' futures as they grow and enter the workplace.

The goal of using such computer applications is to increase [[peer-to-peer]] interactions through digital means, in order to replicate real-life 21st century communication skills. One such technology that has gained significant recognition within K-12 education is the [[Weblog]]. Weblogs, or blogs, are frequently accessed on classroom computers due to their positive effects upon students. These online journals are primarily used to support communication in the form of presentation, and they provide a useful tool for class interaction. Weblogs allow students to present their own findings and discoveries to an authentic audience. Receiving feedback about course work not just from your teacher but from your peers, or possibly from the outside world, can be very empowering to students. In their eyes, having the ability to publish their writing on a blog suddenly transforms them into authors and publishers.&lt;ref name="driscoll2007"/&gt; Blogs make students are of careful and conscientious writing. Students are no longer writing for an audience of one. Instead, their words face an audience of their peers as well as countless others whose primary goal is not only to read, but also to provide commentary, feedback and even to critique and criticize their words. By using classroom computers for such means, students become increasingly more cautious and aware of their grammar, spelling and word-choice knowing that they are the authors of a published piece of writing that will reach a wide audience.

Similarly, [[Wikis]] are commonly accessed on classroom computers due to their positive impacts. The collaborative environment that wikis facilitate can teach students much about how to work with others, how to create community, and how to operate in a world where the creation of knowledge and information is increasingly becoming a group effort.&lt;ref name="achterman2006"/&gt; The implementations and uses of wikis range from the development of group-based writing projects, to collaborative note taking, to brainstorming. Teachers can set up wikis for groups of students, giving them the opportunity to all join in on equal footing to give feedback, to make suggestions and changes, and to jot down ideas. With a wiki, everyone is an author of the wiki at the same time.&lt;ref name="driscoll2007"/&gt; Additionally, Wikis afford students the opportunity to express themselves using multiple modalities. Therefore, children who struggle to express themselves through the written word, are now at ease due to ability to insert music, graphics, video, and photos into their writing. With the help of this technology, students who struggle with language are now able to create multimodal compositions, allowing them to communicate meanings that were once inaccessible or not fully expressed through their printed word.&lt;ref name="mcpherson2006"/&gt; These ongoing collaborative efforts also reinforce the notion of careful, contentious writing. Students' words are no longer for an audience of one, but instead for an audience of countless individuals. The awareness of this global reach reminds students to be cautious with grammar, word choice and style as they know that others will be expanding upon their written ideas.

Because of their versatility, [[Podcasts]] are also commonly accessed on classroom computers.  These downloadable, portable files allow listeners to subscribe to digitally recorded audio clips and replay them at their own convenience. Similarly, the use of [[Vodcasts]] has become almost as common, as they allow for students to view digitally recorded video on classroom computers. Accessing Podcasts and Vodcasts on classroom computers allows for [[differentiated instruction]] within the classroom environment. These technologies provide students with the opportunity to learn at their own pace and the freedom to go back whenever possible and as frequently as necessary in order to check their understanding. Podcasts are offering [[ESL]] students, and those with [[learning disabilities]], the chance to review lectures at their own pace for increased comprehension.&lt;ref name="driscoll2007"/&gt; Many [[English language learner|ELL]] and ESL students need additional support with defining commonly used language as well as with the pronunciation of new vocabulary. Other students, such as those with special needs have difficulty reading and reviewing complex texts. Accessing Podcasts and Vodcasts on classroom computers can easily provide helpful tools to address these students' needs.

===Ineffective use===
There is very little evidence that shows that teachers are making proper use of computers in the classroom. [[Intrinsic]] barriers such as a belief in more traditional teaching practices and individual attitudes towards computers in education as well as the teachers own comfort with computers and their ability to use them all result in varying effectiveness in the integration of computers in the classroom. Even with the increased access to computers within education systems the actual use of computers in the class room lacks meaningful activities that involve the students.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Zelchenko |first1=Peter |title=Exploring Alternatives to Hype |journal=Educational Leadership |date=February 1999 |volume=56 |issue=5 |pages=78–81 |url=http://www.pete.zelchenko.com/files/Zelchenko_Educational_Leadership_02-99.pdf |accessdate=24 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Teachers also appear to abandon the intended educational uses of the computers purely for communication between staff and parents as well as preparation of more traditional learning materials.&lt;ref&gt;Blackwell, C.K., Lauricella, A.R. and Wartella, E., 2014. Factors influencing digital technology use in early childhood education. Computers &amp; Education, 77, pp.82-90.&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6145">{{History of Taiwan}}
The '''cultural history of Taiwan''' can be traced back to [[Prehistory|prehistoric]] [[Stone Age]]. Later the development of [[written language]]s made it easier to maintain traditions of the [[Culture of Taiwan|Taiwanese culture]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |script-title=zh:''[[Modern History of Taiwanese in 400 Years|台灣人四百年史]]'' |trans-title=Taiwanese People's 400 Year History |author=[[Su Beng]] |language=Chinese |publisher=Paradise Culture Associates |year=1980 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[recorded history]] of Taiwanese culture mainly stemmed from traditional [[Culture of China|Chinese culture]], despite the influences from other foreign powers. Although the culture of modern Taiwan is significantly affected by [[Culture of Japan|Japanese]] and [[Culture of the United States|American culture]]s, the values and traditions of the [[Taiwanese people]] are heavily based on [[Confucianism|Confucianist]] [[Han people|Han]] cultures.&lt;ref&gt;黃文儀，《士大夫與羅漢腳》，《文教台灣》第092期&lt;/ref&gt;

== Prehistoric cultures ==
[[Image:Roundstone1.JPG|upright|thumb|A prehistoric monument in Taiwan built about 2800 years ago]]
The cultures in Taiwan's [[New Stone Age]] (began ca. 5000 BCE) were all left by [[Austronesian people]]. However, there may be other settlers prior to the arrival of the Austronesian people.

In addition, the [[Taiwanese aborigines#Plains aboriginals|plains aborigine]]s influenced the beliefs, music, and names, of places in Taiwan. These aboriginal tribes include [[Ketagalan people|Ketagalan]], [[Kavalan people|Kavalan]], [[Taokas people|Taokas]], and [[Babuza people]]s. However, over the course of three centuries of [[Han Chinese]] migrations to Taiwan, the distinctive cultures gradually disappeared, creating an integrated cultural blend.

The 1620s saw a major turning point in Taiwan's cultural history due to the introduction of the [[Sinckan Manuscripts]]. The written language was brought to Taiwan by [[Dutch people|Dutch]] missionaries. The prehistory of Taiwan was brought to an end as a result.

==European colonial culture==
As a result of Taiwan's strategic position, many foreign powers were interested in establishing [[Human settlement|settlement]]s in Taiwan. Taiwan was first introduced to European nations in approximately the mid-sixteenth century by Portuguese explorers, who called the island "Ilha [[Formosa]]," which means "Beautiful Island, and the neighboring islands "[[Pescadores]]," which means "Fishermen."&lt;ref&gt;[[:ja:戴天昭|戴天昭]]，1996，台灣國際政治史，李明峻譯。台北：前衛。 {{ISBN|9789578010994}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Dutch East India Company]] invaded the Pescadores in 1622. After several battles with [[Ming Dynasty|Ming]] forces, the Dutch agreed to retreat to the island of [[Taiwan]], which was not part of the Ming territories. In 1624, the Dutch established a trading post in present-day [[Tainan City]] and built its political center at [[Fort Zeelandia (Taiwan)|Fort Zeelandia]]. Due to the shortage of labor, the Dutch recruited [[Han Taiwanese|Han]] migrants. As a result, the previous [[tribal society]] drastically changed.

The Dutch were not the only European settlers in Taiwan. In 1626, the [[Spaniard]]s established settlements in northern Taiwan. [[Fort San Salvador]] was built in present-day Keelung. Later, they expanded their territory to present-day [[Yilan County, Taiwan|Yilan]] and [[Tamsui, Taipei|Tamsui]], and built [[Fort Santo Domingo]], which still exists today. Spanish missionaries converted many aborigines to [[Catholicism]]. However, the Dutch attacked Spanish settlements in northern Taiwan in 1642, drove out the Spaniards, and occupied their territories.

'''Cultural schema theory''' holds that human beings employ classification to understand members of other cultures, and add new data to previously available categories.&lt;ref&gt;Shahghasemi, E. 2017. Cultural Schema Theory. The International Encyclopedia of Intercultural Communication. 1–9.  http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/9781118783665.ieicc0019/full&lt;/ref&gt;  Cultural schemas for [[social interaction]] are [[cognitive]] structures that contain knowledge for face-to-face interactions in a person's cultural environment. Schemas are generalized collections of knowledge of past experiences that are organized into related knowledge groups; they guide our behaviours in familiar situations. Cultural schemas do not differ from other schemas, except that they are shared by certain cultural groups rather than individuals (Garro, 2000). Schemas unique to individuals are created from personal experiences, whereas those shared by individuals are created from various types of common experiences (Garro, 2000). Cultural schema theory proposes that when we interact with members of the same [[culture]] in certain situations many times, or talk about certain information with them many times, cultural schemas are created and stored in our brain (Nishida, 1999).

== History ==
Cultural schema theory may be a relatively new theory, but neither schema nor cultural schema are new concepts.

The idea of schemas existing as ideal types in the mind dates back all the way back to [[Plato]] (see also [[Schema (disambiguation)|Schema]] and [[Schema (psychology)]]) . In the 19th century German philosopher [[Immanuel Kant]] developed the idea that every person's experiences are gathered in memory, forming higher order concepts. In the 1920s [[Jean Piaget]]'s work investigated schemas in infants. In the 1930s [[Frederic Bartlett]] tested memory for schemas. From the 1970s to the 1990s, many researchers obtained loads of evidence showing that people's [[behaviors]] are deeply embedded to what they store in their brains. Through these studies researchers learned that [[human behavior]] relies heavily on past experiences and the [[knowledge]] stored in one's brain.

Research also revealed that schemas operate at many different levels. The experiences which are unique to individuals allow them to acquire personal schemas.  Societal schemas may emerge from a group's collective [[knowledge]] and are represented across the minds in a [[society]], enabling people to think as if they are one mind (Malcolm &amp; Sharifian, 2002). However, when one's cultural environment provides experiences to which every member of that culture is exposed, their experiences allow every member to acquire cultural schemas (Nishida, 1999). Cultural schemas are [[wikt:conceptual|conceptual]] structures which enable individuals to store perceptual and conceptual information about their [[culture]] and interpret cultural experiences and expressions. If people are not equipped with the appropriate cultural schema, they may not be able to make sense of culturally unfamiliar situations (Malcolm &amp; Sharifian, 2002).

== How cultural schemas develop ==
{{Unreferenced section|date=July 2013}}

When one interacts with members of the same [[culture]] over and over again, or talks about certain information with them many times, cultural schemas are created and stored in one's brain. Subsequent similar instances cause the cultural schema to become more organized, abstract, and compact. As this occurs, communication becomes much easier. Nishida (1999) simply explains that experience is the force which creates cultural schemas. As people have more experiences their developing cultural schemas become more tightly organized. The information not only becomes more complex, but more useful among members of a culture, alike or different. Beyond the [[cognitive]] activity of cultural schemas is the complex pattern which occurs in the [[brain]].

When humans acquire and retain information from their surrounding environments, [[neural]] circuits are generated. Consequently, information processing experience is stored in the [[long-term memory]]. Memory representation or [[neural]] circuits created in the brain as a result of information processing are assumed to be schemas {{dubious|date=July 2013}}. Thus, schemas provide a foundation in the brain which helps to predict what is to be expected and looked for in certain situations.

Not all schemas are uniformly important. High-level schemas are internalized and emotionally salient; likewise, when a schema is only weakly related to a person's self it becomes emotionally empty and irrelevant (Lipset, 1993).

== Types of cultural schemas for social interactions ==

Cultural schemas for social interactions are cognitive structures that contain knowledge for face-to-face interactions in one's cultural environment. Nishida (1999) points out the eight primary types for generating human behavior for social interactions. These eight schemas are also referred to as Primary Social Interaction (PSI) schemas.

# ''Fact-and-concept schemas:'' These are pieces of general information about facts, such as Washington, D.C. is the capital of the United States, and concepts, such as bicycles are vehicles that have two wheels, a seat, and pedals.
# ''Person schemas:'' These are knowledge about different types of people, specifically [[personality traits]]; for example, Barb is shy or Dave is outgoing. Since people have some representation or idea of what being shy or outgoing is, they tend to classify others, such as Barb and Dave, into their dominant personality traits.
# ''Self schemas:'' These contain people's knowledge of how they see themselves and knowledge of how others see them.
# ''Role schemas:'' These are knowledge about social roles that denote expected sets of behaviors of people in particular social positions.
# ''Context schemas:'' These contain information about the situations and appropriate settings of behavioral parameters. Information in context schemas includes predictions about appropriate actions to take in order to achieve goals in the respective context. Information also includes suggestions for reasonable problem-solving strategies. It is important to note that context schemas are triggered before other schemas {{Citation needed|date=July 2013}}.
# ''Procedure schemas:'' These are knowledge about the appropriate sequence of events in common situations. This includes the specific steps to take and the appropriate behavioral rules for the events. The use of procedure schemas causes people to take certain actions some way.
# ''Strategy schemas:'' These are knowledge about problem-solving strategies.
# ''Emotion schemas:'' These contain information about affect and evaluation stored in long-term [[memory]]. This is accessed when other schemas are activated. [[Emotion]] schemas develop through social interactions throughout a person's life. This schema is relatively new {{clarify|date=July 2013}}. Researchers believed it was an important additive because emotions play important roles in human social interactions.

== Application to cross-cultural adaptation ==
The term cross-cultural adaptation refers to the complex process through which an individual acquires an increasing level of the communication skills of the host culture and of relational development with host nationals. Simply put, cross-cultural adaptation is the transformation of a person's own PSI schemas into those of the host culture and acquisition of new PSI schemas in the host culture s/he is residing in. A number of different people may b e subject to cross-cultural adaptation, including [[immigrants]], [[refugees]], [[business people]], [[diplomats]], [[foreign workers]], and [[students]]. However, this entry specifically applies cultural schema theory to [[:wikt:sojourner|sojourner]]s' cross cultural adaptation. Sojourners generally spend a few years in another culture while intending to return to their home country. Business people, diplomats, students, and foreign workers can all be classified as sojourners. In order to better explain sojourners' cross-cultural adaptation, [[axioms]] are used to express causal, correlational, or [[teleological]] relationships. [[Axioms]] also help to explain the basic assumptions of the Cultural Schema Theory (Nishida, 1999).

=== Sojourners' axioms ===
Nishida (1999) describes the following nine axioms:

'''Axiom 1:''' The more often a person repeats a schema-based [[behavior]] in his or her culture, the more likely the cultural schema will be stored in the person's memory.

'''Axiom 2:''' Sojourners' failure to recognize the actions and behaviors that are relevant to meaningful interactions in the host culture are mainly due to their lack of the PSI schemas of the culture.

'''Axiom 3:''' The acquisition of the PSI schemas of the host culture is a necessary condition for sojourners' cross-cultural adaptation to the culture.

'''Axiom 4:''' The PSI schemas of a person's own culture are interrelated with each other, forming a network of cultural schemas to generate behaviors that are appropriate in the culture. Experience in the host culture causes a change in one's cultural schema. This causes further changes in all other cultural schemas and results in a total change in behavior.

'''Axiom 5:''' The acquisition of information about interrelationships among the PSI schemas of the host culture is a necessary condition for sojourners' cross-cultural adaptation.

'''Axiom 6:''' People use both schema-driven and data-driven processing to perceive new information, depending on the situation and their motivations.

'''Axiom 7:''' If one has well-organized cultural schemas, schematically salient information is more likely to be processed through the schemas, whereas ambiguous information will either direct a search for the relevant data to complete the stimulus more fully, or it will be filled in with default options of the schemas.

'''Axiom 8:''' Sojourners who lack the PSI schemas of the host culture are more likely to employ data-driven processing, which requires effort and attention.

'''Axiom 9:''' In the host culture, sojourners encounter truly novel situations where they experience [[cognitive]] [[uncertainty]] and [[anxiety]] because of the lack of the PSI schemas in the situations.

'''Axiom 10:''' In the host culture, sojourners experience the stages of self-regulation and self-direction. In the stage of self-regulation, they try to resolve ambiguities and to establish integration of information using their native-culture schemas by gradually modifying them. In the stage of self-direction, on the other hand, they actively try to reorganize their native [[culture]] schemas or to generate host culture schemas in order to adapt to the host-culture environment.

=== Real-world example – a sojourner's experience ===
As discussed above, [[:wikt:sojourner|sojourner]]s are people who live in a culture other than their own with the intent of one day returning home. For sojourner Gillian Gibbons' situation, the cultural schema theory is highly applicable. Ms. Gibbons, a [[United Kingdom|British]] [[school teacher]], left [[Liverpool, England]] in August 2007 to teach a group of six- and seven-year-olds at Unity School in [[Khartoum, Sudan]]. Shortly after her arrival, Ms. Gibbons class was due to study the habitat and behavior of bears. Upon her request, a student brought in a [[teddy bear]] to serve as a case study. Students were invited to vote on a name for the bear. After considering the names [[Abdullah (name)|Abdullah]] and [[Hassan (name)|Hassan]], 20 of the 23 children voted in favor of the name [[Muhammad]]. What seemed like a harmless children's learning tool took a turn for the worse on November 25, 2007, when Ms. Gibbons was arrested at her home inside the school premises; Sudanese police claimed a number of parents complained to Sudan's [[Ministry of Education (Sudan)|Ministry of Education]] about the bear. Charges against Ms. Gibbons were prepared under article 125 of Sudanese [[criminal law]] which covers insults against faith and religions.  Ms Gibbons' particular crime: insulting Islam's [[Prophet Muhammad]]. In [[Islam]], insulting the [[Prophet Muhammad]] is considered a grave offense.  Ms. Gibbons' was held in a [[Khartoum]] jail facing a maximum penalty of 40 lashes and 6 months in jail. Ms. Gibbons was found guilty of insulting Islam and sentenced to 15 days in jail and deportation from Sudan after her release. Sudanese President [[Omar al-Bashir]] granted her a pardon after she served nine days in jail due to pressure from the British government. She immediately returned to [[England]] upon her release. While colleagues, friends, and family regarded the whole situation as a misunderstanding, many local Sudanese disagreed. Hundreds of protestors gathered outside of the presidential palace to denounce Ms. Gibbons. Some protestors waved ceremonial swords, some voiced anger at the Sudanese government for not treating her more severely, some distributed leaflets which condemned her as an infidel and accused her of polluting children's mentality by her actions. At the edge of extreme were those who called for her execution (BBC News, 2007; CNN, 2007; New York Times, 2007; TIME, 2007; Times Online, 2007). This highly publicized incident can be explained quite well by the cultural schema theory, particularly by discussing Ms. Gibbons' status as a sojourner in an unfamiliar culture. Axiom number three and axiom number nine apply quite well to Ms. Gibbons. As a sojourner, the acquisition of host [[culture]] PSI schemas would be necessary in order for the sojourner's cross-cultural adaptation to occur. Ms. Gibbons may have lived in Sudan, but she lived inside the walls of Unity School. According to [[BBC News]] (2007), once inside the walls of Unity School one would think s/he was at standing on the grounds of an Oxbridge University. This private school with children of well-to-do parents is much different than the rest of Sudan. Ms. Gibbons did not need to acquire the PSI schemas of the host culture because her native PSI schemas worked equally well inside the walls of Unity School. Had Ms. Gibbons been constantly made aware of the local PSI schemas (naming an animal after the [[Prophet Muhammad]] is unacceptable) she may have adapted and not allowed the children to name the teddy bear Muhammad. Naming a teddy bear was not a novel situation to her as a children's school teacher, but she was not in England. After the bear's naming she certainly encountered a novel situation where she experienced cognitive uncertainty and anxiety because of her lack of the PSI schemas in the situation. Hence the difficulties of cross-cultural adaptation for sojourners like Ms. Gibbons. They do not intend to stay and thus will not adapt/experience the stages of axioms which will best prepare them to appropriately fit in.

== Contrasting theory ==
Cultural Schema Theory is often compared and contrasted with the [[Cultural consensus theory|Cultural Consensus Theory]]. Both theories present distinct perspectives about the nature of individual and cultural knowledge. However, unlike the Cultural Schema Theory, the Cultural Consensus Theory helps to describe and mathematically measure the extent to which cultural beliefs are shared. The central idea is the use of the pattern of agreement or consensus among members of the same culture.  Essentially, the more knowledge people have, the more consensus is observed among them. Unfortunately, the Cultural Consensus Theory does not help others to better understand [[intracultural]] variability or how cultural knowledge is interrelated at a cognitive level. Cultural Consensus Theory anticipates intracultural variation but views variation as analogous to performance on a cultural test, with certain individuals functioning as better guides than others to the cultural information pool (Garro, 2000).

== Further use and development of the theory ==
Simply put, cultural schema theory can be described as cultural-specific world knowledge (Razi, 2002). As mentioned above, the concept of Cultural Schemas is not new, but the theory is.  Future studies must generate theorems and further tests must be conducted in order to better formulate theory itself and the axioms it proposes. Once this is complete the theory can be used in cross-cultural training purposes in order to facilitate individuals' adaptation to their respective host-culture environments (Nishida, 1999). There has been efforts to make this task done. For example, Ehsan Shahghasemi and [[D. Ray Heisey]] (2009) introduce the notion of "cross cultual schemata" as "abstract mental structures that one makes according to his/her past experiences or shared knowledge about the members of other cultures and thus makes them more understandable."&lt;ref&gt;http://www.uri.edu/iaics/content/2009v18n1/10%20Ehsan%20Shaghasemi%20&amp;%20D.%20Ray%20Heisey.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''DBCult Film Institute''' is an independent [[non-profit organization]] and film foundation created by film and cultural operators. The organization describes itself as "institute of cinematic memory", which aims to collect, preserve films from decay and to transmit future film productions on to [[cult film]] and genre cinema.

[[File:Nameplate DBCult Film Institute.jpg|thumb|Nameplated DBCult Film Institute]]

The Film Institute is located in [[Palermo]], [[Italy]], and operates under cult cinema in order to preserve films, related materials in the most advanced manner possible, protect films from deterioration and neglect while also preserving their cultural aspect and future deliverance.

[[File:DBCult Film Institute Head Office.jpg|thumb|DBCult Film Institute Head Office in Italy]]

Cult cinema has very specific connotations which defines it. Anglo-Saxons define them as ''[[cult films]]'' and surface ''[[b-movies]]'', in [[Italy]] they are called ''cinema di genere'' (genre films), ''cinema bis'' in [[France]], ''cine de culto'' in [[Spain]] and [[South America]], ''filmes do gênero'' in [[Portugal]] and [[Brazil]], ''filme des genres'' in [[Germany]], etc. … but more specifically, characterizing these films with one or more genres since the birth of cinema with the  [[Lumière brothers]] to the 1980s, usually far from the lavish productions. Often playing a key role in their bibliography, home video production and the general trend expressed by millions of media people around the world.

The foundation is managed by goal oriented film scholars, writers and people who work within the [[film industry]]. The film library offers all its cinema operators and associates an extensive archive of film database information, publications and press articles. The study and the interest of the organization is focused primarily on genre film productions, especially [[Horror film]], [[Science Fiction film]], [[Action film]], [[Adventure film]], [[Comedy film]], [[Crime film]], [[Mondo film]], [[Drama film]], [[Fantasy film]], [[Mystery film]], [[Noir film]], [[sword and sandal|Peplum or Sword-and-sandal film]], Sexy, [[Spy film]], [[Thriller (genre)|Thriller film]], [[War film]], [[Western (genre)|Western film]], and related subgenres.

==History==
The '''DBCult Film Institute''' was founded in 2011, replacing the BCult Associazione Culturale, founded in 2003. The organization results from the integration between the old BCult A.C. and their new film and cultural collaborators.

==Activities==
The '''DBCult Film Institute''' is active within seven main areas which are subsidized:
* Restoration and preservation of all films produced before the 1990s.
* Preservation of related material (posters, publications, photos, printed media, soundtracks, etc.)
* Communication of cult movies culture.
* Archives, museum activities.
* Regular public meetings for the use of film festivals and exhibitions.
* Education, offering a range of education initiatives, in particular to support the teaching of film and media studies in schools.
* Maintenance of the Movie Db, Publication Db and Printed Media Db (summaries of information on  movies and related artists), a multi-database which contains credits, synopses and other data on global [[cult film]].

==Archive==

* '''Film'''
The institute stock consists of approximately 62.000 movies on different formats of film and video. For the last 40 years these films have come together from either private collectors and/or other foundations. In particular there are some very important collections of [[Cinema of Italy|Italian]], [[Cinema of France|French]], [[Cinema of the United Kingdom|British]], [[Cinema of Spain|Spanish]], [[Cinema of Germany|German]], [[Cinema of Sweden|Swedish]], [[Cinema of the United States|American]], [[Cinema of Mexico|Mexican]] and [[Cinema of Japan|Japanese]] Cinema, among several other productions from many other countries.

* '''Publication'''
It keeps about 19.605 books, magazines, comic books, photonovels, fanzines etc. … all of which consist of [[cult film|cult movie]] topics and we also have a rough calculation that includes about 2.207.012 photographs and press cuttings.

* '''Graphics Stock'''
Is assembled by a wealth of images on film promotion: some 1.9540.909 documents from posters, lobby cards, pictures and pressbooks.

* '''Music Stock'''
Our music stock is devoted to a collection of 6.048 vinyl records and CDs of movie soundtracks.

'''Dinicu Golescu''' (usual rendition of '''Constantin Radovici Golescu'''; 7 February 1777 &amp;ndash; 5 October 1830), a member of the [[Golescu family]] of [[boyars]], was a [[Wallachia]]n [[Romanians|Romanian]] man of letters, mostly noted for his travel writings and journalism. 

Born in [[Ștefănești, Argeș|Ștefănești]], [[Argeş County]], Dinicu was the son of [[Radu Golescu]]. Together with his older brother George (or Iordache), he studied at the [[Phanariotes|Phanariote]]-founded [[Greek-language|Greek]] Academy in [[Bucharest]]. 

In 1804, he married Zoe Farfara (?&amp;ndash;1879), with whom he had five children: Ana (1805&amp;ndash;1878), [[Ştefan Golescu|Ştefan]] (1809&amp;ndash;1874), [[Nicolae Golescu|Nicolae]] (1810&amp;ndash;1877), [[Radu Golescu|Radu]] (1814&amp;ndash;1882), and [[Alexandru Golescu Albu]] (1818&amp;ndash;1873). All of his sons were to play prominent parts in the [[Wallachian Revolution of 1848]] and in the politics of [[Romania]], as would his nephew, [[Alexandru G. Golescu|Alexandru Golescu Negru]]

In 1826, he published an account of his travels through [[Europe]], ''[[Însemnarea călătoriei mele]]'' ("Account of My Travel"), which is the first travelogue of a Romanian in Western Europe.&lt;ref&gt;Al. ''Piru, Istoria literaturii române'', Ed. Grai și suflet-Cultura națională, București. 1994, p. 34&lt;/ref&gt; He uses his [[Travel literature|travelogue]] to study the administration and production systems in various countries, which he describes and recommends through comparisons with the situation at home. The text contains a plea for a general reform of domestic institutions in a "European" direction (based on [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]] ideas). Viewing European culture as more advanced, he managed, despite his middle age and the considerable difficulties he had in expressing himself, to convey a message of change. His travel journal had a great influence on the Romanian [[intelligentsia]] of the time.  

One of the founding members of the Bucharest Literary Society (1827), Golescu contributed to the issuing of the first [[Romanian language|Romanian-language]] newspaper to be published outside the country, ''Fama Lipschii pentru Daţia'' (1827, [[Leipzig]]; its title translated as "The Fame of Leipzig for [[Dacia]]"). He also helped [[Ion Heliade Rădulescu]] launch ''[[Curierul Românesc]]'', on 8 April 1829. 

Dinicu Golescu died in Bucharest. His [[epitaph]], written by Rădulescu, was published on 9 October 1830 in ''Curierul''; it reads:
&lt;blockquote&gt;"Tu ai dispărut, scrierile tale îţi vor supravieţui, şi numele tău va rămîne scump ştiinţei precum şi celor ce se adapă de la izvoarele tale." ("You have vanished, [but] your writings will have outlived you, and your name shall remain treasured by science and by those who drink from the same sources as you.")&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Bucharest's [[Gara de Nord]] was built on land owned by Dinicu Golescu. A nearby park and boulevard currently bear his name.

''Elfland Catacombs'' is one of the earliest examples of [[hypertext fiction]]{{Citation needed|date=October 2009}} . It was published by Winterhearth company in 1981{{Citation needed|date=August 2007}}, several years before [[Michael Joyce (writer)|Michael Joyce]]'s ''[[Afternoon, a story]]'' (which is generally thought to be "the first hypertext fiction"). Author Alan Lance Andersen created ''Elfland Catacombs'' as a children's fantasy adventure, using the [[Commodore BASIC]] computer language. The plot involved the reader visiting an aunt in the border country of Scotland and becoming lost after crossing into Elfland with the help of an elf named Jennings. Numerous plot paths led to different endings — some happy and others not quite so pleasant. Unlike the many computer game style adventures of the period, this was a true electronic storybook with hypertextual links. Paul Jordan Hollander later converted it from the obsolete Commodore Basic into HTML files. 
Whatever its literary or technological merits may have been, "Elfland Catacombs" had little or no influence on the development of hypertext fiction. It was distributed on 5" floppy disk in Central Iowa; indeed, it appears to have been almost entirely forgotten outside of Iowa. It is not mentioned in Bolter and Joyce's seminal Hypertext 87 essay on "Hypertext and Creative Writing", nor in Ted Nelson's _Literary Machines_, George P. Landow's _Hypertext: The Convergence of Contemporary Literary Criticism and Technology_, nor in J. Yellowlees' Douglas 1991 doctoral dissertaion on hypertext fiction .  It has never been cited in the Proceedings of the ACM Hypertext Conference.  In contrast, Joyce's [[Afternoon, a story]] has been the subject of numerous reviews, essays, studies, and dissertations.

'''Evolutionary Phonology''' is an approach to [[phonology]] and [[historical linguistics]], based on the idea that recurrent synchronic sound patterns, if not inherited from the mother tongue, are the result of recurrent sound changes, while rare patterns are the product of rare changes or a combination of independent changes.&lt;ref&gt;Blevins 2004:xi.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Gatekeeping''' is the process of controlling the rate at which students progress to more advanced levels of study in the academic setting.  The term can also be more widely applied to refer to the social structures which test individuals for a certain level of understanding before allowing them to perform certain social functions (e.g. [[medical education]] to become a [[Physician|medical doctor]]).

The '''Hetoimasia''', '''Etimasia''' (Greek ἑτοιμασία, "preparation"), '''prepared throne''', '''Preparation of the Throne''', '''ready throne''' or '''Throne of the Second Coming''' is the Christian version of the symbolic subject of the '''empty throne''' found in the art of the ancient world, whose meaning has changed over the centuries.  In [[Ancient Greece]] it represented [[Zeus]], chief of the gods, and in early [[Buddhist art]] it represented [[Gautama Buddha|the Buddha]].  In [[Early Christian art]] and Early [[Medieval art]] it is found in both the East and Western churches, and represents either [[Christ]], or sometimes [[God the Father]] as part of the [[Trinity]].  In the Middle Byzantine period, from about 1000, it came to represent more specifically the throne prepared for the [[Second Coming]] of Christ, a meaning it has retained in [[Eastern Orthodox]] art to the present.&lt;ref&gt;Schiller, II, 186.&lt;/ref&gt;  The motif consists of an empty [[throne]] and various other symbolic objects, in later depictions surrounded when space allows by angels paying homage.  It is usually placed centrally in schemes of composition, very often in a [[roundel]], but typically is not the largest element in a scheme of decoration.&lt;ref&gt;Hall, 94&lt;/ref&gt;

==The empty throne in pre-Christian art==
[[File:MaraAssault.jpg|thumb|left|200px|Buddhist 2nd century empty throne, attacked by [[Mara (demon)|Mara]].&lt;ref&gt;Krishan, pp. 1 and 5, fig 4a caption&lt;/ref&gt;]]
[[File:Prestol ugotovanny.jpg|thumb|200px|left|On the reverse of a Russian icon, with [[instruments of the Passion]].]]
The "empty throne" had a long pre-Christian history.  An [[Assyrian Empire|Assyrian]] relief in Berlin of c. 1243 BCE shows King [[Tukulti-Ninurta I]] kneeling before the empty throne of the fire-god [[Nusku]], occupied by what appears to be a flame.&lt;ref&gt;[http://arttattler.com/archivebeyondbabylon.html Berlin relief]&lt;/ref&gt;  The [[Hittites]] put thrones in important shrines for the spirit of the dead person to occupy, and the [[Etruscans]] left an empty seat at the head of the table at religious feasts for the god to join the company.&lt;ref&gt;Hall, 95&lt;/ref&gt;  A somewhat controversial theory, held by many specialists, sees the [[Israelite]] [[Ark of the Covenant]], or the figures of the [[cherubim]] above it, as an empty throne.&lt;ref&gt;Haran, 247-249, and later in the chapter. See his notes for further literature&lt;/ref&gt;    A throne with a crown upon it had been a symbol for an absent monarch in Ancient Greek culture since at least the time of [[Alexander the Great]],&lt;ref&gt;Syndicus, 151&lt;/ref&gt; whose deification allowed secular use for what had previously been a symbol for Zeus, where the attribute placed on the throne was a pair of zig-zag thunderbolts.&lt;ref&gt;Hall, 95, [http://www.wildwinds.com/coins/greece/cilicia/olba/SNGLev_645.jpg coin 1st century CE] from [[Cilicia]]&lt;/ref&gt; Early [[Buddhist art]] used an empty throne, often under a [[parasol]] or [[Bodhi Tree]], from before the time of Christ.  This was, in the traditional view, an [[aniconism|aniconic]] symbol for the Buddha; they [[Aniconism in Buddhism|avoided depicting]] the Buddha in human form, [[God the Father in Western art|like early Christians with God the Father]].  Alternatively, it has been argued that these images represent actual [[cetiya|relic-thrones]] at the major pilgrimage sites which were objects of worship.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.vam.ac.uk/content/articles/b/buddhist-sculpture-v-and-a/ Example from the V&amp;A museum].  The alternative theory, first advanced by Huntington (see her final paragraph), sees these images as depictions of an actual relic-throne of the Buddha as an object of worship at major Buddhist sites, but this [[Aniconism in Buddhism|remains controversial]].&lt;/ref&gt;  The throne often contains a symbol such as the [[dharma wheel]] or [[Buddha footprint]], as well as a cushion.

Like the Greeks and other ancient peoples, the Romans held ritual banquets for the gods (a ritualized "[[theoxenia]]"), including the annual [[Epulum Jovis]], and the [[lectisternium]], originally a rare event in times of crisis, first held in 399 BCE according to [[Livy]], but later much more common.&lt;ref&gt;Ramsay, 344&lt;/ref&gt;  A seat for these was called a ''pulvinar'', from ''pulvinus'' ("cushion"), and many temples held these; at the banquets statues of the deity were placed on them.  There was a pulvinar at the [[Circus Maximus]], on which initially statues and attributes of the gods were placed after a procession during games, but [[Augustus]] also occupied it himself (possibly copying [[Julius Caesar]]), building a temple-like structure in the seating to house it.&lt;ref&gt;Humphrey, 78-80&lt;/ref&gt;   Thrones with a jewelled wreath, portrait or [[sceptre]] and [[diadem]] sitting on them were among the symbols used in the Roman law courts and elsewhere to represent the authority of the absent emperor; this was one of the monarchical attributes awarded by the [[Roman Senate]] to Julius Caesar.&lt;ref&gt;Humphrey, 79; Hall, 95; Hellemo, 107; [https://books.google.com/books?id=4II_mqxM8s0C&amp;pg=PA62&amp;dq=pulvinar+temple&amp;cd=4#v=onepage&amp;q=pulvinar%20temple&amp;f=false Fishwick]. See Temple 10, note 12 for detailed studies&lt;/ref&gt;  A seat with jewelled wreath is seen on coins from the [[Emperor Titus]] onwards, and on those of [[Diocletian]] a seat with a helmet on it represents [[Mars (mythology)|Mars]].&lt;ref&gt;Hellemo, 107&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Commodus]] chose to be represented by a seat with the club and lion skin of [[Hercules]], with whom he identified himself.  The empty throne continued to be used as a secular symbol of power by the first Christian Emperors, and appears on the [[Arch of Constantine]].

Later non-Christian uses of the empty throne motif include the "Bema Feast", the most important annual feast of Persian [[Manichaeism]], when a "bema" or empty throne represented the [[Mani (prophet)|prophet Mani]] at a meal for worshippers.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=y7IHmyKcPtYC&amp;pg=PA986&amp;dq=Bema+feast+mani+empty+throne&amp;lr=&amp;as_brr=3&amp;cd=5#v=onepage&amp;q=Bema%20feast%20mani%20empty%20throne&amp;f=false The Cambridge history of Iran: The Seleucid, Parthian and Sasanian periods]&lt;/ref&gt;    In the [[Bali]]nese version of [[Hinduism]], the most prominent element in most temples is the ''padmasana'' or "Lotus Throne", an empty throne for the supreme deity [[Acintya]].&lt;ref&gt;Davison and Granquist, 8-9, [http://www.baliblog.com/travel-tips/bali-travel/padmasana-the-lotus-throne.html Baliblog, with images]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Christian art==
[[File:Poze Lucianiene 225.jpg|thumb|Modern depiction in a [[Romanian Orthodox]] church, with crown of thorns around the cross.]]
There are several elements found in the image which reflect its changing meaning.  The throne itself is always present, and is often backless and armless.  In Ancient Greek, a "thronos" was a specific but ordinary type of chair with a footstool, and there is very often a footstool in the image.   There is often a prominent cushion, and a cloth variously interpreted as Christ's mantle (especially when of imperial purple) or a [[sudarium]] may cover or sit on the throne.&lt;ref&gt;Schiller, I, 132&lt;/ref&gt; There may be a crown on the throne. There is often a book, often on the cushion and sometimes open; this represents the gospels in some examples, and in others the [[Book of Life]], always closed and distinguished by its seven seals, following the [[Book of Revelation|Book of Apocalypse]].  There is nearly always a cross (except in images of councils), often a [[crux gemmata]], and in later examples a [[patriarchal cross]] with two crossbars.  The cloth may be draped round the cross, as may the [[Crown of Thorns|crown of thorns]], which first appears as an isolated motif in this context.&lt;ref&gt;Schiller, II, 187, noting the exception of a single occurrence in the [[Utrecht Psalter]].&lt;/ref&gt;  This seems to have originated as a victor's wreath around or over the cross, part of the early emphasis on "Christ as Victor" found in much cross imagery, but later to have been transmuted into the crown of thorns.  It has also been suggested that the wreathed cross motif also was the origin of the [[Celtic cross]].

The dove of the [[Holy Spirit]] may be present.  In later versions two of the [[instruments of the Passion]], the [[Holy Lance|Spear]] and sponge on a stick, stand behind or beside the throne, or are held by angels. The nails from the cross and crown of thorns may sit on the throne, as in the Russian icon illustrated. If angels or archangels are included they are symmetrically placed on either side, either facing the throne or facing out and gesturing towards it; if there is a roundel they may be outside it.  In earlier depictions other figures may surround the throne, for example Saints [[Saint Peter|Peter]] and [[Saint Paul|Paul]] in [[Santa Prassede]], Rome (9th century). An alternative to the angels is kneeling figures of [[Adam and Eve]] in old age paying homage on either side of the throne.  These are found in several large wall-paintings and [[mosaic]]s, from the 12th century mosaics in [[Torcello Cathedral]],&lt;ref&gt;Hall, 94, where both are illustrated, and 141&lt;/ref&gt; the paintings in the [[Chora Church]], and the painted church exterior at [[Voroneţ Monastery]] in [[Romania]] of 1547.&lt;ref&gt;[http://fotopoeziemuzica.wordpress.com/2008/04/30/voronet-2-pictura/ Voroneţ Monastery, feature with good image] (in Romanian)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Meaning of the image==
[[File:CouncilOfConstantinople381BnFMSGr510.jpg|thumb|left|Byzantine miniature of about 880 of the [[First Council of Constantinople]] in 381]]

The image was one of many aspects of imperial [[iconography]] taken up by Early Christians after the [[Edict of Milan]] in 313, when the [[depiction of Jesus]] as a human figure, especially as a large figure detached from narrative contexts, was still a matter of controversy within Christianity.  At the [[First Council of Nicaea]] in 325 an empty throne had the imperial insignia on it, representing the emperor [[Constantine I]] when he was not present.&lt;ref&gt;Hall, 95&lt;/ref&gt;  However within a few decades an empty throne with a book of the [[gospels]] on it was being placed in the chamber of church councils to represent Christ, as at the [[First Council of Ephesus]] in 431.  It has been suggested that the [[ivory]] [[Throne of Maximian]] in [[Ravenna]], probably a gift from the Eastern Emperor [[Justinian I]], was not made as a throne for personal use by [[Maximianus of Ravenna|Maximian]], who was both [[Archbishop of Ravenna]] and the viceroy of the Byzantine territories in North Italy, but as an empty throne to symbolize either the imperial or divine power; Byzantine imagery at this period was sometimes ready to conflate the two.&lt;ref&gt;Beckwith, 116-118&lt;/ref&gt;  A comparable symbol is the [[bishop's throne]] from which the [[cathedral]] takes its name, which, unless the bishop happens to be present and sitting in it, functions as a permanent reminder of his authority in his [[diocese]].

In the earlier versions the throne is most often accompanied by a cross and a scroll or book, which at this stage represents the Gospels.  In this form the whole image represents Christ, but when the dove of the Holy Spirit and the cross are seen, the throne appears to represent God the Father, and the whole image the [[Trinity]], a subject that Christian art did not represent directly for several centuries, as showing the [[God the Father in Western art|Father as a human figure]] was objectionable.  An example of a Trinitarian ''hetoimasia'' is in the Church of the [[Dormition]] in [[Nicaea]].&lt;ref&gt;Parani, 196&lt;/ref&gt;  From about 1000 the image may bear the title ''hetoimasia'',&lt;ref&gt;Parani, 196&lt;/ref&gt; literally "preparation", meaning "that which has been prepared" or "that which is made ready", and specifically refers to the "sign of the Son of Man" and the Last Judgement.  By this time the image usually occurs in the West only under direct Byzantine influence, as in Venice and Torcello.

Some Early Christians had believed that the True Cross had miraculously ascended to Heaven, where it remained in readiness to become the glorified "sign of the Son of man" (see below) at the Last Judgement.  The Discovery by Helena had displaced this view as to the fate of the actual cross, but the idea of the return at the Last Judgement of the glorified cross remained, as in a [[homily]] by Pope [[Leo the Great]] (d. 461), which was incorporated in the [[Roman Breviary]].&lt;ref&gt;Werner, 35 and note 42&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early examples==
[[File:Hetimasia warrior saints Louvre OA11152.jpg|thumb|250px|[[Icon]] in ivory, with archangels, cross, spear and sponge, and "Hetoimasia" inscribed above the throne, [[Constantinople]] around 1000]]
Although it is assumed that other examples existed earlier, the earliest surviving Christian ''hetoimasia'' is in the earliest major scheme of church decoration to survive, the mosaics in [[Basilica of Santa Maria Maggiore|Santa Maria Maggiore, Rome]] (432-40), where it occupies the narrow centre of the "triumphal arch" separating nave and [[apse]], flanked by angels,&lt;ref&gt;Beckwith, 111, and 37 on date&lt;/ref&gt; a typical placement.  It is shown, with a procession of Apostles, on a panel of the [[Pula|Pola]] ivory casket from [[Istria]].&lt;ref&gt;Soper, 154-157&lt;/ref&gt;  Three now displaced stone reliefs of the subject with other symbols are among the earliest indications of Christian architectural sculpture at this period; they are in Berlin, [[San Marco, Venice]] and [[Nicosia, Cyprus]].&lt;ref&gt;Margaret Mullett, et al. "Early Christian and Byzantine art." In [[Grove Art]] Online. Oxford Art Online, [http://www.oxfordartonline.com/subscriber/article/grove/art/T024432pg4 subscription or library access required] (accessed November 8, 2010).&lt;/ref&gt; Elsewhere it may occupy the centre of a frieze below a larger composition in the apse [[semi-dome]], or a position on the main axis of a circular frieze round a central scene in the roof of a dome, as in the [[Arian Baptistry]] (start of 6th century) in Ravenna.  At [[Castelseprio]] it occupies the centre of the apse-side (west-facing) of the triumphal arch. All are central positions, prominent but not dominant.  The [[Baptistry of Neon]] (late 5th century) in Ravenna is exceptional in using repeated ''hetoimasia'' images in a circular dome frieze of eight images, four each of two types appearing alternately: a hetoimasia with cross in a garden and an altar containing an open book, flanked by two chairs.&lt;ref&gt;Morgan, 8. It is also known as the Orthodox Baptistry. See also [https://web.archive.org/web/20061231221154/http://www.tau.ac.il/arts/publications/assaph%209/Weinryb%2041-58.pdf Weinryb], 44, 48-51.&lt;/ref&gt;

The 6th-century "throne-reliquary" in rather crudely carved [[alabaster]], the ''Sedia di San Marco'', was moved from the high altar to the Treasury of [[San Marco, Venice]] in 1534.  It would only fit a bishop with a slight figure, and has a large compartment for relics below the seat. It may have functioned as a "throne-lectern" or resting place for a [[gospel book]], making actual the hetoimasia images with open books.&lt;ref&gt;Buckton, 98-105&lt;/ref&gt;

==Later use==
During the Middle Byzantine period the etimasia became a standard feature of the evolving subject of the [[Last Judgement]], found from the 11th century onwards.&lt;ref&gt;[[V&amp;A Museum]], notes on ivory Last Judgement [https://collections.vam.ac.uk/item/O94171/figure-the-last-judgement/]&lt;/ref&gt;  As in the Western versions descended from the Byzantine images, this was on several tiers, with Christ in Judgement at the top, and in the East the etimasia almost always in the centre of the tier below, but occasionally above Christ.  This basic layout has remained in use in [[Eastern Orthodoxy]] to the present day, and is found both on church walls and as a painted panel icon. The etimasia was normally omitted in Western versions, except in works under direct Byzantine influence, such as the early 12th century west wall of [[Torcello Cathedral]]. 
[[File:Last Judgment (Russia) 001.jpg|thumb|left|Russian 18th(?) century icon of the [[Last Judgement]], following what had become a standard composition in its main elements, including the etimasia.]]

Another context in which the etimasia sometimes appears from the Middle Byzantine period is [[Pentecost]], in Orthodoxy also the Feast of the Trinity.  Here a trinitarian etimasia with the dove representing the Holy Spirit may be found, as in the 12th century mosaics on the roof of the west dome of [[St Mark's, Venice]], where the centre is an etimasia with book and dove, with the [[twelve apostles]] seated round the outer rims, with flames on their heads and rays connecting them to the central throne.  Below the apostles pairs of figures representing the "nations", with ''tituli'', stand between the windows.  Similar images are found in the [[Chludov Psalter]] and elsewhere.  However, in this case the etimasia did not become part of a conventional composition, and it is not found in modern icons of the Pentecost.&lt;ref&gt;Demus, 55-57, and plate 13; also Parani, 196. See [https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=LAUMM3cU_UoC&amp;lpg=RA1-PA240&amp;ots=hD-45Z7Svh&amp;dq=Hetoimasia%20Hagia%20Sophia&amp;pg=RA1-PA241#v=onepage&amp;q=Hetoimasia%20Hagia%20Sophia&amp;f=false here] for further details]&lt;/ref&gt;

It has been suggested that the empty stool with a cushion in the foreground of [[Jan van Eyck]]'s [[Annunciation (van Eyck, Washington)|''Annunciation'' in Washington]] may suggest the empty throne; van Eyck characteristically uses domestic fittings to represent doctrinal references.&lt;ref&gt;Hand, J.O., &amp; Wolff, M., ''Early Netherlandish Painting'' (catalogue), National Gallery of Art, p. 81 and note 27, Washington/Cambridge UP, 1986, {{ISBN|0-521-34016-0}}. Entry pp. 75-86, by Hand.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Scriptural references==
The image has been regarded as illustrating a number of different passages from the Bible. For the later Byzantines the ''etimasia'' was the "sign of the [[Son of man]]" of Matthew 24:30:
"And then shall appear the sign of the Son of man in heaven: and then shall all the tribes of the earth mourn, and they shall see the Son of man coming in the clouds of heaven with power and great glory".&lt;ref&gt;See Hellemo, 102-104 for arguments that the earliest examples also carried this meaning (he disagrees)&lt;/ref&gt;  The understanding of the image as a symbol for the Second Coming also drew on [[Psalms]] 9:7: "But the Lord shall endure for ever: he hath prepared his throne for judgment".&lt;ref&gt;Schiller, II 98 &amp; 187&lt;/ref&gt; where the [[Septuagint]] has "ἡτοίμασεν" ("hetoimasen") for "prepared".&lt;ref&gt;Psalms 9:7: καὶ ὁ κύριος εἰς τὸν αἰῶνα μένει ἡτοίμασεν ἐν κρίσει τὸν θρόνον αὐτοῦ [http://mlbible.com/psalms/9-7.htm Biblos website]&lt;/ref&gt; Psalm 89:14:"Justice and judgment are the habitation of thy throne: mercy and truth shall go before thy face" is another relevant passage, using the word in the Septuagint (instead of the "habitation" of the [[King James Version]]), giving "ἑτοιμασία τοῦ θρόνου" or "preparation of your throne".&lt;ref&gt;Temple, 8-9, [http://mlbible.com/psalms/89-14.htm Biblos website]&lt;/ref&gt;  Throne imagery is found above all in the [[Book of Revelation]], especially chapter 4, although the throne therein is already occupied.

==Terminology==
The Greek verb ἑτοιμασεν ("hetoimasen") means "to prepare" or "to make ready". It will be seen  that the name "hetoimasia", meaning "preparation" or "that which has been prepared", with "throne" ("thronos" in Greek) only implied,&lt;ref&gt;Contrary to many sources who should know better, and say hetoimasia "means" empty throne etc.&lt;/ref&gt; is more appropriate to the Eastern images after about 1000 than to those before.  The use of the name for both groups was established in the 19th century by the French art historian Paul Durand (from 1867), and despite protests has stuck.&lt;ref&gt;Hellemo, 104-105&lt;/ref&gt;  In more modern Orthodox contexts "etimasia" and "prepared throne" are typically used, and in art history relating to the earlier group "hetoimasia" and "empty throne" - exclusively the latter in non-Christian contexts where a more specialized term is not used.  There are various other transliterations and translations: "hetimasia", "throne made ready" etc.

The '''''hsaing waing''''' ({{lang-my|ဆိုင်းဝိုင်း}}, {{IPA-my|sʰáiɴ wáiɴ|pron}}; also spelt '''''saing waing''''') is a traditional Burmese folk [[musical ensemble]], consisting of a number of different [[gong]]s and [[drum]]s, as well as other instruments, depending on the nature of the performance. These include the ''[[hne]]'' (a double reed pipe), ''[[pat waing]]'' (a set of 21 drums in a circle), ''kyi waing'' (small bronze gongs in a circular frame), ''maung hsaing'' (larger bronze gongs in a rectangular frame), as well as ''chauk lon pat'' (a set of 8 tuned drums), and ''si'' and ''wa'' (bell and clapper).&lt;ref name="gar"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Garifas |first=Robert |year=1985 |title=The Development of the Modern Burmese Hsaing Ensemble |journal=Asian Music |volume=16 |issue=1 |pages=1–28 |jstor=834011|doi=10.2307/834011 |publisher=University of Texas Press }}&lt;/ref&gt; For more formal and classical performances, the ensemble may be accompanied by the ''[[saung gauk]]'', the Burmese harp, the ''[[pattala]]'', a Burmese xylophone, or the [[piano]] and [[violin]], both introduced during colonial rule. ''Hsaing waing'' musicians use a [[Pentatonic scale|hemitonic and anhemitonic scale]] similar to the one used by Indonesian [[gamelan]] musicians.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=World Musics in Context: A Comprehensive Survey of the World's Major Musical Cultures |last=Fletcher |first=Peter |author2=Laurence Picken |year=2004 |publisher=Oxford University Press |location= |isbn=978-0-19-517507-3 |pages=312–313}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Music of the ''hsaing waing'' is characterized by its lively and sudden contrasts and shifts in rhythm, melody and tempo.&lt;ref name="as"&gt;http://asiasociety.org/arts-culture/performing-arts/music/burmese-hsaing-and-anyein?page=0,0&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.nytimes.com/2003/12/15/arts/music/15MYAN.html | work=The New York Times | first=Jon | last=Pareles | title=WORLD MUSIC REVIEW; From Myanmar, Sounds That Surprise | date=2003-12-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Anyeint]]'' dance performances, as well as [[Nat (spirit)|nat gadaw]] and [[marionette]] puppet performances, are accompanied by the music of the ''hsaing waing'', with the sudden shifts in musical rhythm reflected in the dancer's changing poses.&lt;ref name="as"/&gt; However, classical singing, derived from royal chamber music, is almost exclusively accompanied by either a classical ensemble or a single ''saung gauk''. 

Although the origins of the ''hsaing waing'' are unclear, the earliest pictoral evidence dates to the 17th century, coinciding with the Burmese invasion of the [[Ayutthaya Kingdom]], which may have brought back the concept of the gong and drum ensemble, although the ''hsaing waing'' differs greatly in its diversity of instruments and musical style from Thai ensembles.&lt;ref name="gar"/&gt;

'''Humanistic Informatics''' (also known as '''Humanities informatics''') is one of several names chosen for the study of the relationship between [[human culture]] and [[technology]]. The term is fairly common in [[Europe]], but is little known in the [[English-speaking world]], though [[Digital Humanities]] (also known as '''Humanities computing''') is in many cases roughly equivalent. 

Humanistic informatics departments were generally started in the 1990s when universities rarely taught humanities-based approaches to the rapidly developing computerized society. For this reason, the field was quite broadly defined, and included courses in humanities computing, basic introductions to how computers work, historical developments of technology, technology and learning, digital art and literature and digital culture. Today several departments have declared more specialized areas of research, such as digital arts and culture at the [[University of Bergen]], and socio-cultural communication with and without technology at the [[University of Aalborg]].

Digital Humanities is a primary topic, and there are several universities in the US and the UK that have Digital Arts and Humanities research and development centers. One aspect of Digital Humanities that will grow will be the intersection of new digital media and the humanities, particularly in the gaming industry which has developed both casual and serious gaming and game design strategies to foster learning in the humanities and all other academic disciplines. A key principle in all digital interactive media or games is the storyline; the narrative or quest or goal of the game is primary to both literary works and games. Characters and players go on the quest, and playing the game becomes the narrative.  Game design principles, also relevant in literature and the fine arts, include visual literacy and empowering players/learners to align with great artitsts and writers who believe in the creative process.

==Hybridity as racial mixing==
{{Main|Multiracial}}
Hybridity is a cross between two separate races, plants or cultures.&lt;ref&gt;Lusty, Natalya. ''Surrealism, Feminism, Psychoanalysis'' 2007, Ashgate, {{ISBN|978-0-7546-5336-3}}, p. 77.&lt;/ref&gt; A hybrid is something that is mixed, and hybridity is simply mixture. Hybridity is not a new cultural or historical phenomenon. It has been a feature of all civilizations since time immemorial, from the Sumerians through the Egyptians, Greeks and Romans to the present. Both ancient and modern civilizations have, through trade and conquests, borrowed foreign ideas, philosophies, and sciences, thus producing hybrid cultures and societies. The term hybridity itself is not a modern coinage. It was common among the Greeks and Romans.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Questioning Hybridity, Postcolonialism and Globalization|last=Acheraiou|first=Amar|publisher=Palgrave Macmillan|year=2011|isbn=978-0-230-29828-6|location=London|pages=|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Michelini|first=Ann|year=1978|title=HYBRIS and plants|url=|journal=Harvard Studies in Classical Philology|volume=82|pages=35–44|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Latin hybrida or ibrida refers to "the offspring of a tame sow and a wild boar,"&lt;ref&gt;Oxford Dictionnary&lt;/ref&gt; and by extension to the progeny of a Roman man and a non-Roman woman. The word hybridity was in use in English since the early 17th century and gained popular currency in the 19th century. [[Charles Darwin]] used this term in 1837 in reference to his experiments in cross-fertilization in plants. The concept of hybridity was fraught with negative connotations from its incipience. The Greeks and Romans borrowed extensively from other civilizations, the Egyptians and Persians in particular, and creating ''ipso facto'' hybridized cultures, but regarded unfavourably biological hybridity. [[Aristotle]], [[Plato]] and [[Pericles]] were all opposed to racial mixing between Greeks and "barbarians" and viewed biological hybridity as a source of racial degeneration and social disorder. Similarly, within the Roman Empire, which is considered as one of the most multi-ethnic empires, cultural difference was usually integrated into the predominant culture, whereas biological hybridity was condemned.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Invention of Racism in Classical Antiquity|last=Isaac|first=Benjamin|publisher=Princeton University Press|year=2004|isbn=|location=Princeton|pages=|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Romans’ attitudes to racial mixing hardened from the 4th century AD when Rome embraced the Christian faith. This is manifest in the [[Codex Theodosianus]] (AD365) which prohibited marriages between Christians and non-Christians, the Jews in particular, and inflicted death penalty on those who did not obey this law.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Holy Matrimony: A Treatise on the Divine Laws of Marriage|last=Watkins|first=Oscar Daniel|publisher=Percival|year=1895|isbn=|location=Rivington|pages=496|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Contempt for biological hybridity did not end with the fall the Roman Empire, but continued throughout the Middle Ages and well into modern times, reaching a peak in the nineteenth century with the rise of Europe into an unrivalled imperial power. Hybridity and fear of racial degeneration caused by the mixing of Europeans and non-Europeans were major concerns in 19th century colonialist discourse prompted by racist pseudo-scientific discourses found in such works as [[Arthur de Gobineau|Joseph Arthur de Gobineau]]'s ''Essai sur l’inégalité des races'' and [[Ernest Renan|Joseph-Ernest Renan]]'s ''L’Education culturelle et morale''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Questioning Hybridity, Postcolonialism and Globalization|last=Acheraiou|first=Amar|publisher=Palgrave Macmillan|year=2011|isbn=978-0-230-29828-6|location=London|pages=13–83|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As an explicative term, hybridity became a useful tool in forming a fearful discourse of racial mixing that arose toward the end of the 18th century.&lt;ref&gt;Carvalheiro, José. ''Is the Discourse of Hybridity a Celebration of Mixing, or a Reformulation of Racial Division? A Multimodal Analysis of the Portuguese Magazine Afro.'' Forum: Qualitative Social Research [Online], 11.2 (2010)&lt;/ref&gt; Pseudo-scientific models of anatomy and [[craniometry]] were used to argue that Africans, Asians, Native Americans, and Pacific Islanders were racially inferior to Europeans. The fear of [[miscegenation]] that followed responds to the concern that the offspring of racial interbreeding would result in the dilution of the European race. Hybrids were seen as an aberration, worse than the inferior races, a weak and diseased mutation. Hybridity as a concern for racial purity responds clearly to the zeitgeist of colonialism where, despite the backdrop of the humanitarian [[age of enlightenment]], social hierarchy was beyond contention as was the position of Europeans at its summit. The social transformations that followed the ending of colonial mandates, rising immigration, and economic liberalization profoundly altered the use and understanding of the term hybridity.&lt;ref name="RJCY" /&gt;

==Hybridity in post-colonial discourse==
''Hybrid talk'', the rhetoric of hybridity, is fundamentally associated with the emergence of [[Postcolonialism|post-colonial]] discourse and its critiques of [[cultural imperialism]]. It is the second stage in the history of hybridity, characterized by literature and theory that study the effects of mixture (hybridity) upon identity and culture. The principal theorists of hybridity are [[Homi K. Bhabha|Homi Bhabha]], [[Néstor García Canclini]], [[Stuart Hall (cultural theorist)|Stuart Hall]], [[Gayatri Spivak]], and [[Paul Gilroy]], whose works respond to the multi-cultural awareness that emerged in the early 1990s.&lt;ref&gt;Hall, Stuart. ‘New Ethnicities’ in ''‘Race’, Culture and Difference'', James Donald, James, and Ali Rattansi, eds. (London: Sage 1992) pp. 252-259.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the theoretic development of hybridity, the key text is ''The Location of Culture'' (1994), by Homi Bhabha, wherein the [[liminality]] of hybridity is presented as a paradigm of colonial anxiety.&lt;ref name="HB"&gt;Bhabha, Homi K. ''The Location of Culture''. 1994. London: Routledge.&lt;/ref&gt; The principal proposition is the hybridity of colonial identity, which, as a cultural form, made the colonial masters ambivalent, and, as such, altered the [[authority]] of [[Power (philosophy)|power]]; as such, Bhabha's arguments are important to the conceptual discussion of ''hybridity''. Hybridity demonstrates how cultures come to be represented by processes of iteration and translation through which their meanings are vicariously addressed to—through—an Other. This contrasts any "essentialist claims for the inherent authenticity or purity of cultures which, when inscribed in the naturalistic sign of symbolic consciousness frequently become political arguments for the hierarchy and ascendary of powerful cultures." &lt;ref name="HB" /&gt; This also means that the colonial subject takes place, its subaltern position inscribed in that space of iteration. The colonial subject is located in a place of hybridity, its identity formed in a space of iteration and translation by the colonizer. Bhabha emphasizes that "the discriminatory effects of the discourse of cultural colonialism, for instance, do not simply or singly refer to a ‘person’… or to a discrimination between mother culture and alien culture…the reference of discrimination is always to a process of splitting as the condition of subjection: a discrimination between the mother and its bastards, the self and its doubles, where the trace of what is disavowed is not repressed but repeated as something different—a mutation." &lt;ref name="HB" /&gt; Like mimicry, hybridity is a metonymy of presence. Hybridity opens up a space, figuratively speaking, where the construction of a political object that is new, neither the colonizer nor the Other, properly defies our political expectations.  However, like Bhabha's concept of mimicry, hybridity is a doubling, dissembling image of being in at least two places at once. This turn in the effect of hybridity makes the presence of colonist authority no longer immediately visible.

Bhabha includes interpretations of hybridity in postcolonial discourse. One is that he sees hybridity as a strategic reversal of the process domination through disavowal. Hybridity reevaluates the assumption of colonial identity through the repetition of discriminatory identity effects. In this way, hybridity can unsettle the narcissist demands of colonial power, but reforms its identifications in strategies of subversion that turn the gaze of the discriminated back upon the colonist. Therefore, with this interpretation, hybridity represents that ambivalent ‘turn’ of the subject into the anxiety-causing object of "paranoid classification—a disturbing questioning of the images and presences of authority". The hybrid retains the actual semblance of the authoritative symbol but reforms its presence by denying it as the signifier of disfigurement—after the intervention of difference. In turn, mimicry is the effect of hybridity. First, the metonymy of presence supports the authoritarian voyeurism, but then as discrimination turns into the assertion of the hybrid, the sign of authority becomes a mask, a mockery.&lt;ref name="HB" /&gt;

Although the original, theoretic development of hybridity addressed the narratives of cultural imperialism, Bhabha's work also comprehends the cultural politics of the condition of being "a migrant" in the contemporary metropolis. Yet hybridity no longer is solely associated with migrant populations and with border towns, it also applies contextually to the flow of cultures and their interactions.

That critique of cultural imperialist hybridity meant that the rhetoric of hybridity progressed to challenging [[essentialism]], and is applied to sociological theories of [[Identity (social science)|identity]], [[multiculturalism]], and [[racism]]. Moreover, ''polyphony'' is another important element of hybridity theory, by [[Mikhail Bakhtin]], which is applied to hybrid discourses presented in [[folklore]] and [[anthropology]].&lt;ref&gt;Kapchan, Deborah and [[Pauline Turner Strong|Turner Strong, Pauline]], eds. ''Theorizing the Hybrid.'' Special issue, Journal of American Folklore, vol. 112, no. 445 (1999).&lt;/ref&gt;

===Criticism of hybridity theory===
The development of hybridity theory as a discourse of anti-essentialism marked the height of the popularity of academic "hybridity talk". However the usage of hybridity in theory to eliminate essentialist thinking and practices (namely racism) failed as hybridity itself is prone to the same essentialist framework and thus requires definition and placement. A number of arguments have followed in which promoters and detractors argue the uses of hybridity theory. Much of this debate can be criticized as being excessively bogged down in theory and pertaining to some unhelpful quarrels on the direction hybridity should progress e.g. attached to racial theory, post-colonialism, cultural studies, or globalization. Sociologist [[Jan Nederveen Pieterse]] highlights these core arguments in a debate that promotes hybridity.&lt;ref name="Pieterse"&gt;Nederveen Pieterse, Jan, ''Globalization and Culture: global mélange''. 2004, Oxford: Rowman &amp; Littlefield&lt;/ref&gt;

Some on the left, such as cultural theorist John Hutnyk, have criticized hybridity as politically void.&lt;ref name="Hutnyk" /&gt; Others like Aijaz Ahmad, Arif Dirlik, and Benita Parry blame Homi Bhabha for recycling obscure psychoanalytic and postmodern theories of culture and identity. Ahmad criticizes Bhabha for establishing a postcolonial theory which overlooks the material colonial context and post-independence realities of the former colonies. He writes: "Between postcoloniality as it exists in a former colony like India, and postcoloniality as the condition of discourse by such critics as Bhabha, there would appear to be a considerable gap".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Ahmad|first=Aijaz|year=1995|title=The Politics of Literary Postcoloniality|url=|journal=Race and Class|volume=36-3|pages=10|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dirlik follows in a similar vein, stressing the postcolonial theorists’ propensity to flatten out cultural difference under the umbrella term of hybridity: "Africa, Caribbean, South-Asian literatures come from different places and different histories, and not merely different from France, but different from each other. It is this real sort of difference that disappears in postcolonial studies".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Postconial Aura: Third World Criticism in the Age of Global Capitalism|last=Dirlik|first=Arif|publisher=Westview Press|year=1997|isbn=|location=Boulder|pages=ix|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In "Signs of our Time" Benita Parry discusses ''The Location of Culture'' and criticizes the "linguistic turn" in cultural studies,&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Third Text Reader: On Art, Culture and Theory|last=Araeen|first=Rasheed|publisher=Continuum|year=2002|isbn=|location=London|pages=243; 230|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; more particularly, Bhabha's dependence on fuzzy psychoanalytical and linguistic explanations of cultural identities, or what she calls the "autarchy of the signifier".&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; ''In Postcolonial Studies: a materialist critique,'' she further rails against the "linguistic turn" and recommends a materialist postcolonial critique that addresses colonialism's epistemic violence within the wider context of the economic exploitation of the colonized masses by imperial capitalism.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Postcolonial Studies: A Materialist Critique|last=Parry|first=Benita|publisher=Routledge|year=2004|isbn=|location=London|pages=|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

More recently, Amar Acheraiou in ''Questioning Hybridity, Postcolonialism and Globalization'' challenges Bhabha's theory of hybridity on theoretical as well as ideological and historical grounds. He criticizes Bhabha for examining hybridity from a narrow, "synchronic" perspective confined to the 19th century, instead of adopting a "diachronic" view which renders better this concept's historical depth.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; He also reproaches this theorist for stripping the notion of hybridity off its constitutive racial connotations and considers this as an essentialist gesture. According to him, by clearing this concept of its negative biological associations, Bhabha evades the discussion of the problematic issue of race and racism, which should, paradoxically, be a central concern in hybridity theory. He further argues that Bhabha overlooks the fact that there are still today several places across the world where for many biologically hybrids, hybridity or "the third space" often proves "the space of the impossible"&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; rather than a site of cultural and racial emancipation. The new theory of hybridity that Acheraiou develops in this book departs from the strictly "cultural and spatial paradigm" of postcolonial theory, or what he calls "angelic hybridism."&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; It is a broadly historical and multi-layered form of hybridity focused on the nebulous political, economic, and ideological power structures, emancipatory as well as oppressive, which have presided over the discourse and practice of hybridity since the dawn of civilization. He calls this alternative mode of rethinking postcoloniality "a radical ethics of hybridity," which is "global in scope and planetary in aspiration". Furthermore, he stresses that this "resistive planetary hybridity" is not "confined to the migrant, diasporic condition," and has "as many centres of consciousness as geographical points of origin".&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

The next phase in the use of the term has been to see hybridity as a cultural effect of globalization. For example, hybridity is presented by Kraidy as the ‘cultural logic’ of globalization as it "entails that traces of other cultures exist in every culture, thus offering foreign media and marketers transcultural wedges for forging affective links between their commodities and local communities."&lt;ref&gt;Kraidy, Marwan ''Hybridity: or the cultural logic of globalization'' 2005, Philadelphia: Temple, {{ISBN|81-317-1100-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another promoter of hybridity as globalization is [[Jan Nederveen Pieterse]], who asserts hybridity as the [[rhizome (philosophy)|rhizome]] of culture.&lt;ref name="Pieterse" /&gt; He argues that globalization as hybridization opposes views which see the process as homogenizing, modernizing, and westernizing, and that it broadens the empirical history of the concept. However neither of these scholars have reinvigorated the hybridity theory debate in terms of solving its inherent problematics. The term hybridity remains contested precisely because it has resisted the appropriations of numerous discourses despite the fact that it is radically malleable. For example, young Muslims in Indonesia are followers of Islam but have "synthesized" trends from global culture in ways that respect religious tradition.  These include drinking [[Islamic dietary laws|non-alcoholic beer]], using [[Quran|Koranic]] apps on their iPhones, and buying ''[[halal]]'' cosmetics. In anti-Western countries, youth who try to create cultural hybridity through clothing conflict with the traditional views of modesty in their religion. Conflict occurs across generations when older adults clash with youth over youth attempts to change traditions.&lt;ref&gt;[[Néstor García Canclini|García Canclini, Néstor]].  ''Hybrid Cultures''.  Minneapolis: University of Minnesota Press, 1990&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1 = Furlong|first1 = Andy|title = Youth Studies: An introduction|publisher = Routledge|location = USA|isbn = 978-0-415-56479-3|pages = 237–238|edition = 1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Hybridity in linguistics==

=== Linguistic hybridity and colonialism ===
Languages are all hybrid, in varying degrees. For centuries people borrowed from foreign languages, creating thus hybrid linguistic idioms. They did so for commercial, aesthetic, ideological and technological reasons (to facilitate trade transactions, express philosophical or scientific ideas unavailable in their original idioms, enrich and adapt their languages to new realities, subvert a dominant colonial literary canon by deliberately introducing words from the colonized peoples' idiom). Trade and colonization have been the main vehicles of linguistic hybridization across history. Since the classical conquests, both the colonizers and colonized tapped into each other's languages. The Greeks soaked up many mathematical and astronomical concepts from the Egyptians. The Romans, too, absorbed much of Greek culture and ideas. They also drew abundantly from the "barbarians". In ''Taktika'', [[Arrian]] (92–175 AD), a Greek historian and philosopher of the Roman period, drew attention to the Romans' indebtedness to their colonial subjects, arguing that "the Romans have many foreign (Iberian, Celtic) terms for formations, for they used Celtic cavalry".&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; In modern times, the French and British resorted to similar linguistic appropriations throughout their conquests. The French language, for example, contains over 200 Arabic and Berber words, most of which were taken up during France's colonization of Algeria. Similarly, hundreds of Indian words entered the English idiom from the seventeenth to the nineteenth century. According to ''The Oxford English Dictionary,'' 900 English words are of Indian origin. Linguistic hybridity was manifest in these colonial contexts, but was acknowledged by neither the colonizers nor the colonized. More still, while these linguistic borrowings had, de facto, rendered colonial languages hybrid and therefore impure, the myth of linguistic purity and superiority, inherited from the ancient Greeks’ "linguistic racialism",&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; held firmly among the European colonizers. The Greek word ‘barbarian,’ which was used to refer to non-Greek languages’ inferiority, backwardness and inarticulacy, was adopted by the French since the 16th century. It was often applied to the Basque, Breton and Occitan languages and to their speakers. [[Henri Grégoire|Abbé Grégoire]] recommended wiping out these "crude idioms" and forcing French on the Basques, Bretons and Occitans to "spread enlightened ideas (...), well-being and political tranquillity".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Une politique de la langue: La révolution française et le patois, l'enquête et le patois|last=De Certeau|first=Michel|publisher=Gallimard|year=1975|isbn=|location=Paris|pages=21|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to him, this would "banish superstition" and "simplify the mechanism of the political machine." It would, above all, "mould the citizens into a national whole"&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Dominant Languages: Language and Hierarchy in Britain and France|last=Grillo|first=R. D.|publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=1989|isbn=|location=Cambridge|pages=24; 174.|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Britain, this Aristotelian view of language was revitalized by authors like [[Jonathan Swift]], [[Samuel Johnson]], and [[Matthew Arnold]], who cast respectively the Irish, Scots and Welsh as "rude" and "backward", attributing these peoples’ intellectual and economic "backwardness" to their "inferior" languages.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Rethinking Postcolonialism: Colonialist Discourse in Modern Literatures and the Legacy of Classical Writers|last=Acheraiou|first=Amar|publisher=Palgrave Macmillan|year=2008|isbn=0-230-55205-6|location=Basingstoke|pages=|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Linguistic Hybridity: a dual dynamics ===
Linguistic and cultural hybridity is a "dual dynamics" which operates "passively" as well as "actively".&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; [[Mikhail Bakhtin]] distinguished two types of hybridity: "organic" or "unconscious" hybridity and "intentional" hybridity. He defines organic hybridity as an "unintentional, unconscious hybridization" and regards it as "the most important mode in the historical life and evolution of all languages".&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Bakhtin|first=Michael|year=2004|title=Discourse in the Novel (1935)|url=|journal=in Michael Holquist (ed.), The Dialogic Imagination|volume=|pages=259–422|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; "Intentional hybridization" consists of juxtaposing deliberately different idioms, discourses, and perspectives within the same semiotic space without merging them. Bakhtin states that the language of the novel is "a system of languages that mutually and ideologically interanimate each other".&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Bakhtin|first=Michael|year=2004|title=From the Prehistory of Novelistic Discourse (1940)|url=|journal=In Michael Holquist (ed.), The Dialogic Imagination|volume=|pages=41–83|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; He adds: "the novelistic hybrid is an artistically organized system for bringing different languages in contact with one another, a system having as its goal the illumination of one language by another, the carving-out of a living image of another language".&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; Further down, yet, he cautions against drawing clear-cut boundaries between these two forms of hybridity, arguing that the "centripetal" forces inherent in "organic hybridity" are also present in "intentional hybridity," in the same way as the "centrifugal" features of "intentional hybridity" may be at play in "organic hybridity."&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

=== Hybridity and the Tree Model ===
Linguistic hybridity and the case of mixed languages challenge the [[Comparative method|Tree Model]] in [[linguistics]]. For example, "Israeli" (a term for [[Modern Hebrew]]) has been argued to be a Semito-European hybrid language that "demonstrates that the reality of linguistic genesis is far more complex than a simple family tree system allows. 'Revived' languages are unlikely to have a single parent."&lt;ref&gt;Zuckermann, Ghil'ad. '[http://www.zuckermann.org/pdf/Hybridity_versus_Revivability.pdf Hybridity versus Revivability: Multiple Causation, Forms and Patterns]' in ''Journal of Language Contact'', 2009, Varia 2, pp. 40-67.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Hybridity in art==
Presently, human beings are immersed in a hybridised environment of reality and augmented reality on a daily basis, considering the proliferation of physical and digital media (i.e. print books vs. e-books, music downloads vs. physical formats). Many people attend performances intending to place a digital recording device between them and the performers, intentionally "layering a digital reality on top of the real world."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Tsukayama |first=Hayley |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/faster-forward/post/apple-patent-would-stop-iphone-concert-recordings/2011/06/20/AGV7AFdH_blog.html |title=Apple patent would stop iPhone concert recordings |publisher=[[The Washington Post]] |date=21 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; For artists working with and responding to new technologies, the hybridisation of physical and digital elements has become a reflexive reaction to this strange dichotomy.&lt;ref name="DazedConfused"&gt;{{cite web|last=Knight |first=Amy |url=http://www.dazeddigital.com/blog/article/15085/1/hybridity-in-new-art |title=Hybridity in new art |publisher=[[Dazed &amp; Confused (magazine)|Dazed &amp; Confused]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, in ''Rooms'' by Sara Ludy computer-generated effects process physical spaces into abstractions, making familiar environments and items such as carpets, doors and windows disorientating, set to the sound of an industrial hum. In effect, the distinction between real and virtual space in [[art]] is deconstructed.&lt;ref name="DazedConfused" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.triangulationblog.com/2012/02/rooms-by-sara-ludy.html ''Rooms'' by Sara Ludy TRIANGULATION BLOG]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://muse.jhu.edu/journals/film_history/summary/v019/19.2donato.html Docufictions: an interview with Martin Scorsese on documentary film] by [https://www.nytimes.com/movies/person/189594/Raffaele-Donato Raffaele Donato] at Film History: An International Journal Volume 19, Number 2, 2007

The Institute’s scientific advisory council consists of 25 reputable scholars,&lt;ref&gt;[http://medienpolitik.eu/cms/index.php?idcat=14 Wissenschaftlicher Beirat, IfM.] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110720164651/http://medienpolitik.eu/cms/index.php?idcat=14 |date=2011-07-20 }}&lt;/ref&gt; all of whom gained recognition in the field through media and communication policy-related publications. 
[[Lutz Hachmeister]], a journalist and media scholar, is the founding director of the Institute. The institute has been established as a non-profit, limited liability company ([[gGmbH]]) operates independently, and has no political, party, or economic ties.

==Functions==
According to its mission statement the IfM is “a forum for the media industry, research into communication and current politics”.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://medienpolitik.eu/cms/index.php?idcat=56 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2009-12-14 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100415231919/http://medienpolitik.eu/cms/index.php?idcat=56 |archivedate=2010-04-15 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; It aims to offer “concrete models and options for the solution of mediapolitical challenges” as well as a framework for discussing these with representatives from the political sphere. Its aim is to gain recognition for the economic and public relevance as well as the strategic significance of media policies in modern politics.
The principal task of the Institute is the continuous maintenance of an online media industry database (print-, radio-, TV- and online-media) compiling, amongst other, an annual ranking of the world’s most influential and successful media companies.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.mediadb.eu/en.html&lt;/ref&gt; 
Further research tasks include:
-	Establishing the theoretical and empirical foundation for a basic understanding of mediapolitical ideas and positions, as well as its specific terminologies
-	Research into the shifting correlation of print- and online media  
-	Publication and editorial supervision of the “Jahrbuch Fernsehen” (German television yearbook).&lt;ref&gt;http://www.jahrbuch-fernsehen.de&lt;/ref&gt;

The institute established its good reputation by hosting high ranking colloquiums on media policy. Among the speakers were guests such as: [[Greg Dyke]] ([[British Film Institute]]),  [[Alan Rusbridger]] (Chief Editor of [[The Guardian]]), [[Norman Pearlstine]] (chief content officer of [[Bloomberg L.P.]]), [[Tyler Brûlé]] (founder of the [[Wallpaper*]] magazine), [[Mathias Müller von Blumencron]] and [[Georg Mascolo]] (Chief Editors of [[Der Spiegel]]), [[Ernst Uhrlau]] (President of the German Intelligence Service), [[Viviane Reding]] (EU-commissioner for information society and media), [[David Weinberger]] (fellow at the [[Berkman Center for Internet and Society]] at [[Harvard Law School]]), and technology scholars [[Evgeny Morozov]] and [[Geert Lovink]].
The IfM was elected one of the most important non-university institutes of media research within the framework of the programme “Germany thinks”,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.goethe.de/wis/fut/prj/for/med/deindex.htm&lt;/ref&gt; an initiative of the [[Goethe-Institut]].

== Cologne Futures ==
Since 2012 the Institute annually organizes the Cologne Futures, until 2015 by the name Cologne Conference Futures. The conference discusses changes within the media-system - described as Media-evolution - and deals with [[Technology assessment]] in theory and practice.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8318">[[Image:CalebWilliams.jpg|thumb|right|[[William Godwin|William Godwin's]] ''[[Caleb Williams]]'', the quintessential Jacobin novel]]

'''Jacobin novels''' were written between 1780 and 1805 by British radicals who supported the ideals of the [[French revolution]]. The term was coined by literary scholar [[Gary Kelly (scholar)|Gary Kelly]] in ''The English Jacobin Novel 1780-1805'' (1976) but drawn from the title of the ''Anti-Jacobin: or, Weekly Examiner'', a conservative periodical founded by the [[Tory]] politician [[George Canning]]. Canning chose to tar British reformers with the French term for the most radical revolutionaries: [[Jacobin Club|Jacobin]]. Among the Jacobin novelists were [[William Godwin]], [[Robert Bage]], [[Elizabeth Inchbald]], and [[Charlotte Turner Smith]].&lt;ref&gt;Bellamy, Liz Bellamy. "[http://www.litencyc.com/php/stopics.php?rec=true&amp;UID=1555 Jacobin Novel]". ''The Literary Encyclopedia''. Published on 24 May 2005. The Literary Dictionary Company. Retrieved on 30 August 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; 

The genre began in an attempt to make revolutionary thought more entertaining and easier to comprehend for the lower order. On the midst of the [[French Revolution]], literacy was growing amongst the lower classes, the mass behind the revolutionaries. “A reading public had become a revolutionary public.”&lt;ref&gt;M. O. Grenby, ''The Anti-Jacobin Novel: British Conservatism and the French Revolution'' (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 2001) p.14 &lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Jacobin (politics)|Jacobin]] novelists used this literacy to swell their radical beliefs throughout the lower classes. The Jacobin novelists adapted the romance novel structure into radical political subjects. The Jacobins cleverly blended their revolutionary principles into engaging, fantastical tales of honor, cruelty, and power. The Jacobin novelists were able to reach a massive non-intellectual demographic, which was generally apolitical, through this new genre.  

The Jacobin novel, most quintessentially represented in [[William Godwin]]’s [[Caleb Williams]] (1794), attacked the established social and political order. Along with William Godwin, some of the major Jacobin novelists include, [[Elizabeth Inchbald]], [[Thomas Holcroft]], and the earliest, [[Robert Bage]]. Of all these authors, Godwin was the most effective and outstanding. Almost all of the Jacobin novels reflect theories and principles of Godwin’s [[Enquiry Concerning Political Justice]]. Although it is not a novel it is the foundation that the goals of the Jacobin novelists’ are based upon. 

In Godwin’s novel, Caleb Williams, the [[protagonist]] is a devoutly honorable man who is cast into a “theater of calamity” by unforeseen circumstances. Throughout Caleb’s entire journey, whenever he comes in contact with any forms of government or institutions of law he is cruelly and wrongfully castigated. Godwin’s novel is an illustration of the effects of an abusive and tyrannical government, it reveals the devastating effects that established power can result in.

The Jacobin novel was especially significant because its audience was the masses. The Jacobins’ message, although superficially simple, was very complex, and in the opinion of the conservatives, too complex for the lower order to understand. The reactionaries believed that the Jacobin novels were incredibly dangerous because it put ideas of revolution in the minds of those who couldn’t fully understand the concept. The Jacobin novel led to a great anxiety by the government and the middle and upper classes. At one point there was even a suggestion to create a new tax on books in order to discourage literacy among the poor. In order to defend against these revolutionaries another genre was born, the anti-Jacobin novel.

==Anti-Jacobin novel==

Although the Jacobin novelists are contemporarily more popular, the anti-Jacobin novel overtook it across the 1790s and into the early 19th century. The anti-Jacobin novel became immensely popular around the late 1790s (bolstered by [[Reign of Terror|the Terror]]), although they began to appear in the middle of the decade. The genre itself is neither original nor impulsive, without the Jacobin novel it would not exist. 

Anti-revolutionaries saw these Jacobin novelists as corrupting the ignorant lower classes by disguising fiction as reason. These reactionaries saw this blend of political thought into the fiction novel as radical, even anarchistic, propaganda that the Jacobins were tricking the non-intellectual lower order into supporting. 

In [[Thomas James Mathias]]'s ''[[The Pursuits of Literature]]'' (1794), he states, “Government and Literature are now more than ever intimately connected.” What Matias goes on to clarify is that in order to defeat the radicals, conservative writers must change their approach in order to capture the audience. To defend [[King]] and country, conservatives decided the best way to attack the radicals was through the same medium. The conservatives’ goal became, paradoxically, to take up the fiction that they had denounced and write their own fictional satires of the Jacobin novels, for the same audience. By adopting the Jacobins’ [[propaganda]] conveyance, the anti-Jacobins were able to captivate the lower order in the same way but with the opposite message. 

Among dozens of the anti-Jacobin novels, [[George Walker (novelist)|George Walker]]'s ''[[The Vagabond (George Walker novel)|The Vagabond]]'' has been called the most effectual. ''The Vagabond'' points to flaws of revolutionary philosophy and suggests it would be disastrous if ever put into practice.  The novel includes numerous direct quotations of Godwin's doctrine and illustrates its application, with satirically dreadful results. The book is a blatant attack on Godwin, and the Jacobin novel. 

Along with Walker there were [[Elizabeth Hamilton (writer)|Elizabeth Hamilton]], [[Robert Bisset]], [[Henry James Pye]], [[Charles Lloyd (poet)|Charles Lloyd]], [[Jane West]], and [[Edward Dubois (wit)|Edward Dubois]]. These anti-Jacobin novelists combined history and fiction through [[satire]].  Walker clarifies this goal in his dedication of The Vagabond, “Romances are only Histories which we do not believe to be true, and Histories are Romances we do believe to be true.” Although the anti-Jacobins despised the Jacobins’ [[radicalism (historical)|radical]] adaptations of the romance structures of the novel, they also realized how effective it could be among the impressionable and naïve lower order. Consequently, the anti-Jacobins decided to fight fire with fire. 

In the anti-Jacobins’ opinions, the Jacobin novelists placed more importance on the romance of the novel than on truth and history. To differentiate themselves from this the anti-Jacobins strove to emphasize truth and historical precedents.  Simply put, the goal of the anti-Jacobins was to defeat radicalism by challenging the blend of [[political treatise]] and romance while maintaining the importance of truth and history. 

The formula of the anti-Jacobin novel usually includes a satirical interpretation of revolutionaries or revolutionary supporters who accept the power of romance over reason, Jacobin protagonists whose principles are egotistical and/or criminal, verbatim invocations of Godwin’s texts, and a failure of revolutionary philosophy put into place. Many of the novels illustrate the danger of politics in a novel and the susceptibility of the naïve to corruption through the novel. The irony of a novel telling the reader the danger of novels was not missed by the reader and worked to precipitate the relative failure of the genre.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="11817">The '''Kisra legend''' is a migration story shared by a number of political and ethnic groups in modern [[Nigeria]], [[Benin]], and [[Cameroon]], primarily the [[Borgu]] kingdom and the people of the [[Benue River]] valley.  The migration legend depicts the arrival of a large military force in what is currently Northern Nigeria around the 7th Century AD.  The Borgu kingdom claimed direct descent from the leader of this migration and a number of other polities recognize the migration through ceremony and formal regalia. There are a number of different versions of the legend with Kisra sometimes being depicted as a religious and military rival to [[Muhammad]] near Mecca around the time that Islam was founded and sometimes as the remnant forces of a [[Sassanian Empire|Persian]] king defeated in Egypt. The legend was a key piece of evidence in a number of [[Hamitic]] historical theories which argued that the political development of societies in sub-Saharan Africa was the result of contacts with societies from the Middle East (namely Egypt, Rome, and the Byzantine Empire).

==The Kisra legend==
[[Image:Borgu.jpeg|thumb|450px|The Borgu kingdom]]
The legend is shared by many different political and ethnic entities throughout what is currently northern Nigeria and has provided important linkages between these communities. Although the different versions share a similar depiction of a large migration into the area along the Niger river in around the 7th Century. Two of the most prominent versions of the story depict Kisra as a challenger to Muhammad on the Arabian peninsula or as a Persian ruler who suffered a military defeat in Egypt.{{sfn|Stevens Jr.|1975|p=190}} However, in some versions Kisra is not an individual person but a generalized title for the leader of the migration as it moved across Africa.{{sfn|McCall|1968|p=262}} Versions also differ on other aspects of the story, namely whether or not Kisra himself founded any of the royal lines and the specifics of his death or magical disappearance.{{sfn|Stevens Jr.|1975|p=190}}

===Kisra as challenger to Muhammad===
In the most prominent version of the story in the Borgu kingdom, Kisra is depicted as an early political and religious challenger to Muhammad in the area around Mecca.{{sfn|Adekunle|1994|p=545}} In this version, Kisra was a prominent leader and possessed a number of magical powers. However, during his rule, a seer foresaw that his power would eventually be undermined by a child born within the city who would have divine powers.{{sfn|Stewart|1980|p=61}} To prevent this challenge, Kisra exiled all the men of his city on the date that the seer had predicted the baby to be conceived; however, the husband of Aminatu, Kisra's daughter, remained in the city and a son was conceived, Muhammad.  As Muhammad grew, he began trying to convert Kisra to Islam, but the ruler resisted. Eventually, this resulted in open warfare between Muhammad and Kisra over religious issues and Kisra won the initial conflict. However, as Muhammad fled to a [[Adansonia|baobab tree]] he was provided divine assistance for his escape and to reorganize his forces.{{sfn|Adekunle|1994|p=545}} Seeing that the tables had turned, Kisra and his followers left the Arabian peninsula, eventually reaching the Niger river.{{sfn|Stewart|1980|pp=61-63}} Kisra's party visited many of the villages in the area before eventually founding the Borgu kingdom.  In some versions of the legend, Kisra's oldest son Woru (or sometimes Kisra himself) founded the city of [[Bussa, Nigeria|Bussa]], which would become the capital of Borgu. Kisra's younger sons founded [[Nikki, Benin|Nikki]], founded by Shabi, and [[Illo]], founded by Bio.{{sfn|Akinwumi|1998|p=1}} In later versions, this order of foundation of the main cities of the Borgu kingdom is changed.{{sfn|Akinwumi|1998|p=1}} The legend became crucial in the Borgu kingdom in uniting the different cities,{{sfn|Stevens Jr.|1975|p=189}} legitimizing the ruling dynasty (the Wasangari),{{sfn|Akinwumi|1998|p=1}} and providing an ideological distinction between Borgu and the Islamic states in the area.{{sfn|Adekunle|1994|p=545}}

===Kisra as Persian king===
In 1909, the German anthropologist [[Leo Frobenius]] compiled an aggregate version of the Kisra legend from informants in the Benue river valley. This version depicts Kisra not as a challenger to Mohammad, but instead as a Persian king who suffered a military defeat in Egypt to a Byzantine army.{{sfn|Stewart|1980|p=63}} Following this defeat, Kisra and his army were unable to return to Persia and had to work further into Africa. His army settled briefly in Nubia and Ethiopia where Kisra joined forces with a powerful king in the region, Napata, to conquer lands to the West. His army migrated into the Niger river region and then followed a similar route as that described above with Kisra's party visiting a number of communities in the area and eventually settling in the Borgu area.{{sfn|Stewart|1980|p=63}}

===Polities linked to Kisra's migration===
Many communities in the area have some connection to the Kisra migration and the story is used in much of the folklore of the region.  However, some cities claim direct connection to the Kisra.  These include:
*Borgu kingdom, the cities of Bussa, Nikki, and Illo claim to have been founded by Kisra and his sons.{{sfn|Stewart|1980|p=55}}
*Gunji, believed to be the location where Kisra's three sons divided from one another to found the three cities of the Borgu kingdom.{{sfn|Stewart|1980|p=55}}
*Karissen, a [[Cipu language|cipu]] city east of [[Yauri, Nigeria]] in the Benue river area, legends say that the people in the area named Kisra's grandson, Damasa, as their king.{{sfn|The Acipu People|2011}}
*[[Kebbi Emirate]], has a long tradition of the Kisra legend,{{sfn|Stevens Jr.|1975|p=194}} and the royal title in Kebbi of "Kanta" may be derived from the title Kisra.{{sfn|Adenkule|2004|p=53}}
*[[Wukari]], the king holds an ancient sword and spear said to be gifts from Kisra when he visited the area.{{sfn|Stewart|1980|p=56}}
*[[Zaria]], in some versions this city was founded by Kisra's forces before it was destroyed by the [[Bornu Empire|Bornu]] kingdom.{{sfn|Stewart|1980|p=55}}
**[[Wukari]], founded by a leader of Zaria after the destruction of Zaria.
**[[Idah]], founded by a leader of Zaria after the destruction of Zaria.{{sfn|Stewart|1980|p=56}}

===Basis of the legend===
[[Image:Khosrau I Textile.jpg|thumb|[[Egypt]]ian woven pattern woolen curtain or trousers, which was a copy of a Sassanid silk import, which was in turn based on a fresco of Persian King Khosrau II fighting [[Ethiopia]]n forces in [[Yemen]], 5-6th century.|280px]]
Anthropologists and historians have conducted significant oral histories and material research to identify any correspondence of key parts of the legend.  These studies generally agree that a migration into the area did occur around the seventh century.{{sfn|Stevens Jr.|1975|p=189}} Frobenius argued that the figure of Kisra was possibly the Persian king [[Khosrau II|Khosrau II or Chosroes]].{{sfn|McCall|1968|p=258}} Some parts of the historical account do correspond with the timeline of Khosrau II who conquered Egypt in the early 7th century before being defeated by a Byzantine army and it is considered possible that some parts of the army were unable to return to Persia and so journeyed through Africa.{{sfn|Fage|1969|p=9}} [[Flora Shaw]] in contrast argued that Kisra was a mistranslation of "Christ" and that the migration was largely of Christian origin.{{sfn|McCall|1968|p=258}} C.K. Moss instead contends that Kisra was more likely a Songhai or Mosi king who rose to prominence in the 15th century.{{sfn|McCall|1968|p=259}}

In summarizing this work, historian Daniel McCall finds that although there is no clear evidence disproving any of these arguments, there are significant problems with all of them, including: the migrating army is said to use armor not used by the Persians at that time, a lack of ecclesiastical historical corroboration, and no Christian or [[Mithraic]] symbols came with the migration.{{sfn|McCall|1968|p=275}}

==Importance==
The Kisra legend is a very important folklore in many of the communities of northern Nigeria.  The legend was a key part of developing clear cultural identity in Borgu and Kebbi as they resisted Songhai and Fulani dominance to the north.{{sfn|Adenkule|2004|p=53}} In addition, the shared Kisra legend facilitated trade and peace treaties between the various ethnic and political communities in the area.{{sfn|Adenkule|2004|p=53}}  Most notably, Borgu and [[Bornu Empire|Bornu]] and Borgu and Kebbi maintained productive trade relations for centuries often facilitated by Kisra traditions of gift exchange.{{sfn|Stevens Jr.|1975|p=194}}{{sfn|Adenkule|2004|p=53}} After British control of Nigeria around 1900, administrative change and competition in the new governmental structures led to changes in the legend for each different community.{{sfn|Akinwumi|1998|p=7}}

The legend played a key role in many (now largely discredited) Hamitic theories of African political and social development.{{sfn|Fage|1969|p=9}} These theories argued that political development, namely the formation of complex states, had its origins in migrations of people from the Middle East or of Christian influences (often Coptic).{{sfn|Stevens Jr.|1975|p=190}} The Kisra legend, and particularly the hypothesis that Kisra was actually Khosrau II, was seen as clear evidence for Egyptian, Nubian, Byzantine, or Persian influence into the development of West Africa. Without additional historical evidence though the importance of the Kisra legend was often overemphasized.{{sfn|McCall|1968|p=270}}{{sfn|Fage|1969|p=10}}

'''L'eggs''' is a brand of [[pantyhose]] introduced in 1969 by [[Hanesbrands|Hanes]]. The hosiery placed its product in white plastic oversized chicken-egg-shaped containers. In a time when hosiery products were sold primarily in department and women's clothing stores, L'eggs garnered shelf space in supermarkets and drugstores, often on revolving carousel L'eggs displays called the "L'eggs Boutique". The product's slogan, "Our L'eggs fit your legs", appeared in print and TV ads.

Though the L'eggs egg became integral to the brand and their marketing and advertising, in 1991 Hanes ceased packaging the hosiery in the hard plastic containers, as the plastic eggs were seen as an example of wastefulness.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Anthony |last=Ramirez |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1991/07/10/business/l-eggs-makes-big-switch-from-plastic-to-cardboard.html |title=L'eggs Makes Big Switch: From Plastic to Cardboard |work=[[The New York Times]] |date=July 10, 1991 |accessdate=May 31, 2015 |page=D7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Linda Gray]], [[Juliet Prowse]], [[Barbara Eden]] and [[Joyce DeWitt]] were among some of the celebrity spokespersons featured in print ads and TV commercials for L'eggs during the 1970s and 1980s.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.retroland.com/leggs/ L’eggs at "Retroland"]&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5287">The '''Lord Chamberlain's Office''' is a department within the British [[Royal Households of the United Kingdom|Royal Household]]. It is concerned with matters such as [[protocol (diplomacy)|protocol]], [[state visit]]s, [[investiture]]s, [[garden party|garden parties]], the [[State Opening of Parliament]], royal weddings and funerals. For example, in April 2005 it organised the [[wedding of Charles, Prince of Wales and Camilla Parker Bowles]]. It is also responsible for authorising use of the [[Royal coat of arms of the United Kingdom|Royal Arms]].

As the [[Lord Chamberlain]] is a part-time position the day-to-day work of the Office is conducted by the [[Comptroller]] of the Lord Chamberlain's Office.

==Theatre censorship==
The [[Lord Chamberlain]]'s Office had a more significant role in British society prior to 1968, as it was the official [[censorship|censor]] for virtually all theatre performed in Britain. Commercial theatre owners were generally satisfied by the safety this arrangement gave them; so long as they presented only licensed plays they were effectively immune from prosecution for any offence a play might cause.  There were campaigns by playwrights, however, in opposition to the Lord Chamberlain's censorship, such as those involving [[J. M. Barrie]] in 1909 and 1911. Some plays were not licensed in the 1930s, during the period of [[appeasement]], because they were critical of the German Nazi regime and it was feared that allowing certain plays to be performed might alienate what was still thought of as a friendly government.&lt;ref name="Nicholson"&gt;{{cite news|last=Nicholson|first=Steve|url=https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2015/jul/21/royal-household-suppressed-anti-nazi-theatre-1930s|title=Theatre of war: how the monarchy suppressed anti-Nazi drama in the 1930s|work=The Guardian|date=21 July 2015|accessdate=23 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Rowland Baring, 2nd Earl of Cromer|Lord Cromer]], then Lord Chamberlain, regularly consulted the Foreign Office and sometimes, the German Embassy. In the latter case, the submissions were intended to be read by a "friendly German".&lt;ref name="Nicholson"/&gt;

By the 1960s, there were many playwrights and [[theatrical producer|producer]]s who wished to produce controversial works such as ''[[Lady Chatterley's Lover]]''. Theatre companies such as the [[Royal Court Theatre]] came into open conflict with the Lord Chamberlain's Office. Sometimes they would resort to such measures as declaring themselves private clubs for the performance of certain plays. The Lord Chamberlain's Office technically had jurisdiction over private performances, but had generally avoided getting involved with bona-fide private clubs. The various activist groups did not actually come up with solid legal loopholes, but the publicity they generated eventually resulted in the abolition of the role of official censor in the [[Theatres Act 1968]].

{{About|devices designed to perform tasks|other uses|Machine (disambiguation)}}

A '''machine''' (or '''mechanical device''') is a [[mechanical structure]] that uses [[Power (physics)|power]] to apply forces and control movement to perform an intended action.  Machines can be driven by animals and people, by natural forces such as wind and water, and by chemical, [[thermal]], or electrical power, and include a system of [[mechanism (engineering)|mechanisms]] that shape the actuator input to achieve a specific application of output forces and movement.  They can also include computers and sensors that monitor performance and plan movement, often called [[mechanical system]]s.

Renaissance natural philosophers identified six [[simple machine]]s which were the elementary devices that put a load into motion, and calculated the ratio of output force to input force, known today as [[mechanical advantage]].&lt;ref name="Usher"&gt;{{cite book

Modern machines are complex systems that consist of structural elements, mechanisms and control components and include interfaces for convenient use.  Examples include a wide range of [[vehicle]]s, such as [[Car|automobiles]], [[boat]]s and [[airplane]]s, [[Home appliance|appliances]] in the home and office, building [[air handler|air handling]] and [[Plumbing|water handling systems]], as well as [[Agricultural machinery|farm machinery]], [[machine tool]]s and [[Automation|factory automation]] systems and [[robot]]s.

==Etymology==
The English word ''machine'' comes through [[Middle French]] from [[Latin]] ''machina'',&lt;ref name=AHD&gt;''The American Heritage Dictionary'', Second College Edition. Houghton Mifflin Co., 1985.&lt;/ref&gt; which in turn derives from the [[ancient Greek|Greek]] ([[Doric Greek|Doric]] {{lang|grc|μαχανά }} {{lang|grc-Latn|makhana}}, [[Ionic Greek|Ionic]] {{lang|grc|μηχανή }} {{lang|grc-Latn|mekhane}} "contrivance, machine, engine",&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0057%3Aentry%3Dmhxanh%2F "μηχανή"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110629140054/http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus:text:1999.04.0057:entry=mhxanh%2F |date=2011-06-29 }}, Henry George Liddell, Robert Scott, ''A Greek-English Lexicon'', on Perseus project&lt;/ref&gt; a derivation from {{lang|grc|μῆχος }} {{lang|grc-Latn|mekhos}} "means, expedient, remedy"&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0057%3Aentry%3Dmh%3Dxos "μῆχος"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110629140106/http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus:text:1999.04.0057:entry=mh=xos |date=2011-06-29 }}, Henry George Liddell, Robert Scott, ''A Greek-English Lexicon'', on Perseus project&lt;/ref&gt;).&lt;ref&gt;Oxford Dictionaries, [https://en.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/machine machine]&lt;/ref&gt; The word ''mechanical'' (Greek: μηχανικός) comes from the same Greek roots. A wider meaning of "fabric, structure" is found in classical Latin, but not in Greek usage.  This meaning is found in late medieval French, and is adopted from the French into English in the mid-16th century.

In the 17th century, the word could also mean a scheme or plot, a meaning now expressed by the derived [[:wikt:machination|machination]]. The modern meaning develops out of specialized application of the term to [[stagecraft|stage engines]] used in [[Elizabethan theater|theater]] and to military [[siege engine]]s, both in the late 16th and early 17th centuries. The [[OED]] traces the formal, modern meaning to [[John Harris (writer)|John Harris]]' ''[[Lexicon Technicum]]'' (1704), which has:

:''Machine, or Engine, in Mechanicks, is whatsoever hath Force sufficient either to raise or stop the Motion of a Body... Simple Machines are commonly reckoned to be Six in Number, viz. the Ballance, Leaver, Pulley, Wheel, Wedge, and Screw... Compound Machines, or Engines, are innumerable.''
The word ''[[:wikt:engine|engine]]'' used as a (near-)synonym both by Harris and in later language derives ultimately (via Old French) from Latin ''ingenium'' "ingenuity, an invention".

==History==
[[File:Flint hand axe.JPG|thumb|right|Flint hand axe found in [[Winchester]]]]
The [[hand axe]], made by chipping flint to form a [[wedge (mechanical device)|wedge]], in the hands of a human transforms force and movement of the tool into a transverse splitting forces and movement of the workpiece.

The idea of a ''simple machine'' originated with the Greek philosopher [[Archimedes]] around the 3rd century BC, who studied the Archimedean simple machines: lever, pulley, and screw.&lt;ref name="Asimov1988"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Chiu"&gt;{{Citation

During the [[Renaissance]] the dynamics of the ''Mechanical Powers'', as the simple machines were called, began to be studied from the standpoint of how much useful work they could perform, leading eventually to the new concept of mechanical [[work (physics)|work]].  In 1586 Flemish engineer [[Simon Stevin]] derived the mechanical advantage of the inclined plane, and it was included with the other simple machines.   The complete dynamic theory of simple machines was worked out by Italian scientist [[Galileo Galilei]] in 1600 in ''Le Meccaniche'' ("On Mechanics").&lt;ref name="Krebs"&gt;{{cite book

The classic rules of sliding [[friction]] in machines were discovered by [[Leonardo da Vinci]] (1452–1519), but remained unpublished in his notebooks.  They were rediscovered by [[Guillaume Amontons]] (1699) and were further developed by [[Charles-Augustin de Coulomb]] (1785).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

[[James Watt]] patented his [[parallel motion]] linkage in 1782, which made the double acting steam engine practical.&lt;ref&gt;Pennock, G. R., James Watt (1736-1819), ''Distinguished Figures in Mechanism and Machine Science,'' ed. M. Ceccarelli, Springer, 2007, {{ISBN|978-1-4020-6365-7}} (Print) 978-1-4020-6366-4 (Online).&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Boulton and Watt]] steam engine and later designs powered [[steam locomotive]]s, [[marine steam engine|steam ships]], and [[steam power|factories]].

The [[Industrial Revolution]] was a period from 1750 to 1850 where changes in agriculture, manufacturing, mining, transportation, and technology had a profound effect on the social, economic and cultural conditions of the times. It began in the [[United Kingdom]], then subsequently spread throughout [[Western Europe]], [[North America]], [[Japan]], and eventually the rest of the world.

Starting in the later part of the 18th century, there began a transition in parts of Great Britain's previously manual labour and draft-animal–based economy towards machine-based manufacturing. It started with the mechanisation of the textile industries, the development of [[iron-making]] techniques and the increased use of [[coke (fuel)|refined coal]].&lt;ref name="World History: Patterns of Interaction"/&gt;

== Simple machines ==
{{main|Simple machine}}
[[File:Table of Mechanicks, Cyclopaedia, Volume 2.png|thumb|250px|Table of simple mechanisms, from ''[[Chambers' Cyclopædia]]'', 1728.&lt;ref name="Mechanicks"&gt;{{Citation |last=Chambers |first=Ephraim |year=1728 |title=Table of Mechanicks |work=Cyclopaedia, A Useful Dictionary of Arts and Sciences |volume=Volume 2 |location=London, England |page=528, Plate 11 }}.&lt;/ref&gt; Simple machines provide a "vocabulary" for understanding more complex machines.]]

The idea that a machine can be decomposed into simple movable elements led [[Archimedes]] to define the [[lever]], [[pulley]] and [[screw]] as [[simple machines]].  By the time of the Renaissance this list increased to include the [[wheel and axle]], [[Wedge (mechanical device)|wedge]] and [[inclined plane]].  The modern approach to characterizing machines focusses on the components that allow movement, known as [[joint (mechanics)|joints]].

'''Wedge (hand axe):'''  Perhaps the first example of a device designed to manage power is the [[hand axe]], also see [[biface]] and [[Olorgesailie]].  A hand axe is made by chipping stone, generally flint, to form a bifacial edge, or [[wedge (mechanical device)|wedge]].  A wedge is a simple machine that transforms lateral force and movement of the tool into a transverse splitting force and movement of the workpiece.  The available power is limited by the effort of the person using the tool, but because power is the product of force and movement, the wedge amplifies the force by reducing the movement.  This amplification, or [[mechanical advantage]] is the ratio of the input speed to output speed.  For a wedge this is given by 1/tanα, where α is the tip angle.  The faces of a wedge are modeled as straight lines to form a sliding or [[prismatic joint]].

'''Lever:''' The [[lever]] is another important and simple device for managing power.  This is a body that pivots on a fulcrum.  Because the velocity of a point farther from the pivot is greater than the velocity of a point near the pivot, forces applied far from the pivot are amplified near the pivot by the associated decrease in speed.  If ''a'' is the distance from the pivot to the point where the input force is applied and ''b'' is the distance to the point where the output force is applied, then ''a/b'' is the [[mechanical advantage]] of the lever.  The fulcrum of a lever is modeled as a hinged or [[revolute joint]].

'''Wheel:''' The [[wheel]] is clearly an important early machine, such as the [[chariot]].  A wheel uses the law of the lever to reduce the force needed to overcome [[friction]] when pulling a load.  To see this notice that the friction associated with pulling a load on the ground is approximately the same as the friction in a simple bearing that supports the load on the axle of a wheel.  However, the wheel forms a lever that magnifies the pulling force so that it overcomes the frictional resistance in the bearing.

[[File:Kinematics of Machinery - Figure 21.jpg|thumb|right|200px|alt=Illustration of a Four-bar linkage from Kinematics of Machinery, 1876|Illustration of a four-bar linkage from [[s:The Kinematics of Machinery|''The Kinematics of Machinery'', 1876]]]]
The classification of [[simple machine]]s to provide a strategy for the design of new machines was developed by [[Franz Reuleaux]], who collected and studied over 800 elementary machines.&lt;ref&gt;[http://kmoddl.library.cornell.edu/facets/moon61899.htm Moon, F. C., The Reuleaux Collection of Kinematic Mechanisms at Cornell University, 1999] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150518064706/http://kmoddl.library.cornell.edu/facets/moon61899.htm |date=2015-05-18 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  He recognized that the classical [[simple machine]]s can be separated into the lever, pulley and wheel and axle that are formed by a body rotating about a hinge, and the inclined plane, wedge and screw that are similarly a block sliding on a flat surface.&lt;ref&gt;Hartenberg, R.S. &amp; J. Denavit (1964) [http://kmoddl.library.cornell.edu/bib.php?m=23 Kinematic synthesis of linkages] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110519063139/http://kmoddl.library.cornell.edu/bib.php?m=23 |date=2011-05-19 }}, New York: McGraw-Hill, online link from [[Cornell University]].&lt;/ref&gt;

Simple machines are elementary examples of [[kinematic chain]]s or [[linkage (mechanical)|linkages]] that are used to model [[mechanical systems]] ranging from the steam engine to robot manipulators.  The bearings that form the fulcrum of a lever and that allow the wheel and axle and pulleys to rotate are examples of a [[kinematic pair]] called a hinged joint.  Similarly, the flat surface of an inclined plane and wedge are examples of the [[kinematic pair]] called a sliding joint.  The screw is usually identified as its own kinematic pair called a helical joint.

This realization shows that it is the joints, or the connections that provide movement, that are the primary elements of a machine.  Starting with four types of joints, the rotary joint, sliding joint, cam joint and gear joint, and related connections such as cables and belts, it is possible to understand a machine as an assembly of solid parts that connect these joints called a [[mechanism (engineering)|mechanism]] .&lt;ref name="Uicker2003"/&gt;

Two levers, or cranks, are combined into a planar [[four-bar linkage]] by attaching a link that connects the output of one crank to the input of another.  Additional links can be attached to form a [[six-bar linkage]] or in series to form a robot.&lt;ref name="Uicker2003"/&gt;

[[File:SteamEngine Boulton&amp;Watt 1784.png|thumb|right|300px|alt=Boulton &amp; Watt Steam Engine|The Boulton &amp; Watt Steam Engine, 1784]]
A '''mechanical system''' manages [[power (physics)|power]] to accomplish a task that involves forces and movement. Modern machines are systems consisting of (i) a power source and [[actuator]]s that generate forces and movement, (ii) a [[Machine (mechanical)|system of mechanisms]] that shape the actuator input to achieve a specific application of output forces and movement, (iii) a controller with sensors that compare the output to a performance goal and then directs the actuator input, and (iv) an interface to an operator consisting of levers, switches, and displays. 

This can be seen in Watt's steam engine (see the illustration) in which the power is provided by steam expanding to drive the piston.  The walking beam, coupler and crank transform the linear movement of the piston into rotation of the output pulley.  Finally, the pulley rotation drives the flyball governor which controls the valve for the steam input to the piston cylinder.

The adjective "mechanical" refers to skill in the practical application of an art or science, as well as relating to or caused by movement, physical forces, properties or agents such as is dealt with by [[mechanics]].&lt;ref name=OED&gt;Oxford English Dictionary&lt;/ref&gt;  Similarly Merriam-Webster Dictionary&lt;ref name=Merriam-mechanical&gt;Merriam-Webster Dictionary [http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/mechanical Definition of mechanical] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111020103442/http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/mechanical |date=2011-10-20 }}&lt;/ref&gt; defines "mechanical" as relating to machinery or tools.

Power flow through a machine provides a way to understand the performance of devices ranging from levers and gear trains to automobiles and robotic systems.  The German [[mechanician]] [[Franz Reuleaux]]&lt;ref name=Reuleaux1876&gt;Reuleaux, F., 1876 [https://books.google.com/books?id=WUZVAAAAMAAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=kinematics+of+machinery&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=qpn4Tse-E9SasgLcsZytDw&amp;ved=0CEQQ6AEwAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=kinematics%20of%20machinery&amp;f=false ''The Kinematics of Machinery''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130602121819/http://books.google.com/books?id=WUZVAAAAMAAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=kinematics+of+machinery&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=qpn4Tse-E9SasgLcsZytDw&amp;ved=0CEQQ6AEwAQ |date=2013-06-02 }} (trans. and annotated by A. B. W. Kennedy), reprinted by Dover, New York (1963)&lt;/ref&gt; wrote, "a machine is a combination of resistant bodies so arranged that by their means the mechanical forces of nature can be compelled to do work accompanied by certain determinate motion." Notice that forces and motion combine to define [[Power (physics)|power]].

More recently, Uicker et al.&lt;ref name=Uicker2003&gt;J. J. Uicker, G. R. Pennock, and J. E. Shigley, 2003, ''Theory of Machines and Mechanisms,'' Oxford University Press, New York.&lt;/ref&gt; stated that a machine is "a device for applying power or changing its direction."  McCarthy and Soh&lt;ref name=McCarthy2010&gt;J. M. McCarthy and G. S. Soh, 2010, [https://books.google.com/books?id=jv9mQyjRIw4C&amp;pg=PA231 ''Geometric Design of Linkages,''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160819020038/https://books.google.com/books?id=jv9mQyjRIw4C&amp;pg=PA231 |date=2016-08-19 }} Springer, New York.&lt;/ref&gt; describe a machine as a system that "generally consists of a power source and a [[mechanism (engineering)|mechanism]] for the controlled use of this power."

== Power sources ==
[[File:Model Engine Luc Viatour.jpg|thumb|right|350px|Diesel engine, friction clutch and gear transmission of an automobile.]]
[[File:Generator-20071117.jpg|thumb|right|Early [[Ganz]] Electric Generator in [[Zwevegem]], [[West Flanders]], [[Belgium]]]]
Human and animal effort were the original power sources for early machines.

'''Waterwheel:''' [[Waterwheel]]s appeared around the world around 300 BC to use flowing water to generate rotary motion, which was applied to [[watermill|milling grain, and powering lumber, machining and textile operations]].  Modern [[water turbine]]s use water flowing through a [[dam]] to drive an [[electric generator]].

'''Windmill:''' Early [[wind mill|windmills]] captured wind power to generate rotary motion for milling operations.  Modern [[wind turbine]]s also drives a generator. This electricity in turn is used to drive [[Electric motor|motors]] forming the actuators of mechanical systems.

'''Engine:''' The word engine derives from "ingenuity" and originally referred to contrivances that may or may not be physical devices.  See [http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/engine Merriam-Webster's definition of engine]. A [[steam engine]] uses heat to boil water contained in a pressure vessel; the expanding steam drives a piston or a turbine. This principle can be seen in the [[aeolipile]] of Hero of Alexandria. This is called an [[external combustion engine]].

An [[automobile]] engine is called an [[internal combustion engine]] because it burns fuel (an [[exothermic]] chemical reaction) inside a cylinder and uses the expanding gases to drive a [[piston]].  A [[jet engine]] uses a turbine to compress air which is burned with fuel so that it expands through a nozzle to provide thrust to an [[aircraft]], and so is also an "internal combustion engine."  &lt;ref&gt;"Internal combustion engine", ''Concise Encyclopedia of Science and Technology'', Third Edition, Sybil P. Parker, ed. McGraw-Hill, Inc., 1994, p. 998 .&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Power plant:'''  The heat from coal and natural gas combustion in a [[boiler]] generates steam that drives a [[steam turbine]] to rotate an [[electric generator]].  A [[nuclear power plant]] uses heat from a [[nuclear reactor]] to generate steam and [[electric power]].  This power is distributed through a [[electrical grid|network of transmission lines]] for industrial and individual use.

'''Motors:''' [[Electric motor]]s use either [[alternating current|AC]] or [[direct current|DC]] electric current to generate rotational movement.  Electric [[servomechanism|servomotors]] are the actuators for mechanical systems ranging from [[robotics|robotic systems]] to [[fly-by-wire|modern aircraft]].

'''Fluid Power:'''  [[hydraulic cylinder|Hydraulic]] and [[pneumatic cylinder|pneumatic]] systems use electrically driven [[pump]]s to drive water or air respectively into cylinders to power [[linear actuator|linear movement]].

== Mechanisms ==
The ''mechanism'' of a mechanical system is assembled from components called ''[[machine element]]s''.  These elements provide structure for the system and control its movement.

The structural components are, generally, the frame members, bearings, splines, springs,  seals, [[fastener]]s and covers.  The shape, texture and color of covers provide a [[industrial design|styling and operational interface]] between the mechanical system and its users.

The assemblies that control movement are also called "[[mechanism (engineering)|mechanisms]]." &lt;ref&gt;Reuleaux, F., 1876 '''The Kinematics of Machinery,''' (trans. and annotated by A. B. W. Kennedy), reprinted by Dover, New York (1963)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;J. J. Uicker, G. R. Pennock, and J. E. Shigley, 2003, '''Theory of Machines and Mechanisms,''' Oxford University Press, New York.&lt;/ref&gt;  Mechanisms are generally classified as [[gear]]s and [[gear train]]s, which includes [[belt drive]]s and [[chain drive]]s, [[cam]] and [[cam follower|follower]] mechanisms,  and [[linkage (mechanical)|linkages]], though there are other special mechanisms such as clamping linkages, [[Geneva drive|indexing mechanisms]], [[escapement]]s and friction devices such as [[brake]]s and [[clutch]]es.

The number of degrees of freedom of a mechanism, or its mobility, depends on the number of links and joints and the types of joints used to construct the mechanism. The general mobility of a mechanism is the difference between the unconstrained freedom of the links and the number of constraints imposed by the joints.  It is described by the [[Chebychev-Grübler-Kutzbach criterion]].

=== Gears and gear trains ===
[[File:NAMA Machine d'Anticythère 1.jpg|thumb|left|250px|The [[Antikythera mechanism]] (main fragment)]]
The transmission of rotation between contacting toothed wheels can be traced back to the [[Antikythera mechanism]] of Greece and the [[south-pointing chariot]] of China.  Illustrations by the renaissance scientist [[Georgius Agricola]] show gear trains with cylindrical teeth.  The implementation of the [[involute gear|involute tooth]] yielded a standard gear design that provides a constant speed ratio.  Some important features of gears and gear trains are:
* The ratio of the pitch circles of mating gears defines the [[gear ratio|speed ratio]] and the [[mechanical advantage]] of the gear set.
*  A [[epicyclic gearing|planetary gear train]] provides high gear reduction in a compact package.
*  It is possible to design gear teeth for gears that are [[non-circular gear|non-circular]], yet still transmit torque smoothly.
*  The speed ratios of [[chain drive|chain]] and [[belt (mechanical)|belt drives]] are computed in the same way as gear ratios.  See [[bicycle gearing]].

=== Cam and follower mechanisms ===
A [[cam]] and [[cam follower|follower]] is formed by the direct contact of two specially shaped links.  The driving link is called the cam (also see [[camshaft|cam shaft]]) and the link that is driven through the direct contact of their surfaces is called the follower.  The shape of the contacting surfaces of the [[cam]] and [[cam follower|follower]] determines the movement of the mechanism.

=== Linkages ===
[[File:Landing gear schematic.svg|thumb|right|300px|Schematic of the actuator and four-bar linkage that position an aircraft landing gear.]]
A [[linkage (mechanical)|linkage]] is a collection of links connected by joints.  Generally, the links are the structural elements and the joints allow movement.  Perhaps the single most useful example is the planar [[four-bar linkage]].  However, there are many more special linkages:
* [[Watt's linkage]] is a four-bar linkage that generates an approximate straight line.  It was critical to the operation of his design for the steam engine.  This linkage also appears in vehicle suspensions to prevent side-to-side movement of the body relative to the wheels.  Also see the article [[Parallel motion]].
* The success of Watt's linkage lead to the design of similar approximate straight-line linkages, such as [[Hoekens linkage|Hoeken's linkage]] and [[Chebyshev linkage|Chebyshev's linkage]].
* The [[Peaucellier-Lipkin linkage|Peaucellier linkage]] generates a true straight-line output from a rotary input.
* The [[Sarrus linkage]] is a spatial linkage that generates straight-line movement from a rotary input.  Select this link for an animation of the [http://mechanicaldesign101.com/2009/04/27/c-j-sangwins-linkage-movies/ Sarrus linkage]
* The [[Klann linkage]] and the [[Theo Jansen|Jansen linkage]] are recent inventions that provide interesting walking movements.  They are respectively a six-bar and an eight-bar linkage.

===Planar mechanism===
A planar mechanism is a mechanical system that is constrained so the trajectories of points in all the bodies of the system lie on planes parallel to a ground plane.  The rotational axes of hinged joints that connect the bodies in the system are perpendicular to this ground plane.

===Spherical mechanism===
A '''spherical mechanism'''  is a mechanical system in which the bodies move in a way that the trajectories of points in the system lie on concentric spheres.  The rotational axes of hinged joints that connect the bodies in the system pass through the center of these circle.

===Spatial mechanism===
A '''spatial mechanism'''  is a mechanical system that has at least one body that moves in a way that its point trajectories are general space curves. The rotational axes of hinged joints that connect the bodies in the system form lines in space that do not intersect and have distinct common normals.

=== Flexure mechanisms ===
A flexure mechanism consists of a series of rigid bodies connected by compliant elements (also known as flexure joints) that is designed to produce a geometrically well-defined motion upon application of a force.

==Machine elements==
The elementary mechanical components of a machine are termed '''[[machine element]]s'''.  These elements consist of three basic types (i) ''structural components'' such as frame members, bearings, axles, splines, [[fastener]]s, seals, and lubricants, (ii) ''[[Mechanism (engineering)|mechanisms]]'' that control movement in various ways such as [[gear train]]s, [[belt (mechanical)|belt]] or [[chain drive]]s, [[Linkage (mechanical)|linkages]], [[cam]] and [[cam follower|follower]] systems, including [[brake]]s and [[clutch]]es, and (iii) ''control components'' such as buttons, switches, indicators, sensors, actuators and computer controllers.&lt;ref&gt;Robert L. Norton, ''Machine Design,'' (4th Edition), Prentice-Hall, 2010&lt;/ref&gt;  While generally not considered to be a machine element, the shape, texture and color of covers are an important part of a machine that provide a [[industrial design|styling and operational interface]] between the mechanical components of a machine and its users.

===Structural components===
A number of machine elements provide important structural functions such as the frame, bearings, splines, spring and seals.
* The recognition that the frame of a mechanism is an important machine element changed the name [[three-bar linkage]] into [[four-bar linkage]].  Frames are generally assembled from [[truss]] or [[beam (structure)|beam]] elements.
* [[bearing (mechanical)|Bearings]] are components designed to manage the interface between moving elements and are the source of [[friction]] in machines. In general, bearings are designed for pure rotation or [[linear-motion bearing|straight line movement]].
* [[Spline (mechanical)|Splines]] and [[key (engineering)|keys]] are two ways to reliably mount an [[axle]] to a wheel, pulley or gear so that torque can be transferred through the connection.
* [[spring (device)|Springs]] provides forces that can either hold components of a machine in place or acts as a [[suspension (vehicle)|suspension]] to support part of a machine.
* [[seal (mechanical)|Seals]] are used between mating parts of a machine to ensure fluids, such as water, hot gases, or lubricant do not leak between the mating surfaces.
* [[Fastener]]s such as [[screw]]s, bolts, spring clips, and [[rivet]]s are critical to the assembly of components of a machine. Fasteners are generally considered to be removable. In contrast, joining methods, such as [[welding]], [[soldering]], [[crimp (joining)|crimping]] and the application of [[adhesive]]s, usually require cutting the parts to disassemble the components

== Controllers ==
Controllers combine [[sensor]]s, [[logic]], and [[actuator]]s to maintain the performance of components of a machine.  Perhaps the best known is the [[centrifugal governor|flyball governor]] for a steam engine.  Examples of these devices range from a [[thermostat]] that as temperature rises opens a valve to cooling water to speed controllers such as the [[cruise control]] system in an automobile.  The [[programmable logic controller]] replaced relays and specialized control mechanisms with a programmable computer.  [[Servomotor]]s that accurately position a shaft in response to an electrical command are the actuators that make [[robot|robotic systems]] possible.

== Computing machines ==
[[File:Arithmometre%2C designed by Charles Xavier Thomas%2C c. 1820%2C for the four rules of arithmetic%2C manufactured 1866-1870 AD%2C TM10901 - Tekniska museet - Stockholm%2C Sweden - DSC01567.JPG|right|300px|thumb|alt=Arithmometr computing machine|Arithmometre, designed by Charles Xavier Thomas, c. 1820, for the four rules of arithmetic, manufactured 1866-1870 AD.

[[Charles Babbage]] designed machines to tabulate logarithms and other functions in 1837.  His [[Difference engine]] can be considered an advanced [[mechanical calculator]] and his [[Analytical Engine]] a forerunner of the modern [[computer]], though none were built in Babbage's lifetime.

The [[Arithmometer]] and the [[Comptometer]] are mechanical computers that are precursors to [[Computer|modern digital computers]].  Models used to study modern computers are termed [[Finite-state machine|State machine]] and [[Turing machine]].

== Molecular machines ==
[[Image:Protein translation.gif|left|thumb|300px| A [[ribosome]] is a [[biological machine]] that utilizes [[protein dynamics]]]]
The biological molecule [[myosin]] reacts to ATP and ADP to alternately engage with an actin filament and change its shape in a way that exerts a force, and then disengage to reset its shape, or conformation.  This acts as the molecular drive that causes muscle contraction.  Similarly the biological molecule [[kinesin]] has two sections that alternately engage and disengage with microtubules causing the molecule to move along the microtubule and transport vesicles within the cell.  These molecules are increasingly considered to be [[nanomachines]].

Researchers have used DNA to construct nano-dimensioned [[four-bar linkage]]s.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pnas.org/content/112/3/713.abstract Marras, A., Zhou, L., Su, H., and Castro, C.E.

===Mechanization and automation===
{{main article|Mechanization|automation}}
[[File:Agricola1.jpg|thumb|right|A water-powered [[Hoist (device)#Mine hoists|mine hoist]] used for raising ore. This woodblock is from ''[[De re metallica]]'' by Georg Bauer (Latinized name [[Georgius Agricola]], ca. 1555), an early mining textbook that contains numerous drawings and descriptions of mining equipment.]]
'''Mechanization'''  or mechanisation ([[British English|BE]]) is providing human operators with machinery that assists them with the muscular requirements of work or displaces muscular work.  In some fields, mechanization includes the use of hand tools.  In modern usage, such as in engineering or economics, mechanization implies machinery more complex than hand tools and would not include simple devices such as an un-geared horse or donkey mill. Devices that cause speed changes or changes to or from reciprocating to rotary motion, using means such as [[gear]]s, [[pulley]]s or [[line shaft|sheaves]] and belts, [[drive shaft|shafts]], [[cam]]s and [[Crank (mechanism)|cranks]], usually are considered machines.  After electrification, when most small machinery was no longer hand powered, mechanization was synonymous with motorized machines.&lt;ref&gt;Jerome (1934) gives the industry classification of machine tools as being "other than hand power".  Beginning with the 1900 U.S. census, power use was part of the definition of a factory, distinguishing it from a workshop.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Automation''' is the use of [[control system]]s and [[information technology|information technologies]] to reduce the need for human work in the production of goods and services. In the scope of [[industrialization]], automation is a step beyond [[mechanization]]. Whereas mechanization provides human operators with machinery to assist them with the muscular requirements of work, automation greatly decreases the need for human sensory and mental requirements as well. Automation plays an increasingly important role in the [[world economy]] and in daily experience.

===Automata===
{{main article|automaton}}
An '''automaton''' (plural: '''automata''' or '''automatons''') is a self-operating machine. The word is sometimes used to describe a [[robot]], more specifically an [[autonomous robot]].  A ''Toy Automaton'' was patented in 1863.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web| url=http://www.google.com/patents?id=QhIAAAAAEBAJ&amp;dq=patent:40891%7C | title=U.S. Patent and Trademark Office, Patent# 40891, ''Toy Automaton'' | publisher=[[Google Patents]] | accessdate=2007-01-07 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Usher, 1929, [https://books.google.com/books?id=xuDDqqa8FlwC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=history+of+mechanical+inventions&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=n5r4Tov7HaqPsQLugvWuAQ&amp;ved=0CD8Q6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=history%20of%20mechanical%20inventions&amp;f=false ''A History of Mechanical Inventions''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130602124007/http://books.google.com/books?id=xuDDqqa8FlwC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=history+of+mechanical+inventions&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=n5r4Tov7HaqPsQLugvWuAQ&amp;ved=0CD8Q6AEwAA |date=2013-06-02 }}, Harvard University Press (reprinted by Dover Publications 1968).&lt;/ref&gt; reports that [[Hero of Alexandria|Hero of Alexandria's]] treatise on ''Mechanics'' focussed on the study of lifting heavy weights.  Today [[mechanics]] refers to the mathematical analysis of the forces and movement of a mechanical system, and consists of the study of the [[kinematics]] and [[analytical dynamics|dynamics]] of these systems.

===Dynamics of machines===
The [[rigid-body dynamics|dynamic analysis]] of machines begins with a rigid-body model to determine reactions at the bearings, at which point the elasticity effects are included.  The [[rigid-body dynamics]] studies the movement of systems of interconnected bodies under the action of external forces.  The assumption that the bodies are rigid, which means that they do not deform under the action of applied forces, simplifies the analysis by reducing the parameters that describe the configuration of the system to the translation and rotation of reference frames attached to each body.&lt;ref&gt;B. Paul, Kinematics and Dynamics of Planar Machinery, Prentice-Hall, NJ, 1979&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;L. W. Tsai, Robot Analysis: The mechanics of serial and parallel manipulators, John-Wiley, NY, 1999.&lt;/ref&gt;

The dynamics of a rigid body system is defined by its [[equations of motion]], which are derived using either [[Newtons laws of motion]] or [[Lagrangian mechanics]].  The solution of these equations of motion defines how the configuration of the system of rigid bodies changes as a function of time.  The formulation and solution of rigid body dynamics is an important tool in the computer simulation of [[mechanical systems]].

=== Kinematics of machines ===
The dynamic analysis of a machine requires the determination of the movement, or [[kinematics]], of its component parts, known as kinematic analysis.  The assumption that the system is an assembly of rigid components allows rotational and translational movement to be modeled mathematically as [[rigid transformation|Euclidean, or rigid, transformations]].  This allows the position, velocity and acceleration of all points in a component to be determined from these properties for a reference point, and the angular position, angular velocity and angular acceleration of the component.

== Machine design ==
'''Machine design''' refers to the procedures and techniques used to address the three phases of a [[product lifecycle management|machine's lifecycle]]:
# '''invention''', which involves the identification of a need, development of requirements, concept generation, prototype development, manufacturing, and verification testing;
# '''performance engineering''' involves enhancing manufacturing efficiency, reducing service and maintenance demands, adding features and improving effectiveness, and validation testing;
# '''recycle''' is the decommissioning and disposal phase and includes recovery and reuse of materials and components.

'''Maghe Sankranti''' ([[Nepali language|Nepali]]:माघे सङ्क्रान्ति, [[Maithili language|Mathili]]:माघि, [[Nepal Bhasa]]:घ्यःचाकु संल्हु) is a [[Nepalis|Nepalese]] festival observed on the first of [[Magh (Nepali calendar)|Magh]] in the [[Vikram Samvat|Vikram Sambat (B.S)]] calendar (about 14 January) bringing an end to the [[winter solstice]] containing month of [[Poush]]. Maghe Sankranti is similar to [[solstice]] festivals in other religious traditions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=N. P.

Observant [[Hindu]]s take ritual baths during this festival, notably at auspicious river locations.  These include Sankhamul on the [[Bagmati River|Bagmati]] near [[Patan, Lalitpur|Patan]]; In the [[Gandaki River|Gandaki/Narayani]] river basin at Triveni, [[Devghat]] near [[Chitwan Valley]] and Ridi &lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20120502045108/http://vegetarian-restaurants.net/Nepal/Nepal-Others/Ridi-Bazaar.htm Ridi Bazaar]. vegetarian-restaurants.net&lt;/ref&gt; on the Kaligandaki; and in the [[Koshi River]] basin at Dolalghat on the Sun Koshi. Festive foods like [[laddoo]], [[ghee]] and [[sweet potato]]es are distributed. The mother of each household wishes good health to all family members.

== Date and significance ==
Generally makar sankranti falls on  14 January, and is called [[Makar Sankranti]] or other names in the [[Indian subcontinent]]. Maghe Sankranti is a major [[harvest festival]] celebrated in [[Madhesh]] and [[Tharuhat]] of [[Nepal]]. The movement of the sun from one zodiac sign into another is called Sankranti and as the Sun moves into the Capricorn zodiacal sign known as Makara, this occasion is named as Makara Sankranti in the [[Pahari people|Pahari]] context. It is one of the few [[Nepalese people|Nepalese]] festivals of [[Madhesi people|Madhesi]] and [[Tharu people]] that are celebrated on a fixed date, i.e.,  14 January because this solar festival in the honor of deity Surya follows the solar cycle of the Bikrami calendar, unlike other festivals that follow lunar cycle.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=J. Gordon Melton|title=Religious Celebrations: An Encyclopedia of Holidays, Festivals, Solemn Observances, and Spiritual Commemorations |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=KDU30Ae4S4cC&amp;pg=PA547 |year=2011|publisher=ABC-CLIO|isbn=978-1-59884-205-0|pages=547–548}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Chaturvedi, B.K.

Maghe Sankranti is regarded as marking the beginning of an auspicious phase in Nepalese culture. It is cited as the 'holy phase of transition'. It marks the end of an inauspicious phase which according to the Hindu calendar begins around mid-December. It is believed that any auspicious and sacred ritual can be sanctified in any Nepali family, this day on-wards. Scientifically, this day marks the beginning of warmer and longer days compared to the nights. In other words, Sankranti marks the termination of winter season and beginning of a new harvest or spring season.

All over the country, Maghe Sankranti is observed with great fanfares. However, it is celebrated with distinct names and rituals in different parts of the country. In the states of northern and western Nepal, the festival is celebrated as the Makar Sankranti day with special zeal and fervour. The importance of this day has been signified in the ancient epics like Mahabharata. So, apart from socio-geographical importance, Maghe Sankranti holds historical and religious significance. As it is the festival of Sun God, and he is regarded as the symbol of divinity and wisdom, the festival holds an eternal meaning.

==Makar Sankranti and the Winter Solstice==
[[File:Earth-lighting-winter-solstice EN.png|Winter Solstice|right|thumb]]

Many Nepalese conflate this festival with the [[Winter Solstice]], and believe that the sun ends its southward journey (Sanskrit: ''[[Dakshinayana]]'') at the Tropic of Capricorn, and starts moving northward (Sanskrit: ''Uttarayaana'') towards the [[Tropic of Cancer]], in the month of ''[[Poush]]'' on this day in mid-January.

While there is no overt solar observance of Winter Solstice in the Nepali religion, the Vaikuntha Ekadashi festival, calculated on the lunar calendar, falls the closest. Further, the Sun makes its northward journey on the day after [[winter solstice]] when day light increases. Therefore, Makar Sankranti signifies the celebration of the day following the day of winter solstice.

Scientifically, currently in the Northern Hemisphere, [[winter solstice]] occurs between 21 and 22 December. Day light will begin to increase on 22 December and on this day, the Sun will begin its northward journey which marks ''Uttarayaan''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://consciousevolution.com/metamorphosis/0212/hindumyth0212.htm Sun - in Hindu Mythology by Anindita Basu]&lt;/ref&gt; The date of winter solstice changes gradually due to the [[Axial precession|Axial precession of the Earth]], coming earlier by approximately 1 day in every 70 years. Hence, if the Maghe Sankranti at some point of time did mark the day after the actual date of winter solstice, a date in mid-January would correspond to around 300CE, the heyday of English mathematics and astronomy.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="12239">In modern usage, metric is used almost exclusively in commercial transactions. These units are mostly historical, although they are still used in some limited contexts and in Maltese idioms and set phrases. Many of these terms are directly related to [[Ancient Arabic weights and measures|Arabic units]] and some to Sicilian units.  The ''Weights and Measures Ordinance'' of 1921 established uniformity in the conversion of such weights and measures. All these measures were defined as simple multiples of the Imperial units then in use in Britain.

== Length ==

Length units were typically used for measuring goods and building sizes. Distances were traditionally measured in terms of travel time, which explains the lack of large-scale units.

== Volume ==

These units were all (except for the cubic units) defined in 1921 relative to the British Imperial gallon, which was defined in the 1824 act. This is equal to 10 pounds of water at a specified temperature and air pressure. This (~4.546 090 31 litres) is slightly larger than the modern definition (exactly 4.546 09 litres).

=== Beer, wine, and spirits measure ===

None of the units from this group are mentioned in TY Maltese.

'''Media stylistics''' or '''mediated stylistics''' is a branch of [[Linguistics#Functional approaches|functional]] [[stylistics (linguistics)|stylistics]] that studies human communication in [[mass media]]. It can be considered a branch of [[media linguistics]]; that is, how media [[speech]] depends on the [[content (media)|content]], aims of communicators and the medium.

Media stylistics as a research approach is widely known in [[Eastern Europe]] and especially in [[Russia]], through the work of A. Vasileva, M. Kozhina, V. Kostomarov, L. Maydanova, I. Lysakova, K. Rogova, G. Solganik and others.

==Main problems==
Modern media stylistics in Russia develops mainly as stylistics of media text. The main particular problems of media stylistics are:
* the correlation between linguistic and extralinguistic organization of media texts;
* the role of the author's voice (G. Solganik, L. Kayda, L. Maydanova, N. Tsvetova, T. Shmeleva), their social (I. Lysakova) and genre (L. Duskaeva; I. Myasnikov; L. Maydanova, S. Kalganova, V. Konkov) typology;
* regularities of speech discovery of media texts as interaction of semantic positions (L. Duskaeva, T. Chernyshova), phatic (N. Kornilova, E. Chepkina, T. Chernyshova), polemic (L. Duskaeva, M. Kormilitsyna) and even hostile (E. Kakorina, V. Salimovsky, A. Skovorodnikov);
* sphere of concepts represented in media texts (E. Abramova, E. Malysheva, O. Orlova), their architectonics and composition (N. Bolotnova, L. Kayda, V. Konkov, N. Kuzmina);
* several expressive characteristics (T. Krasnova, M. Kormilitsyna) or their system (G. Bobrovskaya, G. Kopnina, A. Skovorodnikov; M. Kormilitsyna);
* idiostyle in a speech media environment (N. Bolotnova, M. Kormilitsyna O. Sirotinina), its textual (T. Matveeva) and functional semantics and stylistics (L. Duskaeva, T. Permyakova), intentional stylistics (L. Duskaeva, N. Tsvetova) and intentional (N. Klushina) categories - all those speech properties of texts which promote its effectiveness.

Along with stylistics of socio-political texts (V. Konkov, V. Salimovsky, G. Solganik, N. Klushina), the stylistics of journalistic leisure-texts develops (L. Duskaeva, N. Klushina, V. Konkov, E. Kara-Murza, T. Redkina, N. Tsvetova). The intentional-stylistic approach to the study of these texts develops extensively (V. Barbashov, L. Duskaeva, N. Kornilova, K.Prokhorova, N. Tsvetova) as well as stylistic approach to lingvo-etic problems (N. Bessarabova, T. Surikova, V. Suzdaltseva). As separate lines of media stylistics can be considered semiotic lingvostylistics of advertising texts (E. Kara-Murza), expert media stylistics (A. Baranov, E. Kara-Murza, M. Gorbanevsky, T. Chernyshova), stylistics of online media texts (E. Kakorina, T. Karpova).&lt;ref&gt;Duskaeva L. Media Stylistics: The New Concept or New Phenomenon // [[Russian Journal of Communication]]. 2011. № 4.

The '''Milford Writer's Workshop''', or more properly '''Milford Writers' Conference''', is an annual [[science fiction]] writer's event founded by [[Damon Knight]], among others, in the mid-1950s, in [[Milford, Pennsylvania]]. It was so named because Knight, [[Judith Merril]], and [[James Blish]] lived in [[Milford, Pennsylvania]] when it was founded.{{citation needed|date=April 2015}} It moved to the United Kingdom in 1972 and has run successfully ever since on an annual basis.

==Description==
[[Judith Merril]], [[James Blish]], and [[Damon Knight]] founded the Milford Writer's Conference in 1956.&lt;ref name="latham2009"&gt;{{Cite book |title=The Routledge Companion to Science Fiction |last=Latham |first=Rob |publisher=Routledge |year=2009 |isbn=9781135228361 |editor-last=Bould |editor-first=Mark |pages=80-89 |chapter=Fiction, 1950-1963 |editor-last2=Butler |editor-first2=Andrew M. |editor-last3=Roberts |editor-first3=Adam |editor-last4=Vint |editor-first4=Sherryl |chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=y7CNAgAAQBAJ&amp;lpg=PA82&amp;ots=QpsnWwPrOs&amp;pg=PA80#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=true}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is both a residential workshop and a writers' conference in which published science fiction writers convene over the course of a week to intensively critique stories and samples from novels (usually works in progress) and to workshop ideas on all aspects of SF writing. It is a peer-to-peer conference with no teachers or students.

Milford and related entities like ''[[Science Fiction Forum]]'' presaged the creation of the [[Science Fiction Writers of America]] in 1965 and that decade's [[New Wave (science fiction)|New Wave]] movement.{{r|latham2009}} In 1972, Blish set up the [[United Kingdom]] Milford SF Writers' Conference, which initially met in [[Milford on Sea]], [[Hampshire]]. Since then it has been held in various locations, latterly [[Devon]] until 2001, [[York]] in 2002 and 2003, and (since 2004) at Trigonos Conference Centre in [[North Wales]], usually in mid September.

==Honorary committee==
An honorary committee is elected annually at the AGM held during the Milford week. The 2015 committee (elected 2014) comprised: Sue Thomason (Chair), Liz Williams (Secretary), Tina Anghelatos (Treasurer), Jacey Bedford (Vice-Chair, Website and Mailing Lists), Kari Sperring, and Karen Williams. Committee members are listed on the workshop's official web site.

==Participants==
Participants must have sold at least one science fiction story to qualify for attendance, and relative newcomers to publication are welcomed, though participants often have multiple novel and/or short story sales to their credit. Qualification details are quoted on the workshop's official website.

== Milford rules ==
Manuscripts are distributed beforehand. Everyone reads, critiques, and prepares before the formal workshop begins. Etiquette precludes participants from discussing the manuscripts beforehand either with the author or other members of the critique group. The participants sit round in a circle. The author whose work is being critiqued has to sit in silence through the first part in which each participant in turn is allowed an uninterrupted four minutes (timed) to deliver their critique. Then the author gets an uninterrupted right to reply. Following that a general discussion ensues. Constructive criticism is strongly encouraged. In the last few years it has become accepted for the critiqued manuscripts to be given back to the author complete with notes.

The so-called "Milford method" has been adopted by several writers' groups, including the [[Glasgow Science Fiction Writers Circle]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://gsfwc.wordpress.com/ |title=Glasgow Science Fiction Writers Circle website |date=April 30, 2011 |access-date= 7 September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{nihongo|'''''Onechanbara Z2: Chaos'''''|お姉チャンバラZ2 ～カオス～|OneeChanbara Z2}} is a 2014 [[Action game|Action]]–[[Hack and slash]] [[video game]] developed by [[Tamsoft]], as part of the ''[[OneeChanbara]]'' series. It is the sequel to the Japan-exclusive [[Xbox 360]] title ''OneeChanbara Z ~ Kagura ~'' (which was later re-released for [[PlayStation 3]] in 2013), and the first game in the series to be localized since ''[[OneChanbara: Bikini Zombie Slayers]]'' and ''[[Onechanbara: Bikini Samurai Squad]]'' in 2009.

==Gameplay==
The Gameplay has been compared to ''[[Bayonetta]]'', and revolves around hack and slash combat. Throughout the game, two sets of playable characters can be swapped with on the fly, each boasting their own unique attacks and abilities (the characters at hand depend on the given stage). Throughout the game, players will earn yellow orbs, which act as a form of currency. These orbs may be exchanged for new combat moves and gear.

Players will battle a variety of enemies, mainly zombies, werewolves, ghouls and demons. In order to defeat these foes, weapons such as swords, chainsaws, and guns are available. Slaying enemies will result in the dismemberment of limbs, as well as an in-game combo.

After completing a level, the user is graded on their performance throughout the stage. Factors such as combo length, amount of items used, damage dealt and damage received can all affect this score in a positive and negative manner. These scores can also be submitted to the worldwide leader boards.

==Plot==
{{tone|date=January 2016}}
The Banefuls and the Vampirics are two ancient rival demonic bloodlines. After the numbers of both factions dwindled to almost nothing it was thought that the blood feud was over, until now.

After the Vampiric sisters Kagura and Saaya defeated their treacherous adoptive mother, the Vampire Queen Carmilla, at the end of the last game, aided from the shadows by Aya and Saki, two legendary zombie-hunting sisters of Baneful blood, the truce came to an abrupt end and the two sets of sisters could restrain themselves no longer.

Carmilla's throne room became a battleground once again as the two pairs of sisters battled for supremacy. The battle, however, was undecided, as the floor beneath them collapsed sending the four into the abyss below, but not before glancing a mysterious, slender, green-haired woman now sitting in Carmilla's throne.

The girls become separated from their respective sisters and are pushed into uneasy alliances for survival. In the catacombs beneath the castle, Kagura is forced to drink Aya's blood in order to regenerate after she is critically injured by demonic moles being kept in the castle's depths. The fusion of the two bloodlines within Kagura's body allows her to temporarily transform into a powerful new form, Dare Drive, slaying all who stand before her.

Saaya and Saki are thrust into a pocket hell-dimension but are able to escape by co-operating to defeat the waves of undead blocking their exit. They escape to the castle village but are attacked by a masked undead assassin known as Misha. Misha bests the girls and seriously injures Saaya. Kagura and Aya reunite with them and advise Saaya to feed on Saki's blood in order to recover and transform into her own Dare Drive. This works, and the four girls work together to force Misha to retreat and slay her undead entourage.

Now working together, the girls are advised by their friend Anna of the Zombie Prevention Force (ZPF) to wipe out several zombie outbreaks around the world and eliminate several high-profile targets. The attacks are revealed to be diversions to keep the girls at bay whilst Misha locates the ZPF Headquarters and slaughters and zombifies the personnel within. Fortunately, being a field operative, Anna is absent and evades the attack.

The four girls arrive at the scene where the results of Kagura and Saaya's vampiric bites finally take their effects on Aya and Saki's Baneful bodies, granting them similar transformations known as Xtatics. The four cut their way through floor after floor of zombified ZPF whilst chasing Misha. On the rooftop, the green-haired woman escapes by helicopter, leaving the party to battle Misha. With their enhanced abilities, the girls are able to defeat Misha once and for all.

The mortally wounded Misha falls from the rooftop as her mask shatters, revealing that she was in fact Misery, a rival Baneful and loose ally of Aya and Saki's late nemesis, Himiko. Misery was slain a year previously by Aya and Saki to end her insane bloodlust, and was subsequently resurrected by the green-haired woman.

Anna contacts the party with news that the green-haired woman has returned to Carmilla's castle. The girls follow, and attempt the evade the awaiting zombie army by navigating a network of underground tunnels. Despite many traps set for them, the girls successfully confront the green-haired woman in the now restored throne room.

The woman identifies herself as Evangeline, or 'Evange' for short, and reveals her goal of creating a world for both the Banefuls and Vampirics; a world she aims to create by fusing the bloodlines, much like the party did previously. Evange offers the girls a place in her utopia, but soon withdraws her offer when she realizes the girls still intend to kill her. Evange attacks the party, using her own fused blood to transform, but the party emerges victorious and slays her.

The girls agree to put the ancient blood feud behind them and make their alliance permanent. Later, Anna contacts the girls and reveals Evange's origins. Evange was a researcher working for Carmilla who used the castle's facilities to further her own cause. She was also Misery's older sister.

}}

''Onechanbara Z2: Chaos'' received mixed reviews from critics, currently averaging a 59.22% on [[GameRankings]] and a 59/100 on [[Metacritic]], respectively.&lt;ref name="GR" /&gt;&lt;ref name="MC" /&gt; Praise was given to the games character models and addictive combat, while criticism was drawn to its dated environmental graphics.

The game fared well with [[Famitsu]] reviewers, whose combined scores added to a 31/40 (8/8/8/7).&lt;ref name ="Fam" /&gt;

Kyle MacGregor of [[Destructoid]] awarded the game a 5.5/10. MacGregor praised the game's combat, character designs, and sexual fan service, while taking issue to the "linear and repetitive mission structure", and also disliking the enemy AI, commenting that they simply rely on sheer size to pose any sort of challenge.&lt;ref name="Destructoid"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.destructoid.com/review-onechanbara-z2-chaos-296317.phtml |title=Review: Onechanbara Z2: Chaos |publisher=[[Destructoid]] |accessdate=August 22, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Hardcore Gamer|Hardcore Gamer's]] Adam Beck was highly critical of the game. Despite giving applause to the high level of customization and fluid swordplay, he felt the poor dialog, bad mission structure, repetitive combat and short game length brought the game experience down, awarding the game a 4/10. He did however call ''Onechanbara Z2: Chaos'' one of the better entries in the series.&lt;ref name="HcG"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.hardcoregamer.com/2015/07/21/review-onechanbara-z2-chaos/159259/ |title=Review: Onechanbara Z2: Chaos |publisher=[[Hardcore Gamer]] |accessdate=August 22, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Penny Arcade]] featured the game in a "First 15" video feature, and found little to like.&lt;ref name="Penny Arcade"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://penny-arcade.com/patv/episode/onechanbara-z2-chaos |title=First 15: Onechanbara Z2: Chaos |publisher=[[Penny Arcade]] |accessdate=October 26, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The "First 15" segments feature writer [[Jerry Holkins]] and artist [[Mike Krahulik]] playing a game for fifteen minutes, and provide a record of their reactions and reflections on the game being played. Holkins and Krahulik were uniformly negative, citing feelings of disgust while playing. They criticized the character modeling of the enemies, the costumes of the protagonists, the gameplay, and the spirit of the game. Unaware that the game was part of a franchise, and clearly unfamiliar with the more sexually liberated media of Japan, Krahulik wondered what audience the game was meant to appeal to, implying that the game could not possibly sell well.

Matt Sainsbury, reviewing for DigitallyDownloaded.net, gave the game a 9/10, saying that while technical bugs existed, such as a sometimes poor camera, they never detracted from the fast paced combat.&lt;ref name="DD.net"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.digitallydownloaded.net/2015/08/review-onechanbara-z2-chaos-sony.html |title=Review: Onechanbara Z2: Chaos (Sony PlayStation 4) |publisher=Digitally Downloaded |accessdate=August 22, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Ostia Synagogue''' is an ancient synagogue located in [[Ostia Antica|ancient Ostia]], the seaport of Imperial [[Rome]]. It is one of the [[Oldest synagogues in the World|oldest synagogue]]s in the world, the oldest synagogue in Europe and the oldest mainstream [[Jewish]] synagogue yet uncovered outside [[Israel]].  The synagogue building dates from the reign of [[Claudius]] (41-54 AD) and continued in use as a synagogue into the 5th century AD.&lt;ref name="Delos"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pohick.org/sts/ostia.html|title=Ostia|website=Second Temple Synagogues|first=Donald|last=Binder|publisher=Pohick Church}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"Synagogue and Society in Imperial Ostia: Archaeological and Epigraphic Evidence," [[L. Michael White]] ''The Harvard Theological Review,'' Vol. 90, No. 1 (Jan., 1997), pp. 23-58&lt;/ref&gt;  

There is a scholarly debate about the status of the synagogue building in the 1st century AD, with some maintaining that the building began as a house only later converted to use as a synagogue, and others arguing that it was in use as a synagogue from the 1st century.&lt;ref&gt;The Ancient Synagogue: The First Thousand Years, By Lee I. Levine, Edition: 2,  Yale University Press, 2005, pp. 274ff&lt;/ref&gt;

In its earliest form, the synagogue featured a main hall with benches along three walls; a propyleum or monumental gateway featuring four marble columns; and a triclineum or dining room with couches along three walls.  There was a water well and basin near the entryway for ritual washings. The main door of the synagogue faces the southeast, towards [[Jerusalem]].&lt;ref name="Delos"/&gt;  

An [[aedicula]], to serve as a [[Torah Ark]], was added  in the 4th century AD. A donor inscription implies that it replaced an earlier wooden platform donated in the 2nd century AD, which itself had been replaced by a newer Ark donated by one Mindus Faustus in the 3rd century AD.&lt;ref name="Delos"/&gt;

Traditional Ottawa stories fall into two general categories, [[Anishinaabe traditional beliefs#Aadizookaan|aasookaan]] 'legend, sacred story' (plural ''aasookaanag'')&lt;ref&gt;Rhodes, Richard, 1985, 14&lt;/ref&gt; and ''dbaajmowin'' 'narrative, story' (plural ''dbaajmownan'').&lt;ref&gt;Rhodes, Richard, 1985, 103&lt;/ref&gt; Stories in the ''aasookaan'' category involve mythical characters such as [[Nanabozho|Nenbozh]].&lt;ref&gt;Valentine, J. Randolph, 1988, 197-215; 113-115&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Piggott, Glyne, 1985, 11-16&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Piggott, Glyne, 1985a, 13-16&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Nichols 1991"&gt;Nichols, John and Leonard Bloomfield, 1991, 18-23&lt;/ref&gt; Stories in the ''dbaajmowin'' category include traditional stories that do not necessarily involve mythical characters,&lt;ref&gt;Piggott, Glyne, 1985a, 1-12&lt;/ref&gt; with the same term also used more generally to refer to any type of story not in the ''aasookaan'' category. Published Ottawa text material includes a range of genres, including historical narratives,&lt;ref&gt;Piggott, Glyne, 1985, 1-10&lt;/ref&gt; stories of conflict with other indigenous groups,&lt;ref&gt;McGregor, Gregor with C. F. Voegelin, 1988, 114-118&lt;/ref&gt; humorous stories,&lt;ref&gt;Fox, Francis and Nora Soney with Richard Rhodes, 1988&lt;/ref&gt; and others.&lt;ref name="Nichols 1991"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Wilder, Julie, ed. 1999&lt;/ref&gt;

==Text==
Ottawa speaker Andrew Medler dictated the following text while he was working with [[Leonard Bloomfield]] in a linguistic [[Field work|field methods]] class at the [[Linguistic Society of America#Linguistic institutes|Linguistic Institute]] of the [[Linguistic Society of America]], held during the summer of 1938 at the [[University of Michigan]] in [[Ann Arbor, Michigan]].&lt;ref&gt;Bloomfield, Leonard, 1958, p. vii&lt;/ref&gt; Medler grew up near [[Saginaw, Michigan|Saginaw]], Michigan but spent most of his life at Walpole Island.&lt;ref&gt;Bloomfield, Leonard, 1958, p. viii&lt;/ref&gt; The texts that Medler dictated were originally published in a linguistically oriented transcription using phonetic symbols, and have been republished in the modern orthography, with analysis.&lt;ref&gt;Valentine, J. Randolph, 1998, pp. 57, 167, 239-240&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Love Medicine'''&lt;br /&gt;
''Andrew Medler''&lt;br /&gt;
{{quotation|(1) Ngoding kiwenziinh ngii-noondwaaba a-dbaajmod wshkiniigkwen gii-ndodmaagod iw wiikwebjigan.
:''Once I heard an old man tell of how a young woman asked him for love medicine.''

:''She was in love with a young man.''

:''Then this young woman used that medicine that she had bought.''

(5) Mii dash maaba wshkinwe gaa-zhi-gchi-zaaghaad niw wshkiniigkwen.&lt;br /&gt;
:''Then this young man accordingly very much loved that young woman.''

(6) Gye go mii gii-wiidgemaad, gye go mii wiiba gii-yaawaawaad binoojiinyan.&lt;br /&gt;
:''Then he married her; very soon they had children.

(7) Aapji go gii-zaaghidwag gye go gii-maajiishkaawag.&lt;br /&gt;
:''They loved each other and they fared very well.''}}

==Analysis of text==
Below is an [[interlinear gloss]]ing and analysis of the words in each sentence, with lines of analysis being vertically aligned on a word-by-word basis. For each sentence the first line presents the text, the second presents a morphological analysis, the third line presents a translation of the elements identified in line 2, and the fourth line presents a word-by-word translation. A more detailed morphological analysis is also available.&lt;ref&gt;Valentine, J. Randolph, 1998, pp. 239-240&lt;/ref&gt; A table of codes for grammatical elements used in interlinear glossing occurs after the glossed sentences.&lt;ref&gt;Valentine, J. Randolph, 1998, pp. xiii-xiv; 217&lt;/ref&gt;

In the first line the hyphen '-' is used to mark the division between a [[Ojibwe grammar#Verbs|preverb]] and an immediately following verb, as in Sentence 1: ''ngii-noondwaaba'' 'I heard it,' with past tense preverb ''gii-''; or a preverb followed by another preverb, as in Sentence 5, ''gaa-zhi-gchi-zaaghaad,'' where the first two hyphens indicate the boundaries between preverbs, and the third hyphen indicates the boundary between a preverb and a verb. In the second line, where morphological analysis is presented, the hyphen marks the start of a suffix, as in ''wshkiniigkwe-n'' 'young.man' followed by [[Ojibwe grammar|Obviative]] suffix ''-n.'' Also in the second line, the marker '=' indicates the boundary between a verb and a following verb or preverb.

'''''Prophets of Science Fiction''''' is an American [[documentary television]] series produced and hosted by [[Ridley Scott]] for the [[Science (TV network)|Science Channel]]. The program premiered on {{Start date|2011|11|09}}.

The series covers the life and work of leading [[science fiction]] authors of the last couple of centuries.&lt;ref name="About the Show"&gt;{{cite web|title=About the Show|url=http://science.discovery.com/tv/prophets-of-science-fiction/about-show.html|publisher=''Science'' channel|accessdate=5 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; It depicts how they predicted and, accordingly, influenced the development of scientific advancements by inspiring many readers to assist in transforming those futuristic visions into everyday reality. The stories are told through film clips, reenactments, illustrations and interviews.&lt;ref name=Teague&gt;{{cite news|last=Teague|first=Jason Cranford|title=The Prophets of Science Fiction Explores Sci-Fi’s Best Writers|url=https://www.wired.com/geekdad/2011/11/ridley-scott-brings-us-the-prophets-of-science-fiction/|accessdate=5 December 2011|newspaper=[[Wired (magazine)|Wired]]|date=9 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Portier mit Zylinder.JPG|thumb|A [[hotel porter]] is an example of a service-related occupation.]]
In [[economics]], a '''service''' is a transaction in which no physical goods are transferred from the seller to the buyer. The benefits of such a service are held to be demonstrated by the buyer's willingness to make the exchange. Public services are those that society (nation state, fiscal union, region) as a whole pays for. Using [[resource]]s, [[skill]], [[ingenuity]], and [[experience]], service providers benefit service consumers. Service is intangible in nature.

==Three I's==

Services can be described in terms of I's.

===Intangibility===

Services are by definition intangible. They are not manufactured, transported or stocked.

Services cannot be stored for a future use. They are produced and consumed simultaneously.

Services are perishable in two regards:
* Service-relevant resources, processes and systems are assigned for service delivery during a specific period in time. If the service consumer does not request and consume the service during this period, the related resources may go unused. From the perspective of the service provider, this is a lost [[business opportunity]] if no other use for those resources is available. Examples: A hairdresser serves another client. An empty seat on an airplane cannot be filled after departure.
* When the service has been completely rendered to the consumer, this particular service irreversibly vanishes. Example: a passenger has been transported to the destination.
The service provider must deliver the service at the time of service consumption. The service is not manifested in a physical object that is independent of the provider. The service consumer is also inseparable from service delivery. Examples: The service consumer must sit in the hairdresser's chair, or in the airplane seat. Correspondingly, the hairdresser or the pilot must be in the shop or plane, respectively, to deliver the service.

===Inconsistency (variability)===

Each service is unique. It can never be exactly repeated as the time, location, circumstances, conditions, current configurations and/or as signed resources are different for the next delivery, even if the same service consumer requests the same service. Many services are regarded as heterogeneous and are typically modified for each service consumer or each service contextual . Example: The taxi service which transports the service consumer from home to work is different from the taxi service which transports the same service consumer from work to home – another point in time, the other direction, possibly another route, probably another taxi driver and cab. Another and more common term for this is heterogeneity.

===Involvement===

Both service provider and service consumer participate in the service providers

==Service quality==
[[Mass generation]] and delivery of services must be mastered for a service provider to expand. This can be seen as a problem of [[service quality]]. Both inputs and outputs to the processes involved providing services are highly variable, as are the relationships between these processes, making it difficult to maintain consistent service quality. Many services involve variable human activity, rather than a precisely determined process; exceptions include [[Public utility|utilities]]. The human factor is often the key success factor in service provision. Demand can vary by [[season]], [[time]] of day, [[business cycle]], etc. Consistency is necessary to create enduring business relationships.

==Specification==
Any service can be clearly and completely, consistently and concisely specified by means of standard attributes that conform to the [[MECE principle]] (Mutually Exclusive, Collectively Exhaustive).

* Service consumer benefits – (set of) benefits that are triggerable, consumable and effectively utilizable for any authorized service consumer and that are rendered upon request. These benefits must be described in terms that are meaningful to consumers.
* Service-specific functional parameters – parameters that are essential to the respective service and that describe the important dimension(s) of the [[servicescape]], the service output or the service outcome, e.g. whether the passenger sits in an aisle or window seat.
* Service delivery point – the physical location and/or logical interface where the benefits of the service are rendered to the consumer. At this point the service delivery preparation can be assessed and delivery can be monitored and controlled.
* Service consumer count – the number of consumers that are enabled to consume a service.
* Service delivery readiness time – the moments when the service is available and all the specified service elements are available at the delivery point
* Service consumer support times – the moments when the support team ("service desk") is available. The service desk is the Single Point of Contact (SPoC) for service inquiries. At those times, the service desk can be reached via commonly available communication methods (phone, web, etc.) 
* Service consumer support language – the language(s) spoken by the service desk.
* Service fulfillment target – the provider's promise to deliver the service, expressed as the ratio of the count of successful service deliveries to the count of service requests by a single consumer or consumer group over some time period.
* Service impairment duration – the maximum allowable interval between the first occurrence of a service impairment and the full resumption and completion of the service delivery.
* Service delivery duration – the maximum allowable period for effectively rendering all service benefits to the consumer.
* Service delivery unit – the scope/number of action(s) that constitute a delivered service.Serves as the reference object for the Service Delivering Price, for all service costs as well as for charging and billing.
* Service delivery price – the amount of money the customer pays to receive a service. Typically, the price includes a service access price that qualifies the consumer to request the service and a service consumption price for each delivered service.

==Delivery==

[[File:StarbucksVaughanMills.JPG|thumb|Coffee house - a type of service delivery.]]
The delivery of a service typically involves six factors:
* Service provider (workers and managers)
* Equipment used to provide the service (e.g. vehicles, cash registers, technical systems, computer systems)
* Physical facilities (e.g. buildings, parking, waiting rooms)
* Service consumer
* Other customers at the service delivery location
* Customer contact

The service encounter is defined as all activities involved in the service delivery process. Some service managers use the term "moment of truth" to indicate that point in a service encounter where interactions are most intense.

Many [[list of business theorists|business theorists]] view service provision as a performance or act (sometimes humorously referred to as ''dramalurgy'', perhaps in reference to [[dramaturgy]]). The location of the service delivery is referred to as the [[Stage (theatre)|stage]] and the objects that facilitate the service process are called [[Theatrical property|props]]. A script is a sequence of [[behavior]]s followed by those involved, including the client(s). Some service [[drama]]s are tightly scripted, others are more [[ad libitum|ad lib]]. Role congruence occurs when each [[actor]] follows a script that harmonizes with the [[role]]s played by the other actors.

In some service industries, especially health care, dispute resolution and social services, a popular concept is the idea of the caseload, which refers to the total number of patients, clients, litigants, or claimants for which a given employee is responsible. Employees must balance the needs of each individual case against the needs of all other current cases as well as their own needs.

Under [[English law]], if a service provider is induced to deliver services to a [[dishonesty|dishonest]] client by a deception, this is an offence under the [[Theft Act 1978]].

Lovelock used the number of delivery sites (whether single or multiple) and the method of delivery to classify services in a 2 x 3 matrix. Then implications are that the convenience of receiving the service is the lowest when the customer has to come to the service and must use a single or specific outlet. Convenience increases (to a point) as the number of service points increase.

==Service-commodity goods continuum==
[[File:Service-goods continuum.png|thumb|Service-Commodity Goods continuum]]

The distinction between a good and a service remains disputed. The perspective in the late-eighteenth and early-nineteenth centuries focused on creation and possession of wealth. Classical economists contended that goods were objects of value over which ownership rights could be established and exchanged. Ownership implied tangible possession of an object that had been acquired through purchase, barter or gift from the producer or previous owner and was legally identifiable as the property of the current owner.

[[Adam Smith]]’s famous book, ''[[The Wealth of Nations]]'', published in [[1776]], distinguished between the outputs of what he termed "productive" and "unproductive" labor. The former, he stated, produced goods that could be stored after production and subsequently exchanged for money or other items of value. The latter, however useful or necessary, created services that perished at the time of production and therefore did not contribute to wealth. Building on this theme, French economist Jean-Baptiste Say argued that production and consumption were inseparable in services, coining the term "immaterial products" to describe them.

Most modern business theorists describe a continuum with pure service on one terminal point and pure [[commodity|commodity good]] on the other.&lt;ref&gt;Anders Gustofsson and Michael D. Johnson, Competing in a Service Economy (SanFrancisco: Josey-Bass, 2003), p.7.&lt;/ref&gt; Most [[product (business)|products]] fall between these two extremes. For example, a [[restaurant]] provides a physical good (the [[food]]), but also provides services in the form of ambience, the setting and clearing of the table, etc. And although some utilities actually deliver physical goods — like water utilities that deliver water — utilities are usually treated as services.

In a narrower sense, service refers to [[Quality (business)|quality]] of [[customer service]]: the measured appropriateness of assistance and support provided to a customer. This particular usage occurs frequently in [[retailing]].

[[Image:Ptolemaeus - Quadripartitum, 1622 - 4658973.tif|thumb|''Quadripartitum'', 1622]]
'''''Tetrabiblos''''' ({{lang|grc|Τετράβιβλος}}) 'four books', also known in [[Ancient Greek|Greek]] as  '''''Apotelesmatiká''''' ({{lang|grc|Ἀποτελεσματικά}}) "Effects", and in [[Latin]] as '''''Quadripartitum''''' "Four Parts", is a text on the philosophy and practice of [[astrology]], written in the 2nd century AD by the [[Alexandria]]n scholar [[Ptolemy|Claudius Ptolemy]] ({{circa}} AD 90–{{circa}} AD 168).

Ptolemy's ''[[Almagest]]'' was an authoritative text on [[astronomy]] for more than a thousand years, and the ''Tetrabiblos'', its companion volume, was equally influential in [[astrology]], the study of the effects of astronomical cycles on earthly matters.  But whilst the ''Almagest'' as an astronomical authority was superseded by acceptance of the [[heliocentric model]] of the [[solar system]], the ''Tetrabiblos'' remains an important theoretical work for astrology.

Besides outlining the techniques of astrological practice, Ptolemy's philosophical defense of the subject as a natural, beneficial study helped secure theological tolerance towards astrology in [[Western Europe]] during the [[Medieval era]]. This allowed Ptolemaic teachings on astrology to be included in universities during the [[Renaissance]], which brought an associated impact upon medical studies and literary works.
 
The historical importance of the ''Tetrabiblos'' is seen by the many ancient, Medieval and Renaissance commentaries that have been published about it. It was copied, commented on, paraphrased, abridged, and translated into many languages. The latest critical Greek edition, by Wolfgang Hübner, was published by [[Teubner]] in 1998.

[[Ptolemy]] is referred to as "the most famous of Greek astrologers"&lt;ref name="tester57"&gt;[[#Reference-Tester-1987|Tester (1987)]]  [https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=L0HSvH96alIC&amp;lpg=PA57&amp;dq=Tester%20Ptolemy&amp;pg=PA57#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false p.57].&lt;/ref&gt; and "a pro-astrological authority of the highest magnitude".&lt;ref name="Rutkin"&gt;Rutkin, H. Darrel, 'The Use and Abuse of Ptolemy's Tetrabiblos in Renaissance and Early Modern Europe', in [[#Reference-Jones-2010|Jones (2010)]] p.135-147.&lt;/ref&gt; As a source of reference his ''Tetrabiblos'' is described as having "enjoyed almost the authority of a Bible among the astrological writers of a thousand years or more".&lt;ref&gt;[[#Reference-Robbins_Tet|Robbins (1940)]] 'Translator's Introduction' [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Ptolemy/Tetrabiblos/Introduction*.html II, p.xii]. Analogies between the status of the ''Tetrabiblos'' in astrology and the Bible in Christianity are frequent. See for example [[#Reference-Riley|Riley (1974)]] p.235, "virtually the Bible of astrology"; Broughton, ''Elements of Astrology'' (1898) p.7: "Ptolemy’s Four Books on Astrology are to the European and American Student what the Bible is to the student of Christian Theology";  Tucker, ''Principles of Scientific Astrology'' (1938) p.32: "it is the ''Tetrabiblos'' which interests astrologers ... it is their astrological bible"; and Zusne, Jones, ''Anomalistic psychology: a study of magical thinking'' (1989) p.201: "the astrologer's bible, the Tetrabiblos, is still in use in the Western world".&lt;/ref&gt;  Compiled in [[Alexandria]] in the 2nd century, the work gathered commentaries about it from its first publication.&lt;ref name="tester57" /&gt; It was translated into [[Arabic]] in the 9th century, and is described as "by far the most influential source of medieval Islamic astrology".&lt;ref&gt;[[#Reference-Saliba|Saliba (1997)]]  [https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=mOquCzBX3xcC&amp;lpg=PA67&amp;dq=Tetrabiblos%20Arabs&amp;pg=PA67#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false p.67].&lt;/ref&gt;

With the translation of the ''Tetrabiblos'' into Latin in the 12th century, "Ptolemaic astrology" became integrated by [[Albertus Magnus]] and [[Thomas Aquinas]] into medieval [[Christianity|Christian]] doctrine.&lt;ref name="Tarnas"&gt;[[#Reference-Tarnas|Tarnas (1991)]]  [https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=-YIIRXtokSsC&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;pg=PA193#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false pp.193–194].&lt;/ref&gt; This [[Theology|theological]] acceptance encouraged the teaching of Ptolemaic astrology in universities, often linked to medical studies. This, in turn, brought attention in literary works, such as [[Dante]]'s, which helped shape the [[Morality|moral]], religious and [[Cosmos|cosmological]] [[Paradigm shift#Science and paradigm shift|paradigm]] of [[Western Europe]] during the [[Medieval era]].&lt;ref name="Tarnas" /&gt;  The ''Tetrabiblos'' was largely responsible for laying down  the basic precepts of [[Renaissance]] astrology,&lt;ref&gt;[[#Reference-Webster|Webster (1979)]]  [https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=g588AAAAIAAJ&amp;lpg=PA276&amp;dq=Ptolemy%20Tetrabiblos%2016th%20century&amp;pg=PA276#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false p.276].&lt;/ref&gt; and was a necessary textbook in some of the finest universities of Renaissance and [[early modern Europe]].&lt;ref name="Rutkin" /&gt;  
[[File:Claudius ptolemaius.jpg|upright|thumb|left|16th-century woodcut depicting Ptolemy, from ''Les vrais portraits et vies des hommes illustres'', Paris, 1584, f°87.]]
Ptolemaic astrology continued to be taught at European universities into the 17th century,&lt;ref name="Rutkin" /&gt;  but by the mid-17th century the study struggled to maintain its position as one of the respected [[Liberal sciences]].&lt;ref&gt;See [[#Reference-Ramesey|Ramesey (1654)]] bk. I 'A vindication of astrology', p.2, which presents a lengthy argument for why astrology is defined as a "Mathematical art", being neither "a distinct Art or Science by itself" but "one of the Liberal Sciences". See also [[#Reference-Thorndike|Thorndike (1958)]] vol. 12, ch.5: 'Astrology to 1650', and [[#Reference-Thomas|Thomas (1971)]] ch.3: 'Astrology: its social and intellectual role' which describes the determined efforts to preserve the intellectual standing of astrology in the mid-late 17th century, which rapidly collapsed at the end of that century.&lt;/ref&gt; At this time, the contents of the ''Tetrabiblos'' started to draw stigmatisation as part of "a diabolical art of divination". One 17th-century critic was to write of its subject: "no superstitious art is more fitted to forward the aims of the devil than the astrology of Ptolemy".{{Citation needed|date=May 2018}}

The intellectual standing of astrology collapsed rapidly at the end of the 17th century, but the historical impact of the ''Tetrabiblos'' upon world culture continues to engage the attention of scholars of [[classical philosophy]] and the [[History of science in classical antiquity|history of sciences in antiquity]].&lt;ref&gt;[[#Reference-Lehoux|Lehoux (2006)]] p.108: "Perhaps the most influential of the ancient physical accounts is that offered by Ptolemy in his ''Tetrabiblos''".&lt;/ref&gt; It also maintains its position as an influential textbook for practitioners of modern western astrology, and English translations of the text were published by [[astrologer]]s in the 18th, 19th and 20th centuries.&lt;ref&gt;For example, the Whalley translation (1701), and 'corrected edition' by Ebenezer Sibly and his brother (1786); James Wilson (1828), and other privately circulated manuscripts of the 19th century such as that produced by John Worsdale; the [[Project Hindsight]] translation by Robert Schmidt (1994).  Details of these texts and other translations are given in the section on [[Tetrabiblos#Editions and translations|Editions and translations]].&lt;/ref&gt; The early 20th-century [[Humanism|Humanist]] astrologer [[Dane Rudhyar]] reported that the astrology of his era "originated almost entirely in the work of the Alexandrian astrologer, Claudius Ptolemy".&lt;ref&gt;[[#Reference-Rudhyar|Rudhyar (1936)]] [https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=dApyUYhq4-4C&amp;lpg=PR2&amp;dq=Rudhyar%20astrology%20of%20personality&amp;pg=PA4#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false p.4].&lt;/ref&gt; Even 21st-century astrological textbooks have described the ''Tetrabiblos'' as being "without a doubt, indispensable for any serious student of astrology".&lt;ref&gt;[[#Reference-Avelar-2010|Avelar and Ribeiro (2010)]] 'Annotated Bibliography' p.275: "This is an astrological classic and probably the most widely cited in the history of the art. It is one of the most important and influential works in the field of astrology ... without a doubt, indispensable for any serious student of astrology".&lt;/ref&gt;

The work's enduring significance is attributed to several factors: Ptolemy's reputation as one of the greatest philosophers and scientists of the ancient world,&lt;ref&gt;[[#Reference-Ashmand|Ashmand (1822)]] 'Translator's Introduction'.&lt;/ref&gt; the text's astrological importance as one of the oldest complete manuals on that subject,&lt;ref name="Houlding"&gt;[[#Reference-Houlding-1993|Houlding (1993)]] p.3.&lt;/ref&gt; and the unprecedented order and quality of Ptolemy's astrological explanations.&lt;ref name="Riley"&gt;[[#Reference-Riley88|Riley (1988)]]  p.69.&lt;/ref&gt;

The "outstanding mark of Ptolemy’s astrology" is described as "informed by the philosophical and scientific spirit of his age".&lt;ref name="tester60"&gt;[[#Reference-Tester-1987|Tester (1987)]]  [https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=L0HSvH96alIC&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;dq=Tester%20Astrology&amp;pg=PA60#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false p.60].&lt;/ref&gt; Ptolemy wrote at a time when "physics" was defined by [[philosophy]], and his account of stellar effects was expressed in terms of the four Aristotelian qualities (hot, cold, wet, and dry) set against the philosophical notion of [[Macrocosm and microcosm|universal unity]] and [[Musica universalis|cosmic harmony]].&lt;ref&gt;[[#Reference-Tester-1987|Tester (1987)]]  [https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=L0HSvH96alIC&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;dq=Tester%20Astrology&amp;pg=PA59#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false p.59]; [[#Reference-Lehoux|Lehoux (2006)]] pp.107-109.&lt;/ref&gt; His objective was to explain the rationale of astrology in such terms, so the work is also notable for its dismissal of astrological practices which lack a direct astronomical basis:&lt;ref&gt;[[#Reference-Tester-1987|Tester (1987)]]  [https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=L0HSvH96alIC&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;dq=Tester%20Astrology&amp;pg=PA64#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false p.64].&lt;/ref&gt;
{{quote|As for the nonsense on which many waste their labour and of which not even a plausible account can be given, this we shall dismiss in favour of the primary natural causes; we shall investigate, not by means of lots and numbers of which no reasonable explanation can be given, but merely through the science of the aspects of the stars to the places with which they have familiarity.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Reference-Robbins_Tet|''Tetrabiblos'']] III.3 (Loeb: [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Ptolemy/Tetrabiblos/3A*.html#3 p.237]).&lt;/ref&gt;}}
The book opens with an explanation of the philosophical framework of astrology which aims to answer the arguments of critics who questioned the subject's  validity.&lt;ref name="Houlding" /&gt;  Of this, [[Lynn Thorndike]], in his ''History of Magic and Experimental Science'', writes: "Only the opponents of astrology appear to have remained ignorant of the ''Tetrabiblos'', continuing to make criticisms of the art which do not apply to Ptolemy's presentation of it or which had been specifically answered by him".&lt;ref&gt;[[#Reference-Thorndike|Thorndike (1958)]] vol. 1, p.116.&lt;/ref&gt;

Ptolemy was not responsible for originating the astrological techniques he presented in the ''Tetrabiblos''.&lt;ref name="tester60" /&gt;  His contribution was to arrange the material systematically, in order to demonstrate that astrology is based upon logical, hierarchical principles.&lt;ref name="Houlding" /&gt;  Astrological influences are frequently referred to the meteorological effects of humoral shifts, which were presumed to result from celestial cycles bringing correlated changes in the heating, cooling, moistening, and drying affects of the atmosphere.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Reference-Avelar-2010|Avelar and Ribeiro (2010)]] ch.2, pp.10–17. See for example[[#Reference-Robbins_Tet|''Tetrabiblos'']] [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Ptolemy/Tetrabiblos/1B*.html#4 I.4]: 'Of the Power of the Planets'.&lt;/ref&gt;

The historical importance and influence of the ''Tetrabiblos'' is attested by the many ancient, Medieval and Renaissance commentaries  published about it, as well as the many translations and paraphrased editions that aim to reproduce its content in an accessible manner.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Reference-Robbins_Tet|Robbins (1940)]] 'Translator's Introduction', [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Ptolemy/Tetrabiblos/Introduction*.html III, pp.xvi–xvii.]&lt;/ref&gt; The Greek text has undergone transmission into Arabic, Latin and many modern languages. The first English translation did not appear until the 18th century, but by the end of the 19th century the American astrologer Luke Broughton reported he had at least half a dozen different English translations in his possession.&lt;ref&gt;''Elements of Astrology'' (1898) [https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=67WarAlhu-YC&amp;q=Tetrabiblos#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false p.7]. Broughton describes its value to astrologers as "One of the best books the student should read, and which is most essential" p.v.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Title and date of composition==

The commonly known Greek and Latin titles  (''Tetrabiblos'' and ''Quadripartitum'' respectively), meaning 'four books', are  traditional nicknames&lt;ref name="J1"&gt;[[#Reference-Jones-2010|Jones (2010)]] 'Introduction' by Alexander Jones, p.xii: "The ''Tetrabiblos'' (again a nickname - we do not know Ptolemy's own title, but a credible guess is ''Apotelesmatika'', roughly 'Astrological Influences')".&lt;/ref&gt; for a work which in some Greek manuscripts is entitled {{lang|grc|Μαθηματικὴ τετράβιβλος σύνταξις}}, 'Mathematical treatise in four books'.&lt;ref name="R1"&gt;[[#Reference-Robbins_Tet|Robbins (1940)]] 'Translator's Introduction' [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Ptolemy/Tetrabiblos/Introduction*.html II, p.x–xi].&lt;/ref&gt; Frank Eggleston Robbins, editor of the [[Loeb]] English translation published in 1940, considered it likely that this was the title used by Ptolemy himself, although he acknowledged that many other Greek manuscripts use the title {{lang|grc|Τὰ πρὸς Σύρον ἀποτελεσματικά}}, 'The prognostics addressed to Syrus'.&lt;ref name="R1" /&gt; An ancient anonymous commentary on the work states that some considered the term ''Tetrabiblos'' to be a fictitious name.&lt;ref name="R1" /&gt;

Hübner, editor of the 1998 Teubner Greek edition, uses the title ''Apotelesmatiká'' (''biblía''), '(books on) effects', which has been followed by recent scholars.&lt;ref name="H1"&gt;Heilen, Stephan, 'Ptolemy's Doctrine of the Terms and its Reception', in [[#Reference-Jones-2010|Jones (2010)]] [https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=Y61qolT7m98C&amp;lpg=PA82&amp;dq=Jones%2C%20Alexander%20(ed.)%202010.%20Ptolemy%20in%20Perspective%3A%20Use%20and%20Criticism%20of%20his%20Work%20from%20Antiquity%20to%20the%20Nineteenth%20Century&amp;pg=PA45#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false p.45].&lt;/ref&gt; Alexander Jones, editor of the Springer publication ''Ptolemy in Perspective'' (2010) considers that Ptolemy's own title remains unknown, but agrees that the term  ''Apotelesmatika''  is "a credible guess".&lt;ref name="J1" /&gt; This term is variously translated to mean 'influences',&lt;ref name="J1" /&gt; 'effects'&lt;ref name="H1" /&gt; or 'prognostics';&lt;ref name="R1" /&gt; reflecting the theme of work, which is concerned with gaining foreknowledge of the effects of predictable astronomical cycles.

There is no firmly established date for the compilation of the ''Tetrabiblos''  but Ptolemy discloses in his 'Introductory Address' that he wrote his astrological treatise after completing his astronomical one: the ''[[Almagest]]''.&lt;ref name="IA"&gt;[[#Reference-Robbins_Tet|''Tetrabiblos'']] I.1 (Loeb:  [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Ptolemy/Tetrabiblos/1A*.html#1 p.3]).&lt;/ref&gt;   Evidence within the ''Almagest'' reveals that the astronomical work could not have been completed before about 145 AD,&lt;ref&gt;N. T. Hamilton and N. M. Swerdlow, 'From Ancient Omens to Statistical Mechanics', in [[#Reference-BG|Berggren and Goldstein (1987)]], argue 150 A.D. (p.3–13); [[#Reference-Grasshoff|Grasshoff (1990)]] argues that the observations in the ''Almagest'' cover the period between 127–141 A.D. (p.7).&lt;/ref&gt;  which demonstrates that Ptolemy wrote the ''Tetrabiblos'' towards the end of his life, sometime between completing the ''Almagest'' and his death, generally reported to be around 168 A.D.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Reference-Pecker|Pecker (2001)]] [https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=zGOVnMa-LSIC&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;dq=Pecker%2C%20Jean%20Claude%2C%202001.%20Understanding%20the%20Heavens%3A%20Thirty%20Centuries%20of%20Astronomical%20Ideas%20from%20Ancient%20Thinking%20to%20Modern%20Cosmology.&amp;pg=PA311#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false p.311]. Most contemporary sources give c. 90 – c. 168 as the most likely time-span of Ptolemy's life. [[#Reference-Robbins_Tet|Robbins]] gives 100–178 ('Introduction', [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Ptolemy/Tetrabiblos/Introduction*.html I p.viii]). [[#Reference-Smith-1996|Mark Smith]] also veers towards the figures given by Robbins: "It is said that he lived to be seventy-eight and survived into the reign of Antonius Pius' successor, Mark Aurelius (161–180). These two claims, if true, would lead us to place Ptolemy's death not only somewhere within that span, but probably toward the end".&lt;/ref&gt;

The text begins with Ptolemy's address to "Syrus", an unidentified character to whom all Ptolemy's works are dedicated.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Reference-Ashmand|Ashmand (1822)]] 'Preface' [https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=hmCA5zjTr_cC&amp;lpg=PR23&amp;dq=Ptolemy%20syrus&amp;pg=PR24#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false  p.xxiv, footnote 4].&lt;/ref&gt;   In this Ptolemy differentiates between two types of astronomical study: the first ([[astronomy]] proper) which discovers the astronomical cycles and movements; the second ([[astrology]]) which investigates the changes these movements bring about. He states that each has its own science and  the former is desirable in its own right "even though it does not attain the result given by its combination with the second".&lt;ref name="IA" /&gt; This is taken to demonstrate Ptolemy's view that astronomy and astrology are complementary studies, so that whilst astrology is less self-sufficient and factual,&lt;ref name="tester57" /&gt; its employment makes the practice of astronomy more useful.&lt;ref name="Lx1"&gt;[[#Reference-Lehoux|Lehoux (2006)]] footnote 28: "Older versions of the history of astronomy tended to make great hay of Ptolemy's separating his astronomy and astrology into two books (the ''Almagest'' and the ''Tetrabiblos''), as though that pointed to doubts Ptolemy had about astrology as a body of knowledge. But Ptolemy is clear that even if it is ''less certain'', astrology is ''more useful'' than astronomy".&lt;/ref&gt; Although the terms ''astronomia'' and ''astrologia'' were used interchangeably in ancient texts,&lt;ref&gt;[[#Reference-Evans-Berggren-2006|Evans and Berggren (2006)]]  [https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=HPBE3RbeceQC&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;dq=Geminos&amp;pg=PA128#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false p.127])&lt;/ref&gt; this also demonstrates the early definition of two differentiated subjects which were discussed at length by Ptolemy in two separate works.&lt;ref name="Lx1" /&gt;

Ptolemy states that having dealt with the former subject (astronomy) in its own treatise, he "shall now give an account of the second and less self-sufficient method in a properly philosophical way, so that one whose aim is the truth might never compare its perceptions with the sureness of the first".&lt;ref name="IA" /&gt; In this, and further introductory remarks, he reveals his view that  astrological prediction is extremely difficult and easily subject to error, but satisfactorily attainable to those who possess the necessary skill and experience, and of too much benefit to be dismissed simply because it can sometimes be mistaken.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Reference-Robbins_Tet|''Tetrabiblos'']] I.2 (Loeb: [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Ptolemy/Tetrabiblos/1A*.html#2 p.19]): "...it would not be fitting to dismiss all prognostication of this character because it can sometimes be mistaken, for we do not discredit the art of the pilot for its many errors; but as when the claims are great, so also when they are divine, we should welcome what is possible and think it enough".&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Ptolemy's philosophical arguments ====
Chapters 2 and 3 are important for giving Ptolemy's philosophical defense of his subject. [[Franz Boll (philologist)|Franz Boll]] noticed the arguments were paralleled in older sources, particularly  those of the [[Stoicism|Stoic]] philosopher [[Posidonius]] ({{circa}}135 BCE–{{circa}}AD 51 BCE).&lt;ref&gt;[[#Reference-North|North (1989)]] p.248. Discussed by Boll in ''Studien uber Claudius Ptolemaus'' (Leipzig, 1894) pp.131ff.&lt;/ref&gt; Equally, Ptolemy's narrative was drawn  upon by later [[philosophers]] and [[astronomers]], such as [[Johannes Kepler]] who used similar examples and the same order of arguments to explain the  physical foundation of some astrological claims.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Reference-Jensen|Jensen (2006)]] p.118. Ptolemy's arguments were used by Kepler in his 1602 text, ''De Fundamentalis Astrologiae''.&lt;/ref&gt;   Described as  "scientifically speaking, perfectly laudable" by one modern commentator,&lt;ref&gt;[[#Reference-North|North (1989)]] p.248&lt;/ref&gt; another has condemned these chapters  as the place where Ptolemy's "knowledge, intelligence and rhetorical skill" are most "misused".&lt;ref&gt;[[#Reference-Long|Long (1982)]] p.178.&lt;/ref&gt;

In chapter one Ptolemy asserts the legitimacy of the study and identifies the two main arguments set against it: 
# the complexity of the subject makes its claim of providing reliable foreknowledge unattainable;
# reliable foreknowledge—if it can be attained—would imply such [[fatalism]] as to make the subject's purpose useless (since if the future is predictable, anything which is destined to happen will happen whether predicted or not).
Ptolemy then answers each criticism in the following two chapters.

;Argument on the extent of astrology's reliability
In chapter two Ptolemy maintains that knowledge gained by astronomical means is attainable and he attempts to define its limits according to "Aristotelian-Stoic" logic.&lt;ref name="tester64"&gt;[[#Reference-Tester-1987|Tester (1987)]]  [https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=L0HSvH96alIC&amp;pg=PA64#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false p.64].&lt;/ref&gt;  He points out how the [[Sun]] has the greatest influence upon the Earth’s seasonal and daily cycles, and that most things in nature are synchronised by the [[Moon]]:
{{quote|... as the heavenly body nearest the Earth, the Moon bestows her effluence  most abundantly upon mundane things, for most of them, animate or inanimate, are sympathetic to her and change in company with her; the rivers increase and diminish their streams with her light, the seas turn their own tides with her rising and setting, and plants and animals in whole or in some part wax and wane with her.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Reference-Robbins_Tet|''Tetrabiblos'']] I.2 (Loeb: [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Ptolemy/Tetrabiblos/1A*.html#1 p.7]).&lt;/ref&gt;}}
He extends this ability to stir the weather and steer the biological patterns of earthly creatures to  the [[stars in astrology|fixed stars]] and [[Classical planet|planets]], so that everything which experiences cycles of growth, or patterns of behaviour, is in some way responsive to the celestial cycles. These bring about elemental changes (hot, windy, snowy or watery conditions, ''etc''): led by the Sun, activated by the Moon and aided by the planetary [[astrological aspect|configurations]] and the fixed stars' [[phenomena]]. The prevailing [[meteorological]] qualities are then considered to   determine the [[temperament]] – the quality of the moment of time at a specific place - which is  presumed to be impressed, as a sort of temporal imprint, upon the seed of anything which comes into germination or manifestation at that moment in time. Ptolemy admits that successful analysis of this temperament is not easily attained but is capable of being determined by someone who is able to regard the data “both scientifically and by successful conjecture”. He questions why, if a person can reliably predict the general weather patterns and their effects upon agricultural seeds and animals from the knowledge of the celestial cycles: 
{{quote|... can he not, too, with respect to an individual man, perceive the general quality of his temperament from the ambient&lt;ref&gt;The term "ambient" refers to the humoural state of the surrounding air; ''i.e.,'' the 'enveloping environment' (''Ambient'': "relating to the immediate surroundings of something" [http://oxforddictionaries.com/definition/ambient Oxford English Dictionary]. Retrieved 4 September 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; at the time of his birth, … and predict occasional events, by the fact that such and such an ambient is attuned to such and such a temperament and is favourable to prosperity, while another is not so attuned and conduces to injury?&lt;ref&gt;[[#Reference-Robbins_Tet|''Tetrabiblos'']] I.2 (Loeb: [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Ptolemy/Tetrabiblos/1A*.html#1 p.13]).&lt;/ref&gt;}}
Whilst suggesting that such arguments are enough to demonstrate the validity of astrology, Ptolemy accepts that many mistakes are made in its practice - partly because of  "evident rascals" who profess to practice it without due knowledge and pretend to foretell things which cannot be naturally known (sometimes using the term 'astrology' for practices which are not true to the genuine study of astrology)&lt;ref&gt;[[#Reference-Robbins_Tet|''Tetrabiblos'']] I.2 (Loeb: [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Ptolemy/Tetrabiblos/1A*.html#1 p.13]), ''i.e''., those who "for the sake of gain, claim credence for another art under the name of this, and deceive the vulgar". In his commentary on the ''Tetrabiblos'' [[Jerome Cardan]] gave the example of those who give elaborate predictions based only on the day or month of birth.&lt;/ref&gt; and because legitimate practitioners must acquire a magnitude of knowledge and experience within a limited life-span. His summary is that the study is usually only able to give reliable knowledge in general terms; that astrological advice should be welcomed but not expected to be faultless; and that the astrologer should not be criticised but encouraged to integrate non-celestial information within the compilation of a judgement (such as what is known of an individual’s ethnic background, nationality and parental influences).&lt;ref&gt;[[#Reference-Robbins_Tet|''Tetrabiblos'']] I.2 (Loeb: [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Ptolemy/Tetrabiblos/1A*.html#1 p.19]): "We should not object to astrologers using as a basis for calculation nationality, country, and rearing, or any other existing accidental qualities". Most of book II is given to exploring the stereotypes of nations in astrological terms.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

;Argument on whether astrology is natural and useful

In chapter three Ptolemy argues that astrological prediction is both natural and beneficial. The translation of these ideas into Latin in the 12th century are described as being "of critical importance" to the adoption of a favourable attitude towards astrology within [[Christianity]] in the [[Medieval period]].&lt;ref&gt;[[#Reference-Lindberg|Lindberg (2007)]] [https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=dPUBAkIm2lUC&amp;lpg=PA274&amp;dq=Tetrabiblos%20ending&amp;pg=PA274#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false p.247ff].&lt;/ref&gt;
  
Ptolemy first proposes that it is not "useless" to create predictions of what is likely to happen, even if the predictions do not provide the means to avoid impending disaster. This was one of the well known classical criticisms that had been brought to prominence in [[Cicero]]'s text ''[[De Divinatione]]'', in the argument that no good comes from warnings of imminent disasters when they  offer no means of escape.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Reference-Cicero|Cicero (c. 45 BC)]] [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Cicero/de_Divinatione/2*.html II.25,54, p.433]: "why do they warn us of things which we cannot avoid? Why, even a mortal, if he has a proper sense of duty, does not warn his friends of imminent disasters which can in no way be escaped".&lt;/ref&gt; Ptolemy gives a more positive view of divination in his assessment of astrology as a subject "by which we gain full view of things human and divine",&lt;ref name="T21"&gt;[[#Reference-Robbins_Tet|''Tetrabiblos'']] I.3 (Loeb: [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Ptolemy/Tetrabiblos/1A*.html#1 pp.21–23]).&lt;/ref&gt; which, he argues, gives a better perception of "what is fitting and expedient for the capabilities of each temperament".&lt;ref name="T21" /&gt; He views astrology as a subject which encourages enhanced self-knowledge, to be valued as a source of pleasure and well-being; since even if astrology cannot aid in the acquisition of riches or fame; the same can be said of all philosophy, which concerns itself with "greater advantages". Hence, in the case of unfortunate events that will necessarily take place, Ptolemy asserts that astrological prediction still brings benefits, because "foreknowledge accustoms and calms the soul by experience of distant events as though they were present, and prepares it to greet with calm and steadiness whatever comes".&lt;ref name="T21" /&gt;

Ptolemy's next argument was to avoid the criticisms that arise when the practice of prediction is seen to suggest [[fatalism|fatal necessity]].  This point was crucial to later theological acceptance, since [[Medieval]] religious doctrine dictates that the individual [[soul]] must possess [[free will]], in order to be responsible for its own choices and the consequences that flow from them. Gerard of Feltre's 13th-century text ''Summa on the Stars'' demonstrates the problem that astrological determinism creates for the theological argument: "If the stars make a man a murderer or a thief, then all the more it is the first cause, God, who does this, which it is shameful to suggest".&lt;ref&gt;[[#Reference- kieck|Kieckhefer (2000)]] [https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=Iw6ipCq-pZsC&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;dq=Richard%20Kieckhefer%2C%20Magic%20in%20the%20Middle%20Ages%20(Cambridge%3A%20Cambridge%20University%20Press%2C%202000&amp;pg=PA128#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false p.128].&lt;/ref&gt;  Ptolemy's comments counter the criticism by proposing that whilst the celestial cycles are entirely reliable and "eternally performed in accordance with divine, unchangeable destiny",&lt;ref name="T21" /&gt;  all earthly things are also subject to "a natural and mutable fate, and in drawing its first causes from above it is governed by chance and natural sequence".&lt;ref name="T21" /&gt;  He therefore declares that nothing is irrevocably ordained, and we are not to imagine that "events attend mankind as the result of the heavenly cause as if … destined to take place by necessity without the possibility of any other cause whatever interfering".&lt;ref name="T21" /&gt;

In this discussion Ptolemy makes a point that was to be called upon by many later astrological writers, that "the lesser cause always yields to the stronger".&lt;ref name="T25"&gt;[[#Reference-Robbins_Tet|''Tetrabiblos'']] I.3 (Loeb: [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Ptolemy/Tetrabiblos/1A*.html#1 pp.25–29]).&lt;/ref&gt;  He sees an individual as unable to resist the greater cycles of change which happen to the wider community, so even a man whose horoscope indicates gain may perish at a time that his community is struck by natural disaster or pestilence. However, Ptolemy also maintains that disastrous events will only follow a natural course if no counter action is taken to avert the problem, as when "future happenings to men are not known, or if they are known and the remedies are not applied".&lt;ref name="T25" /&gt;  He takes a balanced position in the argument of fate versus free will in writing that certain things, because their effective causes are numerous, become inevitable, whilst others are able to be averted by the act of astrological prediction. The astrologer's position is compared to that of the physician, who must be able to recognise beforehand which ailments are always fatal, and which admit of aid.&lt;ref name="T25" /&gt;

It is therefore reasonable, in Ptolemy's estimation, to moderate actions with awareness of how the prevailing and future temperament prospers or injures the natal temperament, or to elect to act at a time that is astrologically suitable to the activity – just as it is deemed rational to use knowledge of the stars to ensure safety at sea; to use knowledge of the lunar cycle to ensure successful breeding and sowing, or to cool ourselves against the extremes of temperature in order that we suffer less.

Ptolemy's philosophical conclusion on the subject, which helped to secure its intellectual standing until the 18th century, is thus: "even if it be not entirely infallible, at least its possibilities have appeared worthy of the highest regard".&lt;ref name="T25" /&gt; Having justified his intellectual involvement in the study, according to the philosophical principles of his day, Ptolemy then turns his attention to the practical theory of astrology, and the rationale that lies behind the arrangement of its principles.

=== Introduction of principles ===
[[File:Bartolomeu Velho 1568.jpg|thumb|right|300px|'''Figure of the heavenly bodies''' — An illustration of the [[Geocentric model#Ptolemaic system|Ptolemaic geocentric system]] by Portuguese cosmographer and cartographer [[Bartolomeu Velho]], 1568 (Bibliothèque Nationale, Paris).]]
One of the unique features of the ''Tetrabiblos'', amongst the astrological texts of its period, is the extent to which the first book not only introduces the basic astrological principles, but synthesises and explains the reasoning behind their reported associations in line with [[Aristotelianism|Aristotelian philosophy]].&lt;ref name="riley255"&gt;[[#Reference-Riley|Riley (1974)]] p.255.&lt;/ref&gt; Chapter four, for example, explains the "power of the planets" through their associations with the creative humoral qualities of warmth or moisture, or the reductive qualities of cold and dryness.&lt;ref name="tester59"&gt;[[#Reference-Tester-1987|Tester (1987)]]  [https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=L0HSvH96alIC&amp;lpg=PA57&amp;dq=Tester%20Ptolemy&amp;pg=PA59#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false p.59].&lt;/ref&gt; Hence Mars is described as a destructive planet because its humoral association is excessive dryness, whilst Jupiter is defined as temperate and fertilising because its association is moderate warmth and humidity.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Reference-Robbins_Tet|''Tetrabiblos'']] I.4  (Loeb: [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Ptolemy/Tetrabiblos/1B*.html#4 p.37]). See also [[#Reference-Riley88|Riley (1988)]]  p.69.&lt;/ref&gt;  These associations are based on the arrangements of the planets with regard to the Sun, as perceived from the  [[Geocentric model|geocentric perspective]], by which their orbits are measured is if they are centred upon the Earth.

Uniting these Aristotelian principles with a prevalent Greek philosophy employed by [[Zeno of Citium]] and the [[Pythagoreanism|Pythagorean]]s, the next three chapters arrange the planets into pairs of opposites.&lt;ref name="tester59" /&gt;   They may be [[Benefic planet|benefic]] (moderately warming or moistening) or [[Malefic planet|malefic]] (excessively cooling or drying); masculine (drying) or feminine (moistening); active and [[astrology of sect|diurnal]] (suited to the qualities of the day and aligned with the nature of the Sun) or passive and [[astrology of sect|nocturnal]]  (suited to the qualities of the night and aligned with the nature of the Moon).&lt;ref&gt;[[#Reference-Robbins_Tet|''Tetrabiblos'']] I.5–7 (Loeb:  [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Ptolemy/Tetrabiblos/1B*.html#4 pp.39–43]).&lt;/ref&gt;  Since these humoral associations derive from configurations with the Sun, chapter eight describes how they are subtly modified according to the  phase of each planet’s [[synodic cycle]] with the Sun.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Reference-Robbins_Tet|''Tetrabiblos'']] I.8 (Loeb:  [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Ptolemy/Tetrabiblos/1B*.html#4 p.45]). The first quarter of the synodic cycle brings an added emphasis on moisture; the next increases warmth; the next (in which the cycle is receding) withdraws the moisture and brings an added emphasis on dryness, and the final quarter (which closes the cycle) withdraws warmth and brings an added emphasis on coldness.&lt;/ref&gt;

Chapter nine discusses the "power of the fixed stars". Here, rather than give direct humoral associations, Ptolemy describes their "temperatures" as being like that of the planets he has already defined. Hence [[Aldebaran]] ("called the Torch") is described as having "a temperature like that of Mars", whilst other stars in the [[Hyades (star cluster)|Hyades]] are "like that of Saturn and moderately like that of Mercury".&lt;ref&gt;[[#Reference-Robbins_Tet|''Tetrabiblos'']] I.9 (Loeb: [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Ptolemy/Tetrabiblos/1B*.html#4 p.47]).&lt;/ref&gt; At the end of the chapter Ptolemy clarifies that these are not his proposals, but are drawn from   historical sources, being "the observations of the effects of the stars themselves as made by our predecessors".&lt;ref&gt;[[#Reference-Robbins_Tet|''Tetrabiblos'']] I.9 (Loeb: [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Ptolemy/Tetrabiblos/1B*.html#4 p.59]).&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Ptolemy Muller.jpg|thumb|left|'''Ptolemy instructing [[Regiomontanus]]''' under an image of the zodiac encircling the [[celestial spheres]]. Frontispiece from Ptolemy's ''Almagest'', (Venice, 1496).]]

Chapter ten returns to the humoral theme more explicitly, clarifying that the [[zodiac]] is aligned to the [[season]]s and so expressive of the shifting emphasis through moisture, warmth, dryness and cold, (as brought about by [[Spring (season)|spring]], [[summer]], [[autumn]], and [[winter]]). Similarly,  the four [[Angle (astrology)|angles of the chart]] present an humoral emphasis through association with the effects of the four cardinal [[winds]] that blow from their aligned directions.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Reference-Robbins_Tet|''Tetrabiblos'']] I.10 (Loeb: [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Ptolemy/Tetrabiblos/1B*.html#4 pp.59–65]). The [[Ascendant]] is the eastern angle, associated with the east wind ([[Apeliotes]]) which excels in dryness; the [[midheaven]] is the southern angle, associated with the south wind ([[Anemoi#Notus|Notus]]) which excels in heat; the [[Descendant (astrology)|descendant]] is the western angle, associated with the west wind ([[Anemoi#Zephyrus|Zephyrus]]) which excels in moisture; and the [[Imum Coeli]] is the northern angle, associated with the north wind ([[Anemoi#Boreas|Boreas]]) which excels in cold.&lt;/ref&gt; The remainder of book one (up to the final two chapters which concern the [[planetary phase]]s and aspectual applications), presents the rulerships, divisions, and configurations of the [[astrological signs|zodiac signs]], most of which are related to astronomical definitions, seasonal effects, physics and [[History of geometry|geometry]]. Geometrical principles are used to define the favourable or unfavourable quality of [[astrological aspect]]s, based on the angular relationship of planets and signs with [[ecliptic]] degrees.&lt;ref name="Riley" /&gt;

In Ptolemy’s era the boundaries of the zodiac signs were close to those of the visible [[constellation]]s whose names they bear, but Ptolemy demonstrates the theoretical distinction between the two frames of reference in describing the starting point of the zodiac as fixed, not to the stars, but to the mathematically calculated [[vernal equinox]].&lt;ref&gt;It is sometimes suggested that Ptolemy invented the tropical zodiac or broke conventional practice in his use of it; see for example Heilen, 'Ptolemy's Doctrine of the Terms and its Reception', [https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=Y61qolT7m98C&amp;lpg=PA52&amp;dq=Ptolemy%20Zodiac&amp;pg=PA52#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false p.52], in [[#Reference-Jones-2010|Jones (2010)]],  or  Robert and Dann,''The Astrological Revolution'', (Steiner Books, 2010) [https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=kxpQ1ARAS3QC&amp;lpg=PT280&amp;dq=Ptolemy%20Zodiac&amp;pg=PT280#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false p.234]. However, it is clear that Ptolemy was merely following convention, as demonstrated by ''Geminos's Introduction to the phenomena'', 'On the Circle of the Signs' [https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=HPBE3RbeceQC&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;dq=Geminos&amp;pg=PA113#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false ch.1], where the tropical zodiac is given detailed explanation in a text dated to the 1st century BCE, and known to be based on the accounts of older authorities ([[#Reference-Evans-Berggren-2006|Evans and Berggren (2006)]], Preface, p.xvi and Introduction, [https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=HPBE3RbeceQC&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;dq=Geminos&amp;pg=PA2#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false p.2]); and also because Ptolemy states that he is offering the methods of his older sources: "it is reasonable to reckon the beginnings of the signs also from the equinoxes and solstices, partly because the writers make this quite clear, and particularly because from our previous demonstrations we observe that their natures, powers, and familiarities take their cause from the solstitial and equinoctial starting-places, and from no other source. For if other starting-places are assumed, we shall either be compelled no longer to use the natures of the signs for prognostications or, if we use them, to be in error" (I.22, Loeb: [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Ptolemy/Tetrabiblos/1B*.html#4 p.109–111]).&lt;/ref&gt;  This determines the seasonally based [[tropical zodiac]] which takes its name from the Greek word τροπικός ''tropikos'': ‘of the turning’,&lt;ref&gt;Henry George Liddell, Robert Scott, ''A Greek-English Lexicon'': [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0057%3Aentry%3Dtroph%2F A: 'τροπ-ή , ἡ, (τρέπω)] ('turn, turning'); 1.b "each of two fixed points in the solar year, ''the solstices''". Retrieved 24 November 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;  because it is set by the turn of the seasons and, being subject to [[Axial precession (astronomy)|precession]], experiences a slow and gradual revolution through the visible constellations.&lt;ref&gt;Although the rate of revolution is only 1° every 72 years, it adds up over long periods of time. Nearly 2,000 years have passed since Ptolemy wrote his ''Tetrabiblos'' so the displacement is now approximating to the distance of a whole zodiac sign. The full cycle completes over the course of 26,000 years  - see [[#Reference-Evans|Evans (1998)]] [https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=OX4qMyHyizYC&amp;lpg=PA1&amp;pg=PT405#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false p.245ff].&lt;/ref&gt;  For the same reason, the signs that mark the Sun’s summer and winter [[solstice]] points ([[Cancer (astrology)|Cancer]] and [[Capricorn (astrology)|Capricorn]]) are described as the 'tropical signs',&lt;ref&gt;Ptolemy described only Cancer and Capricorn as 'tropical' and referred to Aries and Libra (the signs of spring and autumn) as the equinoctial signs. Generally, other ancient authors referred to all four as tropical, to distinguish them from the 'solid' signs (Taurus, Leo, Scorpio and Aquarius) which indicate established seasons, and the 'bi-corporeal' signs (Gemini, Virgo, Sagittarius and Pisces), which Ptolemy says are so called because "they share, as it were, at end and beginning, the natural properties of the two states of weather" (I.11, Loeb: [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Ptolemy/Tetrabiblos/1B*.html#4 p.69]).&lt;/ref&gt; since these are the places where the Sun 'turns' its direction in [[celestial latitude]], (thereby defining the terrestrial [[circles of latitude]] known as the [[Tropic of Cancer]] and the [[Tropic of Capricorn]]).&lt;ref&gt;[[#Reference-Robbins_Tet|''Tetrabiblos'']] I.11 (Loeb: [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Ptolemy/Tetrabiblos/1B*.html#4 p.67]): "They have received their name from what takes place in them. For the Sun turns when he is at the beginning of these signs and reverses his latitudinal progress, causing summer in Cancer and winter in Capricorn".&lt;/ref&gt;

Whereas other ancient astrological writers gave their emphasis to the astrological interpretation of such definitions (for example, in describing how tropical signs are indicative of quickly changing situations),&lt;ref&gt;By comparison, [[Vettius Valens]] mentions the fact that Cancer is a tropical sign as one of 14 descriptive terms for the sign, and sets out the character traits of those "so born", which includes reference to Cancerians being "changeable" (''Anthology'', I.2).&lt;/ref&gt; Ptolemy's focus is notably different; given to the astronomical and philosophical factors that underlie the definitions rather than their astrological meaning in practice. Ptolemy explains that the definitions of the zodiac are not his own, but present "the natural characters of the zodiacal signs, as they have been handed down by tradition".&lt;ref&gt;[[#Reference-Robbins_Tet|''Tetrabiblos'']] I.11 (Loeb: [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Ptolemy/Tetrabiblos/1B*.html#4 p.65]).&lt;/ref&gt;  His approach finds elegant expression where he is demonstrating the logic of schematic arrangements (such as the philosophical principles behind the [[Domicile (astrology)|planetary rulership of signs]]),&lt;ref&gt;[[#Reference-Robbins_Tet|''Tetrabiblos'']] I.17 (Loeb: [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Ptolemy/Tetrabiblos/1B*.html#4 p.79]).&lt;/ref&gt;  but is noted to convey detachment in regard to the elements of astrology that are not so obviously plausible.&lt;ref&gt;For which reason he notes, but dismisses as illogical, the use of dodecatemoria (the 12-fold division of each zodiac-sign into segments of {{frac|2|1|2}}°). His argument is that such manufactured numerical divisions have no basis in the natural astronomical cycles.&lt;/ref&gt; This can be seen in the way that Ptolemy avoids going into detail on the facets of astrology that rely on [[mythological]], or [[symbol]]ic associations, and how he is willing to outline the reasoning behind  conflicting astrological proposals without revealing any personal preference for one scheme over another.&lt;ref&gt;For example, where he explains the three different ways by which the signs can be classified as masculine or feminine (I.12, [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Ptolemy/Tetrabiblos/1B*.html#4 pp.69–73]).&lt;/ref&gt;

Some commentators have viewed Ptolemy's comparatively dispassionate approach towards points of astrological contention as reason to suppose he was more interested in the theoretical principles than the actual practice of astrology.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Reference-Riley|Riley (1974)]] p.247: "Quite different approaches were used by the other astrological writers, who are concerned with practical matters. Dorotheus begins, not with a proof of the validity of astrology or a description of the universe, but with instructions for calculating births, the native's status, the native's parents status, his brothers, and so on".&lt;/ref&gt;  On the other hand, the objective tone that marks his style; his assertion that the subject is natural (by which he makes no demand for oaths of secrecy from its students as some contemporaries do);&lt;ref&gt;The 4th-century astrologer [[Julius Firmicus Maternus]] describes in his ''Mathesis'' (7.I.I) how oaths of silence were required by [[Orpheus]], [[Pythagoras]], [[Plato]] and [[Porphyry (philosopher)|Porphyry]]. Vettius Valens declared that his teachings should not be imparted to the ignorant or through chance encounters (''Anthology'' 293.26–29) and relates how [[Critodemus]] extracted "frightful oaths" from his students (150.16).&lt;/ref&gt; and the way he shows respectful reference to alternative views without vilifying authors whose practices might differ from his own,&lt;ref&gt;[[#Reference-Riley|Riley (1974)]] p.250: "Ptolemy, for whatever reason, shows few signs of the animosity toward fellow professionals which is so evident in ancient literary society".&lt;/ref&gt;  all helped to secure the text’s historical reputation as an intellectually superior one. [[Classics]] scholar Mark Riley raised these points in his assessment that Ptolemy approached the subject of astrology with exactly the same theoretical inclination that he applied to astronomy, [[Geography (Ptolemy)|geography]] and the other sciences on which he wrote.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Reference-Riley|Riley (1974)]] p.236.&lt;/ref&gt; This distinctive style of approach led Riley to conclude: "The respect shown to Ptolemy’s work by all later astrologers was due, not to its usefulness to the practitioner, but to his magisterial synthesis of astrology and science".&lt;ref name="riley255" /&gt;

== Book II: Mundane astrology ==
Book II presents Ptolemy's treatise on [[mundane astrology]]. This offers a comprehensive review of  [[ethnic stereotypes]], [[eclipses]], significations of [[comets]] and seasonal [[Lunar phase|lunations]], as used in the prediction of national economics, wars, epidemics, natural disasters and weather patterns. No other surviving ancient text offers a comparable account of this topic, in terms of the breadth and depth of detail offered by Ptolemy.  Although no demonstrated examples are given, he writes with authority in this branch of his subject, which suggests it was of particular interest to him. Modern commentators have remarked that Ptolemy was "consciously taking a different approach" to contrast "with the 'old', infinitely complicated methods".&lt;ref name="Riley" /&gt;

Ptolemy begins by stating he has briefly reviewed the important principles and will now develop the details of astrology in the appropriate order. His point is that astrological assessment of any 'particular' individual must rest upon prior knowledge of the 'general' temperament of their ethnic type; and that the circumstances of individual lives are subsumed, to some extent, within the fate of their community.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Reference-Robbins_Tet|''Tetrabiblos'']] II,1 (Loeb: [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Ptolemy/Tetrabiblos/2A*.html#1 p.119]): "And since weaker natures always yield to the stronger, and the particular always falls under the general, it would by all means be necessary for those who purpose an inquiry about a single individual long before to have comprehended the more general considerations".&lt;/ref&gt;

The second chapter gives a broad generalisation of how genetic differences develop between the inhabitants of the various [[climes]] (a demarcation based on latitude).  Communities that live close to the equator, for example, are described as having black skins, small statures, and thick woolly hair, as a protective response to the burning heat of that location. By contrast, communities that have settled in high northern regions are defined by their colder environment and its greater share of moisture. Their bodily forms are  paler, taller, with finer hair, and in their characteristics they are described as "somewhat cold in nature".&lt;ref name="TII2"&gt;[[#Reference-Robbins_Tet|''Tetrabiblos'']] II.2 (Loeb: [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Ptolemy/Tetrabiblos/2A*.html#1 p.123, 127]).&lt;/ref&gt; Both types are described as lacking civilisation because of the extremes of their environment, whereas communities that live in temperate regions are medium in colouring, moderate in stature and enjoy a more equable lifestyle. The several regions are similarly defined according to the mix that arises within this kind of analysis. Ptolemy explains that such considerations are only dealt with summarily, as a background consideration for what follows. He also makes clear that such traits are to be found "generally present, but not in every individual".&lt;ref name="TII2" /&gt;

[[File:Claudius Ptolemy- The World.jpg|thumb|300px|15th-century map depicting Ptolemy's description of the inhabited world, (1482, Johannes Schnitzer).]]

In chapter 3 Ptolemy unites his interests in astrology and geography, to outline the astrological associations of "our inhabited world". Maps based on Ptolemy’s ''[[Geography (Ptolemy)|Geographica]]'' show Ptolemy’s definition of the inhabited world as (roughly) extending from the equator to latitude 66°N, covering the land mass between the Atlantic Ocean and East China Sea.&lt;ref&gt;A footnote in the Robbins edition offers [[Jerome Cardan]]’s explanation that Ptolemy’s "inhabited world" was conceived "as a trapezium, narrower at the top (north) than the bottom, and bounded by arcs; this is divided into quadrants by north-south and east-west lines. The 'parts closer to the centre' are then marked off by lines joining the ends of the two latter, dividing each quadrant and producing 4 right-angled triangles at the centre". [[#Reference-Robbins_Tet|Robbins (1940)]] [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Ptolemy/Tetrabiblos/2A*.html#note8 p.129, n. 2]).&lt;/ref&gt;  Ptolemy extends the logic given in ancient Babylonian texts where the four quarters of the known world are attributed to the four [[triplicity]] arrangements of the zodiac.&lt;ref&gt;The triplicity groups connect the signs that stand 120° apart, and so create the shape of a triangle when joined by lines from degree to degree within the  360° circle of the zodiac. These groups are later known as the fire, earth, air and water signs, but Ptolemy does not refer to them this way.&lt;/ref&gt;  The attribution is based on association between the planets that govern the triplicities and the directions and winds those planets are affiliated with. For example, the 'Aries triplicity' (which includes Aries, Leo and Sagittarius) is chiefly dominated by Jupiter and assisted by Mars. Jupiter rules the north wind and Mars the west wind; therefore this triplicity governs the north-west quarter of Ptolemy’s "inhabited world": the area known as Europe.&lt;ref&gt;The north-eastern quarter (Scythia) is given to the triplicity of Gemini (including Libra and Aquarius); the south-eastern (Greater [[Asia]]) to the triplicity of Taurus (inc. Virgo and Capricorn); and the south-western ([[Ancient Libya]], which corresponds to [[Northwest Africa]]),  to the triplicity of Cancer (including Scorpio and Pisces).&lt;/ref&gt;

Again, these divisions are general, and specific rulership of each nation is modified by location and observed cultural distinctions. For example, in Europe, only those regions that lie to the north-west extremes are fully attributed to Jupiter and Mars, since those that lie towards the centre of the inhabited area incline towards the influence of opposing regions.&lt;ref name="T131"&gt;[[#Reference-Robbins_Tet|''Tetrabiblos'']] II.3 (Loeb: [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Ptolemy/Tetrabiblos/2A*.html#1 pp.131–137]).&lt;/ref&gt;  In this way, the "inhabited region" experiences a drift of astrological correspondence rather than sharp divisions within its quarters, and independent nations are variously affiliated with the signs of each triplicity and the planets that rule them. Ptolemy names Britain and Spain as two nations appropriately placed in the north-west quarter to accept the rulership of Jupiter and Mars. Such nations are described as "independent, liberty-loving, fond of arms, industrious", based on characteristics attributed to those planets. Being predominantly governed by masculine planets they are also "without passion for women and look down upon the pleasures of love".&lt;ref name="T131" /&gt;  Observed characteristics influence his categorisation of Britain as having a closer affinity with Aries and Mars (by which "for the most part its inhabitants are fiercer, more headstrong and bestial"), whilst Spain is reported to be more subject to Sagittarius and Jupiter, (from which is evidenced "their independence, simplicity and love of cleanliness").&lt;ref name="T131" /&gt;

Though Ptolemy describes his analysis as a "brief exposition",&lt;ref name="T157"&gt;[[#Reference-Robbins_Tet|''Tetrabiblos'']] II.3 (Loeb: [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Ptolemy/Tetrabiblos/2A*.html#1 pp.157–161]).&lt;/ref&gt;  the chapter builds into an extensive association between planets, zodiac signs and the national characteristics of 73 nations. It concludes with three additional assertions which act as core principles of mundane astrology:
# Each of the fixed stars has familiarity with the countries attributed to the sign of its ecliptic rising.
# The time of the first founding of a city (or nation) can be used in a similar way to an individual [[horoscope]], to astrologically establish the characteristics and experiences of that city. The most significant considerations are the regions of the zodiac which mark the place of the Sun and Moon, and the [[Angle (astrology)|four angles of the chart]] – in particular the [[ascendant]].
# If the time of the foundation of the city or nation is not known, a similar use can be made of the horoscope of whoever holds office or is king at the time, with particular attention given to the [[midheaven]] of that chart.&lt;ref name="T157" /&gt;

=== Use of eclipses ===

The remainder of the book shows how this information is used in the prediction of mundane events. Focus is given to eclipses, as the "first and most potent" cause of change,&lt;ref&gt;[[#Reference-Robbins_Tet|''Tetrabiblos'']] II.4 (Loeb:  [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Ptolemy/Tetrabiblos/2A*.html#1 p.161]).&lt;/ref&gt;   supplemented by examination of the 'stations'  of the [[superior planets]]: Saturn, Jupiter and Mars.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Reference-Robbins_Tet|''Tetrabiblos'']] II.4 (Loeb: [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Ptolemy/Tetrabiblos/2A*.html#1 p.163]). The planetary stations are where each planet's motion, according to geocentric observation, appears to halt and change direction. This leads the planet into or out of a period of [[apparent retrograde motion]].&lt;/ref&gt;  Although eclipses are deemed relevant to any nation affiliated with the zodiac signs in which they occur, Ptolemy's scrutiny is reserved for regions where they are visible, which he argues will manifest the effects most noticeably.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Reference-Robbins_Tet|''Tetrabiblos'']] II.4 (Loeb: [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Ptolemy/Tetrabiblos/2A*.html#1 p.163]).  See also II.7 (Loeb:[http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Ptolemy/Tetrabiblos/2B*.html#7  p.177]), where the extent of obscuration helps to determine the proportion of those in the region who will feel its effect.&lt;/ref&gt;  The period of obscuration determines the endurance of the effect, with each hour proportioning to years for a solar eclipse and months for a lunar eclipse.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Reference-Robbins_Tet|''Tetrabiblos'']] II.6 (Loeb: [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Ptolemy/Tetrabiblos/2B*.html#6 p.167]).&lt;/ref&gt;  The location of the eclipse with relation to the horizon is then used to judge whether the effects are most prevalent at the beginning, middle or end of the period,  with times of  intensification identified by planetary contacts to the degree of the eclipse which occur within this period.&lt;ref&gt;Effects are assumed to be most effective at the beginning of the period if the eclipse is visible near to the [[ascendant]]; in the middle of the period if it is near to the [[midheaven]], and at the end of the period if it is near to the  [[Descendant (astrology)|descendant]]. Attention is given to significant planetary conjunctions which fall upon, or make aspects to, the zodiac position in which the eclipse occurred. In this, planets that are rising into view in new synodic cycles signify the intensification of effects, whereas planets which are at the end of their synodic phases and disappearing under the glare of the Sun’s light bring abatements (II. 6 Loeb: [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Ptolemy/Tetrabiblos/2B*.html#6 p.169]).&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Ptolemy Astrology 1564.jpg|thumb|left|Depiction of Ptolemy employing a quadrant, from Giordano Ziletti's ''Principles of astrology and geography according to Ptolemy'', 1564.]]
Chapter 7 begins the examination of what type of event will manifest. This is judged by the [[Angle (astrology)|angle of the horizon]] which precedes the eclipse in the chart set for the location under scrutiny&lt;ref&gt;The four ‘angles’ of the chart show where the ecliptic cuts the eastern horizon ([[ascendant]]), the upper meridian ([[midheaven]]), the western horizon ([[Descendant (astrology)|descendant]]) and the lower meridian ([[Immum Coeli]]). For an eclipse to be visible and therefore astrologically relevant, it must occur above the horizon, either preceding or succeeding the midheaven. If it falls between the ascendant and the midheaven, then the relevant preceding angle is the ascendant. If it falls between the midheaven and the descendant, then the relevant preceding angle is the midheaven.&lt;/ref&gt;   and the planet(s) that dominate this angle by rulership and powerful aspectual connections.&lt;ref&gt;A procedure is outlined to establish the most significant planet. Preference is given to the planet which holds dominance over the eclipse degree but if the planet that governs the preceding angle is also powerful, preference is given to whichever is closest to one of the angles of the chart. If it is impossible to distinguish between them, both are used as partners in the signification of effect.&lt;/ref&gt;  Whether the predicted effect is beneficial or destructive depends on the condition of these planets, whilst the type of manifestation is judged by the zodiac signs, fixed stars&lt;ref&gt;[[#Reference-Robbins_Tet|''Tetrabiblos'']] II.8 (Loeb: [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Ptolemy/Tetrabiblos/2B*.html#8 pp.177–179]). Particular attention is given to the star that rises on the ascendant or culminates on the midheaven, whichever of these is the relevant preceding angle. (II.7 Loeb: [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Ptolemy/Tetrabiblos/2B*.html#7 p.171]).&lt;/ref&gt; and constellations involved.&lt;ref&gt;As an example of how this might be applied, an eclipse dominated by the 'beneficial planet' Jupiter, in good condition, would suggest prosperity and good meteorological conditions, whereas a planet considered to be destructive, such as Saturn, would suggest scarcity, freezing weather and floods  (II.8 Loeb:[http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Ptolemy/Tetrabiblos/2B*.html#8 pp.181–183]). If the event involves the tropical signs of the zodiac, the effects could be related to politics, whereas fixed signs indicate foundations and constructions of buildings, whilst common signs indicate men and kings.  If the animal signs are involved, the effects relate to herds or oxen, but if the sign or constellation presents the form of water or fish, the influence connects to the sea, fleets and floods. Of the 'terrestrial' signs (those depicted by humans or animals that live on land), the [[Northern and southern signs|northern signs]] anticipate problems such as earthquakes that arise from the land, whilst the [[Northern and southern signs|southern signs]] bring unexpected rains (II.7 Loeb:[http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Ptolemy/Tetrabiblos/2B*.html#7 pp.171–175]).&lt;/ref&gt;  The resulting prediction is of relevance to nations, but Ptolemy points out that certain individuals are more resonant to the effects than others; namely those have the Sun or Moon in their horoscopes in the same degree as the eclipse, or the degree that directly opposes it.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Reference-Robbins_Tet|''Tetrabiblos'']]  II.8 (Loeb: [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Ptolemy/Tetrabiblos/2B*.html#8 p.191]).&lt;/ref&gt;

Within his  ''Almagest'' Ptolemy explains that he had access to eclipse records kept for 900 years since the beginning of the reign of king [[Nabonassar]] (747 BC).&lt;ref&gt;Ptolemy, [[#Reference-Almagest|''Almagest'' (2nd century)]] III.7.&lt;/ref&gt;  In chapter 9 of the ''Tetrabiblos'' he shows knowledge of the Babylonian lore that accompanied these records in detailing the omens based on visual phenomena.  The colours of eclipses and "the formations that occur near them, such as rods, halos, and the like" are considered&lt;ref&gt;[[#Reference-Robbins_Tet|''Tetrabiblos'']] II.9 (Loeb: [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Ptolemy/Tetrabiblos/2B*.html#9 p.193]): "For if they appear black or livid they signify the effects which were mentioned in connection with Saturn's nature; if white, those of Jupiter; if reddish, those of Mars; if yellow, those of Venus; and if variegated, those of Mercury. If the characteristic colour appears to cover the whole body of the luminary or the whole region surrounding it, the predicted event will affect most of the parts of the countries; but if it is in any one part, it will affect only that part against which the phenomenon is inclined".&lt;/ref&gt; along with the astrological significance of comets, in whether they take the form of "'beams', 'trumpets', 'jars', and the like".  Meaning is derived from their position relative to the Sun and assessment of "the parts of the zodiac in which their heads appear and through the directions in which the shapes of their tails point".&lt;ref&gt;[[#Reference-Robbins_Tet|''Tetrabiblos'']] II.9 (Loeb: [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Ptolemy/Tetrabiblos/2B*.html#9 p.193]).&lt;/ref&gt;  It is noted that here Ptolemy uses principles that fall outside the neat theoretical logic he presents in book I, being explicable only in terms of the mythological and omen tradition inherited from his ancient sources.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Reference-Riley88|Riley (1988)]] p.76. In footnote 15 Riley also notes [[Franz Boll (philologist)|Franz Boll]]’s argument that Ptolemy borrowed the structure of some components of this book from [[Posidonius]].&lt;/ref&gt;  He also defends the  subjective nature of the analysis involved, asserting that it would be impossible to mention the proper outcome of all this investigation, which calls for enterprise and ingenuity from the astrologer creating the judgement.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Reference-Robbins_Tet|''Tetrabiblos'']] II.8 Loeb:  [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Ptolemy/Tetrabiblos/2B*.html#8 p.189]): "Consequently questions of this kind would reasonably be left to the enterprise and ingenuity of the mathematician, [i.e., astrologer] in order to make the particular distinctions".&lt;/ref&gt;

The remaining chapters of book II are dedicated to meteorological matters.  Chapter 10 specifies that the new or full Moon preceding the Sun’s ingress into Aries can be used as a starting point for investigations concerning the weather patterns of the year. Lunations which precede the Sun’s ingress into any the other equinoctial and solstice signs (Cancer, Libra and Capricorn) can also be used for  seasonal concerns, and within these "monthly investigations" bring more particular details based on lunations and the conjunctions of the planets.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Reference-Robbins_Tet|''Tetrabiblos'']] II.10 (Loeb: [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Ptolemy/Tetrabiblos/2C*.html#10 p.199]).&lt;/ref&gt;  The recorded weather effects of the fixed stars in the zodiac constellations are systematically discussed, concluding with the relevance of generally observed sky phenomena such as shooting stars, cloud formations and rainbows.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Reference-Robbins_Tet|''Tetrabiblos'']] II.13 (Loeb:   [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Ptolemy/Tetrabiblos/2C*.html#13 p.219]).&lt;/ref&gt;  These final considerations are expected to add localised details to the original exploration of eclipse cycles. Ptolemy's theme throughout the book is that charts of this nature cannot be judged in isolation, but are to be understood within the pattern of cycles to which they belong, and where there are strong connections between the degree points involved; for:

{{quote|In every case… one should draw his conclusions on the principle that the universal and primary underlying cause takes precedence and that the cause of particular events is secondary to it, and that the force is most ensured and strengthened when the stars which are the lords of the universal natures are configurated with the particular causes.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Reference-Robbins_Tet|''Tetrabiblos'']] II.12 (Loeb:   [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Ptolemy/Tetrabiblos/2C*.html#12 p.213]).&lt;/ref&gt;}}

With the astrologer expected to have knowledge and awareness of the mundane cycles that outline the background principles of the personal horoscope, Ptolemy closes this book with the promise that the next will supply "with due order" the procedure which allows predictions based on the horoscopes of individuals.

==Book III: Individual horoscopes (genetic influences and predispositions)==

Books III and IV explore what Ptolemy terms "the genethlialogical art": the interpretation of a horoscope set for the moment of the birth of an individual.&lt;ref name="Tp221"&gt;[[#Reference-Robbins_Tet|''Tetrabiblos'']] III.1 (Loeb: [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Ptolemy/Tetrabiblos/3A*.html#1 pp.221–7]).&lt;/ref&gt;  He explains that there are several cycles of life to consider but the starting point for all investigation is the time of conception or birth.  The former "the genesis of the seed"” allows knowledge of events that precede the birth; the latter "the genesis of the man" is "more perfect in potentiality"&lt;ref name="Tp221" /&gt;  because when the child leaves the womb and comes "forth into the light under the appropriate conformation of the heavens" the temperament, disposition and physical form of the body is set.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Reference-Robbins_Tet|''Tetrabiblos'']] III.1 (Loeb: [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Ptolemy/Tetrabiblos/3A*.html#1 p.225]). This explanation was mirrored in subsequent discussions on why the moment of birth is more reliable, though not separate, from the moment of conception. For example, Johannes Kepler was following Ptolemy when he wrote in his ''Tertius Interveniens'' (1610): "When a human being's life is first ignited, when he now has his own life, and can no longer remain in the womb - then he receives a character and an imprint of all the celestial configurations (or the images of the rays intersecting on earth), and retains them unto his grave". See [http://cura.free.fr/docum/15kep-en.html 7.1] of ''Translated excerpts'' by Dr. Kenneth G. Negus on [http://cura.free.fr Cura], retrieved 17 November 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; The two moments are described as being linked by a "very similar causative power", so that the seed of the conception takes independent form at an astrologically suitable moment, whereby the impulse to give birth occurs under a "configuration of similar type to that which governed the child's formation in detail in the first place".&lt;ref name="Tp221" /&gt;  Chapter 2 continues this theme in discussing the importance of calculating the precise degree of the ascendant at birth, the difficulty of recording local time precisely enough to establish this,&lt;ref&gt;[[#Reference-Robbins_Tet|''Tetrabiblos'']] III.2 (Loeb: [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Ptolemy/Tetrabiblos/3A*.html#2 p.231]).&lt;/ref&gt;  and the methods available for [[Natal chart#Rectification|rectification]] (''i.e''., ensuring the chart is correct).&lt;ref&gt;Ptolemy’s method involves consideration of the preceding [[Syzygy (astronomy)|syzygy]] (New or Full Moon before birth). The text explains the principles of the ancient astrological technique elsewhere known as the 'Animodar method of rectification' (or 'System/Trutine of Hermes') which became a standard rectification procedure for Medieval and Renaissance astrologers.&lt;/ref&gt;

Chapter 3 describes how the analysis of the chart is divided into predictions of:
# essential, genetic qualities established prior to birth (such family and parental influences),
# those that become known at the birth (such as the sex of the child and birth defects), and
# those that can only be known post-natally (such as length of life, the quality of the mind, illnesses, marriage, children, and material fortunes).

Ptolemy explains the order by which each theme becomes relevant, and follows this in his arrangement of topics presented in the remaining chapters of books III and IV.

First he deals with the prenatal matters, covering the astrological significators of the parents in chapter 4, and siblings in chapter 5.  Then he deals with the matters "directly concerned with the birth",&lt;ref&gt;[[#Reference-Robbins_Tet|''Tetrabiblos'']] III.6 (Loeb: [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Ptolemy/Tetrabiblos/3A*.html#6  p.255]).&lt;/ref&gt;  explaining how to judge such issues as whether the child will be male or female (ch.6); whether the birth will produce twins or multiple children (ch.7); and whether it will involve physical defects or monstrous forms; if so, whether these are accompanied by mental deficiency, notability or honour (ch.8).&lt;ref&gt;For example ([http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Ptolemy/Tetrabiblos/3A*.html#8 III.8]): "if even in this case not one of the beneficent planets bears witness to any of the places mentioned, the offspring are entirely irrational and in the true sense of the word nondescript; but if Jupiter or Venus bears witness, the type of monster will be honoured and seemly, such as is usually the case with hermaphrodites or the so called harpocratiacs [deaf mutes]".&lt;/ref&gt;

|quote     = "The consideration of the length of life takes the leading place among inquiries about events following birth, for, as the ancient says, it is ridiculous to attach particular predictions to one who, by the constitution of the years of his life, will never attain at all to the time of the predicted events. This doctrine is no simple matter, nor unrelated to others, but in complex fashion derived from the domination of the places of greatest authority."

The exploration of post-natal concerns begins in chapter 9 with a review of astrological factors that occur when children are not reared. This considers the indications of still births and babies that seem "half-dead", or those that have been left exposed (including whether  there is possibility they may be taken up and live). Chapter 10 then details the techniques for establishing the length of life under normal circumstances. This is an important and lengthy passage of text, the techniques of which require precise astronomical detail and advanced knowledge of complex progressive techniques. Jim Tester has commented on how Ptolemy goes into  an unusual level of detail&lt;ref&gt;[[#Reference-Tester-1987|Tester (1987)]] [https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=-szKaDqpFhUC&amp;lpg=PA84&amp;ots=aAB6g1toUX&amp;dq=Astrology%2C%20length%20of%20life%2C%20Ptolemy&amp;pg=PA84#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false p.84]: "That the topic was of great importance is shown by the length of Ptolemy’s chapter and the number of illustrations he gives to help the reader understand an immensely complex procedure.  This is very unusual since Ptolemy tends to avoid details of practice, and consequently needs and uses few illustrations".&lt;/ref&gt; in a responsibility that [[Auguste Bouché-Leclercq|Bouché-Leclercq]] described as "the chief task of astrology, the operation judged most difficult by practitioners, most dangerous and damnable by its enemies".&lt;ref&gt;[[#Reference-Tester-1987|Tester (1987)]] [https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=-szKaDqpFhUC&amp;lpg=PA84&amp;ots=aAB6g1toUX&amp;dq=Astrology%2C%20length%20of%20life%2C%20Ptolemy&amp;pg=PA84#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false p.84]. Original source given as ''L’astrologie greque'', 404 (Paris: Leroux, 1899).&lt;/ref&gt; Such a prediction  involves judicial skill as well as mathematical expertise since several 'destructive' periods may be identified but countered by other, protective astrological influences, resulting in periods of danger or illness that does not lead to death.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Reference-Robbins_Tet|''Tetrabiblos'']] III.10 (Loeb:  [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Ptolemy/Tetrabiblos/3B*.html#10 p.285]).&lt;/ref&gt; This is followed, in chapter 11, by the astrological principles from which judgement is made of bodily appearance and temperament. The planetary significations follow the logic of their humoral associations, so that Jupiter (associated with warmth and moisture, an humoral combination which promotes growth) gives largeness in bodily form.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Reference-Riley88|Riley (1988)]] p.68.&lt;/ref&gt;  Since these define, to some extent, predisposition towards bodily afflictions, there is a natural flow towards the content of chapter 12, which focuses on the astrological significators relating to injuries and diseases. The details of planetary associations with bodily organs and functions are given, such as Saturn ruling the spleen and Jupiter the lungs. Jim Tester has pointed out that several lists of this type exist "more or less agreeing in detail".&lt;ref name="tester61"&gt;[[#Reference-Tester-1987|Tester (1987)]]  [https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=L0HSvH96alIC&amp;lpg=PA57&amp;dq=Tester%20Ptolemy&amp;pg=PA61#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false p.61].&lt;/ref&gt;

The third book concludes with a discussion in chapters 13 and 14 of what is described as a "largely overlooked" facet of Ptolemaic doctrine: the "psychological" one, which concerns the quality of the soul (or ''psyche'').&lt;ref name="Cam"&gt;Campion, Nicholas, 'Astronomy and the Soul', in [[#Reference-Tym|Tymieniecka (2010)]] p.250.&lt;/ref&gt; Historian [[Nicholas Campion]] has discussed the roots of the notion that  celestial and psychological realms are connected, which can be traced to the 6th century BC, and in Ptolemy's case presents a mixture of [[Aristotelianism|Aristotelian]] and [[Stoicism|Stoic]] philosophy, resting on the [[Platonism|Platonic]] view that "the soul comes from the heavens" which explains "how human character comes to be determined by the heavens".&lt;ref&gt;Campion, Nicholas, 'Astronomy and the Soul', in [[#Reference-Tym|Tymieniecka (2010)]] p.251 (acknowledging reference to [[Van der Waerden]], Bartel, (1974) ''Science awakening'', vol. II, 'The birth of astronomy'. Leyden and New York: Oxford University Press).&lt;/ref&gt;

The soul, for Ptolemy,  includes the faculty for conscious reasoning, which is rational and attributed to the condition of Mercury, and the subconscious and unconscious elements of the mind (the "sensory and irrational part"), which is sensitive and attributed to the condition of the Moon.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Reference-Robbins_Tet|''Tetrabiblos'']] III.13 (Loeb: [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Ptolemy/Tetrabiblos/3D*.html#13 p.333]). See also Campion in [[#Reference-Tym|Tymieniecka (2010)]] p.251.&lt;/ref&gt; These two chapters make analysis of instinctual impulses and moral inclinations, being concerned with psychological motives and behavioural expression rather than the physical temperament described in chapter 11. Diseases of the soul are defined as "affections which are utterly disproportionate and as it were pathological"&lt;ref name="Tp365"&gt;[[#Reference-Robbins_Tet|''Tetrabiblos'']] III.14 (Loeb: [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Ptolemy/Tetrabiblos/3D*.html#4  pp.365–9]).&lt;/ref&gt;  including insanity, inability to exercise moderation or restraint, instability of the emotions, depraved sexuality, morbid perversions, and violent afflictions of the intellectual and passive parts of the mind. The astrological explanations are mainly related to the exaggerated influence of destructive planets which are also in difficult configurations with Mercury and the Sun or Moon, or the planet associated with the psychological impulse (for example, Venus in matters of sexuality).&lt;ref name="Tp365" /&gt; Campion has pointed out that these planetary associations with psychological qualities are not original to Ptolemy, being present in the ''[[Corpus Hermeticum]]'' which was in circulation in Alexandria at the time Ptolemy compiled his text.&lt;ref name="Cam" /&gt;{{Rp|254}}

Within this book Ptolemy has surveyed all the topics that relate to inner qualities, genetic patterns, predispositions and the natural tendencies present from birth.  His exploration of individual horoscopes continues into book IV, the only distinction of content being that subsequent topics relate to material matters and life experiences: what Ptolemy refers to as "external accidentals".&lt;ref name="IVi"&gt;[[#Reference-Robbins_Tet|''Tetrabiblos'']] IV.1 (Loeb: [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Ptolemy/Tetrabiblos/4A*.html#1 p.373]).&lt;/ref&gt;

==Book IV: Individual horoscopes (external accidentals)==
[[File:Ptolemaicsystem-small.png|left|thumb|Ptolemy's geocentric celestial spheres; Peter Apian's ''Cosmographia'' (1539)]] 
Book IV is presented with a brief introduction to reaffirm  the arrangement of content as previously described. It starts with the topics of riches and honour. Ptolemy says: "as material fortune is associated with the properties of the body, so honour belongs to those of the soul".&lt;ref name="IVi" /&gt;  Chapter 2, on material wealth, employs the "so-called '[[Part of fortune|Lot of Fortune]]'" although Ptolemy's instruction conflicts with that of many of his contemporaries in stating that for its calculation "we measure from the horoscope the distance from the sun to the moon, in both diurnal and nocturnal nativities".&lt;ref&gt;[[#Reference-Robbins_Tet|''Tetrabiblos'']] IV.1 (Loeb: [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Ptolemy/Tetrabiblos/4A*.html#1  p.373]).&lt;/ref&gt;  Ptolemy's reputation ensured this approach to calculation was adopted by many later Medieval and Renaissance astrologers,&lt;ref&gt;[[#Reference-Lilly|Lilly (1647)]] p.143, (for example) repeats the instruction according to Ptolemy in his chapter 23: 'Of the Part of Fortune and how to take it, either by day or night'.&lt;/ref&gt; although it is now realised that most Hellenistic astrologers reversed the formula of calculation for [[Astrology of sect|nocturnal births]]. It is notable that in his discussion "Of the fortune of Dignity", in chapter three, Ptolemy makes no reference to the [[Part of fortune|Lot of Spirit]] (or ''Daimon''), which would normally be used as the spiritual counterpart to the material wealth and happiness associated with the Lot of Fortune. This is viewed as a demonstration of his general dislike (declared in bk. III.3)  for "lots and numbers of which no reasonable explanation can be given".&lt;ref&gt;Greenbaum, Dorian G., 'Calculating the Lots of Fortune and Daemon in Hellenistic astrology', in [[#Reference-Burnett|Burnett and Greenbaum (2007)]] pp.171–173, 184–5.&lt;/ref&gt;

The subsequent chapter, the title of which is translated by Robbins as 'Of the Quality of Action', concerns professional inclinations and the significators of career advance (or decline). This is followed by the treatment of marriage in chapter 5, which is primarily referred to the Moon in a man's chart, to describe his wife, and the Sun in a woman's chart to describe her husband.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Reference-Robbins_Tet|''Tetrabiblos'']] IV.5 (Loeb: [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Ptolemy/Tetrabiblos/4B*.html#5 pp.393–5]).&lt;/ref&gt; Here Ptolemy shows employment of the astrological technique known as [[synastry]], in which the planetary positions of two separate horoscopes are compared with each other for indications of relationship harmony or enmity.

The next four chapters complete the survey of natal themes, dealing with the topics of children (ch.6); friends and enemies (ch.7); the dangers of foreign travel (ch.8) and the quality (or type) of death (ch.9 – as opposed to the time of death considered in III.10).

The final chapter of the work is described as "a curious one"&lt;ref&gt;[[#Reference-Tester-1987|Tester (1987)]] [https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=-szKaDqpFhUC&amp;lpg=PA84&amp;ots=aAB6g1toUX&amp;dq=Astrology%2C%20length%20of%20life%2C%20Ptolemy&amp;pg=PA84#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false p.84].&lt;/ref&gt; for introducing a separate theme at the end of the book. This refers to the seven 'ages of man', which Ptolemy briefly mentioned in III.1 as a matter which varies the emphasis of astrological configurations according to the time in life they occur: "we predict events that will come about at specific times and vary in degree, following the so called ages of life.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Reference-Robbins_Tet|''Tetrabiblos'']] III.3 (Loeb:  [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Ptolemy/Tetrabiblos/3A*.html#1 p.223]).&lt;/ref&gt;
His argument is that, just as an astrologer must consider cultural differences "lest he mistake the appropriate customs and manners by assigning, for example, marriage with a sister to one who is Italian by race, instead of to the Egyptian as he should",&lt;ref name="bare_url"&gt;[[#Reference-Robbins_Tet|''Tetrabiblos'']] IV.10 (Loeb:  [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Ptolemy/Tetrabiblos/4C*.html#10 pp.439–441]).&lt;/ref&gt; it is necessary to consider the age in life that important astrological events occur. This is to ensure the prediction will "harmonise those details which are contemplated in temporal terms with that which is suitable and possible for persons in the various age-classes" and avoid out-of-context predictions such as imminent marriage for a young child, or "to an extremely old man the begetting of children or anything else that fits younger men".&lt;ref name="bare_url" /&gt; This leads into a discussion of the planetary themes of the seven ages of life which:

{{quote|...for likeness and comparison depends upon the order of the seven planets; it begins with the first age of man and with the first sphere from us, that is, the moon's, and ends with the last of the ages and the outermost of the planetary spheres, which is called that of Saturn.&lt;ref name="bare_url" /&gt;}}

The information in the passage can be summarised as follows:&lt;ref&gt;[[#Reference-Robbins_Tet|''Tetrabiblos'']] IV.10 (Loeb:  [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Ptolemy/Tetrabiblos/4C*.html#10 pp.443–447]).&lt;/ref&gt;

The book ends with a brief discussion of astronomical and symbolic cycles used in the prediction of timed events, which includes mention of (primary) directions, annual profections, ingresses, lunations and transits.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Reference-Robbins_Tet|''Tetrabiblos'']] IV.10 (Loeb:  [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Ptolemy/Tetrabiblos/4C*.html#10 pp.451–455]). For more on these techniques see [[Astrological progression]].&lt;/ref&gt;

The translator of the [[Loeb]] 1940 English translation, F. E. Robbins, reports a "puzzling problem" regarding the final paragraph of the book. One group of manuscripts have either been left unconcluded or supplied with text that matches an ''Anonymous Paraphrase'' of the work (speculatively attributed to Proclus); the other presents text which is the same in general content, but longer, according with manuscripts that were transmitted through Arabic translations.&lt;ref name="ending"&gt;[[#Reference-Robbins_Tet|Robbins (1940)]] 'Translator's Introduction',  [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Ptolemy/Tetrabiblos/Introduction*.html p.xxi].&lt;/ref&gt; Robbins considers it certain that the ending which concurs with the text of the ''Paraphrase'' is spurious. Robert Schmidt, the English translator of the later [[Project Hindsight]] edition agrees with his choice, stating that the text of the latter "sounds more generally Ptolemaic".&lt;ref&gt;[[#Reference-Schmidt|Schmidt (1998)]] book IV, p.50.&lt;/ref&gt;

Robbins explains that the lack of an ending usually occurs when ancient books are compiled in the form of a [[codex]] rather than a roll. Since the ''Paraphrase'' edition of the ''Tetrabiblos'' aimed to present the work's meaning without Ptolemy’s own complicated style of text construction, Robbins says that he "cannot conceive how anyone (except perhaps Ptolemy) could have reversed the process and evolved the tortuous, crabbed Greek of the latter from the comparatively simple language of the former".&lt;ref name="ending" /&gt; He therefore offers both versions of the ending whilst lending his support to that which is found in the Arabic version of the text. This has the book conclude with Ptolemy declaring  "since the topic of nativities has been summarily reviewed, it would be well to bring this procedure also to a fitting close".&lt;ref&gt;[[#Reference-Robbins_Tet|''Tetrabiblos'']] IV.10 (Loeb:  [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Ptolemy/Tetrabiblos/4C*.html#10 p.459]). See also [[#Reference-Robbins_Tet|Robbins (1940)]] 'Translator's Introduction', [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Ptolemy/Tetrabiblos/Introduction*.html  p.xxi] for discussion of the variants. The comment quoted is from  the ending according to Parisinus 2425.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Editions and translations ==
No original manuscripts of the text have survived; its contents are known from translations, fragments, paraphrased copies, commentaries and later Greek manuscripts.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Reference-Riley|Riley (1974)]] p.235.&lt;/ref&gt;  Astrological researcher Deborah Houlding, in an analysis of how specific points agree or vary between different editions, suggests that areas of conflicting details have been affected by three main streams of transmission: manuscripts that have passed through Arabic translation; those based on a paraphrased edition, and manuscripts that are dated four centuries later than the Arabic ones, but which have not undergone translation out of Greek.&lt;ref name="HT"&gt;Houlding, Deborah 'Ptolemy's terms and conditions: the transmission of Ptolemy's terms; an historical overview, comparison and interpretation', in [[#Reference-Burnett|Burnett and Greenbaum (2007)]]; reproduced online at [http://www.skyscript.co.uk/pdf/Houlding_ptolemy_terms.pdf Skyscript] (see p.3–4,6,11,15); retrieved 7 December 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Arabic translations===
The oldest extant manuscript is an Arabic translation compiled in the 9th century by [[Hunayn ibn Ishaq]]. This was first translated into Latin, in Barcelona, by [[Plato Tiburtinus|Plato de Tivoli]] in 1138 and became influential as the first complete introduction of Ptolemy's astrological work in Medieval Europe. It  survives in at least nine manuscripts and five Renaissance printings.&lt;ref&gt;See Houlding in [[#Reference-Burnett|Burnett and Greenbaum (2007)]] p.277; and Charles Burnett's 'notice' in the preface to the reproduction of Plato de Tivoli's translation by Johannes Hervagius in 1533 (available in digital format by the [http://warburg.sas.ac.uk/pdf/fah750pto.pdf Warburg Institute] (retrieved 19 November 2011).&lt;/ref&gt;

Other Latin translations made from Arabic sources include an anonymous (unpublished) work compiled in 1206 and another of the 13th century by Egidio Tebaldi (Aegidius de Thebaldis).&lt;ref&gt;Heilen, Stephan, 'Ptolemy's Doctrine of the Terms and its Reception', in [[#Reference-Jones-2010|Jones (2010)]] p.70.&lt;/ref&gt; Typically, the Latin translations made from Arabic texts were circulated with a commentary compiled by [[Ali ibn Ridwan]] (Haly) in the 11th century.&lt;ref name="w"&gt;[[#Reference-Westman|Westman (2011)]] p.43&lt;/ref&gt;

Egidio Tebaldi's translation was first published by [[Erhard Ratdolt]] in 1484 together with Haly's commentary and a "pseudo-Ptolemaic" list of aphorisms known as the ''[[Centiloquium]]''. This has been described as "the creature of late-fifteenth-century Italian presses".&lt;ref name="w" /&gt;

===Paraphrase based editions===
An anonymous Greek paraphrase is speculatively attributed to the 5th-century philosopher [[Proclus]]. It is often referred to as the ''Proclus' Paraphrase'' although its authenticity is questioned, being described as "very doubtful" by Professor Stephan Heilen.&lt;ref name="heilen"&gt;Heilen, Stephan, 'Ptolemy's Doctrine of the Terms and its Reception', in [[#Reference-Jones-2010|Jones (2010)]], [https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=Y61qolT7m98C&amp;lpg=PA66&amp;ots=6eFk3oRj6L&amp;dq=Porphyry%20paraphrase%20ptolemy&amp;pg=PA45#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false pp.62–63].&lt;/ref&gt;  The content of the ''Paraphrase'' is close to that of manuscripts of the ''Tetrabiblos'', but it uses simplified text  with the aim of providing what Heilen calls "a more easily understandable version of the difficult original work".&lt;ref name="heilen" /&gt;

There is no modern critical edition of this text.&lt;ref name="heilen" /&gt; The oldest extant manuscript is dated to the 10th century and housed in the [[Vatican Library]] (Ms. ''Vaticanus gr.1453, S. X.'', ff.1–219).&lt;ref name="HT" /&gt;{{Rp|269}} Some of the text of the ''Paraphrase'' was published with a Latin translation and Preface by [[Philipp Melanchthon]] in Basel, 1554, but this was not widely circulated.&lt;ref name="HT" /&gt;{{Rp|265}}  A full reproduction with an accompanying Latin translation was made around 1630 by the Vatican scholar [[Leo Allatius]] "for his own private gratification" and this was published by the [[House of Elzevir|Elzevir]] typsetters in [[Leiden]], 1635, apparently without Allatius's knowledge or consent.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Reference-Ashmans|Ashmand (1822)]] 'Preface' [http://www.sacred-texts.com/astro/ptb/ptb03.htm#fn_8 pp.xvii]. The unknown author of the 'Address' in the 1635 Elzevir edition reports that it "was translated a few years ago" and says of its author Allatius: "He ... holds some office in the Vatican Library. He undertook his present work, however, for his own private gratification, and that of certain friends; but when writings compiled with this view have once quitted their author's hands, it will often happen that they have also, at the same time, escaped his control."&lt;/ref&gt;

Allatius' Latin translation was used as the source of all English translations of the ''Tetrabiblos'' prior to the Robbins' edition of 1940.&lt;ref name="HT" /&gt;{{Rp|266}} These include translations made by John Whalley (1701); the Whalley "corrected edition" made by [[Ebenezer Sibly]] and his brother (1786); J.M. Ashmand (1822); James Wilson (1828); and other 19th-century privately circulated manuscripts such as that of John Worsdale.&lt;ref&gt;See Houlding, in [[#Reference-Burnett|Burnett and Greenbaum (2007)]], p.266 n.12, for discussion of the earlier English language editions.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Greek manuscripts===
Although no copies of Ptolemy's original manuscript remain, there are other ancient works, such as [[Hephaistio]]'s ''Apotelesmatics I'',  which describe or reproduce some of its passages. These have been used to help verify disputed areas of content.&lt;ref name="HT" /&gt;{{Rp|275}}

The oldest fairly complete Greek manuscript of the text (rather than the paraphrased edition made of it) is dated to the 13th century. Two or three others are dated to the 14th century but most are dated to the 15th and 16th centuries.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Reference-Robbins_Tet|Robbins (1940)]] 'Translator's Introduction' IV, in particular  [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Ptolemy/Tetrabiblos/Introduction*.html p.xviii]. See also [[#Reference-Hubner|Hübner (1998)]] p.xiii.&lt;/ref&gt; In the 'Introduction' to his 1940's translation, Frank Eggleston Robbins reported the existence of at least 35 manuscripts containing all or a large part of the ''Tetrabiblos'' in European libraries.&lt;ref name=RR&gt;[[#Reference-Robbins_Tet|Robbins (1940)]] 'Translator's Introduction' [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Ptolemy/Tetrabiblos/Introduction*.html p.xxiii].&lt;/ref&gt;

The first printed edition was made in 1535 with an accompanying Latin translation by the German classical scholar [[Joachim Camerarius]]. This was reprinted in 1553 and is "notable for offering the first Latin translation based upon a Greek rather than Arabic source".&lt;ref name="HT" /&gt;{{Rp|269}} Robbins noted the page numbers of the 1553 edition in the Greek text which faces his English translation, stating "My collations have been made against Camerarius' second edition, because thus far this has been the standard text and it was most convenient".&lt;ref name="RR" /&gt;

Also in 1940, a Greek critical edition was published by [[Teubner]], in Germany, based on the unpublished work of [[Franz Boll (philologist)|Franz Boll]] which was completed by his student Emilie Boer. Robbins expressed regret at not being able to refer to this in the preparation of his English translation.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Reference-Robbins_Tet|Robbins (1940)]] 'Translator's Introduction' [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Ptolemy/Tetrabiblos/Introduction*.html p.xiv]: "Professor Franz Boll, whose studies of Ptolemy have been cited many times already, had begun work upon a new edition of the ''Tetrabiblos'' prior to his lamented death, July 3, 1924. His pupil, Fräulein Emilie Boer, however, continued Boll’s task, and the appearance of their completed text has been awaited since 1926. I regret very much that my own work on the present text and translation could not have profited from the results of the textual studies of these two scholars".&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1994 the 'Boll-Boer' edition became the basis of a serialised English translation by Robert Schmidt, published by [[Project Hindsight]]. The 'Translator's Preface' was critical of Robbins' understanding of some of the "conceptual issues involved" and argued the need for a new English translation which recognised the "probable superiority of the Teubner text edited by Boll and Boer in 1940".&lt;ref&gt;[[#Reference-Schmidt|Schmidt (1994)]] book I, p.vii–viii.&lt;/ref&gt;

The most recent critical edition of the Greek text was made by the German scholar Professor Wolfgang Hübner, and published by Teubner in 1998. Based on 33 complete and 14 partial manuscripts, Hübner also incorporated the unpublished notes of Boer and the reasoning given in the Robbins and Boll-Boer editions.&lt;ref name="HT" /&gt;{{Rp|273}} This is now considered the authoritative edition. A reviewer’s comment in The ''Classical Review'' declares of it "Progress over previous editions is evident on virtually every page".&lt;ref&gt;Tiziano Dorandi, ''The Classical Review'' (2000), New Series, Vol. 50, No. 1, pp. 30–32 (reported by Houlding in [[#Reference-Burnett|Burnett and Greenbaum (2007)]] p.273).&lt;/ref&gt;

===Commentary===
In addition to the Arabic commentary on the ''Tetrabiblos'' made by [[Ali ibn Ridwan]] (Haly) in the 11th century,&lt;ref name="G"&gt;[[#Reference-Grafton|Grafton (1999)]] [https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=GhkxjStiZfwC&amp;lpg=PA137&amp;dq=centiloquium%20ptolemy&amp;pg=PA137#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false pp.136–7].&lt;/ref&gt;
significant attention is given to an anonymous Greek ''Commentary'', which has older, obscure origins. It was written at an uncertain date, in either late antiquity or the [[Byzantine]] period. This is also attributed to Proclus, as the presumed author of the ''Paraphrase'', although Heilen has remarked that such an attribution "looks like guesswork".&lt;ref name="heilen3"&gt;Heilen, Stephan, 'Ptolemy's Doctrine of the Terms and its Reception', in [[#Reference-Jones-2010|Jones (2010)]], [https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=Y61qolT7m98C&amp;lpg=PA66&amp;ots=6eFk3oRj6L&amp;dq=Porphyry%20paraphrase%20ptolemy&amp;pg=PA45#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false pp.65–66].&lt;/ref&gt;  Houlding has also pointed out that differences in tabulated information presented within the ''Paraphrase'' and the ''Commentary'' "is a telling argument that both cannot be the work of the same author".&lt;ref name="HT" /&gt;{{Rp|274}}

The Greek ''Commentary'' was first printed in 1559 with an accompanying Latin translation by [[Hieronymus Wolf]]. This claimed to be based on a heavily corrupted manuscript which required numerous conjectures by a scholarly friend of Wolf, who preferred to remain anonymous rather than face reproaches for "dabbling in this sort of literature".&lt;ref name="heilen3" /&gt; Wolf's edition was bound with an ''Introduction to the Tetrabiblos'', attributed (speculatively) to [[Porphyry (philosopher)|Porphyry]], and the [[scholia]] of Demophilus.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Reference-Robbins_Tet|Robbins (1940)]] 'Translator's Introduction', III [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Ptolemy/Tetrabiblos/Introduction*.html p.xvi].&lt;/ref&gt;

The purpose of the ''Commentary'' was to offer demonstrated illustrations and fuller explanation of the astrological principles described by Ptolemy. Following Wolf's edition, large passages were incorporated into Latin astrological works which featured extensive collections of example horoscopes. Two notable examples are [[Jerome Cardan]]'s ''Ptolemaei De Astrorvm Ivdiciis'' (Basel, 1578) and [[Francisco Junctinus]]'s ''Speculum Astrologiae'' (Lugduni, 1583).&lt;ref name="HT" /&gt;{{Rp|273}} Modern translators continue to make reference to the Hieronymous Wolf ''Commentary'' in their explanatory annotations.&lt;ref&gt;See for example, [[#Reference-Robbins_Tet|Robbins (1940)]] [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Ptolemy/Tetrabiblos/1B*.html#note110 p.98, n.2] and [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Ptolemy/Tetrabiblos/1B*.html#note116 p.106, n.2].&lt;/ref&gt;

===Centiloquium===
{{Main|Centiloquium}}
The  ''[[Centiloquium]]'' 'one hundred (sayings)' was the common Latin title of a  collection of 100 important astrological [[aphorism]]s. It was also known in Latin as ''Liber Fructus'' (Arabic: ''Kitab al-Tamara''; Hebrew: ''Sefer ha-Peri'') 'Book of the Fruit'.&lt;ref name="Sela"&gt;[[#Reference-Sela-2003|Sela (2003)]] [https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=HvCns2cU6f0C&amp;pg=PA321 pp.321–2].&lt;/ref&gt; The latter reflected the belief that this offered a summation of Ptolemy's key astrological principles, and therefore presented "The Fruit of his Four Books".&lt;ref name="Hould-2006"&gt;[[#Reference-Houlding-2006|Houlding (2006)]] [http://www.skyscript.co.uk/centiloquium1.html 'Introduction'].&lt;/ref&gt; It began, as all Ptolemy's works did, with a dedication to "Syrus", which helped support the assumption of the work's Ptolemaic authenticity.&lt;ref name="G" /&gt;

Early manuscripts were commonly accompanied by a commentary on their use authored by [[Ahmad ibn Yusuf al-Misri]] (835–912).&lt;ref name="Sela" /&gt; This became translated into Latin at the same time as translations were being made of the Arabic editions of the ''Tetrabiblos''. The earliest translations were made by [[John of Seville|Johannes Hispanensis]] in 1136 and [[Plato Tiburtinus|Plato of Tivoli]] in 1138.&lt;ref name="Hould-2006" /&gt;

[[Ali ibn Ridwan]] (Haly), who had produced the Arabic commentary on Ptolemy's work, noticed that the aphorisms highlighted principles of [[horary astrology|interrogational]] astrology, and wondered why Ptolemy had not included coverage of these themes in his ''Tetrabiblos''.&lt;ref name="G" /&gt; Jerome Cardan was the first to declare the work a forgery based on such differences, referring in his commentary on the ''Tetrabiblos'' to an argument of [[Galen]]: "In the old days, kings who were trying to establish great libraries bought the books of famous men at very high prices. By doing so they caused men to ascribe their own works to the ancients".&lt;ref name="G" /&gt;

The authorship of the text is now ascribed to "Pseudo-Ptolemy". Some scholars suggest that Ahmad ibn Yusuf was its true author.&lt;ref name="Sela" /&gt; Others believe that the ''Centiloquium'', though not Ptolemy's, may preserve some collation of authentic materials from [[Hellenistic astrology]].&lt;ref&gt;[[#Reference-Houlding-2006|Houlding (2006)]] [http://www.skyscript.co.uk/centiloquium1.html 'Introduction']; [[#Reference-Tester-1987|Tester (1987)]] pp.[https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=L0HSvH96alIC&amp;pg=PA154 154–5].&lt;/ref&gt; Ultimately, the historical assumption that the ''Centiloquium'' was part of Ptolemy's astrological legacy gave it widespread influence in the medieval period, by which it became established as an important text within the astrological tradition.&lt;ref name="Hould-2006" /&gt;

'''''The Garden of Rama''''' is a 1991 novel by [[Gentry Lee]] and [[Arthur C. Clarke|Arthur&amp;nbsp;C. Clarke]]. It is the third book in the four-book ''Rama'' series: ''[[Rendezvous with Rama]]'', ''[[Rama II (novel)|Rama&amp;nbsp;II]]'', ''The Garden of Rama'', and ''[[Rama Revealed]]'', and follows on from where ''Rama&amp;nbsp;II'' left off.

==Plot summary==

The book picks up the story nine months after the end of ''[[Rama II (novel)|Rama II]]''. The book follows the story of three astronauts from the expedition in ''Rama II'' who were trapped aboard the cylindrical alien spacecraft, Rama II, heading out towards deep space. Along the journey, five children were born. Simone Tiasso Wakefield, Catharine Colin Wakefield, Eleanor Joan Wakefield, Benjamin Ryan O'Toole and Patrick Erin O'Toole, were born by Nicole des Jardins from her relationships with Richard Wakefield and Michael O'Toole. These children later become major characters in ''Rama Revealed''. After a twelve-year journey, they arrive in the vicinity of the star [[Sirius]], where all eight rendezvous with a Raman Node.

At the Node they are subjected to physiological tests for a year while Rama is refurbished, and they are eventually sent back to the solar system, this time to collect two thousand more representatives of humanity. An Earth agency, known as the ISA, receives the message from Rama requesting two thousand humans. Upon its reception, the message is kept secret and, under the guise of a new Martian colony, the ISA starts acquiring its payload. The ISA selects a handful of their own representatives; meanwhile, they selectively gather convicts and promise them freedom if they are chosen to be a colonist. The payload is subdivided into three ships: the Nina, Pinta, and Santa Maria (names based on [[Christopher Columbus]]'s ships [[Niña]], [[Pinta (ship)|Pinta]], and [[Santa María (ship)|Santa María]]) that arrive sequentially at Rama. At this point the colonists believe everything is a hoax (despite the colossal size of Rama) created by the ISA. With that discontent as the tone upon their arrival, Rama III heads back to deep space with its new payload.

Soon an aggressive group of humans, led by a mob boss, seizes control of the human colony and begins a war of annihilation and propaganda against one of the other races occupying the massive spacecraft. The original astronauts and their children find themselves powerless to prevent the [[genocide]]. However, the aggressive behavior of the human species does not go unnoticed: Another species, unknown to the humans, observe their behavior and start considering a possible counterattack.

Meanwhile, Rama III determines that total escalation of the conflict is imminent and transmits an emergency signal to its ancient constructors. The book ends with a [[cliffhanger]], on the eve of the execution of one of the original astronauts.

The '''''Lost Chapter of the Acts of the Apostles''''', also known as the ''Sonnini Manuscript'', is a short text purporting to be the translation of a manuscript containing the 29&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; chapter of the [[Acts of the Apostles]], detailing [[Paul the Apostle]]'s journey to [[Britannia]], where he preached to a [[Ten Lost Tribes|tribe of Israelites]] on [[Ludgate Hill]],{{citation needed|date=July 2018|reason=The alleged Acts 29:9 makes reference to a 'Mount Lud', although the previous verse has Paul arrive through the east gate, not the west.}} the site of [[St Paul's Cathedral]]. 

The canonical book of ''Acts'' ends rather abruptly with Paul kept under house arrest in chapter 28, which has led to various theories about the history of the text.&lt;ref name="Moore"/&gt;

==History==
The text made its first appearance in [[London]] in 1871.&lt;ref name="Moore"&gt;{{Cite book |last=Moore |first=Phil |date=2010 |title=Straight to the Heart of Acts: 60 bite-sized insights |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=fWAZBQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT269 |location=Oxford |publisher=Monarch Books |page=270 |isbn=9780857211781 |accessdate=19 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to the editor, it was translated in the late 18&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; century by the French [[Natural history|naturalist]] [[Sonnini de Manoncourt]] from a "Greek manuscript discovered in the archives at [[Constantinople]] and presented to him by the [[Abdul Hamid I|Sultan Abdoul Achmet]]". It was found hidden in an English translation of Sonnini's ''Voyage en Grèce et en Turquie'' in the library of Sir John Newport, MP (1756-1843) after the MP's death. However, no trace of any such manuscript has been found, and from internal evidence, mainstream philology considers it to most likely be a fraud, thus it is classed among the [[modern pseudepigrapha]].&lt;ref name="Moore"/&gt;

It is available in a 1982 edition by E. Raymond Capt ({{ISBN|0-934666-09-1}}) from Artisan Publishers, Muskogee, which is a publisher specializing in [[evangelicalism|evangelical]] fringe subjects.

==Purpose and influence==
The purpose of the book was likely to support [[Anglo-Israelism]]. The book has not found attention in recent mainstream publications and is not mentioned on the website of the [[British-Israel-World Federation]]. The influence of that movement has declined.

[[File:Transposing instrument- written sounds as.png|thumb|The [[Soprano clarinet|B{{music|flat}} clarinet]] is a transposing instrument. When the note C occurs in a score that is especially written for a B{{music|flat}} clarinet (''top''), the instrument will actually sound a B{{music|flat}} (''bottom''), hence the name of the instrument. The very same fingering when played on an [[Soprano clarinet|A clarinet]] will sound an A, and in a score for A clarinet, an A will be written as a C.]]

A '''transposing instrument''' is a [[musical instrument]] whose music is recorded in [[sheet music|staff notation]] at a [[pitch (music)|pitch]] different from the pitch that actually sounds ([[concert pitch]]). A written [[middle C]] on a transposing instrument produces a pitch other than middle C, and that pitch identifies the [[interval (music)|interval]] of transposition when describing the instrument. For example, a written C on a B{{music|flat}} [[clarinet]] sounds a concert B{{music|flat}}.

Rather than a property of the instrument, the [[transposition (music)|transposition]] is a convention of [[musical notation]]. Instruments whose music is typically notated in this way are called transposing instruments. As transposing instruments is a notation convention, the issue of transposition is mainly an issue for genres of music which use [[sheet music]], such as [[classical music]] and [[jazz]] (while jazz is an [[jazz improvisation|improvisation]]-based type of music, professional players are still expected to be able to read [[lead sheet]]s and [[big band]] sheet music). For some instruments (e.g., the [[piccolo]] or the [[double bass]]), the sounding pitch is still a C, but in a different [[octave]]; these instruments are said to transpose "at the octave".

== Reasons for transposing ==
=== Ease of switching instruments ===
Many instruments are members of a [[family (musical instruments)|family of instruments]] that differ mainly in size (see examples below). The instruments in these families have differing [[Range (music)|range]]s, with the members sounding lower as they get larger; but an identical pattern of [[Fingering (music)|fingering]]s on two instruments in the same family produces pitches a fixed interval apart. For example, the fingerings which produce the notes of a C major scale on a standard [[Western concert flute|flute]], a non-transposing instrument, produce a G major scale on an [[alto flute]]. As a result, these instruments' parts are notated so that the written notes are fingered the same way on each instrument, making it easier for a single instrumentalist to play several instruments in the same family.

Instruments that transpose this way are often referred to as being in a certain "key", such as the "A clarinet" or "clarinet in A". The instrument's key tells which pitch will sound when the player plays a note written as ''C''. A player of a B{{music|flat}} clarinet who reads a written C will sound a B{{music|flat}} while the player of an A clarinet will read the same note and sound an A. The non-transposing member of the family is thus called a "clarinet in C".

Examples of families of transposing instruments:
* [[cornet]]s
* [[saxhorn]]s

Examples of families of non-transposing instruments:
* [[trombone]]s&lt;ref name=Apel&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|editor=[[Willi Apel]]|title=Transposing Instruments|encyclopedia=[[Harvard Dictionary of Music]]|edition=second|year=1972|page=860|publisher=Harvard University Press|location=Cambridge, Massachusetts|isbn=0-674-37501-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[tuba]]s&lt;ref name=Apel /&gt;

Recorders are either untransposed or in some cases transposed at the octave. In the early 20th century, however, instruments with basic scales other than C were sometimes written as transposing instruments.

Examples of families with both transposing and non-transposing instruments:
* [[clarinet]]s
* [[flute]]s
* [[oboe]]s
* [[saxophone]]s
* [[trumpet]]s
The [[euphonium]], with its close relative the [[baritone horn]], may be played as either a [[treble clef]] instrument or a [[bass clef]] instrument because it is often played as a second instrument: trumpet or cornet players who [[doubling (disambiguation#Music|double]] on the euphonium are used to playing in treble clef, while trombone or tuba players who double on the euphonium are used to playing in bass clef. In both cases, the instrument plays in the same range as the trombone, i.e., it produces the same pitches. However, in treble clef, the euphonium is a transposing instrument, i.e., its music and fingering are set up as if it is a B{{music|flat}} instrument (transposing), while in bass clef, its music and fingering assume that it is a C instrument (non-transposing). Musicians who play both bass- and treble-clef euphonium must learn to use different fingerings for the written notes: e.g., a B{{music|flat}} in treble clef requires that the first valve be depressed, whereas a B{{music|flat}} in bass clef is open. 

===Horn crooks===
{{Unreferenced section|date=August 2015}}
Before valves were invented in the 19th century, [[Horn (instrument)|horns]] and [[Natural trumpet|trumpets]] could play only the notes of the [[harmonic series (music)|overtone series]] from a single [[fundamental frequency|fundamental]] pitch. (Exceptions included [[Slide (wind instrument)|slide-bearing]] versions such as the [[sackbut]] and finger-hole horns like the [[cornett]] and [[Serpent (instrument)|serpent]].) Beginning in the early 18th century, a system of [[crook (music)|crooks]] was devised in Germany, enabling this fundamental to be changed by inserting one of a set of crooks between the mouthpiece and the lead pipe of the instrument, increasing the total length of its sounding tube. As a result, all horn music was written as if for a fundamental pitch of C, but the crooks could make a single instrument a transposing instrument into almost any key. 

Changing these lead-pipe crooks was time-consuming, and even keeping them from falling out while playing was a matter of some concern to the player, so changing crooks could take place only during substantial rests. Medial crooks, inserted in the central portion of the instrument, were an improvement devised in the middle of the 18th century, and they could also be made to function as a slide for tuning, or to change the pitch of the fundamental by a semitone or tone. The introduction of valves made this process unnecessary, though many players and composers found the tone quality of valved instruments inferior ([[Richard Wagner]] sometimes wrote horn parts for both natural and valved horns together in the same piece). F transposition became standard in the early 19th century, with the horn sounding a perfect fifth below written pitch in treble clef. In bass clef, composers differed in whether they expected the instruments to transpose down a fifth or up a fourth.

=== Reconciling pitch standards ===

In the music of Germany during the Baroque period, and notably in the music of [[Johann Sebastian Bach]], instruments used for different purposes were often tuned to different pitch standards, called ''Chorton'' ("choir pitch") and ''Kammerton'' ("chamber [music] pitch"). When they played together in an ensemble, the parts of some instruments would then have to be transposed to compensate. In many of Bach's cantatas the organ part{{clarify|reason=Any source calls an organ tuned to a different pitch standard whose part is transposed to compensate the pitch difference a *transposing instrument*? The subject of this article is *Transposing instrument* and not Miscellaneous uses of transposition|date=February 2014}} is notated a full step lower than the other instruments.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=[[Laurence Dreyfus]]|title=Bach's Continuo Group|year=1987|publisher=Harvard University Press|location=Cambridge, Massachusetts|isbn=0-674-06030-X|page=11}}&lt;/ref&gt; See [[Concert pitch#Pitch inflation|pitch inflation]].

A few early-music ensembles of the present day must do something similar if they comprise some instruments tuned to A415 and others to [[A440 (pitch standard)|A440]], approximately a [[semitone]] apart. Modern builders of continuo instruments sometimes include [[Organ console#Keyboards|moveable keyboards]] which can play with either pitch standard.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hpschd.nu/tech/kb/trans.html|title=CBH Global Harpsichord Technology|author=Carey Beebe Harpsichords Australia}}&lt;/ref&gt; The harpsichord has a single string for each note, plucked by a plectrum and the difference in pitch between the Baroque A at 415&amp;nbsp;Hz and the "modern" A at 440&amp;nbsp;Hz is one half step. Moving the keyboard mechanism right or left causes the A key to play the next string, namely the A{{music|#}} at 440&amp;nbsp;Hz or the A{{music|b}} at 392&amp;nbsp;Hz respectively. Movement of the keyboard allows one to play higher or lower, though the topmost or bottommost key will not produce sound unless the builder has provided extra strings to accommodate the transposition feature.

== Transposition at the octave ==
{{See also|Clef#Octave clefs}}
If an instrument has a range too high or too low for composers to easily write its music on bass or treble clef, the music may be written either an [[octave]] higher or an octave lower than it sounds, in order to reduce the use of [[ledger line]]s. Instruments that "transpose at the octave" are not playing in a different [[key (music)|key]] from concert pitch instruments, but sound an octave higher or lower than written. Music for the [[double bass]] is written an octave higher than it sounds. Thus, when cellos and basses are reading exactly the same part (a common practice by composers from the early Classical period), the basses' bassline is an octave below the cellos'.

Most authorities include this type of notation under the umbrella "transposing instruments",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|title=[[Harvard Dictionary of Music]]|edition=second|editor=[[Willi Apel]]|year=1972|contribution=Transposing Instruments}}. According to this article, if an octave-transposing clef is used (with a little 8 above or below, the term "transposition" does not apply.&lt;/ref&gt; although it's different from the way the term [[transposition (music)|transposing]] is used in other musical contexts.

== Mechanical and physical considerations ==
Most [[woodwind instrument]]s have one major scale whose execution involves lifting the fingers more or less sequentially from the bottom to top. This scale is usually the one notated as a C scale (from C to C, with no sharps or flats) for that instrument. The note written as C sounds as the note of the instrument's transposition: on an E{{music|flat}} alto saxophone, that note sounds as a concert E{{music|flat}}, while on an A clarinet, that note sounds as a concert A. Clarinets are one exception, in that they actually have two different scales in the first and second registers, nominally an F scale and a C scale, but treated by the performer as sounding "at pitch" for a C clarinet. The [[bassoon]] is another exception; it is not a transposing instrument, yet its "home" scale is F (like the low register of the C clarinet).{{dubious|date=November 2016}}

[[Brass instruments]], when played with no valves engaged (or, for [[trombone]]s, with the slide all the way in), play a series of notes that form the overtone series based on some fundamental pitch, e.g., the B{{music|flat}} [[trumpet]], when played with no valves engaged, can play the overtones based on B{{music|flat}}. Usually, that pitch is the note that indicates the transposition of that brass instrument. Trombones are an exception: they read at concert pitch, although tenor and bass trombones are pitched in B{{music|flat}}, alto trombone in E{{music|flat}}. Double horns are another exception, in that they combine two different sets of tubing into a single instrument, most characteristically in F and B{{Music|flat}}. The horn part is nevertheless transposed uniformly in F (and indeed seldom if ever specifies whether a double or single horn is to be used), with the player deciding when to switch from one side of the instrument to the other. Single B{{Music|flat}} horns also normally read from parts transposed in F.

In general, for these instruments there is some reason to consider a certain pitch the "home" note of an instrument, and that pitch is usually written as C for that instrument. The concert pitch of that note is what determines how we refer to the transposition of that instrument.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dwerden.com/eu-articles-bareuph.cfm |title=Baritone or Euphonium? |publisher=Dwerden.com |date=2017-07-20 |accessdate=2018-03-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Conductor's score==
In [[conducting|conductor]]s' scores and other [[full score]]s, music for transposing instruments is generally written in transposed form, just as in the players' parts. Some composers from the beginning of the 20th century onward have written orchestral scores entirely in concert pitch, e.g. the score of [[Sergei Prokofiev]]'s [[Piano Concerto No. 1 (Prokofiev)|Piano Concerto No. 1]] in D{{music|b}}.

Transposing instruments' names almost always use flats instead of sharps (thus there are instruments in E{{flat}} or in B{{flat}}, but these are never today{{Clarify|date=September 2016}}&lt;!--Was this done in the past?--&gt; called instruments in D{{sharp}} or in A{{sharp}}). In practice the actual transposition in the score may (for the convenience of the player) depend on the key of the music. For example, in a section in C major an E{{flat}} alto saxophone part will appear in A major (three sharps). But in a section in concert B major it would be impractical to notate the sax part in G{{sharp}} major part (a key with eight sharps, i.e. six sharps and one double-sharp). Instead, their part would appear in A{{flat}} major (four flats), just as if they were playing a D{{sharp}} instrument.

==Physical characteristics and formation==
[[File:Willamette-meteorite-7637.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Close-up of the meteorite]]
The Willamette Meteorite weighs about {{convert|32000|lb|kg}}. It is classified as a [[meteorite classification|type III iron meteorite]], being composed of over 91% [[iron]] and 7.62% [[nickel]], with traces of [[cobalt]] and [[phosphorus]]. The approximate dimensions of the meteorite are {{convert|10|feet|m|0}} tall by {{convert|6.5|feet|m|0}} wide by {{convert|4.25|feet|m|1}} deep. Most iron meteorites like Willamette have originated from the differentiated core of planetesimals or [[asteroid]]s that collided with another object. Willamette has a recrystallized structure with only traces of a medium [[Widmanstätten pattern]]; it is the result of a significant impact-heating event on the parent body.&lt;ref name=AMNH /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;^ Vagn F. Buchwald: Handbook of Iron Meteorites, University of California Press 1975.&lt;/ref&gt; The Willamette Meteorite contains higher concentrations of various metals that are quite rare in Earth's crust. For example, [[Iridium]], one of the least abundant elements in Earth's crust, is found in the Willamette Meteorite at a concentration of 4.7&amp;nbsp;[[Parts-per notation|ppm]]&lt;!-- vs. having an average mass fraction of 0.001&amp;nbsp;ppm in crustal rock --&gt;, thousands of times more than its crustal abundance&lt;!-- this image (https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/0/09/Elemental_abundances.svg) is used in a number of articles to show relative abundance of elements in Earth's crust; probably not appropriate for this article on the WM, but useful to show rarity of various elements. --&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=The chemical classification of iron meteorites—VII.

==Emplacement and erosion==
[[Image:Wpdms nasa topo missoula floods.jpg|thumbnail|right|[[Glacial Lake Columbia]] (west) and [[Lake Missoula|Glacial Lake Missoula]] (east, in blue) were south of Cordilleran Ice Sheet. The areas inundated in the Columbia and [[Missoula Floods]] are shown in red. The meteorite was rafted by the floods embedded inside an ice block.]]
The lack of an [[impact crater]] at the discovery site was only explained after the 1920s, with the new understanding about the [[Missoula Floods]], one of the largest floods documented, caused by the collapse of an ice barrier during the last deglaciation. The meteorite presumably landed on an ice cap in what is now [[Montana]] or western [[Canada]], and was dragged by the glacier ice to the vicinity of an ice barrier that formed across the [[Clark Fork River]]. This barrier had ponded a huge amount of water at the [[Lake Missoula]] right at the time when the meteorite reached the area and the ice barrier became unstable and breached. The resulting flood involved up to 10 million cubic meters per second of water discharge, with large blocks of ice rafting down the [[Columbia River]] and the [[Willamette Valley]] at the end of the last Ice Age (~13,000 years ago).&lt;ref name=Pugh /&gt; Some of these ice rafts included boulders (known as ''[[glacial erratic]]s'' by geologists) like the Willamette meteorite, which eventually sank in the flood waters and settled where they were found by humans.

The deep crevasses of the meteorite resulted from both its high-speed atmospheric entry and its subsequent weathering. Exposed to the elements for thousands of years, rainwater interacted with the mineral [[troilite]], resulting in a form of [[sulfuric acid]] which slowly dissolved portions of the meteorite. This resulted in the gradual development of the hollows that are visible today.

==Modern history==
The Willamette Meteorite was originally found in the Willamette Valley of Oregon near the modern city of [[West Linn, Oregon|West Linn]]. Although already known and sacred to Native Americans, it came to prominence due to the actions of settler Ellis Hughes in 1902. At that time the land was owned by the [[Oregon Iron Company|Oregon Iron and Steel Company]]. Hughes recognized the meteorite's significance, and in an attempt to claim ownership, secretly moved it to his own land. This involved 90 days of hard work to cover the 3/4 mile (1200 m) distance. The move was discovered, and after a lawsuit, the Oregon Supreme Court held that Oregon Iron and Steel Company was the legal owner.

In 1905, the meteorite was purchased by [[William E. Dodge]] for $26,000 (around $680,000 in 2011). After being displayed at the [[Lewis and Clark Centennial Exposition]], it was donated to the American Museum of Natural History in New York City, where it has since been on display since 1906.&lt;ref name="UofO"&gt;[http://natural-history.uoregon.edu/Pages/web/meteorite.htm Geology Tour.] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20051214235056/http://natural-history.uoregon.edu/Pages/web/meteorite.htm |date=2005-12-14}} University of Oregon: Museum of Natural History. Retrieved on October 31, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

The meteorite was venerated by the [[Clackamas people]] inhabiting the area where it was found. The CTGRC, a confederation of [[Native Americans in the United States|Native American]] tribes, used the meteorite, which they call ''Tomanowos'', in ceremonies and demanded that it be returned and filed an action pursuant to the Native American Graves Protection and Repatriation Act (NAGPRA) against the American Museum of Natural History in 1999. In response, the Museum filed a federal lawsuit seeking a declaratory judgment against the CTGRC in 2000. An agreement with the Museum was reached later that year in which the meteorite would remain at the museum with tribal members being able to conduct a private ceremony around the meteorite once a year, and that ownership will be transferred to CTGRC should the museum cease to have the meteorite on display.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |last=Sullivan |first=John |url=http://partners.nytimes.com/library/national/science/062300sci-meteor-pact.html |title=Pact Leaves Meteorite With Museum |work=[[The New York Times]] |date=June 23, 2000}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In response to a student's request in 2007, [[Oregon House of Representatives|Representative]] [[John Lim]] introduced a resolution that would demand that the museum return the meteorite to Oregon. The tribes said they were not consulted, they did not support the resolution, and were content with the current arrangement with the museum.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last=Walsh | first=Edward | title=Oregon's Pet Rock | url=http://blog.oregonlive.com/politics/2007/03/oregons_pet_rock.html | date=March 26, 2007 | access-date=2010-10-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The {{convert|28|lb|kg|adj=on}} crown section of the meteorite that had been traded to the Macovich Collection for a [[Martian]] meteorite in 1997, was planned to be auctioned in October 2007, which led to claims by the CTGRC of insensitivity.&lt;ref name=NYT&gt;{{cite news |last=Chang |first=Kenneth |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2002/02/14/national/14METE.html |title=Uproar Over a Sliced, and Revered, Meteorite |date=February 14, 2002 |work=[[The New York Times]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.cnn.com/2007/TECH/space/09/14/meteorite.auction.ap/index.html |title=Tribe: Sale of space rock 'insensitive' |work=CNN |date=2007-09-14 |access-date=September 15, 2007 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070914232152/http://www.cnn.com/2007/TECH/space/09/14/meteorite.auction.ap/index.html |archivedate=September 14, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.cnn.com/2007/TECH/space/10/29/meteorite.auction.ap/index.html |title=Cow-killing meteorite sells for $1,554 |work=CNN |date=2007-10-29 |access-date=October 31, 2007 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071030171758/http://www.cnn.com/2007/TECH/space/10/29/meteorite.auction.ap/index.html |archivedate=October 30, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bidders dropped out when an editorial in the Portland ''[[The Oregonian|Oregonian]]'' newspaper asserted the CTGRC would file a lawsuit against the new owner, but the CTGRC disavowed the editorial and said they had no such intent, and that they couldn't stop the sale.

==Mass==
[[Image:Willamette Meteorite Marker.jpg|right|thumb|A historical marker in the Willamette area of [[West Linn, Oregon]].

Marker erected August 4, 1962 by West Linn Fair Board."]]
There is some confusion about the actual mass of the Willamette meteorite due difference between [[tonne|metric tons]] and [[short ton]]s, often both called simply ''tons''. The result is that several sources report different weights, ranging from {{convert|15500|kg}}&lt;ref name=database2&gt;{{metbull|24269|Willamette}}&lt;/ref&gt; to {{convert|12700|kg}}.&lt;ref&gt;Harry Y.

Moreover, in 1906 the American Museum of Natural History stated that the weight of the Willamette meteorite was ''at least 31,200 pounds, or about 15.6 tons''.&lt;ref name=AMJ&gt;The American Museum Journal, American Museum of Natural History, 1906.&lt;/ref&gt; After these considerations it is reasonable to guess that the real weight of the meteorite is about {{convert|14150|kg}}.{{Citation needed|date=August 2008}}{{Original research inline|date=August 2008}}

[[Women]] have served in the [[military]] in various roles and in various jurisdictions throughout history.

Since 1914, in western militaries, women have served in greater numbers and more diverse roles than before.

==History==
===World War I===
{{Main|Women in World War I}}During the [[World War I|First World War]], the United States was in total warfare efforts.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://sq4ya5rf2q.search.serialssolutions.com/?genre=article&amp;isbn=&amp;issn=00028762&amp;title=American%20Historical%20Review&amp;volume=123&amp;issue=4&amp;date=20181001&amp;atitle=Lynn%20Dumenil.%20The%20Second%20Line%20of%20Defense:%20American%20Women%20and%20World%20War%20I;%20Elizabeth%20Cobbs.%20The%20Hello%20Girls:%20America's%20First%20Women%20Soldiers.&amp;aulast=Hendrickson,%20Mark&amp;spage=1332&amp;sid=EBSCO:America:%20History%20&amp;%20Life&amp;pages=1332-1334|title=Journals at the LMU William H. Hannon Library|website=sq4ya5rf2q.search.serialssolutions.com|access-date=2018-11-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Every person had to help in contributing to the war.  However, this doesn't necessarily mean that everyone needed to fight.  The country needed to continue to fund their troops and support the war financially while soldiers were fighting.  The United States relied on organizations to support the war efforts.  Women joined organizations such as the [[Committee on Public Information]] in order to educate people about the war.  This committee additionally promoted nationality.  In addition to working for committees having to do with education, women worked in all sorts of positions.  Many women became [[YWCA USA|YWCA]] members and bravely went overseas to help soldiers.  This was the first time in history that women of all classes were working together to help the war efforts.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://americanhistory.si.edu/collections/object-groups/women-in-wwi|title=Women in World War I|website=National Museum of American History|language=en|access-date=2018-11-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Upper class women founded many voluntary war organizations while middle and lower class women worked in these organizations by working as nurses or by filling in the jobs of men.

Although all women were working to help their country, many women of color faced prejudice during this time.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.oxfordaasc.com/article/opr/t0005/e1286|title=Oxford AASC: Home|website=www.oxfordaasc.com|language=en|access-date=2018-11-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Due to the war effort, many African American families moved from rural farms to urban cities.  African American women were given the most hard working jobs with the lowest pay.  Many organizations were formed, such as the Colored YWCA, to support African American women.  These organizations helped these women find safe homes and stable jobs.  They also hired many social workers to make it certain that employers treated women of color equally.  Towards the end of World War I, black women were legally allowed to travel overseas to help the [[Red Cross]].  Many women from the Association of Colored Graduate Nurses were the first African Americans to help the Red Cross.  Although this is a step in the right direction, the United States still has a long way to reduce prejudice and provide equal rights for African American women and people of color as a whole.  

===Russia===
The only nation to deploy female combat troops in substantial numbers was [[Russia]]. From the onset, female recruits either joined the military in disguise or were tacitly accepted by their units. The most prominent were a contingent of front-line [[light cavalry]] in a [[Cossacks|Cossack]] regiment commanded by a female colonel, [[Alexandra Kudasheva]].

They fought well, but failed to provide the propaganda value expected of them and were disbanded before the end of the year. In the later [[Russian Civil War]], they fought both for the [[Bolsheviks]] (infantry) and the [[White movement|White Guard]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Reese|first=Roger R.|title=The Soviet military experience: a history of the Soviet Army, 1917–1991|publisher=[[Routledge]]|year=2000|page=17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

All the major participating nations in [[World War II]] enlisted women. The majority served as nursing and clerical or support roles. Over 500,000 women had combat roles in anti-aircraft units in Britain and Germany, as well as front-line units in the Soviet Union.

====United Kingdom====
In 1938, the [[British Empire|British]] took the lead in establishing uniformed services for women (small units of nurses had long been in service). In late 1941, Britain began conscripting women, sending most into factories and some into the military, especially the [[Auxiliary Territorial Service]] (ATS) attached to the army. The ATS began as a women's auxiliary in 1938. In 1941, the ATS was granted military status, although women received only [[Gender pay gap|two thirds of male pay]]. Women had a well-publicized role in handling anti-aircraft guns against German planes and [[V-1 flying bomb|V-1 missiles]]. The daughter of Prime Minister [[Winston Churchill]] was there, and he gushed that any general who saved him 40,000 fighting men had gained the equivalent of a victory. By August 1941, women were operating fire-control instruments; although they were never allowed to pull the trigger, since killing the enemy was considered to be too masculine.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first=G. J. |last=DeGroot |title=Whose Finger on the Trigger?

====Germany====
The [[Nazi Germany|Third Reich]] had similar roles for women. The [[Schutzstaffel|SS]]-Helferinnen were regarded as part of the SS if they had undergone training at a Reichsschule SS. All other female workers were contracted to the SS and chosen largely from [[internment|concentration camps]]. Women served in auxiliary units in the navy (Kriegshelferinnen), air force (Luftnachrichtenhelferinnen) and army (Nachrichtenhelferin).&lt;ref name="Gordon Williamson 2003"&gt;Gordon Williamson, ''World War II German Women's Auxiliary Services'' (2003).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Karen Hagemann 2011"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Hagemann | first1 = Karen | year = 2011 | title = Mobilizing Women for War: The History, Historiography, and Memory of German Women's War Service in the Two World Wars | url = | journal = Journal of Military History | volume = 75 | issue = 4| pages = 1055–1094 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1944-45 roughly 500,000 women were volunteer uniformed auxiliaries in the [[Bundeswehr|German armed forces]] (Bundeswehr). About the same number served in civil aerial defense, 400,000 volunteered as nurses and many more replaced drafted men in the wartime economy.&lt;ref name="Karen Hagemann 2011"/&gt; In the [[Luftwaffe]] they served in combat roles helping to operate anti-aircraft systems to shoot down Allied bombers. By 1945, German women held 85% of the billets as clerics, accountants, interpreters, laboratory workers and administrative workers, together with half of the clerical and junior administrative posts in high-level field headquarters.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | first=D'Ann |last=Campbell | title=Women in Combat: The World War Two Experience in the United States, Great Britain, Germany, and the Soviet Union | journal = Journal of Military History | date=April 1993 | volume =57 |pages =301–323 | url = http://americanhistoryprojects.com/downloads/ww2/combat.htm | doi=10.2307/2944060 | issue=2|jstor=2944060 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The German nursing service consisted of four main organizations, one for [[Catholic Church|Catholics]], one for [[Protestantism|Protestants]], the secular DRK (Red Cross) and the "Brown Nurses," for committed [[Nazism|Nazi]] women. Military nursing was primarily handled by the DRK, which came under partial Nazi control. Frontline medical services were provided by male medics and doctors. Red Cross nurses served widely within the military medical services, staffing the hospitals close to the front lines and at risk of attack. Two dozen were awarded the [[Iron Cross]] for heroism under fire.&lt;ref name="Gordon Williamson 2003"/&gt; Brown Nurses were forced to look away while their incapacitated patients were murdered by [[War crime|war criminals]].&lt;ref&gt;Bronwyn Rebekah McFarland-Icke, ''Nurses in Nazi Germany'' (1999)&lt;/ref&gt;

Hundreds of women auxiliaries (Aufseherin) served in the SS in the camps, the majority of which were at [[Ravensbrück]]. 

In Germany women worked and were told by Hitler to produce more pure [[Aryan race|Aryan]] children to fight in future wars.&lt;ref&gt;Leila J. Rupp, ''Mobilizing Women For War: German and American Propaganda, 1939-1945'' (1979)&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Japanese American Women'''

During the second world war, many Japanese American women lost their jobs or pay because they were sent to [[Internment|relocation camps]].  Japanese immigrants and Japanese Americans were faced with discrimination.  Many Americans called it the “yellow peril”&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Smith|first=Susan Lynn|date=1999-12-01|title=Women Health Workers and the Color Line in the Japanese American "Relocation Centers" of World War II|url=https://muse.jhu.edu/article/4392|journal=Bulletin of the History of Medicine|language=en|volume=73|issue=4|pages=585–601|doi=10.1353/bhm.1999.0190|pmid=10615767|issn=1086-3176}}&lt;/ref&gt; and called Japanese people “japs”.  In 1913, California passed the [[California Alien Land Law of 1913|Alien Land Law]] which prohibited “aliens ineligible for citizenship” from owning land to grow crops on.  Despite the discrimination, many Japanese American women volunteered to serve in the [[Women's Army Auxiliary Corps|Women’s Auxiliary Army Corps]].  Sexism along with racism was something that these women faced when they joined WAAC.  Even while dealing with discrimination, Japanese American women were able to greatly help the United States.  Many women were hired as interpreters, translators, and interrogators in the [[Military Intelligence Service (United States)|Military Intelligence Service]].  In 1948, the Women’s Army Corps was permanently established and remained until 1978 when women were allowed into the army.

====Yugoslav Partisans====
 {{main|Women in the Yugoslav Partisans}}
The [[Yugoslav Partisans|Yugoslav National Liberation Movement]] had 6,000,000 civilian supporters; its two million women formed the [[Women's Antifascist Front of Yugoslavia|Antifascist Front of Women]] (AFŽ), in which the revolutionary coexisted with the traditional. The AFŽ managed schools, hospitals and local governments. About 100,000 women served with 600,000 men in [[Josip Broz Tito|Tito's]] [[Yugoslav Partisans|Yugoslav National Liberation Army]]. It stressed its dedication to women's rights and gender equality and used the imagery of folklore heroines to attract and legitimize the fighters.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Jancar | first1 = Barbara | year = 1981 | title = Women in the Yugoslav National Liberation Movement: An Overview | url = | journal = Studies in Comparative Communism | volume = 14 | issue = 2| pages = 143–164 }}&lt;/ref&gt; After the war, although women were relegated to traditional gender roles, Yugoslavia's historians emphasized women's roles in the resistance. After Yugoslavia broke up in the 1990s, women's contributions to the resistance were forgotten.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Drapac | first1 = Vesna | year = 2009 | title = Resistance and the Politics of Daily Life in Hitler's Europe: The Case of Yugoslavia in a Comparative Perspective | url = | journal = Aspasia | volume = 3 | issue = | pages = 55–78 | doi=10.3167/asp.2009.030104}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Barbara Jancar-Webster, ''Women and Revolution in Yugoslavia 1941–1945'' (1990)&lt;/ref&gt;

===Vietnam War===
Though relatively little official data exists about female [[Vietnam War]] veterans, the Vietnam Women’s Memorial Foundation estimates that approximately 11,000 military women were stationed in Vietnam during the conflict. Nearly all of them were volunteers, and 90 percent served as military nurses, though women also worked as physicians, air traffic controllers, intelligence officers, clerks and other positions in the U.S. Women’s Army Corps, U.S. Navy, Air Force and Marines and the Army Medical Specialist Corps. In addition to women in the armed forces, an unknown number of civilian women served in Vietnam on behalf of the Red Cross, United Service Organizations (USO), Catholic Relief Services and other humanitarian organizations, or as foreign correspondents for various news organizations.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/world/2017/09/11/vietnam-war-timeline-u-s-involvement-over-decades/653693001/|title=Vietnam War: A timeline of U.S. entanglement|work=USA TODAY|access-date=2018-11-15|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to the U.S. military women who served in Vietnam, an unknown number of female civilians willingly gave their services on Vietnamese soil during the conflict. Many of them worked on behalf of the [[American Red Cross]], Army Special Services, United Service Organizations (USO), [[Peace Corps]], and various religious groups such as Catholic Relief Services.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.cnn.com/2013/07/01/world/vietnam-war-fast-facts/index.html|title=Vietnam War Fast Facts|last=Library|first=CNN|work=CNN|access-date=2018-11-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other American women traveled to Vietnam as foreign correspondents for news organizations, including Georgette “Dickey” Chappelle, a writer for the National Observer who was killed by a mine while on patrol with U.S. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://linus.lmu.edu/search~S2?/yvietnam+war/yvietnam+war/-3%2C0%2C0%2CB/eresource&amp;FF=ywomen+and+social+movements+in+the+united+states+1600+2000&amp;1%2C1%2C/indexsort=-|title=|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;Marines outside Chu Lai in November 1965. According to the Vietnam Women’s Memorial Foundation, 59 female civilians died during the conflict. 

===Democratic Republic of the Congo===
[[File:Congolese female para-commando 1967.jpg|thumb|200px|A Congolese female para-commando during jump training at capital Leopoldville in 1967]]
The [[Democratic Republic of the Congo]] began training an initial 150 women as para-commandos for the [[Armée Nationale Congolaise]] in 1967. Many more were trained subsequently, over a period of years. The women received parachute and weapons training, although it is unclear to what extent they were actually integrated into the combat units of the Congo. 

===Eritrea===
In 1999, the [[British Broadcasting Corporation|BBC]] reported that about a quarter of the [[Eritrea]]n soldiers in the [[Eritrean–Ethiopian War]] were women.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Eritrea's women fighters|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/special_report/1999/07/99/battle_in_the_horn/396183.stm|website=news.bbc.co.uk|accessdate=17 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2000, the Equality amendment to the Military Service law granted equal opportunities in the military to women found physically and personally suitable for a job. Women started to enter combat support and light combat roles in a few areas, including the Artillery Corps, infantry units and armored divisions. A few platoons named [[Caracal Battalion|Carakal]] were formed for men and women to serve together in light infantry. Many women joined the [[Israeli Border Police|Border Police]].&lt;ref name="feldinger" /&gt;

Despite these changes, fewer than 4 percent of women service members are in combat positions such as infantry, crew of tanks or other armored vehicles, artillery guns service, fighter pilots, etc. Rather, they are concentrated in "combat-support".&lt;ref name="Gaza: It's a Man's War"&gt;[https://www.theatlantic.com/international/archive/2014/08/gaza-a-mans-war-israel-gender/375689/ Gaza: It's a Man's War] The Atlantic, 7 Aug 2014&lt;/ref&gt;

Some nations allow female soldiers to serve in certain combat arms positions. Others exclude them for various reasons including physical demands and privacy policies. Among the NATO nations, and as of the mid-1970s, women were able to attain military status in the following countries: Belgium, Canada, Denmark, France, the Federal Republic of Germany, Greece, the Netherlands, Norway, Portugal, Turkey, the United Kingdom, and the United States. Non-conscription countries, notably the United States, the United Kingdom, and Canada are where the highest levels of female military presences were achieved.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Stanley|first=Sandra Carson|last2=Segal|first2=Mady Wechsler|date=July 1988|title=Military Women in NATO: An Update|url=|journal=Armed Forces &amp; Society|language=en|volume=14|issue=4|pages=559–585|doi=10.1177/0095327x8801400405|issn=0095-327X|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Canada is marked as particularly progressive in its early implementation of gender equality practices.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt183p28m|title=How a Century of War Changed the Lives of Women|last=GERMAN|first=LINDSEY|date=2013|publisher=Pluto Press|isbn=9780745332505}}&lt;/ref&gt; A rise in the call for equal opportunity coupled with the decline of able-bodied men willing to enter military service coaxed countries to reform policies toward female inclusion.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Stanley|first=Sandra Carson|last2=Segal|first2=Mady Wechsler|date=July 1988|title=Military Women in NATO: An Update|url=|journal=Armed Forces &amp; Society|language=en|volume=14|issue=4|pages=559–585|doi=10.1177/0095327x8801400405|issn=0095-327X|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; .

===United States===
The [[United States military]] opens all positions to women.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Army Jobs For Women: Different Positions For Women In The Military - Militaro|url=http://militaro.com/army-jobs-for-women|website=militaro.com|accessdate=7 November 2017|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150329005503/http://militaro.com/army-jobs-for-women|archivedate=29 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Units such as [[United States Special Forces|Special Forces]] require members to meet extraordinary requirements, and no females have met them in some units.

====History====
Women have been involved in the U.S. military since 1775, originally in the civilian fields of nursing, laundering, mending clothing and cooking. 

[[Deborah Sampson]] was one of the first women to enlist while disguised as a man. She was unhappy with her limited role in the [[American Revolution]]. She served in a light infantry unit, fighting in many battles. Injuries put her in a hospital where her secret was discovered. Her commanding officer, General John Paterson, honorably discharged her and thanked her for her service.&lt;ref name="graduate.norwich.edu"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://graduate.norwich.edu/resources-mmh/articles-mmh/how-roles-have-changed-for-women-in-the-military/|title=How Roles Have Changed for Women in the Military {{!}} Norwich Online Graduate Degrees|website=graduate.norwich.edu|language=en-US|access-date=2018-04-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Several hundred women enlisted and fought in the [[US Civil War]], generally disguised as men. In some cases their identity was discovered, typically on the battlefield or in hospitals after becoming wounded.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.civilwar.org/education/history/untold-stories/female-soldiers-in-the-civil.html|title=Female soldiers in the Civil War on the front line|last=Smith|first=Sam|website=www.civilwar.org|accessdate=17 November 2017|date=2013-01-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

In 1917 [[Loretta Walsh]] became the first woman to enlist as a woman. A 1948 law made women a permanent part of the military services. In 1976, the first group of women were admitted into a U.S. military academy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Women in the military|url=http://norfolkdailynews.com/interactive/onlineextras/women-in-the-military/article_a21c355a-d822-11e2-87e3-001a4bcf6878.html|accessdate=2013-10-24|newspaper=Norfolk Daily News|date=8 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Approximately 16% of the 2013 [[United States Military Academy|West Point]] class consisted of women.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Abramson|first1=Larry|title=West Point Women: A Natural Pattern Or A Camouflage Ceiling?|url=https://www.npr.org/2013/10/22/239260015/west-point-women-a-natural-pattern-or-a-camouflage-ceiling|website=NPR.org|accessdate=17 November 2017|language=en|date=22 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1990 and 1991, some 40,000 American military women were deployed during the [[Gulf War]] operations Desert Shield and Desert Storm; however, no women served in combat. A policy enacted in 1994 prohibited women from assignment to ground combat units below the brigade level.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Fischel|first=Justin|title=Military leaders lift ban on women in combat roles|url=http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2013/01/24/panetta-opens-combat-roles-to-women/|accessdate=24 October 2013|newspaper=Fox|date=24 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Policy changes====
Until 1993, 67 percent of the positions in the Army were open to women. 

In 2013, 15.6 percent of the [[United States Army|Army's]] 1.1 million soldiers, including [[Army National Guard|National Guard]] And [[United States Army Reserve|Reserve]], were female, serving in 95 percent of occupations.&lt;ref name="army"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.army.mil/article/110447/Sisters_in_Arms__Breaking_down_barriers_and_rising_to_the_challenge/|title=Sisters in Arms: Breaking down barriers and rising to the challenge|accessdate=24 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; As of 2017 78 percent of the positions{{Clarify|reason=positions vs occupations?

In January 2013, the US ended the policy of "no women in units that are tasked with direct combat".&lt;ref name="armywomen"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.army.mil/article/118930/Army_to_open_33_000_positions_to_female_Soldiers_in_April/|title=Army to open 33,000 positions to female Soldiers in April|author=C.

In 2013 female U.S Army soldiers enrolled in a training course designed by [[Combined Joint Task Force Paladin]], specifically designed for Female Engagement Team members. The course was intended to train female soldiers for tasks such as [[unexploded ordnance]] awareness, [[biometrics]], [[Forensic science|forensics]], evidence collection, tactical questioning, vehicle and personnel searches and homemade explosive devices.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Drohan|first=Ed|title=CJTF Paladin offers training for female engagement team members|url=http://www.army.mil/article/111974/CJTF_Paladin_offers_training_for_Female_Engagement_Team_members/|accessdate=24 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

By May 2015, none of the nineteen women vying to become the first female [[United States Army Rangers|Army Rangers]] had passed [[Ranger School]]. Eleven of the nineteen dropped out in the first four days.

Women have been injured, killed, and awarded high honors. Two women received the [[Silver Star]]: Sgt. Leigh Ann Hester in 2005 and Army Specialist Monica Lin Brown in 2007 for their actions in combat. Over 10,000 combat action badges were awarded to women who served in combat in [[Iraq War|Iraq]] and [[War in Afghanistan (2001–present)|Afghanistan]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.latimes.com/opinion/op-ed/la-oe-1204-lemmon-women-combat-20151204-story.html|title=Women in combat?

The study assessed a nine-month experiment at [[Marine Corps Base Camp Lejeune|Camp Lejeune]], N.C., and [[Twentynine Palms, California|Twentynine Palms]], Calif. About 400 [[Marines]], including 100 women, volunteered to participate.&lt;ref name="washingtonpost.com"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Lamothe|first1=Dan|title=Marine experiment finds women get injured more frequently, shoot less accurately than men|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/checkpoint/wp/2015/09/10/marine-experiment-finds-women-get-injured-more-frequently-shoot-less-accurately-than-men/|accessdate=12 December 2015|work=[[Washington Post]]|date=10 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Male squads, teams and crews demonstrated better performance on 93 of 134 tasks evaluated (69 percent) than units with women in them. Male units were faster while completing tactical movements in [[combat]] situations, especially in units with large "crew-served" weapons such as heavy machine guns and mortars. Male [[infantry]] squads had better accuracy than squads with women in them, with "a notable difference between genders for every individual weapons system" used by infantry rifleman units. The [[M4 carbine]], [[M27 Infantry Automatic Rifle|M27]] infantry automatic rifle and [[M203]] single-shot [[grenade launcher]] were assessed.&lt;ref name="washingtonpost.com"/&gt;

Male [[Marines]] who had not received [[infantry]] training were more accurate than women who had. In removing wounded troops from the battlefield, "notable differences in execution times were found between all-male and gender-integrated groups".&lt;ref name="washingtonpost.com"/&gt;

[[Unit cohesion]] was lower in mixed gender units. Many female soldiers reported that the way that they are viewed by male soldiers is often detrimental to their participation. For instance, female soldiers are often labelled as "either standoffish or a slut".&lt;ref name=doan2017&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Doan|first1=Alesha E.|last2=Portillo|first2=Shannon|title=Not a Woman, but a Soldier: Exploring Identity Through Translocational Positionality|journal=Sex Roles|date=2017|volume= 76|issue=3–4|pages=236–249|doi=10.1007/s11199-016-0661-7|hdl=1808/23881}}&lt;/ref&gt; In order to avoid such labels, female soldiers have to spend time with fellow soldiers strategically, without spending too much time with any one of them. This approach often has an isolating effect.&lt;ref name=doan2017 /&gt; In several instances, women were considered less skilled than male soldiers, so were not given opportunities to complete tasks for which they were qualified.&lt;ref name=doan2017 /&gt; 

According to Lt. Col. Dave Grossman, author of ''On Killing: The Psychological Cost of Learning to Kill in War and Society'', Israeli soldiers reacted with uncontrollable protectiveness and aggression after seeing a woman wounded. Further, Islamic militants rarely, if ever, surrender to female soldiers, lessening the [[Israel Defense Forces|IDF']]&lt;nowiki/&gt;s ability to take prisoners. Iraqi and Afghan civilians are often not intimidated by female soldiers. However, in socially conservative environments, female combat soldiers can search female civilians, while children and women are more likely to talk to female soldiers than to male soldiers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://coalitionforveterans.org/2011/04/female-soldiers-say-theyre-up-for-battle/ |title=Coalition for Iraq &amp; Afghanistan Veterans » Blog Archive » Female soldiers say they're up for battle |publisher=Coalitionforveterans.org |accessdate=16 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Sexual assault: What it is and the Process ====
Sexual assault is more likely to occur in the military than in the civilian population. One in four active-duty female military personnel will be sexually assaulted.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1177/0886260506295347|pmid = 17202575|title = Mental Health, Quality of Life, and Health Functioning in Women Veterans|journal = Journal of Interpersonal Violence|volume = 22|issue = 2|pages = 179–197|year = 2007|last1 = Surìs|first1 = Alina|last2 = Lind|first2 = Lisa|last3 = Kashner|first3 = T. Michael|last4 = Borman|first4 = Patricia D.}}&lt;/ref&gt; The military has a Code Of Justice which defines sexual assault: rape, aggravated assault, abusive sexual assault, nonconsensual sodomy (forced oral or anal sex), or attempts to commit these acts. 

All of these acts are punishable by military law which begins by the victim going forward to their commander. It is then their job to make an inquiry on the perpetrator, however they also have the right to dismiss the claims. They can also the right to take non-judicial punishment or take it to high authority. If the perpetrator's punishment can go from dismissal, to dishonorable discharge to confinement in military prison. If found with the crime of rape the perpetrator can carry a lifetime of imprisonment to in extreme cases even execution.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://military.findlaw.com/criminal-law/military-sexual-assault-the-basics.html|title=Military Sexual Assault: The Basics|work=Findlaw|access-date=2018-11-15|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; When women went to report their sexual assault 83% of the victims stated that their experiences with military legal personnel made them reluctant to seek further help.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Castro|first=Carl Andrew|last2=Kintzle|first2=Sara|last3=Schuyler|first3=Ashley C.|last4=Lucas|first4=Carrie L.|last5=Warner|first5=Christopher H.|date=2015-05-16|title=Sexual Assault in the Military|journal=Current Psychiatry Reports|language=en|volume=17|issue=7|pages=54|doi=10.1007/s11920-015-0596-7|pmid=25980511|issn=1523-3812|citeseerx=10.1.1.640.2867}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Many victims in the military describe the response to and aftermath of sexual assault as more painful than the assault itself because of the unspoken "code of silence." The code of silence implicates that women should keep quiet about their assault and not come forward to take action. Women expect that little will be done, so most cases go unreported. When they are reported and taken to court only ten percent of cases have the perpetrator charged for their crimes, which is a reason women won't come forward as they know little will come from it.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Castro|first=Carl Andrew|last2=Kintzle|first2=Sara|last3=Schuyler|first3=Ashley C.|last4=Lucas|first4=Carrie L.|last5=Warner|first5=Christopher H.|date=2015-05-16|title=Sexual Assault in the Military|journal=Current Psychiatry Reports|language=en|volume=17|issue=7|pages=54|doi=10.1007/s11920-015-0596-7|pmid=25980511|issn=1523-3812|citeseerx=10.1.1.640.2867}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Female soldiers have developed several techniques for avoiding sexual assault "including: (1) relying on support networks [&lt;nowiki/&gt;[[buddy system]]s], (2) capitalizing on their status (associated with rank, age, time spent in military, or prior deployment experience); and, (3) masking femininity through clothing to minimize violence exposure and to keep themselves and others safe during military service".&lt;ref name="cheney2015"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Cheney|first1=Ann M.|last2=Reisinger|first2=Heather Schact|last3=Booth|first3=Brenda M.|last4=Mengeling|first4=Michelle A.|last5=Torner|first5=James C.|last6=Sadler|first6=Anne G.|title=Servicewomen's Strategies to Staying Safe During Military Service|journal=Gender Issues|date=March 2015|volume= 32|issue= 1|pages=1–18|doi=10.1007/s12147-014-9128-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; Such strategies leave the burden of addressing the problem on potential victims.&lt;ref name="cheney2015" /&gt; Conversely, in many units, soldiers pair off as "buddies" who watch out for each other.

==== Effects of sexual Assault ====
Sexual assault leads to many health problems for women in the military such as anxiety disorders, such as post traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), depression, substance abuse, binge eating, dissociation and memory impairment, suicidal and parasuicidal behavior, sexual dysfunction and dissatisfaction, poor self-esteem, and personality disorders, such as borderline personality disorder.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://watermark.silverchair.com/milmed-d-10-00038.pdf?token=AQECAHi208BE49Ooan9kkhW_Ercy7Dm3ZL_9Cf3qfKAc485ysgAAAkIwggI-BgkqhkiG9w0BBwagggIvMIICKwIBADCCAiQGCSqGSIb3DQEHATAeBglghkgBZQMEAS4wEQQMjlJ5fV1_Vgl5BwzzAgEQgIIB9RT5h5Zzgszxdu45nuyLb9quGE9LS6S5lXdoJQYaNA5avXHnG8xQJ_o-ube5T6coQoPQbWTaDR5biO4t9ifKoqfgA13LgM2zKy1mo8KSC_2OgvgyhXy2ZQVngkT04dHG3H98sqEnA6Qk-Aili7qRKJM_nWIcPBw7cBtFmEvebi78s2ZHJbLZ0DGVUpvBvcDnNJ-7qaeH2VEjKDeNgSS-Eaovo0JnjcXr72USJpcym-nz5in--vzrHH09x6dAWk2qdID0W4yh7GKIGmjyZAHjA34vveE7PzfkcUlXLXFoVu5M5QcjfheteaQwhmX1102VO1_YsdH6bRt1LqFLBfKaUkxA4-YLBai2frbT6v9LDn1EnKNgrpOxwsf4PFJXUCiaBK19WhzfE50IBuoqQopn1VbjYaHNNFqaiAaHbS3YXkZVzXZCtlcVGBdgBm1gqtRI4DRTZSqD8pU4NLwM5y6p4mRQkU8yyq1hkW1rspXdmwnIEzigVoaLps63IiN3UX8XsF1WzOpDotOqhcl1LZ8jjllNdlFQS-EkU72QONZZsWyBCL-8b0QS5c7GzObIxDQfQYpuvM6sxtIpGr40pmaJa8lhtTFKp4t-plDBL6OE1UcmZD3KRfRIAMuJ_CfI9AiVf4zG9CeAAHnhgzjcS1djVEUig79ihAWomen|title=|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; It also takes a toll on their physical health and have reported having menstrual complications, headaches, back pain, gastrointestinal pain.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title=SAGE Journals: Your gateway to world-class journal research|journal=Journal of Interpersonal Violence|volume=22|issue=2|pages=179–197|url=https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1177/0886260506295347.|language=en|doi=10.1177/0886260506295347|pmid=17202575|year=2007|last1=Surìs|first1=Alina|last2=Lind|first2=Lisa|last3=Kashner|first3=T.

All of these factors make it hard for women to stay in the military, in women it is the leading cause for early leave of the armed forces. Once leaving the military though women have a hard time reintegrating back into society and can end up homeless. It is so debilitating for women in the military because most of their perpetrates are people they work and live with, from peers to a supervisor and higher above. This close relationship creates a new type of trauma as the victim is forced to see them every day and creates an overall lack of trust in people&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title=Sexual Assault in the Military|journal=Current Psychiatry Reports|volume=17|issue=7|pages=54|doi=10.1007/s11920-015-0596-7|pmid=25980511|year = 2015|last1 = Castro|first1 = Carl Andrew|last2=Kintzle|first2=Sara|last3=Schuyler|first3=Ashley C.|last4=Lucas|first4=Carrie L.|last5=Warner|first5=Christopher H.|citeseerx=10.1.1.640.2867}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

Updated military training focuses on bystander interventions and the role of [[consent]] in sexual activity, emphasizing the responsibility of male soldiers.&lt;ref name="weitz2015" /&gt; Some female soldiers assume the classically male role of "protector". This works to change women's "responsibility for preventing rape"&lt;ref name="weitz2015" /&gt; and requires that male soldiers acknowledge their responsibility to engage with female soldiers in all activities.

[[File:Military parade on Red Square 2017-05-09 028.jpg|thumb|Russian female cadets.]]
A 2008 study found that female cadets saw military training as an "opportunity to be strong, assertive and skillful" and saw such training "as an escape from some of the negative aspects of traditional femininity". The female cadets also believed that the ROTC program was "gender-blind" and "gender-neutral". The study claims that female cadets "were hyper-vigilant about their status as women performing tasks traditionally seen as men's work and often felt that they had to constantly prove they were capable."&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

The study quoted one female cadet: "in the Navy the joke is that a woman in the Navy is either a bitch, a slut or a lesbian, and ''none of them are good categories to fall into'', and if you are stern with your people then you are a bitch, but if you're a guy and stern people are like, wow, I respect him for being a good leader."&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

84 percent of cadets said they did not want a military career as it would interfere with marriage and raising children.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite journal | author = Jennifer M.

A 2009 study examined the attitudes of West Point cadets, [[Reserve Officer Training Corps]] (ROTC) cadets, and non-military-affiliated students from civilian colleges toward a variety of military roles.
