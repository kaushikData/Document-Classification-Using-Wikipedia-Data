'''Agustí Montal i Galobart''' was a president of the [[FC Barcelona]] for the years 1946 to 1952. Born in [[Barcelona]] in 1906 and died in 1964.

After the [[Spanish Civil War]] and during the early years of the [[Dictatorship]] by [[Francisco Franco]], between 1939 and 1953, the president was appointed by the authorities of the regime. Montal's presidency began on 20 September 1946.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url= http://www.blaugranas.com/agustin_montal_i_galobart-itemap-118-2980-1.htm | title= blaugranas.com | accessdate= April 11, 2010 | archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20150703190925/http://www.blaugranas.com/agustin_montal_i_galobart-itemap-118-2980-1.htm | archive-date= 2015-07-03 | dead-url= yes | df=  }}&lt;/ref&gt; But success came only in 1952, when the team under the command of [[Ferdinand Daucik]] during a season won five titles - La Liga, the Spanish Cup, Copa America, the [[Trofeo Martini Rossi]] and the [[Copa Eva Duarte]]. This resulted in a significant increase in the Barca fans, so he decided to buy land to build a new stadium - the [[Camp Nou]], since Les Corts was too small to accommodate a growing group of followers. On 16 July 1952 Montal resigned as chairman to be replaced by [[Enric Martí Carreto]].

His son [[Agustí Montal i Costa]] was also chairman of the 1966 Barcelona 1977.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.elperiodico.com/default.asp?idpublicacio_PK=46&amp;idioma=CAS&amp;idtipusrecurs_PK=7&amp;idnoticia_PK=343728| title = elperiodico.com | accessdate= April 11, 2010 }} {{Dead link|date=October 2010|bot=H3llBot}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Amir Reko''' (born 1963), known by his ''[[nom de guerre]]'' '''Makedonac''' ("the Macedonian"), is a [[Bosnia and Herzegovina|Bosnian]]-[[Denmark|Danish]] entrepreneur, formerly military officer in the [[Yugoslav People's Army]] (JNA), and a commander in the [[Army of the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina]] (ARBiH) during the [[Bosnian War]] (1992–1995).

An ethnic [[Bosniak]], Reko was born in the hamlet of Gudelj of the village [[Jošanica, Foča|Jošanica]] in [[Foča]] in eastern Bosnia.{{sfn|Ličnosti}} During [[World War II in Yugoslavia|World War II]] his grandmother was saved by a [[Serbs|Serb]].{{sfn|DW 2017}} He finished primary school in the village of [[Ustikolina]], after which he moved to [[Sarajevo]] on higher studies, finishing middle technical school in 1982.{{sfn|Ličnosti}} He finished the Army military school in 1986 as an infantry.{{sfn|Ličnosti}} He served as an officer (''časnik'') in [[Novo Mesto]] (in Slovenia), [[Gospić]] (Croatia), [[Pljevlja]] (Montenegro), [[Bitola]] (Macedonia), [[Zaječar]] (Serbia).{{sfn|Ličnosti}}

Reko deserted from the JNA in April 1992.{{sfn|DW 2017}} While wanting to preserve "[[Brotherhood and Unity]]", the real situation, when the war spilled over into Bosnia and his home village, forced him to leave the JNA.{{sfn|B92 2017}} He had received information that Serb forces occupied Foča and his village.{{sfn|B92 2017}} He contacted his ethnic Serb friend and JNA colleague Dragan Simić stationed in [[Niš]], and told him that he was to leave to be with his family.{{sfn|B92 2017}} Simić offered to help, and the two went for Bosnia.{{sfn|B92 2017}} They crossed Serb-held territory into Bosniak-held territory in [[Goražde]] where Reko believed his family took refuge.{{sfn|DW 2017}} His colleague saved him from Bosnian Serb policemen at [[Ustiprača]].{{sfn|DW 2017}}

Reko became the first commander of the 43rd Drina Assault Brigade ({{lang|bs|43. Drinska udarna brigada}}) of ARBiH, based in Goražde.{{sfn|DW 2017}} His high rank came as the result of his Military Academy diploma.{{sfn|DW 2017}} His ''nom de guerre'' became ''Makedonac'' due to his years of service in Bitola.{{sfn|DW 2017}} He was unable to meet up with his family in Gudelj, as that village was under [[Army of Republika Srpska]] (VRS) control.{{sfn|DW 2017}} Serb soldiers killed his mother Aziza and grandfather (along with five other family members{{sfn|B92 2017}}) while [[ethnic cleansing|cleansing]] the village of the remaining people, through setting a house which held them on fire.{{sfn|DW 2017}} Reko has stated that he knows of the perpetrators, and that one lives in Canada.{{sfn|B92 2017}} A few days after, the Municipal headquarters of the Territorial Defense ordered that the Serb village of Bučje be cleansed as it posed a threat due to VRS progress.{{sfn|DW 2017}} While an ideal chance for revenge, Reko refused, and was called weak and a traitor.{{sfn|DW 2017}} He organized talks with the Bučje inhabitants for the peaceful surrender of them and their weapons.{{sfn|DW 2017}} As a result, the village's 45 Serbs and few Bosniaks were saved.{{sfn|DW 2017}} Reko learnt that he was an assassination target due to saving Serbs, and that orders came from people currently in the Bosnian government.{{sfn|B92 2017}} After the war he set up a memorial to the killed members of his family.{{sfn|DW 2017}}

After the war, he moved to [[Denmark]].{{sfn|Ličnosti}} He became a successful businessman,{{sfn|DW 2017}} and established a family, with two children.{{sfn|B92 2017}} He and his wife eventually divorced.{{sfn|B92 2017}} In 2008, he met with his childhood romance Azra in Bosnia, who was a widow with two children.{{sfn|B92 2017}} They eventually married.{{sfn|B92 2017}}

He owns a Danish-Bosnian company "Bohen" that produces gaskets, parts of rubber and plastic and parts for water and heating.{{sfn|Ličnosti}} He currently lives in Denmark with his family.{{sfn|Ličnosti}} Reko established the political movement "Most 21", aimed at a multi-ethnic unitary state.{{sfn|B92 2017}}

A documentary on his life was made in 2016, called ''Makedonac''.{{sfn|DW 2017}} There is plans of a movie.{{sfn|DW 2017}} He has been interviewed by various newspapers and guested TV shows such as [[RTRS]]'s ''Telering'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=RTRS - TELERING 05.7.2017.|publisher=RTRS (via YouTube)|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wDs63ZCNY2M}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Prva Srpska Televizija|Prva]]'s ''Život Priča'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Život priča - Čov(J)ek|publisher=PRVA (via YouTube)|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QxUyzPCk4f4}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Face TV (Bosnia and Herzegovina)|Face]]'s ''Face to Face'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Amir Reko, kapetan koji je spasio 52 Srba: "Tri dana prije ubili su sve moje, ja nisam htio..."|publisher=FACE HD TV (via YouTube)|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fggXjIv5aQc}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Happy TV]]'s ''Jutarnji program'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Amir Reko, heroj koji je spasio 45 civila od smrti - Dobro jutro Srbijo - (TV Happy 11.12.2017)|publisher=Jutarnji Program TV HAPPY (via YouTube)|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=osz2uC_ZiOw}}&lt;/ref&gt; Elta's ''Razgovor'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=RAZGOVOR AMIR REKO I DRAGAN SIMIC|publisher=Elta HD (via YouTube)|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ni4J95eMJAs}}&lt;/ref&gt; OSMTV's ''Lice Nacije''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=LICE NACIJE OSMTV, gosti Amir Reko i Olivera Markovic 22 11 2017|publisher=OSM Televizija (via YouTube)|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CYOVhEyhr7g}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Personal life==
Mara was born '''Ann Maria Teresa Mumm''' in [[Manhattan]], [[New York City]], the daughter of Olive ([[née]] DuBord) and George Mumm. She was of German, French-Canadian, and Irish ancestry.&lt;ref&gt;{{IMDb name|id=0544718|name=Kate Mara|section=bio}}&lt;/ref&gt; She married Wellington Mara (1916–2005) in 1954 and had eleven children.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://familysearch.org/pal:/MM9.1.1/X42R-3KG|title=Person Details for Anne Mumm in household of George Mumm, "United States Census, 1930" — FamilySearch.org|work=familysearch.org|accessdate=February 1, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sportsmedia101.com/newyorkgiants/2012/07/14/new-york-giants-ann-mara-last-of-a-dying-breed/|title=New York Giants' Ann Mara: Last of a Dying Breed|work=Giants 101|accessdate=February 1, 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150924121910/http://www.sportsmedia101.com/newyorkgiants/2012/07/14/new-york-giants-ann-mara-last-of-a-dying-breed/|archive-date=2015-09-24|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ann Mumm met [[Wellington Mara]] by chance when a woman fainted at a 7:30&amp;nbsp;a.m. Mass that they both regularly attended. Both Ann and Wellington rushed to her side to help. Three of their early dates took place at Yankee Stadium, Madison Square Garden, and the Fordham gymnasium. After that Ann and Wellington were married, in 1954. They took their honeymoon in Southern California. Ann and Wellington had 11 children (7 girls and 4 boys) and 42 grandchildren.

==Media attention==
Mara was an active member of the Giants community. In 2012 she gained media attention after having an argument with [[Terry Bradshaw]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.playerwives.com/nfl/new-york-giants/wellington-maras-wife-and-john-maras-mother-ann-mara/|title=Wellington Mara's Wife and John Mara's Mother, Ann Mara - PlayerWives.com|work=playerwives.com|accessdate=February 1, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nydailynews.com/sports/football/giants/examining-mara-family-tree-ny-giants-seek-fourth-super-bowl-patriots-article-1.1016405|title=Climbing our way through the Mara family tree|work=NY Daily News|accessdate=February 1, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Death==
Mara was in good health until she fell on ice when she was fetching her newspaper outside of her [[Harrison, New York|Harrison]] home. Mara's housekeeper usually went to get the paper but on that day Mara went to get it herself. She died from pneumonia two weeks after her fall, on February 1, 2015. She was 85 years old.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.giants.com/news-and-blogs/article-1/Ann-Mara-New-York-Giants-Matriarch-1929-2015/f063afb1-4f6a-4621-94fb-cbe2e17f3ea2|title=Ann Mara, New York Giants' Matriarch,  1929-2015|work=giants.com|accessdate=February 1, 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150201201416/http://www.giants.com/news-and-blogs/article-1/Ann-Mara-New-York-Giants-Matriarch-1929-2015/f063afb1-4f6a-4621-94fb-cbe2e17f3ea2|archive-date=2015-02-01|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; She was remembered with a moment of silence during [[Super Bowl XLIX]]; also, the Giants wore a patch on the right side of their uniforms, near the shoulders during the following season in her memory, with the letters "ATM" in black on a white circle background.

In 1851, local government was inaugurated in Auckland with the establishment of the Borough of Auckland. Clark was elected as the inaugural and only mayor of the borough council, serving in 1851–1852. However the legality of Auckland's elevation as a Borough was legally contested and overturned. Auckland was placed under the care of a Board of Governors, whose Chairman was Archibald Clark. He was succeeded by [[Walter Lee (New Zealand politician)|Walter Lee]], who was chairman in 1852–1854. It was not until 1871, that Auckland was formally incorporated and [[Philip Philips]] was elected as the first mayor of the city council (by the other city councillors and not by popular vote).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=History of Auckland City |url=http://www.aucklandcity.govt.nz/auckland/introduction/bush/mayors.asp |publisher=Auckland Council |accessdate=17 September 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110927130614/http://www.aucklandcity.govt.nz/auckland/introduction/bush/mayors.asp |archivedate=27 September 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Auckland mayors |url=http://www.aucklandcitylibraries.com/populartopics/resourcepages/localhistory/Auckland-mayors.aspx |archive-url=https://archive.is/20120728160838/http://www.aucklandcitylibraries.com/populartopics/resourcepages/localhistory/Auckland-mayors.aspx |dead-url=yes |archive-date=28 July 2012 |publisher=Auckland City Libraries |accessdate=17 September 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Conservatorship''' is a legal concept in the [[United States]]. A guardian or a protector is appointed by a judge to manage the financial affairs and/or daily life of another due to physical or mental limitations, or old age.&lt;ref name="al"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Larson|first1=Aaron|title=What is a Conservatorship|url=https://www.expertlaw.com/library/estate_planning/conservatorship.html|website=ExpertLaw.com|accessdate=20 December 2017|date=20 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; A person under conservatorship is a "conservatee," a term that can refer to an adult. A person under guardianship is a "ward," a term that can also refer to a minor child.

The '''conservator''' may be only of the "estate" (financial affairs), but may be also of the "person," wherein the conservator takes charge of overseeing the daily activities, such as health care or living arrangements of the '''conservatee'''. A conservator of the person is more typically called a [[legal guardian]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Lawbytes|url=http://www.selegal.org/conservatorships.htm|website=Southeast Tennessee Legal Services|accessdate=20 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Appointment==
Conservatorship is established either by [[court order]] (with regard to individuals) or via a statutory or regulatory authority (with regard to organizations such as business entities). In other legal terms, a conservatorship may refer to the legal responsibilities over a person who is [[mentally disordered]], including individuals who are [[psychotic]], [[suicidal]], demented, incapacitated, or in some other way unable to make legal, medical or financial decisions on behalf of themselves.&lt;ref name="huffingtonpost"&gt;{{Cite news |last=Baxter |first=Lawrence |last2=Brown |first2=Bill |last3=Cox |first3=Jim |title=Finally, A Bridge to Somewhere |newspaper=Huffington Post |date=February 27, 2009 |url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/lawrence-baxter-bill-brown-and-james-cox/finally-a-bridge-to-somew_b_170688.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When referring to government control of private corporations such as [[Freddie Mac]] or [[Fannie Mae]], conservatorship implies a more temporary control than does [[nationalization]].

==Conservatorship of persons==
Conservatorship is a legal term referring to the legal responsibilities of a conservator over the affairs of a person who has been deemed [[gravely disabled]] by the court and unable to meet his or her basic needs of food, clothing, and shelter. They are governed by the state's individual laws. Terminology varies, and some states or jurisdictions may refer to a conservator as a guardian of the estate or as a trustee.

Conservatorships are generally put in place for severely mentally ill individuals who are gravely disabled, elderly individuals with dementia or Alzheimer's disease who lack mental capacity, or individuals with developmental disabilities who may or may not lack mental capacity. Mental capacity normally must to be evaluated by a medical physician or a psychiatrist experienced in the field and is documented and provided to the court as evidence.&lt;ref name="al"/&gt;

In the state of California there are two types of conservatorships: Lanterman–Petris–Short ([[Lanterman–Petris–Short Act]] of 1967, referred to as LPS) and Probate conservatorships.  These forms of conservatorship are governed by the California Probate Code, and Welfare and Institutions Codes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=How are Lanterman-Petris-Short (LPS) and Probate conservatorships different?|url=http://www.lacourt.org/division/probate/PR0019.aspx|website=Superior Court of California, County of Los Angeles|accessdate=20 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Limited conservatorship===
A "limited conservatorship" usually refers to the limited legal responsibilities of a conservator over the affairs of an individual who is developmentally disabled, but still capable of making important decisions for himself or herself.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Limited Conservatorship|url=http://www.scscourt.org/self_help/probate/conservatorship/conservatorship_limited.shtml|website=Superior Court of California, County of Alameda|accessdate=20 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In these cases, the conservatee to whom the limited conservatorship applies can retain more control over his or her personal affairs than other conservatees can; for example, he or she may retain his or her right to decide where he or she may live.

An example of a conservator's duties includes: locating and marshalling assets, such as property and money, which belong to the conservatee; using the assets to buy food for the conservatee, secure and pay for placement in a facility which would take care of the conservatee or treat a mental illness, pay bills for the conservatee, manage property by paying for property insurance, mortgage payments or rent, property clean-up, or pay for a property management company to rent the property. An example of a conservator or guardian's medical responsibilities would be the court granting medical authority to the conservator or guardian, and the conservator or guardian authorizing a physician to place a feeding tube to provide nourishment into the protected person's stomach if they are in medical need of it.  It is not uncommon for one person to hold both offices and be referred to as the "guardian and conservator" of the conservatee, even though a conservator or guardian can be appointed over the person only, the estate only, or both. Generally, a conservator or guardian over the estate is only appointed if the conservatee has assets that need to be protected, marshalled, and managed. These terms may be found in use in U.P.C. jurisdictions, even though the U.P.C. uses the term "protected person" in either case.

In most states, an outside party or agency must review the facts of the case and submit a report, usually required to be in writing, to the court before the court makes a decision on the request to establish a conservatorship or guardianship. Usually the outside party is a local County Mental Health representative called an investigator. They are often required to be experts in some appropriate field, such as social work, mental health, a medical field, or law. Procedures for conservatorship of an adult are often different from those for minors. 

The court may appoint an attorney to represent the proposed conservatee or ward. If the proposed conservatee or ward is unable to have an attorney-client relationship because of some impairment, the court may appoint a guardian-ad-litem (who is often also an attorney). A guardian-ad-litem does not take instruction from the client, but rather acts on their behalf and tells the court what they think is in the best interests of the proposed conservatee or ward, whether or not that is what the proposed conservatee or ward wants. The conservatee has the right to be represented by an attorney, and if they cannot afford a private attorney, they are appointed a public defender that will represent them free of cost.

====California====
LPS conservatorships begin with a temporary 30-day conservatorship, and if the conservatee remains gravely disabled, the conservator is reappointed for a year; the LPS conservatorship can be renewed annually, or terminated if no longer needed. Probate conservatorships are referred to as "general conservatorships", and typically do not have a temporary period unless an urgent emergency exists that is creating risk to the person or their estate. Probate conservatorship do not automatically expire as LPS conservatorships do if they are not renewed by the conservator.

In an LPS conservatorship, a court-appointed conservator over the person is responsible for managing the conservatee's placement, medical decisions, and mental health treatment. A conservator over the estate is responsible for marshalling, protecting, and managing the conservatee's assets that remain in their estate. A conservator reports to the court that appointed them, and is monitored by the supervising judicial court in the county in which the conservatee permanently resides.

LPS conservatorships usually begin in the County Mental Health system and are referred from acute psychiatric hospitals, where Probate conservatorships can result from any referral source if validated with property medical documentation. Mental Health consumers have the right to a Patient's Rights advocate, and are taken through a series of hearings while they are in the acute hospital before they reach the point of needing a conservator.

==Conservatorship of organizations==
{{expert needed|Business|section|ex2=Law|date=February 2009}}
In the United States, in some states, corporations can be placed under conservatorship, as a less extreme alternative to [[receivership]].  Whereas a receiver is expected to terminate the rights of shareholders and managers, a conservator is expected merely to assume those rights,  with the prospect that they will be relinquished.&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite book |title=Preventing Financial Chaos: An International Guide to Legal Rules and Operating Procedures for Handling Insolvent Banks |isbn=90-411-8848-7 |page=32 |first=Robert Lee |last=Ramsey |author2=John W. Head |year=2000 |publisher=[[Kluwer]] |location=}}
&lt;/ref&gt;
Robert Ramsey &amp; John Head, law professors who specialize in financial issues, suggest that an [[insolvent]] bank should go into receivership rather than conservatorship to guard against false hope and [[moral hazard]].&lt;ref&gt;
Ramsey &amp; Head (2000), p.37
&lt;/ref&gt;

At the federal government level in the United States, in July 2008, the failing [[IndyMac Bank]] was taken into [[administrative receivership]] by the [[Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation]] (FDIC) and its assets and secured liabilities transferred to a specially established [[Bridge bank (United States)|bridge bank]] called [[IndyMac Federal Bank, FSB]] which was placed into conservatorship, also by the FDIC.

Again, in the U.S. at the federal level, in September 2008, the chief executive officers, and board of directors [[Fannie Mae]] and [[Freddie Mac]] were dismissed,  and the companies were placed into the conservatorship of the [[Federal Housing Finance Agency]] (FHFA) via the determination of its director [[James B. Lockhart III]], with the support and financial backing of U.S. Treasury via Treasury secretary [[Hank Paulson]]'s commitment to keep the corporations solvent.&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;
The intervention leading to the conservatorship of these two entities has become the largest in government history, and was justified as necessary step to prevent the damage to the financial system that would have been caused by their failure. Entities like this are considered [[too big to fail]].&lt;ref name='Treasury-Paulson-2008-09-07'&gt;

An even more ambitious use of the conservatorship model has been proposed by Duke professors Lawrence Baxter, Bill Brown and Jim Cox.  They suggest that the troubled U.S. banks be placed in conservatorship, that some of their "good assets" be dropped into newly created "good bank" subsidiaries (presumably under new management), and the remaining "bad assets" be left to be managed under the supervision of a conservatorship structure.&lt;ref name="huffingtonpost" /&gt;

'''Copyfraud''' refers to false [[copyright]] claims by individuals or institutions with respect to content that is in the [[public domain]]. Such claims are wrongful, at least under U.S. and Australian copyright law, because material that is not copyrighted is free for all to use, modify and reproduce. Copyfraud also includes overreaching claims by publishers, museums and others, as where a legitimate copyright owner knowingly, or with [[Knowledge (legal construct)#Constructive knowledge|constructive knowledge]], claims rights beyond what the law allows.  

The term "copyfraud" was coined by [[Jason Mazzone]], a Professor of Law at the [[University of Illinois at Urbana–Champaign|University of Illinois]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.law.illinois.edu/faculty/profile/jasonmazzone "Jason Mazzone, Professor, Lynn H.

"Too Quick to Copyright", ''Legal Times'', volume 26, no. 46&lt;/ref&gt; Other legal scholars have suggested public and private remedies, and a few cases have been brought involving copyfraud.

==Definition==
Mazzone describes copyfraud as:
* Claiming copyright ownership of [[public domain]] material.&lt;ref name=Copyfraud-NYULR/&gt;{{rp|1038}}
* Imposition by a copyright owner of restrictions beyond what the law allows.&lt;ref name=Copyfraud-NYULR/&gt;{{rp|1047}}
* Claiming copyright ownership on the basis of ownership of copies or archives.&lt;ref name=Copyfraud-NYULR/&gt;{{rp|1052}}
* Attaching [[copyright notice]]s to a public domain work converted to a different medium.&lt;ref name=Copyfraud-NYULR/&gt;{{rp|1044–45}}

==Analysis==
Mazzone argues that copyfraud is usually successful because there are few and weak laws [[criminalization|criminalizing]] [[false statement]]s about copyrights, lax enforcement of such laws, few people who are competent to give [[legal advice]] on the copyright status of commandeered material, and few people willing to risk a lawsuit to resist the fraudulent licensing fees:
{{quote|Copyright law itself creates strong incentives for copyfraud. The Copyright Act provides for no civil penalty for falsely claiming ownership of public domain materials. There is also no remedy under the Act for individuals who wrongly refrain from legal copying or who make payment for permission to copy something they are in fact entitled to use for free. While falsely claiming copyright is technically a criminal offense under the Act, prosecutions are extremely rare. These circumstances have produced fraud on an untold scale, with millions of works in the public domain deemed copyrighted, and countless dollars paid out every year in licensing fees to make copies that could be made for free. Copyfraud stifles valid forms of reproduction and undermines free speech.&lt;ref name=Copyfraud-NYULR/&gt;}}

Mazzone continues: "[C]opyfraud upsets the constitutional balance and undermines First Amendment values", chilling free expression and stifling creativity.&lt;ref name=Copyfraud-NYULR/&gt;{{rp|1029–30}}

In the U.S. Copyright Act, only two sections deal with improper assertions of copyright on public domain materials: Section 506(c) criminalizes fraudulent uses of copyright notices, and Section 506(e) punishes knowingly making a false representation of a material fact in the application for copyright registration.&lt;ref name=Copyfraud-NYULR/&gt;{{rp|1036}} Section 512(f) additionally punishes using the [[Online Copyright Infringement Liability Limitation Act|safe harbor]] provisions of the [[Digital Millennium Copyright Act]] to remove material the issuer knows is not infringing. But the U.S. Copyright Act does not expressly provide for any civil actions to remedy claims of copyright on public domain materials, nor does the Act prescribe relief for individuals who refrain from copying or pay for copying permission to an entity that engages in copyfraud.&lt;ref name=Copyfraud-NYULR/&gt;{{rp|1030}} Professor [[Peter Suber]] argued in a 2011 article that the United States should "make the penalties for copyfraud (false claim of copyright) at least as severe as the penalties for infringement; that is, take the wrongful decrease in the circulation of ideas at least as seriously as the wrongful increase in the circulation of ideas."&lt;ref&gt;Suber, Peter.

Section 202 of the [[Australian Copyright Act 1968]], which imposes penalties for "groundless threats of legal proceedings", provides a cause of action in that country for any false claims of copyright infringement. This includes false claims of copyright ownership of public domain material, or claims to impose copyright restrictions beyond those permitted by the law.

American legal scholar [[Paul J. Heald]], in a 1993 paper published in the ''Journal of Intellectual Property Law'', explored the possibility that payment demands for spurious copyrights might be resisted in civil lawsuits under a number of commerce-law theories: (1) Breach of warranty of title; (2) unjust enrichment; (3) fraud; and (4) false advertising.&lt;ref&gt;Heald, Paul J. [http://digitalcommons.law.uga.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1341&amp;context=fac_artchop "Payment Demands for Spurious Copyrights: Four Causes of Action"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160528080756/http://digitalcommons.law.uga.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1341&amp;context=fac_artchop |date=2016-05-28 }}, ''Journal of Intellectual Property Law'', vol. 1, 1993–1994, p. 259&lt;/ref&gt; Heald cited a case in which the first of these theories was used successfully in a copyright context: ''Tams-Witmark Music Library v. New Opera Company''.&lt;ref&gt;''Tams-Witmark Music Library v. New Opera Company'', 81 N.E. 2d 70 (NY 1948)&lt;/ref&gt; In this case&lt;blockquote&gt;[A]n opera company purchased the right to perform the opera ''[[The Merry Widow]]'' for $50,000 a year.  After a little more than a year of performances, the company discovered that the work had passed into the public domain several years before due to a failure on the part of the copyright holder to renew the copyright.  It ceased paying royalties, and after being sued by the owner of the abandoned copyright, counterclaimed for damages in the amount paid to the owner on a breach of warranty/failure of consideration theory.  The trial court awarded the opera company $50,500 in damages, and the court of appeals affirmed the judgement, finding that ''The Merry Widow'' "passed, finally, completely and forever into the public domain and became freely available to the unrestricted use of anyone. ... New Opera's pleas of breach of warranty and total failure of consideration were established, and by undisputed proof."&lt;/blockquote&gt;

[[Cory Doctorow]], in a 2014 ''[[Boing Boing]]'' article, noted the "widespread practice of putting restrictions on scanned copies of public domain books online" and the many "powerful entities who lobby online services for a shoot now/ask questions later approach to copyright takedowns, while the victims of the fraud have no powerful voice advocating for them."&lt;ref&gt;Doctorow, Cory.

They commented that "[m]useums claim they create a new copyright when making a faithful reproduction of a 2D artwork by photography or scanning, but it is doubtful that the law supports this". They argued that the fees inhibit the dissemination of knowledge, the very purpose of public museums and galleries, and so "pose a serious threat to art history". Therefore, they advised the UK's national museums "to follow the example of a growing number of international museums (such as the Netherlands' [[Rijksmuseum]]) and provide open access to images of publicly owned, out-of-copyright paintings, prints and drawings so that they are free for the public to reproduce".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Bendor ''et al.''|last=Grosvenor |author-link=Bendor Grosvenor |title=Museums' fees for image reproduction |newspaper=[[The Times]] |date=November 6, 2017 |page=34}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Dominic Lee Tsz-king''' ({{zh-t|李梓敬}}; 22 January 1984) is a [[Liberal Party (Hong Kong)|Liberal Party]] politician in Hong Kong. He is a member of the [[Sham Shui Po District Council]] for [[Yau Yat Tsuen (constituency)|Yau Yat Tsuen]] and the former chairman of the Liberal Party Youth Committee.

==Biography==
Lee was born in Hong Kong in 1984 to an upper-middle-class family. He was educated at the [[Diocesan Boys' School]] and the [[Li Po Chun United World College of Hong Kong]] and graduated from the [[Rice University]] in the United States in 2006 with a degree in economics. He working as an assistant in his campus polling station for the [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic Party]] presidential candidate [[John Kerry]] in 2004 and later worked as an intern for Democrat member of the [[US House of Representatives]] [[Al Green (politician)|Al Green]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://nextplus.nextmedia.com/news/nextlife/20160222/357932|title=【林‧作人】堅守政治理念的李梓敬（林作）|work=Next Plus|date=22 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He joined the pro-business conservative [[Liberal Party (Hong Kong)|Liberal Party]] in 2009 after he returned to Hong Kong. Before that he had helped the party chairman [[James Tien (politician)|James Tien]] running in [[New Territories East (constituency)|New Territories East]] in 2004. He became the first chairman of the party's youth committee when it was established in 2011.

Lee is vocal for his conservative stances on economy, immigration and social issues. He is known for his strong words in opposition to universal retirement protection and was once sworn by an old lady even over the topic during a [[Legislative Council of Hong Kong|legislative council]] public hearing, which immediately went viral on the Internet.

In 2015, he supported the government's plan to scrap visa-free facility for Indians, defending the move as a "sacrifice to protect our borders".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=

}}&lt;/ref&gt; In May, he led an anti-refugee protest which drew 100 to 200 people as well as counter-protest.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=HKFP Lens: ‘Gas them’ – Activists satirise anti-refugee campaigners at competing rallies|date=9 May 2016|work=Hong Kong Free Press|url=https://www.hongkongfp.com/2016/05/09/hkfp-lens-gas-them-activists-satirise-anti-refugee-campaigners-at-competing-rallies/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In April 2016, he led a protest in [[Lan Kwai Fong]] are hitting back against the [[Equal Opportunities Commission (Hong Kong)|Equal Opportunities Commission]]'s ruling of "ladies' night" being discriminatory.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title= Party people move for ladies' night|first=Kenneth|last=Lau|date=19 April 2016|newspaper=The Standard|url=http://www.thestandard.com.hk/section-news.php?id=168405}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[Hong Kong local elections, 2011|2011 District Council elections]], Lee ran in Shek Lei Extension but was defeated by [[Democratic Party (Hong Kong)|Democratic Party]] incumbent Leung Kwok-wah. In the [[Hong Kong local elections, 2015|2015 District Council elections]], he run for a safer constituency [[Yau Yat Tsuen (constituency)|Yau Yat Tsuen]] where he lives, and won against [[League of Social Democrats]] candidate Dickson Chau Ka-faat, succeeding council chairman Jimmy Kwok Chun-wah as member of the [[Sham Shui Po District Council]].

'''Engineering College Magazines Associated''' (more commonly abbreviated as ECMA) is a group of student run, [[engineering]] based publications from across the [[United States]]. It was founded in 1920 mainly through the efforts of Mr. W.B. Littell of a New York advertising firm named Littell-Murray-Barnhill.&lt;ref&gt;E.C.M.A. Handbook, Revised Apr 1982.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Goals==
*Enhance quality of all its member publications by:
**Nurturing cooperation and networking between member publications.
**Holding annual competitions.
**Offering annual workshops.
*Hold annual national conferences (where workshops, competitions, and networking takes place).
*Pursue corporative advertising agreements.

==History==
According to the American Society for Engineering Education's ''[[ASEE Prism|Prism Magazine]]'', "ECMA was created in the 1920s to be a single interface for companies wanting to recruit engineering graduates through ads in the magazines published by engineering colleges."&lt;ref&gt;Gardner, R. (2005, March). [http://www.prism-magazine.org/mar05/tt_on_campus.cfm The Write Time and Place]. ''ASEE Prism,'' 14(7).&lt;/ref&gt; There are records of ECMA member publications meeting for conferences as early as 1923.&lt;ref&gt;Smart, J.W. (Ed.). (1923, March). [http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/UW/UW-idx?type=article&amp;id=UW.WIEv27no6&amp;did=UW.WIEv27no6.i0010&amp;q1=Engineering%20college%20magazines,%20associated,%20holds%20convention%20at%20Urbana Engineering college magazines, associated, holds convention at Urbana]. ''Wisconsin Engineer'', 27(6), 105-107.&lt;/ref&gt;

Over the years, ECMA has evolved into more of a professional society, granting acclaim to student engineering publications and allowing students’ access to many top workers in the publication industry, as well as the knowledge they possess. Every year, one school receives the honor of hosting the ECMA conference. The hosting university then has the opportunity to showcase their magazine, their university, and their way of life.

'''Fayolism''' was a theory of [[management]] that [[Analysis|analyzed]] and [[wikt:synthesis#Noun|synthesized]] the role of [[management]] in organizations, developed around 1900 by the [[France|French]] [[management]] theorist [[Henri Fayol]] (1841–1925).  It was through Fayol's work as a philosopher of administration that he contributed most widely to the theory and practice of organizational management.
[[Image:Fonds henri fayol.jpg|thumb|right|Henri Fayol]]

== Research and Teaching of Management ==
Fayol believed by focusing on managerial practices he could minimize misunderstandings and increase [[efficiency]] in organizations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Pietri|first=P. H|title=Organizational communication: the pioneers|journal=Journal of Business Communication|date=1974|volume=11|issue=4|pages=3–6}}&lt;/ref&gt;  He enlightened managers on how to accomplish their managerial duties, and the practices in which they should engage.  In his book ''General and Industrial Management'' (published in French in 1916, then published in English in 1949), Fayol outlined his theory of general management, which he believed could be applied to the administration of myriad industries.  His concern was with the administrative apparatus (or functions of administration), and to that end he presented his ''administrative theory'', that is, principles and elements of management.

His theories and ideas were ideally a result of his environment—a post revolutionized France with an emerging republic [[bourgeois]]. A bourgeois himself, he believed in controlling workers to  achieve greater productivity over all other managerial considerations. However, through reading ''General and Industrial Management,'' it is apparent that Fayol advocated a flexible approach to management, one he believed could be applied to any circumstance whether in the home, the workplace, or within the state. He stressed the importance and the practice of [[forecasting]] and [[planning]] in order to apply these ideas and techniques, which demonstrated his ability and emphasis in being able to adapt to any sort of situation. In ''General and Industrial Management'' he outlines an agenda whereby, under an accepted theory of management, every citizen is exposed and taught some form of management education and allowed to exercise management abilities first at school and later on in the workplace.

{{quote|Everyone needs some concepts of management; in the home, in affairs of state, the need for managerial ability is in keeping with the importance of the undertaking, and for individual people the need is everywhere in greater accordance with the position occupied.|excerpt from ''General and Industrial Management''}}

== Fayol vs. Frederick Taylor's Scientific Management==
Fayol has been regarded by many as the father of the modern operational management theory, and his ideas have become a fundamental part of modern [[management concept]]s.  Fayol is often compared to [[Frederick Winslow Taylor]] who developed [[Scientific Management]]. Taylor's Scientific Management deals with the efficient organization of production in the context of a competitive enterprise that is concerned with controlling its [[production cost]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Almashaqba|first=Z. S|author2=Nemer Al-Qeed, M|title=The Classical Theory of Organization and {{not a typo|it's}} Relevance|journal=International Research Journal of Finance &amp; Economics|year=2010|volume=41|pages=60–67}}&lt;/ref&gt; Taylor's system of scientific management is the cornerstone of classical theory.  Fayol was also a classical theorist, and referred to Taylor in his writing and considered him a visionary and pioneer in the management of organizations.

However, Fayol differed from Taylor in his focus. Taylor's main focus was on the task, whereas Fayol was more concerned with management.  Another difference between the two theorists is their treatment of workers.  Fayol appears to have slightly more respect for the worker than Taylor had, as evidenced by Fayol's proclamation that workers may indeed be motivated by more than just money.  Fayol also argued for equity in the treatment of workers.

According to Claude George (1968), a primary difference between Fayol and Taylor was that Taylor viewed management processes from the bottom up, while Fayol viewed it from the top down. In Fayol's book ''General and Industrial Management,'' Fayol wrote that {{quote|Taylor's approach differs from the one we have outlined in that he examines the firm from the bottom up. He starts with the most elemental units of activity—the workers' actions—then studies the effects of their actions on productivity, devises new methods for making them more efficient, and applies what he learns at lower levels to the hierarchy...|Fayol, 1987, p.&amp;nbsp;43}} He suggests that Taylor has staff analysts and advisors working with individuals at lower levels of the organization to identify the ways to improve efficiency. According to Fayol, the approach results in a "negation of the principle of unity of command". Fayol criticized Taylor’s functional management in this way. {{quote|… the most marked outward characteristics of functional management lies in the fact that each workman, instead of coming in direct contact with the management at one point only, … receives his daily orders and help from eight different bosses…|Fayol, 1949, p.&amp;nbsp;68.}} Those eight, Fayol said, were 
#route clerks,
#instruction card men
#cost and time clerks
#gang bosses
#speed bosses

This, he said, was an unworkable situation, and that Taylor must have somehow reconciled the dichotomy in some way not described in Taylor's works.

Fayol's desire for teaching a generalized theory of management stemmed from the belief that each individual of an organization at one point or another takes on duties that involve managerial decisions. Unlike Taylor, however, who believed management activity was the exclusive duty of an organizations dominant class. Fayol's approach was more in sync with his idea of Authority, which stated, "...that the right to give orders should not be considered without the acceptance and understanding of responsibility."

Noted as one of the early fathers of the ''Human Relations'' movements, Fayol expressed ideas and practices different from Taylor, in that they showed flexibility and adaptation, and stressed the importance of interpersonal interaction among employees.

=== Fayol's Principles of Management ===
During the early 20th century, Fayol developed 14 principles of management to help managers manage their affairs more effectively. Organizations in technologically advanced countries interpret these principles quite differently from the way they were interpreted during Fayol's time as well. These differences in interpretation are in part a result of the cultural challenges managers face when implementing this framework. The fourteen principles are: 
#[[Division of work]],
#Delegation of authority,
#Discipline,
#[[Command chain|Unity of commands]],
#Unity of direction,
#Interrelation between individual interests and common organizational goals,
#[[Financial compensation|Compensation package]],
#Centralization,
#Scalar chains,
#Order,
#Equity,
#[[Job guarantee]],
#Initiatives,
#Team-Spirit or [[Esprit de corps]].

--&gt;

=== Fayol's Elements (or functions) of Management ===
Within his theory, Fayol outlined five elements of management that depict the kinds of behaviors managers should engage in so that the goals and objectives of an organization are effectively met. The five elements of management are:

#[[Planning]]:  creating a plan of action for the future, determining the stages of the plan and the technology necessary to implement it. Deciding in advance what to do, how to do it, when to do it, and who should do it. It maps the path from where the organization is to where it wants to be. The planning function involves establishing goals and arranging them in a logical order. Administrators engage in both short-range and long-range planning.
#[[Organizing (management)|Organizing]]:  Once a plan of action is designed, managers need to provide everything necessary to carry it out; including raw materials, tools, capital and human resources. Identifying responsibilities, grouping them into departments or divisions, and specifying organizational relationships.
#[[Leadership|Command]]:  Managers need to implement the plan.  They must have an understanding of the strengths and weaknesses of their personnel. Leading people in a manner that achieves the goals of the organization requires proper [[allocation of resources]] and an effective support system.  Directing requires exceptional interpersonal skills and the ability to motivate people. One of the crucial issues in directing is the correct balance between staff needs and production.
#[[Coordination problem|Coordination]]:  High-level managers must work to "harmonize" all the activities to facilitate organizational success.  Communication is the prime coordinating mechanism. Synchronizes the elements of the organization and must take into account delegation of authority and responsibility and span of control within units.
#[[Control (management)|Control]]:  The final element of management involves the comparison of the activities of the personnel to the plan of action, it is the evaluation component of management. Monitoring function that evaluates quality in all areas and detects potential or actual deviations from the organization's plan, ensuring high-quality performance and satisfactory results while maintaining an orderly and problem-free environment. Controlling includes information management, measurement of performance, and institution of corrective actions.

===Effects of Written Communication===
Fayol believed that animosity and unease within the workplace occurred among employees in different departments.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Brunsson|first=K.|title=Some Effects of Fayolism|journal=International Studies Of Management &amp; Organization|year=2008|volume=38|issue=1|pages=30–47}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Many of these "misunderstandings" were thought to be caused by improper communication, mainly through letters (or in present-day emails).  Among scholars of organizational communication and psychology, letters were perceived to induce or solidify a hierarchical structure within the organization.  Through this type of vertical communication, many individuals gained a false feeling of importance.  Furthermore, it gave way to selfish thinking and eventual conflict among employees in the workplace.

This concept was expressed in Fayol's book, ''General and Industrial Management'', by stating," in some firms... employees in neighboring departments with numerous points of contact, or even employees within a department, who could quite easily meet, communicate with each other in writing... there is to be observed a certain amount of animosity prevailing between different departments or different employees within a department. The system of written communication usually brings this result. There is a way of putting an end to this deplorable system ... and that is to forbid all communication in writing which could easily and advantageously be replaced by verbal ones."

==Administrative Theory in the Modern Workplace==

Fayol believed that managerial practices were key to predictability and efficiency in organizations. The Administrative theory views communication as a necessary ingredient to successful management and many of Fayol's practices are still alive in today's workplace.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=McLean|first=Jacqueline|title=Fayol-Standing the test of time|journal=British Journal of Administrative Management|year=2011|issue=74|pages=32–33}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The elements and principles of management can be found in modern organizations in several ways: as accepted practices in some industries, as revamped versions of the original principles or elements, or as remnants of the organization's history to which alternative practices and philosophies are being offered. The U.S. military is a prime example of an organization that has continued to use these principles.

GASB stands for [[Governmental Accounting Standards Board]].

In June 1999, [[List of GASB Statements|GASB Statement]] 34 (or '''GASB 34''') was published. The GASB Chairman characterized the statement as "the most significant change to occur in the history of government financial reporting." GASB 34 provides a comprehensive framework for financial reporting with the objective of making annual reports easier to understand and more useful to the people who rely upon the financial condition contained therein. The most significant aspect of Statement 34 was that for the first time general infrastructure assets (such as roads, bridges and dams) were to be reported together with related depreciation or preservation costs.

For the valuation of infrastructure assets, the Statement authorized both a standard depreciation approach and a modified approach that relied upon asset management analysis and systems as acceptable methods. That action also authorized a combination of the two if, in the judgment of the agency, depreciation was appropriate for some asset classes while the modified approach was appropriate for others.

'''Harry Flood Byrd Sr.''' (June 10, 1887 – October 20, 1966) of [[Berryville, Virginia|Berryville]] in [[Clarke County, Virginia]], was an American newspaper publisher and  political leader of the [[Democratic Party (USA)|Democratic Party]] in Virginia for four decades as head of a political faction that became known as the [[Byrd Organization]]. Byrd served as Virginia's governor from 1925 until 1929, then represented the Commonwealth as a [[United States Senate|United States Senator]] from 1933 until 1965. He came to lead the "[[conservative coalition]]" in the United States Senate, and opposed President [[Franklin Delano Roosevelt]], largely blocking most liberal legislation after 1937.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Mordecai Lee|title=Congress Vs. the Bureaucracy: Muzzling Agency Public Relations|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=xlJXwoAXXmkC&amp;pg=PA211|year=2012|publisher=University of Oklahoma Press|page=211}}&lt;/ref&gt; His son [[Harry F. Byrd Jr.]] succeeded him as U.S. Senator, but ran as an Independent following the decline of the Byrd Organization.

Byrd succeeded to what had been the [[Virginia Democratic Party]] organization of U.S. Senator [[Thomas Staples Martin]] (who died in 1919). Elected the [[List of Governors of Virginia|50th Governor of Virginia]] in 1925, initially Byrd reorganized and modernized Virginia's government. His political machine dominated state politics for much of the first half of the 20th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Frank B. Atkinson|title=Virginia in the Vanguard: Political Leadership in the 400-year-old Cradle of American Democracy, 1981–2006|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=BqputiyLQ3QC&amp;pg=PA7|year=2006|publisher=Rowman &amp; Littlefield|page=7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Financial conditions in Virginia during Byrd's youth conditioned his thinking on fiscal matters and "pay-as-you-go" financial policies.&lt;ref&gt;Ronald L. Heinemann, ''Harry Byrd of Virginia'' (1996)&lt;/ref&gt; Byrd was vehemently opposed to [[racial desegregation]] of the public schools, and was leader of "[[massive resistance]]", a campaign of opposition to the U.S. Supreme Court decisions in [[Brown v. Board of Education]] that led to closure of some public schools in Virginia in the 1950s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Lassiter|first1=Matthew D.|editor1-last=Myers|editor1-first=Andrew|editor2-last=Norrell|editor2-first=Robert|title=Historians in Service of a Better South: Essays in Honor of Paul Gaston|date=2017|publisher=NewSouth Books|isbn=160306446X|page=247|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=nr2yDgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA247|accessdate=28 April 2017|chapter=The Open Schools Revolt: The Southern Regional Council and the Construction of the Moderate South}}&lt;/ref&gt; Students who were denied their education in several Virginia counties became known as the "lost generation."&lt;ref&gt;Terence Hicks, Abdul Pitre, eds., "The Educational Lockout of African Americans in Prince Edward County" (2005), p. 67&lt;/ref&gt; Byrd was perceived as a racist and avowed white separatist.&lt;ref&gt;Clarence M. Dunnaville Jr., ''Governors Recognized for Historic Contributions,'' Virginia Lawyer, Apr. 2014, Vol. 62, Page 44-48&lt;/ref&gt; Although paying his black and white workers similarly, Byrd was vehemently opposed to [[racial desegregation]] even early in the [[New Deal]], and later opposed Presidents [[Harry S. Truman]] and [[John F. Kennedy]] despite their also being Democrats (as well as losing Democratic Presidential candidate [[Adlai Stevenson II|Adlai Stevenson]]) because they opposed racial discrimination within the federal workforce. The Byrd Organization also benefitted from limiting the political participation of blacks and poor whites in Virginia by means of poll taxes and literacy tests, but managed to crush opposition ranging from New Deal Governor [[James Hubert Price|James H. Price]] to gubernatorial and senatorial candidate [[Francis Pickens Miller]].&lt;ref&gt;Ronald L. Heinemann, ''Harry Byrd of Virginia'' (1996)&lt;/ref&gt; Although Byrd never announced as a presidential candidate, he received many votes in the [[United States presidential election, 1956|1956 presidential election]] and 15 electoral votes in the [[United States presidential election, 1960|1960 presidential election]].

==Early life and education==
Harry Flood Byrd was born in [[Martinsburg, West Virginia]], in 1887 (just two weeks after future fellow Virginia Senator [[Absalom Willis Robertson]] was born in the same community). His parents, Eleanor Bolling (Flood) and [[Richard Evelyn Byrd Sr.]], moved the young family to [[Winchester, Virginia]], the same year.

Young Harry Byrd's father became a wealthy apple grower in the [[Shenandoah Valley]] and published [[The Winchester Star|the ''Winchester Star'']] newspaper. Harry initially attended the public schools, but received most of his education from the private [[Shenandoah Valley Military Academy|Shenandoah Valley Academy]] in Winchester.

===Genealogy and family relations===
Byrd's ancestors included the [[First Families of Virginia]]. His paternal ancestors included [[William Byrd II]] of [[Westover Plantation]] (who established [[Richmond, Virginia|Richmond]]), [[Robert Carter I|Robert "King" Carter]] of [[Corotoman]], and [[Pocahontas]].

One younger brother was [[U.S. Navy|Naval]] [[aviator]] and Polar explorer Admiral [[Richard E. Byrd|Richard Evelyn Byrd]] (1888–1957). His other younger brother, Thomas Bolling Byrd (1890–1968) became an infantry captain during [[World War I]]. His uncle [[Henry De La Warr Flood]] served in the [[United States House of Representatives|House of Representatives]] of the [[U.S. Congress]] from [[Appomattox County, Virginia]], (1901 to 1921). Another uncle from Appomattox County, [[Joel West Flood]], served as that county's Commonwealth Attorney (1919 to 1932), in the U.S. Congress (beginning in 1932 to fill the vacancy caused by the death of [[Henry St. George Tucker III|Henry St. George Tucker]]), as a Federal appellate Judge (of the Fifth Circuit based in Richmond), 1940 to 1964).

===Influence on character===

Born only twenty-two years after the end of the [[American Civil War]], Byrd grew up in an era when "the Shenandoah Valley was still a place of genteel poverty&amp;nbsp;... Harry Byrd never lacked food, but he had no money for luxuries. No one had any money. If a man got into debt, there was small chance of getting out of it."&lt;ref&gt;Alden Hatch, ''The Byrds of Virginia'' (1969) p 401&lt;/ref&gt;

Even worse in Byrd's eyes was the dilemma of the state itself, which was also heavily in debt during Byrd's youth. Before the Civil War, Virginia had taken on debt to help finance many internal public improvements (canals, turnpikes, and railroads) through the [[Virginia Board of Public Works]]. Most had been destroyed during the War, although the debt remained and the infrastructure needed to be rebuilt to get crops and goods to market. Virginia's first postwar legislature had affirmed those debts at original terms (highly favorable to bondholders, which by then were mostly out-of-state purchasers at rates a small fraction of par value). Some related to improvements in the area that separated during the war to form the new [[West Virginia|State of West Virginia]]; those were litigated for decades until the [[United States Supreme Court]] ruled in 1915 that West Virginia owed Virginia $12,393,929.50.&lt;ref&gt;Commonwealth of Virginia v. State of West Virginia, 238 U.S. 202 (1915)&lt;/ref&gt; After the [[Reconstruction era of the United States|Reconstruction]] period, most of Virginia's governors insisted upon paying state bondholders, rather than pay for public education (newly added in [[Virginia Constitution]] of 1869) or other government services. The [[Readjuster Party]], which briefly challenged the [[Conservative Party of Virginia (1867)|Conservative Party of Virginia]] which became the Virginia Democratic Party, advocated adjusting the terms of the prewar bonds, but had a relatively brief lifespan.&lt;ref&gt;Allen W. Moger, From Bourbonism to Byrd (Charlottesville: University Press of Virginia 1968)&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, the issue of Virginia's public debt was far from resolved during Byrd's formative years.

===Marriage and family===
Byrd married Anne Douglas Beverley, a childhood friend, on October 7, 1913. They lived with her parents in Winchester until 1916, when he built a log cabin, named Westwood, in [[Berryville, Virginia|Berryville]] at a family-owned orchard, and they moved there. The cabin was constructed from chestnut logs and remains one of the few examples of natural chestnut bark existing in the United States due to the [[chestnut blight]]. The Byrds had three sons: [[Harry F. Byrd Jr.]], Bradshaw Beverley Byrd,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Bradshaw Beverley Bird|url=https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/18579327/bradshaw-beverley-byrd|website=Find a Grave|accessdate=24 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Richard Byrd, and one daughter, Westwood Beverly Byrd. In 1926, Byrd purchased Rosemont, an estate outside Berryville, adjacent to the family apple orchards. The family moved in 1929, at the end of Byrd's term as governor, after some renovations.

==Business career==
As a businessman, Byrd had several operations: publishing newspapers, running a local turnpike, and selling apples and apple products.

In 1903, Harry Byrd took over his father's [[newspaper]], the ''Winchester Star.'' Under his father's ownership, it came to owe $2500 ([[Inflation|{{Inflation|US|2500|1903|2015|r=-2|fmt=eq|cursign=$}}]]) to its [[newsprint]] supplier, the [[Alling and Cory|Antietam Paper Company]]. The company refused to ship more newsprint on credit, so Byrd cut a deal to make daily cash payments in return for ownership. As Byrd would later say, "when you have to hunt for them that way, you get to know how many cents there really are in a dollar." He eventually bought the ''[[Harrisonburg Daily News-Record]]'' and several other papers in the Shenandoah Valley. His family operated these papers until April 1, 2018 when they were sold to The Ogden Newspapers Inc. of Wheeling, W.Va&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.winchesterstar.com/news/business/byrd-family-selling-star-to-ogden-newspapers/article_46684dd3-3d96-5753-b8e6-4cb2c76b2f83.html|title=Byrd family selling Star to Ogden Newspapers|last=Star|first=ADRIAN J. O’CONNOR {{!}} The Winchester|work=The Winchester Star|access-date=2018-09-05|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Thus started what would become Byrd's famous "pay-as-you-go" policy. He developed a lifelong aversion to borrowing money and any indebtedness. "I stand for strict economy in governmental affairs," Byrd proclaimed. "The State of Virginia is similar to a great business corporation&amp;nbsp;... and should be conducted with the same efficiency and economy as any private business." In a fifty-year political career, no statement of Byrd's ever more succinctly spelled out his view of government.&lt;ref&gt;Heinemann, (1996)&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1907, he founded ''[[The Journal (West Virginia newspaper)|The Evening Journal]]'' in nearby [[Martinsburg, West Virginia]]. He sold the paper in 1912 to associate Max von Schlegell.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=''Martinsburg Journal''|url=http://www.wvencyclopedia.org/articles/1553|accessdate=November 24, 2015|publisher=The West Virginia Encyclopedia|date=October 8, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1908, at the age of 21, he became president of [[Valley Pike|The Valley Turnpike Company]], overseeing the Valley Turnpike, a 93-mile (150-km) [[toll road]] between Winchester and [[Staunton, Virginia|Staunton]]. Earning $33 a month, he was required to drive the entire route at least twice a month to inspect it and arrange any repairs. As automobile traffic increased, he ensured road conditions were maintained within the available revenues. He held that office for seven years until his election to state office.

Byrd also owned extensive apple orchards in the Shenandoah Valley and an apple packing operation which was among the largest on the East Coast. He later pointed out that he paid his African American workers the same wages as his white farm workers.&lt;ref&gt;Heinemann, Harry Byrd exact page cite needed&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1950s, [[Edward P. Morgan]]'s assistant visited Byrd's Northern Virginia farm during the apple harvest and was outraged by the living conditions of the [[migrant workers]]. This prompted Morgan to take up the issue of migrant labor in his [[CBS]] Radio Network commentaries. Producer [[Fred W. Friendly]] then prompted his close associate [[Edward R. Murrow]] to produce the television documentary "[[Harvest of Shame]]" on this issue.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Persico|first1=Joseph E.|title=Edward R. Murrow: An American Original|date=1997|publisher=Da Capo Press|isbn=9780306807961}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Virginia politics==
In 1915, while still heading the Valley Turnpike Company, at the age of 28, Byrd was elected to the [[Senate of Virginia|Virginia Senate]]. That election was to begin his 50 years of service in various roles in the state and federal government.

At the [[Virginia State Capitol]] in [[Richmond, Virginia|Richmond]], as a new State Senator, Byrd was initially a progressive with an early interest in road improvements. He was a member of the Senate Committee on Roads, the Finance Committee, the Steering Committee, the Committee on Privileges and Elections, and the Committee of Schools and Colleges. He advocated a tax on gasoline as a fair method of raising revenue for road construction.

[[File:Harry F Byrd 1916.jpg|thumb|left|Byrd as a state senator during the [[Virginia General Assembly, 1916-1917|1916 General Assembly]]]]

However, he first came to prominence in 1922, when he led a fight against using bonded indebtedness as a method to pay for new roads. He feared the state would sacrifice future flexibility by committing too many resources to paying off construction debt. In 1923, Byrd was sued by the Virginia Highway Contractors Association because he said their activities "by combination and agreements may be very detrimental" to the State. The court dismissed the suit, stating the criticism was legal, imposing all costs upon the association. The publicity helped him to be elected [[Governor of Virginia]] in November 1925, easily defeating Republican [[Samuel H. Hoge]] in the general election.

In 1923, he became a member of the Virginia Society of the [[Sons of the American Revolution]].

As governor, serving a term from 1926 to 1930, Byrd pushed through constitutional amendments that streamlined the state government and allowed for more efficient use of tax dollars. He also made property taxes solely a county responsibility. When it was obvious that increased spending on road construction was not enough to "get Virginia out of the mud," he pushed through a secondary roads bill that gave the state responsibility for maintaining county roads. These measures made Byrd seem like a [[New South]] progressive at first. However, many of his measures were more to the benefit of rural areas more interested in low taxes than better services. He instituted a "pay as you go" approach to spending, in which no state money was spent until enough taxes and fees came in to pay for it. Highways and tourism were his primary pursuits, says his biographer. "He advocated building roads to state shrines such as [[Jamestown, Virginia|Jamestown]] and [[Monticello]] and called for historical markers along roadways, the first of which appeared in [[Fredericksburg, Virginia|Fredericksburg]]. He held regional meetings to bring about closer cooperation between state and county road officials, prophesying that the road system could be completed within ten years through such cooperation... A tour of the highway system convinced him of the progress being made in extending the arterial network. Indeed, over 2,000 miles would be added to the system during Byrd's governorship, 1,787 of these miles in 1928. Road building was one way to keep the voters happy and prove the efficacy of pay-as-you-go."&lt;ref&gt;Heinemann, (1996)&lt;/ref&gt;

While he was governor, Byrd built up contacts with the "courthouse cliques" in most of Virginia's counties. He curried support from the five constitutional officers in those counties (sheriff, Commonwealth's attorney, clerk of the court, county treasurer, and commissioner of revenue). This formed the basis of the [[Byrd Organization]], which dominated Virginia politics well into the 1960s. They carefully vetted candidates for statewide office, and Byrd only made an endorsement, or "nod," after consulting with them. Without his "nod," no one could win statewide office in Virginia. While he was governor, he shortened the ballot so that only three officials ran statewide: the governor, lieutenant governor and attorney general. This limited opportunities to challenge the candidates that he wanted to run. His secondary roads bill in 1932, which became known as the [[Byrd Road Act]], did not apply to the state's [[independent city|independent cities]].

Education was not on his agenda, and state spending for public schools remained very low until the 1960s. Byrd became one of the most vocal proponents of maintaining policies of [[racial segregation]]. Byrd authored and signed the "[[Southern Manifesto]]" condemning the 1954 [[U.S. Supreme Court]] decision in ''[[Brown v. Board of Education]]''. His call for "[[massive resistance]]" against desegregation of public schools led to many Virginia schools closing rather than be forced to integrate.&lt;ref&gt;William Bryan Crawley, ''Bill Tuck, a political life in Harry Byrd's Virginia'' (1978) pp 232–35&lt;/ref&gt;

He helped draft a series of laws, known as the [[Stanley plan]], to implement his "massive resistance" policy. This led to closure of some public school systems in Virginia between 1959 and 1964, most notably a five-year gap in public education in [[Prince Edward County, Virginia]].&lt;ref&gt;Numan V. Bartley, ''The rise of massive resistance'' (1999) p 341&lt;/ref&gt;

==National politics==
In the [[United States presidential election, 1928|1928 U.S. presidential campaign]], he supported [[Al Smith]], the Democratic Governor of [[New York (state)|New York]], who would go on to lose to Republican [[Herbert Hoover]]. Byrd himself was an early favorite for the [[United States presidential election, 1932|1932]] presidential nomination{{citation needed|date=December 2017}}, but he opted to endorse [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]] at the right moment and became an official in Roosevelt's successful campaign.

In 1933 Byrd was appointed to fill a vacancy in the [[United States Senate]]; he won reelection as a Democrat in 1933, 1934, 1940, 1946, 1952, 1958, and 1964. Byrd and his colleague [[Carter Glass]] invoked senatorial courtesy to stop Roosevelt's nomination of [[Floyd H. Roberts]] to a federal judgeship in Virginia in 1939. Byrd broke with Roosevelt and became an opponent of the [[New Deal]], but he was an internationalist and strongly supported Roosevelt's foreign policy. As war loomed in 1941 Congress approved his proposal for a joint House–Senate committee to look into ways of eliminating nonessential expenditures. By late September, the Joint Committee on Reduction of Non-essential Federal Expenditures was in operation with Senator Byrd as Chairman; it built his national reputation as an economizer.

By the 1950s Byrd was one of the most influential senators, serving on the [[United States Senate Committee on Armed Services|Armed Services Committee]], and later as chairman of the [[United States Senate Committee on Finance|Finance Committee]]. He often broke with the Democratic Party line, going so far as to refuse to endorse the reelection of liberal President [[Harry S Truman]] in 1948. He also refused to endorse [[Adlai Stevenson II|Adlai Stevenson]] in 1952. He voted against [[public works]] bills, including the [[Interstate Highway System]], and played a key role in the passing of the [[Revenue Act of 1964|1964 Revenue Act]]. He had blocked the bill until President [[Lyndon Johnson]] agreed to decrease the total budget to under $100 billion. Subsequently, he helped push the Act through.&lt;ref&gt;Robert Caro, ''The Passage of Power''&lt;/ref&gt;

Byrd retired from the Senate for health reasons in November 1965. His son, [[Harry F. Byrd Jr.]], was appointed his successor.

==U.S. presidential candidate==
Although Byrd never formally sought the presidency nor became his party's candidate, Southern Democrats drafted him in several campaigns between 1944 and 1960. At the [[1944 Democratic National Convention]], Southern delegates opposed to Roosevelt's New Deal and racial policies nominated Byrd as the party's presidential candidate. He was nominated by Ruth Nooney of Florida, who said she did so without his knowledge or consent. He won 89 delegate votes to Roosevelt's 1,086 ([[James Farley]] of New York got one vote).&lt;ref name="Catledge"&gt;{{cite news|last=Catledge|first=Turner|title=Roosevelt Nominated for Fourth Term|work=New York Times|date=July 21, 1944|pages=1, 9|url=http://partners.nytimes.com/library/politics/camp/440721convention-dem-ra.html |access-date=7 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Jewell|first1=Katherine Rye|title=Dollars for Dixie|date=2017|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=9781107174023|page=233|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=hWBUDgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA233&amp;lpg=PA233|accessdate=7 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; All the convention delegates from Louisiana, Mississippi and Virginia, and 12 of the 36 delegates from Texas voted for Byrd.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Ballot on Renomination Of President Roosevelt|work=New York Times|agency=Associated Press|date=July 21, 1944|page=9|url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=9E04E7D8143EE03BBC4951DFB166838F659EDE&amp;legacy=true|access-date=7 April 2017|subscription=y}}&lt;/ref&gt; In [[United States presidential election, 1952|1952]], both the [[Constitution Party (United States, 1952)|Constitution Party]] and the [[America First Party (1944)|America First Party]] nominated Byrd for vice-president, and [[Douglas MacArthur]] for president, without the consent of either.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Kellman|first1=George|title=Anti-Jewish Agitation|journal=American Jewish Year Book|date=1953|volume=54|pages=93, 94|jstor=23604428|subscription=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; The slate got 17,205 votes nationwide.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=1952 Presidential General Election Results|url=http://uselectionatlas.org/RESULTS/national.php?year=1952&amp;minper=0&amp;f=0&amp;off=0&amp;elect=0|website=US Election Atlas|accessdate=8 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[United States presidential election, 1956|1956]], the year that Byrd initiated the "massive resistance" campaign, the States' Rights Party of Kentucky named Byrd as a presidential candidate. He received 2,657 votes in that state; in South Carolina, in the same election, he received 88,509 votes as the choice of an independent (i.e. [[unpledged elector|unpledged]]) slate of electors with the endorsement of former governor [[James F.

==Legacy==

[[File:Historic Rosemont Manor signature photo.jpg|thumb||alt=A two-story white house with red roof and columned porch.|Historic Rosemont Manor in Berryville, Virginia, Byrd's home from 1929 until his death.]]
[[Virginia State Route 7]], a historic road which leads from Alexandria past Berryville to Winchester and points west, is named the "Harry F. Byrd Highway" through much of its rural length. Byrd's home from 1926 until his death, Rosemont Manor, still exists and is surrounded by about 60 acres. Although many acres of Byrd's former orchards are now commercial and residential properties, Rosemont is now open to the public as a bed and breakfast, as well as event venue.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.virginia.org/listings/PlacesToStay/1811HistoricRosemontManor/&lt;/ref&gt; Although probably eligible for inclusion on the National Register of Historic Places and Virginia Landmarks Register,{{citation needed|date=April 2017}} Rosemont appears outside the current [[Berryville Historic District]] as added in 1987.

Harry F. Byrd Middle School, a [[National Blue Ribbon School]] located in [[Richmond, Virginia|Richmond]] was renamed [[Henrico County Public Schools|Quioccasin Middle School]] in July, 2016 in response to a campaign by the local community; board members agreed "that having a school named after a man who supported school segregation was inappropriate."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=''WTVR TV – Board approves Quioccasin Middle School as new name for Byrd Middle''|url=http://wtvr.com/2016/04/28/byrd-middle-new-name/|accessdate=May 5, 2016|publisher=WTVR TV CBS 6 News|date=April 29, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Welcome, Quioccasin Griffins!|url=http://quioccasin.henricoschools.us/2016/07/07/welcome-quioccasin-griffins/|website=Quioccasin Middle School|accessdate=27 April 2017|date=July 7, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Quioccasin is the name of the road the school sits on, as well as the name of a historically black village in the area.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Freeman|first1=Vernon|title=Quioccasin Middle School ‘officially’ adopts new name, unveils marquee|url=http://wtvr.com/2016/07/14/quioccasin-middle-school-officially-adopts-new-name-unveils-marquee/|accessdate=21 February 2017|work=CBS 6 News|date=July 14, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2391">'''Hellmut Röhnisch''', born 1914 in [[Zeitz]] in [[Germany]], died 1996 in [[Örebro]] in [[Sweden]] was a universal language activist, businessman and athlete.
 
Röhnisch went to school in [[Kassel]] in Germany.  He left Germany with a group of countrymen in 1932. Thus escaping being arrested and prosecuted for his engagement in the German trade union movement in a situation where political circumstances were in turmoil. Röhnisch eventually settled in Örebro in Sweden after travelling, mainly by foot, through [[Poland]], the [[Baltic states]] and [[Finland]].
 
In 1945 Röhnisch won the first ever Swedish Championship in [[gymnastics]]. Röhnisch was engaged as a judge and interpreter for competitions in gymnastics in all World Championships and Olympic Games until 1988 in [[Seoul]]. For his contributions Röhnisch was awarded an honorary membership of the [[International Gymnastics Federation]] ([[Fédération Internationale de Gymnastique|FIG]]).

In 1945 Röhnisch set up a company specialized in gymnastics apparatus. Eventually the company included sportswear in its offering.  The company, Röhnisch Sportswear, is managed by descendants and is since 2002 specialized in sportswear for women.
As a child Hellmut Rönnisch learnt [[Ido (language)|Ido]] from his father Ewald Röhnisch, a leading figure in the German Ido movement. Hellmut Röhnisch was very active in the Ido movement both internationally and in Sweden and served many years as chairman both in the International Union of Ido (ULI) and the [[Swedish Ido Association]].    

When the Swedish Ido Association was dissolved in 1996 the assets of the association were used to set up the [[Ido-foundation for Language Research in Memory of Hellmut Röhnisch]]. The foundation has since then made important contributions to linguistic science and the universal language movement.

[[File:Sailing ship near Java la Grande in Vallard Atlas 1547.jpg|thumb|Sailing ship near [[Java la Grande]] in [[Vallard atlas|Vallard Atlas]] 1547, [[Dieppe school]].]]
'''Jean Ango''' (italianized version for '''Jehan Angot''') (1480–1551) was a [[Normans|Norman]] ship-owner who provided ships to king of France [[Francis I of France|Francis I]] for exploration of the globe. A native of [[Dieppe, Seine-Maritime|Dieppe]], Ango took over his father's import-export business, and ventured into the [[spice trade]] with [[Africa]] and [[India]]. He was one of the first French to challenge the monopoly of [[Spain]] and [[Portugal]], in addition to trading with the eastern Mediterranean, the British Isles, and the Low Countries. He also helped to finance the voyages of [[Giovanni da Verrazzano]] and [[Jacques Cartier]].&lt;ref name=Morison&gt;{{cite book | last = Morison | first = Samuel Eliot | authorlink=Samuel Eliot Morison | title = The European Discovery of America: The Northern Voyages | publisher = Oxford University Press | year = 1971 | location = New York | pages = 260–261}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

His father (also named Jean Ango) sent two ships to Newfoundland in an early colonization attempt, including Jehan Denis and Thomas Aubert as captain of the ''Pensée''.
Their arrival in 1508 is the second recorded voyage of a French ship to the [[Grand Banks of Newfoundland|Grand Banks]] after the expedition of [[John Cabot]]. After his father's death (probably in the final years of the reign of [[Louis XII of France|King Louis XII]]), the younger Jean Ango stopped any personal participation in trading voyages and settled in Dieppe with his inherited fortune.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Gaffarel | first = Paul | title = Jean Ango | publisher = Société Normande de Géographie | year = 1889 | location = Rouen| page = 7 | language = French | isbn= 0-665-04326-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He eventually controlled a fleet, partially or alone, of 70 ships, including merchant ships and fishing vessels.  Although he funded expeditions for trade and exploration, and used his ships (legally) for wartime raids, "he also sponsored voyages whose only purpose was piracy".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Rogozinski | first = Jan | title = Pirates! | publisher = Da Capo Press | year = 1996 | location = New York | isbn = 0-306-80722-X | page = 10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ango was an intimate friend of [[Francis I of France|King Francis I]]. In 1521 he was styled Viscount of Dieppe, and in 1533, after the king had visited him in his mansion in [[Normandy]], captain of Dieppe. When [[John III of Portugal]] confiscated one of his ships which carried plunder from captured vessels, Ango received the French king's permission to respond. Acting under a [[letter of marque]] issued on 26 July 1530, he harassed the Portuguese fleet in the [[Atlantic Ocean|Atlantic]], and even threatened to block the port of [[Lisbon]]. On 15 August 1531, the Portuguese king agreed to pay reparations of 60,000 ducats in return for Ango's agreement to stop his actions and surrender the letter of marque which permitted them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Gaffarel | first = Paul | title = Jean Ango | publisher = Société Normande de Géographie | year = 1889 | location = Rouen| pages = 65–71 | language = French | isbn= 0-665-04326-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He lost popularity under [[Henry II of France|King Henry II]]. Already nearly bankrupt after his forced participation in a royal armament project{{Citation needed|date=November 2009}}, he was imprisoned after 1549 for failing to pay taxes on his profits from privateering.&lt;ref name = Morison /&gt;

In his book ''La chanson des pilotes'', he was the first to describe in writing the use of tobacco.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Poirier | first = Jean-Pierre | title = Lavoisier: Chemist, Biologist, Economist | place = Philadelphia, PA | year = 1996 | page = 417}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''John Shearer Fletcher''' (22 December 1888 – 15 February 1934) was a New Zealand member of the [[New Zealand House of Representatives|House of Representatives]] for {{NZ electorate link|Grey Lynn}} in [[Auckland]]. Born in Scotland, he came to New Zealand in 1916 to join his brothers in their construction business, out of which grew [[Fletcher Construction]].

==Early life==
Fletcher was born at [[Kirkintilloch]], Scotland,{{sfn|Scholefield|1940|p=267}} the son of a builder, John Shearer Fletcher, and his wife, Janet Montgomery.&lt;ref name="DNZB James Fletcher"&gt;{{DNZB|Parker|Selwyn James|4f17|Fletcher, James|31 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; He received his entire education through scholarships.&lt;ref name="EP obit"&gt;{{cite news |title=Obituary |url= http://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/cgi-bin/paperspast?a=d&amp;cl=search&amp;d=EP19340215.2.92 |accessdate=31 October 2014 |work=[[The Evening Post (New Zealand)|The Evening Post]] |volume=CXVII |issue=39 |date=15 February 1934 |page=12}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was one of thirteen children.&lt;ref name="bus_hist"&gt;{{cite web |title=University of Auckland Business History Project - Fletcher Challenge |url= http://www.businesshistory.auckland.ac.nz/fletchers/founders.html |publisher=[[University of Auckland]] |accessdate=1 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By age 24, he was headmaster under the Kirkintilloch school board for technical and commercial classes. He then moved to [[Glasgow]]&lt;ref name="Herald obit" /&gt; and became secretary for the Scottish Class Teachers' Association, and was on the executive of the Scottish Education Institute.{{sfn|Scholefield|1940|p=267}}&lt;ref name="EP obit" /&gt; He was vice-president of the [[YMCA|Young Men's Christian Association]] (YMCA).{{sfn|Scholefield|1940|p=267}} He undertook studies in construction in the United States and in Canada.&lt;ref name="Herald obit"&gt;{{cite news |title=Obituary |url= http://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/cgi-bin/paperspast?a=d&amp;cl=search&amp;d=NZH19340216.2.166 |accessdate=31 October 2014 |work=[[The New Zealand Herald]] |volume=LXXI |issue=21727 |date=16 February 1934 |page=14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Professional career in New Zealand==
In 1916, Fletcher migrated to [[Dunedin]], New Zealand, to join his brothers in their construction business.{{sfn|Scholefield|1940|p=267}} The company had been founded in 1909 after his brother [[James Fletcher (industrialist)|James]]{{sfn|Hunt|2000|p=174}} had come to Dunedin in the previous year.&lt;ref name="DNZB James Fletcher" /&gt; His brother James started to concentrate on business in [[Auckland]] and [[Wellington]], and John Shearer Fletcher took over the Dunedin branch.{{sfn|Scholefield|1940|p=267}}&lt;ref name="DNZB James Fletcher" /&gt; Fletcher was an executive member of the Dunedin Manufacturers' Association.&lt;ref name="AS obit"&gt;{{cite news |title=Mr J Fletcher Dead |url= http://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/cgi-bin/paperspast?a=d&amp;cl=search&amp;d=AS19340215.2.87 |accessdate=31 October 2014 |work=[[Auckland Star]] |volume=LXV |issue=39 |date=15 February 1934 |page=8}}&lt;/ref&gt; Of poor health, he retired from business during the 1920s and moved to Auckland.&lt;ref name="Herald obit" /&gt;

'''Sir John Paul Getty''', {{post-nominals|country=GBR|sep=,|KBE}} ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|g|ɛ|t|i}}; born '''Eugene Paul Getty'''; 7 September 1932 – 17 April 2003), was a [[United Kingdom|British]] philanthropist and [[book collector]]. He was the third of five sons born to [[J. Paul Getty|Jean Paul Getty Sr.]] (1892–1976), one of the richest men in the world at the time, and his wife [[Ann Rork Light|Ann Rork]]. The [[Getty family]]'s wealth was the result of the [[Getty Oil|oil business]] founded by [[George Getty|George Franklin Getty]]. At birth he was given the name Eugene Paul Getty, but in later life he adopted other names, including Paul Getty, John Paul Getty, Jean Paul Getty Jr., and John Paul Getty II. 

In 1986, he was awarded an [[Orders, decorations, and medals of the United Kingdom#Honorary awards|honorary knighthood]] for services to causes ranging from [[cricket]], to art and to the [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative Party]]. His honorary knighthood would eventually become substantive upon the required acquisition of British citizenship.  A long-time [[Anglophile]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/1386478.stm |title=BBC profile: Sir John Paul Getty II |publisher=BBC News |date= |accessdate=1 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; he became a British citizen in 1997. In 1998 he changed his name by [[deed poll]] when he renounced the first name Eugene and wished to be known as Sir Paul Getty, KBE.&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette |issue=55124 |date=12 May 1998 |page=5324 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life==
John Paul Jr. was born onboard ship in the waters near [[Genoa, Italy]], on September 7, 1932, while his parents Ann and J. Paul Getty Sr. were travelling. His birth was registered at [[La Spezia]] with the name Eugenio Paul Getty, when the Italian notary misheard the name John. He would legally alter his name with the Italian authorities to John Paul in 1958.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| title=Painfully Rich| author=John Pearson| year=1995| pp=107–8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He was initially raised in [[Los Angeles, California]]. His parents' marriage was troubled by J. Paul's long absences abroad and his emotional distance. Ann Getty divorced J. Paul Getty Sr. in 1936 in [[Reno, Nevada]], claiming emotional cruelty and neglect. She was awarded $1,000 per month in [[child support]] for each of her sons, Paul Jr. and [[Gordon Getty|Gordon]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| title=Painfully Rich| author=John Pearson| year=1995| p=71}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1938, Ann married her third husband, Joseph Stanton McInerney, and the family moved to [[San Francisco]]. Paul Jr. attended [[St. Ignatius College Preparatory]] and the [[University of San Francisco]], both Jesuit schools. Throughout his adolescence he showed a great interest in reading and music, encouraged by his mother. In 1950 he was drafted to serve in the [[Korean War]], spending the duration working at the American headquarters in [[Seoul, South Korea]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| title=Painfully Rich| author=John Pearson| year=1995| p=99}}&lt;/ref&gt; After he was discharged he met Abigail Harris, the daughter of a prominent San Franciscan Federal judge, and the two were married in early 1956. His first child, [[John Paul Getty III]] was born in November, 1956. The following year he approached his brother, [[Gordon Getty|Gordon Peter Getty]], vice-president of the Getty subsidiary [[Tidewater Petroleum]], asking for a job. His brother gave him a job pumping gas at a Tidewater gas station in San Francisco.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| title=Painfully Rich| author=John Pearson| year=1995| p=104}}&lt;/ref&gt; After a year, his father (whom he had not seen in 12 years) was favourably impressed enough to invite him and the family to [[Paris, France|Paris]], where he offered Paul Jr. a job as President of Getty Oil's Italian subsidiary, Getty Oil Italiana, in [[Rome, Italy|Rome]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| title=Painfully Rich| author=John Pearson| year=1995| p=106}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Marriages==
His first marriage was to Abigail "Gail" Harris, a former [[water polo]] champion. They divorced in 1964, having had four children including [[John Paul Getty III]] and [[Mark Getty]].&lt;ref&gt;His daughter, Aileen Getty, is an AIDS activist formerly married to [[Elizabeth Taylor]]'s son Christopher Wilding; married since 2005 to Bartolomeo Ruspoli (b 1978), son of [[Alessandro Ruspoli, 9th Prince of Cerveteri|Prince Alessandro Ruspoli]]. American writer/columnist [[Liz Smith (journalist)|Liz Smith]] made several mistakes in reporting the second marriage, notably that there were two Aileen Gettys and that the first one (Taylor's ex-daughter-in-law) had died, and that the bride's father had died in 1971 (he was very much alive) [http://entertainment.tv.yahoo.com/entnews/ps/20050426/111451157701.html "Heirs Plan Secret Wedding"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070827000214/http://entertainment.tv.yahoo.com/entnews/ps/20050426/111451157701.html |date=27 August 2007 }}, 26 April 2005; the ''New York Times'' mentioned the marriage in [https://www.nytimes.com/2006/08/10/garden/10spain.html an August 2006 article]&lt;/ref&gt;

His second marriage was to the [[Dutch people|Dutch]] actress, model and style icon [[Talitha Getty|Talitha Pol]] (stepdaughter of painter [[Augustus John]]'s daughter Poppet) on 10 December 1966. The two posed for an iconic photograph on a roof-top in [[Marrakesh]], Morocco in January 1969. The photo, taken by [[Patrick Lichfield]], shows Talitha Getty crouched down leaning on a wall and her husband in the background in a hooded djellaba and sunglasses. The photo appeared in [[Vogue (magazine)|American ''Vogue'']] and again in the September 1999 issue of American ''Vogue'' and is part of the collection of the [[National Portrait Gallery (London)|National Portrait Gallery]] in London. Two and a half years after the photo was taken, Talitha died of a heroin overdose on 14 July 1971. She was survived by her son with Getty: Tara Gabriel Gramophone Galaxy Getty (born June 1968), an ecological conservationist in Africa.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nndb.com/people/157/000025082 NNDb profile for J. Paul Getty Jr.] Retrieved 21 November 2007. At some point, Tara dropped his third and fourth names. In 1999, an Irish newspaper revealed that he and six other family members had been granted Irish passports and citizenship, and he was now known as ''Tara Gabriel Getty''.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1994, he married for the third and final time, to Victoria Holdsworth (Lady Getty)

==Personal problems==
After he married Talitha in 1966, the couple became immersed in the 1960s [[Counterculture of the 1960s|counter culture]], living between Rome and [[Marrakesh, Morocco]]. During a trip to [[Thailand]], the couple developed serious [[heroin]] addictions. When Getty Sr., who abhorred drug-taking of any kind, heard of his son's addiction, he insisted on his becoming sober. Paul Jr. refused and tendered his resignation from Getty Oil Italiana. The couple lived off his income from the family trust, which amounted to $100,000 a year. In 1969, he and Talitha separated as she decided to focus on becoming sober. He purchased No. 16 [[Cheyne Walk]] in [[Chelsea, London]], where the Victorian artist [[Dante Gabriel Rossetti]] had lived in the 1860s, for Talitha and their baby son Tara to live in, while he remained in Rome.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| title=Painfully Rich| author=John Pearson| year=1995| pp=147–8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Death of Talitha===
After living apart for several years, Talitha, who was sober at the time, asked Paul Jr. for a divorce in early 1971. Still in love with his wife, he insisted that she come to Rome and try for a reconciliation. When her lawyer advised her that divorce proceedings would be easier if she could show that she had attempted reconciliation with Paul, she left for Rome on 9 July.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| title=Painfully Rich| author=John Pearson| year=1995| pp=150–51}}&lt;/ref&gt; On the morning of 14 July 1971, she was found dead in the Getty apartment in [[Piazza d'Aracoeli]]. The autopsy ruled that she had [[alcohol (drug)|alcohol]] and [[barbiturate]]s in her system, but rumours flared up that she had suffered a heroin [[relapse]] while spending time with Getty, who was still embroiled in his addiction.&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;{{cite book| title=Painfully Rich| author=John Pearson| year=1995| p=155-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

In December 1971, Italian authorities announced that an inquest would be held into Talitha's death the following March; they requested that Getty meet with investigators to describe the circumstances surrounding her death. Afraid that his own drug addiction would result in his being indicted and potentially imprisoned, Getty left for England.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt; He ignored a subsequent request by an Italian judge to return to Italy for the inquest. Neither an arrest warrant, nor an [[extradition request]] was ever issued, since Getty was never a suspect in Talitha's death, but he never returned to Italy for fear of being detained.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;

==Son's kidnapping==
After his second wife's death, Getty became reclusive for a time and his heroin addiction worsened, fueled by guilt for his wife's death. In 1973, his eldest son, [[John Paul Getty III]], was kidnapped in Rome by [[Calabria]]n [['Ndrangheta]] mobsters and held in the Calabrian Mountains, chained to a stake in a cave. Getty did not have enough money to pay the $17&amp;nbsp;million ransom demand, and his father refused to help, saying "I have 13 other grandchildren, and if I pay one penny now, then I will have 14 kidnapped grandchildren."&lt;ref name="Julie Miller"&gt;{{cite article| first=Julie|last=Miller| url=https://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/2017/12/all-the-money-in-the-world-j-paul-getty| title=The Enigma of J. Paul Getty, the One-Time Richest Man in the World| work=[[Vanity Fair (magazine)|Vanity Fair]]| publisher=[[Condé Nast]]| location=New York City| date=December 22, 2017| access-date=December 28, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, when one of his son's ears was delivered by mail to a newspaper in Rome (delivery had been delayed by three weeks because of a postal strike), his father finally agreed to help out with the ransom through a $2.2 million payment (the maximum that was tax-deductible) and a $1 million loan which he extended to his son at 4% interest.&lt;ref name="Julie Miller"/&gt;

==Later life==
In 1976, Getty's father died. Over the next decade Getty suffered from depression and, in a final attempt to end his [[drug addiction]], checked himself into the [[London Clinic]] in 1984. While there he received a visit from the then-Prime Minister [[Margaret Thatcher]] to thank him for large donations to the [[National Gallery, London|National Gallery]]. She reportedly helped speed his recovery by telling him, "My dear Mr. Getty, we mustn't let things get us down, must we? We'll have you out of here as soon as possible." During a low period in the 1970s Getty had been cheered up by the former England [[cricket]]er and later President of the [[Marylebone Cricket Club|MCC]], [[Gubby Allen]], having previously been introduced to the game by [[Mick Jagger]] of the [[Rolling Stones]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=''Wisden Cricketers' Almanack'' 2004; E W Swanton (1996) ''Last Over''}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Paul III struggled with [[PTSD]] from his kidnapping for years, self-medicating with alcohol and drugs. In April 1981 he suffered a major drug overdose which left him paralyzed and almost completely blind. The following November, his mother Gail sued her ex-husband for $25,000 per month to support their son's medical expenses.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite article| first1=Suzanne|last1=Adelson|first2=Maria|last2=Wilhelm| url=http://people.com/archive/paralyzed-and-blind-from-a-drug-overdose-paul-iii-is-the-star-crossed-getty-vol-16-no-24/| title=Paralyzed and Blind from a Drug Overdose, Paul III is the Star-Crossed Getty| work=[[People (magazine)|People]]| publisher=[[Meredith Corporation]]| location=New York City| date=December 14, 1981| access-date=April 1, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite the fact that Paul II was earning over $20 million a year from his family trust, he had refused to pay a penny towards the treatment, leaving his brother [[Gordon Getty|Gordon]] to pay his nephew's expenses. The [[litigation]] judge who allowed the case to go to trial scolded Paul Jr.: "Mr. Getty should be ashamed of himself spending far more money on court obligations than living up to his moral duties."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| first=John|last=Pierson| title=Painfully Rich| publisher=[[Harper Collins]]|location=New York City|year=1995|ISBN=978-0312135799| p=244}}&lt;/ref&gt; Claiming that he doubted the severity of his son's debilitation, Getty sent his lawyer to Los Angeles to confirm it firsthand, which led him to finally agree to shouldering the costs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=John|last=Pierson| title=Painfully Rich| publisher=[[Harper Collins]]|location=New York City|year=1995| ISBN=978-0312135799 |p=245}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Wormsley Park===
During his nine-month stint in the London Clinic, Getty decided to purchase a dilapidated country estate west of London, [[Wormsley Park]], on the advice of his close friend [[Christopher Gibbs]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| title=Painfully Rich| author=John Pearson| year=1995| publisher=Harper Collins| p=272}}&lt;/ref&gt; After his release in March 1986, he devoted himself to remodeling the 18th-century mansion and restoring the 3,000 acres of parkland. This included the creation of a [[Deer park (England)|deer park]], the reforestation of 1,500 acres of [[beechwood]] forest, and the dredging of a man-made 4 acre lake filled with water tapped from an aquifer 400 feet below ground.&lt;ref name="John Pearson 1995"&gt;{{cite book| title=Painfully Rich| author=John Pearson| year=1995| publisher=Harper Collins| p=282}}&lt;/ref&gt; Along with the restoration of the [[Georgian architecture|Georgian]] mansion house, overseen by Gibbs, Getty added a castle-like addition made of local [[flint]] built to house his extensive library, an indoor heated pool, and a replica of [[The Oval]] cricket ground. To house his disabled son, he had an [[accessibility|accessible]] cottage built near the pool, from where he could do his water rehabilitation exercises. The 6-year project cost an estimated ₤60 million.&lt;ref name="John Pearson 1995"/&gt;

From Wormsley, Getty was able to host his long-estranged family and gradually improve his relations with his children and ex-wife.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| title=Painfully Rich| author=John Pearson| year=1995| publisher=Harper Collins| p=290}}&lt;/ref&gt; To inaugurate his professional cricket ground, Getty hosted a match in September 1992 captained by the Cricketing legends [[Imran Khan]] and [[Bob Wyatt]], with the Prime Minister [[John Major]] and [[Queen Elizabeth the Queen Mother]] as his guests of honour.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| title=Painfully Rich| author=John Pearson| year=1995| publisher=Harper Collins| pp=320–321}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Philanthropy==

Getty donated over [[pound sterling|£]]140m to various artistic and cultural causes. The [[National Gallery, London|National Gallery]] alone received £50m from him. He was appointed [[Order of the British Empire|Knight of the Order of the British Empire]] (KBE) in 1987, but as a foreign national he could not use the title "Sir". In December 1997 he was granted [[British nationality law|British citizenship]] and immediately renounced his [[Citizenship in the United States|US nationality]]. [[Elizabeth II of the United Kingdom|The Queen]] reportedly commented: "Now you can use your title. Isn't that nice?"&lt;ref&gt;[http://articles.chicagotribune.com/1998-03-10/news/9803110369_1_excellent-order-knighted-british-empire "American-born Billionaire Getty Knighted By Queen"], ''[[Chicago Tribune]]'', 10 March 1998; retrieved 15 June 2018.&lt;/ref&gt;

He became President of [[Surrey County Cricket Club]] for one year, and gave money to [[Lord's Cricket Ground]] to build a new stand. He combined his loves of cricket and books when he purchased the ownership of ''[[Wisden Cricketers' Almanack|Wisden]]'', the famous publishers of the cricketing almanack. Getty built an extraordinary library at Wormsley, collecting such treasures as a first edition of [[Chaucer]], [[Ben Jonson]]'s annotated copy of [[Edmund Spenser|Spenser]], and [[William Shakespeare|Shakespeare]] [[Early texts of Shakespeare's works#Folios|Folios]]. He was a notable member of the exclusive [[Roxburghe Club]], famous among book collectors. {{Citation needed|date=January 2012}}

His personal fortune was estimated as about £1.6&amp;nbsp;billion. He donated significant support for the [[National Gallery]], the [[British Museum]], the [[British Film Institute]], [[Hereford Cathedral]], [[St Paul's Cathedral]], the [[Imperial War Museum]], and [[St James's, Spanish Place|St. James Catholic Church]].&lt;ref name="charlotteedwardes"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/1446836/Getty-leaves-bulk-of-fortune-to-son-Mark.html|title=Getty leaves bulk of fortune to son Mark|author=Charlotte Edwardes|date=16 November 2003|work=Telegraph.co.uk|accessdate=4 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some of his donations, especially contributions towards the purchases of [[Canova]]'s ''[[The Three Graces (sculpture)|The Three Graces]]'' by [[The National Galleries of Scotland]]&lt;ref&gt;[https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9D01E1DE1330F930A2575BC0A962958260 "Getty son pledges money to keep statue in Britain"], ''[[New York Times]]'', 13 August 1994; retrieved 31 August 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; and the ''[[Madonna of the Pinks]]'' by [[Raphael]], foiled acquisition efforts by the [[J. Paul Getty Museum]] endowed by his father. In June 2001, he gave £5&amp;nbsp;million to the [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative Party]]. He endowed a ₤20 million charitable trust which supports the arts, conservation and [[social welfare]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| title=Painfully Rich| author=John Pearson| year=1995| publisher=Harper Collins| p=271}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Death==
Getty died, aged 70, on 17 April 2003, having been admitted for treatment to a London hospital for a chest infection.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Billionaire Getty dies|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/2956737.stm|accessdate=1 July 2011|work=BBC News|date=17 April 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Media portrayals==
Getty Jr. is portrayed by [[Andrew Buchan]] in the film ''[[All the Money in the World]]'' and by [[Michael Esper]]  in the television series ''[[Trust (U.S. TV series)|Trust]]'', both of which dramatize Getty III's kidnapping.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|first=Denise|last=Petski|url=http://deadline.com/2017/06/trust-michael-esper-co-star-j-paul-getty-ii-fx-drama-series-veronica-echegui-recur-1202117531/|title=‘Trust’: Michael Esper To Co-Star In FX Getty Drama Series; Veronica Echegui To Recur|work=[[Deadline Hollywood]]|publisher=[[Penske Media Corporation]]|location=Los Angeles, California|date=June 21, 2017|access-date=June 22, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Estates==
John Phipps amassed almost {{convert|2500|acre|km2}} of rolling Virginia farm lands in [[The Plains, Virginia]] including Brenton, an 1889 stone manor house. He was a [[polo]] player and [[Thoroughbred]] racehorse owner, and the property assembled from 1928 onwards would be the site of his Rockburn Stud farm. Upon his death it passed to his son Hubert.

Phipps purchased an old {{convert|160|acre|km2|sing=on}} [[Quaker]] farm on [[Long Island]] where he built a large mansion with magnificent gardens that,&lt;ref name="1912Tea"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Times|first1=Special To The New York|title=Mr. and Mrs. J.S.

'''John Peter Boden''' (born 1 June 1961), often shortened to '''Johnnie Boden''',&lt;ref name="BBC "/&gt; is an entrepreneur and founder of [[Boden (clothing)|Boden]], a catalogue clothing company, in 1991. As of 2014, Boden is worth £300&amp;nbsp;million.

== Early life ==
John Peter Boden was born on 1 June 1961{{where|date=September 2018}}. His father&lt;ref name="Info "/&gt; was a [[Lieutenant colonel (United Kingdom)|lieutenant colonel]] who changed careers to become a farmer.&lt;ref name="Info "/&gt; John Boden was educated at Hawtreys preparatory school, then [[Eton College]], and read [[Philosophy, Politics and Economics|philosophy, politics, and economics]] (PPE) at [[Oriel College, Oxford]].&lt;ref name="Info "/&gt;

== Career ==
At 16, he edited the menswear section of the 1977 ''Harpers &amp; Queen Teenage Edition'', but Boden's father was "dismissive", calling it a "stupid job".&lt;ref name="T"&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/finance/newsbysector/retailandconsumer/9935907/Johnnie-Bodens-fashion-brand-is-the-love-of-his-life.html | title=Johnnie Boden's fashion brand is the love of his life | work=The Telegraph | date=17 March 2013 | accessdate=24 March 2014 |author1=Hopper, David |author2=Vallance, Charles}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After leaving university, Boden became a stockbroker with Barclays Merchant Bank,&lt;ref name="T "/&gt; and [[SG Warburg Securities]].&lt;ref name="ES"&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.standard.co.uk/news/go-johnnie-go-boden-is-a-500m-business-success-story-6513083.html | title=Go, Johnnie, go Boden is a £500m business success story | work=The Evening Standard | date=13 September 2010 | accessdate=24 March 2014 | author=Prynn, Jonathan}}&lt;/ref&gt; spending some time at [[Wall Street]].&lt;ref name="Info "/&gt; He was a stockbroker for five years.&lt;ref name="BBC "/&gt; However, he "loathed" the job,&lt;ref name="BBC "/&gt; and was "ill-suited&amp;nbsp;– really bad at it".&lt;ref name="T "/&gt; He ceased working as a stockbroker when he received an inheritance from a childless uncle.&lt;ref name="T "/&gt; He dabbled in other jobs, as a [[publican]] and teacher&lt;ref name="T "/&gt; in London.&lt;ref name="Info "/&gt; Boden enjoyed teaching, though disliked the low salaries.&lt;ref name="T "/&gt;

=== Boden ===

He founded [[Boden (clothing)|Boden]] in 1991,&lt;ref name="BBC "/&gt; launching his first catalogue featuring pictures drawn by a friend,&lt;ref name="T "/&gt; with eight menswear products available&lt;ref name="BBC "/&gt; modelled by his friends.&lt;ref name="Info "/&gt; In 1992, Boden realised women were a better target for clothes, and launched women's clothing, followed by children's clothing,&lt;ref name="BBC "/&gt; under the name 'Mini Boden', in 1996.&lt;ref name="T "/&gt; However, it took "at least 10 years" for the finances to settle down due to robbery, and other circumstances; which ultimately led his inheritance to be gone in under three years.&lt;ref name="T "/&gt; The firm is known for its "bright prints".&lt;ref name="BBC "/&gt;

His foundation of Boden has enabled Boden to amass a personal fortune of £300mil (2014), placing him at 368 on the [[Sunday Times Rich List]].&lt;ref name="List"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://features.thesundaytimes.co.uk/rocj;ost/2013/live/richlist/view/group6/1/rank/-/boden#list | title=The Sunday Times Rich List | work=The Sunday Times | date=21 April 2013 | accessdate=7 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Karel Aalbers''' (born June 28, 1949, [[Velp, Gelderland|Velp]]) was the President of the [[Association Football|football]] club [[Vitesse Arnhem]] ([[Arnhem]], the [[Netherlands]]) from 1984 until February 2000.

==Career==
Aalbers' goal was to bring Vitesse from the bottom of the Second League (Eerste divisie, now [[Eerste Divisie|Keuken Kampioen Divisie]]), where the club was when he
started, to the top 40 soccer clubs of Europe.

He developed the basic idea for the ‘[[Gelredome]]’, a stadium with a sliding pitch that can be moved out of the building. Later, the same system was applied in [[Gelsenkirchen]] ([[Schalke 04]]) and in [[Japan]]. Events such as pop concerts can be held without damaging the grass. Gelredome opened in 1998. It has a roof that can be opened and closed. It is fully climate controlled as well. In the first season after the opening, Gelredome's attendance rose to 20,000, (from less than 8,000 in the old stadium.)

He financed the ambitions by making solid profits on the transfer market. Players such as [[Roy Makaay]], [[Sander Westerveld]], [[Nikos Machlas]], [[Glenn Helder]] and [[Phillip Cocu|Philip Cocu]] were sold for large sums of money. Others came to occupy empty player positions, such as [[Mahamadou Diarra]] and [[Pierre van Hooijdonk]].

Vitesse ranked top 4 positions, made profit and showed a solid balance sheet in the final years of his presidency.

Aalbers resigned on February 15, 2000,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last = Ritsema | first = André | title = Aalbers moet bij Vitesse weg als voorzitter | work = [[NRC Handelsblad]] | language = Dutch | date = 2000-02-16 | url = http://www.nrc.nl/W2/Nieuws/2000/02/16/Spo/01.html | accessdate = 2008-09-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; after the main sponsor, Nuon, threatened to pull the plug if he did not. Nuon, as a public utility
company, owned by local authorities, had trouble explaining why it invested heavily in Aalbers' ambitious plans.

His successor was Jan Koning (former chief of Sara Lee/DE who resigned after 4 month). In a short period of time, Vitesse began to show negative financial results, due to poor deals on the transfer market. The club survived numerous financial crises, such as the last one in 2008, when debts were bought of, under the threat of bankruptcy.

Aalbers is currently a marketing expert and consultant in city and stadium development. He acts as a matchmaker in international projects. He and his wife live in [[Eerbeek]].

'''Leander James McCormick''' (February 8, 1819 – February 20, 1900) was an [[Americans|American]] inventor, manufacturer, philanthropist, and businessman and a member of the [[McCormick family]] of Chicago and Virginia. Along with his elder brothers Cyrus and William, he is regarded as one of the fathers of modern agriculture due to his part in the development of the McCormick Reaper and what became the International Harvester Company. He also owned and developed vast amounts of [[real estate]] in downtown [[Chicago]] and [[Lake Forest, Illinois]].  In 1885 he donated one of the world's largest telescopes to the University of Virginia.

==Life==
Leander James McCormick was a member of the prominent [[McCormick family]] of Chicago. He was born February 8, 1819 in [[Rockbridge County, Virginia]] on February 8, 1819 to [[Robert McCormick (Virginia)|Robert McCormick, Jr.]] (1780–1846) and Mary Ann "Polly" Hall (1780–1853).
He was the fourth of five sons and was raised at the family homestead known as [[Cyrus McCormick Farm|Walnut Grove]], near [[Raphine, Virginia|Raphine]] in Rockbridge County, in the [[Shenandoah Valley]] on the western side of the [[Blue Ridge Mountains]]. His elder brother Robert Hall McCormick died as a teenager, and his younger brother John Prestly McCormick also died as a young adult. His father invented agricultural machines including the mechanical [[reaper]], for which Leander's eldest brother [[Cyrus McCormick]] received the patent in 1834. Leander eventually developed multiple improvements to the reaper and received patents for two of them, with the remainder being patented by his brother Cyrus. At age 26, McCormick married Henrietta Maria Hamilton on her parents' homestead, Locust Hill, in Rockbridge County on October 22, 1845. The following year their father Robert McCormick, Jr. died. Leander had a third share of the reaper business, which amounted to 75 machines in 1846.&lt;ref name="obit"/&gt;

In 1847 Leander helped Cyrus set up a factory in [[Cincinnati, Ohio]] that produced 100 machines.
In fall 1848 he moved to [[Chicago]] with his wife and infant son to join Cyrus in setting up an even larger factory.
Another older brother [[William Sanderson McCormick]] joined in 1850 in a business in run by Cyrus to manufacture reapers and sell them across the [[midwestern United States]]. They created what eventually became the [[McCormick Harvesting Machine Company]], with Leander taking over management of the manufacturing department, which he controlled for the next 30 years. By 1870, the McCormicks were one of the wealthiest families in the [[United States]].

In 1871, the [[Great Chicago Fire]] destroyed much of the Reaper Works and other buildings, as well as the Leander McCormick family residence at the corner of [[Rush Street (Chicago)|Rush Street]] and Ohio Street, {{coord |41|53|32|N| 87|37|31|W| type:landmark_region:US-IL |display=inline |name= Rush Street at Ohio}}. Leander, his wife and children fled their burning home in the early morning hours. They moved to the west side of the city for the next several years. The McCormicks, under Leander's direction, quickly rebuilt and recovered. By 1879, the business had fully recovered and was merged into a corporation. Leander stayed active in the management of the business until 1889 when he retired.&lt;ref name="family"/&gt;{{rp|320}}
After retiring from the business, McCormick then invested heavily in real estate.

McCormick donated funds for a refracting [[telescope]] to the [[University of Virginia]]. The telescope and building are known as [[McCormick Observatory]] and opened in 1885; the telescope was the largest in the U.S. and second largest in the world when completed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title= The McCormick Family and their Mechanical Reaper |url= http://www.astro.virginia.edu/research/observatories/26inch/history/reaper.php |publisher= Leander McCormick Observatory Museum |accessdate= December 28, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Virginia Hotel, Chicago, 1893.jpg|thumb|alt=rectangular building |Sketch of Virginia Hotel from 1893 brochure]]
In his later years, McCormick remained in Chicago and began to research the McCormick genealogy. He eventually produced and published a book on the McCormick family.&lt;ref name="family"&gt;{{cite book |title= Family record and biography |author= Leander James McCormick |year= 1896 |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=QC83AAAAMAAJ }}&lt;/ref&gt;
In 1889 he funded construction of the Virginia Hotel at  Rush and Ohio, where McCormick spent the rest of his life.
The 400-room hotel was advertised as "an absolutely fire-proof building and a finished hotel second to no other."&lt;ref name="hotel"&gt;{{cite book |title= The Virginia Hotel, Chicago |publisher= Press of J.C. Winship &amp; Company |year= 1893 |url= https://archive.org/details/virginiahotelchi00lawr }}&lt;/ref&gt;
The hotel featured ornate granite interiors decorated with marble statues, separate "gentlemen's smoking room" and "ladies dining room", and a room of boilers and dynamos to offer the latest technology: electric lights. It was ready in time for the 1893 [[World's Columbian Exposition]].&lt;ref name="hotel"/&gt;
His wife died in November 1899, and he died on February 20, 1900 at the Virginia Hotel.&lt;ref name="obit"&gt;{{cite news |title= Leander J. McCormick Dead |newspaper=Lexington gazette |location= Lexington, Virginia |date= February 28, 1900 |url= http://chroniclingamerica.loc.gov/lccn/sn84024716/1900-02-28/ed-1/seq-3/ |accessdate= December 30, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
At the time of his death, he had extensive holdings in [[downtown Chicago]], and a stock farm in [[Lake Forest, Illinois]].

'''Marketing science''' is a field that approaches [[marketing]]&amp;nbsp;– the understanding of customer needs, and the development of approaches by which they might be fulfilled&amp;nbsp;– predominantly through  [[scientific method]]s, rather than through tools and techniques common with research in [[the arts]] or in [[humanities]]. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://greenbookblog.org/2016/07/14/what-does-marketing-science-bring-to-the-table/|title=What Exactly Is Marketing Science?|work=GreenBook|access-date=2018-02-21|language=en-us}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The field of marketing science, in the pursuit of "truths" in marketing, is related to, but more general than [[marketing research]], which is oriented towards a specific product, service or campaign.

Before marketing science was formally labeled, its activity appeared as [[management science]] within the [[marketing]] framework.&lt;ref&gt;David B. Montgomery 2001. "Management Science in Marketing: Prehistory, Origin, and Early Years of the INFORMS Marketing College." Marketing Science 20 (4): 337–348. {{doi|10.1287/mksc.20.4.337.9762}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The interaction between academics and practitioners in marketing science dates back to 1961, with the founding of the [[Marketing Science Institute]]. Interest in marketing science as a field grew in the late 1980s and early 1990s as electronic [[point-of-sale]] data grew and  [[barcode reader]]s led to a "marketing information revolution." &lt;ref&gt;Robert C. Blattberg, Rashi Glazer, and John D.C. Little, eds. 1994. The Marketing Information Revolution. Boston Mass.: Harvard Business School Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

Before conferences were organized with a "marketing science" label, four meetings were convened as "Market Measurement and Analysis" conferences from 1979 to 1982, sponsored by [[The Institute of Management Sciences]] and the [[Operations Research Society of America]].&lt;ref&gt;Dick R. Wittink 2001. "Market Measurement and Analysis: The First ‘Marketing Science’ Conference." Marketing Science 20 (4): 349–356. {{doi|10.1287/mksc.20.4.349.9758}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The first officially labeled Marketing Science Conference was hosted by the [[UCLA Anderson School of Management|School of Management at UCLA]] in 1983.

== Marketing science and Big Data ==
The marketing profession has long relied on data. But as the [[data flood]] gets bigger, progressive marketers are turning to [[big data]] analysis methods as well as systematic observation, testing and measurement to study broad [[behavioral pattern]]s, [[drill down]] from the [[Data aggregation|aggregate]] to the individual and produce new insights that improve business outcomes.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4580">'''Maxim Yuryevich Lazovsky''' ({{lang-ru|Макси́м Ю́рьевич Лазовский}}, nicknames '''"Max"''', '''"Lame"'''; July 31, 1965 – April 28, 2000) was a former [[KGB]] and [[Federal Security Service of the Russian Federation|FSB]] officer&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Rozhnov|first1=Georgy|title=ЛАЗОВСКИЙ БЫЛ ОФИЦЕРОМ ФСБ|url=http://2002.novayagazeta.ru/nomer/2002/23n/n23n-s08.shtml|agency=[[Novaya Gazeta]]|date=1 April 2002}}&lt;/ref&gt; who became involved in underground business. According to [[Alexander Litvinenko]] and co-authors he was also suspected of participation in [[Russian apartment bombings]] in 1999, along with other crimes including [[murder]]s and [[kidnapping]]s.

Maxim Lazovsky was born in [[Grozny]], [[Chechnya]]. In 1992, Lazovsky organized a gang that was linked to the [[Chechen mafia|Chechen criminal groups]] which tried to control oil business in the neighbouring regions. Lazovsky was co-owner of the firm Lanako, engaged in oil business. In the same firm worked Captain Andrey Shchelenkov, who died from an explosion of his own bomb on a railway bridge in Moscow on November 18, 1994. Colonel Vladimir Vorobyev, who shortly after organized another act of terrorism in Moscow: the explosion of a trolleybus in December 1994, also cooperated closely with Lazovsky.

In February 1996, Lazovsky was detained by the Moscow Criminal Investigation department (MUR) and accused of various criminal activities together with the Moscow FSB employee Alexey Jumashkin and six other FSB employees. In 1997 Lazovsky was convicted to two years for illegal possession of drugs and weapons. He was released in 1998.

According to [[Yuri Felshtinsky]] and [[Vladimir Pribylovsky]], Lavosky was involved in staging [[Russian apartment bombings|bombings in Moscow in 1999]].&lt;ref name="Assassins"&gt;[[Yuri Felshtinsky]] and [[Vladimir Pribylovsky]] ''The Age of Assassins. The Rise and Rise of Vladimir Putin'', Gibson Square Books, London, 2008, {{ISBN|1-906142-07-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On April 28, 2000, Lazovsky was shot by unknown assassins on the entryway of a church in the village of Uspenskoye, [[Odintsovsky District]] near Moscow, where he lived.

'''Michael Corcoran''' (September 21, 1827 – December 22, 1863) was an [[Irish people|Irish]]-born [[Americans|American]] general in the [[Union Army]] during the [[American Civil War]] and a close confidant of President [[Abraham Lincoln]].&lt;ref name="HS" /&gt; As its colonel, he led the [[U.S. 69th Infantry Regiment|69th New York Regiment]] to Washington, D.C.  and was one of the first to serve in the defense of Washington by building [[Fort Corcoran]]. He then led the 69th into action at the [[First Battle of Bull Run]].  After promotion to brigadier general, he left the 69th and formed the ''Corcoran Legion'', consisting of at least five other New York regiments.

==Early life==
[[File:69th INF REG COA.gif|thumb|left|Coat of arms of [[69th Infantry Regiment (New York)|The Fighting 69th]].]]
Corcoran was born in Carrowkeel, near [[Ballymote]], [[County Sligo]] in Ireland.&lt;ref name="TWG" /&gt;&lt;ref name="HS"/&gt;&lt;ref name="WoS"/&gt;
He was the only child of Thomas Corcoran, an officer in the [[British army]],&lt;ref name="HC"&gt;{{cite web
|url= http://www.historycentral.com/Bio/UGENS/USACorcoran.html
|title=American History and World History

|work= www.historycentral.com
|accessdate=2007-02-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Mary McDonagh. Through his mother, he claimed descent from [[Patrick Sarsfield, 1st Earl of Lucan|Patrick Sarsfield]], hero of the [[Williamite War in Ireland]] and leader of the [[Wild Geese (soldiers)|Wild Geese]].&lt;ref name="69th" /&gt;

At the age of 18, in 1846 he took an appointment to the Revenue Police, enforcing the laws and searching for illicit stills and distilling activities in [[Creeslough]], [[County Donegal]].
He also joined a guerrilla group called the [[Ribbonmen]].

On August 30, 1849, he emigrated from [[Sligo]] Bay to the U.S. and settled in New York City where he found work as a clerk in the tavern, Hibernian House, at 42 Prince Street in [[Manhattan]] owned by John Heaney, whose niece, Elizabeth, he married in 1854.

He enlisted as a [[Private (rank)|Private]] in the [[69th Infantry Regiment (New York)|69th New York Militia]]. By 1859 he was appointed [[Colonel (United States)|colonel]] of the regiment.  The regiment was a state militia unit at that time composed of citizens, not soldiers, and was involved in the maintenance of public order. On October 11, 1860, Colonel Corcoran refused to march the regiment on parade for the 19-year-old [[Edward VII of the United Kingdom|Prince of Wales]], who was visiting New York City at the time, protesting the British imposition of the [[Irish Potato Famine|Irish Famine]].  Corcoran was removed from command and a [[court martial]] was pending over that matter when the [[American Civil War|Civil War]] began.&lt;ref name="NYT"&gt;{{cite news |title=CITY MILITARY.; The Court-Martial of Col. Corcoran |url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=950CE6DC1630E134BC4F52DFB767838B679FDE |work=The New York Times |date=1860-11-17 |accessdate=2007-12-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Corcoran also became involved in [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic]] politics at [[Tammany Hall]]: he could deliver the Irish vote. He became  district leader, a member of the judicial nominations committee, an elected school inspector for his ward, and a member of the Fourteenth Ward General Committee.&lt;ref&gt;Harold Holzer, New-York Historical Society, [https://books.google.com/books?id=98uKmoB8o9gC&amp;pg=PT95&amp;dq=michael+corcoran+civil+war+democrat&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=DvfCUt-WIcnfsAS_2YGYDQ&amp;ved=0CD0Q6AEwAw#v=onepage&amp;q=michael%20corcoran%20civil%20war%20democrat&amp;f=false The Civil War in 50 Objects], 2005&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;North &amp; South Magazine, [https://books.google.com/books?ei=GvjCUvmZJ-uhsASI7oHYDQ&amp;id=8nMTAQAAMAAJ&amp;dq=michael+corcoran+civil+war+tammany+democrat&amp;focus=searchwithinvolume&amp;q=democratic+party+politics Tragedy at Suffolk: The Corcoran-Kimball Affair], Volume 3, 2000, page 67&lt;/ref&gt;

==Civil War==
[[File:69th New York Militia.jpg|thumb|Officers of the [[U.S. 69th Infantry Regiment|69th New York Volunteer Regiment]] pose with a cannon at Fort Corcoran in 1861. Michael Corcoran at left]]
With the outbreak of war, the court martial was dropped and Corcoran was restored to his command because he had been instrumental in bringing other Irish immigrants to the Union cause.  He led the 69th to Washington, D.C. and served for a while in the Washington defenses building Fort Corcoran.  In July he led the regiment into action at the [[First Battle of Bull Run]] and was taken prisoner.
Corcoran was one of the founders of the [[Fenian Brotherhood]] in America. While in jail, Corcoran wrote, "One half of my heart is Erin's, and the other half is America's.  God bless America, and ever preserve her the asylum of all the oppressed of the earth, is the sincere prayer of my heart." &lt;ref&gt;Demeter, Richard. The Fighting 69th: A History. Pasadena: Craford Press, 2002. p.37&lt;/ref&gt;

In April, 1863 Corcoran was involved in an incident that ended with Corcoran shooting and killing Edgar A. Kimball, commander of the  [[9th New York Volunteer Infantry Regiment]].  Corcoran attempted to pass through the 9th New York's area without giving the required password after receiving the challenge from a sentry.  When Kimball intervened on the side of the sentry, Corcoran shot Kimball.&lt;ref&gt;Matthew John Graham, [https://books.google.com/books?id=OBxCAAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA413&amp;dq=%22michael+corcoran%22+killed+edgar+kimball+letter&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=iuo_U7XWNMzNsQTAw4DoCw&amp;ved=0CCsQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=%22michael%20corcoran%22%20killed%20edgar%20kimball%20letter&amp;f=false The Ninth Regiment, New York Volunteers (Hawkins' Zouaves): Being a History of the Regiment and Veteran Association from 1860 to 1900], 1900, pages 411-415&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/3295 Edgar A. Kimball] at ''Find Grave''&lt;/ref&gt;  Corcoran was not charged with a crime or reprimanded, and continued to serve.

==The Enchantress Affair==
While Corcoran was imprisoned the U.S. had made threats to execute captured [[Confederate States Army|Confederate]] [[privateer]]s.  Corcoran and several other Union prisoners were selected by lot for execution if the U.S. carried out its threats against the privateers.{{citation needed|date=January 2014}}  This event was known as the [[Enchantress Affair]], but no executions were ever carried out by either side.  Corcoran was then offered a parole under the conditions that he not take up arms against the Confederacy.  Intending to resume his place in the Union army upon his release he refused the offer of parole.  He was appointed [[Brigadier general (United States)|Brigadier General]] of volunteers in July and exchanged in August 1862.  His role in the Enchantress Affair and his refusal for parole gained him some attention and upon his release he was invited to dinner with President [[Abraham Lincoln]].

==Corcoran Legion and Death==
[[File:Currier_%26_Ives_-_Brig.-Genl._Michael_Corcoran.jpg|thumb|right|Currier &amp; Ives lithograph of Brig. Gen. Michael Corcoran]]
Corcoran returned to the army and set about recruiting more Irish volunteers.  He raised and took command of what would be known as the ''Corcoran Legion'':&lt;br&gt;
The Legion consisted of:
*1st Regiment-formed of the 1st and 6th Regiment; later the [[182nd New York Volunteer Infantry]]
*2nd Regiment-formed of the 5th and 6th Regiment; later the [[155th New York Volunteer Infantry]]
*3rd Regiment-formed of the 3rd; 7th and 8th Regiment; later the [[164th New York Volunteer Infantry]]
*4th Regiment-formed of the 2nd Regiment; later the [[170th New York Volunteer Infantry]]
*5th Regiment-never served with Brigade; later the [[175th New York Volunteer Infantry]]
*6th Regiment-below minimum strength-later part of 1st and 2nd Regiment
*7th Regiment-below minimum strength-later part of the 3rd Regiment
*8th Regiment-below minimum strength-later part of the 3rd Regiment

Placed in command of the 1st Division, VII Corps he was engaged in the [[Battle of Deserted House]] and took part in the [[Battle of Suffolk (Hill's Point)|siege of Suffolk]].  In late 1863 he was placed in command of a division in the [[XXII Corps (Union Army)|XXII Corps]] and returned to serve in the Washington defenses. While riding alone in [[Fairfax, Virginia]] he was thrown from a runaway horse and suffered a fractured skull. He died at the [[William Gunnell House (Fairfax, Virginia)|W.P. Gunnell House]] on December 22, 1863 at the age of 36.

Corcoran was largely idolized by his Irish-American troops.  His name, and that of the New York 69th, figure prominently in many of the Irish Union ballads of the day:

"America's Irish Brigade": 'When [[Jefferson Davis]] he sounded alarms, the sons of Columbia rushed into arms, and our noble militia to Washington sped, with the brave Michael Corcoran marching at head'

"Song of the Regiments": 'We have volunteers to fight who have pride and brave and darin, [[Thomas Francis Meagher]] and his gallant sons of Erin, the Massachusetts ninth, Michael Corcoran's Irish legion, and all the rank and file of every state and region'

"The Fighting 69th": "...They're a band of men brave stout and bold, from Ireland they came; and they had a leader to the fold. Mick Corcoran was his name."

"Boys That Wore The Green": "...Colonel Corcoran led the Sixty-ninth on that eventful day, I wish the Prince of Wales were there to see him in the fray; His charge upon the batteries was a most glorious scene, With gallant New York firemen, and the boys that wore the green."

"The Irish Volunteer": "...When the Prince of Wales came over here, and made a hubbaboo, Oh, everybody turned out, you know, in gold and tinsel too; But then the good old Sixty-ninth didn't like these lords or peers-- They wouldn't give a damn for kings, the Irish volunteers! We love the land of Liberty, its laws we will revere, "But the divil take nobility!" says the Irish volunteer!"

"We'll Fight for Uncle Sam": "...I used to cry out soap fat because that was my trade sir-- Till I 'listed for a soldier-boy with Corcoran's brigade, sir."

==Ballymote Memorial==

[[Baron]] '''Nils Taube''' (25 July 1928 &amp;ndash; 11 March 2008) was Britain's longest serving fund manager. A colleague of [[George Soros]] and advisor to [[Lord Rothschild]], he also anticipated the 1987 stockmarket crash, while delivering an annual return of 15 percent for over 35 years while he ran his own fund.

==Biography==
[[Baron]] Nils Otto von Taube was born on 25 July 1928 to  Valerie Olga Doreen Girard de Soucanton (born 1904), who was daughter of William Girard de Soucanton, the Homourary British consul in [[Reval]], owner of trading company Thomas Clayhills and Son and Beatrice Carr,&lt;ref&gt;[http://daten.digitale-sammlungen.de/~db/bsb00000600/images/index.html?id=00000600&amp;fip=qrsxdsydeayaewqeayaewqenxdsydxdsydsdas&amp;no=11&amp;seite=399 Stackelberg, Otto Magnus von: Genealogisches Handbuch der estländischen Ritterschaft, Bd.: 1, Görlitz, [1931]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.archivesportaleurope.net/ead-display/-/ead/pl/aicode/EE-RA/type/fa/id/EAA.4924/dbid/C81551611 William Girard de Soucanton, Thomas Clayhills and Son]&lt;/ref&gt; and an upper-class [[Baltic Germans|Baltic German]] father Baron Axel von Taube (1901-1945),&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.geni.com/people/Axel-von-Taube/6000000011480425544 Axel Reinhold Nikolai von Taube]&lt;/ref&gt; his family were resettled to [[Reichsgau Wartheland]] in 1939 as part of the secret protocols of the [[Molotov–Ribbentrop Pact]] requiring the resettlement of ethnic Germans from Estonia and Latvia.

Taube moved to London in 1946 to study Chemistry, but with family to support he left for the City in 1948, joining Kitcat &amp; Aitken as an office junior.

He made his name investing in then-undervalued German shares and rose rapidly through the ranks, becoming an analyst in 1951, fund manager in 1969 and senior partner in 1975. Taube's main fund was the St James's Place Greater European Progressive fund, which returned an average of 15.74% a year between 1969 and 2006. He also ran the St James's Place International Unit Trust, which grew an average of 15.23% a year between 1971 and 2006.&lt;ref&gt;https://moneyweek.com/baron-nils-taube-the-worlds-greatest-investors/&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1970s, he worked with George Soros, helping him to make money by introducing him to the gilts market. Soros was so impressed that he invited Taube on to the advisory board of the Quantum Group of hedge funds.

When in 1982, Jacob Rothschild's RIT and Northern bought a stake in Kitkat &amp; Aitken it was said that the deal was devised to gain access to Taube, who became Rothschild's principal investment manager, a position he held until 1996. That year he left to establish [[Taube Hodson Stonex Partners]], building up assets of £9 billion.&lt;ref&gt;https://moneyweek.com/baron-nils-taube-the-worlds-greatest-investors/&lt;/ref&gt; In 2006 he started Nils Taube Investments, where he worked until his death.

After the collapse of Communism, Taube became involved in charitable and advisory work for his native country. He helped run the Soros Open Estonia Foundation, became an adviser to an Estonian cabinet committee overseeing state investment, and was a member of the prime minister's research and development council.

His charitable work, for which he was honoured by Estonia in 1998, included paying for a cancer research laboratory at Tartu University and the funding of physics research.

In 1969, Taube was one of the four founders of the [[Institute for Fiscal Studies]].&lt;ref&gt;https://www.ifs.org.uk/about/blog/21&lt;/ref&gt;

Taube put his success down to caution, joking that "we only invest in countries where they wear overcoats in the winter". In recent months he had been buying gold and energy stocks, blaming the current market turmoil on the "mass stupidity" of "smartypants investors" who had been labouring under the delusion that it is possible to "buy listed companies and gear them up 10 times".

When asked recently if he was predicting a crash he replied: "I can't say I'm not" - and he described the present crisis as being "a cross between 1987 and the early 70s, when the market disintegrated".
 
After Estonia regained independence, he was a member of the Estonian prime minister's research and development council, advisor to an Estonian cabinet committee overseeing state investments and helped run the Soros Open Estonia Foundation. He funded a cancer research laboratory at [[Tartu University]].

==Personal life==
Taube is survived by his wife, Idonea, born Tudor, daughter of Lt.-Col. [[Owen Frederick Morton Tudor]] and Hon. Noreen Rosamund Anne Tufton, Idonea is a granddaughter of admiral Henry Morton Tudor and John Sackville Richard Tufton, 2nd [[Baron Hothfield]] of Hothfield and his wife Lady Ierne Louisa Arundel [[Earl of Huntingdon|Hastings]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thepeerage.com/p56476.htm The Peerage]&lt;/ref&gt; She married Baron Nils Taube on 19 January 1954 and they have three sons.

==Death==
Taube died of a stroke on 11 March 2008 in [[London]], [[England]], at the age of 79.

Kaufman's investment banking practice primarily encompasses advising Boards of Directors, private equity firms, and buyers and sellers of distressed, stressed or "story" situations. Because it does not represent creditors, Gordian is able to achieve meaningful equity recoveries in insolvent situations.

'''Policy alienation''' refers to a framework which examines the experiences of governmental employees with new policies they have to implement. It has been used to describe the experiences of front-line public professionals with new policies. It is defined "as a general cognitive state of psychological disconnection from the policy programme being implemented."

==Introduction==
A number of examples can clarify the concept of policy alienation. For example, Bottery (1998:40),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Bottery|first=M.|title=Professionals and policy: Management strategy in a competitive world|year=1998|publisher=Routledge|location=London|isbn=0-304-70157-2|url=https://www.amazon.com/Professionals-Policy-Management-Competitive-Education/dp/0304701572}}&lt;/ref&gt; examining the pressures on professionals stemming from new policies in education and [[health care]] in Great Britain, cites a teacher arguing that: “The changes have been outrageous, and have produced a culture of meritocracy and high flyers. There’s massive paperwork because the politicians don’t believe teachers are to be trusted.” This indicates that professionals had difficulties identifying with the policies they had to implement. A second example refers to the introduction of a new reimbursement policy in mental healthcare in the Netherlands. In one large-scale survey, as many as nine out of ten professionals wanted to abandon this new policy (Palm et al., 2008).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Palm, I., Leffers, F., Emons, T., Van Egmond, V., &amp; Zeegers, S.|title=De GGz ontwricht: Een praktijkonderzoek naar de gevolgen van het nieuwe zorgstelsel in de geestelijke gezondheidszorg|year=2008|publisher=SP|location=The Hague|url=http://www.sp.nl/service/rapport/081025GGZ_ontwricht.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; Psychologists even went as far as to openly demonstrate on the street against this policy. A major reason for this was that many could not align their professional values with the content of the policy. As one professional noted:

''"Within the new healthcare system economic values are dominant. Too little attention is being paid to the content: professionals helping patients. The result is that professionals become more aware of the costs and revenues of their behavior. This comes at the expense of acting according to professional standards.”''{{Attribution needed|date=June 2012}}

Overall, a number of studies show an increasing discontent among public professionals toward public policies (see also Hebson et al., 2003; White, 1996),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Hebson, G., Grimshaw, D., &amp; Marchington, M.|title=PPPs and the changing public sector ethos: Case-study evidence from the health and local authority sectors|journal=Work Employment and Society|year=2003|volume=17|issue=3|pages=481–501|doi=10.1177/09500170030173005|url=http://wes.sagepub.com/content/17/3/481.short|accessdate=13 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=White, D.|title=A balancing act: Mental health policy-making in Quebec|journal=International Journal of Law and Psychiatry|year=1996|volume=19|issue=4|pages=289–307|pmid=8968814|doi=10.1016/s0160-2527(96)80005-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; although more positive experiences can also be found (Ruiter, 2007).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Ruiter, A. E. P.|title=Implementatie van het structureel echoscopisch onderzoek: Samenwerking en kwaliteitsdenken|year=2007|publisher=University of Twente|location=Twemte|url=http://essay.utwente.nl/58027/}}&lt;/ref&gt; The policy alienation framework was developed to better understand the experiences of front-line public professionals with new policies.

==Effects of policy alienation==
Currently, there is an intense debate concerning professionals in the public sector. Many of the pressures that professionals face are related to the difficulties they have with the policies they have to implement.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|editors=Duyvendak, W. G. J., Knijn, T., &amp; Kremer, M.|title=Policy, people, and the new professional. de-professionalisation and re-professionalisation in care and welfare|year=2006|publisher=[[Amsterdam University Press]]|location=Amsterdam|isbn=978-90-5356-885-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; When implementers are unable to identify with a policy, this can negatively influence policy effectiveness. Furthermore, a high degree of policy alienation can  affect the quality of interactions between professionals and citizens, which may eventually influence the output legitimacy of government.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|authors=Bekkers, V. J. J. M., Edwards, A., Fenger, M., &amp; Dijkstra, G.|title=Governance and the Democratic Deficit, assessing the legitimacy of governance practices|year=2007|publisher=Aldershot|location=Ashgate|isbn=0-7546-4983-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; The policy alienation framework is used to analyze this topic.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Tummers|first=L.G. |author2=Bekkers, V.J.J.M. |author3=Steijn, A.J.|title=Policy alienation of public professionals: Application in a new public management context|journal=Public Management Review|year=2009|volume=11|issue=5|pages=685–706|doi=10.1080/14719030902798230|url=http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/14719030902798230}}&lt;/ref&gt;
It has been shown that policy alienation increases resistance to a new policy, lowers behavioral support for the policy and decreases job satisfaction of public professionals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Tummers, L.G.|title=Policy alienation - Analyzing the experiences of public professionals with new policies|year=2012|publisher=Erasmus University Rotterdam|location=Rotterdam}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Hence, it has both influences on the individual professional, as well as on  policy effectiveness.

== Conceptualization ==
Alienation broadly refers to a sense of social estrangement, an absence of social support or meaningful social connection. Sociologists, [[public administration]] scholars, and other social scientists have used the alienation concept in various studies. As a result, a number of meanings have been attributed to the term.&lt;ref name=Kanungo&gt;{{cite book|last=Kanungo|first=R.|title=Work alienation: an integrative approach|year=1982|publisher=Praeger Publishers|location=New York|isbn=978-0-03-060241-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; In an attempt to provide clarity, Seeman broke these meanings down into [[Social alienation|five alienation dimensions]]: powerlessness, meaninglessness, normlessness, social isolation, and self-estrangement.

Many scholars have used these dimensions to devise operational measures for alienation so that they can examine the concept in a range of settings. Mau, for example, used four dimensions in examining student alienation. Rayce et al., when investigating adolescent alienation, used three of the five dimensions. Further, many other researchers have used Seeman’s classification in examining the concept of work alienation. [[Bob Blauner|Blauner]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Blauner, R.|title=Alienation and freedom|publisher=University of Chicago Press|location=Chicago}}&lt;/ref&gt; devised operational measures for three of the dimensions: powerlessness, meaninglessness, and social isolation.

The policy alienation framework was conceptualized based on the works of sociologists such as [[Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel|Hegel]], [[Karl Marx|Marx]], Seeman, and Blauner.  Furthermore, works of public administration scholars were used, particularly on [[Michael Lipsky|Lipsky]] (street-level bureaucracy). Like work alienation, policy alienation is multidimensional, consisting of policy powerlessness and policy meaninglessness dimensions. In the work alienation literature, the dimensions of powerlessness and meaninglessness are also considered very important.&lt;ref name=Kanungo /&gt;

In essence, powerlessness is a person's lack of control over events in their life. In the realm of policy formulation and implementation, policy powerlessness relates to the degree of influence public professionals have over shaping a policy program. Powerlessness can occur when a new policy is drafted without the help of the professionals, by for example not consulting their professionals associations or labor unions. Furthermore, on an operational level professionals can feel powerless when they have to adhere to tight procedures and rules when implementing a policy (see also [[Michael Lipsky|Lipsky]]). This kind of powerlessness may be particularly pronounced in professionals whose expectations of discretion and autonomy contradict notions of bureaucratic control (see also [[Profession]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Freidson, E.|title=Professionalism: The third logic|year=2001|publisher=Cambridge University Press|location=Cambridge|isbn=0-226-26203-0|url=https://www.amazon.com/Professionalism-Third-Logic-Practice-Knowledge/dp/0226262030}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The second dimension of policy alienation is meaninglessness. In the realm of policy making and implementation, policy meaninglessness refers to a professional’s perception of the contribution that the policy makes to a greater purpose, most notably to society or to their own clients. For instance, a professional can feel that implementing a policy is meaningless, if it does not deliver any apparent beneficial outcomes for society, such as more safety on the streets.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Van Thiel, S., &amp; Leeuw, F. L.|title=The performance paradox in the public sector|journal=Public Performance and Management Review|year=2002|volume=25|issue=3|pages=267–281|doi=10.2307/3381236|url=http://repub.eur.nl/res/pub/1577/BSK074.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

To make the dimensions more specific, five sub-dimensions were identified: strategic, tactical and operational powerlessness, societal and client meaninglessness. This is shown in the table below.

'''Five sub-dimensions of policy alienation'''
{| class="wikitable"
|-
! Sub-dimension !! Definition !! Example of high scores
|-
| Strategic powerlessness || The perceived influence of the professionals on decisions concerning the content of the policy, as is captured in rules and regulations || A professional feeling that the policy is drafted without the help of implementing professionals or professional associations.
|-
| Tactical powerlessness || The professionals’ perceived influence on decisions concerning the way policy is implemented within their own organization. || Professionals stating that the managers in the organization did not consult them or their colleagues when designing the implementation process for the policy.
|-
| Operational powerlessness || The perceived degree of freedom in making choices concerning the sort, quantity and quality of sanctions and rewards on offer when implementing the policy. || Answering ‘fully agree’ to a survey question on whether the professional feels that their autonomy during the implementation process was lower than it should be.
|-
| Societal meaninglessness || The perception of professionals concerning the added value of the policy to socially relevant goals. || Stating in an interview that “I agree with the policy goal of enhancing transparency, but I do not see how this policy helps in achieving this goal.”
|-
| Client meaninglessness || The professionals’ perceptions of the added value of their implementing a policy for their own clients. || A professional who argues that a particular policy seriously impinges on their clients’ privacy.

'''Pre-packaged insolvency''' (a "pre-pack") is a kind of [[bankruptcy]] procedure, where a restructure plan is agreed in advance of a company declaring its insolvency. In the [[United States]] pre-packs are often used in a [[Chapter 11]] filing. In the [[United Kingdom]], pre-packs have become popular since the [[Enterprise Act 2002]], which has made [[Administration (law)|administration]] the dominant insolvency procedure. Such arrangements are also available in [[Canada]] under the [[Companies' Creditors Arrangements Act]].

==United Kingdom==
{{see also|UK insolvency law}}
The term "pre-pack sale" has been defined by the Association of Business Recovery Professionals as, "an arrangement under which the sale of all or part of a company’s business or assets is negotiated with a purchaser prior to the appointment of an administrator, and the administrator effects the sale immediately on, or shortly after, his appointment".&lt;ref name="r3.org.uk"&gt;http://www.r3.org.uk/media/documents/technical_library/SIPS/SIP%2016%20E&amp;W.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;  The difference between a pre-pack sale and a normal sale is that in a normal sale the administrator markets the business and negotiates the terms of the sale after his appointment.

The reasons an administrator sells on a [[pre-pack]] basis, rather than after post-appointment marketing, vary from case to case, but they often involve the following considerations. A pre-pack sale avoids the costs of trading (which means creditors receive more back), and indeed, the company and the administrator may not have the funds to trade. It also avoids the administrator taking on the risks associated with trading. The value of the business may deteriorate during administration trading.

There may be other factors to prevent trading, such as regulatory problems.&lt;ref&gt;see, for example, Re DKLL Solicitors [2007] EWHC 2067 (Ch), http://www.bailii.org/ew/cases/EWHC/Ch/2007/2067.html for consideration of these issues&lt;/ref&gt;

The courts have held that an administrator can sell the company's assets immediately upon his appointment, without court approval or the approval of the creditors,&lt;ref&gt;Re T&amp;D Industries Plc [2000] 1 WLR 646; Re Transbus International Limited [2004] 1 WLR 2654&lt;/ref&gt; and he can do so even if the majority creditor objects.&lt;ref&gt;Re DKLL Solicitors [2007] EWHC 2067 (Ch), http://www.bailii.org/ew/cases/EWHC/Ch/2007/2067.html&lt;/ref&gt; Courts have even approved transactions that, as a "necessary evil", have made payments to the former management while leaving little or nothing to [[unsecured creditor]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Re [[Halliwells LLP]] [2010] EWHC 2036 (Ch) at para 20 http://www.bailii.org/cgi-bin/markup.cgi?doc=/ew/cases/EWHC/Ch/2010/2036.html&amp;query=halliwells+and+LLP&amp;method=boolean&lt;/ref&gt;

In January 2009, the Association of Business Recovery Professionals issued ''Statement of Insolvency Practice 16''&lt;ref name="r3.org.uk"/&gt; to require insolvency practitioners acting as administrators to disclose a number of matters to all creditors as soon as possible after the completion of the sale. This was done in an attempt to provide greater transparency to creditors.

On 1 November 2013, following a government-commissioned review, a new ''Statement of Insolvency Practice 16'' was introduced. It requires administrators to disclose the following:&lt;ref&gt;http://lucasjohnson.co.uk/statement-of-insolvency-practice-16.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;
*The source of the administrator’s initial introduction and the date of the introduction
*The extent of the administrator’s involvement prior to appointment
*The alternative courses of action that were considered by the administrator, with an explanation of possible financial outcomes
*Whether efforts were made to consult with major creditors
*Why it was not appropriate to trade the business and offer it for sale as a going concern, during the administration
*Details of requests made to potential funders to fund working capital requirements
*Details of registered charges and dates of creation
*If the business or business assets have been acquired from an insolvency practitioner within the previous 24 months, or longer if the administrator deems that relevant to creditors’ understanding, the administrator should disclose both the details of that transaction and whether the administrator, administrator’s firm or associates were involved
*Any marketing activities conducted by the company and/or the administrator and the outcome of those activities

The main benefit of a pre-pack administration is the 'continuity' of the business - the company is protected by the court. This gets rid of debts and contracts. It does not get rid of employees due to the [[Transfer of Undertakings (Protection of Employment) Regulations 2006]] (TUPE).  Another big advantage is that the cost of the process is lower than trading administration, as the administrators do not need to find funding to trade the business. The downside of a pre-pack administration is that it can attract negative publicity if the former directors are seen to be shedding liabilities.

The [[Insolvency Service]] monitors compliance with SIP 16.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.bis.gov.uk/insolvency/insolvency-profession/regulation/statements-of-insolvency-practice/sip-16-reports-pre-packs&lt;/ref&gt; Its reports show that in 2010 it reported 10 insolvency practitioners to their licensing bodies, and in 2011 it reported 21.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.accountancyage.com/aa/news/2174788/21-ips-reported-compliance-pre-packs-2011&lt;/ref&gt;

==United States==
In the United States, typically the term ''pre-packaged insolvency'' is recoined as '''pre-packaged bankruptcy'''.  A conventional bankruptcy case is one in which the debtor files for Chapter 11 relief without having agreed in advance to the terms of a plan of reorganization with its creditors. During the course of the Chapter 11 case, the debtor or, if the debtor does not retain the exclusive right to propose a plan, a creditor or creditor group may formulate and propose a plan of reorganization.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Pros And Cons Of Prepackaged Bankruptcy|url=http://www.stblaw.com/docs/default-source/cold-fusion-existing-content/publications/pub1647.pdf?sfvrsn=2|publisher=Law 360|accessdate=28 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; A company undergoing Chapter 11 reorganization is effectively operating under the ''protection'' of the court until it emerges. An example is the [[airline industry]]; in 2006, over half the industry's [[seating capacity]] was on airlines that were in Chapter 11.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title = Delta and Northwest airlines both file for bankruptcy | url = http://money.cnn.com/2005/09/14/news/fortune500/bankruptcy_airlines/ | accessdate = November 17, 2005 | work=CNN | date=2005-09-14 | first1=Chris | last1=Isidore | first2=/Money | last2=Senior}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a pre-packaged case, the plan proponents will have secured sufficient support from creditors to confirm their plan of reorganization prior to filing for Chapter 11 reorganization. Pre-packaged plans of reorganization virtually always impair (i.e. pay less than in full) one or more classes of creditors, and so in order to ensure that the plan can be confirmed by the bankruptcy court, the plan proponents must secure the support of at least two-thirds in amount and more than one-half in number of at least one such impaired class, in addition to ensuring the plan complies with all other requirements for confirmation. Two procedurally difficult aspects of the process are the announcement (which must be structured so as not to trigger contractual termination provisions) and getting the requisite creditor approval.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.law360.com/bankruptcy/articles/820493|title=3 Tips For Acing A Prepackaged Ch. 11 - Law360|website=www.law360.com|access-date=2016-07-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2009, a new entity completed the purchase of continuing operations, assets and trademarks of [[General Motors]] as a part of the 'pre-packaged' [[Chapter 11]] reorganization.&lt;ref name=Stoll&gt;Stoll, John D., and Neil King Jr. (July 10, 2009).[https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB124722154897622577 GM Emerges From Bankruptcy].''The Wall Street Journal''.

==Criticism==
A review from [[Wolverhampton University]] identified the several criticisms of pre-pack sales.  There is a general concern that the pre-pack administrator, in agreeing to the pre-pack in consultation with the company’s management team (and usually its secured creditors), favours the interests of the managers and secured creditors ahead of those of the unsecured creditors.  The speed and secrecy of the transaction often lead to a deal being executed, about which the unsecured creditors know nothing and offers them little or no return.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Wellard|first1=Mark|last2=Walton|first2=Peter|title=A Comparative Analysis of Anglo-Australian Pre-packs: Can the Means Be Made to Justify the Ends?|journal=International Insolvency Review|date=26 Sep 2012|volume=21|issue=3|pages=143–181|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/iir.1201/abstract|accessdate=28 July 2014|doi=10.1002/iir.1201}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There is often a suspicion that the consideration paid for the business may not have been maximized due to the absence of [[open market]]ing. Credit may have been incurred inappropriately prior to the pre-pack and this may not be fully investigated.&lt;ref&gt;"When is pre-packaged administration appropriate?"http://www.ntu.ac.uk/nls/document_uploads/112698.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;  Criticism of this nature had been levelled at pre-pack sales by John Moulton of [[Alchemy Partners]] in January 2009, saying 'Pre-packs could be very easily abused. Bad management can plan for a prepack months in advance, line up an administrator – and then be back running the business immediately. It means when retailers fail they are often being kept with the same directors when it would be much healthier if new management arrived and with fresh money to invest".&lt;ref&gt;http://www.dailymail.co.uk/money/article-1104725/Pre-pack-deals-risk-cheating-creditors-Private-equity-boss-warns-abuse-quickie-bankruptcy.html#ixzz0rDL91vtB&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Quality bias''' in [[Price index|price indices]] is a kind of mismeasurement if they do not incorporate data on the quality of goods from period to period, as well as their nominal price.

Personal computers are a canonical case.  Because of improvements in computer chips, greater and greater speeds and features have become available, without substantial increases in price.  If only price information on personal computers were used, quality bias would cause growth in a [[consumer price index]] (CPI) to be overestimated, since an equivalent computer would actually be much cheaper in later periods.

==Determining quality==
{{off topic|date=April 2013}}
Quality bias can work both ways.  Faster computers with enhanced performance require greater [[Memory (computers)|memory]] and more expensive support [[software]].  Most [[personal computer]]s were previously [[Product bundling|bundled]] with software, but now come only with a basic [[operating system]] and a requirement for the purchaser to purchase the bundled software after a "trial period", so the actual ''value'' per dollar is much lower.  [[Obsolescence]] is built into most personal electronics, shortening their useful live, again lowering the actual value.  All these issues make the quality bias tend to be negative rather than positive.  As products and the manufacturing methodology advances, the cost of manufacture is expected to go down, and improved products are part of every product life cycle, and many products go through repeated cycling.  An example is the automobile.  Quality bias is most often seen in a negative manner in the cases of mature products as companies lower their acceptance standards in order to increase their [[profit margin]]s.  There is no effective measure for declining quality, unfortunately, which is why some nations such as Germany and Japan have developed very meticulous standards for nearly everything, including services.  The [[Deutsches Institut für Normung|DIN]] and [[Japanese Industrial Standards|JIS]] enable anyone to evaluate whether or not an article has been properly produced.  There is no such standard in the U.S., except for some scattered attempts by insurers to control electrical quality (such as [[UL (safety organization)|UL]]). Engineering standards, such as [[ASME]] and [[ASTM]]; Automotive, such as [[Automotive Service Excellence|ASE]] and [[ISO]] are not effective standards and do not compare with JIS or DIN because it is self-imposed, self-regulated, and self-inspected by the very people it is designed to regulate.

Makers of price indexes can address the quality bias problem with several steps. The main approach is to use [[hedonic index]] methods to capture attributes of products and their implicit prices:&lt;ref&gt;National Research Council. 2002. At What Price?: Conceptualizing and Measuring Cost-of-Living and Price Indexes. Washington, DC: The National Academies Press. https://doi.org/10.17226/10131.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The Advisory Commission To Study The Consumer Price Index (aka the [[Boskin Commission]]). 1996.  [http://www.ssa.gov/history/reports/boskinrpt.html Toward A More Accurate Measure Of The Cost Of Living] (html), also released as  [https://www.finance.senate.gov/imo/media/doc/Prt104-72.pdf Final Report of the Advisory Commission to Study the Consumer Price Index] (pdf).&lt;/ref&gt;

* Use matching models to relate goods from one period to the next
* Gather data on the attributes of goods and use [[hedonic regression]]s to infer implicit prices for these attributes and the net change in price for a good whose attributes have changed.

==Spelling==
The spelling "queueing" over "queuing" is typically encountered in the academic research field. In fact, one of the flagship journals of the profession is named ''[[Queueing Systems]]''.

== Single queueing nodes ==
Single queueing nodes are usually described using [[Kendall's notation]] in the form ''A''/''S''/''C'' where ''A'' describes the time between arrivals to the queue, ''S'' the size of jobs and ''C'' the number of servers at the node.&lt;ref name="tijms"&gt;Tijms, H.C, ''Algorithmic Analysis of Queues", Chapter 9 in  A First Course in Stochastic Models, Wiley, Chichester, 2003&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Kendall | first1 = D.

Markov, Extension of the law of large numbers to dependent quantities, Izvestiia Fiz.-Matem. Obsch. Kazan Univ., (2nd Ser.), 15(1906), pp. 135&amp;ndash;156 [Also [37], pp.
339&amp;ndash;361].&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1909, [[Agner Krarup Erlang]], a Danish engineer who worked for the Copenhagen Telephone Exchange, published the first paper on what would now be called queueing theory.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://pass.maths.org.uk/issue2/erlang/index.html |title=Agner Krarup Erlang (1878 - 1929) &amp;#124; plus.maths.org |publisher=Pass.maths.org.uk |accessdate=2013-04-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Asmussen | first1 = S.

* M stands for Markov or memoryless and means arrivals occur according to a Poisson process
* D stands for deterministic and means jobs arriving at the queue which require a fixed amount of service
* ''k'' describes the number of servers at the queueing node (''k'' = 1, 2,...). If there are more jobs at the node than there are servers, then jobs will queue and wait for service

The [[M/M/1 queue]] is a simple model where a single server serves jobs that arrive according to a Poisson process and have [[exponentially distributed]] service requirements. In an [[M/G/1 queue]], the G stands for general and indicates an arbitrary [[probability distribution]]. The M/G/1 model was solved by [[Felix Pollaczek]] in 1930,&lt;ref&gt;Pollaczek, F., Ueber eine Aufgabe der Wahrscheinlichkeitstheorie, Math. Z. 1930&lt;/ref&gt; a solution later recast in probabilistic terms by [[Aleksandr Khinchin]] and now known as the [[Pollaczek–Khinchine formula]].&lt;ref name="century" /&gt;&lt;ref name="century1" /&gt;

A common basic queuing system is attributed to [[Erlang distribution|Erlang]], though its exact origin remains unclear. The queue refers to a single server with one demand rate (&lt;math display="inline"&gt;\delta&lt;/math&gt;), one dropout rate (&lt;math display="inline"&gt;\mu&lt;/math&gt;), and one rate of service (&lt;math display="inline"&gt;\sigma&lt;/math&gt;), for which the length of the queue ''L'' is defined as:

&lt;math&gt;L=\frac{\delta-\sigma}{\mu}
&lt;/math&gt;

Assuming an exponential distribution for the rates, the waiting time ''W'' can be defined as the proportion of demand that is served. This is equal to the exponential survival rate of those who do not drop out over the waiting period, giving:

&lt;math&gt;\frac{\sigma}{\delta} = e^{-W{\mu}}
&lt;/math&gt;

The second equation is commonly rewritten as:

&lt;math&gt;W = \frac{1}{\mu}ln\frac{\delta}{\mu}
&lt;/math&gt;

The two-stage one-box model is common in epidemiology.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Hernández-Suarez|first=Carlos|date=2010|title=An application of queuing theory to SIS and SEIS epidemic models|url=|journal=Math. Biosci.|volume=7|pages=809–823|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Queueing networks==
Networks of queues are systems in which a number of queues are connected by what's known as customer routing. When a customer is serviced at one node it can join another node and queue for service, or leave the network.

For networks of ''m'' nodes, the state of the system can be described by an ''m''–dimensional vector (''x''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;,''x''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;,...,''x''&lt;sub&gt;''m''&lt;/sub&gt;) where ''x''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt; represents the number of customers at each node.

The simplest non-trivial network of queues is called [[Jackson network|tandem queues]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.stats.ox.ac.uk/~winkel/bs3a07l13-14.pdf#page=4&lt;/ref&gt; The first significant results in this area were [[Jackson network]]s,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Jackson | first1 = J.

P_0=\frac{1}{1+\sum_{n=1}^{\infty}\prod_{i=0}^

&lt;/math&gt;

===Routing algorithms===
In discrete time networks where there is a constraint on which service nodes can be active at any time, the max-weight scheduling algorithm chooses a service policy to give optimal throughput in the case that each job visits only a single person &lt;ref name="Manuel" /&gt;service node. In the more general case where jobs can visit more than one node, [[backpressure routing]] gives optimal throughput. A [[network scheduler]] must choose a [[queuing algorithm]], which affects the characteristics of the larger network{{citation needed|date=August 2017}}. See also [[Stochastic scheduling]] for more about scheduling of queueing systems.

==Mean field limits==
[[Mean field model]]s consider the limiting behaviour of the [[empirical measure]] (proportion of queues in different states) as the number of queues (''m'' above) goes to infinity. The impact of other queues on any given queue in the network is approximated by a differential equation. The deterministic model converges to the same stationary distribution as the original model.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | last1 = Bobbio | first1 = A. | last2 = Gribaudo | first2 = M. | last3 = Telek | first3 = M.

==Fluid limits==
{{main article|fluid limit}}
Fluid models are continuous deterministic analogs of queueing networks obtained by taking the limit when the process is scaled in time and space, allowing heterogeneous objects. This scaled trajectory converges to a deterministic equation which allows the stability of the system to be proven. It is known that a queueing network can be stable, but have an unstable fluid limit.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Bramson | first1 = M. | title = A stable queueing network with unstable fluid model | doi = 10.1214/aoap/1029962815 | journal = The Annals of Applied Probability | volume = 9 | issue = 3 | pages = 818 | year = 1999 | jstor = 2667284| pmid =  | pmc = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Heavy traffic/diffusion approximations==
{{Main article|heavy traffic approximation}}
In a system with high occupancy rates (utilisation near 1) a heavy traffic approximation can be used to approximate the queueing length process by a [[reflected Brownian motion]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Chen | first1 = H. | last2 = Whitt | first2 = W. | doi = 10.1007/BF01149260 | title = Diffusion approximations for open queueing networks with service interruptions | journal = [[Queueing Systems]]| volume = 13 | issue = 4 | pages = 335 | year = 1993 | pmid =  | pmc = }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Ornstein–Uhlenbeck process]] or more general [[diffusion process]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Yamada | first1 = K. | title = Diffusion Approximation for Open State-Dependent Queueing Networks in the Heavy Traffic Situation | doi = 10.1214/aoap/1177004602 | journal = The Annals of Applied Probability | volume = 5 | issue = 4 | pages = 958 | year = 1995 | jstor = 2245101| pmid =  | pmc = }}&lt;/ref&gt; The number of dimensions of the RBM is equal to the number of queueing nodes and the diffusion is restricted to the non-negative [[orthant]].

''Managerial Accounting 12th Edition'' (p. 578) New York, NY: McGraw-Hill/Irwin. {{ISBN|978-0-07-352670-6}}.&lt;/ref&gt; is a cost that differs between alternatives being considered.&lt;ref&gt;Williams, Jan R., Haka, Susan F., Bettner, Mark S., Meigs, Robert F.

''Financial and Managerial Accounting: The Basis for Business Decisions'' (p. 848) New York, NY: McGraw-Hill/Irwin. {{ISBN|0-07-239688-1}}.&lt;/ref&gt;  In order for a cost to be a relevant cost it must be:
*Future
*Cash Flow
*Incremental

It is often important for businesses to distinguish between relevant and irrelevant costs when analyzing alternatives because erroneously considering irrelevant costs can lead to unsound business decisions.&lt;ref name="garrison578"/&gt;  Also, ignoring irrelevant data in analysis can save time and effort.

Types of ''irrelevant'' costs are:&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.accountingtools.com/questions-and-answers/what-is-an-irrelevant-cost.html Accounting Tools: What is an irrelevant cost?]&lt;/ref&gt;

* Committed costs

== Example ==
A construction firm is in the middle of constructing an office building, having spent $1 million on it so far.  It requires an additional $0.5 million to complete construction.  Because of a downturn in the [[real estate market]], the finished building will not fetch its original intended price, and is expected to sell for only $1.2 million.  If, in deciding whether or not to continue construction, the $1 million sunk cost were incorrectly included in the analysis, the firm may conclude that it should abandon the project because it would be spending $1.5 million for a return of $1.2 million.  However, the $1 million is an irrelevant cost, and should be excluded.  Continuing the construction actually involves spending $0.5 million for a return of $1.2 million, which makes it the correct course of action.

A managerial accounting term for costs that are specific to management's decisions. The concept of relevant costs eliminates unnecessary data that could complicate the decision-making process.

==Biography==
He was born in 1804 in [[Jamaica Plain, Boston|Jamaica Plain, Boston, Massachusetts]], son of [[Ralph Bennet Forbes]] and Margaret Perkins, and brother of [[John Murray Forbes]].&lt;ref name=obit/&gt;

On October 19, 1817 at age 13 he joined the crew of the ''Canton Packet'' and made his first voyage to China. He arrived in [[Guangzhou|Canton, China]] in March 1818 using the eastern route. In June 1818, he returned to [[Boston]].&lt;ref name=cutter/&gt;

In 1819 he made a second voyage aboard the ''Canton Packet''. On his next voyage he was promoted to third mate, he became second mate in 1821, and in 1825 was promoted to [[ship's master]].&lt;ref name=cutter/&gt;

Aboard the ''Nile'' he sailed for [[Manila]]. Previous to this time he had been ship's master of the ''Levant''. He became a full captain before he was 20 years old. From Manila the ''Nile'' went to China, then to California, and from there to [[Buenos Aires, Argentina]].

In 1828 he sailed the ''Danube'' for [[Sturgis &amp; Perkins]] on a trading voyage to [[Smyrna, Turkey]], and other European ports. He later was captain of the ''[[Niantic (whaling vessel)|Niantic]].''&lt;ref name=cutter/&gt;

About 1832 he made his last voyage to China and in 1840 became head of [[Russell &amp; Company]], the largest American commercial house in China. Of his large means he made generous provision for his mother and younger brother. He visited China several times and became the American vice consul at [[Guangzhou|Canton]].&lt;ref name=cutter&gt;{{Cite book

In 1834 he married Rose Greene Smith and they had three children: Robert Bennet Forbes (1837-1891),  Edith Forbes who married Charles Eliot Perkins, and James Murray Forbes (1845-1885).&lt;ref name=cutter/&gt;

In 1841 he witnessed the [[Battle of Kowloon]] between the [[Qing dynasty|Qing Dynasty]] and the [[British Empire]] from aboard his rowboat.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/41977280|title=The India-China opium trade in the nineteenth century|last=1940-|first=Janin, Hunt,|date=1999|publisher=McFarland|isbn=0786407158|oclc=41977280}} pg. 116&lt;/ref&gt;

==Ships==
Captain Forbes owned or was involved in the construction of approximately seventy vessels.

His first ship was the ''Lintin'', a 390-ton bark built by Sprague and James in Medford, Mass., in 1830.  Forbes owned the ''Lintin'' from 1830–1832, after which time she sailed in Chinese waters.&lt;ref name = cutter /&gt;&lt;ref name = gleason &gt;

&lt;/ref&gt; Forbes also owned the ''[[Paul Jones (1843 ship)|Paul Jones]]'', which took the first cargo of ice to China. "During the Civil War he was employed as a volunteer by the government to inspect the building of nine gunboats and at the same time built for himself and others the ''Meteor,'' of 1500 tons."&lt;ref name = "cutter" /&gt;

==Forbes rig==
The [[clipper|clipper ship]] ''[[Great Republic]]'' was originally rigged with Forbes' double [[topsail]] [[Yard (sailing)|yards]].&lt;ref name = "bruzelius"&gt;

The Forbes rig was also well received on the ''Mermaid,'' as this 1852 excerpt from the "Boston Atlas" transcribed by Bruzelius shows:
{{quote|THE ''CLIPPER [[barque|BARQUE]] MERMAID'', Captain Smith, recently arrived, made the passage from Canton to New York in 87 days. The telegraph, when she arrived, reported Capt. Forbes as her commander, instead, no doubt of stating that she had Forbes's rig. This rig is working its way slowly into favor with ship-owners, and when its advantages are known, it will soon be universally adopted. It is the proper rig for large clippers ... The ''Mermaid'' ... has tested it in a voyage around the world, and like other vessels with it, has sailed with less men, than if she had been rigged in the usual style.&lt;ref&gt;

However, the Forbes rig was publicly rejected by the captain of the ''[[N.B. Palmer (clipper)|N.B. Palmer]]'' in 1855, in favor of the Howe rig.&lt;ref&gt;

==Legacy==
He built a [[Greek Revival]] mansion for his mother in [[Milton, Massachusetts]], designed by [[Isaiah Rogers]] (1833), that is now the [[Captain Robert Bennet Forbes House]] Museum.

{{quote|Captain Forbes was a member and an officer of the [[Humane Society of the United States|Massachusetts Humane Society]], one of the Boston pilot commissioners, member of the government of the Board of Trade, one of the vestry of [[King's Chapel]], member of the Boston Port Society, and at one time and another a director of various railroad and insurance companies.&lt;ref name = "cutter" /&gt;}}

Captain Forbes was awarded the medal of the Liverpool Shipwreck and Humane Society in 1849 for gallant conduct. The Cunard steamship ''[[RMS America Class#Europa|Europa]]'', on which Forbes was a passenger, ran down and sank an emigrant ship, ''Charles Bartlett''. Forbes jumped from the bulwarks of the ''Europa'' into the water and rescued first a woman and child, and then a man.&lt;ref name = "cutter" /&gt;

In 1852 he was one of the founders and first president of the [[Sailors' Snug Harbor of Boston]], a retirement home for "decrepit, infirm or aged sailors".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.masshist.org/findingaids/doc.cfm?fa=fa0205 Sailors' Snug Harbor of Boston Records, 1852-1975] at the Massachusetts Historical Society&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4282">'''Securities and Exchange Board of India (Alternative Investment Funds) Regulations, 2012''' (also called '''AIF Regulations''') are a set of regulations introduced by [[Securities and Exchange Board of India]] (SEBI) in 2012, to regulate [[pooled investment]] funds in [[India]], such as [[real estate]], [[private equity]] and [[hedge fund]]s.&lt;ref name=HinduPermts&gt;{{cite news|title=SEBI permits 123 alternative investment funds to operate in India|url=http://www.thehindubusinessline.com/markets/sebi-permits-123-alternative-investment-funds-to-operate-in-india/article6651625.ece|accessdate=17 April 2015|work=[[The Hindu Business Line]]|date=1 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Summary==
These regulations apply to all pooled investment funds registered in India which received capital from Indian or foreign investors.&lt;ref name=HinduPermts/&gt; These were made to regulated funds that were not covered under the [[Securities and Exchange Board Of India (Mutual Funds) Regulations, 1996|SEBI (Mutual Funds) Regulations, 1996]];  SEBI (Custodian Of Securities) Regulations, 1996 and any other regulations of SEBI.&lt;ref name="S."&gt;{{cite book|author=Pratap Giri S.|title=Investment Banking|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ua2tAAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT233|accessdate=17 April 2015|publisher=Tata McGraw-Hill Education|isbn=978-1-259-05872-1|page=233}}&lt;/ref&gt; This was introduced to bring unregistered funds in India under the ambit of law. Prior to the introduction of this, many funds were operating in India that could not be classified as domestic [[venture capital]] funds (VCF), foreign venture capital investors (FVCI) or  foreign [[institutional investor]] (FII).&lt;ref name="S."/&gt; After introduction of these regulations in July 2012, 123 entities registered themselves by November 2014.&lt;ref name=HinduPermts/&gt;

The Alternative Investment Funds (AIFs) have been categorised into three classes:

* ''Category I'': These funds receive incentives from the government, SEBI or other regulating agencies. These include [[Social venture capital|social venture fund]]s, [[Infrastructure debt|infrastructure fund]]s, [[Venture capital|venture capital fund]]s and [[SME finance|SME fund]]s.&lt;ref name=HinduPermts/&gt;
* ''Category II'': These funds are allowed to invest anywhere in any combination, but cannot take debts, except for day-to-day operation purposes. These include [[private equity]] funds and [[Bond fund|debt funds]].&lt;ref name=HinduPermts/&gt;&lt;ref name="S."/&gt;
* ''Category III'': Funds that make short-term investments and then sell, like [[hedge fund]]s, come under this.&lt;ref name=HinduPermts/&gt;

AIFs are usually marketed towards high-worth persons. The minimum investment from one person is {{Currency|10000000|INR}}. The minimum corpus of the funds is {{currency|200000000|INR}}. At any time, not more than 1000 investors are allowed. The initial contribution of the [[Investment management|fund manager]] or [[Corporate promoter|promoter]] should less than 2.5% or {{currency|50000000|INR}}, whichever is less.&lt;ref name=Dejargoned&gt;{{cite news|title=De-jargoned: Alternative investment funds|url=http://www.livemint.com/Money/WMWedyfbu45PPubMcUURyN/Dejargoned-Alternative-investment-funds.html|accessdate=17 April 2015|work=[[Live Mint]]|date=4 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[2015 Union budget of India]], it was announced that [[foreign direct investment]]s (FDI) would be allowed in AIFs. It was also announced that the tax liability will be shifted from the funds to the investors in Category I and Category II.&lt;ref name=FDi&gt;{{cite news|title=Govt to allow FDI in alternative investment funds|url=http://www.thehindubusinessline.com/economy/budget/govt-to-allow-fdi-in-alternative-investment-funds/article6946169.ece|accessdate=17 April 2015|work=[[The Hindu Business Line]]|date=28 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Japanese name| Iwanami}}
{{nihongo|'''Shigeo Iwanami'''|岩波茂雄|Iwanami Shigeo|extra=27 August 1881 – 25 April 1946}} was a publisher in the early [[Shōwa period]] [[Empire of Japan|Japan]], and founder of [[Iwanami Shoten]].

==Biography==
Iwanami was born in what is now part of [[Suwa, Nagano]], into a farming family. His father was a village headman, but he died when Iwanami was age 15, and Iwanami was raised by his mother. With the assistance of Shigetake Sugiura, he completed high school in [[Tokyo]]. A friend of [[Misao Fujimura]], he was so overcome by the latter’s suicide that he withdrew to a mountain hut at [[Lake Nojiri]] for 49 days, contemplating suicide himself, until his mother came to get him.

Iwanami entered [[Tokyo Imperial University]] in 1905, where he became interested in the teachings of [[Uchimura Kanzō]], although he never converted to Christianity. He married in 1906, and graduated from the Department of Philosophy in 1908. After graduation, Iwanami worked as an instructor at the Kanda Upper Women’s School, and at the Tokyo Women's School of Gymnastics and Music. Inspired by [[Leo Tolstoy]], Iwanami was convinced that women need to receive an education equal to that of men. Also, during this period, he established a literary circle with his close friend, [[Yoshishige Abe]] and held weekly meetings in his home with leading authors to discuss intellectual matters.&lt;ref name=Hardacre&gt;''New Directions in the Study of Meiji Japan'', page 148-150&lt;/ref&gt;
In 1913, Iwanami opened a used book store and publishing house, [[Iwanami Shoten]], in [[Jinbōchō, Tokyo]], with the idea that he could use this as a start to begin publishing and disseminating works which he felt to be of intellectual value, and quit his teaching job to devote his full energy into the venture. The following year, he assisted [[Natsume Sōseki]] in publishing ''[[Kokoro]]'', launching both Natsume’s career as a novelist and his own career as a publisher. Even after Natsume Sōseki died in 1916, ongoing revenues from the publication of his works provided Iwanami with the funding necessary to proceed with numerous projects. This included the translation into Japanese and publication of the works of most European philosophers of the 19th and early 20th centuries, including [[Immanuel Kant]], [[Hegel]] and [[Karl Marx]].&lt;ref name=Hardacre/&gt;

In the 1920s and 1930s, Iwanami concentrated on publishing both scientific works and works of philosophy, as well as attempting to popularize the Japanese classics and new authors, calling his selection the “Iwanami Culture”. He also published a paperback series in order to make his prices affordable to students.&lt;ref name=Hardacre/&gt; From late 1927 to early 1928, he toured [[Manchuria]] and [[north China]] as a guest of the [[South Manchurian Railway]], together with [[Kiyoshi Miki]] .&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Townsend  | first =  Susan | coauthors = | year = 2009| title = Miki Kiyoshi, 1897-1945: Japan's Itinerant Philosopher| publisher =  Brill | location = | isbn = 9004175822 - }} pages 222-224&lt;/ref&gt; During the interwar period, Iwanami developed such close ties with academics in Kyoto and Tokyo that his company enjoyed an almost complete monopoly on academic publishing in Japan.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Buckley  | first =  Sandra | coauthors = | year = 2006| title = Encyclopaedia of Contemporary Japanese Culture| publisher =  Routledge | location = | isbn = 0415143446 }} pages 222-224&lt;/ref&gt; However, he drew the wrath of Japanese militarists by publicly denouncing the [[Second Sino-Japanese War]] as “a war Japan should not be involved in,” and in 1940 he drew unfavorable attention again by publishing works by [[Sokichi Tsuda]] that questioned the veracity of Japan’s historical antecedents as described in the ''[[Kojiki]]'' and ''[[Nihon Shoki]]''. Iwanami was arrested in 1942, but acquitted in 1944.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Sakamoto  | first =  Taro | coauthors = | year = 2011| title = The Six National Histories of Japan| publisher =  UBC Press | location = | isbn = 0774842962 }} pages xxiv&lt;/ref&gt;

Iwanami was appointed to a seat in the [[House of Peers (Japan)|House of Peers]] in the [[Diet of Japan]] in 1945, as one of the highest taxpayers in Japan. He was awarded the [[Order of Culture]] by the Japanese government in 1946.  He died of an [[intracranial hemorrhage]] in July that year. His grave is at the temple of [[Tokei-ji]] in [[Kamakura, Kanagawa|Kamakura]].

'''Shmuel "Samy" Flatto-Sharon''' ({{lang-he-n|שמואל פלאטו-שרון}}, born 18 January 1930) is a controversial [[France|French]]-[[Israel]]i businessman, radio talk-show host and former politician who was a member of the [[Knesset]] between 1977 and 1981.

==Biography==
Flatto-Sharon was born as '''Shmuel Sheibitz''' to a Jewish family in [[Łódź]], [[Poland]] in 1930. His family escaped to France after the [[German invasion of Poland]], with Shmuel disguised as a girl.&lt;ref&gt;[http://fr.jpost.com/servlet/Satellite?cid=1159193370598&amp;pagename=JPArticle%2FShowFull One on One with Flatto-Sharon: Broadcast Zionism] The Jerusalem Post, 4 October 2006&lt;/ref&gt; Forty members of his family, including his father, died in the [[The Holocaust|Holocaust]]. He attended high school in [[Paris]] and [[Strasbourg]], and joined the [[Mouvement Jeunes Communistes de France|Young Communist League]] in 1945.

At age 14, he began selling cigarettes to soldiers and students, and then entered the recycling business, making a fortune in the recycling of paper, rags, and scrap metal. At age 21, he entered the real estate business. Throughout his 20s, Sharon built up his business empire. He came to own a transport service for hauling merchandise with dozens of trucks, industrial plants, a chain of restaurants and cafes, and hotels.&lt;ref name=hayom&gt;http://www.israelhayom.co.il/site/newsletter_article.php?id=25609&lt;/ref&gt; By the late 1960s, he owned dozens of companies throughout Europe, the [[United States]], and [[South America]], and did business in oil, logging, and precious metals in [[Africa]].

==Emigration to Israel==
In 1975 he made [[aliyah]] to Israel, fleeing the French authorities as he was wanted for embezzling $60 million.&lt;ref name=NYT&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/1984/06/28/world/israel-court-orders-candidate-to-begin-a-bribery-jail-term.html?n=Top%2fReference%2fTimes%20Topics%2fSubjects%2fE%2fEthics Israel Court Orders Candidate To Begin a Bribery Jail Term] New York Times, 28 June 1984&lt;/ref&gt; He bought a villa in [[Savyon]] and immediately launched a business career in Israel. He entered a partnership with Israeli businessman Avraham Pilz, with whom he established the [[Dizengoff Center]], which was Israel's first shopping mall. 

==Israeli political career==
Despite barely speaking Hebrew, in 1977 he formed a one-man [[List of political parties in Israel|party]], also named [[Development and Peace (political party)|Flatto-Sharon]], to run in the [[Israeli legislative election, 1977|Knesset elections]] that year, hoping to obtain parliamentary immunity to avoid extradition to France.&lt;ref name=FS&gt;[http://www.flattosharon.co.il/BRING%20BACK%20FLATTO-SHARON.html Bring Back Flatto-Sharon] Shmuel Flatto-Sharon&lt;/ref&gt;

The list won 2% of the vote, enough for two seats. However, as it was a one-man list, only one seat was taken.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.knesset.gov.il/description/eng/eng_mimshal_res9.htm Ninth Knesset] Knesset website&lt;/ref&gt; It has been suggested that the surprising level of support that the party won was a response to France's refusal to extradite [[Abu Daoud]], who was wanted in Israel for the [[Munich massacre]].&lt;ref name=FS/&gt;

Once ensconced in the [[Knesset]], Flatto-Sharon joined [[Menachem Begin]]'s coalition, with one of his first acts being to vote in favour of a law that prohibited the extradition of Israeli citizens.&lt;ref name=FS/&gt; He sat on the Economic Affairs Committee and in 1978 he renamed the party ''Development and Peace''.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.knesset.gov.il/faction/eng/FactionHistoryAll_eng.asp Mergers and Splits Among Parliamentary Groups] Knesset website&lt;/ref&gt; During his Knesset term he was involved in negotiations to free Israeli [[Prisoner of war|POWs]].&lt;ref name=FS/&gt; The party ran in the [[Israeli legislative election, 1981|1981]] and [[Israeli legislative election, 1984|1984 elections]], but did not pass the [[Election threshold|electoral threshold]] of 1% in either, and subsequently disappeared. Flatto-Sharon was never extradited to France to serve the five-year sentence given to him in his absence, as the five-year statute of limitations had expired.

In 1984 he was sentenced to three months community service for bribery during the 1977 election campaign. It had emerged that he had "bought votes in 1977 by promising apartments to young couples and homes to others at reduced prices" as well as paying voters (who were described as "campaign workers") and giving money to a local party in [[Dimona]] to be associated with his party. His community service was performed in a state agency in Tel Aviv.&lt;ref name=NYT/&gt;

==Later life==
After losing his seat in the Knesset in 1981, he returned to private business. He and his wife Annette became celebrities known for hosting parties in their luxury villa in Savyon, with businessmen and other celebrities attending. The French government continued to maintain an international arrest warrant for him, and due to this, he rarely left Israel. In the early 1990s, after learning that he no longer had an [[Interpol]] warrant out for his arrest, Sharon flew to [[Italy]] on a business trip, and was arrested upon arrival in [[Rome]]. Facing possible extradition to France, he escaped back to Israel disguised as a woman. Sharon eventually paid a large fine to settle his criminal case with the French authorities.&lt;ref name=hayom/&gt;

Flatto-Sharon is now an established multi-millionaire and works as a radio talk-show host; his show, named ''Flatto Bli Heshbon'' (Flatto without accountability) is broadcast on numerous stations, including Radius 100, Lev HaMedina, Radio Haifa and Radio Darom FM.&lt;ref&gt;[http://flattosharon.co.il/sommaire-US.htm Biography] Shmuel Flatto-Sharon&lt;/ref&gt; He has been married three times, and has two children. His daughter Hilda is a homeopathic doctor, and his son Yoav is a businessman.&lt;ref name=hayom/&gt;

'''Stress in the aviation industry''' is a common phenomenon composed of three sources: [[Physiology|physiological]] stressors, [[psychological]] stressors, and [[Environmental causes of aviation stress|environmental]] stressors.&lt;ref name="how"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Hansen|first1=Fawne|title=How Do Airline Pilots Cope With Stress?|url=https://adrenalfatiguesolution.com/pilots-and-stress/|website=The Adrenal Fatigue Solution|publisher=Perfect Health|accessdate=22 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Professional pilots can experience stress in flight, on the ground during work-related activities, and during personal time because of the influence of their occupation.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;Harris, Don, Professor.

Retrieved 1 December 2015, from &lt;&lt;nowiki&gt;http://www.myilibrary.com?ID=317410&lt;/nowiki&gt;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; An airline pilot can be an extremely stressful job due to the workload, responsibilities and safety of the thousands of passengers they transport around the world. Chronic levels of stress can negatively impact one's health, [[job performance]] and cognitive functioning.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Being exposed to stress does not always negatively influence humans because it can motivate people to improve and help them adapt to a new environment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Jaret|first1=Peter|title=The Surprising Benefits Of Stress|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/the-surprising-benefits-of-stress_5626e8fee4b08589ef49a820|accessdate=18 November 2015|publisher=Huffpost Healthy Living|date=20 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Unfortunate accidents start to occur when a pilot is under excessive stress, as it dramatically affects his or her physical, emotional, and mental conditions.

== Aviation accidents caused by stress ==
[[File:NTSBAsiana214TailWreckage.jpg|thumb|246x246px|[[Asiana Airlines Flight 214]] tail wreckage due to the crash]]
[[Asiana Airlines Flight 214]] was one of many tragic accidents triggered by stress. It occurred on July 6, 2013 on the aircraft's final approach to [[San Francisco International Airport]] from [[Incheon International Airport]]. During its approach, the plane hit the edge of the runway and its tail came apart followed by the fuselage bursting into flames. The trainee pilot flying was "stressed about the approach to the unfamiliar airport and thought the autothrottle was working before the jet came in too low and too slow."&lt;ref name =Asiana&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Chow|first1=Stephanie|last2=Yortsos|first2=Stephen|last3=Meshkati|first3=Najmedin|title=Investigating Cockpit Automation and Culture Issues in Aviation Safety|journal=Aviation Psychology and Applied Human Factors|date=2014|volume=4|issue=2|pages=113–121|doi=10.1027/2192-0923/a000066}}&lt;/ref&gt; He believed that the [[autothrottle]], which is designed to maintain speed, was always on. The trainee pilot should have had full understanding of his flight systems and high mode awareness, but he didn't. He told [[National Transportation Safety Board]] that he should have studied more. His inefficient knowledge of the flight deck automation and an unfamiliar airport structure caused excessive stress, and the aftermath was disastrous: three passengers died and more than 187 passengers were injured.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Martinez|first1=Michael|title=A year later, survivors recall Asiana Flight 214 crash|url=http://www.cnn.com/2014/07/06/us/california-asiana-plane-crash-anniversary/|accessdate=28 November 2015|publisher=CNN|date=6 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:2010 Polish Air Force Tu-154 crash 002.jpg|thumb|246x246px|[[2010 Polish Air Force Tu-154 crash|Polish Air Force Tu-154]] crash site]]
[[American Airlines Flight 1420]] took place on June 1, 1999. The pilot was Captain Richard Buschmann, considered an expert pilot with over ten thousand hours of flight time. The [[First officer (aeronautics)|First Officer]] was Michael Origel with under five thousand hours of flight time. The flight was set to land at the airport in Arkansas but a major thunderstorm was occurring in the area and Captain Buschmann decided to change runways due to the high crosswind and rapid change wind direction. The pilots were overcome with tasks and the stress of the difficult landing, forgetting to arm the automatic ground spoiler and ground braking systems.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.ntsb.gov/investigations/AccidentReports/Reports/AAR0102.pdf|title = Runway Overrun During Landing American Airlines Flight 1420|date = June 1999|accessdate = |website = Aircraft Accident Report|publisher = National Transportation Safety Board|last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt; It was too difficult to recover the aircraft and it slid off the runway and collided with a large steel walkway, resulting in the death of Captain Bucshmann and 10 passengers, with many suffering from severe injuries.

Another example is the [[2010 Polish Air Force Tu-154 crash|Polish Air Force Tu-154 crash]] of April 2010, which killed Polish president [[Lech Kaczyński|Lech Kaczynski]]. During landing, the pilot Captain Arkadiusz Protasiuk was having difficulty landing due to severely foggy conditions, but the number of high-status passengers and priority of arriving on time pressured him onwards. Captain Protasiuk brought the aircraft down through the clouds at too low of an altitude, resulting in a [[controlled flight into terrain]]. His attempt to land failed and the plane crashed into a forest, killing the crew and all the passengers. Further study by the [[Interstate Aviation Committee]] regarding the cockpits voice recordings revealed that there was never a direct command for the pilot to go through with the landing, but the report did show that the pilot was under a "cascade of stress much of it emanating from his powerful passengers, as Captain Protasiuk slipped below the decision altitude".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title = Polish Crash’s Causes: Pilot Error and Stress, Report Says|url = https://www.nytimes.com/2011/01/13/world/europe/13crash.html|newspaper = The New York Times|date = 2011-01-12|access-date = 2015-12-02|issn = 0362-4331|first = Ellen|last = Barry}}&lt;/ref&gt; This accident led to the death of 96 people, all due to the high amount of stress being put on the pilot, affecting his mental state, inhibiting him from doing his job.

=== Advances In cockpit technology ===
From the [[Asiana Airlines Flight 214]] study, Kathy Abbott of the [[Federal Aviation Administration]] stated that "the data suggests that the highly integrated nature of current flight decks and additional add-on features have increased flight crew knowledge and introduced complexity that sometimes results in pilot confusion and errors during flight deck operation."&lt;ref name =Asiana /&gt; U.S. investigators instructed the manufactures to fix Boeing 777's complex control systems because pilots "no longer fully understand" how aircraft systems works.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Withnall|first1=Adam|title=Asiana Airlines flight 214 crash caused by Boeing planes being 'overly complicated'|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/asiana-airlines-flight-214-crash-caused-by-boeing-planes-being-overly-complicated-9562331.html|accessdate=28 November 2015|publisher=Independent|date=25 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; As technology advances, more and more new instruments are put into the cockpit panel. As these increase, cognitive demands also increase, and pilots are becoming distracted from their primary tasks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Leung|first1=Ying|last2=Morris|first2=Charles|title=Pilot mental workload: how well do pilots really perform|journal=Ergonomics|date=15 December 2006|volume=49|issue=15|pages=1581–1596|pmid=17090505|doi=10.1080/00140130600857987}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although having various types of information enhances [[situation awareness]], it also overloads sensory channels.&lt;ref name= "cite" /&gt; Since human's cognitive loads are limited, information overloads only increase the risk of flight accidents. Pilots have more difficulty perceiving and processing the data when information are overwhelming.&lt;ref name="blood" /&gt;

== Effects on memory ==
[[File:Working memory model.svg|left|thumb|209x209px|Model of [[working memory]]]]
There are three components of memory: [[Long-term memory|long-term]], [[Short-term memory|short-term]], and [[working memory]]. When stress kicks in, a pilot’s working memory is impaired. Stress either limits the amount of resources that can be accessed through working memory or the time which these sources can be accessed are inhibited.&lt;ref name="Nicholas" /&gt; When a pilot feels stressed, he or she will notice an increase in heart rate, higher blood pressure, muscle tensions, anxiety and fatigue.&lt;ref name="blood"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Keränen|first1=Heikki|last2=Huttunen|first2=Kerttu|last3=Väyrynen|first3=Eero|title=Effect of cognitive load on speech prosody in aviation|journal=Applied Ergonomics|date=17 August 2010|volume=42|issue=2|pages=348–357|pmid=20832770|doi=10.1016/j.apergo.2010.08.005}}&lt;/ref&gt; These physiological stress symptoms eventually interrupt the pilot’s cognitive functions by reducing his or her memory capacity and restraining cue samples. Through a study researchers found that stress greatly affects flight performances including, smoothness and accuracy of landing, ability to multi-task, and being ahead of the plane.&lt;ref name="Nicholas" /&gt; Further research shows that under high stress, people are likely to make the same decision he or she has previously made, whether or not it led to a positive or a negative consequence before.&lt;ref name="Nicholas" /&gt;

== Causes of stress ==
Stress can be caused by [[Environmental causes of aviation stress|environmental]], [[Physiology|physiological]], or [[psychological]] factors. Environmental stress can be caused by loud noise, small cockpit space, temperature, or any factors affecting one physically via one's current surroundings.&lt;ref name="how" /&gt; Unpleasant environments can raise one's stress level. Physiological stress is a physical change due to influence of fatigue, anxiety, hunger, or any factors that may change a pilot's biological rhythms.&lt;ref name="s"&gt;{{cite web|title=The effects of stress on pilot performance|url=http://www.pilotfriend.com/training/flight_training/human/stress.htm|website=Human Factor in Aviation|publisher=Pilotfriend|accessdate=28 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lastly, psychological factors include personal issues, including experiences, mental health, relationships and any other emotional issues a pilot may face.&lt;ref name="s" /&gt; All these stressors interfere with cognitive activity and limit a pilot's ability to achieve peak performance. It is important to minimize these possible sources of stress to maximize pilots' cognitive loads, which affects their perception, memory, and logical reasoning.&lt;ref name= "cite"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Hancock|last2=Weaver|title=On time distortion under stress|journal=Theoretical Issues in Ergonomics Science|date=April 2005|volume=6|issue=2|pages=193–211|doi=10.1080/14639220512331325747}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Stress in flight ==
[[File:Inverted u.jpg|thumb|227x227px|
[[Yerkes–Dodson law]] shows that too low or too high arousal results in low performance]]

Researchers found that improvements in technology have significantly reduced aviation accidents, but [[human error]] still endangers flight safety. An individual reacts to stress in different ways, depending on how one perceives stress.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Kowalski-Trakofler|first1=Kathleen|last2=Vaught|first2=Charles|title=Judgment and decision making under stress: an  overview for emergency managers|journal=Int. J. Emergency Management|date=2003|volume=1|issue=3|pages=278–289|doi=10.1504/ijem.2003.003297}}&lt;/ref&gt; If an individual judges that he or she has resources to cope with demands of the situation, it will be evaluated as a challenge. On the other hand, if an individual believes situational demands outweigh the resources, he or she will evaluate it as a [[threat]], leading to poorer performance. Under the threat response, researchers stated that pilots became more distracted with their controls and had higher tendencies to scan unnecessary instruments.&lt;ref name="stress"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Vine|first1=Samuel|last2=Uiga|first2=Liis|last3=Lavric|first3=Aureliu|last4=Moore|first4=Lee|last5=Tsaneva-Atanasova|first5=Krasimira|last6=Mark|first6=Wilson|title=Individual reactions to stress predict performance during a critical aviation incident|journal=Anxiety, Stress, &amp; Coping|date=2015|volume=28|issue=4|pages=467–477|doi=10.1080/10615806.2014.986722}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Plan Continuation Error (PCE) is one of the types of decision-making error pilot conducts. PCE is defined as an "erroneous behavior due to failure to revise a flight plan despite emerging evidence that suggests it is no longer safe."&lt;ref name="cognitive" /&gt; The [[French Land Transport Accident Investigation Bureau]] (BEA) stated that 41.5% of casualties in general aviation were caused by get-home-itis syndrome; which happens when a pilot intents to land at the planned destination, no matter what it takes.&lt;ref name="cognitive" /&gt;  A pilot must use their own judgment to go-around whenever it is necessary, but he or she often fails to do so. Through the study, it was found that mental workload of stress and heart rate increases when making go-around decisions. A pilot feels pressured and stressed by the obligation to get passengers to their destinations at the right time and to continue the flight as planned. When choosing between productivity and safety, pilots' risk assessments can be influenced unconsciously. [[American Airlines Flight 1420]] accidents was one example caused by PCE; although the flight crew knew it was dangerous to continue the flight as severe thunderstorms was approaching, they continued on with their flight.

=== Positive and negative views of stress ===
Stress can narrow the focus of attention in a good way and in a bad way. Stress helps to simplify a pilot's task and enables him or her to focus on major issues by eliminating nonessential information.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Cooper|first1=Maureen|title=Can stress ever be good for wellbeing?|url=http://www.actionforhappiness.org/news/can-stress-ever-be-good-for-wellbeing|accessdate=28 November 2015|publisher=Action For Happiness|date=18 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In other words, a pilot can simplify information and react accordingly to major [[Sensory cue|cues]] only. However, when a pilot exceeds his or her cognitive load, it will eventually narrow his or her attention too much and cause inattentiaon deafness.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Tracking pilots’ brains to reduce risk of human error|url=http://www.euronews.com/2015/05/26/tracking-pilots-brains-to-reduce-risk-of-human-error/|accessdate=28 November 2015|publisher=Euronews|date=26 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The pilot will mainly focus on doing the primary task and ignore secondary tasks, such as audible alarms and spoken instructions.

== Military pilot stress ==
Military pilots experience a more fast-paced and stressful career compared to airline and general aviation pilots. Military pilots experience significantly greater stress levels due to significant reliability and performance expectations.&lt;ref&gt;Ahmadi, K., &amp; Alireza, K. (2007). Stress and Job Satisfaction among Air Force Military Pilots.''Journal of Social Sciences,'' ''3''(3), 159-163. Retrieved November 17, 2015, from http://docsdrive.com/pdfs/sciencepublications/jssp/2007/159-163.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; They hold a unique position in the workforce that includes peak physical and mental condition, high intelligence and extensive training. All military pilots, at times, must work under extreme conditions, experiencing high levels of stress, especially in a war zone. Soldiers are made to  endure punishment and go through the most unthinkable situations. They are expected to continue with their job and at times completely ignore their own emotions. After initial training, the military completely reforms the individual, and in most cases incredible stress management skills are formed. The soldier is then sent off for further training, in this case to be a pilot, where they are tested and challenge even further to either fail or become one of the best.

Military pilots withhold a lot of responsibility. Their jobs can include passenger or cargo transport, reconnaissance missions, or attacking from the air or flight training, all while expected to be in perfect mental and physical condition. These job place a responsibility on the pilot to avoid mistakes as millions of dollars, lives, or whole operations are at risk. At times stress does over take the pilot&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url = https://www.familyforce.ca/sites/Valcartier/SiteCollectionDocuments/Guide-BSO_ANG.pdf|title = Signs of Operational Stress Injury|last = Kholer|first = Nadia|date = 2012|publisher= Valcartier Family Medical Centre|doi = |pmid = |access-date = }}&lt;/ref&gt; and emotions and human error can occur.
[[File:JAS-39 Gripen (CzAF) February 2014.jpg|thumb|Military fighter jet JAS-39 Gripen|left|240x240px]]
There are countless occurrences of pilots bombing allied forces in [[List of friendly fire incidents|friendly fire incidents]] out of error and having to live with the consequences.{{citation needed|date=December 2015}}

The stress of the job itself or of any mistake made can hugely affect one's life outside work. Millions of veterans struggle with [[Posttraumatic stress disorder|post-traumatic stress injuries]], unhealthy coping strategies such as alcohol or substance abuse&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url = http://pubs.niaaa.nih.gov/publications/arcr344/toc34_4.htm|title = Alcohol and Stress in the Military|last = Schumm|first = Jeremiah. A|date = 2004|journal = Military Trauma and Stress Related Disorders|doi = |pmid = |access-date = }}&lt;/ref&gt; and in the worst of cases, suicide, which is very common. Many studies and help programs&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url = http://ajp.psychiatryonline.org/doi/abs/10.1176/appi.ajp.162.9.1688|title = Suicide Among Regular-Duty Military Personnel: A Retrospective Case-Control Study of Occupation-Specific Risk Factors for Workplace Suicide|last = Mahon|first = Martin.

Stress overcomes even the strongest, most highly training pilots and can take the worst toll.

Everyone deals with stress in a different manner, but military pilots stand out on their own with unique stress reducing and problem solving skills. Their main strategy is to find the problem causing the stress and solve it immediately&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url = http://search.proquest.com/docview/617762395|title = An empirical assessment of stress-coping styles in military pilots.|last = Picano|first = James. J.|date = 1990|journal = Aviation, Space, and Environmental Medicine |volume=61 |issue=4 |pages=356–360|doi = |pmid = |access-date = }}&lt;/ref&gt; so that they do not have to move to a secondary option, which consumes time they do not have. This is what they are taught in flight school; a sensor goes off and they immediately fix the problem. The main problem appears when pilots are going high speed or undergoing complicated maneuvers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url = http://search.proquest.com/docview/26272972|title = Investigation of the specific workability of the military pilots in the hypergravitational stress.|last = Pandov, Dimitrov, Popandreeva|first = |date = 1996|journal = International Congress of Aviation and Space Medicine, 44th, Jerusalem, Israe|doi = |pmid = |access-date = }}&lt;/ref&gt; Most times they are moving much faster than a human could even think, leaving a lot of room for human error. When that error occurs, however big or small, they can take on immense guilt for any problems that were caused depending on their personality.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url = http://search.proquest.com/docview/622124959|title = Personality profiles and stress-coping strategies of slovenian military pilots|last = Meško|first = Maja|date = 2009|journal = Psihološka Obzorja / Horizons of Psychology |volume=18 |issue=2 |pages=23–38|doi = |pmid = |access-date = October 20, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; This can affect their mental state&lt;ref&gt;Kemmler, R.

Stress can also take a physical toll on a pilot's body, such as grinding of their teeth&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url = http://search.proquest.com/docview/621625653|title = Bruxism in military pilots and non-pilots: Tooth wear and psychological stress.|last = Lurie, Yehuda, Einy, Terracsh, Raviv, Goldstein|first = |date = 2007|journal = Aviation, Space, and Environmental Medicine |volume=78 |issue=2 |pages=137–139|doi = |pmid = |access-date = October 19, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; in difficult situations or even bladder problems when the pilot is flying with a higher [[G-force]] or for a long distance.&lt;ref&gt;Ohrui, Nobuhiro, Fumiko Kanazawa, Yoshinori Takeuchi, Yasutami Otsuka, Hideo Tarui, and Yoshinori Miyamoto. 2008.

== Improvements through crew resource management ==
After the 1950s, [[human error]] became the main cause of aviation accidents.&lt;ref name= "CRM" /&gt; Stress and fatigue continues to be an issue in the aviation industry. Hence, various training are being conducted to minimize it. The change began as [[NASA|National Aeronautics and Space Administration]] pointed out human limitations and emphasized the importance of teamwork.&lt;ref name= "CRM"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Sexton|first1=Bryan|last2=Thomas|first2=Eric|last3=Helmreich|first3=Robert|title=Error, Stress, and Teamwork in Medicine and Aviation: Cross Sectional Surveys|journal=British Medical Journal|date=18 Mar 2000|volume=320|issue=7237|pages=745–749|pmid=10720356|pmc=27316|doi=10.1136/bmj.320.7237.745}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Crew Resource Management]] is a type of training conducted to teach a flight crew different behavioral strategies, such as situational awareness, stress management, and decision-making.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Wilhelm|first1=John|last2=Merritt|first2=Ashleigh|last3=Helmreich|first3=Robert|title=The Evolution of Crew Resource Management Training in Commercial Aviation|date=January 1999|volume=9|issue=1|pages=19–32}}&lt;/ref&gt; When pilots are being hired, recruiters not only look at pilots' technical skills, but also at pilots' ability to learn from errors and evaluate how well they coordinate with other crew members.

Whitehead served as an army officer in France and East Africa during World War I, taking a leave from his graduate studies to do so. On the completion of his studies in 1920 after the war, he began working for the Admiralty, and remained there until his 1931 move to Harvard.{{r|witzel}}

During World War II, he again took a leave, this time from his professorship at Harvard, to work as an expert on American relations in the British [[Foreign Office]].{{r|crimson|witzel}} In 1940, before America entered the war, he advised [[Winston Churchill]] that American isolationism would not be a permanent obstacle, and after the Pearl Harbor attacks he communicated a message of solidarity to [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]].{{r|stinnett}}
It was also Whitehead's suggestion that Churchill compare America's proposed [[Lend-Lease]] policy to the [[Magna Carta]], and that one of the original copies of the Magna Carta then on display in America be made into a more permanent gift to seal the deal.{{r|hermiston}} However, this proposal fell through because the British government did not own any of the four surviving copies of the Magna Carta.{{r|kirka}}

== Academia ==
Whitehead joined the [[Harvard Business School]] in 1931, following his father who had moved to Harvard in 1924. He stayed at Harvard for the rest of his career except for a leave of absence during World War II. After the war, Whitehead ran the [[Harvard-Radcliffe Program in Business Administration]], a business program for women at [[Radcliffe College]], keeping also his appointment at Harvard. He became a naturalized American citizen in 1952. When Harvard's business school began admitting women in 1955, he returned to a full-time position at Harvard.{{r|crimson|witzel}} He remained at Harvard until his retirement.&lt;ref&gt;The ''Harvard Crimson'' gives his retirement date as 1963, while the ''Encyclopedia of History of American Management'' dates it to 1958.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Contributions ==
Whitehead's work ''The design and use of instruments'', published in 1934, was primarily written while he was still at the Admiralty. It prefigures the care in accurate measurement that Whitehead put into his work on the Hawthorne experiments. In this, Whitehead's "golden rule" was to "never measure more than is absolutely necessary".{{r|claus}}

The [[Hawthorne effect|Hawthorne experiments]] studied worker productivity at a [[Western Electric]] factory. They were originally intended to study the effects of lighting on productivity, but instead determined that workers reacted positively to the changing conditions of the experiment, and that their productivity decreased again when the experiment ended.{{r|gillespie}}
Whitehead, following the lead of [[Jean Piaget]], took the approach of carefully documenting the behavior of a small sample of workers over a long period of time.{{r|claus}}
His analysis of the Hawthorne experiments used rigorous statistics to argue "that personal and social relationships had been the dominant factors" in these effects.
His work has been criticized as "complex and poorly presented", with unoriginal ideas "expressed in infuriatingly vague prose". Nevertheless, his work is important as the only original mathematical analysis of the experimental data and the only complete record of the entire run of the experiments.{{r|gillespie}}

Besides his work on the Hawthorne experiments, Whitehead is known for pioneering the development of the fields of human relations, [[organizational behavior]], and [[human resource management]], and for his 1936 book ''Leadership in a Free Society'' on the structure and organization of human activity.{{r|witzel}}

==History==
In 1968, the Utah state legislature allocated 320 acres along the [[Bonneville Shoreline Trail]] to develop a [[research park]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Title 53B Chapter 17|url=http://le.utah.gov/xcode/Title53B/Chapter17/C53B-17-P5_1800010118000101.pdf|website=Utah Code|publisher=Utah State Legislature|accessdate=1 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Research Park was intended to stimulate economic development within the State of Utah and encourage students who graduate from the University of Utah to stay in Salt Lake City by providing research jobs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=East Bench Master Plan|url=http://www.slcdocs.com/Planning/Projects/EBMP/DraftPlanApril2016/6_RegionalActivityCenter.pdf|website=Plan Salt Lake City|publisher=Salt Lake City Corporation|accessdate=1 April 2017|date=April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1982, when the successful implantation of the [[Jarvik 7]] artificial heart attracted international headlines, artificial organ and medical device research and development at the University of Utah led [[Science Digest]] and the [[New York Times]] to nickname Salt Lake City the "Bionic Valley": "the epicenter of a bioengineering effort that promises to shake up the entire health-care system."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Utah's 'Bionic Valley' Produces Another Life-Changing Medical Device|url=http://www.matr.net/article-39035.html|accessdate=1 April 2017|agency=Montana Associated Technology Roundtables|date=20 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Zaslowsky|first1=Dyan|title=Regional Job Roundup - Mountain|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1985/10/13/jobs/regional-job-roundup-mountain.html|website=The New York Times|accessdate=1 April 2017|date=13 October 1985}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Whitewash Resolution''' is a proposed resolution for the waiver of rights of independent [[shareholder]]s to receive a mandatory [[takeover]] from the [[investor]] and its concert parties for the [[voting share|ordinary share]]s of the [[company]] not already owned or controlled by them.

A whitewash waiver is a [[corporate law]] concept originating in [[Hong Kong]] and [[Singapore]].  In some cases an investor will apply to the Executive for the Whitewash Waiver, which, if granted, will be subject to the approval of independent shareholders.

The '''Z. Smith Reynolds Foundation''' was formed by [[R. J. Reynolds]]' daughter, Mary Reynolds Babcock, and her siblings to honor their brother, [[Zachary Smith Reynolds]], who was murdered at the age of 20 at the Reynolds family home, [[Reynolda House]].&lt;ref name="wfu"&gt;{{cite news

|title=M O N U M E N T S of Brick and Learning |first=Dave |last=Roberts}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The foundation to this day gives away millions of dollars annually in the state of [[North Carolina]]. In 2008, the fund gave away $18 million in grants, including $2 million to [[Wake Forest University]].&lt;ref name="pj"/&gt;

During the [[2008 economic crisis]], the value of the foundation's trust declined 30% from its high of $470 million in November 2007.&lt;ref name="pj"/&gt; The foundation subsequently announced plans to revise the way it processes grants.&lt;ref name="pj"/&gt; The foundation, which has focused on affordable housing, immigration, education and the environment, will focus its environmental grants on water, energy and growth.&lt;ref name="pj"/&gt; The foundation's grants will be slightly less (at $16 million) than the $18 million given in 2008, but cuts will be steeper in 2010 and 2011.&lt;ref name="pj2"&gt;{{cite news
