The '''Alice Moseley Folk Art and Antique Museum''' is a museum in [[Bay St. Louis, Mississippi]]. The museum is dedicated to increasing understanding of the folk artist and painter Alice Moseley.

The museum was opened in the Blue House, the place of Moseley’s last residence, by Moseley’s son Tim shortly after her death. The museum moved to the historic Bay St. Louis Railroad Depot, across the street from the Blue House, and was re-opened on March 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Showers|first1=Al|title=Proposed Alice Moseley Art Museum embroiled in controversy|url=http://www.wlox.com/story/19711584/proposed-alice-moseley-art-museum-embroiled-in-controversy|accessdate=February 15, 2015|publisher=WLOX13}}&lt;/ref&gt; Admission to the museum is free.

==Alice Moseley==
Alice Latimer Moseley (1909–2004), known colloquially as Miss Alice, was born in Birmingham, Alabama, where she met and married W.&amp;nbsp;J. Moseley from Batesville, Mississippi. They moved to Memphis, Tennessee, during World War II and Miss Alice taught eighth grade English in Whitehaven and Memphis over the next 30 years. She began painting while caring for her Alzheimer's-afflicted mother, painted her first 40 paintings, went to the Nashville flea market with her son, and sold all 40 of her paintings within 30 minutes. They were purchased by a Mr. Barr, who used them to decorate his chain of steakhouses in Kentucky. That was the day that Alice Moseley became a professional folk artist. She always painted in acrylics because she said she was impatient and needed something that would dry quickly. Early on Moseley was labeled as an idyllic folk artist by Jules Pfeiffer in ''Folk Art Finder'', and "idyllic folk Art" was described as showing not only what the artist saw but what he or she wanted to see. Moseley began to receive acclaim and had a successful career while she lived in Pope, Mississippi, and did shows mostly in Memphis. After the death of her husband she moved to Bay St. Louis, Mississippi, in 1989, when she was 80 years old. She described those years in Bay St. Louis as the happiest and most successful years of our life. Moseley's paintings are historic in that they depict Southern life in the country during earlier times; they are literary in that Moseley's paintings did not just depict scenes but had to tell a story; Moseley's paintings are often comedic and reflect Alice Latimer Moseley's wonderful sense of people and sense of humor. Some of her more popular titles are: ''Life Is So Daily'', ''The House Is Blue But the Old  Lady Ain't'', and ''Labor Versus Management'', which shows a farmer throwing his hat down on the ground in anger while his mule sits on his hindquarters with a little smile on his face.

Alice Moseley painted until her death in July 2004, at the age of 94. Her blue house in Bay St. Louis was untouched by Hurricane Katrina even though it's only a half mile from the beach. Her son Tim Moseley founded the Alice Moseley Folk Art and Antique Museum after Katrina in 2006, and it has since been relocated from the blue house to the historic Bay St. Louis train depot. Visitors to Bay St. Louis rave about the museum and the entertaining and informative tours given by docents at the museum. The museum is free and is open Monday through Saturday from 10 to 4.&lt;ref&gt;INFORMATION FURNISHED BY ALICE'S SON, TIM MOSELEY, April 7, 2017&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Baldwin 60000''' is an experimental [[steam locomotive]] built by the [[Baldwin Locomotive Works]] in [[Eddystone, Pennsylvania]], in 1926, during the height of the railroading industry. It received its number for being the 60,000th locomotive built by Baldwin.&lt;ref name="Loco loco, Baldwin 60000" &gt;{{cite web |title=Baldwin 60000 |url=http://www.aqpl43.dsl.pipex.com/MUSEUM/LOCOLOCO/USAhp/USAhp.htm |publisher= Loco Locomotive gallery }}&lt;/ref&gt;

It was designed to be the best locomotive that Baldwin ever made. It boasts three cylinders, weighs about {{convert|350|ST|t LT|sigfig=3}}, including tender, and can pull a load of up to {{convert|7000|ST|t LT}}. Its top speed is {{convert|70|mph|abbr=on}}.{{citation needed|date=March 2014}}

60000 was very innovative, carrying unusual technology, including a [[Water-tube boiler#Hybrids|water-tube firebox]]. This was intended to improve efficiency but the tubes were prone to burst inside the [[Firebox (steam engine)|firebox]]. It is also a [[compound locomotive|compound]], expanding the steam once in the inside cylinder and then again in the two outside cylinders. Although compounding increases efficiency, it was an extra complication that the US railroads had mostly rejected by the middle twenties.&lt;ref name=lc50/&gt; The weight and length of the engine were too much for all but the heaviest and straightest tracks.

This locomotive was experimental and was meant to be the model for future development.  However, its demonstration runs never persuaded railroads to purchase more and in 1933, it was purchased by the [[Franklin Institute Science Museum]] for $1&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.railpictures.net/viewphoto.php?id=325552|title=RailPictures.Net Photo: BLW 60000 Baldwin Locomotive Works Steam 4-10-2 at Philadelphia, Pennsylvania by Mitch Goldman|website=www.railpictures.net|access-date=2016-03-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; and remains there today.

==Testing==
After a series brief test runs following construction, the 60000 was sent to the Pennsylvania Railroad's Altoona Test Plant in [[Altoona, Pennsylvania]]. Placed on rollers without its tender, it was tested on the traction dynamometer to measure its performance, which included maximum drawbar horsepower.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.cwrr.com/Lounge/Reference/baldwin/part02.html&lt;/ref&gt; Following tests at the Altoona Test Plant, the Pennsylvania Railroad placed the engine in freight service between [[Enola Yard]] near Harrisburg and [[Morrisville Yard]] via the [[Trenton Cutoff]]. During testing on the PRR, 60000 pulled a maximum of 7,700 tons.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.cwrr.com/Lounge/Reference/baldwin/part03.html&lt;/ref&gt;

Following testing on the PRR, the 60000 was sent for additional testing on the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad. Between November and December 1926, the 60000 was tested on the Cumberland Division between Brunswick and Keyser, Maryland, the Connellsville Division between Cumberland, Maryland, and Connellsville, Pennsylvania, and the Pittsburgh Division, which included the [[Sand Patch Grade|Sand Patch]] and Seventeen-Mile grades.&lt;ref name="cwrr.com"&gt;http://www.cwrr.com/Lounge/Reference/baldwin/part04.html&lt;/ref&gt;

In February 1927, the 60000 was sent to the Chicago, Burlington and Quincy Railroad's Beardstown Division of Illinois. The 60000 was run in tandem with the CB&amp;Q's own M2-A Class 2-10-2 number 6157, in order to compare coal and water consumption. Overall, the 60000 was superior in its coal and water consumption.&lt;ref name="cwrr.com"/&gt;

On 24 February 1927, the 60000 was sent to the Atchison, Topeka and Santa Fe Railroad. Testing was performed on the Pecos division between Clovis and Belen, New Mexico. As with the CB&amp;Q, the AT&amp;SF compared the performance of the 60000 with that of its own power in the form of two 3800-Class 2-10-2s. Once more the 60000 demonstrated superior fuel consumption than the locomotives of the host railroad.&lt;ref name="cwrr.com"/&gt;

In the summer and fall of 1927, the 60000 was sent to the Southern Pacific Railroad, which overhauled the locomotive and converted it to an oil burner at its Sacramento Shops. Following its conversion, the 60000 was tested in both freight and passenger service on the Sacramento Division, during which the engine carried a Southern Pacific tender. Following tests on the SP, the 60000 was sent to the Great Northern Railway between Everett, Washington and Minot, North Dakota. Overall, the 60000 did not perform as well on oil as it did on coal&lt;ref name="cwrr.com"/&gt;

Converted back to coal, the 60000 was then returned to the Baldwin Locomotive Works and used as a stationary boiler before being sold to the Franklin Institute.

'''''Bob Roberts''''' is a 1992 American-British [[Satire|satirical]] [[mockumentary]] film written, directed by, and starring [[Tim Robbins]]. It depicts the rise of Robert "Bob" Roberts Jr., a right-wing politician who is a candidate for an upcoming [[United States Senate]] election. Roberts is well financed, due mainly to past business dealings, and is well known for his music, which presents conservative ideas with gusto.

The film is Robbins's directorial debut, and is based on a short segment of the same title and featuring the same character that Robbins portrayed on ''[[Saturday Night Live]].''

==Plot==
''Bob Roberts'' takes place in [[Pennsylvania]], USA in 1990. It depicts a fictitious senatorial race between a [[Conservatism|conservative]] [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] country singer, Bob Roberts ([[Tim Robbins]]), and the incumbent [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democrat]], Brickley Paiste ([[Gore Vidal]]). The film is shot through the perspective of Terry Manchester ([[Brian Murray (actor)|Brian Murray]]), a British documentary filmmaker who is following the Roberts campaign. Through his lens we see Roberts travel across the state, performing songs about drug users, lazy people and the triumph of traditional family values over the rebelliousness of the 1960s. As the campaign continues, Paiste remains in the lead until a scandal arises involving him and a young woman who was seen emerging from a car with him. Paiste claims that she was a friend of his granddaughter whom he was driving home, but he cannot shake the accusations. 

Throughout the campaign, reporter Bugs Raplin ([[Giancarlo Esposito]]) attempts to use the documentary being made about Roberts as a way to expose him to the public as a fraud. Raplin believes that Roberts' anti-drug charity, Broken Dove, is connected to an old [[Allegations of CIA drug trafficking|Central Intelligence Agency drug trafficking scheme]]. As the election approaches, Roberts is asked to appear on a network's sketch comedy show. When Roberts announces that he will not be playing the song he had originally proposed, a dispute breaks out between the cast and producers of the show. This new song turns out to be nothing more than a thinly veiled campaign endorsement, and an angry staff member of the network pulls the plug mid-performance. As Roberts is leaving the studio, he is seemingly shot by a would-be [[assassination|assassin]]. Raplin, who has been causing problems for the campaign, is initially linked to the shooting, but he is later cleared when it is found that due to constrictive [[:wikt:palsy|palsy]] in his right hand he physically could not have fired the gun. Following the incident, Raplin contends that Roberts was never actually shot and that the gun was fired into the ground.

The campaign is boosted by public support following the assassination attempt, and Roberts wins the election with 52 percent of the vote. Although Roberts claims that his wounds have left him [[paralysis|paralyzed]] [[paraplegia|from the waist down]], he is seen tapping his feet at a celebration party. While Terry Manchester is interviewing Roberts' supporters outside the new Senator's hotel, a boy runs up shouting, "He's dead, he's dead, they got him!" When Manchester asks him what he is talking about, the boy shouts, "Bugs Raplin! He's dead! They got him!" A joyful celebration breaks out among Roberts' supporters, the shot changes to an image of his hotel room, and an upright walking shadow suggesting Roberts' profile passes the window before the lights go out. The film ends with a radio news report about Raplin's death at the hands of a [[right-wing politics|right-wing]] fanatic and a shot of Manchester standing in the [[Jefferson Memorial]], looking at the words, "I have sworn upon the altar of God eternal hostility against every form of tyranny over the mind of man", inscribed there.

==Style==
The film's style is drawn from a number of real and mock documentaries, and its shots are crafted to create this effect, in many cases through the use of hand-held cameras. Not only does Roberts' character draw from 60s era iconography of [[Bob Dylan]], it also contains scenes inspired by the 1967 documentary, ''[[Dont Look Back]]''&lt;!-- not a typo, apostrophe is intentionally omitted--&gt;, made about the singer, employing a similar (although consciously constructed) [[cinema verité]] style.&lt;ref&gt;Ansen, D. (1992) "Rattling the Political Cage." ''Newsweek''. 120 (10)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Canby, V. (1992) "Bob Roberts; A Singing Candidate, A Happy Trail of Hate." ''[[The New York Times]]''. September 2&lt;/ref&gt; The film also draws from [[Rob Reiner]]'s 1984 mockumentary ''[[This Is Spinal Tap]]'' which Robbins states is one of his favorite films,&lt;ref&gt;Roberge, C. (1992) "Tim Robbins campaigns for Bob Roberts and political change (interview)." ''The Tech.'' 112 (44) pg. 8&lt;/ref&gt; and directly references this during the scene in which Roberts gets lost in an auditorium attempting to find the stage before his performance. In the case of [[Gore Vidal]]'s character, the majority of the lines were not scripted, and instead Vidal based his role upon his own political beliefs, and his real-life positions on many of the fictional election topics.&lt;ref&gt;Johnson, B. (1992) "The Stars and Snipes." ''Maclean's''. 105 (37)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Kauffman, S. (1992) "Ballotomanes." ''The New Republic''. 207 (15) pp. 34-35&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reception==
While critics and audiences have responded to this film by connecting Roberts’ character to various political figures, such as [[George H. W. Bush]] and [[Pennsylvania]] senator [[Rick Santorum]], Robbins has said that the film related more to the political system in general than any specific politician.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1992"&gt;Roberge, C. (1992) Tim Robbins campaigns for Bob Roberts and political change (interview). The Tech. 112(44) Page 8&lt;/ref&gt; Much of Robbins' commentary is addressed at the role of the [[Mass media|media]] in election campaigns.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1992"/&gt; Some have critiqued Robbins for his approach toward [[political satire]], stating that his references to [[Ronald Reagan|Reagan]]-era politics and the rebelliousness of the 1960s are simply too [[anachronism|anachronistic]] in the context of the 1990s,&lt;ref&gt;Troy, G. (1993) Bob Roberts. The American Historical Review. 98(4) pp.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Wattenberg, D. (2001) No Nukes. National Review. 53(5) p55-57&lt;/ref&gt; but others have praised it for framing political commentary as a [[Hollywood]] comedy.&lt;ref&gt;Ansen, D. (1992) Rattling the Political Cage. Newsweek. 120(10)&lt;/ref&gt; In 2018, Robbins said “‘Bob Roberts’ came true,” referring to [[President Trump]]. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=https://www.nytimes.com/2018/02/03/style/tim-robbins.html | title=‘Hollywood Is Changing,’ Says Its Veteran Activist, Tim Robbins | work=[[The New York Times]] | date=February 3, 2018 | accessdate=February 3, 2018 | last=Dowd | first=Maureen}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On [[Rotten Tomatoes]] the film has a score of 97% based on 39 reviews, with an average rating of 7.5/10.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url= http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/bob_roberts/ | title= Bob Roberts (1992) | work= [[Rotten Tomatoes]] | publisher= [[Fandango Media]] | access-date=August 25, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[Roger Ebert]] praises the film "I like "Bob Roberts" - I like its audacity, its freedom to say the obvious things about how our political process has been debased - but if it had been only about campaign tactics and techniques, I would have liked it more" but says the thread about the investigative journalist doesn't work. He gives the film 3 out of 4 stars.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.rogerebert.com/reviews/bob-roberts-1992 &lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Creación de Bolivia Sucre1825.jpg|thumb|right|200px|The declaration of the Bolivian independence.]]
[[Bolivia]]'s independence was definitively proclaimed on 6 August 1825 at a congress held in [[Sucre|Chuquisaca]].

==Battle of Junín==
{{see also|Bolivian War of Independence}}
While the [[Gran Colombia]]n troops disembarked in the port of [[Callao]] under the command of General [[Antonio José de Sucre]], General [[Andrés de Santa Cruz]]—who until a short time before had been fighting in the ranks of the ''realistas'' (Spanish loyalists)—arrived to share the libertarian ideas of [[José de San Martín]] and was sent to augment Sucre's troops, beginning their march toward [[Upper Peru]]. In August 1823, they entered the city of [[La Paz]] and, forced to wage battle, Santa Cruz emerged victorious from the Battle of Zepita on 25 August 1823 against one of General Valdez's divisions.

Between the years of 1822 and 1823, the situation in [[Peru]] had turned chaotic: the armies had been defeated by the ''realistas'' and politics had plunged into anarchy. It was with these lamentable conditions that [[Simón Bolívar]] was confronted when on 1 September 1823 he arrived in [[Lima]]. The congress gave him charge of the military.

The situation could not have been more sober for the patriots. The independence of Peru was not assured, and on 29 February 1824 the ''realistas'' once again succeeded in occupying Lima. But this time, the political upheavals taking place in Spain spelled the final disintegration of the Spanish troops in America.

General [[Pedro Antonio Olañeta]], a recalcitrant absolute monarchist, rebelled against the viceroy [[José de la Serna e Hinojosa|La Serna]] (who himself had liberal and constitutionalist tendencies) because he attributed to him the desire to separate from the monarchy and liberate Peru from the absolute rule that Olañeta wanted to impose.

Bolívar met the divided ''realistas'' and quickly organized an army made up of Colombians, Argentines, and Peruvians. With this army, on 6 August 1824 he defeated the Spanish Army led by General [[José de Canterac]] and Colonel [[Manuel Isidoro Suárez]] on the fields of [[Battle of Junín|Junín]]. This victory represented above all the first step to the final triumph in the [[Battle of Ayacucho]]. The Spanish commanders—Canterac, Váldés, and de la Serna—reassembled in [[Cuzco]] and decided to reorganize their forces and flee before the victors of Junín.

==Battle of Ayacucho and the Arrival of Sucre in Upper Peru==
Charged by Bolívar, Sucre decided to continue his military campaign in Peru. On 9 December 1824, the independents triumphed in a spectacular victory on the plain of Ayacucho. The ''"Independence of Peru and America"'' was recognized with the capitulation of the viceroy La Serna. In response to the victory won in Ayacucho, he was later promoted, at the request of the Peruvian Congress, to [[Marshal]] and as [[General in Chief]] by the Colombian legislature. Bolivar later assigned him the mission to liberate Upper Peru and install a responsible independent national government.  Besides, his role was limited to giving an appearance of legality to the process that Upper Peruvians themselves had begun already.  But for the Spanish military personnel in Upper Peru, it was too little too late, as since 1815 (and the [[War of the Republiquetas]] in certain parts of Upper Peru), all out guerilla warfare had raged in this part of the continent, with hostilities esclatating since 1821.

In [[Cochabamba]] on January 16, a cavalry troop of American Dragoons rose up in rebellion. Colonel José Martínez arrested officials and the governor and then arrived to capture the First Battalion, Infantry Regiment Fernando VII's barracks, convincing the regiment to switch sides. He then asked the Santa Victoria cavalry squadron to stand down at once, leaving the city's entire garrison of 800 men in the hands of the independents. He appointed Mariano Guzmán as governor and before his own resignation, appointed Colonel Saturnino Sánchez, and then swore independence.&lt;ref&gt;Documentos para la historia de la guerra separatista del Perú. Autor: Torata (Fernando Valdés Héctor Sierra y Guerrero), Fernando Valdés Héctor Sierra y Guerrero Torata, Jerónimo Valdés Noriegay Sierra Torata, Torata (Jerónimo Valdés Noriega y Sierra). Publicado por M. Minuesa de los Ríos, 1898. pág. 7&lt;/ref&gt;

Lieutenant Colonel Pedro Arraya and troopers from the Santa Victoria and American Dragoons cavalry squadrons went to [[Chayanta Municipality|Chayanta]], where they also pledged their support to the Patriot cause in La Paz.

In [[Vallegrande]], the Second Battalion of the Infantry Regiment Fernando VII (with 200 men) also rebelled, deposing Brigadier General Francisco Javier Aguilera on 26 January. Colonel José Manuel Mercado occupied Santa Cruz de la Sierra on 14 February. Mojos and Chiquitos joined in the rebellion, increasing the ranks of Spanish soldiers who changed their loyalties to the independence movement. As a consequence of these actions, Olañeta abandoned La Paz on 22 January, heading for Potosí.

On 29 January 1825, General [[José Miguel Lanza]] (coming from nearby rural zones known as the ''Republiqueta de Ayopaya'') took the city of La Paz and declared the independence of the provinces of Upper Peru. Lanza was named the first president of Upper Peru. On 6 February, Field Marshal Sucre - at the head of the Liberation Army - crossed the [[Desaguadero River]], which was the border with Peru, and entered La Paz the next day.

In Chuquisaca, the ''"Dragones de la Frontera"'' Battalion of Colonel Francisco López defected to the independence cause and on 22 February officially declared the city independent.

Royalist general Pedro Antonio Olañeta stayed in Potosí, where he was welcomed late in the month by soldiers of the "Union" Infantry Battalion coming from Puno under the command of colonel José María Valdez. Olañeta then summoned a War Council, which agreed to continue the resistance in the name of Ferdinand VII. Next, Olañeta distributed his troops between Cotagaita fortress with the "Chichas" Battalion, commanded by colonel l Carlos de  Medinacelli, while Valdez was sent to Chuquisaca with the "Union" Infantry Battalion and loyalist militias, and Olañeta himself marched toward Vitichi, with 60,000 pieces of gold from the Coin House in Potosí. Olañeta abandoned Potosí on 28 March, just before the independent vanguard led by Arralla advanced to liberate the rich mining town.&lt;ref&gt;Apuntes para la historia de la Revolucion del Alto-perú, Hoi Bolivia. Autor Manuel María Urcullu. Publicado por Impr. de Lopez, 1855. pág. 151 - 152&lt;/ref&gt;

In spite the governor of Salta's (José Antionio Álvarez de Arenales) final orders not to advance, Colonel [[José María Pérez de Urdininea]] and 200 dragoons, together with the advance party of the independence forces, surprised the Tupiza garrison on 23 March.  At this point, the majority of royalist troops of Upper Peru refused to continue fighting against the powerful army of Sucre and switched allegiances. 

Colonel Medinacelli and 300 soldiers rebelled against Olañeta on 1 April, the two meeting the next day in the Battle of Tumusla, which culminated with the death of Olañeta. Diverse sources deny the existence of such a battle, arguing that Olañeta died of a single, self-inflicted gunshot. A few days later, on April 7, general José Mario Valdez surrendered in [[Chequelte]] to general Urdininea, putting an end to the war in Upper Peru and signalling victory to the local independence movement which had been active since 1811.

On 7 April, Sucre received an official letter sent by Álvarez de Arenales from Mojo (near Tupiza), informing him of the commission he had been given by the government in [[Buenos Aires]] on 8 February to treat (negotiate) with the ''realista'' leaders in the provinces of Upper Peru to end the war: ''"...on the basis that they need to remain at complete liberty to agree on what best suits their interests and government."''

==Congress of  Chuquisaca ==
On 6 August 1825, Field Marshal Antonio José de Sucre and Casimiro Olañeta, a lawyer from Chiquisaca and General Olañeta's nephew, convened all the provinces of Upper Peru to gather a congress to decide the destiny of the nation. However, the destiny of the new republic was subject to three possibilities:
# Pursue union with Buenos Aires, incorporating the whole of the United Provinces
# Maintain ties with Peru, recognizing the measures of incorporation dictated by the Viceroy Abascal as a result of the revolution of 16 July 1809 in La Paz
# Sustain with decision the absolute independence of Upper Peru, not only in relation to Spain, but also in reference to the [[United Provinces of the Río de la Plata]] and Peru

Even though the governments of Buenos Aires and Peru recognized this third alternative, Bolívar understood that to encourage at that moment an act of sovereignty of this nature—conspiring against the interests of Gran Colombia—as the territory of the [[Royal Audience of Quito]] could expect the same treatment as Charcas. Bolívar did not publicly undermine Sucre's authority, but did reproach him in a private letter regarding this initiative.

The General Constituent Congress of Buenos Aires, by degree on 9 May 1925, declared that ''"although the four departments of Upper Peru have always belonged to this state, it is the will of the general constituent congress that they remain at full liberty to decide their fate, as they believe will suit their interests and their happiness,"'' clearing the way for the independence of Upper Peru as an independent entity.

Sucre, a little annoyed by Bolívar's criticism, after demonstrating that he was right, announced that he would obey orders but would also leave the country because he that ordered him did not share his views. To the contrary, Bolívar was in conflict with Sucre's conscience and this compromised his faith in Bolívar's word.

==Declaration of Independence==
The deliberating Assembly convened anew in Chuquisaca on 9 July 1825. It concluded with the determination of the complete independence of Upper Peru, in the form of a republic, for the sovereignty of its children. Finally, the president of the Assembly - [[José Mariano Serrano]] - and a commission wrote the "Act of Independence", which bears the date 6 August 1825 in honor of the Battle of Junín won by Bolívar in Peru, whose introduction states as follows:

{{cita|''"The world knows that Upper Peru has been on the American continent, the altar on which was spilled the first blood of the free and the land where the last of the tyrants lays.  Today, the Upper Peruvian departments, united, protest in the face of the whole Earth its irrevocable resolution to be governed by themselves.''"}}

Independence was declared by 7 representatives from Charcas, 14 from Potosí, 12 from La Paz, 13 from Cochabamba, and 2 from Santa Cruz.

==Bolívar and Bolivia==
Through  a decree it was determined that the new state in Upper Peru would carry the name of [[República Bolívar]], in honor of the liberator, who was designated as "Father of the Republic and Supreme Chief of State". Bolívar thanked them for these honors, but declined the presidency of the Republic, a duty he gave instead to the victor of Ayacucho, Grand Marshal Sucre, who would later be sworn in the same day as the first [[President of Bolivia]]. After some time, the subject of the name of the Young nation arose again, and a Potosian deputy named [[Manuel Martín Cruz]] offered a solution, suggesting that in the same manner which from [[Romulus]] comes Rome, from Bolívar ought to come the new nation of [[Bolivia]].

{{cita|"''If from Romulus, Rome; from Bolívar, it is Bolivia''".}}

By the time Bolívar got the news of the decision, he felt flattered by the young nation, but until then he hadn’t accepted willingly Upper Peru's fate as an independent republic because he was worried about its future, due to Bolivia's location in the center of South America; this, according to Bolivar, would create a nation that would face many future wars, which curiously did happen. Bolivar wished that Bolivia would become part of another nation, preferably Peru (given the fact that it had been part of [[Viceroyalty del Perú]] for centuries), or Argentina (since during the last decades of colonial domain it had been part of [[Viceroyalty del Río de la Plata]]), but what deeply convinced him otherwise was the attitude of the people, who longed more for independence. On August 18, upon his arrival to La Paz, there was a manifestation of popular rejoicing. The same scene repeated when the Liberator arrived to [[Oruro, Bolivia|Oruro]], then to Potosí and finally to Chuquisaca. Such a fervent demonstration by the people touched Bolívar, who called the new nation his "Predilect Daughter", and was called the "Favorite Son" of the new country by its people.

On 18 May 1826 in Lima, Bolívar signed on behalf of Peru a degree recognizing the independence of Bolivia.

==Controversies and Historical Contradictions==
In 2008, modern-day historians commented on the declaration of independence, bringing forth certain contradictions and controversies. The say that it was Colonel Carlos de Medinacelli who was the first liberator of Bolivia and that to this day he is a forgotten hero. After the Battle of Tumusla on 1 April 1825— a day of patriotism that should be celebrated as a historical day instead of 6 August—it was he that had the clear idea that these lands should give birth to a republican life with an identity separate from that of Argentina or Peru. They also say that upon the arrival of Bolívar and Sucre, the Spanish troops had already been defeated. As these represented a significant part of Imperial Spain, it lost its historic territory to the screams of war for the independence of ancient Charcas (Upper Peru).[http://www.bolivia.com/Noticias/AutoNoticias/DetalleNoticia31346.asp]

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5058">{{Evidence law}}
The '''business records exception''' to the [[Hearsay in United States law|U.S. hearsay rule]] is based on Rule 803(6) of the [[Federal Rules of Evidence]] (FRE).   It is sometimes referred to as the '''business entry rule'''.

==Scope of exception==
[[Business records]], for the purposes of the exception, are any writings or records of acts, events, conditions, opinions, or diagnosis, made at or near the time by, or from information transmitted by, a person with knowledge are admissible if kept in the regular course of business and if it was the regular course of business to make that record, unless the source of information or circumstances of preparation indicate a lack of trustworthiness.

Business is used in Rule 803(6) to mean any business, institution, association, [[profession]], or occupation, regardless of whether or not it is conducted for [[Profit (economics)|profit]].  Therefore, such records could conceivably include those of [[Religion|religious]] and [[charitable organization]]s, [[hospital]]s, [[school]]s, and even criminal organizations.&lt;ref name="federalevidence.com"&gt;http://federalevidence.com/rules-of-evidence#Rule803&lt;/ref&gt;

==Rationale==
The basic rationale for the exception is that employees are under a duty to be accurate in observing, reporting, and recording business facts.  The underlying belief is that special reliability is provided by the regularity with which the records are made and kept, as well as the incentive of employees to keep accurate records (under threat of [[Termination of employment|termination]] or other penalty).  The exception functions to allow the record to substitute for the in-court testimony of the employees, but it can only substitute for what the employee could testify about.  The availability of the [[declarant]] (the employee whose testimony is being replaced by the record) is immaterial for the purposes of this exception.

===Reliability of the statements in the record===
It must be apparent to the judge that the record was made in the regular course of business, i.e., that it was customary practice to make such an entry and that the entrant had a duty to record it (either by law or by the terms of his employment).  The record must have been made at or near the time of the act, event, or transaction at issue.  Furthermore, the record must consist of matters either within the personal knowledge of the entrant or within the personal knowledge of someone with a duty to transmit the information to the entrant.

This last point was contested in the case of ''Johnson v. Lutz'', 253 N.Y. 124, 170 N.E. 517 (1930), which held that a business record is admissible only when it is made by an employee about information, obtained by him, from an informant who himself was under a business duty to impart that information.  ''Johnson'' dealt specifically with the admissibility of [[police report]]s, and set a limitation on the use of such reports in court.  Even though the police officer was under a duty to properly record the statements of an [[informant]], the informant himself was under no duty to report the events correctly, and therefore the informant's statement was still inadmissible hearsay.

===Limitation on admissibility of records prepared for litigation===
In the case of ''[[Palmer v. Hoffman]]'', {{ussc|318|109|1943}}, the [[Supreme Court of the United States]] ruled that an accident report created by a [[railroad]] company which was prepared in anticipation of a [[lawsuit]] by the victim was inadmissible, because it was not prepared in the regular course of business.  Railroad travel, and not litigation, was the primary business of the railroad, and therefore the report was not considered sufficiently reliable to be admitted into evidence.

==Lack of record as evidence==
FRE 803(7) states the negative counterpart of the business records exception:  the use of the ''lack of a record'' to prove that a transaction or occurrence had not taken place, if it was the regular practice of the business to record such events if they had actually occurred.&lt;ref name="federalevidence.com"/&gt;

==Other types of business records==
Under FRE 803(17), market reports and [[Financial quote|quotations]], directories, and other published compilations are considered generally admissible if they are generally used and relied upon by the public or by persons in particular occupations.  Such information is considered admissible separate and apart from privately made business records described above.

[[File:Chambers's Encyclopaedia title.jpg|thumb|The design and wording that appeared at the start of each volume of the first edition.]]
'''''Chambers's Encyclopaedia''''' was founded in 1859&lt;ref name=Concluding&gt;Chambers, W. &amp; R. [https://archive.org/stream/cu31924087904706#page/n11/mode/2up "Concluding Notice"] in ''Chambers's Encyclopaedia''. London: W. &amp; R. Chambers, 1868, Vol. 10, pp. v-viii.&lt;/ref&gt; by [[W. &amp; R. Chambers]] of [[Edinburgh]] and became one of the most important English language encyclopaedias of the 19th and 20th centuries, developing a reputation for accuracy and scholarliness that was reflected in other works produced by the [[Chambers Harrap|Chambers]] publishing company. The encyclopaedia is no longer produced.  A selection of illustrations and woodblocks used to produce the first two editions of the encyclopaedia can be seen on a [https://www.nms.ac.uk/chambers digital resource] hosted on the [https://www.nms.ac.uk/collections-research/our-research/highlights-of-previous-projects/ National Museums Scotland website]. 

==First edition==
The first edition, titled ''Chambers's Encyclopaedia A Dictionary of Universal Knowledge for the People'', was partly based on a translation into English of the 10th edition of the [[German language|German-language]] ''Konversations-Lexikon'', which became the [[Brockhaus Enzyklopädie]],&lt;ref name=EB&gt;[http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/105004/Chamberss-Encyclopaedia "Chambers’s Encyclopaedia"] ''Encyclopædia Britannica Online'', 2013. Retrieved 30 August 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; however, the publishers found it necessary to include much additional material.&lt;ref name=Concluding/&gt; Including more than 4000 [https://www.nms.ac.uk/collections-research/our-research/highlights-of-previous-projects/chambers-collection/research/illustration-styles-and-subjects/illustration-styles/ illustrations not present in Brockhaus].  [[Andrew Findlater]] was the acting editor and spent ten years on the project.&lt;ref name=Concluding/&gt; The work appeared between 1859 and 1868 in 520 weekly parts at three-halfpence each&lt;ref name=Chambers/&gt; and totalled ten [[octavo]] volumes, on 8,320 pages, and over 27,000 articles from over 100 authors.&lt;ref name=Concluding/&gt; Volume 10 included a supplement of 409 pages at the back for new and revised content. A revised edition appeared in 1874. The index of matters not having special articles contained about 1,500 headings. The articles were generally excellent, especially on [[Jewish literature]], [[folk-lore]] and [[practical science]]; but, as in Brockhaus, the scope of the work did not allow extended treatment.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|p=382}}

==Later editions==
An entirely new edition was published 1888–1892 in ten volumes edited by [[David Patrick (writer)|David Patrick]]. In this edition, the majority of the articles were rewritten and the articles on [[United States|American]] matters were written mainly by Americans and an edition published there by Messrs. [[J. B. Lippincott &amp; Co.|Lippincott]] of [[Philadelphia]]. This second edition had about 800 fewer illustrations than the first edition, although other visual features, such as tables and fold-out maps increased. [https://www.nms.ac.uk/collections-research/our-research/highlights-of-previous-projects/chambers-collection/research/illustration-styles-and-subjects/illustration-styles/  See illustration styles of Chambers's Encyclopaedia page.]

Further new editions appeared regularly, edited by Patrick, up to the [[First World War]].{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|p=382}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |last=Patrick  |first=David |url=https://archive.org/stream/chamberssency01lond#page/n8/mode/1up |title=Preface |encyclopedia=Chambers's Encyclopaedia |location=London &amp; Edinburgh |publisher=William &amp; Roberts Chambers |year=1901 |volume=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The last editions to keep to the original ten volume format were published under the editorship of [[William Geddie]] in 1923-27 and 1935.&lt;ref name=Chambers/&gt;

==1950 edition==
The modern ''Chambers's'' was published in 15 volumes in 1950 by [[George Newnes]] and while being international in scope, has been described by ''[[Encyclopædia Britannica]]'' as British in orientation and conservative in approach with largely British contributors.&lt;ref name=EB/&gt; The Managing Editor, Mrs [[Law (surname)|M.D. Law]], called it a completely new work with an historic name and noted in the preface that the encyclopaedia "...is primarily a British production and therefore no doubt reflects to some extent the intellectual atmosphere of post-war Britain. This implies belief in international co-operation rather than nationalistic isolationism, and in [[freedom of speech]], and [[Freedom of worship|worship]], [[Freedom of information|information]] and [[freedom of association|association]] rather than in any [[totalitarian]] conception".&lt;ref name=Chambers&gt;Law, M.D. "Preface" in ''Chambers’s Encyclopædia''. London: [[George Newnes]], 1961, Vol. 1, pp. vii-x.&lt;/ref&gt; The publication was celebrated at a luncheon at [[Grocer's Hall]] attended by over 100 contributors and which was chaired by [[Sir Frank Newnes, 2nd Baronet|Sir Frank Newnes]]. It was announced that the encyclopaedia, which had taken six years to prepare, had cost £500,000 and included the work of over 2,300 authors. [[William Jowitt, 1st Earl Jowitt|Lord Jowitt]], the [[Lord Chancellor]], gave the toast and described the endeavor as "outstanding proof" of British scholarship, while Mrs Law commented that she believed the work to be the first major encyclopaedia to be published in Britain since before the First World War.&lt;ref&gt;"Six Years' Work On Encyclopaedia" in ''[[The Times]]'', 25 April 1950, p. 8. ''The Times'' Digital Archive. Retrieved 29 August 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

Subsequent reports from the publishers, Newnes, confirmed that the work was a great success with sales requiring regular reprinting which also allowed for considerable revision of the work. By the 1961 revised edition, several million words had been revised or replaced and over half the total pages had been re-set or changed in some way.&lt;ref name=Chambers/&gt; The encyclopaedia was regarded as such a scholarly achievement that Mrs Law received the [[O.B.E.]] for her efforts. She retired in 1963.&lt;ref&gt;"Encyclopaedia Editor Retires" in ''The Times'', 29 August 1963, p. 10. The Times Digital Archive. Retrieved 29 August 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

==1966 edition==

The '''''Clerical Guide or Ecclesiastical Directory''''' was the earliest ever specialist directory to cover the clergy of the [[Church of England]]. In its initial format it appeared just four times – in 1817, 1822, 1829 and 1836, under the editorial direction of [[Richard Gilbert (printer)|Richard Gilbert]].

Another edition was actually advertised for 1838,&lt;ref name="paflin"&gt;[http://www.churchtimes.co.uk/content.asp?id=48255] [[Church Times]]: two-part article ''Shop-talk and mordant wit'', by Christopher Currie &amp; Glyn Paflin, describing the background to [[Crockford's Clerical Directory]]'s first hundred editions, 6–13 December 2007&lt;/ref&gt; but no copies have in fact been found within the main academic libraries.

The title was briefly revived by Thomas Bosworth &amp; Company during the 1880s.

==Contents of the Clerical Guide==

The main alphabetical section of the directory included:

*A list of benefices together with their populations, counties, dioceses and  archdeaconries
*Their incumbents with the year of his institution
*Their values (up to the 1829 edition) in the [[Valor Ecclesiasticus]] or King's Books
*The names of their patrons.
*The 1836 edition additionally gave the income of the benefice during the year 1831, the available capacity or "church room" for the congregation, and the name of any [[impropriator]].

The preliminary pages included:

*Current lists of [[bishops]], members of [[cathedral chapter]], and other dignitaries, showing the values of their [[first fruits]]
*A section on the Doctors of Laws, the [[canon law|canonical]] specialists
*A section on the [[Chapel Royal]] together with the king's preachers and chaplains
*Sections on [[Sion College]] and [[Gresham College]]
*Sections on the two English universities ([[University of Oxford|Oxford]] and [[University of Cambridge|Cambridge]])
*Sections on the fellows and schoolmasters of [[Eton College|Eton]], [[Winchester College|Winchester]], [[Westminster School|Westminster]], [[Harrow School|Harrow]], [[Manchester Grammar School|Manchester]] and [[St Paul's School, London|St Paul's]].

The alphabetical list of benefices was also followed by an alphabetical list of the prelates, dignitaries and beneficed clergy of the Church of England (generally omitting the unbeneficed clergy).

The directories concluded with lists of ecclesiastical patronage, giving the names of those benefices within the gift of the king and also those of the lord chancellor, the chancellor of the duchy of Lancaster, the various archbishops and bishops, and the two universities.

==The publishers==

The 1817 edition stated that it was "printed for [[Rivington (publishers)|J. C. &amp; F. Rivington]], 62 St Paul's Churchyard, by R. &amp; R. Gilbert, St John's Square, [[Clerkenwell]]".  '''Richard Gilbert''' was a printer and an accountant with the [[SPCK]].  Although he appeared in the 1817 edition merely as the "printer" (alongside his brother Robert, who died the following year), he thereafter seems to have taken a more prominent role in its production.  The 1822 edition was "corrected by Richard Gilbert", as though he had been engaged in putting right someone else's mistakes.  He similarly wrote the prefaces for subsequent editions, and the 1836 edition still bore the names "Gilbert and Rivington, printers, St John's Square".

Gilbert, an industrious compiler who was additionally very active in the religious life of Clerkenwell, also produced a pocket-sized '''Clergyman's Almanack''' in 1819 &lt;ref&gt;Oxford Dictionary of National Biography: article on Richard Gilbert&lt;/ref&gt;

==The Clerical Guide after 1836==

The failure of the directory to appear after 1836 left open an opportunity for a rival publication.  This was filled after 1841 by the [[Clergy List]].

After lying dormant for fifty years, the title '''Clerical Guide and Ecclesiastical Directory''' was briefly revived in 1886 by Thomas Bosworth &amp; Company, 65 [[Great Russell Street]]. Once again the volume offered alternative listings of the clergy and the benefices, together with other "valuable information … from the office of the [[Ecclesiastical Commission (Church of England)|Ecclesiastical Commission]].&lt;ref&gt;The Times newspaper, Thursday, Mar 18, 1886; pg. 12&lt;/ref&gt;  However the relaunched title was very quickly acquired by Hamilton Adams of [[Paternoster Row]], who in 1889 merged it with their other recent acquisition, the aforementioned Clergy List.&lt;ref name="paflin" /&gt;

In the issue for 1918/19 the Clergy List was merged in its turn with [[Crockford's Clerical Directory]]. Thereafter until the 1930s the latter title still continued to advertise on its preliminary pages that it "incorporated the Clergy List", together with the "Clerical Guide and Ecclesiastical Directory".

A microfiche version of the 1829 directory was produced during the 1980s by the [[Society of Genealogists]]. In more recent years scanned copies of the early editions have also appeared on the World Wide Web.&lt;ref&gt;All four editions of the Clerical Guide from 1817-1836 may be downloaded free of charge from the Google eBookstore [https://books.google.com/ebooks]&lt;/&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2003, it was acquired by [[Dun &amp; Bradstreet]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.wsj.com/news/articles/SB10000872396390444860104577561291194891660|title=Dun &amp; Bradstreet Explores Sale|author=Anupreeta Das|date=July 31, 2012|publisher=[[The Wall Street Journal]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; and operated for a time as a wholly owned subsidiary. In 2017, the Hoover's product was re-branded D&amp;B Hoovers.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.aol.com/2013/05/16/new-db-hoovers-analytics-product-gives-small-busin/|title=New D&amp;B Hoovers Analytics™ Product Gives Small Businesses the Power to Uncover Prospects and Drive G|last=Staff|first=A. O. L.|website=AOL.com|access-date=2017-08-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Origins and expansion ==
Hoover's was started in 1990 by [[Gary Hoover]], [[Patrick Spain|Patrick J. Spain]], Alan Chai and Alta Campbell. Earlier, Hoover had founded the [[Bookstop (company)|Bookstop]] book store chain and then sold it to [[Barnes &amp; Noble]]. Hoover's initially was called The Reference Press and published reference books about companies. (Books for libraries and related markets are still published, but book publishing is a small part of Dun &amp; Bradstreet's sales.)&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name="ReferenceA" /&gt;

The company grew rapidly under a business team led by Spain that included Carl Shepherd, Lynn Atchison, Elisabeth DeMarse, Jani Spede, Kris Rao and Gordon Anderson, among others. Spain was CEO from 1993 to 2001 and chairman from 1994 to 2002.

Hoover's made an [[initial public offering]] on the [[NASDAQ]] exchange in 1999.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.marketwatch.com/story/db-to-buy-hoovers-for-117-million|title=D&amp;B to buy Hoover's for $117 million|last=Francisco|first=Bambi|date=2002-12-05|work=MarketWatch|access-date=2017-08-16|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Hoover's SEC filing 424B4, 21 July 1999&lt;/ref&gt; The company then became a subsidiary of [[Dun &amp; Bradstreet]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.bizjournals.com/austin/stories/2003/02/03/daily62.html|title=AV, Marathon propose sweeter bid for Hoover's|last=|first=|date=2003-02-07|website=www.bizjournals.com|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2017-08-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; which bought Hoover's for $119 million in 2003.

After the acquisition of Avention by [[Dun &amp; Bradstreet]] in 2017, the D&amp;B Hoovers solution was launched and replaced the existing Hoover’s product.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== Operations ==
[[Dun &amp; Bradstreet]] maintains a [[database]] of more than 300 million companies with 30,000 global data sources updated 5 million times per day.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hoovers.com/|title=Hoovers - Company Information - Industry Information - Lists|work=hoovers.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; It combines [[Dun &amp; Bradstreet|Dun &amp; Bradstreet’s]] data with Avention’s [[sales acceleration]] platform.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://investor.dnb.com/secfiling.cfm?filingID=1115222-17-7&amp;CIK=1115222|title=The Dun &amp; Bradstreet Corporation - Annual Report|website=investor.dnb.com|language=en|access-date=2017-08-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; Subscriptions are sold primarily to sales, marketing, and business development professionals seeking contact information for prospects.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;See, e.g., Hoover's SEC filing 10-K, 31 March 2002&lt;/ref&gt; The database is used for lead generation, outreach, prepping for sales calls, researching companies, being alerted to changes in leadership, and acquiring new customers.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.hoovers.com/|title=Sales leads, Company Profiles, Business Database &amp; Sales Acceleration Solutions|access-date=2017-08-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Besides publishing information through the D&amp;B Hoovers product, information is also distributed via data feeds and third-party licensing agreements.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA" /&gt;

D&amp;B Hoovers offers proprietary business information through an online platform and integrated workflow solutions. The product houses data on more than 120 million business records across 1,000 industries.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

'''DNS rebinding''' is a form of [[computer security|computer attack]]. In this attack, a malicious [[web page]] causes visitors to run a [[Client-side scripting|client-side script]] that attacks machines elsewhere on the network. In theory, the [[same-origin policy]] prevents this from happening: client-side scripts are only allowed to access content on the same host that served the script. Comparing [[domain name]]s is an essential part of enforcing this policy, so DNS rebinding circumvents this protection by abusing the [[Domain Name System]] (DNS).

This attack can be used to breach a [[private network]] by causing the victim's [[web browser]] to access computers at private [[IP address]]es and return the results to the attacker. It can also be employed to use the victim machine for [[spamming]], [[distributed denial-of-service attack]]s, or other malicious activities.

==How DNS rebinding works==

The attacker registers a domain (such as attacker.com) and delegates it to a [[DNS server]] that is under the attacker's control. The server is configured to respond with a very short [[time to live#DNS records|time to live (TTL) record]], preventing the DNS response from being [[DNS cache|cached]]. When the victim browses to the malicious domain, the attacker's DNS server first responds with the [[IP address]] of a server hosting the malicious client-side code. For instance, they could point the victim's browser to a website that contains malicious [[JavaScript]] or [[Adobe Flash|Flash]] scripts that are intended to execute on the victim's computer.

The malicious client-side code makes additional accesses to the original domain name (such as attacker.com). These are permitted by the same-origin policy. However, when the victim's browser runs the script it makes a new DNS request for the domain, and the attacker replies with a new IP address. For instance, they could reply with an internal IP address or the IP address of a target somewhere else on the Internet.

==Protection==
The following techniques attempt to prevent DNS rebinding attacks:&lt;ref&gt;https://crypto.stanford.edu/dns/dns-rebinding.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://www.adambarth.com/papers/2009/jackson-barth-bortz-shao-boneh-tweb.pdf ([http://crypto.stanford.edu/~dabo/abstracts/dnsrebind.html])&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://www.ptsecurity.com/upload/corporate/ww-en/download/DNS-rebinding.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://blog.trendmicro.com/trendlabs-security-intelligence/protecting-your-router-against-possibl-dns-rebinding-attacks/&lt;/ref&gt;

*DNS servers in the chain can filter out [[private IP address]]es and [[loopback IP address]]es:
**External public DNS servers (e.g. [[OpenDNS]]) can implement DNS filtering.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web
| url=https://umbrella.cisco.com/blog/2008/04/14/finally-a-real-solution-to-dns-rebinding-attacks/
| title=Finally, a real solution to DNS rebinding attacks
| first=David
| last=Ulevitch
| date=2008-04-14
| publisher=[[Cisco]]
| accessdate=2017-07-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;
**Local [[system administrator]]s can configure the organization's local [[nameserver]](s) to block the resolution of external names into internal IP addresses. (This has the downside of allowing an attacker to map the internal address ranges in use.)
*A [[firewall (computing)|firewall]] (e.g. dnswall), in the gateway or in the local pc, can filter DNS replies that pass through it, discarding local addreses.&lt;ref&gt;{{GitHub|abortz/google-dnswall}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://doc.pfsense.org/index.php/DNS_Rebinding_Protections&lt;/ref&gt;
*Web browsers can resist DNS rebinding:
**Web browsers can implement DNS pinning:&lt;ref&gt;https://www.usenix.org/system/files/conference/woot13/woot13-dai.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; the IP address is locked to the value received in the first DNS response. This technique may block some legitimate uses of [[Dynamic DNS]], and may not work against all attacks. However, it is important to fail safe (stop rendering) if the IP address does change, because using an IP address past the TTL expiration can open the opposite vulnerability when the IP address has legitimately changed and the expired IP address may now be controlled by an attacker.
**The [[NoScript]] extension for [[Firefox]] includes [[noscript#Application Boundaries Enforcer .28ABE.29|ABE]], a firewall-like feature inside the browser which in its default configuration prevents attacks on the local network by preventing external webpages from accessing local IP addresses.
*Web servers can reject [[HTTP]] requests with an unrecognized [[list of HTTP header fields|Host header]].

'''Dionýz Ďurišin''' (October 16, 1929 – January 26, 1997)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Dionýz Ďurišin|url=http://www.litcentrum.sk/slovenski-spisovatelia/dionyz-durisin|website=Literárne informačné centrum}}&lt;/ref&gt; was a leading Slovak literary theorist and comparativist. He belonged to the [[Slovaks|Slovak]] School of [[Comparative Literature]]. He worked in the tradition of the Czech and Slovak schools of [[comparative literature]]. He is renowned for developing the notions of [[world literature]] and [[interliterary processes]]. 

==Work==
In his work ''Theory of Literary Comparatistics'' (1984), he defines "literary process" as the "inner laws of development of literature."  He elaborates upon the goal of literary studies, and comparative literature in particular, by noting: "To comprehend the literary phenomenon means not merely to describe its constituents, or to point out their mutual affinity and interdependence within the work of literature, but to reveal  the multifarious affinities of the literary phenomenon and the individual procedures with the social, cultural, artistic and literary background in the widest sense of the word" (p.&amp;nbsp;11). He notes that the ultimate goal of literary research was not "merely reconstruction of the laws of national literature as an organic literary-historical unit, but also the comprehension of the broader laws of the literary process, leading in the final result to the comprehension of the laws governing world literature" (p.&amp;nbsp;12). In the same book, Ďurišin claimed that he was developing the native Slovak tradition of criticism and developing ideas of theorists like [[Alexander Veselovsky]] and [[Viktor Zhirmunsky]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5271">'''Emile Doo's Chemist Shop''' was originally situated at 358 Halesowen Road, [[Netherton, West Midlands|Netherton]], England, and was later rebuilt in the [[Black Country Living Museum]].

==Chemists in the early 1900s==
{{coord|52|31|23.2|N|2|4|37.86|W|region:GB|display=title}}
Before the [[National Health Service]] was formed, local [[chemist]] shops like Doo's played an important part in the health of the local community. They offered services such as free medical advice, basic First Aid and weekly weighing of babies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Black Country Living Museum Guide|year=2012|publisher=Black Country Living Museum|isbn=9780750926294|pages=42|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=jm-eAAAACAAJ&amp;dq=Black+Country+Living+Museum&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=nccrUv6QCoP84AOE74CAAQ&amp;ved=0CEcQ6AEwAg}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Emile Doo's as a chemists==
Doo's was originally built in 1886 as a tailor's shop. James Emile Doo traded from 1882 in a building across the road from 358, the business being taken over by his newly qualified son Harold Emile Doo, in about 1918. In 1929 Harold moved trading to their new premises at 358. The move was so carefully planned that dispensing was carried out until 10:00 p.m. on Saturday night in the old premises, and then started trading in the new premises the next morning at 9:00 a.m. Harold traded as a chemist until ill health forced his retirement in May 1968.

==Emile Doo's as an exhibit==
The shop lay untouched from 1968 to 1973, when the fittings and stock were donated to The Black Country Living Museum. The shop now located in The [[Black Country Living Museum]] is built using bricks reclaimed from two houses which were demolished in Pearson Street, [[Old Hill]]. The original shop front was also rescued and forms part of the exhibit today. The shop exhibition is much tidier than the shop would have been in real life. It would have been cluttered with hampers full of deliveries often leaving little room for customers.

With guidance from Emile Doo's daughter Betty, the shop has been laid out as it was shortly after the move across the road in 1929.

===Items on display===

====Wafer machine====
This was used for making thin soluble wafers for customers who needed medication dissolved in water. The prescribed ingredients were mixed to a paste with a binding agent and milk sugar. The mixture was then smeared over the top plate, which was flipped up so the wafers would slide into the bottom tray and could be dispensed via the extended section at the corner.

====Paper folder====
Before pills and tablets became widespread, prescribed medicine was mainly dispensed in the form of powders.

The practice continued in this century for things such as headache powders and infant teething powders. The ingredients were mixed together in a mortar and then individually wrapped in separate doses. The paper squares in which the powders were folded all had to be folded to the same dimensions so that they would fit neatly together into a box for the customer. The width of the paper could be adjusted using the ratchet mechanism on the side. The dose of powder was placed in the middle of a rectangular piece of white demi paper. The two edges were folded over to the width of the box, and then the paper strip was pressed over the folder to form two sharp creases. The two ends were brought together and one end pushed into the other forming a secure package. The folded doses were then put in a box or tied together to form a neat bundle.

====Suppository mould====
The ingredients for the [[Suppository|suppositories]] were melted into a base of cocoa butter or glycerine, and the mixture was brought to the boil and poured into the moulds.  When the preparation was set (after about 30 minutes in cool weather) the two halves were unscrewed to release the suppositories.

====Emile Doo====
Known locally as Jack, he was a well-known figure in Netherton, both through his work at The Chemist, and also for his involvement in amateur theatricals. He was a member of The 'Blue and Whites', a Pierrot troupe and did make up for other groups.

In the main, his life was dominated by the shop which was a focal point for local residents who needed minor treatment but could not afford doctors' fees. He had a considerable reputation for his own remedies. People came from far and wide to visit the shop. If you lived too far away to visit the shop, you could have your medicine delivered by post. He kept a book with all his remedies listed in, which his daughter still keeps today.

He qualified as a pharmacist in 1908. When he took the exam there were 133 candidates. 95 failed, with only 38 candidates achieving a pass. His certificate, and his father's, are on display.

Mr Doo suffered badly from arthritis, so could not move around easily. This may help explain why there was so much untouched stock in the cellar of the shop.

Locals who remember him, described him as a white haired gentleman who whistled constantly through his teeth as he worked in the shop.
 
His dog Pip was a character too. The dog would come along to visit him during opening hours, having travelled alone by tram from Kinver to reach the shop.

'''''Ex Parte Meier en Andere''''', an important case in [[South African succession law]], concerned an application for the appointment of a ''curator bonis'' to manage the estate of a patient, one Armin Karel Meier. An order was also claimed that the patient was entitled to inherit from his father's estate. It appeared that the patient, while mentally disturbed, had on May 18, 1977, shot and killed his father, in "an apparently unmotivated, cold-blooded shooting."&lt;ref&gt;156.&lt;/ref&gt; Utilising the maxim “waar daar geen skuld is nie, is daar geen stra nie”—where there is no fault, there is no punishment—the court held that the patient was not an ''indignus'', and that he lacked the criminal responsibility to be found guilty of the crime. Accordingly, he was entitled to inherit from his father's estate.

The matter was heard on January 18, 1980. The applicants' attorneys were Savage, Jooste &amp; Adams. MC de Klerk appeared for the applicant, PP Delport for the curator ''ad litem''.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4396">The '''Export Yellow Pages''' (EYP), was a multi-media trade and promotion resource for exporters that provides U.S. companies, exporters and export related service providers across all industries a convenient way to engage in [[export|export promotion]] and establish contacts and conduct business and trade around the globe with international buyers. Through the EYP, the Department of Commerce offers all U.S. companies and service providers a free online and print business directory listing and access to the directory and multi-media export. The Export Yellow Pages is located at http://www.exportyellowpages.com.

The Export Yellow Pages is no longer published.

==History==

The Export Yellow Pages was created in 1993 under the Bush Administration as a Public Private Partnership in partnership with Delphos International. Under its leadership of Bill Delphos and Donald Burley the publication was distributed worldwide to 210 countries with the US Department of Commerce and other government agencies distributing the directory to foreign buyers looking to purchase American made goods and services. 

The Export Yellow Pages print and online directory detailed products and services of over 27,000 U.S. companies representing over 65,000 business categories, as well as offers access to U.S. company executives, product catalogs, news and other export related information and resources. The website is no longer fully functional.

Connections and links to the Department of Commerce and other U.S. government international trade offices and agencies and resources are also presented at the Export Yellow Pages [http://www.exportyellowpages.com] to further assist U.S. companies and foreign buyers in navigating international trade opportunities and processes.  This website and searches on it may not reliably work anymore.

==Export Related Agencies==

* [[Department of Commerce]] (USDOC)

The mission of the USDOC is to "promote job creation and improved living standards for all Americans by creating an infrastructure that promotes economic growth, technological competitiveness, and sustainable development." Among its tasks are gathering economic and demographic data for business and government decision-making, issuing patents and trademarks, and helping to set industrial standards.

*[[International Trade Administration]] (ITA)

The International Trade Administration is an agency in the United States Department of Commerce that promotes United States exports of nonagricultural U.S. services and goods.

*[[Foreign Agricultural Service]] (FAS)

The Foreign Agricultural Service has primary responsibility for the [[United States Department of Agriculture]] (USDA) overseas programs—market development, international trade agreements and negotiations, and the collection of statistics and market information. The FAS assists U.S. exporters of agricultural products. It also administers USDA's export credit guarantee and food aid programs and helps increase income and food availability in developing nations by mobilizing expertise for agriculturally led economic growth. 

*[[Export-Import Bank of the United States]] (Ex-Im Bank)

Ex-Im Bank is the official export credit agency of the United States federal government. It is an independent agency in the Executive branch established by Congress in 1934 for the purposes of financing and insuring foreign purchases of United States goods for customers unable or unwilling to accept credit risk. ''The mission of the Bank is to create and sustain U.S. jobs by financing sales of U.S. exports to international buyers.'' Ex-Im Bank does not compete with private sector lenders, but rather provides financing for transactions that would otherwise not take place because commercial lenders are either unable or unwilling to accept the political or commercial risks inherent in the deal.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5520">{{About|The cookbook "Foods of the World"|World cuisines|Global cuisines}}

'''''Foods of the World''''' was a series of 27 [[cookbook]]s published by [[Time-Life]], beginning in 1968 and extending through the late 1970s, that provided a broad survey of many of the world's major [[cuisine]]s. The individual volumes were written by well-known experts on the various cuisines and included significant contemporary [[food writer]]s, including [[Craig Claiborne]], [[Pierre Franey]], [[James Beard]], [[Julia Child]], and [[M.F.K. Fisher]], and was overseen by food writer Michael Field who died before the series was complete. The series combined recipes with food-themed [[Travel_journal|travelogue]]s in an attempt to show the [[culture|cultural context]] from which each [[recipe]] sprang. 

Each volume came in two parts -- the main book was a large-format, photograph-heavy hardcover book, while extra [http://www.restodonte.com.br recipes] were presented in a spiralbound booklet with cover artwork to complement the main book. The individual volumes remain [[collecting|collector's items]] and are widely available on the secondhand market.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4788">"'''For a Swarm of Bees'''" is an [[Anglo-Saxon Metrical Charms|Anglo-Saxon metrical charm]] that was intended for use in keeping [[Western honey bee|honey bee]]s from [[Swarming (honey bee)|swarming]]. The text was discovered by [[John Mitchell Kemble]] in the 19th century.{{sfnp|Kemble|1876|pp=403-404}} The charm is named for its opening words, "''{{lang|ang|wiþ ymbe}}''", meaning "against (or towards) a swarm of bees".{{sfnp|Bosworth|1889}}

In the most often studied portion, towards the end of the text where the charm itself is located, the bees are referred to as ''{{lang|ang|sigewif}}'', "victory-women". The word has been associated by Kemble,{{sfnp|Kemble|1876|pp=403-404}} [[Jacob Grimm]], and other scholars with the notion of [[valkyries]] (Old English ''{{lang|ang|wælcyrian}}''), and "[[shield maiden]]s", hosts of female beings attested in [[Old Norse]] and, to a lesser extent, Old English sources, similar to or identical with the [[Idis (Germanic)|Idis]]e of the [[Merseburg Incantations]].{{sfnp|Davidson|1990|p=63}} Among some recent scholars the term has been theorized as a simple metaphor for the "victorious sword" (the stinging) of the bees.{{sfnp|Greenfield|1996|p=256}}

In 1909, the scholar Felix Grendon recorded what he saw as similarities between the charm and the [[Lorsch Bee Blessing]], a manuscript portion of the [[Lorsch Codex]], from the monastery in [[Lorsch]], Germany. Grendon suggested that the two could possibly have a common origin in pre-Christian Germanic culture.{{sfnp|Grendon|1909}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5244">The '''General Instruction of the Roman Missal''' ('''GIRM''')—in the [[Latin]] original, '''''Institutio Generalis Missalis Romani''''' ('''IGMR''')—is the detailed document governing the celebration of [[Mass (liturgy)|Mass]] of the [[Mass of Paul VI|ordinary form]] of the [[Roman Rite]] of the [[Roman Catholic Church|Catholic Church]] since 1969. It is printed at the start of recent editions of the [[Roman Missal]].

This document unified and replaced a number of documents that were printed in earlier editions:
* ''Rubricae Generales Missalis'' (General Rubrics of the Missal), amplified and revised by [[Pope Clement VIII]] in 1604 and completely rewritten by [[Pope John XXIII]] in 1960.&lt;ref&gt;Compare the text in the [http://www.musicasacra.com/pdf/missale62.pdf 1962 Missal] with that in the [http://www.sanctamissa.org/EN/resources/missale-romanum-pdf.html 1920 typical edition of the Missal]&lt;/ref&gt;
* ''Additiones et Variationes in Rubricis Missalis ad normam Bullae "Divino afflatu" et subsequentium S. R. C. decretorum'' (Additions and Variations to the Rubrics of the Missal in accordance with the Bull ''Divino afflatu'' and subsequent decrees of the Sacred Congregation of Rites), which existed in Missals printed only between 1920 and 1962.
* ''Ritus servandus in celebratione Missae'' (Rite to be observed in celebrating Mass), revised by Pope Clement VIII in 1604 and Pope John XXIII in 1962.

==Structure==
The ''General Instruction'' is arranged in nine chapters, preceded by a preamble. The chapter headings are:
# The Importance and Dignity of the Eucharistic Celebration
# The Structure of the Mass, Its Elements and Its Parts
# The Duties and Ministries in the Mass
# The Different Forms of Celebrating Mass
# The Arrangement and Furnishing of Churches for the Celebration of the Eucharist
# The Requisites for the Celebration of Mass
# The Choice of the Mass and Its Parts
# Masses and Prayers for Various Circumstances and Masses for the Dead
# Adaptations within the Competence of Bishops and Bishops' Conferences

==Importance==

 |archivedate=2015-01-14 
 |df= 
}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Pope Benedict XVI]] stressed the importance of proper knowledge of the ''General Instruction'' not only for priests but also for the laity: 
{{quotation|The eucharistic celebration is enhanced when priests and liturgical leaders are committed to making known the current liturgical texts and norms, making available the great riches found in the ''General Instruction of the Roman Missal'' and the ''Order of Readings for Mass''. Perhaps we take it for granted that our ecclesial communities already know and appreciate these resources, but this is not always the case. These texts contain riches which have preserved and expressed the faith and experience of the People of God over its two-thousand-year history.}}

The term "'''first-immigrant'''" refers to the very first immigrants or to the children of such an immigrant. The term '''second-generation''' consequently may refer to either the children or the grandchildren of such an immigrant. The terms are used interchangeably because of the ambiguity between them.

According to the [[Merriam–Webster's Dictionary of English Usage|Merriam-Webster's Dictionary]] a "First-generation" is
# "born in the U.S. -used of an American of immigrant parentage"
# "foreign-born -used of a naturalized citizen"

== First generation ==
The term '''first-generation''', as it pertains to a person's nationality or residency in a country, has two incompatible meanings:
*A [[jus soli|native-born]] citizen or resident of a country whose parents are foreign born, ''or'' a foreign-born citizen whose parents immigrated when that person was very young, that is, the first native-born generation.
*A [[foreign born]] citizen or resident who has immigrated to a new country of residence, that is, the first generation to immigrate.

This ambiguity is captured and corroborated in ''[[The Oxford English Dictionary]]''{{'}}s definition of "[[generation]]":

:''...designating a member of the first (or second, etc.) generation of a family to do something or live somewhere; spec. designating a '''naturalized immigrant or a descendant of immigrant parents''', esp. in the United States....'' (''OED'' definition of "generation," section 6b., the term "first generation" is used to refer to foreign-born residents (excluding those born abroad of American parents).&lt;ref name="U.S. Census Bureau"&gt;{{cite web|title=Nation's Foreign-Born Population Nears 37 Million |url=https://www.census.gov/newsroom/releases/archives/foreignborn_population/cb10-159.html |work=Press Release |publisher=U.S. Census Bureau |accessdate=31 January 2012 |deadurl=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

There is no universal consensus on which of these meanings is always intended.

== 1.5 generation ==
The term '''1.5 generation''' or '''''1.5G''''' refers to individuals who [[immigration|immigrate]] to a new country before or during their early [[adolescence|teens]]. They earn the label the "''1.5 generation''" because they bring with them or maintain characteristics from their home country, meanwhile engaging in assimilation and socialization with their new country. Oftentimes, in the case of small children, a battle of linguistic comprehension occurs between their academic language and the language spoken at home.&lt;ref&gt;Asher, C. (2011). "The progressive past: How history can help us serve generation 1.5". Reference &amp; User Service Quarterly, 51(1). 43–48.&lt;/ref&gt; Their identity is, thus, a combination of new and old culture and tradition.  Sociologist Ruben Rumbaut was among the first to use the term to examine outcomes among those arriving in the United States before adolescence, but since then the term has expanded to include foreign students, as well as other unique individuals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Rojas|first=Leslie Berenstein|title=Introducing the cultural mashup dictionary: Our first term, 1.5 generation|url=http://www.scpr.org/blogs/multiamerican/2011/04/07/7099/introducing-the-cultural-mashup-dictionary-our-fir/|work=Article|publisher=Southern California Public Radio|accessdate=31 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Depending on the age of immigration, the community where they settle, extent of education in their native country, and other factors, 1.5 generation individuals identify with their countries of origin to varying degrees. However, their identification is affected by their experiences growing up in the new country. 1.5G individuals are often bilingual and find it easier to assimilate into local culture and society than people who immigrate as adults.
Many 1.5 generation individuals also, become bi-cultural, combining both cultures - culture from the country of origin with the culture of the new country.

== Second generation ==
The term "'''second-generation'''" extends the concept of ''first-generation'' by one generation. As such, the term exhibits the same type of ambiguity as "first-generation," as well as additional ones.

Like "first-generation immigrant," the term "second-generation" can refer to a member of either:
*The second generation of a family to inhabit, but the first natively born in, a country, ''or''
*The second generation born in a country

In the United States, among demographers and other social scientists, [[Second-generation immigrants in the United States|"second generation"]] refers to the U.S.-born children of foreign-born parents.&lt;ref name="U.S. Census Bureau"/&gt;

The term ''second-generation immigrant'' attracts criticism due to it being an [[oxymoron]]. Namely, critics say, a "second-generation immigrant" is not an immigrant, since being "second-generation" means that the person is born in the country and the person's ''parents'' are the immigrants in question. Generation labeling immigrants is further complicated by the fact that immigrant generations may not correspond to the genealogical generations of a family. For instance, if a family of two parents and their two adult children immigrate to a new country, members in both generations of this family may be considered "first generation" by the former definition, as both parents and children were foreign-born, adult, immigrants. Likewise, if the two parents had a third child later on, this child would be of a different immigrant generation from that of its siblings. For every generation, the factor of mixed-generation marriages further convolutes the issue, as a person may have immigrants at several different levels of his or her ancestry.

These ambiguities notwithstanding, generation labeling is frequently used in parlance, news articles [https://www.theglobeandmail.com/servlet/story/LAC.20070918.OECD18/TPStory/National], and reference articles without deliberate clarification of [[birthplace]] or [[naturalization]]. It may or may not be possible to determine, from context, which meaning is intended.

== 2.5 generation ==
When demographers and other social scientists in the United States use the term "second generation," they usually refer to people with one foreign-born parent. Likewise, Statistics Canada defines second generation persons as those individuals who were born in Canada and had at least one parent born outside
Canada.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www12.statcan.gc.ca/nhs-enm/2011/as-sa/99-010-x/99-010-x2011003_2-eng.cfm | title = Generation status: Canadian-born children of immigrants | last =Statistics Canada | date =2013 | publisher = Minister of Industry, Government of Canada | access-date = 2017-04-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some researchers have begun to question whether those with one native-born parent and those with no native-born parents should be lumped together, with evidence suggesting that there are significant differences in identities and various outcomes between the two groups.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Ramakrishnan|first=S.

== 1.75 and 1.25 generations ==
[[Rubén G. Rumbaut]] has coined the terminology "1.75 generation" and "1.25 generation" immigrants, for children who are closer to birth or full adulthood when they immigrate.&lt;ref name="rumbaut"&gt;Rumbaut, Rubén. ''Ages, Life Stages, and Generational Cohorts: Decomposing the Immigrant First and Second Generations in the United States. p. 1167’’ http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=1887924 Retrieved December 9, 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; Children who arrive in their early childhood (ages 0 to 5) are referred to as 1.75 generation immigrants since their experiences are closer to a true 2nd-generation immigrant who was born in the country they live in: they retain virtually no memory of their country of birth, were too young to go to school to learn to read or write in the parental language in the home country, typically learn the language of the country they immigrate to without an accent and are almost entirely socialized there. Children who arrive in their adolescent years (ages 13–17) are referred to as 1.25 generation immigrants because their experiences are closer to the first generation of immigrants adults than to the native born second generation.&lt;ref name="rumbaut" /&gt;

== Factors lead to immigrant generations' accomplishments ==
Most immigrant youth tends to have higher academic accomplishment at all levels, at times even having greater levels of [[post-secondary education]] than their parents and grandparents.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Marks|first=Amy K.|last2=Ejesi|first2=Kida|last3=[[Cynthia García Coll|García Coll]]|first3=Cynthia|date=2014-06-01|title=Understanding the U.S. Immigrant Paradox in Childhood and Adolescence|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/cdep.12071/abstract|journal=Child Development Perspectives|language=en|volume=8|issue=2|pages=59–64|doi=10.1111/cdep.12071|issn=1750-8606}}&lt;/ref&gt; In order to explain this phenomenon, there are several factors that are noticeable:
# Immigrant children usually have more in the way of family obligation than children not born of immigrants, so they are more likely feel pressure to study seriously at school and gain the ability to provide for their relatives.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Geel|first=Mitch van|last2=Vedder|first2=Paul|date=2009-10-27|title=The Role of Family Obligations and School Adjustment in Explaining the Immigrant Paradox|url=https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10964-009-9468-y|journal=Journal of Youth and Adolescence|language=en|volume=40|issue=2|pages=187–196|doi=10.1007/s10964-009-9468-y|issn=0047-2891|pmc=3018245|pmid=19859793}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Imperial War Museums''' ('''IWM''') is a [[United Kingdom|British]] [[national museum]] organisation with branches at five locations in [[England]], three of which are in [[London]]. Founded as the Imperial War Museum in 1917, the museum was intended to record the civil and military war effort and sacrifice of Britain and [[British Empire|its Empire]] during the [[First World War]]. The museum's remit has since expanded to include all conflicts in which British or Commonwealth forces have been involved since 1914. As of 2012, the museum aims "to provide for, and to encourage, the study and understanding of the history of modern war and 'wartime experience'."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.iwm.org.uk/corporate |title=About us |author=Imperial War Museums |work=iwm.org.uk |accessdate=28 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Originally housed in [[the Crystal Palace]] at [[Sydenham Hill]], the museum opened to the public in 1920. In 1924, the museum moved to space in the [[Imperial Institute]] in [[South Kensington]], and finally in 1936, the museum acquired a permanent home that was previously the [[Bethlem Royal Hospital]] in [[Southwark]]. The outbreak of the [[Second World War]] saw the museum expand both its collections and its terms of reference, but in the post-war period, the museum entered a period of decline. The 1960s saw the museum redevelop its Southwark building, now referred to as Imperial War Museum London, which serves as the organisation's corporate [[headquarters]]. During the 1970s, the museum began to expand onto other sites. The first, in 1976, was a historic airfield in [[Cambridgeshire]] now referred to as [[Imperial War Museum Duxford|IWM Duxford]]. In 1978, the [[Royal Navy]] cruiser {{HMS|Belfast|C35|6}} became a branch of the museum, having previously been preserved for the nation by a private trust. In 1984, the [[Cabinet War Rooms]], an underground wartime command centre, was opened to the public. From the 1980s onwards, the museum's Bethlem building underwent a series of multimillion-pound redevelopments, completed in 2000. Finally, 2002 saw the opening of [[Imperial War Museum North|IWM North]] in [[Trafford]], [[Greater Manchester]], the fifth branch of the museum and the first in the north of England. In 2011, the museum rebranded itself as IWM, standing for "Imperial War Museums".

The museum's collections include [[archives]] of personal and official documents, [[photographs]], [[film]] and [[video]] material, and [[oral history]] recordings, an extensive [[library]], a large [[art]] collection, and examples of military vehicles and aircraft, equipment, and other artefacts.

The museum is funded by government grants, charitable donations, and revenue generation through commercial activity such as retailing, licensing, and publishing. General admission is free to IWM London (although specific exhibitions require the purchase of a ticket) and IWM North, but an admission fee is levied at the other branches. The museum is an [[exempt charity]] under the Charities Act 1993 and a [[non-departmental public body]] under the [[Department for Culture, Media and Sport]]. As of January 2012, the Chairman of the Trustees is [[Francis Richards (diplomat)|Sir Francis Richards]]. Since October 2008, the museum's Director General has been [[Diane Lees]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = https://museu.ms/museum/details/436/imperial-war-museum-london|title = Imperial War Museum London|date = |access-date = |website = Museums - The World Museums Network|publisher = |last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

===Establishment: 1917–1924===
[[File:Alfred Mond.jpg|alt=Head and shoulders shot of a bald, moustached man looking into the camera.|thumb|Sir Alfred Mond, photographed between 1910 and 1920.]]
On 27 February 1917 [[Alfred Mond, 1st Baron Melchett|Sir Alfred Mond]], a Liberal MP and First Commissioner of Works, wrote to the Prime Minister [[David Lloyd George]] to propose the establishment of a National War Museum. This proposal was accepted by the [[War cabinet#United Kingdom|War Cabinet]] on 5 March 1917 and the decision announced in [[The Times]] on 26 March. A committee was established, chaired by Mond, to oversee the collection of material to be exhibited in the new museum.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |issn=0022-0094 |author=Kavanagh, Gaynor |journal=[[Journal of Contemporary History]] |title=Museum as Memorial: The origins of the Imperial War Museum |volume=23 |issue=1 |date=January 1988 |jstor=260869 |pages=77–97 [81] |doi=10.1177/002200948802300105}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;'National War Museum. The Collection of Relics And Souvenirs', ''The Times'', 26 March 1917  Issue 41436, page 5 column C&lt;/ref&gt;

This National War Museum Committee set about collecting material to illustrate Britain's war effort by dividing into subcommittees examining such subjects as the Army, the Navy, the production of [[munitions]], and [[Women's roles in the World Wars|women's war work]].&lt;ref&gt;Kavanagh 1988 p.82&lt;/ref&gt; There was an early appreciation of the need for exhibits to reflect personal experience in order to prevent the collections becoming dead relics. [[Martin Conway, 1st Baron Conway of Allington|Sir Martin Conway]], the Museum's first Director General, said that exhibits must 'be vitalised by contributions expressive of the action, the experiences, the valour and the endurance of individuals'.&lt;ref&gt;Kavanagh 1988 p.83&lt;/ref&gt; The museum's first [[curator]] and secretary was [[Charles ffoulkes]], who had previously been curator of the [[Royal Armouries]] at the [[Tower of London]].&lt;ref&gt;James Mann, ‘ffoulkes, Charles John (1868–1947)’, rev. William Reid, ''Oxford Dictionary of National Biography'', Oxford University Press, 2004; online edn, Oct 2006 [http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/33120, accessed 22 June 2009]&lt;/ref&gt; In July 1917 Mond made a visit to the [[Western Front (World War I)|Western Front]] in order to study how best to organise the museum's growing collection. While in France he met French government ministers, and [[Douglas Haig, 1st Earl Haig|Field Marshal Haig]], who reportedly took great interest in his work.&lt;ref&gt;'The War Museum. Sir Alfred Mond's visit to the front', ''The Times'', 24 July 1917, Issue 41538, page 3 column C&lt;/ref&gt; In December 1917 the name was changed to the ''Imperial'' War Museum after a resolution from the India and Dominions Committee of the museum.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/?id=v76LEm-Tc2wC&amp;pg=PA145&amp;dq=history+of++Imperial+War+Museum#v=onepage&amp;q=Interim%20Report%20Crawford%20Committee&amp;f=false |title=Museums and the First World War |page=137 |author=Kavanagh, Gaynor |publisher=Continuum International Publishing Group |year=1994|isbn=0-7185-1713-X |accessdate=30 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The museum was opened by King [[George V]] at [[the Crystal Palace]] on 9 June 1920. During the opening ceremony, Sir Alfred Mond addressed the King on behalf of the committee, saying that 'it was hoped to make the museum so complete that every one who took part in the war, however obscurely, would find therein an example or illustration of the sacrifice he or she made' and that the museum 'was not a monument of military glory, but a record of toil and sacrifice'.&lt;ref&gt;'The Greatest War Memorial. Opening by the King. Human Interest at the Crystal Palace'. ''The Times'', 10 June 1920, Issue 42433, page 11 column D&lt;/ref&gt; Shortly afterwards the Imperial War Museum Act 1920 was passed and established a Board of Trustees to oversee the governance of the museum. To reflect the museum's Imperial remit the board included appointees of the governments of [[India]], [[South Africa]], [[Canada]], [[Australia]] and [[New Zealand]].&lt;ref name="iwm1920"/&gt; While the Act was being debated, some [[Parliament of the United Kingdom|Parliamentarians]] felt that the museum would perpetuate an undesirable war spirit and [[Joseph Kenworthy, 10th Baron Strabolgi|Commander Joseph Kenworthy]] MP said that he would 'refuse to vote a penny of public money to commemorate such suicidal madness of civilisation as that which was shown in the late War'.&lt;ref&gt;Hansard, 12 April 1920 ''Imperial War Museum Bill'' HC Deb 12 April 1920 vol 127 cc1465-9 [http://hansard.millbanksystems.com/commons/1920/apr/12/imperial-war-museum-bill Hansard 1803–2005] Accessed 22 March 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; On the [[August Bank Holiday]] 1920, the first public holiday since the museum's opening, 94,179 visitors were received,&lt;ref name="tpyf"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.theirpast-yourfuture.org.uk/upload/pdf/Imperial_War_Museum_-_HN.pdf |title=Learning Resources for Teaching History – Key Stages 3 and 4 – The Imperial War Museum |author=Their Past Your Future |date= |work= |publisher=Imperial War Museum |accessdate=18 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; and by November 1921, 2,290,719 had visited the museum.&lt;ref&gt;'Public And Crystal Palace. Full Benefit Later', ''The Times'', 15 November 1921, Issue 42878, page 5 column D&lt;/ref&gt;

===Relocation 1924–1936===
In 1924 the museum moved to the [[Imperial Institute]] building (demolished in the 1950s and 1960s to make way for [[Imperial College]]) in South Kensington. While this location was more central and in a prestigious area for museums, the accommodation itself proved cramped and inadequate&lt;ref&gt;'The Imperial War Museum: Lack of Accommodation',''The Times'' 25 August 1933 Issue 46532, page 13 column E&lt;/ref&gt; and in 1936 a new permanent location was found south of the [[River Thames]] in Southwark.

[[File:Imperial Institute.jpg|thumb|left|The Imperial Institute, South Kensington, where the museum was located from 1924–1936]]

The building, designed by [[James Lewis (architect)|James Lewis]]&lt;ref&gt;Peter Leach, ‘Lewis, James (1750/51–1820)’, Oxford Dictionary of National Biography, Oxford University Press, 2004 [http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/37672 Accessed 12 March 2009]&lt;/ref&gt; was the former Bethlem Royal Hospital which had been vacated following the hospital's relocation to Beckenham in Kent. The site was owned by [[Harold Harmsworth, 1st Viscount Rothermere|Lord Rothermere]], who had originally intended to demolish the building entirely in order to provide a public park in what was a severely overcrowded area of London. Eventually the central portion of the hospital building was retained while its two extensive wings were removed and the resulting space named [[Geraldine Mary Harmsworth Park]], after Lord Rothermere's mother. Sir Martin Conway described the building as '...a fine building, really quite noble building, with a great portico, a distinguishing dome, and two great wings added to it for the accommodation of lunatics no longer required. This particular building can be made to contain our collection admirably, and we shall preserve from destruction quite a fine building which otherwise will disappear'.&lt;ref&gt;Conway was addressing the [[House of Lords]] and his words recorded in [[Hansard]]. Quoted in {{cite journal |author1=Cooke, Steven |author2=Jenkins, Lloyd |date=December 2001 |title=Discourses of Regeneration in Early Twentieth-Century Britain: From Bedlam to the Imperial War Museum |journal=Area |volume=33 |issue=4 |publisher=Blackwell Publishing for The Royal Geographical Society |jstor=20004179 |issn=0004-0894 |pages=382–390 [387] |doi=10.1111/1475-4762.00044}}&lt;/ref&gt; The 'distinguishing dome' was added by [[Sydney Smirke]] in 1846 and housed the hospital's chapel.&lt;ref&gt;''Imperial War Museum London'' (guidebook), (London: Imperial War Museum, 2009) pp. 5 {{ISBN|978-1-904897-95-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; The museum was reopened by the Duke of York (later [[King George VI]]) in its new accommodation on 7 July 1936.

===Second World War and after: 1939–1966===
With the outbreak of the [[World War II|Second World War]] in 1939, the museum began to collect material documenting the conflict.&lt;ref&gt;’Imperial War Museum: Collection of war relics’, ''The Times'' 14 May 1940 Issue 48615, page 4 column F&lt;/ref&gt; In November 1939, during the so-called '[[Phoney War]]', the museum appeared in the opening sequence of the [[GPO Film Unit]] production ''The First Days'', in which children are seen playing on some of the museum's German artillery pieces captured during the First World War.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

The museum refused, however, to return some historic items such as a naval gun from [[HMS Lance (1914)|HMS ''Lance'']] (which had fired Britain's first shot of the First World War) or a gun served by [[Victoria Cross]]-winning boy seaman [[Jack Cornwell]].&lt;ref name="charman103"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Charman |first1=Terry |title=''A Museum of Man's Greatest Lunatic Folly: The Imperial War Museum and its Commemoration of the Great War 1917–2008'' in A Part of History: Aspects of the British Experience of the First World War |year=2008 |publisher=Continuum  |location=London |isbn=978-0-8264-9813-7 |page=103}}&lt;/ref&gt; The museum initially remained open but was closed for the duration of the war in September 1940 with the onset of [[the Blitz]]. On 31 January 1941 the museum was struck by a [[Luftwaffe]] bomb which fell on the naval gallery. A number of ship models were damaged by the blast and a [[Short Type 184|Short Seaplane]], which had flown at the [[Battle of Jutland]], was destroyed.&lt;ref name="IWMLguide2"&gt;''Imperial War Museum London'' (guidebook), (London: Imperial War Museum, 2009) pp. 2 {{ISBN|978-1-904897-95-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; While closed to the public the museum's building was used for a variety of purposes connected to the war effort, such as a repair garage for government motor vehicles, a centre for Air Raid Precautions civil defence lectures and a fire fighting training school.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

|title=Reopening of the Imperial War Museum, London after the Second World War 1946 (D 29420, caption)}}&lt;/ref&gt; In October 1945 the museum mounted a temporary exhibition, the first since the end of the war in August, which showcased technologies developed by the [[Petroleum Warfare Department]]. These included the submarine fuel pipeline [[Operation Pluto|PLUTO]], the fog dispersal method [[Fog Investigation and Dispersal Operation|FIDO]], and flame weapons such as the [[Churchill Crocodile]] and Wasp [[Universal Carrier]].&lt;ref&gt;'Petroleum Warfare Exhibition: Secrets Of Crocodile And Wasp', ''The Times'', 5 October 1945, Issue 50265, page 7 column D&lt;/ref&gt; However, due to bomb damage to both the building and exhibits, the museum was obliged to reopen its galleries piecemeal. The museum reopened a portion of its galleries in November 1946.&lt;ref name="IWMLguide2"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Imperial War Museum page 7"&gt;'Imperial War Museum: Memorial and Record Of Deeds In Two World Wars', ''The Times'' 31 January 1953 Issue 52534, page 7 column E&lt;/ref&gt; A third of the galleries were opened in 1948 and a further wing opened in 1949.&lt;ref&gt;'New Exhibits In War Museum Galleries Reopened',''The Times'',  31 August 1948, Issue 51164, page 6 column E&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;‘Relics Of Two World Wars Museum Wing Reopened’, ''The Times'', 23 February 1949, Issue 51313, page 6 column E&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1953, with Commonwealth forces engaged in [[Korean war|Korea]] and [[Malayan Emergency|Malaya]] the museum began its current policy of collecting material from all modern conflicts in which British or Commonwealth forces were involved.&lt;ref name="IWMLguide2"/&gt; However, despite this expansion of remit, the early postwar period was a period of decline for the museum. Dr Noble Frankland, the museum's Director from 1960 to 1982, described the museum's galleries in 1955 as appearing 'dingy and neglected [and in a] dismal state of decay' the museum's 'numerous stunning exhibits' notwithstanding.&lt;ref&gt;Frankland, Noble (1998) ''History at War: The Campaigns of an Historian'' (London: Giles de la Mare) p. 160 {{ISBN|978-1-900357-10-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Redevelopment and expansion: 1966–2012===
[[File:15inchgunsatImperialWarMuseumLondon.jpg|thumb|15-inch guns outside the museum; the nearer gun from [[HMS Ramillies (07)|HMS ''Ramillies'']], the other from [[HMS Resolution (09)|HMS ''Resolution'']].]]
In 1966 the Museum's Southwark building was extended to provide collections storage and other facilities, the first major expansion since the Museum had moved to the site. The development also included a purpose-built cinema.&lt;ref&gt;'Cinema For War Films Opens', ''The Times'', 2 November 1966, Issue  56778, page 16 column B&lt;/ref&gt; In 1967 the museum acquired a pair of [[BL 15 inch Mk I naval gun|15-inch naval guns]]. One had been mounted on the [[Royal Navy]]'s [[HMS Ramillies (07)|HMS ''Ramillies'']] and the other on both [[HMS Resolution (09)|HMS ''Resolution'']] and [[HMS Roberts (F40)|HMS ''Roberts'']]. Both had been fired in action during the Second World War. They went on permanent display outside the museum in May 1968.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://archive.iwm.org.uk/server/show/ConWebDoc.2492 |title=Naval guns, 15-inch |author=Imperial War Museum |date= |work=archive.iwm.org.uk |publisher= |accessdate=25 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The acquisition of these guns, representative of the [[dreadnought]] era of British [[battleship]]s, led the museum to seek to acquire a [[BL 6 inch Mk XXIII naval gun|6-inch]] triple turret that would be representative of a number of classes of British [[cruiser]]s.&lt;ref name="Wingate101"&gt;{{cite book |title=In Trust for the Nation: HMS Belfast 1939–1972 |last=Wingate |first=John |authorlink= |coauthors= |year=2004 |publisher=Imperial War Museum |location=London |isbn=1-901623-72-6 |page=101}}&lt;/ref&gt; This would eventually lead to the preservation of the Royal Navy [[light cruiser]] {{HMS|Belfast|C35|6}}, which became a branch of the museum in 1978.&lt;ref&gt;Wingate 2004, p.101–102&lt;/ref&gt;

Later in 1968 on 13 October the Museum was attacked by an [[arsonist]], Timothy John Daly, who claimed he was acting in protest against the exhibition of [[militarism]] to children. He caused damage valued at approximately £200,000, not counting the loss of irreplaceable books and documents. On his conviction in 1969 he was sentenced to four years in prison.&lt;ref&gt;Marshall, Rita 'War museum damaged by arson', ''The Times'' 14 October 1968, Issue no. 57381, p. 1&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;'Museum fire youth gets four years', ''The Times'', 23 January 1969, Issue 57466, page 3 column G&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1969 RAF Duxford, a [[Royal Air Force]] fighter airfield in [[Cambridgeshire]] was declared surplus to requirements by the [[Ministry of Defence (United Kingdom)|Ministry of Defence]]. Needing further space, the museum duly requested permission to use part of the site as temporary storage. The entire site was later transferred to the museum in February 1976 and Duxford, now referred to as [[Imperial War Museum Duxford]] became the museum's first branch.&lt;ref name=Frankland&gt;{{cite book | last = Frankland | first = Noble | title = History at War | publisher = Giles de la Mare | location = London | year = 1999 | isbn = 978-1-900357-10-4 | pages = 205–208 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Also during the 1970s the government raised the possibility of the museum taking over the historic [[Cabinet War Rooms]] in [[Whitehall]]. The museum was reluctant due to its new commitments related to Duxford and HMS ''Belfast'', but agreed in 1982.&lt;ref name="Holmes"/&gt;

By 1983 the museum was again looking to redevelop the Southwark site and approached engineering firm [[Arup Group Limited|Arup]] to plan a phased programme of works that would expand the building's exhibition space, provide appropriate environmental controls to protect collections, and improve facilities for visitors. The following year, in April 1984, the Cabinet War Rooms were opened to the public as a branch of the museum.

The first phase of the works to the Southwark building started in 1986 and were completed in 1989, during which time the museum was closed to the public. The work included the conversion of what was previously the hospital's courtyard into a centrepiece Large Exhibits Gallery. This gallery featured a strengthened ground floor (to support the weight of very heavy exhibits), a first floor [[mezzanine (architecture)|mezzanine]] and second storey viewing balcony. Into this space were placed tanks, artillery pieces, vehicles, ordnance and aircraft from the First World War to the [[Falklands War]].&lt;ref name=arupjournal&gt;{{cite journal

The following year, 2000, the final phase of the Southwark redevelopment was completed. The development included the installation of the museum's ''Holocaust Exhibition'' which was opened by the Queen on 6 June 2000. This was the first permanent exhibition dedicated to the [[Holocaust]] in a UK museum; its development had taken five years at a cost of £5 million.&lt;ref&gt;For details of the development process of the Holocaust Exhibition see {{cite journal |last1=Bardgett |first1=Suzanne |last2= |first2= |date=June 2000 |title=Exhibiting Hatred |journal=History Today |volume=50 |issue=6 |pages=18–21 |publisher= |doi= |issn=0018-2753 |url= |accessdate= }}.&lt;/ref&gt; Two years later, in July 2002, Imperial War Museum North was opened.

====Architecture and layout====
[[File:BethlemSteelEngraving1828.png|thumb|A view of [[Bethlem Royal Hospital]] in 1828]]
The museum has occupied the former Bethlem Royal Hospital on [[Lambeth Road]] since 1936. The hospital building was designed by the hospital surveyor, James Lewis, from plans submitted by [[John Peter Gandy|John Gandy]] and other architects, and construction completed in October 1814. The hospital consisted of a range of buildings 580 feet long with a basement and three storeys, parallel to [[Lambeth Road]], with a central entrance under a [[portico]].&lt;ref name=britishhistoryonline/&gt;

The building was substantially altered in 1835 by architect [[Sydney Smirke]]. In order to provide more space, he added blocks at either end of the frontage, and galleried wings on either side of the central portion. He also added a small single-storey lodge, still in existence, at the [[Lambeth Road]] gate. Later, between 1844–46, the central [[cupola]] was replaced with a copper-clad dome in order to expand the [[chapel]] beneath. The building also featured a theatre in a building to the rear of the site.&lt;ref name=britishhistoryonline&gt;
{{cite book |editor1-first=Ida |editor1-last=Darlington |title=[[Survey of London]]: volume 25: St George's Fields (The parishes of St. George the Martyr Southwark and St. Mary Newington)

The building remained substantially unchanged until vacated by the hospital in 1930. After the [[Freehold (English law)|freehold]] was purchased by [[Lord Rothermere]], the wings were demolished to leave the original central portion (with the dome now appearing disproportionately tall) and Smirke's later wings. When the museum moved into the building in 1936 the ground floor of the central portion was occupied by the principal art gallery, with the east wing housing the Naval gallery and the west wing the Army gallery. The Air Force gallery was housed in the former theatre. The first floor comprised further art galleries (including rooms dedicated to [[Sir William Orpen]] and [[Sir John Lavery]]), a gallery on [[Women's roles in the World Wars|women's war work]], and exhibits relating to transport and signals. The first floor also housed the museum's photograph collection. The second floor housed the museum's library in its west wing, and in the east wing the [[map]] collection and stored pictures and drawings.&lt;ref&gt;'War Museum in Its New Home – Arrangement of the Exhibits', ''The Times'' 16 June 1936, Issue 47402, page 14 column B&lt;/ref&gt; This division of exhibits by service, and by civil or military activity, persisted until a wide-ranging redisplay of the galleries from the 1960s onwards. In September 1972 the building received Grade II [[listed building]] status.&lt;ref&gt;{{NHLE |num=1385640 |desc=Imperial War Museum |date= |accessdate=8 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The original hospital building is now largely occupied by corporate offices. The 1966 extension houses the library, art store, and document archives while the 1980s redevelopments created exhibition space over five floors. The first stage created 8,000&amp;nbsp;m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; of gallery space of which 4,600&amp;nbsp;m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; was new, and the second provided a further 1,600&amp;nbsp;m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;ref name=arupjournal/&gt; The final phase, the Southwest Infill, was partly funded by a £12.6 million grant from the [[Heritage Lottery Fund]]&lt;ref&gt;Heritage Lottery Fund – [http://www.hlf.org.uk/NR/rdonlyres/B85BA647-2141-45B9-9E64-6797848763E2/0/10WW2FACTSHEET.pdf Second World War 60 Years On: remembering, learning, commemorating] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090325204433/http://www.hlf.org.uk/NR/rdonlyres/B85BA647-2141-45B9-9E64-6797848763E2/0/10WW2FACTSHEET.pdf |date=25 March 2009 }} Accessed 10 March 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; and provided 5,860m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; of gallery space and educational facilities over six floors.&lt;ref&gt;Duncan, Sue (29 November 2001) ''The Architects' Journal'' [http://www.architectsjournal.co.uk/home/sensitive-choices/185822.article Sensitive choices]. Retrieved 14 July 2009&lt;/ref&gt; Before the 2013-14 redevelopment, the basement was occupied by permanent galleries on the First and Second World Wars, and of conflicts after 1945. The ground floor comprised the atrium, cinema, temporary exhibition spaces, and visitor facilities. The first floor included the atrium mezzanine, education facilities, and a permanent gallery, ''Secret War'', exploring [[special forces]], [[espionage]] and [[covert operation]]s. The second floor included the atrium viewing balcony, two art galleries, a temporary exhibition area and the permanent ''Crimes against Humanity'' exhibition. The third floor housed the permanent ''Holocaust Exhibition'', and the fourth floor, a [[vault (architecture)|vaulted]] roof space, accommodated the Lord Ashcroft Gallery. Opened in November 2010 the gallery exhibits the museum's [[Victoria Cross]] (VC) and [[George Cross]] collection, alongside the private VC collection amassed by [[Michael Ashcroft, Baron Ashcroft|Michael Ashcroft]], 241 medals in total.&lt;ref name=arupjournal/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Imperial War Museum (2009) [http://london.iwm.org.uk/upload/pdf/IWML_Floorplan_August_09.pdf Imperial War Museum London map] Accessed 12 April 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.culture24.org.uk/history+%26+heritage/war+%26+conflict/art312514 |title=Extraordinary stories revealed as the Imperial War Museum opens The Lord Ashcroft Gallery |first=Richard |last=Moss |date=9 November 2010 |publisher=[[Culture24]] |accessdate=12 November 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====All Saints Annexe====
In 1989 the museum acquired the All Saints Annexe, a former hospital building in Austral Street off [[West Square]]. The 1867 building, which backs onto [[Geraldine Mary Harmsworth Park]], was originally an orphanage opened by local [[philanthropist]] [[Charlotte Sharman]], then later used as a hospital. It houses the museum's photographic, film and sound archives, and offices.&lt;ref&gt;Archives in London and the M25 Area [http://www.aim25.ac.uk/cgi-bin/vcdf/detail?coll_id=11830&amp;inst_id=118&amp;nv1=search&amp;nv2= All Saints Hospital].

The site accommodates a number of [[British Army]] regimental museums, including those of the [[Parachute Regiment (United Kingdom)|Parachute Regiment]] and the [[Royal Anglian Regiment]].

Based on the historic [[Duxford Aerodrome]], the site was originally operated by the [[Royal Air Force]] (RAF)  during the [[First World War]]. During the [[Second World War]] Duxford played a prominent role during the [[Battle of Britain]] and was later used by [[United States Army Air Forces]] fighter units in support of the [[Strategic bombing during World War II#US bombing in Europe|daylight bombing]] of Germany. Duxford remained an active RAF airfield until 1961. Many of Duxford's original buildings, such as [[hangar]]s used during the Battle of Britain, are still in use. A number of these buildings are of architectural or historic significance and over thirty have [[listed building]] status.&lt;ref name=IWMDhistoric&gt;Imperial War Museum Duxford (2009) [http://duxford.iwm.org.uk/server/show/ConWebDoc.5713 Historic Duxford] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091001151237/http://duxford.iwm.org.uk/server/show/ConWebDoc.5713 |date=1 October 2009 }}. Retrieved 15 September 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; The site also features a number of purpose-built exhibition buildings, such as the [[Stirling Prize]]-winning American Air Museum, designed by [[Norman Foster (architect)|Sir Norman Foster]]. The site remains an active airfield and is used by a number of civilian flying companies, and hosts regular [[air show]]s. The site is operated in partnership with [[Cambridgeshire County Council]] and the Duxford Aviation Society, a charity formed in 1975 to preserve [[civil aircraft]] and promote appreciation of British civil aviation history.

===HMS ''Belfast'' (1938)===
{{Main|HMS Belfast (C35)}}
[[File:Hms belfast.jpg|thumb|left|HMS ''Belfast'' at her berth in the [[Pool of London]]]] HMS ''Belfast'', a [[Town class cruiser (1936)|Town class cruiser]], was launched in 1938 and served throughout the [[Second World War]], participating in the December 1943 [[Battle of North Cape]] and firing some of the first shots of [[Operation Overlord]], the Allied invasion of Normandy in June 1944. She saw further combat in the [[Korean War]]. Expected to be disposed of as scrap after she was decommissioned in 1963, in 1967 efforts were initiated to preserve ''Belfast'' as a museum ship. A joint committee of the Imperial War Museum, the [[National Maritime Museum]] and the [[Ministry of Defence (UK)|Ministry of Defence]] was established, and reported in June 1968 that preservation was practical. In 1971 the government decided against preservation, prompting the formation of the private HMS ''Belfast'' Trust to campaign for her to be saved for the nation. The Trust was successful in its efforts, and the government transferred the ship to the Trust in July 1971. Brought to London, she was moored on the [[River Thames]] near [[Tower Bridge]] in the [[Pool of London]]. Opened to the public in October 1971 ''Belfast'' became a branch of the Imperial War Museum on 1 March 1978, being acknowledged by the then [[Secretary of State for Education and Science]], [[Shirley Williams]], as "a unique demonstration of an important phase of our history and technology".&lt;ref&gt;

===Churchill War Rooms===

[[File:MapRoomCabinetWarRoomsTrim.jpg|thumb|The Map Room of the [[Churchill Museum and Cabinet War Rooms|Cabinet War Rooms]]]]
The Cabinet War Rooms is an underground complex that served as a British government command centre throughout the Second World War. Located beneath the [[HM Treasury|Treasury]] building in the [[Whitehall]] area of [[Westminster]], the facilities became operational in 1939 and were in constant use until their abandonment in August 1945 after the [[surrender of Japan]]. Their historical value was recognised early on, and the public were able to visit by appointment. However, the practicalities of allowing public access to a site beneath a working government office meant that only 4,500 of 30–40,000 annual applicants to visit the War Rooms could be admitted.&lt;ref name=Holmes&gt;Holmes, Richard (2009) ''Churchill’s Bunker: The Secret Headquarters at the Heart of Britain’s Victory'' (London: Profile Books Ltd) p. 193 {{ISBN|978-1-84668-225-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; The museum agreed to take over the administration of the site in 1982,&lt;ref name=Holmes/&gt; a development keenly supported by the then Prime Minister [[Margaret Thatcher]], an admirer of Britain's wartime Prime Minister [[Winston Churchill]]. Thatcher opened the War Rooms in April 1984. In 2003 a further suite of rooms, used as accommodation by Churchill, his wife and close associates, were added to the museum. The restoration of these rooms, which since the war had been stripped out and used for storage, cost £7.5 million.&lt;ref&gt;Kennedy, Maev (9 April 2003) ''[[The Guardian]]'' [https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2003/apr/09/arts.past Restored underground apartments opened to public].

The development of the Churchill Museum cost a further £6 million. The centrepiece is a 15m interactive table which enables visitors to access digitised material, particularly from the [[Churchill Archives Centre]], via an "electronic filing cabinet".&lt;ref&gt;Waterfield, Giles 'The Churchill Museum: Ministry of sound' ''Museum Practice'' No.30 (Summer 2005) pp. 18–21&lt;/ref&gt; The museum was renamed the Churchill War Rooms in 2010.

The Imperial War Museum North was opened in [[Trafford]], [[Greater Manchester]] in 2002. It was the first branch of the museum outside southeast England, and the first to be purpose-built as a museum. Designed by [[architect]] [[Daniel Libeskind]], Imperial War Museum North was his first building in Britain. Libeskind's building, overlooking the [[Manchester Ship Canal]] at [[Salford Quays]], was based on the concept of a [[globe]] shattered by conflict into shards and reassembled. These shards, representing earth, air and water, give the building its shape.&lt;ref&gt;Studio Daniel Libeskind [http://www.daniel-libeskind.com/projects/imperial-war-museum-north/ Imperial War Museum North] Accessed 16 July 2012&lt;/ref&gt; Originally budgeted at £40 million, the museum was eventually completed for £28.5 million after anticipated funding was not forthcoming.

The Imperial War Museum's original collections date back to the material amassed by the National War Museum Committee. The present departmental organisation came into being during the 1960s as part of Frankland's reorganisation of the museum. The 1970s saw [[oral history]] gain increasing prominence and in 1972 the museum created the Department of Sound Records (now the Sound Archive) to record interviews with individuals who had experienced the First World War.

===Databases===
The IWM has an online database, listing the various items which make up the IWM Collections. In some cases, there are images of the item, or contemporary photos, which can be shared and reused under a Creative Commons Licence.

The [[War Memorials Register]] is a database of known war memorials in the United Kingdom. Information material used in composition, the condition of the memorial, its address and coordinates with a satellite map plot are recorded for each of the memorials. There are over 70,000 memorials on the register. &lt;ref&gt; {{cite web|url=http://www.iwm.org.uk/corporate/projects-and-partnerships/war-memorials-register |title=War Memorials Register |publisher=Imperial War Museum |accessdate=9 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Whilst many memorials are commemorated to those who died in the First World War, &lt;ref&gt; {{cite web|url=http://www.greatwar.co.uk/organizations/ukniwm.htm |title=UK War Memorials Register  |publisher=The Great War 1914-1918 |accessdate=9 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; the scope of the project is all conflicts.

In 2014, IWM and online genealogy service provider [[Findmypast]] entered into a collaboration to launch the "Lives of the First World War" platform. During the centenary period, anyone can sign up for an account. Those who pay for a subscription have the ability to add records from Findmypast's collections.&lt;ref name="family-tree"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://family-tree.co.uk/2013/05/iwm-brightsolid-partner-to-create-lives-of-the-first-world-war-digital-memorial/ |title=IWM &amp;amp; brightsolid partner to create Lives of the First World War digital memorial - Family Tree |publisher=family-tree.co.uk |accessdate=2018-01-09 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141207230621/http://family-tree.co.uk/2013/05/iwm-brightsolid-partner-to-create-lives-of-the-first-world-war-digital-memorial/ |archive-date= 7 December 2014 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A number of sources (War Office medal index cards, Canadian Expeditionary Force attestations, Royal Navy service records etc.) have been used as seeding documents to create individual entries in the database. Each entry in the database - known as a Life Story - can be further built up, so as to document when that person was born, when they died, family members etc. If a Life Story needs to be added, or a duplicate exists that needs to be merged, this can be requested via a support forum manned by IWM volunteers. A user with a subscription has the ability to group Life Stories together into a "Community". This could be a grouping based around a ship's crew, a unit in the army, or the names of men and women buried in a given war cemetery.&lt;ref name="LivesKB"&gt;

The goal has been to encourage crowdsourcing to build up as many details as possible in the database, and to tap into the popularity of online genealogy as a pastime. One selling point of the platform has been that it is a "permanent digital memorial [that] will be saved for future generations."&lt;ref name="Lives"&gt;

==Governance==
The Imperial War Museum is an executive [[non-departmental public body]] under the [[Department for Culture, Media and Sport]], from which it receives financial support in the form of a [[grant-in-aid]]. The governance of the museum is the responsibility of a Board of Trustees, originally established by the Imperial War Museum Act 1920,&lt;ref name="iwm1920"&gt;[[Office of Public Sector Information]] [https://www.opsi.gov.uk/RevisedStatutes/Acts/ukpga/1920/cukpga_19200016_en_1 Revised Statute from The UK Statute Law Database: Imperial War Museum Act 1920 (c.16)].

The museum's Director-General is answerable to the trustees and acts as accounting officer. Since 1917 the museum has had six directors. The first was [[Martin Conway, 1st Baron Conway of Allington|Sir Martin Conway]], a noted art historian, [[mountaineer]] and explorer. He was [[Orders, decorations, and medals of the United Kingdom#Knighthood|knighted]] in 1895 for his efforts to map the [[Karakoram]] mountain range of the [[Himalayas]], and was [[Felix Slade|Slade]] Professor of Fine Arts at the [[University of Cambridge]] from 1901 to 1904. Conway held the post of Director until his death in 1937, when he was succeeded by Leslie Bradley. Bradley had served in the First World War in the [[Middlesex Regiment]] before being invalided out in 1917. He later became acquainted with Charles ffoulkes, who invited him to join the museum where he was initially engaged in assembling the museum's poster collection.&lt;ref&gt;'Mr L. R. Bradley: Former Director of Imperial War Museum' (obituary) ''The Times'' 30 January 1968 p. 8&lt;/ref&gt; Bradley retired in 1960 and was succeeded by Dr [[Noble Frankland]]. Frankland had served as a [[navigator]] in [[RAF Bomber Command]], winning a [[Distinguished Flying Cross (United Kingdom)|Distinguished Flying Cross]]. While a Cabinet Office official historian he co-authored a controversial official history of the [[Strategic bombing during World War II|RAF strategic air campaign]] against Germany. Frankland retired in 1982 and was succeeded by Dr [[Alan Borg]] who had previously been at the [[Sainsbury Centre for Visual Arts]]. In 1995 Borg moved to the [[Victoria and Albert Museum]] and was succeeded by Sir [[Robert Crawford (historian)|Robert Crawford]], who had originally been recruited by Frankland as a research assistant in 1968. Upon Crawford's retirement in 2008 he was succeeded by [[Diane Lees]], previously Director of the [[V&amp;A Museum of Childhood]]. She was noted in the media as the first woman appointed to lead a British [[National museum#United Kingdom|national museum]].&lt;ref&gt;Heal, Sharon (January 2008) 'New chief at IWM revealed' ''Museums Journal'' 108/1 p. 8&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''''International Encyclopedia of Unified Science''''' (IEUS) was a series of publications devoted to [[unified science]]. The IEUS was conceived at the [[Mundaneum]] Institute in [[The Hague]] in the 1930s,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Neurath |first=Otto |authorlink=Otto Neurath |date=1983 |origyear=1936 |chapter=An international encyclopedia of unified science |editor1-last=Cohen |editor1-first=Robert S. |editor2-last=Neurath |editor2-first=Marie |editor2-link=Marie Neurath |editor3-last=Fawcett |editor3-first=Carolyn R. |title=Philosophical papers, 1913–1946 |series=Vienna Circle collection |volume=16 |location=Dordrecht; Boston |publisher=[[D.

The IEUS was an output of the [[Vienna Circle]] to address the "growing concern throughout the world for the [[logic]], the [[history]], and the [[sociology]] of [[science]]..."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |editor1-last=Neurath |editor1-first=Otto |editor1-link=Otto Neurath |editor2-last=Carnap |editor2-first=Rudolf |editor2-link=Rudolf Carnap |editor3-last=Morris |editor3-first=Charles W. |editor3-link=Charles W.

{{See also|Vienna Circle#Congresses and publications}}
Creation of the IEUS was facilitated by the International Congresses for the Unity of Science organized by members of the Vienna Circle. After a preliminary conference in [[Prague]] in 1934, the First International Congress for the Unity of Science was held at the [[Sorbonne]], [[Paris]], 16–21 September 1935.&lt;ref name="Stadler"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Stadler |first1=Friedrich |title=The Vienna Circle: studies in the origins, development, and influence of logical empiricism |date=2015 |origyear=2001 |series=Vienna circle institute library |volume=4 |edition=Abridged and revised |publisher=[[Springer Verlag]] |location=Cham |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=2rAlCQAAQBAJ |doi=10.1007/978-3-319-16561-5 |isbn=9783319165608 |oclc=911018849 |accessdate=22 November 2017 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|171}} It was attended by about 170 people from over twenty different countries. With the active involvement of [[Kazimierz Ajdukiewicz]] (Poland), [[Susan Stebbing]] (England), and [[Federigo Enriques]] (Italy) the scope of the project for an IEUS was considerably expanded.&lt;ref name="Stadler"/&gt;{{rp|173}} The congress expressed its approval of the planned IEUS as proposed by the Mundaneum, and further set up a committee to plan future congresses.&lt;ref name="Stadler"/&gt;{{rp|173}} This committee included the following members:&lt;ref name="Stadler"/&gt;{{rp|173}}

==Influence==
Historian [[David Hollinger]] argued that the IEUS was a less comprehensive account of the sciences of the time than it could have been, and was especially weak in the [[social science]]s.&lt;ref name="Hollinger"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Hollinger |first=David A. |authorlink=David Hollinger |date=May 2011 |title=The unity of knowledge and the diversity of knowers: science as an agent of cultural integration in the United States between the two world wars |journal=[[Pacific Historical Review]] |volume=80 |issue=2 |pages=211–230 [216–217] |doi=10.1525/phr.2011.80.2.211}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hollinger noted that the ''[[Encyclopaedia of the Social Sciences]]'', published around the same time, provided a much more comprehensive account of the social sciences: "''The Encyclopedia of the Social Sciences'' (12 vols., New York, 1933–1937) was a prodigious endeavor brought to successful completion by [[Alvin Saunders Johnson|Alvin Johnson]]. This encyclopedia is a much more important episode in the history of thought than ''The International Encyclopedia of Unified Science'' yet has attracted much less attention from historians than the abortive enterprise led by Neurath."&lt;ref name="Hollinger"/&gt; Hollinger also said that the [[scholarly journal]] ''[[Philosophy of Science (journal)|Philosophy of Science]]'', founded in 1934, provided a much more inclusive perspective on the sciences in those years than did the IEUS.&lt;ref name="Hollinger"/&gt;

American political theorist [[James Burnham]] refers to the Encyclopedia in ''Science and Style: A Reply to Comrade Trotsky'' (1940), his penultimate tract discussing his differences with [[Leon Trotsky]] and marking Burnham's renouncement of [[dialectical materialism]]. In this text he responds to Trotsky's request to draw his attention to "those works which should supplant the system of dialectic materialism for the proletariat" by referring to ''[[Principia Mathematica]]'' by Russell and [[Alfred North Whitehead|Whitehead]] and "the scientists, mathematicians and logicians now cooperating in the new Encyclopedia of Unified Science".&lt;ref&gt;Burhham J. (1940a) ''Science and Style: A Reply to Comrade Trotsky'', in ''In Defence of Marxism'' by Leon Trotsky, London 1966, pp.232–256.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Kalfu''', '''Kalfou''' or '''Carrefour''' (literally ''[[Intersection (road)|crossroads]]'' - see [[crossroads (mythology)|crossroads in mythology]]) is one of the [[petro loa|petro]] aspects of the spirit [[Papa Legba]] in [[Haitian Vodou]]. He is often envisioned as a young man or as a demon; his color is red and he favors [[rum]] infused with [[gunpowder]]. He is often [[syncretism|syncretised]] with [[Satan]].

As his name indicates, he also controls the crossroads and has the power to grant or deny access to all other [[Loa]], or spirits, and he allows the "crossing" of bad [[luck]], deliberate destruction, misfortune, and injustices.&lt;ref&gt;Corbett, Bob. "Haiti: Short List of Loa." Haiti: Short List of Loa. N.p., n.d. Web. 20 Sept. 2013. [http://www2.webster.edu/~corbetre/haiti/voodoo/shortlist.htm Webster.edu]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Lickbarrow v Mason''' ((1788), 2 T.

The '''''Mingxin baojian''''' ({{zh|s=明心宝鉴 |t=明心寶鑑|p=Míngxīn bǎojiàn|w=''Ming-hsin pao-chien'' |l=bright heart-mind precious mirror}}) is an ancient [[China|Chinese]] book containing "a collection of aphorisms and quotations form the Chinese classics and other works"&lt;ref name="CAEMEA"&gt;
Léonard Blussé, Harriet Thelma Zurndorfer, Erik Zürcher, ''Conflict and accommodation in early modern East Asia'' (1993), p. 174.&lt;/ref&gt; The author and date of authorship are not reliably known, although later references suggest that it was compiled in 1393 by Fan Liben.&lt;ref name="CAEMEA"/&gt; The quotations and aphorisms in the book appear to be from scholarly writings of [[Confucianism]], [[Buddhism]], and [[Taoism]],&lt;ref name="Chan"/&gt; with "a great many of the quotations... taken from Taoist writings",&lt;ref name="Chan"/&gt; suggesting that the author was a follower of Taoism. 

The ''Mingxin baojian'' was the first book  translated from Chinese into a Western language.&lt;ref name="CAEMEA"/&gt; "The ''Ming-hsin pao-chien'' seems to have widely circulated among the people in [[Fujian|Fukien]] in the late Ming period. It was brought by the Chinese to the Philippines".&lt;ref name="Chan"&gt;Albert Chan, ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=-Om1o2fJVJsC&amp;pg=PA182&amp;dq=%22Ming-hsin%22&amp;hl=en#v=onepage&amp;q=%22Ming-hsin%22&amp;f=false Chinese books and documents in the Jesuit Archives in Rome]'' (2002), p. 180-83.&lt;/ref&gt; It was translated into Spanish by a Dominican friar named [[Juan Cobo]] who arrived in the [[Philippines]] in 1588.&lt;ref name="CAEMEA"/&gt; In 1595, the Dominicans presented this translation, along with a copy of the original, to [[Philip III of Spain]], then Crown Prince.&lt;ref name="Chan"/&gt; Prior to its acquisition by westerners, the work had already been translated and circulated in other Asian countries. It is known as the '''''Myeongsim Bogam''''' in [[Korean language|Korean]], and the '''''Minh tâm bửu giám''''' [[Vietnamese language|Vietnamese]]. It was included in ''[[The Chinese Repository]]'', translated by [[William Milne (missionary)|William Milne]].

'''Moore's Dublin Edition''' of ''Encyclopædia Britannica'' was an Irish printing of [[Encyclopædia Britannica Third Edition|''Encyclopædia Britannica'' Third Edition]], printed by James Moore of College Green, Dublin. The title pages are dated the year they were printed, in volume order from 1788 to 1797, as opposed to those of ''Britannica'', which were all dated 1797. This leads to the curious situation where the pirated version of a work has an earlier date than the original.

The number of copperplates is listed as "Near Five Hundred" while ''Britannica'' and ''[[Dobson's Encyclopaedia]]'' both say 542. Indeed, not all the plates were used. The volumes are board bound in leather and with the same high quality linen paper as ''Britannica''. They are corrected, in that each volume of ''Britannica'' has errata listed at the end of each, while Moore's has corrected them.

The '''''Mouvement de libération nationale du Québec''''' (MLNQ) is a secessionist group in [[Quebec]], [[Canada]], founded (in the wake of the [[1995 Quebec referendum|1995 referendum on Quebec sovereignty]]) by [[Front de libération du Québec]] (FLQ) founder, [[Raymond Villeneuve]]. The MLNQ vows to "fight until the end for Quebec independence", "intends to favour a revolutionary struggle to free the people", "intends to favour the emergence of a people's militia", and overall intends to pursue independence by "any necessary and inevitable means", according to their manifesto. Most common sightings of MLNQ occur during [[Canada Day]] in [[Quebec City]] during the raising of the Canadian flag.

== Supporters ==
Supporters of the MLNQ included [[Pierre Falardeau]] (deceased 2009).

'''''Old Turtle''''' is a 1992 book by [[Douglas Wood (naturalist)|Douglas Wood]] about [[Creation myth|Creation]] and the [[God|nature of God]].

==Reception==
''[[School Library Journal]]'', in a review of ''Old Turtle'', wrote "Environmentally conscious, gender-balanced (references to God include ``She''), and spiritual in mood, this is a New Age fable; its message of saving the Earth is told in lyrical prose and in pictures that delight the eye."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://kcls.bibliocommons.com/item/show/1405963082_old_turtle |title=Old Turtle |website=kcls.bibliocommons.com |accessdate=January 25, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; and ''[[Kirkus Reviews]]'' called it "A handsome, thought-provoking book, especially appropriate for collections that support religious instruction."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.kirkusreviews.com/book-reviews/douglas-wood/old-turtle/ |title=Old Turtle |date=December 1, 1991 |website=Kirkus Reviews |publisher=Kirkus Media LLC |accessdate=January 25, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''[[Publishers Weekly]]'' called it "an enchanting book.", but found "Difficult ideas, painterly art and sophisticated language make this a book primarily for adults."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.publishersweekly.com/978-0-938586-48-7|title=Old Turtle |date=March 2, 1998 |website=Publishers Weekly |publisher=PWxyz LLC|accessdate=January 25, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9385">'''Philipp Andreas Nemnich''' (1764–1822) was a German encyclopaedist, lexicographer and travel writer

==Biographical summary==
Nemnich was born at [[Dillenburg]] in [[Nassau (state)|Nassau]], [[Germany]] on 3 January 1764. He became a [[Licentiate (degree)|Licentiate]] in Law (I.U.L. or J.U.L. = Juris Utriusque Licentiatus) at the [[University of Giessen]] in 1786 and shortly afterwards took up residence in [[Hamburg]] where he remained for the rest of his life. He was a prolific writer in the contemporary press, but is best remembered for a number of [[encyclopedic dictionary|encyclopaedic dictionaries]] and travel reports which he wrote and published over the following thirty years.

The first of these was his ''Allgemeines Polyglotten-Lexicon der Natur-Geschichte'' (''Universal polyglot dictionary of natural history''). It takes the form of a list of German terms in all branches of [[natural history]] with their corresponding terms in eight other European languages. It was published in parts, comprising in all about 2,400 pages, between 1793 and 1798. With the exception of the first part, all were published by Nemnich himself, a practice that he was frequently to adopt with subsequent publications. This was followed by a commercial dictionary in twelve languages, the ''Waaren-lexicon'' (''Dictionary of wares'') of 1797-1802. In parallel with the German edition an English version (for which subscriptions were solicited in the press in 1796&lt;ref&gt;''Sun'' 8.6.1796; ''Morning Post'' 30.6.1796&lt;/ref&gt;) was also prepared for the British market and published in December 1798.

In 1799 Nemnich undertook the first of his two visits to [[United Kingdom|Britain]] during both of which he was particularly concerned with its trade and industries. His original object had been to collect material for a series of articles in the ''[[Allgemeine Zeitung]]'', the newspaper that had been started the previous year by the [[Tübingen]] printer and publisher, [[Johann Friedrich Cotta]]. As it turned out, however, his visit provided him with enough material for a book of over 500 pages. It was published by Cotta in 1800 as '' Beschreibung einer im Sommer 1799 von Hamburg nach u. durch England geschehenen Reise'' (''Description of a journey made in the summer of 1799 from Hamburg to and through England'').

Two further polyglot dictionaries followed, the ''Lexicon nosologicum polyglotton omnium morborum … '', a medical dictionary in ten languages, published by Nemnich himself in 1801, and the ''Comtoir-Lexicon in Neun Sprachen'' of 1803. Again, an English version of the latter was prepared; it was printed in Hamburg and published in 1803 as ''Counting house lexicon in nine languages''.

Nemnich paid a second visit to Britain in 1805-06. He was better prepared this time with 1,200 letters of introduction and had publicly invited the submission of questions on matters which could usefully be investigated. This visit resulted in his ''Neueste Reise durch England, Schottland, und Ireland, hauptsächlich in Bezug auf Produkte, Fabriken, und Handlung'' (''Recent journeys through England, Scotland and Ireland, especially in connection with products, works and commerce''). Despite the title of the book, Nemnich also took in Wales where he was obviously fascinated by the [[Welsh language]]. Like the earlier account of his British travels, this too was published by Cotta in 1807.

In 1808 he made the first of several similar journeys during the course of which he investigated the industries of the Netherlands, France, Italy and Switzerland. His findings appeared in a series of eight volumes as ''Tagebuch einer der Kultur und Industrie gewidmeten Reise'' (''Diary of a journey devoted to culture and industry'') with publication by Cotta spread over the years 1809-11.

Nemnich continued to produce several more dictionaries including his ''Britische Waaren-Encyklopädie'' which also appeared in an English version as ''Encyclopaedia of merchandise: comprising all the exports and imports of Great-Britain, her colonies and America'', both published by Nemnich himself in Hamburg in 1815. This was followed by a German-English/English-German dictionary of commercial correspondence, ''Universal-Lexicon der Englischen und Deutschen Handlungs-Correspondenz'', which also appeared in both German and English versions and was published in 1816. In 1820 a new edition of his ''Waaren-Lexicon'' appeared, the ''Neues Waaren-Lexicon in zwölf Sprachen''.

In 1819 Nemnich was appointed to a post in Hamburg as [[censorship|censor]] of literature intended for children and women and this seems to have brought an end to his prolific writing career. He is known to have produced only one further work which was a translation published in 1820 of [[John Ross (Arctic explorer)|Sir John Ross's]] ''Voyage of discovery ... in H.M.S. Isabella and Alexander, for the purpose of exploring Baffin's Bay and inquiring into the probability of a north-west passage'' (originally published, London, 1819).&lt;ref&gt;And not the translation of an account of a Russian voyage to the polar regions, as stated in the entry in ''Allgemeine Deutsche Biographie'' cited below.&lt;/ref&gt; He died in Hamburg in 1822.

Nemnich was a compulsive observer and collector of facts but he lacked depth and originality and the ability to analyse his facts. His visits to Britain and other European countries reveal him in this light rather than as an industrial spy or as a political economist. He was obviously a natural linguist, a gift which he put to good use in his various polyglot dictionaries.&lt;ref&gt;The above account of Nemnich's life is derived largely from a brief article by F. Ratzel in ''[[Allgemeine Deutsche Biographie]]'' {{cite web|url=http://de.wikisource.org/wiki/ADB:Nemnich,_Philipp_Andreas|year=1886 |title = Nemnich, Philipp Andreas|work= Allgemeine Deutsche Biographie, Bd 23, pp 426-7 |publisher=Historische Commission bei der königl.

The '''Qalb Loze massacre''' was a reported massacre of [[Syrian Druze]] on 10 June 2015 in the village of [[Qalb Loze]] in Syria's northwestern Idlib Governorate. The village was under the control of a coalition of Islamist rebels, when a [[Tunisia]]n commander of one group in the coalition, the [[al-Nusra Front]], tried to confiscate the house of one of the villagers who they accused of working for the Syrian government. The villagers protested and there were two different accounts of what followed. According to anti-government activists, the Nusra fighters opened fire on the protesting villagers,&lt;ref name=NYT&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2015/06/12/world/middleeast/nusra-front-druse-syria-attack.html |title= Syrian Druse Reconsider Alliances After Deadly Attack |last=Barnard |first=Anne|publisher=NYT|accessdate=12 June 2015|date=11 June 2015 |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt; after the Tunisian commander accused them of blasphemy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/wires/afp/article-3123003/Al-Qaeda-Syria-branch-tries-reassure-Druze-shoot-out.html|title=Al-Qaeda Syria branch tries to reassure Druze after shoot-out|work=Mail Online|accessdate=27 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In contrast, Nusra member Mohammad Feezo claimed it was the villagers who opened fire first.&lt;ref name=NYT/&gt; In the end, the al-Nusra Front killed 20 people, including the elderly and a child. The Druze were reported to have killed three members of al-Nusra Front,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.naharnet.com/stories/en/181751-al-nusra-front-kills-20-druze-in-syria Al-Nusra Front Kills 20 Druze in Syria] Abdel Rahman said some of the villagers had weapons and returned fire, killing three members of Al-Nusra in reaction.&lt;/ref&gt; including the Tunisian. Two days later, a report put the number of Druze killed at 24.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.foxnews.com/world/2015/06/12/jihadist-attack-on-syria-druze-population-could-spur-israel-to-act/|title=Jihadist attack on Syria's Druze population could spur Israel to act|author=Paul Alster|work=Fox News|accessdate=27 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The massacre sparked widespread condemnation in neighbouring Lebanon, which has a considerable [[Druze in Lebanon|Druze]] minority. [[Walid Jumblatt]] responded that "Any inciting rhetoric will not be beneficial, and you should remember that Bashar Assad’s policies pushed Syria into this chaos".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.dailystar.com.lb/News/Lebanon-News/2015/Jun-12/301735-killings-of-syrian-druze-draws-wide-condemnation.ashx|title=Killings of Syrian Druze draws wide condemnation|work=The Daily Star Newspaper - Lebanon|accessdate=27 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In contrast, the [[Lebanese Druze]] party chief and former government minister [[Wiam Wahhab]] urged the Druze to form an armed force to defend their community in an angry televised speech saying “We will not accept to sell Druze blood!“. His call was much in line with that of the Syrian Druze spiritual leader who directed the Druze to join the [[Syrian Army]].&lt;ref name="peril"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ibtimes.com/who-are-druze-minority-sect-peril-after-syrian-al-qaeda-branch-slaughters-villagers-1963618|title=Who Are The Druze?

A '''ship prefix''' is a combination of letters, usually abbreviations, used in front of the name of a civilian or naval [[ship]].

==Usage==
Prefixes for civilian vessels may either identify the type of propulsion, such as "PS" for [[paddle steamer]], or purpose, such as "RV" for [[research vessel]]. Civilian prefixes are often used inconsistently, and frequently not at all. Sometimes a slash is used to separate the letters, as in "M/S".

Naval prefixes came into use as abbreviations for longer titles, such as "His/Her Majesty's Ship" in the British [[Royal Navy]], abbreviated "H.M.S." and then "HMS". Earlier uses often included the type of vessel, as for instance "U.S.F." ("United States Frigate") for [[frigate]]s of the [[United States Navy]], that were eliminated by President [[Theodore Roosevelt]]'s Executive order #549 of 1907 making "United States Ship" (USS) the standard for the Navy's commissioned ships while in commission.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Executive_Order_549|title=Executive Order 549|last=Roosevelt|first=Theodore|date=January 8, 1907|publisher=President of the United States|year=|isbn=|location=Washington, DC|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|Naval History And Heritage Command}} In the United States Navy that prefix officially only applies while the ship is in active commission, with only the name used before or after a period of commission and for all vessels "in service" rather than commissioned status.{{sfn|Naval History And Heritage Command}}&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.history.navy.mil/browse-by-topic/heritage/customs-and-traditions/ship-naming.html|title=Ship Naming|last=|first=|date=|website=Naval History and Heritage Command|language=en-US|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-11-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; Today the common practice is to use a single prefix for all [[warship]]s of a nation's navy, and other prefixes for auxiliaries and ships of allied services, such as [[coast guard]]s.

The use of ship prefixes is not universal; in particular neither the German ''[[Kriegsmarine]]'' nor the [[Imperial Japanese Navy]] used ship prefixes, though the suffix ''[[Japanese ship-naming conventions|Maru]]'' meaning "circle" is common for most Japanese civilian vessels. Some English-language writers use prefixes like "DKM" (for "''Deutsche Kriegsmarine''") and "HIJMS" (for "His Imperial Japanese Majesty's Ship") or "IJN" (for "Imperial Japanese Navy", a translation of 大日本帝国海軍 ''dai-nippon teikoku kaigun'') for consistency with "HMS" and "USS". Other writers follow the practice of the navy and omit any prefix.{{Citation needed|reason=Not considered general knowledge; many countries do have prefixes|date=January 2016}}

From the 20th&amp;nbsp;century onwards, most navies identify ships by [[hull number]]s (pennant numbers)—identification codes typically painted on the side of the ship. Each navy has its own system: the United States Navy uses [[hull classification symbol]]s, and the Royal Navy and other navies of Europe and the Commonwealth use [[pennant number]]s.

These tables list both current and historical prefixes known to have been used.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=9_7ycOuv6a4C&amp;pg=PA55&amp;dq=maritime+acronyms+and+abbreviations&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwishM_g9rreAhVFiOAKHeXPAT4Q6AEIKjAA#v=onepage&amp;q=maritime%20acronyms%20and%20abbreviations&amp;f=false|title=Dictionary of Nautical Acronyms and Abbreviations|last=Launer|first=Donald|date=2006|publisher=Sheridan House, Inc.|isbn=9781574092394|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Prefix conventions ===
The designations for United Kingdom ships applied at the time of the [[British Empire]], before the establishment of separate navies for the Dominions.

In the [[Royal Netherlands Navy]], "[[HNLMS]]" is the prefix in English, a translation of the Dutch original "Hr.Ms." or "Zr.Ms.".  "Hr.Ms." should preferably not be used in English-language documents; nevertheless it is often seen on the [[World Wide Web]]. Until the moment a Dutch naval ship officially enters active service in the fleet, the ship's name is used without the prefix.&lt;ref&gt;Circulaire Zeemacht 1569cc (1988).&lt;/ref&gt; Since [[Willem-Alexander of the Netherlands|King Willem-Alexander]] succeeded [[Beatrix of the Netherlands|Queen Beatrix]] on 30 April 2013, "Hr.Ms." is replaced by "Zr.Ms.".

In Australia, the prefix NUSHIP is used to denote ships that have yet to be commissioned into the fleet.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title= What are Ship Prefixes for Naval and Merchant Vessels?
|last = Dasgupta
|first = Soumyajit
|url =http://www.marineinsight.com/marine/marine-news/headline/what-are-ship-prefixes-for-naval-and-merchant-vessels/
|accessdate=25 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the United States, all prefixes other than "USS", "USNS", "USNV", and "USRC" were made obsolete in 1901, when President [[Theodore Roosevelt]] issued an Executive order fixing American naval nomenclature.{{sfn|Naval History And Heritage Command}} USRC was replaced by USCGC when the [[Revenue Cutter Service]] merged with the [[United States Lifesaving Service]] to become the [[United States Coast Guard]] in 1915.{{sfn|United States Coast Guard Historian's Office}} USLHT also was replaced by USCGC when the [[United States Lighthouse Service]] became a part of the U.S. Coast Guard in 1939. USC&amp;GS was replaced by NOAAS when the [[United States Coast and Geodetic Survey]] merged with other U.S. Government scientific agencies to form the [[National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration]] in 1970.

A United States Navy ship that is not in active commission does not hold the title of United States Ship with simply the name without prefix used before and after commissioned service.{{sfn|Naval History And Heritage Command}} Vessels, such as yard and harbor craft that are not commissioned and "in service" are officially referred to by name or hull number without prefix.{{sfn|Naval History And Heritage Command}} Military Sealift Command (MSC) civilian manned ships "in service" are given the prefix United States Naval Ship (USNS).{{sfn|Naval History And Heritage Command}} 
Prior to commissioning, ships may be described as a [[pre-commissioning unit]] or PCU; for example, the uncommissioned {{USS|Gerald R. Ford|CVN-78|3}} has been described as the "pre-commissioning unit (PCU) ''Gerald R. Ford''."&lt;ref name="NNS PCU CVN-78"&gt;{{cite press release |url=http://www.navy.mil/submit/display.asp?story_id=74667 |agency=Navy News Service |title=PCU Gerald R. Ford (CVN 78) Welcomes 60 New Crew Members |id=NNS130606-12 |date=6 June 2013 |accessdate=24 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the vessel's official name is ''Gerald R. Ford'' without any prefix, and will be known as USS ''Gerald R. Ford'' once commissioned.{{sfn|Naval History And Heritage Command}}&lt;!----"PCU" is not part of the vessel's name and is not a prefix.----&gt;

When it is stricken from the fleet list, a ship typically has the prefix "ex-" added to its name, to distinguish it from any active ships bearing the same name. For example, after [[USS Constellation (CV-64)|USS ''Constellation'']] (CV-64) was retired in 2003, she became referred to as ex-''Constellation''.

Note that while calling a US ship "the USS ''Flattop''" may make grammatical sense, the preliminary article "the" is discouraged by nearly all style guides, and the U.S. Navy. The U.S. Navy uses ship names without article, except for [[USS The Sullivans (DDG-68)|USS ''The Sullivans'']], named for the five [[Sullivan brothers]], all lost at sea during [[World War II]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.the-sullivans.navy.mil/&lt;/ref&gt; Its British equivalent ("the HMS ''Flattop''") is also discouraged, since "the Her Majesty's Ship" would be grammatically incorrect.

Yugoslavia war navy had strict naming rules and ships prefix that was driven by order by President of Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia in 1969. After dissolution of Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia new state Federal Republic of Yugoslavia continued same naming convention for War navy of Yugoslavia Armed Forces from 1992 to 2003.

== In science fiction ==
Fictional equivalents of tri-letter prefixes frequently appear in English-language science fiction works, applied to seafaring and spaceborne ships alike. See also [[Space navy]] for similar adoption of naval customs for fictional spacefaring military organizations.
* ''[[Star Trek]]'' – the United Federation of Planets uses the prefix "USS" for [[List of Starfleet starships ordered by class|its starships]]. While [[Gene Roddenberry]] never defined what the abbreviation stood for, some speculate that it means "United Space Ship", "United Star Ship", or "United [''Federation of Planets''] Starfleet Starship/Ship". In the alternate "[[Mirror Universe]]", the Terran Empire use an "ISS" prefix instead. Other races use different prefixes for their ships:
** [[Klingon]]s use IKS (Imperial Klingon Ship) or IKC (Imperial Klingon Cruiser).
** [[Romulan]] vessels typically receive the prefix IRW (Imperial Romulan Warbird), or RIS where some speculate that it means "Romulan Imperial Ship", and ChR. (ChR is from novelist Diane Duane's imagining of the Star Trek Universe, in which the Romulans refer to their home planet as "Ch'Rihan". Though Duane's version has a loyal following among many fans, it is not considered official Star Trek canon; similarly, the [[Ferengi]] designation of FMS, and the [[Cardassian]] CDS, are also not canon.)
* ''[[Babylon 5]]'' – The [[Earth Alliance (Babylon 5)|Earth Alliance]] uses the prefix "EAS" for "Earth Alliance Ship". Some fan material also uses it for "Earth Alliance Station".
* ''[[Elite: Dangerous]]'' – The Federation uses the prefix "FNS" (Federal Naval Ship) for some military ships. The Empire uses "INV" (Imperial Naval Vessel).
* ''[[Firefly (TV series)|Firefly]]'' – Vessels in the [[Union of Allied Planets]] fleet are given the prefix "IAV", for Interstellar Alliance Vessel.
* The [[Terran Confederation (Wing Commander)|Terran Confederation]], from ''[[Wing Commander (franchise)|Wing Commander]]'', uses TCS (Terran Confederation Ship) for its vessels.
* ''[[Halo (series)|Halo]]'' – [[United Nations Space Command]] spacecraft use the prefix "UNSC". The Covenant use three letter designations for ship class such as CAS or CSO
* ''[[Mass Effect (series)|Mass Effect]]'' – features several prefixes, primarily "SSV" for "Systems Alliance space vehicle"&lt;ref&gt;In-Game Codex, entry for SSV ''Normandy''.&lt;/ref&gt; and "MSV" for "Merchant Space Vehicle", used on numerous human commercial ships, as well as "PFS" for a Turian Hierarchy naval craft, and a freighter AML ''Demeter'' of unknown affiliation.
* ''[[Dead Space (series)|Dead Space]]'' – "USG", standing for "United Spacefaring Guild", which oversees civilian spacecraft operation, including the planet-cracker class leader USG ''Ishimura'' of the Concordance Extraction Corporation; "USM" for the Earth Defense Force of EarthGov; and "CMS" for its former opponents, the Sovereign Colonies Armed Forces.
* ''[[StarCraft: Brood War]]'' – The United Earth Directorate uses DSS (presumably for Directorate Space Ship, e. g. ''DSS Aleksander''); the Terran Confederacy used CSF (Confederate Space Fleet, e. g. ''CSF Ragnorak'') for their battlecruisers.
* ''[[Killzone (series)|Killzone]]'' – The Interplanetary Strategic Alliance (ISA) uses "ISC", for Interplanetary Strategic Cruiser.
* ''[[The Moon is a Harsh Mistress]]'' – The Federated Nations use "FNS", presumably meaning "Federated Nations Ship".
* ''[[Alien (franchise)|Alien]]'' – The ships use prefix "USCSS" for "United States Cargo SpaceShip" on the Nostromo, Prometheus, and Covenant.
* ''[[The Lost Fleet]]'' – The Alliance use the prefix "ASN" for "Allied Systems Navy" (or possibly "Alliance of Systems Navy"), the Syndicate Worlds do not use prefixes.
* ''[[CoDominium]]'' – CoDominium vessels use the prefix "CDS" for CoDominium Ship.
* "[[Honorverse]]" – The Manticoran kingdom uses "HMS" as a prefix, the Graysons use GNS, and the Havenite ships use "PNS" being reflections of actual ship prefixing traditions, and mirroring the Napoleonic wars.
* ''[[The Culture]]'' – Ships are identified by a three-letter prefix denoting class (such as GSV for "General Systems Vehicle" or ROU for "Rapid Offensive Unit"), followed by their personal name.
* ''[[The Expanse (novel series)|The Expanse]]'' – Ships of the United Nations Navy use the prefix "UNN," while ships of the Martian Congressional Republic Navy are prefixed with "MCRN". The Nauvoo, a [[generation ship]] commissioned by the [[Church of Latter Day Saints]] was prefixed with "LDSS" for "Latter Day Saints' Ship", and later changed to "OPAS" and re-christened as the "OPAS Behemoth" representing the Outer Planets Alliance.
* ''[[Unreal Tournament]]'' – Ships mentioned there have prefixes such as ITV ("Interstellar Transport Vessel", the first non-tutorial match in the tournament happens on board of ''ITV Oblivion'') and ISV ("Interstellar Science Vessel", ship's name being ''ISV-Kran'' from ''[[Unreal (1998 video game)|Unreal]]'').
* ''[[Return to Na Pali|Unreal: Return to Na Pali]]'' – ISV (''ISV-Kran'') and UMS ("Unified Military Services", a prefix for warships).

The '''Soviet sale of Hermitage paintings''' in 1930 and 1931 resulted in the departure of some of the most valuable paintings from the collection of the [[State Hermitage Museum]] in [[Leningrad]] to Western museums. Several of the paintings had been in the Hermitage Collection since its creation by Empress [[Catherine the Great]]. About 250 paintings were sold, including masterpieces by [[Jan van Eyck]], [[Titian]], [[Rembrandt]], [[Rubens]], [[Raphael]], and other important artists.  [[Andrew Mellon]] donated the [[List of original Hermitage paintings in the National Gallery of Art|twenty-one paintings]] he purchased from the Hermitage to the United States government in 1937, which became the nucleus of the [[National Gallery of Art]] in [[Washington, D.C.]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Russian will review art sales|url=http://articles.latimes.com/2008/dec/09/entertainment/et-quick9.S5|website=LA Times|accessdate=8 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
{{Refimprove| section|date=February 2016}} 
In the late 1920s, the Soviet government urgently needed foreign currency to finance the rapid industrialization of Russia ordered in the first [[Five-Year Plans for the National Economy of the Soviet Union|Five Year Plan]].  The government had already sold off collections of jewelry, furniture and icons seized from the Russian nobility, wealthy classes, and the church.

[[File:Antoine Watteau 063.jpg|thumb|''The Lute Player'' by [[Antoine Watteau]], was purchased for the Hermitage by [[Catherine the Great]] in 1767. It was sold in May 1930 to [[Calouste Gulbenkian]], who sold it in 1934 to the [[Metropolitan Museum]] in New York.]]

In February 1928, the [[State Hermitage Museum]] in [[Leningrad]], along with the [[Russian Museum]], was ordered to make a list of art works worth at least two million rubles, for export. A special agency called 'Antiquariat' was created under the ''[[Narkompros]]''  (the People's Commisariat of Enlightenment) and opened an office in Leningrad to oversee the sale.  The Hermitage was instructed to sell 250 paintings for at least 5000 rubles each, plus engravings and a number of golden treasures from ancient [[Scythia]].

The sale was secret, but word was quietly spread to selected western art dealers and collectors that the paintings were on the market.

The first foreign buyer to purchase Hermitage paintings was [[Calouste Gulbenkian]], the founder of the Iraq Petroleum Company, who began buying paintings in early 1930, trading them for oil with the Russians. These works later formed part of the [[Calouste Gulbenkian Museum]], in [[Lisbon]]. However, the organizers of the sale were dissatisfied with the amounts they received from Gulbenkian, so they looked for other buyers.
[[File:Raphael - Saint George and the Dragon - Google Art Project.jpg|right|thumb|''[[St. George and the Dragon (Raphael)|Saint George and the Dragon]]'', by Raphael, was purchased for the Hermitage by [[Catherine the Great]] in 1772, and later hung in the gallery of portraits of the generals who had defeated Napoleon. It was sold to Andrew Mellon in 1931.]]

[[Andrew Mellon]] was an American banker, Secretary of the Treasury for Presidents [[Warren G. Harding]], [[Calvin Coolidge]] and [[Herbert Hoover]], art collector and, at the time, American Ambassador to Great Britain.  He conceived the idea of founding a National Gallery for the United States modeled after the [[National Gallery (London)]].  He heard about the secret Hermitage sale from [[Knoedler]] and Company of New York, dealers which he regularly used for his art purchases.

Franz Zatzenstein-Matthiesen, a young German art dealer, had been asked by the [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] Government to compile a list of the hundred paintings in Russian collections, which should never be sold under any circumstances. He was surprised soon afterwards to find several of the paintings on his list were in Paris, purchased by Gulbenkian.   Gulbenkian asked him to act as his agent on further purchases, but Matthiesen instead formed a consortium with [[Colnaghi's]] of London and with Mellon's firm, [[Knoedler]].   In 1930 and 1931 the consortium bought twenty-one paintings from the Soviet government, which they offered to Mellon, who had the right of first refusal.&lt;ref&gt;Walker, 1964, pp 24-6&lt;/ref&gt; By the end of 1931, Mellon had acquired twenty-one paintings for a total price of $6,654,000. They included [[Annunciation (van Eyck, Washington)|Van Eyck's ''Annunciation'']] and Raphael's ''[[The Alba Madonna]]''.  The latter painting was sold for $1,166,400, the largest sum ever paid for a single painting until that time.  The consortum sold several other paintings to other clients, including the [[Metropolitan Museum of Art]] in New York.

The sale remained secret until November 4, 1933, when it was reported in the ''New York Times'' that several Hermitage paintings, including the ''[[Crucifixion and Last Judgement diptych]]'' by van Eyck, had been purchased by the [[Metropolitan Museum]]..

The sales came to an end in 1934, possibly as a result of a letter to Stalin from the deputy director of the Hermitage, [[Joseph Orbeli]], protesting the sale of Russia's treasures.  The director of the Hermitage, [[Boris Legran]], who had been brought to the museum to conduct the sale, was dismissed in 1934 and replaced by Orbeli.

In 1937, Andrew Mellon donated the twenty-one paintings, along with the money to build a National Gallery of Art to house them, to the United States Government. The paintings were, and remain, the heart of the National Gallery collection.

Other sales were made in the same period, notably the [[Codex Siniaticus]] from the [[Russian National Library]], sold in 1933 to the [[British Museum]] (after 1973 [[British Library]]) for £100,000 raised by public subscription (worth £{{Formatprice|{{Inflation|UK|100000|1933|r=-5}}}} in {{CURRENTYEAR}}),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Metzger |first = Bruce M.|author2=Ehrman, Bart D.  | title = The Text of the New Testament: Its Transmission, Corruption, and Restoration | edition = 4th | publisher = Oxford University Press | place = New York – Oxford | year = 2005 | pages = 64 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and ''[[The Night Café]]'' by [[Vincent van Gogh]].

In the 1990s, following the [[collapse of the Soviet Union]], the Parliament of the [[Russian Federation]] passed a new law prohibiting the sale of Russian art treasures to foreign countries.

For many years the National Gallery was reluctant to lend the paintings it had bought from the Hermitage back to that Museum, for fear that the Russian government would keep the paintings in Russia. That policy changed after 1990, when [[Mikhail Piotrovsky]] became director of the Hermitage. A number of the National Gallery paintings have been on loan to the Hermitage, including ''Venus with a Mirror'' by [[Titian]], which was lent to the Hermitage at the time of the first visit of the President [[George W. Bush]] to [[St Petersburg]] in 2002.

'''''The Highway Code''''' is the official [[road user guide]] for [[Malta]].

== Background ==
The Highway Code is published by the [[Government of Malta|Maltese government]] and is their official road user guide. The guide contains road use rules for pedestrians, cyclists and automobile users. The manual is available in both English and [[Maltese language|Maltese]] and as a printed publication and online.&lt;ref&gt;[https://gov.mt/en/Life%20Events/Owning%20a%20Vehicle/Pages/Land-Transport.aspx] Department of Information Malta&lt;/ref&gt;

== Influence on road safety ==
A motoring commentator for the Maltese ''[[The Times (Malta)|The Sunday Times]]'' argued that roads might be safer in Malta if a higher priority is given to enforcing the rules in ''The Highway Code'' and that higher penalties for contravention should be dispensed.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.timesofmalta.com/articles/view/20121118/motoring/Don-t-be-an-idiot.445896] Times of Malta&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5594">"'''The Mouse Problem'''" is a [[Monty Python]] [[sketch comedy|sketch]], first aired in 1969 as part of ''[[List of Monty Python's Flying Circus episodes#2. Sex and Violence|Sex and Violence]]'', the second episode of the first season of ''[[Monty Python's Flying Circus]]''.

==Overview==
In the sketch, an interviewer ([[Terry Jones]]) and linkman ([[Michael Palin]]) for a fictional programme called ''The World Around Us'', investigate the phenomenon of "men [who] want to be [[mice]]". The programme bears a striking similarity to an episode of ''[[Panorama (TV series)|Panorama]]'';&lt;ref name="Shaxper"&gt;{{Cite book |title=Monty Python, Shakespeare, and English Renaissance Drama |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=3Z6yKtyT-cYC&amp;pg=PA152 |page=152 |first=Darl |last=Larsen |year=2003 |publisher=McFarland}}&lt;/ref&gt; even its theme tune, the fourth movement of [[Symphony No. 1 (Rachmaninoff)|Rachmaninoff's Symphony No. 1]], was the theme tune of ''Panorama'' at the time.

A "confessor" ([[John Cleese]]) is interviewed about his experience as a mouse: when he was a teenager, he got drunk at a party and experimented with cheese, and gradually came to accept his mouse identity.  "It's not a question of wanting to be a mouse — it just sort of happens to you," he tells the interviewer.  "All of a sudden you realize… that's what you want to be."&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | title = The Complete Monty Python's Flying Circus: All the Words, vol. 1|author1=Graham Chapman |author2=John Cleese |author3=Terry Gilliam |author4=Eric Idle |author5=Terry Jones |author6=Michael Palin |page=25|date=1989| publisher = Pantheon |isbn=0-679-72647-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; The "programme" features undercover footage of a "mouse party", where Cleese explains that "[[Hickory Dickory Dock|there's a big clock in the middle of the room, and about 12:50 you climb up it and then... eventually, it strikes one and you all run down]]". He also points out that there's "[[Three Blind Mice|a farmer's wife]]" present. Then follows a discussion with psychiatrist and conjuror, The Amazing Kargol ([[Graham Chapman]]), about what attracts men to the mouse lifestyle. A series of [[vox pop]]s illustrates societal attitudes towards mice men, and several historical figures who were mice, such as [[Julius Caesar]] and [[Napoleon]] are shown, "and, of course [[Hilaire Belloc]]," is included. The programme also includes footage of men in mouse costumes being led into police stations, newspaper headlines about mouse scandals and mouse rights demonstrations, and photos of "mouse clubs".

In the original version of the sketch broadcast in 1969, Cleese gave out the telephone number of the mouse man as "01-584 5313". The number was that of [[David Frost]]'s production company, which led to a large number of annoying telephone calls to Frost.&lt;ref&gt;David Frost, ''An Autobiography'', HarperCollins, 1993, p. 505&lt;/ref&gt; The sketch was re-edited for the repeat showing in August 1970 to remove this section.&lt;ref&gt;Andrew Pixley, ''TV Zone'' issue 146, 2001, cited in '[http://www.sotcaa.net/history/ukonline/python_frame.html?/history/ukonline/python/python_tv_01.html Monty Python edit news], accessed 9 March 2011&lt;/ref&gt;{{Dead link|date=March 2018}}

The deviant way of life explored in "The Mouse Problem" is an obvious parody of the secretive lives and social condemnation of [[homosexuality|gay men]] in the 1960s, and the sketch itself mimics the film and interview techniques used in serious television documentary exposés on the subject,&lt;ref name="Shaxper"/&gt;&lt;ref name="enc"&gt;{{Cite book |title= The Queer Encyclopedia of Film &amp; Television |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=yrgUAQAAIAAJ |publisher=Cleis Press |year=2005 |first=Claude J. |last=Summers |page=68}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |title= A Grand Guy: The Art and Life of Terry Southern |first=Lee |last=Hill |year=2001 |publisher=HarperCollins |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=PzJtFBXwBsEC&amp;pg=PT238}}&lt;/ref&gt; but also makes reference to [[transvestism]], [[recreational drug use]], [[orgies]] and other behaviour considered "deviant" by the standards of the late 1960s.&lt;ref name="Larsen2008"&gt;{{cite book|author=Darl Larsen|title=Monty Python's Flying Circus: An Utterly Complete, Thoroughly Unillustrated, Absolutely Unauthorized Guide to Possibly All the References|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Ud9h3kdxQNQC&amp;pg=PA34|date=13 June 2008|publisher=Scarecrow Press|isbn=978-1-4616-6970-8|page=34}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Eric Zorn]] of the ''[[Chicago Tribune]]'' notes its similarity to a real 1967 documentary, ''[[CBS Reports: The Homosexuals]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url= http://blogs.chicagotribune.com/news_columnists_ezorn/2010/02/the-homosexuals-a-cbs-report.html |work=Change of Subject |publisher=Chicago Tribune |last=Zorn |first=Eric |title='The Homosexuals' — a CBS report |date=February 14, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Chapman himself, who wrote the sketch, was gay.&lt;ref name="enc"/&gt;

More recently, with a somewhat more literal interpretation, the sketch has come to be seen as a presage of the [[furry fandom]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |title=Carnal Knowledge: Baxter's Concise Encyclopedia of Modern Sex |first=John |last=Baxter | page =124 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=7qEG7CBOH_gC&amp;pg=PA124 |year=2009 |publisher=HarperCollins}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4046">This two-sided, red figure belly [[amphora]] is housed in the Classics wing of the [[Museum of Fine Arts, Boston]].  It was bought during [[Art Basel]] from Münzen und Medaillen, A.G., October 17, 1963.&lt;ref&gt;Crane&lt;/ref&gt; With flat handles decorated with depictions of ivy, and a double layered foot, it qualifies as a type A amphora.  Dated circa 510 BCE, it was likely created by a member of the circle of [[Euthymides]] in Athens.&lt;ref&gt;Crane&lt;/ref&gt;  It is an early example of [[red-figure pottery]] which had been invented only ten years previously. It is regarded by scholars as one of the best examples of the vases that influenced [[Etruscan art|artists in Etruria]].&lt;ref&gt;Vermeule, 153&lt;/ref&gt;  It is in excellent condition, but lacks an original find-spot. 

==Depictions==

This vase consists of two scenes on either side of the vase, separated by a floral border.

Side A shows the tussle between [[Apollo]] and [[Herakles]] over the [[Sacrificial tripod|Delphic Tripod]], a common subject in painted vases.  These bronze tripods were used for sacrifices, and were a very common [[votive offering]] at Archaic [[Greek temple]]s; large numbers have been found at Apollo’s important cult site of [[Delphi]], where this legend is set.  Herakles is attempting to steal the particular sacred tripod of Delphi after the [[Pythia|Pythian oracle]] refused to tell Herakles how to cure himself of a disease.  Apollo attempts to stop Herakles and an argument between the two half-brothers devolves into a [[Greek wrestling|wrestling]] contest.  This fight is eventually broken up when the two are separated by one of [[Zeus]]’ lightning bolts.  

Side A depicts the moment when Apollo first grabs Herakles’ bicep to stop him from absconding with the tripod.  With an open mouth, he seems to beseech Herakles to reconsider his actions.  Herakles wrenches his arm from Apollo, shifting his weight from one foot to the other.  The sacred palm in the middle of the frame serves as a barrier between the two figures and as a marker of the sacred site of Delphi.  The words HERAKLEOS, KALOS, and APOLLONOS which mean Herakles, Beautiful, and Apollo respectively.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mfa.org/collections/object/two-handled-jar-amphora-153621 Boston MFA page]&lt;/ref&gt;

Professor Warren G. Moon has noted that the depiction of Herakles silhouette and movement bear similarities to depictions by the [[Rycroft Painter]] on [[black-figure pottery]] work.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Warren G. Moon |editor=[[The J. Paul Getty Museum]] |authorlink= |title=Greek Vases in the J. Paul Getty Museum |volume=2 |chapter=Some New and Little-Known Vases by the Rycroft and Priam Painters |year=1985 |publisher=Getty Publications |location= |pages=62 |quote= | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Gd81AgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA62&amp;lpg=PA62 |isbn=0-89236-070-4 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Side B shows a common motif among Archaic pottery - a scuffle between a [[maenad]] and a group of [[satyr]]s.  The [[ithyphallic]] satyrs defend themselves from the blows of the maenad’s grape vines as they advance upon her.&lt;ref&gt;Crane&lt;/ref&gt;  This composition of this side, with three figures evenly spaced, with varied and expressive poses, is a type adapted by  Etruscan artists in their tomb paintings, as well as vases made in Etruria.&lt;ref&gt;Vermeule, 153-156&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Verify in field''' is a construction document notation indicating that the [[dimensions]] on a [[Blueprint|drawing]] (including architectural, structural, plumbing, mechanical, and electrical plans or miscellaneous vendor shop drawings) require additional verification on the actual site or field.  This is commonly shown on drawings as "VIF".  Generally the dimensions to be verified will be highlighted by "bubbling" around them or through some other method to indicate that verification is required.

'''Wookieepedia: The ''Star Wars'' Wiki''' is an [[online encyclopedia]] for information on the ''[[Star Wars]]'' [[fictional universe]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://entertainment.timesonline.co.uk/tol/arts_and_entertainment/whats_on/article2258521.ece |title=The arts online |publisher=The Times |accessdate=2008-05-22 |last=Bjortomt |first=Olav |location=London |date=2007-08-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;&amp;mdash;including information on all the films, as well as ''[[Clone Wars (cartoon)|Clone Wars]]'', ''[[Star Wars: The Clone Wars (2008 TV series)|The Clone Wars]]'' and its [[Star Wars: The Clone Wars (film)|introductory film]], ''[[Star Wars Rebels|Rebels]]'', the [[Star Wars expanded universe|''Star Wars'' expanded universe]], and any upcoming ''Star Wars'' material. It is a specialized wiki created to be an extensive encyclopedia of the ''Star Wars'' universe with some articles reaching up to 60,000 words,&lt;ref name="variety" /&gt; and is written almost entirely from an in-universe perspective. The name Wookieepedia is a [[portmanteau]] of [[Wookiee]] and [[encyclopedia]], a pun on the name of ''[[Wikipedia]]''. The logo, too, is a [[visual pun]] showing the incomplete second [[Death Star]] as opposed to Wikipedia's incomplete "[[Wikipedia logo|jigsaw logo]]".

It is a fan-built version of the [[Holocron]], a [[database]] maintained by [[Lucasfilm]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Art of Immersion: How the Digital Generation Is Remaking Hollywood, Madison Avenue, and the Way We Tell Stories|last=Rose|first=Frank|publisher=W. W. Norton &amp; Company|year=2011|isbn=9780393080797|ref=Rose}}&lt;/ref&gt; to track everything in the ''Star Wars'' universe and ensure [[Continuity (fiction)|continuity]] within it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.wired.com/entertainment/hollywood/magazine/16-09/ff_starwarscanon?currentPage=all|title=Meet Leland Chee, the Star Wars Franchise Continuity Cop|last=Baker|first=Chris|publisher=[[Wired (magazine)|Wired]]|date=18 August 2008|accessdate=2013-03-09|ref=Baker}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Wookieepedia was conceived by Steven Greenwood and created at the request of hosting site Wikia by Chad Barbry.&lt;ref name="variety"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://variety.com/2007/digital/news/wookieepedia-tracks-star-wars-1117964316/|title=Wookieepedia tracks ‘Star Wars’|author=Thomas J. McLean|work=Variety}}&lt;/ref&gt; Barbry also conceived the name "Wookiepedia", which was later respelled with an extra 'e'. On March 4, 2005, Wookieepedia was launched at [[Wikia]].

Wookieepedia was the most-visited wiki hosted by Wikia {{As of|2005|April|alt=as of April 2005}}. In 2015, it drew 3.7&amp;nbsp;million monthly visitors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Greenburg|first1=Zack O'Malley|authorlink=Zack O'Malley Greenburg|title=Inside The Star Wars-Stoked Business Of Wikia's Wookieepedia|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/zackomalleygreenburg/2015/04/17/inside-the-star-wars-stoked-business-of-wikias-wookieepedia/|website=Forbes|accessdate=17 September 2017|language=en|date=April 17, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; On November 28, 2005, Wookieepedia was selected as the [[Syfy|Sci Fi Channel]]'s "Sci Fi Site of the Week."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.scifi.com/sfw/issue449/site.html|title=Sci-Fi Site of the Week|publisher=Sci-Fi.com|date=2005-11-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; In January 2006, the site was featured as the Wikia of the Month.

A 2014 [[April Fools' Day]] joke was posted on the site involving [[Extraterrestrial life|alien]] [[breasts]].&lt;ref name="eleven-thirtyeight.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://eleven-thirtyeight.com/2014/04/fear-and-loathing-on-the-wookieepedia/|title=Fear and Loathing on the Wookieepedia|publisher=Eleven-ThirtyEight.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{As of|2018|alt=As of May 2018}}, the [[English language]] version of the wiki contains over 142,&lt;!-- If you update this number, please also update the number in the infobox. Also, per [[MOS:UNCERTAINTY]], round down to a multiple of 1,000. Thank you. --&gt;000 articles,&lt;ref name="Wookiee_statistics"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://starwars.wikia.com/wiki/Special:Statistics |title=Statistics |last= |first= |date= |website=Wookieepedia |publisher=[[Wikia]] |accessdate=December 7, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; making it the sixth-largest&lt;ref name="Wikia statistics"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://community.wikia.com/wiki/Hub:Big_wikis |title=Big wikis |last= |first= |date=December 3, 2014 |website=Wikia Community Central |publisher=[[Wikia]] |accessdate=December 7, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Wikia in terms of article count, ahead of other wikis such as [[Memory Alpha]] and [[WoWWiki]]. Wikia hosts ''Star Wars'' wikis in many other languages, and Wookieepedia also coordinates its efforts with the German language wiki called Jedipedia.net and the Polish language Biblioteka Ossus.

After [[Star Wars expanded universe|''Star Wars'' expanded universe]] was declared non-[[canon (fiction)|canon]]ical to the future works and rebranded as ''Star Wars Legends'' in April 2014, Wookieepedia implemented separate "Canon" and "Legends" tabs for subjects that appeared both before and after the [[Reboot (fiction)|continuity reboot]]. "Legends" tab only includes information from sources released prior to the 2014 reboot, while "Canon" tab contains information from works published from 2015 onwards, including the movies released under [[The Walt Disney Company]]. Both tabs include information from Episodes I-VI and ''[[Star Wars: The Clone Wars (2008 TV series)|The Clone Wars]]'' TV series.

==Reception==
[[Felicity Jones]] used Wookieepedia to have a better understanding of the ''Star Wars'' world and better portray [[Jyn Erso]] in the 2016 film ''[[Rogue One]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Delahunty-Light|first1=Zoe|title=6 things I learnt from the Star Wars: Rogue One home release (Felicity Jones used Wookieepedia A LOT)|url=http://www.gamesradar.com/6-things-i-learned-from-the-star-wars-rogue-one-home-release-felicity-jones-used-wookieepedia-a-lot/|website=gamesradar|accessdate=17 September 2017|language=en|date=March 24, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Fans have criticized the administrators and how the content is circulated. Some have even gone so far as to say it is a rather "alienating" wiki given its appeal being centered on only main ''Star Wars'' fans if nothing more.&lt;ref name="eleven-thirtyeight.com"/&gt;
