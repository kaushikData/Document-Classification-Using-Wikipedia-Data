'''Amagents Football Club''' is a football club based in the Broadhurst district of [[Gaborone]], Botswana. For the 2010/11 Season they will be playing in the GACFA Second Division.

==Organisation==
The club consists of the first team and two youth teams, who play at the Under 17 and Under 15 levels. The first team is coached by Jonathan Laverick, who was appointed in May 2009, the youth teams are managed by William Monene.

==Colours==
Amagents play in Black Shirts/Shorts with Orange trimming. The youth teams play in an all white kit. There are currently no shirt sponsors. The youth teams play in Blue, with the kit being donated by Billingham Campus School in the UK.

==Recent history==
Amagents had an eventful 2008/9 season moving to Lekhubu Private School after their home ground was demolished for development. Although they led the league at Christmas, the team ended up missing out on promotion after a poor second half of the season. This led to the appointment of a new coach. This led to a strong start to the 2009/10 season, but only a sixth-place finish. &lt;br /&gt;The U17 team gained third place in an international 7-a-Side competition held at [[Maru a Pula School]] in September 2009. Following this success a campaign was launched to organise boots and equipment for the youth team. This campaign was featured in the [[Northern Echo]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

The '''Best Record-Breaking Performance ESPY Award''' has been presented since 2001 to the [[amateur sports|amateur]] or [[professional sports|professional]] sportsperson, irrespective of nationality or sport contested, adjudged to have, in a single play, game, or season, completed the best record-breaking (and -setting) performance, irrespective of the nature of the record broken.    

Between 2001 and 2004, the award voting panel comprised variously fans; sportswriters and broadcasters, sports executives, and retired sportspersons, termed collectively ''experts''; and [[List of ESPN personalities|ESPN personalities]], but balloting thereafter has been undertaken exclusively by fans over the Internet from amongst choices nominated by the ESPN Select Nominating Committee.

Through the 2001 iteration of the ESPY Awards, ceremonies were conducted in February of each year to honor achievements over the previous calendar year; awards presented thereafter are conferred in June and reflect performance from the June previous.&lt;ref&gt;Because of the [[ESPY Awards#Timing|rescheduling]] of the ESPY Awards ceremony, the award presented in 2002 was given in consideration of performance betwixt February 2001 and June 2002.&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Canadian Ski Museum''' (French: ''Le Musée canadien du ski'') is a [[museum]] based in [[Mont-Tremblant, Quebec]]. It was founded in 1971 by a dedicated group of volunteers and [[ski]] enthusiasts. Shortly thereafter, in 1975 the museum was incorporated. Since 2011 it has left the [[Ottawa]] location with collection online or stored.

The museum's founders recognized the rapid expansion and development of the sport of [[skiing]] over the years; this inspired them to collect not only the material and artifacts related to skiing, but also the various stories associated with the early years. These artifacts and stories remain to be the foundation from which the museum has built its world-class collection.

Upon the museum's opening, Herman 'Jackrabbit' Smith-Johannsen [http://www.skimuseum.ca/biodata.php?lang=en&amp;id=123] acted as the Patron of the Canadian Ski Museum, and donated several of his prize possessions to the collection.  Within the museum exhibit is an area devoted to 'Jackrabbit', the protagonist and practitioner of cross country and wilderness skiing who lived and breathed skiing for 111 years of his legendary life.

The Canadian Ski Museum's unparalleled collection of artifacts and archival holdings are a priceless part of Canadian [[cultural heritage]].  Since the Museum's beginnings, the collection has continued to grow, and the presentations of displays and stories about the history of skiing in Canada have increased.  The museum has an incredible collection of photographs, memorabilia, skis, poles and ski clothing donated by skiers, all devoted to preserving the memory of Canada's skiing past.

At present, volunteers supported by a small paid staff, carry out the Museum's activities.  The Museum relies on the support of friends and donors to continue to preserve and present Canadian Ski Heritage.

The Canadian Ski Museum established the [[Canadian Ski Hall of Fame]] in 1982 [http://www.skimuseum.ca/famealpha.php?lang=en]. Since the creation of the Canadian Ski Hall of Fame over 140 people have been inducted. The Canadian Ski Hall of Fame honours the pioneers, competitors, builders and industry personnel that have contributed significantly to Canada's skiing/snowboarding heritage.

The Canadian Ski Museum is a registered Canadian Charity and governed by a Board of Directors, operating through the Chair of the Board and an Executive Committee. The Canadian Ski Museum is recognized by the Fédération Internationale de Ski ("FIS") the [[International Ski Federation]].

'''Climbing, or alpine, clubs''' form to promote and preserve the climbing way of life, including [[rock climbing]], [[ice climbing]], [[alpinism]] &amp; [[ski mountaineering]]. 

Clubs frequently act as advocates to protect climbing areas, advocate for climbers around the world, preserve climbing’s history and chronicle climbing achievement.&lt;ref&gt;[http://americanalpineclub.org/ The purpose of the American Alpine Club]&lt;/ref&gt;

Climbing clubs usually schedule climbing meets &amp; events allowing members an opportunity to meet like-minded individuals, learn new skills and partake in [[lead climbing]] which by definition requires two or more individuals.

==Organization==

Climbing clubs are often affiliated to a [[Sport governing body|national governing or representative body]] for purposes of [[Liability insurance|public liability insurance]].

In the UK this is most often the [[British Mountaineering Council]]. In Ireland this is most often Mountaineering Ireland, [http://www.mountaineering.ie]

==Club facilities==

Clubs ''may'' typically provide:

* Scheduled meets &amp; training
* Mountain huts &amp; reciprocal arrangements with other hut owners
* Books, newsletters &amp; other publications
* Social events
* Limited public/civil liability insurance
* Rescue insurance
* Discount schemes with climbing shops
* Libraries &amp; photo collections
* Climbing grants
* Conservation, stewardship &amp; advocacy

[[Image:Maillotjaune.jpg|right|thumb|Commercial version of the yellow jersey, 2004]]
A '''cycling jersey''' is a specialized [[Jersey (clothing)|jersey]] for [[cycling]]. While the vast majority of cyclists worldwide wear conventional clothing while riding, a jersey offers certain advantages for the sport-oriented cyclist. A cycling jersey is cut long in the back to accommodate the bent-over position used in sport-oriented cycling. Any pockets on the jersey are placed on the back panel as front pockets would tend to spill. The [[zipper]] is often made very long so that the cyclist can open up the jersey to allow for ventilation. The cycling jersey is usually worn with a tight fit in order to reduce air resistance. Jerseys are made from a material designed to wick moisture from the skin, keeping the cyclist cooler and more comfortable.

Professional cycling is heavily [[sponsor (commercial)|sponsor]]ed; the traditional cycling jersey is printed with the [[logo]]s of a few of the [[cycling team]]'s sponsors.

==Origin==
Jerseys symbolising race positions include the [[yellow jersey]], or ''maillot jaune'', from the [[Tour de France]], the [[maglia rosa|pink jersey]], or ''maglia rosa'', from the [[Giro d'Italia]], and the red jersey, or ''la roja,'' from the Vuelta de Espana. The first two jerseys were given the same color as the paper their original main [[sponsor (commercial)|sponsor]]s (both sports newspapers)  were printed on: yellow and pink paper, respectively. The overall leader at the Vuelta at present wears a red jersey, although previously it has been the "maillot amarillo" (yellow jersey) and the "jersey de oro" (golden jersey). Many other jerseys are colored or designed after a sponsor's logo, and some jerseys change color when a new sponsor is found.

'''Doha Stadium''' ({{lang-he|אצטדיון דוחא}}, ''Etztadion Doha''; {{lang-ar|ستاد دوحة}}) is the current home of [[Bnei Sakhnin F.C.|Bnei Sakhnin]].

Located in the [[Israeli Arab]] [[Galilee]] city of [[Sakhnin]], it was built with public funds largely from the [[State of Israel]] and the [[Qatar Olympic Committee|Qatar National Olympic Committee]], and was named after the Qatari city of [[Doha]]. The decision by the Qataris to build the stadium in Israel came after a meeting between the [[Knesset]] member [[Ahmad Tibi]] and Secretary-General of the Qatar National Olympic Committee Sheikh [[Saud Abdulrahman Al Thani]] after Tibi expressed his concern on the conditions for sport in Sakhnin. The involvement of Qatar was to show that relations between the two nations are peaceful and with a similar interest.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Ro'ei |last=Nahmias |title=Why "Doha" Stadium and not "HaShalom"? |url=http://www.ynet.co.il/articles/1,7340,L-3200229,00.html |publisher=[[Yedioth Ahronoth]] |id= |pages= |page= |date=2006-01-14 |accessdate=2007-10-08 |language=Hebrew}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In July 2009, the north stand was opened with additional of 3,500 seats.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=The construction of the Doha stadium's north stand was completed |url=http://one.co.il/Msites/Biz/InsideArticle.aspx?id=141388&amp;bz=6 |publisher=One.co.il |id= |pages= |page= |date=2009-07-27 |accessdate=2009-07-27 |language=Hebrew}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are plans to expand the stadium's capacity to 15,000.

'''Estadio Antonio Vespucio Liberti''' ({{IPA-es|esˈtaðjo monumenˈtal anˈtonjo βesˈpusjo liˈβeɾti}}), also referred to as '''River Plate Stadium''', '''Monumental de Núñez''' or simply '''El Monumental''', is a [[stadium]] in the [[Belgrano, Buenos Aires|Belgrano]] district of [[Buenos Aires]], Argentina (although popular belief wrongly states that the stadium is in the [[Núñez, Buenos Aires|Núñez]] district), home of the football club [[Club Atlético River Plate|River Plate]].&lt;ref name=StadiumGuide&gt;{{cite web|last=The Stadium Guide|title=El Monumental|url=http://www.stadiumguide.com/elmonumental/|accessdate=11 May 2012|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120429023207/http://www.stadiumguide.com/elmonumental/|archivedate=29 April 2012|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was opened on 25 May 1938 and named after former club president [[Antonio Vespucio Liberti]]. It is the largest stadium in Argentina with a capacity of 66,266 and is also home of the [[Argentina national football team]]. It was the main venue in the [[1951 Pan American Games]]. It hosted the [[1978 FIFA World Cup Final]] between Argentina and the [[Netherlands national football team|Netherlands]]. Additionally, it hosted four finals of the [[Copa América]], most recently in [[2011 Copa América Final|2011]].

==History==

The [[Club Atlético River Plate]] was founded in 1901 and by 1934, it had won two championships. At the time, the club was nicknamed ''"Los Millonarios"'' (''The Millionaires'' in Spanish) because of the purchase of forward [[Carlos Peucelle]] for whom River had paid a huge amount of money. On October 31, 1934, River Plate purchased the land where the club was to build the new stadium in the neighborhood of [[Belgrano, Buenos Aires|Belgrano]].&lt;ref name="StadiumGuide" /&gt;

El Monumental was built on land reclaimed from the marshy coast of [[Río de la Plata]]. On May 25, 1935, the cornerstone was laid on the Centennial (now [[Avenida Figueroa Alcorta|Figueroa Alcorta]]) and Río de la Plata (Udaondo) Avenues. On December 1 of that year, the Steering Committee presented the approved project in detail to its members at an assembly. They obtained a loan of $2,500,000 from the government and on September 27, 1936, construction began under the direction of architects José Aslan and Héctor Ezcurra.

The initial cost of work reached the figure of $4,479,545.80, but was reduced to about 3 million dollars when the committee decided to halt the construction of the north end of the stadium due to a lack of adequate funds.&lt;ref name ="StadiumGuide" /&gt;

The foundation of the stadium was to be six or eight feet deep. This required open pit excavation to ensure the stability of the ground, and pumping bilge water from the site. The construction of the three stands was completed in two years. There are 50&amp;nbsp;km of steps, with 26,000 square meters of reinforced concrete and almost 3,000 tons of steel.

The stadium was inaugurated on Wednesday 25 May, amidst a crowd of approximately 65,000 people. They witnessed the handing over of an Argentine flag, one from the club, paid for by a group of associates, and then sang the national anthem and the River Plate chant.

The next day, nearly 68,000 spectators were present. After various activities the evening ended with a match between River Plate and [[Uruguayan Football Association|Uruguay]] team [[Peñarol]], with a 3–1 victory for the home squad.

In the 2016-17 league season, River Plate drew an average home attendance of 37,000, the second-highest in the league.

== Notable events ==
When the Monumental project was originally designed, it consisted of four double decker stands. As the bank loan was not enough to carry out the entire project, the stadium was left with a horseshoe shape. The horseshoe was partially enclosed in 1958, under the club presidency of Enrique Pardo. The new construction, the first tier Colonia stand, was financed by proceeds from the 10M pesos transfer of [[Omar Sivori]] to [[Juventus]] of Italy. With the new construction the stadium's capacity reached 90,000.

The stadium was remodelled and finally completed to meet the original project after Argentina was awarded the right to host the [[1978 World Cup]]. River Plate was lent money by the Military Government in charge of the country at the time but they struggled to meet repayments due to the changes of currency, which had a detrimental effect on the team. Monumental was the headquarters for the 1978 World Cup. The venue was opened on June 1 for the match between West Germany and Poland. They hosted seven more games, including the final between Argentina and the Netherlands.

[[San Lorenzo de Almagro|San Lorenzo]] earned the record for highest number of people attending a match for a visiting team in 1982. In their second division match against [[Club Atlético Tigre|Tigre]], San Lorenzo (which did not have a stadium at the time), brought more than 70,000 people to River's stadium. In 1975 when River played [[Racing Club de Avellaneda|Racing]] for the title (after an 18 years drought) 100,000 were present. At the end of the [[1986 Copa Libertadores#Final|1986]] and [[1996 Copa Libertadores#Final|1996]] [[Copa Libertadores]] second-leg finals (both against [[América de Cali]]), more seats were added and approximately 86,000 spectators were in attendance. It is estimated that for the Argentina versus Uruguay [[1987 Copa América]] semifinal more than 87,000 spectators attended. In 1993, in a qualification match for the [[1994 FIFA World Cup]], Argentina lost 5–0 to [[Colombia national football team|Colombia]], its greatest ever defeat at home. Since then, however, Argentina had never lost a match in World Cup qualifying within this stadium until [[Ecuador national football team|Ecuador]] won 2-0 on October 8, 2015.

The total length of the seating in the stands of the stadium is over 70 kilometers.

* In August 2015, the [[Ciudad Universitaria railway station|Ciudad Universitaria station]] was opened on the [[Belgrano Norte Line]] in order to serve both the stadium and the [[University of Buenos Aires]]' Ciudad Universitaria campus located on the other side of the tracks. The stadium is linked to the station with a viaduct and the line connects the stadium to both central [[Buenos Aires]] through its [[Retiro Belgrano railway station|Retiro terminal]] and also some of the city's northern outskirts.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.clarin.com/ciudades/Ciudad_de_Buenos_Aires-estacion_Ciudad_Universitaria_0_1421257923.html "Inauguran hoy la estación de tren de Ciudad Universitaria"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150830101905/http://www.clarin.com/ciudades/Ciudad_de_Buenos_Aires-estacion_Ciudad_Universitaria_0_1421257923.html |date=2015-08-30 }}, ''Clarín'', 29 Ago 2015&lt;/ref&gt; There were extensive renovations in the bathrooms, and led screens were installed in boxes and stalls.
* In November 2015, the [http://www.cariverplate.com.ar/museo-river River Plate Museum] was fully renewed: attractions were added and a River Plate store were built, where officially licensed products are sold.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.cariverplate.com.ar/se-reinauguro-el-museo-river|title=Se reinauguró el Museo River|last=Plate|first=Club Atletico River|newspaper=caRiverPlate.com.ar|access-date=2016-12-20|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160702153705/http://www.cariverplate.com.ar/se-reinauguro-el-museo-river|archivedate=2016-07-02|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{FC Drita sections}}
'''Football Club Drita''' ({{lang-sq|Klubi Futbollistik Drita}}), commonly known as '''Drita''' is a professional [[Football team|football club]] based in [[Gjilan]], [[Kosovo]]. The club play in the [[Football Superleague of Kosovo]], which is the top tier of football in the country.

==History==
In 1947, Drita was founded by the Gjilan citizens, the name Drita means [[light]] in [[Albanian language]] and the name was taken from other sports clubs from the city. The first club footballers trained under extraordinary circumstances and in difficult conditions, without food, just to succeed. They testified their talent with their inescapable will. From the beginning it was a snag of the communist government because it rivaled the other team of the city, their favorite, [[SC Gjilani|Crvena Zvezda Gnjilane]] and because the founders and footballers were only [[Albanians]] and had an Albanian name. Therefore, in 1952 the team is extinguished by the regime. Former footballers went to the already multi-ethnic team of Zvezda, but the team didn't completely get erased. They competed in the [[Football Superleague of Kosovo|Kosovo Province League]] where they were declared champions in the 1962–63 season.&lt;ref name=Drita&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dritafc.com/about.html|title=Historia e FC Drita|trans-title=History of FC Drita|language=Albanian|publisher=FC Drita}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

===Post-1990===
[[File:BekimIsufi (cropped).jpg|thumb|250px|[[Bekim Isufi]] was the most successful coach of Drita during Valon Murseli and Flamur Bunjaku era, he won [[2017–18 Football Superleague of Kosovo]], [[2018 Kosovar Supercup]] and assured Drita participation at European competitions.]]
In 1991. At the time of the dissolution of [[Yugoslavia]]. the football of Kosovo was in its zenith and consistently had 4-5 clubs in both federal leagues. But the deterioration of the political situation was also reflected in sports. In 1991, Albanian separatist complaining about the situation, formed the [[Football Federation of Kosovo]] with all its organs. Drita then joined the new league system in [[Kosovo]], where they played in the fields of the mountains around the city of [[Gjilan]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ffk-kosova.com/federata/hostoriku/|title=Historiku|trans-title=History|publisher=[[Football Federation of Kosovo]]|accessdate=2 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Selami Osmani era===
After the 90s, Drita was taken into management by Selami Osmani - Bezi with whom for 15 years reached the tops of Kosovan football, thanks to the players that brought in Gjilan, he who for 15 years contributed to Drita. Under his management Drita managed to adorn the title of the [[Football Superleague of Kosovo|Kosovo championship]] in 2002–03, win the cup in 2000–01 and be a runner-up in 1999–2000 and 2001–02. Drita also reached the semifinals in 1999–00, 2001–02 and 2002–03, breaking a Kosovo record that for four consecutive years did not descend below the third position and for four years at least until the semifinals of the [[Kosovar Cup]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://dritafc.com/rreth-nesh.html|title=Rreth nesh|trans-title=About us|language=Albanian|publisher=FC Drita}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Valon Murseli and Flamur Bunjaku era===
On 21 July 2016, Valon Murseli and Flamur Bunjaku took over the club, the two businessmans promised big things to the club, where in [[2017–18 Football Superleague of Kosovo|2017–18]] they relied on them, proclaiming champions for the second time in the clubs history.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://rajonipress.com/valon-murseli-e-flamur-bunjaku-premtojne-drita-do-te-shkelqej/|title=Valon Murseli e Flamur Bunjaku premtojnë Drita do të shkëlqej|trans-title=Valon Murseli and Flamur Bunjaku promise the Drita will shine|language=Albanian|website=RajoniPress|date=21 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Drita in the 1997–98 championship was great wherever in Kosovo and in many sporting games, the meetings started but it was difficult to name the fans. The [[KF Ballkani|Ballkani]] and Drita match was a tough game because Ballkani fought for the survival and Drita for champion, so the fans traveled to [[Suva Reka]] for the last time without a name after this game, before the game against biggest rival Gjilani, the board succumbed and after many debates the name {{nowrap|{{lang|sq|Intelektualët}} (Intellectuals)}} was assigned because most of the players except they played were also writers, poets, politicians and so on.&lt;ref name=Intelektualët&gt;{{cite web|url=http://tifozat.com/viewpage.php?page_id=11|title=Intelektualët|trans-title=Intellectuals|website=Tifozat}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Intellectuals are the biggest [[Ultras|ultras]] group in Kosovo, with many transfers outside Gjilan. They also have the record of audience in football of Kosovo, the biggest was against Gjilani in 2011 with 13,000 fans and they traveled also in 2002 with 30,000 fans to the final of the [[Kosovar Cup]] in the [[Fadil Vokrri Stadium]].&lt;ref name=Intelektualët/&gt;

===Incidents===
Also at {{nowrap|{{lang|sq|Intelektualet}} (Intellectuals)}} there are groups of hooligans who do incidents especially during the derby towards [[SC Gjilani|Gjilani]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://archive.koha.net/?id=&amp;l=71877|title=Rrahja ndërmjet tifozëve në derbin Drita-Gjilani [video]|trans-title=Beating between fans in derby Drita-Gjilani [video|language=Albanian|publisher=[[Koha Ditore]]|date=23 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

But there are also other incidents with other groups, The incident with {{nowrap|{{lang|sq|Plisat}}}} of [[FC Prishtina|Prishtina]] was where during the last game of the championship there was attack on the fans of Prishtina, the worst incident was the violation of the fans of Prishtina by the hooligans from Gjilan where 13 fans were injured.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://zeri.info/sport/199620/momenti-kur-makina-e-intelektualeve-shkele-qellimisht-plisat-dhe-perleshja-mes-tifozeve/|title=Momenti kur makina e Intelektualëve shkelë qëllimisht Plisat dhe përleshja mes tifozëve|trans-title=The moment when the car of Intellectual intentionally violates the Plisat and the clash between the fans|language=Albanian|website=Zeri|accessdate=19 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://indeksonline.net/vetura-me-tabela-te-gjilanit-godet-tifozet-e-prishtines-ne-peje-video-foto/|title=Vetura me tabela të Gjilanit godet tifozët e Prishtinës në Pejë|trans-title=The car with vehicle plates of Gjilan strikes Pristina fans in Peja|language=Albanian|website=Indeksonline|accessdate=19 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Club rivalries==
[[File:The Kosovo Derby at Gjilan City Stadium in 2018.jpg|thumb|250px|The [[Kosovo Derby]] at [[Gjilan City Stadium]] in 30 September 2018]]
===Gjilani===
{{see also|Kosovo Derby}}
There is often a fierce rivalry between the two strongest teams in a national league and this is particularly the case in the Football Superleague of Kosovo, where the game between Drita and [[SC Gjilani|Gjilani]] is known as the [[Kosovo Derby]]. According to the tradition of the city of Gjilan, the party starts with fans organization, who try to give the maximum support for the respective clubs, there is also some surprise for the other opponent camp, to say that we were better and is appreciated more than what is presented to you with great curiosity about the whole city, what a presentation will be on the weekend from {{nowrap|{{lang|sq|Skifterat}} (Falcons)}} and {{nowrap|{{lang|sq|Intelektualët}} (Intellectuals)}}.

Three days before the match the derby gives the atmosphere a night life, everywhere in the cafe bars is an atmosphere that occurs only during national holidays, where fans are seen by both the {{nowrap|{{lang|sq|Skifterat}} (Falcons)}} and {{nowrap|{{lang|sq|Intelektualët}} (Intellectuals)}} to live all that week under the fever of the much-anticipated derby.

One hour before the match, the two camps are organized in groups and always avoid eventual incidents between the two ultras groups. They divide the streets from where they will go to the stadium, which is good, because the [[Kosovo Police]] organised themselves in a way to avoid the breakdown of this holiday and the much anticipated confrontation in Gjilan.

For a brief few moments, everything apart from the dozens of flares that littered the pitch, that'd had disappeared from view. Gone were the two white minarets that usually overlook the stadium in eastern Kosovo. Gone too were the lines of riot police patrolling the front of the main stand along with the 10,000 strong crowd, all enveloped in a monstrous blue cloud of smoke. On the other side of the pitch, a similar scene was being played out, but the consuming cloud was red. The only evidence of a football match being played was the thunderous noise of drums and chants rising ethereally from the fog.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Kosovo: new nation, fresh problems|url=http://www.worldsoccer.com/features/kosovo-new-nation-fresh-problems-390837#jzZlcKyWupdVDG3g.99|website=Worldsoccer.com|publisher=James Montague|accessdate=20 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Kit evolution==
After the war, the financial condition of clubs did not allow them to look after their kits, it happened that within a season the club's shirts have changed. But since joining [[UEFA]] and [[FIFA]], this problem has disappeared. During the presentation of Betim Haxhimusa, they also unveiled the new kits that would be worn in the 2018–19 season, while the traditional colors are interwoven in a design inspired by the famous sportswear brand [[Givova]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://gazetaolle.com/keto-jane-fanellat-e-drites-per-edicionin-e-ardhshem/|title=Këto janë fanellat e Dritës për edicionin e ardhshëm|trans-title=These are the kits of Drita for the upcoming edition|language=Albanian|website=GazetaOlle|accessdate=22 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; While in the UEFA Champions League match against [[Malmö FF|Malmö]] in [[Sweden]], Drita played with their third kits making the presentation in public for the first time.

'''Hearnes Center''' is a 13,611-seat multi-purpose [[arena]] in [[Columbia, Missouri]]. The arena opened in 1972. It is currently home to the Missouri Tigers'  [[Collegiate wrestling|wrestling]] and volleyball teams as well as the school's [[artistic gymnastics|gymnastics]] and indoor [[track &amp; field]] teams.  It was home to the [[University of Missouri]] Tigers [[basketball]] [[team]] before [[Mizzou Arena]] opened in 2004.

Groundbreaking for the Hearnes Center occurred in 1969, and the arena was officially dedicated on August 4, 1972. The arena got its name from former Missouri governor and 1952 Mizzou graduate [[Warren Hearnes]]. The cost of the building project was $10.75 million. Prior to the opening of the Hearnes Center, the Missouri basketball team played its home games at [[Brewer Fieldhouse]], which was built in 1929 and has since been remodeled into a modern recreation center. 

Hearnes quickly became one of the toughest places to play during the 1980s, when players such as [[Steve Stipanovich]], [[Jon Sundvold]], [[Derrick Chievous]] and [[Doug Smith (basketball)|Doug Smith]] suited up for [[Norm Stewart]]. Several factors contributed to this reputation: the steep banking of the seating area, its flat roof and angling of its upper sections, and [[The Antlers (University of Missouri)|The Antlers]], whose presence in Section A-16 made them the bane of many an opposition. Decibel meters were added to the corners of the arena in the early 1990s in addition to new scoreboards, and it was not uncommon to see them go well above 110 dB during conference games, and regularly cresting 125 dB against [[Kansas Jayhawks basketball|Kansas]] or during 2001's famed "Fire Code Game" against [[2001–02 Iowa Hawkeyes men's basketball team|Iowa]], where well over 14,500 people packed the building to see then-#2 Mizzou be stunned by [[Steve Alford]]'s club.

In its later life, the building saw several changes: a new floor was installed in 1998, rear-projection video monitors replaced the matrix boards at the turn of the new millennium, and the student seating plan was also altered. Before [[Quin Snyder]] came to coach the Tigers, student seating was scattered throughout the arena and distributed via who picked up tickets first, and while the largest amount sat along one sideline (including the band, Student Athletic Board and the aforementioned Antlers), others sat as high as the D sections, which early in the arena's life doubled as lecture halls (to this day, their seats have fold-out writing desks). Attempting to create an atmosphere similar to his former employers, [[Duke Blue Devils basketball|Duke]], Snyder mandated that all students be moved to one end of the court, where bleachers would replace the old seats and primacy would be given to his new "Zou Crew" club, with all other seating areas becoming general admission. The move was criticized for changing the atmosphere at Missouri games to something less distinctive while enabling more seats to be sold at a higher cost, but was duplicated (with more restrictions on student seating) at Mizzou Arena.

The Hearnes Center also contains a field house that is home to the indoor track and field team, as well as one of the country's largest [[blood donation|blood drives]]. Each fall, students donate blood as part of the school's [[Homecoming]] week festivities. In 2005, students and [[Columbia, Missouri|Columbia]] residents donated over 5,000 units of blood.  
[[Image:HearnesCenter2.jpg|thumb|left|150px]]During the school year, the parking lot adjacent to the main building serves as student parking for the many on-campus residents.

The '''[[Koninklijk]]e Nederlandse Cricket Bond''' ('''KNCB'''; English: Royal Dutch Cricket Board) is the governing body of [[cricket]] in the [[Kingdom of the Netherlands]]. It was formed in 1883 and received a Royal charter in 1958. The KNCB is responsible for the [[Netherlands national cricket team|national men's]] and [[Netherlands national women's cricket team|women's team]]s, and also for the various domestic competitions, including the [[Topklasse (cricket)|Topklasse]] (Division One) and [[Hoofdklasse (cricket)|Hoofdklasse]] (Division Two) leagues, and the [[Dutch Twenty20 Cup|Twenty20 Cup]]. The KNCB has been an associate member of the [[International Cricket Council]] since 1966. It is one of the oldest national governing bodies in the sport, older than those of many full ICC members. The KNCB is also a member of the [[European Cricket Council]], which organises the [[European Cricket Championship]].

==Overview==
Koninklijke Nederlandse Cricket Bond is an administrative organization responsible for the promotion, development, and organization of the sport of [[cricket]] in the Netherlands. It controls the [[Netherlands national cricket team|men's national team]], and the [[Netherlands national women's cricket team|women's national team]] teams. The women's national team currently have [[Test cricket|Test status]] and played their first Test match in 2007. A total of 57 cricket clubs take part in the domestic season, which include the Hoofdklasse, Topklasse and the region T20 cricket.&lt;ref&gt;

==History==
Cricket was first seen being played on Dutch soil in the 1780s by an English traveller in Scheveningen, and by the turn of the 20th century, Dutch teams were touring England regularly. Cricket was one of the most popular sports in the Netherlands in the 19th century, surpassed since by many other sports, most notably association football. Cricket even found enough of a following to survive the German occupation of the country between May 1940 and May 1945. The sport, famously dismissed as "unmanly and un-German" and "insufficiently violent" by [[Adolf Hitler]] himself, endured thanks in no small part to the dogged enthusiasm of local players, who shrugged off the requisitioning of grounds and restrictions on weekend travel – not to mention the presence of thousands of heavily armed Nazis and the bombing of the main sports dealers in Rotterdam – to organise as many as 300 matches a year.&lt;ref&gt;

The Dutch participated in the [[1996 Cricket World Cup]], [[2003 Cricket World Cup]], [[2007 Cricket World Cup]], and [[2011 Cricket World Cup]]. In their debut campaign, they lost all of their matches barring a respectful performance against England. They qualified for the 2003 edition after winning the [[2001 ICC Trophy]],&lt;ref&gt;

It was around this time that stars and excellent cricketers like [[Ronald Lefebvre]] and [[Ryan ten Doeschate]] started emerging to make Dutch cricket much more strong.

===Present Day===
The Dutch qualified for the 2007 World Cup with a fifth-place finish at the [[2005 ICC Trophy]].&lt;ref&gt;

After years of stagnation, the women's game is also developing rapidly in the Netherlands. Recently, the women's team outshone the men's team and they were given [[Test cricket]] status by the ICC in 2007 unlike their male counterparts.

==Name Change==
Before 1958 it was known as the Nederlandse Cricket Bond or the Dutch Cricket Board. After receiving a Royal charter in 1958, a "Royal" was added before the board's name known simply as [[Koninklijk]]e in Dutch. The following names have been for the board in their history:-
* Nederlandse Cricket Bond (Dutch Cricket Board)
* [[Koninklijk]]e Nederlandse Cricket Bond (Royal Dutch Cricket Board)

==Competitions==
As well as maintaining Dutch international sides, the KNCB is also responsible for managing the regional domestic competitions. The following domestic competitions are organized in the Netherlands:-
* [[Topklasse (cricket)|Topklasse]]
* [[Hoofdklasse (cricket)|Hoofdklasse]]
* [[Eerste Klasse (cricket)|Eerste Klasse]]
* Topklasse Twenty20 Cup
In addition, a number of youth programs as well as ladies programs are organized in the Netherlands.&lt;ref&gt;

==Women's cricket==
The Netherlands Women's Team was traditionally weak but in the last few years, they have made tremendous development, gaining Test status and out showing the men in recent times.

==Sponsorship==
[[Amul]] was the official sponsor of the Dutch cricket team during the [[2011 Cricket World Cup]].&lt;ref&gt;

[[File:SomeWheatiesBoxes.jpg|thumb|right|234px|Some Wheaties boxes with athletes or teams on the packaging, from the late 1990s.]]
In 1934, the [[breakfast cereal]] [[Wheaties]] began the practice of including pictures of [[sportsperson|athletes]] on its packaging to coincide with its [[slogan]], "The Breakfast of Champions." In its original form, athletes were depicted on the sides or back of the cereal box, though in 1958 Wheaties began placing the pictures on the front of the box. The tradition has included hundreds of athletes from many different sports, and also team depictions.

This article lists the athletes or teams depicted on Wheaties boxes, along with the year(s) of depiction and sport played. This list is not all-inclusive, and athletes may have been shown together with teams and groups, or on the sides, back, or front of the box. Most athletes appeared on the standard Wheaties box, while others appeared on the Honey Frosted Wheaties (HFW), Crispy Wheaties 'n' Raisins (CWR), Wheaties Energy Crunch (WEC), or Wheaties Fuel (WF) boxes.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="19844">The '''Ms. International''' [[female bodybuilding]] contest was considered to be the second-most prestigious  competition for [[female bodybuilding|female bodybuilders]] (second only to the [[Ms. Olympia]] competition), from its inception in 1986 through 2013.  It was first held in 1986 by the [[International Federation of BodyBuilders]] (IFBB.). In 1987 the IFBB allowed the [[Amateur Athletic Union]] (AAU) to sanction the Ms. International as an amateur event. In 1988 the contest was again sanctioned by the IFBB. From 1989 on, the contest was part of the [[Arnold Sports Festival]].

The top all-time winners are [[Iris Kyle]] with seven titles and followed by [[Yaxeni Oriquen-Garcia]] with five titles. The only amateur to win the overall title was [[Kathy Segal]].

In 2013, it was announced that IFBB would drop the Ms. International from 2014 IFBB Pro Schedule.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://siteok.net/d/iron_man_usa_pdf/2009-06.pdf |title=2014 IFBB Pro Schedule |date=November 27, 2013 |publisher=musculardevelopment |accessdate=December 4, 2013 |deadurl=unfit |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140527220959/http://siteok.net/d/iron_man_usa_pdf/2009-06.pdf |archivedate=May 27, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==

=== 1986–1988 ===
The first Ms. International was held in 1986, and was sanctioned by the [[International Federation of BodyBuilders]] (I.F.B.B.). The contest was held in conjunction with the men’s event, which was called the IFBB Pro World Championship. Ben Weider proclaimed that the top six finishers would qualify for IFBB pro status, and be invited to compete at the 1986 IFBB Pro World in Toronto. The 1986 and 1988 Ms. Internationals were designated as pro-am contests, and top amateurs were also invited to compete. In 1987, the Ms. International was an amateur event sanctioned by the AAU. In 1988, [[Jim Lorimer (promoter)|Jim Lorimer]] and [[Arnold Schwarzenegger]] felt the women’s competition should become a regular event along with the men’s.&lt;ref name="themsinternational"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://siteok.net/d/iron_man_usa_pdf/2009-06.pdf |title=The Ms. International |deadurl=unfit |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140527220959/http://siteok.net/d/iron_man_usa_pdf/2009-06.pdf |archivedate=May 27, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== 1989–1999 ===
Since 1989, the men’s Pro World Championship was renamed the Arnold Schwarzenegger Classic and the Ms. International become part of The [[Arnold Classic|Arnold Classic Weekend]]. That same year Tonya Knight had to forfeit both her placing and prize money from the 1988 and 1989 Ms. International when it was found out that she used someone else to take her drug test at the 1989 Ms. Olympia. The first most narrowest victory came in 1991 when Tonya Knight topped Anja Schreiner by a score of 30 to 32.&lt;ref name="themsinternational" /&gt; There has been some controversy at the 1992 Ms. International. [[Anja Schreiner]] and [[Paula Bircumshaw]] both had the same body height, however Paula had much more muscle and weight (162&amp;nbsp;lbs). The judges regulated her to eighth place and the judges did not, as custom, called out out the top ten competitors on stage before announcing the winners.  However this time, they only announced the top six competitors on stage in order to prevent Paula back on stage. The audience rioted over this decision and changed Paula's name. Paula did come back on stage only to give the judges the middle finger. Because of this she was given a year's suspension. In 1996, [[Kim Chizevsky-Nicholls]] became the first to win both Ms. International and [[Ms. Olympia]] in the same year.

=== 2000–2005 ===
The 2000 contest saw the introduction of weight classes, with a [[posedown]] between the two class winners to decide the overall championship. In 2004, Iris Kyle won her first heavyweight and overall Ms. Intentional. In 2005, Iris skipped the Ms. International, and focused defending her Olympia title, allowing Yaxeni Oriquen-Garcia to win.

=== 2006–2013 ===
The contest reverted to the single, open-class format in 2006. In 2006 and 2007, Iris won both Ms. Internationals. In 2007, the [[National Physique Committee|NPC]] [[Arnold Amateur]] was created as part of the Arnold Classic Weekend, which contained [[amateur]] women's bodybuilding. The Arnold Amateur Ms. International, unlike Arnold Classic Ms. International, contains weight classes. From 2007 to 2010 the Arnold Amateur Ms. International contained three weight classes, lightweight, middleweight, and heavyweight. The overall winner of the Amateur Ms. International win an IFBB pro card. In 2011, the middleweight was removed.

There was a bit of a controversy in the 2008 Ms. International. Iris was placed 7th due to "bumps" on her gluts which according to head IFBB judge, Sandy Ranalli, “distortions in her physique.”,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://thinksteroids.com/news/iris-kyle-discusses-ms-international-results-with-pro-bodybuilding-weekly/|title=Iris Kyle Discusses Ms International Results with Pro Bodybuilding Weekly|publisher=MESO-Rx|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140108094607/http://thinksteroids.com/news/iris-kyle-discusses-ms-international-results-with-pro-bodybuilding-weekly/|archivedate=2014-01-08|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The second most narrowest victory in Ms. International history came at the 2008 Ms. International, when Yaxeni Oriquen-Garcia edged runner-up Dayana Cadeau, by the score of 30 to 32.&lt;ref name="themsinternational" /&gt; Iris Kyle rebounded at the 2009 Ms. International, which she won. Iris went on to win both the 2010 and 2011 Ms. International. Due to a leg injury Iris could not compete in the 2012 Ms. International, which was won by Yaxeni Oriquen-Garcia. In 2013, Iris Kyle won back her Ms. International title.

On June 7, 2013, event promoter of the Arnold Sports Festival, [[Jim Lorimer (promoter)|Jim Lorimer]], announced that in 2014, the Arnold Classic 212  professional men’s bodybuilding division would replace the Ms. International women’s bodybuilding competition at the 2014 Arnold Sports Festival. Lorimer, in a statement, said “The Arnold Sports Festival was proud to support women’s bodybuilding through the Ms. International for the past quarter century, but in keeping with demands of our fans, the time has come to introduce the Arnold Classic 212 beginning in 2014. We are excited to create a professional competitive platform for some of the IFBB Pro League’s most popular competitors.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hardbodynews.com/2013/06/07/ms-international-dropped-from-2014-arnold-sports-festival/#sthash.IxIPPWAR.dpbs|title=Ms. International Dropped from 2014 Arnold Sports Festival|date=June 7, 2013|publisher=Hard Body News|accessdate=December 4, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== 2018 ===
On January 5, 2018, Beth Mandyck, a female bodybuilder, filed a sex discrimination lawsuit with the city of [[Columbus, Ohio]] over the IFBB cancelling the Ms. International from the Arnold Sports Festival. She has also started a [[change.org]] petition. Her complaint has been backed by Iris Kyle, [[Nancy Hogshead-Makar]], former Olympic gold medalist and the CEO of Champion Women, an advocacy group for women in sports, and [[Women's Sports Foundation]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nbcnews.com/news/sports/female-bodybuilder-alleges-gender-discrimination-arnold-sports-festival-n844751 Female bodybuilder alleges gender discrimination at Arnold Sports Festival]&lt;/ref&gt;

It will have a capacity of 40,143 people. The stadium is a part of the '''Olympic Complex of Oran'''. it will be used as the opening and closing ceremony venue of the [[2021 Mediterranean Games]].

==History==
===Construction===
[[File:Stade Abdelkader Freha.png|left|200px|thumb|Stadium under construction]]
On December 20, 2006, planned the project of construction of the Olympic Complex. The stadium was planned for a capacity of 75,000 seats but was reduced to 40.000.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.vitaminedz.com/son-etude-a-ete-presentee-hier-a-l-hemicycle-de-la-wilaya-d/Articles_0_131120_31_1.html |title=Le stade olympique amputé de 35.000 places |work=La Voix de l'Oranie |publisher=Sofiane |date=December 21, 2006 |accessdate= }}&lt;/ref&gt;
On December 5, 2011, the minister of Youth and Sports, El Hachemi Djiar, announced that the stadium would be completed before the end of 2012.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lequotidien-oran.com/index.php?news=5161248 Djiar à Oran: Le stade olympique livré avant fin 2012]; Le Quotidien d'Oran, December 5, 2011&lt;/ref&gt; He also added that the entire project would be finished in 2015. But due to delays in construction work, the complex will be finished in 2018.

===Name of the stadium===
In 2014, M. [[Mohamed Raouraoua]] president of the [[Algerian Football Federation]] suggested that the stadium can take the name of the former legendary footballer of [[MC Oran]] and of the national team [[Abdelkader Fréha]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.dzairnews.com/articles/elwatan-sport-le-nouveau-stade-d-oran-sera-baptise-abdelkader-freha Le nouveau stade d’Oran sera baptisé Abdelkader Fréha] - DzairNews, May 22, 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
===Allianz sponsorship===
All started when, in 2015, [[Allianz]] became new top sponsor of the Italian basketball team [[Pallacanestro Trieste]], based in PalaTrieste.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ilgiornaledellosport.net/notizie/basket/2016/09/26/66995-allianz-pallacanestro-trieste-2004-partnership-prosegue-la-stagione-20162017/ |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |date=23 March 2017 |title=Allianz e Pallacanestro Trieste 2004: una partnership che prosegue per la stagione 2016/2017|website=ilgiornaledellosport.net|language=Italian |trans-title=Allianz and Pallacanestro Trieste 2004: a partnership that goes on for the 2016/2017 season}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2017, the German insurance company sponsored a new parquet basketball court,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.triesteprima.it/sport/allianz-italia-e-pallacanestro-trieste-2004-occasione-dell-allianz-day-la-partnership-porta-in-dote-il-nuovo-parquet-all-alma-arena-23-marzo-2017.html |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |date=23 March 2017 |title=All'Alma arena come in Nba: nuovo parquet firmato Allianz|website=triesteprima.it|language=Italian |trans-title=Alma arena like Nba: new parquet sponsored by Allianz}}&lt;/ref&gt; and later in 2018, a new scoreboard called ''Allianz Wall'' was installed in the Trieste arena.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.pallacanestrotrieste2004.it/allianz-wall-pronto-segnapunti-4-megaschermi-dellalma-arena/ |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |date=13 March 2018 |title=ALLIANZ WALL: PRONTO IL NUOVO SEGNAPUNTI CON 4 MEGASCHERMI DELL’ALMA ARENA |website=pallacanestrotrieste2004.it |language=Italian |trans-title=Allianz Wall: new scoreboard of Alma Arena with 4 large screens is ready}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2018 Allianz signed a deal to became new title sponsor of the arena, so PalaTrieste officially became '''Allianz Dome''' until 2023.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://m.ilpiccolo.gelocal.it/sport/2018/06/12/news/trieste-allianz-sponsorizzera-il-palasport-del-basket-si-chiamera-allianz-dome-1.16955337 |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |date=12 June 2018 |title=Trieste, Allianz sponsorizzerà il palasport del basket: si chiamerà Allianz Dome |website=ilpiccolo.gelocal.it |language=Italian |trans-title=Trieste, Allianz will sponsored the basketball palasport: it will be called Allianz dome}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The teams also compete in a domestic cup competition each year, called the [[Copa del Rey de Waterpolo|Copa del Rey]]. The winners of the División de Honor play against the winners of the Copa del Rey in the [[Supercopa de España de Waterpolo]] (Super Cup).
