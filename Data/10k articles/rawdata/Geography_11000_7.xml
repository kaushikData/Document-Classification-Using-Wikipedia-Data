The '''74th parallel north''' is a [[circle of latitude]] that is 74 [[degree (angle)|degrees]] [[true north|north]] of the [[Earth|Earth's]] [[equator|equatorial plane]], in the [[Arctic]]. It crosses the [[Atlantic Ocean]], [[Europe]], [[Asia]], the [[Arctic Ocean]], and [[North America]].

==Around the world==
Starting at the [[Prime Meridian]] and heading eastwards, the parallel 74° north passes through:

[[File:Vertical Temperature Profile in Permafrost (English Text).jpg|thumb|The red dotted-to-solid line depicts the average temperature profile with depth of soil in a permafrost region. The trumpet-shaped lines at the top show seasonal maximum and minimum temperatures in the "active layer", which commences at the depth where the maximum annual temperature intersects 0° C. The active layer is seasonally frozen. The middle zone is permanently frozen as "permafrost". And the bottom layer is where the geothermal temperature is above freezing. Note the importance of the vertical 0° C line: It denotes the bottom of the active layer in the seasonally variable temperature zone and the bottom limit of permafrost as the temperature increases with depth.]]
In environments containing [[permafrost]], the '''active layer''' is the top layer of [[soil]] that thaws during the summer and freezes again during the autumn. In all [[climate]]s, whether they contain permafrost or not, the temperature in the lower levels of the soil will remain more stable than that at the surface, where the influence of the ambient [[temperature]] is greatest. This means that, over many years, the influence of cooling in winter and heating in summer (in temperate climates) will decrease as depth increases.&lt;ref&gt;{{citebook|title=Fundamentals of Geomorphology |author= Richard John Huggett|year=2003|publisher=Routledge|isbn=0-415-24145-6|page=237}}&lt;/ref&gt;

If the winter temperature is below the freezing point of [[water]], a '''frost front''' will form in the soil. This "frost front" is the boundary between frozen and unfrozen soil, and with the coming of spring and summer, the soil is thawed, ''always from the top down''. If the heating during summer exceeds the cooling during winter, the soil will be completely thawed during the summer and there will be no permafrost. This occurs when the mean annual temperature is above 0°C (32°F), but also occurs when the mean annual temperature is slightly below 0°C on sites exposed to the sun with coarse-textured parent materials ([[vegetation]]).

When there is not sufficient heat to thaw the frozen soil completely, permafrost forms. The active layer in this environment consists of the top layers of soil which thaws during the summer, while the '''inactive layer''' refers to the soil below which is frozen year-round because the heat fails to penetrate. Liquid water cannot flow below the active layer, with the result that permafrost environments tend to be very poorly drained and boggy.

==Thaw depth in permafrost areas==
The thickness of the active layer is the average annual [[thaw depth]] in permafrost areas, due to solar heating of the surface.

Thus, the primary determinant of active layer thickness is the maximum temperature attained during the summer. If it is only a little above 0°C, the active layer can be very thin (only 10 cm on [[Ellesmere Island]]), whilst if it is quite warm, it is much thicker (about 2.5 m at [[Yakutsk]]), and if the permafrost is discontinuous and soil begins thawing earlier, it can be still thicker (5 meters at [[Yellowknife, Northwest Territories|Yellowknife]]). The parent material of the soil is also important: active layers in soils made of [[sand]]y or [[gravel]]ly parent materials can be up to five times deeper than those made from [[loam]]- or [[clay]]-rich parent material. This is because the coarser material allows for much greater conductivity of heat down into the soil.

This is important because [[root]]s of [[plant]]s cannot penetrate beyond the active layer and are restricted by its thickness. Thus, in a continuous permafrost environment plants must have shallow roots, which restricts [[tree]] growth to specialised species such as ''[[larch|Larix]]''. In areas of discontinuous permafrost, most [[conifer]]s are able to grow easily.

==Soil formation in the active layer==
[[Cryoturbation]] is the dominant force operating in the active layer, and tends to make it generally uniform in composition throughout. However, variation in the composition of soils due to differences in parent rock are very marked in permafrost regions due to the low rate of weathering in the very cold climate.

The slow rate of decomposition of organic material means [[gelisols]] (permafrost soils) are very important as a sink for [[carbon dioxide]]. This carbon dioxide and other [[greenhouse gases]] (chiefly [[methane]]) forms from the very slow decomposition of the excess organic matter that remains in most gelisols and is mixed down into the [[pereletok layer]] during relatively hot summers and below that layer during warmer periods about 5000 to 6000 years ago. This storage of carbon means thawing of permafrost may accelerate [[global warming]] - some suggest the difference could become very significant especially if the carbon has been stored since ''before'' the recent glacial maxima.

{{Armenia sidebar}}

[[Armenia]] is subdivided into eleven [[country subdivision|administrative divisions]]. Of these, ten are provinces, known as ''marzer'' ({{lang|hy|մարզեր}}) or in the singular form ''[[marz (country subdivision)|marz]]'' ({{lang|hy|մարզ}}) in [[Armenian language|Armenian]].

[[Yerevan]] is treated separately and granted special administrative status as the country's capital.  The chief executive in each of 10 marzer is the ''marzpet'', appointed by the government of Armenia. In Yerevan, the chief executive is the mayor, appointed by the president.

==First-level administrative entities==
The following is a list of the regions with population, area, and density information.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.armstat.am/file/doc/99475033.pdf|title=Provinces: area, population and density|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Figures are from the National Statistical Service of the Republic of Armenia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.armstat.am/file/article/nasel_01.01.2016.pdf|title=Estimated population of Armenia as of 01.01.2016|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Note that the area of the Gegharkunik Province includes [[Lake Sevan]] which covers {{convert|1278|km2|sqmi}} of its territory. To sort the information, use the arrow devices in the table headings.

==Municipal communities (''hamaynkner'')==
{{main|Municipalities of Armenia}}
Within each province are municipal communities (''hamaynkner'', singular ''hamaynk''). Each community is self-governing and consists of one or more settlements (''bnakavayrer'', singular ''bnakavayr''). Settlements are classified as either towns (''kaghakner'', singular ''kaghak'') or villages (''gyugher'', singular ''gyugh''). As of January 2018, Armenia is divided into 503 communities, of which 46 are urban and 457 are rural. The capital, Yerevan, also holds the status of a community.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Regions|url=http://www.gov.am/en/regions/|publisher=The Government of Armenia}}&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, Yerevan is divided into twelve semi-autonomous districts.

'''Albert Morris''' (13 August 1886 in Bridgetown, [[South Australia]] &amp;ndash; 9 January 1939, [[Broken Hill]]), was a highly acclaimed amateur Australian [[botanist]], [[landscaper]], [[ecologist]], conservationist and pioneer developer of the re-vegetation technique ''natural regeneration'' who also utilised restoration principles that are today known as ''[[ecological restoration]]''. 

==Early life==
Albert was born in Bridgetown, South Australia to parents Albert Joseph Morris and Emma Jane (Smith).&lt;ref&gt;Kennedy 1986&lt;/ref&gt; His family was confronted with the economic depression in South Australia in the late 1880s, and Morris's father sought work in the new mines of the Barrier ranges and moved his family to Thackaringa, [[New South Wales]] and then to nearby Broken Hill, New South Wales, to live.&lt;ref&gt;Kennedy 1986&lt;/ref&gt; Broken Hill was to become Albert's permanent home.

Early in life, Albert developed a keen interest in plants. It is possible that a serious injury to his foot in his early childhood which prevented him from taking part in the bustle of childhood activity, contributed to his independence and self-containment, and to an increasing interest in [[botany]]. However, it is documented that his father, Joe Morris, was an "enthusiastic" botanist and young Albert was his "offsider", so this  was a more likely source of his botanical interests, as well as innate talent and an interest in the subject.&lt;ref&gt;"Comments of readers: Appreciation of Late Mr A Morris" in "Barrier Miner" 14/01/39&lt;/ref&gt; By the time he was undertaking technical school studies in [[metallurgy]] and [[assay]]ing, Morris had developed a small garden and nursery, and contributed to the cost of his fees by selling plants (pepper trees) that he had grown. Morris took up work with the Central Mine at Broken Hill, eventually becoming chief assayer for this mining company.&lt;ref&gt;Kennedy 1986&lt;/ref&gt;

Morris was married at Broken Hill on 13 April 1909 to Ellen Margaret Sayce (1887-1957), known as Margaret Morris, a dressmaker who had studied art in Adelaide. Margaret also developed skilled amateur interests in botany, conservation and journalism.&lt;ref&gt;Ardill 2017&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Morris 1939&lt;/ref&gt; She was a member of the [[Society of Friends]], (Quakers). Albert's formative years were spent as an Anglican and "some years" after his marriage he converted to Quakerism.&lt;ref&gt;Morris, M. 1966&lt;/ref&gt; They built a cottage in Cornish Street, Railway Town (a suburb of Broken Hill). This was an area of Broken Hill that was extremely exposed to the fierce westerly winds of the region and the resultant soil erosion and drifting sand; trees had been cut for fuel and years of overstocking and the rabbit plague had denuded the land. Broken Hill was severely affected by drifting sand and dust, which in summer became major dust storms making work and domestic life difficult.&lt;ref&gt;Morris, M. 1966&lt;/ref&gt;

==The Broken Hill work of Albert Morris==
=== Amenity and ecological restoration ===

From time immemorial the traditional owners of the lands around Broken Hill were the [[Wilyakali]] people. Over some sixty years of European dispossession, colonisation and settlement (c.1870-c.1930), the once well-vegetated, indigenous fauna rich and soil stable landscape of the Barrier Ranges had progressively been devastated by pastoral overstocking, exotic animals such as rabbits, foxes and [[feral]] goats, mining and its residues, and by the impacts of a large urban settlement of people and their stock. Natural recovery from these detrimental impacts was inhibited by the semi-arid climate which consisted of low average rainfall of 250mm pr annum and high summer temperatures.&lt;ref&gt;Beadle 1948; Ardill 2017&lt;/ref&gt; 

As early as 1908, newspaper comments indicated that the [[sheet erosion]] around Broken Hill had already begun. Morris described the degraded landscape in these terms: 
''"The extending country stretched for miles without a vestige of any green thing and each stone or old tin had a streamer of sand tailing out from it. The fences were piled high with sand, inside and out and it looked as if the intended railway lines would just be buried every dusty day, which was every windy day"''.&lt;ref&gt;Morris, A. 1938&lt;/ref&gt; 

Albert was concerned about the detrimental impact that the local erosion and sand storms had on the amenity of his fellow citizens of Broken Hill, as houses and gardens were immersed in sand. He lamented the loss of indigenous fauna species due to the destruction of their natural habitats, and the breakdown of local ecosystems and their beauty. He looked for ways to manage these issues.&lt;ref&gt;Morris, A. 1938; Ardill 2017&lt;/ref&gt; Several failures at establishing a barrier to the wind blown sand deposits in his garden inspired Morris to search for plants that could be grown in the prevailing tough arid conditions and control erosion by binding the bare soil.&lt;ref&gt;Morris, M. 1966&lt;/ref&gt; He began to acquire expertise with botanical taxonomy and systematics and by the mid 1920s was corresponding with other Australian botanists. &lt;ref&gt;Morris 1966; Ardill 2017&lt;/ref&gt;.. He established a home nursery, purchasing adjoining land so he could expand it and his garden. He made [[field trips]] into the country around Broken Hill, studying and collecting specimens of the indigenous [[flora]] and observing the local [[ecosystems]]. 
 
===Barrier Field Naturalists Club===


In 1920 with Margaret Morris and [http://oa.anu.edu.au/obituary/macgillivray-william-david-15571 W.D.K. McGillivray] (1868-1933), a local doctor and also a prominent Australian ornithologist and natural scientist, Albert helped establish the Broken Hill-based Barrier Field Naturalists Club and acted as its secretary until his death in 1939. &lt;ref&gt;Morris M. 1966; Ardill 2017&lt;/ref&gt; The Club focused on the study of the natural sciences and was particularly active in the fields of botany, history and geology, conducting regular field trips and lecture series. Albert and Margaret participated prominently in the club's activities. As well as Margaret's diverse contributions, it is important to note that throughout the 1920s and 1930s Albert's botanical, conservation, tree plantation and regeneration work was strongly stimulated and  supported by the many talented members of the Field Naturalists Club, people such as Dr. William MacGillivray, his son Dr. Ian MacGillivray, Edmund Dow, Maurice Mawby and many others.&lt;ref&gt;Ardill 2017&lt;/ref&gt; Morris became widely recognised for his botanical expertise, tree plantation work and his propagation and contributions of plants to residents and civic bodies in Broken Hill, and for his firm belief in the possibility of re-establishing vegetation around the city.

===Botany, ecology, conservation, restoration===

 
While he trained and worked as an assayer at the Central Mine, it was as a botanist, ecologist and conservationist that Albert is best remembered and celebrated. His enduring legacy at Broken Hill is the 'green belt' of re-vegetation and regeneration around the city, now known as the "Broken Hill regeneration area", that he conceived and worked to establish. 

Morris achieved national and international recognition as an expert on arid zone Australian flora, and corresponded with many prominent Australian botanists. &lt;ref&gt;Jones 2016&lt;/ref&gt; He made a collection of about 8000 plant specimens, which was donated to the [[Waite Institute]] in South Australia in 1944. This collection is now predominantly held by the [[State Herbarium of South Australia]] with some specimens held by other state collections including the Royal Botanic Garden of NSW. &lt;ref&gt;CHAH 2016&lt;/ref&gt; He was noted for his generosity and hospitality to fellow naturalists and others working at Broken Hill. Among those he helped was the noted botanist and author [[Thistle Harris]], who worked in Broken Hill as a teacher c.1930. &lt;ref&gt;Ardill 2017&lt;/ref&gt;

By 1936 Albert Morris had acquired considerable expertise in the distinct fields of arid zone tree plantation establishment and arid zone natural regeneration. This expertise was based on the field knowledge that he had acquired on Barrier Field Naturalists Club outings into the surrounding countryside from 1920 onwards, his deep botanical knowledge of arid zone flora species and experience gained from the establishment of small tree plantations, containing flora species suited to the arid conditions,  in the city of Broken Hill (c.1930), particularly around the hospital.&lt;ref&gt;Ardill 2017&lt;/ref&gt; His own home nursery experiments with sand stabilising plants such as saltbush further enhanced his restoration knowledge.&lt;ref&gt;Morris, M. 1966; Ardill 2017&lt;/ref&gt; Broad acreage field trials conducted in 1935-36 on local pastoral stations that involved fencing to exclude stock and rabbits in order to facilitate natural regeneration of the indigenous flora convinced him of the efficacy of the natural regeneration method of degraded land restoration.&lt;ref&gt;Ardill 2017&lt;/ref&gt;

Albert was also possessed of extensive administrative and communication skills. His professional employment as an assayer involved responsible administrative duties, and he utilised this experience to good effect in his volunteer conservation work. As secretary of the Barrier Field Naturalists Club he corresponded with and lobbied New South Wales state government ministers and other representatives of industry and government bodies on conservation and restoration matters. 

In particular, in 1935, he wrote on behalf of the Barrier Field Naturalists to the New South Wales state government, urging the government to establish a fenced natural regeneration area around Broken Hill.&lt;ref&gt;Ardill 2017&lt;/ref&gt; In April 1936, on behalf of the Barrier Field Naturalists Club, Albert and other members presented detailed submissions on soil and flora conservation and restoration techniques to the New South Wales Erosion Committee.&lt;ref&gt;Ardill 2017&lt;/ref&gt; In May 1936 Albert and the Club commenced lobbying the state government to fence two water reservoir sites in Broken Hill, in order to exclude stock and rabbits and allow the indigenous flora there to naturally regenerate. Due to Albert's persistence this work was approved in September, 1937, and the fencing was done in April, 1939, shortly after his death.&lt;ref&gt;Ardill 2017&lt;/ref&gt;

===Tree plantations and regeneration reserves===
 

In 1936 the Zinc Corporation, another Broken Hill mining company, had developed extensive plans to construct a new mine complex on a bare, desert like piece of ground to the south-west of Broken Hill, and engaged the honorary services of Albert Morris to advise them on the establishment of tree plantations to protect the new mine works from sand-drift and the strong local westerly winds. Construction of these tree plantations, which were to be irrigated with waste water and established by traditional planting methods but using native Australian vegetation including saltbush, a method Morris had experimented with, commenced in May, 1936.&lt;ref&gt;Ardill 2017&lt;/ref&gt;

As anticipated by the knowledgeable Morris, the initial fencing of the proposed tree plantation areas facilitated rapid and substantial natural regeneration within the still unplanted and otherwise bare, fenced enclosures, of native grasses and [[forbs]] germinating from seed stored in the soil. &lt;ref&gt;Morris, A. 1938&lt;/ref&gt;.. Crucially, this regrowth of native vegetation persisted as a result of foraging livestock and rabbits having been excluded by the new fencing. Morris seized on this significant (approx. 22 acres) demonstration of natural regeneration principles and convinced the Zinc Corporation mine manager, A.J. Keast, to obtain the backing of senior Zinc Corp management and other mining companies in Broken Hill to undertake a new project, the trial fencing of regeneration reserves to the south-west of the city, reserves which would utilise ''natural regeneration'', and not ''planting'', as their primary method of re-vegetation.&lt;ref&gt;Morris, A. 1938; Ardill 2017&lt;/ref&gt; It is important to note that Morris had fully anticipated and predicted this natural regeneration within the tree plantation fenced areas; as mentioned he had already observed and confirmed this process in previous broad acreage field trials and was aware of the ways in which indigenous flora seed could be naturally stored in the soil, be dispersed by wind and germinate and thrive after relatively small amounts of rainfall.&lt;ref&gt;Ardill 2017&lt;/ref&gt; For the times, this was pioneering knowledge, and largely originated from Albert's detailed botanical studies of the local flora.

===The Broken Hill regeneration area: 1936-58===


Work on the tree plantations, which were located close to the Zinc Corporation mining, office and residential complex, continued, but Morris was now also managing, again in an honorary capacity, the new project, the construction of fenced regeneration reserves along the south-west perimeter of Broken Hill. This work, which ultimately comprised the first stage of the current Broken Hill regeneration area, commenced in the spring of 1936 and was completed in February, 1937.&lt;ref&gt;Ardill 2017&lt;/ref&gt; Further reserves were added between 1937 and 1939, so that the entire south and westward aspects of Broken Hill were protected from wind driven sand-drifts by naturally regenerated indigenous vegetation of the type that naturally occurred on the site.

Sadly, Albert Morris died in January, 1939, after several months of illness, but he did live to see substantial evidence of the success of his regeneration work. Indeed, the successful vegetation regeneration within the initial set of regeneration reserves was highly praised by the visiting South Australian Erosion Committee (June 1937) and by mid-1937 the Zinc Corporation, impressed with the vegetation regrowth within the first set of regeneration reserves, was planning the construction of new reserves to the north-west of the city, and this work was completed by early 1938. Albert was also aware that a Broken Hill community progress association had successfully obtained funds from the state government to finance the construction of a regeneration reserve to the south of the city in 1938-39.&lt;ref&gt;Ardill 2017&lt;/ref&gt; Unfortunately, Albert did not live to see the beneficial effect that the good rains of 1939 had on the reserves.   

The Second World War (1939-45) delayed the further development of more regeneration reserves. Margaret Morris was active in the botanical management and documentation of the reserves during this period and also successfully promoted them with newspaper articles and an article in the Australian Journal of Science.&lt;ref&gt;Ardill 2017; Morris, M. 1939&lt;/ref&gt; In her articles Margaret was unstinting in her generous acknowledgement of the contributions made by members of the Broken Hill community, the mining industry and Broken Hill Council. The Barrier Field Naturalists Club also continued its involvement with the reserves, with members conducting botanical surveys of the thriving natural flora. The Mine Managers Association of Broken Hill contributed generously to finance the upkeep of the regeneration reserves and Broken Hill Council managed this work.&lt;ref&gt;Ardill 2017&lt;/ref&gt;     

The citizens of Broken Hill suffered severely from the effects of the drought of 1940 and further prolonged dry periods in the early to mid-1940s, with enormous dust storms ravaging the city. With the completion of the Second World War and due to the success and popularity of the regeneration reserves, the city administration lobbied the New South Wales government to complete the encirclement of the city with further regeneration reserves, and these were constructed to the north and east of Broken Hill between 1950 and 1958.&lt;ref&gt;Ardill 2017&lt;/ref&gt; The regeneration reserves of 1936-58 now primarily comprise the current Broken Hill regeneration area, with minor adjustments having being made over the years.

===Re-vegetation techniques used===


It has in the past and still is very often mistakenly assumed that a ''planting'' technique was utilised to initially establish all of the regeneration reserves. It is correct that the Zinc Corporation tree plantations of 1936-37, separate and relatively small projects located immediately adjacent to the urban area and piped water resources, were irrigated and their vegetation was primarily established by the manual planting of thousands of trees, with saltbush also being planted. However it is clear from the documentation of the time that the regeneration reserves, as distinct from the tree plantations, utilised principles of natural regeneration, and not planting, to initiate re-vegetation, and also principles of what is today known as the contemporary restoration concept [[ecological restoration]].&lt;ref&gt;Morris, A. 1938; Ardill 2017; McDonald 2017a; McDonald 2017b&lt;/ref&gt; See also: http://seraustralasia.com and [[bush regeneration]]. 

Albert was interested in achieving broad acreage arid zone re-vegetation, both for amenity and conservation purposes, and it would have been impossible to achieve this, given the prevailing dry, hot and often drought stricken environment, by utilising a ''planting'' technique. To propagate, manually plant and keep hydrated until they were established the tens of thousands of trees, shrubs, grasses and forbs, spread over many hundreds of rugged hectares, necessary for such a project would have required enormous resources and funding; it is unlikely that such a project would even be feasible today. It was clearly his intention that the establishment of vegetation in the regeneration reserves was to be primarily left to the factors associated with natural regeneration: [[germination]] of existing, naturally deposited and wind dispersed seeds of the local flora and the regrowth of established but degraded in ground rootstocks, and the local rainfall of approximately 250mm per year.&lt;ref&gt;Morris, A. 1938&lt;/ref&gt; Crucially, fencing around the reserves excluded the livestock and rabbits that had previously decimated this indigenous flora. Spreading of seed by hand and the ploughing of moisture impermeable claypans (aka scalds) were techniques also contemplated by Morris.&lt;ref&gt;Morris, A. 1938&lt;/ref&gt; Relatively little or no tree or shrub planting was done in order to establish the regeneration reserves, except in an undefined section of regeneration reserve no. 2, which was also irrigated as this reserve was adjacent to the small and irrigated tree plantation no. 1, now known as Albert Morris Park.&lt;ref&gt;Ardill 2017&lt;/ref&gt; Some planting was carried out by community members along water courses and in claypans and extensive tree planting was carried out along some road verges from approximately 1939 onwards.&lt;ref&gt;Morris, M. 1939&lt;/ref&gt;

==Remembrance and celebration==

The regeneration area still encircles Broken Hill today, providing the city with an attractive ring of natural vegetation. It is managed by Broken Hill City Council with the support of [[Landcare in Australia|Landcare]] Broken Hill and members of the Barrier Field Naturalists Club. The regeneration reserves were recognised as cultural heritage items by the New South Wales National Trust in 1991.&lt;ref&gt;Jones 2016&lt;/ref&gt; In 2015 the City of Broken Hill was declared a place of national heritage values by the Australian government. As part of this recognition, Albert's achievements and the Broken Hill regeneration reserves were listed as heritage values of the city.&lt;ref&gt;Jones 2016&lt;/ref&gt;  

The work of Albert Morris was valued and commemorated by the citizens of Broken Hill. In 1941 a water fountain dedicated to his memory and funded by public subscription, was installed outside the Technical College, Argent Street, Broken Hill. In 1944 Margaret Morris opened the Albert Morris Memorial Gates, which are now located in Wentworth Road, Broken Hill. The John Scougall Gates, named after Jack Scougall, a foreman of works on the regeneration reserves and later manager of the Zinc Corporation nursery, stand nearby.   

A consortium of Australian ecological restoration organisations initiated the Albert Morris Award for an Outstanding Ecological Restoration Project in 2017 to mark the eighty year anniversary of the completion of the first regeneration reserves in 1937. In August, 2017, the Australian Association of Bush Regenerators, Broken Hill City Council, The Barrier Field Naturalists Club, Landcare Broken Hill and Broken Hill Art Exchange came together with many visitors and local residents in Broken Hill to mark this event with a field trip and inaugural Albert Morris Ecological Restoration Award dinner.  The Award dinner recognised the skills, dedication and community spirit of Albert Morris, Margaret Morris and their many colleagues in the Barrier Field Naturalists Club, the contributions of Broken Hill citizens and community members, and the contributions of the mining industry of Broken Hill, Broken Hill City Council and the New South Wales state government, to the regeneration area project.&lt;ref&gt;McDonald, M. 2017 &lt;/ref&gt; At the Award dinner the inaugural Albert Morris Award for an Outstanding Ecological Restoration Project was presented "to the Broken Hill Regeneration Reserves Project itself and all those who made it happen from 1936-1958 and those who are still making it happen". &lt;ref&gt;Ardill &amp; Brodie 2018&lt;/ref&gt; The actual award is a sculpture by Badger Bates, a distinguished Broken Hill artist and member of the Paakantji People of the Darling River, western NSW. The sculpture is titled 'Regeneration’ and is made from the wattle "Dead Finish", ''Acacia tetragonophylla''. &lt;ref&gt;AABR News October 2017; Ardill &amp; Brodie 2018&lt;/ref&gt; 
 
== The South Australian work of Albert Morris ==

In 1932 [[Essington Lewis]], famed manager of the Australian industrial and mining corporation, Broken Hill Proprietary Company ([[BHP]]), invited Albert Morris to visit South Australia and investigate the possibility of establishing tree plantations at the companies' corporate towns of [[Whyalla]] and [[Iron Knob]], for amenity purposes. During a series of visits between 1932 and 1937 Morris (the historical documentation does not record participation by Margaret Morris in the S.A. projects) successfully established an Australian flora plant nursery in Whyalla and developed plantations of Australian flora there and at Iron Knob. He also advised the municipal council of [[Port Pirie]] on the possibility of establishing plantations there, although no actual work appears to have been undertaken.&lt;ref&gt;Ardill 2018&lt;/ref&gt;  

Morris initiated two natural regeneration projects in Whyalla, most likely between 1935 and 1937. At Hummock Hill, fencing of the bare site to exclude dairy cattle led to the regeneration of the indigenous flora. The second project was located on the current site of the Ada Ryan Gardens in Whyalla, and involved the management of invasive beach sand dunes by fencing to exclude rabbits and cattle, allowing the indigenous flora to recover. By 1939 both projects were being hailed as major successes with tangible outcomes. &lt;ref&gt;Ardill 2018&lt;/ref&gt;

'''The Arizona Geographic Information Council''' ('''AGIC''') was established by executive order as [[Arizona]]'s primary forum and oversight group for coordination efforts related to [[geographic information systems]] (GIS). AGIC identifies standards and implementation strategies to provide a framework for optimizing [[Arizona]]'s investment in GIS. Through cooperation and partnerships, AGIC facilitates the acquisition, exchange and management of geospatial data and technology to benefit State agencies and the Arizona GIS community. AGIC meets on a regular basis and conducts an Annual GIS Conference to address statewide GIS issues, requirements and solutions.&lt;ref name="About AGIC"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://agic.az.gov/about|title=About AGIC|author=AGIC|publisher=State of Arizona|accessdate=2007-11-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Symposium Conference ==
AGIC hosts an annual training symposium bringing together GIS professionals statewide to share their best practices.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.agicsymposium.org/&lt;/ref&gt;

== Data Sharing ==
"The AZGEO Clearinghouse is an initiative of the Arizona Geographic Information Council. AZGEO is designed to provide GIS users with links to Internet map services, FGDC compliant metadata, and geospatial data downloads. Data include GIS layers for administrative boundaries, demographic, environmental factors, hydrology, imagery, indices, mining, natural features, transportation and more."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=AZ Geo Clearinghouse|url=https://azgeo.az.gov/azgeo/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Organization ==

[[File:Steinerne Rinne HQ.jpg|thumb|The ''[[Steinerne Rinne (Kaiser)|Steinerne Rinne]]'' couloir from the north with the peaks of [[Predigtstuhl (Kaiser)|Predigtstuhl]] (l) and [[Fleischbank]] (r) in the [[Austria]]n [[Kaiser Mountains]]]]

A '''''couloir''''' ({{IPA-fr|ku.lwaʁ|lang}}, "passage" or "corridor"), is a narrow [[gully]] with a steep gradient in a mountainous terrain.&lt;ref&gt;Whittow, John (1984). ''Dictionary of Physical Geography''. London: Penguin, p. 121. {{ISBN|0-14-051094-X}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Geology==
A couloir may be a seam, scar, or fissure, or vertical [[crevasse]] in an otherwise solid mountain mass. Though often hemmed in by sheer cliff walls, couloirs may also be less well-defined, and often simply a line of broken talus or [[scree]] ascending the mountainside and bordered by trees or other natural features. Couloirs are especially significant in winter months when they may be filled in with snow or ice, and become much more noticeable than in warmer months when most of the snow and ice may recede. These physical features make the use of couloirs popular for both [[mountaineering]] and [[skiing]].

==Winter Sports==
While in the [[United States]] such terrain features are uncommon at [[ski resort]]s, in [[Europe]] they are more common. Couloirs are frequently considered an [[off-piste]] trail and, as such, are not marked on ski [[piste]] maps. Some exceptions to this include: 
*The ''Grand Couloir'' in [[Courchevel]], [[France]], which has historically variable classifications but is now graded as a [[Piste#Ratings|black]] run under French piste difficulty grading
* The ''Massif du [[Mont Blanc]]'', which has many well-known, celebrated, and frequently visited couloirs
*''Gervasutti Couloir''
*''Breche Nonne Couloir''
*''Chevalier Couloir''
* ''Cosmiques couloirs'' 
* [[Jackson Hole Mountain Resort]]'s [[Corbet's Couloir]]
* [[Sugar Bowl Ski Resort]] in California's run called "Nancy's Couloir"
* [[Big Sky Resort]] in Montana's
**"Big Couloir" run, which at a 50 degree pitch for over 1,000 feet of vertical is one of the most intense in-bounds trails in America
**Little Couloir, a lesser-known run located just to the side of Big Couloir, which has an even steeper pitch between 55 and 60 degrees, with the entry about 59 degrees.  
*The [[double black diamond]]  run on Blackcomb Mountain in Whistler, British Columbia, Canada, called "Couloir Extreme", which is located inside the [[Whistler-Blackcomb]] resort boundaries and can be accessed via chairlift
* The [[Norton Couloir]], on the north face of [[Mount Everest]], was descended by snowboard for the first time by French snowboarder [[Marco Siffredi]] in 2001.

In 2005, Digital Envoy created two business units: [[Digital Element]] and Digital Resolve. In 2007, [[Landmark Communications]], Inc. purchased Digital Envoy. The company became part of Dominion Enterprises in 2009.

Digital Envoy, through its [[Digital Element]] business unit, is often considered to be the main supplier of IP targeting technology to the [[online advertising]] industry.  According to AdOps Insider, "practically speaking, most of the advertising industry relies on a small company called Digital Envoy" for IP address geolocation of advertisements.&lt;ref name=wants&gt;[http://runofnetwork.adzerk.com/adops/making-sense-of-geotargeting/ “Making Sense of Geotargeting, December 15, 2011]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''East Helsinki''' ({{lang-fi|Itä-Helsinki}}, {{lang-sv|Östra Helsingfors}}) is an area in [[Helsinki]], [[Finland]], usually thought to comprise the city's eastern and south-eastern major districts ({{Lang-fi|suurpiiri}}, {{Lang-sv|stordistrikt}}), including the districts of [[Vartiokylä]], [[Myllypuro]], [[Mellunkylä]], [[Vuosaari]], [[Herttoniemi]], [[Laajasalo]] and [[Kulosaari]]. With the exception of Kulosaari, the buildings in the area are relatively new – most have been built in the 1960s or later – and constitute relatively densely inhabited suburbs, except for the southern part of Laajasalo and most of Kulosaari.

East Helsinki has had problems with unemployment and poverty, and [[immigration|immigrants]] and [[refugee]]s are somewhat concentrated in the area's [[subsidised housing]] and city-owned apartments. This has led to a popular conception of East Helsinki as a problem-ridden area, which is not necessarily true{{Citation needed|date=March 2018}}.

Public transport in East Helsinki is organised mainly through the [[Helsinki Metro]], most of whose stops are located in the area, and feeder bus lines. Scandinavia's largest [[shopping centre]], ''[[Itis shopping centre|Itis]]'', is located near the geographical centre of East Helsinki, and many public and commercial services for the area are concentrated there.

A major change will take place in the area's infrastructure upon the completion of the [[Port of Vuosaari]]. Most of the existing port facilities in Helsinki will be moved to the new seaport, which will create increased economic activity in East Helsinki as well as release new areas for development in other parts of the city.

== Demographics ==
{{As of|2005}}, the eastern and south-eastern major districts of Helsinki have a combined population of 145,321, the largest single district being [[Mellunkylä]] with a population of 36,360. 10.2% of the major districts' population is of foreign origin, which is more than anywhere else in Helsinki. 84.9% of the population of East Helsinki speak [[Finnish language|Finnish]] as their native language. 5.4% speak [[Finland-Swedish|Swedish]], while 9.7% have another language as their mother tongue.&lt;ref name=alue&gt;Helsingin kaupungin tietokeskus, ''[http://www.hel2.fi/tietokeskus/julkaisut/pdf/06_01_20_AlueittainJulkaisu.pdf Helsinki alueittain 2005]''.&lt;/ref&gt; The most common languages after Finnish and Swedish are [[Russian language|Russian]], [[Estonian language|Estonian]], [[Somali language|Somali]] and [[English language|English]].&lt;ref&gt;Helsingin kaupungin tietokeskus, ''[http://www.hel2.fi/tietokeskus/julkaisut/pdf/05_09_23_ranto_vj34.pdf Ulkomaalaiset Helsingissä]''.&lt;/ref&gt;

The eastern major district has an [[unemployment rate]] of about 12%, more than any other major district in Helsinki, while the south-eastern major district's rate was closer to average at about 9%. Approximately one out of every ten people in East Helsinki receives [[social welfare]] payments from the Finnish state. In Mellunkylä, where the situation is the most problematic, the figure is 14.9%. (For comparison, the figure for [[Lauttasaari]] in [[West Helsinki]] is only 3.8%.)&lt;ref name=alue/&gt;

== East Helsinki in popular culture ==
Many [[Finnish hip hop]] artists and groups, such as [[Iso H]], [[Steen1]] and [[Asa (rapper)|Asa]], come from East Helsinki. Some of them, especially Asa, employ very political themes in their music, focusing on the problems of the Finnish capital's eastern suburbs.{{According to whom|date=December 2017}}

The [[Roihuvuori water tower]], built in the 1970s, which is visible from most parts of East Helsinki, has become somewhat of a symbol for the area. It is used as a common device in Finnish films and TV series to signify that the events are set in East Helsinki.{{According to whom|date=December 2017}}

[[File:Eastern Georgia.PNG|210px|thumb|Map outlining the territory of Eastern Georgia]]

'''Eastern Georgia''' ({{lang-ka|აღმოსავლეთ საქართველო}}, ''aghmosavlet' sak'art'velo'') is a geographic area encompassing the territory of the [[Caucasus|Caucasian]] nation of [[Georgia (country)|Georgia]] to the east and south of the [[Likhi Range|Likhi]] and [[Meskheti Range|Meskheti]] Ranges, but excluding the [[Black Sea]] region of [[Adjara]]. 

Eastern Georgia includes the historic Georgian provinces of [[Samtskhe]], [[Javakheti]], [[Kartli]] with the national capital city of [[Tbilisi]], [[Kakheti]], [[Pshavi]], [[Mtiuleti]], [[Tusheti]], [[Khevsureti]], and [[Khevi]]. Current administrative regions ([[mkhare]]) of eastern Georgia are: [[Samtskhe-Javakheti]], [[Shida Kartli]], [[Kvemo Kartli]], the city of Tbilisi, [[Mtskheta-Mtianeti]], and [[Kakheti]].

The regions of [[Kartli]] and [[Kakheti]], had been under Iranian [[suzerainty]] since 1555 following the [[Peace of Amasya]] signed with neighbouring rivalling Ottoman Turkey. With the death of [[Nader Shah]] in 1747, both kingdoms broke free of Iranian control and were reunified through [[Kingdom of Kartli-Kakheti|a personal union]] under the energetic king [[Heraclius II of Georgia|Heraclius (Erekle) II]] in 1762. Erekle, who had risen to prominence through the Iranian ranks, was awarded the crown of Kartli by Nader himself in 1744 for his loyal service to him.&lt;ref&gt;Ronald Grigor Suny.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="17408">'''Ecocriticism''' is the study of [[literature]] and the [[environment (biophysical)|environment]] from an [[interdisciplinary]] point of view, where literature scholars analyze texts that illustrate environmental concerns and examine the various ways literature treats the subject of [[nature]]. Some ecocritics brainstorm possible solutions for the correction of the contemporary environmental situation, though not all ecocritics agree on the purpose, methodology, or scope of ecocriticism. 
In the United States, ecocriticism is often associated with the [[Association for the Study of Literature and Environment]] (ASLE),&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;Glotfelty &amp; Fromm 1996, p. xviii&lt;/ref&gt; which hosts biennial meetings for scholars who deal with environmental matters in literature.  ASLE publishes a journal&amp;mdash;''Interdisciplinary Studies in Literature and Environment'' (''ISLE'')&amp;mdash;in which current international scholarship can be found.

Ecocriticism is an intentionally broad approach that is known by a number of other designations, including "green (cultural) studies", "[[Ecopoetry|ecopoetics]]", and "environmental literary criticism" and is often informed by other fields such as [[ecology]], [[sustainable design]], [[biopolitics]], [[environmental history]], [[environmentalism]], and [[Social ecology (theory)|social ecology]], among others.

== Definition ==
In comparison with other 'political' forms of criticism, there has been relatively little dispute about the moral and philosophical aims of ecocriticism, although its scope has broadened rapidly from nature writing, romantic poetry, and canonical literature to take in film, television, theatre, animal stories, architectures, scientific narratives and an extraordinary range of literary texts. At the same time, ecocriticism has borrowed methodologies and theoretically informed approaches liberally from other fields of literary, social and scientific study.

Cheryll Glotfelty's working definition in ''The Ecocriticism Reader'' is that "ecocriticism is the study of the relationship between literature and the physical environment",&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt; and one of the implicit goals of the approach is to recoup professional dignity for what Glotfelty calls the "undervalued genre of nature writing".&lt;ref&gt;Glotfelty &amp; Fromm 1996, p. xxxi&lt;/ref&gt; Lawrence Buell defines "'ecocriticism' ... as [a] study of the relationship between literature and the environment conducted in a spirit of commitment to environmentalist praxis".&lt;ref&gt;430, n.20&lt;/ref&gt;

Simon Estok noted in 2001 that "ecocriticism has distinguished itself, debates notwithstanding, firstly by the ethical stand it takes, its commitment to the natural world as an important thing rather than simply as an object of thematic study, and, secondly, by its commitment to making connections".&lt;ref&gt;Estok 2001, p. 220&lt;/ref&gt;

More recently, in an article that extends ecocriticism to Shakespearean studies, Estok argues that ecocriticism is more than "simply the study of Nature or natural things in literature; rather, it is any theory that is committed to effecting change by analyzing the function–thematic, artistic, social, historical, ideological, theoretical, or otherwise–of the natural environment, or aspects of it, represented in documents (literary or other) that contribute to material practices in material worlds".&lt;ref&gt;Estok 2005, pp. 16-17&lt;/ref&gt; This echoes the functional approach of the [[cultural ecology]] branch of ecocriticism, which analyzes the analogies between ecosystems and imaginative texts and posits that such texts potentially have an ecological (regenerative, revitalizing) function in the cultural system.&lt;ref&gt;Zapf 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

As Michael P. Cohen has observed, "if you want to be an ecocritic, be prepared to explain what you do and be criticized, if not satirized."   Certainly, Cohen adds his voice to such critique, noting that one of the problems of ecocriticism has been what he calls its "praise-song school" of criticism. All ecocritics share an environmentalist motivation of some sort, but whereas the majority are 'nature endorsing',&lt;ref&gt;[[Kate Soper]], "What is Nature?", 1998&lt;/ref&gt; some are 'nature sceptical'. In part this entails a shared sense of the ways in which 'nature' has been used to legitimise gender, sexual and racial norms (so homosexuality has been seen as 'unnatural', for example), but it also involves scepticism about the uses to which 'ecological' language is put in ecocriticism; it can also involve a critique of the ways cultural norms of nature and the environment contribute to environmental degradation. Greg Garrard has dubbed 'pastoral ecology' the notion that nature undisturbed is balanced and harmonious,&lt;ref&gt;Barry 2009, pp. 56-58&lt;/ref&gt; while Dana Phillips has criticised the literary quality and scientific accuracy of nature writing in "The Truth of Ecology". Similarly, there has been a call to recognize the place of the [[Environmental Justice]] movement in redefining ecocritical discourse.&lt;ref&gt;Buell 1998&lt;/ref&gt;

In response to the question of what ecocriticism is or should be, Camilo Gomides has offered an operational definition that is both broad and discriminating: "The field of enquiry that analyzes and promotes works of art which raise moral questions about human interactions with nature, while also motivating audiences to live within a limit that will be binding over generations" (16). He tests it for a film (mal)adaptation about Amazonian deforestation. Implementing the Gomides definition, Joseph Henry Vogel makes the case that ecocriticism constitutes an "economic school of thought" as it engages audiences to debate issues of resource allocation that have no technical solution. Ashton Nichols has recently argued that the historical dangers of a romantic version of nature now need to be replaced by "urbanatural roosting", a view that sees urban life and the natural world as closely linked and argues for humans to live more lightly on the planet, the way virtually all other species do.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://us.macmillan.com/beyondromanticecocriticism-1/AshtonNichols|title=Macmillan|first=|last=Macmillan|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==In literary studies==
Ecocritics investigate such things as the underlying [[ecology|ecological]] values, what, precisely, is meant by the word nature, and whether the examination of "place" should be a distinctive category, much like class, gender or race. Ecocritics examine human perception of [[wilderness]], and how it has changed throughout history and whether or not current environmental issues are accurately represented or even mentioned in popular culture and modern literature. Scholars in ecocriticism engage in questions regarding [[anthropocentrism]], and the "mainstream assumption that the natural world be seen primarily as a resource for human beings" as well as critical approaches to changing ideas in "the material and cultural bases of modern society".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Clark|first1=Timothy|title=The Cambridge Introduction to Literature and the Environment|date=2011|publisher=Cambridge UP|location=New York|isbn=9780521720908|page=2}}&lt;!--|accessdate=May 19, 2015--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Other disciplines, such as history, economics, philosophy, ethics, and psychology, are also considered by ecocritics to be possible contributors to ecocriticism.

While William Rueckert may have been the first person to use the term ''ecocriticism'' (Barry 240) in his 1978 essay entitled ''Literature and Ecology: An Experiment in Ecocriticism,'' ecocriticism as a movement owes much to [[Rachel Carson]]'s 1962 environmental exposé ''[[Silent Spring]]''. Drawing from this critical moment, Rueckert's intent was to focus on "the application of ecology and ecological concepts to the study of literature".&lt;ref&gt;Glotfelty &amp; Fromm 1996, p.&amp;nbsp;107&lt;/ref&gt;

Ecologically minded individuals and scholars have been publishing progressive works of ecotheory and criticism since the explosion of environmentalism in the late 1960s and 1970s. However, because there was no organized movement to study the ecological/environmental side of literature, these important works were scattered and categorized under a litany of different subject headings: [[pastoral]]ism, human ecology, regionalism, American Studies etc. British [[marxist literary criticism|marxist critic]] [[Raymond Williams]], for example, wrote a seminal critique of pastoral literature in 1973, ''[[The Country and the City]]''.

Another early ecocritical text, Joseph Meeker's ''The Comedy of Survival'' (1974), proposed a version of an argument that was later to dominate ecocriticism and environmental philosophy; that environmental crisis is caused primarily by a cultural tradition in the West of separation of culture from nature, and elevation of the former to moral predominance. Such [[anthropocentrism]] is identified in the tragic conception of a hero whose moral struggles are more important than mere biological survival, whereas the science of animal ethology, Meeker asserts, shows that a "comic mode" of muddling through and "making love not war" has superior ecological value. In the later, "second wave" ecocriticism, Meeker's adoption of an ecophilosophical position with apparent scientific sanction as a measure of literary value tended to prevail over Williams's ideological and historical critique of the shifts in a literary genre's representation of nature.

As Glotfelty noted in ''The Ecocriticism Reader'', "One indication of the disunity of the early efforts is that these critics rarely cited one another's work; they didn't know that it existed...Each was a single voice howling in the wilderness."&lt;ref&gt;Glotfelty &amp; Fromm 1996, p. vii&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless, ecocriticism—unlike feminist and Marxist criticisms—failed to crystallize into a coherent movement in the late 1970s, and indeed only did so in the USA in the 1990s.{{Citation needed|date=February 2016}}

In the mid-1980s, scholars began to work collectively to establish ecocritism as a genre, primarily through the work of the [[Western Literature Association]] in which the revaluation of nature writing as a non-fictional literary genre could function. In 1990, at the [[University of Nevada, Reno]], Glotfelty became the first person to hold an academic position as a professor of Literature and the Environment, and UNR has retained the position it established at that time as the intellectual home of ecocriticism even as ASLE has burgeoned into an organization with thousands of members in the US alone. From the late 1990s, new branches of ASLE and affiliated organizations were started in the UK, Japan, Korea, Australia and New Zealand (ASLEC-ANZ), India (OSLE-India), Taiwan, Canada and Europe.

==Alcorn Ranch==

By the fall of 1864, a man named Alcorn, from Kentucky and his wife from South Carolina, had started a ranch at Fork of the Road. From November 13, 1864, following an Indian attack on settlers along the Mojave River the Alcorn Ranch was the gathering place for defense of the settler families along the river between [[Point of Rocks (California)|Point of Rocks]] and [[Camp Cady]].  Mrs. Jane Rousseau who traveled with her husband, a doctor, in a wagon train from Salt Lake City to Southern California in late 1864, wrote that Alcorn had supplied them with feed for their horses when they had run out of it at [[Bitter Spring (San Bernardino County)|Bitter Spring]].  They stopped at the Alcorn Ranch and her husband treated "a young man about to die, a son of Mr. Allcorn....", before moving on up the Mojave River.&lt;ref&gt;Richard D. and Kathryn L.

Many '''forts and fortifications''' have been built to protect the '''[[Isle of Wight]]''' (South England) from foreign invasion. Throughout history the island has been a site of key military importance. Controlling both entrances to the [[Solent]] and the home of the [[Royal Navy]], [[Portsmouth]]. This is a list of most of the fortifications on the island.

== Palmerston Forts ==
{{main|Palmerston Forts, Isle of Wight}}
The Palmerston Forts are forts built during the Victorian era. The name comes from their association with [[Lord Palmerston]], who was the Prime Minister of the time and promoted the idea.

The structures were built as a response to a perceived threat of a French invasion.

The defences on the [[Isle of Wight]] were built to protect the approaches to the [[Solent]], [[Southampton]] and [[Portsmouth]]. There are three groups, those at the west end of the island, those at the east end, and four in the Solent.

The information is taken from documents for each of the sites, courtesy of the Victorian Forts website.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Victorian Forts|url= http://www.victorianforts.co.uk|publisher=Victorian Forts website}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Bembridge Fort ==
{{main|Bembridge Fort}}
Built on [[Bembridge Down]] it is one of the [[Palmerston Forts]] built to protect against perceived French invasion threats.

== Cliff End Battery ==
[[File:12andahalf_inch_muzzle_loading_rifled_gun_(1875).jpg|thumb|right|A 12.5 inch gun from Cliff End Battery]]
{{main|Cliff End Battery}}
Built on the west coast of the Island it is one of the Palmerston Forts built to protect against perceived French invasion threats.

== Fort Albert ==
{{main|Fort Albert}}
Fort Albert was built in 1856 on an artificial island to defend the western approaches to Portsmouth. It was intended to house 29 guns in four tiers, it was one of the last gun-towers built in England.

== Fort Victoria ==
{{main|Fort Victoria (Isle of Wight)}}
Fort Victoria was a battery with barracks built west of [[Yarmouth, Isle of Wight|Yarmouth]] in the 1850s, it was later used as a [[submarine]] mining centre and military training area.

The  barrack blocks were demolished in 1969, but the casemates were not, and this is all that remains of the Fort.
The fort can now be visited in its role as a country park.

== Freshwater Redoubt ==
[[Freshwater Redoubt]] (or Fort Redoubt) Was built on the west coast of the Island at [[Freshwater bay]] as one of the Palmerston Forts built to protect against perceived French invasion threats.

== Nodes Point Battery ==
{{main|Nodes Point Battery}}
Built on the east of the Island at Nodes Point it is one of the Palmerston Forts built to protect against perceived French invasion threats.

== Puckpool Battery ==
[[File:Puckpool Battery 3.JPG|thumb|A part of Puckpool Battery]]
{{main|Puckpool Battery}}
Built at Puckpool point in the east it is one of the Palmerston Forts built to protect against perceived French invasion threats.

== Redcliff Battery ==
[[Redcliff Battery]] is a battery located west of Culver Cliffs and east of [[Yaverland]]. It is one of the many Palmerston Forts built to protect against perceived French invasion threats.

== Sandown Battery ==
[[Sandown Barrack Battery]] is a battery located in [[Sandown Bay]]. A Palmerston Fort built on the island to protect against perceived French invasion threats.

== Sandown Castle ==
{{main|Sandown Castle, Isle of Wight}}
Sandown Castle was one of Henry VIII's Device Forts. The [[Device Forts]] (Henrician Castles) were built as a network of coastal defences to defend against the French and Spanish after his break from the Roman Catholic Church. Although Sandown Castle was never attacked, it was the scene of a battle with French invaders. The French were repulsed.

== Sandown Fort ==
Built at Sandown in the east it is one of the Palmerston Forts built to protect against perceived French invasion threats.

== Steynewood Battery ==
Built in the east it is one of the Palmerston Forts built to protect against perceived French invasion threats.

== Warden Point Battery ==
Warden Point Battery is a battery on the Isle of Wight begun in 1862, that was originally armed with 7-inch and 9-inch rifled muzzle loaders on barbette mountings.
In use until 1936.

== Yarmouth Castle ==
Yarmouth Castle is a small off-square blockhouse built by Henry VIII in 1547, to guard Yarmouth, Isle of Wight harbour. It was built as part of Henry's second device programme to fortify the English coast with a chain of coastal defences known as Device Forts or Henrician Castles. These were built to guard against the threat of foreign invasion. As it is a later fortification it did not have the earlier rounded or concentric shape but a square [[keep]] with angular bastions. It is now owned by English Heritage.

== Yaverland Battery ==
Built in the east at Yaverland it is one of the Palmerston Forts built to protect against perceived French invasion threats. During the Second World War it was used by the Home Guard.

[[File:Cuba and the Bahamas.ogv|thumb|300px|This short video shows clouds over the island of Cuba and The Bahamas as the [[International Space Station|ISS]] flies from the [[Caribbean Sea]] north-east to the [[Atlantic Ocean]]. In the video, you can see Cuba is mostly covered by clouds, but the reefs in the Bahamas stand out quite nicely.]]

'''[[The Bahamas]]''' are a group of about 700 [[island]]s and [[cay]]s in the western [[Atlantic Ocean]], of which only between 30 and 40 are inhabited. The largest of the islands is [[Andros Island]], located north of [[Cuba]] and {{convert|200|km|abbr=off}} southeast of [[Florida]]. The [[Bimini]] islands are to its northwest. To the North is the island of [[Grand Bahama]], home to the second-largest city in the country, [[Freeport, Bahamas|Freeport]]. The island of [[Great Abaco]] is to its east. In the far south is the island of [[Great Inagua]], the second-largest island in the country. Other notable islands include [[Eleuthera]], [[Cat Island (Bahamas)|Cat Island]], [[San Salvador Island]], [[Acklins]], [[Crooked Island (Bahamas)|Crooked Island]], and [[Mayaguana]]. [[Nassau, Bahamas|Nassau]] is the capital and largest city, located on [[New Providence]]. The islands have a tropical climate, moderated by the [[Gulf Stream]].

The islands are surface projections of the three oceanic [[Bahama Banks]] - the Little Bahama Bank, the Great Bahama Bank, and the westernmost [[Cay Sal Bank]]. The highest point is only {{convert|63|m|abbr=off}} above sea level on Cat Island; the island of New Providence, where the capital city of Nassau is located, reaches a maximum elevation of only thirty-seven meters. The land on the Bahamas has a foundation of fossil [[coral]], but much of the rock is [[Oolite|oolitic]] [[limestone]]; the stone is derived from the disintegration of [[coral reef]]s and seashells. The land is primarily either rocky or [[mangrove]] [[swamp]]. Low scrub covers much of the surface area. [[Bahamian pineyards|Pineyards]] are found on four of the northern islands: Grand Bahama, Great Abaco, New Providence, and Andros. On some of the southern islands, low-growing tropical hardwood flourishes. Although some soil is very fertile, it is also very thin. Only a few freshwater lakes and just one river, located on Andros Island, are found in the Bahamas.

==Climate==
{{Wettest tropical cyclones in the Bahamas}}
The climate of the Bahama islands is [[tropical savanna]], with two seasons, a hot and wet summer (wet season) and dry winter (dry season).  

During the wet season, which extends from May through October, the climate is dominated by warm, moist tropical air masses as the [[Bermuda High]] brings a southeasterly flow from the deep tropics. Daily high temperatures are in the {{convert|31|°C|1}}range, with a dew point temperatures in the 75 - 77 F range, creating the typical hot and sultry island weather. Brief, but intense thundershowers are common with thunder and lighting. In the wet season, tropical storms and weak tropical lows may also contribute to seasonal rainfall. 

In dry season, extending from November through April, the subtropical high retreats, and a mix of drier northeast trade winds and occasional westerlies coming down from the North American mainland impact the Bahamas. Sunny, arid conditions prevail in the Bahamas in the dry season, and at times drought conditions can impact farming and agriculture. High temperatures during the dry season are in the {{convert|25|°C|1}} range. 

Annual rainfall averages {{convert|1400|mm}} and is usually concentrated in the August–October periods. Rainfall often occurs in short-lived, fairly intense, but brief thundershowers accompanied by strong gusty winds, followed by a return the intense sunshine and breezy conditions. 

Winds are predominantly easterly throughout the year but tend to become northeasterly from October to April and southeasterly from May to September. These winds seldom exceed twenty-four kilometres per hour except during hurricane season. Although the hurricane season officially lasts from June to November, most hurricanes in the Bahamas occur between July and October.  Before a long lull in activity which ended in the 1990s, the last one to strike was [[Hurricane David]] in September 1979. Damage was estimated at US$1.8 million and mainly affected agricultural products. The most intense twentieth-century hurricane to strike the Bahamas was the [[1929 Bahamas hurricane]]; winds of up to {{convert|230|km/h}} were recorded. Many lives were lost, and there was extensive damage to buildings, homes, and boats.

==Geologic Summary==
*[[Troodos Massif]]: The world's most heavily studied [[ophiolite]], in the south and center of Northern Cyprus. Lower units include [[harzburgite]] interpreted as deformed mantle, overlain by massive [[gabbro]], with [[dunite]] bodies left from mantle diapirs. It also includes [[trondjemite]] bodies, plagio-granite, [[chromite]] and dikes metamorphosed to [[zeolite]] and [[greenschist]] grade. These are covered by layers of extrusive rocks with sulfide mineralization and bounded by a fault lineament to the south. Pillow lavas are overlain by [[Mesozoic]] [[chert]] and volcaniclastic rocks as well as [[Cenozoic]] carbonates.
*Kyrenia Range: The range includes the oldest rocks in the region, in the form of [[Permian]] black shales. Shallow-water [[Paleogene]] [[olistrosomes]] and the Kantara Limestone are also important units. An active margin in the [[Quaternary]] drove uplift of the range, which had previously accumulated carbonates and [[turbidite]].

A '''high water mark''' is a point that represents the maximum rise of a body of water over land. Such a mark is often the result of a [[flood]], but high water marks may reflect an all-time high, an annual high (highest level to which water rose that year) or the high point for some other division of time. Knowledge of the high water mark for an area is useful in managing the development of that area, particularly in making preparations for flood surges.&lt;ref&gt;J. Curtis Weaver and Thomas J. Zembrzuski, Jr., "August 31, 1993, Storm Surge and Flood of Hurricane Emily on Hatteras Island, North Carolina", in Charles A. Perry, L. J. Combs, ''Summary of floods in the United States, January 1992 through September 1993'' (1995), U.S. Geological Survey Water-Supply Paper 2499, p. 260, stating: Documentation of notable coastal floods provides scientists and flood-plain managers with useful data and technical information for an improved understanding of the hazard and for improved management of flood-prone areas. Of particular importance is documentation of the duration of flooding (and rates of rise and recession of floodwaters), maximum flood elevations and depths, and delineation of the extent of storm-surge flooding.&lt;/ref&gt; High water marks from floods have been measured for planning purposes since at least as far back as the civilizations of ancient [[Egypt]].&lt;ref&gt;Daniel Kahneman, ''Thinking, Fast and Slow'' (2011), p. 137.&lt;/ref&gt; It is a common practice to create a physical marker indicating one or more of the highest water marks for an area, usually with a line at the level to which the water rose, and a notation of the date on which this high water mark was set. This may be a free-standing flood level [[Information sign|sign]] or other marker, or it may be affixed to a building or other structure that was standing at the time of the flood that set the mark.&lt;ref&gt;Nancy McTigue, James M. Symons, ''The Water Dictionary: A Comprehensive Reference of Water Terminology'' (2011), p. 284.&lt;/ref&gt;

A high water mark is not necessarily an actual physical mark,&lt;ref&gt;Bruce S. Flushman, ''Water Boundaries: Demystifying Land Boundaries Adjacent to Tidal Or Navigable Waters'' (2001), p. 73.&lt;/ref&gt; but it is possible for water rising to a high point to leave a lasting physical impression such as floodwater staining. A landscape marking left by the high water mark of ordinary tidal action may be called a '''strandline''' and is typically composed of debris left by high tide. The area at the top of a [[beach]] where [[marine debris|debris]] is deposited is an example of this phenomenon. Where there are [[tide]]s, this line is formed by the highest position of the tide, and moves up and down the beach on a [[Tide#Analysis|fortnightly cycle]].&lt;ref name="Durham"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.durhambiodiversity.org.uk/pdfs/habitats/Strandline.pdf |publisher=Durham Biodiversity Partnership |title=Strandline}}&lt;/ref&gt; The debris is chiefly composed of [[decomposition|rotting]] [[seaweed]], but can also include a large amount of [[litter]], either from [[ship]]s at sea or from [[sewage]] outflows.&lt;ref name="NCDC"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ncdc.gov.uk/media/adobe/7/k/Strandline.pdf |publisher=[[North Cornwall District Council]] |title=Strandlliines |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071018204101/http://www.ncdc.gov.uk/media/adobe/7/k/Strandline.pdf |archivedate=2007-10-18 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Ecological significance==
The strandline is an important [[habitat]] for a variety of [[animal]]s. In parts of the [[United Kingdom]], [[sandhopper]]s such as ''[[Talitrus saltator]]'' and the [[seaweed fly]] ''[[Coelopa frigida]]'' are abundant in the rotting seaweed, and these invertebrates provide food for [[wader|shore birds]] such as the [[Eurasian rock pipit|rock pipit]], [[turnstone]]&lt;ref name="NCDC"/&gt; and [[pied wagtail]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.theheritagecoast.co.uk/natural_world/ecology_of_portland_harbour/strand_line.htm |title=Strand Line |author=Gunnleyg Eldevig &amp; Andrew Flack |publisher=[[The Heritage Coast]] |work=Ecology of Portland Harbour}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[mammal]]s such as [[European hare|brown hares]], [[red fox|foxes]], [[vole]]s and [[mouse|mice]].&lt;ref name="Durham"/&gt;

==Legal significance==
One kind of high water mark is the '''ordinary high water mark''' or '''average high water mark''', the high water mark that can be expected to be produced by a body of water in non-flood conditions. The ordinary high water mark may have legal significance and is often being used to demarcate [[property law|property]] [[boundary (real estate)|boundaries]].&lt;ref&gt;Bruce S. Flushman, ''Water Boundaries: Demystifying Land Boundaries Adjacent to Tidal Or Navigable Waters'' (2001), p. 72.&lt;/ref&gt; The ordinary high water mark has also been used for other legal demarcations. For example, a 1651 analysis of laws passed by the English Parliament notes that for persons granted the title [[Admiral (Royal Navy)|Admiral of the English Seas]], "the Admirals power extended even to the high water mark, and into the main streams".&lt;ref&gt;Nathaniel Bacon, ''The Continuation of an Historicall Discourse, of the Government of England until the end of the Reign of Queen Elizabeth'' (1651), p. 44.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[United States]], the high water mark is also significant because the [[United States Constitution]] gives Congress the authority to legislate for waterways, and the high water mark is used to determine the geographic extent of that authority. Federal regulations (33 CFR 328.3(e)) define the "ordinary high water mark" (OHWM) as "that line on the shore established by the fluctuations of water and indicated by physical characteristics such as a clear, natural line impressed on the bank, shelving, changes in the character of soil, destruction of terrestrial vegetation, the presence of litter and debris, or other appropriate means that consider the characteristics of the surrounding areas.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=U.S. Electronic Code of Federal Regulations|url=http://www.ecfr.gov/cgi-bin/text-idx?c=ecfr&amp;SID=2fcc86a0ae4919652ccaf4d67829679d&amp;rgn=div5&amp;view=text&amp;node=33:3.0.1.1.35&amp;idno=33}}&lt;/ref&gt; For the purposes of Section 404 of the [[Clean Water Act]], the OHWM defines the lateral limits of federal jurisdiction over non-tidal water bodies in the absence of adjacent wetlands. For the purposes of Sections 9 and 10 of the [[Rivers and Harbors Act of 1899]], the OHWM defines the lateral limits of federal jurisdiction over traditional navigable waters of the US.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=USACE 2005 OHWM Regulatory Guidance Letter|url=http://www.usace.army.mil/Portals/2/docs/civilworks/RGLS/rgl05-05.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; The OHWM is used by the [[United States Army Corps of Engineers]], the [[United States Environmental Protection Agency]], and other federal agencies to determine the geographical extent of their regulatory programs. Likewise, many states use similar definitions of the OHWM for the purposes of their own regulatory programs.

In 2016, the Court of Appeals of Indiana ruled that land below the OHWM (as defined by common law) along Lake Michigan is held by the state in trust for public use. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=''Gunderson v. State of Indiana, Indiana Department of Natural Resources'', Court of Appeals of Indiana, Opinion 46A03-1508-PL-1116, December 7, 2016| url=http://www.in.gov/judiciary/opinions/pdf/12071601msm.pdf}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Australia]], the definition of the Mean High Water Mark is '...the line of the medium high tide between the highest tide of each
lunar month (the springs) and the lowest each lunar month (the Neaps) averaged over the year.' (http://www.icsm.gov.au/publications/tidal_interface/compendium_full_may03.pdf)

'''ISO 3166-2:MH''' is the entry for the [[Marshall Islands]] in [[ISO 3166-2]], part of the [[ISO 3166]] [[standardization|standard]] published by the [[International Organization for Standardization]] (ISO), which defines [[code]]s for the names of the principal [[country subdivision|subdivision]]s (e.g., [[province]]s or [[state (administrative division)|state]]s) of all [[country|countries]] coded in [[ISO 3166-1]].

Currently for the Marshall Islands, ISO 3166-2 codes are defined for two levels of subdivisions:
* 2 chains (of islands) (i.e., the [[Ralik Chain]] and the [[Ratak Chain]])
* [[municipalities of the Marshall Islands|24 municipalities]]

The municipalities are inhabited atolls or islands. The ten uninhabited atolls and islands of the country are not listed:
* In Ralik Chain: [[Ailinginae Atoll]], [[Bikini Atoll]], [[Rongerik Atoll]], and [[Ujelang Atoll]] (previously inhabited and had its code deleted in [[#II-1|Newsletter II-1]])
* In Ratak Chain: [[Bikar Atoll]], [[Bokak Atoll]], [[Erikub Atoll]], [[Jemo Island]], [[Nadikdik Atoll]], and [[Toke Atoll]]

Each code consists of two parts, separated by a hyphen. The first part is {{mono|MH}}, the [[ISO 3166-1 alpha-2]] code of the Marshall Islands. The second part is either of the following:
* one letter: chains (of islands)
* three letters: municipalities

==Current codes==
Subdivision names are listed as in the ISO 3166-2 standard published by the ISO 3166 Maintenance Agency (ISO 3166/MA).

'''Isidis Planitia''' is a plain located inside a giant [[impact crater|impact basin]] on [[Mars]], centered at {{coord|12.9|87.0|globe:Mars}}; Isidis Planitia is partly in the [[Syrtis Major quadrangle]] and partly in the [[Amenthes quadrangle]]. It is the third biggest obvious impact structure on the planet after the [[Hellas Planitia|Hellas]] and [[Argyre Planitia|Argyre]] basins – it is about {{convert|1500|km|mi|abbr=on}} in diameter.

Isidis was likely the last major basin to be formed on Mars, having formed approximately 3.9 billion years ago during the [[Noachian|Noachian Period]].&lt;ref name="Ritzer2004"&gt;{{Citation

A study reported in Icarus, described the complex geologic history of parts of Isidis, especially areas near the Deuteronilus contact.  This contact is the supposed edge of a vast Martian ocean.  The researchers found evidence of a Late Hesperian/Early Amazonian Sea in the area.  The sea would have quickly frozen over.  [[Esker]]s formed under the ice.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Erkeling |first1=G. |last2=Reiss |first2=D. |last3=Hiesinger |first3=H. |last4=Ivanov |first4=M.A. |last5=Hauber |first5=E. |last6=Bernhardt |first6=H. |title=Landscape formation at the Deuteronilus contact in southern Isidis Planitia, Mars: Implications for an Isidis Sea? |journal=Icarus |date=November 2014 |volume=242 |pages=329–351 |doi=10.1016/j.icarus.2014.08.015 |bibcode=2014Icar..242..329E}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Just to the west of Isidis is [[Syrtis Major Planum]], a low-relief [[shield volcano]] that is a prominent dark albedo feature of Mars, which formed after the basin.&lt;ref name="Hiesinger2004"&gt;{{Citation

Around the Isidis basin [[magnesium carbonate]] was found by [[Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter|MRO]]. This mineral indicates that water was present and that it was not acidic, pH conditions more favorable for the evolution of life.&lt;ref name="MurchieMustard2009"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Murchie|first1=S.

The name "Isidis Planitia" follows the earlier name Isidis Regio ("Isis' Region").  [[Isis]] is the [[Egyptian pantheon|Egyptian goddess]] of heaven and fertility.

The [[Beagle 2]] lander was about to land in the eastern part of Isidis Planitia in December 2003, when contact with the craft was lost.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2701">The '''Jadar''' ({{Lang-sr-cyr|Јадар}}, {{IPA-sh|jǎːdar|pron}}) region begins roughly at the [[Osečina]] and it is divided in two sub-regions: Upper Jadar (around Osečina), which is part of much larger region of [[Rađevina]], and Lower Jadar, which is also part of another, larger region of [[Podrinje]]. Center of the Lower Jadar is the town of [[Loznica]], which is not on the Jadar river, but some 10&amp;nbsp;km to the southwest.

The region is located in the [[Jadar (Drina)|Jadar River valley]], bordered by the mountains of Vlašić, [[Cer (mountain)|Cer]], [[Gučevo]] and [[Sokolska planina]]. Lower Jadar is a low, agricultural area, while the Upper Jadar was an important mining region ([[antimony]] mines of Zavlaka and [[Bela Crkva (Krupanj)|Bela Crkva]]).

In August 1914, during [[World War I]], a major battle between the [[Austro-Hungary|Austro-Hungarian]] and Serbian army took place on the river. The Serbs defeated the Austrians. This battle known as [[Battle of Cer]], was the first victory of [[Allies of World War I|Allied forces]] in World War I. The march that is considered to be somewhat an alternative national anthem of Serbia depicts this battle (''[[Marš na Drinu]]'').

The mineral is notable for having a formula similar (lacking fluorine for a complete match) to that of the fictional [[kryptonite]], from the [[Superman]] [[comic book]]s and movies, was found in a mine in the Jadar region and has been named [[jadarite]], after the region.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Stanley|first=Christopher J.|last2=Jones|first2=Gary C.|last3=Rumsey|first3=Michael S.|last4=Blake|first4=Christopher|last5=Roberts|first5=Andrew C.|last6=Stirling|first6=John A.R.|last7=Carpenter|first7=Graham J.C.|last8=Whitfield|first8=Pamela S.|last9=Grice|first9=Joel D.|date=2007-08-01|title=Jadarite, LiNaSiB3O7(OH), a new mineral species from the Jadar Basin, Serbia|url=http://www.ingentaconnect.com/content/schweiz/ejm/2007/00000019/00000004/art00011;jsessionid=1rj3q58upvcbj.x-ic-live-02|journal=European Journal of Mineralogy|volume=19|issue=4|pages=575–580|doi=10.1127/0935-1221/2007/0019-1741}}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/science/nature/6584229.stm 'Kryptonite' discovered in mine]&lt;/ref&gt;

A number of Antarctic features were named after Norwegian royal family members. This is due to either the name being bestowed by [[Roald Amundsen]] when he reached the South Pole as the first person ever in 1911, or due to Norwegian feats of exploration or claims on the area.

A '''Local Notice to Mariners''' is an authoritative instruction issued by a designated official, typically the [[harbormaster]].

==United States==

In the United States, notices are issued by each [[U.S. Coast Guard]] District to disseminate important information affecting navigational safety within that District. This Notice reports changes and deficiencies in aids to navigation maintained by the Coast Guard. Other marine information such as new [[nautical chart|charts]], channel depths, naval operations, and regattas is included. Since temporary information of short duration is not included in the weekly [[Notice to Mariners]], the ''Local Notice to Mariners'' may be the only source of such information. Small craft using the [[Intracoastal Waterway]] and small harbors not normally used by oceangoing vessels need it to keep charts and publications up-to-date.

Since correcting information for U.S. charts in the ''Notice to Mariners'' is obtained from the Coast Guard Local Notices, it is normal to expect a lag of 1 or 2 weeks for the ''Notice to Mariners'' to publish a correction from this source.

The ''Local Notice to Mariners'' may be obtained free of charge by contacting the appropriate Coast Guard District Commander. Vessels operating in ports and waterways in several districts must obtain the ''Local Notice to Mariners'' from each district. &lt;!-- See Figure 422 for a complete list of U.S. Coast Guard Districts. provide a link instead--&gt;

===Sources===
The text of the US material originated from section 422 of The [[American Practical Navigator]], a document produced by the government of the [[United States|United States of America]].

==Examples==
LNTMs are, by definition, concerned with local issues. Each issuing authority has its own series of LNTMs – there is no international standard numbering or indexing scheme. Individual LNTMs may concern short or long term situations. At [http://www.qhmportsmouth.com/port-lntm/ Portsmouth], mariners are instructed by LNTM 28/07 to ''keep clear of warship berths''. At [http://www.holyheadport.com/LNTM%20Index.pdf Holyhead], LNTM 5/2008 concerns ''Bunkering or transferring oil in port''. At [http://www.conservancy.co.uk/water/local_notices.asp Chichester], No 16 of 2008 ''Sea defence works at Hayling Island'' gives timely information about dredging operations.

[[Denmark]] has long been involved with the wars of [[Northern Europe]] and, recently, elsewhere. In the early [[Middle Ages]], Danish [[Vikings]] invaded and conquered parts of the [[British Isles]] and [[Normandy]]. Later in the Middle Ages, Denmark was repeatedly in combat with [[Scandinavia]]n neighbours and in the [[Baltic Sea|Baltic]] area. The "Union Wars" of the 15th and early 16th centuries took place between Denmark and [[Sweden]], then united in the [[Kalmar Union]]. After Sweden broke away, Denmark{{snd}}until 1814 remaining united with [[Norway]]{{snd}}again confronted Sweden in the [[Northern Seven Years' War]] (1563&amp;ndash;70) and the [[Kalmar War]] (1611&amp;ndash;13). Denmark was heavily involved in the [[Thirty Years' War]] (1618–1648) on the side of the [[Protestants]] of the [[Germany|German]] lands. During the 16th to 18th centuries, Danish military involvement was also directed against [[Russia]] and other [[Eastern Europe]]an nations in the series of [[Northern Wars]] and subsequent campaigns. 

Denmark was brought into the [[Napoleonic Wars]] on the French side when attacked by Britain at the Battles of Copenhagen in [[Battle of Copenhagen (1801)|1801]] and [[Battle of Copenhagen (1807)|1807]]. The eventual defeat of Napoleon led to the break-up of the Denmark-Norway union. The next major combats were over control of [[Schleswig]], in the [[First Schleswig War|First]] and [[Second Schleswig War]]s. Denmark remained neutral in [[World War I]], but in [[World War II]] the country was [[German invasion of Denmark (1940)|occupied]], with little fighting, by [[Nazi Germany]] in 1940. 

As a member of the [[United Nations]] and [[NATO]], Denmark has participated in military operations since 1992: in [[Bosnian War|Bosnia]], [[War in Afghanistan (2001&amp;ndash;present)|Afghanistan]], [[2003 invasion of Iraq|Iraq]] and [[2011 military intervention in Libya|Libya]].

It also shares [[maritime boundary|maritime boundaries]] with [[Barbados]] to the northeast and [[Guyana]] to the southeast. The country covers an area of 5,128 square kilometers (1,979&amp;nbsp;sq&amp;nbsp;mi) and consists of two main islands, '''[[Trinidad]]''' and '''[[Tobago]]''', and [[Islands of Trinidad and Tobago|numerous smaller landforms]]. Trinidad is the larger and more populous of the main islands; Tobago is much smaller, comprising about 6% of the total area and 4% of the population. The nation lies outside the [[hurricane belt]].

Officially Trinidadians or Tobagonians, the people from Trinidad and Tobago are often informally referred to as ''Trinbagonians'' or ''[[Trini]]s'' (for Trinidadians). Unlike most of the English-speaking Caribbean, Trinidad and Tobago is a primarily industrialised country whose economy is based on [[petroleum]] and [[petrochemical]]s. Trinidad and Tobago is famous for its pre-[[Lent]]en [[Trinidad and Tobago Carnival|Carnival]] and as the birthplace of [[steelpan]], [[Calypso music|calypso]], [[Chutney music|chutney]], [[chutney-soca]], [[pichakaree]], [[chut-kai-pang]], [[cariso]], [[kaiso]], [[parang]], [[Soca music|soca]], and [[Limbo (dance)|limbo]].

&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nsc.gov.la/Products/Populationcensus2005/figure%20chapter2/2.1Population%20by%20province.JPG Population by province. 2005 Census] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101114034606/http://www.nsc.gov.la//Products/Populationcensus2005/figure%20chapter2/2.1Population%20by%20province.JPG |date=2010-11-14 }}&lt;/ref&gt; 
ranging from the largest (Savannakhet) to smallest (Sekong).

== History ==
In 1989 Vientiane prefecture was split from Vientiane province and the capital of Vientiane province moved from Vientiane to Muang Phôn-Hông. In 1994 Xaisômboun khetphiset (special region) was formed from parts of the Bolikhamxai, Vientiane, and Xiangkhoang provinces. In 2006 Xaisomboun special region was dissolved and the Longsan, Xaysomboun, Phun, and Hom districts added to Vientiane province, while Thathon district was transferred to Xiengkhuang province.

== Further divisions ==
The provinces are then subdivided into [[Districts of Laos|district]]s (''muang'') and villages (''baan'').

== Geography ==
The provinces are grouped geographically into 3 strata, North (from Phongsaly to Saiyabouly, Luang Prabang and Xiengkhuang), Central (Vientiane and Bolikhamxay) and South (from Khammuane to Champasack).

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2193">A '''Quran Belt''' is a region where [[conservative Islam]]ic values are strong. It is most commonly associated with an area where [[Islam]] has been historically influential in [[northwest China]] ([[Xinjiang]], [[Ningxia]], [[Gansu]] and [[Qinghai]]) along the borders of [[central Asia]], [[Tibet]] and [[Mongolia]].&lt;ref name="Gladney"&gt;{{cite book|last=Gladney|first=Dru C.|authorlink=Dru C.

'''Professor Sidney William Wooldridge''' [[CBE]], [[Royal Society|FRS]],&lt;ref name="frs"/&gt; [[Geological Society of London|FGS]] (16 November 1900 – 25 April 1963), geologist, [[Geomorphology|geomorphologist]] and [[geographer]], was a pioneer in the study of the geomorphology of south-east England and the first professor of geography at [[King's College London]]. He collaborated with [[Laurence Dudley Stamp|Dudley Stamp]] and with [[David Leslie Linton|David Linton]].

==Early life and education==
Sidney Wooldridge was born in [[Hornsey]], [[North London]] in 1900, the younger son of a bank clerk.&lt;ref&gt;1901 Census: RG13/1241, Folio 63 p.14. London: National Archives&lt;/ref&gt; His early childhood was spent in [[Cheam]], Surrey, and his later schooling in [[Wood Green]], north London, where he also took evening classes in geology. He read geology at [[King's College London]] (1918–1921), graduating with a first-class degree. Research in [[petrology]] led to an MSc (1923) and [[DSc]] (1927). His study of the [[Tertiary]] and [[Pleistocene]] deposits of the [[North Downs]] and [[Chiltern Hills]] of southern England led to an interest in geomorphology.&lt;ref name=baigent&gt;{{cite web |author=Elizabeth Baigent|title=Wooldridge, Sidney William (1900–1963)|work=Oxford Dictionary of National Biography|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=2004|url=http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/37017|accessdate=16 March 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Academic career==
In the 1920s and 30s Wooldridge lectured at King's on a combined geography and geology course with the [[London School of Economics]] (LSE). In the Joint School of Geography King's offered Geomorphology, Meteorology, Biogeography and the History of Geographical Discovery, while the LSE offered the Regional and Economic aspects, Historical Geography, and the Distribution of Man.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=A Century of Geography at LSE (1895 to 1995) |author=Wise M. |author2=Estall R. |publisher=LSE |date=7 July 1995 |url=http://www.lse.ac.uk/collections/geographyAndEnvironment/research/Researchpapers/rp60.pdf|format=PDF|accessdate=16 March 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;
During [[World War II]] this arrangement was disrupted by the [[Evacuations of civilians in Britain during World War II|evacuation]] of King's to [[Bristol]], requiring Wooldridge to teach human geography. His conversion to geography complete, he became professor of geography at [[Birkbeck, University of London|Birkbeck College, London]] in 1944, returning to King's in 1947 as its first professor of geography and remaining until his death in 1963.&lt;ref name=baigent /&gt;

Wooldridge was a founder-member of the [[Institute of British Geographers]] (1933) for academics dissatisfied with the [[Royal Geographical Society]]'s focus on amateur research and exploration; he was later IBG president (1949–50). He did not break completely with the RGS, serving on its council (1947–51). Wooldridge also served as president of the geography section of the [[British Association for the Advancement of Science|British Association]] (1950) and chaired the [[Field Studies Council]] in 1952.&lt;ref name=baigent /&gt;

==Research==
Wooldridge's work concentrated mainly on the [[London Basin]] and the [[Weald]], his first (1921) paper being on folding within the London Basin. Other publications looked at the [[Reading Beds]], [[Eocene]] and [[Pliocene]] deposits and the structural and geomorphological evolution of the basin. Inspired by the theories of [[William Morris Davis|W.M.Davis]] on [[Cycle of erosion|cycles of landscape evolution]], Wooldridge employed detailed fieldwork to identify features such as [[river terrace]]s and [[erosion surface]]s, for example a presumed platform at 200 feet above modern sea level. In the later 1930s collaboration with colleague [[David Leslie Linton|David Linton]] culminated in the 1939 classic ''Structure, Surface and Drainage of South-East England''.

The 'Wooldridge and Linton Model' of landscape evolution was dependent on the identification of remnants of three widely developed erosion surfaces: a warped sub-Eocene surface; a high-level unwarped [[Neogene]] [[peneplain]] and an unwarped [[Plio-Pleistocene]] marine platform. It explained both the concordant drainage&lt;ref&gt;Concordant streams flow in patterns that would be expected based on the geology, for example cutting valleys following outcrops of soft rocks.&lt;/ref&gt; pattern of the central Weald (through long-term [[subaerial|sub-aerial]] erosion), and the widespread discordant&lt;ref&gt;Discordant streams cut across the grain of the geology, as for example the Medway cutting through the scarp of the North Downs.&lt;/ref&gt; features (as being related to a high-level marine shelf).&lt;ref name=jones2&gt;Jones, D.K.C. (1980), The Tertiary evolution of south-east England with particular reference to the Weald, chapter 2 of Jones (Ed),  ''The Shaping of Southern England'', Institute of British Geographers Special Publication, No 11, London: Academic Press&lt;/ref&gt;

Wooldridge also collaborated with fellow King's alumnus [[Laurence Dudley Stamp|Dudley Stamp]]. Wooldridge had provided petrological input to a paper with Stamp on the [[Silurian]] of [[Wales]] as early as 1923 and, like Stamp, moved from geology towards human geography. Wooldridge's interest lay in relating early human settlement and land use to the physical landscape. In 1951 Stamp at LSE and Wooldridge at King's jointly edited ''London Essays in Geography''.

==Personal life==
Like Dudley Stamp, Wooldridge married a King's geography student, Edith Stephens. Wooldridge was a keen golfer and cricketer, a [[Congregationalist]] lay preacher (converting later to the [[Church of England]]) and an amateur [[operetta]] enthusiast. He continued to work after a stroke in 1954, dying in 1963.&lt;ref name=baigent /&gt;

==Legacy==
In 1980 the Institute of British Geographers marked the fortieth anniversary of ''Structure, Surface and Drainage in South-East England'' by the publication of ''The Shaping of Southern England'' (,&lt;ref name=jones&gt;Jones D.K.C. (Ed) (1980), ''The Shaping of Southern England'', Institute of British Geographers Special Publication, No 11, London: Academic Press&lt;/ref&gt; a collection of papers which both emphasised the importance of the work, and showed how dated it had become. Fundamentally, the 'Wooldridge and Linton Model' was based on the view that the south-east region had been tectonically stable except for two brief periods, in the Upper Cretaceous and the mid-Tertiary. Subsequent work has shown that this view is far too simplistic, throwing much of the interpretation of cycles of landscape evolution into doubt.&lt;ref name=jones2 /&gt;

More serious are criticisms of Wooldridge's overemphasis on form over process. However, his role as a pioneer geomorphologist, and emphasis on historical perspective and regional focus remained important.&lt;ref name=baigent /&gt;

==Awards==
Wooldridge received a number of awards to fund fieldwork, including the Royal Geographical Society's [[Murchison Award]] with [[David Leslie Linton|David Linton]] in 1942. He was made [[CBE]] in 1954 in recognition of his work on the Sand and Gravel Council. In 1957 he received the Royal Geographical Society's [[Victoria Medal (geography)|Victoria Medal]] and in 1959 was elected a [[Fellow of the Royal Society]], a rare honour among geographers.&lt;ref name=baigent /&gt;

Hiking the entire trail usually takes 40 to 50 days.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tokai-walk.jp/about.html|script-title=ja:東海自然歩道とは|language=Japanese|publisher=東海自然歩道連絡協会|accessdate=2008-09-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1969, the former Minister of Health, Labor, and Welfare (current Minister of the Environment), proposed establishing a long-distance hiking trail.  In 1970, with cooperation of related local governments, the construction project began, and was completed in 1974.  Subsequently, the idea of connecting two quasi-national parks gave rise to constructing an array of additional quasi-national parks along the path.  Numerous hills, wetlands, and canyons, which had not previously been viewed as tourist spots were designated as quasi-national parks and presently serve as nature preserves.

==Points of interest==
===[[Tokyo]]===
The first leg of the route goes through the Mount Takao area and offers a nice hiking trip starting at [[Keiō Line]] [[Takaosanguchi Station]] and reaching JR [[Sagamiko Station]].  Roughly four hours is expected to cover this segment of the walkway.

From the Takaosanguchi Station, the route climes through slopes of Mount Takao and first reaches the Takaosan Viewing Tower.  After Takaoyakuō-ji Temple, the trail connects to the summit, where the Takao Visitor Center awaits.  Passing through an aisle of cherry trees, the hiker next arrives at Hachiōji Castle.  From this point, the path descends to the flood plain of the [[Sagami River]].  Crossing Benten Bridge, the walkway leads to Sagami Dam to Sagami Station.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tokai-walk.jp/course_guide/course1.html|script-title=ja:1.高尾山付近コース|language=Japanese|publisher=東海自然歩道連絡協会|accessdate=2008-09-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Mount Takao====
[[Mount Takao]], rising 599 m above sea level, is an excellent place for wild landscapes with a wide variety of plants (1,600 species) and insects (6,000 species).  The area offers many hiking trails and view points.

The Takao Visitor Center is located at the summit, dedicated to offering information on the history and environment of the region.  At 599 m, the site offers a majestic vista of mountains from [[Mt. Fuji]] to [[Tanzawa]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tokai-walk.jp/prefecture/tokyo.html|script-title=ja:県別観光スポット一覧|language=Japanese|publisher=東海自然歩道連絡協会|accessdate=2008-09-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Takaoyakuō-ji====
Takaoyakuō-ji is a Buddhist temple situated on Mount Takao.  Its full name is Takao-san Yakuō-in Yūki-ji.  It was built by [[Gyōki]] on the command of [[Emperor Shōmu]].   The site had formerly been considered a holy mountain and attracted many [[Yamabushi|Shugendōshi]], Japanese mountain ascetic hermits practicing the strict doctrine of [[Shugendō]].  The temple was named “yakuō,” for it enshrines [[Yakushi]].  The temple offers a glimpse of [[Shinbutsu shūgō]], the fusion of Buddhism and [[Shinto]], as it contains Shinto style buildings and [[Torii]].

====[[Hachiōji Castle]]====
Hachiōji Castle is a yamashiro, a castle built on a mountain.  It is situated on Shiro-yama (445m) in Hachiōji, Tokyo.  The castle measures roughly 2&amp;nbsp;km from east to west and 1&amp;nbsp;km from north to south.  The structure made use of the mountain’s complex surfaces of steep ridges and deep valleys and was divided into a few areas.  It was first built by [[Hōjō Ujiteru]] in 1587.  In 1590, the fortress fell when attacked by [[Maeda Toshiie]], [[Sanada Masayuki]], and [[Uesugi Kagekatsu]] during the [[Toyotomi Hideyoshi]]’s campaign to eliminate the [[Hōjō clan]].  Currently, the site features a reconstructed bridge and parts of the main palace, along with [[kuruwa]], stone walls, and moats.

===[[Kanagawa Prefecture]]===
In Kanagawa Prefecture, the course starts at Mt. Shiroyama(Kobotoke Shiroyama) on borders with [[Tokyo Prefecture]]. Then it leads down through Kobotoke Pass to [[Lake Sagami]], and subsequently ascends into the [[Tanzawa]] mountains. Although bypasses the main ridge, this part of the trail goes through many peaks over 1200m (with the highest being Mt. Sodehirayama), and is considered to be the steepest and hardest part of the whole trail. After 127.5 kilometers, the course in [[Kanagawa Prefecture]] ends at Kiridooshi Pass on the border with [[Yamanashi Prefecture]].

Main orientation points on the route (including altitude):

*Mt. Shiroyama (672m)
*Mt. Arashiyama (406m)
*Mt. Sekirouzan (694m)
*Nishinono village (303m)
*Mt. Kibigarayama (1273m)
*Mt. Sodehirayama (1432m)

*Mt. Azegamaru (1293m)
*Mt. Komotsurushiyama (1348m)
*Mt. Takasasuyama (1174m)
*Kiridooshi Pass (1080m)

===[[Yamanashi Prefecture]]===

In [[Yamanashi Prefecture]], the trail starts at Kiridooshi Pass at the western end of [[Tanzawa]] mountains. Then it encircles the northern slope of Mt. Fuji, passing along attractive tourist spots like 8 Springs of Mt. Fuji and [[Fuji Five Lakes]]. From Motosu Lake, the route briefly enters [[Shizuoka Prefecture]] via Wariishi Pass, going through [[Asagiri Plateau]] and along Lake Tanuki, where it returns to [[Yamanashi Prefecture]] with a climb to Mt. Choujagadake in [[Tenshi Mountains]]. After 115&amp;nbsp;km, the trail leaves [[Yamanashi Prefecture]] at Tashiro Pass.

Main orientation points along the route (including altitudes):

*Kiridooshi Pass (1080m)
*Mt. Oohirayama (1295m)
*[[Oshino Hakkai]] (8 springs of Mt.Fuji) (928m)
*Fuji Visitor's Center (870m)
*Mt. Ashiwadayama/Gokodai (1355m)

'''Vakhushti''' ({{lang-ka|ვახუშტი}}) (1696–1757) was a [[Georgians|Georgian]] royal prince (''[[batonishvili]]''), geographer, historian and cartographer. His principal historical and geographic works, ''[[Description of the Kingdom of Georgia]]'' and the ''Geographical Atlas'', were inscribed on [[UNESCO]]'s [[Memory of the World Register]] in 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=''Description of Georgian Kingdom''&lt;!-- sic --&gt; and the Geographical Atlas of Vakhushti Bagrationi|url=http://www.unesco.org/new/en/communication-and-information/flagship-project-activities/memory-of-the-world/register/full-list-of-registered-heritage/registered-heritage-page-2/description-of-georgian-kingdom-and-the-geographical-atlas-of-vakhushti-bagrationi/| work=Memory of the World Register|publisher=UNESCO|accessdate=31 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Life ==

An illegitimate son of King [[Vakhtang VI of Kartli]] (ruled 1716–24), he was born in [[Tbilisi]], 1696. Educated by the brothers [[Garsevanishvili]] and a [[Roman Catholic]] mission, he was fluent in [[Greek language|Greek]], [[Latin language|Latin]], [[French language|French]], [[Turkish language|Turkish]], [[Russian language|Russian]] and [[Armenian language|Armenian]].

In 1719 and 1720, he took part in two successive campaigns against the rebel duke (''[[eristavi]]'') [[Shanshe, Duke of the Ksani|Shanshe of the Ksani]]. From August to November 1722, he was a governor of the kingdom during his father’s absence at the [[Ganja (city)|Ganja]] campaign. Later he served as a commander in [[Kvemo Kartli]]. After the [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] occupation of [[Kartli]], he followed King Vakhtang in his emigration to the [[Russian Empire]] in 1724. Retired to [[Moscow]], [[Tsarevich]] Vakhusht (as he came to be known in Russia) was granted a pension. He died at Moscow in 1757. He was buried at the [[Donskoy Monastery]] in [[Moscow]], a traditional burial ground of Georgian emigrant royalty and nobility.

== Works ==

Most of his works were written or completed in Moscow. The best known are ''[[Description of the Kingdom of Georgia]]'' (completed in 1745), ''The Geographic Description of Georgia'' (completed in 1750) and two geographic atlases of the [[Caucasus]] region accompanied by the images of several historic coats of arms (1745–46). 
[[File:Vakhushti bagrationi map of europe 1752.jpg|thumb|left|Map of Europe by Vakhushti Bagrationi, 1752]]
His famous ''Description of the Kingdom of Georgia'' is essentially an adorned synopsis of the initial texts of the corpus of medieval Georgian annals, ''Kartlis Tskhovreba''. Vakhushti was critical of the re-edition of the corpus assembled by a scholarly commission chaired by his father Vakhtang VI. So as to rectify perceived oversights of Vakhtang's version, Vakhushti compiled his own comprehensive history and geographical description of the Georgian people and lands. One of the chief goals of his corrective was to underscore all-Georgian political and cultural unity despite the fact that Georgia was politically divided among competing kings and princes during Vakhushti’s lifetime. The popularity of Vakhushti’s tome is evidenced by the many copies made of it, and his narrative significantly shaped the way in which subsequent generations have conceived of an all-Georgian past.&lt;ref&gt;Rapp, Stephen H. (2003), ''Studies In Medieval Georgian Historiography: Early Texts And Eurasian Contexts'', pp. 423–4. Peeters Bvba {{ISBN|90-429-1318-5}}.&lt;/ref&gt; It is also a major source on the Georgian history of the 16th and 17th centuries.&lt;ref name="Suny"&gt;[[Ronald Grigor Suny|Suny, Ronald Grigor]] (1994), ''The Making of the Georgian Nation: 2nd edition'', p. 352. [[Indiana University Press]], {{ISBN|0-253-20915-3}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Vakhushti's works were soon translated into Russian and later into French&lt;ref name=FtranslationDescription/&gt; and served as a guide to many contemporary [[Europe]]an scholars and travelers to Caucasus up to the early 20th century.

He also completed, together with his brother, Prince Bakar, the printing of the [[Bible]] in Georgian, which he had been only partly done by their father, Vakhtang VI. He established for that purpose, in his house near Moscow, a printing-press, taught the art of printing to several Georgian clergymen, and completed the first printed edition of the Bible in Georgian in 1743. The printing-press was afterwards transferred to Moscow, where several religious works in Georgian were printed.

== Family ==
Vakhushti married in 1717 Mariam, youngest daughter of [[Giorgi-Malakia Abashidze]], [[Kingdom of Imereti|ex-King of Imereti (1702–07)]], and had several children:

* [[Ivan Vakhushtovich Bagration|Prince Ioane]] (1719–1781), general in the Russian service;
* Princess Alexandra (12 August 1721 – 8 April 1789);
* Prince David (1723–1819);
* Princess Mariam (1724–1807); 
* Prince Domenti (1728–1737);
* Prince Nikoloz (died 6 November 1784);
* Princess Anna (1744–1779);
* [[Iotam Bagration|Prince Iotam]] (fl. 1737);
* Prince Petre (fl. 1737);
* Princess Guka (fl. 1737).

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2612">A '''Waulsortian mudmound''' is a geographical feature formed in warm tropical waters in the [[Viséan]] geological age, now transposed to the temperate regions in Europe. It is a type of bioconstruction, rich in fossils.
The rock comprises light grey, unbedded, [[Folk classification#Folk's carbonate classification|micritic limestone]], heavily jointed with [[calcite]] veining. There is some [[galena]] and [[sphalerite]] mineralisation in the joints. The fossils are mainly [[Crinoid]] [[Ossicle (echinoderm)|ossicles]] together with [[gastropod]]s and [[brachiopod]]s.

The term Waulsortian was first used in 1863 to describe an area of limestone near [[Waulsort]] in [[Namur (province)|Namur]], Belgium. Similar mudstone was recognised in the [[Clitheroe]] area of Lancashire England by Arthur Vaughan in 1916.{{sfn|Kabrna|2011|p=20}}

==Formation==
On a firm bed of limestone, under the deep waters of the tropical sea, crinoids fixed themselves to the rock. The oceans gentle currents eroded the base rock creating a lime-rich mud which was propelled by the current. Where the water was too rapid, the crinoids were displaced, but where it was slower they formed a barrier which arrested the mud forming a micritic deposit. Further crinoids attached themselves, and the deposit thickened to an eventual depth of 200m. In the mudmound one finds fossils of the crinoids bone structure and the angle of deposit shows the direction and speed of mudflow.{{sfn|Kabrna|2011|pp=19-24}}

==Clitheroe reef belt==
There has been much debate on how the low micritic limestone hills in the Craven Basin were formed, one theory led to them being called reef knolls, knoll reefs,or bioherms but work in 1972 by Miller &amp; Grayson&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Miller|first1=J.|last2=Grayson|first2=R.F.|title=Origin and structure of Lower Viséan "reef"limestones near Clitheroe, Lancashire|journal=proceedings of the Yorkshire Geological Society|date=1972|volume=38|pages=607–638}}&lt;/ref&gt; identified them as mud mounds with the same fossil content as those near Waulsort. They include accessible geological sites at [[Clitheroe Castle]], Salthill and Bellman quarries, Crow Hill and Worsaw, Gerna and Sykes.&lt;ref name=crb&gt;{{cite web|last1=Kabrna|first1=Paul|title=Clitheroe Reef Belt|url=http://www.kabrna.com/cpgs/craven/reef_belt.htm|website=Craven Basin:Waulsortian Mudmounds|publisher=Craven &amp; Pendle Geological Society|accessdate=8 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;
