'''''A Return to Love: Reflections on the Principles of [[A Course in Miracles]]''''' (1992) is the first book by author [[Marianne Williamson]] and a [[The New York Times Best Sellers List|''New York Times'' Best seller]].

==Exposure==
''A Return to Love'' spent 39 weeks on the New York Times best sellers list in 1992.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=BEST SELLERS: November 29, 1992|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1992/11/29/books/best-sellers-november-29-1992.html |newspaper=[[The New York Times]] |date=November 29, 1992|accessdate=December 30, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; A decade later, ''A Return to Love'' was credited as being one of the two books that helped bring [[New Age]] perspectives to the American mainstream.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.publishersweekly.com/article/CA319870.html?pubdate=9%2F1%2F2003&amp;display=archive ''Publisher's Weekly'' September 1, 2003]&lt;/ref&gt;

Twenty years after her first appearance with the book, Williamson was interviewed again by Oprah Winfrey in July 2012, this time in a ''[[Super Soul Sunday]]'' (OWN TV) episode titled, "20 Years After A Return to Love".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title =Oprah and Marianne Williamson: 20 Years After A Return to Love |publisher=OWN TV, Super Soul Sunday | url = http://www.oprah.com/own-super-soul-sunday/Full-Episode-Oprah-and-Marianne-Williamson-Video |date=July 29, 2012|accessdate = 2013-12-30 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Robert Todd Carroll]], of ''[[The Skeptic's Dictionary]]'', writes, "Williamson might be called Oprah's patron saint. She's all about love and healing, yin and yang, being wounded, and using love and prayer to heal all wounds. ''A Return to Love: Reflections on the Principles of A Course In Miracles'' (1992) was number one on the ''[[Publishers Weekly]]'' non-fiction best-sellers list for 11 weeks. Williamson promoted her book and ACIM when she appeared on the ''Oprah Winfrey Show'', an episode that received more pro viewer mail than any other show for 1992. She also spoke of the book, and the course when she was interviewed by [[Barbara Walters]] on the ABC television news show [[20/20 (US television series)|''20/20'']].&lt;ref&gt;[http://skepdic.com/cim.html#*** ''Skeptics Dictionary'' ACIM listing] Retrieved June 30, 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

An '''adverbial complement''' is an [[adverbial]] that is required to complete the meaning of a verb, such that if it is removed, it will yield an ungrammatical sentence or an intrinsically different meaning of the verb. They stand in contrast to adverbial [[Adjunct (grammar)|adjuncts]], which can be removed from a sentence without altering its structure or meaning.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thefreedictionary.com/Adverbial-Complements.htm |title=Adverbial Complements |website=Thefreedictionary.com |date= |accessdate=2016-11-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Adverbial complements often accompany [[verbs]] of caused motion such as ''put'' or ''place'':

*She put the cheese ''back''.
*&lt;nowiki&gt;*&lt;/nowiki&gt;She put the cheese.
*Now place the vase ''on the mantlepiece''.
*&lt;nowiki&gt;*&lt;/nowiki&gt;Now place the vase.

However, they can occur with other types of verbs as well:

*We are staying ''in a hotel''.
*&lt;nowiki&gt;*&lt;/nowiki&gt;We are staying.

==Theoretical approaches==
[[Head-driven phrase structure grammar]] describes adverbial complements as part of the [[verb]]s' [[subcategorization frame]], which is why they are obligatory arguments. In this theory, adverbial complements are stored in the [[lexicon]] as part of the grammatical competence relating to the verb.

An alternative description, along the lines of [[construction grammar]] is that they are parts of certain [[argument structure constructions]] – in this case the caused motion construction – which are specifically compatible with the semantics of the verb. Here, adverbial complements are stored in the grammar as part of the caused motion construction which is a sign in its own right.

Another [[grammatical construction|construction]]-based theory combines the two arguing that certain senses of verbs co-occur so frequently with certain argument structure constructions, that the argument structures are also stored as part of the grammatical competence relating to the verb. These small argument structure constructions are called [[mini-constructions]]. So, in the case of ''put'', in accordance with this theory, adverbial complements are both part of the argument structure construction and stored as information regarding the verb itself.

'''Avoidance speech''' is a group of sociolinguistic phenomena in which a special restricted speech style must be used in the presence of or in reference to certain relatives. Avoidance speech is found in many [[Australian Aboriginal languages]]&lt;ref&gt;Dixon, R.M.W. (1980). "Speech and song styles: Avoidance styles". In ''The languages of Australia'' (Sections 3.3–3.4, pp. 58–68). Cambridge: Cambridge University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Austronesian languages]]&lt;ref&gt;Simons, Gary. 1982. Word taboo and comparative Austronesian linguistics. ''Pacific Linguistics'' C–76:157–226.&lt;/ref&gt; as well as some [[North American languages]], [[Highland East Cushitic languages]]&lt;ref&gt;Treis, Yvonne. 2005. Avoiding their names, avoiding their eyes: How Kambaata women respect their in-laws. ''Anthrolological Linguistics'' 47.3:292–320&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Bantu languages]].&lt;ref&gt;Herbert, Robert K. 1990. ''Hlonipha'' and the Ambiguous Woman. ''Anthropos'' 85:455–473.&lt;/ref&gt;

Avoidance speech styles tend to have the same [[phonology]] and [[grammar]] as the standard language they are a part of. The [[lexicon]], however, tends to be smaller than in normal speech since the styles are only used for limited communication.

==Australia==
Avoidance speech in [[Australian Aboriginal languages]] is closely tied to elaborate tribal kinship systems in which certain relatives are considered [[taboo]]. Avoidance relations differ from tribe to tribe in terms of strictness and to whom they apply. Typically, there is an avoidance relationship between a man and his mother-in-law, usually between a woman and her father-in-law, and sometimes between any person and their parent-in-law of the same sex. For some tribes, avoidance relationships are extended to other family members, such as the mother-in-law's brother in [[Warlpiri language|Warlpiri]] or [[Parallel and cross cousins|cross-cousins]] in [[Dyirbal language|Dyirbal]]. All relations are [[classificatory kinship|classificatory]] – more people may fall into the "mother-in-law" category than just a man's wife's mother.&lt;ref&gt;Dixon 1980: 58–59&lt;/ref&gt;

Avoidance speech styles used with taboo relatives are often called '''mother-in-law languages''', although they are not actually separate languages but separate [[lexical set]]s with the same [[grammar]] and [[phonology]]. Typically, the taboo lexical set has a one-to-many correspondence with the everyday set. For example, in Dyirbal the avoidance style has one word, ''jijan'', for all lizards and iguanas while the everyday style differentiates many varieties. In [[Guugu Yimithirr language|Guugu Yimidhirr]] the avoidance speech verb ''bali-l'' "travel" covers several everyday verbs meaning "go", "walk", "crawl", "paddle", "float, sail, drift", and "limp along". Corresponding avoidance and everyday words are generally not linguistically related. Avoidance forms tend to be longer than everyday forms.&lt;ref&gt;Dixon 1980:  61–64&lt;/ref&gt;

In some areas, the avoidance style is used by both members of the avoidance relationship; in others the older member may talk to the younger in everyday style. Behavior associated with avoidance speech is a continuum and varies between tribes. For the Dyirbal people, a man and his mother-in-law may not make eye contact, face one another or directly talk to each other. Rather, they must address a third person or even a nearby object. For slightly less restricted relationships, such as between a man and his father-in-law, avoidance style is used and must be spoken in a slow, soft voice. An extreme case of avoidance behavior is found in the [[Umpila language|Umpila]], in which a man and his mother-in-law may not speak at all in each other’s presence.&lt;ref&gt;Dixon 1980: 59–60&lt;/ref&gt;

Children in these cultures acquire avoidance speech forms as part of their normal language development, learning with whom to use them at a fairly young age.&lt;ref&gt;Dixon 1980: 60&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, a few languages have another style, called a "secret language" or "mystic language", that is taught to boys as part of initiation rituals, and is only used between men.&lt;ref&gt;Dixon 1980: 65–68&lt;/ref&gt;

==Africa==
A special system of avoidance vocabulary is traditionally used by married women speaking [[Highland East Cushitic languages]] in southwestern Ethiopia. In [[Kambaata language|Kambaata]] and [[Sidamo language|Sidamo]], this system is called ''ballishsha'', and includes physical and linguistic avoidance of parents-in-law.&lt;ref&gt;Anbessa Tefera. 1987. Ballissha : Women's Speech Among the Sidama, ''Journal of Ethiopian Studies'', vol. XX, pp. 44–59.&lt;/ref&gt; Women who practice ''ballishsha'' do not pronounce any words beginning with the same syllable as the name of their husband’s mother or father.&lt;ref&gt;Treis 2005: 292–294&lt;/ref&gt; Instead, they may use [[paraphrase]], synonyms or semantically similar words, antonyms, or [[loanword|borrowings]] from other languages.&lt;ref&gt;Treis 2005: 295&lt;/ref&gt;

''Hlonipha'', or ''isihlonipho'', is a traditional system of avoidance speech in [[Nguni languages|Nguni Bantu languages]] of southern Africa including [[Zulu language|Zulu]], [[Xhosa language|Xhosa]] and [[Swazi language|Swazi]].&lt;ref&gt;Herbert 1990: 456&lt;/ref&gt; This special speech style and correlating respectful behaviors may be used in many contexts, but is most strongly associated with married women in respect to their father-in-law and other senior male relatives. Women who practice ''hlonipha'' may not say the names of these men or any words with the same [[Root (linguistics)|root]] as their names.&lt;ref&gt;Herbert 1990:457–459&lt;/ref&gt; They avoid the taboo words phonologically (substituting sounds) or lexically (substituting words with synonyms, etc.). The ''hlonipha'' system also includes avoidance of the names of certain relatives by all speakers and physical avoidance of certain relatives.&lt;ref&gt;Herbert 1990: 460–461&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Cañada de la Virgen''' is an [[Otomi people|Otomi]] archaeological site that has been recently excavated. Located in the Mexican state of [[Guanajuato]], the site was first excavated in 1995, while the official excavation began in 2002.
Public access was first allowed in 2011. However, unlike its famous counterparts such as Chichen-Itzá, access is strictly controlled due to it sitting on [[private property]], one of the largest ex-[[hacienda]]s in Guanajuato.&lt;ref name=INAH1&gt;{{cite web|title= Cañada de la Virgen|url=http://www.inah.gob.mx/es/boletines/2560-abren-zona-arqueologica-canada-de-la-virgen|work=Opening of the Cañada de la Virgen Archeological Zone|publisher=INAH|language=Spanish|accessdate=24 June 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
The [[Otomi people]] have lived in the valley of [[San Miguel De Allende]] for thousands of years.  It is presumed that construction at Cañada De La Virgen most likely began after the collapse of the [[Teotihuacan]] culture, where they are believed to have previously resided along with other tribes in the Valley of Mexico (near Mexico City today), around 530 AD.  The [[Otomi people|Otomi]] were avid sky watchers and passed information down from generation to generation.  These people used astronomical criteria, religious beliefs and agricultural cycles to select the Laja River Valley for the construction of this [[Pre-Hispanic]] burial site. The site faces the celestial north, where the stars spin around in a circle throughout the year. The moon moves up the stairs of the pyramid as its cycle advances. It rises and falls perfectly in pyramid notches at key times in the lunar calendar and during solstice periods.

The site was ruled by the Moon, the Sun, and Venus, as demonstrated by archaeoastronomical studies conducted by the National Institute of Anthropology and History (INAH). Its main features are:  Ceremonial Avenue, House of the Wind, House of the Longest Night- scientists believe has some relationship with the Otomi’s belief in the duality of the heavens and earth (Sun and Moon, Man and Woman, etc.), and House of the Thirteen Heavens.

Around 900 AD, the Otomi civilization began to decline and by 1050 AD, the site was abandoned, only to be rediscovered at the end of the 20th century. Work and research continue to this day.

==Site==
On site are seven enormous architectonic structures (pyramidal structures) of different sizes and styles, that form sunken patios, squares, a game of ball, esplanades, and a {{convert|1|km|mi|adj=mid|-long}} road. Ceramic superficial vestiges found suggest that the last occupation would be tied chronologically to the Toltec expansion.

This prehispanic settlement is located on the northern [[Mesoamerican]] border, its main monuments were sky observatories. Its urban design reflects cosmic cycles linked with farmers’ groups’ life that also were hunter-gatherer in the surrounding semi-desert regions, and traded with other Mesoamerican regions artifacts used in ritual activities.&lt;ref name=INAH1/&gt;

The site shares Mesoamerican architectural-oriented patterns, i.e. the symmetry axis is directed to the Sun and Moon rise and setting (East-West), in addition to its strategic position -visual domain of the Laja river basin, where the site is located - determined the pre-Hispanic site importance for rituals and ceremonies.

The close relationship between the architectural complex construction and star cycles is mainly observed on complex A or "13 skies House" vital space for the celestial observation, whose sunken patio functioned as water mirror from which the priests could look at the sky and interpret aspects in the interests for the agricultural cycle.

The buildings on site are located on a plateau that was artificially filled to obtain an 18° tilt, thus ancient Otomi managed the Sun to pass over various points of the architectural complex, marking calendar dates linked to survival control as well as seeding and harvesting activities.

==History==
The Toltec-Chichimec  founded villages, built pyramids and other architectural structures throughout the central basin of the river now called Laja, known as San Miguel in the 16th century, and apparently, a little less than thousand years ago was called Pánuco.&lt;ref name=Nieto1&gt;{{cite web|title= Enclave tolteca en tierras chichimecas|url=http://www.mexicodesconocido.com.mx/canada-de-la-virgen-en-guanajuato.-enclave-tolteca-en-tierras-chichimecas.html|work= Luis Nieto, No. 229/Marzo 1996|publisher= México Desconocido|language=Spanish|accessdate=1 August 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the list of names appearing in the [[Historia Tolteca-Chichimeca|Toltec - Chichimec Codex]], which refers to the various provinces that formed the Toltec Empire, Cañada de la Virgen would be located northwest of the Toltec territory. The name of its capital is unknown, because the name is unreadable in the abovementioned list, everything indicates it is located a few kilometers south of the site in question. It is a city made up of various architectural, elements including a [[Mesoamerican ballgame|ballgame court]] and a huge plaza with three pyramid foundations.

Furnaces remains found in the northeast area demonstrate that members of this society were capable of lime stone deposits exploitation. The Seven onsite architectural structures, considered monumental as exceed the human scale, are huge step pyramids with sloped sides of different sizes and styles that form various spaces, such as sunken patios, squares, esplanades, a {{convert|1,000|m|ft|adj=mid|-long}} road.

==Occupation chronology==
According to surface ceramic vestiges ([[Plumbate]]), the last occupation would be linked to the maximum Toltec expansion.&lt;ref name=Nieto1/&gt;

The historical overview of the region begins in the preclassical period with the Chupícuaro, tradition, very important in Mesoamerica. This tradition is characterized by its advanced ceramic industry and its complex religious expressions, which indicate at an early consolidation of a group in power. The Chupícuaro tradition was established along the banks of rivers and spread to almost the entire Guanajuato territory. Chupícuaro disappeared at about 350 AD., to allow the second tradition of advanced farmers.&lt;ref name=Gabriela1&gt;{{cite web|title=Articulo La Virgen Arqueomex|url=http://www.arqueomex.com/S2N3nLaVIRGEN73.html|work=ENAH Archaeologist|publisher=Gabriela Zepeda García Moreno INAH Guanajuato Investigator|language=Spanish|accessdate=1 August 2010|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100905010607/http://www.arqueomex.com/S2N3nLaVIRGEN73.html#|archive-date=2010-09-05|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Also identified as the regional development stage, the Sunken Patio tradition covers the classic and epiclassical periods (350 to 900 AD.) It distinguished itself by architectural innovation of sunken or closed patios, associated with pyramidal structures reaching monumental heights. This is considered to be the stage of advanced agricultural development and the expansion of the border northward.&lt;ref name="Gabriela1"/&gt;

During this period Guanajuato developed an organization and work specialization in governing centers. Still heavily argued and linked to the agricultural frontier withdrawal, new hypotheses about Toltec presence propose that it coincided with the arrival of proto-Toltec groups to the Basin of Mexico, between 900 and 1000 AD., and not with the collapse of Tula, Hidalgo, around 1200 AD.&lt;ref name="Gabriela1"/&gt;

Around 1350 AD., with the collapsed agricultural frontier, these lands were the scene of the development of the Chichimec tribes. With different ethnic affiliation, identified are the guachichiles, guamare, copuces, guaxabanes, pames, and Otomi. At that time, the border between nomadic and sedentary groups was the Lerma River. At this cultural scenario epoch can be placed the prehispanic development of Cañada de la Virgen.&lt;ref name="Gabriela1"/&gt;

==Architecture==
[[File:Pirámide, cañada de la virgen.JPG|thumbnail|Remains of a pyramidal structure]]
Cañada de la Virgen consists of closely linked architectural complexes. Special note for Complex A or “13 Sky House” - critical space for celestial observation - consists of a sunken patio, a pyramidal basement (over 15 m high) and platforms that close to the East, North and South as a whole. Funeral findings in this complex have given rise to forensic studies that have provided information about cultural and cranial deformation, burial, ancestral worship and rituals associated with the foundation of workplace practices. At the top of the complex is the Red Temple and its abstract mural, which are red and black horizontal bands which allude to the day and night.&lt;ref name=Gabriela2&gt;{{cite web|title=Articulo Cañada de la Virgen Arqueomex|url=http://www.arqueomex.com/S2N3nLaVIRGEN73.html|work=ENAH Archaeologist|publisher=Gabriela Zepeda García Moreno INAH Guanajuato Investigator|language=Spanish|accessdate=1 August 2010|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100905010607/http://www.arqueomex.com/S2N3nLaVIRGEN73.html#|archive-date=2010-09-05|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As part of the central campus is complex B or “House of the longest night”. It is an architectonic group with several structures (pyramid basement, sunken patio and platforms) which had different functions. An example is the asymmetry of the pyramidal basement (laid out Southwest), which has a room in the South side on the walls. This architectonic type is only documented in the Maya area (Yucatec Puuc) and Cañada de la Virgen. During archaeological excavations in this compound a cross section public functions and rituals substructure with was found.&lt;ref name=Gabriela3&gt;{{cite web|title=ENAH Archaeologist|url=http://www.arqueomex.com/S2N3nCanada92.html|work=Articulo Cañada de la Virgen Arqueomex|publisher=Gabriela Zepeda García Moreno INAH Guanajuato Investigator|language=Spanish|accessdate=1 August 2010|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101026213413/http://www.arqueomex.com/S2N3nCanada92.html#|archive-date=2010-10-26|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Structures==
The site consists of five groups of monuments, the most important of which is Complex A (side annexes, Temple basement, closed patio, main esplanade, south esplanade and road).&lt;ref name=Miguel1&gt;[http://www.sanmiguelguide.com/canada-de-la-virgen/esp.htm Zona Arqueológica Cañada de la Virgen] Guia San Miguel. Acceso Agosto 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

During excavations several important archaeological items were found, such as pots ([[Olla]]s, metals, seeds, human remains, etc.&lt;ref name="Miguel1"/&gt;

The main square, located west of the site comprises basements A and B, which are the most important. Basement A, with the largest volume and complexity, is composed of different elements: step pyramid, stairways, building or upper temple, central and side patios, esplanade and an avenue.

===Complex A===

As in most cases, the largest volume basement was found at the center, the remainder is distributed in all directions, configuring various squares and esplanades.&lt;ref name=Nieto1/&gt;

Six bodies comprise the pyramidal basement; at the top are remains of a building. The patio geometry in relation to the plaza-esplanade and eastern road denotes the domain reached by the Toltec-Chichimec architects in design and construction. The top building was divided into two sections by a central staircase, similar to late postclassical Aztec structures. It was built with stone walls plastered with mud and stucco (mixture of lime and sand) and painted red oxide (towards its penultimate occupation) and ochre (last). Indicated by remains at the southwest corner of one of the rooms that still exist, miraculously if we consider that in the late 1940s it was dynamited, losing much of northwest side corner.&lt;ref name=Miguel1/&gt;

===Complex B===

[[File:Cañada de La Virgen Complex B.jpg|thumb|House of the Longest Night]]It shares characteristics, with some small variations. In this case, the top building is a little to the south, i.e. is not centered with the plaza. To the west is a little elevated esplanade which forms part of the main square. There is some evidence there was another road, which would start at the south side of the basement to another part of the ravine surrounding the site. It is worth noting that in this structure patio remains of a stone anthropomorphic sculpture were found, consistent with what would be the head and left foot of some postclassical individual from the northern center of Mesoamerica.&lt;ref name=Miguel1/&gt;

===Complex C===
This complex has not yet been excavated (as of 2017).

===Complex D===
[[File:Cañada de La Virgen Complexes D and A.jpg|thumb|House of the Wind (foreground) and House of the Thirteen Heavens (background)]]
North basement, with very special features, such as a mixed base: the bottom base is rectangular, while those at top are circular; this mixture has only been found on very few structures of the region.

===Complex E===
The structure at the south of the complex, comprises a step pyramid basement forming an open patio to the south, unlike the others enclosed on four sides. A piece of stonework that may correspond to a frieze sector or a jamb was detected on the northeast corner of the structure.

== Restoration==
The constant looting and vandalism in the main basement of Complex (A), mainly the large holes at the bottom, on bodies 2 and 3, made necessary in 1989 to make some partial restoration interventions (architectural volumetric restitution) to prevent the collapse of the southwest corner of the basement, the upper bodies stability was compromised.

==Visiting the Site==
The archaeological complex opened to the public on February 15, 2011. The site is open Tuesday through Sunday, from 9 am to 3 pm. For those without transportation or seeking bilingual guides, there are multiple tour operators in San Miguel de Allende that can provide expert guides and transportation.

The site is unusually protected and there are some considerations for visitors.  There is a Visitor Center with parking and a museum (opened in 2017).  Access to the site is only by a scheduled shuttle bus which takes visitors near the site.  From there, the walk is roughly 3&amp;nbsp;km round trip, and you must be accompanied by an escort who will ensure that you return to your shuttle bus on schedule; round trip time from the Visitor Center is 2.5 hrs. No bags, backpacks or purses are allowed into the site because of recent thefts of artifacts. Small camera bags, cameras, and water are allowed.  Visitors with mobility issues may find the tour challenging.

}}'''Corchiano''' is a town and ''[[comune]] ''in the [[province of Viterbo]], [[Lazio]], central [[Italy]]. It was an ancient settlement of the [[Faliscans]] and, in the [[Renaissance]] and later, a fief of the [[House of Farnese|Farnese]] family.

The local produce is [[hazelnut]]s and [[wine]]. Annual [[Sagra (festival)|sagre]] include a live re-enactment of the birth of [[Jesus]] performed during [[Advent]].

In the summer, a park not far from the centre of the village stays open very late, and the town has several restaurants.

Doula Mouriki was born in 1934 at Ampelokepi (near [[Aigio]]). She earned degrees in history and archaeology in 1956 from the [[University of Athens]]. After studies at the Sorbonne, she returned to the University of Athens to earn a degree in French literature in 1958. She was hired by the [[National Archaeological Museum of Athens]] and was a research assistant in the [[Byzantine and Christian Museum]] from 1961 to 1965. She attended Princeton University, studying with [[Kurt Weitzmann]]. She earned her MFA in 1968 and her PhD in 1970.&lt;ref name="Dumbarton"/&gt; She was the first woman to earn a PhD from the University's Department of Art and Archaeology.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Books Received|journal=Princeton Alumni Weekly|date=February 9, 2000|volume=100|page=25|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=3iFbAAAAYAAJ&amp;lpg=PA231&amp;dq=%22doula%20mouriki%22&amp;pg=PA231#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

She studied thirteenth-century Cypriot icons and [[Palaeologan]] monument painting in Greece. She wrote many papers, including two papers on Georgian fresco cycles.

[[File:Abraham Dharma.png|thumb|right|300px|Distribution of Eastern religions today (yellow), as opposed to [[Abrahamic religions]] (purple).]]
The '''Eastern religions''' are the [[religion]]s originating in [[East Asia|East]], [[South Asia|South]] and [[Southeast Asia]] and thus having dissimilarities with [[Western religion]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |title=Eastern Religions: Origins, Beliefs, Practices, Holy Texts, Sacred Places |last1= Coogan |first1=Michael David |last2=Narayanan|first2=Vasudha|publisher=[[Oxford University Press]]  |year=2005 |isbn=0195221907}}&lt;/ref&gt; This includes the [[East Asian religions]] ([[Shintoism]], [[Korean Shamanism|Sindoism]], [[Taoism]] and [[Confucianism]]), [[Indian religions]] ([[Hinduism]], [[Buddhism]], [[Sikhism]] and [[Jainism]]) as well as [[animism|animistic]] [[indigenous religions]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |title=Readings in Eastern Religions|editor-last1=Coward |editor-first1=Harold G.|editor-last2=Neumaier-Dargyay |editor-first2=Eva K. |editor-last3=Neufeldt |editor-first3=Ronald|publisher=[[Wilfrid Laurier University Press]] |year=1988 |isbn=0889209553|page=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |title=World Religions: Eastern Traditions, Volume 2|last1=Gurdon Oxtoby |first1=Willard|publisher=[[Oxford University Press]] |year=1996 |isbn=0195407504}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This East-West religious distinction, just as with the [[East–West dichotomy|East-West]] culture distinction, and the implications that arise from it, is broad and not precise. Furthermore, the geographical distinction has less meaning in the current context of global [[transculturation]].

While many [[Western culture|Western]] observers attempt to distinguish between [[Eastern philosophies]] and religions, this is a distinction that does not exist in some Eastern traditions.&lt;ref&gt;Morgan (2001). Pp 9-11.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Indian religions==
[[File:Temple hindu1.jpg|thumb|170px|A [[Hindu]] temple in [[Sri Lanka]].]]
{{details|Indian religions}}
Religions originating in the [[Indian subcontinent]] include [[Hinduism]], [[Buddhism]], [[Jainism]], and [[Sikhism]].&lt;ref&gt;York (2005). Pg 166.&lt;/ref&gt; The theologies and philosophies of these religions have several concepts in common, such as ''[[dharma]]'', ''[[karma]]'', ''[[Maya (illusion)|maya]]'' and ''[[samsara]]''.

===Hinduism===
{{main|Hinduism}}
[[File:Golden Aum.png|thumb|left|140px|[[Om|OM]], a sacred syllable and a quintessential symbol of Hinduism]]
[[File:Museum für Indische Kunst Dahlem Berlin Mai 2006 036 2.jpg|right|thumb|130px|A 13th century [[Cambodia]]n statue of [[Vishnu]].]]
Hinduism originated on the Indian subcontinent. It is considered by some to be the world's oldest extant major religion. Hinduism contains a vast body of [[scripture]], divided as [[Śruti|revealed]] and [[smriti|remembered]], expounding on dharma, or religious living. Hindus consider the ''[[Vedas]]'' and the ''[[Upanishads]]'' as being among the foremost in authority, importance and antiquity. The ''[[Bhagavad Gita|{{IAST|Bhagavad Gītā}}]]'', a treatise excerpted from the ''{{IAST|Mahābhārata}}'', is sometimes called a summary of the spiritual teachings of the ''Vedas''. It is difficult to identify any universal belief or practice in Hinduism, although prominent themes include: ''[[Dharma]]'', ''[[Samsara]]'', ''[[Karma]]'', and ''[[Moksha]]''. Hinduism is sometimes called a [[polytheistic religion]], but this is an oversimplification. Hinduism includes a diverse collection of schools whose beliefs span [[monotheism]], [[polytheism]], [[pantheism]], [[monism]] and even [[Atheism in Hinduism|atheism]]. For instance, the [[Advaita Vedanta]] school holds that there is only one causal entity ([[Brahman]]), which manifests itself into all the various living and non-living forms that we observe, whereas traditions such as [[Vaishnavism]] and [[Shaivism]] worship [[Vishnu]] and [[Shiva]] in a relatively more monotheistic sense (caused by a differentiation between the [[parabrahman]] and [[Ātman (Hinduism)|atman]]). A number of scholars even consider the [[Samkhya]] school of thought to have atheistic leanings.&lt;ref&gt;Bhaskarananda (1994).&lt;br /&gt;Weightman (1997). Pg 263.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Buddhism===
[[File:Hong Kong Budha.jpg|thumb|130px|right|The [[Tian Tan Buddha]] statue in [[Hong Kong]].]]
{{main|Buddhism}}
Buddhism is a [[Nontheistic religions|nontheistic]] [[Indian religions|Indian religion]] and [[philosophy]]. Buddhism was founded around the 5th century [[BCE]] in [[India]] by [[Siddhartha Gautama]], the Buddha, with the [[Four Noble Truths]] and the [[Eightfold Path]] as its central principles. According to the scriptures, the Four Noble Truths were revealed by the [[Gautama Buddha|Buddha]] in his first sermon after attaining enlightenment. The schools of Buddhism are typically divided into [[Theravada]] and [[Mahayana]]. In academic circles, Mahayana is further divided into [[East Asian Buddhism|East Asian]] and [[Tibetan Buddhism]]. Buddhism teaches that someone who becomes [[bodhi|enlightened]] without instruction is a [[Buddhahood|buddha]]. The primary goal of Buddhism is the liberation of the practitioner from [[samsara]]. Buddhists hold this to be the solution to the problem of suffering.

===Jainism===
[[File:Jain Prateek Chihna.svg|thumb|130px|right|This is the holiest [[Jain symbol]].]]
{{main|Jainism}}
Jainism is the religion of the followers of [[Mahavira]]. He is said to be the 24th [[Tirthankara]], or the 24th in a line of teachers espousing Jain principles. Jains reject the [[Veda]]s and highlight the practice of austerity. Jain philosophy states that the [[jiva]], or soul, can escape the cycle of rebirth and death through strict ethical behavior. When nothing remains but the purity of the jiva, that person is called a ''jina'', or winner, which is the origin of the term Jain. [[Karma in Jainism|Karma]] is viewed as an accumulation that burdens the soul, causing attachment and suffering. [[Ahimsa]], or non-violence, is central to Jain faith, philosophy and practice. It is interpreted very strictly as prohibiting all forms of harm to other living beings. Due to this, Jainism requires a strict [[Jain vegetarianism|vegetarian]] lifestyle. ''Ahimsa'' also applies to speaking, as one's words can cause harm and suffering.&lt;ref&gt;Flood (1996). Pg 76.&lt;br /&gt;Fisher (1997). Pp 116-117.&lt;br /&gt;Rausch &amp; Key (1993).&lt;/ref&gt;

===Sikhism===
{{main|Sikhism}}
[[File:Khanda.svg|left|80px]]
Sikhism is a religion which began in Punjab of [[Northern India]]. It is founded on the teachings of [[Guru Nanak Dev]] and the nine human [[Sikh Gurus|gurus]] that followed. He received a vision to preach the way to enlightenment and God in Sultanpur. His views rejected the traditional worships and caste of the Hindu faith. &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.religioustolerance.org/sikhism.htm] Religions of the World Sikhism&lt;/ref&gt; Freedom from reincarnation is tied to remembrance and repetition on one universal God. God is formless and simultaneously in every form. Sikhs believe that there is one universal God who is the ultimate creator, sustainer, and destroyer. The [[Gurū Granth Sāhib]] are the central scriptures intended to preserve hymns and the teachings of the Sikh Gurus and other saints from Hindu and Sufi traditions. Rituals, religious ceremonies or empty worship are considered of little use and Sikhs are discouraged from fasting or going on pilgrimages. The tenets of Sikhism include (1) honest living/earning (2) tithing and giving alms (3) chanting on God. Sikhism also has a strong warrior tradition which arose in defense of religious freedom and human rights from a tyrannical [[Moghul]] occupation of India.

==East Asian religions==
{{Main|East Asian religions}}
The group of [[East Asia]]n religions or philosophies share the concept of [[Tao]]. They may be considered as forming a group within [[world religion]]s&lt;ref&gt;Sharot (2001). Pp 71-72, 75-76.&lt;/ref&gt; comparable to the [[Abrahamic religion|Abrahamic]] or [[Dharmic religion|Dharmic]] groups. The Taoic faiths claim at least 500 million members worldwide.&lt;ref&gt;[http://adherents.com/Religions_By_Adherents.html Religious population statistics]. These statistics are limited and do not reflect the full population of Taoic adherents due to complexities in definition and polling.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Taoism===
{{main|Taoism}}
Taoism, also known as Daoism, comprises a variety of related religious and philosophical traditions. Categorization of Taoist sects and movements is very controversial. Taoist propriety and ethics places an emphasis on the [[Three Jewels of the Tao]]; love, moderation, humility. Taoist theology focuses on doctrines of [[wu wei]] ("non-action"), spontaneity, [[humanism]], [[relativism]] and emptiness.&lt;ref&gt;Leaman (1999). Pg 111.&lt;br /&gt;Slingerland (2003).&lt;br /&gt;Sharot (2001). Pg 78.&lt;/ref&gt; 

Most traditional Chinese Taoists are polytheistic. There are disagreements regarding the proper composition of this pantheon. Popular Taoism typically presents the [[Jade Emperor]] as the head [[deity]]. Intellectual, or "elite", Taoism usually presents [[Laozi]] and the [[Three Pure Ones]] at the top of the pantheon. Nature and ancestor spirits are common in popular Taoism. But this sort of [[shamanism]] is eschewed for an emphasis on [[internal alchemy]] among the "elite" Taoists. Tao itself is rarely an object of worship, being treated more like the South Asian concept of [[wikt:atman|atman]].&lt;ref&gt;Segal (2006). Pg 50. Maspero (1981). Pg 41. LaFargue (1994). Pg 283.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Shinto===
[[File:Priest at Dazaifu Tenmagu shrine 1.JPG|right|thumb|140px|A Shinto priest kneeling before a shrine.]]
{{main|Shinto}}
Shinto is an animistic [[folk religion]] practiced in Japan. Shinto literally means "the way of the gods". Many Japanese Shintoists also identify themselves as Buddhists. Japanese [[Pure Land Buddhism]] is deeply intertwined with the Shinto faith. Shinto practitioners commonly affirm tradition, family, nature, cleanliness and ritual observation as core values. Taoic influence is significant in their beliefs about nature and self-mastery.&lt;ref&gt;Pilgrim (1999). Pg 1.&lt;br /&gt;Sharot (2001). Pp. 161-162.&lt;br /&gt;Ono (2004). Pp 97-99, 103-104.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Ritual cleanliness]] is a central part of Shinto life. [[Shrines]] have a significant place in Shintoism, reflecting the animistic veneration of the [[kami]]. "Folk", or "popular", Shinto places an emphasis on shamanism, particularly [[divination]], [[spirit possession]] and [[faith healing]]. "Sect" Shinto is a diverse group including mountain-worshippers and Confucian Shintoists.&lt;ref&gt;Ono (2004). Pp 12, 51-52, 108.&lt;br /&gt;Markham (2001). Pp 304-306.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Confucianism===
[[File:Confuciusstatue.jpg|thumb|left|150px|Statue of Confucius on Chongming Island in Shanghai]]
{{main|Confucianism}}
Confucianism is a complex system of moral, social and political thought, influential in the history of East Asia. It is debatable whether Confucianism is a religion or simply an ethical system. It is commonly associated with [[Legalism (Chinese philosophy)|legalism]] but it rejects legalism for [[ritualism]]. It also endorses [[meritocracy]] as the ideal of [[nobility]]. Confucianism has a complicated system governing duties and etiquette in relationships. Confucian ethics focus on familial duty, loyalty and humaneness.&lt;ref&gt;Smart (2000). Pp 66.&lt;br /&gt;Yao (2000). pp 191-192&lt;br /&gt;De Bary &amp; Tu (1998). Pg 149.&lt;/ref&gt; 

Confucianism tolerates the Chinese folk recognition of the existence of animistic spirits, [[ghosts]] and [[deities]]. It approves paying them proper respect, but at a more fundamental level encourages avoiding them. Confucian thought is notable as the framework upon which the syncretic [[Neo-Confucianism]] was built.&lt;ref&gt;Sharot (2001). Pp 46, 85.&lt;br /&gt;Huang (1999). Pg 5.&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Fiqh |width=19.0em}}
{{Islam |texts |width=19.75em}}

'''''Fiqh''''' ({{IPAc-en|f|iː|k}};&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.collinsdictionary.com/dictionary/english/fiqh "fiqh"]. ''[[Collins English Dictionary]]''.&lt;/ref&gt; {{lang-ar|{{large|فقه}}}} {{IPA-ar|fɪqh|}}) is [[Islam]]ic [[jurisprudence]].&lt;ref name="Fiqh"&gt;[http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/207723/fiqh Fiqh] Encyclopædia Britannica&lt;/ref&gt;  ''Fiqh'' is often described as the human understanding of the ''[[sharia]],''&lt;ref name=vogel&gt;{{cite book|last=Vogel|first=Frank E.|title=Islamic Law and the Legal System of Saudí: Studies of Saudi Arabia|date=2000|publisher=Brill|pages=4–5|url=https://books.google.com/?id=-PfDuvnHMGoC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=vogel+islamic+law#v=onepage&amp;q=vogel%20islamic%20law&amp;f=false|isbn=9004110623}}&lt;/ref&gt; that is human understanding of the divine Islamic law as revealed in the [[Quran]] and the ''[[Sunnah]]'' (the teachings and practices of the Islamic prophet [[Muhammad]]). Fiqh  expands and develops Shariah through interpretation (''[[ijtihad]]'') of the Quran and ''Sunnah'' by Islamic jurists (''[[ulama]]'')&lt;ref name=vogel/&gt; and is implemented by the rulings (''[[fatwa]]'') of jurists on questions presented to them. Thus, whereas ''sharia'' is considered immutable and infallible by Muslims, ''fiqh'' is considered fallible and changeable. ''Fiqh'' deals with the observance of rituals, morals and social legislation in Islam. In the modern era, there are four prominent schools (''[[madh'hab]]'') of ''fiqh'' within [[Sunni]] practice, plus two (or three) within [[Shi'a]] practice. A person trained in ''fiqh'' is known as a ''[[faqīh]]'' (plural ''fuqaha'').&lt;ref&gt;Glasse, Cyril, ''The New Encyclopedia of Islam'', Altamira, 2001, p. 141&lt;/ref&gt;

Figuratively, ''fiqh'' means knowledge about Islamic legal rulings from their sources and deriving religious rulings from their sources necessitates the ''[[mujtahid]]'' (an individual who exercises ''ijtihad'') to have a deep understanding in the different discussions of jurisprudence. A ''faqīh'' must look deep down into a matter and not suffice himself with just the apparent meaning, and a person who only knows the appearance of a matter is not qualified as a ''faqīh''.&lt;ref name="Fiqh"/&gt;

The studies of ''fiqh'', are traditionally divided into ''Uṣūl al-fiqh'' ([[principles of Islamic jurisprudence]], lit. the roots of fiqh), the methods of legal interpretation and analysis; and ''Furūʿ al-fiqh'' (lit. the branches of fiqh), the elaboration of rulings on the basis of these principles.{{sfn|Calder|2009}}{{sfn|Schneider|2014}} ''Furūʿ al-fiqh'' is the product of the application of ''Uṣūl al-fiqh'' and the total product of human efforts at understanding the divine will. A ''[[hukm]]'' (plural ''aḥkām'') is a particular ruling in a given case.

== Etymology ==
The word ''fiqh'' is an Arabic term meaning "deep understanding"&lt;ref name="Modarresi"&gt;{{cite book|author=Mohammad Taqi al-Modarresi|authorlink=Mohammad Taqi al-Modarresi|title=The Laws of Islam|date=26 March 2016|publisher=Enlight Press|isbn=978-0994240989|url=http://almodarresi.com/en/books/pdf/TheLawsofIslam.pdf|accessdate=22 December 2017|ref=Modarresi|language=English}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|470}} or "full comprehension". Technically it refers to the body of Islamic law extracted from detailed Islamic sources (which are studied in the [[principles of Islamic jurisprudence]]) and the process of gaining knowledge of Islam through jurisprudence. The historian [[Ibn Khaldun]] describes ''fiqh'' as "knowledge of the rules of God which concern the actions of persons who own themselves connected to obey the law respecting what is required (''[[wajib]]''), sinful (''[[haraam]]''), recommended (''[[mustahab|mandūb]]''), disapproved (''[[makrūh]]'') or neutral (''[[mubah]]'')".&lt;ref&gt;Levy (1957). p. 150.&lt;/ref&gt; This definition is consistent amongst the jurists.

In [[Modern Standard Arabic]], ''fiqh'' has come to mean jurisprudence in general, be it Islamic or secular. It is thus possible to speak of [[Chief Justice of the United States|Chief Justice]] [[John Roberts]] as an expert in the [[common law]] ''fiqh'' of the [[United States]], or of [[Egypt]]ian legal scholar [[Abd El-Razzak El-Sanhuri]] as an expert in the civil law ''fiqh'' of Egypt.

==History==
{{main article|Sharia}}
{{further information|Islamic economics in the world}}

The history of Islamic jurisprudence is "customarily divided into eight periods":&lt;ref name=MAEGIFLEP2006:30-1&gt;[[#MAEGIFLEP2006|El-Gamal, ''Islamic Finance'', 2006]]: pp. 30–31&lt;/ref&gt;
*the first period ending with the death of [[Muhammad]] in 11 AH.&lt;ref name=MAEGIFLEP2006:30-1/&gt;
*second period "characterized by personal interpretations" of the canon by the ''[[Sahabah]]'' or companions of Muhammad, lasting until 50 AH.&lt;ref name=MAEGIFLEP2006:30-1/&gt;
*from 50 AH until the early second century AH there was competition between a "a traditionalist approach to jurisprudence" in [[Hijaz|western Arabia]] where Islam was revealed and a "rationalist approach in Iraq".&lt;ref name=MAEGIFLEP2006:30-1/&gt;
*the "golden age of classical Islamic jurisprudence" from the "early second to the mid-fourth century when the [[Madhhab#Amman Message|eight "most significant"]] schools of Sunni and [[Shia|Shi'i]] jurisprudence emerged."&lt;ref name=MAEGIFLEP2006:30-1/&gt;
*from the mid-fourth century to mid-seventh AH Islamic jurisprudence was "limited to elaborations within the main juristic schools".&lt;ref name=MAEGIFLEP2006:30-1/&gt;
*the "dark age" of Islamic jurisprudence stretched from the [[Siege of Baghdad (1258)|fall of Baghdad]] in the mid-seventh AH (1258 CE) to 1293 AH/1876 CE.
*In 1293 AH (1876 CE) the Ottomans codified [[Hanafi]] jurisprudence in the ''[[Mecelle|Majallah el-Ahkam-i-Adliya]]''. Several "juristic revival movements" influenced by "exposure to Western legal and technological progress"  followed until the mid-20th century CE. [[Muhammad Abduh]] and [[Abd El-Razzak El-Sanhuri]] were products of this era.&lt;ref name=MAEGIFLEP2006:30-1/&gt;
*The most recent era has been that of the "[[Islamic revival#Contemporary revivalism|Islamic revival]]", which has been "predicated on rejection of Western social and legal advances" and the development of specifically Islamic states, social sciences, economics, and finance.&lt;ref name=MAEGIFLEP2006:30-1/&gt;
The formative period of Islamic jurisprudence stretches back to the time of the early Muslim communities. In this period, jurists were more concerned with issues of authority and teaching than with theory and methodology.&lt;ref name="Weiss (2002)"&gt;Weiss, Bernard G. (2002).

Progress in theory and methodology happened with the coming of the early Muslim jurist [[Muhammad ibn Idris ash-Shafi`i]] (767–820), who codified the basic principles of Islamic jurisprudence in his book ''ar-Risālah''. The book details the four roots of law ([[Qur'an]], [[Sunnah]], ''[[ijma]]'', and ''[[qiyas]]'') while specifying that the primary Islamic texts (the Qur'an and the hadith) be understood according to objective rules of interpretation derived from scientific study of the Arabic language.&lt;ref name=weiss-162&gt;Weiss, Bernard G. (2002). ''Studies in Islamic Legal Theory'', edited by Bernard G. Weiss, (Leiden: E. J. Brill, 2002. p. 162.)&lt;/ref&gt;

Secondary sources of law were developed and refined over the subsequent centuries, consisting primarily of juristic preference (''[[istihsan]]''), laws of the previous prophets (''[[shara man qablana]]''), continuity (''[[istishab]]''), extended analogy (''[[maslaha mursala]]''), blocking the means (''[[sadd al-dhari'ah]]''), custome ''[[urf]]'' and saying of a companion (''[[qawl al-sahabi]]'').&lt;ref name="Nyazee (2000)"&gt;Nyazee, Imran Ahsan Khan (2000).

The Quran set the rights, the responsibilities and the rules for people and for societies to adhere to, like not dealing in interest. Muhammad then provided an example, which is recorded in the hadith books, showing people how he practically implemented these rules in a society. After the passing of [[Muhammad]], there was a need for jurists, to decide on new legal matters where there is no such ruling in the Quran or the Hadith, example of [[Islamic prophet]] [[Muhammad]] regarding a similar case.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=gMxjJqurmiAC&amp;pg=PA30&amp;dq=development+of+schools+of+thought+hanifa&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=vvMMUe7WLs62hAevmIBw&amp;ved=0CC4Q6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=development%20of%20schools%20of%20thought%20hanifa&amp;f=false|title=Islam Vs.

In the years proceeding Muhammad, the community in Madina continued to use the same rules. People were familiar with the practice of Muhammad and therefore continued to use the same rules.

The scholars appearing in the diagram below were taught by [[Muhammad's companions]], many of whom settled in Madina.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://bewley.virtualave.net/ulama.html|title=ulama|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Muwatta Imam Malik|Muwatta]]&lt;ref name="bewley.virtualave.net"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://bewley.virtualave.net/muwcont.html|title=Muwatta|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; by [[Malik ibn Anas]] was written as a consensus of the opinion, of these scholars.&lt;ref name="Coulson"&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=d5Ks31qHlSYC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=coulson+history+islamic+law&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=QVA59sVI8G&amp;sig=stT7OrQHTIkIJ6mgK5-kQzT0gAg&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=durLTOa5KI_QjAe06rnYBw&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=3&amp;ved=0CCkQ6AEwAg#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|title=A History of Islamic Law|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Va6oSxzojzoC&amp;pg=PA207&amp;dq=Muwatta+consensus+of+the+opinions+scholars&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=vqQLUaSqMKy20QXX1YHwDA&amp;ved=0CC4Q6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=Muwatta%20consensus%20of%20the%20opinions%20scholars&amp;f=false|title=E.

Much of the knowledge we have about Muhammad is narrated through [[Aisha]] the wife of Muhammad, also a renowned scholar of her time. Aisha raised and taught her nephew [[Qasim ibn Muhammad ibn Abu Bakr]] after her brother [[Muhammad ibn Abu Bakr]] was killed by the Syrians.

Qasim ibn Muhammad ibn Abu Bakr's mother was from Ali's family and Qasim's daughter [[Farwah bint al-Qasim]] was married to [[Muhammad al-Baqir]] and was the mother of [[Jafar al-Sadiq]]. Therefore, Qasim ibn Muhammad ibn Abu Bakr was the grandson of [[Abu Bakr]] the first caliph and the grandfather of Jafar al-Sadiq whose views the twelver Shias follow. The twelver Shia do not accept Abu Bakr as the first caliph but do accept his great-great-grandson Jafar al-Sadiq.

Aisha also taught her nephew [[Urwah ibn Zubayr]]. He then taught his son [[Hisham ibn Urwah]], who was the main teacher of [[Malik ibn Anas]] whose views many Sunni follow and also taught Jafar al-Sadiq. Qasim ibn Muhammad ibn Abu Bakr, Hisham ibn Urwah and Muhammad al-Baqir taught [[Zayd ibn Ali]], Jafar al-Sadiq, [[Abu Hanifa]], and Malik ibn Anas.

Imam Jafar al-Sadiq, Imam Abu Hanifa and Malik ibn Anas worked together in [[Al-Masjid an-Nabawi]] in Medina. Along with Qasim ibn Muhammad ibn Abu Bakr, Muhammad al-Baqir, Zayd ibn Ali and over 70 other leading jurists and scholars.

[[Al-Shafi‘i]] was taught by Malik ibn Anas. [[Ahmad ibn Hanbal]] was taught by Al-Shafi‘i. [[Muhammad al-Bukhari]] travelled everywhere collecting hadith and his father [[Ismail ibn Ibrahim]] was a student of Malik ibn Anas.&lt;ref name="Islam Page 67"&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=mlGgGVCp0UcC&amp;pg=PA67&amp;dq=aisha+and+qasim+ibn+muhammad&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=fwQpUfqMBYi80QXqs4GoAw&amp;ved=0CEcQ6AEwBA#v=onepage&amp;q=aisha%20and%20qasim%20ibn%20muhammad&amp;f=false|title=Understanding Women in Islam|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=JdjtUTYSL1UC&amp;pg=PA37&amp;dq=aisha+and+qasim+ibn+muhammad&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=fwQpUfqMBYi80QXqs4GoAw&amp;ved=0CEwQ6AEwBQ#v=onepage&amp;q=aisha%20and%20qasim%20ibn%20muhammad&amp;f=false|title=Classical Islam|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=GlqeC1ZFAUEC&amp;pg=PT101&amp;dq=aisha+and+qasim&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=gwMpUebmBuTC0QXL2ID4CQ&amp;ved=0CDEQ6AEwAA|title=Judaism and Islam in Practice|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.oocities.org/mutmainaa7/people/jafar_al_sadiq.html|title=Jafar Al-Sadiq|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ziaraat.org/jafar.php|title=IMAM JAFAR BIN MUHAMMAD AS-SADIQ (AS)|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Islam scholars diagram}}

In the books actually written by these original jurists and scholars, there are very few theological and judicial differences between them. Imam Ahmad rejected the writing down and codifying of the religious rulings he gave. They knew that they might have fallen into error in some of their judgements and stated this clearly. They never introduced their rulings by saying, "Here, this judgement is the judgement of God and His prophet."&lt;ref name="books.google.co.uk"&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=W4OKaz5dzdYC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=Modernist+Islam,+1840-1940:+A+Sourcebook+By+Charles+Kurzman&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=rYP-UKSOC4m70QXR54HYDA&amp;ved=0CDcQ6AEwAA|title=Modernist Islam, 1840–1940|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; There is also very little text actually written down by [[Jafar al-Sadiq]] himself. They all give priority to the Qur'an and the Hadith (the practice of Muhammad). They felt that the Quran and the Hadith, the example of Muhammad provided people with almost everything they needed. "This day I have perfected for you your religion and completed My favor upon you and have approved for you Islam as religion" Quran 5:3.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://quran.com/5/3 |title=Surat Al-Ma'idah [5:3] - The Noble Qur'an - القرآن الكريم |publisher= |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130925005700/http://quran.com/5/3 |archivedate=25 September 2013 |df=dmy }} [http://irebd.com/quran/english/surah-5/verse-3/ Quran Surah Al-Maaida ( Verse 3 )]&lt;/ref&gt;

These scholars did not distinguish between each other. They were not Sunni or Shia. They felt that they were following the religion of Abraham as described in the Quran "Say: Allah speaks the truth; so follow the religion of Abraham, the upright one. And he was not one of the polytheists" (Qur'an 3:95).

Most of the differences are regarding Sharia laws devised through [[Ijtihad]] where there is no such ruling in the Quran or the Hadiths of [[Islamic prophet]] [[Muhammad]] regarding a similar case.&lt;ref name="books.google.co.uk"/&gt; As these jurists went to new areas, they were pragmatic and continued to use the same ruling as was given in that area during pre-Islamic times, if the population felt comfortable with it, it was just and they used [[Ijtihad]] to deduce that it did not conflict with the Quran or the Hadith. As explained in the [[Muwatta Imam Malik|Muwatta]]&lt;ref name="bewley.virtualave.net"/&gt; by [[Malik ibn Anas]].&lt;ref name="Coulson"/&gt; This made it easier for the different communities to integrate into the Islamic State and assisted in the quick expansion of the Islamic State.

To reduce the divergence, [[ash-Shafi'i]] proposed giving priority to the Qur'an and the Hadith (the practice of Muhammad) and only then look at the consensus of the Muslim jurists (''[[ijma]]'') and analogical reasoning (''[[qiyas]]'').&lt;ref name="Coulson"/&gt; This then resulted in jurists like [[Muhammad al-Bukhari]]&lt;ref name="sahih-bukhari.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sahih-bukhari.com/|title=Sahih Bukhari : Read, Study, Search Online|first=Sahih|last=Bukhari|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; dedicating their lives to the collection of the correct Hadith, in books like [[Sahih al-Bukhari]]. Sahih translates as authentic or correct. They also felt that Muhammad's judgement was more impartial and better than their own.

These original jurists and scholars also acted as a counterbalance to the rulers. When they saw injustice, all these scholars spoke out against it. As the state expanded outside Madina, the rights of the different communities, as they were constituted in the [[Constitution of Medina]] still applied. The Quran also gave additional rights to the citizens of the state and these rights were also applied. Ali, Hassan and [[Hussein ibn Ali]] gave their allegiance to the first three caliphs because they abided by these conditions. Later [[Ali]] the fourth caliph wrote in a letter "I did not approach the people to get their oath of allegiance but they came to me with their desire to make me their Amir (ruler). I did not extend my hands towards them so that they might swear the oath of allegiance to me but they themselves extended their hands towards me".&lt;ref&gt;Nahj ul Balagha Letter 54&lt;/ref&gt; But later as fate would have it ([[Predestination in Islam]]) when [[Yazid I]], an oppressive ruler took power, Hussein ibn Ali the grandson of [[Muhammad]] felt that it was a test from God for him and his duty to confront him. Then [[Abd Allah ibn al-Zubayr]], [[Qasim ibn Muhammad ibn Abu Bakr]]'s cousin confronted the [[Umayyad]] rulers after Hussein ibn Ali was betrayed by the people of Kufa and killed by Syrian Roman Army now under the control of the [[Yazid I]] the Umayyad ruler.&lt;ref&gt;Najeebabadi, Akbar Shah (2001). The History of Islam V.2. Riyadh: Darussalam. p. 110. {{ISBN|9960-892-88-3}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Abd Allah ibn al-Zubayr then took on the Umayyads and expelled their forces from Hijaz and Iraq. But then his forces were depleted in Iraq, trying to stop the Khawarij. The Ummayads then moved in. After a lengthy campaign, in his last hour Abd Allah ibn al-Zubayr asked his mother [[Asma' bint Abu Bakr]] the daughter of [[Abu Bakr]] the first caliph for advice. Asma' bint Abu Bakr replied to her son, she said:&lt;ref name="ummah.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ummah.com/forum/showthread.php?347728-The-Advice-of-Asmaa-bint-Abu-Bakr-(ra)-to-her-son-Abdullah-Ibn-Zubair-(ra)|title=The Advice of Asmaa bint Abu Bakr (ra) to her son Abdullah Ibn Zubair (ra)|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; "You know better in your own self, that if you are upon the truth and you are calling towards the truth go forth, for people more honourable than you have been killed and if you are not upon the truth, then what an evil son you are and you have destroyed yourself and those who are with you. If you say, that if you are upon the truth and you will be killed at the hands of others, then you will not truly be free". Abd Allah ibn al-Zubayr left and was later also killed and crucified by the Syrian Roman Army now under the control of the Umayyads and led by Hajjaj. [[Muhammad ibn Abi Bakr]] the son of [[Abu Bakr]] the first caliph and raised by [[Ali]] the fourth caliph was also killed by the [[Ummayad]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Nahj al-Balagha Sermon 71, Letter 27, Letter 34, Letter 35&lt;/ref&gt; [[Aisha]] then raised and taught his son Qasim ibn Muhammad ibn Abu Bakr who later taught his grandson [[Jafar al-Sadiq]].

During the early Ummayad period, there was more community involvement. The Quran and Muhammad's example was the main source of law after which the community decided. If it worked for the community, was just and did not conflict with the Quran and the example of Muhammad, it was accepted. This made it easier for the different communities, with Roman, Persian, Central Asia and North African backgrounds to integrate into the Islamic State and that assisted in the quick expansion of the Islamic State. The scholars in Madina were consulted on the more complex judicial issues. The Sharia and the official more centralized schools of fiqh developed later, during the time of the Abbasids.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"&gt;Muawiya Restorer of the Muslim Faith By Aisha Bewley p. 68&lt;/ref&gt;

The sources of ''fiqh'' in order of importance are
#the [[Qur'an]]
#[[Hadith]]
#[[Ijma]], i.e. collective reasoning and consensus amongst authoritative Muslims of a particular generation, and its interpretation by Islamic scholars.
#[[Qiyas]], i.e. analogy which is deployed if ''Ijma'' or historic collective reasoning on the issue is not available.&lt;ref name="overview"&gt;{{cite book|editor1-first=Hisham M. |editor1-last=Ramadan|author1=Irshad Abdel Haqq|authorlink1=Islamic law: An Overview of Its Origins and Elements|title=Understanding Islamic Law: From Classical to Contemporary|publisher=Rowman Altamira|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=5ZS7EaHTQX8C&amp;pg=PA1&amp;dq=Islamic+law:+An+Overview+of+Its+Origins+and+Elements&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwioosO24cnOAhXGNSYKHQImBCgQ6AEIHjAA#v=onepage&amp;q=Islamic%20law%3A%20An%20Overview%20of%20Its%20Origins%20and%20Elements&amp;f=false |accessdate=17 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The [[Qur'an]] gives clear instructions on many issues, such as how to perform the ritual purification (''{{lang|ar|[[wudu]]}}'') before the obligatory daily prayers (''{{lang|ar|[[salat]]}}''), but on other issues, some Muslims believe the Qur'an alone is not enough to make things clear. For example, the Qur'an states one needs to engage in daily prayers (''{{lang|ar|[[salat]]}}'') and fast (''{{lang|ar|[[sawm]]}}'') during the [[Ramadan (calendar month)|month of Ramadan]] but Muslims believe they need further instructions on how to perform these duties. Details about these issues can be found in the traditions of Muhammad, so [[Qur'an and Sunnah]] are in most cases the basis for (''{{lang|ar|[[Shariah]]}}'').

Some topics are without precedent in Islam's early period. In those cases, Muslim jurists (''{{lang|ar|[[Fuqaha]]}}'') try to arrive at conclusions by other means. [[Sunni]] jurists use historical consensus of the community (''{{lang|ar|[[Ijma]]}}''); a majority in the modern era also use [[analogy]] (''{{lang|ar|[[Qiyas]]}}'') and weigh the harms and benefits of new topics (''{{lang|ar|[[Istislah]]}}''), and a plurality utilizes juristic preference (''{{lang|ar|[[Istihsan]]}}''). The conclusions arrived at with the aid of these additional tools constitute a wider array of laws than the Sharia consists of, and is called '''fiqh'''. Thus, in contrast to the ''sharia'', ''fiqh'' is not regarded as [[sacred]] and the schools of thought have differing views on its details, without viewing other conclusions as [[Sacrilege|sacrilegious]]. This division of interpretation in more detailed issues has resulted in different schools of thought (''{{lang|ar|[[madh'hab]]}}'').

This wider concept of '''Islamic jurisprudence''' is the source of a range of laws in different topics that guide Muslims in everyday life.

=== Component categories ===

Islamic jurisprudence (''fiqh'') covers two main areas:
# Rules in relation to actions, and,
# Rules in relation to circumstances surrounding actions.

These types of rules can also fall into two groups:
# Worship ([[Ibadah|Ibadaat]])
# Dealings and transactions (with people) ([[Muamalat|Mu`amalaat]])

Rules in relation to actions ('''amaliyya'' — عملية) or "[[Ahkam|decision types]]" comprise:
# Obligation (''[[fardh]]'')
# Recommendation (''[[mustahabb]]'')
# Permissibility (''[[mubah]]'')
# Disrecommendation (''[[makrooh]]'')
# Prohibition (''[[haraam]]'')

Rules in relation to circumstances (''wadia''') comprise:
# Condition (''shart'')
# Cause (''sabab'')
# Preventor (''mani'')
# Permit / Enforced (''rukhsah, azeemah'')
# Valid / Corrupt / Invalid (''sahih, fasid, batil'')
# In time / Deferred / Repeat (''adaa, qadaa, i'ada'')

=== Methodologies of jurisprudence ===
{{main article|Usul al-fiqh}}

The [[modus operandi]] of the Muslim jurist is known as ''[[usul al-fiqh]]'' ("principles of jurisprudence").

There are different approaches to the methodology used in jurisprudence to derive Islamic law from the primary sources. The main methodologies are those of the [[Sunni]], [[Shi'a]] and [[Ibadi]] denominations. While both Sunni and [[Shi'ite]] (Shia) are divided into smaller sub-schools, the differences among the Shi'ite schools is considerably greater. Ibadites only follow a single school without divisions.

;Fatawa
While using court decisions as legal precedents and [[case law]] are central to Western law, the importance of the institution of fatawa (non-binding answers by Islamic legal scholars to legal questions) has been called "central to the development" of Islamic jurisprudence.&lt;ref name=MAEGIFLEP2006:32&gt;[[#MAEGIFLEP2006|El-Gamal, ''Islamic Finance'', 2006]]: p. 32&lt;/ref&gt;  This is in part because of a "vacuum" in the other source of Islamic law, ''qada`'' (legal rulings by state appointed Islamic judges) after the fall of the last [[caliphate]] the Ottoman Empire.&lt;ref name=MAEGIFLEP2006:30-1/&gt; While the practice in Islam dates back to the time of Muhammad, according to at least one source (Muhammad El-Gamal), it is "modeled after the [[Roman Empire|Roman]] system of ''[[responsa]]''," and gives the questioner "decisive primary-mover advantage in choosing he question and its wording."&lt;ref name=MAEGIFLEP2006:30-1/&gt;

;Arguments for and against reform
Each school (''[[madhhab]]'') reflects a unique ''[[al-urf]]'' or culture (a cultural practice that was influenced by traditions), that the classical jurists themselves lived in, when rulings were made. Some suggest that the discipline of ''[[isnad]]'', which developed to validate ''hadith'' made it relatively easy to record and validate also the rulings of jurists. This, in turn, made them far easier to imitate (''[[taqlid]]'') than to challenge in new contexts. The argument is, the schools have been more or less frozen for centuries, and reflect a culture that simply no longer exists. Traditional scholars hold that religion is there to regulate human behavior and nurture people's moral side and since human nature has not fundamentally changed since the beginning of Islam a call to modernize the religion is essentially one to relax all laws and institutions.

Early ''[[shariah]]'' had a much more flexible character, and some modern Muslim scholars believe that it should be renewed, and that the classical jurists should lose special status.  This would require formulating a new fiqh suitable for the modern world, e.g. as proposed by advocates of the [[Islamization of knowledge]], which would deal with the modern context. This modernization is opposed by most conservative ''[[ulema]]''. Traditional scholars hold that the laws are contextual and consider circumstance such as time, place and culture, the principles they are based upon are universal such as justice, equality and respect. Many Muslim scholars argue that even though technology may have advanced, the fundamentals of human life have not.

{{Main article|Madhhab}}
There are several [[Madhhab|schools of fiqh thought]] ({{lang-ar|مذهب}} ''{{transl|ar|DIN|maḏhab}}''; pl. {{lang|ar|مذاهب}} ''{{transl|ar|DIN|maḏāhib}}'')
[[File:Madhhab Map3.png|thumb|650px|Map of the Muslim world with the main [[madh'hab]]s.]]
The schools of [[Sunnite|Sunni]] Islam are each named by students of the classical jurist who taught them.  The [[Sunni]] schools (and where they are commonly found) are
*[[Hanafi]] ([[Turkey]], [[the Balkans]], [[Central Asia]], [[Indian subcontinent]], [[China]] and [[Egypt]])
*[[Maliki]] ([[North Africa]], [[West Africa]] and several of the [[Arab states of the Persian Gulf]])
*[[Shafi'i]] ([[Kurdistan]], [[Indonesia]], [[Malaysia]], Egypt, [[East Africa]], [[Yemen]], and southern parts of [[India]])
*[[Hanbali]] ([[Saudi Arabia]]) see [[Wahhabism]]
*[[Zahiri]] (minority communities in [[Morocco]] and [[Pakistan]])
*[[Qurtubi]] No longer exists
*[[Laythi]] No longer exists but there are a few texts left of it.

The schools of [[Shia]] Islam comprise:
*[[Ja'fari]] ([[Twelver|Twelver Shia]]: [[Iran]], [[Iraq]], [[Lebanon]], etc.)
*[[Zaydi]] ([[Yemen]])

Entirely separate from both the Sunni and Shia traditions, [[Khawarij]] Islam has evolved its own distinct school.
*[[Ibadi]] ([[Oman]])

These schools share many of their rulings, but differ on the particular [[hadith]]s they accept as authentic and the weight they give to analogy or reason ([[qiyas]]) in deciding difficulties.

The relationship between (at least the Sunni) schools of jurisprudence and the conflict between the unity of the Shariah and the diversity of the schools, was expressed by the 12th century Hanafi scholar [[Abu Hafs Umar an-Nasafi]], who wrote: `Our school is correct with the possibility of error, and another school is in error with the possibility of being correct.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1 = Brown|first1 = Jonathan A.C.|authorlink=Jonathan A.C.

{{main article|Sharia#Classic Islamic law|l1=Sharia: Classic Islamic law}}

A number of important legal [[institution]]s were developed by Muslim jurists during the classical period of Islam, known as the [[Islamic Golden Age]]. One such institution was the ''[[Hawala]]'', an early [[informal value transfer system]], which is mentioned in texts of Islamic jurisprudence as early as the 8th century. ''Hawala'' itself later influenced the development of the [[Agency (law)|agency]] in [[common law]] and in [[Civil law (legal system)|civil laws]] such as the ''aval'' in [[Law of France|French law]] and the ''avallo'' in [[Italy|Italian]] law.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Islamic Law: Its Relation to Other Legal Systems |first=Gamal Moursi |last=Badr |journal=The American Journal of Comparative Law |volume=26 |issue=2 – Proceedings of an International Conference on Comparative Law, Salt Lake City, Utah, 24–25 February 1977 |date=Spring 1978 |pages=187–198 [196–98] |doi=10.2307/839667 |publisher=American Society of Comparative Law |ref=harv |postscript=&lt;!--None--&gt; |jstor=839667}}&lt;/ref&gt; The "European [[Limited partnership|commenda]]" (Islamic ''[[Qirad]]'') used in European civil law may have also originated from Islamic law.&lt;ref name=Makdisi/&gt;

The ''[[Waqf]]'' in [[Sharia|Islamic law]], which developed during the 7th–9th centuries, bears a notable resemblance to the [[Charitable trust|trusts]] in the English [[trust law]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Gaudiosi|1988}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, every ''Waqf'' was required to have a ''waqif'' (settlor), ''mutawillis'' (trustee), ''[[qadi]]'' (judge) and beneficiaries.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Gaudiosi|1988|pp=1237–40}}&lt;/ref&gt; The trust law developed in [[England]] at the time of the [[Crusades]], during the 12th and 13th centuries, was introduced by Crusaders who may have been influenced by the ''Waqf'' institutions they came across in the [[Middle East]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Hudson|2003|p=32}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Gaudiosi|1988|pp=1244–45}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Islamic ''lafif'' was a body of twelve members drawn from the [[neighbourhood]] and sworn to tell the truth, who were bound to give a unanimous [[verdict]], about matters "which they had personally seen or heard, binding on the [[Qadi|judge]], to settle the truth concerning facts in a case, between ordinary people, and obtained as of right by the [[plaintiff]]." The only characteristic of the English jury which the Islamic ''lafif'' lacked was the "judicial [[writ]] directing the jury to be summoned and directing the [[bailiff]] to hear its recognition." According to Professor John Makdisi, "no other institution in any legal institution studied to date shares all of these characteristics with the English jury." It is thus likely that the concept of the ''lafif'' may have been introduced to [[England]] by the [[Normans]], who [[Norman conquest of England|conquered both England]] and the [[Emirate of Sicily]], and then evolved into the modern English jury.&lt;ref name=Makdisi&gt;{{Harvnb|Makdisi|1999}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Several other fundamental [[common law]] institutions may have been adapted from similar legal institutions in [[Sharia|Islamic law]] and jurisprudence, and introduced to England by the [[Normans]] after the [[Norman conquest of England]] and the Emirate of Sicily, and by Crusaders during the [[Crusades]]. In particular, the "royal English [[contract]] protected by the action of [[debt]] is identified with the Islamic ''Aqd'', the English [[assize of novel disseisin]] is identified with the Islamic ''Istihqaq'', and the English [[jury]] is identified with the Islamic ''lafif''." Other English legal institutions such as "the [[scholastic method]], the [[licence]] to [[Education|teach]]", the "[[law school]]s known as [[Inns of Court]] in England and ''[[Madrasah|Madrasas]]'' in Islam" and the "European [[Limited partnership|commenda]]" (Islamic ''[[Qirad]]'') may have also originated from Islamic law.&lt;ref name=Makdisi/&gt; The methodology of [[Precedent|legal precedent]] and reasoning by [[analogy]] (''[[Qiyas]]'') are also similar in both the Islamic and common law systems.&lt;ref name=Gamal&gt;{{cite book |title=Islamic Finance: Law, Economics, and Practice |first=Mahmoud A. |last=El-Gamal |year=2006 |publisher=[[Cambridge University Press]] |isbn=0-521-86414-3 |page=16 |ref=harv |postscript=&lt;!--None--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt; These influences have led some scholars to suggest that Islamic law may have laid the foundations for "the common law as an integrated whole".&lt;ref name=Makdisi/&gt;

The '''Fowler Museum at UCLA''', or more commonly, '''The Fowler''', is a museum on the campus of the [[University of California, Los Angeles]] (UCLA) which explores art and material culture primarily from [[Africa]], [[Asia]] and the Pacific, and the Americas, past and present.

The Fowler is generally home to three to six art exhibitions and also acts as a venue for lectures on cultural topics, musical performances, art workshops, family programs, festivals and more. The Fowler is located in the northern part of UCLA's Westwood Campus, adjacent to [[Royce Hall]] and [[Glorya Kaufman Hall]].

The museum is operated under the jurisdiction of [[UCLA School of the Arts and Architecture]] (UCLA Arts).

==History==
[[File:Fowler Museum Construction stg extracted.jpg|thumb|left|Fowler Museum Plan by Savrann]]
[[File:Fowler Museum Construction stg2.jpg|thumb|left|Fowler Museum under Construction]]The museum was established in 1963 by then UCLA Chancellor [[Franklin D. Murphy]] as the Museum and Laboratories of Ethnic Arts and Technology.&lt;ref name="meaninglost"&gt;{{cite news|last=Muchnic|first=Suzanne|url=http://articles.latimes.com/2006/aug/27/entertainment/ca-artsnotes27.1 |newspaper=Los Angeles Times|date=August 27, 2006|title=ARTS NOTES Meaning lost, name changes}}&lt;/ref&gt; Its first home was in the basement of Haines Hall on the UCLA campus. The goal of this new museum was to consolidate the various collections of non-Western art and artifacts on campus. In addition to active collecting, the museum initiated research projects, fieldwork, exhibitions and publications.

In 1971 the name was changed to the Museum of Cultural History and by 1975 its collections, in numbers and in quality, ranked it among the top four university museums in the country, a stature it retains to the present day.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Dundjerski|first1=Marina|title=UCLA : The First Century|date=2011|publisher=UCLA Alumni, UCLA History Project|location=Los Angeles|isbn=9781906507374|page=153|edition=Third}}&lt;!--|accessdate=3 July 2014--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; 

In 1981, Chancellor [[Charles E. Young]], along with museum director, [[Christopher B. Donnan]], developed a vision for a new building that would fully exhibit the immense collection. The $22-million structure, designed by architects Arnold C. Savrann and [[John Carl Warnecke]], was funded by both private gifts and state resources.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author1=UCLA Alumni|authorlink1=UCLA Alumni|title=Sept. 30, 1992 Gallery of World Arts Unveiled|url=http://alumni.ucla.edu/share/ucla-history/tmih-sep-fowler.aspx|website=UCLA History|publisher=UCLA Alumni|accessdate=3 July 2014|location=Los Angeles, CA}}&lt;/ref&gt; The large facility called the Fowler Museum of Cultural History opened on September 30, 1992,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Muchnic|first=Suzanne|url=http://articles.latimes.com/1992-09-27/entertainment/ca-60_1_fowler-museum/|newspaper=Los Angeles Times|date=September 27, 1992 |title=Go (Anywhere But) West : UCLA's Fowler Museum of Cultural History, dedicated to non-Western traditions, opens 29 years after being conceived}}&lt;/ref&gt; named in recognition of lead support by the Fowler Foundation and the family of collector and inventor Francis E. Fowler Jr.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Poundstone|first=William|url=http://blogs.artinfo.com/lacmonfire/2013/10/28/francis-fowlers-museum-at-ucla/|newspaper=Blouin Art Info|date=October 28, 2013|title=Francis Fowler's Museum at UCLA}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In 2006 the name of the Museum was formally changed to the Fowler Museum at UCLA.&lt;ref name="meaninglost" /&gt;

===Fowler at Fifty===
In the fall of 2013, the Museum launched its fiftieth anniversary celebration with a night of festivities and the opening of eight special exhibitions from its global collections. The eight exhibitions, which ran through winter and spring of 2014, were:
*From the [[Sepik River]] to Los Angeles: Art in Migration
*Double Fortune, Double Trouble: Art for Twins among the Yorùbá
*Powerful Bodies: [[Zulu people|Zulu]] Arts of Personal Adornment
*[[Māori people|Māori]] Cloaks, Māori Voices
*The Peruvian Four-Selvaged Cloth: Ancient Threads/New Directions
*New World [[Wunderkammer]]: A Project by [[Amalia Mesa-Bains]]
*Chupícuaro: The [[Natalie Wood]] Gift of Ancient Mexican Ceramics
*From X to Why: A Museum Takes Shape
In addition to these exhibitions, the Fowler also exhibited new and promised gifts of art inside the rotating '''Fowler in Focus''' gallery, and presented ''Walk among Worlds'', an installation by artist Máximo González composed of thousands of beach ball globes.

==Collections==
The Fowler's collections comprise more than 120,000 art and ethnographic and 600,000 archaeological objects representing ancient, traditional, and contemporary cultures of Africa, Native and Latin America, and Asia and the Pacific. From [[Yoruba people|Yoruba]] beaded arts of Southern Nigeria, to pre-Columbian ceramic vessels of Peru, to elaborate [[Batik|batik textiles]] of Indonesia and the vibrant papier-mâché sculptures of Mexico, the Fowler's collections offer a comprehensive resource for exhibitions and scholarship central to the Museum's mandate.
&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Muchnic|first=Suzanne|url=http://articles.latimes.com/2013/sep/28/entertainment/la-et-cm-ucla-fowler-museum-50-20130929|newspaper=Los Angeles Times|date=September 28, 2013 |title=UCLA's Fowler Museum turns 50 in worldly fashion}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The majority of the Museum's holdings has been acquired via the generosity of individuals—researchers, scholars, and dedicated collectors—who have enabled the Fowler to build its world-class collections. The Sir Henry Wellcome Collection of 30,000 objects,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Hasinoff |first=Erin L.|date=November 2011 |title=An Infinity of Things: How Sir Henry Wellcome Collected the World.

More than 15,000 textiles trace the history of cloth over two millennia and across five continents.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Muchnic |first=Suzanne |url=http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/arts/la-et-collect11-2009feb11-story.html |date=February 11, 2009|newspaper=Los Angeles Times|title=L.A. museums' collections grow despite poor economy}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:Francis Fowler Silver Collection at UCLA.jpg|thumb|right|Fowler Family Silver Collection]] --&gt;

Objects from the Fowler Family Silver Collection include 400 works representing 16th- through 19th-century Europe and the United States. Among these are vessels from the renowned workshops of [[Paul de Lamerie]], [[Karl Fabergé]], and [[Paul Revere]]. In 1969, Hollywood actress [[Natalie Wood]] donated a remarkable collection of ancient [[Chupícuaro]] Mexican ceramics to the Fowler Museum.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Green|first1=Natalie|title=Q&amp;A: Victoria Lyall discusses Chupícuaro pottery, upcoming Fowler lecture|url=http://dailybruin.com/2014/01/09/qcuaro-pottery-upcoming-fowler-lecture/|accessdate=3 July 2014|work=Daily Bruin|date=January 9, 2014|location=Los Angeles, CA}}&lt;/ref&gt; Later in 2013, the Fowler Museum received several gift in honor of its fiftieth anniversity. One gift estimated to be worth around $14 million, from collector and Silicon Valley pioneer [[Jay Last]] and his wife, Deborah. As reported by the [[Los Angeles Times]], the gift consisted of 92 wood and ivory objects from the Lega people of the Democratic Republic of Congo.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Ng|first1=David|title=Fowler Museum at UCLA receives art gift estimated at $14 million|url=http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/arts/culture/la-et-cm-fowler-museum-ucla-20131022-story.html|website=Los Angeles Times|accessdate=3 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Most of the holdings has been collected in the field and systematically documented, providing essential contextual information. Maintaining geographical scope and artistic variety and building on existing strengths continue to be guiding principles in acquisitions decisions. For example, as the Museum augments its programming to meet the interests of the city's growing Latin American population, collection activities in this area have increased. An exceptional collection of more than 900 Mexican works was donated in 1997 by the Daniel Family and includes magnificent ceramic Trees of Life, [[Day of the Dead]] figurines, and masks from Metepec, Oaxaca, Michoacan, Jalisco, Puebla, and Guanajuato.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last2=Mulryan |first2=Lenore Hoag |last=Cosentino |first1=Delia A. |date=2003 |title=Ceramic Trees of Life:Popular Art from Mexico |location=Los Angeles |publisher=UCLA Fowler Museum of Cultural History |page=8 |isbn=9780930741969}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Public programs==
Offered throughout the year, the Fowler's public programs are designed to reflect and complement its dynamic exhibition program, as well as highlight the Museum's world-renowned collection of art from Africa, Asia and the Pacific, and the Americas. Public programs at the Fowler Museum are typically free and open to the public, unless otherwise noted.

===Conversations and lectures===
Current and ongoing exhibitions provide the starting point for programming that touches upon scholarly as well as general interest topics.

===Concert and performances===
The Fowler offers educational and entertaining events throughout the year showcasing world music and performances by local and international artists. '''Fowler Out Loud''' is the museum's performance series that takes place on Thursday nights throughout the academic school year and features international music, dance, poetry, theater, and performance art by UCLA students.

===Events and tours===
From artist walkthroughs to monthly '''Culture Fix''' gallery chats, the Fowler offers numerous opportunities to engage with its exhibitions. In-depth study programs and the museum's signature Fowler on the Town series feature site visits to places of interest in Los Angeles and surrounding areas.

===Film screenings and workshops===
The Fowler presents film screenings throughout the year. The Fowler offers documentaries and features that relate to current exhibitions.Cooking programs, hands-on demonstrations, and dance and yoga are offered on occasion.

==Leadership==
Marla C. Berns has served as the director of the Fowler Museum at UCLA since 2001.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Hood |first=Amy |url= http://newsroom.ucla.edu/releases/Marla-C-Berns-Named-New-Director-2759 |date=October 10, 2001|newspaper=UCLA Newsroom|title=Marla C. Berns Named New Director of the UCLA Fowler Museum of Cultural History}}&lt;/ref&gt; Previously Doran H. Ross, who succeeded Christopher B. Donnan (1981-1996), served as the museum director from 1996 to 2001.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Choi|first1=Linda|title=Fowler Museum exhibit wrapped in African pride|url=http://dailybruin.com/1999/02/11/fowler-museum-exhibit-wrapped/|accessdate=3 July 2014|work=Daily Bruin|agency=UCLA|date=February 11, 1999}}&lt;/ref&gt; One of the most significant initiatives that Berns has launched as director came to fruition in 2006 with the opening of ''Intersections: World Arts, Local Lives'', the Museum's first long-term exhibition of highlights from its renowned permanent collection. The exhibition features a unique thematic and cross-cultural approach and incorporates a wide range of technologies, and has become a staple for K-12 and college-level multicultural education in the Los Angeles area, as well as a favorite stop for general museum visitors interested in world arts.

In addition to continuing the Fowler's pioneering work in the presentation of global arts and cultures, Berns has encouraged the presentation of the work of contemporary artists in exhibitions that speak to both the ongoing dynamism of world cultures and to the resonances between contemporary art and traditional practices. To that end, the Fowler has presented several much-praised solo exhibitions, including the work of the celebrated Ghanaian artist [[El Anatsui]] (2007), Cuban-born artist [[José Bedia Valdés|José Bedia]] (2011), San Francisco-based performance and photo-conceptual artist [[Allan deSouza]] (2011), and the riotous ''[[Nick Cave (performance artist)|Soundsuits of Nick Cave]]'' (2010), one of the Fowler's most popular exhibitions to date.

In 2007, her position was endowed by a $1 million donation from Los Angeles philanthropists Shirley and Ralph Shapiro in recognition of her outstanding contributions to UCLA and the community.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Luther |first=Claudia |url=http://magazine.ucla.edu/features/backing-brilliance/index1.html |journal=UCLA Magazine|date= Jun 1, 2014|title=Bringing World Cultures to Campus}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Abarbanel |first=Stacey |url=http://newsroom.ucla.edu/releases/UCLA-s-Fowler-Museum-Receives-7823 |newspaper=UCLA Newsroom |date=March 28, 2007|title=UCLA's Fowler Museum Receives $1 Million Endowment for Director's Position}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2013, Berns received the medal of [[Ordre des Arts et des Lettres|Chevalier of the Order of Arts and Letters]] of the French Republic in a ceremony conducted by Stéphane Martin, president of the [[Quai Branly Museum]]. The ceremony took place at the Quai Branly Museum in Paris on Tues., Nov 12, at the opening of ''[http://www.quaibranly.fr/en/programmation/exhibitions/last-exhibitions/secrets-of-ivory.html Secrets d'ivoire: L'art des Lega d'Afrique centrale]'', an exhibition of the Fowler Museum's unparalleled collection of African artwork by the [[Lega people]]s of the Democratic Republic of the Congo, which was donated to the Fowler by collectors Jay T. and Deborah R.

[[Baron]] '''Franz Nopcsa von Felső-Szilvás''' (also '''Baron Nopcsa von Felső-Szilvás''', '''Baron Nopcsa''', '''Ferenc Nopcsa''', '''báró felsőszilvási Nopcsa Ferenc''', '''Baron Franz Nopcsa''', and '''Franz Baron Nopcsa''') (May 3, 1877 – April 25, 1933) was a [[Hungary|Hungarian-born]] [[Aristocracy (class)|aristocrat]], adventurer, scholar, and [[Paleontology|paleontologist]]. He is widely regarded as one of the founders of [[paleobiology]] and [[Albanology|Albanian studies]].&lt;ref name=elsie&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.albanianphotography.net/nopcsa/ |title=Baron Franz Nopcsa and his contribution to Albanian studies |work=Albanian Photography |author=[[Robert Elsie]] |date= |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140613005527/http://www.albanianphotography.net/nopcsa/ |archivedate=2014-06-13 |dead-url=yes}} {{webarchive|format=addlarchives|url1=https://archive.is/zKyrW |date1=11 May 2018 |url2=https://www.webcitation.org/query?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.albanianphotography.net%2Fen%2Fnopcsa.html&amp;date=2011-02-25 |date2=25 February 2011}} The essay, first published on Elsie's website, is the basis for the "Introduction" to Nopcsa's memoirs titled ''Traveler, Scholar, Political Adventurer'' (2014) edited by Robert Elsie.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Life ==
Nopcsa was born in 1877 in [[Transylvania]], which at that time was part of [[Austria-Hungary]], to the [[Nopcsa]] [[Aristocracy (class)|aristocratic]] family of [[Magyarization|magyarised]] [[Romanians|Romanian]] origin. In 1895 Nopcsa's younger sister Ilona discovered [[dinosaur]] bones at the family estate at [[Sânpetru, Sântămăria-Orlea|Szentpéterfalva]] in [[Sântămăria-Orlea|Săcel]] (Szacsal), Transylvania. This led to Nopcsa's enrollment at the [[University of Vienna]] to study the [[fossil]]ized bones. He advanced quickly in his studies; he gave his first academic lecture at the age of twenty-two.

In addition to [[Mesozoic]] [[reptile]]s, Nopcsa's interests included [[nationalism|nationhood]] for [[Albania]], then a mere province of the Turkish-Balkan [[Ottoman Empire]], but aspiring to independence. He was one of the few outsiders who ventured into the mountainous areas in the north of Albania. He soon learned the [[Albanian language|Albanian]] dialects and customs.

Eventually, he had good relations with the leaders of the [[nationalist]] Albanian resistance against the [[Ottoman Empire|Turk]]s who occupied the region. Nopcsa gave passionate speeches and smuggled in weapons. In 1912 the [[Balkans|Balkan states]] joined forces to drive out the [[Ottoman Empire|Turk]]s. This was successful, but the newly liberated states were immediately plunged into internal conflicts. However, out of these conflicts, [[Albania]] arose as an independent state. At an international conference aiming to clarify the status of Albania, Nopcsa was at first a contender for the throne of that country.
[[File:Nopcsa Ferenc in shqiptar warrior costume, cca 1913.tif|thumb|Nopcsa Ferenc in shqiptar warrior costume, cca 1913]]
Later, during the [[First World War]], Nopcsa was a [[spy]] for [[Austria-Hungary]]. He also led a group of [[Albanian people|Albanian]] wartime volunteers. However, with the defeat of Austria-Hungary at the end of the war, Nopcsa's native [[Transylvania]] was ceded to [[Romania]]. As a consequence, the [[Baron]] of [[Felső-Szilvás]] lost his estates and other possessions. Compelled to find paid employment, he landed a job as the head of the [[Hungarian Geological Institute]].

But Nopcsa's tenure in the Geological Institute was short-lived. He moved to [[Vienna]] with his long-standing Albanian secretary and lover [[Bajazid Elmaz Doda]] to study [[fossil]]s. Yet there he ran into financial difficulties and was distracted in his work. To cover his debts, he sold his fossil collection to the [[Natural History Museum, London|Natural History Museum]] in [[London]]. Soon Nopcsa became depressed. Finally, in 1933, he fatally shot first his partner, Doda, and then himself. He was cremated at ''Feuerhalle Simmering'' in Vienna, and his ashes buried there (Section 3, Ring 3, Group 8, No. 44).

Nopcsa left behind a considerable quantity of scientific publications and private diaries. The diaries paint a picture of a complex man with great intuition, but without the ability to understand the motives of others. His devotion to the cause of the [[Albanians]] was in contrast to his sociopathic insensitivity. In his diaries he nonchalantly wrote about his bid to become [[Monarch|king]] of [[Albania]]:

{{cquote|''Once a reigning European monarch, I would have no difficulty coming up with the further funds needed by marrying a wealthy American heiress aspiring to royalty, a step which under other circumstances I would have been loath to take.''}}

His previously unpublished memoir was published in German in 2001 and translated to English in 2014 as ''Traveler, Scholar, Political Adventurer: A Transylvanian Baron at the Birth of Albanian Independence'', edited by [[Robert Elsie]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Traveler, Scholar, Political Adventurer: A Transylvanian Baron at the Birth of Albanian Independence (The Memoirs of Franz Nopcsa) |publisher=Central European University Press |author= Franz Nopcsa |editor=[[Robert Elsie]] |year=2014 |isbn=978-6155225802 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Nopcsa, Baron Franz. 2014.

== Contributions to paleobiology and geology ==
[[File:Polacanthus skeleton.jpg|thumb|left|Historical ''[[Polacanthus foxii]]'' skeletal restoration by Franz Nopcsa]] 
Nopcsa's main contribution to [[paleontology]] – and hence "[[paleobiology]]" – was that he was one of the first researchers who tried to "put flesh onto bones." At a time when paleontologists were mainly interested in assembling bones, he tried to deduce the [[physiology]] and [[paleoecology|living behavior]] of the [[dinosaur]]s he was studying. Nopcsa was the first to suggest that these [[archosaur]]s cared for their young and exhibited complex social behavior.

Another of Nopcsa's theories that was ahead of its time was that [[bird]]s evolved from ground-dwelling [[dinosaur]]s, which developed feathers to run faster. This theory found favor in the 1960s and later gained wide acceptance, though later fossil finds of tree-living feathered dinosaurs suggest the development of flight may have been more complex than Nopcsa envisioned. Additionally, Nopcsa's conclusion that at least some [[Mesozoic]] era [[reptile]]s were [[warm-blooded]] is now shared by much of the scientific community.
[[File:Nopcsaspondylus_holotype.jpg|thumb|Vertebra of ''[[Nopcsaspondylus]]'', a [[sauropod]] dinosaur named after the baron in 2007. Other extinct animals named after him include ''[[Elopteryx nopcsai]]'', ''[[Tethysaurus nopcsai]]'', ''[[Hyposaurus nopcsai]]'', and ''[[Mesophis nopcsai]]'']]

Nopcsa studied [[Transylvanian]] [[dinosaur]]s intensively, even though they were smaller than their "cousins" elsewhere in the world. For example, he unearthed six-meter-long [[sauropod]]s, a group of [[dinosaur]]s which elsewhere commonly grew to 30 meters or more, which he named ''[[Magyarosaurus]]''. Nopcsa deduced that the area where the remains were found was an island, [[Hațeg Island]] (now the [[Haţeg]] or Hatzeg basin in [[Romania]]) during the [[Mesozoic]] era. He theorized that "limited resources" found on islands commonly have an effect of "reducing the size of [[animal]]s" over the generations, producing a localized form of [[dwarfism]]. Nopcsa's theory of [[insular dwarfism]]—also known as the [[island rule]]—is today widely accepted (highlighted by Gareth Dyke in "The Dinosaur Baron of Transylvania" In ''Scientific American'', October 2011, pp.&amp;nbsp;81–83). Additional [[pygmy]] sauropods, named ''[[Europasaurus]]'', were recently discovered in northern Germany (analyzed by P. Martin Sander in ''Nature'', 8 June 2006).

Nopcsa also created a theory about the dinosaurs' [[sexual dimorphism]]. Among others, he thought that [[hadrosaurid]] [[species]] with the cranial crests were males and those without them were females. He paired ''[[Kritosaurus]]'' with ''[[Parasaurolophus]]'', ''[[Prosaurolophus]]'' with ''[[Saurolophus]]'' and others. His examples were not proved to be true, but his opinion that sexual dimorphism was present among hadrosaurid dinosaurs has gained acceptance, see for example ''[[Lambeosaurus]]''.

As a result of the above studies and publications, Nopcsa is sometimes considered to be the "father" of modern [[paleobiology]], even though he originally termed the field as "[[paleophysiology]]."

But he was also an important [[geologist]]. Indeed, Nopcsa was one of the first scholars to study the [[geology]] of the western [[Balkans]], particularly northern [[Albania]].

== Contribution to Albanian studies ==
[[File:Baron Franz Nopcsa in Albanian uniform.jpg|thumb|left]]
During his lifetime Nopcsa published more than fifty scientific studies concerning [[Albania]], covering a wide range of [[natural language|linguistic]]s, [[folklore]], [[ethnology]], history and ''[[Kanun (Albania)|kanun]]'' (that is, [[Albania]]n customary law). He was the leading expert on [[Albania]] in his time.

After Nopcsa's death, several of his important manuscripts were left unpublished. He participated in the work of the [[Albanian Congress of Trieste]], published his notes on the congress that became of particular [[History|historical]] interest.&lt;ref name=elsie/&gt; The [[Albanology|Albanological]] part of his estate ended up in the hands of [[Norbert Jokl]], a renowned specialist in Albanian studies. At that time, Nopcsa's material consisted of thousands of pages of notes, sketches, and finished text. Subsequently, this library came into possession of [[Mid'hat Bey Frashëri]]. When Frashëri was forced to flee the country, Nopcsa's materials were confiscated by the [[Communism in Albania|communist regime]] of [[Enver Hoxha]]. Eventually, Nopcsa's manuscripts, drawings, and completed writings formed the core of the Albanological section of [[National Library of Albania|Albania's National Library]].

The '''Gardiner Museum''' is Canada's national ceramics museum. It was founded by [[George R. Gardiner|George]] and Helen Gardiner in 1984 to house their collection of ceramic art. It is located on Queen's Park just south of Bloor Street in [[Toronto]], [[Ontario]], Canada, opposite the [[Royal Ontario Museum]]. The nearest subway station is [[Museum (TTC)|Museum]].

==History==
The Gardiner Museum was founded in 1984 by [[George R. Gardiner|George]] and Helen Gardiner. It originally opened as the George R. Gardiner Museum of Ceramic Art to house the couple's collection. From 1976 when they started collecting ceramics to 1981 when they decided to share their treasures with the public, George and Helen assembled several astounding specialized collections in the fields of pottery from the Ancient Americas and European ceramics that would become the core of the museum when it opened. In their depth and breadth, the Gardiner's collections of Meissen porcelain, rare [[Vienna porcelain|Du Paquier porcelain]] from Vienna (the second factory to successfully produce hard-paste porcelain in Europe), and Hausmaler decorated porcelain are of world importance. The Gardiners also established one of the best collections of Italian Renaissance maiolica in Canada, and the most comprehensive collection of figures from the commedia dell'arte in a public institution.
[[File:Gardiner Museum Illusions 2012.JPG|left|thumb|Exterior view of the Gardiner Museum in 2012. The museum reopened in 2006, after two years of renovations.]]
Between 1987 and 1996, the Gardiner Museum was managed by the Royal Ontario Museum, located across the street on Queen's Park Crescent. In 1996, an endowment from George Gardiner supported the museum becoming an independent institution again. In January 2004, the Gardiner Museum closed temporarily to implement a major expansion, with funding provided primarily by the Government of Canada, the Province of Ontario, and Helen Gardiner. Building on the qualities of the original structure, designed by architect Keith Wagland, the architectural firm of [[KPMB Architects|Kuwabara Payne McKenna Blumberg]] added exhibition galleries, larger educational, administration and studio spaces, a new retail shop, as well as a new dining and special events area. During this period, the museum temporarily relocated to a warehouse at 60 McCaul Street. The original building was designed by [[Keith Wagland]], who was professor to Kuwabara during his time at the [[University of Toronto]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.thecanadianencyclopedia.ca/en/exhibit/gardiner-museum-of-ceramic-art/&lt;/ref&gt; When the Gardiner Museum re-opened in 2006, the renovation received widespread critical acclaim and is often cited as one of the most beautiful buildings in Toronto. The addition of over 14,000 square feet has allowed the museum to broaden its focus to include  an expanded collections purview, more special exhibitions, and opportunities for greater public participation.

As the museum grew, ceramic collectors were attracted to what had become one of the most significant centres of ceramics in North America. For example, The Radlett Collection of 18th-century English porcelain is now an important component of the museum, and the 1760 Beer Jug with a portrait of [[General James Wolfe]] is one of the best known pieces in this collection. The Robert Murray Bell and Ann Walker Bell Collection of Chinese Blue and White Porcelain is another highlight, including a Qing dynasty Bianhu (flask). The Macdonald Collection of Japanese and Japanese-inspired porcelain, including the Kakiemon cup and saucer with the "Lady in a Pavilion", forms a very special aspect of the museum, illuminating the connection between the cultures of Japan and Europe in the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries.

The Hans Syz Collection, donated in 1996, is a remarkable assemblage of European porcelain. The Norman and Cecily Bell Collection, donated in 1998, consists predominantly of English transfer-printed wares of unique quality. The Thomas Henry Clark Collection, donated in 1999, comprises important pieces of English and Continental tin-glazed earthenware. In 1991, Helen Armstrong bequeathed the Vernon W. Armstrong Collection of eighteenth-century porcelain. Some of the Gardiner's finest Minton pieces have been donated by Robert and Marian Cumming since 1991. In 2008, Jean and Kenneth Laundy donated a significant collection of eighteenthand nineteenth-century creamware, and in 2012 and 2013 the Gardiner received outstanding examples of seventeenth- and eighteenth-century French faience from Pierre and Mariel O'Neill-Karch. Numerous other donors have given exceptional ceramic art to the museum including Aaron Milrad and Diana Reitberger. A recent transformative donation was The Raphael Yu Collection of Canadian Ceramics, made in 2011, which added 318 objects. The museum is committed to building the finest collection of Canadian ceramics in the country, as well as ensuring that vital curatorial work about these ceramics is undertaken.

Today the museum boasts an expanding permanent collection, a full schedule of exhibitions and programs (including popular clay classes for adults and children), and a growing audience.

==Collection==
[[File:Whistles - Gardiner Museum, Toronto - DSC01177.JPG|thumb|Exhibits of the museum's permanent collection are displayed throughout the museum.]]
Its permanent collection of over 4,000 pieces, includes works from the [[Ceramics of indigenous peoples of the Americas|Ancient Americas]], [[Italian Renaissance]], [[English Delftware]], [[Chinese ceramics|Chinese]] and [[Japanese pottery and porcelain|Japanese porcelain]], [[Porcelain#European porcelain|European porcelain]], and a contemporary gallery. In addition to the permanent collections, the museum mounts temporary special exhibitions throughout the year.

==Programs==
The museum offers programs, lectures, and other special events. It has several studio spaces in which clay classes for adults and children are offered.

==Affiliations==
The museum is affiliated with the [[Canadian Museums Association]], [[Canadian Heritage Information Network]] and the [[Virtual Museum of Canada]].

The '''Intervasion of the UK''' was a 1994 [[Electronic Civil Disobedience|electronic civil disobedience]] and collective action against [[John Major]]'s [[Criminal Justice and Public Order Act 1994|Criminal Justice Bill]] which sought to outlaw outdoor dance festivals and "music with a repetitive beat". Launched by a group called The [[Zippies]] from [[San Francisco]]'s [[181 Club]] on [[Guy Fawkes Day]], November 5, 1994, it resulted in government websites going down for at least a week.&lt;ref&gt;[http://medialternatives.blogetery.com/2010/12/15/intervasion-supports-anonymous Wikileaks Infowar not the first online protest action | Medialternatives&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110821141633/http://medialternatives.blogetery.com/2010/12/15/intervasion-supports-anonymous/ |date=2011-08-21 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It utilised a form of Distributed Denial of Service ([[DDoS]]) known as the [[E-mail bomb|Email bomb]] in order to overload servers as a form of [[online protest]] and [[Internet activism]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://medialternatives.blogetery.com/2011/02/07/2828/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-02-19 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110215024709/http://medialternatives.blogetery.com/2011/02/07/2828/ |archivedate=2011-02-15 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; It was the first such use of the [[Internet]] and technology as a weapon of struggle and/or civil disobedience, and preceded the [[:it:Netstrike|1995 Italian NetStrike]].

Under the [[Criminal Justice and Public Order Act 1994|Criminal Justice and Public Order Act of 1994]], the definition of music played at a rave was given as: "music includes sounds wholly or predominantly characterised by the emission of a succession of repetitive beats".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.opsi.gov.uk/acts/acts1994/ukpga_19940033_en_8#pt5-pb2 |title=Public Order: Collective Trespass or Nuisance on Land - Powers to remove trespassers on land - Powers to remove persons attending or preparing for a rave |work=Criminal Justice and Public Order Act 1994 |publisher=[[Her Majesty's Stationery Office]] |accessdate=2008-06-09| year=1994}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sections 63, 64 &amp; 65 of the Act targeted electronic dance music played at [[rave]]s. The Criminal Justice and Public Order Act empowered police to stop a rave in the open air when "ten or more people are attending, or where two or more are making preparations for a rave". Section 65 allowed any uniformed constable who believes a person is on their way to a rave within a {{convert|5|mi|km|adj=on}} radius to stop them and direct them away from the area; "non-compliant citizens may be subject to a maximum fine not exceeding level 3 on the standard scale (£1000)".{{citequote|date=May 2018}}

The Zippies sought to jam the mailboxes of UK politicians associated with the Bill in order to bring their attention to the issue of [[natural justice]] involving basic rights and freedoms. In effect, the collective action was saying: "If you take away our freedom, we have the power to take away something you take for granted, and to do this in a way which deploys the Internet as a weapon".{{citequote|date=May 2018}}

Several hackers not directly associated with the group launched all-out [[penetration testing]] and load testing operations against several UK government websites, resulting in a tit-for-tat battle, as the Zippies mailbox on morph.com went down, along with the entire server of Morph, a well-known Bay Area [[Bulletin board system|BBS]].

==Media Coverage==
The event was broadcast on Radio Free Berkeley.

The protest action occurred during the manhunt for [[Kevin Mitnick]] and was thus partly an underground event. The media also refused to entertain the implications of electronic civil disobedience, with public attention focused on the problem of illegal raves and black-hat hackers, prompting scare stories about "evil hackers" and "young hoodlums" penetrating the British defences while the zippies were written off as nothing more than electrohippies.

==Criticism==
Some criticism of the Intervasion was expressed by the [[Electronic Frontier Foundation]] who complained about the "lack of a cutoff date"{{citequote|date=May 2018}}. Other criticism on the [[Whole Earth 'Lectronic Link]] (WELL) BBS centered on the use of militant language. The online protest action also suffered from conflict between its stated aims: "To clog the servers of the UK government", and its call to send email messages to UK politicians. Thus jamming mailboxes with email and large file attachments defeated the purpose of the exercise which was essentially an early form of hacktivism. The nature of the collective action was also not articulated well enough. For instance, the digital be-in which occurred during the launch of [[Timothy Leary]]'s Chaos and Cyberculture, in which Leary was "kidnapped" without the consent of his publisher, and "forced" to DDoS the UK government, was simply a protest message, sent repeatedly to mail-boxes around the world.

'''Ironbridge Gorge Museum Trust''' is an [[industrial heritage]] organisation which runs ten [[museum]]s and manages 35 historic sites within the [[Ironbridge Gorge]] in [[Shropshire]], England, widely considered as the birthplace of the [[Industrial Revolution]].

The Gorge includes a number of settlements important to industrial history and with heritage assets, including [[Ironbridge]], [[Coalport]] and [[Jackfield]] along the [[River Severn]], and also [[Coalbrookdale]] and [[Broseley]]. The area is a [[World Heritage Site]] (since 1986) and an anchor point of the [[European Route of Industrial Heritage]] (ERIH).

==Museums==
The ten museum sites run by the Trust, collectively known as the '''Ironbridge Gorge Museums''' are:

# [[Blists Hill Victorian Town]], including the [[Hay Inclined Plane]]
# [[Broseley Pipeworks]]
# [[Coalbrookdale Museum of Iron]]
# [[Coalport China Museum]]
# [[Coalport Tar Tunnel]]
# [[Darby Houses]]
# [[Enginuity]]
# [[The Iron Bridge|Iron Bridge and Tollhouse]]
# [[Jackfield Tile Museum]]
# [[Museum of the Gorge, Ironbridge|Museum of the Gorge]]

==The Trust==
Ironbridge Gorge Museum Trust was established in 1968&lt;ref name="Trinder, 242" &gt;{{Cite book
  |title=The Industrial Revolution in Shropshire
  |last=Trinder  |first=Barrie
  |origyear=1973

  |publisher=Phillimore
  |ref={{harvid|Trinder|1981}}
  |page=242
}}&lt;/ref&gt; to preserve and interpret the birthplace of the Industrial Revolution in the Ironbridge Gorge. It is an independent educational [[Charitable organization|charity]].&lt;ref&gt;{{EW charity|503717|Ironbridge Gorge Museum Trust Limited}}&lt;/ref&gt; From 1970 it absorbed the Coalbrookdale Museum, now the Coalbrookdale Museum of Iron, which had been established in 1959.&lt;ref name="Trinder, 242" /&gt;

Its present CEO is Anna Brennand, who took over from Steve Miller in 2013. Previous CEOs have included [[Stuart Smith (archaeologist)|Stuart Smith]] and [[Sir Neil Cossons]], both well-respected experts on industrial history and archaeology.

The museum staff manage 35 historic sites within the Ironbridge Gorge World Heritage Site, including ten museums. The sites also include archaeological sites, two chapels, housing, two [[Quaker]] burial grounds, a research library, a tourist information centre, woodland, and two [[youth hostel]]s.

For over 20 years the museum has had a wide-ranging and innovative archaeology unit&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.ironbridge.org.uk/our-story/sector-support/archaeology/ Ironbridge Archaeology]&lt;/ref&gt; which originally undertook archaeological work within the Ironbridge Gorge and throughout the country, although it now concentrates its work within the Ironbridge Gorge. 



==Ironbridge Institute==
The Trust also runs the [[Ironbridge Institute]] in Coalbrookdale, a centre offering postgraduate and professional courses in heritage, in partnership with the [[University of Birmingham]].

'''{{lang|de|Kurrent}}''' is an old form of [[German language|German-language]] handwriting based on late medieval cursive writing, also known as {{lang|de|Kurrentschrift}}, {{lang|de|deutsche Schrift}} ("German script") and ''German cursive''. Over the history of its use into the first part of the 20th century, many individual letters acquired variant forms.

German writers used both cursive styles, {{lang|de|Kurrent}} and [[English cursive]], in parallel: location, contents, and context of the text determined which script style to use.

{{lang|de|[[Sütterlin]]}} is a modern script based on {{lang|de|Kurrent}} that is characterized by simplified letters and vertical strokes. It was developed in 1911 and taught in all German schools as the primary script from 1935 until the beginning of January 1941. Then it was replaced with {{lang|de|deutsche Normalschrift}} ("normal German handwriting"), which is sometimes referred to as "Latin writing".

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3058">'''Lady of Guardamar''' (''Dama de Guardamar''), is a limestone female bust, 50 cm high, dated circa 400 BCE, that was discovered in fragments in the [[Phoenicia]]n archaeological site of Cabezo Lucero in [[Guardamar del Segura]] in [[Alicante]] province, [[Spain]], on September 22, 1987.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.convega.com/historia/guardamar/historia.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2013-06-13 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090413125723/http://www.convega.com/historia/guardamar/historia.html |archivedate=2009-04-13 |df= }} Historia Guardamar&lt;/ref&gt;
[[Image:Cabezolucerodama.jpg|thumb|250px|]]

A large piece of a stone rodete (wheel headgear) was found first, at a shallow depth. There followed other fragments of the bust of an [[Iberians|Iberian]] lady, and one large piece included the headdress, face and neck, which were found to have similarities to the [[Iberians|Iberian]] bust, [[Lady of Elche]]. The sculpture had been hammered to fragments and even burnt in places. These fragments were taken to the laboratory of the Provincial Archaeological Museum of Alicante, where restorer Vincent Bernabeu began with washing and identifying the bits, first the chin, then the lips, then collar and chest pieces, and many other fragments that did not fit together and were not part of the carved surface. The delicate and painstaking task of restoration began in October 1987 and was completed in June 1988.

The restored sculpture is of fine-grained greyish limestone. The Lady is wearing a tunic with a round neckline.
A scalloped headband crosses the brow and connects the rodetes, which represent hollow wheels, probably of thin metal, on each side. Above the headband and rodetes the Lady wears a mantle with finely carved drapery details. The necklaces the Lady wears are each different; one is composed of seven bullae which are all the same except for the central one, which is grooved. Below it is another necklace that has larger bullae, some shaped like curved triangles and some semicircular at the bottom. The string of beads worn second from the neck has olive-shaped, spherical and flat beads, above it is a string of spherical beads with two plates at the center. In real life these beads would have been made of glassy paste, as such beads often appeared in the Albufereta excavation.

In style the Lady of Guardamar is a bit more archaic than the other contemporary Iberian sculptures [[Lady of Baza]] or the [[Lady of Elche]], with features more [[Iberians|Iberian]]. As nothing from the site is more recent than 300 BCE, and the site flourished between 430 and 350 BCE, it seems likely that the Lady dates from 400 to 370 BCE.

'''Lake Tuz''' ({{lang-tr|'''Tuz Gölü'''}} meaning Salt Lake) is the second largest [[lake]] in [[Turkey]] with its {{convert|1665|km2|mi2|abbr=on}}
surface area and one of the largest [[hypersaline lake]]s in the world. It is located in the [[Central Anatolia Region]], {{convert|105|km|mi|abbr=on}} northeast of [[Konya]], {{convert|150|km|mi|abbr=on}} south-southeast of [[Ankara]] and {{convert|57|km|mi|abbr=on}} northwest of [[Aksaray]].

==Geography==
[[Image:Turkey.LakeTuz004.jpg|thumb|left|220px|Salty shores of Lake Tuz.]]The lake, occupying a tectonic depression in the central plateau of Turkey, is fed by two major streams, groundwater, and surface water, but has no outlet. [[Brackish marsh]]es have formed where channels and streams enter the lake.  Arable fields surround the lake, except in the south and southwest where extensive seasonally flooded salt-steppe occurs.

For most of the year, it is very shallow (approx.{{convert|0.4|m|ft|0|abbr=on}}). During winter part of the salt is dissolved in the fresh water that is introduced to the lake by precipitation and [[surface runoff]] (to 324% [[salinity]]). During the summer the lake dries up exposing an average of 30&amp;nbsp;cm thick salt layer in August. This mechanism is used as a basis for the process of the salt mines in the lake. The three mines operating in the lake produce 63% of the salt consumed in Turkey. The salt mining generates industrial activity in the region, mainly related to salt processing and refining.

In 2001, Lake Tuz was declared a specially protected area, including all of the lake surface and surrounding waterbeds and some of the important neighboring steppe areas. The main Turkish breeding colony of [[greater flamingo]] (''Phoenicopterus roseus'') is present on a group of islands in the southern part of the lake. [[Greater white-fronted goose]] (''Anser albifrons'') is the second largest breeder here. [[Lesser kestrel]] (''Falco naumanni'') is a common breeder in surrounding villages.

The [[UNESCO|United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization]] (UNESCO) [[World Heritage site]]s are places of importance to [[cultural heritage|cultural]] or [[natural heritage]] as described in the UNESCO World Heritage Convention, established in 1972.&lt;ref name=convention&gt;{{cite web |url=http://whc.unesco.org/en/convention/ |title=The World Heritage Convention |publisher=UNESCO |accessdate=September 21, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Caribbean Sea|Caribbean]] island-nation of [[Cuba]] accepted the convention on March 24, 1981, making its historical sites eligible for inclusion on the list; as of 2011, nine sites in Cuba are included.&lt;ref name=cuba&gt;{{cite web |url=http://whc.unesco.org/en/statesparties/cu/ |title=Cuba |publisher=UNESCO |accessdate=October 12, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Cuba had its first site included on the list at the 6th Session of World Heritage Committee, held at UNESCO headquarters in [[Paris]], [[France]], in December 1982. At that session, "[[Old Havana|Old Havana and its Fortifications]]", a site including the central, historic portion of the Cuban capital of [[Havana]], as well as Spanish colonial fortifications, was inscribed on the list.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://whc.unesco.org/archive/repcom82.htm |title=Report of the Rapporteur |publisher=UNESCO |date=January 17, 1983 |accessdate=October 12, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Cuba's inclusions on the list include a variety of sites. Two sites are selected for their natural significance: [[Alejandro de Humboldt National Park]] in the eastern provinces of [[Holguín Province|Holguín]] and [[Guantánamo Province|Guantánamo]],&lt;ref name=humboldt/&gt; and [[Desembarco del Granma National Park]], named for the yacht which carried the members of the [[26th of July Movement]] who started the [[Cuban Revolution]].&lt;ref name=granma/&gt; City landscapes include [[Old Havana]],&lt;ref name=havana/&gt; [[Trinidad, Cuba|Trinidad]],&lt;ref name=trinidad/&gt; and [[Camagüey]],&lt;ref name=camaguey/&gt; all founded by early Spanish colonists in the 16th century. The sites also include historical agricultural regions, including the coffee plantations of southeastern Cuba,&lt;ref name=plantations/&gt; and the tobacco region of [[Viñales Valley]].&lt;ref name=valley/&gt;

{{Original research|date=September 2011}}
'''Majoritarianism''' is a traditional [[political philosophy]] or agenda that asserts that a [[majority]] (sometimes categorized by [[religion]], [[language]], [[social class]], or some other identifying factor) of the population is entitled to a certain degree of primacy in society, and has the right to make decisions that affect the society. This traditional view has come under growing criticism and democracies have increasingly included constraints in what the parliamentary majority can do, in order to protect citizens' fundamental rights.&lt;ref&gt;A Przeworski, JM Maravall, I NetLibrary ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=EMB-F6Forx8C Democracy and the Rule of Law]'' (2003) p. 223&lt;/ref&gt;

This should not be confused with the concept of a [[majoritarian]] electoral system, which is a simple electoral system that usually gives a majority of seats to the party with a [[Plurality (voting)|plurality]] of votes. A parliament elected by this method may be called a '''majoritarian''' parliament (e.g., the [[Parliament of the United Kingdom]] and the [[Parliament of India]]).

Under a democratic majoritarian political structure, the majority would not exclude any minority from future participation in the democratic process. Majoritarianism is sometimes [[pejorative]]ly referred to by its opponents as "[[Ochlocracy|ochlocracy]]" or "[[tyranny of the majority]]". Majoritarianism is often referred to as '''majority rule''', which may refer to a majority class ''ruling'' over a minority class, while not referring to the decision process called ''[[majority rule]].

==Concept in depth==
Advocates of majoritarianism argue that [[majority]] decision making is intrinsically democratic and that any restriction on majority decision making is intrinsically undemocratic. If democracy is restricted by a [[constitution]] which cannot be changed by a [[majority|simple majority]] decision then yesterday's majority is being given more weight than today's.  If it is restricted by some small group, such as [[Aristocracy (class)|aristocrat]]s, [[judge]]s, [[priest]]s, [[soldier]]s, or [[philosopher]]s, then society becomes an [[oligarchy]]. The only restriction acceptable in a majoritarian system is that a current majority has no right to prevent a different majority emerging in the future (this could happen, for example, if a minority persuades enough of the majority to change its position). In particular, a majority cannot exclude a minority from future participation in the democratic process. Majoritarianism does not prohibit a decision being made by representatives as long as this decision is made via majority rule, as it can be altered at any time by any different majority emerging in the future.

One critique of majoritarianism is that systems without [[supermajority]] requirements for changing the rules for voting can be shown to likely be unstable.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Choosing How to Choose: Self-Stable Majority Rules and Constitutions|doi=10.1162/0033553041502207|journal=[[Quarterly Journal of Economics]]|volume=119|issue=3|pages=1011–48|year=2004|first1=Barbera|last1=Salvador|first2=Matthew O.|last2=Jackson|url=http://restud.oxfordjournals.org/content/78/1/1.full#ref-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; Among other critiques of majoritarianism is that most decisions in fact take place not by majority rule, but by plurality, unless the [[voting system]] artificially restricts candidates or options to two only.&lt;ref name=liberalism_vs_populism /&gt; In turn, due to [[Arrow's paradox]], it is not possible to have plurality voting systems with more than two options that retain adherence to both certain "fairness" criteria and rational decision-making criteria.&lt;ref name=liberalism_vs_populism&gt;{{cite book|title=Liberalism Against Populism|first=William|last=Riker|authorlink=William H. Riker|isbn=0-88133-367-0|year=1988|origyear=First published in 1982|publisher=Waveland Press|location=Prospect Heights, Illinois}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Types==
Majoritarianism, as a concept of government, branches out into several forms. The classic form includes [[unicameral]]ism and a [[unitary state]].

Qualified majoritarianism is a more inclusionary form, with degrees of decentralization and federalism.

Integrative majoritarianism incorporates several institutions to preserve minority groups and foster moderate political parties.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nd.edu/~kellogg/pdfs/Reynolds.pdf |title=Majoritarian or Power-Sharing Government |date=December 9–11, 1999 |first=Andrew |last=Reynolds |work=www.nd.edu |publisher= |accessdate=September 8, 2013 |archivedate=November 8, 2001 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20011108234605/http://www.nd.edu/~kellogg/pdfs/Reynolds.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History and legacy==
There are relatively few instances of large-scale majority rule in recorded history, most notably the majoritarian system of [[Athenian democracy]] and other [[ancient Greece|ancient Greek]] [[city-state]]s. However, some argue that none of those Greek city-states were truly majority rule, particularly due to their exclusion of women, non-landowners, and slaves from decision-making processes. Most of the famous ancient philosophers staunchly opposed majoritarianism, because decisions based on the will of the uneducated and uninformed 'masses' are not necessarily wise or just. [[Plato]] is a prime example with his ''[[The Republic (Plato)|Republic]]'', which describes a societal model based on a tripartite class structure.

Anarchist anthropologist [[David Graeber]] offers a reason as to why majority democratic government is so scarce in the historical record. "Majority democracy, we might say, can only emerge when two factors coincide: 1. a feeling that people should have equal say in making group decisions, and 2. a coercive apparatus capable of enforcing those decisions." Graeber argues that those two factors almost never meet: "Where egalitarian societies exist, it is also usually considered wrong to impose systematic coercion. Where a machinery of coercion did exist, it did not even occur to those wielding it that they were enforcing any sort of popular will."&lt;ref&gt;Graeber, David. ''[http://www.prickly-paradigm.com/paradigm14.pdf Fragments of an Anarchist Anthropology] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081118113209/http://www.prickly-paradigm.com/paradigm14.pdf |date=2008-11-18 }}'' (2004) p. 89&lt;/ref&gt;

Majoritarianism (as a theory), similar to democracy, has often been used as a pretext by sizable or aggressive minorities to politically oppress other smaller (or civically inactive) minorities, or even sometimes a civically inactive majority (see [[Richard Nixon]]'s reference to the "[[Silent Majority (Politics)|Silent Majority]]" that he asserted supported his policies).

This agenda is most frequently encountered in the realm of religion: In essentially all [[Western world|Western]] nations, for instance, [[Christmas Day]]—and in some countries, other important dates in the [[Christian]] calendar as well—are recognized as legal holidays; plus a particular denomination may be designated as the [[state religion]] and receive financial backing from the government (examples include the [[Church of England]] in [[England]] and the [[Lutheran Church]] in the [[Scandinavia]]n countries). Virtually all countries also have one or more official languages, often to the exclusion of some minority group or groups within that country who do not speak the language or languages so designated. In most cases, those decisions have not been made using a majoritarian [[referendum]], and even in the rare case when a referendum has been used, a new majority is not allowed to emerge at any time and repeal it.

In recent times—especially beginning in the 1960s—some forms of majoritarianism have been countered by [[liberalism|liberal]] reformers in many countries{{clarify|reason=Which countries? Only US example is mentioned and no sources|date=January 2012}}: in the 1963 case ''[[Abington School District v.

This has provoked a backlash from some advocates of majoritarianism, who lament the [[Balkanization]] of society they claim has resulted from the gains made by the multicultural agenda; these concerns were articulated in a 1972 book, ''The Dispossessed Majority'', written by [[Wilmot Robertson]]. Multiculturalists, in turn, have accused majoritarians of [[racism]] and [[xenophobia]].{{citation needed|date=December 2011}}

A '''miscellany''' is a collection of various pieces of writing by different authors. Meaning a mixture, medley, or assortment, a [[wikt:miscellany|miscellany]] can include pieces on many subjects and in a variety of different [[Literary genre|forms]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.oed.com/view/Entry/119276?rskey=nK2Wqw&amp;result=1 Miscellany, n.] ''OED Online''. Oxford University Press. Retrieved April 18, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; In contrast to [[Anthology|anthologies]], whose aim is to give a ''selective'' and ''[[Western canon|canonical]]'' view of literature, miscellanies were produced for the entertainment of a contemporary audience and so instead emphasise ''collectiveness'' and ''popularity''. Laura Mandell and Rita Raley state:
{{quote|This last distinction is quite often visible in the basic categorical differences between anthologies on the one hand, and all other types of collections on the other, for it is in the one that we read poems of excellence, the "best of English poetry," and it is in the other that we read poems of interest. Out of the differences between a principle of selection (the anthology) and a principle of collection (miscellanies and beauties), then, comes a difference in aesthetic value, which is precisely what is at issue in the debates over the "proper" material for inclusion into the canon.&lt;ref&gt;Laura Mandell and Rita Raley, [http://oldsite.english.ucsb.edu/faculty/rraley/research/anthologies/#miscellanies ''Anthologies and Miscellanies''] (1997; last revised 2002).

Manuscript miscellanies are important in the [[Middle Ages]], and are the sources for most surviving shorter medieval vernacular poetry.  Medieval miscellanies often include completely different types of text, mixing poetry with legal documents, recipes, music, medical and devotional literature and other types of text, and in medieval contexts a mixture of types of text is often taken as a necessary condition for describing a manuscript as a miscellany.  They may have been written as a collection, or represent manuscripts of different origins that were later bound together for convenience.  In the [[early modern period]] miscellanies remained significant in a more restricted literary context, both in manuscript and printed forms, mainly as a vehicle for collections of shorter pieces of poetry, but also other works.  Their numbers increased until their peak of importance in the [[18th century in literature|18th century]], when [[#Development in the 18th century|over 1000]] English poetry miscellanies were published,&lt;ref&gt;[http://digitalmiscellaniesindex.org/about/ "About"], Digital Miscellanies Index&lt;/ref&gt; before the [[#Succession of the anthology|rise of anthologies]] in the early 19th century.  The printed miscellany gradually morphed into the format of the regularly published [[magazine]], and many early magazines used the word in their titles.

== Manuscript and printed miscellanies before the 18th century ==
[[File:Ararat Ms. 11639 521a.jpg|thumb|Miniature of [[Noah's Ark]] landing on the [[Mountains of Ararat]] (fol. 521a), from the 13th century [[North French Hebrew Miscellany]]]]

The broadest distinction is between [[manuscript]] and [[printing|printed]] miscellanies. Manuscript miscellanies were carefully compiled by hand, but also circulated, consumed, and sometimes added to in this organic state – they were a prominent feature of 16th and early 17th century literary culture. Printed miscellanies, which evolved in the late 17th and 18th centuries, were compiled by editors and published by booksellers in order to make a profit. While manuscript miscellanies were produced by a small coterie of writers, and so were constructed around their own personal tastes, printed miscellanies were increasingly aimed towards a popular audience, and bear the marks of commercially driven, money making, opportunistic endeavours.&lt;ref&gt;Richard Beadle, Colin Burrow (eds.), ''Manuscript Miscellanies, c. 1450-1700'' (London: British Library, 2011).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Adam Smyth, ''‘‘Profit and Delight’’: Printed Miscellanies in England, 1640–1682'' (Detroit: Wayne State University Press, 2004).&lt;/ref&gt;

Multi-authored collections are known to exist in many forms – such as [[newspapers]], [[magazines]], or [[Literary magazine|journals]] – and the act of [[commonplace book|commonplacing]], of transcribing useful extracts and quotations from multiple sources is also well recorded. However, the formal production of ''literary'' miscellanies came into its established form in the 16th and 17th centuries, and reached a highpoint in the 18th century. Although literary miscellanies would often contain critical essays and extracts of prose or drama, their main focus was popular [[Verse (poetry)|verse]], often including [[songs]]. At this time poetry was still a dominant literary form, for both low and high literature, and its variety and accessibility further suited it to miscellaneous publication.&lt;ref&gt;J. Paul Hunter, ‘Political, satirical, didactic and lyric poetry: from the Restoration to the death of Pope’ in John Richetti (ed.) ''The Cambridge History of English Literature, 1660-1780'' (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 2005), 160-208, pp. 160-163.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Medieval miscellanies===
[[File:Trevelyon leaf.jpg|thumb|right|A patterned page from the Trevelyon Miscellany of 1608]]
Most medieval miscellanies include some religious texts, and many consist of nothing else. A few examples are given here to illustrate the range of material typically found. The [[Theological miscellany (British Library, MS Additional 43460)]] was made in late 8th century Italy with 202 folios of [[patristic]] writings in Latin. The 9th-century Irish [[Book of Armagh]] is also mostly in Latin but includes some of the earliest surviving [[Old Irish]] writing, as well as several texts on [[Saint Patrick]], significant sections of the [[New Testament]], and a 4th-century saint's [[Sulpicius Severus#Life of St. Martin, dialogues, and letters|''Life'']]. The [[Nowell Codex]] (BL Cotton Vitellius A. xv, ignoring a later volume bound in with it) is an [[Old English]] manuscript of about 1000 to 1010. It is famous for the only text of ''[[Beowulf]]'' but also includes a life of [[Saint Christopher]], ''[[Wonders of the East]]'' (a description of various far-off lands and their fantastic inhabitants), a translation of a ''Letter of Alexander to Aristotle'', and the poem ''[[Judith (poem)|Judith]]'' based on the [[Old Testament]] ''[[Book of Judith]]''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bl.uk/manuscripts/FullDisplay.aspx?ref=Cotton_MS_vitellius_a_xv British Library] page on the Nowell Codex.&lt;/ref&gt;  It is one of [[Anglo-Saxon literature#Extant manuscripts|the four Old English Poetic Codices]] from which the bulk of surviving [[Old English poetry]] comes, all of which can be classed as miscellanies.

The ''[[Lacnunga]]'' is a 10th or 11th century miscellany in Old English, Latin and Old Irish, with health-related texts taking a wide range of approaches, from [[herbal medicine]] and other medical procedures, to prayers and charms.  The lavishly illuminated late 13th century [[North French Hebrew Miscellany]] contains mostly biblical and liturgical texts, but also legal material, over 200 poems, and calendars.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bl.uk/catalogues/illuminatedmanuscripts/record.asp?MSID=19212&amp;CollID=27&amp;NStart=11639 British Library catalogue online], North French Miscellany&lt;/ref&gt;  The large 9th-century Chinese text ''[[Miscellaneous Morsels from Youyang]]'', contains various Chinese and foreign legends and hearsay, reports on natural phenomena, short anecdotes, and tales of the wondrous and mundane, as well as notes on such topics as medicinal herbs and tattoos. The ''[[Trevelyon Miscellany of 1608]]'', an oversized illustrated manuscript of 594 pages, depicts a wide range of subjects including herbal cures, biblical stories, a list of the mayors of London, proverbs, calendars, and embroidery patterns.&lt;ref&gt;Exhibited at the [[Folger Shakespeare Library]], in [http://folgerpedia.folger.edu/Word_%26_Image:_The_Trevelyon_Miscellany_of_1608/ 2004]&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Verse miscellanies ===

Verse miscellanies are collections of poems or poetic extracts that vary in authorship, genre, and subject matter. The earlier tradition of manuscript verse continued to be produced in the 16th century and onwards, and many of these early examples are preserved in national, state, and university libraries, as well as in private collections. The [[Devonshire MS|Devonshire Manuscript]] is a verse miscellany that was produced in the 1530s and early 1540s, and contains a range of works, from original pieces and fragments to translations and medieval verse. Compiled by three eminent women, it is one of the first examples of men and women collaborating on a literary work.&lt;ref&gt;Southall, Raymond. “The Devonshire Manuscript Collection of Early Tudor Poetry, 1532–41,” ''Review of English Studies'', n.s. 15 (1964): 142-50.&lt;/ref&gt;

Also prominent is the Arundel Harington manuscript, containing the writings of [[Thomas Wyatt (poet)|Sir Thomas Wyatt]], [[Elizabeth I of England|Queen Elizabeth]], and [[Philip Sidney|Sir Philip Sidney]]. Into the 17th century, the two Dalhousie Manuscripts are also of literary significance, as they contain the largest sustained contemporary collection of [[John Donne]]’s verse.&lt;ref&gt;Joshua Eckhardt, "Verse Miscellanies, Manuscript" in Garrett A. Sullivan (ed.) ''The Encyclopedia of English Renaissance Literature'', 3 vols. (Oxford: Blackwell, 2012), III, 1002-1006, pp. 1002-1003.&lt;/ref&gt; Although fewer [[medieval literature|medieval]] verse miscellanies have been preserved, the Auchinleck Manuscript survives as a good example: it was produced in London in the 1330s and offers a rare snapshot of pre-[[Geoffrey Chaucer|Chaucerian]] [[Middle English literature|Middle English]] poetry.&lt;ref&gt;David Burnley and Alison Wiggins (eds.),[http://auchinleck.nls.uk/index.html ''The Auchinleck Manuscript''], National Library of Scotland (5 July 2003). [http://auchinleck.nls.uk/editorial/importance.html The Importance of the Auchinleck Manuscript]. Retrieved April 18, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; However, most surviving manuscript verse miscellanies are from the 17th century:

{{quote|[A]s far as ‘literary’ manuscripts are concerned, there are more surviving manuscripts from the seventeenth century than from the sixteenth: of the approximately 230 pre-1640 surviving manuscript collections of poetry that were not single-author collections only 27 belong to the sixteenth century.&lt;ref&gt;Harold Love and Arthur F. Marotti, "Manuscript Transmission and Circulation" in David Loewenstein, Janel M Mueller (eds.), ''The Cambridge History of Early Modern English Literature'' (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 2003), 55-80, p. 62.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Printed verse miscellanies arose in the latter half of the 16th century, during the reign of [[Elizabeth I]] (1558–1603). One of the most influential [[English Renaissance]] verse miscellanies was [[Richard Tottel]]’s ''Songes and Sonettes'', now better known as ''[[Tottel's Miscellany]]''. First printed in 1557, it ran into nine further editions before 1587; it was not then printed again until the 18th century.&lt;ref&gt;Matthew Zarnowiecki, "Verse Miscellanies, Printed" in Garrett A. Sullivan (ed.) ''The Encyclopedia of English Renaissance Literature'', 3 vols. (Oxford: Blackwell, 2012), III, 1006-1010, pp. 1006-07.&lt;/ref&gt; Although few new miscellanies emerged during the insurrectionary years of [[James VI and I|James I]] and [[Charles I of England|Charles I]] (1603–1649), there was a resurgence of interest during the [[Restoration (England)|Restoration]] period and 18th century, and the vast majority of printed verse miscellanies originate from this latter period.&lt;ref&gt;Adam Smyth, [http://purl.oclc.org/emls/08-1/smyth.htm "An Online Index of Poetry in Printed Miscellanies, 1640-1682."] ''Early Modern Literary Studies'' 8.1 (May, 2002) 5.1-9. Retrieved April 18, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

The poetry in these miscellanies varied widely in [[List of literary genres|genre]], form, and subject, and would frequently include: love [[Lyric poetry|lyrics]], [[pastoral]]s, [[ode]]s, [[ballad]]s, [[song]]s, [[sonnet]]s, [[satire]]s, [[hymn]]s, [[fable]]s, [[panegyric]]s, [[parodies]], [[epistle]]s, [[elegies]], [[epitaph]]s, and [[epigram]]s, as well as translations into English and [[prologue]]s and [[epilogue]]s from plays. The practice of [[Attribution (copyright)|attributing]] poems in miscellanies was equally varied: sometimes editors would carefully identify authors, but most often the miscellaneous form would allow them to disregard conventions of [[author]]ship. Often authors were indicated by a set of initials, a partial name, or by reference to a previous poem "by the same hand"; equally often there were [[Anonymous work|anonymous]] or [[pseudonym]]ous attributions, as well as misattributions to other authors – or even made-up or deceased persons. Within a miscellany, editors and booksellers would often exercise considerable freedom in reproducing, altering, and extracting texts. Due to early [[Copyright law of the United Kingdom|copyright]] laws, lesser-known authors would regularly play no part in the printing process, receive no remuneration or [[royalties]], and their works could be freely redistributed (and sometimes even [[#Print trade and piracy|pirated]]) once in the public domain.&lt;ref&gt;Manushag N.

[[File:Bog House.jpg|thumb|upright=1.7|Frontispiece and title page to eighteenth-century miscellany|[[Book frontispiece|Frontispiece]] and [[title page]] to ''The Merry Thought: or, The Glass-Window and Bog-house Miscellany'',&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/20535 ''The Merry Thought: or, The Glass-Window and Bog-house Miscellany'']&lt;/ref&gt; which claimed to include "the Lucubrations of the Polite Part of the World, written upon walls, in Bog-Houses" such as the one at left of the tavern shown.]]

Throughout the 18th century, the miscellany was the customary mode through which popular verse and [[occasional poetry]] would be printed, circulated, and consumed. Michael F. Suarez, one of the leading authorities on miscellanies, states:

{{quote|The importance of printed miscellanies is evidenced by the fact that there are some 1,136 surviving verse miscellanies and anthologies (including reprints and separate issues, but excluding songbooks) for the seventy-five years from 1700 to 1774 – more than fifteen per annum.&lt;ref&gt;Michael F. Suarez, ‘Publishing contemporary English literature, 1695–1774’ in Michael F. Suarez, Michael L. Turner (eds.) ''The Cambridge History of the Book in Britain'' (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 2009), Volume 5: 1695-1830, 649-666, p. 658.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Including songbooks, the ''New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature'' lists almost 5000 verse miscellanies which were printed between 1701 and 1800.&lt;ref&gt;George Watson (ed.), ''The New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature'', 5 vols. (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1971), II, cols. 341-429.&lt;/ref&gt; Due to the sheer number and variety of miscellanies printed in the 18th century, there are few generalizations that can be made about them. From the polite ([[Allan Ramsay (poet)|Allan Ramsay]]’s ''The Tea-Table Miscellany'', 1724–27)&lt;ref group="ebook"&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=V7UDAAAAQAAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=why+so+pale+and+wan+fond+lover&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=Hi9oUa_eAZCa0QWZ3oCQCg&amp;ved=0CE4Q6AEwBzhQ#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false Google Books] ''The Tea-Table Miscellany''&lt;/ref&gt; to the partly obscene (''The Merry Thought: or, The Glass-Window and Bog-house Miscellany'', 1731–33)&lt;ref group="ebook"&gt;[http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/20535 Gutenburg] ''The Merry Thought: or, The Glass-Window and Bog-house Miscellany''&lt;/ref&gt; the central purpose behind nearly all printed verse miscellanies was the reader’s entertainment. However, they were also marketed with practical purposes in mind: as educative moral guides (''Miscellanies, Moral and Instructive, in Prose and Verse'', 1787),&lt;ref group="ebook"&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=qp8vAAAAMAAJ&amp;dq=1787+Miscellanies,+moral+and+instructive,+in+prose+and+verse%3B+collected+from+various+authors+for+the+use+of+schools&amp;pg=PR1&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false Google Books] ''Miscellanies, Moral and Instructive, in Prose and Verse''&lt;/ref&gt; as repositories of useful information (''A Miscellany of Ingenious Thoughts and Reflections in Verse and Prose'', 1721–30), as elocutionary aids ([[William Enfield]]’s ''The Speaker'', 1774-1820),&lt;ref group="ebook"&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=dI9HAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PR1&amp;dq=The+speaker;+or+Miscellaneous+pieces:+selected+from+the+best+English+writers&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=utFmUYLMIe2b0wXouIDYCA&amp;ved=0CEUQ6AEwAw Google Books] ''The Speaker''&lt;/ref&gt; and as guides for poetical composition (Edward Bysshe's ''The Art of English Poetry'', 1702–62).&lt;ref group="ebook"&gt;[http://digitalmiscellaniesindex.org/featured/?id=09 Digital Miscellanies Index], ''The Art of English Poetry''&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:NewberyBaseball.jpg|thumb|left|Some miscellanies were even aimed at children, as ''[[A Little Pretty Pocket-Book]]'' (1744) demonstrates. It consists of rhymes and morals for each letter of the alphabet.]]

=== Range of titles and audiences ===

In a competitive market the title of miscellanies was increasingly important. Without a specific selling-point, more generic complications would use catch-all titles as a tactic to familiarise themselves with a wide range of audiences and to appeal to a breadth of tastes. Titles could evoke the ornamental (''The Bouquet: or Blossoms of Fancy'', 1796), the medicinal (''The Merry Companion: or, A Cure for the Spleen'', 1730), the festive or feast (''A Banquet of the Muses: or The Miscellany of Miscellanies'', 1746), the curious (''A Museum for Young Gentlemen and Ladies'', 1751–82),&lt;ref group="ebook"&gt;[http://digitalmiscellaniesindex.org/featured/?id=07 Digital Miscellanies Index], ''A Museum for Young Gentlemen and Ladies''&lt;/ref&gt; and the curatorial (''The Foundling Hospital for Wit'', 1743–64).&lt;ref group="ebook"&gt;[http://digitalmiscellaniesindex.org/featured/?id=03 Digital Miscellanies Index], ''The Foundling Hospital for Wit''&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Variety and popularity ===

Despite these categorizations, miscellanies attempted to appeal to a wide audience by containing a variety of material for different tastes. Although an editor might orient the miscellany towards an intended audience, by nature of the variety of verse a much wider readership would have been possible. One-off, occasional miscellanies might prove popular and warrant further volumes or editions, such as political pamphlets (''Poems on Affairs of State'', 1689-1705),&lt;ref group="ebook"&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=3SYJAAAAQAAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=Poems+on+Affairs+of+State&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=-9VmUcqkGMqp0QWCrICQBg&amp;ved=0CEAQ6AEwAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=Poems%20on%20Affairs%20of%20State&amp;f=false Google Books] ''Poems on Affairs of State''&lt;/ref&gt; resort-based works (''Tunbrigalia: or the Tunbridge Miscellany'', 1712–40), local productions (''[[Ritson's Yorkshire Garland 1809|The Yorkshire Garland]]'', 1788),&lt;ref group="ebook"&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=7VEJAAAAQAAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=The+Yorkshire+Garland+1788&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=n9ZmUbGjBpGT0QXLj4DgAw&amp;ved=0CDYQ6AEwAQ#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false Google Books] ''The Yorkshire Garland''&lt;/ref&gt; and courtly, coterie or collegiate collections ([[Thomas Warton]]’s ''The [[Oxford sausage#History|Oxford Sausage]]: or select poetical pieces written by the most celebrated wits of the University of Oxford'', 1764-80).&lt;ref group="ebook"&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=eecNAAAAQAAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=The+Oxford+Sausage:+or+select+poetical+pieces+written+by+the+most+celebrated+wits+of+the+University+of+Oxford&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=JtdmUZjKDYKn0AWroIHACw&amp;ved=0CDEQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=The%20Oxford%20Sausage%3A%20or%20select%20poetical%20pieces%20written%20by%20the%20most%20celebrated%20wits%20of%20the%20University%20of%20Oxford&amp;f=false Google Books] ''The Oxford Sausage''&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Print trade and piracy ===

Often the commercial success of a miscellany would stimulate the publication of similarly titled, parasitic, and even entirely [[Copyright infringement|pirated]] works. Dublin booksellers, outside the jurisdiction of the [[Statute of Anne]] (1710) which had established copyright in England, could legally reproduce any popular miscellany that they thought would make a profit. [[Robert Dodsley]]’s hugely popular ''Collection of Poems by Several Hands'' (1748)&lt;ref group="ebook"&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=P9gIAAAAQAAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=Collection+of+Poems+by+Several+Hands&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=rddmUdTzNujw0gXVoYCoDg&amp;ved=0CEEQ6AEwAw Google Books] ''Collection of Poems by Several Hands''&lt;/ref&gt; was copied entirely by Dublin booksellers in 1751, though it also underwent other, more minor piracies in the English literary market – such as unauthorized continuations, supplements, or companion texts attempting to exploit the reputation of the original.&lt;ref&gt;Michael F. Suarez, ‘The Production and Consumption of the Eighteenth-Century Poetic Miscellany’ in Isabel Rivers (ed.) ''Books and Their Readers in Eighteenth-century England: New Essays'' (London: Leicester University Press, 2001), 217-251, pp. 227-233.&lt;/ref&gt;

== The decline of verse miscellanies ==
[[File:A Tale of Two Cities, Chapter 1, in All The Year Round.png|thumb|left|alt=Opening chapter of A Tale of Two Cities by Charles Dickens|The famous opening lines of [[A Tale of Two Cities]] in the periodical [[All the Year Round]].]]

=== Changing tastes and technology ===

Although poetry maintained cultural pre-eminence for most of the 18th century, it was at the same time retreating before the advance of prose, and particularly the [[Novel#The rise of the novel|rise of the novel]], as the new dominant form of literary expression in the West.&lt;ref&gt;David Perkins, ''A History of Modern Poetry from the 1890s to the High Modernist Mode'' (London: Belknap Press of Harvard University Press, 1976), p. 12.&lt;/ref&gt; The decline of poetry as the most widely printed format is also partly [[Printing press#Industrial printing presses|technological]]. Lee Erickson argues:

{{quote|Once the materials and means of printing became cheaper, diffuse prose was no longer at a comparative economic disadvantage with compressed poetry. The periodical format, in particular, gave rise to a variety of shorter prose forms that competed for and largely won over the audience for poetry.&lt;ref&gt;Lee Erickson, ''The Economy of Literary Form: English Literature and the Industrialization of Publishing, 1800-1850'' (London: Johns Hopkins Press, 1996), ‘The Poets’ Corner: The Impact of Technological Changes in Printing on English Poetry’, 19-48, pp. 47-48.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Miscellanies however remained popular throughout the 19th century, especially what came to be known as the “weekly news miscellany, which typically appeared at the weekend and featured not only a summary of the week’s intelligence but also a variety of instructive and entertaining matter”, in other words what we call today a [[magazine]], but poetry was no longer privileged among these publications.&lt;ref&gt;Graham Law and Robert L. Patten, ‘The Serial Revolution’ in David McKitterick (ed.) ''The Cambridge History of the Book'' (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 2009), Volume 6: 1830-1914, 144-171, p. 155.&lt;/ref&gt; Verse miscellanies slowly died out in the [[Victorian era]], as literary miscellanies made possible the [[Serial (literature)|serial publication]] of novels, such as [[William Harrison Ainsworth]]’s ''[[Jack Sheppard (novel)|Jack Sheppard]]'' (1839-40) or [[Charles Dickens]]’ ''[[A Tale of Two Cities]]'' (1859) which was published in 31 weekly instalments in his literary periodical ''[[All the Year Round]]''. There were few, if any, miscellanies devoted to poetry. Instead, verse would be the minority of content, in order to provide variety from the extensive prose:

{{quote|[S]erial fiction became an increasingly popular ingredient of these miscellanies, [but] the syndicators often began by supplying metropolitan advertising and intelligence, and soon also provided regular features such as poetry and critical essays, or columns aimed at women and children.&lt;ref&gt;Law and Patten, 'The Serial Revolution', p. 158&lt;/ref&gt;}}
[[File:Works of the English Poets, v. 18, title page.jpg|thumb|alt=title page of Chalmers' Works of the English Poets|[[Title page]] of [[Alexander Chalmers]]' ''Works of the English Poets'', volume 18.]]

=== Succession of the anthology ===
{{See also|Anthology}}

In the wake of collections such as [[Robert Anderson (editor and biographer)|Robert Anderson]]’s ''Works of the British Poets'' (thirteen vols., 1792-95) and [[Alexander Chalmers]]’ ''Works of the English Poets'' (twenty-one vols., 1810), anthologies were increasingly adopted for the publication of assorted poems. Barbara M. Benedict argues:

{{quote|As readers and publishers matured in the eighteenth century, however, another form appeared that challenged the dominance of the miscellany: the ‘anthology’, a comprehensive selection of the best fashionable verse.&lt;ref&gt;Barbara M. Benedict, ‘Collecting and the Anthology in Early Modern Culture’ in Barbara Korte, Ralf Schneider, and Stefanie Lethbridge (eds.), ''Anthologies of British Poetry: Critical Perspectives from Literary and Cultural Studies'' (Amsterdam: Rodopi, 2001), 43-55, pp. 44-45.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Printing technologies and the rise of the novel played an important role in reshaping the nature of miscellanies, as did changing ideas about the [[British literature|native literary canon]]. Attempts to construct a credible canon of English verse had been ongoing since the early 18th century, and with its success the place of poetry was determined by the advent of authoritative anthologies which claimed to represent the very best of the English poetic tradition.&lt;ref&gt;Jonathan Brody Kramnick, ''Making the English Canon: Print-Capitalism and the Cultural Past, 1700–1770'' (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1998), pp. 1-14.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Significance and recognition ==

In contrast to [[Anthology|anthologies]], whose aim is to give a canonical history of literature, miscellanies tend to reflect the dynamic literary culture of the time in which they were produced. As Michael F. Suarez states:

{{quote|Miscellanies are usually compilations of relatively recent texts designed to suit contemporary tastes; anthologies, in contrast, are generally selections of canonical texts which have a more established history and a greater claim to cultural importance. The miscellany, then, typically celebrates – and indeed constructs – taste, novelty and contemporaneity in assembling a synchronous body of material. It should be distinguished from the anthology, which honours – and perpetuates – the value of historicity and the perdurance of established canons of artistic discrimination in gathering texts recognized for their aesthetic legitimacy.&lt;ref&gt;Suarez, ‘Poetic Miscellany’, pp. 218–9.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

There are modifications to this definition, such as the argument that miscellanies could contain elements that might be considered anthological (the inclusion of [[Culture of ancient Rome#Literature|classical]] literary pieces for example) or could be republished years later when their original contents had matured in literary value.&lt;ref&gt;Jennifer Batt, ‘Eighteenth-Century Verse Miscellanies’ in ''Literature Compass'' 9/6 (2012), 394-405, p. 395.&lt;/ref&gt; Suarez also notes that eighteenth-century miscellanies often contained “extracts from a variety of single-author publications” and, furthermore, that “many miscellanies appropriated select pieces from earlier poetry collections, thus forming what were essentially anthologies of miscellanies.”&lt;ref&gt;Suarez, ‘Poetic Miscellany’, p. 225.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== The literary marketplace ===

It is generally accepted{{clarify|date=May 2013}} that miscellanies offer insight into the popular taste of the moment, of what people read and how they read it; yet they also provide information about the [[Aesthetics|aesthetic]], [[Sociology of literature|social]] and [[Economics|economic]] concerns underlying the production and consumption of literature. Miscellanies were assembled, marketed and sold with a contemporary reading audience in mind, and reveal a dynamic between the taste which they played a part in shaping, and the preoccupations of the [[Editing|editors]] who complied and the [[Publishing#Publishing as a business|publishers]] who sold them. Indeed, the range of price and format reveals the extent to which poetry was packaged and sold for different readerships. As Jennifer Batt argues:

{{quote|The contents and omissions, the packaging and marketing, the publication history, and the reception history of every verse collection produced in the 18th century reveals how literary culture was conceived of by its creators and how those creators wished to intervene in the literary marketplace.&lt;ref&gt;Batt, ‘Verse Miscellanies’, p. 397.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Miscellanies frequently placed emphasis on variety, novelty and fashionability, providing their readers with a range of different pieces by various writers, but also keeping them abreast of the newest developments in the literary market. They are a prime demonstration of early [[marketing]] and [[advertising]] techniques in literature.

=== Contemporary importance and influence ===

Miscellanies were an influential literary form at the time. From the beginning of the 18th century, verse miscellanies were gathering together a selection of poetic works by different authors, past and present, and so played a part in the development of the concept of the [[British literature|English canon]]. These literary miscellanies might be sold as unique collections, arising from the combinations of writers in a small literary circle; or their function could attempt to be more national and historical, by representing the finest works of British poets to date. The multiple editions of the [[John Dryden|Dryden]]-[[Jacob Tonson|Tonson]] ''Miscellany Poems'' (1684-1708)&lt;ref group="ebook"&gt;[http://digitalmiscellaniesindex.org/featured/?id=06 Digital Miscellanies Index], ''Miscellany Poems''&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[Jonathan Swift|Swift]]-[[Alexander Pope|Pope]] ''Miscellanies'' (1727–32),&lt;ref group="ebook"&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=zwsUAAAAQAAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=Swift-Pope+Miscellanies&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=EdpmUaKcMLK00QX1rYDQCg&amp;ved=0CDIQ6AEwAA Google Books] ''Miscellanies''&lt;/ref&gt; as well as ''The Muses Library'' (1737)&lt;ref group="ebook"&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=p5QrAQAAMAAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=The+Muses+Library+(1737&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=fNpmUfHGK-nL0QXmu4Ao&amp;ved=0CC8Q6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false Google Books]''The Muses Library''&lt;/ref&gt; and ''The British Muse'' (1738),&lt;ref group="ebook"&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=TXKsQdoVOj4C&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=British+Muse+(1738&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=zNpmUcqEEaS40QWj-oC4DA&amp;ved=0CC8Q6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false Google Books] ''The British Muse''&lt;/ref&gt; were from early on attempting to construct a notion of a national literary heritage.&lt;ref&gt;Kramnick, ''Making the English Canon'', pp. 20-21.&lt;/ref&gt; The revival of interest in English balladry is also largely due to miscellanies, most famously [[Thomas Percy (bishop of Dromore)|Thomas Percy]]’s ''[[Reliques of Ancient English Poetry]]'' (1765).&lt;ref group="ebook"&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=ZhBNAAAAcAAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=Reliques+of+Ancient+English+Poetry+(1765).&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=D9tmUe2UManB0gWk_4GwDA&amp;ved=0CD8Q6AEwAw#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false Google Books] ''Reliques of Ancient English Poetry''&lt;/ref&gt;  Miscellanies also played a part in the development of other literary forms, particularly the novel. Since so many collections included prose extracts alongside poetry, often from eighteenth-century novels such as Laurence Sterne’s ''[[The Life and Opinions of Tristram Shandy, Gentleman|Tristram Shandy]]'' (1759), it is arguable they aided the popularisation of novels. [[Leah Price]]’s ''The Anthology and the Rise of the Novel'' (2000), in particular, discusses the relationship between miscellanies and prose fiction in the latter half of the 18th century.

=== Submerged voices and marginal writing ===

Because of the variety and novelty they emphasise, as well as the [[anonymity]] of authorship they could offer, miscellanies often enabled the inclusion and so expression of more submerged voices, such as those of women, and more marginal forms of writing, such as the comic, the curious, and the crude. As Dustin Griffin has noted:

{{quote|For most other poets, women especially, publication in a miscellany was the only way in which their work might reach the public. Many other ephemeral satirical poems, circulating as broadsheets or in manuscript, were gathered in the successive editions of ''Poems on Affairs of State'' (1689–1705).&lt;ref&gt;Dustin Griffin, ‘The Social World of Authorship 1660-1714’ in John Richetti (ed.) ''The Cambridge History of English Literature'' (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 2005), 37-60, p. 41.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Many miscellanies contained exclusively the [[Women's writing in English|writing of women]], most famously ''Poems by Eminent Ladies'' (1755)&lt;ref group="ebook"&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=bkkJAAAAQAAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=Poems+by+Eminent+Ladies+(1755&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=j9tmUYHwM8Ok0QWq0IDABA&amp;ved=0CD4Q6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false Google Books] ''Poems by Eminent Ladies''&lt;/ref&gt; – a collection of verse by 18 women poets including [[Aphra Behn]], [[Elizabeth Carter]], [[Mary Leapor]], [[Anne Finch, Countess of Winchilsea|Anne Finch]], [[Katherine Philips]], [[Margaret Cavendish, Duchess of Newcastle-upon-Tyne|Margaret Cavendish]], [[Mary Monck]], [[Lady Mary Chudleigh]], and [[Mary Barber (poet)|Mary Barber]] – and recently critics have brought to light the ways in which such women made a key contribution to the miscellany culture of the 18th century.&lt;ref&gt;Chantal Lavoie, ''Collecting Women: Poetry and Lives 1700–1780'' (Lewisburg, Pa.: Bucknell University Press, 2009).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Margaret Ezell, ''Writing Women’s Literary History'' (Baltimore: Johns Hopkins University Press, 1993).&lt;/ref&gt; The ''Perdita Project'' provides the fullest evidence of women’s role in manuscript miscellanies in the period 1500-1700.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.amdigital.co.uk/m-collections/collection/perdita-manuscripts-1500-1700/ Perdita Manuscripts], [http://web.warwick.ac.uk/english/perdita/html/ Index of Perdita Women]&lt;/ref&gt;[[File:On a Lady's Muff.jpg|thumb|At the other extreme, a [[Sexual objectification|sexually objectifying]] poem from [https://archive.org/stream/fugitivemiscella02almo#page/168/mode/2up ''The Fugitive Miscellany''] playing [[Euphemism|euphemistically]] on a ladies' fashion accessory, the [[Muff (handwarmer)|"muff"]].]]

Miscellanies also presented themselves as performing an important cultural or curatorial role, by preserving [[Bookbinding|unbound]] sheets, [[Literary fragment|fragments]] and [[ephemera]] which otherwise would have been lost – and thus offering a unique insight into the vibrant literary life of the 18th century. A prime example of such curiosity-shop publications is ''The fugitive miscellany: a collection of fugitive pieces in prose and verse'' (1774),&lt;ref group="ebook"&gt;[https://archive.org/details/fugitivemiscella02almo Internet Archive] ''The fugitive miscellany. Being a collection of such fugitive pieces, in prose and verse, as are not in any other collection. With many pieces never before published.'' 2 vols. (London, 1774). [[English Short Title Catalogue|ESTC]] T118867&lt;/ref&gt; which includes nonsense rhymes, epitaphs, inscriptions, poems made out of newspaper cuttings, as well as wills written in verse. [[Literary criticism#The current state of literary criticism|Late twentieth-century criticism]] has drawn attention to the cultural and literary importance of these non-canonical, lesser-known and ephemeral kinds of popular verse – such as the recent discovery of a poem spuriously attributed to John Milton, “[[An Extempore upon a Faggot]]”.&lt;ref&gt;The Bodliean Library, [http://www.bodleian.ox.ac.uk/bodley/news/2010_sept_23 'Archive of irreverent miscellanies put online']. 23 September 2010. Retrieved April 18, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;  As the most prolific source of anonymous or pseudonymous publication, miscellanies provide insight into the unconventional history of English literature. [[Roger Lonsdale]] notes in his influential anthology, ''The New Oxford Book of Eighteenth-Century Verse'' (1984): “One of the most interesting poets [from this period] is the ubiquitous ‘Anonymous’, whose voice almost never registers in conventional literary history”. Crucially, he suggests that we would know more about “the landscape of eighteenth-century poetry” if more attention was paid to “the innumerable miscellanies by several hands”.&lt;ref&gt;Roger Lonsdale (ed.) ''The New Oxford Book of Eighteenth-Century Verse'' (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 1984), pp. xxxix, xxv.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Literary criticism and research projects ==

It is now widely accepted by literary critics that paying attention to forms of access to literature, and to the [[Reception theory|reception history]] of individual works and authors, is an important part of the history of literary culture. In this context, the miscellany has grown rapidly in interest in eighteenth-century studies. As Jennifer Batt states:

{{quote|The study of miscellanies has become vibrant in recent years, encouraged by controversies about canon formation as well as by the growth of interest in reception history, the history of reading and the history of the book.&lt;ref&gt;Batt, ‘Verse Miscellanies’, p. 395.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

In light of such developments there have arisen projects attempting to make the vast number and array of verse miscellanies more accessible to modern researchers and readers, most prominently through the process of online [[Digitizing#Literary preservation|digitization]]. In 2012 [http://versemiscellaniesonline.bodleian.ox.ac.uk/ ''Verse Miscellanies Online''] was launched, which offers a searchable critical edition of seven printed verse miscellanies published in the 16th and early 17th centuries. While some projects focus on creating online editions of the most significant verse miscellanies, others have attempted to arrange a corpus of miscellanies produced in set periods, such as [http://scriptorium.english.cam.ac.uk/ ''Scriptorium: Medieval and Early Modern Manuscripts Online''] (2006-2009), a digital archive of manuscript miscellanies and commonplace books from c. 1450-1720. The largest undertaking by far has been [http://digitalmiscellaniesindex.org/ ''The Digital Miscellanies Index''], an ongoing project funded by the [[Leverhulme Trust]].  The ''Index'' seeks to create a freely available online database of the 1000-plus verse miscellanies published in the 18th century, based on a comprehensive bibliography compiled by Michael F. Suarez, and supplied by the world’s single largest collection of miscellanies held in The [[Bodleian Library]]’s Harding Collection.&lt;ref&gt;The [[Bodleian Library]], [http://www.bodleian.ox.ac.uk/news/ragtime-to-riches 'Ragtime to riches, a musical legacy at the Bodleian Library']. 10 January 2010.

'''Philip Milton Roth''' (March 19, 1933 – May 22, 2018) was an American novelist and short-story writer.

Roth's fiction, regularly set in his birthplace of [[Newark, New Jersey]], is known for its intensely autobiographical character, for philosophically and formally blurring the distinction between reality and fiction, for its "sensual, ingenious style" and for its provocative explorations of [[American identity]].&lt;ref&gt;U.S. Department of State, U.S. Life, [http://infousa.state.gov/life/artsent/oal/lit8.html "American Prose, 1945–1990: Realism and Experimentation"] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110304074205/http://infousa.state.gov/life/artsent/oal/lit8.html |date=March 4, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  

Roth first gained attention with the 1959 [[novella]] ''[[Goodbye, Columbus]]'', for which he received the U.S. [[National Book Award for Fiction]].&lt;ref name=nba1960/&gt;&lt;ref name="Brauner"&gt;Brauner (2005), pp. 43–7&lt;/ref&gt; He became one of the most awarded American writers of his generation. His books twice received the [[National Book Award]] and the [[National Book Critics Circle]] award, and three times the [[PEN/Faulkner Award]]. He received a [[Pulitzer Prize for Fiction|Pulitzer Prize]] for his 1997 novel ''[[American Pastoral]]'', which featured one of his best-known characters, [[Nathan Zuckerman]], a character in many of Roth's novels. ''[[The Human Stain]]'' (2000), another Zuckerman novel, was awarded the United Kingdom's [[WH Smith Literary Award]] for the best book of the year. In 2001, in [[Prague]], Roth received the inaugural [[Franz Kafka Prize]].

==Early life and academic pursuits==
{{refimprove section|date=May 2018}}
Philip Roth was born in [[Newark, New Jersey]], on March 19, 1933,&lt;ref name="writers"&gt;{{cite book|title=Merriam-Webster's Dictionary of [[American literature|American writers]]|year=2001|page=350|isbn=978-0-87779-022-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; and grew up in its [[Weequahic, Newark|Weequahic]] neighborhood.&lt;ref name="writers"/&gt; He was the second child of Bess (née Finkel) and Herman Roth, an insurance broker.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=eTslryuJyrwC&amp;pg=PA23&amp;dq=Herman%20Bess%20(Finkel)%20Roth&amp;hl=en|title=Up Society's Ass, Copper: Rereading Philip Roth|first=Mark|last=Shechner|date=January 1, 2003|publisher=Univ of Wisconsin Press|via=Google Books}}&lt;/ref&gt; Roth's family was [[American Jews|Jewish]], and his parents were second-generation Americans. Roth's father's parents came from Kozlov near [[Lviv]] / Lemberg in [[Galicia (Eastern Europe)|Galicia]]; his mother's ancestors were from the region of [[Kiev]]. He graduated from Newark's [[Weequahic High School]] in or around 1950.&lt;ref&gt;Lubasch, Arnold H. [https://www.nytimes.com/books/97/04/20/reviews/roth-highschool.html "Philip Roth Shakes Weequahic High"], ''[[The New York Times]],'' February 28, 1969. Accessed September 8, 2007&lt;/ref&gt; As Arnold H. Lubasch wrote in the ''[[New York Times]]'' in 1969, "It has provided the focus for the fiction of Philip Roth, the novelist who evokes his era at Weequahic High School in the highly acclaimed ''[[Portnoy's Complaint]]''.... Besides identifying Weequahic High School by name, the novel specifies such sites as the Empire Burlesque, the Weequahic Diner, the [[Newark Museum]] and Irvington Park, all local landmarks that helped shape the youth of the real Roth and the fictional Portnoy, both graduates of Weequahic class of '50." The ''Weequahic Yearbook'' (1950) describes Roth as "A boy of real intelligence, combined with wit and common sense." He was known as a comedian during his time at school.&lt;ref&gt;''Weequahic Yearbook'' (1950)&lt;/ref&gt; Roth attended [[Rutgers University]] in Newark for a year, then transferred to [[Bucknell University]] in [[Pennsylvania]], where he earned a [[B.A.]], [[magna cum laude]] in English and was elected to [[Phi Beta Kappa]]. He received a scholarship to attend the [[University of Chicago]], where he earned an [[Master of Arts|M.A.]] in [[English literature]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://chicago.suntimes.com/entertainment/here-are-5-essential-works-of-fiction-by-philip-roth-to-remember-him-by/|title=Here are 5 essential works of fiction by Philip Roth to remember him by|publisher=|accessdate=May 28, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; in 1955 and worked briefly as an instructor in the university's writing program.&lt;ref name="israelnationalnews.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.israelnationalnews.com/News/News.aspx/246318|title=Jewish American author Philip Roth dies at 85|website=Israel National News|accessdate=May 28, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; That same year, rather than wait to be drafted, Roth enlisted in the army, but he suffered a back injury during basic training and was given a medical discharge. He returned to Chicago in 1956 to study for a PhD in Literature but dropped out after one term.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2018/05/22/obituaries/philip-roth-dead.html?rref=collection%2Ftimestopic%2FRoth%2C%20Philip&amp;action=click&amp;contentCollection=timestopics&amp;region=stream&amp;module=stream_unit&amp;version=latest&amp;contentPlacement=8&amp;pgtype=collection|title=Philip Roth, Towering Novelist Who Explored Lust, Jewish Life and America, Dies at 85|last=McGrath|first=Charles|date=May 22, 2018|work=The New York Times|access-date=June 12, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Roth taught creative writing at the [[University of Iowa]] and [[Princeton University]]. He later continued his academic career at the [[University of Pennsylvania]], where he taught comparative literature before retiring from teaching in 1991.&lt;ref name="israelnationalnews.com"/&gt; Between the end of his studies and the publication of his first book in 1959, Roth served two years in the [[United States Army]] and then wrote short fiction and criticism for various magazines, including movie reviews for ''[[The New Republic]].''

==Writing career==
Roth's work first appeared in print in the ''[[Chicago Review]]'' while he was studying, and later teaching, at the [[University of Chicago]].&lt;ref&gt;Roth, Philip. "The Day It Snowed."&amp;nbsp;''Chicago Review'', vol. 8, no. 4, 1954, pp. 34–44.&amp;nbsp;JSTOR, www.jstor.org/stable/25293074.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Roth, Philip. "Mrs. Lindbergh, Mr. Ciardi, and the Teeth and Claws of the Civilized World."&amp;nbsp;''Chicago Review'', vol. 11, no. 2, 1957, pp. 72–76.&amp;nbsp;JSTOR, www.jstor.org/stable/25293349.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Roth, Philip. "Positive Thinking on Pennsylvania Avenue."&amp;nbsp;''Chicago Review'', vol. 11, no. 1, 1957, pp. 21–24.&amp;nbsp;JSTOR, www.jstor.org/stable/25293295.&lt;/ref&gt; His first book, ''[[Goodbye, Columbus]]'', contains the novella ''Goodbye, Columbus'' and four short stories. It won the [[National Book Award]] in 1960. He published his first full-length novel, ''[[Letting Go (novel)|Letting Go,]]'' in 1962. In 1967 he published ''[[When She Was Good]]'', set in the WASP Midwest in the 1940s. It is based in part on the life of Margaret Martinson Williams, whom Roth married in 1959.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The publication in 1969 of his fourth and most controversial novel, ''[[Portnoy's Complaint]]'', gave Roth widespread commercial and critical success, causing his profile to rise significantly.&lt;ref name="Brauner"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Saxton"&gt;Saxton (1974)&lt;/ref&gt; During the 1970s Roth experimented in various modes, from the political satire ''[[Our Gang (novel)|Our Gang]]'' to the [[Franz Kafka|Kafkaesque]] ''[[The Breast]]''. By the end of the decade Roth had created his alter ego Nathan Zuckerman. In a series of highly self-referential novels and novellas that followed between 1979 and 1986, Zuckerman appeared as either the main character or an interlocutor. 

''[[Sabbath's Theater]]'' (1995) may have Roth's most lecherous protagonist, Mickey Sabbath, a disgraced former puppeteer; it won his second [[National Book Award]].&lt;ref name=nba1995 /&gt; In complete contrast, ''[[American Pastoral]]'' (1997), the first volume of his so-called second Zuckerman trilogy, focuses on the life of virtuous Newark star athlete Swede Levov, and the tragedy that befalls him when Levov's teenage daughter becomes a domestic terrorist during the late 1960s; it won the [[Pulitzer Prize for Fiction]].&lt;ref name=pulitzer /&gt; ''[[I Married a Communist]]'' (1998) focuses on the [[Joe McCarthy|McCarthy]] era. ''[[The Human Stain]]'' examines [[identity politics]] in 1990s America. ''[[The Dying Animal]]'' (2001) is a short novel about [[eros]] and death that revisits literary professor David Kepesh, protagonist of two 1970s works, ''[[The Breast]]'' and ''[[The Professor of Desire]]''. In ''[[The Plot Against America]]'' (2004), Roth imagines an alternative American history in which [[Charles Lindbergh]], aviator hero and isolationist, is elected U.S. president in 1940, and the U.S. negotiates an understanding with Hitler's Nazi Germany and embarks on its own program of anti-Semitism.

Roth's novel ''[[Everyman (novel)|Everyman]]'', a meditation on illness, aging, desire, and death, was published in May 2006.  For ''Everyman'' Roth won his third [[PEN/Faulkner Award]], making him the only person so honored. ''[[Exit Ghost]]'', which again features Nathan Zuckerman, was released in October 2007.  It was the last Zuckerman novel.&lt;ref&gt;"[https://www.nytimes.com/2006/11/30/books/30roth.html Zuckerman’s Last Hurrah]." ''[[New York Times]]''. November 30, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Indignation (novel)|Indignation]]'', Roth's 29th book, was published on September 16, 2008. Set in 1951, during the [[Korean War]], it follows Marcus Messner's departure from Newark to Ohio's Winesburg College, where he begins his sophomore year. In 2009, Roth's 30th book, ''[[The Humbling]]'', was published. It tells the story of the last performances of Simon Axler, a celebrated stage actor. Roth's 31st book, ''[[Nemesis (Philip Roth novel)|Nemesis]]'', was published on October 5, 2010. According to the book's notes, ''[[Nemesis (Philip Roth novel)|Nemesis]]'' is the last in a series of four "short novels," after ''[[Everyman (novel)|Everyman]]'', ''[[Indignation (novel)|Indignation]]'' and ''[[The Humbling]]''.
In October 2009, during an interview with [[Tina Brown]] of ''The Daily Beast'' to promote ''The Humbling'', Roth considered the future of literature and its place in society, stating his belief that within 25 years the reading of novels will be regarded as a "cultic" activity:

&lt;blockquote&gt;I was being optimistic about 25 years really. I think it's going to be cultic. I think always people will be reading them but it will be a small group of people. Maybe more people than now read Latin poetry, but somewhere in that range. ... To read a novel requires a certain amount of concentration, focus, devotion to the reading. If you read a novel in more than two weeks you don't read the novel really. So I think that kind of concentration and focus and attentiveness is hard to come by—it's hard to find huge numbers of people, large numbers of people, significant numbers of people, who have those qualities[.]&lt;ref name="guardian.co.uk"&gt;{{cite news |newspaper=The Guardian |location=London |title= Philip Roth predicts novel will be minority cult within 25 years |date=October 26, 2009 |first=Alison |last=Flood |url=https://www.theguardian.com/books/2009/oct/26/philip-roth-novel-minority-cult}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

When asked about the prospects for printed versus digital books, Roth was equally downbeat:

&lt;blockquote&gt;The book can't compete with the screen. It couldn't compete [in the] beginning with the movie screen. It couldn't compete with the television screen, and it can't compete with the computer screen. ... Now we have all those screens, so against all those screens a book couldn't measure up.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Philip Roth Unbound: The Full Interview |first=Tina |last=Brown |work=The Daily Beast |url=http://www.thedailybeast.com/blogs-and-stories/2009-10-21/philip-roth-unbound-the-full-interview |date=October 21, 2009 |accessdate=March 2, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

This was not the first time Roth had expressed pessimism about the future of the novel and its significance in recent years. Talking to the ''Observer''{{'}}s Robert McCrum in 2001, he said, "I'm not good at finding 'encouraging' features in American culture. I doubt that aesthetic literacy has much of a future here."&lt;ref name="guardian.co.uk" /&gt; In an October 2012 interview with the French magazine ''[[Les Inrockuptibles]]'', Roth announced that he would be retiring from writing&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.newyorker.com/online/blogs/books/2012/11/philip-roth-retires-from-novels.html Philip Roth retires from novels]. [[The New Yorker]] 2012-11.&lt;/ref&gt; and confirmed subsequently in ''[[Le Monde]]'' that he would no longer publish fiction.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lemonde.fr/livres/article/2013/02/14/philip-roth-i-don-t-wish-to-be-a-slave-any-longer-to-the-stringent-exigencies-of-literature_1831662_3260.html Philip Roth : "I don't wish to be a slave any longer to the stringent exigencies of literature"].  Josyane Savigneau, ''[[Le Monde]]''. February 14, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; In May 2014, Roth claimed in an interview with [[Alan Yentob]] for the [[BBC]] that "this is my last appearance on television, my absolutely last appearance on any stage anywhere."&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/books/2014/may/17/philip-roth-retires-imagine-interview Bye-bye ... Philip Roth talks of fame, sex and growing old in last interview].  Robert McCrum, ''[[The Guardian]]''. May 17, 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Influences and themes==
Much of Roth's fiction revolves around semi-autobiographical themes, while self-consciously and playfully addressing the perils of establishing connections between Roth and his fictional lives and voices.&lt;ref name = "Berlinerblau"&gt;{{Cite news|issn=0009-5982|last=Berlinerblau|first=Jacques|title=Do We Know Philip Roth?|work=The Chronicle of Higher Education|accessdate=April 7, 2014|date=April 7, 2014|url=http://chronicle.com/article/Do-We-Know-Philip-Roth-/145671/}}&lt;/ref&gt; Examples of this close relationship between the author's life and his characters' include narrators and protagonists such as David Kepesh and [[Nathan Zuckerman]] as well as the character "Philip Roth", who appears in ''[[The Plot Against America]]'' and of whom there are two in ''[[Operation Shylock]]''. Critic Jacques Berlinerblau noted in ''[[The Chronicle of Higher Education]]'' that these fictional voices create a complex and tricky experience for readers, deceiving them into believing they "know" Roth.&lt;ref name = "Berlinerblau"/&gt; In Roth's fiction, the question of authorship is intertwined with the theme of the idealistic, secular Jewish son who attempts to distance himself from Jewish customs and traditions, and from what he perceives as the sometimes suffocating influence of parents, rabbis, and other community leaders.&lt;ref name ="GreenbergP11" /&gt; Roth's fiction has been described by critics as pervaded by "a kind of alienation that is enlivened and exacerbated by what binds it".&lt;ref name="GreenbergP11"&gt;Greenberg, Robert M. (Winter 1997) [https://web.archive.org/web/20150904132552/http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m0403/is_n4_v43/ai_20614549/pg_11/ "Transgression in the Fiction of Philip Roth".] ''Twentieth Century Literature''. Archived March 20, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

Roth's first work, ''[[Goodbye, Columbus]]'', was an irreverently humorous depiction of the life of middle-class Jewish Americans, and met controversy among reviewers, who were highly polarized in their judgments;&lt;ref name="Brauner"/&gt; one criticized it as infused with a sense of self-loathing. In response, Roth, in his 1963 essay "Writing About Jews" (collected in ''Reading Myself and Others''), maintained that he wanted to explore the conflict between the call to Jewish solidarity and his desire to be free to question the values and morals of middle-class Jewish Americans uncertain of their identities in an era of cultural assimilation and upward social mobility:
&lt;blockquote&gt;The cry 'Watch out for the goyim!' at times seems more the expression of an unconscious wish than of a warning: Oh that they were out there, so that we could be together here! A rumor of persecution, a taste of exile, might even bring with it the old world of feelings and habits—something to replace the new world of social accessibility and moral indifference, the world which tempts all our promiscuous instincts, and where one cannot always figure out what a Jew is that a Christian is not.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Roth |first=Philip |date=December 1963 |title=Writing About Jews |journal=[[Commentary (magazine)|Commentary]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In Roth's fiction, the exploration of "promiscuous instincts" within the context of Jewish lives, mainly from a male viewpoint, plays an important role. In the words of critic [[Hermione Lee]]:
&lt;blockquote&gt;Philip Roth's fiction strains to shed the burden of Jewish traditions and proscriptions. ... The liberated Jewish consciousness, let loose into the disintegration of the American Dream, finds itself deracinated and homeless. American society and politics, by the late sixties, are a grotesque travesty of what Jewish immigrants had traveled towards: liberty, peace, security, a decent liberal democracy.&lt;ref name="Lee"&gt;Lee, Hermione (1982). ''Philip Roth''. New York: Methuen &amp; Co., 1982.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

While Roth's fiction has strong autobiographical influences, it also incorporates social commentary and political satire, most obviously in ''[[Our Gang (novel)|Our Gang]]'' and ''[[Operation Shylock]]''. From the 1990s on Roth's fiction often combined autobiographical elements with retrospective dramatizations of postwar American life. Roth described ''[[American Pastoral]]'' and the two following novels as a loosely connected "American trilogy". Each of these novels treats aspects of the postwar era against the backdrop of the nostalgically remembered Jewish-American childhood of Nathan Zuckerman, in which the experience of life on [[United States home front during World War II|the American home front during the Second World War]] features prominently.{{Citation needed|date=October 2009}}

In much of Roth's fiction, the 1940s, comprising Roth's and Zuckerman's childhood, mark a high point of American idealism and social cohesion. A more satirical treatment of the patriotism and idealism of the war years is evident in Roth's comic novels, such as ''[[Portnoy's Complaint]]'' and ''[[Sabbath's Theater]]''. In ''[[The Plot Against America]]'', the [[alternate history]] of the war years dramatizes the prevalence of [[anti-Semitism]] and racism in America at the time, despite the promotion of increasingly influential anti-racist ideals during the war. In his fiction, Roth portrayed the 1940s, and the [[New Deal]] era of the 1930s that preceded it, as a heroic phase in American history. A sense of frustration with social and political developments in the United States since the 1940s is palpable in the American trilogy and ''[[Exit Ghost]]'', but had already been present in Roth's earlier works that contained political and social satire, such as ''[[Our Gang (novel)|Our Gang]]'' and ''[[The Great American Novel (Roth)|The Great American Novel]]''. Writing about the latter, Hermione Lee points to the sense of disillusionment with "the American Dream" in Roth's fiction: "The mythic words on which Roth's generation was brought up—winning, patriotism, gamesmanship—are desanctified; greed, fear, racism, and political ambition are disclosed as the motive forces behind the 'all-American ideals'."&lt;ref name="Lee" /&gt;

Although Roth's writings often explored the Jewish experience in America, Roth rejected being labeled a [[American Jews|Jewish-American]] writer. “It’s not a question that interests me. I know exactly what it means to be Jewish and it’s really not interesting,” he told the [[The Guardian|Guardian newspaper]] in 2005. “I’m an American.”&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-people-philiproth/pulitzer-winning-author-philip-roth-dies-at-85-says-agent-idUSKCN1IO0CM|title=Pulitzer-winning author Philip Roth dies at 85, says agent|last=Editorial|first=Reuters|work=U.S.|access-date=2018-05-26|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Personal life==
While at [[University of Chicago|Chicago]], Roth met the novelist [[Saul Bellow]], as well as Margaret Martinson in 1956, who became his first wife in 1959. Their separation in 1963, and Martinson's subsequent death in a car crash in 1968, left a lasting mark on Roth's literary output. Martinson was the inspiration for female characters in several of Roth's novels, including Lucy Nelson in ''[[When She Was Good]]'' and Maureen Tarnopol in ''[[My Life as a Man]].''&lt;ref&gt;Roth, Philip. ''[[The Facts: A Novelist's Autobiography]]''. New York, 1988.  Roth discusses Martinson's portrait in this memoir. He calls her "Josie" in ''[[When She Was Good]]'' on pp. 149 and 175. He discusses her as an inspiration for ''[[My Life as a Man]]'' throughout the book's second half, most completely in the chapter "Girl of My Dreams," which includes this on p. 110: "Why should I have tried to make up anything better? How could I?" Her influence upon ''Portnoy's Complaint'' is seen in ''The Facts'' as more diffuse, a kind of loosening-up for the author:  "It took time and it took blood, and not, really, until I began ''Portnoy's Complaint'' would I be able to cut loose with anything approaching her gift for flabbergasting boldness." (p. 149)&lt;/ref&gt; The pseudo-confessional novel ''[[Operation Shylock]]'' (1993) and other works draw on a [[post-operative]] [[nervous breakdown|breakdown]]&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=j6a0IJjWYe4C&amp;pg=PA5#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false p. 5], Philip Roth, ''The Facts: A Novelist's Autobiography'', Random House, 2011: "I'm talking about a breakdown.

'No, I don't have a religious bone in my body,' Roth said. 'You don't?'  'No.'  'So, do you feel like there's a God out there?' Braver asked. 'I'm afraid there isn't, no,' Roth said. 'You know that telling the whole world that you don't believe in God is going to, you know, have people say, "Oh my goodness, you know, that's a terrible thing for him to say,"' Braver said. Roth replied, 'When the whole world doesn't believe in God, it'll be a great place.'}}&lt;/ref&gt; He also said during an interview with ''[[The Guardian]]'': "I'm exactly the opposite of religious, I'm anti-religious. I find religious people hideous. I hate the religious lies. It's all a big lie," and "It's not a neurotic thing, but the miserable record of religion—I don't even want to talk about it. It's not interesting to talk about the sheep referred to as believers. When I write, I'm alone. It's filled with fear and loneliness and anxiety—and I never needed religion to save me."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/books/2005/dec/14/fiction.philiproth|title='It no longer feels a great injustice that I have to die'|first=Martin|last=Krasnik|date=December 14, 2005|publisher=|via=The Guardian}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1990, Roth married his longtime companion, English actress [[Claire Bloom]], with whom he had been living since 1976. In 1994 they divorced, and in 1996 Bloom published a memoir, ''[[Leaving a Doll's House: A Memoir|Leaving a Doll's House]],'' that depicted Roth as a misogynist and control freak. Some critics have detected parallels between Bloom and the character Eve Frame in Roth's ''[[I Married a Communist]]'' (1998).&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

==Death, burial, and legacy==	
Roth died at a [[Manhattan]] hospital of [[congestive heart failure]] on May 22, 2018, at the age of 85.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-44220189|title=Author Philip Roth dies aged 85|date=2018-05-23|work=BBC News|access-date=2018-05-23|language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2018/05/22/obituaries/philip-roth-dead.html|title=Philip Roth, Towering Novelist Who Explored Lust, Jewish Life and America, Dies at 85|publisher=[[The New York Times]]|date=May 22, 2018|accessdate=May 22, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-44220189|title=American literary giant Philip Roth dies|date=May 23, 2018|publisher=|accessdate=May 28, 2018|via=www.bbc.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Roth was buried at the [[Bard College]] Cemetery in [[Annandale-on-Hudson]], New York, where in 1999 he taught a class. He had originally planned to be buried next to his parents at the Gomel Chesed Cemetery in Newark, but changed his mind about 15 years before his death, in order to be close to his friend the novelist [[Norman Manea]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.haaretz.com/us-news/philip-roth-who-forbade-having-jewish-funeral-to-be-buried-monday-1.6117234|title=Philip Roth, Who 'Forbade' Jewish Rituals at His Funeral, to Be Buried Monday|first=|last=JTA|date=May 26, 2018|publisher=|accessdate=June 24, 2018|via=Haaretz}}&lt;/ref&gt; Roth expressly banned any religious rituals from his funeral service, though it was noted that only one day after his burial a pebble had been placed on top of his tombstone in accordance with [[Bereavement in Judaism|Jewish tradition]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://hudsonvalleyone.com/2018/05/29/philip-roth-is-laid-to-rest-in-annandale/|title=Philip Roth is laid to rest in Annandale|publisher=|accessdate=June 24, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Among the admirers of Roth's work is the singer songwriter, fellow [[List of people from New Jersey|New Jersey native]], and acclaimed celebrant of the state's culture, [[Bruce Springsteen]]. Roth read the musician's autobiography ''[[Born to Run (autobiography)|Born to Run]]'' and Springsteen read Roth's ''American Pastoral'', ''I Married A Communist'', and ''The Human Stain''. Springsteen said of Roth's work: "I'll tell you, those three recent books by Philip Roth just knocked me on my ass... To be in his sixties making work that is so strong, so full of revelations about love and emotional pain, that's the way to live your artistic life. Sustain, sustain, sustain."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/books/2004/sep/26/fiction.philiproth|title=Philip Roth: One angry man|first=Sean|last=O'Hagan|date=September 25, 2004|website=the Guardian|accessdate=May 31, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Two of Roth's works won the [[National Book Award for Fiction]]; four others were finalists.&lt;!-- source is the linked article, easily countable --&gt; Two won [[National Book Critics Circle]] awards; again, another five were finalists.  He has also won three [[PEN/Faulkner Award]]s (''Operation Shylock,'' ''The Human Stain,'' and ''Everyman'') and a Pulitzer Prize for his 1997 novel, ''American Pastoral''.&lt;ref name=pulitzer/&gt; In 2001, ''The Human Stain'' was awarded the United Kingdom's [[WH Smith Literary Award]] for the best book of the year. In 2002, he was awarded the [[National Book Foundation]] [[National Book Award#Medal for Distinguished Contribution to American Letters|Medal for Distinguished Contribution to American Letters.]]&lt;ref name=medal/&gt;

A plaque on the house where the Roths lived was also unveiled.  In May 2006, he was given the [[PEN/Nabokov Award]], and in 2007 he was awarded the PEN/Faulkner award for ''Everyman,'' making him the award's only three-time winner. In April 2007, he was chosen as the recipient of the first [[PEN/Saul Bellow Award for Achievement in American Fiction]].&lt;ref&gt;[[PEN American Center]].

In May 2011, Roth was awarded the [[Man Booker International Prize]] for lifetime achievement in fiction on the world stage, the fourth winner of the biennial prize.&lt;ref name=booker/&gt; One of the judges, [[Carmen Callil]], a publisher of the feminist Virago house, withdrew in protest, referring to Roth's work as "[[The Emperor's New Clothes|Emperor's clothes]]". She said "he goes on and on and on about the same subject in almost every single book. It's as though he's sitting on your face and you can't breathe ... I don’t rate him as a writer at all ...".&lt;ref name="NewYorkerBooker"/&gt; Observers quickly noted that Callil had a conflict of interest, having published a book by [[Claire Bloom]] (Roth's ex-wife) that criticized Roth and lambasted their marriage.&lt;ref name="NewYorkerBooker"&gt;{{cite web|last=Halford|first=Macy|title=Philip Roth and the Booker Judge|publisher=[[The New Yorker]]|date=May 18, 2011|url=http://www.newyorker.com/online/blogs/books/2011/05/philip-roth-and-the-booker-judge.html|accessdate=September 8, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; In response, one of the two other Booker judges, Rick Gekoski, remarked:
&lt;blockquote&gt;In 1959 he writes ''Goodbye, Columbus'' and it's a masterpiece, magnificent. Fifty-one years later he's 78 years old and he writes ''Nemesis'' and it is so wonderful, such a terrific novel ... Tell me one other writer who 50 years apart writes masterpieces ... If you look at the trajectory of the average novel writer, there is a learning period, then a period of high achievement, then the talent runs out and in middle age they start slowly to decline. People say why aren't Martin [Amis] and Julian [Barnes] getting on the Booker prize shortlist, but that's what happens in middle age. Philip Roth, though, gets better and better in middle age. In the 1990s he was almost incapable of not writing a masterpiece—''The Human Stain'', ''The Plot Against America'', ''I Married a Communist''. He was 65–70 years old, what the hell's he doing writing that well?&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.theguardian.com/books/2011/may/18/judge-quits-philip-roth-booker | location=London | work=The Guardian | first=Alison | last=Flood | title=Judge withdraws over Philip Roth's Booker win | date=May 18, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt; In 2012 he received the [[Prince of Asturias Award]] for literature.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eitb.com/en/news/entertainment/detail/900803/prince-asturias--philip-roth-wins-asturias-prize-literature/|title=US author Philip Roth wins Prince of Asturias prize for literature|first=|last=EiTB|publisher=|access-date=June 6, 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120803201451/http://www.eitb.com/en/news/entertainment/detail/900803/prince-asturias--philip-roth-wins-asturias-prize-literature/#|archive-date=August 3, 2012|dead-url=yes|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; On March 19, 2013, Roth's 80th birthday was celebrated in public ceremonies at the Newark Museum.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tabletmag.com/scroll/127998/four-score-and-philip-roth.|title=Four Score and Philip Roth|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''problem play''' is a form of drama that emerged during the 19th century as part of the wider movement of [[Realism (arts)|realism]] in the arts, especially following the innovations of [[Henrik Ibsen]]. It deals with contentious social issues through debates between the characters on stage, who typically represent conflicting points of view within a realistic social context.&lt;ref name="Problem plays"&gt;[http://www.theatrelinks.com/problem-play/ Problem Play - ''Theatre Links'']&lt;/ref&gt; Critic [[Chris Baldick]] writes that the genre emerged "from the ferment of the 1890s... for the most part inspired by the example of Ibsen's realistic stage representations of serious familial and social conflicts." He summarises it as follows:

{{quote|Rejecting the frivolity of intricately plotted romantic intrigues in the nineteenth-century French tradition of the '[[well-made play]]', it favoured instead the form of the 'problem play', which would bring to life some contemporary controversy of public importance—women's rights, unemployment, penal reform, class privilege—in a vivid but responsibly accurate presentation.&lt;ref name = "cris"&gt;Chris Baldick, ''The Modern Movement: 1910-1940'', Oxford University Press, Oxford,  2004, p.116; 367&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The critic [[F. S. Boas]] adapted the term to characterise [[Shakespeare's problem plays|certain plays]] by [[William Shakespeare]] that he considered to have characteristics similar to Ibsen's 19th-century problem plays. As a result, the term is also used more broadly and retrospectively to describe any [[Tragicomedy|tragicomic]] dramas that do not fit easily into the classical [[Genre|generic]] distinction between [[comedy]] and [[tragedy]].&lt;ref name="Problem plays" /&gt;

==Early "problem plays"==
While plays in ancient Greece and ancient Rome, mystery plays, and Elizabethan plays are clearly classified as tragedy, comedy, and [[satyr play]]s, there are some plays that exhibit the characteristics of problem plays, such as [[Alcestis (play)|Alcestis]].

==Shakespeare==
{{main|Shakespearean problem play}} 
[[F. S. Boas]] used the term to refer to a group of Shakespeare's play, which seem to contain both comic and tragic elements. For Boas the 'problem' plays were ''[[Measure for Measure]]'', ''[[All's Well That Ends Well]]'' and ''[[Troilus and Cressida]]''. He wrote that "throughout these plays we move along dim untrodden paths, and at the close our feeling is neither of simple joy nor pain; we are excited, fascinated, perplexed, for the issues raised preclude a completely satisfactory outcome".&lt;ref&gt;F. S. Boas, ''Shakespeare and his Predecessors'', John Murray, Third Impression, 1910, pp. 344–408.&lt;/ref&gt; Later critics have used the term for other plays, including ''[[Timon of Athens]]'' and ''[[The Merchant of Venice]]''.

==19th-century drama==
[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 183-1983-1118-005, Berlin, "Gespenster".jpg|thumb|left|A performance of Ibsen's ''[[Ghosts (play)|Ghosts]]'', one of the defining Problem plays,  in Berlin, 1983.]]
While social debates in drama were nothing new, the problem play of the 19th century was distinguished by its intent to confront the spectator with the dilemmas experienced by the characters. The earliest forms of the problem play are to be found in the work of French writers such as [[Alexandre Dumas, fils]], who dealt with the subject of [[prostitution]] in ''[[The Lady of the Camellias]]'' (1852). Other French playwrights followed suit with dramas about a range of social issues, sometimes approaching the subject in a moralistic, sometimes in a sentimental manner. Critic Thomas H. Dickinson, writing in 1927, argued that these early problem plays were hampered by the dramatic conventions of the day, "No play written in the problem form was significant beyond the value of the idea that was its underlying motive for existence. No problem play had achieved absolute beauty, or a living contribution to truth."&lt;ref&gt;Thomas H. Dickinson, ''An Outline of Contemporary Drama'', Houghton Mifflin, Boston, 1927, p.48&lt;/ref&gt;

The most important exponent of the problem play, however, was the [[Norway|Norwegian]] writer [[Henrik Ibsen]], whose work combined penetrating characterisation with emphasis on topical social issues, usually concentrated on the moral dilemmas of a central character. In a series of plays Ibsen addressed a range of problems, most notably the restriction of women's lives in ''[[A Doll's House]]'' (1879), sexually-transmitted disease in ''[[Ghosts (play)|Ghosts]]'' (1882) and provincial greed in ''[[An Enemy of the People]]'' (1882). Ibsen's dramas proved immensely influential, spawning variants of the problem play in works by [[George Bernard Shaw]] and other later dramatists.

==20th century==
The genre was especially influential in the early 20th century. In Britain plays such as Houghton's ''[[Hindle Wakes (play)|Hindle Wakes]]'' (1912), developed the genre to shift the nature of the 'problem'. This "resolutely realistic problem play set in domestic interiors of the mill town Hindle" starts with the 'problem' of an apparently seduced woman, but ends with the woman herself rejected her status as a victim of seduction "the 'problem' is not, after all, the redemption of a betrayed maiden's tarnished honour, but the readiness of her respectable elders to determine a young woman's future for her without regard to her rights—including here her right to erotic holiday enjoyment."&lt;ref name = "cris"/&gt;

In America the problem play was associated with the emergence of debates over civil rights issues. Racial issues were tackled in plays such as [[Angelina Weld Grimké]]'s, ''Rachel''.&lt;ref&gt;Robert J. Fehrenbach, "An Early Twentieth-Century Problem Play of Life in Black America: Angelina Grimké's ''Rachel''," in ''Wild Women in the Whirlwind: Afra-American Culture and the Contemporary Literary Renaissance'', ed. Joanne M. Braxton and Andree Nicola McLaughlin ( New Brunswick: Rutgers UP, 1990), pp. 89-106.&lt;/ref&gt; It was a tool of the socialist theatre in the 1920s and 30s, and overlapped with forms of documentary theatre in works such as Carl Crede's ''Paragraph 218'' (1930), which concerns the issue of abortion, and which was directed by [[Erwin Piscator]].&lt;ref&gt;Gary Fisher Dawson, ''Documentary Theatre in the United States: An Historical Survey and Analysis of Its Content, Form, and Stagecraft'', Greenwood Press, Westport, CT., 1999, p.126.&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Rule in Dumpor's Case''' is a [[common law]] rule of [[property law]] first set forth by Sir [[Edward Coke]] in 1578 ([[Case citation|4 Coke 1196]] [1578]).  In its most basic form, it states that once a [[landlord]] has consented to an [[Assignment (law)|assignment]] of a [[leasehold estate|tenant]]'s interest in a [[leasehold estate]], he implicitly consents to all future assignments by the tenant.

This rule is still operative in some [[U.S. states]] and some other jurisdictions which follow English common law, but the parties may [[contract]] around the rule by putting a clause in the [[Rental agreement|lease agreement]] which allows the landlord to reserve his right to approve or disapprove an assignment.

The '''Salme ships''' are two [[Clinker (boat building)|clinker-built]] ships of Scandinavian origin discovered in 2008 and 2010 near [[Salme Parish|Salme]] village on the island of [[Saaremaa]], [[Estonia]]. Both ships were used for [[ship burial]]s here around AD 700-750 in the [[Nordic Iron Age]] and contained the remains of more than 40 warriors killed in [[battle]], as well as numerous [[weapon]]s and other [[Artifact (archaeology)|artifacts]].&lt;ref name="Mägi 2018"&gt;{{cite book

== Discovery and excavation ==
[[File:Muinaslaev.Picture 048.jpg|thumb|right|The site of one of the excavated Salme ships.]]
The first ship was discovered in 2008 during earth removal for infrastructure construction. An [[Excavation (archaeology)|archaeological expedition]] has been working on site since 2008. The second ship was discovered in 2010. It is possible that at least one more ship is yet to be discovered during future excavations.

=== Location ===
The ships were located near the ancient [[coastline]], about {{convert|1.5|m|ft|0}} above water level. The location is {{convert|230|m|yd}} from the present coastline and {{convert|4|m|ft}} above present water level.&lt;ref&gt;[http://salmepaat.blogspot.com/search/label/0%20The%20Salme%20shipfind The Salme shipfind blog]&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Description ===
Both Salme ships are [[Clinker (boat building)|clinker-built]] and archaeologists have estimated their time of construction to be AD 650-700 in [[Scandinavia]]. There are signs indicating they had been repaired and patched for decades, before making their final voyage. One of the ships is {{convert|11.5|m|ft}} long and {{convert|2|m|ft|0}} wide, the second one more than {{convert|17|m|ft}} long and {{convert|3|m|ft|0}} wide. None of them had mast or sails, and they would have been rowed for short distances along the Baltic coast, or between islands,&lt;ref&gt;Archaeology: ''The First Vikings''&lt;/ref&gt; or straight across the Baltic, as rowing longer distances has proved perfectly feasible time and again in modern times. This is also indicated by the Old Norse word for distance across water "vikusjö, vikja" the distance to row before changing rowers, a distance of about {{convert|4.2|nmi}}.

=== Human remains ===
[[skeleton|Skeletal remains]] from at least 42 individuals were discovered in the two ships.&lt;ref&gt;Marek Strandberg.

There were at least 36 individuals buried in four layers in the large ship.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.postimees.ee/600144/arheoloogia-aasta-parimad-palad/ Arheoloogia-aasta parimad palad.] ''[[Postimees]]'', 17 Oct 2011. {{et icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Grave goods ===
[[File:Salme mõõk.JPG|thumb|upright|A sword from the 8th century ship burial in Salme on the island of Saaremaa.]]
Fragments of more than 40 [[sword]]s of various types, remains of [[shield]]s, [[spear]]heads and dozens of [[arrowhead]]s were found in the burial. Most of them had been deliberately deformed, perhaps to discourage [[grave robbery]].

Smaller objects included one small [[axe|socketed axe]], [[knife|knives]], [[Sharpening stone|whetstones]], a [[comb|bone comb]] with ornaments, a bear-claw [[necklace]], and hundreds of gaming pieces made of whale bone and antler with six [[dice]].

The skeletal remains of two ritually [[sacrifice]]d [[dog]]s as well as [[hawk]]s used for [[falconry]] were found in the burial.

== Interpretations ==
According to an early interpretation offered by Jüri Peets, the lead archaeologist at the site, the ships and the dead are of [[Scandinavia]]n origin. According to the most likely scenario, a war party of [[Scandinavia]]ns attempted to carry out a raid against the [[Oeselians]] ([[Estonians|Estonian]] inhabitants of the island of Saaremaa), but were attacked by Oeselian ships. The sides of the two ships contain numerous embedded arrowheads, some of which are of the three-pointed type used to carry burning materials to set enemy ships aflame. After losing too many [[oarsman|oarsmen]] to the Estonian [[archery|archers]], the raiders pulled their ships aground and tried to defend themselves behind them. It appears that after the battle, the Oeselians allowed either the survivors or some other group of Scandinavians to ritually bury their dead. The burial is unusual because the ships were not covered with earth mounds. The site was eventually forgotten by the local inhabitants after it had become overblown by sand and covered with vegetation.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ekspress.ee/news/paevauudised/ajalugu/skandinaavlased-said-saaremaal-suures-lahingus-tappa.d?id=32908835 Scandinavians were defeated in a battle in Saaremaa] {{et icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; The raid-hypothesis has led to a questioning of when the [[Viking Age]] began exactly. The Salme event took place 50-100 years earlier than the infamous [[Lindisfarne#Vikings|Lindisfarne]] Viking raid in England in the summer of AD 793.&lt;ref&gt;Archaeology: ''The First Vikings''&lt;/ref&gt;

The original interpretation was called into question after the second, larger, ship was uncovered in 2010. It is likely that the human remains in it belonged to individuals of noble birth, as evidenced by the large number of expensive bronze sword-hilts and the complete lack of weaponry associated with commoners. The presence of dogs and hawks used for falconry indicates that the original purpose of the trip to Estonia may have been [[leisure]] or [[diplomacy]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.postimees.ee/600144/arheoloogia-aasta-parimad-palad/ Arheoloogia-aasta parimad palad.] ''[[Postimees]]'', 17 Oct 2011. {{et icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; Peets suggests that the men may have come on a voyage from Sweden to forge an alliance or establish kinship ties when unknown parties set upon them.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/2016/07/27/ancient-ships-death-were-they-mission-politics-plunder/87586278/ ''Ancient ships of death: Were they on a mission of politics or plunder?''] USA Today. 27 July 2016. Retrieved 27 July 2016.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Legendary background ===
[[Snorri Sturluson]] relates in his ''[[Ynglinga saga]]'' that the [[Swedish king]] [[Ingvar]], [[Östen]]'s son, was a great warrior who often spent time patrolling the shores of his kingdom fighting [[Danes]] and Vikings from Estonia (''Víkingr frá Esthland''). King Ingvar finally came to a peace agreement with the Danes and could take care of the Vikings in Estonia. He consequently started pillaging in [[Ancient Estonia|Estonia]] in retribution, and one summer he arrived at a place called Stein (see also [[Sveigder]]). The Vikings in Estonia (''sýslu kind'') assembled a great army in the interior and attacked King Ingvar in a great battle. Their forces were too powerful and Ingvar fell and the Swedish forces retreated. Ingvar was buried in a mound at a place called ''Stone'' or ''[[Hill fort]]'' (''at Steini'') on the shores of ''Aðalsýsla'', that is what is now mainland Estonia.

'''San Gervasio''' is an [[archaeological site]] of the [[pre-Columbian]] [[Maya civilization]], located in the northern third of the island of [[Cozumel]] off the northeastern coast of the [[Yucatán Peninsula]], in what is now the Mexican state of [[Quintana Roo]].  San Gervasio's pre-Hispanic name was Tantun Cuzamil, Mayan for ''Flat Rock in the place of the Swallows.'' The ruins were once a hub of worship of the goddess [[Ix Chel]], an aged deity of childbirth, fertility, medicine, and weaving. Pre-Columbian Maya women would try to travel to San Gervasio and make offerings at least once in their lives. In 1560, the Spanish historian, Diego Lopez de Cogolludo, wrote: "The pilgrims arrive at Cozumel for the fulfillment of their vows to offer their sacrifices, to ask help for their needs, and for the mistaken adoration of their false gods."  The bishop of Yucatán, Diego de Landa, wrote in 1549 that the Maya "held Cozumel in the same veneration as we have for pilgrimages to Jerusalem and Rome, and so they used to go to visit and offer presents there, as we do to holy places; and if they did not go themselves, they always sent their offerings."&lt;ref&gt;FPMCQROO brochure that accompanies the purchase of each ticket to the park.  This brochure also refers readers to the website [http://www.EverthingCozumel.com EverythingCozumel.com]{{dead link|date=March 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }} for further information.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Overview==

[[File:Altar, San Gervasio.JPG|300px|thumbnail|right|"The Altar" on the central plaza. In the background, one can see Las Columnas ("the Columns") on the left, and Los Nichos ("the Niches") on the right. In the front right, an iguana is facing the structure.]]

Although most of the stone structures at San Gervasio now lack their roofs and upper portions of their walls, archaeologists from Harvard and the University of Arizona compiled detailed plans of the remains in the early 1970s that allowed them to create reconstructed views of these buildings.  Renderings of these reconstructions are illustrated in the guidebook offered for sale by the Cozumel Parks and Museum Foundation (FPMCQROO), an agency of the Mexican State of Quintana Roo and the agency responsible for the upkeep and maintenance of the State park that surrounds the National Monument of the ruins of San Gervasio, which is administered separately by the National Institute of Anthropology and History (INAH).  More information about the archaeological park, including hours of operation, entrance fees, and directions are available on the FPMCQROO website CozumelParks.com

The park is a wildlife refuge and the local iguana population has become quite habituated to humans.  Although other species of lizards abound, they are not so trusting.  Likewise, the peccaries and coatis that are sometimes spotted as they pass through the ruins tend to keep a safe distance from the tourists.

The ruins cover 4 districts spread out over several square kilometers, but only certain parts of District 1 are open to the public.   Most of the District 1 buildings that are accessible lie within or very near the District 1 Central Plaza Group.&lt;ref&gt;Hajovsky, R (2012). ''The Yellow Guide to the Mayan Ruins of San Gervasio, Cozumel,'' Amazon books&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The first European to visit San Gervasio was Juan de Grijalva, who discovered the island for the Spanish in 1518.  The second group of European visitors came with the Hernan Cortes expedition, which stopped by the island on the way to Veracruz in 1519.  Both groups were received well by the Maya of Cozumel, and Cortez even wrote a letter for them to present to any Spaniards that came to the island in the future, stating that “there is no gold here and these are peaceful people.”  The letter did not help much, however, when the Panfilo de Narvaez expedition arrived in 1520.  Several of the expedition’s crewmembers were sick with smallpox. The sickness ran rampant across the island.  There have been three mass graves discovered at San Gervasio where these smallpox victims were buried, along with their glass trade-beads given to them by the Spanish.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.EverythingCozumel.com/Cozumel-History.html www.EverythingCozumel.com/TheTrueHistoryofCozumel]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:mayaHands.jpg|right|thumb|300px|Las Manitas (the hand prints are visible in the back, right of the right column)]]

==Structures==

===Las Manitas===
Meaning: Little Hands

[[File:Hand prints at Las Manitas, San Gervasio.JPG|thumbnail|left|Hand prints at Las Manitas (in detail)]]

Constructed during: Terminal-Classic (1000-1200 AD)

Location: East of the District 1 Central Plaza

Las Manitas was the residence of the ''halach unik,'' or the Mayan ruler of Cozumel during the Terminal Classic Period.  It has an outer room that was his residence and an inner sanctum that was his personal shrine.  The name of the building comes from red-colored hand prints on the interior walls.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.EverythingCozumel.com/Cozumel-History.html www.EverythingCozumel.com/TheTrueHistoryofCozumel]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Chi Chan Nah===
Meaning: Small House

Constructed during: Post Classic

Location: to the East of Las Manitas

This building was an oratorio, or chapel, used by the family of the halach uinik who lived in the nearby residence of Las Manitas (see above).  It consisted of a large outer room with a small inner sanctum containing an altar.  In the nearby altar platform (named La Tumba) to the west of Las Manitas, a single vaulted-roofed tomb was discovered in 1973, the only one of its kind found in San Gervasio.&lt;ref&gt;Sabloff, J and Rathje, W (1975). ‘’Changing Pre-Columbian Commercial Systems, the 1972-73 seasons at Cozumel,’’ monograph of the Peabody Museum, Harvard University&lt;/ref&gt;

===Ka'na Nah===
Meaning: Tall House

Constructed during: Post-Classic (1200-1650 AD)

Location: West of the District 1 Central Plaza

This pyramid is the largest single structure in San Gervasio. Due to certain architectural arrangements in the interior of the small room on the top, this structure may have been the temple of Ixchel described in 1552 by Francisco Lopez de Gomara, when he wrote of a temple "where they kept a very strange idol, very distinct from the others.  The body of this great idol was hollow, made of baked clay and fastened to the wall with mortar, in back of which was something like a sacristy, where the priests had a small secret door cut into the side of the idol, into which one of them would enter, and from it speak to and answer those who came to worship and beg favors.  With this trickery, simple men were made to believe whatever the god told them." &lt;ref&gt;Lopez de Gomara, F (1552) Historia General de las Indias&lt;/ref&gt;   In 1618, Diego Lopez de Cogolludo wrote that "they venerated the statue more than the others, sacrificing to it birds, dogs, their own blood, and even men."&lt;ref&gt;Lopez de Cogolludo, D (1688). ''Historia de Yucatan''&lt;/ref&gt;

===El Arco===
[[Image:mayaArch.jpg|right|thumb|300px|The arch at San Gervasio]]
Meaning: The Arch

Constructed during: A reconstruction erected in the 1980s

Location: Northeast of District 1 Central Plaza

This arch is the main entrance from the north and west to San Gervasio’s District 1 Central Plaza Group. It is a simple arch about seven feet tall that straddles the main religious pathway (called a ''sacbe'' in Mayan, a word meaning "white road") running northeast from the plaza. It was reconstructed by INAH in the form of similar arches found at other sites on the east coast of Quintana Roo, such as El Cedral, located on the southern portion of Cozumel.&lt;ref&gt;Hajovsky, R (2012). ''The Yellow Guide to the Mayan Ruins of San Gervasio, Cozumel,'' Amazon books&lt;/ref&gt;

To the north of this arch, on the western edge of the religious pathway lies a small hole in the bedrock, similar to others that can be found throughout the ruins. These natural karst formations are called cenotes (from the Mayan word ‘’d'zonot’’) and served as water sources for the inhabitants of San Gervasio.

===District 1 Central Plaza===
Meaning:

Constructed during: Post-Classic (1200-1650 AD)

Location: Northwest of the entrance to the ruins

The Plaza Group consists of 6 buildings arranged in a square around a central altar platform. Several of these buildings once had roofs made of timber and thatch, which have since rotted away.  Others had roofs of wood beams and poured mortar, while a few had rooms constructed of corbeled arches.  All were public buildings and included temples, oratories, altars, and a building used to house visitors who came to participate in religious events taking place in the plaza.&lt;ref&gt;Hajovsky, R (2012). ''The Yellow Guide to the Mayan Ruins of San Gervasio, Cozumel,'' Amazon books&lt;/ref&gt;

===Nohoch Nah===
Meaning: Big House

Constructed during: Terminal-Classic (1000-1200 AD) and Post-Classic (1200-1650 AD)

Location: North of the District 1 Central Plaza

With its intact roof, this is one of the best preserved buildings in San Gervasio.  Inside, (closed off to the public, but visible through the doorway) the interior walls still show signs of a red, ochre and blue mural.  This building was a temple dedicated to Ku’kul’kan, the feathered serpent god.&lt;ref&gt;Hajovsky, R (2012). ‘’The Yellow Guide to the Mayan Ruins of San Gervasio, Cozumel,’’ Amazon books&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Los Murcielagos, San Gervasio.JPG|300px|thumbnail|right|Los Murcielagos]]

===Los Murcielagos===
Meaning: The Bats

Constructed during: Late-Classic (600-1000 AD)

Location: Northwest of District 1 Central Plaza

This compound is made up of several rooms and out-buildings situated on a platform and making up the residence of the halach uinik of Cozumel during the late Post-Classic Period.&lt;ref&gt;Hajovsky, R (2012).

"Scientology center heads downtown", ''Kansas City Star''&lt;/ref&gt; but, according to a 2001 survey published by the [[City University of New York]], 55,000 people in the United States would, if asked to identify their religion, have stated Scientology.&lt;ref&gt;Kosmin, Barry A. et al.

[[Tom Cruise]] is the most well known Scientologist in the US as well as other countries. The Church of Scientology has an emphasis on [[Scientology and celebrities|recruiting celebrities]] as L. Ron Hubbard himself wished, and offices designed for this use are called "[[Celebrity Centres]]".

==Legal status==

}}&lt;/ref&gt; As part of the effort to regain [[tax exemption]] during the late 1970s, Scientologists repeatedly infiltrated the IRS, copying large numbers of documents and at one point placing an electronic bugging device in an IRS conference room.&lt;ref name=DHDavis /&gt; These actions took place within a program code-named "Operation Snow White" (see below).&lt;ref name=DHDavis /&gt; Eleven high-ranking Scientologists, including Hubbard's wife [[Mary Sue Hubbard]], were sentenced to time in prison for acts surrounding this operation.&lt;ref name=DHDavis /&gt; Hubbard himself was named as an unindicted co-conspirator as investigators could not link him to the crimes.&lt;ref name=DHDavis /&gt;

The Church then embarked on an aggressive, but more legal course, the church's hundreds of affiliated entities filing a steady stream of lawsuits against the IRS in an attempt to have their tax-exempt status approved.&lt;ref name=DHDavis /&gt; In addition, members of the Church started filing thousands of lawsuits against the IRS, claiming that they were entitled to tax deductions for auditing and training expenses.&lt;ref name=DHDavis /&gt;

They were finally rewarded in October 1993, when the IRS formally announced that the Church of Scientology and its related social betterment organizations had been granted tax exemption again.&lt;ref name=DHDavis /&gt; Since then, the U.S. Department of State has formally criticized several European countries, including Germany and France, for religious discrimination against Scientologists.&lt;ref name=BBCFRance&gt;

==Controversies==
{{Main|Scientology controversies}}
*On January 4, 1963, more than one hundred [[E-meter]]s were seized by [[United States Marshals Service|US marshals]] at the "Founding Church of Scientology" building, now known as the [[L. Ron Hubbard House]], located in [[Washington, D.C.]] The church was accused of making false claims that the devices effectively treated some 70 percent of all physical and mental illness. The FDA also charged that the devices did not bear adequate directions for treating the conditions for which they were recommended.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Christopher Riche Evans |title=[[Cults of Unreason]] |publisher=Farrar, Straus and Giroux |year=1974 |isbn=0-374-13324-7}} Chapter 6.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Russell Miller |title=Bare-Faced Messiah: The true story of L.

*The FBI raid on the Church's headquarters revealed documentation that detailed Scientology actions against various critics of the organization. Among these documents was a plan to frame [[Gabe Cazares]], the mayor of the city of [[Clearwater, Florida|Clearwater]], [[Florida]], with a staged hit-and-run accident; plans to discredit the skeptical organization [[CSICOP]] by spreading rumors that it was a front for the [[CIA]]; and a project called "[[Operation Freakout]]," aimed at ruining the life of author [[Paulette Cooper]], author of an early book critical of the movement, ''The Scandal of Scientology.''&lt;ref name="sppulitzer"&gt;{{cite news |author=Charles L.

*The Church of Scientology long considered the [[Cult Awareness Network]] (CAN) as one of its most important enemies, and many Scientology publications during the 1980s and 1990s cast CAN (and its spokesperson at the time, Cynthia Kisser) in an unfriendly light, accusing the cult-watchdog organization of various criminal activities.

===''Washington Post'' lawsuit===
In a 1995 lawsuit against the ''[[Washington Post]]'' newspaper [[list of Latin phrases (E)#E|''et al.'']]. The [[Religious Technology Center]] (RTC), the corporation that controls [[L. Ron Hubbard]]'s copyrighted materials, sued to prevent a ''Post'' reporter from describing church teachings at the center of another lawsuit, claiming copyright infringement, trade secret misappropriation, and that the circulation of their "advanced technology" teachings would cause "devastating, cataclysmic spiritual harm" to those not prepared.

===Operation Snow White===
{{Main|Operation Snow White}}
Operation Snow White was the [[Church of Scientology]]'s name for a project during the 1970s to purge unfavorable records about Scientology and its founder [[L. Ron Hubbard]]. This project included a series of infiltrations and thefts from 136 government agencies, foreign embassies and consulates, and private organizations critical of Scientology, carried out by Church members, in more than 30 countries;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first= Stephen |last= Labaton |title= Scientologists Granted Tax Exemption by the U.S. |url= https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9F0CE6D81638F937A25753C1A965958260&amp;sec=&amp;spon=&amp;pagewanted=all |work= [[New York Times]] |date= 1993-10-14 |accessdate= 2008-05-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; the single largest infiltration of the United States government in history&lt;ref name="Double Crossed"&gt;{{cite news|first=Tony |last=Ortega |url=http://www.phoenixnewtimes.com/1999-12-23/news/double-crossed/ |title=Double Crossed |work=[[Phoenix New Times]] |publisher=[[New Times Media]] |date= 1999-12-23|accessdate=2006-06-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; with up to 5,000 covert agents.&lt;ref name="Vanished"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.time.com/time/printout/0,8816,951938,00.html |title= Mystery of the Vanished Ruler |accessdate= 2007-08-10 |date= 1983-01-31|work= |publisher= [[Time (magazine)|Time]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; This was also the operation that exposed '[[Operation Freakout]]', because this was the case that brought the government into investigation on the Church.&lt;ref name="Vanished" /&gt;

Under this program, [[Scientology]] operatives committed [[espionage|infiltration]], [[wiretapping]], and theft of documents in government offices, most notably those of the [[U.S. Internal Revenue Service]]. Eleven highly placed Church executives, including [[Mary Sue Hubbard]] (wife of founder [[L. Ron Hubbard]] and second-in-command of the organisation), pleaded guilty or were convicted in federal court of obstructing justice, burglary of government offices, and theft of documents and government property. The case was ''United States vs. Mary Sue Hubbard et al.'', 493 F.

===Lisa McPherson and the "Introspection Rundown"===
{{Main|Lisa McPherson|Introspection Rundown}}
[[File:Lisa raw scan.jpg|thumb|right|150px|Lisa McPherson]]
The most widely publicized death of one of the organization's members involved the 1995 death of 36-year-old [[Lisa McPherson]], while in the care of Scientologists at the Scientology-owned Fort Harrison Hotel, in [[Clearwater, Florida|Clearwater]], [[Florida]]. Despite McPherson's having experienced symptoms usually associated with [[mental illness]] (such as removing all of her clothes at the scene of a minor traffic accident), the Church intervened to prevent McPherson from receiving psychiatric treatment, and to return her to the custody of the Church of Scientology. Records show that she was then placed in isolation as part of a Scientology program known as the [[Introspection Rundown]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first= Thomas C. |last= Tobin |title= Scientologists decry toll of criminal case |url= http://www.sptimes.com/News/030900/TampaBay/Scientologists_decry_.shtml |publisher= [[St. Petersburg Times]] |date= 2000-03-09 |accessdate= 2007-09-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; Weeks later, she was pronounced dead on arrival at a hospital. Her body was covered in cockroach bites. A later [[autopsy]] showed that she had died of a [[pulmonary embolism]].

===Noah Lottick===
Noah Lottick was an American student of [[Russian studies]] who committed suicide on May 11, 1990 by jumping from a 10th-floor hotel window, clutching his only remaining money in his hands.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,972865,00.html Scientology: The Thriving Cult of Greed and Power], ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'', May 6, 1991, see article: [[The Thriving Cult of Greed and Power]]&lt;/ref&gt; After his death, a controversy arose revolving around his parents' concern over his membership in the [[Church of Scientology]].

== History ==

=== 2013 ===
SPC announced its formation on April 15, 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.seattleprivacy.org/spc-organizational-development-underway | title=SPC organizational development underway | date=April 15, 2013 | accessdate=July 31, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The founding members,&lt;ref name="about" /&gt; as listed on the organization's website, included:

* [[Jacob Appelbaum]]
* Jan Bultmann
* Lee Colleton
* Phil Mocek
* David Robinson
* Allegra Searle-LeBel

In August 2013, members of SPC were interviewed on [[KEXP-FM|KEXP FM]]'s "Mind Over Matters: Community Forum" to discuss the formation of SPC and the [[City of Seattle]]'s surveillance cameras that are owned and operated by the [[Seattle Police Department]] but funded by the [[Department of Homeland Security]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=McCormick|first1=Mike|title=Mind Over Matters: Community Forum 080313cf.mp3|url=http://hotpotatomedia.com/mpgs/080313cf.mp3|website=kexp.org|publisher=[[KEXP-FM|KEXP FM]]|date=3 August 2013|accessdate=15 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In November 2013, a member of SPC was interviewed by [[The Stranger (newspaper)]] about privacy policy and government oversight in Seattle following increased public awareness about the [[Seattle Police Department]]'s wireless mesh network in the downtown corridor.&lt;ref name="ts1"/&gt;

=== 2014 ===
In March 2014, members of SPC testified in a [[Seattle City Light]] review panel meeting about [[smart meter]] privacy risks and security vulnerabilities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=City Light Review Panel Meeting Meeting Minutes|url=http://www.seattle.gov/Documents/Departments/CityLightReviewPanel/Minutes/03.19.14%20Meeting%20Notes.pdf|website=seattle.gov|publisher=Seattle City Light|date=9 March 2014|accessdate=15 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Also in March, a member of SPC testified to the [[Washington State Legislature|Washington State House]] Committee on Public Safety concerning technology-enhanced government surveillance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=SENATE BILL REPORT  ESHB 1639|url=http://app.leg.wa.gov/documents/billdocs/2015-16/Htm/Bill%20Reports/Senate/1639-S.E%20SBA%20LAW%2015.htm|website=leg.wa.gov|publisher=Washington State Legislature|accessdate=15 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In July 2014, a member of SPC informed the Seattle Police Department about another active node in the SPD's mesh network,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Whitcomb|first1=Sean|title=Oh Node You Didn't!|url=http://spdblotter.seattle.gov/2014/07/11/oh-node-you-didnt/|website=seattle.gov|publisher=Seattle Police Department|date=11 July 2014|accessdate=15 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; something SPD promised the City of Seattle would not happen in November 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Kiley|first1=Brendan|last2=Fikse-Verkerk|first2=Matt|title=The Seattle Police Department Disables Its Mesh Network (the New Apparatus Capable of Spying on You)|url=http://slog.thestranger.com/slog/archives/2013/11/12/the-seattle-police-department-disables-its-mesh-network-the-new-apparatus-capable-of-spying-on-you|website=thestranger.com|publisher=[[The Stranger (newspaper)|The Stranger]]|date=12 November 2013|accessdate=15 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In August 2014, the Community Technology Advisory Board responded to SPC's proposal to the City Council for a Chief Privacy Officer and staff for a Privacy Board. CTAB did not endorse the budget or proposal and instead decided to support a formal privacy review process.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Privacy {{sic|Comm|itee|hide=y}} now posted|url=http://ctab.seattle.gov/2014/08/04/privacy-{{Not a typo|commi|tee}}-now-posted/|website=seattle.gov|publisher=Seattle Community Technology Advisory Board|date=4 August 2014|accessdate=15 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In September 2014, members of SPC were interviewed on [[KEXP-FM|KEXP FM]]'s "Mind Over Matters: Community Forum" to discuss how federal grants end up affecting municipal privacy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=McCormick|first1=Mike|title=Mind Over Matters: Community Forum 091314cf.mp3|url=http://hotpotatomedia.com/mpgs/091314cf.mp3|website=kexp.org|publisher=[[KEXP-FM|KEXP FM]]|date=13 September 2014|accessdate=15 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== 2015 ===
In April 2015, a member of SPC spoke in a televised Seattle Channel discussion titled "Privacy Politics" which looked at the balance between open government and data privacy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Valley|first1=Jim|title="Privacy Politics" on Seattle Speaks|url=http://techtalk.seattle.gov/2015/04/22/privacy-politics-on-seattle-speaks/|website=seattle.gov|publisher=Seattle Department of Information Technology|date=22 April 2015|accessdate=15 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In August 2015, a member of SPC discovered new surveillance cameras in Seattle and was later interviewed by several local news organizations including [[KING-TV|King 5 News]] and [[KIRO-TV|Kiro 7 News]] about the lack of transparency when setting up these cameras and concerns for privacy invasion. SPC further discovered that the [[Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives]] had deployed the surveillance cameras.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Hahn|first1=Elisa|title=Mixed reaction to ATF surveillance cameras in Central District|url=http://www.king5.com/story/news/local/seattle/2015/08/07/atf-surveillance-cameras-central-district/31320713/|work=[[KING-TV|King 5 News]]|publisher=[[King Broadcasting Company]]|date=August 7, 2015|accessdate=15 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Johnson|first1=Graham|title=ATF confirms it installed two video cameras in Seattle's Central District|url=http://www.kirotv.com/news/news/atf-confirms-it-installed-two-surveillance-cameras/nnFGh/|work=[[KIRO-TV|Kiro 7 News]]|publisher=[[Cox Media Group]]|date=August 6, 2014|accessdate=15 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In September 2015, a member of SPC was interviewed by [[Crosscut.com]] in an article about a new wireless tracking network deployed by the Seattle Department of Transportation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Kroman|first1=David|title=Seattle installs new system to track individual drivers|url=http://crosscut.com/2015/09/seattles-new-technology-tracks-how-we-drive/|website=crosscut.com|publisher=[[Crosscut.com]]|accessdate=15 November 2015|date=8 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; A member of SPC brought attention to the issue at the Community Technology Advisory Board.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=September 8, 2015 Seattle Technology Advisory Board Minutes|url=http://ctab.seattle.gov/2015/10/12/september-8-2015-seattle-technology-advisory-board-minutes/|website=ctab.seattle.gov|publisher=Seattle Community Technology Advisory Board|accessdate=15 November 2015|date=12 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''standard language''' or '''standard variety''' is either as a language [[variety (linguistics)|variety]] used by a population for public purposes, or a variety that has undergone standardization.{{sfn|Finegan|2007|p=14}}
Typically, varieties that become standardized are the local [[dialect]]s spoken in the centers of [[commerce]] and [[government]], where a need arises for a variety that will serve more than local needs.
Standardization typically involves a fixed orthography, codification in authoritative grammars and dictionaries and public acceptance of these standards.
A standard [[written language]] is sometimes termed by the [[German language|German]] word ''Schriftsprache''.

A [[pluricentric language]] has multiple interacting standard varieties.{{sfn|Stewart|1968|p=534}}{{sfn|Kloss|1967|p=31}}{{sfn|Clyne|1992|p=1}}
Examples include [[English language|English]], [[French language|French]],  [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]], [[German language|German]], [[Korean language|Korean]], [[Serbo-Croatian]], [[Spanish language|Spanish]], [[Swedish language|Swedish]], [[Armenian language|Armenian]] and [[Chinese language|Chinese]].{{sfn|Clyne|1992|pp=1–3}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Kordić |first=Snježana |authorlink=Snježana Kordić |editor1-last=Madelain |editor1-first=Anne |title=Au sud de l'Est |series=vol. 3 |publisher=Non Lieu |pages=71–78 |language=French |chapter=La langue croate, serbe, bosniaque et monténégrine |trans-chapter=Croatian, Serbian, Bosniakian, and Montenegrin |chapterurl=http://bib.irb.hr/datoteka/429734.LA_LANGUE_CROATE_SERBE.PDF |deadurl=no |location=Paris |year=2007 |isbn=978-2-35270-036-4 |oclc=182916790 |archivedate=4 August 2012 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/69f5WqGAx?url=http://bib.irb.hr/datoteka/429734.LA_LANGUE_CROATE_SERBE.PDF |accessdate=8 May 2014 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;
Monocentric languages, such as [[Russian language|Russian]] and [[Japanese language|Japanese]], have only one standardized version.{{sfn|Clyne|1992|p=3}}

== Standardization ==

A standard variety is developed from a group of related varieties.
This may be done by elevating a single variety, such as the local variety of a center of government or culture.
Alternatively, a new variety may be defined as a selection of features from existing varieties.{{sfn|Ammon|2004|p=275}}
A fixed orthography is typically created for writing the variety.
It may be codified in normative [[dictionaries]] and [[linguistic description|grammar]]s, or by an agreed collection of exemplary texts.{{sfn|Ammon|2004|p=275}}
Whether these dictionaries and grammars are created by private individuals (like ''[[Webster's Dictionary]]'') or by state institutions, they become standard if they are treated as authorities for correcting language.{{sfn|Ammon|2004|p=276}}
A fixed written form and subsequent codification make the standard variety more stable than purely spoken varieties, and provide a base for further development or ''[[ausbau]]''.{{sfn|Ammon|2004|p=275}}
This variety becomes the norm for writing, is used in broadcasting and for official purposes, and is the form taught to non-native learners.{{sfn|Trudgill|2006|p=119}}

Through this process, the standard variety acquires [[prestige (sociolinguistics)|prestige]] and a greater functional importance than local varieties.{{sfn|Trudgill|2006|p=119}}
Those varieties are said to be dependent on, or [[autonomy and heteronomy (sociolinguistics)|heteronomous]] with respect to, the standard variety, because speakers read and write the standard, refer to it as an authority is such matters as specialist vocabulary, and any standardizing changes in their speech are towards that standard.{{sfn|Chambers|Trudgill|1998|p=9}}
In some cases, such as [[Standard English]], this process may take place over an extended period without government intervention.
In others it may be deliberately directed by official institutions, such as the [[Académie française]] or [[Royal Spanish Academy|Real Academia Española]], and can proceed much more quickly.{{sfn|Trudgill|2006|p=119}}

Language standardization is often linked to the formation, or attempted formation, of [[nation states]], as language is seen as the vehicle of a shared culture.{{sfn|Inoue|2006|p=122}}
Different national standards derived from a [[dialect continuum]] may be regarded as different languages, even if they are [[mutually intelligible]].{{sfn|Stewart|1968}}{{sfn|Chambers|Trudgill|1998|p=11}}
The [[North Germanic language|Scandinavian languages]], [[Danish language|Danish]], [[Norwegian language|Norwegian]] and [[Swedish language|Swedish]], are often cited as examples.{{sfn|Chambers|Trudgill|1998|pp=3–4}}

In other cases governments or neighbouring populations may seek to deny a standard independent status.{{sfn|Inoue|2006|pp=123–124}}
In response, developers of a standard may base it on more divergent varieties.
Thus after [[Norway]] became independent at the start of the 20th century, the [[Bokmål]] standard based on the speech of [[Oslo]] was felt to be too similar to [[Danish language|Danish]] by [[Ivar Aasen]], who developed a rival [[Nynorsk]] standard based on western varieties.
Similarly, when a standard was developed in the [[Socialist Republic of Macedonia|Yugoslav republic of Macedonia]] from local varieties within a continuum with [[Serbia]] to the north and [[Bulgaria]] to the east, it was deliberately based on varieties from the west of the republic that were most different from standard [[Bulgarian language|Bulgarian]].
Now known as [[Macedonian language|Macedonian]], it is the national standard of the independent [[Republic of Macedonia]], but viewed by Bulgarians as a dialect of Bulgarian.{{sfn|Trudgill|1992|pp=173–174}}

==Examples==
{{see also|List of language regulators}}

===Chinese===
[[Chinese language|Chinese]] consists of hundreds of [[varieties of Chinese|local varieties]], many of which are not mutually intelligible, usually classified into seven to ten major groups, including [[Mandarin Chinese|Mandarin]], [[Wu Chinese|Wu]], [[Yue Chinese|Yue]], [[Hakka Chinese|Hakka]] and [[Min Chinese|Min]].
Before the 20th century, most Chinese spoke only their local variety.
For two millennia, formal writing had been done in [[Literary Chinese]] (or Classical Chinese), a style modelled on the [[Chinese classics|classics]] and far removed from any contemporary speech.{{sfn|Norman|1988|pp=108–109, 245}}
As a practical measure, officials of the late imperial dynasties carried out the administration of the empire using a [[Mandarin (late imperial lingua franca)|common language based on Mandarin varieties]], known as ''Guānhuà'' (literally "speech of officials").{{sfn|Norman|1988|pp=133, 136}}

In the early 20th century, many Chinese intellectuals argued that the country needed a standardized language.
By the 1920s, Literary Chinese had been replaced as the written standard by [[written vernacular Chinese]], which was based on Mandarin dialects.{{sfn|Norman|1988|pp=133–134}}
In the 1930s, [[Standard Chinese]] was adopted, with its pronunciation based on the [[Beijing dialect]], but with vocabulary also drawn from other Mandarin varieties and its syntax based on the written vernacular.{{sfn|Norman|1988|p=135}}
It is the official spoken language of the [[People's Republic of China]] (where it is called ''Pǔtōnghuà''  "common speech") and of the [[Republic of China]] governing Taiwan (as ''Guóyǔ'' "national language"), and one of the official languages of [[Singapore]] (as ''Huáyǔ'' "Chinese language").{{sfn|Norman|1988|pp=136–137}}
Standard Chinese now dominates public life, and is much more widely studied than any other variety of Chinese.{{sfn|Norman|1988|p=247}}

===Dutch===
Dutch is a [[Pluricentric language|monocentric language]], with all speakers using the same [[standardization|standard form]] (authorized by the [[Dutch Language Union]]) based on a [[Dutch orthography]] employing the [[Latin alphabet]] when writing. A process of standardisation of [[Dutch language|Dutch]] started in the [[Middle Ages]], especially under the influence of the [[Burgundian Netherlands|Burgundian]] Ducal Court in Dijon ([[Brussels]] after 1477). Till then every region spoke a different [[Middle Dutch]] dialect. The dialects of the [[County of Flanders]] and the [[Duchy of Brabant]] were the most influential around this time. The process of standardisation became much stronger at the start of the 16th century, mainly based on the urban dialect of [[Antwerp]]. In 1585 Antwerp [[Fall of Antwerp (1584–1585)|fell]] to the Spanish army: many from the [[Southern Netherlands]] fled to the [[Dutch Republic|Northern Netherlands]] (that [[Act of Abjuration|declared itself independent]] from Spain), especially to the [[County of Holland|province of Holland]], where they influenced the urban dialects. In 1637, a further important step was made towards a unified language,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.ccjk.com/dutch-full-historical-junk/ | title=Dutch &amp; Other Languages|publisher=Ccjk.com|accessdate=2015-08-12 }}&lt;/ref&gt; when the [[Statenvertaling]], the first major Bible translation into Dutch, was created that people from all over the new republic could understand. It used elements from various dialects but was predominantly based on the urban dialects of Holland of post 16th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://taal.phileon.nl/brabants.php |title=Taal in Nederland .:. Brabants |publisher=Taal.phileon.nl |accessdate=2014-06-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===English===
In [[British English]] the standard, known as [[Standard English]] (SE), is historically based on the language of the medieval English [[court of Chancery]].{{sfn|Smith|1996}} The late seventeenth and eighteenth centuries saw the establishment of this standard as the norm of "polite" society, that is to say of the [[upper class]]es.{{sfn|Blake|1996}} The spoken standard has come to be seen as a mark of good education and social prestige.{{sfn|Baugh|Cable|2002}} Although often associated with the [[Received Pronunciation|RP accent]], SE can be spoken with any accent, such as [[General American]], [[General Australian]], etc.{{sfn|Smith|1996}}

===Greek===
The standard form of [[Modern Greek]] is based on the [[Varieties of Modern Greek#Spoken dialects|Southern dialects]]; these dialects are spoken mainly in the [[Peloponnese]], the [[Ionian Islands]], [[Attica]], [[Crete]] and the [[Cyclades]].&lt;ref&gt;Horrocks, Geoffrey (1997): ''Greek: A history of the language and its speakers.'' London: Longman. Ch.17.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Hindi-Urdu===
Two standardised [[register (sociolinguistics)|registers]] of the [[Hindustani language]] have legal status India: [[Standard Hindi]] (one of 23 co-official national languages) and [[Urdu]] ([[Pakistan]]’s official tongue), resultantly, Hindustani often called “Hindi-Urdu".&lt;ref name=Blum&gt;{{cite book|last=Blum |first=Daniel|year=2002 |language=German |title=Sprache und Politik : Sprachpolitik und Sprachnationalismus in der Republik Indien und dem sozialistischen Jugoslawien (1945-1991) |trans-title=Language and Policy: Language Policy and Linguistic Nationalism in the Republic of India and the Socialist Yugoslavia (1945-1991) |series=Beiträge zur Südasienforschung ; vol. 192 |location=Würzburg | publisher=Ergon | page=200 |isbn=3-89913-253-X |oclc=51961066}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{main article|An Caighdeán Oifigiúil}}
''[[An Caighdeán Oifigiúil]]'' ("The Official Standard"), often shortened to ''An Caighdeán'', is official standard of the [[Irish language]].

===Italian===
Standard [[Italian language|Italian]] is derived from the [[Tuscan dialect]], specifically from its [[Florentine dialect|Florentine variety]] &amp;mdash; the Florentine influence upon early [[Italian literature]] established that dialect as base for the standard language of Italy. In particular, Italian became the language of culture for all the people of Italy, thanks to the prestige of the masterpieces of [[Dante Alighieri]], [[Francesco Petrarca]], [[Giovanni Boccaccio]], [[Niccolò Machiavelli]], and [[Francesco Guicciardini]]. It would later become the official language of all the [[Historical states of Italy|Italian states]], and after the [[Italian unification]] it became the [[national language]] of the [[Kingdom of Italy (1861–1946)|Kingdom of Italy]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://linguistics.byu.edu/classes/ling450ch/reports/Italian2.html A Brief History of the Italian Language by Cory Crawford]. linguistics.byu.edu&lt;/ref&gt; Modern [[Italian language|Standard Italian]]'s lexicon has been deeply influenced by almost all [[Languages of Italy|regional languages of Italy]] while its [[received pronunciation]] (known as ''Pronuncia Fiorentina Emendata'', Amended Florentine Pronunciation) is based on the [[Accent (dialect)|accent]] of [[Romanesco dialect|Romanesco]] ([[Rome|Roman dialect]]); these are the reasons why Standard Italian differs significantly from the [[Tuscan dialect]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.treccani.it/enciclopedia/pronuncia_(Enciclopedia_dell'Italiano)/ La pronuncia italiana (Italian)]. treccani.it&lt;/ref&gt;

===Latin===
[[Classical Latin]] was the literary standard dialect of Latin spoken by higher socioeconomic classes, as opposed to the [[Vulgar Latin]] which is the generic term of the colloquial [[sociolect]]s of Latin spoken across the [[Roman Empire]] by uneducated and less-educated classes. The Latin brought by Roman soldiers to [[Gaul]], [[Hispania|Iberia]], or [[Dacia]] was not identical to the Latin of [[Cicero]], and differed from it in vocabulary, syntax, and grammar.&lt;ref name="Palmer"&gt;L. R. Palmer The Latin Language (repr. Univ. Oklahoma 1988, {{ISBN|0-8061-2136-X}})&lt;/ref&gt;

===Portuguese===

In Brazil, actors and journalists usually adopt an unofficial, but de facto, spoken standard [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]], originally derived from the middle-class dialect of [[Rio de Janeiro (city)|Rio de Janeiro]], but that now encompasses educated urban pronunciations from the different speech communities in the southeast. In that standard, {{angbr|s}} represents the phoneme {{IPA|/s/}} when it appears at the end of a syllable (whereas in Rio de Janeiro this represents {{IPA|/ʃ/}}) the [[rhotic consonant]] spelled {{angbr|r}} is pronounced {{IPA|[h]}} in the same situation (whereas in [[São Paulo (city)|São Paulo]] this is usually an [[alveolar flap]] or [[alveolar trill|trill]]). European and African dialects have differing realizations of {{IPA|/ʁ/}} than Brazilian dialects, with the former using {{IPA|[ʁ]}} and {{IPA|[r]}} and the latter using {{IPA|[x]}}, {{IPA|[h]}}, or {{IPA|[χ]}}.&lt;ref&gt;Mateus, Maria Helena &amp; d'Andrade, Ernesto (2000) ''The Phonology of Portuguese'' {{ISBN|0-19-823581-X}} [http://fds.oup.com/www.oup.co.uk/pdf/0-19-823581-X.pdf (Excerpt from Google Books)] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070628065105/http://fds.oup.com/www.oup.co.uk/pdf/0-19-823581-X.pdf |date=2007-06-28 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6436">The '''Survey of California and Other Indian Languages''' (originally the '''Survey of California Indian Languages''') at the [[University of California at Berkeley]] [[language documentation|documents]], catalogs, and archives the [[indigenous languages of the Americas]]. The survey also hosts events related to [[language revitalization]] and preservation.

==Origins==
The Survey was started as a pilot project by [[University of California, Berkeley|Berkeley]] [[linguistics]] professor [[Murray Emeneau]]&lt;ref name="sfcronObit"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/c/a/2005/09/12/BAGCKEM6UU1.DTL |title=Murray Emeneau -- famed UC Berkeley linguist |work= The San Francisco Chronicle|accessdate=2009-06-08 | first=Patrick | last=Hoge |date=2005-09-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Mary Haas]] in 1953.&lt;ref name="golla1997"&gt;{{Cite journal | pages = 550–555 | last = Golla | first = V.  | title = The Formative Influences on Mary R. Haas's Career | journal = Anthropological Linguistics | year = 1997 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It was established with an official budget on January 1, 1953.&lt;ref name="mclendonBio"&gt;{{Cite journal| volume = 39| issue = 4| pages = 522–543| last = McLendon| first = S.| title = Mary R. Haas: A Life in Linguistics| jstor=30028484|journal = Anthropological Linguistics| year = 1997}}&lt;/ref&gt; Haas was a particular influence on the early working culture of the Survey. One student, [[Brent D. Galloway]], recalled&lt;ref name="gallowayNatchez"&gt;{{Cite journal | volume = 39 | issue = 4 | pages = 636–641 [640] | last = Galloway | first = B.  | title = Recollections of Mary R. Haas as Teacher, Supervisor, and Inspiration | journal = Anthropological Linguistics | year = 1997 }}&lt;/ref&gt; how several of Haas' students had used a [[Natchez language|Natchez]] greeting, ''wanhetahnú·ʼis'', and that "the tradition had apparently continued for over twenty years." (Haas' first publication had been on Natchez.) 

The first project was a study of the [[Karuk language]] by [[William Bright]], then a graduate student.&lt;ref name="shipley1988"&gt;{{cite book | last = Shipley | first = William | title = In Honour of Mary Haas | publisher = Walter de Gruyter &amp; Co | location = City | year = 1988 | isbn = 3-11-011165-9 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Since its founding 80 doctoral dissertations have been written under the auspices of the Survey.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url= http://linguistics.berkeley.edu/~survey/resources/dissertations.php|title=Survey of California and Other Indian Languages, University of California, Berkeley|work=linguistics.berkeley.edu|accessdate=May 2, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Publications==

The Survey published a series of "Reports" beginning in 1981, covering a variety of topics related to languages of California as well as Native American languages elsewhere. Some volumes were standalone works such as dictionaries, others were collections of varied articles.&lt;ref name=surveyReports&gt;{{Cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Beginning in 1976 the Survey began publishing the proceedings of Hokan–Penutian Workshop, which addressed the proposed [[Hokan languages|Hokan]] and [[Penutian]] language families.&lt;ref name=hokanPenutian&gt;{{Cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Both resources are available online.

In 2011, a grant from the [[National Endowment for the Humanities]] made it possible to merge online resources from the Survey of California and Other Indian Languages and the Berkeley Language Center (BLC) into a single website, the [[California Language Archive]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web

'''Texan English''' is the array of [[American English]] spoken in [[Texas]], primarily falling under the regional dialects of [[Southern American English|Southern]] and [[Midland American English|Midland U.S. English]]. As one extensive study states, at the most basic level, the typical Texan accent is a "Southern accent with a twist."&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"&gt;{{cite web|title=Caricatures by Leslie Ward in Vanity Fair - Do You Speak American . Sea to Shining Sea . American Varieties . Texan . Drawl |work=pbs.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; The "twist" refers to major features of the [[Deep South|Lower]] and [[Upper South]] coming into contact with one another, as well as some notable influences derived from an early Spanish-speaking population and German immigrants.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"/&gt; In fact, there is no single accent that covers all of Texas and few dialect features are unique only to Texas. The most advanced (i.e., newest and most developed) accent features of the regional Southern U.S. dialect are reported in [[North Texas|North]] and [[West Texas]] (but not El Paso),&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://emedia.leeward.hawaii.edu/hurley/Ling102web/mod2_identity/2mod2.3.2US.htm |title=Mod 2 Lesson 2.3.2 American Regional Dialects |publisher=Emedia.leeward.hawaii.edu |date= |accessdate=2015-11-20 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150327063207/http://emedia.leeward.hawaii.edu/hurley/Ling102web/mod2_identity/2mod2.3.2US.htm |archive-date=2015-03-27 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; associated with the Upper South, while elements of the same regional dialect are present but less consistent in [[East Texas|East]] and [[South Texas]], associated more with the Lower South.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt; In South Texas, particularly, [[Mexican Spanish]] characteristics are heavily influential as well.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.pbs.org/speak/seatosea/americanvarieties/texan/|title=Do You Speak American . Sea to Shining Sea . American Varieties . Texan - PBS|work=pbs.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Abilene, Texas|Abilene]], [[Austin, Texas|Austin]], [[Corpus Christi, Texas|Corpus Christi]] appear to align to the Midland regional accent of the United States more than the Southern regional one; [[El Paso]] aligns to the [[Western American English|Western regional accent]]; and [[Dallas]] is greatly variable.&lt;ref name="Labov"/&gt;

==Regional divisions of Texan English==

English in Texas is not universal in every region of the state, and its dialect boundaries, in general, are rather vague; however, most of its dialects are classifiable under the larger Midland and Southern regional dialects of the United States. Scholar Bagby Atwood stated "I will not draw lines showing the limits of Southwestern [English] or any of its subareas. Far too many lines have been drawn already, probably by popular demand and certainly on insufficient evidence, purporting to show the limits of speech areas in the West".&lt;ref name="Atwood"/&gt; Nevertheless, since 1935 and into the twentieth century, various linguists attempted to delimit Texas into dialect regions, although the evidence for their division was insufficient.&lt;ref name=Underwood&gt;Underwood, Gary N. (1990), "Scholarly Responsibility and the Representation of Dialects: The Case of English in Texas", ''Journal of English Linguistics'' 23: 95-112.&lt;/ref&gt;{{clarify|reason=How exactly was it "insufficient"?|date=December 2017}}

The largest group of those researchers divides Texan English into two regional varieties though with each researcher suggesting different boundaries than the others.&lt;ref name="Underwood"/&gt; Some linguists draw their boundaries based upon [[Phonology|phonological]] (sound) differences and others on lexical (word) differences, and research data can sometimes be conjectural.&lt;ref name=Underwood/&gt; Some linguists often regard East and South Texas as a particular dialect region, disagreeing on its western extension.&lt;ref name="Underwood"/&gt; Another set of linguists divide "Texas linguistically in a more general East–West fashion".&lt;ref name="Underwood"/&gt; According to Craig Carver, Texas can be delimited into two dialect regions: "a south Texas layer that runs by-and-large along the Texas–Mexico border and reaches up to San Antonio, and a [[central Texas]] region that includes the areas where large numbers of speakers of German and other [[European language]]s settled" (Carver in Walters).&lt;ref name=Walters&gt;Walters, Keith. [http://www.tshaonline.org/handbook/online/articles/pcd01 "Dialects"]. ''Handbook of Texas Online''.  Texas State Historical Association. Web. 14 August 2012&lt;/ref&gt;

Frederic Cassidy divides Texas into a border that "runs between Texarkana and Longview in East Texas and extends westward to the region south of [[Dallas]] and [[Fort Worth]] before curving southward clearly to the west of [[Waco]], [[Austin, Texas|Austin]], and [[San Antonio]], putting all of the [[Lower Rio Grande Valley]] in the eastern zone" (Cassidy 1982:202 in Underwood, 106).&lt;ref name="Underwood"/&gt; In contrast, Terry Jordan’s "line turns south between [[Longview, Texas|Longview]] and [[Tyler, Texas|Tyler]], snakes its way southeast of [[Bryan–College Station]], curves westward through [[Gonzales County, Texas|Gonzales County]] to the east of San Antonio, and turns back in a southeastern direction to [[Lavaca Bay]] just east of [[Victoria, Texas|Victoria]]" (Jordan 1984:97, in Underwood, 106).&lt;ref name="Underwood"/&gt;

As [[Anglo-American ethnic group|Anglo-American]] settlers dominated central Texas, the influence of the German language in central Texas is proportionally less important than the influence of the Spanish language in [[south Texas]].&lt;ref name="Carver"&gt;Carver, Craig M. (1987), ''American regional dialects : a word geography''. Ann Arbor: University of Michigan Press.&lt;/ref&gt; The South Texas Layer lies south of the [[San Antonio River]] and is distinguished by a large number of Spanish [[loanword]]s.&lt;ref name="Carver"/&gt; The Central Texas Layer is characterized by German features, due to the large numbers of settlers.&lt;ref name="Carver"/&gt; The Texan word ''clook'' (= a setting hen), which derived from the German word ''Glucke'', is pronounced with the original German high back [[vowel]] /ʊ/, whereas in other regions it is ''cluck'' and it is pronounced with the central vowel /ʌ/. In addition, the Central Texas layer is influenced by several dialects of other [[South Atlantic States]] and Northern States, due to settlement history.&lt;ref name="Carver"/&gt;

==Phonology==
There are many [[Phonology|phonological]] processes which are characteristic for Texan speech. However, those processes are on no account universal in Texan English and each Texan may speak only some of the characteristics displayed below or even none. In addition, other regional dialects in the United States or [[dialects]] from other countries may share some of these features. In particular, dialects from other Southern states share many phonological characteristics of the language spoken in [[Texas]].
* Phonemic distinctions: In many areas of North America phonemic distinctions rapidly disappear. Although these distinctions are also vanishing in Texas, distinctions between {{IPA|/hw/}} and {{IPA|/w/}}, {{IPA|/oʊr/}} and {{IPA|/ɔːr/}}, and {{IPA|/juː/}} and {{IPA|/uː/}} in words which sound very similar are still very common. In fact, the [[Southern United States|South]] is the most conservative area in the United States regarding the retention of phonemic distinctions. In [[Central Texas|central]], [[Northern Texas|northern]] and [[eastern Texas]] this phonetic phenomenon is especially widespread.&lt;ref name="Labov"&gt;Labov, William, Sharon Ash, and Charles Boberg. ''Atlas of North American English: Phonetics, Phonology and Sound Change''.  Berlin: Mouton de Gruyter, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;
:*Absence of the [[wine–whine merger]]: Most Texans distinguish the {{IPA|/hw/}} of ''whale'' and ''whether'' from the {{IPA|/w/}} of ''wail'' and ''weather''. In most dialects of English, {{IPA|/hw/}} and {{IPA|/w/}} are {{IPA|[w]}} in all cases.
:*Absence of the [[horse–hoarse merger]]: Parts of Texas, particularly the [[Dallas]] and [[Lubbock, Texas|Lubbock]] areas, do not merge {{IPA|/oʊr/}} and {{IPA|/ɔːr/}}.
:*Absence of [[yod-dropping]]: Some speakers in the Dallas area distinguish ''dew'' {{IPA|/djuː/}} and ''do'' {{IPA|/duː/}}.&lt;ref name="Labov"/&gt;
* Monophthongization of {{IPA|/aɪ/}} before voiced consonants and word-final position: A vast majority of Texans monophthongize {{IPA|/aɪ/}} to {{IPA|[aː]}}. Thus, ''buy'' is realized as {{IPA|[baː]}}, ''guy'' as {{IPA|[gaː]}}, ''time'' as {{IPA|[taːm]}}, ''side'' as {{IPA|[saːd]}}, etc. While this is widespread, it is absent in Austin and [[southern Texas]], especially [[Corpus Christi, Texas|Corpus Christi]].
* Monophthongization of {{IPA|/aɪ/}} before voiceless consonants: This is concentrated in central Texas and [[San Antonio]]. In these areas, over 50% of {{IPA|/aɪ/}} tokens show monophthongization to {{IPA|[aː]}} before [[voiceless consonant]]s. This makes words like ''mite'', ''rice'', ''life'', ''type'', etc. sound like {{IPA|[maːt]}}, {{IPA|[raːs]}}, {{IPA|[laːf]}}, and {{IPA|[taːp]}}.&lt;ref name="Labov"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Feagin"&gt;Feagin, Crawford. "Vowel Shifting in the Southern States." ''English in the Southern United States''. Ed. Stephen J. Nagle and Sara L. Sanders. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 2003. 126-140.&lt;/ref&gt;
* The [[cot-caught merger]]: The historical  non-merger distinction between the two vowels sounds {{IPA|/ɔː/}} and {{IPA|/ɒ/}}, in words like ''caught'' and ''cot'' or ''stalk'' and ''stock'' is mainly preserved. However, the cot–caught merger is becoming increasingly common throughout the United States, thus affecting Southeastern and even some Southern dialects, towards a merged vowel {{IPA|[ɑ]}}.&lt;ref name="Bailey2"&gt;Bailey, Guy. "Directions of Change in Texas English.".''Journal of American Culture'' 14.2 (1991): 125-134.&lt;/ref&gt;
*Texan dialects are [[rhotic and non-rhotic accents|rhotic]]; {{IPA|/r/}} is pronounced in all environments.
*The [[intrusive r|intrusive /r/]]: The intrusion of {{IPA|/r/}} in some (usually older) speakers makes words like ''Washington'' sound like ''War-shington''.&lt;ref name="Bailey2"/&gt;
* The [[pin-pen merger]]: Many Texans pronounce the word ''pen'' like the word ''pin''. Also other words like ''ten'' and ''tin'', ''Wendy'' and ''windy'', ''Ken'' and ''kin'', ''send'' and ''sinned'' are pronounced the same.&lt;ref&gt;[http://ils.unc.edu/afporch/audio/dialect/41.html "Pin-Pen Merger."] ''The American Front Porch''. The University of North Carolina. 5 Sept. 2012&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Bigham, Doug. [http://www.utexas.edu/cola/depts/linguistics/events/11277 "The PIN~PEN Merger: Movement of Front Vowel Allophones in Pre-Nasal Position."] Department of Linguistics at the University of Texas. 2007. Accessed 5 September 2012&lt;/ref&gt;
* The relation of {{IPA|/eɪ/}} in ''bait'' to {{IPA|/ɛ/}} in ''bet'': There are four possible relations of the {{IPA|/eɪ/}} to {{IPA|/ɛ/}}:
# {{IPA|/ɛ/}} is lower and backer than {{IPA|/eɪ/}} which is the most conservative situation.
# {{IPA|/ɛ/}} has moved to a fronter position but it remains lower.
# {{IPA|/ɛ/}} is higher but remains backer than {{IPA|/eɪ/}}.
# {{IPA|/ɛ/}} reversed its original relation to {{IPA|/eɪ/}} by being higher and fronter.
: It appears that the fourth situation is the most widespread in Texas. There are only the southeast of Texas and a few other places in which the fourth situation is not the most common.  In parts of [[Amarillo, Texas|Amarillo]], [[Abilene, Texas|Abilene]], [[Austin, Texas|Austin]] and [[Houston]], for instance, {{IPA|/ɛ/}} is lower and backer than {{IPA|/eɪ/}}. In a few other areas around Houston {{IPA|/ɛ/}} is lower and fronter than {{IPA|/eɪ/}}.&lt;ref name="Labov"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Feagin"/&gt;
* The glide deletion and monophthongization to {{IPA|[oː]}} of {{IPA|/ɔɪ/}} in oil: The glide deletion of {{IPA|/ɔɪ/}} is much less frequent than the glide deletion of {{IPA|/aɪ/}}. It mostly appears before {{IPA|/l/}} as in ''oil'', ''toilet'', ''spoil'', etc. The only other environment in which the glide deletion of {{IPA|/ɔɪ/}} occasionally comes along is before {{IPA|/s/}} as in ''moisture'', ''voice'', ''oyster'', etc. In Texas glide deletion of {{IPA|/ɔɪ/}} was only noted in parts of West Texas (Lubbock to the Midland/Odessa area) and in parts around Dallas.&lt;ref name="Labov"/&gt;
* Few younger speakers realize the {{sc2|TRAP}} vowel {{IPA|/æ/}} as open front {{IPAblink|a}}. This lowering occurs only in speakers with the cot-caught merger, and is not yet as common as in [[California English|California]] and [[Canadian English|Canada]].&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|last=Thomas|first=Erik R.|editor-last=Schneider|editor-first=Edgar W.|editor2-last=Burridge|editor2-first=Kate|editor3-last=Kortmann|editor3-first=Bernd|editor4-last=Mesthrie|editor4-first=Rajend|editor5-last=Upton|editor5-first=Clive|year=2004|title=A handbook of varieties of English|chapter=Rural Southern white accents|volume=1: Phonology|publisher=Mouton de Gruyter|page=308|isbn=3-11-017532-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Changes in phonology===
Linguists propose that [[urbanization]], geographic and [[Social mobility in the United States|social mobility]], and the [[mass media]] have homogenized the speech of the United States to a national norm.&lt;ref name="Bailey"&gt;Bailey, Guy. "Directions of Change in Texas English." ''Journal of American Culture'' 14.2 (1991): 125-134.&lt;/ref&gt; Consequently, dialect differences are disappearing.

Due to rapid urbanization, increasing dominance of [[high tech]] industries, and massive migration Texan speech has been reshaped as well, especially since 1990.&lt;ref name="Texan English"/&gt;  Whereas these changes are mainly [[Phonology|phonological]] phenomena, changes in the Lexicon of Texan English can be detected as well. As much of the traditional regional vocabulary concerned farming and rural life these terms are now disappearing or being replaced by technical (book) terms.&lt;ref name="Bailey"/&gt; The general tendency in the phonology of Texas English is that mergers expand at the expense of distinctions although traditionally, Texan Speech was determined by phonemic distinctions.&lt;ref name="Bailey"/&gt; Guy Bailey identifies 11 changes:

*the [[cot–caught merger|''cot–caught'' merger]]&lt;ref name="Bailey"/&gt;
*the "monophthongization" of {{IPAc-en|aɪ}} in words like ''night'' so that outsiders, but never Texans, often perceive ''night'' and ''not'' as homophones&lt;ref name="Bailey"/&gt;
*three [[English-language vowel changes before historic /l/|mergers before /l/]]:
**the ''fill–feel'' merger&lt;ref name="Bailey"/&gt;
**the ''fell–fail'' merger&lt;ref name="Bailey"/&gt;
**the ''full–fool'' merger&lt;ref name="Bailey"/&gt;
*[[Phonological history of English consonant clusters#Reduction of /hj/|reduction of /hj/]] so that words like ''Hugh'' and ''you'' become homophones&lt;ref name="Bailey"/&gt;
*[[Phonological history of English consonant clusters#Yod-dropping|yod-dropping]] after {{IPAc-en|t|,_|d|,_|n}} so that words like ''due'' and ''do'' become homophones&lt;ref name="Bailey"/&gt;
*the intrusion of {{IPAc-en|r}} in words like ''Washington''&lt;ref name="Bailey"/&gt;
*the "loss" of {{IPAc-en|r}} after vowels in words like ''forty'';&lt;ref name="Bailey"/&gt; this has reversed on a massive scale, now only heard in older speakers
*the variation of {{IPAc-en|ɑːr}} and {{IPAc-en|ɔːr}} so that ''lord'' often sounds like ''lard''&lt;ref name="Bailey"/&gt;
*the fronting and raising of the first element of the diphthong {{IPAc-en|aʊ}} in words like ''house''; this change only occurs among the white population of Texas and it has had little effect on the speech of [[Hispanic]] and [[African Americans]]&lt;ref name="Bailey"/&gt;

Texan English phonology stereotypically is defined by the monophthongization of /aɪ/ (e.g. ''price'' is pronounced like [pɹaːs]),&lt;ref name="Jung"&gt;Jung, Natalie A. (2011) "Real-Time Changes in the Vowel System of Central Texas English". "Texas Linguistics Forum" 54:72-78.&lt;/ref&gt; which is best reported in Dallas, Lubbock, and Odessa;&lt;ref&gt;Labov et al., 2006, p. 246&lt;/ref&gt; other Texan cities, however, are reported as usually preserving the diphthong pronunciation of /aɪ/ (e.g. ''price'' pronounced as [pɹaɪs]).&lt;ref name="Jung"/&gt; Latest findings show a strong orientation of primarily young and urban Texans towards a diphthongization of /aɪ/. In fact, the monophthongization of /aɪ/ has left the central Texan speech almost entirely.&lt;ref name="Jung"/&gt; 89% of the "younger" speakers aged 21–30, use diphthongal realizations of /aɪ/, whereas only 11% use monophthongal or intermediate realizations of /aɪ/.&lt;ref name="Jung"/&gt; The change toward the diphthongization of /aɪ/ is led by young female Texans, as 92% of the 11% still using the monophthongization were males.

===Urban–rural contrast===
Another linguistic change in Texan English is an emerging rural–urban split, meaning that most stereotypically and traditionally Southern or Texan features remain strong in rural areas, whereas many of these features tend to disappear in large urban areas and small cities.&lt;ref name="Texan English"/&gt; The urban-rural linguistic split mainly affects phonological phenomena. 
*The pen/pin merger, the loss of the offglide in /aɪ/, and upgliding diphthongs are now recessive in metropolitan areas.
*Traditional grammatical features like y’all and fixin’ to are expanding to [[wikt:non-native|non-natives]] in metropolitan areas as well as to the Hispanic population.&lt;ref name="Texan English"/&gt;
*New features are developing, mainly in urban areas, for example vowels in words like ''caught'' and ''cot'' are becoming merged (both sound like cot).&lt;ref name="Texan English"/&gt;
*Tense/lax vowel pairs before /l/ (e.g. pool-pull, feel-fill, sale-sell) are now homophones.&lt;ref name="Texan English"/&gt;

==Grammar==
[[Southern American English]] has unique grammatical features which do not occur in [[Standard English]], and as settlement patterns indicate, Texas English shares many of these characteristics with other states of the [[American South]].

===Y’all===

No other grammatical feature has been more associated with [[Southern American English]] than ''y’all'' as the second person plural pronoun. As a list of phonological and grammatical features documented in Texas by [[Guy Bailey]] shows, it is also used frequently in Texan English.&lt;ref name="Bail"&gt;Bailey, Guy. "When Did Southern American English Begin?" ''Old Englishes and Beyond: Studies in Honour of Manfred Gorlach''. Ed. Edgar Schneider. Amsterdam: John Benjamins, 1997. 255-275.
.&lt;/ref&gt; As David B. Parker found out, the term ''y’all'' first appeared in the [[Southern Literary Messenger]] (published in [[Richmond, Virginia]]) in April 1858.&lt;ref name="Parker"&gt;Parker, David B. "Y’All: Two Early Examples." ''American Speech'' 81.1 (2006): 110-112. .&lt;/ref&gt; The term was used by an American [[humorist]] of the mid-nineteenth century, "Mozis Addums," penname of George William Bagby, describing the crowded conditions in the Washington D.C. [[boarding house]] where he was living:

:"Packin uv pork in a meet house, which you should be keerful it don't git hot at the bone, and prizin uv tobakker, which y’all’s Winstun nose how to do it, givs you a parshil idee, but only parshil".&lt;ref name="Bagby"&gt;Bagby, Georege William. ''The letters of Mozis Addums to Billy Ivvins''. Richmond: West &amp; Johnson, 1862. .&lt;/ref&gt;

The origin of ''y’all'' is an often debated question. Some clearly see it as a contraction of ''you'' and ''all'' whereas others like Montgomery point out the primary stress on ''you'' and the secondary on ''all'' would create ''you’ll'' as a contraction instead of ''y’all''.&lt;ref name="Montgomery"&gt;Montgomery, Michael. "The Etymology of ‘Y’all’."  ''Old English and New: Studies in Language and Linguistics in Honor of Frederic G. Cassidy''. Ed. Joan H. Hall, Nick Doane, and Dick Ringler, New York: Garland, 1992. 356–67..&lt;/ref&gt;
Thus sees it as a grammaticalized form of ''you'' coming from the [[Scots language|Scots]]-Irish ''ye aw''. This leads to the next question of ''y’all'' being used as only [[plural]] or also [[Singular (grammatical number)|singular]]. Montgomery describes ''y’all'' as having the following six properties:&lt;ref name="Montgomery2"&gt;Montgomery, Michael. "Future of Southern American English." ''SECOL Review'' 20 (1996): 1–24.&lt;/ref&gt;

#a [[paradigmatic]] gap for plural ''you''
#an associative plural, including individuals associated, but not present with the singular addressee
#an institutional plural addressed to one person representing a group
#an unknown potential referent
#a form used in direct address in certain contexts (e.g., partings, greetings, invitations, and vocatives)
#a stylistic choice distinct in tone (e.g., in intimacy, familiarity, and informality).&lt;ref&gt;Ching, Marvin K.L. "Plural You/Ya’ll Variation by a Court Judge: Situational Use." ''American Speech''. 76.2 (2001): 115-127.&lt;/ref&gt;

Most linguists, however, agree on ''y’all'' being used as the second person plural [[pronoun]] and therefore no singular reference is possible. (Note that an associative plural ''y'all'' might be used in the context of a single person, but its ''reference'' is always strictly plural.)

''All y'all'' may be used to refer to a broader group of people when ''y'all'' has already referred to a constituent subgroup. ''All y'alls'' may then expand the group of reference to another degree.

===Fixin' to===

:(a)	''It’s fixin' to rain''&lt;ref name="Wolfram"&gt;Wolfram, Walt. "Toward a Description of A-Prefixing in Appalachian English." ''American Speech'', 51.1-2 (1976): 45-56.&lt;/ref&gt;
:(b)	''I was fixin' to come but I got held up''&lt;ref name="Wolfram 3"&gt;Wolfram, Walt, and Natalie Schilling-Estes. ''American English: Dialects and Variation''. Malden: Blackwell Publishing, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

It is not clear where the term comes from and when it was first used. According to dialect dictionaries, ''fixin' to'' is associated with southern speech and is most often defined as being a [[synonym]] of ''preparing to'' or ''intending to''.&lt;ref name="Bernstein"&gt;Bernstein, Cynthia. "Grammatical features of southern speech: y'all, might could, and fixin' to." ''English in the Southern United States''. Eds. Stephen J. Nagel and Sara L. Sanders, Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 2003. 106-119.&lt;/ref&gt; In sentences like (a) fixin' to may mean something like "about to" or "planning to". Sentence (b) expresses more the intention of doing something, in this case the speaker intended to come.&lt;ref name="Wolfram 3"/&gt; However, some linguists, i.e. Marvin K. Ching, regard it as being a ''quasimodal'' rather than a [[verb]] followed by an [[infinitive]].&lt;ref name="Ching"&gt;Ching, Marvin K. L. "How Fixed Is Fixin’ to?" ''American Speech'', 62.4 (1987): 332-345.&lt;/ref&gt; As can be found in the [[Linguistic Atlas of the Gulf States]], the term is used by 57% of the population of Upper Texas and by 43% in Lower Texas.&lt;ref name="Pederson"&gt;Pederson, Lee, ed. ''Linguistic Atlas of the Gulf States: Social Pattern for the Linguistic Atlas of the Gulf States''. Athens: University of Georgia Press, 1992.
&lt;/ref&gt; It is a term used by all [[social groups]], although more frequently by people with a lower [[social status]] than by members of the educated [[upper classes]]. Furthermore, it is more common in the speech of younger people than in that of older people.&lt;ref name="Bernstein"/&gt; The term is also more prevalent in rural areas than in urban areas. In addition, the term functions as an indicator for being from the South. As Ching points out, the precise meaning of the term "depends much upon its inherent linguistic meaning, which changes in shades of meaning with lexical and syntactic choice".&lt;ref name="Ching"/&gt; In other words, the term is used in different situations with a variety of meanings. Nevertheless, the meaning is mostly clear to speaker and addressee when used in a particular situation and when both actors are familiar with the term ''fixin' to''.

===Multiple modals===

[[Standard English]] has a strict [[word order]]. In the case of [[Modal auxiliary verb|modal auxiliaries]] Standard English is restricted to a single modal per [[verb phrase]]. Nevertheless, Texans have constructions which combine more than one [[modal auxiliary]] within the same verb phrase: ''I might could do that''.

These constructions are used by every social class and are, as proven by the data of the Linguistic Atlas of the Gulf States, predominately used in the eastern parts of Texas (Upper East Texas and Lower East Texas). There are different opinions on which class preferably uses the term. Atwood,&lt;ref name="Atwood1"&gt;Atwood, E. Bagby. ''A Survey of Verb Forms in the Eastern United States''. Ann Arbor: University of Michigan Press, 1953.&lt;/ref&gt; for example, finds that educated people try to avoid multiple modals, whereas Montgomery&lt;ref name="Montgomery 3"&gt;Montgomery, Michael. "Multiple Modals In LAGS and LAMSAS". ''From the Gulf States and Beyond: the legacy of Lee Pederson and LAGS''. Eds. Michael Montgomery &amp; Thomas E. Nunnaly, Tuscaloosa: The University of Alabama Press, 1998.&lt;/ref&gt; suggests the opposite. Considering all findings of different linguists who examined multiple modals in Southern speech, it can be said that multiple modals are quite widespread and are not particularly stigmatized.&lt;ref name="Wolfram 3"/&gt;

Possible double modals used by Texans as examined by Di Paolo are:&lt;ref name="Di Paolo"&gt;Di Paolo, Marianna. "Double Modals as Single Lexical Items." American Speech, 64.3 (1989): 195-224.&lt;/ref&gt;

As the table shows, there are only possible combinations of an [[epistemic]] modal followed by [[deontic]] modals in multiple modal constructions. Deontic modals express permissibility with a range from obligated to forbidden and are mostly used as markers of politeness in requests whereas epistemic modals refer to probabilities from certain to impossible.&lt;ref name="Bernstein"/&gt; Multiple modals combine these two modalities.

The origin of multiple modals is controversial. Some say it is a development of [[Modern English]], others found out that double modals already existed in [[Middle English]] and again others suggest that it derives from [[Scottish American|Scots]]-[[Irish American|Irish]] settlers.&lt;ref name="Bernstein"/&gt;

===Other grammatical features===

Beside the three already mentioned grammatical features, there are a few others which aren’t used or are only rarely used today:

====a-prefixing====

Examples: 
:(a) ''I know he wasn’t a-telling the truth''
:(b) ''He come a-running out there and got shot''
:(c) ''She kept a-running''
:(d) ''She continued a-crying''

The construction is called ''a-prefixing'', because the ''a'' is seen as a [[prefix]] placed before the ''–ing'' [[participle]] form. Most often it occurs with progressive forms as it is the case in sentence (a). Other syntactic contexts in which a-prefixing occurs are as in sentence (b), with movement words such as ''come'', ''go'' and ''take off'' or together with words of starting and continuing such as in sentence (c) and (d). Together with these words it functions as a type of adverbial complement to the verb.&lt;ref name="Wolfram"/&gt;

Phonological restrictions of a-prefixing include that only verbs accented on the initial syllable can occur in the form of ''a'' plus ''verb-ing'': ''a-fóllowin'' but not *''a-discóverin''.&lt;ref name="Wolfram 3"/&gt; Moreover, it cannot occur on ''–ing'' forms functioning as nouns or adjectives. Thus, sentences like ''*the movie was a-charmin’'' are ungrammatical.&lt;ref name="Wolfram 3"/&gt; 'A' can only be a prefix of verbs or complements of verbs with ''–ing''.&lt;ref name="Wolfram 3"/&gt; As Frazer found out a-prefixing is more likely to be found in the speech of elderly people and might therefore disappear in a few years.&lt;ref name="Frazer"&gt;Frazer, Timothy C. "More on the Semantics of A-Prefixing." ''American Speech'', 65.1 (1990): 89-93.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Plural verbal ''-s''====

:''Our father and mother sends you their blessings''.

This kind of grammatical feature is most often used in [[Black English Vernacular]] but also white people in Texas use it.&lt;ref name="Bailey 3"&gt;Bailey, Guy, Natalie Minor, and Patricia Cukor-Avila. "Variation in Subject-Verb Concord in Early Modern English." Language Variation and Change, 1 (1989): 285-300.&lt;/ref&gt; Bailey, Maynor and Cukor-Avila examined that 70% of the black population and 43% of the white population put an ''–s'' on the third person plural in folk speech.&lt;ref name="Bailey 3"/&gt; But here again the use of the third person singular marker ''–s'' in the plural is also declining in frequency.

====Existential ''it''====

:(a) ''It is nothing more to say''.
:(b) ''It is a friend of mine who likes to hear that kind of music''.

Standard English would prefer: ''There is nothing more to say'' and in the second example: ''There is a friend of mine who likes to hear that kind of music''.

Accordingly, in Texan English some people use ''existential it'' instead of ''existential there''. ''Existential there'' is used to say that something exists rather than saying where it is located.&lt;ref name="Online Dict"&gt;[http://www.odlt.org/definitionsOut/existential_it.html "Existential it."] ''Online Dictionary of Language Terminology''. 4 Oct 2012&lt;/ref&gt; The construction can be found in [[Middle English]] as in Marlowe's Edward II: "Cousin, it is no dealing with him now".&lt;ref name="Online Dict"/&gt;

====like't'a====

:''I like't'a died''&lt;ref name="Bailey Tillery"&gt;Bailey, Guy, and Jan Tillery. "The Persistence of Southern American English." ''Journal of English Linguistics'', 24.4 (1996): 308-321.&lt;/ref&gt;

Like't'a is a conjunction of "like to have" coming from [[Appalachian English]]. It is most often seen as a synonym of almost. Accordingly, the phrase ''I like't'a died'' would be ''I almost died'' in Standard English. With this meaning, ''like't'a'' can be seen as a verb [[Modifier (grammar)|modifier]] for actions that are on the verge of happening.&lt;ref name="Wolfram 3"/&gt; Furthermore, it is more often used in figurative than in a literal sense.&lt;ref name="Wolfram 3"/&gt;

====Perfective or completive done====

:(a)	''She done left''&lt;ref name="Bailey Tillery"/&gt;
:(b)	''I done told you not to mess up''&lt;ref name="Wolfram 3"/&gt;

The past participle form of ''do'' together with a past verb form may be used to emphasize the whole action as in sentence (b) or to put emphasis on the completion of the action as in sentence (a). The form can be found not only in Texan English, but also in other varieties of [[Southern American English]] and [[African-American English|African American vernaculars]].&lt;ref name="Wolfram 3"/&gt;

==Lexicon==
Many of these lexical terms are shared with the Midland and Southern dialects generally:
*''buzzard'': vulture
*''blue norther'': The term ''blue norther'' refers to a weather phenomenon that often appears in the [[temperate zone]]s all over the world (including Texas).  It is a quickly moving autumnal [[cold front]] which drops the temperatures rapidly and brings along rain and after a period of blue skies and cold weather. The derivation of this term is unclear. Some people say that the term refers to a norther (borealis/north wind) which sweeps "out of the Panhandle under a blue-black sky" – from the heat to the blue black cold. Others suggest that ''blue norther''  denotes the color of the sky that appears after the bad weather front has passed. Yet others say that people associate blue with the cold that the front brings along. Variants of this term are ''blue whistler'', ''blue darter'' and ''blue blizzard''. Whereas the term ''blue whistler'' is also used in Texas the two latter terms are from out of state. ''Blue norther'', however, is purely Texan. Since Spanish times, the effect of blue norther has been noted in Texas and this phenomenon has often been exaggerated.  But contrary to the belief of many people blue norther is not unique to Texas.&lt;ref name="Barkley"&gt;Barkley, Roy. [http://www.tshaonline.org/handbook/online/articles/ybb01 "Blue Norther"] .2012. Texas State Historical Association. 5 Sept 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Metcalf"/&gt;
*''bowie knife'': a long hunting knife (pronounced ''boo-ee''). Named for Alamo hero Jim Bowie.
*''dogie'': calf.&lt;ref name="Texas English"&gt;[https://www.pbs.org/speak/seatosea/americanvarieties/texan/ "Texas English"]. ''Do you speak American?'' Web. 14 August 2012&lt;/ref&gt;
*''fixin' to'': a future-tense modal verb analogous to "about to" in much of [[American English]].&lt;ref name=american /&gt; ''E.g.,'' "I'm '''fixin' to''' leave for school."
*''geddup'': outfit (clothing)
*''howdy'': a general greeting; a shortened form of "How do you do?"&lt;ref name="talk"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tshaonline.org/handbook/online/articles/ybb01|title=The Handbook of Texas Online}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*''looker'': an attractive woman&lt;ref name=talk /&gt;
*''maverick'': stray or unbranded.&lt;ref name="Texas English"/&gt;
*''motte (mot)'': The term ''motte'' or ''mot'' refers to a small grove of trees in open grasslands. It was first introduced by [[Irish American|Irish]] immigrants in the 1830s. They brought this term from Ireland where people used to call similar woods this way. In the United States one hears of motte only in Texas.&lt;ref name="Metcalf"/&gt;
*''[[skunk|pole cat]]'': a skunk&lt;ref name=american /&gt;
*''shinnery'': ''Shinnery'' is a well-known term in western Texas. It denotes a [[shinnery oak]] or a sand shinnery oak. These trees grow in Texas, western [[Oklahoma]], and eastern [[New Mexico]]. The term shinnery can also mean the area or landscape in which shinnery oaks grow.&lt;ref name="Metcalf"/&gt;
*''spindletop'': a gushing oil well
*''tank'': stock pond.&lt;ref name="Texas English"/&gt;
*''Varmint'': a wild or rascally animal, especially a mammal (sometimes used endearingly). Derivative of ''vermin''. 
*''[[y'all]]'': a second-person plural pronoun; a shortened form of "you all"&lt;ref name="american"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.pbs.org/speak/seatosea/americanvarieties/texan/drawl/|title=Drawl or Nothin’|work=Do You Speak American?|year=2005|publisher=PBS|accessdate=3 September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*''(over) yonder'': an adverbial used to designate a faraway place; analogous to "over there"&lt;ref name=talk /&gt;

===Texan terms with Spanish origins===
Due to Spain's past influence in Texas, the vocabulary of Texas is much more influenced by Spanish than the vocabulary of other states. Some of the Texan terms that originated from Spanish are listed below.&lt;ref name="Metcalf"/&gt;
*''esplanade'': Sometimes grassy strips between two divided highway lanes are called ''esplanade''.&lt;ref name="Metcalf"/&gt;
*''[[jalapeño]]'': The Spanish word ''jalapeño'' used to be solely Texan. Not until recently did the term start to expand. Now it is well known in other States of the U.S. and many other countries. It refers to a [[hot pepper]] originated from Mexico.&lt;ref name="Metcalf"/&gt;
*''[[lariat]]'' (from Spanish ''la reata''): rope or lasso.&lt;ref name="Carver"/&gt;
*''pinto'' or ''paint'' (from Spanish ''pinto'' = ''painted''): familiar spotted or piebald Western pony.&lt;ref name="Carver"/&gt;
*''remuda'' (from Spanish ''remudar'' = ''to exchange''): spare horse or remount; mainly used in West Texas.&lt;ref name="Carver"/&gt;
*''Tejano'': The noun ''Tejano'' is derived from the Spanish adjective ''tejano'' or ''tejana'' (feminine). It refers to a Hispanic Texan whose heritage is from Texas before Texas was incorporated into the United States. This term also embraces cultural manifestations in language, literature, art, [[Tejano music|music]], cuisine, etc. already in 1824 the author of the Mexican Constitution of 1824, Miguel Ramos Arispe, called the citizens of Texas ''Tejanos''. After the Mexican War the term ''Coahuiltejano'' which contains the term ''Tejano'' denoted the residents of the Mexican state [[Coahuila]] and Texas. Already in 1833 Hispanics in Texas started to identify themselves as ''Tejanos''. In 1855 when the [[San Antonio]] newspaper ''El Bejareño'' reported a letter by [[José Antonio Navarro]] read at the second meeting of the Spanish-speaking members of the [[Bexar County, Texas|Bexar County]] Democratic party the term ''Méjico-Tejano'' first appeared in print . ''Tejano'' occurred more often in speech and texts when the political activity of Hispanics in Texas became pronounced, in particular since the [[Chicano]] movement of the mid-1960s started. This term is common enough that it is considered an item in the Texas lexicon. Other and broader terms used for the same ethnic group are ''[[Hispanic and Latino Americans|Hispanic American]]'', ''[[Hispanic and Latino Americans|Latin American]]'', ''[[Mexican American]]'', ''[[Mexican people|Mexican]]'', and ''[[Chicano]]''.&lt;ref name="Metcalf"&gt;Metcalf, Allan. ''How We Talk: American Regional English Today''. Boston: Houghton Mifflin,2000.&lt;/ref&gt;
*''wrangler'' or ''horse wrangler'' (Anglicized form of the Spanish word ''caballerango''):  a groom; the typical Texas wrangler was "a bachelor and worked with several outfits over the course of his hard career".&lt;ref name="Carver"/&gt;

===Vocabulary of the South Texas layer===
*''acequia'': an irrigation ditch.&lt;ref name="Carver"/&gt;
*''arroyo'': a gulch, ravine, creek bed&lt;ref name="Carver"/&gt;
*''caliche'': a hardened layer of calcium carbonate in the ground.
*''chaparral'': brush-covered terrain&lt;ref name="Carver"/&gt;
*''frijoles'': kidney or pinto beans&lt;ref name="Carver"/&gt;
*''hacienda'': the main house of a ranch&lt;ref name="Carver"/&gt;
*''icehouse'': a term used in the San Antonio area to mean a convenience store. Elsewhere, this denotes an open-air tavern, the origin of which dates back to the times when fresh beer was stored in "ice houses" placed strategically along beer delivery routes for local and regional delivery. Over time these locations began to serve cold beer, since it was stored there already, and other conveniences, such as food items, cigarettes, etc. In more modern times, the surviving ice houses are little more than open air beer bars. It is the "open air" feature (often obtained with multiple garage doors in place of walls), in fact, that distinguishes an ice house from a tavern.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|first=David |last=Hisbrook|title=Texas Primer: The Icehouse|work= [[Texas Monthly]]|date= August 1984|url= http://www.texasmonthly.com/content/texas-primer-icehouse}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*''llano'': a plain&lt;ref name="Carver"/&gt;
*''olla'': an earthenware pot or crock&lt;ref name="Carver"/&gt;
*''pelado'': a catch-all term for low-class and popular-culture people. Now considered an offensive and derogatory word&lt;ref&gt;[[Pelado]]&lt;/ref&gt; 
*''pilon'': a bonus, lagniappe&lt;ref name="Carver"/&gt;
*''reata'': a rope or lasso&lt;ref name="Carver"/&gt;
*''resaca'': a small body of water&lt;ref name="Carver"/&gt;
*''toro'': a bull&lt;ref name="Carver"/&gt;
*''vaquero'' (from Spanish ''vaquero''): a cowboy&lt;ref name="Carver"/&gt;

===Vocabulary of the Central Texas layer===
*''clook, cluck'': (from German ''Glucke'') a setting hen&lt;ref name="Carver" /&gt;
*''cook cheese, kochcase'': (from German ''Kochkäse'' = (literally) ''smearing cheese'') a soft cheese cooked and poured into jars&lt;ref name="Carver" /&gt;
*''grass sack'' or ''gunny sack'':  a burlap bag&lt;ref name="Carver" /&gt;

==Texan English styles, uses, phrases, and sayings==

===Use of conditional syntax===
People from Texas often make use of conditional [[syntax]]es as shown below:&lt;ref name="Johnston"&gt;Johnston, Barbara. "Features and Uses of Southern Style". ''English in the Southern United States''. Eds. Stephen J. Nagle and Sara L. Sanders. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 2003. 189-205.&lt;/ref&gt;

Conditional syntax in requests:
#"I guess you could step out and git some toothpicks and a carton of Camel cigarettes, if you a mind to".
#"If you be good enough to take it, I believe I could stand me a taste".&lt;ref name="Johnston"/&gt;

Conditional syntax in suggestions:
#"I wouldn’t look for’m to show up if I was you".
#"I’d think that wiskey’d be a trifle hot".
Conditional syntax creates a distance between the speaker’s claim and the hearer. It serves to soften obligations or suggestions, make criticisms less personal, and to express politeness, respect, or courtesy.&lt;ref name="Johnston"/&gt;

===Evidentiality===
Texans also often use "evidential" predicates such as think, reckon, believe, guess, have the feeling, etc.:
# "You already said that once, I believe."
#"I wouldn't want to guess, but I have the feeling we'll know soon enough."
#"You reckon we ought to get help?"
#"I don't believe I've ever known one."

Evidential predicates indicate the certainty of the knowledge asserted in the sentence is, or how it was acquired. According to Johnston, evidential predicates nearly always hedge the assertions and allow the respondents to hedge theirs. They protect speakers from the social embarrassment that appears, in case the assertion turns out to be wrong. As is the case with conditional syntax, evidential predicates can also be used to soften criticisms and to afford courtesy or respect.&lt;ref name="Johnston"/&gt;

==History==
In its beginning Texas was populated by numerous [[Tribe (Native American)|native tribes]] before the first European explorers arrived. The Spanish were the first Europeans to visit the region in the 16th and 17th centuries. Since then Texas had continuously been a part of [[New Spain]].&lt;ref name="Atwood"&gt;Atwood, E. Bagby. ''The Regional Vocabulary of Texas''. Austin: University of Texas Press, 1962.&lt;/ref&gt; Except for the native languages Spanish was the first language spoken in Texas. After Mexico gained independence in 1821, Texas opened up to Anglo Settlements in the 1820s. Following the influx of English-speaking whites from the United States, English became as common as Spanish in [[Central Texas|central]] and [[Northern Texas|north Texas]] while South Texas remained largely Spanish speaking.

Due to the immigration of mainly [[Southern United States|southern states]] of the United States, the English language was mainly introduced from the old South.&lt;ref name="Walsh"&gt;Walsh, Harry, and Victor L. Mote. "A Texas Dialect Feature: Origins and Distribution." ''American Speech'', 49.1-2 (1974). 40-53.&lt;/ref&gt; Immigrants who migrated to the [[Eastern Texas|east]] and [[Southeast Texas|southeast]] parts of Texas included Anglos from the lower or coastal South states such as [[Alabama]], [[Mississippi]], and [[Louisiana]] whereas Anglos from the Upper South ([[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]], [[Tennessee]], [[Kentucky]], [[Virginia]], [[the Carolinas]], [[Missouri]], and [[Arkansas]]) dominated most of northern and central Texas.&lt;ref name="Wolfram 3"/&gt; The immigration from the lower and coastal South to southern Texas can be proven by the 1850 census returns of [[Jefferson County, Texas|Jefferson County]], located in southeastern Texas. In this census citizens of Jefferson County named their origin among other things. The 1850 census returns of [[Grayson County, Texas|Grayson County]] which is located in the northeast of Texas proved that immigrants who moved to this area mainly came from the Upper South.&lt;ref name="Walsh"/&gt; Any attempt to make an assumption of the immigration to West Texas is not possible due to the lack of information in the 1860 census concerning the origin of immigrants. However, after a military campaign against the [[Native Americans in the United States|Indians]] in 1875 the number of immigrants in West Texas grew rapidly.&lt;ref name="Walsh"/&gt; In 1896 400,000 persons moved to north-central Texas, half of which came from northern Arkansas, and Tennessee.

After the [[Texas Revolution]] Texas became an independent republic in 1836. As a result, Anglos outnumbered Hispanics&lt;ref name="Texan English"&gt;[https://www.pbs.org/speak/seatosea/americanvarieties/texan/ "Texas English."] ''Do you speak American?''. 6 Sept 2012&lt;/ref&gt; and English became the predominant language in Texas. However, Spanish did not simply disappear but was united with the language and culture of the new settlers making a new kind of dialect.&lt;ref name="Texan English"/&gt; Nevertheless, the formation of what we call Texan English was not finished until the 19th century when immigrants from Europe came in great numbers to Texas.&lt;ref name="Texan English"/&gt; The language they brought with them strongly influenced general English as well as Texan English. The migration from Europe to Texas or the USA in general continued in the 20th century and was increased by other immigrants from all over the world, especially from Mexico.&lt;ref name="Wolfram 3"/&gt; In the beginning of the 20th century after the Mexican Revolution of 1910-1920 there was a great number of Mexicans which immigrated to Texas.&lt;ref name="Wolfram 3"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Atwood"/&gt; This then slowed down in the mid of the 20th century only to increase massively since 1990.&lt;ref name="Texan English"/&gt; Due to the large number of Mexican immigrants Spanish will continue to have a great influence on the Texan dialect of English.

The history of immigration not only made English the predominant language, but also led to a difference between the pronunciation in West Texas and East Texas. This difference can be easily explained by the migration history of Texas in which different states of the United States and different countries of Europe settled in certain areas, thus "creating a dialectal zone of transition between East and West Texas".&lt;ref name="Walsh"/&gt; 
Texas had a unique history, an individual migration process, and an existence as an independent Republic. All these factors contributed to form Texan English.

==Texan English in the media==

Texan English frequently shows up in the media. In the 1950s and 1960s many [[Hollywood]] [[western movies]] like [[Giant (1956 film)|''Giant'']], [[Hud (1963 film)|''Hud'']], and [[The Alamo (1960 film)|''The Alamo'']] were set in Texas. In those movies the Texan dialect took a big part. In fact, Hollywood stars like [[James Dean]], [[Rock Hudson]], [[Dennis Hopper]], [[Paul Newman]], and [[Patricia Neal]] first had to learn how to speak Texan English and were instructed by native Texans. Also the famous TV series ''[[Dallas (1978 TV series)|''Dallas'']]'' was often characterized by Texan English.

[[Texas Instruments]] sometimes uses Texan English in its products. The TIFORM software for its [[TI-990]] minicomputer sometimes displayed "Shut 'er Down Clancey She's a-Pumping Mud". Its documentation defined the [[error message]] as "An error has occurred in the TIFORM Executor which is not identifiable. Please call the TI customer representative".&lt;ref name="lener19840403"&gt;{{cite web | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=e-gI2W-3JwkC&amp;lpg=PA385&amp;pg=PA49#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=true | title=TI Talks Texan | work=PC Magazine | date=1984-04-03 | accessdate=24 October 2013 | author=Lener, Jeffrey | page=49}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Texan accent gained nationwide fame with the presidency of native Texan [[Lyndon B. Johnson]]. A lifelong resident of the [[Texas Hill Country]], Johnson's thick accent was a large part of his personality and brought attention and fame to the dialect.&lt;ref name="Texan English"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Do you speak American"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pbs.org/speak/seatosea/americanvarieties/texan/|title=Do You Speak American . Sea to Shining Sea . American Varieties . Texan - PBS|website=www.pbs.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Texan dialect gained fame again when [[George W. Bush]] started to serve as president. The former President, who moved to [[West Texas]] at the age of two, always emphasized his connection to Texas by retaining his dialect during his time in office. His dialect was particularly heavy. Words like America sometimes sounded like "Amur-kah" or even just like "Mur-kah".&lt;ref name="Texan English"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Drawl or Nothin'"&gt;[https://www.pbs.org/speak/seatosea/americanvarieties/texan/drawl/ "Drawl or Nothin’"] ''Do you speak American?''. 6 Sept 2012&lt;/ref&gt; Former U.S. Secretary of State [[Rex Tillerson]] also speaks with a distinctively Texan accent.

==Languages spoken in Texas==
[[File:Languages spoken in Texas.png|thumb|Languages spoken in Texas]]

Although the state of Texas does not have an official language, the majority of all Texans speak English. Because of the large number of Spanish-speaking immigrants from Mexico, Spanish is the second most widespread language. 
About 14 million Texan residents speak exclusively English, which is around two-thirds of the people over five years old in Texas. Due to thousands of Mexican immigrants, around 6 million  (ca. 29%) people in Texas speak Spanish as the first language.&lt;ref name="MLA"&gt;Feal, Rosemary G., ed. [http://www.mla.org/map_data_results&amp;SRVY_YEAR=2005&amp;geo=state&amp;state_id=48&amp;mode=geographic "MLA Language Map Data Center."] Modern English Association. 4 Sept 2012&lt;/ref&gt;
Recent data shows that Spanish is still increasing.&lt;ref name="MLA2"&gt;Feal, Rosemary G., ed. [http://www.mla.org/cgi-shl/docstudio/docs.pl?map_data_results "MLA Language Map Data Center."] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060619224705/http://www.mla.org/cgi-shl/docstudio/docs.pl?map_data_results |date=2006-06-19 }} Modern English Association. 4 Sept 2012&lt;/ref&gt; Since there are so many Spanish speakers in Texas, Spanish has a high impact on the [[English dialects|English dialect]] spoken in Texas.&lt;ref name="MLA3"&gt;[http://www.mla.org/map_data_results&amp;SRVY_YEAR=2005&amp;geo=state&amp;state_id=48&amp;mode=geographic "MLA Language Map Data Center."] Modern English Association. Ed. Rosemary G. Feal. 4 Sept 2012&lt;/ref&gt; For instance, many Texan English words are derived or adopted from Spanish. Many [[Mexican Americans]] in Texas speak their own variety of English which has many Spanish features (terms, phonology, etc.). This dialect is called [[Tejano]] English (TE) and is mostly spoken by working-class Mexican Americans.  A very distinctive feature of that dialect is the /-t,d/-deletion in words which contain a /t/ or /d/ in the final position.&lt;ref name="Bayley"&gt;Bayley, Robert. "Variation in Tejano English: Evidence for Variable Lexical Phonology." ''Language Variety in the South''. eds. Cynthia Berstein et al. Tuscaloosa: The University of Alabama Press, 1997. 197-210.&lt;/ref&gt;  In addition to Spanish, there are several other non-English languages, but compared to Spanish they are not very common (see table).

{{nihongo|'''"The Nose"'''|鼻|Hana}} is a satirical [[short story]] by [[Akutagawa Ryūnosuke]] based on a thirteenth-century [[Japan]]ese tale from the ''[[Uji Shūi Monogatari]]''.&lt;ref name=ideology/&gt;&lt;ref name=dawn&gt;Keene, Donald. Dawn to the West. New York: Columbia UP, 1998.&lt;/ref&gt; "The Nose" was Akutagawa’s second short story, written not long after "[[Rashōmon (short story)|Rashōmon]]". It was first published in January [[1916 in literature|1916]]&lt;ref&gt;Rimer, J. Thomas, and Van C. Gessel. The Columbia Anthology of Modern Japanese Literature. New York: Columbia UP, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt; in the [[Tokyo Imperial University]] student magazine Shinshichō&lt;ref name=jlit/&gt; and later published in other magazines and various Akutagawa [[anthology|anthologies]]. The story is mainly a commentary on vanity and religion, in a style and theme typical to Akutagawa’s work.

==Translation==
Multiple translators have published "The Nose" in English, the most recent by [[Jay Rubin]] and published by [[Penguin Group]].

==Plot summary==
Zenchi Naigu,  a [[Heian period]] [[Buddhist priest]], is more concerned with diminishing his overly long, dangling nose than he is with studying and teaching the [[sūtra]]s.&lt;ref name=story&gt;
Akutagawa, Ryūnosuke. "The Nose." 1916. Rashōmon and 17 Other Stories. Trans. Jay Rubin. New York City: Penguin Group, 2006. 3-9.&lt;/ref&gt; He pretends to ignore his nose in fear it will be mentioned, and studies religious texts in a desperate attempt to find a person with a nose like his. When in private, he constantly checks his nose in a mirror, hoping for even the smallest amount of shrinkage.

One autumn, a disciple reveals he has learned a new technique to shrink noses from a friend, a [[Traditional Chinese medicine|Chinese doctor]] who has become a high-ranking priest at the [[Chōraku-ji|Chōrakuji temple]] in [[Kyoto]]. At first, Naigu feigns disinterest, to appeal to the misconception that he is unconcerned with his nose,&lt;ref name=story/&gt; but eventually “gives in” to his disciple’s insisting.&lt;ref name=story/&gt; The disciple first boils the nose, then stomps on it, finally removing the beads of fat the treatment extracts from the nose. To Naigu’s satisfaction, the nose, once dangling past his chin, is now the size of a typical hooked nose.&lt;ref name=dawn/&gt;

Naigu, excited but nervous, sets about his weekly routines. He is surprised, however, to find the people he encounters laughing at him far more openly than they had before. Naigu becomes bitter and harsh, to the point where one disciple proclaims: “Naigu will be punished for treating us so harshly instead of teaching us Buddha’s Law”.&lt;ref name=story/&gt; People continue to laugh at Naigu for his vanity, until one day, Naigu wakes up, and to his relief and rejoicing, his nose has returned to its original length.

==Characters==
;Naigu
::A Buddhist priest ascribed the “wisdom of zen”, his life is consumed with an obsession over his nose, which dangles past his mouth at about five or six inches.&lt;ref name=ideology/&gt; He looks through the scriptures to find reference of others with his peculiar predicament, but achieves no success. When he finds a method to shorten his nose, he becomes flippant when people laugh at his vanity. Eventually, when his nose grows back, he rejoices in his condition.
;Disciple
::A follower of Naigu who informs his master of a method to shorten his nose. He later joins the others in his criticism of Naigu, upset that Naigu is more interested in his vanity than in teaching the scriptures.

==Major themes==
Akutagawa explores the themes of vanity and egoism in "The Nose".&lt;ref name=jlit/&gt;&lt;ref name=enotes&gt;"Ryunosuke, Akutagawa: Introduction." Short Story Criticism. Ed. Justin Karr Editor. Vol. 44. Gale Cengage, 2001. eNotes.com. 2006. 27 Sep, 2008 &lt;http://www.enotes.com/short-story-criticism/ryunosuke-akutagawa&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Naigu’s vanity leads him to obsess only with his nose. This vanity eventually breeds disfigurement and a coldness from his peers,&lt;ref name=enotes/&gt; recognizing Naigu’s egotism taking precedence over his religious studies and teaching. Instead of his status as a renowned priest, Naigu views his nose as the source of how society will judge him. As is typical with Akutagawa, these inherently modern psychological themes are directly injected into ancient stories and myth.&lt;ref name=world&gt;"Ryunosuke Akutagawa Biography." Encyclopedia of World Biography. 27 Sept. 2008 &lt;http://www.bookrags.com/biography/ryunosuke-akutagawa/&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Literary significance and reception==
Akutagawa gained much of his initial fame from "The Nose", one of his earliest works.&lt;ref name=calendar&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.kirjasto.sci.fi/akuta.htm |title=Akutagawa Ryunosuke |website=Books and Writers ''(kirjasto.sci.fi)'' |first=Petri |last=Liukkonen |publisher=[[Kuusankoski]] Public Library |location=Finland |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080516015758/http://www.kirjasto.sci.fi/akuta.htm |archivedate=16 May 2008 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=ideology/&gt;

After reading "The Nose", the renowned writer [[Natsume Sōseki]] sent a letter to Akutagawa, praising his work:&lt;ref name=dawn/&gt;
	&lt;blockquote&gt;I found your piece ["The Nose"] very interesting. Sober and serious without trying to be funny. It exudes humor, a sure sign of refined taste. Furthermore, the material is fresh and eye-catching. Your style is well-published, admirably fitting.&lt;ref name=ideology&gt;Murakami, Fuminobu. Ideology and Narrative in Modern Japanese Literature. Assen, Netherlands: Uitgeverij Van Gorcum, 1996.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===References to other works===
The story makes numerous references to the Buddhist scriptures, mentioning many characters from them, such as [[Mokuren]], [[Sharihotsu]], [[Ryūju]], [[Memyō]], and the [[Bodhisattva]]s
It also makes reference to a Chinese story where the [[China|Chinese]] [[Shu Han]] emperor [[Liu Bei]] is said to have had long ears.

==References to actual geography==
The story makes reference to [[Chōraku-ji|Chōraku-ji Temple]], a Buddhist temple in [[Shimoda, Shizuoka]] where the story’s Chinese doctor formerly became a high-ranking priest.

"The Nose" also makes reference to the [[Kyoto Imperial Palace]], where Naigu is one of the few honored priests able to minister within the palace walls.

'''Timoclea''' or '''Timocleia of Thebes''' is a woman whose story is told by [[Plutarch]] in his ''Life of Alexander'', and at greater length in his ''Mulierum virtutes'' ("Virtues of Women").  According to Plutarch's biography of [[Alexander the Great]], when his forces took [[Ancient Thebes (Boeotia)|Thebes]] during [[Alexander's Balkan campaign]] of 335 BC, [[Thracian]] forces pillaged the city, and a captain of the Thracian forces [[rape]]d Timocleia.&lt;ref name="Alexander"&gt;[http://classics.mit.edu/Plutarch/alexandr.html Plutarch – Life of Alexander]&lt;/ref&gt;  After raping her, the captain asked if she knew of any hidden money.  She told him that she did, and led him into her garden, and told him there was money hidden in her [[Water well|well]].&lt;ref name="Alexander"/&gt;  When the Thracian captain stooped to look into the well, Timoclea pushed him into the well, and then hurled heavy stones into the well until the captain was dead.&lt;ref name="Alexander"/&gt;

Timoclea was seized by the Thracian soldiers and brought before Alexander the Great.  She comported herself with great dignity and told Alexander that her brother was Theagenes, last commander of the [[Theban Sacred Band]], who died "for the liberty of Greece" at the [[Battle of Chaeronea (338 BC)|Battle of Chaeronea]] in 338 BC, defeated by Alexander's father [[Philip of Macedon]].  Alexander was so impressed with Timocleia that he ordered her and her children released and she was not punished for killing the Thracian captain.&lt;ref name="Alexander"/&gt; 

The story in the ''Mulierum virtutes'' is essentially the same, except that the captain is told that the treasure, of silver bowls, gold and some money, was at the bottom of a dry well, which he climbs down into. When Timoclea hears that he has reached the bottom, she throws down rocks on him. Alexander dismisses her without punishment but does not set her or her family free. He instead tells his officers to take special care of them and other renowned families, making sure there is no more abuse.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=F9uCAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA71&amp;lpg=PA71 Excerpt in] ''Alexander the Great: A Reader'', Ian Worthington, ed, pp. 70–71, Routledge, {{ISBN|1134435924}}, 9781134435920; [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A2008.01.0208%3Achapter%3D24 Example 24 in the ''Mulierum virtutes'']&lt;/ref&gt;

Plutarch's main source for the incident, as he mentions in passing elsewhere, was the account by [[Aristobulus of Cassandreia]],&lt;ref&gt;Hammond, N. G. L., ''Sources for Alexander the Great: An Analysis of Plutarch's "Life" and Arrian's "Anabasis Alexandrou"'', pp. 154–155, 2007, Cambridge University Press, {{ISBN|0521714710}}, 9780521714716[https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=gay_i14p9oEC&amp;pg=PA154 google books]&lt;/ref&gt; who knew Alexander well; this survives only in quotations by others, which may not all be accurate.  The taking of Thebes took place in the second year of Alexander's reign, and was otherwise a very bloody affair, as the city was the leader in a Greek revolt, taking advantage of Philip's assassination, against the treaties he had enforced.  Perhaps 6,000 Thebans died, and 30,000 were enslaved, and the city virtually ceased to exist for some decades.  The only other act of clemency recorded is that Alexander ordered the house and descendants of the poet [[Pindar]] (died c. 443 BC) to be left alone.&lt;ref&gt;Martin, Thomas R., Blackwell, Christopher W., ''Alexander the Great: The Story of an Ancient Life'', pp. 48–50, 2012, Cambridge University Press, {{ISBN|1139576534}}, 9781139576536, [https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=4_MgAwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA50 google books]&lt;/ref&gt; 

==In later art==
[[File:Davent bm 5.jpg|thumb|[[Léon Davent]], Etching, c.1541/45, after [[Francesco Primaticcio]].  341 x 231 mm.]]
Timoclea was a rare subject in art from the Renaissance onwards, never becoming a regular subject in the range of incidents showing classical and biblical female violence against men known as the [[Power of Women]] [[literary topos|topos]].  But she featured in cycles on the ''Life of Alexander'', and there was an increasing tendency in court art to depict Alexander as a proxy for the actual monarch, and to emphasize acts of generosity or mercy.&lt;ref&gt;Aghion I., Barbillon C., Lissarrague, F., ''Gods and Heroes of Classical Antiquity'', Flammarion Iconographic Guides, pp. 30–31, 1996, {{ISBN|2080135805}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Most depictions show her brought before Alexander, which might form part of a cycle illustrating his life.&lt;ref&gt;Hall, 12&lt;/ref&gt;  This was the case in the cycle of [[fresco]]s painted in the [[Palace of Fontainebleau]] in the 1540s by [[Francesco Primaticcio]] and his team.  This was in the bedroom of [[Francis I of France|Francois I's]] mistress, [[Anne de Pisseleu d'Heilly|the Duchess of Étampes]] (1508–1580), and a total of eleven compositions surviving today are known from surviving paintings or prints or drawings.  The cycle showed the life of Alexander, but with little emphasis on his military career. This was one of the three subjects from the cycle [[etching|etched]] as a print by [[Léon Davent]].&lt;ref&gt;Boorsch, Suzanne, in: Jacobson, Karen (ed), (often wrongly cat. as [[George Baselitz]]), ''The French Renaissance in Prints'', pp. 256–257, 1994, Grunwald Center, UCLA, {{ISBN|0962816221}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Unusually in this subject, but rather typically for the First [[School of Fontainebleau]], Timoclea is naked when brought to Alexander. 

Here and in other depictions, the subject was given a composition similar to ones of the much more common ''[[The Continence of Scipio]]''; the subject likewise emphasized the magnamimity of the commander.  Timoclea sometimes accompanied the ''Continence'' in a series,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sothebys.com/en/auctions/ecatalogue/2010/important-old-master-paintings-and-sculpture-n08610/lot.177.html "Giovanni Battista Gaulli, called Il Baciccio ''The Continence of Scipio''], [[Sotheby's]]&lt;/ref&gt; and is also capable of being confused with it.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.britishmuseum.org/research/collection_online/collection_object_details.aspx?objectId=715754&amp;partId=1 British Museum, Drawing Cat. 1860,0616.118], by [[Perino del Vaga]]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Bernard de Montfaucon]] paired the two stories as his "Examples of the clemency and continence of conquerors" in a book of 1724.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=-b_ojfBm3EQC&amp;pg=PT122&amp;lpg=PT122 ''Supplement au livre de l'antiquité expliquée et représentée en figures: tome quatrième: qui comprend la guerre, les ponts, les aqueducs, la navigation, les phares &amp; les tours octogones''], Chapter 4&lt;/ref&gt;

As the ''Life of Alexander'' was a popular subject, the story of Timoclea probably would have been more a popular element if there had not been a grander and less sordid competitor in the form of [[The Family of Darius before Alexander]], best known from [[The Family of Darius before Alexander|Veronese's painting in London]], which was normally included in cycles, and also showed Alexander being generous to women captives brought before him.&lt;ref&gt;Hall, 12&lt;/ref&gt; 

The most influential image of Timoclea's story, judging by copies in prints for two centuries after,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.britishmuseum.org/research/collection_online/search.aspx?searchText=timoclea British Museum search]&lt;/ref&gt; was the painting by [[Domenichino]] of c. 1615, which was in the French royal collection from the time of [[Louis XIV]], and then the [[Louvre]].  Unlike most depictions, this shows her children prominently.  A very different composition, showing only one and a half figures, with the Thracian disappearing upside down into the well, first appears in an [[engraving]] of 1629–30 by [[Matthäus Merian]], a book illustration for a popular German world history by [[Johann Ludwig Gottfried]].  This was later adapted in an oil painting by [[Elisabetta Sirani]].&lt;ref&gt;Golahny, Amy, [https://www.lycoming.edu/art/amy/Golahny-Timoclea-SOURCE-2011.pdf 1 "Elisabetta Sirani’s Timoclea and Visual Precedent", ''Source'', 30, 2011, 37–42 PDF]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Later literature==
A play, now lost, called ''Timoclea at the Siege of Thebes'' was performed at [[Hampton Court Palace]] before [[Elizabeth I of England|Elizabeth I]] and the English court at [[Candlemas]] 1574, on February 2 (this was five years before the influential English translation of Plutarch by [[Thomas North]] was published). The author is unknown, and the performers were boys from the [[Merchant Taylors' School, Northwood|Merchant Taylor's School, London]], directed by their master [[Richard Mulcaster]].&lt;ref name=lost&gt;[https://www.lostplays.org/lpd/Timoclea_at_the_Siege_of_Thebes Lost Plays Database], University of Melbourne, "Timoclea at the Siege of Thebes", Anon. (1574) &lt;/ref&gt;  They were one of a number of [[Boy player#Children's companies|companies of boy players]] active in [[English Renaissance theatre]] in London.  The performance and its expenses was recorded in the accounts of the [[Master of the Revels]], and from the number of children's gloves paid for may have included twenty four performers.  It may not have been a great success, as the [[masque]] prepared to follow it, with ladies "with lightes being vj vertues" was "not showen for the Tediusnesse of the playe that nighte."&lt;ref name=lost/&gt;

Timoclea also appears in ''Gynaikeion or Nine Books of Various History Concerning Women'' by [[Thomas Heywood]], 1624, and as a minor character in [[John Lyly]]'s play  ''[[Campaspe (play)|Campaspe]]'',&lt;ref name=lost/&gt; a comedy also performed by boy players.  According to this, Timoclea and [[Campaspe]] were both captives at Alexander's conquest of Thebes, and are brought together before Alexander, where Timoclea's aristocratic dignity contrasts with Campaspe's self-description as "a humble handmaid to Alexander".&lt;ref&gt;''"Campaspe" and "Sappho and Phao": John Lyly", ''The Revels Plays'', eds.

'''Truth''' is most often used to mean being in accord with [[fact]] or [[reality]], or fidelity to an original or standard.&lt;ref name = Merriam-Webster-def&gt;Merriam-Webster's Online Dictionary, [http://m-w.com/dictionary/truth truth], 2005&lt;/ref&gt; Truth is also sometimes defined in [[modernity|modern]] contexts as an idea of "truth to self", or [[authenticity (philosophy)|authenticity]].

Truth is usually held to be [[principle of bivalence|opposite]] to [[Falsity|falsehood]], which, correspondingly, can also suggest a logical, factual, or ethical meaning. The [[concept]] of truth is discussed and [[debate]]d in several contexts, including philosophy, art, theology, and science. Most human activities depend upon the concept, where its nature as a concept is assumed rather than being a subject of discussion; these include most of the [[science]]s, [[law]], [[journalism]], and everyday life. Some philosophers view the concept of truth as basic, and unable to be explained in any terms that are more easily understood than the concept of truth itself. To some, truth is viewed as the correspondence of [[language]] or [[thought]] to an independent [[reality]], in what is sometimes called the [[correspondence theory of truth]].

Various theories and views of truth continue to be debated among scholars, philosophers, and theologians.&lt;ref name=PUP32014&gt;{{cite book|author1=Alexis G. Burgess and John P. Burgess|title=Truth|date=March 20, 2011|publisher=Princeton University Press|isbn=978-0691144016|edition=1st|url=http://press.princeton.edu/titles/9460.html|accessdate=October 4, 2014|format=hardcover|quote=a concise introduction to current philosophical debates about truth}}&lt;/ref&gt; Language is a means by which humans convey [[information]] to one another. The method used to determine whether something is a truth is termed a [[criteria of truth|criterion of truth]]. There are varying stances on such questions as what constitutes truth: what things are [[truthbearer]]s capable of being true or false; how to define, identify, and distinguish truth; what roles do faith and empirical knowledge play; and whether truth can be [[Subjectivity|subjective]] or is [[Objectivity (philosophy)|objective]]: [[knowledge relativity|relative]] truth versus [[Absolute (philosophy)|absolute]] truth.

[[File:An angel carrying the banner of "Truth", Roslin, Midlothian.JPG|thumb|left|An angel carrying the banner of "Truth", [[Roslin, Midlothian]]]]
The English word ''[[:wikt:truth|truth]]'' is derived from [[Old English]] ''tríewþ, tréowþ, trýwþ'', [[Middle English]] ''trewþe'', cognate to [[Old High German]] ''triuwida'', [[Old Norse]] ''tryggð''. Like ''[[Troth (disambiguation)|troth]]'', it is a ''[[:wikt:-th|-th]]'' nominalisation of the adjective ''true'' (Old English ''tréowe'').

The English word ''[[:wikt:true|true]]'' is from Old English ([[West Sexaon dialect (Old English)|West Saxon]]) ''(ge)tríewe, [[:wikt:treowe|tréowe]]'', cognate to [[Old Saxon]] ''(gi)trûui'', [[Old High German]] ''(ga)triuwu'' ([[Modern German]] ''treu'' "faithful"), [[Old Norse]] ''tryggr'', [[Gothic language|Gothic]] ''triggws'',&lt;ref&gt;see [[Holtzmann's law]] for the ''-ww-'' : ''-gg-'' alternation.&lt;/ref&gt; all from a [[Proto-Germanic]] ''*trewwj-'' "having [[good faith]]", perhaps ultimately from PIE *dru- "tree", on the notion of "steadfast as an oak" (e.g., Sanskrit "taru" tree).&lt;ref name="Truth from Online Etymology"&gt;{{cite web|last=Etymology|first=Online|title=Online Etymology|url=http://www.etymonline.com/}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Old Norse ''{{lang|is|trú}}'', "faith, word of honour; religious faith, belief"&lt;ref&gt;''[http://www.northvegr.org/zoega/h442.php A Concise Dictionary of Old Icelandic]'', Geir T. Zoëga (1910), Northvegr.org&lt;/ref&gt; (archaic English ''[[:wikt:troth|troth]]'' "loyalty, honesty, good faith", compare ''{{lang|is|[[wikt:Ásatrú|Ásatrú]]}}'').

Thus, 'truth' involves both the quality of "faithfulness, fidelity, loyalty, sincerity, veracity",&lt;ref&gt;[[OED]] on ''true'' has "Steadfast in adherence to a commander or friend, to a principle or cause, to one's promises, faith, etc.; firm in allegiance; faithful, loyal, constant, trusty; Honest, honourable, upright, virtuous, trustworthy; free from deceit, sincere, truthful " besides "Conformity with fact; agreement with reality; accuracy, correctness, verity; Consistent with fact; agreeing with the reality; representing the thing as it is; Real, genuine; rightly answering to the description; properly so called; not counterfeit, spurious, or imaginary."&lt;/ref&gt; and that of "agreement with [[fact]] or [[reality]]", in Anglo-Saxon expressed by ''[[:wikt:sōþ|sōþ]]'' (Modern English ''[[:wikt:sooth|sooth]]'').

All Germanic languages besides English have introduced a terminological distinction between truth "fidelity" and truth "factuality". To express "factuality", [[North Germanic languages|North Germanic]] opted for nouns derived from ''sanna'' "to assert, affirm", while continental [[West Germanic languages|West Germanic]] (German and Dutch) opted for continuations of ''wâra'' "faith, trust, pact" (cognate to Slavic ''věra'' "(religious) faith", but influenced by Latin ''[[veritas|verus]]''). [[Romance language]]s use terms following the Latin ''[[veritas]]'', while the Greek ''[[aletheia]]'', Russian ''[[:wikt:pravda|pravda]]'' and South Slavic ''istina'' have separate etymological origins.

The question of what is a proper basis for deciding how words, symbols, ideas and beliefs may properly be considered true, whether by a single person or an entire society, is dealt with by the five most prevalent substantive theories of truth listed below. Each presents perspectives that are widely shared by published scholars.&lt;ref name="EPT"&gt;[[Encyclopedia of Philosophy]], Supp., "Truth", auth: Michael Williams, pp. 572–73 (Macmillan, 1996)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Blackburn, Simon, and Simmons, Keith (eds., 1999), ''Truth'', Oxford University Press, Oxford, UK. Includes papers by James, Ramsey, Russell, Tarski, and more recent work.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | editor1-last = Hale | editor1-first = Bob| editor2-first = Crispin | doi = 10.1111/b.9780631213260.1999.00015.x | pages = 309–30 | year = 1999 | isbn = 9780631213260 | pmid =  | pmc = | editor2-last = Wright | title = A Companion to the Philosophy of Language}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Theories other than the most prevalent substantive theories are also discussed. More recently developed "[[deflationary theory of truth|deflationary]]" or "minimalist" theories of truth have emerged as possible alternatives to the most prevalent substantive theories. Minimalist reasoning centres around the notion that the application of a term like ''true'' to a statement does not assert anything significant about it, for instance, anything about its ''nature''. Minimalist reasoning realises ''truth'' as a label utilised in general discourse to express agreement, to stress claims, or to form general assumptions.&lt;ref name = EPT/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Horwich, Paul, ''Truth'', (2nd edition, 1988),&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Field, Hartry, ''Truth and the Absence of Fact'' (2001).&lt;/ref&gt;

===Substantive theories===

====Correspondence theory====
{{Main|Correspondence theory of truth}}
Correspondence theories emphasise that true beliefs and true statements correspond to the actual state of affairs.&lt;ref&gt;[[Encyclopedia of Philosophy]], Vol.2, "Correspondence Theory of Truth", auth.: [[Arthur N. Prior]], p. 223 (Macmillan, 1969). Prior uses [[Bertrand Russell]]'s wording in defining correspondence theory. According to Prior, Russell was substantially responsible for helping to make correspondence theory widely known under this name.&lt;/ref&gt; This type of theory stresses a relationship between thoughts or statements on one hand, and things or objects on the other. It is a traditional model tracing its origins to [[ancient Greece|ancient Greek]] philosophers such as [[Socrates]], [[Plato]], and [[Aristotle]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Encyclopedia of Philosophy]], Vol.2, "Correspondence Theory of Truth", auth.: Arthur N. Prior, pp. 223–24 (Macmillan, 1969).&lt;/ref&gt; This class of theories holds that the truth or the falsity of a representation is determined in principle entirely by how it relates to "things", by whether it accurately describes those "things." A classic example of correspondence theory is the statement by the thirteenth century philosopher and theologian [[Thomas Aquinas]]: "[[Veritas est adaequatio rei et intellectus]]" ("Truth is the adequation of things and [[intellect]]"), which Aquinas attributed to the ninth century [[Neoplatonist]] [[Isaac Israeli ben Solomon|Isaac Israeli]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Encyclopedia of Philosophy]], Vol. 2, "Correspondence Theory of Truth", auth.: Arthur N. Prior, Macmillan, 1969, p. 224.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/truth-correspondence "Correspondence Theory of Truth", in Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Thomas Aquinas, ''[[Summa Theologiae]]'', I. Q.16, A.2 arg. 2.&lt;/ref&gt; Aquinas also restated the theory as: "A judgment is said to be true when it conforms to the external reality".&lt;ref&gt;[http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/truth-correspondence "Correspondence Theory of Truth", in Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy] (citing ''De Veritate'' Q.1, A.1–3 and ''[[Summa Theologiae]]'', I. Q.16).&lt;/ref&gt;

Correspondence theory centres heavily around the assumption that truth is a matter of accurately copying what is known as "[[objective reality]]" and then representing it in thoughts, words and other symbols.&lt;ref&gt;''See, e.g.,'' Bradley, F.H., "On Truth and Copying", in Blackburn, ''et al.'' (eds., 1999),''Truth'', 31–45.&lt;/ref&gt; Many modern theorists have stated that this ideal cannot be achieved without analysing additional factors.&lt;ref name=EPT/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Encyclopedia of Philosophy]], Vol.2, "Correspondence Theory of Truth", auth: Arthur N. Prior, pp. 223 ''ff''. Macmillan, 1969. See especially, section on "Moore's Correspondence Theory", 225–26, "Russell's Correspondence Theory", 226–27, "Remsey and Later Wittgenstein", 228–29, "Tarski's Semantic Theory", 230–31.&lt;/ref&gt; For example, language plays a role in that all languages have words to represent concepts that are virtually undefined in other languages. The [[German language|German]] word ''[[Zeitgeist]]'' is one such example: one who speaks or understands the language may "know" what it means, but any translation of the word apparently fails to accurately capture its full meaning (this is a problem with many abstract words, especially those derived in [[agglutinative languages]]). Thus, some words add an additional parameter to the construction of an accurate [[truth predicate]]. Among the philosophers who grappled with this problem is [[Alfred Tarski]], whose [[semantic theory of truth|semantic theory]] is summarized further below in this article.&lt;ref&gt;[[Encyclopedia of Philosophy]], Vol.2, "Correspondence Theory of Truth", auth: Arthur N. Prior, pp. 223 ''ff''. Macmillan, 1969. See the section on "Tarski's Semantic Theory", 230–31.&lt;/ref&gt;

Proponents of several of the theories below have gone further to assert that there are yet other issues necessary to the analysis, such as interpersonal power struggles, community interactions, personal biases and other factors involved in deciding what is seen as truth.

====Coherence theory====
{{Main|Coherence theory of truth}}
[[File:Statue of Truth.jpg|thumb|left|[[Walter Seymour Allward]]'s ''Veritas'' (Truth) outside [[Supreme Court of Canada]], [[Ottawa, Ontario]] [[Canada]]]]

For coherence theories in general, truth requires a proper fit of elements within a whole system. Very often, though, coherence is taken to imply something more than simple logical consistency; often there is a demand that the propositions in a coherent system lend mutual inferential support to each other. So, for example, the completeness and comprehensiveness of the underlying set of concepts is a critical factor in judging the validity and usefulness of a coherent system.&lt;ref&gt;[[Immanuel Kant]], for instance, assembled a controversial but quite coherent system in the early 19th century, whose validity and usefulness continues to be debated even today. Similarly, the systems of [[Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz|Leibniz]] and [[Spinoza]] are characteristic systems that are internally coherent but controversial in terms of their utility and validity.&lt;/ref&gt;  A pervasive tenet of coherence theories is the idea that truth is primarily a property of whole systems of propositions, and can be ascribed to individual propositions only according to their coherence with the whole.  Among the assortment of perspectives commonly regarded as coherence theory, theorists differ on the question of whether coherence entails many possible true systems of thought or only a single absolute system.

Some variants of coherence theory are claimed to describe the essential and intrinsic properties of [[formal system]]s in logic and mathematics.&lt;ref&gt;[[Encyclopedia of Philosophy]], Vol.2, "Coherence Theory of Truth", auth: Alan R. White, pp. 130–31 (Macmillan, 1969)&lt;/ref&gt;  However, formal reasoners are content to contemplate [[independence (mathematical logic)|axiomatically independent]] and sometimes mutually contradictory systems side by side, for example, the various [[noneuclidean geometry|alternative geometries]]. On the whole, coherence theories have been rejected for lacking justification in their application to other areas of truth, especially with respect to assertions about the [[Natural environment|natural world]], [[empirical]] data in general, assertions about practical matters of psychology and society, especially when used without support from the other major theories of truth.&lt;ref&gt;[[Encyclopedia of Philosophy]], Vol.2, "Coherence Theory of Truth", auth: Alan R. White, pp. 131–33, ''see'' esp., section on "Epistemological assumptions" (Macmillan, 1969)&lt;/ref&gt;

Coherence theories distinguish the thought of [[rationalism|rationalist]] philosophers, particularly of [[Spinoza]], [[Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz|Leibniz]], and [[G.W.F. Hegel]], along with the British philosopher [[F.H. Bradley]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Encyclopedia of Philosophy]], Vol.2, "Coherence Theory of Truth", auth: Alan R. White, p. 130&lt;/ref&gt;  They have found a resurgence also among several proponents of [[logical positivism]], notably [[Otto Neurath]] and [[Carl Hempel]].

====Constructivist theory====
{{Main|Constructivist epistemology}}

[[Constructivist epistemology|Social constructivism]] holds that truth is constructed by social processes, is historically and culturally specific, and that it is in part shaped through the power struggles within a community. Constructivism views all of our knowledge as "constructed," because it does not reflect any external "transcendent" realities (as a pure correspondence theory might hold).  Rather, perceptions of truth are viewed as contingent on convention, human perception, and social experience. It is believed by constructivists that representations of physical and biological reality, including [[Race (classification of human beings)|race]], [[Human sexuality|sexuality]], and [[gender]], are socially constructed.

[[Giambattista Vico]] was among the first to claim that history and culture were man-made. Vico's [[epistemology|epistemological]] orientation gathers the most diverse rays and unfolds in one axiom—''verum ipsum factum''—"truth itself is constructed". [[Hegel]] and [[Marx]] were among the other early proponents of the premise that truth is, or can be, socially constructed. Marx, like many critical theorists who followed, did not reject the existence of objective truth but rather distinguished between true knowledge and knowledge that has been distorted through power or ideology. For Marx, scientific and true knowledge is "in accordance with the dialectical understanding of history" and ideological knowledge is "an epiphenomenal expression of the relation of material forces in a given economic arrangement".&lt;ref&gt;May, Todd, 1993, Between Genealogy and Epistemology: Psychology, politics in the thought of Michel Foucault' with reference to Althusser and Balibar, 1970&lt;/ref&gt;

====Consensus theory====
{{Main|Consensus theory of truth}}

[[Consensus theory of truth|Consensus theory]] holds that truth is whatever is agreed upon, or in some versions, might come to be agreed upon, by some specified group. Such a group might include all human beings, or a [[subset]] thereof consisting of more than one person.

Among the current advocates of consensus theory as a useful accounting of the concept of "truth" is the philosopher [[Jürgen Habermas]].&lt;ref&gt;''See, e.g.'', Habermas, Jürgen, ''Knowledge and Human Interests'' (English translation, 1972).&lt;/ref&gt; Habermas maintains that truth is what would be agreed upon in an [[ideal speech situation]].&lt;ref&gt;''See, e.g.'', Habermas, Jürgen, ''Knowledge and Human Interests'' (English translation, 1972), esp. Part III, pp. 187 ''ff''.&lt;/ref&gt; Among the current strong critics of consensus theory is the philosopher [[Nicholas Rescher]].&lt;ref&gt;Rescher, Nicholas, ''Pluralism: Against the Demand for Consensus'' (1995).&lt;/ref&gt;

In the Islamic tradition, this principle is exemplified by the [[hadith]] in which [[Muhammad]] states, "My [[ummah|community]] will never agree upon an error"&lt;ref&gt;Narrated by [http://sunnah.com/tirmidhi/33/10 al-Tirmidhi (4:2167)], ibn Majah (2:1303), Abu Dawood, and others with slightly different wordings.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Pragmatic theory====
{{Main|Pragmatic theory of truth}}

The three most influential forms of the ''pragmatic theory of truth'' were introduced around the turn of the 20th century by [[Charles Sanders Peirce]], [[William James]], and [[John Dewey]].  Although there are wide differences in viewpoint among these and other proponents of pragmatic theory, they hold in common that truth is verified and confirmed by the results of putting one's concepts into practice.&lt;ref&gt;[[Encyclopedia of Philosophy]], Vol. 5, "Pragmatic Theory of Truth", 427 (Macmillan, 1969).&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Charles Sanders Peirce|Peirce]] defines truth as follows:  "Truth is that concordance of an abstract statement with the ideal limit towards which endless investigation would tend to bring scientific belief, which concordance the abstract statement may possess by virtue of the confession of its inaccuracy and one-sidedness, and this confession is an essential ingredient of truth."&lt;ref name="Peirce Truth and Falsity"&gt;Peirce, C.S. (1901), "Truth and Falsity and Error" (in part), pp. 716–20 in [[James Mark Baldwin]], ed., ''Dictionary of Philosophy and Psychology'', v. 2. Peirce's section is entitled "''Logical''", beginning on p. 718, column 1, and ending on p. 720 with the initials "(C.S.P.)", see Google Books [https://books.google.com/books?id=Dc8YAAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA718 Eprint]. Reprinted, ''[[Charles Sanders Peirce bibliography#CP|Collected Papers]]'' v. 5, pp. 565–73.&lt;/ref&gt;  This statement stresses Peirce's view that ideas of approximation, incompleteness, and partiality, what he describes elsewhere as ''[[fallibilism]]'' and "reference to the future", are essential to a proper conception of truth.  Although Peirce uses words like ''concordance'' and ''correspondence'' to describe one aspect of the pragmatic [[sign relation]], he is also quite explicit in saying that definitions of truth based on mere correspondence are no more than ''nominal'' definitions, which he accords a lower status than ''real'' definitions.

[[William James]]'s version of pragmatic theory, while complex, is often summarized by his statement that "the 'true' is only the expedient in our way of thinking, just as the 'right' is only the expedient in our way of behaving."&lt;ref name=WJP&gt;James, William, ''The Meaning of Truth, A Sequel to 'Pragmatism','' (1909).&lt;/ref&gt;  By this, James meant that truth is a ''quality'', the value of which is confirmed by its effectiveness when applying concepts to practice (thus, "pragmatic").

[[John Dewey]], less broadly than James but more broadly than Peirce, held that [[inquiry]], whether scientific, technical, sociological, philosophical or cultural, is self-corrective over time ''if''  openly submitted for testing by a community of inquirers in order to clarify, justify, refine and/or refute proposed truths.&lt;ref&gt;[[Encyclopedia of Philosophy]], Vol.2, "Dewey, John", auth [[Richard J. Bernstein]], p. 383 (Macmillan, 1969)&lt;/ref&gt;

Though not widely known, a new variation of the pragmatic theory was defined and wielded successfully from the 20th century forward. Defined and named by [[William Ernest Hocking]], this variation is known as "negative pragmatism".  Essentially, what works may or may not be true, but what fails cannot be true because the truth always works.&lt;ref&gt;Sahakian, W.S. &amp; Sahakian, M.L., Ideas of the Great Philosophers, New York: Barnes &amp; Noble, 1966, {{LCCN|66-23155}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Richard Feynman]] also ascribed to it: "We never are definitely right, we can only be sure we are wrong."&lt;ref name="FeynmanThe"&gt;Feynman, The Character of Physical Law, New York: Random House, 1994, {{ISBN|0-679-60127-9}}.&lt;/ref&gt; This approach incorporates many of the ideas from Peirce, James, and Dewey.  For Peirce, the idea of "... endless investigation would tend to bring about scientific belief ..." fits negative pragmatism in that a negative pragmatist would never stop testing.  As Feynman noted, an idea or theory "... could never be proved right, because tomorrow's experiment might succeed in proving wrong what you thought was right."&lt;ref name="FeynmanThe" /&gt;  Similarly, James and Dewey's ideas also ascribe truth to repeated testing which is "self-corrective" over time.

Pragmatism and negative pragmatism are also closely aligned with the [[coherence theory of truth]] in that any testing should not be isolated but rather incorporate knowledge from all human endeavors and experience.  The universe is a whole and integrated system, and testing should acknowledge and account for its diversity.  As Feynman said, "... if it disagrees with experiment, it is wrong."&lt;ref&gt;Feynman, ''The Character of Physical Law'', p. 150.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Minimalist (deflationary) theories===
{{Main|Deflationary theory of truth}}

Modern developments in the field of philosophy, starting with the relatively modern notion that a theory being old does not necessarily imply that it is completely flawless, have resulted in the rise of a new thesis: that the term ''truth'' does not denote a real property of sentences or propositions. This thesis is in part a response to the common use of ''truth predicates'' (e.g., that some particular thing "...is true") which was particularly prevalent in philosophical discourse on truth in the first half of the 20th century.  From this point of view, to assert that "'2 + 2 = 4' is true" is logically equivalent to asserting that "2 + 2 = 4", and the phrase "is true" is completely dispensable in this and every other context. In common parlance, truth predicates are not commonly heard, and it would be interpreted as an unusual occurrence were someone to utilise a truth predicate in an everyday conversation when asserting that something is true. Newer perspectives that take this discrepancy into account and work with sentence structures that are actually employed in common discourse can be broadly described:
* as ''deflationary'' theories of truth, since they attempt to deflate the presumed importance of the words "true" or ''truth'',
* as ''disquotational'' theories, to draw attention to the disappearance of the quotation marks in cases like the above example, or
* as ''minimalist'' theories of truth.&lt;ref name=EPT/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Blackburn, Simon, and Simmons, Keith (eds., 1999), ''Truth'' in the Introductory section of the book.&lt;/ref&gt;

Whichever term is used, deflationary theories can be said to hold in common that "[t]he predicate 'true' is an expressive convenience, not the name of a property requiring deep analysis."&lt;ref name=EPT/&gt; Once we have identified the truth predicate's formal features and utility, deflationists argue, we have said all there is to be said about truth. Among the theoretical concerns of these views is to explain away those special cases where it ''does'' appear that the concept of truth has peculiar and interesting properties. (See, e.g., [[Semantic paradox]]es, and below.)

In addition to highlighting such formal aspects of the predicate "is true", some deflationists point out that the concept enables us to express things that might otherwise require infinitely long sentences. For example, one cannot express confidence in Michael's accuracy by asserting the endless sentence:
:''Michael says, 'snow is white' and snow is white, or he says 'roses are red' and roses are red or he says ... etc.''
This assertion can also be succinctly expressed by saying: ''What Michael says is true''.&lt;ref&gt;[[Richard Kirkham]], [[Theories of Truth: A Critical Introduction]], MIT Press, 1992.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Performative theory of truth====
Attributed to [[P. F. Strawson]] is the performative theory of truth which holds that to say "'Snow is white' is true" is to perform the [[speech act]] of signaling one's agreement with the claim that snow is white (much like nodding one's head in agreement). The idea that some statements are more actions than communicative statements is not as odd as it may seem. Consider, for example, that when the bride says "I do" at the appropriate time in a wedding, she is performing the act of taking this man to be her lawful wedded husband. She is not ''describing'' herself as taking this man, but actually doing so (perhaps the most thorough analysis of such "illocutionary acts" is [[J. L. Austin]], "[[How to Do Things With Words]]"&lt;ref&gt;J. L. Austin, "How to Do Things With Words". Cambridge: Harvard University Press, 1975&lt;/ref&gt;).

Strawson holds that a similar analysis is applicable to all speech acts, not just illocutionary ones: "To say a statement is true is not to make a statement about a statement, but rather to perform the act of agreeing with, accepting, or endorsing a statement.  When one says 'It's true that it's raining,' one asserts no more than 'It's raining.'  The function of [the statement] 'It's true that...' is to agree with, accept, or endorse the statement that 'it's raining.'"&lt;ref&gt;[[Encyclopedia of Philosophy]], Vol. 6: ''Performative Theory of Truth'', auth: Gertrude Ezorsky, p. 88 (Macmillan, 1969)&lt;/ref&gt;

====Redundancy and related theories====
{{Main|Redundancy theory of truth}}

According to the [[redundancy theory of truth]], asserting that a statement is true is completely equivalent to asserting the statement itself.  For example, making the assertion that "&amp;nbsp;'Snow is white' is true" is equivalent to asserting "Snow is white".  Redundancy theorists infer from this premise that truth is a redundant concept; that is, it is merely a word that is traditionally used in conversation or writing, generally for emphasis, but not a word that actually equates to anything in reality.  This theory is commonly attributed to [[Frank P. Ramsey]], who held that the use of words like ''fact'' and ''truth'' was nothing but a [[periphrasis|roundabout]] way of asserting a proposition, and that treating these words as separate problems in isolation from judgment was merely a "linguistic muddle".&lt;ref name="EPT"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ramsey, F.P. (1927), "Facts and Propositions", Aristotelian Society Supplementary Volume 7, 153–70. Reprinted, pp. 34–51 in F.P. Ramsey, Philosophical Papers, David Hugh Mellor (ed.), Cambridge University Press, Cambridge, UK, 1990&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Le Morvan, Pierre. (2004) "Ramsey on Truth and Truth on Ramsey", ''The British Journal for the History of Philosophy'' 12(4), pp. 705–18.&lt;/ref&gt;

A variant of redundancy theory is the disquotational theory which uses a modified form of [[Alfred Tarski|Tarski]]'s [[Truth#Semantic theory of truth|schema]]: To say that '"P" is true' is to say that P.  A version of this theory was defended by [[C. J. F. Williams]] in his book ''What is Truth?''.  Yet another version of deflationism is the prosentential theory of truth, first developed by Dorothy Grover, Joseph Camp, and [[Nuel Belnap]] as an elaboration of Ramsey's claims.  They argue that sentences like "That's true", when said in response to "It's raining", are [[prosentence]]s, expressions that merely repeat the content of other expressions.  In the same way that ''it'' means the same as ''my dog'' in the sentence ''My dog was hungry, so I fed it'', ''That's true'' is supposed to mean the same as ''It's raining''—if you say the latter and I then say the former.  These variations do not necessarily follow Ramsey in asserting that truth is ''not'' a property, but rather can be understood to say that, for instance, the assertion "P" may well involve a substantial truth, and the theorists in this case are minimizing only the redundancy or prosentence involved in the statement such as "that's true."&lt;ref name=EPT/&gt;

Deflationary principles do not apply to representations that are not analogous to sentences, and also do not apply to many other things that are commonly judged to be true or otherwise.  Consider the analogy between the sentence "Snow is white" and the character named Snow White, both of which can be true in some sense.  To a minimalist, saying "Snow is white is true" is the same as saying "Snow is white," but to say "Snow White is true" is ''not'' the same as saying "Snow White."

====Philosophical skepticism====
{{see also|Philosophical skepticism|Certainty}}

[[Philosophical skepticism]] is generally any questioning attitude or [[doubt]] towards one or more items of knowledge or belief which ascribe truth to their assertions and propositions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=R. H. |last=Popkin |title=The History of Skepticism from Erasmus to Descartes (rev. ed. 1968); C. L. Stough, Greek Skepticism (1969); M. Burnyeat, ed., The Skeptical Tradition (1983); B. Stroud, The Significance of Philosophical Skepticism (1984) |url=http://encyclopedia2.thefreedictionary.com/Skeptikoi |work=Encyclopedia2.thefreedictionary.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"Philosophical views are typically classed as skeptical when they involve advancing some degree of doubt regarding claims that are elsewhere taken for granted." [http://www.utm.edu/research/iep/s/skepcont.htm utm.edu]&lt;/ref&gt; It is often directed at domains, such as the [[supernatural]], morality ([[moral skepticism]]), religion (skepticism about the existence of God), or knowledge (skepticism about the possibility of knowledge, or of certainty).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = The Oxford Handbook of Skepticism|url = https://books.google.com/books?id=Ozv0lftrUeEC|publisher = Oxford University Press, US|year = 2008|isbn = 9780195183214|language = en|first = John|last = Greco|authorlink=John Greco (philosopher)}}&lt;/ref&gt; Formally, skepticism as a topic occurs in the context of philosophy, particularly [[epistemology]], although it can be applied to any topic such as politics, religion, and pseudoscience.

Philosophical skepticism comes in various forms. Radical forms of skepticism deny that knowledge or rational belief is possible and urge us to suspend judgment regarding ascription of truth on many or all controversial matters. More moderate forms of skepticism claim only that nothing can be known with certainty, or that we can know little or nothing about the "big questions" in life, such as whether God exists or whether there is an afterlife. [[Religious skepticism]] is "doubt concerning basic religious principles (such as immortality, providence, and revelation)".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Definition of SKEPTICISM|url = http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/skepticism|website = www.merriam-webster.com|access-date = 2016-02-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Scientific skepticism]] concerns testing beliefs for reliability, by subjecting them to [[wikt:systematic|systematic]] investigation using the [[scientific method]], to discover [[empirical evidence]] for them.

===Pluralist theories===
{{Main|Pluralist theories of truth}}
Several of the major theories of truth hold that there is a particular property the having of which makes a belief or proposition true. Pluralist theories of truth assert that there may be more than one property that makes propositions true: ethical propositions might be true by virtue of coherence. Propositions about the physical world might be true by corresponding to the objects and properties they are about.

Some of the pragmatic theories, such as those by [[Charles Sanders Peirce|Charles Peirce]] and [[William James]], included aspects of correspondence, coherence and constructivist theories.&lt;ref name="Peirce Truth and Falsity"/&gt;&lt;ref name=WJP/&gt; [[Crispin Wright]] argued in his 1992 book ''Truth and Objectivity'' that any predicate which satisfied certain platitudes about truth qualified as a truth predicate. In some discourses, Wright argued, the role of the truth predicate might be played by the notion of superassertibility.&lt;ref&gt;Truth and Objectivity, Cambridge, Massachusetts: Harvard University Press, 1992.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Michael Lynch (philosopher)|Michael Lynch]], in a 2009 book ''Truth as One and Many'', argued that we should see truth as a functional property capable of being multiply manifested in distinct properties like correspondence or coherence.&lt;ref&gt;Truth as One and Many (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2009).&lt;/ref&gt;

===Most believed theories===
According to a survey of professional philosophers and others on their philosophical views which was carried out in November 2009 (taken by 3226 respondents, including 1803 philosophy faculty members and/or PhDs and 829 philosophy graduate students) 45% of respondents accept or lean towards correspondence theories, 21% accept or lean towards deflationary theories and 14% [[Epistemic theories of truth|epistemic theories]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://philpapers.org/surveys/results.pl?affil=All+respondents&amp;areas0=0&amp;areas_max=1&amp;grain=medium |title=The PhilPapers Surveys – Preliminary Survey results |website=The PhilPapers Surveys |publisher=Philpapers.org |date= |accessdate=2012-05-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Formal theories==

===Truth in logic===
{{Main|Logical truth|Criteria of truth|Truth value}}

[[Logic]] is concerned with the patterns in [[reason]] that can help tell us if a [[proposition]] is true or not. However, logic does not deal with truth in the absolute sense, as for instance a [[metaphysics|metaphysician]] does. Logicians use [[formal language]]s to express the truths which they are concerned with, and as such there is only truth under some [[interpretation (logic)|interpretation]] or truth within some [[logical system]].

A logical truth (also called an analytic truth or a necessary truth) is a statement which is true in all possible worlds&lt;ref&gt;[[Ludwig Wittgenstein]], ''[[Tractatus Logico-Philosophicus]]''.&lt;/ref&gt; or under all possible interpretations, as contrasted to a ''[[fact]]'' (also called a ''[[Analytic-synthetic distinction|synthetic claim]]'' or a ''[[Necessary and sufficient condition|contingency]]'') which is only true in this [[World (philosophy)|world]] as it has historically unfolded. A proposition such as "If p and q, then p" is considered to be a logical truth because of the meaning of the [[symbol (formal)|symbols]] and [[well-formed formula|words]] in it and not because of any fact of any particular world. They are such that they could not be untrue.

[[Degree of truth|Degrees]] of [[truth values|truth]] in logic may be represented using two or more discrete values, as with [[principle of bivalence|bivalent logic]] (or [[Boolean logic|binary logic]]), [[three-valued logic]], and other forms of [[finite-valued logic]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last=Kretzmann| first=Norman| title=William of Sherwood's Treatise on Syncategorematic Words| chapter=IV, section&lt;nowiki&gt;=&lt;/nowiki&gt;2.

===Truth in mathematics===
{{Main|Model theory|Proof theory}}

There are two main approaches to truth in mathematics.  They are the ''[[model theory|model theory of truth]]'' and the ''[[proof theory|proof theory of truth]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Penelope Maddy; ''Realism in Mathematics''; Series: Clarendon Paperbacks; Paperback: 216 pages; Publisher: Oxford University Press, US (October 15, 1992); {{ISBN|019824035X}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Historically, with the nineteenth century development of [[Boolean algebra (logic)|Boolean algebra]] mathematical models of logic began to treat "truth", also represented as "T" or "1", as an arbitrary constant.  "Falsity" is also an arbitrary constant, which can be represented as "F" or "0".  In [[propositional logic]], these symbols can be manipulated according to a set of [[axioms]] and [[rules of inference]], often given in the form of [[truth table]]s.

In addition, from at least the time of [[Hilbert's program]] at the turn of the twentieth century to the proof of [[Gödel's incompleteness theorems]] and the development of the [[Church–Turing thesis]] in the early part of that century, true statements in mathematics were [[logical positivism|generally assumed]] to be those statements that are provable in a formal axiomatic system.&lt;ref&gt;Elliott Mendelson; ''Introduction to Mathematical Logic''; Series: Discrete Mathematics and Its Applications; Hardcover: 469 pages; Publisher: Chapman and Hall/CRC; 5 edition (August 11, 2009); {{ISBN|1584888768}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

The works of [[Kurt Gödel]], [[Alan Turing]], and others shook this assumption, with the development of statements that are true but cannot be proven within the system.&lt;ref&gt;''See, e.g.,'' Chaitin, Gregory L., ''The Limits of Mathematics'' (1997) esp. 89 ''ff''.&lt;/ref&gt; Two examples of the latter can be found in [[Hilbert's problems]]. Work on [[Hilbert's 10th problem]] led in the late twentieth century to the construction of specific [[Diophantine equations]] for which it is undecidable whether they have a solution,&lt;ref&gt;M. Davis. "Hilbert's Tenth Problem is Unsolvable." ''American Mathematical Monthly'' 80, pp. 233–69, 1973&lt;/ref&gt; or even if they do, whether they have a finite or infinite number of solutions. More fundamentally, [[Hilbert's first problem]] was on the [[continuum hypothesis]].&lt;ref&gt;Yandell, Benjamin H.. ''The Honors Class. Hilbert's Problems and Their Solvers'' (2002).&lt;/ref&gt; Gödel and [[Paul Cohen (mathematician)|Paul Cohen]] showed that this hypothesis cannot be proved or disproved using the standard [[axiom]]s of [[set theory]].&lt;ref&gt;Chaitin, Gregory L., ''The Limits of Mathematics'' (1997) 1–28, 89 ''ff''.&lt;/ref&gt; In the view of some, then, it is equally reasonable to take either the continuum hypothesis or its negation as a new axiom.

Reconsidered assumptions about the essence of truth arose in the wake of Gödel's incompleteness theorems. [[Martin Heidegger]] pointed out that truth may be essentially a matter of letting [[Being and Time|beings]] (entities of any kind, which can include logical propositions)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last=Heidegger| first=Martin| title=Being and Time| year=1927| url=http://pdf-objects.com/files/Heidegger-Martin-Being-and-Time-trans.-Macquarrie-Robinson-Blackwell-1962.pdf}} See page 39.&lt;/ref&gt; be free to reveal themselves as they are, and stated:
{{quote|“Truth” is not a feature of correct propositions which are asserted of an “object” by a human “subject” and then are “valid” somewhere, in what sphere we know not. Rather, truth is disclosure of beings through which an openness essentially unfolds [''west''].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last=Heidegger| first=Martin| title=On the Essence of Truth| year=1943| url=https://aphelis.net/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/Martin-Heidegger-On-the-Essence-of-Truth.pdf}} See pages 7-8. The quoted text is translated from the German by John Sallis.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Gödel agreed that the ability to perceive the truth of a mathematical or logical proposition is a matter of [[logical intuition|intuition]], an ability he admitted could be ultimately beyond the scope of a formal theory of logic or mathematics&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| last=Ravitch| first=Harold| title=On Gödel's Philosophy of Mathematics| year=1998| url=http://www.friesian.com/goedel/chap-2.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| last=Solomon| first=Martin| title=On Kurt Gödel's Philosophy of Mathematics| year=1998| url=http://calculemus.org/lect/07logika/godel-solomon.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; and perhaps best considered in the realm of human [[comprehension (logic)|comprehension]] and communication, but commented:

===Tarski's semantic theory of truth===
{{main|Semantic theory of truth|Tarski's theory of truth}}

The [[semantic theory of truth]] has as its general case for a given language:
:'P' is true if and only if P
where 'P' refers to the sentence (the sentence's name), and P is just the sentence itself.

[[Tarski's theory of truth]] (named after [[Alfred Tarski]]) was developed for formal languages, such as [[formal logic]]. Here he restricted it in this way: no language could contain its own truth predicate, that is, the expression ''is true'' could only apply to sentences in some other language. The latter he called an ''object language'', the language being talked about. (It may, in turn, have a truth predicate that can be applied to sentences in still another language.) The reason for his restriction was that languages that contain their own truth predicate will contain [[Liar paradox|paradoxical]] sentences such as, "This sentence is not true". As a result, Tarski held that the semantic theory could not be applied to any natural language, such as English, because they contain their own truth predicates. [[Donald Davidson (philosopher)|Donald Davidson]] used it as the foundation of his [[truth-conditional semantics]] and linked it to [[radical interpretation]] in a form of [[coherentism]].

[[Bertrand Russell]] is credited with noticing the existence of such paradoxes even in the best symbolic formations of mathematics in his day, in particular the paradox that came to be named after him, [[Russell's paradox]]. Russell and [[Alfred North Whitehead|Whitehead]] attempted to solve these problems in ''[[Principia Mathematica]]'' by putting statements into a hierarchy of [[type theory|types]], wherein a statement cannot refer to itself, but only to statements lower in the hierarchy.  This in turn led to new orders of difficulty regarding the precise natures of types and the structures of conceptually possible [[type system]]s that have yet to be resolved to this day.

===Kripke's semantic theory of truth===
{{Main|Kripke's theory of truth}}
[[Kripke's theory of truth]] (named after [[Saul Kripke]]) contends that a natural language can in fact contain its own truth predicate without giving rise to contradiction. He showed how to construct one as follows:
* Begin with a subset of sentences of a natural language that contains no occurrences of the expression "is true" (or "is false"). So ''The barn is big'' is included in the subset, but not " ''The barn is big'' is true", nor problematic sentences such as "''This sentence'' is false".
* Define truth just for the sentences in that subset.
* Then extend the definition of truth to include sentences that predicate truth or falsity of one of the original subset of sentences. So "''The barn is big'' is true" is now included, but not either "''This sentence'' is false" nor "'''The barn is big'' is true' is true".
* Next, define truth for all sentences that predicate truth or falsity of a member of the second set. Imagine this process repeated infinitely, so that truth is defined for ''The barn is big''; then for "''The barn is big'' is true"; then for "'''The barn is big'' is true' is true", and so on.

Notice that truth never gets defined for sentences like ''This sentence is false'', since it was not in the original subset and does not predicate truth of any sentence in the original or any subsequent set. In Kripke's terms, these are "ungrounded." Since these sentences are never assigned either truth or falsehood even if the process is carried out infinitely, Kripke's theory implies that some sentences are neither true nor false. This contradicts the [[Principle of bivalence]]: every sentence must be either true or false. Since this principle is a key premise in deriving the [[Liar paradox]], the paradox is dissolved.&lt;ref&gt;Kripke, Saul. "Outline of a Theory of Truth", Journal of Philosophy, 72 (1975), 690–716&lt;/ref&gt;

However, it has been shown by [[Proof sketch for Gödel's first incompleteness theorem|Gödel]] that self-reference cannot be avoided naively, since propositions about seemingly unrelated objects can have an informal self-referential meaning; in Gödel's work, these objects are integer numbers, and they have an informal meaning regarding propositions. In fact, this idea—manifested by the [[diagonal lemma]]—is the basis for [[Tarski's undefinability theorem|Tarski's theorem]] that truth cannot be consistently defined.

It has thus been claimed&lt;ref&gt;Keith Simmons, ''Universality and the Liar: An Essay on Truth and the Diagonal Argument'', Cambridge University Press, Cambridge 1993&lt;/ref&gt; that Kripke's system indeed leads to contradiction: while its truth predicate is only partial, it does give truth value (true/false) to propositions such as the one built in Tarski's proof, and is therefore inconsistent. While there is still a debate on whether Tarski's proof can be implemented to every similar partial truth system, none have been shown to be consistent by [[Consistency proof|acceptable methods]] used in [[mathematical logic]].

===Revision theory of truth===
{{Main|Revision theory#Truth}}

The revision theory of truth, as developed by Anil Gupta and Nuel Belnap, takes truth to be a circular concept whose definition is the set of biconditionals of the form
:'A' is true if and only if A.&lt;ref&gt;Gupta and Belnap (1993).&lt;/ref&gt;
Unlike Kripke's theory of truth, revision theory can be used with classical logic and can maintain the principle of bivalence.

==Folk beliefs about truth==
The [[truth predicate]] "''P'' is true" has great practical value in human language, allowing us to ''efficiently'' endorse or impeach claims made by others, to emphasize the truth or falsity of a statement, or to enable various indirect ([[Gricean]]) conversational implications.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Scharp|first1=Kevin|title=Replacing truth|date=2013|publisher=Oxford Univ.

"Meta‐analysis of theory‐of‐mind development: the truth about false belief." Child development 72.3 (2001): 655-684.&lt;/ref&gt; by adulthood we have strong implicit intuitions about "truth" that form a "folk theory" of truth. These intuitions include:&lt;ref&gt;Lynch, Michael P. "Alethic functionalism and our folk theory of truth." Synthese 145.1 (2005): 29-43.&lt;/ref&gt;

* Capture (''T''-in): If ''P'', then ''P'' is true
* Release (''T''-out): If ''P'' is true, then ''P''
* [[Law of noncontradiction|Noncontradiction]]: A statement can't be both true and false
* Normativity: It is usually good to believe what is true
* False beliefs: The notion that believing a statement doesn't necessarily make it true

Like many folk theories, our folk theory of truth is useful in everyday life but, upon deep analysis, turns out to be technically self-contradictory; in particular, any [[formal system]] that fully obeys Capture and Release semantics for truth (also known as the ''[[T-schema]]''), and that also respects classical logic, is provably [[inconsistent]] and succumbs to the [[liar paradox]] or to a similar contradiction.&lt;ref&gt;Bueno, Otávio, and Mark Colyvan.

===Ancient history===
The ancient [[Greek language|Greek]] origins of the words "true" and "truth" have some consistent definitions throughout great spans of history that were often associated with topics of [[logic]], [[geometry]], [[mathematics]], [[Deductive reasoning|deduction]], [[inductive reasoning|induction]], and [[natural philosophy]].

[[Socrates]]', [[Plato]]'s and [[Aristotle]]'s ideas about truth are seen by some as consistent with correspondence theory. In his ''[[Metaphysics (Aristotle)|Metaphysics]]'', Aristotle stated:  "To say of what is that it is not, or of what is not that it is, is false, while to say of what is that it is, and of what is not that it is not, is true".&lt;ref name=StanfordCorr&gt;David, Marion (2005). [http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/truth-correspondence/#1 "Correspondence Theory of Truth"] in [[Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy]]&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy]] proceeds to say of Aristotle:

&lt;blockquote&gt;[...] Aristotle sounds much more like a genuine correspondence theorist in the ''Categories'' (12b11, 14b14), where he talks of "underlying things" that make statements true and implies that these "things" (pragmata) are logically structured situations or facts (viz., his sitting, his not sitting). Most influential is his claim in ''De Interpretatione'' (16a3) that thoughts are "likenesses" (homoiosis) of things. Although he nowhere defines truth in terms of a thought's likeness to a thing or fact, it is clear that such a definition would fit well into his overall philosophy of mind. [...]&lt;ref name=StanfordCorr/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Very similar statements can also be found in Plato (Cratylus 385b2, Sophist 263b).&lt;ref name=StanfordCorr/&gt;

In [[Hinduism]], Truth is defined as "unchangeable", "that which has no distortion", "that which is beyond distinctions of time, space, and person", "that which pervades the universe in all its constancy". The human body, therefore is not completely true as it changes with time, for example. There are many references, properties and explanations of truth by Hindu sages that explain varied facets of truth, such as the national motto of [[India]]: "[[Satyameva Jayate]]" (Truth alone wins), as well as "Satyam muktaye" (Truth liberates), "Satya' is 'Parahit'artham' va'unmanaso yatha'rthatvam' satyam" (Satya is the benevolent use of words and the mind for the welfare of others or in other words responsibilities is truth too), "When one is firmly established in speaking truth, the fruits of action become subservient to him ( patanjali yogasutras, sutra number 2.36 ), "The face of truth is covered by a golden bowl. ''Unveil it, O Pusan (Sun), so that I who have truth as my duty (satyadharma) may see it!''" (Brhadaranyaka V 15 1–4 and the brief IIsa Upanisad 15–18), Truth is superior to silence ([[Manusmriti]]), etc. Combined with other words, satya acts as modifier, like "'''ultra'''" or "'''highest'''," or more literally "'''truest'''," connoting '''purity and excellence'''. For example, satyaloka is the "highest heaven' and Satya Yuga is the "golden age" or best of the four cyclical cosmic ages in Hinduism, and so on.

===Middle Ages===

====Avicenna (980–1037)====
In [[early Islamic philosophy]], [[Avicenna]] (Ibn Sina) defined truth in his work [[Kitab Al-Shifa]] ''[[The Book of Healing]]'', Book I, Chapter 8, as:

''{{quote|What corresponds in the mind to what is outside it.&lt;ref&gt;Osman Amin (2007), "Influence of Muslim Philosophy on the West", ''Monthly Renaissance'' '''17''' (11).&lt;/ref&gt;}}''

[[Avicenna]] elaborated on his definition of truth later in Book VIII, Chapter 6:

''{{Quote|The truth of a thing is the property of the being of each thing which has been established in it.&lt;ref name=Aertsen&gt;Jan A. Aertsen (1988), ''Nature and Creature: Thomas Aquinas's Way of Thought'', p. 152. Brill, {{ISBN|90-04-08451-7}}.&lt;/ref&gt;}}''

However, this definition is merely a rendering of the [[medieval]] Latin translation of the work by Simone van Riet.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book
| author = Simone van Riet
| title = Liber de philosophia prima, sive Scientia divina
| page = 413
| language = Latin}}&lt;/ref&gt; A modern translation of the original Arabic text states:

''{{quote|Truth is also said of the veridical belief in the existence [of something]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

| isbn = 978-0-934893-77-0
}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

====Aquinas (1225–1274)====
Reevaluating Avicenna, and also Augustine and Aristotle, [[Thomas Aquinas]] stated in his ''Disputed Questions on Truth'':

{{quote|A natural thing, being placed between two intellects, is called ''true'' insofar as it conforms to either. It is said to be true with respect to its conformity with the divine intellect insofar as it fulfills the end to which it was ordained by the divine intellect... With respect to its conformity with a human intellect, a thing is said to be true insofar as it is such as to cause a true estimate about itself.&lt;ref&gt;''Disputed Questions on Truth'', 1, 2, c, reply to Obj. 1. Trans. Mulligan, McGlynn, Schmidt, ''Truth'', vol. I, pp. 10–12.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Thus, for Aquinas, the truth of the human intellect (logical truth) is based on the truth in things (ontological truth).&lt;ref&gt;"Veritas supra ens fundatur" (Truth is founded on being). ''Disputed Questions on Truth'', 10, 2, reply to Obj. 3.&lt;/ref&gt; Following this, he wrote an elegant re-statement of Aristotle's view in his [http://www.newadvent.org/summa/1016.htm Summa I.16.1]:

{{quote|Veritas est adæquatio intellectus et rei. &lt;br&gt; (Truth is the conformity of the intellect and things.)}}  Aquinas also said that real things participate in the act of being of the [[God|Creator God]] who is Subsistent Being, Intelligence, and Truth. Thus, these beings possess the light of intelligibility and are knowable. These things (beings; [[reality]]) are the foundation of the truth that is found in the human mind, when it acquires knowledge of things, first through the [[sense]]s, then through the [[understanding]] and the [[judgement]] done by [[reason]]. For Aquinas, human [[intelligence]] ("intus", within and "legere", to read) has the capability to reach the [[essence]] and [[existence]] of things because it has a non-material, [[Spirituality|spiritual]] element, although some moral, educational, and other elements might interfere with its capability.

====Changing concepts of truth in the Middle Ages====
[[Richard Firth Green]] examined the concept of truth in the later Middle Ages in his ''A Crisis of Truth'', and concludes that roughly during the reign of [[Richard II of England]] the very meaning of the concept changes. The idea of the oath, which was so much part and parcel of for instance [[Romance (heroic literature)|Romance literature]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Rock|first=Catherine A.|year=2006|title=Forsworn and Fordone: Arcite as Oath-Breaker in the "Knight's Tale"|journal=[[The Chaucer Review]]|volume=40|issue=4|pages=416–32|jstor=25094334|doi=10.1353/cr.2006.0009}}&lt;/ref&gt; changes from a subjective concept to a more objective one (in [[Derek Pearsall]]'s summary).&lt;ref name=pearsall&gt;{{cite journal|last=Pearsall|first=Derek|year=2004|title=Medieval Literature and Historical Enquiry|journal=[[Modern Language Review]]|volume=99|issue=4|pages=xxxi–xlii|jstor=3738608|doi=10.2307/3738608}}&lt;/ref&gt; Whereas truth (the "trouthe" of ''[[Sir Gawain and the Green Knight]]'') was first "an ethical truth in which truth is understood to reside in persons", in Ricardian England it "transforms...into a [[political truth]] in which truth is understood to reside in documents".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Fowler|first=Elizabeth|year=2003|title=Rev. of Green, ''A Crisis of Truth''|journal=[[Speculum (journal)|Speculum]]|volume=78|issue=1|pages=179–82|jstor=3301477|doi=10.1017/S0038713400099310}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Modern age===

====Kant (1724–1804)====
[[File:Immanuel Kant (painted portrait).jpg|thumb|[[Immanuel Kant]]]]

[[Immanuel Kant]] endorses a definition of truth along the lines of the correspondence theory of truth.&lt;ref name=StanfordCorr/&gt; Kant writes in the ''[[Critique of Pure Reason]]'': "The nominal definition of truth, namely that it is the agreement of cognition with its object, is here granted and presupposed".&lt;ref name = "Kant-1781"&gt;Kant, Immanuel (1781/1787), ''[[Critique of Pure Reason]]''. Translated and edited by Paul Guyer and Allen W. Wood (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1998), A58/B82.&lt;/ref&gt; However, Kant denies that this correspondence definition of truth provides us with a test or criterion to establish which judgements are true. Kant states in his logic lectures:
&lt;blockquote&gt;[...] Truth, it is said, consists in the agreement of cognition with its object. In consequence of this mere nominal definition, my cognition, to count as true, is supposed to agree with its object. Now I can compare the object with my cognition, however, only ''by cognizing it''.&lt;!-- I wonder if the original had this cursive... --&gt; Hence my cognition is supposed to confirm itself, which is far short of being sufficient for truth. For since the object is outside me, the cognition in me, all I can ever pass judgement on is whether my cognition of the object agrees with my cognition of the object.

The ancients called such a circle in explanation a ''diallelon''. And actually the logicians were always reproached with this mistake by the sceptics, who observed that with this definition of truth it is just as when someone makes a statement before a court and in doing so appeals to a witness with whom no one is acquainted, but who wants to establish his credibility by maintaining that the one who called him as witness is an honest man. The accusation was grounded, too. Only the solution of the indicated problem is impossible without qualification and for every man. [...]&lt;ref name = "Kant-1801"&gt;Kant, Immanuel (1801), ''The Jäsche Logic'', in ''Lectures on Logic''. Translated and edited by J. Michael Young (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1992), pp. 557–58.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
This passage makes use of his distinction between nominal and real definitions. A nominal definition explains the meaning of a linguistic expression. A real definition describes the essence of certain [[Object (philosophy)|objects]] and enables us to determine whether any given item falls within the definition.&lt;ref name = "Vanzo-Kant"&gt;Alberto Vanzo, "Kant on the Nominal Definition of Truth", ''Kant-Studien'', 101 (2010), pp. 147–66.&lt;/ref&gt; Kant holds that the definition of truth is merely nominal and, therefore, we cannot employ it to establish which judgements are true. According to Kant, the ancient skeptics were critical of the logicians for holding that, by means of a merely nominal definition of truth, they can establish which judgements are true. They were trying to do something that is "impossible without qualification and for every man".&lt;ref name = "Kant-1801" /&gt;

====Hegel (1770–1831)====
[[Georg Hegel]] distanced his philosophy from psychology by presenting truth as being an external self-moving object instead of being related to inner, subjective thoughts. Hegel's truth is analogous to the [[mechanics]] of a material body in motion under the influence of its own inner force. "Truth is its own self-movement within itself."&lt;ref&gt;"Die Wahrheit ist die Bewegung ihrer an ihr selbst." ''[[The Phenomenology of Spirit]]'', Preface, ¶ 48&lt;/ref&gt; Teleological truth moves itself in the three-step form of [[Dialectic|dialectical triplicity]] toward the final goal of perfect, final, absolute truth. According to Hegel, the progression of philosophical truth is a resolution of past oppositions into increasingly more accurate approximations of absolute truth. [[Heinrich Moritz Chalybäus|Chalybäus]] used the terms "[[Thesis, antithesis, synthesis|thesis]]", "[[Thesis, antithesis, synthesis|antithesis]]", and "[[Thesis, antithesis, synthesis|synthesis]]" to describe Hegel's dialectical triplicity.  The "thesis" consists of an incomplete historical movement. To resolve the incompletion, an "antithesis" occurs which opposes the "thesis." In turn, the "synthesis" appears when the "thesis" and "antithesis" become [[Aufheben|reconciled]] and a higher level of truth is obtained. This "synthesis" thereby becomes a "thesis," which will again necessitate an "antithesis," requiring a new "synthesis" until a final state is reached as the result of reason's historical movement. History is the [[Absolute (philosophy)|Absolute Spirit]] moving toward a goal. This historical progression will finally conclude itself when the Absolute Spirit understands its own infinite self at the very end of history. Absolute Spirit will then be the complete expression of an infinite [[God]].

====Schopenhauer (1788–1860)====
For [[Arthur Schopenhauer]],&lt;ref&gt;''On the Fourfold Root of the Principle of Sufficient Reason'', §§ 29–33&lt;/ref&gt; a [[judgment]] is a combination or separation of two or more [[concept]]s. If a judgment is to be an expression of [[knowledge]], it must have a [[Principle of sufficient reason|sufficient reason]] or ground by which the judgment could be called true. ''Truth is the reference of a judgment to something different from itself which is its sufficient reason (ground)''. Judgments can have material, formal, transcendental, or metalogical truth. A judgment has ''material'' truth if its concepts are based on intuitive perceptions that are generated from sensations. If a judgment has its reason (ground) in another judgment, its truth is called logical or ''formal''. If a judgment, of, for example, pure mathematics or pure science, is based on the forms (space, time, causality) of intuitive, empirical knowledge, then the judgment has ''transcendental'' truth.

====Kierkegaard (1813–1855)====
When [[Søren Kierkegaard]], as his character ''Johannes Climacus'', ends his writings: ''My thesis was, subjectivity, heartfelt is the truth'', he does not advocate for [[subjectivism]] in its extreme form (the theory that something is true simply because one believes it to be so), but rather that the objective approach to matters of personal truth cannot shed any light upon that which is most essential to a person's life. Objective truths are concerned with the facts of a person's being, while subjective truths are concerned with a person's way of being. Kierkegaard agrees that objective truths for the study of subjects like mathematics, science, and history are relevant and necessary, but argues that objective truths do not shed any light on a person's inner relationship to existence. At best, these truths can only provide a severely narrowed perspective that has little to do with one's actual experience of life.&lt;ref&gt;Kierkegaard, Søren. ''Concluding Unscientific Postscript''. Princeton, Princeton University Press, 1992&lt;/ref&gt;

While objective truths are final and static, subjective truths are continuing and dynamic. The truth of one's existence is a living, inward, and subjective experience that is always in the process of becoming. The values, morals, and spiritual approaches a person adopts, while not denying the existence of objective truths of those beliefs, can only become truly known when they have been inwardly appropriated through subjective experience. Thus, Kierkegaard criticizes all systematic philosophies which attempt to know life or the truth of existence via theories and objective knowledge about reality. As Kierkegaard claims, human truth is something that is continually occurring, and a human being cannot find truth separate from the subjective experience of one's own existing, defined by the values and fundamental essence that consist of one's way of life.&lt;ref&gt;Watts, Michael. ''Kierkegaard'', Oxford: Oneworld Publications, 2003&lt;/ref&gt;

====Nietzsche (1844–1900)====
[[Friedrich Nietzsche]] believed the search for truth, or 'the will to truth', was a consequence of the ''[[will to power]]'' of philosophers. He thought that truth should be used as long as it promoted life and the ''will to power'', and he thought untruth was better than truth if it had this life enhancement as a consequence. As he wrote in ''[[Beyond Good and Evil]]'', "The falseness of a judgment is to us not necessarily an objection to a judgment... The question is to what extent it is life-advancing, life-preserving, species-preserving, perhaps even species-breeding..." (aphorism 4). He proposed the ''will to power'' as a truth only because, according to him, it was the most life-affirming and sincere perspective one could have.

Robert Wicks discusses Nietzsche's basic view of truth as follows:
&lt;blockquote&gt;[...] Some scholars regard Nietzsche's 1873 unpublished essay, "On Truth and Lies in a Nonmoral Sense" ("Über Wahrheit und Lüge im außermoralischen Sinn") as a keystone in his thought. In this essay, Nietzsche rejects the idea of universal constants, and claims that what we call "truth" is only "a mobile army of metaphors, metonyms, and anthropomorphisms." His view at this time is that arbitrariness completely prevails within human experience: concepts originate via the very artistic transference of nerve stimuli into images; "truth" is nothing more than the invention of fixed conventions for merely practical purposes, especially those of repose, security and consistence. [...]&lt;ref&gt;Robert Wicks, [http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/nietzsche/#EarWri187187 Friedrich Nietzsche – Early Writings: 1872–1876], The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy  (Spring 2008 Edition), Edward N. Zalta (ed.)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Separately Nietzsche suggested that an ancient, metaphysical belief in the divinity of Truth lies at the heart of and has served as the foundation for the entire subsequent [[Western intellectual tradition]]: "But you will have gathered what I am getting at, namely, that it is still a metaphysical faith on which our faith in science rests—that even we knowers of today, we godless anti-metaphysicians still take ''our'' fire too, from the flame lit by the thousand-year old faith, the Christian faith which was also Plato's faith, that God is Truth; that Truth is 'Divine'..."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=Vf8KETLiKXMC&amp;pg=PA201&amp;lpg=PA201&amp;dq=%22even%20we%20knowers%20of%20today%22#v=onepage&amp;q=%22even%20we%20knowers%20of%20today%22&amp;f=false|title=Nietzsche: The Gay Science: With a Prelude in German Rhymes and an Appendix of Songs|first1=Friedrich|last1=Nietzsche|first2=Bernard|last2=Williams|first3=Josefine|last3=Nauckhoff|date=23 August 2001|publisher=Cambridge University Press|via=Google Books|isbn=9780521636452}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=wMzu8j4D1SYC&amp;pg=PA112&amp;lpg=PA112&amp;dq=%22even%20we%20knowers%20of%20today%22#v=onepage&amp;q=god%20is%20truth&amp;f=false|title=Nietzsche: 'On the Genealogy of Morality' and Other Writings Student Edition|first=Friedrich|last=Nietzsche|date=30 October 2006|publisher=Cambridge University Press|via=Google Books|isbn=9781139461214}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Heidegger (1889–1976)====
Other philosophers take this common meaning to be secondary and derivative. According to [[Martin Heidegger]], the original meaning and [[essence]] of truth in [[Ancient Greece]] was unconcealment, or the revealing or bringing of what was previously hidden into the open, as indicated by the original Greek term for truth, ''[[aletheia]]''.&lt;ref&gt;http://aphelis.net/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/Martin-Heidegger-On-the-Essence-of-Truth.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ontology.co/heidegger-aletheia.htm|title=Martin Heidegger on Aletheia (Truth) as Unconcealment|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; On this view, the conception of truth as correctness is a later derivation from the concept's original essence, a development Heidegger traces to the [[Latin]] term ''[[veritas]]''.

====Whitehead (1861–1947)====
[[Alfred North Whitehead]], a British mathematician who became an American philosopher, said: "There are no whole truths; all truths are half-truths. It is trying to treat them as whole truths that plays the devil".&lt;ref&gt;Alfred North Whitehead, ''Dialogues'', 1954: Prologue.&lt;/ref&gt;

The logical progression or connection of this line of thought is to conclude that truth can lie, since [[half-truth]]s are deceptive and may lead to a false conclusion.

====Peirce (1839–1914)====
[[Pragmatists]] like [[C. S. Peirce]] take truth to have some manner of essential relation to human practices for inquiring into and [[discovering]] truth, with Peirce himself holding that truth is what human [[inquiry]] would find out on a matter, if our practice of inquiry were taken as far as it could profitably go: "The opinion which is fated to be ultimately agreed to by all who investigate, is what we mean by the truth..."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.peirce.org/writings/p119.html|title=How to Make Our Ideas Clear|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Nishida (1870–1945)====
According to [[Kitaro Nishida]], "knowledge of things in the world begins with the differentiation of unitary consciousness into knower and known and ends with self and things becoming one again. Such unification takes form not only in knowing but in the valuing (of truth) that directs knowing, the willing that directs action, and the feeling or emotive reach that directs sensing."&lt;ref&gt;John Maraldo, [http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/nishida-kitaro/#2.2 Nishida Kitarô – Self-Awareness], in: ''The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy'' (Spring 2005 Edition), Edward N. Zalta (ed.)&lt;/ref&gt;

====Fromm (1900–1980)====
[[Erich Fromm]] finds that trying to discuss truth as "absolute truth" is sterile and that emphasis ought to be placed on "optimal truth". He considers truth as stemming from the survival imperative of grasping one's environment physically and intellectually, whereby young children instinctively seek truth so as to orient themselves in "a strange and powerful world". The accuracy of their perceived approximation of the truth will therefore have direct consequences on their ability to deal with their environment. Fromm can be understood to define truth as a functional approximation of reality. His vision of optimal truth is described partly in "Man from Himself: An Inquiry into the Psychology of Ethics" (1947), from which excerpts are included below.

: the dichotomy between 'absolute = perfect' and 'relative = imperfect' has been superseded in all fields of scientific thought, where "it is generally recognized that there is no absolute truth but nevertheless that there are objectively valid laws and principles".

: In that respect, "a scientifically or rationally valid statement means that the power of reason is applied to all the available data of observation without any of them being suppressed or falsified for the sake of a desired result". The history of science is "a history of inadequate and incomplete statements, and every new insight makes possible the recognition of the inadequacies of previous propositions and offers a springboard for creating a more adequate formulation."

: As a result "the history of thought is the history of an ever-increasing approximation to the truth. Scientific knowledge is not absolute but optimal; it contains the optimum of truth attainable in a given historical period." Fromm furthermore notes that "different cultures have emphasized various aspects of the truth" and that increasing interaction between cultures allows for these aspects to reconcile and integrate, increasing further the approximation to the truth.

====Foucault (1926–1984)====
[[File:What-is-truth02.jpg|thumb|''[[John 18:38|Quid Est Veritas?]]'' [[Christ]] and [[Pilate]], by [[Nikolai Ge]].]]

Truth, says [[Michel Foucault]], is problematic when any attempt is made to see truth as an "objective" quality.  He prefers not to use the term truth itself but "Regimes of Truth".  In his historical investigations he found truth to be something that was itself a part of, or embedded within, a given power structure.  Thus Foucault's view shares much in common with the concepts of [[Truth#Nietzsche|Nietzsche]].  Truth for Foucault is also something that shifts through various [[episteme]] throughout history.&lt;ref&gt;Foucault, M. "The Order of Things", London: Vintage Books, 1970 (1966)&lt;/ref&gt;

====Baudrillard (1929–2007)====
[[Jean Baudrillard]] considered truth to be largely simulated, that is pretending to have something, as opposed to dissimulation, pretending to not have something.  He took his cue from [[iconoclasm|iconoclasts]] who he claims knew that images of God demonstrated that God did not exist.&lt;ref name = "Baudrillard"&gt;Jean Baudrillard. Simulacra and Simulation. Michigan: Michigan University Press, 1994.&lt;/ref&gt; Baudrillard wrote in "Precession of the Simulacra":
::The [[simulacrum]] is never that which conceals the truth—it is the truth which conceals that there is none.  The simulacrum is true.
::—Ecclesiastes&lt;ref&gt;Baudrillard, Jean.

[[Mark Poster]], [[Stanford University Press]], 1988; 166 ''ff''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Baudrillard's attribution of this quote to [[Ecclesiastes]] is deliberately fictional. "Baudrillard attributes this quote to Ecclesiastes.  However, the quote is a fabrication (see Jean Baudrillard.  Cool Memories III, 1991–95. London:   Verso, 1997). Editor's note: In Fragments: Conversations With François L'Yvonnet. New York: Routledge, 2004:11, Baudrillard acknowledges this 'Borges-like' fabrication." Cited in footnote #4 in Smith, Richard G., [https://www.ubishops.ca/baudrillardstudies/vol2_1/smith.htm#_edn4 "Lights, Camera, Action: Baudrillard and the Performance of Representations"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180425060347/https://www2.ubishops.ca/baudrillardstudies/vol2_1/smith.htm#_edn4 |date=2018-04-25 }}, International Journal of Baudrillard Studies, Volume 2, Number 1 (January 2005)&lt;/ref&gt;

Some examples of simulacra that Baudrillard cited were: that prisons simulate the "truth" that society is free; scandals (e.g., [[Watergate scandal|Watergate]]) simulate that corruption is corrected; Disney simulates that the U.S. itself is an adult place. One must remember that though such examples seem extreme, such extremity is an important part of Baudrillard's theory. For a less extreme example, consider how movies usually end with the bad being punished, humiliated, or otherwise failing, thus affirming for viewers the concept that the good end happily and the bad unhappily, a narrative which implies that the status quo and established power structures are largely legitimate.&lt;ref name = "Baudrillard"/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3214">In linguistics, '''variable rules analysis''' is a set of [[statistical analysis]] methods commonly used in [[sociolinguistics]] and [[historical linguistics]] to describe patterns of [[Variation (linguistics)|variation]] between alternative forms in language use. It is also sometimes known as '''Varbrul analysis''', after the name of a software package dedicated to carrying out the relevant statistical computations (''Varbrul'', from "'''var'''ia'''b'''le '''rul'''e"). The method goes back to a theoretical approach developed by the sociolinguist [[William Labov]] in the late 1960s and early 1970s, and its mathematical implementation was developed by Henrietta Cedergren and [[David Sankoff]] in 1974.&lt;ref&gt;Cedergren, H.; and Sankoff, D. (1974). Variable rules: Performance as a statistical reflection of competence. ''Language'', ''50'', 333-355.&lt;/ref&gt;

A variable rules analysis is designed to provide a quantitative model of a situation where speakers alternate between different forms that have the same meaning and stand in [[free variation]], but in such a way that the probability of choice of either the one or the other form is conditioned by a variety of context factors or social characteristics. Such a situation, where variation is not entirely random but rule-governed, is also known as "structured variation". A variable rules analysis computes a [[multivariate analysis|multivariate]] statistical model, on the basis of observed token counts, such that each determining factor is assigned a numerical factor weight that describes how it influences the probabilities of choice of either form. This is done by means of [[stepwise regression|stepwise]] [[logistic regression]], using a [[maximum likelihood]] algorithm.

Although the necessary computations required for a variable rules analysis can be carried out with the help of mainstream general-purpose statistics software packages such as [[SPSS]], it is more often done by means of a specialised software dedicated to the needs of linguists, called ''Varbrul''. It was originally written by David Sankoff and currently exists in [[freeware]] implementations for [[Mac OS]] and [[Microsoft Windows]], under the title of ''Goldvarb X''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://individual.utoronto.ca/tagliamonte/goldvarb.html|title=Sali A. Tagliamonte: Goldvarb|website=individual.utoronto.ca}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are also versions implemented in the statistical language [[R (programming language)|R]] and therefore available on most platforms.  These include ''R-Varb'' and ''Rbrul''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.danielezrajohnson.com/rbrul.html|title=Rbrul|website=www.danielezrajohnson.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Variable rules approaches are commonly employed for the analysis of data in sociolinguistic research, especially in studies that aim to investigate how reflexes of linguistic change through time appear in the shape of structured variation patterns within a speech community.&lt;ref&gt;Tagliamonte, S. (2006). ''Analysing Sociolinguistic Variation.'' Cambridge: Cambridge University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Vetusta Monumenta''''' is the title of a published series of illustrated [[antiquary|antiquarian]] papers on ancient buildings, sites, and artefacts, mostly those of Britain, published at irregular intervals between 1718 and 1906 by the [[Society of Antiquaries of London]]. The [[Folio (printing)|folio]] sized papers, usually written by members of the society, were first published individually, and then later in collected volumes.&lt;ref name="Harris"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.royalacademy.org.uk/exhibitions/makinghistory/recording-and-illustrating,444,AR.html|title=: Antiquaries in Britain, 1707–2007 -  Recording and illustrating|last=Harris|first=Greg|work=Making History|publisher=Royal Academy of Arts|accessdate=24 November 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Publication==
The full title is ''Vetusta monumenta quae ad Rerum Britanicarum memoriam conservandam Societas Antiquariorum Londini sumptu suo edenda curavit'', but the volumes are normally simply cited as ''Vetusta Monumenta''. There were various reprints of both individual papers and collected volumes, and the plates were often published separately from the text. According to the HOLLIS database at [[Harvard]]: "The seven volumes are dated 1747, 1789, 1796, 1815, 1835, 1883 and 1906 (for the fourth part of vol.7). The plates for vol. 1 were published between 1718 and 1747; plates for vol. 2 were published between 1748 and 1789; plates for vol. 3 were published between 1790 and 1796; plates for vol. 4 were published between 1799 and 1815; plates for vol. 5 were published between 1816 and 1835; plates for vol. 6 were published between 1821 and 1885; plates for the four parts of vol. 7 were published between 1893 and 1906."&lt;ref&gt;[http://eresearch.lib.harvard.edu/V/T9H1EJI2QMR5XA1E97JX3K8YYF9GRUU5N3ISA1YINE3AHKKV3T-77390?func=quick-1 HOLLIS database at Harvard] (dynamic link - enter title)&lt;/ref&gt;

The series began the same year that the society formalized its existence with the first minuted meeting on January 1, 1718, at the Mitre Tavern, [[Fleet Street]]; the society's main journal ''[[Archaeologia_(London)#Publications|Archaeologia]]'' did not begin publication until 1770.  Members of the society received a free copy as each part was published.&lt;ref&gt;Harris, [http://www.royalacademy.org.uk/exhibitions/makinghistory/founding-the-society-of-antiquaries,449,AR.html ''Founding the Society of Antiquaries''] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120306034954/http://www.royalacademy.org.uk/exhibitions/makinghistory/founding-the-society-of-antiquaries,449,AR.html |date=March 6, 2012 }} and ''Recording and illustrating'', as above.&lt;/ref&gt;

The emphasis was on the large and detailed illustrations, initially  high quality [[engravings]], which conveyed information on the subject matter in an accessible and economical way.&lt;ref name="Nurse"&gt;{{cite web|title=The Embarkation of Henry VIII at Dover 1520|last=Nurse |first=Bernard (Librarian, RSA)|work=alecto historical editions|accessdate=23 November 2010|location=United Kingdom}}&lt;/ref&gt; Each issue was usually developed from papers and research of the society, giving a text description accompanied by illustrated details it had commissioned. The assemblage of maps, site plans, and other detail was a novelty that found popular appeal.

The views in the series contained images of people and other means of conveying scale, providing the perspective of the interested visitor. These accompanied text descriptions for the sites, but provided additional information with high levels of detail and multiple or idealised viewpoints to simulate a well informed tour. Many of the plates show the setting, inset with exploded views, cross sections and other architectural details, or objects found at the site. Other figures were interspersed with the text, or taking up several full pages. Critics have compared this approach with contemporaneous works that included the subject as an attractively sketched scene, illustrations were not yet recognised as a valuable source of information. The book used the multiple and separate details to synthesise encyclopaedic surveys that typified the approach of the natural historians and antiquaries, what [[Barbara Maria Stafford]] has described as "cross-referencing material bits of distant reality".&lt;ref name="Arnold1999"&gt;{{cite book|last=Arnold|first=Dana|title=The metropolis and its image: constructing identities for London, c. 1750-1950|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Ke4X4HjHTi8C&amp;pg=PA14|accessdate=23 November 2010|year=1999|publisher=Wiley-Blackwell|isbn=978-0-631-21667-4|pages=14–16|chapter=Atheticizing the Ancestral City}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An 1803 article on the [[Rosetta Stone]] was amongst the earliest published research.&lt;ref&gt;1803: "Has tabulas inscriptionem ... ad formam et modulum exemplaris inter spolia ex bello Aegyptiaco nuper reportati et in Museo Britannico asservati suo sumptu incidendas curavit Soc. Antiquar. Londin. A.D. MDCCCIII" in Vetusta Monumenta vol. 4 plates 5–7&lt;/ref&gt;  The first detailed account of the medieval French [[Royal Gold Cup]] in the [[British Museum]] was published in one of the last papers, of 1904, by Sir [[Charles Hercules Read]].&lt;ref&gt;Read, Sir Charles Hercules. ''The Royal Gold Cup of the Kings of France and England, now preserved in the British Museum''. ''Vetusta Monumenta'' Volume 7, part 3, 1904&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Vocabulario en lengua castellana y mexicana''''' is a bilingual dictionary of [[Spanish language|Spanish]] and [[Nahuatl]] by [[Alonso de Molina]], first published in 1555 originally entitled ''Aquí comiença un vocabulario en la lengua castellana y mexicana'', edited by Juan Pablos. It was the first dictionary to be published in the [[New World]]. However the most relevant and most famous edition was the one made in 1571, edited by Antonio de Spinosa, which then came to be named ''Vocabulario en lengua castellana y mexicana''. This new edition included the Nahuatl-to-Spanish section that the original didn't.

The [[Franciscans|Franciscan missionaries]] promoted the writing of literature works to evangelize the Indians in their own language, Nahuatl being language one of the most important considering that it was spoken throughout [[New Spain]]. After the [[Council of Trent]], the hierarchy of the Catholic Church recommended to preach in indigenous languages.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Hernández|first1=Esther|title=Vocabulario en lengua castellana y mexicana de fray Alonso de Molina, edición facsímil y estudio preliminar|publisher=Ediciones de Cultura Hispánica|location=Madrid, España|accessdate=13 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the rule of viceroy [[Martín Enríquez de Almanza]], Molina published Spanish-to-Nahuatl and Nahuatl-to-Spanish vocabularies to help the formation of priests that were to accomplish the evangelizing assignments.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Centro de Estudios de Historia de México Carso|title=0 años Centro de Estudios de Historia de México Carso. Fundación Carlos Slim.|date=2015|publisher=Fundación Carlos Slim|location=México|page=145|edition=first|accessdate=13 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Molina's ''Vocabulario'' is considered the most important dictionary of the [[Classical Nahuatl language]] and has continued to be reprinted into the 20th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Andrews, J. Richard |year=2005 |title=Introduction to Classical Nahuatl |others=revised edition |publisher=University of Oklahoma Press |page=658}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is typically referred to simply as ''Molina''.

==First printed vocabulary of an indigenous language==
[[File:13.- 50003 0004 - Alonso de Molina - Vocabulario en lengua mexicana y castellana c 1565.tif|thumb|Aquí comiença un vocabulario en la lengua castellana y mexicana]]
It is believed that Nahuatl was the first of the [[indigenous languages of the Americas]] to be linguistically studied, since the first preserved grammar of an American language is ''Arte de la lengua mexicana'' (1547) by [[Andrés de Olmos]]; moreover, shortly after in 1555, the first vocabulary of an indigenous language was published: Molina's vocabulary.

This first edition of the dictionary only contained the Spanish-to-Nahuatl section, based on which Molina made the 1571 edition adding the Nahuatl-to-Spanish section.

==Formal characteristics==
The 1571 ''Vocabulary'' de 1571 is divided in two sections, very much like modern bilingual dictionaries, individually foliated: the Spanish-to-Nahuatl section consists of 118 sheets and the Nahuatl-to-Spanish one, of 162 sheets. There are 4 columns on each sheet and each one of them contains approximately 35 entries, thus containing 16500 Spanish-to-Nahuatl entries and 22600 Nahuatl-to-Spanish entries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Hernández|first1=Esther|title=Vocabulario en lengua castellana y mexicana de fray Alonso de Molina|date=1996|publisher=Consejo Superior de Investigaciones Científicas|location=Madrid, España|accessdate=13 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first section is headed by the printing licenses and a letter to New Spain's viceroy, D. Martínez Enríquez.

Both sections are preceded by a foreword in which he justifies the work and where a series of notifications about the peculiarities of the Mexican language appeared.

At the end of the first section there is an attachment, that already appeared in the 1555 edition, where the Franciscan gives grammatical instructions of the numbers in Nahuatl, with equivalences in Spanish.

==Editions==
There are 7 known editions:
*1555. ''Aquí comiença un vocabulario en la lengua castellana y mexicana''.
*1571.
*1880, by Julios Platzman, Leipzig.
*1910, by Rufino González, Puebla Talleres el Escritorio, only Spanish-to-Nahuatl.
*1944, facsimile edition by Colección de Incunables americanos, siglo XVI, v. IV, Madrid, Cultura Hispánica.
*1966, abbreviated and modernized edition.
*1970, 1977 reprint. Mexico, Porrúa, preliminar study by [[Miguel León-Portilla]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1872">A '''{{IAST|vārttikakāra}}''' ({{lang-sa|वार्त्तिककार}}, {{IPA-sa|ʋɑːrttikəkɑːrə|IPA}}, ''Commentator''), in Indian [[Vyakarana|linguistics]] and [[Indian philosophy|philosophy]], is a person who wrote a critical commentary or a gloss on a given grammatical or philosophical work. 

Monier Williams Dictionary defines Vārttikakāra as a composer of vārttikas. A '''vārttika''' is defined as a single remark or a whole work attempting to present a detailed commentary. The word vārttik- derives from {{IAST|vṛtti}}, either in the sense of 'the turning ({{IAST|vṛt}}) of sūtra-formulation into a fully worded paraphrase' or, in the sense of 'procedure (of the teaching)'.&lt;ref&gt;Review: The Sanskrit Language, [[Paul Thieme]], Language, Vol. 31, No. 3. (Jul. - Sep., 1955), p. 429.&lt;/ref&gt;  According to the Indian tradition, the purpose of a vārttika is to enquire into what has been said (''ukta''), what has not been said (''anukta''), and what has not been said clearly (''durukta'').&lt;ref&gt;Suresvara’s Vartika on Jyotis Brahmana -edited, translated and annotated by K.P. Jog and Shoun Hino. Delhi, Motilal Banarsidass, 2001, {{ISBN|81-208-1756-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Famous Vārttikakāras==
* [[Sureśvara]] is the commentator of the [[Advaita]] [[Vedanta]] school. His famous commentaries include the Bŗhadāraņyakopanişad-bhāşya-vārttika and the Taittirīya-vārttika.
* [[Katyayana]] is identified as the Vārttikakāra of [[Vyākaraṇa|Indian linguistics]],&lt;ref&gt;"On the identity of the Varttikakara", [[Paul Thieme]], Indian culture 4 (1938), pp. 189-209&lt;/ref&gt; who wrote commentaries on {{IAST|[[Pāṇini]]}}'s [[Pāṇini#The Ashtadhyayi|{{IAST|Aṣṭādhyāyi}}]].

}}'''YTMND''', an initialism for "'''You're the Man Now, Dog'''", is an [[virtual community|online community]] centered on the creation of hosted [[Internet meme|memetic]] web pages (known within the community as ''fads'', ''YTMNDs'' or ''sites'') featuring a [[wikt:juxtaposition|juxtaposition]] of an image (still or short animation) centered or tiled along with optional large zooming text and a looping sound file. Images and sound files used in YTMNDs are usually either created or edited by users. YTMND is generally a humor website, owing its tone and culture to the original YTMND and its early imitators. Other YTMNDs, however, are artistic or political.

== History ==
YTMND originated in 2000 from Max Goldberg's original website, "[http://www.yourethemannowdog.com/ yourethemannowdog.com]", which he registered along with "[http://www.dustindiamond.com/ dustindiamond.com]" after seeing a [[trailer (film)|trailer]] for the movie ''[[Finding Forrester]]'' in which [[Sean Connery]] says the line "You're the man now, dog!". Originally, the website featured the text "YOURE THE MAN NOW DOG.COM" drawn out in [[3D computer graphics|3D]] [[ASCII art|ASCII text]] with a sound loop from the ''Finding Forrester'' trailer of [[Sean Connery]] reciting the phrase "You're the man now, dog!".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.yourethemannowdog.com/ | title=Yourethemannowdog.com from October 7, 2001 | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20011007184416/http://www.yourethemannowdog.com/ | archivedate=2001-10-07 | accessdate=2007-04-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; The advent of zoomed text currently on the website was seen in the following months, where the website also featured a photograph of [[Sean Connery]].&lt;!-- this is awkward --&gt; Goldberg's new
creation inspired others to make similar sites with other movie and television quotations (or any other sound clip they wished to use).&lt;ref name="wired"&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.wired.com/wired/archive/14.11/meganiche.html?pg=2&amp;topic=meganiche | publisher=[[Wired News]] | title=Wired 14.11: Tiny Slice, Big Market | accessdate=2007-02-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.yourethemannowdog.com/  | title=Yourethemannowdog.com from December 3, 2001 | publisher=Internet Archive | accessdate=2006-07-24 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20011203020131/http://www.yourethemannowdog.com/ |archivedate = 2001-12-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; At first, Goldberg maintained a list and [[mirror website|mirror]] of these sites,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.yourethemannowdog.com/contrib/ | title=Yourethemannowdog.com/contrib from March 30, 2005 | accessdate=2006-08-12 | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20050306071851/http://www.yourethemannowdog.com/contrib/ | archivedate=2005-03-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; but the list soon became exceptionally long.&lt;ref name="ytmndabout"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ytmnd.com/info/about|title=About YTMND| publisher=YTMND|accessdate=2006-06-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2004, Goldberg wrote a [[news release|press release]] after winning a lawsuit filed by [[Dustin Diamond]] for the "fan page" at the aforementioned dustindiamond.com. He mentioned yourethemannowdog.com, as well as a new website, YTMND, that would be ready by April 10. The website opened that day after a rushed coding and design process. The site caught on in popularity and became an [[list of Internet phenomena|Internet phenomenon]] when major [[blog|weblogs]] and [[Internet forum]]s began linking to the ''[[The Picard Song|Picard Song]]'' YTMND.&lt;ref name="ytmndabout" /&gt;

In November 2005, YTMND changed its layout and added new features, including a comment management system and new lists for the main page.&lt;ref name="nov2005"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.ytmnd.com/news/?news_id=3 | title=Welcome to the new face of ytmn(d-sfw)! | date=2005-11-25 | publisher=YTMND | accessdate=2006-06-18 }}&lt;/ref&gt; A feature debuted soon after allowing users to donate money on behalf of a YTMND chosen by the user in exchange for its increased exposure through the main site.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ytmnd.com/news/?news_id=7|title=Fund raising|publisher=YTMND|accessdate=2006-06-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On September 24, 2006, YTMND changed to a new layout and design.&lt;ref name="sep2006"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.ytmnd.com/news/?news_id=50 | title=Create like a god, command like a king, work like a slave | date=2006-09-24 | publisher=YTMND | accessdate=2006-09-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; The re-design added new features, such as the YTMND digest.&lt;ref name="ytmndigest"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ytmnd.com/browse/digest|title=YTMND – browse sites|publisher=YTMND|accessdate=2006-09-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;!--More features? Anyone?--&gt;

=== Decline ===

On August 29, 2016, Max Goldberg  that YTMND would likely soon be shutting down, citing ill health and the site's inability to fund its own hosting fees in ad revenue. Goldberg stated "Besides being a time capsule I don’t really see a reason for it to continue to exist... It seems like the internet has moved on...And I’ve moved on too. I don’t have much interest in the site beyond it being good memories."&lt;ref&gt;https://gizmodo.com/who-killed-ytmnd-1785765611&lt;/ref&gt; Despite this, the site remains open as of September 2018. On May 12, 2018, the site stopped accepting new user signups as a result of [[Google]] shutting down version 1 of its [[ReCAPTCHA]] [[Anti-spam techniques|anti-spam mechanism]].

== Conflicts ==

=== eBaum's World ===
In January 2006, [[eBaum's World]] hosted and [[digital watermarking|watermarked]] a [[Lindsay Lohan]] [[montage (filming)|montage]] created by YTMND user SpliceVW without crediting either SpliceVW or YTMND. In response to their actions, users from YTMND joined users from other Internet communities and launched an attack on the forums on eBaum's World, using spam posting and [[denial-of-service attack]]s to repeatedly crash them.{{Citation needed|date=April 2007}}

Goldberg denounced the ongoing attacks, stating that they had "really crossed the line" and were a "vulgar display of power".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.ytmnd.com/news/?news_id=13 | title=And the complaints come marching in | date=2006-01-08 | publisher=YTMND | accessdate=2006-06-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; He later stated that any YTMND member whose site promoted attacks would have his or her account deleted&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.ytmnd.com/news/?news_id=15 | title=Your account will be deleted if... | publisher=YTMND | date=2006-01-09 | accessdate=2006-06-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; and that the conflict had placed both himself and his hosting company in a negative light.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.ytmnd.com/news/?news_id=16 | title=To clarify my statement | date=2006-01-09 | publisher=YTMND | accessdate=2006-06-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On January 10, eBaum's World alleged the attacks were a form of [[cyberterrorism]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://ebaumsworld.com/response-01-10-06.html | title=Regarding the recent attacks on eBaum's World | date=2006-01-10 | publisher=eBaum's World | accessdate=2006-06-12 | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060601071237/http://www.ebaumsworld.com/response-01-10-06.html | archivedate=2006-06-01 | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; and on January 11, Neil Bauman, the executive vice president of eBaum's World, publicly stated that arrests were being made in relation to the attacks.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20060113071643/http://www.wcmf.com/Images/Docs/Links/1-11.mp3 Statement from Neil Bauman]&lt;/ref&gt; Eventually, Goldberg and Bauman came to an agreement: Bauman removed the montage from his website, and Goldberg removed references to "eBaum" from his.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.ytmnd.com/news/?news_id=17 | title=Cease and Desist from Neil Bauman | date=2006-01-10 | publisher=YTMND | accessdate=2006-06-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; Though the conflict was resolved, both sites experienced DDoS attacks on the morning of January 12, 2006.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.ytmnd.com/news/?news_id=20 | title=The never ending saga | date=2006-01-12 | publisher=YTMND | accessdate=2006-06-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Church of Scientology ===
On June 10, 2006, a [[cease and desist]] form was sent to Goldberg by lawyers of the [[Church of Scientology]], claiming that several YTMND pages with Scientology-related content had infringed on Scientology copyrights.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web
 |url=http://www.ytmnd.com/info/l_ron.html

 |archivedate=2006-06-23 
 |deadurl=yes 
 |df= 
}}&lt;/ref&gt; In response, Goldberg replied to the lawyer that the cease and desist form was "completely groundless" and he would not be deleting any Scientology-related sites.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.ytmnd.com/news/?news_id=39 | title=What you know about dat | date=2006-06-13 | publisher=YTMND | accessdate=2006-06-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; Days later, a [[Scientology]] page section appeared on the front page along with a disclaimer on the bottom stating the following: ''"This website is in no way affiliated, sponsored or owned by the Church of Scientology, [[L. Ron Hubbard]], [[Sea Org|SeaOrg]], [[Dianetics]], volcanoes or aliens of any sort. We are, however, sponsored by Citizens for the Release of [[Xenu]], a not-for-sanity organization."'' According to Goldberg, there have not been any recent updates regarding the potential lawsuit.&lt;ref name="Scientomogy"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.scientomogy.com/ytmnd.php|deadurl=yes|title="backup" copy [courtesy of the "archive dot org" site called the "Wayback machine"] of   Scientomogy.com|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070218200403/http://www.scientomogy.com:80/ytmnd.php |archivedate=February 18, 2007|work=scientomogy.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.ytmnd.com/news/?news_id=41 | title=Green onions | publisher=YTMND | date=2006-06-23 | accessdate=2006-06-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== "Moon Man" and YouTube ===
[[File:Mac Tonight.JPG|thumb|YTMND courted controversy with the character "Moon Man", based on McDonald's mascot [[Mac Tonight]]]]
The YTMND character "Moon Man", a white supremacist rapper character based on source videos of the [[McDonald's]] advertising campaign [[Mac Tonight]], garnered controversy shortly after its first remix in 2007. [[AT&amp;T]]'s [[text to speech]] program provided Moon Man's voice and was soon edited to block any racially derogatory epithets or swear words in an attempt to cull the number of remixes. McDonald's began removing existing Mac Tonight sculptures and animatronics from some of its restaurants in response to the widespread remixes, and [[YouTube]] began automatically striking down many Moon Man-related videos from 2007 to the present. Several videos were also [[DMCA]]-claimed and taken down by McDonald's from 2007–2008. Multiple [[change.org]] petitions were filed demanding YouTube cease removing the videos, the most recent of which from May 2015 having reaching over 1200 signatures. YouTube has since stopped taking Moon Man videos down unless they have been flagged by users.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Burke|first1=Timothy|title=Rape, Murder, Violent Racism: The Weirdest McDonald's Ad Campaign Ever|url=http://theconcourse.deadspin.com/rape-murder-violent-racism-the-weirdest-mcdonalds-ad-1673970057|website=The Concourse|publisher=The Concourse|accessdate=15 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Sega ===
On January 11, 2007, Goldberg revealed that [[Sega Europe]] had sent a [[cease and desist]] letter concerning the "Sonic Says..." fad, which features a clip from the [[Adventures of Sonic the Hedgehog|Sonic animated series]].  The letter alleged that consumers "may be confused into believing that [the offending pages are] in someway [sic] linked to or associated with" the company.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.ytmnd.com/news/?news_id=56 | title=Misirlou | publisher=YTMND | date=2007-01-11 | accessdate=2007-01-11 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In its letter, Sega stated that it would take legal action after seven days if ownership of all "that's no good" web domains were not handed over.  After almost two weeks of silence following the original 7-day limit, Goldberg declared the issue had "blown over."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.ytmnd.com/news/?news_id=57 | title=Deception | publisher=YTMND | date=2007-02-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Scholastic ===
On July 17, 2007, Goldberg received a string of letters and phone calls from lawyers representing [[Scholastic Corporation|Scholastic]] threatening legal action if sites revealing spoilers for ''[[Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows]]'' were not removed, in response to several YTMNDs with scanned pages that Goldberg posted on the front page. As more sites were created with spoilers, additional letters were sent. Goldberg responded to Scholastic by declining to take down Harry Potter-related sites.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ytmnd.com/news/?news_id=74 |title=Magic |author=Max |date=July 19, 2007 |work= |publisher=YTMND.com |accessdate=8 September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Pez ===
In May 2009, the [[Pez]] corporation sent a cease-and-desist letter regarding two YTMNDs depicting fake Pez dispensers with [[Adolf Hitler]] and [[Charles Manson]]'s heads on the containers, which they found insulting, and demanded that YTMND refrain from allowing any Pez-related items to be displayed on the site.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://wiki.ytmnd.com/Pez|title=Pez|work=ytmnd.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; Goldberg responded by starting a fad contest involving the candy company, with the prize being a possible [[lawsuit]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ytmnd.com/contests/?contest_id=6|title=ytmnd – you're the man now dog!|work=ytmnd.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Media exposure ==
Due to the nature and format of YTMNDs, the site has garnered attention from outside [[mass media|media sources]]. In 2005, [[Reuters]] wrote an article on Tom Cruise which made a reference to the ''Tom Cruise Kills Oprah'' YTMND.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/8366702/ | title=Once-aloof Cruise now spoofed | publisher=MSNBC | date=2005-06-27 | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20050628010403/http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/8366702/ | archivedate=2005-06-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; The site received further publicity when [[The Wall Street Journal]] published an article about YTMND, and mentioned several popular website creations, linking to many of them through their website. The original "Tom Cruise Kills Oprah" video, on which the YTMND is based, was mentioned on [[Dateline NBC]]'s "The Mank Blog" segment, [[VH1]]'s show "[[Web Junk 20]]", and [[CBC Newsworld]]'s [[CBC News: The Hour|"The Hour"]] with [[George Stroumboulopoulos]].&lt;ref name="mediasightings"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ytmnd.com/info/media_sightings |title=Media sightings |publisher=YTMND |accessdate=2006-06-18 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060705212248/http://www.ytmnd.com/info/media_sightings |archivedate=2006-07-05 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On the February 1, 2006, episode of ''[[Attack of the Show!]]'', viewers were asked to "make a kickass YTMND" for the show's "user created" segment. In order for sites to qualify for this YTMND competition, members were required to add "aots" at the beginning of the site's [[URL]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.g4tv.com/attackoftheshow/blog/AOTB/post/553546/User_Created_Challenge.html | title=User Created Challenge | publisher=G4 | accessdate=2006-06-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; In March, [[Game-Revolution]] held a contest for video game-themed YTMNDs. The winner won a [[PlayStation Portable|PSP]] as a prize.&lt;ref name="mediasightings" /&gt; In the March 2006 issue of ''[[Stuff (magazine)|Stuff]]'' magazine, there is a mention of the original "You're the Man Now Dog" website. YTMND was again mentioned in the magazine in June 2006 when a link to timetraveler.ytmnd.com was printed.&lt;ref name="mediasightings" /&gt; In May, [[Current TV]] host and producer [[Max Lugavere]] was spotted wearing a YTMND T-shirt on the network.&lt;ref name="mediasightings" /&gt; In the August 2006 issue of ''[[Wired (magazine)|WIRED]]'', an article under the "Expert" column by the name of "1 Web Site, 250,000 Idiotic Clips. LOL!" was printed. In the article, five of Goldberg's favorite YTMNDs (You're the Man Now, Dog; Vader Coaster; Lohan Facial; LOL Internet; Blue Ball Machine) were mentioned, along with commentary from Max himself for each one.  The article's writer, James Lee, can be quoted as saying "Repeat an image loop and a sound file – as 24-year-old Max Goldberg with You're the Man Now, Dog – and pretty soon you'll have 4 million visitors a month and 120,000 contributors uploading their own clips."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.wired.com/wired/archive/14.08/start.html?pg=13 | title=1 Web Site, 250,000 Idiotic Clips. LOL! | author=James Lee | publisher=[[Wired News]] |date=July 2006 | accessdate=2006-08-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; Also in August 2006, an effort of YTMND users to post satirical reviews on the [[Amazon.com|Amazon]] page for Tuscan whole milk was covered by ''[[The New York Times]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.nytimes.com/2006/08/09/technology/09milk.html?_r=1&amp;scp=1&amp;sq=pogue%20tuscan%20amazin&amp;st=cse | work=The New York Times | title=On Amazon, All of a Sudden Everyone's a Milk Critic | date=2006-08-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

YTMND was featured in an article for the July 30, 2006, issue of ''[[The Washington Post]]''. The article describes how Goldberg conceived yourethemannowdog.com, its rise in popularity, and the elements of a YTMND site. The article also referred to the creators of YTMNDs as "artists".&lt;ref name="Ahrens"&gt;Ahrens, Frank "[https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/07/29/AR2006072900041.html A Home For Quick Hits]", Page F07 ''[[The Washington Post]]'', July 30, 2006&lt;/ref&gt; Goldberg signed a release for ''[[The Colbert Report]]'' to show [[Stephen Colbert]]-related YTMNDs.&lt;ref name="Colbert"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.ytmnd.com/news/?news_id=47 | title=Mo money mo problems | publisher=YTMND | date=2006-08-22 | accessdate=2006-08-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; A select few seconds of a YTMND was shown.{{Citation needed|date=April 2007}} On November 23, ''The Washington Post'' reported on telemarketing pranks in which they named a number of websites, including howtoprankatelemarketer.ytmnd.com.&lt;ref name="Washington Post"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/11/23/AR2006112300385.html |title=Fed up with telemarketers?

The '''Istanbul Archaeology Museums''' ({{lang-tr|{{italics correction|İstanbul Arkeoloji Müzeleri}}}}) is a group of three archeological museums located in the [[Eminönü]] district of [[Istanbul]], [[Turkey]], near [[Gülhane Park]] and [[Topkapı Palace]].

The Istanbul Archaeology Museums consists of three museums: 
#'''Archaeological Museum''' (in the main building)
#'''Museum of the Ancient Orient'''
#'''Museum of Islamic Art''' (in the [[Tiled Kiosk]]).

It houses over one million objects that represent almost all of the eras and civilizations in world history.

==Background==
In the 19th century, efforts were in place to modernize the [[Ottoman Empire]], as many of the leading statesmen were exposed to Westernizing ideas through education and travel. The proposal to have an imperial museum came about because of the familiarity of several key players in the [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] political scene with the [[Louvre]] in [[Paris]].&lt;ref name="hurriyetdailynews1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hurriyetdailynews.com/n.php?n=istanbul-archaeology-museum-turning-120-2011-06-26|title=ARTS-CULTURE - Istanbul Archaeology Museum turning 120 |work=[[Hürriyet Daily News]]|date=June 26, 2011|accessdate=February 20, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Ottoman sultan [[Abdülaziz]] (r. 1861–1876) was impressed by the archaeological museums in [[Paris]] (30 June – 10 July 1867),&lt;ref name=AbdulazizVoyage/&gt; [[London]] (12–23 July 1867)&lt;ref name=AbdulazizVoyage/&gt; and [[Vienna]] (28–30 July 1867)&lt;ref name=AbdulazizVoyage/&gt; which he visited in the summer of 1867,&lt;ref name="AbdulazizVoyage"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://blog.milliyet.com.tr/sultan-abdulaziz---avrupa-seyahati/Blog/?BlogNo=367847|title=Sultan Abdülaziz - Avrupa Seyahati/Tarih/milliyet blog|work=blog.milliyet.com.tr|access-date=2018-02-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; and ordered a similar archaeological museum to be established in Istanbul. The decision to establish an Imperial Museum under the Education Ministry came in 1869 with the appointment of a new director, but the idea of a museum was dropped with his resignation and because of budget restraints.

As education minister in 1872, [[Ahmet Vefik Pasha]] set up a museum directorship for the second time and hired the [[Germany|German]] historian, archaeologist, epigraphist and painter, Dr. Phillip Anton Dethier. He proved to be so successful at collecting materials that the idea of a purpose-built museum gained traction.

When Dethier died in 1881, [[Painting|painter]] and [[archaeologist]] [[Osman Hamdi Bey]] was appointed to the position that same year.

==History==
[[Image:Osman Hamdi Bey bust March 2008.JPG|thumb|left|Bust and memorial plaque to [[Osman Hamdi Bey]] in the foyer of the main building]]
The site of the museums belonged to the [[Topkapı Palace]] outer gardens. The museum was founded by decree as the Imperial Museum ({{lang-ota|Müze-i Hümayun}} or {{lang-tr|İmparatorluk Müzesi}}) in 1891. The first [[curator]] and founder of the museum was [[Osman Hamdi Bey]]. Since an imperial decree protecting cultural goods in the Ottoman Empire was enforced, many governors from the provinces would send in found artefacts to the capital city. In that way the museum was able to amass a great collection. Upon its 100th anniversary in 1991, the museum received the [[European Council]] Museum Award, particularly for the renovations made to the lower floor halls in the main building and the new displays in the other buildings.

The construction of the main building was started by [[Osman Hamdi Bey]] in 1881, attaining its present neo-Greek form in 1908. The architect was [[Alexander Vallaury]] (who also designed the [[Pera Palace Hotel]] in Istanbul). The facade of the building was inspired by the [[Alexander Sarcophagus]] and Sarcophagus of the Mourning Women, both housed inside the Museum.  It is one of the prominent structures built in the [[Neoclassical architecture|neoclassical]] style in Istanbul.

The '''Museum of the Ancient Orient''' was commissioned by Osman Hamdi Bey in 1883 as a fine arts school. Then it was reorganised as a museum, which opened in 1935. It was closed to visitors in 1963, and reopened in 1974 after restoration works on the interior.

The '''[[Tiled Kiosk]]''' was commissioned by Sultan [[Mehmed II]] in 1472. It is one of the oldest structures in Istanbul featuring [[Ottoman architecture|Ottoman]] civil architecture, and was a part of the Topkapı Palace outer gardens. It was used as the Imperial Museum between 1875 and 1891 before the collection moved to the newly constructed main building. It was opened to public in 1953 as a museum of Turkish and Islamic art, and was later incorporated into the Istanbul Archaeology Museum.

==Hours of operation, admittance fee==
The museum is open to the public from 09:00 to 19:00, with ticket sales halting an hour before closing time; tickets are 20 TL.   Closed on Mondays.
