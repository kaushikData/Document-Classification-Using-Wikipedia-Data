'''''A Protocol of 1919''''' is a [[Antisemitic canard|fabricated text]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2006/09/060911-zion.html |title=Anti-Semitic "Protocols of Zion" Endure, Despite Debunking |last1=Handwerk |first1=Brian |date=September 11, 2006 |website=National Geographic News |access-date=27 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; appearing in the appendices of ''[[The Protocols of the Elders of Zion]]'', purportedly found on 9 December 1919 among the documents of a Jewish Red battalion commander killed in the [[Estonian War of Independence]]. The document's supposed authors, the "Israelite International League", gloat over their success at reducing the Russian people to "helpless slaves", and urge their fellow Jews to "excite hatred" and "buy up Government loans and gold", in order to grow in "political and economic power and influence". The text has been cited, as with other antisemitic canards, as evidence for the [[antisemitic]] belief that the Jews are conspiring to take over the world.

==History==
''A Protocol of 1919'' was first published in the [[Estonia]]n newspaper ''[[Postimees]]'' (morning edition) on 31 December 1919. ''Postimees'' detailed how the originally [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]] text was found from the pocket of Shunderev, a Jewish [[Bolshevik]] battalion commander in the 11th Rifle Regiment who had been killed in action on the night before December 9.&lt;ref&gt;"Vene enamlust juhib juutide üleilmne salaliit". ''Postimees''. 31 December 1919. Issue 290. p.1 - [http://dea.nlib.ee/index.php?lid=72&amp;byea=1919&amp;bmon=12 Digitalized Estonian Newspapers]&lt;/ref&gt; At the time, ''Postimees'' was owned by [[Jaan Tõnisson]], an Estonian nationalist politician.

The text appeared next on 5 February 1920 in ''[[Prizyv]]'', a Russian newspaper in Berlin. ''Prizvy'' described it as "an interesting document". Later it was reproduced in the appendix of a greatly expanded English-language edition of ''The Protocols of the Elders of Zion'', published in 1934 by the [[Patriotic Publishing Co.]], operating from a [[post office box]] in [[Chicago, Illinois]].&lt;ref name=zion&gt;''The Protocols of the Meetings of the Learned Elders of Zion – with Preface and Explanatory Notes'' (trans. [[Victor E. Marsden]]). Chicago: The Patriotic Publishing Co. 1934. Hosted [http://ddickerson.igc.org/The_Protocols_of_the_Learned_Elders_of_Zion.pdf online] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140729103854/http://ddickerson.igc.org/The_Protocols_of_the_Learned_Elders_of_Zion.pdf |date=29 July 2014 }} by David Dickerson, Institute for Global Communications.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Walter Laqueur]], an American historian, states that "the German right-wing extremist press was supplied for years with information first published in ''Prizyv'' during its nine months of existence", and points to ''A Protocol of 1919'' as a "typical" example.&lt;ref&gt;Laqueur, Walter (1965). [https://books.google.com/books?id=5madOAUfKZUC&amp;pg=PA131 ''Russia and Germany: A Century of Conflict'']. Transaction Publishers. p. 131. {{ISBN|0887383491}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Content==
The document consists of eleven short paragraphs of vague antisemitic generalizations, with eight admonitions to be "careful" or "cautious", and is signed by "The Central Committee of the Petersburg Branch of the Israelite International League".

'''''Aces Go Places 5: The Terracotta Hit''''' is a 1989 Hong Kong action comedy film directed by [[Lau Kar-leung]] with [[stage combat|action choreography]] by [[Lau Kar-wing]]. This is the fifth and final installment in the [[Aces Go Places (film series)|''Aces Go Places'' film series]]. It was released in the United States as '''''Mad Mission 5: The Terracotta Hit'''''.

==Plot==
King Kong and Baldy, the "Aces," part ways in 1986 after a mission in Thailand to kidnap a woman on her way to marry her boyfriend (a rich man claiming to be her husband enlisted the Aces' services) goes sour. Three years later, figures from the famous [[Terracotta Army]] and a [[Qing Dynasty]] bronze sword called the "Chinese [[Excalibur]]" is stolen during their transport to an exhibition in Hong Kong. Based on pictures that appear in the media, the two men are accused of the heist. By this time, King Kong is running an investment company that has long since been in the red, and Baldy - who sent his wife and son to Canada - is hiding in a [[Sai Kung]] houseboat from creditors who lent him money to invest in the stock market.

When a muscular [[Ministry of State Security of the People's Republic of China|MSS]] operative called the Chinese Rambo separately visits Baldy and King Kong (with indirect approval from the [[Hong Kong Police Force]] command, who have long since disowned them), both men decide to find those who framed them to clear their names. 

They discover that a brother-sister tandem calling themselves the "New Aces" took the pictures during the heist and wore face masks of the two men's likenesses while getting away with stealing the Chinese Excalibur. They interrogate them inside Baldy's houseboat, and as the siblings try to escape, they plunge into the water and go back to the house during which a Chinese ship tows the houseboat. All four of them are sent to Beijing and imprisoned to answer for the crime. They are forced to undergo a staged execution until the Chinese Rambo offers them a chance to get out of prison in exchange for helping the Chinese government recover the figures. The four Aces agree to help recover the figures from the White Gloves syndicate. They begin training in martial arts because Beijing specifically orders that the figures must not be damaged by any means.  However, the Chinese Rambo calls off the training, explaining that the Chinese government will try to get the figures back through diplomatic means.

Despite the turn of events, the four Aces band together and proceed with the mission. A furious battle inside the White Gloves' hideout, which even involves the use of the Chinese Excalibur, results in the quartet recovering the figures. King Kong, Baldy, and the New Aces join the Hong Kong police in sending off the Chinese Rambo, who is safeguarding the shipment back to China.

It uses the ''[[Bible|Bible's]]'', "[[Parable of the Sower]]," and, "[[Parable of the Prodigal Son]]," to tell the story of a colony of ants and the misadventures of a particular ant named Antony.  Antony's story was continued in the sequel titled ''[[Ants'hillvania II: The Honeydew Adventure]]''.

Featuring:
*Antony: [[Wendell Burton]] 
*CommandAnt: [[Pat Boone]]
*Millicent Millipede: [[Jamie Owens-Collins]]
*Story teller: [[James Hampton (actor)|James Hampton]]

==Plot==
The track tells the story of an [[ant colony]] in a beautiful forest called Ants'hillvania (a pun on [[Pennsylvania]]). The colony is filled with kind, fun-loving, and virtuous ants, led by their village leader, the CommandAnt. The ants value work and each other, and live by "the Wisdom from Above", or in other words, the word of God, which keeps their colony together through hard times.

However, the CommandAnt's young teenage son, Antony, is restless and tired of the same old settings of his life, and strives to explore the world and become rich and famous without expending labor and looking out for number one. The CommandAnt, though disappointed with this change of events, gives Antony his trust and gives his son his [[inheritance]].

Antony sets out on a journey through the wood. Two of his friends, Briant and Samanttha, join him in his quest, and throughout their journey, they learn the meaning of what is right and more about the Wisdom from Above.

'''Bal Bullier''' was a ballroom in [[Paris]], [[France]], created by [[François Bullier]] in the mid-nineteenth century. It closed its doors in 1940. It was located at 39 Avenue [[Georges Bernanos]] in the district of [[Val-de-Grâce|Val-de-Grace]] in the [[5th arrondissement of Paris|5th arrondissement]], at the location of Bullier Centre [[Centre régional des œuvres universitaires et scolaires|CROUS]]. The entrance fee was two francs on Thursday nights, and one franc on Saturday nights.{{sfn|Eastman|Mayer|1899|p=151}} 

[[Sonia Delaunay]]'s ''Bal Bullier'' is a painting known for both its use of color and movement. The original Bullier Hall was located on the Avenue de l'Observatoire and was popular for dancing and drinking. Described by [[Malcolm Cowley]] as "very Western Hall", in the 1930s, it was favored for political meetings.{{sfn|Fitch|1992|p=118}}

'''Bertram David Lewin''' (1896-1971) was an American [[psychoanalyst]] who was both an acute clinician and a contributor to theory, particularly to the study of [[Hypermania|elation]], and of the dream screen.

==Training and contributions==
Lewin had a training analysis with [[Franz Alexander]] in Berlin in the 1920s, before publishing his first analytic article in 1930.  This was followed by ten more over the next decade, on subjects ranging from diabetes and [[claustrophobia]] to the body as [[phallus]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Otto Fenichel]], ''The Psychoanalytic Theory of Neurosis'' (1946) p. 636&lt;/ref&gt;  The main focus of his interest, however, was in manic states, which he saw as characterised by fleeting identifications with a multiple of outside figures.&lt;ref&gt;Otto Fenichel, ''The Psychoanalytic Theory of Neurosis'' (1946) p. 408&lt;/ref&gt;

After the war, he published the fruits of his investigations in ''The Psychoanalysis of Elation'' (1951).  There he stressed the role of [[denial]] in mania – denial particularly of feelings of separation and loss.&lt;ref&gt;S. M. Skubal, ''Word of Mouth'' (2013) p. 35-6&lt;/ref&gt;  He also explored the paradox in elation's dark counterpart, depression, whereby the melancholic in seeking to punish the effigy of their loved one in fact punishes themselves having incorporated this effigy.&lt;ref&gt;[[Darian Leader]], ''The New Black'' (2008) p. 55&lt;/ref&gt;

By that point he had also published his seminal article (1946) on the dream screen – the backcloth formed from primitive memories of the breast onto which the dream is projected.&lt;ref&gt;L. Fischer, ''Shot/Countershot'' (2014) p. 78&lt;/ref&gt;  The concept would be fruitfully followed up both within analysis,&lt;ref&gt;J. Pearson, ''Analyst of the Imagination'' (2004) p. 62&lt;/ref&gt; and in the context of [[film theory]].&lt;ref&gt;L. Fischer, ''Cinematernity'' (2014) p. 25&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Congo African Grey pet on a perch.JPG|right|249px|thumb|[[Grey parrot]] on top of its cage.]]
A '''companion parrot''' is a [[parrot]] kept as a [[pet]] that interacts abundantly with their [[human]] counterpart. Generally, most species of parrot can make excellent companions.

Species of parrots that are kept as companions include large parrots, such as [[Amazon parrot|amazons]], [[grey parrot|greys]], [[cockatoo]]s, [[Eclectus parrot|eclectus]], [[Red-fan parrot|hawk-headed parrots]], and [[macaw]]s; mid-sized birds, such as [[caique]]s, [[conure]]s, [[monk parakeet|quakers]], ''[[Pionus]]'', ''[[Poicephalus]]'', [[rose-ringed parakeet]]s, and [[rosella]]s; and many of the smaller types, including ''[[Brotogeris]]'', [[Budgerigar|budgies]], [[cockatiel]]s, [[parakeets]], [[lovebird]]s, [[parrotlet]]s and [[Barred parakeet|lineolated parakeet]]s.

Some species of [[lories and lorikeets]] are kept as pets but are quite messy, and often more popular as [[aviary]] birds. [[Hanging parrot]]s and [[fig parrot]]s are normally kept as aviary birds and not as pets. Some species as [[pygmy parrot]]s and [[kakapo]]s, [[night parrot]]s, and about half of the species of parrotlet, are not considered companion parrots due to difficult dietary requirements or unavailability.

The ''Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora'' (also known as [[CITES]]) has made the trapping and trade of all wild parrots illegal, because taking parrots from the wild has endangered or reduced some of the rarer or more valuable species. However, many parrot species are still common; some abundant parrot species may still be legally killed as crop pests in their native countries.
[[Endangered species|Endangered]] parrot species are better suited to [[Conservation biology|conservation]] breeding programs than as companions.

==Maintenance==
[[Image:Black-headed Caique (Pionites melanocephalus) -cage bars.jpg|left|thumb|[[Black-headed parrot|Black-headed caique]] in its cage]]
With the right home parrots have the potential to make excellent, highly interactive, affectionate, and entertaining pets prized by their owners, but should not be considered easy care or low-maintenance pets. Tame companion parrots require daily attention and interaction with their owners, and need to be housed in a cage at least large enough to allow the bird to spread its wings and move about comfortably. Companion parrots also need to be fed a diet that includes fresh vegetables and fruits, and a smaller amount of seeds and grains; dietary requirements vary with species and activity level. Other elements essential to a companion parrot's well-being include appropriate toys to chew up and play with; veterinary care; and social time out of the cage whenever possible — preferably on playgyms or other out-of-cage perches. The larger parrots can be expensive to care for, messy, destructive, and loud, and some individuals may exhibit some aggressive behaviors during adolescence. Like dogs, parrots require some amount of basic training and proper early socialization to mature into good companions. Their intelligence means parrots learn new behaviors — both good and bad — easily. Many birds end up having to be re-homed because their owners did not realize the level of care required when they purchased the bird, did not understand how loud they can be, or did not understand how to properly socialize and train their bird. This is especially true for macaws and other species with dramatic, beautiful colouring, as well as cockatoos due to their intensely affectionate demeanor. These traits unfortunately make them tempting impulse purchases, leading to hundreds of macaws and cockatoos being put up for adoption.

===Pellets &amp; formulated diets===
In more recent years, pellets or formulated diets have become very popular, especially in the US. They offer an advantage over a seed-based diet in that a parrot cannot pick out and eat only its favorite (usually fatty) seeds.  The majority of avian veterinarians will recommend a pelleted or formulated diet, and will extensively discuss with owners what their bird should and should not eat&lt;ref&gt;Laurie Hess, DVM, Diplomate ABVP (Avian Practice) [http://www.birdchannel.com/bird-diet-and-health/bird-care/what-to-expect-from-your-avian-vet.aspx "What To Expect From Your Avian Vet"].&lt;/ref&gt; However, although these offer an easy alternative to other foods, they are not the best for many species.{{citation needed|date=August 2011}} Many pellets contain artificial food dyes and preservatives that may be harmful{{citation needed|date=December 2010}}; however there are "no-color-added" options available on the market.&lt;ref&gt;Susan Chamberlain [http://www.birdchannel.com/bird-diet-and-health/bird-nutrition/polly-doesnt-want-cracker.aspx "The Truth Behind Popular Pet Bird Food Myths"]&lt;/ref&gt; Most pellets contain soy, which is not a part of a parrot's natural diet; however, the diet of wild parrots cannot be replicated in captivity. Avian veterinarians and nutritionists agree the pelleted and formulated diets are the best base diet for pet birds. Although pellets may be advertised as a "complete diet," there are dozens of species of parrots commonly kept as pets, all with varying nutritional needs.&lt;ref&gt;Donald J. Brightsmith &amp; Debra McDonald.

Retrieved on 2009-12-17.&lt;/ref&gt; A common mistake made by owners feeding pellets is over-supplementing them with fresh food. As a pellet is, essentially, a supplemented grain, supplementing them even more "dilutes" the diet, making the pellets less efficient and the diet unbalanced.&lt;ref&gt;Malcolm Green. [http://www.birdcareco.com/English/Arts/Pet_arts/PelletsOrSeed/POS.html "Pellets - Yes or No"].

Parrots can be very rewarding pets to the right owners, due to their intelligence and desire to interact with people. Many parrots are very affectionate, even cuddly with trusted people, and require a lot of attention from their owners constantly. Some species have a tendency to bond to one or two people, and dislike strangers, unless they are regularly and consistently handled by different people. Properly socialized parrots can be friendly, outgoing and confident companions.
Most pet parrots take readily to trick training. Trick training can also help to redirect a bird's energy and prevent or correct many behavior problems. Some owners successfully use well behaved parrots as therapy animals. Some owners have trained their parrots to wear [[parrot harness]]es (most easily accomplished with young birds) so that they can be taken to enjoy themselves outdoors in a relatively safe manner without the risk of flying away.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://theparrotforum.com/viewtopic.php?f=15&amp;t=1329 | title=Flight Harness Training Parrot | accessdate= 5 November 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Parrots are prey animals and even the tamest pet may fly off if spooked.

Although parrots can be messy pets—often throwing food and damaging furniture with their beaks if they can—most parrots may be potty trained to some extent and are generally odorless; however, certain species of ''[[Amazona]]'' and ''[[Pionus]]'' have a distinctive odor most owners find pleasant. Most parrot species, with some notable exceptions, are relatively good pets for most pet allergy sufferers. However, all the species of white cockatoos produce large quantities of dust from their [[powder down]] feathers, which may be problematic for people with allergies. Cockatiels, rose-breasted cockatoos, and greys also produce smaller amounts of feather dust.

==Behavior==
[[Image:Scarlet Macaw (Ara macao) -chewing wood.jpg|left|thumb|A [[scarlet macaw]] chewing wood]]
Different species (sometimes even different individuals within species) can vary greatly in temperament, noise, and talking ability. For example, ''Pionus'' parrots generally have a reserved stance, while at the other end, large cockatoos need at least several hours of attention daily. The upbringing and genetic inclination of an individual bird plays a major role in determining its disposition, regardless of species.

Many of the larger parrots are unsuitable in an apartment setting due to noise level. Although all parrots will make some noise, species that are generally less noisy include parrotlets, budgies, cockatiels, ''[[Pyrrhura]]'' [[conures]], ''Pionus'', caiques, greys, and usually ''Poicephalus''. Many of the other species of [[conures]] can be loud birds. [[Cockatoos]], and many macaws and amazon parrots can be very loud, though normally only at certain times of the day and some birds will learn to scream for attention.

Many people are initially attracted to parrots for their ability to talk, sing, and mimic noises they are exposed to. Some parrot species such as greys, eclectus, quaker parrots, male budgies, and some species of amazon parrots, macaws, and [[Psittacula]] are frequently good talkers and mimickers, although there is no guarantee that any individual parrot will talk. Many parrots learn to use words in context; for example, calling family members by name, or requesting certain food items by name. Other species are poor talkers, but popular for their affectionate or playful personalities.

Budgies, cockatiels, lovebirds, and parrotlets have been bred in captivity the longest and are popular and readily available in many color mutations; by some definitions they are domesticated. These species make up the vast majority of individual parrots kept as pets. Although small parrots are generally much easier to care for than larger species, they are still intelligent birds that need attention and interaction. Budgies have been bred as pets for over 150 years, exist in two distinct breeds (American and English), and generally have excellent pet qualities. Many new owners are surprised at how affectionate and interactive even these small parrots can be once they are tamed.

Parrots need a cage large enough to exercise in, stretch their wings, and climb if it will not be out for a good part of the day. Without exercise, parrots tend to become obese and unhealthy.

Toys (enrichment) are necessary for pet parrots. Different birds may have very different toy preferences. Toys should be sized appropriately for the bird's size and destructiveness; for example, a small plastic budgie toy could be dangerous for a large parrot that could break off and ingest a piece. Some birds may prefer wooden toys to chew up; some may prefer bells or other toys that make noise; some may prefer toys with leather strips they can untie; some may prefer a bowl of small 'foot toys' they can throw around. Some birds may destroy their toys quickly. Although commercial bird toys can be expensive, it is possible for owners to save money by making their own toys and providing other items such as cardboard, blocks of wood, pine cones, or freshly cut branches from non-toxic trees for a parrot to chew on and play with.

[[File:Macaw bite.jpg|thumb|left|Bite wounds inflicted by a pet [[blue-and-yellow macaw]]]]
Parrots use their hooked beaks to help them to climb around, as well as to shell seeds and nuts. It is normal for a parrot to use its beak to explore and to get around; it is common, for example, for a parrot to rest its beak on a person's hand to steady itself as it steps up. Many parrots also like to gently beak or attempt to preen their owner's hands. However, even tame parrots can bite humans, particularly if confused or frightened, so it is wise to keep larger birds caged around small children they are not familiar with. Large parrots such as macaws and cockatoos have powerful beaks designed for crushing large nuts. It is generally not recommended to have any large parrot on the shoulder, because it is difficult to observe the parrot there for warning signs prior to a bite, and it is also easier for a parrot to slip and bite to catch itself. A large parrot bite to the face can do severe damage and destroy the trust between owner and bird. Often bites are not intentional; for example, if the bird slips from the owner's shoulder, it is likely to try to grab the nearest thing to hold on to, which may well be part of the owner's face.

==Household settings==

While many parrot species do well with well-behaved children, and can be excellent family pets, they are generally not a good ''child's'' pet due to their potential lifespan and care required. Parrots require consistent daily care and attention and are also longer lived than most other companion animals. Lifespans range from around 15 years for a budgie or lovebird, to 20–30 years for a cockatiel or small conure, up to 80 to 100 years for amazons and macaws—although a more reasonable lifespan for larger parrots is estimated at 50–60 years. Additionally, a young child could unintentionally injure a small bird such as a budgie; some parrots unaccustomed to children may find the high energy level and noise of a young child threatening and may bite. The bite strength of larger birds such as Macaws can be very dangerous and is well in excess of even a pit bull dog (375 psi compare to 275 psi).&lt;ref&gt;Dr. Brady Barr of National Geographic, Dangerous Encounters: Bite Force&lt;/ref&gt; Parrots that have been raised and socialized around children from a young age typically do much better with children than parrots who are introduced to children at a later age. Households that are suitable for pet parrots are said to be "[[bird-safe]]".

==Adoption==
[[Image:Umbrella cockatoo chicks 31l07.JPG|left|thumb|Hand reared [[umbrella cockatoo]] chicks]]
There is a small industry in breeding parrots for the pet trade. Breeders may range from small hobby breeders caring for just a pair or two to large breeding farms that may house hundreds of pairs. When chicks are small, breeders may put a specially made closed [[Bird ringing|bird ring]] (bird band) on one of their legs with identifying characters stamped into the plastic. A closed ring would not fit over the foot of an adult parrot, so its presence proves that the bird was banded when it was a young chick. Some breeders leave the chicks in the nest longer and thus have to use an open band on the bird's leg. However, some breeders do not band the smaller commonly bred parrots, and some owners may have their bird's band removed after purchase because of the possibility that a band might become caught on a toy or other object and cause injury (removal of a band should be done by a veterinarian or experienced person). Bands are the main method for identifying an individual bird, which is helpful if the bird is lost. Sometimes the larger and more expensive parrots are micro-chipped with a tiny security device, as well as being tagged with a leg ring.

Places for young parrots include breeders and specialty bird stores that ensure the chicks are healthy, well socialized with people and raised properly. Before being taken to a new home, hand-reared chicks will be fully fledged (have been allowed to learn to fly), can crack nuts and seeds for themselves, and will have been fully weaned from semisolid hand-rearing food (or fed by its parents) to an appropriate diet. Some breeders will additionally accustom their young parrots to different experiences, such as harness-training, traveling, and handling by a variety of people including children, taking advantage of this impressionable period of development.

Adult parrots that are rehomed by their owners or offered for adoption from a parrot shelter often make excellent pets after they adjust to a new home. Some of these, however, may have been neglected or abused in the past, and may do best with an experienced parrot owner. The rehoming of a companion parrot, in most cases, can be avoided by doing enough research before acquiring one and determining whether the potential buyer has a lifestyle that suits the species he/she is considering, and choosing a bird that is most compatible with the human's lifestyle. Owners also consider potential lifespan when selecting a species, and make appropriate arrangements if the bird is likely to outlive the owner.

'''''Crash of the Titans''''' is a [[platform game]] developed by [[Radical Entertainment]] and published by [[Vivendi Games]] for the [[PlayStation 2]], [[PlayStation Portable]] ([[Porting|ported]] by [[SuperVillain Studios]]), [[Wii]] and [[Xbox 360]]. The [[Game Boy Advance]] and [[Nintendo DS]] versions of the game were developed by [[Amaze Entertainment]]. The game was first released in North America on October 3, 2007,&lt;ref name="GameSpot"/&gt; in Europe on October 12, 2007&lt;ref name="IGNPreview"/&gt; and in Australia on October 25, 2007.&lt;ref name="IGNPreview"/&gt; It is the first game in the ''[[Crash Bandicoot (series)|Crash Bandicoot]]'' series not to have a Japanese release.

''Crash of the Titans'' is the fourteenth installment in the ''Crash Bandicoot'' video game series, the sixth game in the main franchise, and the first in the ''Mutant'' subseries. The game's story centers on the discovery of a substance known as "Mojo", which the antagonist of the series, [[Doctor Neo Cortex]], plans to use to turn the inhabitants of the Wumpa Islands into an army of loyal mutants known as "Titans". The protagonist of the series, [[Crash Bandicoot (character)|Crash Bandicoot]], must stop Cortex by using the technique of "jacking" to take control of and destroy Cortex's Titans while collecting the mojo.

The game received mixed reviews upon its release, while the DS version received favourable reception. Critics disparaged the game's short length, and although the game's variety was generally seen positively, reviewers noted little outstanding in the game. Despite this mediocre reception, the game was nominated for two awards.

==Gameplay==
''Crash of the Titans'' is a beat-em-up game with platforming aspects in which the player controls [[Crash Bandicoot (character)|Crash Bandicoot]], whose main objective is to rescue his sister, [[Coco Bandicoot|Coco]], and save his home, the Wumpa Island, from being destroyed by the main antagonist's gigantic robot.&lt;ref name="Instructions4"&gt;{{cite book |author=Radical Entertainment |title=Crash of the Titans American instruction manual (Wii)|date=2007-10-04 |publisher=Sierra Entertainment|page=4 |chapter=How to Play }}&lt;/ref&gt; The player's first goal is to rescue the sentient mask [[Aku Aku (character)|Aku Aku]], who gives the player basic instructions, shields Crash from enemy attacks, and transforms into a skateboard to help Crash traverse slippery terrain.&lt;ref name="Instructions4"/&gt; From there, each [[Level (video gaming)|level]] (known as an "episode") asks players to complete fights against large groups of enemies or simply progress through the episode.&lt;ref name="Instructions4"/&gt;

Crash starts the game with four [[Health (game mechanic)#Icon-based|lives]].&lt;ref name="Instructions4"/&gt; The length of each of Crash's lives is tied to his [[Health (gaming)|health meter]], which decreases whenever Crash is damaged from enemy attacks or falls down a bottomless pit.&lt;ref name="InstructionsScreen"&gt;{{cite book |author=Radical Entertainment |editor= |others= |title=Crash of the Titans American instruction manual (Wii) |date=2007-10-04 |publisher=Sierra Entertainment  |page=5 |chapter=The Game Screen}}&lt;/ref&gt; The player can replenish Crash's health meter by instructing Crash to eat Wumpa Fruit.&lt;ref name="InstructionsScreen"/&gt; Each time the health meter is fully depleted, Crash loses a life. However, the player can win an additional life for Crash by collecting 25,000 units of the magical substance Mojo&lt;ref name="InstructionsUpgrades"&gt;{{cite book |author=Radical Entertainment  |title=Crash of the Titans American instruction manual (Wii) |date=2007-10-04 |publisher=Sierra Entertainment |page=6 |chapter=Upgrades}}&lt;/ref&gt; or by collecting a rare type of Golden Wumpa Fruit.&lt;ref name="InstructionsPowerUps"&gt;{{cite book |author=Radical Entertainment |editor= |others= |title=Crash of the Titans American instruction manual (Wii)|date=2007-10-04 |publisher=Sierra Entertainment |page=6 |chapter=Power-Ups }}&lt;/ref&gt; After the last life is lost, the player can continue playing by restarting the current episode.&lt;ref name="Instructions4"/&gt;

Each episode contains a portal leading to a simple mini-game arena, where the player must accomplish a task in a set time.  Generally the task involves collecting a specified quantity of Mojo, using an enemy animal's attacks to snipe targets, or simply defeating a select number of enemies.&lt;ref name="COTT at GameSpy"&gt;{{cite web |last=Lewis |first=Cameron |date=2007-10-04 |publisher=[[GameSpy]] |title=''Crash of the Titans'' (PlayStation 2: 2007) |url=http://uk.ps2.gamespy.com/playstation-2/crash-of-the-titans/825058p1.html |accessdate=2007-10-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the end of each episode, the player earns a rank of a bronze, silver, or gold voodoo doll;&lt;ref name="InstructionsEndLevel"&gt;{{cite book |author=Radical Entertainment |editor= |others= |title=Crash of the Titans American instruction manual (Wii) |date=2007-10-04 |publisher=Sierra Entertainment|page=5 |chapter=The End Level Screen }}&lt;/ref&gt; the rank can be improved by defeating a set number of minions, destroying three robotic toilets or inflicting a minimum number of consecutive hits in combat.&lt;ref name="InstructionsEndLevel"/&gt; All three tasks must be accomplished in an episode if a gold voodoo doll is to be obtained for that episode. Hidden voodoo dolls unlock concept art packages for each episode.&lt;ref name="InstructionsRewards"&gt;{{cite book |author=Radical Entertainment |editor= |others= |title=Crash of the Titans American instruction manual (Wii)|date=2007-10-04 |publisher=Sierra Entertainment|page=6 |chapter=Other Rewards }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Nintendo DS version of ''Crash of the Titans'' contains similar gameplay to that of previous ''Crash'' installments. The game takes place on four islands, each with two [[Level (video gaming)|levels]] and a [[Boss (video gaming)|boss]]. When a boss is defeated, a new island is unlocked.&lt;ref name="amazemania"&gt;{{cite web|publisher=Crash Mania |author=JumpButton |date=2007-07-12 |title=Crash Mania official interview with Amaze Entertainment |url=http://hpzr.freeweb7.com/interviewamaze.htm |accessdate=2007-07-13 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20070929103134/http://hpzr.freeweb7.com/interviewamaze.htm |archivedate=September 29, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Each island has its own "[[Pachinko]] board" where players can win "on-demand items"; items that can be used to restore health, provide temporary invincibility, and set off Nitro explosions among other things. Additional content can also be won at these Pachinko boards, such as gallery art, cheats and a large quantity of Mojo.&lt;ref name="amazemania"/&gt;

===Combat===
[[Image:Spikeparafox.jpg|thumb|left|Crash Bandicoot and "Carbon Crash" have jacked the Titans Snipe and Spike, respectively]]

Whereas the previous games featured Crash spinning into or jumping on an enemy to attack, ''Crash of the Titans'' gives him more options for attack. Early in the game, Crash has a light-powered attack and a heavy-powered attack and can also block, dodge or break an enemy's block.&lt;ref name="InstructionsGreatFighter"&gt;{{cite book |author=Radical Entertainment |editor= |others= |title=Crash of the Titans American instruction manual (Wii)|date=2007-10-04 |publisher=Sierra Entertainment|page=7 |chapter=How to be a Great Fighter }}&lt;/ref&gt; When he defeats an enemy or destroys an object, a magical substance known as Mojo is released.&lt;ref name="InstructionsUpgrades"/&gt; When Crash collects enough Mojo, he will earn either an ability upgrade or a new move, such as the [[Chuck Norris|Norris]] Roundhouse or the Triple Dragon.&lt;ref name="InstructionsUpgrades"/&gt; His classic spin attack, named "Old Skool", is an unlockable move, along with an aerial variant that allows Crash to float over chasms.&lt;ref name="firstlook"&gt;{{cite web |date=2007-04-20 |publisher=GameSpot |last=Shoemaker |first=Brad |title=''Crash of the Titans'' First Look |url=http://www.gamespot.com/wii/action/crashofthetitans/news.html?sid=6169477&amp;om_act=convert&amp;om_clk=newsfeatures&amp;tag=newsfeatures;title;1 |accessdate=2008-05-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While small minions require only a single [[Combo (gaming)|combo attack]] for Crash to defeat, larger enemies, known as "Titans", require more effort to subdue. Each of the fifteen unique Titans in the game possess a star meter that indicates how close they are to being stunned.&lt;ref name="firstlook"/&gt;&lt;ref name="InstructionsJackEnemy"&gt;{{cite book |author=Radical Entertainment |editor= |others= |title=Crash of the Titans American instruction manual (Wii)|date=2007-10-04 |publisher=Sierra Entertainment  |page=6 |chapter=How to Jack an Enemy }}&lt;/ref&gt; The meter rises when Crash starts attacking a Titan, and depletes when he stops.&lt;ref name="firstlook"/&gt; When it is full, the Titan is stunned and susceptible to "jacking", meaning Crash can mount the creature and control it.&lt;ref name="InstructionsJackEnemy"/&gt; While controlled by the player, the Titan possesses a similar moveset to Crash,&lt;ref name="firstlook"/&gt; although some jacked Titans can shoot projectiles.&lt;ref name="InstructionsControlling"&gt;{{cite book |author=Radical Entertainment  |title=Crash of the Titans American instruction manual (Wii)|date=2007-10-04 |publisher=Sierra Entertainment|page=7 |chapter=Controlling Enemies }}&lt;/ref&gt; Besides a greater health, the Titans controlled by Crash have a purple Titan Meter. When this meter is full, players can make the Titan unleash a special attack,&lt;ref name="InstructionsControlling"/&gt; which fully drains the meter in the process.

A Titan's durability depends on its size; larger Titans will take more effort to defeat than others and a few are immune to Crash's attacks. To defeat them, Crash has to jack a smaller Titan to fight them. On defeating the larger Titan, he can dismount the Titan he previously jacked and directly jack the larger Titan. The dismounted Titan will then be destroyed.

===Co-operative play===
A player using a second controller can join the game at any time in the form of a white-furred version of Crash known as "Carbon Crash".&lt;ref name="firstlook"/&gt;&lt;ref name="InstructionsMultiplayer"&gt;{{cite book |author=Radical Entertainment |title=Crash of the Titans American instruction manual (Wii)|date=2007-10-04 |publisher=Sierra Entertainment|page=8 |chapter=Multiplayer Co-op Mode }}&lt;/ref&gt; The second player appears in the first player's backpack, and can usually enter or exit the pack. However, the second player has to stay in the backpack if the first player is in mid-air or climbing a wall. This method of play is useful for overpowering enemies and collecting Mojo faster.  There are two modes of co-op play; in "Leapfrog Mode", the players swap control each time the front player jumps, swings, or slides, while in "Piggyback Mode", each player is equipped with their own backpack and can hide in the other player's backpack if the action becomes too intense, such as when jumping over a chasm.&lt;ref name="InstructionsMultiplayer"/&gt;

==Plot==

===Setting===
The setting of ''Crash of the Titans'' features twenty levels.&lt;ref name="firstlook"/&gt; Each level is referred to as an "episode", and each has a distinctive subtitle that is usually a reference to popular culture (such as "[[The Wizard of Oz (1939 film)|The Blizzard of Claws]]"). Like the first ''[[Crash Bandicoot (video game)|Crash Bandicoot]]'' game, episodes must be played in order, although the player can replay any episode that has been completed. The game moves through five major themes taking place on Crash's homeland, the Wumpa Islands. The story starts in the jungle near Crash's residence and leads to an ancient temple. Later in the game, Crash travels through a wood-cutting and mining area and a land flowing with lava that features giant steel mosquitoes sucking minerals out of the ground. The next few episodes take place on an artillery-bombarded beach, where Crash infiltrates [[Doctor N. Gin]]'s missile factory, which resembles the [[Statue of Liberty]]. The penultimate area is a gigantic tree located in the middle of the island. This tree holds up an entire house owned by Uka Uka, one of the major antagonists of the series. The final moments of the game take place in the antagonist's [[Liberace]]-style lair, and finally inside the Doominator.

Aiding Crash is [[Aku Aku (character)|Aku Aku]], an ancient wooden mask who acts as a shield, a skateboard, and a weapon. He can also  help Crash jack Titans. Crash's other two allies are his genius sister [[Coco Bandicoot]] and his muscular older brother, [[Crunch Bandicoot]], who is absent in the Nintendo DS version.

Doctor Neo Cortex is a [[mad scientist]] who captures Coco and Aku Aku and wants to use stolen Mojo to create an army of mutants. [[Uka Uka]], who is also absent in the Nintendo DS version, is behind Cortex's plot for world domination; after tiring of Cortex's incompetence, Uka replaces him with his cyborg niece, [[Nina Cortex]]. Aiding the Cortexes are [[Doctor N. Gin]], who is Cortex's hysterical right-hand man, and Tiny Tiger. [[Dingodile]], another minion of Cortex, exclusively appears in the DS and Game Boy Advance versions of ''Crash of the Titans'' as a boss character.&lt;ref name="amazemania"/&gt; Aiding the villains are a number of small fodder enemies that attempt to hinder Crash in his journey. Each fodder is affiliated with a certain villain in the game. The first fodders encountered are Neo Cortex's Ratnicians, which appear as bipedal, chihuahua-like animals dressed as laboratory researchers. These characters appear in the first four episodes of the game, and are replaced by other enemies as the game progresses. The later enemies include Tiny Tiger's Southern-accented Koo-alas, Doctor N. Gin's monkey wrench-wielding Doom Monkeys, Uka Uka's spear-chucking Voodoo Bunnies, and Nina Cortex's Brat Girls. [[Radical Entertainment]] sought to give these minor characters personalities by giving them a large number of distinctive quotations.&lt;ref name="radicalmania"/&gt;

===Story===
In the beginning of the game, Crash Bandicoot aids Coco with a butter-recycling device.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite video game |title=Crash of the Titans |developer=Radical Entertainment |publisher=Sierra Entertainment |date=2007-10-04 |platform=Wii |level=Episode 1: A New Hop |quote='''Coco Bandicoot:''' Crash!

The DS version of the game largely follows the story of the home console versions, but with minor alterations such as Nina Cortex having a greater role and the inclusion of [[Major characters of Crash Bandicoot#Dingodile|Dingodile]].&lt;ref name="amazemania"/&gt; Near the end of the game, Nina teams up with Crash to stop Doctor Cortex and his dancing "CortexBot". The Game Boy Advance version also includes Dingodile, some plot differences, such as the Arachnina (referred to by its old name, "Spiderbot") not being the last boss, and Cortex being reinstated after Nina's defeat in the N. Trapment Island.

==Development==
Development on ''Crash of the Titans'' began after the completion of ''[[Crash Tag Team Racing]]''.&lt;ref name="radicalmania"/&gt; The graphics of the [[Wii]] version of the game was one of [[Radical Entertainment]]'s main focuses in the game's development,&lt;ref name="IGNPreview"/&gt; with Radical stating that the [[Wii]] has "a lot of horsepower under the hood" and expressing their desire to make full use of it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |publisher=Codename Revolution |date=2007-03-02 |title=Wii has a lot of Horsepower says Radical |url=http://www.codenamerevolution.com/?p=4393 |accessdate=2007-07-13 |quote=The Wii has a lot of horsepower under the hood and we're making full use of it. We've overhauled our graphics engine to get the most out of the console by updating the shaders responsible for rendering the environment, vehicle, and characters. In many ways ''Scarface'' looks sharper on the Wii than it does on the PS2 and Xbox.}}&lt;/ref&gt; They also considered implementing a feature to connect the Wii to DS during gameplay, but stopped due to technical issues and time.&lt;ref name="amazemania"/&gt; The [[Xbox 360]] and [[PlayStation 2]] version got a few extra months of development time to improve its graphics before setting a final release date.&lt;ref name="eurogamer"&gt;{{cite web |publisher=Eurogamer |last=Reed |first=Kristan |date=2007-04-26 |title=Eurogamer's preview of ''Crash of the Titans'' |url=http://www.eurogamer.net/article.php?article_id=75703 |accessdate=2007-07-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While the game was being developed, the title's main character, Crash Bandicoot, became the new mascot of the [[Leukemia &amp; Lymphoma Society]]'s "School and Youth" programs in an effort to promote the battle against blood cancer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |publisher=GoNintendo |date=2007-08-06 |title=Video Game Hero Crash Bandicoot Urges Kids to Join the Fight Against Leukemia |url=http://gonintendo.com/?p=22481 |accessdate=2007-08-19 |quote=The Leukemia &amp; Lymphoma Society and Vivendi Games today announced that Crash Bandicoot is and will always be a classic, the valiant, action hero of the highly popular video game series, is the new national champion for the Societyfs School &amp; Youth programs.}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a bid to further promote the game, a [[Hummer]] (with a Wii inside) was painted with imagery from the game and displayed at the Annual Balloon Fiesta in [[Bristol]], United Kingdom.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=De Marco |first=Flynn |date=2007-08-12 |publisher=Kotaku |title=''Crash of the Titans'': The Hummer |url=http://kotaku.com/gaming/beer-and-tractor-pulls/crash-of-the-titans-the-hummer-288623.php |accessdate=2007-08-19 |quote=Has spinners, the works.

This special edition of the game features "Making-of" videos, water-on tattoos, game hints, a cheat code list, and the game's E3 and theatrical trailers in multiple languages. Due to its "mild cartoon violence and language", the game received a PG rating from the [[British Board of Film Classification|BBFC]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |publisher=[[British Board of Film Classification]] |date=2007-07-31 |title=''Crash of the Titans: Monster Edition'' rated PG by the BBFC |url=http://www.bbfc.co.uk/website/Classified.nsf/0/5710805319AAAE5080257329003EA50B?OpenDocument |accessdate=2007-09-13 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080106085324/http://www.bbfc.co.uk/website/Classified.nsf/0/5710805319AAAE5080257329003EA50B?OpenDocument |archivedate=2008-01-06 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Music===
Unlike ''[[Crash Tag Team Racing]]'', Radical did not hire the composer of the music in the previous ''Crash'' games, the [[a cappella]] band Spiralmouth whose members Rebecca Kneubuhl and Gabriel Mann left to compose musical pieces to ''[[The Legend of Spyro: The Eternal Night]]'' and ''[[The Legend of Spyro: Dawn of the Dragon]]'' from Crash's companion franchise ''[[Spyro the Dragon (series)|Spyro the Dragon]]'', to write the music for ''Crash of the Titans''. Instead, they assigned the job to their in-house composer Marc Baril, who took Spiralmouth's work on the previous games as references for ''Crash of the Titans''.&lt;ref name="radicalmania"/&gt; Radical Entertainment has expressed its pride with some of the music featured in the game, such as Doctor N. Gin's [[polka]] theme.&lt;ref name="radicalmania"/&gt; A 32-track soundtrack was made available on the [[iTunes Store#Music|iTunes Music Store]] on December 18, 2007.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |date=2007-12-18 |publisher=iTunes |title=''Crash of the Titans'' (Original Game Music Store) |url=http://phobos.apple.com/WebObjects/MZStore.woa/wa/viewAlbum?id=270102327&amp;s=143441 |accessdate=2008-05-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; The music in the Nintendo DS version of the game was created by Nathaniel Papadakis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Amaze Entertainment |title=Crash of the Titans American instruction manual (Nintendo DS) |year=2007 |publisher=Sierra Entertainment|page=8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Voice cast===
To avoid repetitive audio,&lt;ref name="firstlook"/&gt;&lt;ref name="eurogamer"/&gt; ''Crash of the Titans'' features more than 7,000 lines of dialogue,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |date=2007-07-12 |publisher=GameSpot |last=VanOrd |first=Kevin |title=E3 '07: ''Crash of the Titans'' Updated Impressions |url=http://www.gamespot.com/wii/action/crashofthetitans/news.html?sid=6174788&amp;om_act=convert&amp;om_clk=newsfeatures&amp;tag=newsfeatures;title;3 |accessdate=2008-05-10 |quote=It will feature more than 7,000 lines of dialogue from well-known voice actors, for starters, as well as the kind of silly humor you would expect from a Crash game.}}&lt;/ref&gt; many of which contain references to popular culture, such as the film ''[[Brokeback Mountain]]''.&lt;ref name="eurogamer"/&gt; To achieve a natural feel for their dialogue, the voice actors performed all their lines three times.&lt;ref name="kidzworld"&gt;{{cite web |publisher=Kidzworld |title=Making ''Crash of the Titans'' :: Inside Radical Entertainment (pg.2) |url=http://www.kidzworld.com/article/10243-inside-radical-entertainment-crash-of-the-titans-part-2 |accessdate=2008-05-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many of the voice actors from ''Crash Tag Team Racing'' reprised their roles, including [[Jess Harnell]] as Crash Bandicoot and [[Lex Lang]] as Doctor Neo Cortex. Characters who were regulars in the series but did not appear in ''Crash Tag Team Racing'' were given new voice actors for ''Crash of the Titans''. These replacements include [[Greg Eagles]] as Aku Aku, Chris Williams as Tiny Tiger, and [[John DiMaggio]] as Uka Uka. The DS version features full voice acting for cutscenes and in-game elements by some of the same voice actors from the home console version of the game, though some of the voice actors were substituted, such as Debi Derryberry in the role of Coco Bandicoot, and [[Nolan North]] in the role of N. Gin.&lt;ref name="amazemania"/&gt; Dingodile, who appears only in the DS and GBA versions, is voiced by Nolan North.

To make enemies memorable on their own;&lt;ref name="radicalmania"/&gt; Radical Entertainment scripted conversations between the enemy characters that can be overheard as the player approaches. Several voice actors provide the audio for the small enemies, including [[Tom Kenny]] from [[Nickelodeon (TV channel)|Nickelodeon]]'s ''[[SpongeBob SquarePants]]''.&lt;ref name="kidzworld"/&gt; Adding to the game's numerous pop-culture references, the voices and mannerisms of some of the characters are based upon those of real people, including [[Mike Tyson]], [[Mr. T]], [[Jerry Lewis]], and [[Peter Lorre]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |publisher=CAD Media |date=2007-11-07 |last=Mayo |first=Steven |title=Review - ''Crash of the Titans'' (Page 2) |url=http://www.cad-media.com/mediaitem.php?mid=552&amp;c=psp&amp;page=2 |accessdate=2008-06-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Crash of the Titans'' received mixed to average reviews upon its release, except for the DS version, which received positive reviews. [[GameSpot]] credited it as a "fairly sturdy, combat-heavy platformer with a good hook", but concluded that it lacked the distinctive style of past ''Crash Bandicoot'' games.&lt;ref name="Wii COTT at GameSpot"/&gt; The DS version of the game was reviewed positively, with [[IGN]] naming it "one of the better handheld Crash games to hit the market".&lt;ref name="DS COTT at IGN"/&gt; Nintendo World Report gave the DS version a higher score than the home console version by half a point, but dismissed it as "a short game that has very little gameplay variety".&lt;ref name="DS COTT at NWR"/&gt; GameSpot proclaimed that "there's plenty to do, and controlling the enemy is a neat twist", but criticized the game's small length of only six to eight hours.&lt;ref name="DS COTT at GameSpot"/&gt;

The more negative reviews include those from ''[[Nintendo Power]]'', who criticized the game for its "fixed and unforgiving" camera, which they felt made the platforming experience "frustrating".&lt;ref name="Wii COTT at Metacritic"/&gt; [[GameSpy]] also criticized the game for its camera along with its unsteady framerate, but praised the game's attractive graphics and offline co-op mode.&lt;ref name="COTT at GameSpy"/&gt; IGN described the game as "a good idea wrapped in a mediocre game", dismissing the game's music as "forgettable", and hoping that the jacking concept would be refined for a possible sequel.&lt;ref name="IGNWii"/&gt;&lt;ref name="IGN360"/&gt;&lt;ref name="IGNPS2"/&gt; [[Eurogamer]] was also critical of ''Crash of the Titans'', deriding its graphics as "designed primarily with the PS2 and Wii in mind, with a fairly lazy high-def makeover late in development".&lt;ref name="Eurogamer"/&gt; The PSP version received less praise than its console counterparts, with IGN remarking that it "loses out to the consoles in a number of areas; especially when it comes to multiplayer".&lt;ref name="PSP COTT at IGN"/&gt;

''Crash of the Titans'' was a nominee in the [[Writers Guild of America]]'s inaugural video game writing awards, competing against ''[[Dead Head Fred]]'', ''[[The Simpsons Game]]'', ''[[The Witcher (video game)|The Witcher]]'' and ''[[World in Conflict]]'';&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |publisher=Variety's Award Central |date=2008-01-14 |last=McNary |first=Dave |title=WGA announces videogame nominees |url=http://www.variety.com/awardcentral_article/VR1117979031.html?nav=news&amp;categoryid=1983&amp;cs=1 |accessdate=2008-01-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Dead Head Fred'' won the award.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Androvich |first=Mark |date=2008-02-15 |url=http://www.gamesindustry.biz/content_page.php?aid=33202 |title=''Dead Head Fred'' wins inaugural WGA award |publisher=gamesindustry.biz |accessdate=2008-02-15 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080218110816/http://www.gamesindustry.biz/content_page.php?aid=33202 |archivedate=February 18, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Grant |first=Christopher |date=2008-02-15 |url=http://www.joystiq.com/2008/02/15/dead-head-fred-wins-wgas-first-video-game-writing-award/ |title=''Dead Head Fred'' wins WGA's first Video Game Writing Award |publisher=joystiq.com |accessdate=2008-02-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Crash of the Titans'' was also selected as a nominee in the "Best Sound Design" and "Best Character" categories of the Second Annual Elan Awards.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|publisher=Radical Entertainment |title=Radical Entertainment News &amp; Updates |url=http://www.radical.ca/news.cfm |accessdate=2008-03-01 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080206234010/http://www.radical.ca/news.cfm |archivedate=2008-02-06 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; It lost both awards to ''[[Skate (video game)|Skate]]'' and ''[[Mass Effect]]''&lt;nowiki&gt;'&lt;/nowiki&gt;s [[Characters of Mass Effect#Commander Shepard|Commander Shepard]] respectively.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|publisher=The Elans |title=The 2nd Annual Elans Canadian Awards for the Electronic and the Animated Arts winners |url=http://theelans.com/Winners.html |accessdate=2008-03-01 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080312093236/http://theelans.com/Winners.html |archivedate=March 12, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Crusader: Adventure Out of Time''''', also known as ''Crusader: A Conspiracy in the Kingdom of Jerusalem'' is a 1997 video game, developed by [[Index+]] and published by [[Europress]]. The game was published for [[Microsoft Windows|Windows]], [[Windows 3.x]] and [[Mac OS X]].

== Gameplay ==
The game features 26 levels and is set in 1183, in the Kingdom of Jerusalem, at which time the relics of the Holy Cross are in danger. Videos of 20 actors are integrated into the computer graphics during gameplay.

== Development ==
A rearranged version of the game was released in 1999, as ''Crusaders 2000'', featuring new puzzles.

The game was not published in Russia.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://translate.google.com.au/translate?hl=en&amp;sl=ru&amp;u=http://questzone.ru/enzi/game/4094&amp;prev=search|title=Google Translate|website=translate.google.com.au|access-date=2018-02-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Cullen Gardens &amp; Miniature Village''' was a popular tourist attraction in [[Whitby, Ontario]], Canada. Officially opened in May 1980 by founder Len Cullen and his wife, Connie, the Gardens were a major tourist attraction in [[Whitby]] for 25 years.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.markcullen.com/news_events/cullen_gardens.htm MarkCullen.com: Cullen Gardens ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070122012941/http://www.markcullen.com/news_events/cullen_gardens.htm |date=January 22, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Features and attractions ==

Cullen Gardens combined the natural beauty of floral displays and gardens, along with a unique southern Ontario-themed miniature village.  The miniature village included many houses and [[Ridable miniature railway|trains]] that would travel around and between the houses. Other features included radio-controlled miniature boats. It was an entertaining attraction for both children and adults.  In 1983, the Miniature Village served as the filming location for an episode of the Canadian television series ''[[The Littlest Hobo]]'', entitled "Small Pleasures" (season 4, episode 16).

=== Festival of Lights ===

During the Winter holiday season, Cullen Gardens was host to the Festival of Lights, which featured huge displays of Christmas lights throughout the grounds, often decorating large topiaries.

== Closure and redevelopment==

On 1 January 2006, Cullen Gardens and Miniature Village closed. The land, however, has since been purchased by the Town of Whitby, to remain in the public domain as a [[municipal park]]. There has been speculation that the property may link up with the Heber Downs [[conservation area]]. At the time of its closure, the park was co-owned by Sue Cullen-Green and Bryan Green.

The miniature Village no longer exists at the site and the model buildings were sold to the nearby City of [[Oshawa]] for $234,000. Oshawa later put them up for sale again rather than opening an attraction of its own, citing budgetary austerity.&lt;ref&gt;"Oshawa will sell miniature village" October 17, 2007. [https://www.thestar.com/News/article/267665 TheStar.com - Toronto Edition], Retrieved July 15, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; The golf course formerly attached to Cullen Gardens continues to operate.

The miniature buildings were purchased by the [[Niagara Parks Commission]] in 2012. Many of the miniature buildings are now on display at the NPC's Botanical Gardens in Niagara Falls, Canada.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.niagarafrontier.com/greenhouse.html |title=Niagara Parks Commission Floral Showhouse |last1= |first1= |last2= |first2= |date=May 3, 2014 |website=Niagarafrontier.com |publisher= |accessdate=September 4, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In November 2011, the Town entered into a purchase and sale agreement with Auberge et Spa Le Nordik Inc. of [[Chelsea, Quebec]]. Le Nordik bought the main building and 3 hectares of land. They intend to use the main building and outdoor area to build a year-round heat therapy spa with two restaurants, a retail boutique and a small conference area. The remaining land was designated as open space and parkland, known as '''Cullen Central Park'''. The deal closed in 2013 and the spa was supposed to open in 2015.&lt;ref&gt;"Cullen revival imminent with Whitby spa development" June 27, 2013. As of September 2014, a park dedicated to fallen Canadian soldiers is now being constructed in Cullen Gardens. It was supposed to be done by November 2014.

'''Deaf Wrestlefest''' is a [[professional wrestling]] [[Card (sports)#Supercard|supercard]], produced annually in late April or early May by [[Ken Jugan|Lord Zoltan]], a longtime wrestler and sports promoter based in [[Western Pennsylvania]].&lt;ref name="Martin2010"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wrestleview.com/viewnews.php?id=1271099860 |title=Indy Update #2: BTPW, MPW, AWF, KSWA |author=Martin, Adam |date=April 12, 2010 |publisher=WrestleView |accessdate=July 29, 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121002220816/http://www.wrestleview.com/viewnews.php?id=1271099860 |archivedate=October 2, 2012 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Babinsack2010"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.f4wonline.com/component/content/article/13198 |title=Joe Babinsack talks Deaf Wrestlefest |author=Babinsack, Joe |date=May 2010 |work=Wrestling Observer/Figure Four Weekly |publisher=F4Wonline.com |accessdate=July 29, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is considered a major fundraiser for the [[Western Pennsylvania School for the Deaf]] and has raised, on average, between $3,000 and $4,000 per show. Proceeds from the event benefit Pennsylvania school programs to educate Deaf students.&lt;ref name="Barnes"&gt;{{cite news |title=Wrestlers perform to benefit school |author=Barnes, Jonathan |url=http://m.post-gazette.com/news/education/wrestlers-perform-to-benefit-school-1142384?p=0 |newspaper=[[Pittsburgh Post-Gazette]] |date=April 28, 2011 |accessdate=July 29, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The event was first produced in 1994,&lt;ref name="DiVittorio"&gt;{{cite news |title=Glassport’s Lord Zoltan, friends aid school with Deaf WrestleFest |author=DiVittorio, Michael |url=http://www.pittsburghlive.com/x/dailynewsmckeesport/sports/s_734634.html |newspaper=McKeesport Daily News |date=April 29, 2011 |accessdate=July 29, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Clark"&gt;{{cite news |title=Wrestling legends come together to raise funds for charitable cause |author=Clark, Jerry |url=http://www.yournorthhills.com/northhillsnews/article/wrestling-legends-come-together-raise-funds-charitable-cause |newspaper=Your North Hills |date=April 29, 2010 |accessdate=July 29, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; originally as part of the [[Steel City Wrestling]] promotion, and produced six editions until the promotion closed in 2000, and two more independently. The school, according to Zoltan, then decided to discontinue the event due to the [[The Attitude Era|increasing violence and adult content]] associated with professional wrestling during the late-1990s. Two of his sons, both Deaf, attended the school during this period. Following a seven-year hiatus, it was revived for the school's 140th anniversary in 2009;&lt;ref name="DiVittorio"/&gt; the highlight of the show was [[James J. Dillon|J.J. Dillon]] who, in his first in-ring appearance since 1989, teamed with [[Lou Marconi|"Beef Stew" Lou Marconi]] and [[Frank Stalletto|"Handsome" Frank Staletto]] in a six-man tag team match against [[Shane Douglas|"Franchise" Shane Douglas]], [[Dominic Denucci]] and [[Cody Michaels]].&lt;ref name="Deitch"&gt;{{cite news |title=The Wrestler |author=Deitch, Charlie |url=http://www.pittsburghcitypaper.ws/gyrobase/Content?oid=oid%3A62565 |newspaper=Pittsburgh City Paper |date=April 30, 2009 |accessdate=August 26, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Schrum"&gt;{{cite news |title=Zoltan organizes Deaf WrestleFest |author=Shrum, Rick |url=http://www.post-gazette.com/pg/09120/966536-55.stm |newspaper=[[Pittsburgh Post-Gazette]] |date=April 30, 2009 |accessdate=July 29, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.411mania.com/wrestling/news/103744 |title=Various News: RVD Video Blog, Doug Basham Retires, JJ Dillon Returns to the Ring, More |author=Csonka, Larry |date=May 5, 2009 |work=News |publisher=411mania.com |accessdate=July 29, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The event is a staple on the [[East Coast of the United States|East Coast]] and [[Mid-Atlantic states|Mid-Atlantic]] [[independent circuit]]. Unlike standard wrestling events, however, an interpreter is provided to [[sign language|sign]] for the students during promos and for other parts of the show.&lt;ref name="PPG2000"/&gt; Among the promotions represented at the event are the International Wrestling Cartel, [[Keystone State Wrestling Alliance]],&lt;ref name="Martin2010"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Babinsack2010"/&gt; [[National Wrestling Alliance]] and UCW Wrestling; the arrival of the [[North Carolina]]-based [[Southern Championship Wrestling#G.O.U.G.E.

[[Image:Converterbox.JPG|thumb|right|A digital TV converter box]]
A '''digital television adapter''' ('''DTA'''), commonly known as a '''converter box''', is a [[tuner (television)|television tuner]] that receives a [[digital television]] (DTV) transmission, and converts the [[Digital signal (broadcasting)|digital signal]] into an [[analog signal]] that can be received and displayed on an [[analog television]] set.  The input digital signal may be over-the-air [[terrestrial television]] signals received by a [[television antenna]], or signals from a [[digital cable]] system.  It normally does not refer to [[satellite TV]], which has always required a [[set-top box]] either to operate the [[TVRO|big]] [[satellite dish]], or to be the [[integrated receiver/decoder]] (IRD) in the case of [[direct-broadcast satellite]]s (DBS).

In [[North America]], these  [[ATSC tuner]] boxes convert from [[ATSC]] to [[NTSC]], while in most of [[Europe]] and other places such as [[Australia]], they convert from [[Digital Video Broadcasting]] (DVB) to [[PAL]].  Because the [[DTV transition]] did nothing to reduce the number of [[broadcast television system]] standards (and in fact further complicated them), and due to varying [[frequency allocation]]s and [[bandplan]]s, there are many other combinations specific to other countries.

==United States==
On June 12, 2009, all full-power [[analog television]] transmissions ended in the United States.  Viewers who watch [[broadcast television]] on older analog TV sets must use a DTA.  Since many of the [[low-power TV]] stations will continue to broadcast in analog for years to come, consumers who watch low-power stations will need an adapter with an [[analog passthrough]] feature that allows the viewer to watch both digital and analog signals.  Viewers who receive their television signals through cable or satellite were not affected by this change and did not need a digital television adapter (however, see the cable TV exception below).  Additionally, viewers who have newer televisions with built-in digital ATSC tuners will not need an external digital television adapter.

The United States government had set up a program to offer consumers a $40 "coupon" which could be used toward the purchase of a [[coupon-eligible converter box]]; that program ended in July 2006.

===History===
At the [[Consumer Electronics Association]]'s Entertainment Technology Policy Summit in January 2006, [[Federal Communications Commission]] (FCC) [[Commissioner]] [[Jonathan Adelstein]] said many Americans did not know about the February 17, 2006, deadline for ending analog TV. Furthermore, he said, too many people were still buying analog TV sets, meaning more demand for converter boxes. And even if people found out what they would have to do, converter boxes might not do the job adequately. [[Tribune Broadcasting]] chief technology officer Ira Goldstone said just buying a converter box did not necessarily mean getting the latest technology. Bob Seidel of [[CBS]] said companies (especially in countries other than the US) might use cheaper tuners, and people would need new television antennas for proper reception. [[Circuit City (1949–2009 company)|Circuit City]] Chairman Alan McCollough opposed converter boxes, saying people should just buy digital TVs, and [[television network]]s should offer only [[widescreen]]-format [[television program]]ming as an incentive to do that.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.broadcastingcable.com/article/99747-High_Hurdles_in_Digital_TV_Race.php |title=High Hurdles in Digital-TV Race |work=[[Broadcasting &amp; Cable]] |first=Glen |last=Dickson |date=2006-03-19 |accessdate=2009-08-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Prototype]]s of the first converter boxes appeared at the [[National Association of Broadcasters|NAB]] show in 2006. [[LG Electronics]], which took over [[Zenith Electronics]] in 1999, showed its model connected to a Zenith TV from 1980, while [[Thomson SA|Thomson Consumer Electronics]] used an [[RCA]] TV from 1987 for its demonstration. Both boxes shown used [[electronic program guide]]s using [[Program and System Information Protocol]] (PSIP). The devices showed program details, [[V-chip]] ratings and signal strength. Thomson's model stored three days of TV listings, allowed parental controls, and could set a [[VCR]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.broadcastingcable.com/article/103959-Old_TVs_Steal_Show_at_NAB.php |title=Old TVs Steal Show at NAB |work=[[Broadcasting &amp; Cable]] |first=Glen |last=Dickson |date=2006-04-30 |accessdate=2009-08-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Differences for cable customers===
Cable TV systems are under no deadline to convert to digital TV. However, many [[Comcast]] (and some other cable TV) customers are finding all of their non-local and non-[[Shopping channel|shopping networks]] eliminated on various dates, even though only a few are needed for additional [[digital cable]] channels. CECBs (Coupon-eligible converter boxes) will not work on these systems because cable ATSC uses [[Quadrature amplitude modulation|256QAM]] [[modulation]] instead of [[8VSB]], and so a separate but similar DTA with a [[QAM (television)|QAM tuner]] is necessary. If the cable company takes away analog channels, at least two of these adapters must be provided for free by the cable company for at least three years so that customers can continue to watch the same channels with existing equipment.{{Citation needed|date=August 2009}} Cable companies were required to provide some analog service until October 2006.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.kansascity.com/news/business/technology/article11054294.html|title=Time Warner Cable changes mean every TV needs a box now|last=Davis|first=Mark|work=[[Kansas City Star]]|date=2015-02-24|accessdate=2015-08-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; After that, taking away analog channels allowed faster Internet and more [[High-definition television|HD channels]]. An adapter from the cable provider was needed even for digital TVs if the company [[Television encryption|scrambled]] its digital signals to prevent [[Copyright infringement#.22Piracy.22|piracy]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.latimes.com/business/la-fi-laz-time-warner-cable-box-20141024-story.html|title=Can you go to Best Buy for Time Warner Cable's new box?|last=Lazarus|first=David|work=[[Los Angeles Times]]|date=2014-10-24|accessdate=2015-08-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A digital transport adapter will allow viewing of basic channels, often as many as 99, but not [[Pay television|premium channels]]. It will also not allow [[video on demand]] or [[pay-per-view]]. Simple DTAs only allow analog sets to receive digital signals using [[Radio frequency|RF]] output on channel 3 or 4, using [[coaxial cable]]. Other versions of the DTA are available.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dslreports.com/faq/16218|title=What is a DTA? What channels can I get with a DTA? What about those new HD-DTA?|publisher=dslreports.com|accessdate=2015-08-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Pace plc]] developed the XiD-P digital transport adapter for [[Comcast]], allowing [[Ultra-high-definition television|4K]] service and offering the potential to expand the DTA from one-way to two-way. This would involve adding [[Internet Protocol|IP]] capability.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=New Device Could Speed Comcast's IP-Video Migration|last=Baumgartner|first=Jeff|work=[[Broadcasting &amp; Cable]]|date=2015-06-01|page=9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==European Union==
Most countries that have switched to digital TV use [[DVB-T]] broadcasting with [[MPEG-2]] [[MPEG-2#Video profiles and levels|MP@ML]] or H.264 encoding. Some, however, consider switching to  [[DVB-T2]] such as the [[United Kingdom|UK]], being the first to test DVB-T2. This results in a number of different combinations for external digital receivers with the MPEG-2 ones sold at about €15 to €35 and the MPEG-4 ones reaching €25 to €150. Currently, all set top boxes sold in EU cannot exceed 0.5W in stand by mode.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6726">The '''Evil Overlord List''', also known as '''If I Were An Evil Overlord''', is one of several popular lists of planned actions for a competent [[Dark Lord|Evil Overlord]] to avoid the well-known, [[cliché]] blunders committed by [[supervillains]] in popular fictional works, typically explained in a [[comedy|comical]] fashion. The lists were compiled by [[science fiction]] fans over a number of years, and copies of the list that can be found on the Internet vary in number and order of entries.

==History==
The most famous specific lists, both referred to as the '''Evil Overlord List''', were developed concurrently. Both were published to the web in the early 1990s. The original, if lesser-known list was compiled in 1990 by members of the now-defunct [[FidoNet]] Science Fiction and Fandom (SFFAN) email echo. The FidoNet list originated with a 1988 ''[[Saturday Night Live]]'' skit featuring [[James Bond|Bond]] Villains touting a book "What Not To Do When You Capture James Bond". The FidoNet list arose out of discussions regarding what sort of advice might be in that book, and was compiled and published by Jack Butler. It predated the following list, but was only widely published later, and is the more obscure of the two.

The later-produced and more famous version of the list was compiled in 1994 by Peter Anspach (hence it is occasionally titled "Peter's Evil Overlord List") based on informal discussions at conventions and on online bulletin boards in the early 1990s,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.eviloverlord.com/lists/overlord.html |title=Peter's Evil Overlord List |last=Anspach |first=Peter |accessdate=September 26, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; and has subsequently become one of the best-known parodies of bad [[Speculative fiction|SF/F]] writing, frequently referenced online. It was originally '''The Top 100 Things I'd Do If I Ever Became An Evil Overlord''', but grew to include over 100 entries.

Anspach and Butler acknowledge the existence of each other's lists, and state that their two lists have been so cross-pollinated over the years as to become effectively identical.

The Evil Overlord List has led to spinoffs, including lists for [[stock character]]s including (but not limited to) [[hero]]es, [[Henchman|henchmen]], [[sidekick]]s, the Evil Overlord's [[Accountant]], and [[Starfleet]] captains.&lt;ref&gt; {{cite web |url=http://www.sff.net/paradise/overlord.html |title=Stupid Plot Tricks - The Evil Overlord Devises a Plot |accessdate=2006-12-14 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070930165417/http://www.sff.net/paradise/overlord.html |archivedate=2007-09-30 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Usage==
In [[Australia]], a minor literary scandal erupted in 1997 when it emerged that award-winning author [[Helen Darville]] [[plagiarism|plagiarised]] this list for her regular column in [[Brisbane]]'s ''[[The Courier-Mail|Courier-Mail]]'' newspaper, which led to her being fired.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|first=David|last=Greason|title=The Review – TZADIK|publisher=Australia/Israel &amp; Jewish Affairs Council|journal=|url=http://www.aijac.org.au/review/1997/222/tzad222.html|accessdate=26 September 2006|date=15 February 1997|volume=|number=|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061012013532/http://www.aijac.org.au/review/1997/222/tzad222.html|archivedate=12 October 2006|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|work=[[The Australian]]|title=Editor dumps Darville|page=3|date=5 February 1997|url=|accessdate=|author=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Teresa Nielsen Hayden]], noted author and lecturer, uses an expanded version of the list in her lectures on writing science fiction. She recommends selecting five [[random plot generator|random]] clichés from the list, and using them, or their reverse ("Say you've drawn A-34, 'I will not turn into a snake. It never helps.' You can have a character turn into a snake and find it doesn't help, or do it and find it very useful indeed") as the basis for a plot.&lt;ref name=Hayden&gt;[http://www.sff.net/paradise/plottricks.htm "The Evil Overlord Devises a Plot"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070930165557/http://www.sff.net/paradise/plottricks.htm |date=2007-09-30 }} Excerpted from Teresa Nielsen Hayden lecture on Stupid Plotting Tricks&lt;/ref&gt;

From 2001–2002, the alt.eo [[Alt.* hierarchy]] [[newsgroup]] was dedicated to discussing and adding to the list.&lt;ref name=alteo&gt;[http://www.faqs.org/faqs/humor/evil-overlords/ "Official Alt.eo FAQ v0.1.2"], 8 December 2002&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2007, issue #6 of [[Marvel Comics]]' ''[[Heroes for Hire]]'' featured a [[Doctor Doom|Doombot]] which had been reprogrammed with the contents of the list.

''If I Were An Evil Overlord'', a 2007 short story anthology edited by [[Martin H. Greenberg]] and Russell Davis, explicitly references the various lists as source material.

[[PS238]], issue 33 (published in 2008), includes a mention of the EOL in the main story, plus an appendix with fifty major points from the list. &lt;ref&gt; Aaron Williams, ''PS238'', issue 33, July 2008. &lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[S.M. Stirling]] novel ''The Protector's War'', excerpts from the list are printed in the back of the book of plans distributed to the Protector's subordinate nobles.

[[Jim Butcher]] refers to the list a number of times in his contemporary fantasy series, [[The Dresden Files]].

In May 2012, students from [[Lehigh University]] of Pennsylvania published a blog post that examined how much it would cost to follow all of the instructions on the list. The students concluded that while some money would be saved, overall it would require $14,268,632.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.centives.net/S/2012/the-cost-of-being-an-unbeatable-evil-overlord-2/| title=The Cost Of Being An Unbeatable Evil Overlord| publisher=Centives| date=May 27, 2012| accessdate=2012-05-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{distinguish|Free-to-air}}
'''Free-to-view''' ('''FTV''') is a term used for audio and/or video transmissions that are provided free-of-charge without any form of continual subscription but are nevertheless [[encryption|encrypted]].&lt;ref&gt;"A-Z Of Satellite TV: F" ''What Satellite &amp; Digital TV'' October 2012 pp37&lt;/ref&gt; It differs from [[free-to-air]] (FTA) where content is not encrypted.

==Free-to-view vs. Free-to-air==
The free-to-view system contrasts with [[free-to-air]] (FTA), in which signals are transmitted in the clear, without [[encryption]], and can be received by anyone with a suitable receiving [[satellite dish|dish]] antenna and [[Digital Video Broadcasting|DVB]]-compliant receiver (although these services can include proprietary encrypted data services such as an [[electronic program guide|EPG]] that is only available to reception equipment made for, or authorised by, the FTA broadcaster). Free-to-view services are broadcast encrypted and can only be viewed with reception equipment that includes a suitable [[conditional-access module]] and viewing card, in the same way as a [[pay-TV]] satellite service. However, the FTV service viewing card is not subject to a continuing subscription payment for viewing the service's channels and may be available for a regular fee, a one-off payment or even for free.{{citation needed|date=December 2014}}

Services which charge a regular fee for reception can still be considered free-to-view, and not [[pay-TV]] if the fee is not for the programming content but for the delivery. {{Disputed inline|date=January 2015}}  For example, the HD+ service in Germany, which broadcasts  [[High-definition television|HD]] versions of channels which are also available free-to-air in standard definition, defended its service fee saying it "is related to the reception of the offer and not to specific content, parts or packages of the offer".&lt;ref&gt;Briel, Robert [http://www.broadbandtvnews.com/2009/09/10/kayser-give-details-about-hd-platform/''Kayser rebuffs critics of HD+ platform''] ''Broadband TV News''  10 September 2009. Accessed 30 November 2014&lt;/ref&gt;

==Commercial restrictions and targeting==
The free-to-view system allows for restricting access based on location of the viewer. For example, in the UK prior to the launch of [[Astra 2D]], UK channels broadcasting from the [[Astra 28.2°E]] satellites used a wide beam and could be received across Europe on small dishes. Those channels which were non-subscription but aimed at the UK only, or restricted from broadcasting outside the UK by way of programme rights (such as [[Channel 5 (UK)|Channel 5]]) or governance (such as the [[BBC]] channels), were broadcast encrypted using [[Videoguard]] (as used by [[Sky (United Kingdom)|Sky (UK)]] for its pay-TV services) with viewing cards made available to UK residents only.&lt;ref&gt;Bains, Geoff. "Flight of the Big Birds" ''What Satellite &amp; Digital TV'' February 2012 pp29&lt;/ref&gt;

The launch of Astra 2D with a broadcast beam narrowly aimed at the UK and Ireland only enabled UK channels to switch from broadcasting free-to-view to free-to-air, while maintaining their UK exclusivity. The decline of UK free-to-view in favour of narrow-beamed free-to-air has been gradual:

*The BBC's eight digital channels were encrypted under the scheme from their launch on digital satellite until 14 July 2003, when they became free-to-air.
*Shortly after this, ITV stated its intentions to go free-to-air eventually, and launched their newest channel, [[ITV3]], in the clear on 1 November 2004.
*This was followed up by ITV moving its [[Men &amp; Motors]] channel to FTA in July 2005.
*This gradual conversion was completed on  1 November 2005, with [[ITV1]] and [[ITV2]] going FTA. ITV's latest channel, [[ITV4]], was launched at the same time, also as a free-to-air service. All the BBC and ITV channels at this time could be viewed FTA without any subscription or purchase from Sky.
*However, in June 2008, some ITV regional channels were encrypted again due to one of their narrow beam transponder agreements ending.
*In April, 2011, high definition [[Channel 4 HD]] moved from being a free-to-view channel to a free-to-air channel (when moving to a transponder on Eurobird).
*1 December 2011, [[5USA]], 5USA+1, [[5*]] and 5*+1 became free-to-air after moving to [[Astra 1N]].
*6 June 2012, [[Pick TV]] and Pick TV +1 became free-to-air.
*During October 2012, the final free-to-view regions of [[ITV1]], ITV1 +1 and [[ITV1 HD]] became free-to-air.
*25 March 2013, [[Viva (UK &amp; Ireland)|Viva]] went free-to-air.
*28 October 2013, Channel 5 HD switched from free-to-view became a subscription channel on the Sky digital satellite platform and is no longer a channel.
*[[LFC TV]] switched from free-to-view to Sky subscription only.
*7 February 2017, [[4Music]] became free-to-air.

The remaining channel aimed exclusively at the UK that use the [[Astra (satellite)|Astra]] satellites at 28.2°E with a Europe-wide beam and remain free-to-view and encrypted is [[Sony Entertainment Television (UK &amp; Ireland)|Sony Entertainment Television]] and they can be viewed with a Sky Videoguard receiver and a Sky viewing card, either an inactive former Sky pay-TV card or one for the [[Freesat from Sky]] package, bought for a one-off fee.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sky.com/shop/freesat/home/what-can-i-watch/ List of Freesat from Sky channels] Accessed 30 November 2014&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Guyana Zoo''' (officially '''Guyana Zoological Park''') is a [[zoo]] located in [[Georgetown, Guyana|Georgetown]], the capital of [[Guyana]]. The zoo officially opened in 1952, but its grounds had been used as botanical gardens since 1895. Some of its most popular attractions are [[harpy eagle]]s and [[manatee]]s.&lt;ref name="MtA"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sdnp.org.gy/guyanazoo/meet_the_animals.htm|title=Meet the Animals|publisher=Guyana Zoological Park|accessdate=7 January 2010|location=[[Georgetown, Guyana|Georgetown]], [[Guyana]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As of 2005, the zoo had approximately 25 staff.&lt;ref name="AtZ"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sdnp.org.gy/guyanazoo/about_the_zoo.htm|title=About the Zoo|publisher=Guyana Zoological Park|accessdate=7 January 2010|location=[[Georgetown, Guyana|Georgetown]], [[Guyana]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Hamster racing''' is a sport in which [[hamster]]s are placed in [[hamster wheel]]s or [[hamster ball]]s – often fitted to miniature racing vehicles – and raced down a straight 9 meter (30&amp;nbsp;ft) course.  The hamster crossing the finish line in the shortest amount of time wins. According to a 2001 media report, the world-record time for this course setup is 38 seconds.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Hamster races soothe restless bettors as foot-and-mouth slows action |work=Boston Globe |url=http://www.boston.com/news/daily/08/hamster_races.htm |first=Beth |last=Gardiner |publisher=Boston Globe Electronic Publishing |year=2001 |accessdate=2006-05-14 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060303213800/http://www.boston.com/news/daily/08/hamster_races.htm |archivedate=March 3, 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Events may feature as few as two hamsters or many teams of hamsters and human [[pit stop|pit crews]].  Hamster balls may be simple spheres or feature many design modifications purported to increase the performance and style of the race vehicle.

In the United Kingdom, [[gamblers]] can place [[Sports betting|bets]] on the outcome of hamster races through online [[bookmakers]].

==Professional racing==
In 2001, an epidemic of [[foot and mouth]] disease caused the cancellation of some British [[horse racing|horse races]] and other sporting events. To boost their lagging [[bookmaking]] incomes, betting agencies introduced and promoted the concept of professional hamster racing. Online bookmaker [[The Rank Group|Blue Square]] organized the first hamster racing series, with the rodents racing in hamster dragsters. A series of qualifying rounds were held over a week, with a final race. The event was webcast live on the internet and generated significant media interest, including full-page articles in the [[Daily Mail]] and [[The Sun (United Kingdom)|Sun]] newspapers, as well as live reports on [[BBC London]] and [[Sky News]]. This high level of media interest was in part due to the cancellation of horse racing at the time.

While largely confined to the [[United Kingdom]], professional hamster racing has since made inroads in the [[United States]] and [[Asia]].

Race hamsters are almost always divided into at least two race classes, which follow their [[species]] classifications: [[Cricetulus|dwarfs]] and [[syrian hamster|Syrians]].  They are also often divided into other race classes, such as [[novice]], patterned and long-hair or short-hair.

Not all hamster racing is done professionally or for betting purposes. [[Amateur]] hamster races are popular at [[Church body|church]] outings and frequently occur at hamster and [[rodent]] shows.  Amateur races generally do not conform to the professional 9 meter (30&amp;nbsp;ft) track distance but may use shorter "[[Sprint (running)|sprint]]" tracks designed to make sure all hamsters finish in a reasonable time. Fast hamsters are capable of winning sprint races in just a few [[second]]s.

==Recent sponsorship==
'''Petco'''
[[Image:Winning hamster Petco Hamster Derby.jpg|right|thumb|200px|"Ham*Star," the winner of Petco's March 2007 San Diego Regional Hamster Ball Derby, with her prizes]]
In early 2007, [[Petco]] announced the return of biannual hamster races in all of its stores.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=Petco Press Release, 14 March 2007 | work=Petco | url=http://www.petco.com/Content/PressRelease.aspx?PC=pr031407 | accessdate=2007-08-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The event is branded the "Petco Hamster Ball Derby" and takes place in late March and early September of each year. The 2006 races featured more than 14,000 amateur race hamsters and their owners in Petco stores across the country.

Petco uses a nonstandard short {{convert|8|ft|m|sing=on}} track and hamsters run in common spherical balls rather than the elaborate "drag racers" that professional race hamsters often use (see [[MTV]] Sponsorship ''infra'').  Races usually only last a few seconds due to the length of the track. Winners receive various prizes such as gift cards, training equipment and hamster treats.

'''MTV'''

&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[Image:Mtv hamtrak06.jpg|right|thumb|200px|MTV's HamTrak '06]]  --&gt;
In May 2006 [[MTV]] began promotion of "HamTrak '06," a world tour of [[professional]] [[hamster]] racers featuring hamster teams sponsored by ''[[The Sun (United Kingdom)|The Sun]]'', ''[[XFM]]'', ''[[Pimp My Ride]]'' and others.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=HamTrak '06 Official Site |work=MTV.uk Overdrive |url=http://hamtrak06.mtv.co.uk/ |accessdate=2006-05-14 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060615084759/http://hamtrak06.mtv.co.uk/ |archivedate=June 15, 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first HamTrak race, held on May 19, 2006 at the Hammywood Hills Rodent Raceway, was won by the [[New Media Age]] sponsored "Team Hot Rodent," powered by the eight-month-old female Syrian hamster Michelle Schuhamster.  It was her 24th career win.

==Handicapping==
One issue that has limited the growth of professional hamster racing is the difficulty in [[handicapping]], or attempting to predict the winner, of a hamster racing contest. As with [[horse racing]], the handicapping of hamsters relies on observations of the speed, pace, form, and class of the animal. However, while many bettors believe themselves to be good [[horse]] handicappers, few know what to look for in hamster handicapping as they are unfamiliar with the [[species]]. This means that the large population of horse racing bettors are often unwilling to migrate to hamster racing because to do so would require either placing uninformed, pure-[[luck|chance]] [[bets]] or learning to judge and handicap an entirely new animal.

His contribution to the world of music was summed up by [[Virgil Thomson]], writing in the early 1950s:&lt;ref&gt;The most recent standard collection of Virgil Thomson's writings, edited by [[Richard Kostelanetz]] and published in 2002, identifies Thomson's statement as undated. The statement is excerpted at length in the liner notes to the Smithsonian Folkways CD ''Henry Cowell: Piano Music'' issued in 1993. There the quote is dated 1953, but no source is provided. Given that (a) many of the dates listed for Cowell's piano pieces in the Folkways liner notes are incorrect (see Hicks [2002], p. 80, for more on that topic) and (b) Thomson refers to "experiments begun three decades ago," a date earlier than 1953 is plausible.&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
Henry Cowell's music covers a wider range in both expression and technique than that of any other living composer. His experiments begun three decades ago in rhythm, in harmony, and in instrumental sonorities were considered then by many to be wild. Today they are the Bible of the young and still, to the conservatives, "advanced."... No other composer of our time has produced a body of works so radical and so normal, so penetrating and so comprehensive. Add to this massive production his long and influential career as a pedagogue, and Henry Cowell's achievement becomes impressive indeed. There is no other quite like it. To be both fecund and right is given to few.&lt;ref&gt;Thomson (2002), p. 167.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Early life==
Born in rural [[Menlo Park, California]], to two [[Bohemianism|bohemian]] writers—his father was an Irish immigrant and his mother, a former schoolteacher, had relocated from Iowa—Cowell demonstrated precocious musical talent and began playing the violin at the age of five. After his parents' divorce in 1903, he was raised by his mother, [[Clarissa Dixon]], author of the early feminist novel ''Janet and Her Dear Phebe''. His father, with whom he maintained contact, introduced him to the [[music of Ireland|Irish music]] that would be a touchstone for Cowell throughout his career. While receiving no formal musical education (and little schooling of any kind beyond his mother's home tutelage), he began to compose in his mid-teens.

By the summer of 1914, Cowell was writing truly individualistic works, including the insistently repetitive ''Anger Dance'' (originally ''Mad Dance'').&lt;ref&gt;Cowell describes the inspiration for the piece in the commentary track he recorded for Folkways in 1963: "The ''Anger Dance'' was composed at a time when I had been very much annoyed by the fact that a doctor to whom I showed a bent-up leg suggested that it should be cut off immediately. And since I didn't in the least approve of this, and thinking of it over and over again made me more and more angry, I stomped home on my crutches, and the phrases of the ''Anger Dance'' went through my mind louder and louder as I walked home" (track 20/5:06–5:41). Cowell biographer Michael Hicks (2002) describes the work as one of Cowell's "most prescient" and "proto-minimalist" (p. 60). The piece does, in terms of structure, anticipate [[Minimalist music|minimalist]] procedures, and an interpretation by Steffen Schleiermacher from 1993 is simultaneously metronomic and jazzy in a way that reveals its kinship with the work of [[Steve Reich]], in particular. But in his own 1963 recording, Cowell expresses a torment, through jagged [[Tempo|tempi]] and ambivalent [[dynamics (music)|dynamics]] (all clearly purposeful), that renders ''Anger Dance'' very different in character from the work of the American minimalists.&lt;/ref&gt; That fall, the largely self-taught Cowell was admitted to the [[University of California, Berkeley]], as a protégé of [[Charles Seeger]]. There he studied harmony and other subjects under Seeger and Edward Griffith Stricklen and counterpoint under [[Wallace Arthur Sabin]].&lt;ref&gt;Hicks (2002), p. 68.&lt;/ref&gt; After two years at Berkeley, Cowell pursued further studies in New York where he encountered [[Leo Ornstein]], the radically "futurist" composer-pianist. Still a teenager, Cowell wrote the piano piece ''Dynamic Motion'' (1916), his first important work to explore the possibilities of the [[tone cluster]] ({{Audio|Cowell-Dynamic Motion.ogg|listen}}). It requires the performer to use both forearms to play massive [[secundal]] [[Chord (music)|chords]] and calls for keys to be held down without sounding to extend and intensify its [[Consonance and dissonance|dissonant]] cluster [[overtone]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Bartok et al. (1993), p. 14 (unpaginated).&lt;/ref&gt;

Cowell soon returned to California, where he had become involved with a [[Theosophy (Blavatskian)|theosophical]] community, [[Halcyon, California|Halcyon]], led by the Irish poet [[John Varian]], who fueled Cowell's interest in [[Culture of Ireland|Irish folk culture]] and [[Irish mythology|mythology]]. In 1917, Cowell wrote the music for Varian's stage production ''The Building of Banba''; the prelude he composed, ''[[The Tides of Manaunaun]]'', with its rich, evocative clusters, would become Cowell's most famous and widely performed work.&lt;ref&gt;Hicks (2002), p. 85.&lt;/ref&gt; In later years, Cowell would claim that the piece had been composed around 1912 (and ''Dynamic Motion'' in 1914), in an evident attempt to make his musical innovations appear even more precocious than they already were.&lt;ref&gt;Hicks (2002), p. 58.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Prime of career==

===Musical pioneer===
Beginning in the early 1920s, Cowell toured widely in North America and Europe as a pianist, playing his own experimental works, seminal explorations of [[atonality]], [[polytonality]], [[polyrhythm]]s, and non-Western [[musical mode|modes]]. It was on one of these tours that in 1923, his friend [[Richard Buhlig]] introduced Cowell to young pianist [[Grete Sultan]] in Berlin. They worked closely together&amp;mdash;an aspect vital to Grete Sultan's personal and artistic development. Cowell later made such an impression with his tone cluster technique that [[Béla Bartók]] requested his permission to adopt it. Another novel method advanced by Cowell, in pieces such as ''Aeolian Harp'' (ca. 1923), was what he dubbed "[[string piano]]"—rather than using the keys to play, the pianist reaches inside the instrument and plucks, sweeps, and otherwise manipulates the strings directly. Cowell's endeavors with string piano techniques were the primary inspiration for [[John Cage]]'s development of the [[prepared piano]].&lt;ref&gt;Nicholls (1998), p. 523.&lt;/ref&gt; In early chamber music pieces, such as ''Quartet Romantic'' (1915–17) and ''Quartet Euphometric'' (1916–19 {{Audio|Cowell-Quartet Euphometric.ogg|listen}}), Cowell pioneered a compositional approach he called "rhythm-harmony": "Both quartets are [[polyphony|polyphonic]], and each melodic strand has its own rhythm," he explained. "Even the [[Canon (music)|canon]] in the first movement of the ''Romantic'' has different note-lengths for each voice."&lt;ref&gt;Quoted in Oja (1998), p. 4 (unpaginated).&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1919, Cowell had begun writing ''New Musical Resources'', which would finally be published after extensive revision in 1930. Focusing on the variety of innovative [[rhythm]]ic and harmonic concepts he used in his compositions (and others that were still entirely speculative), it would have a powerful effect on the American [[experimental music|musical avant-garde]] for decades after. [[Conlon Nancarrow]], for instance, would refer to it years later as having "the most influence of anything I've ever read in music."&lt;ref&gt;Quoted in Gann (1995), p. 43.&lt;/ref&gt;

Cowell's interest in [[harmonic rhythm]], as discussed in ''New Musical Resources'', led him in 1930 to commission [[Léon Theremin]] to invent the [[Rhythmicon]], or Polyrhythmophone, a [[transposition (music)|transposable]] keyboard instrument capable of playing notes in periodic rhythms proportional to the [[harmonic series (music)|overtone series]] of a chosen [[fundamental frequency|fundamental]] [[pitch (music)|pitch]]. The world's first electronic [[drum machine|rhythm machine]], with a photoreceptor-based sound production system proposed by Cowell (not a [[theremin]]-like system, as some sources incorrectly state), it could produce up to sixteen different [[rhythmic unit|rhythmic patterns]] simultaneously, complete with optional [[syncopation]]. Cowell wrote several original compositions for the instrument, including an orchestrated concerto, and Theremin built two more models. Soon, however, the Rhythmicon would be virtually forgotten, remaining so until the 1960s, when [[progressive pop]] music producer [[Joe Meek]] experimented with its rhythmic concept.

Cowell pursued a radical compositional approach through the mid-1930s, with solo piano pieces remaining at the heart of his output—important works from this era include ''The Banshee'' (1925), requiring numerous playing methods such as [[pizzicato]] and longitudinal sweeping and scraping of the strings ({{Audio|Cowell-The Banshee.ogg|listen}}),&lt;ref&gt;Bartok et al. (1993), p. 12 (unpaginated).&lt;/ref&gt; and the manic, cluster-filled ''Tiger'' (1930), inspired by [[William Blake]]'s famous [[The Tyger|poem]].&lt;ref&gt;For the composer's description of the inspiration, listen to Cowell (1993), 11:58–12:05.&lt;/ref&gt; Much of Cowell's public reputation continued to be based on his trademark pianistic technique: a critic for the ''San Francisco News'', writing in 1932, referred to Cowell's "famous 'tone clusters,' probably the most startling and original contribution any American has yet contributed to the field of music."&lt;ref&gt;Quoted in Mead (1981), p. 190.&lt;/ref&gt; A prolific composer of songs (he would write over 180 during his career), Cowell returned in 1930–31 to ''Aeolian Harp'', adapting it as the accompaniment to a vocal setting of a poem by his father, ''How Old Is Song?'' He built on his substantial oeuvre of chamber music, with pieces such as the Adagio for Cello and Thunder Stick (1924) that explored unusual instrumentation and others that were even more progressive: ''Six Casual Developments'' (1933), for clarinet and piano, sounds like something [[Jimmy Giuffre]] would compose thirty years later. His ''Ostinato Pianissimo'' (1934) placed him in the vanguard of those writing original scores for percussion ensemble. He created forceful large-ensemble pieces during this period as well, such as the Concerto for Piano and Orchestra (1928)—with its three movements, "Polyharmony," "Tone Cluster," and "Counter Rhythm" ({{Audio|Cowell-Piano Concerto M3.ogg|listen}})—and the Sinfonietta (1928), whose [[scherzo]] [[Anton Webern]] conducted in Vienna.&lt;ref&gt;Kirkpatrick (1997), p. 105.&lt;/ref&gt; In the early 1930s, Cowell began to delve seriously into [[Aleatoric music|aleatoric]] procedures, creating opportunities for performers to determine primary elements of a score's realization.&lt;ref&gt;It is possible that Cowell had earlier dabbled in a more whimsical form of aleatory. The liner notes to the Folkways ''Henry Cowell: Piano Music'', written in 1963 and revised in 1993, assert that each phrase of ''Anger Dance'' "may be repeated many times, depending on how angry the player is able to feel." Of ''Advertisement'' (Third Encore to ''Dynamic Motion'') (1917, not 1914 as the liner notes state)—which Cowell called "a satire on repititious advertisement of a raucous nature" (track 20/2:14–2:20)—it is likewise said that "there is a section that may be repeated, to emphasize the absurdity, as many times as the performer likes." Nicholls (1991) notes that, in fact, the published score of ''Anger Dance'' "gives specific instructions regarding the number of repetitions each musical fragment should be subjected to" (p. 167). He observes, however, that Cowell in his own recording of the piece reiterates certain phrases beyond the specified number.&lt;/ref&gt; One of his major chamber pieces, the ''Mosaic Quartet'' (String Quartet No. 3) (1935), is scored as a collection of five movements with no preordained sequence.

===Ultra-modernist and world music leader===
Cowell was the central figure in a circle of avant-garde composers that included his good friends [[Carl Ruggles]] and [[Dane Rudhyar]], as well as Leo Ornstein, John Becker, [[Colin McPhee]], French expatriate [[Edgard Varèse]], and [[Ruth Crawford Seeger|Ruth Crawford]], whom he convinced Charles Seeger to take on as a student (Crawford and Seeger would eventually marry). Cowell and his circle were sometimes referred to as "ultra-modernists," a label whose definition is flexible and origin unclear (it has also been applied to a few composers outside the immediate circle, such as [[George Antheil]], and to some of its disciples, such as Nancarrow); Virgil Thomson styled them the "rhythmic research fellows."&lt;ref&gt;Thomson (2002 [1961]), p. 164.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1925, Cowell organized the New Music Society, one of whose primary activities was the staging of concerts of their works along with those of artistic allies such as [[Wallingford Riegger]] and [[Arnold Schoenberg]], who would later ask Cowell to play for his composition class during one of his European tours. In 1927 Cowell founded the periodical ''New Music Quarterly'', which would publish many significant new scores under his editorship, both by the ultra-modernists and many others, including Ernst Bacon, [[Otto Luening]], [[Paul Bowles]], and [[Aaron Copland]]. Before the publication of the first issue, he solicited contributions from a then-obscure composer who would become one of his closest friends, [[Charles Ives]]. Major scores by Ives, including the ''Comedy'' from the Fourth Symphony, ''Fourth of July'', ''34 Songs'', and ''19 Songs'', would receive their first publication in ''New Music''; in turn, Ives would provide financial support to a number of Cowell's projects (including, years later, ''New Music'' itself). Many of the scores published in Cowell's journal were made even more widely available as performances of them were issued by the record label he established in 1934, New Music Recordings.

The ultra-modernist movement had expanded its reach in 1928, when Cowell led a group that included Ruggles, Varèse, his fellow expatriate Carlos Salzedo, American composer Emerson Whithorne, and Mexican composer [[Carlos Chávez]] in founding the Pan-American Association of Composers, dedicated to promoting composers from around the Western Hemisphere and creating a community among them that would transcend national lines. Its inaugural concert, held in New York City in March 1929, featured exclusively Latin American music, including works by Chávez, Brazilian composer [[Heitor Villa-Lobos]], Cuban composer [[Alejandro García Caturla]], and the French-born Cuban [[Amadeo Roldán]]. Its next concert, in April 1930, focused on the U.S. ultra-modernists, with works by Cowell, Crawford, Ives, Rudhyar, and others such as Antheil, [[Henry Brant]], and [[Vivian Fine]].&lt;ref&gt;Oja (2000), p. 194.&lt;/ref&gt; Over the next four years, [[Nicolas Slonimsky]] conducted concerts sponsored by the association in New York, across Europe, and, in 1933, Cuba.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.americancomposers.org/berlin_oja_article.htm "Nicolas Slonimsky: Maverick Conductor"] essay by Carol J. Oja; part of the American Composers Orchestra website. Retrieved 4/14/07.&lt;/ref&gt; Cowell himself had performed there in 1930 and met with Caturla, whom he was publishing in ''New Music''.&lt;ref&gt;Sublette (2004), p. 405.&lt;/ref&gt; Cowell would continue to work on both his behalf and Roldán's, whose ''Rítmica No. 5'' (1930) was the first free-standing piece of Western classical music written specifically for percussion ensemble.&lt;ref&gt;Solberger (1992), p. 2 (unpaginated). For instrumentation details, see [http://lolo816.tripod.com/1910-1940.htm Percussion Ensemble Music 1910–1940]. The first entr'acte in [[Dmitri Shostakovich]]'s opera ''[[The Nose (opera)|The Nose]]'' (1928) is scored for percussion ensemble.&lt;/ref&gt; During this era, Cowell also spread the ultra-modernists' experimental creed as a highly regarded teacher of composition and theory—among his many students were [[George Gershwin]], [[Lou Harrison]], who said he thought of Cowell as "the mentor of mentors,"&lt;ref&gt;[http://musicmavericks.publicradio.org/features/interview_harrison.html "An interview with Lou Harrison"] interview by Alan Baker, June 2002; part of the American Public Media/''American Mavericks'' website. Retrieved 4/14/07.&lt;/ref&gt; and John Cage, who proclaimed Cowell "the open sesame for new music in America."&lt;ref&gt;Cage (1959), p. 71.&lt;/ref&gt;

Encouragement of the music of Caturla and Roldán, with their proudly African-based rhythms, and of Chávez, whose work often involved instruments and themes of [[Indigenous peoples of Mexico|Mexico's indigenous peoples]], was natural for Cowell. Growing up on the West Coast, he had been exposed to a great deal of what is now known as "[[world music]]"; along with Irish airs and dances, he encountered music from China, Japan, and Tahiti. These early experiences helped form his unusually eclectic musical outlook, exemplified by his famous statement "I want to live in the whole world of music."&lt;ref&gt;Quoted in Nicholls (1991), p. 134.&lt;/ref&gt; He went on to investigate [[Indian classical music]] and, in the late 1920s, began teaching a course, "Music of the World's Peoples," at the [[New School for Social Research]] in New York and elsewhere—Harrison's tutelage under Cowell would begin when he enrolled in a version of the course in [[San Francisco, California|San Francisco]]. In 1931 a [[Guggenheim fellowship]] enabled Cowell to go to Berlin to study comparative musicology (the predecessor to [[ethnomusicology]]) with [[Erich von Hornbostel]]. He studied [[Carnatic music|Carnatic theory]] and [[gamelan]], as well, with leading instructors from South India (P. Sambamoorthy), Java (Raden Mas Jodjhana), and Bali (Ramaleislan).&lt;ref&gt;Harrison (1997), p. 166; [http://www.sc.edu/library/music/hc_bio.html "Cowell, Henry"] essay by David Nicholls, from ''The New Grove Dictionary of Music Online''; part of the Music Library of The University of South Carolina website.

==Imprisonment==
[[Image:Sidney Robertson Cowell NYWTS.jpg|thumb|175px|right|[[Sidney Robertson Cowell]]]]
In May 1936, Cowell was arrested on a "morals" charge for allegedly having oral sex with a seventeen-year-old boy. After initially denying the allegation, under questioning he admitted not only to it but to additional sex acts with the teenager and his male friends. While jailed awaiting a court hearing, he wrote a full confession accompanied by a request for leniency on the basis that "he was not exclusively homosexual but was in fact in love with a woman he hoped to marry".&lt;ref&gt;Hicks (2002), p. 134. See also Miller and Collins (2005), pp. 473–76.&lt;/ref&gt; The charge was not dropped and Cowell, overruling his attorneys, pled guilty; probation was denied, and he received the standard sentence of one to fifteen years.&lt;ref&gt;Hicks (2002), pp. 135–36.&lt;/ref&gt; In August 1937, after a parole hearing, the board of pardons fixed his term of incarceration at the maximum decade-and-a-half.&lt;ref&gt;Miller and Collins (2005), pp. 476, 482.&lt;/ref&gt;

Cowell would ultimately spend four years in [[San Quentin State Prison]].&lt;ref name=glbtq&gt;{{cite web|last=Krinsky |first=Charles |work=[[glbtq.com]] |year=2002 |accessdate=2007-08-16 |url=http://www.glbtq.com/arts/cowell_h.html |title=Cowell, Henry |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071009222533/http://www.glbtq.com/arts/cowell_h.html |archivedate=2007-10-09 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; There he taught fellow inmates, directed the prison band, and continued to write music at his customary prolific pace, producing around sixty compositions,&lt;ref&gt;Boziwick (2000).&lt;/ref&gt; including two major pieces for percussion ensemble: the Oriental-toned ''Pulse'' (1939) and the memorably sepulchral ''Return'' (1939). He also continued his experiments in aleatory music: for all three movements of the ''Amerind Suite'' (1939), he wrote five versions, each more difficult than the last. Interpreters of the piece are invited to simultaneously perform two or even three versions of the same movement on multiple pianos. In the Ritournelle (Larghetto and Trio) (1939) for the dance piece ''Marriage at the Eiffel Tower'', performing in Seattle, he explored what he called "elastic" form. The twenty-four measures of the Larghetto and the eight of the Trio are each modular; though Cowell offers some suggestions, any hypothetically may be included or not and played once or repeatedly, allowing the piece to stretch or contract at the performers' will—the practical goal being to give a choreographer freedom to adjust the length and character of a dance piece without the usual constraints imposed by a prewritten musical composition.&lt;ref&gt;Nicholls (1991), p. 167.&lt;/ref&gt;

Cowell had contributed to the ''Eiffel Tower'' project at the behest of Cage, who was not alone in lending support to his friend and former teacher. Cowell's cause had been taken up by composers and musicians around the country, although a few, including Ives, broke contact with him. Cowell was eventually paroled in 1940; he relocated to the East Coast and the following year married [[Sidney Robertson Cowell|Sidney Hawkins Robertson]] (1903–1995, married name Sidney Robertson Cowell), a prominent folk-music scholar who had been instrumental in winning his freedom. Cowell was granted a pardon in 1942.

==Late career==
Despite the pardon—which allowed him to work at the Office of War Information, creating radio programs for broadcast overseas—arrest, incarceration, and attendant notoriety had a devastating effect on Cowell. [[Conlon Nancarrow]], on meeting him for the first time in 1947, reported, "The impression I got was that he was a terrified person, with a feeling that 'they're going to get him.'"&lt;ref name="Quoted in Gann 1995, p. 44"&gt;Quoted in Gann (1995), p. 44.&lt;/ref&gt; The experience took a lasting toll on his music: Cowell's compositional output became strikingly more conservative soon after his release from San Quentin, with simpler rhythms and a more traditional harmonic language. Many of his later works are based on [[old-time music|American folk music]], such as the series of eighteen ''Hymn and'' [[fuguing tune|''Fuguing Tune'']]s (1943–64); folk music had certainly played a role in a number of Cowell's prewar compositions, but the provocative transformations that had been his signature were now largely abandoned. And, as Nancarrow observed, there were other consequences to Cowell's imprisonment: "Of course, after that, politically, he kept his mouth completely shut. He had been radical politically, too, before."&lt;ref name="Quoted in Gann 1995, p. 44"/&gt;

No longer an artistic radical, Cowell nonetheless retained a progressive bent and continued to be a leader (along with Harrison and McPhee) in the incorporation of non-Western musical idioms, as in the Japanese-inflected ''Ongaku'' (1957), Symphony No. 13, "[[Madras Symphony|Madras]]" (1956–58) (which had its premiere in the eponymous city), and ''Homage to Iran'' (1959). His most compelling, poignant songs date from this era, including ''Music I Heard'' (to a poem by [[Conrad Aiken]]; 1961) and ''Firelight and Lamp'' (to a poem by Gene Baro; 1962). Despite the break in his friendship with Ives, Cowell, in collaboration with his wife, wrote the first major study of Ives's music and provided crucial support to Harrison as his former pupil championed the Ives rediscovery. Cowell resumed teaching—[[Burt Bacharach]], [[J. H. Kwabena Nketia]], and [[Irwin Swack]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dwightwinenger.net/swack.htm Irwin Swack Music]&lt;/ref&gt; were among his postwar students—and served as a consultant to [[Folkways Records]] for over a decade beginning in the early 1950s, writing liner notes and editing such collections as ''Music of the World's Peoples'' (1951–61) (he also hosted a radio program of the same name)&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mcphersonco.com/cs.php?f%5B0%5D=shh&amp;pdNM=Essential%20Cowell:%20Selected%20Writings%20on%20Music ''Essential Cowell: Selected Writings on Music''] publisher's summary; part of the McPherson &amp; Co. website. Retrieved 4/14/07.&lt;/ref&gt; and ''Primitive Music of the World'' (1962). In 1963 he recorded searching, vivid performances of twenty of his seminal piano pieces for a Folkways album. Perhaps liberated by the passage of time and his own seniority, in his final years Cowell again produced a number of individualistic works, such as ''Thesis'' (Symphony No. 15; 1960) and ''26 Simultaneous Mosaics'' (1963).

Cowell was elected to the [[The American Academy of Arts and Letters|American Institute of Arts and Letters]] in 1951. He died in 1965 in [[Shady, New York]], after a series of illnesses.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3119">'''Herzbaracke''' is a [[Switzerland|Swiss]] cabaret-theatre in the cantons of [[Canton of St. Gallen|St. Gallen]] and [[Canton of Zürich|Zürich]] provided on a watercraft on [[Zürichsee]]. ''Herzbaracke'' is a Swiss German language linguistic joke meaning either "heart barracks" or "heart attack".
[[File:Herzbaracke - Utoquai - Sechseläutenplatz-Opernhaus - Quaibrücke 2015-03-13 17-02-54.JPG|thumb|upright|Herzbaracke at [[Utoquai]] in Zürich, [[Sechseläutenplatz]] in the background.]]

== History ==
The project started as an alternative culture program in 1998. Based in [[Seefeld (Zürich)]], the two people who initiated and provide the ''Herzbaracke'' want to show "genuine art". Typical for the small theater are graphics and postcards in the [[Art Nouveau]] style as a reminiscence of the turn of the century. The ''Barke'', a raft-like vessel type without masts and engine, is due to this setting, lined with pine wood and lit by oil lamps, and decorated with barrel organs and musical boxes.&lt;ref name="nzz"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nzz.ch/zuerich/zuercher_kultur/robbie-williams-und-der-schwimmende-salon-1.18415220|title=Robbie Williams und der schwimmende Salon|publisher=Neue Zürcher Zeitung NZZ|author=Katja Baigger|language=German|date=2014-10-24|accessdate=2015-02-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Program ==
On the first floor there is a mini-salon full of Art Nouveau pictures where poems of Schiller, Novalis, Hölderlin and Heine are recited, and that may be booked at lunchtime for events with a magician for private parties. Before the nightly shows at 20:30 clock, on request a dinner can be taken that authentically is served by ladies who wear five petticoats under their skirts. In the initial phase, the program was cabaret and theater oriented; today it's more musical oriented, and so [[Edith Piaf]] chansons, [[Klezmer]] and Blues are played.&lt;ref name="nzz"/&gt;

Namely in the winter season, the theater is anchoring in the Zürichsee lake shore cities of [[Rapperswil]] (April), [[Stäfa]], [[Thalwil]] and [[Zürich]] (January to March) at [[Bellevueplatz]] at the [[Utoquai]]. The cabaret-oriented program schedule is combined with diners on board.&lt;ref name="herzbaracke-programm"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.herzbaracke.ch/ecm/ecm.cgi?c=programm.html|title=Die Herzbaracke auf Tournee|publisher=Herzbaracke|author=|language=German|date=|accessdate=2015-02-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Jesus Christ Superstar (1972 Swedish cast)'''''  is an album released on [[Philips Records |Philips]] in 1972. The album features the Swedish cast from [[Andrew Lloyd Webber]] and [[Tim Rice]]'s rock opera, [[Jesus Christ Superstar]]. Jesus was originally performed by Peter Winsnes on the Swedish opening at the Scandinavium arena in Göteborg. On tour as well as at the Johanneshov arena in Stockholm Jesus was played by Bruno Wintzell, who also sings the part of Jesus at the Swedish cast's studio recording. Among other artists were featured in the Swedish cast by their respective roles: Arne Jansson as Judas, Örjan Ramberg as Herodes, Bernt Henziger as Pilatus, and [[Agnetha Fältskog]] as Maria Magdalena.

==The Maria Magdalena role==
Björn Ulvaeus, Agnetha's husband at the time, had heard about the Swedish production, he suggested that Agnetha should audition for the role of Mary Magdalene. The producers had a hard time choosing between Agnetha and Titti Sjöblom, due to the respect of Titti's mother, famous singer [[Alice Babs]]. In what was termed a compromise, Agnetha headlined in the role against Peter Winsnes as Jesus, with Sjöblom playing two nights and the matinee was performed by Adele Lipuma as Maria Magdalena. Titti Sjöblom, playing Maria Magdalena and Bruno Winzell as Jesus went to perform on tour at Örebro and Gävle, after a compromise was made. In Stockholm Agnetha Fältskog returned as Maria Magdalena, with Bruno Winzell as Jesus. Peter Winsnes went back to the Falconér Theatre and picked up his utterly successful performance in Copenhagen again. The Danish daily paper Politiken crowned him the SUPER-SUPERSTAR! 

The premiere was held on February 18 at The Scandinavium arena in [[Gothenburg]] and the ten performances run set an "untouchable Swedish record" playing to 74,000 people, at the time of the year.

"'''King of Spain'''" (sometimes written as "'''The King of Spain'''") is a song by Canadian musical group [[Moxy Früvous]], and was the second independent song to hit number one in Canada, after [[The Barenaked Ladies]]' "[[Be My Yoko Ono]]".

The song first appeared on their [[Moxy Früvous (album)|self-titled independent cassette release]] in 1992. It was re-recorded for their 1993 major-label debut album, ''[[Bargainville]]''. Two live versions were also released on 1998's ''[[Live Noise (album)|Live Noise]]''.

The song is essentially a modern re-telling of ''[[The Prince and the Pauper]]''; it tells the story of a dethroned [[Spanish monarchy|Spanish monarch]], who, after switching places with an identical [[peasant]] friend, comes to Canada and gets a [[minimum wage]] job at [[Pizza Pizza]]. He also mentions working as a turf vacuumer at [[SkyDome]] and a [[Ice resurfacer|Zamboni]] driver at [[Maple Leaf Gardens]] (or [[Montreal Forum]] in the indie tape version). The song is narrated by the King, who, throughout the song, tells of the things he did as king and what he would do if he ran Canada. He also suggests that world leaders such as [[Bill Clinton]] and [[Boris Yeltsin]] should call him if they need help running their countries.

While the song is mostly [[a cappella]], there are some percussion instruments (such as [[conga]] and shaker) providing accompaniment. The band dubbed this style "quasi-a cappella". The lead vocal is performed by Dave Matheson (who wears a "King of Spain" hat while performing the song live), with [[Jian Ghomeshi]], [[Mike Ford (musician)|Mike Ford]] and Murray Foster performing backup.

As with most of their other songs, the band is known to change it when performing it live. The song is faster and the first chorus is usually performed with no accompaniment, with the callbacks usually being changed to spoken [[improvisation]]s. The spoken vocals in the second verse ("There's a roof overhead&amp;nbsp;/ and food on our plates") is usually improvised by Foster and Ghomeshi (examples: "There's a roof overhead&amp;nbsp;/ And [[poutine]] on my face!"; "There's a [[Coneheads|cone on your head]]&amp;nbsp;/ Bonita!"). The "[[Toronto Maple Leafs|Leafs]] call me up to drive the Zamboni" line is usually changed to represent a local sports team in the city they are performing in. The "some of you are probably wondering..." spoken section is usually extended. The end of the song is usually [[segue (music)|segued]] into the unreleased song "Green Eggs and Ham." The band is also known to play a [[grunge]] version of the song (known as the "Cranky Monarch Version" or "Grunge of Spain"), which is featured on ''Live Noise''.

A video of the song was made in 1992, and features the band [[busking]] outside the [[Bloor Cinema]] with Matheson as the King. It also features an "audience" made up of local celebrities such as [[Ed Mirvish]] and [[Daniel Richler]].

[[The Johnstones]], a Canadian ska band, often cover this song during their live shows.

A '''letterer''' is a member of a team of [[comic book creator]]s responsible for drawing the comic book's text. The letterer's use of [[typeface]]s, [[calligraphy]], letter size, and [[page layout|layout]] all contribute to the impact of the comic. The letterer crafts the comic's [[lettering|"display lettering"]]: the story title lettering and other special captions and credits that usually appear on a story's first page. The letterer also writes the letters in the [[word balloon]]s and draws in [[onomatopoeia|sound effects]]. Many letterers also design logos for the comic book company's various titles.

== History ==

=== Origins ===
By the time comic books came of age in the 1940s, the huge volume of work demanded by publishers had encouraged an assembly-line process, dividing the creative process into distinct tasks: writer, [[penciller]], letterer, [[inker]], and [[colorist]]. By the late 1940s, it became possible to make a living just lettering comic strips and comic books for artists, studios, and companies that didn't have the time or desire to do it in-house. The career of freelance letterer was born, and by the 1950s, letterers such as [[Gaspar Saladino]], [[Sam Rosen (comics)|Sam Rosen]], and [[Ben Oda]] were crafting full-time careers as letterers for [[DC Comics]], [[Marvel Comics]], and [[King Features Syndicate|King Features]].&lt;ref&gt;Klein, Todd. [http://kleinletters.com/LetteringTop.html "How it all began," Todd Klein: Lettering – Logos – Design.] Retrieved July 22, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!-- [[Image:SandmanEndless.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Four panels from ''[[The Sandman (Vertigo)|Sandman]]'' #21, demonstrating multiple [[Harvey Award]]-winning letterer Todd Klein's different styles for members of [[Endless (comics)|The Endless]].]] --&gt;

Letterer and logo designer [[Ira Schnapp]] defined the DC Comics look for nearly thirty years. Starting in 1940, he designed or refined such iconic logos as ''[[Action Comics]]'', ''[[Superman (comic book)|Superman]]'', ''[[The Flash (comic book)|The Flash]]'', and ''[[Justice League of America]]'', while also creating the distinctive appearance of DC's house ads and promotions. (Schnapp also designed the [[Comics Code Authority]] seal, which was a fixture on comic book covers from all major companies for over forty years.)&lt;ref name="chill"&gt;Kimball, Kirk. [http://www.dialbforblog.com/archives/376/ "The Big Chill," Dial B for Blog #376 (Oct. 10, 2006).] Retrieved July 21, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

Starting in around 1966, Schnapp's classic, art deco-inspired look was replaced by the pulsing, organic style of [[Gaspar Saladino]], who redesigned DC's house style for the [[counterculture]] era.&lt;ref name="BDS"&gt;B.D.S.

Retrieved July 20, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; – hired him to design logos for their entire line of titles.

From the 1930 through the 1990s (with a few exceptions), the letterer plied his craft on the same page drawn by the penciler. (The penciled art was then inked after the letterer has completed his work on the page.) At DC Comics during the "[[Silver Age of Comic Books|Silver Age]]" of the 1960s, pencilers were required to "rough in balloons and sound effects" for the letterers to later go over. An accomplished letterer was able to adapt his or her style to the style of the art for that particular book.&lt;ref&gt;Letterer [[Clem Robins]], quoted in Kimball, Kirk.

=== Computer lettering ===
The evolution of desktop publishing powered by computers, especially those made by [[Apple Inc.|Apple]], began in the 1980s, and started having a gradual impact on comics lettering soon after. One of the first users of computer-generated lettering was writer/artist [[John Byrne (comics)|John Byrne]], who made fonts from existing lettering. (Incidentally, Byrne made use of existing lettering by other artists, such as [[Dave Gibbons]], without their permission.&lt;ref name="computer"&gt;Klein, Todd. [http://kleinletters.com/ComputerLettering.html "Computer lettering," Todd Klein: Lettering – Logos – Design.] Retrieved July 23, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; Now Byrne uses a computer font based on the handwriting of letterer [[Jack Morelli]] – with Morelli's permission.)&lt;ref name="FAQProcess"&gt;Byrne Robotics FAQ: [http://www.byrnerobotics.com/FAQ/listing.asp?ID=6&amp;T1=Creative+Process Creative Process]. Retrieved December 2, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt; Other early users of computer lettering were [[David Cody Weiss]]&lt;ref name="computer" /&gt; and [[Roxanne Starr]], who experimented in computer lettering with [[Bob Burden]]'s ''[[Flaming Carrot Comics]]''.

Computer lettering really started making an impact with the availability of the first commercial comic book font, "Whizbang" (created by Studio Daedalus) around 1990.

In the early 1990s letterer [[Richard Starkings]] and his partner [[John Roshell]] (formerly Gaushell) began creating comic book fonts and started [[Comicraft]], which has since become the major source of comics fonts (though they have competition from others, such as [[Blambot]]).

In deference to tradition, at first computer lettering was printed out and pasted onto the original artwork, but after a few years, as comics coloring also moved to desktop publishing, digital lettering files began to be used in a more effective way by combining them directly with digital art files, eliminating the physical paste-up stage altogether. [[Wildstorm Comics]] was ahead of the curve, Marvel came around a few years later, and DC held to traditional production methods the longest, but now nearly all lettering is digitally applied.&lt;ref name="computer" /&gt;

In the early years of the 21st Century, the mainstream American comics companies moved almost exclusively to in-house computer lettering, effectively ending the era of the freelance letterer.&lt;ref name="Contino" /&gt; [[Chris Eliopoulos]] designed the fonts for Marvel's in-house lettering unit, and [[Ken Lopez]] did the same at DC.&lt;ref name="Contino"&gt;Contino, Jennifer. [http://www.comicon.com/cgi-bin/ultimatebb.cgi?ubb=get_topic&amp;f=36&amp;t=001693 "ABCs with Orzechowski," Comicon.com: The Pulse (Dec. 30, 2003). Retrieved July 17, 2008.] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080926133441/http://www.comicon.com/cgi-bin/ultimatebb.cgi?ubb=get_topic&amp;f=36&amp;t=001693 |date=September 26, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Since then the trend has swung the other way, with most comics publishers once again using freelance letterers rather than in-house staff. Nearly all use computer and digital comic book fonts.

== Tools and methods ==

=== On-the-board ===
The traditional comic book letterer needs little more than a [[lettering guide]], a pen or brush, [[India ink]], and white paint for corrections. Some situations required the letterer to use [[vellum]] overlays on top of the original art.&lt;ref name="Gaspar Saladino — Atlas Shrugged!"/&gt;

=== EC Comics ===
The lettering in the comics of the sensationalist [[horror comics]] publisher [[EC Comics]] c. 1945–c. 1955 was different from other publishers — its mechanical appearance gave it a sterile aspect, and helped define the particular style of comics EC was known for. EC's letterers achieved their particular look by using a Leroy lettering set, a device popular amongst draftsmen and architects. The Leroy lettering set consisted of a stylus and a [[pantographic]] lettering form.&lt;ref&gt;Burns, Casey. [http://caseyburns.com/artwork/font-design/ "Squa Tront and Spa Fon (2001),"] Casey Burns official website. Accessed May 21, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Computer lettering ===
Most Marvel and DC books are now lettered using a graphics program such as [[Adobe Illustrator]] or [[Adobe Photoshop]], and a [[font]] that resembles hand lettering. Computer lettering provides a lot of technical shortcuts, especially by combining the lettering work directly with digital art files, eliminating the tedious physical paste-up stage altogether.

There are also still comics artists and inkers who prefer to have the lettering directly on their pages. First, it saves drawing time (not having to put art where a big caption will be); and second, comics tell a story, and a page of comics art without the lettering is only half the story.

Long-time letterer [[John Workman]] toes a middle ground between traditional and digital lettering. In addition to his "on-the-art boards work," Workman has been electronically hand-lettering by way of a [[Wacom (company)|Wacom]] tablet.

== Awards and recognition ==
Both the [[Eisner Award]]s and the [[Harvey Award]]s feature a "best letterer" category. (The [[Shazam Award]]s also had a "best letterer" category until the Awards' demise in 1975.) Since the creation of the Eisner and Harvey lettering awards (in 1993 and 1992, respectively), [[Todd Klein]] has dominated the Eisner, winning fifteen times, and has come away with the Harvey eight times. Other repeat Harvey Award winners include [[Ken Bruzenak]], [[Chris Ware]], [[John Workman]], and [[Dan Clowes]].

The '''Leverian collection''' was a natural history and ethnographic collection assembled by [[Ashton Lever]]. It was noted in particular for the content it acquired from the voyages of Captain [[James Cook]]. For three decades it was on display in [[London]], being broken up by auction in 1806.

The first public location of the collection was the '''Holophusikon''' (or '''Holophusicon'''), also known as the '''Leverian Museum''', at [[Leicester Square|Leicester House]], on [[Leicester Square]] in London, England, from 1775 to 1786. After it passed from Lever's ownership, it was displayed for nearly 20 years more near the south end of [[Blackfriars Bridge]]. When there it was often known as the '''Museum Leverianum'''.

==At Alkrington==
Lever collected fossils, shells, and animals (birds, insects, reptiles, fish, monkeys) for many years, accumulating a large collection at his home at [[Alkrington]], near [[Manchester]].  He was swamped with visitors, whom he allowed to view his collection for free, so much so that he had to insist that visitors that arrived on foot would not be admitted.  He decided to exhibit the collection in London as a commercial venture, charging an entrance fee.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.archerylibrary.com/books/badminton/docs/chapter14/chapter14_1.html Chapter 14, ''The Royal Toxophilite Society''], By Colonel Walrond, part of The Badminton Library of Sports and Pastimes: Archery (1894)&lt;/ref&gt;

==At Leicester House==

Taylor|page=72|edition=1st|url=https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Animals_drawn_from_Nature_and_engraved_in_aqua-tinta#plate35}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]
Lever acquired a lease of Leicester House in 1774, converting the principal rooms on the first floor into a single large gallery running the length of the house, and opened his museum in February 1775, with around 25,000 exhibits (a small fraction of his collection) valued at over £40,000.&lt;ref name="bho"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bopcris.ac.uk/bop1688/ref1572.html Abstract of a Petition of Sir Ashton Lever] for a Bill to enable him to dispose of his museum. {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070929090635/http://www.bopcris.ac.uk/bop1688/ref1572.html |date=29 September 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The display included many natural and ethnographic items gathered by Captain [[James Cook]] on his voyages.&lt;ref name="empire"&gt;[http://www.arthurlloyd.co.uk/Archive/May2004/Page1.htm History of the Empire Theatre] (built on the site of [[Leicester Square|Leicester House]]). {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140222031849/http://www.arthurlloyd.co.uk/Archive/May2004/Page1.htm|date=22 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The museum took its name from its supposedly universal coverage of [[natural history]],&lt;ref name="bho"&gt;[http://www.british-history.ac.uk/report.asp?compid=41120 ''Survey of London: volumes 33 and 34: St Anne Soho''] (1966), pp. 441-72, from British History Online&lt;/ref&gt; and was essentially a huge [[cabinet of curiosities]].

Lever charged an entry fee of 5s. 3d., or two [[Guinea (British coin)|guineas]] for an annual ticket, and the museum had a degree of commercial success; the receipts in 1782 were £2,253.&lt;ref name="bho"/&gt;  In an effort to draw in the crowds, Lever later reduced the entrance fee to half a crown (2s. 6d.)&lt;ref name="bho"/&gt;&lt;ref name="empire"/&gt; and was constantly looking for new exhibits.  He also set out his exhibits to impress the visitor, as well as (unusually) including educational information.  However, he spent more on new exhibits than he raised in entrance fees.

One admirer of the museum was [[Philip Bury Duncan]] as a boy: he went on to become keeper of the [[Ashmolean Museum]].&lt;ref&gt;{{ODNBweb|id=8229|title=Duncan, Philip Bury|first=Alan|last=Bell}}&lt;/ref&gt; Among the objects displayed was the large [[Viking]] silver [[thistle brooch]] from the [[Penrith Hoard]], discovered by a boy in [[Cumbria]] in 1785.  In 1787, a print of it was published, claiming that it was the insignia of the [[Knights Templar]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.britishmuseum.org/explore/online_tours/britain/enlightenment_archaeology/silver_thistle_brooch.aspx British Museum] ''Enlightenment: The Birth of Archaeology, Silver 'thistle' brooch''. {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110213230940/https://www.britishmuseum.org/explore/online_tours/britain/enlightenment_archaeology/silver_thistle_brooch.aspx |date=13 February 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It was bought by the [[British Museum]] in 1909 (M&amp;ME 1909,6-24,2).

==Lottery for the collection==
The British Museum and [[Catherine II of Russia]] both refused to buy the collection, so Lever obtained an [[Act of Parliament]] in 1784 to sell the whole by [[lottery]].  He only sold 8,000 tickets at a guinea each - he had hoped to sell 36,000.&lt;ref name="empire"/&gt;

The collection was acquired by [[James Parkinson (1730–1813)|James Parkinson]], a land agent and accountant.&lt;ref name="bho"/&gt;  It continued to be displayed at Leicester House until Lever's death in 1788, at a reduced entrance fee of one shilling.&lt;ref name="empire"/&gt;

==Move south of the Thames==
{{details|Blackfriars Rotunda}}
Parkinson transferred the Leverian collection to a purpose-built [[Blackfriars Rotunda|Rotunda building]], at what would later be No. 3 [[Blackfriars Road]]. Leicester House itself was demolished in 1791.&lt;ref name="bho"/&gt;&lt;ref name="empire"/&gt;

A catalogue and guide was printed in 1790.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Leverian Museum (London, England)|title=A companion to the museum, (late Sir Ashton Lever's): removed to Albion Street, the Surry end of Black Friars Bridge|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=zvVbAAAAQAAJ|accessdate=14 March 2012|year=1790|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Parkinson also had [[George Shaw]] write an illustrated scientific work;&lt;ref&gt;''Museum Leverianum containing select specimens from the museum of Sir Ashton Lever'' (1792-1796).&lt;/ref&gt; the artists involved included [[Philip Reinagle]], [[Charles Reuben Ryley]], [[William Skelton]], [[Sarah Stone (artist)|Sarah Stone]], and [[Sydenham Edwards]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.racollection.org.uk/ixbin/indexplus?_IXSESSION_=DsUa4hVj50K&amp;_IXSR_=&amp;_IXACTION_=display&amp;_MREF_=8231&amp;_IXSP_=1&amp;_IXFPFX_=templates/full/&amp;_IXSPFX_=templates/full/&amp;_IXTRAIL_=Academicians Royal Academy of Arts, ''Philip Reinagle, R.A. 1749 - 1833''.]  {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304060155/http://www.racollection.org.uk/ixbin/indexplus?_IXSESSION_=DsUa4hVj50K&amp;_IXSR_=&amp;_IXACTION_=display&amp;_MREF_=8231&amp;_IXSP_=1&amp;_IXFPFX_=templates%2Ffull%2F&amp;_IXSPFX_=templates%2Ffull%2F&amp;_IXTRAIL_=Academicians |date=4 March 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.org/details/museileverianiex121792shaw ''Musei Leveriani explicatio, anglica et latina'' (1792).]&lt;/ref&gt; Some of [[John White (surgeon)|John White]]'s specimens were put on public display there for the first time.&lt;ref&gt;[http://australianmuseum.net.au/The-Sarah-Stone-Collection Australian Museum, ''Sarah Stone Collection''.]&lt;/ref&gt; The museum also served as a resource and opportunity for women: [[Ellenor Fenn]] wrote ''A Short History of Insects'' (1796/7), for which the long title concludes as "a pocket companion to those who visit the Leverian Museum",&lt;ref&gt;''A short history of insects, (extracted from works of credit) designed as an introduction to the study of that branch of natural history, and as a pocket companion to those who visit the Leverian Museum.''; [http://www.worldcat.org/title/short-history-of-insects-extracted-from-works-of-credit-designed-as-an-introduction-to-the-study-of-that-branch-of-natural-history-and-as-a-pocket-companion-to-those-who-visit-the-leverian-museum/oclc/6655602 WorldCat ref].&lt;/ref&gt; and a similar volume on quadrupeds; the artist Sarah Stone continued to work for Parkinson, as she had done for Lever.&lt;ref&gt;Christa Knellwolf King, ''Frankenstein's Science: experimentation and discovery in Romantic culture, 1780-1830'' (2008), p. 173; [https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=sz4Yuz-E-EgC&amp;pg=PA173 Google Books].&lt;/ref&gt;

Parkinson had some success in getting naturalists to attend the museum, which was easier at the time to visit than the British Museum. A visitor in 1799, [[Heinrich Friedrich Link]], was complimentary.&lt;ref&gt;J. A. Bartle, [http://www.nzetc.org/tm/scholarly/tei-Bio32Tuat-t1-body-d9.html ''Differences between British and French Organization of Zoological Exploration in the Pacific 1793–1840''], Tuatara: Vol. 32, April 1993.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Disposal of the collection==
Parkinson also tried to sell the contents at various times. One attempt, a proposed purchase by the government, was wrecked by the adverse opinion of [[Sir Joseph Banks]].&lt;ref&gt;{{ODNBweb|id=21370|title=Parkinson, James (bap. 1730, d. 1813), land agent and museum proprietor|first=H. S.|last=Torrens}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the end, for financial reasons, Parkinson sold the collection in lots by auction in 1806.&lt;ref name="bho"/&gt; Among the buyers were [[Edward Donovan]], [[Edward Stanley, 13th Earl of Derby]], and [[William Bullock (collector)|William Bullock]]; many items went to other museums, including the [[Imperial Museum of Vienna]].&lt;ref&gt;[[s:Page:Ibis - Series 3 - Volume 3.djvu/36|The Ibis, Series 3, Volume 3]], Osbert Salvin, 1873, accessed 29 August 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

The contents of the museum are well recorded, from a catalogue of the museum created in 1784, and the sale catalogue in 1806, with a contemporary series of [[watercolour]]s of its contents by Sarah Stone.&lt;ref&gt;[http://australianmuseum.net.au/A-collection-of-drawings-by-Miss-Sarah-Stone A collection of drawings by Sarah Stone]&lt;/ref&gt; There are also sale catalogue annotations allowing, for example, the counting of 37 lots bought by [[Alexander Macleay]].&lt;ref&gt;Palma, R.L. 1991.

==Concept and creation==
[[File:Mario emblem.svg|150px|thumb|Seen on his hat, Mario's emblem represents him in the interfaces of many of the games in which he has appeared]]

[[Shigeru Miyamoto]] created Mario while developing ''[[Donkey Kong (video game)|Donkey Kong]]'' in an attempt to produce a best-selling video game for [[Nintendo]]; previous titles like ''[[Sheriff (arcade game)|Sheriff]]'' had not achieved the same success as titles like ''[[Pac-Man]]''. Originally, Miyamoto wanted to create a video game that used the characters [[Popeye]], [[Bluto]], and [[Olive Oyl]].&lt;ref name="ign" /&gt; At the time, however, Miyamoto was unable to acquire a license to use the characters (and would not until 1982 with ''[[Popeye (video game)|Popeye]]''), so he ended up making an unnamed player character, [[Donkey Kong (character)|Donkey Kong]], and [[Pauline (Nintendo)|Lady]] (later known as Pauline).&lt;ref name="ign" /&gt; In the early stages of ''Donkey Kong'', Mario was unable to jump, and the focus was to escape a maze. However, Miyamoto enabled Mario to jump, saying "If you had a barrel rolling towards you, what would you do?"&lt;ref name="wired"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.wired.com/gaming/gamingreviews/multimedia/2007/05/gallery_game_history?slide=18 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081020153928/http://www.wired.com/gaming/gamingreviews/multimedia/2007/05/gallery_game_history?slide=18 |dead-url=yes |archive-date=October 20, 2008 |title=Console Portraits: A 40-Year Pictorial History of Gaming |publisher=[[Wired News]] |author=Orlando, Greg |accessdate=August 23, 2008 |date=May 15, 2007 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="wii-com1"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://iwataasks.nintendo.com/interviews/#/wii/nsmb/0/0 |title=Iwata Asks: New Super Mario Bros. |work=Wii.com |publisher=[[Nintendo]] |accessdate=June 24, 2013 |page=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While the protagonist was unnamed in the Japanese release, he would be named '''Jumpman''' in the game's English instructions&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine|last=|first= |title=Mario: Alive, Well, and Living in the Bronx?|magazine=[[Next Generation (magazine)|Next Generation]] |issue=26|publisher=[[Imagine Media]]|date=February 1997|page=46}}&lt;/ref&gt; and '''Mario''' in the sales brochure.&lt;ref name=tafa_dkusflyer&gt;{{cite web|url=http://flyers.arcade-museum.com/?page=thumbs&amp;db=videodb&amp;id=316|title=Donkey Kong|website=The Arcade Flyers Archive}}&lt;/ref&gt; Miyamoto originally named the character "Mr. Video", and he was to be used in every video game Miyamoto developed.&lt;ref name="yahoo"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://videogames.yahoo.com/events/playback/playback-93/1378336|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091211223939/http://videogames.yahoo.com/events/playback/playback-93/1378336|archivedate=December 11, 2009|title=Playback 93|date=December 2, 2009|publisher=Yahoo|accessdate=December 24, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to a widely circulated story, during localization of ''Donkey Kong'' for American audiences, Nintendo of America's warehouse landlord [[Mario Segale]] confronted then-president [[Minoru Arakawa]], demanding back rent. Following a heated argument in which the Nintendo employees eventually convinced Segale he would be paid, they opted to name the character in the game Mario after him.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://technologizer.com/2010/04/25/mario/|title= The True Face of Mario |last= Edwards |first= Benj |date= April 25, 2010|work= [[Technologizer]] |accessdate=June 30, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title= Powerful Segale family has massive vision for Tukwila expanse |author= Eric Pryne |url= http://seattletimes.nwsource.com/html/businesstechnology/2011460764_segale28.html |newspaper= [[The Seattle Times]] |date= March 27, 2010 |accessdate=June 30, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Miyamoto commented that if he had named Mario "Mr. Video", Mario likely would have "disappeared off the face of the Earth".&lt;ref name="wii-com1"/&gt; By Miyamoto's own account, Mario's profession was chosen to fit with the game design. Since ''Donkey Kong'' was set on a construction site, Mario was made into a carpenter. When he appeared again in ''[[Mario Bros.]]'', it was decided he should be a plumber, since a lot of the game is played in underground settings.&lt;ref name="usatoday"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://content.usatoday.com/communities/gamehunters/post/2010/11/qa-mario-creator-shigeru-miyamoto/1|title=Q&amp;A: 'Mario' creator Shigeru Miyamoto|date=November 8, 2010|accessdate=November 9, 2010|author=Mike Snider|work=[[USA Today]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mario's character design, particularly his large nose, draws on western influences; once he became a plumber, Miyamoto decided to "put him in [[New York City|New York]]" and make him Italian,&lt;ref name="usatoday" /&gt; lightheartedly attributing Mario's nationality to his mustache.&lt;ref name="IGN Miyamoto Interview"&gt;{{cite news|last=Kohler|first=Chris|title=Q&amp;A: 90 Minutes With Miyamoto, Nintendo’s Master of Amusement|url=https://www.wired.com/gamelife/2008/06/interview-90-mi/|publisher=IGN.com|accessdate=July 30, 2010|date=June 27, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other sources have Mario's profession chosen to be carpenter in an effort to depict the character as an ordinary hard worker, and make it easier for players to identify with him.&lt;ref name="mariomania"&gt;[[Minoru Arakawa|Arakawa, Minoru]] (1991). Mario Mania. Nintendo. pp. 30–32. [[ASIN]] B000BPL42C.&lt;/ref&gt; After a colleague suggested that Mario more closely resembled a plumber, Miyamoto changed Mario's profession accordingly and developed ''Mario Bros.'',&lt;ref name="ign" /&gt; featuring the character in the sewers of New York City.&lt;ref&gt;Grajqevci, Jeton (October 9, 2000).

Due to the graphical limitations of arcade hardware at the time, Miyamoto clothed the character in red overalls and a blue shirt to contrast against each other and the background. A red cap was added to let Miyamoto avoid drawing the character's hairstyle, forehead, and eyebrows, as well as to circumvent the issue of animating his hair as he jumped.&lt;ref name="ign"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ign.com/articles/2010/09/14/ign-presents-the-history-of-super-mario-bros|title=IGN Presents: The History of Super Mario Bros.|author=McLaughlin, Rus|date=September 13, 2010|publisher=IGN|accessdate=June 24, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="usatoday" /&gt; To give distinctly human facial features on an 8×8 pixel head, Miyamoto drew a large nose and a mustache, which avoided the need to draw a mouth and facial expressions.&lt;ref name="CNN"&gt;Rao, Anjali (February 15, 2007).

Miyamoto envisioned a "go to" character that could be put into any game as needed, albeit in cameo appearances, as at the time Miyamoto was not expecting the character to become singularly popular.&lt;ref name="yahoo"/&gt; To this end, he originally called the character "Mr. Video", comparing his intent for appearances in later games to the cameos that [[Alfred Hitchcock]] had done within his films.&lt;ref name="wii-com2"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://iwataasks.nintendo.com/interviews/#/wii/nsmb/0/1 |title=Iwata Asks: New Super Mario Bros. |work=Wii.com |publisher=[[Nintendo]] |accessdate=June 24, 2013 |page=2}}&lt;/ref&gt; Over time, Mario's appearance has become more defined; blue eyes, white gloves, brown shoes, a red "M" in a white circle on the front of his hat and gold buttons on his overalls have been added. The colors of his shirt and overalls were also reversed from a blue shirt with red overalls to a red shirt with blue overalls. Miyamoto attributed this process to the different development teams and artists for each game as well as advances in technology.&lt;ref name="mariomania" /&gt;

==Surname==
Nintendo did not initially reveal Mario's full name. In a 1989 interview, his full name was stated not to be "Mario Mario" though it may be inferred from the title of the ''Mario Bros.'' series.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite episode |title=Inside Super Mario Bros |series=[[Inside Edition]] |first=Joel |last=Loy |network=[[CBS Television Distribution]] |airdate=1989}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first notable use of "Mario Mario" is in the [[Super Mario Bros.

===1981–1990===
[[File:MarioSMBWalk.gif|thumb|left|Mario's [[Sprite (computer graphics)|sprite]] animation from ''[[Super Mario Bros.]]'' (1985)]]

Mario debuted as "Jumpman" in the arcade game ''[[Donkey Kong (video game)|Donkey Kong]]'' on July 9, 1981.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Retro Diary |magazine=[[Retro Gamer]] |publisher=[[Imagine Publishing]] |location=Bournemouth |issue=104 |date=July 2012 |page=13 |issn=1742-3155 |oclc=489477015}}&lt;/ref&gt; He is shown to be a carpenter and has a pet ape called Donkey Kong.&lt;ref name="Kohler 39"&gt;{{cite book |title=Power-Up: How Japanese Video Games Gave the World an Extra Life |last=Kohler |first=Chris |year=2005 |publisher=Brady Games |isbn=0-7440-0424-1 |page=39 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The carpenter mistreats the ape and [[Donkey Kong (character)|Donkey Kong]] escapes to kidnap Jumpman's girlfriend, originally known as the Lady, but later named [[Recurring characters in the Mario series#Pauline|Pauline]]. The player must take the role of Jumpman and rescue the girl.

Jumpman was later renamed "Mario" in the 1982 arcade game ''[[Donkey Kong Junior (video game)|Donkey Kong Junior]]'', the only game in which he has been portrayed as an antagonist. In the 1983 arcade game ''[[Mario Bros.]]'', Mario and his younger brother [[Luigi]] are portrayed as [[Italian-American]]&lt;ref name="usatoday" /&gt; plumbers&lt;ref name="mbvc"&gt;{{cite web |title=Mario Bros. at Nintendo – Wii – Virtual Console |url=https://www.nintendo.com/games/detail/AN20FWaWbXNL-oWwUHwK0sMxrfq_plpD |publisher=[[Nintendo]] |accessdate=June 24, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; who have to defeat creatures that have been coming from the sewers below [[New York City]].

In ''[[Super Mario Bros.]]'' for the [[Nintendo Entertainment System]], Mario saves [[Princess Peach|Princess Toadstool]] (later known as Princess Peach) of the [[Mushroom Kingdom]] from [[Bowser (character)|King Koopa]].&lt;ref name="Booklet 7"&gt;{{cite book| title = Super Mario Bros. Instruction Booklet| section = | publisher = [[Nintendo|Nintendo of America]]| year = 1986}}&lt;/ref&gt; To save Princess Toadstool, Mario conquers the eight worlds of the Mushroom Kingdom by going to the castle in each to defeat a minion of King Koopa. To reach each castle, Mario battles through three sub-worlds by defeating King Koopa's henchmen. If Mario successfully fights his way through the castle and defeats the minion, he frees a [[Toad (Nintendo)|Mushroom Retainer]].{{citation needed|date=April 2018}} Inside the eighth castle, Mario has a final fight with King Koopa and frees Princess Toadstool. In ''[[Super Mario Bros. 2]]'', the player can choose between Mario, [[Luigi]], [[Toad (Nintendo)|Toad]], or [[Princess Peach]]. Each character possesses unique abilities (Luigi has stronger jumping ability, Toad can dig the fastest, and Peach can float), with Mario being the most well-rounded. In ''[[Super Mario Bros. 3]]'', Mario quests to save the rulers of seven kingdoms from [[Bowser (character)|Bowser]] and his children, the [[Koopalings]], and Mario travels across eight worlds to restore order to the Mushroom World and to rescue Princess Peach.&lt;ref name="Manual-2"&gt;{{cite book| title = Super Mario Bros. 3 Instruction Booklet| section = The Eight Kingdoms| publisher = [[Nintendo|Nintendo of America]]| date = February 12, 1990}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mario is introduced to new [[power-up]]s that augment his abilities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| journal = [[Nintendo Power]]| title = Super Mario Bros. 3: Strategy Guide on the Way| issue = 12|date=May–June 1990| pages = 94–95| publisher = [[Nintendo]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===1989–1995===
In ''[[Super Mario Land]]'', an alien named Tatanga appears, hypnotizes the inhabitants of an area called Sarasaland, and kidnaps its ruler, [[Princess Daisy (Nintendo)|Princess Daisy]]. Mario sets out to rescue her, traveling through the four geographical areas of Sarasaland and defeating Tatanga's minions along the way. He corners Tatanga in the skies of the Chai kingdom, bringing down the alien warship and rescuing Daisy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author=Nintendo | year=1989 | title=Super Mario Land Instruction Booklet | publisher=Nintendo of America, Inc. }}&lt;/ref&gt; In ''[[Super Mario World]]'', Mario and Luigi take [[Princess Peach]] for a vacation in Dinosaur World sometime after the events of ''[[Super Mario Bros. 3]]''; during the vacation, Peach is kidnapped by [[Bowser (character)|Bowser]]. Mario and Luigi meet the [[Yoshi]]s, dinosaurs that live in Dinosaur World, and they help rescue Peach by allowing Mario and Luigi to ride them.&lt;ref name="booklet"&gt;{{cite book|title=Super Mario World Instruction Booklet|publisher=Nintendo}}&lt;/ref&gt; In ''[[Super Mario Land 2: 6 Golden Coins]]'', whose events take place immediately after the original ''Super Mario Land'', Mario's evil counterpart [[Wario]] has put an evil spell over Mario Land while Mario was away in Sarasaland, renaming the area Wario Land. The inhabitants are brainwashed into thinking that Wario is their master and Mario is their enemy. Wario's motive behind this sudden attack was to take control over Mario's castle in order to have one of his own. To stop Wario, Mario finds the 6 Golden Coins throughout Mario Land and regains access to his castle. In ''[[Super Mario World 2: Yoshi's Island]]'', a [[stork]] carries Baby Mario and Baby Luigi across the sea, but the evil [[Magikoopa]] [[Kamek]] steals Baby Luigi, and Baby Mario falls onto an island called Yoshi's Island, home to Yoshis. After Mario meets the Yoshis, the group journeys through the game's six worlds to rescue Baby Luigi and the stork from Baby Bowser and Kamek.

In ''[[Super Mario Sunshine]]'', Mario, [[Toadsworth]], and [[Princess Peach]] take a vacation to Isle Delfino, a [[tropical island]]. A person resembling Mario, known as "Shadow Mario", vandalizes and pollutes the entire island using a magic [[paintbrush]]. The vandalism has caused the Shine Sprites to flee from the island's main city, Delfino Plaza, and blanket the island in darkness. Blamed for the mess, Mario is arrested by the island authorities and ordered to clean up Isle Delfino. Mario is equipped with FLUDD, a robotic [[Hose|hosing]] device invented by [[Professor E. Gadd]], which he uses to clean up the pollution and collect the Shine Sprites.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|year=2002 |title=Super Mario Sunshine instruction booklet |publisher=Nintendo |pages=20–23}}&lt;/ref&gt; Meanwhile, Peach is kidnapped by Shadow Mario, who reveals himself to be [[Bowser Jr.]], one of Bowser's children, having stolen the paintbrush from Professor E. Gadd. Mario eventually confronts Bowser and Bowser Jr. and rescues the princess. With the island cleaned up, Mario and Peach begin their vacation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite video game|quote=FLUDD: The vacation starts now! |title=Super Mario Sunshine |developer=Nintendo EAD |publisher=Nintendo |date=August 26, 2002 |platform=Nintendo GameCube}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After failing to prevent the princess from being kidnapped, Mario meets star-like creatures called Lumas and their companion, [[Rosalina (Mario)|Rosalina]]. Rosalina tells Mario that Bowser has stolen the Power Stars, the source of power for Rosalina's mobile [[observatory]], and has taken Peach to the center of the universe.

===Television===
The first appearance of Mario in other media than games was ''[[Saturday Supercade]]'', an animated television series produced by Ruby-Spears Productions in 1983.

Outside the original games, television shows, and film, Mario has influenced the creation of a line of licensed merchandise and has appeared in popular culture. The Nintendo Comics System series, along with the [[Nintendo Adventure Books]], were created due to Mario as well.{{citation needed|date=October 2014|reason=Nintendo Adventure Books article does not correlate this.}}

===Theme parks===
Mario will appear at [[Universal Studios Japan]] in [[Osaka]] in the upcoming section of [[Super Nintendo World]], which is scheduled to open in 2020 in time of the [[2020 Summer Olympics]] in [[Tokyo]]. One of the rides will be themed to ''[[Mario Kart]]''. [[Universal Parks &amp; Resorts]] also has plans to import Super Nintendo World to [[Universal Studios Hollywood]] in [[Los Angeles|Los Angeles, California]] and [[Universal Orlando]] Resort in [[Orlando, Florida]].

==Characteristics==
Mario is depicted as a portly plumber who lives in the fictional land of the [[Mushroom Kingdom]] with [[Luigi]], his younger, taller brother.&lt;ref name="ign" /&gt;&lt;ref name="mariobioign"/&gt;&lt;ref name="luigibioign"&gt;{{cite web| title = Luigi Biography| publisher = IGN| url = http://stars.ign.com/objects/924/924288_biography.html| accessdate = January 26, 2010| deadurl = yes| archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20090817041854/http://stars.ign.com/objects/924/924288_biography.html| archivedate = August 17, 2009| df = }}&lt;/ref&gt; In the television series and film, Mario and Luigi are originally from [[Brooklyn|Brooklyn, New York]].&lt;ref name="mariobioign"/&gt; Little is known of Mario's childhood, though the infant version of Mario, Baby Mario, first appeared in 1995 in ''[[Super Mario World 2: Yoshi's Island]]'', and has often appeared in Nintendo sports games since then. Baby Mario has a major role along with [[Luigi|Baby Luigi]] in ''[[Mario &amp; Luigi: Partners in Time]]'' and appears in ''[[Yoshi's Island DS]]''. He, along with the adult Mario, is voiced by [[Charles Martinet]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Charles Martinet: Voice Over|url=http://www.charlesmartinet.com/voiceover.html|accessdate=March 16, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Savage|first1=Mark|title=The actors hiding inside your video games|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/entertainment-arts-19664003|accessdate=July 3, 2017|publisher=BBC News}}&lt;/ref&gt; He wears a longsleeved red shirt, a pair of blue overalls with yellow buttons, brown shoes, white gloves and a red cap with a red "M" printed on a white circle.

===Relationships===

=={{anchor|Ground pound|Wall jump|Spin jump}}Abilities==
During the development of ''[[Donkey Kong (video game)|Donkey Kong]]'', Mario was known as ''Jumpman''.&lt;ref name="ign" /&gt; Jumping—both to access places and as an offensive move—is a common gameplay element in ''Mario'' games, especially the ''[[Super Mario]]'' series. By the time ''[[Super Mario RPG]]'' was released, jumping became such a signature act of Mario that the player was often tasked with jumping to prove to [[non-player character]]s that he was Mario. Mario's most commonly portrayed form of attack is jumping to stomp on the heads of enemies, first used in ''[[Super Mario Bros.]]'' This jump-stomp move may entirely crush smaller enemies on the stage, and usually deals damage to larger ones, sometimes causing secondary effects.&lt;ref name="ign" /&gt; This attack often enables Mario to knock the turtle-like [[Koopa Troopa]]s into or out of their shells, which can be used as weapons.&lt;ref name="ign" /&gt; Subsequent games have elaborated on Mario's jumping-related abilities. ''[[Super Mario World]]'' added the ability to spin-jump, which allows Mario to break blocks beneath him. The Game Boy version of ''[[Donkey Kong (Game Boy)|Donkey Kong]]'' allows Mario to jump higher with consecutive jumps, and perform a back-flip. In ''[[Super Mario 64]]'', Mario gains new jumping abilities such as a sideways somersault; a ground pound, which is a high-impact downward thrusting motion; and the "Wall Kick", which propels him upwards by kicking off walls.

===Power-ups===
[[File:Tanooki Mario.jpg|upright|thumb|Mario seen wearing the Tanooki Suit. The suit is derived from the Japanese raccoon dog, [[tanuki]].]]

Mario uses items, which give him various powers, and differ between the games he is in. The first power-up Mario used was the Hammer in ''[[Donkey Kong (video game)|Donkey Kong]]''.&lt;ref name="dkhist"&gt;{{cite web|last=Trueman |first=Doug |title=GameSpot Presents: The History of Donkey Kong |publisher=[[GameSpot]] |url=http://www.gamespot.com/gamespot/features/video/dk_history/p03.html |archiveurl=http://web.archive.bibalex.org/web/20010710164559/http://gamespot.com/gamespot/features/video/dk_history/p03.html |archivedate=July 10, 2001 |accessdate=January 1, 2010 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

''[[Super Mario Bros.]]'' introduced the basic three power-ups that have become staples for the series, especially the 2D games — the Super Mushroom, which causes Mario to grow larger; the Fire Flower, which allows Mario to throw [[fire]]balls; and the Starman, which gives Mario temporary [[Iddqd|invincibility]]. These powers have appeared regularly throughout the series.&lt;ref name="ign" /&gt; Throughout the series' history, there have been several kinds of Mushroom power-ups, including the [[1-up]] Mushroom, which gives Mario an extra life; the Poison Mushroom, which causes Mario to either shrink or die;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Suellentrop |first=Chris |url=http://www.slate.com/id/2177082/ |title=Super Mario Bros.: The Lost Levels reviewed. – By Chris Suellentrop – Slate Magazine |work=Slate |date=November 5, 2007 |accessdate=April 4, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; the Mega Mushroom, which causes Mario to grow very large; and the Mini Mushroom, which causes Mario to shrink.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Harris |first=Craig |url=http://uk.ds.ign.com/articles/705/705537p2.html |title=IGN: New Super Mario Bros.

A reoccurring power-up throughout the series is an item that gives Mario the ability of flight. The first of this type was introduced in ''[[Super Mario Bros. 3]]'': one power-up, which gives Mario a raccoon suit, is called the Super Leaf,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Provo |first=Frank |url=http://uk.gamespot.com/wii/action/supermariobros3/review.html |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090310191431/http://uk.gamespot.com/wii/action/supermariobros3/review.html |archivedate=March 10, 2009 |title=Super Mario Bros. 3 Review for Wii – GameSpot |publisher=Uk.gamespot.com |date=November 9, 2007 |accessdate=April 4, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;  while another is called the Tanooki Suit (a transliteration of [[tanuki]]) and grants Mario the ability to fly or turn into a statue.&lt;ref name="ignsuits"&gt;{{cite web| title = Top 10 Mario Suits| publisher = IGN| date = November 16, 2009| url = http://wii.ign.com/articles/104/1045630p1.html| accessdate = January 23, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; In ''[[Super Mario World]]'', an item called the Cape Feather was introduced that gave Mario a cape.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Navarro |first=Alex |url=http://uk.gamespot.com/wii/action/supermarioworldsnes/review.html |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070714100606/http://uk.gamespot.com/wii/action/supermarioworldsnes/review.html |archivedate=July 14, 2007 |title=Super Mario World for Wii Review – GameSpot |publisher=Uk.gamespot.com |date=February 9, 2007 |accessdate=April 4, 2009 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; In ''[[Super Mario Land 2: 6 Golden Coins]]'', a carrot was available that gave Mario rabbit ears that allowed him to fly,&lt;ref name="ignsuits" /&gt; and in ''[[Super Mario 64]]'', Mario could acquire an item called the Wing Cap, which temporarily gave him the ability of flight.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nintendo.com/games/detail/48czfMMYIp_0_alQYMIOS7sgrvUdDq1O |title=Super Mario 64 at Nintendo :: Wii :: Virtual Console :: Games |publisher=Nintendo.com |accessdate=June 24, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Super Mario Sunshine]]'' introduces a pump-water spraying device named "F.L.U.D.D.", which abilities included spraying water and hovering.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://uk.gamespot.com/gamecube/action/supermariosunshine/review.html?om_act=convert&amp;om_clk=gssummary&amp;tag=summary;read-review |archive-url=https://archive.is/20120716210856/http://uk.gamespot.com/gamecube/action/supermariosunshine/review.html?om_act=convert&amp;om_clk=gssummary&amp;tag=summary;read-review |dead-url=yes |archive-date=July 16, 2012 |title=Super Mario Sunshine Review for GameCube – GameSpot |publisher=Uk.gamespot.com |date=October 4, 2002 |accessdate=April 4, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''[[Super Mario Galaxy]]'' introduced new power-ups, including the Bee Mushroom, which turned Mario into a bee and allowed him to fly temporarily; the Boo Mushroom, which turned Mario into a ghost, allowing him to float and pass through walls; the Spring Mushroom, which encased Mario in a spring, allowing him to jump higher; and the Ice Flower, which allowed the player to temporarily walk on water and lava without sinking or taking damage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| title = Super Mario Galaxy Instruction Booklet| section = Mario's Special Moves | publisher = [[Nintendo|Nintendo of America]]| year = 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Super Mario Galaxy 2]]'' introduced more power ups, including the Cloud Flower which allows Mario to create platforms in midair and Rock Mario, which transforms Mario into a boulder that could be used to break through barriers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| title = Super Mario Galaxy 2 Instruction Booklet| section = Mario's Special Moves | publisher = [[Nintendo|Nintendo of America]]| year = 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''[[New Super Mario Bros. Wii]]'' updated the Ice Flower, which allows Mario to shoot ice balls that temporally freeze enemies; and introduced the Propeller Mushroom, which allows him to fly; as well as the Penguin Suit, which allows Mario to easily traverse ice and swim through water in addition to shooting ice balls. ''[[Super Mario 3D Land]]'' introduced the Boomerang Flower, which allows Mario to throw boomerangs at nearby enemies; and the Statue Leaf, which allows Mario to turn to a statue. In ''[[New Super Mario Bros. U]]'', a Super Acorn makes its debut. This transforms Mario to his new [[Flying squirrel]] form where he can glide and stick on walls. ''[[Super Mario 3D World]]'' introduced the Super Bell, which transforms Mario into his cat form as well as a Double Cherry to make multiple copies of himself.

The '''media of Bulgaria''' refers to [[mass media]] outlets based in [[Bulgaria]]. Television, magazines, and newspapers are all operated by both state-owned and for-profit corporations which depend on [[advertising]], [[subscription]], and other sales-related revenues. The [[Constitution of Bulgaria]] guarantees freedom of speech.
As a [[country in transition]], Bulgaria's media system is under transformation.

Bulgaria's media are generally deemed unbiased, although the state still dominates the field through the [[Bulgarian National Television]] (BNT), the [[Bulgarian National Radio]] (BNR), and the [[Bulgarian Telegraph Agency]]. Bulgarian media have a record of unbiased reporting, although they are deemed potentially at risk of political influence due to the lack of legislation to protect them.&lt;ref&gt;

|quote = Mass Media: In 2006 Bulgaria’s print and broadcast media generally were considered unbiased, although the government dominated broadcasting through the state-owned Bulgarian National Television (BNT) and Bulgarian National Radio (BNR) and print news dissemination through the largest press agency, the Bulgarian Telegraph Agency. [...]Human Rights: In the early 2000s, Bulgaria generally has been rated highly on the issue of human rights. However, some exceptions exist. Although the media have a record of unbiased reporting, Bulgaria’s lack of specific legislation protecting the media from state interference is a theoretical weakness.
}}
&lt;/ref&gt; The written media have no legal restrictions and newspaper publishing is entirely liberal.&lt;ref name="landscape"&gt;[http://www.ejc.net/media_landscape/article/bulgaria/ Media Landscape – Bulgaria] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100722014211/http://www.ejc.net/media_landscape/article/bulgaria/|date=July 22, 2010 }}, European Journalism Centre&lt;/ref&gt; The extensive freedom of the press means that no exact number of publications can be established, although some research put an estimate of around 900 print media outlets for 2006.&lt;ref name="landscape"/&gt; The largest-circulation daily newspapers include ''[[Dneven Trud]]'' and ''[[24 Chasa]]''.&lt;ref name="landscape"/&gt;

Non-printed media sources, such as [[television]] and [[radio]], are overseen by the Council for Electronic Media (CEM), an independent body with the authority to issue broadcasting licenses. Apart from a state-operated [[Bulgarian National Television|national television channel]], [[Bulgarian National Radio|radio station]] and the [[Bulgarian News Agency]], a large number of private television and radio stations exist. However, most Bulgarian media experience a number of negative trends, such as general degradation of media products, self-censorship and economic or political pressure.&lt;ref name="media"&gt;[http://www.soros.org/initiatives/media/articles_publications/publications/financial-crisis-media-20091201/bulgaria-20091201.pdf Footprint of Financial Crisis in the Media, Bulgaria Country Report] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110503185125/http://www.soros.org/initiatives/media/articles_publications/publications/financial-crisis-media-20091201/bulgaria-20091201.pdf|date=May 3, 2011 }}, Open Society Institute, December 2009&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Slavi's Show]]'' and ''[[Gospodari Na Efira]]'' are among the most popular TV programs, both having more than 1,000,000 views per show.&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.is/20120628220950/http://www.slusham.com/20-te-nay-gledani-predavaniya-sa-po-btv-bez-i.html 20-те най-гледани предавания са по bTV, без изключение!], slusham.com, January 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

Internet media are growing in popularity due to the wide range of available opinions and viewpoints, lack of censorship and diverse content.&lt;ref name="media"/&gt;

&lt;!--==History==--&gt;
==Legislative framework==
The main legislative base is the 1998 Radio and Television Act, amended several times since. Many issues still persist in the field&lt;ref&gt;e.g. "lack of sufficient guarantees for the independence of the regulatory body, insufficient expert knowledge and professionalism of the regulatory body, lack of transparency of the licensing procedures, lack of transparency of the ownership, issues related to the ways of funding and spending the sums which the Bulgarian National Television and the Bulgarian National Radio receive from the state budget, etc." Vesela Tabakova, [http://ejc.net/media_landscapes/bulgaria#link_198 Bulgaria #Media Legislation], ''EJC Media Landscapes'', circa 2010&lt;/ref&gt;
The EU 2007 Audiovisual Media Services Directive was transposed in Bulgarian law in 2010, including the requirements for cultural diversity.&lt;ref name=EJCmedia&gt;Vesela Tabakova, [http://ejc.net/media_landscapes/bulgaria#link_198 Bulgaria #Media Legislation], ''EJC Media Landscapes'', circa 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Defamation]] in Bulgaria is decriminalised but punishable with large fines. Government officials have filed suits against journalists in the past, though courts tend to favour the latter and preserve [[press freedom]].&lt;ref name=FH/&gt;
Legislation on [[access to information]] is fairly robust, although institutions may still improperly deny access and courts may act inconsistently on the issue.
Media concentration is an issue and ownership transparency is lacking. A law was adopted in 2014 to restrict media ownership from offshore tax haven-based companies.&lt;ref name=FH/&gt;

===Status and self-regulation of journalists===
Journalists in Bulgaria work on decreasing salaries and face job insecurity, making work conditions more and more conducive to self-censorship and unethical practices.&lt;ref name=FH/&gt;

Violation of ethical and professional standards is often reported, particularly in the print press.
Codes of Conduct for journalists have been drafted by several media and professional organizations after 1989, including the Union of Bulgarian Journalists, the Free Speech Forum and the Centre for Independent Journalism. In 2004 an Ethical Code of Bulgarian Media was drafted with support from EU experts, though it was rejected by part of the Bulgarian journalist scene.&lt;ref name=EJCjourno&gt;Vesela Tabakova, [http://ejc.net/media_landscapes/bulgaria#link_199 Bulgaria #Accountability systems], ''EJC Media Landscapes'', circa 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

The Ethics Committee for the Print Media and  the Ethics Committee for the Electronic Media were established in late 2005 after long debate, institutionalising mechanisms of self-regulation in the Bulgarian media sector.&lt;ref name=EJCjourno/&gt;

The [[New Bulgarian Media Group]] (NBMG), owned by [[Irina Krasteva]] and controlled by her son and MP [[Delyan Peevski]] has a long history of cross-partisan pro-governmental bias. In June 2014, a spat between Peevski and a bank owner spurred negative report on NBMG media that caused a [[bank run]] and forced the financial institute to temporarily close down.&lt;ref name=FH/&gt;

The [[European Parliament election, 2014 (Bulgaria)|2014 European elections]] and [[Bulgarian parliamentary election, 2014|parliamentary elections]] were closely followed by the media, but a large portion of the coverage consisted in unlabelled paid partisan content. Right-wing-affiliated print and broadcast media often carry [[hate speech]] against minorities and migrants.&lt;ref name=FH/&gt;

==Media outlets==
The Bulgarian media panorama is pluralistic, although media outlets remain influenced by the political and economic interests of their owners and main advertisers. The shrinking advertising market has made the media more and more dependent on state advertising and other subsidies, in particular for small local media outlets.&lt;ref name=FH/&gt;

===Print media===
{{see also|List of newspapers in Bulgaria|List of magazines in Bulgaria}}
Freedom of expression and free competition in the media market were introduced in Bulgaria after 1989. Newspaper publishing is not regulated by law, and no audit office or official record of the number of publications exist. Over 900 print media titles were estimated in 2007, but their number is today greatly reduced after the effects of the economic crisis. The nationally distributed dailies were 14 in 2009; circulation per capita is very low.

Peevski's [[New Bulgarian Media Group]] (NBMG) and the competitor [[Media Group Bulgaria Holding]] own most of the private newspapers.&lt;ref name=FH/&gt;

The dominant form on the market is that of "hybrid tabloids", combining both quality press and tabloid features, including scandalous reporting, such as the dailies ''[[Trud (Bulgarian newspaper)|Trud]]'' and ''[[24 Chasa]]'', published by the German [[WAZ-Mediengruppe]]). The convergence is due to the failure in establishing quality broadsheets newspapers, leading instead popular dailies to extend their reach and occupy their niche. Other widely distributed newspapers include ''[[Standart (newspaper)|Standart]]'', [[Novinar]], ''Express'', ''Monitor'', and ''[[Telegraph (Bulgarian newspaper)|Telegraph]]'' - the latter being the only one to increase its circulation during the crisis, due to a lower price. ''[[Dnevnik (Bulgarian newspaper)|Dnevnik]]'' is deemed the most trustworthy on business and economy, but has a low circulation, together with ''Pari'', edited by the Swedish [[Bonnier Group]]. Political newspapers include ''Douma'', of the [[Bulgarian Socialist Party]], and ''Ataka'' (lit. "Attack"), of the homonymous [[Attack (political party)|nationalist party]].&lt;ref name=EJCprint/&gt;

To complement revenues from sales and advertisement, which most often do not arrive at coverning production costs, Bulgarian newspapers rely on contributions from business circles and political parties, hence opening up to avenues for political and commercial influences.&lt;ref name=EJCprint/&gt;

The regional print press include 10 dailies in the main towns of the country, as well as local publications coming out from once to three times per week.&lt;ref name=EJCprint/&gt;

Weeklies include the business-oriented ''[[Capital (newspaper)|Kapital]]'' and ''Banker'', and the popular 168 Chassa and Politika, together with the specialised  Kultura. Yellow weeklies (''Show'', ''Weekend'', ''Galeria'') have recently entered the market. Magazines included around 100 titled in late 2009, including ''Tema'' and ''Praven Svyat''.&lt;ref name=EJCprint/&gt;

The Bulgarian print press market was totally dominated by the German WAZ group from 1996 onwards, both at national and local level. 
In December 2010 WAZ Mediagroup sold all its assets in Bulgaria to a joint venture between Austrian investors and local tycoons. Until then the company had owned the two largest daily newspapers Trud and 24 hours, the weekly newspaper 168 hours, and a large portfolio of magazines.

The ''New Bulgarian Media Group'', deemed close to the Turkish-minority [[Movement for Rights and Freedoms]] party emerged in 2007 and got own ''Monitor'', ''Express'', ''Telegraph'' (dailies), ''Politika'', ''Weekend'', ''Meridian Match'' (weeklies), the ''Borba'' newspaper and a publishing house (in the city of [[Veliko Turnovo]]).

===Radio broadcasting===
{{see also|List of radio stations in Bulgaria}}
From 1935 to 1989 there was a state monopoly on radio broadcasts in Bulgaria. After liberalization, the market now features a high number of private, national and local radio stations.&lt;ref name=EJCradio&gt;Vesela Tabakova, [http://ejc.net/media_landscapes/bulgaria#link_183 Bulgaria #Radio], ''EJC Media Landscapes'', circa 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

The sector is mainly controlled by four foreign groups: the [[Irish Communicorp]] Group, [[SBS Broadcasting]] Group (since 2007 part of [[ProSiebenSat.1 Media AG]]), US [[Emmis Communications]], and [[News Corporation]] Group (owned by [[Rupert Murdoch]]). A Bulgarian owner, Focus, joined them in late 2009. They overall control over 20 radio stations.&lt;ref name=EJCradio/&gt;

The two national-coverage radio stations are the [[Bulgarian National Radio]] (BNR), with two channels (''Horizont'' and ''Hristo Botev''), and the private [[Darik radio]]. BNP's ''Radio Bulgaria'' broadcasts abroad, as well as in 7 regional centres in the country.&lt;ref name=EJCradio/&gt;

===Television broadcasting===
{{Main|Television in Bulgaria}}
Television in Bulgaria was [[Timeline of the introduction of television in countries|introduced in 1959]]. Although the [[Bulgaria]]n media market is small, it is one of the most vibrant and highly competitive in [[Central and Eastern Europe]]. At the turn of the century, global players such as [[News Corporation]], [[Modern Times Group]], [[Central European Media Enterprises]] and [[Fox Broadcasting Company]] briefly entered and consequently exited the Bulgarian TV market due to shrinking revenues, political pressure and the effect of the global recession of 2008. 

Two of the leading TV stations, [[BTV (Bulgaria)|bTV]] and [[Nova television (Bulgaria)|Nova TV]], are foreign-owned. The third is the national public service broadcaster, [[Bulgarian National Television]]; BNT is deemed nonpartisan, but remains vulnerable to political interference from the government.&lt;ref name=FH/&gt; The fourth free-to-air TV network is [[Bulgaria On Air]], owned by Investor.BG (part of the controversial TIM Group of Varna). 

Privately owned television channels started to appear immediately after the regime change. Most were associated with a cable television ([[CATV]]) network run by the same parent company. Around 1994-1995 private over-the-air broadcasters also appeared, but they usually only operated within a single area. [[Nova (Bulgarian TV)|Nova Television]] and [[7 Dni TV]] (''7 дни'', meaning ''7 days'') were two of the first such channels, available only in [[Sofia]]. After [[bTV (Bulgaria)|bTV]] took over [[Efir 2]]'s frequencies, another competition selected [[Nova Television (Bulgaria)|Nova Television]], already popular in cable networks around the country, as the second privately owned national channel in Bulgaria. The authorities currently refuse to license further analogue terrestrial channels (including local ones), until [[DVB-T]] broadcasting is started.

Switch off to Digital terrestrial television ([[DVB-T]]) was completed on 30 September 2013, after a 7-months simulcast period, with 96,2% of the population under DVB-T broadcasting coverage.&lt;ref&gt;http://dnes.dir.bg/news/televizia-tzifrovizatzia-izbori2013-tzifrov-signal-15122672?nt=4&lt;/ref&gt;

===Cinema===
Public funds for the Bulgarian cinema have dried up after the socialist period. Bulgaria has produced three films and two documentaries per year with state subsidies, afforded under tender procedures. Sponsorships also support the Bulgarian film production.&lt;ref name=EJCfilm&gt;Vesela Tabakova, [http://ejc.net/media_landscapes/bulgaria#link_185 Bulgaria #Cinema], ''EJC Media Landscapes'', circa 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

===Telecommunications===
{{Main|Telecommunications in Bulgaria}}
The Bulgarian telecommunication market, now privatised, is shared mainly among three actors: [[A1 Bulgaria]] (owned by [[A1 Austria]] Austria Group), [[Telenor]] (owned by Czech PPF), and [[Vivacom]] (controlled by [[Russia's VTB]]). A1 Bulgaria and Telenor Bulgaria dominate the mobile market, while Vivacom retains dominance on the 2.3 million landlines.&lt;ref name=EJCtlc&gt;Vesela Tabakova, [http://ejc.net/media_landscapes/bulgaria#link_186 Bulgaria #Telecommunications], ''EJC Media Landscapes'', circa 2010&lt;/ref&gt; Mobile phones in 2007 amounted to 9.87 million lines, with 110% penetration rate.

The telephony system features an extensive but antiquated telecommunications network inherited from the Soviet era; quality has improved; the Bulgaria Telecommunications Company's fixed-line monopoly terminated in 2005 when alternative fixed-line operators were given access to its network; a drop in fixed-line connections in recent years has been more than offset by a sharp increase in mobile-cellular telephone use fostered by multiple service providers; the number of cellular telephone subscriptions now exceeds the population.

===Internet===

==Media Organisations==
===Media agencies===
The public media agency in Bulgaria is the [[Bulgarian News Agency]] (BTA), established in 1898 and regulated by a 1994 Statute. it serves all media in the country.
Private web-based news agencies include ''Focus'' (now also a player on the radio market).
&lt;ref name=EJCnews&gt;Vesela Tabakova, [http://ejc.net/media_landscapes/bulgaria#link_193 Bulgaria #News agencies], ''EJC Media Landscapes'', circa 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

===Trade unions===
The [[Union of Publishers in Bulgaria]] (UPB) represents many owners of newspapers, magazines and books, though not all of them.
&lt;ref name=EJCtu&gt;Vesela Tabakova, [http://ejc.net/media_landscapes/bulgaria#link_194 Bulgaria #Trade unions], ''EJC Media Landscapes'', circa 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Association of the Bulgarian Broadcasters]] (ABBRO) represents the interests of the radio and television industry, and includes 60 companies representing 160 licensed radio and TV stations (2007 data).&lt;ref name=EJCtu/&gt;

The [[Union of Bulgarian Journalists]], stemming from its socialist roots, did not manage to establish itself as a professional organisation to protect journalists' interests.&lt;ref name=EJCtu/&gt;

NGOs in the media sector, dealing with media freedom and professionalisation of journalism, include Access to Information Program, Media Development Centre, Centre for Independent Journalism.&lt;ref name=EJCtu/&gt;

===Regulatory authorities===
In lack of any specific law on the printed media, there is not any specific regulatory or supervisory body either.

The Council for Electronic Media (CEM), established by the 1998 Radio and Television Act, checks compliance with regulations about advertising, sponsorship, copyright, protection of youth and minors, and considers violation complaints brought by experts and citizens. 
Five of its members are elected by Parliament, four are named by the President. Its independence from political and corporate pressures remains a matter of debate, and several of its actions have been controversial.&lt;ref name=EJCreg&gt;Vesela Tabakova, [http://ejc.net/media_landscapes/bulgaria#link_200 Bulgaria #Regulatory authority], ''EJC Media Landscapes'', circa 2010&lt;/ref&gt; The CEM is deemed as subject to multiple political and economic pressures.&lt;ref name=FH/&gt;

==Censorship, self-censorship, soft-censorship and media freedom==
Bulgaria scores as "partly free" in [[Freedom House]]'s 2015 report, with a total score of 38.&lt;ref name=FH&gt;[[Freedom House]], [https://freedomhouse.org/report/freedom-press/2015/bulgaria Bulgaria] 2015 report&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Reporters Without Borders]]' World Press Freedom Index, Bulgaria is ranked 106th, with a score of 32.91; in the region, Bulgaria comes after [[Greece]] (91st) and right before [[Montenegro]] (114th) and [[Republic of Macedonia|Macedonia]] (117th). Its score is on a steady downward path since the early 2000s (it was 34th on 158 in 2003).&lt;ref&gt;[[Reporters Without Borders]], [https://index.rsf.org/#!/index-details/BGR World Press Freedom Index] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160419161741/http://index.rsf.org/|date=2016-04-19 }} 2015, Bulgaria&lt;/ref&gt;

According to a 2016 report of the [[World Association of Newspapers and News Publishers]] (WAN IFRA), prepared by the [[South East Europe Media Organisation]] (SEEMO), the independence and pluralism of Bulgaria's media has eroded steadily over the past decade.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=|first=|date=2016|title=Curbing Media, Crippling Debate: Soft Censorship in Bulgaria|url=http://www.wan-ifra.org/sites/default/files/field_article_file/SC%20Bulgaria%20final%202016%20%282%29.pdf|journal=WAN IFRA Soft censorship report series|publisher=World Association of Newspapers and News Publishers (WAN IFRA)|volume=|pages=|access-date=30 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Bulgaria, media freedom and freedom of expression are increasingly constrained despite constitutional guarantees and right to access public information protected by the [[Access to public information in Bulgaria|Law on Access to Public Information]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

According to WAN IFRA, Bulgarian authorities are increasingly employing tools of "[[soft censorship]]" to dominate and influence the country's media and limiting access to information and informed policy debate.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Soft censorship, or indirect censorship, is defined as any official actions aiming at influencing media output, short of legal or extralegal bans, direct censorship, or physical attacks on media outlets and media professionals. These forms of indirect censorship include selective and partisan allocation of funds and advertising, as well as biased application of regulations and allocation of licenses, which can influence editorial content but also affect media outlets' sustainability.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

One of the main tool leading to official soft censorship in Bulgaria is, according to WAN IFRA, biased state funding for media. Allocation of advertising and subsidies are opaque and non transparent. The situation has deteriorated due to the financial crisis which resulted in an increased dependency on government funding and in media content which avoid any criticism against government and official actions.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Many journalists cannot report in an impartial way and many are unwilling to openly speak about soft censorship as they fear of losing their jobs.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; 

Most media which are not controlled by the state, are in the hands of businesses with close ties to the governmental structures. [[Transparency of media ownership in Bulgaria|Transparency of media ownership]] is poor, but media ownership can be connected to a handful of leading political and business interests. Media owners and journalists know that in such a context critical coverage of people in government and public institutions the control or influence the allocation of funds may lead to the denial or withdrawal of such support, thus putting in danger their financial viability. Self-censorship may be necessary for economic survival.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

According to the 2016 WAN IFRA’s report, there are fewer physical attacks on journalists, although different threats are still reported. Much more common is use of libel and defamation lawsuits to intimidate and influence journalists or media outlets that not self-censor. Even though imprisonment for liberal and defamation was abolished in 1999, still they remain criminal offenses under Bulgarian criminal code. Convictions grounded in such cases are few, but the concrete possibility of prosecution entails a chilling effect on active, open and critical reporting.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Pressures and intimidations on journalists are widespread, giving rise to [[self-censorship]]. Police also sometime questions media professionals about their activities. High-level politicians often display intolerance towards media criticism. Impunity for crimes against journalists remains the norm.&lt;ref name=FH/&gt; A June 2013 survey of 150 Bulgarian journalists by the Bulgarian affiliate of the [[Association of European Journalists]] remarked that 80% of them reported the existence of undue pressures and 60% said that internal pressures had distorted editorial contents.&lt;ref name=pace/&gt;

==Concentration of media ownership and media pluralism==
{{See also|Transparency of media ownership in Bulgaria}}
===Overview===
Concentration of media, both in terms of ownership and audience, is very high in Bulgaria.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://monitor.cmpf.eui.eu/results-2014/bulgaria/|title=Media Pluralism Monitor. Bulgaria 2014|last=|first=|date=June 2014|website=Monitor.cmpf.eui.eu|publisher=Centre for Media Pluralism and Media Freedom (CMPF)|access-date=20 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Except for the Public Service Media, no media-specific legislation regulates media ownership concentration and the issue falls within the scope of the general competition law.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.balcanicaucaso.org/eng/Areas/Bulgaria/Media-concentration-and-media-ownership-in-Bulgaria-156381|title=Media concentration and media ownership in Bulgaria|last=Dimitrova|first=Svetla|date=17 October 2014|website=Balcanicaucaso.org|publisher=Osservatorio Balcani Caucaso Transeuropa|access-date=20 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The Law on Radio and Television establishes only a general principle that a media licensing application must comply with the competition protection legislation. However, according to experts, this general provision proves to be inadequate.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; The Constitutional Court recognised media pluralism as an intrinsic part of media freedom, however “the principle of media pluralism is not respected in practice”.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

According to the [[Media Pluralism Monitor]] one of the major problems is the lack of effective legal remedies against media concentrations.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Concern over concentration of media ownership in Bulgaria have also been raised by the [[European Commission]] in the first EU Anti-Corruption report which found out that media ownership in Bulgaria is increasingly concentrated, thus compromising editorial independence.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

In a nutshell, there are two main obstacles for the effective reduction of media concentrations in Bulgaria: non-transparent media ownership and the lack of media-specific legislation regulating media concentration. These obstacles cannot be removed without political will for this.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

===Legal framework===
Unlike a number of European states, in Bulgaria there are not special rules concerning the supervision of mergers and acquisitions in the media sector. This supervision aims at ruling out the possibility that a media business or person has an excessive interest in one or more media sectors.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=|first=|year=2015|title=Media ownership in Bulgaria: state of play and challenges|url=http://www.csd.bg/artShow.php?id=17518|journal=Center for the Study of Democracy|volume=Policy Brief No. 49|pages=|access-date=20 March 2017|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

There are no provisions on media concentration in the Radio and Television Act applying to this media sector. As for print media, the sector is not regulated by law so there are no rules related to competition either. Issues related to concentration of ownership in the sector of digital media have not been discussed yet (2016).&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

Media fall under the regulation of the Commission for the Protection of Competition (CPC) which is in charge of overseeing concentration among undertakings, prohibiting anti-competitive agreements, decisions and practices, as well as abuse of dominant position.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;  The Commission defines market concentration and the exemptions from it. Businesses are obliged by law to report to the Commission in case their income exceeds a certain threshold. In such cases the Commission allows concentration if it does not lead to the establishment or increasing of a dominant position, which would significantly prevent competition in the relevant market.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=|first=|year=2016|title=A comparative analysis of media freedom and pluralism in the EU Member States|url=http://www.europarl.europa.eu/RegData/etudes/STUD/2016/571376/IPOL_STU(2016)571376_EN.pdf|journal=Directorate-General for Internal Policies. Policy Department Citizens' Rights and Constitutional Affairs|chapter=|publisher=European Parliament (EP)|volume=|pages=|access-date=20 March 2017|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In case of failure to report, or of concentration prohibited by the Commission, it may impose sanctions.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; 

In 2010, a new draft law on electronic media was discussed and the Commission for the Protection of Competition issued an opinion assessing the compliance of the proposal with the Protection of Competition Act. The Commission stated that in evaluating the risk of concentration it relies solely on an economic analysis, checking only the market share of the respective media, as well as audience share and advertising market share.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; The Commission does not take into consideration factors like the potential impact of the concentration on media content and the public significance of such impact.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; It thus observed that specific regulatory considerations regarding the media market, such as the need to guarantee pluralism and freedom of expression, are not taken into account by the Commission itself when overseeing concentrations.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; 

The case law of the regulatory authority regarding media concentration in Bulgaria clearly shows that further regulation and supervision are needed in order to guarantee that non-market principles, such as media pluralism, are taken into consideration in assessing transactions falling under competitive law. According to experts, effective measures for ensuring media pluralism should not be limited to self-regulation measures, but include the introduction of a body in charge of conducting non-economic analysis to assess the influence of media outlets.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; However, such measures are not endorsed on political level.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

===Broadcast sector===
In Bulgaria, the only legal explicit restrictions on media ownership is enshrined in the Law on Radio and Television, adopted in 1998 and amended several times since then. The Law was elaborated with the aim of regulating the market of broadcast media.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Media ownership and its impact on media independence and pluralism|last=Petković|first=Brankica|publisher=Peace Institute, Institute for Contemporary Social and Political Studies|year=2004|isbn=961-6455-26-5|location=Ljubljana,|pages=|chapter=Bulgaria}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although the Law was not conceived specifically to address the issue of concentration, it includes restrictions on cross-ownership, pertaining only to national broadcasters.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; According to the law, licenses cannot be awarded to legal persons (or persons related to legal persons) which already possess licenses for local radio or television stations. This amendment was introduced after discovering cases of local operators acquiring licenses for national broadcasting. The Law also stipulates that national operators cannot become owners of local and regional stations. It also requires applicants to declare that they do not hold stakes, shares or other rights of participation in radio and television broadcasters above the threshold set by anti-trust legislation.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

The law regulates the operation of Bulgarian broadcasters and contains some provisions restricting broadcast licenses and regulates the registration of cable programmes.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; Several provisions aim at protecting the media environment from the entry of dubious capital. For instance, the Law establishes that businesses connected with insurance services are ineligible for applying for a broadcast license. This provision is the result of a specific feature of the Bulgarian economy, where certain insurance companies born out of structures related to the previous regime's security services sector.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; However, in practice, due to the weakness of the Bulgarian media market which is unable to sustain the broadcast and print media, the opportunities for the entry of suspicious capitale into the media sphere have recently increased.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; Also, the law excludes from holding a license of a broadcast media telecommunications operators placed in a monopoly situation on the market (i.e. the state telecommunications company Bulgarian Telecommunications Company) and advertising agencies or companies including partners or shareholders having interests in the advertisement market.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

When applying for a license in the broadcasting sector, the applicant is required to submit a declaration showing who the owners are and what their shares are, including document showing the origin of the capital for the last three years. Also, the application should include a list of media enterprises in which the persons are shareholders or partners.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

===Press distribution===
Tendencies towards concentration characterise the area of press distribution as well. Some of the factors contributing to this concern the possibility for a publisher to be a distributor at the same time; the aggregation of ownership in non-transparent way; and political connections and dependencies influencing the sector. A dominant position in this sector impedes the fair distribution of small publishers' works.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; In 2011, the Commission for the Protection of Competition carried out an analysis on the press distribution sector. It found out that in the period from 2009 to 2011 there was a pooling of the distributors on the market aiming at optimising costs exploit the advantages of economies of scale and scope. Such integration impeded the entry of new actors on the market and led to market concentration.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

===The case of the ''New Media Group''===
Media concentration has been widely debated in Bulgaria since the 1990s. After the change from Communism to the market economy, the country faced the issue of concentration: the monopoly positions of the state media were replaced by the domination of several private media groups.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; In the 1990s the problem affected in particular the print sector: two most influential newspapers at that time - ''Trud'' and ''24 hours'' - were purchased by the ''WAZ Group''. The group dominated the Bulgarian media market until the late 2000s.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; In the late 2000s, the creation and rapid grow of the ''New Media Group'' were seen again as a case of media ownership concentration in the sector of print and online media.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; At stakes there was the group’s links with politics and a bank.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; The group purchased local media, thus acquiring a dominant position in the local media market and in print media distribution. According to some estimates, the company gained a 70-80% share in the print media distribution market.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; The case of the ''New Media Group'' lead to public debate in 2001 that forced the Commission on the Protection of Competition to make a sectoral analysis of the concentration in the print media distribution market. The study found that the concentration in 2009-2011 constituted an obstacle to new competitors wishing to enter the market . The Commission also concluded that there was a lack of transparent rules in the field. However, it issued a permission for such concentration on the basis that it would not establish or increase a dominant position in the distribution market.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

===Concentration of media ownership in practice===
According to the [[Media Pluralism Monitor]], "concentration of media ownership is very high".&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The top 4 major owners in the broadcasting sector have an aggregated market share (based on advertising revenue only) of 93.35%. The top 4 major owners of daily newspapers reach an aggregated market share of 79.7%. As for Internet Service Providers (ISPs), they have an estimated market share which is above 50%.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Concentration trends are also present in terms of audience and readership whose concentration is "very high" according to the Media Pluralism Monitor.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; In television, the top 4 major owners have an audience share that is above 70%; as for the radio sector, the aggregated share of the top 4 major owners is 83.16%. The top 4 major newspaper owners have an estimated readership share between 25 to 49%, and the subscription share of the top 4 ISPs is estimated to be above 50%.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

===Political and economic influence on media owners===
In Bulgaria, there are significant links between media owners and other actors operating in the economic landscape.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; According to expert Nelly Ognyanova, there are unregulated links between media, money and power.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; This fact became publicly known following a joint access to information request submitted by 11 biggest newspapers in 2010, which revealed that a media group owning newspapers, internet outlets and a TV station borrowed large amounts of money from a big bank, the ''Corporate Trade Bank''. Also, the information disclosed showed that the same bank hosted a considerable amount of budget money of several ministers as well as bank accounts of relevant state-owned companies operating in the field of energy, public transport, defence and information service.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; The owner of such media group, Delyan Peevsky, also runs businesses in other sectors, such as construction, tobacco and newspapers distribution. Moreover, his businesses are allegedly involved in big public procurements.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; The group is also connected with the political party, the ''Movement for Rights and Freedoms'' (DPS) which has been influential for many years.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; Mr. Peevsky is the son of Irena Krasteva, the owner of many of the print media outlets within the ''New Media Group''. Bulgarian press revealed the existence of connections between the ''New Media Group'' and political parties and other businesses.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; This is not the only case of political influence over the media in Bulgaria. For instance, there are some media which are officially owned by political figures or parties, a case that is not prohibited by law in Bulgaria.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

==State Funding==
{{Expand section|date=November 2017}}
The communication campaigns on EU funds turned out to be one of the funding sources for the Bulgarian media. The budget on advertising for the period 2007-2014 was 84.3 mln. EUR (165 mln. BGN). A detailed distribution of the funds between outlets isn't available as the contracts between ministries and media were conducted by advertising agencies and other intermediaries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Curbing Media, Crippling Debate|url=http://www.seemo.org/assets/pdf/soft-censorship-bulgaria.pdf|publisher=WAN-IFRA World Association of Newspapers and News Publishers|accessdate=27 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''MI6-HQ.com''' is a media-website dedicated to the people, places and world of [[James Bond]], providing daily updates on the subject.

== About ==
MI6-HQ.com (formerly '''MI6.co.uk''', which subsequently redirects to CommanderBond.net) publishes original, in-depth articles and intercepts a comprehensive collection of news headlines involving all aspects of the world of James Bond, including news on the actors (past, present and future), the production team, film news and commercial product tie-ins. As well as news from the Bond films, MI6-HQ.com is host to a series of portals for both literary and filmic coverage of an encyclopaedic nature. The website is probably best known for its range of exclusive interviews with influential members of the James Bond world, including [[Charlie Higson]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.MI6-HQ.com/sections/articles/interview_charlie_higson_yb1f_bookfive.php3 MI6 – The Home of James Bond – In Conversation With Charlie Higson]&lt;/ref&gt; (''[[Young Bond]]'' writer), [[David Hedison]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.MI6-HQ.com/sections/articles/interview_david_hedison.php3 MI6 – The Home of James Bond – David Hedison Interview]&lt;/ref&gt; (two time Felix Leiter actor), [[Jeffery Deaver]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Jeffery Deaver Exclusive Interview|url=http://www.mi6-hq.com/sections/articles/interview_jeffery_deaver1.php3|publisher=MI6-HQ.com|accessdate=31 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; (author of ''[[Carte Blanche (novel)|Carte Blanche]]'', a Bond [[continuation novel]]) and [[Christopher Wood (writer)|Christopher Wood]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.MI6-HQ.com/sections/articles/interview_christopher_wood.php3 MI6 – The Home of James Bond – Christopher Wood Interview]&lt;/ref&gt; screenwriter for ''[[The Spy Who Loved Me (film)|The Spy Who Loved Me]]''.

==Events==
In 2005 MI6, together with [[Cinema Retro]] and BondStars.com, put together a screening of the Bond film ''[[Thunderball (film)|Thunderball]]'' to celebrate the film's 40th anniversary.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.MI6-HQ.com/sections/articles/events_thunderball_40th_report.php3 | title = Thunderball 40th Anniversary Event Report}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dave Worrall, Lee Pfeiffer (Journalists and Cinema Retro publishers), Gareth Owen (author) and the founders of MI6 hosted the event.

As well as the screening of the 1965 film, the event hosted a book signing with Sir Christopher Frayling and question and answer sessions with [[Ken Adam]], [[Molly Peters]], [[George Leech (actor)|George Leech]], [[Martine Beswick]], [[Earl Cameron (actor)|Earl Cameron]] and [[Norman Wanstall]].

In 2010, MI6 published an exclusive copy of the "lost" ''[[Per Fine Ounce]]'' extract by acclaimed South African novelist [[Geoffrey Jenkins]]. It was released by the Jenkins estate and gives fans a glimpse into what might have been had [[Ian Fleming Publications|Glidrose]] accepted the manuscript.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mi6-hq.com/sections/articles/literary_per_fine_ounce_extract.php3 MI6 – The Home of James Bond – Per Fine Ounce – Exclusive Extract]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Mperience''' is a [[social media]] platform about [[film|cinema]], [[literature]] and [[art]] ([[painting]], [[sculpture]], [[photography]], and [[architecture]]). It was launched in April 2010 and is currently in [[Software testing|public alpha]].

== Description ==
''Mperience'' provides to the public a [[database]] of about 54000 movies, 28000 books and 18000 artists on which is built a semantic [[recommender system]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Wired (magazine)|Wired]] Italy, July 2010&lt;/ref&gt; Each [[movie]], [[book]] and [[artist]] is accessible via a [[web page]], presenting basic information and recommendations for related videos and related items. [[End-user|Users]] can browse these pages through themes and emotions (e.g., “myths and philosophy” or “journey of rediscovery”) that connect different items.
The [[Website|site]] allows users to share opinions about cinema, literature and art by mingling text with videos and images. The resulting pages are named ''Memes'' on the site, supposedly with reference to [[Richard Dawkins]]’ concept of [[meme]].

== Technology ==
''Mperience'' [[recommender system]] is based on both [[natural language processing]] and [[machine learning]] [[algorithm]]s. Algorithms include variations of [[restricted Boltzmann machine]], [[singular value decomposition]], [[K-nearest neighbor algorithm|''k''-nearest neighbors]], and [[Bayesian network]]s.
[[Semantic search|Semantic]] algorithms allow the extraction of relevant passages (“themes &amp; emotions”) &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=Terminology extraction from unstructured texts, collaboration with the Department of Informatics at La Sapienza University |url=http://w3.uniroma1.it/dipinfo/dbinfo/verbali/cdd290110.pdf|accessdate=2010-06-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; from the descriptions of items and the [[computation]] of [[Semantic similarity|similarity]] between these texts.

''Mperience'' credits [[Wikipedia]] and [[Freebase (database)|Freebase]] as its primary sources of [[Ontology (information science)|ontological information]] about movies, books, and artists.

== History ==
''Mperience'' was founded in December 2009 and raised $230.000 in [[seed funding]] from [[private investors]]. In January 2010, the company was one of the finalists at the Start-up Initiative, the [[Start-up company|start-up]] competition organized by [[Intesa Sanpaolo|Intesa-San Paolo]] [[Bank|banking group]],&lt;ref&gt;Il Mondo, 12 February 2010&lt;/ref&gt; and in March 2010 was invited at SMAU computer [[Exhibition|expo]] for the exhibition "Percorsi dell'Innovazione" (Innovation Paths).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=MPerience at SMAU, Percorsi dell'Innovazione |url= http://roma.smau.it/article/articleview/1942/ |accessdate=2010-06-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1350">In [[game theory]], a '''null move''' or '''pass''' is a decision by a player to not make a move when it is that player's turn to move. Even though null moves are against the rules of many games, they are often useful to consider when analyzing these games. Examples of this include the analysis of [[zugzwang]] (a situation in chess or other games in which a null move, if it were allowed, would be better than any other move),&lt;ref&gt;{{citation

'''Panther Games Pty Ltd''' ('''Panther Games''') is an [[Australia]]n [[video game developer|games developer]], best known for the WWII [[Airborne Assault]] and [[Command Ops]] PC video game series. Panther Games specialises in developing operational level [[Wargaming|wargames]] for the [[Wargame (video games)|PC Wargame]] market.

==History==

Panther Games was founded in 1985&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.mobygames.com/company/panther-games-pty-ltd | title = Moby Games: Panther Games Pty Ltd profile | publisher=[[MobyGames]] | accessdate = 2013-01-10 }}&lt;/ref&gt; by David O’Connor in [[Canberra]], [[Australia]].

In the early years Panther Games initially focused on developing and producing [[board games]] and released three titles in the mid 80’s, ''[[Trial of Strength]]'', ''[[Shanghai Trader]]'' and ''[[Warlords: China in Disarray, 1916 – 1950|Warlords]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/8208/trial-of-strength | title = Board Game Geek: Trial of Strength | publisher=[[BoardGameGeek]] | accessdate = 2013-01-10 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/796/shanghai-trader | title = Board Game Geek: Shanghai Trader | publisher=[[BoardGameGeek]] | accessdate = 2013-01-10 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/7267/warlords-china-in-disarray-1916-1950 | title = Board Game Geek: Warlords China in Disarray 1916-1950 | publisher=[[BoardGameGeek]] | accessdate = 2013-01-10 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, the company shifted their focus to developing [[computer games]] in the late 1980s with the release of their first computer wargame, ''[[Fire-Brigade: The Battle for Kiev - 1943|Fire Brigade]]'', in 1988 on [[Macintosh|Mac]], [[DOS]], [[Atari]] and [[Amiga]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.mobygames.com/game/fire-brigade-the-battle-for-kiev-1943 | title = Moby Games: Fire Brigade the battle for Kiev 1943 | publisher=[[MobyGames]] | accessdate = 2013-01-10 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Fire Brigade currently forms part of the historical collection of software; hardwere; trade and promotional materials that document the history of [[Apple Inc.]] and its contributions to the computer industry and society.

Following the success of Fire Brigade, Panther Games took a step into the mainstream games market with the releases of [[sci-fi]] adventure ''[[Alien Drug Lords]]'' and puzzle challenge game [[Cubit game|''Cubit'']] in 1991.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://hol.abime.net/3241 | title = Hall of Light - The database of Amiga Games: Alien Drug Lords: The Chyropian Connection | accessdate = 2013-01-10 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://hol.abime.net/3141 | title = Hall of Light - The database of Amiga Games: Cubit | accessdate = 2013-01-10 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1996 Panther Games decided to return to its [[Wargame (video games)|wargame]] roots and instigated development of a new [[Real-time strategy|real-time computer game engine]] for a novel operational wargame series to be called Airborne Assault (AA).The use of a real-time engine without a hexagon grid for a wargame was novel as traditional computer wargames run on a turn-based system where there are dedicated phases for planning, movement and engagement. The AA engine (later rebranded Command Ops) allowed for planning, movement and engagement to be played in continues time and the hexagon grid was no longer needed to determine movement capabilities of units.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.wargamer.com/article/3161/Command-Ops:-Highway-to-the-Reich | title = THE GAME &amp; THE THREE T’s: TRAVEL, TIME AND TRICKLE-DOWN | date=5 March 2012 | accessdate = 2013-01-11 | publisher=[[The Wargamer (website)|The Wargamer]] |first=John |last=Thompson }}&lt;/ref&gt; Panther Games' AA game engine and the associated [[AI]] capabilities has notably been referenced in publications by Peter Perla at [[Center for Naval Analyses]] (CNA), Michael Peck at Defence News and the Digital Humanities at [[King's College London]].&lt;ref&gt;Perla, Peter P. &amp; Markowitz, Michael C.

The first title to be produced in the series was ''[[Airborne Assault: Red Devils over Arnhem]]'' (RDOA) and was released in 2002 through wargame publisher [[battlefront.com]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://au.gamespot.com/airborne-assault-red-devils-over-arnhem/ | title = Gamespot AU: Airborne Assault Red Devils over Arnhem | publisher=[[GameSpot]] | accessdate = 2013-01-11 }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, in Europe, Panther Games used a different publisher, [[CDV Software Entertainment AG]], and the title for the game was simply Airborne Assault.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.mobygames.com/game/windows/airborne-assault-red-devils-over-arnhem/cover-art/gameCoverId,34681/ | title = Moby Games: CDV cover art for Airborne Assault | publisher=[[MobyGames]] | accessdate = 2013-01-11 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The second and third instalments of the AA series were released through a new publisher, [[Matrix Games]], with ''[[Airborne Assault: Highway to the Reich]]'' (HTTR) coming out in 2003 and ''[[Airborne Assault: Conquest of the Aegean]]'' (COTA) in 2006.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.allgame.com/game.php?id=42980&amp;tab=sysreqs | title = Allgame: Airborne Assault Highway to the Reich | publisher=[[Allgame]] | accessdate = 2013-01-11 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.matrixgames.com/products/313/details/Conquest.of.the.Aegean | title = Matrix Games: Airborne Assault Conquest of the Aegean | publisher=[[Matrix Games]] | accessdate = 2013-01-11 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2010, Panther Games rebranded their long running games series to Command Ops and released their latest title, ''[[Command Ops: Battles from the Bulge]]'' (BFTB).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.pcworld.com/article/197693/battles_from_the_bulge.html | title = Why PC Wargame Battles From The Bulge Costs So Much | date=1 June 2010 | accessdate = 2013-01-11 | publisher=[[PC World]] |first=Matt |last=Peckham }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2012, the first official [[expansion pack]] Panther Games has ever released came out titled, ''Command Ops: Highway to the Reich''. This is an expansion pack for BFTB and covers content from the original two AA games.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.matrixgames.com/products/421/details/Command.Ops:.Highway.to.the.Reich | title = Matrix Games: Command Ops Highway to the Reich | publisher=[[Matrix Games]] | accessdate = 2013-01-11 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

18 October 2014, Panther Games in conjunction with [[Lock 'n Load (tabletop game)|Lock 'n Load publishing]] jointly announce Panther Games' move to Lock 'n Load publishing following the split between Panther games and Matrix Games. Following the announcement it was revealed Panther Games through Lock n' Load would be re-releasing Panther Games' successful 1985 board game [[Trial of Strength]] with a new edition. it would be the first time the board game has been re-released since its initial release in 1985. In addition, it was revealed Panther Games' new game engine, Command Ops 2, would be released through the publisher along with all subsequent data packs for the engine. This represented a new method of content delivery for the company.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://forums.lnlpublishing.com/threads/welcome-panther-games.867/ | title = Welcome Panther Games | publisher=[[Lock 'n Load (tabletop game)|Lock 'n Load]] | first= | last= | date=2014-10-18 | accessdate = 2015-07-31 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://grogheads.com/?p=6388 | title = Breaking News: Panther Games signs with LNLP | publisher=Grogheads | first= | last= | date=2014-10-20 | accessdate = 2015-07-31 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

June 2015, Command Ops 2 goes public beta and the "Commander Pack" consisting of all five modual data packs for Command Ops 2 goes on sale 16 June 2015.

===Professional services to the military===

Parallel to its commercial wargame development, Panther Games also provides [[professional services]] to the military. Simulation Australia (part of the Australian Department of innovation, Industry, Science and Research) describe Panther Games' [[professional services]] capabilities to include wargame design and development; [[artificial intelligence]]; user interface; [[Computer programming|programming]]; scenario development (including for [[JSAF]]); Puckstering (for [[JSAF]]) and a wide range of Analysis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://directory.simulationaustralia.org.au/company/panther-games-pty-ltd/ | title = Panther Games | year=2012 | publisher=simulationaustralia.org.au | accessdate = 2013-01-14 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2007, Panther Games was a team partner along with [[Booz Allen Hamilton]], Ball Solutions, [[Centre for Adult Education|CAE]] and Calytrix Technology in the successful Joint Decision Support and Simulations Centre (JDSSC) project for the [[Australian Department of Defence]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.calytrix.com/news/newsitem/94/ | title = Calytrix Teams on JDSSC | date=22 March 2007 | publisher= Calytrix Technologies | accessdate = 2013-01-11 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2009, Panther Games became an associate member of the joint Defence-Industry initiative, Rapid Prototyping, Development and Evaluation Program (RPDE).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.rpde.org.au/participants | title = RPDE Participants | publisher=RPDE | accessdate = 2013-01-14 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In October 2010, Panther Games began a four-month scoping study for the Australian Defence Simulation Office (ADSO) to determine the Defence requirements for a course of action analyser simulation tool.

'''Polka dot paint''' is a [[paint]] which produces a [[polka dot]] pattern. 

The paint is traditionally an impossible object, and the subject of a [[fool's errand]] prank played upon [[apprentice]]s in the decoration or construction trade, who are sent to obtain a bucket of polka-dot paint.&lt;ref&gt;''The Painter and Decorator'', Volume 73, 1959, [https://books.google.com/books?id=sO-fAAAAMAAJ&amp;focus=searchwithinvolume&amp;q=%22polka+dot%22 p. 4]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt; Peter J. H. Petter-Bowyer, "Winds of Destruction: The Autobiography of a Rhodesian Combat Pilot",  [https://books.google.com/books?id=akwPLOZMZYIC&amp;pg=PA72 p. 72]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Richard Gordon Charman, ''The Learning Curve: My Story'', 2011,
 {{ISBN|0987060007}}, [https://books.google.com/books?id=3kcZlq_1kZsC&amp;pg=PA78 p. 78]
*''Quote:'' "Like all tradesmen, in all companies, the new apprentices were sent by them to the local hardware store &lt;...&gt; to get 'a left-handed hammer', 'a right-handed scredwriver', 'a box of r/h threaded holes', 'a tin of blue and yellow striped paint', 'a tin of black and white polka dot paint' &lt;...&gt; "&lt;/ref&gt; A polka-dot paint effect has been produced in [[stage magic]], and in the 1950s a polychromatic paint was invented which produced a dotted effect when dry.

==Magic tricks==
In the United States several [[magician (illusionist)|magician]]s invented a trick in which they demonstrating painting with polka-dot paint. Prior to the performance, an object is pre-painted in the desired pattern with an [[oil-based paint]] and then covered with white [[watercolor]] or [[whitewash]]. During the trick, a wet brush passed over the object removes the layer of watercolor, revealing the polka dots.

The truck was the subject of litigation between two [[stage magicians]], Harry Albacker and Paul Stadelman in 1950s. The defendant's defense was that the magic act was "old as hills", and hence in [[public domain]]. &lt;ref&gt;[https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1129&amp;dat=19491101&amp;id=EdcNAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=QWoDAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=2454,31794&amp;hl=en "Another Claims Spotted Pigment Invention As Local Magician Says In's 2 Other Tricks"], ''Pittsburgh Post-Gazette, November 1, 1949,
 page 3.&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt;"General News: Magic", by Bill Sachs, ''[[The Billboard]]'', January 14, 1950 [https://books.google.com/books?id=9vUDAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PT44 p. 47]&lt;/ref&gt; Stadelman, in his turn was challenged by other magicians who claimed that he took the idea from the "[[barber's pole]] paint" trick. However Stadelman claimed it was actually he who invented the barber's pole paint trick in the first place.&lt;ref name=b1950&gt;"Magician Finds Public Ready For New Paint",
 ''The Bulletin'', March 3, 1950, [https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1243&amp;dat=19500303&amp;id=-2hYAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=cvcDAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=6303,5615908&amp;hl=en p. 9]&lt;/ref&gt; Stadelman said that often after he performed this trick as paint dealers' conventions, he was getting letters from people who wanted to market this paint.&lt;ref name=b1950/&gt;

Another version of this trick involves colorless chemicals on the object which become colored after a reaction with another chemical on the brush.

==Real paint==
In 1950 a product called "Plextone" by Maas &amp; Walsdtein Co. was advertised,  a finishing which is a single application produced  "a network of interlaced but separate colors - a 'Polka Dot' paint".&lt;ref&gt;''Product Finishing'', vol 15, 1950, p. 110 ([https://books.google.com/books?id=y9o3AAAAMAAJ&amp;focus=searchwithinvolume&amp;q=Polka+dot google snippet])&lt;/ref&gt; In 1952 a John C. Zola patented (US 3811904 &lt;ref&gt;[https://www.google.com/patents/US3811904 "Novel coating compositions and their preparation -  US 3811904 A".]

At least some of the dispersed globules are different in color from the dispersin'g medium" &lt;/ref&gt;) polychromatic paint, technically described as "a multicolor paint from lacquer-based colorants suspended in water". The inventor was inspired by French painter [[Georges Seurat]], who created his [[impressionism|impressionist]] effects using small dots of paint. &lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=6zQEAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA50 "Dotting the Eyes"], ''The Rotarian'', July 1975, p. 50&lt;/ref&gt; Sapolin Paints, Inc. of New York City  sold "polka-dot paint" in a [[spray can]], which sprayed droplets of paint; the farther the can was from the surface the larger were the dots. &lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=5t0DAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA207 "On the Market for Do-It-Yourselfers"], ''[[Popular Mechanics]],'' March 1958, p. 207&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Retention of vision''' is a [[conjuring]] term referring to the [[visual perception|perceived image]] of an object during a vanish (usually associated with vanishing coins).{{Citation needed|date=November 2007}} In a [[retention of vision vanish]], the spectator sees a coin placed on a palm and as the fingers are closed around the coin it is secretly removed, but because the retina still retains a fleeting image of the coin for a fraction of a second, the spectator will be convinced that the coin was placed in the hand, when in fact it wasn't.

"Sexy Bitch" was written by Giorgio Tuinfort, [[Akon|Aliaune Thiam]], [[David Guetta]], Jean-Claude Sindres and [[Sandy Vee]]. The production was helmed by Guetta, Sindres and Vee. Guetta, in an interview for [[MTV News]], said the collaboration with Akon came after they met during a performance of "[[When Love Takes Over]]" with [[Kelly Rowland]]. Akon approached him, asking if they could work together, and Guetta suggested that they should start immediately, so they rented a studio in London and made the song in one night.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Guetta Talks 'Sexy Chick' |url=http://923now.cbslocal.com/2010/01/26/guetta-talks-sexy-chick/ |archive-url=https://archive.is/20120701141507/http://923now.cbslocal.com/2010/01/26/guetta-talks-sexy-chick/ |dead-url=yes |archive-date=July 1, 2012 |work=New York's 92.3 NOW |publisher=CBS Local Media |accessdate=31 May 2012 |date=January 26, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; "Sexy Bitch" was released as the second single from ''[[One Love (David Guetta album)|One Love]]'' (2009), after the international success of "When Love Takes Over".

==Composition==
"Sexy Bitch" runs for 3 minutes and 14 seconds. It features a driving, [[8-bit (music)|8-bit]] style beat.&lt;ref name=Menachem/&gt; According to the digital music sheet published at Musicnotes.com by [[Faber Music]], the song is written in a [[Key note|key]] of [[B minor]].&lt;ref name="sheet music"/&gt; It is set in common time with a fast tempo of 130 beats per minute.&lt;ref name="sheet music"/&gt; Akon's vocals range from a high note of [[B (musical note)|B]]&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; to a low note of [[G (musical note)|G]]&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;.&lt;ref name="sheet music"/&gt; The song has a basic accompaniment pattern consisting of [[open fifth]]s instead of chords, in a pattern of B&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;-D&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;-G&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;-D&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;-E&lt;sub&gt;5.&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;ref name="sheet music"&gt;{{cite web|title=David Guetta - Sexy Bitch Sheet Music (Digital Download)|url=http://www.musicnotes.com/sheetmusic/mtdFPE.asp?ppn=MN0082531&amp;|publisher=Musicnotes.com|accessdate=29 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The lyrics deal with the protagonist's infatuation with a female, demonstrated in lines like  "I'm trying to find the words to describe this girl without being disrespectful," and "nothing like the neighbourhood whore".&lt;ref name=Levine/&gt; Eric Lyndal Martin of ''[[PopMatters]]'' commented that the song's lines would serve best in "Take Back the Night" ballads than on electronica songs.&lt;ref name=Martin/&gt;

"Sexy Bitch" replicated the chart success of the previous single in international territories. In the Australasian countries, it reached the summit of the singles charts in Australia and New Zealand.

==Music video==
[[File:Sexy bitch david guetta and akon.jpg||left|202px|thumb|Akon wakes up to find a message made of lipstick that says "find me at the pool party" and a photo.]]
The video was directed by Stephen Schuster. The video starts with a plane coming and girls in bikinis are seen tanning and swimming. The camera switches to [[Akon]] who wakes up and finds pictures of his date from David Guetta's pool party. He then finds lipstick note on his mirror that reads "find me at pool party" with yet another photo. As the party starts, people enter; a group of teenage boys are not allowed but they employ various methods to get in. The camera switches to Akon again, who is shown singing underwater. The camera flicks to Guetta arriving meeting up with Akon, who then grabs Guetta and they throw each other in the pool. The party continues as Akon pushes more people in, girls dance and Akon with Guetta are shown to be having a water fight. The scene then skips to a club that is called "Fuck Me, I'm Famous" where [[David Guetta]] is performing a concert with [[Tocadisco]], and Akon is walking in from the back, where he meets some girls. Akon then arrives and performs "Sexy Bitch" at the concert. A light up man in blue and green appears. Girls are shown dancing and Akon does a crowd surf before the video ends. At the end, Akon is seen sleeping in the bed waking up finding pictures but goes back to sleep.

The video was filmed in [[Ibiza]], [[Barcelona]], Spain, and [[Swindon]], England around 27 July 2009.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://buzzworthy.mtv.com/2009/09/23/new-ish-video-david-guetta-featuring-akon-sexy-chick/ |title=New(-ish) Video: David Guetta Featuring Akon, ‘Sexy Chick’ » MTV Buzzworthy Blog |publisher=MTV |date=2009-09-23 |accessdate=2010-08-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An alternate version for a censored version of the song ("Sexy Chick") depicts two girls in Akon's bedroom; one is taking Polaroid photos of the other. They even take photos of themselves in Akon's bed while he sleeps. Akon's bed is covered in photos, and as the girls leave, the one most heavily photographed writes in lipstick on the bathroom mirror, "find me at pool party". She attaches another photo and leaves a lipstick impression of her lips on the mirror before she goes to the pool party. Akon then wakes up. The rest of the video is much like the other version, with a few scenes cut or added at the pool party and the club. For example, the underwater singing scene is omitted.

===Controversy===
On 24 March 2010, Buddhist groups in [[Sri Lanka]] have stated the music video was offensive to [[Buddhism]], due to the fact that the Buddha statue is found in several shots in the background throughout. With protests held along with demanding a concert cancellation, the Sri Lankan Government prohibited Akon from entering Sri Lanka with a visa.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://adaderana.lk/news.php?nid=7584|title=No Visa to Akon|publisher=Ada Derana News|date=March 23, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; In response, Akon said "I was not aware that the statue was even on the set of the video until now. I would never set out to offend or desecrate anyone’s religion or religious beliefs... I myself am a spiritual man, so I can understand why they are offended, but violence is never the answer and I am disheartened."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vibe.com/2010/03/akon-responds-sexy-bitch-protests/|title=Akon Responds To ‘Sexy Bitch’ Protests|work=Vibe|date=March 24, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:John Logie Baird and Stooky Bill.png|thumb|upright=1.6|Baird in 1925 with his televisor scanner and dummies "James" and "Stooky Bill" ''(right)''. The banks of bright lights were needed to produce a bright enough image at the receiver.]]
[[Image:Stooky-Bill.JPG|right|thumb|Modern replica of Stooky Bill.]]
&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[Image:Stooky.JPG|right|thumb|Stooky Bill as it would have appeared on Baird's equipment, reproduced using modern [[televisor]] equipment.]] --&gt;

'''Stooky Bill''' was the name given to the head of a [[ventriloquist]] dummy that Scottish television pioneer [[John Logie Baird]] used in his 1924 experiments to transmit a [[television|televised]] image between rooms in his laboratory at 22 Frith Street, London.

Baird invented some of the first experimental [[television]] systems.  In 1924 he developed a [[mechanical television]] system to transmit moving images by means of electrical signals, which he demonstrated on 25 March 1925 at a London department store, Selfridges.   It consisted of a spinning disk set with a spiral pattern of 30 lenses.  As each lens rotated past the illuminated subject, it focused the light from a spot on the subject on a selenium [[photoelectric cell]].  This converted the brightness of the image at each spot into a proportional electric signal, which could be sent to a receiver by radio waves.  As each lens swept past the subject, it scanned a successive line of the image.  At the receiver, a light shining through the holes in a similar rotating disk recreated an image of the subject.

Due to the low sensitivity of the photoelectric cells, Baird's first system was not able to televise human faces, because they had inadequate contrast.  So Baird used a ventriloquist's dummy, whose brightly painted face had greater contrast, and made it move and talk before the scanner.  Stooky Bill and another Baird dummy, "James" have been jokingly called "the first television actors".

"Stooky" or "stookie" is [[Scots (language)|Scots]] for [[stucco]] or [[plaster of Paris]], or for a [[Orthopedic cast|plaster cast]] used to immobilise bone fractures.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Robinson|first=Mairi|title=The Concise Scots Dictionary|year=1987|publisher=Aberdeen University Press|isbn=0-08-028492-2|pages=673–4}}&lt;/ref&gt; The term  is also used someone who is slow-witted or awkward in his movements. The [[incandescent light bulb|incandescent lights]] illuminating the subject to be televised generated so much heat that Baird couldn't use a human for the testing, so Stooky Bill was used.   Eventually the hair became singed and the painted face became cracked by the heat.

The '''Georgian National Ballet''' ({{lang-ka|ქართული ეროვნული ბალეტი|tr}}) was the first professional state dance company in [[Georgia (country)|Georgia]]. Founded by [[Iliko Sukhishvili]] and [[Nino Ramishvili]] in 1945, it was initially named as the '''Georgian State Dance Company'''. Thanks to this company the Georgian national dancing and music has become known in many parts of the world. 

Throughout its history the Georgian National Ballet has appeared at the [[Albert Hall]], The Coliseum, [[The Metropolitan Opera]] and [[Madison Square Garden]], among others. In 1967, [[La Scala]] welcomed them - reportedly the first and the only time a folklore group was given a chance to perform on its stage.

The costumes are designed by [[Simon Virsaladze|Simon (Soliko) Virsaladze]] (1908-1989). Currently, the founders' son Tengiz Sukhishvili is the Artistic Director and General manager of The Georgian National Ballet. His spouse Ms. Inga Tevzadze is also a former dancer, now a ballet master. Iliko Sukhishvili Jr. is a chief choreographer of the Georgian National Ballet today. Nino Sukhishvili is a deputy-manager and costume designer.

The Georgian National Ballet has seventy dancers and a small orchestra.

A performance by the Georgian National Ballet's dancers in which the female dancers, wearing long skirts, appeared to glide across the floor was an inspiration for writer [[Terry Nation]] in creating the [[Dalek]]s for the television series ''[[Doctor Who]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Doctor Who — The Legend: 40 Years of Time Travel |last=Richards |first=Justin |authorlink=Justin Richards |year=2003 |publisher=[[BBC Books]] |location=London |isbn=0-563-48602-3 |page=26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Upon having stored away 100 sovereigns, a man working for the banker suggests that Anargyros starts [[Coin counterfeiting|minting counterfeit sovereigns]], but he adamantly refuses. The banker employee then introduces Anargyros to a divorced attractive lady, Fifi ([[Ilya Livykou]]) that he knows. Anargyros' resistance is soon curbed by Fifi's sexual means, and he spends all his invested 100 sovereigns to buy minting equipment. After much toil the trio produce their first counterfeit coin but Anargyros finds it difficult to deceive people into accepting it a currency because they easily understand it is not a genuine coin. When the sinister employee is arrested, Anargyros fears that the police has discovered their crime and panicked he gets rid of all the counterfeiting equipment and he also abandons Fifi. It is eventually revealed that it was a misunderstanding and the employee was arrested for other reasons.

* '''1967'''
**30 September – Radio 1 launches at 7{{nbsp}}am with [[Tony Blackburn]]'s ''Daily Disc Delivery'' show. He welcomes listeners to "the exciting new sound of Radio 1" and then plays the station's first track: [[The Move]]'s "[[Flowers in the Rain]]".
**1 October – The first [[List of Peel sessions|Peel Session]] takes place, featuring psychedelic rock band [[Tomorrow (band)|Tomorrow]]. 

* '''1968'''
**January – Tony Blackburn stops presenting the breakfast show on Saturdays. Rather than replace Tony, Radio 1 simulcasts the entirety of Radio 2's breakfast show. 

*'''1969'''
**April – [[Johnnie Walker (DJ)|Johnnie Walker]] begins his first stint at Radio 1. He would have three stints at the station, the final one ending in 1995.
**5 October – [[Annie Nightingale]] makes her debut and becomes the station's first female presenter.
**[[Dave Lee Travis]] joins.

==1970s==
*'''1970'''
** July – [[Kenny Everett]] is sacked after making cheeky remarks about the [[Secretary of State for Transport|Transport Minister]]'s wife following a news item.
**[[Bob Harris (radio)|Bob Harris]] joins, staying until 1975 before returning for four years in 1989.

*'''1971'''
**Radio 1 launches its first promotion badges using the slogan "Go Radio 1 Better on 247".
**Radio 1 airs its first documentary, ''The Elvis Presley Story,'' narrated by Wink Martindale.

*'''1972'''
**April – [[Terry Wogan]] leaves to take over ''[[The Radio 2 Breakfast Show]]''.

* '''1973'''
**8 April – [[Kenny Everett]] briefly returns before moving to [[Capital London|Capital Radio]] later in the year.
**1 June – [[Tony Blackburn]] presents his final ''[[The Radio 1 Breakfast Show|Breakfast Show]]'', having fronted the show since the station went on air in 1967. 
**4 June – [[Noel Edmonds]] takes over as presenter three days later with Tony moving to the mid-morning slot, taking over from [[Jimmy Young (broadcaster)|Jimmy Young]] who moves to Radio 2. One of the new features of Tony's show is ''[[The Golden Hour (radio feature)|The Golden Hour]],'' an hour of records that charted in the same year.
**23 July – The first [[Radio 1 Roadshow]] takes place, broadcast from [[Newquay]], Cornwall and hosted by [[Alan Freeman]].
**10 September – ''[[Newsbeat]]'' bulletins air for the first time. [[Richard Skinner (broadcaster)|Richard Skinner]] joins the station as one of the new programme's presenters.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.radiorewind.co.uk/radio1/richard_skinner_page.htm|title=Radio Rewind – BBC Radio 1 People – Richard Skinner|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

*'''1974'''
**Radio 1 hosts its first "Fun Day".
**[[Stuart Henry (DJ)|Stuart Henry]] leaves.

*'''1975'''
**6 January – Broadcasting hours are reduced due to budget cuts at the BBC. All evening programming stops on Radio 1 and the station simulcasts Radio 2 every evening from 7pm. Also the weekday afternoon programme, presented by [[David Hamilton (broadcaster)|David Hamilton]], is broadcast on both stations and [[John Peel]]'s show is moved to the drivetime slot.
**11 January – [[Alan Freeman]] broadcasts [[Live at the Empire Pool|a live performance]] by [[Pink Floyd]] which featured a performance of ''[[The Dark Side of the Moon]]'' in its entirety. The performance was recorded at [[Wembley Arena|the Empire Pool]] on 16 November 1974.
**September – The first edition of ''The Sunday Request Show'' is broadcast, hosted by [[Annie Nightingale]]. The show runs until 1979 before being re-introduced in 1982, running until the spring of 1994.
**27 September – [[Paul Gambaccini]], who joined the station the previous year, presents his first American chart countdown programme.
**29 September – [[John Peel]]'s show moves back to late evenings. For this, Radio 1 'borrows' Radio 2's VHF/FM frequencies on weeknights again (having previously done so from October 1971 to December 1974, for shows hosted by Peel, Annie Nightingale and Bob Harris among others). This one hour on weeknights is the only time of the evening that Radio 1 broadcasts its own programmes, and Radio 1 now ends weekday transmissions an hour earlier, at 6pm.

*'''1976'''
**May – [[Simon Bates]] gets his first regular show.
**September – [[Emperor Rosko]] leaves to return to America.
**December – The first ''[[Festive Fifty]]'' is revealed by [[John Peel]].
**[[David Jensen]] joins.

*'''1977'''
**4 April – Radio 1 extends its weeknight broadcasting hours. The station's daytime weekday programmes are extended by an hour to 7pm and the [[John Peel]] show is also extended by an hour, to two hours.

**28 November – From today, Radio 1 has its own all-day weekday schedule with the launch of a new afternoon programme presented by [[Tony Blackburn]]; [[David Hamilton (broadcaster)|David Hamilton]]'s show, simulcast on both stations since January 1975, moves to Radio 2 only. Tony is replaced on mid-mornings by [[Simon Bates]]. Consequently Radio 1 now has its own all-day schedule on weekdays. However the station continues to simulcast Radio 2 each night from 7pm, apart from the weekday late night John Peel programme.
**[[Peter Powell (DJ)|Peter Powell]] joins.

*'''1978'''
**2 May – [[Dave Lee Travis]] succeeds [[Noel Edmonds]] as presenter of the ''[[The Radio 1 Breakfast Show|Breakfast Show]]'' and [[David Jensen]] takes over the drivetime slot that Dave vacates.
**12 November – The Sunday teatime chart show is extended from a Top 20 countdown to a Top 40 countdown. [[Simon Bates]] is the presenter, having taken over as host from [[Tom Browne (broadcaster)|Tom Browne]] earlier in the year.
**17 November – [[Tommy Vance]], one of the station's original presenters, rejoins Radio 1 to present a new programme, ''[[The Friday Rock Show]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://genome.ch.bbc.co.uk/schedules/radio1/england/1978-11-17|title=BBC Radio 1 England – 17 November 1978 – BBC Genome|website=genome.ch.bbc.co.uk|accessdate=14 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Consequently, [[John Peel]] is now on air four nights a week instead of five.
**23 November – Radio 1 moves from 247m (1214&amp;nbsp;kHz) to 275 &amp; 285m (1053 &amp; 1089&amp;nbsp;kHz) medium wave as part of a plan to improve national AM reception, and to conform with the [[Geneva Frequency Plan of 1975]].&lt;ref name="radiorewind1"&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.radiorewind.co.uk/radio1/transmitter.htm|title= Radio 1 History – Transmitters|publisher= Radio Rewind|accessdate= 18 February 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.frequencyfinder.org.uk/History_Transmission.pdf|title = History of Radio Transmission in the UK|publisher= Frequency Finder}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

*'''1979'''
**29 January – Radio 1 begins its delayed weeknight mid-evening programme with [[Andy Peebles]] joining to host the new programme. It had originally been scheduled to launch on 13 November 1978 but was delayed as a result of [[Winter of Discontent|trade union disputes]].

==1980s==

*'''1980'''
**5 January – [[Tony Blackburn]] replaces [[Ed Stewart]] as host of ''[[Junior Choice]]'', and [[Steve Wright (DJ)|Steve Wright]] joins to present the Saturday evening show.

**6 March – ''[[Junior Choice]]'' leaves the airwaves and the weekend breakfast show is renamed ''The Saturday Show/The Sunday Show''. Children's requests continue to be a mainstay of the renamed show and [[Maggie Philbin]] and [[Keith Chegwin]] join Tony Blackburn as co-presenters.
**4 December – The transmission time lost in March 1980 is regained. Programmes once again begin at 6{{nbsp}}am, finally ending all simulcasts between Radio 1 and Radio 2.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://genome.ch.bbc.co.uk/schedules/radio1/england/1982-12-06|title=BBC Radio 1 England – 6 December 1982 – BBC Genome|website=genome.ch.bbc.co.uk|accessdate=14 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Mike Smith (broadcaster)|Mike Smith]] returns to the station – he had been a presenter and producer in the mid 1970s – to present the new weekday early show.

{{VG Industry}}
The '''video game industry''' is the [[economic sector]] involved in the [[Video game development|development]], marketing, and [[Video game monetization|monetization of video games]]. It encompasses dozens of [[job]] disciplines and its component parts employ thousands of people worldwide.&lt;ref&gt;Zackariasson, P. and Wilson, T.L. eds. (2012). ''The Video Game Industry: Formation, Present State, and Future''. New York: Routledge.
&lt;/ref&gt;

== Overview ==
The computer and video game industry has grown from focused markets to mainstream. They took in about [[United States dollar|US$]]9.5 billion in the US in 2007, 11.7 billion in 2008, and 25.1 billion in 2010 ([[Entertainment Software Association|ESA]] annual report).

Modern [[personal computer]]s owe many advancements and innovations to the game industry: [[sound card]]s, [[graphics card]]s and [[3D graphic accelerator]]s, faster [[CPU]]s, and dedicated co-processors like [[PhysX]] are a few of the more notable improvements.

[[Sound card]]s were developed for addition of digital-quality sound to games and only later improved for music and [[audiophile]]s.&lt;ref name="sndhist"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://alldidigames.com/video-games-industry-infographics/ | publisher=Didi Games | work=Research on Video Games | author=Bob Johnstone | title=Didi Games | accessdate=April 1, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Early on, graphics cards were developed for more colors.&lt;ref name="sndhist"/&gt; Later, graphic cards were developed for [[graphical user interface]]s (GUIs) and games; GUIs drove the need for high resolution, and games began using 3D acceleration.&lt;ref name="sndhist"/&gt; They also are one of the only pieces of hardware to allow multiple hookups (such as with [[Scan Line Interleave|SLI]] or [[ATI CrossFire|CrossFire]] graphics cards).&lt;ref name="sndhist"/&gt; CD- and DVD-ROMs were developed for mass distribution of media in general; however the ability to store more information on cheap easily distributable media was instrumental in driving their ever-higher speeds.&lt;ref name="sndhist"/&gt;

== Game industry value chain ==
Ben Sawyer of Digitalmill observes that the game industry [[value chain]] is made up of six connected and distinctive layers:
# Capital and publishing layer: involved in paying for development of new titles and seeking returns through licensing of the titles.
# Product and talent layer: includes [[Video game developer|developers]], [[video game designer|designers]] and [[game artist|artists]], who may be working under individual contracts or as part of in-house development teams.
# Production and tools layer: generates content [[game tool|production tools]], game development [[Game Middleware|middleware]], [[Game engine|customizable game engines]], and production management tools.
# Distribution layer: or the "[[video game publisher|publishing]]" industry, involved in generating and marketing catalogs of games for retail and online distribution.
# Hardware (or Virtual Machine or Software Platform) layer: or the providers of the underlying platform, which may be console-based, accessed through online media, or accessed through mobile devices such as [[smartphones]]. This layer now includes network infrastructure and non-hardware platforms such as virtual machines (e.g. Java or Flash), or software platforms such as browsers or even further Facebook, etc.
# End-users layer: or the users/players of the games.&lt;ref name="newmedia"&gt;

== Disciplines ==
The game industry employs those experienced in other traditional businesses, but some have experience tailored to the game industry. Some of the disciplines specific to the game industry include: [[game programmer]], [[game designer]], [[level designer]], [[game producer]], [[game artist]] and [[game tester]]. Most of these professionals are employed by [[video game developer]]s or [[video game publisher]]s. However, many [[hobby]]ists also produce computer games and sell them commercially.{{Citation needed|date=March 2009}}  Game developers and publishers sometimes employ those with extensive or long-term experience within the [[Mod (video gaming)|modding]] communities.&lt;ref&gt;http://uncommonculture.org/ojs/index.php/fm/article/view/2965/2526#36&lt;/ref&gt;

=== 1940s–1960s ===

{{main|Early history of video games|Early mainframe games}}
Prior to the 1970s, there was no significant commercial aspect of the video game industry, but many advances in computing would set the stage for the birth of the industry.

Many early publicly-available interactive computer-based game machines used or other mechanisms to mimic a display; while technically not "video games", they had elements of interactivity between the player and the machine. Some examples of these included the 1940 "Nimatron", an electromagentic relay-based [[Nim]]-playing device designed by [[Edward Condon]] and built by [[Westinghouse Electric (1886)|Westinghouse Electric]] for the [[1939 New York World's Fair|New York World's Fair]],&lt;ref name="Priest"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://videogamehistorian.wordpress.com/2014/01/22/the-priesthood-at-play-computer-games-in-the-1950s/|title=The Priesthood At Play: Computer Games in the 1950s |work=They Create Worlds|last=Smith|first=Alexander|date=2014-01-22|accessdate=2015-12-18|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151222172058/https://videogamehistorian.wordpress.com/2014/01/22/the-priesthood-at-play-computer-games-in-the-1950s/|archivedate=2015-12-22|deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Bertie the Brain]]'', an arcade game of [[tic-tac-toe]], built by [[Josef Kates]] for the 1950 [[Canadian National Exhibition]],&lt;ref name="CNE"&gt;{{cite news|first=Marlene|last=Simmons|title=Bertie the Brain programmer heads science council |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=rKYyAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=pe0FAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=916,3790974&amp;dq=josef-kates&amp;hl=en |newspaper=[[Ottawa Citizen]]|date=1975-10-09|page=17|accessdate=2015-12-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Nimrod (computing)|Nimrod]] created by engineering firm [[Ferranti]] for the 1951 [[Festival of Britain]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=[[Replay: The History of Video Games]]|last=Donovan|first=Tristan|publisher=Yellow Ant|date=2010-04-20|isbn=978-0-9565072-0-4|pages=1–9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The development of [[cathode ray tube]]&amp;mdash;the core technology behind televisions&amp;mdash;created several of the first true video games. In 1947 Thomas T. Goldsmith Jr. and Estle Ray Mann filed a patent for a "cathode ray tube amusement device". Their game, which uses a cathode ray tube hooked to an oscilloscope display, challenges players to fire a gun at target.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.museumofplay.org/about/icheg/video-game-history/timeline |title=Video Game History Timeline &amp;#124; The Strong |publisher=Museumofplay.org |date= |accessdate=2018-06-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Between the 1950s and 1960s, with mainframe computers becoming available to campus colleges, students and others started to develop games that could be played at terminals that accessed the mainframe. One of the first known examples is ''[[Spacewar!]]'', developed by Harvard and MIT employees Martin Graetz, [[Steve Russell (computer scientist)|Steve Russell]], and Wayne Wiitanen.&lt;ref name="Space"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://videogamehistorian.wordpress.com/2014/08/07/one-two-three-four-i-declare-a-space-war/|title=One, Two, Three, Four I Declare a Space War|work=They Create Worlds|last=Smith|first=Alexander|date=2014-08-07|accessdate=2015-12-18|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151222172136/https://videogamehistorian.wordpress.com/2014/08/07/one-two-three-four-i-declare-a-space-war/|archivedate=2015-12-22|deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt; The introduction of easy-to-program languages like [[BASIC]] for mainframes allowed for more simplistic games to be developed.

However, both the arcade and home markets would be dominated by ''Pong'' clones, which flooded the market and led to the [[video game crash of 1977]]. The crash eventually came to an end with the success of [[Taito Corporation|Taito]]'s ''[[Space Invaders]]'', released in 1978, sparking a renaissance for the video game industry and paving the way for the [[golden age of video arcade games]].&lt;ref name="Whittaker-122"&gt;{{Cite book|title=The cyberspace handbook|author=Jason Whittaker|publisher=[[Routledge]]|year=2004|isbn=0-415-16835-X|page=122|postscript=&lt;!-- Bot inserted parameter.

The early part of the decade saw the rise of [[8-bit]] home computing, and [[Homebrew (video games)|home-made games]], especially in Europe (with the [[ZX Spectrum]] and [[Commodore 64]]) and Asia (with the [[NEC PC-8801|NEC PC-88]] and [[MSX]]). This time also saw the rise of [[video game journalism]], which was later expanded to include [[covermount]]ed cassettes and CDs.
In 1983, the [[North American video game crash of 1983|North American industry crashed]] due to the production of too many badly developed games (quantity over quality), resulting in the fall of the North American industry. The industry would eventually be revitalized by the release of the [[Nintendo Entertainment System]], which resulted in the home console market being dominated by Japanese companies such as [[Nintendo]],&lt;ref name="newmedia" /&gt; while a professional European computer game industry also began taking shape with companies such as [[Ocean Software]] and [[Gremlin Interactive]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.worldofspectrum.org/ystop100.html|title=World of Spectrum - Archive - YS Top 100|work=worldofspectrum.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; The latter part of the decade saw the rise of the [[Game Boy]] handheld system. In 1987, Nintendo lost a legal challenge against [[Blockbuster Entertainment]], which enabled games rentals in the same way as movies.

=== 1990s ===
[[File:PlayStation-SCPH-1000-with-Controller.png|thumb|right|The [[PlayStation (console)|PlayStation]] was the most popular gaming console of the fifth generation, which saw the common adoption of CD media.]]
{{see also|History of video game consoles (fourth generation)|History of video game consoles (fifth generation)|History of video game consoles (sixth generation)}}

The 1990s saw advancements in game related technology. Among the significant advancements were:
* The widespread adoption of [[compact disc|CD]]-based storage and software distribution
* Widespread adoption of [[graphical user interface|GUI]]-based [[operating system]]s, such as the series of [[Amiga OS]], [[Microsoft Windows]] and [[Mac OS]]
* Advancement in 3D graphics technology, as [[Graphics processing unit|3D graphic cards]] became widely adopted, with [[3D computer graphics|3D graphics]] now the ''[[de facto]]'' standard for video game visual presentation
* Continuing advancement of [[CPU]] speed and sophistication
* Miniaturisation of hardware, and mobile phones, which enabled [[mobile gaming]]
* The emergence of the internet, which in the latter part of the decade enabled online co-operative play and [[competitive gaming]]

Aside from technology, in the early part of the decade, [[brand licensing|licensed]] games became more popular,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Fahs |first=Travis |url=http://uk.retro.ign.com/articles/896/896893p1.html |title=IGN Presents the History of Madden - Retro Feature at IGN |publisher=Uk.retro.ign.com |date=August 8, 2008 |accessdate=November 9, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Hurby |first=Patrick |url=http://sports.espn.go.com/espn/eticket/story?page=100805/madden |title=ESPN - OTL: The Franchise - E-ticket |publisher=Sports.espn.go.com |accessdate=November 9, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; as did video game sequels.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=McLaughlin |first=Rus |url=http://uk.retro.ign.com/articles/954/954426p2.html |title=IGN Presents the History of Street Fighter - Retro Feature at IGN |publisher=Uk.retro.ign.com |date=July 7, 2010 |accessdate=November 9, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== 2000s ===
{{see also|History of video game consoles (sixth generation)|History of video game consoles (seventh generation)}}

In 2000s, the video game industry is a juggernaut of development; profit still drives technological advancement which is then used by other industry sectors. Technologies such as [[Smartphones]], [[virtual reality]] and [[augmented reality]] are major drivers for game hardware and gameplay development. Though maturing, the video game industry was still very volatile, with third-party video game developers quickly cropping up, and just as quickly, going out of business.{{Citation needed|date=March 2009}} Nevertheless, many [[casual game]]s and [[indie game]]s were developed and become popular and successful, such as ''[[Braid (video game)|Braid]]'' and ''[[Limbo (video game)|Limbo]]''. Game development for mobile phones (such as [[iOS]] and [[Android (operating system)|Android]] devices) and social networking sites emerged. For example, a [[Facebook]] game developer, [[Zynga]], has raised in excess of $300 million.{{Clarify|date=March 2011}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://techcrunch.com/2009/12/15/zynga-takes-180-million-venture-round-cue-russian-mafia-jokes/ |title=Zynga Takes $180 Million Venture Round From DST, Others (Cue Russian Mafia Jokes) |publisher=TechCrunch |date=December 15, 2009 |accessdate=February 11, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== 2010s ===
{{see also|History of video game consoles (eighth generation)}}

Though not the main driving force, [[independent video games|indie games]] continue to have a significant impact on the industry, with sales of some of these titles such as ''[[Spelunky]]'', ''[[Fez]]'', ''[[Don't Starve]]'', ''[[Castle Crashers]]'', and ''[[Minecraft]]'', exceeding millions of [[United States dollar|dollars]] and over a million users.&lt;ref name="entrepreneurial-insights.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.entrepreneurial-insights.com/gaming-industry-introduction/|title=The Gaming Industry – An Introduction|work=Entrepreneurial Insights}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{unreliable?|date=February 2017}} The 2010s have seen a larger shift to casual and [[mobile gaming]]; in 2016, the mobile gaming market is estimated to have taken $38 billion in revenues, compared to $6 billion for the console market and $33 billion for personal computing gaming.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.gamesindustry.biz/articles/2016-10-24-welcome-to-the-new-era-games-as-media | title = Welcome to the New Era: Games as Media | first = Joost | last = van Dreunen | date = October 24, 2016 | accessdate = October 31, 2016 | work = [[GamesIndustry.biz]] }}&lt;/ref&gt; Games centered on [[virtual reality]] and [[augmented reality]] equipment also arose during this decade. As of 2014, newer game companies arose that vertically integrate live operations and publishing such as crowdfunding and other direct-to-consumer efforts, rather than relying on a traditional publishers, and some of these have grown to substantial size.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://medium.com/business-startup-development-and-more/50e5d9379521 |title=The Future of Games and How to Stop It |last1=Radoff |first1=Jon |last2= |first2= |date=February 10, 2014 |website=medium.com |publisher=medium.com |accessdate=February 11, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Spurred by some initial events in the late 2000s, [[eSports]] centered around professional players in organized competitions and leagues for prize money, grew greatly over this decade, drawing hundreds of millions of viewers and reaching nearly $500 million in revenue by 2016 and expected to break $1 billion by 2019.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url = http://www.cnn.com/2016/05/29/sport/esports-revolution-revenue-audience-growth/index.html | title = ESports: Global revenue expected to smash $1 billion by 2019 | first = Don | last=  Riddell | date = May 29, 2016 | accessdate = January 16, 2018  | work = [[CNN]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Economics ==
Early on, development costs were minimal, and video games could be quite profitable. Games developed by a single programmer, or by a small team of programmers and artists, could sell hundreds of thousands of copies each. Many of these games only took a few months to create, so developers could release multiple titles per year. Thus, publishers could often be generous with benefits, such as [[royalties]] on the games sold. Many early game publishers started from this economic climate, such as [[Origin Systems]], [[Sierra Entertainment]], [[Capcom]], [[Activision]] and [[Electronic Arts]].

As computing and graphics power increased, so too did the size of development teams, as larger staffs were needed to address the ever-increasing technical and design complexities. The larger teams consist of programmers, artists, game designers, and producers. Their salaries can range anywhere from $50,000 to $120,000 generating large labor costs for firms producing videogames&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bigfishgames.com/blog/video-gaming-industry-numbers-by-region/|title=Top Gaming Studios, Schools &amp; Salaries|work=Big Fish Games}}&lt;/ref&gt; which can often take between one and three years to develop. Now budgets typically reach millions of dollars despite the growing popularity of [[Game Middleware|middleware]] and pre-built [[game engine]]s.  In addition to growing development costs, marketing budgets have grown dramatically, sometimes consisting of two to three times of the cost of development.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Superannuation|title=How Much Does It Cost To Make A Big Video Game?|url=http://kotaku.com/how-much-does-it-cost-to-make-a-big-video-game-1501413649|website=Kotaku|publisher=Gawker Media|accessdate=October 30, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The game development team has to select a profitable and suitable method [[Video game monetization|to sell or earn money from]] the finished game. Traditionally, the game monetization method is to sell hard copies in retail store. Now some developers are turning to alternative production and distribution methods, such as [[digital distribution|online distribution]], to reduce costs and increase revenue.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Kain|first1=Erik|title=Why Digital Distribution Is The Future And GameStop Is Not: Taking The Long View On Used Games|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/erikkain/2013/05/30/why-digital-distribution-is-the-future-and-gamestop-is-not-taking-the-long-view-on-used-games/|website=Forbes|accessdate=October 30, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Today, the video game industry has a major impact on the economy through the sales of major systems and games such as ''[[Call of Duty: Black Ops]]'', which took in over $650 [[United States dollar|USD]] million of sales in the game's first five days and which set a five-day global record for a movie, book or videogame.&lt;ref&gt;[http://blog.games.yahoo.com/blog/278-call-of-duty-black-ops-sets-record-for-activision "Call of Duty: Black Ops" sets record for Activision"] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110125022802/http://blog.games.yahoo.com/blog/278-call-of-duty-black-ops-sets-record-for-activision |date=January 25, 2011 }}.

The industry wide adoption of high-definition graphics during the seventh generation of consoles greatly increased development teams' sizes and reduced the number of [[Triple A (gaming)|high-budget, high-quality titles]] under development. In 2013 [[Richard Hilleman]] of Electronic Arts estimated that only 25 developers were working on such titles for the eighth console generation, compared to 125 at the same point in the seventh generation-console cycle seven or eight years earlier.&lt;ref name="vgchartz20130706"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.vgchartz.com/article/251108/ea-aaa-development-in-decline/ | title=EA: AAA Development in Decline | work=VGChartz | date=July 6, 2013 | accessdate=July 8, 2013 | author=D'Angelo, William}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Retail ===

The games industry's shift from brick and mortar retail to digital downloads led to a severe sales decline at video game retailers such as [[GameStop]], following other media retailers superseded by Internet delivery, such as [[Blockbuster (company)|Blockbuster]], [[Tower Records (music retailer)|Tower Records]], and [[Virgin Megastores]]. GameStop diversified its services by purchasing chains that repair wireless devices and expanding its trade-in program through which customers trade used games for credit towards new games.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |last1=Wingfield |first1=Nick |title=As Downloads Take Over, a Turning Point for the Video Game Industry |work=[[The New York Times]] |date=2015-12-20 |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2015/12/21/technology/as-downloads-take-over-a-turning-point-for-the-video-game-industry.html |issn=0362-4331 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; The company began to produce its own merchandise and games. In Britain, the games retailer [[Game (retailer)|Game]] revamped its stores so customers would spend time playing games there. It built a gaming arena for events and tournaments.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Dring |first1=Christopher |title=GAME launches Belong - is this the future of video games retail? |work=GamesIndustry.biz |date=2016-12-16 |url=http://www.gamesindustry.biz/articles/2016-12-15-game-launches-belong-is-this-the-future-of-video-games-retail |accessdate=2017-06-30 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; The shift to digital marketplaces, especially for smartphones, led to an influx of inexpensive and disposable titles,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |last1=Suellentrop |first1=Chris |last2=Totilo |first2=Stephen |title=Video Game Retail Sales Decline Despite New Hits |work=[[The New York Times]] |date=2012-10-03 |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2012/10/07/arts/video-games/video-game-retail-sales-decline-despite-new-hits.html |issn=0362-4331 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as lower engagement among gamers who otherwise purchased new games from retail.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Dring |first1=Christopher |title=What's going wrong at UK games retail? |work=GamesIndustry.biz |date=2016-11-21 |url=http://www.gamesindustry.biz/articles/2016-11-21-whats-going-wrong-at-games-retail |accessdate=2017-06-30 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!-- more in this source --&gt; Customers also shifted away from the tradition of buying games on their first day of release.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Dring |first1=Christopher |title=Is the industry's obsession with Day One coming to an end? |work=GamesIndustry.biz |date=2016-11-08 |url=http://www.gamesindustry.biz/articles/2016-11-07-is-the-industrys-obsession-with-day-one-coming-to-an-end |accessdate=2017-06-30 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Publishers often funded trade-in deals to encourage consumers to purchase new games. Trade-in customers at the Australia retailer Game would purchase twice the games per year as non-trade-in customers. The sale of pre-owned games kept retailers in business, and composed about a third of Game's revenue. Retailers also saved on the UK's value-added tax, which only taxed the retailer's profit on pre-owned games, rather than the full sale on regular games. The former trade-in retail executives behind the trade-in price comparison site Trade In Detectives estimated that the United Kingdom's trade-in industry was about a third of the size of its new games business.{{r|Eurogamer: trade-in myths}} They figured that sites such as [[eBay]], which convert used games into cash, compose about a quarter of the UK's trade-in market,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Parfitt |first1=Ben |title=Pre-owned price comparison site Trade In Detectives goes live |work=[[MCV UK]] |date=2013-08-07 |url=http://www.mcvuk.com/news/read/pre-owned-price-comparison-site-trade-in-detectives-goes-live/0119776 |accessdate=2017-06-30 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; but do not keep the credit within the industry. While consumers might appear to receive better offers on these sites, they also take about 15 percent of the selling price in fees. Alternatively, some retailers will match the trade-in values offered by their competitors. Microsoft's original plan for the Xbox One attempted to translate trade-in deals for the digital marketplace, with a database of product licenses that shops would be able to resell with publisher permission, though the plan was poorly received or poorly sold.&lt;ref name="Eurogamer: trade-in myths"&gt;{{cite web |last1=Purchese |first1=Robert |title=Myth-busting the murky world of video game trade-ins |work=[[Eurogamer]] |date=2013-12-18 |url=http://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2013-12-03-myth-busting-the-murky-world-of-video-game-trade-ins |accessdate=2017-06-30 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Practices ==
Video game industry practices are similar to those of other entertainment industries (e.g., the [[recording industry|music recording industry]]), but the video game industry in particular has been accused of treating its development talent poorly. This promotes independent development, as developers leave to form new companies and projects. In some notable cases, these new companies grow large and impersonal, having adopted the business practices of their forebears, and ultimately perpetuate the cycle.

However, unlike the music industry, where modern technology has allowed a fully professional product to be created extremely inexpensively by an independent musician, modern games require increasing amounts of manpower and equipment. This dynamic makes [[video game publisher|publishers]], who fund the [[video game developer|developers]], much more important than in the music industry.

=== Breakaways ===
In the video game industry, it is common for developers to leave their current studio and start their own. A particularly famous case is the "original" independent developer [[Activision]], founded by former [[Atari]] developers. Activision grew to become the world's second largest game publisher.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.thestreet.com/story/10224904/activision-aims-for-sweet-spot.html|title=Activision Aims for Sweet Spot|last=Wolverton|first=Troy|date=May 24, 2005|publisher=TheStreet.com|accessdate=March 30, 2009|archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5ffLSaAf0?url=http://www.thestreet.com/story/10224904/activision-aims-for-sweet-spot.html|archivedate=March 30, 2009|deadurl=yes|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the mean time, many of the original developers left to work on other projects. For example, founder [[Alan Miller (game designer)|Alan Miller]] left Activision to start another video game development company, [[Accolade (company)|Accolade]] (now [[Atari]] née [[Infogrames]]).

Activision was popular among developers for giving them credit in the packaging and title screens for their games, while Atari disallowed this practice. As the video game industry took off in the mid-1980s, many developers faced the more distressing problem of working with fly-by-night or unscrupulous publishers that would either fold unexpectedly or run off with the game profits.

=== Piracy ===
The industry claims [[software piracy]] to be a big problem, and take measures to counter this.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Valjalo |first=David |url=http://www.next-gen.biz/news/3ds-will-fight-piracy-firmware |title=3DS Will Fight Piracy With Firmware &amp;#124; Edge Magazine |publisher=Next-gen.biz |date=October 4, 2010 |accessdate=November 9, 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6EN2nGrc6?url=http://www.edge-online.com/news/3ds-will-fight-piracy-firmware/ |archivedate=February 12, 2013 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; 
[[Digital rights management]] have proved to be the most unpopular with gamers, as a measure to counter piracy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/technology/7972677.stm |title=Technology &amp;#124; EA 'dumps DRM' for next Sims game |publisher=BBC News |date=March 31, 2009 |accessdate=November 9, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The most popular and effective strategy to counter piracy is to change the business model to [[Freemium]], where gamers pay for their in-game needs or service. Strong server-side security is required for this, to properly distinguish authentic transactions from [[Cheating in video games|hacked]] (faked) transactions.

=== Creative control ===
On various Internet forums, some gamers have expressed disapproval of publishers having creative control since publishers are more apt to follow short-term market trends rather than invest in risky but potentially lucrative ideas. On the other hand, publishers may know better than developers what consumers want. The relationship between video game developers and publishers parallels the relationship between [[Recording Artists' Coalition|recording artists]] and [[RIAA|record labels]] in many ways. But unlike the [[music industry]], which has seen flat or declining sales in the early 2000s,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ifpi.org/content/section_news/20021010.html|title=Global sales of recorded music down 9.2% in the first half of 2002 from IFPI|work=ifpi.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ifpi.org/content/section_news/20031001.html|title=Global sales of recorded music down 10.9% in the first half of 2003 from IFPI|work=ifpi.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ifpi.org/content/section_news/20051003.html|title=Digital sales triple to 6% of industry retail revenues as global music market falls 1.9% (2005) from IFPI|work=ifpi.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; the video game industry continues to grow.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/idUSN2132172920070621|title=Video game industry growth still strong: study|work=Reuters}}&lt;/ref&gt; Also, personal computers have made the independent development of music almost effortless, while the gap between an independent game developer and the product of a fully financed one grows larger.

In the [[computer game]]s industry, it is easier to create a startup, resulting in many successful companies. The [[video game console|console]] games industry is a more closed one, and a game developer must have up to three licenses from the [[console manufacturer]]:
# A license to develop games for the console
# The publisher must have a license to publish games for the console
# A separate license for each game

In addition, the developer must usually buy development systems from the console manufacturer in order to even develop a game for consideration, as well as obtain concept approval for the game from the console manufacturer. Therefore, the developer normally has to have a publishing deal in place before starting development on a game project, but in order to secure a publishing deal, the developer must have a track record of console development, something which few startups will have.

=== Alternatives ===
An alternative method for publishing video games is to self-publish using the [[shareware]] or [[Open-source software|open source]] model over the [[Internet]].

=== Gaming conventions ===
[[Gaming convention]]s are an important showcase of the industry.

[[Image:Gamescom 2009 - Koelnmesse Südeingang (5473).jpg|thumb|The [[gamescom]] in [[Cologne]], the major gaming fair by attendance.]]
[[Gaming convention]]s are an important showcase of the industry. The annual [[gamescom]] in [[Cologne]] (Germany) is a major expo for video games. The [[Electronic Entertainment Expo|E3]] in [[Los Angeles]] (USA) is also of global importance, but is an event for industry insiders only.&lt;ref name="Forbes"/&gt;

Other notable conventions and trade fairs include [[Tokyo Game Show]] (Japan), [[Brasil Game Show]] (Brazil), [[EB Games Expo]] (Australia), [[Russian Game Developers Conference|KRI]] (Russia), [[China Digital Entertainment Expo &amp; Conference|ChinaJoy]] (China) and the annual [[Game Developers Conference]]. Some publishers, developers and technology producers also have their own regular conventions, with [[BlizzCon]], [[QuakeCon]], [[Nvision]] and the [[X (Xbox show)|X shows]] being prominent examples.

=== Africa ===

Video gaming is still in its infancy throughout the African continent, but due to the continent's young population and increasing technological literacy, the sector is growing rapidly. African countries such as [[video gaming in South Africa|South Africa]], [[video gaming in Nigeria|Nigeria]] and [[video gaming in Kenya|Kenya]] have been making rapid advances in [[mobile gaming|mobile game development]], both within their country and internationally,&lt;ref name="Africa top 10"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.itnewsafrica.com/2013/10/top-10-african-game-developers/|title=Top 10 African game developers|publisher=''[[IT News Africa]]''|last=Fripp|first=Charlie|date=15 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; but due to limited funding and a market over-crowded with western games, success has thus far been minimal.&lt;ref name="Mail &amp; Guardian"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://mgafrica.com/article/2014-12-02-things-africa-will-be-famous-for-in-the-next-10-15-years|title=Africa 2030, the next 25 years: From video games, eco-buildings, robotics, and cycling|publisher=''[[Mail &amp; Guardian]] Africa''|last=Spooner|first=Samantha|date=January 5, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Interactive Entertainment]] and [[Strategy First]], mainly because video games jobs have been heavily subsidized by the provincial government. Every year, this industry generates billions of dollars and thousands of jobs in the Montreal area.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tourisme-montreal.org/meetings/2015/01/20/business-sectors/|title=What are the leading business sectors in Montréal?

The ''[[Assassin's Creed]]'' series, along with the ''[[Tom Clancy]]'' series have all been produced in Canada and have achieved worldwide success. For consumers, the largest video games convention in Canada is the Enthusiast Gaming Live Expo (EGLX).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Kevin Carignan |url=https://www.destructoid.com/dtoid-is-hosting-canada-s-largest-gaming-event-eglx-returns-march-9-11-2018-469022.phtml |title=Dtoid is hosting Canada's largest gaming event!

{{main|Video gaming in Germany}}

[[Germany]] has the largest video games market in Europe, with revenues of $4.1&amp;nbsp;billion forecast for 2017.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://newzoo.com/insights/rankings/top-100-countries-by-game-revenues/|title=Top 100 Countries By Game Revenues|last=|first=|date=January 2017|website=newzoo.com|accessdate=October 1, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The annual [[gamescom]] in [[Cologne]] is Europe's largest gaming expo.

One of the earliest internationally successful video game companies was [[Gütersloh]]-based [[Rainbow Arts]] (founded in 1984) who were responsible for publishing the popular ''[[Turrican]]'' series of games. The [[Anno (series)|Anno series]] and [[The Settlers|The Settlers series]] are globally popular strategy game franchises since the 1990s. The [[Gothic series]], [[SpellForce: The Order of Dawn|SpellForce]] and [[Risen (video game)|Risen]] are established RPG franchises. The [[X (game series)|X series]] by [[Egosoft]] is the best-selling space simulation. The [[FIFA Manager (video game series)|FIFA Manager series]] was also developed in Germany. The German action game [[Spec Ops: The Line]] (2012) was successful in the markets and received largely positive reviews. One of the most famed titles to come out of Germany is ''[[Far Cry]]'' (2004) by [[Frankfurt]]-based [[Crytek]], who also produced the topseller ''[[Crysis]]'' and its sequels later.

Other well-known current and former developers from Germany include [[Ascaron]], [[Blue Byte]], [[Deck13 Interactive|Deck13]], [[EA Phenomic|Phenomic]], [[Piranha Bytes]], [[Radon Labs|Radon]], [[Related Designs|Related]], [[Spellbound Entertainment|Spellbound]] and [[Yager Development]]. Publishers include [[Deep Silver]] ([[Koch Media]]), [[dtp entertainment]], [[Kalypso Media|Kalypso]] and [[Nintendo|Nintendo Europe]]. [[Bigpoint Games]], [[Gameforge]], [[Goodgame Studios]] and [[Wooga]] are among the world's leading browser game and social network game developers/distributors.

=== Japan ===
{{main|Video gaming in Japan}}
[[File:Nintendo office.jpg|thumb|right|Headquarters of [[Nintendo]] in [[Kyoto]], Japan, 2006.]]
The [[Japan]]ese video game industry is markedly different from the industry in North America, Europe and Australia.

&lt;!-- Generally, games have a greater [[market share]] of total entertainment in Japan than in the West.{{Citation needed|date=August 2010}} --&gt;
Japanese companies have created some of the largest and most lucrative titles ever made, such as the ''[[Mario]]'', ''[[Final Fantasy]]'', ''[[Metal Gear]]'', ''[[Pokémon]]'' and ''[[Resident Evil]]'' series of games.

&lt;!-- [[Video arcade|Video game arcades]] are still relatively popular in Japan; for every [[arcade game]] released in the US, nine are released in [[Japan]].{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}} The history of the Japanese arcade is very significant in the story of the decline of the American arcade, and in the shape of [[game design]] in general. --&gt;
In recent years, [[video game console|consoles]] and arcade games have both been overtaken by downloadable [[free-to-play]] games on the [[PC game|PC]] and [[Mobile game|mobile]] platforms.&lt;ref name=economist12&gt;{{cite news|title=Japan fights back|url=https://www.economist.com/news/business/21566696-two-japanese-firms-are-challenging-world-new-kind-video-game-japan-fights-back|publisher=The Economist|date=November 17, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=capcom_marketdata&gt;{{cite web|title=Market Data|url=http://www.capcom.co.jp/ir/english/business/market.html|publisher=[[Capcom]]|accessdate=October 5, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!-- The structure and culture of a Japanese game developer is different from a western one. Throughout the history of Japanese game design, many developers have seen fit to remain mostly anonymous, even using pseudonyms to a large degree in video game credits.{{Citation needed|date=June 2010}}

Also, the division in labor for video game development is different. For example, Japanese game design teams had a dedicated [[game designer|designer]] (which they called a "director") much earlier than American design teams adopted the practice.{{Citation needed|date=June 2010}}
Secondly, Japanese game designers throughout history generally had far more people working on a particular game than a comparable western design team. For example, ''[[Street Fighter 2]]'' (1992), a Japanese title, had almost one artist working on every character in the game, plus two programmers and a musician, with the result being a team of twenty or more people.  ''[[Mortal Kombat (video game)|Mortal Kombat]]'' (1992), a comparable American title, was developed by four people: a [[game programmer|programmer]], an [[artist]], a [[musician]], and a background artist.{{Citation needed|date=June 2010}} --&gt;

=== United Kingdom ===
{{main|Video gaming in the United Kingdom}}

The [[United Kingdom|UK]] industry is the third largest in the World in terms of developer success and sales of hardware and software by country alone but fourth behind Canada in terms of people employed.&lt;ref name="networkworld1"/&gt; The size of the UK game industry is comparable to its film or music industries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gamesindustry.biz/articles/2016-04-04-view-from-the-tower|title=The View From the Tower|publisher=gamesindustry.biz}}&lt;/ref&gt; In recent years some of the studios have become defunct or been purchased by larger companies such as ''[[LittleBigPlanet]]'' developer, [[Media Molecule]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://blog.eu.playstation.com/2010/03/02/media-molecule-officially-joins-the-playstation-family/ |title=Media Molecule Officially Joins The PlayStation Family – PlayStation.Blog.Europe |publisher=Blog.eu.playstation.com |date=March 2, 2010 |accessdate=January 27, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Codemasters]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Hinkle |first=David |url=http://www.joystiq.com/2010/04/05/reliance-big-entertainment-acquires-50-stake-in-codemasters |title=Reliance Big Entertainment acquires 50% stake in Codemasters |publisher=Joystiq |date=April 5, 2010 |accessdate=November 9, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The country is home to some of the world's most successful video game franchises, such as ''[[Tomb Raider]]'', ''[[Grand Theft Auto]]'', ''[[Fable (video game series)|Fable]]'', ''[[Colin McRae: Dirt|Colin McRae Dirt]]'' and ''[[Total War (series)|Total War]]''.

The country also went without tax relief until March 21, 2012&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Henderson |first=Rik |url=http://www.pocket-lint.com/news/44996/budget-2012-tax-relief-video-games |title=UK tax relief break |date=March 21, 2012 |accessdate= March 31, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; when the British government changed its mind on tax relief for UK developers, which without, meant most of the talented development within the UK may move overseas for more profit, along with parents of certain video game developers which would pay for having games developed in the UK. The industry trade body TIGA estimates that it will increase the games development sector's contribution to UK GDP by £283 million, generate £172 million in new and protected tax receipts to HM Treasury, and could cost just £96 million over five years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Post comment Name Email Address Comments |url=https://www.wired.co.uk/news/archive/2010-06/22/game-industry-tax-relief-plans-are-shelved |title=Game industry tax relief plans are shelved |publisher=Wired.co.uk |date=June 22, 2010 |accessdate=November 9, 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100625151807/http://www.wired.co.uk/news/archive/2010-06/22/game-industry-tax-relief-plans-are-shelved |archivedate=June 25, 2010 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Before the tax relief was introduced there was a fear that the UK games industry could fall behind other leading game industries around the world such as France and Canada, of which Canada overtook the UK in terms of job numbers in the industry in 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title=Canada overtakes UK |url=http://www.develop-online.net/news/34406/Canada-overtakes-UK-industry-workforce-tally |date=March 31, 2012 |accessdate=March 31, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====History====
[[Magnavox]] is credited for releasing the first [[video game console]], the [[Magnavox Odyssey|Odyssey]]. [[Activision]] was the first developer to create independent/third-party video games. Once the fastest-growing American company, [[Atari]] crashed in spectacular fashion, resulting in the [[North American video game crash of 1983]]. This resulted in the domination of the Japanese video game industry worldwide throughout the 1980s and 1990s.

====Companies====
The U.S. is home to major game development companies such as [[Activision Blizzard]] (''[[Call of Duty]]'', ''[[World of Warcraft]]''), [[Electronic Arts]] (''[[FIFA (video game series)|FIFA]]'', ''[[Battlefield (video game series)|Battlefield]]'', ''[[Mass Effect]]''), and [[Take-Two Interactive]] ([[Civilization (series)|Civilization]], [[NBA 2K (series)|''NBA 2K'' series]], ''[[Grand Theft Auto]]''). [[ZeniMax Media]] (''[[Doom (series)|Doom]]'', ''[[Fallout (series)|Fallout]]'', ''[[The Elder Scrolls]]'') is the world's largest privately held video game company.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dailytech.com/Zenimax+Claims+Carmack+Stole+Oculus+VR+Facebook+Barks+Back/article34869.htm|title=Zenimax Claims Carmack Stole Oculus VR, Facebook Barks Back|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Niantic, Inc.|Niantic]] (''[[Ingress (video game)|Ingress]]'', ''[[Pokémon Go]]'') is a notable mobile game developer.

[[Valve Corporation]] operates [[Steam (software)|Steam]], the largest computer gaming platform, with an active user base (~125 million) that rivals the combined user bases of the current console generation (~150 million).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vgchartz.com/|title=VGChartz}}&lt;/ref&gt; While not specifically focused on games, the largest mobile gaming platforms are operated by [[Google]] ([[Google Play]]), and [[Apple Inc.]] ([[App Store (iOS)|App Store]]), with the majority of mobile revenue coming from Asia.&lt;ref name=idcannie&gt;{{cite web|url=http://blog.appannie.com/app-annie-idc-portable-gaming-report-2013-q2/|author=App Annie, IDC|title=App Annie &amp; IDC Portable Gaming Report Q2 2013: iOS &amp; Google Play Game Revenue 4x Higher Than Gaming-Optimized Handhelds}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Microsoft]] operates [[Xbox]], the only major game console hardware franchise not controlled by a Japanese company.

Notable game engine developers include [[Epic Games]] ([[Unreal Engine]]) and [[Unity Technologies]] ([[Unity (game engine)|Unity]]).

====Regions====
The [[West Coast of the United States|West Coast]] is home to important video game conventions, such as [[Electronic Entertainment Expo]] (E3), one of the largest video game industry-only events in the world, and [[Penny Arcade Expo]] (PAX West), the largest public video game convention in [[North America]]. The West Coast is also home to many of the major American video game industry companies, particularly the regions of [[Los Angeles]], [[San Francisco Bay Area]], and [[Seattle]]. Major game development regions outside of the West Coast include the [[Northeastern United States|Northeast]] and [[Texas]].

====People====
Over 150 million Americans play video games, with an average age of 35 and a gender breakdown of 59 percent male and 41 percent female.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.theesa.com/about-esa/industry-facts/|title=Industry Facts|publisher=[[Entertainment Software Association]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; American gamers are more likely to vote than non-gamers, feel that the economy is the most important political issue, and lean [[conservative]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.theesa.com/article/new-study-finds-video-game-players-are-highly-engaged-politically/|title=New Study Finds Video Game Players Are Highly Engaged Politically|publisher=[[Entertainment Software Association]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Mario]] is named after [[Mario Segale]], a former landlord of [[Nintendo of America]]. Some [[Right-wing politics|right-wing]] and [[Left-wing politics|left-wing]] activists, including [[Jack Thompson (activist)|Jack Thompson]] and [[Anita Sarkeesian]], have met extreme resistance from the gaming public in response to the perceived politicizing of their art form.&lt;ref name=TC2&gt;{{cite web | url=https://techcrunch.com/2014/09/25/gamergate-an-issue-with-2-sides/ | title=#GamerGate – An Issue With Two Sides | author= Allum Bokhari | publisher=[[TechCrunch]] | accessdate= September 27, 2014|date=September 25, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Players become fourth-party developers, allowing for more [[Open-source software|open source]] models of [[game design]], development and engineering. Players also create [[Mod (computer gaming)|modifications]] (mods), which in some cases become just as popular as the original game for which they were created. An example of this is the game ''[[Counter-Strike (video game)|Counter-Strike]]'', which began as a mod of the video game ''[[Half-Life (video game)|Half-Life]]'' and eventually became a very successful, published game in its own right.

While this "community of modifiers" may only add up to approximately 1% of a particular game's user base, the number of those involved will grow as more games offer modifying opportunities (such as, by releasing [[source code]]) and the video user base swells. According to Ben Sawyer, as many as 600,000 established online game community developers existed as of 2012. This effectively added a new component to the [[video game industry#Game industry value chain|game industry value chain]] and if it continues to mature, it will integrate itself into the overall industry.&lt;ref name="newmedia" /&gt;

The industry has seen a shift towards games with [[Multiplayer video game|multiplayer]] facilities. A larger percentage of games on all types of platforms include some type of competitive online multiplayer capability.

In addition, the industry is experiencing further significant change driven by convergence, with technology and player comfort being the two primary reasons for this wave of industry convergence. Video games and related content can now be accessed and played on a variety of media, including: cable television, dedicated consoles, handheld devices and smartphones, through social networking sites or through an ISP, through a game developer's website, and online through a game console and/or home or office personal computer. In fact, 12% of U.S. households already make regular use of game consoles for accessing video content provided by online services such as Hulu and Netflix. In 2012, for the first time, entertainment usage passed multiplayer game usage on Xbox, meaning that users spent more time with online video and music services and applications than playing multiplayer games. This rapid type of industry convergence has caused the distinction between video game console and personal computers to disappear. A game console with high-speed microprocessors attached to a television set is, for all intents and purposes, a computer and monitor.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=University|first=Stanley J. Baran, Bryant|title=Introduction to Mass Communication : Media Literacy and Culture|date=2014|publisher=McGraw-Hill|location=New York|isbn=978-0-07-352621-8|pages=220–221|edition=Eighth Edition.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As this distinction has been diminished, players' willingness to play and access content on different platforms has increased. The growing video gamer demographic accounts for this trend, as former president of the Entertainment Software Association Douglas Lowenstein explained at the 10th E3 expo, "Looking ahead, a child born in 1995, E3's inaugural year, will be 19 years old in 2014. And according to Census Bureau data, by the year 2020, there will be 174 million Americans between the ages of 5 and 44. That's 174 million Americans who will have grown up with PlayStations, Xboxes, and GameCubes from their early childhood and teenage years...What this means is that the average gamer will be both older and, given their lifetime familiarity with playing interactive games, more sophisticated and discriminating about the games they play."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=University|first=Stanley J. Baran, Bryant|title=Introduction to Mass Communication : Media Literacy and Culture|date=2014|publisher=McGraw-Hill|location=New York|isbn=978-0-07-352621-8|page=221|edition=Eighth Edition.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Evidence of the increasing player willingness to play video games across a variety of media and different platforms can be seen in the rise of casual gaming on smartphones, tablets, and social networking sites as 92% of all smartphone and tablet owners play games at least once a week, 45% play daily, and industry estimates predict that, by 2016, one-third of all global mobile gaming revenue will come from tablets alone. Apple's App Store alone has more than 90,000 game apps, a growth of 1,400% since it went online. In addition, game revenues for iOS and Android mobile devices now exceed those of both Nintendo and Sony handheld gaming systems combined.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=University|first=Stanley J.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9022">{{other uses|Wigger (disambiguation)}}

'''''Wigger''''', or '''''wigga''''', is a slang term for a [[white people|white person]], typically middle to upper-class, and of European ethnic origin, who emulates the perceived mannerisms, [[African American Vernacular English|language]], and [[Hip hop fashion|fashions]] associated with [[African-American culture]], particularly [[hip hop]].{{sfn|Bernstein |2006 |p=607}} The term is a [[portmanteau]] of white and [[nigger]]. The term "nigger" has often been used disparagingly, and since the mid-20th century, particularly in the United States, its usage became unambiguously pejorative and it is viewed as a [[Racial slur|racist insult and slur]].

One dictionary defines the term as a slang, derogatory reference to "...a white youth who adopts black youth culture by adopting its speech, wearing its clothes, and listening to its music."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dictionary.reference.com/browse/wigger |title=Wigger &amp;#124; Define Wigger at Dictionary.com |publisher=Dictionary.reference.com |date= |accessdate=2015-07-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another dictionary defines the term as "offensive slang" referring to a "...white person, usually a teenager or young adult, who adopts the fashions, the tastes, and often the mannerisms considered typical of urban black youth."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thefreedictionary.com/wigger |title=wigger - definition of wigger by The Free Dictionary |publisher=Thefreedictionary.com |date= |accessdate=2015-07-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The term may be considered derogatory, reflecting stereotypes of [[African American|African-American]], [[black British]] and white culture (when used as synonym of [[white trash]]).  The ''wannabe'' connotation may be used pejoratively, implying a failed attempt at [[cultural appropriation]] by a white person.  It is also sometimes used in a [[racist]] manner by the white culture, not only belittling the person perceived as "acting black", but also demeaning black people and culture, by proxy.  It can also be seen as exploitative by African Americans and seen as robbing black culture of the credit for the purpose of the member of the white culture to appear as innovative or edgy at the expense of black culture.

Before this modern usage developed, "wigger" meant "[[wig]]-maker", but that old usage is now obsolete.

==Phenomenon==
The phenomenon of white people adopting stereotypical black mannerisms, speech, and apparel – which in the general case is called [[allophilia]] – has appeared in several generations since slavery was abolished in the [[Western world]]. The concept has been documented in the United States, Canada, United Kingdom, Australia and other white-majority countries. An early form of this was the ''white negro'' in the [[jazz]] and [[Swing (genre)|swing music]] scenes of the 1920s and 1930s; as examined in the 1957 [[Norman Mailer]] essay "[[The White Negro]]". It was later seen in the [[zoot suit]]er of the 1930s and 1940s, the [[Hipster (1940s subculture)|hipster]] of the 1940s, the [[beatnik]] of the 1950s-1960s, the fascination with Jamaican [[ska]] and [[rude boy]] culture in Britain's 1960s [[mod subculture]], the [[blue-eyed soul]] of the 1970s ([[soul music]] sung by white singers), and the [[hip hop]] done by white rappers in the 1980s and 1990s.

Bakari Kitwana, "...a culture critic who's been tracking American hip hop for years..." has written ''Why White Kids Love Hip Hop: Wankstas, Wiggers, Wannabes, and the New Reality of Race in America.''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Kitwana |first=Bakari |url=https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=4773208 |title='Why White Kids Love Hip Hop' |publisher=Npr.org |date= |accessdate=2015-07-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1993, an article in the UK newspaper ''The Independent'' described the phenomenon of white, middle-class kids who were "wannabe Blacks".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author= |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/wiggers-just-wannabe-black-white-middleclass-kids-are-adopting-black-street-style-and-chilling-out-to-rap-music-david-usborne-reports-from-washington-1462591.html |title=Wiggers just wannabe black: White middle-class kids are adopting black street style and chilling out to rap music. |publisher=Independent.co.uk |date=1993-08-22 |accessdate=2015-07-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The African-American hip hop artist [[Azealia Banks]] has criticized white rapper [[Iggy Azalea]] "..for failing to comment on "black issues" despite capitalising on the appropriation of African American culture in her music."&lt;ref name="Tan"&gt;{{cite web |last1=Tan |first1=Monica |title=Azealia Banks's Twitter beef with Iggy Azalea over US race issues misses point {{!}} Monica Tan |url=https://www.theguardian.com/music/2014/dec/05/azealia-bankss-beef-with-wigger-iggy-azalea-over-us-race-issues-misses-point |website=the Guardian |accessdate=19 November 2018 |language=en |date=5 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Banks has called Azalea a "wigger" and there have been "...accusations of racism against Azalea" focused on her "...insensitivity to the complexities of [[race relations]] and [[cultural appropriation]]."&lt;ref name="Tan"/&gt;

Robert A. Clift's documentary, "Blacking Up: Hip-Hop's Remix of Race and Identity," questions white enthusiasts of black hip-hop culture. The [[term of art]] "wigger" "...is used both proudly and derisively to describe white enthusiasts of black hip-hop culture."&lt;ref name="Stuever"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Stuever |first1=Hank |title='Blacking Up' documentary questions white enthusiasts of black hip-hop culture |journal=The Washington Post |date=30 January 2010 |url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2010/01/29/AR2010012904040.html |accessdate=19 November 2018 |issn=0190-8286}}&lt;/ref&gt; Clift's documentary examines "...racial and cultural ownership and authenticity -- a path that begins with the stolen blackness seen in the success of [[Stephen Foster]], [[Al Jolson]], [[Benny Goodman]], [[Elvis Presley]], the [[Rolling Stones]] -- all the way up to [[Vanilla Ice]] (popular music's ur-wigger) and [[Eminem]]."&lt;ref name="Stuever"/&gt;  A review of the documentary refers to the wiggers as "white [[poseur]]s."&lt;ref name="Stuever"/&gt;

One of the earliest examples of a wigger is to be found in the fictional character of Felix in [[Harry Crews]]' book [[All We Need of Hell]]. Felix is the son of white parents who, as the narrative develops, begins to adopt the mannerisms, speech, and sensibilities of a Southern Black athlete he spends time with. Although the book was published in 1987, it was actually written in the 1970s.

==Lawsuit==
A 2011 class-action lawsuit in the [[United States District Court]] for [[Minnesota]] alleged that the administration at a predominantly white high school showed a "deliberate indifference" in allowing a group of students to hold a homecoming event called "Wigger Day", including "Wigger Wednesday" and "Wangsta Day", since at least 2008. A plaintiff named Quera Pruitt sought declaratory judgment and $75,000 in punitive damages from the defendants for creating a racially hostile environment.&lt;ref name="Redwing"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.courthousenews.com/2011/08/02/Wigger.pdf|title= Pruitt v Anderson, Borgen, Red Wing Public Schools et al|publisher= courthousenews.com|accessdate=February 23, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; On July 24, 2012, the parties settled out of court, with Pruitt awarded $90,000.&lt;ref name="redwing2"&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20140309225922/http://dev1.republican-eagle.com/event/article/id/82818/publisher_ID/16/ Sarah Gorvin "Wangster Suit Settled for $90k", Red Wing Republican Eagle, 4 August 2012]&lt;/ref&gt;

The {{Nihongo|'''Ōita Prefectural Art Museum'''|大分県立美術館|Ōitakenritsu Bijutsukan}}, also known informally as '''OpAm''', is an art museum and community exhibition venue in [[Ōita Prefecture]], [[Japan]].

The museum is located in the center of the prefectural capital [[Ōita, Ōita|Ōita-shi]], a 15 minute walk north-west of [[Ōita Station]]. 

==Current facilities==
The museum was opened in April 2015. The new museum building features modern exhibition spaces, artists studios, a café and museum shop. The building was designed by [[Pritzker Architecture Prize]] winning architect [[Shigeru Ban]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Peregoy|first1=Beau|title=The Shigeru Ban–designed Oita Prefectural Art Museum Opens in Japan|url=http://www.architecturaldigest.com/story/oita-prefectural-art-museum-shigeru-ban|website=Architectural Digest|accessdate=10 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the ground level the building features fully retractable glass shutters opening the main internal exhibition space onto an adjacent public plaza. 

The building was the recipient of a [[RIBA International Award]] for excellence in 2016.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=RIBA International Prize|url=https://www.architecture.com/awards-and-competitions-landing-page/awards/riba-international-prize|website=Royal Institute of British Architects|accessdate=10 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;
