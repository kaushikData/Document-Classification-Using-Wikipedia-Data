      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5363">'''Al-Ḥujayjah''', also known as '''Safīyah bint Thaʻlabah al-Shaybānīyah''' ([[Arabic]]: صفية بنت ثعلبة الشيبانية) was a pre-Islamic poet of the [[Banū Shaybān]] tribe, noted for her work in the genre of [[taḥrīḍ]] (incitement to vengeance). Her dates of birth and death are unknown, and even her historicity is open to question. But she seems to have granted protection to [[al-Ḥurqah|al-Ḥurqah bint al-Nuʻmān]] when [[Khosrow II]] (r. 590-628) demanded her in marriage from her father [[al-Nu'man III ibn al-Mundhir]] around the beginning of the seventh century, and her surviving corpus relates to the [[Battle of Dhū-Qār]] in c. 609.&lt;ref&gt;Hamad Alajmi, 'Pre-Islamic Poetry and Speech Act Theory: Al-A`sha, Bishr ibn Abi Khazim, and al-Ḥujayjah' (unpublished Ph.D. thesis, Indiana University, 2012), p. 161 n. 1.&lt;/ref&gt; Characterised as a 'warrior diplomat', she has been read as a key figure in pre-Islamic poetry.&lt;ref&gt;Samer M. Ali, 'Medieval Court Poetry', in ''The Oxford Encyclopedia of Islam and Women'', ed. by Natana J. Delong-Bas, 2 vols (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2013), I 651-54 (at p. 653). https://www.academia.edu/5023780.&lt;/ref&gt;

As with other supposedly pre-Islamic poetry, there has been scholarly debate over whether Al-Ḥujayjah's work might actually have been fabricated later in the medieval period (even if she herself was real). It survives only in [[Bishr ibn Marwān al-Asadī|Bishr ibn Marwān al-Asadī's]] collection ''Ḥarb Banī Shaybān maʻa Kisrá Ānūshirwān'' ({{lang-ar|حرب بني شيبان مع كسرى آنوشروان}}), which identifies Al-Ḥujayjah's father as Thaʻlabah al-Shaybānī.&lt;ref&gt;Hamad Alajmi, 'Pre-Islamic Poetry and Speech Act Theory: Al-A`sha, Bishr ibn Abi Khazim, and al-Ḥujayjah' (unpublished Ph.D. thesis, Indiana University, 2012), pp. 162-63, 165.&lt;/ref&gt; It is plausible that the poetry was composed in the [[Abbasid]] period to encourage ethnic Arabs to resist the claims for parity of status within the Caliphate by Persian members, known as the [[Shu'ubiyya]] movement.&lt;ref&gt;Hamad Alajmi, 'Pre-Islamic Poetry and Speech Act Theory: Al-A`sha, Bishr ibn Abi Khazim, and al-Ḥujayjah' (unpublished Ph.D. thesis, Indiana University, 2012), pp. 195-96.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Works==

According to Hamad Alajmi, 'Al-Ḥujayjah’s poetry, in general, is similar to other female poets from the pre-Islamic period. Her poems are short and consist of one section as opposed to the standard tripartite pre-Islamic odes ... Her language is pragmatic and lacks metaphorical diction, but is rich in imperative verbs and direct language.'&lt;ref&gt;Hamad Alajmi, 'Pre-Islamic Poetry and Speech Act Theory: Al-A`sha, Bishr ibn Abi Khazim, and al-Ḥujayjah' (unpublished Ph.D. thesis, Indiana University, 2012), p. 169.&lt;/ref&gt;

An example of her poetry, as translated by Alajmi, is this incitement to her people to receive and protect al-Ḥurqah bint al-Nuʻmān:&lt;ref&gt;Hamad Alajmi, 'Pre-Islamic Poetry and Speech Act Theory: Al-A`sha, Bishr ibn Abi Khazim, and al-Ḥujayjah' (unpublished Ph.D. thesis, Indiana University, 2012), pp. 167-68.&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
1. Oh Banū Shaybān, give life to [the tradition] of protecting the neighbor for all&lt;br&gt;
The Arabs have let it die.&lt;br&gt;
2. What is your excuse? When a noble freewoman [al-Ḥurqah] has wrapped herself&lt;br&gt;
In my clothes, [she is] planted in pearls and coral.&lt;br&gt;
3. [She is] the daughter of the kings, the owners of kingdoms and high ranks,&lt;br&gt;
She wears anklets and is the best of Nuʻmān’s [family].&lt;br&gt;
4. Will you urge each other, sharpen your swords,&lt;br&gt;
Straighten your spears,&lt;br&gt;
5. And prepare your soldiers? O my people,&lt;br&gt;
Will you prepare your battle-gear?&lt;br&gt;
6. For I have granted protection to a noble woman from the people of Kisrá ,&lt;br&gt;
[To be protected] by the elders and the youths of our people.&lt;br&gt;
7. Shaybān are my people. Is there another tribe like them?&lt;br&gt;
In combat and the charging of knights?&lt;br&gt;
8. No, by the best of the clans of Rabīʻah.&lt;br&gt;
No one is like them when disasters strike.&lt;br&gt;
9. My people grant protection to the refugee, from his enemy&lt;br&gt;
And they protect my life from life’s misfortunes.&lt;br&gt;
10. The sons of my father arrive at the battlefield not fearing&lt;br&gt;
The attacks of the enemy and the assaults of the opponents.&lt;br&gt;
11. Indeed, I am Ḥujayjah [of the tribe] of Wāʼil, and with Wāʼil,&lt;br&gt;
A man pursued escapes on a mare or a stallion.&lt;br&gt;
12. O people of Shaybān, you have been victorious in the world,&lt;br&gt;
Because of your honor, favor and beneficence.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The '''Bariba people''', self designation ''Baatonu'' (plural ''Baatombu),'' are the principal inhabitants of [[Borgou Department]], [[Benin]], and cofounders of the [[Borgu|Borgu kingdom]] of what is now northeast [[Benin]] and west-central [[Nigeria]]. In Nigeria, they are found spread between western [[Kwara State]] and the Borgu section of [[Niger State]]. There are perhaps a million Bariba, 70% of them in Benin, where they are the fourth largest ethnic group and comprise approximately 1/11 of the population (9.2%).&lt;ref&gt;[[Encyclopædia Britannica]]&lt;/ref&gt; The Bariba are concentrated primarily in the north-east of the country, especially around the city of [[Nikki, Benin|Nikki]], which is considered the Bariba capital.&lt;ref name="Benin"&gt;{{cite book|last=Butler|first=Stuart|title=Benin|year=2006|pages=21|publisher=[[Bradt Travel Guides]], The Globe Pequot Press, [[Guilford, Connecticut]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; They originally migrated from the area of [[Kwara State]], Nigeria, and were renowned horsemen. One of their noted festivals is the annual [[Gani]] festival of which horseriding is a prominent element of.&lt;ref name="Benin"/&gt;

The Bariba people holds an important place in the history of the country. During the late 19th century, Bariba{{Clarify|date=October 2010}}was known to constitute independent states{{Clarify|date=October 2010}}and dominate with kingdoms{{Clarify|date=October 2010}}in cities like [[Nikki, Benin|Nikki]] and [[Kandi, Benin|Kandi]] in the northeast of the country. In the town of [[Péhunco|Pehunko]] there are approximately 200,000 Bariba people out of 365,000 inhabitants.&lt;ref name="Sargent"&gt;{{cite book|author=Sargent, Carolyn Fishel|title= The Cultural Context of Therapeutic Choice|year=1982|publisher= D. Reidel Publishing Company, [[Holland]].}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{dubious|date=October 2010}}

[[File:Guerrier bariba de Niki.jpg|thumb|left|Bariba warrior from the state of Nikki, 1900.]]

The Bariba society consists of a higher-ranking official as chief of the town and their subordinates’ chiefs. Social status and titles are inherited in families, but the status of a person may be given by the families’ nature of work.&lt;ref name="Sargent"/&gt; Notable subdivisions of the Bariba include the ruling Wasangari nobles, Baatombu commoners, slaves of varying origin, Dendi merchants, Fulbe herders, and other divisional ethnic groups.

Agriculture is the dominant occupation for the Bariba. They grow [[maize|corn]], [[sorghum]], [[rice]], [[cotton]], [[cassava]] (tapioca), [[Yam (vegetable)|yam]]s, [[bean]]s, [[palm oil]], [[peanut]]s and some poultry and livestock.&lt;ref name="Sargent"/&gt; Religion plays an important role in Bariba tribes and they are primarily [[Islam]]ic. The religion was introduced to Bariba people by Dendi traders who were preaching in the north. However a number of Bariba communities have their own indigenous beliefs.&lt;ref name="Sargent"/&gt;

==Language==
{{Main|Baatonum language}}
The [[Bariba language]] is spoken mostly in [[Borgou]], [[Alibori]] and part of [[Atacora]] in northern Benin. The [[Bariba language]] was once classified as an outlier of the [[Gur languages|Gur family]], but is now agnostically placed as an isolate within the [[Savanna languages]].
It is a [[tone language]] with [[noun class]]es. It has been written since about 1970. Transcription using the Beninese national alphabet requires, in addition to the Latin letters, the following characters from the [[International Phonetic Alphabet|IPA]]:

:{{IPAblink|ɔ}} "open o"
:{{IPAblink|ɛ}} "open e"
:the [[nasal vowel]]s {{IPA|[ã ɛ̃ ɔ̃ ĩ ũ]}}.

'''Bohemian Romani''' or ''Bohemian Romany'' is a dialect of [[Romani language|Romani]] (a European [[Indo-Aryan language]]) formerly spoken by the [[Romani people]] of [[Bohemia]], the western part of today's [[Czech Republic]]. It became extinct after [[World War II]], due to extermination of most of its speakers in [[Nazism|Nazi]] [[concentration camps]].

== Speakers ==
Before their extermination in the 1940s, speakers of Bohemian Romani, the Bohemian Romanies, were one of several [[nomadic]] populations of Bohemia. They led a peripatetic (or semi-peripatetic) way of life, travelling around the country (especially during the warmer seasons of the year) and offering their services to the sedentary population of the Bohemian countryside. They were mostly horse-dealers, peddlars, tinners, and entertainers.

The first ancestors of Bohemian Romanies probably arrived in Bohemia in the 16th and 17th centuries, from [[Slovakia]] via [[Moravia]]. Small-scale migration of Romanies from Slovakia to the Czech Lands (as well as backwards) continued throughout the following centuries. The Bohemian Romanies have always been a numerically insignificant minority. In 1939, there were ca. 6,000 people of different Romani groups in the territory of today's Czech Republic (Nečas 1995). Of these, a smaller fraction, perhaps some 2,000 people, lived in Bohemia. The proportion of different Romani groups in this figure is unknown, though the estimate of 500-1,500 of Bohemian Romanies cannot be wildly off the mark.

Other Romani groups in Bohemia, who spoke different dialects of Romani than the Bohemian Romani, included the [[Sinti]] and a few families of the [[Kalderar]] (or [[Kalderaš]]) Roma. The Sinti appear to have been the first Romani group to be established in the region, some of them arriving from southeastern Europe as early as in the 15th century; they mostly inhabited the [[German language|German]]-speaking parts of Bohemia. The Kalderar, on the other hand, were relatively late newcomers, having had migrated from [[Wallachia]] in the second half of the 19th century. In addition, there were also several non-Romani peripatetic groups in Bohemia, who spoke Czech or German or [[argot]]s based on these languages.

The self-[[ethnonym]] of Bohemian Romanies was simply ''Rom'' (plural ''Roma''). They were called "Hungarians" by the Sinti; this probably reflects their origin in Slovakia, which was then part of Hungary. They were called "Poles" (''Poljako'', plural ''Poljača'') by the [[Kalderash]], which is one of the ethnonyms the Kalderar use to refer to different Romani groups. The sedentary population referred to all peripatetic groups, including Bohemian Roma, as "gypsies": ''cikáni'' in Czech or ''Zigeuner'' in German.

In the early 20th century, Bohemian Romani was, at least in some groups of Bohemian Roma, gradually becoming a non-native ethnic language, acquired in late childhood and used mostly for secretive purposes (cf. Lesný 1916: 214–216, Lípa 1960: 50). Clearly, a development had started toward a [[Para-Romani]] variety, that is, a specialized non-native variety spoken by Roma, which has the grammar of a majority language (Czech in this case) as well as an access to Romani-derived lexicon (Elšík 2003: 44).

The Nazi genocide of Roma and Sinti in the 1940s brought about radical death of all Romani dialects of pre-war Bohemia, including Bohemian Romani. Only ca. 600 (i.e. 10% of) Czech Roma and Sinti survived the genocide (Nečas 1995), including perhaps a hundred of Bohemian Roma. Bohemian Romani ceased to be used by the survivors due to a complete social disintegration of their communities, and they ceased to transmit the language to their children. The last known speaker of Bohemian Romani died in the 1970s (Hana Šebková, p.c.).

The historical group of Bohemian Romanies must be distinguished from those Romanies groups that live in Bohemia presently. The latter are post-World War II immigrants from [[Slovakia]] (especially [[Romungro]]), who do not speak Bohemian Romani.

== Dialect classification ==
Bohemian Romani belongs to the [[North Central Romani|North Central]] dialect group of Romani. It is most closely related to [[Moravian Romani]] and [[West Slovak Romani]], together with which it forms the Western subgroup of North Central Romani. Although clearly a North Central dialect, Bohemian Romani also shares a few features with the [[Sinti Romani|Sinti]] dialects of Romani. In some cases, these are due to diffusion from Sinti into Bohemian Romani. While Bohemian Romani would have been intelligible to speakers of other North Central dialects, there is evidence that there was no inherent intelligibility between Bohemian Romani and Sinti.

== Lexicon ==
Bohemian Romani shares with other dialects of Romani much of its [[Indo-Aryan languages|Indo-Aryan]] vocabulary as well as numerous early loanwords from Western [[Iranian languages]] ([[Persian language|Persian]] and/or [[Kurdish language|Kurdish]]), [[Armenian language|Armenian]], [[Ossetic language|Ossetic]], and [[Greek language|Greek]]. In addition, it shares with the other North Central dialects of Romani the layer of loanwords from [[South Slavic languages]], [[Hungarian language|Hungarian]], and [[Slovak language|Slovak]]. Finally, the most recent loanwords originate in [[Czech language|Czech]].

Examples of loanwords
* West Iranian: ''angrusťi'' "ring", ''baxt'' "luck", ''čupňi(k)'' "whip"
* Armenian: ''burnek'' "handful", ''grast'' "horse"
* West Iranian or Armenian: ''čekat'' "forehead"
* Ossetic: ''círax'' "shoe, boot", ''xólov'' "trousers"
* Greek: ''amoňis'' "anvil", ''armin'' "cabbage", ''efta'' "seven", ''foros'' "town", ''ľiťhi'' "fruit tree", ''paxoň-'' "freeze"
* South Slavic: ''caklo'' "glass", ''doha'' "enough", ''dugo'' "long", ''duma'' "speech", ''vičin-'' "shout"
* Hungarian: ''bugaris'' "spider" (&lt; "beetle"), ''dilos'' "noon", ''faďin-'' "freeze"
* Slovak: ''čapláris'' "inn keeper"
* Czech: ''mořos'' "sea"
* Slovak or Czech: ''hrobos'' "grave", ''národos'' "friend" (&lt; "nation")


''Ehas jekh čorro rom. Kerelas buťi. Kana kerelas, kerďas dešupandž karfa, the diňas len peskra romňake, kaj te džal jarreske. Kana vaš oda jarro geľas, avľas, thoďas, ušanďas xumer.

'''Broadcast automation''' incorporates the use of [[broadcast programming]] technology to [[automate]] [[broadcasting]] operations.  Used either at a [[broadcast network]], [[radio station]] or a [[television station]], it can run a facility in the absence of a human [[Operator (profession)|operator]].  They can also run in a "live assist" mode when there are on-air personnel present at the [[master control]], [[television studio]] or [[control room]].

The [[radio transmitter]] end of the [[airchain]] is handled by a separate [[automatic transmission system]] (ATS).

==History==
Originally, in the USA, many (if not most) [[broadcast license|broadcast licensing]] authorities required a licensed [[board operator]] to run every station at all times, meaning that every [[DJ]] had to pass an exam to obtain a license to be on-air, if their duties also required them to ensure proper operation of the transmitter.  This was often the case on overnight and weekend [[shift work|shift]]s when there was no [[broadcast engineer]] present, and all of the time for small stations with only a contract engineer on call.

In the U.S., it was also necessary to have an operator on duty at all times in case the [[Emergency Broadcast System]] (EBS) was used, as this had to be triggered manually.  While there has not been a requirement to relay any other [[Warning system|warning]]s, any mandatory messages from the U.S. president would have had to first be [[Authentication|authenticated]] with a [[code word]] sealed in a pink envelope sent annually to stations by the [[Federal Communications Commission]] (FCC).

Gradually, the quality and reliability of electronic equipment improved, regulations were relaxed, and no operator had to be present (or even available) while a station was operating.  In the U.S., this came about when the [[Emergency Alert System|EAS]] replaced the EBS, starting the movement toward automation to assist, and sometimes take the place of, the live [[disc jockey]]s (DJs) and [[radio personalities]].

==Early analog systems==
[[Image:WWJQAutomation.jpg|right|thumb|Harris automation system used at the former WWJQ (now [[WPNW]]) in 1993.]]
Early automation systems were [[electromechanical]] systems which used [[Repeater|relay]]s.  Later systems were "computerized" only to the point of maintaining a schedule, and were limited to radio rather than TV.  Music would be stored on [[reel-to-reel audio tape recording|reel-to-reel]] audio tape.  [[Subaudible tone]]s on the tape marked the end of each song.  The computer would simply rotate among the tape players until the computer's internal clock matched that of a scheduled event.  When a scheduled event would be encountered, the computer would finish the currently-playing song and then execute the scheduled block of events.  These events were usually [[Radio advertising|advertisements]], but could also include the station's top-of-hour [[station identification]], news, or a [[commercial bumper|bumper]] promoting the station or its other shows.  At the end of the block, the rotation among tapes resumed.

Advertisements, [[jingle]]s, and the top-of-hour station identification required by law were often on "carts".  Short for cartridges, these were endless tapes similar to [[Stereo-Pak|4-track tapes]], were mechanically identical as well, and were called [[Fidelipac]]s. The primary difference between carts and 4 track is two fold. The Cart had only two tracks and the 4-track (obviously) had four. The Cart ran at 7 and 1/2 [[Inch_per_second|IPS]] whereas the 4-Track ran at 3 and 3/4 IPS.  Carts had a slot for a pinch roller&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Wikimedia|first1=Commons|title=Cartridge Picture|url=https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:NAB-cartridge.jpg|website=Wikimedia Commons|publisher=Wikimedia|accessdate=25 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; on a spindle which was activated by solenoid upon pressing the start button on the cart machine.  The [[Tape_transport#Capstan|capstan]] was spinning at full speed and this allowed for nearly instantaneous playback start without artifacts.   Mechanical [[carousel]]s would rotate the carts in and out of multiple [[cassette deck|tape players]] as dictated by the computer.  Time announcements were provided by a pair of dedicated cart players, with the even minutes stored on one and the odd minutes on the other.  This meant an announcement would always be ready to play, even if the minute was changing when the announcement was triggered.  The system did require attention throughout the day to change reels as they ran out and reload carts.  It became obsolete when a method was developed to automatically rewind and re-cue the reel tapes when they ran out, extending 'walk-away' time indefinitely.

Radio station [[WSJM-FM|WIRX]] may have been one of the world's first completely automated radio stations, built and designed by Brian Jeffrey Brown in 1963 when Brown was only 10 years old.{{Citation needed|date=July 2011}}  The station broadcast in a classical format, called "More Good Music (MGM)" and featured five-minute bottom-of-the-hour news feeds from the [[Mutual Broadcasting System]].  The heart of the automation was an 8 x 24 telephone [[Stepping switch|stepping relay]] which controlled two reel-to-reel tape decks, one twelve inch [[Ampex]] machine providing the main program audio and a second [[RCA]] seven inch machine providing "fill" music.  The tapes played by these machines were originally produced in the [[Mid-West_Family_Broadcasting|Midwest Family Broadcasting]] (MWF) Madison, Wisconsin production facility by WSJM Chief Engineer Richard E. McLemore (and later in-house at WSJM) with sub-audible tones used to signal the end of a song.  The stepping relay was programmed by slide switches in the front of the two relay racks which housed the equipment.  The news feeds were triggered by a [[microswitch]] which was attached to a [[Western Union]] clock and tripped by the minute hand of the clock. and then reset the stepping relay.  Originally, 30-minute station identification was accomplished by a [[simulcast]] switch in the control booth for sister station [[WSJM (AM)]], whereupon the disc jockey in the booth would announce "This is WSJM-AM and... (then pressing the momentary contact button) ...WSJM-FM, St. Joseph, Michigan."  This only lasted about six months, however, and a standard tape cartridge player was wired in to announce the station identification and triggered by the Western Union clock.

[[Image:OpenReel-GMS204.jpg|size200px|thumb|Solidyne GMS200 tape recorder with computer self-adjustment. Argentina 1980-1990]]
A different technology appeared in 1980 with the analog recorders made by Solidyne, which used a computer-controlled tape positioning system.  Four GMS 204 units were controlled from a 6809 [[microprocessor]], with the program stored in a [[Solid-state drive|solid-state]] plug-in [[memory module (disambiguation)|memory module]]. This system has a limited programming time of about eight hours.

Satellite programming often used audible [[dual-tone multi-frequency]] (DTMF) signals to trigger events at [[Network affiliate|affiliate]] stations.  This allowed the automatic local insertion of ads and station IDs.  Because there are 12 (or 16) tone pairs, and typically four tones were sent in rapid succession (less than one second), more events could be triggered than by sub-audible tones (usually 25&amp;nbsp;Hz and 35&amp;nbsp;Hz).

==Modern digital systems==

Modern systems run on [[hard disk]], where all of the music, jingles, advertisements, [[voice track]]s, and other announcements are stored.  These audio files may be either [[data compression|compressed]] or uncompressed, or often with only minimal compression as a compromise between file size and quality.  For [[radio software]], these disks are usually in computers, sometimes running their own custom [[operating system]]s, but more often running as an [[Application software|application]] on a PC operating system.
 
[[Scheduling (broadcasting)|Scheduling]] was an important advance of these systems, allowing for exact timing.  Some systems use [[GPS]] satellite [[receiver (radio)|receivers]] to obtain exact [[atomic time]], for perfect [[synchronization]] with satellite-delivered [[radio programming|programming]].  Reasonably-accurate timekeeping can also be obtained with the use of [[Internet protocol]]s (IP) like [[Network Time Protocol]] (NTP).

Automation systems are also more interactive than ever before with [[digital audio workstation]] (DAW) with [[console automation]] and can even record from a [[telephone hybrid]] to play back an edited conversation with a telephone caller.  This is part of a system's live-assist mode.

The use of automation software and [[voice track]]s to replace live DJs is a current trend in radio broadcasting, done by many [[Internet radio]] and [[adult hits]] stations.  Stations can even be voice-tracked from another city far away, now often delivering sound files over the Internet.  In the U.S., this is a common practice under controversy for making radio more generic and artificial.  Having local content is also touted as a way for traditional stations to compete with [[satellite radio]], where there may be no [[radio personality]] on the air at all.

[[Image:Placa-audioPC-925.jpg|size100px|left|thumb|Solidyne 922: The first bit compression card for PC, 1990]]
A commercially available, for-sale product named [[Audicom]] was introduced by Oscar Bonello in 1989.&lt;ref name="solidyne1"&gt;[http://www.lanacion.com.ar/Archivo/Nota.asp?nota_id=187775 LA NACION newspaper article about development of bit compression technology, Buenos Aires, February 5th, 2001]&lt;/ref&gt; It is based on [[Audio compression (data)|psychoacoustic lossy compression]], the same principle being used in most modern lossy audio encoders such as [[MP3]] and [[Advanced Audio Coding]] (AAC), and it allowed both broadcast automation and recording to [[hard drives]].&lt;ref name="solidyne2"&gt;[http://www.aes.org/e-lib/browse.cfm?elib=2384 New Improvements in Audio Signal Processing for AM Broadcasting by Bonello, Oscar]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="solidyne3"&gt;[http://www.aes.org/e-lib/browse.cfm?elib=6674 PC-Controlled Psychoacoustic Audio Processor by Bonello, Oscar Juan]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Television===
In television, [[playout]] [[automation]] is also becoming more practical as the storage space of [[hard drive]]s increases. [[Television shows]] and [[television commercials]], as well as [[digital on-screen graphic]]s (DOG or BUG), can all be stored on [[video server]]s remotely controlled by computers utilizing the [[9-Pin Protocol]] and the [[Video Disk Control Protocol]] (VDCP).  These systems can be very extensive, tied-in with parts that allow the "ingest" (as it is called in the industry) of video from satellite networks and [[electronic news gathering]] (ENG) operations and management of the video library, including archival of [[footage]] for later use.  In [[ATSC]], [[Programming Metadata Communication Protocol]] (PMCP) is then used to pass information about the video through the airchain to [[Program and System Information Protocol]] (PSIP), which transmits the current [[electronic program guide]] (EPG) information over digital television to the viewer.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5134">"'''Choate'''", as used in [[American law]], means "completed or perfected in and of itself",&lt;ref&gt;Ben Zimmer, James B. Levy, and Debra Cassens Weiss, ''op. cit.'', all separately citing [http://www.yourdictionary.com/law/choate ''Webster's New World Dictionary'' online].  Accessed January 14, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; or "perfected, complete, or certain".&lt;ref name=Free&gt;[http://legal-dictionary.thefreedictionary.com/Choate Choate at the Free Legal Dictionary website]. Accessed January 14, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; It is a controversial word due to its [[etymology]] as a [[back-formation]] from the old and well-established word "[[wikt:inchoate|inchoate]]" that dates from 1534,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/inchoate  Merriam-Webster Dictionary listing for '''''inchoate''''']&lt;/ref&gt; meaning "in process of formation". Because the prefix "[[wikt:in-|in-]]", meaning "not", frequently is used to create antonyms, superficially the relationship of the two words seems to make sense, however, the [[Latin language|Latin]] origin of "inchoate", the verb ''{{Lang-la|incohare}}'', begins with a different use of the prefix "in-", wherein the prefix denotes "within".&lt;ref name=Zimmer&gt;Ben Zimmer, [https://www.nytimes.com/2010/01/03/magazine/03FOB-onlanguage-t.html "On Language: Choate: Why does Justice Antonin Scalia hate this word?"] ''[[The New York Times Magazine]]'' Sunday, December 31, 2009.  Accessed January 14, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; Hence, "inchoate" was not derived from "choate", but the reverse has occurred with apparent misunderstanding of the Latin source, leading to its being challenged as an incongruent word.

==Etymology==
The word became the subject of many discussions after [[United States Supreme Court]] associate justice [[Antonin Scalia]] admonished an attorney for using the word during [[oral argument]] at the high court as if it were an antonym of "inchoate", relating that the word did not exist.&lt;ref name=Levy&gt;James B. Levy, "Justice Scalia admonishes lawyer: 'Choate ain't a word'", Legal Writing Prof Blog, January 13, 2010, found at [http://lawprofessors.typepad.com/legalwriting/2010/01/justice-scalia-admonishes-lawyer-choate-aint-a-word.html Law Professors blog and website]. Accessed January 14, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Weiss&gt;Debra Cassens Weiss, "U.S. Supreme Court: Law Dictionaries Accept 'Choate,' Although Scalia Has Long Disagreed", January 4, 2010, ''[[ABA Journal]]'', found at [http://www.abajournal.com/news/article/law_dictionaries_accept_choate_although_scalia_has_long_disagreed ABA Journal online]. Accessed January 14, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Merriam-Webster Dictionary]] does not list the controversial word other than as a biographical reference to a surname (Rufus Choate 1799–1859, an American jurist) and to an educational institution bearing that proper [[Choate Rosemary Hall|name]] from its founders.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/choate  Merriam-Webster Dictionary listing for '''''Choate''''']&lt;/ref&gt;

[[United States|American]] [[linguist]] and [[lexicographer]] [[Benjamin Zimmer|Ben Zimmer]] argues that, although faulty, its use among [[lawyer]]s has been documented since at least 1828, and it was used by [[Oliver Wendell Holmes, Jr.]], among other legal luminaries of the 20th century.&lt;ref name=Zimmer /&gt; It is included in most legal dictionaries and lexicons;&lt;ref name=Free /&gt;&lt;ref name=Zimmer /&gt;  however, ''[[Black's Law Dictionary]]'' editor-in-chief Bryan Garner essentially agrees with Scalia.&lt;ref name=Levy /&gt;&lt;ref name=Weiss /&gt; Nonetheless, Garner admits its common acceptance and use within the legal profession.&lt;ref name=Weiss /&gt;  In ''[[IRS v. McDermott]]'', 507 U.S. 447 (1993), Scalia quoted a 1954 [[precedent]], "but substituted ''[no longer inchoate]'' for choate".&lt;ref name=Zimmer /&gt;&lt;ref name=Weiss /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''[[IRS v. McDermott]]'', 507 U.S. 447 (1993) found at [http://supreme.justia.com/us/507/447/ Justia.com website].  Accessed January 14, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

"No longer inchoate" is a phrase used in other contexts as well to convey a more exact meaning.&lt;ref name=Ghits&gt;[http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;q=%22no+longer+inchoate%22&amp;aq=f&amp;oq=&amp;aqi= Google.com search results for "no longer inchoate"].  Accessed January 14, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; Antonyms listed by the ''[[Merriam-Webster Dictionary]]'' for "inchoate" are "adult", "full-blown", "full-fledged", "mature", "ripe", and "ripened".

"Choate" has been used in several legal contexts, for example, any "choate right is an undefeatable right that is totally valid and ... totally free from encumbrances",&lt;ref name=Free /&gt; and a "choate lien is ... certain and definite".&lt;ref name=Free /&gt; Such a lien is a [[Perfection (law)|perfected]] [[security interest]] as used in the U.S. Federal [[Title 11 of the United States Code|Bankruptcy Code]] and [[Uniform Commercial Code]]. In the context of reference to [[lien]]s, rights in [[Equity (law)|equity]], and [[Inchoate offense|inchoate crimes]],&lt;ref name=Free /&gt; it has been used as the [[antonym]] of [[inchoate]].&lt;ref name=Zimmer /&gt;

[[File:StrappedCurrency.jpg|thumb|A stack of [[United States one hundred-dollar bill|$100 Federal Reserve Notes]] in $10,000 straps. Note the ABA compliant mustard color.]]
A '''currency strap''', also known as '''currency band''' or '''bill strap''' is a simple paper device designed to hold a specific denomination and number of [[banknotes]].  It can also refer to the bundle itself.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1&gt;[http://www.philadelphiafed.org/education/resources/history-of-currency-counting/#1960s/70s History of Currency Counting at the Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

In the United States, the [[American Bankers Association]] (ABA) has a standard for both value and color, as shown below.  Note that all bills greater than $1 only come in straps of 100 count.  The colors allow for quick accounting, even when the bills are stacked, such as in a [[Bank vault|vault]]. Special striped bands are used for straps containing only [[Replacement banknote|star notes]].

==History==
Bundling money together with a simple elastic or paper device is as old as paper currency itself.  However, measured and standardized straps are a relatively new idea.  For example, until the mid-1970s, The US Federal Reserve counted bills by hand.  That is, they employed 55 currency counters whose job it was to count as well as, by touch and feel, authenticate bills.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt; However, as the amount of currency in circulation increased, they found that they needed a more efficient way to count currency.  To help the Currency Counting staff keep up, the Bank began strap-sorting the $1 to $20 notes. Straps were visually inspected and weighed against a counterweight equal to the paper mass of 100 genuine U.S. notes.

{{Politics of the European Union}}
The notion of a '''democratic deficit within the [[European Union]] (EU)''' is the idea that the governance of the EU lacks [[democratic legitimacy]].  This led in part to an elected [[European Parliament]] being created in 1979 and given the power to approve or reject [[EU legislation]]. Since then, usage of the term has broadened to describe newer issues facing the European Union. However voter turnout has fallen consecutively at [[Elections to the European Parliament|the seven elections]] since the first election in 1979 and voter turnout in the [[European Parliament election, 2014|2014 election]] stood at 42.54% of all European voters. This is the lowest of any [[General election|national election]] in the [[Member state of the European Union|28 countries of the European Union]] where turnout at national elections averages 68% across the EU.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Voter turnout in national and EU parliamentary elections |url=http://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/tgm/table.do?tab=table&amp;init=1&amp;language=en&amp;pcode=tsdgo310&amp;plugin=1 |work=Eurostat |accessdate=29 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Opinions differ as to whether the EU has a [[democratic deficit]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.princeton.edu/~amoravcs/library/myth_european.pdf |title=The Myth of Europe's Democratic Deficit |publisher=Princeton University |format=PDF |date= |accessdate=10 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; or how it should be remedied if it exists.&lt;ref name="BVerfG-2009" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Pernice-2004a" /&gt; [[Pro-Europeanism|Pro-Europeans]] (i.e. those in favour of the EU) argue that the European Union should reform its institutions to make them more [[Accountability|accountable]], while [[Euroscepticism|Eurosceptics]] argue that the EU should reduce its powers and often campaign for [[withdrawal from the EU]].

==Use and meaning of the term==
The phrase "democratic deficit" is cited as having first been used in 1977 by the [[Young European Federalists]] in their Manifesto,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.federalunion.org.uk/the-first-use-of-the-term-democratic-deficit/ first use of the term “democratic deficit” BY RICHARD – 10/10/1977 POSTED IN: ARCHIVES] ''Political Union''.&lt;/ref&gt; which was drafted by [[Richard Corbett]]. In 1979 it was used by [[David Marquand]] in reference to the then [[European Economic Community]], the forerunner of the [[European Union]]. He argued that the European Parliament (then the Assembly) suffered from a democratic deficit as it was not directly elected by the citizens of the Community.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Marquand|first=David|authorlink=David Marquand|title=Parliament for Europe|year=1979|publisher=Cape|isbn=978-0-224-01716-9 |page = 64|quote=The resulting 'democratic deficit' would not be acceptable in a Community committed to democratic principles.}}&lt;br/&gt;

===Constitutional nature of the democratic deficit===
In the European Union, there are two sources of democratic legitimacy: the European Parliament, chosen by the electorates of the individual EU countries; and the [[Council of the European Union]] (the "Council of Ministers"), together with the [[European Council]] (of heads of national governments), that represent the peoples of the individual states. The [[European Commission]] (the executive branch of the Union) is appointed by the two bodies acting together. Democratic legitimacy within the EU can be compared with the dual legitimacy provided for in a federal polity, such as the [[United States of America|USA]], where there are two independent sources of democratic legitimacy, the [[United States House of Representatives|House of Representatives]] and the [[United States Senate|Senate]], and, to become law, decisions must be approved both by one institution representing the people as a whole and by a separate body representing the peoples of the individual states.&lt;ref&gt; {{cite book | last1 = Schütze | first1 = Robert | year = 2012 | title = European Constitutional Law | location = Cambridge | publisher = Cambridge University Press | pages = 74–77 | isbn = 9780521732758 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Federal Constitutional Court of Germany|German Constitutional Court]] referred to a "structural democratic deficit" inherent in the construction of the European Union.&lt;ref name="BVerfG-2009"/&gt; It found that the decision-making processes in the EU remained largely those of an international organisation, which would ordinarily be based on the principle of the equality of states and that the principle of equality of states and the principle of equality of citizens cannot be reconciled in a ''[[Staatenverbund]]''.&lt;ref name="BVerfG-2009"&gt;{{cite press release | publisher = German Federal Constitutional Court – Press office | date = 30 June 2009| title = Press release no. 72/2009. Judgment of 30 June 2009 | url = https://www.bundesverfassungsgericht.de/SharedDocs/Pressemitteilungen/EN/2009/bvg09-072.html | accessdate = 6 August 2009 | quote = The extent of the Union's freedom of action has steadily and considerably increased, not least by the Treaty of Lisbon, so that meanwhile in some fields of policy, the European Union has a shape that corresponds to that of a federal state, i.e. is analogous to that of a state. In contrast, the internal decision-making and appointment procedures remain predominantly committed to the pattern of an international organisation, i.e. are analogous to international law; as before, the structure of the European Union essentially follows the principle of the equality of states. [. . .] Due to this structural democratic deficit, which cannot be resolved in a Staatenverbund, further steps of integration that go beyond the status quo may undermine neither the States’ political power of action nor the principle of conferral. The peoples of the Member States are the holders of the constituent power. [. . .] The constitutional identity is an inalienable element of the democratic self-determination of a people. }}&lt;/ref&gt; In other words, in a supranational union or confederation (which is not a federal state) there is a problem of how to reconcile the principle of equality ''among'' nation states, which applies to [[International organizations|international (intergovernmental) organisations]], and the principle of equality among citizens, which applies ''within'' [[State (polity)|state]]s.&lt;ref name="Pernice-2004a"&gt;{{cite book | last = Pernice | first = Ingolf | editor=George A. Bermann and Katharina Pistor|author2=Katharina Pistor  | title = Law and governance in an enlarged European Union: essays in European law | year = 2004 |chapter=Institutional settlements for an enlarged European Union| publisher = Hart Publishing  | isbn =978-1-84113-426-0 | pages = 3–38  | quote =Among the most difficult challenges has been reconciling the two faces of equality – equality of states versus equality of citizens.

However, the Union is of a different nature, having developed into a fully fledged 'supranational Union', a polity ''sui generis''. But to the extent that such a polity is based upon the will of, and is constituted by, its citizens, democratic principles require that all citizens have equal rights.  }}&lt;/ref&gt; A 2014 report from the British [[Electoral Reform Society]] wrote that "[t]his unique institutional structure makes it difficult to apply the usual democratic standards without significant changes of emphasis. Certainly, the principles of representativeness, accountability and democratic engagement are vital, but the protection of the rights of minorities is perhaps especially important. The EU is a political regime that is, in one sense at least, entirely made up of minorities."&lt;ref name="ERS"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.electoral-reform.org.uk/images/dynamicImages/file/Close%20the%20Gap%20FOR%20ONLINE%204.pdf |title=Electoral Reform Society — Close the Gap — Tackling Europe's democratic deficit. |format=PDF |date= |accessdate=10 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===European Commission===
One assertion of democratic illegitimacy focuses on the role of the [[European Commission]] in initiating legislation. This criticism has, in turn, been criticised, using comparisons with the situation in national governments where few members' bills are ever debated and "fewer than 15% are ever successfully adopted in any form", while government proposals "generally pass without substantial or substantive amendments from the legislature".&lt;ref name="Kreppel" /&gt;  The Commission is reestablished every five years. Individual members of the incoming Commission are nominated by national governments and the proposed Commission is ([[Barroso Commission#Commissionerhearings|or is not]]) approved jointly and severally by the [[Council of the European Union]] and the European Parliament.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ec.europa.eu/about/index_en.htm |title=Organisational structure |publisher=European Commission |date= |accessdate=10 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; If Parliament passes a vote of censure, the Commission must resign.&lt;ref&gt; {{cite book | last1 = Schütze | first1 = Robert | year = 2012 | title = European Constitutional Law |publisher = Cambridge University Press | page = 100 | isbn = 9780521732758 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Such a censure motion has been brought eight times times, but never passed.&lt;ref&gt; {{cite web |url=http://www.europarl.europa.eu/about-parliament/en/powers-and-procedures/supervisory-powers  |access-date=28 October 2018 | title =About Parliament: Supervisory Powers | publisher = European Commission}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1999, an initial censure motion against the [[Santer Commission]] was defeated, awaiting the results of an investigation. When the results of the investigation were published, the Santer Commission resigned, forestalling a second censure motion that was expected to pass with a large majority.&lt;ref&gt; {{cite book |edition=2nd| last1 = Nugent | first1 = Neill | last2 = Rhinard | first2 = Mark | year = 2015 | title = The European Commission| page = 54 | isbn = 978-0-230-22059-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to [[R. Daniel Kelemen]], fragmented power systems like the European Union and the United States may tend to produce more detailed regulations that give member states less discretion in implementation.&lt;ref name=" Kelemen "&gt;{{cite book| last  = Kelemen | first   = R. Daniel| title   = The Rules of Federalism: Institutions and Regulatory Politics in the EU and Beyond | year    = 2012| publisher  = Harvard University Press| isbn = 978-0-674-01309-4| pages = 21–22 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In an attempt to strengthen democratic legitimacy, the [[Treaty of Lisbon]] provided that the nomination of the [[President of the European Commission]] should "take account" of the result of the European parliamentary elections, interpreted by the larger parliamentary groups to mean that the European Council should nominate the candidate (''Spitzenkandidat'') proposed by the dominant parliamentary group. However, this has also been criticized from the point of view of democratic legitimacy on the grounds that the European Union is not a country and the European Commission is not a government, also having a semi-judicial role that requires it to act as a "referee" or "policeman" rather than a partisan actor. The fear is that a "semi-elected" Commission president might be "too partisan to retain the trust of national leaders; too powerless to win the loyalty of citizens". This, too, is seen as a possibly insoluble problem resulting from the European's dual nature, partly an international organization and partly a federation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.economist.com/news/europe/21588381-seeking-confront-rise-eurosceptics-and-fill-democratic-deficit-democratic|work = [[The Economist]]|title=A democratic nightmare: Seeking to confront the rise of Eurosceptics and fill the democratic deficit|accessdate=3 October 2014|date= October 26, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Electoral Reform Society observed polling evidence from Germany which showed that support for the [[CDU/CSU]] ([[European People's Party|EPP]] group) ahead of the [[European Parliament election, 2014 (Germany)|2014 European Parliament elections]] was higher than support for the [[Social Democratic Party (Germany)|Social Democrats]] ([[Progressive Alliance of Socialists and Democrats|S&amp;D]] group) and that there was little difference between their support in the opinion polls for national and European Parliament elections. This was despite another poll showing that S&amp;D candidate [[Martin Schulz]] was more popular among German voters than EPP candidate [[Jean-Claude Juncker]]. They concluded that "this does not suggest that the majority of German voters are treating the contest as a chance to choose a Commission President."  However, they recommended that the candidate model be kept with "a clearer set of rules for future elections."&lt;ref name="ERS"/&gt;

===European Parliament===
One assertion of democratic illegitimacy focuses on the alleged weakness of the [[European Parliament]].{{cn|date=March 2016}} This has been countered by a number of political scientists, who have compared the systems of governance in the European Union with that of the United States, and stated that the alleged powerless or dysfunctional nature of the European Parliament is now a "myth".&lt;ref name="Kreppel" /&gt; It is argued that there are important differences from national European parliaments, such as the role of committees, [[bipartisan]] voting, decentralized political parties, executive-[[legislative]] divide and absence of Government-opposition divide. All these traits are considered as signs of weakness or unaccountability, but as these very same traits are found in the [[US House of Representatives]] to a lesser or greater degree, the European Parliament is more appropriately compared with the US House of Representatives.&lt;ref name="Kreppel"&gt;{{cite web|first= Amie|last= Kreppel|title = Understanding the European Parliament from a Federalist Perspective: The Legislatures of the USA and EU Compared|publisher=Center for European Studies, [[University of Florida]]|year=2006|url=http://web.clas.ufl.edu/users/kreppel/COMFEDFINAL.pdf|accessdate = 26 September 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; In that sense, it is now a powerful parliament, as it is not controlled by a "governing majority": Majorities have to be built afresh for each item of legislation by explanation, persuasion and negotiation.

Legislative initiative in the EU rests almost entirely with the Commission, while in member states it is shared between parliament and executive. However, in national parliaments less than 15% of legislative initiatives from individual members of parliament become law in any form when they do not have the backing of the executive, while most proposals by the executive are passed without major amendments in parliament. The European Parliament, on the other hand, can only propose amendments, but these proposals are successful in more than 80% of cases, and even in controversial proposals, the success rate is almost 30%.&lt;ref name="Kreppel" /&gt;

[[Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe Party|Liberal Democrat (ELDR)]] [[Member of the European Parliament|MEP]] [[Chris Davies (Liberal Democrat politician)|Chris Davies]], says he has far more influence as a member of the European Parliament than he did as an opposition MP in the [[House of Commons of the United Kingdom|House of Commons]]. "Here I started to have an impact on day one", "And there has not been a month since when words I tabled did not end up in legislation."&lt;ref name="news.bbc.co.uk"&gt;{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/europe/3224666.stm | work=BBC News | title=The EU's democratic challenge | date=21 November 2003 | accessdate=1 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====European elections====
The low turnout at European elections has been cited as weakening the democratic legitimacy of the European Parliament: the BBC commented that in Britain many more votes were cast in an election on the reality show ''Big Brother'' than in the 1999 European Parliament election. On the other hand, the [[President of the European Parliament]] [the '[[Speaker (politics)|Speaker]]'] compared the turnout for the European Parliament to the presidential elections in the United States:
{{cquote|Turnout across Europe (1999) was higher than in the last US presidential election, and I don't hear people questioning the legitimacy of the presidency of the United States|author=[[Pat Cox]], President of the European parliament&lt;ref name="news.bbc.co.uk" /&gt;}}
In fact, the figures that are compared, the European Parliament voter turnout from 1999 (49.51%)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ukpolitical.info/european-parliament-election-turnout.htm |title=European Parliament election turnout |publisher=UK Political Info |date= |accessdate=10 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the US presidential voter turnout from 1996 (49%)&lt;ref&gt;[[Voter turnout in the United States presidential elections]]&lt;/ref&gt; are only marginally different, and the US voter turnout for 1996 was the lowest turnout in the US since 1924 (when it was 48.9%). The turnout in European elections has also been declining every election without exception to a low of 42.54% in 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Euractiv.Com |url=http://www.euractiv.com/sections/eu-elections-2014/its-official-last-eu-election-had-lowest-ever-turnout-307773 |title=It's official: Last EU election had lowest-ever turnout |publisher=Euractiv.com |date=25 May 2014 |accessdate=10 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Matej Avbelj (Director of the Law Institute in Ljubljana, Slovenia), the EU democratic deficit can be viewed as having a formal component (which is likely to be remedied) but also a social component resulting from people's low acceptance of the EU, as evidenced by low voter turnout.&lt;ref name="eumap.org"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eumap.org/journal/features/2005/demodef/avbelj|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090607162352/http://www.eumap.org/journal/features/2005/demodef/avbelj/|archivedate=7 June 2009|title=Can the New European Constitution Remedy the EU 'Democratic Deficit'?|first=Matej|last= Avbelj |publisher=[[Open Society Institute]]|quote=In its ''formal'' character, the democratic deficit is measured according to the ideal of a formal legitimacy which corresponds to legality understood in the sense that democratic institutions and processes created the law on which they are based and comply with. In its social character, the democratic deficit strives for a social legitimacy that connotes a broad, empirically determined social acceptance of the system.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Legal commentators such as Schmidt and Follesdal argue that the European Union lacks politics that individual citizens understand. This flows from the lack of knowledge of political parties and is reinforced by the lack of votes at European Union elections.

===Council of the European Union===
Voting in [[Council of the European Union|the Council]] (of relevant Ministers) is usually by [[qualified majority voting]], and sometimes unanimity is required. This means that, for the vast majority of EU legislation, the corresponding national government has usually voted in favour in the Council. To give an example, up to September 2006, out of the 86 pieces of legislation adopted in that year the Government of the United Kingdom had voted in favour of the legislation 84 times, abstained from voting twice and never voted against.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.consilium.europa.eu/cms3_fo/showPage.asp?id%3D1279%26lang%3DEN |title=Archived copy |accessdate=1 July 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090131055002/http://www.consilium.europa.eu/cms3_fo/showPage.asp?id=1279&amp;lang=EN |archivedate=31 January 2009 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Development of democratic legitimacy and transparency==
Over time, a number of constitutional changes have been introduced to increase democratic legitimacy:
*The [[Maastricht Treaty]] introduced 
**the status of EU citizenship, granting EU citizens the right to vote and stand in elections to the European Parliament and municipal elections in their country of residence, irrespective of their nationality (subject to age and residency qualifications).&lt;ref name="Schütze Maastricht"&gt;{{cite book| last  = Schütze | first   = Robert| title   = European Constitutional Law | year    = 2012| publisher  = Cambridge University Press| isbn    = 978-0-521-73275-8| pages   = 31–32 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
**the legislative procedure known as the "co-decision procedure", giving the directly elected European Parliament the right of "co-deciding" legislation on an equal footing with the Council of the European Union.&lt;ref name="Schütze Maastricht"/&gt;
*The [[Treaty of Lisbon]], which came into force on 1 December 2009 introduced
**a separate treaty title confirming that the functioning of the EU shall be founded on representative democracy and giving EU citizens both direct representation through the European Parliament and indirect representation via national governments through the Council of the European Union&lt;ref name="Schütze Lisbon"&gt;{{cite book| last  = Schütze | first   = Robert| title   = European Constitutional Law | year    = 2012| publisher  = Cambridge University Press| isbn    = 978-0-521-73275-8| pages   = 43–44 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
**the establishment of the co-decision procedure as the standard ("ordinary") legislative procedure&lt;ref name="Schütze Lisbon"/&gt;
**a significant increase in the powers of the European Parliament&lt;ref name="Schütze Lisbon"/&gt;
**the right of any EU citizen or resident to petition the European Parliament "on any matter which comes within the Union's field of activity and which affects him, her, or it directly".[Article 227 TFEU].&lt;ref name="Schütze petition"&gt;{{cite book| last  = Schütze | first   = Robert| title   = European Constitutional Law | year    = 2012| publisher  = Cambridge University Press| isbn    = 978-0-521-73275-8| page  = 99 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
**making meetings of the [[Council of the European Union|Council]] public when there is a general debate and when a proposal for a legislative act is voted on. These debates can be viewed&lt;ref&gt;video.consilium.europa.eu&lt;/ref&gt; in real time on the Internet.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.consilium.europa.eu/council?lang=en|title=The Council of the European Union)}} &lt;/ref&gt;

'''Dida''' is a [[dialect cluster]] of the [[Kru languages|Kru family]] spoken in [[Ivory Coast]].

ISO divides Dida into three groups, Yocoboué (Yokubwe) Dida (101,600 speakers in 1993), Lakota Dida (93,800 speakers in 1993), and Gaɓogbo (Guébié/Gebye) which are only marginally mutually intelligible and best considered separate languages. Yocoboué consists of the Lozoua (Lozwa) and Divo dialects (7,100 and 94,500 speakers), and Lakota the Lakota (Lákota), Abou (Abu), and Vata dialects. The [[prestige dialect]] is the Lozoua speech of the town of [[Guitry, Côte d'Ivoire|Guitry]].

==Phonology==
The Dida lects have consonant and vowel inventories typical of the Eastern Kru languages. However, tone varies significantly between dialects, or at least between their descriptions. The following phonology is that of Abu Dida, from Miller (2005).

===Vowels===
Dida has a ten-vowel system: nine vowels distinguished by "tenseness", likely either [[pharyngealization]] or supra-glottal [[phonation]] (contraction of the larynx) of the type described as [[retracted tongue root]], plus an uncommon mid-central vowel {{IPA|/ə/}}.

The non-contracted vowels are {{IPA|/i e a o u/}}, and the contracted vowels {{IPA|/eˤ ɛˤ ɔˤ oˤ/}}. (These could be analyzed as {{IPA|/iˤ eˤ oˤ uˤ/}}, but here are transcribed with lower vowels to reflect their phonetic realization. There is no tense contrast with the low vowel.) The [[formant]]s of the tense vowels show them to be [[open vowel|lower]] than their non-tense counterparts: the formants of the highest tense vowels overlap the formants of the non-tense mid vowels, but there is visible tension in the lips and throat when these are enunciated carefully.

Dida has a number of [[diphthong]]s, which have the same number of tonal distinctions as simple vowels. All start with the higher vowels, {{IPA|/i eˤ u oˤ/}}, and except for {{IPA|/a/}}, both elements are either contracted or non-contracted, so the pharyngealization is here transcribed after the second element of the vowel. Examples are {{IPA|/ɓue˨teoˤ˥˩/}} "bottle" (from English), {{IPA|/pa˨ɺeaˤ˨˩/}} "get stuck", and {{IPA|/feɔˤ˥˩/}} "little bone".

Dida also has nasal vowels, but they are not common and it is not clear how many. Examples are {{IPA|/fẽˤː˥/}} "nothing", {{IPA|/ɡ͡boũ˧/}} "chin", {{IPA|/pɔõˤ˥˧/}} "25 cents" (from English "pound"). In diphthongs, nasalization shows up primarily on the second element of the vowel.

Vowel length is not distinctive, apart from [[phonesthesia]] (as in {{IPA|/fẽˤː˥/}} "nothing"), morphemic contractions, and shortened [[grammatical word]]s, such as the modal {{IPA|/kă˥/}} "will" (compare its likely lexical source {{IPA|/ka˧/}} "get").

===Consonants===
The consonants are typical for Eastern Kru:

{| class="IPA wikitable" border="1"
|-
! !! Labial !! Alveolar !! Post-&lt;br&gt;alveolar !! Velar !! Labialized&lt;br&gt;velar !! Labial&lt;br&gt;velar
|-
! Nasal
| &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;m || &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;n || &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;ɲ || &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;ŋ || ||
|-
! Implosive
| &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;ɓ || || || || ||
|-
! Plosive/affricate
| p b || t d || t͡ʃ d͡ʒ || k ɡ || kʷ ɡʷ || k͡p ɡ͡b 
|-
! Fricative
| f v || s z ||  || &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;ɣ || ||
|-
! Tap/approximant
|  || &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;ɺ || &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;j || || colspan=2 align=center| w
|}

Syllables may be vowel only, consonant-vowel, or consonant-{{IPA|/ɺ/}}-vowel. {{IPA|/ɺ/}} is a lateral approximant {{IPA|[l]}} initially, a lateral flap {{IPA|[ɺ]}} between vowels and after most consonants ({{IPA|[ɓɺeˤ˥]}} "country"), but a central tap after alveolars ({{IPA|[dɾu˧]}} "blood"). After a nasal ({{IPA|/m/, /ɲ/, /ŋ/}}), it is itself nasalized, and sounds like a short ''n.'' There is a short epenthetic vowel between the initial consonant and the flap, which takes the quality of the syllabic vowel that follows ({{IPA|[ɓᵉɺeˤ˥]}} "country"). Flap clusters occur with all consonants, even the approximants ({{IPA|/wɺi˥/}} "top"), apart from the alveolar sonorants {{IPA|/n/, /ɺ/}} and the marginal consonant {{IPA|/ɣ/}}, which is only attested in the syllable {{IPA|/ɣa/}}.

{{IPA|/ɓ/}} is implosive in the sense that the [[airstream]] is powered by the glottis moving downward, but there is no rush of air into the mouth. {{IPA|/ɣ/}} occurs in few words, but one of these, {{IPA|/ɣa˧/}} "appear", occurs in numerous common idioms, so overall it's not an uncommon sound. It is a true fricative and may devoice to {{IPA|[x]}} word initially. {{IPA|/kʷ/}} and {{IPA|/ɡʷ/}} plus a vowel are distinct from {{IPA|/k/}} or {{IPA|/ɡ/}} plus {{IPA|/u/}} and another vowel. They may also be followed by a flap, as in {{IPA|/kʷɺeˤ˥/}} "face".

When emphasized, zero-onset words may take an initial {{IPA|[ɦ]}}, and initial approximants {{IPA|/j/, /w/}} may become fricated {{IPA|[ʝ], [ɣʷ]}}. {{IPA|/w/}} becomes palatalized {{IPA|[ɥ]}} before high front vowels, or {{IPA|[ʝʷ]}} when emphasized.

===Tones===
Dida uses tone as a grammatical device. Morpho-tonology plays a greater role in verb and pronominal paradigms than it does in nouns, and perhaps because of this, Dida verbs utilize a simpler tone system than nouns do: Noun roots have four lexically contrastive tones, subject pronouns have three, and verb roots have just two [[word tone]]s.

There are three level tones in Abou Dida: {{smallcaps|high}} {{IPA|/˥/}}, {{smallcaps|mid}} {{IPA|/˧/}}, and {{smallcaps|low}} {{IPA|/˨/}}, with {{smallcaps|mid}} about twice as common as the other two. Speaker intuition hears six [[contour tone]]s:  rising {{IPA|/˧˥/, /˨˧/}} and falling {{IPA|/˥˧/, /˥˩/, /˧˩/, /˨˩/}}. (The falling tones only reach {{smallcaps|bottom}} register at the end of a [[prosodic unit]]; otherwise the low falling tone {{IPA|/˨˩/}} is realized as a simple low tone.) However, some of these only occur in morphologically complex words, such as [[perfective aspect|perfective]] verbs.

Monosyllabic nouns contrast four tones: {{smallcaps|high, mid, low,}} and {{smallcaps|mid-falling}}: {{IPA|/dʒeˤ˥/}} "egg", {{IPA|/dʒeˤ˧/}} "leopard", {{IPA|/dʒeˤ˩/}} "buffalo", {{IPA|/dʒeˤ˧˩/}} "arrow", with {{smallcaps|high}} and {{smallcaps|mid}} being the most frequent.

'''Enchanta''' {{IPAc-en|ɛ|n|ˈ|tʃ|ɑː|n|t|ɑː}} ''(Enchan {{IPAc-en|ɛ|n|ˈ|tʃ|ɑː|n}} in the 2016 series)'' is a [[constructed language]] spoken by the denizens of [[Encantadia]], known as Encantado(s)/Encantada(s) or [[Diwata]] ([[fairies]]). It was initially created by [[Suzette Doctolero]] for the [[Philippines|Philippine]] [[fantaserye|fantasy]] [[television drama]] [[saga]] ''[[Encantadia Saga|Encantadia]]'', which aired on [[GMA Network]] in 2005,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sunstar.com.ph/static/ceb/2006/04/22/life/a.fitting.farewell.for.gma.7.s.grandest.telefantasya.encantadia.html A fitting farewell for GMA-7's grandest telefantasya, Encantadia] {{webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20120911005055/http://www.sunstar.com.ph/static/ceb/2006/04/22/life/a.fitting.farewell.for.gma.7.s.grandest.telefantasya.encantadia.html |date=2012-09-11 }}.

Retrieved on January 31, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; and was later used in the show's sequels, ''[[Etheria|Etheria: Ang Ikalimang Kaharian ng Encantadia]]'' and ''[[Encantadia: Pag-ibig Hanggang Wakas]]''. The source material of the language appears to have been derived from [[Philippine languages]] (particularly [[Tagalog language|Tagalog]]) and [[Romance languages]].  It has its own script, [[Enchan]], which appears to be based on [[Baybayin]]. Three songs in the language are written by Doctolero, namely "Asshenti (Love song)", "Hade!! (Etheria theme song)", and "Ivo ([[Lireo]] [[national anthem]])", which are all sung by [[Bayang Barrios]] for the sequel ''[[Etheria]]'' in 2006.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0494597/soundtrack Soundtracks for Etheria: ang Ikalimang Kaharian ng Encantadia].[[IMDb]].

==Overview==
Enchanta was created by Suzette Doctolero originally for the Philippine fantasy series Encantadia to make the viewers feel that the world  of Encantados be somehow realistic and genuine. Doctolero created its vocabulary from many Indo-European languages with some influences of Philippine languages especially Tagalog. It can be traced from words like "corre", to love (from the root "cor" meaning heart) and "avoya", to travel (voyage). The language is also notable of being spoken as it sounds like its from some kind of European country because of the tone and the phonotactics. Most characters from the Encantadia saga know how to speak Enchanta, but it was Cassiopeia that had spoken the language most in the whole series, from the fact that she is the first ''diwata'' (fairy) of Lireo and ancestor of all the royal-blooded ''diwatas'' of the Queendom.

The '''European Charter for Regional or Minority Languages''' ('''ECRML''') is a European [[treaty]] (CETS 148) adopted in 1992  under the auspices of the [[Council of Europe]] to protect and promote historical [[regional language|regional]] and [[minority language]]s in [[Europe]]. The preparation for the charter was undertaken by the predecessor to the current [[Congress of Local and Regional Authorities of the Council of Europe|Congress of Local and Regional Authorities]], the Standing Conference of Local and Regional Authorities of Europe because involvement of local and regional government was essential. The actual charter was written in the [[Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe|Parliamentary Assembly]] based on the Congress' Recommendations. It only applies to [[language]]s traditionally used by the nationals of the State Parties (thus excluding languages used by recent [[immigrant]]s from other states, see [[immigrant language]]s), which significantly differ from the majority or [[official language]] (thus excluding what the state party wishes to consider as mere local dialects of the official or majority language) and that either have a territorial basis (and are therefore traditionally spoken by populations of regions or areas within the State) or are used by linguistic minorities within the State as a whole (thereby including such languages as [[Yiddish language|Yiddish]], [[Romani language|Romani]] and [[Lemko language| Lemko]], which are used over a wide geographic area).

Some states, such as Ukraine and Sweden, have tied the status of minority language to the recognized national minorities, which are defined by ethnic, cultural and/or religious criteria, thereby circumventing the Charter's notion of linguistic minority.&lt;ref&gt;Hult, F.M. (2004). Planning for multilingualism and minority language rights in Sweden. ''Language Policy, 3''(2), 181-201.&lt;/ref&gt; 

Languages that are official within regions, provinces or federal units within a State (for example [[Catalan language|Catalan]] in [[Spain]]) are not classified as official languages of the State and may therefore benefit from the Charter. On the other hand, [[Republic of Ireland|Ireland]] has not been able to sign the Charter on behalf of the [[Irish language]] (although a minority language) as it is defined as the first official language of the state. The [[United Kingdom]] has ratified the Charter in respect to (among other languages) [[Welsh language|Welsh]] in [[Wales]], [[Scots language|Scots]] in Scotland, and [[Irish language in Northern Ireland|Irish]] in [[Northern Ireland]]. [[France]], although a signatory, has been constitutionally blocked from ratifying the Charter in respect to the [[languages of France]].

The charter provides a large number of different actions state parties can take to protect and promote historical regional and minority languages. There are two levels of protection&amp;mdash;all signatories must apply the lower level of protection to qualifying languages. Signatories may further declare that a qualifying language or languages will benefit from the higher level of protection, which lists a range of actions from which states must agree to undertake at least 35.

==Protections==
Countries can ratify the charter in respect of its minority languages based on Part II or Part III of the charter, which contain varying principles. Countries can treat languages differently under the charter, for example, in the [[United Kingdom]], the [[Welsh language]] is ratified under the general Part II principles as well as the more specific Part III commitments, while the [[Cornish language]] is ratified only under Part II.

===Part II===
Part II of the Charter details eight main principles and objectives upon which States must base their policies and legislation. They are seen as a framework for the preservation of the languages concerned.&lt;ref name="about"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.coe.int/t/dg4/education/minlang/aboutcharter/default_en.asp|title=The European Charter for Regional or Minority Languages is the European convention for the protection and promotion of languages used by traditional minorities.|website=European Charter for Regional &lt;br&gt;or Minority Languages}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*Recognition of regional or minority languages as an expression of cultural wealth.
*Respect for the geographical area of each regional or minority language.
*The need for resolute action to promote such languages.
*The facilitation and/or encouragement of the use of such languages, in speech and writing, in public and private life.
*The provision of appropriate forms and means for the teaching and study of such languages at all appropriate stages.
*The promotion of relevant transnational exchanges.
*The prohibition of all forms of unjustified distinction, exclusion, restriction or preference relating to the use of a regional or minority language and intended to discourage or endanger its maintenance or development.
*The promotion by states of mutual understanding between all the country’s linguistic groups.

===Part III===
Part III details comprehensive rules across a number of sectors, that states agree to abide by. Each language to which Part III of the Charter is applied must be specifically named by the government. States must select at least thirty-five of the undertakings in respect of each language.

The areas from which these specific undertakings must be chosen are as follows:&lt;ref name="about" /&gt;
*Education
*Judicial authorities
*Administrative authorities and public services
*Media
*Cultural activities and facilities
*Economic and social life
*Transfrontier exchanges

[[Edward Soja]] uses the term '''fractal city''' to describe the "metropolarities" and the restructured social mosaic of today's urban landscape or "postmetropolis". In his book, ''Postmetropolis: Critical Studies of Cities and Regions'', he discusses how the contemporary American city has become far more complex than the familiar upperclass vs. middleclass or black vs. white models of society. It has become a fractal city of intensified inequalities and [[social polarization]]. The term "fractal" gives it the idea of having a fractured social geometry. This is a patterning of ''metropolarities'', or an intensification of socio-economic inequalities, some of which Soja tries to pinpoint and discuss.

==Topics==

===The Removal of Distance===
[[William Julius Wilson|William Wilson]]'s location theory tries to give an explanation for the widening poverty and inequality gap. With rise of new technologies in recent decades, the new communication methods have allowed us to process and transmit information over great distances. This has, in a sense, destroyed distance. Distance no longer hinders communication as much as it used to. As a result, many businesses have relocated out of the inner city to the suburbs. Sadly, this leaves many ethnic communities stranded in the [[deindustrialization|deindustrialized]] inner city. They are unable to take part in the sudden shift to information-based and service-based industry jobs. Both [[Edward Soja]] and [[Saskia Sassen]] have written on this.

===Mono-Ethnic Geographies===
Soja uses Los Angeles as evidence that social inequalities and polarizations in American society ''have'' in fact been increasing, which partly due to [[globalization]] and economic restructuring. He describes the "ethnic quilt" of L.A., "a heterogeneous mosaic of new and old ethnicities". In this, he discusses ethnic niches as well as segregated cityspace, the spatial or geographical concentration of ethnic groups in L.A. Many parts of Los Angeles have experienced rapid [[demographic]] transformations in recent decades. Some neighborhoods have been "shifting from 80 percent white in 1965 to, in many areas, over 90 percent Latino today." Soja concludes by stating that "... Los Angeles remains one of the most segregated urban regions in the country."

Nevertheless, there are places that show exceptional ethnic diversity and equality, such as the cities of [[Gardena, California|Gardena]] and [[Carson, California|Carson]] in Los Angeles County that have had a perfectly even mix of white, black, Latino, and Asian percentages.

===End Note===
Soja urges us, in political struggles, to look beyond the simple equality politics of class, race and gender. Instead, we should look to "more cross-cutting and inclusive foundations of solidarity, collective consciousness, and coalition building".

'''Frans Gunnar Bengtsson''' (4 October 1894 &amp;ndash; 19 December 1954) was a Swedish novelist, essayist, poet and biographer. He was born in [[Tåssjö]] (now in [[Ängelholm Municipality]]) in [[Skåne]] and died at Ribbingsfors Manor in northern [[Västergötland]].

==Literary career==
Bengtsson began as a poet, with his debut work ''Tärningskast'' (Throwing Dice) published in 1923. In 1929 he published an essay collection titled ''Litteratörer och Militärer'' (Writers and Warriors) with contributions on [[François Villon]], [[Walter Scott]], [[Joseph Conrad]], and [[Stonewall Jackson]]. His essays mainly dealt with literary and historical subjects. A selection was translated into English in 1950 and published as ''A Walk to an Ant Hill and Other Essays''.

His biography on the Swedish king [[Charles XII]] (''Karl XII:s levnad'') 1932 is his [[Masterpiece|magnum opus]]. He describes the king through excerpts from contemporary diaries by officers and common soldiers, and from a wealth of quotes from the published literature. Bengtsson's work draws heavily on the biography of Charles XII by [[Voltaire]] published in 1731, thirteen years after the king’s death.

Later, Bengtsson became widely known for his [[Viking]] saga novel ''Röde Orm'' (''[[The Long Ships]]''),&lt;ref name=NYT&gt;{{cite web|work=[[The New York Times]]|title=The Long Ships (1963) Screen: 'The Long Ships': Widmark and Poitier in Viking Adventure|first=Howard|last=Thompson|date=June 25, 1964|url=https://www.nytimes.com/movie/review?res=9F02E4DF163DE13ABC4D51DFB066838F679EDE}}&lt;/ref&gt; published in two parts in 1941 and 1945. The hero Orm, later called Röde Orm (Red Snake) because of his red beard, is kidnapped as a boy onto a raiding ship and leads an exciting life in the Mediterranean area around the year 1000 AD. Later, he makes an expedition eastward into what is now Russia.  ''The Long Ships'' was later adapted into a film.&lt;ref name=NYT/&gt;

Bengtsson once said: "[[Joan of Arc]], [[Charles XII]], and [[Giuseppe Garibaldi|Garibaldi]] are the persons I would like to meet - for them the truth was more important than intrigues."{{Citation needed|date=September 2010}}

==Personal life==
Bengtsson married Gerda Fineman in 1939. He studied at the [[University of Lund]] from 1912, receiving a [[Licentiate (degree)|licentiate]] degree in English literature in 1930.{{citation needed|date=June 2014}}

The '''Ge''' or '''Gejia''' language ({{zh|[[File:Gě-chinese.svg|18px]]家语}}), also known as '''Chong'anjiang Miao 重安江苗语''', is a [[Miao languages|Miao language]] of [[Huangping County]], Guizhou, China. The endonym is spelled ''Mhong'', though it shares this with [[Huishui Miao]]; it is pronounced {{IPA|[m̥ōŋ]}}, as in the [[Hmong language]]. When speaking Chinese, they call themselves ''Gédōu''.

Gejia is spoken in eastern Guizhou, in speech islands within the area of the [[Hmu language]], which includes the standard dialect.

==Dongjia==
The Dongjia (东家) language of [[Majiang County]], Guizhou is related to Gejia. The Dongjia people are officially classified as [[She people|She]], but speak a [[West Hmongic]] language. Their autonym is ''Gameng'' (嘎孟), while the neighboring [[Raojia language|Raojia]] people call them ''Gadou'' (嘎斗). The Dongjia people of Liubao 六堡村, Xingshan Township 杏山镇, Majiang County was studied by Dong Bo (2008). Chen Xueyu (2011) considers Gejia and Dongjia to form two dialects of Chong'anjiang Miao, which belongs to the [[Chuanqiandian]] branch.

'''Gender polarization''' is a concept in [[sociology]] by American psychologist [[Sandra Bem]] which states that societies tend to define [[femininity]] and [[masculinity]] as polar opposite [[gender]]s, such that male-acceptable behaviors and attitudes are not seen as appropriate for women, and vice versa.&lt;ref name=twsMonnier&gt;Christine Monnier, 2011, Global Sociology, [https://globalsociology.pbworks.com/w/page/14711182/Gendered%20Society%20%E2%80%93%20Basic%20Concepts Gendered Society – Basic Concepts], Retrieved Aug. 22, 2014, "...

The planned '''German spelling reform of 1944''' was a failed attempt to amend German orthography. Although one million copies of the new rules were printed by 1944 for school use, the reform was never introduced. Their preparation was initiated by the [[Reichserziehungsministerium|Reich Education Minister]] [[Bernhard Rust]] and they were drawn up by [[Otto Basler]], [[Erich Gierach]] and [[Karl Reumuth]].

{{improve|reason="removal of the third consonant" would be no change as that was common practice (e.g. "Schiffahrt", although "Schiff- [linebreak] fahrt").
* Is "change" a wrong word for "features"?
* Is the part about 3rd consonant and linebreaks, i.e. should it have become "Schif- [linebreak] fahrt"?
|date=May 2018}}
Among the key changes were: 
* optional changes to the spelling of words of foreign origin to remove non-German combinations, e.g. ''Filosof'' for ''Philosoph'' meaning philosopher
* the removal of the third consonant in all groups of three consecutive consonants resulting from the combination of two words, e.g. ''Sauerstoff'''f'''lasche'' to ''Sauerstofflasche''.
* division of words at the end of a line according to the spoken syllables (''wa-rum'', ''da-rüber'', ''Fens-ter'')
* the disappearance of the comma before  main clauses introduced by ''und'' or ''oder''. 

On the orders of [[Hitler]], the introduction of the new rules in schools, which had been planned for the start of the 1944-45 school year, was postponed as it was considered "not important for the war effort". [[Otto Basler]] produced a slightly revised version of the rulebook in 1948, but the innovations contained in it were not implemented.

Some of the proposed changes, such as the comma before the conjunction ''und'' becoming optional and the hyphenation changes, were included in the [[German spelling reform of 1996]].

Some of Rust's proposed spellings could be found in the dictionary up to the 1980s, such as the spelling ''Kautsch''.

'''Haji Mohammed Allarakha Shivji''' (13 December 1878 — 21 January 1921), also spelled '''Hajji Mohammad Alarakhiya''', was a [[Gujarati language|Gujarati]] [[literary]] [[journalist]] and [[author]].

==Life==
Haji Mohammed Allarakha Shivji was born on 13 December 1878 in [[Bombay]] to [[Khoja]] businessman. He was a native of [[Kutch]]. He studied Gujarati initially at home, and later studied up to the sixth grade at Fort Highschool in Bombay. After 1895, he studied [[Hindi]], English and [[Marathi language|Marathi]]. In order to bring magazine like ''[[The Strand Magazine]]'' in Gujarati, he founded ''Visami Sadi'' (The Twentieth Century), a pictorial periodical in 1914 and published it from 1916 to 1920.&lt;ref name="Kendra2007"&gt;{{cite book|author=Smt.

==Biography==
Karla Höcker's father [[Paul Oskar Höcker]] was already a best-selling author when Karla was born, in [[Charlottenburg]]. Her grandfather, [[Oskar Höcker]], and her great-uncle, [[Gustav Höcker]], were likewise writers. Karla was initially trained as a musician; she studied at the [[Berlin University of the Arts|Berliner Musikhochschule]] and became a musical director. Soon, however, she began to work as a writer, especially after her father fell ill and she had to assist him.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Neue Deutsche Biographie Vol. 9|year=2003|publisher=Duncker &amp; Humblot|page=305|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Dy4ZAQAAIAAJ&amp;q=%22Christiane+Rautter%22&amp;dq=%22Christiane+Rautter%22&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=7cOFTOftF8OclgfR35DZDg&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=6&amp;ved=0CD0Q6AEwBQ}}&lt;/ref&gt; She worked as a journalist and a writer about music, before becoming a professor of music in [[Berlin]]. She received an honorary degree in 1977.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Höcker, Karla Alexandra|url=http://www.luise-berlin.de/ehrung/h/hocker_karla_alexandra.htm|publisher=Berlin ehrt Persönlichkeiten|accessdate=7 September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1920s and 1930s, she was a member of the [[Bornimer Kreis]], a circle of architects, musicians, writers, and other artists and intellectuals; the nucleus of the Bornimer Kreis consisted of landscape architects [[Karl Foerster]], [[Hermann Mattern]], and [[Herta Hammerbacher]]. Members included pianist and composer [[Wilhelm Kempff]], conductor and composer [[Wilhelm Furtwängler]] (whom Höcker later went on tour with), and architects [[Otto Bartning]] and [[Hans Poelzig]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Go|first=Jeong-Hi|title=Herta Hammerbacher: (1900–1985) : Virtuosin der Neuen Landschaftlichkeit – der Garten als Paradigma|year=2006|publisher=Univerlagtuberlin|isbn=978-3-7983-2013-0|pages=26|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=0g_Gdx9fZRIC&amp;pg=PA26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

She spent [[World War II]] in Berlin, and published a war memoir, ''Beschreibung eines Jahres: Berliner Notizen 1945'', in which she noted, with surprise, that the [[Red Army]] did not kill or deport the majority of the civilian population,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Grossman|first=Atina|title=Life after death: approaches to a cultural and social history of Europe during the 1940s and 1950s|year=2003|publisher=Cambridge UP|isbn=978-0-521-00922-5|pages=93–128|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=NilW70Yol74C&amp;pg=PA101|editor=Richard Bessel, Dirk Schumann|accessdate=7 September 2010|chapter=Trauma, Memory, and Motherhood}}&lt;/ref&gt; and, like other authors of the period, spoke of how Berlin in 1945 and 1946 was felt to be in an "in-between" time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Grossman|first=Atina|title=Jews, Germans, and Allies: Close Encounters in Occupied Germany|year=2009|publisher=Princeton UP|isbn=978-0-691-14317-0|pages=272 n.7|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=mmPklXqPHGwC&amp;pg=PA272}}&lt;/ref&gt; After the war, she became friends with [[Dietrich Fischer-Dieskau]], one of the greatest [[Lieder]] performers of the post-war period, and later collaborated with him in his writings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Neunzig|first=Hans Adolf|title=Dietrich Fischer-Dieskau: a biography|year=1998|publisher=Hal Leonard|isbn=978-1-57467-035-6|pages=45|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=PP5DnhIA3eQC&amp;pg=PA45}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Works==
Höcker wrote novels and biographies of artists and musicians, and did interviews for German radio.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Literaturarchiv: Karla Höcker Archiv|url=http://www.adk.de/de/archiv/archivbestand/literatur/index.htm?hg=literatur&amp;we_objectID=317|publisher=[[Akademie der Künste]]|accessdate=7 September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; She published some of those interviews in ''Gespraeche mit Berliner Kuenstlern'' ("Conversations with Berlin artists").

'''Mother Mary Bonaventure Browne''' (born after 1610, died after 1670) was a [[Poor Clare]] [[nun]], [[abbess]], and Irish historian.

==Background==
{{unreferenced section|date=November 2015}}
A daughter of Andrew Browne fitz Oliver, a wealthy merchant and a member of [[The Tribes of Galway]]. She was a niece of Martin Browne, whose townhouse doorway, the Browne doorway, now stands in [[Eyre Square]]. Andrew was a first cousin of Sir [[Dominick Browne (mayor)|Dominick Browne]], former [[Mayor of Galway]] and the father of [[Valentine Browne, OFM]], Provincial of [[Franciscans]] 1629-1635. Her elder brother, Francis, later joined the Franciscans, while Mary and her sister Catherine joined the [[Poor Clares]] in 1632. In that year her father Andrew was elected one of the town sheriffs but refused to take the [[Oath of Supremacy]], as had his father in 1609, and thus was not sworn in.

==The Poor Clares==

Following their banishment from [[Dublin]] in November 1630, the Poor Clares removed to Bethleham, in what was then the townland of Bleanphuttogue, parish of Kilkenny West, [[County Westmeath]], a remote area on the shores of [[Lough Ree]] some eight miles (13&amp;nbsp;km) north-west of [[Athlone]] and four and a half miles southwest of [[Ballymahon]], [[County Longford]]. Within a few years there were sixty members.

Following a request from some citizens of [[Galway]], twelve sister and two [[novice]]s moved there during or immediately after January 1642. Mary and Catherine, who were professed at Bethlehem in 1633, were among the group. The [[Abbess]] at Bethleham was Mother Cicely Dillon, a sister of Sir [[James Dillon (officer)]] and both children of [[Theobald Dillon, 1st Viscount Dillon]]. At Galway the Abbess was, successively, [[Mary Gabriel Martyn]], [[Mary Clare Kennedy]], and Mary during 1647-50, being succeeded by her sister Catherine. The convent was located in or near what is now St. Augustine Street.

==Abbess in Galway==
In her first year, Mary commissioned [[Dubhaltach Mac Fhirbhisigh]] to complete the work of translating ''The Rule of St. Clare'' and related documents into [[Irish language|Irish]]. This had been begun prior to October 1636 by Father Aodh O Raghailligh and [[Séamus Ó Siaghail]]. It was transcribed in mid-October 1636 by Brother [[Mícheál Ó Cléirigh]]. Mac Fhirbhisigh translated and transcribed the remaining sections (some two-thirds of the total) from [[English language|English]] into Irish and "designed it to be a continuation of the manuscript executed by Ó Cléirigh". It was completed on 8 December 1657, and is now [[Royal Irish Academy]] MS D i 2.

[[Helena Concannon]] remarks that "It is additional proof of Mother Bonaventure's keen interest in Irish to find that she had brought this MS with her from Bethleham". The fact that she commissioned Mac Fhirbhisigh to complete the work is a very interesting marker of the high status of the Irish language, all the more surprising in a convent twelve of whose members were of [[Old English]] stock.

While Abbess, Mother Mary oversaw plans for founding a daughter-house of the Galway convent at [[Loughrea]]. The foundation document, now preserved in the Poor Clare archives in Galway, led to the house's apparent existence in 1649-50, but due to the warfare which soon arose in the county seems to have been short-lived.

In the summer of 1649, Mother Mary sent a petition to the "Mayors, Sheriffs, Free Burgesses and Commonalty of the Towne of Galway" stating that, due to excessive rent, they would be obliged to leave their current home at the end of the lease, which occurred the following May. Therefore, she petitioned that "you may be pleased to grant them sufficient room for building a monastery and rooms convenient thereunto a garden and orchard in the next island adjoining to the bridge Illaun Altenagh." The Mayor and Recorder recommended the grant on 1 July and on 10 July the Corporation unanimously agreed and granted the petition. The convent on Oileán Ealtanach - now called Nun's Island - was "a good large and spacious house with other conveniences with the cost and charge of two hundred and odd pounds of the Sisters' portions in timber and other materials".

==Exile==

Though at least one new sister was professed as late as 1652, the years during and after the move to Nun's Island was marked by a visitation of plague, a nine-month siege, warfare and famine. Galway surrendered to [[Sir Charles Coote]] and his army in April 1652, marking the advent of a very different regime. In January 1653 an edict "commanding all nuns of whatsoever condition, to marry or quit the kingdom." Most of the Galway community travelled by ship to [[Spain]]; Mother Cicely Dillon died en route. Mary's sister, Mother Catherine Bernard Browne, died in [[Madrid]] in 1654.

==Her work as a historian==

During her years of exile in Madrid, Mother Mary wrote "a huge work, in quarto, in the Irish language." Written c. 1670 at the convent of El Cavallero de Garcia, "it is particularly regrettable that the original of the great work is no longer extant, since a prose work in Irish by a pre-twentieth century female author would be a very rare thing indeed."

While almost the entire of the records of El Cavallero de Garcia, including this book, are now thought to be lost, there is a strong suggestion that the ''narrative'' which opens the annals of the Poor Clares of Galway could be an English translation of the second tractae of her book. Mother Mary's work comprised the following:

*I    - Historical disquisition concerning haeresiarchs and the persecutions for which they are responsible.
*II   - The Martyrdom of certain Poor Clares and Tertiaries during the reign of terror in Ireland.
*III  - The Life of Henry VIII.
*IV   - the Life of Anne Boleyn.
*V    - the Life of Queen Catherine.
*VI   - the Acts of Saint Colette.
*VII  - The Life of Blessed Margaret del Pilar, Poor Clare.
*VIII - The Life of the Saintly Queen of Sicily.
*IX   - Historical Tract concerning various people who lived devout lives in the world.
*X    - Concerning the Devotion of the Rosary and its origin.
*XI   - Concerning other Rosaries granted by the bounty of God to those devout to him.

Celsus O'Brien quotes the Poor Clare Annalist: "The Third Abbess of said Convent, Mary Bonaventure (alias) Browne, was a very good holy and perfect religious Sister, and was endowed with many rare virtues, as [[obedience, poverty, chastity]], humility and charity. She was prudent and wise, well spoken in English, Irish and Spanish. She was the mirror and looking glass of religious observance that belonged to her Rule and status all of her lifetime. She left a True Chronicle written under her own hand, which she sent to this convent of Saint Clare, Galway, and a Remonstrance, a chalice, a holy curious relic, many pictures, books, ornaments, and other fine things fitting for the alter and Divine Service. All the aforesaid things were lost and burnt in the late wars, 1691."

In addition, she is said to have written a life, in English, of her sister, Catherine Browne. The dowry of Catherine - "due by bond of Andrew Browne and Sir Dominick Browne, knight, was put in trust for them in the names of [[Patrick D'Arcy]] and [[Richard Óge Martyn]], Esq." Sir Dominick's wife was a sister of Darcy, while he and Richard Martyn were married to two of the sisters and heiress, Mary and Magdalene,who were daughters of Sir Peter French.

Her year of death is unknown, but she is believed to have been after 1670, and before 1691.

'''Nicolas Saboly''' (30 January 1614 – 26 July 1675) was a French poet, composer and [[choirmaster]]. He composed many Christmas carols in the [[Provençal dialect]] which form one of the monuments of poetry in that language and have been repeatedly republished until the present day.

== Life ==

Nicolas Saboly was born on 31 January 1614 in [[Monteux]] to a family of herdsmen.{{efn|From this origin Saboly probably drew inspiration for the pastoral scenes of his carols.{{sfn|Faury|1876|p=49, note}} }}
His great-grandfather Claude Saboly and his grandfather Raymond Saboly followed this occupation. 
It was  Raymond Saboly  who came to settle in Monteux.
Nicolas was the youngest son of Felisa Meilheuret and Jean Saboly.{{efn|Jean Saboly, father of Nicolas, was consul of Monteux in 1636. His parents were Marguerite Chinard and Raymond Saboly, and his grandparents were Marguerite Dany and Claude Saboly.}}
He had an older brother named Jean-Pierre Saboly and three sisters named Anne, Félicia (Felisa) and Claire.

=== Student destined for the priesthood ===

Saboly's father died on 15 August 1619, and Nicolas entered the [[Jesuit]] college of [[Carpentras]]. 
At the end of his schooling he became a member of the Congregation of the Annunciation of the Blessed Virgin on 14 May 1628.{{sfn|Faury|1876|p=29}}
In the autumn of 1628 he left his college to begin taking classes at the [[University of Avignon]]. 
He received the tonsure in 1630 and attended courses in law and theology, as evidenced by two notarial acts of 12 March 1632 and 27 December 1633, which he witnessed as a student of theology. 
In 1634 he left the University without taking his degrees. 
On 27 September 1635 he was ordained a sub-deacon, deacon and priest.&lt;ref&gt;Carpentras, Acts of the secretariat of the Bishop.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Career as choirmaster ===
[[File:Grand orgue Saint Siffrein.JPG|thumb| Great organ at Saint-Siffrein Cathedral in Carpentras]]
In 1639 Nicolas Saboly obtained the position of organist and choirmaster of the Saint-Siffrein Cathedral&lt;sup&gt;([[:fr:Cathédrale Saint-Siffrein de Carpentras|fr]])&lt;/sup&gt; in [[Carpentras]].{{efn|Saboly is mentioned several times in the cathedral's account book, vol. 1607–1648, with monthly wages of 3 lt. ([[livre tournois]]); he also received occasional pay for a solemn feast.{{sfn|Faury|1876|pp=33-34}} }}
He was occasionally employed in local festivals, such as on 22 September 1639 when the clergy of [[Caromb]] asked him to play the organ for the parish festival of St. Maurice.
He received 10 florins and 12 sous for his performance.{{efn|Caromb AM : CC 20, vol. 21, f. 38, 1639.{{sfn|Faury|1876|pp=179-180}} }}
His name disappears from the accounts of Saint-Siffrein after 20 June 1643, when he was replaced by the choirmaster David.

Nicolas Saboly went to [[Arles]] where he was choirmaster from 1643 to 1646, then the cathedral of [[Aix-en-Provence]] from 1652 to 1655.{{efn|Cf. Aix-en-Provence AM : Comptes du Trésorier, CC 606, f. 1090v-1091v et 1116-1117, et CC 611 f. 439 et 450.{{sfn|Westrup|1940|pp=35-38}} }}
He was in [[Nîmes]] in 1659.{{efn|Cf. AD Gard : Registre des Insinuations, G 907, f. 76v-77r.{{sfn|Westrup|1940|pp=35-38}} }}
He was choirmaster of the collegiate church of Saint-Pierre d'Avignon&lt;sup&gt;([[:fr:Basilique Saint-Pierre d'Avignon|fr]])&lt;/sup&gt; from before 1668 until his death.{{efn|He had deposited a first version of his will on 17 July 1668 in Avignon : cf. AD Vaucluse, notaire Lapeyre, vol. 85, f. 650.{{sfn|Westrup|1940|pp=35-38}} }}

=== Ecclesiastical benefices ===

Like many priests of his time, Saboly obtained several ecclesiastical benefits. 
On 16 April 1633  he became chaplain of St. Mary Magdalene in the Cathedral of Saint Siffrein in Carpentras.{{sfn|Faury|1876|p=32}}{{sfn|Boudin|1867|p=10}}
He kept this benefice until 1663.{{efn|Carpentras, Acts of the secretariat of the Bishop. Benefice attributed by the grand vicaire Villardi on the resignation of Pierre Julliani.}}
On 28 March 1658 he was issued a certificate of studies that found he had attended courses at the University of Avignon from 1628 to 1634, and was given a certificate of aptitude for obtaining profits in the dioceses of Nîmes and [[Uzès]].{{sfn|Boudin|1867|p=10 note 1}}

On 10 June 1660, after a lengthy process, he obtained a pension of 100 lt. ([[livre tournois]]) from the papal administration to take on the priory and the benefit of Saint-Benoît-de-Cayran in the diocese of Uzès.{{efn|His relations with the pontifical administration of Avignon were far from being serene since Nicolas Saboly in 1662 wrote a satire of 35 couplets (of eight octosyllabic verses each) against it.}}
After returning to Avignon he obtained the chaplaincy of Saint Mary, which he still held in 1663.

=== Testament and death ===

On 21 April 1671 Saboly's will was notarized by François Julien in Marseilles.{{sfn|Boudin|1867}}
Saboly made his niece Claire Saboly (wife of Christophe Chardenas, bourgeois of Roquemaure, Gard) ) his universal heiress. 
He also bequeathed 600 lt. to his servant Isabeau Sevique, and reserved from his niece's legacy an annuity with 600 lt. of capital yielding 30 lt. annually to be paid to the chapter of Saint-Pierre d'Avignon so that after his death two masses would be said each week in his memory. 
He died four years later on 25 July 1675 in Avignon.&lt;ref&gt;Avignon AM, paroisse Saint-Pierre, registre des décès.&lt;/ref&gt;
He is buried in the choir of the Saint-Pierre church.

Saboly's career as a choirmaster was standard for this period. 
He is famous for the carols that he composed.

These many editions reflect the literary movement of the [[Félibrige]]s. The list below is not exhaustive.

== List of carols ==

Saboly did not compose all the Christmas carols that were attributed to him. 
They were originally published without music because they were sung to popular tunes that everyone knew by heart.
Saboly simply gave a note like "on the air of the echo", "on the air of the pastouro" or sometimes "On an air by Saboly".

The Provencal Documentation Center has retained in its booklet devoted to this author a list of 48 carols definitely composed by Saboly.

Following are the carols are according to the François Seguin edition of 1856:{{sfn|Seguin|1856}}

== Opinions about Nicolas Saboly and his work ==

{{quote|The Provençals take Saboly for Christmas as they take eggs for Easter and for Palm Sunday take a gratin of chickpeas. |[[Frédéric Mistral]] }}
{{quote|One cannot understand all the delicacy of Saboly's Christmas poetry if it is separated from the music. The lyrics are, in fact, so closely related to the melody that there is only one way to read them, which is to sing them.|J. B. Faury{{sfn|Faury|1876}} }}
{{quote|Saboly, thanks to his carols, has become a real classic of Occitan literature; it is almost certain that in no other language can such an Attic perfection be found in such a simply popular manner.
|Professeur Charles Camproux, de l'Université de Montpellier{{sfn|Camproux|1971}} }}
{{quote|Saboly's style could be compared to that of La Bellaudière, as Pascal's prose could be compared to that of Montaigne|François Seguin{{sfn|Seguin|1856}} }}
{{quote|Nicolas Saboly is, with [[Bellaud de la Bellaudière]], a golden link in the chain that unites Mistral to the troubadours.|Bruno Durand, conservateur de la Bibliothèque Méjanes d'Aix-en-Provence. {{sfn|Durand|1963}} }}
{{quote|Saboly's influence was considerable: he was one of the masters of Roumanille and Mistral.|Charles Rostaing, professeur à la Sorbonne, et René Jouveau, capoulier du Félibrige {{sfn|Rostaing|Jouveau|1972}} }}
{{quote|His work contains an emotion tinged with good-nature that does not exclude certain political allusions and a merry mockery. He combined the inspiration of the Middle Ages with the knowledge of [[La Fontaine]].|André Bouyala d'Arnaud, conservateur de la Bibliothèque de la ville de Marseille{{sfn|Bouyala d'Arnaud|1962}} }}

{{Old English topics}}

'''Old English''' ({{lang|ang|Ænglisc, Anglisc, Englisc}}, {{IPA-ang|ˈæŋliʃ|pron}}), or '''Anglo-Saxon''',&lt;ref&gt;By the 16th century the term ''Anglo-Saxon'' came to refer to all things of the early English period, including language, culture, and people. While it remains the normal term for the latter two aspects, the language began to be called Old English towards the end of the 19th century, as a result of the increasingly strong anti-Germanic nationalism in English society of the 1890s and early 1900s. However many authors still also use the term Anglo-Saxon to refer to the language.&lt;br/&gt; {{cite book |last=Crystal |first=David |title=The Cambridge Encyclopedia of the English Language |publisher=Cambridge University Press |year=2003 |isbn=0-521-53033-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; is the earliest historical form of the [[English language]], spoken in [[England]] and southern and eastern [[Scotland]] in the early [[Middle Ages]]. It was brought to [[Great Britain]] by [[Anglo-Saxon settlement of Britain|Anglo-Saxon settlers]] probably in the mid-5th century, and the first [[Old English literature|Old English literary works]] date from the mid-7th century. After the [[Norman conquest]] of 1066, English was replaced, for a time, as the language of the upper classes by [[Anglo-Norman language|Anglo-Norman]], a [[langues d'oïl|relative of French]]. This is regarded as marking the end of the Old English era, as during this period the English language was heavily influenced by Anglo-Norman, developing into a phase known now as [[Middle English]].

Old English developed from a set of [[Anglo-Frisian languages|Anglo-Frisian]] or [[Ingvaeonic]] dialects originally spoken by [[Germanic peoples|Germanic]] tribes traditionally known as the [[Angles]], [[Saxons]] and [[Jutes]]. As the [[Anglo-Saxons]] became dominant in England, their language [[Celtic language-death in England|replaced]] the languages of [[Roman Britain]]: [[Common Brittonic]], a [[Celtic languages|Celtic language]], and [[Latin]], brought to Britain by [[Roman conquest of Britain|Roman invasion]]. Old English had four main dialects, associated with particular [[heptarchy|Anglo-Saxon kingdoms]]: [[Mercian dialect|Mercian]], [[Northumbrian dialect|Northumbrian]], [[Kentish dialect (Old English)|Kentish]] and [[West Saxon dialect|West Saxon]]. It was West Saxon that formed the basis for the literary standard of the later Old English period,&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; although the dominant forms of Middle and [[Modern English]] would develop mainly from Mercian. The speech of eastern and northern parts of England was subject to strong [[Old Norse]] influence due to [[Danelaw|Scandinavian rule]] and settlement beginning in the 9th century.

Old English is one of the [[West Germanic languages]], and its closest relatives are [[Old Frisian]] and [[Old Saxon]]. Like other old Germanic languages, it is very different from Modern English and difficult for Modern English speakers to understand without study. [[Old English grammar]] is quite similar to that of modern [[German language|German]]: nouns, adjectives, pronouns and verbs have many [[inflection]]al endings and forms, and [[word order]] is much freer.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; The oldest Old English inscriptions were written using a [[Anglo-Saxon runes|runic system]], but from about the 9th century this was replaced by a [[Old English Latin alphabet|version of the Latin alphabet]].

==Terminology==
''Englisc'', which the term ''English'' is [[List of English words of Anglo-Saxon origin|derived from]], means 'pertaining to the Angles'.&lt;ref&gt;Fennell, Barbara 1998. ''A history of English. A sociolinguistic approach''. Oxford: Blackwell. &lt;/ref&gt; In Old English, this word was derived from ''Angles'' (one of the [[Germanic tribe]]s who conquered parts of Great Britain in the 5th century).&lt;ref&gt;Pyles, Thomas and John Algeo 1993. ''Origins and development of the English language''. 4th edition. (New York: Harcourt, Brace, Jovanovich). &lt;/ref&gt; During the [[9th century]], all invading Germanic tribes were referred to as ''Englisc''. It has been hypothesised that the Angles acquired their name because their land on the coast of [[Jutland]] (now mainland [[Denmark]]) resembled a [[fishhook]]. [[Proto-Germanic]] {{wikt-lang|gem-x-proto|*anguz}} also had the meaning of 'narrow', referring to the shallow waters near the coast. That word ultimately goes back to Proto-Indo-European ''{{wikt-lang|ine-x-proto|*h₂enǵʰ-}}'', also meaning 'narrow'.&lt;ref&gt;Barber, Charles, Joan C. Beal and Philip A. Shaw 2009. ''The English language. A historical introduction''. Second edition of Barber (1993). Cambridge: University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

Another theory is that the derivation of 'narrow' is the more likely connection to [[angling]] (as in [[fishing]]), which itself stems from a [[Proto-Indo-European root|Proto-Indo-European (PIE) root]] meaning ''bend, angle''.&lt;ref&gt;Mugglestone, Lynda (ed.) 2006. ''The Oxford History of English.'' Oxford: University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; The semantic link is the fishing hook, which is curved or bent at an angle.&lt;ref&gt;Hogg, Richard M. and David Denison (ed.) 2006. ''A history of the English language''. Cambridge: University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; In any case, the Angles may have been called such because they were a [[fishing]] people or were originally descended from such, and therefore England would mean 'land of the [[fishermen]]', and English would be 'the fishermen's language'.&lt;ref&gt;Baugh, Albert C. and Thomas Cable 1993 ''A history of the English language''. 4th edition. (Englewood Cliffs: Prentice Hall). &lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

Old English was not static, and its usage covered a period of 700 years, from the [[Anglo-Saxon settlement of Britain]] in the 5th century to the late 11th century, some time after the Norman invasion. While indicating that the establishment of dates is an arbitrary process, Albert Baugh dates Old English from 450 to 1150, a period of full inflections, a [[synthetic language]].&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Perhaps around 85 per cent of Old English words are no longer in use, but those that survived are basic elements of [[Modern English]] vocabulary.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

Old English is a [[West Germanic language]], developing out of [[Ingvaeonic languages|Ingvaeonic]] (also known as North Sea Germanic) dialects from the 5th century. It came to be spoken over most of the territory of the [[heptarchy|Anglo-Saxon kingdoms]] which became the [[Kingdom of England]]. This included most of present-day England, as well as part of what is now southeastern [[Scotland]], which for several centuries belonged to the Anglo-Saxon [[kingdom of Northumbria]]. Other parts of the island – [[Wales]] and most of [[Scotland]] – continued to use [[Celtic languages]], except in the areas of Scandinavian settlements where [[Old Norse]] was spoken. Celtic speech also remained established in certain parts of England: [[Cornish language#Middle Cornish|Medieval Cornish]] was spoken all over [[Cornwall]] and in adjacent parts of [[Devon]], while [[Cumbric language|Cumbric]] survived perhaps to the 12th century in parts of [[Cumbria]], and [[Welsh language|Welsh]] may have been spoken on the English side of the [[England–Wales border|Anglo-Welsh border]]. Norse was also widely spoken in the parts of England which fell under [[Danelaw|Danish law]].

Anglo-Saxon literacy developed after [[Christianisation of Anglo-Saxon England|Christianisation]] in the late 7th century. The oldest surviving text of [[Old English literature]] is ''[[Cædmon's Hymn]]'', composed between 658 and 680.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; There is a limited corpus of [[Anglo-Saxon runes|runic inscriptions]] from the 5th to 7th centuries, but the oldest coherent runic texts (notably the [[Franks Casket]]) date to the 8th century. The [[Old English Latin alphabet]] was introduced around the 9th century.

[[File:Statue d'Alfred le Grand à Winchester.jpg|thumb|right|upright=0.86|[[Alfred the Great]] statue in [[Winchester]], [[Hampshire]]. The 9th-century English King proposed that primary education be taught in English, with those wishing to advance to holy orders to continue their studies in Latin.]]
With the unification of the Anglo-Saxon kingdoms (outside the [[Danelaw]]) by [[Alfred the Great]] in the later 9th century, the language of government and literature became standardised around the [[West Saxon dialect]] (Early West Saxon). Alfred [[Alfred the Great#Advocacy of education in the English language|advocated education in English]] alongside Latin, and had many works translated into the English language; some of them, such as [[Pope Gregory I]]'s treatise ''[[Pastoral Care]]'', appear to have been translated by Alfred himself. In Old English, typical of the development of literature, poetry arose before prose, but King Alfred the Great (871 to 901) chiefly inspired the growth of prose.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

A later literary standard, dating from the later 10th century, arose under the influence of Bishop [[Æthelwold of Winchester]], and was followed by such writers as the prolific [[Ælfric of Eynsham]] ("the Grammarian"). This form of the language is known as the "[[Winchester]] standard", or more commonly as Late West Saxon. It is considered to represent the "classical" form of Old English.&lt;ref&gt;Hogg (1992), p. 83.&lt;/ref&gt; It retained its position of prestige until the time of the Norman Conquest, after which English ceased for a time to be of importance as a literary language.

The history of Old English can be subdivided into:
*Prehistoric Old English (c. 450 to 650); for this period, Old English is mostly a [[reconstructed language]] as no literary witnesses survive (with the exception of limited [[Anglo-Saxon runes|epigraphic evidence]]). This language, or bloc of languages, spoken by the Angles, Saxons, and Jutes, and pre-dating documented Old English or Anglo-Saxon, has also been called Primitive Old English.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Stumpf |first=John |title=An Outline of English Literature; Anglo-Saxon and Middle English Literature |year=1970 |publisher=Forum House Publishing Company |place=London |page=7 |quote=We do not know what languages the Jutes, Angles, and Saxons spoke, nor even whether they were sufficiently similar to make them mutually intelligible, but it is reasonable to assume that by the end of the sixth century there must have been a language that could be understood by all and this we call Primitive Old English.}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
*Early Old English (c. 650 to 900), the period of the oldest manuscript traditions, with authors such as [[Cædmon]], [[Bede]], [[Cynewulf]] and [[Aldhelm]].
*Late Old English (c. 900 to 1066), the final stage of the language leading up to the Norman conquest of England and the subsequent transition to [[Early Middle English]].

The Old English period is followed by [[Middle English]] (12th to 15th century), [[Early Modern English]] (c. 1480 to 1650) and finally [[Modern English]] (after 1650).

==Dialects==

Old English should not be regarded as a single monolithic entity, just as [[Modern English]] is also not monolithic. It emerged over time out of the many [[dialect]]s and languages of the colonising tribes, and it is only towards the later Anglo-Saxon period that these can be considered to have constituted a single national language.&lt;ref name=OriginOfAngloSaxon&gt;{{Citation |last=Shore |first=Thomas William |author-link=Thomas William Shore |title=[[commons:File:Shore T.

The four main dialectal forms of Old English were [[Mercian (Old English)|Mercian]], [[Northumbrian (Old English)|Northumbrian]], [[Kentish (Old English)|Kentish]], and [[West Saxon (Old English)|West Saxon]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Campbell |first=Alistair |authorlink=Alistair Campbell (academic)|title=Old English Grammar |place=Oxford |publisher=[[Oxford University Press]] |year=1959 |isbn=0-19-811943-7 |page=4}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mercian and Northumbrian are together referred to as ''Anglian''. In terms of geography the Northumbrian region lay north of the Humber River; the Mercian lay north of the Thames and South of the Humber River; West Saxon lay south and southwest of the Thames; and the smallest, Kentish region lay southeast of the Thames, a small corner of England. The Kentish region, settled by the Jutes from Jutland, has the scantiest literary remains.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

Each of these four dialects was associated with an independent kingdom on the island. Of these, Northumbria south of the [[River Tyne|Tyne]], and most of [[Mercia]], were [[Viking invasion of Britain|overrun by the Vikings]] during the 9th century. The portion of Mercia that was successfully defended, and all of [[Kingdom of Kent|Kent]], were then integrated into Wessex under [[Alfred the Great]].
From that time on, the West Saxon dialect (then in the form now known as Early West Saxon) became standardised as the language of government, and as the basis for the many works of literature and religious materials produced or translated from Latin in that period.

The later literary standard known as Late West Saxon (see [[#History|History]], above), although centred in the same region of the country, appears not to have been directly descended from Alfred's Early West Saxon. For example, the former [[diphthong]] {{IPA|/iy/}} tended to become monophthongised to {{IPA|/i/}} in EWS, but to {{IPA|/y/}} in LWS.&lt;ref&gt;Hogg (1992), p. 117; but for a different interpretation of this, see [[Old English phonology#Diphthongs|Old English diphthongs]].&lt;/ref&gt;

Due to the centralisation of power and the Viking invasions, there is relatively little written record of the non-Wessex dialects after Alfred's unification. Some Mercian texts continued to be written, however, and the influence of Mercian is apparent in some of the translations produced under Alfred's programme, many of which were produced by Mercian scholars.&lt;ref&gt;Magennis (2011), pp. 56–60.&lt;/ref&gt; Other dialects certainly continued to be spoken, as is evidenced by the continued variation between their successors in Middle and Modern English. In fact, what would become the standard forms of Middle English and of Modern English are descended from Mercian rather than West Saxon, while [[Scots language|Scots]] developed from the Northumbrian dialect. It was once claimed that, owing to its position at the heart of the Kingdom of Wessex, the relics of Anglo-Saxon accent, idiom and vocabulary were best preserved in the [[West Country dialects#History and origins|dialect of Somerset]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.org/details/somersetshiredi00bayngoog The Somersetshire dialect: its pronunciation, 2 papers (1861)] Thomas Spencer Baynes, first published 1855 &amp; 1856&lt;/ref&gt;

==Influence of other languages==
{{further|Celtic influence in English|Latin influence in English|Scandinavian influence in English}}
The language of the Anglo-Saxon settlers appears not to have been significantly affected by the native [[British Celtic languages]] which it [[Celtic language-death in England|largely displaced]]. The number of Celtic [[loanwords]] introduced into the language is very small. However, various suggestions have been made concerning possible influence that Celtic may have had on developments in English [[syntax]] in the post-Old English period, such as the regular [[progressive aspect|progressive]] construction and [[Analytic language|analytic word order]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.rotary-munich.de/2005-2006/theo-vennemann.pdf |title=Rotary-munich.de |format=PDF |accessdate=20 June 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090327012738/http://www.rotary-munich.de/2005-2006/theo-vennemann.pdf |archivedate=27 March 2009 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as the eventual development of the periphrastic auxiliary verb "do".

Old English contained a certain number of loanwords from [[Latin]], which was the scholarly and diplomatic ''[[lingua franca]]'' of Western Europe. It is sometimes possible to give approximate dates for the borrowing of individual Latin words based on which patterns of sound change they have undergone. Some Latin words had already been borrowed into the Germanic languages before the ancestral [[Angles]] and [[Saxon people|Saxons]] left continental Europe for Britain. More entered the language when the Anglo-Saxons were [[Christianization of England|converted to Christianity]] and Latin-speaking priests became influential. It was also through Irish Christian missionaries that the [[Latin alphabet]] was introduced and adapted for the [[#Orthography|writing of Old English]], replacing the earlier runic system. Nonetheless, the largest transfer of Latin-based (mainly [[Old French]]) words into English occurred after the [[Norman Conquest]] of 1066, and thus in the [[Middle English]] rather than the Old English period.

Another source of loanwords was [[Old Norse]], which came into contact with Old English via the Scandinavian rulers and settlers in the [[Danelaw]] from the late 9th century, and during the rule of [[Cnut]] and other Danish kings in the early 11th century. Many [[toponym|place-names]] in eastern and northern England are of Scandinavian origin. Norse borrowings are relatively rare in Old English literature, being mostly terms relating to government and administration. The literary standard, however, was based on the [[West Saxon dialect]], away from the main area of Scandinavian influence; the impact of Norse may have been greater in the eastern and northern dialects. Certainly in [[Middle English]] texts, which are more often based on eastern dialects, a strong Norse influence becomes apparent. Modern English contains a great many, often everyday, words that were borrowed from Old Norse, and the grammatical simplification that occurred after the Old English period is also often attributed to Norse influence.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite book|title = A History of the English Language|last = Baugh|first = Albert|publisher = Routledge &amp; Kegan Paul|year = 1951|isbn = |location = London|pages = 60–83; 110–130 (Scandinavian influence).}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Shay2008"&gt;{{cite book |last=Scott |first=Shay |title=The history of English: a linguistic introduction |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=1vj0-f_U1SQC&amp;pg=PA86 |accessdate=29 January 2012 |date=30 January 2008 |publisher=Wardja Press |isbn=978-0-615-16817-3 |page=86}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite book|title = Growth and Structure of the English Language|last = Jespersen|first = Otto|publisher = B.

The influence of Old Norse certainly helped move English from a [[synthetic language]] along the continuum to a more [[Analytic language|analytic word order]], and [[Old Norse]] most likely made a greater impact on the English language than any other language.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-OiNxknXdY|title = [BBC World News] BBC Documentary English Birth of a Language - 35:00 to 37:20|date = 27 December 2014|accessdate = 4 January 2016|website = |publisher = BBC|last = BBC World News|first = }}&lt;/ref&gt; The eagerness of [[Vikings]] in the Danelaw to communicate with their southern Anglo-Saxon neighbours produced a friction that led to the erosion of the complicated inflectional word-endings.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = The Cambridge Encyclopedia of the English Language|last = Crystal|first = David|publisher = Cambridge University Press|year = 1995|isbn = |location = Cambridge, UK|pages = 32}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title = The Story of English|last = McCrum|first = Robert|publisher = Faber and Faber|year = 1987|isbn = |location = London|pages = 70–71}}&lt;/ref&gt; Simeon Potter notes: "No less far-reaching was the influence of Scandinavian upon the inflexional endings of English in hastening that wearing away and leveling of grammatical forms which gradually spread from north to south. It was, after all, a salutary influence. The gain was greater than the loss. There was a gain in directness, in clarity, and in strength."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Our Language|last = Potter|first = Simeon|publisher = Penguin Books Ltd.|year = 1950|isbn = |location = Harmondsworth, Middlesex, England|pages = 33}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The strength of the Viking influence on Old English appears from the fact that the indispensable elements of the language – pronouns, modals, comparatives, pronominal adverbs (like "hence" and "together"), conjunctions and prepositions – show the most marked Danish influence; the best evidence of Scandinavian influence appears in the extensive word borrowings for, as Jespersen indicates, no texts exist in either Scandinavia or in Northern England from this time to give certain evidence of an influence on syntax. The change to Old English from Old Norse was substantive, pervasive, and of a democratic character.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Old Norse and Old English resembled each other closely like cousins and with some words in common, they roughly understood each other;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; in time the inflections melted away and the analytic pattern emerged.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adngAZ2iuRc|title = 121028 Charlene Lohmeier "Evolution of the English Language" - 23:40 - 25:00; 30:20 - 30:45; 45:00 - 46:00|date = 28 October 2012|access-date = |website = 121028 Charlene Lohmeier "Evolution of the English Language"|publisher = Dutch Lichliter|last = Lohmeier|first = Charlene}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is most "important to recognize that in many words the English and Scandinavian language differed chiefly in their inflectional elements. The body of the word was so nearly the same in the two languages that only the endings would put obstacles in the way of mutual understanding. In the mixed population which existed in the Danelaw these endings must have led to much confusion, tending gradually to become obscured and finally lost." This blending of peoples and languages resulted in "simplifying English grammar".&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

The sounds enclosed in parentheses in the chart above are not considered to be [[phoneme]]s:
*{{IPA|[dʒ]}} is an [[allophone]] of {{IPA|/j/}} occurring after {{IPA|/n/}} and when [[gemination|geminated]] (doubled).
*{{IPA|[ŋ]}} is an allophone of {{IPA|/n/}} occurring before {{IPA|/k/}} and {{IPA|/ɡ/}}.
*{{IPA|[v, ð, z]}} are voiced allophones of {{IPA|/f, θ, s/}} respectively, occurring between [[vowel]]s or [[voiced consonant]]s.
*{{IPA|[ç, x]}} are allophones of {{IPA|/h/}} occurring in [[syllable coda|coda]] position after front and back vowels respectively.
*{{IPA|[ɣ]}} is an allophone of {{IPA|/ɡ/}} occurring after a vowel, and, at an earlier stage of the language, in the syllable onset.
*the [[Sonorant#Voiceless|voiceless sonorants]] {{IPA|[ʍ, l̥, n̥, r̥]}} are analysed as realizing the sequences {{IPA|/hw, hl, hn, hr/}}.

The above system is largely similar to [[English phonology#Consonants|that of Modern English]], except that {{IPA|[ç, x, ɣ, l̥, n̥, r̥]}} (and {{IPA|[ʍ]}} for [[English wh|most speakers]]) have generally been lost, while the voiced affricate and fricatives (now also including {{IPA|/ʒ/}}) have become independent phonemes, as has {{IPA|/ŋ/}}.

The mid front rounded vowels {{IPA|/ø(ː)/}} had merged into unrounded {{IPA|/e(ː)/}} before the Late West Saxon period. During the 11th century such vowels arose again, as monophthongisations of the diphthongs {{IPA|/e(ː)o/}}, but quickly merged again with {{IPA|/e(ː)/}} in most dialects.&lt;ref&gt;Blake (1992), pp. 42–43.&lt;/ref&gt;

The exact pronunciation of the West Saxon close diphthongs, spelt {{angbr|{{lang|ang|ie}}}}, is disputed; it may have been {{IPA|/i(ː)y/ or /i(ː)e/}}. Other dialects may have had different systems of diphthongs; for example, Anglian dialects retained {{IPA|/i(ː)u/}}, which had merged with {{IPA|/e(ː)o/}} in West Saxon.

===Sound changes===
{{Main|Phonological history of Old English}}
Some of the principal [[sound change]]s occurring in the pre-history and history of Old English were the following:
*Fronting of {{IPA|[ɑ(ː)]}} to {{IPA|[æ(ː)]}} except when [[nasal vowel|nasalised]] or followed by a [[nasal consonant]] ("Anglo-Frisian brightening"), partly reversed in certain positions by later "a-restoration" or retraction.
*Monophthongisation of the diphthong {{IPA|[ai]}}, and modification of remaining diphthongs to the [[height-harmonic]] type.
*Diphthongisation of long and short front vowels in certain positions ("breaking").
*Palatalisation of velars {{IPA|[k], [ɡ], [ɣ], [sk]}} to {{IPA|[tʃ], [dʒ], [j], [ʃ]}} in certain front-vowel environments.
*The process known as [[Germanic umlaut#I-mutation in Old English|i-mutation]] (which for example led to modern ''mice'' as the plural of ''mouse'').
*Loss of certain weak vowels in word-final and medial positions, and of medial [(i)j]; reduction of remaining unstressed vowels. 
*Diphthongisation of certain vowels before certain consonants when preceding a back vowel ("back mutation").
*Loss of /h/ between vowels or between a voiced consonant and a vowel, with lengthening of the preceding vowel.
*Collapse of two consecutive vowels into a single vowel.
*"Palatal umlaut", which has given forms such as ''six'' (compare German ''sechs'').

For more details of these processes, see the main article, linked above. For sound changes before and after the Old English period, see [[Phonological history of English]].

==Grammar==
{{Main|Old English grammar}}

===Morphology===
[[Noun]]s [[declension|decline]] for five [[grammatical case|cases]]: [[nominative case|nominative]], [[accusative case|accusative]], [[genitive case|genitive]], [[dative case|dative]], [[instrumental case|instrumental]]; three [[grammatical gender|genders]]: masculine, feminine, neuter; and two [[grammatical number|numbers]]: singular, and plural; and are strong or weak. The instrumental is vestigial and only used with the masculine and neuter singular and often replaced by the [[dative case|dative]]. Only [[pronoun]]s and strong adjectives retain separate [[instrumental case|instrumental]] forms. There is also sparse early Northumbrian evidence of a sixth case: the [[locative case|locative]]. Adjectives agree with nouns in case, gender, number, and strong, or weak forms. [[pronoun|Pronouns]] and sometimes [[participle]]s agree in case, gender, and number. First-person and second-[[grammatical person|person]] [[personal pronoun]]s occasionally distinguish [[dual (grammatical number)|dual-number]] forms. The [[article (grammar)#Definite article|definite article]] {{lang|ang|sē}} and its [[inflection]]s serve as a [[article (grammar)#Definite article|definite article]] ("the"), a [[demonstrative adjective]] ("that"), and [[Pronoun#Demonstrative|demonstrative pronoun]]. Other [[demonstrative]]s are {{lang|ang|þes}} ("this"), and {{lang|ang|ġeon}} ("yon"). These words [[inflection|inflect]] for case, gender, number. Adjectives have both strong and weak sets of endings, weak ones being used when a definite or possessive [[determiner]] is also present.

Verbs [[Grammatical conjugation|conjugate]] for three [[grammatical person|persons]]: first, second, and third; two numbers: singular, plural; two [[grammatical tense|tenses]]: present, and past; three [[grammatical mood|moods]]: [[grammatical mood#indicative|indicative]], [[subjunctive mood|subjunctive]], and [[imperative mood|imperative]];&lt;ref name="Continuum"&gt;{{cite web|title=Continuum Encyclopedia of British Literature|url=http://www.credoreference.com/entry/britlit/old_english|publisher=Continuum}}&lt;/ref&gt; and are strong (exhibiting ablaut) or weak (exhibiting a dental suffix). Verbs have two [[infinitive]] forms: bare, and bound; and two [[participle]]s: present, and past. The subjunctive has past and present forms. Finite verbs agree with [[subject (grammar)|subjects]] in person, and number. The [[future tense]], [[passive voice]], and other [[grammatical aspect|aspects]] are formed with compounds.
[[Preposition and postposition|Adpositions]] are mostly before but often after their object. If the [[object (grammar)|object]] of an adposition is marked in the dative case, an adposition may conceivably be located anywhere in the sentence.

Remnants of the Old English case system in Modern English are in the [[English personal pronouns|forms of a few pronouns]] (such as ''I/me/mine'', ''she/her'', [[Who (pronoun)|''who/whom/whose'']]) and in the [[English possessive|possessive]] ending ''-'s'', which derives from the masculine and neuter genitive ending ''-es''. The modern [[English plural]] ending ''-(e)s'' derives from the Old English ''-as'', but the latter applied only to "strong" masculine nouns in the nominative and accusative cases; different plural endings were used in other instances. Old English nouns had [[grammatical gender]], while modern English has only natural gender. Pronoun usage could reflect either natural or grammatical gender when those conflicted, as in the case of {{lang|ang|ƿīf}}, a neuter noun referring to a female person.

In Old English's verbal compound constructions are the beginnings of the [[Uses of English verb forms|compound tenses of Modern English]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Mitchell |first1=Bruce |last2=Robinson |first2=Fred C |year=2002 |title=A Guide to Old English |place=Oxford |publisher=Blackwell Publishing |pages=109–112}}&lt;/ref&gt; Old English verbs include [[Germanic strong verb|strong verbs]], which form the past tense by altering the root vowel, and [[Germanic weak verb|weak verbs]], which use a suffix such as {{lang|ang|-de}}.&lt;ref name="Continuum"/&gt; As in Modern English, and peculiar to the Germanic languages, the verbs formed two great classes: weak (regular), and strong (irregular). Like today, Old English had fewer strong verbs, and many of these have over time decayed into weak forms. Then, as now, dental suffixes indicated the past tense of the weak verbs, as in ''work'' and ''worked''.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

===Syntax===
Old English [[syntax]] is similar to [[English grammar|that of modern English]]. Some differences are consequences of the greater level of nominal and verbal inflection, allowing freer [[word order]].
*Default word order is [[verb-second]] in [[independent clause|main clauses]], and verb-final in [[subordinate clause|subordinate clauses]], being more like modern [[German language|German]] than modern English.
*No [[do-support|''do''-support]] in questions and negatives. Questions were usually formed by [[inversion (linguistics)|inverting]] [[subject (grammar)|subject]] and [[finite verb]], and negatives by placing ''ne'' before the finite verb, regardless what verb. 
*Multiple negatives can stack up in a sentence intensifying each other ([[negative concord]]).
*Sentences with subordinate clauses of the type "when X, Y" (e.g. "When I got home, I ate dinner") don't use a ''wh-''type conjunction, but rather a ''th-''type [[correlative conjunction]] such as {{lang|ang|þā}}, otherwise meaning "then" (e.g. {{lang|ang|þā X, þā Y}} in place of "when X, Y"). The ''wh-''words are used only as [[interrogative]]s and as [[indefinite pronouns]].
*Similarly, ''wh-'' forms were not used as [[relative pronoun]]s. Instead, the indeclinable word {{lang|ang|þe}} is used, often preceded by (or replaced by) the appropriate form of the article/demonstrative {{lang|ang|se}}.

==Orthography==
{{Anchor|alphabet}}
{{Main|Anglo-Saxon runes|Old English Latin alphabet}}
[[File:Anglosaxonrunes.svg|upright=1.13|thumb|The [[runic alphabet]] used to write Old English before the introduction of the [[Latin alphabet]]]]

Old English was first written in [[runic alphabet|runes]], using the [[Anglo-Saxon runes|futhorc]] – a rune set derived from the Germanic 24-character [[elder futhark]], extended by five more runes used to represent Anglo-Saxon vowel sounds, and sometimes by several more additional characters. From around the 9th century, the runic system came to be supplanted by a (minuscule) [[half-uncial]] script of the [[Latin alphabet]] introduced by [[Celtic Christianity|Irish Christian]] missionaries.&lt;ref name="Cambridge"&gt;{{cite book |last=Crystal |first=David |year=1987 |title=The Cambridge Encyclopedia of Language |publisher=Cambridge University Press |isbn=0-521-26438-3 |page=203}}&lt;/ref&gt; This was replaced by [[insular script]], a cursive and pointed version of the half-uncial script. This was used until the end of the 12th century when continental [[Carolingian minuscule]] (also known as ''Caroline'') replaced the insular.

The Latin alphabet of the time still lacked the letters {{angbr|j}} and {{angbr|w}}, and there was no {{angbr|v}} as distinct from {{angbr|u}}; moreover native Old English spellings did not use {{angbr|k}}, {{angbr|q}} or {{angbr|z}}. The remaining 20 Latin letters were supplemented by four more: {{angbr|[[æ]]}} ({{lang|ang|æsc}}, modern ''ash'') and {{angbr|{{lang|ang|ð}}}} ({{lang|ang|ðæt}}, now called [[eth (letter)|eth]] or edh), which were modified Latin letters, and [[thorn (letter)|thorn]] {{angle bracket|{{lang|ang|þ}}}} and [[wynn]] {{angle bracket|{{lang|ang|ƿ}}}}, which are borrowings from the futhorc. A few letter pairs were used as [[digraph (orthography)|digraph]]s, representing a single sound. Also used was the [[Tironian note]] {{angle bracket|{{lang|ang|⁊}}}} (a character similar to the digit 7) for the [[Grammatical conjunction|conjunction]] ''and'', and a [[thorn with stroke|thorn with a crossbar through the ascender]] for the pronoun {{lang|ang|þæt}}. [[Macron (diacritic)|Macron]]s over vowels were originally used not to mark long vowels (as in modern editions), but to indicate stress,&lt;ref&gt;C.M. Millward, Mary Hayes, ''A Biography of the English Language'', Cengage Learning 2011, p. 96.&lt;/ref&gt; or as abbreviations for a following ''m'' or ''n''.&lt;ref&gt;Stephen Pollington, ''First Steps in Old English'', Anglo-Saxon Books 1997, p. 138.&lt;/ref&gt;

Modern editions of Old English manuscripts generally introduce some additional conventions. The modern forms of Latin letters are used, including {{angbr|g}} in place of the [[insular G]], {{angle bracket|s}} for [[long S]], and others which may differ considerably from the insular script, notably {{angbr|e}}, {{angbr|f}} and {{angbr|r}}. Macrons are used to indicate long vowels, where usually no distinction was made between long and short vowels in the originals. (In some older editions an [[acute accent]] mark was used for consistency with Old Norse conventions.) Additionally, modern editions often distinguish between [[velar consonant|velar]] and [[palatal consonant|palatal]] {{angle bracket|{{lang|ang|c}}}} and {{angle bracket|{{lang|ang|g}}}} by placing dots above the palatals: {{angle bracket|{{lang|ang|ċ}}}}, {{angle bracket|{{lang|ang|ġ}}}}. The letter wynn {{angle bracket|{{lang|ang|ƿ}}}} is usually replaced with {{angle bracket|{{lang|ang|w}}}}, but {{lang|ang|æsc}}, eth and thorn are normally retained (except when eth is replaced by thorn).

In contrast with [[English orthography|Modern English orthography]], that of Old English was reasonably [[regular spelling|regular]], with a mostly predictable correspondence between letters and [[phoneme]]s. There were not usually any [[silent letter]]s—in the word ''cniht'', for example, both the {{angbr|c}} and {{angbr|h}} were pronounced, unlike the {{angbr|k}} and {{angbr|gh}} in the modern ''knight''. The following table lists the Old English letters and digraphs together with the phonemes they represent, using the same notation as in the [[#Phonology|Phonology]] section above.

! {{lang|ang|a}}
| {{IPA|/ɑ/}}, {{IPA|/ɑː/}}
| Spelling variations like {{angle bracket|land}} ~ {{angle bracket|lond}} ("land") suggest the short vowel may have had a rounded [[allophone]] {{IPA|[ɒ]}} before {{IPA|[n]}} in some cases.

| Formerly the [[digraph (orthography)|digraph]] {{angle bracket|ae}} was used; {{angle bracket|æ}} became more common during the 8th century, and was standard after 800. In 9th-century Kentish manuscripts, a form of {{angle bracket|æ}} that was missing the upper hook of the {{angle bracket|a}} part was used; it is not clear whether this represented {{IPA|/æ/}} or {{IPA|/e/}}. See also '''ę'''.

| {{IPA|/tʃ/}}
| The {{IPA|/tʃ/}} pronunciation is sometimes written with a [[diacritic]] by modern editors: most commonly {{angle bracket|{{lang|ang|ċ}}}}, sometimes {{angle bracket|č}} or {{angle bracket|ç}}. Before a consonant letter the pronunciation is always {{IPA|/k/}}; word-finally after {{angle bracket|i}} it is always {{IPA|/tʃ/}}. Otherwise, a knowledge of the [[historical linguistics|history]] of the word is needed to predict the pronunciation with certainty, although it is most commonly {{IPA|/tʃ/}} before [[front vowel]]s (other than {{IPA|[y]}}) and {{IPA|/k/}} elsewhere.

Eth was first attested (in definitely dated materials) in the 7th century, and thorn in the 8th. Eth was more common than thorn before [[Alfred the Great|Alfred]]'s time. From then onward, thorn was used increasingly often at the start of words, while eth was normal in the middle and at the end of words, although usage varied in both cases.

|-
! {{lang|ang|ƿ}}
| {{IPA|/w/}}
| Called [[wynn]] and derived from the rune of the same name. In earlier texts by continental scribes, and also later in the north, /w/ was represented by {{angbr|u}} or {{angbr|uu}}. In modern editions, wynn is replaced by {{angle bracket|w}}, to prevent confusion with {{angle bracket|p}}.

{{Main|Old English literature}}

Old English literature, though more abundant than literature of the continent before [[Anno Domini|AD]] 1000,{{citation needed|date=August 2012}}&lt;!--More than the entire "continent" as a whole? Or than any other single "country" (France, Germany, Italy) in Western and Central Europe at the time? Including only literature in the vernaculars - or also in Latin?--&gt; is nonetheless scant. The pagan and Christian streams mingle in Old English, one of the richest and most significant bodies of literature preserved among the early Germanic peoples.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; In his supplementary article to the 1935 posthumous edition of Bright's ''Anglo-Saxon Reader'', Dr. James Hulbert writes:

{{quote|In such historical conditions, an incalculable amount of the writings of the Anglo-Saxon period perished. What they contained, how important they were for an understanding of literature before the Conquest, we have no means of knowing: the scant catalogues of monastic libraries do not help us, and there are no references in extant works to other compositions....How incomplete our materials are can be illustrated by the well-known fact that, with few and relatively unimportant exceptions, all extant Anglo-Saxon poetry is preserved in four manuscripts.}}

Some of the most important surviving works of Old English literature are ''[[Beowulf]]'', an [[epic poem]]; the ''[[Anglo-Saxon Chronicle]]'', a record of early English history; the [[Franks Casket]], an inscribed early whalebone artefact; and [[Cædmon's Hymn]], a Christian religious poem. There are also a number of extant prose works, such as sermons and saints' lives, biblical translations, and translated Latin works of the early Church Fathers, legal documents, such as laws and wills, and practical works on grammar, medicine, and geography. Still, poetry is considered the heart of Old English literature. Nearly all Anglo-Saxon authors are anonymous, with a few exceptions, such as [[Bede]] and [[Cædmon]]. Cædmon, the earliest English poet we know by name, served as a lay brother in the monastery at Whitby.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

===''Beowulf''===
The first example is taken from the opening lines of the folk-epic ''[[Beowulf]]'', a poem of some 3,000 lines and the single greatest work of Old English.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; This passage describes how [[Hrothgar]]'s legendary ancestor [[Scyld]] was found as a baby, washed ashore, and adopted by a noble family. The translation is literal and represents the original poetic word order. As such, it is not typical of Old English prose. The modern cognates of original words have been used whenever practical to give a close approximation of the feel of the original poem.

The words in brackets are implied in the Old English by noun case and the bold words in brackets are explanations of words that have slightly different meanings in a modern context. Notice how ''what'' is used by the poet where a word like ''lo'' or ''behold'' would be expected. This usage is similar to ''what-ho!'', both an expression of surprise and a call to attention.

English poetry is based on stress and alliteration. In alliteration, the first consonant in a word alliterates with the same consonant at the beginning of another word, as with {{lang|ang|'''G'''ār-Dena}} and {{lang|ang|'''ġ'''eār-dagum}}. Vowels alliterate with any other vowel, as with {{lang|ang|'''æ'''þelingas}} and {{lang|ang|'''e'''llen}}. In the text below, the letters that alliterate are bolded.

A semi-fluent translation in Modern English would be:

Lo! We have heard of majesty of the Spear-Danes, of those nation-kings in the days of yore, and how those noblemen promoted zeal. Scyld Scefing took away mead-benches from bands of enemies, from many tribes; he terrified earls. Since he was first found destitute (he gained consolation for that) he grew under the heavens, prospered in honours, until each of those who lived around him over the sea had to obey him, give him tribute. That was a good king!

==Dictionaries==
===Early history===
The earliest history of Old English [[lexicography]] lies in the [[Anglo-Saxon England|Anglo-Saxon]] period itself, when English-speaking scholars created English [[Gloss (annotation)|glosses]] on [[Latin language|Latin]] texts. At first these were often [[marginalia|marginal]] or [[interlinear gloss|interlinear]] glosses, but soon came to be gathered into word-lists such as the [[Épinal-Erfurt glossary|Épinal-Erfurt]], [[Leiden Glossary|Leiden]] and [[Corpus Glossary|Corpus]] Glossaries. Over time, these word-lists were consolidated and alphabeticised to create extensive Latin-Old English glossaries with some of the character of [[dictionary|dictionaries]], such as the [[Cleopatra Glossaries]], the [[Harley Glossary]] and the [[Brussels Glossary]].&lt;ref&gt;Patrizia Lendinara, ‘Anglo-Saxon Glosses and Glossaries: An Introduction’, in Anglo-Saxon Glosses and Glossaries (Aldershot: Variorum, 1999), pp. 1–26.&lt;/ref&gt; In some cases, the material in these glossaries continued to be circulated and updated in [[Middle English]] glossaries, such as the [[Durham Plant-Name Glossary]] and the [[Laud Herbal Glossary]].&lt;ref&gt;''Das Durhamer Pflanzenglossar: lateinisch und altenglish'', ed. by Bogislav von Lindheim, Beiträge zur englischen Philologie, 35 (Bochum-Langendreer: Poppinghaus, 1941).&lt;/ref&gt;

Old English lexicography was revived in the early modern period, drawing heavily on Anglo-Saxons' own glossaries. The major publication at this time was [[William Somner]]'s ''Dictionarium Saxonico-Latino-Anglicum''.&lt;ref&gt;William Somner, ''Dictionarium Saxonico-Latino-Anglicum'', English Linguistics 1500–1800 (A Collection of Facsimile Reprints), 247 (Menston: The Scholar Press, 1970).&lt;/ref&gt; The next substantial Old English dictionary was [[Joseph Bosworth]]'s ''Anglo-Saxon Dictionary'' of 1838.

===Modern===
In modern scholarship, the following dictionaries remain current:

* [[Angus Cameron (academic)|Cameron, Angus]], et al. (ed.) (1983-). ''[[Dictionary of Old English]]''. Toronto: Published for the Dictionary of Old English Project, Centre for Medieval Studies, University of Toronto by the Pontifical Institute of Medieval Studies. Initially issued on microfiche and subsequently as a CD-ROM, the dictionary is now primarily published online at [https://www.doe.utoronto.ca https://www.doe.utoronto.ca]. This generally supersedes previous dictionaries where available. As of September 2018, the dictionary covered A-I.
* [[Joseph Bosworth|Bosworth, Joseph]] and [[T. Northcote Toller]]. (1898). ''[[An Anglo-Saxon Dictionary]]''. Oxford: Clarendon Press. The main research dictionary for Old English, unless superseded by the ''Dictionary of Old English''. Various digitisations are available open-access, including at [http://bosworth.ff.cuni.cz/ http://bosworth.ff.cuni.cz/]. Due to errors and omissions in the 1898 publication, this needs to be read in conjunction with:
** T. Northcote Toller. (1921). ''An Anglo-Saxon Dictionary: Supplement''. Oxford: Clarendon Press.
** Alistair Campbell (1972). ''An Anglo-Saxon Dictionary: Enlarged addenda and corrigenda''. Oxford: Clarendon Press.
* [[Clark Hall, J. R.]]. (1969). ''A Concise Anglo-Saxon Dictionary''. 4th rev. edn by Herbet D. Meritt. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press. Occasionally more accurate than Bosworth-Toller, and widely used as a reading dictionary. Various digitisations are available, including [https://www.ling.upenn.edu/~kurisuto/germanic/oe_clarkhall_about.html here].
* Roberts, Jane and [[Christian Kay]], with Lynne Grundy, ''A Thesaurus of Old English in Two Volumes'', Costerus New Series, 131–32, 2nd rev. impression, 2 vols (Amsterdam: Rodopi, 2000), also available [https://oldenglishthesaurus.arts.gla.ac.uk/ online]. A thesaurus based on the definitions in Bosworth-Toller and the structure of ''[[Roget's Thesaurus]]''.

Though focused on later periods, the ''[[Oxford English Dictionary]]'', ''[[Middle English Dictionary]]'', ''[[Dictionary of the Older Scottish Tongue]]'', and ''[[Historical Thesaurus of English]]'' all also include material relevant to Old English.

==Revivals==
Like other historical languages, Old English has been used by scholars and enthusiasts of later periods to create texts either imitating Anglo-Saxon literature or deliberately transferring it to a different cultural context. Examples include [[Alistair Campbell (academic)|Alistair Campbell]] and [[J. R. R. Tolkien]].&lt;ref&gt;Robinson, Fred C. ‘The Afterlife of Old English’. ''The Tomb of Beowulf and Other Essays on Old English''. Oxford: Blackwell, 1993. 275-303.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Ransom Riggs]] uses several Old English words, such as syndrigast(singular, peculia), ymbryne(period, cycle), etc., dubbed as "Old Peculiar" ones.

A number of websites devoted to [[Modern Paganism]] and [[historical reenactment]] offer reference material and forums promoting the active use of Old English. There is also an [[:ang:Hēafodtramet|Old English version of Wikipedia]]. However, one investigation found that many Neo-Old English texts published online bear little resemblance to the historical language and have many basic grammatical mistakes.&lt;ref&gt;Christina Neuland and Florian Schleburg. (2014). "A New Old English? The Chances of an Anglo-Saxon Revival on the Internet". In: S. Buschfeld et al. (Eds.), ''The Evolution of Englishes. The Dynamic Model and Beyond'' (pp. 486–504). Amsterdam: John Benjamins.&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[semiotic]] analysis (the studies of signs or symbols), an '''open text''' is a text that allows multiple or mediated [[Hermeneutics|interpretation]] by the readers.  In contrast, a closed text leads the reader to one intended interpretation.

The concept of the '''open text''' comes from [[Umberto Eco]]'s collection of essays ''The Role of the Reader'',&lt;ref&gt;Eco, U., 1984,The Role of the Reader: Explorations in the Semiotics of Texts, Indiana University Press, {{ISBN|0-253-20318-X}}&lt;/ref&gt; but it is also derivative of [[Roland Barthes]]'s distinction between 'readerly' (lisible) and 'writerly' (scriptible) texts as set out in his 1968 essay, "[[The Death of the Author]]".&lt;ref&gt;Barthes, R., 1977, 'The Death of the Author' in Image-Music-Text, Fontana&lt;/ref&gt;

== Content ==
{{refimprove|date=November 2018}}
In this essay, [[Umberto Eco]] describes a special kind of musical works that can be organized and re-organized by the performers before they are played to the audience. He then applied this idea of "open works" to literary texts and other works of art.

Every work of art can be read, according to Eco, in three distinct ways: the moral, the allegorical and the [[Anagoge|anagogical]]. Each is not only distinct but can be fully anticipated and directed by the author (or the artist) of the work. An example of this kind of reading is found in the stories by [[Franz Kafka|Kafka]], in which his symbolic actions cannot be read in one definitive way; each reading will end up with similar and multiple meanings.

The reader will read a certain work differently every time, depending on his/her emotional state, physical state and political world view. We can find an example of this in plays written by [[Bertolt Brecht|Brecht]] , which are "open" in the same way that an argument between two people is open: both sides (the actors and the viewers) want and anticipate a solution at the end, but no solution ever comes, leaving us to wander to find meaning.

[[Umberto Eco]] makes a distinction between these kind of works, which are "open" in their interpretation, to the musical works from the beginning, which are open in their structural sense. These kind of "openness" is not only for musical works, it might be any kind of artistic work (painting, poem, performance etc.)

This kind of "openness" is derived from the science of the time, he says. When people believed in a [[Geocentric model|geocentric]] world, they expected every work of art to have only one definitive interpretation, but as people found out about the universe and the magnitude of stars in the sky and their hierarchy, they began to expect more ideas to be interpreted from every work.

He continues by comparing open works to [[Quantum mechanics]], and he arrives at the conclusion that open works are more like [[Albert Einstein|Einstein]]'s idea of the universe, which is governed by precise laws but seems random at first. The artist in those open works arranges  the work carefully so it could be re-organized by another but still keep the original voice or intent of the artist.

Every work can be read in infinite ways, depending on an individual's state of mind and perspective, and it also depends on a third person intervention, either the players of the orchestra or the curator at the museum. Eco understand the difficulties with this perspective, but he ends by saying that this article, as all works, is still a "work in movement", an "open work" and still a "work in progress".

'''Paule du Bouchet''' (born on 19 April 1951) is a French writer, novelist and author of several books for youth. She is currently in charge of the Music Department of [[Gallimard Jeunesse]].&lt;ref name=Paule&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.gallimard.fr/Contributeurs/Paule-Du-Bouchet |title=PAULE DU BOUCHET |author=&lt;!--Not stated--&gt; |date=2004-05-18 |website=[[Éditions Gallimard]] |publisher= |accessdate=2018-01-27 |language=fr}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Career ==
Paule du Bouchet was born on 19 April 1951, daughter of [[André du Bouchet]] and {{ill|Tina Jolas|fr}}, Tina left the poet André and 6-year-old Paule for another poet [[René Char]] in 1957.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.lemonde.fr/livres/article/2011/05/05/emportee-de-paule-du-bouchet_1517173_3260.html |title="Emportée", de Paule du Bouchet : pour l'amour d'une mère... |last=Cahen |first=Didier |authorlink=Didier Cahen |date=2011-05-05 |website=[[Le Monde]] |publisher= |accessdate=2018-01-27 |language=fr}}&lt;/ref&gt;

She is passionate about music and pianist. Before working in book publishing, she studied philosophy and music, then she taught philosophy and gave musical training to children. She has been a journalist of the French magazine ''{{ill|Okapi (magazine)|lt=Okapi|fr|Okapi (magazine)}}'' ([[Bayard Presse]]) from 1978 to 1985.&lt;ref name=Picasso&gt;{{cite book |last1=Bernadac |first1=Marie-Laure |last2=Du Bouchet |first2=Paule |translator-last=Jarrín Rodríguez |translator-first=Teresa |date=2011 |title=Picasso: Genialidad en el arte |series=Coll. “[[Biblioteca Ilustrada]]” |volume=8 |url=https://books.google.com/books/about/Picasso.html?id=L-SYZwEACAAJ |location=Barcelona |publisher=Blume Naturart |page=10 |isbn=978-84-8076-934-1 |language=es-ES |quote=About the authors}}&lt;/ref&gt; Later she turned her career towards publishing and youth literature. She has written many novels, including ''{{ill|Chante, Luna|fr}}'' in 2004, {{lang|fr|Le journal d’Adèle|italic=yes}} in 2007, {{lang|fr|À la vie à la mort}}, {{lang|fr|Comme un ours en cage}}, et cetera. She currently has published more than 40 works at [[Éditions Gallimard]] and is director of “{{lang|fr|Écoutez lire|italic=no}}” since 2004, a collection of [[audiobooks]] produced by Gallimard.&lt;ref name=Paule /&gt; She was also responsible for the {{lang|fr|Musique}} series of “[[Découvertes Gallimard]]” [[Collection (publishing)|collection]], and was its editor from 1984 to 1996.&lt;ref name=Picasso /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.babelio.com/auteur/Paule-du-Bouchet/27086 |title=Paule du Bouchet |date= |website={{ill|Babelio|fr}} |publisher= |accessdate=2018-01-28 |language=fr}}&lt;/ref&gt; Her book {{lang|fr|Picasso : Le sage et le fou}}, co-written with Marie-Laure Bernadac, from the same collection, was one of the bestsellers in France.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.gallimard.fr/Divers/Plus-sur-la-collection/Decouvertes-Gallimard/(sourcenode)/116085 |title=Collection Découvertes Gallimard |publisher=[[Éditions Gallimard]] |accessdate=2018-01-28 |language=fr}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At an interview with ''[[Le Monde de l’éducation]]'', Paule shared her thoughts on youth literature: “Writing for teenagers involves two constraints that on the one hand, a simple expression, a clear writing style, direct without being simplistic; on the other hand, the expression of big questions, profound and existential ones that accompany adolescence and guide us as a lantern in the night –even if we are not aware of it later– in our whole life.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.gallimard-jeunesse.fr/Livres-pour-enfants-Gallimard-Jeunesse/Auteur/Paule-Du-Bouchet |title=Paule Du Bouchet |author=&lt;!--Not stated--&gt; |date= |website=[[Gallimard Jeunesse]] |publisher= |accessdate=2018-01-27 |language=fr |quote=En savoir plus}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Mount Ararat and the Araratian plain (cropped).jpg|thumb|upright=1.8|[[Mount Ararat]] in the [[Caucasus]], with the [[Ararat plain]] in foreground.]]
In [[geography]], a '''plain''' is a flat, sweeping landmass that generally does not change much in [[elevation]]. Plains occur as [[lowland]]s along the bottoms of [[valley]]s or on the doorsteps of [[mountains]], as [[coastal plain]]s, and as [[plateau]]s or [[Highland|uplands]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Rood|first=Stewart B.|last2=Pan|first2=Jason|last3=Gill|first3=Karen M.|last4=Franks|first4=Carmen G.|last5=Samuelson|first5=Glenda M.|last6=Shepherd|first6=Anita|date=2008-02-01|title=Declining summer flows of Rocky Mountain rivers: Changing seasonal hydrology and probable impacts on floodplain forests|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0022169407006920|journal=Journal of Hydrology|volume=349|issue=3–4|pages=397–410|doi=10.1016/j.jhydrol.2007.11.012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a valley, a plain is enclosed on two sides, but in other cases a plain may be delineated by a complete or partial ring of hills, by mountains, or by [[cliff]]s. Where a geological region contains more than one plain, they may be connected by a [[Mountain pass|pass]] (sometimes termed a [[Gap (landform)|gap]]). Coastal plains would mostly rise from [[sea level]] until they run into elevated features such as mountains or plateaus.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Whittow, John |date=1984|title=Dictionary of Physical Geography|location=London|publisher= Penguin|page= 467|isbn=0-14-051094-X}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Plains are one of the major [[landform]]s on earth, where they are present on all continents, and would cover more than one-third of the world’s land area.&lt;ref name=Wilson&gt;{{Cite book

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Plains may have been formed from flowing [[lava]], deposited by water, ice, wind, or formed by [[erosion]] by these agents from hills and mountains. Plains would generally be under the [[grassland]] ([[temperate]] or [[subtropical]]), [[steppe]] ([[semi-arid]]), [[savannah]] ([[tropical climate|tropical]]) or [[tundra]] ([[polar climate|polar]]) biomes. In a few instances, [[desert]]s and [[rainforest]]s can also be plains.&lt;ref&gt;Gornitz, Vivien (ed.). 2009. ''Encyclopedia of Paleoclimatology And Ancient Environments''. Springer: Dordrecht, p. 665.&lt;/ref&gt; 

Plains in many areas are important for [[agriculture]] because where the soils were deposited as [[sediment]]s they may be deep and [[Fertility (soil)|fertile]], and the flatness facilitates mechanization of crop production; or because they support grasslands which provide good grazing for [[livestock]].&lt;ref&gt;Powell, W.

===Depositional plains===
'''Depositional plains''' formed by the deposition of materials brought by various agents of transportation such as glaciers, rivers, waves, and wind. Their fertility and economic relevance depend greatly on the types of sediments that are laid down.&lt;ref name=Jones&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|last=Jones|first=David K.C.|editor-last=Goudie|editor-first=A.S.|editor-link=Andrew Goudie (geographer)|encyclopedia=Encyclopedia of Geomorphology|title=Denudation chronology|year=2004|pages=244–248}}&lt;/ref&gt; The types of depositional plains include:

*{{anchor|Planitia}}[[Planitia]], the [[Latin language|Latin]] word for plain, is used in the naming of plains on extraterrestrial objects (planets and moons), such as [[Hellas Planitia]] on [[Mars]] or [[Sedna Planitia]] on [[Venus]].

*'''Alluvial plains''', which are formed by rivers and which may be one of these overlapping types:
**[[Alluvial plain]]s, formed over a long period of time by a [[river]] depositing sediment on their flood plains or beds, which become [[alluvial]] soil. The difference between a flood plain and an alluvial plain is: a flood plain represents areas experiencing flooding fairly regularly in the present or recently, whereas an alluvial plain includes areas where a flood plain is now and used to be, or areas which only experience flooding a few times a century.&lt;ref name="LandformGloss"&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.nrcs.usda.gov/wps/PA_NRCSConsumption/download?cid=nrcs142p2_053182&amp;ext=pdf | title=Glossary of Landform and Geologic Terms | publisher=[[National Cooperative Soil Survey]] | work=National Soil Survey Handbook—Part 629 | date=April 2013 | format=PDF | accessdate=17 August 2016 | deadurl=no | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161022224040/http://www.nrcs.usda.gov/wps/PA_NRCSConsumption/download/?cid=nrcs142p2_053182&amp;ext=pdf | archivedate=22 October 2016 | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;
**[[Flood plain]], adjacent to a lake, river, stream, or wetland that experiences occasional or periodic [[flooding]].
**[[Scroll plain]], a plain through which a river [[meander]]s with a very low gradient.&lt;!--NOTE this may be merged with flood plain or alluvial plain in the near future.--&gt;

*'''Glacial plains''', formed by the movement of glaciers under the force of gravity:
**[[Outwash plain]] (also known as sandur; plural sandar), a glacial out-wash plain formed of sediments deposited by melt-water at the terminus of a glacier. Sandar consist mainly of stratified (layered and sorted) gravel and sand.&lt;ref&gt;Magilligan F.J., Gomez B., Mertes L.A.K., Smith, L.C.

===Erosional plains===
'''Erosional plains''' have been leveled by various agents of denudation such as running water, rivers, wind and glacier which wear out the rugged surface and smoothens them. Plain resulting from the action of these agents of denudation are called ''[[peneplain]]s'' (almost plain) while plains formed from wind action are called ''[[pediplain]]s''.&lt;ref name=Migon&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|last=Migoń|first=Piotr|author-link=Piotr Migoń|editor-last=Goudie|editor-first=A.S.|editor-link=|encyclopedia=Encyclopedia of Geomorphology|title=Planation surface|year=2004|pages=788–792}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Structural plains===
'''Structural plains''' are relatively undisturbed horizontal surfaces of the Earth. They are structurally depressed areas of the world that make up some of the most extensive natural lowlands on the Earth's surface.&lt;ref name=Brit&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|last=|first=|editor-last=|editor-first=|editor-link=|encyclopedia=Encyclopedia Britannica|title=Pediplain|year=|pages=|url=http://global.britannica.com/science/pediplain}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Pramila Dandavate''' ([[Devanagari]]: ) (1928–2001) was a political activist from Mumbai, associated with the [[Praja Socialist Party]] and later with the [[Janata Party]].

==Early life and background==
Pramila Dandavate (née Karande) was born on 27 August 1928 born to Dr. Janardan and Lakshmibai (née Shanta) Karande. Her father Dr. Janardhan was a famed gynaecologist whose clinic and [[maternity hospital]] were located near the [[Girgaum Chowpatty]]. Dr. Janardan Karande alo served as the President of the Mumbai Obstetrics &amp; Gynecological Society from 1950 to 1952.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.mogsonline.org/past_prezs.html&lt;/ref&gt; Pramila was associated with the ''Swastik League'' during her childhood.&lt;ref name="surana2010"&gt;{{cite book |last=Surana |first= Pannalal |year=2010 |title=Buland Avaaj Baicha (बुलंद आवाज बाईचा) |publisher=Sadhana Prakashan, Pune}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ''Swastik League'' was an organisation established by [[M. R. Jayakar]].&lt;ref name="dayal2007"&gt;{{cite book |last=Dayal |first= John |year=2007 |title=A Matter of Equity: Freedom Of Faith In Secular India |publisher=Anamika Publishers &amp; Distributors (P) Ltd.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Pramila started her schooling at age 5 and painting was her hobby. The [[Second World War]] had started and since [[Bombay]] was a part of the British Empire, there were rumours that [[Bombay]] could possible be attacked by the [[Axis powers]]. As a result, many [[middle class]] families from [[Bombay]] started sending their families to their ancestral homes in [[Konkan]]. Pramila along with her siblings was sent to [[Malvan]] and she completed her fourth standard (which was equal to today's eight standard) from the [[Anant Shivaji Desai]] Topiwala High School. At that time, Rashtra Seva Dal activists like Dnyaneshwar Deulkar used to hold the ''shakha'' and Pramila started attending it.&lt;ref name="surana2010"/&gt;

The downfall of the [[Axis Powers]] including [[Germany]] and [[Japan]] led to a sense of security among the residents of [[Bombay]], and Pramila returned to the city with her siblings. Pramila was then enrolled in the [[Chikitsak Samuha Shirolkar High School]] and she pursued her [[matriculation|Matriculation in India]] from the High School. She started attending a Rashtra Seva Dal ''shakha'' at [[Girgaum]] since 1945. After her [[matriculation|Matriculation in India]], Pramila was enrolled in a [[home science|Home economics]] course at the [[Sophia College for Women]]. But Pramila did not complete the course and after a year at home joined the [[Sir Jamsetjee Jeejebhoy School of Art]]&lt;ref&gt;http://www.streeshakti.com/bookP.aspx?author=14&lt;/ref&gt; from which she earned a graduate degree in Fine Arts in the year 1951.&lt;ref name="surana2010"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://164.100.47.132/LssNew/biodata_1_12/2714.htm&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://indiatoday.intoday.in/story/janata-party-ministers-wives-power-behind-the-throne/1/434950.html&lt;/ref&gt;

After [[Vinoba Bhave]] started the [[Bhoodan movement]], Pramila painted some posters about the movement with the help of her associates. These posters were published in [[Sadhana (weekly)]]. In view of her dedication and love for art, she was appointed as a teacher at an Art School where she worked for some time. Although Pramila enjoyed art, she was always attracted towards the Rashtra Seva Dal activities. She also liked dancing and had taken lessons from the accomplished dancer ''Madame Menaka'' Leila Sokhey.&lt;ref name="surana2010"/&gt;

She was married to [[Madhu Dandavate]] and has a son.

She was elected as member to Mumbai Municipal Corporation during 1968-1973. She had represented [[Mumbai North Central (Lok Sabha constituency)]] in 7th Lok Sabha in 1980-84 as [[Janata Party]] candidate.&lt;ref&gt;{{ cite web |url= http://164.100.47.132/LssNew/biodata_1_12/2714.htm |title= Member's Profile |accessdate = 22 February 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

She died in New Delhi on 31 December 2001, aged 73.&lt;ref&gt;{{ cite web |url=http://hindu.com/2002/01/02/stories/2002010201421100.htm |publisher=The Hindu |title=Pramilla Dandavate is dead |accessdate=22 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.rediff.com/news/2005/nov/12madhu.htm | title=Ex-finance minister Madhu Dandavate dead | publisher=[[Rediff]] | date=12 November 2005 | accessdate=8 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{refimprove|date=July 2011}}
In [[language learning]], the '''principal parts''' of a [[verb]] are those forms that a student must memorize in order to be able to [[grammatical conjugation|conjugate]] the verb through all its forms. The concept originates in the humanist [[Latin]] schools, where students learned verbs by chanting them in the four key forms from which all other forms can be deduced, for example:
:''fero - ferre - tuli - latum''  ('to carry')

Not all languages can be taught in this way. In [[French language|French]], for example, regular verbs can be deduced from a single form, the [[infinitive]], and irregular verbs are too random to be systematized under fixed parts. But the concept can be carried over to many languages in which the verbs have some kind of "regular irregularity", i.e. irregularity always occurs at the same place in an otherwise regular system. 

Although the term 'principal part' is usually applied to verbs, the same phenomenon can be found in some languages in nouns and other word types. It is normally restricted to regular verbs, nouns, etc., and applies to languages where the regular [[Inflectional_paradigm|paradigm]] is based on more than one underlying form. It does not cover random irregularities.

== Classical languages ==
=== Latin ===
{{See also|Latin conjugation#Conjugations}}
In [[Latin language|Latin]], most verbs have four principal parts. For example, the verb for "to carry" is given as ''portō – portāre – portāvī – portātum'', where ''portō'' is the first-person singular present active indicative ("I carry"), ''portāre'' is the present active infinitive ("to carry"), ''portāvī'' is the first-person singular perfect active indicative ("I carried"), and ''portātum'' is the neuter [[supine]]. Most of the verb forms in Latin derive from the first two principal parts: ''portābō'', "I shall carry", is derived from the root ''portā-'', taken from the present infinitive. However, all active perfect forms are derived from the third principal part (so ''portāveram'', "I had carried", is taken from ''portāv-'') while the perfect participle (''portātus, portāta, portātum'', "having been carried") is derived from the supine and is used to form perfect passive participle with the [[auxiliary verb]] ''sum'' (such as ''portātum est'', "it has been carried"). The auxiliary verb is often dropped when writing [[Latin poetry|poetry in Latin]].

For many Latin verbs, the principal parts are predictable: ''portō'' shown above uses a single stem, ''port-'', and all principal parts are derived from them with the endings ''-ō – -āre – -āvī – -ātum''. Others have more complicated forms: ''regō'' ("I rule") has the perfect form ''rēxī'' and perfect participle ''rēctum'', derived as *''reg-sī'' and *''reg-tum''. A handful of verbs, such as ''sum - esse - fuī - futūrum'' ("to be") are simply irregular.

A number of verbs have fewer than four principal parts: [[deponent verb]]s, such as ''hortŏr – hortāri – hortātus sum'', "to exhort", lack a perfect form, as do semi-deponent verbs, such as ''audeō – audēre – ausus sum'', "to dare"; in both cases, passive forms are treated as active, so all perfect forms are covered by the perfect participle. A handful of verbs are also defective, including the verb ''ōdī – ōdisse'', "to hate", which only has perfect forms derived from a single stem.

=== Ancient Greek ===
{{See also|Ancient Greek verbs}}
Verbs in [[Ancient Greek]] have six principal parts: present (I), future (II), [[Aorist (Ancient Greek)|aorist]] (III), perfect (IV), perfect middle (V) and aorist passive (VI), each listed in its first-person singular form:

*Part I forms the entire present system, as well as the imperfect.
*Part II forms the future tense in the active and middle voices.
*Part III forms the aorist in the active and middle voices.
*Part IV forms the perfect and pluperfect in the active voice, and the (exceedingly rare) future perfect, active.
*Part V forms the perfect and pluperfect in the middle voice, and the (rare) future perfect, middle.
*Part VI forms the aorist and future in the passive voice.

One principal part can sometimes be predicted from another, but not with any certainty. For some classes of verbs, however, all principal parts can be predicted given the first one.

==Germanic languages==
=== English ===
The principal parts of an [[English verb]] are the [[infinitive]], [[preterite]] and [[past participle]].  Lists or recitations of principal parts in English often omit the third principal part's auxiliary verb, rendering it identical to its grammatically distinct [[participial]] form. For example, the verb "to take" has the principal parts ''take–took–(have) taken''. The verb "to bet" has ''bet–bet–(have) bet'' and the verb "to break" has ''break–broke–(have) broken''. With irregular verbs the simple present 3S (he, she, it) is derived from infinitive+'s' with the exception of: catch-catches, fly-flies and teach-teaches.

====Examples of irregular verbs and their principal parts==== 

{{Col-begin}}
{{col-break}} 
{| class="wikitable"
|+ preterite is irregular
! Part !! rendering
|-
| infinitive || to '''come'''
|-

|-
| past participle|| '''{{font color|red|sung}}'''
|-
|}
{{Col-end}}

====Regular verbs====

Most verbs are regular enough not to require a knowledge of the principal parts as the preterite and past participle can be easily derived from the infinitive. For example, the verb ''love'' derives all its forms systematically (''love, loved, loving''), and since these can all be deduced from the basic form (the citation, dictionary, or lexicographic form, which in English is the bare [[infinitive]]), no other principal parts have to be learned. With [[irregular verbs]] like the verb ''sing'', on the other hand, the forms ''sang'' and ''(have) sung'' cannot be deduced, so the learner of English must memorize three principal parts, ''sing–sang–(have) sung''. The present 3S (he/she/it) is derived from the infinitive+'s' with the exception of verbs ending in a single -o, or ending in -s, -x, -z or the digraphs -sh, -ch, in which case it is derived from 'infinitive+es'

{{Col-end}}

====Highly irregular verbs====

There are a handful of verbs in [[English language|English]] that are so irregular that the three principal parts are not enough to [[grammatical conjugation|conjugate]] them fully requiring four principal parts  and to be requires seven principal parts. The present 3S has its own part while the present 1&amp;3S and 123P are derived from the infinitive like regular verbs are. The pronunciation of the 3S cannot be derived from the infinitive.

|-
| past participle || '''{{font color|red|gone}}'''
|-
|}

{{Col-end}}

====To be====
For example, the verb "to be" has the principal parts ''be–was/were–(have) been'', showing an irregular past tense (''was'' for the first- and third-person singular, and ''were'' for the rest), and an entirely irregular present tense (using ''am'', ''is'' and ''are'' instead of forms derived from the first principal part ''be'').

{| class="wikitable"
|+ To be with seven principal parts

|-
| preterite 1S || '''{{font color|red|was}}'''
|-
| preterite 2S || '''{{font color|red|were}}'''
|-
| past participle || '''{{font color|red|been}}'''
|-
|}
*present 123P are the same as present 2S (are)
*preterite 3S is the same as preterite 1S (was)
*preterite 123P are the same as preterite 2S (were)

====Deriving the various tenses from the principal parts====

Regular and irregular verbs are easily formed from the three of the principal parts (except for highly irregular which have irregular forms in the simple present and simple past). Here is a sample of the many different forms of tenses with examples. 
{| class="wikitable"
|+ To be with seven principal parts
! Tense !! formula !! example infinitive !! rendering !! example
|-
| simple present || PRESENT(+s/es) || to love || I love, he loves || I like history.
|-
| simple past || PRETERITE || to sing || I sang, he sang || They sang until midnight.
|-
| continuous  || (auxiliary) PRESENT of to be + GERUND || to grow || I am growing, he is growing&lt;br/&gt;I was growing, you were growing&lt;br/&gt;we will be growing, they may be growing|| I'm going to the centre tomorrow.
|-
| perfect tenses || (auxiliary) relevant form of to have + PAST-PARTICIPLE || slept || I have slept, he has slept&lt;br/&gt;they will have slept, we should have slept || I have worked all day.
|-
| conditional tenses || would/should/could + PRESENT || to hear || I would hear, they should hear|| I should meet her tomorow.
|-
| simple future || will/shall + PRESENT || to try || I will try, he shall try || They will arrive at noon.
|-
| going to (as future) || relevant form of to be + going + INFINITIVE || to dance || I am going to dance, I will be going to eat (colloquial) ||Who is going to watch the game?
|-
| present subjunctive || (that/if/etc.) PRESENT || to be || that you be, if he be || It's important that he be prepared this time!
|-
| past subjunctive || (that/if/etc.) PRETERITE (was is permitted with to be) || to be || that I were, if I was || If only I were younger...
|-
| imperative || (let's) PRESENT! (without subject) || to go  || Go!&lt;br/&gt;Let's go! || Go now!
|-
|}
1. PRESENT is formed from the infinitive (without 'to') i.e. to break-break
2. GERUND is formed from PRESENT+ing i.e. to stop-stopping (a few minor spelling changes))

=== German ===
The situation in German is very similar to English. Regular verbs require no memorizing of principal parts, since all forms can be deduced from the infinitive. However, some uncertainty may exist as to the choice of the perfect [[auxiliary verb|auxiliary]], which could be ''haben'' ('to have') or ''sein'' ('to be'). This can be solved by memorizing the infinitive with the third-person singular perfect tense, which some teachers recommend.
:''tanzen - er hat getanzt''

[[Germanic strong verb|Strong verbs]] and irregular [[Germanic weak verb|weak verbs]] are more complicated. As in English, these verbs are usually memorized by means of three principal parts: ''infinitive – third-person singular past tense – third-person singular perfect tense''. 
:''singen - sang - gesungen''  ('to sing' - a typical strong verb)
:''bringen - brachte - gebracht'' ('to bring' - an irregular weak verb)

However, in order to deduce the full paradigm, learners must also know the ''third-person singular present'' and the ''third-person singular past subjunctive'', which involve some peculiarities. 

A small number of verbs have other irregularities, most of which are limited to the forms of the present tense.

=== Icelandic ===
There are four types of principal parts in the [[Icelandic language]], determined by the type of verb:

==== Weak verbs ====
Icelandic [[Germanic weak verb|weak verbs]] have the following principal parts:
{| class="wikitable"
!First principal part 
!Second principal part
!Third principal part
|-
![[Infinitive]]
![[Grammatical person|First person]] [[Grammatical number|singular]] [[past tense]] [[Realis mood|indicative mood]]
![[Participle|Past participle]]
|-
|að ''borða'' ("to ''eat''") ||ég ''borðaði'' ("I ''ate''")||ég hef ''borðað'' ("I have ''eaten'')
|-
|Að ''elska'' ("to ''love''")||ég ''elskaði'' ("I ''loved''") ||ég hef ''elskað'' ("I have ''loved''")
|}

It is possible to make the [[present tense|present]] [[subjunctive mood]] (þótt ég ''borði'', "though I ''eat''") from the first principal part (að ''borða'', "to ''eat''"). It is also possible to make the [[past tense|past]] [[subjunctive mood]] (þótt ég ''borðaði'', "though I ''ate''") from the second principal part (ég ''borðaði'', "I ''ate''").

In some other classes of weak verbs without 'a' as the thematic vowel, the present indicative singular undergoes more changes, but they are still to a large extent predictable.

==== Strong verbs ====
Icelandic [[Germanic strong verb|strong verbs]] have the following principal parts:
{| class="wikitable"
!First principal part
!Second principal part
!Third principal part
!Fourth principal part
|-
![[Infinitive]]
![[Grammatical person|First person]] [[Grammatical number|singular]] [[past tense]] [[Realis mood|indicative mood]]
![[Grammatical person|First person]] [[Grammatical number|plural]] [[past tense]] [[Realis mood|indicative mood]]
![[participle|Past participle]]
|-
|Að ''finna'' ("to ''find''")||Ég ''fann'' ("I ''found''")||Við ''fundum'' ("we ''found''")||Ég hef ''fundið'' ("I have ''found''")
|}

It is possible to make the [[present tense|present]] [[subjunctive mood]] (þótt ég ''finni'', "though I ''find''") from the first principal part (að ''finna'', "to ''find''"). It is also possible to make the [[past tense|past]] [[subjunctive mood]] (þótt ég ''fyndi'', "though I ''found''") from the third principal part (við ''fundum'', "we ''found''").

The present singular indicative in this class also undergoes more changes(i-umlaut, dental suffix assimilation etc.), which may let some verbs seem irregular at first glance. They are, however, mainly regular changes, like those in the weak verbs.

==== Preterite-present verb ====
Icelandic [[Preterite-present verb]]s have the following principal parts:

{| class="wikitable"
!First principal part
!Second principal part
!Third principal part
!Fourth principal part
|-
![[Infinitive]]
![[Grammatical person|First person]] [[Grammatical number|singular]] [[present tense]] [[Realis mood|indicative mood]]
![[Grammatical person|First person]] [[Grammatical number|singular]] [[past tense]] [[Realis mood|indicative mood]]
![[participle|Past participle]]
|-
|Að ''kunna'' ("to ''know''")||Ég ''kann'' ("I ''know''")||Ég ''kunni'' ("I ''knew''")||Ég hef ''kunnað'' ("I've ''known''")
|}

It is possible to make the [[present tense|present]] [[subjunctive mood]] (þótt ég ''kunni'', "though I ''knew''") from the first principal part (að ''kunna'', "to ''know''"). It is also possible to make the [[past tense|past]] [[subjunctive mood]] (þótt ég ''kynni'', "though I ''knew''") from the third principal part (ég ''kunni'', "I ''knew''").

==== Ri-verbs ====
Icelandic [[Ri-verb]]s have the following principal parts:

{| class="wikitable"
!First principal part
!Second principal part
!Third principal part
|-
![[Infinitive]]
![[Grammatical person|First person]] [[Grammatical number|singular]] [[past tense]] [[Realis mood|indicative mood]]
![[participle|Past participle]]
|-
|Að ''snúa'' ("to ''turn''")||Ég ''sneri''&lt;ref name="e"&gt;[[Ri-verb]]s are written with an ''e'' in the second principal part according to the [[Ministry of Education (Iceland)|Icelandic Ministry of Education]] even though it is pronounced as if it were written with an ''é''.&lt;/ref&gt; ("I ''turned''")||Ég hef ''snúið'' ("I have ''turned''")
|-
|Að ''gróa'' ("to ''heal''")||Ég ''greri'''&lt;ref name="e" /&gt; ("I ''healed''")||Ég hef ''gróið'' ("I have ''healed''")
|-
|Að ''núa'' ("to ''rub''")||Ég ''neri'''&lt;ref name="e" /&gt; ("I ''rubbed''")||Ég hef ''núið'' ("I have ''rubbed''")
|-
|Að ''róa'' ("to ''row''")||Ég ''reri'''&lt;ref name="e" /&gt; ("I ''rowed''")||Ég hef ''róið'' ("I have ''rowed''")
|}

It is possible to make the [[present tense|present]] [[subjunctive mood]] (þótt ég ''snúi'', "though I ''turn''") from the first principal part (að ''snúa'', "to ''turn''"). It is also possible to make the [[past tense|past]] [[subjunctive mood]] (þótt ég ''sneri'', "though I ''turned''") from the second principal part (ég ''sneri'', "I ''turned''").

== Others ==
=== Spanish ===
In [[Spanish language|Spanish]], verbs are traditionally held to have only one principal part, the infinitive, by which one can classify the verb into one of three conjugation paradigms (according to the ending of the infinitive, which may be ''-ar'', ''-er'' or ''-ir''). However, some scholars believe that the conjugation could be regularized by adding another principal part to [[Spanish irregular verbs#Vowel-alternating verbs|vowel-alternating verbs]], which shows the alternation. For example, ''herir'' "to hurt" is usually considered irregular because its conjugation contains forms like ''hiero'' "I hurt", ''hieres'' "you hurt", where the vowel in the [[root (linguistics)|root]] changes into a diphthong. However, by including the first person singular, present tense, indicative mood form (''hiero'') as a principal part, and noting that the [[diphthong]] appears only when that syllable is stressed, the conjugation of ''herir'' becomes completely predictable. ''(See also [[Spanish verbs]], [[Spanish conjugation]].)''

===French===

Regular verbs are formed from a single principal part (the infinitive), and all conjugations  derive from this one principal part. A handful of verbs require spelling changes in which case it can be considered that these verbs technically have two or three principal parts depending on how many spelling changes need to me made. They include doubling a consonant, adding accent markers, adding the letter e and converting letters such a y becomes i.

====Seven principal parts====

Irregular verbs are markedly more complicating require seven principal parts of which few can be easily derived from the infinitive. For some verbs a few of their principal parts are identical with one another.

====Verbs with 11 principal parts====

A few highly irregular verbs require 11 principal parts to conjugate them fully. It includes all of the seven principal parts as well as a subjunctive form and different present participle forms, imperative forms and present-participle forms.

====Fully irregular verbs====

The verbs être, avoir and aller are so irregular they require even more than 11 principal parts.

=== Scottish Gaelic ===
In [[Scottish Gaelic]] there are two principal parts for the regular verb: the [[imperative mood|imperative]] and the [[verbal noun]], for example {{lang|gd|pòg}} – {{lang|gd|pògadh}} 'to kiss'. All finite forms can be deduced from the imperative {{lang|gd|pòg}} ('kiss!'), all non-finite forms from the verbal noun {{lang|gd|pògadh}} ('kissing'). The ten irregular verbs can, with only two or three small aberrations (unexpected lenition), be deduced from four principal parts.

=== Ganda ===
The principal parts of a [[Luganda|Ganda]] verb are the [[imperative mood|imperative]] (identical to the [[verb stem]]), the [[Grammatical person|first person singular]] of the [[present tense]] and the modified stem. For example, the verb ''okwogera'' 'to speak' has the principal parts ''yogera–njogera–yogedde''.

The [[present tense]], far past tense, near future tense, far future tense, [[subjunctive]] and [[infinitive]] are derived from the imperative. The [[present perfect]], [[conditional tense|conditional]] and near past tense are derived from the modified stem.

In theory the second principal part can be derived from the first, but in practice this is so complicated that it is usually memorised as a separate principal part.

The '''Ritual Decalogue'''&lt;ref&gt;Occasionally also called the '''Cultic Decalogue''', the '''Ceremonial Decalogue''', the '''Ritual Ten Commandments''', the '''Cultic Ten Commandments''', the '''J-Decalogue''' or '''Yahwist Decalogue''', the '''Exodus-34 Decalogue''' or '''Decalogue of Exodus xxxiv''', or the '''Small Covenant Code'''.&lt;/ref&gt; is a list of laws at {{bibleverse-lb||Exodus|34:11–26|HE}}. These laws are similar to the [[Covenant Code]] and are followed by the phrase "[[ten commandments]]" ({{lang-he|עשרת הדברים}} ''{{lang|he-Latn|aseret ha-dvarîm}}'', in {{bibleverse-lb||Exodus|34:28|HE}}). Although the phrase "Ten Commandments" has traditionally been interpreted as referring to a very different set of laws, in {{bibleverse-lb||Exodus|20:2–17|HE}},&lt;ref name=RefExodus20&gt;
*'Exodus 34:28 says, "And [Moses] wrote upon the tablets the words of the covenant, ten of the words" ... the text is not precise about what is written. The final phrase, "ten of the words," is awkward. Traditionally, it is taken as a reference back to the Ten Commandments in Exodus 20. (McEntire 2008:9)
*"[Exodus] 34:1–28 The Proclamation of the Covenant: [...] the covenant stipulations are not the same as those in chaps. 20–23. This is surprising, because it is the clear implication of v. 1 that the new tablets are to have the same thing on them that the broken tablets had, and v. 28 states flatly that Moses writes 'the ten utterances' on the tablets." (Mays 1988:143)&lt;/ref&gt; many scholars believe it instead refers to the Ritual Decalogue found two verses earlier.&lt;ref&gt;
*"The Ten Commandments occur in three versions. Two are almost identical with each other [...], but the third, which apparently replaced the tablets that were broken, is quite different" (Alexander &amp; Baker 2003:501)
*"What is the purpose of the Decalogue, commonly called the Ten Commandments, and why does the Pentateuch contain three versions (Exodus 20, Deuteronomy 5, and Exodus 34)?" (Aaron 2006:1)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Cross&gt;
"There is another and, acc. to many OT critics, older version of the 'Ten Words' preserved in Exod. 34:11–28, where much more emphasis is laid on ritual prescriptions." (Cross &amp; Livingstone 1997:382)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Whybray&gt;
"Another series is to be found in Exodus 34:14–26, sometimes referred to as the "Ritual Decalogue" in distinction from the "Ethical Decalogue"; it is called the "ten commandments" in v.28 and was inscribed by Moses at God's dictation on the second set of tablets that replaced the broken ones. The collection in Exodus 34 has some laws in common with the "Ethical Decalogue", but focuses more on cultic matters." (Whybray 1995:116)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Friedman/&gt;

[[Biblical criticism|Critical biblical scholars]] understand the two sets of laws to have different authorship.&lt;ref name=Friedman&gt;
[Exodus] 4:28. the Ten Commandments. The second set of the commandments appears here in vv. 14-26. ] In critical biblical scholarship we understand these two versions of the Decalogue to come from two different ancient sources. (Friedman 2003)&lt;/ref&gt;
Early scholars, adopting a proposal of [[Johann Wolfgang von Goethe]],&lt;ref name=Levinson&gt;Levinson (July 2002)&lt;/ref&gt; contrasted the "Ritual" Decalogue with the "Ethical" Decalogue of {{bibleverse-lb||Exodus|20:2–17|HE}} and {{bibleverse-lb||Deuteronomy|5:6–21|HE}},&lt;ref&gt;Other names include the Moral Decalogue, the Ethical or Moral Ten Commandments, and the E-Decalogue or Elohist Decalogue.&lt;/ref&gt; which are the texts more generally known as the Ten Commandments.&lt;ref&gt;Goethe appears to have been the first to consider these two dissimilar sets of Ten Commandments as a theological problem, but was not the first to notice them. Earlier observers include Houbigant (''Biblia Hebraica'', 1753) and the anonymous Greek author of the late-5th-century ''Tübingen Theosophy'', who held that "two decalogues were written by Moses" in Exodus 20 and 34. (Albert Knudson, 1909. "The So-called J Decalogue", ''Journal of Biblical literature'', vol. 28, p. 83; William Badè, 1915. ''The Old Testament in the light of to-day'', p 89.)&lt;/ref&gt;  Believing that the Bible reflected a shift over time from an emphasis on the ritual to the ethical, they argued that the Ritual Decalogue was composed earlier than the Ethical Decalogue.&lt;ref name=Cross/&gt;&lt;ref name=Whybray/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Richard N. Soulen, R. Kendall Soulen. ''Handbook of Biblical Criticism'', Westminster John Knox Press, 2001, p. 44. "Decalogue (Gk: lit., "Ten Words") is the Greek (LXX) name for the "Ten Commandments"... the term appears in Exod 34:28; Deut 4:13; 10:4; the commandments themselves in Exod 20 and Deut 5."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Levinson, Bernard M. (July 2002). "Goethe's Analysis of Exodus 34 and Its Influence on Julius Wellhausen: The Pfropfung of the Documentary Hypothesis". Zeitschrift für die Alttestamentliche Wissenschaft 114 (2): 212–223&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;
"There are two lists of pithy prohibitions in Exod. 20:1–17 (paralleled in Deut. 5:6–21) and in Exod. 34:11–26 that occupy pivotal points in the theophany and covenant texts. The lists of Exodus 34 and Deuteronomy 5 are called "ten commandments" in the biblical text (cf. Exod 34:27 and Deut. 4:13; 10:4), and that title, or the equivalent Latin term Decalogue, has traditionally been applied to the list of Exodus 20/Deuteronomy 5. Biblical scholars often distinguish the Exodus 20/Deuteronomy 5 list from the Exodus 34 list on the basis of content by referring to the former as the Ethical Decalogue and the latter as the Ritual Decalogue." (''The Hebrew Bible: A Brief Socio-Literary Introduction.'' Norman Gottwald, 2008:118)&lt;/ref&gt;
Later scholars have held that they were actually parallel developments, with the Ethical Decalogue a late addition to Exodus copied from Deuteronomy, or that the Ritual Decalogue was the later of the two, a conservative reaction to the secular Ethical Decalogue.&lt;ref name=Aaron&gt;Aaron (2006)&lt;/ref&gt;
A few Bible scholars call the verses in Exodus 34 the "small Covenant code", as it appears to be a compact version of the Covenant Code in Exodus {{bibleverse-nb||Exodus|20:19|HE}}–{{bibleverse-nb||Exodus|23:33|HE}}; they argue the small Covenant code was composed around the same time as the Decalogue of Exodus 20, but either served different functions within Israelite religion, or reflects the influence of other Ancient Near Eastern religious texts.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;Julius Morgenstern 1927 ''The Oldest Document of the Hexateuch'' HUAC volume IV&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="YehezkelKaufmann"/&gt;&lt;ref name="JohnBright"/&gt;

The word ''decalogue'' comes from the Greek name for the Ten Commandments, {{lang|el|δέκα λόγοι}} (''{{lang|el-Latn|déka lógoi}}''; "ten terms"), a translation of the Hebrew {{lang|he|עשרת הדברים}} (''{{lang|he-Latn|aseret ha-dvarîm}}'' "the ten items/terms").

==Biblical context==
The Ritual Decalogue is framed in the context of God making a [[Mosaic covenant|covenant]] with Israel:&lt;ref&gt;Since God's speech commences in v. 10 with reference to—indeed a performative of—a covenant, and the speech concludes ... with an instruction to write down these very words, on the basis of which the covenant is made, it might seem reasonable to regard the whole of vv. 10-26 as incorporated in this covenant. That, no doubt, is the sense intended by the redactors. (Jackson 2000:254)&lt;/ref&gt;

:''Yahweh said to [[Moses]], Cut two tablets of stone like the former ones, and I will write on the tablets the words that were on the former tablets, which you broke. ''...'' I hereby make a covenant''.
:: [Commandments of Exodus 34]
: ''Yahweh said to Moses, Write these words; in accordance with these words I have made a covenant with you and with Israel. ''...'' And he wrote on the tablets the words of the covenant, '''the ten commandments''''' [{{lang|he|עשרת הדברים}} ''{{lang|he-Latn|aseret ha-dvarîm}}''].

This is the only place in the Bible where the phrase ''Ten Commandments'' identifies a set of commandments.

==Interpretations==

While Orthodox Judaism and Christianity hold that both sets contained the same ten commandments, some scholars identify verses 11-26 as an alternate "ten commandments" which they call the "ritual" decalogue.&lt;ref name="Whybray"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"The Ten Commandments occur in three versions. Two are almost identical with each other [...], but the third, which apparently replaced the tablets that were broken, is quite different" (Alexander &amp; Baker 2003:501)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"What is the purpose of the Decalogue, commonly called the Ten Commandments, and why does the Pentateuch contain three versions (Exodus 20, Deuteronomy 5, and Exodus 34)?" (Aaron 2006:1)&lt;/ref&gt; For these scholars, the terms "ritual decalogue" and "ethical decalogue" are a way of distinguishing between alternate inscriptions of the ten commandments.

The commandments in the Ritual Decalogue are expanded upon in the [[Covenant Code]], which occurs prior to it in the Torah, and thus have the impression of being a summary of the important points in the Code. The Covenant Code is believed by most scholars of [[biblical criticism]] as having originally been a separate text to the Torah, and thus there is much debate as to the relationship between the Ritual Decalogue and Covenant Code.  There are essentially two positions, neither of which is decisively supported, either by evidence, or by number of scholars:

* Either the commandments of the Ritual Decalogue were originally indistinct commandments in the body of a much larger work, such as the Covenant Code, and were selected as being the most important by some process, whether gradual filtering or by an individual,
* Or the Covenant Code represents a later expansion of the Ritual Decalogue, with additional commandments added on, again either by gradual aggregation, or by an individual.

The [[documentary hypothesis]] identifies the Ritual Decalogue as the work of the [[Jahwist]], from the [[Kingdom of Judah]], and the Covenant Code as that of the [[Elohist]], from the [[Kingdom of Israel (Samaria)|Kingdom of Israel]], both writing independently. It does not however answer the question of how these texts were related, merely that the Ritual Decalogue circulated in Judah, and the Covenant Code in Israel. What the documentary hypothesis does partly explain is the relationship of the Ritual Decalogue to the Ethical Decalogue, and why, instead of the Ethical Decalogue, it is the Ritual Decalogue which is written on the two tablets when Moses ascends the mountain to have the Ethical Decalogue inscribed for a second time.

The documentary hypothesis claims that the Jahwist and Elohist texts were first combined by a redactor, producing a text referred to simply as [[JE]], in such a way that it now reads that God dictated the Covenant Code, which was written onto stone, Moses subsequently smashing these stones at the incident of the golden calf, and thus having to go back and get a new set, with a set of commandments, the Ritual Decalogue, resembling the first. Under this reconstruction another writer, the [[Priestly source]], later took offence at parts of JE, and rewrote it, dropping the story of the golden calf, and replacing the Ritual Decalogue with a new (ethical) decalogue initially based on it, but taking commandments from elsewhere as well, and replacing the Covenant Code with a vast new law code, placed after the Decalogue for narrative reasons, most of which forms the greater part of the [[mitzvah|mitzvot]] in [[Leviticus]].

The reconstruction then suggests that a century later yet another writer, the [[Deuteronomist]], objected to the Priestly source, and rewrote it yet again, but in a different style:  that of a series of flashbacks, producing a second slightly different copy of the Ethical Decalogue, and re-introducing the golden calf. Presented with such divergent versions of the same event, [[Documentary hypothesis#R,Redactor|a later redactor]] is thought to have combined all three versions – JE, the Priestly source, and Deuteronomist, together. JE and the Priestly source were interleaved together, altering JE so that it was now the Ethical Decalogue which was written on the first set of tablets and subsequently destroyed. The alteration, by careful juxtaposition, subtly implied that the second set of tablets also received the Ethical rather than Ritual Decalogue, despite the text saying, immediately after the Ritual Decalogue,
: ''The {{Lord}} said to Moses, Write '''these''' words; in accordance with '''these''' words I have made '''a covenant''' with you and with Israel. […] And he wrote on the tablets the words of the '''covenant''', the ten commandments'' [emphasis added]

13 You shall not murder.

14 You shall not commit adultery.

15 You shall not steal.

16 You shall not bear false witness against your neighbor.

17 You shall not covet your neighbor’s house; you shall not covet your neighbor’s wife, or male or female slave, or ox, or donkey, or anything that belongs to your neighbor.

7 you shall have no other gods before me.

8 You shall not make for yourself an idol, whether in the form of anything that is in heaven above, or that is on the earth beneath, or that is in the water under the earth.

9 You shall not bow down to them or worship them; for I the Lord your God am a jealous God, punishing children for the iniquity of parents, to the third and fourth generation of those who reject me,

10 but showing steadfast love to the thousandth generation of those who love me and keep my commandments.

11 You shall not make wrongful use of the name of the Lord your God, for the Lord will not acquit anyone who misuses his name.

14 But the seventh day is a Sabbath to the Lord your God; you shall not do any work—you, or your son or your daughter, or your male or female slave, or your ox or your donkey, or any of your livestock, or the resident alien in your towns, so that your male and female slave may rest as well as you.

15 Remember that you were a slave in the land of Egypt, and the Lord your God brought you out from there with a mighty hand and an outstretched arm; therefore the Lord your God commanded you to keep the sabbath day.

==Covenant codes compared==
Some scholars, calling attention to {{bibleverse-lb||Exodus|34:10}}, "Then the {{LORD}} said: 'I am making a covenant with you'," note that the laws of Exodus 34 appear to be a shorter and differently organized version of the [[Covenant Code]] ({{bibleverse-lb||Exodus|20:22–23:33}}).&lt;ref&gt;Aaron (2006:306–307)&lt;/ref&gt; These have been differentiated as the "Small Covenant Code" (Exodus 34) and the "Large Covenant Code" (Exodus 20–23).&lt;ref name="ReferenceA" /&gt;&lt;ref name="YehezkelKaufmann"&gt;Yehezkel Kaufmann 1960 ''The Religion of Israel: from its beginnings to the Babylonian Exile'' translated and abridged by Moshe Greenberg. New York: Shocken Press. 166&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="JohnBright"&gt;John Bright 1972 ''A History of Israel'' Second Edition. Philadelphia: the Westminster Press. 142, 164, 166&lt;/ref&gt; These views are not mutually exclusive. Aaron (2006), for example, discusses how the "Exodus 34 Decalogue", while presented as the Ten Commandments, appears to be a reworking of the Covenant Code. Indeed, [[H.L. Ginsberg]] believed that the Ritual Decalogue was an interpolation, and that the phrase "Ten Commandments" in Exodus 34:28 originally referred to a portion of the Covenant Code, {{bibleverse-lb||Exodus|23:10–27}}, which he called ''the First Ritual Decalogue''.&lt;ref&gt;Ginsberg (1982:46)&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Ronga''' ('''XiRonga'''; sometimes '''ShiRonga''' or '''GiRonga''') is a south-eastern [[Bantu languages|Bantu language]] in the [[Tswa–Ronga]] family spoken just south of [[Maputo]] in [[Mozambique]].  It extends a little into [[South Africa]]. It has about 650,000 speakers in Mozambique and a further 90,000 in South Africa, with dialects including Konde, Putru and Kalanga.

The Swiss philologist Henri Alexandre Junod seems to have been the first linguist to have studied it, in the late 19th century.

==Writing==
Its alphabet is based on that of [[Tsonga language|Tsonga]] as provided by [[Methodism|Methodist]] missionaries and [[Portuguese Empire|Portuguese]] settlers.

==Grammar==

Ronga is grammatically so close to [[Tsonga language | Tsonga]] in many ways that census officials often consider it a dialect; its noun class system is very similar and its verbal forms are almost identical. Its most immediately noticeable difference is a much greater influence from Portuguese, due to being centred near the capital Maputo (formerly Lourenço Marques).

'''Rongowhakaata''' "'''Rongo'''" '''Pere Halbert''' (2 February 1894 – 11 April 1973) was a [[Māori people|Māori]] tribal leader, interpreter, historian and [[genealogist]]. He was considered "an eminent authority on Māori literature".&lt;ref name="dnzb" /&gt; Halbert's book ''Horouta: The History of the Horouta Canoe, Gisborne and East Coast'', published [[List of works published posthumously|posthumously]] in 1999, is considered a classic of tribal history.&lt;ref name="Beattie"/&gt;

==Early life==
Halbert was born on 2 February 1894 in Waerenga-a-Hika, [[Gisborne, New Zealand|Gisborne]], to Hetekia Te Kani Pere (or Halbert), a farmer, and his wife, Riripeti Rangikohera Ranginui. His grandfather was noted Māori politician [[Wi Pere]]. Halbert attended school in Gisborne up until 1911. He then attended [[Nelson College]] from 1911 to 1914, where he was a [[prefect]] and excelled at sports and music.&lt;ref name="dnzb"/&gt;

On 11 September 1915, he married Patehepa Tamatea and together they had seven children. For a time they ran a dairy farm at Pukepapa, near Waituhi.&lt;ref name="dnzb" /&gt;

==Career==

Halbert became a licensed interpreter in 1915.&lt;ref name="pbh-interpeting"/&gt; His strong command of the [[Māori language]] combined with his knowledge of Māori literature gained him important roles such as assisting the [[New Zealand Geographic Board]] with Māori place names, and revising the sixth edition of H. W. Williams's Māori dictionary. Later he acted as an adviser on Māori texts for the [[Polynesian Society]]. Halbert was a founding member of the Gisborne Art Gallery and Museum in 1955, and the first chairman of the Maori Museum Committee, advising on the Māori collections.&lt;ref name="dnzb" /&gt;

As a historian and genealogist, Halbert contributed to John Hikawera Mitchell's ''Takitimu'' (1944), a record of the migration of the [[Ngati Kahungunu]].&lt;ref name="takitimu"/&gt; He also contributed to the Whakatane and District Historical Society's first memoir, ''Te Tini o Toi'', as well as papers on the dating of Maori genealogies.&lt;ref name="dnzb" /&gt;

From 1940 onwards Halbert devoted most of his time to studying the history and genealogy of the East Coast [[iwi]].&lt;ref name="dnzb" /&gt; In 1999 his book ''Horouta: The History of the Horouta Canoe, Gisborne and East Coast'' was posthumously published by [[Reed Publishing]].&lt;ref name="Beattie" /&gt;

Poor health forced Halbert's retirement from the Maori Purposes Fund Board in 1968. He died at Lavington Private Hospital in [[Epsom, New Zealand|Epsom]], Auckland on 11 April 1973 and was buried at Taruheru Cemetery in Gisborne. He was survived by three daughters and three sons.&lt;ref name="dnzb" /&gt;

At the time of his death, Halbert was preparing a major historical and genealogical work. He left three main collections of papers: a manuscript called 'Horouta', 130 complete [[whakapapa]] charts, and a series of maps and historical data with iwi and [[hapū]].&lt;ref name="dnzb" /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9906">'''Rule-based machine translation''' ('''RBMT'''; "Classical Approach" of MT) is [[machine translation]] systems based on '''linguistic information''' about source and target languages basically retrieved from (unilingual, bilingual or multilingual) '''dictionaries''' and '''grammars''' covering the main semantic, morphological, and syntactic regularities of each language respectively.  Having input sentences (in some source language), an RBMT system generates them to output sentences (in some target language) on the basis of morphological, syntactic, and [[Semantic analysis (computational)|semantic analysis]] of both the source and the target languages involved in a concrete translation task.

== History ==

The first RBMT systems were developed in the early 1970s. The most important steps of this evolution were the emergence of the following RBMT systems:

* Systran (http://www.systran.de/) 
* Japanese MT systems (http://aamt.info/english/mtsys.htm, http://www.wtec.org/loyola/ar93_94/mt.htm)
* EUROTRA ([[Eurotra]])

Today, other common RBMT systems include:
* [[Apertium]]
* [[GramTrans]]

== Types of RBMT ==

There are three different types of rule-based machine translation systems:

# '''Direct Systems''' ([[Dictionary-based machine translation|Dictionary Based Machine Translation]]) map input to output with basic rules.
# '''Transfer RBMT Systems''' ([[Transfer-based machine translation|Transfer Based Machine Translation]])  employ morphological and syntactical analysis.
# '''Interlingual RBMT Systems''' ([[Interlingual machine translation|Interlingua]]) use an abstract meaning.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Statistical Machine Translation |last=Koehn |first=Philipp |year=2010 |publisher=Cambridge University Press |location=Cambridge |page=15}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | jstor = 10.2307/40008396 | title = Knowledge-Based Machine Translation | last = Nirenburg | first = Sergei |year = 1989 | work = Machine Trandation 4 (1989), 5 - 24 | publisher = Kluwer Academic Publishers }}&lt;/ref&gt;

RBMT systems can also be characterized as the systems opposite to Example-based Systems of Machine Translation ([[Example-based machine translation|Example Based Machine Translation]]), whereas Hybrid Machine Translations Systems make use of many principles derived from RBMT.

== Basic principles ==

The main approach of RBMT systems is based on linking the structure of the given input sentence with the structure of the demanded output sentence, necessarily preserving their unique meaning. The following example can illustrate the general frame of RBMT:  
 
::''A girl eats an apple.'' Source Language = English; Demanded Target Language = German

Minimally, to get a German translation of this English sentence one needs:

# A dictionary that will map each English word to an appropriate German word.
# Rules representing regular English sentence structure.
# Rules representing regular German sentence structure.

And finally, we need rules according to which one can relate these two structures together.

Accordingly, we can state the following '''stages of translation''':

::'''1st:'''  getting basic part-of-speech information of each source word:

:::a = indef.article; girl = noun; eats = verb; an = indef.article; apple = noun

::'''2nd:''' getting syntactic information about the verb “to eat”:

:::NP-eat-NP; here: eat – Present Simple, 3rd Person Singular, Active Voice

::'''3rd:''' parsing the source sentence:

:::(NP an apple) = the object of eat

Often only partial parsing is sufficient to get to the syntactic structure of the source sentence and to map it onto the structure of the target sentence.

::'''4th:''' translate English words into German

:::a (category = indef.article) =&gt; ein (category = indef.article)

:::girl (category = noun) =&gt; Mädchen (category = noun)

:::eat (category = verb) =&gt; essen (category = verb)

:::an (category = indef. article) =&gt; ein (category = indef.article)

:::apple (category = noun) =&gt; Apfel (category = noun)

::'''5th:''' Mapping dictionary entries into appropriate inflected forms (final '''generation'''):

:::A girl eats an apple. =&gt; Ein Mädchen isst einen Apfel.

== Components ==

The RBMT system contains:

* a '''SL morphological analyser''' - analyses a source language word and provides the morphological information;
* a '''SL parser''' - is a syntax analyser which analyses source language sentences;
* a '''translator''' - used to translate a source language word into the target language;
* a '''TL morphological generator''' - works as a generator of appropriate target language words for the given grammatica information;
* a '''TL parser''' - works as a composer of suitable target language sentences;
* '''Several dictionaries''' - more specifically a minimum of three dictionaries:

::a ''SL dictionary'' - needed by the source language morphological analyser for morphological analysis,

::a ''bilingual dictionary'' - used by the translator to translate source language words into target language words,

::a ''TL dictionary'' - needed by the target language morphological generator to generate target language words.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&amp;arnumber=6075022 | title = Computational Model of Grammar for English to  Sinhala Machine Translation | last1 = Hettige | first1 = B. | last2 = Karunananda | first2 = A.S. |year = 2011 | work = The International Conference on Advances in ICT for Emerging Regions - ICTer20 11 : 026-031 | accessdate = 20 June 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The RBMT system makes use of the following:

* a '''Source Grammar''' for the input language which builds syntactic constructions from input sentences;
* a '''Source Lexicon''' which captures all of the allowable vocabulary in the domain;
* '''Source Mapping Rules''' which indicate how syntactic heads and grammatical functions in the source language are mapped onto domain concepts and semantic roles in the interlingua;
* a '''Domain Model'''/'''Ontology''' which defines the classes of domain concepts and restricts the fillers of semantic roles for each class;
* '''Target Mapping Rules''' which indicate how domain concepts and semantic roles in the interlingua are mapped onto syntactic heads and grammatical functions in the target language;
* a '''Target Lexicon''' which contains appropriate target lexemes for each domain concept;
* a '''Target Grammar''' for the target language which realizes target syntactic constructions as linearized output sentences.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.springerlink.com/content/v51w13n70m145786/fulltext.pdf | title = Acquisition of Large Lexicons for Practical Knowledge-Based MT | last1 = Lonsdale | first1 = Deryle | last2 = Mitamura | first2 = Teruko | last3 = Nyberg | first3 = Eric |year = 1995 | work = Machine Translation 9: 251-283 | publisher = Kluwer Academic Publishers | accessdate = 20 June 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Advantages ==
* No [[parallel text|bilingual texts]] are required. This makes it possible to create translation systems for languages that have no texts in common, or even no digitized data whatsoever.
* Domain independent. Rules are usually written in a domain independent manner, so the vast majority of rules will "just work" in every domain, and only a few specific cases per domain may need rules written for them.
* No quality ceiling. Every error can be corrected with a targeted rule, even if the trigger case is extremely rare. This is in contrast to statistical systems where infrequent forms will be washed away by default.
* Total control. Because all rules are hand-written, you can easily debug a rule based system to see exactly where a given error enters the system, and why.
* Reusability. Because RBMT systems are generally built from a strong source language analysis that is fed to a transfer step and target language generator, the source language analysis and target [[natural language generation|language generation]] parts can be shared between multiple translation systems, requiring only the transfer step to be specialized. Additionally, source language analysis for one language can be reused to bootstrap a closely related language analysis.

==Shortcomings==

* Insufficient amount of really good dictionaries. Building new dictionaries is expensive.
* Some linguistic information still needs to be set manually. 
* It is hard to deal with rule interactions in big systems, ambiguity, and idiomatic expressions. 
* Failure to adapt to new domains. Although RBMT systems usually provide a mechanism to create new rules and extend and adapt the lexicon, changes are usually very costly and the results, frequently, do not pay off.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.aclweb.org/anthology/N/N09/N09-2055.pdf | title = Statistical Post-Editing of a Rule-Based Machine Translation System | last1 = Lagarda | first1 = A.-L. | last2 = Alabau | first2 = V. | last3 = Casacuberta | first3 = F. | last4 = Silva | first4 = R. | last5 = D&amp;iacute;az-de-Lia&amp;ntilde;o | first5 = E. | year = 2009 | work = Proceedings of NAACL HLT 2009: Short Papers, pages 217–220, Boulder, Colorado |publisher = Association for Computational Linguistics | accessdate = 20 June 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5367">'''Segal's Burnside ring conjecture''', or, more briefly, the '''Segal conjecture''', is a [[theorem]] in [[homotopy theory]], a branch of [[mathematics]]. The theorem relates the [[Burnside ring]] of a finite [[Group (mathematics)|group]] ''G'' to the [[cohomotopy group|stable cohomotopy]] of the [[classifying space]] ''BG''. The conjecture was made in the mid 1970s by [[Graeme Segal]] and proved in 1984 by [[Gunnar Carlsson]]. {{As of|2016}}, this statement is still commonly referred to as the Segal conjecture, even though it now has the status of a theorem.

==Statement of the theorem==
The Segal conjecture has several different formulations, not all of which are equivalent. Here is a weak form: there exists, for every finite group ''G'', an isomorphism 
:&lt;math&gt;\varprojlim \pi_S^0(BG^{(k)}_+) \to \hat{A}(G).&lt;/math&gt;
Here, lim denotes the [[inverse limit]], &amp;pi;&lt;sub&gt;S&lt;/sub&gt;* denotes the stable cohomotopy ring, ''B'' denotes the classifying space, the superscript ''k'' denotes the ''k''-[[CW-complex|skeleton]], and the subscript + denotes the addition of a disjoint basepoint. On the right-hand side, the hat denotes the [[topological ring#Completion|completion]] of the Burnside ring with respect to its [[augmentation ideal]].

==The Burnside ring==
{{Main|Burnside ring}}

The Burnside ring of a finite group ''G'' is constructed from the category of finite [[group action|''G''-sets]] as a [[Grothendieck group]]. More precisely, let ''M(G)'' be the commutative [[monoid]] of isomorphism classes of finite ''G''-sets, with addition the disjoint union of ''G''-sets and identity element the empty set (which is a ''G''-set in a unique way). Then ''A(G)'', the Grothendieck group of ''M(G)'', is an abelian group. It is in fact a [[free abelian group|free]] abelian group with basis elements represented by the ''G''-sets ''G''/''H'', where ''H'' varies over the subgroups of ''G''. (Note that ''H'' is not assumed here to be a normal subgroup of ''G'', for while ''G''/''H'' is not a group in this case, it is still a ''G''-set.) The [[ring (mathematics)|ring]] structure on ''A(G)'' is induced by the direct product of ''G''-sets; the multiplicative identity is the (isomorphism class of any) one-point set, which becomes a ''G''-set in a unique way.

The Burnside ring is the analogue of the [[representation ring]] in the category of finite sets, as opposed to the category of finite-dimensional [[vector space]]s over a [[Field (mathematics)|field]] (see [[#Motivation and interpretation|motivation]] below). It has proven to be an important tool in the [[group representation|representation theory]] of finite groups.

==The classifying space==
{{Main|Classifying space}}
For any [[topological group]] ''G'' admitting the structure of a [[CW-complex]], one may consider the category of [[principal bundle|principal ''G''-bundles]]. One can define a [[functor]] from the category of CW-complexes to the category of sets by assigning to each CW-complex ''X'' the set of principal ''G''-bundles on ''X''. This functor descends to a functor on the homotopy category of CW-complexes, and it is natural to ask whether the functor so obtained is [[representable functor|representable]]. The answer is affirmative, and the representing object is called the classifying space of the group ''G'' and typically denoted ''BG''. If we restrict our attention to the homotopy category of CW-complexes, then ''BG'' is unique. Any CW-complex that is homotopy equivalent to ''BG'' is called a ''model'' for ''BG''.

For example, if ''G'' is the group of order 2, then a model for ''BG'' is infinite-dimensional real projective space. It can be shown that if ''G'' is finite, then any CW-complex modelling ''BG'' has cells of arbitrarily large dimension. On the other hand, if ''G'' = '''Z''', the integers, then the classifying space ''BG'' is homotopy equivalent to the circle ''S''&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;.

==Motivation and interpretation==
The content of the theorem becomes somewhat clearer if it is placed in its historical context. In the theory of representations of finite groups, one can form an object &lt;math&gt;R[G]&lt;/math&gt; called the representation ring of &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt; in a way entirely analogous to the construction of the Burnside ring outlined above. The stable [[cohomotopy group|cohomotopy]] is in a sense the natural analog to complex [[K-theory]], which is denoted &lt;math&gt;KU^*&lt;/math&gt;. Segal was inspired to make his conjecture after [[Michael Atiyah]] proved the existence of an isomorphism
:&lt;math&gt;KU^0(BG) \to \hat{R}[G]&lt;/math&gt;
which is a special case of the [[Atiyah–Segal completion theorem]].

'''Shahrokh Meskoob''' ({{lang-fa|شاهرخ مسکوب}}) (January 11, 1924&lt;ref&gt;https://iranchehr.com/?p=8748&lt;/ref&gt; in [[Babol]], [[Iran]] – April 12, 2005 in [[Paris]], [[France]]), was an [[Iran]]ian writer, translator, scholar and university professor.

==Life==
Meskoob was born in the city of [[Babol]] in north of Iran. He started reading novels and literature since he just finished the primary school.

He then continued his school in [[Isfahan]] and then returned to [[Tehran]] in 1945 to study law in the [[University of Tehran]]. Three years later he graduated from law school and started his activities in leftist political  parties.

In March 1955 he was jailed and tortured. Two things kept him alive while he was prisoned; his mother and his close friend [[:w:fa:مرتضی کیوان|Morteza Keyvan]] who was executed. Shahrokh Meskoob was released in May 1957. From 1959 until the 1979 [[Iranian revolution]], he worked for different government sectors.

After the revolution, he moved to [[Europe]] and spent most of his time in France. He died on April 12, 2005 in [[Paris]], aged 81.

==Works==
Shahrokh Meskoob (Ph.D.) is the first Iranian scholar who worked on [[Ferdowsi]]'s [[Shahnameh]] on the basis of the principles of modern [[literary criticism]]. Among his most famous books is ''Soog-e Siavash'', which is based on [[Siyâvash|Siavash]] character of Shahnameh.

His major published works include translations of [[Sophocles]]' [[Antigone]], [[Oedipus Rex]], and Steinbeck's  [[The Grapes of Wrath|Grapes of Wrath]]; he has also written Moqaddame-'i bar Rostam va Esfandiar (a study of the ethics of Ferdowsi's Shahnameh); Soug-e Siavosh (a study of the myth of martyrdom and resurrection in the Shahnameh); and Dar kuy-e dust (an interpretive study of [[Hafez]]'s views on man, nature, love, and ethics).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Iranian Nationality and the Persian Language|url=http://www.mage.com/history/iranian-nationality-and-the-persian-language.html|publisher=Mage Publishers}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Plot==
"Story of Your Life" is narrated by [[Linguistics|linguist]] Dr. Louise Banks the day her daughter is conceived. Addressed to her daughter, the story alternates between recounting the past: the coming of the aliens and the deciphering of their language; and remembering the future: what will happen to her unborn daughter as she grows up, and the daughter's untimely death.

The aliens arrived in spaceships and entered Earth's orbit. 112 devices resembling large semi-circular mirrors appeared at sites across the globe. Dubbed "looking glasses", they were [[audiovisual]] links to the aliens in orbit, who were called heptapods for their seven-limbed [[Symmetry in biology#Radial symmetry|radially symmetrical]] appearance. Louise and [[physicist]] Dr. Gary Donnelly were recruited by the U.S. Army to communicate with the aliens, and were assigned to one of nine looking glass sites in the US. They made contact with two heptapods they nicknamed Flapper and Raspberry. In an attempt to learn their language, Louise began by associating objects and gestures with sounds the aliens made, which revealed a language with [[Word order#Pragmatic word order|free word order]] and many levels of [[Center embedding|center-embedded]] clauses. She found their writing to be chains of [[Determinative|semagram]]s on a two-dimensional surface in no linear sequence, and [[Semasiography|semasiographic]], having no reference to speech. Louise concluded that, because their speech and writing are unrelated, the heptapods have two languages, which she called Heptapod A ([[Spoken language|speech]]) and Heptapod B ([[Written language|writing]]).

Attempts were also made to establish heptapod terminology in physics. Little progress was made, until a presentation of [[Fermat's principle|Fermat's Principle of Least Time]] was given. Gary explained the principle to Louise, giving the example of the [[refraction|refraction of light]], and that light will always take the fastest possible route. Louise reasoned, "[a] ray of light has to know where it will ultimately end up before it can choose the direction to begin moving in."{{sfn|Chiang|2015a|p=101}} She knew the heptapods did not write a sentence one semagram at a time, but drew all the [[ideogram]]s simultaneously, suggesting they knew what the entire sentence would be beforehand. Louise realized that instead of experiencing events sequentially ([[causality]]), heptapods experience all events at once ([[teleology]]). This reflected in their language, and explained why Fermat's principle came naturally to them.

Soon, Louise became quite proficient at Heptapod B, and found that when writing in it, trains of thought were directionless, and premises and conclusions interchangeable. She found herself starting to think in Heptapod B and began to see time as heptapods do. Louise saw glimpses of her future and of a daughter she did not yet have. This raised questions about the nature of [[free will]]: knowledge of the future would imply no free will, because knowing the future means it cannot be changed. But Louise asked herself, "What if the experience of knowing the future changed a person? What if it evoked a sense of urgency, a sense of obligation to act precisely as she knew she would?"{{sfn|Chiang|2015a|p=106}}

One day, after an information exchange with the heptapods, the aliens announced they were leaving. They shut down the looking glasses and their ships disappeared. It was never established why they left, or why they had come in the first place. The heptapod languages changed Louise's life, and once she knew the future, she never acted contrary to that future. Gary and Louise start spending time together and eventually marry. When Gary asks Louise if she wants a baby, she agrees, knowing that they will divorce, and their daughter will die young.

==Background==
In the "Story Notes" section of ''[[Stories of Your Life and Others]]'', Chiang wrote that inspiration for "Story of Your Life" came from his fascination in the [[variational principle]] in physics. When he saw American actor [[Paul Linke]]'s performance in his play ''Time Flies When You’re Alive'', about his wife's struggle with breast cancer, Chiang realized he could use this principle to show how someone deals with the inevitable.{{sfn|Chiang|2015b|p=223}} Regarding the theme of the story, Chiang said that [[Kurt Vonnegut]] summed it up in his introduction in the 25th anniversary edition of his novel ''[[Slaughterhouse-Five]]'':

&lt;blockquote&gt;[[Stephen Hawking]] ... found it tantalizing that we could not remember the future. But remembering the future is child's play for me now. I know what will become of my helpless, trusting babies because they are grown-ups now. I know how my closest friends will end up because so many of them are retired or dead now ... To Stephen Hawking and all others younger than myself I say, "Be patient. Your future will come to you and lie down at your feet like a dog who knows and likes you no matter what you are."{{sfn|Chiang|2015b|p=223}}
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In a 2010 interview Chiang said that "Story of Your Life" addresses the subject of free will. The philosophical debates about whether or not we have free will are all abstract, but knowing the future makes the question very real. Chiang added, "If you know what's going to happen, can you keep it from happening? Even when a story says that you can't, the emotional impact arises from the feeling that you should be able to."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Solomon |first=Avi |url=https://medium.com/learning-for-life/stories-of-ted-chiangs-life-and-others-694cb3c80d13#.8850rurw0 |title=Stories of Ted Chiang's Life and Others: An interview with the wisest, smartest scifi writer there is |publisher=[[Medium (website)|Medium.com]] |date=January 29, 2014 |accessdate=March 8, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Chiang spent five years researching and familiarizing himself in the field of linguistics before attempting to write "Story of Your Life."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.npr.org/2016/11/11/501202681/arrival-authors-approach-to-science-fiction-slow-steady-and-successful|title='Arrival' Author's Approach To Science Fiction?

== Reception ==
In ''[[The New York Review of Books]]'' American author [[James Gleick]] said that "Story of Your Life" poses the questions: would knowing your future be a gift or a curse, and is free will simply an illusion? Gleick wrote "For us ordinary mortals, the day-to-day experience of a preordained future is almost unimaginable", but Chiang does just that in this story, he "imagine[s] it".&lt;ref name=Gleick&gt;{{cite newspaper |last=Gleick |first=James |authorlink=James Gleick |url=http://www.nybooks.com/articles/2017/01/19/when-they-came-from-another-world/ |title=When They Came from Another World |newspaper=[[The New York Review of Books]] |date=January 19, 2017 |accessdate=March 10, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a review of Chiang's ''[[Stories of Your Life and Others]]'' in ''[[The Guardian]]'', English fantasy author [[China Miéville]] described "Story of Your Life" as "tender" with an "astonishingly moving culmination", which he said is "surprising" considering it is achieved using science.&lt;ref name=Mieville&gt;{{cite newspaper |last=Miéville |first=China |authorlink=China Miéville |url=https://www.theguardian.com/books/2004/apr/24/featuresreviews.guardianreview23/ |title=Stories of Your Life |newspaper=[[The Guardian]] |date=April 24, 2004 |accessdate=March 10, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Writing in ''[[Kirkus Reviews]]'' Ana Grilo called it a "thought-provoking, beautiful story".&lt;ref name=Grilo&gt;{{cite newspaper |last=Grilo |first=Ana |url=https://www.kirkusreviews.com/features/contrast-and-compare-iarrivali-and-story-your-life/ |title=Contrast and Compare: ''Arrival'' and 'Story of Your Life' |newspaper=[[Kirkus Reviews]] |date=November 25, 2016 |accessdate=March 10, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; He said that in contrast to the familiar fare of lavish stories involving aliens, "Story of Your Life" is "a breath of fresh air" whose objective "is to not only to learn how to communicate but how to communicate ''effectively''."&lt;ref name=Grilo/&gt; In a review in ''Emertainment Monthly'' Samantha Schraub said that the story's two narratives, Louise recalling the unraveling of the heptapods' language, and telling her yet-to-be-born daughter what will happen to her, creates "an ambiguity and air of mystery, which make the reader question everything that unfolds".&lt;ref name=Schraub&gt;{{cite newspaper |last=Schraub |first=Samantha |url=http://emertainmentmonthly.com/index.php/review-story-life/ |title=Review: "Story of Your Life" |newspaper=Emertainment Monthly |date=December 13, 2016 |accessdate=March 10, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Schraub called it "an award-worthy science fiction novella that will resonate with readers, and leave them thinking how they would live—or even change—their present, if they knew their future."&lt;ref name=Schraub/&gt;

{{Refimprove|date=March 2012}}{{Globalize/US|date=March 2012}}
In [[law enforcement jargon]], a '''suspect''' is a known person accused or suspected of committing a [[crime]]. Police and reporters in the [[United States]] often use the word '''suspect''' as a jargon when referring to the '''perpetrator''' of the offense ('''perp''' in dated US slang). However, in official definition, the perpetrator is the robber, assailant, [[counterfeiter]], etc.—the person who committed the crime. The distinction between suspect and perpetrator recognizes that the suspect is not ''known'' to have committed the offense, while the perpetrator—who may not yet have been suspected of the crime, and is thus not necessarily a suspect—is the one who did. The suspect may be a different person from the perpetrator, or there may have been no actual crime, which would mean there is no perpetrator.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theatlantic.com/issues/97jul/9707wdct.htm |title=Word Court |publisher=Theatlantic.com |date= |accessdate=2012-03-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A common error in police reports is a witness description of the suspect (as a witness generally describes a perpetrator, while a [[mug shot]] is of  suspect). Frequently it is stated that police are looking for the suspect, when there is no suspect; the police ''could'' be looking for a suspect, but they are surely looking for the perpetrator, and very often it is impossible to tell from such a police report whether there is a suspect or not.

Possibly because of the misuse of suspect to mean perpetrator, police in the early 21st century began to use '''[[person of interest]]''', '''possible suspect''', and even '''possible person of interest''',  to mean suspect.

Under the judicial systems of the [[United States|U.S.]], once a decision is approved to [[arrest]] a suspect, or bind him over for [[trial (law)|trial]], either by a [[prosecutor]] issuing an [[Information (formal criminal charge)|information]], a [[grand jury]] issuing a [[true bill]] or [[indictment]], or a [[judge]] issuing an [[arrest warrant]], the suspect can then be properly called a [[defendant]], or the accused. Only after being [[convicted]] is the suspect properly called the perpetrator.

'''Time-late''' is a term used primarily in [[naval warfare]] that refers to the time lag between some datum's generation and actions taken based on it.  In other words, it is something that is not [[Real-time (disambiguation)|real-time.]]

It is often used in the context of a weapon's time of flight: the time between launch and (intended) contact with a target results in a time-late.

In [[real estate]] business and law, a '''title search''' or '''property title search''' is the process of retrieving documents evidencing events in the history of a piece of [[real property]], to determine relevant interests in and regulations concerning that property.

In the case of a prospective purchase, a title search is performed primarily to answer three questions regarding a property on the market:
* Does the seller have a saleable and marketable interest in the property?
* What kind of restrictions or allowances pertain to the use of the land? These would include [[real covenant]]s, [[easements]] and other [[equitable servitude]]s.
* Do any liens exist on the property which need to be paid off at closing? These would be [[Mortgage loan|mortgages]], back [[taxes]], [[mechanic's lien]]s, and other assessments.

A title search is also performed when an owner wishes to mortgage property and the bank requires the owner to insure this transaction.

Anyone may do a title search, with the right knowledge and resources. Documents concerning [[conveyancing|conveyances]] of land are a matter of [[public record]]. These documents are maintained in hard copy paper format or sometimes scanned into image files. The information within the documents is typically not available as data format as the records are descriptions of legal events which contain terms, conditions, and language in excess of data.

== Typical process ==
Generally, there are two main types of title searching, a full coverage search and limited coverage search; other types include non-insured reports and foreclosure guarantee search.

It is often the case that people choose to contact a title company or attorney to conduct an exhaustive title search. The process of performing a title search involves accessing the official land records for the subject property. Each record is a document evidencing an event which occurred in the history of the property. A deed records an event of property transfer, a mortgage documents the collateral interest of a home loan, and a lien documents a claim against the property in favor of another, such as a creditor, vendor, or tradesman.  The objective of the title search is to establish clear, marketable title by exposing any outstanding claims prior to transfer of title.

Each recorded document must name the parties involved, e.g., grantor and grantee. The grantor is the party transferring away a property right, and the grantee is receiving a property right. In the case of a deed the grantor would typically be the property seller, and the grantee the buyer. A mortgage grantor or mortgagor is the borrower of the loan, since they are giving away certain property rights to the mortgagee, lender, or mortgage grantee.  More recent wording simplifies this language with "Borrower" and "Lender."

The records are kept in a centralized government office, usually at the county courthouse (in states with strong county governments such as Washington State or Massachusetts, the title on the door would be something like Registrar of Deeds or County Recorder); or in the municipal offices (in small states such as Connecticut, Vermont, and Rhode Island), often the title searcher must go to each individual town or county office to research the title.

The process of a title search begins with searching for and retrieving each physical document from the books which contain them. Every document is recorded by date in a special set of volumes called by various names such as Grantor-Grantee index, Land Records or Deed Records), which may or may not be digitized or scanned into a searchable file, depending on the financial resources of the county or town.  An official stamp located usually at the bottom of the first page gives the name of the recording official, date, time, book and page number. If the document has been recorded, this stamp will ALWAYS be there.

The collected documents are then reviewed and analyzed to see how each affects the property, and which documents have been released by subsequent recordings. Contingent conditions within documents such as life estates and remainder interests may exist within the document language. This process is often performed by a trained professional called a title abstractor. Some title abstractors have certifications documenting their experience level and training and successfully having passed an exam.

The document produced by a title abstractor is called a title abstract, or abstract of title. This is not a document which exists in public records, but it is derived from recorded documents. The title abstract is provided to the title company, attorney, or end-user by the abstractor.

For example, a title report may also show any easements, or recorded encumbrances against the property or portions of the property.  A previous owner may have legally given a neighbor the right to share the driveway, or the city may have a right to strips of the property for putting power lines, communication lines, water pipes, or sewer pipes. A few on-line services offer title searches for relatively little cost, and their accuracy is not inferior to what a title company or attorney will offer; however on-line businesses rely mostly on electronically available information, and for that reason could at times be limited both in completeness and geographical availability.

A [[full coverage search]] is usually done when creating a title report for sale/resale transactions and for transaction that involves [[construction loan]]s. It generally includes searches related to property [[lien]], [[easement]]s, [[Restrictive covenant|covenants, conditions and restrictions(CC&amp;Rs)]], [[Contract|agreements]], [[Resolution (law)|resolutions]] and [[Local ordinance|ordinances]] that will affect the [[real property]] in question.
#Search for liens against the owner and the other parties on title.
#Search for liens against the buyer (for sale transactions only).
#Search for [[Bankruptcy]] and [[Judgement]] proceedings against the owner of the property.
#Search for liens against the buyer is not something that is covered in a title search.

=== Limited coverage search ===

A limited coverage search is usually making title reports for refinance transactions that involves [[ownership equity]] loans and for making simple title guarantee reports.

This kind of title searching usually includes searches for property liens, liens against the owner and the other parties on title and search for [[bankruptcy]] proceedings against the owner of the property.

==Title insurance==
In the United States, the buyer of a property will usually purchase [[title insurance]], which protects the buyer from any title problems that may arise after sale, such as liens that were missed during the title search.  The title insurance company issues a report and an insurance policy in support of its findings. However, title searches are most often carried out before contracting is completed between parties, and sometimes during the [[escrow]] phase of a closing.

There are a variety of title searches which provide the customer with a report, but no insurance.  These are for informational purposes only, and are called by a variety of names, such as Lot Book Report, Plat Certificate, 300-foot Radius Report, and others.  These informational searches are used mainly in two instances:
* [[Probate]].  This is when a family, lawyer, or court is dividing up the property of a deceased person.  Heirs will want to know what liens they are taking on and who has rights to the land.
* [[Subdivision (land)|Subdividing]].  To create a subdivision, a person takes land previously platted (legally named and recorded) under another name and renames and re-plats it as a new development or subdivision.  A report must be given to the city, showing taxes and liens paid.  The owner can then sell the lots individually or en masse, and may record Covenants, Conditions, and Restrictions, which govern how residents may construct their houses or yards, and may limit other activities.  Many subdivisions have noise, pet, and trash regulations as well.

==Foreclosure guarantee search==
A foreclosure guarantee is a type of report (e.g. [[trustees sale guarantee]], [[judicial foreclosure guarantee]] and [[litigation guarantee]]) that is used mainly for foreclosing an encumbrances (or a lien) in a certain property. The title searcher will perform a full coverage search to the property in default and a search for the addresses of the lien holders to the property in default. The addresses will be used for sending copies of the notice of foreclosure letters (such as [[notice of trustees sale]], etc.) to the lien holders to the property in default.

==Property title search before foreclosure sale==
A home [[foreclosure]] is often linked with [[lien]]s held by banks or governmental agencies. Multiple liens from various sources may be held against a property in foreclosure. If a home is sold at a foreclosure auction, the proceeds are divided and paid to lienholders in order of filing until all proceeds are expended.

[[Public auction]]s (also known as sheriff’s sales or foreclosure auctions) are typically held in the municipal or county courts, which neither guarantee an unencumbered title nor offer protection to buyers against additional liens on the property.
