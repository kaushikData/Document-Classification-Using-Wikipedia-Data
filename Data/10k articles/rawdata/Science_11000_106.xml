The '''Barnett effect''' is the [[magnetization]] of an uncharged body when spun on its axis.&lt;ref name="Blaine"&gt;{{cite book |title=The Cold Universe |author=Bruce T. Draine |editor1=Andrew W. Blain |editor2=F. Combes |editor3=Bruce T. Draine |editor4=D.

An uncharged object rotating with angular velocity ω tends to spontaneously magnetize, with a magnetization given by:

:&lt;math&gt;M=\chi \omega / \gamma \ , &lt;/math&gt;

with γ = [[gyromagnetic ratio]] for the material, χ = [[magnetic susceptibility]].

The magnetization occurs parallel to the axis of spin.  Barnett was motivated by a prediction by [[Owen Richardson]] in 1908, later named the [[Einstein–de Haas effect]], that magnetizing a ferromagnet can induce a mechanical rotation. He instead looked for the opposite effect, that is, that spinning a ferromagnet could change its magnetization.  He established the effect with a long series of experiments between 1908 and 1915.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4743">'''Benjamin Ayres''' (died c. 1775) was an [[English people|English]] instrument maker.

Ayres may have been related to the scientist Thomas Ayres who was nominated to the [[Royal Society]] in 1707 and who was later involved in a joint stock company to exploit the [[Newcomen steam engine]].{{sfn|Stewart|199|p=145}}
Ayres was an apprentice and brother-in-law of [[Jonathan Sisson]] of [[London]].{{sfn|Bruyns|2008}}

Ayres was active between 1731 and 1775, making mathematical instruments and compasses.{{sfn|Mariner's compass in gimbals...}}
He worked in [[Amsterdam]] from 1743 onward, and sold [[Octant (instrument)|octant]]s to the [[Dutch East India Company]].
His devices incorporate technical innovations introduced by Sisson, which were copied by others only after 1750.
Some of them were included in the collection of instruments made by [[Gerard Arnout Hasselaer]], a board member of the company.{{sfn|Bruyns|2008}}
Hasselaer had connections with both Ayres and Sisson.{{sfn|Raat|2010|p=161}}

In 1734 Caleb Smith invented a "sea quadrant" using an unsilvered glass mirror to reflect the image of the sun into the telescope.  Ayres produced an instrument based on this design mounted on gimbals over a magnetic compass, with a spirit level for use when the horizon was not visible, 
the whole contained in a solid wooden case.{{sfn|Lasater|2008|p=362}}

Around 1750 Ayres invented and made a sailors' arithmetical instrument, now held in the University Museum of Utrecht.
It consisted of a brass disk on which a number of circular logarithmic scales were inscribed, with two radial wires that could each be locked to a point on the circumference.
Using this instrument, a sailor could perform various trigonometric calculations by setting the wire to the position of the argument on one of the circular scales and reading the result from another of the circular scales.{{sfn|Poelje|2010}}

Ayres made fine, large [[Azimuth compass]]es, used in determining how much the magnetic compass deviated from true north.{{sfn|Turner|1980|p=34}}
A brass mariner's compass in gimbals set in mahogany box, made by Ayres in Amsterdam around 1775, is said to have been the property of Sir [[Isaac Newton]].{{sfn|Mariner's compass in gimbals...}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="11240">'''Codes for electromagnetic scattering by spheres'''  - this article list codes for electromagnetic scattering by a homogeneous sphere, layered sphere, and cluster of spheres. 

==Solution techniques==
Majority of existing codes for calculation of electromagnetic scattering by a single sphere is based on [[Mie theory]] which is an analytical solution of Maxwell's equations in terms of infinite series. Other approximations to scattering by a single sphere include: [[Debye series]], [[ray tracing (physics)|ray tracing]] ([[geometrical optics]]), ray tracing including the effects of interference between rays, [[Airy theory]], [[Rayleigh scattering]], diffraction approximation. There are many phenomena related to light scattering by spherical particles such as resonances, surface waves, plasmons, near-field scattering. Even though Mie theory offers convenient and fast way of solving light scattering problem by homogeneous spherical particles, there are other techniques, such as [[discrete dipole approximation]], FDTD, T-matrix, which can also be used for such tasks.

| MiePlot offers the following mathematical models for the scattering of light by a sphere: Mie solutions, Debye series, ray tracing (based on geometrical optics), ray tracing including the effects of interference between rays, Airy theory, Rayleigh scattering, diffraction, surface waves.  In addition to single-wavelength calculations, MiePlot can also perform calculations for a number of wavelengths, thus approximating a continuous spectrum (such as sunlight) to produce simulations of atmospheric optical effects such as rainbows, coronas and glories.

Code is also available for calculating the analytical derivatives of Mie scattering (i.e. the derivative of the extinction and scattering coefficients, and the intensity functions with respect to size parameter and complex refractive index). The routines are written in [[IDL (programming language)|IDL]], but a Fortran-based DLM version (which substantially reduces runtime) of the single-sphere code is also available.

[[File:Cubanseabreezeconvergence.gif|thumb|[[Mesoscale meteorology|Mesoscale]] [[sea breeze]]s in [[Cuba]] converge from both coasts to form lines of cumulus.]]

A '''convergence zone''' in [[meteorology]] is a region in the [[atmosphere]] where two prevailing flows meet and interact, usually resulting in distinctive weather conditions.&lt;ref name=HK&gt;
{{cite web 
| url= http://www.hko.gov.hk/education/edu01met/wxphe/ele-condiv-e.htm 
| title= Meteorology Basics: Convergence and Divergence 
| author = LEUNG Wai-hung  | date=  June 2010 
| publisher = [[Hong Kong Observatory]] 
| accessdate= November 25, 2015
}}
&lt;/ref&gt;
This causes a mass accumulation that eventually leads to a vertical movement and to the formation of [[cloud]]s and [[precipitation]].&lt;ref name=HK/&gt; Large-scale convergence, called [[synoptic scale | synoptic-scale]] convergence, is associated with weather systems such as [[Trough (meteorology)|baroclinic troughs]], [[low-pressure area]]s, and [[cyclone]]s. Small-scale convergence will give phenomena from isolated [[cumulus cloud]]s to large areas of [[thunderstorm]]s.

The inverse of a convergence is a [[divergence]].

== Large scale ==
[[File:Convergence zones.jpg|thumb|308px]]
An example of a convergence zone is the [[Intertropical Convergence Zone]] (ITCZ), a [[low pressure area]] which girdles the [[Earth]] at the [[Equator]]. Another example is the [[South Pacific convergence zone]] that extends from the western [[Pacific Ocean]] toward [[French Polynesia]].

== Mesoscale ==
Convergence zones also occur at a smaller scale. Some examples are the [[Puget Sound Convergence Zone]] which occurs in the [[Puget Sound]] region in the U.S. state of Washington; [[Mohawk–Hudson convergence]] in the U.S. state of New York; the Elsinore Convergence Zone in the U.S. state of California; the [[Brown Willy effect]] which can be generated when south-westerly winds blow over [[Bodmin Moor]] in [[Cornwall]]; and the [[Pembrokeshire Dangler]] which can form when northerly winds blow down the [[Irish Sea]]. They can also be associated with [[sea breeze]] fronts.

If, in one constituent quark, the current quark is hit inside the covering with large force, it accelerates through the covering and leaves it behind.{{citation needed|date=July 2012}} In addition, current quarks possess one [[asymptotic freedom]] within the [[perturbation theory]] described limits. In [[quantum chromodynamics]], the mass of the current quarks carries the designation ''current quark mass''.

A description is only possible with the help of [[relativistic quantum mechanics]].

==Current quark mass==
The current quark mass is also called the mass of the 'naked' quarks.
The mass of the current quark is reduced by the term of the [[constituent quark covering]] mass.

The current quark mass is a logical consequence of the mathematical formalism of the [[quantum field theory]] (QFT), 
thus it is from a not descriptive origin.
The current quark masses of the light current quarks are much smaller than the [[constituent quark mass]]es.  
Reason for this is the missing of the mass of the constituent quark covering.
  
The current quark mass is a parameter to compute sufficiently small color charges.

''Definition'':
The current quark mass means the mass of the constituent quark mass reduced by the mass of the respective constituent quark covering.

There is almost no difference between current quark mass and constituent quark mass for the heavy [[quarks]] (c,b,t).This is not so for the light quarks (u, d, s).

The comparison of the results of the computations 
with the experimental data supplies the values for the current quark masses.

The '''DARPA Spectrum Challenge''' was a competition held by the [[Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency]] to demonstrate a radio protocol that can best use a given [[communication channel]] in the presence of other dynamic users and [[signal integrity|interfering signals]]. 

The Challenge was not focused on developing new radio hardware, but instead was targeted at finding strategies for guaranteeing successful communication in the presence of other radios that may have conflicting co-existence objectives. The Challenge entailed head-to-head competitions between each team's radio protocol and an opponent's in a structured wireless [[testbed]] environment, known as ORBIT, that is maintained by the Wireless Information Network Laboratory (WINLAB) at Rutgers University.

The Challenge awarded first place teams in the September 2013 preliminary event, and first and second place teams in the March 2014 final event with cash prizes totaling $200,000.  Each event consisted of a Competitive and Cooperative Tournament.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://archive.darpa.mil/spectrumchallenge/ |title=DARPA Spectrum Challenge |publisher=[[Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency]] |date= |accessdate=June 10, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release |publisher=[[Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency]] |title=SPECTRUM CHALLENGE FINAL EVENT HELPS PAVE THE WAY FOR MORE ROBUST, RESILIENT AND RELIABLE RADIO COMMUNICATIONS |url=http://www.darpa.mil/NewsEvents/Releases/2014/04/02.aspx |date=April 2, 2014 |accessdate=June 16, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |publisher=[[IEEE Spectrum]] |title=Radio Wrestlers Fight It Out at the DARPA Spectrum Challenge|url=http://spectrum.ieee.org/telecom/wireless/radio-wrestlers-fight-it-out-at-the-darpa-spectrum-challenge |date=April 9, 2014 |accessdate=July 7, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

DC Web Women began in 1999 as a chapter of [[Aliza Sherman|Webgrrls]].&lt;ref&gt;Laura Lambert, Hilary W. Poole, Chris Woodford, Christos J. P. Moschovitis. ''The Internet: A Historical Encyclopedia.'' ABC-CLIO, 2005, {{ISBN|1-85109-659-0}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The group was started in a coffee shop by Debbie Weil and Catherine Buzzel.&lt;ref name="about" /&gt; This initial meeting between the two women led to a second meeting in a women owned internet café in the Washington DC area with three additional like-minded women: Cathy Ganssle, Shellie Holubek, and Miriam Jaffe. This meeting led to the foundation of the organization DC Web Women.&lt;ref name="about" /&gt;

On February 15, 1999, the organization registered as a non-profit and was renamed to "DC Web Women."&lt;ref name="about" /&gt;

In [[economics]], '''diminishing returns''' is the decrease in the [[Marginalism|marginal]] (incremental) output of a [[production (economics)|production]] process as the amount of a single [[Factors of production|factor of production]] is incrementally increased, while the amounts of all other factors of production stay constant.

The law of diminishing returns states that in all productive processes, adding more of one factor of production, while holding all others constant ("''[[ceteris paribus]]''"), will at some point yield lower incremental per-unit returns.&lt;ref name=Samuelson2001p110&gt;{{cite book |first1=Paul A. |last1=Samuelson |author1-link=Paul Samuelson |first2=William D. |last2=Nordhaus |title=Microeconomics |publisher=McGraw-Hill |year=2001 |isbn=0071180664 |pages=110 |edition=17th}}&lt;/ref&gt; The law of diminishing returns does not imply that adding more of a factor will decrease the ''total'' production, a condition known as '''negative returns''', though in fact this is common.

A common example is adding more people to a job, such as the assembly of a car on a [[shop floor|factory floor]]. At some point, adding more workers causes problems such as workers getting in each other's way or frequently finding themselves waiting for access to a part. In all of these processes, producing one more unit of output per unit of time will eventually require increasingly more usage of the input, due to the input being used less effectively.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=George|first=Henry|title=The Science of Political Economy|publisher=Robert Schalkenbach Foundation|location=New York|url=http://schalkenbach.org/library/henry-george/science-of-political-economy/spe304.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another well-studied example is [[The Mythical Man-Month|throwing more headcount at software development]], yielding [[Brooks's law]]. 

The law of diminishing returns is a fundamental principle of economics.&lt;ref name=Samuelson2001p110/&gt; It plays a central role in [[production theory basics|production theory]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Encyclopædia Britannica|date=26 Jan 2013|publisher=Encyclopædia Britannica, Inc.|isbn=9781593392925|url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/163723/diminishing-returns}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
{{Expand section|date=December 2009}}

The concept of diminishing returns can be traced back to the concerns of early economists such as [[Johann Heinrich von Thünen]], [[Anne-Robert-Jacques Turgot, Baron de Laune|Jacques Turgot]], [[Adam Smith]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Smith|first=Adam|title=The wealth of nations|publisher=Thrifty books|isbn=9780786514854|url=https://www.amazon.com/The-Wealth-Nations-Adam-Smith/dp/1604598913}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[James Steuart (economist)|James Steuart]], [[Thomas Robert Malthus]], and [[David Ricardo]]. However, classical economists such as Malthus and Ricardo attributed the successive diminishment of output to the decreasing quality of the inputs. Neoclassical economists assume that each "unit" of labor is identical. Diminishing returns are due to the disruption of the entire productive process as additional units of labor are added to a fixed amount of capital. The law of diminishing returns remains an important consideration in farming.

==Example==
[[File:Total, Average, and Marginal Product.gif|thumb|right|As labor usage increases from L&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; to L&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, total output (measured vertically in the top graph) increases by the amount shown. But if labor usage is increased by the same amount again, output goes up by less, implying diminishing marginal returns to the use of labor as an input. The marginal product of labor (measured vertically in the bottom graph) is diminishing everywhere to the right of point A]]

An example is a factory that has a fixed stock of capital, or tools and machines, and a variable supply of labor. As the firm increases the number of workers, the total output of the firm grows but at an ever-decreasing rate. This is because after a certain point, the factory becomes overcrowded and workers begin to form lines to use the machines. The long-run solution to this problem is to increase the stock of capital, that is, to buy more machines and to build more factories.

==Returns and costs==
There is an inverse relationship between returns of inputs and the cost of production. Suppose that a kilogram of seed costs one [[dollar]], and this price does not change. Although there are other costs, assume they do not vary with the amount of output and are therefore [[fixed cost]]s. One kilogram of seeds yields one ton of crop, so the first ton of the crop costs one dollar to produce. That is, for the first ton of output, the [[marginal cost]] of the output is $1 per ton. If there are no other changes, then if the second kilogram of seeds applied to land produces only half the output of the first, the marginal cost would equal $1 per half ton of output, or $2 per ton. Similarly, if the third kilogram of seeds yields only a quarter ton, then the marginal cost equals $1 per quarter ton or $4 per ton. Thus, diminishing marginal returns imply increasing marginal costs and rising average costs.

Cost can also be measured in terms of [[opportunity cost]]. In this case the law also applies to societies – the opportunity cost of producing a single unit of a good generally increases as a society attempts to produce more of that good. This explains the bowed-out shape of the [[production possibilities frontier]].

'''The Young Scientist Challenge''' is a youth science and engineering competition administered by [[Discovery Education]] and [[3M]] for [[middle school]] students in the United States, similar to the [[European Union Contest for Young Scientists]]. Students apply by creating a 1-2 minute video detailing their idea for a new invention intended to solve an everyday problem. Ten finalists are chosen annually to work alongside a 3M scientist during a summer mentorship and receive a trip to the 3M Innovation Center in [[St. Paul, Minnesota]], to compete for $25,000 and the title of '''America’s Top Young Scientist'''.

== Selection process ==
The entry period is from December until April each year. A panel of judges from Discovery Education and its partner organizations, educators, and science professionals score qualifying entry videos and choose 10 finalists and up to 51 merit winners, one from each state and the [[District of Columbia]], based on the following criteria:
*Creativity (ingenuity and innovative thinking) (30%)
*Scientific knowledge (30%)
*Persuasiveness and effective communication (20%)
*Overall presentation (20%)

Students are required to address an everyday problem and articulate how the problem directly impacts them, their families, their communities, and/or the global population.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Carletta |url=http://www.eschoolnews.com/2013/04/09/discovery-education-and-3m-search-for-americas-2013-top-young-scientist/  |title=Discovery Education And 3M Search For America's 2013 Top Young Scientist |type=press release |website=eSchool News |date=April 9, 2013 |accessdate=December 4, 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=Heather |last=Weekley |url=http://www.columbusparent.com/content/blogs/the-daily-bulletin/2013/03/young-scientist.html |title=Is your youngster a budding scientist? Encourage them to enter a contest sponsored by 3M and Discovery Education |website=Columbus Parent |type=blog |date=March 1, 2013 |accessdate=December 4, 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The idea must be a new innovation or solution, and cannot be a behavioral change or a new use for an existing product. Judges also look for the level of understanding of scientific concepts and confidence in communicating science in general exhibited in the videos.

The ten finalists undergo a summer menotoship and in the fall travel to 3M's headquarters in Minnesota to participate in the Young Scientist Challenge Final Event. They visit 3M labs, meet 3M scientists, and tour the 3M Innovation Center, and also participate in a series of other scored challenges to demonstrate their scientific knowledge and communication abilities. For their final challenge, they then present the innovation that they developed during their mentorship. Here the finalists are judged by a panel of judges selected by Discovery Education and its partner organizations according to the following guidelines:

*Creativity (ingenuity and innovative thinking) demonstrated in the presentation (30%)
*Scientific knowledge demonstrated in the presentation (20%)
*Effective use of a 3M technology in the innovation (10%)
*Ranking from the Final Event's scored scientific challenges (40%)

After the Final Event, participants attend an award ceremony and dinner, at which the winner of the title "America’s Top Young Scientist" is announced.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Judging|url=http://www.youngscientistchallenge.com/judging|website=Discovery Education 3M Young Scientist Challenge|accessdate=October 15, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
Formerly known as the [[Discovery Channel Young Scientist Challenge]] (DCYSC), the Young Scientist challenge was created in 1999 as an engineering research and exhibit competition for students in grades 5 through 8.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first1=Nancy K. |last1=O'Leary |first2=Susan |last2=Shelly |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=bbbbt3PPMLEC&amp;pg=PA9#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |title=The Complete Idiot's Guide to Science Fair Projects |location=Indianapolis, Indiana |publisher=Alpha |year=2003 |isbn=9781592571376 |page=9 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It was sponsored primarily by [[Discovery Communications]], [[Society for Science and the Public]], and [[Elmer's Glue]]. Competitors were originally qualified for DCYSC by entering an [[Intel International Science and Engineering Fair|International Science and Engineering]]-affiliated [[science fair]] and being nominated by a teacher or professional.

Students completed an application that included several essays, which were then evaluated for communication abilities by DCYSC judges, who selected 400 semi-finalists and 40 finalists who received an all-expense-paid trip to [[Washington, D.C.]] to compete in the final competition. The finals consisted of two parts. The first was a research presentation, accounting for 20% of the total score, held at the [[Smithsonian]]'s [[National Museum of Natural History]], the [[National Academy of Sciences]], or another academic national association that varied from year to year. The second was a series of six science-related challenges at the [[National Institutes of Health]] or the [[University of Maryland]]. Each challenge concluded with some type of presentation (e.g., a radio show, a TV show, or a news conference) worth 10% of the students' total score. Students also presented a simple science experiment, known as a Whelmer, in front of cameras for 15% of their score. The remaining 5% came from teamwork, as the finalists were split into eight teams consisting of five members each for the science challenges.

In 2008 the contest became the Discovery Education 3M Young Scientist Challenge. Students no longer have to be nominated and now submit a 1-2 minute video clip as their form of entry.

== Challenge themes ==
Since 2003, themes for the Young Scientist Challenge have followed scientific curiosities and been built on the activities and innovations around them.
*In 2003, the activities were based on the 100th anniversary of the first flight of the [[Wright Brothers]] on December 17, 1903, and included a reproduction of the Wright Brother’s 1901 wind tunnel and lift balance, which allowed contestants to test various wing designs for lift, and rocket-propelled go carts powered by compressed carbon dioxide gas.
*In 2004, the activities were based on the 100th anniversary of [[Einstein's Theory of Relativity]], celebrated in the [[World Year of Physics 2005]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url=https://www.aps.org/publications/apsnews/200412/wyp.cfm |title=World Year of Physics Flies High At Young Scientist Challenge |journal=APS News |publisher=[[American Physical Society]] |date=December 2004 |volume=13 |issue=11 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
*In 2005, inspired by the events of [[Hurricane Katrina]] and the [[2004 Indonesian tsunami]], the activities were about understanding natural disasters&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=Mike |last=Hanlon |url=https://newatlas.com/go/4757/ |title=Discovery Channel Young Scientist Challenge finals underway |website=New Atlas |date=October 18, 2005 |accessdate=December 4, 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and included a 20-foot tall vortex (tornado) generator, a 40-foot tsunami wave tank simulator, and procedures to safely dispose of biological waste after a natural disaster.
*In 2006, the activities were based on the theme "Disease Detectives" inspired by the [[H5N1]] avian influenza scare. Contestants participated in virtual [[colonoscopy]] screening, mold identification and remediation, and avian flu containment using [[herd immunity]] models.
*In 2008, the activities centered on [[NASA]]-themed challenges. Finalists met NASA scientists and had the opportunity to work in a 1/6th gravity simulation, attempt a repair to the [[Hubble Telescope]], and look for water on [[Mars]].
*In 2009, the finalists went through four rounds of challenges based on the theme "The Science of Everyday Life".
*In 2010, activities focused on ways to keep humans safe. Contestants were judged on their knowledge of science and their ability to apply it to areas of safety and security.

An early conventional film (35&amp;nbsp;mm) camera was designed by [[Tessina]] that used the concept of folded optics.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5480">In [[digital physics]], the '''[[Edward Fredkin|Fredkin]] finite nature hypothesis''' states that ultimately all quantities of [[physics]], including [[space]] and [[time]], are [[Quantum|discrete]] and [[Wikt:finite|finite]]. All measurable physical quantities arise from some [[Planck scale]] substrate for [[information processing]]. Also, the amount of [[information]] in any small [[volume]] of [[spacetime]] will be finite and equal to a small number of possibilities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author=Fredkin, E. | title=Finite Nature | journal=Proceedings of the XXVIIth Rencontre de Moriond | year = 1992}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Conceptions==
{{Expand section|date=October 2010}}
[[Stephen Wolfram]] in ''[[A New Kind of Science]]'', Chapter 9, considered the possibility that [[energy]] and [[spacetime]] might be secondary derivations from an informational substrate underlying the [[Planck scale]]. Fredkin's "Finite Nature" and Wolfram's ideas on the foundations of [[physics]] might be relevant to [[unsolved problems in physics]].

==Fredkin's ideas on inertia==
According to Fredkin, "the computational substrate of quantum mechanics must have access to some sort of metric to create inertial motion. Whether or not higher level processes in physics can access this process is another story."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.digitalphilosophy.org/Home/Papers/FiniteNature/tabid/106/Default.aspx Fredkin's 1992 "Finite Nature" paper, chapter on "Consequences of Finite Nature"]&lt;/ref&gt; According to [[Edward Witten|Witten]], "string theory leads in a remarkably simple way to a reasonable rough draft of particle physics unified with gravity";&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Witten|first=Edward|title=ESSAY: Unravelling string theory|journal=Nature|volume=438| year=2005 |page=1085|url=http://www.sns.ias.edu/~witten/papers/Unravelling.pdf|bibcode = 2005Natur.438.1085W |doi = 10.1038/4381085a }}&lt;/ref&gt; if Fredkin is correct about inertia, then there is the highly controversial hypothesis that the foundations of physics might depend upon either string theory with the infinite nature hypothesis or some modified version of string theory with Fredkin's finite nature hypothesis, in which inertial mass-energy obeys [[Mordehai Milgrom|Milgrom]]'s [[modified Newtonian dynamics]] and not the [[equivalence principle]].

&lt;!--==M-theory with infinite, continuous nature versus M-theory with finite, digital nature==
According to [[Edward Witten]], perhaps the greatest mathematical problem in quantum field theory (QFT) is the "existence and mass gap" problem of four-dimensional quantum gauge theory. Witten states, "Since the asymptotic freedom of quantum non-abelian gauge theory was discovered in 1973, we have known what conjectures one should aim to prove to give a proper mathematical foundation to the standard model of particle physics."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Witten, E.|title=Physical law and the quest for mathematical understanding|journal=Bulletin of the American Mathematical Society |year=2003|volume=40|issue=01|pages=21–9|doi=10.1090/S0273-0979-02-00969-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; Is the "existence and mass gap" problem crucial for both M-theory and the finite nature hypothesis? If the problem has an affirmative solution, then the logical foundations of QFT are established on the viewpoint of infinite, continuous nature. If the problem has a negative solution in the sense that mathematical proof can show that no affirmative solution exists, then the logical foundations of QFT might require a new foundation below the [[Planck scale]]. If such a new foundation below the Planck scale consists of a finite automaton, then Fredkin and Wolfram are correct, at least in principle.

Consider two mutually-exclusive hypotheses:
# M-theory (or some other theory) might explain the Koide formula, dark energy, dark matter, and space roar with new particles and new waves and without the finite nature hypothesis. There would be BIg Bang —&gt; forever getting colder with infinite, continuous nature.
#The finite nature hypothesis might use a modification of M-theory (or some other theory) to explain the [[Koide formula]], [[dark energy]], [[dark matter]], and [[space roar]] by means of alternate universes spread across some bizarre finite automaton below the Planck scale. There would be ... —&gt; Big Bang —&gt; Big Stop to the Big Bang —&gt; Big Bang —&gt; ... with finite, digital nature and some version of the Fredkin alternate-universe engine.--&gt;

&lt;!---==Objections to the hypothesis of finite nature==
{{Weasel|date=May 2010}}

Fredkin's Finite Nature hypothesis runs counter to the accepted ideas in [[physics]] and the [[philosophy of physics]]. The vast majority of [[physicists]] reject Fredkin's [[hypothesis]] as [[pseudo-scientific]] nonsense.{{Citation needed|date=May 2010}}---&gt;

[[File:Sundial Taganrog.jpg|thumb|right|The gnomon is the [[triangular]] blade in this sundial.]]
A '''gnomon''' ([ˈnoʊmɒn], from [[Greek language|Greek]] {{lang|grc|γνώμων}}, ''gnōmōn'', literally: "one that knows or examines"&lt;ref&gt;{{LSJ|gnw/mwn|γνώμων|ref}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=gnomon|publisher=[[Online Etymology Dictionary]]|url=http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=gnomon&amp;allowed_in_frame=0}}&lt;/ref&gt;) is the part of a [[sundial]] that casts a  [[shadow]]. The term is used for a variety of purposes in mathematics and other fields.

==History==
[[File:gnomon.svg|thumb|right|A gnomon as in Euclid book II]]
A painted stick dating from 2300 BC was excavated at the astronomical site of [[Taosi]] is the oldest gnomon known in China.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |title=Gnomons in Ancient China |last=Li |first=Geng |publisher=Springer New York |year=2014 |isbn=978-1-4614-6141-8 |editor-last=Ruggles  |editor-first=Clive |publication-date=July 7, 2014 |page=2095 |script-title=Handbook of Archaeoastronomy and Ethnoastronomy}}&lt;/ref&gt; The gnomon was widely used in ancient China from the second century BC onward in order determine the changes in seasons, orientation, and geographical latitude. The ancient Chinese used shadow measurements for creating calendars that are mentioned in several ancient texts. According to the collection of Zhou Chinese poetic anthologies ''[[Classic of Poetry]]'', one of the distant ancestors of [[King Wen of Zhou|King Wen of the Zhou dynasty]] used to measure gnomon shadow lengths to determine the orientation around the 14th century BC.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|bibcode=2015hae..book.2095L|title=Handbook of Archaeoastronomy and Ethnoastronomy|first=Geng|last=Li|date=9 July 2017|publisher=|pages=2095|via=NASA ADS|doi=10.1007/978-1-4614-6141-8_219}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |title=Gnomons in Ancient China |last=Li |first=Geng |publisher=Springer New York |year=2014 |isbn=978-1-4614-6141-8 |editor-last=Ruggles  |editor-first=Clive |publication-date=July 7, 2014 |pages=2095–2096 |script-title=Handbook of Archaeoastronomy and Ethnoastronomy}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The ancient Greek philosopher [[Anaximander#Gnomon|Anaximander]] (610–546 BC) is credited with introducing this [[Babylonia]]n instrument to the Ancient Greeks.&lt;ref&gt;The 2nd-century Chinese book ''[[Nine Chapters on the Mathematical Art]]'' claims gnomons were used by the [[Duke of Zhou]] (11th century BC). [http://classicpersuasion.org/pw/diogenes/dlanaximander.htm Laertius, Diogenes. "Life of Anaximander".]&lt;/ref&gt; The ancient Greek mathematician and astronomer [[Oenopides#Geometry|Oenopides]] used the phrase ''drawn gnomon-wise'' to describe a line drawn perpendicular to another.&lt;ref name="Heath_78-79"&gt;Heath (1981) pp. 78-79&lt;/ref&gt; Later, the term was used for an '''L'''-shaped instrument like a [[steel square]] used to draw right angles. This shape may explain its use to describe a shape formed by cutting a smaller square from a larger one. [[Euclid's Elements|Euclid]] extended the term to the plane figure formed by removing a [[similarity (geometry)|similar]] [[parallelogram]] from a corner of a larger parallelogram. Indeed, the gnomon is the increment between two successive [[Figurate number#Gnomon|figurate numbers]], including square and triangular numbers. The ancient Greek mathematician and engineer [[Hero of Alexandria]] defined a gnomon as that which, when added to an entity (number or shape), makes a new entity similar to the starting entity. In this sense [[Theon of Smyrna]] used it to describe a number which added to a [[polygonal number]] produces the next one of the same type. The most common use in this sense is an odd integer especially when seen as a [[figurate number]] between [[square numbers]].

==Pinhole gnomons==
[[File:Osservazione del solstizio 21.06.12, fi, 20.JPG|thumb|The gnomon projection on the floor of the Santa Maria del Fiore Cathedral during the solstice on 21 June 2012]]
Perforated gnomons projecting a pinhole image of the sun were described in the Chinese [[Zhoubi Suanjing]] writings (1046 BCE—256 BC with material added until circa 220 AD).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite publication|url=https://books.google.nl/books?id=CyssAQAAIAAJ&amp;q=%22pierced+gnomon%22&amp;dq=%22pierced+gnomon%22&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwi87Y3Ex4fSAhXPFsAKHRNaDZEQ6AEIOzAG|title=The Asiatic Review|year=1969}}&lt;/ref&gt; The location of the bright circle can be measured to tell the time of day and year. In Arab and European cultures its invention was much later attributed to Egyptian astronomer and mathematician [[Ibn Yunus]] around 1000 AD.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.nl/books?id=msaqctAH8OkC&amp;lpg=PA6&amp;dq=%22pierced%20gnomon%22&amp;pg=PA6#v=onepage&amp;q=perforated&amp;f=false|title=Sundials: History, Theory, and Practice|last=Rohr|first=René R.J.|year=2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
Italian astronomer, mathematician and cosmographer [[Paolo Toscanelli]] is associated with the 1475 placement of a bronze plate with a round hole in the dome of the Cathedral of Santa Maria del Fiore in Florence to project an image of the sun on the cathedral's floor. With markings on the floor it tells the exact time of each midday (reportedly to within half a second) as well as the date of the summer solstice. Italian mathematician, engineer, astronomer and geographer [[Leonardo Ximenes]] reconstructed the gnomon according to his new measurements in 1756.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=Rufus|last=Suter|year=1964|title=Leonardo Ximenes and the Gnomon at the Cathedral of Florence|jstor=227759}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{further|Polar alignment}}

In the [[Northern Hemisphere]], the shadow-casting edge of a sundial gnomon is normally oriented so that it points due [[true north|northward]] and is [[Parallel (geometry)|parallel]] to the rotational axis of [[Earth]]. That is, it is [[polar alignment|inclined]] to the northern horizon at an [[angle]] that equals the [[latitude]] of the sundial's location. At present, such a gnomon should thus point almost precisely at [[Polaris]], as this is within 1° of the north [[celestial pole]].

On some sundials, the gnomon is vertical. These were usually used in former times for observing the [[altitude]] of the [[Sun]], especially when on the [[meridian (geography)|meridian]]. The style is the part of the gnomon that casts the shadow. This can change as the sun moves. For example, the upper west edge of the gnomon might be the style in the morning and the upper east edge might be the style in the afternoon. A three-dimensional gnomon is commonly used in [[computer-aided design|CAD]] and [[computer graphics]] as an aid to positioning objects in the [[virtual world]]. By convention, the ''x''-axis direction is colored red, the ''y''-axis green and the ''z''-axis blue. [[NASA]] astronauts used a gnomon as a photographic tool to indicate local vertical and to display a color chart when they were working on the Moon's surface.

==In popular culture==
*The 1985 novel ''[[Masters of Atlantis]]'' by [[Charles Portis]] is a satirical chronicle of a fictional secret society called Gnomonism.
*In the book ''The Tower at the End of the World'' by [[Brad Strickland]],  a giant [[tower]] and thin stairs turn out to be the gnomon of a giant sundial. The island the tower is found on is often called "Gnomon Island".
*The [[Gnomon of Saint-Sulpice]] inside the church of [[Saint-Sulpice (Paris)|Saint Sulpice]] in [[Paris, France]], built to assist in determining the date of [[Easter]], was fictionalized as a "[[Rose Line]]" in the novel ''[[The Da Vinci Code]]''.&lt;ref&gt;[[Sharan Newman]], ''The Real History Behind The Da Vinci Code'' (Berkley Publishing Group, 2005, p. 268).&lt;/ref&gt;

'''House numbering''' is the system of giving a unique [[number]] to each [[building]] in a [[street]] or [[Area (country subdivision)|area]], with the intention of making it easier to locate a particular building. The house number is often part of a [[Address (geography)|postal address]]. The term describes the number of any building (residential or not) with a mailbox, or even a [[land lot|vacant lot]].

House numbering schemes vary by location, and in many cases even within cities. In some areas of the world, including many remote areas, houses are named but are not assigned numbers.

== History ==
[[File:Goodman's Field.jpg|thumb|upright|One of the earliest street numbering systems was introduced along Prescott Street in Goodman's Field, London. [[John Rocque's Map of London, 1746]].]]
A house numbering scheme was present in [[Pont Notre-Dame]] in [[Paris]] in 1512.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1898/07/16/102074964.pdf |title=The Numbering of Houses |date=16 July 1898 |work=The New York Times|access-date = 27 September 2015 |publisher=Adolph Ochs}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the purpose of the numbering was generally to determine the distribution of property ownership in the city, rather than for the purpose of organization.{{Citation needed|date = September 2015}}

In the 18th century the first street numbering schemes were applied across Europe, to aid in administrative tasks and the provision of services such as [[Mail|mail delivery]]. The ''New View of [[London]]'' reported in 1708 that "at Prescott Street, Goodman's Fields, instead of signs, the houses are distinguished by numbers".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=DyZfYaLXsuUC |title=London: A Social History |author=Roy Porter |year=1998 |publisher=Harvard University Press |page=126|isbn=978-0-674-53839-9 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Parts of the Paris [[suburb]]s were numbered in the 1720s; the houses in the Jewish quarter in the city of [[Prague]] in the [[Austrian Empire]] were numbered in the same decade to aid the authorities in the [[conscription]] of the [[History of the Jews in Prague|Jews]].{{Citation needed|date = September 2015}}

Street numbering took off in the mid 18th century, especially in [[Prussia]], where authorities were ordered to "fix numbers on the houses ... in little villages on the day before the troops march in". In the 1750s and 60s, street numbering on a large scale was applied in [[Madrid]], London, Paris, and [[Vienna]], as well as many other cities across [[Europe]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://histoiremesure.revues.org/3942?lang=en |title=Addressing the Houses: The Introduction of House Numbering in Europe |accessdate=2012-12-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 1 March 1768, [[Louis XV of France|King Louis XV of France]] decreed that all French houses outside of Paris affix house numbers, primarily for tracking troops quartered in civilian homes.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |title=Indexing the great ledger of the community: urban house numbering, city directories, and the production of spatial legibility |url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0305748807000709 |journal=Journal of Historical Geography |date=1 April 2008 |pages=286–310 |volume=34 |issue=2 |doi=10.1016/j.jhg.2007.06.003 |first=Reuben S. |last=Rose-Redwood}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |title=Critical Toponymies: The Contested Politics of Place Naming |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=xg1GAepFft8C |publisher=Ashgate Publishing, Ltd. |isbn=978-0-7546-7453-5 |first=Reuben |last=Rose-Redwood |year=2009|editor-last = Berg|editor-first = Lawrence D.|editor-last2 = Vuolteenaho|editor-first2 = Jani |chapter=Indexing the Great Ledger of the Community: Urban House Numbering, City Directories, and the Production of Spatial Legibility |page=199|access-date = 26 September 2015|orig-year = originally published in 2008 in ''Journal of Historical Geography'' but revised in 2009|chapter-url = https://books.google.com/books?id=xg1GAepFft8C&amp;pg=PA199}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The number 5 means that the property is between {{convert|40|to(-)|60|m}} from the datum point of the road, and is on the left hand side of the road as viewed from the datum point.]]
In [[Australia]] and [[New Zealand]], the current standard (Australia/New Zealand joint standard AS/NZS 4819:2011 - Rural &amp; Urban Addressing)&lt;ref&gt;https://infostore.saiglobal.com/store/details.aspx?ProductID=1497944&lt;/ref&gt; is directed at local governments that have the primary responsibility for addressing and road naming. The standard calls for lots and buildings on newly created streets to be assigned odd numbers (on the left) and even numbers (on the right) when facing in the direction of increasing numbers (the European system) reflecting already common practice. It first came into force in 2003 under AS/NZS 4819:2003 - Geographic Information – Rural &amp; Urban Addressing.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.icsm.gov.au/street/&lt;/ref&gt; Exceptions are where the road forms part of the boundary between different council areas or cities. For example, Underwood Road in [[Rochedale South]], divided between [[Logan City]] and the [[City of Brisbane]].

In [[New South Wales]], the vast majority of streets were numbered before 2003, some with odd numbers assigned to houses on the right of the street when facing the direction along which numbers increase. There is no plan to reassign these numbers.

On some long urban roads (e.g. [[Parramatta Road]] in Sydney) numbers ascend until the road crosses a council or suburb boundary, then start again at 1 or 2, where a street sign gives the name of the relevant area &amp;mdash; these streets have repeating numbers. In semi-rural and rural areas, where houses and farms are widely spaced, a numbering system based on tens of metres or (less commonly) metres has been devised. Thus a farm {{convert|2300|m}} from the start of the road, on the right-hand side would be numbered 230.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.icsm.gov.au/icsm/street/index.html "Street Addressing Working Group and the National Street Addressing Standard"]. ''Intergovernmental Committee on Survey and Mapping''. March 19, 2008. Retrieved February 24, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Ballarat]] Central, Victoria uses the US system of increasing house numbers by 100 after a major cross street. Streets are designated North or South depending upon their relative position to Sturt Street.

[[File:House number of TRA Jingmei Station 20061203.jpg|180x180px|An example of the house numbering in rural area of [[Taiwan]].|thumb]]
In Japan and South Korea, a city is divided into small numbered zones. The houses within each zone are then labelled in the order in which they were constructed, or clockwise around the block. This system is comparable to the system of [[sestiere|sestieri]] (''sixths'') used in [[Venice]]. Visitors to a large, complex city like [[Tokyo]] often must resort to asking for directions at a [[Kōban|local police substation]].

In [[Hong Kong]], a former [[British colony]], the British and European norm to number houses on one side of the street with odd numbers, and the other side with even numbers, is generally followed. Some roads or streets along the coastline may however have numbering only on one side, even if the opposite side is later [[land reclamation|reclaimed]]. These roads or streets include [[Ferry Street, Hong Kong|Ferry Street]], [[Connaught Road West]], and [[Gloucester Road, Hong Kong|Gloucester Road]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hk-place.com/db.php?post=d006043]&lt;/ref&gt;

Most [[PRC|mainland Chinese]] cities use the European system, with odd numbers on one side of the road and even numbers on the opposite side. In high-density old Shanghai, a street number may be either a ''hao'' ("号" hào) or ''nong'' ("弄" nòng/lòng), both of them being numbered successively. A ''hao'' refers a door rather than a building, for example, if a building with the address 25 Wuming Rd is followed by another building, which has three entrances opening to the street, the latter will be numbered as three different ''hao'', from 27 to 29 Wuming Rd.

A ''nong'', sometimes translated as "lane", refers to a block of buildings. So if in the above example the last building is followed by an enclosed compound, it will have the address "lane 31, Wuming Rd". A ''nong'' is further subdivided in its own ''hao'', which do not correlate with the ''hao'' of the street, so the full address of an apartment within a compound may look like "Apartment 5005, no. 7, lane 31, Wuming Rd".

== Southeast Asia ==
The most common street address formats in [[Vietnam]] are:

* A number followed by the street name, for example "{{lang|vi|123 đường Lê Lợi|italic=no}}". This is the most basic, most common format.
* A number with an alphabetic suffix: "{{lang|vi|123A đường Lê Lợi|italic=no}}", "{{lang|vi|123B đường Lê Lợi|italic=no}}", etc. This format occurs when a property is numbered 123 but later subdivided into two houses with different addresses.
* If the house lies on an alley, the alley number is combined with the house number: for example, in "{{lang|vi|123/3 đường Lê Lợi|italic=no}}", 123 is the alley's address, and 3 is the house number on that alley.
* More complex house numbers may occur on alleys that branch from other alleys or properties on alleys are subdivided, for example "{{lang|vi|123/3E đường Lê Lợi|italic=no}}" or "{{lang|vi|123/3/5B đường Lê Lợi|italic=no}}". An extreme example would be "{{lang|vi|7/14/12/3/23a đường 182|italic=no}}", which is located on 3rd alley off 12th alley off 14th alley off 7th alley off 182nd street.

Another scheme is based on residential areas called {{lang|vi|cư xá}}. A {{lang|vi|cư xá}} is addressed by house number, road, and {{lang|vi|cư xá}}, for example "{{lang|vi|123 đường số 4 cư xá Bình Thới|italic=no}}". Some localities still use an older address format based on neighborhood ({{lang|vi|khu}}): for example, in "{{lang|vi|7A/34 Tô Hiến Thành|italic=no}}", 7A is the neighborhood number. This confusing format is being gradually phased out in favor of the more modern formats above.

== West Asia ==

Generally in [[Iran]] and especially in the capital [[Tehran]] odd numbers are all on one side and the even numbers opposite along streets. Infrequently, this style confuses people because this is not how it works everywhere in the city and sometimes the numbers get intertwined with each other. In the rural parts, some houses have no number at all and some have their owner's details as the number instead. In some cases, using the number 13 is skipped replacing it with equivalents such as: 12+1 or 14-1
[[File:Digital House Numbering.jpg|thumb|New digital house numbering in [[Tehran]], [[Iran]]]]

== Northern and Western Europe ==
[[File:House numbers odd and even.svg|thumb|European scheme]]
In Europe the most common house numbering scheme, in this article referred to as the "European" scheme, is to number each plot on one side of the road with ascending [[odd number]]s, from 1, and those on the other with ascending [[even number]]s, from 2 (or sometimes 0). The odd numbers are usually on the left side of the road, looking in the direction in which the numbers increase.

Where additional buildings are inserted or subdivided, these are often suffixed a, b, c, etc. (in Spain and France,  ''[[wikt:bis#Latin|bis]]'', ''[[wikt:ter#Latin|ter]]'', ''quater'').  Where buildings are later combined, they may use just one of the original numbers, combine them ("13/15"), or give their address as a range (e.g. "13–17"; not to be construed as including the even numbers 14 and 16). Buildings with multiple entrances may have a single number for the entire building or a separate number for each entrance.

Where plots are not built upon gaps may be left in the numbering scheme or marked on maps for the plots. If buildings are added to a stretch of old street the following may be used rather than a long series of suffixes to the existing numbers: a new name for a new estate/block along the street (e.g. ''1-100 Waterloo Place/Platz, Sud St.''.); a new road name inserted along the course of a street either with or without mention of the parent street; unused numbers ''above'' the highest house number may be used (although rarely as this introduces confusing discontinuity), or the upper remainder of the street is renumbered.

Other local numbering schemes are also in use for administrative or historic reasons, including clockwise and anti-clockwise numbering, district-based numbering, distance-based numbering, and double numbering.

=== Finland ===
The Finnish numbering system incorporates solutions to the problems which arose with mass [[urbanization]] and increase in building density.  Addresses always are formatted as street name followed by street address number.  With new, [[infill]] building, new addresses are created by adding letters representing the new ground level access point within the old street address, and if there are more apartments than ground level access points, a number added for the apartment number within the new development. The original street numbering system followed the pattern of odd numbers on one side and even numbers on the other side of the street, with lower numbers towards the center of town and higher numbers further away from the center.

The infill numbering system avoids renumbering the entire street when developments are modified. For example, Mannerheimintie 5 (a large mansion house on a large city plot) was demolished and replaced with 4 new buildings each with 2 stairwells all accessible from Mannerheimintie. The 8 new access stairwells are labelled A B C D E F G and H (each with the letter visible above the stairwell). Each stairwell has 4 apartments on 5 floors, so the new development has 160 new addresses in all running from Mannerheimintie 5 A 1 through to Mannerheimintie 5 H 160.  The opposite example is where old, narrow buildings have been combined; Iso Roobertinkatu 36, 38 and 40 were demolished in the 1920s and the new building has the address Iso Roobertinkatu 36-40.

In the rural parts of Finland, a variant of this method is used. As in towns, odd and even numbers are on opposite sides of the road, but many numbers are skipped. Instead, the house number indicates the distance in tens of metres from the start of the road. For example, "Pengertie 159" would be 1590 metres from the place where Pengertie starts.

=== Netherlands ===
When more buildings are constructed than numbers were originally allotted, discontinuity of numbering is avoided by giving multiple adjacent buildings the same number, with a letter suffix starting at "A". In [[Haarlem]], [[Netherlands]], red numbers are used for upstairs apartments.

=== Portugal ===
In [[Portugal]], the European scheme is most commonly used. However, in [[Porto]] and several other cities in the Portuguese [[Northern Portugal|Northern region]], as well as in the [[Cascais]] Municipality (near [[Lisbon]]), houses are numbered in the North American style, with the number assigned being proportional to the distance in [[meter]]s from the baseline of the street.

[[Lisbon]] numbering is European and furthermore 'from the river, odd numbers left'. Because the [[Tagus]] borders Lisbon on the south and the east, this means that north-south streets are numbered low from the south, and east-west streets are numbered low from the east.

In many new planned neighborhoods of Portugal houses and other buildings are identified by a ''lote'' (plot) number without reference to their street. This is in law the ''número de polícia'', which literally means ''police's number'' &amp;mdash; the police formerly assigned the numbers rather than the town hall. The ''lote'' is the construction plot number used in the [[urban plan]], a consecutive number series applies to a broad neighborhood. In theory and in most cases, the use of a ''lote'' number system is provisional, being replaced by a traditional street number system some time after the neighborhood is built and inhabited. In some neighborhoods, ''lote'' numbers are kept for many years, some never being replaced by street numbers.

The relatively new planned neighborhood of [[Parque das Nações]] in Lisbon has also a different numbering scheme: each building is referred by its plot, parcel, and building (in Portuguese: ''lote'', ''parcela'', ''prédio''&lt;ref&gt;https://www.publico.pt/2012/11/22/local/noticia/caiu-o-muro-que-dividia-o-parque-das-nacoes-1573465&lt;/ref&gt;).

=== United Kingdom ===
[[File:House numbers clockwise.jpg|thumb|Clockwise scheme. A similar, counter-clockwise scheme also remains in use in parts of Germany.]]
The European system is most widely used.  The odd numbers will typically be on the left-hand side as seen from the centre of the town or village, with the lowest numbers at the end of the street closest to the town centre. Intermediate properties usually have a number suffixed A, B, C, etc., much more rarely instead being given a half number, e.g. the old police station at {{frac|20|1|2}} Camberwell Church Street. It is extremely rare for a property (built next to no. 2 after the street had been numbered) to be zero (0) or named Minusone; researchers have found these instances once in [[Middlesbrough]] and once in [[Newbury, Berkshire|Newbury]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.mjt.me.uk/posts/falsehoods-programmers-believe-about-addresses/&lt;/ref&gt;  In many rural streets, significantly built alongside before 1900, houses remain named (unnumbered).

In some places, particularly when open land, a river or a large church fronts one side, all plots on one side of a street are numbered consecutively. Such a street if modern and long is more likely to be numbered using odd numbers, starting at 1.  Along oldest streets, numbering is usually clockwise and consecutive: for example in [[Pall Mall, London|Pall Mall]], some [[New towns in the United Kingdom|new towns]], and in many villages in [[Wales]]. This usually also applies to all [[cul de sac|culs-de-sac]]s. For instance, [[10 Downing Street]], the official home of the [[Prime Minister of the United Kingdom|Prime Minister]], is next door to [[11 Downing Street]].  Houses which surround squares are usually numbered consecutively clockwise.

In the early/mid 19th century numbering of long urban streets commonly changed (from clockwise, strict consecutive to odds (consecutive) which face evens (consecutive)). Where this took place it presents a street-long pitfall to researchers using historic [[Kelly's directory|street directories]] and other records. A very rare variation may be seen where a [[high street]] (main street) continues from a less commercial part &amp;mdash; a road which breaks the UK conventions by not starting at 1 or 2. On one side of the main road between Stratford and Leytonstone houses up to no. 122 are "Leytonstone Road". The next house is "124 High Road, Leytonstone".

Developers may avoid the number 13 for house numbering as in [[Iran]], because that number is [[Triskaidekaphobia|considered by some to be unlucky]].&lt;ref&gt;Bowlby, Chris. [http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/magazine/7779212.stm "Would you buy a number 13 house?"]. BBC News. December 12, 2008. Retrieved February 24, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

Blocks of flats (apartments) are treated in two ways:
*Flats numbered individually as part of the street. A lintel will typically be embossed or metalled "1-24 Acacia Avenue" or "Flats 1-24 Acacia Avenue".
*Flats numbered by building. The building retains its own number on the street e.g. "Flat 24, 1 Acacia Avenue" or increasingly as commonly: "Apartment 1-X, 1 Acacia Avenue" or by floor: "Apartment 9D, 1 Acacia Avenue". Outside the number of flats is discreetly shown or not revealed.

In the UK street numbering and street signposts vary across local authorities.  Numbering plates (or similar) are overwhelmingly at the discretion of house owners.

===Marking of numbers===
In the UK [[fanlight]]s in front doors were introduced in the 1720s in which the house number may be engraved.&lt;ref&gt;The Fanlight Number Company, July 19, 2009. http://www.fanlightnumbers.co.uk/history.html&lt;/ref&gt; Contemporary architecture and modern house building techniques see alternatively acrylic, aluminium, or glass, ceramic, brass, slate, or stone used.

==Southern Europe==
=== Italy ===
Italy mostly follows the European scheme described above but there are some exceptions, generally for historical reasons.

In [[Venice]], houses are numbered within six named series (one per ''[[sestiere (Venice)|sestiere]]'' district). Similarly, small villages in rural areas may also occasionally use a single progressive series for all house numbers.&lt;ref&gt;Example of house numbers in Sistiana, Italy [http://ilpiccolo.gelocal.it/trieste/cronaca/2014/01/20/news/portopiccolo-ha-gia-il-suo-indirizzo-sistiana-231-per-le-case-negozi-al-232-1.8508788 "Portopiccolo ha già il suo indirizzo: Sistiana 231 per le case, negozi al 232"]. ''Il Piccolo''. January 20, 2014. Retrieved September 23, 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Genoa]], [[Savona]] and [[Florence]] houses are marked with black (sometimes blue in Florence) numbers; businesses are usually (but not always) given red numbers, giving up to two distinct, numerically overlapping series per street. Those of businesses are denoted in all other writing (documents, online directories, etc.) by the addition of the letter "r" (e.g. "Via dei Servi 21r").

=== Turkey ===
In most of Turkey, currently the European house numbering scheme is applied. The [[Istanbul Metropolitan Municipality]] introduced new house numbering and street signs in 2007 by two official designers.&lt;ref name="Hürriyet"&gt;[http://www.hurriyet.com.tr/cumartesi/6718942.asp], Istanbul's red signs. (Turkish)&lt;/ref&gt;

== Central and Eastern Europe ==
In [[Central Europe|Central]] and [[Eastern Europe]], with some exceptions, houses are typically numbered in the European style. Many streets, however, use the "[[boustrophedon]]" system.{{explain|date=March 2017}}

=== Austria ===
A double numbering system has been used, similar to the system in the Czech Republic and Slovakia, which also were formerly parts of the [[Austro-Hungarian Empire]].

=== Czech Republic and Slovakia ===
[[File:House numbers Prague map.jpg|thumb|upright=2.5|Map of house numbering in the Prague district of Vyšehrad]]
In some [[Czech Republic|Czech]] and [[Slovakia|Slovak]] cities and settlements, two numbering systems are used concurrently.

The basic house number is the "old" or "conscription number" ([[Czech language|Czech]]: ''popisné číslo'', [[Slovak language|Slovak]]: ''súpisné číslo''). The conscription number is unique within the municipal part (a village, a quarter, mostly for one cadastral area) or within a whole small municipality.

For makeshift and recreational buildings in the Czech Republic, "registration number" (''evidenční číslo'') from a separate number series is used instead of the descriptive number. Typically, this number begins with zero or with the letter "E", or has different colour, or contains words like ''nouzová stavba'' ("makeshift structure") or ''chata'' ("weekend house"), etc.

In some settlements where streets have names (mostly in cities), "new" or "orientational numbers" (Czech: ''orientační číslo'', Slovak: ''orientačné číslo'') are also used concurrently. The orientational numbers are arranged sequentially within the street or square. If the building is on a corner or has two sides, it can have two or more orientation numbers, one for each of the adjacent streets or squares. Solitary houses distant from named streets often have no orientation number. In some places, the name of a small quarter is used instead of a street name. If there is a new building between two older numbered ones, the orientation number is distinguished with an additional lower case letter (for example, the sequence could be 5, 7, 9, 9a, 9b, 9c, 11, 13).  In the 1930–1950s in [[Brno]], lower case letters were used for separate entrances of modern block houses perpendicular to the street.

Either number may be used in addresses. Sometimes, businesses will use both numbers to avoid confusion, usually putting the descriptive (or registration) number first: "Hlavní 20/7". The two (or three) types of numbers are commonly distinguished by colour of the sign. Each municipality can have its own traditional or official rules and colours. In [[Prague]] and many other [[Bohemia]]n cities, descriptive numbers are red, orientation numbers are blue and "evidential" numbers are green or yellow or red. In many Bohemian municipalities, descriptive numbers are blue, black, or are not unified. In Brno and some Moravian and Slovak cities, descriptive numbers are white-black signs, orientation numbers are red-white signs. Many cities and municipalities have different rules.

Formerly, Roman numerals signifying the city district were added to the conscription number: e.g. "125/III" means conscription number 125 in district number III (in [[Prague]], this was [[Malá Strana]]). Roman numerals were used both in cities and in village municipalities with more settlements. Nowadays, the name of the settlement is preferred instead of Roman numerals.

The first conscription numbering was ordered by [[Maria Theresa]] in 1770 and implemented in 1770–1771. The series was given successively as the soldiers went through the settlement describing houses with numbers. Thereafter, every new house was allocated the next number sequentially, irrespective of its location. Most villages still use their original number series from 1770–1771. In cities, houses have been renumbered once or more often in order to be sequential{{spnd}}the first wave of renumbering came in 1805–1815. In 1857, the Austrian Emperor allowed a new system of numbering by streets. This new system was introduced in the biggest cities (Prague, Brno) in the 1860s. In 1884, land registration books were introduced and they used the old (conscription) numbers as a permanent and stable identifier of buildings. The new (orientation) numbers continue to be used concurrently.

=== Germany ===
In Germany, the European scheme (ascending odd/even numbers, see above) is usually used. In most cases, the numbers increase in the direction away from the town/city centre. Some places use a clockwise scheme for historical reasons, called ''Hufeisennummerierung'' ("horseshoe numbering") due to the progression of the numbers. This includes [[Berlin]], parts of [[Hamburg]] and some other towns in northern Germany.

In some older streets in northern and eastern Germany, mainly in the former [[Kingdom of Prussia]] and adjoining areas, including parts of [[Berlin]] and [[Hamburg]], the "horseshoe" numbering system (counter-clockwise "boustrophedon"-style numbering) was used for the numbering of new streets up until the 1920s, after which the European system was introduced for new streets.

Under the horseshoe numbering scheme, starting from one end, the buildings on the right side of the street were numbered sequentially from the near end to the far end of the street. The next number was then assigned to the last building on the left, opposite side of the street, the following numbers sequentially doubling back along the left side of the street.  The building with the highest number would be the first on the left side, facing building number 1 across the street. The horseshoe numbering system remains in use in older streets in many German cities, notably Berlin, although newer adjoining streets may use modern European numbering. [[Kurfürstendamm]] in Berlin is a well-known example of a street where the horseshoe numbering scheme is still in use, although the numbering today starts with 11 at [[Breitscheidplatz]], with number 237 across the street being the highest number.&lt;ref name=Wittstock&gt;{{cite book |last1=Wittstock |first1=Bernhard |title=Ziffer Zahl Ordnung. Die Berliner Hausnummer von den Anfängen Ende des 18. Jahrhunderts bis zur Gegenwart im deutschen und europäischen Kontext. |date=2011 |publisher=Berlin}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Very small villages sometimes number all buildings in the village sequentially according to their date of construction, and independent of the street they are on.  However, this scheme is being phased out because it makes it hard to find a building by its address.
&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Drochtersen hat ein Problem: Das große Durcheinander mit den Hausnummern|url=http://www.abendblatt.de/region/stade/article107538081/Das-grosse-Durcheinander-mit-den-Hausnummern.html|publisher=Hamburger Abendblatt|accessdate=13 January 2017|language=German}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Former Soviet Union ===
In [[Russia]] and many other former [[USSR]] countries, the European style is generally used, with numbers starting from the end of the street closest to the town center. Buildings or plots at street intersections may be assigned a composite number, which includes the number along the intersecting street separated by a slash ({{lang-ru|дробь}}), like in Нахимова, 14/41 (14 is the number along Nakhimova street and 41 is the number along intersecting street).

The odd numbers are usually on the left side of the road, looking in the direction in which the numbers increase; though in some cities (including [[Saint Petersburg]]) the odd numbers are on the right side. Some cities (for example, [[Nizhniy Novgorod]]) have mixed numbering: odd numbers on the right in some parts of the city and on the left in others.

Soviet era housing districts ([[microdistrict]]s) often have a complicated network of access lanes thought too small to merit their own names. Buildings in these lanes are ascribed to larger streets which may be quite far from their location; a building placed along a street may sometimes be ascribed to another street, which sometimes makes finding a building by its address a challenging task.

In some cities, especially hosting large scientific or military research centers in Soviet time, the numbering might be different: houses may have numbers related to the block rather than the street, thus 12-й квартал, дом 3 (Block 12, House 3),&lt;ref name=dxdy&gt;[http://dxdy.ru/topic3547.html Related discussion], additional text.&lt;/ref&gt; similar to the Japanese and Korean systems (see below). [[Aktau]] is one example of this.

When a numbered plot contains multiple buildings, they are assigned an additional component of the street address, called корпус (building), which is usually a sequentially assigned number unique within the plot (but sometimes contains letters as in 15а, 15б, 15в and so on). So, a Russian street address may look like Московское шоссе, дом 23, корпус 2 (Moscow Street, plot 23, building 2), or Льва Толстого, дом 14б (Leo Tolstoy Street, plot 14, building b).

On very long roads in suburban areas, a kilometer numbering system also may be used (like Australian rural numbering system). For example, 9-й км Воткинского шоссе (9th kilometer of Votkinsk Highway), and Шабердинский тракт, 7-й км (7th kilometer of Shaberdy Road).

&lt;/gallery&gt;

== Latin America ==
[[File:House numbers meters.jpg|thumb|Distance scheme]]
In Latin America, some countries, like Mexico and Uruguay, use systems similar to those in Europe. Houses are numbered in ascending order from downtown to the border of the city. In Mexico, the cities are usually divided in ''Colonias'', which are small or medium areas. The ''colonia'' is commonly included in the address before the postal code. Sometimes when houses merge in a street or new constructions are built after the numbering was made, the address can become ambiguous. When a number is re-used, a letter is added for the newer address. For example, if there are two 35s, one remains as "35", and the second one becomes "35A" or "35[[wikt:Bis#Latin|Bis]]".

It is sometimes common in remote towns or non-planned areas inside the cities, that the streets do not have any name and the houses do not have numbers. In these cases, the address of the houses are usually the name of a person or family, the name of the area or town, or ''Dirección Conocida'' ("known address"), which means that the house of the family is known by almost all the community. This kind of addressing is only used in remote towns or small communities near highways. For people living near highways or roads, the usual address is the kilometer distance of the road in which the house is established; if there is more than one address, some references might be written or the ''Dirección Conocida'' may be added.

In Uruguay, most house numbering starts at a high number among the hundreds or the thousands. The system is similar to the French-Spanish one: when a house is divided the term 'bis' is added with the difference that no single term designates the third: when a house is divided or added between another the term 'bis' is repeated as many divisions have been made or houses added in between, for example '3217 bis bis' corresponds to the third house from the 3217th, and so on, when many houses are merged the lowest number is used, leaving the in-between numbers missing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Caravia|first1=Antonio|title=Colección de leyes, decretos y resoluciones gubernativas, tratados tratados internacionales, acuerdos del Tribunal de apelaciones y disposiciones de carácter permanente de la República Oriental del Uruguay|date=1867|publisher=Imp. a vapor de LA TRIBUNA|location=Montevideo|page=278|edition=HARVARD COLLEGE LIBRARY DEC 24 1915 LATIN AMERICAN PROFESSORSHIP FUND.|url=https://books.google.com.uy/books?id=pwIDAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA278&amp;dq=numeracion+de+puerta+montevideo&amp;hl=es-419&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjt6d6co__SAhXCg5AKHWWnD0EQ6AEIHzAB|accessdate=30 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Also there are cases when no number is assigned, this occurs mostly in peripheral areas inside the cities, low house numbering occurs in small locations and in balneary areas houses are designated by name rather than number.

In countries like [[Brazil]] and [[Argentina]], a scheme is used also for streets in cities, where the house number is the distance measured in meters from the house to the start of the street. In [[Venezuela]], houses, buildings,  and streets have names instead of numbers.

[[File:Hamilton County Street Address map.png|thumb|House numbers in [[Hamilton County, Ohio]], have a clear spatial pattern; lower in Downtown [[Cincinnati]] and progressively higher further out in the suburbs]]

In the United States and Canada, streets are usually numbered with odd on one side and even on the other.  The specific ordering of the numbers vary based on the policies of the local municipality.  Generally, three different systems exist:

*Streets may be numbered strictly sequentially, starting with 1 at the start of the street, and continuing in order skipping no numbers until the end.  In these cases, if additional addresses are needed to be assigned to new buildings, fractional house numbers may be used, or letter suffixes may be appended to the house number.

*Streets may be numbered from the most recent intersection.  In these cases, numbers progress sequentially from each intersection, but skip to the next set of numbers at each cross street, usually in sets of even 100s.  Thus, the first [[city block|block]] on a street may start at 1, and continue up until the next block, when they start at 101, then 201, and so on.

*Streets may be numbered based on distances, where the house number is based on some mathematical formula according to the distance from the start of the numbering system.

Even within these systems, there is are also two ways to define the starting point for the numbering system.  Some places will start the numbering system at the start of the street itself.  Other places will define a numbering system based on a defined point or line, such as a municipal or county boundary, or a defined intersection near the center of the municipality, with numbers increasing generally as one gets further from the baseline, regardless of where streets start or stop.

'''ICRA, the International Center for Relativistic Astrophysics''' is an international research institute for relativistic astrophysics and related areas. Its members are seven Universities and four organizations. The center is located in Rome, Italy.

The International Center for Relativistic Astrophysics (ICRA) was founded in 1985 by [[Remo Ruffini]] ([[Sapienza University of Rome|University of Rome "La Sapienza"]]) together with [[Riccardo Giacconi]] ([[Nobel Prize]] for Physics 2002), [[Abdus Salam]] (Nobel Prize for Physics 1979), Paul Boynton ([[University of Washington]]), [[George Coyne]] (former director of the [[Vatican Observatory|Vatican observatory]]), [[Francis Everitt]] ([[Stanford University]]), [[Fang Lizhi|Fang Li-Zhi]] ([[University of Science and Technology of China]]). It became a legal entity in 1991 with the Ministerial Decree 22/11/1991 from the Ministry of Education, Universities and Research.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.gazzettaufficiale.it/atto/serie_generale/caricaDettaglioAtto/originario;jsessionid=-VZ1tD6Z2fXF3PMUAI5TAw__.ntc-as4-guri2b?atto.dataPubblicazioneGazzetta=1992-08-31&amp;atto.codiceRedazionale=092A4013&amp;elenco30giorni=false|title=Gazzetta Ufficiale della Repubblica Italiana n. 204 del 31/8/1992|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The International Center of Relativistic Astrophysics is located in the Department of Physics building at the main Campus of the University of Rome "Sapienza".

In 2005 ICRA has been among the founders of [[ICRANet]], the International Center for Relativistic Astrophysics Network. The national activities of research and teaching in Italy remained operative at ICRA in Rome, while international activities and coordination are now based in ICRANet in Pescara.

==Other activities==

===Meetings initiated by ICRA===
'''Marcel Grossmann meetings'''

Writing down the equations of General Relativity was no doubt the result of Einstein's brilliant physical intuition, based from the mathematical point of view on the work of Gregorio Ricci Curbastro and Tullio Levi Civita of the University of Padua and the University of Rome "La Sapienza". Essential to this work was the intervention of Marcel Grossmann of the University of Zurich who was close to Einstein and who had a deep knowledge of the Italian school of geometry.
In order to promote this important collaboration between physics and mathematics, in celebration of that historic event, Remo Ruffini and Abdus Salam established in 1975 the Marcel Grossmann meetings (MG) on Recent Developments in Theoretical and Experimental General Relativity, Gravitation, and Relativistic Field Theories which take place every three years in different countries. MG1 and MG2 were held in 1975 and in 1979 in Trieste; MG3 in 1982 in Shanghai; MG4 in 1985 in Rome; MG5 in 1988 in Perth; MG6 in 1991 in Kyoto; MG7 in 1994 at Stanford; MG8 in 1997 in Jerusalem; MG9 in 2000 in Rome; MG10 in 2003 in Rio de Janeiro; MG11 in 2006 in Berlin; MG12 in 2009 in Paris; MG13 in 2012 in Stockholm; MG14 in 2015 in Rome.

'''Italian-Korean Meetings on Relativistic Astrophysics'''

The Italian-Korean Symposia on Relativistic Astrophysics is a series of biannual meetings organized alternatively in Italy and in Korea since 1987. It has been boosting exchange of information and collaborations between Italian and Korean astrophysicists on new and hot issues in the field of Relativistic Astrophysics. The symposia cover topics in astrophysics and cosmology, such as gamma ray bursts and compact stars, high energy cosmic rays, dark energy and dark matter, general relativity, black holes, and new physics related to cosmology.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://icranet.org/images/stories/Meetings/IK13/Korea.pdf|title=Italian-Korean Meetings|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''William Fairbank Meetings on Relativistic Gravitational Experiments in Space'''

The First William Fairbank Meeting on was held at the University of Rome "La Sapienza," in 1990, under the auspices of ICRA with support from ASI (Italian Space Agency), ESA (European Space Agency), the Vatican Observatory, Stanford University and the University of Rome. Almost 80 physicists and engineers in widely diversified fields relativistic gravitation, space research, SQUID technology, large scale cryogenics, clock technology, laser and radar science and other fields - came together in the kinds of free technical exchange so characteristic of William Fairbank, in whose honor the meeting was held. The second meeting was held in Hong Kong and was devoted to relativistic gravitational experiments in space. The third meeting held in Rome and Pescara in 1998 was focused on the Lense-Thirring effect.

The [https://ischp.info/ '''International Society of Critical Health Psychology''' ('''ISCHP''')] is a society devoted to debate about [[critical psychology|critical ideas]] within [[health psychology]] and developing new ways of [[health psychology]] practice. ISCHP's members commonly make use of [[qualitative research|qualitative methods]] and [[participatory action research|participatory research methods]] to address social, political and cultural issues within [[health psychology]].

The venue for the 2019 ISCHP conference will be [[Bratislava]] in Slovakia from the evening of Sunday 14th July 2019 to late afternoon on Wednesday 17th July. More details will be posted on the [http://ischp2019.sk/ conference website].

[[File:Bradford sun ISCHP 2013.png|thumb|right|Late afternoon sun over [[Bradford]] during ISCHP 2013 ]]

==History==
In July 1999, the First International Conference on Critical and Qualitative Approaches to Health Psychology was held in St. John's, Newfoundland, Canada, organised by [http://www.keele.ac.uk/psychology/people/michaelmurray/ Michael Murray].  Over 120 [[health psychology|critical health psychologists]] from 20 countries and every continent on the globe attended the conference.  It was agreed that there was an urgent need to establish a network to begin to connect those [[health psychology|health psychologists]] throughout the world who were interested in developing a more critical approach to the subject.

In August 2001, the Second International Conference was held in Birmingham, UK.  The International Society of Critical Health Psychology was established at this conference. The founding committee members include (alphabetically) [[Kerry Chamberlain]], Sue Dalton, [[Antonia Lyons]], [[David Marks (psychologist)|David Marks]], [http://www.keele.ac.uk/psychology/people/michaelmurray/ Michael Murray], Alan Radley, [http://hsc-people.open.ac.uk/w.stainton-rogers Wendy Stainton Rogers] and [http://www.massey.ac.nz/massey/expertise/profile.cfm?stref=743230 Chris Stephens]. Currently, the Chair is [http://www.otago.ac.nz/psychology/staff/garethtreharne.html Gareth Treharne], the Vice-Chair is [http://www.uel.ac.uk/psychology/staff/poulrohleder/ Poul Rohleder], the Treasurer is [http://www.massey.ac.nz/massey/expertise/profile.cfm?stref=743230 Chris Stephens], the Secretary is [http://www.bradford.ac.uk/social-sciences/staff-profiles/psychology/abigail-locke.php Abigail Locke].

==Aims==
ISCHP has the following aims:
* Encourage, enable and disseminate research and scholarship in critical health psychology and provide opportunities for debate and discussion in this field.
* Provide a forum for scrutinising, challenging and questioning what is said and done in the purported pursuit of promoting and improving "health" by health psychologists and others.
* Operate as a community of scholars (in the widest definition of that term and absolutely not restricted to people with formal affiliations to a university or other academic body), offering each other mutual support in the pursuit of critical approaches to health.
* In particular, nurture and help early-career, young and emerging scholars in the field, and engage with and learn from communities and groups conventionally excluded or under-represented.

Members of the Society take a variety of theoretical and methodological viewpoints.  However, as with other [[critical psychology|critical psychologists]], they share a common dissatisfaction with the [[positivist]] assumptions of much of mainstream psychology and its ignorance of broader social and political issues.  Instead, they share an interest in various critical ideas (e.g. [[social constructionism]], [[post-modernism]], [[feminism]], [[marxism]], etc.) and various [[qualitative research|qualitative]] and [[participatory action research|participatory methods of research]] (e.g. [[discourse analysis]], [[grounded theory]], [[action research]], [[ethnography]], etc.) and their relevance to understanding health and illness.  Further, they share an awareness of the social, political and cultural dimensions of health and illness (e.g. [[poverty]], [[racism]], [[sexism]], [[political]] [[oppression]], etc.) and an active commitment to reducing human suffering and promoting improved quality of life, especially among those sections of society most in need.

==Membership==
ISCHP welcomes membership from anyone who is aligned with its aims, regardless of disciplinary affiliation.  ISCHP has members throughout the world, who are mostly critical health psychology researchers, but members also come from other fields of psychology, as well as from the sociology and anthropology of health, illness and medicine, health sciences, nursing, media studies, communication studies, cultural studies and other disciplines.  As of 2015 the society has approximately 850 members in over 36 countries. Details on how to join ISCHP and thus receive the email updates can be found on [https://ischp.info/join-us/ ISCHP's website.]

==Blog, Facebook page, and Twitter profile==
ISCHP has a [https://ischp.info/ blog] to keep members up to date on current issues in critical health psychology and activities of the Society. ISCHP also has an [http://www.facebook.com/ISCHPsychology official Facebook page] and an [https://twitter.com/crithealthpsych official Twitter profile], on which topical updates are posted about events, jobs and studies.

==Conferences==
The Society organizes a biennial conference.  These conferences have been held in: [[St. John's, Newfoundland and Labrador|St. John's]], Newfoundland, Canada (1999); [[Birmingham, UK]] (2001); [[Auckland]], New Zealand (2003); [[Sheffield]], UK (2005); [[Boston]], USA (2007); [[Lausanne]], Switzerland (2009); [[Adelaide]], Australia (2011); [[Bradford]], UK (2013); [[Grahamstown]], South Africa (2015); and most recently in [[Loughborough]], UK (2017).

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10221">The '''law of effect''' is a [[psychology|psychological]] principle advanced by [[Edward Thorndike]] in 1898 on the matter of [[behaviorism|behavioral conditioning]] (not then formulated as such) which states that "responses that produce a satisfying effect in a particular situation become more likely to occur again in that situation, and responses that produce a discomforting effect become less likely to occur again in that
situation."&lt;ref name=gray/&gt;

This notion is very similar to that of the evolutionary theory, if a certain character trait provides an advantage for reproduction then that trait will persist.&lt;ref&gt; Schacter, Gilbert, Wegner. (2011). "''Psychology Second Edition''" New York: Worth Publishers.&lt;/ref&gt; The terms "satisfying" and dissatisfying" appearing in the definition of the law of effect were eventually replaced by the terms "reinforcing" and "punishing," when operant conditioning became known. "Satisfying" and "dissatisfying" conditions are determined behaviorally, and they cannot be accurately predicted, because each animal has a different idea of these two terms than another animal. The new terms, "reinforcing" and "punishing" are used differently in psychology than they are colloquially. Something that reinforces a behavior makes it more likely that that behavior will occur again, and something that punishes a behavior makes it less likely that behavior will occur again.&lt;ref&gt;Mazur, J.E. (2013) "Basic Principles of Operant Conditioning." Learning and Behavior. (7th ed., pp. 101–126). Pearson.&lt;/ref&gt;

Thorndike's law of effect refutes the ideas [[George Romanes]]' book ''Animal Intelligence'', stating that anecdotal evidence is weak and is typically not useful. The book stated that animals, like humans, think things through when dealing with a new environment or situation. Instead, Thorndike hypothesized that animals, to understand their physical environment, must physically interact with it using trial and error, until a successful result is obtained. This is illustrated in his cat experiment, in which a cat is placed in a shuttlebox and eventually learns, by interacting with the environment of the box, how to escape.&lt;ref&gt;Mazur, J.E. (2013) "Basic Principles of Operant Conditioning." Learning and Behavior. (7th ed., pp. 101-126). Pearson.&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
This principle, discussed early on by [[C. Lloyd Morgan|Lloyd Morgan]], is usually associated with the [[connectionism]] of [[Edward Thorndike]], who said that if an association is followed by a "satisfying state of affairs" it will be strengthened and if it is followed by an "annoying state of affairs" it will be weakened.&lt;ref&gt; Thorndike, E. L. (1898, 1911) "Animal Intelligence: an Experimental Study of the Associative Processes in Animals" Psychological Monographs #8 &lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt; A. Charles Catania. "Thorndike's Legency: Learning Selection, and the law of effect", p. 425–426. University of Mary Land Baltimore&lt;/ref&gt;

The modern version of the law of effect is conveyed by the notion of [[reinforcement]] as it is found in [[operant conditioning]]. The essential idea is that behavior can be modified by its consequences, as Thorndike found in his famous experiments with hungry cats in puzzle boxes. The cat was placed in a box that could be opened if the cat pressed a lever or pulled a loop. Thorndike noted the amount of time it took the cat to free itself on successive trials in the box. He discovered that during the first few trials the cat would respond in many ineffective ways, such as scratching at the door or the ceiling, finally freeing itself with the press or pull by trial-and-error. With each successive trial, it took the cat, on average, less and less time to escape. Thus, in modern terminology, the correct response was reinforced by its consequence, release from the box.&lt;ref&gt;[http://icebreakerideas.com/learning-theories/#Connectionism_E_Thorndike ''Connectionism'']. Thorndike, Edward.Q Retrieved Dec 10, 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

== Definition ==
[[File:Lawofeffect.gif|thumb|Initially, the cat's responses were largely instinctual, but over time, the pressing lever response was strengthened while the others were weakened]]

Law of effect is the belief that a pleasing after-effect strengthens the action that produced it.&lt;ref&gt;Boring, Edwin`. Science. 1. 77. New York: American Association for the Advancement of Science, 2005. 307. Web. &lt;/ref&gt;

The law of effect was published by Edward Thorndike in 1905 and states that when an S-R association is established in instrumental conditioning between the instrumental response and the contextual stimuli that are present, the response is reinforced and the S-R association holds the sole responsibility for the occurrence of that behavior.  Simply put, this means that once the stimulus and response are associated, the response is likely to occur without the stimulus being present.
It holds that [[Stimulus (psychology)|responses]] that produce a satisfying or pleasant state of affairs in a particular situation are more likely to occur again in a similar situation. Conversely, responses that produce a discomforting, annoying or unpleasant effect are less likely to occur again in the situation.

Psychologists have been interested in the factors that are important in behavior change and control since psychology emerged as a discipline. One of the first principles associated with learning and behavior was the Law of Effect, which states that behaviors that lead to satisfying outcomes are likely to be repeated, whereas behaviors that lead to undesired outcomes are less likely to recur.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.enotes.com/gale-psychology-encyclopedia/law-effect |title=Law of Effect |publisher=eNotes.com |date= |accessdate=2012-08-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Puzzle box.jpg|thumb|Thorndike's Puzzle-Box. The graph demonstrates the general decreasing trend of the cat's response times with each successive trial]]

Thorndike emphasized the importance of the situation in eliciting a response; the cat would not go about making the lever-pressing movement if it was not in the puzzle box but was merely in a place where the response had never been reinforced. The situation involves not just the cat's location but also the stimuli it is exposed to, for example, the hunger and the desire for freedom. The cat recognizes the inside of the box, the bars, and the lever and remembers what it needs to do to produce the correct response. This shows that learning and the law of effect are context-specific.

In an influential paper, [[Richard Herrnstein|R. J. Herrnstein]] (1970)&lt;ref&gt;Herrnstein, R. J. (1970). On the law of effect. ''Journal of the Experimental Analysis of Behavior, 13'', 243-266.&lt;/ref&gt; proposed a quantitative relationship between response rate (''B'') and reinforcement rate (''Rf''):
&lt;center&gt;
''B'' = ''k'' ''Rf'' / (''Rf''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; + ''Rf'')
&lt;/center&gt;
where ''k'' and ''Rf''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; are constants. Herrnstein proposed that this formula, which he derived from the [[matching law]] he had observed in studies of [[concurrent schedules of reinforcement]], should be regarded as a quantification of the law of effect. While the qualitative law of effect may be a tautology, this quantitative version is not.

=== Example ===
An example is often portrayed in drug addiction. When a person uses a substance for the first time and receives a positive outcome, they are likely to repeat the behavior due to the reinforcing consequence. Over time, the person's nervous system will also develop a tolerance to the drug. Thus only by increasing dosage of the drug will provide the same satisfaction, making it dangerous for the user.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Neil|first=Carlson|title=Psychology The Science Of Behaviour|year=2007|publisher=Pearson Education Canada, Inc.,|location=New Jersey, USA|page=516|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Thorndike's Law of Effect can be compared to Darwin's theory of [[natural selection]] in which successful organisms are more likely to prosper and survive to pass on their genes to the next generation, while the weaker, unsuccessful organisms are gradually replaced and "stamped out". It can be said that the environment selects the "fittest" behavior for a situation, stamping out any unsuccessful behaviors, in the same way it selects the "fittest" individuals of a species. In an experiment that Thorndike conducted, he placed a hungry cat inside a "puzzle box", where the animal could only escape and reach the food once it could operate the latch of the door. At first the cats would scratch and claw in order to find a way out, then by chance / accident, the cat would activate the latch to open the door. On successive trials, the behaviour of the animal would become more habitual, to a point where the animal would operate without hesitation. The occurrence of the favourable outcome, reaching the food source, only strengthens the response that it produces.

Colwill and Rescorla for example made all rats complete the goal of getting food pellets and liquid sucrose in consistent sessions on identical variable-interval schedules.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last=Nevin |first=John|title="Analyzing Thorndike's Law of Effect: The Question of Stimulus - Response Bonds"|year=1999|publisher=Journal of the Experiment Analysis of Behaviour|page=448}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Influence ==
The law of  work for psychologist [[B. F. Skinner]] almost half a century later on the principles of operant conditioning, "a learning process by which the effect, or consequence, of a response influences the future rate of production of that response."&lt;ref name=gray&gt;Gray, Peter. ''Psychology'', Worth, NY. 6th ed. pp 108–109&lt;/ref&gt; Skinner would later use an updated version of Thorndike's puzzle box, called the operant chamber, or Skinner box, which has contributed immensely to our perception and understanding of the law of effect in modern society and how it relates to operant conditioning. It has allowed a researcher to study the behavior of small organisms in a controlled environment.

He is best known for his service in the [[Imperial Trans-Antarctic Expedition]] of 1914–1916, for which he was awarded the Silver [[Polar Medal]].&lt;ref name="Obituary"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.enduranceobituaries.co.uk/mccarthy.htm |title=The Endurance Obituaries: Lewis Raphael Rickinson |author=John F.

==Biography==
Rickinson was born on 21 April 1883 in [[Lewisham]], which was then part of the [[County of Kent]] but has since become part of [[Greater London]].  His father was Charles Napier Rickinson and his mother was Emma Isaac Rickinson.  As a man trained for work with marine engines, he signed on the ''Endurance'' as the chief engineer.  Although the ''[[Endurance (1912 ship)|Endurance]]'' was rigged as a [[barquentine]], it also had a coal-burning engine and spent much of its time under steam.&lt;ref name="Obituary"/&gt;  

Under the expedition plans and the articles that Rickinson had signed, his job was to work the engines during the Antarctic summer of 1914-1915 to get the ''Endurance'' to the [[Filchner Ice Shelf]].  Once the vessel had reached her destination, she and her crew were supposed to unload the expedition leader, Sir [[Ernest Shackleton]], and a shore party for expedition work in the interior of [[Antarctica]].  Rickinson and the ship's company were then supposed to steam north toward warmer waters to avoid the worst of the [[Polar night|Antarctic winter]] of 1915.  However, when the ''Endurance'' was beset by pack ice in the [[Weddell Sea]], these plans could not be implemented.  With all of the other members of the expedition, Rickinson was first forced to spend the winter in the depths of the southern Weddell Sea, and then shared the fate of his fellow explorers as castaways when the mother ship was crushed and sunk by the ice.  After camping on the [[Drift ice|melting ice]] for some months, the ship's company and shore party were forced to take to [[lifeboat (shipboard)|lifeboat]]s.  Rickinson was assigned to the lifeboat ''Stancomb Wills''.&lt;ref name="Obituary"/&gt;

Shackleton was impressed by Rickinson's ability to take on his share of the survival duties of the party.  Unfortunately in April 1916, when the lifeboat party was making a hazardous landing on the shore of [[Elephant Island]] off the coast of the [[Antarctic Peninsula]], young Rickinson was stricken while wading ashore in the surf.  Once all were safely on shore, the expedition doctor diagnosed the 32-year-old engineer with a mild [[myocardial infarction|heart attack]].  He was advised to rest as much as possible in a crude lean-to hut, the ''Snuggery'', built by the men.  Meanwhile Shackleton and a picked crew of volunteers had separated from the main party to mount a forlorn open-boat attempt to escape from Antarctica and fetch help for the Elephant Island castaways, including Rickinson.  After enduring more than four months of near-starvation rations Rickinson, who was still classified as an invalid, was rescued from Elephant Island with his comrades.  His time in the Antarctic was over; it was 30 August 1916.&lt;ref name="Obituary"/&gt;

Upon returning to Britain Rickinson found [[World War I]] being fought.  Despite his cardiac diagnosis he joined the colours, was passed as fit, and served in the Royal Navy.  In 1918 he married Marjorie Kate Snell.  Two children, son Lewis F. Rickinson (1919) and daughter Betty Rickinson (1923), were born of this union.  With the coming of peace Rickinson chose life on shore.  He became a consulting engineer, specializing in the shipbuilding design and installation of marine power units.&lt;ref name="Obituary"/&gt;    

With the coming of [[World War II]], Rickinson rejoined the colours and was assigned to ''[[Drill Hall Library|HMS Pembroke]]'', the pseudo-floating naval barracks and training establishment at [[Chatham, Kent|Chatham]] in the [[Medway]].  He rose to the rank of engineer [[Commander (Royal Navy)|naval commander]] and served until his diagnosis with [[lung cancer]].  He was seconded to a Berkshire nursing home for [[hospice]] care, and died there in April 1945, age 61.&lt;ref name="Obituary"/&gt;

==Legacy==
In 1916–17, Rickinson was awarded the [[Polar Medal]] in silver.&lt;ref name="Obituary"/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5022">A '''light stage''' or '''light cage''' is equipment used for [[3D modeling|shape]], [[texture mapping|texture]], reflectance and [[motion capture]] often with [[structured light]] and a [[multi-camera setup]].

== Reflectance capture ==
The [[reflectance field]] over a [[human face]] was first captured in 2000 by [[Paul Debevec]] et al. The method they used to find the [[subsurface scattering|light that travels under the skin]] was based on the existing [[scientific knowledge]] that light reflecting off the air-to-oil retains its [[Polarization (waves)|polarization]] while light that travels under the skin loses its polarization.&lt;ref name="Deb2000"/&gt;

[[Image:BSDF05 800.png|thumb|right|240px|[[Bidirectional scattering distribution function]]: BRDF + BTDF]]''

Using this information, a light stage was built by Debevec et al., consisting of
# Moveable [[digital camera]]
# Moveable simple [[light source]] (full [[rotation]] with adjustable [[radius]] and height)
# Two [[polarizer]]s set into various [[angle]]s in front of the light and the camera
# A computer with relatively simple programs doing relatively simple tasks.&lt;ref name="Deb2000"&gt;{{cite web

&lt;/ref&gt; The setup enabled the team to find the [[subsurface scattering]] component of the [[bidirectional scattering distribution function]] over the human face which was required for [[virtual cinematography|fully virtual cinematography]] with ultra-photorealistic digital look-alikes, similar to effects seen in the films ''[[The Matrix Reloaded]]'', ''[[The Matrix Revolutions]]'' and others since the early 2000s.

Following great scientific success Debevec et al. constructed more elaborate versions of the light stage at the [[University of Southern California]]'s (USC)'s [[Institute for Creative Technologies]] (ICT).  Ghosh et al. built the seventh version of the USC light stage X. In 2014 President [[Barack Obama]] had his image and reflectance captured with the USC mobile light stage.&lt;ref name="USC2014"&gt;

== Examples of use ==
* [[Human image synthesis]] is hard to tell apart from a human imaged with an [[imaging technology|imaging]] technology
** '''Digital Emily''' presented to the [[SIGGRAPH]] convention in 2008 was a project whereby the reflection field of [[actress]] [[Emily O'Brien]] was captured using the USC light stage 5,&lt;ref name="TED2009"&gt;[http://www.ted.com/talks/paul_debevec_animates_a_photo_real_digital_face.html Paul Debevec animates a photo-real digital face - Digital Emily] 2008&lt;/ref&gt; and the prerendered digital look-alike was made in association with [[Image Metrics]]. Video came from USC light stage 5 and USC light stage 6.
** '''Digital Ira''' was a fairly convincingly [[Rendering (computer graphics)|rendered]] [[real-time computer graphics|real-time]] image that was presented at the 2013 SIGGRAPH in association with [[Activision]].&lt;ref name="Deb2013"&gt;{{cite web

This article is a '''list of countries by median age'''. 

== Methodology ==
Median age is the age that divides a population into two numerically equal groups - that is, half the people are younger than this age and half are older. It is a single index that summarizes the age distribution of a population.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/fields/2177.html Field Listing - Median age], [[The World Factbook]], [[Central Intelligence Agency]]. Data last updated on April 2, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

Currently, the median age ranges from a low of about 15 in [[Demographics of Niger|Niger]] to 40 or more in several [[Europe]]an countries, [[Demographics of Canada|Canada]] and [[Demographics of Japan|Japan]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/docs/notesanddefs.html#2177]&lt;/ref&gt; The median age for women tends to be much greater than that of men in some of the [[ex-Soviet republics]], while in the [[Global South]] the difference is far smaller or is reversed.

===Optics===
Mirrors and lenses are the critical light-bending components of a telescope.
*[[Objective (optics)|Objective]]: The first lens or curved mirror that collects and focuses the incoming light.
**Primary lens: The objective of a [[Refractor telescope|refracting telescope]].
**[[Primary mirror]]: The objective of a [[reflecting telescope]].
*Corrector plate: A full aperture negative lens placed before a primary mirror designed to correct the optical aberrations of the mirror.  
**[[Schmidt corrector plate]]: An aspheric-shaped corrector plate used in the Schmidt telescope.
**[[Meniscus corrector]]: A meniscus-shaped corrector plate usually used in the Maksutov telescope.
*Focusing mask: A full aperture mask temporarily placed before the primary mirror to aid in focusing the telescope.
**[[Bahtinov mask]]
**[[Carey mask]]
**[[Hartmann mask]]
*[[Catadioptric system#Sub-aperture correctors|Sub-aperture corrector]]: One or a series of corrective lens (sometimes combined with a corrective curved mirror) placed after (near the focus) a primary mirror designed to correct the optical aberrations of the mirror. These can be just a small version of the corrector plate, but since they are usually used in a [[Cassegrain reflector|Cassegrain]] configuration in front of the secondary mirror they require additional modification since the light passes through them twice.  
*[[Secondary mirror]]
*[[Mirror#Instruments]]
*[[Curved mirror]]
*[[Honeycomb mirror]]
*[[Liquid mirror telescopes|Liquid mirror]]
*[[Parabolic reflector]]
Subsequent (sometimes optional) components realign, segment, or in some way modify the light of an incoming image:
*[[Field lens]]: A correcting lens placed just before the [[image plane]] of a telescope.{{Citation needed|date=January 2012}}
*[[Telecompressor]] or focal reducer: Optical element to decrease the telescope's focal length and magnification (usually by a fixed percentage) and widen the field of view, providing opposite effects of a [[Barlow lens]].
*[[Star Diagonal]]: Used to change the angle of the light coming out of a telescope, for easier viewing.
*[[Herschel Wedge]]: Similar to a star diagonal with a wedge-shaped unsilvered prism reflector that reduces incoming light by up to 95% for solar viewing.
*[[Coma corrector]] a correcting lens used to reduce coma distortion in fast reflecting telescopes.
*[[Field flattener]] a correcting lens used to reduce field curvature in refracting telescopes for [[atrophotography]].
*[[Barlow lens]]: Optical element to increase the telescope's focal length and magnification, narrow the field of view and reduce [[coma]] distortion, providing opposite effects of a [[telecompressor]].
*[[Astronomical filter]]: Used to select specific colors (or light frequencies) for astrophotography.
*[[Filter wheel]]: One manner to easily insert filters into the optical train.  Mostly used for photography.
*[[Dual speed focuser|Focuser]]: Allows the user to adjust the focus by moving the eyepiece along the optical axis.
*[[Eyepiece]]: Performs the final focus correction before the light reaches the eye.
*[[Charge-coupled device#Use in astronomy|Charge-coupled device (CCD)]]: A light-sensitive integrated circuit digital sensor (commonly used in digital cameras) that turns light into an electrical charge used to collection image data.

Generally applicable to all items:
*[[Metallizing]]: A way of coating mirrors for high-efficiency light reflection.
*[[Optical coating]]: Thin layers applied to mirrors, filters, and lenses to avoid reflections, as well as absorb certain colors.

There are many longstanding [[unsolved problems in mathematics]] for which a solution has still not yet been found. The '''unsolved problems in [[statistics]]''' are generally of a different flavor; according to John Tukey,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last = Tukey | first = John W. |title = Unsolved Problems of Experimental Statistics|journal= Journal of the American Statistical Association|volume= 49|issue= 268|year= 1954|pages= 706–731 |doi = 10.2307/2281535|publisher = Journal of the American Statistical Association, Vol. 49, No. 268|jstor = 2281535}}
&lt;/ref&gt; "difficulties in identifying problems have delayed statistics far more than difficulties in solving problems." A list of "one or two open problems" (in fact 22 of them) was given by [[David Cox (statistician)|David Cox]].&lt;ref&gt;Cox, D.R. (1984) "Present position and potential developments: Some personal views &amp;mdash; Design of experiments and regression", ''[[Journal of the Royal Statistical Society, Series A]]'', 147 (2), 306&amp;ndash;315&lt;/ref&gt;

==Inference and testing==
* How to detect and correct for '''[[systematic error]]s''', especially in sciences where [[random error]]s are large (a situation Tukey termed [[uncomfortable science]]).
* The [[Graybill–Deal estimator]] is often used to estimate the common mean of two normal populations with unknown and possibly unequal variances. Though this estimator is generally unbiased, its [[admissible decision rule|admissibility]] remains to be shown.&lt;ref&gt;Nabendu Pal, Wooi K. Lim (1997) "A note on second-order admissibility of the Graybill–Deal estimator of a common mean of several normal populations", ''Journal of Statistical Planning and Inference'', 63 (1), 71&amp;ndash;78. {{doi|10.1016/S0378-3758(96)00202-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
* '''[[Meta-analysis]]''': Though independent [[p-value]]s can be combined using [[Fisher's method]], techniques are still being developed to handle the case of dependent p-values.
* '''[[Behrens–Fisher problem]]''': [[Yuri Linnik]] showed in 1966 that there is no [[uniformly most powerful test]] for the difference of two means when the variances are unknown and possibly unequal. That is, there is no [[exact test]] (meaning that, if the means are in fact equal, one that rejects the [[null hypothesis]] with [[significance level|probability exactly α]]) that is also the most powerful for all values of the variances (which are thus [[nuisance parameter]]s). Though there are many approximate solutions (such as [[Welch's t-test]]), the problem continues to attract attention&lt;ref&gt;Fraser, D.A.S.; [[Judith Rousseau|Rousseau, J.]] (2008) "Studentization and deriving accurate p-values". ''[[Biometrika]]'', 95 (1), 1&amp;mdash;16. {{doi|10.1093/biomet/asm093}}
&lt;/ref&gt; as one of the classic problems in statistics.
* '''[[Multiple comparisons]]''': There are various ways to adjust p-values to compensate for the simultaneous or [[sequential testing]] of hypothesis.  Of particular interest is how to simultaneously control the overall error rate,  preserve statistical power, and incorporate the dependence between tests into the adjustment. These issues are especially relevant when the number of simultaneous tests can be very large, as is increasingly the case in the analysis of data from [[DNA microarray]]s.{{citation needed|date=July 2012}}
*'''[[Bayesian statistics]]''': A list of open problems in Bayesian statistics has been proposed.&lt;ref&gt;Jordan, M. I. (2011). [http://www4.stat.ncsu.edu/~reich/st740/Bayesian_open_problems.pdf "What are the open problems in Bayesian statistics?"] ''The ISBA Bulletin'', 18(1).&lt;/ref&gt;

==Experimental design==
* As the theory of [[Latin square]]s is a cornerstone in the [[design of experiments]], solving the '''[[problems in Latin squares]]''' could have immediate applicability to experimental design.{{fact|date=August 2016}}

==Problems of a more philosophical nature==
* '''[[Sampling of species problem]]''': How is a probability updated when there is unanticipated new data?&lt;ref&gt;{{ cite journal | author=Zabell, S. L. | title=Predicting the unpredictable | year=1992 | journal=Synthese | volume=90 | page=205 | doi=10.1007/bf00485351}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''[[Doomsday argument]]''': How valid is the [[probability theory|probabilistic argument]] that claims to [[predict]] the [[future]] lifetime of the [[human race]] given only an estimate of the total number of humans born so far?
* '''[[Exchange paradox]]''': Issues arise within the [[Bayesian probability|subjectivistic interpretation]] of [[probability|probability theory]]; more specifically within [[Decision theory#Choice under uncertainty|Bayesian decision theory]].{{citation needed|date=July 2012}} This is still an open problem among the subjectivists as no consensus has been reached yet. Examples include:
** The [[two envelopes problem]]
** The [[necktie paradox]]
* '''[[Sunrise problem]]''': What is the probability that the sun will rise tomorrow? Very different answers arise depending on the methods used and assumptions made.

'''Metrology''' is the science of [[measurement]].&lt;ref name=BIPM&gt;{{cite web |title=''What is metrology?''

This led to the creation of the decimal-based [[metric system]] in 1795, establishing a set of standards for other types of measurements. Several other countries adopted the metric system between 1795 and 1875; to ensure conformity between the countries, the [[Bureau International des Poids et Mesures]] (BIPM) was established by the [[Metre Convention]].&lt;ref name = BGtoM/&gt;&lt;ref name="French-History"/&gt; This has evolved into the [[International System of Units]] (SI) as a result of a resolution at the 11th [[Conference Generale des Poids et Mesures]] (CGPM) in 1960.&lt;ref name=R12_11&gt;{{cite web|title=Resolution 12 of the 11th CGPM (1960)|url=http://www.bipm.org/en/CGPM/db/11/12/|publisher=Bureau International des Poids et Mesures|accessdate=28 February 2017|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6FsRVQEjh?url=http://www.bipm.org/en/CGPM/db/11/12/|archivedate=14 April 2013|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first being the definition of units of measurement, second the realisation of these units of measurement in practice, and last traceability, which is linking measurements made in practice to the reference standards. These overlapping activities are used in varying degrees by the three basic sub-fields of Metrology.&lt;ref name=C-S/&gt; The sub-fields are scientific or fundamental metrology, which is concerned with the establishment of [[units of measurement]], Applied, technical or industrial metrology, the application of measurement to manufacturing and other processes in society, and Legal metrology, which covers the regulation and statutory requirements for measuring instruments and the methods of measurement.

In each country, a national measurement system (NMS) exists as a network of laboratories, calibration facilities and accreditation bodies which implement and maintain its metrology infrastructure.&lt;ref name="National Measurement System"&gt;{{cite web|title=National Measurement System|url=http://www.npl.co.uk/nms|publisher=National Physical Laboratory|accessdate=5 March 2017|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170215230507/http://www.npl.co.uk/nms|archivedate=15 February 2017|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="NQI"/&gt; The NMS affects how measurements are made in a country and their recognition by the international community, which has a wide-ranging impact in its society (including economics, energy, environment, health, manufacturing, industry and consumer confidence).&lt;ref name="MSC"/&gt;&lt;ref name="AusEconomy"/&gt; The effects of metrology on trade and  economy are some of the easiest-observed societal impacts. To facilitate fair trade, there must be an agreed-upon system of measurement.&lt;ref name="AusEconomy"/&gt;

{{see also|History of measurement}}
The ability to measure alone is insufficient; standardisation is crucial for measurements to be meaningful.&lt;ref name="MSC-History"&gt;{{cite web|title=History of Metrology|url=http://www.msc-conf.com/history-of-metrology/|publisher=Measurement Science Conference|accessdate=28 February 2017|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170301094329/http://www.msc-conf.com/history-of-metrology/|archivedate=1 March 2017|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first record of a permanent standard was in 2900 BC, when the [[Cubit#Ancient Egyptian royal cubit|royal Egyptian cubit]] was carved from black [[granite]].&lt;ref name="MSC-History"/&gt; The cubit was decreed to be the length of the Pharaoh's forearm plus the width of his hand, and replica standards were given to builders.&lt;ref name = BGtoM/&gt; The success of a standardised length for the building of [[Giza pyramid complex|the pyramids]] is indicated by the lengths of their bases differing by no more than 0.05 percent.&lt;ref name="MSC-History"/&gt;

Other civilizations produced generally accepted measurement standards, with Roman and Greek architecture based on distinct systems of measurement.&lt;ref name="MSC-History"/&gt; The collapse of the empires and the Dark Ages which followed them lost much measurement knowledge and standardisation. Although local systems of measurement were common, comparability was difficult since many local systems were incompatible.&lt;ref name="MSC-History"/&gt; England established the Assize of Measures to create standards for length measurements in 1196, and the 1215 [[Magna Carta]] included a section for the measurement of wine and beer.&lt;ref name="NPL-HofL"&gt;{{cite web|title=History of Length Measurement|url=http://www.npl.co.uk/educate-explore/posters/history-of-length-measurement/|publisher=National Physical Laboratory|accessdate=28 February 2017|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170301094410/http://www.npl.co.uk/educate-explore/posters/history-of-length-measurement/|archivedate=1 March 2017|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Modern metrology has its roots in the [[French Revolution]]. With a political motivation to harmonise units throughout France, a length standard based on a natural source was proposed.&lt;ref name="MSC-History"/&gt; In March 1791, the [[metre]] was defined.&lt;ref name="French-History"&gt;{{cite web|title=History of measurement – from metre to International System of Units (SI) |url=http://www.french-metrology.com/en/history/history-mesurement.asp |publisher=La metrologie francaise |accessdate=28 February 2017 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110425025041/http://www.french-metrology.com/en/history/history-mesurement.asp |archivedate=25 April 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; This led to the creation of the decimal-based [[metric system]] in 1795, establishing standards for other types of measurements. Several other countries adopted the metric system between 1795 and 1875; to ensure international conformity, the [[International Bureau of Weights and Measures]] ({{lang-fr|Bureau International des Poids et Mesures}}, or BIPM) was established by the [[Metre Convention]].&lt;ref name = BGtoM/&gt;&lt;ref name="French-History"/&gt; Although the BIPM's original mission was to create international standards for units of measurement and relate them to national standards to ensure conformity, its scope has broadened to include electrical and [[Photometry (optics)|photometric]] units and [[ionizing radiation]] measurement standards.&lt;ref name="French-History"/&gt; The metric system was modernised in 1960 with the creation of the [[International System of Units]] (SI) as a result of a resolution at the 11th [[General Conference on Weights and Measures]] ({{lang-fr|Conference Generale des Poids et Mesures}}, or CGPM).&lt;ref name = R12_11/&gt;

==Fields of metrology==
Metrology is defined by the International Bureau of Weights and Measures (BIPM) as "the science of measurement, embracing both experimental and theoretical determinations at any level of uncertainty in any field of science and technology".&lt;ref name="WhatIsBIPM"&gt;{{cite web|title=What is metrology?|url=http://www.bipm.org/en/worldwide-metrology/|publisher=BIPM|accessdate=23 February 2017|ref=BIPMDef|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170324081343/http://www.bipm.org/en/worldwide-metrology/|archivedate=24 March 2017|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; It establishes a common understanding of units, crucial to human activity.&lt;ref name=FCM&gt;{{cite book|url = http://resource.npl.co.uk/international_office/metrologyinshort.pdf|title = Metrology in Industry – The Key for Quality|publisher = [[International Society for Technology in Education|ISTE]]|author = Collège français de métrologie [French College of Metrology]|editor-first = Dominique|editor-last = Placko|year = 2006|isbn = 978-1-905209-51-4|deadurl = no|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20121023153656/http://resource.npl.co.uk/international_office/metrologyinshort.pdf|archivedate = 2012-10-23|df = }}&lt;/ref&gt; Metrology is a wide reaching field, but can be summarized through three basic activities: the definition of internationally accepted units of measurement, the realisation of these units of measurement in practice, and the application of chains of traceability (linking measurements to reference standards).&lt;ref name=FCM/&gt;&lt;ref name=C-S/&gt; These concepts apply in different degrees to metrology's three main fields: scientific metrology; applied, technical or industrial metrology, and legal metrology.&lt;ref name=C-S/&gt;

===Scientific metrology===

Scientific metrology is concerned with the establishment of units of measurement, the development of new measurement methods, the realisation of measurement standards, and the transfer of traceability from these standards to users in a society.&lt;ref name=FCM/&gt;&lt;ref name = BGtoM/&gt; This type of metrology is considered the top level of metrology which strives for the highest degree of accuracy.&lt;ref name=FCM/&gt; BIPM maintains a database of the metrological calibration and measurement capabilities of institutes around the world. These institutes, whose activities are peer-reviewed, provide the fundamental reference points for metrological traceability. In the area of measurement, BIPM has identified nine metrology areas, which are acoustics, electricity and magnetism, length, mass and related quantities, photometry and radiometry, ionizing radiation, time and frequency, thermometry, and chemistry.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web  |url = http://kcdb.bipm.org/appendixc/  |title = The BIPM key comparison database  |publisher = BIPM  |accessdate = 26 Sep 2013  |deadurl = no  |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20130928041400/http://kcdb.bipm.org/appendixc/  |archivedate = 2013-09-28  |df =   }}&lt;/ref&gt;

There is a proposed redefinition of the [[SI base unit]]s that was formally voted on in November 2018&lt;ref&gt;{{cite conference |conference=SIM XXII General Assembly |location=Montevideo, Uruguay |url=http://www.sim-metrologia.org.br/docs/2016Presentations/BIPM%202016.pdf#page=10 |conference-url=http://www.sim-metrologia.org.br/docs/2016Presentations/ |page=10 |title=Highlights in the work of the BIPM in 2016 |first=Martin |last=Milton |date=14 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;, and will come into effect in May 2019.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bipm.org/en/committees/cipm/meeting/105.html Decision CIPM/105-13 (October 2016)]&lt;/ref&gt; The motivation in the change of the base units is to make the entire system derivable from [[physical constants]], which requires the removal of the prototype kilogram as it is the last artefact the unit definitions depend on.&lt;ref name="SD"&gt;{{cite web|title=New measurement will help redefine international unit of mass: Ahead of July 1 deadline, team makes its most precise measurement yet of Planck's constant|url=https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2017/07/170701103514.htm|website=ScienceDaily|publisher=ScienceDaily|accessdate=23 March 2018|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Scientific metrology plays an important role in this redefinition of the units as precise measurements of the physical constants is required to have accurate definitions of the base units. To redefine the value of a kilogram without an artefact the value of the [[Planck constant]] must be known to twenty parts per billion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://physicsworld.com/cws/article/indepth/2011/mar/22/metrology-in-the-balance|title = Metrology in the balance|first1 = Robert P.|last1 = Crease|accessdate = 23 March 2018|work = Physics World|publisher = [[Institute of Physics]]|date = 22 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Scientific metrology, through the development of the [[Kibble balance]] and the [[Avogadro project]], has produced a value of Planck constant with low enough uncertainty to allow for a redefinition of the kilogram.&lt;ref name="SD"/&gt;

===Applied, technical or industrial metrology===

Applied, technical or industrial metrology is concerned with the application of measurement to manufacturing and other processes and their use in society, ensuring the suitability of measurement instruments, their calibration and quality control.&lt;ref name=FCM/&gt; Producing good measurements is important in industry as it has an impact on the value and quality of the end product, and a 10-15% impact on production costs.&lt;ref name=C-S/&gt; Although the emphasis in this area of metrology is on the measurements themselves, traceability of the measuring-[[Measuring instrument|device]] calibration is necessary to ensure confidence in the measurement. Recognition of the metrological competence in industry can be achieved through mutual recognition agreements, accreditation, or peer review.&lt;ref name=C-S/&gt; Industrial metrology is important to a country's economic and industrial development, and the condition of a country's industrial-metrology program can indicate its economic status.&lt;ref name = "silva"/&gt;

===Legal metrology===

Legal metrology "concerns activities which result from statutory requirements and concern measurement, units of measurement, measuring instruments and methods of measurement and which are performed by competent bodies".&lt;ref name=VIML&gt;{{cite book|title=International Vocabulary of Terms in Legal Metrology |url=http://www.oiml.org/publications/V/V001-ef00.pdf |publisher=OIML |year=2000 |page=7 |location=Paris |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070928030048/http://www.oiml.org/publications/V/V001-ef00.pdf |archivedate=September 28, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Such statutory requirements may arise from the need for protection of health, public safety, the environment, enabling taxation, protection of consumers and fair trade. The International Organization for Legal Metrology ([[OIML]]) was established to assist in harmonising regulations across national boundaries to ensure that legal requirements do not inhibit trade.&lt;ref name = "DeWayne"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Sharp|first1=DeWayne|title=Measurement, instrumentation, and sensors handbook|date=2014|publisher=CRC Press, Inc.|location=Boca Raton|isbn=978-1-4398-4888-3|edition=Second edition.}}&lt;/ref&gt; This harmonisation ensures that certification of measuring devices in one country is compatible with another countries certification process, allowing the trade of the measuring devices and the products that rely on them. [[WELMEC]] was established in 1990 to promote cooperation in the field of legal metrology in the [[European Union]] and among [[European Free Trade Association]] (EFTA) member states.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=WELMEC Secretariat|title=WELMEC An introduction|url=http://www.welmec.org/fileadmin/user_files/publications/WELMEC-general/WELMEC_Guide_1-2016_-_WELMEC_An_introduction.pdf|publisher=WELMEC|accessdate=28 February 2017|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170228165051/http://www.welmec.org/fileadmin/user_files/publications/WELMEC-general/WELMEC_Guide_1-2016_-_WELMEC_An_introduction.pdf|archivedate=28 February 2017|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the United States legal metrology is under the authority of the Office of Weights and Measures of [[National Institute of Standards and Technology]] (NIST), enforced by the individual states.&lt;ref name = "DeWayne"/&gt;

=== Definition of units ===
The [[International System of Units]] (SI) defines seven base units: length, mass, time, [[electric current]], [[thermodynamic temperature]], [[amount of substance]], and [[luminous intensity]].&lt;ref name="NIST_SI"&gt;{{cite web|title=SI base units|url=http://physics.nist.gov/cuu/Units/units.html|website=The NIST Reference on Constants, Units, and Uncertainty|publisher=National Institute of Standards and Technology|accessdate=15 February 2017|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170119053614/http://physics.nist.gov/cuu/Units/units.html|archivedate=19 January 2017|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; By convention, each of these units are considered to be mutually independent of each other; however, in reality they are interdependent given some definitions contain other base SI Units.&lt;ref name = SI111&gt;{{SIbrochure|pages=111}}&lt;/ref&gt; All other SI units are derived from the seven base units.&lt;ref&gt;{{SIbrochure|pages=118, 120}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since the base units are the reference points for all measurements taken in SI units, if the reference value changed all prior measurements would be incorrect. If a piece of the international prototype kilogram snapped off, it would still be defined as a kilogram; all previous measured values of a kilogram would be heavier.&lt;ref name=BGtoM&gt;{{cite web|last1=Goldsmith|first1=Mike|title=A Beginner's Guide to Measurement|url=http://www.npl.co.uk/upload/pdf/NPL-Beginners-Guide-to-Measurement.pdf|publisher=National Physical Laboratory|accessdate=16 February 2017|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170329111015/http://www.npl.co.uk/upload/pdf/NPL-Beginners-Guide-to-Measurement.pdf|archivedate=29 March 2017|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The importance of reproducible SI units has led the BIPM to begin defining base SI units in terms of [[physical constant]]s.&lt;ref name=redef&gt;{{cite web|title=On the future revision of the SI|url=http://www.bipm.org/en/measurement-units/rev-si/|publisher=Bureau International des Poids et Mesures|accessdate=16 February 2017|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170215111649/http://www.bipm.org/en/measurement-units/rev-si/|archivedate=15 February 2017|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; By defining base SI units with respect to physical constants, they are realisable with a higher level of precision and reproducibility.&lt;ref name = redef/&gt; With the redefinition of the SI units occurring on May 20th, 2019 the [[kilogram]], [[ampere]], [[kelvin]], and [[Mole (unit)|mole]] will then be defined by setting exact numerical values for the [[Planck constant]] (''{{Math|h}}''), the [[elementary electric charge]] (''{{Math|e}}''), the [[Boltzmann constant]] (''{{Math|k}}''), and the [[Avogadro constant]] ({{Math|''N''&lt;sub&gt;A&lt;/sub&gt;}}), respectively.

=== Realisation of units ===

[[File:CGKilogram.jpg|thumb|alt=Computer-generated image of a small cylinder|Computer-generated image realising the international prototype kilogram (IPK), made from an alloy of 90-percent platinum and 10-percent iridium by weight]]
The [[Realisation (metrology)|realisation]] of a unit of measure is its conversion into reality.&lt;ref name=OED&gt;{{OED|Realise}}&lt;/ref&gt; Three possible methods of realisation are defined by the [[Joint Committee for Guides in Metrology#VIM: International vocabulary of metrology|international vocabulary of metrology]] (VIM): a physical realisation of the unit from its definition, a highly-reproducible measurement as a reproduction of the definition (such as the [[quantum Hall effect]] for the [[ohm]]), and the use of a material object as the measurement standard.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=International vocabulary of metrology&amp;mdash;Basic and general concepts and associated terms (VIM)|date=2012|publisher=[[International Bureau of Weights and Measures]] on behlaf of the Joint Committee for Guides in Metrology|page=46|edition=3rd|url=http://www.bipm.org/utils/common/documents/jcgm/JCGM_200_2012.pdf|accessdate=1 March 2017|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170317223139/http://www.bipm.org/utils/common/documents/jcgm/JCGM_200_2012.pdf|archivedate=17 March 2017|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Standards ===

A [[Standard (metrology)|standard]] (or etalon) is an object, system, or experiment with a defined relationship to a unit of measurement of a physical quantity.&lt;ref&gt;Phillip Ostwald,Jairo Muñoz, ''Manufacturing Processes and Systems (9th Edition)''John Wiley &amp; Sons, 1997 {{ISBN|978-0-471-04741-4}} page 616&lt;/ref&gt; Standards are the fundamental reference for a system of weights and measures by realising, preserving, or reproducing a unit against which measuring devices can be compared.&lt;ref name=FCM/&gt; There are three levels of standards in the hierarchy of metrology: primary, secondary, and working standards.&lt;ref name="silva"&gt;{{cite book|last1=de Silva|first1=G. M. S|title=Basic Metrology for ISO 9000 Certification|date=2012|publisher=Routledge|location=Oxford|isbn=1-136-42720-1|pages=12–13|edition=Online-Ausg.|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=0akABAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA13&amp;lpg=PA13&amp;dq=standards+hierarchy+metrology&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=VMyW0MPSAL&amp;sig=kziWErFv0k_dtc-EjphSzdVjV_8&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjW3tzX_5fSAhVh6IMKHR2RCoUQ6AEIfTAU#v=onepage&amp;q=standards%20hierarchy%20metrology&amp;f=false|accessdate=17 February 2017|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180227045858/https://books.google.com/books?id=0akABAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA13&amp;lpg=PA13&amp;dq=standards+hierarchy+metrology&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=VMyW0MPSAL&amp;sig=kziWErFv0k_dtc-EjphSzdVjV_8&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjW3tzX_5fSAhVh6IMKHR2RCoUQ6AEIfTAU#v=onepage&amp;q=standards%20hierarchy%20metrology&amp;f=false|archivedate=27 February 2018|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Primary standards (the highest quality) do not reference any other standards. Secondary standards are calibrated with reference to a primary standard. Working standards, used to calibrate (or check) measuring instruments or other material measures, are calibrated with respect to secondary standards. The hierarchy preserves the quality of the higher standards.&lt;ref name = "silva"/&gt; An example of a standard would be [[gauge blocks]] for length. A gauge block is a block of metal or ceramic with two opposing faces ground precisely flat and parallel, a precise distance apart.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Doiron|first1=Ted|last2=Beers|first2=John|title=The Gauge Block Handbook|url=https://www.nist.gov/sites/default/files/documents/calibrations/mono180.pdf|publisher=NIST|accessdate=23 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The length of the path of light in vacuum during a time interval of 1/299,792,458 of a second is embodied in an artefact standard such as a gauge block; this gauge block is then a primary standard which can be used to calibrate secondary standards through mechanical comparators.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=e-Handbook of Statistical Methods|url=https://www.itl.nist.gov/div898/handbook/mpc/section3/mpc312.htm|publisher=NIST/SEMATECH|accessdate=23 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Traceability and calibration===

[[File:Traceability Pyramid.png|thumb|upright=1.5|alt=Pyramid illustrating the relationship between traceability and calibration|Metrology traceability pyramid]]
Metrological traceability is defined as the "property of a measurement result whereby the result can be related to a reference through a documented unbroken chain of calibrations, each contributing to the measurement uncertainty".&lt;ref name=VIM&gt;{{Cite book |url= http://www.bipm.org/utils/common/documents/jcgm/JCGM_200_2008.pdf |title= International vocabulary of metrology — basic and general concepts and associated terms |publisher= Joint Committee on Guides for Metrology (JCGM) |year= 2008 |edition= 3 |deadurl= no |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20110110120304/http://www.bipm.org/utils/common/documents/jcgm/JCGM_200_2008.pdf |archivedate= 2011-01-10 |df=  }}&lt;/ref&gt; It permits the comparison of measurements, whether the result is compared to the previous result in the same laboratory, a measurement result a year ago, or to the result of a measurement performed anywhere else in the world.&lt;ref name=WMO&gt;{{cite web|title=Metrological Traceability for Meteorology|url=https://www.wmo.int/pages/prog/www/IMOP/publications/Flyers/Traceability_flyer.pdf|publisher=World Meteorological Organization Commission for Instruments and Methods of Observation|accessdate=2 March 2017|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170317094030/http://www.wmo.int/pages/prog/www/IMOP/publications/Flyers/Traceability_flyer.pdf|archivedate=17 March 2017|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The chain of traceability allows any measurement to be referenced to higher levels of measurements back to the original definition of the unit.&lt;ref name=FCM/&gt;

Traceability is most often obtained by [[calibration]], establishing the relationship between an indication on a measuring instrument (or secondary standard) and the value of the standard. A calibration is an operation that establishes a relation between a measurement standard with a known measurement uncertainty and the device that is being evaluated. The process will determine the measurement value and uncertainty of the device that is being calibrated and create a traceability link to the measurement standard. &lt;ref name = VIM/&gt; The four primary reasons for calibrations are to provide traceability, to ensure that the instrument (or standard) is consistent with other measurements, to determine accuracy, and to establish reliability.&lt;ref name=FCM/&gt; Traceability works as a pyramid, at the top level there is the international standards, at the next level national metrology institutes calibrate the primary standards through realisation of the units creating the traceability link from the primary standard and the unit definition.&lt;ref name=WMO/&gt; Through subsequent calibrations between national metrology institutes, calibration laboratories, and industry and testing laboratories the realisation of the unit definition is propagated down through the pyramid.&lt;ref name=WMO/&gt; The traceability chain works upwards from the bottom of the pyramid, where measurements done by industry and testing laboratories can be directly related to the unit definition at the top through the traceability chain created by calibration.&lt;ref name = BGtoM/&gt;

=== Uncertainty ===

[[Measurement uncertainty]] is a value associated with a measurement which expresses the spread of possible values associated with the [[measurand]]—a quantitative expression of the doubt existing in the measurement.&lt;ref name="EUROLAB"&gt;{{cite book|title=Guide to the Evaluation of Measurement Uncertainty for Quantitative Test Results|date=August 2006|publisher=EUROLAB|location=Paris, France|page=8|url=http://www.eurolab.org/documents/EL_11_01_06_387%20Technical%20report%20-%20Guide%20Measurement%20uncertainty.pdf|accessdate=2 March 2017|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161123053518/http://www.eurolab.org/documents/EL_11_01_06_387%20Technical%20report%20-%20Guide%20Measurement%20uncertainty.pdf|archivedate=23 November 2016|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are two components to the uncertainty of a measurement: the width of the uncertainty interval and the confidence level.&lt;ref name="BGtoU"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Bell|first1=Stephanie|title=A Beginner's Guide to Uncertainty of Measurement|date=March 2001|publisher=National Physical Laboratory|location=Teddington, Middlesex, United Kingdom|issn=1368-6550|edition=Issue 2|url=https://www.wmo.int/pages/prog/gcos/documents/gruanmanuals/UK_NPL/mgpg11.pdf|accessdate=2 March 2017|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170503205533/https://www.wmo.int/pages/prog/gcos/documents/gruanmanuals/UK_NPL/mgpg11.pdf|archivedate=3 May 2017|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The uncertainty interval is a range of values that the measurement value is expected to fall within, while the confidence level is how likely the true value is to fall within the uncertainty interval. Uncertainty is generally expressed as follows:&lt;ref name = FCM/&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;Y = y \pm U&lt;/math&gt;  
:Coverage factor: ''k'' = 2
Where ''y'' is the measurement value and ''U'' is the uncertainty value and ''k'' is the coverage factor{{efn|Equivalent to standard deviation if the uncertainty distribution is normal}} indicates the confidence interval. The upper and lower limit of the uncertainty interval can be determined by adding and subtracting the uncertainty value from the measurement value. The coverage factor of ''k'' = 2 generally indicates a 95% confidence that the measured value will fall inside the uncertainty interval.&lt;ref name = FCM/&gt; Other values of ''k'' can be used to indicate a greater or lower confidence on the interval, for example ''k'' = 1 and ''k'' = 3 generally indicate 66% and 99.7% confidence respectively.&lt;ref name="BGtoU"/&gt;  The uncertainty value is determined through a combination of statistical analysis of the calibration and uncertainty contribution from other errors in measurement process, which can be evaluated from sources such as the instrument history, manufacturer's specifications, or published information.&lt;ref name="BGtoU"/&gt;

== International infrastructure ==
Several international organizations maintain and standardise metrology.

=== Metre Convention ===

The [[Metre Convention]] created three main [[international organization]]s to facilitate standardisation of weights and measures.  The first, the General Conference on Weights and Measures (CGPM), provided a forum for representatives of member states. The second, the International Committee for Weights and Measures (CIPM), was an advisory committee of metrologists of high standing. The third, the International Bureau of Weights and Measures (BIPM), provided secretarial and laboratory facilities for the CGPM and CIPM.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bipm.org/en/convention/|title=The Metre Convention|publisher=Bureau International des Poids et Mesures|date=|accessdate=1 October 2012|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120926202046/http://www.bipm.org/en/convention/|archivedate=26 September 2012|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====General Conference on Weights and Measures====
The [[General Conference on Weights and Measures]] ({{lang-fr|Conférence générale des poids et mesures}}, or CGPM) is the convention's principal decision-making body, consisting of delegates from member states and non-voting observers from associate states.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.bipm.org/en/convention/cgpm/|title = General Conference on Weights and Measures|year = 2011|publisher = Bureau International des Poids et Mesures|accessdate = 26 September 2012|deadurl = yes|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20120926233323/http://www.bipm.org/en/convention/cgpm/|archivedate = 26 September 2012|df = }}&lt;/ref&gt; The conference usually meets every four to six years to receive and discuss a CIPM report and endorse new developments in the SI as advised by the CIPM. The last meeting was held November 13-16, 2018. On the last day of this conference there was vote on the redefinition of four base units, which the [[International Committee for Weights and Measures]] (CIPM) had proposed earlier that year.&lt;ref name=cipm_106&gt;

====International Committee for Weights and Measures====

The [[International Committee for Weights and Measures]] ({{lang-fr|Comité international des poids et mesures}}, or CIPM) is made up of eighteen (originally fourteen)&lt;ref&gt;Convention of the Metre (1875), Appendix 1 (Regulation), Article 8&lt;/ref&gt; individuals from a member state of high scientific standing, nominated by the CGPM to advise the CGPM on administrative and technical matters. It is responsible for ten consultative committees (CCs), each of which investigates a different aspect of metrology; one CC discusses the measurement of temperature, another the measurement of mass, and so forth. The CIPM meets annually in [[Sèvres]] to discuss reports from the CCs, to submit an annual report to the governments of member states concerning the administration and finances of the BIPM and to advise the CGPM on technical matters as  needed. Each member of the CIPM is from a different member state, with France (in recognition of its role in establishing the convention) always having one seat.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.bipm.org/en/committees/cipm/|title = CIPM: International Committee for Weights and Measures|year = 2011|publisher = Bureau International des Poids et Mesures|accessdate = 26 September 2012|deadurl = no|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20120924192125/http://www.bipm.org/en/committees/cipm/|archivedate = 24 September 2012|df = }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.bipm.org/en/committees/cipm/cipm_criteria.html|title = Criteria for membership of the CIPM|year = 2011|publisher = Bureau International des Poids et Mesures|accessdate = 26 September 2012|deadurl = yes|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20120527174210/http://www.bipm.org/en/committees/cipm/cipm_criteria.html|archivedate = 27 May 2012|df = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[International Bureau of Weights and Measures]] ({{lang-fr|Bureau international des poids et mesures}}, or BIPM) is an organisation based in Sèvres, France which has custody of the [[Kilogram#International prototype kilogram|international prototype kilogram]], provides metrology services for the CGPM and CIPM, houses the secretariat for the organisations and hosts their meetings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Mission, Role and Objectives|url=https://www.bipm.org/utils/en/pdf/BIPM-MissionRoleObjectives.pdf|publisher=BIPM|accessdate=26 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=IPK&gt;{{cite web|title=International Prototype of the Kilogram|url=https://www.bipm.org/en/bipm/mass/ipk/|publisher=BIPM|accessdate=26 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Over the years, international prototype metres and kilograms have been returned to BIPM headquarters for recalibration.&lt;ref name=IPK/&gt; The BIPM director is an [[ex officio member]] of the CIPM and a member of all consultative committees.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Criteria for membership of a Consultative Committee|url=https://www.bipm.org/en/committees/cc/cc-criteria.html|publisher=BIPM|accessdate=26 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== International Organization of Legal Metrology ===

The [[International Organization of Legal Metrology]] ({{lang-fr|Organisation Internationale de Métrologie Légale}}, or OIML), is an [[intergovernmental organization]] created in 1955 to promote the global harmonisation of the legal metrology procedures facilitating international trade.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Convention establishing an International Organisation of Legal Metrology|volume=2000 (E)|url=https://www.oiml.org/en/files/pdf_b/b001-e68.pdf|accessdate=24 March 2017|publisher=Bureau International de Métrologie Légale|location=Paris|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140712233521/http://www.oiml.org/en/files/pdf_b/b001-e68.pdf|archivedate=12 July 2014|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; This harmonisation of technical requirements, test procedures and test-report formats ensure confidence in measurements for trade and reduces the costs of discrepancies and measurement duplication.&lt;ref name=strategy&gt;{{cite journal|url = https://www.oiml.org/en/files/pdf_b/b015-e11.pdf|title = OIML Strategy|volume = OIML B 15|edition = 2011 (E)|publisher = Bureau International de Métrologie Légale|location = Paris|accessdate = 24 March 2017|deadurl = no|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20161202233613/https://www.oiml.org/en/files/pdf_b/b015-e11.pdf|archivedate = 2 December 2016|df = }}&lt;/ref&gt; The OIML publishes a number of international reports in four categories:&lt;ref name=strategy/&gt;
*Recommendations: Model regulations to establish metrological characteristics and conformity of measuring instruments 
*Informative documents: To harmonise legal metrology
*Guidelines for the application of legal metrology
*Basic publications: Definitions of the operating rules of the OIML structure and system

Although the OIML has no legal authority to impose its recommendations and guidelines on its member countries, it provides a standardised legal framework for those countries to assist the development of appropriate, harmonised legislation for certification and calibration.&lt;ref name=strategy/&gt; OIML provides a mutual acceptance arrangement (MAA) for measuring instruments that are subject to legal metrological control, which upon approval allows the evaluation and test reports of the instrument to be accepted in all participating countries.&lt;ref name="OIMLMAA"&gt;{{cite web|title=MAA certificates|url=https://www.oiml.org/en/certificates/maa-certificates|publisher=OIML|accessdate=25 March 2018|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Issuing participants in the agreement issue MAA Type Evaulation Reports of MAA Certificates upon demonstration of compliance with ISO/IEC 17065 and a peer evaluation system to determine competency.&lt;ref name="OIMLMAA"/&gt; This ensures that certification of measuring devices in one country is compatible with the certification process in other participating countries, allowing the trade of the measuring devices and the products that rely on them.

[[File:National Measurement System Overview.png|thumb|alt=Block diagram|Overview of a national measurement system]]
A national metrology institute's (NMI) role in a country's measurement system is to conduct scientific metrology, realise base units, and maintain primary national standards.&lt;ref name=FCM/&gt; An NMI provides traceability to international standards for a country, anchoring its national calibration hierarchy.&lt;ref name=FCM/&gt; For a national measurement system to be recognized internationally by the CIPM Mutual Recognition Arrangement, an NMI must participate in international comparisons of its measurement capabilities.&lt;ref name="NQI"/&gt; BIPM maintains a comparison database and a list of calibration and measurement capabilities (CMCs) of the countries participating in the CIPM MRA.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The BIPM key comparison database|url=http://kcdb.bipm.org/|publisher=Bureau International des Poids et Mesures|accessdate=5 March 2017|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170129024102/http://kcdb.bipm.org/|archivedate=29 January 2017|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Not all countries have a centralised metrology institute; some have a lead NMI and several decentralised institutes specialising in specific national standards.&lt;ref name=FCM/&gt; Some examples of NMI's are the [[National Institute of Standards and Technology]] (NIST)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=International Legal Organizational Primer|url=https://www.nist.gov/pml/weights-and-measures/international-legal-metrology/ilmp-organizational-primer|website=NIST|accessdate=25 March 2018|language=en|date=14 January 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; in the United States, the [[National Research Council (Canada)|National Research Council]] (NRC)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Measurement science and standards - National Research Council Canada|url=https://www.nrc-cnrc.gc.ca/eng/rd/mss/index.html|publisher=National Research Council of Canada|accessdate=25 March 2018|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; in Canada, the [[Korea Research Institute of Standards and Science]] (KRISS)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=KRISS|url=http://www.kriss.re.kr/eng/about/about01.html|publisher=KRISS|accessdate=25 March 2018|language=ko}}&lt;/ref&gt;, and the [[National Physical Laboratory of India]] (NPL-India)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Profile - National Physical Laboratory|url=http://www.nplindia.in/npl-profile|publisher=National Physical Laboratory|accessdate=25 March 2018|language=en|date=17 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

=== Calibration laboratories ===
Calibration laboratories are generally responsible for calibrations of industrial instrumentation.&lt;ref name="NQI"/&gt; Calibration laboratories are accredited and provide calibration services to industry firms, which provides a traceability link back to the national metrology institute. Since the calibration laboratories are accredited, they give companies a traceability link to national metrology standards.&lt;ref name=FCM/&gt; Examples of calibration laboratories would be ICL Calibration Laboratories&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=About Us|url=https://icllabs.com/about-us/|publisher=ICL Calibration|accessdate=25 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;, Testo Industrial Services GmbH&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Testo Industrial Services GmbH – Company|url=http://www.testotis.com/language=en/6802/company|publisher=Testo Industrial Services GmbH|accessdate=25 March 2018|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;, and Transcat&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=About Us - Transcat|url=http://www.transcat.com/about-us|publisher=Transcat|accessdate=25 March 2018|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

=== Accreditation bodies ===
An organisation is accredited when an authoritative body determines, by assessing the organisation's personnel and management systems, that it is competent to provide its services.&lt;ref name="NQI"/&gt; For international recognition, a country's accreditation body must comply with international requirements and is generally the product of international and regional cooperation.&lt;ref name="NQI"/&gt; A laboratory is evaluated according to international standards such as [[ISO/IEC 17025]] general requirements for the competence of testing and calibration laboratories.&lt;ref name=FCM/&gt; To ensure objective and technically-credible accreditation, the bodies are independent of other national measurement system institutions.&lt;ref name="NQI"/&gt; The [[National Association of Testing Authorities]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=NATA - About Us|url=http://www.nata.com.au/about-nata|publisher=NATA|accessdate=25 March 2018|language=en-gb}}&lt;/ref&gt; in Australia, the [[United Kingdom Accreditation Service]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=About UKAS|url=https://www.ukas.com/about/|publisher=UKAS|accessdate=25 March 2018|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;, and [[National Accreditation Board for Testing and Calibration Laboratories]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Introduction|url=http://www.nabl-india.org/about-nabl/introduction/|publisher=NABL|accessdate=25 March 2018|date=25 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; in India, are examples of accreditation bodies.

== {{anchor|Societal impact}}Impacts ==
Metrology has wide-ranging impacts on a number of sectors, including economics, energy, the environment, health, manufacturing, industry, and consumer confidence.&lt;ref name="MSC"&gt;{{cite web|title=Metrology for Society's Challenges|url=https://www.euramet.org/metrology-for-societys-challenges/|publisher=EURAMET|accessdate=9 March 2017|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170312083228/https://www.euramet.org/metrology-for-societys-challenges/|archivedate=12 March 2017|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="AusEconomy"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Robertson|first1=Kristel|last2=Swanepoel|first2=Jan A.|title=The economics of metrology|date=September 2015|publisher=Australian Government, Department of Industry, Innovation and Science|url=https://industry.gov.au/Office-of-the-Chief-Economist/Research-Papers/Documents/2015-Research-Paper-6-The-economics-of-metrology.pdf|accessdate=9 March 2017|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160307031140/http://www.industry.gov.au/Office-of-the-Chief-Economist/Research-Papers/Documents/2015-Research-Paper-6-The-economics-of-metrology.pdf|archivedate=7 March 2016|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The effects of metrology on trade and the economy are two of its most-apparent societal impacts.

Several studies have indicated that increased standardization in measurement has a positive impact on [[Gross domestic product|GDP]]. In the United Kingdom, an estimated 28.4 percent of GDP growth from 1921 to 2013 was the result of standardisation; in Canada between 1981 and 2004 an estimated nine percent of GDP growth was standardisation-related, and in Germany the annual economic benefit of standardization is an estimated 0.72% of GDP.&lt;ref name="AusEconomy"/&gt;

Legal metrology has reduced accidental deaths and injuries with measuring devices, such as [[radar gun]]s and [[breathalyzer]]s, by improving their efficiency and reliability.&lt;ref name="LegalMetImpact"/&gt; Measuring the human body is challenging, with poor [[repeatability]] and [[reproducibility]], and advances in metrology help develop new techniques to improve health care and reduce costs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Metrology for Society's Challenges - Metrology for Health|url=https://www.euramet.org/metrology-for-societys-challenges/metrology-for-health/|publisher=EURAMET|accessdate=9 March 2017|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170312083223/https://www.euramet.org/metrology-for-societys-challenges/metrology-for-health/|archivedate=12 March 2017|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Environmental policy is based on research data, and accurate measurements are important for assessing [[climate change]] and environmental regulation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Metrology for Society's Challenges - Metrology for Environment|url=https://www.euramet.org/metrology-for-societys-challenges/metrology-for-environment/|publisher=EURAMET|accessdate=9 March 2017|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170312083340/https://www.euramet.org/metrology-for-societys-challenges/metrology-for-environment/|archivedate=12 March 2017|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Aside from regulation, metrology is essential in supporting innovation, the ability to measure provides a technical infrastructure and tools that can then be used to pursue further innovation. By providing a technical platform which new ideas can be built upon, easily demonstrated, and shared, measurement standards allow new ideas to be explored and expanded upon.&lt;ref name="AusEconomy"/&gt;

'''Neptec Design Group'''  is an [[Ottawa]] based, Canadian vision systems company, providing machine vision solutions for space, industrial, and military applications.  Privately owned and founded in 1990, Neptec is a [[NASA]] prime contractor, supplying [[Advanced Space Vision System|operational systems]] to both the Space Shuttle and International Space Station programs. Starting in 2000, Neptec began expanding its technology to include active 3D imaging systems and 3D processing software. This work led directly to the development of Neptec's [[Laser Camera System]], which is an operational system used by [[NASA]] to inspect the shuttle's external surfaces during flight.  Building on Laser Camera System technology, Neptec has also developed a 3D imaging and tracking system designed for automated on-orbit rendezvous, inspection and docking.   The [[TriDAR]] combines a high precision, short range triangulation sensor with a long range [[LIDAR]] sensor into the same [[optical path]].

==Laser Camera System==
The Laser Camera System (LCS) is short-range, high precision autosynchronous triangulation scanner. The camera uses a laser to measure the distance between itself and points on a target and is able to create a three-dimensional representation of the area it has scanned.

First demonstrated on the Shuttle Discovery Mission [[STS-105]] in August 2001, Neptec's prototype LCS was the first dual target tracking and imaging three-dimensional scanner to fly in space. It wasn't until 2004, after the [[Space Shuttle Columbia]] [[Space Shuttle Columbia disaster|tragedy]] that the LCS became a primary focus to both Neptec and NASA.

To ensure the safety of future missions, NASA required a means to determine the amount of damage, if any, sustained by a shuttle during the launch phase. In response to this requirement, Neptec Design Group developed the Laser Camera System (LCS) in 14 months. The LCS made its first mission in July 2005 on NASA's [[STS-114]] Return to Flight shuttle mission and was a mandatory system for subsequent shuttle missions.

The LCS was part of a larger sensor system that is installed on a 50-foot boom extension that provided additional reach for the [[Remote Manipulator System]] (Canadarm). This [[Orbiter Boom Sensor System]] (OBSS) was used to inspect areas of the shuttle that were previously not visible to the astronauts inside. The LCS was used to scan and characterize the underside of the shuttle while in orbit. While looking at the shuttle's tiles and panels from the height of a first story window, Neptec's scanner was able to detect cracks less than a millimeter thick. Because it was a 3D scanner, it was also able to measure the depth of cracks or holes that were found. The scanner then sent these measurements to Earth where the data was analyzed in detail by Neptec engineers in NASA's Mission Control Center in Houston, Texas.  During STS-114, critical on-orbit data was often processed and in the hands of the Space Shuttle mission managers within an hour of being collected on orbit.

Neptec's LCS continued to fly as an operational part of the OBSS on the remaining Space Shuttle Missions.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="12193">The '''PANOSE''' System is a method for [[Typeface#Style of typefaces|classifying]] [[typeface]]s solely on their visual characteristics, developed by [[Benjamin Bauermeister]]. It can be used to identify an unknown [[font]] from a sample image or to match a known font to its closest visual neighbor from a font pool. The word "PANOSE" is composed of letters taken from the six classes in which the creator of the system organized the Latin alphabet.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=qrElYgVLDwYC&amp;pg=PA424&amp;lpg=PA424&amp;dq=Benjamin+Bauermeister+panose&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=4grGp040MP&amp;sig=1H7JWLmIm18wD8gMzYy6zi3XY1o&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=zldNStT_BZ66jAeettC-BQ&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=8 Yannis Haralambous, Fonts &amp; Encodings, O'Reilly Media, 2007, p. 424.] {{ISBN|0-596-10242-9}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The original PANOSE System was developed in 1985 by [[Benjamin Bauermeister]]. In 1988, it was published by Van Nostrand Reinhold Company Inc. under the title ''A Manual of Comparative Typography: The PANOSE System''. This initial version of the PANOSE system consisted of seven classification categories and was based on subjective visual parameters.

In 1990, the Weight category was added, and the Arm Style category was split off from the Stroke Variation category, bringing the number of classification categories to 9. Objective classification criteria were also added at this time.

In 1991, the Family Kind category was added, completing the PANOSE 1.0 definition.

In 1992, there were attempts made to classify Han ideographic typefaces, which allows applications to suggests the most appropriate Latin typeface to match a given Han ideographic typeface. Transliteral mapping could also be used to match between, for example, decorative or script faces and text equivalents.

In 1993, Mapper Application Interface (MAI) was developed. PANOSE 2.0 was also released in the same year, which is the basis for Hewlett Packard's Infinifont font synthesis technology.

PANOSE was incorporated into a variety of digital font metadata tags in 1992 by ElseWare Corporation. The classification system, its matching [[algorithm]]s reference databases, classification parameters, and trademarks were purchased by [[Hewlett Packard]] in 1995. A font synthesis engine named [[Infinifont]] was also purchased by Hewlett Packard at that time.

==Revisions==

===1.0===
It was published in 1988. A PANOSE classification number consists of 10 concatenated values. Each value from a given category was computed from a specific visual metric, such as the weight of the font and the presence or absence of serifs. Special values "Any" (0) and "No Fit" (1) exist for every category, which have specific meanings to the mapper. "Any" means match that digit with any available digit, which allows the mapper to handle distortable typefaces. "No Fit" means that the item being classified does not fit within the present system.

The standard classifies fonts in following categories in following order:
*Family: The Family value defines what type of font is being classified, which affects the valid values available for the latter categories, and the categories available. Different category definitions exist for Latin Text, Latin Hand Written, Latin Decorative, Latin Symbol, Iconographic, Japanese Text, Cyrillic Text and Hebrew.{{Citation needed|date=December 2008}}

====Latin Text categories====
*'''Serif Style:''' it describes the appearance of the serifs used in a font design and groups them into one of 14 general categories. Serif and sans serif faces are classified within this digit.
*'''Weight:''' it classifies the appearance of a font's stem thickness in relation to its height. It offers 10 gradations, ranging from Very Light to Extra Black.
*'''Proportion:''' it describes the relative proportions of the characters in the font. Distinguishes Monospaced from Proportional, Modern from Old Style, and Extended from Condensed.
*'''Contrast:''' it describes the ratio between the thickest and narrowest points on the letter O. The uppercase O is used because it is generally of higher contrast than the other characters of the alphabet.
*'''Stroke Variation:''' it specifies the relationship between the thicknesses of the thin stems and the wide stems. It further details the contrast trait by describing the kind of transition that occurs as the stem thickness changes on rounded glyph shapes.
*'''Arm Style:''' it classifies special treatment of diagonal stems and termination of open rounded letterforms. The letter A and C are used extensively for this classification, along with G, M, S, V, W, and Y.
*'''Letterform:''' it classifies roundness of the character shapes and the predominant skewing of the character forms.
*'''Midline:''' it describes the placement of the midline across the uppercase characters and the treatment of diagonal stem apexes.
*'''X-height:''' it describes the treatment of uppercase glyphs with diacritical marks and the relative size of the lowercase characters.

====Example====
For example, the PANOSE digits for Times New Roman are:
{| class="wikitable"
|Family Kind
|'''2''' (Latin text)
|-
|Serif Style
|'''2''' (Cove)
|-
|Weight
|'''6''' (Medium)
|-
|Proportion
|'''3''' (Modern)
|-
|Contrast
|'''5''' (Medium low)
|-
|Stroke variation
|'''4''' (Transitional)
|-
|Arm style
|'''5''' (Straight arms)
|-
|Letterform
|'''2''' (Round)
|-
|Midline
|'''3''' (Standard)
|-
|X-height
|'''4''' (Large) 
|}

===2.0===
The system stores actual measurement data under the Rich Font Description (RFD) rather than bucketing it, which allows the matching system to use mathematical distance rather than penalty tables. It is designed for distortable font technologies (e.g.: Multi Master fonts). The system offers multiple methods for distortable fonts.

The original classification system was changed from a bucket-based system to an arithmetic system (except the Family from PANOSE 1.0 and derivatives), and was expanded to following categories:
{| class="wikitable"
|-
!1.0!! 2.0
|-
|Family||Class, Genre
|-
|Serif Style||Serif Measure, Serif Tall Measure, Serif Tip Measure, Serif Hip Roundness, Serif Tip Roundness, Serif Angle, Serif Drop Measure, Serif Balance Measure, Serif Foot Pitch Measure, Serif Cup Measure
|-
|Weight||Weight Measure
|-
|Proportion||Monospace Flag, Distortion Measure, Ratio Measure
|-
|Contrast||Narrow Stem Measure
|-
|Stroke||Speed Factor, Stress-up Angle, Stress-low Angle
|-
|Arm Style||Stem Taper Factor, Stem Dishing Measure, Stem Bowing Measure, Stem Termination Type, Stem Termination Angle
|-
|Letterform||Slant Angle, Outer Curve Factor, Side Flat Factor, Top Flat Factor, Bowl Mid-out Measure
|-
|Midline||Mid "E" Measure, Mid "A" Measure, Apex Trim Factor, Apex Serif Flag
|-
|X-Height||X-Tall Measure, Diacritical Location
|-
|none||Cap-Scale Factor
|}
Each PANOSE 2.0 category value is a signed 16-bit number (from −32,768 to 32,767; only ranges between −10,000 and 10,000 are defined), where value zero (0) is considered to be the "normal" for the digit. For example, digit zero for the weight represents medium weight. The "any" value from PANOSE 1.0 is translated to a "don't care" parameter and is replaced by the more comprehensive distortable font descriptions.

The Family category is replaced by Class and Genre, where Class indicates a font's language and character set, where Genre indicates text faces, display faces, symbol faces, and so on. PANOSE matching software is designed to match fonts with different Class, but same Genre. The same Genre can have different meaning in different Class, so the matching heuristic decides the closeness of fonts based on adjusted values based on Class, rather than raw PANOSE values within the fonts themselves.

==PANOSE Classification Procedures==
Classification Procedures are objective measurement techniques used to assign a PANOSE number to a font.

==PANOSE Mapper software==
The PANOSE Mapper software determines the closest possible font match on any given system by comparing the PANOSE numbers of the requested and available fonts. The individual PANOSE digits are compared, weighted by their typographic importance, and summed to provide a numerical visual distance. Typographic importance is derived by assigning weights to each digit; for example, a font's weight (regular, bold, demibold, etc.) is more important than its contrast (difference between thick and thin strokes).

==Standardizations==
PANOSE 1.0 table is supported in [[TrueType]] font format.

PANOSE 2.0 is used in ElseWare Corporation's Infinifont parametric font generation system.

In 1996, during the [[W3C]]'s draft process for [[Cascading Style Sheets|CSS1]], Hewlett Packard proposed a PANOSE syntax extension for [[font substitution]]. It was not included in the final CSS1 recommendation partly because of licensing concerns. Although Hewlett Packard Co. is not interested in profiting from PANOSE, it will negotiate licenses on a time and materials basis.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.w3.org/Printing/stevahn.html PANOSE: An Ideal Typeface Matching System for the Web]&lt;/ref&gt;

PANOSE 1.0 is supported in [[SVG]] since version 1.0 in the ''font-face'' element under ''panose-1'' attribute.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.w3.org/TR/SVG10/fonts.html#FontFaceElement 20.8.3 The 'font-face' element]&lt;/ref&gt; In [[CSS2]], it is used in the ''panose-1'' property,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.w3.org/TR/1998/REC-CSS2-19980512/fonts.html#descdef-panose-1 15.3.6 Descriptors for Matching: 'panose-1', 'stemv', 'stemh', 'slope', 'cap-height', 'x-height', 'ascent', and 'descent']&lt;/ref&gt; which was removed in CSS2.1, and was reintroduced in ''[[CSS3]] module: Web Fonts'' specifications.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.w3.org/TR/css3-webfonts/#matching 2.6. Descriptors for Matching: 'panose-1', 'stemv', 'stemh', 'slope', 'cap-height', 'x-height', 'ascent', and 'descent']&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Office Open XML]], it is part of WordProcessingML.&lt;ref&gt;[https://blogs.msdn.com/johnrdurant/archive/2005/08/08/wordmlpanose.aspx WordML and Panose- Yes, Panose!]&lt;/ref&gt;

PANOSE 1.0 is used in [[Rich Text Format]] Specification 1.7.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.softhelp.ru/fileformat/rtf17/Word2002RTFSpecificationFinal.htm RTF Version 1.7]{{dead link|date=March 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2349">'''Pubarche''' refers to the first appearance of [[pubic hair]] at [[puberty]]. Pubarche&lt;ref&gt;The word results from the combination of a Latin and a Greek word: pub-es, "adult, full-grown, manly", and ἀρχή {{IPA-el|arkʰɛ̌ː|}}, "beginning, onset".&lt;/ref&gt; is one of the physical changes of puberty and can occur independently of complete puberty. Pubarche usually results from rising levels of [[estrogen]]s in females, and [[androgen]]s in males from the [[adrenal gland]]s, [[ovary |ovaries]], or [[testis|testes]] but may also result from exposure to an [[anabolic steroid]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Blueprints Obstetrics &amp; Gynecology|first1=Tamara L. |last1=Callahan|first2= Aaron B.|last2= Caughey|first3= Linda|last3= Heffner|publisher=Blackwell Publishing|year= 2003|isbn=1-4051-0331-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When pubarche occurs prematurely (in early or mid-childhood), it is referred to as ''premature pubarche'' or [[precocious puberty]] and may warrant an evaluation. Premature [[adrenarche]] is the most common cause of premature pubarche. Early occurrences can arise due to [[congenital adrenal hyperplasia]], [[androgen]]-producing tumors of the adrenals or [[gonad]]s. When adrenarche, central puberty, and all pathologic conditions have been excluded, the term ''isolated premature pubarche'' is used to describe the unexplained development of pubic hair at an early age without other hormonal or physical changes of puberty.

==Average age==

{{see also|Tanner scale}}

The average beginning of pubarche varies due to many factors, including climate, nourishment, weight, nurture, and genes. First (and often transient) pubic hair resulting from [[adrenarche]] may appear between ages 10-12 preceding puberty.

During puberty pubarche tends to occur earlier in girls than boys, as with most puberty stages and puberty as a whole. The average age for females varies between 12-14, and for males, about 13-15. {{citationneeded|date=March 2014}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="16099">The '''Research Assessment Exercise''' ('''RAE''') was an exercise undertaken approximately every 5 years on behalf of the four UK [[higher education]] funding councils ([[Higher Education Funding Council for England|HEFCE]], [[SHEFC]], [[HEFCW]], [[Department for Employment and Learning|DELNI]]) to evaluate the quality of research undertaken by British higher education institutions. RAE submissions from each subject area (or ''unit of assessment'') are given a rank by a subject specialist peer review panel. The rankings are used to inform the allocation of quality weighted research funding (QR) each higher education institution receives from their national funding council.  Previous RAEs took place in 1986, 1989, 1992, 1996 and 2001. The most recent results were published in December 2008.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=RAE 2008|url=http://www.rae.ac.uk/|work=Research Assessment Exercise|accessdate=20 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was replaced by the [[Research Excellence Framework]] in 2014.

Various media have produced league tables of institutions and disciplines based on the 2008 RAE results. Different methodologies lead to  similar but non-identical rankings.

==History==
The first exercise of assessing of research in Higher Education in the UK took place in 1986 under the [[Margaret Thatcher]] Government.  It was conducted by the [[University Grants Committee (UK)|University Grants Committee]] under the chairmanship of the Cambridge mathematician [[Peter Swinnerton-Dyer]]. The purpose of the exercise was to determine the allocation of funding to UK Universities at a time of tight budgetary restrictions. The committee received submissions of research statements from 37 subject areas ("cost centres") within Universities, along with five selected research outputs. It issued quality rankings labelled "outstanding", "above average", "average" or "below average". The research funding allocated to Universities (called "quality-related" funding) depended on the quality ratings of the subject areas. According to Swinnerton-Dyer, the objective was to establish a measure of transparency to the allocation of funding at a time of declining budgets.&lt;ref name=THE&gt;Paul Jump, [https://www.timeshighereducation.com/features/evolution-of-the-ref/2008100.article Evolution of the REF], Times Higher Education, 17 October 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

A subsequent research assessment was conducted in 1989 under the name "research selectivity exercise" by the [[Universities Funding Council]]. Responding to the complaint of the Universities that they weren't allowed submit their "full strength," Swinnerton-Dyer allowed the submission of two research outputs per every member of staff. The evaluation was also expanded to 152 subject areas ("units of assessment"). According to Roger Brown and Helen Carasso, only about 40 per cent of the research-related funding was allocated based on the assessment of the submissions. The rest was allocated based on staff and student numbers and research grant income.&lt;ref name=THE/&gt;

In 1992, the distinction between Universities and Polytechnics was [[New Universities|abolished]].  The Universities Funding Council was replaced by regionwise funding councils such as the [[Higher Education Funding Council for England|HEFCE]]. Behram Bekhradnia, the directory of policy at HEFCE, came to the conclusion that the research assessment needed to become "much more robust and rigorous." This led to the institution of the Research Assessment Exercise in 1992. The results of the 1992 results were nevertheless challenged in Court by the Institute of Dental Surgery and the judge warned that the system had to become more transparent. The assessment panels in the subsequent exercises had to be much more explicit about the criteria for evaluation and the working methods. In 1996, all volume-based evaluation was removed to account for the criticism that volume rather than quality was rewarded.&lt;ref name=THE/&gt;

The 1992 exercise also stipulated that the staff submitted for assessment had to be in post by a specific date (the "census date") in order to counter the criticisms that the staff that had moved on were still counted in the assessment. This led to the phenomenon of "poaching" of highly qualified staff by other Universities ahead of the census date. In the 2001 exercise, the credit for the staff that moved institutions in the middle of the cycle could be shared between the two institutions. In the 2008 exercise, this was abolished.&lt;ref name=THE/&gt;

The assessment of 2008 also brought in a major change. Instead of a single grade for an entire subject area ("unit of assessment"), a grade was assigned to each research output. This was done to counter the criticism that large departments were able to hide a "very long tail" of lesser work and still get high ratings and, conversely, excellent staff in low-graded departments were unable to receive adequate funding. Thus the single grades for units of assessment were replaced by "quality profiles," which indicated the proportion of each department's research against each quality category.&lt;ref name=THE/&gt;

==Scale==

===2008===

The 2008 RAE used a four-point quality scale, and returned a profile, rather than a single aggregate quality score, for each unit.
The quality levels—based on assessment of research outputs, research environment and indicators of esteem—are defined as:

{| class="wikitable"
! Rating !! Description
|-
| 4* || Quality that is world-leading in terms of originality, significance and rigour
|-
| 3* || Quality that is internationally excellent in terms of originality, significance and rigour but which nonetheless falls short of the highest standards of excellence
|-
| 2* || Quality that is recognised internationally in terms of originality, significance and rigour
|-
| 1* || Quality that is recognised nationally in terms of originality, significance and rigour
|-
| Unclassified || Quality that falls below the standard of nationally recognised work. Or work which does not meet the published definition of research for the purposes of this assessment.
|}

Each unit of assessment was given a ''quality profile'' - a five-column histogram - indicating the proportion of the research that meets each of four quality levels or is unclassified.

===Earlier Assessments===
In 1992, 1996 and 2001, the following descriptions were used for each of the ratings.

{| class="wikitable"
! 2001 &amp; 1996 Rating !! 1992 Rating !! Description
|-
| 5* || 5* || Research quality that equates to attainable levels of international excellence in more than half of the research activity submitted and attainable levels of national excellence in the remainders.
|-
| 5 || 5 || Research quality that equates to attainable levels of international excellence in up to half of the research activity submitted and to attainable levels of national excellence in virtually all of the remainder. (Same definition)
|-
| 4 || 4 || Research quality that equates to attainable levels of national excellence in virtually all of the research activity submitted, showing some evidence of international excellence. (Same definition)
|-
| 3a || 3 || Research quality that equates to attainable levels of national excellence in over two-thirds of the research activity submitted, possibly showing evidence of international excellence. (Research quality that equates to attainable levels of national excellence in a majority of the sub-areas of activity, or to international level in some)
|-
| 3b || 3 || Research quality that equates to attainable levels of national excellence in more than half of the research activity submitted. (Research quality that equates to attainable levels of national excellence in a majority of the sub-areas of activity, or to international level in some)
|-
| 2 || 2 || Research quality that equates to attainable levels of national excellence in up to half of the research activity submitted. (Same definition)
|-
| 1 || 1 || Research quality that equates to attainable levels of national excellence in none, or virtually none, of the research activity submitted. (Same definition)
|}

These ratings have been applied to "units of assessment", such as French or Chemistry, which often broadly equate to university departments. Various unofficial league tables have been created of university research capability by aggregating the results from units of assessment.{{Citation needed|date=September 2007}} Compiling league tables of universities based on the RAE is problematic, as volume and quality are both significant factors.

==Assessment process==
The assessment process for the RAE focuses on quality of research outputs (which usually means papers published in academic journals and conference proceedings), research environment, and indicators of esteem. Each subject panel determines precise rules within general guidance. For RAE 2008, institutions are invited to submit four research outputs, published between January 2001 and December 2007, for each full-time member of staff selected for inclusion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Definitions|url=http://www.rae.ac.uk/aboutus/defini.asp|work=RAE 2008|accessdate=20 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In response to criticism of earlier assessments, and developments in employment law, the 2008 RAE does more to take into account part-time workers or those new to a sufficient level of seniority to be included in the process.

==Criticism==
The RAE has not been without its critics. In its different iterations, it has divided opinion among researchers, managers and policy makers.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Alis|first=Oancea|year=2014|title=Research assessment as governance technology in the United Kingdom: findings from a survey of RAE 2008 impacts.|url=https://ora.ox.ac.uk/objects/uuid:8d77fdf0-c716-44f4-8b33-e66e90b84a20|journal=Zeitschrift für Erziehungswissenschaft|volume=17|pages=83–110|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Amongst the criticisms is the fact that it explicitly ignores the publications of most full-time researchers in the UK, on the grounds that they are employed on fixed term contracts. According to the RAE 2008 guidelines, most research assistants are "not eligible to be listed as research active staff".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rae.ac.uk/Pubs/2005/03/rae0305.doc ''RAE 2008 Guidelines'' Para 79]&lt;/ref&gt; Publications by researchers on fixed term contracts are excluded from the Assessment Exercise unless those publications can be credited to a member of staff who is eligible for the RAE.  This applies even if the member of staff being assessed only made a minor contribution to the article.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Madden|first=Andrew|title=The researchers the RAE forgot|url=https://www.theguardian.com/education/2008/dec/19/rae-researchers-ignored|accessdate=20 August 2013|newspaper=Guardian|date=19 December 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The opposite pheonomenon is also true, where non-research active staff on permanent contracts, such as lecturers who have been responsible primarily for teaching activities have also found themselves placed under deeper contractual pressure by their employing universities to produce research output.  Another issue is that it is doubtful whether panels of experts have the necessary expertise to evaluate the quality of research outputs, as experts perform much less well as soon as they are outside their particular area of specialisation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Corbyn|first=Zoe|title=RAE's non-specialist gambit could have led to blunders, says study|url=http://www.timeshighereducation.co.uk/406434.article|work=Times Higher Education|accessdate=20 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since 1996 the [[Association of University Teachers|AUT]], now incorporated within the [[University and College Union|UCU]], has maintained a policy of opposition to the Research Assessment Exercise.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=RAE 2008|url=http://www.ucu.org.uk/index.cfm?articleid=1442|work=University and College Union|accessdate=20 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; In its view,
{{quote|The RAE has had a disastrous impact on the UK higher education system, leading to the closure of departments with strong research profiles and healthy student recruitment. It has been responsible for job losses, discriminatory practices, widespread demoralisation of staff, the narrowing of research opportunities through the over-concentration of funding and the undermining of the relationship between teaching and research.}}

The official ''Review of Research Assessment,'' the 2003 "Roberts Report" commissioned by the UK funding bodies,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rareview.ac.uk/reports/roberts.asp ''Review of research assessment''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070720232304/http://www.rareview.ac.uk/reports/roberts.asp |date=20 July 2007 }} - report by [[Gareth Roberts (physicist)|Sir Gareth Roberts]] to the UK funding bodies, May 2003&lt;/ref&gt; recommended changes to research assessment, partly in response to such criticisms.

The House of Commons Science and Technology Select Committee considered the Roberts report, and took a more optimistic view,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200304/cmselect/cmsctech/586/58602.htm |title=Science and Technology - Eleventh Report |publisher=UK Parliament |date=23 September 2004 |accessdate=5 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; asserting that, ''"the RAE had had positive effects: it had stimulated universities into managing their research and had ensured that funds were targeted at areas of research excellence",'' it concluded that ''"there had been a marked improvement in universities' research performance"''. Nevertheless, it argued that ''"the RAE in its present form had had its day"'', and proposed a reformed RAE, largely based on Roberts' recommendations.

==Planned changes to RAE system==
It was announced&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Shepherd|first=Jessica|title=A difficult patch|url=https://www.theguardian.com/education/2007/jan/30/researchassessmentexercise.research|accessdate=20 August 2013|newspaper=Guardian|date=30 January 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;  in the 2006 [[Budget]] that after the 2008 exercise a system of [[Metric (mathematics)|metrics]] would be developed in order to inform future allocations of QR funding. Following initial consultation with the higher education sector, it is thought that the Higher Education Funding Councils will introduce a metrics based system of assessment for subjects in science, technology, engineering and medicine. A process of peer review is likely to remain for mathematics, statistics, arts, humanities and social studies subjects.

HEFCE has developed a new set of arrangements, known as the [[Research Excellence Framework]] (REF),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Research Excellence Framework|url=http://www.ref.ac.uk/|work=REF 2014|accessdate=20 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  which has been introduced as a follow on to the 2008 RAE.

'''Research development''' ('''RD''') is a set of strategic, proactive, catalytic, and capacity-building activities designed to facilitate individual faculty members, teams of researchers, and central research administrations in attracting extramural research funding, creating relationships, and developing and implementing strategies that increase institutional competitiveness.&lt;ref&gt;What is Research Development?  The National Organization of Research Development Professionals.  http://www.nordp.org/what-is-research-development-&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref name="Budescu &amp;amp; Walker"&gt;Budescu, G. and Walker, B.L.E. 2012. Social Scientists and Research Development: What Do Research Development Professionals Do? American Sociological Association, Footnotes, February 2012, p. 3; http://www.asanet.org/sites/default/files/footnotes_feb12_final_2.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;  These activities are typically practiced at universities, but are also in use at a variety of other research institutions.&lt;ref&gt;National Organization of Research Development Professionals 2017 brochure. http://www.nordp.org/assets/brochures/nordp-brochure-2017.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

Research development includes a diverse set of dynamic activities that vary by institution.  These activities include initiating and nurturing partnerships, networks, and alliances between and among faculty at their institutions and funding agencies; and designing and implementing strategic services for their faculty and researcher constituents (such as workshops, trainings, program officer visits, proposal editing, PR communications, funding opportunity searches and dissemination, budget preparation, forms and submission assistance, research team building, and administering campus limited submission reviews).&lt;ref&gt;http://nordp.org/&lt;/ref&gt;

Research development professionals initiate and nurture critical partnerships and alliances throughout the institutional research enterprise and between institutions and with their external stakeholders. With the goal of enabling competitive individual and team research and facilitating research excellence, research development professionals build and implement strategic services and collaborative resources that span across disciplinary and administrative barriers within their organizations and beyond.&lt;ref name="Levin"&gt;Levin, J. 2011. The Emergence of the Research-Development Professional. Chronicle of Higher Education, March 27, 2011. http://chronicle.com/article/The-Emergence-of-the/126906/&lt;/ref&gt;

Research development differs significantly from university development (institutional [[fundraising]] or advancement) in that RD is not aimed at attracting contributions or donations.  Rather, RD strengthens research programs and proposals to make them more competitive for extramural contracts and grants from governmental, private and non-profit funding agencies.  Similarly, RD should not be confused with [[research and development]] (R&amp;D) which refers to investments in (often) corporate scientific and technological research that leads to new products and applications.

Recent contractions in the availability of public and private research funding have intensified competition for fewer resources among universities.  This trend has amplified the need for research development assistance and interventions at universities in order to enhance research excellence and competitiveness.&lt;ref&gt;Mason, E. and L. Learned. 2006. The Role of “Development” in a Research Administration Office. J. Res. Admin. 37(1): 23-34.&lt;/ref&gt;  These services have not traditionally been offered through university-sponsored research and projects offices that administer the submission of grant proposals and research funds management.  In response to these challenges, research development is increasingly becoming a standard practice at universities,&lt;ref name="Budescu &amp;amp; Walker" /&gt; &lt;ref name="Levin" /&gt; particularly research universities (defined, by the [[Carnegie Classification of Institutions of Higher Education]], as universities that place a high priority on research and rely heavily on extramural funding).&lt;ref&gt;The Carnegie Classification of Institutions of Higher Education. Carnegie Foundation for the Advancement of Teaching. http://classifications.carnegiefoundation.org/&lt;/ref&gt;

Research development professionals and services are typically housed in a university's central "Office of Research" (or similar), or within a more specific department or research unit devoted to a particular discipline or school.{{Citation needed|date=March 2013}} Research development activities are also included in some sponsored research and projects offices. There are also independent consulting firms that provide research development services.{{Citation needed|date=March 2013}}  According to the US-based National Organization of Research Development Professionals (NORDP), there are currently over 800 research development professionals employed at over 300 institutions (colleges/universities, teaching/not-for-profit hospitals, independent not-for-profit research organizations, national laboratories, research organizations wholly organized and administered by a college or university, consortia of colleges and universities, associations/societies with individual or institutional members predominantly from colleges and universities) across the United States and several foreign countries.&lt;ref&gt;National Organization of Research Development Professionals. http://www.nordp.org/assets/brochures/nordp-brochure-2017.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

==NORDP National Organization of Research Development Professionals==
The National Organization of Research Development Professionals (NORDP) was established in 2010 as part of a grassroots movement to build a peer community of research development professionals. The organization grew from an informal network of over 100 individuals engaged in research development activities at universities and research institutions across the United States. The central goals of NORDP are to serve these professionals, by providing a formal organization to support their professional development, to enhance institutional research competitiveness, and to catalyze new research and institutional collaborations.&lt;ref&gt;NORDP. http://nordp.org/index.php&lt;/ref&gt;

==Team science==
Team science is "scientific collaboration, i.e., research conducted by more than one individual in an interdependent fashion"&lt;ref name="NAS"&gt;Cooke, N.J. and Hilton, M.L., eds. 2015. Enhancing the Effectiveness of Team Science. Washington, D.C.: National Academies Press, p. 22&lt;/ref&gt;. It can involve work by small teams, but the term is more commonly used to describe large multi-, inter- and transdisciplinary collaborative research projects by large teams of scientists that often integrate research with broader goals including education, technology transfer, outreach and diversity enhancement. Research development is an activity that many universities have embraced to enhance the efforts of their faculty and foster the development of collaborative, team-based science as well as compete for large research center and consortia funding opportunities. Research development professionals serve as "rainmakers" who catalyze and facilitate team science in response to the external funding landscape.&lt;ref&gt;Stokols, D., K. L. Hall, et al. 2008.

'''rnn''' is an open-source [[machine learning]] framework that implements [[Recurrent Neural Network]] architectures, such as [[LSTM]] and [[gated recurrent unit|GRU]], natively in the [[R (programming language)|R]] programming language.

The '''rnn''' package is distributed through the [[Comprehensive R Archive Network]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=CRAN - Package rnn|url=https://cran.r-project.org/package=rnn}}&lt;/ref&gt; under the [[Open-source software|open-source]] [[GPL v3]] license.

== Workflow ==
The below example from the '''rnn''' documentation show how to train a recurrent neural network to solve the problem of bit-by-bit binary addition.

&lt;source lang="rsplus"&gt;
&gt; # install the rnn package, including the dependency sigmoid
&gt; install.packages('rnn')

&gt; # load the rnn package
&gt; library(rnn)

&gt; # create input data 
&gt; X1 = sample(0:127, 10000, replace=TRUE)
&gt; X2 = sample(0:127, 10000, replace=TRUE)

&gt; # create output data
&gt; Y &lt;- X1 + X2

&gt; # convert from decimal to binary notation 
&gt; X1 &lt;- int2bin(X1, length=8)
&gt; X2 &lt;- int2bin(X2, length=8)
&gt; Y  &lt;- int2bin(Y,  length=8)

&gt; # move input data into single tensor
&gt; X &lt;- array( c(X1,X2), dim=c(dim(X1),2) )

&gt; # train the model
&gt; model &lt;- trainr(Y=Y,
+                 X=X,
+                 learningrate   =  1,
+                 hidden_dim     = 16  )
Trained epoch: 1 - Learning rate: 1
Epoch error: 0.839787019539748
&lt;/source&gt;

The [[sigmoid function]]s and derivatives used in the package were originally included in the package, from version 0.8.0 onwards, these were released in a separate R package '''sigmoid''', with the intention to enable more general use. The '''sigmoid''' package is a dependency of the '''rnn''' package and therefore automatically installed with it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=CRAN - Package sigmoid|url=https://cran.r-project.org/package=sigmoid}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Reception ==
With the release of version 0.3.0 in April 2016&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://github.com/bquast/rnn/releases/tag/0.3.0|title=bquast/rnn|website=GitHub|language=en|access-date=2018-07-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; the use in production and research environments became more widespread. The package was reviewed several months later on the R blog The Beginner Programmer as "R provides a simple and very user friendly package named '''rnn''' for working with recurrent neural networks.",&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://firsttimeprogrammer.blogspot.com/2016/08/plain-vanilla-recurrent-neural-networks.html|title=The Beginner Programmer: Plain vanilla recurrent neural networks in R: waves prediction|last=Mic|date=2016-08-05|website=The Beginner Programmer|access-date=2018-07-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; which further increased usage.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://datascience.stackexchange.com/questions/6964/lstm-or-other-rnn-package-for-r|title=LSTM or other RNN package for R|website=Data Science Stack Exchange|access-date=2018-07-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The book [https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/neural-networks-with/9781788397872/ Neural Networks in R] by Balaji Venkateswaran and Giuseppe Ciaburro uses '''rnn''' to demonstrate [[recurrent neural networks]] to R users.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/neural-networks-with/9781788397872/9219bb11-a546-4e48-aa5f-689cc720228e.xhtml|title=Neural Networks with R|last=|first=|date=September 2017|work=Neural Networks with R|access-date=2018-10-02|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181002130929/https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/neural-networks-with/9781788397872/9219bb11-a546-4e48-aa5f-689cc720228e.xhtml|archive-date=2018-10-02|publisher=O'Reilly|language=en|isbn=9781788397872}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The RStudio CRAN mirror download logs
&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=RStudio CRAN logs|url=http://cran-logs.rstudio.com/}}&lt;/ref&gt; show that the package is downloaded on average about 1000 per month from those servers
,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=CRANlogs rnn package|url=https://cranlogs.r-pkg.org/badges/rnn}}&lt;/ref&gt; with a total of over 20,000 downloads since the first release
,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=CRANlogs rnn package|url=https://cranlogs.r-pkg.org/badges/grand-total/rnn}}&lt;/ref&gt; according to RDocumentation.org, this puts the package in the 15th percentile of most popular R packages

In [[computing]], a '''Self-organising heuristic''' is an [[algorithm]] that modifies a [[data structure]] such as a [[linked list]] in response to use of the data structure.

Examples might be:

* [[Move-to-front transform|Move-to-front]] (or 'Move to top')
* Self-learning [[Frequency list]] (or 'Order by access frequency')
* Re-insert at random position
* Move to back

==Example Applications==
''Move to front'', or ''Order by access frequency'', might be used to organize a [[cache (computing)|cache]] of [[information]], so that frequently used, or recently used information is at the top (and so can be found quickly, without having to traverse the whole list). 

''Order by frequency'' might be used to re-arrange a list of options in a GUI menu, so that the top ones are the ones most commonly selected by the user.

''Re-insert at random'' or ''Move to back'' might be used to organise a list of mirror [[server (computing)|server]]s, so that once a server has been used for downloading, it goes to the back of the [[Queue (data structure)|queue]], to discourage the user from selecting it again.

==Education and early career==
Emerson received a [[Bachelor of Arts]] from [[Brown University]] in 1976, and a [[Master of Arts]] in [[sociology]] in 1977.&lt;ref name=bio /&gt; He went to Washington, D.C., in 1977 with the intention of putting off his law school studies for a year.&lt;ref name="ha"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.haaretz.com/hasen/pages/ShArt.jhtml?itemNo=153448&amp;contrassID=3&amp;subContrassID=0&amp;sbSubContrassID=0|title=Foresight, hindsight|last=Landau|first=Benny|date=December 26, 2009|work=[[Haaretz]]|accessdate=January 28, 2010}}{{Dead link|date=June 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=no }}&lt;/ref&gt;  He worked on staff as an investigator for the U.S. Senate [[United States Senate Committee on Foreign Relations|Foreign Relations Committee]] until 1982, and as an executive assistant to [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic]] Senator [[Frank Church]] of [[Idaho]].&lt;ref name=EmersonSecret&gt;Emerson, Steven.

==Journalist and commentator==
Emerson was a freelance writer for ''[[The New Republic]]'', for whom he wrote a series of articles in 1982 on the influence of [[Saudi Arabia]] on U.S. corporations, law firms, public-relations outfits, and educational institutions. In their pursuit of large contracts with Saudi Arabia, he argued, U.S. businesses became unofficial, unregistered lobbyists for Saudi interests.&lt;ref name=NYTimesReview&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1985/07/11/arts/books-saudi-influence.html | work = The New York Times | author = Bernard Gwertzman | title = Books: Saudi Influence | date = July 11, 1985 | accessdate=March 2, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; He expanded this material in 1985 in his first book, ''The American House of Saud: The Secret Petrodollar Connection''.&lt;ref name=bio /&gt; Emerson has contributed commentaries to [[Newsmax]] since July 2009, covering terrorism-related topics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Emerson|first=Steve|title=Steve Emerson&amp;nbsp;— Radical Monitor|url=http://www.newsmax.com/blogs/Emerson/id-56|publisher=Newsmax|accessdate=December 10, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===''U.S. News and World Report'' and CNN===
From 1986 to 1989 he worked for ''[[U.S. News and World Report]]'' as a senior editor specializing in national security issues.&lt;ref name=EmersonSecret/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://nl.newsbank.com/nl-search/we/Archives?p_product=SL&amp;p_theme=sl&amp;p_action=search&amp;p_maxdocs=200&amp;p_topdoc=1&amp;p_text_direct-0=0EB04BFF5D0972EE&amp;p_field_direct-0=document_id&amp;p_perpage=10&amp;p_sort=YMD_date:D&amp;s_trackval=GooglePM |title=Mink, Eric, "Fitting 'Iran-Contra' Into U.S. History," ''St. Louis Post-Dispatch'', January 30, 1989.

Reviewing the book, ''[[The New York Times]]'' wrote: "Among the grace notes of Mr. Emerson's fine book are many small, well-told stories".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Powers |first=Thomas |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1988/06/26/books/soldiers-of-misfortune.html?pagewanted=1 |title=Powers, Thomas, "Solderies of Misfortune," ''The New York Times'', June 26, 1988.

In 1990, he co-authored ''The Fall of Pan Am 103: Inside the Lockerbie Investigation'', which argued for the then-mainstream theory that Iran was behind the bombing of [[Pan Am Flight 103]]. Reviewing the book, ''The New York Times'' wrote: "Mr. Emerson and Mr. Duffy have put together a surpassing account of the investigation to date, rich with drama and studded with the sort of anecdotal details that give the story the appearance of depth and weight."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1990/04/29/books/on-the-trail-of-the-terrorists.html?pagewanted=1|title=ON THE TRAIL OF THE TERRORISTS|date=April 29, 1990|work=The New York Times}}&lt;/ref&gt; The newspaper listed it as an "editors' choice" on their Best Sellers List, and cited it as a "notable book of the year".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1990/05/06/books/best-sellers-may-6-1990.html?pagewanted=all |title="Best Sellers", ''The New York Times'', May 6, 1990.

In 1990, he joined [[Cable News Network|CNN]] as an investigative correspondent and continued to write about terrorism. In 1991, he published ''Terrorist: The Inside Story of the Highest-Ranking Iraqi Terrorist Ever to Defect to the West'', detailing how Iraq spread and increased its terror network in the 1980s with U.S. support.&lt;ref name=bio /&gt;

===''Jihad in America''===
Emerson left CNN in 1993 to work on a documentary, ''[[Terrorists Among Us: Jihad in America]]'', for the [[Public Broadcasting Service]] (PBS).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=F4AYGALitgsC&amp;pg=PA176 |title=''Terrorism today'', Christopher C. Harmon, Routledge, 2000, ISBN 0-7146-4998-8, accessed January 29, 2010 |publisher=Books.google.com |date= |accessdate=March 25, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It aired as "a PBS special" in November 1994.&lt;ref&gt;"HBO's 'Hardcore TV' Lampoons All of Pop Culture - But Not Spam" Scott Williams / The Associated Press 18 November 1994&lt;/ref&gt;

In the documentary, he stood in front of the [[World Trade Center (1973–2001)|Twin Towers]] and warned: &lt;blockquote&gt;"The survivors of the explosion at the World Trade Center in 1993 are still suffering from the trauma, but as far as everyone else is concerned, all this was a spectacular news event that is over. Is it indeed over? The answer is: apparently not. A network of Muslim extremists is committed to a ''[[jihad]]'' against America. Their ultimate aim is to establish a Muslim empire."&lt;ref name=ha /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Emerson noted at the outset that "the overwhelming majority of Muslims are not members of militant groups." But the message of the documentary was that Muslim organizations have ties with militants who preach violence against moderate Muslims, as well as against Christians and Jews, and that charitable contributions to those organizations inevitably become "extremist." He documented meetings in American hotels at which Muslims called for a holy war, raised funds for "terror" organizations.&lt;ref name=ha /&gt; He also filmed Muslim-American youth training with weapons in summer camps, and interviewed supporters of terror who he claims operated under the cover of charitable organizations.&lt;ref name=ha /&gt;

He showed videos of Muslim speakers such as [[Abdullah Azzam]] in Brooklyn urging his audience to wage ''[[jihad]]'' in America (which Azzam explains "means fighting only, fighting with the sword"), Fayiz Azzam (a cousin of Abdullah) telling an Atlanta audience: &lt;blockquote&gt;"Blood must flow. There must be widows; there must be orphans, hands and limbs must be severed, and limbs and blood must be spread everywhere in order that Allah's religion can stand on its feet",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=NTJnnJNinSgC&amp;pg=PA210 |title=Gabriel, Brigitte, "Because they hate: a survivor of Islamic terror warns America," Macmillan, 2006, ISBN 0-312-35837-7, accessed January 29, 2010 |publisher=Books.google.com |date= |accessdate=March 25, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Goodman"&gt;{{cite news|last=Goodman |first=Walter |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1994/11/21/arts/television-review-in-jihad-in-america-food-for-uneasiness.html?pagewanted=1 |title=Goodman, Walter, "Television Review; In 'Jihad in America,' Food for Uneasiness," ''The New York Times'', November 21, 1994.

and Sheik [[Omar Abdel-Rahman]] in Detroit (later convicted of conspiring to blow up several New York City landmarks, and sentenced to life in prison) calling for ''jihad'' against the infidel. Sheik Mohammed Al-Asi of Chicago said: "If the Americans are placing their forces in the Persian Gulf, we should be creating another war front for the Americans in the Muslim world," and at a November 1993 [[Hamas]] rally in New Jersey hundreds chanted: "We buy paradise with the blood of the Jews."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1995/02/18/opinion/l-islamic-extremists-are-active-in-us-941495.html |title=Emerson, Steven, "Islamic Extremists Are Active in U.S.," ''The New York Times'', February 18, 1995. Retrieved January 29, 2010 |work=The New York Times |date=February 18, 1995 |accessdate=March 25, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Emerson added that: "As the activities of Muslim radicals expand in the United States, future attacks seem inevitable. Combating these groups within the boundaries of the [[United States Constitution|Constitution]] will be the greatest challenge to law enforcement since the war on organized crime."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nydailynews.com/archives/entertainment/1995/04 Mink, Eric, "Was 'Jihad' Extremely Prophetic?," ''The [[New York Daily News]]'', April 21, 1995. Retrieved January 28, 2010]{{Dead link|date=June 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=no }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Council on American-Islamic Relations]] (CAIR), a Muslim organization in Washington, noted that PBS denied requests by Arab and Muslim journalists to screen the program before its showing, and argued that Emerson was promoting "a wild theory about an Islamic terrorist network in America".&lt;ref name="Goodman"/&gt; Writing for ''The New York Times'', Walter Goodman opined that the request to change or cancel the documentary was not justified, but that the concerns about Emerson's claims of an Islamic terrorist network were justified "since 'Jihad in America' is likely to awaken viewers' unease over what some Muslim groups here may be up to."&lt;ref name="Goodman"/&gt;

After the film aired in South Africa, Emerson said that the [[Federal Bureau of Investigation]] (FBI) informed him that a South African Muslim group had dispatched a team to the U.S. to assassinate him. According to ''[[Slate (magazine)|Slate]]'', people who visit his Washington, D.C., office are blindfolded ''en route'', and employees call it "the bat cave".&amp;nbsp;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Plotz |first=David |url=http://slate.msn.com/id/2080099 |title=''The Slate field guide to Iraq Pundits'' |publisher=MSN |date=March 14, 2003 |accessdate=March 25, 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20050405213654/http://slate.msn.com/id/2080099/ |archivedate=April 5, 2005 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

He received the 1994 [[George Polk Award]] for "Best Television Documentary."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.brooklyn.liu.edu/polk/prev/prev90.html |title=George Polk Award |publisher=Brooklyn.liu.edu |accessdate=March 25, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Perez |first=Richard |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1995/03/07/nyregion/report-on-nicotine-levels-wins-polk-award.html |title=Perez-Pena, Richard, "Report on Nicotine Levels Wins Polk Award," ''The New York Times'', March 7, 1995.

A review of the book by ''[[The New York Times]]'s '' [[Ethan Bronner]], says that conservatives and some Jewish organizations took Emerson seriously, but that others have dismissed him as "an obsessive crusader", and concludes that  while Emerson sometimes connects unrelated dots,  occasionally he can be wrong;  but that as an investigator focusing on radical Islamic groups in the US, his information should be taken seriously but not just at face value.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Bronner|first1=Ethan|title=Suspect Thy Neighbor|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2002/03/17/books/suspect-thy-neighbor.html|work=The New York Times|accessdate=March 6, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While he has testified [[United States congressional committee|congressional committees]] on such topics including [[Al Qaeda]], [[Hamas]], [[Hezbollah]] and [[Islamic Jihad Organization|Islamic Jihad]], some of his more recent statements concerning Muslims in the US and Europe have been criticized for inaccuracies; in particular, some of his claims during a [[Fox News]] segment about the relationship between [[Islam in the United Kingdom|British Muslims]] and the city of [[Birmingham]] were subsequently rebuked by the then [[Prime Minister of the United Kingdom|British Prime Minister]] [[David Cameron]] and led to a censure of [[Fox News]] by [[Ofcom]] for the airing of the comments which the broadcasting regulator characterized as "materially misleading" and "a serious breach for a current affairs programme".&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/media/2015/sep/21/ofcom-criticises-fox-news-for-calling-birmingham-no-go-zone-for-non-muslims The Guardian]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Bio&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.steveemerson.com/about/ | work = Biography | publisher = Publicity.com | title = Steven Emerson | author = Steven Emerson | accessdate = January 23, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = Transcript&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.investigativeproject.org/4730/emerson-with-judge-pirro-no-go-islamic-zones | title=Emerson with Judge Pirro: No-Go Islamic Zones and Western Self-Denial | interviewer = Jenine Pirro |work=Interview on Fox News| publisher=Investigative Project on Terrorism | date=January 11, 2015 | accessdate=January 22, 2015 | author=Steven Emerson }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Guardian.Fox&gt;{{cite web|title=How did Fox News' Birmingham blunder make it to air?

It was Emerson's 1994 documentary ''Jihad in America'' that first linked [[Sami Al-Arian]] to the [[Palestinian Islamic Jihad]] (PIJ).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.tampatrib.com/MGB4QU3F1ME.html |title=Silvestrini, Elaine, "Al-Arian To Be Deported", ''The Tampa Tribune'', April 15, 2006.

In 1995 CBS interviews, prior to any knowledge the [[Oklahoma City bombing|bombing of the Oklahoma City Federal Building]] was perpetrated by [[Timothy McVeigh]], Emerson said "Oklahoma City, I can tell you, is probably considered one of the largest centers of Islamic radical activity outside the Middle East",&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/media/shortcuts/2015/jan/12/steven-emerson-muslims-birmingham-error-fox-news Steven Emerson: the Fox news expert who thinks Birmingham is 'totally Muslim']; ''The Guardian''; January 12, 2015&lt;/ref&gt; and that the bombing "was done with the intent to inflict as many casualties as possible.

He said the initial reporting did not "tar the entire Muslim community", that he referred only to a fanatical minority in the Islamic community.  He acknowledged there were outbreaks of harassment which he referred to as unfortunate.  In response to claims that all Muslims were blamed Emerson said "the charge of racism against Muslims is a canard designed to justify radical Islamic activities in this country."  He supported the media's decision to report the possible link to Middle East terrorism, saying "There was no doubt" that the FBI and other law enforcement agencies suspected it.&lt;ref name="AJR"&gt;{{cite web|last=Bender |first=Penny |url=http://www.ajr.org/Article.asp?id=1980 |title=Penny Bender Fuchs, American Journalism Review '&amp;#39;Jumping to Conclusions in Oklahoma City?'&amp;#39; June 1995 |publisher=Ajr.org |accessdate=April 30, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In testimony on March 19, 1996, to the [[Senate Foreign Relations Committee]], Emerson described the [[Holy Land Foundation]] as "the main fund-raising arm for Hamas in the United States."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nysun.com/editorials/defending-judith-miller-ii/2477/|title=Defending Judith Miller, II|publisher=nysun.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2007, federal prosecutors brought charges against Holy Land for funding [[Hamas]] and other Islamic terrorist organizations. In 2009, the founders of Holy Land were given [[life sentence]]s for "funneling $12 million to Hamas."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://jta.org/news/article/2009/05/28/1005480/holy-land-founders-get-life-sentences#When:10:32:00Z|title=Holy Land founders get life sentences|work=Jewish Telegraphic Agency}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In early 1997, Emerson told the ''[[Middle East Quarterly]]'' that the threat of terrorism "is greater now than before the World Trade Center bombing [in 1993] as the numbers of these groups and their members expands. In fact, I would say that the infrastructure now exists to carry off twenty simultaneous World Trade Center-type bombings across the United States."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nationalreview.com/comment/comment-pipes091101.shtml Pipes, Daniel, "U.S. Failure; The tactical blame falls on the U.S. government,"] ''[[National Review]]'', September 11, 2001. Retrieved January 28, 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

On February 24, 1998, Emerson testified before the [[Senate Judiciary Committee]]: "The foreign terrorist threat in the United States is one of the most important issues we face.... We now face distinct possibilities of mass civilian murder the likes of which have not been seen since World War II."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Bco44op7ArEC&amp;pg=PA100 |title=''Let Freedom Ring: Winning the War of Liberty Over Liberalism'', Sean Hannity, HarperCollins, 2004, ISBN 0-06-073565-1, accessed January 29, 2010 |publisher=Books.google.com |date= |accessdate=March 25, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; And just a few months before 9/11, he wrote on May 31, 2001: "Al-Qaeda is ... planning new attacks on the US.... [It has] learned, for example, how to destroy large buildings.... Al-Qaeda and other terrorist groups ... have silently declared war on the US; in turn, we must fight them as we would in a war."&lt;ref name="jewishworldreview2002"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jewishworldreview.com/jeff/jacoby020802.asp|title=Jeff Jacoby|publisher=jewishworldreview.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In January 2001 it was reported that Emerson pointed out that the U.S. had missed clues that would have allowed it to focus on al-Qaeda early on. One of the men convicted in the World Trade Center bombing, [[Ahmad Ajaj]], returned to the U.S. from Pakistan in 1992 with a bomb manual later seized by the U.S. An English translation of the document, entered into evidence in the World Trade Center trial, said that the manual was dated 1982, that it had been published in Amman, Jordan, and that it carried a heading on the front and succeeding pages: "The Basic Rule". But those were all errors, as Emerson pointed out. The heading said "al-Qaeda"&amp;nbsp;– which translates as "The Base". In addition, the document was published in 1989, a year after al-Qaeda was founded, and the place of publication was Afghanistan, not Jordan.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2001/01/14/world/holy-warriors-first-three-articles-network-terror-one-man-global-web-violence.html?pagewanted=7 |title=Holy Warriors; A Network of Terror; One Man and a Global Web of Violence," ''The New York Times'', January 14, 2001.

In 2010, ''The New York Times'' quoted Emerson criticizing the Obama administration's solicitation of Muslim and Arab-American organizations such as the [[Islamic Society of North America]], which was listed as an [[unindicted co-conspirator]] in a 2008 case against the [[Holy Land Foundation for Relief and Development]], whose leaders were convicted of funneling money to [[Hamas]], saying:  "I think dialogue is good, but it has to be with genuine moderates.

== Investigative Project on Terrorism ==

The Investigative Project on Terrorism was founded by Emerson in 1995, shortly after the release of his documentary film, ''[[Terrorists Among Us: Jihad in America]]'', which first aired in the United States in 1994 on PBS.&lt;ref name="about"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.investigativeproject.org/about.php | title=About The Investigative Project on Terrorism | publisher=IPT | accessdate=March 3, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="international"&gt;Ziegler, Andrew, [http://www.unc.edu/depts/diplomat/item/2008/0103/zieg/zeigler_seminar.html International Jihadists Infiltrating America?], ''[[American Diplomacy]]'', January 15, 2008. Retrieved April 1, 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;  The documentary was faulted for misrepresentation, and [[Robert I.

IPT maintains a data center which includes archival information relating to the past activities of known Islamic terrorist groups.  They also investigate suspected funding activities and networks of Islamic extremists in the US and abroad.  IPT obtains information from a variety of sources, including "websites, list-serves, publications, informants, undercover recordings, government records, court documents, and so on".  IPT has provided useful evidence to law enforcement and government agencies, and occasionally provides testimonial evidence during special committee hearings of the US Congress.&lt;ref name="about"/&gt;&lt;ref name=international/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Jeffrey H.

The [[Liberalism in the United States|liberal]] think-tank, [[Center for American Progress]] (CAP), stated that the IPT was one of ten foundations constituting what it called "the Islamophobia network in America".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Greg Barrett|title=The Gospel of Rutba: War, Peace, and the Good Samaritan Story in Iraq|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ZtAu9jwDTy0C&amp;pg=PA147|year=2012|publisher=Orbis Books|isbn=978-1-60833-113-0|page=147}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Emerson is also the founder and Executive Director of the Investigative Project on Terrorism, a large intelligence archive on Islamist groups around the world.&lt;ref name=ha /&gt; In 1995, he incorporated his company, SAE Productions, in Delaware, and also established his private think-tank, The Investigative Project, to conduct investigations into radical Islamist groups and terrorist activities.

In a television interview after the 1995 [[Oklahoma City bombing]], Emerson incorrectly pointed at Muslim terrorists, suggesting the bombing showed a Middle Eastern trait.&lt;ref name="FAIR"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://fair.org/extra-online-articles/Steven-Emersons-Crusade/ | title=Steven Emerson's Crusade | publisher=Fairness &amp; Accuracy in Reporting | date=January 1, 1999 | accessdate=January 28, 2015 | author=John F.

In March 2004, ''[[Newsweek]]'' ran an article detailing the high level of reliance [[Richard A. Clarke|Richard Clarke]], placed on Emerson's information, in lieu of that of the FBI. Clarke wrote  in his book ''Against All Enemies'' that Emerson's ''American Jihad'', "told me more than the FBI ever had about radical Islamic groups in the U.S."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.newsweek.com/id/148219 "Terror Watch: How Clarke 'Outsourced' Terror Intel; the Former Counterterrorism Chief Tapped a Private Researcher to Develop Intelligence on Al-Qaeda.

In April 2006, Emerson organized The Investigative Project on Terrorism Foundation as a nonprofit organization, and serves as its executive director.  In January 2007, the IRS granted the organization tax exempt status.  The organization's nonprofit status received a great deal of scrutiny from critics.  According to an article published in the Tennessean by Bob Smietana, allegations of ties between the newly organized charity, and Emerson's for-profit company, SAE, were brought to the attention of the IRS.&lt;ref name=Tennessean&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tennessean.com/article/20101024/NEWS01/10240374/The+price+of+fear|publisher=The Tennessean, a Gannet Co.|author=Bob Smietana|title=Anti-Muslim crusaders make millions spreading fear - 1 of 2 parts| date=October 24, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It was alleged that the foundation's tax free dollars were being funneled to Emerson's production company in violation of the law.  A spokesperson for Emerson's SAE Productions said the approach had already been vetted by the group's lawyers and declared legal, that it was set up that way for security reasons, and he further explained that Emerson does not take any profits from SAE Productions.  No formal charges were made, or disciplinary actions taken against Emerson. The foundation maintained its nonprofit status.&lt;ref name=Politico&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.politico.com/blogs/laurarozen/1010/Nonprofit_groups_ties_to_forprofit_entity_draws_scrutiny.html|title=Nonprofit group's ties to for-profit entity draw scrutiny | publisher=Politico | author=Laura Rozen | date=October 24, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to [[Deepa Kumar]] in her book ''Islamophobia and the Politics of Empire'', Emerson's Investigative Project on Terrorism, together with [[David Yerushalmi]]'s Society of Americans for National Existence, have forwarded the notion that there is a conspiracy by Muslims to take over the US, that Muslims have infiltrated its society, making no distinctions between Muslims and Islamists, and contend that Muslim Americans have ties to terrorist organizations and want to institute [[Sharia law]] in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Kumar|first1=Deepa|title=Islamophobia and the Politics of Empire|date=2013|publisher=Haymarket Books|isbn=1608462110|page=179|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=j7BMcQ4tLZAC&amp;pg=PA179}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In November 2016, the Project posted a 2010 speech given by U.S. Rep. [[Keith Ellison]], who is being considered to lead the [[Democratic National Committee]], in which he said that United States foreign policy in the Middle East "is governed by what is good or bad through a country of 7 million people.

===Indictments and trial evidence===

According to an article in the [[Middle East Forum]]'s  ''Middle East Quarterly'', "the IPT has access to information and intelligence to which the government is not privy, and has been instrumental in shutting down more than a dozen Islamic charitable terrorist and nonviolent front-groups since 2001."&lt;ref name=MEQ&gt;{{cite web|publisher=Middle East Quarterly|url=http://www.meforum.org/2578/steven-emerson-combating-radical-islam#_ftn26|title=Steven Emerson Combating Radical Islam|date=Winter 2010|accessdate=March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On December 2001, CBS: ''48 Hours'' - Erin Moriarity interviewed Steven Emerson, Executive Director of IPT, for the CBS television documentary series, ''48 Hours''. The episode, "Target Terrorism", was broadcast on January 30, 2002.

According to the ''Tampa Bay Times'', Arian signed a plea agreement in which he admitted to "conspiring to help people associated with Palestinian Islamic Jihad" and covering up his knowledge of the PIJ associations by lying to Jim Harper, a St. Petersburg reporter covering Al-Arian in the mid-1990s, and others.&lt;ref name=SPTimes&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sptimes.com/2006/04/23/Hillsborough/In_his_plea_deal_wha.shtml|work =Tampa Bay Times|title=In his plea deal, what did Sami Al-Arian admit to?|date=April 23, 2006|accessdate=March 22, 2014}} {{Dead link|date=September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reception==
Emerson has been referred to by ''[[The New York Times]]'' as "an expert on intelligence",&lt;ref name="The New York Times"/&gt; and a "self-described terrorism expert",&lt;ref name="nytimes.com"/&gt;  and by the ''[[New York Post]]'' as "the nation's foremost journalistic expert on terrorism"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.thecrimson.com/article/1999/10/22/extremism-and-its-apologists-pthis-past/ |last=Oppenheim |first=Noah |title=Extremism and Its Apologists |work=[[Harvard Crimson]] |date=October 22, 1999 |accessdate=January 29, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The ''Los Angeles Times'' referred to Emerson as a terrorism expert,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Neuman|first=Johanna|title=Obama criticized for associating with Ingrid Mattson|url=http://articles.latimes.com/2009/jan/25/nation/na-ticket25|newspaper=Los Angeles Times|date=January 25, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; and as a [[Fox News]] commentator.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Birmingham, England, a 'no-go zone'?

[[Richard A. Clarke|Richard Clarke]], former head of counter-terrorism for the [[United States National Security Council]], said of Emerson, "I think of Steve as the [[Paul Revere]] of terrorism ... We'd always learn things [from him] we weren’t hearing from the [[FBI]] or [[CIA]], things which almost always proved to be true."&lt;ref name=Brown/&gt;

[[Philip Jenkins]], in his 2003 book, ''Images of terror: what we can and can't know about terrorism'' responded that certain groups criticize Emerson in order to silence and delegitimize his views.&lt;ref name="Jenkins"&gt;{{cite book |title=Images of terror: what we can and can't know about terrorism |page=60 |author=Philip Jenkins |isbn=0-202-30679-8 |year=2003 |publisher=Aldine De Gruyter |location=NY}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A review by [[Michael Wines]] in ''The New York Times'' of ''The Fall of Pan Am 103,'' while noting that the authors were "respected journalists" and "not to be lightly dismissed," and that they "talked to 250 people, including senior law enforcement and intelligence officials in seven nations", opined that charges of Iranian complicity were presented "without much substantiation" although Wines did go on to say that: "They build a convincing circumstantial case against Iran and its terrorist agents."&lt;ref name="nytimes_1990-04-29"/&gt;

[[Adrienne Edgar]], writing in ''[[The New York Times Book Review]]'' described Emerson and Cristina del Sesto's 1991 book ''Terrorist'',  as "marred by factual errors (such as mistranslations of Arabic names) and marked by "a pervasive anti-Arab and anti-Palestinian bias."&lt;ref name="Defectors Story"&gt;{{cite news  |title=A Defector's Story  |work=[[The New York Times]] |author =  Adrienne Edgar | date= May 19, 1991}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Emerson and del Sesto responded:  "We defy anyone to point to any passages that suggest such bias.... these characterizations of the book are wild figments of Ms. Edgar's political imagination."&lt;ref name="Defectors Story Letter"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1991/06/16/books/l-a-defector-s-story-900091.html?scp=3&amp;sq=Terrorist+Emerson+Sesto&amp;st=nyt |title=A Defector's Story&amp;nbsp;– Letter  |work=[[The New York Times]] |author =  Steven Emerson, Cristina Del Sesto | date= June 16, 1991}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In their report "Fear, Inc.: The Roots of the Islamophobia Network in America", the [[Center for American Progress]] accused Emerson of being an "misinformation expert" who, through his testimonies, exaggerates the presence of Sharia law in America and terrorism sympathizers in mosques.&lt;ref name="Fear, Inc."&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.americanprogress.org/issues/religion/report/2011/08/26/10165/fear-inc/ |title=Fear, Inc.: The Roots of the Islamophobia Network in America |publisher=[[Center for American Progress]] |date=August 26, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Emerson has been criticized for espousing [[Islamophobia|Islamophobic]] views by Islamic studies sholars such as Juliane Hamer and Omid Safi, with German media scholar [[:de:Kai Hafez|Kai Hafez]], and [[Carl W.

==Controversies==

===Sami al-Arian case===

===Boston Marathon Bombing===
On April 17, 2013, Emerson stated on the Fox News program ''[[Hannity]]'' that he had been informed by an official in the [[US Immigration and Customs Enforcement]] (ICE) that a Saudi national who was present during the [[Boston Marathon bombing]] was suspected of playing a role in the bombing. Emerson wondered why a suspect would be deported and not prosecuted. Emerson reasoned that United States handles Saudi nationals differently to appease Saudi Arabia and not to embarrass the country.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://foxnewsinsider.com/2013/04/18/terrorism-expert-saudi-national-questioned-boston-bombings-being-deported-national|title=Saudi Man Cleared in Boston Bombing Now Being Deported?!|author=Hannity|work=Fox News Insider}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[US Department of Homeland Security|Homeland Security]] Secretary Janet Napolitano, whose department supervises the ICE, dismissed Emerson's allegation during a meeting with the House Homeland Security Committee, as being incorrect.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.salon.com/2013/04/18/gop_rep_embraces_boston_conspiracy_thoery//singleton/ GOP Rep embraces Boston conspiracy theory], ''[[Salon (website)|Salon]]'', Alex Seitz-Wald, April 18, 2013.

===Comments on Fox News about Birmingham, United Kingdom and Paris, France===
In January 2015, following [[Charlie Hebdo shooting|terrorist attacks in Paris, France]], Emerson stated in an interview on Fox News that the city of [[Birmingham]] was populated entirely by Muslims and was a "[[no go area]]" for non-Muslims.&lt;ref name=berror /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.investigativeproject.org/4730/emerson-with-judge-pirro-no-go-islamic-zones|title=Emerson with Judge Pirro: No-Go Islamic Zones and Western Self-Denial|author=Steven Emerson|work=The Investigative Project on Terrorism}}&lt;/ref&gt;  According to an estimate from the UK Census of 2011, Birmingham is estimated to have 21.8% of its population identify as Muslim, with a Christian population of 46%, and 25% claiming no religion or not giving a religion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-england-30773297 | title=Apology for 'Muslim Birmingham' Fox News claim | publisher=BBC | date=January 15, 2015 | accessdate=March 2, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the same interview, he claimed that in London, "Muslim religious police 'beat' anyone who doesn't dress according to Muslim, religious Muslim attire".&lt;ref name="BBC-20150112"&gt;{{cite news|title=Apology for 'Muslim-only Birmingham'|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-30773297|publisher=BBC News|date=January 12, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The errors led to four apologies within 12 hours by Fox News.&lt;ref name=berror&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-397944832.html | title=Fox News Network Apologises for String of On-Air Gaffes | publisher=Cape Times|location=South Africa | date=January 20, 2015 | accessdate=January 22, 2015 | author=Walker, Tim}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The UK media regulatory authority [[Ofcom]] found Fox News to be in breach of the UK's broadcasting code on account of the comments. Ofcom described the comments as "materially misleading" and "a serious breach".&lt;ref&gt;Alexander Seamer, [https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/home-news/fox-news-birmingham-is-a-nogo-zone-for-nonmuslims-comment-found-in-violation-of-broadcasting-code-10510953.html "Fox News 'Birmingham is no-go zone for non-Muslims' comment found in breach of broadcasting code"], ''The Independent], September 21, 2015&lt;/ref&gt;

In response to these comments, [[Prime Minister of the United Kingdom|British Prime Minister]] [[David Cameron]] said that he "choked on his [[porridge]]" when he heard them and observed that Emerson was "clearly a complete idiot".&lt;ref name="telegraph-20150112"/&gt;&lt;ref name="ITV-20150112"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.itv.com/news/central/update/2015-01-12/prime-minister-steven-emerson-is-clearly-an-idiot/|title=Prime Minister: Steven Emerson is "clearly an idiot"|publisher=itv.com|accessdate=January 12, 2015|date=January 12, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Local [[member of parliament|MP]] [[Gisela Stuart]] described Emerson's remarks as "stupid" and that they had "no redeeming features".&lt;ref name="BBC-20150112" /&gt;&lt;ref name="BBC"&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-england-30773297 | title=Apology for 'Muslim Birmingham' Fox News claim | work=UK News Birmingham and Black Country | publisher=BBC News | date=January 12, 2015 | accessdate=January 12, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Emerson's remarks, which "embarrassed" Fox, extended to other countries, especially regarding supposed exclusion zones in Paris.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/erik-wemple/wp/2015/01/18/fox-news-corrects-apologizes-for-no-go-zone-remarks/ Fox News corrects, apologizes for No Go Zone remarks], ''[[The Washington Post]]'', Eric Wemple, January 18, 2015.

Emerson issued an apology for his misinformation stating, "I have clearly made a terrible error for which I am deeply sorry. My comments about Birmingham were totally in error." He further added that he would make a donation to a charity in Birmingham and also place a newspaper ad in Birmingham.&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/northamerica/usa/11338985/Fox-News-terror-expert-says-everyone-in-Birmingham-is-a-Muslim.html |title=Fox News 'terror expert' says everyone in Birmingham is a Muslim |last1=Sanchez |first1=Raf |date=January 11, 2015 |work=The Daily Telegraph |accessdate=January 11, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It was also reported that [[Birmingham City Council]] welcomed his apology, describing Emerson's comments as "curious" and clearly without foundation.&lt;ref name="BBC-20150112" /&gt; [[Sir Albert Bore]], the leader of the council mocked Emerson writing "As I arrived for work at the Council House this morning I was full of awe and admiration for the many commuters who braved the 'no-go area' that is now Birmingham city centre" and described Emerson's remarks as "stupid, untrue and damaging...ridiculous".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/sir-albert-bore/fox-news-birmingham_b_6469024.html ''The Huffington Post'']&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Formal languages.svg|thumb|300px|right|This diagram shows the [[Syntax (logic)|syntactic entities]] that may be constructed from [[formal language]]s. The symbols and [[string (computer science)|strings of symbols]] may be broadly divided into [[nonsense]] and well-formed formulas. A formal language can be thought of as identical to the set of its well-formed formulas. The set of well-formed formulas may be broadly divided into [[theorem]]s and non-theorems.]]
A '''logical symbol''' is a fundamental [[concept]] in [[logic]], [[type–token distinction|token]]s of which may be marks or a configuration of marks which form a particular pattern.{{citation needed|date=November 2012}} Although the term "symbol" in common use refers at some times to the idea being symbolized, and at other times to the marks on a piece of paper or chalkboard which are being used to express that idea; in the [[formal language]]s studied in [[mathematics]] and [[logic]], the term "symbol" refers to the idea, and the marks are considered to be a [[type-token distinction|token]] instance of the symbol.{{dubious|date=November 2012}} In logic, symbols build literal utility to illustrate ideas.

==Overview==
Symbols of a formal language need not be symbols ''of'' anything. For instance there are [[logical constant]]s which do not refer to any idea, but  rather serve as a form of punctuation in the language (e.g. parentheses). Symbols of a formal language must be capable of being specified without any reference to any [[interpretation (logic)|interpretation]] of them.

A symbol or [[string (computer science)|string]] of symbols may comprise a [[well-formed formula]] if it is consistent with the [[formation rule]]s of the language.

In a [[formal system]] a symbol may be used as a token in formal operations.   The set of formal symbols in a [[formal language]] is referred to as an alphabet (hence each symbol may be referred to as a "letter")&lt;ref&gt;[[John Hopcroft]], [[Rajeev Motwani]] and [[Jeffrey Ullman]], [[Introduction to Automata Theory, Languages, and Computation]], 2000&lt;/ref&gt;{{Page needed|date=October 2010}}

A formal symbol as used in [[first-order logic]] may be a variable (member from a [[universe of discourse]]), a constant, a function (mapping to another member of universe) or a [[Predicate (mathematical logic)|predicate]] (mapping to T/F).

Formal symbols are usually thought of as purely [[Syntax (logic)|syntactic]] structures, composed into larger structures using a [[formal grammar]], though sometimes they may be associated with an interpretation or model (a [[Formal semantics (logic)|formal semantics]]).

==Can words be modeled as formal symbols?==

The move to view units in natural language (e.g. English)  as formal symbols was initiated by [[Noam Chomsky]] (it was this work that resulted in the [[Chomsky hierarchy]] in formal languages).  The [[generative grammar]] model looked upon syntax as autonomous from semantics.  Building on these models, the logician [[Richard Montague]] proposed that semantics could also be constructed on top of the formal structure:
:There is in my opinion no important theoretical difference between natural languages and the artificial languages of logicians; indeed, I consider it possible to comprehend the syntax and semantics of both kinds of language within a single natural and mathematically precise theory. On this point I differ from a number of philosophers, but agree, I believe, with Chomsky and his associates." &lt;ref&gt;Richard Montague, ''Universal Grammar'', '''1970'''&lt;/ref&gt;{{Page needed|date=October 2010}}
This is the philosophical premise underlying [[Montague grammar]].

However, this attempt to equate linguistic symbols with formal symbols has been challenged widely, particularly in the tradition of [[cognitive linguistics]], by philosophers like [[Stevan Harnad]], and linguists like [[George Lakoff]] and [[Ronald Langacker]].

'''''The Third Culture: Beyond the Scientific Revolution''''' is a 1995 book by [[John Brockman (literary agent)|John Brockman]] which discusses the work of several well-known scientists who are directly communicating their new, sometimes provocative, ideas to the general public. John Brockman has continued the themes of 'The Third Culture' in the website of the [[Edge Foundation, Inc.|Edge Foundation]], where leading scientists and thinkers contribute their thoughts in plain English.

The title of the book refers to [[Charles Percy Snow]]'s 1959 work ''[[The Two Cultures and the Scientific Revolution]]'', which described the conflict between the cultures of the [[humanities]] and [[science]].

== Contents ==
23 people were included in the 1995 book:
* physicist [[Paul Davies]]
* biologist [[Richard Dawkins]] 
* philosopher [[Daniel Dennett]]
* paleontologist [[Niles Eldredge]]
* chaos theorist [[J. Doyne Farmer]]
* theoretical physicist [[Murray Gell-Mann]]
* biologist [[Brian Goodwin]]
* geologist/biologist [[Stephen Jay Gould]]
* physicist [[Alan Guth]]
* inventor [[W. Daniel Hillis]]
* theoretical psychologist [[Nicholas Humphrey]]
* geneticist [[Steve Jones (biologist)|Steve Jones]]
* biologist [[Stuart Kauffman]]
* complex systems specialist [[Christopher Langton]]
* biologist [[Lynn Margulis]]
* mathematician and computer scientist [[Marvin Minsky]]
* mathematical physicist [[Roger Penrose]]
* cognitive scientist [[Steven Pinker]]
* theoretical astrophysicist [[Martin Rees]]
* cognitive scientist [[Roger Schank]]
* theoretical physicist [[Lee Smolin]]
* biologist [[Francisco Varela]]
* evolutionary biologist [[George C. Williams (biologist)|George C. Williams]]

The book influenced the reception of popular scientific literature in parts of the world beyond the United States. In Germany, the book inspired several newspapers to integrate scientific reports into their "[[Feuilleton]]" or "culture" sections (such as the ''[[Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung]]''). At the same time, the assertions of the book were discussed as a source of controversy, especially the implicit assertion that "third culture thinking" is mainly an American development. Critics acknowledge that, whereas in the Anglo-Saxon cultures there is a large tradition of scientists writing popular books, such tradition was absent for a long period in the German and French languages, with journalists often filling the gap. However, some decades ago there were also scientists, like the physicists [[Werner Heisenberg|Heisenberg]] and [[Schrödinger]] and the psychologist [[Jean Piaget|Piaget]], who fulfill the criteria Brockman named for "third culture." The German author [[Gabor Paal]] suggested that the idea of the "third culture" is a rather modern version of what [[Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel|Hegel]] called [[Realphilosophie]] (''philosophy of the real'').

Also, already during the [[interwar period]], [[Otto Neurath]] and other members of the [[Vienna Circle]] strongly propagated the need for both the [[unity of science]] and the popularization of new scientific concepts. With the rise of the Nazis in Germany and Austria, many of the Vienna Circle's members left for the United States where they taught in several universities, causing their philosophical ideas to spread in the Anglo-Saxon world throughout the 1930s-1940s.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4025">Cognitive anthropologist [[Pascal Boyer]] argued that minimally [[counterintuitive]] concepts (MCI) i.e., concepts that violate a few ontological expectations of a category such as the category of an agent, are more memorable than intuitive and maximally counterintuitive (MXCI) concepts.&lt;ref&gt;Boyer, Pascal. ''The Naturalness of Religious Ideas'' University of California Press, 1994.&lt;/ref&gt; A number of experimental psychology studies have found support for Boyer's hypothesis.  Upal &lt;ref&gt;Upal, M. A. (2010). "An Alternative View of the Minimal Counterintuitiveness Effect", ''Journal of Cognitive Systems Research'', 11(2), 194-203.&lt;/ref&gt; labelled this as the minimal counterintuitiveness effect or the MCI-effect.

Boyer originally did not precisely specify the number of expectation-violations that would render an idea maximally counterintuitive.  Early empirical studies including those by Boyer himself &lt;ref&gt;Boyer, P., &amp; Ramble, C. (2001). "Cognitive templates for religious concepts". ''Cognitive Science'', 25, 535–564.&lt;/ref&gt; and others &lt;ref&gt;Barrett, J. L., &amp; Nyhof, M. (2001). "Spreading non-natural concepts: the role of intuitive conceptual structures in memory and transmission of cultural materials". Journal of Cognition and Culture, 1, 69–100.&lt;/ref&gt; did not study MXCI concepts.  Both these studies only used concepts violating a single expectation (which were labelled as MCI concepts).  Atran &lt;ref&gt;Atran, S. (2002). "In gods we trust: The evolutionary landscape of religion", Oxford, NY: Oxford University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; was the first to study memory for MXCI concepts and labeled concepts violating 2-expectations as maximally counterintuitive.  Studies by the I-75 Cognition and Culture Group &lt;ref&gt;Upal, M. A. (2005). "Role of context in memorability of intuitive and counterintuitive concepts". In B. Bara, L. Barsalou, &amp; M. Bucciarelli (Eds.), ''Proceedings of the 27th annual conference of the cognitive science society'', (pp. 2224–2229). Mahwah, NJ: Lawrence Earlbaum.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Gonce, L., Upal, M., Slone, J., &amp; Tweney, R. (2006). "The role of context in the recall of counterintuitive concepts". ''Journal of Cognition and Culture'', 6(3–4), 521–547.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Tweney, R. D., Upal, M. A., Gonce, L., Slone, D. J., &amp; Edwards, K. (2006). "The creative structuring of counterintuitive worlds". ''Journal of Cognition and Culture'', 6, 483–498.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Upal, M. A., Gonce, L., Tweney, R., et al. (2007). Contextualizing counterintuitiveness: How context affects comprehension and memorability of counterintuitive concepts. Cognitive Science, 31(3), 415–439.&lt;/ref&gt;  also labelled ideas violating two expectations as maximally counterintuitive.  Barrett &lt;ref&gt;Barrett, J. L. (2008). "Coding and quantifying counterintuitiveness in religious concepts: Theoretical and methodological reflections". ''Method and Theory in the Study of Religion'', 20, 308–338.&lt;/ref&gt; argued that ideas violating 1 or 2 ontological expectations should be considered MCI and only ideas violating 3 or more expectations should be labelled MXCI.  Subsequent studies &lt;ref&gt;Harmon-Vukic, M., Upal, M. A., &amp; Trainor, C. "Understanding the role of context in memory for maximally counterintuitive concepts", in ''Proceedings of the 35th Annual Meeting of the Cognitive Science Society''.&lt;/ref&gt; of the MCI effect have followed this revised labelling scheme.

Upal &lt;ref&gt;Upal, M. A. (2010). "An Alternative View of the Minimal Counterintuitiveness Effect", ''Journal of Cognitive Systems Research'', 11(2), 194-203.&lt;/ref&gt; has divided the cognitive accounts that explain the MCI effect into two categories: the [[Context-based model of minimal counterintuitiveness]], and content-based view of minimal counterintuitiveness.  The context-based view emphasizes the role played by context in making an idea counterintuitive whereas the content-based view ignores the role of context.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="24865">In [[geometry]], the '''Weber problem''', named after [[Alfred Weber]], is one of the most famous problems in [[location theory]]. It requires finding a point in the plane that minimizes the sum of the transportation costs from this point to ''n'' destination points, where different destination points are associated with different costs per unit distance.

The Weber problem generalizes the [[geometric median]], which assumes transportation costs per unit distance are the same for all destination points, and the problem of computing the [[Fermat point]], the geometric median of three points. For this reason it is sometimes called the Fermat–Weber problem, although the same name has also been used for the unweighted geometric median problem. The Weber problem is in turn generalized by the [[attraction–repulsion problem]], which allows some of the costs to be negative, so that greater distance from some points is better.

In the triangle case, the Fermat problem consists in locating a point D with respect to three points A, B, and C in such a way that the sum of the distances between D and each of the three other points is minimized. It was formulated by the famous French mathematician [[Pierre de Fermat]] before 1640, and it can be seen as the true beginning of both location theory, and space-economy. Torricelli found a geometrical solution to this problem around 1645, but it still had no direct numerical solution more than 325 years later. Kuhn and Kuenne&lt;ref&gt;Kuhn, Harold W. and Robert E. Kuenne, 1962, "An Efficient Algorithm for the Numerical Solution of the Generalized Weber Problem in Spatial Economics." ''Journal of Regional Science'' 4, 21–34.&lt;/ref&gt; found an iterative solution for the general Fermat problem in 1962, and, in 1972, [[Luc-Normand Tellier|Tellier]]&lt;ref&gt;Tellier, Luc-Normand, 1972, “The Weber Problem: Solution and Interpretation”, ''Geographical Analysis'', vol. 4, no. 3, pp. 215–233.&lt;/ref&gt;  found a direct numerical solution to the Fermat triangle problem, which is trigonometric. Kuhn and Kuenne's solution applies to the case of polygons having more than three sides, which is not the case with Tellier's solution for reasons explained further on.

The Weber problem consists, in the triangle case, in locating a point D with respect to three points A, B, and C in such a way that the sum of the transportation costs between D and each of the three other points is minimized. The Weber problem is a generalization of the Fermat problem since it involves both equal and unequal attractive forces (see below), while the Fermat problem only deals with equal attractive forces. It was first formulated, and solved geometrically in the triangle case, by [[Thomas Simpson]] in 1750.&lt;ref&gt;Simpson, Thomas, 1750, ''The Doctrine and Application of Fluxions'', London.&lt;/ref&gt; It was later popularized by [[Alfred Weber]] in 1909.&lt;ref&gt;Weber, Alfred, 1909, ''Über den Standort der Industrien'', Tübingen, J.C.B. Mohr) — English translation: ''The Theory of the Location of Industries'', Chicago, Chicago University Press, 1929, 256 pages.&lt;/ref&gt; Kuhn and Kuenne's iterative solution found in 1962, and Tellier's solution found in 1972 apply to the Weber triangle problem as well as to the Fermat one. Kuhn and Kuenne's solution applies also to the case of polygons having more than three sides.

In its simplest version, the attraction-repulsion problem consists in locating a point D with respect to three points A&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, A&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and R in such a way that the attractive forces exerted by points A&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; and A&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, and the repulsive force exerted by point R cancel each other out as it must do at the optimum. It constitutes a generalization of both the Fermat and Weber problems. It was first formulated and solved, in the triangle case, in 1985 by [[Luc-Normand Tellier]].&lt;ref&gt;Tellier, Luc-Normand, 1985, ''Économie spatiale: rationalité économique de l'espace habité'', Chicoutimi, Gaëtan Morin éditeur, 280 pages.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1992, Chen, Hansen, Jaumard and Tuy found a solution to the Tellier problem for the case of polygons having more than three sides.

== Torricelli’s geometrical solution of the Fermat triangle problem ==
[[File:Figaa.jpg|thumb|alt=Torricelli's solution|right|upright=1.5| Torricelli's geometrical solution of the Fermat triangle problem.]]

[[Evangelista Torricelli]]’s geometrical solution of the Fermat triangle problem stems from two observations:

1– point D is at its optimal location when any significant move out of that location induces a net increase of the total distance to reference points A, B, and C, which means that the optimal point is the only point where an infinitesimal movement towards one of the three reference points induces a reduction of the distance to that point that is equal to the sum of the induced changes in the distances to the two other points; in fact, in the Fermat problem, the advantage to reduce the distance from A by one kilometer is equal to the advantage to reduce the distance from B by one kilometer or the distance from C by the same length; in other words, the activity to be located at D is equally attracted by A, B, and C;

2– according to an important theorem of Euclidean geometry, in a convex quadrilateral inscribed in a circle, the opposite angles are supplementary (that is their sum is equal to 180°); that theorem can also take the following form: if we cut a circle with a chord AB, we get two circle arcs, let us say AiB and AjB; on arc AiB, any ∠AiB angle is the same for any chosen point i, and, on arc AjB, all the ∠AjB angles are also equal for any chosen point j; moreover, the ∠AiB and ∠AjB angles are supplementary.

It can be proved that the first observation implies that, at the optimum, the angles between the AD, BD, and CD straight lines must be equal to 360° / 3 = 120°. Torricelli deduced from that conclusion that:

1– if any triangle ABD, whose ∠ADB angle is equal to 120°, generates an ABDE convex quadrilateral inscribed in a circle, the ∠ABE angle of the ABE triangle must be equal to (180°&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus;&amp;nbsp;120°)= 60°;

2– one way to determine the set of locations of D for which the ∠ADB angle is equal to 120° is to draw an equilateral ABE triangle (because each angle of an equilateral triangle is equal to 60°), where E is located outside the ABC triangle, and draw a circle round that triangle; then all the D’ points of the circumference of that circle that lie within the ABC circle are such that the ∠AD’B angle is equal to 120°;

3– the same reasoning can be made with respect to triangles ACD, and BCD;

4– this leads to draw two other equilateral triangles ACF and BCG, where F and G are located outside the ABC triangle, as well as two other circles round these equilateral triangles, and to determine the location where the three circles intersect; at that location, the angles between the AD, BD, and CD straight lines is necessarily equal to 120°, which proves that it is the optimal location.

== Simpson’s geometrical solution of the Weber triangle problem ==
[[File:Figb.jpg|thumb|alt=Simpson's solution|right|upright=1.5| Simpson's geometrical solution of the Weber triangle problem.]]

Simpson's geometrical solution of the so-called “Weber triangle problem” (which was first formulated by [[Thomas Simpson]] in 1750) directly derives from Torricelli's solution. Simpson and Weber stressed the fact that, in a total transportation minimization problem, the advantage to get closer to each attraction point A, B or C depends on what is carried and on its transportation cost. Consequently, the advantage of getting one kilometer closer to A, B or C varies, and the ∠ADB, ∠ADC and ∠BDC angles no more need to be equal to 120°.

Simpson demonstrated that, in the same way as, in the Fermat triangle problem case, the constructed triangles ABE, ACF and BCG were equilateral because the three attractive forces were equal, in the Weber triangle problem case, the constructed triangles ABE, ACF and BCG, where E, F and G are located outside the ABC triangle, must be proportional to the attractive forces of the location system.

The solution is such that:

1– in the constructed triangle ABE, the AB side is proportional to the attractive force &lt;sub&gt;C&lt;/sub&gt;w pointing towards C, the AE side is proportional to the attractive force &lt;sub&gt;B&lt;/sub&gt;w pointing towards B, and the BE side is proportional to the attractive force &lt;sub&gt;A&lt;/sub&gt;w pointing towards A;

2– in the constructed triangle BCG, the BC side is proportional to the attractive force &lt;sub&gt;A&lt;/sub&gt;w pointing towards A, the BG side is proportional to the attractive force &lt;sub&gt;B&lt;/sub&gt;w pointing towards B, and the CG side is proportional to the attractive force &lt;sub&gt;C&lt;/sub&gt;w pointing towards C;

3– the optimal point D is located at the intersection of the two circumferences drawn round the ABE and BCG constructed triangles.

A third triangle of forces ACF, where F is located outside the ABC triangle, can be drawn based on the AC side, and a third circumference can be traced round that triangle. That third circumference crosses the two previous ones at the same point D.

== Tellier’s geometrical solution of the attraction-repulsion triangle problem ==
[[File:Figc.jpg|thumb|alt=Tellier's solution|right|upright=1.5| Tellier's geometrical solution of the attraction-repulsion triangle problem.]]

A geometrical solution exists for the attraction-repulsion triangle problem. Its discovery is rather recent.&lt;ref&gt;Tellier, Luc-Normand, 2013, « Annexe 1 : Solution géométrique du cas triangulaire du problème d’attraction-répulsion », annex of the paper of Pierre Hansen, Christophe Meyer and Luc-Normand Tellier, « Modèles topodynamique et de la Nouvelle économie géographique : compatibilité, convergence et avantages comparés », in Marc-Urbain Proulx (ed.), 2013, ''Sciences du territoire II : méthodologies'', Québec, Presses de l’Université du Québec.&lt;/ref&gt;  That geometrical solution differs from the two previous ones since, in this case, the two constructed force triangles overlap the A&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;A&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;R location triangle (where A&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; and A&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; are attraction points, and R, a repulsion one), while, in the preceding cases, they never did.

This solution is such that:

1– in the constructed triangle RA&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;H, which partly overlaps the A&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;A&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;R location triangle, the RA&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; side is proportional to the attractive force &lt;sub&gt;A1&lt;/sub&gt;w pointing towards A&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, the RH side is proportional to the attractive force &lt;sub&gt;A2&lt;/sub&gt;w pointing towards A&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, and the A&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;H side is proportional to the repulsive force &lt;sub&gt;R&lt;/sub&gt;w pushing away from point R;

2– in the constructed triangle RA&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;I, which partly overlaps the A&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;A&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;R location triangle, the RA&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; side is proportional to the attractive force &lt;sub&gt;A2&lt;/sub&gt;w pointing towards A&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, the RI side is proportional to the attractive force &lt;sub&gt;A1&lt;/sub&gt;w pointing towards A&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, and the A&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;I side is proportional to the repulsive force &lt;sub&gt;R&lt;/sub&gt;w pushing away from point R;

3– the optimal point D is located at the intersection of the two circumferences drawn round the RA&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;H and RA&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;I constructed triangles.
This solution is useless if one of the forces is greater than the sum of the two other ones or if the angles are not compatible. In some cases, no force is larger than the two other ones, and the angles are not compatible; then, the optimal location lies at the point that exerts the greater attractive force.

== Tellier’s trigonometric solution of the Fermat and Weber triangle problems ==
[[File:Figd.jpg|thumb|alt=The Weber problem|right|upright=1.1| The angles of the Weber problem.]]
[[File:Fige.jpg|thumb|alt=Non-coincidence of angles|right|upright=1.1| The case of non-coincidence of the vertices of the α angles.]]

More than 332 years separate the first formulation of the Fermat triangle problem and the discovery of its non-iterative numerical solution, while a geometrical solution existed for almost all that period of time. Is there an explanation for that? That explanation lies in the possibility of the origins of the three vectors oriented towards the three attraction points not coinciding. If those origins do coincide and lie at the optimum location P, the vectors oriented towards A, B and C, and the sides of the ABC location triangle form the six angles ∠1, ∠2, ∠3, ∠4, ∠5, and ∠6, and the three vectors form the ∠α&lt;sub&gt;A&lt;/sub&gt;, ∠α&lt;sub&gt;B&lt;/sub&gt; and ∠α&lt;sub&gt;C&lt;/sub&gt; angles. It is easy to write the following six equations linking six unknowns (the angles ∠1, ∠2, ∠3, ∠4, ∠5, and ∠6) with six known values (angles ∠A, ∠B, and ∠C, whose values are given, and angles ∠α&lt;sub&gt;A&lt;/sub&gt;, ∠α&lt;sub&gt;B&lt;/sub&gt; and ∠α&lt;sub&gt;C&lt;/sub&gt;, whose values depend only on the relative magnitude of the three attractive forces pointing towards the A, B and C attraction points):

: ∠1 + ∠2 = ∠C ;
: ∠3 + ∠4 = ∠A ;
: ∠5 + ∠6 = ∠B ;
: ∠1 + ∠6 + ∠α&lt;sub&gt;A&lt;/sub&gt; = 180° ;
: ∠2 + ∠3 + ∠α&lt;sub&gt;B&lt;/sub&gt; = 180° ;
: ∠4 + ∠5 + ∠α&lt;sub&gt;C&lt;/sub&gt; = 180°.

Unfortunately, this system of six simultaneous equations with six unknowns is undetermined, and the possibility of the origins of the three vectors oriented towards the three attraction points not coinciding explains why. In the case of non-coincidence, we observe that all the six equations are still valid. However, the optimal location P has disappeared because of the triangular hole that exists inside the triangle. In fact, as Tellier (1972)&lt;ref&gt;Tellier, Luc-Normand, 1972, “The Weber Problem: Solution and Interpretation”, ''Geographical Analysis'', vol. 4, no. 3, pp. 215–233.&lt;/ref&gt; has shown, that triangular hole had exactly the same proportions as the “forces triangles” we drew in Simpson's geometrical solution.

In order to solve the problem, we must add to the six simultaneous equations a seventh requirement, which states that there should be no triangular hole in the middle of the location triangle. In other words, the origins of the three vectors must coincide.

Tellier's solution of the Fermat and Weber triangle problems involves three steps:

1– Determine the angles ∠α&lt;sub&gt;A&lt;/sub&gt;, ∠α&lt;sub&gt;B&lt;/sub&gt; and ∠α&lt;sub&gt;C&lt;/sub&gt; that are such that the three attractives forces &lt;sub&gt;A&lt;/sub&gt;w, &lt;sub&gt;B&lt;/sub&gt;w and &lt;sub&gt;C&lt;/sub&gt;w cancel each other to ensure equilibrium. This is done by means of the following independent equations:

: cos ∠α&lt;sub&gt;A&lt;/sub&gt; = &amp;minus;( &lt;sub&gt;B&lt;/sub&gt;w&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; + &lt;sub&gt;C&lt;/sub&gt;w&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; &amp;minus; &lt;sub&gt;A&lt;/sub&gt;w&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;) / (2 &lt;sub&gt;B&lt;/sub&gt;w &lt;sub&gt;C&lt;/sub&gt;w)  ;
: cos ∠α&lt;sub&gt;B&lt;/sub&gt; = &amp;minus;( &lt;sub&gt;A&lt;/sub&gt;w&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; + &lt;sub&gt;C&lt;/sub&gt;w&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; &amp;minus; &lt;sub&gt;B&lt;/sub&gt;w&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;) / (2 &lt;sub&gt;A&lt;/sub&gt;w &lt;sub&gt;C&lt;/sub&gt;w)  ;
: cos ∠α&lt;sub&gt;C&lt;/sub&gt; = &amp;minus;( &lt;sub&gt;A&lt;/sub&gt;w&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; + &lt;sub&gt;B&lt;/sub&gt;w&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; &amp;minus; &lt;sub&gt;C&lt;/sub&gt;w&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;) / (2 &lt;sub&gt;A&lt;/sub&gt;w &lt;sub&gt;B&lt;/sub&gt;w)  ;

2– Determine the value of angle ∠3 (this equation derives from the requirement that point D must coincide with point E):

: tan ∠3 = (k sin k’) / (1 + k cos k’) ;

where k = (CB/CA) (sin ∠α&lt;sub&gt;B&lt;/sub&gt; / sin ∠α&lt;sub&gt;A&lt;/sub&gt;), and k’ = (∠A +∠B + ∠α&lt;sub&gt;C&lt;/sub&gt;) &amp;minus; 180° ;

3– Solve the following system of simultaneous equations where ∠3 is now known:

: ∠1 + ∠2 = ∠C ;
: ∠3 + ∠4 = ∠A ;
: ∠5 + ∠6 = ∠B ;
: ∠1 + ∠6 + ∠α&lt;sub&gt;A&lt;/sub&gt; = 180° ;
: ∠2 + ∠3 + ∠α&lt;sub&gt;B&lt;/sub&gt; = 180° ;
: ∠4 + ∠5 + ∠α&lt;sub&gt;C&lt;/sub&gt; = 180°.

[[File:Figg.jpg|thumb|alt= Non-coincidence of points D and E |right|upright=1.6| The case of non-coincidence of points D and E.]]

Tellier (1985)&lt;ref&gt;Tellier, Luc-Normand, 1985, ''Économie spatiale: rationalité économique de l'espace habité'', Chicoutimi, Gaëtan Morin éditeur, 280 pages.&lt;/ref&gt; extended the Fermat–Weber problem to the case of repulsive forces. Let us examine the triangle case where there are two attractive forces &lt;sub&gt;A1&lt;/sub&gt;w and &lt;sub&gt;A2&lt;/sub&gt;w, and one repulsive force &lt;sub&gt;R&lt;/sub&gt;w. Here as in the previous case, the possibility exists for the origins of the three vectors not to coincide. So the solution must require their coinciding. Tellier's trigonometric solution of this problem is the following:

1– Determine angle ∠e :

: cos ∠e = -( &lt;sub&gt;A1&lt;/sub&gt;w&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; + &lt;sub&gt;A2&lt;/sub&gt;w&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; &amp;minus; &lt;sub&gt;R&lt;/sub&gt;w&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;) / (2 &lt;sub&gt;A1&lt;/sub&gt;w &lt;sub&gt;A2&lt;/sub&gt;w)  ;

2– Determine angle ∠p :
: cos ∠p = -( &lt;sub&gt;A1&lt;/sub&gt;w&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; + &lt;sub&gt;R&lt;/sub&gt;w&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; &amp;minus; &lt;sub&gt;A2&lt;/sub&gt;w&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;) / (2 &lt;sub&gt;A1&lt;/sub&gt;w &lt;sub&gt;R&lt;/sub&gt;w)  ;

3– Determine angle ∠c :
: ∠c = 180° &amp;minus; ∠p ;

4– Determine angle ∠d :
: ∠d = ∠e &amp;minus; ∠c ;

5– Determine the value of angle ∠3 (this equation derives from the requirement that point D must coincide with point E):
: tan ∠3 = x / y ;
where	x = sin ∠f – (RA&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;/RA&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;)(sin ∠d sin [∠e &amp;minus; ∠b] / sin ∠c) ; 
and	y = (RA&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;/RA&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;)(sin ∠d cos [∠e &amp;minus; ∠b] / sin ∠c) &amp;minus; cos ∠f ;

6– Determine ∠1 :
: ∠1 = 180° &amp;minus; ∠e &amp;minus; ∠3 ;

7– Determine ∠5 :
: ∠5 = 180° &amp;minus; ∠b &amp;minus; ∠c &amp;minus; ∠1 ;

8– Determine ∠2 :
: ∠2 = ∠a &amp;minus; ∠5 .

== Iterative solutions of the Fermat, Weber and attraction-repulsion problems ==

When the number of forces is larger than three, it is no longer possible to determine the angles separating the various forces without taking into account the geometry of the location polygon. Geometric and trigonometric methods are then powerless. Iterative optimizing methods are used in such cases. Kuhn and Kuenne (1962)&lt;ref&gt;Kuhn, Harold W. and Robert E. Kuenne, 1962, "An Efficient Algorithm for the Numerical Solution of the Generalized Weber Problem in Spatial Economics." ''Journal of Regional Science'' 4, 21–34.&lt;/ref&gt; suggested an algorithm based on [[iteratively reweighted least squares]] generalizing [[Weiszfeld's algorithm]] for the [[geometric median|unweighted problem]]. Their method is valid for the Fermat and Weber problems involving many forces, but not for the attraction–repulsion problem. In this method, to find an approximation to the point ''y'' minimizing the weighted sum of distances
:&lt;math&gt;\sum_{i=1}^n w_i\, \|x_i-y\|,&lt;/math&gt;
an initial approximation to the solution ''y''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; is found, and then at each stage of the algorithm is moved closer to the optimal solution by setting ''y''&lt;sub&gt;''j''&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;1&lt;/sub&gt; to be the point minimizing the sum of weighted squared distances
:&lt;math&gt;\sum_{i=1}^n \frac{w_i}{\|x_i-y_j\|} \|x_i-y\|^2&lt;/math&gt;
where the initial weights ''w''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt; of the input points are divided by the distances from each point to the approximation from the previous stage.
As the unique optimal solution to a weighted least squares problem, each successive approximation may be found as a weighted average:
:&lt;math&gt;\left. y_{j+1}=\left( \sum_{i=1}^n \frac{w_ix_i}{\| x_i - y_j \|} \right) \right/ \left( \sum_{i=1}^n \frac{w_i}{\| x_i - y_j \|} \right).&lt;/math&gt;

For the attraction–repulsion problem one has instead to resort to the algorithm proposed by Chen, Hansen, Jaumard and Tuy (1992).&lt;ref&gt;Chen, Pey-Chun, Hansen, Pierre, Jaumard, Brigitte and Hoang Tuy, 1992, "Weber's Problem with Attraction and Repulsion," ''Journal of Regional Science'' 32, 467–486.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Interpretation of the land rent theory in the light of the attraction–repulsion problem ==

In the world of [[location theory|spatial economics]], repulsive forces are omnipresent. Land values are the main illustration of them. In fact a substantial portion of [[Bid rent theory|land value theory]], both rural and urban, can be summed up in the following way.

In the case where everybody is attracted by a single attraction point (the rural market or the urban central business district), competition between the various bidders who all want to locate at the center will generate land values that will transform the unique attraction point of the system into a repulsion point from the land value point of view, and, at the equilibrium, each inhabitant and activity will be located at the point where the attractive and the repulsive forces exerted by the center on them will cancel out.

== The attraction–repulsion problem and the New Economic Geography ==

The Tellier problem preceded the emergence of the [[Economic geography#New economic geography|New Economic Geography]]. It is seen by Ottaviano and Thisse (2005)&lt;ref&gt;Ottaviano, Gianmarco and Jacques-François Thisse, 2005, « New Economic Geography: what about the N? », ''Environment and Planning A'' 37, 1707–1725.&lt;/ref&gt; as a prelude to the New Economic Geography (NEG) that developed in the 1990s, and earned [[Paul Krugman]] a [[Nobel Memorial Prize]] in Economic Sciences in 2008. The concept of attractive force is akin to the NEG concept of agglomeration or centripetal force, and the concept of repulsive force is akin to the NEG concept of dispersal or centrifugal force.

Belkaid's research group is working to understand the mechanisms underlying host-microbe interactions in the [[gastrointestinal tract]] and on the [[skin]], which are natural barrier sites between the host's inner workings and their external environment.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://irp.nih.gov/our-research/research-in-action/the-microbiome-when-good-bugs-go-bad|title=The Microbiome: When Good Bugs Go Bad|date=2014-05-20|work=NIH Intramural Research Program|access-date=2018-07-25|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; More specifically, Belkaid's team is investigating the role microbiota play in promoting immunity against infection against other harmful [[pathogen]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Belkaid|first=Yasmine|last2=Hand|first2=Timothy W.|date=March 2014|title=Role of the Microbiota in Immunity and Inflammation|journal=Cell|volume=157|issue=1|pages=121–141|doi=10.1016/j.cell.2014.03.011|issn=0092-8674|pmc=4056765|pmid=24679531|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; While microbes are often thought of as harmful infectious agents, her work has contributed to our understanding of the role that [[microbiota]] play in immunity—a beneficial relationship known as [[commensalism]] whereby the host actually benefits from the microorganisms that live on or in them.

They then infected the colonized and bacteria-free mice with a parasite and found that those without the "good" bacteria were unable to fight back against the parasite, while those with the bacteria mounted an effective immune response.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Her team has also found that beneficial bacteria living on the surface of the skin can also accelerate wound healing in mice.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Linehan|first=Jonathan L.|last2=Harrison|first2=Oliver J.|last3=Han|first3=Seong-Ji|last4=Byrd|first4=Allyson L.|last5=Vujkovic-Cvijin|first5=Ivan|last6=Villarino|first6=Alejandro V.|last7=Sen|first7=Shurjo K.|last8=Shaik|first8=Jahangheer|last9=Smelkinson|first9=Margery|date=February 2018|title=Non-classical Immunity Controls Microbiota Impact on Skin Immunity and Tissue Repair|url=https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0092867417315131|journal=Cell|volume=172|issue=4|pages=784–796.e18|doi=10.1016/j.cell.2017.12.033|issn=0092-8674|pmc=6034182|pmid=29358051|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Belkaid's group also studies what happens when there are imbalances in our microbiome. A number of diseases are caused by our immune systems running out of whack. Given the roll the microbiome plays in host immunity, Belkaid has played a major part in advancing our understanding of how shifts in microbiota can contribute to disease, particularly chronic inflammatory diseases like [[Crohn's disease]] and [[Psoriasis]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Hand|first=Timothy W.|last2=Vujkovic-Cvijin|first2=Ivan|last3=Ridaura|first3=Vanessa K.|last4=Belkaid|first4=Yasmine|date=December 2016|title=Linking the Microbiota, Chronic Disease, and the Immune System|journal=Trends in Endocrinology and Metabolism |volume=27|issue=12|pages=831–843|doi=10.1016/j.tem.2016.08.003|issn=1879-3061|pmc=5116263|pmid=27623245|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Man|first=Si Ming|last2=Kaakoush|first2=Nadeem O.|last3=Mitchell|first3=Hazel M.|date=March 2011|title=The role of bacteria and pattern-recognition receptors in Crohn's disease|journal=Nature Reviews.
