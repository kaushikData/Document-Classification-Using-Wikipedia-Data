The '''1984 Soviet Union tornado outbreak''', also known as the '''1984 Ivanovo tornado outbreak''', was one of only three disastrous [[tornado]] [[tornado outbreak|outbreaks]] in modern [[Russia]]n [[History of the Soviet Union (1982–1991)|history]] (one of the others being the [[1904 Moscow tornado]]) and the [[List of European tornadoes and tornado outbreaks#20th century|third-deadliest tornado outbreak]] in European history. Occurring on June&amp;nbsp;9, 1984, the outbreak struck the [[Ivanovo]] and [[Yaroslavl]] regions north of [[Moscow]], an area over 400,000&amp;nbsp;km&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;. At least two of the eleven known tornadoes were [[Fujita scale#Rating classifications|violent events]], equal to F4 or F5 in intensity on the Fujita scale, based upon observed damages. The deadliest single tornado was posthumously rated at F5 intensity and killed at least 92 people along its long path near Ivanovo and other towns. The tornado, up to {{convert|800|m|mi|lk=on}} wide, caused extreme damage, reportedly annihilating steel-reinforced concrete structures and throwing heavy objects of {{convert|320000|kg|lb|lk=on}} for distances up to {{convert|200|m|mi|lk=on}}. Another tornado, assessed to have been at least F4 and possibly F5 in intensity, occurred at Kostroma. Severe [[thunderstorm]]s also produced [[hail]] up to {{convert|1|kg|lb|lk=on}} in weight, among the heaviest hailstones confirmed worldwide. In all, the entire tornado outbreak killed at least 400&amp;nbsp;people and injured 213.{{Citation needed|date=July 2017}}

==Meteorological synopsis==
On June&amp;nbsp;8, 1984, a negatively tilted [[trough (meteorology)|trough]] caused an [[extratropical cyclone|extratropical]] [[low pressure area]] to form over the coast of the [[Communist Romania|Socialist Republic of Romania]] (now non-Communist [[Romania]]). Surface moisture moved north from the [[Black Sea]] and caused nearby [[dew point]]s to rise to {{convert|20|C|F|lk=on}}; though at that time these were restricted to Romania and the [[Ukrainian Soviet Socialist Republic|Ukrainian SSR]], dew points were higher than average elsewhere.&lt;ref name=Finch1&gt;{{cite journal|last=Finch|first=J.|author2=D. Bikos|title=Russian tornado outbreak of 9 June 1984|journal=Electronic Journal of Severe Storms Meteorology|year=2012|volume=7|issue=4|pages=1–28|url=http://www.ejssm.org/ojs/index.php/ejssm/article/view/98/82}}&lt;/ref&gt; By 1800 [[Coordinated Universal Time|UTC]], developing thunderstorms over the Ukrainian SSR spread overnight into the [[Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic|Russian SFSR]]. Between 00 and 12 UTC on June&amp;nbsp;9, the strengthening low pressure area moved north-northeast over the northwestern Russian SFSR before undergoing [[Occluded front|occlusion]]. In the meantime, a strong [[cold front]] rapidly advanced along a line extending south from the surface low, then south of [[Minsk]] in the [[Byelorussian Soviet Socialist Republic|Byelorussian SSR]] (now [[Belarus]]), to near [[Bucharest]]. This front separated the drier air mass to the north from the warm, moist air mass near the Black Sea, and strong wind speeds near ground level caused [[Mixed layer#Atmospheric mixed layer formation|vertical mixing]]. Therefore, dew points actually dropped before the first tornadoes formed, but nevertheless several factors overcame the lower dew points to produce tornadoes. Among these were a strong upper-level [[jet stream]], clear skies causing [[convective available potential energy#Example from meteorology|daytime heating]] and instability, strong [[Synoptic scale meteorology|synoptic-scale]] [[Momentum|lifting leading]] to ascension of [[updraft]]s, and high [[Lapse rate#Types of lapse rates|adiabatic lapse rates]] promoting thunderstorm development. All these factors combined to produce [[severe weather]] near Moscow. The tornadoes occurred in this region because an unstable and moist air mass, supported by warm [[sea surface temperature]]s over the Black Sea, had been in place four days before the outbreak began. The unusually strong intensity of the trough in the region on June&amp;nbsp;8–9, with a 500-millibar [[geopotential height]] measured at about 2.7 [[standard deviation]]s below normal, also favored an intense tornado outbreak.&lt;ref name=Finch1 /&gt;

A large, long-tracked, and devastating tornado, considered one of the worst in Russian history, destroyed numerous towns along its path. Rated F5 on the Fujita scale, the half-mile-wide (800-m)&lt;ref name=Snitkovskii /&gt;  tornado killed at least 92 people and injured more than 130 others. Several reinforced structures were completely destroyed, and about 1,180 homes were also leveled by the tornado.&lt;ref name=Alimov /&gt; Some estimates indicate up to 95 deaths&lt;ref name=Keraunos /&gt; or even more, with some sources suggesting all 400 deaths in the outbreak were related to the Ivanovo tornado.&lt;ref name=Finch1 /&gt;

At 1130&amp;nbsp;UTC&lt;ref name=Finch1 /&gt;—other sources say 1205&amp;nbsp;UTC&lt;ref name=Alimov&gt;{{cite journal|last=Alimov|first=G.|author2=A. Illesh|author3=V. Kozlov|author4=V.

Near the [[Volga River]], the tornado [[:wikt:uprooting|ripped up trees by their roots]] and destroyed many small huts. It also carried a water tank weighing {{convert|50|tonne|lb|lk=on}} for {{convert|200|yd|mi|abbr=on}}.&lt;ref name=Lyakhov /&gt;  Steel water containers capable of holding {{convert|150|m3|gal|lk=on}} of water were carried {{convert|100|m|ft|lk=on}} in the air and transported {{convert|1|km|mi|abbr=on}} from their original site. Hail in association with the parent thunderstorm weighed up to {{convert|1|kg|lb|lk=on}}, among the heaviest hailstones measured anywhere in the world;&lt;ref name=Finch1 /&gt; though the measurement came with few details, it is comparable to the world record, a hailstone also measuring {{convert|1|kg|lb|abbr=on}} in [[Bangladesh]] on April&amp;nbsp;15, 1986.&lt;ref name=Bangladesh&gt;{{cite news|title=none|newspaper=Bangladesh Observer|date=15 April 1986}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The F5 tornado tracked for {{convert|99|mi|km|sigfig=2|lk=on}}—though some sources suggest only {{convert|80|km|mi|lk=on}}&lt;ref name=Finch1 /&gt;—before dissipating near [[Lunevo]] in [[Yaroslavl Oblast]].

According to Russian researchers writing in the 1980s, this tornado was either the same as the Ivanovo tornado or a member of the Ivanovo [[tornado family]]; if the latter, it may indicate that the Ivanovo tornado was in fact two separate tornadoes spawned by the same thunderstorm.&lt;ref name=Snitkovskii /&gt; However, recent research indicates that the Ivanovo storm was not the same as the one that produced the Kostroma tornado.&lt;ref name=Finch1 /&gt;  Numerous trees were thrown long distances by the tornado. A crane weighing {{convert|350|tonne|lb|abbr=on}} was knocked over, several bridges were destroyed, and numerous other structures were damaged. The severity of the damage was rated F4; however, there are indications that the tornado may have attained F5 intensity.&lt;ref name=Snitkovskii /&gt;

At approximately 2:42&amp;nbsp;a.m.&lt;!--The collapse time is disputed. Some eyewitnesses say the collapse time was before 2:42&amp;amp;nbsp;a.m. and that 2:42 was the time of the police report--&gt; on November 18, 1999,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.cnn.com/US/9911/18/students.crushed.03/|title=Unlit bonfire collapse at Texas A&amp;M kills at least 4, injures 25|publisher=CNN|accessdate=2007-12-20|date=November 18, 1999|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070210031853/http://www.cnn.com/US/9911/18/students.crushed.03/|archivedate=February 10, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; the annual [[Aggie bonfire]] at [[Texas A&amp;M University]] in [[College Station, Texas]] '''collapsed during its construction''', killing 12 people and injuring 27.

==Collapse==
The 59-foot high stack, consisting of about 5000&amp;nbsp;logs, collapsed during construction.&lt;ref name="homeland"/&gt; Of the 58&amp;nbsp;students and former students working on the stack, 12 were killed and 27 were injured.&lt;ref name="homeland"/&gt; Immediately after the collapse, Emergency Medical Technicians and trained [[Certified first responder|First Responders]] of the Texas A&amp;M Emergency Care Team (TAMECT), a student-run, volunteer service, who staffed each stage of construction, administered first aid. TAMECT alerted the University Police and University EMS (also a student-run service), who dispatched all remaining university medics, and requested [[Mutual aid (emergency services)|mutual aid]] from the surrounding agencies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.thebatt.com/news/aggie-medics-recount-stories-of-sorrowful-day-1.1180232 |title=Aggie medics recount stories of sorrowful day |publisher=The Battalion |accessdate=2011-12-20 |date=November 17, 2009 }}{{dead link|date=June 2016|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to the mutual aid received from the College Station and [[Bryan, Texas|Bryan]], Texas EMS, Fire, and Police Departments, members of [[Urban Search and Rescue Texas Task Force 1|Texas Task Force 1]], the state's elite emergency response team, arrived to assist the rescue efforts.&lt;ref name="morton" &gt;{{citation | last = Morton | first = Anissa | title = Aggie Community Bands Together | newspaper = The Bryan-College Station Eagle | date = November 19, 1999 | url = http://www.theeagle.com/bonfire/storyarchive/november1999/191199b.htm | archive-url = https://archive.is/20070930183610/http://www.theeagle.com/bonfire/storyarchive/november1999/191199b.htm | dead-url = yes | archive-date = September 30, 2007 | accessdate = 2007-02-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Rescue operations took over 24&amp;nbsp;hours; the pace was hampered by the decision to remove many of the logs by hand for fear that using heavy equipment to remove them would cause further collapses, resulting in further injuries to those still trapped. Students, including the entire Texas A&amp;M football team and many members of the university's Corps of Cadets, rushed to the site to assist rescue workers with the manual removal of the logs.&lt;ref name="homeland"/&gt;&lt;ref name="bowen" &gt;{{citation | last = Bowen | first = Larry | title = Football Players Assist in Rescue | newspaper = The Bryan-College Station Eagle | date = November 19, 1999 | url = http://www.theeagle.com/bonfire/storyarchive/november1999/191199e.htm | archive-url = https://archive.is/20070930200950/http://www.theeagle.com/bonfire/storyarchive/november1999/191199e.htm | dead-url = yes | archive-date = September 30, 2007 | accessdate = 2007-02-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Texas A&amp;M [[civil engineering]] department was also called on to examine the site and help the workers determine the order in which the logs could be safely removed, and, at the request of the [[Texas Forest Service]], Steely Lumber Company in [[Huntsville, Texas]], sent log-moving equipment and operators.&lt;ref name="homeland"/&gt;&lt;ref name="morton"/&gt; John Comstock was the last living person to be removed from the stack. He spent months in the hospital following [[amputation]] of his left leg and partial [[paralysis]] of his right side. Comstock returned to A&amp;M in 2001 to finish his degree.&lt;ref name="kellybrown"/&gt;

==Response==

Within minutes of the collapse, word of the accident spread among students and the community. Before sunrise, the accident was the subject of news reports around the world. Within hours, 50&amp;nbsp;satellite trucks were broadcasting from the Texas A&amp;M campus.&lt;ref name="homeland"/&gt; At noon, students held an impromptu prayer service in the center of campus, at Rudder Fountain.&lt;ref name="whitmarsch" &gt;{{citation | last = Whitmarsch | first = Geneva | title = Thousands Mourn Fallen Aggies | newspaper = The Bryan-College Station Eagle | date = November 26, 1999 | url = http://www.theeagle.com/bonfire/storyarchive/november1999/261199a.htm | archive-url = https://archive.is/20041215131755/http://www.theeagle.com/bonfire/storyarchive/november1999/261199a.htm | dead-url = yes | archive-date = December 15, 2004 | accessdate = 2007-02-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; An official memorial service was held less than seventeen hours after the collapse. Over 16,000&amp;nbsp;mourners, including then [[Texas]] [[Lieutenant Governor of Texas|Lieutenant Governor]] [[Rick Perry]], packed [[Reed Arena]] to pay tribute to those who died and those who had spent all day trying to rescue the injured. At the end of the service, as A&amp;M University President Ray Bowen presented roses to the families of the dead and injured students, the crowd spontaneously stood in silence, linking arms with those standing next to them, before quietly singing "[[Amazing Grace]]". Only after all of the rescue workers and family members had left the facility did the audience depart.&lt;ref name="opiela"&gt;{{cite web|last=Opiela |first=Eric |title=Bonfire Memorial Service |publisher=Texas A&amp;M University |date=November 19, 1999 |url=http://www.msc.tamu.edu/traditions/bonfire/1999/programs/ |accessdate=2007-02-28 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070207065308/http://www.msc.tamu.edu/traditions/bonfire/1999/programs/ |archivedate= 7 February 2007 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On November 25, 1999, the date that Bonfire would have burned, Aggies instead held a vigil and remembrance ceremony. Over 40,000&amp;nbsp;people lit candles and observed up to two hours of silence at the site of the collapse, before walking to [[Kyle Field]] for [[Midnight Yell|yell practice]]. At the stadium, fans spontaneously relit their candles as the [[Texas A&amp;M University Corps of Cadets#Parson's Mounted Cavalry|Parsons Mounted Cavalry]] fired the Aggie cannon twelve times, once for each victim. Former President [[George H. W. Bush]], his wife [[Barbara Bush|Barbara]], [[Texas Governor]] [[George W. Bush]], and his wife [[Laura Bush|Laura]] attended the remembrance ceremony.&lt;ref name="whitmarsch"/&gt;

The following day, the Aggies upset the [[Texas Longhorns football|Texas Longhorns]], winning 20–16 in the [[Lone Star Showdown|annual rivalry game]]. The game began with a flyover of [[F-16 Fighting Falcon|F-16]] jets, all piloted by former A&amp;M students, in the [[missing man formation]]. This flyover was donated by Senator [[Phil Gramm]] who, as an elected official, had the title of a fly-over reserved for his death and asked that the fly-over be given instead in the honor of the 12 Aggies that died. At halftime, the [[The University of Texas Longhorn Band|Texas Longhorn Band]] dedicated their performance to the students lost and injured in the collapse, and ended by playing ''Amazing Grace'' and ''[[Taps]]'', then removing their white hats in a show of respect as they walked off the field. The [[Fightin' Texas Aggie Band]] also played a tribute to the fallen and, contrary to the usual tradition, marched off the field in a silent cadence. Aggie students, who normally sit only when the opposing band plays, stood throughout both performances and gave both [[standing ovation]]s.&lt;ref name="lebas" &gt;{{citation | last = Lebas | first = John | title = Aggies Conquer 'Horns and Heartache | newspaper= The Bryan-College Station Eagle | date = November 27, 1999 | url = http://www.theeagle.com/bonfire/storyarchive/november1999/271199a.htm | archive-url = https://archive.is/20070930200823/http://www.theeagle.com/bonfire/storyarchive/november1999/271199a.htm | dead-url = yes | archive-date = September 30, 2007 | accessdate = 2007-02-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Bonfire Memorial Commission collected the hundreds of thousands of items that were left by grieving visitors at the site of the collapse. At the Systems Building, Texas A&amp;M leaders erected pictures of the deceased students. There, over a dozen seniors left behind their [[Aggie Ring|Aggie rings]], permanently donating them to the students who did not live long enough to earn their own.&lt;ref name="baggett" &gt;{{citation | last = Baggett | first = Donnis | title = Spirit Obvious in Aggieland | newspaper = The Bryan-College Station Eagle | date = November 28, 1999 | url = http://www.theeagle.com/bonfire/storyarchive/november1999/281199.htm | archive-url = https://archive.is/20070930184351/http://www.theeagle.com/bonfire/storyarchive/november1999/281199.htm | dead-url = yes | archive-date = September 30, 2007 | accessdate = 2007-02-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; Various organizations also established funds in memory of the victims and to help with expenses incurred because of the accident. In total, the funds received exceeded [[US$]]250,000.&lt;ref name="homeland"/&gt;

==Investigations==
{{expand section|date=November 2017}}
A commission created by Texas A&amp;M University discovered that a number of factors led to the Bonfire collapse, including "excessive internal stresses" on the logs and "inadequate containment strength" in the wiring used to tie the logs together. The wiring broke after logs from upper tiers were "wedged" into lower tiers.&lt;ref name="homeland"/&gt;

The [[Texas Board of Professional Engineers]] announced in 2000 that the Aggie Bonfire met the requirements to be considered a complex construction project subject to regulation under state engineering laws and would thus have to be designed and overseen by a professional engineer.&lt;ref name="lee"/&gt;

==Aftermath and controversies==
On November 19, 1999, ''[[The Arizona Republic]]'' released a [[political cartoon]] by [[Steve Benson (cartoonist)|Steve Benson]] that compared the collapse to the [[Waco siege]] of 1993 and the 1998 [[Murder of James Byrd Jr.]] This prompted criticism and negative reactions from the Texas A&amp;M community, and the ''Republic'' removed the cartoon. Persons sent thousands of e-mails regarding the cartoon to the newspaper offices. On December 1, the newspaper sent a total of $10,000 in two checks as a [[olive branch|peace offering]] to the university, with $5,000 to the Bonfire Memorial Fund and $5,000 to the Bonfire Relief Fund. The TAMU administration declined to accept the money and returned the checks. TAMU president [[Ray Bowen]] stated "Texas A&amp;M will not allow itself to become an agent for ''The Arizona Republic'' as it tries to manage the public criticism it is receiving."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Kirsch, John|url=http://dallasnews.com/specials/bonfire/1207bon1bonfire.htm|title=A&amp;M rejects money offered by newspaper|publisher=''[[Bryan-College Station Eagle]]'' at ''[[The Dallas Morning News]]''|date=1999-12-07|accessdate=2017-11-15|deadurl=bot: unknown|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20000901041949/http://dallasnews.com/specials/bonfire/1207bon1bonfire.htm|archivedate=2000-09-01|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By 2000 Texas A&amp;M spent over $80,000 so students and administrators could travel to the funerals of the deceased, including $40,000 so 125 students and staff could attend a funeral in [[Turlock, California]] by way of private aircraft; most of the persons on board were students. The total amount of funds spent by the university on all disaster-related expenses by that date was $292,000.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Lee, Christopher|author2=Slover, Pete|url=http://dallasnews.com/specials/bonfire/0107bon1bonfire.htm|title=A&amp;M spends $292,000 after bonfire collapse|publisher=''[[The Dallas Morning News]]''|date=2000-01-07|accessdate=2017-11-15|deadurl=bot: unknown|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20000901041841/http://dallasnews.com/specials/bonfire/0107bon1bonfire.htm|archivedate=2000-09-01|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The university gave the National Forestry Hero Award to an employee of [[Huntsville, Texas]]-based Steely Lumber Co., James Gibson, for rescuing students.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dallasnews.com/bonfire/203122_BC-TX--BONFIRE.html|title=Rescuer who helped bonfire victims honored|publisher=[[Associated Press]] at ''[[The Dallas Morning News]]''|date=2000-10-30|accessdate=2017-11-15|deadurl=bot: unknown|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20010304020206/http://www.dallasnews.com/bonfire/203122_BC-TX--BONFIRE.html|archivedate=2001-03-04|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Detractors further blamed the school for the accident, saying that, in the name of tradition, administrators turned a blind eye to an unsafe structure being constructed with minimal engineering and safety protocols. Before the collapse, some&lt;!-- a nonspecific term indicating not all--&gt; people expressed concerns about the safety of the Bonfire, citing the partial collapse that occurred in a previous Bonfire, the progressively shorter Bonfire burn times (collapse of the stack after lighting) which had dropped from several hours to less than 20&amp;nbsp;minutes, and numerous incidents involving alcohol or unsafe horseplay at the Bonfire site. One of the students killed in the 1999 Bonfire collapse was under the legal drinking age yet a toxicology test showed high [[Blood alcohol level|blood-alcohol levels]]; however, lower readings in a second test and inconsistencies in the initial sampling and annotation methods led to questions about the accuracy of the original tests.&lt;ref name="brown"/&gt;&lt;ref name="pierce"/&gt;

Parents of students injured or killed in the collapse filed lawsuits against Texas A&amp;M officials, including President Ray Bowen, Vice President of Student Affairs J. Malon Southerland, the 1999 redpots, and the university.&lt;ref name="lebas2"/&gt; In one of the six lawsuits, plaintiffs alleged that A&amp;M officials violated the Bonfire victims' right of due process by placing those victims in a "state-created danger" by not ensuring Bonfire's structural integrity and by allowing unqualified students to work on the stack.&lt;ref name="pierce"/&gt; The plaintiffs pointed to a $2&amp;nbsp;million liability policy the university obtained in 1996 and [[accidental death and dismemberment insurance]] policies that the university obtained for student workers as early as 1987 as proof that the administrators knew of the dangers of Bonfire. Texas A&amp;M maintains that the insurance policies were actually purchased by an advisory committee to Bonfire and not the university.&lt;ref name="lebas2"/&gt; On May 21, 2004, Federal Judge [[Samuel B. Kent]] dismissed all claims against the Texas A&amp;M officials.&lt;ref name="pierce"/&gt; In 2005, 36 of the 64&amp;nbsp;original&amp;nbsp;defendants, including all of the redpots, settled their portion of the case for an estimated $4.25&amp;nbsp;million, paid by their insurance companies.&lt;ref name="kapitan"/&gt;&lt;ref name="avison"/&gt; The [[United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit|5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals]] dismissed the remaining lawsuits against Texas A&amp;M and its officials in April 2007.&lt;ref name="vanderwerf"/&gt; In October 2007, the [[U.S. Supreme Court]] declined to review the appeals court ruling.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.dallasnews.com/sharedcontent/dws/dn/latestnews/stories/101007dntexbonfiresuit.d0fe8a.html|title=Supreme Court won't hear Texas A&amp;M bonfire appeal|publisher=Dallas Morning News|accessdate=2007-10-09|date=2007-10-09|agency=Associated Press| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20071013103843/http://www.dallasnews.com/sharedcontent/dws/dn/latestnews/stories/101007dntexbonfiresuit.d0fe8a.html| archivedate= 13 October 2007 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For the next two years, the university pondered options for reinstating the tradition.  Bowen formed a task force, which proposed a new design.  The task force recommended that students be allowed to participate in building the Bonfire as long as they were monitored by professional construction experts.  Current and former students debated whether the proposed division of labor could be considered a student project.  The debate was rendered moot when the university discovered [[liability insurance]] for the revamped project would cost more than $2 million per year.  In 2002, Bowen announced that Bonfire was officially cancelled.&lt;ref name=espnEden/&gt; Bowen's successor [[Robert Gates]] upheld this decision, stating that a "change in the status quo regarding the future of Bonfire would be inappropriate while litigation is still on-going".&lt;ref name="mclaren"/&gt;

On October 28, 2008, Texas A&amp;M settled the final lawsuit filed against them by the victims and their families. The university agreed to pay $2.1&amp;nbsp;million and promised that if Bonfire returned to campus that "engineering oversight" would be provided.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=Texas A&amp;M settles lawsuit over bonfire deaths|date=October 28, 2008|publisher=MSNBC|author=Associated Press|url=http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/27422100/|accessdate=2008-10-28| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20081031211349/http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/27422100/| archivedate= 31 October 2008 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; The final lawsuit, filed against two companies that provided crane operators and cranes for the bonfire, was settled in April 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.star-telegram.com/2014/05/10/5809707/last-of-lawsuits-over-am-bonfire.html |title=Last of lawsuits over A&amp;M bonfire collapse is settled |date=2014-05-10 |accessdate=2014-05-10 |publisher=[[Fort Worth Star-Telegram]] |author=Baker, Sandra}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''7 March Speech of Bangabandhu''' was a speech given by [[Sheikh Mujibur Rahman]], the founding father of [[Bangladesh]] on 7 March 1971 at the [[Suhrawardy Udyan|Ramna Race Course]] in [[Dhaka]] to a gathering of over two million people. It was delivered during a period of escalating tensions between [[East Pakistan]] and the powerful political and military establishment of [[West Pakistan]]. In the speech, Rahman proclaimed: "This time the struggle is for our freedom. This time the struggle is for our independence." He announced a [[Examples of civil disobedience#Pakistan|civil disobedience]] movement in the province, calling for "every house to turn into a fortress". The speech inspired the [[Bengali people]] to prepare for a war of independence amid widespread reports of armed mobilisation by West Pakistan. The [[Bangladesh Liberation War]] began 18 days later, when the [[Pakistan Army]] launched [[Operation Searchlight]] against Bengali civilians, intelligentsia, students, politicians, and armed personnel. On 30 October 2017, [[UNESCO]] added the speech in the Memory of the World Register as a [[Memory of the World Register – Asia and the Pacific|documentary heritage]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.thedailystar.net/politics/unesco-recognises-bangabandhu-sheikh-mujibur-rahman-7th-march-speech-memory-of-the-world-1484356|title=Unesco recognises Bangabandhu’s 7th March speech|last=|first=|date=31 October 2017|work=The Daily Star|access-date=2017-10-31|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://en.unesco.org/news/international-advisory-committee-recommends-78-new-nominations-unesco-memory-world|title=International Advisory Committee recommends 78 new nominations on the UNESCO Memory of the World International Register|website=en.unesco.org|accessdate=30 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
[[Pakistan]] was created in 1947, during the [[Partition of India]], as a [[Muslim]] homeland in South Asia. Its territory comprised most of the Muslim-majority provinces of [[Presidencies and provinces of British India|British India]], including two geographically and culturally separate areas, one east of [[India]] and the other west. The western zone was popularly (and, for a period, officially) called [[West Pakistan]]; the eastern zone (modern-day [[Bangladesh]]) was called [[East Bengal]] and then [[East Pakistan]]. West Pakistan dominated the country politically, and its leaders exploited the East economically, leading to popular grievances.

When East Pakistanis, such as [[Khawaja Nazimuddin]], [[Muhammad Ali Bogra]], and [[Huseyn Shaheed Suhrawardy]], were elected [[Prime Minister of Pakistan]], they were swiftly deposed by the predominantly West Pakistani establishment. The military dictatorships of [[Ayub Khan (Field Marshal)|Ayub Khan]] (27 October 1958 – 25 March 1969) and [[Yahya Khan]] (25 March 1969 – 20 December 1971), both West Pakistanis, worsened East Pakistanis' discontent.

In 1966, the [[Bangladesh Awami League|Awami League]], led by Sheikh Mujib, launched the [[Six Point Movement]] to demand provincial autonomy for East Pakistan. The Pakistani establishment rejected the league's proposals, and the military government arrested Sheikh Mujib and charged him with treason in the [[Agartala Conspiracy Case]]. After three years in jail, Mujib was released in 1969, and the case against him was dropped in the face of mass protests and widespread violence in East Pakistan.

In 1970, the Awami League, the largest East Pakistani political party, won a landslide victory in [[Pakistani general election, 1970|national elections]], winning 167 of the 169 seats allotted to East Pakistan and a majority of the 313 seats in the National Assembly. This gave it the constitutional right to form a government. However, [[Zulfikar Ali Bhutto]], the leader of the [[Pakistan Peoples Party]] and a member of the [[Sindhis|Sindhi]] ethnic group, refused to allow Sheikh Mujib to become prime minister. Instead, he proposed having two prime ministers, one for each wing.

Negotiations began in Dhaka between the two sides. In January 1971, after the first round of negotiations, President Yahya Khan promised in the Dhaka airport that Sheikh Mujib would be the next prime minister and that the newly elected National Assembly would convene on 3 March 1971. However, Bhutto was vehemently opposed to a Bengali becoming prime minister, and he began a campaign of racially charged speeches across West Pakistan to invoke fear of Bengali domination. He warned West Pakistani MPs-elect not to travel to the East. Fearing a civil war, Bhutto secretly sent an associate, [[Mubashir Hassan]], to meet with Sheikh Mujib and members of his inner circle. It was decided that Sheikh Mujib would serve as prime minister, with Bhutto as president. These talks were kept hidden from the public and from the armed forces. Meanwhile, Bhutto pressured Yahya Khan to take a stance.

On 3 March, the convening of the National Assembly was postponed until 25 March, leading to an outcry across East Pakistan. Violence broke out in [[Dhaka]], [[Chittagong]], [[Rangpur, Bangladesh|Rangpur]], [[Comilla]], [[Rajshahi]], [[Sylhet]], and [[Khulna]], and the security forces killed dozens of unarmed protesters. There were open calls for Sheikh Mujib to declare independence from Pakistan, and the Awami League called a large public gathering at Dhaka's Ramna Race Course on 7 March to respond.

== Recording ==
The Pakistan government didn't give permission to live broadcast the speech through radio and television on 7 March 1971. AHM Salahuddin who was the then chairman of Pakistan International Film Corporation and M Abul Khayer, a then member of the [[National Assembly of Pakistan|National Assembly]] from [[East Pakistan]], made arrangements to record the video and audio of the speech. The video was recorded by actor [[Abul Khair (actor)|Abul Khair]]  who was the Director of Films under Ministry of Information of Pakistan at the time. The audio of the speech was recorded by HN Khondokar, a technician of the Ministry of Information.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.priyo.com/articles/abul-khayer-captured-the-historic-seventh-march-speech-20171123|title=ঐতিহাসিক সাতই মার্চের ভাষণ ধারণ করেছিলেন আবুল খায়ের|work=প্রিয়.কম|access-date=2018-11-16|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The audio record was developed and archived by ''Dhaka Record, a'' record label owned by M Abul Khayer. Later on, copy of the audio and video recording was handed over to Sheikh Mujib and a copy of the audio was sent to [[India]]. 3000 copies of the audio were distributed by Indian record label [[Saregama#HMV|HMV Records]] throughout the world.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

==The speech==
Bangabandhu started with the lines, "Today, I appeared before you with a heavy heart. You know everything and understand as well. We tried with our lives. But the painful matter is that today, in Dhaka, Chittagong, Khulna, Rajshahi and Rangpur, the streets are dyed red with the blood of our brethren. Today the people of Bengal want freedom, the people of Bengal want to survive, the people of Bengal want to have their rights. What wrong did we do?"

He mentioned four conditions for joining the National Assembly on 25 March:
# The immediate lifting of [[martial law]];
# The immediate withdrawal of all military personnel to their barracks;
# The immediate transfer of power to elected representatives of the people;
# A proper inquiry into the loss of life during the conflict.
He also gave several directives for a civil disobedience movement, instructing that:
# People should not pay taxes;
# Government servants should take orders only from him;
# The secretariat, government and semi-government offices, and courts in East Pakistan should observe strikes, with necessary exemptions announced from time to time;
# Only local and inter-district telephone lines should function;
# Railways and ports could continue to function, but their workers should not co-operate if they were used to repress the people of East Pakistan.
The speech lasted about 19 minutes and concluded with, "Our struggle, this time, is a struggle for our freedom. Our struggle, this time, is a struggle for our independence. Joy Bangla!"&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=q6dCHKl4IjcC|title=The Discovery of Bangla Desh|last=Srivastava|first=Prabhat|date=1 January 1972|publisher=Sanjay Publications|page=105|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=QES2AgAAQBAJ|title=The Bangladesh Reader: History, Culture, Politics|last=Guhathakurta|first=Meghna|last2=Schendel|first2=Willem van|date=22 March 2013|publisher=Duke University Press|isbn=9780822395676|page=219|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was a ''de facto'' declaration of Bangladesh's independence.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=-a4_BAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT150&amp;lpg=PT150&amp;dq=de+facto+declaration+of+Bangladesh%25E2%2580%2599s+independence&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=sP4F_IoNLt&amp;sig=Ta8et4QRgBWu-4c9Vd8f-c7RUzE&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwisud_z4JjMAhVJ9x4KHceXDjEQ6AEISzAI#v=onepage&amp;q=de%2520facto%2520declaration%2520of%2520Bangladesh%25E2%2580%2599s%2520independence&amp;f=false|title=History's Daybook: A History of the World in 366 Quotations|last=Furtado|first=Peter|date=1 November 2011|publisher=Atlantic Books|isbn=9780857899279|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

International media had descended upon East Pakistan for the speech amidst speculation that Sheikh Mujib would make a [[unilateral declaration of independence]] from Pakistan. However, keeping in mind the failures of [[Rhodesia's Unilateral Declaration of Independence]] and of the [[Nigerian Civil War|Biafra struggle in Nigeria]], he did not make a direct declaration. Nevertheless, the speech was effective in giving Bengalis a clear goal of independence.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.dhakatribune.com/bangladesh/2015/mar/26/emergence-sovereign-bangladesh|title=March 1971: The emergence of a sovereign Bangladesh {{!}} Dhaka Tribune|website=www.dhakatribune.com|access-date=18 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Historical significance==
* [[Ziaur Rahman]] (later President of Bangladesh) wrote in the magazine ''Bichittra'' on 26 March 1974 that the speech had inspired him to take part in the 1971 Liberation War.&lt;ref&gt;"৭ই মার্চের রেসকোর্স ময়দানে বঙ্গবন্ধুর ঐতিহাসিক ঘোষণা আমাদের উদ্বুদ্ধ করেছিল তাই আমরা আমাদের পরিকল্পনাকে চূড়ান্ত রূপ দিলাম।" [http://ghatok-dalal.tripod.com/zia.html Bichitra, 1974]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://bdnews24.com/bangladesh/2012/03/28/march-7-speech-inspired-zia |title=March 7 speech inspired Zia |website=bdnews24.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* The speech was included in the book ''We Shall Fight on the Beaches: The Speeches That Inspired History'', by [[Jacob F. Field]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://bdnews24.com/bangladesh/2014/08/18/historic-mar-7-speech-recognised-as-one-of-the-worlds-all-time-best|title=Historic Mar 7 speech recognised as one of the 'world’s all-time best'  |website=bdnews24.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Status as a documentary heritage ==
The speech is on the [[Memory of the World Programme#Memory of the World Register|Memory of the World Register]] of [[UNESCO]], a list of world's important documentary heritage.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; [[Irina Bokova]], Director General of UNESCO announced the decision at its headquarter in Paris on 30 October 2017.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.thedailystar.net/politics/unesco-recognition-bangabandhus-7th-march-speech-another-milestone-1484821|title='Unesco's 7th March speech recognition another milestone'|date=2017-11-01|work=The Daily Star|access-date=2017-11-05|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==In popular culture==
* The documentary film ''[[Muktir Gaan]]'', by Tareque Masud and Catherine Masud, begins with a video of the speech.
* The novelist and columnist [[Anisul Hoque]] incorporated the speech into his historical novel [[Maa (novel)|''Maa'']], published in 2004.
* In his novel ''[[The Black Coat]]'', Bangladeshi-Canadian author Neamat Imam created a character called Nur Hussain who memorised the speech during the [[Bangladesh famine of 1974]].

'''Albert Shelby Willis''' (January 22, 1843 &amp;ndash; January 6, 1897) was a [[United States House of Representatives|United States Representative]] from [[Kentucky]] and a [[United States Minister to Hawaii|Minister to Hawaii]].

==Life==
Born in [[Shelbyville, Kentucky]], Willis attended the [[common school]]s, and graduated from the [[Louisville Male High School]] in 1860. He taught school for four years before graduating from the [[University of Louisville School of Law]] in 1866. He was [[Admission to the bar in the United States|admitted to the bar]] and commenced the practice of law in Louisville. He served as [[prosecuting attorney]] for [[Jefferson County, Kentucky|Jefferson County]] from 1874 to 1877.

Willis was elected as a [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democrat]] to the [[45th United States Congress|Forty-fifth]] and to the four succeeding Congresses (March 4, 1877 – March 3, 1887). He served as chairman of the [[United States House Committee on Rivers and Harbors|Committee on Rivers and Harbors]] during the [[48th United States Congress|Forty-eighth]] and [[49th United States Congress|Forty-ninth]] Congresses. He was an unsuccessful candidate for renomination in 1886.

[[File:Willis Cartoon.jpg|left|thumb|An 1893 editorial cartoon with Willis, Queen Lili{{okina}}uokalani, and President Sanford B. Dole by the newspaper ''The Morning Call'']]He resumed the practice of law before being appointed Minister to [[Hawaii]] by President [[Grover Cleveland]] in 1893. Willis was sent to Hawaii on a secret mission to meet with deposed [[Liliuokalani|Queen Lili{{okina}}uokalani]] and obtain a promise of amnesty for those involved in the [[overthrow of the Kingdom of Hawaii]] if Cleveland restored her to the throne. Willis reported to the Secretary of State in Washington that she was intent on killing the culprits.  There was a dispute: Willis said the Queen said "beheading"; she later said she used "execute." &lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Charles W. Calhoun|authorlink=Charles W. Calhoun|title=Gilded Age Cato: The Life of Walter Q. Gresham|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=otUeBgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA150|year=2015|publisher=University Press of Kentucky|page=150}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Eric T. L.

Finally the  Queen reversed herself and told Willis she could issue an amnesty. On December 18, 1893, Willis demanded on behalf of Cleveland to dissolve the [[Provisional Government of Hawaii]] and restore the Queen to power.  Willis' mission was a failure when [[Sanford B. Dole]] sent a written reply declining the surrender of his authority to the deposed queen.  President Cleveland then referred the matter to Congress, which commissioned the [[Morgan Report]], which exonerated the U.S. minister and peacekeepers from taking any part in the Hawaiian Revolution.  Following the Morgan Report, Cleveland reversed his stance, rebuffed the queen's further pleas for interference, and maintained normal diplomatic relations with both the Provisional Government and its successor the [[Republic of Hawaii]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Nick Cleaver|title=Grover Cleveland's New Foreign Policy: Arbitration, Neutrality, and the Dawn of American Empire|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=CtQaBgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA46|year=2014|publisher=Palgrave Macmillan|pages=46–47}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Willis served as Minister to Hawaii until his death in [[Honolulu]] on January 6, 1897. An elaborate state funeral was held for him in the [[ʻIolani Palace]] (temporarily renamed the Executive Building).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title= Last Sad Rites: Funeral of U. S.

'''''Antelope''''' was a [[medium clipper]] built in 1851 in [[Medford, Massachusetts|Medford]], near [[Boston]], Massachusetts. She sailed in the [[San Francisco]], China, and Far East trades, and was known for her fine finish work and for her crew’s escape from [[pirates]]. She is often called '''''Antelope of Boston''''' to distinguish her from an [[extreme clipper]] launched in 1852, ''Antelope of New York''.

==Construction==
''Antelope'' was designed "to combine large stowage capacity with good sailing qualities." Her frame was [[Quercus alba|white oak]], with [[Pinus palustris|yellow pine]] planking and a [[Acer glabrum|rock maple]] keel.
{{quote|Her ends are clipperly in their form, and her water-lines slightly concave; and, although she has only 8 inches [[Glossary of nautical terms#D|dead rise]] at half floor, yet, as her [[Stem (ship)|stem]] is almost upright, her floor long, and her [[keel]] deep, she is expected to hold as good a wind as most of the sharp-bottomed clippers of the same register.}}

The hull was black, the inside dark buff with blue waterways. Her cabin was "beautifully panelled with [[Chloroxylon|satin]] and [[Zebrawood|zebra woods]], set off with [[rosewood|rose wood]] [[pilaster]]s." The "Boston Daily Atlas" praised ''Antelope''’s ornamental work as "infinitely superior to most of the gaudy stuff now in vogue." &lt;ref name = "bruzelius"&gt;

  | accessdate = June 27, 2010}}
&lt;/ref&gt;

==Voyages==
''Antelope'' sailed from Boston to San Francisco on her maiden voyage in 149 days, rather than the expected 130 days or less, under the well known Captain Tully Crosby. From there she sailed to [[Shanghai]], returning to [[New York City|New York]] with a passage of 118 days.

In 1853, ''Antelope'' arrived in San Francisco from New York under Captain Snow on August 31 after a passage of 128 days, returning to New York via [[Callao]] in 178 days.

After one more round trip to the West Coast of South America ''Antelope'' went into the China trade.

==''Antelope'' incident==
''Antelope''’s sailing life was six years and nine months.

In July 1858, under Captain Clarke, ''Antelope'' departed [[Bangkok]] for [[China]]. On August 6, she struck on Discovery Shoal, [[Paracel Islands|Paracels Reef]], which was not visible due to a high tide.

Captain Clarke, four passengers, and 13 seamen abandoned ship, and set out in one of the ship’s boats. A second boat, which became separated during the night, carried the mate, one seaman, and ten Chinese passengers. Four days later, a Chinese fishing [[junk (ship)|junk]] came into view. Clarke offered the fishermen $20 for a tow to a place where water could be had. Once the ''Antelope'' party was taken in tow, it became evident that the fishermen were not trustworthy. Fearing piracy, the shipwrecked party cut the tow rope and attempted an escape. The fishermen pursued the boat, attacked it with stones, and finally set two fishermen to stand guard with spears while the others robbed the ''Antelope'' party. In the midst of the confusion, two of the ''Antelope'' sailors took advantage of the distraction and boarded the fishing junk, dispatching its crew. Captain Clarke also attempted to board the junk, but fell in the water and had to be rescued. The shipwrecked ''Antelope'' party then took command of the junk, and arrived in [[Hong Kong]] on August 14.&lt;ref name="gleason"/&gt;&lt;ref name = "howev1" &gt;

'''Arena Theatre''' ({{lang-sk|Divadlo Aréna}}) is one of the oldest theatres in [[Bratislava]]. 
It was established in 1828 on the right bank of [[Danube]]. In the beginning it served as 
an open summer [[amphitheatre]], hence the name Arena. The current building was built in 
1898.

From its establishment till the end of the [[Second World War]], many [[Hungary|Hungarian]], 
[[Austria]]n and [[Germany|German]] theatre companies performed there. After the war, the 
theatre was gradually closed and served as a storehouse for state-owned Slovak Television.

The theatre was revived by a group of people around [[Mime artist|mime]] artist [[Milan Sládek]], opening performance 
took place in 1997. The repertoire consisted of several pantomimic performances, an annual 
pantomimic festival took place there.

In 2003, renowned Slovak actor [[Juraj Kukura]] became managing director and focus of the 
theatre shifted to drama. Performance ''[[The Goat or Who is Sylvia?]]''&lt;ref&gt;co-production with [[Prague]]-based [[The Drama Club (Prague)|The Drama Club]]&lt;/ref&gt; was nominated 
for [[Dosky Awards|DOSKY Award]] 2004 in categories best performance and best director, Juraj 
Kukura and [[Emília Vášáryová]] won the categories for best actor/actress. A year later, 
monodrama ''Tiso'' was voted the best performance. [[Marián Labuda]], who was performing 
[[Jozef Tiso]], won the prize for best actor.

{{History of Berlin}}

The '''Berlin Blockade''' (24 June 1948 – 12 May 1949) was one of the first major international crises of the [[Cold War]]. During the [[Allied-occupied Germany|multinational occupation of post–World War II Germany]], the [[Soviet Union]] blocked the [[Western Bloc|Western Allies]]' railway, road, and canal access to the sectors of [[Berlin]] under Western control. The Soviets offered to drop the blockade if the Western Allies withdrew the newly introduced [[Deutsche Mark]] from [[West Berlin]].

The Western Allies organised the Berlin airlift (26 June 1948–30 September 1949) to carry supplies to the people of West Berlin, a difficult feat given the size of the city's population.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite video

See e.g. [[Berlin Airlift Squadron RAAF]], which flew 2062 sorties. --&gt; providing to the West Berliners up to 12,941 tons of necessities in a day, such as fuel and food, with the original plan being to lift 3,475 tons of supplies. However, by the end of the airlift, that number was often met twofold.&lt;ref name="The Berlin Airlift." Spiritoffreedom.org. N. p., 2018. Web. 21 Oct. 2018. &lt;ref&gt; ''The American People: Creating a Nation and a Society''. New York: Pearson Longman, 2008. P 828.&lt;/ref&gt; The Soviets did not disrupt the airlift for fear this might lead to open conflict, even though they far outnumbered the allies in Germany and especially Berlin.&lt;ref&gt;Michael Laird, "Wars averted: Chanak 1922, Burma 1945–47, Berlin 1948." The ''Journal of Strategic Studies'' (1996) 19#3 pp. 343–64.&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt;Tusa, Ann, and John Tusa. The Berlin Airlift. Spellmount Publishers Ltd, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

By the spring of 1949, the airlift was clearly succeeding, and by April it was delivering more cargo than had previously been transported into the city by rail. On 12 May 1949, the USSR lifted the blockade of West Berlin, although for a time the U.S., U.K and France continued to supply the city by air anyway because they were worried that the Soviets were simply going to resume the blockade and were only trying to disrupt western supply lines. The Berlin Blockade served to highlight the competing ideological and economic visions for postwar Europe and was the first major multinational skirmish of the cold war.

==Postwar division of Germany==
[[File:Map-Germany-1947.svg|thumb|upright=1.4|400px|The red area of Germany (above) is Soviet controlled [[East Germany]]. German territory east of the [[Oder-Neisse line]] (light beige) was ceded to Poland, while a portion of the easternmost section of Germany [[East Prussia]], [[Königsberg]], was annexed by the [[Soviet Union|USSR]], as the [[Kaliningrad Oblast]].]]
From July 17 to August 2, 1945, the victorious [[Allies of World War II|Allies]] reached the [[Potsdam Agreement]] on the fate of postwar Europe, calling for the division of defeated Germany into four temporary occupation zones (thus re-affirming principles laid out earlier by the [[Yalta Conference]]). These zones were located roughly around the then-current locations of the allied armies.&lt;ref name="miller4"&gt;{{Harvnb|Miller|2000|p=4}}&lt;/ref&gt; Also divided into occupation zones, Berlin was located {{Convert|100|mi}} inside Soviet-controlled eastern Germany. The United States, United Kingdom, and France controlled western portions of the city, while Soviet troops controlled the eastern sector.&lt;ref name="miller4"/&gt;

===Soviet zone and the Allies' rights of access to Berlin===
[[File:Berlin Blockade-map.svg|thumb|upright=1.4|400px|Sectors of divided Berlin]]
[[File:BerlinerBlockadeLuftwege.png|thumb|upright=1.4|400px|The only three permissible [[West Berlin Air Corridor|air corridors to Berlin]]]]

In the eastern zone, the Soviet authorities forcibly unified the [[Communist Party of Germany]] and [[Social Democratic Party of Germany|Social Democratic Party]] (SPD) in the [[Socialist Unity Party of Germany|Socialist Unity Party ("SED")]], claiming at the time that it would not have a [[Marxism–Leninism|Marxist–Leninist]] or Soviet orientation.&lt;ref name="wettig96"&gt;{{Harvnb|Wettig|2008|pp=96–100}}&lt;/ref&gt; The SED leaders then called for the "establishment of an anti-fascist, democratic regime, a parliamentary democratic republic" while the Soviet Military Administration suppressed all other political activities.&lt;ref name="miller11"&gt;{{Harvnb|Miller|2000|p=11}}&lt;/ref&gt; Factories, equipment, technicians, managers and skilled personnel were removed to the Soviet Union.&lt;ref name="miller12"&gt;{{Harvnb|Miller|2000|p=12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a June 1945 meeting, [[Joseph Stalin|Stalin]] informed German communist leaders that he expected to slowly undermine the British position within their occupation zone, that the United States would withdraw within a year or two and that nothing would then stand in the way of a united Germany under communist control within the Soviet orbit.&lt;ref name="miller13"&gt;{{Harvnb|Miller|2000|p=13}}&lt;/ref&gt; Stalin and other leaders told visiting Bulgarian and Yugoslavian delegations in early 1946 that Germany must be both Soviet and communist.&lt;ref name="miller13"/&gt;

A further factor contributing to the Blockade was that there had never been a formal agreement guaranteeing rail and road access to Berlin through the Soviet zone. At the end of the war, western leaders had relied on Soviet goodwill to provide them with access.&lt;ref name="miller6"&gt;{{Harvnb|Miller|2000|p=6}}&lt;/ref&gt; At that time, the western allies assumed that the Soviets' refusal to grant any cargo access other than one rail line, limited to ten trains per day, was temporary, but the Soviets refused expansion to the various additional routes that were later proposed.&lt;ref name="miller7"&gt;{{Harvnb|Miller|2000|p=7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Soviets also granted only [[West Berlin Air Corridor|three air corridors]] for access to Berlin from [[Hamburg]], [[Bückeburg]], and [[Frankfurt]].&lt;ref name="miller7"/&gt; In 1946 the Soviets stopped delivering agricultural goods from their zone in eastern Germany, and the American commander, [[Lucius D. Clay]], responded by stopping shipments of dismantled industries from western Germany to the Soviet Union. In response, the Soviets started a public relations campaign against American policy and began to obstruct the administrative work of all four zones of occupation.

Until the blockade began in 1948, the Truman Administration had not decided whether American forces should remain in West Berlin after the establishment of a West German government, planned for 1949.&lt;ref&gt;Larson (2011)&lt;/ref&gt;

===Focus on Berlin and the elections of 1946===
Berlin quickly became the focal point of both US and Soviet efforts to re-align Europe to their respective visions. As Soviet Foreign Minister [[Vyacheslav Molotov]] noted, "What happens to Berlin, happens to Germany; what happens to Germany, happens to Europe."&lt;ref name=truback&gt;''Airbridge to Berlin'', "Background on Conflict" chapter&lt;/ref&gt; Berlin had suffered enormous damage; its prewar population of 4.3&amp;nbsp;million people was reduced to 2.8&amp;nbsp;million.

After harsh treatment, forced emigration, political repression and the particularly hard winter of 1945–1946, Germans in the Soviet-controlled zone were hostile to Soviet endeavours.&lt;ref name="miller13"/&gt; [[Berlin state election, 1946|Local elections in 1946]] resulted in a massive anti-communist protest vote, especially in the Soviet sector of Berlin.&lt;ref name="miller13"/&gt; Berlin's citizens overwhelmingly elected non-Communist members to its city government.

==Political division==

===Moves towards a West German state===
Meanwhile, to coordinate the economies of the British and United States occupation zones, these were combined on 1 January 1947 into what was referred to as the [[Bizone]]&lt;ref name="miller13"/&gt; (renamed "the Trizone" when France joined on 1 June 1948). After March 1946 the British zonal advisory board (Zonenbeirat) was established, with representatives of the states, the central offices, political parties, trade unions, and consumer organisations. As indicated by its name, the zonal advisory board had no legislative power, but was merely advisory. The Control Commission for Germany – British Element made all decisions with its legislative power. In reaction to the Soviet and British advances, in October 1945 the [[Office of Military Government, United States]] (OMGUS) encouraged the states in the US zone to form a co-ordinating body, the so-called Länderrat (council of states), with the power to legislate for the entire US zone. It created its own central bodies (Ausschüsse or joint interstate committees) headed by a secretariat seated in [[Stuttgart]]. While the British and Soviet central administrations were allied institutions, these US zone committees were not OMGUS subdivisions, but instead were autonomous bodies of German self-rule under OMGUS supervision.

Representatives of these three governments, along with the [[Benelux]] nations, met twice in London ([[London Six-Power Conference|London 6-Power Conference]]) in the first half of 1948 to discuss the future of Germany, going ahead despite Soviet threats to ignore any resulting decisions.&lt;ref name="miller18"&gt;{{Harvnb|Miller|2000|p=18}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="turner23"&gt;{{Harvnb|Turner|1987|p=23}}&lt;/ref&gt; Eventually the '''London Agreement on German External Debts''', also known as the '''London Debt Agreement''' (German: ''Londoner Schuldenabkommen''), was concluded. Under the London Debts Agreement of 1953, the repayable amount was reduced by 50% to about 15 billion marks and stretched out over 30 years, and compared to the fast-growing German economy were of minor impact.&lt;ref&gt;Timothy W. Guinnane, "Financial Vergangenheitsbewältigung: The 1953 London Debt Agreement" (Economic Growth Center, Yale University, 2004) pp. 17, 20–21, 27–28, 30 [http://ssrn.com/abstract=493802 online]&lt;/ref&gt;

In response to the announcement of the first of these meetings, in late January 1948, the Soviets began stopping British and American trains to Berlin to check passenger identities.&lt;ref name="miller20"&gt;{{Harvnb|Miller|2000|p=20}}&lt;/ref&gt; As outlined in an announcement on 7 March 1948, all of the governments present approved the extension of the [[Marshall Plan]] to Germany, finalised the economic merger of the western occupation zones in Germany and agreed upon the establishment of a [[federalism|federal system of government]] for them.&lt;ref name="miller18"/&gt;&lt;ref name="turner23"/&gt;

After a 9 March meeting between Stalin and his military advisers, a secret memorandum was sent to Molotov on 12 March 1948, outlining a plan to force the policy of the western allies into line with the wishes of the Soviet government by "regulating" access to Berlin.&lt;ref name="miller19"&gt;{{Harvnb|Miller|2000|p=19}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Allied Control Council]] (ACC) met for the last time on 20 March 1948, when [[Vasily Sokolovsky]] demanded to know the outcome of the London Conference and, on being told by negotiators that they had not yet heard the final results from their governments, he said, "I see no sense in continuing this meeting, and I declare it adjourned."&lt;ref name="miller19"/&gt;

The entire Soviet delegation rose and walked out. Truman later noted, "For most of Germany, this act merely formalised what had been an obvious fact for some time, namely, that the four-power control machinery had become unworkable. For the city of Berlin, however, this was an indication for a major crisis."&lt;ref name=trueye&gt;''Airbridge to Berlin'', "Eye of the Storm" chapter&lt;/ref&gt;

===April Crisis and the Little Air Lift===
On 25 March 1948, the Soviets issued orders restricting Western military and passenger traffic between the American, British and French occupation zones and Berlin.&lt;ref name="miller20"/&gt; These new measures began on 1 April along with an announcement that no cargo could leave Berlin by rail without the permission of the Soviet commander. Each train and truck was to be searched by the Soviet authorities.&lt;ref name="miller20"/&gt; On 2 April, General Clay ordered a halt to all military trains and required that supplies to the military garrison be transported by air, in what was dubbed the "Little Lift".&lt;ref name="miller20"/&gt;

The Soviets eased their restrictions on Allied military trains on 10 April 1948, but continued periodically to interrupt rail and road traffic during the next 75 days, while the United States continued supplying its military forces by using cargo aircraft.&lt;ref name="miller26"&gt;{{Harvnb|Miller|2000|p=26}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some 20 flights a day continued through June, building up stocks of food against future Soviet actions,&lt;ref name="rgm15"&gt;{{harvnb|Miller|1998|p=15}}&lt;/ref&gt; so that by the time the blockade began at the end of June, at least 18 days' supply per major food type, and in some types, much more, had been stockpiled that provided time to build up the ensuing airlift.&lt;ref name="rgm2728"&gt;{{harvnb|Miller|1998|pp=27–28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At the same time, Soviet military aircraft began to violate West Berlin airspace and would harass, or what the military called "buzz", flights in and out of West Berlin.&lt;ref name=times02debert&gt;{{cite news | first=Delbert | last=Clarks | title=Clay Halts Trains | newspaper=[[The New York Times]] | date=2 April 1948 | page=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 5 April, a [[Soviet Air Forces|Soviet Air Force]] [[Yakovlev Yak-3]] fighter collided with a [[British European Airways]] [[Vickers VC.1 Viking|Vickers Viking 1B]] airliner near [[RAF Gatow|RAF Gatow airfield]], killing all aboard both aircraft. The [[1948 Gatow air disaster|Gatow air disaster]] exacerbated tensions between the Soviets and the other allied powers.&lt;ref name=pci&gt;{{Cite web| publisher=PlaneCrashInfo.com | url=http://www.planecrashinfo.com/1948/1948-26.htm| title= Accident Details| accessdate=27 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=asn&gt;{{Cite web| url=http://aviation-safety.net/database/record.php?id=19480405-0&amp;lang=en| title=Accident| accessdate=27 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=times06details&gt;{{cite news | first=Delbert | last=Clarks | title=Soviet-British Plane Collision Kills 15; Russian Apologizes | newspaper=[[The New York Times]] | date=6 April 1948 | page=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; Internal Soviet reports in April stated that "Our control and restrictive measures have dealt a strong blow to the prestige of the Americans and British in Germany" and that the Americans have "admitted" that the idea of an airlift would be too expensive.&lt;ref name="miller23"&gt;{{Harvnb|Miller|2000|p=23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 9 April, Soviet officials demanded that American military personnel maintaining communication equipment in the Eastern zone must withdraw, thus preventing the use of navigation beacons to mark air routes.&lt;ref name="miller26"/&gt; On 20 April, the Soviets demanded that all barges obtain clearance before entering the Soviet zone.&lt;ref name="miller27"&gt;{{Harvnb|Miller|2000|p=27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Currency crisis===
{{Further |Heinrich Rau|East German mark|Deutsche Mark}}
Creation of an economically stable western Germany required reform of the unstable [[Reichsmark]] German currency introduced after the [[Hyperinflation in the Weimar Republic |1920s German inflation]]. The Soviets had debased the Reichsmark by excessive printing, resulting in Germans using cigarettes as a [[de facto currency]] or for bartering.&lt;ref name= "miller31"&gt;{{Harvnb |Miller |2000 |p=31}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name= "turner24"&gt;{{Harvnb |Turner |1987 |p=24}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Soviets opposed western plans for a reform.&lt;ref name= "miller31"/&gt;&lt;ref name= "turner24" /&gt; They interpreted the new currency as an unjustified, unilateral decision, and responded by cutting all land links between West Berlin and West Germany. The Soviets believed that the only currency that should be allowed to circulate was the currency that they issued themselves.&lt;ref name= "amandaplease21"&gt;{{Citation | last = Thody | first = Phillip Malcom Waller | chapter = Berlin Crisis of 1948–1949 and 1958–1962 | title = Europe since 1945 | place = London | publisher = Routledge | year = 2000}}.  N. pag.  Print.&lt;/ref&gt; In February 1948, the Americans and British had proposed to the ACC that a new German currency be created, replacing the over-circulated and devalued Reichsmark. The Soviets refused to accept this proposal, hoping to continue the German recession, in keeping with their policy of a weak Germany.&lt;ref name="stentx"&gt;{{Harvnb |Stent |2000 |p= x}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Anticipating the introduction of a new currency by the other countries in the non-Soviet zones, the Soviet Union in May 1948 directed its military to introduce its own new currency and to permit only the Soviet currency to be used in their sector of Berlin, if the other countries brought in a different currency there.&lt;ref name= "miller31" /&gt; On 18 June the United States, Britain and France announced that on 21 June the [[Deutsche Mark]] would be introduced, but the Soviets refused to permit its use as legal tender in Berlin.&lt;ref name= "miller31"/&gt; The Allies had already transported 250,000,000 Deutsche marks into the city and it quickly became the standard currency in all four sectors. Against the wishes of the Soviets, the new currency, along with the [[Marshall Plan]] that backed it, appeared to have the potential to revitalise Germany. Stalin looked to force the Western nations to abandon Berlin.

==Start of the Berlin Airlift==

===Beginning of the blockade===
{{Eastern Bloc sidebar}}
The day after the 18 June 1948 announcement of the new [[Deutsche Mark]], Soviet guards halted all passenger trains and traffic on the autobahn to Berlin, delayed Western and German freight shipments and required that all water transport secure special Soviet permission.&lt;ref name="miller31"/&gt; On 21 June, the day the Deutsche Mark was introduced, the Soviet military halted a United States military supply train to Berlin and sent it back to western Germany.&lt;ref name="miller31"/&gt; On 22 June, the Soviets announced that they would introduce a [[East German mark|new currency]] in their zone.&lt;ref name="miller32"/&gt;

That same day, a Soviet representative told the other three occupying powers that "We are warning both you and the population of Berlin that we shall apply economic and administrative sanctions that will lead to the circulation in Berlin exclusively of the currency of the Soviet occupation zone."&lt;ref name="miller32"&gt;{{Harvnb|Miller|2000|p=32}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Soviets launched a massive propaganda campaign condemning Britain, the United States and France by radio, newspaper and loudspeaker.&lt;ref name="miller32"/&gt; The Soviets conducted well-advertised military maneuvers just outside the city. Rumors of a potential occupation by Soviet troops spread quickly. German communists demonstrated, rioted and attacked pro-West German leaders attending meetings for the municipal government in the Soviet sector.&lt;ref name="miller32"/&gt;

On 24 June, the Soviets severed land and water connections between the non-Soviet zones and Berlin.&lt;ref name="miller32"/&gt; That same day, they halted all rail and barge traffic in and out of Berlin.&lt;ref name="miller32"/&gt; The West answered by introducing a counter-blockade, stopping all rail traffic into East Germany from the British and US zones. Over the following months this counter-blockade would have a damaging impact on East Germany, as the drying up of coal and steel shipments seriously hindered industrial development in the Soviet zone.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Berlin 1948–1949 A Divided City|url=http://homepages.stmartin.edu/Fac_Staff/rlangill/PLS%20310/Berlin%201948-%20Isaac.htm|accessdate=12 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Burgan|first1=Michael|title=The Berlin Airlift: Breaking the Soviet Blockade|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=NvNRPq_k_U8C&amp;pg=PT36&amp;lpg=PT36&amp;dq=berlin+counter+blockade&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=0PRfhjxAlU&amp;sig=eq5NHUwPKrazKlgL20k8ILNwnw8&amp;hl=es&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwj7kfC-tOrRAhXLTSYKHQCBAxo4ChDoAQg7MAg#v=onepage&amp;q=berlin%20counter%20blockade&amp;f=false|website=Google Books|accessdate=12 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 25 June, the Soviets stopped supplying food to the civilian population in the non-Soviet sectors of Berlin.&lt;ref name="miller32"/&gt; Motor traffic from Berlin to the western zones was permitted, but this required a {{Convert|23|km|adj=on}} detour to a ferry crossing because of alleged "repairs" to a bridge.&lt;ref name="miller32"/&gt; They also cut off the electricity relied on by Berlin, using their control over the generating plants in the Soviet zone.&lt;ref name="turner24"/&gt;

Surface traffic from non-Soviet zones to Berlin was blockaded, leaving open only the air corridors.&lt;ref name="miller32"/&gt; The Soviets rejected arguments that the occupation rights in the non-Soviet sectors of Berlin and the use of the supply routes during the previous three years had given Britain, France and the United States a legal claim to use of the highways, tunnels, railroads, and canals. Relying on Soviet goodwill after the war, Britain, France, and the United States had never negotiated an agreement with the Soviets to guarantee these land-based rights of access to Berlin through the Soviet zone.&lt;ref name="miller6"/&gt;

At the time, [[West Berlin]] had 36 days' worth of food, and 45 days' worth of coal. Militarily, the Americans and British were greatly outnumbered because of the postwar scaling back of their armies. The United States, like other western countries, had disbanded most of its troops and was largely inferior in the European theatre.&lt;ref name="wettig168"&gt;{{Harvnb|Wettig|2008|p=168}}&lt;/ref&gt; The entire United States Army had been reduced to 552,000 men by February 1948.&lt;ref name="miller28"&gt;{{Harvnb|Miller|2000|p=28}}&lt;/ref&gt; Military forces in the western sectors of Berlin numbered only 8,973 Americans, 7,606 British and 6,100 French.&lt;ref name="miller33"/&gt; Of the 98,000 American troops in West Germany in March 1948, only 31,000 were combat forces, and only one reserve division was immediately available in the United States.&lt;ref name="jstor2009841"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Dawson | first1 = R. | last2 = Rosecrance | first2 = R.  | year = 1966 | title = Theory and Reality in the Anglo-American Alliance | journal = World Politics | volume = 19 | issue = 1 | pages = 21–51 | publisher =  | doi = 10.2307/2009841 | jstor = 2009841 | format =  }}&lt;/ref&gt; Soviet military forces in the Soviet sector that surrounded Berlin totaled 1.5 million.&lt;ref name="miller30"&gt;{{Harvnb|Miller|2000|p=30}}&lt;/ref&gt; The two United States regiments in Berlin could have provided little resistance against a Soviet attack.&lt;ref name="miller29"&gt;{{Harvnb|Miller|2000|p=29}}&lt;/ref&gt; Because of the imbalance, U.S. war plans were based on using hundreds of atomic bombs, but only about 50 [[Fat Man]]-specification bombs, the only version available to the US military, existed in mid-1948. In March 1948, only 35 "[[Silverplate]]" atomic-capable [[Boeing B-29 Superfortress]] bombers—just over half of the 65 ''Silverplate'' specification B-29 aircraft built through the end of 1947—and a few trained flight and assembly crews were available. Three B-29 groups arrived in Europe in July and August 1948.&lt;ref name="rgm2431"&gt;{{harvnb|Miller|1998|pp=24, 31}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref group=nb&gt; The [[28th Operations Group|28th]] and [[307th Operations Group|307th Bomb Groups]] were deployed to England, while the [[301st Operations Group|301st Bomb Group]] were assigned to [[Fürstenfeldbruck]], Germany. In all, about 90 conventionally-armed B-29s were assigned.&lt;/ref&gt; Despite the intention to signal the threat of the West's ability to retaliate with nuclear weapons if necessary, the Soviets possibly knew that none of the bombers were atomic-capable. The first Silverplate bombers only arrived to Europe near the end of the crisis in April 1949.{{r|young200701}}

General [[Lucius D. Clay]], in charge of the U.S. Occupation Zone in Germany, summed up the reasons for not retreating in a cable to Washington, D.C. on 13 June 1948: "There is no practicability in maintaining our position in Berlin and it must not be evaluated on that basis.... We are convinced that our remaining in Berlin is essential to our prestige in Germany and in Europe. Whether for good or bad, it has become a symbol of the American intent."&lt;ref name=tru11&gt;''Airbridge to Berlin'', Chapter 11&lt;/ref&gt;

Believing that Britain, France, and the United States had little option than to acquiesce, the Soviet Military Administration in Germany celebrated the beginning of the blockade.&lt;ref name="miller35"&gt;{{Harvnb|Miller|2000|p=35}}&lt;/ref&gt; General Clay felt that the Soviets were bluffing about Berlin since they would not want to be viewed as starting a [[World War III|Third World War]]. He believed that Stalin did not want a war and that Soviet actions were aimed at exerting military and political pressure on the West to obtain concessions, relying on the West's prudence and unwillingness to provoke a war.&lt;ref name="miller33"&gt;{{Harvnb|Miller|2000|p=33}}&lt;/ref&gt; Commander of [[United States Air Forces in Europe - Air Forces Africa|United States Air Forces in Europe]] (USAFE) General [[Curtis LeMay]] reportedly favoured an aggressive response to the blockade, in which his B-29s with fighter escort would approach Soviet air bases while ground troops attempted to reach Berlin; Washington vetoed the plan.&lt;ref name="young200701"&gt;{{cite journal | jstor=30036432  | title=US 'Atomic Capability' and the British Forward Bases in the Early Cold War | author=Young, Ken | journal=Journal of Contemporary History |date=January 2007 | volume=42 | issue=1 | pages=117–36 | doi=10.1177/0022009407071626}}{{page needed|date=January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Decision for an airlift===
Although the ground routes had never been negotiated, the same was not true of the air. On 30 November 1945, it had been agreed in writing that there would be three twenty-mile-wide air corridors providing free access to Berlin.&lt;ref name=spirit&gt;[http://www.spiritoffreedom.org/airlift.html spiritoffreedom.org: ''The Berlin Airlift'']&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, unlike a force of tanks and trucks, the Soviets could not claim that cargo aircraft were a military threat. In the face of unarmed aircraft refusing to turn around, the only way to enforce the blockade would have been to shoot them down. An airlift would put the Soviet Union in the position of either shooting down unarmed humanitarian aircraft, thus breaking their own agreements, or backing down.

The airlift option critically depended on scale and effectiveness. If the supplies could not be flown in fast enough, Soviet help would eventually be needed to prevent starvation. Clay was told to take advice from General LeMay to see if an airlift was possible. Initially taken aback by the inquiry, which was "Can you haul coal?", LeMay replied "We can haul anything."&lt;ref name=spirit/&gt;

When American forces consulted Britain's [[Royal Air Force]] (RAF) about a possible joint airlift, they learned the RAF was already running an airlift in support of British troops in Berlin. General Clay's counterpart, General [[Brian Robertson, 1st Baron Robertson of Oakridge|Sir Brian Robertson]], was ready with some concrete numbers. During the ''Little Lift'' in April 1948,&lt;ref name="miller20"/&gt; British Air Commodore [[Reginald Waite]] had calculated the resources required to support the entire city.{{citation needed|date=December 2013}}

The American military government, based on a minimum daily ration of 1,990 kilocalories (July 1948),&lt;ref name="rgm20"&gt;{{harvnb|Miller|1998|p=20}}&lt;/ref&gt; set a total of daily supplies needed at 646 tons of flour and wheat, 125 tons of cereal, 64 tons of fat, 109 tons of meat and fish, 180 tons of dehydrated potatoes, 180 tons of sugar, 11 tons of coffee, 19 tons of powdered milk, 5 tons of whole milk for children, 3 tons of fresh yeast for baking, 144 tons of dehydrated vegetables, 38 tons of salt and 10 tons of cheese. In all, 1,534 tons were required each day to sustain the over two million people of Berlin.&lt;ref name=spirit/&gt;&lt;ref name="rgm28"&gt;{{harvnb|Miller|1998|p=28}}&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, for heat and power, 3,475 tons of coal, diesel and petrol were also required daily.&lt;ref name=pbs&gt;[https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/amex/airlift/filmmore/pt.html pbs.org: ''The Berlin Airlift'']&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:C-47s at Tempelhof Airport Berlin 1948.jpg|thumb|[[Douglas C-47 Skytrain|C-47 Skytrains]] unloading at [[Berlin Tempelhof Airport|Tempelhof Airport]] during the Berlin Airlift]]

Carrying all this in would not be easy. The postwar demobilisation left the US forces in Europe with only two [[Group (military aviation unit)|groups]]&lt;ref name="rgm22"&gt;{{harvnb|Miller|1998|p=22}}&lt;/ref&gt; of [[Douglas C-47 Skytrain|C-47 Skytrain]] transports (the military version of the [[Douglas DC-3]], which the British called "Dakota"), nominally 96 aircraft, each of which could carry about 3.5 tons of cargo. LeMay believed that "with an all-out effort" of 100 daily round trips these would be able to haul about 300 tons of supplies a day.&lt;ref name="rgm30"/&gt; The RAF was somewhat better prepared, since it had already moved some aircraft into the German area, and they expected to be able to supply about 400 tons a day.

This was not nearly enough to move the 5,000 tons a day that would be needed, but these numbers could be increased as new aircraft arrived from the United Kingdom, the United States, and France. The RAF would be relied on to increase its numbers quickly. It could fly additional aircraft in from Britain in a single hop, bringing the RAF fleet to about 150 Dakotas and 40 of the larger [[Avro York]]s with a 10-ton [[payload]].

With this fleet, the British contribution was expected to rise to 750 tons a day in the short term, a month, but even that at the cost of suspending all air traffic except for the airlift to Berlin and Warsaw.&lt;ref name="rgm30"&gt;{{harvnb|Miller|1998|p=30}}&lt;/ref&gt; For a longer-term operation, the US would have to add additional aircraft as soon as possible, and those would have to be as large as possible while still able to fly into the Berlin airports. Only one aircraft type was suitable, the four-engined [[Douglas C-54 Skymaster|C-54 Skymaster]] and its [[United States Navy|US Navy]] equivalent, the R5D, of which the US military had approximately 565, with 268 Air Force and Navy Skymasters in [[Military Air Transport Service|MATS]], 168 in the troop carrier groups, and 80 Navy R5Ds in miscellaneous commands. Planners calculated that including C-54s already ordered to Germany and drawing on those flying with civilian carriers, 447 Skymasters could be available for an "extreme emergency."&lt;ref name="rgm50"&gt;{{harvnb|Miller|1998|p=50}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Given the feasibility assessment made by the British, an airlift appeared to be the best course of action. One remaining concern was the population of Berlin. Clay called in [[Ernst Reuter]], the mayor-elect of Berlin, accompanied by his aide, [[Willy Brandt]]. Clay told Reuter, "Look, I am ready to try an airlift. I can't guarantee it will work. I am sure that even at its best, people are going to be cold and people are going to be hungry. And if the people of Berlin won't stand that, it will fail. And I don't want to go into this unless I have your assurance that the people will be heavily in approval." Reuter, although skeptical, assured Clay that Berlin would make all the necessary sacrifices and that the Berliners would support his actions.&lt;ref name=tru11/&gt;

General [[Albert Coady Wedemeyer|Albert Wedemeyer]], the US Army Chief of Plans and Operations, was in Europe on an inspection tour when the crisis broke out. He had been the commander of the US [[China Burma India Theater]] in 1944–45 and he had a detailed knowledge of the previously-largest airlift—the World War II American airlift from India over [[the Hump]] of the [[Himalayas]] to China. His endorsement of the airlift option gave it a major boost.&lt;ref name=tru11/&gt; The British and Americans agreed to start a joint operation without delay; the US action was dubbed "Operation Vittles,"&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Miller|2000|p=58}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref group=nb&gt;Miller acknowledges that most histories credit Smith with coining the term by dramatically stating: "Hell's Fire! We're hauling grub. Call it Operation Vittles!" However, he states that the origin is "probably more prosaic" and due to Col. William O. Large, Jr., a duty officer in the Operations Division of Headquarters USAF in the Pentagon. At the time a codename was needed to coordinate activities. Large suggested "Vittles" because of its probable unfamiliarity to the Soviets. (Miller 2000, p. 58)&lt;/ref&gt; while the British action was called "Operation Plainfare".&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Miller|2000|p=65}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref group=nb&gt;The original code name for the RAF operation was "[[Carter Paterson]]", a noted British hauling (U.S.="moving") firm. A caustic Soviet jest {{clarify|date=January 2017}} prompted the change to "Plainfare", a deliberate pun on "plane fare" (airplane/food), on 19 July.&lt;/ref&gt; The Australian contribution to the airlift, begun in September 1948, was designated "[[RAAF Squadron Berlin Air Lift|Operation Pelican]]."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://airpower.airforce.gov.au/Publications/Details/226/Operation-Pelican-The-Australian-Air-Force-in-the-Berlin-Airlift-with-companion-CDROM.aspx|title=Operation Pelican: The Australian Air Force in the Berlin Airlift|author=Dr Chris Clark|date=March 2008|accessdate=14 February 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The British asked Canada to contribute planes and crews. It refused, primarily on the grounds that the operation risked war and Canada had not been consulted.&lt;ref&gt;James Eayrs, ''In Defence of Canada: volume 4: Growing Up Allied'' (1980) pp. 39–51&lt;/ref&gt;

===Airlift begins===
[[File:Berlin Blockade Milk.jpg|thumb|upright|Loading milk on a West Berlin-bound aircraft]]

On 24 June 1948 LeMay appointed Brigadier General Joseph Smith, headquarters commandant for USAFE at [[Lucius D. Clay Kaserne|Camp Lindsey]], as the Provisional Task Force Commander of the airlift. Smith had been chief of staff in LeMay's B-29 command in India during World War II and had no airlift experience. {{Citation needed|date=March 2017}} On 25 June 1948 Clay gave the order to launch Operation Vittles. The next day 32 C-47s lifted off for Berlin hauling 80 tons of cargo, including milk, flour, and medicine. The first British aircraft flew on 28 June. At that time, the airlift was expected to last three weeks. {{Citation needed|date=March 2017}}

On 27 June, Clay cabled [[William Henry Draper Jr.|William Draper]] with an estimate of the current situation:
{{quote|I have already arranged for our maximum airlift to start on Monday [June 28]. For a sustained effort, we can use seventy Dakotas [C-47s]. The number which the British can make available is not yet known, although General Robertson is somewhat doubtful of their ability to make this number available. Our two Berlin airports can handle in the neighborhood of fifty additional airplanes per day. These would have to be C-47s, C-54s or planes with similar landing characteristics, as our airports cannot take larger planes. LeMay is urging two C-54 groups. With this airlift, we should be able to bring in 600 or 700 tons a day. While 2,000 tons a day is required in normal foods, 600 tons a day (utilizing dried foods to the maximum extent) will substantially increase the morale of the German people and will unquestionably seriously disturb the Soviet blockade. To accomplish this, it is urgent that we be given approximately 50 additional transport planes to arrive in Germany at the earliest practicable date, and each day's delay will of course decrease our ability to sustain our position in Berlin. Crews would be needed to permit maximum operation of these planes.|[[Lucius D. Clay]], June 1948&lt;ref name=tru11/&gt;}}

By 1 July, the system was getting under way. C-54s were starting to arrive in quantity, and [[Rhein-Main Air Base]] became exclusively a C-54 hub, while [[Wiesbaden]] retained a mix of C-54s and C-47s. Aircraft flew northeast through the American [[West Berlin Air Corridor|air corridor]] into [[Berlin Tempelhof Airport|Tempelhof Airport]], then returned due west flying out on through the British air corridor. After reaching the British Zone, they turned south to return to their bases. {{Citation needed|date=March 2017}}

[[File:Germans-airlift-1948.jpg|thumb|Germans watching supply planes at Tempelhof]]
[[File:Berlin airlift.ogv|thumb|thumbtime=16|1950s film by the British Government about the Berlin airlift]]

The British ran a similar system, flying southeast from several airports in the [[Hamburg]] area through their second corridor into [[RAF Gatow]] in the British Sector, and then also returning out on the center corridor, turning for home or landing at [[Hanover]]. However, unlike the Americans, the British also ran some round-trips, using their southeast corridor. To save time many flights didn't land in Berlin, instead air dropping material, such as coal, into the airfields. On 6 July the Yorks and [[Douglas DC-3|Dakotas]] were joined by [[Short Sunderland]] [[flying boat]]s. Flying from [[Finkenwerder]] on the [[Elbe]] near [[Hamburg]] to the [[Havel]] river next to Gatow, their corrosion-resistant hulls suited them to the particular task of delivering baking powder and other salt into the city.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The World That Came in from the Cold|last=Partos|first=Gabriel|publisher=Royal Institute of International Affairs|year=1993|isbn=|location=London|page=33}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Accommodating the large number of flights to Berlin of dissimilar aircraft with widely varying flight characteristics required close co-ordination. Smith and his staff developed a complex timetable for flights called the "block system": three eight-hour shifts of a C-54 section to Berlin followed by a C-47 section. Aircraft were scheduled to take off every four minutes, flying 1,000 feet higher than the flight in front. This pattern began at 5,000 feet and was repeated five times. (This system of stacked inbound serials was later dubbed "the ladder.")&lt;ref name="miller2000_90"&gt;{{Harvnb|Miller|2000|p=90}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="miller116"&gt;{{Harvnb|Miller|2000|pp=116–17}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=mac&gt;''MAC and the Legacy of the Berlin Airlift''&lt;/ref&gt;

During the first week the airlift averaged only ninety tons a day, but by the second week it reached 1,000 tons. This likely would have sufficed had the effort lasted only a few weeks, as originally believed. The Communist press in [[East Berlin]] ridiculed the project. It derisively referred to "the futile attempts of the Americans to save face and to maintain their untenable position in Berlin."&lt;ref name=indiana&gt;[http://www.indianamilitary.org/ATTERBURYAAF/History/BerlinAirlift.html ''Fifty years ago, a massive airlift into Berlin showed the Soviets that a post-WW II blockade would not work''], C.V. Glines&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite the excitement engendered by glamorous publicity extolling the work (and over-work) of the crews and the daily increase of tonnage levels, the airlift was not close to being operated to its capability because USAFE was a tactical organisation without any airlift expertise. Maintenance was barely adequate, crews were not being efficiently used, transports stood idle and disused, necessary record-keeping was scant, and ad hoc flight crews of publicity-seeking desk personnel were disrupting a business-like atmosphere.&lt;ref name="wht"&gt;{{Harvnb|Tunner|1964|p=160}}&lt;/ref&gt; This was recognised by the [[United States National Security Council]] at a meeting with Clay on 22 July 1948, when it became clear that a long-term airlift was necessary. Wedemeyer immediately recommended that the deputy commander for operations of the [[Military Air Transport Service]] (MATS), Maj. Gen. [[William H. Tunner]], command the operation. When Wedemeyer had been the commander of US forces in China during World War II, Tunner, as commander of the [[India-China Division, Air Transport Command|India-China Division]] of the [[Air Transport Command]], had reorganised [[the Hump]] airlift between India and China, doubling the tonnage and hours flown. USAF Chief of Staff [[Hoyt Vandenberg|Hoyt S. Vandenberg]] endorsed the recommendation.&lt;ref name="miller2000_90"/&gt;

===Black Friday===
On 28 July 1948, Tunner arrived in [[Wiesbaden]] to take over the operation.&lt;ref name="miller2000_87"&gt;{{Harvnb|Miller|2000|p=87}}&lt;/ref&gt; He revamped the entire airlift operation, reaching an agreement with LeMay to form the ''Combined Air Lift Task Force'' (CALTF) to control both the USAFE and RAF lift operations from a central location, which went into effect in mid-October 1948. MATS immediately deployed eight squadrons of C-54s—72 aircraft to Wiesbaden and [[Rhein-Main Air Base]] to reinforce the 54 already in operation, the first by 30 July and the remainder by mid-August, and two-thirds of all C-54 aircrew worldwide began transferring to Germany to allot three crews per aircraft.&lt;ref name="miller2000_93"&gt;{{Harvnb|Miller|2000|p=93}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:C-74 Globemaster unloading flour at Berlin Gatow during Operation Vittles.jpg|thumb|A [[Douglas C-74 Globemaster|C-74 Globemaster]] plane at Gatow airfield on 19 August with more than 20 tons of flour from the United States]]

Two weeks after his arrival, on 13 August, Tunner decided to fly to Berlin to grant an award to Lt. Paul O. Lykins, an airlift pilot who had made the most flights into Berlin up to that time, a symbol of the entire effort to date.&lt;ref name="miller1998_62-64"&gt;{{Harvnb|Miller|1998|pp=62–64}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cloud cover over Berlin dropped to the height of the buildings, and heavy rain showers made radar visibility poor. A C-54 crashed and burned at the end of the runway, and a second one landing behind it burst its tires while trying to avoid it. A third transport [[Ground loop (aviation)|ground looped]] after mistakenly landing on a runway under construction. In accordance with the standard procedures then in effect, all incoming transports including Tunner's, arriving every three minutes, were stacked above Berlin by [[air traffic control]] from {{convert|3000|ft}} to {{convert|12000|ft}} in bad weather, creating an extreme risk of mid-air collision. Newly unloaded planes were denied permission to take off to avoid that possibility and created a backup on the ground. While no one was killed, Tunner was embarrassed that the control tower at Tempelhof had lost control of the situation while the commander of the airlift was circling overhead. Tunner radioed for all stacked aircraft except his to be sent home immediately. This became known as "Black Friday," and Tunner personally noted it was from that date that the success of the airlift stemmed.&lt;ref name="rgm64"&gt;{{harvnb|Miller|1998|p=64}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="wht155"&gt;{{Harvnb|Tunner|1964|pp=153–55}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As a result of Black Friday, Tunner instituted a number of new rules; [[instrument flight rules]] (IFR) would be in effect at all times, regardless of actual visibility, and each [[sortie]] would have only one chance to land in Berlin, returning to its air base if it missed its approach, where it was slotted back into the flow. Stacking was completely eliminated. With straight-in approaches, the planners found that in the time it had taken to unstack and land nine aircraft, 30 aircraft could be landed, bringing in 300 tons.&lt;ref name="rgm65"&gt;{{harvnb|Miller|1998|p=65}}&lt;/ref&gt; Accident rates and delays dropped immediately. Tunner decided, as he had done during the Hump operation, to replace the C-47s in the airlift with C-54s or larger aircraft when it was realised that it took just as long to unload a 3.5-ton C-47 as a 10-ton C-54. One of the reasons for this was the sloping cargo floor of the [[Conventional landing gear|"taildragger"]] C-47s, which made truck loading difficult. The [[Tricycle landing gear|tricycle geared]] C-54's cargo deck was level, so that a truck could back up to it and offload cargo quickly. The change went into full effect after 28 September 1948.&lt;ref name="rgm63"&gt;{{harvnb|Miller|1998|p=63}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Having noticed on his first inspection trip to Berlin on 31 July that there were long delays as the flight crews returned to their aircraft after getting refreshments from the terminal, Tunner banned aircrew from leaving their aircraft for any reason while in Berlin. Instead, he equipped [[jeep#The origins of the vehicle: the first jeeps|jeeps]] as mobile [[snack bar]]s, handing out refreshments to the crews at their aircraft while it was being unloaded. [[Gail Halvorsen]] later noted, "he put some beautiful German [[Fräulein]]s in that snack bar. They knew we couldn't date them, we had no time. So they were very friendly."&lt;ref name=pbs/&gt; Operations officers handed pilots their clearance slips and other information while they ate. With unloading beginning as soon as engines were shut down on the ramp, turnaround before takeoff back to Rhein-Main or Wiesbaden was reduced to thirty minutes.&lt;ref name="wht171"&gt;{{Harvnb|Tunner|1964|p=164}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Sunderland 201 Sqn on Havel during Berlin Airlift 1948.jpg|thumb|An RAF [[Short Sunderland]] moored on the [[Havel]] near Berlin unloading salt during the airlift]]

To maximise the utilisation of a limited number of aircraft, Tunner altered the "ladder" to three minutes and {{convert|500|ft}} of separation, stacked from {{convert|4000|ft}} to {{convert|6000|ft}}.&lt;ref name="miller116"/&gt; Maintenance, particularly adherence to 25-hour, 200-hour, and 1,000-hour inspections, became the highest priority and further maximised utilisation.&lt;ref name="wht169"&gt;{{harvnb|Tunner|1964|p=169}}&lt;/ref&gt; Tunner also shortened block times to six hours to squeeze in another shift, making 1,440 (the number of minutes in a day) landings in Berlin a daily goal.&lt;ref group=nb&gt;It is interesting to contrast this with Military Airlift Command's hot-war requirements of only 1,600 sorties a day for all of Europe. See [https://books.google.com/books?id=dncFHOF1n2sC&amp;pg=PA213 "The Cognitive Dynamics of Computer Science"], John Wiley and Sons, 2006, p. 213&lt;/ref&gt; His purpose, illustrating his basic philosophy of the airlift business, was to create a "conveyor belt" approach to scheduling that could be sped up or slowed down as situations might dictate. The most effective measure taken by Tunner, and the most initially resisted until it demonstrated its efficiency, was creation of a single control point in the CALTF for controlling all air movements into Berlin, rather than each air force doing its own.

The Berliners themselves solved the problem of the lack of manpower. Crews unloading and making airfield repairs at the Berlin airports were made up of almost entirely by local civilians, who were given additional rations in return. As the crews increased in experience, the times for unloading continued to fall, with a record set for the unloading of an entire 10-ton shipment of coal from a C-54 in ten minutes, later beaten when a twelve-man crew unloaded the same quantity in five minutes and 45 seconds.

By the end of August 1948, after two months, the Airlift was succeeding; daily operations flew more than 1,500 flights a day and delivered more than 4,500 tons of cargo, enough to keep West Berlin supplied. From January 1949 onwards, 225 C-54s (40% of USAF and USN Skymasters worldwide)&lt;ref name="miller2000_93"/&gt; were devoted to the lift.&lt;ref name="rgm92"&gt;{{harvnb|Miller|1998|p=92}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref group=nb&gt;The figure of 225 Skymasters—201 from the Air Force and 24 from the Navy—represents only those in Germany at any one time. Another 75 were always in the maintenance pipeline (raised in April 1949 to 100), and 19 more were assigned to the airlift replacement training unit at [[Great Falls AFB]], Montana. At its maximum, 312 of the 441 USAF C-54s were committed to the airlift.&lt;/ref&gt; Supplies improved to 5,000 tons a day.

==="Operation Little Vittles"===
[[File:Gail-halvorsen-wiggly-wings.jpg|thumb|upright|left|US Air Force pilot [[Gail Halvorsen]], who pioneered the idea of dropping candy bars and bubble gum with handmade miniature parachutes, which later became known as "Operation Little Vittles"]]
[[Gail Halvorsen]], one of the many Airlift pilots, decided to use his off-time to fly into Berlin and make movies with his hand-held camera. He arrived at Tempelhof on 17 July 1948 on one of the C-54s and walked over to a crowd of children who had gathered at the end of the runway to watch the aircraft. He introduced himself and they started to ask him questions about the aircraft and their flights. As a goodwill gesture, he handed out his only two sticks of [[Wrigley Company|Wrigley's]] [[Doublemint]] Gum. The children quickly divided up the pieces as best they could, even passing around the wrapper for others to smell. He was so impressed by their gratitude and that they didn't fight over them, that he promised the next time he returned he would drop off more. Before he left them, a child asked him how they would know it was him flying over. He replied, "I'll wiggle my wings."&lt;ref name=spirit /&gt;

[[File:C-54 dropping candy during Berlin Airlift c1949.jpg|thumb|A [[Douglas C-54 Skymaster]] dropping candy over Berlin, c. 1948/49]]
The next day on his approach to Berlin, he rocked the aircraft and dropped some chocolate bars attached to a handkerchief parachute to the children waiting below. Every day after that, the number of children increased and he made several more drops. Soon, there was a stack of mail in Base Ops addressed to "Uncle Wiggly Wings", "The Chocolate Uncle" and "The Chocolate Flier". His commanding officer was upset when the story appeared in the news, but when Tunner heard about it, he approved of the gesture and immediately expanded it into "Operation Little Vittles". Other pilots participated, and when news reached the US, children all over the country sent in their own candy to help out. Soon, major candy manufacturers joined in. In the end, over twenty three tons of candy were dropped on Berlin&lt;ref name=spirit /&gt; and the "operation" became a major propaganda success. German children christened the candy-dropping aircraft "[[raisin bombers]]".&lt;ref&gt;Smoler, Fredric (April/May 2003).

==Soviet responses==
The Soviets had an advantage in conventional military forces, but were preoccupied with rebuilding their war-torn economy and society. The US had a stronger navy and air force, and had nuclear weapons. Neither side wanted a war; the Soviets did not disrupt the airlift.&lt;ref&gt;Michael Laird, "Wars averted: Chanak 1922, Burma 1945–47, Berlin 1948." ''Journal of Strategic Studies'' (1996) 19#3 pp. 343–64.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Initial reaction===
As the tempo of the Airlift grew, it became apparent that the Western powers might be able to pull off the impossible: indefinitely supplying an entire city by air alone. In response, starting on 1 August 1948, the Soviets offered free food to anyone who crossed into East Berlin and registered their [[ration card]]s there, but West Berliners overwhelmingly rejected Soviet offers of food.&lt;ref name="turner29"/&gt;

Throughout the airlift, Soviet and German communists subjected the hard-pressed West Berliners to sustained psychological warfare.&lt;ref name="turner29"&gt;{{Harvnb|Turner|1987|p=29}}&lt;/ref&gt; In radio broadcasts, they relentlessly proclaimed that all Berlin came under Soviet authority and predicted the imminent abandonment of the city by the Western occupying powers.&lt;ref name="turner29"/&gt; The Soviets also harassed members of the democratically elected citywide administration, which had to conduct its business in the city hall located in the Soviet sector.&lt;ref name="turner29"/&gt;

During the early months of the airlift, the Soviets used various methods to harass allied aircraft. These included buzzing by Soviet planes, obstructive parachute jumps within the corridors, and shining searchlights to dazzle pilots at night. Although the [[USAFE]] reported 733 separate harassing events, including [[Anti-aircraft warfare|flak]], air-to-air fire, rocketing, bombing, and explosions, this is now considered to be exaggerated. None of these measures were effective.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Cherny|2008|pp=129–30}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Canwell|2008|p=200}}&lt;/ref&gt; Former RAF Dakota pilot Dick Arscott described one "buzzing" incident. "[[Yakovlev Yak-3|Yaks]] (Soviet plane) used to come and buzz you and go over the top of you at about twenty feet which can be off putting. One day I was buzzed about three times. The following day it started again and he came across twice and I got a bit fed up with it. So when he came for the third time, I turned the aircraft into him and it was a case of chicken, luckily he was the one who chickened out." &lt;ref&gt;BBC Radio 4 programme "The Reunion, The Berlin Airlift", first broadcast 22 August 2014&lt;/ref&gt;

===Attempted Communist ''putsch'' in the municipal government===
In the autumn of 1948 it became impossible for the non-Communist majority in Greater Berlin's citywide parliament to attend sessions at city hall within the Soviet sector.&lt;ref name="turner29"/&gt; The parliament (''Stadtverordnetenversammlung von Groß-Berlin'') had been elected under the provisional constitution of Berlin two years earlier (20 October 1946). As [[Socialist Unity Party of Germany|SED]]-controlled policemen looked on passively, Communist-led mobs repeatedly invaded the ''Neues Stadthaus'', the provisional city hall (located on Parochialstraße since all other central municipal buildings had been destroyed in the War), interrupted the parliament's sessions, and physically menaced its non-Communist members.&lt;ref name="turner29"/&gt; The Kremlin organised an attempted [[putsch]] for control of all of Berlin through a 6 September takeover of the city hall by SED members.&lt;ref name="wettig173"&gt;{{Harvnb|Wettig|2008|p=173}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Three days later [[Radio in the American Sector|RIAS Radio]] urged Berliners to protest against the actions of the communists. On 9 September 1948 a crowd of 500,000 people gathered at the [[Brandenburg Gate]], next to the ruined [[Reichstag building|Reichstag]] in the British sector. The Airlift was working so far, but many West Berliners feared that the Allies would eventually discontinue it. Then-[[Social Democratic Party of Germany|SPD]] city councillor [[Ernst Reuter]] took the microphone and pleaded for his city, "You peoples of the world, you people of America, of England, of France, look on this city, and recognise that this city, this people, must not be abandoned—cannot be abandoned!".&lt;ref name=pbs/&gt;

The crowd surged towards the Soviet-occupied sector and someone climbed up and ripped down the Soviet flag flying from atop the Brandenburg Gate. Soviet military police (MPs) quickly responded, resulted in the killing of one in the unruly crowd.&lt;ref name=pbs/&gt; The tense situation could have escalated further and ended up in more bloodshed but a British deputy [[Provost (military police)|provost]] then intervened and pointedly pushed the Soviet MPs back with his [[swagger stick]].&lt;ref&gt;MacDonogh, G "After the Reich" John Murray London 2007 p. 533&lt;/ref&gt; Never before this incident had so many Berliners gathered in unity. The resonance worldwide was enormous, notably in the United States, where a strong feeling of solidarity with Berliners reinforced a general widespread determination not to abandon them.&lt;ref name="wettig173"/&gt;

Berlin's parliament decided to meet instead in the canteen of the [[Technical University of Berlin|Technical College of Berlin-Charlottenburg]] in the British sector, boycotted by the members of SED, which had gained 19.8% of the electoral votes in 1946. On 30 November 1948 the SED gathered its elected parliament members and 1,100 further activists and held an unconstitutional so-called "extraordinary city assembly" (''außerordentliche Stadtverordnetenversammlung'') in East Berlin's Metropol-Theater which declared the elected city government (''Magistrat'') and its democratically-elected city councillors to be deposed and replaced it with a new one led by [[Oberbürgermeister]] [[Friedrich Ebert junior|Friedrich Ebert Jr.]] and consisting only of Communists.&lt;ref name="wettig173"/&gt; This arbitrary act had no legal effect in West Berlin, but the Soviet occupants prevented the elected city government for all of Berlin from further acting in the eastern sector.

===December elections===
The city parliament, boycotted by its SED members, then voted for its re-election on 5 December 1948, however, inhibited in the eastern sector and defamed by the SED as a ''Spalterwahl'' ("divisive election"). The SED did not nominate any candidates for this election and appealed to the electorate in the western sectors to boycott the election, while the democratic parties ran for seats. The turnout amounted to 86.3% of the western electorate with the [[Social Democratic Party of Germany|SPD]] gaining 64.5% of the votes (= 76 seats), the [[Christian Democratic Union (Germany)|CDU]] 19.4% (= 26 seats), and the Liberal-Demokratische Partei (LDP, merged in the [[Free Democratic Party (Germany)|FDP]] in 1949) 16.1% (= 17 seats).&lt;ref name="turner29"/&gt;

On 7 December the new, ''de facto'' West-Berlin-only city parliament elected a new city government in West Berlin headed by [[Ernst Reuter|Lord Mayor Reuter]], who had already once been elected lord mayor in early 1946 but prevented from taking office by a Soviet veto.&lt;ref name="wettig173"/&gt; Thus two separate city governments officiated in the city divided into East and West versions of its former self. In the east, a communist system supervised by house, street, and block wardens was quickly implemented.

West Berlin's parliament accounted for the ''de facto'' political partition of Berlin and replaced the provisional constitution of Berlin by the ''Verfassung von Berlin'' (constitution of Berlin), meant for all Berlin, with effect of 1 October 1950 and ''de facto'' restricted to the western sectors only, also renaming city parliament (from ''Stadtverordnetenversammlung von Groß-Berlin'' to ''[[Abgeordnetenhaus von Berlin]]''), city government (from ''Magistrat von Groß-Berlin'' to [[Senate of Berlin]]), and head of government (from ''Oberbürgermeister'' to [[Governing Mayor of Berlin]]).&lt;ref&gt;Cf. articles 25 and 40 of ''Die Verfassung von Berlin'' (Constitution of Berlin [West]), Berlin (West): Landeszentrale für politische Bildungsarbeit Berlin, 1982, pp. 34, 37.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Winter 1948 to spring 1949==
{{refimprove section|date=June 2011}}

===Preparing for winter===
Although the early estimates were that about 4,000 to 5,000 tons per day would be needed to supply the city, this was made in the context of summer weather, when the Airlift was only expected to last a few weeks. As the operation dragged on into autumn, the situation changed considerably. The food requirements would remain the same (around 1,500 tons), but the need for additional coal to heat the city dramatically increased the total amount of cargo to be transported by an additional 6,000 tons a day.

To maintain the Airlift under these conditions, the current system would have to be greatly expanded. Aircraft were available, and the British started adding their larger [[Handley Page Hastings]] in November, but maintaining the fleet proved to be a serious problem. Tunner looked to the Germans once again, hiring (plentiful) ex-[[Luftwaffe]] ground crews.
[[File:Wiesbaden Air Base during Berlin Airlift 1949.jpg|thumb|C-54s stand out against the snow at Wiesbaden Air Base during the Berlin Airlift in the Winter of 1948–49]]

Another problem was the lack of runways in Berlin to land on: two at Tempelhof and one at Gatow—neither of which was designed to support the loads the C-54s were putting on them. All of the existing runways required hundreds of labourers, who ran onto them between landings and dumped sand into the runway's [[Marston Mat]] (pierced steel planking) to soften the surface and help the planking survive. Since this system could not endure through the winter, between July and September 1948 a 6,000&amp;nbsp;ft.-long asphalt runway was constructed at Tempelhof.

Far from ideal, with the approach being over Berlin's apartment blocks, the runway nevertheless was a major upgrade to the airport's capabilities. With it in place, the auxiliary runway was upgraded from Marston Matting to asphalt between September and October 1948. A similar upgrade program was carried out by the British at Gatow during the same period, also adding a second runway, using concrete.

The [[French Air Force]], meanwhile, had become involved in the [[First Indochina War]], so it could only bring up some old [[Junkers Ju 52]]s to support its own troops and they were too small and slow to be of much help. However, France agreed to build a complete, new and larger airport in its sector on the shores of [[Lake Tegel]]. French military engineers, managing German construction crews, were able to complete the construction in under 90 days. The airport was mostly built by hand, by thousands of mostly female labourers who worked day and night.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Roger G. Miller|title=To Save a City: The Berlin Airlift, 1948–1949|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=PC26jfegblgC|year=2008|publisher=Texas A&amp;M University Press|pages=110–11|isbn=9781603440905}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Heavy equipment was needed to level the ground, equipment that was too large and heavy to fly in on any existing cargo aircraft. The solution was to dismantle large machines and then re-assemble them. Using the five largest American [[Fairchild C-82 Packet|C-82 Packet]] transports, it was possible to fly the machinery into West Berlin. This not only helped to build the airfield, but also demonstrated that the Soviet blockade could not keep anything out of Berlin. The Tegel airfield was subsequently developed into [[Berlin Tegel Airport]].

To improve air traffic control, which would be critical as the number of flights grew, the newly developed Ground Controlled Approach radar system ([[Ground-controlled approach|GCA]]) was flown to Europe for installation at Tempelhof, with a second set installed at Fassberg in the British Zone in West Germany. With the installation of GCA, all-weather airlift operations were assured.

None of these efforts could fix the weather, which became the biggest problem. November and December 1948 proved to be the worst months of the airlift operation. One of the longest-lasting fogs ever experienced in Berlin blanketed the entire European continent for weeks. All too often, aircraft would make the entire flight and then be unable to land in Berlin. On 20 November 1948, 42 aircraft departed for Berlin, but only one landed there. At one point, the city had only a week's supply of coal left. However, the weather eventually improved, and more than 171,000 tons were delivered in January 1949, 152,000 tons in February, and 196,223 tons in March.&lt;ref name=indiana/&gt;

===Easter parade===
By April 1949, airlift operations were running smoothly and Tunner wanted to shake up his command to discourage complacency. He believed in the spirit of competition between units and, coupled with the idea of a big event, felt that this would encourage them to greater efforts. He decided that, on Easter Sunday, the airlift would break all records. To do this, maximum efficiency was needed and so, to simplify cargo-handling, only coal would be airlifted. Coal stockpiles were built up for the effort and maintenance schedules were altered so that the maximum number of aircraft were available.&lt;ref name="wht222"&gt;{{harvnb|Tunner|1964|pp=219–22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

From noon on 15 April to noon on 16 April 1949, crews worked around the clock. When it was over, 12,941 tons of coal had been delivered in 1,383 flights, without a single accident.&lt;ref name="wht222"/&gt; A welcome side effect of the effort was that operations in general were boosted, and tonnage increased from 6,729 tons to 8,893 tons per day thereafter. In total, the airlift delivered 234,476 tons in April.&lt;ref name=indiana/&gt;

On 21 April, the tonnage of supplies flown into the city exceeded that previously brought by rail.{{citation needed|date=September 2016}}

==End of the blockade==
[[File:InschriftLuftbruckendenkmal.JPG|thumb|Berlin Airlift Monument in Berlin-Tempelhof with inscription "They gave their lives for the freedom of Berlin in service of the Berlin Airlift 1948/49"]]
On 15 April 1949, the Soviet news agency [[TASS]] reported a willingness by the Soviets to lift the blockade. The next day, the [[United States Department of State|US State Department]] stated that the "way appears clear" for the blockade to end. Soon afterwards, the four powers began serious negotiations, and a settlement was reached on Western terms. On 4 May 1949, the Allies announced an agreement to end the blockade in eight days.

[[File:Berlin Tempelhof Luftbrueckendenkmal.jpg|thumb|upright|Berlin Airlift Monument in Berlin-Tempelhof, displaying the names of the 39 British and 31 American airmen who lost their lives during the operation. Similar monuments can be found at the military airfield of Wietzenbruch near the former [[Celle Air Base|RAF Celle]] and at [[Rhein-Main Air Base]].]]

The Soviet blockade of Berlin was lifted at one minute after midnight on 12 May 1949.&lt;ref name="turner27"&gt;{{Harvnb|Turner|1987|p=27}}&lt;/ref&gt; A British convoy immediately drove through to Berlin, and the first train from West Germany reached Berlin at 5:32&amp;nbsp;A.M. Later that day, an enormous crowd celebrated the end of the blockade. General Clay, whose retirement had been announced by US President [[Harry S. Truman|Truman]] on 3 May 1949, was saluted by 11,000 US soldiers and dozens of aircraft. Once home, Clay received a [[ticker tape parade]] in New York City, was invited to address the [[United States Congress|US Congress]], and was honoured with a medal from President Truman.

Nevertheless, supply flights to Berlin continued for some time to build up a comfortable surplus, though night flying and then weekend flights could be eliminated once the surplus was large enough. By 24 July 1949, three months' worth of supplies had been amassed, ensuring that there was ample time to restart the Airlift if needed.

On 18 August 1949, Flt Lt Roy Mather DFC AFC and his crew of Flt Lt Roy Lewis Stewart Hathaway AFC, Flt Lt Richardson and Royston William Marshall AFM of 206 squadron, flew back to Wunstorf for the 404th time during the blockade, the record number of flights for any pilot of any nationality, either civilian or military.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.vickersvaliant.com/berlin-airlift.html&lt;/ref&gt;

The Berlin Airlift officially ended on 30 September 1949, after fifteen months. In total, the USAF delivered 1,783,573 tons and the RAF 541,937 tons,&lt;ref group=nb&gt;A fleet of 104 varied transports from 25 civilian companies was integrated into Operation Plainfare and brought in 146,980 tons or 27% of the RAF tonnage. (Miller 1998 p. 40)&lt;/ref&gt; totalling 2,326,406 tons, nearly two-thirds of which was coal, on 278,228 flights to Berlin.&lt;ref name="tine"/&gt; The [[Royal Australian Air Force]] delivered 7,968 tons of freight and 6,964 passengers during 2,062 sorties. The C-47s and C-54s together flew over 92 million miles in the process, almost the [[Astronomical unit|distance from Earth to the Sun]].&lt;ref name="tine"&gt;[http://www.almc.army.mil/ALOG/issues/SepOct05/Berlinairlift.html ''Berlin Airlift: Logistics, Humanitarian Aid, and Strategic Success''], Major Gregory C.

A total of 101 fatalities were recorded as a result of the operation, including 40 [[British people|Britons]] and 31 Americans,&lt;ref name="turner27"/&gt; mostly due to non-flying accidents.&lt;ref name="wht218"&gt;{{Harvnb|Tunner|1964|p=218}}&lt;/ref&gt; One [[Royal Australian Air Force]] member was killed in an aircraft crash at Lubeck while attached to [[No. 27 Squadron RAF]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://airpower.airforce.gov.au/APDC/media/OAFH-Images/Snippet_11.pdf |title = RAAF Participation in Berlin Airlift 1948–49 – Operation Pelican  |accessdate =5 Jan 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Seventeen American and eight British aircraft crashed during the operation.

The cost of the Airlift was shared between the US, UK, and Germany. Estimated costs range from approximately US$224&amp;nbsp;million&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.german-way.com/airlift.html |title = The Berlin Airlift – Die Luftbrücke 1948–49  |accessdate =24 June 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; to over US$500&amp;nbsp;million (equivalent to approximately ${{formatprice|{{inflation|US|224000000|1949}}}} to ${{formatprice|{{inflation|US|500000000|1949}}}} now).{{inflation-fn|US}}&lt;ref name="nationalcoldwarexhibition.org"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.epw.in/system/files/pdf/1949_1/8/british_exports_facing_german_competition.pdf Occupation of Germany, including the Berlin air lift, cost the UK taxpayer £35 million in 1948]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Subsequent events==
Operational control of the three Allied air corridors was assigned to BARTCC (Berlin Air Route Traffic Control Center) air traffic control located at [[Tempelhof]]. Diplomatic approval was granted by a four-power organisation called the [[Berlin Air Safety Center]], also located in the American sector.

Tegel was developed into West Berlin's principal airport. In 2007, it was joined by a re-developed [[Berlin-Schönefeld International Airport]] in Brandenburg. As a result of the development of these two airports, [[Berlin Tempelhof Airport|Tempelhof]] was closed in October 2008,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|first=Christina|last=Hebel|title=An Era Ends with Closing of Berlin Airport

During the 1970s and 1980s Schönefeld had its own crossing points through the [[Berlin Wall]] and communist fortifications for western citizens.

The Soviets' contravention by the blockade of the agreement reached by the [[London 6-Power Conference]], and the [[Czechoslovak coup d'état of 1948]], convinced Western leaders that they had to take swift and decisive measures to strengthen the portions of Germany not occupied by the Soviets.&lt;ref name="turner27"/&gt;.

The US, British and French authorities also agreed to replace their military administrations in their occupation zones with [[High Commissioner]]s operating within the terms of a three-power occupation statute.&lt;ref name="turner28"&gt;{{Harvnb|Turner|1987|p=28}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Blockade also helped to unify German politicians in these zones in support of the creation of a West German state; some of them had hitherto been fearful of Soviet opposition.&lt;ref name="turner28"/&gt; The blockade also increased the perception among many Europeans that the Soviets posed a danger, helping to prompt the entry into [[NATO]] of Portugal, Iceland, Italy, Denmark, and Norway.&lt;ref name="wettig174"&gt;{{Harvnb|Wettig|2008|p=174}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Animosities between Germans and the Western Allies—Britain, France, and the United States—were greatly reduced by the airlift, with the former enemies recognising common interests, namely freedom and capitalism, shared values and mutual respect.&lt;ref name="turner30"&gt;{{Harvnb|Turner|1987|p=30}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although this may have just been a "The Enemy of my Enemy is my Friend" situation seeing as only a couple of years earlier Soviet forces had ravaged the city.&lt;ref&gt;"BBC - History - World Wars: The Battle For Berlin In World War Two." Bbc.co.uk. N. p., 2018. Web. 27 Sept. 2018.&lt;/ref&gt; The Soviets refused to return to the Allied Control Council in Berlin, rendering the four-power occupation authority set up at the Potsdam Conference useless.&lt;ref name="turner27"/&gt; It has been argued that the events of the Berlin Blockade are proof that the Allies conducted their affairs within a rational framework, since they were keen to avoid war.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Lewkowicz|2008|}}{{Page needed|date=September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the early days, the Americans used their [[Douglas C-47 Skytrain|C-47 Skytrain]] or its civilian counterpart [[Douglas DC-3]]. These machines could carry a payload of up to 3.5 tons, but were replaced by [[Douglas C-54 Skymaster|C-54 Skymasters]] and [[Douglas DC-4]]s, which could carry up to 10 tons and were faster. These made up a total of 330 aircraft, which made them the most used types. Other American aircraft such as the five [[Fairchild C-82 Packet|C-82 Packets]], and the one [[Boeing C-97 Stratofreighter|YC-97A Stratofreighter]] 45-59595, with a payload of 20 tons—a gigantic load for that time—were only sparsely used.

The British used a considerable variety of aircraft types. Many aircraft were either former bombers or civil versions of bombers. In the absence of enough transports, the British chartered many civilian aircraft. [[British European Airways]] (BEA) coordinated all British civil aircraft operations. Apart from BEA itself, the participating airlines included [[British Overseas Airways Corporation]] (BOAC) and most British independent&lt;ref group=nb&gt;independent from [[government-owned corporation]]s&lt;/ref&gt; airlines of that era—e.g. [[British Eagle#Formation and early operations|Eagle Aviation]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.britisheagle.net/G-ALEF-Pic-1.html ''"The Home Of Eagle"'' ... – Berlin Airlift commemorative stamp depicting Handley Page 61 Halifax 8 G-ALEF ''Red Eagle'' (c/n 1399)]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Silver City Airways]], [[British South American Airways]] (BSAA), the Lancashire Aircraft Corporation, [[Airwork Services#Airline operations|Airwork]], [[Airflight|Air Flight]], [[Aquila Airways]], [[Cobham plc|Flight Refuelling Ltd]] (which used their Lancaster tankers to deliver aviation fuel), [[Skyways Limited#Early operations|Skyways]], [[Scottish Airlines]] and Ciro's Aviation.

Altogether, BEA was responsible to the RAF for the direction and operation of 25 British airlines taking part in "Operation Plainfare".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.flightglobal.com/pdfarchive/view/1968/1968%20-%202530.html ''One-Eleven 500 into service ...'', Flight International, 7 November 1968, p. 742]&lt;/ref&gt; The British also used flying boats, particularly for transporting corrosive salt. These included civilian aircraft operated by Aquila Airways.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Eglin|Ritchie|1980|pp=14–19}}&lt;/ref&gt; These took off and landed on water and were designed to be corrosion-resistant. In winter, when ice covered the Berlin rivers and made the use of flying boats difficult, the British used other aircraft in their place.

Altogether, a total of 692 aircraft were engaged in the Berlin Airlift, more than 100 of which belonged to civilian operators.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Eglin|Ritchie|1980|p=17}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Other aircraft included [[Junkers Ju 52]]/3m which were operated briefly by France.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1621">The '''Bodø affair''' was a diplomatic scandal{{clarify|date=January 2014}} involving [[Union between Sweden and Norway|Sweden-Norway]] (then a [[dual monarchy]]) and the [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland|United Kingdom]], which lasted from 1818 to 1821. The affair arose over the illegal trading activities of an English company in the Norwegian port of [[Bodø]], where Norwegian officials in 1818 seized a large cargo belonging to the company and arrested one of its owners, who later escaped. The [[Stockholm]] foreign ministry, which handled the foreign affairs of Norway at that time, seemed unreasonably favorable to British claims over the Bodø incident, thereby angering Norwegians and arousing their [[nationalism]]. In 1821 compensation was paid to the British company over Norwegian objections. While of minor importance in itself, the incident led to a lasting distrust among Norwegians of the Swedish foreign ministry.&lt;ref&gt;Bodø Affair. (2009). In [[Encyclopædia Britannica]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6512">'''Cat burning''' was a form of  entertainment in [[France]] prior to the 1800s. In this form of entertainment, people would gather dozens of [[cat]]s in a net and hoist them high into the air from a special bundle onto a [[bonfire]] causing [[Death by burning|death]] through the effects of [[combustion]], or effects of exposure to extreme heat. In the [[medieval]] and [[early modern]] periods, cats, which were associated with [[vanity]] and [[witchcraft]], were sometimes burned as symbols of the [[Devil]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | last= Benton | first= Janetta Rebold | authorlink= | coauthors= | title= Holy Terrors: Gargoyles on Medieval Buildings | publisher= Abbeville Press | date= 1 April 1997 | location= | pages= 82 | url= | doi= | id= | isbn= 978-0-7892-0182-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Descriptions==
According to [[Norman Davies]], the assembled people "shrieked with laughter as the animals, howling with pain, were singed, roasted, and finally [[Carbonization|carbonized]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Davies|first=Norman|title=Europe: a History|year=1996|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=|isbn=0-198-20171-0|pages=543}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[James Frazer]] wrote: "It was the custom to burn a basket, barrel, or sack full of live cats, which was hung from a tall mast in the midst of the bonfire; sometimes a [[fox]] was burned. The people collected the embers and ashes of the fire and took them home, believing that they brought good luck. The French kings often witnessed these spectacles and even lit the bonfire with their own hands. In 1648 [[Louis XIV]], crowned with a wreath of roses and carrying a bunch of roses in his hand, kindled the fire, danced at it and partook of the banquet afterwards in the town hall. But this was the last occasion when a monarch presided at the midsummer bonfire in Paris. At [[Metz]] midsummer fires were lighted with great pomp on the esplanade, and a dozen cats, enclosed in [[wicker]] cages, were burned alive in them, to the amusement of the people. Similarly at [[Gap, Hautes-Alpes|Gap]], in the [[Departments of France|department]] of the [[Hautes-Alpes]], cats used to be roasted over the midsummer bonfire."&lt;ref&gt;[[James Frazer|Frazer, Sir James George]]. ''The Golden Bough'', (1922). [http://www.bartleby.com/196/164.html Online version.]&lt;/ref&gt;

Cat-burning was also described in ''[[The Great Cat Massacre]]'', a scholarly work by American historian [[Robert Darnton]]:
&lt;blockquote&gt;Cats also figured in the cycle of Saint John the Baptist, which took place on June 24, at the time of summer solstice. Crowds made bonfires, jumped over them, danced around them, and threw into them objects with magical power, hoping to avoid disaster and obtain good fortune during the rest of the year. A favorite object was cats—cats tied up in bags, cats suspended from ropes, or cats burned at stake. Parisians liked to incinerate cats by the sackful, while the Courimauds (or "cour à miaud" or cat chasers) of Saint Chamond preferred to chase a flaming cat through the streets. In parts of Burgundy and Lorraine they danced around a kind of burning May pole with a cat tied to it. In the Metz region they burned a dozen cats at a time in a basket on top of a bonfire. The ceremony took place with great pomp in Metz itself, until it was abolished in 1765. ...&amp;nbsp;Although the practice varied from place to place, the ingredients were everywhere the same: a "feu de joie" (bonfire), cats, and an aura of hilarious witch-hunting. Wherever the scent of burning felines could be found, a smile was sure to follow.&lt;ref name="Cat Massacre"&gt;{{cite book|last=Darnton|first=Robert|title=The Great Cat Massacre: And Other Episodes in French Cultural History|year=2009|publisher=Basic Books|location=|isbn=0-465-01274-4|pages=83–84|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=f-taE3FLTlMC&amp;pg=PA83}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Cat-burning was the subject of a 1758 text from the Benedictine Dom Jean François, ''Dissertation sur l’ancien usage des feux de la Saint-Jean, et d’y brûler les chats à Metz'', recently published.&lt;ref name="Dissertation"&gt;{{cite book|last=Mangin|first=Marie-Claire|title=Dissertation sur l’ancien usage des feux de la Saint-Jean, et d’y brûler les chats à Metz, un inédit de dom Jean François|publisher=Cahiers Élie Fleur|year=1995|pages=49–72|url=http://www.sudoc.fr/114652155}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Jean Meslier]], a French Catholic priest who privately held atheist views, briefly mentioned the practice of cat burning in his ''Testament'' as follows:
&lt;blockquote&gt;Among other things, these mischievous, brutal madmen make [the cats] cruelly suffer harsh and violent tortures in their entertainments and even in public celebrations; they tie up nipping cats to the end of some pole they set up and at the bottom of which they light the fires of joy where they burn them alive to have the pleasure of seeing the violent movements and hearing the frightening cries that these poor unfortunate beasts are forced to make because of the harshness and violence of the tortures.&lt;ref name="Meslier"&gt;{{cite book|last=Meslier|first=Jean|title=Testament: Memoir of the thoughts and sentiments of Jean Meslier|year=2009|publisher=Prometheus Books|location=Amherst, N.Y.|isbn=978-1-59102-749-2|pages=562–563}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Meslier largely attributed these customs to [[Cartesianism|Cartesian philosophy]], wherein non-human animals were viewed as possessing no soul, and thus, no sentience.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Kemerling|first=Garth|title=Descartes: A New Approach|url=http://www.wisdomworld.org/additional/ExtensionsOfEvidence-Series/DescartesAndTheSoul.html|work=Philosophy Pages|accessdate=16 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; He posited that this "tends to stifle in the heart of man all feelings of gentleness, kindness, and compassion that they may have for beasts&amp;nbsp;..."&lt;ref name="Meslier" /&gt;

{{nihongo|'''''Cesare il creatore che ha distrutto'''''|チェーザレ 破壊の創造者|Chezare Hakai no Sōzō-sha|lit. "Cesare, the Destroyer Creator"|lead=yes}} is a [[manga]] series by [[Souryo Fuyumi]], serialized in the Japanese monthly comic magazine ''Morning'' and published in [[tankōbon]] format by ''Kodansha''.  The first volume was published in 2005 and there have been 11 volumes published in [[Japan]] so far (as of 2017).  The series is currently ongoing in ''Morning''. One of Souryo's other works, ''[[ES (Eternal Sabbath)|Eternal Sabbath]]'', was also serialized by the same magazine. Since October 2014, the manga has been on a hiatus, but returns to monthly publishing in November 2018.
&lt;ref&gt;https://www.animenewsnetwork.com/news/2018-11-15/fuyumi-soryo-resumes-cesare-manga-after-4-year-hiatus/.139519&lt;/ref&gt;
In creating ''Cesare'', Souryo has collaborated with a Dante scholar to bring to life a vivid portrait of Renaissance Italy in great and accurate detail.

==Series summary==
Cesare is about the life of one of history's most enigmatic figures, [[Cesare Borgia]], an [[Aristocracy (class)|aristocrat]] during the [[Renaissance|Renaissance Italy]].  The [[manga]] takes an intimate look at Cesare's life during his matriculation at the [[University of Pisa]], at the age of 15, in the years preceding his appointment as a [[cardinal (Catholicism)|cardinal]] of the [[Holy See]].

==Characters==
'''[[Cesare Borgia]]''': Installed at Pisa by his father [[Rodrigo Borgia]], a [[cardinal (Catholicism)|cardinal]], purportedly to earn his doctorate in theology. However, it is soon made obvious that Cesare's presence in Pisa is engineered by his father in order to support the rise of the Borgia family in power and the impending ascension of Rodrigo Borgia to the [[Pope|papacy]].

'''[[Michelotto Corella|Michelotto da Corella]]''': Cesare's faithful right-hand man. An orphaned [[Sephardi Jews|Sephardi Jew]] who was taken into Rodrigo Borgia's household, and of an age with Cesare.

'''Angelo da Canossa''': A new student at Pisa, Angelo proves to be a fish out of water. Having lived a sheltered life with his grandfather in a remote province, he retains a social clumsiness that gets him in trouble at his first day in school. It is only through Cesare's timely intervention that Angelo begins to realize his awkward and lackadaisical upbringing. It is through the eyes of Angelo that we primarily learn Cesare's multifaceted motivations and the beginnings of his ambitions.

==Other characters==

Cesare's life and world overlaps with the politics of his father and his father's allies and enemies.

'''[[Rodrigo Borgia]]''': The Borgias, who were based in Valencia, Spain, were known to be ruthless in the pursuit of their ambitions. Although a cardinal of the [[Roman Catholic Church]], and by rule forbidden to marry or have children due to the [[vow of celibacy|clerical vow of celibacy]], he acknowledged Cesare as well as some of his illegitimate children and used their talents to perpetuate the power of the Borgias throughout Europe and support him in his rise as Pope Alexander VI.

'''[[Giuliano della Rovere]]''': A cardinal and chief rival of Rodrigo Borgia for the papacy. Related to the [[Pazzi|Pazzi Conspiracy]], of which a prominent member of the Medici family was murdered. He is a real [[Pope Julius II|historical figure]].

'''[[Raffaele Riario]]''': Related to the Roveres through ties of marriage, he is allegedly one of Guiliano's supporters and a key conspirator in the [[Pazzi|Pazzi Conspiracy]]. He is also a real [[Raffaele Riario|historical figure]].

'''[[Lorenzo de' Medici]]''': A wealthy Italian statesman. He is a patron of scholars, artists, and poets. Such was his role for Angelo da Canossa's grandfather, a sculptor. Angelo's tuition at the University of Pisa was likewise sponsored by Lorenzo de' Medici. He is also a real [[Lorenzo de' Medici|historical figure]].

'''[[Girolamo Savonarola]]''': An Italian Dominican priest who harbors great enmity toward the Medicis and the Borgias. He is also a real [[Savonarola|historical figure]].

A '''crayfish party''' is a traditional summertime eating and drinking celebration in the [[Nordic countries]]. The tradition originated in [[Sweden]], where a crayfish party is called a ''{{lang|sv|kräftskiva}}''. The tradition has also spread to [[Finland]] via [[Swedish-speaking population of Finland|its Swedish-speaking population]].&lt;ref name="Finland"&gt;{{cite web |publisher=Finnguide |url=http://www.finnguide.fi/calendar/calendarevents.asp?month=8&amp;p=61 |title=Finnish Crayfish Party |accessdate=January 31, 2006 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060310102351/http://www.finnguide.fi/calendar/calendarevents.asp?month=8&amp;p=61 |archivedate=March 10, 2006 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; A similar tradition exists in the [[Baltic countries]] in particular in Lithuania and Latvia.

Crayfish parties are generally held during August, a tradition that began because the [[crayfish]] harvest in Sweden was, for most of the 20th century, legally limited to the late summer.&lt;ref name="Sweden"&gt;{{cite web |author=Po Tidhom |year=2004 |url=http://www.sweden.se/templates/cs/CommonPage____11371.aspx |title=The Crayfish Party |publisher=The Swedish Institute |accessdate=January 29, 2006 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090204020249/http://www.sweden.se/templates/cs/CommonPage____11371.aspx |archivedate=February 4, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nowadays, the ''{{lang|sv|kräftpremiär}}'' date in early August has no legal significance. Dining traditionally takes place outdoors, but in practice the party often takes refuge indoors due to the bad weather or aggressive [[mosquito]]es. Customary party accessories are novelty paper hats, paper tablecloths, paper lanterns (often depicting the [[Man in the Moon]]), and bibs.&lt;ref name="Sweden"/&gt; A rowdy atmosphere prevails amid noisy eating and traditional drinking songs (''{{lang|sv|[[snapsvisa]]}}''). Alcohol consumption is often high, especially when compared to the amount of food actually consumed. It is considered customary to suck the juice out of the crayfish before shelling it.&lt;ref name="Sweden"/&gt;

[[File:Kr%C3%A4ftskiva-1.jpg|thumb|upright=1.2|Man in the Moon Decoration]]

''{{lang|sv|[[Akvavit]]}}'' and other kinds of ''{{lang|sv|[[snaps]]}}'' are served, as well as [[beer]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Christina Johansson Robinowitz &amp; Lisa Werner Carr |title=Modern-Day Vikings: A Practical Guide to Interacting with the Swedes |publisher=Intercultural Press |year=2001 |isbn=1-877864-88-9 |page=123 |url=https://books.google.com/books?ie=UTF-8&amp;hl=en&amp;vid=ISBN1877864889&amp;id=MAn641nHfrYC&amp;pg=PA123}}&lt;/ref&gt; The crayfish are boiled in salt water and seasoned with fresh [[dill]] – preferably "crown dill" harvested after the plant has flowered – then served cold and eaten with the fingers. [[Bread]], [[mushroom]] pies, [[surströmming]], strong [[Västerbotten cheese]], salads and other dishes are served buffet-style.&lt;ref name="Sweden"/&gt;

==Spain==
For more than 40 years, the town of [[Herrera de Pisuerga]] ([[Province of Palencia]]) has celebrated the ''{{lang|sv|Festival Nacional del Cangrejo de río}}'' (Crayfish's National Festival). This is because this crustacean has been always part of the traditional gastronomy of the area. Since 2011, the town includes a "Swedish dinner" in its celebrations, during which the residents practice the Swedish tradition of a street dinner with paper lanterns and candles in true ''{{lang|sv|kräftskiva}}''-style. For the inaugural Swedish dinner, the festival was honoured by the presence of a special guest, the First Secretary and Chancellor of Spain, Ms Eva Boix.&lt;ref&gt;

Respecting the fervent wish of the late Sultan Muhammad [[Jamalul Kiram III]] to let alone the Islamic Sultanate of Sulu and North Borneo (SSNB) to negotiate peacefully with the Muslim leaders of Malaysia to settle the controversial issue in order not to repeat the March 2013 Lahad Datu, Sabah incident, Chairman Misuari has dismissed the media reports as unfounded and without any ounce of truth involving the MNLF in any level talks. The MNLF, however, asserted that the Sabah case is a non-issue because it is the “home-base for different tribal groupings of Muslims from different regions of Southeast Asia that have enjoyed peaceful and harmonious co-existence with the Chinese and Christian populace in the area.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;br /&gt;

=== Moro migration to Sabah ===
{{see also|Jabidah massacre|Refugees of the Philippines|Illegal immigrants in Malaysia}}
Regional migration flows within [[Southeast Asia]] are not a phenomenon restricted to current times. Social and cultural connections between Sabah, Mindanao and the Indonesian province of [[North Kalimantan]] have existed for centuries. The tradition of border crossing from the Philippine [[Sulu Archipelago]] to Sabah originated in the late 16th century.&lt;ref name="illegals1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.giga-hamburg.de/sites/default/files/openaccess/suedostasienaktuell/2006_5/giga_soa_2006_5_frank.pdf|title=Project Mahathir: ‘Extraordinary’ Population Growth in Sabah (The History of Illegal Immigration to Sabah)|author=Sina Frank|publisher=[[German Institute of Global and Area Studies]]|work=Im Fokus|date=May 2006|accessdate=6 November 2014|pages=72 and 73 / 2 and 3|format=PDF|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141106073701/http://www.giga-hamburg.de/sites/default/files/openaccess/suedostasienaktuell/2006_5/giga_soa_2006_5_frank.pdf |archivedate=6 November 2014|deadurl=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first wave of this migration was linked to the [[Spanish East Indies|Spanish colonialists]] who began pushing southwards toward the island provinces of Sulu and [[Tawi-Tawi]] from Manila, which was the administration centre of the Spanish during that time. The [[Ethnic issues in the Philippines|struggle for dominance between different ethnic groups]] and the Spanish in Mindanao led to increased immigration of Philippine Moro ethnic groups, mostly the [[Tausūg people|Suluks]] and [[Bajau people|Bajaus]] to Sabah.&lt;ref name="illegals1"/&gt;

[[File:Pulau Gaya immigrant dwellings.jpg|thumb|right|A huge [[Moro (ethnic group)|Moro]] settlements in the coast of [[Pulau Gaya|Gaya Island]] near [[Kota Kinabalu]].]]
The first arrival of the illegal immigrants in Sabah in the 1960s was said to be associated with the then Philippine president [[Ferdinand Marcos]] and his country's claim to the northern Borneo region.&lt;ref name="illegals1"/&gt; It is claimed by media in the Philippines that during the first stage of his plan, Marcos sent around 17 men who mostly recruited from Sulu and Tawi-Tawi had entered Sabah as forest rangers, postmen and police. These agents have blended into the Sabah local communities with a plan to possessing the minds of the larger Filipino communities in eastern Sabah to secede from Malaysia and become part of the Philippines as well to destabilising Sabah.&lt;ref name="destabilise"/&gt; At the same time, a Suluk native, [[Mustapha Harun]] became the third [[Chief Minister of Sabah]], he then made a contact with one of the Filipino agent who became his driver.&lt;ref name="destabilise"/&gt; However, most of them did not intend to attack their fellow Muslim brothers in Sabah when they realise their true mission in which they were later execute by Marcos commando soldiers in an event known as [[Jabidah massacre]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://corregidor.org/heritage_battalion/jabidah.html|title=The Corregidor Massacre - 1968|author=Paul F.

Since then, it has caused major economic problems for Sabah as Marcos soldiers launched an operation to eliminate any anti-[[Ferdinand Marcos|Marcos]] factions in the [[Sulu Archipelago|Sulu]] and [[Mindanao]] islands which left much infrastructure there destroyed, forcing an estimated of another 100,000 Moros in Mindanao to flee to Sabah.&lt;ref name="attacks"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1309&amp;dat=19860211&amp;id=HgROAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=cpoDAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=5902,2430732&amp;hl=en|title=Sabah fears new influx of Filipinos|publisher=New Straits Times|date=11 February 1986|accessdate=6 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Most of those who left the Philippines were already involved in criminal activities, mainly [[smuggling]] and armed robbery.&lt;ref name="attacks"/&gt; Today, a huge numbers of Moros still live in many places in Sabah such as [[Kota Kinabalu]], [[Kinarut]], [[Lahad Datu]], [[Sandakan]], Semporna, [[Tawau]], [[Telipok]] as well on [[Labuan]].&lt;ref name="not victimised"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1309&amp;dat=19861028&amp;id=YdRHAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=vY4DAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=4943,2893169&amp;hl=en|title=Refugees not being victimised, says UNHCR|author=Eddy Hiew|publisher=New Straits Times|date=28 October 1986|accessdate=6 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="solving"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1309&amp;dat=19860913&amp;id=9oxUAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=-Y8DAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=5024,2746422&amp;hl=en|title=Solving the Filipino refugee problem|work=Bernama|publisher=New Straits Times|date=13 September 1986|accessdate=6 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="gain citizenship"&gt;{{cite book|author=Kamal Sadiq|title=Paper Citizens: How Illegal Immigrants Acquire Citizenship in Developing Countries|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=xDa6LrF1yCIC&amp;pg=PA47|date=2 December 2008|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0-19-970780-5|pages=47–}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Examiner|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=UEU_AAAAMAAJ|year=1979|publisher=L.O.

=== Attack strategy ===
The tactics are different, and are based on the motives of individual groups. Generally, the Moro pirate and militants will attack and escape to the [[Malaysia–Philippines border]] or any nearby islands when their activities are spotted by the security forces. Both the pirates and militants will usually steal boat engines, food and other useful things that can be sold.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.theborneopost.com/2014/07/08/armed-group-fails-to-kidnap-cage-fish-farmer-in-semporna/|title=Armed group fails to kidnap cage-fish farmer in Semporna|publisher=The Borneo Post|date=8 July 2014|accessdate=5 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In certain cases, they also attack towns, killing innocent civilians and kidnapping them as shown in the Lahad Datu and Semporna attacks.&lt;ref name="pirates"/&gt; The Filipino illegal immigrants play an important role in helping them by providing information on their next target.&lt;ref name="provide"/&gt; Due to the increase security patrol by the [[Malaysian Armed Forces]], the militants group such as the [[Abu Sayyaf]] has change their tactics by attacking and abducting foreign vessel crews. Many of those who fleeing from the Philippine military operation in the southern Philippines also sneaking into Sabah with new tactics by entering the state in a small group to avoid from being detected as suspicious by the Malaysian security forces, this was discovered following the tip-off from local villagers who saw many new suspicious people coming into their village from the sea shortly after the continuous military operation. Many of them are believed to be member of militants and kidnapping groups.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dailyexpress.com.my/news.cfm?NewsID=113062 |title=New tactic – sneaking into Sabah in smaller groups |publisher=Daily Express |date=27 September 2016 |accessdate=27 September 2016 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160928060122/http://www.dailyexpress.com.my/news.cfm?NewsID=113062 |archivedate=28 September 2016 |deadurl=yes |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Australian soldiers ferried in small craft to guard Sabah (AWM NAVY05185).JPG|thumb|left|Australian soldiers being ferried in a small craft, from troop transport [[HMAS Sydney (R17)|HMAS ''Sydney'']] on its arrival in North Borneo (Sabah) to counter [[Indonesia–Malaysia confrontation|Indonesian confrontation]] and possible attacks by [[Moro Pirates|Filipino pirates]] as part of their defence aid program to Malaysia in 1964.]]
In 1962, seven Filipino Moros armed with [[machete]]s attacked the town of [[Kunak]] and robbed the businessmen there. The seven Filipino Moros attacked again in 1963, this time attacking the town of Semporna and killing a number of residents.&lt;ref name="major"/&gt; In October 1979, a passenger boat on the way to Semporna from Lahad Datu with 48 passengers was attacked and forced to dock at [[Adal Island]]. Three passengers were shot dead, one woman was [[rape]]d and the others was taken to the Philippines but were quickly rescued by the Philippine security forces. In 1980, a group of 6–8 Moros attacked an island near Semporna with [[M16 rifle]]s, killing villagers while they were asleep. At the end, seven villagers were killed while 11 others were injured. In 1982, a groups of Moros ambushed a village in [[Timba-Timba Island]], and started to shoot, rob and kill villagers. The incident in 1985, which is considered to be the most terrifying attack out of all of them, was where 21 people were killed and another 11 wounded. Five of the intruders were killed by the Malaysian maritime police while the others managed to escaped. At the end of the tragedy, one of the victim said;

&lt;blockquote&gt;I cannot help wondering about [[Government of Malaysia|our government]], which can’t seem to defend us against these marauders.&lt;ref name="attacks"/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In 1987, two Japanese managers was killed while others were wounded after twelve gunmen attack a factory in the [[Boheydulang Island]], forcing the company to close and move their factory to Indonesia.&lt;ref name="pirates"/&gt; In 1996, two separate armed groups from Mindanao attack the town of Semporna, the first group attack a police station by throwing a [[fish bomb]] while the second group managed to steal jewellery worth around [[Malaysian ringgit|MYR]]100,000 at a gold shop. During the shoot-out, two of the group members were captured by the police with 200 bullets recovered from them. However, the rest managed to escape. In March 1996, another attacks by 10–20 Moros happens in the town of Semporna when three separate armed groups attacked different places at the same time. The first group attacked a police headquarters while the second group attacked a police station. It is acknowledged the motive of the first and second group was to delay time and let the third group succeed in robbing a gold shop. No arrest was made and all the intruders managed to escaped with MYR 200,000. Again in July 1996, four armed men attack a gold shop in [[Tawau]] and managed to steal jewellery worth around MYR 150,000. However, one of the gunmen later made a mistake when he retreated to a refugee village in Tawau where he was shot dead by the police. After an hour of investigation, another 5 gunmen from other groups were killed by the police.&lt;ref name="pirates"/&gt;

While he support the suggestion, the party Secretary-General [[Johnny Mositun]] reminded:&lt;ref name="prob"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dailyexpress.com.my/news.cfm?NewsID=95100 |title=Manila to blame, says PBS |publisher=Daily Express |date=15 December 2014 |accessdate=15 December 2014 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141215114203/http://www.dailyexpress.com.my/news.cfm?NewsID=95100 |archivedate=15 December 2014 |deadurl=yes |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Nearly half of the patients using Sabah hospitals are mostly Filipinos. For the better part of four decades, the Filipinos in Sabah – refugees, migrant workers and illegal immigrants – have all been denied any substantial services or assistance from the Philippine government. They survive only because the [[Government of Malaysia|Malaysian Government]] adheres strictly to international norms and standards of law and human rights.

Other Sabahan leaders such as Darell Leiking agreed and reminded the Philippine government to emulate the [[Government of Indonesia|Indonesian government's]] plan by setting up a consulate in Sabah to care for their nationals and set up schools for their children. On a statement, he said:&lt;ref name="emulate"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.therakyatpost.com/news/2014/12/16/emulate-indonesian-govt-taking-care-citizens-sabah-philippine-leaders-told/|title=Emulate Indonesian govt in taking care of citizens in Sabah, Philippine leaders told|publisher=The Rakyat Post|date=16 December 2014|accessdate=16 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In his statement:
{{quote|As per announcement by the chief Minister of Sabah, starting 1 February 2017, the ban on doing the economic activities will be lifted.

The behaviour of some individuals, you know – kidnapping and beheading – the inhumanity in this kidnap for ransom affected not only the free trade but economic activities, their livelihood (mainly to us). Without prejudice to the Sabah claim, we will operate (consulate) in Kota Kinabalu, within that complex also we will try to put up the consular office activities to take good care of our people in Sabah and attend to their requirements, including [[Philippine passport|passport]].&lt;ref name="reopen"/&gt;|[[Datu Abul Khayr Alonto|Abdul Khayr Alonto]], Secretary of [[Mindanao Development Authority]] (MinDA).}}

The secretary added that he vowed to work harder to make Mindanao as the gateway of the Philippines as part of the [[BIMP-EAGA]] and asked the [[Armed Forces of the Philippines]] (AFP) to strengthened security in the Sulu Sea and Mindanao and eliminating terrorists to encourage more investors to develop the areas.&lt;ref name="reopen"/&gt; However, according to Philippine Representative from [[Palawan]] Jose C. Alvarez, they are more interest to establish a Palawan Business Office in the state than Philippine Office that will also giving the similar services like passport granting, renewal of travel documents and other requirements as well extending business assistance to the Filipino people when the need arises, giving excuses that it is only proper and logical to set up the main office if there are increasing number of Filipino traders especially from Palawan.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dailyexpress.com.my/news.cfm?NewsID=117200|title=Palawan plans to set up business office in Sabah|author=Nikko Fabian|publisher=Daily Express|date=16 April 2017|accessdate=16 April 2017|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170416074241/http://www.dailyexpress.com.my/news.cfm?NewsID=117200|archivedate=16 April 2017|deadurl=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Filipinos in the state expressed their hopes that more attention will be given from the Filipino consular services especially on easy and better access in communication facilities, more friendly attitude from embassy officials and staff and transparency in all official transactions as they had repeatedly expressed their dissatisfactions over how the manner of consular missions were conducted with the presence of "middlemen", delays in deliveries of travel documents, difficulties to telephone the main Philippine embassy in Kuala Lumpur and rudeness of some of the embassy officials and staff.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dailyexpress.com.my/news.cfm?NewsID=117276|title=Sabah Filipinos hope for better consular services|author=Nikko Fabian|publisher=Daily Express|date=20 April 2017|accessdate=21 April 2017|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170420075216/http://www.dailyexpress.com.my/news.cfm?NewsID=117276|archivedate=20 April 2017|deadurl=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite the return of barter trade activity, the state of Sabah has maintained they will always be cautious on their trade with the Philippines.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://m.themalaymailonline.com/malaysia/article/sabah-trades-cautiously-with-the-philippines-due-to-security-situation|title=Sabah trades cautiously with the Philippines due to security situation|work=Bernama|publisher=The Malay Mail|date=4 June 2017|accessdate=6 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''David Hampton''' (April 28, 1964 &amp;ndash; July 18, 2003) was an [[Americans|American]] [[confidence trick|con artist]] and robber who became infamous in the 1980s after he managed to convince a group of wealthy [[Manhattan]]ites to give him money, food, and shelter, convincing them he was the son of [[Sidney Poitier]]. His story became the inspiration for a [[Six Degrees of Separation (play)|play]] and a [[Six Degrees of Separation (film)|film]]. He died of AIDS-related complications in 2003.

==Background==
Hampton was born in [[Buffalo, New York]] and was the eldest son of an attorney. He moved to [[New York City]] in 1981 and stumbled upon his now-famous ruse in 1983 when he and another man were attempting to gain entry into [[Studio 54]]. Unable to obtain entry, Hampton's partner decided to pose as [[Gregory Peck]]'s son while Hampton assumed the identity of [[Sidney Poitier]]'s son. They were ushered in as celebrities. Hampton began employing the persona of "David Poitier" to cadge free meals in restaurants. He also persuaded at least a dozen people into letting him stay with them and give him money, including [[Melanie Griffith]], [[Gary Sinise]], [[Calvin Klein (fashion designer)|Calvin Klein]], [[John Jay Iselin]], the president of [[WNET]]; [[Osborn Elliott]], the dean of the [[Columbia University Graduate School of Journalism]]; [[Leonard Bernstein]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first=Morgan|last=Falconer |url=https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/john-guare-on-his-1990-play-six-degrees-of-separation-86knrhlftf5|title=John Guare on his 1990 play Six Degrees of Separation|date=January 9, 2010|publisher=TheTimes.co.uk|accessdate=July 19, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; and a Manhattan [[urologist]]. He convinced some that he was an acquaintance of their children, some that he had just missed a plane to [[Los Angeles, California|Los Angeles]] with his luggage still on it, and some that his belongings had been stolen.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/obituaries/1436727/David-Hampton.html|title=Obituary: David Hampton|date=2003-07-22|publisher=telegraph.co.uk|accessdate=3 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1990/06/21/theater/the-life-of-fakery-and-delusion-in-john-guare-s-six-degrees.html?pagewanted=all&amp;src=pm|title=The Life of Fakery and Delusion In John Guare's 'Six Degrees'|last=Witchel|first=Alex|date=1990-06-21|publisher=nytimes.com|accessdate=3 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In October 1983, Hampton was arrested and convicted for his frauds and was ordered to pay restitution of $4,490 to his various victims.{{citation needed|date=January 2013}} After refusing to comply with these terms, he was sentenced to a term of 18 months to 4 years in prison.

==''Six Degrees of Separation''==
[[Playwright]] [[John Guare]] became interested in Hampton's story through his friendship with [[Inger McCabe Elliott]] and [[Osborn Elliott]], who had been outraged to find "David Poitier" in bed with another man the morning after they let him into their home. ''[[Six Degrees of Separation (play)|Six Degrees of Separation]]'' opened at the [[Lincoln Center]] in May 1990 and became a long-running success.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Six Degrees of Impersonation|author=Kasindorf, Jeanie  | magazine=New York Magazine |date=1991-03-25 |page=40 |accessdate=2011-08-03|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=9ugCAAAAMBAJ&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;pg=PA40#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false}}
&lt;/ref&gt;

Hampton attempted to parlay the play's success to his benefit, giving interviews to the press, [[gate-crashing]] a producer's party, and beginning a campaign of harassment against Guare that included phone calls and death threats, prompting Guare to apply for a restraining order in April 1991, which was unsuccessful. In the fall of 1991, Hampton filed a $100 million lawsuit, claiming that the play had infringed on the copyright on his persona and his story. The lawsuit was eventually dismissed.

==Later life==
After his release, Hampton continued to adopt false identities. After the play and film made his original con well-known, Hampton evolved other false identities and traveled extensively to find new victims.  Hampton was in and out of prison in numerous states. He was interviewed during each break from incarceration by a journalist with the TV show ''The Justice Files'', seen in the USA on [[Discovery Channel]].{{Citation needed|date=October 2017}}

After declaring his rehabilitation, Hampton continued traveling at least as late as 1996, where he found a large number of men who, even if they'd heard of his notoriety from the [[East Coast (USA)|East Coast]], had never seen his picture or the press, allowing him to move about unnoticed and simultaneously con multiple victims. In Spring 1996, Hampton arrived in [[Seattle]], [[State of Washington|Washington]], USA, posing as Antonio de Montilio, the son of a wealthy [[District of Columbia]] physician.  Due to his light skin color, victims claimed he could easily be believed as the [[Puerto Rican people|Puerto Rican]] he claimed to be.  Typically, his story was colorful. Hampton claimed to have been mugged upon arriving in Seattle early for a work assignment for ''[[Vogue (magazine)|Vogue]]'' magazine.  He was to interview [[Bill Gates]] but was suddenly in peril as his wallet was stolen and nothing could be replaced until that weekend was over.  Hampton managed to woo two people within blocks of each other without their being aware that he was working them both.  It is believed that he was first drawn to one victim, Justin Baird, because Baird had been identified at RPlace as the official taking in fundraising dollars from Bunny Brigade volunteers as they returned from their collection rounds.

David Hampton died of [[AIDS]]-related complications while being treated for his illness at [[Beth Israel Medical Center|Beth Israel Hospital]] in [[Manhattan]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.playbill.com/news/article/80762-David-Hampton-Con-Man-Whose-Exploits-Inspired-Six-Degrees-Dead-at-39|title=David Hampton, Con-Man Whose Exploits Inspired Six Degrees, Dead at 38|last=Jones|first=Kenneth|date=2003-07-20|publisher=playbill.com|quote=David Hampton, the inspiration for the young black con-man who fools white New York society in John Guare's popular play, Six Degrees of Separation, died at New York's Beth Israel Hospital, a friend told newspapers and wire services.

The [[Latin]] phrases '''''De mortuis nihil nisi bonum''''' and '''''De mortuis nil nisi bene [dicendum]''''' ("Of the dead, [say] nothing but good") indicate that it is socially inappropriate to speak ill of the dead. As a mortuary [[aphorism]], ''De mortuis. . . .'' derives from the Latin sentence ''[[wikt:de#Latin|De]] [[wikt:mortuus#Latin|mortuis]] [[wikt:nil#Latin|nil]] [[wikt:nisi#Latin|nisi]] [[wikt:bonus#Latin|bonum]] [[wikt:dico#Latin|dicendum]] [[wikt:sum#Latin|est]]'' ("Of the dead nothing but good is to be said"), which also is abbreviated as '''''Nil nisi bonum'''''. Freer translations into English are often used as aphorisms, these include: "Speak no ill of the dead", "Of the dead, speak no evil", and "Do not speak ill of the dead".

The first recorded use of the phrase of mortuary respect dates from the 4th century, published in the ''[[Lives and Opinions of Eminent Philosophers]]'' (ca. AD 300), Book 1, Chapter 70, by [[Diogenes Laërtius]], wherein the Greek aphorism ''τὸν τεθνηκóτα μὴ κακολογεῖν'' (''tòn tethnekóta mè kakologeîn'', "Do not speak ill of the dead") is attributed to [[Chilon of Sparta]] (ca. 600 BC), one of the [[Seven Sages of Greece]]. In the 15th century, during the [[Italian Renaissance]], the [[Humanism|humanist]] monk [[Ambrogio Traversari]] translated Diogenes’s Greek book into Latin, as ''Laertii Diogenis vitae et sententiae eorum qui in philosophia probati fuerunt'' (1433), and so popularized ''De mortuis nihil nisi bonum'', the Latin aphorism advising respect for the dead.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Traversari|first=Ambrogio|title=Laertii Diogenis vitae et sententiae eorvm qvi in philosophia probati fvervnt|year=1432|publisher=Impressum Venetiis per Nicolaum Ienson gallicum|location=Venice|url=http://library.lib.asu.edu/record=b1922627~S3|authorlink=Ambrogio Traversari|editor=Benedictus Brognolus|accessdate=12 May 2013|language=Latin}}&lt;/ref&gt;

*  ''[[The Last Chronicle of Barset]]'' (1867), by [[Anthony Trollope]] &lt;blockquote&gt; After the sudden death of the Bishop's wife, the Archdeacon describes ''De mortuis'' as a proverb "founded in humbug" that only need be followed in public and is unable to bring himself to adopt "the namby-pamby every-day decency of speaking well of one of whom he had ever thought ill."&lt;/blockquote&gt;
*  ''[[The Power-House]]'' (1916), by [[John Buchan]] &lt;blockquote&gt; After destroying the villain, Andrew Lumley, the hero, Sir Edward Leithen, speaks ''De mortuis &amp; c.'', an abbreviated version of the phrase, about the dead Lumley.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
* ''[[The Haunted Bookshop]]'' (1919), by [[Christopher Morley]] &lt;blockquote&gt; Roger considers ''De Mortuis Nil Nisi Bonum'' as a possible inscription on the gravestone for Bock, his dog that died in an explosion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Morley |first=Christopher |author-link=Christopher Morley |date=1919 |title=The Haunted Bookshop |url=https://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/172 |location=New York |publisher=Grosset &amp; Dunlap}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
* ''[[Lonely Road (novel)|Lonely Road]]'' (1932), by [[Neville Shute]]

&lt;blockquote&gt; After the thwarting of his gun-running operation, meant to alter the course of British politics, the villain, Professor Ormsby, challenges the hero, Commander Stevenson, with the phrase ''De mortuis nil nisi bonum'', to imply that he, Prof. Ormsby, would kill himself, for which reason Commander Stevenson would cancel the news-media campaign with which he had planned to publicly discredit Ormsby as a traitor.

To the implicit, honour-saving offer, Stevenson replies, “Certainly, I am concerned with justice in this matter, not with politics.”

The next day, Professor Ormsby defenestrates himself from his rooms at [[Cambridge University]], and Commander Stevenson returns to his life on the [[River Dart]].&lt;/blockquote&gt;
* ''[[Murder Must Advertise]]'' (1933), by [[Dorothy L. Sayers]] &lt;blockquote&gt; About the dead man, two characters speak; the first asks: “What sort of chap was Dean?” . . .

The second replies: “Well. ''De mortuis'', and all that, but I wasn’t exactly keen on him. I thought him rather an unwholesome little beast.”&lt;/blockquote&gt;
* ''[[Busman's Honeymoon|Busman’s Honeymoon]]'' (1937), by [[Dorothy L. Sayers]]

&lt;blockquote&gt; About the dead man, two characters speak; the first, Mr Puffett, says: “They’re takin’ Mr. Noakes away” . . . “It’s a good thing Mr. Noakes ain’t alive to see all that ’eap of coal. That’s a fire as does credit to any chimney.”

Hearing steps on the path, and seeing a dismal little procession passing the window: a sergeant of police and another uniformed man, carrying a stretcher between them . . . Mr. Puffett glanced from the window and removed his bowler hat: “And where’s all ’is cheeseparin’ brought ’im now?” he demanded.

The second man, [[Lord Peter Wimsey]], says: “Nowhere . . . ''De mortuis''” and then some . . . Yes, he seems to be getting a nice derangement of epitaphs, poor old creature.”&lt;/blockquote&gt;
* ''[[Player Piano (novel)|Player Piano]]'' (1952), by [[Kurt Vonnegut]]. &lt;blockquote&gt; An engineer, Dr. Paul Proteus, recalls the phrase ''de mortuis'' in relation to fellow workers who committed a social ''faux pas'' during the annual social gathering; they would not be invited for the next year’s gathering.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
*  ''[[Deus Irae]]'' (1976), by [[Philip K. Dick]] and [[Roger Zelazny]] &lt;blockquote&gt; Father Handy thinks of the phrase in reference to millions of people killed by nerve gas. He then subverts the phrase to "de mortuis nil nisi malum" in blaming them for complacently voting in the politicians responsible.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
*  [[Rites of Passage (novel)|''Rites of Passage'']] (1980), by [[William Golding]] &lt;blockquote&gt; The phrase is used during a conversation between the narrator and Miss Granham in the final section of the novel. After she calls the late Colley a "truly degraded man", Talbot springs to his defence: "Come, ma'am...''de mortuis'' and all that! A single unlucky indulgence {{em dash}} The man was harmless enough."&lt;/blockquote&gt;

====Short story====
* “De Mortuis” (1942), by [[John Collier (fiction writer)|John Collier]]. &lt;blockquote&gt; After an unwitting cuckold is accidentally informed of his wife’s infidelities, he plans an opportunistic revenge; the titular phrase, ''de mortuis'', implies the murderous ending of the story.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
* “Silence, Please”, by [[Arthur C. Clarke]] &lt;blockquote&gt; The mortuary phrase sums up and describes the feelings of other characters about the dead man, who was a university student–inventor who evoked mixed feelings towards himself. The short story “Silence, Please” is included to the collection ''[[Tales from the White Hart]]'' (1957).&lt;/blockquote&gt;
* "[[EPICAC (short story)|EPICAC]]", by [[Kurt Vonnegut]] &lt;blockquote&gt; After the demise of his friend/project - EPICAC, the supercomputer, the protagonist states the phrase in a memoir of someone who has done great for him.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

====Poetic====
[[Image:Adam Lindsay Gordon - Melbourne monument.jpg|right|thumb|175px|The bush poet and balladeer Adam Lindsay Gordon, Melbourne.]]
* In “Sunlight on the Sea” (The Philosophy of a Feast), by [[Adam Lindsay Gordon]], the mortuary phrase is the penultimate line of the eighth, and final, stanza of the poem.

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;poem&gt;
We eat and drink, we come and go,
(The sunlight dies upon the open sea.)
I speak in riddles. Is it so?
My riddles need not mar your glee;
For I will neither bid you share
My thoughts, nor will I bid you shun,
Though I should see in yonder chair
Th’ Egyptian’s muffled skeleton.
One toast with me, your glasses fill,
Aye, fill them level with the brim,
''De mortuis, nisi bonum, nil!''
The lights are growing dim.
&lt;/poem&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The poem, “Sunlight on the Sea” (The Philosophy of a Feast), is in the collection, ''Sea Spray and Smoke Drift'' (1876).

* In “The Open Grave”, by [[Louise Glück|Louise Elisabeth Glück]], the mortuary phrase is repeated as a framing cadence.

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;poem&gt;
My mother made my need,
my father my conscience.
''De mortuis nil nisi bonum''.

Therefore it will cost me
bitterly to lie,
to prostrate myself
at the edge of a grave.

I say to the earth
“be kind to my mother,
now and later.
Save, with your coldness,
the beauty we all envied."

I became an old woman.
I welcomed the dark
I used so to fear.
''De mortuis nil nisi bonum''.
&lt;/poem&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The poem, “The Open Grave”, is in the collection, ''Vita Nova'' (1999).

[[File:Sigmund Freud, by Max Halberstadt (cropped).jpg|thumb|right|175px|In ''Thoughts for the Times on War and Death'' (1915), Sigmund Freud denounced the cultural stupidity that was the First World War (1914–18); yet, in the essay “Our Attitude Towards Death”, recognised the humanity of the participants, and the respect owed them in the mortuary phrase ''De mortuis nil nisi bene''.]]

===Philosophic===
* The psychoanalyst [[Sigmund Freud]] mentions the phrase in ''[[Thoughts for the Times on War and Death]]'' (1915), in the second part of the essay, “Our Attitude Towards Death”, wherein he said:

{{Quotation|We assume a special attitude towards the dead, something almost like admiration for one who has accomplished a very difficult feat. We suspend criticism of him, overlooking whatever wrongs he may have done, and issue the command, ''De mortuis nil nisi bene'': we act as if we were justified in singing his praises at the funeral oration, and inscribe only what is to his advantage on the tombstone. This consideration for the dead, which he really no longer needs, is more important to us than the truth, and, to most of us, certainly, it is more important than consideration for the living.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Freud|first=Sigmund|title=Our Attitude Towards Death|url=http://www.bartleby.com/282/2.html|website=Thoughts for the Times on War and Death|publisher=Bartleby.com|accessdate=24 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

===Cinematic===
* In the war–adventure film ''[[Lawrence of Arabia (film)|Lawrence of Arabia]]'' (1962) &lt;blockquote&gt; The phrase is cautiously used at the funeral of [[T. E. Lawrence]], officiated at [[St Paul's Cathedral]]; two men, a clergyman and a soldier,  Colonel Brighton, are observing a bust of the dead “Lawrence of Arabia”, and commune in silent mourning.

The clergyman asks: “Well, ''nil nisi bonum''. But did he really deserve . . . a place in here?”

Colonel Brighton’s reply is a pregnant silence.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

[[File:Chekhov 1898 by Osip Braz.jpg|thumb|right|175px|The playwright Anton Chekhov.]]

===Theatrical===
* In ''[[The Seagull]]'' (1896), by [[Anton Chekhov]], a character mangles the mortuary phrase.   &lt;blockquote&gt; In Act 1, in an effort at light [[metaphor]],  the bourgeois character Ilya Afanasyevich Shamrayev, misquotes the Latin phrase ''Nil nisi bonum'' and conflates it with the [[maxim (philosophy)|maxim]] ''[[De gustibus non est disputandum]]'' (“About taste there is no disputing”), which results in the mixed mortuary opinion: ''De gustibus aut bene, aut nihil'' (“Let nothing be said of taste, but what is good”).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | last = Chekhov | first = Anton | authorlink = Anton Chekhov |author2=Stephen Mulrine, Translator | title = The Seagull | publisher = Nick Hern Books Ltd | year = 1997 | location = London | pages = Introduction, p. xvii | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=0VmB4tPlnIAC&amp;pg=PR17 | isbn = 978-1-85459-193-7 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
*In ''[[Julius Caesar (play)|Julius Caesar]]'' (1599) by [[William Shakespeare]], Mark Antony uses what is possibly a perverted form of the phrase ''De mortuis nil nisi bonum'', when he says: &lt;blockquote&gt;The evil that men do lives after them; The good is oft interred with their bones...&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | last = Shakespeare | first = William | authorlink = William Shakespeare | title = Julius Caesar | url = http://shakespeare.mit.edu/julius_caesar/full.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1913">The '''Fontainebleau Memorandum''' is the name given to a document written by [[United Kingdom|British]] [[Prime Minister of the United Kingdom|Prime Minister]] [[David Lloyd George]] and his advisers during the [[Paris Peace Conference, 1919]] that was drafting the [[Treaty of Versailles]]. It was titled ‘Some Considerations for the Peace Conference Before They Finally Draft Their Terms, March 25th, 1919’.&lt;ref name="Jones"&gt;{{cite book|last=Jones|first=Thomas|authorlink=Thomas Jones (civil servant)|title=Lloyd George|year=1951|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=London|page=171|chapter=Prime Minsiter in Peace 1918-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Lloyd George and the [[President of the United States]], [[Woodrow Wilson]], were opposed to the French demand for Allied occupation of the [[Rhineland]] except as a temporary measure to be used as a guarantee for German payment of [[World War I reparations|reparations]].&lt;ref&gt;David Lloyd George, ''The Truth about the Peace Treaties. Volume I'' (London: Victor Gollancz, 1938), p. 403.&lt;/ref&gt; Lloyd George therefore decided to set down in writing the limits to which the British delegation at the Conference were prepared to go. Lloyd George, [[Jan Smuts|General Smuts]], Sir [[Sir Henry Wilson, 1st Baronet|Henry Wilson]], Sir [[Maurice Hankey]] and [[Philip Kerr, 11th Marquess of Lothian|Philip Kerr]] retired to [[Fontainebleau]] to decide what kind of peace treaty they would like to see.&lt;ref&gt;Lloyd George, pp. 403-404.&lt;/ref&gt;

The memorandum called for a peace based on justice that would not provoke future wars. It also warned of the danger of provoking Germany into becoming [[Bolsheviks|Bolshevik]] and it endorsed the creation of a [[League of Nations]] to ensure international right and the abolition of [[arms race|competitive armaments]].&lt;ref name="Jones"/&gt;

'''Gatifloxacin''' sold under the brand names '''Gatiflo''', '''Tequin''' and '''Zymar''', is an [[antibiotic]] of the fourth-generation [[fluoroquinolone]] family,&lt;ref name="pmid15953577"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Burka JM, Bower KS, Vanroekel RC, Stutzman RD, Kuzmowych CP, Howard RS |title=The effect of fourth-generation fluoroquinolones gatifloxacin and moxifloxacin on epithelial healing following photorefractive keratectomy |journal=Am.

==Availability==
Gatifloxacin is currently available in the US and Canada only as an ophthalmic solution. 
In China it is sold in tablet as well as in eye drop formulations.Ophthalmic anti-infectives are generally well tolerated. The concentration of the drug observed following oral administration of 400&amp;nbsp;mg gatifloxacin systemically is approximately 800 times higher than that of the 0.5% Gatifloxacin eye drop. Given as an eye drop, Gatifloxacin Ophthalmic Solution 0.3% &amp; 0.5% cause very low systemic exposures. Therefore, the systemic exposures resulting from the gatifloxacin ophthalmic solution are not likely to pose any risk for systemic toxicities.{{citation needed|date=March 2017}}

The '''Guiding 2010 Centenary''' consisted of celebrations around the world in which [[Girl Guides|Girl Guides and Girl Scouts]] celebrated 100 years of the world Guide and Scout movement. It took place over three years, 2010-2012, reflecting the founding dates of many [[World Association of Girl Guides and Girl Scouts]] member organisations.

National Guide and Scout movements added local celebrations to the international ones.

==Centenary Celebration Days==
There were three Centenary Celebration Days. On 10 April each year, celebrations were  held around the world under a unifying theme. The theme for 2010 was ''plant''. The theme for 2011 was ''grow'', and the theme for 2012 was ''share''.

==Girlguiding UK==
[[Girlguiding UK]] started its Centenary celebrations on 4 September 2009.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title = Centenary | url = http://www.girlguiding.org.uk/xq/asp/sID.905/qx/whoweare/article.asp | accessdate =2008-09-22 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20080618164323/http://www.girlguiding.org.uk/xq/asp/sID.905/qx/whoweare/article.asp &lt;!-- Bot retrieved archive --&gt; |archivedate = 2008-06-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Centenary Camp was held from 2010-07-31 to 2010-08-07 at [[Harewood House]]. In September 2009, a [[maze]] to celebrate the [[1909 Crystal Palace Scout Rally|beginnings of Guiding at Crystal Palace]] opened in Crystal Palace Park.

The [[tall ship]] Lord Nelson made a 100-day voyage around the coast of the UK to celebrate the centenary. The Lord Nelson set sail from Glasgow on 7 June 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | title = Girlguides set off on first of 100 Day tall ship adventure | date = 2010-06-07 | url = http://www.jst.org.uk/news/girlguides-set-off-on-first-of-100-day-tall-ship-adventure.aspx | accessdate = 2010-07-02 | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20110720150256/http://www.jst.org.uk/news/girlguides-set-off-on-first-of-100-day-tall-ship-adventure.aspx | archivedate = 20 July 2011 | df = dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; She called at Oban, Aberdeen, Newcastle, Boston, London, Chatham, Portsmouth, Falmouth, Milford Haven and Whitehaven.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news | last = Barwise | first = Jenny | title = Youngsters help Guide Tall Ship into Cumbrian Harbour | newspaper = News and Star | date = 2010-09-07 | url = http://www.newsandstar.co.uk/news/youngsters-help-guide-tall-ship-into-cumbrian-harbour-1.755088?referrerPath=news | accessdate = 2010-09-22 | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20120322011748/http://www.newsandstar.co.uk/news/youngsters-help-guide-tall-ship-into-cumbrian-harbour-1.755088?referrerPath=news | archivedate = 22 March 2012 | df = dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; At each port she took on new crew, many of whom had never sailed before.

==Girl Guides Australia==
[[Girl Guides Australia]] celebrated 100 years of Guiding across Australia from September 2009 to February 2011.

The Australian Centenary Event (ACE) was held 3–9 January 2010 just outside [[Melbourne]], [[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria]]. It was an international camp for 2500 girls, with another 500-700 leaders attending. Pippa Penguin was the [[mascot]] for ACE. ACE was to be held at [[Britannia Park (Girl Guides Victoria)|Britannia Park]], but was moved after high risk of bushfire.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.guidesvic.org.au/home/content.asp?pageID=382&amp;l1=209&amp;l2=322&amp;l3=382&lt;/ref&gt;

Other nationwide Centenary events included simultaneous 100 Downunder activities on May 23 and Promise renewals on 10-10-10 at 10am.

The Australian Government named 2010 the 'Year of the Girl Guide' in honour of the centenary celebrations.  They also issued a commemorative $1 coin into circulation as well as 3 postage stamps to celebrate the event.

The Chain of Campfires event was held on June 19. Units across Australia lit campfires between 5pm and 9pm.

==Girl Guides of Canada==
Guiding Mosaic 2010 was held from July 8–17 at [[Guelph Lake]] Conservation Area in Southern Ontario.

[[File:Hey Rube!! or, A day at the circus (NYPL Hades-447682-1153778).jpg|thumb|200px|right|1891 sheet music for "Hey Rube!! or, A Day at the Circus"]]
'''"Hey, Rube!"''' is a slang phrase most commonly used in the [[United States]] by [[circus]] and [[traveling carnival]] workers ("[[carny|carnies]]"), with origins in the middle 19th century. It is a rallying call, or a cry for help, used by carnies in   a fight with outsiders. It is also sometimes used to refer to such a fight: "The clown got a black eye in a Hey, Rube."&lt;ref name=carlyon/&gt;

In the early days of circuses in America (c. 1800–1860), it was very common for carnies to get into fights with the locals as they travelled from town to town.&lt;ref name=carlyon/&gt; Circuses were rowdy, loud, and often lewd affairs, where country people could gather, blow off steam, and voice political views. [[Mark Twain]]'s classic description of a circus and other shows in ''[[Adventures of Huckleberry Finn]]'' provides illustration. It was a rare show that did not include at least some violence, and this often involved the members of the circus.

When a carnie was attacked or in trouble, he would yell "Hey, Rube!" and all carnies in earshot would rush to his aid. Circus pioneer and legendary clown [[Dan Rice]] called it "a terrible cry, [meaning] as no other expression in the language does, that a fierce deadly fight is on, that men who are far away from home [travelling circus workers] must band together in a struggle that means life or death to them."&lt;ref name=carlyon/&gt; "Hey, Rube!" is still the safety phrase used by many modern theatrical performers to alert security of a violent audience member, especially in outdoor or festival environments where entertainers are in close proximity with large numbers of intoxicated patrons.

The origin of the expression can be traced to 1848 when a member of [[Dan Rice]]'s troupe was attacked at a [[New Orleans]] dance house. That man yelled to his friend, named "Reuben", who rushed to his aid.&lt;ref name=carlyon&gt;{{cite book |author=Emerson, Ken |author2=Carlyon, David |title=Dan Rice: the most famous man you've never heard of |publisher=Public Affairs |location=New York |year=2001 |isbn=1-891620-57-6 }} Chapter 20 "Hey, Rube!"&lt;/ref&gt; Another explanation is that the name "Rube" is a slang term for country folk (e.g., "Rustic Reubens"), usually shortened to "[[wikt:rubes|Rubes]]".{{Citation needed|date=April 2014}}

The ''Oxford English Dictionary's'' first entry for "Hey, Rube!" is from 1882, in the [[Chicago]] ''Times'' (3 Dec. Suppl. 12/4): "A canvasman watching a tent is just like a man watching his home. He'll fight in a minute if the outsider cuts the canvas, and if a crowd comes to quarrel he will yell, ‘Hey Rube!’ That's the circus rallying cry, and look out for war when you hear it."

The term is still known and used today in circuses, but usually as an allusion to the "glory days" when circuses were rowdy affairs, rather than in actual fights.&lt;ref name=carlyon/&gt;

{{for|the film|Intermedio (film)}}

The '''intermedio''' {{IPA-it|interˈmɛːdjo|}} (also '''intromessa''', '''introdutto''', '''tramessa''', '''tramezzo''', '''intermezzo'''), in the [[Italian Renaissance]], was a theatrical  performance or spectacle with [[Renaissance music|music]] and often dance which was performed between the acts of a play to celebrate special occasions in Italian [[noble court|courts]].  It was one of the important predecessors to [[opera]], and an influence on other forms like the English court [[masque]].  Weddings in ruling families and similar state occasions were the usual occasion for the most lavish intermedi, in cities such as [[Florence]] and [[Ferrara]].  Some of the best documentation of intermedi comes from weddings in the [[Medici]] family, in particular the 1589 Medici wedding (between [[Christina, Grand Duchess of Tuscany|Christina of Lorraine]] and [[Ferdinando I de' Medici, Grand Duke of Tuscany]]), which featured what was undoubtedly both the most spectacular set of intermedi, and the best known, thanks to no fewer than 18 contemporary published festival books and sets of [[old master print|prints]] that were financed by the Grand Duke.&lt;ref&gt;Reed &amp; Wallace:205-7&lt;/ref&gt;

Intermedi were written and performed from the late 15th century through the 17th century, although the peak of development of the genre was in the late 16th century.  After 1600 the form merged with opera, for the most part, though intermedi continued to be used in non-musical plays in certain settings (for example in academies), and also continued to be performed between the acts of operas.

==Development==
The first intermedii were  not in Florence but in [[Ferrara]] at the end of the 15th century between the five acts of plays by the classical authors [[Plautus]] and [[Terence]]. Writing of the "intermezzi" at the wedding of [[Lucrezia Borgia]] in 1502, [[Isabella d'Este]] said that they were more interesting than the boring ''commedia'', "a remark destined to be often repeated".&lt;ref&gt;Shearman, 105&lt;/ref&gt;  Ferrara intermezzi at this period were short and without a unifying theme; they included choruses, recitations and ''[[moresca]]'' dances.  But by 1513 there was a unifying [[allegory]], explained at the end.  It was for Florentine public celebrations that Intermedii came into their own; several were organised by [[Machiavelli]] when he was part of the government of the [[Republic of Florence]] in the early 16th century, and the returning Medici adopted a policy of keeping the aristocracy occupied by involving them in productions.&lt;ref&gt;Shearman, 105&lt;/ref&gt;

As the intermedio developed in the 16th century, it grew more and more elaborate, often becoming a "play within a play"; for example during a five-act play, an intermedio would consist of four parts, which might be presented as a four-part metaphor of time passing in the play.  This stage begins with ''Il commodo'', from the Medici wedding in [[Florence]] of [[Cosimo I de' Medici, Grand Duke of Tuscany|Cosimo I]] and [[Eleanor of Toledo]] in 1539,&lt;ref&gt;[http://special-1.bl.uk/treasures/festivalbooks/BookDetails.aspx?strFest=0189 Festival Book online]&lt;/ref&gt; where the four parts were morning, noon, afternoon, and night, represented with an elaborate mechanical artificial sun, with singing and dancing appropriate to each time.  Some critics of the time noted that the intermedi had become so elaborate that the play had begun to serve as intermedi to the intermedi.

==Mature intermedio==
Originally intermedi had used the sets already on the stage from the main play, typically fairly simple ones for a comedy, with a few extra pieces, but later they had their own sets, which a mythological subject required to be more elaborate.  [[Vasari]]'s production for yet another Medici wedding in 1565 "embodied stupendous advances in engineering technique" with all the elaborate movements of scenery done without a curtain in full view of the audience.&lt;ref&gt;Strong:134-6&lt;/ref&gt;  According to [[Roy Strong]]: "the designs for the 1589 intermezzi are crucial, for they are the earliest mass-disseminated illustrations of what became a norm throughout Europe for theatrical visual experience for the next three hundred years, the [[proscenium arch]] behind which receded ranks of side wings, the vista closed by a back-shutter."&lt;ref&gt;Strong:140&lt;/ref&gt; Eventually the form acquired a tradition and cohesiveness that allowed it to stand on its own, and it was thus a logical development to combine the existing features with sung, acted parts, and be absorbed into the new artform of opera, which also drew from the traditions of [[monody]] and [[madrigal comedy]]. [[Jacopo Peri]], the composer of [[Dafne]], the first opera, was one of the composers, and almost certainly performers, in the 1589 Medici intermezzi, and the librettist for both, [[Ottavio Rinuccini]], seems to have recycled in ''Dafne'' some of the material from the 1589 Delos scene (illustrated at top).

"Festival books", produced as souvenirs of lavish festivities, contain detailed descriptions of many important intermedi, such as those for the Medici wedding of 1589,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ursusbooks.com/item110358.html Album of engravings] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110717175205/http://www.ursusbooks.com/item110358.html |date=2011-07-17 }}, showing several of the sets.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://special-1.bl.uk/treasures/festivalbooks/BookDetails.aspx?strFest=0205 British Library festival book online text]&lt;/ref&gt; for which 286 costumes were made.  Although music written specially for this occasion survives (see discography below), this is usually not the case, and music written for other occasions, for example [[madrigal (music)|madrigal]]s and instrumental pieces, was often used in intermedi.  The subject matter of the intermedio was usually a [[mythology|mythological]] or [[pastoral]] story, which could be told in [[mime artist|mime]], by costumed singers or actors, or by [[dance]], or any combination of these.  There was invariably a political message, even if this was limited to general glorification of the ruling family; at times more specific messages were intended.  Some thematic connection with the main play might be made, though intermedii could be repeated with different plays from the one they were written for.  

Numerous drawings and engravings of the stage sets survive, as well as texts of the libretti and descriptions of the music and action; the 1589 Medici intermezzi were especially well recorded, and "were to be the fount of Italian [[baroque]] scenography as well as influencing the development of the stage north of the Alps, above all the Stuart court [[masque]]s designed by [[Inigo Jones]]".&lt;ref&gt;Strong:136&lt;/ref&gt;  The actual content in terms of staging, music, instrumentation, presence of singers, actors, dancers, or mime was highly variable throughout the period, and sometimes all of these features were present.  The 1589 intermedi were performed in the recently completed theatre in the [[Uffizi Palace]] before an audience of about three thousand, and three further performances were given some days after the end of the wedding festivities. 
Further significant sets of Medici intermedi were produced for the weddings in 1600 of [[Henry IV of France]] and [[Marie de' Medici]], and then in 1608 of [[Cosimo II de' Medici, Grand Duke of Tuscany|Grand Duke Cosimo II]] and a [[Habsburg]] princess, [[Archduchess Maria Maddalena of Austria|Maria Magdalena of Austria]]. However the 1600 celebrations also included a portent of things to come in the form of performances of [[Jacopo Peri]]'s opera ''[[Euridice (opera)|Euridice]]'', the earliest surviving example of the form.

==Music of the Medici intermedi==
[[Image:La pellegrina 1589 - Intermedio 1 - L'armonia delle sfere.jpg|thumb|Another of the 1589 intermedi: number 1: Harmony descends to earth]]
Of the various intermedi that were performed, only the music to some parts of ''Il commodo''  (1539) and, through a 1591 printed edition by [[Cristofano Malvezzi]], an almost complete version of ''[[The Pilgrim Woman|La Pellegrina]]'' (1589) are known to have survived.&lt;ref&gt;liner noters to Sempé, "La Pellegrina", 30&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1539 most of the pieces are in four and five parts so much of this music is suitable for domestic playing. The 1589 music is very different being largely big set pieces for 6, 12, 18 or even 30 parts; 41 instrumentalists were required in all, some hidden around the stage as there was not room for them all in one place.&lt;ref&gt;Grout and Williams, 27&lt;/ref&gt;  Smaller scale pieces are often difficult florid [[monody]] of the [[Giulio Caccini|Caccini]] ''new music'' variety.

Of the surviving intermedi only two numbers were ''[[a cappella]]'', (not counting the [[madrigal (music)|madrigal]]s which were sung at the banquet in 1539 which of course are not intermedi).  This means we have surviving descriptions of precise instrumentation.

Classical humanist dramatic theory says a play should have action taking place during one entire day.  These intermedi do not follow what were believed to be the classical instructions, having an overture item, ''Vattene almo riposo'', and a night time ending for tenor voice accompanied by four [[sackbut]]s and an extra [[coda (music)|coda]] the [[bacchanale]], ''Baccho, Baccho, E U O E''.

==Similar forms outside Italy==

The similar form which developed in France at the same time was called the [[intermède]]; it was more reliant on dance than the Italian version.  The French court under [[Catherine de' Medici]] was also staging [[Catherine de' Medici's court festivals|court festivities of increasing lavishness]] – Catherine's granddaughter was the Medici bride in 1589.  The [[masque]] in England also had many similarities to the intermedio, although it did not originate as a "filler" between acts in a play in the same way.  The later 18th century [[intermezzo]] in opera showed a reversal of the Renaissance scheme; now a single short comic intermezzo was inserted between the acts of a heroic [[opera seria]].

'''JavaZone''' is a software development conference, organized in [[Oslo|Oslo, Norway]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://jz09.java.no/about-javazone/what-is-javazone/ |title=About JavaZone 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110819052548/http://jz09.java.no/about-javazone/what-is-javazone/ |archivedate=2011-08-19 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;


== History ==

The first event in the JavaZone series started out as a [[Sun Microsystems]] event in 2002, with 350 participants in the basement of [[Chateau Neuf]], one of the main hang-outs for Oslo University students. The Norwegian Java User Group, [[javaBin]], was given the responsibility for ensuring the technical quality of the event.

In 2004, javaBin took over the entire event, with [[Sun Microsystems]] contributing as a partner, on a par with the other partners. javaBin moved the conference to the SAS Hotel on Holbergs plass in Oslo. By then, it had grown to 800 participants and 23 partners.

Over the next three years, interest in JavaZone increased steadily, with 800, 1,000 and then 1,400 participants, and it reached an all-time high in 2008, with 2,300 participants and 47 partners. Each year since 2005 the conference has been sold out.

== JavaZone HD ==

JavaZone HD was a new concept introduced at JavaZone 2010 with live streaming of all talks in High Definition video from Oslo to the [[Norwegian University of Science and Technology]] in [[Trondheim]]. JavaZone HD also featured a social networking event on the evening of the first conference day, similar to the larger event in Oslo.

== AweZone ==

AweZone is a festival on the end of the first day with various concerts, stand-up shows and chillout zones for the conference attendees to select from. It allows attendees and speakers to network and socialize after the day's conference programme is over. From 2011 through 2014, AweZone took place at Rockefeller Center in Oslo.

AweZone first took place at the tenth JavaZone. Before that, there was ClubZone, consisting of separate event locations. During its last couple of years, the ClubZone event was organized at the Queens Pub &amp; Pianobar, Dattera til Hagen, Gloria Flames, Ivars and Cafe con Bar near the Oslo Spektrum arena at the center of Oslo.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://jz10.java.no/clubzone.html |title=ClubZone information |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110723090544/http://jz10.java.no/clubzone.html |archivedate=2011-07-23 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== JourneyZone ==

At the weekend following JavaZone 2010 a two-day hike to [[Besseggen]] in Norway was organized for the speakers who wanted to attend.

== Speakers ==

JavaZone has featured a wide range of speakers, both international and domestic.

Squadron Leader '''John Peters''' (born 1961) is a former [[aviator|pilot]] of the [[Royal Air Force]].

==Early life==
He attended the independent [[Churcher's College]] in east [[Hampshire]], leaving in 1980.

By the age of 17, he had his [[Pilot licensing in the United Kingdom|pilot's licence]]. He attended the [[University of Manchester Institute of Science and Technology]] (commonly known as UMIST, now part of the University of Manchester since 2004), gaining a [[Bachelor of Science|BSc]] in Building Technology in 1983. He was an RAF university cadet, joining the RAF in 1980, training at [[RAF Woodvale]] with the [https://web.archive.org/web/20070629005029/http://www.masuas.co.uk/home.php Manchester and Salford] [[University Air Squadron]]. He later graduated with an [[Master of Business Administration|MBA]] from the [[University of Leicester]].

==Career==
After his RAF training, he was based at [[RAF Chivenor]] and [[RAF Lossiemouth]].

He became a staff pilot in 1987 at the Air Navigation School (ANS) of [[No. 6 Flying Training School]] at [[RAF Finningley]]. In 1988, he moved to XV Squadron at [[RAF Laarbruch]] after converting to the Tornado GR1 when a [[Flight Lieutenant]].

===Gulf War===
On his first mission during [[Operation Desert Storm]], when aged 29, an ultra-low level daylight mission on Ar Rumaylah airfield, while acting as number two to [[Squadron Leader]] [[Pablo Mason|Paul "Pablo" Mason]], his [[Panavia Tornado]] [http://www.aeroflight.co.uk/pics/gulfwar/torn/Tornado%20GR%201%20ZD791%20(BG-B)%20lost%20over%20Iraq.jpg ''ZD 791''] of [[No. 15 Squadron RAF|XV Squadron]] was hit at fifty feet by a shoulder-launched [[Surface-to-air missile|SAM]] [[9K34 Strela-3|SA-14]], and he was captured by the [[Iraqi security forces|military of Iraq]].&lt;ref name="AirCadet"&gt;[http://www.aircadetonline.com/flash_site/news_pablo_mason.htm 121 Sqn. ATC - News - Pablo Mason]&lt;/ref&gt; After capture he was shown, bruised and apparently beaten, on television.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.arabtimesonline.com/NewsDetails/tabid/96/smid/414/ArticleID/176888/reftab/69/t/Kuwaiti-pilot-recounts-ordeal-as-POW/Default.aspx&lt;/ref&gt;

He received around 25,000 letters from well-wishers following the appearance. He said that he was "treated very specially" as a result of his experiences and found it difficult to live up to the image the public had of him.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.express.co.uk/life-style/life/564758/Gulf-war-hostage-John-Peters-interview|title=Whatever happened to Gulf war hostage John Peters|author=Tony Padman|website=Sunday Express|date=9 April 2015|access-date=12 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the end of the war, he was released and returned to the RAF for a further ten years.

===Instructor===
Having been at [[RAF Bruggen|RAF Brüggen]], he moved to [[RAF Cottesmore]] (then in [[Leicestershire]]) in 1993, becoming an instructor on the [[Tri-National Tornado Training Establishment|TTTE]]. He graduated with an [[Master of Business Administration|MBA]] from the [[University of Leicester]] Management Centre, with his dissertation being ''The Challenge of Change in the Royal Air Force'' {{Citation needed|date=May 2013}}.

He became a [[Squadron Leader]] in 1997, moving to Turkey, and left the RAF after 18 years.

===Publications===

Her aunt was British actress [[Elizabeth Yates (actress)|Elizabeth Yates]].&lt;ref name="hall"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.southcoasttoday.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20110414/PUB01/104140362/-1/pub01|title=From the Village: Acushnet's Laura Keene was performing at Ford Theater on fateful evening when President Lincoln was shot|last=Hall|first=Robert|date=14 April 2011|publisher=southcoasttoday.com|accessdate=16 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the age of 18, she married [[British Army]] officer Henry Wellington Taylor (some sources identify Taylor as "John").&lt;ref name="hall"/&gt;&lt;ref name=giblin&gt;{{cite book|last=Giblin|first=James|title=Good Brother, Bad Brother: The Story of Edwin Booth and John Wilkes Booth|date=2005|publisher=Houghton Mifflin Harcourt|isbn=0-618-09642-6|page=36}}&lt;/ref&gt; Taylor was reportedly the nephew and godson of [[Arthur Wellesley, 1st Duke of Wellington]].&lt;ref name="hall"/&gt; The couple had two daughters, Emma (born 1846) and Clara Marie Stella (born 1849).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Creahan|first=John|title=The Life of Laura Keene: Actress, Artist, Manager and Scholar. Together with Some Interesting Reminiscences of Her Daughters|date=1897|publisher=Rodgers Publishing Company|pages=177, 254}}&lt;/ref&gt; After being discharged from the army, Taylor opened his own tavern. Around 1850, Taylor was arrested, though the nature of his crime is now unknown. After being convicted, he was reportedly sent from England to [[Australia]] on a [[prison ship]].&lt;ref name=giblin/&gt;&lt;ref name=curry&gt;{{cite book|last=Curry|first=Jane Kathleen|title=Nineteenth-century American Women Theatre Managers|date=1994|publisher=ABC-CLIO|isbn=0-313-29141-1|page=45}}&lt;/ref&gt; Keene would later travel to Australia in order to locate Taylor to divorce him but could never determine his whereabouts. (Some accounts say that Keene did find Taylor but he refused to consent to a divorce).&lt;ref name="hall"/&gt; They remained married until Taylor's death in 1860.&lt;ref name=curry/&gt;&lt;ref name=barrett&gt;{{cite book|title=European Immigrant Women in the United States: A Biographical Dictionary|date=1994|editor1-last=Barrett Litoff|editor1-first=Judy|editor2-last=McDonnell|editor2-first=Judith|publisher=Taylor &amp; Francis|isbn=0-618-09642-6|page=159}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After her husband was sent to prison, Keene was left alone with two children and no money. On the advice of her aunt, actress Elizabeth Yates, she decided to pursue a career as an actress, and would apprentice at her aunt's theatre.&lt;ref name="hall"/&gt;&lt;ref name=giblin/&gt; As it was then socially unacceptable for a woman with children and no husband to act in the theatre, she changed her name to "Laura Keene". Her now widowed mother Jane took over raising her two daughters.&lt;ref name="hall"/&gt;

==Career==
Keene made her professional debut as Pauline in ''The Lady of Lyons'' in London in October 1851. This was followed by performances at London's [[Olympic Theatre|Royal Olympic Theatre]] and [[Lyceum Theatre, London|Royal Lyceum Theatre]], including several months working under [[Lucia Elizabeth Vestris|Madame Vestris]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|editor1=James, Edward T. |editor2=Wilson James, Janet |editor3=Boyer, Paul S. |title=Notable American Women, 1607–1950: A Biographical Dictionary, Volume 1|volume=1|year=1971|publisher=Harvard University Press|isbn=0-674-62734-2|page=312}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1852, less than a year performing in Britain, Keene accepted an offer from [[James William Wallack]] to go to [[New York City]], and serve as the leading lady in the stock company at his successful theater.&lt;ref name=barrett/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://chroniclingamerica.loc.gov/lccn/sn83030313/1852-09-21/ed-1/seq-4/ |title=Miss Laura Keene |date=September 21, 1852 |newspaper=The [[New York Herald]] |edition=morning |p=4, column 4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Her first performance at his theatre was in ''The Will'' as Albino Mandeville. She enjoyed great popularity during her time at [[Wallack's Theatre]] (20 September 1852, through 22 November 1853). In order to have greater control over her career, she then entered into theater management with the help of John Lutz, whom she married in 1860 and was with her for the rest of her career.&lt;ref&gt;Creahan 1897 p. 169&lt;/ref&gt; She left Wallack's company unexpectedly one night and moved to Baltimore.  Keene leased the Charles Street Theater, in [[Baltimore]], from 24 December 1853, to 2 March 1854, where she acted as manager, director and performer. She started doing touring performances in California (6 April through 29 July 1854), in Australia (23 October 1854 through January 1855), and again in California (9 April  through 4 October 1855). During the first stint in California, she was hired by [[Catherine Norton Sinclair]] to play opposite [[Edwin Booth]]. After spending a month as the manager and lessee of the Union Theatre in San Francisco (from 29 June through 29 July 1854), Keene and Booth toured to Australia.  Booth's drunken behavior in Australia put an end to their relationship and their tour.  On her return to California, she also managed the American Theatre. She managed and performed there for a few years until a new law was passed in California banning any form of entertainment on the Sabbath. This greatly decreased the attendance of theatre performances and gave Keene reason to leave and start a new project in New York.

Upon returning to New York City, Keene leased the Metropolitan Theatre, remodeled it, renamed it Laura Keene's Varieties. She served as manager, director and star performer until 23 December when [[William Evans Burton|William Burton]], purchased the building, and moved his own operation there. (It was renamed Burton's New Theatre, and then the [[Winter Garden Theatre (1850)|Winter Garden]].)

[[File:Keene cuff.jpg|thumb|right|The blood-stained sleeve cuff belonging to Keene on display at the [[National Museum of American History]] in Washington, D.C.]]
At this point, she lined up investors, along with an architect who specialized in theaters, and a new theater was constructed to her specifications. Named the Laura Keene's Theatre, it opened on 18 November 1856.  In November 1857 she put on ''[[The Sea of Ice (play)|The Sea of Ice]]'' to financial success.

In 1858, ''[[Our American Cousin]]'' debuted in Laura Keene's Theater. On the night of 14 April 1865, Keene's company, which primarily included John Dyott and [[Harry Hawk]], were performing ''Our American Cousin'' at [[Ford's Theatre]] in [[Washington, D.C.]]. In attendance that night were President [[Abraham Lincoln]] and his wife First Lady [[Mary Todd Lincoln]]. Actor [[John Wilkes Booth]] [[Assassination of Abraham Lincoln|fatally shot]] President Lincoln while Lincoln watched the play from the presidential box; Booth then fled the theatre. Amid the confusion, Keene made her way to the presidential box where Lincoln lay dying and cradled the mortally wounded President's head in her lap.&lt;ref name=oreilly&gt;{{cite book|last=O'Reilly|first=Bill|title=Killing Lincoln: The Shocking Assassination that Changed America Forever|year=2011|publisher=Macmillan|isbn=1-429-99687-0|page=286|author2=Dugard, Martin }}&lt;/ref&gt; President Lincoln's fatal head wound bled on her dress, staining her cuff. The cuff was later donated to the [[National Museum of American History]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Bird|first=William L, Jr.|title=Souvenir Nation: Relics, Keepsakes, and Curios from the Smithsonian's National Museum of American History|year=2013|publisher=Chronicle Books|isbn=1-616-89275-7|page=134}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Stage entertainment turned over quickly in that era, with few productions exceeding a dozen performances, but Keene bucked those odds.  An 1857 show called ''The Elves'' ran for a record 50 performances. Moreover, 1860 was to prove itself an important year for her theater and American drama as well. On 29 March, she premiered [[Dion Boucicault]]'s ''[[The Colleen Bawn]],'' which ran for six weeks until the end of the season on 12 May; the highlight of this play was the creation of an ocean island on stage in a scene which culminated with the hero diving into the ocean to save the colleen bawn Eily O'Connor. (Betting on the play's success, Boucicault took ''The Colleen Bawn'' to London, where it opened on 10 September 1860 and ran for 230 performances, becoming the first long run in the history of English theater.) In November 1860, Keene premiered the musical ''[[The Seven Sisters (play)|The Seven Sisters]],'' which featured extravagant sets and ran for 253 performances, an astonishing total for the time.&lt;ref&gt;Kenrick&lt;/ref&gt;

==Later years and death==
[[File:Laura Keene gravestone at Green-Wood Cemetery (62088).jpg|thumb|Burial site at [[Green-Wood Cemetery]] in Brooklyn, New York.]]
By 1863, Keene was forced to give up managing her own theatre due to poor health.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The American Stage|year=1993|editor1-last=Engle|editor1-first=Ron|editor2-last=Miller|editor2-first=Tice L.|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=0-521-41238-2|page=38}}&lt;/ref&gt; Keene continued as manager and star of a company which toured the United States for most of the next ten years.  She also served as manager of the [[Chestnut Street Theatre]] in [[Philadelphia]], from 20 September 1869, through 25 March 1870.&lt;ref&gt;Creahan 1897 p.32&lt;/ref&gt;  Her final performance was on 4 July 1873, while touring in northern Pennsylvania.

Keene's second husband, John Lutz, died on 18 April 1869.&lt;ref&gt;Creahan 1897 p. 194&lt;/ref&gt; On 4 November 1873, Keene died of [[tuberculosis]] at the age of 47 at [[Montclair, New Jersey]].&lt;ref name=oreilly/&gt; She is buried in [[Green-Wood Cemetery]] in Brooklyn.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Mosca|first=Alexandra Kathryn|title=Nineteenth-century American Women Theatre Managers|date=2008|publisher=Arcadia Publishing|isbn=0-738-55650-5|page=96}}&lt;/ref&gt;

"'''Man on the Moon'''" is a song by the American [[alternative rock]] band [[R.E.M.]], released as the second single from their 1992 album ''[[Automatic for the People]]''. The lyrics were written by lead singer [[Michael Stipe]], and the music by drummer [[Bill Berry]] and guitarist [[Peter Buck]], and credited to the whole band as usual. The song was well received by critics and peaked at number 30 on the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]] and number 18 on the [[UK Singles Chart]]. It remains one of R.E.M.'s most popular songs&lt;ref name=allmusic/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/pictures/readers-poll-the-10-best-r-e-m-songs-20110928|title=Readers Poll: The 10 Best R.E.M. Songs|date=28 September 2011|first=Andy|last=Greene|work=Rolling Stone|accessdate=28 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; and was included on the compilations ''[[In Time: The Best of R.E.M. 1988–2003]]'' and ''[[Part Lies, Part Heart, Part Truth, Part Garbage 1982–2011]]''.

Lyrically, the song is a tribute to the comedian and performer [[Andy Kaufman]] with numerous references to his career including his [[Elvis impersonation]], wrestling, and the film ''[[My Breakfast with Blassie]]''. The song's title and chorus refer to the [[moon landing conspiracy theories]] as an oblique allusion to rumors that Kaufman's death in 1984 was faked. The song gave its name to ''[[Man on the Moon (film)|Man on the Moon]]'' (1999), [[Miloš Forman]]'s film based on Kaufman's life, and was featured prominently in the film's [[Man on the Moon (soundtrack)|soundtrack]].

==Composition==
"Man on the Moon" is a mid-tempo country-rock song following a [[verse–chorus form|verse-chorus structure]] with an added [[Song structure#Pre-chorus|pre-chorus]] and an instrumental [[bridge (music)|bridge]] following the second and third choruses. The song is somewhat unusual in that the verses are unequal in length, with six lines in the first verse but only four in the second and third verses.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title=The Complete Idiot's Guide to the Art of Songwriting | date=2011 | publisher=Alpha Books | location=New York | isbn=978-1-101-54337-5 | author=Kelly, Casey |author2=Hodge, David}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An early instrumental demo of the song was known to the band as "C to D Slide".&lt;ref name="nme.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nme.com/news/music/rem-man-on-the-moon-song-lyrics-meaning-video-interview-2161967|title=REM talk to us about the classic 'Man On The Moon' to mark the single's 25th anniversary|date=21 November 2017|publisher=NME}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Guitarist Peter Buck has explained how the music came together: "'Man on the Moon' was something that Bill [Berry] had, this one chord change that he came in with, which was C to D like the verse of the song, and he said: 'I don't know what to do with that.' I used to finish some of Bill's things... he would come up with the riffs, but I would be the finish guy for that. I sat down and came up with the chorus, the bridges, and so forth. I remember we showed it to Mike and Michael when they came in later; definitely we had the song finished. I think Bill played bass and I played guitar; we kept going around with it. I think we might have played some mandolin on it in the rehearsal studio."

Michael Stipe later explained in an interview with Charlie Rose how the lyrics were written independently of the music, which had no prior association with the song's eventual lyrical content regarding Kaufman. Stipe recounted that the rest of the members of R.E.M. had written and performed the music of the song and recorded it along with the rest of the ''Automatic for the People'' album during studio sessions in Seattle.  As of the final week of the recording sessions, Stipe was still struggling to write lyrics for the song, and the other band members continued to plead with him to finish it.  Stipe attempted to argue that the track should be an instrumental, but his bandmates were insistent.&lt;ref name="nme.com"/&gt;  Stipe listened to the track on a walk around Seattle on his [[Walkman|Walkman cassette player]] and was inspired to write about the performances of entertainer [[Andy Kaufman]].&lt;ref name="npr.org"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.npr.org/sections/allsongs/2017/11/02/561368442/r-e-m-reflects-on-25-years-of-automatic-for-the-people|title=R.E.M. Reflects On 25 Years Of 'Automatic For The People'|date=2 November 2017|publisher=NPR}}&lt;/ref&gt;  After Stipe went back to the studio to complete the vocal track, the master was mixed that night and sent out the following day to be mastered.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|title=R.E.M. - Charlie Rose|url=https://charlierose.com/videos/29670|language=en-US|accessdate=2018-03-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Lyrics==
The song's lyrics do not tell a conventional story, and may instead be seen as a collection of cultural references, images and ideas.  There are repeated mentions of [[Andy Kaufman]], including references to his [[Elvis impersonation]] and work with wrestlers [[Fred Blassie]] and [[Jerry Lawler]]. Some critics find the song also invokes the conspiracy theories surrounding the [[moon landing conspiracy theories|moon landing]] and [[Elvis Presley phenomenon#Postmortem Elvis sightings|Elvis Presley]] as an indirect nod to the persistent rumors that Kaufman [[Andy Kaufman#Illness and death|faked his own death]].&lt;ref name=allmusic&gt;{{cite web | last=Mason | first=Stewart | title=Song review: Man on the Moon | url=http://www.allmusic.com/song/man-on-the-moon-t2817082 | publisher=Allmusic | accessdate=29 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.signature-reads.com/2014/09/memoir-in-a-melody-r-e-m-s-ode-to-andy-kaufman-in-man-on-the-moon/|title=Memoir in a Melody: R.E.M.'s Ode to Andy Kaufman in 'Man On the Moon'|first=Matt|last=Staggs|date=17 September 2014|accessdate=28 June 2017|work=Signature|publisher=Penguin Random House}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Speaking in 2017 to the ''[[NME]]'', Mills explained that the perceived ambiguity of Kaufman's legacy, including questions of whether he was a comedian or a [[performance art]]ist, and whether or not his work was funny or irritating, was a way to frame other questions about life within the song:

&lt;blockquote&gt;He's the perfect ghost to lead you through this tour of questioning things. Did the moon landing really happen? Is Elvis really dead? He was kind of an ephemeral figure at that point so he was the perfect guy to tie all this stuff together as you journey through childhood and touchstones of life.&lt;ref name="nme.com"/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Other lyrical references include persons from the history of science and religion, as well as board-games and the rock band [[Mott the Hoople]] of whom Stipe had been a fan in his youth, and whose music he associated with the years of Kaufman's original television broadcasts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.thesun.co.uk/tvandshowbiz/4932910/michael-stipe-looks-back-at-automatic-for-the-people-25-years-on-and-living-with-the-fear-of-hiv-for-10-years/|title=Michael Stipe looks back at Automatic For The People 25 years on and living with the fear of HIV for 10-years|publisher=The Sun|date=17 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Regarding the cryptic lyrics, critic [[Greg Kot]] wrote that the song "presents a surreal vision of heaven."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last=Kot | first=Greg | title=Killing 'Em Softly | newspaper=Chicago Tribune | date=October 4, 1992}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to [[Ann Powers]], "Mentioning Kaufman in the same breath as Moses and Sir Isaac Newton, Stipe makes a game of human endeavor, insisting that it all ends in dust. 'Let's play [[Twister (game)|Twister]], let's play [[Risk (game)|Risk]],' Stipe jokes to the notables he's invoked. 'I'll see you in heaven if you make the list.'"&lt;ref name=powers&gt;{{cite news | last=Powers | first=Ann | title=A Weary R.E.M. Seems Stuck in Midtempo | url=https://www.nytimes.com/1992/10/11/arts/recordings-view-a-weary-rem-seems-stuck-in-midtempo.html | accessdate=29 January 2012 | newspaper=The New York Times | date=October 11, 1992}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The lyrics to ''Man on the Moon'' also feature a prominent repeated refrain of ''"Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah"''.  Stipe has explained that his friend [[Kurt Cobain]] was in the habit of placing ''"yeah"'' in the lyrics to the songs of his band, [[Nirvana (band)|Nirvana]], and that Stipe intended to outdo him, even to the extent of counting the ''"yeahs"''.&lt;ref name="npr.org"/&gt;

==Release and reception==
"Man on the Moon" was released as the second single from ''Automatic for the People'' on November 21, 1992, reaching number 30 on the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]]&lt;ref name=billboard&gt;{{cite web | title=R.E.M.: Billboard singles | url=http://www.allmusic.com/artist/rem-p116437/charts-awards/billboard-singles | publisher=Allmusic | accessdate=29 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; and number 18 on the [[UK Singles Chart]].&lt;ref name=chartstats&gt;{{cite web | title=Man on the Moon | url=http://www.chartstats.com/release.php?release=20157 | publisher=Chart Stats | accessdate=29 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The song was enthusiastically received by critics. Writing for the ''[[New York Times]]'', [[Ann Powers]] said it "shines with a wit that balances R.E.M.'s somber tendencies."&lt;ref name=powers/&gt; Stewart Mason went even further in his review for [[Allmusic]], calling the song "near-perfect", "almost inarguably Stipe's pinnacle as a singer", and "one of R.E.M.'s most enduring achievements".&lt;ref name=allmusic/&gt; The song was listed at number 19 on the ''[[Village Voice]]'' "[[Pazz &amp; Jop]]" year-end critics' poll in 1993.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=The 1993 Pazz &amp; Jop Critics Poll | url=http://www.robertchristgau.com/xg/pnj/pjres93.php | publisher=Robert Christgau | accessdate=29 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Music video==
The song's video, directed by [[Peter Care]], was shot over three days in the desert, at [[Lancaster, California|Lancaster]] in the [[Antelope Valley]] area of California, in October 1992. Care kept a journal of the unusually long planning, filming, and editing process, which was published by ''Raygun'' magazine and reprinted in the R.E.M. fan club newsletter. It gave a clear idea of the amount of work, money, and attention-to-detail involved.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last=Gray | first=Marcus | title=It Crawled from the South: An R.E.M. Companion | date=1997 | publisher=Da Capo Press | isbn=0-306-80751-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The video depicts [[Michael Stipe]], attired in a cowboy hat, walking along a desert road before leaping onto a passing truck (driven by [[Bill Berry]]) and hitching a ride to a [[truck stop]] where [[Peter Buck]] is tending bar and [[Mike Mills]] is shooting pool. Berry trades his truck seat for a bar stool, and along with a few of the other customers (in the shooting, they used actors and non-actors), sings along during the choruses.  Stipe eats an order of fries, and then leaves and walks back into the desert.  The video is punctuated with moon-related images, including footage of the [[Apollo program|NASA moon landings]], an [[orrery]] in motion and a clip from [[Georges Méliès]]' 1902 film, ''[[A Trip to the Moon]]''.  Television footage of Kaufman wrestling and impersonating Elvis Presley is also shown.

This video, which uses the shorter version instead of the full album version, was ranked #41 on ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' magazine's The 100 Top Music Videos, and has been described as 'iconic' by the ''[[NME]]''{{'s}} Andrew Trendell.&lt;ref name="nme.com"/&gt;

[[File:María Elena Moyano.jpg|right|thumb|María Elena Moyano]]

'''María Elena Moyano Delgado''' (29 November 1958 – February 15, 1992) was a [[Peru]]vian [[Community organizing|community organizer]], feminist and activist of [[Afro-Peruvian]] descent who was assassinated by the [[Maoist]] [[Shining Path]] (''Sendero Luminoso'') Terrorist group. Although only one of many atrocities committed during the most violent period of Peru's modern history, her death resulted in a public outcry.

== Early life ==
Moyano was born in the [[Barranco District|Barranco]] district of [[Lima]]. Her activism began in her teens, as a member of the ''Movimiento de Jóvenes Pobladores,'' a youth movement in [[Villa El Salvador]], a vast [[shanty town|shantytown]] ''([[Pueblos jóvenes|pueblo joven]])'' on the outskirts of the capital, largely populated by migrants from the interior of the country.

In 1984, at age 25, she was elected president of the ''Federación Popular de Mujeres de Villa El Salvador'' (Fepomuves), a federation of women from [[Villa El Salvador]]. Under her leadership, the organization grew to encompass public kitchens, health committees, the ''Vaso de Leche'' program (which supplied children with milk), income-generating projects, and committees for basic education. In 1990, Moyano left her position in Fepomuves and shortly thereafter was elected deputy mayor of the municipality of Villa El Salvador.

Maria Elena Moyano also supported the Organization Vaso de Leche (Glass of Milk). Organization Vaso de Leche organized to deliver milk to Lima's poor neighborhoods so that children could have at least one cup of milk a day.&lt;ref&gt;Moyano, Maria E. The Autobiography of Maria Elena Moyano: The Life and Death of a Peruvian Activist. Trans. Patricia S. Taylo Edmisten. University Press of Florida, 2000. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;

Maria Elena Moyano’s mother laundered clothes for a living, and had seven children.  Moyano grew up with her six siblings: Rodolfo, Raul, Carlos, Narda, Eduardo, and Martha. For many years Maria Elena wanted to be a secretary, but her mother encouraged her to study law. Moyano's husband, Gustavo encouraged her to apply to Garcilaso de la Vega University so she could study sociology. The movie "Courage" (1999) depicted her studying poverty in Peru, and her turn towards secularism and socialism. Moyano believed that soup kitchens were a form of expressing grievances.

== Shining Path in Peru ==
[[Shining Path]], founded by [[Abimael Guzman Reynoso]], was trying to consolidate its hold on the poorer neighborhoods of Lima. They were suspicious of all social organizations in Peru. Shining Path guerrillas planted a bomb on September 9, 1991 in a distribution center and blamed Maria Elena Moyano. Clearly, they falsely accused her in order to silence her.{{citation needed|date=January 2017}}

Fear and terror pushed women (who lived in poverty) to speak up, and get involved in organized groups. The war between Shining Path and the military affected women for most of them were raped by both parts.{{citation needed|date=January 2017}}{{dubious|date=January 2017}} Cholas (the pejorative term for indigenous Peruvian females) were raped the most by men in the military, reported by Robin Kirk on a report she created for the Women’s Rights Project of Human Rights Watch. Shining Path additionally intimidated those that worked in social organizations through death threats, and ultimately killed quite a few.

Guzman, the leader of Shining Path was captured in September 1992. This was during the government of [[Alberto Fujimori]] who suspended the Constitution, dissolved congress and created a tight bond with the military. Under Fujimori’s rule, many were arrested and executed.

Shining Path considered Maria Elena as a conter-revolutionary and as a manipulator. She blamed the leftist movement in Peru for supporting Shining Path. Maria Elena went on to publicly confront Shining Path by calling them terrorists, and no longer revolutionaries. She also confronted the police, accusing them of violence and murders.

In a distributed pamphlet, Shining Path attacked Maria Elena accusing her of cheating, lying, and planting bombs. Maria Elena rebutted each attack by stating that she would never “destroy what [she] has built with [her] own hands.”

On February 14, Maria Elena protested. She was the leader of a march against Shining Path. The people carried white banners as a symbol of peace. After the protest, she was gunned down at fund-raising meal for a group of women.&lt;ref&gt;Shaw, Lisa and Stephanie Dennison. Pop Culture Latin America: Media, Arts and Lifestyle. ABC-CLIO, 2005. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Death ==
After actively confronting Shining Path, she began to contemplate her death. She had good reason since many women activists in Peru were murdered. Maria Antenati Hilario and Margarita Astride de la Cruz were murdered for their attempt at change. Most importantly was the death of Juana Lopez in August 1991, where two weeks later Maria Elena began receiving death threats. The Shining Path began to tell her to leave her post, or she would die.

Shining Path guerrillas assassinated Maria Elena Moyano on February 15, 1992. It was the defiance that Maria Elena Moyano illustrated that triggered her death. She was killed in front of her son: Gustavo and her husband David Pineki (she married him in 1980).

Thousands of people attended her funeral. Later, in a plaza in the center of Villa El Salvador, a statue honoring Moyano was erected, and her autobiography was published.

The assassination of Moyano was one of the last major atrocities carried out by Shining Path. In September 1992, Guzmán was arrested and the leadership of the organization fell shortly thereafter. Subsequently, Shining Path was largely eradicated.

Moyano has been honored through a film after her death: Coraje (Courage). The film was written and directed by Alberto Durant.

A country filled with violence, inequality and danger; Maria Elena Moyano proved to be a signal of hope when approximately 300,000 people accompanied her coffin.

'''Ottoman wars in Asia''' refers to the wars involving the [[Ottoman Empire]] in Asia. Ottoman Empire was founded at the beginning of the 14th century. Its original settlement was in the north west [[Anatolia]] (Asiatic part of the modern [[Turkey]]) where it was a small [[Anatolian beyliks|beylik]] (principality). Its main rival was [[Byzantine Empire]]. In 1350s Ottomans were able to cross the [[Dardanelles]] strait and eventually they conquered whole south east Europe. Although they mainly concentrated on Europe, they also fought in Asia.

==Wars against other beyliks==
In the early years of the 14th century,  there were many [[Anatolian beyliks|Turkish beyliks]] in Anatolia. The first Ottoman sultan (then known as bey) [[Osman I]] was careful not to provoke the neighbouring beyliks. Second sultan [[Orhan I|Orhan]] was the very first Ottoman ruler who was engaged in a war against other beyliks. He annexed the territory of [[Karesi]] beylik, another beylik to the south of Ottoman beylik.&lt;ref&gt;İnalcık, p.52&lt;/ref&gt; His son [[Murad I]] established hegemony on most of the beyliks in Anatolia mainly by diplomacy (dowery, purchase etc.) &lt;ref&gt;İnalcık, p.95-96&lt;/ref&gt; [[Bayezid I]] continued expansion policy by harsher methods. At the end of the 14th century most beyliks were incorporated into Ottoman realm. However, in 1402, Beyazıt was defeated by [[Timur]], a [[Turkic people|Turkic]] conqueror from [[Turkestan]] in the [[Battle of Ankara]] and the newly annexed beyliks (except Karesi) regained their independence.&lt;ref&gt;Agoston-Masters, p.82&lt;/ref&gt; During the reigns of [[Mehmed I]], [[Murad II]] and [[Mehmed II]] (the Conqueror), Ottomans reconquered all beyliks with the exception of two, which were the vassals of Mamluk Empire in Egypt.

==Wars against Christian principalities in Anatolia==
During Ottoman expansion, there were only three important Christian territories; [[Cilician Kingdom of Armenia]] in [[Çukurova]] (Cilicia in south Turkey) was conquered by the Mamluks of Egypt in 1375 and [[İzmir]], a part of [[Knights Hospitaller]], was captured by Timur in 1402.&lt;ref&gt;Jorga, p.291&lt;/ref&gt; Ottomans captured İzmir from [[Aydın Beylik]]. [[Empire of Trebizond]] in east [[Black Sea region]] was conquered by Mehmed II in 1461.&lt;ref&gt;İnalcık, p.185&lt;/ref&gt; There were also some Christian ([[Republic of Genoa]], [[Republic of Venice]]) forts some of  which were in alliance with [[Karaman Beylik]]. When Ottomans conquered Karaman, the most important beylik, during the reign of Mehmed II, these forts also fell to Ottoman Empire.

==Wars against Turkmens in eastern Anatolia==
Towards the end of the 14th century east of [[Central Anatolia]] was under the hegemony of a [[Oghuz Turk|Turkmen]] leader named [[Kadı Burhaneddin]]. Bayezid I tried to conquer his territory without success. After his death and the shorth-term [[Timurid Empire|Timurid]] rule,  Ottomans faced with a more powerful rival. In the 15th century tribes in the east, were united into a tribal confederation named [[Akkoyunlu]] (Turkish phrase meaning "White Sheep"). In 1473, Mehmed II defeated Akkoyunlu sultan [[Uzun Hasan]] in the [[Battle of Otlukbeli]].&lt;ref&gt;İnalcık, p177-178&lt;/ref&gt; After this battle all of the Central Anatolia and parts of [[East Anatolia]] became Ottoman possessions.

==Wars against Mamluk Egypt==
[[Egypt]] was under the rule of a military cast named [[Mamluk Sultanate (Cairo)|Mamluks]]. Mamluks were actually [[Turkish people|Turks]] and [[Circassians]]. Ottomans were unable to defeat Mamluks in the initial clashes during the reign of [[Beyazıt II]]. However the Mamluks supported Safavid Persia against the Ottomans and this give the Ottoman sultan [[Selim I]] (the Grim) the necessary cause to wage a war to Egypt. His grand vizier [[Hadim Sinan Pasha]] defeated [[Dulkadir Beylik]] in [[Southeast Anatolia]], a Mamluk vassal in 1516. [[Ramazan Beylik]], the other Mamluk vassal in Çukurova  (Cilicia) voluntarily accepted the Ottoman suzerainty. During Selim’s long campaign to Egypt in 1516-18, Mamluks were defeated three times;  in the [[Battle of Marj Dabiq]], the [[Battle of Yaunis Khan]] and the [[Battle of Ridanieh]] (The first and the third personally commanded by Selim and the second by Hadim Sinan Pasha). [[Syria]], [[Palestine (region)|Palestine]], [[Jordan]] and [[Lebanon]] as well as Egypy fell under Ottoman domination. [[Hejaz]] region (of [[Saudi Arabia]]) voluntarily accepted Ottoman suzerainty.&lt;ref&gt;Jorga Vol 2, p.283-286&lt;/ref&gt;

==Wars against Safavid Persia==
{{main article|Ottoman–Persian Wars}}
After the death of Uzun Hasan of Akkoyunlu, [[Ismail I]] of [[Safavid]] house began controlling [[Persia]] and East Anatolia. Sect differences between the two countries led to a war. In 1514 Selim I defeated Persian army in the [[Battle of Chaldiran]] and annexed most of East Anatolia. War continued during the reign of [[Suleyman I]] (the Magnificent) . Three of Suleyman’s campaigns were directed to Persia. (1534–35, 1548–49, 1553–55) The war ended by the [[Treaty of Amasya]] in 1555. Whole East Anatolia as well as mid and north [[Iraq]] became parts of the Ottoman Empire. Meanwhile, south Iraq fell voluntarily to Ottoman suzerainty. Ottomans annexed most of West Iran and [[Caucasus]] by the [[Treaty of Ferhat Pasha]] at the end of the renewed war of 1578-1590  during the reign of [[Murad III]]. But, after the attack of [[Abbas I of Persia|Shah Abbas]] of Persia, they had to abandon their 1590-gains by the [[Treaty of Nasuh Pasha]] in 1612 during the reign of [[Ahmed I]]. In 1623, Persians also captured [[Baghdad]] in mid Iraq, but [[Murad IV]] recaptured the city in 1639.&lt;ref&gt;Agaston-Masters, p.280&lt;/ref&gt; At the end of the war the present western borderline of Iran was drawn by the  [[Treaty of Zuhab]].

==Further Persian wars==
During [[Afsharid]] and [[Qajar]] dynasties of Persia, Ottomans fought against Persia numerous times with relatively little changes in the gained and lost territories except during the reign of [[Nader Shah]], when large territories were abandoned to Persia but were recovered upon his death. At the end of the wars, with the last one ending in 1823, the border line drawn was almost the same as that of the Treaty of Zuhab. (Present Turkey-Iran and Iraq-Iran border lines.)&lt;ref&gt;Agoston-Masters, p.281-282&lt;/ref&gt;

==Naval wars in the Indian Ocean==
{{Main article|Ottoman naval expeditions in the Indian Ocean}}
In 1538, Suleyman I sent a navy to the Indian Ocean. Although [[Hadım Suleiman Pasha]], the captain of the navy failed to capture any bridgehead in India, he captured [[Aden]] and most of [[Yemen]]. A few years later, a [[Portuguese Navy]] tried to dominate in the [[Red Sea]] after Süleyman Pasha's return. However Ottoman captain  [[Piri Reis]] (an important cartographer of the 16th century) defeated the navy and restored the Ottoman dominance in the Red Sea in 1548. In 1552, he captured [[Muscat, Oman|Muscat]] and the south coasts of [[Arabian Peninsula]]. Later he also captured small forts in the [[Persian Gulf]].&lt;ref&gt;Lord Kinross, p.237-240&lt;/ref&gt; Ottoman dominance on most of Arabian Peninsula continued up to 20th century.

==Napoleonic wars==
{{Main article|Siege of Acre (1799)}}
General [[Napoleon Bonaparte]] of [[France]] invaded Egypt in 1798 and tried to annex Palestine as well. He easily captured [[Jaffa]]. His next target was [[Acre, Israel|Acre]] (now in north Israel) for the city controlled the route between Syria and Egypt. But after the stubborn defense of the city under the governor [[Cezzar Ahmet Pasha]] he had to retreat.&lt;ref&gt;Agaston Masters p.10&lt;/ref&gt;

==Aftermath==
{{main article|Treaty of Sèvres}}
{{unreferenced-section|date=November 2016}}
After the Treaty of Zuhab in 1638, Ottoman Empire was able to keep the Asiatic territories up to the 20th century except for the disputable territories of the south and east coasts of the Arabian Peninsula. In the early years of the  20th century the main problem was the rebel in Yemen which was subdued. Ottoman Empire fought against the [[Allies of World War I|Allies]] in the First World War and was defeated. According to [[Armistice of Mudros]] Ottoman Empire accepted the loss of all territories in the Arabian Peninsula, Syria, Palestine, Jordan, Lebanon and most of Iraq. Although Turkey and North Iraq were still under Ottoman rule, soon Allies occupied the Mediterranean coast and North Iraq. They also offered [[Aegean Sea|Aegean]] coast (as well as [[Thrace]]) to Greece and eastern Anatolia to newly establiahed [[Armenia]] by the [[Treaty of Sèvres]].  However the treaty became ineffective during the [[Turkish War of Independence]]. At the end of the war the Ottoman Empire ceased to exist in 1922. The newly established Turkish Republic kept Mediterranean and Aegean coasts as well as the Eastern Anatolia by the [[Treaty of Lausanne]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4003">The '''passivation''' of a [[spacecraft]] is the removal of any internal energy contained in the vehicle at the end of its mission or useful life.&lt;ref name=ss20111205/&gt; Spent [[upper stage]]s are generally passivated after their use as launch vehicles is complete, as are [[satellite]]s when they [[:Category:Derelict satellites orbiting Earth|can no longer be utilized]] for their initial design purpose.  

==Overview==
For satellites in [[geosynchronous orbit]], both the [[International Telecommunications Union]] (ITU) and [[United Nations]] (UN) recommend that GEO-satellites be designed such that they can, at end of life, remove themselves to a [[graveyard orbit|disposal orbit]] some {{convert|350|km}} above the [[geostationary orbit|GEO]] belt, and then passivate themselves by removing any internally stored energy. "There is no [international] enforcement of these recommendations" but the majority of these GEO spacecraft are being boosted up into the recommended [[graveyard orbit]]s.&lt;ref name="ss20111205"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thespaceshow.com/show/05-dec-2011/broadcast-1666-special-edition|title=Broadcast 1666 (Special Edition) - Topic: Space debris issues|last=Johnson|first=Nicholas|date=2011-12-05|editor-last=Livingston|editor-first=David|website=|publisher=[[The Space Show]]|at=1:03:05–1:06:20|type=podcast|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|accessdate=2015-01-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;  

The largest component of internally stored energy is generally unused [[propellant]],&lt;ref name=ss20111205/&gt; although [[Battery (electricity)|batteries]] are also important sources of stored energy that require passivation.&lt;ref name="bonnal2007"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Bonnal|first=Christophe|date=|year=2007|title=Design and operational practices for the passivation of spacecraft and launchers at the end of life|url=http://pig.sagepub.com/content/221/6/925.abstract|journal=Journal of Aerospace Engineering|volume=|pages=|doi=10.1243/09544100JAERO231|issn=2041-3025|accessdate=2012-12-18|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Empirical history has shown that stored energy that is not dissipated can often become an [[energy]] source for initiating an [[explosion]] or fragmentation, resulting in unwanted manmade [[space debris]].&lt;ref name=ss20111205/&gt;&lt;ref name=bonnal2007/&gt;

Within national regimes, where national governments can control the [[launch license]]s of launch vehicles and spacecraft, there are some enforceable requirements for passivation.  

The [[Federal government of the United States|US government]] has implemented a set of standard practices for both civilian ([[NASA]]) and military ([[United States Department of Defense|DoD]]/[[USAF]]) orbital debris mitigation that require passivation.  "All on-board sources of stored energy of a spacecraft or upper stage should be depleted or safed when they are no longer required for mission operations or postmission disposal. Depletion should occur as soon as such an operation does not pose an unacceptable risk to the [[payload]]. Propellant depletion burns and compressed gas releases should be designed to minimize the probability of subsequent accidental collision and to minimize the impact of a subsequent accidental explosion."&lt;ref name="us20131128"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://orbitaldebris.jsc.nasa.gov/library/USG_OD_Standard_Practices.pdf|title=U.S. Government Orbital Debris Mitigation Standard Practices|last=|first=|date=|website=[[NASA]]|publisher=United States Federal Government|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|accessdate=2013-11-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://orbitaldebris.jsc.nasa.gov/library/references.html|title=Orbital Debris – Important Reference Documents|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=NASA Orbital Debris Program Office|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160702025151/http://orbitaldebris.jsc.nasa.gov/library/references.html|archive-date=2016-07-02|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Paul Brandon Gilbert''' (born November 6, 1966), is an American [[hard rock]]/[[Heavy metal music|heavy metal]] guitarist. He is best known for being the co-founder of the band [[Mr. Big (American band)|Mr. Big]]. He was also a member of [[Racer X (band)|Racer X]], with whom he released several albums. Following Mr. Big's disbandment in 1996, Gilbert launched a solo career, for which he has released numerous solo albums, and featured in numerous collaborations and guest appearances on other musicians' albums.

Gilbert has been voted fourth-best on GuitarOne magazine's "Top 10 Greatest Guitar [[shred guitar|Shredders]] of All Time".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Top Shredders of all Time|url=http://www.randyciak.com/guitar/top_shredders_of_all_time.htm|publisher=Randy Ciak|accessdate=16 April 2011|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080309115203/http://www.randyciak.com/guitar/top_shredders_of_all_time.htm|archive-date=9 March 2008|dead-url=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;  He has also ranked in  ''[[Guitar World]]'s'' "50 Fastest Guitarists of All Time" list.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=50 Fastest Guitarists of All Time|url=http://www.guitarworld.com/article/50_fastest_guitarists_of_all_time?page=0%2C1|publisher=GuitarWorld|accessdate=16 April 2011|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110511224414/http://www.guitarworld.com/article/50_fastest_guitarists_of_all_time?page=0%2C1|archivedate=11 May 2011|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Shrapnel Records==
Gilbert was raised mostly in the small [[Pittsburgh]] suburb of [[Greensburg, Pennsylvania]].&lt;ref name="glauber"&gt;{{cite web |first=Gary |last=Glauber |date=May 20, 2005 |title=Paul Gilbert: Space Ship One |publisher=[[PopMatters]] |url=http://www.popmatters.com/pm/review/gilbertpaul-space |accessdate=October 28, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; He began playing music at age five; by age 15, he was touring local clubs with his band (Tau Zero), and had been featured in [[Guitar Player]] magazine (alongside fellow up-and-comer [[Yngwie Malmsteen]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Jason Ankeny |url=http://www.allmusic.com/artist/paul-gilbert-mn0000747761/biography |title=Paul Gilbert &amp;#124; Biography |publisher=AllMusic |date=1966-11-06 |accessdate=2014-07-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; Around 1981, Gilbert first contacted [[Mike Varney]] (founder of [[Shrapnel Records]]), asking for a gig with metal mega-star [[Ozzy Osbourne]]. At the time, Varney couldn't think why Osbourne would want a 15-year-old guitarist; but, after listening to Gilbert's demo tape, he changed his mind. They continued talking over the next 3 years, culminating in Gilbert's 1984 cross-country move to [[Los Angeles]] to attend the [[Musicians Institute|GIT]] (Guitar Institute of Technology). Even at the young age of 17, Gilbert quickly became a local legend due to his advanced alternate picking technique, record-breaking speed, his young age, and his massive repertoire of cover material. He was hired as a GIT instructor in 1985, and recorded Racer X's debut album ''[[Street Lethal]]'' soon after.

==Racer X==
Formed in [[Los Angeles]] in 1985, [[Racer X (band)|Racer X]] was originally composed of Paul Gilbert (lead guitar), [[Juan Alderete]] (bass guitar), [[Harry Gschoesser]] (drums), and [[Jeff Martin (American musician)|Jeff Martin]] (vocals). They were heavily influenced by [[Judas Priest]], and Gilbert's playing was reminiscent of [[Yngwie Malmsteen]], displaying fast-driven solos with extreme-level technique. Gschoesser was replaced by [[Scott Travis]] (who would later become [[Judas Priest]]'s drummer) in 1986, and [[Bruce Bouillet]], one of Gilbert's private students at GIT, was added as a second guitarist after demonstrating an ability to harmonize Gilbert's string skipping sequences.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZi1hziHT-0|title=Bruce Bouillet Interview - The Double Stop Podcast Ep. 32|language=en|access-date=2017-04-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Gilbert gained recognition as one of the world's fastest guitarists due to incredibly technical pieces like "Technical Difficulties", "Frenzy", "Scarified", "Y.R.O." and "Scit Scat Wah". Around this time, Gilbert also recorded his first instructional video, ''Intense Rock'', in which he demonstrated a number of his famous techniques and practice regimens in detail. Throughout his career he would go on to release many more instructional videos.

Racer X toured the American southwest, primarily the state of [[California]], and would often sell out thousand-seat venues. Despite their rigorous fan base, the band did not have prospects for a major label deal and Gilbert became increasingly disinterested. In 1987, he was approached by Talas bassist [[Billy Sheehan]], one of his biggest influences, about forming a band that would eventually become [[Mr. Big (American band)|Mr. Big]].

Gilbert left Racer X in 1988, but reformed it after the 1996 breakup of Mr. Big.  Paul contacted the members of Racer X, and all agreed to return with the exception of Bruce Bouillet, who could barely play guitar at the time due to a severe bout of carpal tunnel syndrome. In mid-1999, the band recorded the album [[Technical Difficulties (Racer X album)|Technical Difficulties]] which went [[Music recording sales certification#List of international sales certification thresholds|gold]] in Japan.  Racer X's new record label requested a follow-up; so, in late 2000, they released ''[[Superheroes (Racer X album)|Superheroes]]'', mixed by Bouillet.

To further capitalize on their new-found success in Japan, Universal Japan requested that the band perform for a live-album CD and DVD. On May 25, 2001, the band played their first live performance in thirteen years, to a sold-out crowd, at the world-famous "The Whisky" ([[Whisky a Go Go]]) in Los Angeles. The resulting [[CD]] and [[DVD]] were released in 2002 under the title ''[[Snowball of Doom (album)|Snowball of Doom]]''.

In January 2002, in support of Superheroes and Snowball of Doom, Racer X toured [[Japan]] and [[Taiwan]]. The band performed these shows in their Superheroes costumes.  The tour's final show, in [[Yokohama]], was hastily recorded in two tracks on the sound board and later released as [[Snowball of Doom 2 (album)|Snowball of Doom 2]]. Later that year, [[Universal Music Group|Universal Japan]] pushed for another Racer X release. In October 2002, all four members of Racer X gathered at Gilbert's house in [[Las Vegas Valley|Las Vegas]] to record ''[[Getting Heavier (album)|Getting Heavier]]'', which was sold alongside ''Snowball of Doom 2'' in a package deal. Although the album was a successful release in Japan, some fans were disappointed with the lighter tracks, which resembled a Paul Gilbert solo album more than a conventional Racer X album.

Racer X performed at the 2009 [[NAMM]] show at the Anaheim Convention Center in Anaheim, California. [[Andy Timmons]] and his band opened the show, followed by a solo set from Paul Gilbert, and finally Racer X. The Racer X lineup consisted of Paul Gilbert, [[Scott Travis]], [[Jeff Martin (American musician)|Jeff Martin]] and [[John Alderete]].&lt;ref name="ultimate-guitar.com"&gt;{{cite web|title=Racer X To Perform At NAMM|url=http://www.ultimate-guitar.com/news/upcoming_tours/racer_x_to_perform_at_namm.html|publisher=UltimateGuitar.com|accessdate=16 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Mr. Big==
When bass guitarist [[Billy Sheehan]] left [[David Lee Roth]]'s solo band in 1988, he and Gilbert co-founded [[Mr. Big (band)|Mr. Big]] which included [[Pat Torpey]] on drums and [[Eric Martin (singer)|Eric Martin]] on vocals.  The band was initially successful in Japan, but achieved international stardom with the 1991 release of their second studio album ''[[Lean into It]]''. This album featured the acoustic ballad "[[To Be with You]]" which received strong play on radio stations and [[MTV]], rising to #1 on the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]].

Mr. Big broke up in 1996, at which point Gilbert launched his solo career.  When Mr. Big reformed soon after, Gilbert, who was already committed to his own record contract, was replaced by [[Richie Kotzen]].  Mr. Big disbanded again in 2002, but Gilbert reunited the original members in June 2009 for a worldwide reunion tour. The band recorded a new album with producer [[Kevin Shirley]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=MR. BIG Begins Recording New Album|url=http://www.roadrunnerrecords.com/blabbermouth.net/news.aspx?mode=Article&amp;newsitemID=146635|archive-url=https://archive.is/20120913104458/http://www.roadrunnerrecords.com/blabbermouth.net/news.aspx?mode=Article&amp;newsitemID=146635|dead-url=yes|archive-date=13 September 2012|publisher=Blabbermouth|accessdate=16 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; titled ''[[What If... (Mr. Big album)|What If...]]''. The album was released in Japan on Dec. 15th, 2010, in Europe on Jan. 21st, 2011 and in the U.S. in Feb. 2011. A tour to support the album kicked off at the [[Hollywood]] location of The [[House of Blues]] on April 2, 2011 followed by several dates in Japan. In May and June 2011, the tour continued in [[Taiwan]], China, Korea, The Philippines, and Europe.

In September 2014, Mr. Big released ''[[...The Stories We Could Tell]]'', produced by Pat Regan.  During the recording of the album, it was revealed that drummer [[Pat Torpey]] was dealing with the symptoms of [[Parkinson's Disease]].  For the tour that followed, Mr. Big enlisted the help of drummer [[Matt Starr]] to provide assistance to Torpey, who remained onstage to play percussion and sing backup vocals for more than half the set.  The band is said to be in talks to record and release a new record of original songs in 2017.

==Other projects==
[[File:Paul Gilbert 1.jpg|thumb|right|230px|Gilbert performing on March 2, 2007]]
In May 2003 Gilbert performed twice with the project [[Yellow Matter Custard]], a [[Beatles]] [[cover band]] consisting also of [[Mike Portnoy]] (ex-[[Dream Theater]]), [[Neal Morse]] (ex-[[Spock's Beard]]), and [[Matt Bissonette]]. In February 2011, Yellow Matter Custard reformed for three shows across America. [[Kasim Sulton]] replaced Matt Bissonette for these shows due to other commitments. The band took their name from a [[Beatles]] lyric in the song "[[I Am the Walrus]]": "Yellow matter custard, dripping from a dead dog's eye".

Gilbert rejoined Portnoy along with [[Dave LaRue]] and [[Daniel Gildenlöw]] for a [[Led Zeppelin]] tribute band called Hammer of the Gods in November 2003. The same year, Gilbert toured Japan with [[Linus Of Hollywood]], [[TJ Helmerich]], and [[Scot Coogan]] in support of his solo albums ''[[Burning Organ]]'', ''[[Paul the Young Dude/The Best of Paul Gilbert]]'', and ''[[Gilbert Hotel]]''. In September 2005, he joined Portnoy, [[Sean Malone]], and Jason McMaster in the Rush tribute band Cygnus and the Sea Monsters.  In May 2006, he joined Portnoy, [[Gary Cherone]], and [[Billy Sheehan]] to form ''Amazing Journey: A Tribute to [[The Who]]'', playing three shows. The band (excluding Sheehan) destroyed their equipment after the show in homage.

Gilbert was revealed to be the guest guitarist on the 2007 [[Neal Morse]] solo album ''[[Sola Scriptura (album)|Sola Scriptura]]''. That same year, Gilbert toured with [[Bruce Bouillet]] to promote Gilbert's first instrumental album ''[[Get Out of My Yard]]''. Joining him on tour was Gilbert's wife Emi on keyboards. Gilbert also joined [[Joe Satriani]] and [[John Petrucci]] on the 2007 [[G3 tour]]. This was the fifth North American G3 run and the 12th tour worldwide since its inception.

On January 23, 2008 Gilbert released an instrumental album titled ''[[Silence Followed by a Deafening Roar]]''. The album was released in Europe on March 31, 2008 and in America on April 8, 2008. This was Gilbert's second instrumental album.

On October 22, 2008, Gilbert released an album with vocalist Freddie Nelson entitled ''[[United States (Paul Gilbert album)|United States]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Paul Gilbert and Freddie Nelson - United States|url=http://www.paulgilbert.com/andFreddieNelson.html|publisher=PaulGilbert.com|accessdate=16 April 2011|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110715053643/http://www.paulgilbert.com/andFreddieNelson.html|archivedate=15 July 2011|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The collaboration has been described as a cross between [[Queen (band)|Queen]] and [[Mr. Big (band)|Mr. Big]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=PAUL GILBERT, FREDDIE NELSON Collaborative Effort 'United States' Out Now - Oct. 24, 2008|url=http://www.roadrunnerrecords.com/blabbermouth.net/news.aspx?mode=Article&amp;newsitemID=107554|publisher=Blabbermouth|accessdate=16 April 2011|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081029032959/http://www.roadrunnerrecords.com/blabbermouth.net/news.aspx?mode=Article&amp;newsitemID=107554|archivedate=29 October 2008|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Gilbert performed with [[Racer X (band)|Racer X]] at the 2009 [[NAMM]] show at the Anaheim Convention Center in [[Anaheim, California]]. [[Andy Timmons]] and his band opened the show, followed by a solo set from Gilbert, and finally Racer X. This Racer X lineup consisted of Gilbert, [[Scott Travis]], [[Jeff Martin (American musician)|Jeff Martin]] and [[John Alderete]].&lt;ref name="ultimate-guitar.com"/&gt;

Gilbert also joined [[George Lynch (musician)|George Lynch]] and [[Richie Kotzen]] on the Guitar Generation tour.

On June 30, 2010, Gilbert's new album ''[[Fuzz Universe]]'' was released in Japan, with a release in America and Europe soon after.&lt;ref name="paulgilbert.com"&gt;{{cite web|title=Fuzz Universe|url=http://www.paulgilbert.com/Fuzz_Universe.html|publisher=PaulGilbert.com|accessdate=16 April 2011|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110715053924/http://www.paulgilbert.com/Fuzz_Universe.html|archivedate=15 July 2011|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was Gilbert's third instrumental solo album.&lt;ref name="paulgilbert.com"/&gt; A cover version of Johnny Cash's "Leave That Junk Alone" was featured as a Japanese bonus track.&lt;ref name="paulgilbert.com"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Guitar Generation|url=http://abrowndudedesign.com/GuitarGeneration/email.htm|publisher=Abrowndudedesign.com|accessdate=16 April 2011|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110811022657/http://abrowndudedesign.com/GuitarGeneration/email.htm|archivedate=11 August 2011|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On June 25, 2014 Gilbert released his latest studio album ''[[Stone Pushing Uphill Man]]''. Initially only available in Japan,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.paulgilbert.com/news/2014/6/25/new-album-out-in-japan|title=NEW ALBUM OUT IN JAPAN!!!|work=Paul Gilbert|accessdate=20 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; the album was eventually released in the [[United States]] on August 12, 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.paulgilbert.com/news/2014/8/12/stone-pushing-uphill-man-released|title=Stone Pushing Uphill Man Released!|work=Paul Gilbert|accessdate=20 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Gilbert is currently the Rock Guitar instructor for [[ArtistWorks]], an online music school.&lt;ref&gt;https://artistworks.com/guitar-lessons-paul-gilbert&lt;/ref&gt;

==Influences and style==
When interviewed about his musical and stylistic influences, Paul Gilbert mentions many different artists, including: [[Randy Rhoads]], [[Kim Mitchell]], [[Eddie Van Halen]], [[Yngwie Malmsteen]], [[Tony Iommi]], [[Alex Lifeson]], [[Jimmy Page]], [[Johnny Ramone]], [[Robin Trower]], [[Ritchie Blackmore]], [[Pat Travers]], [[Gary Moore]], [[Michael Schenker]], [[Judas Priest]], [[Akira Takasaki]], [[Steve Clark]], [[Jimi Hendrix]], [[Kiss (band)|Kiss]], and [[The Ramones]]. On many occasions, Gilbert has stated that his uncle Jimi Kidd was vital in heavily fueling Gilbert's childhood interest in playing guitar. Gilbert grew up a great fan of [[Todd Rundgren]], [[Cheap Trick]] and [[The Beatles]], artists who frequently influence his songwriting style.&lt;ref name="BraveWordsInterview"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Wright|first1=Jeb|title=PAUL GILBERT On RACER X - "Growing Up A BEATLES Fan, I Couldn't Help But Put Some Love Into The Chords"|url=http://bravewords.com/news/paul-gilbert-on-racer-x-growing-up-a-beatles-fan-i-couldnt-help-but-put-some-love-into-the-chords|website=BraveWords|accessdate=5 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; He stated on the Space Ship Live DVD that [[George Harrison]] is one of his favorite guitar players. ''[[Guitar World]]'' magazine declared him one of 50 of the world's fastest guitarists of all time, along with [[Buckethead]], [[Eddie Van Halen]], and [[Yngwie Malmsteen]].

Paul Gilbert composes music in a wide variety of styles, including [[Pop music|pop]], [[Rock and roll|rock]], [[Metal music|metal]], [[blues]], and [[funk]]. However, Gilbert is perhaps best known for his [[shred guitar|fast playing speed]] and stylistic versatility. He is noted in particular for his efficient, [[staccato]]-like [[Guitar picking|picking]] technique. He combines fast picking and [[legato]] techniques in the same phrase, usually instinctively. When teaching/demonstrating a particular phrase, he has to think about what he is actually doing with his right hand in order to explain it. Despite being famous for his heavy metal work and his rapid right hand ability, Gilbert has since dissociated himself from that style of playing, instead gravitating towards blues and melodic ideas.

==Instructional career==
Paul Gilbert wrote his own section of the British guitar magazine, ''[[Total Guitar]]'', where he normally demonstrated guitar techniques in the magazine and accompanying CD. Even before that, he contributed instructional articles to Guitar Player Magazine in a late 1980s/early 1990s series entitled "Terrifying Guitar 101". His period of working with ''Total Guitar'' spanned 31 issues until the November 2006 issue. Gilbert also teaches at the [[Musician's Institute|Guitar Institute of Technology]] (GIT) regularly, and is also an "honorary dean" of the GIT division in Japan. Gilbert visits Japan, enjoying the lifestyle like his Shrapnel labelmate [[Marty Friedman (musician)|Marty Friedman]], who still lives in Japan and speaks Japanese fluently. Gilbert is known for his instructional videos, which are often comical in nature. One of his instructional videos includes him pulling a rabbit out of his guitar, putting his guitar in a [[straitjacket]] and having presents thrown at him by members of the film crew. Gilbert also was, for a short time, the guitar teacher of [[Buckethead]], [[Joey Tafolla]], [[Russ Parrish]] (A.K.A. Satchel from [[Steel Panther]]), [[Michelle Meldrum]] (The late wife of [[Europe (band)|Europe]] guitarist [[John Norum]]) and [[Nicole Couch]] of [[Phantom Blue]]. Gilbert now writes a column for ''[[Premier Guitar]]'' entitled "Shred Your Enthusiasm". In May, 2012 he launched the Online Rock Guitar School with Paul Gilbert as a part of the ArtistWorks Guitar Campus.

In August 2014, Gilbert participated in the G4 Experience—a week-long guitar camp—with fellow guitarists [[Joe Satriani]], [[Andy Timmons]], and multi-instrumentalist [[Mike Keneally]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://g4experience.com/ |title=4 Days of Guitar Pleasure |publisher=The G4 Experience |date=2013-10-17 |accessdate=2014-04-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Equipment==
[[File:Paul Gilbert .jpg|thumb|200px|left|Gilbert playing his signature guitar 2007]]
Paul Gilbert primarily uses his [[Ibanez]] PGM signature series guitars,&lt;ref name="SignatureGuitars"&gt;{{cite web|title=Paul Gilbert Signature Electric Guitars|url=http://www.ibanez.com/products/eg_sig_series16.php?year=2016&amp;area_id=3&amp;cat_id=1&amp;series_id=18|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160129162611/http://www.ibanez.com/products/eg_sig_series16.php?year=2016&amp;area_id=3&amp;cat_id=1&amp;series_id=18|dead-url=yes|archive-date=29 January 2016|website=Ibanez Guitars|accessdate=27 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; identified by the unique painted on "F-holes". Although earlier PGM models featured the Ibanez Lo-Pro/Edge double locking tremolo system, many of his guitars (such as his main PGM300) were modified to accommodate a fixed bridge after he stopped using whammy bars in the early 90s, hence the Ibanez PGM301 guitar. Along with his signature guitars, Gilbert often uses his sticker-covered "Dino" Ibanez RG750, in addition to a wide variety of Ibanez solidbody and semi-hollow electric guitars. Recently, Gilbert has been using Ibanez "Fireman" (a reversed-body [[Ibanez Iceman]] with single-coil pickups and an extra cutaway) guitars, which he designed himself.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ibanez.co.jp/japan/news/f_products/2009/Fireman/index.html |title=Fireman &amp;#124; Ibanez Guitars |language=ja |publisher=Ibanez.co.jp |date= |accessdate=2014-07-15 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20120801155905/http://www.ibanez.co.jp/japan/news/f_products/2009/Fireman/index.html |archivedate=2012-08-01 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; A red version The Ibanez Fireman is to be mass-produced for consumers at a more affordable price than the Ibanez PGMFRM1 (current Paul Gilbert signature Fireman) in Fall 2011. Gilbert now has a short (22.2 inch) scale signature guitar - the Ibanez PGMM31 based on the existing Ibanez Mikro range &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.ibanez.com/products/eg_detail17.php?year=2017&amp;area_id=3&amp;cat_id=1&amp;series_id=18&amp;data_id=384&amp;color=CL01 |title=Archived copy |access-date=2017-03-07 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170308144124/http://www.ibanez.com/products/eg_detail17.php?year=2017&amp;area_id=3&amp;cat_id=1&amp;series_id=18&amp;data_id=384&amp;color=CL01 |archive-date=2017-03-08 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Regarding amplifiers, Gilbert used A/DA preamps (A/DA MP-1) and rack effects units early in his career prior to switching to [[Laney Amplification|Laney]] amplifiers. He praised the Laney amps as having ''"the best natural [[Distortion (music)|distorted sound]] of any tube amp ever heard"'' Since the G3 2007 tour however, Gilbert stated that playing with Joe Satriani and John Petrucci inspired him to take a closer look at his own guitar sound. As a result of his search he found the [[Marshall Amplification|Marshall]] Vintage Modern series. He currently uses the Marshall Vintage Modern 2266c combo amps. Gilbert now uses the Marshall JMD:1 (specifically JMD501) amplifier along with his Vintage Modern amplifier. Gilbert uses Jim Dunlop Tortex picks, of which he prefers the orange (.60mm) picks.
As far as cables Gilbert uses&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bulletcable.com |title=Expert Sound Disguised As Cool Stuff |publisher=Bullet Cable |date= |accessdate=2014-07-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bullet Cable 30' Coiled Cables, Bullet Cable SLUG DIY solderless patch cables for his pedalboard and effects.

Gilbert also used a modified vintage A/DA Flanger from the 1980s (source: Berlin VIP session interview). You can hear it on tracks like 'Bucket of Rocks', and he also uses it on the 'Snowball of Doom' DVD. Gilbert stated the flanger had been modified. He would set the flanger to self oscillate, which would make the pitch of the resulting signal alternate up and down to create a sound similar to a dive bomb or a pull up on a whammy bar. Unfortunately, during Gilbert's 2008 European tour, his original A/DA Flanger broke. Thankfully, before the pedal broke, he and Ibanez collaborated to make a similar pedal, with both a regular flanger mode and a mode which can be set to create a close approximation of the A/DA pedal's sound, and the pedal has been released as the Ibanez Paul Gilbert AF-2 Airplane Flanger. He also uses the Psilocybe phaser and THC chorus pedals from [[Home Brew Electronics]].

In the intro to "Get Out Of My Yard" Gilbert uses a [[Boss Corporation|Boss]] DD-3 [[Delay (audio effect)|Delay]] [[Effects pedal|pedal]] to achieve the altered pitch looped effect at the beginning of the track. This was also demonstrated by Gilbert on the instructional DVD of the same name.

He is also famous for using a Makita cordless drill with three picks mounted on the end of it, which he used most famously on the Mr. Big track "Daddy, Brother, Lover, Little Boy".

In 2009, Ibanez released a new PGM model, the Ibanez PGM401, which is rather different from most of Gilbert's previous models, with an ash body (most of his previous models were made of basswood, although his PGM800 guitar was made of lightweight ash, a similar but different wood than that used in the PGM401), Trifade Burst finish, Cosmo Black hardware and a regular headstock replacing the reversed one of the previous models. Also, rather than the DiMarzio PAF Pro, Tone Zone and Super Distortion pickups used in his previous models, the PGM401 comes with Gilbert's favorite humbucker model for the past five years, the DiMarzio Air Classic, arranged in a dual humbucker arrangement. Gilbert has stated that he had the bridge pickup moved 1mm closer to the neck, which he said results in a warmer and thicker sound, particularly for the high notes he often uses in soloing. The F-holes are 3% smaller, to make the look more balanced with the pickup mounting rings. A noteworthy difference from other current Ibanez guitar models, is that the PGM401 uses the old late-1980s neckjoint, which is thicker than the current neckjoints on other Ibanez guitars.

In 2011, Ibanez released a new model for Gilbert the FRM100. The design of the FRM100 was inspired by many hours of playing and performance by Paul Gilbert with the original Ibanez Fireman model featuring a distinctive reverse Iceman body outline.

In 2014, Gilbert announced his new Ibanez signature model guitar, FRM250MF, at [[NAMM Show|NAMM]] 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Paul Gilbert: Announces New Ibanez Signature Model Guitar|url=http://metalshockfinland.com/2014/01/24/paul-gilbert-announces-new-ibanez-signature-model-guitar/|publisher=Metal Shock Finland|accessdate=25 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Ibanez Guitar|url=http://www.ibanez.co.jp/products/u_eg_sig_series14.php?series_id=11&amp;year=2014&amp;cat_id=1|publisher=Ibanez|accessdate=25 January 2014|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://archive.is/20140126105824/http://www.ibanez.co.jp/products/u_eg_sig_series14.php?series_id=11&amp;year=2014&amp;cat_id=1|archivedate=26 January 2014|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''petition mill''' is a [[fraud]] in which the perpetrator poses as a financial advisor, sometimes as a [[credit counseling|credit counselor]] or [[paralegal]], filing hastily prepared [[bankruptcy]] documents in the name of victims who come to the advisor as clients.  The bankruptcy filing is often both incomplete and inappropriate for the victim's condition; and, often, the victim does not even realize that a bankruptcy has been filed.

Victims are people in financial trouble who believe they are becoming clients of a professional operation.  The fraudster promises to make the [[foreclosure]]s, [[eviction]]s, [[repossession]]s, high interest rates on [[loan]]s, and other debt problems go away.  The victim pays a large initial fee for the fraudster's services, and the fraudster usually has the victim sign blank documents.  Sometimes the victim is also told to make their usual payments directly to the fraudulent advisor instead of the real creditors, or to transfer their real estate to the fraudster.  The payments are stolen by the fraudster instead of being used to pay victims' debts, and real estate is often [[deed]]ed in fractional shares to other victims unknowingly under bankruptcy, complicating ownership to make foreclosures even more difficult by having multiple (fraudulent) bankruptcies involved in the property.

In other petition mill schemes, the fraudster simply creates summary bankruptcy filings for the victim.  The victim is then told to file ''[[pro se]]'' in court and deny that anyone helped prepare the documents.

According to the ''[[United States Trustee]] Manual'', volume 5, chapter 5, the following are warning signs of a petition mill scheme:

# ''[[Pro se]]'' bankruptcy petition where the debtor says no one assisted him/her, but the debtor is clearly unfamiliar with the bankruptcy system
# ''Pro se'' petition filed despite the debtor denying filing bankruptcy
# Debtor failing to attend the section 341 meeting, where creditors and the [[United States Trustee]] first meet with the debtor
# "Face sheet" (suspiciously small) filing with a single creditor listed, usually the [[mortgagee]] or the [[landlord]]
# Debtor facing eviction, foreclosure, or repossession notice
# Pattern of ''pro se'' debtors with identical paperwork form, style, and general content
# Pattern of complaints from mortgagees or landlords
# Debtors or others being solicited by petition mills that stress stopping evictions, etc.
# Complaints by debtor that he/she has been making rent/mortgage/car payments to a third party (instead of to the original creditors)
# Advertising in budget papers and using flyers to advertise bankruptcy and divorce assistance at a low, fixed fee
# Implications that attorneys are supervising or approving the service
# Requests for payment of filing fee in installments
# Assets or liabilities not scheduled (filed in proper format)
# Failure to properly fill out or file schedules
# Use of [[Chapter 7, Title 11, United States Code|chapter 7]] (complete liquidation) when [[chapter 13]] (reorganization) is clearly feasible

'''Robert James Flynn''' (September 15, 1937 – May 15, 2014) was a [[Commander (United States)|Commander]] and [[Naval Flight Officer]] [[Bombardier (aircrew)|bombardier/]][[Navigator|navigator]] in the [[United States Navy]].  As a [[Lieutenant (United States)|Lieutenant]], he was captured by the Chinese in August 1967 after the [[Grumman A-6 Intruder|A-6 Intruder]] he was flying in on a mission over [[North Vietnam]] was shot down.  Flynn and his pilot, along with another A-6 Intruder crew, were evading North Vietnamese jets following their mission over [[Hanoi]] when they strayed over the border into Chinese air space.  Downed just over the Chinese border, Flynn was apprehended by the Chinese and held in [[China]] as a [[Prisoner of War]] where he was tortured and held almost exclusively in solitary confinement for five and a half years.

==Early life==
Flynn was born in [[La Crosse, Wisconsin]] and was raised in [[Houston, Minnesota]], he attended the [[University of Minnesota]].&lt;ref name=NYT&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2014/05/25/us/robert-j-flynn-shot-down-in-vietnam-war-dies-at-76.html|title=Robert J. Flynn, Shot Down in Vietnam War and Held in China, Dies at 76|publisher=New York Times|date=24 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==US Navy career==
On July 6, 1958, he joined the United States navy as a cadet.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title=For Military Merit - Recipients of the Purple Heart|last=Borch|first=Fred L.|publisher=Naval Institute Press|year=2010|isbn=978-1-59114-086-3|location=Annapolis, MD|pages=119 - 121}}&lt;/ref&gt; On June 20, 1960, he was designated as a [[Naval Flight Officer]]. He completed [[Douglas A-3 Skywarrior|A-3D]] training with [[VAH-123]] at [[NAS Whidbey Island]] from June 1960 to January 1961 he served as an A-3D navigator with [[VAH-8]] from January 1961 to June 1963. From June 1963 to March 1966 he served as an [[Grumman A-6 Intruder|A-6A Intruder]] instructor bombardier/navigator with [[Attack Squadron 85 (U.S. Navy)|VA-85]] at [[NAS Oceana]]. VA-85 deployed on {{USS|Kitty Hawk|CV-63|6}} from March to August 1966. He transferred to [[Attack Squadron 196 (U.S. Navy)|VA-196]] at NAS Whidbey Island in August 1966. In May 1967 VA-196 was deployed on the {{USS|Constellation|CV-64|6}} for deployment to Vietnam.

==Capture==
On 21 August 1967 four A-6A Intruders of VA-196 were launched from USS ''Constellation'' for an attack on the Duc Noi railyard in northern [[Hanoi]]. Lieutenant Commander Jimmy L. Buckley (pilot) and Lieutenant Flynn (bombardier/navigator) were the crew of A-6A [BuNo 152625/NK 400] which was hit by enemy fire on approach to the target area but continued with their attack. Over the target area the flight encountered heavy anti-aircraft fire and [[S-75 Dvina|SAMs]], A-6A [BuNo 152638/NK 410] was hit by enemy fire and both crewmen, Lieutenant Commander William M. Hardman and Captain Leo T. Profilet, ejected successfully but were captured. The remaining three A-6s left the target area in loose formation and were forced to head north to avoid bad weather, one of the aircraft sighted MiGs and two of the A-6s were tracked heading towards the Chinese border with two [[Shenyang J-6]] fighters in pursuit. A-6A [BuNo 152627/NK 402] was shot down north of the Chinese border and both crewmen, Lieutenant j.g Forrest Trembley&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.virtualwall.org/dt/TrembleyJF01a.htm |title=LCDR J Forrest George Trembley |work=The Virtual Wall |accessdate=2 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; (pilot) and Lieutenant j.g.

Later that day Chinese government radio confirmed that they had shot down two aircraft inside Chinese territory and that one crewman had been captured. Lieutenant Flynn believed that the Chinese fighters had attacked their flight over North Vietnamese territory, but US radar showed that the two A-6s were at least {{convert|11|mi}} inside Chinese territory when they were shot down.&lt;ref name=Morgan&gt;{{cite book|last=Morgan|first=Rick|title=A-6 Intruder Units of the Vietnam War|publisher=Osprey Publishing|year=2012|isbn=9781782003281|page=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Flynn was taken to [[Peking]] where he was held in solitary confinement for the next five and a half years.He was constantly tortured and was demanded to sign a confession that stated that he was a criminal who had violated Chinese airpsace. Flynn refused to cooperate.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

==Release==
Due to improving US-China relations following President [[Richard Nixon]]'s historic 1972 visit to China, Lieutenant Flynn was released on 15 March 1973, crossing the land border into [[British Hong Kong]].&lt;ref name=NYT/&gt;

'''''Robert and Elizabeth''''' is a [[musical theatre|musical]] with music by [[Ron Grainer]] and book and lyrics by [[Ronald Millar]].  The story is based on an unproduced musical titled ''The Third Kiss'' by Judge [[Fred G. Moritt]], which in turn was adapted from the play ''[[The Barretts of Wimpole Street]]'' by [[Rudolph Besier]].  It is an operetta-style musical which tells the story of the romance and elopement of poets [[Robert Browning]] and [[Elizabeth Barrett Browning|Elizabeth Barrett]]. The original 1964 London production was a success, starring Sir [[John Clements (actor)|John Clements]] as Barrett, [[June Bronhill]] as Elizabeth and [[Keith Michell]] as Robert.  Several revivals have followed.

The musical was produced at the Yvonne Arnaud Theatre in [[Guildford]], [[England]], starring [[Jeremy Brett]] and [[Sally Ann Howes]] from 22&amp;nbsp;December 1976 to 29 January 1977.  Another production ran at the [[Paper Mill Playhouse]], [[Millburn, New Jersey]], from November through December 1982, with [[Marc Jacoby]] as Robert and Leigh Beery as Elizabeth.&lt;ref&gt;Gussow, Mel.

The '''Royal Marriages Act 1772''' was an [[Act of Parliament|act]] of the [[Parliament of Great Britain]], which prescribed the conditions under which members of the [[British Royal Family]] could contract a valid [[marriage]], in order to guard against marriages that could diminish the status of the royal house. The right of [[veto]] vested in the sovereign by this act provoked severe adverse criticism at the time of its passage.&lt;ref&gt;C. Grant Robertson, ''Select statutes, cases and documents to illustrate English constitutional history''(4th edn. 1923) pages 245–7&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Lord Mackay of Clashfern, [[Lord High Chancellor]] of Great Britain, ed. ''Halsbury's Laws of England'' (4th edn. 1998), volume 21 (1), Page 21&lt;/ref&gt; It was repealed as a result of the 2011 [[Perth Agreement]], which came into force on 26 March 2015. Under the [[Succession to the Crown Act 2013]], the first six people in the line of succession (currently [[Charles, Prince of Wales|Prince Charles]], [[Prince William, Duke of Cambridge|Prince William]], [[Prince George of Cambridge|Prince George]], [[Princess Charlotte of Cambridge|Princess Charlotte]], [[Prince Louis of Cambridge|Prince Louis]] and [[Prince Harry]]) need permission to marry if they and their descendants are to remain in the line of succession.

==Provisions==
The Act said that no descendant of [[George II of Great Britain|King George II]], male or female, other than the issue of princesses who had married or might thereafter marry "into foreign families", could marry without the consent of the reigning [[Monarchy of the United Kingdom|monarch]], "signified under the great seal and declared in council". That consent was to be set out in the licence and in the register of the marriage, and entered in the books of the [[Privy Council of the United Kingdom|Privy Council]]. Any marriage contracted without the consent of the monarch was to be null and void.

However, any member of the Royal Family over the age of 25 who had been refused the sovereign's consent could marry one year after giving notice to the [[Privy Council of the United Kingdom|Privy Council]] of their intention so to marry, unless both houses of Parliament expressly declared their disapproval. There is, however, no instance in which the sovereign's formal consent in Council was refused.

The Act further made it a crime to perform or participate in an illegal marriage of any member of the Royal Family. This provision was repealed by the [[Criminal Law Act 1967]]&lt;ref&gt;Criminal Law Act 1967, Section 13 and Schedule 4.&lt;/ref&gt;.

==Rationale==

The Act was proposed by [[George III of the United Kingdom|George III]] as a direct result of the marriage of his brother, [[Prince Henry, Duke of Cumberland and Strathearn]], who in 1771 had married the commoner [[Anne, Duchess of Cumberland and Strathearn|Anne Horton]], the daughter of [[Simon Luttrell, 1st Earl of Carhampton|Simon Luttrell]] and the widow of Christopher Horton. Royal Assent was given to the Act on 1 April 1772,&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette|issue=11236|page=1|date=4 April 1772}}&lt;/ref&gt; and it was only on 13 September following that the King learned that another brother, [[Prince William Henry, Duke of Gloucester and Edinburgh]], had in 1766 secretly married [[Maria, Duchess of Gloucester and Edinburgh|Maria]], the illegitimate daughter of Sir [[Edward Walpole]] and the widow of the [[James Waldegrave, 2nd Earl Waldegrave|2nd Earl Waldegrave]].&lt;ref&gt;Matthew Kilburn, [http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/29456 William Henry, Prince, first duke of Gloucester and Edinburgh (1743–1805)], Oxford Dictionary of National Biography, Oxford University Press, 2004; online edn, Jan 2008. Retrieved 18 December 2011&lt;/ref&gt; Both alliances were considered highly unsuitable by the King, who "saw himself as having been forced to marry for purely dynastic reasons".&lt;ref name="bogdanor"&gt;{{cite book

==Couples affected==

* On 15 December 1785, the King's eldest son [[George IV of the United Kingdom|George, Prince of Wales]], married privately and in contravention of this Act the twice-widowed [[Maria Anne Fitzherbert]], a practising Roman Catholic, at her house in Park Lane, London, according to the rites of the Church of England. Although viewed as a canonically sound marriage by Roman Catholics,{{citation needed|date=November 2016}}{{dubious|date=November 2016}} this marriage was invalid under the Act. Had the marriage been valid, it would have excluded the Prince from succession to the throne under the terms of the [[Act of Settlement 1701]].
* On 29 September 1791, the King's second son [[Prince Frederick, Duke of York and Albany|Prince Frederick, Duke of York]], married [[Princess Frederica Charlotte of Prussia]], at [[Charlottenburg]], [[Berlin]], but the ceremony had to be repeated in London on 23 November 1791 as, although consent had been given at the [[Privy Council of the United Kingdom|Privy Council]] on 28 September, it had proved impossible to obtain the Great Seal in time and doubt had thus been thrown on the legality of the marriage.&lt;ref&gt;A. Aspinall, ed., ''The later correspondence of George III'', vol. 1 (1966) pages 567–71. The statement in Michel Huberty, Alain Giraud, F. and B. Magdelaine, ''L'Allemagne Dynastique'', vol. 3: Brunswick-Nassau-Schwarzbourg (1981) page 146, that the first marriage was by procuration (or proxy) is incorrect.&lt;/ref&gt;
* On 4 April 1793, [[Augustus, Duke of Sussex|Prince Augustus]], the sixth son of the King, married [[Lady Augusta Murray]], in contravention of the Act, first privately and without witnesses, according to the rites of the Church of England at the Hotel Sarmiento, Rome, and again, after [[banns]], on 5 December 1793, at [[St George's, Hanover Square]], London. Both marriages were declared null and void by the [[Court of Arches]] on 14 July 1794, and the two resulting children were subsequently considered illegitimate.&lt;ref&gt;This marriage, being invalid, was not morganatic as is frequently stated, e.g. by Michael Thornton, ''Royal Feud'' (1985) page 161.&lt;/ref&gt;
* After the death of Lady Augusta Murray, [[Augustus Frederick, Duke of Sussex|Prince Augustus]], now Duke of Sussex, apparently married (no contemporary evidence survives), again in contravention of the Act, about 2 May 1831, at her house in Great Cumberland Place, London, [[Lady Cecilia Underwood|Lady Cecilia Buggin]], who on that day had taken the surname Underwood in lieu of Buggin and who, on 10 April 1840, was created [[Duchess of Inverness]] by Queen Victoria (the Duke being Earl of Inverness). The Queen had thereby, as Lord Melbourne wrote, "recognized the moral and religious effect of whatever has taken place whilst she avoided the legal effects of a legal marriage which was what her Majesty was most anxious to do".&lt;ref&gt;[[Mollie Gillen]], ''Royal Duke'' (1976) page 223.&lt;/ref&gt; Acceptance of the marriage would have meant acceptance of the Duke's earlier marriage and the legitimacy of his two children. However, the couple cohabited and were socially accepted as husband and wife.
* On 8 January 1847, the Queen's first cousin [[Prince George, Duke of Cambridge|Prince George of Cambridge]] married, by licence of the [[Master of the Faculties|Faculty Office]] but in contravention of this Act, [[Sarah Fairbrother]], a pregnant actress with four illegitimate children (two by himself and two by other men), at [[St James Church, Clerkenwell|St James, Clerkenwell]]. From about 1858, Fairbrother took the name Mrs FitzGeorge. The marriage was non-existent, not a [[morganatic marriage]] as many have called it.&lt;ref&gt;e.g. Compton Mackenzie, ''The Windsor tapestry'' (1938) page 344; Michael Thornton, ''Royal Feud'' (1985) pages 161–2, and many other authorities.&lt;/ref&gt; It is also incorrect to say that Queen Victoria refused to consent to this marriage, as no application was made to her under the Act,&lt;ref&gt;As stated in Brian Inglis, ''Abdication'' (1966) page 265, and many other authorities.&lt;/ref&gt; it being very apparent that no consent would be given.
* After [[Charles Edward, Duke of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha|Charles Edward, Duke of Albany]] was deprived of his British titles under the [[Titles Deprivation Act 1917]] due to his German loyalties during World War I, his descendants married without consent from the British monarch (the earliest in 1932{{fact|date=November 2018}}). As Charles Edward was a male-line grandson of Queen Victoria, application of the Royal Marriages Act as written renders null and void for the purposes of British law the marriages of his children, despite having been lawfully contracted in Germany.{{efn|1=According to a Home Office memorandum on the matter, "All the descendants of a British prince require the consent, even if he has become a foreign Sovereign and his family have lived abroad for generations. Thus the Hanoverian Royal Family, who are descended from George III's son, the Duke of Cumberland, who succeeded to the throne of Hanover on the accession of Queen Victoria, have regularly obtained the King's consent to their marriages: in 1937 Princess Frederica of Hanover, great-great granddaughter of George III and 3rd cousin once removed of the King, asked his consent to her wedding with the Crown Prince of Greece. It seems absurd that the King's consent should be obtained for a purely foreign marriage of this kind; one can only suppose that as the marriage would not be valid in the British Dominions without it, the object is to secure the position of the issue as Princes or Princesses of Great Britain (which rank is much valued on the Continent) and possibly to retain their place in the line of succession to the British Throne. Obviously the absence of the Royal Consent required by British law could not affect the validity of a marriage contracted abroad so far as the law of the country of domicile of the parties is concerned. It should be noted here that the Act applies to all marriages in which one of the parties is a descendant of George II, whether contracted in Great Britain or abroad. See as to this the decision of the House of Lords, given after taking the opinion of the Judges, in the Sussex Peerage case (xi Clark and Finelly, 85 ff.)"&lt;ref name=aje01/&gt;}}
* The only known case in which permission to marry was withheld by the British sovereign despite a formal request under the Royal Marriages Act is that of [[Prince George William of Hanover (1915–2006)|Prince George William of Hanover]], a German citizen descended from King George III, whose father and grandfather were deprived of their British titles under the [[Titles Deprivation Act 1917]] due to their German loyalties during World War I. On 23 April 1946, George William married [[Princess Sophie of Greece and Denmark]], who was about to become a kinswoman to the British royal family as her brother [[Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh|Prince Philip]] was courting the future [[Elizabeth II|Queen Elizabeth II]]. Their request for permission from King George VI received no response due to sensitivity over the fact that a state of war still existed between the United Kingdom and Germany,{{efn|1=After consultations with the [[Foreign Office]], [[Home Office]] and King George VI's private secretary, [[Alan Lascelles|Sir Alan Lascelles]], a ciphered telegram dated 18 April 1946 and crafted by [[Albert Napier|Sir Albert Napier]], permanent secretary to the [[Lord Chancellor]], was transmitted from the British [[Foreign Office]] to the Foreign Adviser to the British Commander in Chief at Berlin: "The Duke of Brunswick has formally applied to The King by letter of March 22nd for the consent of His Majesty under the Act 12 Geo. III, cap. 11 to the marriage of his son Prince George William with Princess Sophia Dowager Princess of Hesse. The marriage is understood to be taking place on April 23rd. Please convey to the Duke an informal intimation that in view of the fact that a state of war still exists between Great Britain and Germany, His Majesty is advised that the case is not one in which it is practicable for His consent to be given in the manner contemplated by the Act."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.heraldica.org/topics/britain/TNA/LCO_2_3371A.htm Marriage of Prince George William, son of the Duke of Brunswick, with Princess Sophia, Dowager Princess of Hesse. Request for The King's consent.] [[The National Archives (UK)]] [[Lord Chancellor's Department|LCO]] 2/3371A.&lt;/ref&gt;}} and it was held by British officials at the time that the marriage and its issue would not be legitimate in the United Kingdom despite being legal in Germany.&lt;ref name=aje01&gt;Eagleston, Arthur J. [http://www.heraldica.org/topics/britain/TNA/HO_45_25238.htm The Home Office and the Crown]. pp. 9–14. [[The National Archives (UK)]]|TNA, [[Home Office|HO]] 45/25238, Royal Marriages.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Broad effects==
The Act rendered void any marriage wherever contracted or solemnised in contravention of it. A member of the royal family who contracted a marriage that violated the Act did ''not'' thereby lose his or her place in the line of succession,&lt;ref name="bogdanor"/&gt; but the offspring of such a union were made [[illegitimate]] by the voiding of the marriage and thus lost any right to succeed.

The Act applied to [[Roman Catholic|Catholics]], even though they are ineligible to succeed to the throne.&lt;ref name="bogdanor"/&gt; It did not apply to descendants of [[Sophia of Hanover]] who are not also descendants of George II, even though they are still eligible to succeed to the throne.

It had been claimed that the marriage of [[Augustus, Duke of Sussex|Prince Augustus]] had been legal in Ireland and Hanover, but the Committee of Privileges of the House of Lords ruled (in the [[Duke of Sussex|Sussex Peerage]] Case, 9 July 1844) that the Act incapacitated the descendants of George II from contracting a legal marriage without the consent of the Crown, either within the British dominions or elsewhere.

The effects of the law were not always foreseen. An example is seen in the royal House of Hanover, which descends from [[Ernest Augustus, King of Hanover|Ernest Augustus, Duke of Cumberland]], a younger son of King [[George III of the United Kingdom|George III]], who inherited the crown of Hanover according to its [[Salic law|semi-Salic]] [[order of succession]] when the British crown went to his niece, [[Queen Victoria]]. Although his descendants lost their royal crown in 1866, and their British titles in 1919, as male-line descendants of George II they continued to seek permission for their marriages from the British monarch. Thus, on 11 January 1999, [[Elizabeth II]] issued the following [[Order in Council|Declaration in Council]]: "My Lords, I do hereby declare My Consent to a Contract of Matrimony between His Royal Highness Prince [[Prince Ernst August of Hanover (born 1954)|Ernst August Albert of Hanover]], Duke of [[Brunswick-Lüneburg]] and Her Serene Highness [[Caroline, Princess of Hanover|Princess Caroline Louise Marguerite of Monaco]]...". Without this consent, the marriage would have been void in Britain, where the groom's family continues to own substantial property and retains the [[right to petition]] for resumption of the [[Duke of Cumberland and Teviotdale|dukedom of Cumberland and Teviotdale]], suspended since [[World War I]]. (However, as Ernst August married a Roman Catholic, he lost his place in the succession to the British throne under a different piece of legislation, the [[Act of Settlement 1701]].)

All European [[monarchy|monarchies]], and many non-European [[realm]]s, have laws or traditions requiring prior approval of the monarch for members of the reigning [[dynasty]] to marry. But Britain's was unusual because it was never modified between its original enactment and its repeal 243 years later, so that its [[wikt:ambit|ambit]] grew rather wide, affecting not only Britain's immediate Royal Family, but more distant relatives of the monarch.

==Farran exemption==
In the 1950s, Charles d'Olivier Farran, Lecturer in Constitutional Law at Liverpool University, theorised that the Act could no longer apply to anyone living, because all the members of the immediate royal family were descended from British princesses who had married into foreign families. The loophole is due to the Act's wording, whereby if a person is, through one line, a descendant of George II subject to the Act's restriction, but is ''also'', separately through another line, a descendant of a British princess married into a foreign family, the exemption for the latter reads as if it trumps the former.&lt;ref&gt;''Modern Law Review'', volume 14 (1951) pages 53–63;&lt;/ref&gt;

Many of George II's descendants in female lines have married back into the British royal family. In particular, the Queen and other members of the [[House of Windsor]] descend (through [[Queen Alexandra]]) from two daughters of George II — ([[Princess Mary of Great Britain|Mary, Landgravine of Hesse]] and [[Louise of Great Britain|Louise, Queen of Denmark]]) — who married foreign rulers (respectively [[Frederick II, Landgrave of Hesse-Kassel]], and King [[Frederick V of Denmark]]), and through [[Mary of Teck|Queen Mary]] from a third ([[Anne, Princess Royal and Princess of Orange|Anne, Princess of Orange]], consort of [[William IV, Prince of Orange]]). Queen Mary herself was a product of such a marriage; her parents were [[Princess Mary Adelaide of Cambridge]], a granddaughter of [[George III]] and [[Francis, Duke of Teck]], a minor German prince of the [[House of Württemberg]]. Moreover, [[Charles, Prince of Wales|The Prince of Wales]], his issue, siblings, and their issue descend from yet another such marriage, that of [[Princess Alice of the United Kingdom|The Princess Alice]], a daughter of [[Queen Victoria]], to [[Louis IV, Grand Duke of Hesse]], through their great-grandson [[Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh]].

This so-called "Farran exemption" met with wide publicity, but arguments against it were put forward by Clive Parry, Fellow of Downing College, Cambridge,&lt;ref&gt;in 'Further Considerations on the Prince of Hanover's Case' in ''International &amp; Comparative Law Quarterly (1957) pages 61 etc.&lt;/ref&gt; and Farran's interpretation has since been ignored.&lt;ref&gt;Farran replied to Mr Parry in Appendix I, 'The Royal Marriages Act Today', in Lucille Iremonger, ''Love and the Princesses' (1958) pages 275–280.&lt;/ref&gt; Consent to marriages in the Royal Family (including the distantly related [[House of Hanover]]) continued to be sought and granted as if none of the agnatic descendants of George II were also his cognatic descendants.

Parry argued that the "Farran exemption" theory was complicated by the fact that all the [[Protestant]] descendants of the [[Electress Sophia of Hanover]], ancestress of the United Kingdom's monarchs since 1714, had been entitled to British citizenship under the [[Sophia Naturalization Act 1705]] (if born prior to 1949, when the act was repealed). Thus, some marriages of British princesses to [[Continental Europe|continental]] monarchs and princes were not, in law, marriages to foreigners. For example, the 1947 marriage of Princess Elizabeth to [[Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh]], by birth a Greek and Danish prince but descended from the Electress Sophia, was a marriage to a British subject even if he had not been previously [[naturalisation|naturalised]] in Britain. This would also mean theoretically, for example, that the present royal family of Norway is bound by the Act, for the marriage of [[Maud of Wales|The Princess Maud]], a daughter of King [[Edward VII of the United Kingdom|Edward VII]], to the future King [[Haakon VII of Norway]], was a marriage to a "British subject", since Haakon descended from the Electress Sophia.

==Exemption of the former Edward VIII==

In 1936 the statute [[His Majesty's Declaration of Abdication Act 1936]] specifically excluded [[Edward VIII of the United Kingdom|Edward VIII]] from the provisions of this Act upon his abdication, allowing him to marry the divorcee, [[Wallis, Duchess of Windsor|Wallis Simpson]]. The wording of the statute also excluded any issue of the marriage both from being subject to the Act, and from the succession to the throne; no marriages or succession rights were ultimately affected by this language, as the Duke and Duchess of Windsor had no children.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.statutelaw.gov.uk/content.aspx?activeTextDocId=1083735 His Majesty's Declaration of Abdication Act 1936 (c.3)], full text online at statutelaw.gov.uk&lt;/ref&gt;

==Perth Agreement==
{{main|Perth Agreement}}
In October 2011 [[David Cameron]] wrote to the leaders of the other [[Commonwealth realm]]s proposing that the act be limited to the first six people in line to the throne.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-15282940|title=David Cameron proposes changes to royal succession|date=12 October 2011|work=BBC News|accessdate=12 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The leaders approved the proposed change at the [[Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting 2011|Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting]] held in [[Perth]], Western Australia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-15492607|title=Girls equal in British throne succession|date=28 October 2011|work=BBC News|accessdate=28 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The legislation in a number of Commonwealth realms repeals the Royal Marriages Act 1772 in its entirety. It was, in the United Kingdom, replaced by the [[Succession to the Crown Act 2013]], which stipulates a requirement for the first six people in the [[line of succession]] to obtain the sovereign's consent before marrying in order to remain eligible. Article 3(5) of the new act also provides that, except for succession purposes, any marriage that would have been void under the original act "is to be treated as never having been void" if it did not involve any of the first six people in the line of succession at the time of the marriage; royal consent was never sought or denied; "in all the circumstances it was reasonable for the person concerned not to have been aware at the time of the marriage that the Act applied to it"; and no one has acted on the basis that the marriage is void. New Zealand's [[Royal Succession Act 2013]] repealed the Royal Marriages Act and provided for royal consent for the first six people in the [[line of succession]] to be granted by the monarch in right of the United Kingdom.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite act |title=[[Royal Succession Act 2013]] |year=2013 |article-type=Section |article=8 |website=New Zealand Legislation |url=http://www.legislation.govt.nz/act/public/2013/0149/latest/DLM5025819.html |access-date=10 August 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Other legislation==
The [[Regency Acts#Regency Act 1830|Regency Act 1830]], which provided for a regency in the event that [[Queen Victoria]] inherited the throne before she was eighteen, made it illegal for her to marry without the regent's consent. Her spouse and anyone involved in arranging or conducting the marriage without such consent would be guilty of [[high treason]]. This was more serious than the offence created by the Act of 1772, which was equivalent to [[praemunire]]. However, the Act never came into force, as Victoria was eighteen when she became queen.

==Consents for marriages under the Act==
Consents under the Act were entered in the Books of the Privy Council but have not been published. In 1857 it became customary to publish them in the ''London Gazette'' and notices appear of consents given in Council at Courts held on the following dates. Not all consents, however, were noted there and gaps in the list have been filled by reference to the Warrants for Royal Marriages in the Home Office papers (series HO 124) in The National Archives:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nationalarchives.gov.uk/catalogue |title=Discovery |publisher=The National Archives |date= |accessdate=2016-06-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''SaferNet''' is a [[Brazil]]ian [[non-governmental organization]] that combats [[Internet crime]] in partnership with the [[Federal Public Ministry]]. It facilitates anonymous reporting and provides information and training about Internet safety and security.

Safernet facilitates anonymous reporting of crimes, with extra consideration for preventing and investigating [[child pornography]], [[identity theft]] and various [[hate crime]]s. It also works with the government to improve legislation for Internet-related crimes. Safernet also educates, trains, and mobilizes the public on issues relating to their rights and safety.

In 2006, Safernet and the Federal Public Ministry brought a suit against [[Google]]'s Brazilian business unit alleging that Google was not policing [[Orkut]] pages enough to prevent pornography and hate crimes. Complying with the judge's ruling, Google provided the requested user information to the Brazilian authorities.[http://www.businessweek.com/technology/content/sep2006/tc20060901_939567.htm]

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3769">'''Société Nationale des Beaux-Arts''' ('''SNBA''') was the term under which two groups of French artists united, the first for some exhibitions in the early 1860s, the second since 1890 for annual exhibitions.

==1862==
Established in 1862, the ''Société Nationale des Beaux-Arts'' was first chaired by the writer [[Théophile Gautier]], with the painter [[Aimé Millet]] as deputy chairman. The committee was composed with the painters [[Eugène Delacroix]], [[Albert-Ernest Carrier-Belleuse|Carrier-Belleuse]], [[Puvis de Chavannes]] and among the exhibitors were [[Léon Bonnat]], [[Jean-Baptiste Carpeaux]], [[Charles-François Daubigny]], [[Gustave Doré]], [[Manet]]. In 1864, just after the death of Delacroix, the society organized a retrospective exhibition of 248 paintings and lithographs of this famous painter and step-uncle of the emperor - and ceased to mount further exhibitions.

The 19th century in French art is characterised by a continuous struggle between traditionally educated artists supported by official politics, and a growing rate of artists who preferred to work individually and at their own riscs. Reviewing the historical situation is difficult, even a century later. But evidently opponents to the official politics gained ground after the fall of the 2nd Empire, and were instrumental to redirect French cultural politics to liberal positions. Thus, the splitting-off of the ''Société Nationale des Beaux-Arts'' in 1890 can be considered as the first ''[[Secessionism|Secessionist]]'' manifestation, at all.

==1890==
In 1890, the ''Société Nationale des Beaux-Arts'' was re-vitalised under the rule of [[Puvis de Chavannes]], [[Jean-Louis-Ernest Meissonier|Ernest Meissonier]], [[Carolus-Duran]], [[Bracquemond]] and [[Albert-Ernest Carrier-Belleuse|Carrier-Belleuse]], and since then its annual exhibition was reviewed as the ''Salon de Champ-de-Mars'', traditionally opening a fortnight later than the official ''Salon de Champs-Élysées'', organised by the [[Société des artistes français]].

[[Suzanne Valadon]] became the first female painter to be admitted to the Société in 1894.

===A new way===
After World War I, in 1926, the "Puvis de Chavannes" prize was created consisting in a retrospective exhibition of the main works of the prizewinning artists, in Paris. During the twentieth century, this exhibition was located at the [[Grand Palais]] or the Musée d'Art Moderne.

Most famous awarded painters: 1941: Wilhem Van Hasselt, 1944: Jean Gabriel Domergue, 1952: [[Tristan Klingsor]], 1955: Georges Delplanque, 1957: Albert Decaris, 1958: Jean Picard Le Doux, 1963: [[Maurice Boitel]], 1966: Pierre Gaillardot, 1968: Pierre-Henry, 1969:Louis Vuillermoz, 1970: [[Daniel du Janerand]], 1971: Jean-Pierre Alaux; 1975: Jean Monneret, 1987: André Hambourg.&lt;ref&gt;Société Nationale des Beaux Arts, Biennale 1991, Grand Palais, année du centenaire, catalogue pages 8 and 9&lt;/ref&gt;

During the last decades of the 20th century, after "[[living treasure]]" [[Takanori Oguiss]], and during the rule of chairman François Baboulet, some of Japanese artists could exhibit their paintings as guests of the SNBA: [[Takaaki Matsuda]], [[Katsufumi Toyota]], [[Kazuko Kobayashi]], [[Hideo Hando]], [[Yoko Tsuishi]] and [[Noboru Sotoyama]].&lt;ref&gt;Société Nationale des Beaux Arts, Biennale 1991, Grand Palais, année du centenaire, catalogue pages 8 and 9&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="20762">The [[Herwald Ramsbotham, 1st Viscount Soulbury|Soulbury]] Commission ([[Sinhala language|Sinhala]]: සෝල්බරි කොමිෂන් සභාව ''Solbari Komishan Sabhawa''), announced in 1944 was, like its predecessor, the [[Donoughmore Commission]], a prime instrument of constitutional reform in [[British Ceylon]]. The immediate basis for the appointment of a commission for constitutional reforms was the 1944 draft constitution  of the Board of Ministers, headed by [[D.S Senanayake]]. This commission ushered in [[Dominion]] status and Independence to Sri Lanka in 1948. Its constitutional recommendations were largely those of the 1944 Board of Ministers' draft, a document reflecting the influence of Senanayake and his main advisor, Sir [[Ivor Jennings]] &lt;ref name="kms"&gt;Prof. K. M. de Silva, History of Sri Lanka, Penguin 1995&lt;/ref&gt; Chapter 33).

==Background to the appointment of the commission==
The struggle for Independence in [[Sri Lanka|Ceylon]] had been fought on "constitutionalist" lines rather than on the strongly confrontational approach that had developed in British India. Only the Marxists, a tiny minority, had attempted to create confrontational conditions which they believed to be a harbinger of the impending [[proletarian revolution]] against Imperialism. D. S. Senanayake was the leader of the "constitutionalist" wing of the Sri Lankan independence movement. He began to develop a "Ceylonese" vision for Sri Lanka, i.e., co-operation of all the ethnic and religious groups. To this end he masterminded the appointment of [[Arunachalam Mahadeva]], a respected Tamil politician as the minister of Home affaires(,&lt;ref name="kms" /&gt; p560). Senanayake began to formulate a draft constitution following the conditions laid down by the Colonial Secretary of State in 1943. There were three aspects to the effort. The first was the abandonment of the [[Donoughmore Constitution]] and the formulation of a [[Westminster Model]]. The second was that the Governor's reserve powers and other controls of the Imperial government would be abandoned and there would be full responsibility in internal civil matters. However, the crown's reserve powers would be retained especially in regard to limitations set upon the [[Sri Lanka|Ceylonese]] legislature regarding religious and ethnic minorities. The Crown would also retain defence and external affairs. The third was the ratification of the new constitution by a 3/4 majority in the State Council of Ceylon.

==The Draft Constitution of the Board of Ministers==
Senanayake and his advisors worked with remarkable speed by 1944, and a draft was made ready for submission to [[Whitehall]]. Many groups who opposed the move towards independence, notably British business groups, certain church dignitaries criticized the rapid moves in what they termed "lack of consultation". The 1943 Colonial Secretary's discussions envisaged that the draft constitution would be examined by a "suitable commission or conference", after the victory over the Axis powers. However, Senanayake pressed for an immediate consideration of their proposals. There was great reluctance and no sense of urgency on the part of the Colonial office. However, Senanayake, [[Oliver Goonetilleke]] and others had developed impressive contacts with Lord [[Mountbatten]] who, as Supreme Allied Commander of South-East Asia had worked from [[Colombo]]. A telegram from Lord Mountbatten &lt;ref&gt;Mountbatten's Telegram No: SAC 2626, 22 May 1944, marked "Top Secret" to the war cabinet.&lt;/ref&gt; is believed have been crucial in over-riding the foot-dragging of the Colonial office and conceding to Senanayake's demands. The appointment of a commission was made on July 5, 1944.

==Reaction to the Commission==
Although the appointment of a commission without waiting for the end of the War was a great concession, the announcement of the Commission headed by [[Herwald Ramsbotham, 1st Viscount Soulbury|Lord Soulbury]] was greeted with dismay by Senanayake and others. Their disappointment was due to the widening of the scope of the commission beyond what was set out by the Colonial Secretary in 1943, to also consult with "various interests, including the minority communities concerned with the subject of constitutional reforms in Ceylon". Senanayake was a man who preferred behind-the-curtain negotiations instead of confrontational public hearings. He felt that such consultations would simply become very divisive. In fact, the politics of the 1930s had become very communal or racist, with the first Sinhala-Tamil riot occurring in 1939, after an inflammatory speech by [[G. G. Ponnambalam]], a leading Tamil politician.&lt;ref name="jane"&gt;Dr. Jane. Russell, Communal Politics under the Donoughmore Constitution, 1931-1947, Tissara Publishers, Colombo 1982&lt;/ref&gt; Senanayake and the Board of Ministers resorted to an official boycott of the commission as an expression of their disapproval of the widening of the scope of the commission. However, this merely meant that they did not appear before the commission in public or "official" sittings. Senanayake and his associates held private meetings where the commissioners were the guests of honour. In fact, [[Oliver Goonetilleke]] became an "unofficial secretary" to the commission and significantly influenced it. This enabled Senanayake and his advisors to present their views without getting into confrontational politics with the [[Tamil Congress]], led by G. G. Ponnambalam who was allowed to dominate many of the official hearings.

===G. G. Ponnambalam's submissions===
Tamil politics during the time of the Donoughmore Commission was dominated by [[casteism]], with [[P. Ramanathan]] as its chief exponent. Tamils, only about 15% {{Citation needed|date=March 2009}} of the population, had a strong, dominant position in the early legislatures of the country. The introduction of [[Universal Franchise]] in 1931 completely changed the character of [[Sri Lanka|Ceylonese]] politics, where Tamil politicians found it very difficult to accept that they would become a minority. The eminent [[Peradeniya]] historian, Prof. K. M.de Silva attributes this to the collapse of the [[Ceylon National Congress]]. According to Dr. Jane Russell, Tamils also found it very irksome that the Sinhalese possessed a written history known as the [[Mahavamsa]] extending back to some 25 centuries {{Citation needed|date=March 2009}}, whereas the Tamils were seen as later migrants or invading settlers. This, as well as other factors led to a development of Tamil nationalism and communal feeling, displacing casteism to a secondary place in the nation's politics. Communal politics, which involved attacks on the [[Mahavamsa]], suspicious examination of appointments to public office, opening of colonisation schemes etc., for communal bias became common place. G. G. Ponnambalam wrested control of Tamil politics from the Arunachalam-family  elitist Colombo Tamil group and followed a stridently communal political program. This was matched by similar nationalist politics, led by [[S. W. R. D. Bandaranaike]], the Sinhalese counterpart of Ponnambalam.

====Balance representation scheme====
The Tamil Congress, led by Ponnambalam, had evolved the policy of 50-50, i.e., allocation of an equal number of seats in the legislature to the Tamils and the Sinhalese, over-riding the natural Universal Franchise representation where the 15% Tamils, 75% Sinhalese {{Citation needed|date=March 2009}}, would lead to only about 15 seats in a chamber with 100 representatives,(&lt;ref name="jane" /&gt; p308). Ponnambalam, an English-educated Catholic lawyer who was elitist and abrasive by temperament justified this by pointing out that there were roughly equal numbers of English educated (i.e., upper caste) Sinhalese and Tamils, and that this would also guarantee a place of political parity for the Tamils.  Thus Ponnambalam proposed that the legislature should be: "based on the balanced scheme of representation that would avoid the danger of concentration of power in one community, but would ensure its equitable distribution among all communities and the people as a whole"(,&lt;ref name="soulbury"&gt;Soulbury Report, London, 1945&lt;/ref&gt; p.&amp;nbsp;92). Ponnambalam also proposed further constitutional mechanisms to "safeguard minority rights".

Ponnambalam's very artificial and unusual schemes for securing the continued parity of status of Tamils, completely contrary to the "one man-one vote" concept thoroughly accepted in European liberalism, met with severe disapprobation by the commissioners. They stated that "any attempt by artificial means to convert a majority into a minority is not only inequitable, but doomed to failure".&lt;ref name="soulbury" /&gt; Ponnambalam's proposals were considered to be a means of conferring a minority supremacy amounting to virtual majority rule, and "denial of the democratic principle"(&lt;ref name="jane" /&gt;  p.&amp;nbsp;311). The ''Hindu organ'', an influential newspaper of the time, condemned it as something that "can only be maintained against the united opposition of the Sinhalese by British bayonets".

====Claims of Discrimination====
The submissions in front of the Soulbury commission also included specific grievances of the Ceylon Tamils regarding claimed unfair discrimination against their community. These included claims of discrimination in appointments to the Public Service,  claims of settlement policies in newly opened colonisation schemes which favour the Sinhalese, the Buddhist Temporalities act of 1931, the [[Anuradhapura]] Preservation Ordinance of 1931, the question of ports in the Northern peninsula, a claimed discriminatory bias in education, medical services etc., favouring the Sinhalese.

However, the commission concluded that "the evidence submitted to us provides no substantial indication of a general policy on the part of the Government of Ceylon of discrimination against minority communities".

The extensive and lengthy orations of Ponnambalam were rewarded by the commissioners by introducing a provision for multi-member constituencies in suitable areas, allowing for greater representation for ethnic minorities like Tamils, Muslims and other groups. The commissioners also recommended inclusion of provisions relating to communal discrimination. The first was that "the Parliament of Ceylon shall not make any law rendering persons of any community or religion liable to disabilities or restrictions to which persons of other communities are not made liable,&amp;nbsp;...". Another provision was that any bill which evoked "serious opposition by any racial or religious community and which, in the opinion of the Governor-General is likely to involve oppression or serious injustice to any community must be reserved by the Governor-General"(&lt;ref name="soulbury" /&gt; p.&amp;nbsp;101).

===Kandyan Proposals===
The low-country Sinhalese and the Kandyans had largely co-operated in their politics during the 1930s. [[S. W. R. D. Bandaranaike|Bandaranaike]]'s marriage to the Ratwatte family, influential in Kandyan circles, had also helped to bridge the gap between the two groups. However, the presence of a commission gave the Kandyan groups a chance to claim some powers for themselves, just as the Tamil Congress was largely arguing to secure Tamil interests.  The Kandyans proposed a Federal scheme where the Up-country region, the Low-country, and the North would be three federal states. Their suggestions were rejected by the commissioners who found no merit in the federal proposals.

==Acceptance of the Soulbury Constitution==
The British historian Jane Russell argues that the official boycott of the Soulbury Commission by the Board of Ministers led by Senanayake was a "statesman-like action, if not a diplomatic coup. The fact that the more&amp;nbsp;... communal-minded (politicians) held aloof&amp;nbsp;... , enabled the minorities to have the floor unchallenged. This manoeuvre avoided a repetition of the situation&amp;nbsp;... of the Donoughmore Commission where there had been a spiraling of communal demands as accusations and denunciations (which) provoked counter-accusations,&amp;nbsp;... until communal tension reached&amp;nbsp;... in outbreaks of violence. (sic) It enabled G. G. Ponnambalam to strut about the political arena for a few months unimpeded", while the Board of Ministers maintained a quiet dignity while doing behind-the-curtain politics. Thus the visit of the Soulbury Commission and the final Soulbury Report did much to reconcile the minority communities with the Sinhalese leadership under D. S. Senanayake. The voting in the third reading (in March) of the "Free Lanka" bill of January 1945, was supported by all the Muslim members, and by T. G. Rajakulendran, S. P. Vytilingam,  and V. Nalliah. Some of the other minority members who did not want to openly support the bill took care to be absent or abstain. Finally, the debate and the vote of acceptance on the eighth and ninth of September 1945 was the most significant indication of general reconciliation among the ethnic and regional groups. Far exceeding the 3/4 majority required by the Soulbury Commission, Senanayake had 51 votes in favour and only three votes against the adoption of the constitution. The vote was "in many ways a vote of confidence by all communities in&amp;nbsp;... Senanayake", and the minorities were as anxious as the majority for self-government(&lt;ref name="jane" /&gt; p 317, also,&lt;ref&gt;Ivor Jennings, The Constitution of Ceylon, Oxford University Press, 1949&lt;/ref&gt; p.&amp;nbsp;6).

Senanayake's speech in proposing the motion of acceptance made reference to the minorities and said "throughout this period the Ministers had in view one objective only, the attainment of maximum freedom. Accusations of Sinhalese domination have been bandied about. We can afford to ignore them for it must be plain to every one that what we sought was not Sinhalese domination, but Ceylonese domination. We devised a scheme that gave heavy weight to the minorities; we deliberately protected them against discriminatory legislation. We vested important powers in the Governor-General&amp;nbsp;... We decided upon an Independent Public Service Commission so as to give assurance that there should be no communalism in the Public Srvice.(sic) I do not normally speak as a Sinhalese, and I do not think that the Leader of this Council ought to think of himself as a Sinhalese representative, but for once I should like to speak as a Sinhalese and assert with all the force at my command that the interests of one community are the interests of all. We are one of another, what ever race or creed."&lt;ref&gt;Hansard, State Council of Ceylon 1945&lt;/ref&gt;

When the war ended, D. S. Senanayake was ready, on a mission to Whitehall to push for full dominion status instead of the status discussed in the 1943 Colonial secretary's report. During August–September 1945 Senanayake argued that the limits on Ceylon's external sovereignty (defence and external affairs), adhered to by the Soulbury report were unworkable and unnecessary. Senanayake suggested the confirmation of Dominion status by an Order in Council, and delivered a draft to G. H. Hall, the new Secretary to the Colonies. While the new labour government was prepared to accept the Soulbury report, it was firmly opposed to granting Dominion Status. The British were willing to consider Dominion status six years after the Soulbury constitution, say in 1953-54, although this was not revealed to the Ceylonese politicians. In 1947, with the general election to the new parliament scheduled for August–September 1947, Senanayake once again pressed Whitehall for a more precise date for Dominion Status. Arthur Creeh-Jones, successor to Hall in the Colonial office was much more receptive to Senanayake's request. Independence for India was announced by the Labour cabinet on 20 February 1947. Oliver Goonatilleke, who was handling the negotiations in Whitehall on behalf of Senanayake, argued that the immediate granting of Dominion Status was urgently necessary since the moderates were under increasing pressure from left-wing and nationalist extremist groups. The British government made the official announcement on 18 June 1947 that the Island would receive "fully responsible status within the British Commonwealth of Nations".

G. G. Ponnambalam had in the 1930s begun to declare that he is a "proud Dravidian"&lt;ref&gt;Hansard 1935&lt;/ref&gt; and had rejected the "Ceylonese Concept" of Senanayake and others at the time. At the end of the Soulbury submissions, he decided to moderate his politics, and publicly advocated "responsive cooperation" with the Sinhalese leaders. He joined the cabinet of D. S. Senanayake who became the first prime minister of independent Ceylon in 1948. [[S. W. R. D. Bandaranaike]], the Sinhalese Nationalist counterpart of Ponnambalam had also joined the cabinet, leaving the opposition to the Marxists and small nationalist groups.

==The aftermath==
An important piece of legislation, enacted in 1948, and modified in 1949, was the Indian Citizenship act, which limited citizenship to [[Hill-country Tamils|Indian workers]] who had at least 10 years of residence in the country &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sandaruwan.tripod.com/mythology.htm|title=S. M. Bandara, Details of the citizenship act.|publisher=|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20010531123753/http://sandaruwan.tripod.com/mythology.htm|archivedate=2001-05-31|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; This was similar to the requirement which was then current in most European countries. Although Senanayake had consistently supported their citizenship under less strict conditions as early as 1923, and as late as 1941 in the Indo-Ceylon talks,&lt;ref&gt;See Senator Natesan's speech, Hansard 1948&lt;/ref&gt; this change of attitude was a reaction to the increasing agitation of the Marxist trade-unionists whose power was misjudged by the colonial administration as well as most politicians of that era. Thus Senanayake was supported by many Tamil leaders including Ponnambalam, and constitutionalists like Dr. Ivor Jennings, in regard to the Indian citizenship act. The Soulbury commission had also recommended a "status quo" with regard to Indian workers. However, this was criticized by Senator Natesan, S. J. V. Chelvanayagam and followers who represented the emerging Tamil-nationalist fringe.

Although Ponnambalam moderated his politics and moved to the center, there was thus no shortage of ultra-nationalists or militant groups who attacked Senanayake's synthesis of all moderate groups within his United National Party of Ceylon. Because the "constitutionalist" approach of Senanayake and others led to independence without the fire and violence of the Indian program, many contended that the "independence" was illusory. Fears were expressed, mainly by the Marxists, of secret clauses and a hidden treaty. Events were to prove that these claims were false(,&lt;ref name="kms" /&gt; p.&amp;nbsp;569).

An ultra-nationalist Tamil movement which had previously grouped as the league of Tamil Federations denounced Ponnambalam and other Tamils as "traitors" and formed the [[Federal Party (Sri Lanka)|Ilankai Thamil Arasu Kachchi]](ITAK), or the Tamil Government Party. This party would present a deeply separatist agenda in its Tamil-language publications {{Citation needed|date=March 2009}}, but presented a more moderate picture in its English language presentations, where it was known as the Federal Party. The Federal party and the Marxist parties began to attack the Senanayake government, but at that time their support in the country was minimal. The greatest threat to Senanayake's policies came when Bandaranaike left the Senanayake cabinet and formed the Sinhala nationalist [[Sri Lanka Freedom Party]] (Sri Lanka Nidahas Pakshaya)(SLFP).  Senanayake died in a horse riding accident in 1952, and after that the  low-key, behind-the-curtain approach of Senanayake was displaced by direct communal agitation for lingusitic and other demands of the two communities, led by the SLFP and the ITAK. The "satyagraha" sit-ins of the ITAK developed into violent confrontations which, over time lead to the emergence of the Tamil United Liberation Front [[TULF]] which in 1976 declared, in the city of Vaddukkoddei , a policy of a separate state for the Tamils. This was an idea which had been part of the thinking of the ITAK since its inception, although it did not come to the fore-front till 1976.

'''St Piran's Day''' ({{lang-kw|Gool Peran}}) is the [[List of county days in the United Kingdom|county day]] of [[Cornwall]],&lt;ref name="Mirror"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.mirror.co.uk/sport/top-10s/2010/03/05/st-piran-s-day-10-things-you-need-to-know-about-the-annual-cornish-day-115875-22088636/|title=St Piran's Day: 10 things you need to know about the annual Cornish day|date=5 March 2010|work=The Mirror|publisher=Mirror.co.uk|accessdate=18 March 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; held on 5 March every year. The day is named after one of the [[patron saint]]s of Cornwall, [[Saint Piran]], who is also the patron saint of tin miners.

==Origins==
{{Main article|Saint Piran}}
St Piran's Day started as one of the many tinners' holidays observed by the [[tin]] [[Mining in Cornwall and Devon|miners of Cornwall]].&lt;ref name=historicuk&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.historic-uk.com/CultureUK/Saint-Pirans-Day/|title=St Piran's Day, 5th March – The Patron Saint of Cornwall|publisher=|accessdate=5 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other miners' holidays of a similar nature include [[Picrous Day]] and [[Chewidden Thursday]]. The miners of Breage and Germoe observed St Piran's feast day as that of their patron saint until at least 1764.&lt;ref&gt;Attwater, D. (1965) ''The Penguin Dictionary of Saints''. Penguin Books; p. 288&lt;/ref&gt;

"St. Piran's Day was said to be a favourite with the tinners who having a tradition that some secrets regarding the manufacture of tin were communicated to their ancestors by that saint, they leave the manufacture to shift for itself for that day, and keep it as a holiday."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sacred-texts.com/neu/eng/prwe/prwe339.htm Hunt, Robt., ''Popular Romances of the West of England'']&lt;/ref&gt; There is little description of specific traditions associated with this day apart from the consumption of large amounts of alcohol and food during 'Perrantide', the week leading up to 5 March.&lt;ref name=historicuk/&gt; The day following the St Piran's Day was known by many as 'Mazey Day', a term which has now been adopted by the revived [[Golowan]] festival in [[Penzance]]. The phrase 'drunk as a perraner' was used in 19th century Cornwall to describe people who had consumed large quantities of alcohol.&lt;ref name=culture&gt;[http://www.cornishculture.co.uk/piran.htm "St. Piran's Day", Cornish Culture]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Revival==
[[File:Coinagehall Street Helston - geograph.org.uk - 1300507.jpg|thumb|A re-enactment of Piran crossing the [[Irish Sea]], Helston, 2009]]
The modern observance of St Piran's day as a national symbol of the people of Cornwall started in the late 19th and early 20th century when [[Celtic Revival]]ists sought to provide the people of Cornwall with a national day similar to those observed in other nations. Since the 1950s, the celebration has become increasingly observed and since the start of the 21st century almost every Cornish community holds some sort of celebration to mark the event. [[Saint Piran's Flag]] is also seen flying throughout Cornwall on this day.&lt;ref name=culture/&gt;

Parades and celebrations take place in a number of towns and cities including:&lt;ref name=andaras&gt;[http://www.an-daras.com/cutoms/cu_stpirans_events.htm An Daras] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120126105453/http://www.an-daras.com/cutoms/cu_stpirans_events.htm |date=26 January 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==St Piran's Day Bank Holiday proposals==
In 2006 Cornish MP [[Dan Rogerson]] asked the government to make 5 March a public holiday in Cornwall to recognise St Piran's Day celebrations. Some council workers in [[Bodmin]] were granted the holiday in 2006,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/cornwall/5039440.stm   |title=BBC news 2006 – St Piran's holiday for employees |publisher=BBC | date=2 June 2006 | accessdate=24 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; and from 2009 Penzance Town Council offered its employees a St Piran's Day Holiday following a campaign by the [[Celtic League (political organisation)|Celtic League]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://groups.yahoo.com/group/celtic_league/message/2652|title=Yahoo! Groups|publisher=|accessdate=5 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; A total of nine town and city councils across Cornwall have given their staff the day off.

There have been other calls and petitions for a Cornish public holiday on 5 March. It has been suggested that a move from the [[May Day|May Day Bank Holiday]] to a St Piran's Day Bank Holiday in Cornwall would be worth £20–35&amp;nbsp;million to the Cornish economy.&lt;ref&gt;Western Morning News, Cornish National Holiday worth £35m, 23 November 2011 – http://www.thisiscornwall.co.uk/Cornish-national-holiday-worth-pound-35m/story-13929647-detail/story.html?dwrMeth=addComment&amp;afterReg=Y&lt;/ref&gt;

In December 2011 [[Cornwall Council]] voted in favour of asking the government to make St Piran's Day a bank holiday in Cornwall, should they decide to move the May Day holiday.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thisiscornwall.co.uk/Council-votes-St-Piran-s-Day-break-date-goes/story-14009395-detail/story.html |title=St Piran's Day holiday put to Government by council |publisher=This is Cornwall |date=8 December 2011 |accessdate=2 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A petition for a county wide day off at the Cornwall council website, closed with only 363 signatures, and fell far short of the 50,000 signatures required.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.freepetition.co.uk/cornwall/Mostpopularpetitions.aspx?PageId=7|title=ePetition|publisher=|accessdate=5 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.freepetition.co.uk/cornwall/SignPetition.aspx?ppcode=%20P2ID24620154515|title=ePetition|publisher=|accessdate=5 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.celticleague.net/news/st-pirans-day-petition/|title=St Piran's Day Petition "  The Celtic League|publisher=|accessdate=5 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The show was held on the second weekend in May, at Westside Farm, [[Stoke Goldington]], for most of its approximately thirty-five year life, with the first show in 1976. The show was run by villagers and exhibit experts from the surrounding villages, and was set up to provide funds for the Stoke Goldington Village Hall which was opened in 1976. 

The events were set on a {{convert|40|acre|m2|adj=on}} site on a hillside above the village.

The '''Taurids''' are an annual [[meteor shower]], associated with the [[comet]] [[Comet Encke|Encke]]. The Taurids are actually two separate showers, with a Southern and a Northern component. The Southern Taurids originated from Comet Encke, while the Northern Taurids originated from the asteroid [[2004 TG10|2004 TG&lt;sub&gt;10&lt;/sub&gt;]].&lt;ref name="Taurids 2017"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://patch.com/us/across-america/taurids-meteor-shower-fireballs-peak-dates-what-expect|title=Taurids Meteor Shower Fireballs: Peak Dates, What To Expect|author=Beth Dalbey|date=24 October 2017|accessdate=11 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; They are named after their [[Radiant (meteor shower)|radiant]] point in the constellation [[Taurus (constellation)|Taurus]], where they are seen to come from in the sky. Because of their occurrence in late October and early November, they are also called [[Halloween]] [[Meteoroid#Fireball|fireballs]].

Encke and the Taurids are believed to be remnants of a much larger comet, which has disintegrated over the past 20,000 to 30,000 years,&lt;ref name=Babadzhanov2008/&gt; breaking into several pieces and releasing material by normal [[Coma (cometary)|cometary activity]] or perhaps occasionally by close encounters with the [[tidal force]] of [[Earth]] or other planets ([[Fred Whipple|Whipple]], 1940; Klačka, 1999). In total, this stream of matter is the largest in the inner [[solar system]]. Since the meteor stream is rather spread out in space, Earth takes several weeks to pass through it, causing an extended period of meteor activity, compared with the much smaller periods of activity in other showers. The Taurids are also made up of weightier material, [[pebble]]s instead of [[dust]] grains.&lt;ref name="NASA2005"/&gt;

==Appearance==
Typically, Taurids appear at a rate of about 5 per hour, moving slowly across the sky at about 28 [[kilometers per second]] (17 mi/s), or 100,800 km/h (65,000 mph).&lt;ref name="NASA2005"/&gt; If larger than a pebble, these meteors may become [[bolide]]s as bright as the moon and leave behind smoke trails.&lt;ref name="NASA2005"/&gt;

Due to the gravitational [[Perturbation (astronomy)|perturbations]] of [[planet]]s, especially [[Jupiter]], the Taurids have spread out over time, allowing separate segments labeled the '''Northern Taurids''' (NTA) and '''Southern Taurids''' (STA) to become observable. The Southern Taurids are active from about September 10 to November 20, while the Northern Taurids are active from about October 20 to December 10. Essentially these are two cross sections of a single, broad, continuous stream in space. The [[Beta Taurids]] and [[Zeta Perseids]], encountered by the Earth in June/July, are also cross sections of the stream that approach from the Earth's daytime side and, as such, cannot be observed visually in the way the (night-time) Northern and Southern Taurids of October/November can. Astronomers [[Duncan Steel]] and [[Bill Napier]] even suggest the Beta Taurids could be the cause of the [[Tunguska event]] of June 30, 1908.&lt;ref name=NG&gt;[http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2003/11/1107_031107_taurids.html Meteor Shower Promises Seven Shooting Stars an Hour] – [[National Geographic (magazine)|National Geographic]] News (November 7, 2003)&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1962 and 1963, the [[Mars 1]] probe recorded one micrometeorite strike every two minutes at altitudes ranging from {{convert|6000|to|40000|km|mi|abbr=on}} from Earth's surface due to the Taurids meteor shower, and also recorded similar densities at distances from {{convert|20|to|40|e6km|mi}} from Earth.&lt;ref name='Sputnik 23'&gt;{{cite web | url = http://jtgnew.sjrdesign.net/exploration_space_planetary_mars.html | title = "Journey Through the Galaxy" Mars Program: Mars ~ 1960-1974 | accessdate = 2014-01-26 | last = Robbins | first = Stuart | date = 2008 | publisher = SJR Design}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name='Mihos 2006'&gt;{{cite web | url = http://burro.astr.cwru.edu/stu/advanced/20th_soviet_mars.html | title = Mars (1960-1974): Mars 1 | accessdate = 2014-01-26 | last = Mihos | first = Chris | date = 11 January 2006 | work = Department of Astronomy, Case Western Reserve University. | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20131013211415/http://burro.astr.cwru.edu/stu/advanced/20th_soviet_mars.html | archivedate = 13 October 2013 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Taurid stream has a cycle of activity that peaks roughly every 2,500 to 3,000 years,&lt;ref name=NG/&gt; when the core of the stream passes nearer to Earth and produces more intense showers. In fact, because of the separate "branches" (night-time in one part of the year and daytime in another; and Northern/Southern in each case) there are two (possibly overlapping) peaks separated by a few centuries, every 3000 years. Some astronomers note that dates for [[megalith]] structures such as [[Stonehenge]] are associated with these peaks.{{citation needed|date=November 2012}} The next peak is expected around 3000 [[anno domini|AD]].&lt;ref name=NG/&gt;

The Taurids also have more frequent peaks which may result from a heavier concentration of material in the stream, which only encounter Earth during some passes.

== Fireballs ==
In 1993, it was predicted that there would be a swarm of activity in 2005.&lt;ref name="NASA2005"/&gt; Around Halloween in 2005, many fireballs were witnessed that affected people's night vision.&lt;ref name="NASA2005"/&gt; Astronomers have taken to calling these the "Halloween fireballs."&lt;ref name="NASA2005"/&gt;

During the Southern Taurid meteor shower in 2013, fireball sightings were spotted over southern California, Arizona, Nevada, and Utah.&lt;ref name="BSkyB"&gt;{{cite news |author=Sky News US Team |date=2013-11-07 |title=Meteor 'Fireball' Lights Up California Sky |url=http://news.sky.com/story/1165152/meteor-fireball-lights-up-california-sky |website=news.sky.com |location=London, UK |publisher=[[BSkyB]] |accessdate=2013-11-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Meteor impact on the Moon ==
An [[impact event]] was observed by [[NASA]] scientist [[Rob Suggs]] and astronomer Bill Cooke on November 7, 2005, while testing out a new 250-mm (10 in) telescope and video camera they had assembled to monitor the moon for meteor strikes.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/sci/tech/4570730.stm BBC News: Nasa team sees explosion on Moon] (3 January 2006)&lt;/ref&gt; After consulting [[star chart]]s, they concluded that the impact body was probably part of the Taurid meteor shower. This may well be the first recording of this type of [[moon|lunar]] event which some have claimed to have witnessed in the past.&lt;ref&gt;[http://neo.jpl.nasa.gov/news/news118.html An Eyewitness Impact Debunked]&lt;/ref&gt;

}}'''''The Markup''''' is an American [[nonprofit organization]] based in [[New York City]] that will focus on [[Data-driven journalism|data driven journalism]] covering the ethics and impact of technology on society. Markup was co-founded by two former [[ProPublica]] journalists [[Julia Angwin]] and [[Jeff Larson (journalist)|Jeff Larson]]. The idea was conceived in April 2018, and expects to launch in early 2019.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.niemanlab.org/2018/04/former-propublica-journalists-are-launching-a-newsroom-to-cover-the-impact-of-technology-on-society/|title=Former ProPublica journalists are launching a newsroom to cover the impact of technology on society|last=Owen|first=Laura H.|date=2018-04-12|work=Nieman Lab|access-date=2018-09-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Data journalism ==
According to Julia Angwin, The Markup plans to collect and create public data sets through [[Freedom of Information Act (United States)|public records]] requests, automated data collection, crowdsourcing of information and creation of tools, for example at ProPublica they built a browser extension to analyze [[Facebook]] ads.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.recode.net/2018/9/27/17908798/julia-angwin-markup-jeff-larson-craig-newmark-data-investigative-journalism-peter-kafka-podcast|title=It may be ‘data journalism,’ but Julia Angwin’s new site the Markup is nothing like FiveThirtyEight|work=Recode|access-date=2018-10-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Funding ==
The Markup received $20 million gift from [[Craigslist]] founder [[Craig Newmark]]. They also raised $2 million from the [[John S. and James L. Knight Foundation|Knight Foundation]] and an additional $1 million from [[Ford Foundation]], [[MacArthur Foundation]] and the Ethics and Governance of Artificial Intelligence Initiative.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;
